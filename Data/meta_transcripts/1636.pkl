VOn March 14, this year,
p4
aVI posted this poster on Facebook.
p5
aVThis is an image of me and my daughter
p6
aVholding the Israeli flag.
p7
aVI will try to explain to you about the context of why
p8
aVand when I posted.
p9
aa(lp10
VA few days ago, I was sitting waiting
p11
aVon the line at the grocery store,
p12
aVand the owner and one of the clients
p13
aVwere talking to each other,
p14
aVand the owner was explaining to the client
p15
aVthat we're going to get 10,000 missiles on Israel.
p16
aVAnd the client was saying, no, it's 10,000 a day.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
V("10,000 missiles") This is the context. This is where we are now in Israel.
p20
aVWe have this war with Iran coming for 10 years now,
p21
aVand we have people, you know, afraid.
p22
aVIt's like every year it's the last minute
p23
aVthat we can do something about the war with Iran.
p24
aVIt's like, if we don't act now, it's too late forever,
p25
aVfor 10 years now.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo at some point it became, you know, to me,
p28
aVI'm a graphic designer, so I made posters about it
p29
aVand I posted the one I just showed you before.
p30
aVMost of the time, I make posters, I post them on Facebook,
p31
aVmy friends like it, don't like it,
p32
aVmost of the time don't like it, don't share it,
p33
aVdon't nothing,
p34
aVand it's another day.
p35
aVSo I went to sleep, and that was it for me.
p36
aVAnd later on in the night, I woke up
p37
aVbecause I'm always waking up in the night,
p38
aVand I went by the computer and I see all these red dots,
p39
aVyou know, on Facebook, which I've never seen before.
p40
aV(Laughter)
p41
aVAnd I was like, "What's going on?"
p42
aVSo I come to the computer and I start looking on,
p43
aVand suddenly I see many people talking to me,
p44
aVmost of them I don't know,
p45
aVand a few of them from Iran,
p46
aVwhich is \u2014 What?
p47
aVBecause you have to understand,
p48
aVin Israel we don't talk with people from Iran.
p49
aVWe don't know people from Iran.
p50
aVIt's like, on Facebook, you have friends only from \u2014
p51
aVit's like your neighbors are your friends on Facebook.
p52
aVAnd now people from Iran are talking to me.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo I start answering this girl, and she's telling me
p55
aVshe saw the poster and she asked her family to come,
p56
aVbecause they don't have a computer, she asked her family
p57
aVto come to see the poster, and they're all sitting in the living room crying.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo I'm like, whoa.
p60
aVI ask my wife to come, and I tell her, you have to see that.
p61
aVPeople are crying, and she came, she read the text,
p62
aVand she started to cry.
p63
aVAnd everybody's crying now. (Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VSo I don't know what to do, so my first reflex,
p66
aVas a graphic designer, is, you know, to show everybody
p67
aVwhat I'd just seen, and people started to see them
p68
aVand to share them, and that's how it started.
p69
aVThe day after, when really it became a lot of talking,
p70
aVI said to myself, and my wife said to me,
p71
aVI also want a poster,
p72
aVso this is her. (Laughter)
p73
aVBecause it's working, put me in a poster now.
p74
aa(lp75
VBut more seriously, I was like, okay, these ones work,
p76
aVbut it's not just about me, it's about people from Israel
p77
aVwho want to say something.
p78
aVSo I'm going to shoot all the people I know, if they want,
p79
aVand I'm going to put them in a poster and I'm going to share them.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo I went to my neighbors and friends and students
p82
aVand I just asked them, give me a picture, I will make you a poster.
p83
aVAnd that's how it started. And that's how, really,
p84
aVit's unleashed, because suddenly people
p85
aVfrom Facebook, friends and others,
p86
aVjust understand that they can be part of it.
p87
aVIt's not just one dude making one poster,
p88
aVit's \u2014 we can be part of it, so they start sending me pictures
p89
aVand ask me, "Make me a poster. Post it.
p90
aVTell the Iranians we from Israel love you too."
p91
aVIt became, you know, at some point it was really, really intense.
p92
aVI mean, so many pictures, so I asked friends
p93
aVto come, graphic designers most of them,
p94
aVto make posters with me, because I didn't have the time.
p95
aVIt was a huge amount of pictures.
p96
aVSo for a few days, that's how my living room was.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd we received Israeli posters, Israeli images,
p99
aVbut also lots of comments, lots of messages from Iran.
p100
aVAnd we took these messages and we made posters out of it,
p101
aVbecause I know people: They don't read, they see images.
p102
aVIf it's an image, they may read it.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo here are a few of them.
p105
aa(lp106
V("You are my first Israelian friend. I wish we both get rid of our idiot politicians, anyway nice to see you!")
p107
aa(lp108
V("I love that blue. I love that star. I love that flag.") This one is really moving for me because it's the story
p109
aVof a girl who has been raised in Iran
p110
aVto walk on an Israeli flag to enter her school every morning,
p111
aVand now that she sees the posters that we're sending,
p112
aVshe starts \u2014 she said that she changed her mind,
p113
aVand now she loves that blue, she loves that star,
p114
aVand she loves that flag, talking about the Israeli flag,
p115
aVand she wished that we'd meet and come to visit one another,
p116
aVand just a few days after I posted the first poster.
p117
aa(lp118
VThe day after,
p119
aVIranians started to respond with their own posters.
p120
aVThey have graphic designers. What? (Laughter)
p121
aVCrazy, crazy.
p122
aVSo you can see they are still shy, they don't want to show their faces,
p123
aVbut they want to spread the message.
p124
aVThey want to respond. They want to say the same thing.
p125
aVSo. And now it's communication.
p126
aVIt's a two-way story. It's Israelis and Iranians
p127
aVsending the same message, one to each other.
p128
aa(lp129
V("My Israeli Friends. I don't hate you. I don't want War.")
p130
aa(lp131
VThis never happened before, and this is two people
p132
aVsupposed to be enemies, we're on the verge of a war,
p133
aVand suddenly people on Facebook are starting to say,
p134
aV"I like this guy. I love those guys."
p135
aVAnd it became really big at some point.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd then it became news.
p138
aVBecause when you're seeing the Middle East, you see only the bad news.
p139
aVAnd suddenly, there is something that was happening
p140
aVthat was good news. So the guys on the news,
p141
aVthey say, "Okay, let's talk about this."
p142
aVAnd they just came, and it was so much,
p143
aa(lp144
VI remember one day, Michal,
p145
aVshe was talking with the journalist, and she was asking him,
p146
aV"Who's gonna see the show?"And he said, "Everybody."
p147
aa(lp148
VSo she said, "Everybody in Palestine, in where? Israel?
p149
aVWho is everybody?""Everybody."
p150
aa(lp151
VThey said, "Syria?" "Syria."
p152
aa(lp153
V"Lebanon?""Lebanon."
p154
aVAt some point, he just said, "40 million people are going to see you today.
p155
aVIt's everybody." The Chinese.
p156
aVAnd we were just at the beginning of the story.
p157
aa(lp158
VSomething crazy also happened.
p159
aVEvery time a country started talking about it,
p160
aVlike Germany, America, wherever,
p161
aVa page on Facebook popped up with the same logo
p162
aVwith the same stories, so at the beginning
p163
aVwe had "Iran-Loves-Israel," which is an Iranian
p164
aVsitting in Tehran, saying, "Okay, Israel loves Iran?
p165
aVI give you Iran-Loves-Israel."
p166
aVYou have Palestine-Loves-Israel.
p167
aVYou have Lebanon that just \u2014 a few days ago.
p168
aVAnd this whole list of pages on Facebook
p169
aVdedicated to the same message,
p170
aVto people sending their love, one to each other.
p171
aa(lp172
VThe moment I really understood that something was happening,
p173
aVa friend of mine told me,
p174
aV"Google the word 'Israel.'"
p175
aVAnd those were the first images on those days
p176
aVthat popped up from Google
p177
aVwhen you were typing, "Israel" or "Iran."
p178
aVWe really changed how people see the Middle East.
p179
aVBecause you're not in the Middle East.
p180
aVYou're somewhere over there, and then you want to see the Middle East,
p181
aVso you go on Google and you say, "Israel,"
p182
aVand they give you the bad stuff.
p183
aVAnd for a few days you got those images.
p184
aVToday the Israel-Loves-Iran page
p185
aVis this number, 80,831, and two million people last week
p186
aVwent on the page and shared, liked, I don't know,
p187
aVcommented on one of the photos.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo for five months now, that's what we are doing,
p190
aVme, Michal, a few of my friends, are just making images.
p191
aVWe're showing a new reality
p192
aVby just making images
p193
aVbecause that's how the world perceives us.
p194
aVThey see images of us, and they see bad images.
p195
aVSo we're working on making good images. End of story.
p196
aa(lp197
VLook at this one. This is the Iran-Loves-Israel page.
p198
aVThis is not the Israel-Loves-Iran. This is not my page.
p199
aVThis is a guy in Tehran on the day of remembrance
p200
aVof the Israeli fallen soldier
p201
aVputting an image of an Israeli soldier on his page.
p202
aVThis is the enemy.
p203
aVWhat?
p204
aa(lp205
V("Our heartfelt condolences to the families who lost their dearests in terror attack in Bulgaria")
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd it's going both ways.
p208
aVIt's like, we are showing respect, one to each other.
p209
aVAnd we're understanding. And you show compassion.
p210
aVAnd you become friends.
p211
aVAnd at some point, you become friends on Facebook,
p212
aVand you become friends in life.
p213
aVYou can go and travel and meet people.
p214
aVAnd I was in Munich a few weeks ago.
p215
aVI went there to open an exposition about Iran
p216
aVand I met there with people from the page
p217
aVthat told me, "Okay, you're going to be in Europe,
p218
aVI'm coming. I'm coming from France, from Holland,
p219
aVfrom Germany," of course, and from Israel people came,
p220
aVand we just met there for the first time in real life.
p221
aVI met with people that are supposed to be my enemies
p222
aVfor the first time. And we just shake hands,
p223
aVand have a coffee and a nice discussion,
p224
aVand we talk about food and basketball.
p225
aVAnd that was the end of it.
p226
aVRemember that image from the beginning?
p227
aVAt some point we met in real life, and we became friends.
p228
aa(lp229
VAnd it goes the other way around.
p230
aVSome girl that we met on Facebook
p231
aVnever been in Israel, born and raised in Iran,
p232
aVlives in Germany, afraid of Israelis
p233
aVbecause of what she knows about us,
p234
aVdecides after a few months of talking on the Internet
p235
aVwith some Israelis to come to Israel,
p236
aVand she gets on the plane and arrives at Ben Gurion
p237
aVand says, "Okay, not that big a deal."
p238
aa(lp239
VSo a few weeks ago, the stress is getting higher,
p240
aVso we start this new campaign
p241
aVcalled "Not ready to die in your war."
p242
aVI mean, it's plus/minus the same message,
p243
aVbut we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it.
p244
aVAnd again, something amazing happened,
p245
aVsomething that we didn't have on the first wave of the campaign.
p246
aVNow people from Iran, the same ones who were shy
p247
aVat the first campaign and just sent, you know,
p248
aVtheir foot and half their faces,
p249
aVnow they're sending their faces, and they're saying,
p250
aV"Okay, no problem, we're into it. We are with you."
p251
aVJust read where those guys are from.
p252
aVAnd for every guy from Israel,
p253
aVyou've got someone from Iran.
p254
aVJust people sending their pictures.
p255
aVCrazy, yes?
p256
aa(lp257
VSo \u2014
p258
aV(Applause)
p259
aa(lp260
VSo you may ask yourself, who is this dude?
p261
aa(lp262
VMy name is Ronny Edry, and I'm 41, I'm an Israeli,
p263
aVI'm a father of two, I'm a husband,
p264
aVand I'm a graphic designer. I'm teaching graphic design.
p265
aVAnd I'm not that naive, because a lot of the time
p266
aVI've been asked, many times I've been asked, "Yeah, but,
p267
aVthis is really naive, sending flowers over, I mean \u2014 "
p268
aa(lp269
VI was in the army. I was in the paratroopers for three years,
p270
aVand I know how it looks from the ground.
p271
aVI know how it can look really bad.
p272
aVSo to me, this is the courageous thing to do,
p273
aVto try to reach the other side before it's too late,
p274
aVbecause when it's going to be too late, it's going to be too late.
p275
aVAnd sometimes war is inevitable, sometimes,
p276
aVbut maybe [with] effort, we can avoid it.
p277
aVMaybe as people, because especially in Israel,
p278
aVwe're in a democracy. We have the freedom of speech,
p279
aVand maybe that little thing can change something.
p280
aVAnd really, we can be our own ambassadors.
p281
aVWe can just send a message and hope for the best.
p282
aa(lp283
VSo I want to ask Michal, my wife, to come with me
p284
aVon the stage just to make with you one image,
p285
aVbecause it's all about images.
p286
aVAnd maybe that image will help us change something.
p287
aVJust raise that. Exactly.
p288
aVAnd I'm just going to take a picture of it,
p289
aVand I'm just going to post it on Facebook
p290
aVwith kind of "Israelis for peace" or something.
p291
aa(lp292
VOh my God.
p293
aVDon't cry.
p294
aa(lp295
VThank you guys.
