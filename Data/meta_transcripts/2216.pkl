VI'm thrilled to be here tonight
p4
aVto share with you something we've been working on
p5
aVfor over two years,
p6
aVand it's in the area of additive manufacturing,
p7
aValso known as 3D printing.
p8
aa(lp9
VYou see this object here.
p10
aVIt looks fairly simple, but it's quite complex at the same time.
p11
aVIt's a set of concentric geodesic structures
p12
aVwith linkages between each one.
p13
aVIn its context, it is not manufacturable by traditional manufacturing techniques.
p14
aVIt has a symmetry such that you can't injection mold it.
p15
aVYou can't even manufacture it through milling.
p16
aVThis is a job for a 3D printer,
p17
aVbut most 3D printers would take between three and 10 hours to fabricate it,
p18
aVand we're going to take the risk tonight to try to fabricate it onstage
p19
aVduring this 10-minute talk.
p20
aVWish us luck.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow, 3D printing is actually a misnomer.
p23
aVIt's actually 2D printing over and over again,
p24
aVand it in fact uses the technologies associated with 2D printing.
p25
aVThink about inkjet printing where you lay down ink on a page to make letters,
p26
aVand then do that over and over again to build up a three-dimensional object.
p27
aVIn microelectronics, they use something
p28
aVcalled lithography to do the same sort of thing,
p29
aVto make the transistors and integrated circuits
p30
aVand build up a structure several times.
p31
aVThese are all 2D printing technologies.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, I'm a chemist, a material scientist too,
p34
aVand my co-inventors are also material scientists,
p35
aVone a chemist, one a physicist,
p36
aVand we began to be interested in 3D printing.
p37
aVAnd very often, as you know, new ideas are often simple connections
p38
aVbetween people with different experiences in different communities,
p39
aVand that's our story.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow, we were inspired
p42
aVby the "Terminator 2" scene for T-1000,
p43
aVand we thought, why couldn't a 3D printer operate in this fashion,
p44
aVwhere you have an object arise out of a puddle
p45
aVin essentially real time
p46
aVwith essentially no waste
p47
aVto make a great object?
p48
aVOkay, just like the movies.
p49
aVAnd could we be inspired by Hollywood
p50
aVand come up with ways to actually try to get this to work?
p51
aVAnd that was our challenge.
p52
aVAnd our approach would be, if we could do this,
p53
aVthen we could fundamentally address the three issues holding back 3D printing
p54
aVfrom being a manufacturing process.
p55
aa(lp56
VOne, 3D printing takes forever.
p57
aVThere are mushrooms that grow faster than 3D printed parts. (Laughter)
p58
aVThe layer by layer process
p59
aVleads to defects in mechanical properties,
p60
aVand if we could grow continuously, we could eliminate those defects.
p61
aVAnd in fact, if we could grow really fast, we could also start using materials
p62
aVthat are self-curing, and we could have amazing properties.
p63
aVSo if we could pull this off, imitate Hollywood,
p64
aVwe could in fact address 3D manufacturing.
p65
aa(lp66
VOur approach is to use some standard knowledge
p67
aVin polymer chemistry
p68
aVto harness light and oxygen to grow parts continuously.
p69
aVLight and oxygen work in different ways.
p70
aVLight can take a resin and convert it to a solid,
p71
aVcan convert a liquid to a solid.
p72
aVOxygen inhibits that process.
p73
aVSo light and oxygen are polar opposites from one another
p74
aVfrom a chemical point of view,
p75
aVand if we can control spatially the light and oxygen,
p76
aVwe could control this process.
p77
aVAnd we refer to this as CLIP. [Continuous Liquid Interface Production.]
p78
aVIt has three functional components.
p79
aVOne, it has a reservoir that holds the puddle,
p80
aVjust like the T-1000.
p81
aVAt the bottom of the reservoir is a special window.
p82
aVI'll come back to that.
p83
aVIn addition, it has a stage that will lower into the puddle
p84
aVand pull the object out of the liquid.
p85
aVThe third component is a digital light projection system
p86
aVunderneath the reservoir,
p87
aVilluminating with light in the ultraviolet region.
p88
aa(lp89
VNow, the key is that this window in the bottom of this reservoir,
p90
aVit's a composite, it's a very special window.
p91
aVIt's not only transparent to light but it's permeable to oxygen.
p92
aVIt's got characteristics like a contact lens.
p93
aVSo we can see how the process works.
p94
aVYou can start to see that as you lower a stage in there,
p95
aVin a traditional process, with an oxygen-impermeable window,
p96
aVyou make a two-dimensional pattern
p97
aVand you end up gluing that onto the window with a traditional window,
p98
aVand so in order to introduce the next layer, you have to separate it,
p99
aVintroduce new resin, reposition it,
p100
aVand do this process over and over again.
p101
aVBut with our very special window,
p102
aVwhat we're able to do is, with oxygen coming through the bottom
p103
aVas light hits it,
p104
aVthat oxygen inhibits the reaction,
p105
aVand we form a dead zone.
p106
aVThis dead zone is on the order of tens of microns thick,
p107
aVso that's two or three diameters of a red blood cell,
p108
aVright at the window interface that remains a liquid,
p109
aVand we pull this object up,
p110
aVand as we talked about in a Science paper,
p111
aVas we change the oxygen content, we can change the dead zone thickness.
p112
aVAnd so we have a number of key variables that we control: oxygen content,
p113
aVthe light, the light intensity, the dose to cure,
p114
aVthe viscosity, the geometry,
p115
aVand we use very sophisticated software to control this process.
p116
aa(lp117
VThe result is pretty staggering.
p118
aVIt's 25 to 100 times faster than traditional 3D printers,
p119
aVwhich is game-changing.
p120
aVIn addition, as our ability to deliver liquid to that interface,
p121
aVwe can go 1,000 times faster I believe,
p122
aVand that in fact opens up the opportunity for generating a lot of heat,
p123
aVand as a chemical engineer, I get very excited at heat transfer
p124
aVand the idea that we might one day have water-cooled 3D printers,
p125
aVbecause they're going so fast.
p126
aVIn addition, because we're growing things, we eliminate the layers,
p127
aVand the parts are monolithic.
p128
aVYou don't see the surface structure.
p129
aVYou have molecularly smooth surfaces.
p130
aVAnd the mechanical properties of most parts made in a 3D printer
p131
aVare notorious for having properties that depend on the orientation
p132
aVwith which how you printed it, because of the layer-like structure.
p133
aVBut when you grow objects like this,
p134
aVthe properties are invariant with the print direction.
p135
aVThese look like injection-molded parts,
p136
aVwhich is very different than traditional 3D manufacturing.
p137
aVIn addition, we're able to throw
p138
aVthe entire polymer chemistry textbook at this,
p139
aVand we're able to design chemistries that can give rise to the properties
p140
aVyou really want in a 3D-printed object.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Applause)
p143
aa(lp144
VThere it is. That's great.
p145
aVYou always take the risk that something like this won't work onstage, right?
p146
aa(lp147
VBut we can have materials with great mechanical properties.
p148
aVFor the first time, we can have elastomers
p149
aVthat are high elasticity or high dampening.
p150
aVThink about vibration control or great sneakers, for example.
p151
aVWe can make materials that have incredible strength,
p152
aVhigh strength-to-weight ratio, really strong materials,
p153
aVreally great elastomers,
p154
aVso throw that in the audience there.
p155
aVSo great material properties.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd so the opportunity now, if you actually make a part
p158
aVthat has the properties to be a final part,
p159
aVand you do it in game-changing speeds,
p160
aVyou can actually transform manufacturing.
p161
aVRight now, in manufacturing, what happens is,
p162
aVthe so-called digital thread in digital manufacturing.
p163
aVWe go from a CAD drawing, a design, to a prototype to manufacturing.
p164
aVOften, the digital thread is broken right at prototype,
p165
aVbecause you can't go all the way to manufacturing
p166
aVbecause most parts don't have the properties to be a final part.
p167
aVWe now can connect the digital thread
p168
aVall the way from design to prototyping to manufacturing,
p169
aVand that opportunity really opens up all sorts of things,
p170
aVfrom better fuel-efficient cars dealing with great lattice properties
p171
aVwith high strength-to-weight ratio,
p172
aVnew turbine blades, all sorts of wonderful things.
p173
aa(lp174
VThink about if you need a stent in an emergency situation,
p175
aVinstead of the doctor pulling off a stent out of the shelf
p176
aVthat was just standard sizes,
p177
aVhaving a stent that's designed for you, for your own anatomy
p178
aVwith your own tributaries,
p179
aVprinted in an emergency situation in real time out of the properties
p180
aVsuch that the stent could go away after 18 months: really-game changing.
p181
aVOr digital dentistry, and making these kinds of structures
p182
aVeven while you're in the dentist chair.
p183
aVAnd look at the structures that my students are making
p184
aVat the University of North Carolina.
p185
aVThese are amazing microscale structures.
p186
aa(lp187
VYou know, the world is really good at nano-fabrication.
p188
aVMoore's Law has driven things from 10 microns and below.
p189
aVWe're really good at that,
p190
aVbut it's actually very hard to make things from 10 microns to 1,000 microns,
p191
aVthe mesoscale.
p192
aVAnd subtractive techniques from the silicon industry
p193
aVcan't do that very well.
p194
aVThey can't etch wafers that well.
p195
aVBut this process is so gentle,
p196
aVwe can grow these objects up from the bottom
p197
aVusing additive manufacturing
p198
aVand make amazing things in tens of seconds,
p199
aVopening up new sensor technologies,
p200
aVnew drug delivery techniques,
p201
aVnew lab-on-a-chip applications, really game-changing stuff.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo the opportunity of making a part in real time
p204
aVthat has the properties to be a final part
p205
aVreally opens up 3D manufacturing,
p206
aVand for us, this is very exciting, because this really is owning
p207
aVthe intersection between hardware, software and molecular science,
p208
aVand I can't wait to see what designers and engineers around the world
p209
aVare going to be able to do with this great tool.
p210
aa(lp211
VThanks for listening.
