VMy students often ask me, "What is sociology?"
p4
aVAnd I tell them it's the study of the way in which human beings are shaped
p5
aVby things that they don't see.
p6
aVAnd they say, "So, how can I be a sociologist?
p7
aVHow can I understand those invisible forces?"
p8
aVAnd I say, "Empathy.
p9
aVStart with empathy.
p10
aVIt all begins with empathy.
p11
aVTake yourself out of your shoes,
p12
aVput yourself into the shoes of another person."
p13
aa(lp14
VHere, I'll give you an example.
p15
aVSo I imagine my life if, a hundred years ago,
p16
aVChina had been the most powerful nation in the world
p17
aVand they came to the United States in search of coal.
p18
aVAnd they found it, and, in fact, they found lots of it right here.
p19
aVAnd pretty soon, they began shipping that coal,
p20
aVton by ton,
p21
aVrailcar by railcar, boatload by boatload,
p22
aVback to China and elsewhere around the world.
p23
aVAnd they got fabulously wealthy in doing so.
p24
aVAnd they built beautiful cities
p25
aVall powered on that coal.
p26
aVAnd back here in the United States,
p27
aVwe saw economic despair, deprivation.
p28
aVThis is what I saw.
p29
aVI saw people struggling to get by,
p30
aVnot knowing what was what and what was next.
p31
aVAnd I asked myself the question:
p32
aVHow is it possible that we could be so poor here in the United States,
p33
aVbecause coal is such a wealthy resource; it's so much money?
p34
aVAnd I realize:
p35
aVbecause the Chinese ingratiated themselves
p36
aVwith a small ruling class here in the United States,
p37
aVwho stole all of that money and all of that wealth for themselves.
p38
aVAnd the rest of us, the vast majority of us,
p39
aVstruggle to get by.
p40
aVAnd the Chinese gave this small ruling elite
p41
aVloads of military weapons and sophisticated technology
p42
aVin order to ensure that people like me
p43
aVwould not speak out against this relationship.
p44
aVDoes this sound familiar?
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd they did things like train Americans to help protect the coal.
p47
aVAnd everywhere, there were symbols of the Chinese \u2014
p48
aVeverywhere, a constant reminder.
p49
aVAnd back in China,
p50
aVwhat do they say in China?
p51
aVNothing! They don't talk about us. They don't talk about the coal.
p52
aVIf you ask them,
p53
aVthey'll say, "Well, you know, we need the coal.
p54
aVI mean, come on, I'm not going to turn down my thermostat.
p55
aVYou can't expect that."
p56
aVAnd so, I get angry, and I get pissed,
p57
aVas do lots of average people.
p58
aVAnd we fight back, and it gets really ugly.
p59
aVAnd the Chinese respond in a very ugly way.
p60
aVAnd before we know it, they send in the tanks
p61
aVand they send in the troops.
p62
aVAnd lots of people are dying.
p63
aVAnd it's a very, very difficult situation.
p64
aa(lp65
VCan you imagine what you would feel
p66
aVif you were in my shoes?
p67
aVCan you imagine walking out of this building
p68
aVand seeing a tank sitting out there,
p69
aVor a truck full of soldiers?
p70
aVJust imagine what you would feel, because you know why they're here;
p71
aVyou know what they're doing here.
p72
aVAnd you just feel the anger and you feel the fear.
p73
aVIf you can, that's empathy. That's empathy.
p74
aVYou've left your shoes, and you've stood in mine.
p75
aVAnd you've got to feel that.
p76
aa(lp77
VOK, so that's the warm-up.
p78
aVThat's the warm-up.
p79
aVNow we're going to have the real radical experiment.
p80
aVSo, for the remainder of my talk, what I want you to do
p81
aVis put yourselves in the shoes of an ordinary Arab Muslim
p82
aVliving in the Middle East \u2014
p83
aVin particular, in Iraq.
p84
aVAnd so to help you,
p85
aVperhaps you're a member of this middle-class family in Baghdad.
p86
aVWhat you want is the best for your kids.
p87
aVYou want your kids to have a better life.
p88
aVAnd you watch the news, you pay attention.
p89
aVYou read the newspaper, you go down to the coffee shop with your friends,
p90
aVyou read the newspapers from around the world.
p91
aVSometimes you even watch satellite, CNN, from the United States.
p92
aVYou have a sense of what the Americans are thinking.
p93
aVBut really, you just want a better life for yourself.
p94
aVThat's what you want.
p95
aVYou're Arab Muslim living in Iraq.
p96
aVYou want a better life for yourself.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo here, let me help you.
p99
aVLet me help you with some things that you might be thinking.
p100
aVNumber one:
p101
aVthis incursion into your land these past 20 years and before \u2014
p102
aVthe reason anyone is interested in your land,
p103
aVand particularly the United States, is oil.
p104
aVIt's all about oil; you know that, everybody knows that.
p105
aVPeople back in the United States know it's about oil.
p106
aVIt's because somebody else has a design for your resource.
p107
aVIt's your resource \u2014 it's not somebody else's.
p108
aVIt's your land; it's your resource.
p109
aVSomebody else has a design for it.
p110
aVAnd you know why they have a design?
p111
aVYou know why they have their eyes set on it?
p112
aVBecause they have an entire economic system
p113
aVthat's dependent on that oil \u2014 foreign oil,
p114
aVoil from other parts of the world that they don't own.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd what else do you think about these people?
p117
aVThe Americans, they're rich.
p118
aVCome on, they live in big houses, they have big cars.
p119
aVThey all have blond hair, blue eyes. They're happy.
p120
aVYou think that. It's not true, of course, but that's the media impression.
p121
aVAnd that's what you get.
p122
aVAnd they have big cities,
p123
aVand the cities are all dependent on oil.
p124
aVAnd back home, what do you see?
p125
aVPoverty, despair, struggle.
p126
aVLook, you don't live in a wealthy country.
p127
aVI mean \u2014 this is Iraq.
p128
aVThis is what you see.
p129
aVYou see people struggling to get by.
p130
aVIt's not easy; you see a lot of poverty.
p131
aVAnd you feel something about this.
p132
aVThese people have designs for your resource,
p133
aVand this is what you see?
p134
aa(lp135
VSomething else you see that you talk about \u2014
p136
aVAmericans don't talk about this, but you do \u2014
p137
aVthere's this thing, this militarization of the world,
p138
aVand it's centered right in the United States.
p139
aVAnd the United States is responsible
p140
aVfor almost one half of the world's military spending.
p141
aVFour percent of the world's population!
p142
aVAnd you feel it; you see it every day.
p143
aVIt's part of your life.
p144
aVAnd you talk about it with your friends.
p145
aVYou read about it.
p146
aVAnd back when Saddam Hussein was in power,
p147
aVthe Americans didn't care about his crimes.
p148
aVWhen he was gassing the Kurds and gassing Iran,
p149
aVthey didn't care about it.
p150
aVWhen oil was at stake,
p151
aVsomehow, suddenly, things mattered.
p152
aVAnd what you see, something else:
p153
aVthe United States,
p154
aVthe hub of democracy around the world \u2014
p155
aVthey don't seem to really be supporting democratic countries
p156
aVall around the world.
p157
aVThere are a lot of countries, oil-producing countries,
p158
aVthat aren't very democratic, but supported by the United States.
p159
aVThat's odd.
p160
aa(lp161
VOh \u2014 these incursions, these two wars,
p162
aVthe 10 years of sanctions,
p163
aVthe eight years of occupation,
p164
aVthe insurgency that's been unleashed on your people,
p165
aVthe tens of thousands, the hundreds of thousands
p166
aVof civilian deaths?
p167
aVAll because of oil.
p168
aVYou can't help but think that.
p169
aVYou talk about it.
p170
aVIt's in the forefront of your mind, always.
p171
aVYou say, "How is that possible?"
p172
aVAnd this man, he's everyman \u2014
p173
aVyour grandfather, your uncle,
p174
aVyour father, your son, your neighbor,
p175
aVyour professor, your student.
p176
aVOnce a life of happiness and joy
p177
aVand suddenly, pain and sorrow.
p178
aVEveryone in your country has been touched by the violence,
p179
aVthe bloodshed, the pain, the horror \u2014 everybody.
p180
aVNot a single person in your country has not been touched.
p181
aa(lp182
VBut there's something else.
p183
aVThere's something else about these people, these Americans who are there.
p184
aVThere's something else about them that you see
p185
aVthat they don't see themselves.
p186
aVAnd what do you see? They're Christians!
p187
aVThey're Christians.
p188
aVThey worship the Christian God, they have crosses, they carry Bibles.
p189
aVTheir Bibles have a little insignia
p190
aVthat says "US Army" on them.
p191
aVAnd their leaders, their leaders:
p192
aVbefore they send their sons and daughters off to war in your country \u2014
p193
aVand you know the reason \u2014
p194
aVbefore they send them off,
p195
aVthey go to a Christian church, and they pray to their Christian God,
p196
aVand they ask for protection and guidance from that god.
p197
aVWhy?
p198
aVWell, obviously, when people die in the war,
p199
aVthey are Muslims, they are Iraqis \u2014 they're not Americans.
p200
aVYou don't want Americans to die \u2014 "Protect Our Troops."
p201
aVAnd you feel something about that \u2014
p202
aVof course you do.
p203
aVAnd they do wonderful things.
p204
aVYou read about it, you hear about it.
p205
aVThey're there to build schools and help people.
p206
aVThat's what they want to do.
p207
aVThey do wonderful things, but they also do the bad things,
p208
aVand you can't tell the difference.
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd this guy, you get a guy like Lt. Gen. William Boykin.
p211
aVHere's a guy who says that your god is a false god.
p212
aVYour god's an idol; his god is the true god.
p213
aVThe solution to the problem in the Middle East, according to him,
p214
aVis to convert you all to Christianity \u2014
p215
aVjust get rid of your religion.
p216
aVAnd you know that. Americans don't read about this guy.
p217
aVThey don't know anything about him, but you do.
p218
aVYou pass it around. You pass his words around.
p219
aVI mean, this is serious. You're afraid.
p220
aVHe was one of the leading commanders in the second invasion of Iraq.
p221
aVAnd you're thinking, "My God, if this guy is saying that,
p222
aVthen all the soldiers must be saying that."
p223
aVAnd this word here \u2014
p224
aVGeorge Bush called this war a crusade.
p225
aVMan, the Americans, they're just like, "Ah, crusade.
p226
aVWhatever. I don't know what that means."
p227
aVYou know what it means \u2014 it's a holy war against Muslims.
p228
aVLook, invade, subdue them, take their resources.
p229
aVIf they won't submit, kill them.
p230
aVThat's what this is about.
p231
aVAnd you're thinking, "My God, these Christians are coming to kill us."
p232
aVThis is frightening.
p233
aVYou feel frightened. Of course you feel frightened.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd this man, Terry Jones:
p236
aVI mean here's a guy who wants to burn Qurans, right?
p237
aVAnd the Americans: "Ah, he's a knucklehead.
p238
aVHe's a former hotel manager; he's got three dozen members of his church ..."
p239
aVThey laugh him off.
p240
aVYou don't laugh him off, because in the context of everything else,
p241
aVall the pieces fit.
p242
aVOf course this is how Americans think.
p243
aVSo people all over the Middle East, not just in your country,
p244
aVare protesting.
p245
aV"He wants to burn Qurans, our holy book.
p246
aVThese Christians \u2014 who are these Christians?
p247
aVThey're so evil, they're so mean \u2014 this is what they're about?"
p248
aVThis is what you're thinking as an Arab Muslim,
p249
aVas an Iraqi.
p250
aVOf course you're going to think this.
p251
aa(lp252
VAnd then your cousin says, "Hey coz, check out this website.
p253
aVYou've got to see this \u2014 Bible Boot Camp.
p254
aVThese Christians are nuts!
p255
aVThey're training their little kids to be soldiers for Jesus.
p256
aVThey take little kids and run them through these things
p257
aVtill they teach them how to say, 'Sir! Yes, sir!'
p258
aVand things like 'grenade toss' and 'weapons care and maintenance.'
p259
aVAnd go to the website \u2014 it says 'US Army' right on it.
p260
aVI mean, these Christians, they're nuts.
p261
aVHow can they do this to their little kids?"
p262
aVAnd you're reading this website.
p263
aVAnd of course, Christians in the United States, or anybody,
p264
aVsays, "This is some little church in the middle of nowhere."
p265
aVYou don't know that.
p266
aVFor you, this is like, all Christians.
p267
aVIt's all over the Web: "Bible Boot Camp."
p268
aVAnd look at this.
p269
aVThey even teach their kids \u2014
p270
aVthey train them in the same way the US Marines train.
p271
aVIsn't that interesting.
p272
aVAnd it scares you, and it frightens you.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo these guys, you see them.
p275
aVYou see, I, Sam Richards \u2014 I know who these guys are.
p276
aVThey're my students, my friends; I know what they're thinking.
p277
aVYou don't know.
p278
aVWhen you see them, they're something else.
p279
aVThey're something else.
p280
aVThat's what they are to you.
p281
aVWe don't see it that way in the United States,
p282
aVbut you see it that way.
p283
aVSo here.
p284
aVOf course, you've got it wrong.
p285
aVYou're generalizing. It's wrong.
p286
aVYou don't understand the Americans.
p287
aVIt's not a Christian invasion.
p288
aVWe're not just there for oil; we're there for lots of reasons.
p289
aVYou have it wrong. You've missed it.
p290
aVAnd of course, most of you don't support the insurgency;
p291
aVyou don't support killing Americans;
p292
aVyou don't support the terrorists.
p293
aVOf course you don't. Very few people do.
p294
aVBut \u2014 some of you do.
p295
aVAnd this is a perspective.
p296
aVOK. So now, here's what we're going to do.
p297
aa(lp298
VStep outside of your shoes that you're in right now,
p299
aVand step back into your normal shoes.
p300
aVSo everyone's back in the room. OK?
p301
aVNow here comes the radical experiment.
p302
aVSo we're all back home.
p303
aVThis photo: this woman \u2014
p304
aVman, I feel her.
p305
aVI feel her.
p306
aVShe's my sister,
p307
aVmy wife, my cousin, my neighbor.
p308
aVShe's anybody to me.
p309
aVThese guys standing there, everybody in the photo \u2014
p310
aVI feel this photo, man.
p311
aVSo here's what I want you to do.
p312
aa(lp313
VLet's go back to my first example, of the Chinese.
p314
aVI want you to go there.
p315
aVIt's all about coal, and the Chinese are here in the United States.
p316
aVWhat I want you to do is picture her
p317
aVas a Chinese woman receiving a Chinese flag
p318
aVbecause her loved one has died in America in the coal uprising.
p319
aVAnd the soldiers are Chinese,
p320
aVand everybody else is Chinese.
p321
aVAs an American, how do you feel about this picture?
p322
aVWhat do you think about that scene?
p323
aa(lp324
VOK, try this. Bring it back.
p325
aVThis is the scene here.
p326
aVIt's an American, American soldiers,
p327
aVAmerican woman who lost her loved one in the Middle East,
p328
aVin Iraq or Afghanistan.
p329
aVNow, put yourself in the shoes,
p330
aVgo back to the shoes of an Arab Muslim living in Iraq.
p331
aVWhat are you feeling and thinking about this photo,
p332
aVabout this woman?
p333
aa(lp334
VOK,
p335
aVnow follow me on this,
p336
aVbecause I'm taking a big risk here.
p337
aVAnd so I'm going to invite you to take a risk with me.
p338
aVThese gentlemen here, they're insurgents.
p339
aVThey were caught by the American soldiers, trying to kill Americans.
p340
aVAnd maybe they succeeded. Maybe they succeeded.
p341
aVPut yourself in the shoes of the Americans who caught them.
p342
aVCan you feel the rage?
p343
aVCan you feel that you just want to take these guys
p344
aVand wring their necks?
p345
aVCan you go there?
p346
aVIt shouldn't be that difficult.
p347
aVYou just \u2014 oh, man.
p348
aVNow, put yourself in their shoes.
p349
aVAre they brutal killers
p350
aVor patriotic defenders?
p351
aVWhich one?
p352
aVCan you feel their anger,
p353
aVtheir fear,
p354
aVtheir rage
p355
aVat what has happened in their country?
p356
aVCan you imagine that maybe one of them, in the morning,
p357
aVbent down to their child and hugged their child
p358
aVand said, "Dear, I'll be back later.
p359
aVI'm going out to defend your freedom, your lives.
p360
aVI'm going out to look out for us,
p361
aVthe future of our country."
p362
aVCan you imagine that?
p363
aVCan you imagine saying that?
p364
aVCan you go there?
p365
aVWhat do you think they're feeling?
p366
aVYou see, that's empathy.
p367
aVIt's also understanding.
p368
aa(lp369
V[understand]
p370
aa(lp371
VNow, you might ask,
p372
aV"OK, Sam, so why do you do this sort of thing?
p373
aVWhy would you use this example of all examples?"
p374
aVAnd I say, because.
p375
aVYou're allowed to hate these people.
p376
aVYou're allowed to just hate them with every fiber of your being.
p377
aVAnd if I can get you to step into their shoes
p378
aVand walk an inch \u2014 one tiny inch \u2014
p379
aVthen imagine the kind of sociological analysis
p380
aVthat you can do in all other aspects of your life.
p381
aVYou can walk a mile
p382
aVwhen it comes to understanding why that person's driving 40 miles per hour
p383
aVin the passing lane;
p384
aVor your teenage son;
p385
aVor your neighbor who annoys you by cutting his lawn on Sunday mornings.
p386
aVWhatever it is, you can go so far.
p387
aVAnd this is what I tell my students:
p388
aVstep outside of your tiny, little world.
p389
aVStep inside of the tiny, little world of somebody else.
p390
aVAnd then do it again
p391
aVand do it again and do it again.
p392
aVAnd suddenly, all these tiny, little worlds,
p393
aVthey come together in this complex web.
p394
aVAnd they build a big, complex world.
p395
aVAnd suddenly, without realizing it,
p396
aVyou're seeing the world differently.
p397
aVEverything has changed.
p398
aVEverything in your life has changed.
p399
aVAnd that's, of course, what this is about.
p400
aa(lp401
VAttend to other lives,
p402
aVother visions.
p403
aVListen to other people,
p404
aVenlighten ourselves.
p405
aVI'm not saying that I support the terrorists in Iraq.
p406
aVBut as a sociologist, what I am saying is:
p407
aVI understand.
p408
aVAnd now perhaps \u2014 perhaps \u2014 you do, too.
p409
aa(lp410
VThank you.
