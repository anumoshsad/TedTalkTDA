VA hundred years ago this month, a 36-year-old Albert Einstein
p4
aVstood up in front of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin
p5
aVto present a radical new theory of space, time and gravity:
p6
aVthe general theory of relativity.
p7
aa(lp8
VGeneral relativity is unquestionably Einstein's masterpiece,
p9
aVa theory which reveals the workings of the universe at the grandest scales,
p10
aVcapturing in one beautiful line of algebra
p11
aVeverything from why apples fall from trees to the beginning of time and space.
p12
aa(lp13
V1915 must have been an exciting year to be a physicist.
p14
aVTwo new ideas were turning the subject on its head.
p15
aVOne was Einstein's theory of relativity,
p16
aVthe other was arguably even more revolutionary:
p17
aVquantum mechanics,
p18
aVa mind-meltingly strange yet stunningly successful new way
p19
aVof understanding the microworld, the world of atoms and particles.
p20
aa(lp21
VOver the last century, these two ideas have utterly transformed
p22
aVour understanding of the universe.
p23
aVIt's thanks to relativity and quantum mechanics
p24
aVthat we've learned what the universe is made from,
p25
aVhow it began and how it continues to evolve.
p26
aVA hundred years on, we now find ourselves at another turning point in physics,
p27
aVbut what's at stake now is rather different.
p28
aVThe next few years may tell us whether we'll be able
p29
aVto continue to increase our understanding of nature,
p30
aVor whether maybe for the first time in the history of science,
p31
aVwe could be facing questions that we cannot answer,
p32
aVnot because we don't have the brains or technology,
p33
aVbut because the laws of physics themselves forbid it.
p34
aa(lp35
VThis is the essential problem: the universe is far, far too interesting.
p36
aVRelativity and quantum mechanics appear to suggest
p37
aVthat the universe should be a boring place.
p38
aVIt should be dark, lethal and lifeless.
p39
aVBut when we look around us, we see we live in a universe full of interesting stuff,
p40
aVfull of stars, planets, trees, squirrels.
p41
aVThe question is, ultimately,
p42
aVwhy does all this interesting stuff exist?
p43
aVWhy is there something rather than nothing?
p44
aVThis contradiction is the most pressing problem in fundamental physics,
p45
aVand in the next few years, we may find out whether we'll ever be able to solve it.
p46
aa(lp47
VAt the heart of this problem are two numbers,
p48
aVtwo extremely dangerous numbers.
p49
aVThese are properties of the universe that we can measure,
p50
aVand they're extremely dangerous
p51
aVbecause if they were different, even by a tiny bit,
p52
aVthen the universe as we know it would not exist.
p53
aVThe first of these numbers is associated with the discovery that was made
p54
aVa few kilometers from this hall, at CERN, home of this machine,
p55
aVthe largest scientific device ever built by the human race,
p56
aVthe Large Hadron Collider.
p57
aVThe LHC whizzes subatomic particles around a 27-kilometer ring,
p58
aVgetting them closer and closer to the speed of light
p59
aVbefore smashing them into each other inside gigantic particle detectors.
p60
aVOn July 4, 2012, physicists at CERN announced to the world
p61
aVthat they'd spotted a new fundamental particle
p62
aVbeing created at the violent collisions at the LHC: the Higgs boson.
p63
aa(lp64
VNow, if you followed the news at the time,
p65
aVyou'll have seen a lot of physicists getting very excited indeed,
p66
aVand you'd be forgiven for thinking
p67
aVwe get that way every time we discover a new particle.
p68
aVWell, that is kind of true,
p69
aVbut the Higgs boson is particularly special.
p70
aVWe all got so excited because finding the Higgs
p71
aVproves the existence of a cosmic energy field.
p72
aVNow, you may have trouble imagining an energy field,
p73
aVbut we've all experienced one.
p74
aVIf you've ever held a magnet close to a piece of metal
p75
aVand felt a force pulling across that gap,
p76
aVthen you've felt the effect of a field.
p77
aVAnd the Higgs field is a little bit like a magnetic field,
p78
aVexcept it has a constant value everywhere.
p79
aVIt's all around us right now.
p80
aVWe can't see it or touch it,
p81
aVbut if it wasn't there,
p82
aVwe would not exist.
p83
aVThe Higgs field gives mass
p84
aVto the fundamental particles that we're made from.
p85
aVIf it wasn't there, those particles would have no mass,
p86
aVand no atoms could form and there would be no us.
p87
aa(lp88
VBut there is something deeply mysterious about the Higgs field.
p89
aVRelativity and quantum mechanics tell us that it has two natural settings,
p90
aVa bit like a light switch.
p91
aVIt should either be off,
p92
aVso that it has a zero value everywhere in space,
p93
aVor it should be on so it has an absolutely enormous value.
p94
aVIn both of these scenarios, atoms could not exist,
p95
aVand therefore all the other interesting stuff
p96
aVthat we see around us in the universe would not exist.
p97
aVIn reality, the Higgs field is just slightly on,
p98
aVnot zero but 10,000 trillion times weaker than its fully on value,
p99
aVa bit like a light switch that's got stuck just before the off position.
p100
aVAnd this value is crucial.
p101
aVIf it were a tiny bit different,
p102
aVthen there would be no physical structure in the universe.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo this is the first of our dangerous numbers,
p105
aVthe strength of the Higgs field.
p106
aVTheorists have spent decades trying to understand
p107
aVwhy it has this very peculiarly fine-tuned number,
p108
aVand they've come up with a number of possible explanations.
p109
aVThey have sexy-sounding names like "supersymmetry"
p110
aVor "large extra dimensions."
p111
aVI'm not going to go into the details of these ideas now,
p112
aVbut the key point is this:
p113
aVif any of them explained this weirdly fine-tuned value of the Higgs field,
p114
aVthen we should see new particles being created at the LHC
p115
aValong with the Higgs boson.
p116
aVSo far, though, we've not seen any sign of them.
p117
aa(lp118
VBut there's actually an even worse example
p119
aVof this kind of fine-tuning of a dangerous number,
p120
aVand this time it comes from the other end of the scale,
p121
aVfrom studying the universe at vast distances.
p122
aVOne of the most important consequences of Einstein's general theory of relativity
p123
aVwas the discovery that the universe began as a rapid expansion of space and time
p124
aV13.8 billion years ago, the Big Bang.
p125
aVNow, according to early versions of the Big Bang theory,
p126
aVthe universe has been expanding ever since
p127
aVwith gravity gradually putting the brakes on that expansion.
p128
aVBut in 1998, astronomers made the stunning discovery
p129
aVthat the expansion of the universe is actually speeding up.
p130
aVThe universe is getting bigger and bigger faster and faster
p131
aVdriven by a mysterious repulsive force called dark energy.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow, whenever you hear the word "dark" in physics,
p134
aVyou should get very suspicious
p135
aVbecause it probably means we don't know what we're talking about.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VWe don't know what dark energy is,
p140
aVbut the best idea is that it's the energy of empty space itself,
p141
aVthe energy of the vacuum.
p142
aVNow, if you use good old quantum mechanics to work out
p143
aVhow strong dark energy should be,
p144
aVyou get an absolutely astonishing result.
p145
aVYou find that dark energy
p146
aVshould be 10 to the power of 120 times stronger
p147
aVthan the value we observe from astronomy.
p148
aVThat's one with 120 zeroes after it.
p149
aVThis is a number so mind-bogglingly huge
p150
aVthat it's impossible to get your head around.
p151
aVWe often use the word "astronomical" when we're talking about big numbers.
p152
aVWell, even that one won't do here.
p153
aVThis number is bigger than any number in astronomy.
p154
aVIt's a thousand trillion trillion trillion times bigger
p155
aVthan the number of atoms in the entire universe.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo that's a pretty bad prediction.
p158
aVIn fact, it's been called the worst prediction in physics,
p159
aVand this is more than just a theoretical curiosity.
p160
aVIf dark energy were anywhere near this strong,
p161
aVthen the universe would have been torn apart,
p162
aVstars and galaxies could not form, and we would not be here.
p163
aVSo this is the second of those dangerous numbers,
p164
aVthe strength of dark energy,
p165
aVand explaining it requires an even more fantastic level of fine-tuning
p166
aVthan we saw for the Higgs field.
p167
aVBut unlike the Higgs field, this number has no known explanation.
p168
aa(lp169
VThe hope was that a complete combination
p170
aVof Einstein's general theory of relativity,
p171
aVwhich is the theory of the universe at grand scales,
p172
aVwith quantum mechanics, the theory of the universe at small scales,
p173
aVmight provide a solution.
p174
aVEinstein himself spent most of his later years
p175
aVon a futile search for a unified theory of physics,
p176
aVand physicists have kept at it ever since.
p177
aa(lp178
VOne of the most promising candidates for a unified theory is string theory,
p179
aVand the essential idea is,
p180
aVif you could zoom in on the fundamental particles that make up our world,
p181
aVyou'd see actually that they're not particles at all,
p182
aVbut tiny vibrating strings of energy,
p183
aVwith each frequency of vibration corresponding to a different particle,
p184
aVa bit like musical notes on a guitar string.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo it's a rather elegant, almost poetic way of looking at the world,
p187
aVbut it has one catastrophic problem.
p188
aVIt turns out that string theory isn't one theory at all,
p189
aVbut a whole collection of theories.
p190
aVIt's been estimated, in fact,
p191
aVthat there are 10 to the 500 different versions of string theory.
p192
aVEach one would describe a different universe
p193
aVwith different laws of physics.
p194
aVNow, critics say this makes string theory unscientific.
p195
aVYou can't disprove the theory.
p196
aVBut others actually turned this on its head
p197
aVand said, well, maybe this apparent failure
p198
aVis string theory's greatest triumph.
p199
aVWhat if all of these 10 to the 500 different possible universes
p200
aVactually exist out there somewhere
p201
aVin some grand multiverse?
p202
aVSuddenly we can understand
p203
aVthe weirdly fine-tuned values of these two dangerous numbers.
p204
aVIn most of the multiverse,
p205
aVdark energy is so strong that the universe gets torn apart,
p206
aVor the Higgs field is so weak that no atoms can form.
p207
aVWe live in one of the places in the multiverse
p208
aVwhere the two numbers are just right.
p209
aVWe live in a Goldilocks universe.
p210
aa(lp211
VNow, this idea is extremely controversial, and it's easy to see why.
p212
aVIf we follow this line of thinking,
p213
aVthen we will never be able to answer the question,
p214
aV"Why is there something rather than nothing?"
p215
aVIn most of the multiverse, there is nothing,
p216
aVand we live in one of the few places
p217
aVwhere the laws of physics allow there to be something.
p218
aVEven worse, we can't test the idea of the multiverse.
p219
aVWe can't access these other universes,
p220
aVso there's no way of knowing whether they're there or not.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo we're in an extremely frustrating position.
p223
aVThat doesn't mean the multiverse doesn't exist.
p224
aVThere are other planets, other stars, other galaxies,
p225
aVso why not other universes?
p226
aVThe problem is, it's unlikely we'll ever know for sure.
p227
aVNow, the idea of the multiverse has been around for a while,
p228
aVbut in the last few years, we've started to get the first solid hints
p229
aVthat this line of reasoning may get born out.
p230
aVDespite high hopes for the first run of the LHC,
p231
aVwhat we were looking for there \u2014
p232
aVwe were looking for new theories of physics:
p233
aVsupersymmetry or large extra dimensions
p234
aVthat could explain this weirdly fine-tuned value of the Higgs field.
p235
aVBut despite high hopes, the LHC revealed a barren subatomic wilderness
p236
aVpopulated only by a lonely Higgs boson.
p237
aVMy experiment published paper after paper
p238
aVwhere we glumly had to conclude that we saw no signs of new physics.
p239
aa(lp240
VThe stakes now could not be higher.
p241
aVThis summer, the LHC began its second phase of operation
p242
aVwith an energy almost double what we achieved in the first run.
p243
aVWhat particle physicists are all desperately hoping for
p244
aVare signs of new particles, micro black holes,
p245
aVor maybe something totally unexpected
p246
aVemerging from the violent collisions at the Large Hadron Collider.
p247
aVIf so, then we can continue this long journey
p248
aVthat began 100 years ago with Albert Einstein
p249
aVtowards an ever deeper understanding of the laws of nature.
p250
aa(lp251
VBut if, in two or three years' time,
p252
aVwhen the LHC switches off again for a second long shutdown,
p253
aVwe've found nothing but the Higgs boson,
p254
aVthen we may be entering a new era in physics:
p255
aVan era where there are weird features of the universe that we cannot explain;
p256
aVan era where we have hints that we live in a multiverse
p257
aVthat lies frustratingly forever beyond our reach;
p258
aVan era where we will never be able to answer the question,
p259
aV"Why is there something rather than nothing?"
p260
aa(lp261
VThank you.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Applause)
p264
aa(lp265
VBruno Giussani: Harry, even if you just said
p266
aVthe science may not have some answers,
p267
aVI would like to ask you a couple of questions, and the first is:
p268
aVbuilding something like the LHC is a generational project.
p269
aVI just mentioned, introducing you, that we live in a short-term world.
p270
aVHow do you think so long term,
p271
aVprojecting yourself out a generation when building something like this?
p272
aa(lp273
VHarry Cliff: I was very lucky
p274
aVthat I joined the experiment I work on at the LHC in 2008,
p275
aVjust as we were switching on,
p276
aVand there are people in my research group who have been working on it
p277
aVfor three decades, their entire careers on one machine.
p278
aVSo I think the first conversations about the LHC were in 1976,
p279
aVand you start planning the machine without the technology
p280
aVthat you know you're going to need to be able to build it.
p281
aVSo the computing power did not exist in the early '90s
p282
aVwhen design work began in earnest.
p283
aVOne of the big detectors which record these collisions,
p284
aVthey didn't think there was technology
p285
aVthat could withstand the radiation that would be created in the LHC,
p286
aVso there was basically a lump of lead in the middle of this object
p287
aVwith some detectors around the outside,
p288
aVbut subsequently we have developed technology.
p289
aVSo you have to rely on people's ingenuity, that they will solve the problems,
p290
aVbut it may be a decade or more down the line.
p291
aa(lp292
VBG: China just announced two or three weeks ago
p293
aVthat they intend to build
p294
aVa supercollider twice the size of the LHC.
p295
aVI was wondering how you and your colleagues welcome the news.
p296
aa(lp297
VHC: Size isn't everything, Bruno. BG: I'm sure. I'm sure.
p298
aa(lp299
V(Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
VIt sounds funny for a particle physicist to say that.
p302
aVBut I mean, seriously, it's great news.
p303
aVSo building a machine like the LHC
p304
aVrequires countries from all over the world to pool their resources.
p305
aVNo one nation can afford to build a machine this large,
p306
aVapart from maybe China,
p307
aVbecause they can mobilize huge amounts of resources,
p308
aVmanpower and money to build machines like this.
p309
aVSo it's only a good thing.
p310
aVWhat they're really planning to do is to build a machine
p311
aVthat will study the Higgs boson in detail and could give us some clues
p312
aVas to whether these new ideas, like supersymmetry, are really out there,
p313
aVso it's great news for physics, I think.
p314
aa(lp315
VBG: Harry, thank you. HC: Thank you very much.
