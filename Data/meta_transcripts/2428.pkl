(lp3
V15 years ago, I volunteered to participate in a research study
p4
aVthat involved a genetic test.
p5
aVWhen I arrived at the clinic to be tested,
p6
aVI was handed a questionnaire.
p7
aVOne of the very first questions asked me to check a box for my race:
p8
aVWhite, black, Asian, or Native American.
p9
aa(lp10
VI wasn't quite sure how to answer the question.
p11
aVWas it aimed at measuring the diversity
p12
aVof research participants' social backgrounds?
p13
aVIn that case, I would answer with my social identity,
p14
aVand check the box for "black."
p15
aVBut what if the researchers were interested in investigating
p16
aVsome association between ancestry and the risk for certain genetic traits?
p17
aVIn that case, wouldn't they want to know something about my ancestry,
p18
aVwhich is just as much European as African?
p19
aVAnd how could they make scientific findings about my genes
p20
aVif I put down my social identity as a black woman?
p21
aVAfter all, I consider myself a black woman with a white father
p22
aVrather than a white woman with a black mother
p23
aVentirely for social reasons.
p24
aVWhich racial identity I check
p25
aVhas nothing to do with my genes.
p26
aVWell, despite the obvious importance of this question
p27
aVto the study's scientific validity,
p28
aVI was told, "Don't worry about it,
p29
aVjust put down however you identify yourself."
p30
aVSo I check "black,"
p31
aVbut I had no confidence in the results of a study
p32
aVthat treated a critical variable so unscientifically.
p33
aa(lp34
VThat personal experience with the use of race in genetic testing
p35
aVgot me thinking:
p36
aVWhere else in medicine is race used to make false biological predictions?
p37
aa(lp38
VWell, I found out that race runs deeply throughout all of medical practice.
p39
aVIt shapes physicians' diagnoses,
p40
aVmeasurements, treatments,
p41
aVprescriptions,
p42
aVeven the very definition of diseases.
p43
aVAnd the more I found out, the more disturbed I became.
p44
aa(lp45
VSociologists like me have long explained
p46
aVthat race is a social construction.
p47
aVWhen we identify people as black, white, Asian, Native American, Latina,
p48
aVwe're referring to social groupings
p49
aVwith made up demarcations that have changed over time
p50
aVand vary around the world.
p51
aVAs a legal scholar, I've also studied
p52
aVhow lawmakers, not biologists,
p53
aVhave invented the legal definitions of races.
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd it's not just the view of social scientists.
p56
aVYou remember when the map of the human genome
p57
aVwas unveiled at a White House ceremony in June 2000?
p58
aVPresident Bill Clinton famously declared,
p59
aV"I believe one of the great truths
p60
aVto emerge from this triumphant expedition
p61
aVinside the human genome
p62
aVis that in genetic terms,
p63
aVhuman beings, regardless of race,
p64
aVare more than 99.9 percent the same."
p65
aVAnd he might have added
p66
aVthat that less than one percent of genetic difference
p67
aVdoesn't fall into racial boxes.
p68
aa(lp69
VFrancis Collins, who led the Human Genome Project
p70
aVand now heads NIH,
p71
aVechoed President Clinton.
p72
aV"I am happy that today,
p73
aVthe only race we're talking about is the human race."
p74
aa(lp75
VDoctors are supposed to practice evidence-based medicine,
p76
aVand they're increasingly called to join the genomic revolution.
p77
aVBut their habit of treating patients by race lags far behind.
p78
aa(lp79
VTake the estimate
p80
aVof glomerular filtration rate, or GFR.
p81
aVDoctors routinely interpret GFR,
p82
aVthis important indicator of kidney function, by race.
p83
aVAs you can see in this lab test,
p84
aVthe exact same creatinine level,
p85
aVthe concentration in the blood of the patient,
p86
aVautomatically produces a different GFR estimate
p87
aVdepending on whether or not the patient is African-American.
p88
aVWhy?
p89
aa(lp90
VI've been told it's based on an assumption
p91
aVthat African-Americans have more muscle mass
p92
aVthan people of other races.
p93
aVBut what sense does it make
p94
aVfor a doctor to automatically assume
p95
aVI have more muscle mass than that female bodybuilder?
p96
aVWouldn't it be far more accurate and evidence-based
p97
aVto determine the muscle mass of individual patients
p98
aVjust by looking at them?
p99
aa(lp100
VWell, doctors tell me they're using race as a shortcut.
p101
aVIt's a crude but convenient proxy
p102
aVfor more important factors, like muscle mass,
p103
aVenzyme level, genetic traits
p104
aVthey just don't have time to look for.
p105
aVBut race is a bad proxy.
p106
aVIn many cases, race adds no relevant information at all.
p107
aVIt's just a distraction.
p108
aVBut race also tends to overwhelm the clinical measures.
p109
aVIt blinds doctors to patients' symptoms,
p110
aVfamily illnesses,
p111
aVtheir history, their own illnesses they might have \u2014
p112
aVall more evidence-based than the patient's race.
p113
aVRace can't substitute for these important clinical measures
p114
aVwithout sacrificing patient well-being.
p115
aa(lp116
VDoctors also tell me race is just one of many factors
p117
aVthey take into account,
p118
aVbut there are numerous medical tests,
p119
aVlike the GFR,
p120
aVthat use race categorically
p121
aVto treat black, white, Asian patients differently
p122
aVjust because of their race.
p123
aa(lp124
VRace medicine also leaves patients of color especially vulnerable
p125
aVto harmful biases and stereotypes.
p126
aVBlack and Latino patients are twice as likely
p127
aVto receive no pain medication as whites
p128
aVfor the same painful long bone fractures
p129
aVbecause of stereotypes
p130
aVthat black and brown people feel less pain,
p131
aVexaggerate their pain,
p132
aVand are predisposed to drug addiction.
p133
aa(lp134
VThe Food and Drug Administration has even approved a race-specific medicine.
p135
aVIt's a pill called BiDil
p136
aVto treat heart failure in self-identified African-American patients.
p137
aVA cardiologist developed this drug without regard to race or genetics,
p138
aVbut it became convenient
p139
aVfor commercial reasons
p140
aVto market the drug to black patients.
p141
aVThe FDA then allowed
p142
aVthe company, the drug company,
p143
aVto test the efficacy in a clinical trial
p144
aVthat only included African-American subjects.
p145
aVIt speculated
p146
aVthat race stood in as a proxy for some unknown genetic factor
p147
aVthat affects heart disease
p148
aVor response to drugs.
p149
aVBut think about the dangerous message it sent,
p150
aVthat black people's bodies are so substandard,
p151
aVa drug tested in them
p152
aVis not guaranteed to work in other patients.
p153
aa(lp154
VIn the end, the drug company's marketing scheme failed.
p155
aVFor one thing, black patients were understandably wary
p156
aVof using a drug just for black people.
p157
aVOne elderly black woman stood up in a community meeting and shouted,
p158
aV"Give me what the white people are taking!"
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd if you find race-specific medicine surprising,
p163
aVwait until you learn
p164
aVthat many doctors in the United States
p165
aVstill use an updated version
p166
aVof a diagnostic tool
p167
aVthat was developed by a physician during the slavery era,
p168
aVa diagnostic tool that is tightly linked
p169
aVto justifications for slavery.
p170
aa(lp171
VDr. Samuel Cartwright graduated
p172
aVfrom the University of Pennsylvania Medical School.
p173
aVHe practiced in the Deep South before the Civil War,
p174
aVand he was a well-known expert on what was then called "Negro medicine."
p175
aVHe promoted the racial concept of disease,
p176
aVthat people of different races suffer from different diseases
p177
aVand experience common diseases differently.
p178
aVCartwright argued in the 1850s
p179
aVthat slavery was beneficial for black people
p180
aVfor medical reasons.
p181
aVHe claimed that because black people have lower lung capacity than whites,
p182
aVforced labor was good for them.
p183
aVHe wrote in a medical journal,
p184
aV"It is the red vital blood sent to the brain
p185
aVthat liberates their minds when under the white man's control,
p186
aVand it is the want of sufficiency of red vital blood
p187
aVthat chains their minds to ignorance and barbarism when in freedom."
p188
aVTo support this theory, Cartwright helped to perfect
p189
aVa medical device for measuring breathing called the spirometer
p190
aVto show the presumed deficiency in black people's lungs.
p191
aa(lp192
VToday, doctors still uphold Cartwright's claim
p193
aVthe black people as a race
p194
aVhave lower lung capacity than white people.
p195
aVSome even use a modern day spirometer
p196
aVthat actually has a button labeled "race"
p197
aVso the machine adjusts the measurement
p198
aVfor each patient according to his or her race.
p199
aVIt's a well-known function called "correcting for race."
p200
aa(lp201
VThe problem with race medicine extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients.
p202
aVIts focus on innate racial differences in disease
p203
aVdiverts attention and resources
p204
aVfrom the social determinants
p205
aVthat cause appalling racial gaps in health:
p206
aVlack of access to high-quality medical care;
p207
aVfood deserts in poor neighborhoods;
p208
aVexposure to environmental toxins;
p209
aVhigh rates of incarceration;
p210
aVand experiencing the stress of racial discrimination.
p211
aa(lp212
VYou see, race is not a biological category
p213
aVthat naturally produces these health disparities
p214
aVbecause of genetic difference.
p215
aVRace is a social category
p216
aVthat has staggering biological consequences,
p217
aVbut because of the impact of social inequality on people's health.
p218
aVYet race medicine pretends the answer to these gaps in health
p219
aVcan be found in a race-specific pill.
p220
aVIt's much easier and more lucrative
p221
aVto market a technological fix
p222
aVfor these gaps in health
p223
aVthan to deal with the structural inequities that produce them.
p224
aa(lp225
VThe reason I'm so passionate about ending race medicine
p226
aVisn't just because it's bad medicine.
p227
aVI'm also on this mission
p228
aVbecause the way doctors practice medicine
p229
aVcontinues to promote a false and toxic view of humanity.
p230
aVDespite the many visionary breakthroughs in medicine we've been learning about,
p231
aVthere's a failure of imagination
p232
aVwhen it comes to race.
p233
aVWould you imagine with me, just a moment:
p234
aVWhat would happen if doctors stopped treating patients by race?
p235
aVSuppose they rejected
p236
aVan 18th-century classification system
p237
aVand incorporated instead the most advanced knowledge
p238
aVof human genetic diversity and unity,
p239
aVthat human beings cannot be categorized into biological races?
p240
aVWhat if, instead of using race as a crude proxy
p241
aVfor some more important factor,
p242
aVdoctors actually investigated and addressed that more important factor?
p243
aVWhat if doctors joined the forefront
p244
aVof a movement to end the structural inequities
p245
aVcaused by racism,
p246
aVnot by genetic difference?
p247
aa(lp248
VRace medicine is bad medicine,
p249
aVit's poor science
p250
aVand it's a false interpretation of humanity.
p251
aVIt is more urgent than ever
p252
aVto finally abandon this backward legacy
p253
aVand to affirm our common humanity
p254
aVby ending the social inequalities that truly divide us.
p255
