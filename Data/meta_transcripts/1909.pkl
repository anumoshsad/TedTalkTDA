(lp3
VSo when I was in Morocco,
p4
aVin Casablanca, not so long ago,
p5
aVI met a young unmarried mother called Faiza.
p6
aVFaiza showed me photos of her infant son
p7
aVand she told me the story of his conception, pregnancy, and delivery.
p8
aa(lp9
VIt was a remarkable tale,
p10
aVbut Faiza saved the best for last.
p11
aV"You know, I am a virgin," she told me.
p12
aV"I have two medical certificates to prove it."
p13
aa(lp14
VThis is the modern Middle East,
p15
aVwhere two millennia after the coming of Christ,
p16
aVvirgin births are still a fact of life.
p17
aa(lp18
VFaiza's story is just one of hundreds I've heard  over the years, traveling across the Arab region
p19
aVtalking to people about sex.
p20
aVNow, I know this might sound like a dream job,
p21
aVor possibly a highly dubious occupation,
p22
aa(lp23
Vbut for me, it's something else altogether.
p24
aVI'm half Egyptian, and I'm Muslim.
p25
aVBut I grew up in Canada, far from my Arab roots.
p26
aa(lp27
VLike so many who straddle East and West,
p28
aVI've been drawn, over the years, to try to better understand my origins.
p29
aVThat I chose to look at sex comes from  my background in HIV/AIDS,
p30
aVas a writer and a researcher and an activist.
p31
aVSex lies at the heart of an emerging epidemic in the Middle East and North Africa,
p32
aVwhich is one of only two regions in the world where HIV/AIDS is still on the rise.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens
p35
aVwith which to study any society,
p36
aVbecause what happens in our intimate lives
p37
aVis reflected by forces on a bigger stage:
p38
aVin politics and economics, in religion and tradition,  in gender and generations.
p39
aVAs I found, if you really want to know a people,
p40
aVyou start by looking inside their bedrooms.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow to be sure, the Arab world is vast and varied.
p43
aVBut running across it are three red lines \u2014
p44
aVthese are topics you are not supposed  to challenge in word or deed.
p45
aa(lp46
VThe first of these is politics.
p47
aVBut the Arab Spring has changed all that,
p48
aVin uprisings which have blossomed  across the region since 2011.
p49
aVNow while those in power, old and new,
p50
aVcontinue to cling to business as usual,
p51
aVmillions are still pushing back,
p52
aVand pushing forward to what they hope will be a better life.
p53
aa(lp54
VThat second red line is religion.
p55
aVBut now religion and politics are connected,
p56
aVwith the rise of such groups as the  Muslim Brotherhood.
p57
aVAnd some people, at least, are starting  to ask questions
p58
aVabout the role of Islam in public and private life.
p59
aa(lp60
VYou know, as for that third red line,  that off-limits subject,
p61
aVwhat do you think it might be?
p62
aa(lp63
VAudience: Sex.
p64
aa(lp65
VShereen El Feki: Louder, I can't hear you.
p66
aa(lp67
VAudience: Sex.
p68
aa(lp69
VSEF: Again, please don't be shy.
p70
aa(lp71
VAudience: Sex.
p72
aa(lp73
VSEF: Absolutely, that's right, it's sex. (Laughter)
p74
aVAcross the Arab region, the only accepted context for sex is marriage \u2014
p75
aVapproved by your parents, sanctioned by religion
p76
aVand registered by the state.
p77
aVMarriage is your ticket to adulthood.
p78
aVIf you don't tie the knot, you can't  move out of your parents' place,
p79
aVand you're not supposed to be having sex,
p80
aVand you're definitely not supposed  to be having children.
p81
aa(lp82
VIt's a social citadel; it's an impregnable fortress
p83
aVwhich resists any assault, any alternative.
p84
aVAnd around the fortress is this vast field of taboo
p85
aVagainst premarital sex, against condoms,
p86
aVagainst abortion, against homosexuality,
p87
aVyou name it.
p88
aa(lp89
VFaiza was living proof of this.
p90
aVHer virginity statement was  not a piece of wishful thinking.
p91
aVAlthough the major religions of the region extoll premarital chastity,
p92
aVin a patriarchy, boys will be boys.
p93
aVMen have sex before marriage,
p94
aVand people more or less turn a blind eye.
p95
aa(lp96
VNot so for women,
p97
aVwho are expected to be virgins  on their wedding night \u2014
p98
aVthat is, to turn up with your hymen intact.
p99
aVThis is not a question of individual concern,
p100
aVthis is a matter of family honor,  and in particular, men's honor.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd so women and their relatives
p103
aVwill go to great lengths to preserve  this tiny piece of anatomy \u2014
p104
aVfrom female genital mutilation,
p105
aVto virginity testing, to hymen repair surgery.
p106
aa(lp107
VFaiza chose a different route:
p108
aVnon-vaginal sex.
p109
aVOnly she became pregnant all the same.
p110
aVBut Faiza didn't actually realize this,
p111
aVbecause there's so little  sexuality education in schools,
p112
aVand so little communication in the family.
p113
aa(lp114
VWhen her condition became hard to hide,
p115
aVFaiza's mother helped her flee  her father and brothers.
p116
aVThis is because honor killings are a real threat
p117
aVfor untold numbers of women in the Arab region.
p118
aVAnd so when Faiza eventually fetched up at  a hospital in Casablanca,
p119
aVthe man who offered to help her,
p120
aVinstead tried to rape her.
p121
aa(lp122
VSadly, Faiza is not alone.
p123
aVIn Egypt, where my research is focused,
p124
aVI have seen plenty of trouble  in and out of the citadel.
p125
aVThere are legions of young men
p126
aVwho can't afford to get married,
p127
aVbecause marriage has become  a very expensive proposition.
p128
aVThey are expected to bear the burden of costs in married life,
p129
aVbut they can't find jobs.
p130
aVThis is one of the major drivers  of the recent uprisings,
p131
aVand it is one of the reasons for the  rising age of marriage
p132
aVin much of the Arab region.
p133
aa(lp134
VThere are career women who want to get married,
p135
aVbut can't find a husband,
p136
aVbecause they defy gender expectations,
p137
aVor as one young female doctor  in Tunisia put it to me,
p138
aV"The women, they are becoming more and more open.
p139
aVBut the man, he is still at the prehistoric stage."
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd then there are men and women who  cross the heterosexual line,
p142
aVwho have sex with their own sex,
p143
aVor who have a different gender identity.
p144
aVThey are on the receiving end of laws which punish their activities,
p145
aVeven their appearance.
p146
aVAnd they face a daily struggle with social stigma,
p147
aVwith family despair,
p148
aVand with religious fire and brimstone.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow, it's not as if it's all rosy  in the marital bed either.
p151
aVCouples who are looking for greater happiness,
p152
aVgreater sexual happiness in their married lives,
p153
aVbut are at a loss of how to achieve it,
p154
aVespecially wives, who are afraid  of being seen as bad women
p155
aVif they show some spark in the bedroom.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd then there are those whose marriages
p158
aVare actually a veil for prostitution.
p159
aVThey have been sold by their families,
p160
aVoften to wealthy Arab tourists.
p161
aVThis is just one face of a booming  sex trade across the Arab region.
p162
aa(lp163
VNow raise your hand if any of  this is sounding familiar to you,
p164
aVfrom your part of the world.
p165
aVYeah. It's not as if the Arab world has a monopoly on sexual hangups.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd although we don't yet have an Arab Kinsey Report
p168
aVto tell us exactly what's happening  inside bedrooms across the Arab region,
p169
aVIt's pretty clear that  something is not right.
p170
aVDouble standards for men and women,
p171
aVsex as a source of shame,
p172
aVfamily control limiting individual choices,
p173
aVand a vast gulf between appearance and reality:
p174
aVwhat people are doing
p175
aVand what they're willing to admit to,
p176
aVand a general reluctance to move  beyond private whispers
p177
aVto a serious and sustained public discussion.
p178
aa(lp179
VAs one doctor in Cairo summed it up for me,
p180
aV"Here, sex is the opposite of sport.
p181
aVFootball, everybody talks about it,
p182
aVbut hardly anyone plays.
p183
aVBut sex, everybody is doing it,
p184
aVbut nobody wants to talk about it." (Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
V(Music) (In Arabic)
p187
aa(lp188
VSEF: I want to give you a piece of advice,
p189
aVwhich if you follow it, will make you happy in life.
p190
aa(lp191
VWhen your husband reaches out to you,
p192
aVwhen he seizes a part of your body,
p193
aVsigh deeply and look at him lustily.
p194
aa(lp195
VWhen he penetrates you with his penis,
p196
aVtry to talk flirtatiously and  move yourself in harmony with him.
p197
aa(lp198
VHot stuff!
p199
aVAnd it might sound that these handy hints
p200
aVcome from "The Joy of Sex" or YouPorn.
p201
aVBut in fact, they come from a 10th-century Arabic book
p202
aVcalled "The Encyclopedia of Pleasure,"
p203
aVwhich covers sex from aphrodisiacs to zoophilia,
p204
aVand everything in between.
p205
aa(lp206
VThe Encyclopedia is just one  in a long line of Arabic erotica,
p207
aVmuch of it written by religious scholars.
p208
aVGoing right back to the Prophet Muhammad,
p209
aVthere is a rich tradition in Islam
p210
aVof talking frankly about sex:
p211
aVnot just its problems, but also its pleasures,
p212
aVand not just for men, but also for women.
p213
aVA thousand years ago, we used to have  whole dictionaries of sex in Arabic.
p214
aVWords to cover every conceivable sexual feature,
p215
aVposition and preference, a body of language
p216
aVthat was rich enough to make up the body  of the woman you see on this page.
p217
aa(lp218
VToday, this history is largely unknown  in the Arab region.
p219
aVEven by educated people, who often feel more comfortable talking about sex
p220
aVin a foreign language than they do in their own tongue.
p221
aVToday's sexual landscape looks a lot like Europe and America
p222
aVon the brink of the sexual revolution.
p223
aa(lp224
VBut while the West has opened on sex,
p225
aVwhat we found is that Arab societies appear to have been moving in the opposite direction.
p226
aVIn Egypt and many of its neighbors,
p227
aVthis closing down is part of a wider closing
p228
aVin political, social and cultural thought.
p229
aVAnd it is the product of a complex historical process,
p230
aVone which has gained ground with the rise  of Islamic conservatism
p231
aVsince the late 1970s.
p232
aV"Just say no" is what conservatives  around the world
p233
aVsay to any challenge to the sexual status quo.
p234
aVIn the Arab region, they brand these attempts as a Western conspiracy
p235
aVto undermine traditional Arab and Islamic values.
p236
aVBut what's really at stake here
p237
aVis one of their most powerful tools of control:
p238
aVsex wrapped up in religion.
p239
aa(lp240
VBut history shows us that  even as recently
p241
aVas our fathers' and grandfathers' day,
p242
aVthere have been times of greater pragmatism,
p243
aVand tolerance, and a willingness to consider other interpretations:
p244
aVbe it abortion, or masturbation, or even  the incendiary topic of homosexuality.
p245
aVIt is not black and white, as conservatives would have us believe.
p246
aVIn these, as in so many other matters,
p247
aVIslam offers us at least 50 shades of gray.
p248
aV(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
VOver my travels,
p251
aVI've met men and women  across the Arab region
p252
aVwho've been exploring that spectrum \u2014
p253
aVsexologists who are trying to help couples
p254
aVfind greater happiness in their marriages,
p255
aVinnovators who are managing to get  sexuality education into schools,
p256
aVsmall groups of men and women,
p257
aVlesbian, gay, transgendered, transsexual,
p258
aVwho are reaching out to their peers
p259
aVwith online initiatives and real-world support.
p260
aVWomen, and increasingly men, who are starting to speak out
p261
aVand push back against sexual violence
p262
aVon the streets and in the home.
p263
aVGroups that are trying to help sex workers protect themselves against HIV
p264
aVand other occupational hazards,
p265
aVand NGOs that are helping unwed mothers like Faiza
p266
aVfind a place in society, and critically, stay with their kids.
p267
aa(lp268
VNow these efforts are small,  they're often underfunded,
p269
aVand they face formidable opposition.
p270
aVBut I am optimistic that, in the long run,
p271
aVtimes are changing, and they and their ideas
p272
aVwill gain ground.
p273
aVSocial change doesn't happen in the Arab region through dramatic confrontation,
p274
aVbeating or indeed baring of breasts,
p275
aVbut rather through negotiation.
p276
aa(lp277
VWhat we're talking here is not about a  sexual revolution,
p278
aVbut a sexual evolution,  learning from other parts of the world,
p279
aVadapting to local conditions,
p280
aVforging our own path, not following one blazed by another.
p281
aVThat path, I hope, will one day lead us  to the right to control our own bodies,
p282
aVand to access the information  and services we need
p283
aVto lead satisfying and safe sexual lives.
p284
aVThe right to express our ideas freely,
p285
aVto marry whom we choose,  to choose our own partners,
p286
aVto be sexually active or not, to decide whether to have children and when,
p287
aVall this without violence or force or discrimination.
p288
aa(lp289
VNow we are very far from this  across the Arab region,
p290
aVand so much needs to change:
p291
aVlaw, education, media, the economy,
p292
aVthe list goes on and on,
p293
aVand it is the work of a generation, at least.
p294
aa(lp295
VBut it begins with a journey that I myself have made,
p296
aVasking hard questions of received wisdoms
p297
aVin sexual life.
p298
aVAnd it is a journey which has only served to strengthen my faith,
p299
aVand my appreciation of local histories and cultures
p300
aVby showing me possibilities  where I once only saw absolutes.
p301
aa(lp302
VNow given the turmoil in many countries in the Arab region,
p303
aVtalking about sex,  challenging the taboos,
p304
aVseeking alternatives might sound like something of a luxury.
p305
aa(lp306
VBut at this critical moment in history,
p307
aVif we do not anchor freedom and justice,
p308
aVdignity and equality,
p309
aVprivacy and autonomy in our personal lives, in our sexual lives,
p310
aVwe will find it very hard to achieve in public life.
p311
aa(lp312
VThe political and the sexual are intimate bedfellows, and that is true for us all.
p313
aVno matter where we live and love.
p314
aa(lp315
VThank you.
