VStrap yourselves in,
p4
aVwe're going to Mars.
p5
aa(lp6
VNot just a few astronauts \u2014
p7
aVthousands of people are going to colonize Mars.
p8
aVAnd I am telling you that they're going to do this soon.
p9
aVSome of you will end up working on projects on Mars,
p10
aVand I guarantee that some of your children will end up living there.
p11
aa(lp12
VThat probably sounds preposterous,
p13
aVso I'm going to share with you how and when that will happen.
p14
aVBut first I want to discuss the obvious question:
p15
aVWhy the heck should we do this?
p16
aa(lp17
V12 years ago,
p18
aVI gave a TED talk on 10 ways the world could end suddenly.
p19
aVWe are incredibly vulnerable to the whims of our own galaxy.
p20
aVA single, large asteroid could take us out forever.
p21
aVTo survive we have to reach beyond the home planet.
p22
aVThink what a tragedy it would be
p23
aVif all that humans have accomplished were suddenly obliterated.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd there's another reason we should go:
p26
aVexploration is in our DNA.
p27
aVTwo million years ago humans evolved in Africa
p28
aVand then slowly but surely spread out across the entire planet
p29
aVby reaching into the wilderness that was beyond their horizons.
p30
aVThis stuff is inside us.
p31
aVAnd they prospered doing that.
p32
aVSome of the greatest advances in civilization and technology
p33
aVcame because we explored.
p34
aa(lp35
VYes, we could do a lot of good
p36
aVwith the money it will take to establish a thriving colony on Mars.
p37
aVAnd yes we should all be taking far better care of our own home planet.
p38
aVAnd yes, I worry we could screw up Mars the way we've screwed up Earth.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut think for a moment,
p41
aVwhat we had when John F. Kennedy told us we would put a human on the moon.
p42
aVHe excited an entire generation to dream.
p43
aVThink how inspired we will be to see a landing on Mars.
p44
aVPerhaps then we will look back at Earth
p45
aVand see that that is one people instead of many
p46
aVand perhaps then we will look back at Earth,
p47
aVas we struggle to survive on Mars,
p48
aVand realize how precious the home planet is.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo let me tell you about the extraordinary adventure we're about to undertake.
p51
aVBut first,
p52
aVa few fascinating facts about where we're going.
p53
aVThis picture actually represents the true size of Mars compared to Earth.
p54
aVMars is not our sister planet.
p55
aVIt's far less than half the size of the Earth,
p56
aVand yet despite the fact that it's smaller,
p57
aVthe surface area of Mars that you can stand on
p58
aVis equivalent to the surface area of the Earth that you can stand on,
p59
aVbecause the Earth is mostly covered by water.
p60
aa(lp61
VThe atmosphere on Mars is really thin \u2014
p62
aV100 times thinner than on Earth \u2014
p63
aVand it's not breathable, it's 96 percent carbon dioxide.
p64
aa(lp65
VIt's really cold there.
p66
aVThe average temperature is minus 81 degrees,
p67
aValthough there is quite a range of temperature.
p68
aa(lp69
VA day on Mars is about as long as a day on Earth,
p70
aVplus about 39 minutes.
p71
aVSeasons and years on Mars are twice as long as they are on Earth.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd for anybody who wants to strap on some wings and go flying one day,
p74
aVMars has a lot less gravity than on Earth,
p75
aVand it's the kind of place
p76
aVwhere you can jump over your car instead of walk around it.
p77
aa(lp78
VNow, as you can see, Mars isn't exactly Earth-like,
p79
aVbut it's by far the most livable other place in our entire solar system.
p80
aa(lp81
VHere's the problem.
p82
aVMars is a long way away,
p83
aVa thousand times farther away from us than our own moon.
p84
aVThe Moon is 250,000 miles away
p85
aVand it took Apollo astronauts three days to get there.
p86
aVMars is 250 million miles away
p87
aVand it will take us eight months to get there \u2014
p88
aV240 days.
p89
aVAnd that's only if we launch on a very specific day,
p90
aVat a very specific time,
p91
aVonce every two years,
p92
aVwhen Mars and the Earth are aligned just so,
p93
aVso the distance that the rocket would have to travel will be the shortest.
p94
aV240 days is a long time to spend trapped with your colleagues in a tin can.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd meanwhile, our track record of getting to Mars is lousy.
p97
aVWe and the Russians, the Europeans, the Japanese,
p98
aVthe Chinese and the Indians,
p99
aVhave actually sent 44 rockets there,
p100
aVand the vast majority of them have either missed or crashed.
p101
aVOnly about a third of the missions to Mars have been successful.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd we don't at the moment have a rocket big enough to get there anyway.
p104
aVWe once had that rocket, the Saturn V.
p105
aVA couple of Saturn Vs would have gotten us there.
p106
aVIt was the most magnificent machine ever built by humans,
p107
aVand it was the rocket that took us to the Moon.
p108
aVBut the last Saturn V was used in 1973 to launch the Skylab space station,
p109
aVand we decided to do something called the shuttle
p110
aVinstead of continuing on to Mars after we landed on the Moon.
p111
aVThe biggest rocket we have now
p112
aVis only half big enough to get us anything to Mars.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo getting to Mars is not going to be easy
p115
aVand that brings up a really interesting question ...
p116
aVhow soon will the first humans actually land here?
p117
aa(lp118
VNow, some pundits think if we got there by 2050,
p119
aVthat'd be a pretty good achievement.
p120
aa(lp121
VThese days, NASA seems to be saying that it can get humans to Mars by 2040.
p122
aVMaybe they can.
p123
aVI believe that they can get human beings into Mars orbit by 2035.
p124
aVBut frankly,
p125
aVI don't think they're going to bother in 2035 to send a rocket to Mars,
p126
aVbecause we will already be there.
p127
aa(lp128
VWe're going to land on Mars in 2027.
p129
aVAnd the reason is
p130
aVthis man is determined to make that happen.
p131
aVHis name is Elon Musk, he's the CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX.
p132
aVNow, he actually told me that we would land on Mars by 2025,
p133
aVbut Elon Musk is more optimistic than I am \u2014
p134
aVand that's going a ways \u2014
p135
aVso I'm giving him a couple of years of slack.
p136
aVStill ...
p137
aVyou've got to ask yourself,
p138
aVcan this guy really do this by 2025 or 2027?
p139
aa(lp140
VWell, let's put a decade with Elon Musk into a little perspective.
p141
aVWhere was this 10 years ago?
p142
aVThat's the Tesla electric automobile.
p143
aVIn 2005, a lot of people in the automobile industry were saying,
p144
aVwe would not have a decent electric car for 50 years.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd where was that?
p147
aVThat is SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket,
p148
aVlifting six tons of supplies to the International Space Station.
p149
aV10 years ago,
p150
aVSpaceX had not launched anything, or fired a rocket to anywhere.
p151
aVSo I think it's a pretty good bet
p152
aVthat the person who is revolutionizing the automobile industry
p153
aVin less than 10 years
p154
aVand the person who created an entire rocket company in less than 10 years
p155
aVwill get us to Mars by 2027.
p156
aa(lp157
VNow, you need to know this:
p158
aVgovernments and robots no longer control this game.
p159
aVPrivate companies are leaping into space
p160
aVand they will be happy to take you to Mars.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd that raises a really big question.
p163
aVCan we actually live there?
p164
aVNow, NASA may not be able to get us there until 2040,
p165
aVor we may get there a long time before NASA,
p166
aVbut NASA has taken a huge responsibility in figuring out how we can live on Mars.
p167
aa(lp168
VLet's look at the problem this way.
p169
aVHere's what you need to live on Earth:
p170
aVfood, water, shelter and clothing.
p171
aVAnd here's what you need to live on Mars:
p172
aVall of the above, plus oxygen.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo let's look at the most important thing on this list first.
p175
aVWater is the basis of all life as we know it,
p176
aVand it's far too heavy for us to carry water from the Earth to Mars to live,
p177
aVso we have to find water if our life is going to succeed on Mars.
p178
aVAnd if you look at Mars, it looks really dry,
p179
aVit looks like the entire planet is a desert.
p180
aVBut it turns out that it's not.
p181
aVThe soil alone on Mars contains up to 60 percent water.
p182
aVAnd a number of orbiters that we still have flying around Mars have shown us \u2014
p183
aVand by the way, that's a real photograph \u2014
p184
aVthat lots of craters on Mars have a sheet of water ice in them.
p185
aVIt's not a bad place to start a colony.
p186
aa(lp187
VNow, here's a view of a little dig the Phoenix Lander did in 2008,
p188
aVshowing that just below the surface of the soil is ice \u2014
p189
aVthat white stuff is ice.
p190
aVIn the second picture,
p191
aVwhich is four days later than the first picture,
p192
aVyou can see that some of it is evaporating.
p193
aa(lp194
VOrbiters also tell us
p195
aVthat there are huge amounts of underground water on Mars
p196
aVas well as glaciers.
p197
aVIn fact, if only the water ice at the poles on Mars melted,
p198
aVmost of the planet would be under 30 feet of water.
p199
aVSo there's plenty of water there,
p200
aVbut most of it's ice, most of it's underground,
p201
aVit takes a lot of energy to get it and a lot of human labor.
p202
aa(lp203
VThis is a device cooked up at the University of Washington
p204
aVback in 1998.
p205
aVIt's basically a low-tech dehumidifier.
p206
aVAnd it turns out the Mars atmosphere is often 100 percent humid.
p207
aVSo this device can extract all the water that humans will need
p208
aVsimply from the atmosphere on Mars.
p209
aa(lp210
VNext we have to worry about what we will breathe.
p211
aVFrankly, I was really shocked
p212
aVto find out that NASA has this problem worked out.
p213
aVThis is a scientist at MIT named Michael Hecht.
p214
aVAnd he's developed this machine, Moxie.
p215
aVI love this thing.
p216
aVIt's a reverse fuel cell, essentially,
p217
aVthat sucks in the Martian atmosphere and pumps out oxygen.
p218
aVAnd you have to remember that CO2 \u2014
p219
aVcarbon dioxide, which is 96 percent of Mars' atmosphere \u2014
p220
aVCO2 is basically 78 percent oxygen.
p221
aa(lp222
VNow, the next big rover that NASA sends to Mars in 2020
p223
aVis going to have one of these devices aboard,
p224
aVand it will be able to produce enough oxygen
p225
aVto keep one person alive indefinitely.
p226
aVBut the secret to this \u2014
p227
aVand that's just for testing \u2014
p228
aVthe secret to this is that this thing was designed from the get-go
p229
aVto be scalable by a factor of 100.
p230
aa(lp231
VNext, what will we eat?
p232
aVWell, we'll use hydroponics to grow food,
p233
aVbut we're not going to be able to grow
p234
aVmore than 15 to 20 percent of our food there,
p235
aVat least not until water is running on the surface of Mars
p236
aVand we actually have the probability and the capability of planting crops.
p237
aVIn the meantime,
p238
aVmost of our food will arrive from Earth,
p239
aVand it will be dried.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd then we need some shelter.
p242
aVAt first we can use inflatable, pressurized buildings
p243
aVas well as the landers themselves.
p244
aVBut this really only works during the daytime.
p245
aVThere is too much solar radiation and too much radiation from cosmic rays.
p246
aVSo we really have to go underground.
p247
aa(lp248
VNow, it turns out that the soil on Mars,
p249
aVby and large, is perfect for making bricks.
p250
aVAnd NASA has figured this one out, too.
p251
aVThey're going to throw some polymer plastic into the bricks,
p252
aVshove them in a microwave oven,
p253
aVand then you will be able to build buildings with really thick walls.
p254
aVOr we may choose to live underground in caves or in lava tubes,
p255
aVof which there are plenty.
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd finally there's clothing.
p258
aVOn Earth we have miles of atmosphere piled up on us,
p259
aVwhich creates 15 pounds of pressure on our bodies at all times,
p260
aVand we're constantly pushing out against that.
p261
aVOn Mars there's hardly any atmospheric pressure.
p262
aVSo Dava Newman,
p263
aVa scientist at MIT,
p264
aVhas created this sleek space suit.
p265
aVIt will keep us together,
p266
aVblock radiation and keep us warm.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo let's think about this for a minute.
p269
aVFood, shelter, clothing, water, oxygen ...
p270
aVwe can do this.
p271
aVWe really can.
p272
aVBut it's still a little complicated and a little difficult.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo that leads to the next big \u2014
p275
aVreally big step \u2014
p276
aVin living the good life on Mars.
p277
aVAnd that's terraforming the planet:
p278
aVmaking it more like Earth,
p279
aVreengineering an entire planet.
p280
aa(lp281
VThat sounds like a lot of hubris,
p282
aVbut the truth is
p283
aVthat the technology to do everything I'm about to tell you already exists.
p284
aa(lp285
VFirst we've got to warm it up.
p286
aVMars is incredibly cold because it has a very thin atmosphere.
p287
aVThe answer lies here, at the south pole and at the north pole of Mars,
p288
aVboth of which are covered
p289
aVwith an incredible amount of frozen carbon dioxide \u2014
p290
aVdry ice.
p291
aVIf we heat it up,
p292
aVit sublimes directly into the atmosphere
p293
aVand thickens the atmosphere the same way it does on Earth.
p294
aa(lp295
VAnd as we know,
p296
aVCO2 is an incredibly potent greenhouse gas.
p297
aVNow, my favorite way of doing this is to erect a very, very large solar sail
p298
aVand focus it \u2014
p299
aVit essentially serves as a mirror \u2014
p300
aVand focus it on the south pole of Mars at first.
p301
aVAs the planet spins, it will heat up all that dry ice, sublime it,
p302
aVand it will go into the atmosphere.
p303
aVIt actually won't take long
p304
aVfor the temperature on Mars to start rising,
p305
aVprobably less than 20 years.
p306
aa(lp307
VRight now,
p308
aVon a perfect day at the equator,
p309
aVin the middle of summer on Mars,
p310
aVtemperatures can actually reach 70 degrees,
p311
aVbut then they go down to minus 100 at night.
p312
aa(lp313
V(Laughter)
p314
aa(lp315
VWhat we're shooting for is a runaway greenhouse effect:
p316
aVenough temperature rise to see a lot of that ice on Mars \u2014
p317
aVespecially the ice in the ground \u2014 melt.
p318
aVThen we get some real magic.
p319
aa(lp320
VAs the atmosphere gets thicker, everything gets better.
p321
aVWe get more protection from radiation,
p322
aVmore atmosphere makes us warmer, makes the planet warmer,
p323
aVso we get running water
p324
aVand that makes crops possible.
p325
aVThen more water vapor goes into the air, forming yet another potent greenhouse gas.
p326
aVIt will rain and it will snow on Mars.
p327
aVAnd a thicker atmosphere will create enough pressure
p328
aVso that we can throw away those space suits.
p329
aVWe only need about five pounds of pressure to survive.
p330
aVEventually, Mars will be made to feel a lot like British Columbia.
p331
aa(lp332
VWe'll still be left with the complicated problem
p333
aVof making the atmosphere breathable,
p334
aVand frankly that could take 1,000 years to accomplish.
p335
aVBut humans are amazingly smart and incredibly adaptable.
p336
aa(lp337
VThere is no telling what our future technology will be able to accomplish
p338
aVand no telling what we can do with our own bodies.
p339
aVIn biology right now,
p340
aVwe are on the very verge of being able to control our own genetics,
p341
aVwhat the genes in our own bodies are doing,
p342
aVand certainly,
p343
aVeventually, our own evolution.
p344
aVWe could end up with a species of human being on Earth
p345
aVthat is slightly different from the species of human beings on Mars.
p346
aa(lp347
VBut what would you do there? How would you live?
p348
aVIt's going to be the same as it is on Earth.
p349
aVSomebody's going to start a restaurant,
p350
aVsomebody's going to build an iron foundry.
p351
aVSomeone will make documentary movies of Mars
p352
aVand sell them on Earth.
p353
aVSome idiot will start a reality TV show.
p354
aa(lp355
V(Laughter)
p356
aa(lp357
VThere will be software companies,
p358
aVthere will be hotels, there will be bars.
p359
aa(lp360
VThis much is certain:
p361
aVit will be the most disruptive event in our lifetimes,
p362
aVand I think it will be the most inspiring.
p363
aa(lp364
VAsk any 10-year-old girl if she wants to go to Mars.
p365
aVChildren who are now in elementary school are going to choose to live there.
p366
aa(lp367
VRemember when we landed humans on the Moon?
p368
aVWhen that happened, people looked at each other and said,
p369
aV"If we can do this, we can do anything."
p370
aVWhat are they going to think when we actually form a colony on Mars?
p371
aa(lp372
VMost importantly,
p373
aVit will make us a spacefaring species.
p374
aVAnd that means humans will survive no matter what happens on Earth.
p375
aVWe will never be the last of our kind.
p376
aa(lp377
VThank you.
