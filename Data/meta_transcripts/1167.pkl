VFrom all outward appearances,
p4
aVJohn had everything going for him.
p5
aVHe had just signed the contract
p6
aVto sell his New York apartment
p7
aVat a six-figure profit,
p8
aVand he'd only owned it for five years.
p9
aVThe school where he graduated from with his master's
p10
aVhad just offered him a teaching appointment,
p11
aVwhich meant not only a salary,
p12
aVbut benefits for the first time in ages.
p13
aVAnd yet, despite everything going really well for John,
p14
aVhe was struggling,
p15
aVfighting addiction and a gripping depression.
p16
aa(lp17
VOn the night of June 11th, 2003,
p18
aVhe climbed up to the edge
p19
aVof the fence on the Manhattan Bridge
p20
aVand he leaped to the treacherous waters below.
p21
aVRemarkably \u2014
p22
aVno, miraculously \u2014
p23
aVhe lived.
p24
aVThe fall shattered his right arm,
p25
aVbroke every rib that he had,
p26
aVpunctured his lung,
p27
aVand he drifted in and out of consciousness
p28
aVas he drifted down the East River,
p29
aVunder the Brooklyn Bridge
p30
aVand out into the pathway of the Staten Island Ferry,
p31
aVwhere passengers on the ferry
p32
aVheard his cries of pain,
p33
aVcontacted the boat's captain
p34
aVwho contacted the Coast Guard
p35
aVwho fished him out of the East River
p36
aVand took him to Bellevue Hospital.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd that's actually where our story begins.
p39
aVBecause once John committed himself
p40
aVto putting his life back together \u2014
p41
aVfirst physically, then emotionally,
p42
aVand then spiritually \u2014
p43
aVhe found that there were very few resources available
p44
aVto someone who has attempted to end their life
p45
aVin the way that he did.
p46
aa(lp47
VResearch shows
p48
aVthat 19 out of 20 people
p49
aVwho attempt suicide
p50
aVwill fail.
p51
aVBut the people who fail
p52
aVare 37 times more likely to succeed
p53
aVthe second time.
p54
aVThis truly is
p55
aVan at-risk population
p56
aVwith very few resources to support them.
p57
aVAnd what happens
p58
aVwhen people try to assemble themselves back into life,
p59
aVbecause of our taboos around suicide,
p60
aVwe're not sure what to say,
p61
aVand so quite often we say nothing.
p62
aVAnd that furthers the isolation
p63
aVthat people like John found themselves in.
p64
aa(lp65
VI know John's story very well
p66
aVbecause I'm John.
p67
aVAnd this is, today,
p68
aVthe first time in any sort of public setting
p69
aVI've ever acknowledged
p70
aVthe journey that I have been on.
p71
aVBut after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006
p72
aVand a good friend last year to suicide,
p73
aVand sitting last year at TEDActive,
p74
aVI knew that I needed to step out of my silence
p75
aVand past my taboos
p76
aVto talk about an idea worth spreading \u2014
p77
aVand that is that people
p78
aVwho have made the difficult choice
p79
aVto come back to life
p80
aVneed more resources and need our help.
p81
aa(lp82
VAs the Trevor Project says, it gets better.
p83
aVIt gets way better.
p84
aVAnd I'm choosing to come out
p85
aVof a totally different kind of closet today
p86
aVto encourage you, to urge you,
p87
aVthat if you are someone
p88
aVwho has contemplated or attempted suicide,
p89
aVor you know somebody who has,
p90
aVtalk about it; get help.
p91
aVIt's a conversation worth having
p92
aVand an idea worth spreading.
p93
aa(lp94
VThank you.
