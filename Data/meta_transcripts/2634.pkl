VMia Birdsong: Why is Black Lives Matter important for the US right now
p4
aVand in the world?
p5
aa(lp6
VPatrisse Cullors: Black Lives Matter is our call to action.
p7
aVIt is a tool to reimagine a world
p8
aVwhere black people are free to exist,
p9
aVfree to live.
p10
aVIt is a tool for our allies to show up differently for us.
p11
aa(lp12
VI grew up in a neighborhood that was heavily policed.
p13
aVI witnessed my brothers and my siblings
p14
aVcontinuously stopped and frisked by law enforcement.
p15
aVI remember my home being raided.
p16
aVAnd one of my questions as a child was, why?
p17
aVWhy us?
p18
aVBlack Lives Matter offers answers to the why.
p19
aVIt offers a new vision for young black girls around the world
p20
aVthat we deserve to be fought for,
p21
aVthat we deserve to call on local governments to show up for us.
p22
aa(lp23
VOpal Tometi: And antiblack racism \u2014
p24
aa(lp25
V(Applause)
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd antiblack racism is not only happening in the United States.
p28
aVIt's actually happening all across the globe.
p29
aVAnd what we need now more than ever is a human rights movement
p30
aVthat challenges systemic racism in every single context.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Applause)
p33
aa(lp34
VWe need this because the global reality
p35
aVis that black people are subject to all sorts of disparities
p36
aVin most of our most challenging issues of our day.
p37
aVI think about issues like climate change,
p38
aVand how six of the 10 worst impacted nations by climate change
p39
aVare actually on the continent of Africa.
p40
aVPeople are reeling from all sorts of unnatural disasters,
p41
aVdisplacing them from their ancestral homes
p42
aVand leaving them without a chance at making a decent living.
p43
aa(lp44
VWe also see disasters like Hurricane Matthew,
p45
aVwhich recently wreaked havoc in many different nations,
p46
aVbut caused the most damage to Haiti.
p47
aVHaiti is the poorest country in this hemisphere,
p48
aVand its inhabitants are black people.
p49
aVAnd what we're seeing in Haiti
p50
aVis that they were actually facing a number of challenges
p51
aVthat even preceded this hurricane.
p52
aVThey were reeling from the earthquake,
p53
aVthey were reeling from cholera that was brought in by UN peacekeepers
p54
aVand still hasn't been eradicated.
p55
aVThis is unconscionable.
p56
aVAnd this would not happen if this nation didn't have a population that was black,
p57
aVand we have to be real about that.
p58
aa(lp59
VBut what's most heartening right now
p60
aVis that despite these challenges,
p61
aVwhat we're seeing is that there's a network of Africans
p62
aVall across the continent
p63
aVwho are rising up and fighting back and demanding climate justice.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Applause)
p66
aa(lp67
VMB: So Alicia,
p68
aVyou've said that when black people are free,
p69
aVeveryone is free.
p70
aVCan you talk about what that means?
p71
aa(lp72
VAlicia Garza: Sure.
p73
aVSo I think race and racism is probably the most studied
p74
aVsocial, economic and political phenomenon in this country,
p75
aVbut it's also the least understood.
p76
aVThe reality is that race in the United States
p77
aVoperates on a spectrum from black to white.
p78
aVDoesn't mean that people who are in between don't experience racism,
p79
aVbut it means that the closer you are to white on that spectrum,
p80
aVthe better off you are.
p81
aVAnd the closer to black that you are on that spectrum
p82
aVthe worse off your are.
p83
aVWhen we think about how we address problems in this country,
p84
aVwe often start from a place of trickle-down justice.
p85
aVSo using white folks as the control we say,
p86
aVwell, if we make things better for white folks
p87
aVthen everybody else is going to get free.
p88
aVBut actually it doesn't work that way.
p89
aVWe have to address problems at the root,
p90
aVand when you deal with what's happening in black communities,
p91
aVit creates an effervescence, right?
p92
aVSo a bubble up rather than a trickle down.
p93
aVLet me give an example.
p94
aVWhen we talk about the wage gap,
p95
aVwe often say women make 78 cents to every dollar that a man makes.
p96
aVYou all have heard that before.
p97
aVBut those are the statistics for white women and white men.
p98
aVThe reality is that black women make something like 64 cents
p99
aVto every 78 cents that white women make.
p100
aVWhen we talk about latinas, it goes down to about 58 cents.
p101
aVIf we were to talk about indigenous women,
p102
aVif we were to talk about trans women,
p103
aVit would even go further down.
p104
aVSo again,
p105
aVif you deal with those who are the most impacted,
p106
aVeverybody has an opportunity to benefit from that,
p107
aVrather than dealing with the folks who are not as impacted,
p108
aVand expecting it to trickle down.
p109
aa(lp110
VMB: So I love the effervescence,
p111
aVbubbling up.
p112
aa(lp113
VAG: Effervescence \u2014 like champagne.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VMB: Who doesn't love a glass of champagne, right?
p118
aVChampagne and freedom, right?
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VWhat more could we want, y'all?
p123
aa(lp124
VSo you all have been doing this for a minute,
p125
aVand the last few years have been \u2014
p126
aVwell, I can't even imagine,
p127
aVbut I'm sure very transformative.
p128
aVAnd I know that you all have learned a lot about leadership.
p129
aVWhat do you want to share with these people
p130
aVabout what you've learned about leadership?
p131
aVPatrisse, let's start with you.
p132
aa(lp133
VPC: Yeah, we have to invest in black leadership.
p134
aVThat's what I've learned the most in the last few years.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Applause)
p137
aa(lp138
VWhat we've seen is thousands of black people showing up for our lives
p139
aVwith very little infrastructure and very little support.
p140
aVI think our work as movement leaders isn't just about our own visibility
p141
aVbut rather how do we make the whole visible.
p142
aVHow do we not just fight for our individual selves
p143
aVbut fight for everybody?
p144
aVAnd I also think
p145
aVleadership looks like everybody in this audience
p146
aVshowing up for black lives.
p147
aVIt's not just about coming and watching people on a stage, right?
p148
aVIt's about how do you become that leader \u2014
p149
aVwhether it's in your workplace, whether it's in your home \u2014
p150
aVand believe that the movement for black lives isn't just for us,
p151
aVbut it's for everybody.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Applause)
p154
aa(lp155
VMB: What about you, Opal?
p156
aa(lp157
VOT: So I've been learning a great deal about interdependence.
p158
aVI've been learning about how to trust your team.
p159
aVI've come up with this new mantra
p160
aVafter coming back from a three-month sabbatical,
p161
aVwhich is rare for black women to take who are in leadership,
p162
aVbut I felt it was really important for my leadership and for my team
p163
aVto also practice stepping back
p164
aVas well as also sometimes stepping in.
p165
aVAnd what I learned in this process was that we need to acknowledge
p166
aVthat different people contribute different strengths,
p167
aVand that in order for our entire team to flourish,
p168
aVwe have to allow them to share and allow them to shine.
p169
aVAnd so during my sabbatical
p170
aVwith the organization that I also work with,
p171
aVI saw our team rise up in my absence.
p172
aVThey were able to launch new programs,
p173
aVfundraise.
p174
aVAnd when I came back,
p175
aVI had to give them a lot of gratitude and praise
p176
aVbecause they showed me that they truly had my back
p177
aVand that they truly had their own backs.
p178
aa(lp179
VYou know, in this process of my sabbatical,
p180
aVI was really reminded
p181
aVof this Southern African philosophy of Ubuntu.
p182
aVI am because you are;
p183
aVyou are because I am.
p184
aVAnd I realized that my own leadership,
p185
aVand the contributions that I'm able to make,
p186
aVis in large part due to the contributions that they make, right?
p187
aVAnd I have to acknowledge that, and I have to see that,
p188
aVand so my new mantra is, "Keep calm and trust the team."
p189
aVAnd also,
p190
aV"Keep calm and thank the team."
p191
aa(lp192
VMB: You know, one of the things I feel like I've heard
p193
aVin the context of the Black Lives Matter movement more than anywhere else
p194
aVis about being a leaderful movement,
p195
aVand that's such a beautiful concept,
p196
aVand I think that something
p197
aVthat women often bring to the conversation about leadership
p198
aVis really the collective piece.
p199
aVWhat about you, Alicia?
p200
aa(lp201
VAG: Yeah ...
p202
aVHow many of you heard that saying that leadership is lonely?
p203
aVI think that there is an element where leadership is lonely,
p204
aVbut I also believe that it doesn't have to be like that.
p205
aVAnd in order for us to get to that point,
p206
aVI think there's a few things that we need to be doing.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo one is we have to stop treating leaders like superheroes.
p209
aVWe are ordinary people attempting to do extraordinary things,
p210
aVand so we need to be supported in that way.
p211
aa(lp212
VThe other thing that I've learned about leadership
p213
aVis that there's a difference between leadership and celebrities, right?
p214
aVAnd there's a way in which we've been kind of transformed into celebrities
p215
aVrather than people who are trying to solve a problem.
p216
aVAnd the way that we treat celebrities is very fickle, right?
p217
aVWe like them one day,
p218
aVwe don't like what they're wearing the next day,
p219
aVand all of a sudden we have issues, right?
p220
aVSo we need to stop deifying leaders
p221
aVso that more people will step into leadership.
p222
aVLots of people are terrified to step into leadership
p223
aVbecause of how much scrutiny they receive
p224
aVand how brutal we are with leaders.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnd then the last thing that I've learned about leadership
p227
aVis that it's really easy to be a leader when everybody likes you.
p228
aVBut it's hard to be a leader when you have to make hard choices
p229
aVand when you have to do what's right,
p230
aVeven though people are not going to like you for it.
p231
aVAnd so in that way,
p232
aVI think another way that we can support leaders
p233
aVis to struggle with us,
p234
aVbut struggle with us politically,
p235
aVnot personally.
p236
aVWe can have disagreements without being disagreeable,
p237
aVbut it's important for us to sharpen each other,
p238
aVso that we all can rise.
p239
aa(lp240
VMB: That's beautiful, thank you.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Applause)
p243
aa(lp244
VSo you all are doing work
p245
aVthat forces you to face some brutal, painful realities
p246
aVon a daily basis.
p247
aVWhat gives you hope
p248
aVand inspires you in that context?
p249
aa(lp250
VPC: I am hopeful for black futures.
p251
aVAnd I say that because we live in a society
p252
aVthat's so obsessed with black death.
p253
aVWe have images of our death on the TV screen,
p254
aVon our Twitter timelines,
p255
aVon our Facebook timelines,
p256
aVbut what if instead we imagine black life?
p257
aVWe imagine black people living and thriving.
p258
aVAnd that \u2014
p259
aVthat inspires me.
p260
aa(lp261
VOT: What inspires me these days are immigrants.
p262
aVImmigrants all over the world who are doing the best that they can
p263
aVto make a living, to survive and also to thrive.
p264
aVRight now there are over 244 million people
p265
aVwho aren't living in their country of origin.
p266
aVThis is a 40 percent increase since the year 2000.
p267
aVSo what this tells me
p268
aVis that the disparities across the globe are only getting worse.
p269
aVYet there are people who are finding the strength and wherewithal to travel,
p270
aVto move,
p271
aVto eke out a better living for themselves
p272
aVand to provide for their families and their loved ones.
p273
aVAnd some of these people who are immigrants
p274
aVare also undocumented.
p275
aVThey're unauthorized.
p276
aVAnd they inspire me even more
p277
aVbecause although our society is telling them, you're not wanted,
p278
aVyou're not needed here,
p279
aVand they're highly vulnerable and subject to abuse, to wage theft,
p280
aVto exploitation and xenophobic attacks,
p281
aVmany of them are also beginning to organize in their communities.
p282
aVAnd what I'm seeing is that there's also an emerging network
p283
aVof black, undocumented people who are resisting the framework,
p284
aVand resisting the criminalization of their existence.
p285
aVAnd that to me is incredibly powerful
p286
aVand inspires me every singe day.
p287
aa(lp288
VMB: Thank you.
p289
aVAlicia?
p290
aa(lp291
VAG: So we know that young people are the present and the future,
p292
aVbut what inspires me are older people
p293
aVwho are becoming transformed in the service of this movement.
p294
aVWe all know that as you get older,
p295
aVyou get a little more entrenched in your ways.
p296
aVIt's happening to me, I know that's right.
p297
aVBut I'm so inspired when I see people who have a way that they do things,
p298
aVhave a way that they think about the world,
p299
aVand they're courageous enough to be open to listening to what the experiences are
p300
aVof so many of us who want to live in world that's just
p301
aVand want to live in a world that's equitable.
p302
aVAnd I'm also inspired by the actions that I'm seeing older people taking
p303
aVin service of this movement.
p304
aVI'm inspired by seeing older people step into their own power and leadership
p305
aVand say, "I'm not passing a torch,
p306
aVI'm helping you light the fire."
p307
aa(lp308
V(Applause)
p309
aa(lp310
VMB: I love that \u2014
p311
aVyes.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo in terms of action,
p314
aVI think that it is awesome to sit here and be able to listen to you all,
p315
aVand to have our minds open and shift,
p316
aVbut that's not going to get black people free.
p317
aVSo if you had one thing you would like this audience
p318
aVand the folks who are watching around the world to actually do,
p319
aVwhat would that be?
p320
aa(lp321
VAG: OK, two quick ones.
p322
aVOne, call the White House.
p323
aVThe water protectors are being forcibly removed
p324
aVfrom the camp that they have set up to defend what keeps us alive.
p325
aVAnd that is intricately related to black lives.
p326
aVSo definitely call the White House and demand that they stop doing that.
p327
aVThere are tanks
p328
aVand police officers arresting every single person there as we speak.
p329
aa(lp330
V(Applause)
p331
aa(lp332
VThe second thing that you can do
p333
aVis to join something.
p334
aVBe a part of something.
p335
aVThere are groups, collectives \u2014
p336
aVdoesn't have to be a non-profit, you know what I mean?
p337
aVBut there are groups that are doing work in our communities right now
p338
aVto make sure that black lives matter so all lives matter.
p339
aVGet involved;
p340
aVdon't sit on your couch and tell people what you think they should be doing.
p341
aVGo do it with us.
p342
aa(lp343
VMB: Do you guys want to add anything?
p344
aVThat's good? All right. So \u2014
p345
aVAnd I think that the joining something,
p346
aVlike if you feel like there's not something where you are, start it.
p347
aa(lp348
VAG: Start it.
p349
aa(lp350
VMB: These conversations that we're having,
p351
aVhave those conversations with somebody else.
p352
aVAnd then instead of just letting it be a talk that you had,
p353
aVactually decide to start something.
p354
aa(lp355
VOT: That's right.
p356
aa(lp357
VMB: I mean, that's what you all did.
p358
aVYou started something, and look what's happened.
p359
aVThank you all so much for being here with us today.
p360
aa(lp361
VOT: Thank you.
