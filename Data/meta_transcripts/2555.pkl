VThe most complex problems in our time
p4
aVcan be solved with simple techniques,
p5
aVif we are able to dream.
p6
aa(lp7
VAs a child, I discovered that creativity is the key
p8
aVto cross from dreams to reality.
p9
aVI learned this from my grandmother,
p10
aVDr. Ruth Tichauer,
p11
aVa Jewish refugee that settled in the heart of the Andes.
p12
aVThat is how I grew up:
p13
aVencouraged to see beyond any limitation.
p14
aVSo part of my education included helping her
p15
aVin remote, indigenous communities.
p16
aVI cherish those memories,
p17
aVbecause they helped me to understand life outside the city,
p18
aVa life with a lot of possibilities,
p19
aVwithout barriers, as language or culture.
p20
aa(lp21
VDuring those trips, my grandmother used to recite a Kipling poem:
p22
aV"Something hidden. Go and find it.
p23
aVGo and look behind the Mountains.
p24
aVSomething lost behind the mountains.
p25
aVLost and waiting for you. Go!"
p26
aa(lp27
VIn the coming years, I became a medical student.
p28
aVOne of every hundred children born worldwide
p29
aVhas some kind of heart disease.
p30
aVThere's a part of this problem I think I can solve \u2014
p31
aVthe part of this problem I have spent my life working on.
p32
aa(lp33
VThe problem starts
p34
aVduring pregnancy.
p35
aVThe fetus needs to survive inside the mother.
p36
aVSurvival depends on communication
p37
aVbetween the systemic and the pulmonary blood.
p38
aVAt the moment of birth,
p39
aVthis communication needs to stop.
p40
aVIf it doesn't close, the baby has a hole in the heart.
p41
aVIt is caused by prematurity and genetic conditions.
p42
aVBut what we know today
p43
aVis that a lack of oxygen is also one of the causes.
p44
aVAs you can see in the chart,
p45
aVthe frequency of this kind of hole
p46
aVdramatically increases with altitude.
p47
aa(lp48
VVideo: (Baby crying)
p49
aa(lp50
VWhen you look at patients with this condition,
p51
aVthey seem desperate to breathe.
p52
aVTo close the hole, major surgery used to be the only solution.
p53
aa(lp54
VOne night, my friend Malte, were camping in the Amazon region.
p55
aVThe only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avocado branch.
p56
aVThen came a moment of inspiration.
p57
aVSo we used the branch as a mold for our first invention.
p58
aVThe holes in children's hearts can be closed with it.
p59
aVA coil is a piece of wire wrapped onto itself.
p60
aVIt maybe doesn't look so fancy to you now,
p61
aVbut that was our first successful attempt
p62
aVto create a device for this major problem.
p63
aVIn this video, we can see how a very tiny catheter
p64
aVtakes the coil to the heart.
p65
aVThe coil then closes the hole.
p66
aVAfter that moment of inspiration,
p67
aVthere came a very long time of effort
p68
aVdeveloping a prototype.
p69
aVIn vitro and in vivo studies took thousands of hours of work in the lab.
p70
aVThe coil, if it works, can save lives.
p71
aa(lp72
VI returned from Germany to Bolivia,
p73
aVthinking that wherever we go,
p74
aVwe have the opportunity to make a difference.
p75
aVWith my wife and partner, Dr. Alexandra Heath,
p76
aVwe started to see patients.
p77
aVAfter successfully treating patients with our coil,
p78
aVwe felt really enthusiastic.
p79
aVBut we live in a place
p80
aVthat is 12,000 feet high.
p81
aVAnd,
p82
aVthe patients there need a special device to solve their heart condition.
p83
aVThe hole in altitude patients is different,
p84
aVbecause the orifice between the arteries is larger.
p85
aVMost patients cannot afford to be treated on time,
p86
aVand they die.
p87
aVThe first coil could successfully treat
p88
aVonly half of the patients in Bolivia.
p89
aVThe search started again.
p90
aVWe went back to the drawing board.
p91
aa(lp92
VAfter many trials,
p93
aVand with the help of my grandmother's indigenous friends in the mountains,
p94
aVwe obtained a new device.
p95
aVFor centuries, indigenous women told stories by weaving complex patterns
p96
aVon looms,
p97
aVand an unexpected skill helped us for the new device.
p98
aVWe take this traditional method of weaving
p99
aVand make a design made by a smart material
p100
aVthat records shape.
p101
aVIt seems this time,
p102
aVthe weaving allows us to create a seamless device
p103
aVthat doesn't rust
p104
aVbecause it's made of only one piece.
p105
aVIt can change by itself into very complex structures
p106
aVby a procedure that took decades to develop.
p107
aa(lp108
VAs you can see, the device enters the body
p109
aVthrough the natural channels.
p110
aVDoctors have only to close the catheter through the hole.
p111
aVOur device expands, places itself
p112
aVand closes the hole.
p113
aVWe have this beautiful delivery system
p114
aVthat is so simple to use
p115
aVbecause it works by itself.
p116
aVNo open surgery was necessary.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Applause)
p119
aa(lp120
VAs doctors, we fight with diseases
p121
aVthat take a long time and effort to heal \u2014 if they do.
p122
aVThis is the child from before,
p123
aVafter the procedure.
p124
aVAs you can see \u2014
p125
aa(lp126
V(Applause)
p127
aa(lp128
VAs you can see, once the device is in place,
p129
aVthe patient is 100 percent healed.
p130
aVFrom start to finish,
p131
aVthe whole procedure takes only 30 minutes.
p132
aVThat's very rewarding from the medical and human point of view.
p133
aVWe are so proud that some of our former patients
p134
aVare part of our team \u2014
p135
aVa team, thanks to added close interaction
p136
aVwith patients that work with us.
p137
aVTogether, we have only one idea:
p138
aVthe best solutions need to be simple.
p139
aVWe lost the fear of creating something new.
p140
aa(lp141
VThe path, it's not easy.
p142
aVMany obstacles arise all the time.
p143
aVBut we receive strength from our patients.
p144
aVTheir resilience and courage
p145
aVinspire our creativity.
p146
aVOur goal is to make sure
p147
aVthat no child is left behind,
p148
aVnot because of cost or access.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo we have to start a foundation
p151
aVwith a one-to-one model.
p152
aVWe will give one device for free
p153
aVto make sure that every child is treated.
p154
aVWe are in many countries now,
p155
aVbut we need to be everywhere.
p156
aVThis whole thing began
p157
aVwith one impossible idea
p158
aVas will continue it, really:
p159
aVNo child is left behind.
p160
aa(lp161
VMuchas gracias.
