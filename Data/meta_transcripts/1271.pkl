aa(lp9
VNarrator: Many of the tests are conducted
p10
aVwhile Yves is strapped onto the wing,
p11
aVbecause Yves' body is an integral part of the aircraft.
p12
aa(lp13
V[Wind tunnel tests]
p14
aa(lp15
VNarrator: The wing has no steering controls, no flaps, no rudder.
p16
aVYves uses his body to steer the wing.
p17
aa(lp18
VStefan Von Bergen: Well, he turns
p19
aVby just putting his head on one or the other side.
p20
aVAnd sometimes he assists that with his hands,
p21
aVsometimes even with the leg.
p22
aVHe's acting as a human fuselage, so to say.
p23
aVAnd that's quite unique.
p24
aa(lp25
VNarrator: When he arches his back, he gains altitude.
p26
aVWhen he pushes his shoulders forward, he goes into a dive.

aa(lp34
VCommentator One: There he goes.
p35
aVThere is Yves Rossy.
p36
aVAnd I think the wing is open.
p37
aVSo our first critical moment, it's open.
p38
aVHe is down. Is he flying?
p39
aa(lp40
VCommentator Two: It looks like he's stabilized.
p41
aVHe's starting to make his climb.
p42
aa(lp43
VCommentator One: There's that 90 degree turn.
p44
aVHe's out over the channel.
p45
aVThere is Yves Rossy.
p46
aVThere is no turning back now.
p47
aVHe is over the English Channel and under way.
p48
aVLadies and gentlemen,
p49
aVa historic flight has begun.
p50
aa(lp51
V[Images: National Geographic]
p52
aa(lp53
VCommentator Two: And as he approaches the ground,
p54
aVhe's going to pull down on those toggles to flare,
p55
aVslow himself down just a little bit,
p56
aVand then come in for a nice landing.
p57
aa(lp58
VCommentator One: There he is.
p59
aVYves Rossy has landed in England.
p60
aa(lp61
VBruno Giussani: And now he's in Edinburgh. Yves Rossy!
p62
aa(lp63
V(Applause)
p64
aa(lp65
V(Applause ends)
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd his equipment as well.
p68
aVYves, welcome. It is quite amazing.
p69
aVThose sequences were shot over the last three years
p70
aVin various moments of your activities.
p71
aVAnd there were many, many others.
p72
aVSo it's possible to fly almost like a bird.
p73
aVWhat is it like to be up there?
p74
aa(lp75
VYves Rossy: It's fun. It's fun.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VI don't have feathers.
p80
aVBut I feel like a bird sometimes.
p81
aVIt's really an unreal feeling,
p82
aVbecause normally you have a big thing,
p83
aVa plane, around you.
p84
aVAnd when I strap just this little harness,
p85
aVthis little wing,
p86
aVI really have the feeling of being a bird.
p87
aa(lp88
VBG: How did you start to become Jetman?
p89
aa(lp90
VYR: It was about 20 years ago,
p91
aVwhen I discovered free falling.
p92
aVWhen you go out of an airplane, you are almost naked.
p93
aVYou take a position like that.
p94
aVAnd especially when you take a tracking position,
p95
aVyou have the feeling that you are flying.
p96
aVAnd that's the nearest thing to the dream.
p97
aVYou have no machine around you.
p98
aVYou are just in the element.
p99
aVIt's very short and only in one direction.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VSo the idea was, okay,
p104
aVkeep that feeling of freedom,
p105
aVbut change the vector and increase the time.
p106
aa(lp107
VBG: So I'm kind of curious, what's your top speed?
p108
aa(lp109
VYR: It's about 300 km per hour before looping.
p110
aVThat means about 190 miles per hour.
p111
aa(lp112
VBG: What's the weight of the equipment you're carrying?
p113
aa(lp114
VYR: When I exit full of kerosene,
p115
aVI'm about 55 kilos.
p116
aVI have 55 kilos on my back.
p117
aa(lp118
VBG: And you're not piloting?
p119
aVThere is no handle, no steering, nothing?
p120
aVIt is purely your body,
p121
aVand the wings become part of the body and vice versa?
p122
aa(lp123
VYR: That's really the goal,
p124
aVbecause if you put in steering,
p125
aVthen you reinvent the airplane.
p126
aVAnd I wanted to keep this freedom of movement.
p127
aVAnd it's really like the kid playing the airplane.
p128
aVI want to go down like that.
p129
aVAnd up I climb, I turn.
p130
aVIt's really pure flying.
p131
aVIt's not steering, it's flight.
p132
aa(lp133
VBG: What kind of training do you do, you personally, for that?
p134
aa(lp135
VYR: Actually, I try to stay just fit.
p136
aVI don't do special physical training.
p137
aVI just try to keep my mobility through new activities.
p138
aVFor example, last winter I began with kite surfing.
p139
aVSo, new things.
p140
aVSo you have to adapt.
p141
aVI'm quite an experienced manager of systems as a pilot,
p142
aVbut this is, really \u2014
p143
aVYou need fluidity,
p144
aVyou need to be agile
p145
aVand also to adapt really fast.
p146
aa(lp147
VBG: Somebody in the audience asked me,
p148
aV"How does he breathe up there?"
p149
aVBecause you're going fast and you're up at 3,000 meters or so.
p150
aa(lp151
VYR: Okay, up to 3,000 meters,
p152
aVit's not such a big problem with oxygen.
p153
aVBut for example, bikers,
p154
aVthey have the same speed.
p155
aVJust with the helmet, integral helmet,
p156
aVit's really no problem to breathe.
p157
aa(lp158
VBG: Describe for me the equipment, since you have it here.
p159
aVSo Breitling's four engines.
p160
aa(lp161
VYR: Yeah, two-meter span.
p162
aVUltra-stable profile.
p163
aVFour little engines,
p164
aV22 kilos thrust each,
p165
aVturbines, working with kerosene.
p166
aVHarness, parachute.
p167
aVMy only instruments are an altimeter and time.
p168
aVI know I have about eight minutes fuel.
p169
aVSo I just check before it's finished.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd yeah, that's all.
p174
aVTwo parachutes.
p175
aVThat means, if I have a problem with the first one I pull,
p176
aVI still have the possibility to open the second one.
p177
aVAnd this is my life.
p178
aVThat's the real important thing about safety.
p179
aVI did use that during these last 15 years
p180
aVabout 20 times.
p181
aVNever with that type of wing, but at the beginning.
p182
aVI can release my wing
p183
aVwhen I am in a spin or unstable.
p184
aa(lp185
VBG: We saw the 2009 crossing of the Gibraltar Strait
p186
aVwhere you lost control
p187
aVand then you dived down into the clouds
p188
aVand in the ocean.
p189
aVSo that was one of those cases where you let the wings go, right?
p190
aa(lp191
VYR: Yeah. I did try in the clouds,
p192
aVbut you lose orientation completely.
p193
aVSo I did try to take, again,
p194
aVa climb altitude.
p195
aVI thought, okay, I will go out.
p196
aVBut most probably, I did something like that.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VBG: Something that is not very safe, the image.
p201
aa(lp202
VYR: You feel great, but \u2014
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VBut you have not the right altitude.
p207
aVSo the next thing I saw was just blue.
p208
aVIt was the sea.
p209
aVI have also an audible altimeter.
p210
aVSo I was at my minimum altitude
p211
aVin that vector \u2014 fast \u2014
p212
aVso I pulled that.
p213
aVAnd then I did open my chute.
p214
aa(lp215
VBG: So the wings have their own parachute, and you have your two parachutes.
p216
aa(lp217
VYR: Exactly. There is a rescue parachute for the wing
p218
aVfor two reasons:
p219
aVso I can repair it afterward
p220
aVand especially so nobody takes that, just on his head.
p221
aa(lp222
VBG: I see. Maybe come back here.
p223
aVThis is risky stuff indeed.
p224
aVPeople have died trying to do this kind of thing.
p225
aVAnd you don't look like a crazy guy; you're a Swiss airline pilot,
p226
aVso you're rather a checklist kind of guy.
p227
aVI assume you have standards.
p228
aa(lp229
VYR: Yeah. I have no checklist for that.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
VBG: Let's not tell your employer.
p234
aa(lp235
V(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
VYR: No, that's really two worlds.
p238
aVCivil aviation is something that we know very well.
p239
aVWe have a hundred years of experience.
p240
aVAnd you can adapt really precisely.
p241
aVWith that, I have to adapt to something new.
p242
aVThat means improvise.
p243
aVSo it's really a play between these two approaches.
p244
aVSomething that I know very well, these principles.
p245
aVFor example, we have two engines on an Airbus;
p246
aVwith only one engine, you can fly it.
p247
aVSo plan B, always a plan B.
p248
aVIn a fighter, you have an ejection seat.
p249
aVThat's my ejection seat.
p250
aVSo I have the approach of a professional pilot
p251
aVwith the respect of a pioneer
p252
aVin front of Mother Nature.
p253
aa(lp254
VBG: It's well said.
p255
aVWhat happens if one of the engines stops?
p256
aa(lp257
VYR: I do a roll.
p258
aVAnd then I stabilize,
p259
aVand according to my altitude, I continue on two or three engines.
p260
aVIt's sometimes possible.
p261
aVIt's quite complicated to explain,
p262
aVbut according to which regime I was,
p263
aVI can continue on two
p264
aVand try to get a nice place to land, and then I open my parachute.
p265
aa(lp266
VBG: So the beginning of the flight
p267
aVis actually you jump off a plane or a helicopter,
p268
aVand you go on a dive and accelerate the engines,
p269
aVand then you basically take off mid-air somewhere.
p270
aVAnd then the landing, as we have seen,
p271
aVarriving on this side of the Channel,
p272
aVis through a parachute.
p273
aVSo just as a curiosity,
p274
aVwhere did you land when you flew over the Grand Canyon?
p275
aVDid you land on the rim, down at the bottom?
p276
aa(lp277
VYR: It was down on the bottom.
p278
aVAnd I came back afterward on the sled of the helicopter back.
p279
aVBut it was too stony and full of cactus on top.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
VBG: That's exactly why I asked the question.
p284
aa(lp285
VYR: And also, the currents are quite funny there.
p286
aVThere is big thermal activity,
p287
aVbig difference in altitude also.
p288
aVSo it was much safer for me to land at the bottom.
p289
aa(lp290
VBG: I think that right now, many people are asking,
p291
aV"When are you developing a double-seater
p292
aVso they can fly with you?"
p293
aa(lp294
VYR: I have a standard answer.
p295
aVHave you ever seen tandem birds?
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VBG: Perfect answer.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Applause)
p302
aa(lp303
V(Applause ends)
p304
aa(lp305
VBG: Yves, one last question.
p306
aVWhat's next for you? What's next for Jetman?
p307
aa(lp308
VYR: First, to instruct a younger guy.
p309
aVI want to share it, to do formation flights.
p310
aVAnd I plan to start from a cliff,
p311
aVlike catapulted from a cliff.
p312
aa(lp313
VBG: So instead of jumping off a plane, yes?
p314
aa(lp315
VYR: Yes, with the final goal to take off, but with initial speed.
p316
aVReally, I go step by step.
p317
aVIt seems a little bit crazy, but it's not.
p318
aVIt's possible to start already now, it's just too dangerous.
p319
aa(lp320
V(Laughter)
p321
aVThanks to the increasing technology, better technology,
p322
aVit will be safe.
p323
aVAnd I hope it will be for everybody.
p324
aa(lp325
VBG: Yves, thank you very much. Yves Rossy.
