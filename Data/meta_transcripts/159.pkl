VI am very, very happy to be amidst some of the most \u2014
p4
aVthe lights are really disturbing my eyes
p5
aVand they're reflecting on my glasses.
p6
aVI am very happy and honored to be amidst
p7
aVvery, very innovative and intelligent people.
p8
aVI have listened to the three previous speakers,
p9
aVand guess what happened?
p10
aVEvery single thing I planned to say, they have said it here,
p11
aVand it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VBut there is a saying in my culture
p16
aVthat if a bud leaves a tree without saying something,
p17
aVthat bud is a young one.
p18
aVSo, I will \u2014 since I am not young and am very old,
p19
aVI still will say something.
p20
aa(lp21
VWe are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment,
p22
aVbecause another conference is taking place in Berlin.
p23
aVIt is the G8 Summit.
p24
aVThe G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems
p25
aVshould be a massive increase in aid,
p26
aVsomething akin to the Marshall Plan.
p27
aVUnfortunately, I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan.
p28
aVOne, because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated.
p29
aVIts largest recipients were Germany and France,
p30
aVand it was only 2.5 percent of their GDP.
p31
aVAn average African country receives foreign aid
p32
aVto the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP,
p33
aVand that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources
p34
aVfrom rich countries to poor countries.
p35
aa(lp36
VBut I want to say that there are two things we need to connect.
p37
aVHow the media covers Africa in the West, and the consequences of that.
p38
aVBy displaying despair, helplessness and hopelessness,
p39
aVthe media is telling the truth about Africa, and nothing but the truth.
p40
aVHowever, the media is not telling us the whole truth.
p41
aVBecause despair, civil war, hunger and famine,
p42
aValthough they're part and parcel of our African reality,
p43
aVthey are not the only reality.
p44
aVAnd secondly, they are the smallest reality.
p45
aa(lp46
VAfrica has 53 nations.
p47
aVWe have civil wars only in six countries,
p48
aVwhich means that the media are covering only six countries.
p49
aVAfrica has immense opportunities that never navigate
p50
aVthrough the web of despair and helplessness
p51
aVthat the Western media largely presents to its audience.
p52
aVBut the effect of that presentation is, it appeals to sympathy.
p53
aVIt appeals to pity. It appeals to something called charity.
p54
aVAnd, as a consequence, the Western view
p55
aVof Africa's economic dilemma is framed wrongly.
p56
aVThe wrong framing is a product of thinking
p57
aVthat Africa is a place of despair.
p58
aVWhat should we do with it? We should give food to the hungry.
p59
aVWe should deliver medicines to those who are ill.
p60
aVWe should send peacekeeping troops
p61
aVto serve those who are facing a civil war.
p62
aVAnd in the process, Africa has been stripped of self-initiative.
p63
aa(lp64
VI want to say that it is important to recognize
p65
aVthat Africa has fundamental weaknesses.
p66
aVBut equally, it has opportunities and a lot of potential.
p67
aVWe need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa,
p68
aVfrom a challenge of despair,
p69
aVwhich is called poverty reduction,
p70
aVto a challenge of hope.
p71
aVWe frame it as a challenge of hope, and that is worth creation.
p72
aVThe challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa
p73
aVis not the challenge of reducing poverty.
p74
aVIt should be a challenge of creating wealth.
p75
aa(lp76
VOnce we change those two things \u2014
p77
aVif you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction,
p78
aVyou have the international cartel of good intentions
p79
aVmoving onto the continent, with what?
p80
aVMedicines for the poor, food relief for those who are hungry,
p81
aVand peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war.
p82
aVAnd in the process, none of these things really are productive
p83
aVbecause you are treating the symptoms, not the causes
p84
aVof Africa's fundamental problems.
p85
aVSending somebody to school and giving them medicines,
p86
aVladies and gentlemen, does not create wealth for them.
p87
aVWealth is a function of income, and income comes from you finding
p88
aVa profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow, once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa,
p91
aVour second challenge will be,
p92
aVwho are the wealth-creating agents in any society?
p93
aVThey are entrepreneurs. [Unclear] told us they are always
p94
aVabout four percent of the population, but 16 percent are imitators.
p95
aVBut they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship.
p96
aVSo, where should we be putting the money?
p97
aVWe need to put money where it can productively grow.
p98
aVSupport private investment in Africa, both domestic and foreign.
p99
aVSupport research institutions,
p100
aVbecause knowledge is an important part of wealth creation.
p101
aa(lp102
VBut what is the international aid community doing with Africa today?
p103
aVThey are throwing large sums of money for primary health,
p104
aVfor primary education, for food relief.
p105
aVThe entire continent has been turned into
p106
aVa place of despair, in need of charity.
p107
aVLadies and gentlemen, can any one of you tell me
p108
aVa neighbor, a friend, a relative that you know,
p109
aVwho became rich by receiving charity?
p110
aVBy holding the begging bowl and receiving alms?
p111
aVDoes any one of you in the audience have that person?
p112
aVDoes any one of you know a country that developed because of
p113
aVthe generosity and kindness of another?
p114
aVWell, since I'm not seeing the hand,
p115
aVit appears that what I'm stating is true.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Bono: Yes!)
p118
aa(lp119
VAndrew Mwenda: I can see Bono says he knows the country.
p120
aVWhich country is that?
p121
aa(lp122
V(Bono: It's an Irish land.)
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
V(Bono: [unclear])
p127
aa(lp128
VAM: Thank you very much. But let me tell you this.
p129
aVExternal actors can only present to you an opportunity.
p130
aVThe ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage
p131
aVdepends on your internal capacity.
p132
aVAfrica has received many opportunities.
p133
aVMany of them we haven't benefited much.
p134
aVWhy? Because we lack the internal, institutional framework
p135
aVand policy framework that can make it possible for us
p136
aVto benefit from our external relations. I'll give you an example.
p137
aa(lp138
VUnder the Cotonou Agreement,
p139
aVformerly known as the Lome Convention,
p140
aVAfrican countries have been given an opportunity by Europe
p141
aVto export goods, duty-free, to the European Union market.
p142
aVMy own country, Uganda, has a quota to export 50,000 metric tons
p143
aVof sugar to the European Union market.
p144
aVWe haven't exported one kilogram yet.
p145
aVWe import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba.
p146
aVSecondly, under the beef protocol of that agreement,
p147
aVAfrican countries that produce beef
p148
aVhave quotas to export beef duty-free to the European Union market.
p149
aVNone of those countries, including Africa's most successful nation, Botswana,
p150
aVhas ever met its quota.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo, I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa's
p153
aVinability to engage the rest of the world
p154
aVin a more productive relationship
p155
aVis because it has a poor institutional and policy framework.
p156
aVAnd all forms of intervention need support,
p157
aVthe evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth,
p158
aVthe kinds of institutions that increase productivity.
p159
aVHow do we begin to do that, and why is aid the bad instrument?
p160
aVAid is the bad instrument, and do you know why?
p161
aVBecause all governments across the world need money to survive.
p162
aVMoney is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order.
p163
aVYou have to pay the army and the police to show law and order.
p164
aVAnd because many of our governments are quite dictatorial,
p165
aVthey need really to have the army clobber the opposition.
p166
aVThe second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on.
p167
aVWhy should people support their government?
p168
aVWell, because it gives them good, paying jobs,
p169
aVor, in many African countries, unofficial opportunities
p170
aVto profit from corruption.
p171
aa(lp172
VThe fact is no government in the world,
p173
aVwith the exception of a few, like that of Idi Amin,
p174
aVcan seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule.
p175
aVMany countries in the [unclear], they need legitimacy.
p176
aVTo get legitimacy, governments often need to deliver things like primary education,
p177
aVprimary health, roads, build hospitals and clinics.
p178
aVIf the government's fiscal survival
p179
aVdepends on it having to raise money from its own people,
p180
aVsuch a government is driven by self-interest
p181
aVto govern in a more enlightened fashion.
p182
aVIt will sit with those who create wealth.
p183
aVTalk to them about the kind of policies and institutions
p184
aVthat are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business
p185
aVso that it can collect more tax revenues from them.
p186
aVThe problem with the African continent
p187
aVand the problem with the aid industry
p188
aVis that it has distorted the structure of incentives
p189
aVfacing the governments in Africa.
p190
aVThe productive margin in our governments' search for revenue
p191
aVdoes not lie in the domestic economy,
p192
aVit lies with international donors.
p193
aa(lp194
VRather than sit with Ugandan \u2014
p195
aa(lp196
V(Applause) \u2014
p197
aa(lp198
Vrather than sit with Ugandan entrepreneurs,
p199
aVGhanaian businessmen, South African enterprising leaders,
p200
aVour governments find it more productive
p201
aVto talk to the IMF and the World Bank.
p202
aVI can tell you, even if you have ten Ph.Ds.,
p203
aVyou can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry.
p204
aVWhy? Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand
p205
aVthe incentives necessary to expand a business \u2014
p206
aVit requires that you listen to the people, the private sector actors in that industry.
p207
aa(lp208
VGovernments in Africa have therefore been given an opportunity,
p209
aVby the international community, to avoid building
p210
aVproductive arrangements with your own citizens,
p211
aVand therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF
p212
aVand the World Bank, and then it is the IMF and the World Bank
p213
aVthat tell them what its citizens need.
p214
aVIn the process, we, the African people, have been sidelined
p215
aVfrom the policy-making, policy-orientation, and policy-
p216
aVimplementation process in our countries.
p217
aVWe have limited input, because he who pays the piper calls the tune.
p218
aVThe IMF, the World Bank, and the cartel of good intentions in the world
p219
aVhas taken over our rights as citizens,
p220
aVand therefore what our governments are doing, because they depend on aid,
p221
aVis to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens.
p222
aa(lp223
VBut I want to put a caveat on my argument,
p224
aVand that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive.
p225
aVSome aid may have built a hospital, fed a hungry village.
p226
aVIt may have built a road, and that road
p227
aVmay have served a very good role.
p228
aVThe mistake of the international aid industry
p229
aVis to pick these isolated incidents of success,
p230
aVgeneralize them, pour billions and trillions of dollars into them,
p231
aVand then spread them across the whole world,
p232
aVignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village,
p233
aVthe skills, the practices, the norms and habits
p234
aVthat allowed that small aid project to succeed \u2014
p235
aVlike in Sauri village, in Kenya, where Jeffrey Sachs is working \u2014
p236
aVand therefore generalize this experience
p237
aVas the experience of everybody.
p238
aa(lp239
VAid increases the resources available to governments,
p240
aVand that makes working in a government the most profitable thing
p241
aVyou can have, as a person in Africa seeking a career.
p242
aVBy increasing the political attractiveness of the state,
p243
aVespecially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa,
p244
aVaid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions
p245
aVas every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state
p246
aVin order to get access to the foreign aid pie.
p247
aVLadies and gentlemen, the most enterprising people in Africa
p248
aVcannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector
p249
aVbecause the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business.
p250
aVGovernments are not changing it. Why?
p251
aVBecause they don't need to talk to their own citizens.
p252
aVThey talk to international donors.
p253
aVSo, the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government,
p254
aVand that has increased the political tensions in our countries
p255
aVprecisely because we depend on aid.
p256
aa(lp257
VI also want to say that it is important for us to
p258
aVnote that, over the last 50 years, Africa has been receiving increasing aid
p259
aVfrom the international community,
p260
aVin the form of technical assistance, and financial aid,
p261
aVand all other forms of aid.
p262
aVBetween 1960 and 2003, our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid,
p263
aVand we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa.
p264
aVWhere has all the aid gone?
p265
aa(lp266
VI want to use the example of my own country, called Uganda,
p267
aVand the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there.
p268
aVIn the 2006-2007 budget, expected revenue: 2.5 trillion shillings.
p269
aVThe expected foreign aid: 1.9 trillion.
p270
aVUganda's recurrent expenditure \u2014 by recurrent what do I mean?
p271
aVHand-to-mouth is 2.6 trillion.
p272
aVWhy does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent
p273
aVof its own revenue?
p274
aVIt's because there's somebody there called foreign aid, who contributes for it.
p275
aVBut this shows you that the government of Uganda
p276
aVis not committed to spending its own revenue
p277
aVto invest in productive investments,
p278
aVbut rather it devotes this revenue
p279
aVto paying structure of public expenditure.
p280
aVPublic administration, which is largely patronage, takes 690 billion.
p281
aVThe military, 380 billion.
p282
aVAgriculture, which employs 18 percent of our poverty-stricken citizens,
p283
aVtakes only 18 billion.
p284
aVTrade and industry takes 43 billion.
p285
aVAnd let me show you, what does public expenditure \u2014
p286
aVrather, public administration expenditure \u2014 in Uganda constitute?
p287
aVThere you go. 70 cabinet ministers, 114 presidential advisers,
p288
aVby the way, who never see the president, except on television.
p289
aa(lp290
V(Laughter)
p291
aa(lp292
V(Applause)
p293
aa(lp294
VAnd when they see him physically, it is at public functions like this,
p295
aVand even there, it is him who advises them.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VWe have 81 units of local government.
p300
aVEach local government is organized like the central government \u2014
p301
aVa bureaucracy, a cabinet, a parliament,
p302
aVand so many jobs for the political hangers-on.
p303
aVThere were 56, and when our president wanted to
p304
aVamend the constitution and remove term limits,
p305
aVhe had to create 25 new districts, and now there are 81.
p306
aVThree hundred thirty-three members of parliament.
p307
aVYou need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament.
p308
aVOne hundred thirty-four commissions
p309
aVand semi-autonomous government bodies,
p310
aVall of which have directors and the cars. And the final thing,
p311
aVthis is addressed to Mr. Bono. In his work, he may help us on this.
p312
aa(lp313
VA recent government of Uganda study found
p314
aVthat there are 3,000 four-wheel drive motor vehicles
p315
aVat the Minister of Health headquarters.
p316
aVUganda has 961 sub-counties, each of them with a dispensary,
p317
aVnone of which has an ambulance.
p318
aVSo, the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters
p319
aVdrive the ministers, the permanent secretaries, the bureaucrats
p320
aVand the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects,
p321
aVwhile the poor die without ambulances and medicine.
p322
aa(lp323
VFinally, I want to say that before I came to speak here,
p324
aVI was told that the principle of TEDGlobal
p325
aVis that the good speech should be like a miniskirt.
p326
aVIt should be short enough to arouse interest,
p327
aVbut long enough to cover the subject.
p328
aVI hope I have achieved that.
p329
aa(lp330
V(Laughter)
p331
aa(lp332
VThank you very much.
