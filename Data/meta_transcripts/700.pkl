VChris Anderson: Thank you so much, Prime Minister,
p4
aVthat was both fascinating and quite inspiring.
p5
aVSo, you're calling for a global ethic.
p6
aVWould you describe that as global citizenship?
p7
aVIs that an idea that you believe in, and how would you define that?
p8
aa(lp9
VGordon Brown: It is about global citizenship
p10
aVand recognizing our responsibilities to others.
p11
aVThere is so much to do over the next few years
p12
aVthat is obvious to so many of us
p13
aVto build a better world.
p14
aVAnd there is so much shared sense of what we need to do,
p15
aVthat it is vital that we all come together.
p16
aVBut we don't necessarily have the means to do so.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo there are challenges to be met.
p19
aVI believe the concept of global citizenship
p20
aVwill simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents.
p21
aVBut of course the task is to create the institutions
p22
aVthat make that global society work.
p23
aVBut I don't think we should underestimate
p24
aVthe extent to which massive changes in technology
p25
aVmake possible the linking up of people across the world.
p26
aa(lp27
VCA: But people get excited about this idea of global citizenship,
p28
aVbut then they get confused a bit again
p29
aVwhen they start thinking about patriotism,
p30
aVand how to combine these two.
p31
aVI mean, you're elected as Prime Minister
p32
aVwith a brief to bat for Britain.
p33
aVHow do you reconcile the two things?
p34
aa(lp35
VGB: Well, of course national identity remains important.
p36
aVBut it's not at the expense of people accepting their global responsibilities.
p37
aVAnd I think one of the problems of recession
p38
aVis that people become more protectionist,
p39
aVthey look in on themselves,
p40
aVthey try to protect their own nation,
p41
aVperhaps at the expense of other nations.
p42
aVWhen you actually look at the motor of the world economy,
p43
aVit cannot move forward
p44
aVunless there is trade between the different countries.
p45
aVAnd any nation that would become protectionist over the next few years
p46
aVwould deprive itself of the chance of getting the benefits
p47
aVof growth in the world economy.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo, you've got to have a healthy sense of patriotism;
p50
aVthat's absolutely important.
p51
aVBut you've got to realize that this world has changed fundamentally,
p52
aVand the problems we have cannot be solved by one nation and one nation alone.
p53
aa(lp54
VCA: Well, indeed.
p55
aVBut what do you do when the two come into conflict
p56
aVand you're forced to make a decision
p57
aVthat either is in Britain's interest, or the interest of Britons,
p58
aVor citizens elsewhere in the world?
p59
aa(lp60
VGB: Well I think we can persuade people
p61
aVthat what is necessary for Britain's long-term interests,
p62
aVwhat is necessary for America's long-term interests,
p63
aVis proper engagement with the rest of the world,
p64
aVand taking the action that is necessary.
p65
aa(lp66
VThere is a great story, again, told about Richard Nixon.
p67
aV1958, Ghana becomes independent,
p68
aVso it is just over 50 years ago.
p69
aVRichard Nixon goes to represent the United States government
p70
aVat the celebrations for independence in Ghana.
p71
aVAnd it's one of his first outings as Vice President to an African country.
p72
aVHe doesn't quite know what to do,
p73
aVso he starts going around the crowd
p74
aVand starts talking to people
p75
aVand he says to people in this rather unique way,
p76
aV"How does it feel to be free?"
p77
aVAnd he's going around, "How does it feel to be free?"
p78
aV"How does it feel to be free?"
p79
aVAnd then someone says,
p80
aV"How should I know? I come from Alabama."
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd that was the 1950s.
p85
aVNow, what is remarkable
p86
aVis that civil rights in America were achieved in the 1960s.
p87
aVBut what is equally remarkable
p88
aVis socioeconomic rights in Africa have not moved forward very fast
p89
aVeven since the age of colonialism.
p90
aVAnd yet, America and Africa have got a common interest.
p91
aVAnd we have got to realize that if we don't link up
p92
aVwith those people who are sensible voices and democratic voices in Africa,
p93
aVto work together for common causes,
p94
aVthen the danger of Al Qaeda and related groups
p95
aVmaking progress in Africa is very big.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo, I would say that what seems sometimes
p98
aVto be altruism, in relation to Africa, or in relation to developing countries,
p99
aVis more than that.
p100
aVIt is enlightened self-interest for us to work with other countries.
p101
aVAnd I would say that national interest
p102
aVand, if you like, what is the global interest
p103
aVto tackle poverty and climate change
p104
aVdo, in the long run, come together.
p105
aVAnd whatever the short-run price for taking action on climate change
p106
aVor on security, or taking action to provide opportunities
p107
aVfor people for education,
p108
aVthese are prices that are worth paying
p109
aVso that you build a stronger global society
p110
aVwhere people feel able to feel comfortable with each other
p111
aVand are able to communicate with each other in such a way
p112
aVthat you can actually build stronger links between different countries.
p113
aa(lp114
VCA: I still just want to draw out on this issue.
p115
aVSo, you're on vacation at a nice beach,
p116
aVand word comes through that there's been a massive earthquake
p117
aVand that there is a tsunami advancing on the beach.
p118
aVOne end of the beach, there is a house containing a family of five Nigerians.
p119
aVAnd at the other end of the beach there is a single Brit.
p120
aVYou have time to \u2014
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
Vyou have time to alert one house.
p125
aVWhat do you do?
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VGB: Modern communications.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Applause)
p132
aa(lp133
VAlert both.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Applause)
p136
aa(lp137
VI do agree that my responsibility
p138
aVis first of all to make sure that people in our country are safe.
p139
aVAnd I wouldn't like anything that is said today to suggest
p140
aVthat I am diminishing the importance of the responsibility
p141
aVthat each leader has for their own country.
p142
aa(lp143
VBut I'm trying to suggest that there is a huge opportunity
p144
aVopen to us that was never open to us before.
p145
aVBut the power to communicate across borders
p146
aVallows us to organize the world in a different way.
p147
aVAnd I think, look at the tsunami, it's a classic example.
p148
aVWhere was the early warning systems?
p149
aVWhere was the world acting together
p150
aVto deal with the problems that they knew arose
p151
aVfrom the potential for earthquakes,
p152
aVas well as the potential for climate change?
p153
aVAnd when the world starts to work together,
p154
aVwith better early-warning systems,
p155
aVyou can deal with some of these problems in a better way.
p156
aVI just think we're not seeing, at the moment,
p157
aVthe huge opportunities open to us by the ability of people to cooperate
p158
aVin a world where either there was isolationism before
p159
aVor there was limited alliances based on convenience
p160
aVwhich never actually took you to deal with some of the central problems.
p161
aa(lp162
VCA: But I think this is the frustration
p163
aVthat perhaps a lot of people have, like people in the audience here,
p164
aVwhere we love the kind of language that you're talking about.
p165
aVIt is inspiring.
p166
aVA lot of us believe that that has to be the world's future.
p167
aVAnd yet, when the situation changes,
p168
aVyou suddenly hear politicians talking as if,
p169
aVyou know, for example, the life of one American soldier
p170
aVis worth countless numbers of Iraqi civilians.
p171
aVWhen the pedal hits the metal,
p172
aVthe idealism can get moved away.
p173
aVI'm just wondering whether you can see that changing over time,
p174
aVwhether you see in Britain
p175
aVthat there are changing attitudes,
p176
aVand that people are actually more supportive
p177
aVof the kind of global ethic that you talk about.
p178
aa(lp179
VGB: I think every religion, every faith,
p180
aVand I'm not just talking here to people of faith or religion \u2014
p181
aVit has this global ethic at the center of its credo.
p182
aVAnd whether it's Jewish or whether it's Muslim
p183
aVor whether it's Hindu, or whether it's Sikh,
p184
aVthe same global ethic is at the heart of each of these religions.
p185
aVSo, I think you're dealing with something
p186
aVthat people instinctively see as part of their moral sense.
p187
aVSo you're building on something that is not pure self-interest.
p188
aVYou're building on people's ideas and values \u2014
p189
aVthat perhaps they're candles that burn very dimly on certain occasions.
p190
aVBut it is a set of values that cannot, in my view, be extinguished.
p191
aa(lp192
VThen the question is,
p193
aVhow do you make that change happen?
p194
aVHow do you persuade people that it is in their interest
p195
aVto build strong \u2014
p196
aVAfter the Second World War,
p197
aVwe built institutions, the United Nations,
p198
aVthe IMF, the World Bank,
p199
aVthe World Trade Organization, the Marshall Plan.
p200
aVThere was a period in which people talked about an act of creation,
p201
aVbecause these institutions were so new.
p202
aVBut they are now out of date. They don't deal with the problems.
p203
aVYou can't deal with the environmental problem
p204
aVthrough existing institutions.
p205
aVYou can't deal with the security problem in the way that you need to.
p206
aVYou can't deal with the economic and financial problem.
p207
aVSo we have got to rebuild our global institutions,
p208
aVbuild them in a way that is suitable to the challenges of this time.
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd I believe that if you look at the biggest challenge we face,
p211
aVit is to persuade people to have the confidence
p212
aVthat we can build a truly global society
p213
aVwith the institutions that are founded on these rules.
p214
aVSo, I come back to my initial point.
p215
aVSometimes you think things are impossible.
p216
aVNobody would have said 50 years ago
p217
aVthat apartheid would have gone in 1990,
p218
aVor that the Berlin wall would have fallen at the turn of the '80s and '90s,
p219
aVor that polio could be eradicated,
p220
aVor perhaps 60 years ago,
p221
aVnobody would have said a man could gone to the Moon.
p222
aVAll these things have happened.
p223
aVBy tackling the impossible, you make the impossible possible.
p224
aa(lp225
VCA: And we have had a speaker who said that very thing,
p226
aVand swallowed a sword right after that, which was quite dramatic.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VGB: Followed my sword and swallow.
p231
aa(lp232
VCA: But, surely a true global ethic is for someone to say,
p233
aV"I believe that the life of every human on the planet
p234
aVis worth the same, equal consideration,
p235
aVregardless of nationality and religion."
p236
aVAnd you have politicians who have \u2014
p237
aVyou're elected.
p238
aVIn a way, you can't say that.
p239
aVEven if, as a human being, you believe that,
p240
aVyou can't say that.
p241
aVYou're elected for Britain's interests.
p242
aa(lp243
VGB: We have a responsibility to protect.
p244
aVI mean look, 1918, the Treaty of Versailles,
p245
aVand all the treaties before that,
p246
aVthe Treaty of Westphalia and everything else,
p247
aVwere about protecting the sovereign right of countries
p248
aVto do what they want.
p249
aVSince then, the world has moved forward,
p250
aVpartly as a result of what happened with the Holocaust,
p251
aVand people's concern about the rights of individuals
p252
aVwithin territories where they need protection,
p253
aVpartly because of what we saw in Rwanda,
p254
aVpartly because of what we saw in Bosnia.
p255
aVThe idea of the responsibility to protect
p256
aVall individuals who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk
p257
aVis now being established as a principle which governs the world.
p258
aa(lp259
VSo, while I can't automatically say
p260
aVthat Britain will rush to the aid of any citizen of any country, in danger,
p261
aVI can say that Britain is in a position
p262
aVwhere we're working with other countries
p263
aVso that this idea that you have a responsibility
p264
aVto protect people who are victims of either genocide or humanitarian attack,
p265
aVis something that is accepted by the whole world.
p266
aa(lp267
VNow, in the end, that can only be achieved
p268
aVif your international institutions work well enough to be able to do so.
p269
aVAnd that comes back to what the future role of the United Nations,
p270
aVand what it can do, actually is.
p271
aVBut, the responsibility to protect is a new idea that is, in a sense,
p272
aVtaken over from the idea of self-determination
p273
aVas the principle governing the international community.
p274
aa(lp275
VCA: Can you picture, in our lifetimes,
p276
aVa politician ever going out on a platform
p277
aVof the kind of full-form global ethic, global citizenship?
p278
aVAnd basically saying, "I believe that all people across the planet
p279
aVhave equal consideration,
p280
aVand if in power we will act in that way.
p281
aVAnd we believe that the people of this country
p282
aVare also now global citizens and will support that ethic."
p283
aa(lp284
VGB: Is that not what we're doing in the debate about climate change?
p285
aVWe're saying that you cannot solve
p286
aVthe problem of climate change in one country;
p287
aVyou've got to involve all countries.
p288
aVYou're saying that you must, and you have a duty to help those countries
p289
aVthat cannot afford to deal with the problems of climate change themselves.
p290
aVYou're saying you want a deal
p291
aVwith all the different countries of the world
p292
aVwhere we're all bound together
p293
aVto cutting carbon emissions in a way that is to the benefit of the whole world.
p294
aVWe've never had this before because Kyoto didn't work.
p295
aVIf you could get a deal at Copenhagen, where people agreed,
p296
aVA, that there was a long-term target for carbon emission cuts,
p297
aVB, that there was short-range targets that had to be met
p298
aVso this wasn't just abstract;
p299
aVit was people actually making decisions now
p300
aVthat would make a difference now,
p301
aVand if you could then find a financing mechanism
p302
aVthat meant that the poorest countries that had been hurt
p303
aVby our inability to deal with climate change
p304
aVover many, many years and decades
p305
aVare given special help
p306
aVso that they can move to energy-efficient technologies,
p307
aVand they are in a position financially
p308
aVto be able to afford the long-term investment
p309
aVthat is associated with cutting carbon emissions,
p310
aVthen you are treating the world equally,
p311
aVby giving consideration to every part of the planet
p312
aVand the needs they have.
p313
aa(lp314
VIt doesn't mean that everybody does exactly the same thing,
p315
aVbecause we've actually got to do more financially
p316
aVto help the poorest countries,
p317
aVbut it does mean there is equal consideration
p318
aVfor the needs of citizens in a single planet.
p319
aa(lp320
VCA: Yes.
p321
aVAnd then of course the theory is still that those talks get rent apart
p322
aVby different countries fighting over their own individual interests.
p323
aa(lp324
VGB: Yes, but I think Europe has got a position,
p325
aVwhich is 27 countries have already come together.
p326
aVI mean, the great difficulty in Europe
p327
aVis if you're at a meeting and 27 people speak,
p328
aVit takes a very, very long time.
p329
aVBut we did get an agreement on climate change.
p330
aVAmerica has made its first disposition on this
p331
aVwith the bill that President Obama should be congratulated
p332
aVfor getting through Congress.
p333
aVJapan has made an announcement.
p334
aVChina and India have signed up to the scientific evidence.
p335
aVAnd now we've got to move them to accept
p336
aVa long-term target, and then short-term targets.
p337
aVBut more progress has been made, I think, in the last few weeks
p338
aVthan had been made for some years.
p339
aa(lp340
VAnd I do believe that there is a strong possibility
p341
aVthat if we work together, we can get that agreement to Copenhagen.
p342
aVI certainly have been putting forward proposals
p343
aVthat would have allowed the poorest parts of the world
p344
aVto feel that we have taken into account their specific needs.
p345
aVAnd we would help them adapt.
p346
aVAnd we would help them make the transition to a low-carbon economy.
p347
aa(lp348
VI do think a reform of the international institutions is vital to this.
p349
aVWhen the IMF was created in the 1940s,
p350
aVit was created with resources that were five percent or so of the world's GDP.
p351
aVThe IMF now has limited resources, one percent.
p352
aVIt can't really make the difference
p353
aVthat ought to be made in a period of crisis.
p354
aVSo, we've got to rebuild the world institutions.
p355
aVAnd that's a big task:
p356
aVpersuading all the different countries
p357
aVwith the different voting shares in these institutions to do so.
p358
aa(lp359
VThere is a story told about the three world leaders
p360
aVof the day getting a chance to get some advice from God.
p361
aVAnd the story is told that Bill Clinton went to God
p362
aVand he asked when there will be successful climate change
p363
aVand a low-carbon economy.
p364
aVAnd God shook his head and said,
p365
aV"Not this year, not this decade, perhaps not even in [your] lifetime."
p366
aVAnd Bill Clinton walked away in tears
p367
aVbecause he had failed to get what he wanted.
p368
aa(lp369
VAnd then the story is that Barroso, the president of the European Commission,
p370
aVwent to God and he asked,
p371
aV"When will we get a recovery of global growth?"
p372
aVAnd God said, "Not this year, not in this decade,
p373
aVperhaps not in your lifetime."
p374
aVSo Barroso walked away crying and in tears.
p375
aa(lp376
VAnd then the Secretary-General of the United Nations
p377
aVcame up to speak to God and said,
p378
aV"When will our international institutions work?"
p379
aVAnd God cried.
p380
aa(lp381
V(Laughter)
p382
aa(lp383
VIt is very important to recognize that this reform of institutions
p384
aVis the next stage after agreeing upon ourselves
p385
aVthat there is a clear ethic upon which we can build.
p386
aa(lp387
VCA: Prime Minister, I think there are many in the audience
p388
aVwho are truly appreciative of the efforts you made
p389
aVin terms of the financial mess we got ourselves into.
p390
aVAnd there are certainly many people in the audience
p391
aVwho will be cheering you on as you seek to advance this global ethic.
p392
aa(lp393
VThank you so much for coming to TED.
p394
aa(lp395
