VThe story I wanted to share with you today
p4
aVis my challenge as an Iranian artist,
p5
aVas an Iranian woman artist,
p6
aVas an Iranian woman artist
p7
aVliving in exile.
p8
aVWell, it has its pluses and minuses.
p9
aVOn the dark side,
p10
aVpolitics doesn't seem to escape people like me.
p11
aVEvery Iranian artist, in one form or another,
p12
aVis political.
p13
aVPolitics have defined our lives.
p14
aVIf you're living in Iran,
p15
aVyou're facing censorship, harassment,
p16
aVarrest, torture \u2014
p17
aVat times, execution.
p18
aVIf you're living outside like me,
p19
aVyou're faced with life in exile \u2014
p20
aVthe pain of the longing
p21
aVand the separation from your loved ones
p22
aVand your family.
p23
aVTherefore, we don't find
p24
aVthe moral, emotional,
p25
aVpsychological and political space
p26
aVto distance ourselves from the reality
p27
aVof social responsibility.
p28
aa(lp29
VOddly enough,
p30
aVan artist such as myself
p31
aVfinds herself also in the position of being the voice,
p32
aVthe speaker of my people,
p33
aVeven if I have, indeed,
p34
aVno access to my own country.
p35
aVAlso, people like myself,
p36
aVwe're fighting two battles on different grounds.
p37
aVWe're being critical of the West,
p38
aVthe perception of the West
p39
aVabout our identity \u2014
p40
aVabout the image that is constructed about us,
p41
aVabout our women, about our politics,
p42
aVabout our religion.
p43
aVWe are there to take pride
p44
aVand insist on respect.
p45
aVAnd at the same time,
p46
aVwe're fighting another battle.
p47
aVThat is our regime,
p48
aVour government \u2014
p49
aVour atrocious government,
p50
aV[that] has done every crime
p51
aVin order to stay in power.
p52
aVOur artists are at risk.
p53
aVWe are in a position of danger.
p54
aVWe pose a threat
p55
aVto the order of the government.
p56
aa(lp57
VBut ironically,
p58
aVthis situation
p59
aVhas empowered all of us,
p60
aVbecause we are considered, as artists,
p61
aVcentral to the cultural, political,
p62
aVsocial discourse in Iran.
p63
aVWe are there to inspire, to provoke,
p64
aVto mobilize,
p65
aVto bring hope to our people.
p66
aVWe are the reporters of our people,
p67
aVand are communicators
p68
aVto the outside world.
p69
aVArt is our weapon.
p70
aVCulture is a form of resistance.
p71
aVI envy sometimes the artists of the West
p72
aVfor their freedom of expression.
p73
aVFor the fact that they can distance themselves
p74
aVfrom the question of politics.
p75
aVFrom the fact that they are only serving one audience,
p76
aVmainly the Western culture.
p77
aVBut also, I worry about the West,
p78
aVbecause often in this country,
p79
aVin this Western world that we have,
p80
aVculture risks being a form of entertainment.
p81
aVOur people depend on our artists,
p82
aVand culture is beyond communication.
p83
aa(lp84
VMy journey as an artist
p85
aVstarted from a very, very personal place.
p86
aVI did not start
p87
aVto make social commentary
p88
aVabout my country.
p89
aVThe first one that you see in front of you
p90
aVis actually when I first returned to Iran
p91
aVafter being separated for a good 12 years.
p92
aVIt was after the Islamic Revolution
p93
aVof 1979.
p94
aVWhile I was absent from Iran,
p95
aVthe Islamic Revolution had descended on Iran
p96
aVand had entirely transformed the country
p97
aVfrom Persian to the Islamic culture.
p98
aVI came mainly to be reunited with my family
p99
aVand to reconnect in a way
p100
aVthat I found my place in the society.
p101
aVBut instead, I found a country
p102
aVthat was totally ideological
p103
aVand that I didn't recognize anymore.
p104
aVMore so, I became very interested,
p105
aVas I was facing
p106
aVmy own personal dilemmas and questions,
p107
aVI became immersed in the study
p108
aVof the Islamic Revolution \u2014
p109
aVhow, indeed,
p110
aVit had incredibly transformed
p111
aVthe lives of Iranian women.
p112
aVI found the subject of Iranian women
p113
aVimmensely interesting,
p114
aVin the way the women of Iran, historically,
p115
aVseemed to embody the political transformation.
p116
aVSo in a way, by studying a woman,
p117
aVyou can read the structure and the ideology of the country.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo I made a group of work
p120
aVthat at once faced my own personal questions in life,
p121
aVand yet it brought my work into a larger discourse \u2014
p122
aVthe subject of martyrdom,
p123
aVthe question of those who willingly stand in that intersection
p124
aVof love of God, faith,
p125
aVbut violence and crime and cruelty.
p126
aVFor me, this became incredibly important.
p127
aVAnd yet, I had an unusual position toward this.
p128
aVI was an outsider
p129
aVwho had come back to Iran to find my place,
p130
aVbut I was not in a position
p131
aVto be critical of the government
p132
aVor the ideology of the Islamic Revolution.
p133
aVThis changed slowly
p134
aVas I found my voice
p135
aVand I discovered things
p136
aVthat I didn't know I would discover.
p137
aVSo my art became slightly more critical.
p138
aVMy knife became a little sharper.
p139
aVAnd I fell into a life in exile.
p140
aVI am a nomadic artist.
p141
aVI work in Morocco, in Turkey, in Mexico.
p142
aVI go everywhere to make believe it's Iran.
p143
aa(lp144
VNow I am making films.
p145
aVLast year, I finished a film
p146
aVcalled "Women Without Men."
p147
aV"Women Without Men" returns to history,
p148
aVbut another part of our Iranian history.
p149
aVIt goes to 1953
p150
aVwhen American CIA exercised a coup
p151
aVand removed a democratically elected leader,
p152
aVDr. Mossadegh.
p153
aVThe book is written by an Iranian woman,
p154
aVShahrnush Parsipur.
p155
aVIt's a magical realist novel.
p156
aVThis book is banned,
p157
aVand she spent five years in prison.
p158
aVMy obsession with this book,
p159
aVand the reason I made this into a film,
p160
aVis because it at once was addressing
p161
aVthe question of being a female \u2014
p162
aVtraditionally, historically in Iran \u2014
p163
aVand the question of four women
p164
aVwho are all looking for an idea
p165
aVof change, freedom and democracy \u2014
p166
aVwhile the country of Iran, equally, as if another character,
p167
aValso struggled for an idea
p168
aVof freedom and democracy
p169
aVand independence from the foreign interventions.
p170
aa(lp171
VI made this film
p172
aVbecause I felt it's important
p173
aVfor it to speak to the Westerners
p174
aVabout our history as a country.
p175
aVThat all of you seem to remember Iran
p176
aVafter the Islamic Revolution.
p177
aVThat Iran was once a secular society,
p178
aVand we had democracy,
p179
aVand this democracy was stolen from us
p180
aVby the American government,
p181
aVby the British government.
p182
aVThis film also speaks to the Iranian people
p183
aVin asking them to return to their history
p184
aVand look at themselves before they were so Islamicized \u2014
p185
aVin the way we looked, in the way we played music,
p186
aVin the way we had intellectual life.
p187
aVAnd most of all,
p188
aVin the way that we fought for democracy.
p189
aVThese are some of the shots actually from my film.
p190
aVThese are some of the images of the coup.
p191
aVAnd we made this film in Casablanca,
p192
aVrecreating all the shots.
p193
aa(lp194
VThis film tried to find a balance
p195
aVbetween telling a political story,
p196
aVbut also a feminine story.
p197
aVBeing a visual artist, indeed,
p198
aVI am foremost interested to make art \u2014
p199
aVto make art that transcends
p200
aVpolitics, religion,
p201
aVthe question of feminism,
p202
aVand become an important, timeless,
p203
aVuniversal work of art.
p204
aVThe challenge I have
p205
aVis how to do that.
p206
aVHow to tell a political story but an allegorical story.
p207
aVHow to move you with your emotions,
p208
aVbut also make your mind work.
p209
aVThese are some of the images
p210
aVand the characters of the film.
p211
aVNow comes the green movement \u2014
p212
aVthe summer of 2009,
p213
aVas my film is released \u2014
p214
aVthe uprising begins in the streets of Tehran.
p215
aa(lp216
VWhat is unbelievably ironic
p217
aVis the period that we tried to depict in the film,
p218
aVthe cry for democracy
p219
aVand social justice,
p220
aVrepeats itself now
p221
aVagain in Tehran.
p222
aVThe green movement
p223
aVsignificantly inspired the world.
p224
aVIt brought a lot of attention to all those Iranians
p225
aVwho stand for basic human rights
p226
aVand struggle for democracy.
p227
aVWhat was most significant for me
p228
aVwas, once again,
p229
aVthe presence of the women.
p230
aVThey're absolutely inspirational for me.
p231
aVIf in the Islamic Revolution,
p232
aVthe images of the woman portrayed
p233
aVwere submissive
p234
aVand didn't have a voice,
p235
aVnow we saw a new idea of feminism
p236
aVin the streets of Tehran \u2014
p237
aVwomen who were educated,
p238
aVforward thinking, non-traditional,
p239
aVsexually open, fearless
p240
aVand seriously feminist.
p241
aVThese women and those young men
p242
aVunited Iranians
p243
aVacross the world, inside and outside.
p244
aa(lp245
VI then discovered
p246
aVwhy I take so much inspiration
p247
aVfrom Iranian women.
p248
aVThat, under all circumstances,
p249
aVthey have pushed the boundary.
p250
aVThey have confronted the authority.
p251
aVThey have broken every rule
p252
aVin the smallest and the biggest way.
p253
aVAnd once again, they proved themselves.
p254
aVI stand here to say
p255
aVthat Iranian women have found a new voice,
p256
aVand their voice is giving me my voice.
p257
aVAnd it's a great honor
p258
aVto be an Iranian woman and an Iranian artist,
p259
aVeven if I have to operate in the West only for now.
p260
aa(lp261
VThank you so much.
