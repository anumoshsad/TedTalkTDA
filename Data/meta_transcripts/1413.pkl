p6
aVAs a body architect, I fascinate with the human body
p7
aVand explore how I can transform it.

VI worked at Philips Electronics
p10
aVin the far-future design research lab,
p11
aVlooking 20 years into the future.
p12
aVI explored the human skin, and how technology can transform the body.
p13
aVI worked on concepts like an electronic tattoo,
p14
aVwhich is augmented by touch,
p15
aVor dresses that blushed and shivered with light.
p16
aVI started my own experiments.
p17
aVThese were the low-tech approaches to the high-tech conversations I was having.
p18
aVThese are Q-tips stuck to my roommate with wig glue.

VI started a collaboration with a friend of mine, Bart Hess \u2014
p23
aVhe doesn't normally look like this \u2014
p24
aVand we used ourselves as models.
p25
aVWe transformed our apartments into our laboratories,
p26
aVand worked in a very spontaneous and immediate way.
p27
aVWe were creating
p28
aVvisual imagery provoking human evolution.
p29
aa(lp30
VWhilst I was at Philips, we discussed this idea of a maybe technology,
p31
aVsomething that wasn't either switched on or off, but in between.
p32
aVA maybe that could take the form of a gas or a liquid.
p33
aVAnd I became obsessed with this idea of blurring the perimeter of the body,
p34
aVso you couldn't see where the skin ended and the near environment started.
p35
aVI set up my studio in the red-light district
p36
aVand obsessively wrapped myself in plumbing tubing,
p37
aVand found a way to redefine the skin
p38
aVand create this dynamic textile.
p39
aVI was introduced to Robyn, the Swedish pop star,
p40
aVand she was also exploring
p41
aVhow technology coexists with raw human emotion.
p42
aVAnd she talked about how technology with these new feathers,
p43
aVthis new face paint, this punk, the way that we identify with the world,
p44
aVand we made this music video.
p45
aa(lp46
VI'm fascinated with the idea
p47
aVof what happens when you merge biology with technology,
p48
aVand I remember reading about this idea of being able to reprogram
p49
aVbiology, in the future, away from disease and aging.
p50
aVAnd I thought about this concept of,
p51
aVimagine if we could reprogram
p52
aVour own body odor, modify and biologically enhance it,
p53
aVand how would that change the way that we communicate with each other?
p54
aVOr the way that we attract sexual partners?
p55
aVAnd would we revert back to being more like animals,
p56
aVmore primal modes of communication?
p57
aVI worked with a synthetic biologist,
p58
aVand I created a swallowable perfume,
p59
aVwhich is a cosmetic pill that you eat
p60
aVand the fragrance comes out through the skin's surface when you perspire.
p61
aVIt completely blows apart the way that perfume is,
p62
aVand provides a whole new format.
p63
aVIt's perfume coming from the inside out.
p64
aVIt redefines the role of skin, and our bodies become an atomizer.
p65
aa(lp66
VI've learned that there's no boundaries,
p67
aVand if I look at the evolution of my work
p68
aVi can see threads and connections that make sense.
p69
aVBut when I look towards the future,
p70
aVthe next project is completely unknown and wide open.
p71
aVI feel like I have all these ideas existing embedded inside of me,
p72
aVand it's these conversations and these experiences
p73
aVthat connect these ideas, and they kind of instinctively come out.
p74
aa(lp75
VAs a body architect,
p76
aVI've created this limitless and boundless platform
p77
aVfor me to discover whatever I want.
p78
aVAnd I feel like I've just got started.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo here's to another day at the office.
