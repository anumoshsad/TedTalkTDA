VHi. So I'd like to talk a little bit about the people
p4
aVwho make the things we use every day:
p5
aVour shoes, our handbags, our computers and cell phones.
p6
aVNow, this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt.
p7
aVImagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than
p8
aVa dollar an hour stitching your running shoes,
p9
aVor the young Chinese man who jumps off a rooftop
p10
aVafter working overtime assembling your iPad.
p11
aVWe, the beneficiaries of globalization, seem to exploit
p12
aVthese victims with every purchase we make,
p13
aVand the injustice
p14
aVfeels embedded in the products themselves.
p15
aVAfter all, what's wrong with a world in which a worker
p16
aVon an iPhone assembly line can't even afford to buy one?
p17
aVIt's taken for granted that Chinese factories are oppressive,
p18
aVand that it's our desire for cheap goods
p19
aVthat makes them so.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo, this simple narrative equating Western demand
p22
aVand Chinese suffering is appealing,
p23
aVespecially at a time when many of us already feel guilty
p24
aVabout our impact on the world,
p25
aVbut it's also inaccurate and disrespectful.
p26
aVWe must be peculiarly self-obsessed to imagine that we
p27
aVhave the power to drive tens of millions of people
p28
aVon the other side of the world to migrate and suffer
p29
aVin such terrible ways.
p30
aVIn fact, China makes goods for markets all over the world,
p31
aVincluding its own, thanks to a combination of factors:
p32
aVits low costs, its large and educated workforce,
p33
aVand a flexible manufacturing system
p34
aVthat responds quickly to market demands.
p35
aVBy focusing so much on ourselves and our gadgets,
p36
aVwe have rendered the individuals on the other end
p37
aVinto invisibility, as tiny and interchangeable
p38
aVas the parts of a mobile phone.
p39
aa(lp40
VChinese workers are not forced into factories
p41
aVbecause of our insatiable desire for iPods.
p42
aVThey choose to leave their homes in order to earn money,
p43
aVto learn new skills, and to see the world.
p44
aVIn the ongoing debate about globalization, what's
p45
aVbeen missing is the voices of the workers themselves.
p46
aa(lp47
VHere are a few.
p48
aa(lp49
VBao Yongxiu: "My mother tells me to come home
p50
aVand get married, but if I marry now, before I have fully
p51
aVdeveloped myself, I can only marry an ordinary worker,
p52
aVso I'm not in a rush."
p53
aa(lp54
VChen Ying: "When I went home for the new year,
p55
aVeveryone said I had changed. They asked me,
p56
aVwhat did you do that you have changed so much?
p57
aVI told them that I studied and worked hard. If you tell them
p58
aVmore, they won't understand anyway."
p59
aa(lp60
VWu Chunming: "Even if I make a lot of money,
p61
aVit won't satisfy me.
p62
aVJust to make money is not enough meaning in life."
p63
aa(lp64
VXiao Jin: "Now, after I get off work, I study English,
p65
aVbecause in the future, our customers won't
p66
aVbe only Chinese, so we must learn more languages."
p67
aa(lp68
VAll of these speakers, by the way, are young women,
p69
aV18 or 19 years old.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers
p72
aVlike these in the south China factory city called Dongguan.
p73
aVCertain subjects came up over and over:
p74
aVhow much money they made,
p75
aVwhat kind of husband they hoped to marry,
p76
aVwhether they should jump to another factory
p77
aVor stay where they were.
p78
aVOther subjects came up almost never, including
p79
aVliving conditions that to me looked close to prison life:
p80
aV10 or 15 workers in one room,
p81
aV50 people sharing a single bathroom,
p82
aVdays and nights ruled by the factory clock.
p83
aVEveryone they knew lived in similar circumstances,
p84
aVand it was still better than the dormitories and homes
p85
aVof rural China.
p86
aa(lp87
VThe workers rarely spoke about the products they made,
p88
aVand they often had great difficulty explaining
p89
aVwhat exactly they did.
p90
aVWhen I asked Lu Qingmin,
p91
aVthe young woman I got to know best,
p92
aVwhat exactly she did on the factory floor,
p93
aVshe said something to me in Chinese that sounded like
p94
aV"qiu xi."
p95
aVOnly much later did I realize that she had been saying
p96
aV"QC," or quality control.
p97
aVShe couldn't even tell me what she did on the factory floor.
p98
aVAll she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation
p99
aVin a language she didn't even understand.
p100
aa(lp101
VKarl Marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism,
p102
aVthe alienation of the worker from the product of his labor.
p103
aVUnlike, say, a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets,
p104
aVthe worker in an industrial factory has no control,
p105
aVno pleasure, and no true satisfaction or understanding
p106
aVin her own work.
p107
aVBut like so many theories that Marx arrived at
p108
aVsitting in the reading room of the British Museum,
p109
aVhe got this one wrong.
p110
aVJust because a person spends her time
p111
aVmaking a piece of something does not mean
p112
aVthat she becomes that, a piece of something.
p113
aVWhat she does with the money she earns,
p114
aVwhat she learns in that place, and how it changes her,
p115
aVthese are the things that matter.
p116
aVWhat a factory makes is never the point, and
p117
aVthe workers could not care less who buys their products.
p118
aa(lp119
VJournalistic coverage of Chinese factories,
p120
aVon the other hand, plays up this relationship
p121
aVbetween the workers and the products they make.
p122
aVMany articles calculate: How long would it take
p123
aVfor this worker to work in order to earn enough money
p124
aVto buy what he's making?
p125
aVFor example, an entry-level-line assembly line worker
p126
aVin China in an iPhone plant would have to shell out
p127
aVtwo and a half months' wages for an iPhone.
p128
aa(lp129
VBut how meaningful is this calculation, really?
p130
aVFor example, I recently wrote an article
p131
aVin The New Yorker magazine,
p132
aVbut I can't afford to buy an ad in it.
p133
aVBut, who cares? I don't want an ad in The New Yorker,
p134
aVand most of these workers don't really want iPhones.
p135
aVTheir calculations are different.
p136
aVHow long should I stay in this factory?
p137
aVHow much money can I save?
p138
aVHow much will it take to buy an apartment or a car,
p139
aVto get married, or to put my child through school?
p140
aa(lp141
VThe workers I got to know had a curiously abstract
p142
aVrelationship with the product of their labor.
p143
aVAbout a year after I met Lu Qingmin, or Min,
p144
aVshe invited me home to her family village
p145
aVfor the Chinese New Year.
p146
aVOn the train home, she gave me a present:
p147
aVa Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim.
p148
aVI thanked her, assuming it was fake,
p149
aVlike almost everything else for sale in Dongguan.
p150
aVAfter we got home, Min gave her mother another present:
p151
aVa pink Dooney & Bourke handbag,
p152
aVand a few nights later, her sister was showing off
p153
aVa maroon LeSportsac shoulder bag.
p154
aVSlowly it was dawning on me that these handbags
p155
aVwere made by their factory,
p156
aVand every single one of them was authentic.
p157
aa(lp158
VMin's sister said to her parents,
p159
aV"In America, this bag sells for 320 dollars."
p160
aVHer parents, who are both farmers, looked on, speechless.
p161
aV"And that's not all \u2014 Coach is coming out with a new line,
p162
aV2191," she said. "One bag will sell for 6,000."
p163
aVShe paused and said, "I don't know if that's 6,000 yuan or
p164
aV6,000 American dollars, but anyway, it's 6,000." (Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VMin's sister's boyfriend, who had traveled home with her
p167
aVfor the new year, said,
p168
aV"It doesn't look like it's worth that much."
p169
aa(lp170
VMin's sister turned to him and said, "Some people actually
p171
aVunderstand these things. You don't understand shit."
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p174
aa(lp175
VIn Min's world, the Coach bags had a curious currency.
p176
aVThey weren't exactly worthless, but they were nothing
p177
aVclose to the actual value, because almost no one they knew
p178
aVwanted to buy one, or knew how much it was worth.
p179
aVOnce, when Min's older sister's friend got married,
p180
aVshe brought a handbag along as a wedding present.
p181
aVAnother time, after Min had already left
p182
aVthe handbag factory, her younger sister came to visit,
p183
aVbringing two Coach Signature handbags as gifts.
p184
aa(lp185
VI looked in the zippered pocket of one,
p186
aVand I found a printed card in English, which read,
p187
aV"An American classic.
p188
aVIn 1941, the burnished patina
p189
aVof an all-American baseball glove
p190
aVinspired the founder of Coach to create
p191
aVa new collection of handbags from the same
p192
aVluxuriously soft gloved-hand leather.
p193
aVSix skilled leatherworkers crafted 12 Signature handbags
p194
aVwith perfect proportions and a timeless flair.
p195
aVThey were fresh, functional, and women everywhere
p196
aVadored them. A new American classic was born."
p197
aa(lp198
VI wonder what Karl Marx would have made of Min
p199
aVand her sisters.
p200
aVTheir relationship with the product of their labor
p201
aVwas more complicated, surprising and funny
p202
aVthan he could have imagined.
p203
aVAnd yet, his view of the world persists, and our tendency
p204
aVto see the workers as faceless masses,
p205
aVto imagine that we can know what they're really thinking.
p206
aa(lp207
VThe first time I met Min, she had just turned 18
p208
aVand quit her first job on the assembly line
p209
aVof an electronics factory.
p210
aVOver the next two years, I watched as she switched jobs
p211
aVfive times, eventually landing a lucrative post
p212
aVin the purchasing department of a hardware factory.
p213
aVLater, she married a fellow migrant worker,
p214
aVmoved with him to his village,
p215
aVgave birth to two daughters,
p216
aVand saved enough money to buy a secondhand Buick
p217
aVfor herself and an apartment for her parents.
p218
aVShe recently returned to Dongguan on her own
p219
aVto take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes,
p220
aVtemporarily leaving her husband and children
p221
aVback in the village.
p222
aa(lp223
VIn a recent email to me, she explained,
p224
aV"A person should have some ambition while she is young
p225
aVso that in old age she can look back on her life
p226
aVand feel that it was not lived to no purpose."
p227
aa(lp228
VAcross China, there are 150 million workers like her,
p229
aVone third of them women, who have left their villages
p230
aVto work in the factories, the hotels, the restaurants
p231
aVand the construction sites of the big cities.
p232
aVTogether, they make up the largest migration in history,
p233
aVand it is globalization, this chain that begins
p234
aVin a Chinese farming village
p235
aVand ends with iPhones in our pockets and Nikes on our feet
p236
aVand Coach handbags on our arms
p237
aVthat has changed the way these millions of people
p238
aVwork and marry and live and think.
p239
aVVery few of them would want to go back
p240
aVto the way things used to be.
p241
aa(lp242
VWhen I first went to Dongguan, I worried that
p243
aVit would be depressing to spend so much time with workers.
p244
aVI also worried that nothing would ever happen to them,
p245
aVor that they would have nothing to say to me.
p246
aVInstead, I found young women who were smart and funny
p247
aVand brave and generous.
p248
aVBy opening up their lives to me,
p249
aVthey taught me so much about factories
p250
aVand about China and about how to live in the world.
p251
aa(lp252
VThis is the Coach purse that Min gave me
p253
aVon the train home to visit her family.
p254
aVI keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me
p255
aVto the young women I wrote about,
p256
aVties that are not economic but personal in nature,
p257
aVmeasured not in money but in memories.
p258
aVThis purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine,
p259
aVsitting in your office or in the library,
p260
aVare not how you find them when you actually go out
p261
aVinto the world.
p262
aa(lp263
VThank you. (Applause)
p264
aV(Applause)
p265
aa(lp266
VChris Anderson: Thank you, Leslie, that was an insight
p267
aVthat a lot of us haven't had before.
p268
aVBut I'm curious. If you had a minute, say,
p269
aVwith Apple's head of manufacturing,
p270
aVwhat would you say?
p271
aa(lp272
VLeslie Chang: One minute?
p273
aa(lp274
VCA: One minute. (Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VLC: You know, what really impressed me about the workers
p277
aVis how much they're self-motivated, self-driven,
p278
aVresourceful, and the thing that struck me,
p279
aVwhat they want most is education, to learn,
p280
aVbecause most of them come from very poor backgrounds.
p281
aVThey usually left school when they were in 7th or 8th grade.
p282
aVTheir parents are often illiterate,
p283
aVand then they come to the city, and they, on their own,
p284
aVat night, during the weekends, they'll take a computer class,
p285
aVthey'll take an English class, and learn
p286
aVreally, really rudimentary things, you know,
p287
aVlike how to type a document in Word,
p288
aVor how to say really simple things in English.
p289
aVSo, if you really want to help these workers,
p290
aVstart these small, very focused, very pragmatic classes
p291
aVin these schools, and what's going to happen is,
p292
aVall your workers are going to move on,
p293
aVbut hopefully they'll move on into higher jobs within Apple,
p294
aVand you can help their social mobility
p295
aVand their self-improvement.
p296
aVWhen you talk to workers, that's what they want.
p297
aVThey do not say, "I want better hot water in the showers.
p298
aVI want a nicer room. I want a TV set."
p299
aVI mean, it would be nice to have those things,
p300
aVbut that's not why they're in the city,
p301
aVand that's not what they care about.
p302
aa(lp303
VCA: Was there a sense from them of a narrative that
p304
aVthings were kind of tough and bad, or was there a narrative
p305
aVof some kind of level of growth, that things over time
p306
aVwere getting better?
p307
aa(lp308
VLC: Oh definitely, definitely. I mean, you know,
p309
aVit was interesting, because I spent basically two years
p310
aVhanging out in this city, Dongguan,
p311
aVand over that time, you could see immense change
p312
aVin every person's life: upward, downward, sideways,
p313
aVbut generally upward.
p314
aVIf you spend enough time, it's upward, and I met people
p315
aVwho had moved to the city 10 years ago, and who are now
p316
aVbasically urban middle class people,
p317
aVso the trajectory is definitely upward.
p318
aVIt's just hard to see when you're suddenly
p319
aVsucked into the city. It looks like everyone's poor and
p320
aVdesperate, but that's not really how it is.
p321
aVCertainly, the factory conditions are really tough,
p322
aVand it's nothing you or I would want to do,
p323
aVbut from their perspective, where they're coming from
p324
aVis much worse, and where they're going
p325
aVis hopefully much better, and I just wanted to give
p326
aVthat context of what's going on in their minds,
p327
aVnot what necessarily is going on in yours.
p328
aa(lp329
VCA: Thanks so much for your talk.
p330
aVThank you very much. (Applause)
