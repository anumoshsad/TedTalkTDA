VIt is a thrill to be here at a conference
p4
aVthat's devoted to "Inspired by Nature" \u2014 you can imagine.
p5
aVAnd I'm also thrilled to be in the foreplay section.
p6
aVDid you notice this section is foreplay?
p7
aVBecause I get to talk about one of my favorite critters,
p8
aVwhich is the Western Grebe. You haven't lived
p9
aVuntil you've seen these guys do their courtship dance.
p10
aVI was on Bowman Lake in Glacier National Park,
p11
aVwhich is a long, skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it,
p12
aVand my partner and I have a rowing shell.
p13
aVAnd so we were rowing, and one of these Western Grebes came along.
p14
aVAnd what they do for their courtship dance is, they go together,
p15
aVthe two of them, the two mates, and they begin to run underwater.
p16
aVThey paddle faster, and faster, and faster, until they're going so fast
p17
aVthat they literally lift up out of the water,
p18
aVand they're standing upright, sort of paddling the top of the water.
p19
aVAnd one of these Grebes came along while we were rowing.
p20
aVAnd so we're in a skull, and we're moving really, really quickly.
p21
aVAnd this Grebe, I think, sort of, mistaked us for a prospect,
p22
aVand started to run along the water next to us,
p23
aVin a courtship dance \u2014 for miles.
p24
aVIt would stop, and then start, and then stop, and then start.
p25
aVNow that is foreplay.
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VI came this close to changing species at that moment.
p29
aVObviously, life can teach us something
p30
aVin the entertainment section. Life has a lot to teach us.
p31
aVBut what I'd like to talk about today
p32
aVis what life might teach us in technology and in design.
p33
aVWhat's happened since the book came out \u2014
p34
aVthe book was mainly about research in biomimicry \u2014
p35
aVand what's happened since then is architects, designers, engineers \u2014
p36
aVpeople who make our world \u2014 have started to call and say,
p37
aVwe want a biologist to sit at the design table
p38
aVto help us, in real time, become inspired.
p39
aVOr \u2014 and this is the fun part for me \u2014 we want you to take us out
p40
aVinto the natural world. We'll come with a design challenge
p41
aVand we find the champion adapters in the natural world, who might inspire us.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took
p44
aVwith some wastewater treatment engineers; they purify wastewater.
p45
aVAnd some of them were very resistant, actually, to being there.
p46
aVWhat they said to us at first was, you know, we already do biomimicry.
p47
aVWe use bacteria to clean our water. And we said,
p48
aVwell, that's not exactly being inspired by nature.
p49
aVThat's bioprocessing, you know; that's bio-assisted technology:
p50
aVusing an organism to do your wastewater treatment
p51
aVis an old, old technology called "domestication."
p52
aVThis is learning something, learning an idea, from an organism and then applying it.
p53
aVAnd so they still weren't getting it.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo we went for a walk on the beach and I said,
p56
aVwell, give me one of your big problems. Give me a design challenge,
p57
aVsustainability speed bump, that's keeping you from being sustainable.
p58
aVAnd they said scaling, which is the build-up of minerals inside of pipes.
p59
aVAnd they said, you know what happens is, mineral \u2014
p60
aVjust like at your house \u2014 mineral builds up.
p61
aVAnd then the aperture closes, and we have to flush the pipes with toxins,
p62
aVor we have to dig them up.
p63
aVSo if we had some way to stop this scaling \u2014
p64
aVand so I picked up some shells on the beach. And I asked them,
p65
aVwhat is scaling? What's inside your pipes?
p66
aVAnd they said, calcium carbonate.
p67
aVAnd I said, that's what this is; this is calcium carbonate.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd they didn't know that.
p70
aVThey didn't know that what a seashell is,
p71
aVit's templated by proteins, and then ions from the seawater
p72
aVcrystallize in place to create a shell.
p73
aVSo the same sort of a process, without the proteins,
p74
aVis happening on the inside of their pipes. They didn't know.
p75
aVThis is not for lack of information; it's a lack of integration.
p76
aVYou know, it's a silo, people in silos. They didn't know
p77
aVthat the same thing was happening. So one of them thought about it
p78
aVand said, OK, well, if this is just crystallization
p79
aVthat happens automatically out of seawater \u2014 self-assembly \u2014
p80
aVthen why aren't shells infinite in size? What stops the scaling?
p81
aVWhy don't they just keep on going?
p82
aVAnd I said, well, in the same way
p83
aVthat they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization \u2014
p84
aVand then they all sort of leaned in \u2014
p85
aVthey let go of a protein that stops the crystallization.
p86
aVIt literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal.
p87
aVAnd, in fact, there is a product called TPA
p88
aVthat's mimicked that protein \u2014 that stop-protein \u2014
p89
aVand it's an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes.
p90
aa(lp91
VThat changed everything. From then on,
p92
aVyou could not get these engineers back in the boat.
p93
aVThe first day they would take a hike,
p94
aVand it was, click, click, click, click. Five minutes later they were back in the boat.
p95
aVWe're done. You know, I've seen that island.
p96
aVAfter this,
p97
aVthey were crawling all over. They would snorkel
p98
aVfor as long as we would let them snorkel.
p99
aVWhat had happened was that they realized that there were organisms
p100
aVout there that had already solved the problems
p101
aVthat they had spent their careers trying to solve.
p102
aa(lp103
VLearning about the natural world is one thing;
p104
aVlearning from the natural world \u2014 that's the switch.
p105
aVThat's the profound switch.
p106
aVWhat they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere;
p107
aVthey just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world.
p108
aV3.8 billion years of field-testing.
p109
aV10 to 30 \u2014 Craig Venter will probably tell you;
p110
aVI think there's a lot more than 30 million \u2014 well-adapted solutions.
p111
aVThe important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context.
p112
aVAnd the context is the Earth \u2014
p113
aVthe same context that we're trying to solve our problems in.
p114
aVSo it's the conscious emulation of life's genius.
p115
aVIt's not slavishly mimicking \u2014
p116
aValthough Al is trying to get the hairdo going \u2014
p117
aVit's not a slavish mimicry; it's taking the design principles,
p118
aVthe genius of the natural world, and learning something from it.
p119
aa(lp120
VNow, in a group with so many IT people, I do have to mention what
p121
aVI'm not going to talk about, and that is that your field
p122
aVis one that has learned an enormous amount from living things,
p123
aVon the software side. So there's computers that protect themselves,
p124
aVlike an immune system, and we're learning from gene regulation
p125
aVand biological development. And we're learning from neural nets,
p126
aVgenetic algorithms, evolutionary computing.
p127
aVThat's on the software side. But what's interesting to me
p128
aVis that we haven't looked at this, as much. I mean, these machines
p129
aVare really not very high tech in my estimation
p130
aVin the sense that there's dozens and dozens of carcinogens
p131
aVin the water in Silicon Valley.
p132
aVSo the hardware
p133
aVis not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success.
p134
aVSo what can we learn about making \u2014 not just computers, but everything?
p135
aVThe plane you came in, cars, the seats that you're sitting on.
p136
aVHow do we redesign the world that we make, the human-made world?
p137
aVMore importantly, what should we ask in the next 10 years?
p138
aVAnd there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has.
p139
aa(lp140
VWhat's the syllabus?
p141
aVThree questions, for me, are key.
p142
aVHow does life make things?
p143
aVThis is the opposite; this is how we make things.
p144
aVIt's called heat, beat and treat \u2014
p145
aVthat's what material scientists call it.
p146
aVAnd it's carving things down from the top, with 96 percent waste left over
p147
aVand only 4 percent product. You heat it up; you beat it with high pressures;
p148
aVyou use chemicals. OK. Heat, beat and treat.
p149
aa(lp150
VLife can't afford to do that. How does life make things?
p151
aVHow does life make the most of things?
p152
aVThat's a geranium pollen.
p153
aVAnd its shape is what gives it the function of being able
p154
aVto tumble through air so easily. Look at that shape.
p155
aVLife adds information to matter.
p156
aVIn other words: structure.
p157
aVIt gives it information. By adding information to matter,
p158
aVit gives it a function that's different than without that structure.
p159
aVAnd thirdly, how does life make things disappear into systems?
p160
aVBecause life doesn't really deal in things;
p161
aVthere are no things in the natural world divorced
p162
aVfrom their systems.
p163
aVReally quick syllabus.
p164
aVAs I'm reading more and more now, and following the story,
p165
aVthere are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences.
p166
aVAnd at the same time, I'm listening to a lot of businesses
p167
aVand finding what their sort of grand challenges are.
p168
aVThe two groups are not talking to each other.
p169
aVAt all.
p170
aa(lp171
VWhat in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture,
p172
aVto get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we're in?
p173
aVI'm going to try to go through 12, really quickly.
p174
aa(lp175
VOne that's exciting to me is self-assembly.
p176
aVNow, you've heard about this in terms of nanotechnology.
p177
aVBack to that shell: the shell is a self-assembling material.
p178
aVOn the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl
p179
aVforming out of seawater. It's a layered structure that's mineral
p180
aVand then polymer, and it makes it very, very tough.
p181
aVIt's twice as tough as our high-tech ceramics.
p182
aVBut what's really interesting: unlike our ceramics that are in kilns,
p183
aVit happens in seawater. It happens near, in and near, the organism's body.
p184
aVThis is Sandia National Labs.
p185
aVA guy named Jeff Brinker
p186
aVhas found a way to have a self-assembling coding process.
p187
aVImagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature
p188
aVby simply dipping something into a liquid,
p189
aVlifting it out of the liquid, and having evaporation
p190
aVforce the molecules in the liquid together,
p191
aVso that they jigsaw together
p192
aVin the same way as this crystallization works.
p193
aVImagine making all of our hard materials that way.
p194
aVImagine spraying the precursors to a PV cell, to a solar cell,
p195
aVonto a roof, and having it self-assemble into a layered structure that harvests light.
p196
aa(lp197
VHere's an interesting one for the IT world:
p198
aVbio-silicon. This is a diatom, which is made of silicates.
p199
aVAnd so silicon, which we make right now \u2014
p200
aVit's part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips \u2014
p201
aVthis is a bio-mineralization process that's now being mimicked.
p202
aVThis is at UC Santa Barbara. Look at these diatoms.
p203
aVThis is from Ernst Haeckel's work.
p204
aVImagine being able to \u2014 and, again, it's a templated process,
p205
aVand it solidifies out of a liquid process \u2014 imagine being able to have that
p206
aVsort of structure coming out at room temperature.
p207
aVImagine being able to make perfect lenses.
p208
aVOn the left, this is a brittle star; it's covered with lenses
p209
aVthat the people at Lucent Technologies have found
p210
aVhave no distortion whatsoever.
p211
aVIt's one of the most distortion-free lenses we know of.
p212
aVAnd there's many of them, all over its entire body.
p213
aVWhat's interesting, again, is that it self-assembles.
p214
aVA woman named Joanna Aizenberg, at Lucent,
p215
aVis now learning to do this in a low-temperature process to create
p216
aVthese sort of lenses. She's also looking at fiber optics.
p217
aVThat's a sea sponge that has a fiber optic.
p218
aVDown at the very base of it, there's fiber optics
p219
aVthat work better than ours, actually, to move light,
p220
aVbut you can tie them in a knot; they're incredibly flexible.
p221
aa(lp222
VHere's another big idea: CO2 as a feedstock.
p223
aVA guy named Geoff Coates, at Cornell, said to himself,
p224
aVyou know, plants do not see CO2 as the biggest poison of our time.
p225
aVWe see it that way. Plants are busy making long chains
p226
aVof starches and glucose, right, out of CO2. He's found a way \u2014
p227
aVhe's found a catalyst \u2014 and he's found a way to take CO2
p228
aVand make it into polycarbonates. Biodegradable plastics
p229
aVout of CO2 \u2014 how plant-like.
p230
aa(lp231
VSolar transformations: the most exciting one.
p232
aVThere are people who are mimicking the energy-harvesting device
p233
aVinside of purple bacterium, the people at ASU. Even more interesting,
p234
aVlately, in the last couple of weeks, people have seen
p235
aVthat there's an enzyme called hydrogenase that's able to evolve
p236
aVhydrogen from proton and electrons, and is able to take hydrogen up \u2014
p237
aVbasically what's happening in a fuel cell, in the anode of a fuel cell
p238
aVand in a reversible fuel cell.
p239
aVIn our fuel cells, we do it with platinum;
p240
aVlife does it with a very, very common iron.
p241
aVAnd a team has now just been able to mimic
p242
aVthat hydrogen-juggling hydrogenase.
p243
aVThat's very exciting for fuel cells \u2014
p244
aVto be able to do that without platinum.
p245
aa(lp246
VPower of shape: here's a whale. We've seen that the fins of this whale
p247
aVhave tubercles on them. And those little bumps
p248
aVactually increase efficiency in, for instance,
p249
aVthe edge of an airplane \u2014 increase efficiency by about 32 percent.
p250
aVWhich is an amazing fossil fuel savings,
p251
aVif we were to just put that on the edge of a wing.
p252
aVColor without pigments: this peacock is creating color with shape.
p253
aVLight comes through, it bounces back off the layers;
p254
aVit's called thin-film interference. Imagine being able
p255
aVto self-assemble products with the last few layers
p256
aVplaying with light to create color.
p257
aVImagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface,
p258
aVso that it's self-cleaning with just water. That's what a leaf does.
p259
aVSee that up-close picture?
p260
aVThat's a ball of water, and those are dirt particles.
p261
aVAnd that's an up-close picture of a lotus leaf.
p262
aVThere's a company making a product called Lotusan, which mimics \u2014
p263
aVwhen the building facade paint dries, it mimics the bumps
p264
aVin a self-cleaning leaf, and rainwater cleans the building.
p265
aa(lp266
VWater is going to be our big, grand challenge:
p267
aVquenching thirst.
p268
aVHere are two organisms that pull water.
p269
aVThe one on the left is the Namibian beetle pulling water out of fog.
p270
aVThe one on the right is a pill bug \u2014 pulls water out of air,
p271
aVdoes not drink fresh water.
p272
aVPulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta,
p273
aVbefore it gets into a building, are key technologies.
p274
aa(lp275
VSeparation technologies are going to be extremely important.
p276
aVWhat if we were to say, no more hard rock mining?
p277
aVWhat if we were to separate out metals from waste streams,
p278
aVsmall amounts of metals in water? That's what microbes do;
p279
aVthey chelate metals out of water.
p280
aVThere's a company here in San Francisco called MR3
p281
aVthat is embedding mimics of the microbes' molecules on filters
p282
aVto mine waste streams.
p283
aVGreen chemistry is chemistry in water.
p284
aVWe do chemistry in organic solvents.
p285
aVThis is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider
p286
aVand the silk being formed from a spider. Isn't that beautiful?
p287
aVGreen chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book.
p288
aVIt's not easy, because life uses
p289
aVonly a subset of the elements in the periodic table.
p290
aVAnd we use all of them, even the toxic ones.
p291
aVTo figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset
p292
aVof the periodic table, and create miracle materials like that cell,
p293
aVis the task of green chemistry.
p294
aa(lp295
VTimed degradation: packaging that is good
p296
aVuntil you don't want it to be good anymore, and dissolves on cue.
p297
aVThat's a mussel you can find in the waters out here,
p298
aVand the threads holding it to a rock are timed; at exactly two years,
p299
aVthey begin to dissolve.
p300
aa(lp301
VHealing: this is a good one.
p302
aVThat little guy over there is a tardigrade.
p303
aVThere is a problem with vaccines around the world
p304
aVnot getting to patients. And the reason is
p305
aVthat the refrigeration somehow gets broken;
p306
aVwhat's called the "cold chain" gets broken.
p307
aVA guy named Bruce Rosner looked at the tardigrade \u2014
p308
aVwhich dries out completely, and yet stays alive for months
p309
aVand months and months, and is able to regenerate itself.
p310
aVAnd he found a way to dry out vaccines \u2014
p311
aVencase them in the same sort of sugar capsules
p312
aVas the tardigrade has within its cells \u2014
p313
aVmeaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated.
p314
aVThey can be put in a glove compartment, OK.
p315
aVLearning from organisms. This is a session about water \u2014
p316
aVlearning about organisms that can do without water,
p317
aVin order to create a vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration.
p318
aa(lp319
VI'm not going to get to 12.
p320
aVBut what I am going to do is tell you that the most important thing,
p321
aVbesides all of these adaptations, is the fact that these organisms
p322
aVhave figured out a way to do the amazing things they do
p323
aVwhile taking care of the place
p324
aVthat's going to take care of their offspring.
p325
aVWhen they're involved in foreplay,
p326
aVthey're thinking about something very, very important \u2014
p327
aVand that's having their genetic material
p328
aVremain, 10,000 generations from now.
p329
aVAnd that means finding a way to do what they do
p330
aVwithout destroying the place that'll take care of their offspring.
p331
aVThat's the biggest design challenge.
p332
aVLuckily, there are millions and millions of geniuses
p333
aVwilling to gift us with their best ideas.
p334
aVGood luck having a conversation with them.
p335
aa(lp336
VThank you.
p337
aa(lp338
V(Applause)
p339
aa(lp340
VChris Anderson: Talk about foreplay, I \u2014 we need to get to 12, but really quickly.
p341
aa(lp342
VJanine Benyus: Oh really?
p343
aVCA: Yeah. Just like, you know, like the 10-second version
p344
aVof 10, 11 and 12. Because we just \u2014 your slides are so gorgeous,
p345
aVand the ideas are so big, I can't stand to let you go down
p346
aVwithout seeing 10, 11 and 12.
p347
aa(lp348
VJB: OK, put this \u2014 OK, I'll just hold this thing. OK, great.
p349
aVOK, so that's the healing one.
p350
aVSensing and responding: feedback is a huge thing.
p351
aVThis is a locust. There can be 80 million of them in a square kilometer,
p352
aVand yet they don't collide with one another.
p353
aVAnd yet we have 3.6 million car collisions a year.
p354
aV(Laughter)
p355
aVRight. There's a person at Newcastle
p356
aVwho has figured out that it's a very large neuron.
p357
aVAnd she's actually figuring out how to make
p358
aVa collision-avoidance circuitry
p359
aVbased on this very large neuron in the locust.
p360
aa(lp361
VThis is a huge and important one, number 11.
p362
aVAnd that's the growing fertility.
p363
aVThat means, you know, net fertility farming.
p364
aVWe should be growing fertility. And, oh yes \u2014 we get food, too.
p365
aVBecause we have to grow the capacity of this planet
p366
aVto create more and more opportunities for life.
p367
aVAnd really, that's what other organisms do as well.
p368
aVIn ensemble, that's what whole ecosystems do:
p369
aVthey create more and more opportunities for life.
p370
aVOur farming has done the opposite.
p371
aVSo, farming based on how a prairie builds soil,
p372
aVranching based on how a native ungulate herd
p373
aVactually increases the health of the range,
p374
aVeven wastewater treatment based on how a marsh
p375
aVnot only cleans the water,
p376
aVbut creates incredibly sparkling productivity.
p377
aa(lp378
VThis is the simple design brief. I mean, it looks simple
p379
aVbecause the system, over 3.8 billion years, has worked this out.
p380
aVThat is, those organisms that have not been able to figure out
p381
aVhow to enhance or sweeten their places,
p382
aVare not around to tell us about it.
p383
aVThat's the twelfth one.
p384
aVLife \u2014 and this is the secret trick; this is the magic trick \u2014
p385
aVlife creates conditions conducive to life.
p386
aVIt builds soil; it cleans air; it cleans water;
p387
aVit mixes the cocktail of gases that you and I need to live.
p388
aVAnd it does that in the middle of having great foreplay
p389
aVand meeting their needs. So it's not mutually exclusive.
p390
aVWe have to find a way to meet our needs,
p391
aVwhile making of this place an Eden.
