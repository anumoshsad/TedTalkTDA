VThe first time I stood in the operating room
p4
aVand watched a real surgery,
p5
aVI had no idea what to expect.
p6
aVI was a college student in engineering.
p7
aVI thought it was going to be like on TV.
p8
aVOminous music playing in the background,
p9
aVbeads of sweat pouring down the surgeon's face.
p10
aVBut it wasn't like that at all.
p11
aVThere was music playing on this day,
p12
aVI think it was Madonna's greatest hits. (Laughter)
p13
aVAnd there was plenty of conversation,
p14
aVnot just about the patient's heart rate,
p15
aVbut about sports and weekend plans.
p16
aVAnd since then, the more surgeries I watched,
p17
aVthe more I realized this is how it is.
p18
aVIn some weird way, it's just another day at the office.
p19
aVBut every so often
p20
aVthe music gets turned down,
p21
aVeveryone stops talking,
p22
aVand stares at exactly the same thing.
p23
aVAnd that's when you know that something absolutely critical
p24
aVand dangerous is happening.
p25
aa(lp26
VThe first time I saw that
p27
aVI was watching a type of surgery
p28
aVcalled laparoscopic surgery
p29
aVAnd for those of you who are unfamiliar,
p30
aVlaparoscopic surgery, instead of the large
p31
aVopen incision you might be used to with surgery,
p32
aVa laparoscopic surgery is where the surgeon creates
p33
aVthese three or more small incisions in the patient.
p34
aVAnd then inserts these long, thin instruments
p35
aVand a camera,
p36
aVand actually does the procedure inside the patient.
p37
aVThis is great because there's much less risk of infection,
p38
aVmuch less pain, shorter recovery time.
p39
aVBut there is a trade-off,
p40
aVbecause these incisions are created
p41
aVwith a long, pointed device
p42
aVcalled a trocar.
p43
aVAnd the way the surgeon uses this device
p44
aVis that he takes it
p45
aVand he presses it into the abdomen
p46
aVuntil it punctures through.
p47
aVAnd now the reason why  everyone in the operating room
p48
aVwas staring at that device on that day
p49
aVwas because he had to be absolutely careful
p50
aVnot to plunge it through
p51
aVand puncture it into the organs  and blood vessels below.
p52
aVBut this problem should seem  pretty familiar to all of you
p53
aVbecause I'm pretty sure  you've seen it somewhere else.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVRemember this?
p56
aV(Applause)
p57
aVYou knew that at any second
p58
aVthat straw was going to plunge through,
p59
aVand you didn't know if it was  going to go out the other side
p60
aVand straight into your hand,
p61
aVor if you were going to get juice everywhere,
p62
aVbut you were terrified. Right?
p63
aVEvery single time you did this,
p64
aVyou experienced the same fundamental physics
p65
aVthat I was watching in the operating room that day.
p66
aVAnd it turns out it really is a problem.
p67
aVIn 2003, the FDA actually came out and said
p68
aVthat trocar incisions might  be the most dangerous step
p69
aVin minimally invasive surgery.
p70
aVAgain in 2009, we see a paper that says
p71
aVthat trocars account for over half
p72
aVof all major complications in laparoscopic surgery.
p73
aVAnd, oh by the way,
p74
aVthis hasn't changed for 25 years.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo when I got to graduate school,
p77
aVthis is what I wanted to work on.
p78
aVI was trying to explain to a friend of mine
p79
aVwhat exactly I was spending my time doing,
p80
aVand I said,
p81
aV"It's like when you're drilling through a wall
p82
aVto hang something in your apartment.
p83
aVThere's that moment when the drill first punctures through the wall
p84
aVand there's this plunge. Right?
p85
aVAnd he looked at me and he said,
p86
aV"You mean like when they drill  into people's brains?"
p87
aVAnd I said, "Excuse me?" (Laughter)
p88
aVAnd then I looked it up and they do drill into people's brains.
p89
aVA lot of neurosurgical procedures
p90
aVactually start with a drill incision through the skull.
p91
aVAnd if the surgeon isn't careful,
p92
aVhe can plunge directly into the brain.
p93
aVSo this is the moment when I started thinking,
p94
aVokay, cranial drilling, laparoscopic surgery,
p95
aVwhy not other areas of medicine?
p96
aVBecause think about it, when was the last time you went to the doctor
p97
aVand you didn't get stuck with something? Right?
p98
aVSo the truth is
p99
aVin medicine puncture is everywhere.
p100
aVAnd here are just a couple of the procedures that I've found
p101
aVthat involve some tissue puncture step.
p102
aVAnd if we take just three of them \u2014
p103
aVlaparoscopic surgery,  epidurals, and cranial drilling \u2014
p104
aVthese procedures account  for over 30,000 complications
p105
aVevery year in this country alone.
p106
aVI call that a problem worth solving.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo let's take a look at some of the devices
p109
aVthat are used in these types of procedures.
p110
aVI mentioned epidurals. This is an epidural needle.
p111
aVIt's used to puncture through  the ligaments in the spine
p112
aVand deliver anesthesia during childbirth.
p113
aVHere's a set of bone marrow biopsy tools.
p114
aVThese are actually used to burrow into the bone
p115
aVand collect bone marrow or sample bone lesions.
p116
aVHere's a bayonette from the Civil War.
p117
aV(Laughter)
p118
aVIf I had told you it was a  medical puncture device
p119
aVyou probably would have believed me.
p120
aVBecause what's the difference?
p121
aVSo, the more I did this research
p122
aVthe more I thought there has to be
p123
aVa better way to do this.
p124
aVAnd for me the key to this problem
p125
aVis that all these different puncture devices
p126
aVshare a common set of fundamental physics.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo what are those physics?
p129
aVLet's go back to drilling through a wall.
p130
aVSo you're applying a force  on a drill towards the wall.
p131
aVAnd Newton says the wall is going to apply force back,
p132
aVequal and opposite.
p133
aVSo, as you drill through the wall,
p134
aVthose forces balance.
p135
aVBut then there's that moment
p136
aVwhen the drill first punctures through the other side of the wall,
p137
aVand right at that moment  the wall can't push back anymore.
p138
aVBut your brain hasn't reacted  to that change in force.
p139
aVSo for that millisecond,
p140
aVor however long it takes you  to react, you're still pushing,
p141
aVand that unbalanced force  causes an acceleration,
p142
aVand that is the plunge.
p143
aVBut what if right at the moment of puncture
p144
aVyou could pull that tip back,
p145
aVactually oppose the forward acceleration?
p146
aVThat's what I set out to do.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo imagine you have a device
p149
aVand it's got some kind of sharp tip  to cut through tissue.
p150
aVWhat's the simplest way  you could pull that tip back?
p151
aVI chose a spring.
p152
aVSo when you extend that spring,  you extend that tip out
p153
aVso it's ready to puncture tissue,
p154
aVthe spring wants to pull the tip back.
p155
aVHow do you keep the tip in place
p156
aVuntil the moment of puncture?
p157
aVI used this mechanism.
p158
aVWhen the tip of the device is pressed against tissue,
p159
aVthe mechanism expands outwards  and wedges in place against the wall.
p160
aVAnd the friction that's generated
p161
aVlocks it in place and prevents the spring from retracting the tip.
p162
aVBut right at the moment of puncture,
p163
aVthe tissue can't push back on the tip anymore.
p164
aVSo the mechanism unlocks  and the spring retracts the tip.
p165
aVLet me show you that  happening in slow motion.
p166
aVThis is about 2,000 frames a second,
p167
aVand I'd like you to notice the tip
p168
aVthat's right there on the bottom,  about to puncture through tissue.
p169
aVAnd you'll see that  right at the moment of puncture,
p170
aVright there, the mechanism unlocks  and retracts that tip back.
p171
aVI want to show it to you again, a little closer up.
p172
aVYou're going to see the sharp bladed tip,
p173
aVand right when it punctures  that rubber membrane
p174
aVit's going to disappear into this white blunt sheath.
p175
aVRight there.
p176
aVThat happens within four 100ths  of a second after puncture.
p177
aVAnd because this device is designed to address the physics of puncture
p178
aVand not the specifics of cranial drilling
p179
aVor laparoscopic surgery,  or another procedure,
p180
aVit's applicable across these different medical disciplines
p181
aVand across different length scales.
p182
aa(lp183
VBut it didn't always look like this.
p184
aVThis was my first prototype.
p185
aVYes, those are popsicle sticks,
p186
aVand there's a rubber band at the top.
p187
aVIt took about 30 minutes to do this, but it worked.
p188
aVAnd it proved to me that my idea worked
p189
aVand it justified the next couple years of work on this project.
p190
aVI worked on this because
p191
aVthis problem really fascinated me.
p192
aVIt kept me up at night.
p193
aVBut I think it should fascinate you too,
p194
aVbecause I said puncture is everywhere.
p195
aVThat means at some point  it's going to be your problem too.
p196
aVThat first day in the operating room
p197
aVI never expected to find myself  on the other end of a trocar.
p198
aVBut last year, I got appendicitis  when I was visiting Greece.
p199
aVSo I was in the hospital in Athens,
p200
aVand the surgeon was telling me
p201
aVhe was going to perform  a laparoscopic surgery.
p202
aVHe was going to remove my appendix  through these tiny incisions,
p203
aVand he was talking about what I could expect for the recovery,
p204
aVand what was going to happen.
p205
aVHe said, "Do you have any questions?" And I said, "Just one, doc.
p206
aVWhat kind of trocar do you use?"
p207
aa(lp208
VSo my favorite quote  about laparoscopic surgery
p209
aVcomes from a Doctor H. C. Jacobaeus:
p210
aV"It is puncture itself that causes risk."
p211
aVThat's my favorite quote  because H.C. Jacobaeus
p212
aVwas the first person to ever perform  laparoscopic surgery on humans,
p213
aVand he wrote that in 1912.
p214
aVThis is a problem that's been injuring and even killing people for over 100 years.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo it's easy to think that for every major problem out there
p217
aVthere's some team of experts  working around the clock to solve it.
p218
aVThe truth is that's not always the case.
p219
aVWe have to be better at finding those problems
p220
aVand finding ways to solve them.
p221
aVSo if you come across a problem that grabs you,
p222
aVlet it keep you up at night.
p223
aVAllow yourself to be fascinated,
p224
aVbecause there are so many lives to save.
