VThe child's symptoms begin

aVwith mild fever, headache, muscle pains,

aVfollowed by vomiting and diarrhea,
p6
aVthen bleeding from the mouth, nose and gums.

aVDeath follows in the form of organ failure from low blood pressure.

aa(lp9
VSounds familiar?
p10
aVIf you're thinking this is Ebola,
p11
aVactually, in this case, it's not.
p12
aVIt's an extreme form of dengue fever, a mosquito-born disease
p13
aVwhich also does not have an effective therapy or a vaccine,
p14
aVand kills 22,000 people each year.
p15
aVThat is actually twice the number of people
p16
aVthat have been killed by Ebola
p17
aVin the nearly four decades that we've known about it.
p18
aVAs for measles, so much in the news recently,
p19
aVthe death toll is actually tenfold higher.
p20
aVYet for the last year,
p21
aVit has been Ebola that has stolen all of the headlines and the fear.
p22
aa(lp23
VClearly, there is something deeply rooted about it,
p24
aVsomething which scares us and fascinates us
p25
aVmore than other diseases.
p26
aVBut what is it, exactly?
p27
aVWell, it's hard to acquire Ebola,
p28
aVbut if you do, the risk of a horrible death is high.
p29
aVWhy?
p30
aVBecause right now, we don't have any effective therapy or vaccine available.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd so, that's the clue.
p33
aVWe may have it someday.
p34
aVSo we rightfully fear Ebola,
p35
aVbecause it doesn't kill as many people as other diseases.
p36
aVIn fact, it's much less transmissible than viruses such as flu or measles.
p37
aVWe fear Ebola because of the fact that it kills us and we can't treat it.
p38
aVWe fear the certain inevitability that comes with Ebola.
p39
aVEbola has this inevitability that seems to defy modern medical science.
p40
aa(lp41
VBut wait a second, why is that?
p42
aVWe've known about Ebola since 1976.
p43
aVWe've known what it's capable of.
p44
aVWe've had ample opportunity to study it
p45
aVin the 24 outbreaks that have occurred.
p46
aVAnd in fact, we've actually had vaccine candidates available now
p47
aVfor more than a decade.
p48
aVWhy is that those vaccines are just going into clinical trials now?
p49
aa(lp50
VThis goes to the fundamental problem we have
p51
aVwith vaccine development for infectious diseases.
p52
aVIt goes something like this:
p53
aVThe people most at risk for these diseases
p54
aVare also the ones least able to pay for vaccines.
p55
aVThis leaves little in the way of market incentives
p56
aVfor manufacturers to develop vaccines,
p57
aVunless there are large numbers of people who are at risk in wealthy countries.
p58
aVIt's simply too commercially risky.
p59
aa(lp60
VAs for Ebola, there is absolutely no market at all,
p61
aVso the only reason we have two vaccines in late-stage clinical trials now,
p62
aVis actually because of a somewhat misguided fear.
p63
aVEbola was relatively ignored
p64
aVuntil September 11 and the anthrax attacks,
p65
aVwhen all of a sudden, people perceived Ebola
p66
aVas, potentially, a bioterrorism weapon.
p67
aa(lp68
VWhy is it that the Ebola vaccine wasn't fully developed at this point?
p69
aVWell, partially, because it was really difficult \u2014
p70
aVor thought to be difficult \u2014 to weaponize the virus,
p71
aVbut mainly because of the financial risk in developing it.
p72
aVAnd this is really the point.
p73
aVThe sad reality is, we develop vaccines
p74
aVnot based upon the risk the pathogen poses to people,
p75
aVbut on how economically risky it is to develop these vaccines.
p76
aVVaccine development is expensive and complicated.
p77
aVIt can cost hundreds of millions of dollars
p78
aVto take even a well-known antigen and turn it into a viable vaccine.
p79
aa(lp80
VFortunately for diseases like Ebola,
p81
aVthere are things we can do to remove some of these barriers.
p82
aVThe first is to recognize when there's a complete market failure.
p83
aVIn that case, if we want vaccines,
p84
aVwe have to provide incentives or some type of subsidy.
p85
aVWe also need to do a better job at being able to figure out
p86
aVwhich are the diseases that most threaten us.
p87
aVBy creating capabilities within countries, we then create the ability
p88
aVfor those countries to create epidemiological and laboratory networks
p89
aVwhich are capable of collecting and categorizing these pathogens.
p90
aVThe data from that then can be used
p91
aVto understand the geographic and genetic diversity,
p92
aVwhich then can be used to help us understand
p93
aVhow these are being changed immunologically,
p94
aVand what type of reactions they promote.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo these are the things that can be done,
p97
aVbut to do this, if we want to deal with a complete market failure,
p98
aVwe have to change the way we view and prevent infectious diseases.
p99
aVWe have to stop waiting until we see evidence
p100
aVof a disease becoming a global threat before we consider it as one.
p101
aVSo, for Ebola,
p102
aVthe paranoid fear of an infectious disease,
p103
aVfollowed by a few cases transported to wealthy countries,
p104
aVled the global community to come together,
p105
aVand with the work of dedicated vaccine companies,
p106
aVwe now have these:
p107
aVTwo Ebola vaccines in efficacy trials in the Ebola countries \u2014
p108
aa(lp109
V(Applause)
p110
aa(lp111
Vand a pipeline of vaccines that are following behind.
p112
aa(lp113
VEvery year, we spend billions of dollars,
p114
aVkeeping a fleet of nuclear submarines permanently patrolling the oceans
p115
aVto protect us from a threat that almost certainly will never happen.
p116
aVAnd yet, we spend virtually nothing
p117
aVto prevent something as tangible and evolutionarily certain
p118
aVas epidemic infectious diseases.
p119
aVAnd make no mistake about it \u2014 it's not a question of "if," but "when."
p120
aVThese bugs are going to continue to evolve
p121
aVand they're going to threaten the world.
p122
aVAnd vaccines are our best defense.
p123
aVSo if we want to be able to prevent epidemics like Ebola,
p124
aVwe need to take on the risk of investing in vaccine development
p125
aVand in stockpile creation.
p126
aVAnd we need to view this, then, as the ultimate deterrent \u2014
p127
aVsomething we make sure is available,
p128
aVbut at the same time, praying we never have to use it.
