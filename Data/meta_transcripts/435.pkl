VMy work is play.
p4
aVAnd I play when I design.
p5
aVI even looked it up in the dictionary, to make sure
p6
aVthat I actually do that,
p7
aVand the definition of play,
p8
aVnumber one, was engaging in a childlike
p9
aVactivity or endeavor,
p10
aVand number two was gambling.
p11
aVAnd I realize I do both
p12
aVwhen I'm designing.
p13
aVI'm both a kid and I'm gambling all the time.
p14
aVAnd I think that if you're not,
p15
aVthere's probably something inherently wrong
p16
aVwith the structure or the situation you're in,
p17
aVif you're a designer.
p18
aVBut the serious part is what threw me,
p19
aVand I couldn't quite get a handle
p20
aVon it until I remembered an essay.
p21
aVAnd it's an essay I read 30 years ago.
p22
aVIt was written by Russell Baker,
p23
aVwho used to write an "Observer" column in the New York Times.
p24
aVHe's a wonderful humorist. And I'm going to read you
p25
aVthis essay,
p26
aVor an excerpt from it
p27
aVbecause it really hit home for me.
p28
aVHere is a letter of friendly advice.
p29
aa(lp30
VBe serious, it says.
p31
aVWhat it means, of course, is, be solemn.
p32
aVBeing solemn is easy.
p33
aVBeing serious is hard.
p34
aVChildren almost always begin by being serious,
p35
aVwhich is what makes them so entertaining
p36
aVwhen compared with adults as a class.
p37
aVAdults, on the whole, are solemn.
p38
aVIn politics, the rare candidate who is serious,
p39
aVlike Adlai Stevenson,
p40
aVis easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn, like Eisenhower.
p41
aVThat's because it is hard for most people
p42
aVto recognize seriousness, which is rare,
p43
aVbut more comfortable to endorse solemnity,
p44
aVwhich is commonplace.
p45
aVJogging, which is commonplace,
p46
aVand widely accepted as good for you, is solemn.
p47
aVPoker is serious.
p48
aVWashington, D.C. is solemn.
p49
aVNew York is serious.
p50
aVGoing to educational conferences to tell you anything
p51
aVabout the future is solemn.
p52
aVTaking a long walk by yourself,
p53
aVduring which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing Tiffany's,
p54
aVis serious.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VNow, when I apply Russell Baker's definition
p59
aVof solemnity or seriousness to design,
p60
aVit doesn't necessarily make any particular point about quality.
p61
aVSolemn design is often important and very effective design.
p62
aVSolemn design is also socially correct,
p63
aVand is accepted by appropriate audiences.
p64
aVIt's what right-thinking designers
p65
aVand all the clients are striving for.
p66
aVSerious design, serious play,
p67
aVis something else.
p68
aVFor one thing, it often happens
p69
aVspontaneously, intuitively,
p70
aVaccidentally or incidentally.
p71
aVIt can be achieved out of innocence, or arrogance,
p72
aVor out of selfishness, sometimes out of carelessness.
p73
aVBut mostly, it's achieved through all those kind of crazy
p74
aVparts of human behavior that
p75
aVdon't really make any sense.
p76
aa(lp77
VSerious design is imperfect.
p78
aVIt's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being
p79
aVthe first of its kind.
p80
aVSerious design is also \u2014 often \u2014 quite unsuccessful
p81
aVfrom the solemn point of view.
p82
aVThat's because the art of serious play
p83
aVis about invention, change, rebellion \u2014 not perfection.
p84
aVPerfection happens during solemn play.
p85
aVNow, I always saw design careers
p86
aVlike surreal staircases.
p87
aVIf you look at the staircase, you'll see
p88
aVthat in your 20s the risers are very high
p89
aVand the steps are very short,
p90
aVand you make huge discoveries.
p91
aVYou sort of leap up very quickly in your youth.
p92
aVThat's because you don't know anything and you have a lot to learn,
p93
aVand so that anything you do is a learning experience
p94
aVand you're just jumping right up there.
p95
aVAs you get older, the risers get shallower
p96
aVand the steps get wider,
p97
aVand you start moving along at a slower pace
p98
aVbecause you're making fewer discoveries.
p99
aVAnd as you get older and more decrepit,
p100
aVyou sort of inch along on this
p101
aVsort of depressing, long staircase,
p102
aVleading you into oblivion.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VI find it's actually getting really hard to be serious.
p107
aVI'm hired to be solemn, but I find more and more
p108
aVthat I'm solemn when I don't have to be.
p109
aVAnd in my 35 years of working experience,
p110
aVI think I was really serious four times.
p111
aVAnd I'm going to show them to you now,
p112
aVbecause they came out of very specific conditions.
p113
aVIt's great to be a kid.
p114
aVNow, when I was in my early 20s,
p115
aVI worked in the record business, designing record covers for CBS Records,
p116
aVand I had no idea what a great job I had.
p117
aVI thought everybody had a job like that.
p118
aVAnd what \u2014
p119
aVthe way I looked at design and the way I looked at the world was,
p120
aVwhat was going on around me
p121
aVand the things that came at the time I walked into design
p122
aVwere the enemy.
p123
aVI really, really, really hated
p124
aVthe typeface Helvetica.
p125
aVI thought the typeface Helvetica
p126
aVwas the cleanest, most boring, most fascistic,
p127
aVreally repressive typeface,
p128
aVand I hated everything that was designed in Helvetica.
p129
aVAnd when I was in
p130
aVmy college days,
p131
aVthis was the sort of design
p132
aVthat was fashionable and popular.
p133
aVThis is actually quite a lovely book jacket by Rudy de Harak,
p134
aVbut I just hated it, because it was designed with Helvetica,
p135
aVand I made parodies about it.
p136
aVI just thought it was, you know, completely boring.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VSo \u2014 so, my goal in life
p141
aVwas to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica.
p142
aVAnd to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica
p143
aVwas actually kind of hard because you had to find it.
p144
aVAnd there weren't a lot of books about the history of design
p145
aVin the early 70s. There weren't \u2014
p146
aVthere wasn't a plethora of design publishing.
p147
aVYou actually had to go to antique stores. You had to go to Europe.
p148
aVYou had to go places and find the stuff.
p149
aVAnd what I responded to was, you know,
p150
aVArt Nouveau, or deco,
p151
aVor Victorian typography,
p152
aVor things that were just completely not Helvetica.
p153
aVAnd I taught myself design this way,
p154
aVand this was sort of my early years,
p155
aVand I used these things
p156
aVin really goofy ways
p157
aVon record covers and in my design.
p158
aVI wasn't educated. I just sort of
p159
aVput these things together.
p160
aVI mixed up Victorian designs with pop,
p161
aVand I mixed up Art Nouveau with something else.
p162
aVAnd I made these very lush,
p163
aVvery elaborate record covers,
p164
aVnot because I was being a post-modernist or a historicist \u2014
p165
aVbecause I didn't know what those things were.
p166
aVI just hated Helvetica.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd that kind of passion
p171
aVdrove me into very serious play,
p172
aVa kind of play I could never do now
p173
aVbecause I'm too well-educated.
p174
aVAnd there's something wonderful about
p175
aVthat form of youth,
p176
aVwhere you can let yourself
p177
aVgrow and play, and be
p178
aVreally a brat, and then accomplish things.
p179
aVBy the end of the '70s, actually,
p180
aVthe stuff became known.
p181
aVI mean, these covers appeared all over the world,
p182
aVand they started winning awards,
p183
aVand people knew them.
p184
aVAnd I was suddenly a post-modernist,
p185
aVand I began a career as \u2014 in my own business.
p186
aVAnd first I was praised for it, then criticized for it,
p187
aVbut the fact of the matter was, I had become solemn.
p188
aVI didn't do what I think
p189
aVwas a piece of serious work again for about 14 years.
p190
aVI spent most of the '80s being quite solemn,
p191
aVturning out these sorts of designs
p192
aVthat I was expected to do
p193
aVbecause that's who I was,
p194
aVand I was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn
p195
aVto hackneyed to dead, and getting rediscovered all over again.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo, here was the second condition
p198
aVfor which I think I accomplished some serious play.
p199
aVThere's a Paul Newman movie
p200
aVthat I love called "The Verdict."
p201
aVI don't know how many of you have seen it, but it's a beaut.
p202
aVAnd in the movie, he plays
p203
aVa down-and-out lawyer
p204
aVwho's become an ambulance chaser.
p205
aVAnd he's taken on \u2014
p206
aVhe's given, actually \u2014 a malpractice suit to handle
p207
aVthat's sort of an easy deal,
p208
aVand in the midst of trying to connect the deal,
p209
aVhe starts to empathize
p210
aVand identify with his client,
p211
aVand he regains his morality and purpose,
p212
aVand he goes on to win the case.
p213
aVAnd in the depth of despair,
p214
aVin the midst of the movie, when it looks like he can't pull this thing off,
p215
aVand he needs this case,
p216
aVhe needs to win this case so badly.
p217
aVThere's a shot of Paul Newman alone,
p218
aVin his office, saying,
p219
aV"This is the case. There are no other cases.
p220
aVThis is the case. There are no other cases."
p221
aVAnd in that moment of
p222
aVdesire and focus,
p223
aVhe can win.
p224
aVAnd that is a wonderful
p225
aVposition to be in to create some serious play.
p226
aVAnd I had that moment in 1994
p227
aVwhen I met a theater director
p228
aVnamed George Wolfe,
p229
aVwho was going to have me design
p230
aVan identity for the New York Shakespeare Festival,
p231
aVthen known,
p232
aVand then became the Public Theater.
p233
aVAnd I began getting immersed
p234
aVin this project
p235
aVin a way I never was before.
p236
aa(lp237
VThis is what theater advertising looked like at that time.
p238
aVThis is what was in the newspapers and in the New York Times.
p239
aVSo, this is sort of a comment on the time.
p240
aVAnd the Public Theater actually had much better advertising than this.
p241
aVThey had no logo and no identity,
p242
aVbut they had these very iconic posters
p243
aVpainted by Paul Davis.
p244
aVAnd George Wolf had taken over from another director
p245
aVand he wanted to change the theater,
p246
aVand he wanted to make it urban and loud
p247
aVand a place that was inclusive.
p248
aVSo, drawing on my love of typography,
p249
aVI immersed myself into this project.
p250
aVAnd what was different about it was the totality of it,
p251
aVwas that I really became the voice, the visual voice, of a place
p252
aVin a way I had never done before,
p253
aVwhere every aspect \u2014
p254
aVthe smallest ad, the ticket, whatever it was \u2014
p255
aVwas designed by me.
p256
aVThere was no format.
p257
aVThere was no in-house department that these things were pushed to.
p258
aVI literally for three years made everything \u2014
p259
aVevery scrap of paper, everything online,
p260
aVthat this theater did.
p261
aVAnd it was the only job,
p262
aVeven though I was doing other jobs.
p263
aVI lived and breathed it in a way I haven't
p264
aVwith a client since.
p265
aVIt enabled me to really express myself and grow.
p266
aVAnd I think that you know
p267
aVwhen you're going to be given this position,
p268
aVand it's rare, but when you get it and you have this opportunity,
p269
aVit's the moment of serious play.
p270
aa(lp271
VI did these things, and I still do them.
p272
aVI still work for the Public Theater.
p273
aVI'm on their board, and
p274
aVI still am involved with it.
p275
aVThe high point of the Public Theater, I think, was in 1996,
p276
aVtwo years after I designed it,
p277
aVwhich was the "Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk" campaign
p278
aVthat was all over New York.
p279
aVBut something happened to it, and what happened to it was,
p280
aVit became very popular.
p281
aVAnd that is a kiss of death for something serious
p282
aVbecause it makes it solemn.
p283
aVAnd what happened was
p284
aVthat New York City, to a degree,
p285
aVate my identity
p286
aVbecause people began to copy it.
p287
aVHere's an ad in the New York Times
p288
aVsomebody did for a play called "Mind Games."
p289
aVThen "Chicago" came out, used similar graphics,
p290
aVand the Public Theater's identity was just totally eaten and taken away,
p291
aVwhich meant I had to change it.
p292
aVSo, I changed it so that every season was different,
p293
aVand I continued to do these posters,
p294
aVbut they never had the seriousness
p295
aVof the first identity
p296
aVbecause they were too individual, and they didn't have that heft
p297
aVof everything being the same thing.
p298
aVNow \u2014 and I think since the Public Theater,
p299
aVI must have done more than a dozen
p300
aVcultural identities for major institutions,
p301
aVand I don't think I ever \u2014 I ever
p302
aVgrasped that seriousness again \u2014
p303
aVI do them for very big, important institutions
p304
aVin New York City.
p305
aa(lp306
VThe institutions are solemn,
p307
aVand so is the design.
p308
aVThey're better crafted than the Public Theater was,
p309
aVand they spend more money on them, but I think
p310
aVthat that moment comes and goes.
p311
aVThe best way to accomplish serious design \u2014
p312
aVwhich I think we all have the opportunity to do \u2014
p313
aVis to be totally and completely unqualified for the job.
p314
aVThat doesn't happen very often,
p315
aVbut it happened to me in the year 2000,
p316
aVwhen for some reason or another,
p317
aVa whole pile of different architects
p318
aVstarted to ask me to design
p319
aVthe insides of theaters with them,
p320
aVwhere I would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings.
p321
aVI'd never done this kind of work before.
p322
aVI didn't know how to read an architectural plan,
p323
aVI didn't know what they were talking about,
p324
aVand I really couldn't handle the fact that a job \u2014
p325
aVa single job \u2014 could go on for four years
p326
aVbecause I was used to immediacy in graphic design,
p327
aVand that kind of attention to detail
p328
aVwas really bad for somebody like me, with ADD.
p329
aa(lp330
VSo, it was a rough \u2014 it was a rough go,
p331
aVbut I fell in love with this process
p332
aVof actually integrating graphics into architecture
p333
aVbecause I didn't know what I was doing.
p334
aVI said, "Why can't the signage be on the floor?"
p335
aVNew Yorkers look at their feet.
p336
aVAnd then I found that actors and actresses
p337
aVactually take their cues from the floor,
p338
aVso it turned out that these sorts of sign systems
p339
aVbegan to make sense.
p340
aVThey integrated with the building in really peculiar ways.
p341
aVThey ran around corners,
p342
aVthey went up sides of buildings,
p343
aVand they melded into the architecture.
p344
aVThis is Symphony Space on 90th Street and Broadway,
p345
aVand the type is interwoven into the stainless steel
p346
aVand backlit with fiber optics.
p347
aVAnd the architect, Jim Polshek,
p348
aVessentially gave me a canvas
p349
aVto play typography out on.
p350
aVAnd it was serious play.
p351
aVThis is the children's museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
p352
aVmade out of completely inexpensive materials.
p353
aVExtruded typography that's backlit with neon.
p354
aVThings I never did before, built before.
p355
aVI just thought they'd be kind of fun to do.
p356
aVDonors' walls made out of Lucite.
p357
aVAnd then, inexpensive signage.
p358
aa(lp359
V(Laughter)
p360
aa(lp361
VI think my favorite of these
p362
aVwas this little job in Newark, New Jersey.
p363
aVIt's a performing arts school.
p364
aVThis is the building that \u2014 they had no money,
p365
aVand they had to recast it, and they said,
p366
aVif we give you 100,000 dollars, what can you do with it?
p367
aVAnd I did a little Photoshop job on it, and I said,
p368
aVWell, I think we can paint it.
p369
aVAnd we did. And it was play.
p370
aVAnd there's the building. Everything was painted \u2014
p371
aVtypography over the whole damn thing,
p372
aVincluding the air conditioning ducts.
p373
aVI hired guys who paint flats
p374
aVfixed on the sides of garages
p375
aVto do the painting on the building, and they loved it.
p376
aVThey got into it \u2014 they took the job incredibly seriously.
p377
aVThey used to climb up on the building and call me
p378
aVand tell me that they had to correct my typography \u2014
p379
aVthat my spacing was wrong, and they moved it,
p380
aVand they did wonderful things with it.
p381
aVThey were pretty serious, too. It was quite wonderful.
p382
aa(lp383
VBy the time I did Bloomberg's headquarters
p384
aVmy work had begun to become accepted.
p385
aVPeople wanted it in big, expensive places.
p386
aVAnd that began to make it solemn.
p387
aVBloomberg was all about numbers,
p388
aVand we did big numbers through the space
p389
aVand the numbers were projected on a spectacular LED
p390
aVthat my partner, Lisa Strausfeld, programmed.
p391
aVBut it became the end
p392
aVof the seriousness of the play,
p393
aVand it started to, once again, become solemn.
p394
aVThis is a current project
p395
aVin Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
p396
aVwhere I got to be goofy.
p397
aVI was invited to design
p398
aVa logo for this neighborhood, called the North Side,
p399
aVand I thought it was silly for a neighborhood to have a logo.
p400
aVI think that's rather creepy, actually. Why would a neighborhood have a logo?
p401
aVA neighborhood has a thing \u2014 it's got a landmark, it's got a place,
p402
aVit's got a restaurant. It doesn't have a logo. I mean, what would that be?
p403
aa(lp404
VSo I had to actually give a presentation
p405
aVto a city council
p406
aVand neighborhood constituents,
p407
aVand I went to Pittsburgh and I said,
p408
aV"You know, really what you have here
p409
aVare all these underpasses
p410
aVthat separate the neighborhood from the center of town.
p411
aVWhy don't you celebrate them, and make the underpasses landmarks?"
p412
aVSo I began doing this crazy presentation
p413
aVof these installations \u2014
p414
aVpotential installations \u2014 on
p415
aVthese underpass bridges,
p416
aVand stood up in front of the city council \u2014
p417
aVand was a little bit scared,
p418
aVI have to admit.
p419
aVBut I was so utterly unqualified for this project,
p420
aVand so utterly ridiculous,
p421
aVand ignored the brief so desperately
p422
aVthat I think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness,
p423
aVjust completely because it was so goofy to begin with.
p424
aVAnd this is the bridge they're actually
p425
aVpainting up and preparing as we speak.
p426
aVIt will change every six months, and it will become an art installation
p427
aVin the North Side of Pittsburgh,
p428
aVand it will probably become a landmark in the area.
p429
aa(lp430
VJohn Hockenberry told you a bit about
p431
aVmy travail with Citibank,
p432
aVthat is now a 10-year relationship, and I still work with them.
p433
aVAnd I actually am amused by them and like them,
p434
aVand think that as a very, very, very, very, very big corporation
p435
aVthey actually keep their graphics very nice.
p436
aVI drew the logo for Citibank
p437
aVon a napkin in the first meeting.
p438
aVThat was the play part of the job.
p439
aVAnd then I spent a year
p440
aVgoing to long, tedious,
p441
aVboring meetings,
p442
aVtrying to sell this logo through
p443
aVto a huge corporation
p444
aVto the point of tears.
p445
aVI thought I was going to go crazy at the end of this year.
p446
aVWe made idiotic presentations
p447
aVshowing how the Citi logo made sense,
p448
aVand how it was really derived from an umbrella,
p449
aVand we made animations of these things,
p450
aVand we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.
p451
aVAnd it was worth it, because they bought this thing,
p452
aVand it played out on such a grand scale,
p453
aVand it's so internationally recognizable,
p454
aVbut for me it was actually a very, very depressing year.
p455
aVAs a matter of fact, they actually never bought onto the logo
p456
aVuntil Fallon put it on
p457
aVits very good "Live Richly" campaign,
p458
aVand then everybody accepted it all over the world.
p459
aa(lp460
VSo during this time I needed
p461
aVsome kind of counterbalance
p462
aVfor this crazy, crazy existence
p463
aVof going to these long, idiotic meetings.
p464
aVAnd I was up in my country house,
p465
aVand for some reason, I began painting
p466
aVthese very big, very involved,
p467
aVlaborious, complicated
p468
aVmaps of the entire world,
p469
aVand listing every place on the planet, and putting them in,
p470
aVand misspelling them, and putting things in the wrong spot,
p471
aVand completely controlling the information,
p472
aVand going totally and completely nuts with it.
p473
aVThey would take me about six months initially,
p474
aVbut then I started getting faster at it.
p475
aVHere's the United States.
p476
aVEvery single city of the United States is on here.
p477
aVAnd it hung for about eight months
p478
aVat the Cooper-Hewitt, and people walked up to it,
p479
aVand they would point to a part of the map
p480
aVand they'd say, "Oh, I've been here."
p481
aVAnd, of course, they couldn't have been because it's in the wrong spot.
p482
aV(Laughter)
p483
aVBut what I liked about it was,
p484
aVI was controlling my own idiotic information,
p485
aVand I was creating my own palette of information,
p486
aVand I was totally and completely
p487
aVat play.
p488
aVOne of my favorites was
p489
aVthis painting I did of Florida after the 2000 election
p490
aVthat has the election results rolling around in the water.
p491
aVI keep that for evidence.
p492
aa(lp493
V(Laughter)
p494
aa(lp495
VSomebody
p496
aVwas up at my house and saw the paintings
p497
aVand recommended them to a gallery,
p498
aVand I had a first show
p499
aVabout two-and-a-half years ago, and I showed these paintings
p500
aVthat I'm showing you now.
p501
aVAnd then a funny thing happened \u2014 they sold.
p502
aVAnd they sold quickly,
p503
aVand became rather popular.
p504
aVWe started making prints from them.
p505
aVThis is Manhattan, one from the series.
p506
aVThis is a print from the United States which we did in red, white and blue.
p507
aVWe began doing these big silkscreen prints,
p508
aVand they started selling, too.
p509
aVSo, the gallery wanted me to have another show
p510
aVin two years,
p511
aVwhich meant that I really
p512
aVhad to paint these paintings
p513
aVmuch faster
p514
aVthan I had ever done them. And I \u2014
p515
aVthey started to become more political, and I picked areas
p516
aVthat sort of were in the news
p517
aVor that I had some feeling about,
p518
aVand I began doing these things.
p519
aa(lp520
VAnd then this funny thing happened.
p521
aVI found that I was no longer at play.
p522
aVI was actually in this solemn landscape
p523
aVof fulfilling an expectation
p524
aVfor a show,
p525
aVwhich is not where I started with these things.
p526
aVSo, while they became successful,
p527
aVI know how to make them,
p528
aVso I'm not a neophyte,
p529
aVand they're no longer serious \u2014
p530
aVthey have become solemn.
p531
aVAnd that's a terrifying factor \u2014
p532
aVwhen you start something and it turns that way \u2014
p533
aVbecause it means that all that's left for you
p534
aVis to go back and to find out
p535
aVwhat the next thing is that you can push,
p536
aVthat you can invent, that you can be ignorant about,
p537
aVthat you can be arrogant about,
p538
aVthat you can fail with,
p539
aVand that you can be a fool with.
p540
aVBecause in the end, that's how you grow,
p541
aVand that's all that matters.
p542
aa(lp543
VSo, I'm plugging along here \u2014
p544
aV(Laughter)
p545
aVand I'm just going to have to blow up the staircase.
p546
aVThank you very much.
