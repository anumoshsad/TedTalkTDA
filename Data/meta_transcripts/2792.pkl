VDamian Kulash: Thank you, thanks very much.
p103
aa(lp104
VWe are OK Go,
p105
aVand we've been together as a band since 1998.
p106
aVBut in the last decade,
p107
aVwe've become known as much for the elaborate music videos,
p108
aVlike the one we just saw,
p109
aVas for the songs they accompany.
p110
aVSo we will play along with another one of those in a few minutes,
p111
aVbut in the meantime,
p112
aVwe want to address this question that we get asked all the time
p113
aVbut we've really never come up with an adequate answer for it,
p114
aVand that is, how do we think of those ideas?
p115
aa(lp116
VThe videos are not all Rube Goldberg machines, by the way.
p117
aVLast year we did a dance in zero gravity,
p118
aVand once we set up an obstacle course
p119
aVout of thousands of musical instruments in the desert,
p120
aVand then played them by stunt driving a car through them.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VFor one of the videos,
p125
aVwe choreographed hundreds of people with umbrellas
p126
aVin an abandoned parking lot outside Tokyo,
p127
aVand then filmed them from a drone a half a mile in the air.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo it's all of these ideas that people are curious about,
p130
aVand the reason we've had so much trouble describing how we think of these ideas
p131
aVis that it doesn't really feel like we think of them at all.
p132
aVIt feels like we find them.
p133
aVAnd by way of explanation \u2014
p134
aVwell, I have a compulsive habit.
p135
aVI play parallax and perspective games with my eyes pretty much all the time,
p136
aVand it's something I've been doing since I was a teenager.
p137
aVAnd I think the big contributing factor may have been
p138
aVthat this is how I decorated my high school bedroom.
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd being a teenager,
p143
aVwhat I did in there, of course, was just talk on the phone
p144
aVfor staggering amounts of time.
p145
aVSo I was in this visual maelstrom
p146
aVjust pretty much usually sitting in one place,
p147
aVand I guess just the overload in general \u2014
p148
aVmy brain kind of tried to make sense of it, and I would \u2014
p149
aVIf I could move my head off to one side a little bit,
p150
aVthe edge of the desk would line up just perfectly
p151
aVwith that poster on the opposite wall;
p152
aVor if I put my thumb out,
p153
aVI could close first my left eye and then my right,
p154
aVand my thumb would bounce back and forth
p155
aVbetween Jimi Hendrix's left eye and his right.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VIt was not a conscious thing, of course,
p160
aVthis is just kind of the equivalent of doodling while you're talking,
p161
aVand it's still something I do all the time.
p162
aVThis is my wife, Kristin \u2014
p163
aa(lp164
V(Applause)
p165
aa(lp166
VYeah!
p167
aVWoo!
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd it's not uncommon that we are out at dinner,
p170
aVand in the middle of a great conversation she'll just stop mid-sentence,
p171
aVand when she stops is when I realize that I'm the one who's acting weird
p172
aVbecause I'm like bobbing and weaving.
p173
aVAnd what I'm trying to do is get that ficus back there
p174
aVto stick out of her head like a ponytail.
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VThe point of telling you all this is that \u2014
p179
aVfor me this is what it feels like to have an idea.
p180
aVIt's like they're made of these disparate parts,
p181
aVthese disparate chunks sort of floating out there.
p182
aVAnd if you're receptive and you're observant,
p183
aVand crucially, if you're in exactly the right place,
p184
aVyou can get them to just line up.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo if you get used to \u2014
p187
aVif it's your job to think of ideas this way,
p188
aVthey'll start beckoning to you
p189
aVthe way that Jimi's eyes beckoned from that poster,
p190
aVor the ficus beckons from behind Kristin's head.
p191
aVWriting music feels like that process just over and over again,
p192
aVlike you've got a bunch of sounds or a groove or a chord progression
p193
aVand you're just looking for that thing on the other side,
p194
aVthat little chunk over there, that puzzle piece that clicks right in.
p195
aVAnd when it does click,
p196
aVit doesn't feel like you thought up that puzzle piece,
p197
aVit feels like you found it \u2014
p198
aVlike it was a set of relationships that you unlocked.
p199
aa(lp200
VBut with the videos in particular,
p201
aVwe're usually looking for this specific feeling
p202
aVwhich is wonder.
p203
aVAnd there's always a component of surprise to wonder,
p204
aVso we're not just looking for good ideas,
p205
aVwe're looking for good ideas that surprise us in some way.
p206
aVAnd this causes something of a problem,
p207
aVbecause ...
p208
aVthe process that we all use to make stuff,
p209
aVit actually has a very strong bias against surprising ideas.
p210
aa(lp211
VThe process I'm talking about is the one you all know \u2014
p212
aVwe all do it all the time.
p213
aVYou think of an idea.
p214
aVYou just sit and think of your brilliant idea
p215
aVand then you come up with a plan
p216
aVfor how you're going to make that idea happen.
p217
aVAnd then with that plan in mind,
p218
aVyou go back and double-check your original idea
p219
aVand maybe revise it,
p220
aVand then bouncing back and forth between the idea and the plan,
p221
aVthe plan and the idea,
p222
aVeventually you come up with a truly great plan.
p223
aVAnd then once you have that, and only then,
p224
aVdo you go out and you execute.
p225
aVAnd this is like \u2014
p226
aVthis is sort of a flawless system
p227
aVin terms of maximizing your resources,
p228
aVbecause this \u2014 super cheap.
p229
aVThinking usually costs very little,
p230
aVbut this is really expensive most of the time,
p231
aVso by the time you get there,
p232
aVyou want to make sure you're super prepared
p233
aVand you can squeeze every last drop out of what you've got.
p234
aa(lp235
VBut there are problems with this,
p236
aVand math will help us reveal the biggest one.
p237
aVGo back to that video that we just showed you.
p238
aVThat Rube Goldberg machine,
p239
aVit had about 130 interactions in it.
p240
aVThat was 130 things
p241
aVthat we had to have go according to our plan.
p242
aVSo let's assume that we want to make a new video now,
p243
aVsimilarly complex \u2014 130 moving parts.
p244
aVIf we're really good planners in that system,
p245
aVit seems like maybe we could be good enough
p246
aVto get every part of that system to be 90 percent reliable.
p247
aV90 percent sounds good, right?
p248
aVWell, it's not.
p249
aVIt's terrible actually. The numbers say so.
p250
aVThe chance of getting all 130 things to not fail at the same time
p251
aVis .9 for 90 percent to the 130th power.
p252
aVSo calculate that out and you get ...
p253
aa(lp254
V(Ding)
p255
aa(lp256
V.000001,
p257
aVwhich is one ten-thousandth of one percent,
p258
aVso your chance for success is literally one in a million.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Whistle)
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VI mean that's not a gamble I want to take,
p265
aVso let's ratchet up that reliability to 99 percent.
p266
aV.99 to the 130th power is ...
p267
aa(lp268
V(Ding)
p269
aa(lp270
V.27 \u2014 27 percent.
p271
aVSignificantly less daunting \u2014
p272
aVlike this might even be usable.
p273
aVBut really think about that.
p274
aVHow many parts of your lives are 99 percent reliable?
p275
aVAnd could you really get 130 of them all in one place at once?
p276
aVAnd if you really could,
p277
aVdoesn't it seem like you deserve to succeed?
p278
aVLike that is \u2014
p279
aVthat thing is going to work, right?
p280
aVBut no, it actually fails three times more often than it succeeds.
p281
aa(lp282
VSo the upshot of all this
p283
aVis that if your project is pretty complex \u2014
p284
aVlike, you know, every ambitious project is \u2014
p285
aVif you've got a lot of moving parts,
p286
aVyou're basically constrained to just reshuffling ideas
p287
aVthat have already demonstrably proven that they're 100 percent reliable.
p288
aVSo now go back to me sitting with my thumb in the air
p289
aVtrying to line up something surprising.
p290
aVIf the only things I'm allowed to consider in the first place
p291
aVare ideas that have already been done over and over and over again,
p292
aVI am screwed.
p293
aVHowever, there are ways around this,
p294
aVbecause we all know that there are tons of untried ideas still out there,
p295
aVand plenty of them will turn out to be every bit as reliable as we need,
p296
aVit's just that we don't yet know they are reliable
p297
aVwhen we are at this planning phase.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo what we do is we try to identify some place
p300
aVwhere there might just be a ton of those untried ideas.
p301
aVWe try to find a sandbox
p302
aVand then we gamble a whole bunch of our resources
p303
aVon getting in that sandbox and playing.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Laughter)
p306
aa(lp307
VBecause we have to trust that it's the process in the sandbox
p308
aVthat will reveal to us which ideas are not only surprising,
p309
aVbut surprisingly reliable.
p310
aa(lp311
VSo some of the sandboxes that we've started videos with.
p312
aVLet's play with optical illusions.
p313
aVLet's try to dance on moving surfaces.
p314
aVLet's try to make toast with a laser cutter.
p315
aVOr let's do something in one of those zero-gravity airplanes.
p316
aVBut then instead of actually trying to sit there
p317
aVand think out what that something is,
p318
aVwe spent a full third of our budget getting in an actual Vomit Comet
p319
aVand bouncing off the walls for a week.
p320
aa(lp321
VSo this may seem to you like testing,
p322
aVbut it really isn't,
p323
aVbecause at this point we don't yet know what our idea is,
p324
aVwe don't have a plan to be testing.
p325
aVSo we're just \u2014
p326
aVwe're just playing,
p327
aVwe're just trying everything we can think of,
p328
aVbecause we need to get this idea space filled up with a chaos
p329
aVlike the one in my high school bedroom.
p330
aVBecause then, if we can do the bob and weave thing,
p331
aVif we can put our thumbs up and get just a few things to line up \u2014
p332
aa(lp333
V(Ding)
p334
aa(lp335
Vchances are no one else has ever made those same things line up before.
p336
aVAnd when we're done with that project,
p337
aVpeople will ask us again how we thought of that idea,
p338
aVand we'll be stumped, because from our perspective,
p339
aVit doesn't feel like we thought of it at all,
p340
aVit just feels like we found it.
p341
aa(lp342
VSo we'll play another video for you now and the song along with it.
p343
aVThis is for the song "The One Moment,"
p344
aVand for this one, the sandbox was ballistics and math.
p345
aVSo I spent a full month putting together a giant spreadsheet for this.
p346
aVIt was like my playspace was 400 lines long
p347
aVand 25 columns wide \u2014
p348
aVwhich I presume that if anybody is going to understand that, it's this crowd.
p349
aa(lp350
V(Laughter)
p351
aa(lp352
VNothing is better than a giant spreadsheet, right?
p353
aa(lp354
V(Laughter)
p355
aa(lp356
VWell, thank you everyone, very much.
p357
aVWe are OK Go,
p358
aVand this is called "The One Moment."
p359
aa(lp360
