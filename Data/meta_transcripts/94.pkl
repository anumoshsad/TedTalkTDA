(lp3
VIt's wonderful to be back.
p4
aVI love this wonderful gathering.
p5
aVAnd you must be wondering, "What on earth?
p6
aVHave they put up the wrong slide?"
p7
aVNo, no.
p8
aVLook at this magnificent beast,
p9
aVand ask the question: Who designed it?
p10
aa(lp11
VThis is TED; this is Technology, Entertainment, Design,
p12
aVand there's a dairy cow.
p13
aVIt's a quite wonderfully designed animal.
p14
aVAnd I was thinking, how do I introduce this?
p15
aVAnd I thought, well, maybe that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer,
p16
aVyou know: "Poems are made by fools like me, but only God can make a tree."
p17
aVAnd you might say, "Well, God designed the cow."
p18
aa(lp19
VBut, of course, God got a lot of help.
p20
aVThis is the ancestor of cattle.
p21
aVThis is the aurochs.
p22
aVAnd it was designed by natural selection,
p23
aVthe process of natural selection, over many millions of years.
p24
aVAnd then it became domesticated, thousands of years ago.
p25
aVAnd human beings became its stewards,
p26
aVand, without even knowing what they were doing,
p27
aVthey gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it.
p28
aVAnd then more recently, they really began to do reverse engineering on this beast
p29
aVand figure out just what the parts were, how they worked
p30
aVand how they might be optimized \u2014 how they might be made better.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow, why am I talking about cows?
p33
aVBecause I want to say that much the same thing is true of religions.
p34
aVReligions are natural phenomena \u2014 they're just as natural as cows.
p35
aVThey have evolved over millennia.
p36
aVThey have a biological base, just like the aurochs.
p37
aVThey have become domesticated,
p38
aVand human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years.
p39
aVThis is TED, and I want to talk about design.
p40
aVBecause what I've been doing for the last four years \u2014
p41
aVreally since the first time you saw me \u2014
p42
aVsome of you saw me at TED when I was talking about religion \u2014
p43
aVand in the last four years,
p44
aVI've been working just about non-stop on this topic.
p45
aVAnd you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions.
p46
aVNow that very idea, I think, strikes terror in many people,
p47
aVor anger, or anxiety of one sort or another.
p48
aVAnd that is the spell that I want to break.
p49
aa(lp50
VI want to say, no, religions are an important natural phenomenon.
p51
aVWe should study them with the same intensity
p52
aVthat we study all the other important natural phenomena,
p53
aVlike global warming, as we heard so eloquently last night from Al Gore.
p54
aVToday's religions are brilliantly designed \u2014 brilliantly designed.
p55
aVThey are immensely powerful social institutions
p56
aVand many of their features can be traced back to earlier features
p57
aVthat we can really make sense of by reverse engineering.
p58
aVAnd, as with the cow, there's a mixture of evolutionary design \u2014
p59
aVdesigned by natural selection itself \u2014
p60
aVand intelligent design \u2014
p61
aVmore or less intelligent design \u2014
p62
aVand redesigned by human beings
p63
aVwho are trying to redesign their religions.
p64
aa(lp65
VYou don't do book talks at TED,
p66
aVbut I'm going to have just one slide about my book,
p67
aVbecause there is one message in it
p68
aVwhich I think this group really needs to hear.
p69
aVAnd I would be very interested to get your responses to this.
p70
aVIt's the one policy proposal that I make in the book,
p71
aVat this time, when I claim not to know enough about religion
p72
aVto know what other policy proposals to make.
p73
aVAnd it's one that echoes remarks that you've heard already today.
p74
aa(lp75
VHere's my proposal,
p76
aVI'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it:
p77
aVEducation on world religions for all of our children \u2014
p78
aVin primary school, in high school,
p79
aVin public schools, in private schools and in home schooling.
p80
aVSo what I'm proposing is,
p81
aVjust as we require reading, writing, arithmetic, American history,
p82
aVso we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world \u2014
p83
aVabout their history, about their creeds, about their texts,
p84
aVtheir music, their symbolisms, their prohibitions, their requirements.
p85
aVAnd this should be presented factually, straightforwardly,
p86
aVwith no particular spin, to all of the children in the country.
p87
aVAnd as long as you teach them that,
p88
aVyou can teach them anything else you like.
p89
aVThat, I think, is maximal tolerance for religious freedom.
p90
aVAs long as you inform your children about other religions,
p91
aVthen you may \u2014 and as early as you like and whatever you like \u2014
p92
aVteach them whatever creed you want them to learn.
p93
aVBut also let them know about other religions.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, why do I say that?
p96
aVBecause democracy depends on an informed citizenship.
p97
aVInformed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy.
p98
aVMisinformed consent is not worth it.
p99
aVIt's like a coin flip; it doesn't count, really.
p100
aVDemocracy depends on informed consent.
p101
aVThis is the way we treat people as responsible adults.
p102
aVNow, children below the age of consent are a special case.
p103
aVParents \u2014 I'm going to use a word that Pastor Rick just used \u2014
p104
aVparents are stewards of their children.
p105
aVThey don't own them.
p106
aVYou can't own your children.
p107
aVYou have a responsibility to the world,
p108
aVto the state, to them, to take care of them right.
p109
aVYou may teach them whatever creed you think is most important,
p110
aVbut I say you have a responsibility to let them be informed
p111
aVabout all the other creeds in the world, too.
p112
aa(lp113
VThe reason I've taken this time is I've been fascinated to hear
p114
aVsome of the reactions to this.
p115
aVOne reviewer for a Roman Catholic newspaper called it "totalitarian."
p116
aVIt strikes me as practically libertarian.
p117
aVIs it totalitarian to require reading, writing and arithmetic?
p118
aVI don't think so.
p119
aVAll I'm saying is \u2014
p120
aVand facts, facts only; no values, just facts \u2014
p121
aVabout all the world's religions.
p122
aVAnother reviewer called it "hilarious."
p123
aVWell, I'm really bothered by the fact
p124
aVthat anybody would think that was hilarious.
p125
aVIt seems to me to be such a plausible,
p126
aVnatural extension of the democratic principles we already have
p127
aVthat I'm shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous.
p128
aVI know many religions
p129
aVare so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children
p130
aVthat they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths.
p131
aVI don't think that's defensible.
p132
aVBut I'd really be pleased to get your answers on that \u2014
p133
aVany reactions to that \u2014 later.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut now I'm going to move on.
p136
aVBack to the cow.
p137
aVThis picture, which I pulled off the web \u2014
p138
aVthe fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture.
p139
aVThat's the steward.
p140
aVCows couldn't live without human stewards \u2014 they're domesticated.
p141
aVThey're a sort of ectosymbiont.
p142
aVThey depend on us for their survival.
p143
aVAnd Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep.
p144
aVI'm going to talk about sheep, too.
p145
aVThere's a lot of serendipitous convergence here.
p146
aVHow clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds!
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VThink of what this got them.
p151
aVThey could outsource all their problems:
p152
aVprotection from predators, food-finding ...
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
V... health maintenance.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VThe only cost in most flocks \u2014 not even this \u2014 a loss of free mating.
p161
aVWhat a deal!
p162
aV"How clever of sheep!" you might say.
p163
aVExcept, of course, it wasn't the sheep's cleverness.
p164
aVWe all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists \u2014 they're not very smart.
p165
aVIt wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all.
p166
aVThey were clueless.
p167
aVBut it was a very clever move.
p168
aVWhose clever move was it?
p169
aVIt was the clever move of natural selection itself.
p170
aa(lp171
VFrancis Crick, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA
p172
aVwith Jim Watson,
p173
aVonce joked about what he called Orgel's Second Rule.
p174
aVLeslie Orgel is a molecular biologist, brilliant guy,
p175
aVand Orgel's Second Rule is:
p176
aVEvolution is cleverer than you are.
p177
aVNow, that is not Intelligent Design \u2014 not from Francis Crick.
p178
aVEvolution is cleverer than you are.
p179
aVIf you understand Orgel's Second Rule, then you understand
p180
aVwhy the Intelligent Design movement is basically a hoax.
p181
aa(lp182
VThe designs discovered by the process of natural selection
p183
aVare brilliant, unbelievably brilliant.
p184
aVAgain and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered.
p185
aVBut the process itself is without purpose,
p186
aVwithout foresight, without design.
p187
aVWhen I was here four years ago,
p188
aVI told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass.
p189
aVAnd why the ant was doing it was because its brain had been infected
p190
aVwith a lancet fluke that was needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow
p191
aVin order to reproduce.
p192
aVSo it was sort of a spooky story.
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd I think some people may have misunderstood.
p195
aVLancet flukes aren't smart.
p196
aVI submit that the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there,
p197
aVsomewhere between petunia and carrot.
p198
aVThey're not really bright. They don't have to be.
p199
aVThe lesson we learn from this is:
p200
aVyou don't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary.
p201
aVThe design is there in nature, but it's not in anybody's head.
p202
aVIt doesn't have to be.
p203
aVThat's the way evolution works.
p204
aVQuestion: Was domestication good for sheep?
p205
aVIt was great for their genetic fitness.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd here I want to remind you of a wonderful point
p208
aVthat Paul MacCready made at TED three years ago.
p209
aVHere's what he said:
p210
aV"Ten thousand years ago, at the dawn of agriculture,
p211
aVhuman population, plus livestock and pets,
p212
aVwas approximately a tenth of one percent of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass."
p213
aVThat was just 10,000 years ago.
p214
aVYesterday, in biological terms.
p215
aVWhat is it today? Does anybody remember what he told us?
p216
aV98 percent.
p217
aVThat is what we have done on this planet.
p218
aa(lp219
VNow, I talked to Paul afterwards \u2014 I wanted to check to find out
p220
aVhow he'd calculated this, and get the sources and so forth \u2014
p221
aVand he also gave me a paper that he had written on this.
p222
aVAnd there was a passage in it which he did not present here
p223
aVand I think it is so good, I'm going to read it to you:
p224
aV"Over billions of years on a unique sphere,
p225
aVchance has painted a thin covering of life:
p226
aVcomplex, improbable, wonderful and fragile.
p227
aVSuddenly, we humans \u2014 a recently arrived species
p228
aVno longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature \u2014
p229
aVhave grown in population, technology and intelligence
p230
aVto a position of terrible power.
p231
aVWe now wield the paintbrush."
p232
aVWe heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish.
p233
aVLife itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet.
p234
aVAnd we're the ones that hold the paintbrush.
p235
aVAnd how can we do that?
p236
aa(lp237
VThe key to our domination of the planet is culture.
p238
aVAnd the key to culture is religion.
p239
aVSuppose Martian scientists came to Earth.
p240
aVThey would be puzzled by many things.
p241
aVAnybody know what this is? I'll tell you what it is.
p242
aVThis is a million people gathering on the banks of the Ganges in 2001,
p243
aVperhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever,
p244
aVas seen from satellite photograph.
p245
aVHere's a big crowd.
p246
aVHere's another crowd in Mecca.
p247
aVMartians would be amazed by this.
p248
aVThey'd want to know how it originated,
p249
aVwhat it was for and how it perpetuates itself.
p250
aa(lp251
VActually, I'm going to pass over this.
p252
aVThe ant isn't alone.
p253
aVThere's all sorts of wonderful cases of species which \u2014 in that case \u2014
p254
aVA parasite gets into a mouse and needs to get into the belly of a cat.
p255
aVAnd it turns the mouse into Mighty Mouse, makes it fearless,
p256
aVso it runs out in the open, where it'll be eaten by a cat.
p257
aVTrue story.
p258
aVIn other words, we have these hijackers \u2014
p259
aVyou've seen this slide before, from four years ago \u2014
p260
aVa parasite that infects the brain and induces even suicidal behavior,
p261
aVon behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness.
p262
aa(lp263
VDoes that ever happen to us?
p264
aVYes, it does \u2014 quite wonderfully.
p265
aVThe Arabic word "Islam" means "submission."
p266
aVIt means "surrender of self-interest to the will of Allah."
p267
aVBut I'm not just talking about Islam.
p268
aVI'm talking also about Christianity.
p269
aVThis is a parchment music page that I found in a Paris bookstall
p270
aV50 years ago.
p271
aVAnd on it, it says, in Latin:
p272
aV"Semen est verbum Dei. Sator autem Christus."
p273
aVThe word of God is the seed and the sower of the seed is Christ.
p274
aVSame idea. Well, not quite.
p275
aVBut in fact, Christians, too ...
p276
aVglory in the fact that they have surrendered to God.
p277
aVI'll give you a few quotes.
p278
aV"The heart of worship is surrender.
p279
aVSurrendered people obey God's words, even if it doesn't make sense."
p280
aVThose words are by Rick Warren.
p281
aVThose are from "The Purpose Driven Life."
p282
aa(lp283
VAnd I want to turn now, briefly, to talk about that book, which I've read.
p284
aVYou've all got a copy,
p285
aVand you've just heard the man.
p286
aVAnd what I want to do now is say a bit about this book
p287
aVfrom the design standpoint,
p288
aVbecause I think it's actually a brilliant book.
p289
aVFirst of all, the goal \u2014 and you heard just now what the goal is \u2014
p290
aVit's to bring purpose to the lives of millions, and he has succeeded.
p291
aVIs it a good goal? In itself, I'm sure we all agree, it is a wonderful goal.
p292
aVHe's absolutely right.
p293
aVThere are lots of people out there who don't have purpose in their life,
p294
aVand bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal.
p295
aVI give him an A+ on this.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VIs the goal achieved?
p300
aVYes.
p301
aVThirty million copies of this book.
p302
aVAl Gore, eat your heart out.
p303
aa(lp304
V(Laughter)
p305
aa(lp306
VJust exactly what Al is trying to do, Rick is doing.
p307
aVThis is a fantastic achievement.
p308
aVAnd the means \u2014 how does he do it?
p309
aa(lp310
VIt's a brilliant redesign of traditional religious themes \u2014
p311
aVupdating them, quietly dropping obsolete features,
p312
aVputting new interpretations on other features.
p313
aVThis is the evolution of religion that's been going on for thousands of years,
p314
aVand he's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it.
p315
aVI don't have to tell you this; you just heard the man.
p316
aVExcellent insights into human psychology, wise advice on every page.
p317
aVMoreover, he invites us to look under the hood.
p318
aVI really appreciated that.
p319
aVFor instance, he has an appendix where he explains
p320
aVhis choice of translations of different Bible verses.
p321
aVThe book is clear, vivid, accessible, beautifully formatted.
p322
aVJust enough repetition.
p323
aVThat's really important.
p324
aVEvery time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.
p325
aVEvery time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.
p326
aa(lp327
V(Laughter)
p328
aa(lp329
VWith me, everybody \u2014
p330
aa(lp331
V(Audience and Dan Dennett) Every time you read it or say it,
p332
aVyou make another copy in your brain.
p333
aa(lp334
VThank you.
p335
aa(lp336
VAnd now we come to my problem.
p337
aVBecause I'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation
p338
aVof all that I said about this book.
p339
aVBut I wish it were better.
p340
aVI have some problems with the book.
p341
aVAnd it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems.
p342
aVI wish he could do this with a revision,
p343
aVa Mark 2 version of his book.
p344
aV"The truth will set you free."
p345
aVThat's what it says in the Bible,
p346
aVand it's something that I want to live by, too.
p347
aa(lp348
VMy problem is, some of the bits in it I don't think are true.
p349
aVNow some of this is a difference of opinion.
p350
aVAnd that's not my main complaint, that's worth mentioning.
p351
aVHere's a passage \u2014 it's very much what he said, anyway:
p352
aV"If there was no God we would all be accidents,
p353
aVthe result of astronomical random chance in the Universe.
p354
aVYou could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose
p355
aVor meaning or significance.
p356
aVThere would be no right or wrong
p357
aVand no hope beyond your brief years on Earth."
p358
aVNow, I just do not believe that.
p359
aVBy the way, I find \u2014 Homer Groening's film presented a beautiful alternative
p360
aVto that very claim.
p361
aVYes, there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong.
p362
aVWe don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us.
p363
aVBut that, as I said, is just a difference of opinion.
p364
aVThat's not what I'm really worried about.
p365
aa(lp366
VHow about this: "God designed this planet's environment
p367
aVjust so we could live in it."
p368
aVI'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean
p369
aVthat we don't have to do the sorts of things
p370
aVthat Al Gore is trying so hard to get us to do.
p371
aVI am not happy with that sentiment at all.
p372
aVAnd then I find this: "All the evidence available in the biological sciences
p373
aVsupports the core proposition that the cosmos is a specially designed whole
p374
aVwith life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose,
p375
aVa whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning
p376
aVand explanation in this central fact."
p377
aVWell, that's Michael Denton. He's a creationist.
p378
aVAnd here, I think, "Wait a minute." I read this again.
p379
aVI read it three or four times and I think,
p380
aV"Is he really endorsing Intelligent Design?
p381
aVIs he endorsing creationism here?"
p382
aVAnd you can't tell.
p383
aVSo I'm sort of thinking, "Well, I don't know,
p384
aVI don't know if I want to get upset with this yet."
p385
aa(lp386
VBut then I read on, and I read this: "First, Noah had never seen rain,
p387
aVbecause prior to the Flood, God irrigated the earth from the ground up."
p388
aVI wish that sentence weren't in there, because I think it is false.
p389
aVAnd I think that thinking this way about the history of the planet,
p390
aVafter we've just been hearing about the history of the planet
p391
aVover millions of years,
p392
aVdiscourages people from scientific understanding.
p393
aVNow, Rick Warren uses scientific terms
p394
aVand scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way.
p395
aa(lp396
VHere's one: "God deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him
p397
aVin a way that makes your ministry unique.
p398
aVHe carefully mixed the DNA cocktail that created you."
p399
aVI think that's false.
p400
aVNow, maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical.
p401
aVHere's another one: "For instance, your brain can store 100 trillion facts.
p402
aVYour mind can handle 15,000 decisions a second."
p403
aVWell, it would be interesting to find the interpretation
p404
aVwhere I would accept that.
p405
aVThere might be some way of treating that as true.
p406
aV"Anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge,
p407
aVhardwired by God into the very fiber of our being \u2014
p408
aVan inbuilt need to connect with God."
p409
aVWell, the sense of which I agree with him,
p410
aVexcept I think it has an evolutionary explanation.
p411
aa(lp412
VAnd what I find deeply troubling in this book
p413
aVis that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral,
p414
aVif you want to have meaning in your life,
p415
aVyou have to be an Intelligent Designer,
p416
aVyou have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection.
p417
aVAnd I think, on the contrary,
p418
aVthat it is very important to solving the world's problems
p419
aVthat we take evolutionary biology seriously.
p420
aVWhose truth are we going to listen to?
p421
aVWell, this is from "The Purpose Driven Life":
p422
aV"The Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life:
p423
aVthe compass I rely on for direction,
p424
aVthe counsel I listen to for making wise decisions,
p425
aVand the benchmark I use for evaluating everything."
p426
aVWell maybe, OK, but what's going to follow from this?
p427
aa(lp428
VAnd here's one that does concern me.
p429
aVRemember I quoted him before with this line:
p430
aV"Surrendered people obey God's word, even if it doesn't make sense."
p431
aVAnd that's a problem.

V"Don't ever argue with the Devil.
p436
aVHe's better at arguing than you are,
p437
aVhaving had thousands of years to practice."
p438
aVNow, Rick Warren didn't invent this clever move.
p439
aVIt's an old move.
p440
aVIt's a very clever adaptation of religions.
p441
aVIt's a wild card for disarming any reasonable criticism.
p442
aV"You don't like my interpretation?
p443
aVYou've got a reasonable objection to it?
p444
aVDon't listen, don't listen!
p445
aVThat's the Devil speaking."
p446
aVThis discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship
p447
aVit seems to me that we want to have.
p448
aa(lp449
VI've got one more problem, then I'm through.
p450
aVAnd I'd really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it.
p451
aV"In the Great Commission, Jesus said,
p452
aV'Go to all people of all nations and make them my disciples.
p453
aVBaptize them in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit,
p454
aVand teach them to do everything I've told you.'"
p455
aVThe Bible says Jesus is the only one who can save the world.
p456
aVWe've seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so.
p457
aVHere's one, not as beautiful as the others;
p458
aVit simply shows the religions of the world.
p459
aVHere's one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions.
p460
aa(lp461
VDo we really want to commit ourselves
p462
aVto engulfing all the other religions,
p463
aVwhen their holy books are telling them,
p464
aV"Don't listen to the other side, that's just Satan talking!"?
p465
aVIt seems to me that that's a very problematic ship
p466
aVto get on for the future.
p467
aVI found this sign as I was driving to Maine recently,
p468
aVin front of a church: "Good without God becomes zero."
p469
aVSort of cute.
p470
aVA very clever little meme.
p471
aVI don't believe it and I think this idea, popular as it is \u2014
p472
aVnot in this guise, but in general \u2014
p473
aVis itself one of the main problems that we face.
p474
aa(lp475
VIf you are like me, you know many wonderful, committed, engaged
p476
aVatheists, agnostics, who are being very good without God.
p477
aVAnd you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanctity
p478
aVinstead of doing good works.
p479
aVSo, I wish we could drop this meme.
p480
aVI wish this meme would go extinct.
p481
