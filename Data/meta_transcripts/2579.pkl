VI'm here today to talk about the two ideas that,
p4
aVat least based on my observations at Khan Academy,
p5
aVare kind of the core, or the key leverage points for learning.
p6
aVAnd it's the idea of mastery
p7
aVand the idea of mindset.
p8
aa(lp9
VI saw this in the early days working with my cousins.
p10
aVA lot of them were having trouble with math at first,
p11
aVbecause they had all of these gaps accumulated in their learning.
p12
aVAnd because of that, at some point they got to an algebra class
p13
aVand they might have been a little bit shaky on some of the pre-algebra,
p14
aVand because of that, they thought they didn't have the math gene.
p15
aVOr they'd get to a calculus class,
p16
aVand they'd be a little bit shaky on the algebra.
p17
aVI saw it in the early days
p18
aVwhen I was uploading some of those videos on YouTube,
p19
aVand I realized that people who were not my cousins were watching.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd at first, those comments were just simple thank-yous.
p24
aVI thought that was a pretty big deal.
p25
aVI don't know how much time you all spend on YouTube.
p26
aVMost of the comments are not "Thank you."
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VThey're a little edgier than that.
p31
aVBut then the comments got a little more intense,
p32
aVstudent after student saying that they had grown up not liking math.
p33
aVIt was getting difficult as they got into more advanced math topics.
p34
aVBy the time they got to algebra,
p35
aVthey had so many gaps in their knowledge they couldn't engage with it.
p36
aVThey thought they didn't have the math gene.
p37
aVBut when they were a bit older,
p38
aVthey took a little agency and decided to engage.
p39
aVThey found resources like Khan Academy
p40
aVand they were able to fill in those gaps and master those concepts,
p41
aVand that reinforced their mindset that it wasn't fixed;
p42
aVthat they actually were capable of learning mathematics.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd in a lot of ways, this is how you would master a lot of things in life.
p45
aVIt's the way you would learn a martial art.
p46
aVIn a martial art, you would practice the white belt skills
p47
aVas long as necessary,
p48
aVand only when you've mastered it
p49
aVyou would move on to become a yellow belt.
p50
aVIt's the way you learn a musical instrument:
p51
aVyou practice the basic piece over and over again,
p52
aVand only when you've mastered it,
p53
aVyou go on to the more advanced one.
p54
aa(lp55
VBut what we point out \u2014
p56
aVthis is not the way a traditional academic model is structured,
p57
aVthe type of academic model that most of us grew up in.
p58
aVIn a traditional academic model,
p59
aVwe group students together, usually by age,
p60
aVand around middle school,
p61
aVby age and perceived ability,
p62
aVand we shepherd them all together at the same pace.
p63
aVAnd what typically happens,
p64
aVlet's say we're in a middle school pre-algebra class,
p65
aVand the current unit is on exponents,
p66
aVthe teacher will give a lecture on exponents,
p67
aVthen we'll go home, do some homework.
p68
aVThe next morning, we'll review the homework,
p69
aVthen another lecture, homework, lecture, homework.
p70
aVThat will continue for about two or three weeks,
p71
aVand then we get a test.
p72
aVOn that test, maybe I get a 75 percent,
p73
aVmaybe you get a 90 percent,
p74
aVmaybe you get a 95 percent.
p75
aVAnd even though the test identified gaps in our knowledge,
p76
aVI didn't know 25 percent of the material.
p77
aVEven the A student, what was the five percent they didn't know?
p78
aa(lp79
VEven though we've identified the gaps,
p80
aVthe whole class will then move on to the next subject,
p81
aVprobably a more advanced subject that's going to build on those gaps.
p82
aVIt might be logarithms or negative exponents.
p83
aVAnd that process continues, and you immediately start to realize
p84
aVhow strange this is.
p85
aVI didn't know 25 percent of the more foundational thing,
p86
aVand now I'm being pushed to the more advanced thing.
p87
aVAnd this will continue for months, years, all the way until at some point,
p88
aVI might be in an algebra class or trigonometry class
p89
aVand I hit a wall.
p90
aVAnd it's not because algebra is fundamentally difficult
p91
aVor because the student isn't bright.
p92
aVIt's because I'm seeing an equation and they're dealing with exponents
p93
aVand that 30 percent that I didn't know is showing up.
p94
aVAnd then I start to disengage.
p95
aa(lp96
VTo appreciate how absurd that is,
p97
aVimagine if we did other things in our life that way.
p98
aVSay, home-building.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VSo we bring in the contractor and say,
p103
aV"We were told we have two weeks to build a foundation.
p104
aVDo what you can."
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VSo they do what they can.
p109
aVMaybe it rains.
p110
aVMaybe some of the supplies don't show up.
p111
aVAnd two weeks later, the inspector comes, looks around,
p112
aVsays, "OK, the concrete is still wet right over there,
p113
aVthat part's not quite up to code ...
p114
aVI'll give it an 80 percent."
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
VYou say, "Great! That's a C. Let's build the first floor."
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VSame thing.
p123
aVWe have two weeks, do what you can, inspector shows up, it's a 75 percent.
p124
aVGreat, that's a D-plus.
p125
aVSecond floor, third floor,
p126
aVand all of a sudden, while you're building the third floor,
p127
aVthe whole structure collapses.
p128
aVAnd if your reaction is the reaction you typically have in education,
p129
aVor that a lot of folks have,
p130
aVyou might say, maybe we had a bad contractor,
p131
aVor maybe we needed better inspection or more frequent inspection.
p132
aVBut what was really broken was the process.
p133
aVWe were artificially constraining how long we had to something,
p134
aVpretty much ensuring a variable outcome,
p135
aVand we took the trouble of inspecting and identifying those gaps,
p136
aVbut then we built right on top of it.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo the idea of mastery learning is to do the exact opposite.
p139
aVInstead of artificially constraining, fixing
p140
aVwhen and how long you work on something,
p141
aVpretty much ensuring that variable outcome,
p142
aVthe A, B, C, D, F \u2014
p143
aVdo it the other way around.
p144
aVWhat's variable is when and how long
p145
aVa student actually has to work on something,
p146
aVand what's fixed is that they actually master the material.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd it's important to realize
p149
aVthat not only will this make the student learn their exponents better,
p150
aVbut it'll reinforce the right mindset muscles.
p151
aVIt makes them realize that if you got 20 percent wrong on something,
p152
aVit doesn't mean that you have a C branded in your DNA somehow.
p153
aVIt means that you should just keep working on it.
p154
aVYou should have grit; you should have perseverance;
p155
aVyou should take agency over your learning.
p156
aa(lp157
VNow, a lot of skeptics might say, well, hey, this is all great,
p158
aVphilosophically, this whole idea of mastery-based learning
p159
aVand its connection to mindset,
p160
aVstudents taking agency over their learning.
p161
aVIt makes a lot of sense, but it seems impractical.
p162
aVTo actually do it, every student would be on their own track.
p163
aVIt would have to be personalized,
p164
aVyou'd have to have private tutors and worksheets for every student.
p165
aVAnd these aren't new ideas \u2014
p166
aVthere were experiments in Winnetka, Illinois, 100 years ago,
p167
aVwhere they did mastery-based learning and saw great results,
p168
aVbut they said it wouldn't scale because it was logistically difficult.
p169
aVThe teacher had to give different worksheets to every student,
p170
aVgive on-demand assessments.
p171
aa(lp172
VBut now today, it's no longer impractical.
p173
aVWe have the tools to do it.
p174
aVStudents see an explanation at their own time and pace?
p175
aVThere's on-demand video for that.
p176
aVThey need practice? They need feedback?
p177
aVThere's adaptive exercises readily available for students.
p178
aa(lp179
VAnd when that happens, all sorts of neat things happen.
p180
aVOne, the students can actually master the concepts,
p181
aVbut they're also building their growth mindset,
p182
aVthey're building grit, perseverance,
p183
aVthey're taking agency over their learning.
p184
aVAnd all sorts of beautiful things can start to happen
p185
aVin the actual classroom.
p186
aVInstead of it being focused on the lecture,
p187
aVstudents can interact with each other.
p188
aVThey can get deeper mastery over the material.
p189
aVThey can go into simulations, Socratic dialogue.
p190
aa(lp191
VTo appreciate what we're talking about
p192
aVand the tragedy of lost potential here,
p193
aVI'd like to give a little bit of a thought experiment.
p194
aVIf we were to go 400 years into the past to Western Europe,
p195
aVwhich even then, was one of the more literate parts of the planet,
p196
aVyou would see that about 15 percent of the population knew how to read.
p197
aVAnd I suspect that if you asked someone who did know how to read,
p198
aVsay a member of the clergy,
p199
aV"What percentage of the population do you think is even capable of reading?"
p200
aVThey might say, "Well, with a great education system,
p201
aVmaybe 20 or 30 percent."
p202
aVBut if you fast forward to today,
p203
aVwe know that that prediction would have been wildly pessimistic,
p204
aVthat pretty close to 100 percent of the population is capable of reading.
p205
aVBut if I were to ask you a similar question:
p206
aV"What percentage of the population do you think is capable
p207
aVof truly mastering calculus,
p208
aVor understanding organic chemistry,
p209
aVor being able to contribute to cancer research?"
p210
aVA lot of you might say, "Well, with a great education system,
p211
aVmaybe 20, 30 percent."
p212
aa(lp213
VBut what if that estimate
p214
aVis just based on your own experience in a non-mastery framework,
p215
aVyour own experience with yourself or observing your peers,
p216
aVwhere you're being pushed at this set pace through classes,
p217
aVaccumulating all these gaps?
p218
aVEven when you got that 95 percent,
p219
aVwhat was that five percent you missed?
p220
aVAnd it keeps accumulating \u2014 you get to an advanced class,
p221
aVall of a sudden you hit a wall and say,
p222
aV"I'm not meant to be a cancer researcher;
p223
aVnot meant to be a physicist; not meant to be a mathematician."
p224
aVI suspect that that actually is the case,
p225
aVbut if you were allowed to be operating in a mastery framework,
p226
aVif you were allowed to really take agency over your learning,
p227
aVand when you get something wrong,
p228
aVembrace it \u2014 view that failure as a moment of learning \u2014
p229
aVthat number, the percent that could really master calculus
p230
aVor understand organic chemistry,
p231
aVis actually a lot closer to 100 percent.
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd this isn't even just a "nice to have."
p234
aVI think it's a social imperative.
p235
aVWe're exiting what you could call the industrial age
p236
aVand we're going into this information revolution.
p237
aVAnd it's clear that some things are happening.
p238
aVIn the industrial age, society was a pyramid.
p239
aVAt the base of the pyramid, you needed human labor.
p240
aVIn the middle of the pyramid, you had an information processing,
p241
aVa bureaucracy class,
p242
aVand at the top of the pyramid, you had your owners of capital
p243
aVand your entrepreneurs
p244
aVand your creative class.
p245
aVBut we know what's happening already,
p246
aVas we go into this information revolution.
p247
aVThe bottom of that pyramid, automation, is going to take over.
p248
aVEven that middle tier, information processing,
p249
aVthat's what computers are good at.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo as a society, we have a question:
p252
aVAll this new productivity is happening because of this technology,
p253
aVbut who participates in it?
p254
aVIs it just going to be that very top of the pyramid, in which case,
p255
aVwhat does everyone else do?
p256
aVHow do they operate?
p257
aVOr do we do something that's more aspirational?
p258
aVDo we actually attempt to invert the pyramid,
p259
aVwhere you have a large creative class,
p260
aVwhere almost everyone can participate as an entrepreneur,
p261
aVan artist, as a researcher?
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd I don't think that this is utopian.
p264
aVI really think that this is all based on the idea
p265
aVthat if we let people tap into their potential
p266
aVby mastering concepts,
p267
aVby being able to exercise agency over their learning,
p268
aVthat they can get there.
p269
aVAnd when you think of it as just a citizen of the world,
p270
aVit's pretty exciting.
p271
aVI mean, think about the type of equity we can we have,
p272
aVand the rate at which civilization could even progress.
p273
aVAnd so, I'm pretty optimistic about it.
p274
aVI think it's going to be a pretty exciting time to be alive.
p275
aa(lp276
