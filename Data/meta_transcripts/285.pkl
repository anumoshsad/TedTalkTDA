VThis is a work in process,
p4
aVbased on some comments that were made at TED two years ago
p5
aVabout the need for the storage of vaccine.

aa(lp7
V(Video): [On this planet
p8
aV1.6 billion people
p9
aVdon't have access to electricity
p10
aVrefrigeration
p11
aVor stored fuels
p12
aVthis is a problem
p13
aVit impacts:
p14
aVthe spread of disease
p15
aVthe storage of food and medicine
p16
aVand the quality of life.
p17
aVSo here's the plan ... inexpensive refrigeration
p18
aVthat doesn't use electricity, propane, gas, kerosene or consumables
p19
aVtime for some thermodynamics
p20
aVAnd the story of the Intermittent Absorption Refrigerator]
p21
aa(lp22
VAdam Grosser: So 29 years ago, I had this thermo teacher
p23
aVwho talked about absorption and refrigeration, one of those things
p24
aVthat stuck in my head, a lot like the Stirling engine:
p25
aVit was cool, but you didn't know what to do with it.
p26
aVIt was invented in 1858, by this guy Ferdinand Carré,
p27
aVbut he couldn't actually build anything with it
p28
aVbecause of the tools at the time.
p29
aa(lp30
VThis crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley commercialized this thing
p31
aVcalled the IcyBall, in 1928.
p32
aVIt was a really neat idea, and I'll get to why it didn't work,
p33
aVbut here's how it works.
p34
aVThere's two spheres and they're separated in distance.
p35
aVOne has a working fluid, water and ammonia,
p36
aVand the other is a condenser.
p37
aVYou heat up one side, the hot side.
p38
aVThe ammonia evaporates and it recondenses in the other side.
p39
aVYou let it cool to room temperature,
p40
aVand then, as the ammonia reevaporates and combines with the water
p41
aVback on the erstwhile hot side,
p42
aVit creates a powerful cooling effect.
p43
aVSo it was a great idea that didn't work at all.
p44
aVThey blew up.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VBecause you're using ammonia, you get hugely high pressures
p49
aVif you heated them wrong;
p50
aVit topped 400 psi.
p51
aVThe ammonia was toxic, it sprayed everywhere.
p52
aVBut it was kind of an interesting thought.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo the great thing about 2006,
p55
aVthere's a lot of really great computational work you can do.
p56
aVSo we got the whole thermodynamics department at Stanford involved \u2014
p57
aVa lot of computational fluid dynamics.
p58
aVWe proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong.
p59
aVWe found some nontoxic refrigerants
p60
aVthat worked at very low vapor pressures.
p61
aVWe brought in a team from the UK \u2014
p62
aVa lot of great refrigeration people, it turns out, in the UK \u2014
p63
aVand built a test rig, and proved that, in fact,
p64
aVwe could make a low-pressure, nontoxic refrigerator.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo this is the way it works.
p67
aVYou put it on a cooking fire.
p68
aVMost people have cooking fires in the world,
p69
aVwhether it's camel dung or wood.
p70
aVIt heats up for about 30 minutes, cools for an hour.
p71
aVYou put it into a container and it will refrigerate for 24 hours.
p72
aVIt looks like this.
p73
aVThis is the fifth prototype, it's not quite done.
p74
aVIt weighs about eight pounds, and this is the way it works.
p75
aVYou put it into a 15-liter vessel, about three gallons,
p76
aVand it'll cool it down to just above freezing \u2014
p77
aVthree degrees above freezing \u2014
p78
aVfor 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment.
p79
aVIt's really cheap.
p80
aVWe think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars,
p81
aVin low volumes for about 40 dollars.
p82
aVAnd we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have.
p83
aa(lp84
VThank you.
