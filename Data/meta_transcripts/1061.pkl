VI was afraid of womanhood.
p6
aVNot that I'm not afraid now,
p7
aVbut I've learned to pretend.
p8
aVI've learned to be flexible.
p9
aVIn fact, I've developed some interesting tools
p10
aVto help me deal with this fear.
p11
aVLet me explain.
p12
aVBack in the '50s and '60s, when I was growing up,
p13
aVlittle girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful
p14
aVand pretty and gentle and soft,
p15
aVand we were supposed to fit into roles
p16
aVthat were sort of shadowy \u2014
p17
aVreally not quite clear what we were supposed to be.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VThere were plenty of role models all around us.
p22
aVWe had our mothers, our aunts, our cousins, our sisters,
p23
aVand of course, the ever-present media
p24
aVbombarding us with images and words,
p25
aVtelling us how to be.
p26
aVNow my mother was different.
p27
aVShe was a homemaker,
p28
aVbut she and I didn't go out and do girlie things together,
p29
aVand she didn't buy me pink outfits.
p30
aVInstead, she knew what I needed, and she bought me a book of cartoons.
p31
aVAnd I just ate it up.
p32
aVI drew, and I drew,
p33
aVand since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family,
p34
aVI could draw, do what I wanted to do,
p35
aVand not have to perform, not have to speak \u2014
p36
aVI was very shy \u2014
p37
aVand I could still get approval.
p38
aVI was launched as a cartoonist.
p39
aVNow when we're young,
p40
aVwe don't always know. We know there are rules out there,
p41
aVbut we don't always know \u2014
p42
aVwe don't perform them right,
p43
aVeven though we are imprinted at birth
p44
aVwith these things,
p45
aVand we're told
p46
aVwhat the most important color in the world is.
p47
aVWe're told what shape we're supposed to be in.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVWe're told what to wear \u2014
p50
aV(Laughter)
p51
aV\u2014 and how to do our hair \u2014
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aV\u2014 and how to behave.
p54
aa(lp55
VNow the rules that I'm talking about
p56
aVare constantly being monitored by the culture.
p57
aVWe're being corrected,
p58
aVand the primary policemen are women,
p59
aVbecause we are the carriers of the tradition.
p60
aVWe pass it down from generation to generation.
p61
aVNot only that \u2014
p62
aVwe always have this vague notion
p63
aVthat something's expected of us.
p64
aVAnd on top of all off these rules,
p65
aVthey keep changing.
p66
aV(Laughter)
p67
aVWe don't know what's going on half the time,
p68
aVso it puts us in a very tenuous position.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
VNow if you don't like these rules,
p73
aVand many of us don't \u2014
p74
aVI know I didn't, and I still don't,
p75
aVeven though I follow them half the time,
p76
aVnot quite aware that I'm following them \u2014
p77
aVwhat better way than to change them [than] with humor?
p78
aVHumor relies on the traditions of a society.
p79
aVIt takes what we know, and it twists it.
p80
aVIt takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress,
p81
aVand it makes it unexpected,
p82
aVand that's what elicits a laugh.
p83
aVNow what if you put together women and humor?
p84
aVI think you can get change.
p85
aVBecause women are on the ground floor,
p86
aVand we know the traditions so well,
p87
aVwe can bring a different voice to the table.
p88
aa(lp89
VNow I started drawing
p90
aVin the middle of a lot of chaos.
p91
aVI grew up not far from here in Washington D.C.
p92
aVduring the Civil Rights movement, the assassinations,
p93
aVthe Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement,
p94
aVand I think I was drawing,
p95
aVtrying to figure out what was going on.
p96
aVAnd then also my family was in chaos,
p97
aVand I drew to try to bring my family together \u2014
p98
aV(Laughter)
p99
aV\u2014 try to bring my family together with laughter.
p100
aVIt didn't work.
p101
aVMy parents got divorced, and my sister was arrested.
p102
aVBut I found my place.
p103
aVI found that I didn't have to wear high heels,
p104
aVI didn't have to wear pink,
p105
aVand I could feel like I fit in.
p106
aa(lp107
VNow when I was a little older, in my 20s,
p108
aVI realized there are not many women in cartooning.
p109
aVAnd I thought, "Well, maybe I can break
p110
aVthe little glass ceiling of cartooning,"
p111
aVand so I did. I became a cartoonist.
p112
aVAnd then I thought \u2014 in my 40s I started thinking,
p113
aV"Well, why don't I do something?
p114
aVI always loved political cartoons,
p115
aVso why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons
p116
aVto make people think about the stupid rules that we're following
p117
aVas well as laugh?"
p118
aa(lp119
VNow my perspective
p120
aVis a particularly \u2014
p121
aV(Laughter)
p122
aV\u2014 my perspective is a particularly American perspective.
p123
aVI can't help it. I live here.
p124
aVEven though I've traveled a lot,
p125
aVI still think like an American woman.
p126
aVBut I believe that the rules that I'm talking about
p127
aVare universal, of course \u2014
p128
aVthat each culture has its different codes of behavior
p129
aVand dress and traditions,
p130
aVand each woman has to deal with these same things
p131
aVthat we do here in the U.S.
p132
aVConsequently, we have.
p133
aVWomen, because we're on the ground, we know the tradition.
p134
aVWe have amazing antennae.
p135
aa(lp136
VNow my work lately
p137
aVhas been to collaborate with international cartoonists,
p138
aVwhich I so enjoy,
p139
aVand it's given me a greater appreciation
p140
aVfor the power of cartoons
p141
aVto get at the truth,
p142
aVto get at the issues quickly and succinctly.
p143
aVAnd not only that, it can get to the viewer
p144
aVthrough not only the intellect, but through the heart.
p145
aVMy work also has allowed me to collaborate
p146
aVwith women cartoonists from across the world \u2014
p147
aVcountries such as Saudi Arabia,
p148
aVIran, Turkey,
p149
aVArgentina, France \u2014
p150
aVand we have sat together and laughed
p151
aVand talked and shared our difficulties.
p152
aVAnd these women are working so hard to get their voices heard
p153
aVin some very difficult circumstances.
p154
aVBut I feel blessed to be able to work with them.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd we talk about
p157
aVhow women have such strong perceptions,
p158
aVbecause of our tenuous position
p159
aVand our role as tradition-keepers,
p160
aVthat we can have the great potential
p161
aVto be change-agents.
p162
aVAnd I think, I truly believe,
p163
aVthat we can change this thing
p164
aVone laugh at a time.
p165
