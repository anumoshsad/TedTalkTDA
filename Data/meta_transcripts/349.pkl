VHi. I'm here to talk to you about the importance of
p4
aVpraise, admiration and thank you,
p5
aVand having it be specific and genuine.
p6
aa(lp7
VAnd the way I got interested in this was,
p8
aVI noticed in myself, when I was growing up,
p9
aVand until about a few years ago,
p10
aVthat I would want to say thank you to someone,
p11
aVI would want to praise them,
p12
aVI would want to take in their praise of me
p13
aVand I'd just stop it.
p14
aVAnd I asked myself, why?
p15
aVI felt shy, I felt embarrassed.
p16
aVAnd then my question became,
p17
aVam I the only one who does this?
p18
aVSo, I decided to investigate.
p19
aa(lp20
VI'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility,
p21
aVso I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction.
p22
aVAnd sometimes it comes down to something as simple as,
p23
aVtheir core wound is their father died without ever saying he's proud of them.
p24
aVBut then, they hear from all the family and friends
p25
aVthat the father told everybody else that he was proud of him,
p26
aVbut he never told the son.
p27
aVIt's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo my question is, why don't we ask for the things that we need?
p30
aVI know a gentleman, married for 25 years,
p31
aVwho's longing to hear his wife say,
p32
aV"Thank you for being the breadwinner, so I can stay home with the kids,"
p33
aVbut won't ask.
p34
aVI know a woman who's good at this.
p35
aVShe, once a week, meets with her husband and says,
p36
aV"I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids."
p37
aVAnd he goes, "Oh, this is great, this is great."
p38
aVAnd praise really does have to be genuine,
p39
aVbut she takes responsibility for that.
p40
aVAnd a friend of mine, April, who I've had since kindergarten,
p41
aVshe thanks her children for doing their chores.
p42
aVAnd she said, "Why wouldn't I thank it, even though they're supposed to do it?"
p43
aa(lp44
VSo, the question is, why was I blocking it?
p45
aVWhy were other people blocking it?
p46
aVWhy can I say, "I'll take my steak medium rare,
p47
aVI need size six shoes," but I won't say,
p48
aV"Would you praise me this way?"
p49
aVAnd it's because I'm giving you critical data about me.
p50
aVI'm telling you where I'm insecure.
p51
aVI'm telling you where I need your help.
p52
aVAnd I'm treating you, my inner circle,
p53
aVlike you're the enemy.
p54
aVBecause what can you do with that data?
p55
aVYou could neglect me.
p56
aVYou could abuse it.
p57
aVOr you could actually meet my need.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd I took my bike into the bike store\u2014 I love this \u2014
p60
aVsame bike, and they'd do something called "truing" the wheels.
p61
aVThe guy said, "You know, when you true the wheels,
p62
aVit's going to make the bike so much better."
p63
aVI get the same bike back,
p64
aVand they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels
p65
aVI've had for two and a half years, and my bike is like new.
p66
aVSo, I'm going to challenge all of you.
p67
aVI want you to true your wheels:
p68
aVbe honest about the praise that you need to hear.
p69
aVWhat do you need to hear? Go home to your wife \u2014
p70
aVgo ask her, what does she need?
p71
aVGo home to your husband \u2014 what does he need?
p72
aVGo home and ask those questions, and then help the people around you.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd it's simple.
p75
aVAnd why should we care about this?
p76
aVWe talk about world peace.
p77
aVHow can we have world peace with different cultures, different languages?
p78
aVI think it starts household by household, under the same roof.
p79
aVSo, let's make it right in our own backyard.
p80
aVAnd I want to thank all of you in the audience
p81
aVfor being great husbands, great mothers,
p82
aVfriends, daughters, sons.
p83
aVAnd maybe somebody's never said that to you,
p84
aVbut you've done a really, really good job.
p85
aVAnd thank you for being here, just showing up
p86
aVand changing the world with your ideas.
p87
aa(lp88
VThank you.
