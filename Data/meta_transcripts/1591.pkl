VCompanies are losing control.
p4
aVWhat happens on Wall Street
p5
aVno longer stays on Wall Street.
p6
aVWhat happens in Vegas ends up on YouTube. (Laughter)
p7
aVReputations are volatile. Loyalties are fickle.
p8
aVManagement teams seem increasingly
p9
aVdisconnected from their staff. (Laughter)
p10
aVA recent survey said that 27 percent of bosses believe
p11
aVtheir employees are inspired by their firm.
p12
aVHowever, in the same survey, only four percent
p13
aVof employees agreed.
p14
aVCompanies are losing control
p15
aVof their customers and their employees.
p16
aVBut are they really?
p17
aa(lp18
VI'm a marketer, and as a marketer, I know
p19
aVthat I've never really been in control.
p20
aVYour brand is what other people say about you
p21
aVwhen you're not in the room, the saying goes.
p22
aVHyperconnectivity and transparency allow companies
p23
aVto be in that room now, 24/7.
p24
aVThey can listen and join the conversation.
p25
aVIn fact, they have more control over the loss of control
p26
aVthan ever before.
p27
aVThey can design for it. But how?
p28
aa(lp29
VFirst of all, they can give employees and customers more control.
p30
aVThey can collaborate with them on the creation of ideas,
p31
aVknowledge, content, designs and product.
p32
aVThey can give them more control over pricing,
p33
aVwhich is what the band Radiohead did
p34
aVwith its pay-as-you-like online release of its album
p35
aV"In Rainbows." Buyers could determine the price,
p36
aVbut the offer was exclusive, and only stood for a limited period of time.
p37
aVThe album sold more copies than previous releases of the band.
p38
aVThe Danish chocolate company Anthon Berg
p39
aVopened a so-called "generous store" in Copenhagen.
p40
aVIt asked customers to purchase chocolate
p41
aVwith the promise of good deeds towards loved ones.
p42
aVIt turned transactions into interactions,
p43
aVand generosity into a currency.
p44
aVCompanies can even give control to hackers.
p45
aVWhen Microsoft Kinect came out,
p46
aVthe motion-controlled add-on to its Xbox gaming console,
p47
aVit immediately drew the attention of hackers.
p48
aVMicrosoft first fought off the hacks, but then shifted course
p49
aVwhen it realized that actively supporting the community
p50
aVcame with benefits.
p51
aVThe sense of co-ownership, the free publicity,
p52
aVthe added value, all helped drive sales.
p53
aa(lp54
VThe ultimate empowerment of customers
p55
aVis to ask them not to buy.
p56
aVOutdoor clothier Patagonia encouraged prospective buyers
p57
aVto check out eBay for its used products
p58
aVand to resole their shoes before purchasing new ones.
p59
aVIn an even more radical stance against consumerism,
p60
aVthe company placed a "Don't Buy This Jacket"
p61
aVadvertisement during the peak of shopping season.
p62
aVIt may have jeopardized short-term sales,
p63
aVbut it builds lasting, long-term loyalty
p64
aVbased on shared values.
p65
aa(lp66
VResearch has shown that giving employees more control
p67
aVover their work makes them happier and more productive.
p68
aVThe Brazilian company Semco Group famously
p69
aVlets employees set their own work schedules
p70
aVand even their salaries.
p71
aVHulu and Netflix, among other companies,
p72
aVhave open vacation policies.
p73
aa(lp74
VCompanies can give people more control,
p75
aVbut they can also give them less control.
p76
aVTraditional business wisdom holds that trust
p77
aVis earned by predictable behavior,
p78
aVbut when everything is consistent and standardized,
p79
aVhow do you create meaningful experiences?
p80
aVGiving people less control might be a wonderful way
p81
aVto counter the abundance of choice
p82
aVand make them happier.
p83
aVTake the travel service Nextpedition.
p84
aVNextpedition turns the trip into a game,
p85
aVwith surprising twists and turns along the way.
p86
aVIt does not tell the traveler where she's going
p87
aVuntil the very last minute, and information is provided
p88
aVjust in time. Similarly, Dutch airline KLM
p89
aVlaunched a surprise campaign, seemingly randomly
p90
aVhanding out small gifts to travelers
p91
aVen route to their destination.
p92
aVU.K.-based Interflora monitored Twitter
p93
aVfor users who were having a bad day,
p94
aVand then sent them a free bouquet of flowers.
p95
aa(lp96
VIs there anything companies can do to make
p97
aVtheir employees feel less pressed for time? Yes.
p98
aVForce them to help others.
p99
aVA recent study suggests that having employees complete
p100
aVoccasional altruistic tasks throughout the day
p101
aVincreases their sense of overall productivity.
p102
aVAt Frog, the company I work for, we hold internal
p103
aVspeed meet sessions that connect old and new employees,
p104
aVhelping them get to know each other fast.
p105
aVBy applying a strict process, we give them less control,
p106
aVless choice, but we enable more and richer social interactions.
p107
aa(lp108
VCompanies are the makers of their fortunes,
p109
aVand like all of us, they are utterly exposed to serendipity.
p110
aVThat should make them more humble, more vulnerable
p111
aVand more human.
p112
aVAt the end of the day, as hyperconnectivity
p113
aVand transparency expose companies' behavior
p114
aVin broad daylight, staying true to their true selves
p115
aVis the only sustainable value proposition.
p116
aVOr as the ballet dancer Alonzo King said,
p117
aV"What's interesting about you is you."
p118
aVFor the true selves of companies to come through,
p119
aVopenness is paramount,
p120
aVbut radical openness is not a solution,
p121
aVbecause when everything is open, nothing is open.
p122
aV"A smile is a door that is half open and half closed,"
p123
aVthe author Jennifer Egan wrote.
p124
aVCompanies can give their employees and customers
p125
aVmore control or less. They can worry about how much
p126
aVopenness is good for them, and what needs to stay closed.
p127
aVOr they can simply smile, and remain open
p128
aVto all possibilities.
p129
aVThank you. (Applause)
