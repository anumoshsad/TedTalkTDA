VI'm going to talk today about energy and climate.
p4
aVAnd that might seem a bit surprising,
p5
aVbecause my full-time work at the foundation
p6
aVis mostly about vaccines and seeds,
p7
aVabout the things that we need to invent and deliver
p8
aVto help the poorest two billion live better lives.
p9
aVBut energy and climate are extremely important to these people;
p10
aVin fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet.
p11
aVThe climate getting worse means that many years, their crops won't grow:
p12
aVthere will be too much rain, not enough rain;
p13
aVthings will change in ways their fragile environment simply can't support.
p14
aVAnd that leads to starvation, it leads to uncertainty, it leads to unrest.
p15
aVSo, the climate changes will be terrible for them.
p16
aa(lp17
VAlso, the price of energy is very important to them.
p18
aVIn fact, if you could pick just one thing
p19
aVto lower the price of to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy.
p20
aVNow, the price of energy has come down over time.
p21
aVReally advanced civilization is based on advances in energy.
p22
aVThe coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution,
p23
aVand, even in the 1900s, we've seen a very rapid decline
p24
aVin the price of electricity,
p25
aVand that's why we have refrigerators, air-conditioning;
p26
aVwe can make modern materials and do so many things.
p27
aVAnd so, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world.
p28
aVBut as we make it cheaper \u2014 and let's say,
p29
aVlet's go for making it twice as cheap \u2014
p30
aVwe need to meet a new constraint,
p31
aVand that constraint has to do with CO2.
p32
aa(lp33
VCO2 is warming the planet,
p34
aVand the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one.
p35
aVIf you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted,
p36
aVthat leads to a temperature increase,
p37
aVand that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects:
p38
aVthe effects on the weather; perhaps worse, the indirect effects,
p39
aVin that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes,
p40
aVand so you get ecosystem collapses.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow, the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO2
p43
aVto what temperature will be, and where the positive feedbacks are \u2014
p44
aVthere's some uncertainty there, but not very much.
p45
aVAnd there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be,
p46
aVbut they will be extremely bad.
p47
aVI asked the top scientists on this several times:
p48
aVDo we really have to get down to near zero?
p49
aVCan't we just cut it in half or a quarter?
p50
aVAnd the answer is, until we get near to zero,
p51
aVthe temperature will continue to rise.
p52
aVAnd so that's a big challenge.
p53
aVIt's very different than saying,
p54
aV"We're a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge,
p55
aVand we can just sort of squeeze under."
p56
aVThis is something that has to get to zero.
p57
aa(lp58
VNow, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year \u2014
p59
aVover 26 billion tons.
p60
aVFor each American, it's about 20 tons.
p61
aVFor people in poor countries, it's less than one ton.
p62
aVIt's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet.
p63
aVAnd somehow, we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero.
p64
aVIt's been constantly going up.
p65
aVIt's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all,
p66
aVso we have to go from rapidly rising to falling,
p67
aVand falling all the way to zero.
p68
aa(lp69
VThis equation has four factors, a little bit of multiplication.
p70
aVSo you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero,
p71
aVand that's going to be based on the number of people,
p72
aVthe services each person is using on average,
p73
aVthe energy, on average, for each service,
p74
aVand the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.
p75
aVSo let's look at each one of these,
p76
aVand see how we can get this down to zero.
p77
aVProbably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VThat's back from high school algebra.
p82
aVBut let's take a look.
p83
aa(lp84
VFirst, we've got population.
p85
aVThe world today has 6.8 billion people.
p86
aVThat's headed up to about nine billion.
p87
aVNow, if we do a really great job on new vaccines,
p88
aVhealth care, reproductive health services,
p89
aVwe could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent.
p90
aVBut there, we see an increase of about 1.3.
p91
aa(lp92
VThe second factor is the services we use.
p93
aVThis encompasses everything:
p94
aVthe food we eat, clothing, TV, heating.
p95
aVThese are very good things.
p96
aVGetting rid of poverty means providing these services
p97
aVto almost everyone on the planet.
p98
aVAnd it's a great thing for this number to go up.
p99
aVIn the rich world, perhaps the top one billion,
p100
aVwe probably could cut back and use less,
p101
aVbut every year, this number, on average, is going to go up,
p102
aVand so, overall, that will more than double
p103
aVthe services delivered per person.
p104
aVHere we have a very basic service:
p105
aVDo you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework?
p106
aVAnd, in fact, these kids don't,
p107
aVso they're going out and reading their schoolwork
p108
aVunder the street lamps.
p109
aa(lp110
VNow, efficiency, "E," the energy for each service \u2014
p111
aVhere, finally we have some good news.
p112
aVWe have something that's not going up.
p113
aVThrough various inventions and new ways of doing lighting,
p114
aVthrough different types of cars, different ways of building buildings \u2014
p115
aVthere are a lot of services
p116
aVwhere you can bring the energy for that service down
p117
aVquite substantially.
p118
aVSome individual services even bring it down by 90 percent.
p119
aVThere are other services, like how we make fertilizer,
p120
aVor how we do air transport,
p121
aVwhere the rooms for improvement are far, far less.
p122
aVAnd so overall, if we're optimistic, we may get a reduction
p123
aVof a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of six.
p124
aVBut for these first three factors now,
p125
aVwe've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons,
p126
aVand that just won't cut it.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo let's look at this fourth factor \u2014 this is going to be a key one \u2014
p129
aVand this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy.
p130
aVSo the question is: Can you actually get that to zero?
p131
aVIf you burn coal, no.
p132
aVIf you burn natural gas, no.
p133
aVAlmost every way we make electricity today,
p134
aVexcept for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out CO2.
p135
aVAnd so, what we're going to have to do at a global scale,
p136
aVis create a new system.
p137
aVSo we need energy miracles.
p138
aa(lp139
VNow, when I use the term "miracle," I don't mean something that's impossible.
p140
aVThe microprocessor is a miracle.
p141
aVThe personal computer is a miracle.
p142
aVThe Internet and its services are a miracle.
p143
aVSo the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles.
p144
aVUsually, we don't have a deadline
p145
aVwhere you have to get the miracle by a certain date.
p146
aVUsually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don't.
p147
aVThis is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed
p148
aVand get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow, I thought, "How could I really capture this?
p151
aVIs there some kind of natural illustration,
p152
aVsome demonstration that would grab people's imagination here?"
p153
aVI thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitoes,
p154
aVand somehow people enjoyed that.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VIt really got them involved in the idea of, you know,
p159
aVthere are people who live with mosquitoes.
p160
aVWith energy, all I could come up with is this.
p161
aVI decided that releasing fireflies
p162
aVwould be my contribution to the environment here this year.
p163
aVSo here we have some natural fireflies.
p164
aVI'm told they don't bite; in fact, they might not even leave that jar.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VNow, there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one,
p169
aVbut they don't really add up to much.
p170
aVWe need solutions, either one or several,
p171
aVthat have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability.
p172
aVAnd although there's many directions that people are seeking,
p173
aVI really only see five that can achieve the big numbers.
p174
aVI've left out tide, geothermal, fusion, biofuels.
p175
aVThose may make some contribution,
p176
aVand if they can do better than I expect, so much the better.
p177
aVBut my key point here is that we're going to have to work on
p178
aVeach of these five,
p179
aVand we can't give up any of them because they look daunting,
p180
aVbecause they all have significant challenges.
p181
aa(lp182
VLet's look first at burning fossil fuels,
p183
aVeither burning coal or burning natural gas.
p184
aVWhat you need to do there seems like it might be simple, but it's not.
p185
aVAnd that's to take all the CO2,
p186
aVafter you've burned it, going out the flue,
p187
aVpressurize it, create a liquid, put it somewhere,
p188
aVand hope it stays there.
p189
aVNow, we have some pilot things
p190
aVthat do this at the 60 to 80 percent level.
p191
aVBut getting up to that full percentage \u2014 that will be very tricky.
p192
aVAnd agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard,
p193
aVbut the toughest one here is this long-term issue:
p194
aVWho's going to be sure?
p195
aVWho's going to guarantee
p196
aVsomething that is literally billions of times larger
p197
aVthan any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things?
p198
aVThis is a lot of volume.
p199
aVSo that's a tough one.
p200
aa(lp201
VNext would be nuclear.
p202
aVIt also has three big problems:
p203
aVcost, particularly in highly regulated countries, is high;
p204
aVthe issue of safety, really feeling good about nothing could go wrong,
p205
aVthat, even though you have these human operators,
p206
aVthe fuel doesn't get used for weapons.
p207
aVAnd then what do you do with the waste?
p208
aVAlthough it's not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that.
p209
aVPeople need to feel good about it.
p210
aVSo three very tough problems that might be solvable,
p211
aVand so, should be worked on.
p212
aa(lp213
VThe last three of the five, I've grouped together.
p214
aVThese are what people often refer to as the renewable sources.
p215
aVAnd they actually \u2014 although it's great they don't require fuel \u2014
p216
aVthey have some disadvantages.
p217
aVOne is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies
p218
aVis dramatically less than a power plant.
p219
aVThis is energy farming,
p220
aVso you're talking about many square miles, thousands of times more area
p221
aVthan you think of as a normal energy plant.
p222
aVAlso, these are intermittent sources.
p223
aVThe sun doesn't shine all day, it doesn't shine every day,
p224
aVand likewise, the wind doesn't blow all the time.
p225
aVAnd so, if you depend on these sources,
p226
aVyou have to have some way of getting the energy
p227
aVduring those time periods that it's not available.
p228
aVSo we've got big cost challenges here.
p229
aVWe have transmission challenges;
p230
aVfor example, say this energy source is outside your country,
p231
aVyou not only need the technology,
p232
aVbut you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere.
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd, finally, this storage problem.
p235
aVTo dimensionalize this,
p236
aVI went through and looked at all the types of batteries made \u2014
p237
aVfor cars, for computers, for phones, for flashlights, for everything \u2014
p238
aVand compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses.
p239
aVWhat I found is that all the batteries we make now
p240
aVcould store less than 10 minutes of all the energy.
p241
aVAnd so, in fact, we need a big breakthrough here,
p242
aVsomething that's going to be a factor of 100 better
p243
aVthan the approaches we have now.
p244
aVIt's not impossible, but it's not a very easy thing.
p245
aVNow, this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source
p246
aVto be above, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're using.
p247
aVIf you're counting on it for 100 percent,
p248
aVyou need an incredible miracle battery.
p249
aa(lp250
VNow, how are we going to go forward on this \u2014 what's the right approach?
p251
aVIs it a Manhattan Project? What's the thing that can get us there?
p252
aVWell, we need lots of companies working on this \u2014 hundreds.
p253
aVIn each of these five paths, we need at least a hundred people.
p254
aVA lot of them, you'll look at and say, "They're crazy."
p255
aVThat's good.
p256
aVAnd, I think, here in the TED group,
p257
aVwe have many people who are already pursuing this.
p258
aVBill Gross has several companies, including one called eSolar
p259
aVthat has some great solar thermal technologies.
p260
aVVinod Khosla is investing in dozens of companies
p261
aVthat are doing great things and have interesting possibilities,
p262
aVand I'm trying to help back that.
p263
aVNathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company
p264
aVthat, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach.
p265
aVThere are some innovations in nuclear: modular, liquid.
p266
aVInnovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago,
p267
aVso the idea that there's some good ideas laying around
p268
aVis not all that surprising.
p269
aa(lp270
VThe idea of TerraPower is that, instead of burning a part of uranium \u2014
p271
aVthe one percent, which is the U235 \u2014
p272
aVwe decided, "Let's burn the 99 percent, the U238."
p273
aVIt is kind of a crazy idea.
p274
aVIn fact, people had talked about it for a long time,
p275
aVbut they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not,
p276
aVand so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers
p277
aVthat now you can simulate and see that, yes,
p278
aVwith the right materials approach, this looks like it would work.
p279
aa(lp280
VAnd because you're burning that 99 percent,
p281
aVyou have greatly improved cost profile.
p282
aVYou actually burn up the waste, and you can actually use as fuel
p283
aVall the leftover waste from today's reactors.
p284
aVSo instead of worrying about them, you just take that, it's a great thing.
p285
aVIt breeds this uranium as it goes along, so it's kind of like a candle.
p286
aVYou see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor.
p287
aVIn terms of fuel, this really solves the problem.
p288
aVI've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky.
p289
aVThis is the leftover, the 99 percent,
p290
aVwhere they've taken out the part they burn now,
p291
aVso it's called depleted uranium.
p292
aVThat would power the US for hundreds of years.
p293
aVAnd simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process,
p294
aVyou'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet.
p295
aa(lp296
VSo, you know, it's got lots of challenges ahead,
p297
aVbut it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas
p298
aVthat we need to move forward.
p299
aVSo let's think: How should we measure ourselves?
p300
aVWhat should our report card look like?
p301
aVWell, let's go out to where we really need to get,
p302
aVand then look at the intermediate.
p303
aVFor 2050, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction.
p304
aVThat really is very important, that we get there.
p305
aVAnd that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries \u2014
p306
aVstill some agriculture; hopefully, we will have cleaned up forestry, cement.
p307
aVSo, to get to that 80 percent,
p308
aVthe developed countries, including countries like China,
p309
aVwill have had to switch their electricity generation altogether.
p310
aVThe other grade is: Are we deploying this zero-emission technology,
p311
aVhave we deployed it in all the developed countries
p312
aVand are in the process of getting it elsewhere?
p313
aVThat's super important.
p314
aVThat's a key element of making that report card.
p315
aa(lp316
VBacking up from there, what should the 2020 report card look like?
p317
aVWell, again, it should have the two elements.
p318
aVWe should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions:
p319
aVThe less we emit, the less that sum will be of CO2,
p320
aVand therefore, the less the temperature.
p321
aVBut in some ways, the grade we get there,
p322
aVdoing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions,
p323
aVis only equally, or maybe even slightly less, important than the other,
p324
aVwhich is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs.
p325
aa(lp326
VThese breakthroughs, we need to move those at full speed,
p327
aVand we can measure that in terms of companies,
p328
aVpilot projects, regulatory things that have been changed.
p329
aVThere's a lot of great books that have been written about this.
p330
aVThe Al Gore book, "Our Choice,"
p331
aVand the David MacKay book, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."
p332
aVThey really go through it and create a framework
p333
aVthat this can be discussed broadly,
p334
aVbecause we need broad backing for this.
p335
aVThere's a lot that has to come together.
p336
aa(lp337
VSo this is a wish.
p338
aVIt's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology.
p339
aVIf you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years \u2014
p340
aVI could pick who's president,
p341
aVI could pick a vaccine, which is something I love,
p342
aVor I could pick that this thing
p343
aVthat's half the cost with no CO2 gets invented \u2014
p344
aVthis is the wish I would pick.
p345
aVThis is the one with the greatest impact.
p346
aVIf we don't get this wish,
p347
aVthe division between the people who think short term and long term
p348
aVwill be terrible,
p349
aVbetween the US and China, between poor countries and rich,
p350
aVand most of all,
p351
aVthe lives of those two billion will be far worse.
p352
aa(lp353
VSo what do we have to do?
p354
aVWhat am I appealing to you to step forward and drive?
p355
aVWe need to go for more research funding.
p356
aVWhen countries get together in places like Copenhagen,
p357
aVthey shouldn't just discuss the CO2.
p358
aVThey should discuss this innovation agenda.
p359
aVYou'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending
p360
aVon these innovative approaches.
p361
aVWe do need the market incentives \u2014 CO2 tax, cap and trade \u2014
p362
aVsomething that gets that price signal out there.
p363
aVWe need to get the message out.
p364
aVWe need to have this dialogue be a more rational,
p365
aVmore understandable dialogue,
p366
aVincluding the steps that the government takes.
p367
aVThis is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achieve.
p368
aa(lp369
VThank you.
p370
aa(lp371
V(Applause)
p372
aV(Applause ends)
p373
aa(lp374
VThank you.
p375
aa(lp376
VChris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.
p377
aa(lp378
V(Applause)
p379
aa(lp380
VCA: Thank you.
p381
aVSo to understand more about TerraPower.
p382
aVI mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is?
p383
aa(lp384
VBill Gates: To actually do the software, buy the supercomputer,
p385
aVhire all the great scientists, which we've done,
p386
aVthat's only tens of millions.
p387
aVAnd even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor
p388
aVto make sure our materials work properly,
p389
aVthen you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions.
p390
aVThe tough thing is building the pilot reactor \u2014
p391
aVfinding the several billion, finding the regulator, the location
p392
aVthat will actually build the first one of these.
p393
aVOnce you get the first one built, if it works as advertised,
p394
aVthen it's just clear as day,
p395
aVbecause the economics, the energy density, are so different
p396
aVthan nuclear as we know it.
p397
aa(lp398
VCA: So to understand it right,
p399
aVthis involves building deep into the ground,
p400
aValmost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel, of this spent uranium,
p401
aVand then the process starts at the top and kind of works down?
p402
aa(lp403
VBG: That's right.
p404
aVToday, you're always refueling the reactor,
p405
aVso you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong,
p406
aVwhere you're opening it up and moving things in and out \u2014
p407
aVthat's not good.
p408
aVSo if you have very \u2014
p409
aa(lp410
V(Laughter)
p411
aa(lp412
Vvery cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in \u2014
p413
aVjust think of it as a log \u2014
p414
aVput it down and not have those same complexities.
p415
aVAnd it just sits there and burns for the 60 years, and then it's done.
p416
aa(lp417
VCA: It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution.
p418
aa(lp419
VBG: Yeah; what happens with the waste,
p420
aVyou can let it sit there \u2014 there's a lot less waste under this approach \u2014
p421
aVthen you can actually take that
p422
aVand put it into another one and burn that.
p423
aVAnd we start out, actually, by taking the waste that exists today
p424
aVthat's sitting in these cooling pools or dry-casking by reactors \u2014
p425
aVthat's our fuel to begin with.
p426
aVSo the thing that's been a problem from those reactors
p427
aVis actually what gets fed into ours,
p428
aVand you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically
p429
aVas you're going through this process.
p430
aa(lp431
VCA: You're talking to different people around the world
p432
aVabout the possibilities.
p433
aVWhere is there most interest in actually doing something with this?
p434
aa(lp435
VBG: Well, we haven't picked a particular place,
p436
aVand there's all these interesting disclosure rules
p437
aVabout anything that's called "nuclear."
p438
aVSo we've got a lot of interest.
p439
aVPeople from the company have been in Russia, India, China.
p440
aVI've been back seeing the secretary of energy here,
p441
aVtalking about how this fits into the energy agenda.
p442
aVSo I'm optimistic.
p443
aVThe French and Japanese have done some work.
p444
aVThis is a variant on something that has been done.
p445
aVIt's an important advance, but it's like a fast reactor,
p446
aVand a lot of countries have built them,
p447
aVso anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate
p448
aVto be where the first one gets built.
p449
aa(lp450
VCA: So, in your mind,
p451
aVtimescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live?
p452
aa(lp453
VBG: Well, we need \u2014 for one of these high-scale, electro-generation things
p454
aVthat's very cheap,
p455
aVwe have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy.
p456
aVThat's sort of the deadline
p457
aVthat the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet.
p458
aVAnd TerraPower \u2014 if things go well, which is wishing for a lot \u2014
p459
aVcould easily meet that.
p460
aVAnd there are, fortunately now, dozens of companies \u2014
p461
aVwe need it to be hundreds \u2014
p462
aVwho, likewise, if their science goes well,
p463
aVif the funding for their pilot plants goes well,
p464
aVthat they can compete for this.
p465
aVAnd it's best if multiple succeed,
p466
aVbecause then you could use a mix of these things.
p467
aVWe certainly need one to succeed.
p468
aa(lp469
VCA: In terms of big-scale possible game changers,
p470
aVis this the biggest that you're aware of out there?
p471
aa(lp472
VBG: An energy breakthrough is the most important thing.
p473
aVIt would have been, even without the environmental constraint,
p474
aVbut the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater.
p475
aVIn the nuclear space, there are other innovators.
p476
aVYou know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one,
p477
aVbut the modular people, that's a different approach.
p478
aVThere's a liquid-type reactor, which seems a little hard,
p479
aVbut maybe they say that about us.
p480
aVAnd so, there are different ones,
p481
aVbut the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium
p482
aVhas a million times as much energy as a molecule of, say, coal.
p483
aVAnd so, if you can deal with the negatives,
p484
aVwhich are essentially the radiation, the footprint and cost,
p485
aVthe potential, in terms of effect on land and various things,
p486
aVis almost in a class of its own.
p487
aa(lp488
VCA: If this doesn't work, then what?
p489
aVDo we have to start taking emergency measures
p490
aVto try and keep the temperature of the earth stable?
p491
aa(lp492
VBG: If you get into that situation,
p493
aVit's like if you've been overeating, and you're about to have a heart attack.
p494
aVThen where do you go?
p495
aVYou may need heart surgery or something.
p496
aVThere is a line of research on what's called geoengineering,
p497
aVwhich are various techniques that would delay the heating
p498
aVto buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together.
p499
aVNow, that's just an insurance policy; you hope you don't need to do that.
p500
aVSome people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy
p501
aVbecause it might make you lazy,
p502
aVthat you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you.
p503
aVI'm not sure that's wise, given the importance of the problem,
p504
aVbut there's now the geoengineering discussion
p505
aVabout: Should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster,
p506
aVor this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect?
p507
aa(lp508
VCA: Climate skeptics:
p509
aVIf you had a sentence or two to say to them,
p510
aVhow might you persuade them that they're wrong?
p511
aa(lp512
VBG: Well, unfortunately, the skeptics come in different camps.
p513
aVThe ones who make scientific arguments are very few.
p514
aVAre they saying there's negative feedback effects
p515
aVthat have to do with clouds that offset things?
p516
aVThere are very, very few things that they can even say
p517
aVthere's a chance in a million of those things.
p518
aVThe main problem we have here \u2014 it's kind of like with AIDS:
p519
aVyou make the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot later.
p520
aa(lp521
VAnd so, when you have all sorts of urgent problems,
p522
aVthe idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later,
p523
aVand a somewhat uncertain pain thing.
p524
aVIn fact, the IPCC report \u2014 that's not necessarily the worst case,
p525
aVand there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say,
p526
aV"OK, that isn't that big of a deal."
p527
aVThe fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this.
p528
aVBut my dream here is that,
p529
aVif you can make it economic, and meet the CO2 constraints,
p530
aVthen the skeptics say,
p531
aV"OK, I don't care that it doesn't put out CO2,
p532
aVI kind of wish it did put out CO2.
p533
aVBut I guess I'll accept it,
p534
aVbecause it's cheaper than what's come before."
p535
aa(lp536
V(Applause)
p537
aa(lp538
VCA: So that would be your response to the Bjørn Lomborg argument,
p539
aVbasically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem,
p540
aVit's going to take away all your other goals
p541
aVof trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth,
p542
aVit's a stupid waste of the Earth's resources
p543
aVto put money towards that
p544
aVwhen there are better things we can do.
p545
aa(lp546
VBG: Well, the actual spending on the R&D piece \u2014
p547
aVsay the US should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now \u2014
p548
aVit's not that dramatic.
p549
aVIt shouldn't take away from other things.
p550
aVThe thing you get into big money on, and reasonable people can disagree,
p551
aVis when you have something that's non-economic
p552
aVand you're trying to fund that \u2014
p553
aVthat, to me, mostly is a waste.
p554
aVUnless you're very close,
p555
aVand you're just funding the learning curve and it's going to get very cheap,
p556
aVI believe we should try more things
p557
aVthat have a potential to be far less expensive.
p558
aVIf the trade-off you get into is, "Let's make energy super expensive,"
p559
aVthen the rich can afford that.
p560
aVI mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy
p561
aVand not change our lifestyle.
p562
aVThe disaster is for that two billion.
p563
aa(lp564
VAnd even Lomborg has changed.
p565
aVHis shtick now is, "Why isn't the R&D getting more discussed?"
p566
aVHe's still, because of his earlier stuff,
p567
aVstill associated with the skeptic camp,
p568
aVbut he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp,
p569
aVand so, he's making the R&D point.
p570
aVAnd so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate.
p571
aVThe R&D piece \u2014 it's crazy how little it's funded.
p572
aa(lp573
VCA: Well, Bill, I suspect I speak on behalf of most people here
p574
aVto say I really hope your wish comes true.
p575
aVThank you so much.
