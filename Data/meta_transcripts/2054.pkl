VI didn't know when I agreed to do this
p4
aVwhether I was expected to talk or to sing.
p5
aVBut when I was told that the topic was language,
p6
aVI felt that I had to speak about something for a moment.
p7
aa(lp8
VI have a problem.
p9
aVIt's not the worst thing in the world.
p10
aVI'm fine.
p11
aVI'm not on fire.
p12
aVI know that other people in the world
p13
aVhave far worse things to deal with,
p14
aVbut for me, language and music are
p15
aVinextricably linked through this one thing.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd the thing is that I have a stutter.
p18
aVIt might seem curious given that I spend
p19
aVa lot of my life on the stage.
p20
aVOne would assume that I'm comfortable
p21
aVin the public sphere and comfortable here,
p22
aVspeaking to you guys.
p23
aVBut the truth is that I've spent my life up until this point
p24
aVand including this point, living in mortal dread
p25
aVof public speaking.
p26
aVPublic singing, whole different thing. (Laughter)
p27
aVBut we'll get to that in a moment.
p28
aVI've never really talked about it before so explicitly.
p29
aVI think that that's because I've always lived in hope
p30
aVthat when I was a grown-up,
p31
aVI wouldn't have one.
p32
aVI sort of lived with this idea that when I'm grown,
p33
aVI'll have learned to speak French,
p34
aVand when I'm grown, I'll learn how to manage my money,
p35
aVand when I'm grown, I won't have a stutter,
p36
aVand then I'll be able to public speak and maybe be the prime minister
p37
aVand anything's possible and, you know.
p38
aV(Laughter)
p39
aVSo I can talk about it now
p40
aVbecause I've reached this point, where \u2014
p41
aVI mean, I'm 28.
p42
aVI'm pretty sure that I'm grown now.
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aVAnd I'm an adult woman
p45
aVwho spends her life as a performer,
p46
aVwith a speech impediment.
p47
aVSo, I might as well come clean about it.
p48
aa(lp49
VThere are some interesting angles to having a stutter.
p50
aVFor me, the worst thing that can happen
p51
aVis meeting another stutterer.
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aVThis happened to me in Hamburg, when
p54
aVthis guy, we met and he said,
p55
aV"Hello, m-m-m-my name is Joe,"
p56
aVand I said, "Oh, hello, m-m-m-my name is Meg."
p57
aVImagine my horror when I realized
p58
aVhe thought I was making fun of him.
p59
aV(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VPeople think I'm drunk all the time.
p62
aV(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VPeople think that I've forgotten their name
p65
aVwhen I hesitate before saying it.
p66
aVAnd it is a very weird thing, because
p67
aVproper nouns are the worst.
p68
aVIf I'm going to use the word "Wednesday" in a sentence,
p69
aVand I'm coming up to the word,
p70
aVand I can feel that I'm going to stutter or something,
p71
aVI can change the word to "tomorrow,"
p72
aVor "the day after Tuesday,"
p73
aVor something else.
p74
aVIt's clunky, but you can get away with it,
p75
aVbecause over time I've developed this
p76
aVloophole method of using speech
p77
aVwhere right at the last minute you
p78
aVchange the thing and you trick your brain.
p79
aVBut with people's names, you can't change them.
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aVWhen I was singing a lot of jazz,
p82
aVI worked a lot with a pianist whose name was Steve.
p83
aVAs you can probably gather,
p84
aVS's and T's, together or independently,
p85
aVare my kryptonite.
p86
aVBut I would have to introduce the band
p87
aVover this rolling vamp,
p88
aVand when I got around to Steve,
p89
aVI'd often find myself stuck on the "St."
p90
aVAnd it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable  and it totally kills the vibe.
p91
aVSo after a few instances of this,
p92
aVSteve happily became "Seve,"
p93
aVand we got through it that way. (Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VI've had a lot of therapy,
p96
aVand a common form of treatment is to use
p97
aVthis technique that's called smooth speech,
p98
aVwhich is where you almost sing everything that you say.
p99
aVYou kind of join everything together in this
p100
aVvery singsong, kindergarten teacher way,
p101
aVand it makes you sound very serene, like you've had lots of Valium,
p102
aVand everything is calm. (Laughter)
p103
aVThat's not actually me.
p104
aVAnd I do use that. I do.
p105
aVI use it when I have to be on panel shows,
p106
aVor when I have to do radio interviews,
p107
aVwhen the economy of airtime is paramount.
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aVI get through it that way for my job.
p110
aVBut as an artist who feels that their work
p111
aVis based solely on a platform of honesty
p112
aVand being real,
p113
aVthat feels often like cheating.
p114
aa(lp115
VWhich is why before I sing, I wanted to tell you
p116
aVwhat singing means to me.
p117
aVIt's more than making nice sounds,
p118
aVand it's more than making nice songs.
p119
aVIt's more than feeling known, or understood.
p120
aVIt's more than making you feel the things that I feel.
p121
aVIt's not about mythology,
p122
aVor mythologizing myself to you.
p123
aVSomehow, through some miraculous
p124
aVsynaptic function of the human brain,
p125
aVit's impossible to stutter when you sing.
p126
aVAnd when I was younger, that was a method of treatment
p127
aVthat worked very well for me,
p128
aVsinging, so I did it a lot.
p129
aVAnd that's why I'm here today.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Applause)
p132
aa(lp133
VThank you.
p134
aa(lp135
VSinging for me is sweet relief.
p136
aVIt is the only time when I feel fluent.
p137
aVIt is the only time when what comes out of my mouth
p138
aVis comprehensively exactly what I intended.
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aVSo I know that this is a TED Talk,
p141
aVbut now i'm going to TED sing.
p142
aVThis is a song that I wrote last year.
p143
aa(lp144

p149
aa(lp150
V\u266a I would be a beauty \u266a
p151
aa(lp152
V\u266a but my nose \u266a
p153
aa(lp154
V\u266a is slightly too big \u266a
p155
aa(lp156
V\u266a for my face \u266a
p157
aa(lp158
V\u266a And I would be a dreamer \u266a
p159
aa(lp160
V\u266a but my dream \u266a
p161
aa(lp162
V\u266a is slightly too big \u266a
p163
aa(lp164
V\u266a for this space \u266a
p165
aa(lp166
V\u266a And I would be an angel \u266a
p167
aa(lp168
V\u266a but my halo \u266a
p169
aa(lp170
V\u266a it pales in the glow \u266a
p171
aa(lp172
V\u266a of your grace \u266a
p173
aa(lp174
V\u266a And I would be a joker \u266a
p175
aa(lp176
V\u266a but that card looks silly when you play \u266a
p177
aa(lp178
V\u266a your ace \u266a
p179
aa(lp180
V\u266a I'd like to know \u266a
p181
aa(lp182
V\u266a Are there stars in hell? \u266a
p183
aa(lp184
V\u266a And I'd like to know \u266a
p185
aa(lp186
V\u266a know if you can tell \u266a
p187
aa(lp188
V\u266a that you make me lose everything I know \u266a
p189
aa(lp190
V\u266a That I cannot choose to or not let go \u266a
p191
aa(lp192
V\u266a And I'd stay forever \u266a
p193
aa(lp194
V\u266a but my home \u266a
p195
aa(lp196
V\u266a is slightly too far \u266a
p197
aa(lp198
V\u266a from this place \u266a
p199
aa(lp200
V\u266a And I swear I tried to \u266a
p201
aa(lp202
V\u266a slow it down \u266a
p203
aa(lp204
V\u266a when I am walking at your pace \u266a
p205
aa(lp206
V\u266a But all I could think \u266a
p207
aa(lp208
V\u266a idling through the cities \u266a
p209
aa(lp210
V\u266a do I look pretty in the rain? \u266a
p211
aa(lp212
V\u266a And I don't know how someone \u266a
p213
aa(lp214
V\u266a quite so lovely \u266a
p215
aa(lp216
V\u266a makes me feel ugly \u266a
p217
aa(lp218
V\u266a So much shame \u266a
p219
aa(lp220
V\u266a And I'd like to know \u266a
p221
aa(lp222
V\u266a Are there stars in hell? \u266a
p223
aa(lp224
V\u266a And I'd like to know \u266a
