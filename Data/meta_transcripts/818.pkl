V"People do stupid things.
p4
aVThat's what spreads HIV."
p5
aVThis was a headline in a U.K. newspaper,
p6
aVThe Guardian, not that long ago.
p7
aVI'm curious, show of hands, who agrees with it?
p8
aVWell, one or two brave souls.
p9
aa(lp10
VThis is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist
p11
aVwho's been in field of HIV for 15 years,
p12
aVworked on four continents,
p13
aVand you're looking at her.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd I am now going to argue
p16
aVthat this is only half true.
p17
aVPeople do get HIV because they do stupid things,
p18
aVbut most of them are doing stupid things
p19
aVfor perfectly rational reasons.
p20
aVNow, "rational" is the dominant paradigm
p21
aVin public health,
p22
aVand if you put your public health nerd glasses on,
p23
aVyou'll see that if we give people the information that they need
p24
aVabout what's good for them and what's bad for them,
p25
aVif you give them the services
p26
aVthat they can use to act on that information,
p27
aVand a little bit of motivation,
p28
aVpeople will make rational decisions
p29
aVand live long and healthy lives.
p30
aVWonderful.
p31
aa(lp32
VThat's slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV,
p33
aVand although I'm sure you all know
p34
aVthat HIV is about poverty and gender inequality,
p35
aVand if you were at TED '07
p36
aVit's about coffee prices ...
p37
aVActually, HIV's about sex and drugs,
p38
aVand if there are two things that make
p39
aVhuman beings a little bit irrational,
p40
aVthey are erections and addiction.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VSo, let's start with what's rational for an addict.
p45
aVNow, I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine, Frankie.
p46
aVWe were having lunch and he was telling me
p47
aVabout when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection.
p48
aVIt was someone's birthday, and they had very kindly
p49
aVsmuggled some heroin into jail,
p50
aVand he was very generously sharing it out
p51
aVwith all of his colleagues.
p52
aVAnd so everyone lined up,
p53
aVall the smackheads in a row,
p54
aVand the guy whose birthday it was
p55
aVfilled up the fit,
p56
aVand he went down and started injecting people.
p57
aVSo he injects the first guy,
p58
aVand then he's wiping the needle on his shirt,
p59
aVand he injects the next guy.
p60
aVAnd Frankie says, "I'm number 22 in line,
p61
aVand I can see the needle coming down towards me,
p62
aVand there is blood all over the place.
p63
aVIt's getting blunter and blunter.
p64
aVAnd a small part of my brain is thinking,
p65
aV'That is so gross
p66
aVand really dangerous,'
p67
aVbut most of my brain is thinking,
p68
aV'Please let there be some smack left
p69
aVby the time it gets to me.
p70
aVPlease let there be some left.'"
p71
aVAnd then, telling me this story,
p72
aVFrankie said,
p73
aV"You know ... God,
p74
aVdrugs really make you stupid."
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd, you know, you can't fault him for accuracy.
p77
aVBut, actually, Frankie, at that time,
p78
aVwas a heroin addict and he was in jail.
p79
aVSo his choice was either
p80
aVto accept that dirty needle or not to get high.
p81
aVAnd if there's one place you really want to get high,
p82
aVit's when you're in jail.
p83
aa(lp84
VBut I'm a scientist
p85
aVand I don't like to make data out of anecdotes,
p86
aVso let's look at some data.
p87
aVWe talked to 600 drug addicts
p88
aVin three cities in Indonesia,
p89
aVand we said, "Well, do you know how you get HIV?"
p90
aV"Oh yeah, by sharing needles."
p91
aVI mean, nearly 100 percent. Yeah, by sharing needles.
p92
aVAnd, "Do you know where you can get a clean needle
p93
aVat a price you can afford to avoid that?"
p94
aV"Oh yeah." Hundred percent.
p95
aV"We're smackheads; we know where to get clean needles."
p96
aV"So are you carrying a needle?"
p97
aVWe're actually interviewing people on the street,
p98
aVin the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs.
p99
aV"Are you carrying clean needles?"
p100
aVOne in four, maximum.
p101
aVSo no surprises then that
p102
aVthe proportion that actually used clean needles
p103
aVevery time they injected in the last week
p104
aVis just about one in 10,
p105
aVand the other nine in 10 are sharing.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo you've got this massive mismatch;
p108
aVeveryone knows that
p109
aVif they share they're going to get HIV,
p110
aVbut they're all sharing anyway.
p111
aVSo what's that about? Is it like you get a better high if you share or something?
p112
aVWe asked that to a junkie and they're like, "Are you nuts?"
p113
aVYou don't want to share a needle anymore than you want
p114
aVto share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with.
p115
aVThere's just kind of an ick factor there.
p116
aV"No, no. We share needles because we don't want to go to jail."
p117
aVSo, in Indonesia at this time,
p118
aVif you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up,
p119
aVthey could put you into jail.
p120
aVAnd that changes the equation slightly, doesn't it?
p121
aVBecause your choice now is either
p122
aVI use my own needle now,
p123
aVor I could share a needle now
p124
aVand get a disease that's going to
p125
aVpossibly kill me 10 years from now,
p126
aVor I could use my own needle now
p127
aVand go to jail tomorrow.
p128
aVAnd while junkies think that
p129
aVit's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV,
p130
aVthey think it's a much worse idea
p131
aVto spend the next year in jail
p132
aVwhere they'll probably end up in Frankie's situation
p133
aVand expose themselves to HIV anyway.
p134
aVSo, suddenly it becomes perfectly rational
p135
aVto share needles.
p136
aa(lp137
VNow, let's look at it from a policy maker's point of view.
p138
aVThis is a really easy problem.
p139
aVFor once, your incentives are aligned.
p140
aVWe've got what's rational for public health.
p141
aVYou want people to use clean needles \u2014
p142
aVand junkies want to use clean needles.
p143
aVSo we could make this problem go away
p144
aVsimply by making clean needles universally available
p145
aVand taking away the fear of arrest.
p146
aVNow, the first person to figure that out
p147
aVand do something about it on a national scale
p148
aVwas that well-known, bleeding heart liberal
p149
aVMargaret Thatcher.
p150
aVAnd she put in the world's first
p151
aVnational needle exchange program,
p152
aVand other countries followed suit: Australia, The Netherlands and few others.
p153
aVAnd in all of those countries, you can see,
p154
aVnot more than four percent of injectors
p155
aVever became infected with HIV.
p156
aa(lp157
VNow, places that didn't do this \u2014 New York City for example,
p158
aVMoscow, Jakarta \u2014
p159
aVwe're talking, at its peak,
p160
aVone in two injectors
p161
aVinfected with this fatal disease.
p162
aVNow, Margaret Thatcher didn't do this
p163
aVbecause she has any great love for junkies.
p164
aVShe did it because she ran a country
p165
aVthat had a national health service.
p166
aVSo, if she didn't invest in effective prevention,
p167
aVshe was going to have pick up the costs
p168
aVof treatment later on,
p169
aVand obviously those are much higher.
p170
aVSo she was making a politically rational decision.
p171
aVNow, if I take out my
p172
aVpublic health nerd glasses here
p173
aVand look at these data,
p174
aVit seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it?
p175
aVBut in this country,
p176
aVwhere the government apparently does not feel compelled
p177
aVto provide health care for citizens, (Laughter)
p178
aVwe've taken a very different approach.
p179
aVSo what we've been doing in the United States
p180
aVis reviewing the data \u2014 endlessly reviewing the data.
p181
aVSo, these are reviews of hundreds of studies
p182
aVby all the big muckety-mucks
p183
aVof the scientific pantheon in the United States,
p184
aVand these are the studies that show
p185
aVneedle programs are effective \u2014 quite a lot of them.
p186
aVNow, the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective \u2014
p187
aVyou think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides
p188
aVand I'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it's going to come up,
p189
aVbut no \u2014 that's the whole slide.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VThere is nothing on the other side.
p194
aVSo, completely irrational,
p195
aVyou would think.
p196
aVExcept that, wait a minute, politicians are rational, too,
p197
aVand they're responding to what they think the voters want.
p198
aVSo what we see is that voters respond
p199
aVvery well to things like this
p200
aVand not quite so well to things like this.
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
VSo it becomes quite rational
p205
aVto deny services to injectors.
p206
aVNow let's talk about sex.
p207
aVAre we any more rational about sex?
p208
aVWell, I'm not even going to address
p209
aVthe clearly irrational positions
p210
aVof people like the Catholic Church,
p211
aVwho think somehow that if you give out condoms,
p212
aVeveryone's going to run out and have sex.
p213
aVI don't know if Pope Benedict
p214
aVwatches TEDTalks online,
p215
aVbut if you do, I've got news for you Benedict \u2014
p216
aVI carry condoms all the time
p217
aVand I never get laid.
p218
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p219
aVIt's not that easy!
p220
aVHere, maybe you'll have better luck.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Applause)
p223
aa(lp224
VOkay, seriously,
p225
aVHIV is actually not that easy
p226
aVto transmit sexually.
p227
aVSo, it depends on how much virus there is
p228
aVin your blood and in your body fluids.
p229
aVAnd what we've got is a very, very high level of virus
p230
aVright at the beginning when you're first infected,
p231
aVthen you start making antibodies,
p232
aVand then it bumps along at quite low levels
p233
aVfor a long time \u2014 10 or 12 years \u2014
p234
aVyou have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection.
p235
aVBut basically, nothing much is going on
p236
aVuntil you start to get symptomatic AIDS,
p237
aVand by that stage,
p238
aVyou're not looking great, you're not feeling great,
p239
aVyou're not having that much sex.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo the sexual transmission of HIV
p242
aVis essentially determined by how many partners you have
p243
aVin these very short spaces of time
p244
aVwhen you have peak viremia.
p245
aVNow, this makes people crazy
p246
aVbecause it means that you have to talk about
p247
aVsome groups having more sexual partners
p248
aVin shorter spaces of time than other groups,
p249
aVand that's considered stigmatizing.
p250
aVI've always been a bit curious about that
p251
aVbecause I think stigma is a bad thing,
p252
aVwhereas lots of sex is quite a good thing,
p253
aVbut we'll leave that be.
p254
aVThe truth is that 20 years
p255
aVof very good research
p256
aVhave shown us that
p257
aVthere are groups that are more likely to turnover
p258
aVlarge numbers of partners in a short space of time.
p259
aVAnd those groups are, globally,
p260
aVpeople who sell sex and their more regular partners.
p261
aVThey are gay men on the party scene
p262
aVwho have, on average, three times more partners
p263
aVthan straight people on the party scene.
p264
aVAnd they are heterosexuals
p265
aVwho come from countries that have
p266
aVtraditions of polygamy
p267
aVand relatively high levels of female autonomy,
p268
aVand almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa.
p269
aVAnd that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today.
p270
aa(lp271
VYou can see these horrifying figures from Africa.
p272
aVThese are all countries in southern Africa
p273
aVwhere between one in seven,
p274
aVand one in three
p275
aVof all adults,
p276
aVare infected with HIV.
p277
aVNow, in the rest of the world,
p278
aVwe've got basically nothing going on in the general population \u2014
p279
aVvery, very low levels \u2014
p280
aVbut we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV
p281
aVin these other populations who are at highest risk:
p282
aVdrug injectors, sex workers
p283
aVand gay men.
p284
aVAnd you'll note, that's the local data from Los Angeles:
p285
aV25 percent prevalence among gay men.
p286
aVOf course, you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex.
p287
aVYou can only HIV by having unprotected sex
p288
aVwith a positive person.
p289
aa(lp290
VIn most of the world,
p291
aVthese few prevention failures
p292
aVnotwithstanding,
p293
aVwe are actually doing quite well these days
p294
aVin commercial sex:
p295
aVcondom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent
p296
aVin commercial sex in most countries.
p297
aVAnd, again, it's because of an alignment of the incentives.
p298
aVWhat's rational for public health
p299
aVis also rational for individual sex workers
p300
aVbecause it's really bad for business to have another STI.
p301
aVNo one wants it.
p302
aVAnd, actually, clients don't want to go home with a drip either.
p303
aVSo essentially, you're able to achieve
p304
aVquite high rates of condom use in commercial sex.
p305
aa(lp306
VBut in "intimate" relations
p307
aVit's much more difficult because,
p308
aVwith your wife or your boyfriend
p309
aVor someone that you hope might turn into one of those things,
p310
aVwe have this illusion of romance
p311
aVand trust and intimacy,
p312
aVand nothing is quite so unromantic
p313
aVas the, "My condom or yours, darling?" question.
p314
aVSo in the face of that,
p315
aVyou really need quite a strong incentive
p316
aVto use condoms.
p317
aa(lp318
VThis, for example, this gentleman is called Joseph.
p319
aVHe's from Haiti and he has AIDS.
p320
aVAnd he's probably not having a lot of sex right now,
p321
aVbut he is a reminder in the population,
p322
aVof why you might want to be
p323
aVusing condoms.
p324
aVThis is also in Haiti and is a reminder
p325
aVof why you might want to be having sex, perhaps.
p326
aVNow, funnily enough, this is also Joseph
p327
aVafter six months on antiretroviral treatment.
p328
aVNot for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect.
p329
aVBut it is changing the equation
p330
aVof what's rational
p331
aVin sexual decision-making.
p332
aVSo, what we've got \u2014
p333
aVsome people say, "Oh, it doesn't matter very much
p334
aVbecause, actually, treatment is effective prevention
p335
aVbecause it lowers your viral load and therefore
p336
aVmakes it more difficult to transmit HIV."
p337
aVSo, if you look at the viremia thing again,
p338
aVif you do start treatment when you're sick,
p339
aVwell, what happens? Your viral load comes down.
p340
aVBut compared to what? What happens if you're not on treatment?
p341
aVWell, you die,
p342
aVso your viral load goes to zero.
p343
aVAnd all of this green stuff here, including the spikes \u2014
p344
aVwhich are because you couldn't get to the pharmacy,
p345
aVor you ran out of drugs, or you went on a three day party binge
p346
aVand forgot to take your drugs,
p347
aVor because you've started to get resistance, or whatever \u2014
p348
aVall of that is virus
p349
aVthat wouldn't be out there, except for treatment.
p350
aa(lp351
VNow, am I saying, "Oh, well, great prevention strategy.
p352
aVLet's just stop treating people."
p353
aVOf course not, of course not.
p354
aVWe need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can.
p355
aVBut what I am doing is calling into question
p356
aVthose people who say that more treatment
p357
aVis all the prevention we need.
p358
aVThat's simply not necessarily true,
p359
aVand I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men
p360
aVin rich countries where treatment has been widely available
p361
aVfor going on 15 years now.
p362
aVAnd what we've seen is
p363
aVthat, actually, condom use rates,
p364
aVwhich were very, very high \u2014
p365
aVthe gay community responded very rapidly to HIV,
p366
aVwith extremely little help
p367
aVfrom public health nerds, I would say \u2014
p368
aVthat condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment
p369
aVfor two reasons really:
p370
aVOne is the assumption of, "Oh well,
p371
aVif he's infected, he's probably on meds,
p372
aVand his viral load's going to be low, so I'm pretty safe."
p373
aa(lp374
VAnd the other thing is that people are simply
p375
aVnot as scared of HIV
p376
aVas they were of AIDS, and rightly so.
p377
aVAIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you,
p378
aVand HIV is an invisible virus
p379
aVthat makes you take a pill every day.
p380
aVAnd that's boring,
p381
aVbut is it as boring as
p382
aVhaving to use a condom every time you have sex,
p383
aVno matter how drunk you are,
p384
aVno matter how many poppers you've taken, whatever?
p385
aVIf we look at the data, we can see that
p386
aVthe answer to that question
p387
aVis, mmm.
p388
aa(lp389
VSo these are data from Scotland.
p390
aVYou see the peak in drug injectors
p391
aVbefore they started the national needle exchange program.
p392
aVThen it came way down.
p393
aVAnd both in heterosexuals \u2014 mostly in commercial sex \u2014
p394
aVand in drug users,
p395
aVyou've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins,
p396
aVand that's because of that alignment of incentives
p397
aVthat I talked about earlier.
p398
aVBut in gay men,
p399
aVyou've got quite a dramatic rise
p400
aVstarting three or four years
p401
aVafter treatment became widely available.
p402
aVThis is of new infections.
p403
aa(lp404
VWhat does that mean?
p405
aVIt means that the combined effect of being less worried
p406
aVand having more virus out there in the population \u2014
p407
aVmore people living longer, healthier lives,
p408
aVmore likely to be getting laid
p409
aVwith HIV \u2014
p410
aVis outweighing the effects of lower viral load,
p411
aVand that's a very worrisome thing.
p412
aVWhat does it mean?
p413
aVIt means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have.
p414
aa(lp415
VIs that what's happening?
p416
aVNo, and I call it the "compassion conundrum."
p417
aVWe've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days,
p418
aVand what's happening really is that people are
p419
aVunable quite to bring themselves to put in
p420
aVgood sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers,
p421
aVunable quite to be giving out needles to junkies.
p422
aVBut once they've gone from being
p423
aVtransgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone
p424
aVto being AIDS victims,
p425
aVwe come over all compassionate
p426
aVand buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives.
p427
aVIt doesn't make any sense
p428
aVfrom a public health point of view.
p429
aa(lp430
VI want to give what's very nearly the last word to Ines.
p431
aVInes is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta;
p432
aVshe's a chick with a dick.
p433
aVWhy does she do that job?
p434
aVWell, of course, because she's forced into it
p435
aVbecause she doesn't have any better option, etc., etc.
p436
aVAnd if we could just teach her to sew
p437
aVand get her a nice job in a factory, all would be well.
p438
aVThis is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia:
p439
aVon average, 20 cents.
p440
aVIt varies a bit province to province.
p441
aVI do speak to sex workers, 15,000 of them
p442
aVfor this particular slide,
p443
aVand this is what sex workers
p444
aVsay they earn in an hour.
p445
aVSo it's not a great job, but for a lot of people
p446
aVit really is quite a rational choice.
p447
aVOkay, Ines.
p448
aa(lp449
VWe've got the tools, the knowledge and the cash,
p450
aVand commitment to preventing HIV too.
p451
aa(lp452
VInes: So why is prevalence still rising?
p453
aVIt's all politics.
p454
aVWhen you get to politics, nothing makes sense.
p455
aa(lp456
VElizabeth Pisani: "When you get to politics, nothing makes sense."
p457
aVSo, from the point of view of a sex worker,
p458
aVpoliticians are making no sense.
p459
aVFrom the point of view of a public health nerd,
