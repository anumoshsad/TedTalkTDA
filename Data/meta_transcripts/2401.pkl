VLate in January 1975,
p4
aVa 17-year-old German girl called Vera Brandes
p5
aVwalked out onto the stage of the Cologne Opera House.
p6
aVThe auditorium was empty.
p7
aVIt was lit only by the dim, green glow of the emergency exit sign.
p8
aVThis was the most exciting day of Vera's life.
p9
aVShe was the youngest concert promoter in Germany,
p10
aVand she had persuaded the Cologne Opera House
p11
aVto host a late-night concert of jazz
p12
aVfrom the American musician, Keith Jarrett.
p13
aV1,400 people were coming.
p14
aVAnd in just a few hours,
p15
aVJarrett would walk out on the same stage,
p16
aVhe'd sit down at the piano
p17
aVand without rehearsal or sheet music,
p18
aVhe would begin to play.
p19
aa(lp20
VBut right now,
p21
aVVera was introducing Keith to the piano in question,
p22
aVand it wasn't going well.
p23
aVJarrett looked to the instrument a little warily,
p24
aVplayed a few notes,
p25
aVwalked around it,
p26
aVplayed a few more notes,
p27
aVmuttered something to his producer.
p28
aVThen the producer came over to Vera and said ...
p29
aV"If you don't get a new piano, Keith can't play."
p30
aa(lp31
VThere'd been a mistake.
p32
aVThe opera house had provided the wrong instrument.
p33
aVThis one had this harsh, tinny upper register,
p34
aVbecause all the felt had worn away.
p35
aVThe black notes were sticking,
p36
aVthe white notes were out of tune,
p37
aVthe pedals didn't work
p38
aVand the piano itself was just too small.
p39
aVIt wouldn't create the volume
p40
aVthat would fill a large space such as the Cologne Opera House.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo Keith Jarrett left.
p43
aVHe went and sat outside in his car,
p44
aVleaving Vera Brandes
p45
aVto get on the phone to try to find a replacement piano.
p46
aVNow she got a piano tuner,
p47
aVbut she couldn't get a new piano.
p48
aVAnd so she went outside
p49
aVand she stood there in the rain,
p50
aVtalking to Keith Jarrett,
p51
aVbegging him not to cancel the concert.
p52
aVAnd he looked out of his car
p53
aVat this bedraggled, rain-drenched German teenager,
p54
aVtook pity on her,
p55
aVand said,
p56
aV"Never forget ... only for you."
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd so a few hours later,
p59
aVJarrett did indeed step out onto the stage of the opera house,
p60
aVhe sat down at the unplayable piano
p61
aVand began.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Music)
p64
aa(lp65
VWithin moments it became clear that something magical was happening.
p66
aVJarrett was avoiding those upper registers,
p67
aVhe was sticking to the middle tones of the keyboard,
p68
aVwhich gave the piece a soothing, ambient quality.
p69
aVBut also, because the piano was so quiet,
p70
aVhe had to set up these rumbling, repetitive riffs in the bass.
p71
aVAnd he stood up twisting, pounding down on the keys,
p72
aVdesperately trying to create enough volume to reach the people in the back row.
p73
aa(lp74
VIt's an electrifying performance.
p75
aVIt somehow has this peaceful quality,
p76
aVand at the same time it's full of energy,
p77
aVit's dynamic.
p78
aVAnd the audience loved it.
p79
aVAudiences continue to love it
p80
aVbecause the recording of the Köln Concert
p81
aVis the best-selling piano album in history
p82
aVand the best-selling solo jazz album in history.
p83
aa(lp84
VKeith Jarrett had been handed a mess.
p85
aVHe had embraced that mess, and it soared.
p86
aVBut let's think for a moment about Jarrett's initial instinct.
p87
aVHe didn't want to play.
p88
aVOf course,
p89
aVI think any of us, in any remotely similar situation,
p90
aVwould feel the same way, we'd have the same instinct.
p91
aVWe don't want to be asked to do good work with bad tools.
p92
aVWe don't want to have to overcome unnecessary hurdles.
p93
aVBut Jarrett's instinct was wrong,
p94
aVand thank goodness he changed his mind.
p95
aVAnd I think our instinct is also wrong.
p96
aVI think we need to gain a bit more appreciation
p97
aVfor the unexpected advantages of having to cope with a little mess.
p98
aVSo let me give you some examples
p99
aVfrom cognitive psychology,
p100
aVfrom complexity science,
p101
aVfrom social psychology,
p102
aVand of course, rock 'n' roll.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo cognitive psychology first.
p105
aVWe've actually known for a while
p106
aVthat certain kinds of difficulty,
p107
aVcertain kinds of obstacle,
p108
aVcan actually improve our performance.
p109
aVFor example,
p110
aVthe psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer,
p111
aVa few years ago,
p112
aVteamed up with high school teachers.
p113
aVAnd he asked them to reformat the handouts
p114
aVthat they were giving to some of their classes.
p115
aVSo the regular handout would be formatted in something straightforward,
p116
aVsuch as Helvetica or Times New Roman.
p117
aVBut half these classes were getting handouts that were formatted
p118
aVin something sort of intense, like Haettenschweiler,
p119
aVor something with a zesty bounce, like Comic Sans italicized.
p120
aVNow, these are really ugly fonts,
p121
aVand they're difficult fonts to read.
p122
aVBut at the end of the semester,
p123
aVstudents were given exams,
p124
aVand the students who'd been asked to read the more difficult fonts,
p125
aVhad actually done better on their exams,
p126
aVin a variety of subjects.
p127
aVAnd the reason is,
p128
aVthe difficult font had slowed them down,
p129
aVforced them to work a bit harder,
p130
aVto think a bit more about what they were reading,
p131
aVto interpret it ...
p132
aVand so they learned more.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnother example.
p135
aVThe psychologist Shelley Carson has been testing Harvard undergraduates
p136
aVfor the quality of their attentional filters.
p137
aVWhat do I mean by that?
p138
aVWhat I mean is, imagine you're in a restaurant,
p139
aVyou're having a conversation,
p140
aVthere are all kinds of other conversations going on in the restaurant,
p141
aVyou want to filter them out,
p142
aVyou want to focus on what's important to you.
p143
aVCan you do that?
p144
aVIf you can, you have good, strong attentional filters.
p145
aVBut some people really struggle with that.
p146
aVSome of Carson's undergraduate subjects struggled with that.
p147
aVThey had weak filters, they had porous filters \u2014
p148
aVlet a lot of external information in.
p149
aVAnd so what that meant is they were constantly being interrupted
p150
aVby the sights and the sounds of the world around them.
p151
aVIf there was a television on while they were doing their essays,
p152
aVthey couldn't screen it out.
p153
aa(lp154
VNow, you would think that that was a disadvantage ...
p155
aVbut no.
p156
aVWhen Carson looked at what these students had achieved,
p157
aVthe ones with the weak filters
p158
aVwere vastly more likely
p159
aVto have some real creative milestone in their lives,
p160
aVto have published their first novel,
p161
aVto have released their first album.
p162
aVThese distractions were actually grists to their creative mill.
p163
aVThey were able to think outside the box because their box was full of holes.
p164
aa(lp165
VLet's talk about complexity science.
p166
aVSo how do you solve a really complex \u2014
p167
aVthe world's full of complicated problems \u2014
p168
aVhow do you solve a really complicated problem?
p169
aa(lp170
VFor example, you try to make a jet engine.
p171
aVThere are lots and lots of different variables,
p172
aVthe operating temperature, the materials,
p173
aVall the different dimensions, the shape.
p174
aVYou can't solve that kind of problem all in one go,
p175
aVit's too hard.
p176
aVSo what do you do?
p177
aVWell, one thing you can do is try to solve it step-by-step.
p178
aVSo you have some kind of prototype
p179
aVand you tweak it, you test it, you improve it.
p180
aVYou tweak it, you test it, you improve it.
p181
aVNow, this idea of marginal gains will eventually get you a good jet engine.
p182
aVAnd it's been quite widely implemented in the world.
p183
aVSo you'll hear about it, for example, in high performance cycling,
p184
aVweb designers will talk about trying to optimize their web pages,
p185
aVthey're looking for these step-by-step gains.
p186
aa(lp187
VThat's a good way to solve a complicated problem.
p188
aVBut you know what would make it a better way?
p189
aVA dash of mess.
p190
aVYou add randomness,
p191
aVearly on in the process,
p192
aVyou make crazy moves,
p193
aVyou try stupid things that shouldn't work,
p194
aVand that will tend to make the problem-solving work better.
p195
aVAnd the reason for that is
p196
aVthe trouble with the step-by-step process,
p197
aVthe marginal gains,
p198
aVis they can walk you gradually down a dead end.
p199
aVAnd if you start with the randomness, that becomes less likely,
p200
aVand your problem-solving becomes more robust.
p201
aa(lp202
VLet's talk about social psychology.
p203
aVSo the psychologist Katherine Phillips, with some colleagues,
p204
aVrecently gave murder mystery problems to some students,
p205
aVand these students were collected in groups of four
p206
aVand they were given dossiers with information about a crime \u2014
p207
aValibis and evidence, witness statements and three suspects.
p208
aVAnd the groups of four students were asked to figure out who did it,
p209
aVwho committed the crime.
p210
aVAnd there were two treatments in this experiment.
p211
aVIn some cases these were four friends,
p212
aVthey all knew each other well.
p213
aVIn other cases,
p214
aVthree friends and a stranger.
p215
aVAnd you can see where I'm going with this.
p216
aa(lp217
VObviously I'm going to say
p218
aVthat the groups with the stranger solved the problem more effectively,
p219
aVwhich is true, they did.
p220
aVActually, they solved the problem quite a lot more effectively.
p221
aVSo the groups of four friends,
p222
aVthey only had a 50-50 chance of getting the answer right.
p223
aVWhich is actually not that great \u2014
p224
aVin multiple choice, for three answers? 50-50's not good.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VThe three friends and the stranger,
p229
aVeven though the stranger didn't have any extra information,
p230
aVeven though it was just a case
p231
aVof how that changed the conversation to accommodate that awkwardness,
p232
aVthe three friends and the stranger,
p233
aVthey had a 75 percent chance of finding the right answer.
p234
aVThat's quite a big leap in performance.
p235
aa(lp236
VBut I think what's really interesting
p237
aVis not just that the three friends and the stranger did a better job,
p238
aVbut how they felt about it.
p239
aVSo when Katherine Phillips interviewed the groups of four friends,
p240
aVthey had a nice time,
p241
aVthey also thought they'd done a good job.
p242
aVThey were complacent.
p243
aVWhen she spoke to the three friends and the stranger,
p244
aVthey had not had a nice time \u2014
p245
aVit's actually rather difficult, it's rather awkward ...
p246
aVand they were full of doubt.
p247
aVThey didn't think they'd done a good job even though they had.
p248
aVAnd I think that really exemplifies
p249
aVthe challenge that we're dealing with here.
p250
aa(lp251
VBecause, yeah \u2014
p252
aVthe ugly font,
p253
aVthe awkward stranger,
p254
aVthe random move ...
p255
aVthese disruptions help us solve problems,
p256
aVthey help us become more creative.
p257
aVBut we don't feel that they're helping us.
p258
aVWe feel that they're getting in the way ...
p259
aVand so we resist.
p260
aVAnd that's why the last example is really important.
p261
aa(lp262
VSo I want to talk about somebody
p263
aVfrom the background of the world of rock 'n' roll.
p264
aVAnd you may know him, he's actually a TED-ster.
p265
aVHis name is Brian Eno.
p266
aVHe is an ambient composer \u2014 rather brilliant.
p267
aa(lp268
VHe's also a kind of catalyst
p269
aVbehind some of the great rock 'n' roll albums of the last 40 years.
p270
aVHe's worked with David Bowie on "Heroes,"
p271
aVhe worked with U2 on "Achtung Baby" and "The Joshua Tree,"
p272
aVhe's worked with DEVO,
p273
aVhe's worked with Coldplay, he's worked with everybody.
p274
aa(lp275
VAnd what does he do to make these great rock bands better?
p276
aVWell, he makes a mess.
p277
aVHe disrupts their creative processes.
p278
aVIt's his role to be the awkward stranger.
p279
aVIt's his role to tell them
p280
aVthat they have to play the unplayable piano.
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd one of the ways in which he creates this disruption
p283
aVis through this remarkable deck of cards \u2014
p284
aVI have my signed copy here \u2014 thank you, Brian.
p285
aVThey're called The Oblique Strategies,
p286
aVhe developed them with a friend of his.
p287
aVAnd when they're stuck in the studio,
p288
aVBrian Eno will reach for one of the cards.
p289
aVHe'll draw one at random,
p290
aVand he'll make the band follow the instructions on the card.
p291
aa(lp292
VSo this one ...
p293
aV"Change instrument roles."
p294
aVYeah, everyone swap instruments \u2014 Drummer on the piano \u2014
p295
aVBrilliant, brilliant idea.
p296
aa(lp297
V"Look closely at the most  embarrassing details. Amplify them."
p298
aa(lp299
V"Make a sudden, destructive, unpredictable action. Incorporate."
p300
aa(lp301
VThese cards are disruptive.
p302
aa(lp303
VNow, they've proved their worth in album after album.
p304
aVThe musicians hate them.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VSo Phil Collins was playing drums on an early Brian Eno album.
p309
aVHe got so frustrated he started throwing beer cans across the studio.
p310
aa(lp311
VCarlos Alomar, great rock guitarist,
p312
aVworking with Eno on David Bowie's "Lodger" album,
p313
aVand at one point he turns to Brian and says,
p314
aV"Brian, this experiment is stupid."
p315
aVBut the thing is it was a pretty good album,
p316
aVbut also,
p317
aVCarlos Alomar, 35 years later, now uses The Oblique Strategies.
p318
aVAnd he tells his students to use The Oblique Strategies
p319
aVbecause he's realized something.
p320
aVJust because you don't like it doesn't mean it isn't helping you.
p321
aa(lp322
VThe strategies actually weren't a deck of cards originally,
p323
aVthey were just a list \u2014
p324
aVlist on the recording studio wall.
p325
aVA checklist of things you might try if you got stuck.
p326
aa(lp327
VThe list didn't work.
p328
aVKnow why?
p329
aVNot messy enough.
p330
aVYour eye would go down the list
p331
aVand it would settle on whatever was the least disruptive,
p332
aVthe least troublesome,
p333
aVwhich of course misses the point entirely.
p334
aa(lp335
VAnd what Brian Eno came to realize was,
p336
aVyes, we need to run the stupid experiments,
p337
aVwe need to deal with the awkward strangers,
p338
aVwe need to try to read the ugly fonts.
p339
aVThese things help us.
p340
aVThey help us solve problems,
p341
aVthey help us be more creative.
p342
aa(lp343
VBut also ...
p344
aVwe really need some persuasion if we're going to accept this.
p345
aVSo however we do it ...
p346
aVwhether it's sheer willpower,
p347
aVwhether it's the flip of a card
p348
aVor whether it's a guilt trip from a German teenager,
p349
aVall of us, from time to time,
p350
aVneed to sit down and try and play the unplayable piano.
p351
aa(lp352
VThank you.
