VI was listed on the online biography
p4
aVthat said I was a design missionary.
p5
aVThat's a bit lofty; I'm really more
p6
aVof something like a street walker.
p7
aVI spend a lot of time in urban areas
p8
aVlooking for design,
p9
aVand studying design in the public sector.
p10
aVI take about 5,000 photographs a year,
p11
aVand I thought that I would edit from these,
p12
aVand try to come up with some images
p13
aVthat might be appropriate and interesting to you.
p14
aVAnd I used three criteria:
p15
aVthe first was, I thought I'd talk about
p16
aVreal design within reach,
p17
aVdesign that's free, not design not quite within reach,
p18
aVas we're fondly known by our competition and competitors,
p19
aVbut stuff that you can find on the streets, stuff that was free,
p20
aVstuff that was available to all people,
p21
aVand stuff that probably contains some other important messages.
p22
aa(lp23
VI'll use these sidewalks in Rio as an example.
p24
aVA very common public design done in the '50s.
p25
aVIt's got a nice kind of flowing, organic form,
p26
aVvery consistent with the Brazilian culture \u2014
p27
aVI think good design adds to culture.
p28
aVWholly inconsistent with San Francisco or New York.
p29
aVBut I think these are my sort of information highways:
p30
aVI live in much more of an analog world,
p31
aVwhere pedestrian traffic and
p32
aVinteraction and diversity exchange,
p33
aVand where I think the simple things under our feet
p34
aVhave a great amount of meaning to us.
p35
aa(lp36
VHow did I get started in this business?
p37
aVI was a ceramic designer for about 10 years,
p38
aVand just loved utilitarian form \u2014
p39
aVsimple things that we use every day,
p40
aVlittle compositions of color and surface on form.
p41
aVThis led me to starting a company called Design Within Reach,
p42
aVa company dealing with simple forms,
p43
aVmaking good designers available to us,
p44
aVand also selling the personalities and character of the designers
p45
aVas well, and it seems to have worked.
p46
aVA couple of years into the process,
p47
aVI spent a lot of time in Europe traveling around, looking for design.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd I had a bit of a wake-up call in Amsterdam:
p50
aVI was there going into the design stores,
p51
aVand mixing with our crowd of designers,
p52
aVand I recognized that a whole lot of stuff
p53
aVpretty much looked the same, and the effect of globalization
p54
aVhas had that in our community also.
p55
aVWe know a lot about what's going on with design around the world,
p56
aVand it's getting increasingly more difficult
p57
aVto find design that reflects a unique culture.
p58
aVI was walking around on the streets of Amsterdam
p59
aVand I recognized, you know, the big story
p60
aVfrom Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores,
p61
aVit's what's out on the streets,
p62
aVand maybe it's self-explanatory,
p63
aVbut a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism,
p64
aVthat's preserved its kind of architecture and character,
p65
aVand where the bicycle plays an important part of the way
p66
aVin which people get around and where pedestrian rights
p67
aVare protected.
p68
aVAnd I write a newsletter that goes out every week,
p69
aVand I wrote an article about this, and it got such enormous response
p70
aVthat I realized that design, that common design,
p71
aVthat's in the public area means a lot to people,
p72
aVand establishes kind of a groundwork and a dialog.
p73
aa(lp74
VI then kind of thought about the other cities
p75
aVin Europe where I spend a lot of time looking for design,
p76
aVlike Basel, where Vitra is located, or in northern Italy \u2014
p77
aVall cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles,
p78
aVand where pedestrian areas \u2014 and I came to the conclusion that perhaps
p79
aVthere was something about these important design centers
p80
aVthat dealt with bicycles and foot traffic,
p81
aVand I'm sure the skeptic eye would say, no, the correlation there
p82
aVis that there are universities and schools
p83
aVwhere people can't afford cars,
p84
aVbut it did seem that in many of these areas
p85
aVpedestrian traffic was protected.
p86
aVYou wouldn't look at this and call this a designer bike:
p87
aVa designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum.
p88
aVBut I began looking at design in a place like Amsterdam
p89
aVand recognized, you know, the first job of design
p90
aVis to serve a social purpose.
p91
aVAnd so I look at this bike as not being a designer bike,
p92
aVbut being a very good example of design.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd since that time in Amsterdam, I spent an increasing amount of time
p95
aVin the cities, looking at design
p96
aVfor common evidence of design
p97
aVthat really isn't under so much of a designer's signature.
p98
aVI was in Buenos Aires very recently,
p99
aVand I went to see this bridge by Santiago Calatrava.
p100
aVHe's a Spanish architect and designer.
p101
aVAnd the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge \u2014
p102
aVI love bridges, metaphorically and symbolically and structurally \u2014
p103
aVand it was a bit of a disappointment,
p104
aVbecause of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it; it really wasn't in use.
p105
aVAnd I recognized that oftentimes design,
p106
aVwhen you're set up to see design,
p107
aVit can be a bit of a letdown.
p108
aa(lp109
VBut there were lots of other things going on in this area:
p110
aVit was a kind of construction zone;
p111
aVa lot of buildings were going up.
p112
aVAnd, approaching a building from a distance, you don't see too much;
p113
aVyou get a little closer, and you arrive at a nice little composition
p114
aVthat might remind you of a Mondrian or a Diebenkorn or something.
p115
aVBut to me it was an example of
p116
aVindustrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation
p117
aVand a nice little still life \u2014 kind of unintended piece of design.
p118
aVAnd going a little closer, you get a different perspective.
p119
aVI find these little vignettes,
p120
aVthese little accidental pieces of design,
p121
aVto be refreshing.
p122
aVThey give me, I don't know,
p123
aVa sense of correctness in the world
p124
aVand some visual delight in the knowledge
p125
aVthat the building will probably never look as good
p126
aVas this simple industrial scaffolding
p127
aVthat is there to serve.
p128
aa(lp129
VDown the road, there was another building, a nice visual structure:
p130
aVhorizontal, vertical elements, little decorative lines
p131
aVgoing across, these magenta squiggles,
p132
aVthe workmen being reduced to decorative elements,
p133
aVjust a nice, kind of, breakup
p134
aVof the urban place.
p135
aVAnd, you know, that no longer exists.
p136
aVYou've captured it for a moment, and finding this little still life's
p137
aVlike listening to little songs or something:
p138
aVit gives me an enormous amount of pleasure.
p139
aVAntoine Predock designed
p140
aVa wonderful ball stadium in San Diego
p141
aVcalled Petco Park.
p142
aVA terrific use of local materials,
p143
aVbut inside you could find some interior compositions.
p144
aVSome people go to baseball stadiums to look at games;
p145
aVI go and see design relationships.
p146
aVJust a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture,
p147
aVand the way that the trees form vertical elements.
p148
aa(lp149
VRed is a color in the landscape
p150
aVthat is often on stop signs.
p151
aVIt takes your attention; it has a great amount of emotion;
p152
aVit stares back at you the way that a figure might.
p153
aVJust a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in Italy.
p154
aVConstruction site in New York:
p155
aVred having this kind of emotional power
p156
aVthat's almost an equivalent with the way in which \u2014
p157
aVcuteness of puppies and such.
p158
aVSide street in Italy.
p159
aVRed drew me into this little composition,
p160
aVoptimistic to me in the sense that maybe
p161
aVthe public service's mailbox,
p162
aVdoor service, plumbing.
p163
aVIt looks as if these different public services
p164
aVwork together to create some nice little compositions.
p165
aVIn Italy, you know, almost everything, kind of, looks good.
p166
aVSimple menus put on a board,
p167
aVachieving, kind of, the sort of balance.
p168
aVBut I'm convinced that it's because
p169
aVyou're walking around the streets and seeing things.
p170
aVRed can be comical: it can draw your attention
p171
aVto the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant
p172
aVsuffering from bad civic planning in Havana.
p173
aVColor can animate simple blocks,
p174
aVsimple materials:
p175
aVwalking in New York, I'll stop.
p176
aa(lp177
VI don't always know why I take photographs of things.
p178
aVA nice visual composition of symmetry.
p179
aVCurves against sharp things.
p180
aVIt's a comment on the way in which we deal with
p181
aVpublic seating in the city of New York.
p182
aVI've come across some other just,
p183
aVkind of, curious relationships
p184
aVof bollards on the street that have different interpretations,
p185
aVbut \u2014 these things amuse me.
p186
aVSometimes a trash can \u2014 this is just in the street in San Francisco \u2014
p187
aVa trash can that's been left there for 18 months
p188
aVcreates a nice 45-degree angle
p189
aVagainst these other relationships,
p190
aVand turns a common parking spot into a nice little piece of sculpture.
p191
aVSo, there's this sort of silent hand of design at work
p192
aVthat I see in places that I go.
p193
aa(lp194
VHavana is a wonderful area.
p195
aVIt's quite free of commercial clutter:
p196
aVyou don't see our logos and brands and names,
p197
aVand therefore you're alert to things physically.
p198
aVAnd this is a great protection of a pedestrian zone,
p199
aVand the repurposing of some colonial cannons to do that.
p200
aVAnd Cuba needs to be far more resourceful,
p201
aVbecause of the blockades and things,
p202
aVbut a really wonderful playground.
p203
aa(lp204
VI've often wondered why Italy is really a leader in modern design.
p205
aVIn our area, in furnishings,
p206
aVthey're sort of way at the top.
p207
aVThe Dutch are good also, but the Italians are good.
p208
aVAnd I came across this little street in Venice,
p209
aVwhere the communist headquarters
p210
aVwere sharing a wall with this Catholic shrine.
p211
aVAnd I realized that, you know, Italy is a place
p212
aVwhere they can accept these different ideologies
p213
aVand deal with diversity and not have the problem,
p214
aVor they can choose to ignore them,
p215
aVbut these \u2014 you don't have warring factions,
p216
aVand I think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity
p217
aVwhich has made Italy so innovative
p218
aVand so tolerant.
p219
aVThe past and the present work quite well together in Italy also,
p220
aVand I think that it's recognizable there,
p221
aVand has an important effect on culture,
p222
aVbecause their public spaces are protected,
p223
aVtheir sidewalks are protected,
p224
aVand you're actually able to confront these things
p225
aVphysically,
p226
aVand I think this helps people get over
p227
aVtheir fear of modernism and other such things.
p228
aa(lp229
VA change might be a typical street corner in San Francisco.
p230
aVAnd I use this \u2014 this is, sort of,
p231
aVwhat I consider to be urban spam.
p232
aVI notice this stuff because I walk a lot,
p233
aVbut here, private industry is really kind of
p234
aVmaking a mess of the public sector.
p235
aVAnd as I look at it, I sort of say, you know,
p236
aVthe publications that report on problems in the urban area
p237
aValso contribute to it,
p238
aVand it's just my call to say to all of us,
p239
aVpublic policy won't change this at all;
p240
aVprivate industry has to work to take things like this seriously.
p241
aa(lp242
VThe extreme might be in Italy where, again,
p243
aVthere's kind of some type of control
p244
aVover what's happening in the environment is very evident,
p245
aVeven in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals.
p246
aVI walk to work every day or ride my scooter,
p247
aVand I come down and park in this little spot.
p248
aVAnd I came down one day,
p249
aVand all the bikes were red.
p250
aVNow, this is not going to impress you guys who Photoshop, and can do stuff,
p251
aVbut this was an actual moment
p252
aVwhen I got off my bike,
p253
aVand I looked and I thought, it's as if
p254
aVall of my biker brethren
p255
aVhad kind of gotten together and conspired
p256
aVto make a little statement.
p257
aVAnd it reminded me that \u2014
p258
aVto keep in the present,
p259
aVto look out for these kinds of things.
p260
aa(lp261
VIt gave me possibilities for wonder \u2014
p262
aVif maybe it's a yellow day in San Francisco, and we could all agree,
p263
aVand create some installations.
p264
aVBut it also reminded me of the power
p265
aVof pattern and repetition
p266
aVto make an effect in our mind.
p267
aVAnd I don't know if there's a stronger kind of effect
p268
aVthan pattern and the way it unites
p269
aVkind of disparate elements.
p270
aVI was at the art show in Miami in December,
p271
aVand spent a couple of hours looking at fine art,
p272
aVand amazed at the prices of art
p273
aVand how expensive it is, but having a great time looking at it.
p274
aVAnd I came outside, and the valets for this car service
p275
aVhad created, you know, quite a nice little collage
p276
aVof these car keys,
p277
aVand my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags
p278
aVthat I had seen in Tokyo.
p279
aVAnd I thought that if
p280
aVpattern can unite these disparate elements,
p281
aVit can do just about anything.
p282
aa(lp283
VI don't have very many shots of people,
p284
aVbecause they kind of  get in the way of studying pure form.
p285
aVI was in a small restaurant in Spain,
p286
aVhaving lunch \u2014
p287
aVone of those nice days where
p288
aVyou had the place kind of to yourself,
p289
aVand you have a glass of wine, and enjoying the local area
p290
aVand the culture and the food
p291
aVand the quiet, and feeling very lucky,
p292
aVand a bus load of tourists arrived,
p293
aVemptied out,
p294
aVfilled up the restaurant.
p295
aVIn a very short period of time,
p296
aVcompletely changed the atmosphere
p297
aVand character with loud voices and large bodies and such,
p298
aVand we had to get up and leave;
p299
aVit was just that uncomfortable.
p300
aVAnd at that moment, the sun came out,
p301
aVand through this perforated screen,
p302
aVa pattern was cast over these bodies
p303
aVand they kind of faded into the rear,
p304
aVand we left the restaurant kind of
p305
aVfeeling O.K. about stuff.
p306
aa(lp307
VAnd I do think pattern
p308
aVhas the capability of eradicating
p309
aVsome of the most evil
p310
aVforces of society,
p311
aVsuch as bad form in restaurants,
p312
aVbut quite seriously, it was a statement to me
p313
aVthat one thing that you do, sort of, see
p314
aVis the aggressive nature
p315
aVof the industrial world has produced \u2014
p316
aVkind of,
p317
aVlarge masses of things,
p318
aVand when you \u2014 in monoculture,
p319
aVand I think the preservation of diversity in culture
p320
aVis something that's important to us.
p321
aa(lp322
VThe last shots that I have deal with \u2014
p323
aVcoming back to this theme of sidewalks,
p324
aVand I wanted to
p325
aVsay something here about \u2014 I'm, kind of, optimistic, you know.
p326
aVPost-Second World War,
p327
aVthe influence of the automobile
p328
aVhas really been devastating in a lot of our cities.
p329
aVA lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots
p330
aVin a sort of indiscriminate use.
p331
aVA lot of the planning departments became subordinated
p332
aVto the transportation department. It's as easy to rag on cars
p333
aVas it is on Wal-Mart;
p334
aVI'm not going to do that.
p335
aVBut they're real examples in urbanization
p336
aVand the change that's occurred in the last number of years,
p337
aVand the heightened sensitivity to the importance
p338
aVof our urban environments as cultural centers.
p339
aVI think that they are, that the statements that we make
p340
aVin this public sector
p341
aVare our contributions
p342
aVto a larger whole.
p343
aa(lp344
VCities are the place where we're most likely
p345
aVto encounter diversity
p346
aVand to mix with other people.
p347
aVWe go there for stimulation in art and all those other things.
p348
aVBut I think people have recognized
p349
aVthe sanctity of our urban areas.
p350
aVA place like Chicago
p351
aVhas really reached kind of a level of international stature.
p352
aVThe U.S. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of
p353
aVenlightened urban planning and renewal,
p354
aVand I want to single out a place like Chicago,
p355
aVwhere I look at some guy like Mayor Daley as a bit of a design hero
p356
aVfor being able to work through the
p357
aVpolitical processes and all that to improve an area.
p358
aVYou would expect a city like this to have
p359
aVupgraded flower boxes
p360
aVon Michigan Avenue where wealthy people shop,
p361
aVbut if you actually go along the street you find
p362
aVthe flower boxes change from street to street:
p363
aVthere's actual diversity in the plants.
p364
aVAnd the idea that a city group can maintain
p365
aVdifferent types of foliage
p366
aVis really quite exceptional.
p367
aa(lp368
VThere are common elements of this that you'll see throughout Chicago,
p369
aVand then there are your big-D design statements:
p370
aVthe Pritzker Pavilion done by Frank Gehry.
p371
aVMy measure of this as being an important bit of design
p372
aVis not so much the way that it looks,
p373
aVbut the fact that it performs a very important social function.
p374
aVThere are a lot of free concerts, for example,
p375
aVthat go on in this area;
p376
aVit has a phenomenal acoustic system.
p377
aVBut the commitment that the city has made to the public area
p378
aVis significant, and almost an international model.
p379
aVI work on the mayor's council in San Francisco,
p380
aVon the International Design Council for Mayors,
p381
aVand Chicago is looked at as the pinnacle,
p382
aVand I really would like to salute Mayor Daley and the folks there.
p383
aVI thought that I should include at least one
p384
aVshot of technology for you guys.
p385
aVThis is also in Millennium Park in Chicago,
p386
aVwhere the Spanish artist-designer Plensa
p387
aVhas created, kind of,
p388
aVa digital readout in this park
p389
aVthat reflects back
p390
aVthe characters and personalities
p391
aVof the people in this area.
p392
aVAnd it's a welcoming area, I think, inclusive of diversity,
p393
aVreflective of diversity, and I think
p394
aVthis marriage of both technology and art
p395
aVin the public sector is an area where the U.S.
p396
aVcan really take a leadership role,
p397
aVand Chicago is one example.
p398
