VIf you'd like to learn how to play the lobster, we have some here.
p4
aVAnd that's not a joke, we really do.
p5
aVSo come up afterwards and I'll show you how to play a lobster.
p6
aa(lp7
VSo, actually, I started working on what's called the mantis shrimp
p8
aVa few years ago because they make sound.
p9
aVThis is a recording I made of a mantis shrimp
p10
aVthat's found off the coast of California.
p11
aVAnd while that's an absolutely fascinating sound,
p12
aVit actually turns out to be a very difficult project.
p13
aVAnd while I was struggling to figure out how and why mantis shrimp,
p14
aVor stomatopods, make sound, I started to think about their appendages.
p15
aVAnd mantis shrimp are called "mantis shrimp" after the praying mantises,
p16
aVwhich also have a fast feeding appendage. And I started to think,
p17
aVwell, maybe it will be interesting, while listening to their sounds,
p18
aVto figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes.
p19
aVAnd so today I'll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike,
p20
aVwork that I've done in collaboration with Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo, mantis shrimp come in two varieties:
p23
aVthere are spearers and smashers.
p24
aVAnd this is a spearing mantis shrimp, or stomatopod.
p25
aVAnd he lives in the sand, and he catches things that go by overhead.
p26
aVSo, a quick strike like that. And if we slow it down a bit,
p27
aVthis is the mantis shrimp \u2014 the same species \u2014
p28
aVrecorded at 1,000 frames a second,
p29
aVplayed back at 15 frames per second.
p30
aVAnd you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs,
p31
aVexploding upward to actually just catch
p32
aVa dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it.
p33
aVNow, the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod,
p34
aVand these guys open up snails for a living.
p35
aVAnd so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VSo, I'll play it one more time.
p40
aVHe wiggles it in place, tugs it with his nose, and smash.
p41
aVAnd a few smashes later, the snail is broken open, and he's got a good dinner.
p42
aVSo, the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end,
p43
aVor it can smash with the heel.
p44
aVAnd today I'll talk about the smashing type of strike.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd so the first question that came to mind was,
p47
aVwell, how fast does this limb move?
p48
aVBecause it's moving pretty darn fast on that video.
p49
aVAnd I immediately came upon a problem.
p50
aVEvery single high-speed video system in the biology department
p51
aVat Berkeley wasn't fast enough to catch this movement.
p52
aVWe simply couldn't capture it on video.
p53
aVAnd so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time.
p54
aVAnd then a BBC crew came cruising through the biology department,
p55
aVlooking for a story to do about new technologies in biology.
p56
aVAnd so we struck up a deal.
p57
aVI said, "Well, if you guys rent the high-speed video system
p58
aVthat could capture these movements,
p59
aVyou guys can film us collecting the data."
p60
aVAnd believe it or not, they went for it. (Laughter)
p61
aVSo we got this incredible video system. It's very new technology \u2014
p62
aVit just came out about a year ago \u2014
p63
aVthat allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light.
p64
aVAnd low light is a critical issue with filming animals,
p65
aVbecause if it's too high, you fry them. (Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VSo this is a mantis shrimp. There are the eyes up here,
p68
aVand there's that raptorial appendage, and there's the heel.
p69
aVAnd that thing's going to swing around and smash the snail.
p70
aVAnd the snail's wired to a stick,
p71
aVso he's a little bit easier to set up the shot. And \u2014 yeah.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VI hope there aren't any snail rights activists around here.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VSo this was filmed at 5,000 frames per second,
p80
aVand I'm playing it back at 15. And so this is slowed down 333 times.
p81
aVAnd as you'll notice, it's still pretty gosh darn fast
p82
aVslowed down 333 times. It's an incredibly powerful movement.
p83
aVThe whole limb extends out. The body flexes backwards \u2014
p84
aVjust a spectacular movement.
p85
aVAnd so what we did is, we took a look at these videos,
p86
aVand we measured how fast the limb was moving
p87
aVto get back to that original question.
p88
aVAnd we were in for our first surprise.
p89
aVSo what we calculated was that the limbs were moving
p90
aVat the peak speed ranging from 10 meters per second
p91
aVall the way up to 23 meters per second.
p92
aVAnd for those of you who prefer miles per hour,
p93
aVthat's over 45 miles per hour in water. And this is really darn fast.
p94
aVIn fact, it's so fast we were able to add a new point
p95
aVon the extreme animal movement spectrum.
p96
aVAnd mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike
p97
aVof any animal system. So our first surprise.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Applause)
p100
aa(lp101
VSo that was really cool and very unexpected.
p102
aVSo, you might be wondering, well, how do they do it?
p103
aVAnd actually, this work was done in the 1960s
p104
aVby a famous biologist named Malcolm Burrows.
p105
aVAnd what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use
p106
aVwhat's called a "catch mechanism," or "click mechanism."
p107
aVAnd what this basically consists of is a large muscle
p108
aVthat takes a good long time to contract,
p109
aVand a latch that prevents anything from moving.
p110
aVSo the muscle contracts, and nothing happens.
p111
aVAnd once the muscle's contracted completely, everything's stored up \u2014
p112
aVthe latch flies upward, and you've got the movement.
p113
aVAnd that's basically what's called a "power amplification system."
p114
aVIt takes a long time for the muscle to contract,
p115
aVand a very short time for the limb to fly out.
p116
aVAnd so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story.
p117
aVThis was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes.
p118
aa(lp119
VBut then I took a trip to the National Museum of Natural History.
p120
aVAnd if any of you ever have a chance,
p121
aVbackstage of the National Museum of Natural History
p122
aVis one of the world's best collections of preserved mantis shrimp. And what \u2014
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
Vthis is serious business for me.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VSo, this \u2014 what I saw, on every single mantis shrimp limb,
p131
aVwhether it's a spearer or a smasher,
p132
aVis a beautiful saddle-shaped structure
p133
aVright on the top surface of the limb. And you can see it right here.
p134
aVIt just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse.
p135
aVIt's a very beautiful structure.
p136
aVAnd it's surrounded by membranous areas. And those membranous areas
p137
aVsuggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure.
p138
aVAnd this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while.
p139
aVAnd then we did a series of calculations, and what we were able to show
p140
aVis that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring.
p141
aVThere needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism
p142
aVin order to generate the amount of force that we observe,
p143
aVand the speed that we observe, and the output of the system.
p144
aVSo we thought, OK, this must be a spring \u2014
p145
aVthe saddle could very well be a spring.
p146
aVAnd we went back to those high-speed videos again,
p147
aVand we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending.
p148
aVAnd I'll just do that one more time.
p149
aVAnd then if you take a look at the video \u2014
p150
aVit's a little bit hard to see \u2014 it's outlined in yellow.
p151
aVThe saddle is outlined in yellow. You can actually see it
p152
aVextending over the course of the strike, and actually hyperextending.
p153
aVSo, we've had very solid evidence showing
p154
aVthat that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends,
p155
aVand does, in fact, function as a spring.
p156
aa(lp157
VThe saddle-shaped structure is also known as a "hyperbolic paraboloid surface,"
p158
aVor an "anticlastic surface."
p159
aVAnd this is very well known to engineers and architects,
p160
aVbecause it's a very strong surface in compression.
p161
aVIt has curves in two directions,
p162
aVone curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other,
p163
aVso any kind of perturbation spreads the forces
p164
aVover the surface of this type of shape.
p165
aVSo it's very well known to engineers, not as well known to biologists.
p166
aVIt's also known to quite a few people who make jewelry,
p167
aVbecause it requires very little material
p168
aVto build this type of surface, and it's very strong.
p169
aVSo if you're going to build a thin gold structure,
p170
aVit's very nice to have it in a shape that's strong.
p171
aa(lp172
VNow, it's also known to architects. One of the most famous architects
p173
aVis Eduardo Catalano, who popularized this structure.
p174
aVAnd what's shown here is a saddle-shaped roof that he built
p175
aVthat's 87 and a half feet spanwise.
p176
aVIt's two and a half inches thick, and supported at two points.
p177
aVAnd one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's \u2014
p178
aVhe found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure
p179
aVthat's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points.
p180
aVAnd all of these are the same principles that apply
p181
aVto the saddle-shaped spring in stomatopods.
p182
aVIn biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot
p183
aVof extra material requirements for building it.
p184
aVSo, very interesting parallels between the biological
p185
aVand the engineering worlds. And interestingly, this turns out \u2014
p186
aVthe stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first
p187
aVdescribed biological hyperbolic paraboloid spring.
p188
aVThat's a bit long, but it is sort of interesting.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo the next and final question was, well, how much force
p191
aVdoes a mantis shrimp produce if they're able to break open snails?
p192
aVAnd so I wired up what's called a load cell.
p193
aVA load cell measures forces, and this is actually
p194
aVa piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it.
p195
aVAnd when this crystal is squeezed, the electrical properties change
p196
aVand it \u2014 which \u2014 in proportion to the forces that go in.
p197
aVSo these animals are wonderfully aggressive,
p198
aVand are really hungry all the time. And so all I had to do
p199
aVwas actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell,
p200
aVand they'd smash away at it.
p201
aVAnd so this is just a regular video of the animal
p202
aVjust smashing the heck out of this load cell.
p203
aVAnd we were able to get some force measurements out.
p204
aVAnd again, we were in for a surprise.
p205
aa(lp206
VI purchased a 100-pound load cell, thinking,
p207
aVno animal could produce more than 100 pounds at this size of an animal.
p208
aVAnd what do you know? They immediately overloaded the load cell.
p209
aVSo these are actually some old data
p210
aVwhere I had to find the smallest animals in the lab,
p211
aVand we were able to measure forces of well over 100 pounds
p212
aVgenerated by an animal about this big.
p213
aVAnd actually, just last week I got a 300-pound load cell
p214
aVup and running, and I've clocked these animals generating
p215
aVwell over 200 pounds of force.
p216
aVAnd again, I think this will be a world record.
p217
aVI have to do a little bit more background reading,
p218
aVbut I think this will be the largest amount of force produced
p219
aVby an animal of a given \u2014 per body mass. So, really incredible forces.
p220
aVAnd again, that brings us back to the importance of that spring
p221
aVin storing up and releasing so much energy in this system.
p222
aVBut that was not the end of the story.
p223
aa(lp224
VNow, things \u2014 I'm making this sound very easy, this is actually a lot of work.
p225
aVAnd I got all these force measurements,
p226
aVand then I went and looked at the force output of the system.
p227
aVAnd this is just very simple \u2014 time is on the X-axis
p228
aVand the force is on the Y-axis. And you can see two peaks.
p229
aVAnd that was what really got me puzzled.
p230
aVThe first peak, obviously, is the limb hitting the load cell.
p231
aVBut there's a really large second peak half a millisecond later,
p232
aVand I didn't know what that was.
p233
aVSo now, you'd expect a second peak for other reasons,
p234
aVbut not half a millisecond later.
p235
aVAgain, going back to those high-speed videos,
p236
aVthere's a pretty good hint of what might be going on.
p237
aVHere's that same orientation that we saw earlier.
p238
aVThere's that raptorial appendage \u2014 there's the heel,
p239
aVand it's going to swing around and hit the load cell.
p240
aVAnd what I'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this,
p241
aVon the surface of the load cell, as the limb comes flying through.
p242
aVAnd I hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light.
p243
aa(lp244
VAudience: Wow.
p245
aa(lp246
VSheila Patek: And so if we just take that one frame, what you can actually see there
p247
aVat the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble.
p248
aVAnd what that is, is cavitation.
p249
aVAnd cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon
p250
aVwhich occurs when you have areas of water
p251
aVmoving at extremely different speeds.
p252
aVAnd when this happens, it can cause areas of very low pressure,
p253
aVwhich results in the water literally vaporizing.
p254
aVAnd when that vapor bubble collapses, it emits sound, light and heat,
p255
aVand it's a very destructive process.
p256
aVAnd so here it is in the stomatopod. And again, this is a situation
p257
aVwhere engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon,
p258
aVbecause it destroys boat propellers.
p259
aVPeople have been struggling for years to try and design
p260
aVa very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate
p261
aVand literally wear away the metal and put holes in it,
p262
aVjust like these pictures show.
p263
aa(lp264
VSo this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further,
p265
aVI'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail.
p266
aVThis is taken at 20,000 frames per second, and I have to give
p267
aVfull credit to the BBC cameraman, Tim Green, for setting this shot up,
p268
aVbecause I could never have done this in a million years \u2014
p269
aVone of the benefits of working with professional cameramen.
p270
aVYou can see it coming in, and an incredible flash of light,
p271
aVand all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail.
p272
aVSo really, just an amazing image,
p273
aVslowed down extremely, to extremely slow speeds.
p274
aVAnd again, we can see it in slightly different form there,
p275
aVwith the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces.
p276
aVIn fact, you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb.
p277
aa(lp278
VSo to solve this quandary of the two force peaks:
p279
aVwhat I think was going on is: that first impact is actually
p280
aVthe limb hitting the load cell, and the second impact is actually
p281
aVthe collapse of the cavitation bubble.
p282
aVAnd these animals may very well be making use of
p283
aVnot only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring,
p284
aVbut the extremes of the fluid dynamics. And they might actually be
p285
aVmaking use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail.
p286
aVSo, really fascinating double whammy, so to speak, from these animals.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo, one question I often get after this talk \u2014
p289
aVso I figured I'd answer it now \u2014 is, well, what happens to the animal?
p290
aVBecause obviously, if it's breaking snails,
p291
aVthe poor limb must be disintegrating. And indeed it does.
p292
aVThat's the smashing part of the heel on both these images,
p293
aVand it gets worn away. In fact, I've seen them wear away
p294
aVtheir heel all the way to the flesh.
p295
aVBut one of the convenient things about being an arthropod
p296
aVis that you have to molt. And every three months or so
p297
aVthese animals molt, and they build a new limb and it's no problem.
p298
aVVery, very convenient solution to that particular problem.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo, I'd like to end on sort of a wacky note.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
VMaybe this is all wacky to folks like you, I don't know.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VSo, the saddles \u2014 that saddle-shaped spring \u2014
p309
aVhas actually been well known to biologists for a long time,
p310
aVnot as a spring but as a visual signal.
p311
aVAnd there's actually a spectacular colored dot
p312
aVin the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods.
p313
aVAnd this is quite interesting, to find evolutionary origins
p314
aVof visual signals on what's really, in all species, their spring.
p315
aVAnd I think one explanation for this could be
p316
aVgoing back to the molting phenomenon.
p317
aa(lp318
VSo these animals go into a molting period where they're
p319
aVunable to strike \u2014 their bodies become very soft.
p320
aVAnd they're literally unable to strike or they will self-destruct.
p321
aVThis is for real. And what they do is, up until that time period
p322
aVwhen they can't strike, they become really obnoxious and awful,
p323
aVand they strike everything in sight; it doesn't matter who or what.
p324
aVAnd the second they get into that time point when they can't strike any more,
p325
aVthey just signal. They wave their legs around.
p326
aVAnd it's one of the classic examples in animal behavior of bluffing.
p327
aVIt's a well-established fact of these animals
p328
aVthat they actually bluff. They can't actually strike, but they pretend to.
p329
aVAnd so I'm very curious about whether those colored dots
p330
aVin the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information
p331
aVabout their ability to strike, or their strike force,
p332
aVand something about the time period in the molting cycle.
p333
aVSo sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure
p334
aVright in the middle of their spring.
p335
aa(lp336
VSo to conclude, I mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators,
p337
aVWyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell, who worked closely with me on this.
p338
aVAnd also the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science,
p339
aVwhich gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time,
p340
aVand for that I'm very grateful. Thank you very much.
