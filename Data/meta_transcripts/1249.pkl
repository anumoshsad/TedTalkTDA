VWhy can't we solve these problems?
p4
aVWe know what they are.
p5
aVSomething always seems to stop us.
p6
aVWhy?
p7
aVI remember March the 15th, 2000.
p8
aVThe B15 iceberg broke off the Ross Ice Shelf.
p9
aVIn the newspaper it said
p10
aV"it was all part of a normal process."
p11
aVA little bit further on in the article
p12
aVit said "a loss that would normally take
p13
aVthe ice shelf 50-100 years to replace."
p14
aVThat same word, "normal,"
p15
aVhad two different,
p16
aValmost opposite meanings.
p17
aa(lp18
VIf we walk into the B15 iceberg
p19
aVwhen we leave here today,
p20
aVwe're going to bump into something
p21
aVa thousand feet tall,
p22
aV76 miles long,
p23
aV17 miles wide,
p24
aVand it's going to weigh two gigatons.
p25
aVI'm sorry, there's nothing normal about this.
p26
aVAnd yet I think it's this perspective of us
p27
aVas humans to look at our world
p28
aVthrough the lens of normal
p29
aVis one of the forces
p30
aVthat stops us developing real solutions.
p31
aVOnly 90 days after this,
p32
aVarguably the greatest discovery
p33
aVof the last century occurred.
p34
aVIt was the sequencing for the first time
p35
aVof the human genome.
p36
aVThis is the code that's in every single one
p37
aVof our 50 trillion cells
p38
aVthat makes us who we are and what we are.
p39
aVAnd if we just take one cell's worth
p40
aVof this code and unwind it,
p41
aVit's a meter long,
p42
aVtwo nanometers thick.
p43
aVTwo nanometers is 20 atoms in thickness.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd I wondered,
p46
aVwhat if the answer to some of our biggest problems
p47
aVcould be found in the smallest of places,
p48
aVwhere the difference between what is
p49
aVvaluable and what is worthless
p50
aVis merely the addition or subtraction
p51
aVof a few atoms?
p52
aVAnd what
p53
aVif we could get exquisite control
p54
aVover the essence of energy,
p55
aVthe electron?
p56
aVSo I started to go around the world
p57
aVfinding the best and brightest scientists
p58
aVI could at universities
p59
aVwhose collective discoveries have the chance
p60
aVto take us there,
p61
aVand we formed a company to build
p62
aVon their extraordinary ideas.
p63
aa(lp64
VSix and a half years later,
p65
aVa hundred and eighty researchers,
p66
aVthey have some amazing developments
p67
aVin the lab,
p68
aVand I will show you three of those today,
p69
aVsuch that we can stop burning up our planet
p70
aVand instead,
p71
aVwe can generate all the energy we need
p72
aVright where we are,
p73
aVcleanly, safely, and cheaply.
p74
aVThink of the space that we spend
p75
aVmost of our time.
p76
aVA tremendous amount of energy
p77
aVis coming at us from the sun.
p78
aVWe like the light that comes into the room,
p79
aVbut in the middle of summer,
p80
aVall that heat is coming into the room
p81
aVthat we're trying to keep cool.
p82
aVIn winter, exactly the opposite is happening.
p83
aVWe're trying to heat up
p84
aVthe space that we're in,
p85
aVand all that is trying to get out through the window.
p86
aa(lp87
VWouldn't it be really great
p88
aVif the window could flick back the heat
p89
aVinto the room if we needed it
p90
aVor flick it away before it came in?
p91
aVOne of the materials that can do this
p92
aVis a remarkable material, carbon,
p93
aVthat has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction
p94
aVwhere graphite is blasted by a vapor,
p95
aVand when the vaporized carbon condenses,
p96
aVit condenses back into a different form:
p97
aVchickenwire rolled up.
p98
aVBut this chickenwire carbon,
p99
aVcalled a carbon nanotube,
p100
aVis a hundred thousand times smaller
p101
aVthan the width of one of your hairs.
p102
aVIt's a thousand times
p103
aVmore conductive than copper.
p104
aVHow is that possible?
p105
aVOne of the things about working at the nanoscale
p106
aVis things look and act very differently.
p107
aVYou think of carbon as black.
p108
aVCarbon at the nanoscale
p109
aVis actually transparent
p110
aVand flexible.
p111
aVAnd when it's in this form,
p112
aVif I combine it with a polymer
p113
aVand affix it to your window
p114
aVwhen it's in its colored state,
p115
aVit will reflect away all heat and light,
p116
aVand when it's in its bleached state
p117
aVit will let all the light and heat through
p118
aVand any combination in between.
p119
aVTo change its state, by the way,
p120
aVtakes two volts from a millisecond pulse.
p121
aVAnd once you've changed its state, it stays there
p122
aVuntil you change its state again.
p123
aa(lp124
VAs we were working on this incredible
p125
aVdiscovery at University of Florida,
p126
aVwe were told to go down the corridor
p127
aVto visit another scientist,
p128
aVand he was working
p129
aVon a pretty incredible thing.
p130
aVImagine
p131
aVif we didn't have to rely
p132
aVon artificial lighting to get around at night.
p133
aVWe'd have to see at night, right?
p134
aVThis lets you do it.
p135
aVIt's a nanomaterial, two nanomaterials,
p136
aVa detector and an imager.
p137
aVThe total width of it
p138
aVis 600 times smaller
p139
aVthan the width of a decimal place.
p140
aVAnd it takes all the infrared available at night,
p141
aVconverts it into an electron
p142
aVin the space of two small films,
p143
aVand is enabling you to play an image
p144
aVwhich you can see through.
p145
aVI'm going to show to TEDsters,
p146
aVthe first time, this operating.
p147
aVFirstly I'm going to show you
p148
aVthe transparency.
p149
aVTransparency is key.
p150
aVIt's a film that you can look through.
p151
aVAnd then I'm going to turn the lights out.
p152
aVAnd you can see, off a tiny film,
p153
aVincredible clarity.
p154
aa(lp155
VAs we were working on this, it dawned on us:
p156
aVthis is taking infrared radiation, wavelengths,
p157
aVand converting it into electrons.
p158
aVWhat if we combined it
p159
aVwith this?
p160
aVSuddenly you've converted energy
p161
aVinto an electron on a plastic surface
p162
aVthat you can stick on your window.
p163
aVBut because it's flexible,
p164
aVit can be on any surface whatsoever.
p165
aVThe power plant of tomorrow
p166
aVis no power plant.
p167
aVWe talked about generating and using.
p168
aVWe want to talk about storing energy,
p169
aVand unfortunately
p170
aVthe best thing we've got going
p171
aVis something that was developed in France
p172
aVa hundred and fifty years ago,
p173
aVthe lead acid battery.
p174
aVIn terms of dollars per what's stored,
p175
aVit's simply the best.
p176
aa(lp177
VKnowing that we're not going to put fifty of
p178
aVthese in our basements to store our power,
p179
aVwe went to a group at University of Texas at Dallas,
p180
aVand we gave them this diagram.
p181
aVIt was in actually a diner
p182
aVoutside of Dallas/Fort Worth Airport.
p183
aVWe said, "Could you build this?"
p184
aVAnd these scientists,
p185
aVinstead of laughing at us, said, "Yeah."
p186
aVAnd what they built was eBox.
p187
aVEBox is testing new nanomaterials
p188
aVto park an electron on the outside,
p189
aVhold it until you need it,
p190
aVand then be able to release it and pass it off.
p191
aVBeing able to do that means
p192
aVthat I can generate energy
p193
aVcleanly, efficiently and cheaply
p194
aVright where I am.
p195
aVIt's my energy.
p196
aVAnd if I don't need it, I can convert it
p197
aVback up on the window
p198
aVto energy, light, and beam it,
p199
aVline of site, to your place.
p200
aVAnd for that I do not need
p201
aVan electric grid between us.
p202
aa(lp203
VThe grid of tomorrow is no grid,
p204
aVand energy, clean efficient energy,
p205
aVwill one day be free.
p206
aVIf you do this, you get the last puzzle piece,
p207
aVwhich is water.
p208
aVEach of us, every day,
p209
aVneed just eight glasses of this,
p210
aVbecause we're human.
p211
aVWhen we run out of water,
p212
aVas we are in some parts of the world
p213
aVand soon to be in other parts of the world,
p214
aVwe're going to have to get this from the sea,
p215
aVand that's going to require us to build desalination plants.
p216
aV19 trillion dollars is what we're going to have to spend.
p217
aVThese also require tremendous amounts of energy.
p218
aVIn fact, it's going to require twice the world's
p219
aVsupply of oil to run the pumps
p220
aVto generate the water.
p221
aVWe're simply not going to do that.
p222
aVBut in a world where energy is freed
p223
aVand transmittable
p224
aVeasily and cheaply, we can take any water
p225
aVwherever we are
p226
aVand turn it into whatever we need.
p227
aa(lp228
VI'm glad to be working with
p229
aVincredibly brilliant and kind scientists,
p230
aVno kinder than
p231
aVmany of the people in the world,
p232
aVbut they have a magic look at the world.
p233
aVAnd I'm glad to see their discoveries
p234
aVcoming out of the lab and into the world.
p235
aVIt's been a long time in coming for me.
p236
aV18 years ago,
p237
aVI saw a photograph in the paper.
p238
aVIt was taken by Kevin Carter
p239
aVwho went to the Sudan
p240
aVto document their famine there.
p241
aVI've carried this photograph with me
p242
aVevery day since then.
p243
aVIt's a picture of a little girl dying of thirst.
p244
aVBy any standard this is wrong.
p245
aVIt's just wrong.
p246
aVWe can do better than this.
p247
aVWe should do better than this.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd whenever I go round
p250
aVto somebody who says,
p251
aV"You know what, you're working on something that's too difficult.
p252
aVIt'll never happen. You don't have enough money.
p253
aVYou don't have enough time.
p254
aVThere's something much more interesting around the corner,"
p255
aVI say, "Try saying that to her."
p256
aVThat's what I say in my mind. And I just say
p257
aV"thank you," and I go on to the next one.
p258
aVThis is why we have to solve our problems,
p259
aVand I know the answer as to how
p260
aVis to be able to get exquisite control
p261
aVover a building block of nature,
p262
aVthe stuff of life:
p263
aVthe simple electron.
p264
aa(lp265
