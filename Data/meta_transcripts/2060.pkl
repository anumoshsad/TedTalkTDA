VI'm a teacher and a practitioner
p4
aVof civics in America.
p5
aVNow, I will kindly ask those of you who have just fallen asleep
p6
aVto please wake up. (Laughter)
p7
aVWhy is it that the very word "civics"
p8
aVhas such a soporific,  even a narcoleptic effect
p9
aVon us?
p10
aVI think it's because the very  word signifies something
p11
aVexceedingly virtuous,  exceedingly important,
p12
aVand exceedingly boring.
p13
aVWell, I think it's the responsibility of people like us,
p14
aVpeople who show up for gatherings like this
p15
aVin person or online, in any way we can,
p16
aVto make civics sexy again,
p17
aVas sexy as it was during the American Revolution,
p18
aVas sexy as it was during the Civil Rights Movement.
p19
aVAnd I believe the way we make civics sexy again
p20
aVis to make explicitly about the teaching of power.
p21
aVThe way we do that, I believe,
p22
aVis at the level of the city.
p23
aa(lp24
VThis is what I want to talk about today,
p25
aVand I want to start by defining some terms
p26
aVand then I want to describe the scale
p27
aVof the problem I think we face
p28
aVand then suggest the ways that I believe cities
p29
aVcan be the seat of the solution.
p30
aVSo let me start with some definitions.
p31
aVBy civics, I simply mean the art
p32
aVof being a pro-social, problem-solving contributor
p33
aVin a self-governing community.
p34
aVCivics is the art of citizenship,
p35
aVwhat Bill Gates Sr. calls simply
p36
aVshowing up for life,
p37
aVand it encompasses three things:
p38
aVa foundation of values,
p39
aVan understanding of the systems that make the world go round,
p40
aVand a set of skills
p41
aVthat allow you to pursue goals
p42
aVand to have others join in that pursuit.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd that brings me to my definition of power,
p45
aVwhich is simply this:
p46
aVthe capacity to make others do
p47
aVwhat you would have them do.
p48
aVIt sounds menacing, doesn't it?
p49
aVWe don't like to talk about power.
p50
aVWe find it scary. We find it somehow evil.
p51
aVWe feel uncomfortable naming it.
p52
aVIn the culture and mythology of democracy,
p53
aVpower resides with the people.
p54
aVPeriod. End of story.
p55
aVAny further inquiry not necessary
p56
aVand not really that welcome.
p57
aVPower has a negative moral valence.
p58
aVIt sounds Machiavellian inherently.
p59
aVIt seems inherently evil.
p60
aVBut in fact power is no more inherently good or evil
p61
aVthan fire or physics.
p62
aVIt just is.
p63
aVAnd power governs
p64
aVhow any form of government operates,
p65
aVwhether a democracy or a dictatorship.
p66
aVAnd the problem we face today, here in America in particular,
p67
aVbut all around the world,
p68
aVis that far too many people  are profoundly illiterate
p69
aVin power \u2014
p70
aVwhat it is, who has it,
p71
aVhow it operates, how it flows,
p72
aVwhat part of it is visible,  what part of it is not,
p73
aVwhy some people have it,  why that's compounded.
p74
aVAnd as a result of this illiteracy,
p75
aVthose few who do understand
p76
aVhow power operates in civic life,
p77
aVthose who understand
p78
aVhow a bill becomes a law, yes,
p79
aVbut also how a friendship  becomes a subsidy,
p80
aVor how a bias becomes a policy,
p81
aVor how a slogan becomes a movement,
p82
aVthe people who understand those things
p83
aVwield disproportionate influence,
p84
aVand they're perfectly happy
p85
aVto fill the vacuum created by the ignorance
p86
aVof the great majority.
p87
aa(lp88
VThis is why it is so fundamental for us right now
p89
aVto grab hold of this idea of power
p90
aVand to democratize it.
p91
aVOne of the things that is so profoundly exciting
p92
aVand challenging about this moment
p93
aVis that as a result of this power illiteracy
p94
aVthat is so pervasive,
p95
aVthere is a concentration
p96
aVof knowledge, of understanding, of clout.
p97
aVI mean, think about it:
p98
aVHow does a friendship become a subsidy?
p99
aVSeamlessly,
p100
aVwhen a senior government official decides
p101
aVto leave government and become a lobbyist
p102
aVfor a private interest
p103
aVand convert his or her relationships into capital
p104
aVfor their new masters.
p105
aVHow does a bias become a policy?
p106
aVInsidiously, just the way that
p107
aVstop-and-frisk, for instance,
p108
aVbecame over time a bureaucratic numbers game.
p109
aVHow does a slogan become a movement?
p110
aVVirally, in the way that the Tea Party, for instance,
p111
aVwas able to take the "Don't Tread on Me" flag
p112
aVfrom the American Revolution,
p113
aVor how, on the other side,
p114
aVa band of activists could take a magazine headline,
p115
aV"Occupy Wall Street,"
p116
aVand turn that into a global meme and movement.
p117
aVThe thing is, though, most people
p118
aVaren't looking for and don't want to see these realities.
p119
aVSo much of this ignorance, this civic illiteracy,
p120
aVis willful.
p121
aVThere are some millennials, for instance,
p122
aVwho think the whole business is just sordid.
p123
aVThey don't want to have anything to do with politics.
p124
aVThey'd rather just opt out
p125
aVand engage in volunteerism.
p126
aVThere are some techies out there
p127
aVwho believe that the cure-all
p128
aVfor any power imbalance or power abuse
p129
aVis simply more data,
p130
aVmore transparency.
p131
aVThere are some on the left who think power resides
p132
aVonly with corporations,
p133
aVand some on the right who think power
p134
aVresides only with government,
p135
aVeach side blinded by their selective outrage.
p136
aVThere are the naive who believe that
p137
aVgood things just happen
p138
aVand the cynical who believe that bad things just happen,
p139
aVthe fortunate and unfortunate alike
p140
aVwho think that their lot is simply what they deserve
p141
aVrather than the eminently alterable result
p142
aVof a prior arrangement, an inherited allocation,
p143
aVof power.
p144
aa(lp145
VAs a result of all of this creeping fatalism in public life,
p146
aVwe here, particularly in America today,
p147
aVhave depressingly low levels
p148
aVof civic knowledge, civic engagement, participation,
p149
aVawareness.
p150
aVThe whole business of politics has been
p151
aVeffectively subcontracted out to a band of professionals,
p152
aVmoney people, outreach people,
p153
aVmessage people, research people.
p154
aVThe rest of us are meant to feel like amateurs
p155
aVin the sense of suckers.
p156
aVWe become demotivated to learn more
p157
aVabout how things work.
p158
aVWe begin to opt out.
p159
aa(lp160
VWell, this problem, this challenge,
p161
aVis a thing that we must now confront,
p162
aVand I believe that when you have
p163
aVthis kind of disengagement, this willful ignorance,
p164
aVit becomes both a cause and a consequence
p165
aVof this concentration of opportunity
p166
aVof wealth and clout that I was describing a moment ago,
p167
aVthis profound civic inequality.
p168
aVThis is why it is so important in our time right now
p169
aVto reimagine civics as the teaching of power.
p170
aVPerhaps it's never been more important
p171
aVat any time in our lifetimes.
p172
aVIf people don't learn power,
p173
aVpeople don't wake up,
p174
aVand if they don't wake up,
p175
aVthey get left out.
p176
aa(lp177
VNow, part of the art of practicing power
p178
aVmeans being awake and having a voice,
p179
aVbut it also is about having an arena
p180
aVwhere you can plausibly practice deciding.
p181
aVAll of civics boils down to the simple question
p182
aVof who decides,
p183
aVand you have to play that out
p184
aVin a place, in an arena.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd this brings me to the third point that I want to make today,
p187
aVwhich is simply that there is no better arena
p188
aVin our time for the practicing of power
p189
aVthan the city.
p190
aVThink about the city where you live,
p191
aVwhere you're from.
p192
aVThink about a problem in the common life of your city.
p193
aVIt can be something small,
p194
aVlike where a street lamp should go,
p195
aVor something medium like
p196
aVwhich library should have its hours extended or cut,
p197
aVor maybe something bigger,
p198
aVlike whether a dilapidated waterfront should be
p199
aVturned into a highway or a greenway,
p200
aVor whether all the businesses in your town
p201
aVshould be required to pay a living wage.
p202
aVThink about the change that you want in your city,
p203
aVand then think about how you would get it,
p204
aVhow you would make it happen.
p205
aVTake an inventory of all the forms of power
p206
aVthat are at play in your city's situation:
p207
aVmoney, of course, people, yes,
p208
aVideas, information, misinformation,
p209
aVthe threat of force, the force of norms.
p210
aVAll of these form of power are at play.
p211
aVNow think about how you would activate
p212
aVor perhaps neutralize these various forms of power.
p213
aa(lp214
VThis is not some Game of Thrones
p215
aVempire-level set of questions.
p216
aVThese are questions that play out
p217
aVin every single place on the planet.
p218
aVI'll just tell you quickly about two stories
p219
aVdrawn from recent headlines.
p220
aVIn Boulder, Colorado,
p221
aVvoters not too long ago approved a process
p222
aVto replace the private power company,
p223
aVliterally the power company, the electric company Xcel,
p224
aVwith a publicly owned utility
p225
aVthat would forego profits
p226
aVand attend far more to climate change.
p227
aVWell, Xcel fought back,
p228
aVand Xcel has now put in play a ballot measure
p229
aVthat would undermine or undo
p230
aVthis municipalization.
p231
aVAnd so the citizen activists in Boulder who have been pushing this
p232
aVnow literally have to fight the power
p233
aVin order to fight for power.
p234
aVIn Tuscaloosa, at the University of Alabama,
p235
aVthere's an organization on campus
p236
aVcalled, kind of menacingly, the Machine,
p237
aVand it draws from largely white sororities
p238
aVand fraternities on campus,
p239
aVand for decades, the Machine has dominated
p240
aVstudent government elections.
p241
aVWell now, recently, the Machine
p242
aVhas started to get involved
p243
aVin actual city politics,
p244
aVand they've engineered the election
p245
aVof a former Machine member,
p246
aVa young, pro-business recent graduate
p247
aVto the Tuscaloosa city school board.
p248
aVNow, as I say, these are just two examples
p249
aVdrawn almost at random from the headlines.
p250
aVEvery day, there are thousands more like them.
p251
aVAnd you may like or dislike
p252
aVthe efforts I'm describing here
p253
aVin Boulder or in Tuscaloosa,
p254
aVbut you cannot help but admire
p255
aVthe power literacy of the players involved,
p256
aVtheir skill.
p257
aVYou cannot help but reckon with and recognize
p258
aVthe command they have
p259
aVof the elemental questions
p260
aVof civic power \u2014
p261
aVwhat objective, what strategy, what tactics,
p262
aVwhat is the terrain, who are your enemies,
p263
aVwho are your allies?
p264
aa(lp265
VNow I want you to return
p266
aVto thinking about that problem or that opportunity
p267
aVor that challenge in your city,
p268
aVand the thing it was that you want to fix
p269
aVor create in your city,
p270
aVand ask yourself,
p271
aVdo you have command of these elemental questions of power?
p272
aVCould you put into practice effectively
p273
aVwhat it is that you know?
p274
aVThis is the challenge and the opportunity for us.
p275
aa(lp276
VWe live in a time right now
p277
aVwhere in spite of globalization
p278
aVor perhaps because of globalization,
p279
aVall citizenship is ever more resonantly,
p280
aVpowerfully local.
p281
aVIndeed, power in our time is flowing
p282
aVever faster to the city.
p283
aVHere in the United States, the national government
p284
aVhas tied itself up in partisan knots.
p285
aVCivic imagination and innovation and creativity
p286
aVare emerging from local ecosystems now
p287
aVand radiating outward,
p288
aVand this great innovation,
p289
aVthis great wave
p290
aVof localism that's now arriving,
p291
aVand you see it in how people eat
p292
aVand work and share and buy and move
p293
aVand live their everyday lives,
p294
aVthis isn't some precious parochialism,
p295
aVthis isn't some retreat into insularity, no.
p296
aVThis is emergent.
p297
aVThe localism of our time is networked powerfully.
p298
aVAnd so, for instance,
p299
aVconsider the ways that strategies
p300
aVfor making cities more bike-friendly
p301
aVhave spread so rapidly from Copenhagen
p302
aVto New York to Austin to Boston to Seattle.
p303
aVThink about how experiments in participatory budgeting,
p304
aVwhere everyday citizens get a chance
p305
aVto allocate and decide upon
p306
aVthe allocation of city funds.
p307
aVThose experiments have spread from Porto Alegre, Brazil
p308
aVto here in New York City,  to the wards of Chicago.
p309
aVMigrant workers from Rome to Los Angeles
p310
aVand many cities between
p311
aVare now organizing to stage strikes
p312
aVto remind the people who live in their cities
p313
aVwhat a day without immigrants would look like.
p314
aVIn China, all across that country,
p315
aVmembers of the New Citizens' Movement
p316
aVare beginning to activate and organize
p317
aVto fight official corruption and graft,
p318
aVand they're drawing the ire of officials there,
p319
aVbut they're also drawing the attention
p320
aVof anti-corruption activists all around the world.
p321
aVIn Seattle, where I'm from,
p322
aVwe've become part of a great global array of cities
p323
aVthat are now working together
p324
aVbypassing government altogether,
p325
aVnational government altogether,
p326
aVin order to try to meet the carbon reduction goals
p327
aVof the Kyoto Protocol.
p328
aVAll of these citizens, united,
p329
aVare forming a web,
p330
aVa great archipelago of power
p331
aVthat allows us to bypass
p332
aVbrokenness and monopolies of control.
p333
aa(lp334
VAnd our task now is to accelerate this work.
p335
aVOur task now is to bring more and more people
p336
aVinto the fold of this work.
p337
aVThat's why my organization, Citizen University,
p338
aVhas undertaken a project now
p339
aVto create an everyman's curriculum
p340
aVin civic power.
p341
aVAnd this curriculum starts with this triad
p342
aVthat I described earlier of values,
p343
aVsystems and skills.
p344
aVAnd what I'd like to do is to invite all of you
p345
aVto help create this curriculum
p346
aVwith the stories and the experiences
p347
aVand the challenges that each of you lives and faces,
p348
aVto create something powerfully collective.
p349
aVAnd I want to invite you in particular to try
p350
aVa simple exercise drawn
p351
aVfrom the early frameworks of this curriculum.
p352
aVI want you to write a narrative,
p353
aVa narrative from the future of your city,
p354
aVand you can date it, set it out one year from now,
p355
aVfive years from now, a decade from now,
p356
aVa generation from now,
p357
aVand write it as a case study looking back,
p358
aVlooking back at the change
p359
aVthat you wanted in your city,
p360
aVlooking back at the cause that you were championing,
p361
aVand describing the ways that that change
p362
aVand that cause came, in fact, to succeed.
p363
aVDescribe the values
p364
aVof your fellow citizens that you activated,
p365
aVand the sense of moral purpose that you were able to stir.
p366
aVRecount all the different ways
p367
aVthat you engaged the systems of government,
p368
aVof the marketplace,
p369
aVof social institutions, of faith organizations,
p370
aVof the media.
p371
aVCatalog all the skills you had to deploy,
p372
aVhow to negotiate, how to advocate,
p373
aVhow to frame issues,
p374
aVhow to navigate diversity in conflict,
p375
aVall those skills that enabled you
p376
aVto bring folks on board
p377
aVand to overcome resistance.
p378
aVWhat you'll be doing when you write that narrative
p379
aVis you'll be discovering how to read power,
p380
aVand in the process, how to write power.
p381
aVSo share what you write,
p382
aVdo you what you write,
p383
aVand then share what you do.
p384
aVI invite you to literally share
p385
aVthe narratives that you create
p386
aVon our Facebook page for Citizen University.
p387
aVBut even beyond that, it's in the conversations
p388
aVthat we have today
p389
aVall around the world in the simultaneous gatherings
p390
aVthat are happening on this topic at this moment,
p391
aVand to think about how we can become
p392
aVone another's teachers and students in power.
p393
aVIf we do that, then together
p394
aVwe can make civics sexy again.
p395
aVTogether, we can democratize democracy
p396
aVand make it safe again for amateurs.
p397
aVTogether, we can create a great network of city
p398
aVthat will be the most powerful collective laboratory
p399
aVfor self-government this planet has ever seen.
p400
aVWe have the power to do that.
