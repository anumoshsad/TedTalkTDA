VThis is the ocean as I used to know it.
p4
aVAnd I find that since I've been in the Gulf a couple of times,
p5
aVI really kind of am traumatized because whenever I look at the ocean now,
p6
aVno matter where I am,
p7
aVeven where I know that none of the oil has gone,
p8
aVI sort of see slicks,
p9
aVand I'm finding that I'm very much haunted by it.
p10
aVBut what I want to talk to you about today
p11
aVis a lot of things that try to put all of this in context,
p12
aVnot just about the oil eruption, but what it means and why it has happened.
p13
aa(lp14
VFirst, just a little bit about me.
p15
aVI'm basically just a guy that likes to go fishing
p16
aVever since I was a little kid, and because I did,
p17
aVI wound up studying sea birds
p18
aVto try to stay in the coastal habitats that I so loved.
p19
aVAnd now I mainly write books about how the ocean is changing,
p20
aVand the ocean is certainly changing very rapidly.
p21
aVNow we saw this graphic earlier on, that we really live on a hard marble
p22
aVthat has just a slight bit of wetness to it.
p23
aVIt's like you dipped a marble in water.
p24
aVAnd the same thing with the atmosphere:
p25
aVIf you took all the atmosphere and rolled it up in a ball,
p26
aVyou would get that little sphere of gas on the right.
p27
aVSo we live on the most fragile little soap bubble you can imagine,
p28
aVa very sacred soap bubble, but one that is very, very easy to affect.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd all the burning of oil and coal and gas, all the fossil fuels,
p31
aVhave changed the atmosphere greatly.
p32
aVCarbon dioxide level has gone up and up and up.
p33
aVWe're warming the climate.
p34
aVSo the blowout in the Gulf
p35
aVis just a little piece of a much larger problem
p36
aVthat we have with the energy that we use to run civilization.
p37
aVBeyond warming,
p38
aVwe have the problem of the oceans getting more acidified \u2014
p39
aVand already measurably so, and already affecting animals.
p40
aVNow in the laboratory, if you take a clam and you put it in the pH that is not 8.1,
p41
aVwhich is the normal pH of seawater, but 7.5,
p42
aVit dissolves in about three days.
p43
aVIf you take a sea urchin larva from 8.1,
p44
aVput it in a pH of 7.7 \u2014 not a huge change \u2014
p45
aVit becomes deformed and dies.
p46
aVAlready, commercial oyster larvae are dying at large scales in some places.
p47
aVCoral reefs are growing slower in some places because of this problem.
p48
aVSo this really matters.
p49
aa(lp50
VNow, let's take a little tour around the Gulf a little bit.
p51
aVOne of the things that really impresses me about the people in the Gulf:
p52
aVThey are really, really aquatic people.
p53
aVAnd they can handle water.
p54
aVThey can handle a hurricane that comes and goes.
p55
aVWhen the water goes down, they know what to do.
p56
aVBut when it's something other than water, and their water habitat changes,
p57
aVthey don't have many options.
p58
aVIn fact, those entire communities really don't have many options.
p59
aVThey don't have another thing they can do.
p60
aVThey can't go and work in the local hotel business
p61
aVbecause there isn't one in their community.
p62
aa(lp63
VIf you go to the Gulf and you look around, you do see a lot of oil.
p64
aVYou see a lot of oil on the ocean.
p65
aVYou see a lot of oil on the shoreline.
p66
aVIf you go to the site of the blowout, it looks pretty unbelievable.
p67
aVIt looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car,
p68
aVand you just dumped it in the ocean.
p69
aVAnd one of the really most incredible things, I think,
p70
aVis that there's nobody out there trying to collect it
p71
aVat the site where it is densest.
p72
aVParts of the ocean there look just absolutely apocalyptic.
p73
aVYou go in along the shore, you can find it everywhere.
p74
aVIt's really messy.
p75
aVIf you go to the places where it's just arriving,
p76
aVlike the eastern part of the Gulf, in Alabama,
p77
aVthere's still people using the beach
p78
aVwhile there are people cleaning up the beach.
p79
aVAnd they have a very strange way of cleaning up the beach.
p80
aVThey're not allowed to put more than 10 pounds of sand
p81
aVin a 50-gallon plastic bag.
p82
aVThey have thousands and thousands of plastic bags.
p83
aVI don't know what they'll do with all that stuff.
p84
aVMeanwhile, there are still people trying to use the beach.
p85
aVThey don't see the sign that says: "Stay out of the water."
p86
aVTheir kids are in the water;
p87
aVthey're getting tar all over their clothes and their sandals\u2014
p88
aVIt's a mess.
p89
aVIf you go to where the oil has been for a while, it's an even bigger mess.
p90
aVAnd there's basically nobody there anymore,
p91
aVa few people trying to keep using it.
p92
aa(lp93
VYou see people who are really shell-shocked.
p94
aVThey are very hardworking people.
p95
aVAll they know about life is they get up in the morning,
p96
aVand if their engine starts, they go to work.
p97
aVThey always felt that they could rely on the assurances
p98
aVthat nature brought them through the ecosystem of the Gulf.
p99
aVThey're finding that their world is really collapsing.
p100
aVAnd so you can see, literally, signs of their shock ...
p101
aVsigns of their outrage ...
p102
aVsigns of their anger ...
p103
aVand signs of their grief.
p104
aVThese are the things that you can see.
p105
aa(lp106
VThere's a lot you can't see, also, underwater.
p107
aVWhat's going on underwater?
p108
aVWell, some people say there are oil plumes.
p109
aVSome people say there are not oil plumes.
p110
aVAnd Congressman Markey asks, you know,
p111
aV"Is it going to take a submarine ride to see if there are really oil plumes?"
p112
aVBut I couldn't take a submarine ride \u2014
p113
aVespecially between the time I knew I was coming here and today \u2014
p114
aVso I had to do a little experiment myself
p115
aVto see if there was oil in the Gulf of Mexico.
p116
aVSo this is the Gulf of Mexico ...
p117
aVsparkling place full of fish.
p118
aVAnd I created a little oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
p119
aVAnd I learned, in fact, I confirmed the hypothesis
p120
aVthat oil and water don't mix ...
p121
aVuntil you add a dispersant ...
p122
aVand then ...
p123
aVthey start mixing.
p124
aVAnd you add a little energy from the wind and the waves,
p125
aVand you get a big mess,
p126
aVa big mess that you can't possibly clean,
p127
aVyou can't touch, you can't extract
p128
aVand, I think most importantly \u2014 this is what I think \u2014
p129
aVyou can't see it.
p130
aVI think it's being hidden on purpose.
p131
aVNow this is such a catastrophe and such a mess
p132
aVthat lots of stuff is leaking out on the edges of the information stream.
p133
aVBut as many people have said,
p134
aVthere's a large attempt to suppress what's going on.
p135
aVPersonally, I think that the dispersants are a major strategy to hide the body,
p136
aVbecause we put the murderer in charge of the crime scene.
p137
aVBut you can see it.
p138
aVYou can see where the oil is concentrated at the surface,
p139
aVand then it is attacked,
p140
aVbecause they don't want the evidence, in my opinion.
p141
aa(lp142
VOK.
p143
aVWe heard that bacteria eat oil?
p144
aVSo do sea turtles.
p145
aVWhen it breaks up,
p146
aVit has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria.
p147
aVTurtles eat it. It gets in the gills of fish.
p148
aVThese guys have to swim around through it.
p149
aVI heard the most incredible story today when I was on the train coming here.
p150
aVA writer named Ted Williams called me,
p151
aVand he was asking me a couple of questions about what I saw,
p152
aVbecause he's writing an article for Audubon magazine.
p153
aVHe said that he had been in the Gulf a little while ago; like about a week ago,
p154
aVand a guy who had been a recreational fishing guide
p155
aVtook him out to show him what's going on.
p156
aVThat guide's entire calendar year is canceled bookings.
p157
aVHe has no bookings left.
p158
aVEverybody wanted their deposit back, everybody is fleeing.
p159
aVThat's the story of thousands of people.
p160
aVBut he told Ted that on the last day he went out,
p161
aVa bottlenose dolphin suddenly appeared next to the boat,
p162
aVand it was splattering oil out its blowhole.
p163
aVAnd he moved away because it was his last fishing trip,
p164
aVand he knew that the dolphins scare fish.
p165
aVSo he moved away from it, turned around a few minutes later,
p166
aVit was right next to the side of the boat again.
p167
aVHe said that in 30 years of fishing he had never seen a dolphin do that.
p168
aVAnd he felt that \u2014
p169
aa(lp170
V(Sigh)
p171
aa(lp172
Vhe felt that it was coming to ask for help.
p173
aVSorry.
p174
aa(lp175
VNow, in the Exxon Valdez spill,
p176
aVabout 30 percent of the killer whales died in the first few months.
p177
aVTheir numbers have never recovered.
p178
aVSo the recovery rate of all this stuff is going to be variable.
p179
aVIt's going to take longer for some things.
p180
aVAnd some things, I think, will probably come back a little faster.
p181
aVThe other thing about the Gulf that is important
p182
aVis that there are a lot of animals that concentrate in the Gulf
p183
aVat certain parts of the year.
p184
aVSo the Gulf is a really important piece of water \u2014
p185
aVmore important than a similar volume of water in the open Atlantic Ocean.
p186
aVThese tuna swim the entire ocean.
p187
aVThey get in the Gulf Stream, they go all the way to Europe.
p188
aVWhen it comes time to spawn, they come inside,
p189
aVand these two tuna that were tagged,
p190
aVyou can see them on the spawning grounds
p191
aVvery much right in the area of the slick.
p192
aVThey're probably having, at the very least,
p193
aVa catastrophic spawning season this year.
p194
aVI'm hoping that maybe the adults are avoiding that dirty water.
p195
aVThey don't usually like to go into water that is very cloudy anyway.
p196
aVBut these are really high-performance athletic animals.
p197
aVI don't know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills.
p198
aVI don't know if it'll affect the adults.
p199
aVIf it's not, it's certainly affecting their eggs and larvae,
p200
aVI would certainly think.
p201
aVBut if you look at that graph that goes down and down and down,
p202
aVthat's what we've done to this species through overfishing over many decades.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo while the oil spill, the leak, the eruption, is a catastrophe,
p205
aVI think it's important to keep in mind
p206
aVthat we've done a lot to affect what's in the ocean, for a very long time.
p207
aVIt's not like we're starting with something that's been OK.
p208
aVWe're starting with something that's had a lot of stresses
p209
aVand a lot of problems to begin with.
p210
aVIf you look around at the birds, there are a lot of birds in the Gulf
p211
aVthat concentrate in the Gulf at certain times of the year,
p212
aVbut then leave.
p213
aVAnd they populate much larger areas.
p214
aVFor instance, most of the birds in this picture are migratory birds.
p215
aVThey were all on the Gulf in May,
p216
aVwhile oil was starting to come ashore in certain places.
p217
aVDown on the lower left there are ruddy turnstones and sanderlings.
p218
aVThey breed in the High Arctic,
p219
aVand they winter down in southern South America.
p220
aVBut they concentrate in the Gulf and then fan out all across the Arctic.
p221
aVI saw birds that breed in Greenland, in the Gulf.
p222
aVSo this is a hemispheric issue.
p223
aVThe economic effects go at least nationally in many ways.
p224
aVThe biological effects are certainly hemispheric.
p225
aa(lp226
VI think that this is one of the most absolutely mind-boggling examples
p227
aVof total unpreparedness that I can even think of.
p228
aVEven when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor,
p229
aVat least they shot back.
p230
aVAnd we just seem to be unable to figure out what to do.
p231
aVThere was nothing ready,
p232
aVand, you know, as we can see by what they're doing.
p233
aVMainly what they're doing is booms and dispersants.
p234
aVThe booms are absolutely not made for open water.
p235
aVThey don't even attempt to corral the oil where it is most concentrated.
p236
aVThey get near shore \u2014 Look at these two boats.
p237
aVThat one on the right is called Fishing Fool.
p238
aVAnd I think, you know, that's a great name
p239
aVfor boats that think that they're going to do anything
p240
aVto make a dent in this, by dragging a boom between them
p241
aVwhen there are literally hundreds of thousands of square miles
p242
aVin the Gulf right now with oil at the surface.
p243
aa(lp244
VThe dispersants make the oil go right under the booms.
p245
aVThe booms are only about 13 inches in diameter.
p246
aVSo it's just absolutely crazy.
p247
aVHere are shrimp boats employed.
p248
aVThere are hundreds of shrimp boats employed to drag booms instead of nets.
p249
aVHere they are working.
p250
aVYou can see easily
p251
aVthat all the oily water just goes over the back of the boom.
p252
aVAll they're doing is stirring it.
p253
aVIt's just ridiculous.
p254
aVAlso, for all the shoreline that has booms \u2014
p255
aVhundreds and hundreds of miles of shoreline \u2014
p256
aVall of the shoreline that has booms,
p257
aVthere's adjacent shoreline that doesn't have any booms.
p258
aVThere is ample opportunity for oil and dirty water to get in behind them.
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd that lower photo, that's a bird colony that has been boomed.
p261
aVEverybody's trying to protect the bird colonies there.
p262
aVWell, as an ornithologist, I can tell you that birds fly, and that \u2014
p263
aa(lp264
V(Laughter)
p265
aa(lp266
Vand that booming a bird colony doesn't do it; it doesn't do it.
p267
aVThese birds make a living by diving into the water.
p268
aVIn fact ...
p269
aVreally what I think they should do, if anything \u2014
p270
aVthey're trying so hard to protect those nests \u2014
p271
aVactually, if they destroyed every single nest,
p272
aVsome of the birds would leave,
p273
aVand that would be better for them this year.
p274
aVAs far as cleaning them ...
p275
aVI don't mean to cast any aspersion on people cleaning birds.
p276
aVIt's really, really important that we express our compassion.
p277
aVI think that's the most important thing that people have, is compassion.
p278
aVIt's really important to get those images and to show it.
p279
aVBut really, where are those birds going to get released to?
p280
aVIt's like taking somebody out of a burning building,
p281
aVtreating them for smoke inhalation
p282
aVand sending them back into the building, because the oil is still gushing.
p283
aa(lp284
VI refuse to acknowledge this as anything like an accident.
p285
aVI think that this is the result of gross negligence.
p286
aa(lp287
V(Applause)
p288
aa(lp289
VNot just BP.
p290
aVBP operated very sloppily and very recklessly because they could.
p291
aVAnd they were allowed to do so
p292
aVbecause of the absolute failure of oversight of the government
p293
aVthat is supposed to be our government, protecting us.
p294
aVIt turns out that \u2014
p295
aVyou see this sign on every commercial vessel in the United States \u2014
p296
aVyou know, if you spilled a couple of gallons of oil,
p297
aVyou would be in big trouble.
p298
aVAnd you have to really wonder who are the laws made for,
p299
aVand who has gotten above the laws.
p300
aVAnd there are things that we can do in the future.
p301
aVWe could have the kinds of equipment that we would really need.
p302
aVIt would not take an awful lot to anticipate
p303
aVthat after making 30,000 holes
p304
aVin the sea floor of the Gulf of Mexico looking for oil,
p305
aVoil might start coming out of one of them.
p306
aVAnd you'd have some idea of what to do.
p307
aVThat's certainly one of the things we need to do.
p308
aa(lp309
VBut I think we have to understand where this leak really started from.
p310
aVIt really started from the destruction of the idea that the government is there
p311
aVbecause it's our government,
p312
aVmeant to protect the larger public interest.
p313
aVSo I think that the oil blowout, the bank bailout,
p314
aVthe mortgage crisis and all these things are absolutely symptoms of the same cause.
p315
aVWe still seem to understand that at least,
p316
aVwe need the police to protect us from a few bad people.
p317
aVAnd even though the police can be a little annoying at times \u2014
p318
aVgiving us tickets and stuff like that \u2014
p319
aVnobody says that we should just get rid of them.
p320
aVBut in the entire rest of government right now
p321
aVand for the last at least 30 years,
p322
aVthere has been a culture of deregulation
p323
aVthat is caused directly by the people who we need to be protected from,
p324
aVbuying the government out from under us.
p325
aa(lp326
V(Applause)
p327
aa(lp328
VNow this has been a problem for a very, very long time.
p329
aVYou can see that corporations were illegal at the founding of America,
p330
aVand even Thomas Jefferson complained
p331
aVthat they were already bidding defiance to the laws of our country.
p332
aVOK, people who say they're conservative,
p333
aVif they really wanted to be really conservative and patriotic,
p334
aVthey would tell these corporations to go to hell.
p335
aVThat's what it would really mean to be conservative.
p336
aVSo what we really need to do is regain the idea
p337
aVthat it's our government safeguarding our interests,
p338
aVand regain a sense of unity and common cause in our country
p339
aVthat really has been lost.
p340
aVI think there are signs of hope.
p341
aa(lp342
VWe seem to be waking up a little bit.
p343
aVThe Glass-Steagall Act \u2014 which was really to protect us
p344
aVfrom the kind of thing that caused the recession to happen,
p345
aVand the bank meltdown and all that stuff that required the bailouts \u2014
p346
aVthat was put in effect in 1933, was systematically destroyed.
p347
aVNow there's a mood to put some of that stuff back in place,
p348
aVbut the lobbyists are already there trying to weaken the regulations
p349
aVafter the legislation has just passed.
p350
aVSo it's a continued fight.
p351
aVIt's a historic moment right now.
p352
aVWe're either going to have an absolutely unmitigated catastrophe
p353
aVof this oil leak in the Gulf,
p354
aVor we will make the moment we need out of this,
p355
aVas many people have noted today.
p356
aVThere's certainly a common theme
p357
aVabout needing to make the moment out of this.
p358
aa(lp359
VWe've been through this before with other ways of offshore drilling.
p360
aVThe first offshore wells were called whales.
p361
aVThe first offshore drills were called harpoons.
p362
aVWe emptied the ocean of the whales at that time.
p363
aVNow are we stuck with this?
p364
aVEver since we lived in caves, every time we wanted any energy,
p365
aVwe lit something on fire, and that is still what we're doing.
p366
aVWe're still lighting something on fire every time we want energy.
p367
aa(lp368
VAnd people say we can't have clean energy
p369
aVbecause it's too expensive.
p370
aVWho says it's too expensive?
p371
aVPeople who sell us fossil fuels.
p372
aVWe've been here before with energy,
p373
aVand people saying the economy cannot withstand a switch,
p374
aVbecause the cheapest energy was slavery.
p375
aVEnergy is always a moral issue.
p376
aVIt's an issue that is moral right now.
p377
aVIt's a matter of right and wrong.
