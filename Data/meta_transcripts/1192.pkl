VI love the Internet.
p4
aVIt's true.
p5
aVThink about everything it has brought us.
p6
aVThink about all the services we use,
p7
aVall the connectivity,
p8
aVall the entertainment,
p9
aVall the business, all the commerce.
p10
aVAnd it's happening during our lifetimes.
p11
aVI'm pretty sure that one day
p12
aVwe'll be writing history books
p13
aVhundreds of years from now. This time
p14
aVour generation will be remembered
p15
aVas the generation that got online,
p16
aVthe generation
p17
aVthat built something really and truly global.
p18
aVBut yes, it's also true
p19
aVthat the Internet has problems, very serious problems,
p20
aVproblems with security
p21
aVand problems with privacy.
p22
aVI've spent my career
p23
aVfighting these problems.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo let me show you something.
p26
aVThis here
p27
aVis Brain.
p28
aVThis is a floppy disk
p29
aV\u2014 five and a quarter-inch floppy disk
p30
aVinfected by Brain.A.
p31
aVIt's the first virus we ever found
p32
aVfor PC computers.
p33
aVAnd we actually know
p34
aVwhere Brain came from.
p35
aVWe know because it says so
p36
aVinside the code.
p37
aVLet's take a look.
p38
aVAll right.
p39
aVThat's the boot sector of an infected floppy,
p40
aVand if we take a closer look inside,
p41
aVwe'll see that right there,
p42
aVit says, "Welcome to the dungeon."
p43
aVAnd then it continues,
p44
aVsaying, 1986, Basit and Amjad.
p45
aVAnd Basit and Amjad are first names,
p46
aVPakistani first names.
p47
aVIn fact, there's a phone number and an address in Pakistan.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VNow, 1986.
p52
aVNow it's 2011.
p53
aVThat's 25 years ago.
p54
aVThe PC virus problem is 25 years old now.
p55
aVSo half a year ago,
p56
aVI decided to go to Pakistan myself.
p57
aVSo let's see, here's a couple of photos I took while I was in Pakistan.
p58
aVThis is from the city of Lahore,
p59
aVwhich is around 300 kilometers south
p60
aVfrom Abbottabad, where Bin Laden was caught.
p61
aVHere's a typical street view.
p62
aVAnd here's the street or road leading to this building,
p63
aVwhich is 730 Nizam block at Allama Iqbal Town.
p64
aVAnd I knocked on the door.
p65
aV(Laughter)
p66
aVYou want to guess who opened the door?
p67
aVBasit and Amjad; they are still there.
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aV(Applause)
p70
aVSo here standing up is Basit.
p71
aVSitting down is his brother Amjad.
p72
aVThese are the guys who wrote the first PC virus.
p73
aVNow of course, we had a very interesting discussion.
p74
aVI asked them why.
p75
aVI asked them how they feel about what they started.
p76
aVAnd I got some sort of satisfaction
p77
aVfrom learning that both Basit and Amjad
p78
aVhad had their computers infected dozens of times
p79
aVby completely unrelated other viruses
p80
aVover these years.
p81
aVSo there is some sort of justice
p82
aVin the world after all.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow, the viruses that we used to see
p85
aVin the 1980s and 1990s
p86
aVobviously are not a problem any more.
p87
aVSo let me just show you a couple of examples
p88
aVof what they used to look like.
p89
aVWhat I'm running here
p90
aVis a system that enables me
p91
aVto run age-old programs on a modern computer.
p92
aVSo let me just mount some drives. Go over there.
p93
aVWhat we have here is a list of old viruses.
p94
aVSo let me just run some viruses on my computer.
p95
aa(lp96
VFor example,
p97
aVlet's go with the Centipede virus first.
p98
aVAnd you can see at the top of the screen,
p99
aVthere's a centipede scrolling across your computer
p100
aVwhen you get infected by this one.
p101
aVYou know that you're infected
p102
aVbecause it actually shows up.
p103
aVHere's another one. This is the virus called Crash,
p104
aVinvented in Russia in 1992.
p105
aVLet me show you one which actually makes some sound.
p106
aV(Siren noise)
p107
aVAnd the last example,
p108
aVguess what the Walker virus does?
p109
aVYes, there's a guy walking across your screen
p110
aVonce you get infected.
p111
aVSo it used to be fairly easy to know
p112
aVthat you're infected by a virus,
p113
aVwhen the viruses were written by hobbyists
p114
aVand teenagers.
p115
aa(lp116
VToday, they are no longer being written
p117
aVby hobbyists and teenagers.
p118
aVToday, viruses are a global problem.
p119
aVWhat we have here in the background
p120
aVis an example of our systems that we run in our labs,
p121
aVwhere we track virus infections worldwide.
p122
aVSo we can actually see in real time
p123
aVthat we've just blocked viruses in Sweden and Taiwan
p124
aVand Russia and elsewhere.
p125
aVIn fact, if I just connect back to our lab systems
p126
aVthrough the Web,
p127
aVwe can see in real time
p128
aVjust some kind of idea of how many viruses,
p129
aVhow many new examples of malware we find every single day.
p130
aVHere's the latest virus we've found,
p131
aVin a file called Server.exe.
p132
aVAnd we found it right over here three seconds ago \u2014
p133
aVthe previous one, six seconds ago.
p134
aVAnd if we just scroll around,
p135
aVit's just massive.
p136
aVWe find tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands.
p137
aVAnd that's the last 20 minutes of malware
p138
aVevery single day.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo where are all these coming from then?
p141
aVWell today, it's the organized criminal gangs
p142
aVwriting these viruses
p143
aVbecause they make money with their viruses.
p144
aVIt's gangs like \u2014
p145
aVlet's go to GangstaBucks.com.
p146
aVThis is a website operating in Moscow
p147
aVwhere these guys are buying infected computers.
p148
aVSo if you are a virus writer
p149
aVand you're capable of infecting Windows computers,
p150
aVbut you don't know what to do with them,
p151
aVyou can sell those infected computers \u2014
p152
aVsomebody else's computers \u2014 to these guys.
p153
aVAnd they'll actually pay you money for those computers.
p154
aVSo how do these guys then monetize
p155
aVthose infected computers?
p156
aVWell there's multiple different ways,
p157
aVsuch as banking trojans, which will steal money from your online banking accounts
p158
aVwhen you do online banking,
p159
aVor keyloggers.
p160
aVKeyloggers silently sit on your computer, hidden from view,
p161
aVand they record everything you type.
p162
aVSo you're sitting on your computer and you're doing Google searches.
p163
aVEvery single Google search you type
p164
aVis saved and sent to the criminals.
p165
aVEvery single email you write is saved and sent to the criminals.
p166
aVSame thing with every single password and so on.
p167
aa(lp168
VBut the thing that they're actually looking for most
p169
aVare sessions where you go online
p170
aVand do online purchases in any online store.
p171
aVBecause when you do purchases in online stores,
p172
aVyou will be typing in your name, the delivery address,
p173
aVyour credit card number and the credit card security codes.
p174
aVAnd here's an example of a file
p175
aVwe found from a server a couple of weeks ago.
p176
aVThat's the credit card number,
p177
aVthat's the expiration date, that's the security code,
p178
aVand that's the name of the owner of the card.
p179
aVOnce you gain access to other people's credit card information,
p180
aVyou can just go online and buy whatever you want
p181
aVwith this information.
p182
aVAnd that, obviously, is a problem.
p183
aVWe now have a whole underground marketplace
p184
aVand business ecosystem
p185
aVbuilt around online crime.
p186
aa(lp187
VOne example of how these guys
p188
aVactually are capable of monetizing their operations:
p189
aVwe go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL
p190
aVand search for wanted persons.
p191
aVWe find guys like Bjorn Sundin, originally from Sweden,
p192
aVand his partner in crime,
p193
aValso listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages,
p194
aVMr. Shaileshkumar Jain,
p195
aVa U.S. citizen.
p196
aVThese guys were running an operation called I.M.U.,
p197
aVa cybercrime operation through which they netted millions.
p198
aVThey are both right now on the run.
p199
aVNobody knows where they are.
p200
aVU.S. officials, just a couple of weeks ago,
p201
aVfroze a Swiss bank account
p202
aVbelonging to Mr. Jain,
p203
aVand that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo the amount of money online crime generates
p206
aVis significant.
p207
aVAnd that means that the online criminals
p208
aVcan actually afford to invest into their attacks.
p209
aVWe know that online criminals
p210
aVare hiring programmers, hiring testing people,
p211
aVtesting their code,
p212
aVhaving back-end systems with SQL databases.
p213
aVAnd they can afford to watch how we work \u2014
p214
aVlike how security people work \u2014
p215
aVand try to work their way around
p216
aVany security precautions we can build.
p217
aVThey also use the global nature of Internet
p218
aVto their advantage.
p219
aVI mean, the Internet is international.
p220
aVThat's why we call it the Internet.
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd if you just go and take a look
p223
aVat what's happening in the online world,
p224
aVhere's a video built by Clarified Networks,
p225
aVwhich illustrates how one single malware family is able to move around the world.
p226
aVThis operation, believed to be originally from Estonia,
p227
aVmoves around from one country to another
p228
aVas soon as the website is tried to shut down.
p229
aVSo you just can't shut these guys down.
p230
aVThey will switch from one country to another,
p231
aVfrom one jurisdiction to another \u2014
p232
aVmoving around the world,
p233
aVusing the fact that we don't have the capability
p234
aVto globally police operations like this.
p235
aVSo the Internet is as if
p236
aVsomeone would have given free plane tickets
p237
aVto all the online criminals of the world.
p238
aVNow, criminals who weren't capable of reaching us before
p239
aVcan reach us.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo how do you actually go around finding online criminals?
p242
aVHow do you actually track them down?
p243
aVLet me give you an example.
p244
aVWhat we have here is one exploit file.
p245
aVHere, I'm looking at the Hex dump of an image file,
p246
aVwhich contains an exploit.
p247
aVAnd that basically means, if you're trying to view this image file on your Windows computer,
p248
aVit actually takes over your computer and runs code.
p249
aa(lp250
VNow, if you'll take a look at this image file \u2014
p251
aVwell there's the image header,
p252
aVand there the actual code of the attack starts.
p253
aVAnd that code has been encrypted,
p254
aVso let's decrypt it.
p255
aVIt has been encrypted with XOR function 97.
p256
aVYou just have to believe me,
p257
aVit is, it is.
p258
aVAnd we can go here
p259
aVand actually start decrypting it.
p260
aVWell the yellow part of the code is now decrypted.
p261
aVAnd I know, it doesn't really look much different from the original.
p262
aVBut just keep staring at it.
p263
aVYou'll actually see that down here
p264
aVyou can see a Web address:
p265
aVunionseek.com/d/ioo.exe
p266
aVAnd when you view this image on your computer
p267
aVit actually is going to download and run that program.
p268
aVAnd that's a backdoor which will take over your computer.
p269
aa(lp270
VBut even more interestingly,
p271
aVif we continue decrypting,
p272
aVwe'll find this mysterious string,
p273
aVwhich says O600KO78RUS.
p274
aVThat code is there underneath the encryption
p275
aVas some sort of a signature.
p276
aVIt's not used for anything.
p277
aVAnd I was looking at that, trying to figure out what it means.
p278
aVSo obviously I Googled for it.
p279
aVI got zero hits; wasn't there.
p280
aVSo I spoke with the guys at the lab.
p281
aVAnd we have a couple of Russian guys in our labs,
p282
aVand one of them mentioned,
p283
aVwell, it ends in RUS like Russia.
p284
aVAnd 78 is the city code
p285
aVfor the city of St. Petersburg.
p286
aVFor example, you can find it from some phone numbers
p287
aVand car license plates and stuff like that.
p288
aVSo I went looking for contacts in St. Petersburg,
p289
aVand through a long road,
p290
aVwe eventually found this one particular website.
p291
aa(lp292
VHere's this Russian guy who's been operating online for a number of years
p293
aVwho runs his own website,
p294
aVand he runs a blog under the popular Live Journal.
p295
aVAnd on this blog, he blogs about his life,
p296
aVabout his life in St. Petersburg \u2014
p297
aVhe's in his early 20s \u2014
p298
aVabout his cat,
p299
aVabout his girlfriend.
p300
aVAnd he drives a very nice car.
p301
aVIn fact, this guy drives
p302
aVa Mercedes-Benz S600
p303
aVV12
p304
aVwith a six-liter engine
p305
aVwith more than 400 horsepower.
p306
aVNow that's a nice car for a 20-something year-old kid in St. Petersburg.
p307
aa(lp308
VHow do I know about this car?
p309
aVBecause he blogged about the car.
p310
aVHe actually had a car accident.
p311
aVIn downtown St. Petersburg,
p312
aVhe actually crashed his car into another car.
p313
aVAnd he put blogged images about the car accident \u2014
p314
aVthat's his Mercedes \u2014
p315
aVright here is the Lada Samara he crashed into.
p316
aVAnd you can actually see that the license plate of the Samara
p317
aVends in 78RUS.
p318
aVAnd if you actually take a look at the scene picture,
p319
aVyou can see that the plate of the Mercedes
p320
aVis O600KO78RUS.
p321
aVNow I'm not a lawyer,
p322
aVbut if I would be,
p323
aVthis is where I would say, "I rest my case."
p324
aa(lp325
V(Laughter)
p326
aa(lp327
VSo what happens when online criminals are caught?
p328
aVWell in most cases it never gets this far.
p329
aVThe vast majority of the online crime cases,
p330
aVwe don't even know which continent the attacks are coming from.
p331
aVAnd even if we are able to find online criminals,
p332
aVquite often there is no outcome.
p333
aVThe local police don't act, or if they do, there's not enough evidence,
p334
aVor for some reason we can't take them down.
p335
aVI wish it would be easier;
p336
aVunfortunately it isn't.
p337
aa(lp338
VBut things are also changing
p339
aVat a very rapid pace.
p340
aVYou've all heard about things like Stuxnet.
p341
aVSo if you look at what Stuxnet did
p342
aVis that it infected these.
p343
aVThat's a Siemens S7-400 PLC,
p344
aVprogrammable logic [controller].
p345
aVAnd this is what runs our infrastructure.
p346
aVThis is what runs everything around us.
p347
aVPLC's, these small boxes which have no display,
p348
aVno keyboard,
p349
aVwhich are programmed, are put in place, and they do their job.
p350
aVFor example, the elevators in this building
p351
aVmost likely are controlled by one of these.
p352
aVAnd when Stuxnet infects one of these,
p353
aVthat's a massive revolution
p354
aVon the kinds of risks we have to worry about.
p355
aVBecause everything around us is being run by these.
p356
aVI mean, we have critical infrastructure.
p357
aVYou go to any factory, any power plant,
p358
aVany chemical plant, any food processing plant,
p359
aVyou look around \u2014
p360
aVeverything is being run by computers.
p361
aa(lp362
VEverything is being run by computers.
p363
aVEverything is reliant on these computers working.
p364
aVWe have become very reliant
p365
aVon Internet,
p366
aVon basic things like electricity, obviously,
p367
aVon computers working.
p368
aVAnd this really is something
p369
aVwhich creates completely new problems for us.
p370
aVWe must have some way
p371
aVof continuing to work
p372
aVeven if computers fail.
p373
aa(lp374
V(Laughter)
p375
aa(lp376
V(Applause)
p377
aa(lp378
VSo preparedness means that we can do stuff
p379
aVeven when the things we take for granted
p380
aVaren't there.
p381
aVIt's actually very basic stuff \u2014
p382
aVthinking about continuity, thinking about backups,
p383
aVthinking about the things that actually matter.
p384
aa(lp385
VNow I told you \u2014
p386
aV(Laughter)
p387
aVI love the Internet. I do.
p388
aVThink about all the services we have online.
p389
aVThink about if they are taken away from you,
p390
aVif one day you don't actually have them
p391
aVfor some reason or another.
p392
aVI see beauty in the future of the Internet,
p393
aVbut I'm worried
p394
aVthat we might not see that.
p395
aVI'm worried that we are running into problems
p396
aVbecause of online crime.
p397
aVOnline crime is the one thing
p398
aVthat might take these things away from us.
p399
aa(lp400
V(Laughter)
p401
aa(lp402
VI've spent my life
p403
aVdefending the Net,
p404
aVand I do feel that if we don't fight online crime,
p405
aVwe are running a risk of losing it all.
p406
aVWe have to do this globally,
p407
aVand we have to do it right now.
p408
aVWhat we need
p409
aVis more global, international law enforcement work
p410
aVto find online criminal gangs \u2014
p411
aVthese organized gangs
p412
aVthat are making millions out of their attacks.
p413
aVThat's much more important
p414
aVthan running anti-viruses or running firewalls.
p415
aVWhat actually matters
p416
aVis actually finding the people behind these attacks,
p417
aVand even more importantly,
p418
aVwe have to find the people
p419
aVwho are about to become
p420
aVpart of this online world of crime,
p421
aVbut haven't yet done it.
p422
aVWe have to find the people with the skills,
p423
aVbut without the opportunities
p424
aVand give them the opportunities
p425
aVto use their skills for good.
p426
aa(lp427
