VWhenever I get to travel for work,
p4
aVI try to find out where my drinking water comes from,
p5
aVand where my poop and pee go.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VThis has earned me the nickname "The Poo Princess" in my family,
p10
aVand it's ruined many family vacations, because this is not normal.
p11
aVBut thinking about where it all goes is the first step in activating
p12
aVwhat are actually superpowers in our poop and pee.
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VYeah.
p17
aVAnd if we use them well,
p18
aVwe can live healthier and more beautifully.
p19
aa(lp20
VCheck out this landscape in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
p21
aVJust notice what kinds of words and feelings come to mind.
p22
aVThis landscape was watered with treated sewage water.
p23
aVDoes that change anything for you?
p24
aVI imagine it might.
p25
aVAnd that's OK.
p26
aVHow we feel about this
p27
aVis going to determine exactly how innovative we can be.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd I want to explain how it works,
p30
aVbut what words do I use?
p31
aVI mean, I can use profane words like "shit" and "piss,"
p32
aVand then my grandma won't watch the video.
p33
aVOr I can use childish words like "poo" and "pee." Eh.
p34
aVOr I can use scientific words like "excrement" and "feces." Humph.
p35
aVI'll use a mix.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VIt's all I got. (Laughs)
p40
aa(lp41
VSo, in this suburb,
p42
aVthe poo and the pee and the wash water are going to this treatment plant
p43
aVright in the middle of the community.
p44
aVIt looks more like a park than a treatment plant.
p45
aVThe poo at the very bottom of all those layers of gravel \u2014
p46
aVnot touching anyone \u2014
p47
aVis providing solid food for those marsh plants.
p48
aVAnd the clean, clear water that comes out the other end
p49
aVis traveling underground to water each person's yard.
p50
aVSo even though they're in a desert,
p51
aVthey get their own personal oasis.
p52
aa(lp53
VThis approach is called Integrated Water Management,
p54
aVor holistic or closed-loop.
p55
aVWhatever you want to call it,
p56
aVit's in conflict with the status quo of how we think about sanitation,
p57
aVwhich is contain, treat, push it away.
p58
aVBut in this approach, we're doing one step better.
p59
aVWe're designing for reuse from the very beginning,
p60
aVbecause everything does get reused,
p61
aVonly now we're planning for it.
p62
aVAnd often, that makes for really beautiful spaces.
p63
aVBut the most important thing about this system
p64
aVisn't the technicals of how it works.
p65
aVIt's how you feel about it.
p66
aVDo you want this in your yard?
p67
aVWhy not?
p68
aa(lp69
VI got really curious about this question.
p70
aVWhy don't we see more innovation in sanitation?
p71
aVWhy isn't that kind of thing the new normal?
p72
aVAnd I care so much about this question,
p73
aVthat I work for a nonprofit called Recode.
p74
aVWe want to accelerate adoption
p75
aVof sustainable building and development practices.
p76
aVWe want more innovation.
p77
aVBut a lot of times, whole categories of innovation \u2014
p78
aVones that can help us live more beautifully \u2014
p79
aVturn out to be illegal.
p80
aVToday's regulations and codes were written under the assumption
p81
aVthat best practices would remain best practices,
p82
aVwith incremental updates forever and ever.
p83
aVBut innovation isn't always incremental.
p84
aVIt turns out, how we feel about any particular new technique
p85
aVgets into everything we do:
p86
aVhow we talk about it,
p87
aVhow we encourage people to study,
p88
aVour jokes, our codes ...
p89
aVAnd it ultimately determines how innovative we can be.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo, that's the first reason we don't innovate in sanitation.
p92
aVWe're kind of uncomfortable talking about sanitation,
p93
aVthat's why I've gotten called "The Poo Princess" so much.
p94
aVThe second reason is:
p95
aVwe think the problem is solved here in the US.
p96
aVBut not so.
p97
aVHere in the US we still get sick from drinking shit in our sewage water.
p98
aVSeven million people get sick every year,
p99
aV900 die annually.
p100
aVAnd we're not taking a holistic approach to making it better.
p101
aVSo we're not solving it.
p102
aa(lp103
VWhere I live in Portland, Oregon,
p104
aVI can't take Echo for a swim during the rainy season,
p105
aVbecause we dump raw sewage sometimes into our river.
p106
aVOur rainwater and our sewage go to the same treatment plant.
p107
aVToo much rain overflows into the river.
p108
aVAnd Portland is not alone here.
p109
aVForty percent of municipalities self-report
p110
aVdumping raw or partially treated sewage into our waterways.
p111
aa(lp112
VThe other bummer going on here with our status quo
p113
aVis that half of all of your poop and pee is going to fertilize farmland.
p114
aVThe other half is being incinerated
p115
aVor land-filled.
p116
aVAnd that's a bummer to me,
p117
aVbecause there are amazing nutrients in your daily doody.
p118
aVIt is comparable to pig manure;
p119
aVwe're omnivores, they're omnivores.
p120
aVThink of your poo and pee as a health smoothie for a tree.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VThe other bummer going on here
p125
aVis that we're quickly moving all the drugs we take into our waterways.
p126
aVThe average wastewater treatment plant can remove maybe half of the drugs
p127
aVthat come in.
p128
aVThe other half goes right out the other side.
p129
aVConsider what a cocktail of pharmaceuticals \u2014
p130
aVhormones, steroids, Vicodin \u2014
p131
aVdoes to a fish,
p132
aVto a dog,
p133
aVto a child.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut this isn't just some problem that we need to contain.
p136
aVIf we flip this around, we can create a resource
p137
aVthat can solve so many of our other problems.
p138
aVAnd I want to get you comfortable with this idea,
p139
aVso imagine the things I'm going to show you, these technologies,
p140
aVand this attitude that says,
p141
aV"We're going to reuse this.
p142
aVLet's design to make it beautiful" \u2014
p143
aVas advanced potty training.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VI think you're ready for it.
p148
aVI think we as a culture are ready for advanced potty training.
p149
aVAnd there are three great reasons to enroll today.
p150
aVNumber one:
p151
aVwe can fertilize our food.
p152
aVEach one of us is pooping and peeing something
p153
aVthat could fertilize half or maybe all of our food,
p154
aVdepending on our diet.
p155
aVThat dark brown poo in the toilet is dark brown because of what?
p156
aVDead stuff, bacteria.
p157
aVThat's carbon.
p158
aVAnd carbon, if we're getting that into the soil,
p159
aVis going to bind to the other minerals and nutrients in there.
p160
aVBoom! Healthier food.
p161
aVVoilà! Healthier people.
p162
aVChemical fertilizers by definition don't have carbon in them.
p163
aVImagine if we could move our animal manure and our human manure to our soil,
p164
aVwe might not need to rely on fossil fuel-based fertilizers,
p165
aVmine minerals from far away.
p166
aVImagine how much energy we could save.
p167
aa(lp168
VNow, some of us are concerned
p169
aVabout industrial pollutants contaminating this reuse cycle.
p170
aVThat can be addressed.
p171
aVBut we need to separate our discomfort about talking about poo and pee
p172
aVso we can calmly talk about how we want to reuse it
p173
aVand what things we don't want to reuse.
p174
aVAnd get this:
p175
aVif we change our approach to sanitation,
p176
aVwe can start to slow down climate change.
p177
aVRemember that carbon in the poop?
p178
aVIf we can get that into our soil bank,
p179
aVit's going to start to absorb carbon dioxide that we put into the air.
p180
aVAnd that could help slow down global warming.
p181
aa(lp182
VI want to show you some brave souls
p183
aVwho've had the courage to embrace this advanced potty training approach.
p184
aVSo those folks in New Mexico \u2014
p185
aVwhy did they do it?
p186
aV'Cause they're in a desert? 'Cause they save money? Yeah.
p187
aVBut more importantly, they felt comfortable
p188
aVseeing what was going down the toilet as a resource.
p189
aa(lp190
VHere's an average house in Portland, Oregon.
p191
aVThis house is special because they have a composting toilet
p192
aVturning all their poo and pee, over time, into a soil amendment.
p193
aVTheir wash water, their shower water, is going underground
p194
aVto a series of mulch basins,
p195
aVand then watering that orchard downhill.
p196
aVWhen they went to get this permitted,
p197
aVit wasn't allowed in Oregon.
p198
aVBut it was allowed in five other states nearby.
p199
aVThat was Recode's \u2014 my organization's \u2014 first code-change campaign.
p200
aa(lp201
VHere's a great example where the Integrated Water Management approach
p202
aVwas the cheapest.
p203
aVThis is three high-rise residential buildings in downtown Portland,
p204
aVand they're not flushing to the sewer system.
p205
aVHow?
p206
aVWell, their wash water is getting reused to flush toilets,
p207
aVcool mechanical systems,
p208
aVwater the landscape.
p209
aVAnd then once the building has thoroughly used everything \u2014
p210
aVaka, shat in it \u2014
p211
aVit's treated to highest standard right on-site by plants and bacteria,
p212
aVand then infiltrated into the groundwater right below.
p213
aVAnd all that was cheaper
p214
aVthan updating the surrounding sewer infrastructure.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo that's the last reason we should get really excited
p217
aVabout doing things differently:
p218
aVwe can save a lot of money.
p219
aVThis was the first permit of its kind in Oregon.
p220
aVBrave and open-minded people sat down and felt comfortable saying,
p221
aV"Yeah, that shit makes sense."
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
V"Let's do it."
p226
aa(lp227
V(Applause)
p228
aa(lp229
VYou know?
p230
aa(lp231
VI keep showing examples
p232
aVwhere everyone's reusing everything on-site.
p233
aVWhy?
p234
aVWell, when we look at our aging infrastructure \u2014 and it is old \u2014
p235
aVand we look at the cost of updating it,
p236
aVthree-quarters of that cost is just the pipes snaking through our city.
p237
aVSo as we build anew, as we renovate,
p238
aVit might make more sense to treat and reuse everything on-site.
p239
aa(lp240
VSan Francisco realized that it made sense
p241
aVto invest in rebates for every household
p242
aVto reuse their wash water and their rainwater
p243
aVto water the backyard,
p244
aVbecause the amount of water they would save as a community would be so big.
p245
aVBut why were all these projects so innovative?
p246
aVThe money piece, yeah.
p247
aVBut more importantly,
p248
aVthey felt comfortable with this idea of advanced potty training.
p249
aa(lp250
VImagine if we embraced innovation for sanitation
p251
aVthe way we have for, say, solar power.
p252
aVThink about it \u2014 solar power used to be uncommon and unaffordable.
p253
aVNow it's more a part of our web of power than ever before.
p254
aVAnd it's creating resiliency.
p255
aVWe now have sources of power like the sun
p256
aVthat don't vary with our earthly dramas.
p257
aVWhat's driving all that innovation?
p258
aVIt's us.
p259
aVWe're talking about energy.
p260
aVIt's cool to talk about energy.
p261
aVSome folks are even talking about the problems
p262
aVwith the limited resources where our current energy is coming from.
p263
aVWe encourage our best and brightest to work on this issue \u2014
p264
aVbetter solar panels, better batteries, everything.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo let's talk about where our drinking water is coming from,
p267
aVwhere our poo and pee are actually going.
p268
aVIf we can get over this discomfort with this entire topic,
p269
aVwe could create something that creates our future goldmine.
p270
aVEvery time you flush the toilet,
p271
aVI want you to think,
p272
aV"Where is my poop and pee going?
p273
aVWill they be gainfully employed?"
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
V"Or are they going to be wreaking havoc in some waterway?"
p278
aa(lp279
VIf you don't know, find out.
p280
aVAnd if you don't like the answer,
p281
aVfigure out how you can communicate to those who can drive this change
p282
aVthat you have advanced potty training, that you are ready for reuse.
p283
aVHow all of you feel
p284
aVis going to determine exactly how innovative we can be.
p285
aa(lp286
VThank you so much.
