VMy subject today is learning.
p4
aVAnd in that spirit, I want to spring on you all a pop quiz.
p5
aVReady?
p6
aVWhen does learning begin?
p7
aVNow as you ponder that question,
p8
aVmaybe you're thinking about the first day of preschool
p9
aVor kindergarten,
p10
aVthe first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher.
p11
aVOr maybe you've called to mind the toddler phase
p12
aVwhen children are learning how to walk and talk
p13
aVand use a fork.
p14
aVMaybe you've encountered the Zero-to-Three movement,
p15
aVwhich asserts that the most important years for learning
p16
aVare the earliest ones.
p17
aVAnd so your answer to my question would be:
p18
aVLearning begins at birth.
p19
aa(lp20
VWell today I want to present to you
p21
aVan idea that may be surprising
p22
aVand may even seem implausible,
p23
aVbut which is supported by the latest evidence
p24
aVfrom psychology and biology.
p25
aVAnd that is that some of the most important learning we ever do
p26
aVhappens before we're born,
p27
aVwhile we're still in the womb.
p28
aVNow I'm a science reporter.
p29
aVI write books and magazine articles.
p30
aVAnd I'm also a mother.
p31
aVAnd those two roles came together for me
p32
aVin a book that I wrote called "Origins."
p33
aV"Origins" is a report from the front lines
p34
aVof an exciting new field
p35
aVcalled fetal origins.
p36
aVFetal origins is a scientific discipline
p37
aVthat emerged just about two decades ago,
p38
aVand it's based on the theory
p39
aVthat our health and well-being throughout our lives
p40
aVis crucially affected
p41
aVby the nine months we spend in the womb.
p42
aVNow this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me.
p43
aVI was myself pregnant
p44
aVwhile I was doing the research for the book.
p45
aVAnd one of the most fascinating insights
p46
aVI took from this work
p47
aVis that we're all learning about the world
p48
aVeven before we enter it.
p49
aa(lp50
VWhen we hold our babies for the first time,
p51
aVwe might imagine that they're clean slates,
p52
aVunmarked by life,
p53
aVwhen in fact, they've already been shaped by us
p54
aVand by the particular world we live in.
p55
aVToday I want to share with you some of the amazing things
p56
aVthat scientists are discovering
p57
aVabout what fetuses learn
p58
aVwhile they're still in their mothers' bellies.
p59
aa(lp60
VFirst of all,
p61
aVthey learn the sound of their mothers' voices.
p62
aVBecause sounds from the outside world
p63
aVhave to travel through the mother's abdominal tissue
p64
aVand through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus,
p65
aVthe voices fetuses hear,
p66
aVstarting around the fourth month of gestation,
p67
aVare muted and muffled.
p68
aVOne researcher says
p69
aVthat they probably sound a lot like the the voice of Charlie Brown's teacher
p70
aVin the old "Peanuts" cartoon.
p71
aVBut the pregnant woman's own voice
p72
aVreverberates through her body,
p73
aVreaching the fetus much more readily.
p74
aVAnd because the fetus is with her all the time,
p75
aVit hears her voice a lot.
p76
aVOnce the baby's born, it recognizes her voice
p77
aVand it prefers listening to her voice
p78
aVover anyone else's.
p79
aa(lp80
VHow can we know this?
p81
aVNewborn babies can't do much,
p82
aVbut one thing they're really good at is sucking.
p83
aVResearchers take advantage of this fact
p84
aVby rigging up two rubber nipples,
p85
aVso that if a baby sucks on one,
p86
aVit hears a recording of its mother's voice
p87
aVon a pair of headphones,
p88
aVand if it sucks on the other nipple,
p89
aVit hears a recording of a female stranger's voice.
p90
aVBabies quickly show their preference
p91
aVby choosing the first one.
p92
aVScientists also take advantage of the fact
p93
aVthat babies will slow down their sucking
p94
aVwhen something interests them
p95
aVand resume their fast sucking
p96
aVwhen they get bored.
p97
aVThis is how researchers discovered
p98
aVthat, after women repeatedly read aloud
p99
aVa section of Dr. Seuss' "The Cat in the Hat" while they were pregnant,
p100
aVtheir newborn babies recognized that passage
p101
aVwhen they hear it outside the womb.
p102
aVMy favorite experiment of this kind
p103
aVis the one that showed that the babies
p104
aVof women who watched a certain soap opera
p105
aVevery day during pregnancy
p106
aVrecognized the theme song of that show
p107
aVonce they were born.
p108
aVSo fetuses are even learning
p109
aVabout the particular language that's spoken
p110
aVin the world that they'll be born into.
p111
aa(lp112
VA study published last year
p113
aVfound that from birth, from the moment of birth,
p114
aVbabies cry in the accent
p115
aVof their mother's native language.
p116
aVFrench babies cry on a rising note
p117
aVwhile German babies end on a falling note,
p118
aVimitating the melodic contours
p119
aVof those languages.
p120
aVNow why would this kind of fetal learning
p121
aVbe useful?
p122
aVIt may have evolved to aid the baby's survival.
p123
aVFrom the moment of birth,
p124
aVthe baby responds most to the voice
p125
aVof the person who is most likely to care for it \u2014
p126
aVits mother.
p127
aVIt even makes its cries
p128
aVsound like the mother's language,
p129
aVwhich may further endear the baby to the mother,
p130
aVand which may give the baby a head start
p131
aVin the critical task
p132
aVof learning how to understand and speak
p133
aVits native language.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut it's not just sounds
p136
aVthat fetuses are learning about in utero.
p137
aVIt's also tastes and smells.
p138
aVBy seven months of gestation,
p139
aVthe fetus' taste buds are fully developed,
p140
aVand its olfactory receptors, which allow it to smell,
p141
aVare functioning.
p142
aVThe flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats
p143
aVfind their way into the amniotic fluid,
p144
aVwhich is continuously swallowed
p145
aVby the fetus.
p146
aVBabies seem to remember and prefer these tastes
p147
aVonce they're out in the world.
p148
aVIn one experiment, a group of pregnant women
p149
aVwas asked to drink a lot of carrot juice
p150
aVduring their third trimester of pregnancy,
p151
aVwhile another group of pregnant women
p152
aVdrank only water.
p153
aVSix months later, the women's infants
p154
aVwere offered cereal mixed with carrot juice,
p155
aVand their facial expressions were observed while they ate it.
p156
aVThe offspring of the carrot juice drinking women
p157
aVate more carrot-flavored cereal,
p158
aVand from the looks of it,
p159
aVthey seemed to enjoy it more.
p160
aa(lp161
VA sort of French version of this experiment
p162
aVwas carried out in Dijon, France
p163
aVwhere researchers found
p164
aVthat mothers who consumed food and drink
p165
aVflavored with licorice-flavored anise during pregnancy
p166
aVshowed a preference for anise
p167
aVon their first day of life,
p168
aVand again, when they were tested later,
p169
aVon their fourth day of life.
p170
aVBabies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy
p171
aVshowed a reaction that translated roughly as "yuck."
p172
aVWhat this means
p173
aVis that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers
p174
aVabout what is safe and good to eat.
p175
aVFetuses are also being taught
p176
aVabout the particular culture that they'll be joining
p177
aVthrough one of culture's most powerful expressions,
p178
aVwhich is food.
p179
aVThey're being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices
p180
aVof their culture's cuisine
p181
aVeven before birth.
p182
aa(lp183
VNow it turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons.
p184
aVBut before I get to that,
p185
aVI want to address something that you may be wondering about.
p186
aVThe notion of fetal learning
p187
aVmay conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus \u2014
p188
aVlike playing Mozart through headphones
p189
aVplaced on a pregnant belly.
p190
aVBut actually, the nine-month-long process
p191
aVof molding and shaping that goes on in the womb
p192
aVis a lot more visceral and consequential than that.
p193
aVMuch of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life \u2014
p194
aVthe air she breathes,
p195
aVthe food and drink she consumes,
p196
aVthe chemicals she's exposed to,
p197
aVeven the emotions she feels \u2014
p198
aVare shared in some fashion with her fetus.
p199
aVThey make up a mix of influences
p200
aVas individual and idiosyncratic
p201
aVas the woman herself.
p202
aVThe fetus incorporates these offerings
p203
aVinto its own body,
p204
aVmakes them part of its flesh and blood.
p205
aVAnd often it does something more.
p206
aVIt treats these maternal contributions
p207
aVas information,
p208
aVas what I like to call biological postcards
p209
aVfrom the world outside.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo what a fetus is learning about in utero
p212
aVis not Mozart's "Magic Flute"
p213
aVbut answers to questions much more critical to its survival.
p214
aVWill it be born into a world of abundance
p215
aVor scarcity?
p216
aVWill it be safe and protected,
p217
aVor will it face constant dangers and threats?
p218
aVWill it live a long, fruitful life
p219
aVor a short, harried one?
p220
aVThe pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular
p221
aVprovide important clues to prevailing conditions
p222
aVlike a finger lifted to the wind.
p223
aVThe resulting tuning and tweaking
p224
aVof a fetus' brain and other organs
p225
aVare part of what give us humans
p226
aVour enormous flexibility,
p227
aVour ability to thrive
p228
aVin a huge variety of environments,
p229
aVfrom the country to the city,
p230
aVfrom the tundra to the desert.
p231
aa(lp232
VTo conclude, I want to tell you two stories
p233
aVabout how mothers teach their children about the world
p234
aVeven before they're born.
p235
aVIn the autumn of 1944,
p236
aVthe darkest days of World War II,
p237
aVGerman troops blockaded Western Holland,
p238
aVturning away all shipments of food.
p239
aVThe opening of the Nazi's siege
p240
aVwas followed by one of the harshest winters in decades \u2014
p241
aVso cold the water in the canals froze solid.
p242
aVSoon food became scarce,
p243
aVwith many Dutch surviving on just 500 calories a day \u2014
p244
aVa quarter of what they consumed before the war.
p245
aVAs weeks of deprivation stretched into months,
p246
aVsome resorted to eating tulip bulbs.
p247
aVBy the beginning of May,
p248
aVthe nation's carefully rationed food reserve
p249
aVwas completely exhausted.
p250
aVThe specter of mass starvation loomed.
p251
aVAnd then on May 5th, 1945,
p252
aVthe siege came to a sudden end
p253
aVwhen Holland was liberated
p254
aVby the Allies.
p255
aa(lp256
VThe "Hunger Winter," as it came to be known,
p257
aVkilled some 10,000 people
p258
aVand weakened thousands more.
p259
aVBut there was another population that was affected \u2014
p260
aVthe 40,000 fetuses
p261
aVin utero during the siege.
p262
aVSome of the effects of malnutrition during pregnancy
p263
aVwere immediately apparent
p264
aVin higher rates of stillbirths,
p265
aVbirth defects, low birth weights
p266
aVand infant mortality.
p267
aVBut others wouldn't be discovered for many years.
p268
aVDecades after the "Hunger Winter,"
p269
aVresearchers documented
p270
aVthat people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege
p271
aVhave more obesity, more diabetes
p272
aVand more heart disease in later life
p273
aVthan individuals who were gestated under normal conditions.
p274
aVThese individuals' prenatal experience of starvation
p275
aVseems to have changed their bodies
p276
aVin myriad ways.
p277
aVThey have higher blood pressure,
p278
aVpoorer cholesterol profiles
p279
aVand reduced glucose tolerance \u2014
p280
aVa precursor of diabetes.
p281
aa(lp282
VWhy would undernutrition in the womb
p283
aVresult in disease later?
p284
aVOne explanation
p285
aVis that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation.
p286
aVWhen food is scarce,
p287
aVthey divert nutrients towards the really critical organ, the brain,
p288
aVand away from other organs
p289
aVlike the heart and liver.
p290
aVThis keeps the fetus alive in the short-term,
p291
aVbut the bill comes due later on in life
p292
aVwhen those other organs, deprived early on,
p293
aVbecome more susceptible to disease.
p294
aa(lp295
VBut that may not be all that's going on.
p296
aVIt seems that fetuses are taking cues
p297
aVfrom the intrauterine environment
p298
aVand tailoring their physiology accordingly.
p299
aVThey're preparing themselves
p300
aVfor the kind of world they will encounter
p301
aVon the other side of the womb.
p302
aVThe fetus adjusts its metabolism
p303
aVand other physiological processes
p304
aVin anticipation of the environment that awaits it.
p305
aVAnd the basis of the fetus' prediction
p306
aVis what its mother eats.
p307
aVThe meals a pregnant woman consumes
p308
aVconstitute a kind of story,
p309
aVa fairy tale of abundance
p310
aVor a grim chronicle of deprivation.
p311
aVThis story imparts information
p312
aVthat the fetus uses
p313
aVto organize its body and its systems \u2014
p314
aVan adaptation to prevailing circumstances
p315
aVthat facilitates its future survival.
p316
aVFaced with severely limited resources,
p317
aVa smaller-sized child with reduced energy requirements
p318
aVwill, in fact, have a better chance
p319
aVof living to adulthood.
p320
aa(lp321
VThe real trouble comes
p322
aVwhen pregnant women are, in a sense, unreliable narrators,
p323
aVwhen fetuses are led
p324
aVto expect a world of scarcity
p325
aVand are born instead into a world of plenty.
p326
aVThis is what happened to the children of the Dutch "Hunger Winter."
p327
aVAnd their higher rates of obesity,
p328
aVdiabetes and heart disease
p329
aVare the result.
p330
aVBodies that were built to hang onto every calorie
p331
aVfound themselves swimming in the superfluous calories
p332
aVof the post-war Western diet.
p333
aVThe world they had learned about while in utero
p334
aVwas not the same
p335
aVas the world into which they were born.
p336
aa(lp337
VHere's another story.
p338
aVAt 8:46 a.m. on September 11th, 2001,
p339
aVthere were tens of thousands of people
p340
aVin the vicinity of the World Trade Center
p341
aVin New York \u2014
p342
aVcommuters spilling off trains,
p343
aVwaitresses setting tables for the morning rush,
p344
aVbrokers already working the phones on Wall Street.
p345
aV1,700 of these people were pregnant women.
p346
aVWhen the planes struck and the towers collapsed,
p347
aVmany of these women experienced the same horrors
p348
aVinflicted on other survivors of the disaster \u2014
p349
aVthe overwhelming chaos and confusion,
p350
aVthe rolling clouds
p351
aVof potentially toxic dust and debris,
p352
aVthe heart-pounding fear for their lives.
p353
aa(lp354
VAbout a year after 9/11,
p355
aVresearchers examined a group of women
p356
aVwho were pregnant
p357
aVwhen they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack.
p358
aVIn the babies of those women
p359
aVwho developed post-traumatic stress syndrome, or PTSD,
p360
aVfollowing their ordeal,
p361
aVresearchers discovered a biological marker
p362
aVof susceptibility to PTSD \u2014
p363
aVan effect that was most pronounced
p364
aVin infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophe
p365
aVin their third trimester.
p366
aVIn other words,
p367
aVthe mothers with post-traumatic stress syndrome
p368
aVhad passed on a vulnerability to the condition
p369
aVto their children while they were still in utero.
p370
aa(lp371
VNow consider this:
p372
aVpost-traumatic stress syndrome
p373
aVappears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong,
p374
aVcausing its victims tremendous unnecessary suffering.
p375
aVBut there's another way of thinking about PTSD.
p376
aVWhat looks like pathology to us
p377
aVmay actually be a useful adaptation
p378
aVin some circumstances.
p379
aVIn a particularly dangerous environment,
p380
aVthe characteristic manifestations of PTSD \u2014
p381
aVa hyper-awareness of one's surroundings,
p382
aVa quick-trigger response to danger \u2014
p383
aVcould save someone's life.
p384
aVThe notion that the prenatal transmission of PTSD risk is adaptive
p385
aVis still speculative,
p386
aVbut I find it rather poignant.
p387
aVIt would mean that, even before birth,
p388
aVmothers are warning their children
p389
aVthat it's a wild world out there,
p390
aVtelling them, "Be careful."
p391
aa(lp392
VLet me be clear.
p393
aVFetal origins research is not about blaming women
p394
aVfor what happens during pregnancy.
p395
aVIt's about discovering how best to promote
p396
aVthe health and well-being of the next generation.
p397
aVThat important effort must include a focus
p398
aVon what fetuses learn
p399
aVduring the nine months they spend in the womb.
p400
aVLearning is one of life's most essential activities,
p401
aVand it begins much earlier
p402
aVthan we ever imagined.
