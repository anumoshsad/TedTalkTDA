VHello.
p4
aVThis is my first trip,
p5
aVfirst time in life I'm outside of the walls of Gaza.
p6
aVI'm so happy to be here.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Applause)
p9
aa(lp10
VMy ambition always was to be a pilot, to fly a plane,
p11
aVto feel free to fly the sky, to touch the sky.
p12
aVBut that didn't happen.
p13
aVSimply, I live in Gaza, there is no airport.
p14
aVAll borders are closed on every side.
p15
aVWe live in one of the biggest prisons in the world.
p16
aVThe only thing I can do is just to look up to the sky.
p17
aVOn some days, we are lucky if we have electricity
p18
aVfor four or five hours.
p19
aVWhen it's cold, we make a fire on the front or on the roof of our homes.
p20
aVSometimes we make food, too.
p21
aa(lp22
VMy job in Gaza is to arrange everything for journalists who come to my homeland
p23
aVto tell the stories about what's going on in Gaza.
p24
aVMany mornings, I had to go to the border area
p25
aVto collect a journalist.
p26
aVIf anything should happen to the journalist,
p27
aVor if the journalist decides to cover a story
p28
aVthe government doesn't want us to cover,
p29
aVbad things could happen.
p30
aa(lp31
VNavigating through my country helping journalists,
p32
aVfilmmakers, news crews, is my working life.
p33
aVI believe my success comes from building a relationship
p34
aVnot only with journalists and the news crews,
p35
aVbut also with the communities in the Gaza Strip.
p36
aVThese communities who don't want their stories to be told,
p37
aVI never looked to them as stories or numbers.
p38
aVBut like me, they are human beings.
p39
aa(lp40
VI have built up many relationships over 10 years.
p41
aVAnd guess what?
p42
aVThis gives me the chance to get access to people,
p43
aVto stories that others can't.
p44
aVIn some certain situations, I feel, as a woman, I have more power.
p45
aVMany male journalists in my society,
p46
aVthey want to cover a story about drug addiction in my country.
p47
aVThat problem started when the Gaza tunnel was being built.
p48
aVWith the siege on Gaza,
p49
aVtunnels brought people all the basic needs
p50
aVlike food, building material, other stuff we needed.
p51
aVBut not anymore, because the Egyptian side flooded them up with water
p52
aVand they are not working anymore.
p53
aVDrugs were being smuggled,
p54
aVand many young people got addicted, too.
p55
aVIn the tradition of the Palestinian society,
p56
aVit's forbidden for men to enter the household.
p57
aVSo, no male journalists get the story.
p58
aVBut I did.
p59
aa(lp60
VI have a wonderful husband,
p61
aVa wonderful husband who supports me
p62
aVdespite all the criticism he gets from the society.
p63
aVHe's at home now with my two kids,
p64
aVand I have another one that's growing in here.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Applause)
p67
aa(lp68
VWhen I'm working, I call him every two hours,
p69
aVand he knows if he doesn't hear from me,
p70
aVhe should call my contact,
p71
aVthe one who gives me access to the story,
p72
aVwhich is the one who I trust.
p73
aa(lp74
VOne of the times in Gaza,
p75
aVduring the kidnapping of the British journalist Alan Johnston,
p76
aVI was asked by an American magazine
p77
aVto set up a meeting with the kidnappers in Gaza, and I did.
p78
aVThe journalist covering the story and I
p79
aVwere asked to meet outside of his hotel.
p80
aVThey came, they picked us up in a black van with black windows,
p81
aVthey were wearing masks on that day.
p82
aVAnd they drove us away, far away in the middle of a field.
p83
aVThey took our cell phones
p84
aVand we did the interview with the kidnapper outside in that field.
p85
aVI was so scared that day,
p86
aVa day I will never forget.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo, why do I do what I do?
p89
aVI do it because I believe if I didn't,
p90
aVa huge part of the story about Gaza will be missing.
p91
aVThere are some more stories I could tell you about my country.
p92
aVAnd not all of them are bad.
p93
aVI love my country, despite the terrible situation we live in \u2014
p94
aVsiege, poverty, unemployment \u2014
p95
aVbut there is life.
p96
aVThere are people who are dreamers and amazing people full of energy.
p97
aVWe have wonderful music, and a great music school.
p98
aVWe have parkour dancers who dance in the rubble of their homes.
p99
aVAnd Gaza is the only place in the Arab world
p100
aVwhere Muslims and Christians live in strong brotherhood.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Applause)
p103
aa(lp104
VDuring the time of war,
p105
aVthe hardest part for me is leaving the house early in the morning,
p106
aVleaving my children.
p107
aVI take a picture of them everyday
p108
aVbecause I never know if I will make it back to them.
p109
aVBeing a fixer and a journalist is difficult and dangerous in Gaza.
p110
aVBut when I hear the sound of the shelling or the sound of the bombing,
p111
aVI just head straight toward it,
p112
aVbecause I want to be there first,
p113
aVbecause these stories should be told.
p114
aa(lp115
VWhen my children were small and we heard the sound of the war,
p116
aVI used to tell them that they were fireworks.
p117
aVNow they are older, they understand.
p118
aVI do have terrible nightmares
p119
aVbecause of all that I witnessed during war times,
p120
aVespecially these lifeless bodies of young children.
p121
aVI still remember a little girl, her name is Hala.
p122
aVShe's the only survivor from her family.
p123
aVHer picture will be with me forever.
p124
aVI will never forget her.
p125
aa(lp126
VI'm proud that I can stand here and be here today with you.
p127
aVI'm proud that I can tell you stories, sad and happy,
p128
aVstories about my small corner of the world, Gaza.
p129
aVI'm proud that I am the first female fixer working in Gaza.
p130
aVAnd the funny thing is they call me Mr. Rambo in Gaza.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VI hope one day, I will get the chance to tell the stories of all other women,
p135
aVall other amazing women I know in my country.
p136
aVI hope that one day I can help other women in my country
p137
aVto be fixers like me.
p138
aVAnd of course sometimes, I feel I can't do this work anymore,
p139
aVit's just too much for me.
p140
aVBut I remember these words:
p141
aV"Don't limit your challenge, but challenge your limit.
p142
aVDon't allow others to stand in front of your dreams."
p143
aa(lp144
VThank you.
