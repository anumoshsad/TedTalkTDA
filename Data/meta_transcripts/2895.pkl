VSo there's a lot of valid concern these days
p4
aVthat our technology is getting so smart
p5
aVthat we've put ourselves on the path to a jobless future.
p6
aVAnd I think the example of a self-driving car
p7
aVis actually the easiest one to see.
p8
aVSo these are going to be fantastic for all kinds of different reasons.
p9
aVBut did you know that "driver" is actually the most common job
p10
aVin 29 of the 50 US states?
p11
aVWhat's going to happen to these jobs when we're no longer driving our cars
p12
aVor cooking our food
p13
aVor even diagnosing our own diseases?
p14
aa(lp15
VWell, a recent study from Forrester Research
p16
aVgoes so far to predict that 25 million jobs
p17
aVmight disappear over the next 10 years.
p18
aVTo put that in perspective,
p19
aVthat's three times as many jobs lost in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
p20
aVAnd it's not just blue-collar jobs that are at risk.
p21
aVOn Wall Street and across Silicon Valley, we are seeing tremendous gains
p22
aVin the quality of analysis and decision-making
p23
aVbecause of machine learning.
p24
aVSo even the smartest, highest-paid people will be affected by this change.
p25
aa(lp26
VWhat's clear is that no matter what your job is,
p27
aVat least some, if not all of your work,
p28
aVis going to be done by a robot or software in the next few years.
p29
aVAnd that's exactly why people like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates
p30
aVare talking about the need for government-funded minimum income levels.
p31
aVBut if our politicians can't agree on things like health care
p32
aVor even school lunches,
p33
aVI just don't see a path where they'll find consensus
p34
aVon something as big and as expensive as universal basic life income.
p35
aVInstead, I think the response needs to be led by us in industry.
p36
aVWe have to recognize the change that's ahead of us
p37
aVand start to design the new kinds of jobs
p38
aVthat will still be relevant in the age of robotics.
p39
aa(lp40
VThe good news is that we have faced down and recovered
p41
aVtwo mass extinctions of jobs before.
p42
aVFrom 1870 to 1970,
p43
aVthe percent of American workers based on farms fell by 90 percent,
p44
aVand then again from 1950 to 2010,
p45
aVthe percent of Americans working in factories
p46
aVfell by 75 percent.
p47
aVThe challenge we face this time, however, is one of time.
p48
aVWe had a hundred years to move from farms to factories,
p49
aVand then 60 years to fully build out a service economy.
p50
aVThe rate of change today
p51
aVsuggests that we may only have 10 or 15 years to adjust,
p52
aVand if we don't react fast enough,
p53
aVthat means by the time today's elementary-school students
p54
aVare college-aged,
p55
aVwe could be living in a world that's robotic,
p56
aVlargely unemployed and stuck in kind of un-great depression.
p57
aa(lp58
VBut I don't think it has to be this way.
p59
aVYou see, I work in innovation,
p60
aVand part of my job is to shape how large companies apply new technologies.
p61
aVCertainly some of these technologies
p62
aVare even specifically designed to replace human workers.
p63
aVBut I believe that if we start taking steps right now
p64
aVto change the nature of work,
p65
aVwe can not only create environments where people love coming to work
p66
aVbut also generate the innovation that we need
p67
aVto replace the millions of jobs that will be lost to technology.
p68
aVI believe that the key to preventing our jobless future
p69
aVis to rediscover what makes us human,
p70
aVand to create a new generation of human-centered jobs
p71
aVthat allow us to unlock the hidden talents and passions
p72
aVthat we carry with us every day.
p73
aa(lp74
VBut first, I think it's important to recognize
p75
aVthat we brought this problem on ourselves.
p76
aVAnd it's not just because, you know, we are the one building the robots.
p77
aVBut even though most jobs left the factory decades ago,
p78
aVwe still hold on to this factory mindset
p79
aVof standardization and de-skilling.
p80
aVWe still define jobs around procedural tasks
p81
aVand then pay people for the number of hours that they perform these tasks.
p82
aVWe've created narrow job definitions
p83
aVlike cashier, loan processor or taxi driver
p84
aVand then asked people to form entire careers
p85
aVaround these singular tasks.
p86
aa(lp87
VThese choices have left us with actually two dangerous side effects.
p88
aVThe first is that these narrowly defined jobs
p89
aVwill be the first to be displaced by robots,
p90
aVbecause single-task robots are just the easiest kinds to build.
p91
aVBut second, we have accidentally made it
p92
aVso that millions of workers around the world
p93
aVhave unbelievably boring working lives.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VLet's take the example of a call center agent.
p98
aVOver the last few decades, we brag about lower operating costs
p99
aVbecause we've taken most of the need for brainpower
p100
aVout of the person and put it into the system.
p101
aVFor most of their day, they click on screens,
p102
aVthey read scripts.
p103
aVThey act more like machines than humans.
p104
aVAnd unfortunately, over the next few years,
p105
aVas our technology gets more advanced,
p106
aVthey, along with people like clerks and bookkeepers,
p107
aVwill see the vast majority of their work disappear.
p108
aa(lp109
VTo counteract this, we have to start creating new jobs
p110
aVthat are less centered on the tasks that a person does
p111
aVand more focused on the skills that a person brings to work.
p112
aVFor example, robots are great at repetitive and constrained work,
p113
aVbut human beings have an amazing ability
p114
aVto bring together capability with creativity
p115
aVwhen faced with problems that we've never seen before.
p116
aVIt's when every day brings a little bit of a surprise
p117
aVthat we have designed work for humans
p118
aVand not for robots.
p119
aVOur entrepreneurs and engineers already live in this world,
p120
aVbut so do our nurses and our plumbers
p121
aVand our therapists.
p122
aVYou know, it's the nature of too many companies and organizations
p123
aVto just ask people to come to work and do your job.
p124
aVBut if you work is better done by a robot,
p125
aVor your decisions better made by an AI,
p126
aVwhat are you supposed to be doing?
p127
aa(lp128
VWell, I think for the manager,
p129
aVwe need to realistically think about the tasks that will be disappearing
p130
aVover the next few years
p131
aVand start planning for more meaningful, more valuable work that should replace it.
p132
aVWe need to create environments
p133
aVwhere both human beings and robots thrive.
p134
aVI say, let's give more work to the robots,
p135
aVand let's start with the work that we absolutely hate doing.
p136
aVHere, robot,
p137
aVprocess this painfully idiotic report.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd move this box. Thank you.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd for the human beings,
p146
aVwe should follow the advice from Harry Davis at the University of Chicago.
p147
aVHe says we have to make it so that people don't leave too much of themselves
p148
aVin the trunk of their car.
p149
aVI mean, human beings are amazing on weekends.
p150
aVThink about the people that you know and what they do on Saturdays.
p151
aVThey're artists, carpenters, chefs and athletes.
p152
aVBut on Monday, they're back to being Junior HR Specialist
p153
aVand Systems Analyst 3.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VYou know, these narrow job titles not only sound boring,
p158
aVbut they're actually a subtle encouragement
p159
aVfor people to make narrow and boring job contributions.
p160
aVBut I've seen firsthand that when you invite people to be more,
p161
aVthey can amaze us with how much more they can be.
p162
aa(lp163
VA few years ago, I was working at a large bank
p164
aVthat was trying to bring more innovation into its company culture.
p165
aVSo my team and I designed a prototyping contest
p166
aVthat invited anyone to build anything that they wanted.
p167
aVWe were actually trying to figure out
p168
aVwhether or not the primary limiter to innovation
p169
aVwas a lack of ideas or a lack of talent,
p170
aVand it turns out it was neither one.
p171
aVIt was an empowerment problem.
p172
aVAnd the results of the program were amazing.
p173
aVWe started by inviting people to reenvision
p174
aVwhat it is they could bring to a team.
p175
aVThis contest was not only a chance to build anything that you wanted
p176
aVbut also be anything that you wanted.
p177
aVAnd when people were no longer limited by their day-to-day job titles,
p178
aVthey felt free to bring all kinds of different skills and talents
p179
aVto the problems that they were trying to solve.
p180
aVWe saw technology people being designers, marketing people being architects,
p181
aVand even finance people showing off their ability to write jokes.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VWe ran this program twice,
p186
aVand each time more than 400 people brought their unexpected talents to work
p187
aVand solved problems that they had been wanting to solve for years.
p188
aVCollectively, they created millions of dollars of value,
p189
aVbuilding things like a better touch-tone system for call centers,
p190
aVeasier desktop tools for branches
p191
aVand even a thank you card system
p192
aVthat has become a cornerstone of the employee working experience.
p193
aVOver the course of the eight weeks,
p194
aVpeople flexed muscles that they never dreamed of using at work.
p195
aVPeople learned new skills,
p196
aVthey met new people,
p197
aVand at the end, somebody pulled me aside and said,
p198
aV"I have to tell you,
p199
aVthe last few weeks has been one of the most intense,
p200
aVhardest working experiences of my entire life,
p201
aVbut not one second of it felt like work."
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd that's the key.
p204
aVFor those few weeks, people got to be creators and innovators.
p205
aVThey had been dreaming of solutions
p206
aVto problems that had been bugging them for years,
p207
aVand this was a chance to turn those dreams into a reality.
p208
aVAnd that dreaming is an important part of what separates us from machines.
p209
aVFor now, our machines do not get frustrated,
p210
aVthey do not get annoyed,
p211
aVand they certainly don't imagine.
p212
aa(lp213
VBut we, as human beings \u2014
p214
aVwe feel pain,
p215
aVwe get frustrated.
p216
aVAnd it's when we're most annoyed and most curious
p217
aVthat we're motivated to dig into a problem and create change.
p218
aVOur imaginations are the birthplace of new products, new services,
p219
aVand even new industries.
p220
aa(lp221
VI believe that the jobs of the future
p222
aVwill come from the minds of people
p223
aVwho today we call analysts and specialists,
p224
aVbut only if we give them the freedom and protection that they need to grow
p225
aVinto becoming explorers and inventors.
p226
aVIf we really want to robot-proof our jobs,
p227
aVwe, as leaders, need to get out of the mindset
p228
aVof telling people what to do
p229
aVand instead start asking them what problems they're inspired to solve
p230
aVand what talents they want to bring to work.
p231
aVBecause when you can bring your Saturday self to work on Wednesdays,
p232
aVyou'll look forward to Mondays more,
p233
aVand those feelings that we have about Mondays
p234
aVare part of what makes us human.
p235
aa(lp236
VAnd as we redesign work for an era of intelligent machines,
p237
aVI invite you all to work alongside me
p238
aVto bring more humanity to our working lives.
p239
aa(lp240
VThank you.
