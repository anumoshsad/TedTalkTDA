VI have a question.
p4
aVCan a computer write poetry?
p5
aVThis is a provocative question.
p6
aVYou think about it for a minute,
p7
aVand you suddenly have a bunch of other questions like:
p8
aVWhat is a computer?
p9
aVWhat is poetry?
p10
aVWhat is creativity?
p11
aVBut these are questions
p12
aVthat people spend their entire lifetime trying to answer,
p13
aVnot in a single TED Talk.
p14
aVSo we're going to have to try a different approach.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo up here, we have two poems.
p17
aVOne of them is written by a human,
p18
aVand the other one's written by a computer.
p19
aVI'm going to ask you to tell me which one's which.
p20
aVHave a go:
p21
aa(lp22
VPoem 1: Little Fly / Thy summer's play, / My thoughtless hand / Has brush'd away.
p23
aVAm I not / A fly like thee? / Or art not thou / A man like me?
p24
aa(lp25
VPoem 2: We can feel / Activist through your life's / morning /
p26
aVPauses to see, pope I hate the / Non all the night to start a / great otherwise (...)
p27
aa(lp28
VAlright, time's up.
p29
aVHands up if you think Poem 1 was written by a human.
p30
aVOK, most of you.
p31
aVHands up if you think Poem 2 was written by a human.
p32
aVVery brave of you,
p33
aVbecause the first one was written by the human poet William Blake.
p34
aVThe second one was written by an algorithm
p35
aVthat took all the language from my Facebook feed on one day
p36
aVand then regenerated it algorithmically,
p37
aVaccording to methods that I'll describe a little bit later on.
p38
aVSo let's try another test.
p39
aVAgain, you haven't got ages to read this,
p40
aVso just trust your gut.
p41
aa(lp42
VPoem 1: A lion roars and a dog barks. It is interesting / and fascinating
p43
aVthat a bird will fly and not / roar or bark. Enthralling stories about animals
p44
aVare in my dreams and I will sing them all if I / am not exhausted or weary.
p45
aa(lp46
VPoem 2: Oh! kangaroos, sequins, chocolate sodas! / You are really beautiful!
p47
aVPearls, / harmonicas, jujubes, aspirins! All / the stuff they've always talked about (...)
p48
aa(lp49
VAlright, time's up.
p50
aVSo if you think the first poem was written by a human,
p51
aVput your hand up.
p52
aVOK.
p53
aVAnd if you think the second poem was written by a human,
p54
aVput your hand up.
p55
aVWe have, more or less, a 50/50 split here.
p56
aVIt was much harder.
p57
aa(lp58
VThe answer is,
p59
aVthe first poem was generated by an algorithm called Racter,
p60
aVthat was created back in the 1970s,
p61
aVand the second poem was written by a guy called Frank O'Hara,
p62
aVwho happens to be one of my favorite human poets.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VSo what we've just done now is a Turing test for poetry.
p67
aVThe Turing test was first proposed by this guy, Alan Turing, in 1950,
p68
aVin order to answer the question,
p69
aVcan computers think?
p70
aVAlan Turing believed that if a computer was able
p71
aVto have a to have a text-based conversation with a human,
p72
aVwith such proficiency such that the human couldn't tell
p73
aVwhether they are talking to a computer or a human,
p74
aVthen the computer can be said to have intelligence.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo in 2013, my friend Benjamin Laird and I,
p77
aVwe created a Turing test for poetry online.
p78
aVIt's called bot or not,
p79
aVand you can go and play it for yourselves.
p80
aVBut basically, it's the game we just played.
p81
aVYou're presented with a poem,
p82
aVyou don't know whether it was written by a human or a computer
p83
aVand you have to guess.
p84
aVSo thousands and thousands of people have taken this test online,
p85
aVso we have results.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd what are the results?
p88
aVWell, Turing said that if a computer could fool a human
p89
aV30 percent of the time that it was a human,
p90
aVthen it passes the Turing test for intelligence.
p91
aVWe have poems on the bot or not database
p92
aVthat have fooled 65 percent of human readers into thinking
p93
aVit was written by a human.
p94
aVSo, I think we have an answer to our question.
p95
aVAccording to the logic of the Turing test,
p96
aVcan a computer write poetry?
p97
aVWell, yes, absolutely it can.
p98
aVBut if you're feeling a little bit uncomfortable
p99
aVwith this answer, that's OK.
p100
aVIf you're having a bunch of gut reactions to it,
p101
aVthat's also OK because this isn't the end of the story.
p102
aa(lp103
VLet's play our third and final test.
p104
aVAgain, you're going to have to read
p105
aVand tell me which you think is human.
p106
aa(lp107
VPoem 1: Red flags the reason for pretty flags. / And ribbons.
p108
aVRibbons of flags / And wearing material / Reasons for wearing material. (...)
p109
aa(lp110
VPoem 2: A wounded deer leaps highest, / I've heard the daffodil
p111
aVI've heard the flag to-day / I've heard the hunter tell; /
p112
aV'Tis but the ecstasy of death, / And then the brake is almost done (...)
p113
aa(lp114
VOK, time is up.
p115
aVSo hands up if you think Poem 1 was written by a human.
p116
aVHands up if you think Poem 2 was written by a human.
p117
aVWhoa, that's a lot more people.
p118
aVSo you'd be surprised to find that Poem 1
p119
aVwas written by the very human poet Gertrude Stein.
p120
aVAnd Poem 2 was generated by an algorithm called RKCP.
p121
aVNow before we go on, let me describe very quickly and simply,
p122
aVhow RKCP works.
p123
aVSo RKCP is an algorithm designed by Ray Kurzweil,
p124
aVwho's a director of engineering at Google
p125
aVand a firm believer in artificial intelligence.
p126
aVSo, you give RKCP a source text,
p127
aVit analyzes the source text in order to find out how it uses language,
p128
aVand then it regenerates language
p129
aVthat emulates that first text.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo in the poem we just saw before,
p132
aVPoem 2, the one that you all thought was human,
p133
aVit was fed a bunch of poems
p134
aVby a poet called Emily Dickinson
p135
aVit looked at the way she used language,
p136
aVlearned the model,
p137
aVand then it regenerated a model according to that same structure.
p138
aVBut the important thing to know about RKCP
p139
aVis that it doesn't know the meaning of the words it's using.
p140
aVThe language is just raw material,
p141
aVit could be Chinese, it could be in Swedish,
p142
aVit could be the collected language from your Facebook feed for one day.
p143
aVIt's just raw material.
p144
aVAnd nevertheless, it's able to create a poem
p145
aVthat seems more human than Gertrude Stein's poem,
p146
aVand Gertrude Stein is a human.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo what we've done here is, more or less, a reverse Turing test.
p149
aVSo Gertrude Stein, who's a human, is able to write a poem
p150
aVthat fools a majority of human judges into thinking
p151
aVthat it was written by a computer.
p152
aVTherefore, according to the logic of the reverse Turing test,
p153
aVGertrude Stein is a computer.
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VFeeling confused?
p158
aVI think that's fair enough.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo far we've had humans that write like humans,
p161
aVwe have computers that write like computers,
p162
aVwe have computers that write like humans,
p163
aVbut we also have, perhaps most confusingly,
p164
aVhumans that write like computers.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo what do we take from all of this?
p167
aVDo we take that William Blake is somehow more of a human
p168
aVthan Gertrude Stein?
p169
aVOr that Gertrude Stein is more of a computer than William Blake?
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VThese are questions I've been asking myself
p174
aVfor around two years now,
p175
aVand I don't have any answers.
p176
aVBut what I do have are a bunch of insights
p177
aVabout our relationship with technology.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo my first insight is that, for some reason,
p180
aVwe associate poetry with being human.
p181
aVSo that when we ask, "Can a computer write poetry?"
p182
aVwe're also asking,
p183
aV"What does it mean to be human
p184
aVand how do we put boundaries around this category?
p185
aVHow do we say who or what can be part of this category?"
p186
aVThis is an essentially philosophical question, I believe,
p187
aVand it can't be answered with a yes or no test,
p188
aVlike the Turing test.
p189
aVI also believe that Alan Turing understood this,
p190
aVand that when he devised his test back in 1950,
p191
aVhe was doing it as a philosophical provocation.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo my second insight is that, when we take the Turing test for poetry,
p194
aVwe're not really testing the capacity of the computers
p195
aVbecause poetry-generating algorithms,
p196
aVthey're pretty simple and have existed, more or less, since the 1950s.
p197
aVWhat we are doing with the Turing test for poetry, rather,
p198
aVis collecting opinions about what constitutes humanness.
p199
aVSo, what I've figured out,
p200
aVwe've seen this when earlier today,
p201
aVwe say that William Blake is more of a human
p202
aVthan Gertrude Stein.
p203
aVOf course, this doesn't mean that William Blake
p204
aVwas actually more human
p205
aVor that Gertrude Stein was more of a computer.
p206
aVIt simply means that the category of the human is unstable.
p207
aVThis has led me to understand
p208
aVthat the human is not a cold, hard fact.
p209
aVRather, it is something that's constructed with our opinions
p210
aVand something that changes over time.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo my final insight is that the computer, more or less,
p213
aVworks like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human
p214
aVthat we show it.
p215
aVWe show it Emily Dickinson,
p216
aVit gives Emily Dickinson back to us.
p217
aVWe show it William Blake,
p218
aVthat's what it reflects back to us.
p219
aVWe show it Gertrude Stein,
p220
aVwhat we get back is Gertrude Stein.
p221
aVMore than any other bit of technology,
p222
aVthe computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the human we teach it.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing
p225
aVa lot about artificial intelligence recently.
p226
aVAnd much of the conversation is,
p227
aVcan we build it?
p228
aVCan we build an intelligent computer?
p229
aVCan we build a creative computer?
p230
aVWhat we seem to be asking over and over
p231
aVis can we build a human-like computer?
p232
aa(lp233
VBut what we've seen just now
p234
aVis that the human is not a scientific fact,
p235
aVthat it's an ever-shifting, concatenating idea
p236
aVand one that changes over time.
p237
aVSo that when we begin to grapple with the ideas
p238
aVof artificial intelligence in the future,
p239
aVwe shouldn't only be asking ourselves,
p240
aV"Can we build it?"
p241
aVBut we should also be asking ourselves,
p242
aV"What idea of the human do we want to have reflected back to us?"
p243
aVThis is an essentially philosophical idea,
p244
aVand it's one that can't be answered with software alone,
p245
aVbut I think requires a moment of species-wide, existential reflection.
p246
