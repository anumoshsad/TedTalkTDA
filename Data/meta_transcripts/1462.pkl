VMy talk today is about something
p4
aVmaybe a couple of you have already heard about.
p5
aVIt's called the Arab Spring.
p6
aVAnyone heard of it?
p7
aa(lp8
V(Applause)
p9
aa(lp10
VSo in 2011, power shifted,
p11
aVfrom the few to the many,
p12
aVfrom oval offices to central squares,
p13
aVfrom carefully guarded airwaves
p14
aVto open-source networks.
p15
aVBut before Tahrir was a global symbol of liberation,
p16
aVthere were representative surveys
p17
aValready giving people a voice
p18
aVin quieter but still powerful ways.
p19
aa(lp20
VI study Muslim societies around the world at Gallup.
p21
aVSince 2001,
p22
aVwe've interviewed hundreds of thousands of people \u2014
p23
aVyoung and old, men and women,
p24
aVeducated and illiterate.
p25
aVMy talk today draws on this research
p26
aVto reveal why Arabs rose up
p27
aVand what they want now.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow this region's very diverse,
p30
aVand every country is unique.
p31
aVBut those who revolted
p32
aVshared a common set of grievances
p33
aVand have similar demands today.
p34
aVI'm going to focus a lot of my talk on Egypt.
p35
aVIt has nothing to do with the fact that I was born there, of course.
p36
aVBut it's the largest Arab country
p37
aVand it's also one with a great deal of influence.
p38
aVBut I'm going to end by widening the lens to the entire region
p39
aVto look at the mundane topics
p40
aVof Arab views of religion and politics
p41
aVand how this impacts women,
p42
aVrevealing some surprises along the way.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo after analyzing mounds of data,
p45
aVwhat we discovered was this:
p46
aVUnemployment and poverty alone
p47
aVdid not lead to the Arab revolts of 2011.
p48
aVIf an act of desperation by a Tunisian fruit vendor
p49
aVsparked these revolutions,
p50
aVit was the difference between what Arabs experienced
p51
aVand what they expected
p52
aVthat provided the fuel.
p53
aa(lp54
VTo tell you what I mean,
p55
aVconsider this trend in Egypt.
p56
aVOn paper the country was doing great.
p57
aVIn fact, it attracted accolades
p58
aVfrom multinational organizations
p59
aVbecause of its economic growth.
p60
aVBut under the surface was a very different reality.
p61
aVIn 2010, right before the revolution,
p62
aVeven though GDP per capita
p63
aVhad been growing at five percent for several years,
p64
aVEgyptians had never felt worse about their lives.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow this is very unusual,
p67
aVbecause globally we find that, not surprisingly,
p68
aVpeople feel better as their country gets richer.
p69
aVAnd that's because they have better job opportunities
p70
aVand their state offers better social services.
p71
aVBut it was exactly the opposite in Egypt.
p72
aVAs the country got more well-off,
p73
aVunemployment actually rose
p74
aVand people's satisfaction
p75
aVwith things like housing and education plummeted.
p76
aVBut it wasn't just anger at economic injustice.
p77
aVIt was also people's deep longing for freedom.
p78
aVContrary to the clash of civilizations theory,
p79
aVArabs didn't despise Western liberty,
p80
aVthey desired it.
p81
aa(lp82
VAs early as 2001,
p83
aVwe asked Arabs, and Muslims in general around the world,
p84
aVwhat they admired most about the West.
p85
aVAmong the most frequent responses
p86
aVwas liberty and justice.
p87
aVIn their own words to an open-ended question
p88
aVwe heard, "Their political system is transparent
p89
aVand it's following democracy in its true sense."
p90
aVAnother said it was "liberty and freedom
p91
aVand being open-minded with each other."
p92
aVMajorities as high as 90 percent and greater
p93
aVin Egypt, Indonesia and Iran
p94
aVtold us in 2005
p95
aVthat if they were to write a new constitution
p96
aVfor a theoretical new country
p97
aVthat they would guarantee freedom of speech
p98
aVas a fundamental right,
p99
aVespecially in Egypt.
p100
aVEighty-eight percent said moving toward greater democracy
p101
aVwould help Muslims progress \u2014
p102
aVthe highest percentage of any country we surveyed.
p103
aa(lp104
VBut pressed up against these democratic aspirations
p105
aVwas a very different day-to-day experience,
p106
aVespecially in Egypt.
p107
aVWhile aspiring to democracy the most,
p108
aVthey were the least likely population in the world
p109
aVto say that they had actually voiced their opinion
p110
aVto a public official in the last month \u2014
p111
aVat only four percent.
p112
aVSo while economic development made a few people rich,
p113
aVit left many more worse off.
p114
aVAs people felt less and less free,
p115
aVthey also felt less and less provided for.
p116
aVSo rather than viewing their former regimes
p117
aVas generous if overprotective fathers,
p118
aVthey viewed them as essentially prison wardens.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo now that Egyptians have ended Mubarak's 30-year rule,
p121
aVthey potentially could be
p122
aVan example for the region.
p123
aVIf Egypt is to succeed
p124
aVat building a society based on the rule of law,
p125
aVit could be a model.
p126
aVIf, however,
p127
aVthe core issues that propelled the revolution aren't addressed,
p128
aVthe consequences could be catastrophic \u2014
p129
aVnot just for Egypt,
p130
aVbut for the entire region.
p131
aa(lp132
VThe signs don't look good, some have said.
p133
aVIslamists, not the young liberals that sparked the revolution,
p134
aVwon the majority in Parliament.
p135
aVThe military council
p136
aVhas cracked down on civil society and protests
p137
aVand the country's economy continues to suffer.
p138
aVEvaluating Egypt on this basis alone, however,
p139
aVignores the real revolution.
p140
aVBecause Egyptians are more optimistic
p141
aVthan they have been in years,
p142
aVfar less divided on religious-secular lines
p143
aVthan we would think
p144
aVand poised for the demands of democracy.
p145
aa(lp146
VWhether they support Islamists or liberals,
p147
aVEgyptians' priorities for this government are identical,
p148
aVand they are jobs, stability and education,
p149
aVnot moral policing.
p150
aVBut most of all,
p151
aVfor the first time in decades,
p152
aVthey expect to be active participants, not spectators,
p153
aVin the affairs of their country.
p154
aa(lp155
VI was meeting with a group of newly-elected parliamentarians
p156
aVfrom Egypt and Tunisia
p157
aVa couple of weeks ago.
p158
aVAnd what really struck me about them
p159
aVwas that they weren't only optimistic,
p160
aVbut they kind of struck me as nervous,
p161
aVfor lack of a better word.
p162
aVOne said to me,
p163
aV"Our people used to gather in cafes to watch football" \u2014
p164
aVor soccer, as we say in America \u2014
p165
aV"and now they gather to watch Parliament."
p166
aV(Laughter)
p167
aV"They're really watching us,
p168
aVand we can't help but worry
p169
aVthat we're not going to live up to their expectations."
p170
aVAnd what really struck me
p171
aVis that less than 24 months ago,
p172
aVit was the people that were nervous
p173
aVabout being watched by their government.
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd the reason that they're expecting a lot
p176
aVis because they have a new-found hope for the future.
p177
aVSo right before the revolution
p178
aVwe said that Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives,
p179
aVbut not only that, they thought their future would be no better.
p180
aVWhat really changed after the ouster of Mubarak
p181
aVwasn't that life got easier.
p182
aVIt actually got harder.
p183
aVBut people's expectations for their future
p184
aVwent up significantly.
p185
aVAnd this hope, this optimism,
p186
aVendured a year of turbulent transition.
p187
aa(lp188
VOne reason that there's this optimism
p189
aVis because, contrary to what many people have said,
p190
aVmost Egyptians think things really have changed in many ways.
p191
aVSo while Egyptians were known
p192
aVfor their single-digit turnout
p193
aVin elections before the revolution,
p194
aVthe last election had around 70 percent voter turnout \u2014
p195
aVmen and women.
p196
aVWhere scarcely a quarter believed in the honesty of elections in 2010 \u2014
p197
aVI'm surprised it was a quarter \u2014
p198
aV90 percent thought that this last election was honest.
p199
aVNow why this matters
p200
aVis because we discovered a link
p201
aVbetween people's faith in their democratic process
p202
aVand their faith that oppressed people
p203
aVcan change their situation
p204
aVthrough peaceful means alone.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Applause)
p207
aa(lp208
VNow I know what some of you are thinking.
p209
aVThe Egyptian people,
p210
aVand many other Arabs who've revolted and are in transition,
p211
aVhave very high expectations of the government.
p212
aVThey're just victims of a long-time autocracy,
p213
aVexpecting a paternal state
p214
aVto solve all their problems.
p215
aVBut this conclusion would ignore
p216
aVa tectonic shift taking place in Egypt
p217
aVfar from the cameras in Tahrir Square.
p218
aVAnd that is Egyptians' elevated expectations
p219
aVare placed first on themselves.
p220
aa(lp221
VIn the country once known for its passive resignation,
p222
aVwhere, as bad as things got,
p223
aVonly four percent expressed their opinion to a public official,
p224
aVtoday 90 percent tell us
p225
aVthat if there's a problem in their community,
p226
aVit's up to them to fix it.
p227
aV(Applause)
p228
aVAnd three-fourths
p229
aVbelieve they not only have the responsibility,
p230
aVbut the power to make change.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd this empowerment
p233
aValso applies to women,
p234
aVwhose role in the revolts
p235
aVcannot be underestimated.
p236
aVThey were doctors and dissidents,
p237
aVartists and organizers.
p238
aVA full third of those who braved tanks and tear gas
p239
aVto ask or to demand liberty and justice in Egypt
p240
aVwere women.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Applause)
p243
aa(lp244
VNow people have raised some real concerns
p245
aVabout what the rise of Islamist parties means for women.
p246
aVWhat we've found about the role of religion in law
p247
aVand the role of religion in society
p248
aVis that there's no female consensus.
p249
aVWe found that women in one country
p250
aVlook more like the men in that country
p251
aVthan their female counterparts across the border.
p252
aVNow what this suggests
p253
aVis that how women view religion's role in society
p254
aVis shaped more by their own country's culture and context
p255
aVthan one monolithic view
p256
aVthat religion is simply bad for women.
p257
aVWhere women agree, however,
p258
aVis on their own role,
p259
aVand that it must be central and active.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd here is where we see the greatest gender difference within a country \u2014
p262
aVon the issue of women's rights.
p263
aVNow how men feel about women's rights
p264
aVmatters to the future of this region.
p265
aVBecause we discovered a link
p266
aVbetween men's support for women's employment
p267
aVand how many women are actually employed
p268
aVin professional fields in that country.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo the question becomes,
p271
aVWhat drives men's support for women's rights?
p272
aVWhat about men's views of religion and law?
p273
aV[Does] a man's opinion
p274
aVof the role of religion in politics
p275
aVshape their view of women's rights?
p276
aVThe answer is no.
p277
aVWe found absolutely no correlation,
p278
aVno impact whatsoever,
p279
aVbetween these two variables.
p280
aVWhat drives men's support for women's employment
p281
aVis men's employment,
p282
aVtheir level of education
p283
aVas well as a high score
p284
aVon their country's U.N. Human Development Index.
p285
aVWhat this means
p286
aVis that human development,
p287
aVnot secularization,
p288
aVis what's key to women's empowerment
p289
aVin the transforming Middle East.
p290
aa(lp291
VAnd the transformation continues.
p292
aVFrom Wall Street to Mohammed Mahmoud Street,
p293
aVit has never been more important
p294
aVto understand the aspirations
p295
aVof ordinary people.
p296
