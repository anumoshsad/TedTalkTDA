VMy work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously,
p4
aVon a collective level.
p5
aVAnd what I mean by that, it's the behaviors
p6
aVthat we're in denial about,
p7
aVand the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness.
p8
aVAnd as individuals, we all do these things, all the time, everyday.
p9
aVIt's like when you're mean to your wife
p10
aVbecause you're mad at somebody else.
p11
aVOr when you drink a little too much at a party, just out of anxiety.
p12
aVOr when you overeat because your feelings are hurt, or whatever.
p13
aVAnd when we do these kind of things,
p14
aVwhen 300 million people do unconscious behaviors,
p15
aVthen it can add up to a catastrophic consequence
p16
aVthat nobody wants, and no one intended.
p17
aVAnd that's what I look at with my photographic work.
p18
aa(lp19
VThis is an image I just recently completed, that is \u2014
p20
aVwhen you stand back at a distance,
p21
aVit looks like some kind of neo-Gothic, cartoon image
p22
aVof a factory spewing out pollution.
p23
aVAnd as you get a little bit closer,
p24
aVit starts looking like lots of pipes, like maybe a chemical plant,
p25
aVor a refinery, or maybe a hellish freeway interchange.
p26
aVAnd as you get all the way up close,
p27
aVyou realize that it's actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups.
p28
aVAnd in fact, this is one million plastic cups,
p29
aVwhich is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights
p30
aVin the United States every six hours.
p31
aVWe use four million cups a day on airline flights,
p32
aVand virtually none of them are reused or recycled.
p33
aVThey just don't do that in that industry.
p34
aa(lp35
VNow, that number is dwarfed
p36
aVby the number of paper cups we use every day,
p37
aVand that is 40 million cups a day for hot beverages,
p38
aVmost of which is coffee.
p39
aVI couldn't fit 40 million cups on a canvas,
p40
aVbut I was able to put 410,000. That's what 410,000 cups looks like.
p41
aVThat's 15 minutes of our cup consumption.
p42
aVAnd if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life,
p43
aVthat's the size it would be.
p44
aVAnd there's an hour's worth of our cups.
p45
aVAnd there's a day's worth of our cups.
p46
aVYou can still see the little people way down there.
p47
aVThat's as high as a 42-story building,
p48
aVand I put the Statue of Liberty in there as a scale reference.
p49
aa(lp50
VSpeaking of justice, there's another phenomenon going on in our culture
p51
aVthat I find deeply troubling, and that is that America, right now,
p52
aVhas the largest percentage of its population in prison
p53
aVof any country on Earth.
p54
aVOne out of four people, one out of four humans in prison
p55
aVare Americans, imprisoned in our country.
p56
aVAnd I wanted to show the number.
p57
aVThe number is 2.3 million Americans were incarcerated in 2005.
p58
aVAnd that's gone up since then, but we don't have the numbers yet.
p59
aVSo, I wanted to show 2.3 million prison uniforms,
p60
aVand in the actual print of this piece,
p61
aVeach uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge.
p62
aVThey're tiny. They're barely visible as a piece of material,
p63
aVand to show 2.3 million of them required a canvas
p64
aVthat was larger than any printer in the world would print.
p65
aVAnd so I had to divide it up into multiple panels
p66
aVthat are 10 feet tall by 25 feet wide.
p67
aVThis is that piece installed in a gallery in New York \u2014
p68
aVthose are my parents looking at the piece.
p69
aV(Laughter)
p70
aVEvery time I look at this piece,
p71
aVI always wonder if my mom's whispering to my dad,
p72
aV"He finally folded his laundry."
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VI want to show you some pieces now that are about addiction.
p76
aVAnd this particular one is about cigarette addiction.
p77
aVI wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of Americans
p78
aVwho die from cigarette smoking.
p79
aVMore than 400,000 people die in the United States every year
p80
aVfrom smoking cigarettes.
p81
aVAnd so, this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes.
p82
aVAnd, as you slowly step back,
p83
aVyou see that it's a painting by Van Gogh, called "Skull with Cigarette."
p84
aVIt's a strange thing to think about, that on 9/11,
p85
aVwhen that tragedy happened, 3,000 Americans died.
p86
aVAnd do you remember the response?
p87
aVIt reverberated around the world,
p88
aVand will continue to reverberate through time.
p89
aVIt will be something that we talk about in 100 years.
p90
aVAnd yet on that same day, 1,100 Americans died from smoking.
p91
aVAnd the day after that, another 1,100 Americans died from smoking.
p92
aVAnd every single day since then, 1,100 Americans have died.
p93
aVAnd today, 1,100 Americans are dying from cigarette smoking.
p94
aVAnd we aren't talking about it \u2014 we dismiss it.
p95
aVThe tobacco lobby, it's too strong.
p96
aVWe just dismiss it out of our consciousness.
p97
aVAnd knowing what we know about the destructive power of cigarettes,
p98
aVwe continue to allow our children, our sons and daughters,
p99
aVto be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking.
p100
aVAnd this is what the next piece is about.
p101
aa(lp102
VThis is just lots and lots of cigarettes: 65,000 cigarettes,
p103
aVwhich is equal to the number of teenagers
p104
aVwho will start smoking this month, and every month in the U.S.
p105
aVMore than 700,000 children in the United States aged 18 and under
p106
aVbegin smoking every year.
p107
aa(lp108
VOne more strange epidemic in the United States
p109
aVthat I want to acquaint you with
p110
aVis this phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drugs.
p111
aVThis is an image I've made out of lots and lots of Vicodin.
p112
aVWell, actually, I only had one Vicodin
p113
aVthat I scanned lots and lots of times.
p114
aV(Laughter)
p115
aVAnd so, as you stand back, you see 213,000 Vicodin pills,
p116
aVwhich is the number of hospital emergency room visits
p117
aVyearly in the United States,
p118
aVattributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers
p119
aVand anti-anxiety medications.
p120
aVOne-third of all drug overdoses in the U.S. \u2014
p121
aVand that includes cocaine, heroin, alcohol, everything \u2014
p122
aVone-third of drug overdoses are prescription medications.
p123
aVA strange phenomenon.
p124
aa(lp125
VThis is a piece that I just recently completed
p126
aVabout another tragic phenomenon. And that is the phenomenon,
p127
aVthis growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery.
p128
aV384,000 women, American women, last year
p129
aVwent in for elective breast augmentation surgery.
p130
aVIt's rapidly becoming the most popular high school graduation gift,
p131
aVgiven to young girls who are about to go off to college.
p132
aVSo, I made this image out of Barbie dolls,
p133
aVand so, as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern,
p134
aVand as you get all the way back, you see 32,000 Barbie dolls,
p135
aVwhich represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries
p136
aVthat are performed in the U.S. each month.
p137
aVThe vast majority of those are on women under the age of 21.
p138
aVAnd strangely enough, the only plastic surgery
p139
aVthat is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction,
p140
aVand most of that is being done by men.
p141
aa(lp142
VNow, I want to emphasize that these are just examples.
p143
aVI'm not holding these out as being the biggest issues.
p144
aVThey're just examples.
p145
aVAnd the reason that I do this, it's because I have this fear
p146
aVthat we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now.
p147
aVThere's this kind of anesthesia in America at the moment.
p148
aVWe've lost our sense of outrage, our anger and our grief
p149
aVabout what's going on in our culture right now,
p150
aVwhat's going on in our country,
p151
aVthe atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world.
p152
aVThey've gone missing; these feelings have gone missing.
p153
aVOur cultural joy, our national joy is nowhere to be seen.
p154
aVAnd one of the causes of this, I think,
p155
aVis that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of worldview,
p156
aVthis holoptical worldview, this holographic image
p157
aVthat we're all trying to create in our mind
p158
aVof the interconnection of things: the environmental footprints
p159
aV1,000 miles away of the things that we buy;
p160
aVthe social consequences 10,000 miles away
p161
aVof the daily decisions that we make as consumers.
p162
aa(lp163
VAs we try to build this view,
p164
aVand try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture,
p165
aVthe information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers:
p166
aVnumbers in the millions, in the hundreds of millions,
p167
aVin the billions and now in the trillions.
p168
aVBush's new budget is in the trillions, and these are numbers
p169
aVthat our brain just doesn't have the ability to comprehend.
p170
aVWe can't make meaning out of these enormous statistics.
p171
aVAnd so that's what I'm trying to do with my work,
p172
aVis to take these numbers, these statistics
p173
aVfrom the raw language of data, and to translate them
p174
aVinto a more universal visual language, that can be felt.
p175
aVBecause my belief is, if we can feel these issues,
p176
aVif we can feel these things more deeply,
p177
aVthen they'll matter to us more than they do now.
p178
aVAnd if we can find that,
p179
aVthen we'll be able to find, within each one of us,
p180
aVwhat it is that we need to find to face the big question,
p181
aVwhich is: how do we change?
p182
aVThat, to me, is the big question that we face as a people right now:
p183
aVhow do we change? How do we change as a culture,
p184
aVand how do we each individually take responsibility
p185
aVfor the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of,
p186
aVand that is our own behavior?
p187
aa(lp188
VMy belief is that you don't have to make yourself bad
p189
aVto look at these issues.
p190
aVI'm not pointing the finger at America in a blaming way.
p191
aVI'm simply saying, this is who we are right now.
p192
aVAnd if there are things that we see
p193
aVthat we don't like about our culture,
p194
aVthen we have a choice.
p195
aVThe degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface,
p196
aVto bring to this question, the depth of character that we can summon,
p197
aVas we show up for the question of how do we change \u2014
p198
aVit's already defining us as individuals and as a nation,
p199
aVand it will continue to do that, on into the future.
p200
aVAnd it will profoundly affect the well-being, the quality of life
p201
aVof the billions of people
p202
aVwho are going to inherit the results of our decisions.
p203
aVI'm not speaking abstractly about this,
p204
aVI'm speaking \u2014 this is who we are in this room,
p205
aVright now, in this moment.
