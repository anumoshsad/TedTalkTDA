VI have the answer to a question that we've all asked.
p4
aVThe question is,
p5
aVWhy is it that the letter X
p6
aVrepresents the unknown?
p7
aVNow I know we learned that in math class,
p8
aVbut now it's everywhere in the culture \u2014
p9
aVThe X prize, the X-Files,
p10
aVProject X, TEDx.
p11
aVWhere'd that come from?
p12
aa(lp13
VAbout six years ago
p14
aVI decided that I would learn Arabic,
p15
aVwhich turns out to be a supremely logical language.
p16
aVTo write a word or a phrase
p17
aVor a sentence in Arabic
p18
aVis like crafting an equation,
p19
aVbecause every part is extremely precise
p20
aVand carries a lot of information.
p21
aVThat's one of the reasons
p22
aVso much of what we've come to think of
p23
aVas Western science and mathematics and engineering
p24
aVwas really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era
p25
aVby the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks.
p26
aa(lp27
VThis includes the little system in Arabic
p28
aVcalled al-jebra.
p29
aVAnd al-jebr roughly translates to
p30
aV"the system for reconciling disparate parts."
p31
aVAl-jebr finally came into English as algebra.
p32
aVOne example among many.
p33
aa(lp34
VThe Arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom
p35
aVfinally made their way to Europe \u2014
p36
aVwhich is to say Spain \u2014
p37
aVin the 11th and 12th centuries.
p38
aVAnd when they arrived
p39
aVthere was tremendous interest
p40
aVin translating this wisdom
p41
aVinto a European language.
p42
aa(lp43
VBut there were problems.
p44
aVOne problem
p45
aVis there are some sounds in Arabic
p46
aVthat just don't make it through a European voice box
p47
aVwithout lots of practice.
p48
aVTrust me on that one.
p49
aVAlso, those very sounds
p50
aVtend not to be represented
p51
aVby the characters that are available in European languages.
p52
aa(lp53
VHere's one of the culprits.
p54
aVThis is the letter SHeen,
p55
aVand it makes the sound we think of as SH \u2014 "sh."
p56
aVIt's also the very first letter
p57
aVof the word shalan,
p58
aVwhich means "something"
p59
aVjust like the the English word "something" \u2014
p60
aVsome undefined, unknown thing.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow in Arabic,
p63
aVwe can make this definite
p64
aVby adding the definite article "al."
p65
aVSo this is al-shalan \u2014
p66
aVthe unknown thing.
p67
aVAnd this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics,
p68
aVsuch as this 10th century derivation of proofs.
p69
aa(lp70
VThe problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars
p71
aVwho were tasked with translating this material
p72
aVis that the letter SHeen and the word shalan
p73
aVcan't be rendered into Spanish
p74
aVbecause Spanish doesn't have that SH,
p75
aVthat "sh" sound.
p76
aVSo by convention,
p77
aVthey created a rule in which
p78
aVthey borrowed the CK sound, "ck" sound,
p79
aVfrom the classical Greek
p80
aVin the form of the letter Kai.
p81
aa(lp82
VLater when this material was translated
p83
aVinto a common European language,
p84
aVwhich is to say Latin,
p85
aVthey simply replaced the Greek Kai
p86
aVwith the Latin X.
p87
aVAnd once that happened,
p88
aVonce this material was in Latin,
p89
aVit formed the basis for mathematics textbooks
p90
aVfor almost 600 years.
p91
aa(lp92
VBut now we have the answer to our question.
p93
aVWhy is it that X is the unknown?
p94
aVX is the unknown
p95
aVbecause you can't say "sh" in Spanish.
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVAnd I thought that was worth sharing.
