VSo I want to talk today about money and happiness,
p4
aVwhich are two things a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about,
p5
aVeither trying to earn them or trying to increase them.
p6
aVAnd a lot of us resonate with this phrase,
p7
aVwe see it in religions and self-help books:
p8
aVmoney can't buy happiness.
p9
aVAnd I want to suggest today that, in fact, that's wrong.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VI'm at a business school, so that's what we do.
p14
aVSo that's wrong,
p15
aVand in fact, if you think that, you're just not spending it right.
p16
aVSo instead of spending it the way you usually spend it,
p17
aVmaybe if you spent it differently, that might work a little bit better.
p18
aVBefore I tell you the ways you can spend it that will make you happier,
p19
aVlet's think about the ways we usually spend it
p20
aVthat don't, in fact, make us happier.
p21
aVWe had a little natural experiment.
p22
aVSo CNN, a little while ago, wrote this interesting article
p23
aVon what happens to people when they win the lottery.
p24
aVIt turns out people think when they win the lottery
p25
aVtheir lives will be amazing.
p26
aVThis article's about how their lives get ruined.
p27
aVWhat happens when people win the lottery
p28
aVis, one, they spend all the money and go into debt;
p29
aVand two, all of their friends and everyone they've ever met
p30
aVfind them and bug them for money.
p31
aVIt ruins their social relationships, in fact.
p32
aVSo they have more debt and worse friendships
p33
aVthan they had before they won the lottery.
p34
aa(lp35
VWhat was interesting about the article was,
p36
aVpeople started commenting on the article, readers of the thing.
p37
aVAnd instead of talking about how it made them realize
p38
aVthat money doesn't lead to happiness,
p39
aVeveryone started saying, "You know what I'd do if I won the lottery ...?"
p40
aVand fantasizing about what they'd do.
p41
aVHere's just two of the ones we saw that are interesting to think about.
p42
aVOne person wrote, "When I win, I'm going to buy my own little mountain
p43
aVand have a little house on top."
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd another person wrote, "I would fill a big bathtub with money
p48
aVand get in the tub while smoking a big fat cigar
p49
aVand sipping a glass of champagne."
p50
aVThis is even worse: "... then I'd have a picture taken
p51
aVand dozens of glossies made.
p52
aVAnyone begging for money or trying to extort from me
p53
aVwould receive a copy of the picture and nothing else."
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd so many of the comments were exactly of this type,
p58
aVwhere people got money and, in fact, it made them antisocial.
p59
aVSo I told you it ruins people's lives and their friends bug them.
p60
aVAlso, money often makes us feel very selfish
p61
aVand we do things only for ourselves.
p62
aVWe thought maybe the reason money doesn't make us happy
p63
aVis that we're spending it on the wrong things;
p64
aVin particular, we're always spending it on ourselves.
p65
aVAnd we wondered what would happen
p66
aVif we made people spend more of their money on others.
p67
aVSo instead of being antisocial with your money,
p68
aVwhat if you were more pro-social with it?
p69
aa(lp70
VWe thought, let's make people do it and see what happens.
p71
aVLet's have some people do what they usually do,
p72
aVspend money on themselves,
p73
aVand let's make some people give money away,
p74
aVand measure their happiness and see if, in fact, they get happier.
p75
aVThe first way we did this was, one Vancouver morning,
p76
aVwe went out on the campus at University of British Columbia,
p77
aVapproached people and said, "Do you want to be in an experiment?"
p78
aVThey said, "Yes."
p79
aVWe asked them how happy they were, and then gave them an envelope.
p80
aVOne of the envelopes had things in it that said,
p81
aV"By 5pm today, spend this money on yourself."
p82
aVWe gave some examples of what you could spend it on.
p83
aVOther people got a slip of paper that said,
p84
aV"By 5pm today, spend this money on somebody else."
p85
aVAlso inside the envelope was money.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd we manipulated how much money we gave them;
p88
aVsome people got this slip of paper and five dollars,
p89
aVsome got this slip of paper and 20 dollars.
p90
aVWe let them go about their day and do whatever they wanted.
p91
aVWe found out they did spend it in the way we asked them to.
p92
aVWe called them up and asked them, "What did you spend it on?
p93
aVHow happy do you feel now?"
p94
aVWhat did they spend it on?
p95
aVThese are college undergrads;
p96
aVa lot of what they spent it on for themselves
p97
aVwere things like earrings and makeup.
p98
aVOne woman said she bought a stuffed animal for her niece.
p99
aVPeople gave money to homeless people.
p100
aVHuge effect here of Starbucks.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VSo if you give undergraduates five dollars,
p105
aVit looks like coffee to them,
p106
aVand they run over to Starbucks and spend it as fast as they can.
p107
aVSome people bought coffee for themselves, the way they usually would,
p108
aVbut others bought coffee for somebody else.
p109
aVSo the very same purchase,
p110
aVjust targeted toward yourself or targeted toward somebody else.
p111
aVWhat did we find when we called at the end of the day?
p112
aVPeople who spent money on others got happier;
p113
aVpeople who spent it on themselves, nothing happened.
p114
aVIt didn't make them less happy, it just didn't do much for them.
p115
aa(lp116
VThe other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn't matter much.
p117
aVPeople thought 20 dollars would be way better than five.
p118
aVIn fact, it doesn't matter how much money you spent.
p119
aVWhat really matters is that you spent it on somebody else
p120
aVrather than on yourself.
p121
aVWe see this again and again
p122
aVwhen we give people money to spend on others instead of on themselves.
p123
aVOf course, these are undergraduates in Canada \u2014
p124
aVnot the world's most representative population.
p125
aVThey're also fairly wealthy and affluent and other sorts of things.
p126
aa(lp127
VWe wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world
p128
aVor just among wealthy countries.
p129
aVSo we went to Uganda and ran a very similar experiment.
p130
aVImagine, instead of just people in Canada, we say,
p131
aV"Name the last time you spent money on yourself or others.
p132
aVDescribe it. How happy did it make you?"
p133
aVOr in Uganda, "Name the last time you spent money on yourself or others
p134
aVand describe that."
p135
aVThen we asked them how happy they are, again.
p136
aVAnd what we see is sort of amazing,
p137
aVbecause there's human universals on what you do with your money,
p138
aVand real cultural differences on what you do as well.
p139
aVSo for example, one guy from Uganda says this:
p140
aV"I called a girl I wished to love."
p141
aVThey basically went out on a date,
p142
aVand he says at the end that he didn't "achieve" her up till now.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VHere's a guy from Canada.
p147
aVVery similar thing.
p148
aV"I took my girlfriend out for dinner.
p149
aVWe went to a movie, we left early,
p150
aVand then went back to her room for ... cake," just cake.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VHuman universal:
p155
aVyou spend money on others, you're being nice.
p156
aVMaybe you have something in mind, maybe not.
p157
aVBut then we see extraordinary differences.
p158
aVSo look at these two.
p159
aVThis is a woman from Canada.
p160
aVWe say, "Name a time you spent money on somebody else."
p161
aVShe says, "I bought a present for my mom.
p162
aVI drove to the mall, bought a present, gave it to my mom."
p163
aVPerfectly nice thing to do.
p164
aVIt's good to get gifts for people you know.
p165
aVCompare that to this woman from Uganda:
p166
aV"I was walking and met a longtime friend whose son was sick with malaria.
p167
aVThey had no money, they went to a clinic and I gave her this money."
p168
aVThis isn't $10,000, it's the local currency.
p169
aVSo it's a very small amount of money, in fact.
p170
aVBut enormously different motivations here.
p171
aVThis is a real medical need, literally a lifesaving donation.
p172
aVAbove, it's just kind of, I bought a gift for my mother.
p173
aa(lp174
VWhat we see again, though,
p175
aVis that the specific way you spend on other people isn't nearly as important
p176
aVas the fact that you spend on other people in order to make yourself happy,
p177
aVwhich is really quite important.
p178
aVSo you don't have to do amazing things with your money
p179
aVto make yourself happy.
p180
aVYou can do small, trivial things and still get the benefits from doing this.
p181
aVThese are only two countries.
p182
aVWe wanted to look at every country in the world if we could,
p183
aVto see what the relationship is between money and happiness.
p184
aa(lp185
VWe got data from the Gallup Organization,
p186
aVwhich you know from all the political polls happening lately.
p187
aVThey asked people, "Did you donate money to charity recently?"
p188
aVand, "How happy are you with life in general?"
p189
aVWe can see what the relationship is between those two things.
p190
aVAre they positively correlated, giving money makes you happy?
p191
aVOr are they negatively correlated?
p192
aVOn this map, green will mean they're positively correlated,
p193
aVred means they're negatively correlated.
p194
aVAnd you can see, the world is crazily green.
p195
aVSo in almost every country in the world where we have this data,
p196
aVpeople who give money to charity are happier people
p197
aVthan people who don't give money to charity.
p198
aVI know you're looking at the red country in the middle.
p199
aVI would be a jerk and not tell you what it is,
p200
aVbut it's Central African Republic.
p201
aVYou can make up stories.
p202
aVMaybe it's different there for some reason.
p203
aVJust below that to the right is Rwanda, though,
p204
aVwhich is amazingly green.
p205
aa(lp206
VSo almost everywhere we look,
p207
aVwe see that giving money away makes you happier
p208
aVthan keeping it for yourself.
p209
aVWhat about work, which is where we spend the rest of our time,
p210
aVwhen we're not with the people we know.
p211
aVWe decided to infiltrate some companies and do a very similar thing.
p212
aVThese are sales teams in Belgium.
p213
aVThey work in teams, go out and sell to doctors
p214
aVand try to get them to buy drugs.
p215
aVWe can look and see how well they sell things
p216
aVas a function of being a member of a team.
p217
aVWe give people on some teams some money
p218
aV"Spend it however you want on yourself,"
p219
aVjust like we did with the undergrads in Canada.
p220
aVTo other teams we say, "Here's 15 euro. Spend it on one of your teammates.
p221
aVBuy them something as a gift and give it to them.
p222
aVThen we can see, we've got teams that spend on themselves
p223
aVand these pro-social teams who we give money to make the team better.
p224
aVThe reason I have a ridiculous pinata there
p225
aVis one team pooled their money and bought a pinata,
p226
aVthey smashed the pinata, the candy fell out and things like that.
p227
aVA silly, trivial thing to do,
p228
aVbut think of the difference on a team that didn't do that at all,
p229
aVthat got 15 euro, put it in their pocket, maybe bought themselves a coffee,
p230
aVor teams that had this pro-social experience
p231
aVwhere they bonded together to buy something and do a group activity.
p232
aVWhat we see is that the teams that are pro-social sell more stuff
p233
aVthan the teams that only got money for themselves.
p234
aa(lp235
VOne way to think of it is: for every 15 euro you give people for themselves,
p236
aVthey put it in their pocket and don't do anything different than before.
p237
aVYou don't get money from that;
p238
aVyou lose money, since it doesn't motivate them to perform better.
p239
aVBut when you give them 15 euro to spend on their teammates,
p240
aVthey do so much better on their teams
p241
aVthat you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money.
p242
aa(lp243
VYou're probably thinking to yourselves, this is all fine,
p244
aVbut there's a context that's incredibly important for public policy,
p245
aVand I can't imagine it would work there.
p246
aVAnd if he doesn't show me that it works here,
p247
aVI don't believe anything he said.
p248
aVI know what you're all thinking about are dodgeball teams.
p249
aa(lp250
V(Laughter)
p251
aa(lp252
VThis was a huge criticism that we got,
p253
aVthat if you can't show it with dodgeball teams, this is all stupid.
p254
aVSo we went and found these dodgeball teams and infiltrated them,
p255
aVand did the exact same thing as before.
p256
aVSo we give people on some teams money to spend on themselves.
p257
aVOther teams, we give them money to spend on their dodgeball teammates.
p258
aVThe teams that spend money on themselves
p259
aVhave the same winning percentages as before.
p260
aVThe teams we give the money to spend on each other
p261
aVbecome different teams;
p262
aVthey dominate the league by the time they're done.
p263
aa(lp264
VAcross all of these different contexts \u2014
p265
aVyour personal life, you work life, even things like intramural sports \u2014
p266
aVwe see spending on other people has a bigger return for you
p267
aVthan spending on yourself.
p268
aVSo if you think money can't buy happiness, you're not spending it right.
p269
aVThe implication isn't you should buy this product instead of that product,
p270
aVand that's the way to make yourself happier.
p271
aVIt's that you should stop thinking about which product to buy for yourself,
p272
aVand try giving some of it to other people instead.
p273
aa(lp274
VAnd we luckily have an opportunity for you.
p275
aVDonorsChoose.org is a nonprofit for mainly public school teachers
p276
aVin low-income schools.
p277
aVThey post projects like,
p278
aV"I want to teach Huckleberry Finn and we don't have the books,"
p279
aVor, "I want a microscope to teach my students science
p280
aVand we don't have a microscope."
p281
aVYou and I can go on and buy it for them.
p282
aVThe teacher and the kids write you thank-you notes,
p283
aVsometimes they send pictures of them using the microscope.
p284
aVIt's an extraordinary thing.
p285
aa(lp286
VGo to the website and start yourself on the process of thinking
p287
aVless about "How can I spend money on myself?"
p288
aVand more about "If I've got five dollars or 15 dollars,
p289
aVwhat can I do to benefit other people?"
p290
aVUltimately, when you do that, you'll find you benefit yourself much more.
p291
aa(lp292
VThank you.
