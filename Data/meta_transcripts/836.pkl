VThe greatest irony in global health
p4
aVis that the poorest countries
p5
aVcarry the largest disease burden.
p6
aVIf we resize the countries of the globe
p7
aVin proportion to the subject of interest,
p8
aVwe see that Sub-Saharan Africa
p9
aVis the worst hit region by HIV/AIDS.
p10
aVThis is the most devastating epidemic of our time.
p11
aVWe also see that this region
p12
aVhas the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease.
p13
aVThere are very few doctors
p14
aVand, quite frankly, these countries do not have the resources
p15
aVthat are needed to cope
p16
aVwith such epidemics.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo what the Western countries,
p19
aVdeveloped countries, have generously done
p20
aVis they have proposed to provide free drugs
p21
aVto all people in Third World countries
p22
aVwho actually can't afford these medications.
p23
aVAnd this has already saved millions of lives,
p24
aVand it has prevented entire economies
p25
aVfrom capsizing in Sub-Saharan Africa.
p26
aa(lp27
VBut there is a fundamental problem
p28
aVthat is killing the efforts
p29
aVin fighting this disease,
p30
aVbecause if you keep throwing
p31
aVdrugs out at people
p32
aVwho don't have diagnostic services,
p33
aVyou end up creating a problem of drug resistance.
p34
aVThis is already beginning to happen in Sub-Saharan Africa.
p35
aVThe problem is that,
p36
aVwhat begins as a tragedy in the Third World
p37
aVcould easily become a global problem.
p38
aVAnd the last thing we want to see
p39
aVis drug-resistant strains of HIV
p40
aVpopping up all over the world,
p41
aVbecause it will make treatment more expensive
p42
aVand it could also restore
p43
aVthe pre-ARV carnage of HIV/AIDS.
p44
aa(lp45
VI experienced this firsthand
p46
aVas a high school student in Uganda.
p47
aVThis was in the 90s
p48
aVduring the peak of the HIV epidemic,
p49
aVbefore there were any ARVs in Sub-Saharan Africa.
p50
aVAnd during that time, I actually lost more relatives,
p51
aVas well as the teachers who taught me,
p52
aVto HIV/AIDS.
p53
aVSo this became one of the driving passions of my life,
p54
aVto help find real solutions
p55
aVthat could address these kinds of problems.
p56
aa(lp57
VWe all know about the miracle of miniaturization.
p58
aVBack in the day, computers used to fill this entire room,
p59
aVand people actually used to work inside the computers.
p60
aVBut what electronic miniaturization has done
p61
aVis that it has allowed people to shrink
p62
aVtechnology into a cell phone.
p63
aVAnd I'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones
p64
aVthat can actually be used in the remote areas of the world,
p65
aVin the Third World countries.
p66
aVThe good news is that the same technology
p67
aVthat allowed miniaturization of electronics
p68
aVis now allowing us to miniaturize
p69
aVbiological laboratories.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo, right now, we can actually miniaturize
p72
aVbiological and chemistry laboratories
p73
aVonto microfluidic chips.
p74
aVI was very lucky to come
p75
aVto the US right after high school,
p76
aVand was able to work on this technology
p77
aVand develop some devices.
p78
aVThis is a microfluidic chip that I developed.
p79
aVA close look at how the technology works:
p80
aVThese are channels that are about the size of a human hair \u2014
p81
aVso you have integrated valves, pumps, mixers and injectors \u2014
p82
aVso you can fit entire diagnostic experiments
p83
aVonto a microfluidic system.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo what I plan to do with this technology
p86
aVis to actually take the current state
p87
aVof the technology
p88
aVand build an HIV kit
p89
aVin a microfluidic system.
p90
aVSo, with one microfluidic chip,
p91
aVwhich is the size of an iPhone,
p92
aVyou can actually diagnose
p93
aV100 patients at the same time.
p94
aVFor each patient, we will be able to do
p95
aVup to 100 different viral loads per patient.
p96
aVAnd this is only done in four hours,
p97
aV50 times faster than the current state of the art,
p98
aVat a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper
p99
aVthan the current options.
p100
aVSo this will allow us to create
p101
aVpersonalized medicines in the Third World
p102
aVat a cost that is actually achievable
p103
aVand make the world a safer place.
p104
aa(lp105
VI invite your interest
p106
aVas well as your involvement
p107
aVin driving this vision
p108
aVto a point of practical reality.
p109
aa(lp110
