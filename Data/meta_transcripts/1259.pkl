VIs there anything unique about human beings?
p4
aVThere is.
p5
aVWe're the only creatures
p6
aVwith fully developed moral sentiments.
p7
aVWe're obsessed with morality as social creatures.
p8
aVWe need to know why people are doing what they're doing.
p9
aVAnd I personally am obsessed with morality.
p10
aVIt was all due to this woman,
p11
aVSister Mary Marastela,
p12
aValso known as my mom.
p13
aVAs an altar boy, I breathed in a lot of incense,
p14
aVand I learned to say phrases in Latin,
p15
aVbut I also had time to think
p16
aVabout whether my mother's top-down morality
p17
aVapplied to everybody.
p18
aVI saw that people who were religious and non-religious
p19
aVwere equally obsessed with morality.
p20
aVI thought, maybe there's some earthly basis
p21
aVfor moral decisions.
p22
aVBut I wanted to go further
p23
aVthan to say our brains make us moral.
p24
aVI want to know if there's a chemistry of morality.
p25
aVI want to know
p26
aVif there was a moral molecule.
p27
aa(lp28
VAfter 10 years of experiments,
p29
aVI found it.
p30
aVWould you like to see it? I brought some with me.
p31
aVThis little syringe
p32
aVcontains the moral molecule.
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVIt's called oxytocin.
p35
aVSo oxytocin is a simple and ancient molecule
p36
aVfound only in mammals.
p37
aVIn rodents, it was known
p38
aVto make mothers care for their offspring,
p39
aVand in some creatures,
p40
aVallowed for toleration of burrowmates.
p41
aVBut in humans, it was only known
p42
aVto facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women,
p43
aVand is released by both sexes during sex.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule.
p46
aVI did what most of us do \u2014 I tried it on some colleagues.
p47
aVOne of them told me,
p48
aV"Paul, that is the world's stupidist idea.
p49
aVIt is," he said, "only a female molecule.
p50
aVIt can't be that important."
p51
aVBut I countered, "Well men's brains make this too.
p52
aVThere must be a reason why."
p53
aVBut he was right, it was a stupid idea.
p54
aVBut it was testably stupid.
p55
aVIn other words, I thought I could design an experiment
p56
aVto see if oxytocin made people moral.
p57
aa(lp58
VTurns out it wasn't so easy.
p59
aVFirst of all, oxytocin is a shy molecule.
p60
aVBaseline levels are near zero,
p61
aVwithout some stimulus to cause its release.
p62
aVAnd when it's produced, it has a three-minute half-life,
p63
aVand degrades rapidly at room temperature.
p64
aVSo this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin,
p65
aVhave to grab it fast and keep it cold.
p66
aVI think I can do that.
p67
aVNow luckily, oxytocin is produced
p68
aVboth in the brain and in the blood,
p69
aVso I could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery.
p70
aVThen I had to measure morality.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo taking on Morality with a capital M is a huge project.
p73
aVSo I started smaller.
p74
aVI studied one single virtue:
p75
aVtrustworthiness.
p76
aVWhy? I had shown in the early 2000s
p77
aVthat countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people
p78
aVare more prosperous.
p79
aVSo in these countries, more economic transactions occur
p80
aVand more wealth is created,
p81
aValleviating poverty.
p82
aVSo poor countries are by and large low trust countries.
p83
aVSo if I understood the chemistry of trustworthiness,
p84
aVI might help alleviate poverty.
p85
aa(lp86
VBut I'm also a skeptic.
p87
aVI don't want to just ask people, "Are you trustworthy?"
p88
aVSo instead I use
p89
aVthe Jerry Maguire approach to research.
p90
aVIf you're so virtuous,
p91
aVshow me the money.
p92
aVSo what we do in my lab
p93
aVis we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money.
p94
aVLet me show you how we do that.
p95
aVSo we recruit some people for an experiment.
p96
aVThey all get $10 if they agree to show up.
p97
aVWe give them lots of instruction, and we never ever deceive them.
p98
aVThen we match them in pairs by computer.
p99
aVAnd in that pair, one person gets a message saying,
p100
aV"Do you want to give up some of your $10
p101
aVyou earned for being here
p102
aVand ship it to someone else in the lab?"
p103
aVThe trick is you can't see them,
p104
aVyou can't talk to them.
p105
aVYou only do it one time.
p106
aVNow whatever you give up
p107
aVgets tripled in the other person's account.
p108
aVYou're going to make them a lot wealthier.
p109
aVAnd they get a message by computer saying
p110
aVperson one sent you this amount of money.
p111
aVDo you want to keep it all,
p112
aVor do you want to send some amount back?
p113
aa(lp114
VSo think about this experiment for minute.
p115
aVYou're going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half.
p116
aVSome mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle
p117
aVand take four tubes of blood.
p118
aVAnd now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger?
p119
aVSo this was the birth of vampire economics.
p120
aVMake a decision and give me some blood.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo in fact, experimental economists
p123
aVhad run this test around the world,
p124
aVand for much higher stakes,
p125
aVand the consensus view
p126
aVwas that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust,
p127
aVand the transfer from the second person back to the first
p128
aVmeasured trustworthiness.
p129
aVBut in fact, economists were flummoxed
p130
aVon why the second person would ever return any money.
p131
aVThey assumed money is good,
p132
aVwhy not keep it all?
p133
aa(lp134
VThat's not what we found.
p135
aVWe found 90 percent of the first decision-makers sent money,
p136
aVand of those who received money,
p137
aV95 percent returned some of it.
p138
aVBut why?
p139
aVWell by measuring oxytocin
p140
aVwe found that the more money the second person received,
p141
aVthe more their brain produced oxytocin,
p142
aVand the more oxytocin on board,
p143
aVthe more money they returned.
p144
aVSo we have a biology of trustworthiness.
p145
aa(lp146
VBut wait. What's wrong with this experiment?
p147
aVTwo things.
p148
aVOne is that nothing in the body happens in isolation.
p149
aVSo we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin,
p150
aVbut they didn't have any effect.
p151
aVBut the second is
p152
aVthat I still only had this indirect relationship
p153
aVbetween oxytocin and trustworthiness.
p154
aVI didn't know for sure
p155
aVoxytocin caused trustworthiness.
p156
aVSo to make the experiment,
p157
aVI knew I'd have to go into the brain
p158
aVand manipulate oxytocin directly.
p159
aVI used everything short of a drill
p160
aVto get oxytocin into my own brain.
p161
aVAnd I found I could do it
p162
aVwith a nasal inhaler.
p163
aVSo along with colleagues in Zurich,
p164
aVwe put 200 men on oxytocin or placebo,
p165
aVhad that same trust test with money,
p166
aVand we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust,
p167
aVwe can more than double the number of people
p168
aVwho sent all their money to a stranger \u2014
p169
aVall without altering mood or cognition.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo oxytocin is the trust molecule,
p172
aVbut is it the moral molecule?
p173
aVUsing the oxytocin inhaler,
p174
aVwe ran more studies.
p175
aVWe showed that oxytocin infusion
p176
aVincreases generosity
p177
aVin unilateral monetary transfers
p178
aVby 80 percent.
p179
aVWe showed it increases donations to charity
p180
aVby 50 percent.
p181
aVWe've also investigated
p182
aVnon-pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin.
p183
aVThese include massage,
p184
aVdancing and praying.
p185
aVYes, my mom was happy about that last one.
p186
aVAnd whenever we raise oxytocin,
p187
aVpeople willingly open up their wallets
p188
aVand share money with strangers.
p189
aa(lp190
VBut why do they do this?
p191
aVWhat does it feel like
p192
aVwhen your brain is flooded with oxytocin?
p193
aVTo investigate this question, we ran an experiment
p194
aVwhere we had people watch a video
p195
aVof a father and his four year-old son,
p196
aVand his son has terminal brain cancer.
p197
aVAfter they watched the video, we had them rate their feelings
p198
aVand took blood before and after to measure oxytocin.
p199
aVThe change in oxytocin
p200
aVpredicted their feelings of empathy.
p201
aVSo it's empathy
p202
aVthat makes us connect to other people.
p203
aVIt's empathy that makes us help other people.
p204
aVIt's empathy that makes us moral.
p205
aa(lp206
VNow this idea is not new.
p207
aVA then unknown philosopher named Adam Smith
p208
aVwrote a book in 1759
p209
aVcalled "The Theory of Moral Sentiments."
p210
aVIn this book, Smith argued
p211
aVthat we are moral creatures, not because of a top-down reason,
p212
aVbut for a bottom-up reason.
p213
aVHe said we're social creatures,
p214
aVso we share the emotions of others.
p215
aVSo if I do something that hurts you, I feel that pain.
p216
aVSo I tend to avoid that.
p217
aVIf I do something that makes you happy, I get to share your joy.
p218
aVSo I tend to do those things.
p219
aVNow this is the same Adam Smith who, 17 years later,
p220
aVwould write a little book called "The Wealth of Nations" \u2014
p221
aVthe founding document of economics.
p222
aVBut he was, in fact, a moral philosopher,
p223
aVand he was right on why we're moral.
p224
aVI just found the molecule behind it.
p225
aVBut knowing that molecule is valuable,
p226
aVbecause it tells us how to turn up this behavior
p227
aVand what turns it off.
p228
aVIn particular, it tells us
p229
aVwhy we see immorality.
p230
aa(lp231
VSo to investigate immorality,
p232
aVlet me bring you back now to 1980.
p233
aVI'm working at a gas station
p234
aVon the outskirts of Santa Barbara, California.
p235
aVYou sit in a gas station all day,
p236
aVyou see lots of morality and immorality, let me tell you.
p237
aVSo one Sunday afternoon, a man walks into my cashier's booth
p238
aVwith this beautiful jewelry box.
p239
aVOpens it up and there's a pearl necklace inside.
p240
aVAnd he said, "Hey, I was in the men's room.
p241
aVI just found this. What do you think we should do with it?"
p242
aV"I don't know, put it in the lost and found."
p243
aV"Well this is very valuable.
p244
aVWe have to find the owner for this." I said, "Yea."
p245
aa(lp246
VSo we're trying to decide what to do with this,
p247
aVand the phone rings.
p248
aVAnd a man says very excitedly,
p249
aV"I was in your gas station a while ago,
p250
aVand I bought this jewelry for my wife, and I can't find it."
p251
aVI said, "Pearl necklace?" "Yeah."
p252
aV"Hey, a guy just found it."
p253
aV"Oh, you're saving my life. Here's my phone number.
p254
aVTell that guy to wait half an hour.
p255
aVI'll be there and I'll give him a $200 reward."
p256
aVGreat, so I tell the guy, "Look, relax.
p257
aVGet yourself a fat reward. Life's good."
p258
aVHe said, "I can't do it.
p259
aVI have this job interview in Galena in 15 minutes,
p260
aVand I need this job, I've got to go."
p261
aVAgain he asked me, "What do you think we should do?"
p262
aVI'm in high school. I have no idea.
p263
aVSo I said, "I'll hold it for you."
p264
aVHe said, "You know, you've been so nice, let's split the reward."
p265
aVI'll give you the jewelry, you give me a hundred dollars,
p266
aVand when the guy comes ... "
p267
aa(lp268
VYou see it. I was conned.
p269
aVSo this is a classic con called the pigeon drop,
p270
aVand I was the pigeon.
p271
aVSo the way many cons work
p272
aVis not that the conman gets the victim to trust him,
p273
aVit's that he shows he trusts the victim.
p274
aVNow we know what happens.
p275
aVThe victim's brain releases oxytocin,
p276
aVand you're opening up your wallet or purse, giving away the money.
p277
aa(lp278
VSo who are these people
p279
aVwho manipulate our oxytocin systems?
p280
aVWe found, testing thousands of individuals,
p281
aVthat five percent of the population
p282
aVdon't release oxytocin on stimulus.
p283
aVSo if you trust them, their brains don't release oxytocin.
p284
aVIf there's money on the table, they keep it all.
p285
aVSo there's a technical word for these people in my lab.
p286
aVWe call them bastards.
p287
aV(Laughter)
p288
aVThese are not people you want to have a beer with.
p289
aVThey have many of the attributes of psychopaths.
p290
aa(lp291
VNow there are other ways the system can be inhibited.
p292
aVOne is through improper nurturing.
p293
aVSo we've studied sexually abused women,
p294
aVand about half those don't release oxytocin on stimulus.
p295
aVYou need enough nurturing
p296
aVfor this system to develop properly.
p297
aVAlso, high stress inhibits oxytocin.
p298
aVSo we all know this, when we're really stressed out,
p299
aVwe're not acting our best.
p300
aa(lp301
VThere's another way oxytocin is inhibited, which is interesting \u2014
p302
aVthrough the action of testosterone.
p303
aVSo we, in experiments, have administered testosterone to men.
p304
aVAnd instead of sharing money,
p305
aVthey become selfish.
p306
aVBut interestingly,
p307
aVhigh testosterone males are also more likely
p308
aVto use their own money to punish others for being selfish.
p309
aV(Laughter)
p310
aVNow think about this. It means, within our own biology,
p311
aVwe have the yin and yang of morality.
p312
aVWe have oxytocin that connects us to others,
p313
aVmakes us feel what they feel.
p314
aVAnd we have testosterone.
p315
aVAnd men have 10 times the testosterone as women,
p316
aVso men do this more than women \u2014
p317
aVwe have testosterone that makes us want to punish
p318
aVpeople who behave immorally.
p319
aVWe don't need God or government telling us what to do.
p320
aVIt's all inside of us.
p321
aa(lp322
VSo you may be wondering:
p323
aVthese are beautiful laboratory experiments,
p324
aVdo they really apply to real life?
p325
aVYeah, I've been worrying about that too.
p326
aVSo I've gone out of the lab
p327
aVto see if this really holds in our daily lives.
p328
aVSo last summer, I attended a wedding in Southern England.
p329
aV200 people in this beautiful Victorian mansion.
p330
aVI didn't know a single person.
p331
aVAnd I drove up in my rented Vauxhall.
p332
aVAnd I took out a centrifuge and dry ice
p333
aVand needles and tubes.
p334
aVAnd I took blood from the bride and the groom
p335
aVand the wedding party and the family and the friends
p336
aVbefore and immediately after the vows.
p337
aa(lp338
V(Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
VAnd guess what?
p341
aVWeddings cause a release of oxytocin,
p342
aVbut they do so in a very particular way.
p343
aVWho is the center of the wedding solar system?
p344
aVThe bride.
p345
aVShe had the biggest increase in oxytocin.
p346
aVWho loves the wedding almost as much as the bride?
p347
aVHer mother, that's right.
p348
aVHer mother was number two.
p349
aVThen the groom's father, then the groom,
p350
aVthen the family, then the friends \u2014
p351
aVarrayed around the bride
p352
aVlike planets around the Sun.
p353
aVSo I think it tells us that we've designed this ritual
p354
aVto connect us to this new couple,
p355
aVconnect us emotionally.
p356
aVWhy? Because we need them to be successful at reproducing
p357
aVto perpetuate the species.
p358
aa(lp359
VI also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money
p360
aVdidn't really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers.
p361
aVSo even though I have a fear of heights,
p362
aVI recently strapped myself to another human being
p363
aVand stepped out of an airplane at 12,000 ft.
p364
aVI took my blood before and after,
p365
aVand I had a huge spike of oxytocin.
p366
aVAnd there are so many ways we can connect to people.
p367
aVFor example, through social media.
p368
aVMany people are Tweeting right now.
p369
aVSo we investigated the role of social media
p370
aVand found the using social media
p371
aVproduced a solid double-digit increase in oxytocin.
p372
aa(lp373
VSo I ran this experiment recently for the Korean Broadcasting System.
p374
aVAnd they had the reporters and their producers participate.
p375
aVAnd one of these guys, he must have been 22,
p376
aVhe had 150 percent spike in oxytocin.
p377
aVI mean, astounding; no one has this.
p378
aVSo he was using social media in private.
p379
aVWhen I wrote my report to the Koreans,
p380
aVI said, "Look, I don't know what this guy was doing,"
p381
aVbut my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend.
p382
aVThey checked.
p383
aVHe was interacting on his girlfriend's Facebook page.
p384
aVThere you go. That's connection.
p385
aVSo there's tons of ways that we can connect to other people,
p386
aVand it seems to be universal.
p387
aa(lp388
VTwo weeks ago,
p389
aVI just got back from Papua New Guinea
p390
aVwhere I went up to the highlands \u2014
p391
aVvery isolated tribes of subsistence farmers
p392
aVliving as they have lived for millenia.
p393
aVThere are 800 different languages in the highlands.
p394
aVThese are the most primitive people in the world.
p395
aVAnd they indeed also release oxytocin.
p396
aa(lp397
VSo oxytocin connects us to other people.
p398
aVOxytocin makes us feel what other people feel.
p399
aVAnd it's so easy to cause people's brains
p400
aVto release oxytocin.
p401
aVI know how to do it,
p402
aVand my favorite way to do it is, in fact, the easiest.
p403
aVLet me show it to you.
p404
aVCome here. Give me a hug.
p405
aV(Laughter)
p406
aVThere you go.
p407
aa(lp408
V(Applause)
p409
aa(lp410
VSo my penchant for hugging other people
p411
aVhas earned me the nickname Dr. Love.
p412
aVI'm happy to share a little more love in the world,
p413
aVit's great,
p414
aVbut here's your prescription from Dr. Love:
p415
aVeight hugs a day.
p416
aVWe have found that people who release more oxytocin
p417
aVare happier.
p418
aVAnd they're happier
p419
aVbecause they have better relationships of all types.
p420
aVDr. Love says eight hugs a day.
p421
aVEight hugs a day \u2014 you'll be happier
p422
aVand the world will be a better place.
p423
aVOf course, if you don't like to touch people, I can always shove this up your nose.
p424
aa(lp425
V(Laughter)
p426
aa(lp427
