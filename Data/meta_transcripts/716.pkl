VMetaphor lives a secret life all around us.
p4
aVWe utter about six metaphors a minute.
p5
aVMetaphorical thinking is essential
p6
aVto how we understand ourselves and others,
p7
aVhow we communicate, learn, discover
p8
aVand invent.
p9
aVBut metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words.
p10
aa(lp11
VNow, to assist me in explaining this,
p12
aVI've enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers,
p13
aVthe reigning king of the metaphorians,
p14
aVa man whose contributions to the field
p15
aVare so great that he himself
p16
aVhas become a metaphor.
p17
aVI am, of course, referring to none other
p18
aVthan Elvis Presley.
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VNow, "All Shook Up" is a great love song.
p22
aVIt's also a great example of how
p23
aVwhenever we deal with anything abstract \u2014
p24
aVideas, emotions, feelings, concepts, thoughts \u2014
p25
aVwe inevitably resort to metaphor.
p26
aVIn "All Shook Up," a touch is not a touch, but a chill.
p27
aVLips are not lips, but volcanoes.
p28
aVShe is not she, but a buttercup.
p29
aVAnd love is not love, but being all shook up.
p30
aa(lp31
VIn this, Elvis is following Aristotle's classic definition of metaphor
p32
aVas the process of giving the thing
p33
aVa name that belongs to something else.
p34
aVThis is the mathematics of metaphor.
p35
aVAnd fortunately it's very simple.
p36
aVX equals Y.
p37
aV(Laughter)
p38
aVThis formula works wherever metaphor is present.
p39
aa(lp40
VElvis uses it, but so does Shakespeare
p41
aVin this famous line from "Romeo and Juliet:"
p42
aVJuliet is the sun.
p43
aVNow, here, Shakespeare gives the thing, Juliet,
p44
aVa name that belongs to something else, the sun.
p45
aVBut whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else,
p46
aVwe give it a whole network of analogies too.
p47
aVWe mix and match what we know about the metaphor's source,
p48
aVin this case the sun,
p49
aVwith what we know about its target, Juliet.
p50
aVAnd metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of Juliet
p51
aVthan if Shakespeare had literally described what she looks like.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo, how do we make and understand metaphors?
p54
aVThis might look familiar.
p55
aVThe first step is pattern recognition.
p56
aVLook at this image. What do you see?
p57
aVThree wayward Pac-Men,
p58
aVand three pointy brackets are actually present.
p59
aVWhat we see, however,
p60
aVare two overlapping triangles.
p61
aVMetaphor is not just the detection of patterns;
p62
aVit is the creation of patterns.
p63
aVSecond step, conceptual synesthesia.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow, synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ
p66
aVin another sense organ as well,
p67
aVsuch as colored hearing.
p68
aVPeople with colored hearing
p69
aVactually see colors when they hear the sounds
p70
aVof words or letters.
p71
aVWe all have synesthetic abilities.
p72
aVThis is the Bouba/Kiki test.
p73
aVWhat you have to do is identify which of these shapes
p74
aVis called Bouba, and which is called Kiki.
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VIf you are like 98 percent of other people,
p78
aVyou will identify the round, amoeboid shape as Bouba,
p79
aVand the sharp, spiky one as Kiki.
p80
aVCan we do a quick show of hands?
p81
aVDoes that correspond?
p82
aVOkay, I think 99.9 would about cover it.
p83
aVWhy do we do that?
p84
aVBecause we instinctively find, or create,
p85
aVa pattern between the round shape
p86
aVand the round sound of Bouba,
p87
aVand the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic.
p90
aVSilence is sweet.
p91
aVNeckties are loud.
p92
aVSexually attractive people are hot.
p93
aVSexually unattractive people leave us cold.
p94
aVMetaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia,
p95
aVin which we understand one concept
p96
aVin the context of another.
p97
aa(lp98
VThird step is cognitive dissonance.
p99
aVThis is the Stroop test.
p100
aVWhat you need to do here is identify
p101
aVas quickly as possible
p102
aVthe color of the ink in which these words are printed.
p103
aVYou can take the test now.
p104
aVIf you're like most people, you will experience
p105
aVa moment of cognitive dissonance
p106
aVwhen the name of the color
p107
aVis printed in a differently colored ink.
p108
aVThe test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words
p109
aVeven when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer.
p110
aa(lp111
VStroop tests have been done with metaphor as well.
p112
aVThe participants had to identify, as quickly as possible,
p113
aVthe literally false sentences.
p114
aVThey took longer to reject metaphors as false
p115
aVthan they did to reject literally false sentences.
p116
aVWhy? Because we cannot ignore
p117
aVthe metaphorical meaning of words either.
p118
aa(lp119
VOne of the sentences was, "Some jobs are jails."
p120
aVNow, unless you're a prison guard,
p121
aVthe sentence "Some jobs are jails" is literally false.
p122
aVSadly, it's metaphorically true.
p123
aVAnd the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability
p124
aVto identify it as literally false.
p125
aVMetaphor matters because
p126
aVit's around us every day, all the time.
p127
aVMetaphor matters because it creates expectations.
p128
aa(lp129
VPay careful attention the next time you read the financial news.
p130
aVAgent metaphors describe price movements
p131
aVas the deliberate action of a living thing,
p132
aVas in, "The NASDAQ climbed higher."
p133
aVObject metaphors describe price movements
p134
aVas non-living things,
p135
aVas in, "The Dow fell like a brick."
p136
aa(lp137
VResearchers asked a group of people
p138
aVto read a clutch of market commentaries,
p139
aVand then predict the next day's price trend.
p140
aVThose exposed to agent metaphors
p141
aVhad higher expectations that price trends would continue.
p142
aVAnd they had those expectations because
p143
aVagent metaphors imply the deliberate action
p144
aVof a living thing pursuing a goal.
p145
aVIf, for example, house prices
p146
aVare routinely described as climbing and climbing,
p147
aVhigher and higher, people might naturally assume
p148
aVthat that rise is unstoppable.
p149
aVThey may feel confident, say,
p150
aVin taking out mortgages they really can't afford.
p151
aVThat's a hypothetical example of course.
p152
aVBut this is how metaphor misleads.
p153
aa(lp154
VMetaphor also matters because it influences decisions
p155
aVby activating analogies.
p156
aVA group of students was told that a small democratic country
p157
aVhad been invaded and had asked the U.S. for help.
p158
aVAnd they had to make a decision.
p159
aVWhat should they do?
p160
aVIntervene, appeal to the U.N., or do nothing?
p161
aVThey were each then given one of three
p162
aVdescriptions of this hypothetical crisis.
p163
aVEach of which was designed to trigger
p164
aVa different historical analogy:
p165
aVWorld War II, Vietnam,
p166
aVand the third was historically neutral.
p167
aa(lp168
VThose exposed to the World War II scenario
p169
aVmade more interventionist recommendations
p170
aVthan the others.
p171
aVJust as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words,
p172
aVwe cannot ignore the analogies
p173
aVthat are triggered by metaphor.
p174
aVMetaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery.
p175
aVWhenever we solve a problem, or make a discovery,
p176
aVwe compare what we know with what we don't know.
p177
aVAnd the only way to find out about the latter
p178
aVis to investigate the ways it might be like the former.
p179
aa(lp180
VEinstein described his scientific method as combinatory play.
p181
aVHe famously used thought experiments,
p182
aVwhich are essentially elaborate analogies,
p183
aVto come up with some of his greatest discoveries.
p184
aVBy bringing together what we know
p185
aVand what we don't know through analogy,
p186
aVmetaphorical thinking strikes the spark
p187
aVthat ignites discovery.
p188
aa(lp189
VNow metaphor is ubiquitous, yet it's hidden.
p190
aVBut you just have to look at the words around you
p191
aVand you'll find it.
p192
aVRalph Waldo Emerson described language
p193
aVas "fossil poetry."
p194
aVBut before it was fossil poetry
p195
aVlanguage was fossil metaphor.
p196
aVAnd these fossils still breathe.
p197
aa(lp198
VTake the three most famous words in all of Western philosophy:
p199
aV"Cogito ergo sum."
p200
aVThat's routinely translated as, "I think, therefore I am."
p201
aVBut there is a better translation.
p202
aVThe Latin word "cogito"
p203
aVis derived from the prefix "co," meaning "together,"
p204
aVand the verb "agitare," meaning "to shake."
p205
aVSo, the original meaning of "cogito"
p206
aVis to shake together.
p207
aVAnd the proper translation of "cogito ergo sum"
p208
aVis "I shake things up, therefore I am."
p209
aV(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VMetaphor shakes things up,
p212
aVgiving us everything from Shakespeare to scientific discovery in the process.
p213
aVThe mind is a plastic snow dome,
p214
aVthe most beautiful, most interesting,
p215
aVand most itself, when, as Elvis put it,
p216
aVit's all shook up.
p217
aVAnd metaphor keeps the mind shaking,
p218
aVrattling and rolling, long after Elvis has left the building.
p219
aVThank you very much.
