VI just heard the best joke about Bond Emeruwa.
p4
aVI was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago,
p5
aVand a Nigerian journalist comes \u2014 and this will only make sense
p6
aVif you've ever watched a James Bond movie \u2014
p7
aVand a Nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes,
p8
aV"Aha, we meet again, Mr. Bond!"
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aVIt was great.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo, I've got a little sheet of paper here,
p13
aVmostly because I'm Nigerian and if you leave me alone,
p14
aVI'll talk for like two hours.
p15
aa(lp16
VI just want to say good afternoon, good evening.
p17
aVIt's been an incredible few days.
p18
aVIt's downhill from now on. I wanted to thank Emeka and Chris.
p19
aVBut also, most importantly, all the invisible people behind TED
p20
aVthat you just see flitting around the whole place
p21
aVthat have made sort of this space for such a diverse and robust conversation.
p22
aVIt's really amazing.
p23
aVI've been in the audience.
p24
aVI'm a writer, and I've been watching people with the slide shows
p25
aVand scientists and bankers, and I've been feeling a bit
p26
aVlike a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aVLike, what have I got to say about all this?
p29
aVAnd I was watching Jane [Goodall] yesterday,
p30
aVand I thought it was really great, and I was watching
p31
aVthose incredible slides of the chimpanzees, and I thought,
p32
aV"Wow. What if a chimpanzee could talk, you know? What would it say?"
p33
aVMy first thought was, "Well, you know, there's George Bush."
p34
aVBut then I thought, "Why be rude to chimpanzees?"
p35
aVI guess there goes my green card.
p36
aV(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VThere's been a lot of talk about narrative in Africa.
p39
aVAnd what's become increasingly clear to me is that
p40
aVwe're talking about news stories about Africa;
p41
aVwe're not really talking about African narratives.
p42
aVAnd it's important to make a distinction, because if the news is anything to go by,
p43
aV40 percent of Americans can't \u2014 either can't afford health insurance
p44
aVor have the most inadequate health insurance,
p45
aVand have a president who, despite the protest
p46
aVof millions of his citizens \u2014 even his own Congress \u2014
p47
aVcontinues to prosecute a senseless war.
p48
aVSo if news is anything to go by,
p49
aVthe U.S. is right there with Zimbabwe, right?
p50
aVWhich it isn't really, is it?
p51
aVAnd talking about war, my girlfriend has this great t-shirt
p52
aVthat says, "Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity."
p53
aVIt's amazing, isn't it?
p54
aa(lp55
VThe truth is, everything we know about America,
p56
aVeverything Americans come to know about being American,
p57
aVisn't from the news.
p58
aVI live there.
p59
aVWe don't go home at the end of the day and think,
p60
aV"Well, I really know who I am now
p61
aVbecause the Wall Street Journal says that the Stock Exchange
p62
aVclosed at this many points."
p63
aVWhat we know about how to be who we are comes from stories.
p64
aVIt comes from the novels, the movies, the fashion magazines.
p65
aVIt comes from popular culture.
p66
aa(lp67
VIn other words, it's the agents of our imagination
p68
aVwho really shape who we are. And this is important to remember,
p69
aVbecause in Africa
p70
aVthe complicated questions we want to ask about
p71
aVwhat all of this means has been asked
p72
aVfrom the rock paintings of the San people,
p73
aVthrough the Sundiata epics of Mali, to modern contemporary literature.
p74
aVIf you want to know about Africa, read our literature \u2014
p75
aVand not just "Things Fall Apart," because that would be like saying,
p76
aV"I've read 'Gone with the Wind' and so I know everything about America."
p77
aVThat's very important.
p78
aVThere's a poem by Jack Gilbert called "The Forgotten Dialect of the Heart."
p79
aVHe says, "When the Sumerian tablets were first translated,
p80
aVthey were thought to be business records.
p81
aVBut what if they were poems and psalms?
p82
aVMy love is like twelve Ethiopian goats
p83
aVstanding still in the morning light.
p84
aVShiploads of thuja are what my body wants to say to your body.
p85
aVGiraffes are this desire in the dark."
p86
aVThis is important.
p87
aa(lp88
VIt's important because misreading is really the chance
p89
aVfor complication and opportunity.
p90
aVThe first Igbo Bible was translated from English
p91
aVin about the 1800s by Bishop Crowther,
p92
aVwho was a Yoruba.
p93
aVAnd it's important to know Igbo is a tonal language,
p94
aVand so they'll say the word "igwe" and "igwe":
p95
aVsame spelling, one means "sky" or "heaven,"
p96
aVand one means "bicycle" or "iron."
p97
aVSo "God is in heaven surrounded by His angels"
p98
aVwas translated as \u2014
p99
aV[Igbo].
p100
aVAnd for some reason, in Cameroon, when they tried
p101
aVto translate the Bible into Cameroonian patois,
p102
aVthey chose the Igbo version.
p103
aVAnd I'm not going to give you the patois translation;
p104
aVI'm going to make it standard English.
p105
aVBasically, it ends up as "God is on a bicycle with his angels."
p106
aVThis is good, because language complicates things.
p107
aa(lp108
VYou know, we often think that language mirrors
p109
aVthe world in which we live, and I find that's not true.
p110
aVThe language actually makes the world in which we live.
p111
aVLanguage is not \u2014 I mean, things don't have
p112
aVany mutable value by themselves; we ascribe them a value.
p113
aVAnd language can't be understood in its abstraction.
p114
aVIt can only be understood in the context of story,
p115
aVand everything, all of this is story.
p116
aVAnd it's important to remember that,
p117
aVbecause if we don't, then we become ahistorical.
p118
aVWe've had a lot of \u2014 a parade of amazing ideas here.
p119
aVBut these are not new to Africa.
p120
aVNigeria got its independence in 1960.
p121
aVThe first time the possibility for independence was discussed
p122
aVwas in 1922, following the Aba women's market riots.
p123
aVIn 1967, in the middle of the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War,
p124
aVDr. Njoku-Obi invented the Cholera vaccine.
p125
aVSo, you know, the thing is to remember that
p126
aVbecause otherwise, 10 years from now,
p127
aVwe'll be back here trying to tell this story again.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo, what it says to me then is that it's not really \u2014
p130
aVthe problem isn't really the stories that are being told
p131
aVor which stories are being told,
p132
aVthe problem really is the terms of humanity
p133
aVthat we're willing to bring to complicate every story,
p134
aVand that's really what it's all about.
p135
aVLet me tell you a Nigerian joke.
p136
aVWell, it's just a joke, anyway.
p137
aVSo there's Tom, Dick and Harry and they're working construction.
p138
aVAnd Tom opens up his lunch box and there's rice in it,
p139
aVand he goes on this rant about, "Twenty years,
p140
aVmy wife has been packing rice for lunch.
p141
aVIf she does it again tomorrow, I'm going to throw myself
p142
aVoff this building and kill myself."
p143
aVAnd Dick and Harry repeat this.
p144
aVThe next day, Tom opens his lunchbox, there's rice,
p145
aVso he throws himself off and kills himself,
p146
aVand Tom, Dick and Harry follow.
p147
aVAnd now the inquest \u2014 you know, Tom's wife
p148
aVand Dick's wife are distraught.
p149
aVThey wished they'd not packed rice.
p150
aVBut Harry's wife is confused, because she said, "You know,
p151
aVHarry had been packing his own lunch for 20 years."
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VThis seemingly innocent joke, when I heard it as a child in Nigeria,
p155
aVwas told about Igbo, Yoruba and Hausa,
p156
aVwith the Hausa being Harry.
p157
aVSo what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about Harry
p158
aVbecomes a way to spread ethnic hatred.
p159
aVMy father was educated in Cork, in the University of Cork, in the '50s.
p160
aVIn fact, every time I read in Ireland,
p161
aVpeople get me all mistaken and they say,
p162
aV"Oh, this is Chris O'Barney from Cork."
p163
aVBut he was also in Oxford in the '50s,
p164
aVand yet growing up as a child in Nigeria,
p165
aVmy father used to say to me, "You must never eat or drink
p166
aVin a Yoruba person's house because they will poison you."
p167
aVIt makes sense now when I think about it,
p168
aVbecause if you'd known my father,
p169
aVyou would've wanted to poison him too.
p170
aV(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VSo I was born in 1966, at the beginning
p173
aVof the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War, and the war ended after three years.
p174
aVAnd I was growing up in school and the federal government
p175
aVdidn't want us taught about the history of the war,
p176
aVbecause they thought it probably would make us
p177
aVgenerate a new generation of rebels.
p178
aVSo I had a very inventive teacher, a Pakistani Muslim,
p179
aVwho wanted to teach us about this.
p180
aVSo what he did was to teach us Jewish Holocaust history,
p181
aVand so huddled around books with photographs of people in Auschwitz,
p182
aVI learned the melancholic history of my people
p183
aVthrough the melancholic history of another people.
p184
aVI mean, picture this \u2014 really picture this.
p185
aVA Pakistani Muslim teaching Jewish Holocaust history
p186
aVto young Igbo children.
p187
aa(lp188
VStory is powerful.
p189
aVStory is fluid and it belongs to nobody.
p190
aVAnd it should come as no surprise
p191
aVthat my first novel at 16 was about Neo-Nazis
p192
aVtaking over Nigeria to institute the Fourth Reich.
p193
aVIt makes perfect sense.
p194
aVAnd they were to blow up strategic targets
p195
aVand take over the country, and they were foiled
p196
aVby a Nigerian James Bond called Coyote Williams,
p197
aVand a Jewish Nazi hunter.
p198
aVAnd it happened over four continents.
p199
aVAnd when the book came out, I was heralded as Africa's answer
p200
aVto Frederick Forsyth, which is a dubious honor at best.
p201
aVBut also, the book was launched in time for me to be accused
p202
aVof constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt.
p203
aVSo at 18, I was bonded off to prison in Nigeria.
p204
aa(lp205
VI grew up very privileged, and it's important
p206
aVto talk about privilege, because we don't talk about it here.
p207
aVA lot of us are very privileged.
p208
aVI grew up \u2014 servants, cars, televisions, all that stuff.
p209
aVMy story of Nigeria growing up was very different from the story
p210
aVI encountered in prison, and I had no language for it.
p211
aVI was completely terrified, completely broken,
p212
aVand kept trying to find a new language,
p213
aVa new way to make sense of all of this.
p214
aVSix months after that, with no explanation,
p215
aVthey let me go.
p216
aVNow for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know
p217
aVthat it was because it was costing them too much to feed me.
p218
aV(Laughter)
p219
aVBut I mean, I grew up with this incredible privilege,
p220
aVand not just me \u2014 millions of Nigerians
p221
aVgrew up with books and libraries.
p222
aVIn fact, we were talking last night about how all
p223
aVof the steamy novels of Harold Robbins
p224
aVhad done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in Africa
p225
aVthan any sex education programs ever had.
p226
aVAll of those are gone.
p227
aa(lp228
VWe are squandering the most valuable resource
p229
aVwe have on this continent: the valuable resource
p230
aVof the imagination.
p231
aVIn the film, "Sometimes in April" by Raoul Peck,
p232
aVIdris Elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised,
p233
aVand he's being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend \u2014
p234
aVfellow Rwandan Army officer, albeit a Tutsi \u2014
p235
aVplayed by Fraser James.
p236
aVAnd Fraser's on his knees, arms tied behind his back,
p237
aVand he's crying.
p238
aVHe's sniveling.
p239
aVIt's a pitiful sight.
p240
aVAnd as we watch it, we are ashamed.
p241
aVAnd we want to say to Idris, "Chop him up.
p242
aVShut him up."
p243
aVAnd as Idris moves, Fraser screams, "Stop!
p244
aVPlease stop!"
p245
aVIdris pauses, then he moves again,
p246
aVand Fraser says, "Please!
p247
aVPlease stop!"
p248
aVAnd it's not the look of horror and terror on Fraser's face that stops Idris or us;
p249
aVit's the look in Fraser's eyes.
p250
aVIt's one that says, "Don't do this.
p251
aVAnd I'm not saying this to save myself,
p252
aValthough this would be nice. I'm doing it to save you,
p253
aVbecause if you do this, you will be lost."
p254
aVTo be so afraid that you're standing in the face
p255
aVof a death you can't escape and that you're soiling yourself
p256
aVand crying, but to say in that moment,
p257
aVas Fraser says to Idris, "Tell my girlfriend I love her."
p258
aVIn that moment, Fraser says,
p259
aV"I am lost already, but not you ... not you."
p260
aVThis is a redemption we can all aspire to.
p261
aa(lp262
VAfrican narratives in the West, they proliferate.
p263
aVI really don't care anymore.
p264
aVI'm more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves \u2014
p265
aVhow as a writer, I find that African writers
p266
aVhave always been the curators of our humanity on this continent.
p267
aVThe question is, how do I balance narratives that are wonderful
p268
aVwith narratives of wounds and self-loathing?
p269
aVAnd this is the difficulty that I face.
p270
aVI am trying to move beyond political rhetoric
p271
aVto a place of ethical questioning.
p272
aVI am asking us to balance the idea
p273
aVof our complete vulnerability with the complete notion
p274
aVof transformation of what is possible.
p275
aa(lp276
VAs a young middle-class Nigerian activist,
p277
aVI launched myself along with a whole generation of us
p278
aVinto the campaign to stop the government.
p279
aVAnd I asked millions of people,
p280
aVwithout questioning my right to do so,
p281
aVto go up against the government.
p282
aVAnd I watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed.
p283
aVI justified it, and I said, "This is the cost of revolution.
p284
aVHave I not myself been imprisoned?
p285
aVHave I not myself been beaten?"
p286
aVIt wasn't until later, when I was imprisoned again,
p287
aVthat I understood the real meaning of torture,
p288
aVand how easy your humanity can be taken from you,
p289
aVfor the time I was engaged in war,
p290
aVrighteous, righteous war.
p291
aVExcuse me.
p292
aa(lp293
VSometimes I can stand before the world \u2014
p294
aVand when I say this, transformation
p295
aVis a difficult and slow process \u2014
p296
aVsometimes I can stand before the world and say,
p297
aV"My name is Chris Abani.
p298
aVI have been human six days, but only sometimes."
p299
aVBut this is a good thing.
p300
aVIt's never going to be easy.
p301
aVThere are no answers.
p302
aVAs I was telling Rachel from Google Earth,
p303
aVthat I had challenged my students in America \u2014
p304
aVI said, "You don't know anything about Africa, you're all idiots."
p305
aVAnd so they said, "Tell me about Africa, Professor Abani."
p306
aVSo I went to Google Earth and learned about Africa.
p307
aVAnd the truth be told, this is it, isn't it?
p308
aVThere are no essential Africans,
p309
aVand most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else
p310
aVabout the continent we come from,
p311
aVand yet we want to make profound statements about it.
p312
aVAnd I think if we can just admit that we're all trying
p313
aVto approximate the truth of our own communities,
p314
aVit will make for a much more nuanced
p315
aVand a much more interesting conversation.
p316
aVI want to believe that we can be agnostic about this,
p317
aVthat we can rise above all of this.
p318
aa(lp319
VWhen I was 10, I read James Baldwin's "Another Country,"
p320
aVand that book broke me.
p321
aVNot because I was encountering homosexual sex and love
p322
aVfor the first time, but because the way James wrote about it
p323
aVmade it impossible for me to attach otherness to it.
p324
aV"Here," Jimmy said.
p325
aV"Here is love, all of it."
p326
aVThe fact that it happens in "Another Country"
p327
aVtakes you quite by surprise.
p328
aVMy friend Ronald Gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world:
p329
aVthose who can count, and those who can't.
p330
aV(Laughter)
p331
aVHe also says that the cause of all our trouble
p332
aVis the belief in an essential, pure identity:
p333
aVreligious, ethnic, historical, ideological.
p334
aa(lp335
VI want to leave you with a poem by Yusef Komunyakaa
p336
aVthat speaks to transformation.
p337
aVIt's called "Ode to the Drum," and I'll try and read it
p338
aVthe way Yusef would be proud to hear it read.
p339
aV"Gazelle, I killed you for your skin's exquisite touch,
p340
aVfor how easy it is to be nailed to a board
p341
aVweathered raw as white butcher paper.
p342
aVLast night I heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet.
p343
aVYou know it wasn't anger that made me stop my heart till the hammer fell.
p344
aVWeeks ago, you broke me as a woman
p345
aVonce shattered me into a song beneath her weight,
p346
aVbefore you slouched into that grassy hush.
p347
aVAnd now I'm tightening lashes, shaped in hide as if around a ribcage,
p348
aVshaped like five bowstrings.
p349
aVGhosts cannot slip back inside the body's drum.
p350
aVYou've been seasoned by wind, dusk and sunlight.
p351
aVPressure can make everything whole again.
p352
aVBrass nails tacked into the ebony wood,
p353
aVyour face has been carved five times.
p354
aVI have to drive trouble in the hills.
p355
aVTrouble in the valley,
p356
aVand trouble by the river too.
p357
aVThere is no palm wine, fish, salt, or calabash.
p358
aVKadoom. Kadoom. Kadoom.
p359
aVKa-doooom.
p360
aVNow I have beaten a song back into you.
