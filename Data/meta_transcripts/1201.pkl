VBy the end of this year,
p4
aVthere'll be nearly a billion people on this planet
p5
aVthat actively use social networking sites.
p6
aVThe one thing that all of them have in common
p7
aVis that they're going to die.
p8
aVWhile that might be a somewhat morbid thought,
p9
aVI think it has some really profound implications
p10
aVthat are worth exploring.
p11
aa(lp12
VWhat first got me thinking about this
p13
aVwas a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller,
p14
aVwho was a science and technology journalist
p15
aVwho died of cancer.
p16
aVAnd what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post
p17
aVthat went out shortly after he died.
p18
aVHere's what he wrote in starting that out.
p19
aVHe said, "Here it is. I'm dead,
p20
aVand this is my last post to my blog.
p21
aVIn advance, I asked that once my body finally shut down
p22
aVfrom the punishments of my cancer,
p23
aVthen my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote \u2014
p24
aVthe first part of the process
p25
aVof turning this from an active website to an archive."
p26
aa(lp27
VNow, while as a journalist,
p28
aVMiller's archive may have been better written
p29
aVand more carefully curated than most,
p30
aVthe fact of the matter is that all of us today
p31
aVare creating an archive
p32
aVthat's something completely different
p33
aVthan anything that's been created
p34
aVby any previous generation.
p35
aa(lp36
VConsider a few stats for a moment.
p37
aVRight now there are 48 hours of video
p38
aVbeing uploaded to YouTube every single minute.
p39
aVThere are 200 million Tweets being posted every day.
p40
aVAnd the average Facebook user
p41
aVis creating 90 pieces of content each month.
p42
aVSo when you think about your parents or your grandparents,
p43
aVat best they may have created
p44
aVsome photos or home videos,
p45
aVor a diary that lives in a box somewhere.
p46
aVBut today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive
p47
aVthat's going to live in the cloud indefinitely,
p48
aVyears after we're gone.
p49
aVAnd I think that's going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities
p50
aVfor technologists.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow to be clear, I'm a journalist and not a technologist,
p53
aVso what I'd like to do briefly
p54
aVis paint a picture
p55
aVof what the present and the future are going to look like.
p56
aVNow we're already seeing some services
p57
aVthat are designed to let us decide
p58
aVwhat happens to our online profile and our social media accounts
p59
aVafter we die.
p60
aVOne of them actually, fittingly enough,
p61
aVfound me when I checked into a deli
p62
aVat a restaurant in New York
p63
aVon foursquare.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Recording) Adam Ostrow: Hello.
p66
aVDeath: Adam?
p67
aVAO: Yeah.
p68
aVDeath: Death can catch you anywhere, anytime,
p69
aVeven at the Organic.
p70
aVAO: Who is this?
p71
aVDeath: Go to ifidie.net
p72
aVbefore it's too late.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VAdam Ostrow: Kind of creepy, right?
p77
aVSo what that service does, quite simply,
p78
aVis let you create a message or a video
p79
aVthat can be posted to Facebook after you die.
p80
aVAnother service right now
p81
aVis called 1,000 Memories.
p82
aVAnd what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones,
p83
aVcomplete with photos and videos and stories
p84
aVthat they can post after you die.
p85
aVBut what I think comes next is far more interesting.
p86
aa(lp87
VNow a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy
p88
aVwho, back in March,
p89
aVdemonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video.
p90
aVI think as machines' ability
p91
aVto understand human language and process vast amounts of data
p92
aVcontinues to improve,
p93
aVit's going to become possible
p94
aVto analyze an entire life's worth of content \u2014
p95
aVthe Tweets, the photos, the videos, the blog posts \u2014
p96
aVthat we're producing in such massive numbers.
p97
aVAnd I think as that happens,
p98
aVit's going to become possible for our digital personas
p99
aVto continue to interact in the real world long after we're gone
p100
aVthanks to the vastness of the amount of content we're creating
p101
aVand technology's ability to make sense of it all.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow we're already starting to see some experiments here.
p104
aVOne service called My Next Tweet
p105
aVanalyzes your entire Twitter stream, everything you've posted onto Twitter,
p106
aVto make some predictions as to what you might say next.
p107
aVWell right now, as you can see,
p108
aVthe results can be somewhat comical.
p109
aVYou can imagine what something like this might look like
p110
aVfive, 10 or 20 years from now
p111
aVas our technical capabilities improve.
p112
aVTaking it a step further,
p113
aVMIT's media lab is working on robots
p114
aVthat can interact more like humans.
p115
aVBut what if those robots were able to interact
p116
aVbased on the unique characteristics of a specific person
p117
aVbased on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content
p118
aVthat person produces in their lifetime?
p119
aa(lp120
VFinally, think back to this famous scene
p121
aVfrom election night 2008
p122
aVback in the United States,
p123
aVwhere CNN beamed a live hologram
p124
aVof hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio
p125
aVfor an interview with Anderson Cooper.
p126
aVWhat if we were able to use that same type of technology
p127
aVto beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms \u2014
p128
aVinteracting in a very lifelike way
p129
aVbased on all the content they created while they were alive?
p130
aVI think that's going to become completely possible
p131
aVas the amount of data we're producing
p132
aVand technology's ability to understand it
p133
aVboth expand exponentially.
p134
aVNow in closing, I think what we all need to be thinking about
p135
aVis if we want that to become our reality \u2014
p136
aVand if so,
p137
aVwhat it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it.
p138
aVThank you very much.
