VThe public debate about architecture
p4
aVquite often just stays on contemplating the final result,
p5
aVthe architectural object.
p6
aVIs the latest tower in London
p7
aVa gherkin or a sausage
p8
aVor a sex tool?
p9
aa(lp10
VSo recently, we asked ourselves
p11
aVif we could invent a format
p12
aVthat could actually tell the stories behind the projects,
p13
aVmaybe combining images and drawings and words
p14
aVto actually sort of tell stories about architecture.
p15
aVAnd we discovered that we didn't have to invent it,
p16
aVit already existed in the form of a comic book.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo we basically copied the format of the comic book
p19
aVto actually tell the stories of behind the scenes,
p20
aVhow our projects actually evolve through adaptation
p21
aVand improvisation.
p22
aVSort of through the turmoil and the opportunities
p23
aVand the incidents of the real world.
p24
aVWe call this comic book "Yes is More,"
p25
aVwhich is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes.
p26
aa(lp27
VIn this case it's Mies van der Rohe's Less is More.
p28
aVHe triggered the modernist revolution.
p29
aVAfter him followed the post-modern counter-revolution,
p30
aVRobert Venturi saying, "Less is a bore."
p31
aVAfter him, Philip Johnson sort of introduced
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aVyou could say promiscuity, or at least openness
p34
aVto new ideas with, "I am a whore."
p35
aVRecently, Obama has introduced optimism
p36
aVat a sort of time of global financial crisis.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd what we'd like to say with "Yes is More"
p39
aVis basically trying to question this idea
p40
aVthat the architectural avant-garde is almost always negatively defined,
p41
aVas who or what we are against.
p42
aVThe cliche of the radical architect
p43
aVis the sort of angry young man rebelling against the establishment.
p44
aVOr this idea of the misunderstood genius,
p45
aVfrustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas.
p46
aVRather than revolution, we're much more interested in evolution,
p47
aVthis idea that things gradually evolve
p48
aVby adapting and improvising
p49
aVto the changes of the world.
p50
aa(lp51
VIn fact, I actually think that Darwin is one of the people
p52
aVwho best explains our design process.
p53
aVHis famous evolutionary tree
p54
aVcould almost be a diagram of the way we work.
p55
aVAs you can see, a project evolves through
p56
aVa series of generations of design meetings.
p57
aVAt each meeting, there's way too many ideas.
p58
aVOnly the best ones can survive.
p59
aVAnd through a process of architectural selection,
p60
aVwe might choose a really beautiful model
p61
aVor we might have a very functional model.
p62
aVWe mate them. They have sort of mutant offspring.
p63
aVAnd through these sort of generations of design meetings
p64
aVwe arrive at a design.
p65
aa(lp66
VA very literal way of showing it is a project we did
p67
aVfor a library and a hotel in Copenhagen.
p68
aVThe design process was really tough,
p69
aValmost like a struggle for survival,
p70
aVbut gradually an idea evolved:
p71
aVthis sort of idea of a rational tower
p72
aVthat melts together with the surrounding city,
p73
aVsort of expanding the public space onto what we refer to as
p74
aVa Scandinavian version of the Spanish Steps in Rome,
p75
aVbut sort of public on the outside, as well as on the inside,
p76
aVwith the library.
p77
aa(lp78
VBut Darwin doesn't only explain the evolution of a single idea.
p79
aVAs you can see, sometimes a subspecies branches off.
p80
aVAnd quite often we sit in a design meeting
p81
aVand we discover that there is this great idea.
p82
aVIt doesn't really work in this context.
p83
aVBut for another client in another culture,
p84
aVit could really be the right answer to a different question.
p85
aVSo as a result, we never throw anything out.
p86
aVWe keep our office almost like an archive
p87
aVof architectural biodiversity.
p88
aVYou never know when you might need it.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd what I'd like to do now, in an act of
p91
aVwarp-speed storytelling,
p92
aVis tell the story of how two projects evolved
p93
aVby adapting and improvising
p94
aVto the happenstance of the world.
p95
aVThe first story starts last year when we went to Shanghai
p96
aVto do the competition for the Danish
p97
aVNational Pavilion for the World Expo in 2010.
p98
aVAnd we saw this guy, Haibao.
p99
aVHe's the mascot of the expo,
p100
aVand he looks strangely familiar.
p101
aVIn fact he looked like a building we had designed
p102
aVfor a hotel in the north of Sweden.
p103
aVWhen we submitted it for the Swedish competition we thought
p104
aVit was a really cool scheme, but it didn't exactly
p105
aVlook like something from the north of Sweden.
p106
aVThe Swedish jury didn't think so either. So we lost.
p107
aa(lp108
VBut then we had a meeting with a Chinese businessman
p109
aVwho saw our design and said,
p110
aV"Wow, that's the Chinese character for the word 'people.'"
p111
aV(Laughter)
p112
aVSo, apparently this is how you write "people,"
p113
aVas in the People's Republic of China.
p114
aVWe even double checked.
p115
aVAnd at the same time, we got invited to exhibit
p116
aVat the Shanghai Creative Industry Week.
p117
aVSo we thought like, this is too much of an opportunity,
p118
aVso we hired a feng shui master.
p119
aVWe scaled the building up three times to Chinese proportions,
p120
aVand went to China.
p121
aV(Laughter)
p122
aVSo the People's Building, as we called it.
p123
aVThis is our two interpreters, sort of reading the architecture.
p124
aa(lp125
VIt went on the cover of the Wen Wei Po newspaper,
p126
aVwhich got Mr. Liangyu Chen, the mayor of Shanghai,
p127
aVto visit the exhibition.
p128
aVAnd we had the chance to explain the project.
p129
aVAnd he said, "Shanghai is the city in the world
p130
aVwith most skyscrapers,"
p131
aVbut to him it was as if the connection to the roots had been cut over.
p132
aVAnd with the People's Building, he saw an architecture
p133
aVthat could bridge the gap between the ancient wisdom of China
p134
aVand the progressive future of China.
p135
aVSo we obviously profoundly agreed with him.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aV(Applause)
p138
aVUnfortunately, Mr. Chen is now in prison for corruption.
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VBut like I said, Haibao looked very familiar,
p142
aVbecause he is actually the Chinese character for "people."
p143
aVAnd they chose this mascot because
p144
aVthe theme of the expo is "Better City, Better Life."
p145
aVSustainability.
p146
aVAnd we thought, sustainability has grown into being
p147
aVthis sort of neo-Protestant idea
p148
aVthat it has to hurt in order to do good.
p149
aa(lp150
VYou know, you're not supposed to take long, warm showers.
p151
aVYou're not supposed to fly on holidays because it's bad for the environment.
p152
aVGradually, you get this idea that sustainable life
p153
aVis less fun than normal life.
p154
aVSo we thought that maybe it could be interesting to focus on examples
p155
aVwhere a sustainable city
p156
aVactually increases the quality of life.
p157
aa(lp158
VWe also asked ourselves, what could Denmark possibly show China
p159
aVthat would be relevant?
p160
aVYou know, it's one of the biggest countries in the world, one of the smallest.
p161
aVChina symbolized by the dragon.
p162
aVDenmark, we have a national bird, the swan.
p163
aV(Laughter)
p164
aVChina has many great poets,
p165
aa(lp166
Vbut we discovered that in the People's Republic
p167
aVpublic school curriculum,
p168
aVthey have three fairy tales by An Tu Sheng,
p169
aVor Hans Christian Anderson, as we call him.
p170
aVSo that means that all 1.3 billion Chinese
p171
aVhave grown up with "The Emperor's New Clothes,"
p172
aV"The Matchstick Girl" and "The Little Mermaid."
p173
aVIt's almost like a fragment of Danish culture
p174
aVintegrated into Chinese culture.
p175
aa(lp176
VThe biggest tourist attraction in China is the Great Wall.
p177
aVThe Great Wall is the only thing that can be seen from the moon.
p178
aVThe big tourist attraction in Denmark is The Little Mermaid.
p179
aVThat can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours.
p180
aV(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd it sort of shows the difference between these two cities.
p183
aVCopenhagen, Shanghai,
p184
aVmodern, European.
p185
aVBut then we looked at recent urban development,
p186
aVand we noticed that this is like a Shanghai street,
p187
aV30 years ago. All bikes, no cars.
p188
aVThis is how it looks today; all traffic jam.
p189
aVBicycles have become forbidden many places.
p190
aa(lp191
VMeanwhile, in Copenhagen we're actually expanding the bicycle lanes.
p192
aVA third of all the people commute by bike.
p193
aVWe have a free system of bicycles called the City Bike
p194
aVthat you can borrow if you visit the city.
p195
aVSo we thought, why don't we reintroduce the bicycle in China?
p196
aVWe donate 1,000 bikes to Shanghai.
p197
aVSo if you come to the expo, go straight to the Danish pavilion,
p198
aVget a Danish bike, and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions.
p199
aa(lp200
VLike I said, Shanghai and Copenhagen are both port cities,
p201
aVbut in Copenhagen the water has gotten so clean
p202
aVthat you can actually swim in it.
p203
aVOne of the first projects we ever did
p204
aVwas the harbor bath in Copenhagen,
p205
aVsort of continuing the public realm into the water.
p206
aVSo we thought that these expos quite often have a lot of
p207
aVstate financed propaganda,
p208
aVimages, statements, but no real experience.
p209
aVSo just like with a bike, we don't talk about it.
p210
aVYou can try it.
p211
aVLike with the water, instead of talking about it,
p212
aVwe're going to sail a million liters of harbor water
p213
aVfrom Copenhagen to Shanghai,
p214
aVso the Chinese who have the courage can actually dive in
p215
aVand feel how clean it is.
p216
aa(lp217
VThis is where people normally object that it doesn't sound very sustainable
p218
aVto sail water from Copenhagen to China.
p219
aVBut in fact, the container ships go
p220
aVfull of goods from China to Denmark,
p221
aVand then they sail empty back.
p222
aVSo quite often you load water for ballast.
p223
aVSo we can actually hitch a ride for free.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd in the middle of this sort of harbor bath,
p226
aVwe're actually going to put the actual Little Mermaid.
p227
aVSo the real Mermaid, the real water, and the real bikes.
p228
aVAnd when she's gone, we're going to invite
p229
aVa Chinese artist to reinterpret her.
p230
aVThe architecture of the pavilion is this sort of loop
p231
aVof exhibition and bikes.
p232
aVWhen you go to the exhibition, you'll see the Mermaid and the pool.
p233
aVYou'll walk around, start looking for a bicycle on the roof,
p234
aVjump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo when we actually won the competition
p237
aVwe had to do an exhibition in China explaining the project.
p238
aVAnd to our surprise we got one of our boards back
p239
aVwith corrections from the Chinese state censorship.
p240
aVThe first thing, the China map missed Taiwan.
p241
aVIt's a very serious political issue in China. We will add on.
p242
aVThe second thing, we had compared the swan to the dragon,
p243
aVand then the Chinese state said,
p244
aV"Suggest change to panda."
p245
aV(Laughter)
p246
aV(Applause)
p247
aa(lp248
VSo, when it came out in Denmark that we were actually going to
p249
aVmove our national monument,
p250
aVthe National People's Party sort of rebelled against it.
p251
aVThey tried to pass a law against moving the Mermaid.
p252
aVSo for the first time, I got invited to speak at the National Parliament.
p253
aVIt was kind of interesting because in the morning, from 9 to 11,
p254
aVthey were discussing the bailout package \u2014
p255
aVhow many billions to invest in saving the Danish economy.
p256
aVAnd then at 11 o'clock they stopped talking about these little issues.
p257
aVAnd then from 11 to 1,
p258
aVthey were debating whether or not to send the Mermaid to China.
p259
aV(Laughter)
p260
aV(Applause)
p261
aa(lp262
VBut to conclude, if you want to see the Mermaid from May to December
p263
aVnext year, don't come to Copenhagen,
p264
aVbecause she's going to be in Shanghai.
p265
aVIf you do come to Copenhagen,
p266
aVyou will probably see an installation by Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist.
p267
aVBut if the Chinese government intervenes, it might even be a panda.
p268
aV(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VSo the second story that I'd like to tell
p271
aVis, actually starts in my own house.
p272
aVThis is my apartment.
p273
aVThis is the view from my apartment,
p274
aVover the sort of landscape of triangular balconies
p275
aVthat our client called the Leonardo DiCaprio balcony.
p276
aVAnd they form this sort of vertical backyard
p277
aVwhere, on a nice summer day, you'll actually get introduced to all your neighbors
p278
aVin a vertical radius of 10 meters.
p279
aVThe house is sort of a distortion of a square block.
p280
aVTrying to zigzag it to make sure
p281
aVthat all of the apartments look at the straight views,
p282
aVinstead of into each other.
p283
aa(lp284
VUntil recently, this was the view from my apartment,
p285
aVonto this place where our client actually bought the neighbor site.
p286
aVAnd he said that he was going to do an apartment block
p287
aVnext to a parking structure.
p288
aVAnd we thought, rather than doing a traditional stack of apartments
p289
aVlooking straight into a big boring block of cars,
p290
aVwhy don't we turn all the apartments into penthouses,
p291
aVput them on a podium of cars.
p292
aa(lp293
VAnd because Copenhagen is completely flat,
p294
aVif you want to have a nice south-facing slope with a view,
p295
aVyou basically have to do it yourself.
p296
aVThen we sort of cut up the volume,
p297
aVso we wouldn't block the view from my apartment.
p298
aV(Laughter)
p299
aVAnd essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space
p300
aVunderneath the apartments.
p301
aa(lp302
VAnd up in the sun, you have a single layer of apartments
p303
aVthat combine all the splendors of a suburban lifestyle,
p304
aVlike a house with a garden with a sort of metropolitan view,
p305
aVand a sort of dense urban location.
p306
aVThis is our first architectural model.
p307
aVThis is an aerial photo taken last summer.
p308
aVAnd essentially, the apartments cover the parking.
p309
aVThey are accessed through this diagonal elevator.
p310
aVIt's actually a stand-up product from Switzerland,
p311
aVbecause in Switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators.
p312
aV(Laughter)
p313
aa(lp314
VAnd the facade of the parking,
p315
aVwe wanted to make the parking naturally ventilated,
p316
aVso we needed to perforate it.
p317
aVAnd we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes,
p318
aVwe could actually turn the entire facade
p319
aVinto a gigantic, naturally ventilated,
p320
aVrasterized image.
p321
aVAnd since we always refer to the project as The Mountain,
p322
aVwe commissioned this Japanese Himalaya photographer
p323
aVto give us this beautiful photo of Mount Everest,
p324
aVmaking the entire building a 3,000 square meter artwork.
p325
aV(Applause)
p326
aa(lp327
VSo if you go back into the parking, into the corridors,
p328
aVit's almost like traveling into a parallel universe
p329
aVfrom cars and colors,
p330
aVinto this sort of south-facing urban oasis.
p331
aVThe wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades.
p332
aVIf you go even further, it turns into this green garden.
p333
aVAnd all the rainwater that drops on the Mountain
p334
aVis actually accumulated.
p335
aVAnd there is an automatic irrigation system
p336
aVthat makes sure that this sort of landscape of gardens,
p337
aVin one or two years it will sort of transform
p338
aVinto a Cambodian temple ruin,
p339
aVcompletely covered in green.
p340
aa(lp341
VSo, the Mountain is like our first built example
p342
aVof what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy.
p343
aVThis idea that you can actually create, if not gold,
p344
aVthen at least added value by mixing
p345
aVtraditional ingredients, like normal apartments
p346
aVand normal parking,
p347
aVand in this case actually offer people
p348
aVthe chance that they don't have to choose between
p349
aVa life with a garden or a life in the city.
p350
aVThey can actually have both.
p351
aa(lp352
VAs an architect, it's really hard to set the agenda.
p353
aVYou can't just say that now I'd like to do a sustainable city
p354
aVin central Asia,
p355
aVbecause that's not really how you get commissions.
p356
aVYou always have to sort of adapt and improvise
p357
aVto the opportunities and accidents that happen,
p358
aVand the sort of turmoil of the world.
p359
aa(lp360
VOne last example is that recently we,
p361
aVlike last summer, we won the competition
p362
aVto design a Nordic national bank.
p363
aVThis was the director of the bank when he was still smiling.
p364
aV(Laughter)
p365
aVIt was in the middle of the capital so we were really excited by this opportunity.
p366
aVUnfortunately, it was the national bank of Iceland.
p367
aa(lp368
VAt the same time, we actually had a visitor \u2014
p369
aVa minister from Azerbaijan came to our office.
p370
aVWe took him to see the Mountain. And he got very excited
p371
aVby this idea that you could actually make mountains
p372
aVout of architecture,
p373
aVbecause Azerbaijan is known as the Alps of Central Asia.
p374
aVSo he asked us if we could actually imagine
p375
aVan urban master plan
p376
aVon an island outside the capital
p377
aVthat would recreate the silhouette of the seven most significant mountains
p378
aVof Azerbaijan.
p379
aa(lp380
VSo we took the commission.
p381
aVAnd we made this small movie that I'd like to show.
p382
aVWe quite often make little movies.
p383
aVWe always argue a lot about the soundtrack,
p384
aVbut in this case it was really easy to choose the song.
p385
aVSo basically, Baku is this sort of crescent bay
p386
aVoverlooking the island of Zira, the island that we are planning \u2014
p387
aValmost like the diagram of their flag.
p388
aVAnd our main idea was
p389
aVto sort of sample the seven most significant mountains
p390
aVof the topography of Azerbaijan
p391
aVand reinterpret them into urban and architectural structures,
p392
aVinhabitable of human life.
p393
aVThen we place these mountains on the island,
p394
aVsurrounding this sort of central green valley,
p395
aValmost like a central park.
p396
aa(lp397
VAnd what makes it interesting is that the island right now
p398
aVis just a piece of desert. It has no vegetation.
p399
aVIt has no water. It has no energy, no resources.
p400
aVSo we actually sort of designed the entire island as a single ecosystem,
p401
aVexploiting wind energy to drive the desalination plants,
p402
aVand to use the thermal properties of water
p403
aVto heat and cool the buildings.
p404
aVAnd all the sort of excess freshwater wastewater
p405
aVis filtered organically into the landscape,
p406
aVgradually transforming the desert island
p407
aVinto sort of a green, lush landscape.
p408
aa(lp409
VSo, you can say where an urban development
p410
aVnormally happens at the expense of nature,
p411
aVin this case it's actually creating nature.
p412
aVAnd the buildings, they don't only sort of
p413
aVinvoke the imagery of the mountains,
p414
aVthey also operate like mountains.
p415
aVThey create shelter from the wind.
p416
aVThey accumulate the solar energy.
p417
aVThey accumulate the water.
p418
aVSo they actually transform the entire island
p419
aVinto a single ecosystem.
p420
aa(lp421
VSo we recently presented the master plan,
p422
aVand it has gotten approved.
p423
aVAnd this summer we are starting the construction documents
p424
aVof the two first mountains,
p425
aVin what's going to be the first carbon-neutral island
p426
aVin Central Asia.
p427
aV(Applause)
p428
aVYes, maybe just to round off.
p429
aVSo in a way you can see how the Mountain in Copenhagen
p430
aVsort of evolved into the Seven Peaks of Azerbaijan.
p431
aVWith a little luck and some more evolution,
p432
aVmaybe in 10 years it could be the Five Mountains on Mars.
p433
aVThank you.
