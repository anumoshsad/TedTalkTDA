VA few years ago,
p4
aVI got one of those spam emails.
p5
aVAnd it managed to get through my spam filter.
p6
aVI'm not quite sure how, but it turned up in my inbox,
p7
aVand it was from a guy called Solomon Odonkoh.
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VI know.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VIt went like this:
p16
aVit said, "Hello James Veitch,
p17
aVI have an interesting business proposal I want to share with you, Solomon."
p18
aVNow, my hand was kind of hovering on the delete button, right?
p19
aVI was looking at my phone. I thought, I could just delete this.
p20
aVOr I could do what I think we've all always wanted to do.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd I said, "Solomon, Your email intrigues me."
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
V(Applause)
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd the game was afoot.
p31
aa(lp32
VHe said, "Dear James Veitch, We shall be shipping Gold to you."
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
V"You will earn 10% of any gold you distributes."
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VSo I knew I was dealing with a professional.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VI said, "How much is it worth?"
p45
aa(lp46
VHe said, "We will start with smaller quantity," \u2014
p47
aVI was like, aww \u2014
p48
aVand then he said, "of 25 kgs.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VThe worth should be about $2.5 million."
p53
aa(lp54
VI said, "Solomon, if we're going to do it, let's go big.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Applause)
p57
aa(lp58
VI can handle it. How much gold do you have?"
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VHe said, "It is not a matter of how much gold I have,
p63
aVwhat matters is your capability of handling.
p64
aVWe can start with 50 kgs as trial shipment."
p65
aa(lp66
VI said, "50 kgs?
p67
aVThere's no point doing this at all
p68
aVunless you're shipping at least a metric ton."
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
V(Applause)
p73
aa(lp74
VHe said, "What do you do for a living?"
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VI said, "I'm a hedge fund executive bank manager."
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VThis isn't the first time I've shipped bullion, my friend,
p83
aVno no no.
p84
aa(lp85
VThen I started to panic.
p86
aVI was like, "Where are you based?"
p87
aVI don't know about you,
p88
aVbut I think if we're going via the postal service,
p89
aVit ought to be signed for.
p90
aVThat's a lot of gold."
p91
aa(lp92
VHe said, "It will not be easy to convince my company
p93
aVto do larger quantity shipment."
p94
aa(lp95
VI said, "Solomon, I'm completely with you on this one.
p96
aVI'm putting together a visual for you to take into the board meeting.
p97
aVHold tight."
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VThis is what I sent Solomon.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
V(Applause)
p106
aa(lp107
VI don't know if we have any statisticians in the house,
p108
aVbut there's definitely something going on.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VI said, "Solomon, attached to this email you'll find a helpful chart.
p113
aVI've had one of my assistants run the numbers.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VWe're ready for shipping as much gold as possible."
p118
aa(lp119
VThere's always a moment where they try to tug your heartstrings,
p120
aVand this was it for Solomon.
p121
aVHe said, "I will be so much happy if the deal goes well,
p122
aVbecause I'm going to get a very good commission as well."
p123
aVAnd I said, "That's amazing, What are you going to spend your cut on?"
p124
aVAnd he said, "On RealEstate, what about you?"
p125
aa(lp126
VI thought about it for a long time.
p127
aVAnd I said, "One word;
p128
aVHummus."
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
V"It's going places.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VI was in Sainsbury's the other day
p137
aVand there were like 30 different varieties.
p138
aVAlso you can cut up carrots, and you can dip them.
p139
aVHave you ever done that, Solomon?"
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VHe said, "I have to go bed now."
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
V(Applause)
p148
aa(lp149
V"Till morrow.
p150
aVHave sweet dream."
p151
aa(lp152
VI didn't know what to say!
p153
aVI said, "Bonsoir my golden nugget, bonsoir."
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VGuys, you have to understand, this had been going for, like, weeks,
p158
aValbeit hitherto the greatest weeks of my life,
p159
aVbut I had to knock it on the head.
p160
aVIt was getting a bit out of hand.
p161
aVFriends were saying, "James, do you want to come for a drink?"
p162
aVI was like, "I can't, I'm expecting an email about some gold."
p163
aa(lp164
VSo I figured I had to knock it on the head.
p165
aVI had to take it to a ridiculous conclusion.
p166
aVSo I concocted a plan.
p167
aVI said, "Solomon, I'm concerned about security.
p168
aVWhen we email each other,
p169
aVwe need to use a code."
p170
aVAnd he agreed.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VI said, "Solomon, I spent all night coming up with this code
p175
aVwe need to use in all further correspondence:
p176
aa(lp177
VLawyer: Gummy Bear.
p178
aa(lp179
VBank: Cream Egg.
p180
aa(lp181
VLegal: Fizzy Cola Bottle. Claim: Peanut M&Ms.
p182
aa(lp183
VDocuments: Jelly Beans.
p184
aa(lp185
VWestern Union: A Giant Gummy Lizard."
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VI knew these were all words they use, right?
p190
aVI said, "Please call me Kitkat in all further correspondence."
p191
aa(lp192
V(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VI didn't hear back. I thought, I've gone too far.
p195
aVI've gone too far. So I had to backpedal a little.
p196
aVI said, "Solomon, Is the deal still on?
p197
aVKitKat."
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VBecause you have to be consistent.
p202
aVThen I did get an email back from him.
p203
aVHe said, "The Business is on and I am trying to blah blah blah ..."
p204
aa(lp205
VI said, "Dude, you have to use the code!"
p206
aVWhat followed is the greatest email I've ever received.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VI'm not joking, this is what turned up in my inbox.
p211
aVThis was a good day.
p212
aV"The business is on.
p213
aVI am trying to raise the balance for the Gummy Bear \u2014
p214
aa(lp215
V(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
Vso he can submit all the needed Fizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans
p218
aVto the Creme Egg,
p219
aVfor the Peanut M&Ms process to start.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VSend 1,500 pounds
p224
aVvia a Giant Gummy Lizard."
p225
aa(lp226
V(Applause)
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd that was so much fun, right,
p229
aVthat it got me thinking:
p230
aVlike, what would happen if I just spent as much time as could
p231
aVreplying to as many scam emails as I could?
p232
aVAnd that's what I've been doing
p233
aVfor three years
p234
aVon your behalf.
p235
aa(lp236
V(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
V(Applause)
p239
aa(lp240
VCrazy stuff happens when you start replying to scam emails.
p241
aVIt's really difficult,
p242
aVand I highly recommend we do it.
p243
aVI don't think what I'm doing is mean.
p244
aVThere are a lot of people who do mean things to scammers.
p245
aVAll I'm doing is wasting their time.
p246
aVAnd I think any time they're spending with me
p247
aVis time they're not spending scamming vulnerable adults
p248
aVout of their savings, right?
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd if you're going to do this \u2014 and I highly recommend you do \u2014
p251
aVget yourself a pseudonymous email address.
p252
aVDon't use your own email address.
p253
aVThat's what I was doing at the start and it was a nightmare.
p254
aVI'd wake up in the morning and have a thousand emails
p255
aVabout penis enlargements,
p256
aVonly one of which was a legitimate response \u2014
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
Vto a medical question I had.
p261
aa(lp262
VBut I'll tell you what, though, guys,
p263
aVI'll tell you what: any day is a good day, any day is a good day
p264
aVif you receive an email that begins like this:
p265
aa(lp266
V(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
V"I AM WINNIE MANDELA,
p269
aVTHE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT."
p270
aVI was like, oh! \u2014 that Winnie Mandela.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VI know so many.
p275
aa(lp276
V"I NEED TO TRANSFER 45 MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF THE COUNTRY
p277
aVBECAUSE OF MY HUSBAND NELSON MANDELA'S HEALTH CONDITION."
p278
aa(lp279
VLet that sink in.
p280
aVShe sent me this, which is hysterical.
p281
aa(lp282
V(Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd this.
p285
aVAnd this looks fairly legitimate, this is a letter of authorization.
p286
aVBut to be honest, if there's nothing written on it, it's just a shape!
p287
aa(lp288
V(Laughter)
p289
aa(lp290
VI said, "Winnie, I'm really sorry to hear of this.
p291
aVGiven that Nelson died three months ago,
p292
aVI'd describe his health condition as fairly serious."
p293
aa(lp294
V(Laughter)
p295
aa(lp296
VThat's the worst health condition you can have, not being alive.
p297
aa(lp298
VShe said, "KINDLY COMPLY WITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS.
p299
aVONE LOVE."
p300
aa(lp301
V(Laughter)
p302
aa(lp303
VI said, "Of course. NO WOMAN, NO CRY."
p304
aa(lp305
V(Laughter)
p306
aa(lp307
V(Applause)
p308
aa(lp309
VShe said, "MY BANKER WILL NEED TRANSFER OF 3000 DOLLARS. ONE LOVE."
p310
aa(lp311
V(Laughter)
p312
aa(lp313
VI said, "no problemo.
p314
aa(lp315
VI SHOT THE SHERIFF."
p316
aa(lp317
V[ (BUT I DID NOT SHOOT THE DEPUTY) ]
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
VThank you.
p322
aa(lp323
V(Applause)
