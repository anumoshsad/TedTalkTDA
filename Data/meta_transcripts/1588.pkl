VIn 1975, I met in Florence a professor, Carlo Pedretti,
p4
aVmy former professor of art history, and today
p5
aVa world-renowned scholar of Leonardo da Vinci.
p6
aVWell, he asked me if I could find some technological way
p7
aVto unfold a five-centuries-old mystery related to
p8
aVa lost masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci,
p9
aVthe "Battle of Anghiari," which is supposed to be located
p10
aVin the Hall of the 500 in Palazzo Vecchio, in Florence.
p11
aVWell, in the mid-'70s, there were not great opportunities
p12
aVfor a bioengineer like me, especially in Italy, and so
p13
aVI decided, with some researchers from the United States
p14
aVand the University of Florence, to start probing the murals
p15
aVdecorated by Vasari on the long walls of the Hall of the 500
p16
aVsearching for the lost Leonardo.
p17
aa(lp18
VUnfortunately, at that time we did not know that
p19
aVthat was not exactly where we should be looking,
p20
aVbecause we had to go much deeper in, and so the research
p21
aVcame to a halt, and it was only taken up in 2000
p22
aVthanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the Guinness family.
p23
aVWell, this time, we focused on trying to reconstruct
p24
aVthe way the Hall of the 500 was before the remodeling,
p25
aVand the so-called Sala Grande, which was built in 1494,
p26
aVand to find out the original doors, windows,
p27
aVand in order to do that, we first created a 3D model,
p28
aVand then, with thermography, we went on to discover
p29
aVhidden windows. These are the original windows of the hall
p30
aVof the Sala Grande. We also found out about the height
p31
aVof the ceiling, and we managed to reconstruct, therefore,
p32
aVall the layout of this original hall
p33
aVthe way it was before there came Vasari,
p34
aVand restructured the whole thing,
p35
aVincluding a staircase that was very important
p36
aVin order to precisely place "The Battle of Anghiari"
p37
aVon a specific area of one of the two walls.
p38
aa(lp39
VWell, we also learned that Vasari, who was commissioned
p40
aVto remodel the Hall of the 500 between 1560 and 1574
p41
aVby the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family,
p42
aVwe have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces
p43
aVspecifically by placing a brick wall in front of it
p44
aVand leaving a small air gap.
p45
aVOne that we [see] here, Masaccio, the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence,
p46
aVso we just said, well maybe, Visari has done something
p47
aVlike that in the case of this great work of art by Leonardo,
p48
aVsince he was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas
p51
aVjust for probing both walls and searching for an air gap.
p52
aVAnd we did find many on the right panel of the east wall,
p53
aVan air gap, and that's where
p54
aVwe believe "The Battle of Anghiari,"
p55
aVor at least the part that we know has been painted,
p56
aVwhich is called "The Fight for the Standard," should be located.
p57
aa(lp58
VWell, from there, unfortunately,
p59
aVin 2004, the project
p60
aVcame to a halt. Many political reasons.
p61
aVSo I decided to go back to my alma mater,
p62
aVand, at the University of California, San Diego,
p63
aVand I proposed to open up a research center
p64
aVfor engineering sciences for cultural heritage.
p65
aVAnd in 2007, we created CISA3 as a research center
p66
aVfor cultural heritage, specifically art, architecture
p67
aVand archaeology. So students started to flow in,
p68
aVand we started to build technologies, because that's
p69
aVbasically what we also needed in order to move forward
p70
aVand go and do fieldwork.
p71
aa(lp72
VWe came back in the Hall of the 500 in 2011,
p73
aVand this time, with a great group of students,
p74
aVand my colleague, Professor Falko Kuester,
p75
aVwho is now the director at CISA3, and we
p76
aVcame back just since we knew already where to look for
p77
aVto find out if there was still something left.
p78
aVWell, we were confined though, limited, I should rather say,
p79
aVfor several reasons that it's not worth explaining,
p80
aVto endoscopy only, of the many other options we had,
p81
aVand with a 4mm camera attached to it,
p82
aVwe were successful in documenting and taking
p83
aVsome fragments of what it turns out to be
p84
aVa reddish color, black color, and there is some
p85
aVbeige fragments that later on
p86
aVwe ran a much more sophisticated exams,
p87
aVXRF, X-ray diffraction, and the results are very positive
p88
aVso far. It seems to indicate that indeed
p89
aVwe have found some pigments, and since we know for sure
p90
aVthat no other artist has painted on that wall
p91
aVbefore Vasari came in about 60 years later, well,
p92
aVthose pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting
p93
aVand most likely to Leonardo.
p94
aa(lp95
VWell, we are searching for the highest and highly praised
p96
aVwork of art ever achieved by mankind.
p97
aVAs a matter of fact, this is by far the most important
p98
aVcommission that Leonardo has ever had,
p99
aVand for doing this great masterpiece, he was named
p100
aVthe number one artist influence at the time.
p101
aa(lp102
VI had also had the privilege since the last 37 years
p103
aVto work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me,
p104
aVbut basically to do what? Well, to assess, for example,
p105
aVthe state of conservation. See here the face of the
p106
aVMadonna of the Chair that when just shining a UV light on it
p107
aVyou suddenly see another, different lady,
p108
aVaged lady, I should rather say.
p109
aVThere is a lot of varnish still sitting there, several retouches,
p110
aVand some over cleaning. It becomes very visible.
p111
aa(lp112
VBut also, technology has helped to write new pages
p113
aVof our history, or at least to update pages of our histories.
p114
aVFor example, the "Lady with the Unicorn,"
p115
aVanother painting by Rafael, well, you see the unicorn.
p116
aVA lot has been said and written about the unicorn, but
p117
aVif you take an X-ray of the unicorn, it becomes a puppy dog.
p118
aVAnd \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 no problem, but, unfortunately,
p119
aVcontinuing with the scientific examination of this painting
p120
aVcame out that Rafael did not paint the unicorn,
p121
aVdid not paint the puppy dog, actually left the painting
p122
aVunfinished, so all this writing about the exotic symbol
p123
aVof the unicorn \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 unfortunately,
p124
aVis not very reliable. (Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VWell, also, authenticity. Just think for a moment
p127
aVif science really could move in the field of authenticity
p128
aVof works of art. There would be a cultural revolution
p129
aVto say the least, but also, I would say, a market revolution,
p130
aVlet me add. Take this example:
p131
aVOtto Marseus, nice painting, which is "Still Life"
p132
aVat the Pitti Gallery, and just have an infrared camera peering through,
p133
aVand luckily for art historians, it just was confirmed
p134
aVthat there is a signature of Otto Marseus. It even says
p135
aVwhen it was made and also the location.
p136
aVSo that was a good result. Sometimes, it's not that good,
p137
aVand so, again, authenticity and science could go together
p138
aVand change the way, not attributions being made,
p139
aVbut at least lay the ground for a more objective,
p140
aVor, I should rather say, less subjective attribution,
p141
aVas it is done today.
p142
aa(lp143
VBut I would say the discovery that really caught
p144
aVmy imagination, my admiration, is the incredibly vivid
p145
aVdrawing under this layer, brown layer,
p146
aVof "The Adoration of the Magi." Here you see
p147
aVa handmade setting XYZ scanner with an infrared camera put on it,
p148
aVand just peering through this brown layer
p149
aVof this masterpiece to reveal
p150
aVwhat could have been underneath.
p151
aVWell, this happens to be the most important painting
p152
aVwe have in Italy by Leonardo da Vinci, and
p153
aVlook at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen
p154
aVfor five centuries. Look at these portraits.
p155
aVThey're magnificent. You see Leonardo at work.
p156
aVYou see the geniality of his creation, right directly
p157
aVon the ground layer of the panel, and see
p158
aVthis cool thing, finding, I should rather say,
p159
aVan elephant. (Laughter) Because of this elephant,
p160
aVover 70 new images came out, never seen for centuries.
p161
aVThis was an epiphany. We came to understand
p162
aVand to prove that the brown coating that we see today
p163
aVwas not done by Leonardo da Vinci, which left us
p164
aVonly the other drawing that for five centuries
p165
aVwe were not able to see, so thanks only to technology.
p166
aa(lp167
VWell, the tablet. Well, we thought, well, if we all have
p168
aVthis pleasure, this privilege to see all this,
p169
aVto find all these discoveries, what about for everybody else?
p170
aVSo we thought of an augmented reality application
p171
aVusing a tablet. Let me show you just simulating
p172
aVwhat we could be doing, any of us could be doing,
p173
aVin a museum environment.
p174
aVSo let's say that we go to a museum with a tablet, okay?
p175
aVAnd we just aim the camera of the tablet
p176
aVto the painting that we are interested to see, like this.
p177
aVOkay? And I will just click on it, we pause,
p178
aVand now let me turn to you so the moment the image,
p179
aVor, I should say, the camera, has locked in the painting,
p180
aVthen the images you just saw up there in the drawing
p181
aVare being loaded. And so, see.
p182
aVWe can, as we said, we can zoom in. Then we can scroll.
p183
aVOkay? Let's go and find the elephant.
p184
aVSo all we need is one finger. Just wipe off
p185
aVand we see the elephant. (Applause)
p186
aV(Applause)
p187
aVOkay? And then if we want,
p188
aVwe can continue the scroll to find out, for example,
p189
aVon the staircase, the whole iconography is going
p190
aVto be changed. There are a lot of laymen reconstructing
p191
aVfrom the ruins of an old temple a new temple,
p192
aVand there are a lot of figures showing up. See?
p193
aa(lp194
VThis is not just a curiosity, because it changes
p195
aVnot just the iconography as you see it, but the iconology,
p196
aVthe meaning of the painting,
p197
aVand we believe this is a cool way, easy way,
p198
aVthat everybody could have access to, to become more
p199
aVthe protagonist of your own discovery, and not just
p200
aVbe so passive about it, as we are when we walk through
p201
aVendless rooms of museums.
p202
aV(Applause)
p203
aa(lp204
VAnother concept is the digital clinical chart, which sounds
p205
aVvery obvious if we were to talk about real patients,
p206
aVbut when we talk about works of art, unfortunately,
p207
aVit's never been tapped as an idea.
p208
aVWell, we believe, again, that this should be the beginning,
p209
aVthe very first step, to do real conservation,
p210
aVand allowing us to really explore and to understand
p211
aVeverything related to the state of our conservation,
p212
aVthe technique, materials, and also if, when, and why
p213
aVwe should restore, or, rather, to intervene on
p214
aVthe environment surrounding the painting.
p215
aa(lp216
VWell, our vision is to rediscover
p217
aVthe spirit of the Renaissance, create a new discipline
p218
aVwhere engineering for cultural heritage is actually
p219
aVa symbol of blending art and science together.
p220
aVWe definitely need a new breed of engineers
p221
aVthat will go out and do this kind of work and
p222
aVrediscover for us these values, these cultural values
p223
aVthat we badly need, especially today.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd if you want to summarize in one just single word,
p226
aVwell, this is what we're trying to do.
p227
aVWe're trying to give a future to our past
p228
aVin order to have a future.
p229
aVAs long as we live a life of curiosity and passion,
p230
aVthere is a bit of Leonardo in all of us. Thank you. (Applause)
