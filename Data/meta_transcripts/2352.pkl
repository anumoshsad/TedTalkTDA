VFather Daniel Berrigan once said that "writing about prisoners
p4
aVis a little like writing about the dead."
p5
aVI think what he meant is that we treat prisoners as ghosts.
p6
aVThey're unseen and unheard.
p7
aVIt's easy to simply ignore them
p8
aVand it's even easier when the government goes to great lengths to keep them hidden.
p9
aa(lp10
VAs a journalist, I think these stories
p11
aVof what people in power do when no one is watching,
p12
aVare precisely the stories that we need to tell.
p13
aVThat's why I began investigating
p14
aVthe most secretive and experimental prison units in the United States,
p15
aVfor so-called "second-tier" terrorists.
p16
aVThe government calls these units Communications Management Units or CMUs.
p17
aVPrisoners and guards call them "Little Guantanamo."
p18
aVThey are islands unto themselves.
p19
aVBut unlike Gitmo they exist right here, at home,
p20
aVfloating within larger federal prisons.
p21
aa(lp22
VThere are 2 CMUs.
p23
aVOne was opened inside the prison in Terre Haute, Indiana,
p24
aVand the other is inside this prison, in Marion, Illinois.
p25
aVNeither of them underwent the formal review process
p26
aVthat is required by law when they were opened.
p27
aVCMU prisoners have all been convicted of crimes.
p28
aVSome of their cases are questionable and some involve threats and violence.
p29
aVI'm not here to argue the guilt or innocence of any prisoner.
p30
aVI'm here because as Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall said,
p31
aV"When the prisons and gates slam shut,
p32
aVprisoners do not lose their human quality."
p33
aa(lp34
VEvery prisoner I've interviewed has said there are three flecks of light
p35
aVin the darkness of prison:
p36
aVphone calls,
p37
aVletters
p38
aVand visits from family.
p39
aVCMUs aren't solitary confinement, but they radically restrict all of these
p40
aVto levels that meet or exceed the most extreme prisons in the United States.
p41
aVTheir phone calls can be limited to 45 minutes a month,
p42
aVcompared to the 300 minutes other prisoners receive.
p43
aVTheir letters can be limited to six pieces of paper.
p44
aVTheir visits can be limited to four hours per month,
p45
aVcompared to the 35 hours that people like Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph
p46
aVreceive in the supermax.
p47
aVOn top of that, CMU visits are non-contact which means prisoners are not allowed
p48
aVto even hug their family.
p49
aVAs one CMU prisoner said,
p50
aV"We're not being tortured here, except psychologically."
p51
aa(lp52
VThe government won't say who is imprisoned here.
p53
aVBut through court documents, open records requests
p54
aVand interviews with current and former prisoners,
p55
aVsome small windows into the CMUs have opened.
p56
aa(lp57
VThere's an estimated 60 to 70 prisoners here,
p58
aVand they're overwhelmingly Muslim.
p59
aVThey include people like Dr. Rafil Dhafir,
p60
aVwho violated the economic sanctions on Iraq by sending medical supplies
p61
aVfor the children there.
p62
aVThey've included people like Yassin Aref.
p63
aVAref and his family fled to New York from Saddam Hussein's Iraq as refugees.
p64
aVHe was arrested in 2004 as part of an FBI sting.
p65
aVAref is an imam and he was asked to bear witness to a loan,
p66
aVwhich is a tradition in Islamic culture.
p67
aVIt turned out that one of the people involved in the loan was trying to enlist
p68
aVsomeone else in a fake attack.
p69
aVAref didn't know.
p70
aVFor that, he was convicted
p71
aVof conspiracy to provide material support to a terrorist group.
p72
aa(lp73
VThe CMUs also include some non-Muslim prisoners.
p74
aVThe guards call them "balancers,"
p75
aVmeaning they help balance out the racial numbers,
p76
aVin hopes of deflecting law suits.
p77
aVThese balancers include animal rights and environmental activists
p78
aVlike Daniel McGowan.
p79
aa(lp80
VMcGowan was convicted of participating in two arsons
p81
aVin the name of defending the environment
p82
aVas part of the Earth Liberation Front.
p83
aVDuring his sentencing, he was afraid that he would be sent
p84
aVto a rumored secret prison for terrorists.
p85
aVThe judge dismissed all those fears,
p86
aVsaying that they weren't supported by any facts.
p87
aVBut that might be because the government hasn't fully explained
p88
aVwhy some prisoners end up in a CMU,
p89
aVand who is responsible for these decisions.
p90
aVWhen McGowan was transferred, he was told
p91
aVit's because he is a "domestic terrorist,"
p92
aVa term the FBI uses repeatedly when talking about environmental activists.
p93
aVNow, keep in mind there are about 400 prisoners in US prisons
p94
aVwho are classified as terrorists,
p95
aVand only a handful of them are in the CMUs.
p96
aVIn McGowan's case, he was previously at a low-security prison
p97
aVand he had no communications violations.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo, why was he moved?
p100
aVLike other CMU prisoners,
p101
aVMcGowan repeatedly asked for an answer, a hearing,
p102
aVor some opportunity for an appeal.
p103
aVThis example from another prisoner shows how those requests are viewed.
p104
aV"Wants a transfer." "Told him no."
p105
aVAt one point, the prison warden himself recommended McGowan's transfer
p106
aVout of the CMU citing his good behavior,
p107
aVbut the warden was overruled
p108
aVby the Bureau of Prison's Counterterrorism Unit,
p109
aVworking with the Joint Terrorism Task Force of the FBI.
p110
aa(lp111
VLater I found out that McGowan was really sent to a CMU
p112
aVnot because of what he did,
p113
aVbut what he has said.
p114
aVA memo from the Counterterrorism Unit cited McGowan's "anti-government beliefs."
p115
aVWhile imprisoned, he continued writing about environmental issues,
p116
aVsaying that activists must reflect on their mistakes
p117
aVand listen to each other.
p118
aVNow, in fairness, if you've spent any time at all in Washington, DC,
p119
aVyou know this is really a radical concept for the government.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VI actually asked to visit McGowan in the CMU.
p124
aVAnd I was approved.
p125
aVThat came as quite a shock.
p126
aVFirst, because as I've discussed on this stage before,
p127
aVI learned that the FBI has been monitoring my work.
p128
aVSecond, because it would make me the first and only journalist to visit a CMU.
p129
aVI had even learned
p130
aVthrough the Bureau of Prisons Counterterrorism Unit,
p131
aVthat they had been monitoring my speeches about CMUs, like this one.
p132
aVSo how could I possibly be approved to visit?
p133
aVA few days before I went out to the prison, I got an answer.
p134
aa(lp135
VI was allowed to visit McGowan as a friend, not a journalist.
p136
aVJournalists are not allowed here.
p137
aVMcGowan was told by CMU officials that if I asked any questions
p138
aVor published any story,
p139
aVthat he would be punished for my reporting.
p140
aVWhen I arrived for our visit, the guards reminded me
p141
aVthat they knew who I was and knew about my work.
p142
aVAnd they said that if I attempted to interview McGowan,
p143
aVthe visit would be terminated.
p144
aVThe Bureau of Prisons describes CMUs as "self-contained housing units."
p145
aVBut I think that's an Orwellian way of describing black holes.
p146
aVWhen you visit a CMU,
p147
aVyou go through all the security checkpoints that you would expect.
p148
aVBut then the walk to the visitation room is silent.
p149
aVWhen a CMU prisoner has a visit, the rest of the prison is on lockdown.
p150
aVI was ushered into a small room,
p151
aVso small my outstretched arms could touch each wall.
p152
aVThere was a grapefruit-sized orb in the ceiling
p153
aVfor the visit to be live-monitored by the Counterterrorism Unit
p154
aVin West Virginia.
p155
aVThe unit insists that all the visits have to be in English for CMU prisoners,
p156
aVwhich is an additional hardship for many of the Muslim families.
p157
aVThere is a thick sheet of foggy, bulletproof glass
p158
aVand on the other side was Daniel McGowan.
p159
aVWe spoke through these handsets attached to the wall
p160
aVand talked about books and movies.
p161
aVWe did our best to find reasons to laugh.
p162
aVTo fight boredom and amuse himself while in the CMU,
p163
aVMcGowan had been spreading a rumor that I was secretly the president
p164
aVof a Twilight fan club in Washington, DC
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VFor the record, I'm not.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aVBut I kind of the hope the FBI now thinks that Bella and Edward
p172
aVare terrorist code names.
p173
aa(lp174
V(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
VDuring our visit, McGowan spoke most and at length about his niece Lily,
p177
aVhis wife Jenny and how torturous it feels to never be able to hug them,
p178
aVto never be able to hold their hands.
p179
aVThree months after our visit, McGowan was transferred out of the CMU
p180
aVand then, without warning, he was sent back again.
p181
aVI had published leaked CMU documents on my website
p182
aVand the Counterterrorism Unit said that McGowan had called his wife
p183
aVand asked her to mail them.
p184
aVHe wanted to see what the government was saying about him,
p185
aVand for that he was sent back to the CMU.
p186
aVWhen he was finally released at the end of his sentence,
p187
aVhis story got even more Kafkaesque.
p188
aVHe wrote an article for the Huffington Post headlined,
p189
aV"Court Documents Prove I was Sent to a CMU for my Political Speech."
p190
aa(lp191
VThe next day he was thrown back in jail for his political speech.
p192
aVHis attorneys quickly secured his release,
p193
aVbut the message was very clear:
p194
aVDon't talk about this place.
p195
aa(lp196
VToday, nine years after they were opened by the Bush administration,
p197
aVthe government is codifying how and why CMUs were created.
p198
aVAccording to the Bureau of Prisons,
p199
aVthey are for prisoners with "inspirational significance."
p200
aVI think that is very nice way of saying these are political prisons
p201
aVfor political prisoners.
p202
aa(lp203
VPrisoners are sent to a CMU because of their race,
p204
aVtheir religion or their political beliefs.
p205
aa(lp206
VNow, if you think that characterization is too strong,
p207
aVjust look at some of the government's own documents.
p208
aVWhen some of McGowan's mail was rejected by the CMU, the sender was told
p209
aVit's because the letters were intended "for political prisoners."
p210
aVWhen another prisoner, animal rights activist Andy Stepanian,
p211
aVwas sent to a CMU, it was because of his anti-government and anti-corporate views.
p212
aa(lp213
VNow, I know all of this may be hard to believe,
p214
aVthat it's happening right now, and in the United States.
p215
aVBut the unknown reality is that the US has a dark history
p216
aVof disproportionately punishing people because of their political beliefs.
p217
aVIn the 1960s, before Marion was home to the CMU,
p218
aVit was home to the notorious Control Unit.
p219
aVPrisoners were locked down in solitary for 22 hours a day.
p220
aVThe warden said the unit was to "control revolutionary attitudes."
p221
aVIn the 1980s, another experiment called the Lexington High Security Unit
p222
aVheld women connected to the Weather Underground,
p223
aVBlack Liberation and Puerto Rican independent struggles.
p224
aVThe prison radically restricted communication and used sleep deprivation,
p225
aVand constant light for so-called "ideological conversion."
p226
aVThose prisons were eventually shut down, but only through the campaigning
p227
aVof religious groups and human rights advocates, like Amnesty International.
p228
aa(lp229
VToday, civil rights lawyers with the Center for Constitutional Rights
p230
aVare challenging CMUs in court
p231
aVfor depriving prisoners of their due process rights
p232
aVand for retaliating against them
p233
aVfor their protected political and religious speech.
p234
aVMany of these documents would have never come to light without this lawsuit.
p235
aa(lp236
VThe message of these groups and my message for you today
p237
aVis that we must bear witness to what is being done to these prisoners.
p238
aVTheir treatment is a reflection of the values held beyond prison walls.
p239
aVThis story is not just about prisoners.
p240
aVIt is about us.
p241
aVIt is about our own commitment to human rights.
p242
aVIt is about whether we will choose to stop repeating the mistakes of our past.
p243
aVIf we don't listen to what Father Berrigan described as the stories of the dead,
p244
aVthey will soon become the stories of ourselves.
p245
aa(lp246

aa(lp252
VTom Rielly: I have a couple questions.
p253
aVWhen I was in high school, I learned about the Bill of Rights,
p254
aVthe Constitution, freedom of speech,
p255
aVdue process and  about 25 other laws and rights
p256
aVthat seem to be violated by this.
p257
aVHow could this possibly be happening?
p258
aa(lp259
VWill Potter: I think that's the number one question I get
p260
aVthroughout all of my work,
p261
aVand the short answer is that people don't know.
p262
aVI think the solution to any of these types of situations, any rights abuses,
p263
aVare really dependent on two things.
p264
aVThey're dependent on knowledge that it's actually happening
p265
aVand then a means and efficacy to actually make a change.
p266
aVAnd unfortunately with these prisoners,
p267
aVone, people don't know what's happening at all
p268
aVand then they're already disenfranchised populations
p269
aVwho don't have access to attorneys, not native English speakers.
p270
aVIn some of these cases, they have great representation that I mentioned,
p271
aVbut there's just not a public awareness of what's happening.
p272
aa(lp273
VTR: Isn't it guaranteed in prison that you have right to council
p274
aVor access to council?
p275
aa(lp276
VWP: There's a tendency in our culture
p277
aVto see when people have been convicted of a crime,
p278
aVno matter if that charge was bogus or legitimate,
p279
aVthat whatever happens to them after that is warranted.
p280
aVAnd I think that's a really damaging and dangerous narrative that we have,
p281
aVthat allows these types of things to happen,
p282
aVas the general public just kind of turns a blind eye to it.
p283
aa(lp284
VTR: All those documents on screen were all real documents, word for word,
p285
aVunchanged at all, right?
p286
aa(lp287
VWP: Absolutely. I've actually uploaded all of them to my website.
p288
aVIt's willpotter.com/CMU and it's a footnoted version of the talk,
p289
aVso you can see the documents for yourself without the little snippets.
p290
aVYou can see the full version.
p291
aVI relied overwhelmingly on primary source documents
p292
aVor on primary interviews with former and current prisoners,
p293
aVwith people that are dealing with this situation every day.
p294
aVAnd like I said, I've been there myself, as well.
p295
aa(lp296
VTR: You're doing courageous work.
p297
aa(lp298
