VOn my desk in my office, I keep a small clay pot
p4
aVthat I made in college. It's raku, which is a kind of pottery
p5
aVthat began in Japan centuries ago as a way of
p6
aVmaking bowls for the Japanese tea ceremony.
p7
aVThis one is more than 400 years old.
p8
aVEach one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay,
p9
aVand it was the imperfections that people cherished.
p10
aa(lp11
VEveryday pots like this cup take eight to 10 hours to fire.
p12
aVI just took this out of the kiln last week, and the kiln itself
p13
aVtakes another day or two to cool down, but raku
p14
aVis really fast. You do it outside, and you take the kiln
p15
aVup to temperature. In 15 minutes, it goes to 1,500 degrees,
p16
aVand as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside,
p17
aVyou can see that faint sheen, you turn the kiln off,
p18
aVand you reach in with these long metal tongs,
p19
aVyou grab the pot, and in Japan, this red-hot pot
p20
aVwould be immediately immersed in a solution of green tea,
p21
aVand you can imagine what that steam would smell like.
p22
aVBut here in the United States, we ramp up the drama
p23
aVa little bit, and we drop our pots into sawdust,
p24
aVwhich catches on fire, and you take a garbage pail,
p25
aVand you put it on top, and smoke starts pouring out.
p26
aVI would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke.
p27
aa(lp28
VI love raku because it allows me to play with the elements.
p29
aVI can shape a pot out of clay and choose a glaze,
p30
aVbut then I have to let it go to the fire and the smoke,
p31
aVand what's wonderful is the surprises that happen,
p32
aVlike this crackle pattern, because it's really stressful
p33
aVon these pots. They go from 1,500 degrees
p34
aVto room temperature in the space of just a minute.
p35
aa(lp36
VRaku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity.
p37
aVI find in so many things that tension between
p38
aVwhat I can control and what I have to let go
p39
aVhappens all the time, whether I'm creating a new radio show
p40
aVor just at home negotiating with my teenage sons.
p41
aa(lp42
VWhen I sat down to write a book about creativity,
p43
aVI realized that the steps were reversed.
p44
aVI had to let go at the very beginning, and I had to
p45
aVimmerse myself in the stories of hundreds of artists
p46
aVand writers and musicians and filmmakers, and as I listened
p47
aVto these stories, I realized that creativity
p48
aVgrows out of everyday experiences
p49
aVmore often than you might think, including
p50
aVletting go.
p51
aVIt was supposed to break, but that's okay. (Laughter) (Laughs)
p52
aVThat's part of the letting go, is sometimes it happens
p53
aVand sometimes it doesn't, because creativity also grows
p54
aVfrom the broken places.
p55
aa(lp56
VThe best way to learn about anything
p57
aVis through stories, and so I want to tell you a story
p58
aVabout work and play and about four aspects of life
p59
aVthat we need to embrace
p60
aVin order for our own creativity to flourish.
p61
aVThe first embrace is something that we think,
p62
aV"Oh, this is very easy," but it's actually getting harder,
p63
aVand that's paying attention to the world around us.
p64
aVSo many artists speak about needing to be open,
p65
aVto embrace experience, and that's hard to do when
p66
aVyou have a lighted rectangle in your pocket that
p67
aVtakes all of your focus.
p68
aa(lp69
VThe filmmaker Mira Nair speaks about growing up
p70
aVin a small town in India. Its name is Bhubaneswar,
p71
aVand here's a picture of one of the temples in her town.
p72
aa(lp73
VMira Nair: In this little town, there were like 2,000 temples.
p74
aVWe played cricket all the time. We kind of grew up
p75
aVin the rubble. The major thing that inspired me,
p76
aVthat led me on this path, that made me a filmmaker eventually,
p77
aVwas traveling folk theater that would come through the town
p78
aVand I would go off and see these great battles
p79
aVof good and evil by two people in a school field
p80
aVwith no props but with a lot of, you know,
p81
aVpassion, and hashish as well, and it was amazing.
p82
aVYou know, the folk tales of Mahabharata and Ramayana,
p83
aVthe two holy books, the epics that everything comes out of
p84
aVin India, they say. After seeing that Jatra, the folk theater,
p85
aVI knew I wanted to get on, you know, and perform.
p86
aa(lp87
VJulie Burstein: Isn't that a wonderful story?
p88
aVYou can see the sort of break in the everyday.
p89
aVThere they are in the school fields, but it's good and evil,
p90
aVand passion and hashish. And Mira Nair was a young girl
p91
aVwith thousands of other people watching this performance,
p92
aVbut she was ready. She was ready to open up
p93
aVto what it sparked in her, and it led her,
p94
aVas she said, down this path to become
p95
aVan award-winning filmmaker.
p96
aVSo being open for that experience that might change you
p97
aVis the first thing we need to embrace.
p98
aa(lp99
VArtists also speak about how some of their most powerful work
p100
aVcomes out of the parts of life that are most difficult.
p101
aVThe novelist Richard Ford speaks about
p102
aVa childhood challenge that continues to be something
p103
aVhe wrestles with today. He's severely dyslexic.
p104
aa(lp105
VRichard Ford: I was slow to learn to read, went all the way
p106
aVthrough school not really reading more than the minimum,
p107
aVand still to this day can't read silently
p108
aVmuch faster than I can read aloud,
p109
aVbut there were a lot of benefits to being dyslexic for me
p110
aVbecause when I finally did reconcile myself to how slow
p111
aVI was going to have to do it, then I think I came very slowly
p112
aVinto an appreciation of all of those qualities of language
p113
aVand of sentences that are not just the cognitive
p114
aVaspects of language: the syncopations, the sounds of words,
p115
aVwhat words look like, where paragraphs break,
p116
aVwhere lines break. I mean, I wasn't so badly dyslexic that
p117
aVI was disabled from reading. I just had to do it
p118
aVreally slowly, and as I did, lingering on those sentences
p119
aVas I had to linger, I fell heir to language's other qualities,
p120
aVwhich I think has helped me write sentences.
p121
aa(lp122
VJB: It's so powerful. Richard Ford, who's won the Pulitzer Prize,
p123
aVsays that dyslexia helped him write sentences.
p124
aVHe had to embrace this challenge, and I use that word
p125
aVintentionally. He didn't have to overcome dyslexia.
p126
aVHe had to learn from it. He had to learn to hear the music
p127
aVin language.
p128
aa(lp129
VArtists also speak about how pushing up against
p130
aVthe limits of what they can do, sometimes pushing
p131
aVinto what they can't do, helps them focus
p132
aVon finding their own voice.
p133
aVThe sculptor Richard Serra talks about how,
p134
aVas a young artist, he thought he was a painter,
p135
aVand he lived in Florence after graduate school.
p136
aVWhile he was there, he traveled to Madrid,
p137
aVwhere he went to the Prado to see this picture
p138
aVby the Spanish painter Diego Velázquez.
p139
aVIt's from 1656, and it's called "Las Meninas,"
p140
aVand it's the picture of a little princess
p141
aVand her ladies-in-waiting, and if you look over
p142
aVthat little blonde princess's shoulder, you'll see a mirror,
p143
aVand reflected in it are her parents, the King and Queen
p144
aVof Spain, who would be standing where you might stand
p145
aVto look at the picture.
p146
aVAs he often did, Velázquez put himself in this painting too.
p147
aVHe's standing on the left with his paintbrush in one hand
p148
aVand his palette in the other.
p149
aa(lp150
VRichard Serra: I was standing there looking at it,
p151
aVand I realized that Velázquez was looking at me,
p152
aVand I thought, "Oh. I'm the subject of the painting."
p153
aVAnd I thought, "I'm not going to be able to do that painting."
p154
aVI was to the point where I was using a stopwatch
p155
aVand painting squares out of randomness,
p156
aVand I wasn't getting anywhere. So I went back and dumped
p157
aVall my paintings in the Arno, and I thought, I'm going to just start playing around.
p158
aa(lp159
VJB: Richard Serra says that so nonchalantly, you might
p160
aVhave missed it. He went and saw this painting by a guy
p161
aVwho'd been dead for 300 years, and realized,
p162
aV"I can't do that," and so Richard Serra went back
p163
aVto his studio in Florence, picked up all of his work
p164
aVup to that point, and threw it in a river.
p165
aVRichard Serra let go of painting at that moment,
p166
aVbut he didn't let go of art. He moved to New York City,
p167
aVand he put together a list of verbs
p168
aV\u2014 to roll, to crease, to fold \u2014
p169
aVmore than a hundred of them, and as he said,
p170
aVhe just started playing around. He did these things
p171
aVto all kinds of material. He would take a huge sheet of lead
p172
aVand roll it up and unroll it. He would do the same thing
p173
aVto rubber, and when he got to the direction "to lift,"
p174
aVhe created this, which is in the Museum of Modern Art.
p175
aVRichard Serra had to let go of painting
p176
aVin order to embark on this playful exploration
p177
aVthat led him to the work that he's known for today:
p178
aVhuge curves of steel that require our time and motion
p179
aVto experience. In sculpture,
p180
aVRichard Serra is able to do what he couldn't do in painting.
p181
aVHe makes us the subject of his art.
p182
aVSo experience and challenge
p183
aVand limitations are all things we need to embrace
p184
aVfor creativity to flourish.
p185
aa(lp186
VThere's a fourth embrace, and it's the hardest.
p187
aVIt's the embrace of loss,
p188
aVthe oldest and most constant of human experiences.
p189
aVIn order to create, we have to stand in that space
p190
aVbetween what we see in the world and what we hope for,
p191
aVlooking squarely at rejection, at heartbreak,
p192
aVat war, at death.
p193
aVThat's a tough space to stand in.
p194
aVThe educator Parker Palmer calls it "the tragic gap,"
p195
aVtragic not because it's sad but because it's inevitable,
p196
aVand my friend Dick Nodel likes to say,
p197
aV"You can hold that tension like a violin string
p198
aVand make something beautiful."
p199
aa(lp200
VThat tension resonates in the work of the photographer
p201
aVJoel Meyerowitz, who at the beginning of his career was
p202
aVknown for his street photography, for capturing a moment
p203
aVon the street, and also for his beautiful photographs
p204
aVof landscapes \u2014 of Tuscany, of Cape Cod,
p205
aVof light.
p206
aVJoel is a New Yorker, and his studio for many years
p207
aVwas in Chelsea, with a straight view downtown
p208
aVto the World Trade Center, and he photographed
p209
aVthose buildings in every sort of light.
p210
aVYou know where this story goes.
p211
aVOn 9/11, Joel wasn't in New York. He was out of town,
p212
aVbut he raced back to the city, and raced down to the site
p213
aVof the destruction.
p214
aa(lp215
VJoel Meyerowitz: And like all the other passersby,
p216
aVI stood outside the chain link fence on Chambers
p217
aVand Greenwich, and all I could see was the smoke
p218
aVand a little bit of rubble, and I raised my camera
p219
aVto take a peek, just to see if there was something to see,
p220
aVand some cop, a lady cop, hit me on my shoulder,
p221
aVand said, "Hey, no pictures!"
p222
aVAnd it was such a blow that it woke me up,
p223
aVin the way that it was meant to be, I guess.
p224
aVAnd when I asked her why no pictures, she said,
p225
aV"It's a crime scene. No photographs allowed."
p226
aVAnd I asked her, "What would happen if I was a member
p227
aVof the press?" And she told me,
p228
aV"Oh, look back there," and back a block was the press corps
p229
aVtied up in a little penned-in area,
p230
aVand I said, "Well, when do they go in?"
p231
aVand she said, "Probably never."
p232
aVAnd as I walked away from that, I had this crystallization,
p233
aVprobably from the blow, because it was an insult in a way.
p234
aVI thought, "Oh, if there's no pictures,
p235
aVthen there'll be no record. We need a record."
p236
aVAnd I thought, "I'm gonna make that record.
p237
aVI'll find a way to get in, because I don't want to
p238
aVsee this history disappear."
p239
aa(lp240
VJB: He did. He pulled in every favor he could,
p241
aVand got a pass into the World Trade Center site,
p242
aVwhere he photographed for nine months almost every day.
p243
aVLooking at these photographs today brings back
p244
aVthe smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes
p245
aVwhen I went home to my family at night.
p246
aVMy office was just a few blocks away.
p247
aVBut some of these photographs are beautiful,
p248
aVand we wondered, was it difficult for Joel Meyerowitz
p249
aVto make such beauty out of such devastation?
p250
aa(lp251
VJM: Well, you know, ugly, I mean, powerful
p252
aVand tragic and horrific and everything, but
p253
aVit was also as, in nature, an enormous event
p254
aVthat was transformed after the fact into this residue,
p255
aVand like many other ruins
p256
aV\u2014 you go to the ruins of the Colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace \u2014
p257
aVand they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather.
p258
aVI mean, there were afternoons I was down there,
p259
aVand the light goes pink and there's a mist in the air
p260
aVand you're standing in the rubble, and I found myself
p261
aVrecognizing both the inherent beauty of nature
p262
aVand the fact that nature, as time,
p263
aVis erasing this wound.
p264
aVTime is unstoppable, and it transforms the event.
p265
aVIt gets further and further away from the day,
p266
aVand light and seasons temper it in some way,
p267
aVand it's not that I'm a romantic. I'm really a realist.
p268
aVThe reality is, there's the Woolworth Building
p269
aVin a veil of smoke from the site, but it's now like a scrim
p270
aVacross a theater, and it's turning pink,
p271
aVyou know, and down below there are hoses spraying,
p272
aVand the lights have come on for the evening, and the water
p273
aVis turning acid green because the sodium lamps are on,
p274
aVand I'm thinking, "My God, who could dream this up?"
p275
aVBut the fact is, I'm there, it looks like that,
p276
aVyou have to take a picture.
p277
aa(lp278
VJB: You have to take a picture. That sense of urgency,
p279
aVof the need to get to work, is so powerful in Joel's story.
p280
aVWhen I saw Joel Meyerowitz recently, I told him how much
p281
aVI admired his passionate obstinacy, his determination
p282
aVto push through all the bureaucratic red tape to get to work,
p283
aVand he laughed, and he said, "I'm stubborn,
p284
aVbut I think what's more important
p285
aVis my passionate optimism."
p286
aa(lp287
VThe first time I told these stories, a man in the audience
p288
aVraised his hand and said, "All these artists talk about
p289
aVtheir work, not their art, which has got me thinking about
p290
aVmy work and where the creativity is there,
p291
aVand I'm not an artist." He's right. We all wrestle
p292
aVwith experience and challenge, limits and loss.
p293
aVCreativity is essential to all of us,
p294
aVwhether we're scientists or teachers,
p295
aVparents or entrepreneurs.
p296
aa(lp297
VI want to leave you with another
p298
aVimage of a Japanese tea bowl. This one
p299
aVis at the Freer Gallery in Washington, D.C.
p300
aVIt's more than a hundred years old and you can still see
p301
aVthe fingermarks where the potter pinched it.
p302
aVBut as you can also see, this one did break
p303
aVat some point in its hundred years.
p304
aVBut the person who put it back together,
p305
aVinstead of hiding the cracks,
p306
aVdecided to emphasize them, using gold lacquer to repair it.
p307
aVThis bowl is more beautiful now, having been broken,
p308
aVthan it was when it was first made,
p309
aVand we can look at those cracks, because
p310
aVthey tell the story that we all live,
p311
aVof the cycle of creation and destruction,
p312
aVof control and letting go, of picking up the pieces
p313
aVand making something new.
p314
aVThank you. (Applause)
