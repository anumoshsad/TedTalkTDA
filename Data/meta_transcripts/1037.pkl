VSo today I'm going to talk to you
p4
aVabout the rise of collaborative consumption.
p5
aVI'm going to explain what it is
p6
aVand try and convince you \u2014 in just 15 minutes \u2014
p7
aVthat this isn't a flimsy idea,
p8
aVor a short-term trend,
p9
aVbut a powerful cultural and economic force
p10
aVreinventing not just what we consume,
p11
aVbut how we consume.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow I'm going to start with a deceptively simple example.
p14
aVHands up \u2014 how many of you
p15
aVhave books, CDs, DVDs, or videos
p16
aVlying around your house
p17
aVthat you probably won't use again,
p18
aVbut you can't quite bring yourself to throw away?
p19
aVCan't see all the hands,
p20
aVbut it looks like all of you, right?
p21
aVOn our shelves at home,
p22
aVwe have a box set of the DVD series "24,"
p23
aVseason six to be precise.
p24
aVI think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present.
p25
aVNow my husband, Chris, and I
p26
aVlove this show.
p27
aVBut let's face it, when you've watched it once maybe, or twice,
p28
aVyou don't really want to watch it again,
p29
aVbecause you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists.
p30
aVSo there it sits on our shelves
p31
aVobsolete to us,
p32
aVbut with immediate latent value to someone else.
p33
aVNow before we go on, I have a confession to make.
p34
aVI lived in New York for 10 years,
p35
aVand I am a big fan of "Sex and the City."
p36
aVNow I'd love to watch the first movie again
p37
aVas sort of a warm-up to the sequel coming out next week.
p38
aVSo how easily could I swap
p39
aVour unwanted copy of "24"
p40
aVfor a wanted copy of "Sex and the City?"
p41
aVNow you may have noticed
p42
aVthere's a new sector emerging called swap-trading.
p43
aVNow the easiest analogy for swap-trading
p44
aVis like an online dating service
p45
aVfor all your unwanted media.
p46
aVWhat it does is use the Internet
p47
aVto create an infinite marketplace
p48
aVto match person A's "haves"
p49
aVwith person C's "wants,"
p50
aVwhatever they may be.
p51
aa(lp52
VThe other week, I went on one of these sites,
p53
aVappropriately called Swaptree,
p54
aVand there were over 59,300 items
p55
aVthat I could instantly swap
p56
aVfor my copy of "24."
p57
aVLo and behold,
p58
aVthere in Reseda, CA was Rondoron
p59
aVwho wanted swap his or her
p60
aV"like new" copy of "Sex and the City"
p61
aVfor my copy of "24."
p62
aVSo in other words, what's happening here
p63
aVis that Swaptree
p64
aVsolves my carrying company's sugar rush problem,
p65
aVa problem the economists call "the coincidence of wants,"
p66
aVin approximately 60 seconds.
p67
aVWhat's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot,
p68
aVbecause it knows the way of the item.
p69
aVNow there are layers of technical wonder
p70
aVbehind sites such as Swaptree,
p71
aVbut that's not my interest,
p72
aVand nor is swap trading, per se.
p73
aa(lp74
VMy passion, and what I've spent the last few years
p75
aVdedicated to researching,
p76
aVis the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanics
p77
aVinherent in these systems.
p78
aVWhen you think about it,
p79
aVit would have seemed like a crazy idea, even a few years ago,
p80
aVthat I would swap my stuff with a total stranger
p81
aVwhose real name I didn't know
p82
aVand without any money changing hands.
p83
aVYet 99 percent of trades on Swaptree
p84
aVhappen successfully,
p85
aVand the one percent that receive a negative rating,
p86
aVit's for relatively minor reasons,
p87
aVlike the item didn't arrive on time.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo what's happening here?
p90
aVAn extremely powerful dynamic
p91
aVthat has huge commercial and cultural implications
p92
aVis at play.
p93
aVNamely, that technology
p94
aVis enabling
p95
aVtrust between strangers.
p96
aVWe now live in a global village
p97
aVwhere we can mimic the ties
p98
aVthat used to happen face to face,
p99
aVbut on a scale and in ways
p100
aVthat have never been possible before.
p101
aVSo what's actually happening
p102
aVis that social networks and real-time technologies
p103
aVare taking us back.
p104
aVWe're bartering, trading,
p105
aVswapping, sharing,
p106
aVbut they're being reinvented
p107
aVinto dynamic and appealing forms.
p108
aVWhat I find fascinating
p109
aVis that we've actually wired our world to share,
p110
aVwhether that's our neighborhood, our school,
p111
aVour office, or our Facebook network,
p112
aVand that's creating an economy
p113
aVof "what's mine is yours."
p114
aVFrom the mighty eBay,
p115
aVthe grandfather of exchange marketplaces,
p116
aVto car-sharing companies such as GoGet,
p117
aVwhere you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour,
p118
aVto social lending platforms such as Zopa,
p119
aVthat will take anyone in this audience
p120
aVwith 100 dollars to lend,
p121
aVand match them with a borrower anywhere in the world,
p122
aVwe're sharing and collaborating again
p123
aVin ways that I believe
p124
aVare more hip than hippie.
p125
aVI call this "groundswell collaborative consumption."
p126
aa(lp127
VNow before I dig into the different systems
p128
aVof collaborative consumption,
p129
aVI'd like to try and answer the question
p130
aVthat every author rightfully gets asked,
p131
aVwhich is, where did this idea come from?
p132
aVNow I'd like to say I woke up one morning
p133
aVand said, "I'm going to write about collaborative consumption,"
p134
aVbut actually it was a complicated web
p135
aVof seemingly disconnected ideas.
p136
aVOver the next minute,
p137
aVyou're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display
p138
aVof all the dots that went on in my head.
p139
aVThe first thing I began to notice:
p140
aVhow many big concepts were emerging \u2014
p141
aVfrom the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs \u2014
p142
aVaround how ridiculously easy it is
p143
aVto form groups for a purpose.
p144
aVAnd linked to this crowd mania
p145
aVwere examples all around the world \u2014
p146
aVfrom the election of a president
p147
aVto the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between \u2014
p148
aVon what the power of numbers could achieve.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow, you know when you learn a new word,
p151
aVand then you start to see that word everywhere?
p152
aVThat's what happened to me
p153
aVwhen I noticed that we are moving
p154
aVfrom passive consumers
p155
aVto creators,
p156
aVto highly enabled collaborators.
p157
aVWhat's happening
p158
aVis the Internet is removing the middleman,
p159
aVso that anyone from a T-shirt designer
p160
aVto a knitter
p161
aVcan make a living selling peer-to-peer.
p162
aVAnd the ubiquitous force
p163
aVof this peer-to-peer revolution
p164
aVmeans that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates.
p165
aVI mean, it's amazing to think
p166
aVthat, in every single minute of this speech,
p167
aV25 hours
p168
aVof YouTube video will be loaded.
p169
aVNow what I find fascinating about these examples
p170
aVis how they're actually tapping into
p171
aVour primate instincts.
p172
aVI mean, we're monkeys,
p173
aVand we're born and bred to share and cooperate.
p174
aVAnd we were doing so for thousands of years,
p175
aVwhether it's when we hunted in packs,
p176
aVor farmed in cooperatives,
p177
aVbefore this big system called hyper-consumption came along
p178
aVand we built these fences
p179
aVand created out own little fiefdoms.
p180
aVBut things are changing,
p181
aVand one of the reasons why
p182
aVis the digital natives, or Gen-Y.
p183
aVThey're growing up sharing \u2014
p184
aVfiles, video games, knowledge.
p185
aVIt's second nature to them.
p186
aVSo we, the millennials \u2014 I am just a millennial \u2014
p187
aVare like foot soldiers,
p188
aVmoving us from a culture of "me" to a culture of "we."
p189
aa(lp190
VThe reason why it's happening so fast
p191
aVis because of mobile collaboration.
p192
aVWe now live in a connected age
p193
aVwhere we can locate anyone, anytime, in real-time,
p194
aVfrom a small device in our hands.
p195
aVAll of this was going through my head
p196
aVtowards the end of 2008,
p197
aVwhen, of course, the great financial crash happened.
p198
aVThomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists,
p199
aVand he poignantly commented
p200
aVthat 2008 is when we hit a wall,
p201
aVwhen Mother Nature and the market
p202
aVboth said, "No more."
p203
aVNow we rationally know
p204
aVthat an economy built on hyper-consumption
p205
aVis a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards.
p206
aVYet, it's hard for us to individually know what to do.
p207
aa(lp208
VSo all of this is a lot of twittering, right?
p209
aVWell it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head,
p210
aVuntil actually I realized it was happening
p211
aVbecause of four key drivers.
p212
aVOne, a renewed belief in the importance of community,
p213
aVand a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means.
p214
aVA torrent of peer-to-peer social networks
p215
aVand real-time technologies,
p216
aVfundamentally changing the way we behave.
p217
aVThree, pressing unresolved environmental concerns.
p218
aVAnd four, a global recession
p219
aVthat has fundamentally shocked
p220
aVconsumer behaviors.
p221
aVThese four drivers
p222
aVare fusing together
p223
aVand creating the big shift \u2014
p224
aVaway from the 20th century,
p225
aVdefined by hyper-consumption,
p226
aVtowards the 21st century,
p227
aVdefined by collaborative consumption.
p228
aVI generally believe we're at an inflection point
p229
aVwhere the sharing behaviors \u2014
p230
aVthrough sites such as Flickr and Twitter
p231
aVthat are becoming second nature online \u2014
p232
aVare being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives.
p233
aVFrom morning commutes to the way fashion is designed
p234
aVto the way we grow food,
p235
aVwe are consuming and collaborating once again.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo my co-author, Roo Rogers, and I
p238
aVhave actually gathered thousands of examples
p239
aVfrom all around the world of collaborative consumption.
p240
aVAnd although they vary enormously
p241
aVin scale, maturity and purpose,
p242
aVwhen we dived into them,
p243
aVwe realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems.
p244
aVThe first is redistribution markets.
p245
aVRedistribution markets, just like Swaptree,
p246
aVare when you take a used, or pre-owned, item
p247
aVand move it from where it's not needed
p248
aVto somewhere, or someone, where it is.
p249
aVThey're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' \u2014
p250
aVreduce, reuse, recycle, repair
p251
aVand redistribute \u2014
p252
aVbecause they stretch the life cycle of a product
p253
aVand thereby reduce waste.
p254
aa(lp255
VThe second is collaborative lifestyles.
p256
aVThis is the sharing of resources
p257
aVof things like money, skills and time.
p258
aVI bet, in a couple of years,
p259
aVthat phrases like "coworking"
p260
aVand "couchsurfing" and "time banks"
p261
aVare going to become a part of everyday vernacular.
p262
aVOne of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles
p263
aVis called Landshare.
p264
aVIt's a scheme in the U.K.
p265
aVthat matches Mr. Jones,
p266
aVwith some spare space in his back garden,
p267
aVwith Mrs. Smith, a would-be grower.
p268
aVTogether they grow their own food.
p269
aVIt's one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant,
p270
aVyou wonder why it's never been done before.
p271
aa(lp272
VNow, the third system
p273
aVis product-service systems.
p274
aVThis is where you pay for the benefit of the product \u2014
p275
aVwhat it does for you \u2014
p276
aVwithout needing to own the product outright.
p277
aVThis idea is particularly powerful
p278
aVfor things that have
p279
aVhigh-idling capacity.
p280
aVAnd that can be anything from baby goods
p281
aVto fashions to \u2014
p282
aVhow many of you have a power drill,
p283
aVown a power drill? Right.
p284
aVThat power drill will be used around 12 to 13 minutes
p285
aVin its entire lifetime.
p286
aV(Laughter)
p287
aVIt's kind of ridiculous, right?
p288
aVBecause what you need is the hole, not the drill.
p289
aV(Laughter)
p290
aV(Applause)
p291
aVSo why don't you rent the drill,
p292
aVor, even better, rent out your own drill to other people
p293
aVand make some money from it?
p294
aVThese three systems are coming together,
p295
aVallowing people to share resources
p296
aVwithout sacrificing their lifestyles,
p297
aVor their cherished personal freedoms.
p298
aVI'm not asking people
p299
aVto share nicely in the sandpit.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo I want to just give you an example
p302
aVof how powerful collaborative consumption can be
p303
aVto change behaviors.
p304
aVThe average car
p305
aVcosts 8,000 dollars a year to run.
p306
aVYet, that car sits idle
p307
aVfor 23 hours a day.
p308
aVSo when you consider these two facts,
p309
aVit starts to make a little less sense
p310
aVthat we have to own one outright.
p311
aVSo this is where car-sharing companies
p312
aVsuch as Zipcar and GoGet come in.
p313
aVIn 2009,
p314
aVZipcar took 250 participants
p315
aVfrom across 13 cities \u2014
p316
aVand they're all self-confessed car addicts
p317
aVand car-sharing rookies \u2014
p318
aVand got them to surrender their keys for a month.
p319
aVInstead, these people had to walk,
p320
aVbike, take the train,
p321
aVor other forms of public transport.
p322
aVThey could only use their Zipcar membership
p323
aVwhen absolutely necessary.
p324
aVThe results of this challenge after just one month
p325
aVwas staggering.
p326
aVIt's amazing that 413 lbs were lost
p327
aVjust from the extra exercise.
p328
aVBut my favorite statistic
p329
aVis that 100
p330
aVout of the 250 participants
p331
aVdid not want their keys back.
p332
aVIn other words, the car addicts
p333
aVhad lost their urge to own.
p334
aa(lp335
VNow products-service systems have been around for years.
p336
aVJust think of libraries and laundrettes.
p337
aVBut I think they're entering a new age,
p338
aVbecause technology makes sharing
p339
aVfrictionless and fun.
p340
aVThere's a great quote that was written in the New York Times
p341
aVthat said, "Sharing is to ownership
p342
aVwhat the iPod is to the 8-track,
p343
aVwhat solar power is to the coal mine."
p344
aVI believe also, our generation,
p345
aVour relationship to satisfying what we want
p346
aVis far less tangible
p347
aVthan any other previous generation.
p348
aVI don't want the DVD; I want the movie it carries.
p349
aVI don't want a clunky answering machine;
p350
aVI want the message it saves.
p351
aVI don't want a CD; I want the music it plays.
p352
aVIn other words, I don't want stuff;
p353
aVI want the needs or experiences it fulfills.
p354
aVThis is fueling a massive shift
p355
aVfrom where usage trumps possessions \u2014
p356
aVor as Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, puts it,
p357
aV"where access is better than ownership."
p358
aa(lp359
VNow as our possessions
p360
aVdematerialize into the cloud,
p361
aVa blurry line is appearing
p362
aVbetween what's mine, what's yours,
p363
aVand what's ours.
p364
aVI want to give you one example
p365
aVthat shows how fast this evolution is happening.
p366
aVThis represents an eight-year time span.
p367
aVWe've gone from traditional car-ownership
p368
aVto car-sharing companies, such as Zipcar and GoGet,
p369
aVto ride-sharing platforms that match rides
p370
aVto the newest entry, which is peer-to-peer car rental,
p371
aVwhere you can actually make money
p372
aVout of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day
p373
aVto your neighbor.
p374
aVNow all of these systems
p375
aVrequire a degree of trust,
p376
aVand the cornerstone to this working
p377
aVis reputation.
p378
aa(lp379
VNow in the old consumer system,
p380
aVour reputation didn't matter so much,
p381
aVbecause our credit history was far more important
p382
aVthat any kind of peer-to-peer review.
p383
aVBut now with the Web, we leave a trail.
p384
aVWith every spammer we flag,
p385
aVwith every idea we post, comment we share,
p386
aVwe're actually signaling how well we collaborate,
p387
aVand whether we can or can't be trusted.
p388
aVLet's go back to my first example,
p389
aVSwaptree.
p390
aVI can see that Rondoron
p391
aVhas completed 553 trades
p392
aVwith a 100 percent success rate.
p393
aVIn other words, I can trust him or her.
p394
aVNow mark my words,
p395
aVit's only a matter of time
p396
aVbefore we're going to be able to perform a Google-like search
p397
aVand see a cumulative picture
p398
aVof our reputation capital.
p399
aVAnd this reputation capital
p400
aVwill determine our access to collaborative consumption.
p401
aVIt's a new social currency, so to speak,
p402
aVthat could become as powerful as our credit rating.
p403
aa(lp404
VNow as a closing thought,
p405
aVI believe we're actually in a period
p406
aVwhere we're waking up
p407
aVfrom this humongous hangover
p408
aVof emptiness and waste,
p409
aVand we're taking a leap
p410
aVto create a more sustainable system
p411
aVbuilt to serve our innate needs
p412
aVfor community and individual identity.
p413
aVI believe it will be referred to
p414
aVas a revolution, so to speak \u2014
p415
aVwhen society, faced with great challenges,
p416
aVmade a seismic shift
p417
aVfrom individual getting and spending
p418
aVtowards a rediscovery of collective good.
p419
aVI'm on a mission to make sharing cool.
p420
aVI'm on a mission to make sharing hip.
p421
aVBecause I really believe
p422
aVit can disrupt outdated modes of business,
p423
aVhelp us leapfrog
p424
aVover wasteful forms of hyper-consumption
p425
aVand teach us when enough really is enough.
p426
