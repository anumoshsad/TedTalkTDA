V"Even in purely non-religious terms,
p4
aVhomosexuality represents a misuse of the sexual faculty.
p5
aVIt is a pathetic little second-rate substitute for reality \u2014
p6
aVa pitiable flight from life.
p7
aVAs such, it deserves no compassion,
p8
aVit deserves no treatment
p9
aVas minority martyrdom,
p10
aVand it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness."
p11
aa(lp12
VThat's from Time magazine in 1966, when I was three years old.
p13
aVAnd last year, the president of the United States
p14
aVcame out in favor of gay marriage.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Applause)
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd my question is, how did we get from there to here?
p19
aVHow did an illness become an identity?
p20
aa(lp21
VWhen I was perhaps six years old,
p22
aVI went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother.
p23
aVAnd at the end of buying our shoes,
p24
aVthe salesman said to us that we could each have a balloon to take home.
p25
aVMy brother wanted a red balloon, and I wanted a pink balloon.
p26
aVMy mother said that she thought I'd really rather have a blue balloon.
p27
aVBut I said that I definitely wanted the pink one.
p28
aVAnd she reminded me that my favorite color was blue.
p29
aVThe fact that my favorite color now is blue, but I'm still gay \u2014
p30
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p31
aVis evidence of both my mother's influence and its limits.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
V(Applause)
p36
aa(lp37
VWhen I was little, my mother used to say,
p38
aV"The love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world.
p39
aVAnd until you have children, you don't know what it's like."
p40
aVAnd when I was little, I took it as the greatest compliment in the world
p41
aVthat she would say that about parenting my brother and me.
p42
aVAnd when I was an adolescent, I thought
p43
aVthat I'm gay, and so I probably can't have a family.
p44
aVAnd when she said it, it made me anxious.
p45
aVAnd after I came out of the closet,
p46
aVwhen she continued to say it, it made me furious.
p47
aVI said, "I'm gay. That's not the direction that I'm headed in.
p48
aVAnd I want you to stop saying that."
p49
aa(lp50
VAbout 20 years ago, I was asked by my editors at The New York Times Magazine
p51
aVto write a piece about deaf culture.
p52
aVAnd I was rather taken aback.
p53
aVI had thought of deafness entirely as an illness.
p54
aVThose poor people, they couldn't hear.
p55
aVThey lacked hearing, and what could we do for them?
p56
aVAnd then I went out into the deaf world.
p57
aVI went to deaf clubs.
p58
aVI saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry.
p59
aVI even went to the Miss Deaf America contest in Nashville, Tennessee
p60
aVwhere people complained about that slurry Southern signing.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd as I plunged deeper and deeper into the deaf world,
p65
aVI become convinced that deafness was a culture
p66
aVand that the people in the deaf world who said,
p67
aV"We don't lack hearing, we have membership in a culture,"
p68
aVwere saying something that was viable.
p69
aVIt wasn't my culture,
p70
aVand I didn't particularly want to rush off and join it,
p71
aVbut I appreciated that it was a culture
p72
aVand that for the people who were members of it,
p73
aVit felt as valuable as Latino culture or gay culture or Jewish culture.
p74
aVIt felt as valid perhaps even as American culture.
p75
aa(lp76
VThen a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a dwarf.
p77
aVAnd when her daughter was born,
p78
aVshe suddenly found herself confronting questions
p79
aVthat now began to seem quite resonant to me.
p80
aVShe was facing the question of what to do with this child.
p81
aVShould she say, "You're just like everyone else but a little bit shorter?"
p82
aVOr should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity,
p83
aVget involved in the Little People of America,
p84
aVbecome aware of what was happening for dwarfs?
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd I suddenly thought,
p87
aVmost deaf children are born to hearing parents.
p88
aVThose hearing parents tend to try to cure them.
p89
aVThose deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence.
p90
aVMost gay people are born to straight parents.
p91
aVThose straight parents often want them to function
p92
aVin what they think of as the mainstream world,
p93
aVand those gay people have to discover identity later on.
p94
aVAnd here was this friend of mine
p95
aVlooking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter.
p96
aVAnd I thought, there it is again:
p97
aVA family that perceives itself to be normal
p98
aVwith a child who seems to be extraordinary.
p99
aVAnd I hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity.
p100
aa(lp101
VThere are vertical identities,
p102
aVwhich are passed down generationally from parent to child.
p103
aVThose are things like ethnicity, frequently nationality, language, often religion.
p104
aVThose are things you have in common with your parents and with your children.
p105
aVAnd while some of them can be difficult,
p106
aVthere's no attempt to cure them.
p107
aVYou can argue that it's harder in the United States \u2014
p108
aVour current presidency notwithstanding \u2014
p109
aVto be a person of color.
p110
aVAnd yet, we have nobody who is trying to ensure
p111
aVthat the next generation of children born to African-Americans and Asians
p112
aVcome out with creamy skin and yellow hair.
p113
aa(lp114
VThere are these other identities which you have to learn from a peer group.
p115
aVAnd I call them horizontal identities,
p116
aVbecause the peer group is the horizontal experience.
p117
aVThese are identities that are alien to your parents
p118
aVand that you have to discover when you get to see them in peers.
p119
aVAnd those identities, those horizontal identities,
p120
aVpeople have almost always tried to cure.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd I wanted to look at what the process is
p123
aVthrough which people who have those identities
p124
aVcome to a good relationship with them.
p125
aVAnd it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance
p126
aVthat needed to take place.
p127
aVThere's self-acceptance, there's family acceptance, and there's social acceptance.
p128
aVAnd they don't always coincide.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd a lot of the time, people who have these conditions are very angry
p131
aVbecause they feel as though their parents don't love them,
p132
aVwhen what actually has happened is that their parents don't accept them.
p133
aVLove is something that ideally is there unconditionally
p134
aVthroughout the relationship between a parent and a child.
p135
aVBut acceptance is something that takes time.
p136
aVIt always takes time.
p137
aa(lp138
VOne of the dwarfs I got to know was a guy named Clinton Brown.
p139
aVWhen he was born, he was diagnosed with diastrophic dwarfism,
p140
aVa very disabling condition,
p141
aVand his parents were told that he would never walk, he would never talk,
p142
aVhe would have no intellectual capacity,
p143
aVand he would probably not even recognize them.
p144
aVAnd it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital
p145
aVso that he could die there quietly.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd his mother said she wasn't going to do it.
p148
aVAnd she took her son home.
p149
aVAnd even though she didn't have a lot of educational or financial advantages,
p150
aVshe found the best doctor in the country
p151
aVfor dealing with diastrophic dwarfism,
p152
aVand she got Clinton enrolled with him.
p153
aVAnd in the course of his childhood,
p154
aVhe had 30 major surgical procedures.
p155
aVAnd he spent all this time stuck in the hospital
p156
aVwhile he was having those procedures,
p157
aVas a result of which he now can walk.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd while he was there, they sent tutors around to help him with his school work.
p160
aVAnd he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do.
p161
aVAnd he ended up achieving at a level
p162
aVthat had never before been contemplated by any member of his family.
p163
aVHe was the first one in his family, in fact, to go to college,
p164
aVwhere he lived on campus and drove a specially-fitted car
p165
aVthat accommodated his unusual body.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd his mother told me this story of coming home one day \u2014
p168
aVand he went to college nearby \u2014
p169
aVand she said, "I saw that car, which you can always recognize,
p170
aVin the parking lot of a bar," she said. (Laughter)
p171
aV"And I thought to myself, they're six feet tall, he's three feet tall.
p172
aVTwo beers for them is four beers for him."
p173
aVShe said, "I knew I couldn't go in there and interrupt him,
p174
aVbut I went home, and I left him eight messages on his cell phone."
p175
aVShe said, "And then I thought,
p176
aVif someone had said to me when he was born
p177
aVthat my future worry would be that he'd go drinking and driving with his college buddies \u2014 "
p178
aa(lp179
V(Applause)
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd I said to her, "What do you think you did
p182
aVthat helped him to emerge as this charming, accomplished, wonderful person?"
p183
aVAnd she said, "What did I do? I loved him, that's all.
p184
aVClinton just always had that light in him.
p185
aVAnd his father and I were lucky enough to be the first to see it there."
p186
aa(lp187
VI'm going to quote from another magazine of the '60s.
p188
aVThis one is from 1968 \u2014 The Atlantic Monthly, voice of liberal America \u2014
p189
aVwritten by an important bioethicist.
p190
aVHe said, "There is no reason to feel guilty
p191
aVabout putting a Down syndrome child away,
p192
aVwhether it is put away in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium
p193
aVor in a more responsible, lethal sense.
p194
aVIt is sad, yes \u2014 dreadful. But it carries no guilt.
p195
aVTrue guilt arises only from an offense against a person,
p196
aVand a Down's is not a person."
p197
aa(lp198
VThere's been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we've made
p199
aVin the treatment of gay people.
p200
aVThe fact that our attitude has changed is in the headlines every day.
p201
aVBut we forget how we used to see people who had other differences,
p202
aVhow we used to see people who were disabled,
p203
aVhow inhuman we held people to be.
p204
aVAnd the change that's been accomplished there,
p205
aVwhich is almost equally radical,
p206
aVis one that we pay not very much attention to.
p207
aa(lp208
VOne of the families I interviewed, Tom and Karen Robards,
p209
aVwere taken aback when, as young and successful New Yorkers,
p210
aVtheir first child was diagnosed with Down syndrome.
p211
aVThey thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be,
p212
aVand so they decided they would build a little center \u2014
p213
aVtwo classrooms that they started with a few other parents \u2014
p214
aVto educate kids with D.S.
p215
aVAnd over the years, that center grew into something called the Cooke Center,
p216
aVwhere there are now thousands upon thousands
p217
aVof children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught.
p218
aa(lp219
VIn the time since that Atlantic Monthly story ran,
p220
aVthe life expectancy for people with Down syndrome has tripled.
p221
aVThe experience of Down syndrome people includes those who are actors,
p222
aVthose who are writers, some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood.
p223
aa(lp224
VThe Robards had a lot to do with that.
p225
aVAnd I said, "Do you regret it?
p226
aVDo you wish your child didn't have Down syndrome?
p227
aVDo you wish you'd never heard of it?"
p228
aVAnd interestingly his father said,
p229
aV"Well, for David, our son, I regret it,
p230
aVbecause for David, it's a difficult way to be in the world,
p231
aVand I'd like to give David an easier life.
p232
aVBut I think if we lost everyone with Down syndrome, it would be a catastrophic loss."
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd Karen Robards said to me, "I'm with Tom.
p235
aVFor David, I would cure it in an instant to give him an easier life.
p236
aVBut speaking for myself \u2014 well, I would never have believed 23 years ago when he was born
p237
aVthat I could come to such a point \u2014
p238
aVspeaking for myself, it's made me so much better and so much kinder
p239
aVand so much more purposeful in my whole life,
p240
aVthat speaking for myself, I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world."
p241
aa(lp242
VWe live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions
p243
aVis on the up and up.
p244
aVAnd yet we also live at the moment
p245
aVwhen our ability to eliminate those conditions
p246
aVhas reached a height we never imagined before.
p247
aVMost deaf infants born in the United States now
p248
aVwill receive Cochlear implants,
p249
aVwhich are put into the brain and connected to a receiver,
p250
aVand which allow them to acquire a facsimile of hearing and to use oral speech.
p251
aVA compound that has been tested in mice, BMN-111,
p252
aVis useful in preventing the action of the achondroplasia gene.
p253
aVAchondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism,
p254
aVand mice who have been given that substance and who have the achondroplasia gene,
p255
aVgrow to full size.
p256
aVTesting in humans is around the corner.
p257
aVThere are blood tests which are making progress
p258
aVthat would pick up Down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before,
p259
aVmaking it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregnancies,
p260
aVor to terminate them.
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd so we have both social progress and medical progress.
p263
aVAnd I believe in both of them.
p264
aVI believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful,
p265
aVand I think the same thing about the medical progress.
p266
aVBut I think it's a tragedy when one of them doesn't see the other.
p267
aVAnd when I see the way they're intersecting
p268
aVin conditions like the three I've just described,
p269
aVI sometimes think it's like those moments in grand opera
p270
aVwhen the hero realizes he loves the heroine
p271
aVat the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VWe have to think about how we feel about cures altogether.
p276
aVAnd a lot of the time the question of parenthood is,
p277
aVwhat do we validate in our children,
p278
aVand what do we cure in them?
p279
aa(lp280
VJim Sinclair, a prominent autism activist, said,
p281
aV"When parents say 'I wish my child did not have autism,'
p282
aVwhat they're really saying is 'I wish the child I have did not exist
p283
aVand I had a different, non-autistic child instead.'
p284
aVRead that again. This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence.
p285
aVThis is what we hear when you pray for a cure \u2014
p286
aVthat your fondest wish for us
p287
aVis that someday we will cease to be
p288
aVand strangers you can love will move in behind our faces."
p289
aVIt's a very extreme point of view,
p290
aVbut it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have
p291
aVand they don't want to be cured or changed or eliminated.
p292
aVThey want to be whoever it is that they've come to be.
p293
aa(lp294
VOne of the families I interviewed for this project
p295
aVwas the family of Dylan Klebold who was one of the perpetrators of the Columbine massacre.
p296
aVIt took a long time to persuade them to talk to me,
p297
aVand once they agreed, they were so full of their story
p298
aVthat they couldn't stop telling it.
p299
aVAnd the first weekend I spent with them \u2014 the first of many \u2014
p300
aVI recorded more than 20 hours of conversation.
p301
aa(lp302
VAnd on Sunday night, we were all exhausted.
p303
aVWe were sitting in the kitchen. Sue Klebold was fixing dinner.
p304
aVAnd I said, "If Dylan were here now,
p305
aVdo you have a sense of what you'd want to ask him?"
p306
aVAnd his father said, "I sure do.
p307
aVI'd want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing."
p308
aVAnd Sue looked at the floor, and she thought for a minute.
p309
aVAnd then she looked back up and said,
p310
aV"I would ask him to forgive me for being his mother
p311
aVand never knowing what was going on inside his head."
p312
aa(lp313
VWhen I had dinner with her a couple of years later \u2014
p314
aVone of many dinners that we had together \u2014
p315
aVshe said, "You know, when it first happened,
p316
aVI used to wish that I had never married, that I had never had children.
p317
aVIf I hadn't gone to Ohio State and crossed paths with Tom,
p318
aVthis child wouldn't have existed and this terrible thing wouldn't have happened.
p319
aVBut I've come to feel that I love the children I had so much
p320
aVthat I don't want to imagine a life without them.
p321
aVI recognize the pain they caused to others, for which there can be no forgiveness,
p322
aVbut the pain they caused to me, there is," she said.
p323
aV"So while I recognize that it would have been better for the world
p324
aVif Dylan had never been born,
p325
aVI've decided that it would not have been better for me."
p326
aa(lp327
VI thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems,
p328
aVproblems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid,
p329
aVand that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting.
p330
aVAnd then I thought, all of us who have children
p331
aVlove the children we have, with their flaws.
p332
aVIf some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling
p333
aVand offered to take away the children I have
p334
aVand give me other, better children \u2014 more polite, funnier, nicer, smarter \u2014
p335
aVI would cling to the children I have and pray away that atrocious spectacle.
p336
aVAnd ultimately I feel
p337
aVthat in the same way that we test flame-retardant pajamas in an inferno
p338
aVto ensure they won't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove,
p339
aVso these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences
p340
aVreflect on the universal experience of parenting,
p341
aVwhich is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think,
p342
aVwhere did you come from?
p343
aa(lp344
V(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
VIt turns out that while each of these individual differences is siloed \u2014
p347
aVthere are only so many families dealing with schizophrenia,
p348
aVthere are only so many families of children who are transgender,
p349
aVthere are only so many families of prodigies \u2014
p350
aVwho also face similar challenges in many ways \u2014
p351
aVthere are only so many families in each of those categories \u2014
p352
aVbut if you start to think
p353
aVthat the experience of negotiating difference within your family
p354
aVis what people are addressing,
p355
aVthen you discover that it's a nearly universal phenomenon.
p356
aVIronically, it turns out, that it's our differences, and our negotiation of difference,
p357
aVthat unite us.
p358
aa(lp359
VI decided to have children while I was working on this project.
p360
aVAnd many people were astonished and said,
p361
aV"But how can you decide to have children
p362
aVin the midst of studying everything that can go wrong?"
p363
aVAnd I said, "I'm not studying everything that can go wrong.
p364
aVWhat I'm studying is how much love there can be,
p365
aVeven when everything appears to be going wrong."
p366
aa(lp367
VI thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child I had seen,
p368
aVa severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect.
p369
aVAnd when his ashes were interred, his mother said,
p370
aV"I pray here for forgiveness for having been twice robbed,
p371
aVonce of the child I wanted and once of the son I loved."
p372
aVAnd I figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child
p373
aVif they had the effective will to do so.
p374
aa(lp375
VSo my husband is the biological father of two children
p376
aVwith some lesbian friends in Minneapolis.
p377
aVI had a close friend from college who'd gone through a divorce and wanted to have children.
p378
aVAnd so she and I have a daughter,
p379
aVand mother and daughter live in Texas.
p380
aVAnd my husband and I have a son who lives with us all the time
p381
aVof whom I am the biological father,
p382
aVand our surrogate for the pregnancy was Laura,
p383
aVthe lesbian mother of Oliver and Lucy in Minneapolis.
p384
aa(lp385
V(Applause)
p386
aa(lp387
VSo the shorthand is five parents of four children in three states.
p388
aa(lp389
VAnd there are people who think that the existence of my family
p390
aVsomehow undermines or weakens or damages their family.
p391
aVAnd there are people who think that families like mine
p392
aVshouldn't be allowed to exist.
p393
aVAnd I don't accept subtractive models of love, only additive ones.
p394
aVAnd I believe that in the same way that we need species diversity
p395
aVto ensure that the planet can go on,
p396
aVso we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family
p397
aVin order to strengthen the ecosphere of kindness.
p398
aa(lp399
VThe day after our son was born,
p400
aVthe pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned.
p401
aVHe wasn't extending his legs appropriately.
p402
aVShe said that might mean that he had brain damage.
p403
aVIn so far as he was extending them, he was doing so asymmetrically,
p404
aVwhich she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action.
p405
aVAnd he had a very large head, which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus.
p406
aa(lp407
VAnd as she told me all of these things,
p408
aVI felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor.
p409
aVAnd I thought, here I had been working for years
p410
aVon a book about how much meaning people had found
p411
aVin the experience of parenting children who are disabled,
p412
aVand I didn't want to join their number.
p413
aVBecause what I was encountering was an idea of illness.
p414
aVAnd like all parents since the dawn of time,
p415
aVI wanted to protect my child from illness.
p416
aVAnd I wanted also to protect myself from illness.
p417
aVAnd yet, I knew from the work I had done
p418
aVthat if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for,
p419
aVthat those would ultimately be his identity,
p420
aVand if they were his identity they would become my identity,
p421
aVthat that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded.

aa(lp423
VWe took him to the MRI machine, we took him to the CAT scanner,
p424
aVwe took this day-old child and gave him over for an arterial blood draw.
p425
aVWe felt helpless.
p426
aVAnd at the end of five hours,
p427
aVthey said that his brain was completely clear
p428
aVand that he was by then extending his legs correctly.
p429
aVAnd when I asked the pediatrician what had been going on,
p430
aVshe said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp.

VDuring these 10 years, I had witnessed and learned
p448
aVthe terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility,
p449
aVand I had come to see how it conquers everything else.
p450
aVAnd while I had sometimes thought the parents I was interviewing were fools,
p451
aVenslaving themselves to a lifetime's journey with their thankless children
p452
aVand trying to breed identity out of misery,
p453
aVI realized that day that my research had built me a plank
p454
aVand that I was ready to join them on their ship.
