VFor me, this story begins about 15 years ago,
p4
aVwhen I was a hospice doctor at the University of Chicago.
p5
aVAnd I was taking care of people who were dying and their families
p6
aVin the South Side of Chicago.
p7
aVAnd I was observing what happened to people and their families
p8
aVover the course of their terminal illness.
p9
aVAnd in my lab, I was studying the widower effect,
p10
aVwhich is a very old idea in the social sciences,
p11
aVgoing back 150 years,
p12
aVknown as "dying of a broken heart."
p13
aVSo, when I die, my wife's risk of death can double,
p14
aVfor instance, in the first year.
p15
aVAnd I had gone to take care of one particular patient,
p16
aVa woman who was dying of dementia.
p17
aVAnd in this case, unlike this couple,
p18
aVshe was being cared for
p19
aVby her daughter.
p20
aVAnd the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother.
p21
aVAnd the daughter's husband,
p22
aVhe also was sick
p23
aVfrom his wife's exhaustion.
p24
aVAnd I was driving home one day,
p25
aVand I get a phone call from the husband's friend,
p26
aVcalling me because he was depressed
p27
aVabout what was happening to his friend.
p28
aVSo here I get this call from this random guy
p29
aVthat's having an experience
p30
aVthat's being influenced by people
p31
aVat some social distance.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd so I suddenly realized two very simple things:
p34
aVFirst, the widowhood effect
p35
aVwas not restricted to husbands and wives.
p36
aVAnd second, it was not restricted to pairs of people.
p37
aVAnd I started to see the world
p38
aVin a whole new way,
p39
aVlike pairs of people connected to each other.
p40
aVAnd then I realized that these individuals
p41
aVwould be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby.
p42
aVAnd then, in fact, these people
p43
aVwere embedded in other sorts of relationships:
p44
aVmarriage and spousal
p45
aVand friendship and other sorts of ties.
p46
aVAnd that, in fact, these connections were vast
p47
aVand that we were all embedded in this
p48
aVbroad set of connections with each other.
p49
aVSo I started to see the world in a completely new way
p50
aVand I became obsessed with this.
p51
aVI became obsessed with how it might be
p52
aVthat we're embedded in these social networks,
p53
aVand how they affect our lives.
p54
aVSo, social networks are these intricate things of beauty,
p55
aVand they're so elaborate and so complex
p56
aVand so ubiquitous, in fact,
p57
aVthat one has to ask what purpose they serve.
p58
aVWhy are we embedded in social networks?
p59
aVI mean, how do they form? How do they operate?
p60
aVAnd how do they effect us?
p61
aa(lp62
VSo my first topic with respect to this,
p63
aVwas not death, but obesity.
p64
aVIt had become trendy
p65
aVto speak about the "obesity epidemic."
p66
aVAnd, along with my collaborator, James Fowler,
p67
aVwe began to wonder whether obesity really was epidemic
p68
aVand could it spread from person to person
p69
aVlike the four people I discussed earlier.
p70
aVSo this is a slide of some of our initial results.
p71
aVIt's 2,200 people in the year 2000.
p72
aVEvery dot is a person. We make the dot size
p73
aVproportional to people's body size;
p74
aVso bigger dots are bigger people.
p75
aVIn addition, if your body size,
p76
aVif your BMI, your body mass index, is above 30 \u2014
p77
aVif you're clinically obese \u2014
p78
aVwe also colored the dots yellow.
p79
aVSo, if you look at this image, right away you might be able to see
p80
aVthat there are clusters of obese and
p81
aVnon-obese people in the image.
p82
aVBut the visual complexity is still very high.
p83
aVIt's not obvious exactly what's going on.
p84
aVIn addition, some questions are immediately raised:
p85
aVHow much clustering is there?
p86
aVIs there more clustering than would be due to chance alone?
p87
aVHow big are the clusters? How far do they reach?
p88
aVAnd, most importantly,
p89
aVwhat causes the clusters?
p90
aa(lp91
VSo we did some mathematics to study the size of these clusters.
p92
aVThis here shows, on the Y-axis,
p93
aVthe increase in the probability that a person is obese
p94
aVgiven that a social contact of theirs is obese
p95
aVand, on the X-axis, the degrees of separation between the two people.
p96
aVOn the far left, you see the purple line.
p97
aVIt says that, if your friends are obese,
p98
aVyour risk of obesity is 45 percent higher.
p99
aVAnd the next bar over, the [red] line,
p100
aVsays if your friend's friends are obese,
p101
aVyour risk of obesity is 25 percent higher.
p102
aVAnd then the next line over says
p103
aVif your friend's friend's friend, someone you probably don't even know, is obese,
p104
aVyour risk of obesity is 10 percent higher.
p105
aVAnd it's only when you get to your friend's friend's friend's friends
p106
aVthat there's no longer a relationship
p107
aVbetween that person's body size and your own body size.
p108
aa(lp109
VWell, what might be causing this clustering?
p110
aVThere are at least three possibilities:
p111
aVOne possibility is that, as I gain weight,
p112
aVit causes you to gain weight.
p113
aVA kind of induction, a kind of spread from person to person.
p114
aVAnother possibility, very obvious, is homophily,
p115
aVor, birds of a feather flock together;
p116
aVhere, I form my tie to you
p117
aVbecause you and I share a similar body size.
p118
aVAnd the last possibility is what is known as confounding,
p119
aVbecause it confounds our ability to figure out what's going on.
p120
aVAnd here, the idea is not that my weight gain
p121
aVis causing your weight gain,
p122
aVnor that I preferentially form a tie with you
p123
aVbecause you and I share the same body size,
p124
aVbut rather that we share a common exposure
p125
aVto something, like a health club
p126
aVthat makes us both lose weight at the same time.
p127
aa(lp128
VWhen we studied these data, we found evidence for all of these things,
p129
aVincluding for induction.
p130
aVAnd we found that if your friend becomes obese,
p131
aVit increases your risk of obesity by about 57 percent
p132
aVin the same given time period.
p133
aVThere can be many mechanisms for this effect:
p134
aVOne possibility is that your friends say to you something like \u2014
p135
aVyou know, they adopt a behavior that spreads to you \u2014
p136
aVlike, they say, "Let's go have muffins and beer,"
p137
aVwhich is a terrible combination. (Laughter)
p138
aVBut you adopt that combination,
p139
aVand then you start gaining weight like them.
p140
aVAnother more subtle possibility
p141
aVis that they start gaining weight, and it changes your ideas
p142
aVof what an acceptable body size is.
p143
aVHere, what's spreading from person to person
p144
aVis not a behavior, but rather a norm:
p145
aVAn idea is spreading.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow, headline writers
p148
aVhad a field day with our studies.
p149
aVI think the headline in The New York Times was,
p150
aV"Are you packing it on?
p151
aVBlame your fat friends." (Laughter)
p152
aVWhat was interesting to us is that the European headline writers
p153
aVhad a different take: They said,
p154
aV"Are your friends gaining weight? Perhaps you are to blame."
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aVAnd we thought this was a very interesting comment on America,
p157
aVand a kind of self-serving,
p158
aV"not my responsibility" kind of phenomenon.
p159
aa(lp160
VNow, I want to be very clear: We do not think our work
p161
aVshould or could justify prejudice
p162
aVagainst people of one or another body size at all.
p163
aVOur next questions was:
p164
aVCould we actually visualize this spread?
p165
aVWas weight gain in one person actually spreading
p166
aVto weight gain in another person?
p167
aVAnd this was complicated because
p168
aVwe needed to take into account the fact that the network structure,
p169
aVthe architecture of the ties, was changing across time.
p170
aVIn addition, because obesity is not a unicentric epidemic,
p171
aVthere's not a Patient Zero of the obesity epidemic \u2014
p172
aVif we find that guy, there was a spread of obesity out from him \u2014
p173
aVit's a multicentric epidemic.
p174
aVLots of people are doing things at the same time.
p175
aVAnd I'm about to show you a 30 second video animation
p176
aVthat took me and James five years of our lives to do.
p177
aVSo, again, every dot is a person.
p178
aVEvery tie between them is a relationship.
p179
aVWe're going to put this into motion now,
p180
aVtaking daily cuts through the network for about 30 years.
p181
aa(lp182
VThe dot sizes are going to grow,
p183
aVyou're going to see a sea of yellow take over.
p184
aVYou're going to see people be born and die \u2014
p185
aVdots will appear and disappear \u2014
p186
aVties will form and break, marriages and divorces,
p187
aVfriendings and defriendings.
p188
aVA lot of complexity, a lot is happening
p189
aVjust in this 30-year period
p190
aVthat includes the obesity epidemic.
p191
aVAnd, by the end, you're going to see clusters
p192
aVof obese and non-obese individuals
p193
aVwithin the network.
p194
aVNow, when looked at this,
p195
aVit changed the way I see things,
p196
aVbecause this thing, this network
p197
aVthat's changing across time,
p198
aVit has a memory, it moves,
p199
aVthings flow within it,
p200
aVit has a kind of consistency \u2014
p201
aVpeople can die, but it doesn't die;
p202
aVit still persists \u2014
p203
aVand it has a kind of resilience
p204
aVthat allows it to persist across time.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd so, I came to see these kinds of social networks
p207
aVas living things,
p208
aVas living things that we could put under a kind of microscope
p209
aVto study and analyze and understand.
p210
aVAnd we used a variety of techniques to do this.
p211
aVAnd we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena.
p212
aVWe looked at smoking and drinking behavior,
p213
aVand voting behavior,
p214
aVand divorce \u2014 which can spread \u2014
p215
aVand altruism.
p216
aVAnd, eventually, we became interested in emotions.
p217
aVNow, when we have emotions,
p218
aVwe show them.
p219
aVWhy do we show our emotions?
p220
aVI mean, there would be an advantage to experiencing
p221
aVour emotions inside, you know, anger or happiness.
p222
aVBut we don't just experience them, we show them.
p223
aVAnd not only do we show them, but others can read them.
p224
aVAnd, not only can they read them, but they copy them.
p225
aVThere's emotional contagion
p226
aVthat takes place in human populations.
p227
aVAnd so this function of emotions
p228
aVsuggests that, in addition to any other purpose they serve,
p229
aVthey're a kind of primitive form of communication.
p230
aVAnd that, in fact, if we really want to understand human emotions,
p231
aVwe need to think about them in this way.
p232
aa(lp233
VNow, we're accustomed to thinking about emotions in this way,
p234
aVin simple, sort of, brief periods of time.
p235
aVSo, for example,
p236
aVI was giving this talk recently in New York City,
p237
aVand I said, "You know when you're on the subway
p238
aVand the other person across the subway car
p239
aVsmiles at you,
p240
aVand you just instinctively smile back?"
p241
aVAnd they looked at me and said, "We don't do that in New York City." (Laughter)
p242
aVAnd I said, "Everywhere else in the world,
p243
aVthat's normal human behavior."
p244
aVAnd so there's a very instinctive way
p245
aVin which we briefly transmit emotions to each other.
p246
aVAnd, in fact, emotional contagion can be broader still.
p247
aVLike we could have punctuated expressions of anger,
p248
aVas in riots.
p249
aVThe question that we wanted to ask was:
p250
aVCould emotion spread,
p251
aVin a more sustained way than riots, across time
p252
aVand involve large numbers of people,
p253
aVnot just this pair of individuals smiling at each other in the subway car?
p254
aVMaybe there's a kind of below the surface, quiet riot
p255
aVthat animates us all the time.
p256
aVMaybe there are emotional stampedes
p257
aVthat ripple through social networks.
p258
aVMaybe, in fact, emotions have a collective existence,
p259
aVnot just an individual existence.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd this is one of the first images we made to study this phenomenon.
p262
aVAgain, a social network,
p263
aVbut now we color the people yellow if they're happy
p264
aVand blue if they're sad and green in between.
p265
aVAnd if you look at this image, you can right away see
p266
aVclusters of happy and unhappy people,
p267
aVagain, spreading to three degrees of separation.
p268
aVAnd you might form the intuition
p269
aVthat the unhappy people
p270
aVoccupy a different structural location within the network.
p271
aVThere's a middle and an edge to this network,
p272
aVand the unhappy people seem to be
p273
aVlocated at the edges.
p274
aVSo to invoke another metaphor,
p275
aVif you imagine social networks as a kind of
p276
aVvast fabric of humanity \u2014
p277
aVI'm connected to you and you to her, on out endlessly into the distance \u2014
p278
aVthis fabric is actually like
p279
aVan old-fashioned American quilt,
p280
aVand it has patches on it: happy and unhappy patches.
p281
aVAnd whether you become happy or not
p282
aVdepends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VSo, this work with emotions,
p287
aVwhich are so fundamental,
p288
aVthen got us to thinking about: Maybe
p289
aVthe fundamental causes of human social networks
p290
aVare somehow encoded in our genes.
p291
aVBecause human social networks, whenever they are mapped,
p292
aValways kind of look like this:
p293
aVthe picture of the network.
p294
aVBut they never look like this.
p295
aVWhy do they not look like this?
p296
aVWhy don't we form human social networks
p297
aVthat look like a regular lattice?
p298
aVWell, the striking patterns of human social networks,
p299
aVtheir ubiquity and their apparent purpose
p300
aVbeg questions about whether we evolved to have
p301
aVhuman social networks in the first place,
p302
aVand whether we evolved to form networks
p303
aVwith a particular structure.
p304
aa(lp305
VAnd notice first of all \u2014 so, to understand this, though,
p306
aVwe need to dissect network structure a little bit first \u2014
p307
aVand notice that every person in this network
p308
aVhas exactly the same structural location as every other person.
p309
aVBut that's not the case with real networks.
p310
aVSo, for example, here is a real network of college students
p311
aVat an elite northeastern university.
p312
aVAnd now I'm highlighting a few dots.
p313
aVIf you look here at the dots,
p314
aVcompare node B in the upper left
p315
aVto node D in the far right;
p316
aVB has four friends coming out from him
p317
aVand D has six friends coming out from him.
p318
aVAnd so, those two individuals have different numbers of friends.
p319
aVThat's very obvious, we all know that.
p320
aVBut certain other aspects
p321
aVof social network structure are not so obvious.
p322
aa(lp323
VCompare node B in the upper left to node A in the lower left.
p324
aVNow, those people both have four friends,
p325
aVbut A's friends all know each other,
p326
aVand B's friends do not.
p327
aVSo the friend of a friend of A's
p328
aVis, back again, a friend of A's,
p329
aVwhereas the friend of a friend of B's is not a friend of B's,
p330
aVbut is farther away in the network.
p331
aVThis is known as transitivity in networks.
p332
aVAnd, finally, compare nodes C and D:
p333
aVC and D both have six friends.
p334
aVIf you talk to them, and you said, "What is your social life like?"
p335
aVthey would say, "I've got six friends.
p336
aVThat's my social experience."
p337
aVBut now we, with a bird's eye view looking at this network,
p338
aVcan see that they occupy very different social worlds.
p339
aVAnd I can cultivate that intuition in you by just asking you:
p340
aVWho would you rather be
p341
aVif a deadly germ was spreading through the network?
p342
aVWould you rather be C or D?
p343
aVYou'd rather be D, on the edge of the network.
p344
aVAnd now who would you rather be
p345
aVif a juicy piece of gossip \u2014 not about you \u2014
p346
aVwas spreading through the network? (Laughter)
p347
aVNow, you would rather be C.
p348
aa(lp349
VSo different structural locations
p350
aVhave different implications for your life.
p351
aVAnd, in fact, when we did some experiments looking at this,
p352
aVwhat we found is that 46 percent of the variation
p353
aVin how many friends you have
p354
aVis explained by your genes.
p355
aVAnd this is not surprising. We know that some people are born shy
p356
aVand some are born gregarious. That's obvious.
p357
aVBut we also found some non-obvious things.
p358
aVFor instance, 47 percent in the variation
p359
aVin whether your friends know each other
p360
aVis attributable to your genes.
p361
aVWhether your friends know each other
p362
aVhas not just to do with their genes, but with yours.
p363
aVAnd we think the reason for this is that some people
p364
aVlike to introduce their friends to each other \u2014 you know who you are \u2014
p365
aVand others of you keep them apart and don't introduce your friends to each other.
p366
aVAnd so some people knit together the networks around them,
p367
aVcreating a kind of dense web of ties
p368
aVin which they're comfortably embedded.
p369
aVAnd finally, we even found that
p370
aV30 percent of the variation
p371
aVin whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network
p372
aVcan also be attributed to their genes.
p373
aVSo whether you find yourself in the middle or on the edge
p374
aVis also partially heritable.
p375
aa(lp376
VNow, what is the point of this?
p377
aVHow does this help us understand?
p378
aVHow does this help us
p379
aVfigure out some of the problems that are affecting us these days?
p380
aVWell, the argument I'd like to make is that networks have value.
p381
aVThey are a kind of social capital.
p382
aVNew properties emerge
p383
aVbecause of our embeddedness in social networks,
p384
aVand these properties inhere
p385
aVin the structure of the networks,
p386
aVnot just in the individuals within them.
p387
aVSo think about these two common objects.
p388
aVThey're both made of carbon,
p389
aVand yet one of them has carbon atoms in it
p390
aVthat are arranged in one particular way \u2014 on the left \u2014
p391
aVand you get graphite, which is soft and dark.
p392
aVBut if you take the same carbon atoms
p393
aVand interconnect them a different way,
p394
aVyou get diamond, which is clear and hard.
p395
aVAnd those properties of softness and hardness and darkness and clearness
p396
aVdo not reside in the carbon atoms;
p397
aVthey reside in the interconnections between the carbon atoms,
p398
aVor at least arise because of the
p399
aVinterconnections between the carbon atoms.
p400
aVSo, similarly, the pattern of connections among people
p401
aVconfers upon the groups of people
p402
aVdifferent properties.
p403
aVIt is the ties between people
p404
aVthat makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts.
p405
aVAnd so it is not just what's happening to these people \u2014
p406
aVwhether they're losing weight or gaining weight, or becoming rich or becoming poor,
p407
aVor becoming happy or not becoming happy \u2014 that affects us;
p408
aVit's also the actual architecture
p409
aVof the ties around us.
p410
aa(lp411
VOur experience of the world
p412
aVdepends on the actual structure
p413
aVof the networks in which we're residing
p414
aVand on all the kinds of things that ripple and flow
p415
aVthrough the network.
p416
aVNow, the reason, I think, that this is the case
p417
aVis that human beings assemble themselves
p418
aVand form a kind of superorganism.
p419
aVNow, a superorganism is a collection of individuals
p420
aVwhich show or evince behaviors or phenomena
p421
aVthat are not reducible to the study of individuals
p422
aVand that must be understood by reference to,
p423
aVand by studying, the collective.
p424
aVLike, for example, a hive of bees
p425
aVthat's finding a new nesting site,
p426
aVor a flock of birds that's evading a predator,
p427
aVor a flock of birds that's able to pool its wisdom
p428
aVand navigate and find a tiny speck
p429
aVof an island in the middle of the Pacific,
p430
aVor a pack of wolves that's able
p431
aVto bring down larger prey.
p432
aVSuperorganisms have properties
p433
aVthat cannot be understood just by studying the individuals.
p434
aVI think understanding social networks
p435
aVand how they form and operate
p436
aVcan help us understand not just health and emotions
p437
aVbut all kinds of other phenomena \u2014
p438
aVlike crime, and warfare,
p439
aVand economic phenomena like bank runs
p440
aVand market crashes
p441
aVand the adoption of innovation
p442
aVand the spread of product adoption.
p443
aa(lp444
VNow, look at this.
p445
aVI think we form social networks
p446
aVbecause the benefits of a connected life
p447

aVIf I was always violent towards you
p449
aVor gave you misinformation
p450
aVor made you sad or infected you with deadly germs,

aVyou would cut the ties to me,
p452

aVI think, in fact, that if we realized
p461
aVhow valuable social networks are,
p462
aVwe'd spend a lot more time nourishing them and sustaining them,
p463
aVbecause I think social networks
p464
aVare fundamentally related to goodness.
p465
aVAnd what I think the world needs now
p466
aVis more connections.
