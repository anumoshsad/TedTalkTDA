VSo I want to talk to you about two things tonight.
p4
aVNumber one:
p5
aVTeaching surgery and doing surgery
p6
aVis really hard.
p7
aVAnd second,
p8
aVthat language is one of the most profound things
p9
aVthat separate us all over the world.
p10
aVAnd in my little corner of the world,
p11
aVthese two things are actually related,
p12
aVand I want to tell you how tonight.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow, nobody wants an operation.
p15
aVWho here has had surgery?
p16
aVDid you want it?
p17
aVKeep your hands up if you wanted an operation.
p18
aVNobody wants an operation.
p19
aVIn particular, nobody wants an operation
p20
aVwith tools like these through large incisions
p21
aVthat cause a lot of pain,
p22
aVthat cause a lot of time out of work or out of school,
p23
aVthat leave a big scar.
p24
aVBut if you have to have an operation,
p25
aVwhat you really want is a minimally invasive operation.
p26
aVThat's what I want to talk to you about tonight \u2014
p27
aVhow doing and teaching this type of surgery
p28
aVled us on a search
p29
aVfor a better universal translator.
p30
aa(lp31
VNow, this type of surgery is hard,
p32
aVand it starts by putting people to sleep,
p33
aVputting carbon dioxide in their abdomen,
p34
aVblowing them up like a balloon,
p35
aVsticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen \u2014
p36
aVit's dangerous stuff \u2014
p37
aVand taking instruments and watching it on a TV screen.
p38
aVSo let's see what it looks like.
p39
aVSo this is gallbladder surgery.
p40
aVWe perform a million of these a year
p41
aVin the United States alone.
p42
aVThis is the real thing. There's no blood.
p43
aVAnd you can see how focused the surgeons are,
p44
aVhow much concentration it takes.
p45
aVYou can see it in their faces.
p46
aVIt's hard to teach, and it's not all that easy to learn.
p47
aVWe do about five million of these in the United States
p48
aVand maybe 20 million of these worldwide.
p49
aa(lp50
VAll right, you've all heard the term:
p51
aV"He's a born surgeon."
p52
aVLet me tell you, surgeons are not born.
p53
aVSurgeons are not made either.
p54
aVThere are no little tanks where we're making surgeons.
p55
aVSurgeons are trained one step at a time.
p56
aVIt starts with a foundation, basic skills.
p57
aVWe build on that and we take people, hopefully, to the operating room
p58
aVwhere they learn to be an assistant.
p59
aVThen we teach them to be a surgeon in training.
p60
aVAnd when they do all of that for about five years,
p61
aVthey get the coveted board certification.
p62
aVIf you need surgery, you want to be operated on
p63
aVby a board-certified surgeon.
p64
aVYou get your board certificate,
p65
aVand you can go out into practice.
p66
aVAnd eventually, if you're lucky, you achieve mastery.
p67
aa(lp68
VNow that foundation is so important
p69
aVthat a number of us
p70
aVfrom the largest general surgery society in the United States, SAGES,
p71
aVstarted in the late 1990s a training program
p72
aVthat would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery
p73
aVwould have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills
p74
aVnecessary to go on and do procedures.
p75
aVNow the science behind this is so potent
p76
aVthat it became required by the American Board of Surgery
p77
aVin order for a young surgeon to become board certified.
p78
aVIt's not a lecture, it's not a course,
p79
aVit's all of that plus a high-stakes assessment.
p80
aVIt's hard.
p81
aVNow just this past year,
p82
aVone of our partners, the American College of Surgeons,
p83
aVteamed up with us to make an announcement
p84
aVthat all surgeons should be FLS (Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery)-certified
p85
aVbefore they do minimally invasive surgery.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd are we talking about just people here in the U.S. and Canada?
p88
aVNo, we just said all surgeons.
p89
aVSo to lift this education and training worldwide
p90
aVis a very large task,
p91
aVsomething I'm very personally excited about as we travel around the world.
p92
aVSAGES does surgery all over the world, teaching and educating surgeons.
p93
aVSo we have a problem, and one of the problems is distance.
p94
aVWe can't travel everywhere.
p95
aVWe need to make the world a smaller place.
p96
aVAnd I think that we can develop some tools to do so.
p97
aVAnd one of the tools I like personally is using video.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo I was inspired by a friend.
p100
aVThis is Allan Okrainec from Toronto.
p101
aVAnd he proved
p102
aVthat you could actually teach people to do surgery
p103
aVusing video conferencing.
p104
aVSo here's Allan teaching an English-speaking surgeon in Africa
p105
aVthese basic fundamental skills
p106
aVnecessary to do minimally invasive surgery.
p107
aVVery inspiring.
p108
aVBut for this examination, which is really hard,
p109
aVwe have a problem.
p110
aVEven people who say they speak English,
p111
aVonly 14 percent pass.
p112
aVBecause for them it's not a surgery test,
p113
aVit's an English test.
p114
aa(lp115
VLet me bring it to you locally.
p116
aVI work at the Cambridge Hospital.
p117
aVIt's the primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility.
p118
aVWe have more than 100 translators covering 63 languages,
p119
aVand we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital.
p120
aVIt's a big labor-intensive effort.
p121
aVIf you think about the worldwide burden
p122
aVof trying to talk to your patients \u2014
p123
aVnot just teaching surgeons, just trying to talk to your patients \u2014
p124
aVthere aren't enough translators in the world.
p125
aVWe need to employ technology to assist us in this quest.
p126
aVAt our hospital we see everybody from Harvard professors
p127
aVto people who just got here last week.
p128
aVAnd you have no idea how hard it is
p129
aVto talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can't talk to.
p130
aVAnd there isn't always a translator available.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo we need tools.
p133
aVWe need a universal translator.
p134
aVOne of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk
p135
aVis that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world.
p136
aVIt's really about setting up a dialogue.
p137
aVWe have a lot to learn.
p138
aVHere in the United States we spend more money per person
p139
aVfor outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world.
p140
aVMaybe we have something to learn as well.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo I'm passionate about teaching these FLS skills all over the world.
p143
aVThis past year I've been in Latin America, I've been in China,
p144
aVtalking about the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery.
p145
aVAnd everywhere I go the barrier is:
p146
aV"We want this, but we need it in our language."
p147
aVSo here's what we think we want to do:
p148
aVImagine giving a lecture
p149
aVand being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously.
p150
aVI want to talk to the people in Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe
p151
aVseamlessly, accurately
p152
aVand in a cost-effective fashion using technology.
p153
aVAnd it has to be bi-directional.
p154
aVThey have to be able to teach us something as well.
p155
aa(lp156
VIt's a big task.
p157
aVSo we looked for a universal translator; I thought there would be one out there.
p158
aVYour webpage has translation, your cellphone has translation,
p159
aVbut nothing that's good enough to teach surgery.
p160
aVBecause we need a lexicon. What is a lexicon?
p161
aVA lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain.
p162
aVI need to have a health care lexicon.
p163
aVAnd in that I need a surgery lexicon.
p164
aVThat's a tall order. We have to work at it.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo let me show you what we're doing.
p167
aVThis is research \u2014 can't buy it.
p168
aVWe're working with the folks at IBM Research from the Accessibility Center
p169
aVto string together technologies to work towards the universal translator.
p170
aVIt starts with a framework system
p171
aVwhere when the surgeon delivers the lecture
p172
aVusing a framework of captioning technology,
p173
aVwe then add another technology to do video conferencing.
p174
aVBut we don't have the words yet, so we add a third technology.
p175
aVAnd now we've got the words,
p176
aVand we can apply the special sauce: the translation.
p177
aVWe get the words up in a window and then apply the magic.
p178
aVWe work with a fourth technology.
p179
aVAnd we currently have access to eleven language pairs.
p180
aVMore to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place.
p181
aVAnd I'd like to show you our prototype
p182
aVof stringing all of these technologies that don't necessarily always talk to each other
p183
aVto become something useful.
p184
aa(lp185
VNarrator: Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery.
p186
aVModule five: manual skills practice.
p187
aVStudents may display captions in their native language.
p188
aa(lp189
VSteven Schwaitzberg: If you're in Latin America,
p190
aVyou click the "I want it in Spanish" button
p191
aVand out it comes in real time in Spanish.
p192
aVBut if you happen to be sitting in Beijing at the same time,
p193
aVby using technology in a constructive fashion,
p194
aVyou could get it in Mandarin or you could get it in Russian \u2014
p195
aVon and on and on, simultaneously without the use of human translators.
p196
aVBut that's the lectures.
p197
aa(lp198
VIf you remember what I told you about FLS at the beginning,
p199
aVit's knowledge and skills.
p200
aVThe difference in an operation
p201
aVbetween doing something successfully and not
p202
aVmay be moving your hand this much.
p203
aVSo we're going to take it one step further;
p204
aVwe've brought my friend Allan back.
p205
aa(lp206
VAllan Okrainec: Today we're going to practice suturing.
p207
aVThis is how you hold the needle.
p208
aVGrab the needle at the tip.
p209
aVIt's important to be accurate.
p210
aVAim for the black dots.
p211
aVOrient your loop this way.
p212
aVNow go ahead and cut.
p213
aVVery good Oscar. I'll see you next week.
p214
aa(lp215
VSS: So that's what we're working on
p216
aVin our quest for the universal translator.
p217
aVWe want it to be bi-directional.
p218
aVWe have a need to learn as well as to teach.
p219
aVI can think of a million uses for a tool like this.
p220
aVAs we think about intersecting technologies \u2014
p221
aVeverybody has a cell phone with a camera \u2014
p222
aVwe could use this everywhere,
p223
aVwhether it be health care, patient care,
p224
aVengineering, law, conferencing, translating videos.
p225
aVThis is a ubiquitous tool.
p226
aa(lp227
VIn order to break down our barriers,
p228
aVwe have to learn to talk to people,
p229
aVto demand that people work on translation.
p230
aVWe need it for our everyday life,
p231
aVin order to make the world a smaller place.
p232
aVThank you very much.
