VMy journey to become a polar specialist,
p4
aVphotographing, specializing in the polar regions,
p5
aVbegan when I was four years old,
p6
aVwhen my family moved from southern Canada
p7
aVto Northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland.
p8
aVThere we lived with the Inuit
p9
aVin the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people,
p10
aVwhere [we] were one of three non-Inuit families.
p11
aVAnd in this community, we didn't have a television;
p12
aVwe didn't have computers, obviously, radio.
p13
aVWe didn't even have a telephone.
p14
aVAll of my time was spent outside
p15
aVwith the Inuit, playing.
p16
aVThe snow and the ice were my sandbox,
p17
aVand the Inuit were my teachers.
p18
aVAnd that's where I became
p19
aVtruly obsessed with this polar realm.
p20
aVAnd I knew someday that I was going to do something
p21
aVthat had to do with trying to share news about it
p22
aVand protect it.
p23
aa(lp24
VI'd like to share with you, for just two minutes only,
p25
aVsome images, a cross-section of my work,
p26
aVto the beautiful music by Brandi Carlile, "Have You Ever."
p27
aVI don't know why National Geographic has done this, they've never done this before,
p28
aVbut they're allowing me to show you a few images
p29
aVfrom a coverage that I've just completed that is not published yet.
p30
aVNational Geographic doesn't do this,
p31
aVso I'm very excited to be able to share this with you.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd what these images are \u2014
p34
aVyou'll see them at the start of the slide show \u2014 there's only about four images \u2014
p35
aVbut it's of a little bear that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest.
p36
aVIt's pure white, but it's not a polar bear.
p37
aVIt's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear.
p38
aVThere are only 200 of these bears left.
p39
aVThey're more rare than the panda bear.
p40
aa(lp41
VI sat there on the river for two months without seeing one.
p42
aVI thought, my career's over.
p43
aVI proposed this stupid story to National Geographic.
p44
aVWhat in the heck was I thinking?
p45
aVSo I had two months to sit there
p46
aVand figure out different ways of what I was going to do in my next life,
p47
aVafter I was a photographer, because they were going to fire me.
p48
aVBecause National Geographic is a magazine; they remind us all the time:
p49
aVthey publish pictures, not excuses.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd after two months of sitting there \u2014
p54
aVone day, thinking that it was all over,
p55
aVthis incredible big white male came down,
p56
aVright beside me, three feet away from me,
p57
aVand he went down and grabbed a fish and went off in the forest and ate it.
p58
aVAnd then I spent the entire day living my childhood dream
p59
aVof walking around with this bear through the forest.
p60
aVHe went through this old-growth forest
p61
aVand sat up beside this 400-year-old culturally modified tree and went to sleep.
p62
aVAnd I actually got to sleep within three feet of him,
p63
aVjust in the forest, and photograph him.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo I'm very excited to be able to show you those images
p66
aVand a cross-section of my work that I've done on the polar regions.
p67
aVPlease enjoy.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Music)
p70
aa(lp71
VBrandi Carlile: \u266b Have you ever wandered lonely through the woods? \u266b
p72
aV\u266b And everything there feels just as it should \u266b
p73
aV\u266b You're part of the life there \u266b
p74
aV\u266b You're part of something good \u266b
p75
aV\u266b If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods \u266b
p76
aV\u266b Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh \u266b
p77
aV\u266b If you've ever wandered lonely through the woods \u266b
p78
aV\u266b Have you ever stared into a starry sky? \u266b
p79
aV\u266b Lying on your back, you're asking why \u266b
p80
aV\u266b What's the purpose? \u266b
p81
aV\u266b I wonder, who am I? \u266b
p82
aV\u266b If you've ever stared into a starry sky \u266b
p83
aV\u266b Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh \u266b
p84
aV\u266b Aah, ah, aah \u266b
p85
aV\u266b Ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, oh, oh \u266b
p86
aV\u266b Have you ever stared into a starry sky? \u266b
p87
aV\u266b Have you ever been out walking in the snow? \u266b
p88
aV\u266b Tried to get back where you were before \u266b
p89
aV\u266b You always end up \u266b
p90
aV\u266b Not knowing where to go \u266b
p91
aV\u266b If you've ever been out walking in the snow \u266b
p92
aV\u266b Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh \u266b
p93
aV\u266b Aah, ah, aah, ah, aah \u266b
p94
aV\u266b Ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, oh, ah \u266b
p95
aV\u266b Oh, ah, ah, ah \u266b
p96
aV\u266b Ah, ah, oh, ah, ah, oh, oh \u266b
p97
aV\u266b If you'd ever been out walking you would know \u266b

aa(lp101
VPaul Nicklen: Thank you very much. The show's not over.
p102
aVMy clock is ticking. OK, let's stop.
p103
aVThank you very much. I appreciate it.
p104
aa(lp105
VWe're inundated with news all the time
p106
aVthat the sea ice is disappearing
p107
aVand it's at its lowest level.
p108
aVAnd in fact, scientists were originally saying
p109
aVsea ice is going to disappear in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years.
p110
aVNow they're saying the sea ice in the Arctic,
p111
aVthe summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years.
p112
aVAnd what does that mean?
p113
aVAfter a while of reading this in the news, it just becomes news.
p114
aVYou glaze over with it.
p115
aVAnd what I'm trying to do with my work is put faces to this.
p116
aVAnd I want people to understand and get the concept
p117
aVthat, if we lose ice,
p118
aVwe stand to lose an entire ecosystem.
p119
aVProjections are that we could lose polar bears, they could become extinct
p120
aVin the next 50 to 100 years.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd there's no better, sexier,
p123
aVmore beautiful, charismatic megafauna species
p124
aVfor me to hang my campaign on.
p125
aVPolar bears are amazing hunters.
p126
aVThis was a bear I sat with for a while on the shores.
p127
aVThere was no ice around.
p128
aVBut this glacier caved into the water and a seal got on it.
p129
aVAnd this bear swam out to that seal \u2014
p130
aV800 lb. bearded seal \u2014
p131
aVgrabbed it, swam back and ate it.
p132
aVAnd he was so full, he was so happy and so fat eating this seal,
p133
aVthat, as I approached him \u2014
p134
aVabout 20 feet away \u2014 to get this picture,
p135
aVhis only defense was to keep eating more seal.
p136
aVAnd as he ate, he was so full \u2014
p137
aVhe probably had about 200 lbs of meat in his belly \u2014
p138
aVand as he ate inside one side of his mouth,
p139
aVhe was regurgitating out the other side of his mouth.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo as long as these bears have any bit of ice they will survive,
p142
aVbut it's the ice that's disappearing.
p143
aVWe're finding more and more dead bears in the Arctic.
p144
aVWhen I worked on polar bears as a biologist 20 years ago,
p145
aVwe never found dead bears.
p146
aVAnd in the last four or five years,
p147
aVwe're finding dead bears popping up all over the place.
p148
aVWe're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea,
p149
aVfloating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out.
p150
aVI found a couple in Norway last year. We're seeing them on the ice.
p151
aVThese bears are already showing signs
p152
aVof the stress of disappearing ice.
p153
aa(lp154
VHere's a mother and her two year-old cub
p155
aVwere traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere,
p156
aVand they're riding on this big piece of glacier ice,
p157
aVwhich is great for them; they're safe at this point.
p158
aVThey're not going to die of hypothermia.
p159
aVThey're going to get to land.
p160
aVBut unfortunately, 95 percent of the glaciers in the Arctic
p161
aVare also receding right now
p162
aVto the point that the ice is ending up on land
p163
aVand not injecting any ice back into the ecosystem.
p164
aa(lp165
VThese ringed seals, these are the "fatsicles" of the Arctic.
p166
aVThese little, fat dumplings,
p167
aV150-pound bundles of blubber
p168
aVare the mainstay of the polar bear.
p169
aVAnd they're not like the harbor seals that you have here.
p170
aVThese ringed seals also live out their entire life cycle
p171
aVassociated and connected to sea ice.
p172
aVThey give birth inside the ice,
p173
aVand they feed on the Arctic cod that live under the ice.
p174
aVAnd here's a picture of sick ice.
p175
aVThis is a piece of multi-year ice that's 12 years old.
p176
aVAnd what scientists didn't predict is that, as this ice melts,
p177
aVthese big pockets of black water are forming
p178
aVand they're grabbing the sun's energy
p179
aVand accelerating the melting process.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea.
p182
aVThe visibility's 600 ft.; we're on our safety lines;
p183
aVthe ice is moving all over the place.
p184
aVI wish I could spend half an hour telling you
p185
aVabout how we almost died on this dive.
p186
aVBut what's important in this picture is that you have a piece of multi-year ice,
p187
aVthat big chunk of ice up in the corner.
p188
aVIn that one single piece of ice,
p189
aVyou have 300 species of microorganisms.
p190
aVAnd in the spring, when the sun returns to the ice,
p191
aVit forms the phytoplankton, grows under that ice,
p192
aVand then you get bigger sheets of seaweed,
p193
aVand then you get the zooplankton feeding on all that life.
p194
aVSo really what the ice does
p195
aVis it acts like a garden.
p196
aVIt acts like the soil in a garden. It's an inverted garden.
p197
aVLosing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden.
p198
aa(lp199
VHere's me in my office.
p200
aVI hope you appreciate yours.
p201
aVThis is after an hour under the ice.
p202
aVI can't feel my lips; my face is frozen;
p203
aVI can't feel my hands; I can't feel my feet.
p204
aVAnd I've come up, and all I wanted to do was get out of the water.
p205
aVAfter an hour in these conditions,
p206
aVit's so extreme that, when I go down,
p207
aValmost every dive I vomit into my regulator
p208
aVbecause my body can't deal with the stress of the cold on my head.
p209
aVAnd so I'm just so happy that the dive is over.
p210
aVI get to hand my camera to my assistant,
p211
aVand I'm looking up at him, and I'm going, "Woo. Woo. Woo."
p212
aVWhich means, "Take my camera."
p213
aVAnd he thinks I'm saying, "Take my picture."
p214
aVSo we had this little communication breakdown.
p215
aV(Laughter)
p216
aVBut it's worth it.
p217
aa(lp218
VI'm going to show you pictures of beluga whales, bowhead whales,
p219
aVand narwhals, and polar bears, and leopard seals today,
p220
aVbut this picture right here means more to me than any other I've ever made.
p221
aVI dropped down in this ice hole, just through that hole that you just saw,
p222
aVand I looked up under the underside of the ice,
p223
aVand I was dizzy; I thought I had vertigo.
p224
aVI got very nervous \u2014 no rope, no safety line,
p225
aVthe whole world is moving around me \u2014
p226
aVand I thought, "I'm in trouble."
p227
aVBut what happened is that the entire underside
p228
aVwas full of these billions of amphipods and copepods
p229
aVmoving around and feeding on the underside of the ice,
p230
aVgiving birth and living out their entire life cycle.
p231
aVThis is the foundation of the whole food chain in the Arctic, right here.
p232
aVAnd when you have low  productivity in this, in ice,
p233
aVthe productivity in copepods go down.
p234
aa(lp235
VThis is a bowhead whale.
p236
aVSupposedly, science is stating
p237
aVthat it could be the oldest living animal on earth right now.
p238
aVThis very whale right here could be over 250 years old.
p239
aVThis whale could have been born
p240
aVaround the start of the Industrial Revolution.
p241
aVIt could have survived 150 years of whaling.
p242
aVAnd now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the North
p243
aVbecause of the lives that we're leading in the South.
p244
aa(lp245
VNarwhals, these majestic narwhals
p246
aVwith their eight-foot long ivory tusks, don't have to be here;
p247
aVthey could be out on the open water.
p248
aVBut they're forcing themselves to come up in these tiny little ice holes
p249
aVwhere they can breathe, catch a breath,
p250
aVbecause right under that ice are all the swarms of cod.
p251
aVAnd the cod are there
p252
aVbecause they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods.
p253
aa(lp254
VAlright, my favorite part.
p255
aVWhen I'm on my deathbed,
p256
aVI'm going to remember one story more than any other.
p257
aVEven though that spirit bear moment was powerful,
p258
aVI don't think I'll ever have another experience
p259
aVlike I did with these leopard seals.
p260
aVLeopard seals, since the time of Shackleton, have had a bad reputation.
p261
aVThey've got that wryly smile on their mouth.
p262
aVThey've got those black sinister eyes
p263
aVand those spots on their body.
p264
aVThey look positively prehistoric and a bit scary.
p265
aVAnd tragically in [2003],
p266
aVa scientist was taken down and drowned,
p267
aVand she was being consumed by a leopard seal.
p268
aVAnd people were like, "We knew they were vicious. We knew they were."
p269
aVAnd so people love to form their opinions.
p270
aVAnd that's when I got a story idea:
p271
aVI want to go to Antarctica,
p272
aVget in the water with as many leopard seals as I possibly can
p273
aVand give them a fair shake \u2014
p274
aVfind out if they really are these vicious animals, or if they're misunderstood.
p275
aVSo this is that story.
p276
aVOh, and they also happen to eat Happy Feet.
p277
aa(lp278
V(Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
VAs a species, as humans, we like to say penguins are really cute,
p281
aVtherefore, leopard seals eat them, so leopard seals are ugly and bad.
p282
aVIt doesn't work that way.
p283
aVThe penguin doesn't know it's cute,
p284
aVand the leopard seal doesn't know it's kind of big and monstrous.
p285
aVThis is just the food chain unfolding.
p286
aVThey're also big.
p287
aVThey're not these little harbor seals.
p288
aVThey are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds.
p289
aVAnd they're also curiously aggressive.
p290
aVYou get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac,
p291
aVfloating in these icy waters,
p292
aVand a leopard seal comes up and bites the pontoon.
p293
aVThe boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship
p294
aVand get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked.
p295
aVAll the leopard seal was doing \u2014
p296
aVit's just biting a balloon.
p297
aVIt just sees this big balloon in the ocean \u2014 it doesn't have hands \u2014
p298
aVit's going to take a little bite, the boat pops, and off they go.
p299
aa(lp300
V(Laughter)
p301
aa(lp302
VSo after five days of crossing the Drake Passage \u2014
p303
aVisn't that beautiful \u2014
p304
aVafter five days of crossing the Drake Passage,
p305
aVwe have finally arrived at Antarctica.
p306
aVI'm with my Swedish assistant and guide.
p307
aVHis name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden \u2014 Goran.
p308
aVAnd he has a lot of experience with leopard seals. I have never seen one.
p309
aVSo we come around the cove in our little Zodiac boat,
p310
aVand there's this monstrous leopard seal.
p311
aVAnd even in his voice, he goes, "That's a bloody big seal, ya."
p312
aV(Laughter)
p313
aVAnd this seal is taking this penguin by the head,
p314
aVand it's flipping it back and forth.
p315
aVAnd what it's trying to do is turn that penguin inside-out,
p316
aVso it can eat the meat off the bones,
p317
aVand then it goes off and gets another one.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd so this leopard seal grabbed another penguin,
p320
aVcame under the boat, the Zodiac,
p321
aVstarting hitting the hull of the boat.
p322
aVAnd we're trying to not fall in the water.
p323
aVAnd we sit down, and that's when Goran said to me,
p324
aV"This is a good seal, ya.
p325
aVIt's time for you to get in the water."
p326
aV(Laughter)
p327
aVAnd I looked at Goran, and I said to him, "Forget that."
p328
aVBut I think I probably used a different word starting with the letter "F."
p329
aVBut he was right.
p330
aVHe scolded me out, and said, "This is why we're here.
p331
aVAnd you purposed this stupid story to National Geographic.
p332
aVAnd now you've got to deliver.
p333
aVAnd you can't publish excuses."
p334
aa(lp335
VSo I had such dry mouth \u2014
p336
aVprobably not as bad as now \u2014
p337
aVbut I had such, such dry mouth.
p338
aVAnd my legs were just trembling. I couldn't feel my legs.
p339
aVI put my flippers on. I could barely part my lips.
p340
aVI put my snorkel in my mouth,
p341
aVand I rolled over the side of the Zodiac into the water.
p342
aVAnd this was the first thing she did.
p343
aVShe came racing up to me, engulfed my whole camera \u2014
p344
aVand her teeth are up here and down here \u2014
p345
aVbut Goran, before I had gotten in the water, had given me amazing advice.
p346
aVHe said, "If you get scared, you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."
p347
aa(lp348
V(Laughter)
p349
aa(lp350
VSo that's all I had to work with at that point.
p351
aVBut I just started to shoot these pictures.
p352
aVSo she did this threat display for a few minutes,
p353
aVand then the most amazing thing happened \u2014 she totally relaxed.
p354
aVShe went off, she got a penguin.
p355
aVShe stopped about 10 feet away from me,
p356
aVand she sat there with this penguin, the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go.
p357
aVThe penguin swims toward me, takes off.
p358
aVShe grabs another one. She does this over and over.
p359
aVAnd it dawned on me that she's trying to feed me a penguin.
p360
aVWhy else would she release these penguins at me?
p361
aVAnd after she did this four or five times,
p362
aVshe swam by me with this dejected look on her face.
p363
aVYou don't want to be too anthropomorphic, but I swear that she looked at me
p364
aVlike, "This useless predator's going to starve in my ocean."
p365
aa(lp366
V(Laughter)
p367
aa(lp368
VSo realizing I couldn't catch swimming penguins,
p369
aVshe'd get these other penguins and bring them slowly towards me,
p370
aVbobbing like this, and she'd let them go.
p371
aVThis didn't work.
p372
aVI was laughing so hard and so emotional
p373
aVthat my mask was flooding, because I was crying underwater,
p374
aVjust because it was so amazing.
p375
aVAnd so that didn't work.
p376
aVSo then she'd get another penguin and try this ballet-like sexy display
p377
aVsliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter)
p378
aVAnd she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me.
p379
aVThis went on for four days.
p380
aVThis just didn't happen a couple of times.
p381
aVAnd then so she realized I couldn't catch live ones,
p382
aVso she brought me dead penguins.
p383
aV(Laughter)
p384
aVNow I've got four or five penguins floating around my head,
p385
aVand I'm just sitting there shooting away.
p386
aVAnd she would often stop and have this dejected look on her face
p387
aVlike, "Are you for real?"
p388
aVBecause she can't believe I can't eat this penguin.
p389
aVBecause in her world, you're either breeding or you're eating \u2014
p390
aVand I'm not breeding, so ...
p391
aa(lp392
V(Laughter)
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd then that wasn't enough; she started to flip penguins onto my head.
p395
aVShe was trying to force-feed me. She's pushing me around.
p396
aVShe's trying to force-feed my camera,
p397
aVwhich is every photographer's dream.
p398
aVAnd she would get frustrated; she'd blow bubbles in my face.
p399
aVShe would, I think, let me know that I was going to starve.
p400
aVBut yet she didn't stop.
p401
aVShe would not stop trying to feed me penguins.
p402
aa(lp403
VAnd on the last day with this female
p404
aVwhere I thought I had pushed her too far,
p405
aVI got nervous because she came up to me,
