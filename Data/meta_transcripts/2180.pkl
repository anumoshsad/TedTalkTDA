VI'm an artist and I cut books.
p4
aVThis is one of my first book works.
p5
aVIt's called "Alternate Route to Knowledge."
p6
aVI wanted to create a stack of books so that somebody could come into the gallery
p7
aVand think they're just looking at a regular stack of books,
p8
aVbut then as they got closer they would see this rough hole carved into it,
p9
aVand wonder what was happening, wonder why,
p10
aVand think about the material of the book.
p11
aVSo I'm interested in the texture,
p12
aVbut I'm more interested in the text and the images that we find within books.
p13
aa(lp14
VIn most of my work, what I do is I seal the edges of a book with a thick varnish
p15
aVso it's creating sort of a skin on the outside of the book
p16
aVso it becomes a solid material, but then the pages inside are still loose,
p17
aVand then I carve into the surface of the book,
p18
aVand I'm not moving or adding anything.
p19
aVI'm just carving around whatever I find interesting.
p20
aVSo everything you see within the finished piece
p21
aVis exactly where it was in the book before I began.
p22
aa(lp23
VI think of my work as sort of a remix, in a way,
p24
aVbecause I'm working with somebody else's material
p25
aVin the same way that a D.J. might be working with somebody else's music.
p26
aVThis was a book of Raphael paintings, the Renaissance artist,
p27
aVand by taking his work and remixing it, carving into it,
p28
aVI'm sort of making it into something that's more new and more contemporary.
p29
aVI'm thinking also about breaking out of the box of the traditional book
p30
aVand pushing that linear format,
p31
aVand try to push the structure of the book itself
p32
aVso that the book can become fully sculptural.
p33
aa(lp34
VI'm using clamps and ropes and all sorts of materials, weights,
p35
aVin order to hold things  in place before I varnish
p36
aVso that I can push the form  before I begin,
p37
aVso that something like this can become a piece like this,
p38
aVwhich is just made from a single dictionary.
p39
aVOr something like this can become a piece like this.
p40
aVOr something like this,
p41
aVwhich who knows what that's going to be or why that's in my studio,
p42
aVwill become a piece like this.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo I think one of the reasons people are disturbed by destroying books,
p45
aVpeople don't want to rip books
p46
aVand nobody really wants to throw away a book,
p47
aVis that we think about books as living things,
p48
aVwe think about them as a body,
p49
aVand they're created to relate to our body, as far as scale,
p50
aVbut they also have the potential to continue to grow
p51
aVand to continue to become new things.
p52
aVSo books really are alive.
p53
aVSo I think of the book as a body,
p54
aVand I think of the book as a technology.
p55
aVI think of the book as a tool.
p56
aVAnd I also think of the book as a machine.
p57
aVI also think of the book as a landscape.
p58
aVThis is a full set of encyclopedias that's been connected and sanded together,
p59
aVand as I carve through it,
p60
aVI'm deciding what I want to choose.
p61
aVSo with encyclopedias, I could have chosen anything,
p62
aVbut I specifically chose images of landscapes.
p63
aVAnd with the material itself, I'm using sandpaper
p64
aVand sanding the edges so not only the images suggest landscape,
p65
aVbut the material itself suggests a landscape as well.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo one of the things I do is when I'm carving through the book,
p68
aVI'm thinking about images, but I'm also thinking about text,
p69
aVand I think about them in a very similar way,
p70
aVbecause what's interesting is that when we're reading text,
p71
aVwhen we're reading a book,
p72
aVit puts images in our head,
p73
aVso we're sort of filling that piece.
p74
aVWe're sort of creating images when we're reading text,
p75
aVand when we're looking at an image, we actually use language
p76
aVin order to understand what we're looking at.
p77
aVSo there's sort of a yin-yang that happens,
p78
aVsort of a flip flop.
p79
aVSo I'm creating a piece that the viewer is completing themselves.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd I think of my work as almost an archaeology.
p82
aVI'm excavating and I'm trying to maximize the potential
p83
aVand discover as much as I possibly can
p84
aVand exposing it within my own work.
p85
aVBut at the same time,
p86
aVI'm thinking about this idea of erasure,
p87
aVand what's happening now that most of our information is intangible,
p88
aVand this idea of loss,
p89
aVand this idea that not only is the format constantly shifting within computers,
p90
aVbut the information itself,
p91
aVnow that we don't have a physical backup,
p92
aVhas to be constantly updated in order to not lose it.
p93
aVAnd I have several dictionaries in my own studio,
p94
aVand I do use a computer every day,
p95
aVand if I need to look up a word, I'll go on the computer,
p96
aVbecause I can go directly and instantly to what I'm looking up.
p97
aVI think that the book was never really
p98
aVthe right format for nonlinear information,
p99
aVwhich is why we're seeing reference books
p100
aVbecoming the first to be  endangered or extinct.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo I don't think that the book will ever really die.
p103
aVPeople think that now that we have digital technology,
p104
aVthe book is going to die,
p105
aVand we are seeing things shifting and things evolving.
p106
aVI think that the book will evolve,
p107
aVand just like people said painting would die
p108
aVwhen photography and printmaking became everyday materials,
p109
aVbut what it really allowed painting to do
p110
aVwas it allowed painting to quit its day job.
p111
aVIt allowed painting to not have to have that everyday chore of telling the story,
p112
aVand painting became free and was allowed to tell its own story,
p113
aVand that's when we saw Modernism emerge,
p114
aVand we saw painting go into different branches.
p115
aVAnd I think that's what's happening with books now,
p116
aVnow that most of our technology, most of our information,
p117
aVmost of our personal and cultural  records are in digital form,
p118
aVI think it's really allowing the book to become something new.
p119
aVSo I think it's a very exciting time for an artist like me,
p120
aVand it's very exciting to see what will happen with the book in the future.
