VTrees epitomize stasis.
p4
aVTrees are rooted in the ground in one place
p5
aVfor many human generations,
p6
aVbut if we shift our perspective
p7
aVfrom the trunk to the twigs,
p8
aVtrees become very dynamic entities,
p9
aVmoving and growing.
p10
aVAnd I decided to explore this movement
p11
aVby turning trees into artists.
p12
aVI simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig.
p13
aVI waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas,
p14
aVand that produced art.
p15
aVThe piece of art you see on your left
p16
aVis painted by a western red cedar
p17
aVand that on your right by a Douglas fir,
p18
aVand what I learned was that different species
p19
aVhave different signatures, like a Picasso versus a Monet.
p20
aa(lp21
VBut I was also interested in the movement of trees
p22
aVand how this art might let me capture that and quantify it,
p23
aVso to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree \u2014
p24
aVwhich produced this painting \u2014 moved in a single year,
p25
aVI simply measured and summed
p26
aVeach of those lines.
p27
aVI multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch
p28
aVand the number of branches per tree
p29
aVand then divided that by the number of minutes per year.
p30
aVAnd so I was able to calculate
p31
aVhow far a single tree moved in a single year.
p32
aVYou might have a guess.
p33
aVThe answer is actually 186,540 miles,
p34
aVor seven times around the globe.
p35
aVAnd so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk
p36
aVto the many dynamic twigs,
p37
aVwe are able to see that trees are not simply static entities,
p38
aVbut rather extremely dynamic.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd I began to think about ways that
p41
aVwe might consider this lesson of trees,
p42
aVto consider other entities that are also static and stuck,
p43
aVbut which cry for change and dynamicism,
p44
aVand one of those entities is our prisons.
p45
aVPrisons, of course, are where people who break our laws
p46
aVare stuck, confined behind bars.
p47
aVAnd our prison system itself is stuck.
p48
aVThe United States has over 2.3 million
p49
aVincarcerated men and women.
p50
aVThat number is rising.
p51
aVOf the 100 incarcerated people that are released,
p52
aV60 will return to prison.
p53
aVFunds for education, for training
p54
aVand for rehabilitation are declining,
p55
aVso this despairing cycle of incarceration continues.
p56
aVI decided to ask whether the lesson
p57
aVI had learned from trees as artists
p58
aVcould be applied to a static institution
p59
aVsuch as our prisons,
p60
aVand I think the answer is yes.
p61
aa(lp62
VIn the year 2007,
p63
aVI started a partnership
p64
aVwith the Washington State Department of Corrections.
p65
aVWorking with four prisons, we began bringing science and scientists,
p66
aVsustainability and conservation projects
p67
aVto four state prisons.
p68
aVWe give science lectures,
p69
aVand the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures
p70
aVinstead of watching television or weightlifting.
p71
aVThat, I think, is movement.
p72
aVWe partnered with the Nature Conservancy
p73
aVfor inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center
p74
aVto grow endangered prairie plants
p75
aVfor restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state.
p76
aVThat, I think, is movement.
p77
aVWe worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife
p78
aVto grow endangered frogs \u2014 the Oregon spotted frog \u2014
p79
aVfor later release into protected wetlands.
p80
aVThat, I think, is movement.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd just recently, we've begun to work with
p83
aVthose men who are segregated
p84
aVin what we call Supermax facilities.
p85
aVThey've incurred violent infractions
p86
aVby becoming violent with guards
p87
aVand with other prisoners.
p88
aVThey're kept in bare cells like this
p89
aVfor 23 hours a day.
p90
aVWhen they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals,
p91
aVthey're placed in immobile booths like this.
p92
aVFor one hour a day
p93
aVthey're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards.
p94
aVAlthough we can't bring trees and prairie plants
p95
aVand frogs into these environments,
p96
aVwe are bringing images of nature
p97
aVinto these exercise yards,
p98
aVputting them on the walls, so at least they get contact
p99
aVwith visual images of nature.
p100
aVThis is Mr. Lopez, who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months,
p101
aVand he's providing input on the types of images
p102
aVthat he believes would make him and his fellow inmates
p103
aVmore serene, more calm,
p104
aVless apt to violence.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd so what we see, I think,
p107
aVis that small, collective movements of change
p108
aVcan perhaps move
p109
aVan entity such as our own prison system
p110
aVin a direction of hope.
p111
aVWe know that trees are static entities
p112
aVwhen we look at their trunks.
p113
aVBut if trees can create art,
p114
aVif they can encircle the globe seven times in one year,
p115
aVif prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs,
p116
aVthen perhaps there are other static entities
p117
aVthat we hold inside ourselves,
p118
aVlike grief, like addictions,
p119
aVlike racism,
p120
aVthat can also change.
