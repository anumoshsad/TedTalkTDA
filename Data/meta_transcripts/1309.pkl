VI study how the brain processes
p4
aVinformation. That is, how it takes
p5
aVinformation in from the outside world, and
p6
aVconverts it into patterns of electrical activity,
p7
aVand then how it uses those patterns
p8
aVto allow you to do things \u2014
p9
aVto see, hear, to reach for an object.
p10
aVSo I'm really a basic scientist, not
p11
aVa clinician, but in the last year and a half
p12
aVI've started to switch over, to use what
p13
aVwe've been learning about these patterns
p14
aVof activity to develop prosthetic devices,
p15
aVand what I wanted to do today is show you
p16
aVan example of this.
p17
aVIt's really our first foray into this.
p18
aVIt's the development of a prosthetic device
p19
aVfor treating blindness.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo let me start in on that problem.
p22
aVThere are 10 million people in the U.S.
p23
aVand many more worldwide who are blind
p24
aVor are facing blindness due to diseases
p25
aVof the retina, diseases like
p26
aVmacular degeneration, and there's little
p27
aVthat can be done for them.
p28
aVThere are some drug treatments, but
p29
aVthey're only effective on a small fraction
p30
aVof the population. And so, for the vast
p31
aVmajority of patients, their best hope for
p32
aVregaining sight is through prosthetic devices.
p33
aVThe problem is that current prosthetics
p34
aVdon't work very well. They're still very
p35
aVlimited in the vision that they can provide.
p36
aVAnd so, you know, for example, with these
p37
aVdevices, patients can see simple things
p38
aVlike bright lights and high contrast edges,
p39
aVnot very much more, so nothing close
p40
aVto normal vision has been possible.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo what I'm going to tell you about today
p43
aVis a device that we've been working on
p44
aVthat I think has the potential to make
p45
aVa difference, to be much more effective,
p46
aVand what I wanted to do is show you
p47
aVhow it works. Okay, so let me back up a
p48
aVlittle bit and show you how a normal retina
p49
aVworks first so you can see the problem
p50
aVthat we were trying to solve.
p51
aVHere you have a retina.
p52
aVSo you have an image, a retina, and a brain.
p53
aVSo when you look at something, like this image
p54
aVof this baby's face, it goes into your eye
p55
aVand it lands on your retina, on the front-end
p56
aVcells here, the photoreceptors.
p57
aVThen what happens is the retinal circuitry,
p58
aVthe middle part, goes to work on it,
p59
aVand what it does is it performs operations
p60
aVon it, it extracts information from it, and it
p61
aVconverts that information into a code.
p62
aVAnd the code is in the form of these patterns
p63
aVof electrical pulses that get sent
p64
aVup to the brain, and so the key thing is
p65
aVthat the image ultimately gets converted
p66
aVinto a code. And when I say code,
p67
aVI do literally mean code.
p68
aVLike this pattern of pulses here actually means "baby's face,"
p69
aVand so when the brain gets this pattern
p70
aVof pulses, it knows that what was out there
p71
aVwas a baby's face, and if it
p72
aVgot a different pattern it would know
p73
aVthat what was out there was, say, a dog,
p74
aVor another pattern would be a house.
p75
aVAnyway, you get the idea.
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd, of course, in real life, it's all dynamic,
p78
aVmeaning that it's changing all the time,
p79
aVso the patterns of pulses are changing
p80
aVall the time because the world you're
p81
aVlooking at is changing all the time too.
p82
aVSo, you know, it's sort of a complicated
p83
aVthing. You have these patterns of pulses
p84
aVcoming out of your eye every millisecond
p85
aVtelling your brain what it is that you're seeing.
p86
aVSo what happens when a person
p87
aVgets a retinal degenerative disease like
p88
aVmacular degeneration? What happens is
p89
aVis that, the front-end cells die,
p90
aVthe photoreceptors die, and over time,
p91
aVall the cells and the circuits that are
p92
aVconnected to them, they die too.
p93
aVUntil the only things that you have left
p94
aVare these cells here, the output cells,
p95
aVthe ones that send the signals to the brain,
p96
aVbut because of all that degeneration
p97
aVthey aren't sending any signals anymore.
p98
aVThey aren't getting any input, so
p99
aVthe person's brain no longer gets
p100
aVany visual information \u2014
p101
aVthat is, he or she is blind.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo, a solution to the problem, then,
p104
aVwould be to build a device that could mimic
p105
aVthe actions of that front-end circuitry
p106
aVand send signals to the retina's output cells,
p107
aVand they can go back to doing their
p108
aVnormal job of sending signals to the brain.
p109
aVSo this is what we've been working on,
p110
aVand this is what our prosthetic does.
p111
aVSo it consists of two parts, what we call
p112
aVan encoder and a transducer.
p113
aVAnd so the encoder does just
p114
aVwhat I was saying: it mimics the actions
p115
aVof the front-end circuitry \u2014 so it takes images
p116
aVin and converts them into the retina's code.
p117
aVAnd then the transducer then makes the
p118
aVoutput cells send the code on up
p119
aVto the brain, and the result is
p120
aVa retinal prosthetic that can produce
p121
aVnormal retinal output.
p122
aVSo a completely blind retina,
p123
aVeven one with no front-end circuitry at all,
p124
aVno photoreceptors,
p125
aVcan now send out normal signals,
p126
aVsignals that the brain can understand.
p127
aVSo no other device has been able
p128
aVto do this.
p129
aa(lp130
VOkay, so I just want to take
p131
aVa sentence or two to say something about
p132
aVthe encoder and what it's doing, because
p133
aVit's really the key part and it's
p134
aVsort of interesting and kind of cool.
p135
aVI'm not sure "cool" is really the right word, but
p136
aVyou know what I mean.
p137
aVSo what it's doing is, it's replacing
p138
aVthe retinal circuitry, really the guts of
p139
aVthe retinal circuitry, with a set of equations,
p140
aVa set of equations that we can implement
p141
aVon a chip. So it's just math.
p142
aVIn other words, we're not literally replacing
p143
aVthe components of the retina.
p144
aVIt's not like we're making a little mini-device
p145
aVfor each of the different cell types.
p146
aVWe've just abstracted what the
p147
aVretina's doing with a set of equations.
p148
aVAnd so, in a way, the equations are serving
p149
aVas sort of a codebook. An image comes in,
p150
aVgoes through the set of equations,
p151
aVand out comes streams of electrical pulses,
p152
aVjust like a normal retina would produce.
p153
aa(lp154
VNow let me put my money
p155
aVwhere my mouth is and show you that
p156
aVwe can actually produce normal output,
p157
aVand what the implications of this are.
p158
aVHere are three sets of
p159
aVfiring patterns. The top one is from
p160
aVa normal animal, the middle one is from
p161
aVa blind animal that's been treated with
p162
aVthis encoder-transducer device, and the
p163
aVbottom one is from a blind animal treated
p164
aVwith a standard prosthetic.
p165
aVSo the bottom one is the state-of-the-art
p166
aVdevice that's out there right now, which is
p167
aVbasically made up of light detectors,
p168
aVbut no encoder. So what we did was we
p169
aVpresented movies of everyday things \u2014
p170
aVpeople, babies, park benches,
p171
aVyou know, regular things happening \u2014 and
p172
aVwe recorded the responses from the retinas
p173
aVof these three groups of animals.
p174
aVNow just to orient you, each box is showing
p175
aVthe firing patterns of several cells,
p176
aVand just as in the previous slides,
p177
aVeach row is a different cell,
p178
aVand I just made the pulses a little bit smaller
p179
aVand thinner so I could show you
p180
aVa long stretch of data.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo as you can see, the firing patterns
p183
aVfrom the blind animal treated with
p184
aVthe encoder-transducer really do very
p185
aVclosely match the normal firing patterns \u2014
p186
aVand it's not perfect, but it's pretty good \u2014
p187
aVand the blind animal treated with
p188
aVthe standard prosthetic,
p189
aVthe responses really don't.
p190
aVAnd so with the standard method,
p191
aVthe cells do fire, they just don't fire
p192
aVin the normal firing patterns because
p193
aVthey don't have the right code.
p194
aVHow important is this?
p195
aVWhat's the potential impact
p196
aVon a patient's ability to see?
p197
aVSo I'm just going to show you one
p198
aVbottom-line experiment that answers this,
p199
aVand of course I've got a lot of other data,
p200
aVso if you're interested I'm happy
p201
aVto show more. So the experiment
p202
aVis called a reconstruction experiment.
p203
aVSo what we did is we took a moment
p204
aVin time from these recordings and asked,
p205
aVwhat was the retina seeing at that moment?
p206
aVCan we reconstruct what the retina
p207
aVwas seeing from the responses
p208
aVfrom the firing patterns?
p209
aa(lp210
VSo, when we did this for responses
p211
aVfrom the standard method and from
p212
aVour encoder and transducer.
p213
aVSo let me show you, and I'm going to
p214
aVstart with the standard method first.
p215
aVSo you can see that it's pretty limited,
p216
aVand because the firing patterns aren't
p217
aVin the right code, they're very limited in
p218
aVwhat they can tell you about
p219
aVwhat's out there. So you can see that
p220
aVthere's something there, but it's not so clear
p221
aVwhat that something is, and this just sort of
p222
aVcircles back to what I was saying in the
p223
aVbeginning, that with the standard method,
p224
aVpatients can see high-contrast edges, they
p225
aVcan see light, but it doesn't easily go
p226
aVfurther than that. So what was
p227
aVthe image? It was a baby's face.
p228
aVSo what about with our approach,
p229
aVadding the code? And you can see
p230
aVthat it's much better. Not only can you
p231
aVtell that it's a baby's face, but you can
p232
aVtell that it's this baby's face, which is a
p233
aVreally challenging task.
p234
aVSo on the left is the encoder
p235
aValone, and on the right is from an actual
p236
aVblind retina, so the encoder and the transducer.
p237
aVBut the key one really is the encoder alone,
p238
aVbecause we can team up the encoder with
p239
aVthe different transducer.
p240
aa(lp241
VThis is just actually the first one that we tried.
p242
aVI just wanted to say something about the standard method.
p243
aVWhen this first came out, it was just a really
p244
aVexciting thing, the idea that you
p245
aVeven make a blind retina respond at all.
p246
aVBut there was this limiting factor,
p247
aVthe issue of the code, and how to make
p248
aVthe cells respond better,
p249
aVproduce normal responses,
p250
aVand so this was our contribution.
p251
aVNow I just want to wrap up,
p252
aVand as I was mentioning earlier
p253
aVof course I have a lot of other data
p254
aVif you're interested, but I just wanted to give
p255
aVthis sort of basic idea
p256
aVof being able to communicate
p257
aVwith the brain in its language, and
p258
aVthe potential power of being able to do that.
p259
aVSo it's different from the motor prosthetics
p260
aVwhere you're communicating from the brain
p261
aVto a device. Here we have to communicate
p262
aVfrom the outside world
p263
aVinto the brain and be understood,
p264
aVand be understood by the brain.
p265
aa(lp266
VAnd then the last thing I wanted
p267
aVto say, really, is to emphasize
p268
aVthat the idea generalizes.
p269
aVSo the same strategy that we used
p270
aVto find the code for the retina we can also
p271
aVuse to find the code for other areas,
p272
aVfor example, the auditory system and
p273
aVthe motor system, so for treating deafness
p274
aVand for motor disorders.
p275
aVSo just the same way that we were able to
p276
aVjump over the damaged
p277
aVcircuitry in the retina to get to the retina's
p278
aVoutput cells, we can jump over the
p279
aVdamaged circuitry in the cochlea
p280
aVto get the auditory nerve,
p281
aVor jump over damaged areas in the cortex,
p282
aVin the motor cortex, to bridge the gap
p283
aVproduced by a stroke.
p284
aa(lp285
VI just want to end with a simple
p286
aVmessage that understanding the code
p287
aVis really, really important, and if we
p288
aVcan understand the code,
p289
aVthe language of the brain, things become
p290
aVpossible that didn't seem obviously
p291
aVpossible before. Thank you.
