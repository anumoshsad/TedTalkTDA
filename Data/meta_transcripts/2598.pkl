VOne hot October morning,
p4
aVI got off the all-night train
p5
aVin Mandalay,
p6
aVthe old royal capital of Burma,
p7
aVnow Myanmar.
p8
aVAnd out on the street, I ran into a group of rough men
p9
aVstanding beside their bicycle rickshaws.
p10
aVAnd one of them came up
p11
aVand offered to show me around.
p12
aVThe price he quoted was outrageous.
p13
aVIt was less than I would pay for a bar of chocolate at home.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo I clambered into his trishaw,
p16
aVand he began pedaling us slowly between palaces and pagodas.
p17
aVAnd as he did, he told me how he had come to the city from his village.
p18
aVHe'd earned a degree in mathematics.
p19
aVHis dream was to be a teacher.
p20
aVBut of course, life is hard under a military dictatorship,
p21
aVand so for now, this was the only way he could make a living.
p22
aVMany nights, he told me, he actually slept in his trishaw
p23
aVso he could catch the first visitors off the all-night train.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd very soon, we found that in certain ways,
p26
aVwe had so much in common \u2014
p27
aVwe were both in our 20s,
p28
aVwe were both fascinated by foreign cultures \u2014
p29
aVthat he invited me home.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo we turned off the wide, crowded streets,
p32
aVand we began bumping down rough, wild alleyways.
p33
aVThere were broken shacks all around.
p34
aVI really lost the sense of where I was,
p35
aVand I realized that anything could happen to me now.
p36
aVI could get mugged or drugged
p37
aVor something worse.
p38
aVNobody would know.
p39
aa(lp40
VFinally, he stopped and led me into a hut,
p41
aVwhich consisted of just one tiny room.
p42
aVAnd then he leaned down,
p43
aVand reached under his bed.
p44
aVAnd something in me froze.
p45
aVI waited to see what he would pull out.
p46
aVAnd finally he extracted a box.
p47
aVInside it was every single letter he had ever received
p48
aVfrom visitors from abroad,
p49
aVand on some of them he had pasted
p50
aVlittle black-and-white worn snapshots
p51
aVof his new foreign friends.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo when we said goodbye that night,
p54
aVI realized he had also shown me
p55
aVthe secret point of travel,
p56
aVwhich is to take a plunge,
p57
aVto go inwardly as well as outwardly
p58
aVto places you would never go otherwise,
p59
aVto venture into uncertainty,
p60
aVambiguity,
p61
aVeven fear.
p62
aa(lp63
VAt home, it's dangerously easy
p64
aVto assume we're on top of things.
p65
aVOut in the world, you are reminded every moment that you're not,
p66
aVand you can't get to the bottom of things, either.
p67
aa(lp68
VEverywhere, "People wish to be settled,"
p69
aVRalph Waldo Emerson reminded us,
p70
aV"but only insofar as we are unsettled
p71
aVis there any hope for us."
p72
aa(lp73
VAt this conference, we've been lucky enough
p74
aVto hear some exhilarating new ideas and discoveries
p75
aVand, really, about all the ways
p76
aVin which knowledge is being pushed excitingly forwards.
p77
aVBut at some point, knowledge gives out.
p78
aVAnd that is the moment
p79
aVwhen your life is truly decided:
p80
aVyou fall in love;
p81
aVyou lose a friend;
p82
aVthe lights go out.
p83
aVAnd it's then, when you're lost or uneasy or carried out of yourself,
p84
aVthat you find out who you are.
p85
aa(lp86
VI don't believe that ignorance is bliss.
p87
aVScience has unquestionably made our lives
p88
aVbrighter and longer and healthier.
p89
aVAnd I am forever grateful to the teachers who showed me the laws of physics
p90
aVand pointed out that three times three makes nine.
p91
aVI can count that out on my fingers
p92
aVany time of night or day.
p93
aVBut when a mathematician tells me
p94
aVthat minus three times minus three makes nine,
p95
aVthat's a kind of logic that almost feels like trust.
p96
aa(lp97
VThe opposite of knowledge, in other words, isn't always ignorance.
p98
aVIt can be wonder.
p99
aVOr mystery.
p100
aVPossibility.
p101
aVAnd in my life, I've found it's the things I don't know
p102
aVthat have lifted me up and pushed me forwards
p103
aVmuch more than the things I do know.
p104
aVIt's also the things I don't know
p105
aVthat have often brought me closer to everybody around me.
p106
aa(lp107
VFor eight straight Novembers, recently,
p108
aVI traveled every year across Japan with the Dalai Lama.
p109
aVAnd the one thing he said every day
p110
aVthat most seemed to give people reassurance and confidence
p111
aVwas, "I don't know."
p112
aa(lp113
V"What's going to happen to Tibet?"
p114
aV"When are we ever going to get world peace?"
p115
aV"What's the best way to raise children?"
p116
aa(lp117
V"Frankly," says this very wise man,
p118
aV"I don't know."
p119
aa(lp120
VThe Nobel Prize-winning economist Daniel Kahneman
p121
aVhas spent more than 60 years now researching human behavior,
p122
aVand his conclusion is
p123
aVthat we are always much more confident of what we think we know
p124
aVthan we should be.
p125
aVWe have, as he memorably puts it,
p126
aVan "unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance."
p127
aVWe know \u2014 quote, unquote \u2014 our team is going to win this weekend,
p128
aVand we only remember that knowledge
p129
aVon the rare occasions when we're right.
p130
aVMost of the time, we're in the dark.
p131
aVAnd that's where real intimacy lies.
p132
aa(lp133
VDo you know what your lover is going to do tomorrow?
p134
aVDo you want to know?
p135
aa(lp136
VThe parents of us all, as some people call them,
p137
aVAdam and Eve,
p138
aVcould never die, so long as they were eating from the tree of life.
p139
aVBut the minute they began nibbling
p140
aVfrom the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,
p141
aVthey fell from their innocence.
p142
aVThey grew embarrassed and fretful,
p143
aVself-conscious.
p144
aVAnd they learned, a little too late, perhaps,
p145
aVthat there are certainly some things that we need to know,
p146
aVbut there are many, many more that are better left unexplored.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow, when I was a kid,
p149
aVI knew it all, of course.
p150
aVI had been spending 20 years in classrooms collecting facts,
p151
aVand I was actually in the information business,
p152
aVwriting articles for Time Magazine.
p153
aVAnd I took my first real trip to Japan for two-and-a-half weeks,
p154
aVand I came back with a 40-page essay
p155
aVexplaining every last detail about Japan's temples,
p156
aVits fashions, its baseball games,
p157
aVits soul.
p158
aa(lp159
VBut underneath all that,
p160
aVsomething that I couldn't understand
p161
aVso moved me for reasons I couldn't explain to you yet,
p162
aVthat I decided to go and live in Japan.
p163
aVAnd now that I've been there for 28 years,
p164
aVI really couldn't tell you very much at all
p165
aVabout my adopted home.
p166
aVWhich is wonderful,
p167
aVbecause it means every day I'm making some new discovery,
p168
aVand in the process,
p169
aVlooking around the corner and seeing the hundred thousand things
p170
aVI'll never know.
p171
aa(lp172
VKnowledge is a priceless gift.
p173
aVBut the illusion of knowledge can be more dangerous than ignorance.
p174
aa(lp175
VThinking that you know your lover
p176
aVor your enemy
p177
aVcan be more treacherous
p178
aVthan acknowledging you'll never know them.
p179
aVEvery morning in Japan, as the sun is flooding into our little apartment,
p180
aVI take great pains not to consult the weather forecast,
p181
aVbecause if I do,
p182
aVmy mind will be overclouded, distracted,
p183
aVeven when the day is bright.
p184
aa(lp185
VI've been a full-time writer now for 34 years.
p186
aVAnd the one thing that I have learned
p187
aVis that transformation comes when I'm not in charge,
p188
aVwhen I don't know what's coming next,
p189
aVwhen I can't assume I am bigger than everything around me.
p190
aVAnd the same is true in love
p191
aVor in moments of crisis.
p192
aVSuddenly, we're back in that trishaw again
p193
aVand we're bumping off the broad, well-lit streets;
p194
aVand we're reminded, really, of the first law of travel
p195
aVand, therefore, of life:
p196
aVyou're only as strong as your readiness to surrender.
p197
aa(lp198
VIn the end, perhaps,
p199
aVbeing human
p200
aVis much more important
p201
aVthan being fully in the know.
p202
aa(lp203
VThank you.
