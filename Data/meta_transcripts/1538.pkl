VThe will to live life differently can start
p4
aVin some of the most unusual places.
p5
aVThis is where I come from, Todmorden.
p6
aVIt's a market town in the north of England,
p7
aV15,000 people, between Leeds and Manchester,
p8
aVfairly normal market town.
p9
aVIt used to look like this,
p10
aVand now it's more like this,
p11
aVwith fruit and veg and herbs sprouting up all over the place.
p12
aVWe call it propaganda gardening. (Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VCorner row railway, station car park,
p15
aVfront of a health center, people's front gardens,
p16
aVand even in front of the police station. (Laughter)
p17
aVWe've got edible canal towpaths,
p18
aVand we've got sprouting cemeteries.
p19
aVThe soil is extremely good. (Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VWe've even invented a new form of tourism.
p22
aVIt's called vegetable tourism, and believe it or not,
p23
aVpeople come from all over the world to poke around in our raised beds,
p24
aVeven when there's not much growing. (Laughter)
p25
aVBut it starts a conversation. (Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd, you know, we're not doing it because we're bored. (Laughter)
p28
aVWe're doing it because we want to start a revolution.
p29
aa(lp30
VWe tried to answer this simple question:
p31
aVCan you find a unifying language that cuts across age
p32
aVand income and culture that will help people themselves
p33
aVfind a new way of living,
p34
aVsee spaces around them differently,
p35
aVthink about the resources they use differently,
p36
aVinteract differently?
p37
aVCan we find that language?
p38
aVAnd then, can we replicate those actions?
p39
aVAnd the answer would appear to be yes,
p40
aVand the language would appear to be food.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo, three and a half years ago, a few of us
p43
aVsat around a kitchen table and
p44
aVwe just invented the whole thing. (Laughter)
p45
aV(Applause)
p46
aVWe came up with a really simple game plan that we put to a public meeting.
p47
aVWe did not consult. We did not write a report.
p48
aVEnough of all that. (Laughter)
p49
aVAnd we said to that public meeting in Todmorden,
p50
aVlook, let's imagine that our town
p51
aVis focused around three plates:
p52
aVa community plate, the way we live our everyday lives;
p53
aVa learning plate, what we teach our kids in school
p54
aVand what new skills we share amongst ourselves;
p55
aVand business, what we do with the pound in our pocket
p56
aVand which businesses we choose to support.
p57
aa(lp58
VNow, let's imagine those plates agitated
p59
aVwith community actions around food.
p60
aVIf we start one of those community plates spinning,
p61
aVthat's really great, that really starts to empower people,
p62
aVbut if we can then spin that community plate
p63
aVwith the learning plate, and then spin it with the business plate,
p64
aVwe've got a real show there, we've got some action theater.
p65
aVWe're starting to build resilience ourselves.
p66
aVWe're starting to reinvent community ourselves,
p67
aVand we've done it all without a flipping strategy document.
p68
aV(Applause)
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd here's the thing as well.
p71
aVWe've not asked anybody's permission to do this,
p72
aVwe're just doing it. (Laughter)
p73
aVAnd we are certainly not waiting for that check
p74
aVto drop through the letterbox before we start,
p75
aVand most importantly of all, we are not daunted
p76
aVby the sophisticated arguments that say,
p77
aV"These small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow's problems,"
p78
aVbecause I have seen the power of small actions,
p79
aVand it is awesome.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo, back to the public meeting. (Laughter)
p82
aVWe put that proposition to the meeting, two seconds,
p83
aVand then the room exploded.
p84
aVI have never, ever experienced anything like that in my life.
p85
aVAnd it's been the same in every single room, in every town
p86
aVthat we've ever told our story.
p87
aVPeople are ready and respond to the story of food.
p88
aVThey want positive actions they can engage in,
p89
aVand in their bones, they know it's time
p90
aVto take personal responsibility
p91
aVand invest in more kindness to each other
p92
aVand to the environment.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd since we had that meeting three and a half years ago,
p95
aVit's been a heck of a roller coaster.
p96
aVWe started with a seed swap, really simple stuff,
p97
aVand then we took an area of land, a strip on the side
p98
aVof our main road, which was a dog toilet, basically,
p99
aVand we turned it into a really lovely herb garden.
p100
aVWe took the corner of the car park in the station
p101
aVthat you saw, and we made vegetable beds
p102
aVfor everybody to share and pick from themselves.
p103
aVWe went to the doctors. We've just had
p104
aVa 6-million-pound health center built in Todmorden,
p105
aVand for some reason that I cannot comprehend,
p106
aVit has been surrounded by prickly plants. (Laughter)
p107
aVSo we went to the doctors, said, "Would you mind us taking them up?"
p108
aVThey said, "Absolutely fine, provided you get planning permission
p109
aVand you do it in Latin and you do it in triplicate,"
p110
aVso we did \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 and now there are fruit trees
p111
aVand bushes and herbs and vegetables
p112
aVaround that doctor's surgery.
p113
aVAnd there's been lots of other examples, like the corn
p114
aVthat was in front of the police station,
p115
aVand the old people's home that we've planted it with food
p116
aVthat they can pick and grow.
p117
aa(lp118
VBut it isn't just about growing,
p119
aVbecause we all are part of this jigsaw.
p120
aVIt's about taking those artistic people in your community
p121
aVand doing some fabulous designs in those raised beds
p122
aVto explain to people what's growing there,
p123
aVbecause there's so many people that don't really recognize
p124
aVa vegetable unless it's in a bit of plastic
p125
aVwith a bit of an instruction packet on the top. (Laughter)
p126
aVSo we have some people who designed these things,
p127
aV"If it looks like this, please don't pick it, but if it looks like this,
p128
aVhelp yourself."
p129
aVThis is about sharing and investing in kindness.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd for those people that don't want to do either
p132
aVof those things, maybe they can cook,
p133
aVso we pick them seasonally and then we go on the street,
p134
aVor in the pub, or in the church,
p135
aVor wherever people are living their lives.
p136
aVThis is about us going to the people and saying,
p137
aV"We are all part of the local food jigsaw,
p138
aVwe are all part of a solution."
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd then, because we know we've got vegetable tourists
p141
aVand we love them to bits and they're absolutely fantastic,
p142
aVwe thought, what could we do to give them an even better experience?
p143
aVSo we invented, without asking, of course,
p144
aVthe Incredible Edible Green Route.
p145
aVAnd this is a route of exhibition gardens,
p146
aVand edible towpaths, and bee-friendly sites, and the story
p147
aVof pollinators, and it's a route that we designed
p148
aVthat takes people through the whole of our town,
p149
aVpast our cafes and our small shops, through our market,
p150
aVnot just to and fro from the supermarket,
p151
aVand we're hoping that, in changing people's footfall
p152
aVaround our town, we're also changing their behavior.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd then there's the second plate, the learning plate.
p155
aVWell, we're in partnership with a high school.
p156
aVWe've created a company. We are designing and building
p157
aVan aquaponics unit in some land that was spare
p158
aVat the back of the high school, like you do,
p159
aVand now we're going to be growing fish and vegetables
p160
aVin an orchard with bees,
p161
aVand the kids are helping us build that,
p162
aVand the kids are on the board, and because the community
p163
aVwas really keen on working with the high school,
p164
aVthe high school is now teaching agriculture,
p165
aVand because it's teaching agriculture, we started to think,
p166
aVhow could we then get those kids that never had a qualification
p167
aVbefore in their lives but are really excited about growing,
p168
aVhow can we give them some more experience?
p169
aa(lp170
VSo we got some land that was donated
p171
aVby a local garden center.
p172
aVIt was really quite muddy, but in a truly incredible way,
p173
aVtotally voluntary-led, we have turned that
p174
aVinto a market garden training center,
p175
aVand that is polytunnels and raised beds
p176
aVand all the things you need to get the soil under your fingers
p177
aVand think maybe there's a job in this for me in the future.
p178
aVAnd because we were doing that, some local academics said,
p179
aV"You know, we could help design
p180
aVa commercial horticulture course for you.
p181
aVThere's not one that we know of."
p182
aVSo they're doing that, and we're going to launch it later this year,
p183
aVand it's all an experiment, and it's all voluntary.
p184
aa(lp185
VAnd then there's the third plate,
p186
aVbecause if you walk through an edible landscape,
p187
aVand if you're learning new skills, and if you start to get
p188
aVinterested in what's growing seasonally,
p189
aVyou might just want to spend more of your own money
p190
aVin support of local producers,
p191
aVnot just veg, but meat and cheese and beer
p192
aVand whatever else it might be.
p193
aa(lp194
VBut then, we're just a community group, you know.
p195
aVWe're just all volunteers. What could we actually do?
p196
aVSo we did some really simple things.
p197
aVWe fundraised, we got some blackboards,
p198
aVwe put "Incredible Edible" on the top,
p199
aVwe gave it every market trader that was selling locally,
p200
aVand they scribbled on what they were selling in any one week.
p201
aVReally popular. People congregated around it.
p202
aVSales were up.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd then, we had a chat with the farmers, and we said,
p205
aV"We're really serious about this,"
p206
aVbut they didn't actually believe us, so we thought,
p207
aVokay, what should we do? I know. If we can create
p208
aVa campaign around one product and show them
p209
aVthere is local loyalty to that product,
p210
aVmaybe they'll change their mind and see we're serious.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo we launched a campaign \u2014 because it just amuses me \u2014
p213
aVcalled Every Egg Matters. (Laughter)
p214
aVAnd what we did was we put people on our egg map.
p215
aVIt's a stylized map of Togmorden.
p216
aVAnybody that's selling their excess eggs
p217
aVat the garden gate, perfectly legally, to their neighbors,
p218
aVwe've stuck on there. We started with four,
p219
aVand we've now got 64 on, and the result of that was
p220
aVthat people were then going into shops
p221
aVasking for a local Todmorden egg, and the result of that
p222
aVwas, some farmers upped the amount of flocks they got
p223
aVof free range birds, and then they went on to meat birds,
p224
aVand although these are really, really small steps,
p225
aVthat increasing local economic confidence
p226
aVis starting to play out in a number of ways,
p227
aVand we now have farmers doing cheese
p228
aVand they've upped their flocks and rare breed pigs,
p229
aVthey're doing pasties and pies and things
p230
aVthat they would have never done before.
p231
aVWe've got increasing market stalls selling local food,
p232
aVand in a survey that local students did for us, 49 percent
p233
aVof all food traders in that town said that their bottom line
p234
aVhad increased because of what we were actually doing.
p235
aVAnd we're just volunteers and it's only an experiment.
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VNow, none of this is rocket science.
p239
aVIt certainly is not clever, and it's not original.
p240
aVBut it is joined up, and it is inclusive.
p241
aVThis is not a movement for those people
p242
aVthat are going to sort themselves out anyway.
p243
aVThis is a movement for everyone.
p244
aVWe have a motto: If you eat, you're in. (Laughter)
p245
aV(Applause)
p246
aVAcross age, across income, across culture.
p247
aa(lp248
VIt's been really quite a roller coaster experience,
p249
aVbut going back to that first question that we asked,
p250
aVis it replicable? Yeah. It most certainly is replicable.
p251
aa(lp252
VMore than 30 towns in England now are spinning
p253
aVthe Incredible Edible plate.
p254
aVWhichever way they want to do it, of their own volition,
p255
aVthey're trying to make their own lives differently,
p256
aVand worldwide, we've got communities across America
p257
aVand Japan \u2014 it's incredible, isn't it? I mean,
p258
aVAmerica and Japan and New Zealand.
p259
aVPeople after the earthquake in New Zealand visited us
p260
aVin order to incorporate some of this public spiritedness
p261
aVaround local growing into the heart of Christchurch.
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd none of this takes more money
p264
aVand none of this demands a bureaucracy,
p265
aVbut it does demand that you think things differently
p266
aVand you are prepared to bend budgets and work programs
p267
aVin order to create that supportive framework
p268
aVthat communities can bounce off.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd there's some great ideas already in our patch.
p271
aVOur local authority has decided to make everywhere
p272
aVIncredible Edible, and in support of that
p273
aVhave decided to do two things.
p274
aa(lp275
VFirst, they're going to create an asset register of spare land
p276
aVthat they've got, put it in a food bank so that communities
p277
aVcan use that wherever they live,
p278
aVand they're going to underpin that with a license.
p279
aa(lp280
VAnd then they've said to every single one of their workforce,
p281
aVif you can, help those communities grow,
p282
aVand help them to maintain their spaces.
p283
aa(lp284
VSuddenly, we're seeing actions on the ground
p285
aVfrom local government. We're seeing this mainstreamed.
p286
aVWe are responding creatively at last to what Rio demanded
p287
aVof us, and there's lots more you could do.
p288
aVI mean, just to list a few. One, please stop putting
p289
aVprickly plants around public buildings. It's a waste of space.
p290
aV(Laughter) Secondly, please create \u2014 please, please create
p291
aVedible landscapes so that our children start to walk
p292
aVpast their food day in, day out, on our high streets,
p293
aVin our parks, wherever that might be.
p294
aVInspire local planners to put the food sites at the heart
p295
aVof the town and the city plan, not relegate them
p296
aVto the edges of the settlements that nobody can see.
p297
aVEncourage all our schools to take this seriously.
p298
aVThis isn't a second class exercise.
p299
aVIf we want to inspire the farmers of tomorrow,
p300
aVthen please let us say to every school,
p301
aVcreate a sense of purpose around the importance
p302
aVto the environment, local food and soils.
p303
aVPut that at the heart of your school culture,
p304
aVand you will create a different generation.
p305
aa(lp306
VThere are so many things you can do, but ultimately
p307
aVthis is about something really simple.
p308
aVThrough an organic process, through
p309
aVan increasing recognition of the power of small actions,
p310
aVwe are starting, at last, to believe in ourselves again,
p311
aVand to believe in our capacity, each and every one of us,
p312
aVto build a different and a kinder future,
p313
aVand in my book, that's incredible.
p314
aVThank you. (Applause)

p316
aVThank you very much. (Applause)
