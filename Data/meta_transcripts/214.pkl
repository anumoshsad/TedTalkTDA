VIt's a simple idea about nature.
p4
aVI want to say a word for nature
p5
aVbecause we haven't talked that much about it the last couple days.
p6
aVI want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals,
p7
aVand tell you about a tool, a very simple tool that I have found.
p8
aVAlthough it's really nothing more than a literary conceit; it's not a technology.
p9
aVIt's very powerful for, I think, changing our relationship to the natural world
p10
aVand to the other species on whom we depend.
p11
aVAnd that tool is very simply, as Chris suggested,
p12
aVlooking at us and the world from the plants' or the animals' point of view.
p13
aVIt's not my idea, other people have hit on it,
p14
aVbut I've tried to take it to some new places.
p15
aa(lp16
VLet me tell you where I got it.
p17
aVLike a lot of my ideas, like a lot of the tools I use,
p18
aVI found it in the garden; I'm a very devoted gardener.
p19
aVAnd there was a day about seven years ago: I was planting potatoes,
p20
aVit was the first week of May \u2014
p21
aVthis is New England, when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom;
p22
aVthey're just white clouds above.
p23
aVI was here, planting my chunks,
p24
aVcutting up potatoes and planting it,
p25
aVand the bees were working on this tree;
p26
aVbumblebees, just making this thing vibrate.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd one of the things I really like about gardening
p29
aVis that it doesn't take all your concentration,
p30
aVyou really can't get hurt \u2014 it's not like woodworking \u2014
p31
aVand you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation.
p32
aVAnd the question I asked myself that afternoon in the garden,
p33
aVworking alongside that bumblebee,
p34
aVwas: what did I and that bumblebee have in common?
p35
aVHow was our role in this garden similar and different?
p36
aVAnd I realized we actually had quite a bit in common:
p37
aVboth of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another,
p38
aVand both of us \u2014 probably, if I can imagine the bee's point of view \u2014
p39
aVthought we were calling the shots.
p40
aVI had decided what kind of potato I wanted to plant \u2014
p41
aVI had picked my Yukon Gold or Yellow Finn, or whatever it was \u2014
p42
aVand I had summoned those genes from a seed catalog across the country,
p43
aVbrought it, and I was planting it.
p44
aVAnd that bee, no doubt, assumed that it had decided,
p45
aV"I'm going for that apple tree, I'm going for that blossom,
p46
aVI'm going to get the nectar and I'm going to leave."
p47
aa(lp48
VWe have a grammar that suggests that's who we are;
p49
aVthat we are sovereign subjects in nature, the bee as well as me.
p50
aVI plant the potatoes, I weed the garden, I domesticate the species.
p51
aVBut that day, it occurred to me:
p52
aVwhat if that grammar is nothing more than a self-serving conceit?
p53
aVBecause, of course, the bee thinks he's in charge or she's in charge,
p54
aVbut we know better.
p55
aVWe know that what's going on between the bee and that flower
p56
aVis that bee has been cleverly manipulated by that flower.
p57
aVAnd when I say manipulated, I'm talking about in a Darwinian sense, right?
p58
aVI mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits \u2014
p59
aVcolor, scent, flavor, pattern \u2014 that has lured that bee in.
p60
aVAnd the bee has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar,
p61
aVand also picking up some powder on its leg,
p62
aVand going off to the next blossom.
p63
aVThe bee is not calling the shots.
p64
aVAnd I realized then, I wasn't either.
p65
aa(lp66
VI had been seduced by that potato and not another
p67
aVinto planting its \u2014 into spreading its genes, giving it a little bit more habitat.
p68
aVAnd that's when I got the idea, which was, "Well, what would happen
p69
aVif we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us?"
p70
aVAnd agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention, not as a human technology,
p71
aVbut as a co-evolutionary development
p72
aVin which a group of very clever species, mostly edible grasses, had exploited us,
p73
aVfigured out how to get us to basically deforest the world.
p74
aVThe competition of grasses, right?
p75
aVAnd suddenly everything looked different.
p76
aVAnd suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience.
p77
aa(lp78
VI had thought always \u2014 and in fact, had written this in my first book;
p79
aVthis was a book about gardening \u2014
p80
aVthat lawns were nature under culture's boot,
p81
aVthat they were totalitarian landscapes,
p82
aVand that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing the species
p83
aVand never letting it set seed or die or have sex.
p84
aVAnd that's what the lawn was.
p85
aVBut then I realized, "No, this is exactly what the grasses want us to do.
p86
aVI'm a dupe. I'm a dupe of the lawns, whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees,
p87
aVwho they compete with for sunlight."
p88
aVAnd so by getting us to mow the lawn, we keep the trees from coming back,
p89
aVwhich in New England happens very, very quickly.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo I started looking at things this way
p92
aVand wrote a whole book about it called "The Botany of Desire."
p93
aVAnd I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower
p94
aVand deduce all sorts of interesting things about the taste and the desires of bees \u2014
p95
aVthat they like sweetness, that they like this color and not that color, that they like symmetry \u2014
p96
aVwhat could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing?
p97
aVThat a certain kind of potato, a certain kind of drug,
p98
aVa sativa-indica Cannabis cross has something to say about us.
p99
aVAnd that, wouldn't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world?
p100
aa(lp101
VNow, the test of any idea \u2014 I said it was a literary conceit \u2014
p102
aVis what does it get us?
p103
aVAnd when you're talking about nature, which is really my subject as a writer,
p104
aVhow does it meet the Aldo Leopold test?
p105
aVWhich is, does it make us better citizens of the biotic community?
p106
aVGet us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota,
p107
aVrather than its destruction?
p108
aVAnd I would submit that this idea does this.
p109
aVSo, let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way,
p110
aVbesides some entertaining insights about human desire.
p111
aa(lp112
VAs an intellectual matter, looking at the world from other species' points of view
p113
aVhelps us deal with this weird anomaly,
p114
aVwhich is \u2014 and this is in the realm of intellectual history \u2014
p115
aVwhich is that we have this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago ...
p116
aVUgh. Mini-Me. (Laughter)
p117
aVWe have this intellectual, this Darwinian revolution in which, thanks to Darwin,
p118
aVwe figured out we are just one species among many;
p119
aVevolution is working on us the same way it's working on all the others;
p120
aVwe are acted upon as well as acting;
p121
aVwe are really in the fiber, the fabric of life.
p122
aVBut the weird thing is, we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later;
p123
aVnone of us really believes this.
p124
aVWe are still Cartesians \u2014 the children of Descartes \u2014
p125
aVwho believe that subjectivity, consciousness, sets us apart;
p126
aVthat the world is divided into subjects and objects;
p127
aVthat there is nature on one side, culture on another.
p128
aVAs soon as you start seeing things from the plant's point of view or the animal's point of view,
p129
aVyou realize that the real literary conceit is that \u2014
p130
aVis the idea that nature is opposed to culture,
p131
aVthe idea that consciousness is everything \u2014
p132
aVand that's another very important thing it does.
p133
aa(lp134
VLooking at the world from other species' points of view
p135
aVis a cure for the disease of human self-importance.
p136
aVYou suddenly realize that consciousness \u2014
p137
aVwhich we value and we consider
p138
aVthe crowning achievement of nature,
p139
aVhuman consciousness \u2014 is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world.
p140
aVAnd it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool.
p141
aVBut, you know, there's a comedian who said,
p142
aV"Well, who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important?
p143
aVWell, consciousness."
p144
aVSo when you look at the plants, you realize that there are other tools
p145
aVand they're just as interesting.
p146
aa(lp147
VI'll give you two examples, also from the garden:
p148
aVlima beans. You know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites?
p149
aVIt releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world
p150
aVand summons another species of mite
p151
aVthat comes in and attacks the spider mite, defending the lima bean.
p152
aVSo what plants have \u2014 while we have consciousness, tool making, language,
p153
aVthey have biochemistry.
p154
aVAnd they have perfected that to a degree far beyond what we can imagine.
p155
aVTheir complexity, their sophistication, is something to really marvel at,
p156
aVand I think it's really the scandal of the Human Genome Project.
p157
aVYou know, we went into it thinking, 40,000 or 50,000 human genes
p158
aVand we came out with only 23,000.
p159
aVJust to give you grounds for comparison, rice: 35,000 genes.
p160
aVSo who's the more sophisticated species?
p161
aVWell, we're all equally sophisticated.
p162
aVWe've been evolving just as long,
p163
aVjust along different paths.
p164
aVSo, cure for self-importance, way to sort of make us feel the Darwinian idea.
p165
aVAnd that's really what I do as a writer, as a storyteller,
p166
aVis try to make people feel what we know and tell stories that actually
p167
aVhelp us think ecologically.
p168
aa(lp169
VNow, the other use of this is practical.
p170
aVAnd I'm going to take you to a farm right now,
p171
aVbecause I used this idea to develop my understanding of the food system
p172
aVand what I learned, in fact, is that we are all, now, being manipulated by corn.
p173
aVAnd the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today,
p174
aVto me, is the final triumph of corn over good sense. (Laughter) (Applause)
p175
aVIt is part of corn's scheme for world domination.
p176
aV(Laughter)
p177
aVAnd you will see, the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year
p178
aVand there will be that much more habitat
p179
aVbecause we've decided ethanol is going to help us.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo it helped me understand industrial agriculture,
p182
aVwhich of course is a Cartesian system.
p183
aVIt's based on this idea that we bend other species to our will
p184
aVand that we are in charge, and that we create these factories
p185
aVand we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it
p186
aVor the fuel or whatever we want.
p187
aVLet me take you to a very different kind of farm.
p188
aa(lp189
VThis is a farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia.
p190
aVI went looking for a farm where these ideas
p191
aVabout looking at things from the species' point of view are actually implemented,
p192
aVand I found it in a man. The farmer's name is Joel Salatin.
p193
aVAnd I spent a week as an apprentice on his farm,
p194
aVand I took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature
p195
aVthat I've ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature.
p196
aVAnd that is this:
p197
aVthe farm is called Polyface, which means ...
p198
aVthe idea is he's got six different species of animals, as well as some plants,
p199
aVgrowing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement.
p200
aa(lp201
VIt's permaculture, those of you who know a little bit about this,
p202
aVsuch that the cows and the pigs and the sheep and the turkeys and the ...
p203
aVwhat else does he have?
p204
aVAll the six different species \u2014 rabbits, actually \u2014
p205
aVare all performing ecological services for one another,
p206
aVsuch that the manure of one is the lunch for the other
p207
aVand they take care of pests for one another.
p208
aVIt's a very elaborate and beautiful dance,
p209
aVbut I'm going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it,
p210
aVand that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens, his laying hens.
p211
aVAnd I'll show you, if you take this approach, what you get, OK?
p212
aVAnd this is a lot more than growing food, as you'll see;
p213
aVthis is a different way to think about nature
p214
aVand a way to get away from the zero-sum notion,
p215
aVthe Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning,
p216
aVand that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo, one day, cattle in a pen.
p219
aVThe only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing:
p220
aVrelatively new, hooked to a car battery;
p221
aVeven I could carry a quarter-acre paddock, set it up in 15 minutes.
p222
aVCows graze one day. They move, OK?
p223
aVThey graze everything down, intensive grazing.
p224
aVHe waits three days,
p225
aVand then we towed in something called the Eggmobile.
p226
aVThe Eggmobile is a very rickety contraption \u2014
p227
aVit looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards \u2014
p228
aVbut it houses 350 chickens.
p229
aVHe tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank,
p230
aVturns them down, and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank \u2014
p231
aVclucking, gossiping as chickens will \u2014
p232
aVand they make a beeline for the cow patties.
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd what they're doing is very interesting:
p235
aVthey're digging through the cow patties
p236
aVfor the maggots, the grubs, the larvae of flies.
p237
aVAnd the reason he's waited three days
p238
aVis because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day, those larvae will hatch
p239
aVand he'll have a huge fly problem.
p240
aVBut he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can
p241
aVbecause they are the chickens' favorite form of protein.
p242
aa(lp243
VSo the chickens do their kind of little breakdance
p244
aVand they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs,
p245
aVand in the process they're spreading the manure out.
p246
aVVery useful second ecosystem service.
p247
aVAnd third, while they're in this paddock
p248
aVthey are, of course, defecating madly
p249
aVand their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field.
p250
aVThey then move out to the next one,
p251
aVand in the course of just a few weeks, the grass just enters this blaze of growth.
p252
aVAnd within four or five weeks, he can do it again.
p253
aVHe can graze again, he can cut, he can bring in another species,
p254
aVlike the lambs, or he can make hay for the winter.
p255
aa(lp256
VNow, I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there.
p257
aVSo, it's a very productive system.
p258
aVAnd what I need to tell you is that on 100 acres
p259
aVhe gets 40,000 pounds of beef; 30,000 pounds of pork; 25,000 dozen eggs;
p260
aV20,000 broilers; 1,000 turkeys; 1,000 rabbits \u2014
p261
aVan immense amount of food.
p262
aa(lp263
VYou know, you hear, "Can organic feed the world?"
p264
aVWell, look how much food you can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of ...
p265
aVagain, give each species what it wants,
p266
aVlet it realize its desires, its physiological distinctiveness.
p267
aVPut that in play.
p268
aa(lp269
VBut look at it from the point of view of the grass, now.
p270
aVWhat happens to the grass when you do this?
p271
aVWhen a ruminant grazes grass, the grass is cut from this height to this height,
p272
aVand it immediately does something very interesting.
p273
aVAny one of you who gardens knows that there is something called the root-shoot ratio,
p274
aVand plants need to keep the root mass
p275
aVin some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy.
p276
aVSo when they lose a lot of leaf mass, they shed roots;
p277
aVthey kind of cauterize them and the roots die.
p278
aVAnd the species in the soil go to work
p279
aVbasically chewing through those roots, decomposing them \u2014
p280
aVthe earthworms, the fungi, the bacteria \u2014 and the result is new soil.
p281
aVThis is how soil is created.
p282
aVIt's created from the bottom up.
p283
aVThis is how the prairies were built,
p284
aVthe relationship between bison and grasses.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd what I realized when I understood this \u2014
p287
aVand if you ask Joel Salatin what he is, he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer,
p288
aVhe's not a sheep farmer, he's not a cattle rancher; he's a grass farmer,
p289
aVbecause grass is really the keystone species of such a system \u2014
p290
aVis that, if you think about it, this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads,
p291
aVwhich is that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished.
p292
aVMore for us, less for nature.
p293
aVHere, all this food comes off this farm, and at the end of the season
p294
aVthere is actually more soil, more fertility and more biodiversity.
p295
aa(lp296
VIt's a remarkably hopeful thing to do.
p297
aVThere are a lot of farmers doing this today.
p298
aVThis is well beyond organic agriculture,
p299
aVwhich is still a Cartesian system, more or less.
p300
aVAnd what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species,
p301
aVtake account of the soil, that even with nothing more than this perspectival idea
p302
aV\u2014 because there is no technology involved here except for those fences,
p303
aVwhich are so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time \u2014
p304
aVthat we can take the food we need from the Earth
p305
aVand actually heal the Earth in the process.
p306
aa(lp307
VThis is a way to reanimate the world,
p308
aVand that's what's so exciting about this perspective.
p309
aVWhen we really begin to feel Darwin's insights in our bones,
p310
aVthe things we can do with nothing more than these ideas
p311
aVare something to be very hopeful about.
p312
