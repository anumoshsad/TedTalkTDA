VI'd like to introduce you to my mom.
p4
aa(lp5
V(Laughter)
p6
aa(lp7
VI'm guessing that's not what you expected,
p8
aVand it's not what I expected either,
p9
aVand thank goodness I realized that an Asian man was not my mom
p10
aVbefore I hugged him,
p11
aVbecause that would have been so awkward.
p12
aa(lp13
VRecognizing people isn't one of my strengths
p14
aVdue to a genetic visual impairment that has no correction or cure.
p15
aVAs a result, I am legally blind,
p16
aVthough I prefer "partially sighted" because it's more optimistic.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd I'm entitled to the label "disabled."
p21
aa(lp22
VI hate the word disabled when it's used to describe people.
p23
aVIt detonates a mindset of less than
p24
aVthat utterly disregards capacity,
p25
aVability, potential,
p26
aVinstead prioritizing brokenness
p27
aVand lack.
p28
aa(lp29
VThe perspective can be overt.
p30
aVWhat can't he do for himself that I'm going to have to do for him?
p31
aVShe'll probably need some accommodation
p32
aVthat no other employee at this business needs.
p33
aVSometimes, the hidden bias
p34
aVis so sweetly conveyed.
p35
aV"Wow, Susan,
p36
aVlook at everything you've done in your career and your life.
p37
aVHow did you do all of that and be visually impaired?"
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VI fail at being disabled.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VSo in the spirit of incentivizing the rampant failure
p46
aVof people all over the world
p47
aVand enticing the so-called normal to just give it a rest already,
p48
aVhere are five tips
p49
aVto fail at being disabled.
p50
aa(lp51
VTip one:
p52
aVknow your superpowers.
p53
aVThe best team I ever led in my career
p54
aVwas based on superpowers,
p55
aVand we even gave ourselves fancy-pantsy titles
p56
aVlike "the Pillar of Masterly Acumen."
p57
aV"The Biscuit Butterer."
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
V"The Voice of Reason."
p62
aa(lp63
VBecause we relied on our strengths,
p64
aVour best strengths,
p65
aVwe achieved tremendous outcomes.
p66
aVThe trait that prevents me from recognizing my mom
p67
aVallows me to smoothly adapt,
p68
aVto quickly absorb and accurately process an exhausting volume of cues,
p69
aVtease out what's important,
p70
aVdetermine multiple processes or potentials for any situation that I'm in,
p71
aVand then select the one that makes the most sense,
p72
aVall in a matter of seconds.
p73
aVI see what other people do not.
p74
aVSome people think that's a superpower,
p75
aVbut my real superpowers
p76
aVare ricocheting off of glass walls \u2014
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
Vand letting my friends walk around with kale in their teeth.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VIt's true. Don't have lunch with me,
p85
aVor dinner.
p86
aa(lp87
VTip two: be supremely skilled,
p88
aVsupremely skilled at getting it wrong.
p89
aVIt is important to be as equally confident in your superpowers
p90
aVas you are in you FUBARs.
p91
aVThat's "effed up beyond all recognition"
p92
aVfor you millennials.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VHere's a good example.
p97
aVIt is not a great idea to say,
p98
aV"Don't worry, everything in here is too small for me to see"
p99
aVwhen you accidentally walk into the men's room \u2014
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
Vat one of the world's largest sporting arenas \u2014
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
Vor anywhere.
p108
aVI really wish that one wasn't true.
p109
aVI'm serious. It is better to just walk out and let them think you're drunk.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VTip three: know that everyone is disabled in some way,
p114
aVlike when you have a cold and you can't smell
p115
aVand you realize that the milk that you splashed in your coffee was sour
p116
aVonly after you've tasted it.
p117
aVVery recently, a woman walked up to me frantic.
p118
aVShe could not find the bakery she was looking for.
p119
aVAs I motioned in the direction I thought she should go,
p120
aVsaying, "There are no stores on this side of the street
p121
aVso your best bet is to cross \u2014"
p122
aa(lp123
V"Oh my goodness," she interrupted.
p124
aV"There it is.
p125
aVAll I needed was another set of eyes."
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VI just let her have it.
p130
aVI would have said that, you know,
p131
aVbeing logical and paying attention
p132
aVand staying calm would have done the trick,
p133
aVbut who am I?
p134
aa(lp135
VTip four: point out the disability in others.
p136
aVThis one is best reserved \u2014 very important note \u2014
p137
aVthis one is best reserved for people you know well,
p138
aVbecause random strangers typically don't appreciate
p139
aVteachable moments.
p140
aVA few years ago, my parents and I went to see the Rockettes,
p141
aVRadio City's high-kicking dancers.
p142
aVI leaned over to my dad.
p143
aa(lp144
V"The two Rockettes on the left aren't kicking in a straight line."
p145
aa(lp146
V"Yes, they are."
p147
aa(lp148
V"No, they're not."
p149
aa(lp150
V"Yes, they are, and how do you know?
p151
aVYou can't see."
p152
aa(lp153
VBut I know what a straight line looks like.
p154
aVI had snapped a picture during our back and forth
p155
aVand presented him the evidence that proved I was right.
p156
aVHe looked at the picture.
p157
aVI leaned in further.
p158
aa(lp159
V"Who's disabled now?"
p160
aa(lp161
VTip five: pursue audacious goals.
p162
aVFlip expectation upside down
p163
aVand shove limitation off a cliff to meet its demise.
p164
aVThere is a college football linebacker
p165
aVwho blitzes, tackles, recovers fumbles
p166
aVwhile having one hand.
p167
aVThere is a teacher who successfully transfers knowledge
p168
aVand inspires countless students
p169
aVwhile living with Down syndrome.
p170
aVAnd for me,
p171
aVon my long list,
p172
aVto cycle from Kathmandu, Nepal, to Darjeeling, India
p173
aVon the backseat of a bicycle built for two.
p174
aVIt will be an exciting 620-mile adventure,
p175
aVand I'm sure I will have the blurry photos to show for it.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VOh, before we go on, I forgot to introduce you to my mom.
p180
aVI need to do that.
p181
aVAnd here she is,
p182
aVas she would appear to me
p183
aVif I were looking through a crowd of people looking for her.
p184
aVOr is that an Asian man?
p185
aa(lp186
VThank you.
