(lp3
VWell, I learned a lot of things about ballooning,
p4
aVespecially at the end of these balloon flights
p5
aVaround the world I did with Brian Jones.
p6
aVWhen I took this picture,
p7
aVthe window was frozen because of the moisture of the night.
p8
aVAnd on the other side there was a rising sun.
p9
aVSo, you see that on the other side of ice
p10
aVyou have the unknown,
p11
aVyou have the non-obvious,
p12
aVyou have the non-seen,
p13
aVfor the people who don't dare
p14
aVto go through the ice.
p15
aa(lp16
VThere are so many people
p17
aVwho prefer to suffer in the ice they know
p18
aVinstead of taking the risk of going through the ice
p19
aVto see what there is on the other side.
p20
aVAnd I think that's one of the main problems of our society.
p21
aVWe learn, maybe not the famous TED audience,
p22
aVbut so many other people learn,
p23
aVthat the unknown, the doubts,
p24
aVthe question marks are dangerous.
p25
aVAnd we have to resist to the changes.
p26
aVWe have to keep everything under control.
p27
aVWell, the unknown is part of life.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd in that sense, ballooning is a beautiful metaphor.
p30
aVBecause in the balloon, like in life,
p31
aVwe go very well in unforeseen directions.
p32
aVWe want to go in a direction,
p33
aVbut the winds push us in another direction, like in life.
p34
aVAnd as long as we fight horizontally,
p35
aVagainst life, against the winds,
p36
aVagainst what's happening to us,
p37
aVlife is a nightmare.
p38
aa(lp39
VHow do we steer a balloon?
p40
aVBy understanding that the atmosphere
p41
aVis made out of several different layers of wind
p42
aVwhich all have different direction.
p43
aVSo, then, we understand that if we want to change our trajectory,
p44
aVin life, or in the balloon,
p45
aVwe have to change altitude.
p46
aVChanging altitude, in life,
p47
aVthat means raising to another psychological, philosophical,
p48
aVspiritual level.
p49
aVBut how do we do that?
p50
aa(lp51
VIn ballooning, or in life,
p52
aVhow do we change altitude?
p53
aVHow do we go from the metaphor
p54
aVto something more practical that we can really
p55
aVuse every day?
p56
aVWell, in a balloon it's easy, we have ballast.
p57
aVAnd when we drop the ballast overboard we climb.
p58
aVSand, water, all the equipment we don't need anymore.
p59
aVAnd I think in life it should be exactly like this.
p60
aa(lp61
VYou know, when people speak about pioneering spirit,
p62
aVvery often they believe that pioneers
p63
aVare the ones who have new ideas.
p64
aVIt's not true.
p65
aVThe pioneers are not the ones who have new ideas,
p66
aVbecause new ideas are so easy to have.
p67
aVWe just close our eyes for a minute we all come back
p68
aVwith a lot of new ideas.
p69
aVNo, the pioneer is the one who
p70
aVallows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast.
p71
aVHabits, certainties,
p72
aVconvictions, exclamation marks,
p73
aVparadigms, dogmas.
p74
aVAnd when we are able to do that,
p75
aVwhat happens?
p76
aVLife is not anymore
p77
aVjust one line going in one direction
p78
aVin one dimension. No.
p79
aVLife is going to be made out of all the possible lines
p80
aVthat go in all the possible directions
p81
aVin three dimensions.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves
p84
aVto explore this vertical axis.
p85
aVOf course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon,
p86
aVbut in life itself.
p87
aVExplore this vertical axis, that means
p88
aVexplore all the different ways to do,
p89
aVall the different ways to behave, all the different ways to think,
p90
aVbefore we find the one that goes in the direction we wish.
p91
aVThis is very practical.
p92
aVThis can be in politics.
p93
aVThis can be in spirituality.
p94
aVThis can be in environment,
p95
aVin finance, in education of children.
p96
aa(lp97
VI deeply believe
p98
aVthat life is a much greater adventure
p99
aVif we manage to do politics
p100
aVwithout the trench between the left and the right wing.
p101
aVBecause we will throw away these political dogmas.
p102
aVI deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment
p103
aVif we get rid \u2014 if we throw overboard
p104
aVthis fundamentalism that some of the greens have showed in the past.
p105
aVAnd that we can aim for much higher spirituality
p106
aVif we get rid of the religious dogmas.
p107
aVThrowing overboard, as ballast, to change our direction.
p108
aa(lp109
VWell, these basically are things I believed in such a long time.
p110
aVBut actually I had to go around the world in a balloon
p111
aVto be invited to talk about it.
p112
aV(Laughter)
p113
aV(Applause)
p114
aVIt's clear that it's not easy to know which ballast to drop
p115
aVand which altitude to take. Sometime we need
p116
aVfriends, family members or a psychiatrist.
p117
aVWell, in balloons we need weather men,
p118
aVthe one who calculate the direction of each layer of wind,
p119
aVat which altitude, in order to help the balloonist.
p120
aVBut sometimes it's very paradoxical.
p121
aa(lp122
VWhen Brian Jones and I were flying around the world,
p123
aVthe weather man asked us, one day, to fly
p124
aVquite low, and very slow.
p125
aVAnd when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it
p126
aVaround the world at that speed.
p127
aVSo, we disobeyed. We flew much higher, and double the speed.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd I was so proud to have found that jetstream
p130
aVthat I called the weather man,
p131
aVand I told him, "Hey, guy, don't you think we're good pilots up there?
p132
aVWe fly twice the speed you predicted."
p133
aVAnd he told me, "Don't do that. Go down immediately
p134
aVin order to slow down."
p135
aVAnd I started to argue. I said, "I'm not going to do that.
p136
aVWe don't have enough gas to fly so slow."
p137
aVAnd he told me, "Yes, but with the low pressure you have on your left
p138
aVif you fly too fast, in a couple of hours
p139
aVyou will turn left and end up at the North Pole.
p140
aV(Laughter)
p141
aVAnd then he asked me \u2014
p142
aVand this is something I will never forget in my life \u2014
p143
aVhe just asked me, "You're the good pilot up there.
p144
aVWhat do you really want? You want to go very fast
p145
aVin the wrong direction, or slowly in the good direction?
p146
aV(Laughter)
p147
aV(Applause)
p148
aa(lp149
VAnd this is why you need weathermen.
p150
aVThis is why you need people with long-term vision.
p151
aVAnd this is precisely what fails
p152
aVin the political visions we have now,
p153
aVin the political governments.
p154
aVWe are burning, as you heard,
p155
aVso much energy,
p156
aVnot understanding that such an unsustainable
p157
aVway of life cannot last for long.
p158
aVSo, we went down actually.
p159
aVWe slowed down. And we went through moments of fears
p160
aVbecause we had no idea how the little amount of gas
p161
aVwe had in the balloon
p162
aVcould allow us to travel 45,000 kilometers.
p163
aVBut we were expected to have doubts; we're expected to have fears.
p164
aVAnd actually this is where the adventure really started.
p165
aa(lp166
VWhen we were flying over the Sahara and India
p167
aVit was nice holidays.
p168
aVWe could land anytime and fly back home with an airplane.
p169
aVIn the middle of the Pacific,
p170
aVwhen you don't have the good winds, you cannot land,
p171
aVyou cannot go back.
p172
aVThat's a crisis.
p173
aVThat's the moment when you have to wake up
p174
aVfrom the automatic way of thinking.
p175
aVThat's the moment when you have to motivate
p176
aVyour inner potential,
p177
aVyour creativity.
p178
aVThat's when you throw out all the ballast,
p179
aVall the certainties,
p180
aVin order to adapt to the new situation.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd actually, we changed completely our flight plan.
p183
aVWe changed completely our strategy.
p184
aVAnd after 20 days we landed successfully in Egypt.
p185
aVBut if I show you this picture
p186
aVit's not to tell you how happy we were.
p187
aVIt's to show you how much gas was left
p188
aVin the last bottles.
p189
aVWe took off with 3.7 tons of liquid propane.
p190
aVWe landed with 40 kilos.
p191
aa(lp192
VWhen I saw that, I made a promise to myself.
p193
aVI made a promise that the next time I would fly around the world,
p194
aVit would be with no fuel,
p195
aVindependent from fossil energies,
p196
aVin order to be safe,
p197
aVnot to be threatened by the fuel gauge.
p198
aVI had no idea how it was possible.
p199
aVI just thought it's a dream and I want to do it.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd when the capsule of my balloon was introduced
p202
aVofficially in the Air and Space Museum in Washington,
p203
aVtogether with the airplane of Charles Lindbergh,
p204
aVwith Apollo 11, with the Wright Brothers' Flyer,
p205
aVwith Chuck Yeager's 61,
p206
aVI had really a thought then.
p207
aVI thought, well, the 20th century, that was brilliant.
p208
aVIt allowed to do all those things there.
p209
aVBut it will not be possible in the future any more.
p210
aVIt takes too much energy. It will cost too much.
p211
aVIt will be prohibited
p212
aVbecause we'll have to save our natural resources
p213
aVin a few decades from now.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo how can we perpetuate
p216
aVthis pioneering spirit
p217
aVwith something that will be independent from fossil energy?
p218
aVAnd this is when the project Solar Impulse
p219
aVreally started to
p220
aVturn in my head.
p221
aVAnd I think it's a nice metaphor also
p222
aVfor the 21st century.
p223
aVPioneering spirit should continue, but on another level.
p224
aVNot to conquer the planet or space,
p225
aVnot anymore, it has been done,
p226
aVbut rather to improve the quality of life.
p227
aVHow can we go through the ice of certainty
p228
aVin order to make the most incredible a possible thing?
p229
aVWhat is today completely impossible \u2014
p230
aVget rid of our dependency on fossil energy.
p231
aa(lp232
VIf you tell to people, we want to be independent
p233
aVfrom fossil energy in our world,
p234
aVpeople will laugh at you, except here,
p235
aVwhere crazy people are invited to speak.
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aVSo, the idea is that if we fly around the world
p238
aVin a solar powered airplane,
p239
aVusing absolutely no fuel,
p240
aVnobody ever could say in the future
p241
aVthat it's impossible to do it
p242
aVfor cars, for heating systems,
p243
aVfor computers, and so on and so on.
p244
aa(lp245
VWell, solar power airplanes are not new.
p246
aVThey have flown in the past, but without
p247
aVsaving capabilities, without batteries.
p248
aVWhich means that they have more proven
p249
aVthe limits of renewable energies
p250
aVthan the potential of it.
p251
aVIf we want to show the potential,
p252
aVwe have to fly day and night.
p253
aVThat means to load the batteries during the flight,
p254
aVin order to spend the night on the batteries,
p255
aVand fly the next day again.
p256
aVIt has been made, already, on remote controlled
p257
aVlittle airplane models, without pilots.
p258
aa(lp259
VBut it stays an anecdote
p260
aVbecause the public couldn't identify to it.
p261
aVI think you need a pilot in the plane
p262
aVthat can talk to the universities,
p263
aVthat can talk to students,
p264
aVtalk to politicians during the flight,
p265
aVand really make it a human adventure.
p266
aVFor that, unfortunately,
p267
aVfour meters wingspan is not enough.
p268
aVYou need 64 meter wingspan.
p269
aV64 meter wingspan to carry one pilot, the batteries,
p270
aVflies slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency.
p271
aVWhy that? Because fuel is not easy to replace.
p272
aVThat's for sure.
p273
aVAnd with 200 square meters of solar power on our plane,
p274
aVwe can produce the same energy
p275
aVthan 200 little lightbulbs.
p276
aVThat means a Christmas tree, a big Christmas tree.
p277
aa(lp278
VSo the question is, how can you carry a pilot around the world
p279
aVwith an airplane that uses
p280
aVthe same amount of energy as a big Christmas tree?
p281
aVPeople will tell you it's impossible,
p282
aVand that's exactly why we try to do it.
p283
aVWe launched the project with my colleague Andre Borschberg
p284
aVsix years ago.
p285
aVWe have now 70 people in the team working on it.
p286
aVWe have gone through the stages of simulation, design,
p287
aVcomputing, preparing the construction
p288
aVof the first prototype.
p289
aVThat has been achieved after two years of work.
p290
aVCockpit, propeller, engine.
p291
aVJust the fuselage here, it's so light.
p292
aVIt's not designed by an artist, but it could be.
p293
aV50 kilos for the entire fuselage.
p294
aVCouple of kilos more for the wing spars.
p295
aa(lp296
VThis is the complete structure of the airplane.
p297
aVAnd one month ago we have unveiled it.
p298
aVYou cannot imagine how it is for a team
p299
aVwho has been working six years on it
p300
aVto show that it's not only a dream and a vision,
p301
aVit's a real airplane.
p302
aVA real airplane that we could finally present.
p303
aa(lp304
VAnd what's the goal now?
p305
aVThe goal is to take off,
p306
aVend of this year for the first test,
p307
aVbut mainly next year, spring or summer,
p308
aVtake off, on our own power,
p309
aVwithout additional help, without being towed,
p310
aVclimb to 9,000 meters altitude.
p311
aVThe same time we load the batteries,
p312
aVwe run the engines, and when we get at the maximum height,
p313
aVwe arrive at the beginning of the night.
p314
aVAnd there, there will be just one goal, just one:
p315
aVreach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty.
p316
aV(Laughter)
p317
aa(lp318
VAnd this is exactly the symbol of our world.
p319
aVIf our airplane is too heavy,
p320
aVif the pilot wastes energy,
p321
aVwe'll never make it through the night.
p322
aVAnd in our world, if we keep on spoiling,
p323
aVwasting our energy resources,
p324
aVif we keep on building things that consume so much energy
p325
aVthat most of the companies now go bankrupt,
p326
aVit's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation
p327
aVwithout a major problem.
p328
aa(lp329
VSo, you see that this airplane is more a symbol.
p330
aVI don't think it will transport 200 people
p331
aVin the next years.
p332
aVBut when Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic,
p333
aVthe payload was also just sufficient
p334
aVfor one person and some fuel.
p335
aVAnd 20 years later there were 200 people
p336
aVin every airplane crossing the Atlantic.
p337
aa(lp338
VSo, we have to start,
p339
aVand show the example.
p340
aVA little bit like on this picture here.
p341
aVThis is a painting from Magritte,
p342
aVin the museum in Holland that I love so much.
p343
aVIt's a pipe, and it's written, "This is not a pipe."
p344
aVThis is not an airplane.
p345
aVThis is a symbol of what we can achieve
p346
aVwhen we believe in the impossible,
p347
aVwhen we have a team,
p348
aVwhen we have pioneering spirit,
p349
aVand especially when we understand
p350
aVthat all the certainties we have
p351
aVshould be thrown overboard.
p352
aa(lp353
VWhat pleases me very much
p354
aVis that in the beginning I thought that we would have to fly
p355
aVaround the world with no fuel
p356
aVin order to have our message been understood.
p357
aVAnd more and more, we're invited around the world with Andre
p358
aVto talk about that project, to talk about the symbol of it,
p359
aVinvited by politicians, invited in energy forums,
p360
aVin order to show that it's not anymore
p361
aVcompletely stupid
p362
aVto think about getting rid of the dependency
p363
aVon fossil energies.
p364
aa(lp365
VSo, through speeches like this one today,
p366
aVthrough interviews, through meetings,
p367
aVour goal is to get as many people possible on the team.
p368
aVThe success will not come
p369
aVif we "just," quote, unquote,
p370
aVfly around the world in a solar-powered airplane.
p371
aVNo, the success will come
p372
aVif enough people are motivated
p373
aVto do exactly the same in their daily life,
p374
aVsave energy, go to renewables.
p375
aVAnd this is possible. You know, with the technologies we have today,
p376
aVwe can save between 30 and 50 percent
p377
aVof the energy of a country in Europe,
p378
aVand we can solve half of the rest with renewables.
p379
aVIt leaves 25 or 30 percent for
p380
aVoil, gas, coal, nuclear, or whatever.
p381
aVThis is acceptable.
p382
aa(lp383
VThis is why all the people who believe
p384
aVin this type of spirit
p385
aVare welcome to be on that team.
p386
aVYou can just go on SolarImpulse.com, subscribe
p387
aVto just be informed of what we're doing.
p388
aVBut much more, to get advices,
p389
aVto give your comments, to spread the word
p390
aVthat if it's possible in the air,
p391
aVof course it's possible in the ground.
p392
aa(lp393
VAnd each time we have some ice in the future,
p394
aVwe have to know that life will be great,
p395
aVand the success will be brilliant
p396
aVif we dare to overcome our fear of the ice,
p397
aVto go through the obstacle,
p398
aVto go through the problem, in order to see what there is on the other side.
p399
aVSo, you see, this is what we're doing on our side.
p400
aVEveryone has his goal, has his dreams,
p401
aVhas his visions.
p402
aa(lp403
VThe question I leave you with now
p404
aVis which is the ballast
p405
aVyou would like to throw overboard?
p406
aVWhich will be the altitude at which
p407
aVyou would like to fly in your life,
p408
aVto get to the success that you wish to have,
p409
aVto get to the point that really belongs to you,
p410
aVwith the potential you have,
p411
aVand the one you can really fulfill?
p412
aVBecause the most renewable energy we have
p413
aVis our own potential, and our own passion.
p414
aVSo, let's go for it, and I wish you an excellent adventure
p415
aVin the wings of the future. Thank you.
