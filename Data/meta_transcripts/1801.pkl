aVJulie Taymor: Thank you. Thank you very much.
p12
aVThat's a few samples of the theater, opera
p13
aVand films that I have done over the last 20 years.
p14
aVBut what I'd like to begin with right now
p15
aVis to take you back to a moment
p16
aVthat I went through in Indonesia,
p17
aVwhich is a seminal moment in my life
p18
aVand, like all myths,
p19
aVthese stories need to be retold
p20
aVand told, lest we forget them.
p21
aVAnd when I'm in the turbulent times, as we know,
p22
aVthat I am right now, through the crucible
p23
aVand the fire of transformation,
p24
aVwhich is what all of you do, actually.
p25
aVAnybody who creates knows there's that point where
p26
aVit hasn't quite become the phoenix or the burnt char.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aVAnd I am right there on the edge,
p29
aVwhich I'll tell you about, another story.
p30
aVI want to go back to Indonesia
p31
aVwhere I was about 21, 22 years, a long time ago,
p32
aVon a fellowship.
p33
aVAnd I found myself, after two years there
p34
aVand performing and learning, on the island of Bali,
p35
aVon the edge of a crater, Gunung Batur.
p36
aVAnd I was in a village where there was
p37
aVan initiation ceremony for the young men,
p38
aVa rite of passage.
p39
aVLittle did I know that it was mine as well.
p40
aVAnd as I sat in this temple square
p41
aVunder this gigantic beringin banyan tree,
p42
aVin the dark, there was no electricity, just the full moon,
p43
aVdown in this empty square,
p44
aVand I heard the most beautiful sounds,
p45
aVlike a Charles Ives concert
p46
aVas I listened to the gamelan music
p47
aVfrom all the different villagers that came
p48
aVfor this once-every-five-years ceremony.
p49
aVAnd I thought I was alone in the dark under this tree.
p50
aVAnd all of a sudden, out of the dark,
p51
aVfrom the other end of the square,
p52
aVI saw the glint of mirrors lit by the moon.
p53
aVAnd these 20 old men who I'd seen before
p54
aVall of a sudden stood up in these full warrior costumes
p55
aVwith the headdress and the spears,
p56
aVand no one was in the square, and I was hidden in the shadows.
p57
aVNo one was there, and they came out,
p58
aVand they did this incredible dance.
p59
aV"Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhahahahaha."
p60
aVAnd they moved their bodies and they came forward,
p61
aVand the lights bounced off these costumes.
p62
aVAnd I've been in theater since I was 11 years old,
p63
aVand performing, creating, and I went,
p64
aV"Who are they performing for
p65
aVwith these elaborate costumes,
p66
aVthese extraordinary headdresses?"
p67
aVAnd I realized that they were performing for God,
p68
aVwhatever that means.
p69
aVBut somehow, it didn't matter about the publicity.
p70
aVThere was no money involved.
p71
aVIt wasn't going to be written down. It was no news.
p72
aVAnd there were these incredible artists
p73
aVthat felt for me like an eternity as they performed.
p74
aVThe next moment,
p75
aVas soon as they finished and disappeared into the shadows,
p76
aVa young man with a propane lantern came on,
p77
aVhung it up on a tree, set up a curtain.
p78
aVThe village square was filled with hundreds of people.
p79
aVAnd they put on an opera all night long.
p80
aVHuman beings needed the light.
p81
aVThey needed the light to see.
p82
aVSo what I gained and gathered from this incredible,
p83
aVseminal moment in my life as a young artist
p84
aVwas that you must be true
p85
aVto what you believe as an artist all the way through,
p86
aVbut you also have to be aware
p87
aVthat the audience is out there in our lives at this time,
p88
aVand they also need the light.
p89
aVAnd it's this incredible balance
p90
aVthat I think that we walk
p91
aVwhen we are creating something that is breaking ground,
p92
aVthat's trying to do something you've never seen before,
p93
aVthat imaginary world
p94
aVwhere you actually don't know where you're going to end up,
p95
aVthat's the fine line on the edge of a crater
p96
aVthat I have walked my whole life.
p97
aVWhat I would like to do now is to tell you
p98
aVa little bit
p99
aVabout how I work. Let's take "The Lion King."
p100
aVYou saw many examples of my work up there,
p101
aVbut it's one that people know.
p102
aVI start with the notion of the ideograph.
p103
aVAn ideograph is like a brush painting, a Japanese brush painting.
p104
aVThree strokes, you get the whole bamboo forest.
p105
aVI go to the concept of "The Lion King"
p106
aVand I say, "What is the essence of it?
p107
aVWhat is the abstraction?
p108
aVIf I were to reduce this entire story
p109
aVinto one image, what would it be?"
p110
aVThe circle. The circle. It's so obvious.
p111
aVThe circle of life. The circle of Mufasa's mask.
p112
aVThe circle that, when we come to Act II and there's a drought,
p113
aVhow do you express drought?
p114
aVIt's a circle of silk on the floor
p115
aVthat disappears into the hole in the stage floor.
p116
aVThe circle of life comes in the wheels
p117
aVof the gazelles that leap.
p118
aVAnd you see the mechanics.
p119
aVAnd being a theater person, what I know and love about the theater
p120
aVis that when the audience comes in
p121
aVand they suspend their disbelief,
p122
aVwhen you see men walking or women walking
p123
aVwith a platter of grass on their heads,
p124
aVyou know it's the savanna.
p125
aVYou don't question that.
p126
aVI love the apparent truth of theater.
p127
aVI love that people are willing to fill in the blanks.
p128
aVThe audience is willing to say,
p129
aV"Oh, I know that's not a real sun.
p130
aVYou took pieces of sticks.
p131
aVYou added silk to the bottom.
p132
aVYou suspended these pieces. You let it fall flat on the floor.
p133
aVAnd as it rises with the strings, I see that it's a sun.
p134
aVBut the beauty of it is that it's just silk and sticks.
p135
aVAnd in a way, that is what makes it spiritual.
p136
aVThat's what moves you.
p137
aVIt's not the actual literal sunrise that's coming.
p138
aVIt's the art of it.
p139
aVSo in the theater, as much as the story is critical
p140
aVand the book and the language,
p141
aVthe telling of the story, how it's told,
p142
aVthe mechanics, the methods that you use,
p143
aVis equal to the story itself.
p144
aVAnd I'm one who loves high tech and low tech.
p145
aVSo I could go from \u2014
p146
aVFor instance, I'll show you some "Spider-Man" later,
p147
aVthese incredible machines that move people along.
p148
aVBut the fact is, without the dancer
p149
aVwho knows how to use his body and swing on those wires,
p150
aVit's nothing.
p151
aVSo now I'm going to show you
p152
aVsome clips from the other big project of my life this year,
p153
aV"The Tempest."
p154
aVIt's a movie. I did "The Tempest" on a stage three times
p155
aVin the theater since 1984, '86,
p156
aVand I love the play.
p157
aVI did it always with a male Prospero.
p158
aVAnd all of a sudden, I thought,
p159
aV"Well, who am I gonna get to play Prospero?
p160
aVWhy not Helen Mirren? She's a great actor. Why not?"
p161
aVAnd this material really did work for a woman equally as well.
p162
aVSo now, let's take a look at some of the images
p163
aVfrom "The Tempest."
p164
aV(Music)
p165
aV(Video) Prospera: Hast thou, spirit, performed to the point the tempest that I bade thee?
p166
aVAriel: I boarded the king's ship. In every cabin, I flamed amazement.
p167
aVProspera: At first sight, they have changed eyes.
p168
aVMiranda: Do you love me?
p169
aVFerdinand: Beyond all limit.
p170
aVHM: They are both in either's powers.
p171
aVTrinculo: Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows.
p172
aV(Music)
p173
aVLooking for business, governor?
p174
aVCaliban: Hast thou not dropped from heaven?
p175
aVStephano: Out of the moon, I do assure thee.
p176
aVProspera: Caliban!
p177
aVCaliban: This island is mine.
p178
aVProspera: For this, be sure, tonight thou shalt have cramps.
p179
aVAntonio: Here lies your brother no better than the earth he lies upon.
p180
aVSebastian: Draw thy sword.
p181
aVAnd I, the king, shall love thee.
p182
aVProspera: I will plague them all, even to roaring.
p183
aVAriel: I have made you mad.
p184
aVProspera: We are such stuff as dreams are made on.
p185
aVand our little life is rounded with a sleep.
p186
aV(Music)
p187
aVJT: Okay.
p188
aV(Applause)
p189
aVSo I went from theater, doing "The Tempest"
p190
aVon the stage in a very low-budget production
p191
aVmany years ago,
p192
aVand I love the play, and I also think
p193
aVit's Shakespeare's last play,
p194
aVand it really lends itself, as you can see, to cinema.
p195
aVBut I'm just going to give you a little example about
p196
aVhow one stages it in theater
p197
aVand then how one takes that same idea or story
p198
aVand moves it into cinema.
p199
aVThe ideograph that I talked to you about before,
p200
aVwhat is it for "The Tempest"?
p201
aVWhat, if I were to boil it down,
p202
aVwould be the one image that I could
p203
aVhang my hat on for this?
p204
aVAnd it was the sand castle,
p205
aVthe idea of nurture versus nature,
p206
aVthat we build these civilizations \u2014
p207
aVshe speaks about it at the end, Helen Mirren's Prospera \u2014
p208
aVwe build them, but under nature, under the grand tempest,
p209
aVthese cloud-capped towers, these gorgeous palaces will fade
p210
aVand there will \u2014 leave not a rack behind.
p211
aVSo in the theater, I started the play,
p212
aVit was a black sand rake, white cyc,
p213
aVand there was a little girl, Miranda, on the horizon,
p214
aVbuilding a drip castle, a sand castle.
p215
aVAnd as she was there on the edge of that stage,
p216
aVtwo stagehands all in black
p217
aVwith watering cans ran along the top
p218
aVand started to pour water on the sand castle,
p219
aVand the sand castle started to drip and sink,
p220
aVbut before it did,
p221
aVthe audience saw the black-clad stagehands.
p222
aVThe medium was apparent. It was banal. We saw it.
p223
aVBut as they started to pour the water,
p224
aVthe light changed from showing you the black-clad stagehands
p225
aVto focusing, this rough magic that we do in theater,
p226
aVit focused right on the water itself.
p227
aVAnd all of a sudden, the audience's perspective changes.
p228
aVIt becomes something magically large.
p229
aVIt becomes the rainstorm.
p230
aVThe masked actors, the puppeteers, they disappear,
p231
aVand the audience makes that leap into this world,
p232
aVinto this imaginary world of "The Tempest" actually happening.
p233
aVNow the difference
p234
aVwhen I went and did it in the cinema,
p235
aVI started the actual movie
p236
aVwith a close-up of a sand castle, a black sand castle,
p237
aVand what cinema can do is,
p238
aVby using camera, perspective,
p239
aVand also long shots and close-ups,
p240
aVit started on a close-up of the sand castle,
p241
aVand as it pulled away,
p242
aVyou saw that it was a miniature sitting in the palm
p243
aVof the girl's hands.
p244
aVAnd so I could play with the medium,
p245
aVand why I move from one medium to another
p246
aVis to be able to do this.
p247
aVNow I'm going to take you to "Spider-Man."
p248
aV(Music)
p249
aV(Video) Peter Parker: \u266a Standing on the precipice,
p250
aVI can soar away from this. \u266a
p251
aVJT: We're trying to do everything in live theater
p252
aVthat you can't do in two dimensions
p253
aVin film and television.
p254
aVPP: \u266a Rise above yourself and take control. \u266a
p255
aVGeorge Tsypin: We're looking at New York from a Spider-Man point of view.
p256
aVSpider Man is not bound by gravity.
p257
aVManhattan in the show is not bound by gravity either.
p258
aVPP: \u266a Be yourself and rise above it all. \u266a
p259
aVEnsemble: \u266a Sock! Pow! \u266a
p260
aV\u266a Slam! Scratch! \u266a
p261
aVDanny Ezralow: I don't want you to even think there's a choreographer.
p262
aVIt's real, what's happening.
p263
aVI prefer you to see people moving,
p264
aVand you're going, "Whoa, what was that?"
p265
aV(Music)
p266
aVJT: If I give enough movement in the sculpture,
p267
aVand the actor moves their head, you feel like it's alive.
p268
aVIt's really comic book live. It's a comic book coming alive.
p269
aV(Music)
p270
aVBono: They're mythologies.
p271
aVThey're modern myths, these comic book heroes.
p272
aVPP: \u266a They believe. \u266a
p273
aV(Screams)
p274
aV(Music)
p275
aV(Applause)
p276
aVJT: Ohhhh. What was that?
p277
aVCircus, rock 'n' roll, drama.
p278
aVWhat the hell are we doing up there on that stage?
p279
aVWell, one last story, very quickly.
p280
aVAfter I was in that village, I crossed the lake,
p281
aVand I saw that the volcano was erupting
p282
aVon the other side, Gunung Batur,
p283
aVand there was a dead volcano next to the live volcano.
p284
aVI didn't think I'd be swallowed by the volcano,
p285
aVand I am here.
p286
aVBut it's very easy to climb up, is it not?
p287
aVYou hold on to the roots,
p288
aVyou put your foot in the little rocks
p289
aVand climb up there, and you get to the top,
p290
aVand I was with a good friend who was an actor,
p291
aVand we said, "Let's go up there.
p292
aVLet's see if we can come close to the edge
p293
aVof that live volcano."
p294
aVAnd we climbed up and we got to the very top,
p295
aVand we're on the edge, on this precipice,
p296
aVRoland disappears into the sulfur smoke
p297
aVat the volcano at the other end,
p298
aVand I'm up there alone
p299
aVon this incredible precipice.
p300
aVDid you hear the lyrics?
p301
aVI'm on the precipice looking down
p302
aVinto a dead volcano to my left.
p303
aVTo my right is sheer shale. It's coming off.
p304
aVI'm in thongs and sarongs. It was many years ago.
p305
aVAnd no hiking boots.
p306
aVAnd he's disappeared, this mad French gypsy actor,
p307
aVoff in the smoke, and I realize,
p308
aVI can't go back the way that I've come. I can't.
p309
aVSo I throw away my camera. I throw away my thongs,
p310
aVand I looked at the line straight in front of me,
p311
aVand I got down on all fours like a cat,
p312
aVand I held with my knees to either side
p313
aVof this line in front of me,
p314
aVfor 30 yards or 30 feet, I don't know.
p315
aVThe wind was massively blowing,
p316
aVand the only way I could get to the other side
p317
aVwas to look at the line straight in front of me.
p318
aVI know you've all been there.
p319
aVI'm in the crucible right now.
p320
aVIt's my trial by fire.
p321
aVIt's my company's trials by fire.
p322
aVWe survive because our theme song is "Rise Above."
p323
aVBoy falls from the sky, rise above.
p324
aVIt's right there in the palm of both of our hands,
p325
aVof all of my company's hands.
p326
aVI have beautiful collaborators, and we as creators
p327
aVonly get there all together.
p328
aVI know you understand that.
p329
aVAnd you just stay going forward,
p330
aVand then you see this extraordinary thing
p331
aVin front of your eyes.
p332
aVThank you.
