VI was born and raised in North Korea.
p4
aVAlthough my family constantly struggled against poverty,
p5
aVI was always loved and cared for first,
p6
aVbecause I was the only son
p7
aVand the youngest of two in the family.
p8
aa(lp9
VBut then the great famine began in 1994.
p10
aVI was four years old.
p11
aVMy sister and I would go searching for firewood
p12
aVstarting at 5 in the morning
p13
aVand come back after midnight.
p14
aVI would wander the streets searching for food,
p15
aVand I remember seeing a small child
p16
aVtied to a mother's back eating chips,
p17
aVand wanting to steal them from him.
p18
aa(lp19
VHunger is humiliation. Hunger is hopelessness.
p20
aVFor a hungry child, politics and freedom
p21
aVare not even thought of.
p22
aVOn my ninth birthday, my parents
p23
aVcouldn't give me any food to eat.
p24
aVBut even as a child, I could feel the heaviness
p25
aVin their hearts.
p26
aa(lp27
VOver a million North Koreans died of starvation in that time,
p28
aVand in 2003, when I was 13 years old,
p29
aVmy father became one of them.
p30
aVI saw my father wither away and die.
p31
aVIn the same year, my mother disappeared one day,
p32
aVand then my sister told me
p33
aVthat she was going to China to earn money,
p34
aVbut that she would return with money and food soon.
p35
aVSince we had never been separated,
p36
aVand I thought we would be together forever,
p37
aVI didn't even give her a hug when she left.
p38
aVIt was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life.
p39
aVBut again, I didn't know
p40
aVit was going to be a long goodbye.
p41
aVI have not seen my mom or my sister since then.
p42
aa(lp43
VSuddenly, I became an orphan and homeless.
p44
aVMy daily life became very hard,
p45
aVbut very simple.
p46
aVMy goal was to find a dusty piece of bread in the trash.
p47
aVBut that is no way to survive.
p48
aVI started to realize, begging would not be the solution.
p49
aVSo I started to steal from food carts in illegal markets.
p50
aVSometimes, I found small jobs
p51
aVin exchange for food.
p52
aVOnce, I even spent two months in the winter
p53
aVworking in a coal mine,
p54
aV33 meters underground without any protection
p55
aVfor up to 16 hours a day.
p56
aVI was not uncommon.
p57
aVMany other orphans survived this way, or worse.
p58
aa(lp59
VWhen I could not fall asleep from bitter cold
p60
aVor hunger pains,
p61
aVI hoped that, the next morning,
p62
aVmy sister would come back to wake me up
p63
aVwith my favorite food.
p64
aVThat hope kept me alive.
p65
aVI don't mean big, grand hope.
p66
aVI mean the kind of hope that made me believe
p67
aVthat the next trash can had bread,
p68
aVeven though it usually didn't.
p69
aVBut if I didn't believe it, I wouldn't even try,
p70
aVand then I would die.
p71
aVHope kept me alive.
p72
aVEvery day, I told myself,
p73
aVno matter how hard things got,
p74
aVstill I must live.
p75
aa(lp76
VAfter three years of waiting for my sister's return,
p77
aVI decided to go to China to look for her myself.
p78
aVI realized
p79
aVI couldn't survive much longer this way.
p80
aVI knew the journey would be risky,
p81
aVbut I would be risking my life either way.
p82
aVI could die of starvation like my father in North Korea,
p83
aVor at least I could try for a better life
p84
aVby escaping to China.
p85
aa(lp86
VI had learned that many people tried to cross
p87
aVthe border to China in the nighttime to avoid being seen.
p88
aVNorth Korean border guards often shoot and kill people
p89
aVtrying to cross the border without permission.
p90
aVChinese soldiers will catch
p91
aVand send back North Koreans,
p92
aVwhere they face severe punishment.
p93
aVI decided to cross during the day,
p94
aVfirst because I was still a kid and scared of the dark,
p95
aVsecond because I knew I was already taking a risk,
p96
aVand since not many people tried to cross during the day,
p97
aVI thought I might be able to cross
p98
aVwithout being seen by anyone.
p99
aa(lp100
VI made it to China on February 15, 2006.
p101
aVI was 16 years old.
p102
aVI thought things in China would be easier,
p103
aVsince there was more food.
p104
aVI thought more people would help me.
p105
aVBut it was harder than living in North Korea,
p106
aVbecause I was not free.
p107
aVI was always worried about being caught
p108
aVand sent back.
p109
aa(lp110
VBy a miracle, some months later,
p111
aVI met someone who was running
p112
aVan underground shelter for North Koreans,
p113
aVand was allowed to live there
p114
aVand eat regular meals for the first time in many years.
p115
aVLater that year, an activist helped me escape China
p116
aVand go to the United States as a refugee.
p117
aa(lp118
VI went to America without knowing a word of English,
p119
aVyet my social worker told me that I had to go to high school.
p120
aVEven in North Korea, I was an F student.
p121
aV(Laughter)
p122
aVAnd I barely finished elementary school.
p123
aVAnd I remember I fought in school more than once a day.
p124
aVTextbooks and the library were not my playground.
p125
aVMy father tried very hard to motivate me into studying,
p126
aVbut it didn't work.
p127
aVAt one point, my father gave up on me.
p128
aVHe said, "You're not my son anymore."
p129
aVI was only 11 or 12, but it hurt me deeply.
p130
aVBut nevertheless, my level of motivation
p131
aVstill didn't change before he died.
p132
aVSo in America, it was kind of ridiculous
p133
aVthat they said I should go to high school.
p134
aVI didn't even go to middle school.
p135
aVI decided to go, just because they told me to,
p136
aVwithout trying much.
p137
aa(lp138
VBut one day, I came home and my foster mother
p139
aVhad made chicken wings for dinner.
p140
aVAnd during dinner, I wanted to have one more wing,
p141
aVbut I realized there were not enough for everyone,
p142
aVso I decided against it.
p143
aVWhen I looked down at my plate,
p144
aVI saw the last chicken wing, that my foster father had given me his.
p145
aVI was so happy.
p146
aVI looked at him sitting next to me.
p147
aVHe just looked back at me very warmly,
p148
aVbut said no words.
p149
aVSuddenly I remembered my biological father.
p150
aVMy foster father's small act of love
p151
aVreminded me of my father,
p152
aVwho would love to share his food with me
p153
aVwhen he was hungry, even if he was starving.
p154
aVI felt so suffocated that I had so much food in America,
p155
aVyet my father died of starvation.
p156
aVMy only wish that night was to cook a meal for him,
p157
aVand that night I also thought of what else I could do
p158
aVto honor him.
p159
aVAnd my answer was to promise to myself
p160
aVthat I would study hard and get the best education
p161
aVin America to honor his sacrifice.
p162
aa(lp163
VI took school seriously,
p164
aVand for the first time ever in my life,
p165
aVI received an academic award for excellence,
p166
aVand made dean's list from the first semester in high school.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Applause)
p169
aa(lp170
VThat chicken wing changed my life.
p171
aV(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VHope is personal. Hope is something
p174
aVthat no one can give to you.
p175
aVYou have to choose to believe in hope.
p176
aVYou have to make it yourself.
p177
aVIn North Korea, I made it myself.
p178
aVHope brought me to America.
p179
aVBut in America, I didn't know what to do,
p180
aVbecause I had this overwhelming freedom.
p181
aVMy foster father at that dinner gave me a direction,
p182
aVand he motivated me and gave me a purpose
p183
aVto live in America.
p184
aa(lp185
VI did not come here by myself.
p186
aVI had hope, but hope by itself is not enough.
p187
aVMany people helped me along the way to get here.
p188
aVNorth Koreans are fighting hard to survive.
p189
aVThey have to force themselves to survive,
p190
aVhave hope to survive,
p191
aVbut they cannot make it without help.
p192
aa(lp193
VThis is my message to you.
p194
aVHave hope for yourself,
p195
aVbut also help each other.
p196
aVLife can be hard for everyone, wherever you live.
p197
aVMy foster father didn't intend to change my life.
p198
aVIn the same way, you may also change someone's life
p199
aVwith even the smallest act of love.
p200
aVA piece of bread can satisfy your hunger,
p201
aVand having the hope will bring you bread
p202
aVto keep you alive.
p203
aVBut I confidently believe that
p204
aVyour act of love and caring
p205
aVcan also save another Joseph's life
p206
aVand change thousands of other Josephs
p207
aVwho are still having hope to survive.
p208
aa(lp209
VThank you.
p210
aa(lp211
V(Applause)
p212
aa(lp213
VAdrian Hong: Joseph, thank you for sharing
p214
aVthat very personal and special story with us.
p215
aVI know you haven't seen your sister for, you said,
p216
aVit was almost exactly a decade,
p217
aVand in the off chance that she may be able to see this,
p218
aVwe wanted to give you an opportunity
p219
aVto send her a message.
p220
aa(lp221
VJoseph Kim: In Korean?
p222
aa(lp223
VAH: You can do English, then Korean as well.
p224
aa(lp225
V(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VJK: Okay, I'm not going to make it any longer in Korean
p228
aVbecause I don't think I can make it
p229
aVwithout tearing up.
p230
aa(lp231
VNuna, it has been already 10 years
p232
aVthat I haven\u2019t seen you.
p233
aVI just wanted to say
p234
aVthat I miss you, and I love you,
p235
aVand please come back to me and stay alive.
p236
aVAnd I \u2014 oh, gosh.
p237
aVI still haven't given up my hope to see you.
p238
aVI will live my life happily
p239
aVand study hard
p240
aVuntil I see you,
p241
aVand I promise I will not cry again.
p242
aV(Laughter)
p243
aVYes, I'm just looking forward to seeing you,
p244
aVand if you can't find me,
p245
aVI will also look for you,
p246
aVand I hope to see you one day.
p247
aVAnd can I also make a small message to my mom?
p248
aa(lp249
VAH: Sure, please.
p250
aa(lp251
VJK: I haven't spent much time with you,
p252
aVbut I know that you still love me,
p253
aVand you probably still pray for me
p254
aVand think about me.
p255
aVI just wanted to say thank you
p256
aVfor letting me be in this world.
p257
aVThank you.
