VI wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress
p4
aVtell a very well known interviewer on television,
p5
aV"I'm really getting into the Internet lately.
p6
aVI just wish it were more organized."
p7
aVSo ...
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVIf I controlled the Internet,
p10
aVyou could auction your broken heart on eBay.
p11
aVTake the money; go to Amazon;
p12
aVbuy a phonebook for a country you've never been to \u2014 call folks at random
p13
aVuntil you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language.
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VIf I were in charge of the Internet,
p18
aVyou could Mapquest your lover's mood swings.
p19
aVHang left at cranky, right at preoccupied,
p20
aVU-turn on silent treatment,
p21
aVall the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin'.
p22
aVYou could navigate and understand every emotional intersection.
p23
aVSome days, I'm as shallow as a baking pan,
p24
aVbut I still stretch miles in all directions.
p25
aVIf I owned the Internet, Napster, Monster and Friendster.com
p26
aVwould be one big website.
p27
aVThat way you could listen to cool music
p28
aVwhile you pretend to look for a job
p29
aVand you're really just chattin' with your pals.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VHeck, if I ran the Web, you could email dead people.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VThey would not email you back
p38
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p39
aVbut you'd get an automated reply.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aVTheir name in your inbox
p43
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p44
aVit's all you wanted anyway.
p45
aVAnd a message saying, "Hey, it's me. I miss you.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VListen, you'll see being dead is dandy.
p50
aVNow you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy."
p51
aVIf I designed the Internet, childhood.com would be a loop
p52
aVof a boy in an orchard, with a ski pole for a sword,
p53
aVtrashcan lid for a shield, shouting, "I am the emperor of oranges.
p54
aVI am the emperor of oranges. I am the emperor of oranges."
p55
aVNow follow me, OK?
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VGrandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions.
p60
aVOne, two, three.
p61
aVThat links with hotdiggitydog.com.
p62
aVThat is my grandfather.
p63
aVThey take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriage.dad.
p64
aVHe forms an attachment to
p65
aVkind-of-ditzy-but-still-sends-ginger-snaps-for-Christmas.mom,
p66
aVwho downloads the boy in the orchard, the emperor of oranges,
p67
aVwho grows up to be me \u2014
p68
aVthe guy who usually goes too far.
p69
aVSo if I were emperor of the Internet,
p70
aVI guess I'd still be mortal, huh?
p71
aVBut at that point, I would probably
p72
aValready have the lowest possible mortgage
p73
aVand the most enlarged possible penis
p74
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p75
aVso I would outlaw spam on my first day in office.
p76
aVI wouldn't need it.
p77
aVI'd be like some kind of Internet genius, and me,
p78
aVI'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that \u2014
p79
aVpop! \u2014 I'd go wireless.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VHuh? Maybe Google would hire this.
p84
aVI could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus
p85
aVuntil the World Wide Web is as wise, as wild and as organized
p86
aVas I think a modern-day miracle/oracle can get, but, ooh-eee,
p87
aVyou want to bet just how whack and un-PC
p88
aVyour Mac or PC is going to be when I'm rocking
p89
aVhot-shit-hot-shot-god.net?
p90
aVI guess it's just like life.
p91
aVIt is not a question of if you can \u2014
p92
aVit's: do ya?
p93
aVWe can interfere with the interface.
p94
aVWe can make "You've got Hallelujah" the national anthem of cyberspace
p95
aVevery lucky time we log on.
p96
aVYou don't say a prayer.
p97
aVYou don't write a psalm.
p98
aVYou don't chant an "om."
p99
aVYou send one blessed email to whomever you're thinking of
p100
aVat dah-da-la-dat-da-dah-da-la-dat.com.
p101
aVThank you, TED.
