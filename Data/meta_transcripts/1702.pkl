VOnce upon a time,
p4
aVthere was a place called Lesterland.
p5
aVNow Lesterland looks a lot like the United States.
p6
aVLike the United States, it has about 311 million people,
p7
aVand of that 311 million people,
p8
aVit turns out 144,000 are called Lester.
p9
aVIf Matt's in the audience,
p10
aVI just borrowed that, I'll return it in a second,
p11
aVthis character from your series.
p12
aVSo 144,000 are called Lester,
p13
aVwhich means about .05 percent is named Lester.
p14
aVNow, Lesters in Lesterland have this extraordinary power.
p15
aVThere are two elections every election cycle in Lesterland.
p16
aVOne is called the general election.
p17
aVThe other is called the Lester election.
p18
aVAnd in the general election, it's the citizens who get to vote,
p19
aVbut in the Lester election, it's the Lesters who get to vote.
p20
aVAnd here's the trick.
p21
aVIn order to run in the general election,
p22
aVyou must do extremely well
p23
aVin the Lester election.
p24
aVYou don't necessarily have to win, but you must do extremely well.
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, what can we say about democracy in Lesterland?
p27
aVWhat we can say, number one,
p28
aVas the Supreme Court said in Citizens United,
p29
aVthat people have the ultimate influence over elected officials,
p30
aVbecause, after all, there is a general election,
p31
aVbut only after the Lesters have had their way
p32
aVwith the candidates who wish to run in the general election.
p33
aVAnd number two, obviously, this dependence upon the Lesters
p34
aVis going to produce a subtle, understated,
p35
aVwe could say camouflaged, bending
p36
aVto keep the Lesters happy.
p37
aVOkay, so we have a democracy, no doubt,
p38
aVbut it's dependent upon the Lesters
p39
aVand dependent upon the people.
p40
aVIt has competing dependencies,
p41
aVwe could say conflicting dependencies,
p42
aVdepending upon who the Lesters are.
p43
aVOkay. That's Lesterland.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow there are three things I want you to see now that I've described Lesterland.
p46
aVNumber one, the United States is Lesterland.
p47
aVThe United States is Lesterland.
p48
aVThe United States also looks like this, also has two elections,
p49
aVone we called the general election,
p50
aVthe second we should call the money election.
p51
aVIn the general election, it's the citizens who get to vote,
p52
aVif you're over 18, in some states if you have an ID.
p53
aVIn the money election, it's the funders who get to vote,
p54
aVthe funders who get to vote, and just like in Lesterland,
p55
aVthe trick is, to run in the general election,
p56
aVyou must do extremely well in the money election.
p57
aVYou don't necessarily have to win. There is Jerry Brown.
p58
aVBut you must do extremely well.
p59
aVAnd here's the key: There are just as few relevant funders
p60
aVin USA-land as there are Lesters in Lesterland.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow you say, really?
p63
aVReally .05 percent?
p64
aVWell, here are the numbers from 2010:
p65
aV.26 percent of America
p66
aVgave 200 dollars or more to any federal candidate,
p67
aV.05 percent gave the maximum amount to any federal candidate,
p68
aV.01 percent \u2014 the one percent of the one percent \u2014
p69
aVgave 10,000 dollars or more to federal candidates,
p70
aVand in this election cycle, my favorite statistic
p71
aVis .000042 percent
p72
aV\u2014 for those of you doing the numbers, you know that's 132 Americans \u2014
p73
aVgave 60 percent of the Super PAC money spent
p74
aVin the cycle we have just seen ending.
p75
aVSo I'm just a lawyer, I look at this range of numbers,
p76
aVand I say it's fair for me to say
p77
aVit's .05 percent who are our relevant funders in America.
p78
aVIn this sense, the funders are our Lesters.
p79
aa(lp80
VNow, what can we say about this democracy in USA-land?
p81
aVWell, as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United,
p82
aVwe could say, of course the people have the ultimate influence
p83
aVover the elected officials. We have a general election,
p84
aVbut only after the funders have had their way
p85
aVwith the candidates who wish to run in that general election.
p86
aVAnd number two, obviously,
p87
aVthis dependence upon the funders
p88
aVproduces a subtle, understated, camouflaged bending
p89
aVto keep the funders happy.
p90
aVCandidates for Congress and members of Congress
p91
aVspend between 30 and 70 percent of their time
p92
aVraising money to get back to Congress
p93
aVor to get their party back into power,
p94
aVand the question we need to ask is, what does it do to them,
p95
aVthese humans, as they spend their time
p96
aVbehind the telephone, calling people they've never met,
p97
aVbut calling the tiniest slice of the one percent?
p98
aVAs anyone would, as they do this,
p99
aVthey develop a sixth sense, a constant awareness
p100
aVabout how what they do might affect their ability to raise money.
p101
aVThey become, in the words of "The X-Files,"
p102
aVshape-shifters, as they constantly adjust their views
p103
aVin light of what they know will help them to raise money,
p104
aVnot on issues one to 10,
p105
aVbut on issues 11 to 1,000.
p106
aVLeslie Byrne, a Democrat from Virginia,
p107
aVdescribes that when she went to Congress,
p108
aVshe was told by a colleague, "Always lean to the green."
p109
aVThen to clarify, she went on,
p110
aV"He was not an environmentalist." (Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VSo here too we have a democracy,
p113
aVa democracy dependent upon the funders
p114
aVand dependent upon the people,
p115
aVcompeting dependencies,
p116
aVpossibly conflicting dependencies
p117
aVdepending upon who the funders are.
p118
aa(lp119
VOkay, the United States is Lesterland, point number one.
p120
aVHere's point number two.
p121
aVThe United States is worse than Lesterland,
p122
aVworse than Lesterland because you can imagine in Lesterland
p123
aVif we Lesters got a letter from the government that said,
p124
aV"Hey, you get to pick who gets to run in the general election,"
p125
aVwe would think maybe of a kind of aristocracy of Lesters.
p126
aVYou know, there are Lesters from every part of social society.
p127
aVThere are rich Lesters, poor Lesters, black Lesters, white Lesters,
p128
aVnot many women Lesters, but put that to the side for one second.
p129
aVWe have Lesters from everywhere. We could think,
p130
aV"What could we do to make Lesterland better?"
p131
aVIt's at least possible the Lesters would act for the good of Lesterland.
p132
aVBut in our land, in this land, in USA-land,
p133
aVthere are certainly some sweet Lesters out there,
p134
aVmany of them in this room here today,
p135
aVbut the vast majority of Lesters act for the Lesters,
p136
aVbecause the shifting coalitions that are comprising the .05 percent
p137
aVare not comprising it for the public interest.
p138
aVIt's for their private interest. In this sense, the USA is worse than Lesterland.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd finally, point number three:
p141
aVWhatever one wants to say about Lesterland,
p142
aVagainst the background of its history, its traditions,
p143
aVin our land, in USA-land, Lesterland is a corruption,
p144
aVa corruption.
p145
aVNow, by corruption I don't mean brown paper bag cash
p146
aVsecreted among members of Congress.
p147
aVI don't mean Rod Blagojevich sense of corruption.
p148
aVI don't mean any criminal act.
p149
aVThe corruption I'm talking about is perfectly legal.
p150
aVIt's a corruption relative to the framers' baseline for this republic.
p151
aVThe framers gave us what they called a republic,
p152
aVbut by a republic they meant a representative democracy,
p153
aVand by a representative democracy, they meant a government,
p154
aVas Madison put it in Federalist 52, that would have a branch
p155
aVthat would be dependent upon the people alone.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo here's the model of government.
p158
aVThey have the people and the government
p159
aVwith this exclusive dependency,
p160
aVbut the problem here is that Congress has evolved a different dependence,
p161
aVno longer a dependence upon the people alone,
p162
aVincreasingly a dependence upon the funders.
p163
aVNow this is a dependence too,
p164
aVbut it's different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone
p165
aVso long as the funders are not the people.
p166
aVThis is a corruption.
p167
aa(lp168
VNow, there's good news and bad news about this corruption.
p169
aVOne bit of good news is that it's bipartisan,
p170
aVequal-opportunity corruption.
p171
aVIt blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about.
p172
aVIt blocks the right too, as it makes
p173
aVprincipled arguments of the right increasingly impossible.
p174
aVSo the right wants smaller government.
p175
aVWhen Al Gore was Vice President, his team had an idea
p176
aVfor deregulating a significant portion of the telecommunications industry.
p177
aVThe chief policy man took this idea to Capitol Hill,
p178
aVand as he reported back to me,
p179
aVthe response was, "Hell no!
p180
aVIf we deregulate these guys,
p181
aVhow are we going to raise money from them?"
p182
aa(lp183
VThis is a system that's designed to save the status quo,
p184
aVincluding the status quo of big and invasive government.
p185
aVIt works against the left and the right,
p186
aVand that, you might say, is good news.
p187
aa(lp188
VBut here's the bad news.
p189
aVIt's a pathological, democracy-destroying corruption,
p190
aVbecause in any system
p191
aVwhere the members are dependent upon
p192
aVthe tiniest fraction of us for their election,
p193
aVthat means the tiniest number of us,
p194
aVthe tiniest, tiniest number of us,
p195
aVcan block reform.
p196
aVI know that should have been, like, a rock or something.
p197
aVI can only find cheese. I'm sorry. So there it is.
p198
aVBlock reform.
p199
aa(lp200
VBecause there is an economy here, an economy of influence,
p201
aVan economy with lobbyists at the center
p202
aVwhich feeds on polarization.
p203
aVIt feeds on dysfunction.
p204
aVThe worse that it is for us,
p205
aVthe better that it is for this fundraising.
p206
aa(lp207
VHenry David Thoreau: "There are a thousand hacking
p208
aVat the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root."
p209
aVThis is the root.
p210
aa(lp211
VOkay, now, every single one of you knows this.
p212
aVYou couldn't be here if you didn't know this, yet you ignore it.
p213
aVYou ignore it. This is an impossible problem.
p214
aVYou focus on the possible problems,
p215
aVlike eradicating polio from the world,
p216
aVor taking an image of every single street across the globe,
p217
aVor building the first real universal translator,
p218
aVor building a fusion factory in your garage.
p219
aVThese are the manageable problems, so you ignore \u2014
p220
aV(Laughter) (Applause) \u2014
p221
aVso you ignore this corruption.
p222
aa(lp223
VBut we cannot ignore this corruption anymore.
p224
aV(Applause)
p225
aVWe need a government that works.
p226
aVAnd not works for the left or the right,
p227
aVbut works for the left and the right,
p228
aVthe citizens of the left and right,
p229
aVbecause there is no sensible reform possible
p230
aVuntil we end this corruption.
p231
aVSo I want you to take hold, to grab the issue you care the most about.
p232
aVClimate change is mine, but it might be financial reform
p233
aVor a simpler tax system or inequality.
p234
aVGrab that issue, sit it down in front of you,
p235
aVlook straight in its eyes, and tell it there is no Christmas this year.
p236
aVThere will never be a Christmas.
p237
aVWe will never get your issue solved
p238
aVuntil we fix this issue first.
p239
aVSo it's not that mine is the most important issue. It's not.
p240
aVYours is the most important issue, but mine is the first issue,
p241
aVthe issue we have to solve before we get to fix
p242
aVthe issues you care about.
p243
aVNo sensible reform, and we cannot afford
p244
aVa world, a future, with no sensible reform.
p245
aa(lp246
VOkay. So how do we do it?
p247
aVTurns out, the analytics here are easy, simple.
p248
aVIf the problem is members spending an extraordinary
p249
aVamount of time fundraising from the tiniest slice of America,
p250
aVthe solution is to have them spend less time fundraising
p251
aVbut fundraise from a wider slice of Americans,
p252
aVto spread it out,
p253
aVto spread the funder influence so that we restore the idea
p254
aVof dependence upon the people alone.
p255
aVAnd to do this does not require a constitutional amendment,
p256
aVchanging the First Amendment.
p257
aVTo do this would require a single statute,
p258
aVa statute establishing what we think of
p259
aVas small dollar funded elections,
p260
aVa statute of citizen-funded campaigns,
p261
aVand there's any number of these proposals out there:
p262
aVFair Elections Now Act,
p263
aVthe American Anti-Corruption Act,
p264
aVan idea in my book that I call the Grant and Franklin Project
p265
aVto give vouchers to people to fund elections,
p266
aVan idea of John Sarbanes called the Grassroots Democracy Act.
p267
aVEach of these would fix this corruption
p268
aVby spreading out the influence of funders to all of us.
p269
aa(lp270
VThe analytics are easy here.
p271
aVIt's the politics that's hard, indeed impossibly hard,
p272
aVbecause this reform would shrink K Street,
p273
aVand Capitol Hill, as Congressman Jim Cooper,
p274
aVa Democrat from Tennessee, put it,
p275
aVhas become a farm league for K Street, a farm league for K Street.
p276
aVMembers and staffers and bureaucrats have
p277
aVan increasingly common business model in their head,
p278
aVa business model focused on their life after government,
p279
aVtheir life as lobbyists.
p280
aVFifty percent of the Senate between 1998 and 2004
p281
aVleft to become lobbyists, 42 percent of the House.
p282
aVThose numbers have only gone up,
p283
aVand as United Republic calculated last April,
p284
aVthe average increase in salary for those who they tracked
p285
aVwas 1,452 percent.
p286
aVSo it's fair to ask, how is it possible for them to change this?
p287
aVNow I get this skepticism.
p288
aa(lp289
VI get this cynicism. I get this sense of impossibility.
p290
aVBut I don't buy it.
p291
aVThis is a solvable issue.
p292
aVIf you think about the issues our parents tried to solve
p293
aVin the 20th century,
p294
aVissues like racism, or sexism,
p295
aVor the issue that we've been fighting in this century, homophobia,
p296
aVthose are hard issues.
p297
aVYou don't wake up one day no longer a racist.
p298
aVIt takes generations to tear that intuition, that DNA,
p299
aVout of the soul of a people.
p300
aVBut this is a problem of just incentives, just incentives.
p301
aVChange the incentives, and the behavior changes,
p302
aVand the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems
p303
aVhave seen overnight a change in the practice.
p304
aVWhen Connecticut adopted this system,
p305
aVin the very first year, 78 percent of elected representatives
p306
aVgave up large contributions and took small contributions only.
p307
aVIt's solvable,
p308
aVnot by being a Democrat,
p309
aVnot by being a Republican.
p310
aVIt's solvable by being citizens, by being citizens,
p311
aVby being TEDizens.
p312
aVBecause if you want to kickstart reform,
p313
aVlook, I could kickstart reform
p314
aVat half the price of fixing energy policy,
p315
aVI could give you back a republic.
p316
aa(lp317
VOkay. But even if you're not yet with me,
p318
aVeven if you believe this is impossible,
p319
aVwhat the five years since I spoke at TED has taught me
p320
aVas I've spoken about this issue again and again is,
p321
aVeven if you think it's impossible, that is irrelevant.
p322
aVIrrelevant.
p323
aVI spoke at Dartmouth once, and a woman stood up after I spoke,
p324
aVI write in my book, and she said to me,
p325
aV"Professor, you've convinced me this is hopeless. Hopeless.
p326
aVThere's nothing we can do."
p327
aVWhen she said that, I scrambled.
p328
aVI tried to think, "How do I respond to that hopelessness?
p329
aVWhat is that sense of hopelessness?"
p330
aVAnd what hit me was an image of my six-year-old son.
p331
aVAnd I imagined a doctor coming to me and saying,
p332
aV"Your son has terminal brain cancer, and there's nothing you can do.
p333
aVNothing you can do."
p334
aVSo would I do nothing?
p335
aVWould I just sit there? Accept it? Okay, nothing I can do?
p336
aVI'm going off to build Google Glass.
p337
aVOf course not. I would do everything I could,
p338
aVand I would do everything I could because this is what love means,
p339
aVthat the odds are irrelevant and that you do
p340
aVwhatever the hell you can, the odds be damned.
p341
aVAnd then I saw the obvious link, because even we liberals
p342
aVlove this country.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
VAnd so when the pundits and the politicians
p347
aVsay that change is impossible,
p348
aVwhat this love of country says back is,
p349
aV"That's just irrelevant."
p350
aVWe lose something dear,
p351
aVsomething everyone in this room loves and cherishes,
p352
aVif we lose this republic, and so we act
p353
aVwith everything we can to prove these pundits wrong.
p354
aa(lp355
VSo here's my question:
p356
aVDo you have that love?
p357
aVDo you have that love?
p358
aVBecause if you do,
p359
aVthen what the hell are you, what are the hell are we doing?
p360
aa(lp361
VWhen Ben Franklin was carried from the constitutional convention
p362
aVin September of 1787, he was stopped in the street by a woman who said,
p363
aV"Mr. Franklin, what have you wrought?"
p364
aVFranklin said, "A republic, madam, if you can keep it."
p365
aVA republic. A representative democracy.
p366
aVA government dependent upon the people alone.
p367
aVWe have lost that republic.
p368
aVAll of us have to act to get it back.
p369
