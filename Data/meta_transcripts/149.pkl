VAllison Hunt: My three minutes hasn't started yet, has it?
p4
aa(lp5
VChris Anderson: No, you can't start the three minutes.
p6
aVReset the three minutes, that's just not fair.
p7
aa(lp8
VAH: Oh my God, it's harsh up here.
p9
aVI mean I'm nervous enough as it is.
p10
aa(lp11
VBut I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago.
p12
aVFive weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery.
p13
aVDo you know that surgery?
p14
aVElectric saw, power drill, totally disgusting
p15
aVunless you're David Bolinsky, in which case it's all truth and beauty.
p16
aVSure David, if it's not your hip, it's truth and beauty.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnyway, I did have a really big epiphany around the situation,
p19
aVso Chris invited me to tell you about it.
p20
aVBut first you need to know two things about me.
p21
aVJust two things.
p22
aVI'm Canadian, and I'm the youngest of seven kids.
p23
aVNow, in Canada, we have that great healthcare system.
p24
aVThat means we get our new hips for free.
p25
aVAnd being the youngest of seven,
p26
aVI have never been at the front of the line for anything. OK?
p27
aa(lp28
VSo my hip had been hurting me for years.
p29
aVI finally went to the doctor, which was free.
p30
aVAnd she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon, also free.
p31
aVFinally got to see him after 10 months of waiting \u2014 almost a year.
p32
aVThat is what free gets you.
p33
aVI met the surgeon, and he took some free X-rays,
p34
aVand I got a good look at them. And you know,
p35
aVeven I could tell my hip was bad,
p36
aVand I actually work in marketing.
p37
aVSo he said, "Allison, we've got to get you on the table.
p38
aVI'm going to replace your hip \u2014 it's about an 18-month wait."
p39
aV18 more months.
p40
aVI'd already waited 10 months, and I had to wait 18 more months.
p41
aa(lp42
VYou know, it's such a long wait that I actually
p43
aVstarted to even think about it in terms of TEDs.
p44
aVI wouldn't have my new hip for this TED.
p45
aVI wouldn't have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa.
p46
aVI would not have my new hip for TED2008.
p47
aVI would still be on my bad hip. That was so disappointing.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo, I left his office and I was walking through the hospital,
p50
aVand that's when I had my epiphany.
p51
aVThis youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line.
p52
aVOh yeah.
p53
aa(lp54
VCan I tell you how un-Canadian that is?
p55
aVWe do not think that way.
p56
aVWe don't talk about it. It's not even a consideration.
p57
aVIn fact, when we're traveling abroad, it's how we identify fellow Canadians.
p58
aV"After you." "Oh, no, no. After you."
p59
aVHey, are you from Canada? "Oh, me too! Hi!"
p60
aV"Great! Excellent!"
p61
aa(lp62
VSo no, suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list.
p63
aVSome 70-year-old who wanted his new hip
p64
aVso he could be back golfing, or gardening.
p65
aVNo, no. Front of the line.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo by now I was walking the lobby, and of course, that hurt,
p68
aVbecause of my hip, and I kind of needed a sign.
p69
aVAnd I saw a sign.
p70
aVIn the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop there was a sign
p71
aVthat said, "Volunteers Needed." Hmm.
p72
aVWell, they signed me up immediately.
p73
aVNo reference checks. None of the usual background stuff, no.
p74
aVThey were desperate for volunteers
p75
aVbecause the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75.
p76
aVYeah. They needed some young blood.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo, next thing you know, I had my bright blue volunteer vest,
p79
aVI had my photo ID, and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss.
p80
aVI worked alone.
p81
aVEvery Friday morning I was at the gift shop.
p82
aVWhile ringing in hospital staff's Tic Tacs,
p83
aVI'd casually ask, "What do you do?"
p84
aVThen I'd tell them, "Well, I'm getting my hip replaced \u2014 in 18 months.
p85
aVIt's gonna be so great when the pain stops. Ow!"
p86
aVAll the staff got to know the plucky, young volunteer.
p87
aa(lp88
VMy next surgeon's appointment was, coincidentally,
p89
aVright after a shift at the gift shop.
p90
aVSo, naturally, I had my vest and my identification.
p91
aVI draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office.
p92
aVAnd you know, when he walked in,
p93
aVI could just tell that he saw them.
p94
aVMoments later, I had a surgery date just weeks away,
p95
aVand a big fat prescription for Percocet.
p96
aa(lp97
VNow, word on the street was that it was actually
p98
aVmy volunteering that got me to the front of the line.
p99
aVAnd, you know, I'm not even ashamed of that.
p100
aVTwo reasons.
p101
aVFirst of all, I am going to take such good care of this new hip.
p102
aVBut also I intend to stick with the volunteering,
p103
aVwhich actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all.
p104
aVEven when a Canadian cheats the system,
p105
aVthey do it in a way that benefits society.
