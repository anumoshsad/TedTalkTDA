VAs technology progresses,
p4
aVand as it advances,
p5
aVmany of us assume that these advances
p6
aVmake us more intelligent,
p7
aVmake us smarter and more connected to the world.
p8
aVAnd what I'd like to argue
p9
aVis that that's not necessarily the case,
p10
aVas progress is simply a word for change,
p11
aVand with change you gain something,
p12
aVbut you also lose something.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd to really illustrate this point, what I'd like to do
p15
aVis to show you how technology has dealt with
p16
aVa very simple, a very common, an everyday question.
p17
aVAnd that question is this.
p18
aVWhat time is it? What time is it?
p19
aVIf you glance at your iPhone, it's so simple to tell the time.
p20
aVBut, I'd like to ask you, how would you tell the time
p21
aVif you didn't have an iPhone?
p22
aVHow would you tell the time, say, 600 years ago?
p23
aVHow would you do it?
p24
aa(lp25
VWell, the way you would do it is by using a device
p26
aVthat's called an astrolabe.
p27
aVSo, an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world.
p28
aVBut, at the time, in the 13th century,
p29
aVit was the gadget of the day.
p30
aVIt was the world's first popular computer.
p31
aVAnd it was a device that, in fact, is a model of the sky.
p32
aVSo, the different parts of the astrolabe, in this particular type,
p33
aVthe rete corresponds to the positions of the stars.
p34
aVThe plate corresponds to a coordinate system.
p35
aVAnd the mater has some scales and puts it all together.
p36
aa(lp37
VIf you were an educated child,
p38
aVyou would know how to not only use the astrolabe,
p39
aVyou would also know how to make an astrolabe.
p40
aVAnd we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe,
p41
aVthe first technical manual in the English language,
p42
aVwas written by Geoffrey Chaucer.
p43
aVYes, that Geoffrey Chaucer, in 1391,
p44
aVto his little Lewis, his 11-year-old son.
p45
aVAnd in this book, little Lewis would know the big idea.
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd the central idea that makes this computer work
p48
aVis this thing called stereographic projection.
p49
aVAnd basically, the concept is,
p50
aVhow do you represent the three-dimensional image
p51
aVof the night sky that surrounds us
p52
aVonto a flat, portable, two-dimensional surface.
p53
aVThe idea is actually relatively simple.
p54
aVImagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe,
p55
aVand surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere.
p56
aVEach point on the surface of the sphere
p57
aVis mapped through the bottom pole,
p58
aVonto a flat surface, where it is then recorded.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo the North Star corresponds to the center of the device.
p61
aVThe ecliptic, which is the path of the sun, moon, and planets
p62
aVcorrespond to an offset circle.
p63
aVThe bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete.
p64
aVAnd the altitude corresponds to the plate system.
p65
aVNow, the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection.
p66
aVThe real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems
p67
aVso they fit perfectly.
p68
aVThere is the position of the sun, moon and planets on the movable rete.
p69
aVAnd then there is their location on the sky
p70
aVas seen from a certain latitude on the back plate. Okay?
p71
aa(lp72
VSo how would you use this device?
p73
aVWell, let me first back up for a moment.
p74
aVThis is an astrolabe. Pretty impressive, isn't it?
p75
aVAnd so, this astrolabe is on loan from us
p76
aVfrom the Oxford School of \u2014 Museum of History.
p77
aVAnd you can see the different components.
p78
aVThis is the mater, the scales on the back.
p79
aVThis is the rete. Okay. Do you see that?
p80
aVThat's the movable part of the sky.
p81
aVAnd in the back you can see
p82
aVa spider web pattern.
p83
aVAnd that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky.
p84
aVThis is a rule device. And on the back
p85
aVare some other devices, measuring tools
p86
aVand scales, to be able to make some calculations. Okay?
p87
aa(lp88
VYou know, I've always wanted one of these.
p89
aVFor my thesis I actually built one of these out of paper.
p90
aVAnd this one, this is a replica
p91
aVfrom a 15th-century device.
p92
aVAnd it's worth probably about three MacBook Pros.
p93
aVBut a real one would cost about as much as my house,
p94
aVand the house next to it, and actually every house on the block,
p95
aVon both sides of the street,
p96
aVmaybe a school thrown in, and some \u2014 you know, a church.
p97
aVThey are just incredibly expensive.
p98
aa(lp99
VBut let me show you how to work this device.
p100
aVSo let's go to step one.
p101
aVFirst thing that you do is you select a star
p102
aVin the night sky, if you're telling time at night.
p103
aVSo, tonight, if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle.
p104
aVAnd there is a bright star called Deneb. So let's select Deneb.
p105
aVSecond, is you measure the altitude of Deneb.
p106
aVSo, step two, I hold the device up,
p107
aVand then I sight its altitude there
p108
aVso I can see it clearly now.
p109
aVAnd then I measure its altitude.
p110
aVSo, it's about 26 degrees. You can't see it from over there.
p111
aVStep three is identify the star on the front of the device.
p112
aVDeneb is there. I can tell.
p113
aVStep four is I then move the rete,
p114
aVmove the sky, so the altitude of the star
p115
aVcorresponds to the scale on the back.
p116
aVOkay, so when that happens
p117
aVeverything lines up.
p118
aVI have here a model of the sky
p119
aVthat corresponds to the real sky. Okay?
p120
aVSo, it is, in a sense,
p121
aVholding a model of the universe in my hands.
p122
aVAnd then finally, I take a rule,
p123
aVand move the rule to a date line
p124
aVwhich then tells me the time here.
p125
aVRight. So, that's how the device is used.
p126
aV(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VSo, I know what you're thinking:
p129
aV"That's a lot of work, isn't it? Isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time?"
p130
aVas you glance at your iPod to just check out the time.
p131
aVBut there is a difference between the two, because with your iPod
p132
aVyou can tell \u2014 or your iPhone, you can tell exactly
p133
aVwhat the time is, with precision.
p134
aVThe way little Lewis would tell the time
p135
aVis by a picture of the sky.
p136
aVHe would know where things would fit in the sky.
p137
aVHe would not only know what time it was,
p138
aVhe would also know where the sun would rise,
p139
aVand how it would move across the sky.
p140
aVHe would know what time the sun would rise, and what time it would set.
p141
aVAnd he would know that for essentially every celestial object
p142
aVin the heavens.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo, in computer graphics
p145
aVand computer user interface design,
p146
aVthere is a term called affordances.
p147
aVSo, affordances are the qualities of an object
p148
aVthat allow us to perform an action with it.
p149
aVAnd what the astrolabe does is it allows us,
p150
aVit affords us, to connect to the night sky,
p151
aVto look up into the night sky and be much more \u2014
p152
aVto see the visible and the invisible together.
p153
aVSo, that's just one use. Incredible,
p154
aVthere is probably 350, 400 uses.
p155
aVIn fact, there is a text, and that has over a thousand uses
p156
aVof this first computer.
p157
aa(lp158
VOn the back there is scales and measurements
p159
aVfor terrestrial navigation.
p160
aVYou can survey with it. The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it.
p161
aVIt can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types.
p162
aVAnd it would take a full university course to illustrate it.
p163
aVAstrolabes have an incredible history.
p164
aVThey are over 2,000 years old.
p165
aVThe concept of stereographic projection
p166
aVoriginated in 330 B.C.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd the astrolabes come in many different
p169
aVsizes and shapes and forms.
p170
aVThere is portable ones. There is large display ones.
p171
aVAnd I think what is common to all astrolabes
p172
aVis that they are beautiful works of art.
p173
aVThere is a quality of craftsmanship and precision
p174
aVthat is just astonishing and remarkable.
p175
aa(lp176
VAstrolabes, like every technology, do evolve over time.
p177
aVSo, the earliest retes, for example, were very simple and primitive.
p178
aVAnd advancing retes became cultural emblems.
p179
aVThis is one from Oxford.
p180
aVAnd I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern
p181
aVis completely symmetrical,
p182
aVand it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical, or random sky.
p183
aVHow cool is that? This is just amazing.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo, would little Lewis have an astrolabe?
p186
aVProbably not one made of brass. He would have one made out of wood,
p187
aVor paper. And the vast majority of this first computer
p188
aVwas a portable device
p189
aVthat you could keep in the back of your pocket.
p190
aVSo, what does the astrolabe inspire?
p191
aVWell, I think the first thing is that
p192
aVit reminds us just how resourceful people were,
p193
aVour forebears were, years and years ago.
p194
aVIt's just an incredible device.
p195
aa(lp196
VEvery technology advances.
p197
aVEvery technology is transformed and moved by others.
p198
aVAnd what we gain with a new technology, of course,
p199
aVis precision and accuracy.
p200
aVBut what we lose, I think, is
p201
aVan accurate \u2014 a felt sense
p202
aVof the sky, a sense of context.
p203
aVKnowing the sky, knowing your relationship with the sky,
p204
aVis the center of the real answer
p205
aVto knowing what time it is.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo, it's \u2014 I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices.
p208
aVAnd so, what can you learn from these devices?
p209
aVWell, primarily that there is a subtle knowledge
p210
aVthat we can connect with the world.
p211
aVAnd astrolabes return us to this subtle sense
p212
aVof how things all fit together,
p213
aVand also how we connect to the world.
p214
aVThanks very much.
