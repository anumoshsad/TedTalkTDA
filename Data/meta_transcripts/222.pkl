aa(lp5
V\u266b I first saw you and I got so shy. \u266b
p6
aa(lp7
V\u266b You see, I was a little paranoid 'cause I might have been high. \u266b
p8
aa(lp9
V\u266b And I hadn't done that in ages and I won't do that again. \u266b
p10
aa(lp11
V\u266b But that's another story. \u266b
p12
aa(lp13
V\u266b Loved you forever and I've been a big fan, \u266b
p14
aa(lp15
V\u266b the one-woman shows, I even rented "Pat." \u266b
p16
aa(lp17
V\u266b I got enough nerve to come up to you, \u266b
p18
aa(lp19
V\u266b but little did I know one year later we'd be doing this show. \u266b
p20
aa(lp21

V\u266b I first saw you and I wasn't so shy. \u266b
p30
aa(lp31
VI made a beeline for you and told you what a huge fan I was
p32
aVever since I was writing that pilot for Fox, and Wendy
p33
aVand I wanted you to do the theme song.
p34
aVAnd then the pilot didn't go and I was so sad,
p35
aVbut I kept remaining a fan of yours.
p36
aVAnd then when I went through that big, horrible breakup with Carl
p37
aVand I couldn't get off the couch, I listened to your song,
p38
aV\u266b "Now That I Don't Have You," \u266b over and over and over and over again.
p39
aVAnd I can't believe you're here and that I'm meeting you here at TED.
p40
aVAnd also, I can't believe that we're eating sushi
p41
aVin front of the fish tank,
p42
aVwhich, personally, I think is really inappropriate.
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aV(Applause)

aa(lp62
V\u266b William Faulkner, drunk and depressed. \u266b Sweeney: Mmm.
p63
aa(lp64
V\u266b Dorothy Parker, mean, drunk and depressed. \u266b Sweeney: I know.
p65
aa(lp66
V\u266b And that guy, "Seven Years in Tibet," turned out to be a Nazi. \u266b Sweeney: Yeah.
p67
aa(lp68
V\u266b Founding fathers all had slaves. \u266b Sweeney: I know.

p73
aa(lp74
VSweeney: Don't get me started on that. (Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
V\u266b Sobule: Paul McCartney, jealous of John, even more so now that he's gone. \u266b
p77
aa(lp78
V\u266b Dylan was so mean to Donovan in that movie. \u266b
p79
aa(lp80
V\u266b Pablo Picasso, cruel to his wives. \u266b Sweeney: Horrible.
p81

p87
aa(lp88
V\u266b Together: Why are all our heroes so imperfect? Yeah \u266b

p95
aa(lp96
V\u266b Plato in the cave with those very young boys. \u266b Sweeney: Ooh...
p97
aa(lp98
V\u266b Sobule: Hillary supported the war. \u266b
p99

p101

aa(lp110
VSweeney: Okay. Oprah was never necessarily a big hero of mine.
p111
aVI mean, I watch Oprah mostly when I'm home in Spokane
p112
aVvisiting my mother. And to my mother,
p113
aVOprah is a greater moral authority than the Pope,
p114
aVwhich is actually saying something because she's a devout Catholic.
p115
aVAnyway, I like Oprah \u2014 I like her girlfriendy-ness,
p116
aVI like her weight issues,
p117
aVI like how she's transformed talk television,
p118
aVI like how she's brought reading back to America \u2014
p119
aVbut there was something that happened the last two weeks
p120
aVthat was ... I call it the Soon-Yi moment:
p121
aVit is the moment when I cannot continue supporting someone.
p122
aVAnd that was that she did two entire shows
p123
aVpromoting that movie "The Secret."
p124
aVDo you guys know about that movie "The Secret"?
p125
aVIt makes "What the Bleep Do We Know" seem like a doctoral dissertation
p126
aVfrom Harvard on quantum mechanics \u2014 that's how bad it is.
p127
aVIt makes "The DaVinci Code" seem like "War and Peace."
p128
aVThat movie is so horrible. It promotes such awful pseudoscience.
p129
aVAnd the basic idea is
p130
aVthat there's this law of attraction, and
p131
aVyour thoughts have this vibrating energy
p132
aVthat goes out into the universe
p133
aVand then you attract good things to happen to you.
p134
aVOn a scientific basis, it's more than just "Power of Positive Thinking" \u2014
p135
aVit has a horrible, horrible dark side. Like if you get ill,
p136
aVit's because you've just been thinking negative thoughts.
p137
aVYeah, stuff like that was in the movie and she's promoting it.
p138
aVAnd all I'm saying is that I really wish that Murray Gell-Mann
p139
aVwould go on Oprah
p140
aVand just explain to her that the law of attraction is, in fact, not a law.
p141
aVSo that's what I have to say.
