VToday I'm going to show you an electric vehicle
p4
aVthat weighs less than a bicycle,
p5
aVthat you can carry with you anywhere,
p6
aVthat you can charge off a normal wall outlet in 15 minutes,
p7
aVand you can run it for 1,000 kilometers
p8
aVon about a dollar of electricity.
p9
aVBut when I say the word electric vehicle,
p10
aVpeople think about vehicles. They think about cars
p11
aVand motorcycles and bicycles, and the vehicles that you use every day.
p12
aVBut if you come about it from a different perspective,
p13
aVyou can create some more interesting,
p14
aVmore novel concepts.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo we built something.
p17
aVI've got some of the pieces in my pocket here.
p18
aVSo this is the motor.
p19
aVThis motor has enough power to take you
p20
aVup the hills of San Francisco at about 20 miles per hour,
p21
aVabout 30 kilometers an hour,
p22
aVand this battery, this battery right here
p23
aVhas about six miles of range, or 10 kilometers,
p24
aVwhich is enough to cover about half of the car trips
p25
aVin the U.S. alone.
p26
aVBut the best part about these components
p27
aVis that we bought them at a toy store.
p28
aVThese are from remote control airplanes.
p29
aVAnd the performance of these things has gotten so good
p30
aVthat if you think about vehicles a little bit differently,
p31
aVyou can really change things.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo today we're going to show you one example
p34
aVof how you can use this.
p35
aVPay attention to not only how fun this thing is,
p36
aVbut also how the portability that comes with this
p37
aVcan totally change the way you interact with a city like San Francisco.

p45
aV(Cheers)
p46
aa(lp47
VSo we're going to show you what this thing can do.
p48
aVIt's really maneuverable. You have a hand-held remote,
p49
aVso you can pretty easily control acceleration, braking,
p50
aVgo in reverse if you like, also have braking.
p51
aVIt's incredible just how light this thing is.
p52
aVI mean, this is something you can pick up and carry with you
p53
aVanywhere you go.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo I'll leave you with one of the most compelling facts
p56
aVabout this technology and these kinds of vehicles.
p57
aVThis uses 20 times less energy
p58
aVfor every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car,
p59
aVwhich means not only is this thing fast to charge
p60
aVand really cheap to build,
p61
aVbut it also reduces the footprint of your energy use
p62
aVin terms of your transportation.
p63
aVSo instead of looking at large amounts of energy needed
p64
aVfor each person in this room to get around in a city,
p65
aVnow you can look at much smaller amounts
p66
aVand more sustainable transportation.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo next time you think about a vehicle,
p69
aVI hope, like us, you're thinking about something new.
p70
aa(lp71
VThank you.
