VSo over the past few centuries, microscopes have revolutionized our world.
p4
aVThey revealed to us a tiny world of objects, life and structures
p5
aVthat are too small for us to see with our naked eyes.
p6
aVThey are a tremendous contribution to science and technology.
p7
aVToday I'd like to introduce you to a new type of microscope,
p8
aVa microscope for changes.
p9
aVIt doesn't use optics like a regular microscope
p10
aVto make small objects bigger,
p11
aVbut instead it uses a video camera and image processing
p12
aVto reveal to us the tiniest motions and color changes in objects and people,
p13
aVchanges that are impossible for us to see with our naked eyes.
p14
aVAnd it lets us look at our world in a completely new way.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo what do I mean by color changes?
p17
aVOur skin, for example, changes its color very slightly
p18
aVwhen the blood flows under it.
p19
aVThat change is incredibly subtle,
p20
aVwhich is why, when you look at other people,
p21
aVwhen you look at the person sitting next to you,
p22
aVyou don't see their skin or their face changing color.
p23
aVWhen we look at this video of Steve here, it appears to us like a static picture,
p24
aVbut once we look at this video through our new, special microscope,
p25
aVsuddenly we see a completely different image.
p26
aVWhat you see here are small changes in the color of Steve's skin,
p27
aVmagnified 100 times so that they become visible.
p28
aVWe can actually see a human pulse.
p29
aVWe can see how fast Steve's heart is beating,
p30
aVbut we can also see the actual way that the blood flows in his face.
p31
aVAnd we can do that not just to visualize the pulse,
p32
aVbut also to actually  recover our heart rates,
p33
aVand measure our heart rates.
p34
aVAnd we can do it with regular cameras and without touching the patients.
p35
aVSo here you see the pulse and heart rate we extracted from a neonatal baby
p36
aVfrom a video we took with a regular DSLR camera,
p37
aVand the heart rate measurement we get
p38
aVis as accurate as the one you'd get with a standard monitor in a hospital.
p39
aVAnd it doesn't even have to be a video we recorded.
p40
aVWe can do it essentially with other videos as well.
p41
aVSo I just took a short clip from "Batman Begins" here
p42
aVjust to show Christian Bale's pulse.
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aVAnd you know, presumably he's wearing makeup,
p45
aVthe lighting here is kind of challenging,
p46
aVbut still, just from the video, we're able to extract his pulse
p47
aVand show it quite well.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo how do we do all that?
p50
aVWe basically analyze the changes in the light that are recorded
p51
aVat every pixel in the video over time,
p52
aVand then we crank up those changes.
p53
aVWe make them bigger so that we can see them.
p54
aVThe tricky part is that those signals,
p55
aVthose changes that we're after, are extremely subtle,
p56
aVso we have to be very careful when you try to separate them
p57
aVfrom noise that always exists in videos.
p58
aVSo we use some clever image processing techniques
p59
aVto get a very accurate measurement of the color at each pixel in the video,
p60
aVand then the way the color changes over time,
p61
aVand then we amplify those changes.
p62
aVWe make them bigger to create those types of enhanced videos, or magnified videos,
p63
aVthat actually show us those changes.
p64
aa(lp65
VBut it turns out we can do that not just to show tiny changes in color,
p66
aVbut also tiny motions,
p67
aVand that's because the light that gets recorded in our cameras
p68
aVwill change not only if the color of the object changes,
p69
aVbut also if the object moves.
p70
aVSo this is my daughter when she was about two months old.
p71
aVIt's a video I recorded about three years ago.
p72
aVAnd as new parents, we all want to make sure our babies are healthy,
p73
aVthat they're breathing, that they're alive, of course.
p74
aVSo I too got one of those baby monitors
p75
aVso that I could see my daughter when she was asleep.
p76
aVAnd this is pretty much what you'll see with a standard baby monitor.
p77
aVYou can see the baby's sleeping, but  there's not too much information there.
p78
aVThere's not too much we can see.
p79
aVWouldn't it be better, or more informative, or more useful,
p80
aVif instead we could look at the view like this.
p81
aVSo here I took the motions and I magnified them 30 times,
p82
aVand then I could clearly see that my daughter was indeed alive and breathing.
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVHere is a side-by-side comparison.
p85
aVSo again, in the source video, in the original video,
p86
aVthere's not too much we can see,
p87
aVbut once we magnify the motions, the breathing becomes much more visible.
p88
aVAnd it turns out, there's a lot of phenomena
p89
aVwe can reveal and magnify with our new motion microscope.
p90
aVWe can see how our veins and arteries are pulsing in our bodies.
p91
aVWe can see that our eyes are constantly moving
p92
aVin this wobbly motion.
p93
aVAnd that's actually my eye,
p94
aVand again this video was taken right after my daughter was born,
p95
aVso you can see I wasn't getting too much sleep. (Laughter)
p96
aVEven when a person is sitting still,
p97
aVthere's a lot of information we can extract
p98
aVabout their breathing patterns, small facial expressions.
p99
aVMaybe we could use those motions
p100
aVto tell us something about our thoughts or our emotions.
p101
aVWe can also magnify small mechanical movements,
p102
aVlike vibrations in engines,
p103
aVthat can help engineers detect and diagnose machinery problems,
p104
aVor see how our buildings and structures sway in the wind and react to forces.
p105
aVThose are all things that our society knows how to measure in various ways,
p106
aVbut measuring those motions is one thing,
p107
aVand actually seeing those motions as they happen
p108
aVis a whole different thing.
p109
aa(lp110
VAnd ever since we discovered this new technology,
p111
aVwe made our code available online so that  others could use and experiment with it.
p112
aVIt's very simple to use.
p113
aVIt can work on your own videos.
p114
aVOur collaborators at Quanta Research even created this nice website
p115
aVwhere you can upload your videos and process them online,
p116
aVso even if you don't have any experience in computer science or programming,
p117
aVyou can still very easily experiment with this new microscope.
p118
aVAnd I'd like to show you just a couple of examples
p119
aVof what others have done with it.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo this video was made by a YouTube user called Tamez85.
p122
aVI don't know who that user is,
p123
aVbut he, or she, used our code
p124
aVto magnify small belly movements during pregnancy.
p125
aVIt's kind of creepy.
p126
aV(Laughter)
p127
aVPeople have used it to magnify pulsing veins in their hands.
p128
aVAnd you know it's not real science unless you use guinea pigs,
p129
aVand apparently this guinea pig is called Tiffany,
p130
aVand this YouTube user claims it is the first rodent on Earth
p131
aVthat was motion-magnified.
p132
aa(lp133
VYou can also do some art with it.
p134
aVSo this video was sent to me by a design student at Yale.
p135
aVShe wanted to see if there's any difference
p136
aVin the way her classmates move.
p137
aVShe made them all stand still, and then magnified their motions.
p138
aVIt's like seeing  still pictures come to life.
p139
aVAnd the nice thing with  all those examples
p140
aVis that we had nothing to do with them.
p141
aVWe just provided this new tool, a new way to look at the world,
p142
aVand then people find other interesting, new and creative ways of using it.
p143
aa(lp144
VBut we didn't stop there.
p145
aVThis tool not only allows us to look at the world in a new way,
p146
aVit also redefines what we can do
p147
aVand pushes the limits of what we can do with our cameras.
p148
aVSo as scientists, we started wondering,
p149
aVwhat other types of physical phenomena produce tiny motions
p150
aVthat we could now use our cameras to measure?
p151
aVAnd one such phenomenon that we focused on recently is sound.
p152
aVSound, as we all know, is basically changes
p153
aVin air pressure that travel through the air.
p154
aVThose pressure waves hit objects and they create small vibrations in them,
p155
aVwhich is how we hear and how we record sound.
p156
aVBut it turns out that sound also produces visual motions.
p157
aVThose are motions that are not visible to us
p158
aVbut are visible to a camera with the right processing.
p159
aVSo here are two examples.
p160
aVThis is me demonstrating my great singing skills.
p161
aV(Singing)
p162
aV(Laughter)
p163
aVAnd I took a high-speed video of my throat while I was humming.
p164
aVAgain, if you stare at that video,
p165
aVthere's not too much you'll be able to see,
p166
aVbut once we magnify the motions 100 times, we can see all the motions and ripples
p167
aVin the neck that are involved in producing the sound.
p168
aVThat signal is there in that video.
p169
aa(lp170
VWe also know that singers can break a wine glass
p171
aVif they hit the correct note.
p172
aVSo here, we're going to play a note
p173
aVthat's in the resonance frequency of that glass
p174
aVthrough a loudspeaker that's next to it.
p175
aVOnce we play that note and magnify the motions 250 times,
p176
aVwe can very clearly see  how the glass vibrates
p177
aVand resonates in response to the sound.
p178
aVIt's not something you're used to seeing every day.
p179
aVBut this made us think. It gave us this crazy idea.
p180
aVCan we actually invert this process and recover sound from video
p181
aVby analyzing the tiny vibrations that sound waves create in objects,
p182
aVand essentially convert those back into the sounds that produced them.
p183
aVIn this way, we can turn everyday objects into microphones.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo that's exactly what we did.
p186
aVSo here's an empty bag of chips that was lying on a table,
p187
aVand we're going to turn that  bag of chips into a microphone
p188
aVby filming it with a video camera
p189
aVand analyzing the tiny motions that sound waves create in it.
p190
aVSo here's the sound that we played in the room.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd this is a high-speed video we recorded of that bag of chips.
p195
aVAgain it's playing.
p196
aVThere's no chance you'll be able to see anything going on in that video
p197
aVjust by looking at it,
p198
aVbut here's the sound we were able to recover just by analyzing
p199
aVthe tiny motions in that video.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")
p202
aa(lp203
VI call it \u2014 Thank you.
p204
aV(Applause)
p205
aVI call it the visual microphone.
p206
aVWe actually extract audio signals from video signals.
p207
aVAnd just to give you a sense of the scale of the motions here,
p208
aVa pretty loud sound will cause that bag of chips to move less than a micrometer.
p209
aVThat's one thousandth of a millimeter.
p210
aVThat's how tiny the motions are that we are now able to pull out
p211
aVjust by observing how light bounces off objects
p212
aVand gets recorded by our cameras.
p213
aa(lp214
VWe can recover sounds from other objects, like plants.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")
p217
aa(lp218
VAnd we can recover speech as well.
p219
aVSo here's a person speaking in a room.
p220
aa(lp221
VVoice: Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,
p222
aVand everywhere that Mary went, that lamb was sure to go.
p223
aa(lp224
VMichael Rubinstein: And here's that speech again recovered
p225
aVjust from this video of that same bag of chips.
p226
aa(lp227
VVoice: Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,
p228
aVand everywhere that Mary went, that lamb was sure to go.
p229
aa(lp230
VMR: We used "Mary Had a Little Lamb"
p231
aVbecause those are said to be the first words
p232
aVthat Thomas Edison spoke  into his phonograph in 1877.
p233
aVIt was one of the first sound recording devices in history.
p234
aVIt basically directed the sounds onto a diaphragm
p235
aVthat vibrated a needle that essentially engraved the sound on tinfoil
p236
aVthat was wrapped around the cylinder.
p237
aa(lp238
VHere's a demonstration of recording and  replaying sound with Edison's phonograph.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Video) Voice: Testing, testing, one two three.
p241
aVMary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,
p242
aVand everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.
p243
aVTesting, testing, one two three.
p244
aVMary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,
p245
aVand everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.
p246
aa(lp247
VMR: And now, 137 years later,
p248
aVwe're able to get sound in pretty much similar quality
p249
aVbut by just watching objects vibrate to sound with cameras,
p250
aVand we can even do that when the camera
p251
aVis 15 feet away from the object, behind soundproof glass.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo this is the sound that we were  able to recover in that case.
p254
aa(lp255
VVoice: Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,
p256
aVand everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.
p257
aa(lp258
VMR: And of course, surveillance is the first application that comes to mind.
p259
aV(Laughter)
p260
aVBut it might actually be useful for other things as well.
p261
aVMaybe in the future, we'll be able to use it, for example,
p262
aVto recover sound across space,
p263
aVbecause sound can't travel in space, but light can.
p264
aa(lp265
VWe've only just begun exploring
p266
aVother possible uses for this new technology.
p267
aVIt lets us see physical processes that we know are there
p268
aVbut that we've never been able to see with our own eyes until now.
p269
aa(lp270
VThis is our team.
p271
aVEverything I showed you today is a result of a collaboration
p272
aVwith this great group of people you see here,
p273
aVand I encourage you and welcome you to check out our website,
p274
aVtry it out yourself,
p275
aVand join us in exploring this world of tiny motions.
p276
aa(lp277
