VI want to tell you three stories
p4
aVabout the power of relationships
p5
aVto solve the deep and complex social problems of this century.
p6
aa(lp7
VYou know, sometimes it seems like all these problems
p8
aVof poverty, inequality, ill health, unemployment, violence, addiction \u2014
p9
aVthey're right there in one person's life.
p10
aVSo I want to tell you about someone like this that I know.
p11
aVI'm going to call her Ella.
p12
aVElla lives in a British city on a run down estate.
p13
aVThe shops are closed, the pub's gone,
p14
aVthe playground's pretty desolate and never used,
p15
aVand inside Ella's house, the tension is palpable
p16
aVand the noise levels are deafening.
p17
aVThe TV's on at full volume.
p18
aVOne of her sons is fighting with one of her daughters.
p19
aVAnother son, Ryan, is keeping up this constant stream of abuse from the kitchen,
p20
aVand the dogs are locked behind the bedroom door and straining.
p21
aVElla is stuck.
p22
aVShe has lived with crisis for 40 years.
p23
aVShe knows nothing else, and she knows no way out.
p24
aVShe's had a whole series of abusive partners,
p25
aVand, tragically, one of her children has been taken into care by social services.
p26
aVThe three children that still live with her
p27
aVsuffer from a whole range of problems, and none of them are in education.
p28
aVAnd Ella says to me that she is repeating the cycle
p29
aVof her own mother's life before her.
p30
aa(lp31
VBut when I met Ella, there were 73 different services
p32
aVon offer for her and her family in the city where she lives,
p33
aV73 different services run out of 24 departments in one city,
p34
aVand Ella and her partners and her children were known to most of them.
p35
aVThey think nothing of calling social services
p36
aVto try and mediate one of the many arguments that broke out.
p37
aVAnd the family home was visited on a regular basis by social workers,
p38
aVyouth workers, a health officer, a housing officer, a home tutor
p39
aVand the local policemen.
p40
aVAnd the governments say that there are 100,000 families
p41
aVin Britain today like Ella's,
p42
aVstruggling to break the cycle of economic, social and environmental deprivation.
p43
aVAnd they also say that managing this problem
p44
aVcosts a quarter of a million pounds per family per year
p45
aVand yet nothing changes.
p46
aVNone of these well-meaning visitors are making a difference.
p47
aa(lp48
VThis is a chart we made in the same city with another family like Ella's.
p49
aVThis shows 30 years of intervention in that family's life.
p50
aVAnd just as with Ella, not one of these interventions is part of an overall plan.
p51
aVThere's no end goal in sight.
p52
aVNone of the interventions are dealing with the underlying issues.
p53
aVThese are just containment measures, ways of managing a problem.
p54
aVOne of the policemen says to me,
p55
aV"Look, I just deliver the message and then I leave."
p56
aa(lp57
VSo, I've spent time living with families like Ella's
p58
aVin different parts of the world,
p59
aVbecause I want to know: what can we learn
p60
aVfrom places where our social institutions just aren't working?
p61
aVI want to know what it feels like to live in Ella's family.
p62
aVI want to know what's going on and what we can do differently.
p63
aa(lp64
VWell, the first thing I learned is that cost is a really slippery concept.
p65
aVBecause when the government says that a family like Ella's
p66
aVcosts a quarter of a million pounds a year to manage,
p67
aVwhat it really means
p68
aVis that this system costs a quarter of a million pounds a year.
p69
aVBecause not one penny of this money actually touches Ella's family
p70
aVin a way that makes a difference.
p71
aVInstead, the system is just like this costly gyroscope
p72
aVthat spins around the families, keeping them stuck at its heart,
p73
aVexactly where they are.
p74
aa(lp75
VAnd I also spent time with the frontline workers,
p76
aVand I learned that it is an impossible situation.
p77
aVSo Tom, who is the social worker for Ella's 14-year-old son Ryan,
p78
aVhas to spend 86 percent of his time servicing the system:
p79
aVmeetings with colleagues, filling out forms,
p80
aVmore meetings with colleagues to discuss the forms,
p81
aVand maybe most shockingly,
p82
aVthe 14 percent of the time he has to be with Ryan
p83
aVis spent getting data and information for the system.
p84
aVSo he says to Ryan,
p85
aV"How often have you been smoking? Have you been drinking?
p86
aVWhen did you go to school?"
p87
aVAnd this kind of interaction rules out the possibility
p88
aVof a normal conversation.
p89
aVIt rules out the possibility of what's needed
p90
aVto build a relationship between Tom and Ryan.
p91
aa(lp92
VWhen we made this chart,
p93
aVthe frontline workers, the professionals \u2014
p94
aVthey stared at it absolutely amazed.
p95
aVIt snaked around the walls of their offices.
p96
aVSo many hours, so well meant, but ultimately so futile.
p97
aVAnd there was this moment of absolute breakdown,
p98
aVand then of clarity:
p99
aVwe had to work in a different way.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo in a really brave step, the leaders of the city where Ella lives
p102
aVagreed that we could start by reversing Ryan's ratio.
p103
aVSo everyone who came into contact with Ella or a family like Ella's
p104
aVwould spend 80 percent of their time working with the families
p105
aVand only 20 percent servicing the system.
p106
aVAnd even more radically,
p107
aVthe families would lead
p108
aVand they would decide who was in a best position to help them.
p109
aVSo Ella and another mother were asked to be part of an interview panel,
p110
aVto choose from amongst the existing professionals
p111
aVwho would work with them.
p112
aVAnd many, many people wanted to join us,
p113
aVbecause you don't go into this kind of work to manage a system,
p114
aVyou go in because you can and you want to make a difference.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo Ella and the mother asked everybody who came through the door,
p117
aV"What will you do when my son starts kicking me?"
p118
aVAnd so the first person who comes in says,
p119
aV"Well, I'll look around for the nearest exit
p120
aVand I will back out very slowly,
p121
aVand if the noise is still going on, I'll call my supervisor."
p122
aVAnd the mothers go, "You're the system. Get out of here!"
p123
aVAnd then the next person who comes is a policeman, and he says,
p124
aV"Well, I'll tackle your son to the ground and then I'm not sure what I'll do."
p125
aVAnd the mothers say, "Thank you."
p126
aVSo, they chose professionals who confessed
p127
aVthey didn't necessarily have the answers,
p128
aVwho said \u2014 well, they weren't going to talk in jargon.
p129
aVThey showed their human qualities and convinced the mothers
p130
aVthat they would stick with them through thick and thin,
p131
aVeven though they wouldn't be soft with them.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo these new teams and the families
p134
aVwere then given a sliver of the former budget,
p135
aVbut they could spend the money in any way they chose.
p136
aVAnd so one of the families went out for supper.
p137
aVThey went to McDonald's and they sat down and they talked and they listened
p138
aVfor the first time in a long time.
p139
aVAnother family asked the team
p140
aVif they would help them do up their home.
p141
aVAnd one mother took the money
p142
aVand she used it as a float to start a social enterprise.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd in a really short space of time,
p145
aVsomething new started to grow:
p146
aVa relationship between the team and the workers.
p147
aVAnd then some remarkable changes took place.
p148
aVMaybe it's not surprising
p149
aVthat the journey for Ella has had some big steps backwards
p150
aVas well as forwards.
p151
aVBut today, she's completed an IT training course,
p152
aVshe has her first paid job, her children are back in school,
p153
aVand the neighbors,
p154
aVwho previously just hoped this family would be moved anywhere
p155
aVexcept next door to them,
p156
aVare fine.
p157
aVThey've made some new friendships.
p158
aVAnd all the same people have been involved in this transformation \u2014
p159
aVsame families, same workers.
p160
aVBut the relationship between them has been supported to change.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo I'm telling you about Ella because I think that relationships
p163
aVare the critical resource we have
p164
aVin solving some of these intractable problems.
p165
aVBut today, our relationships are all but written off
p166
aVby our politics, our social policies, our welfare institutions.
p167
aVAnd I've learned that this really has to change.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo what do I mean by relationships?
p170
aVI'm talking about the simple human bonds between us,
p171
aVa kind of authentic sense of connection, of belonging,
p172
aVthe bonds that make us happy, that support us to change,
p173
aVto be brave like Ella and try something new.
p174
aVAnd, you know, it's no accident
p175
aVthat those who run and work in the institutions
p176
aVthat are supposed to support Ella and her family
p177
aVdon't talk about relationships,
p178
aVbecause relationships are expressly designed out of a welfare model
p179
aVthat was drawn up in Britain and exported around the world.
p180
aVThe contemporaries of William Beveridge,
p181
aVwho was the architect of the first welfare state
p182
aVand the author of the Beveridge Report,
p183
aVhad little faith in what they called the average sensual or emotional man.
p184
aVInstead, they trusted this idea of the impersonal system
p185
aVand the bureaucrat who would be detached and work in this system.
p186
aVAnd the impact of Beveridge
p187
aVon the way the modern state sees social issues
p188
aVjust can't be underestimated.
p189
aVThe Beveridge Report sold over 100,000 copies
p190
aVin the first weeks of publication alone.
p191
aVPeople queued in the rain on a November night to get hold of a copy,
p192
aVand it was read across the country, across the colonies, across Europe,
p193
aVacross the United States of America,
p194
aVand it had this huge impact
p195
aVon the way that welfare states were designed around the globe.
p196
aVThe cultures, the bureaucracies, the institutions \u2014 they are global,
p197
aVand they've come to seem like common sense.
p198
aVThey've become so ingrained in us,
p199
aVthat actually we don't even see them anymore.
p200
aVAnd I think it's really important to say that in the 20th century,
p201
aVthey were remarkably successful, these institutions.
p202
aVThey led to longer lifespans, the eradication of mass disease,
p203
aVmass housing, almost universal education.
p204
aVBut at the same time,
p205
aVBeveridge sowed the seeds of today's challenges.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo let me tell you a second story.
p208
aVWhat do you think today is a bigger killer than a lifetime of smoking?
p209
aVIt's loneliness.
p210
aVAccording to government statistics, one person over 60 \u2014 one in three \u2014
p211
aVdoesn't speak to or see another person in a week.
p212
aVOne person in 10, that's 850,000 people,
p213
aVdoesn't speak to anyone else in a month.
p214
aVAnd we're not the only people with this problem;
p215
aVthis problem touches the whole of the Western world.
p216
aVAnd it's even more acute in countries like China,
p217
aVwhere a process of rapid urbanization, mass migration, has left older people
p218
aValone in the villages.
p219
aVAnd so the services that Beveridge designed and exported \u2014
p220
aVthey can't address this kind of problem.
p221
aVLoneliness is like a collective relational challenge,
p222
aVand it can't be addressed by a traditional bureaucratic response.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo some years ago, wanting to understand this problem,
p225
aVI started to work with a group of about 60 older people
p226
aVin South London, where I live.
p227
aVI went shopping, I played bingo,
p228
aVbut mainly I was just observing and listening.
p229
aVI wanted to know what we could do differently.
p230
aVAnd if you ask them, people tell you they want two things.
p231
aVThey want somebody to go up a ladder and change a light bulb,
p232
aVor to be there when they come out of hospital.
p233
aVThey want on-demand, practical support.
p234
aVAnd they want to have fun.
p235
aVThey want to go out, do interesting things with like-minded people,
p236
aVand make friends like we've all made friends at every stage of our lives.
p237
aVSo we rented a phone line, hired a couple of handymen,
p238
aVand started a service we called "Circle."
p239
aVAnd Circle offers its local membership a toll-free 0 800 number
p240
aVthat they can call on demand for any support.
p241
aVAnd people have called us for so many reasons.
p242
aVThey've called because their pets are unwell,
p243
aVtheir DVD is broken, they've forgotten how to use their mobile phone,
p244
aVor maybe they are coming out of hospital
p245
aVand they want someone to be there.
p246
aVAnd Circle also offers a rich social calendar \u2014
p247
aVknitting, darts, museum tours, hot air ballooning \u2014 you name it.
p248
aVBut here's the interesting thing, the really deep change:
p249
aVover time, the friendships that have formed
p250
aVhave begun to replace the practical offer.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo let me tell you about Belinda.
p253
aVBelinda's a Circle member, and she was going into hospital for a hip operation,
p254
aVso she called her local Circle to say they wouldn't see her for a bit.
p255
aVAnd Damon, who runs the local Circle, calls her back and says, "How can I help?"
p256
aVAnd Belinda says, "Oh no, I'm fine \u2014
p257
aVJocelyn is doing the shopping, Tony's doing the gardening,
p258
aVMelissa and Joe are going to come in and cook and chat."
p259
aVSo five Circle members had organized themselves
p260
aVto take care of Belinda.
p261
aVAnd Belinda's 80, although she says that she feels 25 inside,
p262
aVbut she also says
p263
aVthat she felt stuck and pretty down when she joined Circle.
p264
aVBut the simple act of encouraging her to come along to that first event
p265
aVled to a process where natural friendships formed,
p266
aVfriendships that today are replacing the need for expensive services.
p267
aVIt's relationships that are making the difference.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo I think that three factors have converged
p270
aVthat enable us to put relationships at the heart and center
p271
aVof how we solve social problems today.
p272
aVFirstly, the nature of the problems \u2014
p273
aVthey've changed, and they require different solutions.
p274
aVSecondly, the cost, human as much as financial, of doing business as usual.
p275
aVAnd thirdly, technology.
p276
aa(lp277
VI've talked about the first two factors.
p278
aVIt's technology that enables these approaches to scale
p279
aVand potentially now support thousands of people.
p280
aVSo the technology we've used is really simple,
p281
aVit's made up of available things like databases, mobile phones.
p282
aVCircle has got this very simple system that underpins it,
p283
aVenables a small local team to support a membership of up to a thousand.
p284
aVAnd you can contrast this with a neighborhood organization
p285
aVof the 1970s,
p286
aVwhen this kind of scale just wasn't possible,
p287
aVneither was the quality or the longevity that the spine of technology can provide.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo it's relationships underpinned by technology
p290
aVthat can turn the Beveridge models on their heads.
p291
aVThe Beveridge models are all about institutions with finite resources,
p292
aVanonymously managing access.
p293
aVIn my work at the front line,
p294
aVI've seen again and again how up to 80 percent of resource
p295
aVis spent keeping people out.
p296
aVSo professionals have to administer
p297
aVthese increasingly complex forms of administration
p298
aVthat are basically about stopping people accessing the service
p299
aVor managing the queue.
p300
aVAnd Circle, like the relational services that we and others have designed,
p301
aVinverts this logic.
p302
aVWhat it says is, the more people, the more relationships,
p303
aVthe stronger the solution.
p304
aVSo I want to tell you my third and final story,
p305
aVwhich is about unemployment.
p306
aVIn Britain, as in most places in the world,
p307
aVour welfare states were primarily designed
p308
aVto get people into work,
p309
aVto educate them for this,
p310
aVand to keep them healthy.
p311
aVBut here, too, the systems are failing.
p312
aVAnd so the response has been
p313
aVto try and make these old systems even more efficient and transactional \u2014
p314
aVto speed up processing times, divide people into ever-smaller categories,
p315
aVtry and target services at them more efficiently \u2014 in other words,
p316
aVthe very opposite of relational.
p317
aa(lp318
VBut guess how most people find work today?
p319
aVThrough word of mouth.
p320
aVIt turns out that in Britain today, most new jobs are not advertised.
p321
aVSo it's friends that tell you about a job,
p322
aVit's friends that recommend you for a job,
p323
aVand it's a rich and diverse social network that helps you find work.
p324
aVMaybe some of you here this evening are thinking,
p325
aV"But I found my job through an advert,"
p326
aVbut if you think back, it was probably a friend that showed you the ad
p327
aVand then encouraged you to apply.
p328
aVBut not surprisingly,
p329
aVpeople who perhaps most need this rich and diverse network
p330
aVare those who are most isolated from it.
p331
aa(lp332
VSo knowing this,
p333
aVand also knowing about the costs and failure of current systems,
p334
aVwe designed something new with relationships at its heart.
p335
aVWe designed a service that encourages people to meet up,
p336
aVpeople in and out of work,
p337
aVto work together in structured ways
p338
aVand try new opportunities.
p339
aVAnd, well, it's very hard to compare the results of these new systems
p340
aVwith the old transactional models,
p341
aVbut it looks like, with our first 1,000 members,
p342
aVwe outperformed existing services by a factor of three,
p343
aVat a fraction of the cost.
p344
aVAnd here, too, we've used technology,
p345
aVbut not to network people in the way that a social platform would do.
p346
aVWe've used it to bring people face to face and connect them with each other,
p347
aVbuilding real relationships and supporting people to find work.
p348
aa(lp349
VAt the end of his life, in 1948,
p350
aVBeveridge wrote a third report.
p351
aVAnd in it he said he had made a dreadful mistake.
p352
aVHe had left people and their communities out.
p353
aVAnd this omission, he said, led to seeing people,
p354
aVand people starting to see themselves,
p355
aVwithin the categories of the bureaucracies and the institutions.
p356
aVAnd human relationships were already withering.
p357
aVBut unfortunately, this third report was much less read
p358
aVthan Beveridge's earlier work.
p359
aa(lp360
VBut today, we need to bring people and their communities
p361
aVback into the heart of the way we design new systems and new services,
p362
aVin an approach that I call "Relational Welfare."
p363
aVWe need to leave behind these old, transactional,
p364
aVunsuitable, outdated models,
p365
aVand we need to adopt instead the shared collective relational responses
p366
aVthat can support a family like Ella's,
p367
aVthat can address an issue like loneliness,
p368
aVthat can support people into work and up the skills curve
p369
aVin a modern labor market,
p370
aVthat can also address challenges of education, of health care systems,
p371
aVand so many more of those problems that are pressing on our societies.
p372
aVIt is all about relationships.
p373
aVRelationships are the critical resource we have.
