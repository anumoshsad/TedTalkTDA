VThe advances that have taken place in astronomy,
p4
aVcosmology and biology, in the last 10 years,
p5
aVare really extraordinary \u2014
p6
aVto the point where we know more about our universe and how it works
p7
aVthan many of you might imagine.
p8
aVBut there was something else that I've noticed
p9
aVas those changes were taking place, as people were starting to find out that
p10
aVhmm ... yeah, there really is a black hole at the center of every galaxy.
p11
aVThe science writers and editors \u2014 I shouldn't say science writers,
p12
aVI should say people who write about science \u2014
p13
aVand editors would sit down over a couple of beers,
p14
aVafter a hard day of work, and start talking about
p15
aVsome of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd they would inevitably end up in what I thought was a very bizarre place,
p18
aVwhich is ways the world could end very suddenly.
p19
aVAnd that's what I want to talk about today. (Laughter)
p20
aVAh, you laugh, you fools. (Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
V(Voice: Can we finish up a little early?)
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter) Yeah, we need the time!
p25
aVStephen Petranek: At first, it all seemed a little fantastical to me, but after challenging a lot of these ideas,
p26
aVI began to take a lot of them seriously. And then September 11 happened,
p27
aVand I thought, ah, God,
p28
aVI can't go to the TED conference and talk about how the world is going to end.
p29
aVNobody wants to hear that. Not after this!
p30
aVAnd that got me into a discussion with some other people, other scientists,
p31
aVabout maybe some other subjects, and one of the guys I talked to,
p32
aVwho was a neuroscientist, said,
p33
aV"You know, I think there are a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up,"
p34
aVand reminds me of Michael's talk yesterday
p35
aVand his mother saying you can't have a solution if you don't have a problem.
p36
aVSo, we went out looking for solutions to ways that the world might end tomorrow,
p37
aVand lo and behold, we found them.
p38
aVWhich leads me to a videotape of a President Bush
p39
aVpress conference from a couple of weeks ago.
p40
aVCan we run that, Andrew?
p41
aa(lp42
VPresident George W. Bush: Whatever it costs to defend our security,
p43
aVand whatever it costs to defend our freedom, we must pay it.
p44
aa(lp45
VSP: I agree with the president.
p46
aVHe wants two trillion dollars to protect us from terrorists next year,
p47
aVa two-trillion-dollar federal budget, which will land us back into deficit spending real fast.
p48
aVBut terrorists aren't the only threat we face.
p49
aVThere are really serious calamities staring us in the eye
p50
aVthat we're in the same kind of denial about
p51
aVthat we were about terrorism, and what could've happened on September 11.
p52
aa(lp53
VI would propose, therefore, that if we took 10 billion dollars
p54
aVfrom that 2.13 trillion dollar budget \u2014
p55
aVwhich is two one hundredths of that budget \u2014
p56
aVand we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems
p57
aVI'm going to talk to you about, the vast majority could be solved,
p58
aVand the rest we could deal with. So, I hope you find this both fascinating \u2014
p59
aVI'm fascinated by this kind of stuff, I gotta admit \u2014
p60
aVto me these are Richard's cockroaches.
p61
aa(lp62
VBut I also hope, because I think the people in this room can literally change the world,
p63
aVI hope you take some of this stuff away with you,
p64
aVand when you have an opportunity to be influential,
p65
aVthat you try to get some heavy-duty money spent on some of these ideas.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo let's start. Number 10: we lose the will to survive.
p68
aVWe live in an incredible age of modern medicine.
p69
aVWe are all much healthier than we were 20 years ago.
p70
aVPeople around the world are getting better medicine \u2014
p71
aVbut mentally, we're falling apart.
p72
aVThe World Health Organization now estimates
p73
aVthat one out of five people on the planet is clinically depressed.
p74
aVAnd the World Health Organization also says that depression is the
p75
aVbiggest epidemic that humankind has ever faced.
p76
aa(lp77
VSoon, genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine
p78
aVare going to allow us to think of 100 as a normal lifespan.
p79
aVA female child born tomorrow, on average \u2014 median \u2014 will live to age 83.
p80
aVOur life longevity is going up almost a year for every year that passes.
p81
aVNow the problem with all of this, getting older,
p82
aVis that people over 65 are the most likely people to commit suicide.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo, what are the solutions?
p85
aVWe don't really have mental health insurance in this country,
p86
aVand it's \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 it's really a crime.
p87
aVSomething like 98 percent of all people with depression,
p88
aVand I mean really severe depression
p89
aV\u2014 I have a friend with stunningly severe depression
p90
aV\u2014 this is a curable disease, with present medicine and present technology.
p91
aVBut it is often a combination of talk therapy and pills.
p92
aVPills alone don't do it, especially in clinically depressed people.
p93
aVYou ought to be able to go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist,
p94
aVand put down your 10-dollar copay, and get treated,
p95
aVjust like you do when you got a cut on your arm. It's ridiculous.
p96
aa(lp97
VSecondly, drug companies are not going to develop really sophisticated
p98
aVpsychoactive drugs. We know that most mental illnesses have a biological
p99
aVcomponent that can be dealt with.
p100
aVAnd we know just an amazing amount more about the brain now than we
p101
aVdid 10 years ago. We need a pump-push from the federal government,
p102
aVthrough NIH and National Science \u2014 NSF \u2014
p103
aVand places like that to start helping the drug companies
p104
aVdevelop some advanced psychoactive drugs.
p105
aa(lp106
VMoving on. Number nine \u2014 don't laugh \u2014 aliens invade Earth.
p107
aVTen years ago, you couldn't have found an astronomer \u2014
p108
aVwell, very few astronomers \u2014 in the world who would've told you that
p109
aVthere are any planets anywhere outside our solar system.
p110
aV1995, we found three. The count now is up to 80 \u2014
p111
aVwe're finding about two or three a month.
p112
aVAll of the ones we've found, by the way, are in this little, teeny, tiny corner where we live,
p113
aVin the Milky Way. There must be millions of planets in the Milky Way,
p114
aVand as Carl Sagan insisted for many years,
p115
aVand was laughed at for it, there must be billions and billions in the universe.
p116
aVIn a few years, NASA is going to launch four or five telescopes out to Jupiter,
p117
aVwhere there's less dust, and start looking for Earth-like planets,
p118
aVwhich we cannot see with present technology, nor detect.
p119
aVIt's becoming obvious that the chance that life does not exist elsewhere in the universe,
p120
aVand probably fairly close to us, is a fairly remote idea.
p121
aVAnd the chance that some of it isn't more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea.
p122
aa(lp123
VRemember, we've only been an advanced civilization \u2014
p124
aVan industrial civilization, if you would \u2014 for 200 years.
p125
aVAlthough every time I go to Pompeii, I'm amazed that they had
p126
aVthe equivalent of a McDonald's on every street corner, too.
p127
aVSo, I don't know how much civilization really has progressed since AD 79,
p128
aVbut there's a great likelihood. I really believe this,
p129
aVand I don't believe in aliens, and I don't believe there are any aliens on the Earth
p130
aVor anything like that. But there's a likelihood that we will confront a
p131
aVcivilization that is more intelligent than our own.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow, what will happen? What if they come to, you know,
p134
aVsuck up our oceans for the hydrogen?
p135
aVAnd swat us away like flies, the way we swat away flies when we go into
p136
aVthe rainforest and start logging it.
p137
aVWe can look at our own history. The late physicist Gerard O'Neill said,
p138
aV"Advanced Western civilization has had a destructive effect
p139
aVon all primitive civilizations it has come in contact with,
p140
aVeven in those cases where every attempt was made
p141
aVto protect and guard the primitive civilization."
p142
aVIf the aliens come visiting, we're the primitive civilization.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo, what are the solutions to this? (Laughter)
p145
aVThank God you can all read!
p146
aVIt may seem ridiculous, but we have a really lousy history of anticipating things like this
p147
aVand actually being prepared for them.
p148
aVHow much energy and money does it take to actually have a plan
p149
aVto negotiate with an advanced species?
p150
aa(lp151
VSecondly \u2014 and you're going to hear more from me about this \u2014
p152
aVwe have to become an outward-looking, space-faring nation.
p153
aVWe have got to develop the
p154
aVidea that the Earth doesn't last forever,
p155
aVour sun doesn't last forever.
p156
aVIf we want humanity to last forever, we have to colonize the Milky Way.
p157
aVAnd that is not something that is beyond comprehension at this point.
p158
aV(Applause)
p159
aVIt'll also help us a lot, if we meet an advanced civilization along the way,
p160
aVif we're trying to be an advanced civilization. Number eight \u2014
p161
aa(lp162
V(Voice: Steve, that's what I'm doing after TED.) (Laughter) (Applause)
p163
aa(lp164
VSP: You've got it! You've got the job.
p165
aa(lp166
VNumber eight: the ecosystem collapses.
p167
aVLast July, in Science, the journal Science,
p168
aV19 oceanographers published a very, very unusual article.
p169
aVIt wasn't really a research report; it was a screed.
p170
aVThey said, we've been looking at the oceans for a long time now,
p171
aVand we want to tell you they're not in trouble, they're near collapse.
p172
aVMany other ecosystems on Earth are in real, real danger.
p173
aVWe're living in a time of mass extinctions that exceeds the fossil record
p174
aVby a factor of 10,000.
p175
aVWe have lost 25 percent of the unique species in Hawaii in the last 20 years.
p176
aVCalifornia is expected to lose 25 percent of its species in the next 40 years.
p177
aVSomewhere in the Amazon forest is the marginal tree.
p178
aVYou cut down that tree, the rain forest collapses as an ecosystem.
p179
aVThere's really a tree like that out there. That's really what it comes to.
p180
aVAnd when that ecosystem collapses, it could take a major ecosystem with it,
p181
aVlike our atmosphere. So, what do we do about this? What are the solutions?
p182
aa(lp183
VThere is some modeling of ecosystems going on now.
p184
aVThe problem with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly,
p185
aVthat we don't know they're really in trouble until it's almost too late.
p186
aVWe need to know earlier that they're getting in trouble,
p187
aVand we need to be able to pump possible solutions into models.
p188
aVAnd with the kind of computing power we have now,
p189
aVthere is, as I say, some of this going on, but it needs money.
p190
aVNational Science Foundation needs to say \u2014 you know,
p191
aValmost all the money that's spent on science in this country
p192
aVcomes from the federal government, one way or another.
p193
aVAnd they get to prioritize, you know?
p194
aVThere are people at the National Science Foundation
p195
aVwho get to say, this is the most important thing.
p196
aVThis is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about.
p197
aa(lp198
VSecondly, we need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet,
p199
aVand start moving them around.
p200
aVThere's been an experiment for the last four or five years on the Georges Bank,
p201
aVor the Grand Banks off of Newfoundland. It's a no-take fishing zone.
p202
aVThey can't fish there for a radius of 200 miles.
p203
aVAnd an amazing thing has happened: almost all the fish have come back,
p204
aVand they're reproducing like crazy. We're going to have to start doing this
p205
aVaround the globe. We're going to have to have no-take zones.
p206
aVWe're going to have to say, no more logging in the Amazon for 20 years.
p207
aVLet it recover, before we start logging again.
p208
aV(Applause)
p209
aa(lp210
VNumber seven: particle accelerator mishap.
p211
aVYou all remember Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber?
p212
aVOne of the things he raved about was that a particle accelerator experiment
p213
aVcould go haywire and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world.
p214
aVA lot of very sober-minded physicists, believe it or not,
p215
aVhave had exactly the same thought.
p216
aVThis spring \u2014 there's a collider at Brookhaven, on Long Island \u2014
p217
aVthis spring, it's going to have an experiment in which it creates black holes.
p218
aVThey are expecting to create little, tiny black holes.
p219
aVThey expect them to evaporate. (Laughter)
p220
aVI hope they're right. (Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
VOther collider experiments \u2014 there's one that's going to take place next summer
p223
aVat CERN \u2014 have the possibility of creating something called strangelets,
p224
aVwhich are kind of like antimatter. Whenever they hit other matter, they destroy it
p225
aVand obliterate it. Most physicists say that the accelerators we have now
p226
aVare not really powerful enough to create black holes and strangelets
p227
aVthat we need to worry about, and they're probably right.
p228
aVBut, all around the world, in Japan, in Canada,
p229
aVthere's talk about this, of reviving this in the United States.
p230
aVWe shut one down that was going to be big.
p231
aVBut there's talk of building very big accelerators.
p232
aVWhat can we do about this? What are the solutions?
p233
aa(lp234
VWe've got the fox watching the henhouse here.
p235
aVWe need to \u2014 we need the advice of particle physicists to talk about particle physics
p236
aVand what should be done in particle physics,
p237
aVbut we need some outside thinking and watchdogging
p238
aVof what's going on with these experiments.
p239
aa(lp240
VSecondly, we have a natural laboratory surrounding the Earth.
p241
aVWe have an electromagnetic field around the Earth,
p242
aVand it's constantly bombarded by high-energy particles, like protons.
p243
aVAnd in my opinion, we don't spend enough time
p244
aVlooking at that natural laboratory and figuring out first what's safe to do on Earth.
p245
aa(lp246
VNumber six: biotech disaster.
p247
aVIt's one of my favorite ones, because we've done several stories on Bt corn.
p248
aVBt corn is a corn that creates its own pesticide to kill a corn borer.
p249
aVYou may of heard of it \u2014 heard it called StarLink,
p250
aVespecially when all those taco shells were taken out of the supermarkets
p251
aVabout a year and a half ago.
p252
aVThis stuff was supposed to only be feed for animals in the United States,
p253
aVand it got into the human food supply, and somebody should've figured out
p254
aVthat it would get in the human food supply very easily.
p255
aVBut the thing that's alarming is a couple of months ago, in Mexico,
p256
aVwhere Bt corn and all genetically altered corn is totally illegal,
p257
aVthey found Bt corn genes in wild corn plants.
p258
aVNow, corn originated, we think, in Mexico.
p259
aVThis is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn.
p260
aVThis brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently,
p261
aVthat superweeds and superpests could spread around the world,
p262
aVfrom biotechnology, that literally could destroy the world's food supply
p263
aVin very short order.
p264
aa(lp265
VSo, what do we do about that?
p266
aVWe treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants.
p267
aVIt's that simple. This is an amazingly unregulated field.
p268
aVWhen the StarLink disaster happened, there was a battle between the
p269
aVEPA and the FDA over who really had authority, and over what parts of this,
p270
aVand they didn't get it straightened out for months. That's kind of crazy.
p271
aa(lp272
VNumber five, one of my favorites: reversal of the Earth's magnetic field.
p273
aVBelieve it or not, this happens every few hundred thousand years,
p274
aVand has happened many times in our history.
p275
aVNorth Pole goes to the South, South Pole goes to the North, and vice versa.
p276
aVBut what happens, as this occurs,
p277
aVis that we lose our magnetic field around the Earth over the period of about 100 years,
p278
aVand that means that all these cosmic rays and particles
p279
aVthat are to come streaming at us from the sun,
p280
aVthat this field protects us from, are \u2014 well, basically, we're gonna fry. (Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
V(Voice: Steve, I have some additional hats downstairs.)
p283
aa(lp284
VSP: So, what can we do about this? Oh, by the way, we're overdue.
p285
aVIt's been 780,000 years since this happened.
p286
aVSo, it should have happened about 480,000 years ago.
p287
aVOh, and here's one other thing.
p288
aVScientists think now our magnetic field may be diminished by about five percent.
p289
aVSo, maybe we're in the throes of it.
p290
aVOne of the problems of trying to figure out how healthy the Earth is,
p291
aVis that we have \u2014 you know, we don't have good weather data from 60 years ago,
p292
aVmuch less data on things like the ozone layer.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo, there's a fairly simple solution to this.
p295
aVThere's going to be a lot of cheap rocketry that's going to come online
p296
aVin about six or seven years
p297
aVthat gets us into the low atmosphere very cheaply.
p298
aVYou know, we can make ozone from car tailpipes.
p299
aVIt's not hard: it's just three oxygen atoms.
p300
aVIf you brought the entire ozone layer down to the surface of the Earth,
p301
aVit would be the thickness of two pennies, at 14 pounds per square inch.
p302
aVYou don't need that much up there.
p303
aVWe need to learn how to repair and replenish the Earth's ozone layer.
p304
aV(Applause)
p305
aa(lp306
VNumber four: giant solar flares.
p307
aVSolar flares are enormous magnetic outbursts from the Sun
p308
aVthat bombard the Earth with high-speed subatomic particles.
p309
aVSo far, our atmosphere has done, and our magnetic field has done
p310
aVpretty well protecting us from this.
p311
aVOccasionally, we get a flare from the Sun that causes havoc
p312
aVwith communications and so forth, and electricity.
p313
aVBut the alarming thing is that astronomers recently have been studying
p314
aVstars that are similar to our Sun,
p315
aVand they've found that a number of them, when they're about the age of our Sun,
p316
aVbrighten by a factor of as much as 20. Doesn't last for very long.
p317
aVAnd they think these are super-flares, millions of times more powerful
p318
aVthan any flares we've had from our Sun so far.
p319
aa(lp320
VObviously, we don't want one of those. (Laughter)
p321
aVThere's a flip side to it. In studying stars
p322
aVlike our Sun, we've found that they go through periods of diminishment,
p323
aVwhen their total amount of energy that's expelled from them
p324
aVgoes down by maybe one percent.
p325
aVOne percent doesn't sound like a lot, but it would cause one hell of an ice age here.
p326
aVSo, what can we do about this?
p327
aa(lp328
V(Laughter) Start terraforming Mars. This is one of my favorite subjects.
p329
aVI wrote a story about this in Life magazine in 1993.
p330
aVThis is rocket science, but it's not hard rocket science.
p331
aVEverything that we need to make an atmosphere on Mars,
p332
aVand to make a livable planet on Mars, is probably there.
p333
aVAnd you just, literally, have to send little nuclear factories up there
p334
aVthat gobble up the iron oxide on the surface of Mars and spit out the oxygen.
p335
aVThe problem is it takes 300 years to terraform Mars, minimum.
p336
aVReally more like 500 years to do it right.
p337
aVThere's no reason why we shouldn't start now. (Laughter)
p338
aa(lp339
VNumber three \u2014 isn't this stuff cool? (Laughter)
p340
aVA new global epidemic. People have been at war with germs
p341
aVever since there have been people,
p342
aVand from time to time, the germs sure get the upper hand.
p343
aVIn 1918, we had a flu epidemic in the United States that killed 20 million people.
p344
aVThat was back when the population was around 100 million people.
p345
aVThe bubonic plague in Europe, in the Middle Ages,
p346
aVkilled one out of four Europeans.
p347
aVAIDS is coming back. Ebola seems to be rearing its head
p348
aVwith much too much frequency,
p349
aVand old diseases like cholera are becoming resistant to antibiotics.
p350
aVWe've all learned what \u2014 the kind of panic that can occur
p351
aVwhen an old disease rears its head, like anthrax.
p352
aa(lp353
VThe worst possibility is that a very simple germ, like staph,
p354
aVfor which we have one antibiotic that still works, mutates.
p355
aVAnd we know staph can do amazing things.
p356
aVA staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow genes from it
p357
aVwhen antibiotics come, and change and mutate.
p358
aVThe danger is that some germ like staph will be \u2014
p359
aVwill mutate into something that's really virulent, very contagious,
p360
aVand will sweep through populations before we can do anything about it.
p361
aVThat's happened before. About 12,000 years ago,
p362
aVthere was a massive wave of mammal extinctions in the Americas,
p363
aVand that is thought to have been a virulent disease.
p364
aVSo, what can we do about it?
p365
aa(lp366
VIt is nuts. We give antibiotics \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p367
aVevery cow, every lamb, every chicken, they get antibiotics every day, all.
p368
aVYou know, you go to a restaurant, you eat fish, I got news for you,
p369
aVit's all farmed. You know, you gotta ask when you go to a restaurant if it's a wild fish,
p370
aVcause they're not going to tell you. We're giving away the code.
p371
aVThis is like being at war and giving somebody your secret code.
p372
aVWe're telling the germs out there how to fight us.
p373
aVWe gotta fix that. We gotta outlaw that right away.
p374
aa(lp375
VSecondly, our public health system, as we saw with anthrax, is a real disaster.
p376
aVWe have a real, major outbreak of disease in the United States,
p377
aVwe are not prepared to cope with it.
p378
aVNow, there is money in the federal budget, next year,
p379
aVto build up the public health service.
p380
aVBut I don't think to any extent that it really needs to be done.
p381
aa(lp382
VNumber two \u2014 my favorite \u2014 we meet a rogue black hole.
p383
aVYou know, 10 years ago, or 15 years ago, really,
p384
aVyou walk into an astronomy convention, and you say,
p385
aV"You know, there's probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy,"
p386
aVand they're going to hoot you off the stage.
p387
aVAnd now, if you went into one of those conventions and you said,
p388
aV"Well, I don't think black holes are out there," they'd hoot you off the stage.
p389
aVOur comprehension of the way the universe works is really \u2014
p390
aVhas just gained unbelievably in recent years.
p391
aa(lp392
VWe think that there are about 10 million dead stars in the Milky Way alone, our galaxy.
p393
aVAnd these stars have compressed down to maybe something like 12, 15 miles wide,
p394
aVand they are black holes. And they are gobbling up everything around them,
p395
aVincluding light, which is why we can't see them.
p396
aVMost of them should be in orbit around something.
p397
aVBut galaxies are very violent places, and things can be spun out of orbit.
p398
aVAnd also, space is incredibly vast.
p399
aVSo even if you flung a million of these things out of orbit,
p400
aVthe chances that one would actually hit us is fairly remote.
p401
aVBut it only has to get close, about a billion miles away, one of these things.
p402
aVAbout a billion miles away, here's what happens to Earth's orbit:
p403
aVit becomes elliptical instead of circular.
p404
aVAnd for three months out of the year,
p405
aVthe surface temperatures go up to 150 to 180.
p406
aVFor three months out of the year, they go to 50 below zero.
p407
aVThat won't work too well. What can we do about this?
p408
aVAnd this is my scariest. (Laughter)
p409
aVI don't have a good answer for this one.
p410
aVAgain, we gotta think about being a colonizing race.
p411
aa(lp412
VAnd finally, number one: biggest danger to life as we know it, I think,
p413
aVa really big asteroid heads for Earth.
p414
aVThe important thing to remember here \u2014 this is not a question of if,
p415
aVthis is a question of when, and how big.
p416
aVIn 1908, just a 200-foot piece of a comet
p417
aVexploded over Siberia and flattened forests for maybe 100 miles.
p418
aVIt had the effect of about 1,000 Hiroshima bombs.
p419
aVAstronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years.
p420
aVIn 1989, a large asteroid passed 400,000 miles away from Earth.
p421
aa(lp422
VNothing to worry about, right?
p423
aVIt passed directly through Earth's orbit. We were in that that spot six hours earlier.
p424
aVA small asteroid, say a half mile wide, would touch off firestorms
p425
aVfollowed by severe global cooling from the debris kicked up \u2014
p426
aVCarl Sagan's nuclear winter thing.
p427
aVAn asteroid five miles wide causes major extinctions.
p428
aVWe think the one that got the dinosaurs was about five miles wide.
p429
aVWhere are they? There's something called the Kuiper belt,
p430
aVwhich \u2014 some people think Pluto's not a planet,
p431
aVthat's where Pluto is, it's in the Kuiper belt.
p432
aVThere's also something a little farther out, called the Oort cloud.
p433
aVThere are about 100,000 balls of ice and rock \u2014 comets, really \u2014
p434
aVout there, that are 50 miles in diameter or more,
p435
aVand they regularly take a little spin,
p436
aVin towards the Sun and pass reasonably close to us.
p437
aVOf more concern, I think, is the asteroids that exist between Mars and Jupiter.
p438
aVThe folks at the Sloan Digital Sky Survey told us last fall \u2014
p439
aVthey're making the first map of the universe, three-dimensional map of the universe \u2014
p440
aVthat there are probably 700,000 asteroids between Mars and Jupiter
p441
aVthat are a half a mile big or bigger.
p442
aVSo you say, yeah, well, what are really the chances of this happening?
p443
aVAndrew, can you put that chart up?
p444
aa(lp445
VThis is a chart that Dr. Clark Chapman at the Southwest Research Institute
p446
aVpresented to Congress a few years ago.
p447
aVYou'll notice that the chance of an asteroid-slash-comet impact killing you
p448
aVis about one in 20,000, according to the work they've done.
p449
aVNow look at the one right below that.
p450
aVPassenger aircraft crash, one in 20,000.
p451
aVWe spend an awful lot of money trying to be sure that we don't die in airplane accidents,
p452
aVand we're not spending hardly anything on this. And yet, this is completely preventable.
p453
aVWe finally have, just in the last year, the technology to stop this cold.
p454
aVCould we have the solutions?
p455
aa(lp456
VNASA's spending three million dollars a year, three million bucks \u2014
p457
aVthat is like pocket change \u2014 to search for asteroids.
p458
aVBecause we can actually figure out every asteroid that's out there,
p459
aVand if it might hit Earth, and when it might hit Earth.
p460
aVAnd they're trying to do that.
p461
aVBut it's going to take them 10 years, at spending three million dollars a year,
p462
aVand even then, they claim they'll only have about 80 percent of them catalogued.
p463
aVComets are a tougher act.
p464
aVWe don't really have the technology to predict comet trajectories,
p465
aVor when one with our name on it might arrive.
p466
aVBut we would have lots of time, if we see it coming.
p467
aVWe really need a dedicated observatory.
p468
aVYou'll notice that a lot of comets are named after people you never heard of,
p469
aVamateur astronomers? That's because nobody's looking for them, except amateurs.
p470
aVWe need a dedicated observatory that looks for comets.
p471
aa(lp472
VPart two of the solutions: we need to figure out how to blow up an asteroid,
p473
aVor alter its trajectory. Now, a year ago, we did an amazing thing.
p474
aVWe sent a probe out to this asteroid belt,
p475
aVcalled NEAR, Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous.
p476
aVAnd these guys orbited a 30 \u2014 or no, about a 22-mile long asteroid called Eros.
p477
aVAnd then, of course, you know, they pulled one of those sneaky NASA things,
p478
aVwhere they had extra batteries and extra gas aboard and everything,
p479
aVand then, at the last minute, they landed.
p480
aVWhen the mission was over, they actually landed on the thing.
p481
aVWe have landed a rocket ship on an asteroid. It's not a big deal.
p482
aVNow, the trouble with just sending a bomb out for this thing
p483
aVis that you don't have anything to push against in space, because there's no air.
p484
aVA nuclear explosion is just as hot,
p485
aVbut we don't really have anything big enough to melt a 22-mile long asteroid,
p486
aVor vaporize it, would be more like it.
p487
aa(lp488
VBut we can learn to land on these asteroids that have our name on them
p489
aVand put something like a small ion propulsion motor on it,
p490
aVwhich would gently, slowly, after a period of time, push it into a different trajectory,
p491
aVwhich, if we've done our math right, would keep it from hitting Earth.
p492
aVThis is just a matter of finding 'em, going there, and doing something about it.
p493
aVI know your head is spinning from all this stuff.
p494
aVYikes! So many big threats!
p495
aa(lp496
VThe thing, I think, to remember, is September 11.
p497
aVWe don't want to get caught flat-footed again.
p498
aVWe know about this stuff.
p499
aVScience has the power to predict the future in many cases now.
p500
aVKnowledge is power.
p501
aVThe worst thing we can do is say, jeez, I got enough to worry about
p502
aVwithout worrying about an asteroid. (Laughter)
p503
aVThat's a mistake that could literally cost us our future.
