VSo it was the fall of 1902,
p4
aVand President Theodore Roosevelt
p5
aVneeded a little break from the White House,
p6
aVso he took a train to Mississippi
p7
aVto do a little black bear hunting outside of a town
p8
aVcalled Smedes.
p9
aVThe first day of the hunt, they didn't see a single bear,
p10
aVso it was a big bummer for everyone,
p11
aVbut the second day, the dogs cornered one
p12
aVafter a really long chase, but by that point,
p13
aVthe president had given up
p14
aVand gone back to camp for lunch,
p15
aVso his hunting guide cracked the animal
p16
aVon the top of the head with the butt of his rifle,
p17
aVand then tied it up to a tree
p18
aVand started tooting away on his bugle
p19
aVto call Roosevelt back so he could have the honor
p20
aVof shooting it.
p21
aVThe bear was a female.
p22
aVIt was dazed, injured,
p23
aVseverely underweight, a little mangy-looking,
p24
aVand when Roosevelt saw this animal
p25
aVtied up to the tree,
p26
aVhe just couldn't bring himself to fire at it.
p27
aVHe felt like that would go against his code
p28
aVas a sportsman.
p29
aa(lp30
VA few days later, the scene was memorialized
p31
aVin a political cartoon back in Washington.
p32
aVIt was called "Drawing a Line in Mississippi,"
p33
aVand it showed Roosevelt with his gun down and his arm out,
p34
aVsparing the bear's life,
p35
aVand the bear was sitting on its hind legs
p36
aVwith these two big, frightened, wide eyes
p37
aVand little ears pricked up at the top of its head.
p38
aVIt looked really helpless, like you just wanted to
p39
aVsweep it up into your arms
p40
aVand reassure it.
p41
aVIt wouldn't have looked familiar at the time,
p42
aVbut if you go looking for the cartoon now,
p43
aVyou recognize the animal right away:
p44
aVIt's a teddy bear.
p45
aVAnd this is how the teddy bear was born.
p46
aVEssentially, toymakers took the bear from the cartoon,
p47
aVturned it into a plush toy, and then named it
p48
aVafter President Roosevelt \u2014 Teddy's bear.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd I do feel a little ridiculous
p51
aVthat I'm up here on this stage
p52
aVand I'm choosing to use my time
p53
aVto tell you about a 100-year-old story
p54
aVabout the invention of a squishy kid's toy,
p55
aVbut I'd argue that the invention of the teddy bear,
p56
aVinside that story is a more important story,
p57
aVa story about how dramatically our ideas
p58
aVabout nature can change,
p59
aVand also about how, on the planet right now,
p60
aVthe stories that we tell
p61
aVare dramatically changing nature.
p62
aa(lp63
VBecause think about the teddy bear.
p64
aVFor us, in retrospect, it feels like an obvious fit,
p65
aVbecause bears are so cute and cuddly,
p66
aVand who wouldn't want to give one to their kids to play with,
p67
aVbut the truth is that in 1902,
p68
aVbears weren't cute and cuddly.
p69
aVI mean, they looked the same,
p70
aVbut no one thought of them that way.
p71
aVIn 1902, bears were monsters.
p72
aVBears were something that frickin' terrified kids.
p73
aVFor generations at that point,
p74
aVthe bear had been a shorthand for all the danger
p75
aVthat people were encountering on the frontier,
p76
aVand the federal government was actually
p77
aVsystematically exterminating bears
p78
aVand lots of other predators too,
p79
aVlike coyotes and wolves.
p80
aVThese animals, they were being demonized.
p81
aVThey were called murderers
p82
aVbecause they killed people's livestock.
p83
aVOne government biologist, he explained this
p84
aVwar on animals like the bear by saying
p85
aVthat they no longer had a place
p86
aVin our advancing civilization,
p87
aVand so we were just clearing them out of the way.
p88
aVIn one 10-year period, close to half a million wolves
p89
aVhad been slaughtered.
p90
aVThe grizzly would soon be wiped out
p91
aVfrom 95 percent of its original territory,
p92
aVand whereas once there had been 30 million bison
p93
aVmoving across the plains, and you would have
p94
aVthese stories of trains having to stop
p95
aVfor four or five hours so that these thick,
p96
aVliving rivers of the animals could pour over the tracks,
p97
aVnow, by 1902, there were maybe  less than 100 left in the wild.
p98
aVAnd so what I'm saying is, the teddy bear was born
p99
aVinto the middle of this great spasm of extermination,
p100
aVand you can see it as a sign that
p101
aVmaybe some people deep down
p102
aVwere starting to feel conflicted about all that killing.
p103
aVAmerica still hated the bear and feared it,
p104
aVbut all of a sudden, America also wanted
p105
aVto give the bear a great big hug.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo this is something that I've been really curious about in the last few years.
p108
aVHow do we imagine animals,
p109
aVhow do we think and feel about them,
p110
aVand how do their reputations get written
p111
aVand then rewritten in our minds?
p112
aVWe're here living in the eye of a great storm
p113
aVof extinction where half the species on the planet
p114
aVcould be gone by the end of the century,
p115
aVand so why is it that we come to care about
p116
aVsome of those species and not others?
p117
aVWell, there's a new field, a relatively new field
p118
aVof social science that started looking at
p119
aVthese questions and trying to unpack the powerful
p120
aVand sometimes pretty schizophrenic relationships
p121
aVthat we have to animals,
p122
aVand I spent a lot of time looking through
p123
aVtheir academic journals,
p124
aVand all I can really say is that their findings
p125
aVare astonishingly wide-ranging.
p126
aVSo some of my favorites include that
p127
aVthe more television a person watches in Upstate New York,
p128
aVthe more he or she is afraid
p129
aVof being attacked by a black bear.
p130
aVIf you show a tiger to an American,
p131
aVthey're much more likely to assume that it's female
p132
aVand not male.
p133
aVIn a study where a fake snake
p134
aVand a fake turtle were put on the side of the road,
p135
aVdrivers hit the snake much more often than the turtle,
p136
aVand about three percent of drivers who hit the fake animals
p137
aVseemed to do it on purpose.
p138
aVWomen are more likely than men to get a
p139
aV"magical feeling" when they see dolphins in the surf.
p140
aVSixty-eight percent of mothers with
p141
aV"high feelings of entitlement and self-esteem"
p142
aVidentified with the dancing cats
p143
aVin a commercial for Purina. (Laughter)
p144
aVAmericans consider lobsters
p145
aVmore important than pigeons
p146
aVbut also much, much stupider.
p147
aVWild turkeys are seen as only slightly more dangerous than sea otters,
p148
aVand pandas are twice as lovable as ladybugs.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo some of this is physical, right?
p151
aVWe tend to sympathize more with animals that look like us,
p152
aVand especially that resemble human babies,
p153
aVso with big, forward-facing eyes
p154
aVand circular faces,
p155
aVkind of a roly-poly posture.
p156
aVThis is why, if you get a Christmas card from, like,
p157
aVyour great aunt in Minnesota,
p158
aVthere's usually a fuzzy penguin chick on it,
p159
aVand not something like a Glacier Bay wolf spider.
p160
aVBut it's not all physical, right?
p161
aVThere's a cultural dimension to how we think about animals,
p162
aVand we're telling stories about these animals,
p163
aVand like all stories,
p164
aVthey are shaped by the times and the places
p165
aVin which we're telling them.
p166
aVSo think about that moment
p167
aVback in 1902 again where a ferocious bear
p168
aVbecame a teddy bear.
p169
aVWhat was the context? Well, America was urbanizing.
p170
aVFor the first time, nearly a majority of people lived in cities,
p171
aVso there was a growing distance between us and nature.
p172
aVThere was a safe space where we could
p173
aVreconsider the bear and romanticize it.
p174
aVNature could only start to seem this pure and adorable
p175
aVbecause we didn't have to be afraid of it anymore.
p176
aVAnd you can see that cycle playing out
p177
aVagain and again with all kinds of animals.
p178
aVIt seems like we're always stuck between
p179
aVdemonizing a species and wanting to wipe it out,
p180
aVand then when we get very close to doing that,
p181
aVempathizing with it as an underdog
p182
aVand wanting to show it compassion.
p183
aVSo we exert our power,
p184
aVbut then we're unsettled
p185
aVby how powerful we are.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo for example, this is one of
p188
aVprobably thousands of letters and drawings
p189
aVthat kids sent to the Bush administration,
p190
aVbegging it to protect the polar bear
p191
aVunder the Endangered Species Act,
p192
aVand these were sent back in the mid-2000s,
p193
aVwhen awareness of climate change was suddenly surging.
p194
aVWe kept seeing that image of a polar bear
p195
aVstranded on a little ice floe
p196
aVlooking really morose.
p197
aVI spent days looking through these files.
p198
aVI really love them. This one's my favorite.
p199
aVIf you can see, it's a polar bear that's drowning
p200
aVand then it's also being eaten simultaneously
p201
aVby a lobster and a shark.
p202
aVThis one came from a kid named Fritz,
p203
aVand he's actually got a solution to climate change.
p204
aVHe's got it all worked out to an ethanol-based solution.
p205
aVHe says, "I feel bad about the polar bears.
p206
aVI like polar bears.
p207
aVEveryone can use corn juice for cars. From Fritz."
p208
aVSo 200 years ago, you would have Arctic explorers
p209
aVwriting about polar bears leaping into their boats
p210
aVand trying to devour them,
p211
aVeven if they lit the bear on fire,
p212
aVbut these kids don't see the polar bear that way,
p213
aVand actually they don't even see the polar bear
p214
aVthe way that I did back in the '80s.
p215
aVI mean, we thought of these animals
p216
aVas mysterious and terrifying lords of the Arctic.
p217
aVBut look now how quickly that climate change
p218
aVhas flipped the image of the animal in our minds.
p219
aVIt's gone from that bloodthirsty man-killer
p220
aVto this delicate, drowning victim,
p221
aVand when you think about it, that's kind of
p222
aVthe conclusion to the story
p223
aVthat the teddy bear started telling back in 1902,
p224
aVbecause back then, America had more or less
p225
aVconquered its share of the continent.
p226
aVWe were just getting around to
p227
aVpolishing off these last wild predators.
p228
aVNow, society's reach has expanded
p229
aVall the way to the top of the world,
p230
aVand it's made even these, the most remote,
p231
aVthe most powerful bears on the planet,
p232
aVseem like adorable and blameless victims.
p233
aa(lp234
VBut you know, there's also a postscript to the teddy bear story
p235
aVthat not a lot of people talk about.
p236
aVWe're going to talk about it,
p237
aVbecause even though it didn't really take long
p238
aVafter Roosevelt's hunt in 1902
p239
aVfor the toy to become a full-blown craze,
p240
aVmost people figured it was a fad,
p241
aVit was a sort of silly political novelty item
p242
aVand it would go away once the president left office,
p243
aVand so by 1909, when Roosevelt's successor,
p244
aVWilliam Howard Taft,
p245
aVwas getting ready to be inaugurated,
p246
aVthe toy industry was on the hunt
p247
aVfor the next big thing.
p248
aVThey didn't do too well.
p249
aa(lp250
VThat January, Taft was the guest of honor
p251
aVat a banquet in Atlanta,
p252
aVand for days in advance,
p253
aVthe big news was the menu.
p254
aVThey were going to be serving him
p255
aVa Southern specialty, a delicacy, really,
p256
aVcalled possum and taters.
p257
aVSo you would have a whole opossum
p258
aVroasted on a bed of sweet potatoes,
p259
aVand then sometimes they'd leave
p260
aVthe big tail on it like a big, meaty noodle.
p261
aVThe one brought to Taft's table
p262
aVweighed 18 pounds.
p263
aVSo after dinner, the orchestra started to play,
p264
aVand the guests burst into song,
p265
aVand all of a sudden, Taft was surprised
p266
aVwith the presentation of a gift
p267
aVfrom a group of local supporters,
p268
aVand this was a stuffed opossum toy,
p269
aVall beady-eyed and bald-eared,
p270
aVand it was a new product they were putting forward
p271
aVto be the William Taft presidency's answer
p272
aVto Teddy Roosevelt's teddy bear.
p273
aVThey were calling it the "billy possum."
p274
aVWithin 24 hours, the Georgia Billy Possum Company
p275
aVwas up and running, brokering deals
p276
aVfor these things nationwide,
p277
aVand the Los Angeles Times announced,
p278
aVvery confidently, "The teddy bear
p279
aVhas been relegated to a seat in the rear,
p280
aVand for four years, possibly eight,
p281
aVthe children of the United States
p282
aVwill play with billy possum."
p283
aVSo from that point, there was a fit of opossum fever.
p284
aVThere were billy possum postcards, billy possum pins,
p285
aVbilly possum pitchers for your cream at coffee time.
p286
aVThere were smaller billy possums on a stick
p287
aVthat kids could wave around like flags.
p288
aVBut even with all this marketing,
p289
aVthe life of the billy possum
p290
aVturned out to be just pathetically brief.
p291
aVThe toy was an absolute flop,
p292
aVand it was almost completely forgotten
p293
aVby the end of the year,
p294
aVand what that means is that the billy possum
p295
aVdidn't even make it to Christmastime,
p296
aVwhich when you think about it is
p297
aVa special sort of tragedy for a toy.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo we can explain that failure two ways.
p300
aVThe first, well, it's pretty obvious.
p301
aVI'm going to go ahead and say it out loud anyway:
p302
aVOpossums are hideous. (Laughter)
p303
aVBut maybe more importantly is that
p304
aVthe story of the billy possum was all wrong,
p305
aVespecially compared
p306
aVto the backstory of the teddy bear.
p307
aVThink about it: for most of human's evolutionary history,
p308
aVwhat's made bears impressive to us
p309
aVhas been their complete independence from us.
p310
aVIt's that they live these parallel lives
p311
aVas menaces and competitors.
p312
aVBy the time Roosevelt went hunting in Mississippi,
p313
aVthat stature was being crushed,
p314
aVand the animal that he had roped to a tree
p315
aVreally was a symbol for all bears.
p316
aVWhether those animals lived or died now
p317
aVwas entirely up to the compassion
p318
aVor the indifference of people.
p319
aVThat said something really ominous
p320
aVabout the future of bears,
p321
aVbut it also said something very  unsettling about who we'd become,
p322
aVif the survival of even an animal like that
p323
aVwas up to us now.
p324
aVSo now, a century later, if you're at all
p325
aVpaying attention to what's happening in the environment,
p326
aVyou feel that discomfort so much more intensely.
p327
aVWe're living now in an age of what scientists
p328
aVhave started to call "conservation reliance,"
p329
aVand what that term means is that we've disrupted
p330
aVso much that nature can't possibly stand on its own anymore,
p331
aVand most endangered species
p332
aVare only going to survive
p333
aVif we stay out there in the landscape
p334
aVriggging the world around them in their favor.
p335
aVSo we've gone hands-on
p336
aVand we can't ever take our hands off,
p337
aVand that's a hell of a lot of work.
p338
aVRight now, we're training condors
p339
aVnot to perch on power lines.
p340
aVWe teach whooping cranes to migrate south for the winter
p341
aVbehind little ultra-light airplanes.
p342
aVWe're out there feeding plague vaccine to ferrets.
p343
aVWe monitor pygmy rabbits with drones.
p344
aVSo we've gone from annihilating species
p345
aVto micromanaging the survival of a lot of species
p346
aVindefinitely, and which ones?
p347
aVWell, the ones that we've told
p348
aVcompelling stories about,
p349
aVthe ones we've decided ought to stick around.
p350
aVThe line between conservation and domestication
p351
aVis blurred.
p352
aa(lp353
VSo what I've been saying is that the stories
p354
aVthat we tell about wild animals are so subjective
p355
aVthey can be irrational
p356
aVor romanticized or sensationalized.
p357
aVSometimes they just have nothing to do with the facts.
p358
aVBut in a world of conservation reliance,
p359
aVthose stories have very real consequences,
p360
aVbecause now, how we feel about an animal
p361
aVaffects its survival
p362
aVmore than anything that you read about
p363
aVin ecology textbooks.
p364
aVStorytelling matters now.
p365
aVEmotion matters.
p366
aVOur imagination has become an ecological force.
p367
aVAnd so maybe the teddy bear worked in part
p368
aVbecause the legend of Roosevelt
p369
aVand that bear in Mississippi
p370
aVwas kind of like an allegory
p371
aVof this great responsibility that society
p372
aVwas just beginning to face up to back then.
p373
aVIt would be another 71 years
p374
aVbefore the Endangered Species Act was passed,
p375
aVbut really, here's its whole ethos
p376
aVboiled down into something like a scene
p377
aVyou'd see in a stained glass window.
p378
aVThe bear is a helpless victim tied to a tree,
p379
aVand the president of the United States
p380
aVdecided to show it some mercy.
p381
aVThank you.
