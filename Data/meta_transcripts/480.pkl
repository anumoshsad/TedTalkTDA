VThe new me is beauty.
p4
aa(lp5
V(Laughter)
p6
aVYeah, people used to say, "Norman's OK,
p7
aVbut if you followed what he said, everything would be usable
p8
aVbut it would be ugly."
p9
aVWell, I didn't have that in mind, so ...
p10
aa(lp11
VThis is neat.
p12
aVThank you for setting up my display.
p13
aVI mean, it's just wonderful.
p14
aVAnd I haven't the slightest idea of what it does or what it's good for,
p15
aVbut I want it.
p16
aVAnd that's my new life.
p17
aVMy new life is trying to understand what beauty is about,
p18
aVand "pretty," and "emotions."
p19
aVThe new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd so this is a Philippe Starck juicer, produced by Alessi.
p22
aVIt's just neat; it's fun. It's so much fun I have it in my house \u2014
p23
aVbut I have it in the entryway, I don't use it to make juice.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VIn fact, I bought the gold-plated special edition
p28
aVand it comes with a little slip of paper
p29
aVthat says, "Don't use this juicer to make juice."
p30
aVThe acid will ruin the gold plating.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VSo actually, I took a carton of orange juice
p35
aVand I poured it in the glass to take this picture.
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VBeneath it is a wonderful knife.
p40
aVIt's a Global cutting knife made in Japan.
p41
aVFirst of all, look at the shape \u2014 it's just wonderful to look at.
p42
aVSecond of all, it's really beautifully balanced:
p43
aVit holds well, it feels well.
p44
aVAnd third of all, it's so sharp, it just cuts.
p45
aVIt's a delight to use.
p46
aVAnd so it's got everything, right?
p47
aVIt's beautiful and it's functional.
p48
aVAnd I can tell you stories about it,
p49
aVwhich makes it reflective,
p50
aVand so you'll see I have a theory of emotion.
p51
aVAnd those are the three components.
p52
aa(lp53
VHiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab
p54
aVtook a ping-pong table and placed a projector above it,
p55
aVand on the ping-pong table they projected an image of water
p56
aVwith fish swimming in it.
p57
aVAnd as you play ping-pong, whenever the ball hits part of the table,
p58
aVthe ripples spread out and the fish run away.
p59
aVBut of course, then the ball hits the other side,
p60
aVthe ripples hit the \u2014 poor fish, they can't find any peace and quiet.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VIs that a good way to play ping-pong?
p65
aVNo. But is it fun?
p66
aVYeah! Yeah.
p67
aa(lp68
VOr look at Google.
p69
aVIf you type in, oh say, "emotion and design,"
p70
aVyou get 10 pages of results.
p71
aVSo Google just took their logo and they spread it out.
p72
aVInstead of saying, "You got 73,000 results.
p73
aVThis is one through 20. Next,"
p74
aVthey just give you as many o's as there are pages.
p75
aVIt's really simple and subtle.
p76
aVI bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it.
p77
aVThat's the subconscious mind
p78
aVthat sort of notices it \u2014 it probably is kind of pleasant
p79
aVand you didn't know why.
p80
aVAnd it's just clever.
p81
aVAnd of course, what's especially good is,
p82
aVif you type "design and emotion,"
p83
aVthe first response out of those 10 pages is my website.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VNow, the weird thing is Google lies,
p88
aVbecause if I type "design and emotion,"
p89
aVit says, "You don't need the 'and.' We do it anyway."
p90
aVSo, OK.
p91
aVSo I type "design emotion"
p92
aVand my website wasn't first again.
p93
aVIt was third.
p94
aVOh well, different story.
p95
aa(lp96
VThere was this wonderful review in The New York Times
p97
aVabout the MINI Cooper automobile.
p98
aVIt said, "You know, this is a car that has lots of faults.
p99
aVBuy it anyway.
p100
aVIt's so much fun to drive."
p101
aVAnd if you look at the inside of the car \u2014
p102
aVI mean, I loved it, I wanted to see it, I rented it,
p103
aVthis is me taking a picture while my son is driving \u2014
p104
aVand the inside of the car, the whole design is fun.
p105
aVIt's round, it's neat.
p106
aVThe controls work wonderfully.
p107
aVSo that's my new life; it's all about fun.
p108
aa(lp109
VI really have the feeling that pleasant things work better,
p110
aVand that never made any sense to me
p111
aVuntil I finally figured out \u2014 look ...
p112
aVI'm going to put a plank on the ground.
p113
aVSo, imagine I have a plank about two feet wide and 30 feet long
p114
aVand I'm going to walk on it, and you see I can walk on it without looking,
p115
aVI can go back and forth and I can jump up and down.
p116
aVNo problem.
p117
aVNow I'm going to put the plank 300 feet in the air \u2014
p118
aVand I'm not going to go near it, thank you.
p119
aVIntense fear paralyzes you.
p120
aVIt actually affects the way the brain works.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo, Paul Saffo, before his talk said that he didn't really have it down
p123
aVuntil just a few days or hours before the talk,
p124
aVand that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus.
p125
aVThat's what fear and anxiety does;
p126
aVit causes you to be \u2014 what's called depth-first processing \u2014
p127
aVto focus, not be distracted.
p128
aVAnd I couldn't force myself across that.
p129
aVNow some people can \u2014 circus workers, steel workers.
p130
aVBut it really changes the way you think.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd then, a psychologist, Alice Isen,
p133
aVdid this wonderful experiment.
p134
aVShe brought students in to solve problems.
p135
aVSo, she'd bring people into the room,
p136
aVand there'd be a string hanging down here
p137
aVand a string hanging down here.
p138
aVIt was an empty room, except for a table with a bunch of crap on it \u2014
p139
aVsome papers and scissors and stuff.
p140
aVAnd she'd bring them in,
p141
aVand she'd say,
p142
aV"This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life.
p143
aVWould you tie those two strings together?"
p144
aVSo they'd take one string and they'd pull it over here
p145
aVand they couldn't reach the other string.
p146
aVStill can't reach it.
p147
aVAnd, basically, none of them could solve it.
p148
aVYou bring in a second group of people,
p149
aVand you say, "Oh, before we start,
p150
aVI got this box of candy, and I don't eat candy.
p151
aVWould you like the box of candy?"
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd turns out they liked it, and it made them happy \u2014
p154
aVnot very happy, but a little bit of happy.
p155
aVAnd guess what \u2014 they solved the problem.
p156
aVAnd it turns out that when you're anxious
p157
aVyou squirt neural transmitters in the brain, which focuses you
p158
aVmakes you depth-first.
p159
aVAnd when you're happy \u2014 what we call positive valence \u2014
p160
aVyou squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes,
p161
aVwhich makes you a breadth-first problem solver:
p162
aVyou're more susceptible to interruption; you do out-of-the-box thinking.
p163
aVThat's what brainstorming is about, right?
p164
aVWith brainstorming we make you happy, we play games,
p165
aVand we say, "No criticism,"
p166
aVand you get all these weird, neat ideas.
p167
aVBut in fact, if that's how you always were you'd never get any work done
p168
aVbecause you'd be working along and say, "Oh, I got a new way of doing it."
p169
aVSo to get work done, you've got to set a deadline, right?
p170
aVYou've got be anxious.
p171
aVThe brain works differently
p172
aVif you're happy. Things work better because you're more creative.
p173
aVYou get a little problem, you say, "Ah, I'll figure it out."
p174
aVNo big deal.
p175
aa(lp176
VThere's something I call the visceral level of processing, and there will be visceral-level design.
p177
aVBiology \u2014 we have co-adapted through biology to like bright colors.
p178
aVThat's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits
p179
aVand bright plants, because you eat the fruit
p180
aVand you thereby spread the seed.
p181
aVThere's an amazing amount of stuff that's built into the brain.
p182
aVWe dislike bitter tastes, we dislike loud sounds,
p183
aVwe dislike hot temperatures, cold temperatures.
p184
aVWe dislike scolding voices. We dislike frowning faces;
p185
aVwe like symmetrical faces, etc., etc.
p186
aVSo that's the visceral level.
p187
aVIn design, you can express visceral in lots of ways,
p188
aVlike the choice of type fonts and the red for hot, exciting.
p189
aVOr the 1963 Jaguar:
p190
aVIt's actually a crummy car, falls apart all the time,
p191
aVbut the owners love it.
p192
aVAnd it's beautiful \u2014 it's in the Museum of Modern Art.
p193
aVA water bottle:
p194
aVYou buy it because of the bottle, not because of the water.
p195
aVAnd when people are finished, they don't throw it away.
p196
aVThey keep it for \u2014 you know, it's like the old wine bottles, you keep it for decoration
p197
aVor maybe fill it with water again, which proves it's not the water.
p198
aVIt's all about the visceral experience.
p199
aa(lp200
VThe middle level of processing is the behavioral level
p201
aVand that's actually where most of our stuff gets done.
p202
aVVisceral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.
p203
aVBehavioral is subconscious, you're unaware of it.
p204
aVAlmost everything we do is subconscious.
p205
aVI'm walking around the stage \u2014 I'm not attending to the control of my legs.
p206
aVI'm doing a lot; most of my talk is subconscious;
p207
aVit has been rehearsed and thought about a lot.
p208
aVMost of what we do is subconscious.
p209
aVAutomatic behavior \u2014 skilled behavior \u2014 is subconscious,
p210
aVcontrolled by the behavioral side.
p211
aVAnd behavioral design is all about feeling in control,
p212
aVwhich includes usability, understanding \u2014
p213
aVbut also the feel and heft.
p214
aa(lp215
VThat's why the Global knives are so neat.
p216
aVThey're so nicely balanced, so sharp,
p217
aVthat you really feel you're in control of the cutting.
p218
aVOr, just driving a high-performance sports car
p219
aVover a demanding curb \u2014
p220
aVagain, feeling that you are in complete control of the environment.
p221
aVOr the sensual feeling.
p222
aVThis is a Kohler shower, a waterfall shower,
p223
aVand actually, all those knobs beneath are also showerheads.
p224
aVIt will squirt you all around
p225
aVand you can stay in that shower for hours \u2014
p226
aVand not waste water, by the way,
p227
aVbecause it recirculates the same dirty water.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VOr this \u2014 this is a really neat teapot I found
p232
aVat high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago.
p233
aVIt's a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot.
p234
aVThat's kind of what the teapot looks like
p235
aVbut the way you use it is you lay it on its back,
p236
aVand you put tea in,
p237
aVand then you fill it with water.
p238
aVThe water then seeps over the tea.
p239
aVAnd the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right \u2014
p240
aVthe tea is to the right of this line.
p241
aVThere's a little ledge inside, so the tea is sitting there
p242
aVand the water is filling it up like that.
p243
aVAnd when the tea is ready, or almost ready, you tilt it.
p244
aVAnd that means the tea is partially covered
p245
aVwhile it completes the brewing.
p246
aVAnd when it's finished, you put it vertically,
p247
aVand now the tea is \u2014 you remember \u2014 above this line
p248
aVand the water only comes to here \u2014
p249
aVand so it keeps the tea out.
p250
aVOn top of that, it communicates,
p251
aVwhich is what emotion does.
p252
aa(lp253
VEmotion is all about acting; emotion is really about acting.
p254
aVIt's being safe in the world.
p255
aVCognition is about understanding the world, emotion is about interpreting it \u2014
p256
aVsaying good, bad, safe, dangerous,
p257
aVand getting us ready to act, which is why the muscles tense or relax.
p258
aVAnd that's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else \u2014
p259
aVbecause their muscles are acting, subconsciously,
p260
aVexcept that we've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion.
p261
aVWell, this has emotions if you like,
p262
aVbecause it signals the waiter that, "Hey, I'm finished. See \u2014 upright."
p263
aVAnd the waiter can come by and say, "Would you like more water?"
p264
aVIt's kind of neat. What a wonderful design.
p265
aa(lp266
VAnd the third level is reflective,
p267
aVwhich is, if you like the superego,
p268
aVit's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do,
p269
aVno control over the \u2014 doesn't see the senses,
p270
aVdoesn't control the muscles.
p271
aVIt looks over what's going on.
p272
aVIt's that little voice in your head
p273
aVthat's watching and saying, "That's good. That's bad."
p274
aVOr, "Why are you doing that? I don't understand."
p275
aVIt's that little voice in your head that's the seat of consciousness.
p276
aa(lp277
VHere's a great reflective product.
p278
aVOwners of the Hummer have said, "You know I've owned many cars in my life \u2014
p279
aVall sorts of exotic cars,
p280
aVbut never have I had a car that attracted so much attention."
p281
aVIt's about attention. It's about their image,
p282
aVnot about the car.
p283
aVIf you want a more positive model \u2014
p284
aVthis is the GM car.
p285
aVAnd the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment.
p286
aVAnd you'll buy it to protect the environment,
p287
aVeven though the first few cars are going to be really expensive
p288
aVand not perfected.
p289
aVBut that's reflective design as well.
p290
aVOr an expensive watch, so you can impress people \u2014
p291
aV"Oh gee, I didn't know you had that watch."
p292
aVAs opposed to this one,
p293
aVwhich is a pure behavioral watch,
p294
aVwhich probably keeps better time than the $13,000 watch I just showed you.
p295
aVBut it's ugly.
p296
aVThis is a clear Don Norman watch.
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd what's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other,
p299
aVthe visceral fear of falling
p300
aVagainst the reflective state saying, "It's OK. It's OK. It's safe. It's safe."
p301
aVIf that amusement park were rusty and falling apart, you'd never go on the ride.
p302
aVSo, it's pitting one against the other.
p303
aVThe other neat thing ...
p304
aa(lp305
V(Laughter)
p306
aa(lp307
VSo Jake Cress is this furniture maker,
p308
aVand he makes this unbelievable set of furniture.
p309
aVAnd this is his chair with claw,
p310
aVand the poor little chair has lost its ball
p311
aVand it's trying to get it back before anybody notices.
p312
aVAnd what's so neat about it is how you accept that story.
p313
aVAnd that's what's nice about emotion.
p314
aa(lp315
VSo that's the new me.
p316
aVI'm only saying positive things from now on.
