VI'm going to speak to you about the global refugee crisis
p4
aVand my aim is to show you that this crisis
p5
aVis manageable, not unsolvable,
p6
aVbut also show you that this is as much about us and who we are
p7
aVas it is a trial of the refugees on the front line.
p8
aa(lp9
VFor me, this is not just a professional obligation,
p10
aVbecause I run an NGO supporting refugees and displaced people around the world.
p11
aVIt's personal.
p12
aa(lp13
VI love this picture.
p14
aVThat really handsome guy on the right,
p15
aVthat's not me.
p16
aVThat's my dad, Ralph, in London, in 1940
p17
aVwith his father Samuel.
p18
aVThey were Jewish refugees from Belgium.
p19
aVThey fled the day the Nazis invaded.
p20
aVAnd I love this picture, too.
p21
aVIt's a group of refugee children
p22
aVarriving in England in 1946 from Poland.
p23
aVAnd in the middle is my mother, Marion.
p24
aVShe was sent to start a new life
p25
aVin a new country
p26
aVon her own
p27
aVat the age of 12.
p28
aVI know this:
p29
aVif Britain had not admitted refugees
p30
aVin the 1940s,
p31
aVI certainly would not be here today.
p32
aa(lp33
VYet 70 years on, the wheel has come full circle.
p34
aVThe sound is of walls being built,
p35
aVvengeful political rhetoric,
p36
aVhumanitarian values and principles on fire
p37
aVin the very countries that 70 years ago said never again
p38
aVto statelessness and hopelessness for the victims of war.
p39
aVLast year, every minute,
p40
aV24 more people were displaced from their homes
p41
aVby conflict, violence and persecution:
p42
aVanother chemical weapon attack in Syria,
p43
aVthe Taliban on the rampage in Afghanistan,
p44
aVgirls driven from their school in northeast Nigeria by Boko Haram.
p45
aVThese are not people moving to another country
p46
aVto get a better life.
p47
aVThey're fleeing for their lives.
p48
aa(lp49
VIt's a real tragedy
p50
aVthat the world's most famous refugee can't come to speak to you here today.
p51
aVMany of you will know this picture.
p52
aVIt shows the lifeless body
p53
aVof five-year-old Alan Kurdi,
p54
aVa Syrian refugee who died in the Mediterranean in 2015.
p55
aVHe died alongside 3,700 others trying to get to Europe.
p56
aVThe next year, 2016,
p57
aV5,000 people died.
p58
aVIt's too late for them,
p59
aVbut it's not too late for millions of others.
p60
aa(lp61
VIt's not too late for people like Frederick.
p62
aVI met him in the Nyarugusu refugee camp in Tanzania.
p63
aVHe's from Burundi.
p64
aVHe wanted to know where could he complete his studies.
p65
aVHe'd done 11 years of schooling. He wanted a 12th year.
p66
aVHe said to me, "I pray that my days do not end here
p67
aVin this refugee camp."
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd it's not too late for Halud.
p70
aVHer parents were Palestinian refugees
p71
aVliving in the Yarmouk refugee camp outside Damascus.
p72
aVShe was born to refugee parents,
p73
aVand now she's a refugee herself in Lebanon.
p74
aVShe's working for the International Rescue Committee to help other refugees,
p75
aVbut she has no certainty at all
p76
aVabout her future,
p77
aVwhere it is or what it holds.
p78
aa(lp79
VThis talk is about Frederick, about Halud
p80
aVand about millions like them:
p81
aVwhy they're displaced,
p82
aVhow they survive, what help they need and what our responsibilities are.
p83
aVI truly believe this,
p84
aVthat the biggest question in the 21st century
p85
aVconcerns our duty to strangers.
p86
aVThe future "you" is about your duties
p87
aVto strangers.
p88
aVYou know better than anyone,
p89
aVthe world is more connected than ever before,
p90
aVyet the great danger
p91
aVis that we're consumed by our divisions.
p92
aVAnd there is no better test of that
p93
aVthan how we treat refugees.
p94
aa(lp95
VHere are the facts: 65 million people
p96
aVdisplaced from their homes by violence and persecution last year.
p97
aVIf it was a country,
p98
aVthat would be the 21st largest country in the world.
p99
aVMost of those people, about 40 million, stay within their own home country,
p100
aVbut 25 million are refugees.
p101
aVThat means they cross a border into a neighboring state.
p102
aVMost of them are living in poor countries,
p103
aVrelatively poor or lower-middle-income countries, like Lebanon,
p104
aVwhere Halud is living.
p105
aVIn Lebanon, one in four people is a refugee,
p106
aVa quarter of the whole population.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd refugees stay for a long time.
p109
aVThe average length of displacement
p110
aVis 10 years.
p111
aVI went to what was the world's largest refugee camp, in eastern Kenya.
p112
aVIt's called Dadaab.
p113
aVIt was built in 1991-92
p114
aVas a "temporary camp" for Somalis fleeing the civil war.
p115
aVI met Silo.
p116
aVAnd naïvely I said to Silo,
p117
aV"Do you think you'll ever go home to Somalia?"
p118
aVAnd she said, "What do you mean, go home?
p119
aVI was born here."
p120
aVAnd then when I asked the camp management
p121
aVhow many of the 330,000 people in that camp were born there,
p122
aVthey gave me the answer:
p123
aV100,000.
p124
aVThat's what long-term displacement means.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow, the causes of this are deep:
p127
aVweak states that can't support their own people,
p128
aVan international political system
p129
aVweaker than at any time since 1945
p130
aVand differences over theology, governance, engagement with the outside world
p131
aVin significant parts of the Muslim world.
p132
aVNow, those are long-term, generational challenges.
p133
aVThat's why I say that this refugee crisis is a trend and not a blip.
p134
aVAnd it's complex, and when you have big, large, long-term, complex problems,
p135
aVpeople think nothing can be done.
p136
aa(lp137
VWhen Pope Francis went to Lampedusa,
p138
aVoff the coast of Italy, in 2014,
p139
aVhe accused all of us and the global population
p140
aVof what he called "the globalization of indifference."
p141
aVIt's a haunting phrase.
p142
aVIt means that our hearts have turned to stone.
p143
aVNow, I don't know, you tell me.
p144
aVAre you allowed to argue with the Pope, even at a TED conference?
p145
aVBut I think it's not right.
p146
aVI think people do want to make a difference,
p147
aVbut they just don't know whether there are any solutions to this crisis.
p148
aVAnd what I want to tell you today
p149
aVis that though the problems are real, the solutions are real, too.
p150
aa(lp151
VSolution one:
p152
aVthese refugees need to get into work in the countries where they're living,
p153
aVand the countries where they're living need massive economic support.
p154
aVIn Uganda in 2014, they did a study:
p155
aV80 percent of refugees in the capital city Kampala
p156
aVneeded no humanitarian aid because they were working.
p157
aVThey were supported into work.
p158
aa(lp159
VSolution number two:
p160
aVeducation for kids is a lifeline, not a luxury,
p161
aVwhen you're displaced for so long.
p162
aVKids can bounce back when they're given the proper social, emotional support
p163
aValongside literacy and numeracy.
p164
aVI've seen it for myself.
p165
aVBut half of the world's refugee children of primary school age
p166
aVget no education at all,
p167
aVand three-quarters of secondary school age get no education at all.
p168
aVThat's crazy.
p169
aa(lp170
VSolution number three:
p171
aVmost refugees are in urban areas, in cities, not in camps.
p172
aVWhat would you or I want if we were a refugee in a city?
p173
aVWe would want money to pay rent or buy clothes.
p174
aVThat is the future of the humanitarian system,
p175
aVor a significant part of it:
p176
aVgive people cash so that you boost the power of refugees
p177
aVand you'll help the local economy.
p178
aa(lp179
VAnd there's a fourth solution, too,
p180
aVthat's controversial but needs to be talked about.
p181
aVThe most vulnerable refugees need to be given a new start
p182
aVand a new life in a new country,
p183
aVincluding in the West.
p184
aVThe numbers are relatively small, hundreds of thousands, not millions,
p185
aVbut the symbolism is huge.
p186
aVNow is not the time to be banning refugees,
p187
aVas the Trump administration proposes.
p188
aVIt's a time to be embracing people who are victims of terror.
p189
aVAnd remember \u2014
p190
aa(lp191
V(Applause)
p192
aa(lp193
VRemember, anyone who asks you, "Are they properly vetted?"
p194
aVthat's a really sensible and good question to ask.
p195
aVThe truth is, refugees arriving for resettlement
p196
aVare more vetted than any other population arriving in our countries.
p197
aVSo while it's reasonable to ask the question,
p198
aVit's not reasonable to say that refugee is another word for terrorist.
p199
aa(lp200
VNow, what happens \u2014
p201
aa(lp202
V(Applause)
p203
aa(lp204
VWhat happens when refugees can't get work,
p205
aVthey can't get their kids into school,
p206
aVthey can't get cash, they can't get a legal route to hope?
p207
aVWhat happens is they take risky journeys.
p208
aVI went to Lesbos, this beautiful Greek island, two years ago.
p209
aVIt's a home to 90,000 people.
p210
aVIn one year, 500,000 refugees went across the island.
p211
aVAnd I want to show you what I saw
p212
aVwhen I drove across to the north of the island:
p213
aVa pile of life jackets of those who had made it to shore.
p214
aVAnd when I looked closer,
p215
aVthere were small life jackets for children,
p216
aVyellow ones.
p217
aVAnd I took this picture.
p218
aVYou probably can't see the writing, but I want to read it for you.
p219
aV"Warning: will not protect against drowning."
p220
aVSo in the 21st century,
p221
aVchildren are being given life jackets
p222
aVto reach safety in Europe
p223
aVeven though those jackets will not save their lives
p224
aVif they fall out of the boat that is taking them there.
p225
aa(lp226
VThis is not just a crisis, it's a test.
p227
aVIt's a test that civilizations have faced down the ages.
p228
aVIt's a test of our humanity.
p229
aVIt's a test of us in the Western world
p230
aVof who we are and what we stand for.
p231
aVIt's a test of our character, not just our policies.
p232
aVAnd refugees are a hard case.
p233
aVThey do come from faraway parts of the world.
p234
aVThey have been through trauma.
p235
aVThey're often of a different religion.
p236
aVThose are precisely the reasons we should be helping refugees,
p237
aVnot a reason not to help them.
p238
aVAnd it's a reason to help them because of what it says about us.
p239
aVIt's revealing of our values.
p240
aVEmpathy and altruism are two of the foundations of civilization.
p241
aVTurn that empathy and altruism into action
p242
aVand we live out a basic moral credo.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd in the modern world, we have no excuse.
p245
aVWe can't say we don't know what's happening in Juba, South Sudan,
p246
aVor Aleppo, Syria.
p247
aVIt's there, in our smartphone
p248
aVin our hand.
p249
aVIgnorance is no excuse at all.
p250
aVFail to help, and we show we have no moral compass at all.
p251
aa(lp252
VIt's also revealing about whether we know our own history.
p253
aVThe reason that refugees have rights around the world
p254
aVis because of extraordinary Western leadership
p255
aVby statesmen and women after the Second World War
p256
aVthat became universal rights.
p257
aVTrash the protections of refugees, and we trash our own history.
p258
aVThis is \u2014
p259
aa(lp260
V(Applause)
p261
aa(lp262
VThis is also revealing about the power of democracy
p263
aVas a refuge from dictatorship.
p264
aVHow many politicians have you heard say,
p265
aV"We believe in the power of our example, not the example of our power."
p266
aVWhat they mean is what we stand for is more important than the bombs we drop.
p267
aVRefugees seeking sanctuary
p268
aVhave seen the West as a source of hope and a place of haven.
p269
aVRussians, Iranians,
p270
aVChinese, Eritreans, Cubans,
p271
aVthey've come to the West for safety.
p272
aVWe throw that away at our peril.
p273
aa(lp274
VAnd there's one other thing it reveals about us:
p275
aVwhether we have any humility for our own mistakes.
p276
aVI'm not one of these people
p277
aVwho believes that all the problems in the world are caused by the West.
p278
aVThey're not.
p279
aVBut when we make mistakes, we should recognize it.
p280
aVIt's not an accident that the country which has taken
p281
aVmore refugees than any other, the United States,
p282
aVhas taken more refugees from Vietnam than any other country.
p283
aVIt speaks to the history.
p284
aVBut there's more recent history, in Iraq and Afghanistan.
p285
aVYou can't make up for foreign policy errors
p286
aVby humanitarian action,
p287
aVbut when you break something, you have a duty to try to help repair it,
p288
aVand that's our duty now.
p289
aa(lp290
VDo you remember at the beginning of the talk,
p291
aVI said I wanted to explain that the refugee crisis
p292
aVwas manageable, not insoluble?
p293
aVThat's true. I want you to think in a new way,
p294
aVbut I also want you to do things.
p295
aVIf you're an employer,
p296
aVhire refugees.
p297
aVIf you're persuaded by the arguments,
p298
aVtake on the myths
p299
aVwhen family or friends or workmates repeat them.
p300
aVIf you've got money, give it to charities
p301
aVthat make a difference for refugees around the world.
p302
aVIf you're a citizen,
p303
aVvote for politicians
p304
aVwho will put into practice the solutions that I've talked about.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Applause)
p307
aa(lp308
VThe duty to strangers
p309
aVshows itself
p310
aVin small ways and big,
p311
aVprosaic and heroic.
p312
aVIn 1942,
p313
aVmy aunt and my grandmother were living in Brussels
p314
aVunder German occupation.
p315
aVThey received a summons
p316
aVfrom the Nazi authorities to go to Brussels Railway Station.
p317
aVMy grandmother immediately thought something was amiss.
p318
aVShe pleaded with her relatives
p319
aVnot to go to Brussels Railway Station.
p320
aVHer relatives said to her,
p321
aV"If we don't go, if we don't do what we're told,
p322
aVthen we're going to be in trouble."
p323
aVYou can guess what happened
p324
aVto the relatives who went to Brussels Railway Station.
p325
aVThey were never seen again.
p326
aVBut my grandmother and my aunt,
p327
aVthey went to a small village
p328
aVsouth of Brussels
p329
aVwhere they'd been on holiday in the decade before,
p330
aVand they presented themselves at the house of the local farmer,
p331
aVa Catholic farmer called Monsieur Maurice,
p332
aVand they asked him to take them in.
p333
aVAnd he did,
p334
aVand by the end of the war,
p335
aV17 Jews, I was told, were living in that village.
p336
aa(lp337
VAnd when I was teenager, I asked my aunt,
p338
aV"Can you take me to meet Monsieur Maurice?"
p339
aVAnd she said, "Yeah, I can. He's still alive. Let's go and see him."
p340
aVAnd so, it must have been '83, '84,
p341
aVwe went to see him.
p342
aVAnd I suppose, like only a teenager could,
p343
aVwhen I met him,
p344
aVhe was this white-haired gentleman,
p345
aVI said to him,
p346
aV"Why did you do it?
p347
aVWhy did you take that risk?"
p348
aVAnd he looked at me and he shrugged,
p349
aVand he said, in French,
p350
aV"On doit."
p351
aV"One must."
p352
aVIt was innate in him.
p353
aVIt was natural.
p354
aVAnd my point to you is it should be natural and innate in us, too.
p355
aVTell yourself,
p356
aVthis refugee crisis is manageable,
p357
aVnot unsolvable,
p358
aVand each one of us
p359
aVhas a personal responsibility to help make it so.
p360
aVBecause this is about the rescue of us and our values
p361
aVas well as the rescue of refugees and their lives.
p362
aa(lp363
VThank you very much indeed.
p364
aa(lp365
V(Applause)
p366
aa(lp367
VBruno Giussani: David, thank you. David Miliband: Thank you.
p368
aa(lp369
VBG: Those are strong suggestions
p370
aVand your call for individual responsibility is very strong as well,
p371
aVbut I'm troubled by one thought, and it's this:
p372
aVyou mentioned, and these are your words, "extraordinary Western leadership"
p373
aVwhich led 60-something years ago
p374
aVto the whole discussion about human rights,
p375
aVto the conventions on refugees, etc. etc.
p376
aVThat leadership happened after a big trauma
p377
aVand happened in a consensual political space,
p378
aVand now we are in a divisive political space.
p379
aVActually, refugees have become one of the divisive issues.
p380
aVSo where will leadership come from today?
p381
aa(lp382
VDM: Well, I think that you're right to say
p383
aVthat the leadership forged in war
p384
aVhas a different temper and a different tempo
p385
aVand a different outlook
p386
aVthan leadership forged in peace.
p387
aVAnd so my answer would be the leadership has got to come from below,
p388
aVnot from above.
p389
aVI mean, a recurring theme of the conference this week
p390
aVhas been about the democratization of power.
p391
aVAnd we've got to preserve our own democracies,
p392
aVbut we've got to also activate our own democracies.
p393
aVAnd when people say to me,
p394
aV"There's a backlash against refugees,"
p395
aVwhat I say to them is,
p396
aV"No, there's a polarization,
p397
aVand at the moment,
p398
aVthose who are fearful are making more noise
p399
aVthan those who are proud."
p400
aVAnd so my answer to your question is that we will sponsor and encourage
p401
aVand give confidence to leadership
p402
aVwhen we mobilize ourselves.
p403
aVAnd I think that when you are in a position of looking for leadership,
p404
aVyou have to look inside
p405
aVand mobilize in your own community
p406
aVto try to create conditions for a different kind of settlement.
p407
aa(lp408
