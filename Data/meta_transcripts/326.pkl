VAs a particle physicist, I study the elementary particles
p4
aVand how they interact on the most fundamental level.
p5
aVFor most of my research career, I've been using accelerators,
p6
aVsuch as the electron accelerator at Stanford University, just up the road,
p7
aVto study things on the smallest scale.
p8
aVBut more recently, I've been turning my attention
p9
aVto the universe on the largest scale.
p10
aVBecause, as I'll explain to you,
p11
aVthe questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected.
p12
aVSo I'm going to tell you about our twenty-first-century view of the universe,
p13
aVwhat it's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are \u2014
p14
aVat least some of the big questions.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo, recently, we have realized
p17
aVthat the ordinary matter in the universe \u2014
p18
aVand by ordinary matter, I mean you, me,
p19
aVthe planets, the stars, the galaxies \u2014
p20
aVthe ordinary matter makes up only a few percent
p21
aVof the content of the universe.
p22
aVAlmost a quarter, or approximately a quarter
p23
aVof the matter in the universe, is stuff that's invisible.
p24
aVBy invisible, I mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum.
p25
aVIt doesn't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't reflect.
p26
aVIt doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum,
p27
aVwhich is what we use to detect things.
p28
aVIt doesn't interact at all. So how do we know it's there?
p29
aVWe know it's there by its gravitational effects.
p30
aVIn fact, this dark matter dominates
p31
aVthe gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale,
p32
aVand I'll be telling you about the evidence for that.
p33
aa(lp34
VWhat about the rest of the pie?
p35
aVThe rest of the pie is a very mysterious substance called dark energy.
p36
aVMore about that later, OK.
p37
aVSo for now, let's turn to the evidence for dark matter.
p38
aVIn these galaxies, especially in a spiral galaxy like this,
p39
aVmost of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy.
p40
aVThis huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy.
p41
aVSo we have these stars going around in circles like this.
p42
aVAs you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK \u2014
p43
aVthat stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed
p44
aVthan those that are further out here, OK.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo what you would expect is that if you measured the orbital speed of the stars,
p47
aVthat they should be slower on the edges than on the inside.
p48
aVIn other words, if we measured speed as a function of distance \u2014
p49
aVthis is the only time I'm going to show a graph, OK \u2014
p50
aVwe would expect that it goes down as the distance increases
p51
aVfrom the center of the galaxy.
p52
aVWhen those measurements are made,
p53
aVinstead what we find is that the speed is basically constant,
p54
aVas a function of distance.
p55
aVIf it's constant, that means that the stars out here
p56
aVare feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see.
p57
aVIn fact, this galaxy and every other galaxy
p58
aVappears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter.
p59
aVAnd this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves,
p60
aVand it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy.
p61
aVSo we see the galaxy and fixate on that, but it's actually a cloud of dark matter
p62
aVthat's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy.
p63
aa(lp64
VGalaxies themselves are not strewn randomly in space;
p65
aVthey tend to cluster.
p66
aVAnd this is an example of a very, actually, famous cluster, the Coma cluster.
p67
aVAnd there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster.
p68
aVThey're the white, fuzzy, elliptical things here.
p69
aVSo these galaxy clusters \u2014 we take a snapshot now,
p70
aVwe take a snapshot in a decade, it'll look identical.
p71
aVBut these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds.
p72
aVThey're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster, OK.
p73
aVSo all of these galaxies are moving.
p74
aVWe can measure the speeds of these galaxies, their orbital velocities,
p75
aVand figure out how much mass is in this cluster.
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd again, what we find is that there is much more mass there
p78
aVthan can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see.
p79
aVOr if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum,
p80
aVwe see that there's a lot of gas in this cluster, as well.
p81
aVBut that cannot account for the mass either.
p82
aVIn fact, there appears to be about ten times as much mass here
p83
aVin the form of this invisible or dark matter
p84
aVas there is in the ordinary matter, OK.
p85
aVIt would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly.
p86
aVI'm just putting this big, blue blob on there, OK,
p87
aVto try to remind you that it's there.
p88
aVCan we see it more visually? Yes, we can.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd so let me lead you through how we can do this.
p91
aVSo here's an observer:
p92
aVit could be an eye; it could be a telescope.
p93
aVAnd suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe.
p94
aVHow do we see that galaxy?
p95
aVA ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe
p96
aVfor perhaps billions of years
p97
aVbefore it enters the telescope or your eye.
p98
aVNow, how do we deduce where the galaxy is?
p99
aVWell, we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling
p100
aVas it enters our eye, right?
p101
aVWe say, the ray of light came this way;
p102
aVthe galaxy must be there, OK.
p103
aVNow, suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies \u2014
p104
aVand don't forget the dark matter, OK.
p105
aVNow, if we consider a different ray of light, one going off like this,
p106
aVwe now need to take into account
p107
aVwhat Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity.
p108
aVAnd that was that the gravitational field, due to mass,
p109
aVwill deflect not only the trajectory of particles,
p110
aVbut will deflect light itself.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo this light ray will not continue in a straight line,
p113
aVbut would rather bend and could end up going into our eye.
p114
aVWhere will this observer see the galaxy?
p115
aVYou can respond. Up, right?
p116
aVWe extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here.
p117
aVIs there any other ray of light
p118
aVthat could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy?
p119
aVYes, great. I see people going down like this.
p120
aVSo a ray of light could go down, be bent
p121
aVup into the observer's eye,
p122
aVand the observer sees a ray of light here.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow, take into account the fact that we live in
p125
aVa three-dimensional universe, OK,
p126
aVa three-dimensional space.
p127
aVAre there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye?
p128
aVYes! The rays would lie on a \u2014 I'd like to see \u2014 yeah, on a cone.
p129
aVSo there's a whole ray of light \u2014 rays of light on a cone \u2014
p130
aVthat will all be bent by that cluster
p131
aVand make it into the observer's eye.
p132
aVIf there is a cone of light coming into my eye, what do I see?
p133
aVA circle, a ring. It's called an Einstein ring. Einstein predicted that, OK.
p134
aVNow, it will only be a perfect ring if the source, the deflector
p135
aVand the eyeball, in this case, are all in a perfectly straight line.
p136
aVIf they're slightly skewed, we'll see a different image.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow, you can do an experiment tonight over the reception, OK,
p139
aVto figure out what that image will look like.
p140
aVBecause it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise,
p141
aVthat has the right shape to produce this kind of effect.
p142
aVWe call this gravitational lensing.
p143
aVAnd so, this is your instrument, OK.
p144
aV(Laughter).
p145
aVBut ignore the top part.
p146
aVIt's the base that I want you to concentrate, OK.
p147
aVSo, actually, at home, whenever we break a wineglass,
p148
aVI save the bottom, take it over to the machine shop.
p149
aVWe shave it off, and I have a little gravitational lens, OK.
p150
aVSo it's got the right shape to produce the lensing.
p151
aVAnd so the next thing you need to do in your experiment
p152
aVis grab a napkin. I grabbed a piece of graph paper \u2014 I'm a physicist. (Laughter)
p153
aVSo, a napkin. Draw a little model galaxy in the middle.
p154
aVAnd now put the lens over the galaxy,
p155
aVand what you'll find is that you'll see a ring, an Einstein ring.
p156
aVNow, move the base off to the side,
p157
aVand the ring will split up into arcs, OK.
p158
aVAnd you can put it on top of any image.
p159
aVOn the graph paper, you can see
p160
aVhow all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted.
p161
aVAnd again, this is a kind of an accurate model
p162
aVof what happens with the gravitational lensing.
p163
aa(lp164
VOK, so the question is: do we see this in the sky?
p165
aVDo we see arcs in the sky when we look at, say, a cluster of galaxies?
p166
aVAnd the answer is yes.
p167
aVAnd so, here's an image from the Hubble Space Telescope.
p168
aVMany of the images you are seeing
p169
aVare earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope.
p170
aVWell, first of all, for the golden shape galaxies \u2014
p171
aVthose are the galaxies in the cluster.
p172
aVThey're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter
p173
aVthat are causing the bending of the light
p174
aVto cause these optical illusions, or mirages, practically,
p175
aVof the background galaxies.
p176
aVSo the streaks that you see, all these streaks,
p177
aVare actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo what we can do, then, is based on how much distortion
p180
aVwe see in those images, we can calculate how much mass
p181
aVthere must be in this cluster.
p182
aVAnd it's an enormous amount of mass.
p183
aVAnd also, you can tell by eye, by looking at this,
p184
aVthat these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies.
p185
aVThey are centered on some more spread out structure,
p186
aVand that is the dark matter
p187
aVin which the cluster is embedded, OK.
p188
aVSo this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing
p189
aVat least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye.
p190
aa(lp191
VOK, so, a quick review then, to see that you're following.
p192
aVSo the evidence that we have
p193
aVthat a quarter of the universe is dark matter \u2014
p194
aVthis gravitationally attracting stuff \u2014
p195
aVis that galaxies, the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies
p196
aVis much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter.
p197
aVThe speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large;
p198
aVit must be embedded in dark matter.
p199
aVAnd we see these gravitational lensing effects, these distortions
p200
aVthat say that, again, clusters are embedded in dark matter.
p201
aa(lp202
VOK. So now, let's turn to dark energy.
p203
aVSo to understand the evidence for dark energy, we need to discuss something
p204
aVthat Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session.
p205
aVAnd that is the fact that space itself is expanding.
p206
aVSo if we imagine a section of our infinite universe \u2014
p207
aVand so I've put down four spiral galaxies, OK \u2014
p208
aVand imagine that you put down a set of tape measures,
p209
aVso every line on here corresponds to a tape measure,
p210
aVhorizontal or vertical, for measuring where things are.
p211
aVIf you could do this, what you would find
p212
aVthat with each passing day, each passing year,
p213
aVeach passing billions of years, OK,
p214
aVthe distance between galaxies is getting greater.
p215
aVAnd it's not because galaxies are moving
p216
aVaway from each other through space.
p217
aVThey're not necessarily moving through space.
p218
aVThey're moving away from each other
p219
aVbecause space itself is getting bigger, OK.
p220
aVThat's what the expansion of the universe or space means.
p221
aVSo they're moving further apart.
p222
aa(lp223
VNow, what Stephen Hawking mentioned, as well,
p224
aVis that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate.
p225
aVBut because gravitationally attracting matter
p226
aVis embedded in this space,
p227
aVit tends to slow down the expansion of the space, OK.
p228
aVSo the expansion slows down with time.
p229
aVSo, in the last century, OK, people debated
p230
aVabout whether this expansion of space would continue forever;
p231
aVwhether it would slow down, you know,
p232
aVwill be slowing down, but continue forever;
p233
aVslow down and stop, asymptotically stop;
p234
aVor slow down, stop, and then reverse, so it starts to contract again.
p235
aVSo a little over a decade ago,
p236
aVtwo groups of physicists and astronomers
p237
aVset out to measure the rate at which
p238
aVthe expansion of space was slowing down, OK.
p239
aVBy how much less is it expanding today,
p240
aVcompared to, say, a couple of billion years ago?
p241
aa(lp242
VThe startling answer to this question, OK, from these experiments,
p243
aVwas that space is expanding at a faster rate today
p244
aVthan it was a few billion years ago, OK.
p245
aVSo the expansion of space is actually speeding up.
p246
aVThis was a completely surprising result.
p247
aVThere is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen, OK.
p248
aVNo one was predicting ahead of time this is what's going to be found.
p249
aVIt was the opposite of what was expected.
p250
aVSo we need something to be able to explain that.
p251
aVNow it turns out, in the mathematics,
p252
aVyou can put it in as a term that's an energy,
p253
aVbut it's a completely different type of energy
p254
aVfrom anything we've ever seen before.
p255
aVWe call it dark energy,
p256
aVand it has this effect of causing space to expand.
p257
aVBut we don't have a good motivation
p258
aVfor putting it in there at this point, OK.
p259
aVSo it's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in.
p260
aa(lp261
VNow, so at this point, then, what I want to really emphasize to you,
p262
aVis that, first of all, dark matter and dark energy
p263
aVare completely different things, OK.
p264
aVThere are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe,
p265
aVand they have very different effects.
p266
aVDark matter, because it gravitationally attracts,
p267
aVit tends to encourage the growth of structure, OK.
p268
aVSo clusters of galaxies will tend to form,
p269
aVbecause of all this gravitational attraction.
p270
aVDark energy, on the other hand,
p271
aVis putting more and more space between the galaxies,
p272
aVmakes it, the gravitational attraction between them decrease,
p273
aVand so it impedes the growth of structure.
p274
aVSo by looking at things like clusters of galaxies,
p275
aVand how they \u2014 their number density,
p276
aVhow many there are as a function of time \u2014
p277
aVwe can learn about how dark matter and dark energy
p278
aVcompete against each other in structure forming.
p279
aa(lp280
VIn terms of dark matter, I said that we don't have any,
p281
aVyou know, really persuasive argument for dark energy.
p282
aVDo we have anything for dark matter? And the answer is yes.
p283
aVWe have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter.
p284
aVNow, what do I mean by well motivated?
p285
aVI mean that we have mathematically consistent theories
p286
aVthat were actually introduced
p287
aVto explain a completely different phenomenon, OK,
p288
aVthings that I haven't even talked about,
p289
aVthat each predict the existence
p290
aVof a very weakly interacting, new particle.
p291
aa(lp292
VSo, this is exactly what you want in physics:
p293
aVwhere a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory
p294
aVthat was actually developed for something else.
p295
aVBut we don't know if either of those
p296
aVare actually the dark matter candidate, OK.
p297
aVOne or both, who knows? Or it could be something completely different.
p298
aVNow, we look for these dark matter particles
p299
aVbecause, after all, they are here in the room, OK,
p300
aVand they didn't come in the door.
p301
aVThey just pass through anything.
p302
aVThey can come through the building, through the Earth \u2014
p303
aVthey're so non-interacting.
p304
aa(lp305
VSo one way to look for them is to build detectors
p306
aVthat are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it.
p307
aVSo a crystal that will ring if that happens.
p308
aVSo one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators
p309
aVhave built such a detector.
p310
aVAnd they've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota,
p311
aVOK, deep under the ground, and in fact, in the last couple of days
p312
aVannounced the most sensitive results so far.
p313
aVThey haven't seen anything, OK, but it puts limits on what the mass
p314
aVand the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are.
p315
aVThere's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year
p316
aVand it will look towards the middle of the galaxy,
p317
aVto see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating
p318
aVand producing gamma rays that could be detected with this.
p319
aVThe Large Hadron Collider, a particle physics accelerator,
p320
aVthat we'll be turning on later this year.
p321
aVIt is possible that dark matter particles might be produced
p322
aVat the Large Hadron Collider.
p323
aa(lp324
VNow, because they are so non-interactive,
p325
aVthey will actually escape the detector,
p326
aVso their signature will be missing energy, OK.
p327
aVNow, unfortunately, there is a lot of new physics
p328
aVwhose signature could be missing energy,
p329
aVso it will be hard to tell the difference.
p330
aVAnd finally, for future endeavors, there are telescopes being designed
p331
aVspecifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy \u2014
p332
aVground-based telescopes, and there are three space-based telescopes
p333
aVthat are in competition right now
p334
aVto be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy.
p335
aVSo in terms of the big questions:
p336
aVwhat is dark matter? What is dark energy?
p337
aVThe big questions facing physics.
p338
aVAnd I'm sure you have lots of questions,
p339
aVwhich I very much look forward to addressing
p340
aVover the next 72 hours, while I'm here. Thank you.
