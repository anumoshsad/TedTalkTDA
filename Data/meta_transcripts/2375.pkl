VFor much of the past century,
p4
aVarchitecture was under the spell of a famous doctrine.
p5
aV"Form follows function" had become modernity's ambitious manifesto
p6
aVand detrimental straitjacket,
p7
aVas it liberated architecture from the decorative,
p8
aVbut condemned it to utilitarian rigor and restrained purpose.
p9
aVOf course, architecture is about function,
p10
aVbut I want to remember a rewriting of this phrase by Bernard Tschumi,
p11
aVand I want to propose a completely different quality.
p12
aVIf form follows fiction,
p13
aVwe could think of architecture and buildings as a space of stories \u2014
p14
aVstories of the people that live there,
p15
aVof the people that work in these buildings.
p16
aVAnd we could start to imagine the experiences our buildings create.
p17
aa(lp18
VIn this sense, I'm interested in fiction
p19
aVnot as the implausible but as the real,
p20
aVas the reality of what architecture means
p21
aVfor the people that live in it and with it.
p22
aVOur buildings are prototypes, ideas for how the space of living
p23
aVor how the space of working could be different,
p24
aVand what a space of culture or a space of media could look like today.
p25
aVOur buildings are real; they're being built.
p26
aVThey're an explicit engagement in physical reality
p27
aVand conceptual possibility.
p28
aVI think of our architecture as organizational structures.
p29
aVAt their core is indeed structural thinking, like a system:
p30
aVHow can we arrange things in both a functional
p31
aVand experiential way?
p32
aVHow can we create structures that generate a series
p33
aVof relationships and narratives?
p34
aVAnd how can fictive stories
p35
aVof the inhabitants and users of our buildings
p36
aVscript the architecture,
p37
aVwhile the architecture scripts those stories at the same time?
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd here comes the second term into play,
p40
aVwhat I call "narrative hybrids" \u2014
p41
aVstructures of multiple simultaneous stories
p42
aVthat unfold throughout the buildings we create.
p43
aVSo we could think of architecture as complex systems of relationships,
p44
aVboth in a programmatic and functional way
p45
aVand in an experiential and emotive or social way.
p46
aa(lp47
VThis is the headquarters for China's national broadcaster,
p48
aVwhich I designed together with Rem Koolhaas at OMA.
p49
aVWhen I first arrived in Beijing in 2002, the city planners showed us this image:
p50
aVa forest of several hundred skyscrapers
p51
aVto emerge in the central business district,
p52
aVexcept at that time, only a handful of them existed.
p53
aVSo we had to design in a context that we knew almost nothing about,
p54
aVexcept one thing: it would all be about verticality.
p55
aa(lp56
VOf course, the skyscraper is vertical \u2014 it's a profoundly hierarchical structure,
p57
aVthe top always the best, the bottom the worst,
p58
aVand the taller you are, the better, so it seems.
p59
aVAnd we wanted to ask ourselves,
p60
aVcould a building be about a completely different quality?
p61
aVCould it undo this hierarchy, and could it be about a system
p62
aVthat is more about collaboration, rather than isolation?
p63
aVSo we took this needle and bent it back into itself,
p64
aVinto a loop of interconnected activities.
p65
aVOur idea was to bring all aspects of television-making
p66
aVinto one single structure: news, program production, broadcasting,
p67
aVresearch and training, administration \u2014
p68
aVall into a circuit of interconnected activities
p69
aVwhere people would meet in a process of exchange and collaboration.
p70
aa(lp71
VI still very much like this image.
p72
aVIt reminds one of biology classes, if you remember the human body
p73
aVwith all its organs and circulatory systems, like at school.
p74
aVAnd suddenly you think of architecture no longer as built substance,
p75
aVbut as an organism, as a life form.
p76
aVAnd as you start to dissect this organism,
p77
aVyou can identify a series of primary technical clusters \u2014
p78
aVprogram production, broadcasting center and news.
p79
aVThose are tightly intertwined with social clusters:
p80
aVmeeting rooms, canteens, chat areas \u2014
p81
aVinformal spaces for people to meet and exchange.
p82
aVSo the organizational structure of this building was a hybrid
p83
aVbetween the technical and the social,
p84
aVthe human and the performative.
p85
aVAnd of course, we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system,
p86
aVto thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff
p87
aVto experience all these different functions in a great unity.
p88
aa(lp89
VWith 473,000 square meters,
p90
aVit is one of the largest buildings ever built in the world.
p91
aVIt has a population of over 10,000 people,
p92
aVand of course, this is a scale that exceeds the comprehension
p93
aVof many things and the scale of typical architecture.
p94
aVSo we stopped work for a while
p95
aVand sat down and cut 10,000 little sticks and glued them onto a model,
p96
aVjust simply to confront ourselves with what that quantity actually meant.
p97
aa(lp98
VBut of course, it's not a number,
p99
aVit is the people, it is a community that inhabits the building,
p100
aVand in order to both comprehend this, but also script this architecture,
p101
aVwe identified five characters, hypothetical characters,
p102
aVand we followed them throughout their day in a life in this building,
p103
aVthought of where they would meet, what they would experience.
p104
aVSo it was a way to script and design the building, but of course,
p105
aValso to communicate its experiences.
p106
aVThis was part of an exhibition with the Museum of Modern Art
p107
aVin both New York and Beijing.
p108
aa(lp109
VThis is the main broadcast control room,
p110
aVa technical installation so large,
p111
aVit can broadcast over 200 channels simultaneously.
p112
aVAnd this is how the building stands in Beijing today.
p113
aVIts first broadcast live was the London Olympics 2012,
p114
aVafter it had been completed from the outside for the Beijing Olympics.
p115
aVAnd you can see at the very tip of this 75-meter cantilever,
p116
aVthose three little circles.
p117
aVAnd they're indeed part of a public loop that goes through the building.
p118
aVThey're a piece of glass that you can stand on
p119
aVand watch the city pass by below you in slow motion.
p120
aa(lp121
VThe building has become part of everyday life in Beijing.
p122
aVIt is there.
p123
aVIt has also become a very popular backdrop
p124
aVfor wedding photography.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VBut its most important moment is maybe sill this one.
p129
aV"That's Beijing" is similar to "Time Out,"
p130
aVa magazine that broadcasts what is happening in town during the week,
p131
aVand suddenly you see the building portrayed no longer as physical matter,
p132
aVbut actually as an urban actor,
p133
aVas part of a series of personas that define the life of the city.
p134
aVSo architecture suddenly assumes the quality of a player,
p135
aVof something that writes stories and performs stories.
p136
aVAnd I think that could be one of its primary meanings
p137
aVthat we believe in.
p138
aa(lp139
VBut of course, there's another story to this building.
p140
aVIt is the story of the people that made it \u2014
p141
aV400 engineers and architects that I was guiding
p142
aVover almost a decade of collaborative work
p143
aVthat we spent together in scripting this building,
p144
aVin imagining its reality
p145
aVand ultimately getting it built in China.
p146
aa(lp147
VThis is a residential development in Singapore, large scale.
p148
aVIf we look at Singapore like most of Asia and more and more of the world,
p149
aVof course, it is dominated by the tower,
p150
aVa typology that indeed creates more isolation than connectedness,
p151
aVand I wanted to ask, how could we think about living,
p152
aVnot only in terms of the privacy and individuality of ourselves
p153
aVand our apartment,
p154
aVbut in an idea of a collective?
p155
aVHow could we think about creating a communal environment
p156
aVin which sharing things was as great as having your own?
p157
aa(lp158
VThe typical answer to the question \u2014 we had to design 1,040 apartments \u2014
p159
aVwould have looked like this:
p160
aV24-story height limit given by the planning authorities,
p161
aV12 towers with nothing but residual in between \u2014
p162
aVa very tight system that, although the tower isolates you,
p163
aVit doesn't even give you privacy, because you're so close to the next one,
p164
aVthat it is very questionable what the qualities of this would be.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo I proposed to topple the towers, throw the vertical into the horizontal
p167
aVand stack them up,
p168
aVand what looks a bit random from the side,
p169
aVif you look from the viewpoint of the helicopter,
p170
aVyou can see its organizational structure is actually a hexagonal grid,
p171
aVin which these horizontal building blocks are stacked up
p172
aVto create huge outdoor courtyards \u2014 central spaces for the community,
p173
aVprogrammed with a variety of amenities and functions.
p174
aVAnd you see that these courtyards are not hermetically sealed spaces.
p175
aVThey're open, permeable; they're interconnected.
p176
aVWe called the project "The Interlace,"
p177
aVthinking that we interlace and interconnect
p178
aVthe human beings and the spaces alike.
p179
aVAnd the detailed quality of everything we designed
p180
aVwas about animating the space and giving the space to the inhabitants.
p181
aVAnd, in fact, it was a system
p182
aVwhere we would layer primarily communal spaces,
p183
aVstacked to more and more individual and private spaces.
p184
aVSo we would open up a spectrum
p185
aVbetween the collective and the individual.
p186
aa(lp187
VA little piece of math:
p188
aVif we count all the green that we left on the ground,
p189
aVminus the footprint of the buildings,
p190
aVand we would add back the green of all the terraces,
p191
aVwe have 112 percent green space,
p192
aVso more nature than not having built a building.
p193
aVAnd of course this little piece of math shows you that we are multiplying
p194
aVthe space available to those who live there.
p195
aVThis is, in fact, the 13th floor of one of these terraces.
p196
aVSo you see new datum planes, new grounds planes for social activity.
p197
aa(lp198
VWe paid a lot of attention to sustainability.
p199
aVIn the tropics, the sun is the most important thing to pay attention to,
p200
aVand, in fact, it is seeking protection from the sun.
p201
aVWe first proved that all apartments would have sufficient daylight
p202
aVthrough the year.
p203
aVWe then went on to optimize the glazing of the facades
p204
aVto minimize the energy consumption of the building.
p205
aVBut most importantly, we could prove that through the geometry
p206
aVof the building design,
p207
aVthe building itself would provide sufficient shading to the courtyards
p208
aVso that those would be usable throughout the entire year.
p209
aVWe further placed water bodies along the prevailing wind corridors,
p210
aVso that evaporative cooling would create microclimates
p211
aVthat, again, would enhance the quality of those spaces
p212
aVavailable for the inhabitants.
p213
aVAnd it was the idea of creating this variety of choices,
p214
aVof freedom to think where you would want to be,
p215
aVwhere you would want to escape, maybe,
p216
aVwithin the own complexity of the complex in which you live.
p217
aa(lp218
VBut coming from Asia to Europe:
p219
aVa building for a German media company based in Berlin,
p220
aVtransitioning from the traditional print media to the digital media.
p221
aVAnd its CEO asked a few very pertinent questions:
p222
aVWhy would anyone today still want to go to the office,
p223
aVbecause you can actually work anywhere?
p224
aVAnd how could a digital identity of a company be embodied
p225
aVin a building?
p226
aVWe created not only an object, but at the center of this object
p227
aVwe created a giant space,
p228
aVand this space was about the experience of a collective,
p229
aVthe experience of collaboration and of togetherness.
p230
aVCommunication, interaction as the center of a space
p231
aVthat in itself would float,
p232
aVlike what we call the collaborative cloud,
p233
aVin the middle of the building,
p234
aVsurrounded by an envelope of standard modular offices.
p235
aVSo with only a few steps from your quiet work desk,
p236
aVyou could participate in the giant collective experience
p237
aVof the central space.
p238
aa(lp239
VFinally, we come to London, a project commissioned
p240
aVby the London Legacy Development Corporation
p241
aVof the Mayor of London.
p242
aVWe were asked to undertake a study
p243
aVand investigate the potential of a site
p244
aVout in Stratford in the Olympic Park.
p245
aVIn the 19th century, Prince Albert had created Albertopolis.
p246
aVAnd Boris Johnson thought of creating Olympicopolis.
p247
aa(lp248
VThe idea was to bring together some of Britain's greatest institutions,
p249
aVsome international ones, and to create a new system of synergies.
p250
aVPrince Albert, as yet, created Albertopolis in the 19th century,
p251
aVthought of showcasing all achievements of mankind,
p252
aVbringing arts and science closer together.
p253
aVAnd he built Exhibition Road, a linear sequence of those institutions.
p254
aa(lp255
VBut of course, today's society has moved on from there.
p256
aVWe no longer live in a world
p257
aVin which everything is as clearly delineated
p258
aVor separated from each other.
p259
aVWe live in a world in which boundaries start to blur
p260
aVbetween the different domains,
p261
aVand in which collaboration and interaction becomes far more important
p262
aVthan keeping separations.
p263
aVSo we wanted to think of a giant culture machine,
p264
aVa building that would orchestrate and animate the various domains,
p265
aVbut allow them to interact and collaborate.
p266
aVAt the base of it is a very simple module,
p267
aVa ring module.
p268
aVIt can function as a double-loaded corridor, has daylight, has ventilation.
p269
aVIt can be glazed over
p270
aVand turned into a giant exhibitional performance space.
p271
aVThese modules were stacked together
p272
aVwith the idea that almost any function could, over time,
p273
aVoccupy any of these modules.
p274
aVSo institutions could shrink or contract,
p275
aVas, of course, the future of culture is, in a way, the most uncertain of all.
p276
aVThis is how the building sits, adjacent to the Aquatics Centre,
p277
aVopposite the Olympic Stadium.
p278
aVAnd you can see how its cantilevering volumes
p279
aVproject out and engage the public space
p280
aVand how its courtyards animate the public inside.
p281
aa(lp282
VThe idea was to create a complex system
p283
aVin which institutional entities could maintain their own identity,
p284
aVin which they would not be subsumed in a singular volume.
p285
aVHere's a scale comparison to the Centre Pompidou in Paris.
p286
aVIt both shows the enormous scale and potential of the project,
p287
aVbut also the difference:
p288
aVhere, it is a multiplicity of a heterogeneous structure,
p289
aVin which different entities can interact
p290
aVwithout losing their own identity.
p291
aVAnd it was this thought: to create an organizational structure
p292
aVthat would allow for multiple narratives to be scripted \u2014
p293
aVfor those in the educational parts that create and think culture;
p294
aVfor those that present the visual arts, the dance;
p295
aVand for the public to be admitted into all of this
p296
aVwith a series of possible trajectories,
p297
aVto script their own reading of these narratives
p298
aVand their own experience.
p299
aa(lp300
VAnd I want to end on a project that is very small,
p301
aVin a way, very different:
p302
aVa floating cinema in the ocean of Thailand.
p303
aVFriends of mine had founded a film festival,
p304
aVand I thought,
p305
aVif we think of the stories and narratives of movies,
p306
aVwe should also think of the narratives of the people that watch them.
p307
aVSo I designed a small modular floating platform,
p308
aVbased on the techniques of local fishermen,
p309
aVhow they built their lobster and fish farms.
p310
aVWe collaborated with the local community
p311
aVand built, out of recycled materials of their own,
p312
aVthis fantastical floating platform
p313
aVthat gently moved in the ocean
p314
aVas we watched films from the British film archive,
p315
aV[1903] "Alice in Wonderland," for example.
p316
aVThe most primordial experiences of the audience
p317
aVmerged with the stories of the movies.
p318
aa(lp319
VSo I believe that architecture exceeds the domain of physical matter,
p320
aVof the built environment,
p321
aVbut is really about how we want to live our lives,
p322
aVhow we script our own stories and those of others.
p323

VThank you.
