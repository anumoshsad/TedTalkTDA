VThere is something about physics
p4
aVthat has been really bothering me since I was a little kid.
p5
aVAnd it's related to a question
p6
aVthat scientists have been asking for almost 100 years,
p7
aVwith no answer.
p8
aVHow do the smallest things in nature,
p9
aVthe particles of the quantum world,
p10
aVmatch up with the largest things in nature \u2014
p11
aVplanets and stars and galaxies held together by gravity?
p12
aa(lp13
VAs a kid, I would puzzle over questions just like this.
p14
aVI would fiddle around with microscopes and electromagnets,
p15
aVand I would read about the forces of the small
p16
aVand about quantum mechanics
p17
aVand I would marvel at how well that description matched up
p18
aVto our observation.
p19
aVThen I would look at the stars,
p20
aVand I would read about how well we understand gravity,
p21
aVand I would think surely, there must be some elegant way
p22
aVthat these two systems match up.
p23
aVBut there's not.
p24
aVAnd the books would say,
p25
aVyeah, we understand a lot about these two realms separately,
p26
aVbut when we try to link them mathematically,
p27
aVeverything breaks.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd for 100 years,
p30
aVnone of our ideas as to how to solve this basically physics disaster,
p31
aVhas ever been supported by evidence.
p32
aVAnd to little old me \u2014
p33
aVlittle, curious, skeptical James \u2014
p34
aVthis was a supremely unsatisfying answer.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo, I'm still a skeptical little kid.
p37
aVFlash-forward now to December of 2015,
p38
aVwhen I found myself smack in the middle
p39
aVof the physics world being flipped on its head.
p40
aVIt all started when we at CERN saw something intriguing in our data:
p41
aVa hint of a new particle,
p42
aVan inkling of a possibly extraordinary answer to this question.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo I'm still a skeptical little kid, I think,
p45
aVbut I'm also now a particle hunter.
p46
aVI am a physicist at CERN's Large Hadron Collider,
p47
aVthe largest science experiment ever mounted.
p48
aVIt's a 27-kilometer tunnel on the border of France and Switzerland
p49
aVburied 100 meters underground.
p50
aVAnd in this tunnel,
p51
aVwe use superconducting magnets colder than outer space
p52
aVto accelerate protons to almost the speed of light
p53
aVand slam them into each other millions of times per second,
p54
aVcollecting the debris of these collisions
p55
aVto search for new, undiscovered fundamental particles.
p56
aVIts design and construction took decades of work
p57
aVby thousands of physicists from around the globe,
p58
aVand in the summer of 2015,
p59
aVwe had been working tirelessly to switch on the LHC
p60
aVat the highest energy that humans have ever used in a collider experiment.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, higher energy is important
p63
aVbecause for particles, there is an equivalence
p64
aVbetween energy and particle mass,
p65
aVand mass is just a number put there by nature.
p66
aVTo discover new particles,
p67
aVwe need to reach these bigger numbers.
p68
aVAnd to do that, we have to build a bigger, higher energy collider,
p69
aVand the biggest, highest energy collider in the world
p70
aVis the Large Hadron Collider.
p71
aVAnd then, we collide protons quadrillions of times,
p72
aVand we collect this data very slowly, over months and months.
p73
aVAnd then new particles might show up in our data as bumps \u2014
p74
aVslight deviations from what you expect,
p75
aVlittle clusters of data points that make a smooth line not so smooth.
p76
aVFor example, this bump,
p77
aVafter months of data-taking in 2012,
p78
aVled to the discovery of the Higgs particle \u2014
p79
aVthe Higgs boson \u2014
p80
aVand to a Nobel Prize for the confirmation of its existence.
p81
aa(lp82
VThis jump up in energy in 2015
p83
aVrepresented the best chance that we as a species had ever had
p84
aVof discovering new particles \u2014
p85
aVnew answers to these long-standing questions,
p86
aVbecause it was almost twice as much energy as we used
p87
aVwhen we discovered the Higgs boson.
p88
aVMany of my colleagues had been working their entire careers for this moment,
p89
aVand frankly, to little curious me,
p90
aVthis was the moment I'd been waiting for my entire life.
p91
aVSo 2015 was go time.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo June 2015,
p94
aVthe LHC is switched back on.
p95
aVMy colleagues and I held our breath and bit our fingernails,
p96
aVand then finally we saw the first proton collisions
p97
aVat this highest energy ever.
p98
aVApplause, champagne, celebration.
p99
aVThis was a milestone for science,
p100
aVand we had no idea what we would find in this brand-new data.
p101
aVAnd then a few weeks later, we found a bump.
p102
aVIt wasn't a very big bump,
p103
aVbut it was big enough to make you raise your eyebrow.
p104
aVBut on a scale of one to 10 for eyebrow raises,
p105
aVif 10 indicates that you've discovered a new particle,
p106
aVthis eyebrow raise is about a four.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VI spent hours, days, weeks in secret meetings,
p111
aVarguing with my colleagues over this little bump,
p112
aVpoking and prodding it with our most ruthless experimental sticks
p113
aVto see if it would withstand scrutiny.
p114
aVBut even after months of working feverishly \u2014
p115
aVsleeping in our offices and not going home,
p116
aVcandy bars for dinner,
p117
aVcoffee by the bucketful \u2014
p118
aVphysicists are machines for turning coffee into diagrams \u2014
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VThis little bump would not go away.
p123
aVSo after a few months,
p124
aVwe presented our little bump to the world with a very clear message:
p125
aVthis little bump is interesting but it's not definitive,
p126
aVso let's keep an eye on it as we take more data.
p127
aVSo we were trying to be extremely cool about it.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd the world ran with it anyway.
p130
aVThe news loved it.
p131
aVPeople said it reminded them of the little bump
p132
aVthat was shown on the way toward the Higgs boson discovery.
p133
aVBetter than that, my theorist colleagues \u2014
p134
aVI love my theorist colleagues \u2014
p135
aVmy theorist colleagues wrote 500 papers about this little bump.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VThe world of particle physics had been flipped on its head.
p140
aVBut what was it about this particular bump
p141
aVthat caused thousands of physicists to collectively lose their cool?
p142
aVThis little bump was unique.
p143
aVThis little bump indicated
p144
aVthat we were seeing an unexpectedly large number of collisions
p145
aVwhose debris consisted of only two photons,
p146
aVtwo particles of light.
p147
aVAnd that's rare.
p148
aa(lp149
VParticle collisions are not like automobile collisions.
p150
aVThey have different rules.
p151
aVWhen two particles collide at almost the speed of light,
p152
aVthe quantum world takes over.
p153
aVAnd in the quantum world,
p154
aVthese two particles can briefly create a new particle
p155
aVthat lives for a tiny fraction of a second
p156
aVbefore splitting into other particles that hit our detector.
p157
aVImagine a car collision where the two cars vanish upon impact,
p158
aVa bicycle appears in their place \u2014
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd then that bicycle explodes into two skateboards,
p163
aVwhich hit our detector.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VHopefully, not literally.
p168
aVThey're very expensive.
p169
aa(lp170
VEvents where only two photons hit out detector are very rare.
p171
aVAnd because of the special quantum properties of photons,
p172
aVthere's a very small number of possible new particles \u2014
p173
aVthese mythical bicycles \u2014
p174
aVthat can give birth to only two photons.
p175
aVBut one of these options is huge,
p176
aVand it has to do with that long-standing question
p177
aVthat bothered me as a tiny little kid,
p178
aVabout gravity.
p179
aa(lp180
VGravity may seem super strong to you,
p181
aVbut it's actually crazily weak compared to the other forces of nature.
p182
aVI can briefly beat gravity when I jump,
p183
aVbut I can't pick a proton out of my hand.
p184
aVThe strength of gravity compared to the other forces of nature?
p185
aVIt's 10 to the minus 39.
p186
aVThat's a decimal with 39 zeros after it.
p187
aa(lp188
VWorse than that,
p189
aVall of the other known forces of nature are perfectly described
p190
aVby this thing we call the Standard Model,
p191
aVwhich is our current best description of nature at its smallest scales,
p192
aVand quite frankly,
p193
aVone of the most successful achievements of humankind \u2014
p194
aVexcept for gravity, which is absent from the Standard Model.
p195
aVIt's crazy.
p196
aVIt's almost as though most of gravity has gone missing.
p197
aVWe feel a little bit of it,
p198
aVbut where's the rest of it?
p199
aVNo one knows.
p200
aa(lp201
VBut one theoretical explanation proposes a wild solution.
p202
aVYou and I \u2014
p203
aVeven you in the back \u2014
p204
aVwe live in three dimensions of space.
p205
aVI hope that's a non-controversial statement.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VAll of the known particles also live in three dimensions of space.
p210
aVIn fact, a particle is just another name
p211
aVfor an excitation in a three-dimensional field;
p212
aVa localized wobbling in space.
p213
aVMore importantly, all the math that we use to describe all this stuff
p214
aVassumes that there are only three dimensions of space.
p215
aVBut math is math, and we can play around with our math however we want.
p216
aVAnd people have been playing around with extra dimensions of space
p217
aVfor a very long time,
p218
aVbut it's always been an abstract mathematical concept.
p219
aVI mean, just look around you \u2014 you at the back, look around \u2014
p220
aVthere's clearly only three dimensions of space.
p221
aa(lp222
VBut what if that's not true?
p223
aVWhat if the missing gravity is leaking into an extra-spatial dimension
p224
aVthat's invisible to you and I?
p225
aVWhat if gravity is just as strong as the other forces
p226
aVif you were to view it in this extra-spatial dimension,
p227
aVand what you and I experience is a tiny slice of gravity
p228
aVmake it seem very weak?
p229
aVIf this were true,
p230
aVwe would have to expand our Standard Model of particles
p231
aVto include an extra particle, a hyperdimensional particle of gravity,
p232
aVa special graviton that lives in extra-spatial dimensions.
p233
aa(lp234
VI see the looks on your faces.
p235
aVYou should be asking me the question,
p236
aV"How in the world are we going to test this crazy, science fiction idea,
p237
aVstuck as we are in three dimensions?"
p238
aVThe way we always do,
p239
aVby slamming together two protons \u2014
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VHard enough that the collision reverberates
p244
aVinto any extra-spatial dimensions that might be there,
p245
aVmomentarily creating this hyperdimensional graviton
p246
aVthat then snaps back into the three dimensions of the LHC
p247
aVand spits off two photons,
p248
aVtwo particles of light.
p249
aVAnd this hypothetical, extra-dimensional graviton
p250
aVis one of the only possible, hypothetical new particles
p251
aVthat has the special quantum properties
p252
aVthat could give birth to our little, two-photon bump.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo, the possibility of explaining the mysteries of gravity
p255
aVand of discovering extra dimensions of space \u2014
p256
aVperhaps now you get a sense
p257
aVas to why thousands of physics geeks collectively lost their cool
p258
aVover our little, two-photon bump.
p259
aVA discovery of this type would rewrite the textbooks.
p260
aVBut remember,
p261
aVthe message from us experimentalists
p262
aVthat actually were doing this work at the time,
p263
aVwas very clear:
p264
aVwe need more data.
p265
aVWith more data,
p266
aVthe little bump will either turn into a nice, crisp Nobel Prize \u2014
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VOr the extra data will fill in the space around the bump
p271
aVand turn it into a nice, smooth line.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo we took more data,
p274
aVand with five times the data, several months later,
p275
aVour little bump
p276
aVturned into a smooth line.
p277
aVThe news reported on a "huge disappointment," on "faded hopes,"
p278
aVand on particle physicists "being sad."
p279
aVGiven the tone of the coverage,
p280
aVyou'd think that we had decided to shut down the LHC and go home.
p281
aa(lp282
V(Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
VBut that's not what we did.
p285
aVBut why not?
p286
aVI mean, if I didn't discover a particle \u2014 and I didn't \u2014
p287
aVif I didn't discover a particle, why am I here talking to you?
p288
aVWhy didn't I just hang my head in shame
p289
aVand go home?
p290
aa(lp291
VParticle physicists are explorers.
p292
aVAnd very much of what we do is cartography.
p293
aVLet me put it this way: forget about the LHC for a second.
p294
aVImagine you are a space explorer arriving at a distant planet,
p295
aVsearching for aliens.
p296
aVWhat is your first task?
p297
aVTo immediately orbit the planet, land, take a quick look around
p298
aVfor any big, obvious signs of life,
p299
aVand report back to home base.
p300
aVThat's the stage we're at now.
p301
aVWe took a first look at the LHC
p302
aVfor any new, big, obvious-to-spot particles,
p303
aVand we can report that there are none.
p304
aVWe saw a weird-looking alien bump on a distant mountain,
p305
aVbut once we got closer, we saw it was a rock.
p306
aa(lp307
VBut then what do we do? Do we just give up and fly away?
p308
aVAbsolutely not;
p309
aVwe would be terrible scientists if we did.
p310
aVNo, we spend the next couple of decades exploring,
p311
aVmapping out the territory,
p312
aVsifting through the sand with a fine instrument,
p313
aVpeeking under every stone,
p314
aVdrilling under the surface.
p315
aVNew particles can either show up immediately
p316
aVas big, obvious-to-spot bumps,
p317
aVor they can only reveal themselves after years of data taking.
p318
aa(lp319
VHumanity has just begun its exploration at the LHC at this big high energy,
p320
aVand we have much searching to do.
p321
aVBut what if, even after 10 or 20 years, we still find no new particles?
p322
aVWe build a bigger machine.
p323
aa(lp324
V(Laughter)
p325
aa(lp326
VWe search at higher energies.
p327
aVWe search at higher energies.
p328
aVPlanning is already underway for a 100-kilometer tunnel
p329
aVthat will collide particles at 10 times the energy of the LHC.
p330
aVWe don't decide where nature places new particles.
p331
aVWe only decide to keep exploring.
p332
aVBut what if, even after a 100-kilometer tunnel
p333
aVor a 500-kilometer tunnel
p334
aVor a 10,000-kilometer collider floating in space
p335
aVbetween the Earth and the Moon,
p336
aVwe still find no new particles?
p337
aVThen perhaps we're doing particle physics wrong.
p338
aa(lp339
V(Laughter)
p340
aa(lp341
VPerhaps we need to rethink things.
p342
aVMaybe we need more resources, technology, expertise
p343
aVthan what we currently have.
p344
aVWe already use artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques
p345
aVin parts of the LHC,
p346
aVbut imagine designing a particle physics experiment
p347
aVusing such sophisticated algorithms
p348
aVthat it could teach itself to discover a hyperdimensional graviton.
p349
aa(lp350
VBut what if?
p351
aVWhat if the ultimate question:
p352
aVWhat if even artificial intelligence can't help us answer our questions?
p353
aVWhat if these open questions, for centuries,
p354
aVare destined to be unanswered for the foreseeable future?
p355
aVWhat if the stuff that's bothered me since I was a little kid
p356
aVis destined to be unanswered in my lifetime?
p357
aVThen that ...
p358
aVwill be even more fascinating.
p359
aa(lp360
VWe will be forced to think in completely new ways.
p361
aVWe'll have to go back to our assumptions,
p362
aVand determine if there was a flaw somewhere.
p363
aVAnd we'll need to encourage more people to join us in studying science
p364
aVsince we need fresh eyes on these century-old problems.
p365
aVI don't have the answers, and I'm still searching for them.
p366
aVBut someone \u2014 maybe she's in school right now,
p367
aVmaybe she's not even born yet \u2014
p368
aVcould eventually guide us to see physics in a completely new way,
p369
aVand to point out that perhaps we're just asking the wrong questions.
p370
aVWhich would not be the end of physics,
p371
aVbut a novel beginning.
p372

VThank you.
