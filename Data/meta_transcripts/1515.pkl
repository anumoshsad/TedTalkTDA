VSo wouldn't it be amazing if our phones
p4
aVcould see the world in the same way that we do,
p5
aVas we're walking around being able
p6
aVto point a phone at anything,
p7
aVand then have it actually recognize images and objects
p8
aVlike the human brain, and then be able to pull in information
p9
aVfrom an almost infinite library of knowledge
p10
aVand experiences and ideas.
p11
aa(lp12
VWell, traditionally that was seen as science fiction,
p13
aVbut now we've moved to a world
p14
aVwhere actually this has become possible.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo the best way of explaining it is to just show it.
p17
aVWhat you can see over here is Tamara,
p18
aVwho is holding my phone that's now plugged in.
p19
aVSo let me start with this.
p20
aVWhat we have here is a painting
p21
aVof the great poet Rabbie Burns,
p22
aVand it's just a normal image,
p23
aVbut if we now switch inputs over to the phone,
p24
aVrunning our technology, you can see
p25
aVeffectively what Tamara's seeing on the screen,
p26
aVand when she points at this image,
p27
aVsomething magical happens.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter) (Bagpipes)
p30
aV(Bagpipes) (Applause)
p31
aV(Bagpipes)
p32
aVVoice: Now simmer blinks on flowery braes ...
p33
aa(lp34
VMatt Mills: Now, what's great about this is,
p35
aVthere's no trickery here.
p36
aVThere's nothing done to this image.
p37
aVAnd what's great about this is the technology's
p38
aVactually allowing the phone to start to see and understand
p39
aVmuch like how the human brain does.
p40
aVNot only that, but as I move the object around,
p41
aVit's going to track it and overlay that content seamlessly.
p42
aVAgain, the thing that's incredible about this is
p43
aVthis is how advanced these devices have become.
p44
aVAll the processing to do that was actually done
p45
aVon the device itself.
p46
aa(lp47
VNow, this has applications everywhere,
p48
aVwhether in things like art in museums, like you just saw,
p49
aVor in the world of, say, advertising, or print journalism.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo a newspaper becomes out of date as soon as it's printed.
p52
aVAnd here is this morning's newspaper,
p53
aVand we have some Wimbledon news, which is great.
p54
aVNow what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper
p55
aVand immediately get the bulletin.
p56
aa(lp57
VVoice: ... To the grass, and it's very important that you adapt
p58
aVand you, you have to be flexible, you have to be willing
p59
aVto change direction at a split second,
p60
aVand she does all that. She's won this title.
p61
aa(lp62
VMM: And that linking of the digital content
p63
aVto something that's physical is what we call an aura, and
p64
aVI'll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo, what's great about this is it isn't just a faster,
p67
aVmore convenient way to get information in the real world,
p68
aVbut there are times when actually using this medium
p69
aVallows you to be able to display information in a way
p70
aVthat was never before possible.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo what I have here is a wireless router.
p73
aVMy American colleagues have told me I've got to call it a router,
p74
aVso that everyone here understands \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p75
aVbut nonetheless, here is the device.
p76
aVSo now what I can do is, rather than getting the instructions
p77
aVfor the device online, I can simply point at it,
p78
aVthe device is recognized, and then \u2014
p79
aa(lp80
VVoice: Begin by plugging in the grey ADSL cable.
p81
aVThen connect the power. Finally, the yellow ethernet cable.
p82
aVCongratulations. You have now completed setup.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter) MM: Awesome. Thank you.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Applause)
p87
aa(lp88
VThe incredible work that made that possible was done
p89
aVhere in the U.K. by scientists at Cambridge,
p90
aVand they work in our offices,
p91
aVand I've got a lovely picture of them here.
p92
aVThey couldn't all be on stage, but we're going to
p93
aVbring their aura to the stage, so here they are.
p94
aVThey're not very animated. (Laughter)
p95
aVThis was the fourth take, I'm told. (Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VOkay. So, as we're talking about Cambridge,
p98
aVlet's now move on to technical advancements,
p99
aVbecause since we started putting this technology
p100
aVon mobile phones less than 12 months ago,
p101
aVthe speed and the processing in these devices
p102
aVhas grown at a really phenomenal rate,
p103
aVand that means that I can now take cinema-quality
p104
aV3D models and place them in the world around me,
p105
aVso I have one over here.
p106
aVTamara, would you like to jump in?
p107
aa(lp108
V(Music)
p109
aV(Dinosaur roaring) (Laughter)
p110
aVMM: I should leap in.
p111
aV(Music) (Dinosaur roaring)
p112
aV(Applause)
p113
aa(lp114
VSo then, after the fun, comes the more emotional side
p115
aVof what we do, because effectively, this technology
p116
aVallows you to see the world through someone's eyes,
p117
aVand for that person to be able to take a moment in time
p118
aVand effectively store it and tag it to something physical
p119
aVthat exists in the real world.
p120
aVWhat's great about this is, the tools to do this are free.
p121
aVThey're open, they're available to everyone within our application,
p122
aVand educators have really got on board with the classrooms.
p123
aVSo we have teachers who've tagged up textbooks,
p124
aVteachers who've tagged up school classrooms,
p125
aVand a great example of this is a school in the U.K.
p126
aVI have a picture here from a video, and we're now going to play it.
p127
aa(lp128
VTeacher: See what happens. (Children talking) Keep going.
p129
aa(lp130
VChild: TV. (Children react)
p131
aa(lp132
VChild: Oh my God.
p133
aa(lp134
VTeacher: Now move it either side. See what happens.
p135
aVMove away from it and come back to it.
p136
aa(lp137
VChild: Oh, that is so cool.
p138
aa(lp139
VTeacher: And then, have you got it again?
p140
aa(lp141
VChild: Oh my God! How did you do that?
p142
aa(lp143
VSecond child: It's magic.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter) MM: (Laughs) So, it's not magic.
p146
aVIt's available for everyone to do,
p147
aVand actually I'm going to show you how easy it is to do
p148
aVby doing one right now.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo, as sort of \u2014 I'm told it's called a stadium wave,
p151
aVso we're going to start from this side of the room
p152
aVon the count of three, and go over to here.
p153
aVTamara, are you recording?
p154
aVOkay, so are you all ready?
p155
aVOne, two, three. Go!
p156
aa(lp157
VAudience: Whooooooo!
p158
aa(lp159
VMM: Fellows are really good at that. (Laughs) (Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VOkay. Now we're going to switch back
p162
aVinto the Aurasma application,
p163
aVand what Tamara's going to do is tag that video that we just
p164
aVtook onto my badge, so that I can remember it forever.
p165
aa(lp166
VNow, we have lots of people who are doing this already,
p167
aVand we've talked a little bit about the educational side.
p168
aVOn the emotional side, we have people who've
p169
aVdone things like send postcards and Christmas cards
p170
aVback to their family with little messages on them.
p171
aVWe have people who have, for example,
p172
aVtaken the inside of the engine bay of an old car
p173
aVand tagged up different components within an engine,
p174
aVso that if you're stuck and you want to find out more,
p175
aVyou can point and discover the information.
p176
aa(lp177
VWe're all very, very familiar with the Internet.
p178
aVIn the last 20 years, it's really
p179
aVchanged the way that we live and work,
p180
aVand the way that we see the world, and what's great is,
p181
aVwe sort of think this is the next paradigm shift,
p182
aVbecause now we can literally take the content
p183
aVthat we share, we discover, and that we enjoy
p184
aVand make it a part of the world around us.
p185
aVIt's completely free to download this application.
p186
aVIf you have a good Wi-Fi connection or 3G,
p187
aVthis process is very, very quick.
p188
aa(lp189
VOh, there we are. We can save it now.
p190
aVIt's just going to do a tiny bit of processing
p191
aVto convert that image that we just took
p192
aVinto a sort of digital fingerprint,
p193
aVand the great thing is, if you're a professional user,
p194
aV\u2014 so, a newspaper \u2014 the tools are pretty much identical
p195
aVto what we've just used to create this demonstration.
p196
aVThe only difference is that you've got the ability
p197
aVto add in links and slightly more content. Are you now ready?
p198
aa(lp199
VTamara Roukaerts: We're ready to go.
p200
aa(lp201
VMM: Okay. So, I'm told we're ready, which means
p202
aVwe can now point at the image, and there you all are.
p203
aa(lp204
VMM on video: One, two, three. Go!
p205
aa(lp206
VMM: Well done. We've been Aurasma. Thank you.
