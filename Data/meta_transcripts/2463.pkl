VIt has been 128 years
p4
aVsince the last country in the world abolished slavery
p5
aVand 53 years
p6
aVsince Martin Luther King pronounced his "I Have A Dream" speech.
p7
aVBut we still live in a world
p8
aVwhere the color of our skin not only gives a first impression,
p9
aVbut a lasting one that remains.
p10
aa(lp11
VI was born in a family full of colors.
p12
aVMy father is the son of a maid
p13
aVfrom whom he inherited an intense dark chocolate tone.
p14
aVHe was adopted by those who I know as my grandparents.
p15
aVThe matriarch, my grandma,
p16
aVhas a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair.
p17
aVMy grandpa was somewhere between a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone,
p18
aVlike my uncle and my cousin.
p19
aVMy mother is a cinnamon-skin daughter of a native Brazilian,
p20
aVwith a pinch of hazel and honey,
p21
aVand a man [who is] a mix of coffee with milk,
p22
aVbut with a lot of coffee.
p23
aVShe has two sisters.
p24
aVOne in a toasted-peanut skin
p25
aVand the other,
p26
aValso adopted,
p27
aVmore on the beige side,
p28
aVlike a pancake.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VGrowing up in this family,
p33
aVcolor was never important for me.
p34
aVOutside home, however, things were different soon.
p35
aVColor had many other meanings.
p36
aa(lp37
VI remember my first drawing lessons in school
p38
aVas a bunch of contradictory feelings.
p39
aVIt was exciting and creative
p40
aVbut I never understood the unique flesh-colored pencil.
p41
aVI was made of flesh but I wasn't pink.
p42
aVMy skin was brown, and people said I was black.
p43
aVI was seven years old with a mess of colors in my head.
p44
aa(lp45
VLater,
p46
aVwhen I took my cousin to school,
p47
aVI was usually taken for the nanny.
p48
aVBy helping in the kitchen at a friend's party,
p49
aVpeople thought I was the maid.
p50
aVI was even treated like a prostitute
p51
aVjust because I was walking alone on the beach with European friends.
p52
aVAnd many times,
p53
aVvisiting my grandma or friends in upper class buildings,
p54
aVI was invited not to use the main elevator.
p55
aVBecause in the end,
p56
aVwith this color and this hair,
p57
aVI cannot belong to some places.
p58
aa(lp59
VIn some way,
p60
aVI get to used to it and accept part of it.
p61
aVHowever, something inside of me keeps revolving and struggling.
p62
aa(lp63
VYears later I married a Spaniard.
p64
aVBut not any Spaniard.
p65
aVI chose one with the skin color of a lobster when sunburnt.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VSince then, a new question started to chase me.
p70
aVWhat will be the color of your children?
p71
aVAs you can understand, this is my last concern.
p72
aVBut thinking about it,
p73
aVwith my previous background,
p74
aVmy story led me to make my personal exercise as a photographer.
p75
aVAnd that is how Humanae was born.
p76
aa(lp77
VHumanae is a pursuit to highlight our true colors,
p78
aVrather than the untrue
p79
aVwhite, red, black or yellow associated with race.
p80
aVIt's a kind of game to question our codes.
p81
aVIt's a work in progress from a personal story to a global history.
p82
aa(lp83
VI portray the subjects in a white background.
p84
aVThen I choose an 11-pixel square from the nose,
p85
aVpaint the background,
p86
aVand look for the corresponding color in the industrial palette, Pantone.
p87
aa(lp88
VI started with my family and friends,
p89
aVthen more and more people joined the adventure,
p90
aVthanks to public calls coming through the social media.
p91
aa(lp92
VI thought that the main space to show my work was the Internet
p93
aVbecause I want an open concept that invites everybody
p94
aVto push the share button in both the computer and their brain.
p95
aa(lp96
VThe snowball started to roll.
p97
aVThe project had a great welcome \u2014
p98
aVinvitations, exhibitions,
p99
aVphysical formats,
p100
aVgalleries and museums ...
p101
aVjust happened.
p102
aVAnd among them, my favorite:
p103
aVwhen Humanae occupies public spaces
p104
aVand appears in the street,
p105
aVit fosters a popular debate
p106
aVand creates a feeling of community.
p107
aa(lp108
VI have portrayed more than 3,000 people
p109
aVin 13 different countries,
p110
aV19 different cities around the world.
p111
aVJust to mention some of them \u2014
p112
aVfrom someone included in the Forbes list,
p113
aVto refugees who crossed the Mediterranean by boat.
p114
aVIn Paris, from the UNESCO Headquarters to a shelter.
p115
aVAnd students both in Switzerland and favelas in Rio de Janeiro.
p116
aa(lp117
VAll kinds of beliefs,
p118
aVgender identities
p119
aVor physical impairments,
p120
aVa newborn or terminally ill.
p121
aVWe all together build Humanae.
p122
aa(lp123
VThose portraits make us rethink how we see each other.
p124
aVWhen modern science is questioning the race concept,
p125
aVwhat does it mean for us to be black, white, yellow, red?
p126
aVIs it the eye, the nose, the mouth, the hair?
p127
aVOr does it have to do with our origin,
p128
aVnationality
p129
aVor bank account?
p130
aa(lp131
VThis personal exercise turned out to be a discovery.
p132
aVSuddenly I realized that Humanae was useful for many people.
p133
aVIt represents a sort of mirror
p134
aVfor those who cannot find themselves reflected in any label.
p135
aa(lp136
VIt was amazing
p137
aVthat people started to share their thoughts about the work with me.
p138
aVI have hundreds of that,
p139
aVI will share with you, too.
p140
aa(lp141
VA mother of 11 years \u2014
p142
aVA mother of an 11-year-old girl wrote me,
p143
aV"Very good for me as a tool to work on her confidence,
p144
aVas this past weekend
p145
aVone of her girlfriends argued with her that she does not belong
p146
aVand should not be allowed to live in Norway.
p147
aVSo your work has a very special place in my heart
p148
aVand it's very important for me."
p149
aa(lp150
VA woman shared her portrait on Facebook and wrote,
p151
aV"All my life,
p152
aVpeople from across the globe had difficulties to place me in a group,
p153
aVa stereotype,
p154
aVa box.
p155
aVPerhaps we should stop.
p156
aVInstead of framing, ask the individual,
p157
aV'How would you label yourself?'
p158
aVThen I would say,
p159
aV'Hi. I'm Massiel.
p160
aVI'm a Dominican-Dutch,
p161
aVI grew up in a mixed family
p162
aVand I'm a bisexual woman.' "
p163
aa(lp164
VBesides these unexpected and touching reactions,
p165
aVHumanae finds a new life in a different variety of fields.
p166
aVJust to show you some examples,
p167
aVillustrators and art students
p168
aVusing it as a reference for their sketches and their studies.
p169
aVIt's a collection of faces.
p170
aa(lp171
VResearchers in the fields of anthropology,
p172
aVphysics and neuroscience
p173
aVuse Humanae with different scientific approaches
p174
aVrelated to human ethnicity,
p175
aVoptophysiology,
p176
aVface recognition
p177
aVor Alzheimer's.
p178
aa(lp179
VOne of the most important impacts of the project
p180
aVis that Humanae was chosen to be the cover of Foreign Affairs,
p181
aVone of the most relevant political publications.
p182
aVAnd talking about foreign affairs,
p183
aVI found the perfect ambassadors for my project ...
p184
aVteachers.
p185
aVThey are the ones that use Humanae as a tool for educational purposes.
p186
aVTheir passion encourages me to go back to drawing classes,
p187
aVbut this time as a teacher myself.
p188
aa(lp189
VMy students,
p190
aVboth adults and kids,
p191
aVpaint their self-portraits,
p192
aVtrying to discover their own unique color.
p193
aa(lp194
VAs a photographer,
p195
aVI realize that I can be a channel for others to communicate.
p196
aVAs an individual,
p197
aVas Angélica,
p198
aVevery time I take a picture,
p199
aVI feel that I am sitting in front of a therapist.
p200
aVAll the frustration, fear and loneliness
p201
aVthat I once felt ...
p202
aVbecomes love.
p203
aa(lp204
VThe last country \u2014
p205
aVthe last country in the world who abolished slavery
p206
aVis the country where I was born,
p207
aVBrazil.
p208
aVWe still have to work hard to abolish discrimination.
p209
aVThat remains a common practice worldwide,
p210
aVand that will not disappear by itself.
p211
aa(lp212
VThank you.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Applause)
p215
aa(lp216
VThank you.
