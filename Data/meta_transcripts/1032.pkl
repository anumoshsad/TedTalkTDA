VNow I'm going to give you a story.
p4
aVIt's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey.
p5
aVLet me begin with my parents.
p6
aVI'm a product of this
p7
aVvisionary mother and father.
p8
aVMany years ago, when I was born in the '50s \u2014
p9
aV'50s and '60s
p10
aVdidn't belong to girls in India.
p11
aVThey belonged to boys.
p12
aVThey belonged to boys who would join business
p13
aVand inherit business from parents,
p14
aVand girls would be dolled up to get married.
p15
aVMy family, in my city,
p16
aVand almost in the country, was unique.
p17
aVWe were four of us, not one,
p18
aVand fortunately no boys.
p19
aVWe were four girls and no boys.
p20
aVAnd my parents were part
p21
aVof a landed property family.
p22
aVMy father defied his own grandfather,
p23
aValmost to the point of disinheritance,
p24
aVbecause he decided to educate
p25
aVall four of us.
p26
aVHe sent us to one of the best schools in the city
p27
aVand gave us the best education.
p28
aVAs I've said, when we're born, we don't choose our parents,
p29
aVand when we go to school, we don't choose our school.
p30
aVChildren don't choose a school.
p31
aVThey just get the school which parents choose for them.
p32
aVSo this is the foundation time which I got.
p33
aVI grew up like this, and so did my other three sisters.
p34
aVAnd my father used to say at that time,
p35
aV"I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world."
p36
aVI don't know if he really meant [that], but it happened.
p37
aVI'm the only one who's left in India.
p38
aVOne is a British, another is an American
p39
aVand the third is a Canadian.
p40
aVSo we are four of us in four corners of the world.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd since I said they're my role models,
p43
aVI followed two things which my father and mother gave me.
p44
aVOne, they said, "Life is on an incline.
p45
aVYou either go up,
p46
aVor you come down."
p47
aVAnd the second thing, which has stayed with me,
p48
aVwhich became my philosophy of life,
p49
aVwhich made all the difference,
p50
aVis: 100 things happen in your life, good or bad.
p51
aVOut of 100, 90 are your creation.
p52
aVThey're good. They're your creation. Enjoy it.
p53
aVIf they're bad, they're your creation. Learn from it.
p54
aVTen are nature-sent over which you can't do a thing.
p55
aVIt's like a death of a relative,
p56
aVor a cyclone, or a hurricane, or an earthquake.
p57
aVYou can't do a thing about it.
p58
aVYou've got to just respond to the situation.
p59
aVBut that response comes out of those 90 points.
p60
aVSince I'm a product of this philosophy,
p61
aVof 90/10,
p62
aVand secondly, "life on an incline,"
p63
aVthat's the way I grew up
p64
aVto be valuing what I got.
p65
aVI'm a product of opportunities,
p66
aVrare opportunities in the '50s and the '60s,
p67
aVwhich girls didn't get,
p68
aVand I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me
p69
aVwas something unique.
p70
aVBecause all of my best school friends were getting dolled up
p71
aVto get married with a lot of dowry,
p72
aVand here I was with a tennis racket and going to school
p73
aVand doing all kinds of extracurricular activities.
p74
aVI thought I must tell you this.
p75
aVWhy I said this, is the background.
p76
aa(lp77
VThis is what comes next.
p78
aVI joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman,
p79
aVa woman with indefatigable stamina,
p80
aVbecause I used to run for my tennis titles, etc.
p81
aVBut I joined the Indian Police Service,
p82
aVand then it was a new pattern of policing.
p83
aVFor me the policing stood for power to correct,
p84
aVpower to prevent and power to detect.
p85
aVThis is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India \u2014
p86
aVthe power to prevent.
p87
aVBecause normally it was always said, power to detect, and that's it,
p88
aVor power to punish.
p89
aVBut I decided no, it's a power to prevent,
p90
aVbecause that's what I learned when I was growing up.
p91
aVHow do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10?
p92
aVSo this was how it came into my service,
p93
aVand it was different from the men.
p94
aVI didn't want to make it different from the men, but it was different,
p95
aVbecause this was the way I was different.
p96
aVAnd I redefined policing concepts in India.
p97
aVI'm going to take you on two journeys,
p98
aVmy policing journey and my prison journey.
p99
aVWhat you see, if you see the title
p100
aVcalled "PM's car held."
p101
aVThis was the first time a prime minister of India
p102
aVwas given a parking ticket.
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aVThat's the first time in India,
p105
aVand I can tell you, that's the last time you're hearing about it.
p106
aVIt'll never happen again in India,
p107
aVbecause now it was once and forever.
p108
aVAnd the rule was, because I was sensitive,
p109
aVI was compassionate, I was very sensitive to injustice,
p110
aVand I was very pro-justice.
p111
aVThat's the reason, as a woman, I joined the Indian Police Service.
p112
aVI had other options, but I didn't choose them.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo I'm going to move on.
p115
aVThis is about tough policing, equal policing.
p116
aVNow I was known as "here's a woman that's not going to listen."
p117
aVSo I was sent to all indiscriminate postings,
p118
aVpostings which others would say no.
p119
aVI now went to a prison assignment as a police officer.
p120
aVNormally police officers don't want to do prison.
p121
aVThey sent me to prison to lock me up,
p122
aVthinking, "Now there will be no cars
p123
aVand no VIPs to be given tickets to.
p124
aVLet's lock her up."
p125
aVHere I got a prison assignment.
p126
aVThis was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals.
p127
aVObviously, it was.
p128
aVBut 10,000 men,
p129
aVof which only 400 were women \u2014 10,000 \u2014
p130
aV9,000 plus about 600
p131
aVwere men.
p132
aVTerrorists, rapists,
p133
aVburglars, gangsters \u2014
p134
aVsome of them I'd sent to jail
p135
aVas a police officer outside.
p136
aVAnd then how did I deal with them?
p137
aVThe first day when I went in,
p138
aVI didn't know how to look at them.
p139
aVAnd I said, "Do you pray?" When I looked at the group, I said, "Do you pray?"
p140
aVThey saw me as a young, short woman wearing a pathan suit.
p141
aVI said, "Do you pray?"
p142
aVAnd they didn't say anything.
p143
aVI said, "Do you pray? Do you want to pray?"
p144
aVThey said, "Yes." I said, "All right, let's pray."
p145
aVI prayed for them, and things started to change.
p146
aVThis is a visual of education inside the prison.
p147
aa(lp148
VFriends, this has never happened,
p149
aVwhere everybody in the prison studies.
p150
aVI started this with community support.
p151
aVGovernment had no budget.
p152
aVIt was one of the finest, largest volunteerism
p153
aVin any prison in the world.
p154
aVThis was initiated in Delhi prison.
p155
aVYou see one sample
p156
aVof a prisoner teaching a class.
p157
aVThese are hundreds of classes.
p158
aVNine to eleven, every prisoner went into the education program \u2014
p159
aVthe same den in which they thought
p160
aVthey would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten.
p161
aVWe converted this into an ashram \u2014
p162
aVfrom a prison to an ashram through education.
p163
aVI think that's the bigger change.
p164
aVIt was the beginning of a change.
p165
aVTeachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers.
p166
aVBooks came from donated schoolbooks.
p167
aVStationery was donated.
p168
aVEverything was donated,
p169
aVbecause there was no budget of education for the prison.
p170
aVNow if I'd not done that,
p171
aVit would have been a hellhole.
p172
aa(lp173
VThat's the second landmark.
p174
aVI want to show you some moments of history in my journey,
p175
aVwhich probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world.
p176
aVOne, the numbers you'll never get to see.
p177
aVSecondly, this concept.
p178
aVThis was a meditation program inside the prison
p179
aVof over 1,000 prisoners.
p180
aVOne thousand prisoners who sat in meditation.
p181
aVThis was one of the most courageous steps
p182
aVI took as a prison governor.
p183
aVAnd this is what transformed.
p184
aVYou want to know more about this,
p185
aVgo and see this film, "Doing Time, Doing Vipassana."
p186
aVYou will hear about it, and you will love it.
p187
aVAnd write to me on KiranBedi.com,
p188
aVand I'll respond to you.
p189
aVLet me show you the next slide.
p190
aVI took the same concept of mindfulness,
p191
aVbecause, why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison?
p192
aVBecause crime is a product of a distorted mind.
p193
aVIt was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control.
p194
aVNot by preaching, not by telling,
p195
aVnot by reading, but by addressing your mind.
p196
aVI took the same thing to the police,
p197
aVbecause police, equally, were prisoners of their minds,
p198
aVand they felt as if it was "we" and "they,"
p199
aVand that the people don't cooperate.
p200
aVThis worked.
p201
aa(lp202
VThis is a feedback box called a petition box.
p203
aVThis is a concept which I introduced
p204
aVto listen to complaints, listen to grievances.
p205
aVThis was a magic box.
p206
aVThis was a sensitive box.
p207
aVThis is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison.
p208
aVIf you see somebody in the blue \u2014
p209
aVyeah, this guy \u2014
p210
aVhe was a prisoner, and he was a teacher.
p211
aVAnd you see, everybody's busy. There was no time to waste.
p212
aa(lp213
VLet me wrap it up.
p214
aVI'm currently into movements,
p215
aVmovements of education
p216
aVof the under-served children,
p217
aVwhich is thousands \u2014 India is all about thousands.
p218
aVSecondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India.
p219
aVThat's a big way
p220
aVwe, as a small group of activists,
p221
aVhave drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India.
p222
aVFriends, you will hear a lot about it.
p223
aVThat's the movement at the moment I'm driving,
p224
aVand that's the movement and ambition of my life.
p225
aa(lp226
VThank you very much.
p227
aV(Applause)
p228
aVThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
p229
aVThank you. Thank you. Thank you.
