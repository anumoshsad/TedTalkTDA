VThe stories we tell about each other
p4
aVmatter very much.
p5
aVThe stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter.
p6
aVAnd most of all,
p7
aVI think the way that we participate in each other's stories
p8
aVis of deep importance.
p9
aVI was six years old
p10
aVwhen I first heard stories about the poor.
p11
aVNow I didn't hear those stories from the poor themselves,
p12
aVI heard them from my Sunday school teacher
p13
aVand Jesus, kind of via my Sunday school teacher.
p14
aVI remember learning that people who were poor
p15
aVneeded something material \u2014
p16
aVfood, clothing, shelter \u2014 that they didn't have.
p17
aVAnd I also was taught, coupled with that,
p18
aVthat it was my job \u2014 this classroom full of five and six year-old children \u2014
p19
aVit was our job, apparently, to help.
p20
aVThis is what Jesus asked of us.
p21
aVAnd then he said, "What you do for the least of these, you do for me."
p22
aVNow I was pretty psyched.
p23
aVI was very eager to be useful in the world \u2014
p24
aVI think we all have that feeling.
p25
aVAnd also, it was kind of interesting that God needed help.
p26
aVThat was news to me,
p27
aVand it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut I also learned very soon thereafter
p30
aVthat Jesus also said, and I'm paraphrasing,
p31
aVthe poor would always be with us.
p32
aVThis frustrated and confused me;
p33
aVI felt like I had been just given a homework assignment
p34
aVthat I had to do, and I was excited to do,
p35
aVbut no matter what I would do, I would fail.
p36
aVSo I felt confused, a little bit frustrated and angry,
p37
aVlike maybe I'd misunderstood something here.
p38
aVAnd I felt overwhelmed.
p39
aVAnd for the first time,
p40
aVI began to fear this group of people
p41
aVand to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people.
p42
aVI imagined in my head, a kind of long line of individuals
p43
aVthat were never going away, that would always be with us.
p44
aVThey were always going to ask me to help them and give them things,
p45
aVwhich I was excited to do,
p46
aVbut I didn't know how it was going to work.
p47
aVAnd I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give,
p48
aVespecially if the problem was never going away.
p49
aVIn the years following,
p50
aVthe other stories I heard about the poor growing up
p51
aVwere no more positive.
p52
aVFor example, I saw pictures and images
p53
aVfrequently of sadness and suffering.
p54
aVI heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor.
p55
aVI heard about disease, I heard about war \u2014
p56
aVthey always seemed to be kind of related.
p57
aVAnd in general,
p58
aVI got this sort of idea
p59
aVthat the poor in the world lived lives
p60
aVthat were wrought with suffering and sadness,
p61
aVdevastation, hopelessness.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd after a while, I developed what I think many of us do,
p64
aVis this predictable response,
p65
aVwhere I started to feel bad every time I heard about them.
p66
aVI started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth,
p67
aVbecause I wasn't doing more, apparently, to make things better.
p68
aVAnd I even felt a sense of shame because of that.
p69
aVAnd so naturally,
p70
aVI started to distance myself.
p71
aVI stopped listening to their stories
p72
aVquite as closely as I had before.
p73
aVAnd I stopped expecting things to really change.
p74
aVNow I still gave \u2014 on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved.
p75
aVI gave of my time and my money,
p76
aVI gave when solutions were on sale.
p77
aVThe cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life, right.
p78
aVI mean who can argue with that?
p79
aVI gave when I was cornered, when it was difficult to avoid
p80
aVand I gave, in general, when the negative emotions built up enough
p81
aVthat I gave to relieve my own suffering,
p82
aVnot someone else's.
p83
aVThe truth be told, I was giving out of that place,
p84
aVnot out of a genuine place of hope
p85
aVand excitement to help and of generosity.
p86
aVIt became a transaction for me,
p87
aVbecame sort of a trade.
p88
aVI was purchasing something \u2014
p89
aVI was buying my right to go on with my day
p90
aVand not necessarily be bothered by this bad news.
p91
aVAnd I think the way that we go through that sometimes
p92
aVcan, first of all,
p93
aVdisembody a group of people, individuals out there in the world.
p94
aVAnd it can also turn into a commodity,
p95
aVwhich is a very scary thing.
p96
aVSo as I did this, and as I think many of us do this,
p97
aVwe kind of buy our distance,
p98
aVwe kind of buy our right to go on with our day.
p99
aVI think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most.
p100
aVIt can get in the way of our desire
p101
aVto really be meaningful and useful in another person's life
p102
aVand, in short to love.
p103
aa(lp104
VThankfully, a few years ago, things shifted for me
p105
aVbecause I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus.
p106
aVI know many in the room probably know exactly who he is,
p107
aVbut to give the shorthand version
p108
aVfor any who have not heard him speak,
p109
aVDr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago
p110
aVfor his work pioneering modern microfinance.
p111
aVWhen I heard him speak, it was three years before that.
p112
aVBut basically, microfinance \u2014 if this is new to you as well \u2014
p113
aVthink of that as financial services for the poor.
p114
aVThink of all the things you get at your bank
p115
aVand imagine those products and services
p116
aVtailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day.
p117
aVDr. Yunus shared his story,
p118
aVexplaining what that was,
p119
aVand what he had done with his Grameen Bank.
p120
aVHe also talked about, in particular, microlending,
p121
aVwhich is a tiny loan
p122
aVthat could help someone start or grow a business.
p123
aVNow, when I heard him speak, it was exciting for a number of reasons.
p124
aVFirst and foremost, I learned about this new method of change in the world
p125
aVthat, for once, showed me, maybe,
p126
aVa way to interact with someone
p127
aVand to give, to share of a resource in a way that wasn't weird
p128
aVand didn't make me feel bad \u2014
p129
aVthat was exciting.
p130
aVBut more importantly, he told stories about the poor
p131
aVthat were different than any stories I had heard before.
p132
aVIn fact, those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note.
p133
aVHe was talking about strong, smart,
p134
aVhardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day
p135
aVand were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better.
p136
aVAll they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better
p137
aVwas a little bit of capital.
p138
aVIt was an amazing sort of insight for me.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd I, in fact, was so deeply moved by this \u2014
p141
aVit's hard to express now how much that affected me \u2014
p142
aVbut I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later,
p143
aVand I moved to East Africa
p144
aVto try to see for myself what this was about.
p145
aVFor the first time, actually, in a long time
p146
aVI wanted to meet those individuals, I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs,
p147
aVand see for myself what their lives were actually about.
p148
aVSo I spent three months in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania
p149
aVinterviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars
p150
aVto start or grow a business.
p151
aVAnd in fact, through those interactions,
p152
aVfor the first time, I was starting to get to be friends
p153
aVwith some of those people in that big amorphous group out there
p154
aVthat was supposed to be far away.
p155
aVI was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories.
p156
aVAnd over and over again,
p157
aVas I interviewed them and spent my days with them,
p158
aVI did hear stories of life change
p159
aVand amazing little details of change.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo I would hear from goat herders
p162
aVwho had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats.
p163
aVTheir business trajectory would change.
p164
aVThey would make a little bit more money;
p165
aVtheir standard of living
p166
aVwould shift and would get better.
p167
aVAnd they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives,
p168
aVlike they would start to send their children to school.
p169
aVThey might be able to buy mosquito nets.
p170
aVMaybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure.
p171
aVMaybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea
p172
aVand offer that to me when I came as their guest
p173
aVand that made them feel proud.
p174
aVBut there were these beautiful details, even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row,
p175
aVand some days that's what happened \u2014
p176
aVthese beautiful details of life change
p177
aVthat were meaningful to them.
p178
aVThat was another thing that really touched me.
p179
aVIt was really humbling to see for the first time,
p180
aVto really understand
p181
aVthat even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything,
p182
aVI probably would have gotten a lot wrong.
p183
aVBecause the best way for people to change their lives
p184
aVis for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them.
p185
aVSo I saw that and it was very humbling.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnyway, another interesting thing happened while I was there.
p188
aVI never once was asked for a donation,
p189
aVwhich had kind of been my mode, right.
p190
aVThere's poverty, you give money to help \u2014
p191
aVno one asked me for a donation.
p192
aVIn fact, no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all.
p193
aVIf anything, they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already
p194
aVand to build on their own capabilities.
p195
aVSo what I did hear, once in a while,
p196
aVwas that people wanted a loan \u2014
p197
aVI thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting.
p198
aVAnd by the way, I was a philosophy and poetry major in school,
p199
aVso I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa.
p200
aVI just got this impression that the money would work.
p201
aVAnd my introduction to business
p202
aVwas in these $100 little infuses of capital.
p203
aVAnd I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things,
p204
aVfrom farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders.
p205
aVSo this idea
p206
aVthat these new stories of business and hope
p207
aVmight be shared with my friends and family,
p208
aVand through that, maybe we could get some of the money that they needed
p209
aVto be able to continue their businesses as loans,
p210
aVthat's this little idea that turned into Kiva.
p211
aa(lp212
VA few months later, I went back to Uganda
p213
aVwith a digital camera and a basic website
p214
aVthat my partner, Matthew, and I had kind of built,
p215
aVand took pictures of seven of my new friends,
p216
aVposted their stories, these stories of entrepreneurship, up on the website,
p217
aVspammed friends and family and said, "We think this is legal.
p218
aVHaven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details,
p219
aVbut do you say, do you want to help participate in this,
p220
aVprovide the money that they need?"
p221
aVThe money came in basically overnight.
p222
aVWe sent it over to Uganda.
p223
aVAnd over the next six months, a beautiful thing happened;
p224
aVthe entrepreneurs received the money,
p225
aVthey were paid, and their businesses, in fact, grew,
p226
aVand they were able to support themselves
p227
aVand change the trajectory of their lives.
p228
aVIn October of '05,
p229
aVafter those first seven loans were paid,
p230
aVMatt and I took the word beta off of the site.
p231
aVWe said, "Our little experiment has been a success.
p232
aVLet's start for real." That was our official launch.
p233
aVAnd then that first year, October '05 through '06,
p234
aVKiva facilitated $500,000 in loans.
p235
aVThe second year, it was a total of 15 million.
p236
aVThe third year, the total was up to around 40.
p237
aVThe fourth year, we were just short of 100.
p238
aVAnd today, less than five years in,
p239
aVKiva's facilitated
p240
aVmore than 150 million dollars, in little 25-dollar bits,
p241
aVfrom lenders and entrepreneurs \u2014
p242
aVmore than a million of those, collectively in 200 countries.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo that's where Kiva is today, just to bring you right up to the present.
p245
aVAnd while those numbers and those statistics
p246
aVare really fun to talk about and they're interesting,
p247
aVto me, Kiva's really about stories.
p248
aVIt's about retelling
p249
aVthe story of the poor,
p250
aVand it's about giving ourselves
p251
aVan opportunity to engage
p252
aVthat validates their dignity,
p253
aVvalidates a partnership relationship,
p254
aVnot a relationship that's based
p255
aVon the traditional sort of donor beneficiary
p256
aVweirdness that can happen.
p257
aVBut instead a relationship that can promote respect
p258
aVand hope
p259
aVand this optimism
p260
aVthat together we can move forward.
p261
aVSo what I hope is that,
p262
aVnot only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva \u2014
p263
aVthat's a very positive and meaningful thing \u2014
p264
aVbut I hope Kiva can blur those lines, like I said,
p265
aVbetween the traditional rich and poor categories
p266
aVthat we're taught to see in the world,
p267
aVthis false dichotomy of us and them, have and have not.
p268
aVI hope that Kiva can blur those lines.
p269
aVBecause as that happens,
p270
aVI think we can feel free to interact
p271
aVin a way that's more open, more just and more creative,
p272
aVto engage with each other and to help each other.
p273
aa(lp274
VImagine how you feel
p275
aVwhen you see somebody on street who is begging
p276
aVand you're about to approach them.
p277
aVImagine how you feel;
p278
aVand then imagine the difference when you might see somebody
p279
aVwho has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work
p280
aVwho wants to tell you about their business.
p281
aVMaybe they're smiling, and they want to talk to you about what they've done.
p282
aVImagine if you're speaking with somebody
p283
aVwho's growing things and making them flourish,
p284
aVsomebody who's using their talents
p285
aVto do something productive,
p286
aVsomebody who's built their own business from scratch,
p287
aVsomeone who is surrounded by abundance,
p288
aVnot scarcity,
p289
aVwho's in fact creating abundance,
p290
aVsomebody with full hands with something to offer,
p291
aVnot empty hands
p292
aVasking for you to give them something.
p293
aVImagine if you could hear a story you didn't expect
p294
aVof somebody who wakes up every day
p295
aVand works very, very hard to make their life better.
p296
aVThese stories can really change the way that we think about each other.
p297
aVAnd if we can catalyze
p298
aVa supportive community to come around these individuals
p299
aVand to participate in their story
p300
aVby lending a little bit of money,
p301
aVI think that can change the way we believe in each other
p302
aVand each other's potential.
p303
aa(lp304
VNow for me, Kiva is just the beginning.
p305
aVAnd as I look forward to what is next,
p306
aVit's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far.
p307
aVThe first one is, as I mentioned, entrepreneurship was a new idea to me.
p308
aVKiva borrowers, as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years,
p309
aVhave taught me what entrepreneurship is.
p310
aVAnd I think, at its core, it's deciding that you want your life to be better.
p311
aVYou see an opportunity
p312
aVand you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that.
p313
aVIn short, it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today
p314
aVand going after that.
p315
aVSecond thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity.
p316
aVSo they're not a donation.
p317
aVYeah, maybe it doesn't sound that much different.
p318
aVBut in fact, when you give something to someone
p319
aVand they say, "Thanks," and let you know how things go,
p320
aVthat's one thing.
p321
aVWhen you lend them money, and they slowly pay you back over time,
p322
aVyou have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue.
p323
aVThis continued attention \u2014 this ongoing attention \u2014
p324
aVis a really big deal
p325
aVto build different kinds of relationships among us.
p326
aVAnd then third, from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know,
p327
aVwhen all else is equal,
p328
aVgiven the option to have just money to do what you need to do,
p329
aVor money plus the support and encouragement
p330
aVof a global community,
p331
aVpeople choose the community plus the money.
p332
aVThat's a much more meaningful combination, a more powerful combination.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo with that in mind, this particular incident
p335
aVhas led to the things that I'm working on now.
p336
aVI see entrepreneurs everywhere now, now that I'm tuned into this.
p337
aVAnd one thing that I've seen
p338
aVis there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world.
p339
aVWith social networks,
p340
aVit's an amazing way, growing the number of people that we all have around us
p341
aVin our own supportive communities, rapidly.
p342
aVAnd so, as I have been thinking about this,
p343
aVI've been wondering: how can we engage these supportive communities
p344
aVto catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas
p345
aVand to catalyze all of us
p346
aVto make tomorrow better than today?
p347
aVAs I've researched what's going on in the United States,
p348
aVa few interesting little insights have come up.
p349
aVSo one is that, of course, as we all might expect,
p350
aVmany small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world
p351
aVstill need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do
p352
aVor they might need money during a hard month.
p353
aVBut there's always a need for resources close by.
p354
aVAnother thing is, it turns out,
p355
aVthose resources don't usually come from the places you might expect \u2014
p356
aVbanks, venture capitalists,
p357
aVother organizations and support structures \u2014
p358
aVthey come from friends and family.
p359
aVSome statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses
p360
aVcomes from friends and family.
p361
aVThat's around 130 billion dollars a year \u2014
p362
aVit's a lot.
p363
aVAnd third, so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process,
p364
aVit's very awkward, people don't know exactly what to ask for,
p365
aVhow to ask, what to promise in return,
p366
aVeven though they have the best of intentions
p367
aVand want to thank those people that are supporting them.
p368
aa(lp369
VSo to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way
p370
aVand to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves
p371
aVexactly what that financial exchange should look like,
p372
aVexactly what fits them and the people around them,
p373
aVthis week actually,
p374
aVwe're quietly doing a launch of Profounder,
p375
aVwhich is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need
p376
aVthrough investments from their friends and family.
p377
aVAnd it's investments, not donations, not loans,
p378
aVbut investments that have a dynamic return.
p379
aVSo the mapping of participating in the story,
p380
aVit actually flows with the up and down.
p381
aVSo in short, it's a do-it-yourself tool
p382
aVfor small businesses to raise these funds.
p383
aVAnd what you can do is go onto the site, create a profile,
p384
aVcreate investment terms in a really easy way.
p385
aVWe make it really, really simple for me
p386
aVas well as anyone else who wants to use the site.
p387
aVAnd we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues.
p388
aVThey can raise up to a million dollars
p389
aVfrom an unlimited number of unaccredited, unsophisticated investors \u2014
p390
aVeveryday people, heaven forbid \u2014
p391
aVand they can share those returns over time \u2014
p392
aVagain, whatever terms they set.
p393
aVAs investors choose to become involved
p394
aVbased on those terms,
p395
aVthey can either take their rewards back as cash,
p396
aVor they can decide in advance
p397
aVto give those returns away to a non-profit.
p398
aVSo they can be a cash, or a cause, investor.
p399
aVIt's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea
p400
aVa path to go do what they want to do in the world
p401
aVand to gather the people around them that they already have,
p402
aVthe people that know them best
p403
aVand that love them and want to support them,
p404
aVto gather them to make this happen.
p405
aa(lp406
VSo that's what I'm working on now.
p407
aVAnd to close, I just want to say, look these are tools.
p408
aVRight now, Profounder's right at the very beginning,
p409
aVand it's very palpable; it's very clear to me, that it's just a vessel, it's just a tool.
p410
aVWhat we need are for people to care, to actually go use it,
p411
aVjust like they've cared enough to use Kiva
p412
aVto make those connections.
p413
aVBut the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care \u2014
p414
aVI'm not even going to try.
p415
aVI don't think, even though we often hear,
p416
aVyou know, hear the ethical and moral reasons,
p417
aVthe religious reasons,
p418
aV"Here's why caring and giving will make you happier."
p419
