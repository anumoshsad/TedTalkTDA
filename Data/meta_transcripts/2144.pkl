V2014 is a very special year for me:
p4
aV20 years as a consultant,
p5
aV20 years of marriage,
p6
aVand I'm turning 50 in one month.
p7
aVThat means I was born in 1964 in a small town in Germany.
p8
aa(lp9
VIt was a gray November day,
p10
aVand I was overdue.
p11
aVThe hospital's maternity ward was really stressed out
p12
aVbecause a lot of babies were born on this gray November day.
p13
aVAs a matter of fact,
p14
aV1964 was the year with the highest birth rate ever in Germany:
p15
aVmore than 1.3 million.
p16
aVLast year, we just hit over 600,000,
p17
aVso half of my number.
p18
aa(lp19
VWhat you can see here is the German age pyramid,
p20
aVand there, the small black point at the top, that's me.
p21
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p22
aVIn red, you can see the potential working-age population,
p23
aVso people over 15 and under 65,
p24
aVand I'm actually only interested in this red area.
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, let's do a simple simulation
p27
aVof how this age structure will develop over the next couple of years.
p28
aVAs you can see,
p29
aVthe peak is moving to the right,
p30
aVand I, with many other baby boomers, will retire in 2030.
p31
aVBy the way, I don't need any forecasts
p32
aVof birth rates for predicting this red area.
p33
aVThe red area,
p34
aVso the potential working-age population in 2030,
p35
aVis already set in stone today,
p36
aVexcept for much higher migration rates.
p37
aVAnd if you compare this red area in 2030 with the red area in 2014,
p38
aVit is much, much smaller.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo before I show you the rest of the world,
p41
aVwhat does this mean for Germany?
p42
aVSo what we know from this picture is that the labor supply,
p43
aVso people who provide labor,
p44
aVwill go down in Germany, and will go down significantly.
p45
aVNow, what about labor demand?
p46
aVThat's where it gets tricky.
p47
aVAs you might know, the consultant's favorite answer to any question is,
p48
aV"It depends."
p49
aVSo I would say it depends.
p50
aVWe didn't want to forecast the future.
p51
aVHighly speculative.
p52
aVWe did something else.
p53
aVWe looked at the GDP and productivity growth of Germany
p54
aVover the last 20 years,
p55
aVand calculated the following scenario:
p56
aVif Germany wants to continue this GDP and productivity growth,
p57
aVwe could directly calculate
p58
aVhow many people Germany would need to support this growth.
p59
aVAnd this is the green line: labor demand.
p60
aVSo Germany will run into a major talent shortage very quickly.
p61
aVEight million people are missing,
p62
aVwhich is more than 20 percent of our current workforce,
p63
aVso big numbers, really big numbers.
p64
aVAnd we calculated several scenarios,
p65
aVand the picture always looked like this.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow, to close the gap,
p68
aVGermany has to significantly increase migration,
p69
aVget many more women in the workforce,
p70
aVincrease retirement age \u2014
p71
aVby the way, we just lowered it this year \u2014
p72
aVand all these measures at once.
p73
aVIf Germany fails here, Germany will stagnate.
p74
aVWe won't grow anymore. Why?
p75
aVBecause the workers are not there who can generate this growth.
p76
aVAnd companies will look for talents somewhere else.
p77
aVBut where?
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, we simulated labor supply and labor demand
p80
aVfor the largest 15 economies in the world,
p81
aVrepresenting more than 70 percent of world GDP,
p82
aVand the overall picture looks like this by 2020.
p83
aVBlue indicates a labor surplus,
p84
aVred indicates a labor shortfall,
p85
aVand gray are those countries which are borderline.
p86
aVSo by 2020, we still see a labor surplus in some countries,
p87
aVlike Italy, France, the U.S.,
p88
aVbut this picture will change dramatically by 2030.
p89
aVBy 2030, we will face a global workforce crisis
p90
aVin most of our largest economies,
p91
aVincluding three out of the four BRIC countries.
p92
aVChina, with its former one-child policy, will be hit,
p93
aVas well as Brazil and Russia.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, to tell the truth,
p96
aVin reality, the situation will be even more challenging.
p97
aVWhat you can see here are average numbers.
p98
aVWe de-averaged them
p99
aVand broke them down into different skill levels,
p100
aVand what we found
p101
aVwere even higher shortfalls for high-skilled people
p102
aVand a partial surplus for low-skilled workers.
p103
aVSo on top of an overall labor shortage,
p104
aVwe will face a big skill mismatch in the future,
p105
aVand this means huge challenges
p106
aVin terms of education, qualification,
p107
aVupskilling for governments and companies.
p108
aa(lp109
VNow, the next thing we looked into was robots, automation, technology.
p110
aVWill technology change this picture and boost productivity?
p111
aVNow, the short answer would be
p112
aVthat our numbers already include a significant growth in productivity
p113
aVdriven by technology.
p114
aVA long answer would go like this.
p115
aVLet's take Germany again.
p116
aVThe Germans have a certain reputation in the world
p117
aVwhen it comes to productivity.
p118
aVIn the '90s, I worked in our Boston office for almost two years,
p119
aVand when I left, an old senior partner told me, literally,
p120
aV"Send me more of these Germans, they work like machines."
p121
aV(Laughter)
p122
aVThat was 1998.
p123
aVSixteen years later, you'd probably say the opposite.
p124
aV"Send me more of these machines. They work like Germans."
p125
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p126
aa(lp127
VTechnology will replace a lot of jobs, regular jobs.
p128
aVNot only in the production industry,
p129
aVbut even office workers are in jeopardy
p130
aVand might be replaced by robots,
p131
aVartificial intelligence, big data, or automation.
p132
aVSo the key question is not if technology replaces some of these jobs,
p133
aVbut when, how fast, and to what extent?
p134
aVOr in other words,
p135
aVwill technology help us to solve this global workforce crisis?
p136
aVYes and no.
p137
aVThis is a more sophisticated version of "it depends."
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VLet's take the automotive industry as an example,
p141
aVbecause there, more than 40 percent of industrial robots are already working
p142
aVand automation has already taken place.
p143
aVIn 1980, less than 10 percent of the production cost of a car
p144
aVwas caused by electronic parts.
p145
aVToday, this number is more than 30 percent
p146
aVand it will grow to more than 50 percent by 2030.
p147
aVAnd these new electronic parts and applications
p148
aVrequire new skills and have created a lot of new jobs,
p149
aVlike the cognitive systems engineer
p150
aVwho optimizes the interaction between driver and electronic system.
p151
aVIn 1980, no one had the slightest clue that such a job would ever exist.
p152
aVAs a matter of fact,
p153
aVthe overall number of people involved in the production of a car
p154
aVhas only changed slightly in the last decades,
p155
aVin spite of robots and automation.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo what does this mean?
p158
aVYes, technology will replace a lot of jobs,
p159
aVbut we will also see a lot of new jobs and new skills on the horizon,
p160
aVand that means technology will worsen our overall skill mismatch.
p161
aVAnd this kind of de-averaging
p162
aVreveals the crucial challenge for governments and businesses.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo people, high-skilled people,
p165
aVtalents, will be the big thing in the next decade.
p166
aVIf they are the scarce resource, we have to understand them much better.
p167
aVAre they actually willing to work abroad?
p168
aVWhat are their job preferences?
p169
aa(lp170
VTo find out, this year we conducted a global survey
p171
aVamong more than 200,000 job seekers from 189 countries.
p172
aVMigration is certainly one key measure to close a gap,
p173
aVat least in the short term,
p174
aVso we asked about mobility.
p175
aVMore than 60 percent of these 200,000 job seekers
p176
aVare willing to work abroad.
p177
aVFor me, a surprisingly high number.
p178
aVIf you look at the employees aged 21 to 30,
p179
aVthis number is even higher.
p180
aVIf you split this number up by country,
p181
aVyes, the world is mobile, but only partly.
p182
aVThe least mobile countries are Russia, Germany and the U.S.
p183
aVNow where would these people like to move?
p184
aVNumber seven is Australia, where 28 percent could imagine moving.
p185
aVThen France, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, U.K.,
p186
aVand the top choice worldwide is the U.S.
p187
aa(lp188
VNow, what are the job preferences of these 200,000 people?
p189
aVSo, what are they looking for?
p190
aVOut of a list of 26 topics, salary is only number eight.
p191
aVThe top four topics are all around culture.
p192
aVNumber four,
p193
aVhaving a great relationship with the boss;
p194
aVthree, enjoying a great work-life balance;
p195
aVtwo, having a great relationship with colleagues;
p196
aVand the top priority worldwide
p197
aVis being appreciated for your work.
p198
aVSo, do I get a thank you?
p199
aVNot only once a year with the annual bonus payment,
p200
aVbut every day.
p201
aVAnd now, our global workforce crisis becomes very personal.
p202
aVPeople are looking for recognition.
p203
aVAren't we all looking for recognition in our jobs?
p204
aa(lp205
VNow, let me connect the dots.
p206
aVWe will face a global workforce crisis
p207
aVwhich consists of an overall labor shortage
p208
aVplus a huge skill mismatch,
p209
aVplus a big cultural challenge.
p210
aVAnd this global workforce crisis is approaching very fast.
p211
aVRight now, we are just at the turning point.
p212
aVSo what can we, what can governments, what can companies do?
p213
aVEvery company,
p214
aVbut also every country,
p215
aVneeds a people strategy,
p216
aVand to act on it immediately,
p217
aVand such a people strategy consists of four parts.
p218
aVNumber one, a plan
p219
aVfor how to forecast supply and demand for different jobs and different skills.
p220
aVWorkforce planning will become  more important than financial planning.
p221
aVTwo, a plan for how to attract great people:
p222
aVgeneration Y, women, but also retirees.
p223
aVThree, a plan for how to educate and upskill them.
p224
aVThere's a huge upskilling challenge ahead of us.
p225
aVAnd four,
p226
aVfor how to retain the best people,
p227
aVor in other words,
p228
aVhow to realize an appreciation and relationship culture.
p229
aa(lp230
VHowever, one crucial underlying factor is to change our attitudes.
p231
aVEmployees are resources, are assets,
p232
aVnot costs, not head counts,
p233
aVnot machines,
p234
aVnot even the Germans.
p235
aa(lp236
VThank you.
