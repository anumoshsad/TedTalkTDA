VI am a vicar in the Church of England.
p4
aVI've been a priest in the Church for 20 years.
p5
aVFor most of that time, I've been struggling and grappling
p6
aVwith questions about the nature of God. Who is God?
p7
aVAnd I'm very aware that when you say the word "God,"
p8
aVmany people will turn off immediately.
p9
aVAnd most people, both within and outside the organized church,
p10
aVstill have a picture of a celestial controller,
p11
aVa rule maker, a policeman in the sky who orders everything,
p12
aVand causes everything to happen.
p13
aVHe will protect his own people,
p14
aVand answer the prayers of the faithful.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd in the worship of my church,
p17
aVthe most frequently used adjective about God is "almighty."
p18
aVBut I have a problem with that.
p19
aVI have become more and more uncomfortable
p20
aVwith this perception of God over the years.
p21
aVDo we really believe that God is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting
p22
aVin our worship and in our liturgies over all these years?
p23
aa(lp24
VOf course, there have been thinkers
p25
aVwho have suggested different ways of looking at God.
p26
aVExploring the feminine, nurturing side of divinity.
p27
aVSuggesting that God expresses Himself or Herself through powerlessness,
p28
aVrather than power.
p29
aVAcknowledging that God is unknown and unknowable by definition.
p30
aVFinding deep resonances with other religions and philosophies
p31
aVand ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and global search for meaning.
p32
aVThese ideas are well known in liberal academic circles,
p33
aVbut clergy like myself have been reluctant to air them,
p34
aVfor fear of creating tension and division in our church communities,
p35
aVfor fear of upsetting the simple faith of more traditional believers.
p36
aVI have chosen not to rock the boat.
p37
aa(lp38
VThen, on December 26th last year, just two months ago,
p39
aVthat underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami.
p40
aVAnd two weeks later, Sunday morning, 9th of January,
p41
aVI found myself standing in front of my congregation \u2014
p42
aVintelligent, well meaning, mostly thoughtful Christian people \u2014
p43
aVand I needed to express, on their behalf, our feelings and our questions.
p44
aVI had my own personal responses, but I also have a public role,
p45
aVand something needed to be said.
p46
aVAnd this is what I said.
p47
aa(lp48
VShortly after the tsunami I read a newspaper article
p49
aVwritten by the Archbishop of Canterbury \u2014 fine title \u2014
p50
aVabout the tragedy in Southern Asia.
p51
aVThe essence of what he said was this:
p52
aVthe people most affected by the devastation and loss of life
p53
aVdo not want intellectual theories about how God let this happen.
p54
aVHe wrote, "If some religious genius did come up with an explanation
p55
aVof exactly why all these deaths made sense,
p56
aVwould we feel happier, or safer, or more confident in God?"
p57
aa(lp58
VIf the man in the photograph that appeared in the newspapers,
p59
aVholding the hand of his dead child was standing in front of us now,
p60
aVthere are no words that we could say to him.
p61
aVA verbal response would not be appropriate.
p62
aVThe only appropriate response would be a compassionate silence
p63
aVand some kind of practical help.
p64
aVIt isn't a time for explanation, or preaching, or theology;
p65
aVit's a time for tears.
p66
aa(lp67
VThis is true. And yet here we are, my church in Oxford,
p68
aVsemi-detached from events that happened a long way away,
p69
aVbut with our faith bruised.
p70
aVAnd we want an explanation from God.
p71
aVWe demand an explanation from God.
p72
aVSome have concluded that we can only believe in a God who shares our pain.
p73
aVIn some way, God must feel the anguish, and grief,
p74
aVand physical pain that we feel.
p75
aVIn some way the eternal God must be able to enter into the souls of human beings
p76
aVand experience the torment within.
p77
aVAnd if this is true, it must also be that God knows the joy and exaltation
p78
aVof the human spirit, as well.
p79
aVWe want a God who can weep with those who weep,
p80
aVand rejoice with those who rejoice.
p81
aa(lp82
VThis seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing re-statement
p83
aVof Christian belief about God.
p84
aVFor hundreds of years, the prevailing orthodoxy, the accepted truth,
p85
aVwas that God the Father, the Creator, is unchanging
p86
aVand therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness.
p87
aVNow the unchanging God feels a bit cold and indifferent to me.
p88
aVAnd the devastating events of the 20th century
p89
aVhave forced people to question the cold, unfeeling God.
p90
aVThe slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps
p91
aVhave caused people to ask, "Where is God in all this?
p92
aVWho is God in all this?"
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd the answer was, "God is in this with us,
p95
aVor God doesn't deserve our allegiance anymore."
p96
aVIf God is a bystander, observing but not involved,
p97
aVthen God may well exist, but we don't want to know about Him.
p98
aVMany Jews and Christians now feel like this, I know.
p99
aVAnd I am among them.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo we have a suffering God \u2014
p102
aVa God who is intimately connected with this world and with every living soul.
p103
aVI very much relate to this idea of God.
p104
aVBut it isn't enough. I need to ask some more questions,
p105
aVand I hope they are questions that you will want to ask, as well,
p106
aVsome of you.
p107
aa(lp108
VOver the last few weeks I have been struck by the number of times
p109
aVthat words in our worship have felt a bit inappropriate, a bit dodgy.
p110
aVWe have a pram service on Tuesday mornings for mums and their pre-school children.
p111
aVAnd last week we sang with the children one of their favorite songs,
p112
aV"The Wise Man Built His House Upon the Rock."
p113
aVPerhaps some of you know it. Some of the words go like this:
p114
aV"The foolish man built his house upon the sand /
p115
aVAnd the floods came up / And the house on the sand went crash."
p116
aVThen in the same week, at a funeral,
p117
aVwe sang the familiar hymn "We Plow the Fields and Scatter,"
p118
aVa very English hymn.
p119
aVIn the second verse comes the line, "The wind and waves obey Him."
p120
aVDo they? I don't feel we can sing that song again in church,
p121
aVafter what's happened.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo the first big question is about control.
p124
aVDoes God have a plan for each of us? Is God in control?
p125
aVDoes God order each moment? Does the wind and the waves obey Him?
p126
aVFrom time to time,
p127
aVone hears Christians telling the story of how God organized things for them,
p128
aVso that everything worked out all right \u2014
p129
aVsome difficulty overcome, some illness cured, some trouble averted,
p130
aVa parking space found at a crucial time.
p131
aVI can remember someone saying this to me,
p132
aVwith her eyes shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith
p133
aVand the goodness of God.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut if God can or will do these things \u2014
p136
aVintervene to change the flow of events \u2014
p137
aVthen surely he could have stopped the tsunami.
p138
aVDo we have a local God who can do little things like parking spaces,
p139
aVbut not big things like 500 mile-per-hour waves?
p140
aVThat's just not acceptable to intelligent Christians,
p141
aVand we must acknowledge it.
p142
aVEither God is responsible for the tsunami,
p143
aVor God is not in control.
p144
aa(lp145
VAfter the tragedy, survival stories began to emerge.
p146
aVYou probably heard some of them:
p147
aVthe man who surfed the wave,
p148
aVthe teenage girl who recognized the danger
p149
aVbecause she had just been learning about tsunamis at school.
p150
aVThen there was the congregation who had left their usual church building on the shore
p151
aVto hold a service in the hills.
p152
aVThe preacher delivered an extra long sermon,
p153
aVso that they were still out of harm's way when the wave struck.
p154
aVAfterwards someone said that God must have been looking after them.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo the next question is about partiality.
p157
aVCan we earn God's favor by worshipping Him or believing in Him?
p158
aVDoes God demand loyalty, like any medieval tyrant?
p159
aVA God who looks after His own, so that Christians are OK,
p160
aVwhile everyone else perishes?
p161
aVA cosmic us and them, and a God who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism?
p162
aVThat would be appalling,
p163
aVand that would be the point at which I would hand in my membership.
p164
aVSuch a God would be morally inferior to the highest ideals of humanity.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo who is God, if not the great puppet-master or the tribal protector?
p167
aVPerhaps God allows or permits terrible things to happen,
p168
aVso that heroism and compassion can be shown.
p169
aVPerhaps God is testing us: testing our charity, or our faith.
p170
aVPerhaps there is a great, cosmic plan that allows for horrible suffering
p171
aVso that everything will work out OK in the end.
p172
aVPerhaps, but these ideas are all just variations on God controlling everything,
p173
aVthe supreme commander toying with expendable units in a great campaign.
p174
aVWe are still left with a God who can do the tsunami and allow Auschwitz.
p175
aa(lp176
VIn his great novel, "The Brothers Karamazov," Dostoevsky gives these words to Ivan,
p177
aVaddressed to his naive and devout younger brother, Alyosha:
p178
aV"If the sufferings of children go to make up the sum of sufferings
p179
aVwhich is necessary for the purchase of truth,
p180
aVthen I say beforehand that the entire truth is not worth such a price.
p181
aVWe cannot afford to pay so much for admission.
p182
aVIt is not God that I do not accept.
p183
aVI merely, most respectfully, return Him the ticket."
p184
aa(lp185
VOr perhaps God set the whole universe going at the beginning
p186
aVand then relinquished control forever,
p187
aVso that natural processes could occur, and evolution run its course.
p188
aVThis seems more acceptable,
p189
aVbut it still leaves God with the ultimate moral responsibility.
p190
aVIs God a cold, unfeeling spectator?
p191
aVOr a powerless lover, watching with infinite compassion
p192
aVthings God is unable to control or change?
p193
aVIs God intimately involved in our suffering,
p194
aVso that He feels it in His own being?
p195
aa(lp196
VIf we believe something like this, we must let go of the puppet-master completely,
p197
aVtake our leave of the almighty controller, abandon traditional models.
p198
aVWe must think again about God.
p199
aVMaybe God doesn't do things at all.
p200
aVMaybe God isn't an agent like all of us are agents.
p201
aVEarly religious thought conceived God as a sort of superhuman person,
p202
aVdoing things all over the place.
p203
aVBeating up the Egyptians, drowning them in the Red Sea, wasting cities, getting angry.
p204
aVThe people knew their God by His mighty acts.
p205
aa(lp206
VBut what if God doesn't act? What if God doesn't do things at all?
p207
aVWhat if God is in things?
p208
aVThe loving soul of the universe.
p209
aVAn in-dwelling compassionate presence, underpinning and sustaining all things.
p210
aVWhat if God is in things?
p211
aVIn the infinitely complex network of relationships and connections that make up life.
p212
aVIn the natural cycle of life and death,
p213
aVthe creation and destruction that must happen continuously.
p214
aVIn the process of evolution.
p215
aVIn the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world.
p216
aVIn the collective unconscious, the soul of the human race.
p217
aVIn you, in me, mind and body and spirit.
p218
aVIn the tsunami, in the victims. In the depth of things.
p219
aVIn presence and in absence. In simplicity and complexity.
p220
aVIn change and development and growth.
p221
aa(lp222
VHow does this in-ness, this innerness, this interiority of God work?
p223
aVIt's hard to conceive, and begs more questions.
p224
aVIs God just another name for the universe,
p225
aVwith no independent existence at all?
p226
aVI don't know.
p227
aVTo what extent can we ascribe personality to God?
p228
aVI don't know.
p229
aVIn the end, we have to say, "I don't know."
p230
aVIf we knew, God would not be God.
p231
aa(lp232
VTo have faith in this God
p233
aVwould be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe,
p234
aVand less like believing a system of doctrinal statements.
p235
aVIsn't it ironic that Christians who claim to believe
p236
aVin an infinite, unknowable being
p237
aVthen tie God down in closed systems and rigid doctrines?
p238
aa(lp239
VHow could one practice such a faith?
p240
aVBy seeking the God within. By cultivating my own inwardness.
p241
aVIn silence, in meditation, in my inner space, in the me that remains
p242
aVwhen I gently put aside my passing emotions and ideas and preoccupations.
p243
aVIn awareness of the inner conversation.
p244
aa(lp245
VAnd how would we live such a faith? How would I live such a faith?
p246
aVBy seeking intimate connection with your inwardness.
p247
aVThe kind of relationships when deep speaks to deep.
p248
aVIf God is in all people, then there is a meeting place
p249
aVwhere my relationship with you becomes a three-way encounter.
p250
aVThere is an Indian greeting, which I'm sure some of you know:
p251
aV"Namaste," accompanied by a respectful bow,
p252
aVwhich, roughly translated means,
p253
aV"That which is of God in me greets that which of God is in you."
p254
aVNamaste.
p255
aa(lp256
VAnd how would one deepen such a faith?
p257
aVBy seeking the inwardness which is in all things.
p258
aVIn music and poetry, in the natural world of beauty
p259
aVand in the small ordinary things of life,
p260
aVthere is a deep, indwelling presence that makes them extraordinary.
p261
aVIt needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting,
p262
aVa contemplative attitude and a generosity and openness
p263
aVto those whose experience is different from my own.
p264
aa(lp265
VWhen I stood up to speak to my people about God and the tsunami,
p266
aVI had no answers to offer them.
p267
aVNo neat packages of faith, with Bible references to prove them.
p268
aVOnly doubts and questioning and uncertainty.
p269
aVI had some suggestions to make \u2014
p270
aVpossible new ways of thinking about God.
p271
aVWays that might allow us to go on, down a new and uncharted road.
p272
aVBut in the end, the only thing I could say for sure was, "I don't know,"
p273
aVand that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all.
p274
aa(lp275
VThank you.
