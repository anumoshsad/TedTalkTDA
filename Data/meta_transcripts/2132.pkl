VThe first patient to ever be  treated with an antibiotic
p4
aVwas a policeman in Oxford.
p5
aVOn his day off from work,
p6
aVhe was scratched by a rose thorn while working in the garden.
p7
aVThat small scratch became infected.
p8
aVOver the next few days,  his head was swollen
p9
aVwith abscesses,
p10
aVand in fact his eye was so infected
p11
aVthat they had to take it out,
p12
aVand by February of 1941,
p13
aVthis poor man was on the verge of dying.
p14
aVHe was at Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford,
p15
aVand fortunately for him,
p16
aVa small team of doctors
p17
aVled by a Dr. Howard Florey
p18
aVhad managed to synthesize
p19
aVa very small amount of penicillin,
p20
aVa drug that had been discovered
p21
aV12 years before by Alexander Fleming
p22
aVbut had never actually been  used to treat a human,
p23
aVand indeed no one even  knew if the drug would work,
p24
aVif it was full of impurities  that would kill the patient,
p25
aVbut Florey and his team figured
p26
aVif they had to use it,  they might as well use it
p27
aVon someone who was going to die anyway.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo they gave Albert Alexander,
p30
aVthis Oxford policeman, the drug,
p31
aVand within 24 hours,
p32
aVhe started getting better.
p33
aVHis fever went down,  his appetite came back.
p34
aVSecond day, he was doing much better.
p35
aVThey were starting to  run out of penicillin,
p36
aVso what they would do  was run with his urine
p37
aVacross the road to re-synthesize  the penicillin from his urine
p38
aVand give it back to him,
p39
aVand that worked.
p40
aVDay four, well on the way to recovery.
p41
aVThis was a miracle.
p42
aVDay five, they ran out of penicillin,
p43
aVand the poor man died.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo that story didn't end that well,
p46
aVbut fortunately for  millions of other people,
p47
aVlike this child who was treated  again in the early 1940s,
p48
aVwho was again dying of a sepsis,
p49
aVand within just six days, you can see,
p50
aVrecovered thanks to this  wonder drug, penicillin.
p51
aVMillions have lived,
p52
aVand global health has been transformed.
p53
aVNow, antibiotics have been used
p54
aVfor patients like this,
p55
aVbut they've also been  used rather frivolously
p56
aVin some instances,
p57
aVfor treating someone  with just a cold or the flu,
p58
aVwhich they might not have  responded to an antibiotic,
p59
aVand they've also been  used in large quantities
p60
aVsub-therapeutically, which means in small concentrations,
p61
aVto make chicken and hogs grow faster.
p62
aVJust to save a few pennies on the price of meat,
p63
aVwe've spent a lot of  antibiotics on animals,
p64
aVnot for treatment, not for sick animals,
p65
aVbut primarily for growth promotion.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow, what did that lead us to?
p68
aVBasically, the massive use of antibiotics
p69
aVaround the world
p70
aVhas imposed such large selection pressure on bacteria
p71
aVthat resistance is now a problem,
p72
aVbecause we've now selected for just
p73
aVthe resistant bacteria.
p74
aa(lp75
VAnd I'm sure you've all read about this in the newspapers,
p76
aVyou've seen this in every magazine
p77
aVthat you come across,
p78
aVbut I really want you to appreciate
p79
aVthe significance of this problem.
p80
aVThis is serious.
p81
aVThe next slide I'm about to show you is  of carbapenem resistance in acinetobacter.
p82
aVAcinetobacter is a nasty hospital bug,
p83
aVand carbapenem is pretty much
p84
aVthe strongest class of antibiotics
p85
aVthat we can throw at this bug.
p86
aVAnd you can see in 1999
p87
aVthis is the pattern of resistance,
p88
aVmostly under about 10 percent across the United States.
p89
aVNow watch what happens  when we play the video.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo I don't know where you live,
p92
aVbut wherever it is, it certainly is a lot worse now
p93
aVthan it was in 1999,
p94
aVand that is the problem of antibiotic resistance.
p95
aVIt's a global issue
p96
aVaffecting both rich and poor countries,
p97
aVand at the heart of it,  you might say, well,
p98
aVisn't this really just a medical issue?
p99
aVIf we taught doctors how not  to use antibiotics as much,
p100
aVif we taught patients how  not to demand antibiotics,
p101
aVperhaps this really wouldn't be an issue,
p102
aVand maybe the pharmaceutical companies
p103
aVshould be working harder to develop
p104
aVmore antibiotics.
p105
aVNow, it turns out that there's something  fundamental about antibiotics
p106
aVwhich makes it different from other drugs,
p107
aVwhich is that if I misuse antibiotics
p108
aVor I use antibiotics,
p109
aVnot only am I affected but  others are affected as well,
p110
aVin the same way as if I  choose to drive to work
p111
aVor take a plane to go somewhere,
p112
aVthat the costs I impose on others
p113
aVthrough global climate change go everywhere,
p114
aVand I don't necessarily take these costs into consideration.
p115
aVThis is what economists might  call a problem of the commons,
p116
aVand the problem of the commons is exactly
p117
aVwhat we face in the case  of antibiotics as well:
p118
aVthat we don't consider \u2014
p119
aVand we, including individuals, patients,
p120
aVhospitals, entire health systems \u2014
p121
aVdo not consider the costs  that they impose on others
p122
aVby the way antibiotics are actually used.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow, that's a problem that's similar
p125
aVto another area that we all know about,
p126
aVwhich is of fuel use and energy,
p127
aVand of course energy use
p128
aVboth depletes energy as well as
p129
aVleads to local pollution  and climate change.
p130
aVAnd typically, in the case of energy,
p131
aVthere are two ways in which you can deal with the problem.
p132
aVOne is, we can make better use of the oil that we have,
p133
aVand that's analogous to making better use
p134
aVof existing antibiotics,
p135
aVand we can do this in a number of ways
p136
aVthat we'll talk about in a second,
p137
aVbut the other option is the  "drill, baby, drill" option,
p138
aVwhich in the case of antibiotics  is to go find new antibiotics.
p139
aa(lp140
VNow, these are not separate.
p141
aVThey're related, because if we invest heavily
p142
aVin new oil wells,
p143
aVwe reduce the incentives  for conservation of oil
p144
aVin the same way that's going  to happen for antibiotics.
p145
aVThe reverse is also going  to happen, which is that
p146
aVif we use our antibiotics appropriately,
p147
aVwe don't necessarily have  to make the investments
p148
aVin new drug development.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd if you thought that these two were entirely,
p151
aVfully balanced between these two options,
p152
aVyou might consider the fact that
p153
aVthis is really a game that we're playing.
p154
aVThe game is really one of coevolution,
p155
aVand coevolution is, in  this particular picture,
p156
aVbetween cheetahs and gazelles.
p157
aVCheetahs have evolved to run faster,
p158
aVbecause if they didn't run faster,
p159
aVthey wouldn't get any lunch.
p160
aVGazelles have evolved to run faster because
p161
aVif they don't run faster, they would be lunch.
p162
aVNow, this is the game we're playing against the bacteria,
p163
aVexcept we're not the cheetahs,
p164
aVwe're the gazelles,
p165
aVand the bacteria would,
p166
aVjust in the course of this little talk,
p167
aVwould have had kids and grandkids
p168
aVand figured out how to be resistant
p169
aVjust by selection and trial and error,
p170
aVtrying it over and over again.
p171
aVWhereas how do we stay  ahead of the bacteria?
p172
aVWe have drug discovery processes,
p173
aVscreening molecules,
p174
aVwe have clinical trials,
p175
aVand then, when we think we have a drug,
p176
aVthen we have the FDA regulatory process.
p177
aVAnd once we go through all of that,
p178
aVthen we try to stay one step ahead
p179
aVof the bacteria.
p180
aa(lp181
VNow, this is clearly not a  game that can be sustained,
p182
aVor one that we can win
p183
aVby simply innovating to stay ahead.
p184
aVWe've got to slow the pace of coevolution down,
p185
aVand there are ideas that we  can borrow from energy
p186
aVthat are helpful in thinking about
p187
aVhow we might want to do this in the case
p188
aVof antibiotics as well.
p189
aVNow, if you think about how we deal with
p190
aVenergy pricing, for instance,
p191
aVwe consider emissions taxes,
p192
aVwhich means we're imposing  the costs of pollution
p193
aVon people who actually use that energy.
p194
aVWe might consider doing that for antibiotics as well,
p195
aVand perhaps that would make sure that antibiotics
p196
aVactually get used appropriately.
p197
aVThere are clean energy subsidies,
p198
aVwhich are to switch to fuels which don't pollute as much
p199
aVor perhaps don't need fossil fuels.
p200
aVNow, the analogy here is, perhaps we need
p201
aVto move away from using antibiotics,
p202
aVand if you think about it, what are  good substitutes for antibiotics?
p203
aVWell, turns out that anything that reduces
p204
aVthe need for the antibiotic would really work,
p205
aVso that could include improving hospital infection control
p206
aVor vaccinating people,
p207
aVparticularly against  the seasonal influenza.
p208
aVAnd the seasonal flu is probably
p209
aVthe biggest driver of antibiotic use,
p210
aVboth in this country as well as in many other countries,
p211
aVand that could really help.
p212
aVA third option might include something like tradeable permits.
p213
aVAnd these seem like faraway scenarios,
p214
aVbut if you consider the  fact that we might not
p215
aVhave antibiotics for many  people who have infections,
p216
aVwe might consider the fact that we might
p217
aVwant to allocate who actually gets to use
p218
aVsome of these antibiotics over others,
p219
aVand some of these might have to be on the basis of clinical need,
p220
aVbut also on the basis of pricing.
p221
aVAnd certainly consumer education works.
p222
aVVery often, people overuse antibiotics
p223
aVor prescribe too much without necessarily
p224
aVknowing that they do so,
p225
aVand feedback mechanisms
p226
aVhave been found to be useful,
p227
aVboth on energy \u2014
p228
aVWhen you tell someone that they're using
p229
aVa lot of energy during peak hour,
p230
aVthey tend to cut back,
p231
aVand the same sort of example has been performed
p232
aVeven in the case of antibiotics.
p233
aVA hospital in St. Louis basically would put up
p234
aVon a chart the names of surgeons
p235
aVin the ordering of how much antibiotics they'd used
p236
aVin the previous month,
p237
aVand this was purely an  informational feedback,
p238
aVthere was no shaming,
p239
aVbut essentially that provided  some information back
p240
aVto surgeons that maybe they could rethink
p241
aVhow they were using antibiotics.
p242
aa(lp243
VNow, there's a lot that can be done
p244
aVon the supply side as well.
p245
aVIf you look at the price of penicillin,
p246
aVthe cost per day is about 10 cents.
p247
aVIt's a fairly cheap drug.
p248
aVIf you take drugs that have been introduced since then \u2014
p249
aVlinezolid or daptomycin \u2014
p250
aVthose are significantly more expensive,
p251
aVso to a world that has been used to paying 10 cents a day for antibiotics,
p252
aVthe idea of paying 180 dollars per day
p253
aVseems like a lot.
p254
aVBut what is that really telling us?
p255
aVThat price is telling us
p256
aVthat we should no longer
p257
aVtake cheap, effective  antibiotics as a given
p258
aVinto the foreseeable future,
p259
aVand that price is a signal to us
p260
aVthat perhaps we need to be paying
p261
aVmuch more attention to conservation.
p262
aVThat price is also a signal
p263
aVthat maybe we need to start looking at other technologies,
p264
aVin the same way that  gasoline prices are a signal
p265
aVand an impetus, to, say,
p266
aVthe development of electric cars.
p267
aVPrices are important signals
p268
aVand we need to pay attention,
p269
aVbut we also need to consider the fact that
p270
aValthough these high prices seem unusual for antibiotics,
p271
aVthey're nothing compared to the price per day
p272
aVof some cancer drugs,
p273
aVwhich might save a patient's life only for a few months or perhaps a year,
p274
aVwhereas antibiotics would potentially
p275
aVsave a patient's life forever.
p276
aVSo this is going to involve
p277
aVa whole new paradigm shift,
p278
aVand it's also a scary shift because
p279
aVin many parts of this country,
p280
aVin many parts of the world,
p281
aVthe idea of paying 200 dollars
p282
aVfor a day of antibiotic treatment
p283
aVis simply unimaginable.
p284
aVSo we need to think about that.
p285
aa(lp286
VNow, there are backstop options,
p287
aVwhich is other alternative technologies
p288
aVthat people are working on.
p289
aVIt includes bacteriophages, probiotics,
p290
aVquorum sensing, synbiotics.
p291
aa(lp292
VNow, all of these are useful avenues to pursue,
p293
aVand they will become even more lucrative
p294
aVwhen the price of new  antibiotics starts going higher,
p295
aVand we've seen that the market does actually respond,
p296
aVand the government is now considering
p297
aVways of subsidizing new  antibiotics and development.
p298
aVBut there are challenges here.
p299
aVWe don't want to just throw money at a problem.
p300
aVWhat we want to be able to do
p301
aVis invest in new antibiotics
p302
aVin ways that actually encourage
p303
aVappropriate use and sales of those antibiotics,
p304
aVand that really is the challenge here.
p305
aa(lp306
VNow, going back to these technologies,
p307
aVyou all remember the line from that famous
p308
aVdinosaur film, "Nature will find a way."
p309
aVSo it's not as if these are  permanent solutions.
p310
aVWe really have to remember that, whatever the technology might be,
p311
aVthat nature will find some  way to work around it.
p312
aa(lp313
VYou might think, well,  this is just a problem
p314
aVjust with antibiotics and with bacteria,
p315
aVbut it turns out that we  have the exact same
p316
aVidentical problem in  many other fields as well,
p317
aVwith multidrug-resistant tuberculosis,
p318
aVwhich is a serious problem  in India and South Africa.
p319
aVThousands of patients are dying because
p320
aVthe second-line drugs are so expensive,
p321
aVand in some instances, even those don't work
p322
aVand you have XDR TB.
p323
aVViruses are becoming resistant.
p324
aVAgricultural pests. Malaria parasites.
p325
aVRight now, much of the world depends on
p326
aVone drug, artemisinin drugs,
p327
aVessentially to treat malaria.
p328
aVResistance to artemisinin has already emerged,
p329
aVand if this were to become widespread,
p330
aVthat puts at risk
p331
aVthe single drug that we have to  treat malaria around the world
p332
aVin a way that's currently  safe and efficacious.
p333
aVMosquitos develop resistance.
p334
aVIf you have kids, you probably  know about head lice,
p335
aVand if you're from New York City,
p336
aVI understand that the  specialty there is bedbugs.
p337
aVSo those are also resistant.
p338
aVAnd we have to bring an example from across the pond.
p339
aVTurns out that rats are  also resistant to poisons.
p340
aa(lp341
VNow, what's common  to all of these things is
p342
aVthe idea that we've had these technologies
p343
aVto control nature only for  the last 70, 80 or 100 years
p344
aVand essentially in a blink,
p345
aVwe have squandered our ability to control,
p346
aVbecause we have not recognized
p347
aVthat natural selection and  evolution was going to find
p348
aVa way to get back,
p349
aVand we need to completely rethink
p350
aVhow we're going to use
p351
aVmeasures to control biological organisms,
p352
aVand rethink how we incentivize
p353
aVthe development, introduction,
p354
aVin the case of antibiotics prescription,
p355
aVand use of these valuable resources.
p356
aVAnd we really now need to  start thinking about them
p357
aVas natural resources.
p358
aVAnd so we stand at a crossroads.
p359
aVAn option is to go through that rethinking
p360
aVand carefully consider incentives
p361
aVto change how we do business.
p362
aVThe alternative is
p363
aVa world in which even a blade of grass
p364
aVis a potentially lethal weapon.
