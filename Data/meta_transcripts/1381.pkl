VSo a couple of years ago I started a program
p4
aVto try to get the rockstar tech and design people
p5
aVto take a year off
p6
aVand work in the one environment
p7
aVthat represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate;
p8
aVwe have them work in government.
p9
aVThe program is called Code for America,
p10
aVand it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks.
p11
aVWe select a few fellows every year
p12
aVand we have them work with city governments.
p13
aVInstead of sending them off into the Third World,
p14
aVwe send them into the wilds of City Hall.
p15
aVAnd there they make great apps, they work with city staffers.
p16
aVBut really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible
p17
aVwith technology today.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo meet Al.
p20
aVAl is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston.
p21
aVHere it kind of looks like he's looking for a date,
p22
aVbut what he's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in,
p23
aVbecause he knows he's not very good at fighting fires
p24
aVwhen he's covered in four feet of snow.
p25
aVNow how did he come to be looking for help
p26
aVin this very unique manner?
p27
aVWe had a team of fellows in Boston last year
p28
aVthrough the Code for America program.
p29
aVThey were there in February, and it snowed a lot in February last year.
p30
aVAnd they noticed that the city never gets
p31
aVto digging out these fire hydrants.
p32
aVBut one fellow in particular,
p33
aVa guy named Erik Michaels-Ober,
p34
aVnoticed something else,
p35
aVand that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks
p36
aVright in front of these things.
p37
aVSo he did what any good developer would do,
p38
aVhe wrote an app.
p39
aa(lp40
VIt's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant.
p41
aVSo you agree to dig it out when it snows.
p42
aVIf you do, you get to name it,
p43
aVand he called the first one Al.
p44
aVAnd if you don't, someone can steal it from you.
p45
aVSo it's got cute little game dynamics on it.
p46
aVThis is a modest little app.
p47
aVIt's probably the smallest
p48
aVof the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year.
p49
aVBut it's doing something
p50
aVthat no other government technology does.
p51
aVIt's spreading virally.
p52
aa(lp53
VThere's a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu
p54
aVwho saw this app and realized
p55
aVthat he could use it, not for snow,
p56
aVbut to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens.
p57
aVIt's very important that these tsunami sirens work,
p58
aVbut people steal the batteries out of them.
p59
aVSo he's getting citizens to check on them.
p60
aVAnd then Seattle decided to use it
p61
aVto get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains.
p62
aVAnd Chicago just rolled it out
p63
aVto get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows.
p64
aVSo we now know of nine cities
p65
aVthat are planning to use this.
p66
aVAnd this has spread just frictionlessly,
p67
aVorganically, naturally.
p68
aa(lp69
VIf you know anything about government technology,
p70
aVyou know that this isn't how it normally goes.
p71
aVProcuring software usually takes a couple of years.
p72
aVWe had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year
p73
aVthat took three people about two and a half months.
p74
aVIt was a way that parents could figure out
p75
aVwhich were the right public schools for their kids.
p76
aVWe were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels,
p77
aVit would have taken at least two years
p78
aVand it would have cost about two million dollars.
p79
aVAnd that's nothing.
p80
aVThere is one project in the California court system right now
p81
aVthat so far cost taxpayers
p82
aVtwo billion dollars,
p83
aVand it doesn't work.
p84
aVAnd there are projects like this
p85
aVat every level of government.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo an app that takes a couple of days to write
p88
aVand then spreads virally,
p89
aVthat's sort of a shot across the bow
p90
aVto the institution of government.
p91
aVIt suggests how government could work better \u2014
p92
aVnot more like a private company,
p93
aVas many people think it should.
p94
aVAnd not even like a tech company,
p95
aVbut more like the Internet itself.
p96
aVAnd that means permissionless,
p97
aVit means open, it means generative.
p98
aVAnd that's important.
p99
aVBut what's more important about this app
p100
aVis that it represents how a new generation
p101
aVis tackling the problem of government \u2014
p102
aVnot as the problem of an ossified institution,
p103
aVbut as a problem of collective action.
p104
aVAnd that's great news,
p105
aVbecause, it turns out, we're very good at collective action
p106
aVwith digital technology.
p107
aa(lp108
VNow there's a very large community of people
p109
aVthat are building the tools that we need
p110
aVto do things together effectively.
p111
aVIt's not just Code for America fellows,
p112
aVthere are hundreds of people all over the country
p113
aVthat are standing and writing civic apps
p114
aVevery day in their own communities.
p115
aVThey haven't given up on government.
p116
aVThey are frustrated as hell with it,
p117
aVbut they're not complaining about it,
p118
aVthey're fixing it.
p119
aVAnd these folks know something
p120
aVthat we've lost sight of.
p121
aVAnd that's that when you strip away all your feelings
p122
aVabout politics and the line at the DMV
p123
aVand all those other things
p124
aVthat we're really mad about,
p125
aVgovernment is, at its core,
p126
aVin the words of Tim O'Reilly,
p127
aV"What we do together that we can't do alone."
p128
aa(lp129
VNow a lot of people have given up on government.
p130
aVAnd if you're one of those people,
p131
aVI would ask that you reconsider,
p132
aVbecause things are changing.
p133
aVPolitics is not changing;
p134
aVgovernment is changing.
p135
aVAnd because government
p136
aVultimately derives its power from us \u2014
p137
aVremember "We the people?" \u2014
p138
aVhow we think about it
p139
aVis going to effect how that change happens.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow I didn't know very much about government when I started this program.
p142
aVAnd like a lot of people,
p143
aVI thought government was basically about getting people elected to office.
p144
aVWell after two years, I've come to the conclusion
p145
aVthat, especially local government,
p146
aVis about opossums.
p147
aa(lp148
VThis is the call center for the services and information line.
p149
aVIt's generally where you will get
p150
aVif you call 311 in your city.
p151
aVIf you should ever have the chance
p152
aVto staff your city's call center,
p153
aVas our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program \u2014
p154
aVin fact, they all do that \u2014
p155
aVyou will find that people call government
p156
aVwith a very wide range of issues,
p157
aVincluding having an opossum stuck in your house.
p158
aVSo Scott gets this call.
p159
aVHe types "Opossum" into this official knowledge base.
p160
aVHe doesn't really come up with anything. He starts with animal control.
p161
aVAnd finally, he says, "Look, can you just open all the doors to your house
p162
aVand play music really loud
p163
aVand see if the thing leaves?"
p164
aVSo that worked. So booya for Scott.
p165
aVBut that wasn't the end of the opossums.
p166
aa(lp167
VBoston doesn't just have a call center.
p168
aVIt has an app, a Web and mobile app,
p169
aVcalled Citizens Connect.
p170
aVNow we didn't write this app.
p171
aVThis is the work of the very smart people
p172
aVat the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston.
p173
aVSo one day \u2014 this is an actual report \u2014 this came in:
p174
aV"Opossum in my trashcan. Can't tell if it's dead.
p175
aVHow do I get this removed?"
p176
aVBut what happens with Citizens Connect is different.
p177
aVSo Scott was speaking person-to-person.
p178
aVBut on Citizens Connect everything is public,
p179
aVso everybody can see this.
p180
aVAnd in this case, a neighbor saw it.
p181
aVAnd the next report we got said,
p182
aV"I walked over to this location,
p183
aVfound the trashcan behind the house.
p184
aVOpossum? Check. Living? Yep.
p185
aVTurned trashcan on its side. Walked home.
p186
aVGoodnight sweet opossum."
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VPretty simple.
p191
aVSo this is great. This is the digital meeting the physical.
p192
aVAnd it's also a great example
p193
aVof government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game.
p194
aVBut it's also a great example of government as a platform.
p195
aVAnd I don't mean necessarily
p196
aVa technological definition of platform here.
p197
aVI'm just talking about a platform for people
p198
aVto help themselves and to help others.
p199
aVSo one citizen helped another citizen,
p200
aVbut government played a key role here.
p201
aVIt connected those two people.
p202
aVAnd it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed,
p203
aVbut a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative
p204
aVto government services.
p205
aVWhen one neighbor helps another,
p206
aVwe strengthen our communities.
p207
aVWe call animal control, it just costs a lot of money.
p208
aa(lp209
VNow one of the important things we need to think about government
p210
aVis that it's not the same thing as politics.
p211
aVAnd most people get that,
p212
aVbut they think that one is the input to the other.
p213
aVThat our input to the system of government
p214
aVis voting.
p215
aVNow how many times have we elected a political leader \u2014
p216
aVand sometimes we spend a lot of energy
p217
aVgetting a new political leader elected \u2014
p218
aVand then we sit back and we expect government
p219
aVto reflect our values and meet our needs,
p220
aVand then not that much changes?
p221
aVThat's because government is like a vast ocean
p222
aVand politics is the six-inch layer on top.
p223
aVAnd what's under that
p224
aVis what we call bureaucracy.
p225
aVAnd we say that word with such contempt.
p226
aVBut it's that contempt
p227
aVthat keeps this thing that we own
p228
aVand we pay for
p229
aVas something that's working against us, this other thing,
p230
aVand then we're disempowering ourselves.
p231
aa(lp232
VPeople seem to think politics is sexy.
p233
aVIf we want this institution to work for us,
p234
aVwe're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy.
p235
aVBecause that's where the real work of government happens.
p236
aVWe have to engage with the machinery of government.
p237
aVSo that's OccupytheSEC movement has done.
p238
aVHave you seen these guys?
p239
aVIt's a group of concerned citizens
p240
aVthat have written a very detailed
p241
aV325-page report
p242
aVthat's a response to the SEC's request for comment
p243
aVon the Financial Reform Bill.
p244
aVThat's not being politically active,
p245
aVthat's being bureaucratically active.
p246
aa(lp247
VNow for those of us who've given up on government,
p248
aVit's time that we asked ourselves
p249
aVabout the world that we want to leave for our children.
p250
aVYou have to see the enormous challenges
p251
aVthat they're going to face.
p252
aVDo we really think we're going to get where we need to go
p253
aVwithout fixing the one institution
p254
aVthat can act on behalf of all of us?
p255
aVWe can't do without government,
p256
aVbut we do need it
p257
aVto be more effective.
p258
aVThe good news is that technology is making it possible
p259
aVto fundamentally reframe
p260
aVthe function of government
p261
aVin a way that can actually scale
p262
aVby strengthening civil society.
p263
aVAnd there's a generation out there that's grown up on the Internet,
p264
aVand they know that it's not that hard
p265
aVto do things together,
p266
aVyou just have to architect the systems the right way.
p267
aa(lp268
VNow the average age of our fellows is 28,
p269
aVso I am, begrudgingly,
p270
aValmost a generation older than most of them.
p271
aVThis is a generation
p272
aVthat's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted.
p273
aVThey're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting
p274
aVabout who gets to speak;
p275
aVthey all get to speak.
p276
aVThey can express their opinion
p277
aVon any channel at any time,
p278
aVand they do.
p279
aVSo when they're faced with the problem of government,
p280
aVthey don't care as much
p281
aVabout using their voices.
p282
aVThey're using their hands.
p283
aVThey're using their hands
p284
aVto write applications that make government work better.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd those applications let us use our hands
p287
aVto make our communities better.
p288
aVThat could be shoveling out a hydrant, pulling a weed,
p289
aVturning over a garbage can with an opossum in it.
p290
aVAnd certainly, we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along,
p291
aVand many people do.
p292
aVBut these apps are like little digital reminders
p293
aVthat we're not just consumers,
p294
aVand we're not just consumers of government,
p295
aVputting in our taxes and getting back services.
p296
aVWe're more than that,
p297
aVwe're citizens.
p298
aVAnd we're not going to fix government
p299
aVuntil we fix citizenship.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo the question I have for all of you here:
p302
aVWhen it comes to the big, important things
p303
aVthat we need to do together,
p304
aVall of us together,
p305
aVare we just going to be a crowd of voices,
p306
aVor are we also going to be
p307
aVa crowd of hands?
p308
aa(lp309
VThank you.
