VOur face is hugely important
p4
aVbecause it's the external, visual part
p5
aVthat everybody else sees.
p6
aVLet's not forget it's a functional entity.
p7
aVWe have strong skull bones
p8
aVthat protect the most important organ in our body: the brain.
p9
aVIt's where our senses are located, our special senses \u2014
p10
aVour vision, our speech,
p11
aVour hearing, our smell, our taste.
p12
aVAnd this bone
p13
aVis peppered, as you can see, with the light shining through the skull
p14
aVwith cavities, the sinuses,
p15
aVwhich warm and moisten the air we breathe.
p16
aVBut also imagine if they were filled with solid bone \u2014
p17
aVour head would be dead weight,
p18
aVwe wouldn't be able to hold it erect,
p19
aVwe wouldn't be able to look at the world around us.
p20
aVThis woman is slowly dying
p21
aVbecause the benign tumors in her facial bones
p22
aVhave completely obliterated her mouth and her nose
p23
aVso she can't breathe and eat.
p24
aa(lp25
VAttached to the facial bones
p26
aVthat define our face's structure
p27
aVare the muscles that deliver our facial expression,
p28
aVour universal language of expression,
p29
aVour social-signaling system.
p30
aVAnd overlying this is the skin drape,
p31
aVwhich is a hugely complex
p32
aVthree-dimensional structure \u2014
p33
aVtaking right-angled bends here and there,
p34
aVhaving thin areas like the eyelids,
p35
aVthick areas like the cheek, different colors.
p36
aVAnd then we have the sensual factor of the face.
p37
aVWhere do we like to kiss people?
p38
aVOn the lips. Nibble the ears maybe.
p39
aVIt's the face where we're attracted to with that.
p40
aa(lp41
VBut let's not forget the hair.
p42
aVYou're looking at the image on your left-hand side \u2014
p43
aVthat's my son with his eyebrows present.
p44
aVLook how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing.
p45
aVThere's a definite difference.
p46
aVAnd imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose,
p47
aVhe'd look even odder still.
p48
aa(lp49
VDysmorphophobia
p50
aVis an extreme version
p51
aVof the fact that we don't see ourselves
p52
aVas others see us.
p53
aVIt's a shocking truth
p54
aVthat we only see mirror images of ourselves,
p55
aVand we only see ourselves
p56
aVin freeze-frame photographic images
p57
aVthat capture a mere fraction of the time that we live.
p58
aVDysmorphophobia
p59
aVis a perversion of this
p60
aVwhere people who may be very good looking
p61
aVregard themselves as hideously ugly
p62
aVand are constantly seeking surgery
p63
aVto correct their facial appearance.
p64
aVThey don't need this. They need psychiatric help.
p65
aVMax has kindly donated his photograph to me.
p66
aVHe doesn't have dysmorphophobia, but I'm using his photograph
p67
aVto illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic.
p68
aVIn other words, he looks entirely normal.
p69
aa(lp70
VAge is another thing
p71
aVwhen our attitude toward our appearance changes.
p72
aVSo children judge themselves, learn to judge themselves,
p73
aVby the behavior of adults around them.
p74
aVHere's a classic example: Rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor
p75
aVthat's growing out through her skull, has obliterated her nose,
p76
aVand she's having difficulty seeing.
p77
aVAs you can see, it's blocking her vision.
p78
aVShe's also in danger, when she damages this,
p79
aVof bleeding profusely.
p80
aVOur research has shown
p81
aVthat the parents and close loved ones of these children
p82
aVadore them.
p83
aVThey've grown used to their face; they think they're special.
p84
aVActually, sometimes the parents argue
p85
aVabout whether these children should have the lesion removed.
p86
aVAnd occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions
p87
aVbecause the child they've grown to love
p88
aVhas changed so dramatically and they don't recognize them.
p89
aVBut other adults
p90
aVsay incredibly painful things.
p91
aVThey say, "How dare you take this child out of the house
p92
aVand terrify other people.
p93
aVShouldn't you be doing something about this? Why haven't you had it removed?"
p94
aVAnd other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion,
p95
aVbecause \u2014 a natural curiosity.
p96
aVAnd that obviously alerts the child
p97
aVto their unusual nature.
p98
aVAfter surgery, everything normalizes.
p99
aVThe adults behave more naturally,
p100
aVand the children play more readily with other children.
p101
aa(lp102
VAs teenagers \u2014
p103
aVjust think back to your teenage years \u2014
p104
aVwe're going through a dramatic
p105
aVand often disproportionate change
p106
aVin our facial appearance.
p107
aVWe're trying to struggle to find our identity.
p108
aVWe crave the approval of our peers.
p109
aVSo our facial appearance is vital to us
p110
aVas we're trying to project ourselves to the world.
p111
aVJust remember that single acne spot
p112
aVthat crippled you for several days.
p113
aVHow long did you spend looking in the mirror every day,
p114
aVpracticing your sardonic look, practicing your serious look,
p115
aVtrying to look like Sean Connery, as I did,
p116
aVtrying to raise one eyebrow?
p117
aVIt's a crippling time.
p118
aa(lp119
VI've chosen to show this profile view of Sue
p120
aVbecause what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward
p121
aVand her lower lip jutting forward.
p122
aVI'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward.
p123
aVTurn to the person next to you,
p124
aVpush your lower jaws forward. Turn to the person next to you
p125
aVand look at them \u2014 they look miserable.
p126
aVThat's exactly what people used to say to Sue.
p127
aVShe wasn't miserable at all.
p128
aVBut people used to say to her, "Why are you so miserable?"
p129
aVPeople were making misjudgments all the time
p130
aVon her mood.
p131
aVTeachers and peers were underestimating her; she was teased at school.
p132
aVSo she chose to have facial surgery.
p133
aVAfter the facial surgery,
p134
aVshe said, "My face now reflects my personality.
p135
aVPeople know now that I'm enthusiastic,
p136
aVthat I'm a happy person."
p137
aVAnd that's the change that can be achieved for teenagers.
p138
aa(lp139
VIs this change, though, a real change,
p140
aVor is it a figment of the imagination
p141
aVof the patient themselves?
p142
aVWell we studied teenagers' attitudes
p143
aVto photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery.
p144
aVAnd what we found was \u2014
p145
aVwe jumbled up the photographs
p146
aVso they couldn't recognize the before and after \u2014
p147
aVwhat we found was that the patients were regarded
p148
aVas being more attractive after the surgery.
p149
aVWell that's not surprising, but we also asked them to judge them
p150
aVon honesty, intelligence,
p151
aVfriendliness, violence.
p152
aVThey were all perceived as being
p153
aVless than normal in all those characteristics \u2014
p154
aVmore violent, etc. \u2014 before the surgery.
p155
aVAfter the surgery,
p156
aVthey were perceived as being more intelligent,
p157
aVmore friendly, more honest, less violent \u2014
p158
aVand yet we hadn't operated on their intellect
p159
aVor their character.
p160
aa(lp161
VWhen people get older,
p162
aVthey don't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery.
p163
aVTheir presence in the consultation suite
p164
aVis a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
p165
aVWhat happens to them
p166
aVis that they may have suffered cancer or trauma.
p167
aVSo this is a photograph of Henry,
p168
aVtwo weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed
p169
aVfrom the left side of his face \u2014 his cheekbone,
p170
aVhis upper jaw, his eye-socket.
p171
aVHe looks pretty good at this stage.
p172
aVBut over the course of the next 15 years he had 14 more operations,
p173
aVas the disease ravaged his face
p174
aVand destroyed my reconstruction regularly.
p175
aVI learned a huge amount from Henry.
p176
aVHenry taught me
p177
aVthat you can carry on working.
p178
aVHe worked as an advocate. He continued to play cricket.
p179
aVHe enjoyed life to the full,
p180
aVand this was probably because he had a successful, fulfilling job
p181
aVand a caring family
p182
aVand was able to participate socially.
p183
aVHe maintained a calm insouciance.
p184
aVI don't say he overcame this; he didn't overcome it.
p185
aVThis was something more than that. He ignored it.
p186
aVHe ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life
p187
aVand carried on oblivious to it.
p188
aVAnd that's what these people can do.
p189
aa(lp190
VHenriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well.
p191
aVThis is a man in his 20s
p192
aVwhose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancer
p193
aVthat he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on.
p194
aVIt was my longest operation.
p195
aVIt took 23 hours. I did it with my neurosurgeon.
p196
aVWe removed all the bones at the right side of his face \u2014
p197
aVhis eye, his nose,
p198
aVthe skull bones, the facial skin \u2014
p199
aVand reconstructed him with tissue from the back.
p200
aVHe continued to work as a psychiatric nurse.
p201
aVHe got married. He had a son called Jeremiah.
p202
aVAnd again, he said,
p203
aV"This painting of me with my son Jeremiah
p204
aVshows me as the successful man that I feel that I am."
p205
aVHis facial disfigurement
p206
aVdid not affect him
p207
aVbecause he had the support of a family;
p208
aVhe had a successful, fulfilling job.
p209
aa(lp210
VSo we've seen that we can change people's faces.
p211
aVBut when we change people's faces,
p212
aVare we changing their identity \u2014
p213
aVfor better or for worse?
p214
aVFor instance,
p215
aVthere are two different types of facial surgery.
p216
aVWe can categorize it like that.
p217
aVWe can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery \u2014
p218
aVlike Sue.
p219
aVWhen they have facial surgery,
p220
aVthey feel their lives have changed
p221
aVbecause other people perceive them
p222
aVas better people.
p223
aVThey don't feel different.
p224
aVThey feel that they've actually gained
p225
aVwhat they never had,
p226
aVthat their face now reflects their personality.
p227
aVAnd actually that's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery
p228
aVand this kind of surgery.
p229
aVBecause you might say, "Well, this type of surgery
p230
aVmight be regarded as cosmetic."
p231
aVIf you do cosmetic surgery, patients are often less happy.
p232
aVThey're trying to achieve difference in their lives.
p233
aVSue wasn't trying to achieve difference in her life.
p234
aVShe was just trying to achieve the face
p235
aVthat matched her personality.
p236
aa(lp237
VBut then we have other people
p238
aVwho don't choose to have facial surgery.
p239
aVThey're people who have their face shot off.
p240
aVI'll move it off, and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you.
p241
aVThey have it forced upon them.
p242
aVAnd again, as I told you,
p243
aVif they have a caring family
p244
aVand good work life,
p245
aVthen they can lead normal and fulfilled lives.
p246
aVTheir identity doesn't change.
p247
aa(lp248
VIs this business
p249
aVabout appearance and preoccupation with it
p250
aVa Western phenomenon?
p251
aVMuzetta's family give the lie to this.
p252
aVThis is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London
p253
aVwho's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face,
p254
aVwhich has already made her blind
p255
aVand which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly.
p256
aVAfter she had surgery to remove the tumor,
p257
aVher parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress,
p258
aVa pink ribbon in her hair,
p259
aVand they wanted the painting to be shown around the world,
p260
aVdespite the fact that they were orthodox Muslims
p261
aVand the mother wore a full burqa.
p262
aVSo it's not simply a Western phenomenon.
p263
aa(lp264
VWe make judgments on people's faces
p265
aVall the time.
p266
aVIt's been going on since we can think of Lombroso
p267
aVand the way he would define criminal faces.
p268
aVHe said you could see criminal faces,
p269
aVjudging them just on the photographs that were showed.
p270
aVGood-looking people
p271
aVare always judged as being more friendly.
p272
aVWe look at O.J. \u2014
p273
aVhe's a good-looking guy.
p274
aVWe'd like to spend time with him. He looks friendly.
p275
aVNow we know that he's a convicted wife-batterer,
p276
aVand actually he's not the good guy.
p277
aVAnd beauty doesn't equate to goodness,
p278
aVand certainly doesn't equate to contentment.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo we've talked about the static face
p281
aVand judging the static face,
p282
aVbut actually, we're more comfortable
p283
aVwith judging the moving face.
p284
aVWe think we can judge people on their expressions.
p285
aVU.K. jurors in the U.K. justice system
p286
aVlike to see a live witness
p287
aVto see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity \u2014
p288
aVthe blink, the hesitation.
p289
aVAnd so they want to see live witnesses.
p290
aVTodorov tells us that, in a tenth of a second,
p291
aVwe can make a judgment on somebody's face.
p292
aVAre we uncomfortable with this image? Yes, we are.
p293
aVWould we be happy if our doctor's face, our lawyer's face,
p294
aVour financial adviser's face was covered?
p295
aVWe'd be pretty uncomfortable.
p296
aVBut are we good at making the judgments
p297
aVon facial appearance and movement?
p298
aVThe truth is that there's a five-minute rule,
p299
aVnot the tenth-of-a-second rule like Todorov, but a five-minute rule.
p300
aVIf you spend five minutes with somebody,
p301
aVyou start looking beyond their facial appearance,
p302
aVand the people who you're initially attracted to
p303
aVmay seem boring and you lose interest in them,
p304
aVand the people who you didn't immediately seek out,
p305
aVbecause you didn't find them particularly attractive,
p306
aVbecome attractive people
p307
aVbecause of their personality.
p308
aa(lp309
VSo we've talked a lot about facial appearance.
p310
aVI now want to share
p311
aVa little bit of the surgery that we do \u2014
p312
aVwhere we're at and where we're going.
p313
aVThis is an image of Ann
p314
aVwho's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed.
p315
aVAnd you can see in the images afterward,
p316
aVwe've managed to reconstruct her successfully.
p317
aVBut that's not good enough.
p318
aVThis is what Ann wants. She wants to be out kayaking,
p319
aVshe wants to be out climbing mountains.
p320
aVAnd that's what she achieved, and that's what we have to get to.
p321
aa(lp322
VThis is a horrific image,
p323
aVso I'm putting my hand up now.
p324
aVThis is a photograph of Adi,
p325
aVa Nigerian bank manager who had his face shot off
p326
aVin an armed robbery.
p327
aVAnd he lost his lower jaw, his lip, his chin
p328
aVand his upper jaw and teeth.
p329
aVThis is the bar that he set for us.
p330
aV"I want to look like this. This is how I looked before."
p331
aVSo with modern technology,
p332
aVwe used computers to make models.
p333
aVWe made a model of the jaw without bone in it.
p334
aVWe then bent a plate up to it.
p335
aVWe put it in place
p336
aVso we knew it was an accurate position.
p337
aVWe then put bone and tissue from the back.
p338
aVHere you can see the plate holding it,
p339
aVand you can see the implants being put in \u2014
p340
aVso that in one operation
p341
aVwe achieve this
p342
aVand this.
p343
aVSo the patient's life is restored.
p344
aVThat's the good news.
p345
aVHowever, his chin skin
p346
aVdoesn't look the same as it did before.
p347
aVIt's skin from his back.
p348
aVIt's thicker, it's darker, it's coarser, it doesn't have the contours.
p349
aVAnd that's where we're failing,
p350
aVand that's where we need the face transplant.
p351
aa(lp352
VThe face transplant has a role
p353
aVprobably in burns patients to replace the skin.
p354
aVWe can replace the underlying skeletal structure,
p355
aVbut we're still not good at replacing the facial skin.
p356
aVSo it's very valuable
p357
aVto have that tool in our armamentarium.
p358
aVBut the patients are going to have to take drugs
p359
aVthat suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives.
p360
aVWhat does that mean?
p361
aVThey have an increased risk of infection, an increased risk of malignancy.
p362
aVThis is not a life-saving transplant \u2014
p363
aVlike a heart, or liver, or lung transplant \u2014
p364
aVit is a quality-of-life transplant,
p365
aVand as a result,
p366
aVare the patients going to say, if they get a malignant cancer 10 or 15 years on,
p367
aV"I wish I'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this
p368
aVbecause I'm now dying of a malignant cancer"? We don't know yet.
p369
aVWe also don't know what they feel
p370
aVabout recognition and identity.
p371
aVBernard Devauchelle and Sylvie Testelin, who did the first operation,
p372
aVare studying that.
p373
aVDonors are going to be short on the ground,
p374
aVbecause how many people want to have their loved one's face
p375
aVremoved at the point of death?
p376
aVSo there are going to be problems
p377
aVwith face transplantation.
p378
aa(lp379
VSo the better news is
p380
aVthe future's almost here \u2014
p381
aVand the future is tissue engineering.
p382
aVJust imagine,
p383
aVI can make a biologically-degradable template.
p384
aVI can put it in place where it's meant to be.
p385
aVI can sprinkle a few cells,
p386
aVstem cells from the patient's own hip,
p387
aVa little bit of genetically engineered protein,
p388
aVand lo and behold, leave it for four months and the face is grown.
p389
aVThis is a bit like a Julia Child recipe.
p390
aa(lp391
VBut we've still got problems.
p392
aVWe've got mouth cancer to solve.
p393
aVWe're still not curing enough patients \u2014 it's the most disfiguring cancer.
p394
aVWe're still not reconstructing them well enough.
p395
aVIn the U.K. we have an epidemic
p396
aVof facial injuries among young people.
p397
aVWe still can't get rid of scars.
p398
aVWe need to do research.
p399
aVAnd the best news of all
p400
aVis that surgeons know
p401
aVthat we need to do research.
p402
aVAnd we've set up charities
p403
aVthat will help us fund
p404
aVthe clinical research
p405
aVto determine the best treatment practice now
p406
aVand better treatment into the future,
p407
aVso we don't just sit on our laurels and say, "Okay, we're doing okay.
p408
aVLet's leave it as it is."
p409
