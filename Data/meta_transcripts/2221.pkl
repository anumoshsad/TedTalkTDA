(lp3
VPeople back home call me a heckler,
p4
aVa troublemaker, an irritant,
p5
aVa rebel, an activist,
p6
aVthe voice of the people.
p7
aVBut that wasn't always me.
p8
aa(lp9
VGrowing up, I had a nickname.
p10
aVThey used to call me Softy,
p11
aVmeaning the soft, harmless boy.
p12
aVLike every other human being, I avoided trouble.
p13
aVIn my childhood, they taught me silence.
p14
aVDon't argue, do as you're told.
p15
aVIn Sunday school, they taught me don't confront, don't argue,
p16
aVeven if you're right, turn the other cheek.
p17
aa(lp18
VThis was reinforced by the political climate of the time.
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aVKenya is a country where you are guilty
p21
aVuntil proven rich.
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVKenya's poor are five times more likely
p24
aVto be shot dead by the police who are meant to protect them
p25
aVthan by criminals.
p26
aVThis was reinforced by the political climate of the day.
p27
aVWe had a president, Moi, who was a dictator.
p28
aVHe ruled the country with an iron fist,
p29
aVand anyone who dared question his authority
p30
aVwas arrested, tortured, jailed or even killed.
p31
aVThat meant that people were taught to be smart cowards, stay out of trouble.
p32
aVBeing a coward was not an insult.
p33
aVBeing a coward was a compliment.
p34
aVWe used to be told that a coward goes home to his mother.
p35
aVWhat that meant: that if you stayed out of trouble you're going to stay alive.
p36
aa(lp37
VI used to question this advice,
p38
aVand eight years ago we had an election in Kenya,
p39
aVand the results were violently disputed.
p40
aVWhat followed that election was terrible violence, rape,
p41
aVand the killing of over 1,000 people.
p42
aVMy work was to document the violence.
p43
aVAs a photographer, I took thousands of images,
p44
aVand after two months,
p45
aVthe two politicians came together, had a cup of tea,
p46
aVsigned a peace agreement, and the country moved on.
p47
aa(lp48
VI was a very disturbed man because I saw the violence firsthand.
p49
aVI saw the killings. I saw the displacement.
p50
aVI met women who had been raped, and it disturbed me,
p51
aVbut the country never spoke about it.
p52
aVWe pretended. We all became smart cowards.
p53
aVWe decided to stay out of trouble and not talk about it.
p54
aa(lp55
VTen months later, I quit my job. I said I could not stand it anymore.
p56
aVAfter quitting my job, I decided to organize my friends
p57
aVto speak about the violence in the country,
p58
aVto speak about the state of the nation,
p59
aVand June 1, 2009 was the day that we were meant to go to the stadium
p60
aVand try and get the president's attention.
p61
aVIt's a national holiday,
p62
aVit's broadcast across the country,
p63
aVand I showed up at the stadium.
p64
aVMy friends did not show up.
p65
aVI found myself alone,
p66
aVand I didn't know what to do.
p67
aVI was scared,
p68
aVbut I knew very well that that particular day,
p69
aVI had to make a decision.
p70
aVWas I able to live as a coward, like everyone else,
p71
aVor was I going to make a stand?
p72
aVAnd when the president stood up to speak,
p73
aVI found myself on my feet shouting at the president,
p74
aVtelling him to remember the post-election violence victims,
p75
aVto stop the corruption.
p76
aVAnd suddenly, out of nowhere,
p77
aVthe police pounced on me like hungry lions.
p78
aVThey held my mouth
p79
aVand dragged me out of the stadium,
p80
aVwhere they thoroughly beat me up and locked me up in jail.
p81
aVI spent that night in a cold cement floor in the jail,
p82
aVand that got me thinking.
p83
aVWhat was making me feel this way?
p84
aVMy friends and family thought I was crazy because of what I did,
p85
aVand the images that I took were disturbing my life.
p86
aVThe images that I took were just a number to many Kenyans.
p87
aVMost Kenyans did not see the violence.
p88
aVIt was a story to them.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd so I decided to actually start a street exhibition
p91
aVto show the images of the violence across the country
p92
aVand get people talking about it.
p93
aVWe traveled the country and showed the images,
p94
aVand this was a journey that has started me to the activist path,
p95
aVwhere I decided to become silent no more,
p96
aVto talk about those things.
p97
aVWe traveled, and our general site from our street exhibit
p98
aVbecame for political graffiti about the situation in the country,
p99
aVtalking about corruption, bad leadership.
p100
aVWe have even done symbolic burials.
p101
aVWe have delivered live pigs to Kenya's parliament
p102
aVas a symbol of our politicians' greed.
p103
aVIt has been done in Uganda and other countries,
p104
aVand what is most powerful is that the images have been picked by the media
p105
aVand amplified across the country, across the continent.
p106
aa(lp107
VWhere I used to stand up alone seven years ago,
p108
aVnow I belong to a community of many people who stand up with me.
p109
aVI am no longer alone when I stand up to speak about these things.
p110
aVI belong to a group of young people who are passionate about the country,
p111
aVwho want to bring about change,
p112
aVand they're no longer afraid, and they're no longer smart cowards.
p113
aVSo that was my story.
p114
aVThat day in the stadium,
p115
aVI stood up as a smart coward.
p116
aVBy that one action, I said goodbye to the 24 years living as a coward.
p117
aa(lp118
VThere are two most powerful days in your life:
p119
aVthe day you're born, and the day you discover why.
p120
aVThat day standing up in that stadium shouting at the President,
p121
aVI discovered why I was truly born,
p122
aVthat I would no longer be silent in the face of injustice.
p123
aVDo you know why you were born?
p124
aVThank you.
p125
aV(Applause)
p126
aa(lp127
VTom Rielly: It's an amazing story.
p128
aVI just want to ask you a couple quick questions.
p129
aVSo PAWA254:
p130
aVyou've created a studio, a place where young people can go
p131
aVand harness the power of digital media
p132
aVto do some of this action.
p133
aVWhat's happening now with PAWA?
p134
aa(lp135
VBoniface Mwangi: So we have  this community of filmmakers,
p136
aVgraffiti artists, musicians, and when there's an issue in the country,
p137
aVwe come together, we brainstorm, and take up on that issue.
p138
aVSo our most powerful tool is art,
p139
aVbecause we live in a very busy world where people are so busy in their life,
p140
aVand they don't have time to read.
p141
aVSo we package our activism and we package our message in art.
p142
aVSo from the music, the graffiti,  the art, that's what we do.
p143
aVCan I say one more thing?
p144
aa(lp145
VTR: Yeah, of course. (Applause)
p146
aa(lp147
VBM: In spite of being arrested, beaten up, threatened,
p148
aVthe moment I discovered my voice,
p149
aVthat I could actually stand up for what I really believed in,
p150
aVI'm no longer afraid.
p151
aVI used to be called softy, but I'm no longer softy,
p152
aVbecause I discovered who I really am, as in, that's what I want to do,
p153
aVand there's such beauty in doing that.
p154
aVThere's nothing as powerful as that, knowing that I'm meant to do this,
p155
aVbecause you don't get scared, you just continue living your life.
p156
aa(lp157
VThank you.
