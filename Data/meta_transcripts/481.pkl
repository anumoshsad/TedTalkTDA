VI've been intrigued by this question
p4
aVof whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense \u2014
p5
aVa sense that would give us seamless access
p6
aVand easy access to meta-information or information that may exist somewhere
p7
aVthat may be relevant to help us make the right decision
p8
aVabout whatever it is that we're coming across.
p9
aVAnd some of you may argue,
p10
aV"Well, don't today's cell phones do that already?"
p11
aVBut I would say no.
p12
aVWhen you meet someone here at TED \u2014
p13
aVand this is the top networking place, of course, of the year \u2014
p14
aVyou don't shake somebody's hand
p15
aVand then say, "Can you hold on for a moment
p16
aVwhile I take out my phone and Google you?"
p17
aVOr when you go to the supermarket
p18
aVand you're standing there in that huge aisle
p19
aVof different types of toilet papers,
p20
aVyou don't take out your cell phone, and open a browser,
p21
aVand go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers
p22
aVis the most ecologically responsible purchase to make.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo we don't really have easy access to all this relevant information
p25
aVthat can just help us make optimal decisions
p26
aVabout what to do next and what actions to take.
p27
aVAnd so my research group at the Media Lab
p28
aVhas been developing a series of inventions
p29
aVto give us access to this information in a sort of easy way,
p30
aVwithout requiring that the user changes any of their behavior.
p31
aVAnd I'm here to unveil our latest effort,
p32
aVand most successful effort so far,
p33
aVwhich is still very much a work in process.
p34
aVI'm actually wearing the device right now and we've sort of cobbled it together
p35
aVwith components that are off the shelf \u2014
p36
aVand that, by the way, only cost 350 dollars at this point in time.
p37
aa(lp38
VI'm wearing a camera, just a simple web cam,
p39
aVa portable, battery-powered projection system with a little mirror.
p40
aVThese components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket
p41
aVwhich acts as the communication and computation device.
p42
aVAnd in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry,
p43
aVwho's really the genius who's been implementing
p44
aVand designing this whole system.
p45
aVAnd we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface
p46
aVand start using his hands to interact with the information
p47
aVthat is projected in front of him.
p48
aVThe system tracks the four significant fingers.
p49
aVIn this case, he's wearing simple marker caps
p50
aVthat you may recognize.
p51
aVBut if you want a more stylish version,
p52
aVyou could also paint your nails in different colors.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd the camera basically tracks these four fingers
p55
aVand recognizes any gestures that he's making
p56
aVso he can just go to, for example, a map of Long Beach,
p57
aVzoom in and out, etc.
p58
aVThe system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the "take a picture" gesture,
p59
aVand then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you.
p60
aVAnd when he then walks back to the Media Lab,
p61
aVhe can just go up to any wall
p62
aVand project all the pictures that he's taken,
p63
aVsort through them and organize them, and re-size them, etc.,
p64
aVagain using all natural gestures.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo, some of you most likely were here two years ago
p67
aVand saw the demo by Jeff Han, or some of you may think,
p68
aV"Well, doesn't this look like the Microsoft Surface Table?"
p69
aVAnd yes, you also interact using natural gestures,
p70
aVboth hands, etc.
p71
aVBut the difference here is that you can use any surface,
p72
aVyou can walk up to any surface,
p73
aVincluding your hand, if nothing else is available,
p74
aVand interact with this projected data.
p75
aVThe device is completely portable, and can be \u2014
p76
aa(lp77
V(Applause)
p78
aa(lp79
V(Applause ends)
p80
aa(lp81
VSo, one important difference is that it's totally mobile.
p82
aVAnother even more important difference is that in mass production,
p83
aVthis would not cost more tomorrow than today's cell phones
p84
aVand would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging \u2014
p85
aVcould look a lot more stylish
p86
aVthan this version that I'm wearing around my neck.
p87
aVBut other than letting some of you live out your fantasy
p88
aVof looking as cool as Tom Cruise in "Minority Report,"
p89
aVthe reason why we're really excited about this device
p90
aVis that it really can act as one of these sixth-sense devices
p91
aVthat gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you.
p92
aVSo we see Pranav here going into the supermarket
p93
aVand he's shopping for some paper towels.
p94
aVAnd, as he picks up a product,
p95
aVthe system can recognize the product that he's picking up,
p96
aVusing either image recognition or marker technology,
p97
aVand give him the green light or an orange light.
p98
aVHe can ask for additional information.
p99
aVSo this particular choice here
p100
aVis a particularly good choice, given his personal criteria.
p101
aVSome of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it
p102
aVrather than the most ecologically responsible choice.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VIf he picks up a book in the bookstore, he can get an Amazon rating \u2014
p107
aVit gets projected right on the cover of the book.
p108
aVThis is Juan's book, our previous speaker,
p109
aVwhich gets a great rating, by the way, at Amazon.
p110
aVAnd so, Pranav turns the page of the book
p111
aVand can then see additional information about the book \u2014
p112
aVreader comments, maybe sort of information by his favorite critic, etc.
p113
aVIf he turns to a particular page,
p114
aVhe finds an annotation by maybe an expert or a friend of ours
p115
aVthat gives him a little bit of additional information
p116
aVabout whatever is on that particular page.
p117
aVReading the newspaper \u2014 it never has to be outdated.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VYou can get video annotations of the events that you're reading about.
p122
aVYou can get the latest sports scores, etc.
p123
aVThis is a more controversial one.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VAs you interact with someone at TED,
p128
aVmaybe you can see a word cloud of the tags,
p129
aVthe words that are associated with that person
p130
aVin their blog and personal web pages.
p131
aVIn this case, the student is interested in cameras, etc.
p132
aVOn your way to the airport,
p133
aVif you pick up your boarding pass, it can tell you that your flight is delayed,
p134
aVthat the gate has changed, etc.
p135
aVAnd, if you need to know what the current time is,
p136
aVit's as simple as drawing a watch \u2014
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
V(Applause)
p141
aa(lp142
Von your arm.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo that's where we're at so far in developing this sixth sense
p145
aVthat would give us seamless access to all this relevant information
p146
aVabout the things that we may come across.
p147
aVMy student Pranav, who's really, like I said, the genius behind this.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Applause and cheering)
p150
aa(lp151
V(Applause ends)
p152
aa(lp153
VHe does deserve a lot of applause,
p154
aVbecause I don't think he's slept much in the last three months, actually.
p155
aVAnd his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either.
p156
aVBut it's not perfect yet, it's very much a work in progress.
p157
aVAnd who knows, maybe in another 10 years
p158
aVwe'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant.
p159
aa(lp160
VThank you.
