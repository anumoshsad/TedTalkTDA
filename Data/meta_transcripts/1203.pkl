VEach of you possesses
p4
aVthe most powerful, dangerous and subversive trait
p5
aVthat natural selection has ever devised.
p6
aVIt's a piece of neural audio technology
p7
aVfor rewiring other people's minds.
p8
aVI'm talking about your language, of course,
p9
aVbecause it allows you to implant a thought from your mind
p10
aVdirectly into someone else's mind,
p11
aVand they can attempt to do the same to you,
p12
aVwithout either of you having to perform surgery.
p13
aVInstead, when you speak,
p14
aVyou're actually using a form of telemetry
p15
aVnot so different
p16
aVfrom the remote control device for your television.
p17
aVIt's just that, whereas that device
p18
aVrelies on pulses of infrared light,
p19
aVyour language relies on pulses,
p20
aVdiscrete pulses, of sound.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd just as you use the remote control device
p23
aVto alter the internal settings of your television
p24
aVto suit your mood,
p25
aVyou use your language
p26
aVto alter the settings inside someone else's brain
p27
aVto suit your interests.
p28
aVLanguages are genes talking,
p29
aVgetting things that they want.
p30
aVAnd just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby
p31
aVwhen it first discovers that, merely by uttering a sound,
p32
aVit can get objects to move across a room
p33
aVas if by magic,
p34
aVand maybe even into its mouth.
p35
aa(lp36
VNow language's subversive power
p37
aVhas been recognized throughout the ages
p38
aVin censorship, in books you can't read,
p39
aVphrases you can't use
p40
aVand words you can't say.
p41
aVIn fact, the Tower of Babel story in the Bible
p42
aVis a fable and warning
p43
aVabout the power of language.
p44
aVAccording to that story, early humans developed the conceit
p45
aVthat, by using their language to work together,
p46
aVthey could build a tower
p47
aVthat would take them all the way to heaven.
p48
aVNow God, angered at this attempt to usurp his power,
p49
aVdestroyed the tower,
p50
aVand then to ensure
p51
aVthat it would never be rebuilt,
p52
aVhe scattered the people by giving them different languages \u2014
p53
aVconfused them by giving them different languages.
p54
aVAnd this leads to the wonderful irony
p55
aVthat our languages exist to prevent us from communicating.
p56
aVEven today,
p57
aVwe know that there are words we cannot use,
p58
aVphrases we cannot say,
p59
aVbecause if we do so,
p60
aVwe might be accosted, jailed,
p61
aVor even killed.
p62
aVAnd all of this from a puff of air
p63
aVemanating from our mouths.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow all this fuss about a single one of our traits
p66
aVtells us there's something worth explaining.
p67
aVAnd that is how and why
p68
aVdid this remarkable trait evolve,
p69
aVand why did it evolve
p70
aVonly in our species?
p71
aVNow it's a little bit of a surprise
p72
aVthat to get an answer to that question,
p73
aVwe have to go to tool use
p74
aVin the chimpanzees.
p75
aVNow these chimpanzees are using tools,
p76
aVand we take that as a sign of their intelligence.
p77
aVBut if they really were intelligent,
p78
aVwhy would they use a stick to extract termites from the ground
p79
aVrather than a shovel?
p80
aVAnd if they really were intelligent,
p81
aVwhy would they crack open nuts with a rock?
p82
aVWhy wouldn't they just go to a shop and buy a bag of nuts
p83
aVthat somebody else had already cracked open for them?
p84
aVWhy not? I mean, that's what we do.
p85
aa(lp86
VNow the reason the chimpanzees don't do that
p87
aVis that they lack what psychologists and anthropologists call
p88
aVsocial learning.
p89
aVThey seem to lack the ability
p90
aVto learn from others
p91
aVby copying or imitating
p92
aVor simply watching.
p93
aVAs a result,
p94
aVthey can't improve on others' ideas
p95
aVor learn from others' mistakes \u2014
p96
aVbenefit from others' wisdom.
p97
aVAnd so they just do the same thing
p98
aVover and over and over again.
p99
aVIn fact, we could go away for a million years and come back
p100
aVand these chimpanzees would be doing the same thing
p101
aVwith the same sticks for the termites
p102
aVand the same rocks to crack open the nuts.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow this may sound arrogant, or even full of hubris.
p105
aVHow do we know this?
p106
aVBecause this is exactly what our ancestors, the Homo erectus, did.
p107
aVThese upright apes
p108
aVevolved on the African savanna
p109
aVabout two million years ago,
p110
aVand they made these splendid hand axes
p111
aVthat fit wonderfully into your hands.
p112
aVBut if we look at the fossil record,
p113
aVwe see that they made the same hand axe
p114
aVover and over and over again
p115
aVfor one million years.
p116
aVYou can follow it through the fossil record.
p117
aVNow if we make some guesses about how long Homo erectus lived,
p118
aVwhat their generation time was,
p119
aVthat's about 40,000 generations
p120
aVof parents to offspring, and other individuals watching,
p121
aVin which that hand axe didn't change.
p122
aVIt's not even clear
p123
aVthat our very close genetic relatives, the Neanderthals,
p124
aVhad social learning.
p125
aVSure enough, their tools were more complicated
p126
aVthan those of Homo erectus,
p127
aVbut they too showed very little change
p128
aVover the 300,000 years or so
p129
aVthat those species, the Neanderthals,
p130
aVlived in Eurasia.
p131
aa(lp132
VOkay, so what this tells us
p133
aVis that, contrary to the old adage,
p134
aV"monkey see, monkey do,"
p135
aVthe surprise really is
p136
aVthat all of the other animals
p137
aVreally cannot do that \u2014 at least not very much.
p138
aVAnd even this picture
p139
aVhas the suspicious taint of being rigged about it \u2014
p140
aVsomething from a Barnum & Bailey circus.
p141
aa(lp142
VBut by comparison,
p143
aVwe can learn.
p144
aVWe can learn by watching other people
p145
aVand copying or imitating
p146
aVwhat they can do.
p147
aVWe can then choose, from among a range of options,
p148
aVthe best one.
p149
aVWe can benefit from others' ideas.
p150
aVWe can build on their wisdom.
p151
aVAnd as a result, our ideas do accumulate,
p152
aVand our technology progresses.
p153
aVAnd this cumulative cultural adaptation,
p154
aVas anthropologists call
p155
aVthis accumulation of ideas,
p156
aVis responsible for everything around you
p157
aVin your bustling and teeming everyday lives.
p158
aVI mean the world has changed out of all proportion
p159
aVto what we would recognize
p160
aVeven 1,000 or 2,000 years ago.
p161
aVAnd all of this because of cumulative cultural adaptation.
p162
aVThe chairs you're sitting in, the lights in this auditorium,
p163
aVmy microphone, the iPads and iPods that you carry around with you \u2014
p164
aVall are a result
p165
aVof cumulative cultural adaptation.
p166
aa(lp167
VNow to many commentators,
p168
aVcumulative cultural adaptation, or social learning,
p169
aVis job done, end of story.
p170
aVOur species can make stuff,
p171
aVtherefore we prospered in a way that no other species has.
p172
aVIn fact, we can even make the "stuff of life" \u2014
p173
aVas I just said, all the stuff around us.
p174
aVBut in fact, it turns out
p175
aVthat some time around 200,000 years ago,
p176
aVwhen our species first arose
p177
aVand acquired social learning,
p178
aVthat this was really the beginning of our story,
p179
aVnot the end of our story.
p180
aVBecause our acquisition of social learning
p181
aVwould create a social and evolutionary dilemma,
p182
aVthe resolution of which, it's fair to say,
p183
aVwould determine not only the future course of our psychology,
p184
aVbut the future course of the entire world.
p185
aVAnd most importantly for this,
p186
aVit'll tell us why we have language.
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd the reason that dilemma arose
p189
aVis, it turns out, that social learning is visual theft.
p190
aVIf I can learn by watching you,
p191
aVI can steal your best ideas,
p192
aVand I can benefit from your efforts,
p193
aVwithout having to put in the time and energy that you did
p194
aVinto developing them.
p195
aVIf I can watch which lure you use to catch a fish,
p196
aVor I can watch how you flake your hand axe
p197
aVto make it better,
p198
aVor if I follow you secretly to your mushroom patch,
p199
aVI can benefit from your knowledge and wisdom and skills,
p200
aVand maybe even catch that fish
p201
aVbefore you do.
p202
aVSocial learning really is visual theft.
p203
aVAnd in any species that acquired it,
p204
aVit would behoove you
p205
aVto hide your best ideas,
p206
aVlest somebody steal them from you.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd so some time around 200,000 years ago,
p209
aVour species confronted this crisis.
p210
aVAnd we really had only two options
p211
aVfor dealing with the conflicts
p212
aVthat visual theft would bring.
p213
aVOne of those options
p214
aVwas that we could have retreated
p215
aVinto small family groups.
p216
aVBecause then the benefits of our ideas and knowledge
p217
aVwould flow just to our relatives.
p218
aVHad we chosen this option,
p219
aVsometime around 200,000 years ago,
p220
aVwe would probably still be living like the Neanderthals were
p221
aVwhen we first entered Europe 40,000 years ago.
p222
aVAnd this is because in small groups
p223
aVthere are fewer ideas, there are fewer innovations.
p224
aVAnd small groups are more prone to accidents and bad luck.
p225
aVSo if we'd chosen that path,
p226
aVour evolutionary path would have led into the forest \u2014
p227
aVand been a short one indeed.
p228
aa(lp229
VThe other option we could choose
p230
aVwas to develop the systems of communication
p231
aVthat would allow us to share ideas
p232
aVand to cooperate amongst others.
p233
aVChoosing this option would mean
p234
aVthat a vastly greater fund of accumulated knowledge and wisdom
p235
aVwould become available to any one individual
p236
aVthan would ever arise from within an individual family
p237
aVor an individual person on their own.
p238
aVWell, we chose the second option,
p239
aVand language is the result.
p240
aa(lp241
VLanguage evolved to solve the crisis
p242
aVof visual theft.
p243
aVLanguage is a piece of social technology
p244
aVfor enhancing the benefits of cooperation \u2014
p245
aVfor reaching agreements, for striking deals
p246
aVand for coordinating our activities.
p247
aVAnd you can see that, in a developing society
p248
aVthat was beginning to acquire language,
p249
aVnot having language
p250
aVwould be a like a bird without wings.
p251
aVJust as wings open up this sphere of air
p252
aVfor birds to exploit,
p253
aVlanguage opened up the sphere of cooperation
p254
aVfor humans to exploit.
p255
aVAnd we take this utterly for granted,
p256
aVbecause we're a species that is so at home with language,
p257
aa(lp258
Vbut you have to realize
p259
aVthat even the simplest acts of exchange that we engage in
p260
aVare utterly dependent upon language.
p261
aVAnd to see why, consider two scenarios
p262
aVfrom early in our evolution.
p263
aVLet's imagine that you are really good
p264
aVat making arrowheads,
p265
aVbut you're hopeless at making the wooden shafts
p266
aVwith the flight feathers attached.
p267
aVTwo other people you know are very good at making the wooden shafts,
p268
aVbut they're hopeless at making the arrowheads.
p269
aVSo what you do is \u2014
p270
aVone of those people has not really acquired language yet.
p271
aVAnd let's pretend the other one is good at language skills.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads,
p274
aVand you walk up to the one that can't speak very well,
p275
aVand you put the arrowheads down in front of him,
p276
aVhoping that he'll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads
p277
aVfor finished arrows.
p278
aVBut he looks at the pile of arrowheads, thinks they're a gift,
p279
aVpicks them up, smiles and walks off.
p280
aVNow you pursue this guy, gesticulating.
p281
aVA scuffle ensues and you get stabbed
p282
aVwith one of your own arrowheads.
p283
aVOkay, now replay this scene now, and you're approaching the one who has language.
p284
aVYou put down your arrowheads and say,
p285
aV"I'd like to trade these arrowheads for finished arrows. I'll split you 50/50."
p286
aVThe other one says, "Fine. Looks good to me.
p287
aVWe'll do that."
p288
aVNow the job is done.
p289
aa(lp290
VOnce we have language,
p291
aVwe can put our ideas together and cooperate
p292
aVto have a prosperity
p293
aVthat we couldn't have before we acquired it.
p294
aVAnd this is why our species
p295
aVhas prospered around the world
p296
aVwhile the rest of the animals
p297
aVsit behind bars in zoos, languishing.
p298
aVThat's why we build space shuttles and cathedrals
p299
aVwhile the rest of the world sticks sticks into the ground
p300
aVto extract termites.
p301
aVAll right, if this view of language
p302
aVand its value
p303
aVin solving the crisis of visual theft is true,
p304
aVany species that acquires it
p305
aVshould show an explosion of creativity and prosperity.
p306
aVAnd this is exactly what the archeological record shows.
p307
aa(lp308
VIf you look at our ancestors,
p309
aVthe Neanderthals and the Homo erectus, our immediate ancestors,
p310
aVthey're confined to small regions of the world.
p311
aVBut when our species arose
p312
aVabout 200,000 years ago,
p313
aVsometime after that we quickly walked out of Africa
p314
aVand spread around the entire world,
p315
aVoccupying nearly every habitat on Earth.
p316
aVNow whereas other species are confined
p317
aVto places that their genes adapt them to,
p318
aVwith social learning and language,
p319
aVwe could transform the environment
p320
aVto suit our needs.
p321
aVAnd so we prospered in a way
p322
aVthat no other animal has.
p323
aVLanguage really is
p324
aVthe most potent trait that has ever evolved.
p325
aVIt is the most valuable trait we have
p326
aVfor converting new lands and resources
p327
aVinto more people and their genes
p328
aVthat natural selection has ever devised.
p329
aa(lp330
VLanguage really is
p331
aVthe voice of our genes.
p332
aVNow having evolved language, though,
p333
aVwe did something peculiar,
p334
aVeven bizarre.
p335
aVAs we spread out around the world,
p336
aVwe developed thousands of different languages.
p337
aVCurrently, there are about seven or 8,000
p338
aVdifferent languages spoken on Earth.
p339
aVNow you might say, well, this is just natural.
p340
aVAs we diverge, our languages are naturally going to diverge.
p341
aVBut the real puzzle and irony
p342
aVis that the greatest density of different languages on Earth
p343
aVis found where people are most tightly packed together.
p344
aa(lp345
VIf we go to the island of Papua New Guinea,
p346
aVwe can find about 800 to 1,000
p347
aVdistinct human languages,
p348
aVdifferent human languages,
p349
aVspoken on that island alone.
p350
aVThere are places on that island
p351
aVwhere you can encounter a new language
p352
aVevery two or three miles.
p353
aVNow, incredible as this sounds,
p354
aVI once met a Papuan man, and I asked him if this could possibly be true.
p355
aVAnd he said to me, "Oh no.
p356
aVThey're far closer together than that."
p357
aVAnd it's true; there are places on that island
p358
aVwhere you can encounter a new language in under a mile.
p359
aVAnd this is also true of some remote oceanic islands.
p360
aa(lp361
VAnd so it seems that we use our language,
p362
aVnot just to cooperate,
p363
aVbut to draw rings around our cooperative groups
p364
aVand to establish identities,
p365
aVand perhaps to protect our knowledge and wisdom and skills
p366
aVfrom eavesdropping from outside.
p367
aVAnd we know this
p368
aVbecause when we study different language groups
p369
aVand associate them with their cultures,
p370
aVwe see that different languages
p371
aVslow the flow of ideas between groups.
p372
aVThey slow the flow of technologies.
p373
aVAnd they even slow the flow of genes.
p374
aVNow I can't speak for you,
p375
aVbut it seems to be the case
p376
aVthat we don't have sex with people we can't talk to.
p377
aV(Laughter)
p378
aVNow we have to counter that, though,
p379
aVagainst the evidence we've heard
p380
aVthat we might have had some rather distasteful genetic dalliances
p381
aVwith the Neanderthals and the Denisovans.
p382
aa(lp383
V(Laughter)
p384
aa(lp385
VOkay, this tendency we have,
p386
aVthis seemingly natural tendency we have,
p387
aVtowards isolation, towards keeping to ourselves,
p388
aVcrashes head first into our modern world.
p389
aVThis remarkable image
p390
aVis not a map of the world.
p391
aVIn fact, it's a map of Facebook friendship links.
p392
aVAnd when you plot those friendship links
p393
aVby their latitude and longitude,
p394
aVit literally draws a map of the world.
p395
aVOur modern world is communicating
p396
aVwith itself and with each other
p397
aVmore than it has
p398
aVat any time in its past.
p399
aVAnd that communication, that connectivity around the world,
p400
aVthat globalization
p401
aVnow raises a burden.
p402
aVBecause these different languages
p403
aVimpose a barrier, as we've just seen,
p404
aVto the transfer of goods and ideas
p405
aVand technologies and wisdom.
p406
aVAnd they impose a barrier to cooperation.
p407
aa(lp408
VAnd nowhere do we see that more clearly
p409
aVthan in the European Union,
p410
aVwhose 27 member countries
p411
aVspeak 23 official languages.
p412
aVThe European Union
p413
aVis now spending over one billion euros annually
p414
aVtranslating among their 23 official languages.
p415
aVThat's something on the order
p416
aVof 1.45 billion U.S. dollars
p417
aVon translation costs alone.
p418
aVNow think of the absurdity of this situation.
p419
aVIf 27 individuals
p420
aVfrom those 27 member states
p421
aVsat around table, speaking their 23 languages,
p422
aVsome very simple mathematics will tell you
p423
aVthat you need an army of 253 translators
p424
aVto anticipate all the pairwise possibilities.
p425
aVThe European Union employs a permanent staff
p426
aVof about 2,500 translators.
p427
aVAnd in 2007 alone \u2014
p428
aVand I'm sure there are more recent figures \u2014
p429
aVsomething on the order of 1.3 million pages
p430
aVwere translated into English alone.
p431
aa(lp432
VAnd so if language really is
p433
aVthe solution to the crisis of visual theft,
p434
aVif language really is
p435
aVthe conduit of our cooperation,
p436
aVthe technology that our species derived
p437
aVto promote the free flow and exchange of ideas,
p438
aVin our modern world,
p439
aVwe confront a question.
p440
aVAnd that question is whether
p441
aVin this modern, globalized world
p442
aVwe can really afford to have all these different languages.
p443
aa(lp444
VTo put it this way, nature knows no other circumstance
p445
aVin which functionally equivalent traits coexist.
p446
aVOne of them always drives the other extinct.
p447
aVAnd we see this in the inexorable march
p448
aVtowards standardization.
p449
aVThere are lots and lots of ways of measuring things \u2014
p450
aVweighing them and measuring their length \u2014
p451
aVbut the metric system is winning.
p452
aVThere are lots and lots of ways of measuring time,
p453
aVbut a really bizarre base 60 system
p454
aVknown as hours and minutes and seconds
p455
aVis nearly universal around the world.
p456
aVThere are many, many ways
p457
aVof imprinting CDs or DVDs,
p458
aVbut those are all being standardized as well.
p459
aVAnd you can probably think of many, many more
p460
aVin your own everyday lives.
p461
aa(lp462
VAnd so our modern world now
p463
aVis confronting us with a dilemma.
p464
aVAnd it's the dilemma
p465
aVthat this Chinese man faces,
p466
aVwho's language is spoken
p467
aVby more people in the world
p468
aVthan any other single language,
p469
aVand yet he is sitting at his blackboard,
p470
aVconverting Chinese phrases
p471
aVinto English language phrases.
p472
aVAnd what this does is it raises the possibility to us
p473
aVthat in a world in which we want to promote
p474
aVcooperation and exchange,
p475
aVand in a world that might be dependent more than ever before
p476
aVon cooperation
p477
aVto maintain and enhance our levels of prosperity,
p478
aVhis actions suggest to us
p479

VMatt Ridley: Mark, one question.
p488
aVSvante found that the FOXP2 gene,
p489
aVwhich seems to be associated with language,
p490
aVwas also shared in the same form
p491
aVin Neanderthals as us.
p492
aVDo we have any idea
p493
aVhow we could have defeated Neanderthals
p494
aVif they also had language?
p495
aa(lp496
VMark Pagel: This is a very good question.
p497
aVSo many of you will be familiar with the idea that there's this gene called FOXP2
p498
aVthat seems to be implicated in some ways
p499
aVin the fine motor control that's associated with language.
p500
aVThe reason why I don't believe that tells us
p501
aVthat the Neanderthals had language
p502
aVis \u2014 here's a simple analogy:
p503
aVFerraris are cars that have engines.
p504
aVMy car has an engine,
p505
aVbut it's not a Ferrari.
p506
aVNow the simple answer then
p507
aVis that genes alone don't, all by themselves,
p508
aVdetermine the outcome
p509
aVof very complicated things like language.
p510
aVWhat we know about this FOXP2 and Neanderthals
p511
aVis that they may have had fine motor control of their mouths \u2014 who knows.
p512
aVBut that doesn't tell us they necessarily had language.
