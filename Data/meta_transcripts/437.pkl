VWhat's happening in genomics,
p4
aVand how this revolution is about to change everything we know
p5
aVabout the world, life, ourselves, and how we think about them.
p6
aa(lp7
VIf you saw 2001: A Space Odyssey,
p8
aVand you heard the boom, boom, boom, boom, and you saw the monolith,
p9
aVyou know, that was Arthur C. Clarke's representation
p10
aVthat we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species.
p11
aVIn this case, it was picking up bones and creating a tool,
p12
aVusing it as a tool, which meant that apes just, sort of,
p13
aVrunning around and eating and doing each other
p14
aVfigured out they can make things if they used a tool.
p15
aVAnd that moved us to the next level.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd, you know, we in the last 30 years in particular
p18
aVhave seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology,
p19
aVand technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools.
p20
aVAnd we've seen many seminal moments.
p21
aVWe've seen the creation of small computers in the '70s and early '80s,
p22
aVand who would have thought back then that every single person
p23
aVwould not have just one computer but probably 20,
p24
aVin your home, and in not just your P.C. but in every device \u2014
p25
aVin your washing machine, your cell phone.
p26
aVYou're walking around; your car has 12 microprocessors.
p27
aVThen we go along and create the Internet
p28
aVand connect the world together; we flatten the world.
p29
aa(lp30
VWe've seen so much change, and we've given ourselves these tools now \u2014
p31
aVthese high-powered tools \u2014
p32
aVthat are allowing us to turn the lens inward
p33
aVinto something that is common to all of us, and that is a genome.
p34
aa(lp35
VHow's your genome today? Have you thought about it lately?
p36
aVHeard about it, at least? You probably hear about genomes these days.
p37
aa(lp38
VI thought I'd take a moment to tell you what a genome is.
p39
aVIt's, sort of, like if you ask people,
p40
aVWell, what is a megabyte or megabit? And what is broadband?
p41
aVPeople never want to say, I really don't understand.
p42
aVSo, I will tell you right off of the bat.
p43
aVYou've heard of DNA; you probably studied a little bit in biology.
p44
aVA genome is really a description for  all of the DNA that is in a living organism.
p45
aVAnd one thing that is common to all of life is DNA.
p46
aVIt doesn't matter whether you're a yeast;
p47
aVit doesn't matter whether you're a mouse;
p48
aVdoesn't matter whether you're a fly; we all have DNA.
p49
aVThe DNA is organized in words, call them: genes and chromosomes.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd when Watson and Crick in the '50s
p52
aVfirst decoded this beautiful double helix that we know as the DNA molecule \u2014
p53
aVvery long, complicated molecule \u2014
p54
aVwe then started on this journey to understand that
p55
aVinside of that DNA is a language that determines the characteristics, our traits,
p56
aVwhat we inherit, what diseases we may get.
p57
aVWe've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule,
p58
aVthat all of the DNA in your body has been around forever,
p59
aVsince the beginning of us, of us as creatures.
p60
aVThere is a historical archive.
p61
aa(lp62
VLiving in your genome is the history of our species,
p63
aVand you as an individual human being, where you're from,
p64
aVgoing back thousands and thousands and thousands of years,
p65
aVand that's now starting to be understood.
p66
aVBut also, the genome is really the instruction manual.
p67
aVIt is the program. It is the code of life.
p68
aVIt is what makes you function;
p69
aVit is what makes every organism function.
p70
aVDNA is a very elegant molecule.
p71
aVIt's long and it's complicated.
p72
aVReally all you have to know about it is that there's four letters:
p73
aVA, T, C, G; they represent the name of a chemical.
p74
aVAnd with these four letters, you can create a language:
p75
aVa language that can describe anything, and very complicated things.
p76
aVYou know, they are generally put together in pairs,
p77
aVcreating a word or what we call base pairs.
p78
aVAnd you would, you know, when you think about it,
p79
aVfour letters, or the representation of four things, makes us work.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd that may not sound very intuitive,
p82
aVbut let me flip over to something else you know about, and that's computers.
p83
aVLook at this screen here and, you know, you see pictures
p84
aVand you see words, but really all there are are ones and zeros.
p85
aVThe language of technology is binary;
p86
aVyou've probably heard that at some point in time.
p87
aVEverything that happens in digital is converted,
p88
aVor a representation, of a one and a zero.
p89
aVSo, when you're listening to iTunes and your favorite music,
p90
aVthat's really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly.
p91
aVWhen you're seeing these pictures, it's all ones and zeros,
p92
aVand when you're talking on your telephone, your cell phone,
p93
aVand it's going over the network,
p94
aVyour voice is all being turned into ones and zeros and magically whizzed around.
p95
aVAnd look at all the complex things and wonderful things
p96
aVwe've been able to create with just a one and a zero.
p97
aa(lp98
VWell, now you ramp that up to four, and you have a lot of complexity,
p99
aVa lot of ways to describe mechanisms.
p100
aVSo, let's talk about what that means.
p101
aVSo, if you look at a human genome,
p102
aVthey consist of 3.2 billion of these base pairs. That's a lot.
p103
aVAnd they mix up in all different fashions,
p104
aVand that makes you a human being.
p105
aVIf you convert that to binary, just to give you a little bit of sizing,
p106
aVwe're actually smaller than the program Microsoft Office.
p107
aVIt's not really all that much data.
p108
aVI will also tell you we're at least as buggy.
p109
aV(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VThis here is a bug in my genome
p112
aVthat I have struggled with for a long, long time.
p113
aVWhen you get sick, it is a bug in your genome.
p114
aVIn fact, many, many diseases we have struggled with for a long time,
p115
aVlike cancer, we haven't been able to cure
p116
aVbecause we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level.
p117
aVWe are starting to understand that.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo, up to this point we tried to fix it
p120
aVby using what I call shit-against-the-wall pharmacology,
p121
aVwhich means, well, let's just throw chemicals at it,
p122
aVand maybe it's going to make it work.
p123
aVBut if you really understand why does a cell go from normal cell to cancer?
p124
aVWhat is the code?
p125
aVWhat are the exact instructions that are making it do that?
p126
aVthen you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out.
p127
aVSo, for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine, here's a few factoids for you.
p128
aa(lp129
VWe actually have about 24,000 genes that do things.
p130
aVWe have about a hundred, 120,000 others
p131
aVthat don't appear to function every day,
p132
aVbut represent this archival history of how we used to work as a species
p133
aVgoing back tens of thousands of years.
p134
aVYou might also be interested in knowing
p135
aVthat a mouse has about the same amount of genes.
p136
aa(lp137
VThey recently sequenced Pinot Noir, and it also has about 30,000 genes,
p138
aVso the number of genes you have may not necessarily represent the complexity
p139
aVor the evolutionary order of any particular species.
p140
aVNow, look around: just look next to your neighbor,
p141
aVlook forward, look backward. We all look pretty different.
p142
aVA lot of very handsome and pretty people here, skinny, chubby,
p143
aVdifferent races, cultures. We are all 99.9% genetically equal.
p144
aVIt is one one-hundredth of one percent of genetic material
p145
aVthat makes the difference between any one of us.
p146
aVThat's a tiny amount of material,
p147
aVbut the way that ultimately expresses itself
p148
aVis what makes changes in humans and in all species.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo, we are now able to read genomes.
p151
aVThe first human genome took 10 years, three billion dollars.
p152
aVIt was done by Dr. Craig Venter.
p153
aVAnd then James Watson's \u2014 one of the co-founders of DNA \u2014
p154
aVgenome was done for two million dollars, and in just two months.
p155
aVAnd if you think about the computer industry
p156
aVand how we've gone from big computers to little ones
p157
aVand how they get more powerful and faster all the time,
p158
aVthe same thing is happening with gene sequencing now:
p159
aVwe are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes
p160
aVfor about 5,000 dollars in about an hour or a half-hour;
p161
aVyou will see that happen in the next five years.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd what that means is, you are going to walk around
p164
aVwith your own personal genome on a smart card. It will be here.
p165
aVAnd when you buy medicine,
p166
aVyou won't be buying a drug that's used for everybody.
p167
aVYou will give your genome to the pharmacist,
p168
aVand your drug will be made for you
p169
aVand it will work much better than the ones that were \u2014
p170
aVyou won't have side effects.
p171
aVAll those side effects, you know, oily residue and, you know,
p172
aVwhatever they say in those commercials: forget about that.
p173
aVThey're going to make all that stuff go away.
p174
aa(lp175
VWhat does a genome look like?
p176
aVWell, there it is. It is a long, long series of these base pairs.
p177
aVIf you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this,
p178
aVbut what scientists are doing now is
p179
aVthey're understanding what these do and what they mean.
p180
aVBecause what Nature is doing is double-clicking all the time.
p181
aVIn other words, the first couple of sentences here,
p182
aVassuming this is a grape plant:
p183
aVmake a root, make a branch, create a blossom.
p184
aVIn a human being, down in here it could be:
p185
aVmake blood cells, start cancer.
p186
aVFor me it may be: every calorie you consume, you conserve,
p187
aVbecause I come from a very cold climate.
p188
aVFor my wife: eat three times as much and you never put on any weight.
p189
aVIt's all hidden in this code,
p190
aVand it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo, what can we do with genomes now that we can read them,
p193
aVnow that we're starting to have the book of life?
p194
aVWell, there's many things. Some are exciting.
p195
aVSome people will find very scary. I will tell you a couple of things
p196
aVthat will probably make you want to projectile puke on me, but that's okay.
p197
aVSo, you know, we now can learn the history of organisms.
p198
aa(lp199
VYou can do a very simple test: scrape your cheek; send it off.
p200
aVYou can find out where your relatives come from;
p201
aVyou can do your genealogy going back thousands of years.
p202
aVWe can understand functionality. This is really important.
p203
aVWe can understand, for example, why we create plaque in our arteries,
p204
aVwhat creates the starchiness inside of a grain,
p205
aVwhy does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide.
p206
aVWe can also look at, at a grander scale, what creates problems,
p207
aVwhat creates disease, and how we may be able to fix them.
p208
aVBecause we can understand this,
p209
aVwe can fix them, make better organisms.
p210
aa(lp211
VMost importantly, what we're learning
p212
aVis that Nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox.
p213
aVThe toolbox exists.
p214
aVAn architect far better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox,
p215
aVand we now have the ability to use it.
p216
aVWe are now not just reading genomes; we are writing them.
p217
aa(lp218
VThis company, Synthetic Genomics, I'm involved with,
p219
aVcreated the first full synthetic genome for a little bug,
p220
aVa very primitive creature called Mycoplasma genitalium.
p221
aVIf you have a UTI, you've probably \u2014 or ever had a UTI \u2014
p222
aVyou've come in contact with this little bug.
p223
aVVery simple \u2014 only has about 246 genes \u2014
p224
aVbut we were able to completely synthesize that genome.
p225
aVNow, you have the genome and you say to yourself,
p226
aVSo, if I plug this synthetic genome \u2014 if I pull the old one out and plug it in \u2014
p227
aVdoes it just boot up and live?
p228
aVWell, guess what. It does.
p229
aa(lp230
VNot only does it do that; if you took the genome \u2014 that synthetic genome \u2014
p231
aVand you plugged it into a different critter, like yeast,
p232
aVyou now turn that yeast into Mycoplasma.
p233
aVIt's, sort of, like booting up a PC with a Mac O.S. software.
p234
aVWell, actually, you could do it the other way.
p235
aVSo, you know, by being able to write a genome
p236
aVand plug it into an organism,
p237
aVthe software, if you will, changes the hardware.
p238
aVAnd this is extremely profound.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo, last year the French and Italians announced
p241
aVthey got together and they went ahead and they sequenced Pinot Noir.
p242
aVThe genomic sequence now exists for the entire Pinot Noir organism,
p243
aVand they identified, once again, about 29,000 genes.
p244
aVThey have discovered pathways that create flavors,
p245
aValthough it's very important to understand
p246
aVthat those compounds that it's cranking out
p247
aVhave to match a receptor in our genome, in our tongue,
p248
aVfor us to understand and interpret those flavors.
p249
aa(lp250
VThey've also discovered that
p251
aVthere's a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well.
p252
aVThey've identified areas of vulnerability to disease.
p253
aVThey now are understanding, and the work is going on,
p254
aVexactly how this plant works, and we have the capability to know,
p255
aVto read that entire code and understand how it ticks.
p256
aVSo, then what do you do?
p257
aVKnowing that we can read it, knowing that we can write it, change it,
p258
aVmaybe write its genome from scratch. So, what do you do?
p259
aVWell, one thing you could do is what some people might call Franken-Noir.
p260
aV(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
VWe can build a better vine.
p263
aVBy the way, just so you know:
p264
aVyou get stressed out about genetically modified organisms;
p265
aVthere is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere
p266
aVthat is not genetically modified.
p267
aVThey're not grown from seeds; they're grafted into root stock;
p268
aVthey would not exist in nature on their own.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo, don't worry about, don't stress about that stuff. We've been doing this forever.
p271
aVSo, we could, you know, focus on disease resistance;
p272
aVwe can go for higher yields without necessarily having
p273
aVdramatic farming techniques to do it, or costs.
p274
aVWe could conceivably expand the climate window:
p275
aVwe could make Pinot Noir grow maybe in Long Island, God forbid.
p276
aV(Laughter)
p277
aa(lp278
VWe could produce better flavors and aromas.
p279
aVYou want a little more raspberry, a little more chocolate here or there?
p280
aVAll of these things could conceivably be done,
p281
aVand I will tell you I'd pretty much bet that it will be done.
p282
aVBut there's an ecosystem here.
p283
aVIn other words, we're not, sort of, unique little organisms running around;
p284
aVwe are part of a big ecosystem.
p285
aa(lp286
VIn fact \u2014 I'm sorry to inform you \u2014
p287
aVthat inside of your digestive tract is about 10 pounds of microbes
p288
aVwhich you're circulating through your body quite a bit.
p289
aVOur ocean's teaming with microbes;
p290
aVin fact, when Craig Venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean,
p291
aVin the first three months tripled the known species on the planet
p292
aVby discovering all-new microbes in the first 20 feet of water.
p293
aVWe now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate
p294
aVand regulating CO2 and oxygen than plants do,
p295
aVwhich we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere.
p296
aa(lp297
VWe find microbial life in every part of the planet:
p298
aVin ice, in coal, in rocks, in volcanic vents; it's an amazing thing.
p299
aVBut we've also discovered, when it comes to plants, in plants,
p300
aVas much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes,
p301
aVit is the ecosystem around them,
p302
aVit is the microbes that live in their root systems,
p303
aVthat have just as much impact on the character of those plants
p304
aVas the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves.
p305
aa(lp306
VIf you take a closer look at a root system,
p307
aVyou will find there are many, many, many diverse microbial colonies.
p308
aVThis is not big news to viticulturists;
p309
aVthey have been, you know, concerned with water and fertilization.
p310
aVAnd, again, this is, sort of, my notion of shit-against-the-wall pharmacology:
p311
aVyou know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in.
p312
aVYou don't necessarily know with granularity
p313
aVexactly what organisms are providing what flavors and what characteristics.
p314
aVWe can start to figure that out.
p315
aVWe all talk about terroir; we worship terroir;
p316
aVwe say, Wow, is my terroir great! It's so special.
p317
aVI've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn't believe.
p318
aa(lp319
VWell, you know, we really, we argue and debate about it \u2014
p320
aVwe say it's climate, it's soil, it's this. Well, guess what?
p321
aVWe can figure out what the heck terroir is.
p322
aVIt's in there, waiting to be sequenced.
p323
aVThere are thousands of microbes there.
p324
aVThey're easy to sequence: unlike a human,
p325
aVthey, you know, have a thousand, two thousand genes;
p326
aVwe can figure out what they are.
p327
aa(lp328
VAll we have to do is go around and sample, dig into the ground, find those bugs,
p329
aVsequence them, correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don't like \u2014
p330
aVthat's just a big database \u2014 and then fertilize.
p331
aVAnd then we understand what is terroir.
p332
aVSo, some people will say, Oh, my God, are we playing God?
p333
aVAre we now, if we engineer organisms, are we playing God?
p334
aVAnd, you know, people would always ask James Watson \u2014
p335
aVhe's not always the most politically correct guy ...
p336
aV(Laughter)
p337
aV... and they would say, "Are, you know, are you playing God?"
p338
aVAnd he had the best answer I ever heard to this question:
p339
aV"Well, somebody has to."
p340
aV(Laughter)
p341
aa(lp342
VI consider myself a very spiritual person,
p343
aVand without, you know, the organized religion part,
p344
aVand I will tell you: I don't believe there's anything unnatural.
p345
aVI don't believe that chemicals are unnatural.
p346
aVI told you I'm going to make some of you puke.
p347
aVIt's very simple: we don't invent molecules, compounds.
p348
aVThey're here. They're in the universe.
p349
aVWe reorganize things, we change them around,
p350
aVbut we don't make anything unnatural.
p351
aa(lp352
VNow, we can create bad impacts \u2014
p353
aVwe can poison ourselves; we can poison the Earth \u2014
p354
aVbut that's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made.
p355
aVSo, what's happening today is, Nature is presenting us with a toolbox,
p356
aVand we find that this toolbox is very extensive.
p357
aVThere are microbes out there that actually make gasoline, believe it or not.
p358
aVThere are microbes, you know \u2014 go back to yeast.
p359
aVThese are chemical factories;
p360
aVthe most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by Nature,
p361
aVand we now can use those.
p362
aVThere also is a set of rules.
p363
aa(lp364
VNature will not allow you to \u2014
p365
aVwe could engineer a grape plant, but guess what.
p366
aVWe can't make the grape plant produce babies.
p367
aVNature has put a set of rules out there.
p368
aVWe can work within the rules; we can't break the rules;
p369
aVwe're just learning what the rules are.
p370
aVI just ask the question, if you could cure all disease \u2014
p371
aVif you could make disease go away,
p372
aVbecause we understand how it actually works,
p373
aVif we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious, healthy plants
p374
aVthat grow in very hard-to-grow environments,
p375
aVif we could create clean and plentiful energy \u2014
p376
aVwe, right in the labs at Synthetic Genomics,
p377
aVhave single-celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide
p378
aVand producing a molecule very similar to gasoline.
p379
aVSo, carbon dioxide \u2014 the stuff we want to get rid of \u2014 not sugar, not anything.
p380
aVCarbon dioxide, a little bit of sunlight,
p381
aVyou end up with a lipid that is highly refined.
p382
aVWe could solve our energy problems; we can reduce CO2,;
p383
aVwe could clean up our oceans; we could make better wine.
p384
aVIf we could, would we?
p385
aVWell, you know, I think the answer is very simple:
p386
aVworking with Nature, working with this tool set that we now understand,
p387
aVis the next step in humankind's evolution.
p388
aa(lp389
VAnd all I can tell you is, stay healthy for 20 years.
p390
aVIf you can stay healthy for 20 years, you'll see 150, maybe 300.
p391
aa(lp392
