VGeorge and Charlotte Blonsky, who were
p4
aVa married couple living in the Bronx in New York City,
p5
aVinvented something.
p6
aVThey got a patent in 1965 for what they call,
p7
aV"a device to assist women in giving birth."
p8
aVThis device consists of a large, round table
p9
aVand some machinery.
p10
aVWhen the woman is ready to deliver her child,
p11
aVshe lies on her back,
p12
aVshe is strapped down to the table,
p13
aVand the table is rotated at high speed.
p14
aVThe child comes flying out
p15
aVthrough centrifugal force.
p16
aVIf you look at their patent carefully,
p17
aVespecially if you have any engineering background or talent,
p18
aVyou may decide that you see
p19
aVone or two points where the design is  not perfectly adequate. (Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VDoctor Ivan Schwab in California
p22
aVis one of the people,  one of the main people,
p23
aVwho helped answer the question,
p24
aV"Why don't woodpeckers get headaches?"
p25
aVAnd it turns out the answer to that
p26
aVis because their brains
p27
aVare packaged inside their skulls
p28
aVin a way different from the way
p29
aVour brains, we being human beings,
p30
aVtrue, have our brains packaged.
p31
aVThey, the woodpeckers, typically
p32
aVwill peck, they will bang their head
p33
aVon a piece of wood thousands  of times every day. Every day!
p34
aVAnd as far as anyone knows,
p35
aVthat doesn't bother them in the slightest.
p36
aa(lp37
VHow does this happen?
p38
aVTheir brain does not slosh around like ours does.
p39
aVTheir brain is packed in very tightly,
p40
aVat least for blows coming  right from the front.
p41
aVNot too many people paid attention
p42
aVto this research until the last few years
p43
aVwhen, in this country especially,
p44
aVpeople are becoming curious about
p45
aVwhat happens to the brains of football players
p46
aVwho bang their heads repeatedly.
p47
aVAnd the woodpecker maybe relates to that.
p48
aa(lp49
VThere was a paper published
p50
aVin the medical journal The Lancet
p51
aVin England a few years ago called
p52
aV" A man who pricked his finger and smelled putrid for 5 years."
p53
aVDr. Caroline Mills and her team
p54
aVreceived this patient and didn't  really know what to do about it.
p55
aVThe man had cut his finger,
p56
aVhe worked processing chickens,
p57
aVand then he started to smell really, really bad.
p58
aVSo bad that when  he got in a room
p59
aVwith the doctors and the nurses,
p60
aVthey couldn't stand being  in the room with him.
p61
aVIt was intolerable.
p62
aVThey tried every drug,
p63
aVevery other treatment they could think of.
p64
aVAfter a year, he still  smelled putrid.
p65
aVAfter two years, still smelled putrid.
p66
aVThree years, four years, still smelled putrid.
p67
aVAfter five years, it went away on its own.
p68
aVIt's a mystery.
p69
aa(lp70
VIn New Zealand, Dr. Lianne Parkin
p71
aVand her team tested an old  tradition in her city.
p72
aVThey live in a city that has huge hills,
p73
aVSan Francisco-grade hills.
p74
aVAnd in the winter there, it gets very cold
p75
aVand very icy.
p76
aVThere are lots of injuries.
p77
aVThe tradition that they tested,
p78
aVthey tested by asking people
p79
aVwho were on their way to  work in the morning,
p80
aVto stop and try something out.
p81
aVTry one of two conditions.
p82
aVThe tradition is that in the winter,
p83
aVin that city, you wear your socks on the outside of your boots.
p84
aVAnd what they discovered by experiment,
p85
aVand it was quite graphic when they saw it,
p86
aVwas that it's true.
p87
aVThat if you wear your socks on the  outside rather than the inside,
p88
aVyou're much more likely  to survive and not slip and fall.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow, I hope you will agree with me that these things
p91
aVI've just described to you,
p92
aVeach of them, deserves some kind of prize. (Laughter)
p93
aVAnd that's what they got,
p94
aVeach of them got an Ig Nobel prize.
p95
aVIn 1991, I, together with bunch of other people,
p96
aVstarted the Ig Nobel prize ceremony.
p97
aVEvery year we give out 10 prizes.
p98
aVThe prizes are based on just  one criteria. It's very simple.
p99
aVIt's that you've done something that  makes people laugh and then think.
p100
aVWhat you've done makes  people laugh and then think.
p101
aVWhatever it is, there's something about it
p102
aVthat when people encounter it at first,
p103
aVtheir only possible reaction is to laugh.
p104
aVAnd then a week later,
p105
aVit's still rattling around in their heads
p106
aVand all they want to do  is tell their friends about it.
p107
aVThat's the quality we look for.
p108
aa(lp109
VEvery year, we get in the neighborhood
p110
aVof 9,000 new nominations  for the Ig Nobel prize.
p111
aVOf those, consistently between 10 percent
p112
aVand 20 percent of those nominations
p113
aVare people who nominate themselves.
p114
aVThose self-nominees almost never win.
p115
aVIt's very difficult, numerically,  to win a prize if you want to.
p116
aVEven if you don't want to,
p117
aVit's very difficult numerically.
p118
aVYou should know that when  we choose somebody
p119
aVto win an Ig Nobel prize,
p120
aVWe get in touch with that person, very quietly.
p121
aVWe offer them the chance to decline
p122
aVthis great honor if they want to.
p123
aVHappily for us, almost everyone  who's offered a prize
p124
aVdecides to accept.
p125
aa(lp126
VWhat do you get if you win an Ig Nobel prize?
p127
aVWell, you get several things.
p128
aVYou get an Ig Nobel prize.
p129
aVThe design is different every year.
p130
aVThese are always handmade from extremely cheap materials.
p131
aVYou're looking at a picture
p132
aVof the prize we gave last year, 2013.
p133
aVMost prizes in the world also give
p134
aVtheir winners some cash, some money.
p135
aVWe don't have any money,
p136
aVso we can't give them.
p137
aVIn fact, the winners have to pay their own way
p138
aVto come to the Ig Nobel ceremony,
p139
aVwhich most of them do.
p140
aVLast year, though, we did manage to scrape up some money.
p141
aVLast year, each of the 10 Ig Nobel prize winners
p142
aVreceived from us 10 trillion dollars.
p143
aVA $10 trillion bill from Zimbabwe. (Laughter)
p144
aVYou may remember that  Zimbabwe had a little adventure
p145
aVfor a few years there of inflation.
p146
aVThey ended up printing bills
p147
aVthat were in denominations as large as 100 trillion dollars.
p148
aVThe man responsible, who runs the national bank there, by the way,
p149
aVwon an Ig Nobel prize in mathematics.
p150
aa(lp151
VThe other thing you win is an invitation
p152
aVto come to the ceremony,
p153
aVwhich happens at Harvard University.
p154
aVAnd when you get there,
p155
aVyou come to Harvard's biggest  meeting place and classroom.
p156
aVIt fits 1,100 people,
p157
aVit's jammed to the gills,
p158
aVand up on the stage,
p159
aVwaiting to shake your hand,
p160
aVwaiting to hand you your Ig Nobel prize,
p161
aVare a bunch of Nobel prize winners.
p162
aVThat's the heart of the ceremony.
p163
aVThe winners are kept secret until that moment,
p164
aVeven the Nobel laureates  who will shake their hand
p165
aVdon't know who they are until they're announced.
p166
aa(lp167
VI am going to tell you  about just a very few
p168
aVof the other medical-related prizes we've given.
p169
aVKeep in mind, we've given 230 prizes.
p170
aVThere are lots of these people who walk among you.
p171
aVMaybe you have one.
p172
aVA paper was published about 30 years ago
p173
aVcalled "Injuries due to Falling Coconuts."
p174
aVIt was written by Dr. Peter Barss,
p175
aVwho is Canadian.
p176
aVDr. Barss came to the ceremony
p177
aVand explained that as a young doctor,
p178
aVhe wanted to see the world.
p179
aVSo he went to Papua New Guinea.
p180
aVWhen he got there, he went to work in a hospital, and he was curious
p181
aVwhat kinds of things happen to people that bring them to the hospital.
p182
aVHe looked through the  records, and he discovered
p183
aVthat a surprisingly large number of people
p184
aVin that hospital were there
p185
aVbecause of injuries due to falling coconuts.
p186
aVOne typical thing that happens is
p187
aVpeople will come from the highlands, where there are not many coconut trees,
p188
aVdown to visit their relatives on the coast,
p189
aVwhere there are lots.
p190
aVAnd they'll think that a coconut tree
p191
aVis a fine place to stand and maybe lie down.
p192
aVA coconut tree that is 90 feet tall,
p193
aVand has coconuts that weigh two pounds
p194
aVthat can drop off at any time.
p195
aa(lp196
VA team of doctors in Europe
p197
aVpublished a series of papers about colonoscopies.
p198
aVYou're all familiar with colonoscopies,
p199
aVone way or another.
p200
aVOr in some cases,
p201
aVone way and another.
p202
aVThey, in these papers,
p203
aVexplained to their fellow doctors who perform colonoscopies,
p204
aVhow to minimize the chance
p205
aVthat when you perform a colonoscopy,
p206
aVyour patient will explode. (Laughter)
p207
aVDr. Emmanuel Ben-Soussan
p208
aVone of the authors,
p209
aVflew in from Paris to the ceremony,
p210
aVwhere he explained the history of this,
p211
aVthat in the 1950s,
p212
aVwhen colonoscopies were becoming a common technique for the first time,
p213
aVpeople were figuring out how to do it well.
p214
aVAnd there were some difficulties at first.
p215
aVThe basic problem, I'm sure you're familiar with,
p216
aVthat you're looking inside a  long, narrow, dark place.
p217
aVAnd so, you want to have a larger space.
p218
aVYou add some gas to inflate it
p219
aVso you have room to look around.
p220
aVNow, that's added to the  gas, the methane gas,
p221
aVthat's already inside.
p222
aVThe gas that they used at first, in many cases, was oxygen.
p223
aVSo they added oxygen to methane gas.
p224
aVAnd then they wanted to be able to see,
p225
aVthey needed light,
p226
aVso they'd put in a light source,
p227
aVwhich in the 1950s was very hot.
p228
aVSo you had methane gas, which is flammable,
p229
aVoxygen and heat.
p230
aVThey stopped using oxygen pretty quickly. (Laughter)
p231
aVNow it's rare that patients will explode,
p232
aVbut it does still happen.
p233
aa(lp234
VThe final thing that I want  to tell you about is a prize
p235
aVwe gave to Dr. Elena Bodnar.
p236
aVDr. Elena Bodnar invented a brassiere
p237
aVthat in an emergency
p238
aVcan be quickly separated
p239
aVinto a pair of protective face masks.
p240
aVOne to save your life,
p241
aVone to save the life of some  lucky bystander. (Laughter)
p242
aVWhy would someone do this, you might wonder.
p243
aVDr. Bodnar came to the ceremony
p244
aVand she explained that  she grew up in Ukraine.
p245
aVShe was one of the doctors who treated victims
p246
aVof the Chernobyl power plant meltdown.
p247
aVAnd they later discovered that
p248
aVa lot of the worst medical problems
p249
aVcame from the particles people breathed in.
p250
aVSo she was always thinking after that
p251
aVabout could there be some simple mask
p252
aVthat was available everywhere when the unexpected happens.
p253
aVYears later, she moved to America.
p254
aVShe had a baby,
p255
aVOne day she looked, and on the floor,
p256
aVher infant son had picked up her bra,
p257
aVand had her bra on his face.
p258
aVAnd that's where the idea came from.
p259
aVShe came to the Ig Nobel ceremony
p260
aVwith the first prototype of the bra
p261
aVand she demonstrated:
p262
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p263
aV["Paul Krugman, Nobel laureate  (2008) in economics"]
p264
aV["Wolfgang Ketterle, Nobel  laureate (2001) in physics"]
p265
aa(lp266
VI myself own an emergency bra. (Laughter)
p267
aVIt's my favorite bra,
p268
aVbut I would be happy to  share it with any of you,
p269
aVshould the need arise.
p270
aVThank you.
