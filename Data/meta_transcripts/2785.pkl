VI'd like to start with a simple question:
p4
aVWhy do the poor make so many poor decisions?
p5
aVI know it's a harsh question,
p6
aVbut take a look at the data.
p7
aVThe poor borrow more, save less,
p8
aVsmoke more, exercise less, drink more
p9
aVand eat less healthfully.
p10
aVWhy?
p11
aa(lp12
VWell, the standard explanation
p13
aVwas once summed up by the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.
p14
aVAnd she called poverty "a personality defect."
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VA lack of character, basically.
p19
aa(lp20
VNow, I'm sure not many of you would be so blunt.
p21
aVBut the idea that there's something wrong with the poor themselves
p22
aVis not restricted to Mrs. Thatcher.
p23
aVSome of you may believe that the poor should be held responsible
p24
aVfor their own mistakes.
p25
aVAnd others may argue that we should help them to make better decisions.
p26
aVBut the underlying assumption is the same:
p27
aVthere's something wrong with them.
p28
aVIf we could just change them,
p29
aVif we could just teach them how to live their lives,
p30
aVif they would only listen.
p31
aVAnd to be honest,
p32
aVthis was what I thought for a long time.
p33
aVIt was only a few years ago that I discovered
p34
aVthat everything I thought I knew about poverty was wrong.
p35
aa(lp36
VIt all started when I accidentally stumbled upon a paper
p37
aVby a few American psychologists.
p38
aVThey had traveled 8,000 miles, all the way to India,
p39
aVfor a fascinating study.
p40
aVAnd it was an experiment with sugarcane farmers.
p41
aVYou should know that these farmers collect about 60 percent
p42
aVof their annual income all at once,
p43
aVright after the harvest.
p44
aVThis means that they're relatively poor one part of the year
p45
aVand rich the other.
p46
aVThe researchers asked them to do an IQ test before and after the harvest.
p47
aVWhat they subsequently discovered completely blew my mind.
p48
aVThe farmers scored much worse on the test before the harvest.
p49
aVThe effects of living in poverty, it turns out,
p50
aVcorrespond to losing 14 points of IQ.
p51
aVNow, to give you an idea,
p52
aVthat's comparable to losing a night's sleep
p53
aVor the effects of alcoholism.
p54
aa(lp55
VA few months later, I heard that Eldar Shafir,
p56
aVa professor at Princeton University and one of the authors of this study,
p57
aVwas coming over to Holland, where I live.
p58
aVSo we met up in Amsterdam
p59
aVto talk about his revolutionary new theory of poverty.
p60
aVAnd I can sum it up in just two words:
p61
aVscarcity mentality.
p62
aVIt turns out that people behave differently
p63
aVwhen they perceive a thing to be scarce.
p64
aVAnd what that thing is doesn't much matter \u2014
p65
aVwhether it's not enough time, money or food.
p66
aa(lp67
VYou all know this feeling,
p68
aVwhen you've got too much to do,
p69
aVor when you've put off breaking for lunch
p70
aVand your blood sugar takes a dive.
p71
aVThis narrows your focus to your immediate lack \u2014
p72
aVto the sandwich you've got to have now,
p73
aVthe meeting that's starting in five minutes
p74
aVor the bills that have to be paid tomorrow.
p75
aVSo the long-term perspective goes out the window.
p76
aVYou could compare it to a new computer
p77
aVthat's running 10 heavy programs at once.
p78
aVIt gets slower and slower, making errors.
p79
aVEventually, it freezes \u2014
p80
aVnot because it's a bad computer,
p81
aVbut because it has too much to do at once.
p82
aVThe poor have the same problem.
p83
aVThey're not making dumb decisions because they are dumb,
p84
aVbut because they're living in a context
p85
aVin which anyone would make dumb decisions.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo suddenly I understood
p88
aVwhy so many of our anti-poverty programs don't work.
p89
aVInvestments in education, for example, are often completely ineffective.
p90
aVPoverty is not a lack of knowledge.
p91
aVA recent analysis of 201 studies
p92
aVon the effectiveness of money-management training
p93
aVcame to the conclusion that it has almost no effect at all.
p94
aVNow, don't get me wrong \u2014
p95
aVthis is not to say the poor don't learn anything \u2014
p96
aVthey can come out wiser for sure.
p97
aVBut it's not enough.
p98
aVOr as Professor Shafir told me,
p99
aV"It's like teaching someone to swim
p100
aVand then throwing them in a stormy sea."
p101
aa(lp102
VI still remember sitting there,
p103
aVperplexed.
p104
aVAnd it struck me
p105
aVthat we could have figured this all out decades ago.
p106
aVI mean, these psychologists didn't need any complicated brain scans;
p107
aVthey only had to measure the farmer's IQ,
p108
aVand IQ tests were invented more than 100 years ago.
p109
aVActually, I realized I had read about the psychology of poverty before.
p110
aVGeorge Orwell, one of the greatest writers who ever lived,
p111
aVexperienced poverty firsthand in the 1920s.
p112
aV"The essence of poverty," he wrote back then,
p113
aVis that it "annihilates the future."
p114
aVAnd he marveled at, quote,
p115
aV"How people take it for granted they have the right to preach at you
p116
aVand pray over you
p117
aVas soon as your income falls below a certain level."
p118
aa(lp119
VNow, those words are every bit as resonant today.
p120
aVThe big question is, of course:
p121
aVWhat can be done?
p122
aVModern economists have a few solutions up their sleeves.
p123
aVWe could help the poor with their paperwork
p124
aVor send them a text message to remind them to pay their bills.
p125
aVThis type of solution is hugely popular with modern politicians,
p126
aVmostly because,
p127
aVwell, they cost next to nothing.
p128
aVThese solutions are, I think, a symbol of this era
p129
aVin which we so often treat the symptoms,
p130
aVbut ignore the underlying cause.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo I wonder:
p133
aVWhy don't we just change the context in which the poor live?
p134
aVOr, going back to our computer analogy:
p135
aVWhy keep tinkering around with the software
p136
aVwhen we can easily solve the problem by installing some extra memory instead?
p137
aVAt that point, Professor Shafir responded with a blank look.
p138
aVAnd after a few seconds, he said,
p139
aV"Oh, I get it.
p140
aVYou mean you want to just hand out more money to the poor
p141
aVto eradicate poverty.
p142
aVUh, sure, that'd be great.
p143
aVBut I'm afraid that brand of left-wing politics
p144
aVyou've got in Amsterdam \u2014
p145
aVit doesn't exist in the States."
p146
aa(lp147
VBut is this really an old-fashioned, leftist idea?
p148
aVI remembered reading about an old plan \u2014
p149
aVsomething that has been proposed by some of history's leading thinkers.
p150
aVThe philosopher Thomas More first hinted at it in his book, "Utopia,"
p151
aVmore than 500 years ago.
p152
aVAnd its proponents have spanned the spectrum from the left to the right,
p153
aVfrom the civil rights campaigner, Martin Luther King,
p154
aVto the economist Milton Friedman.
p155
aVAnd it's an incredibly simple idea:
p156
aVbasic income guarantee.
p157
aa(lp158
VWhat it is?
p159
aVWell, that's easy.
p160
aVIt's a monthly grant, enough to pay for your basic needs:
p161
aVfood, shelter, education.
p162
aVIt's completely unconditional,
p163
aVso no one's going to tell you what you have to do for it,
p164
aVand no one's going to tell you what you have to do with it.
p165
aVThe basic income is not a favor, but a right.
p166
aVThere's absolutely no stigma attached.
p167
aVSo as I learned about the true nature of poverty,
p168
aVI couldn't stop wondering:
p169
aVIs this the idea we've all been waiting for?
p170
aVCould it really be that simple?
p171
aVAnd in the three years that followed,
p172
aVI read everything I could find about basic income.
p173
aVI researched the dozens of experiments
p174
aVthat have been conducted all over the globe,
p175
aVand it didn't take long before I stumbled upon a story of a town
p176
aVthat had done it \u2014 had actually eradicated poverty.
p177
aVBut then ...
p178
aVnearly everyone forgot about it.
p179
aa(lp180
VThis story starts in Dauphin, Canada.
p181
aVIn 1974, everybody in this small town was guaranteed a basic income,
p182
aVensuring that no one fell below the poverty line.
p183
aVAt the start of the experiment,
p184
aVan army of researchers descended on the town.
p185
aVFor four years, all went well.
p186
aVBut then a new government was voted into power,
p187
aVand the new Canadian cabinet saw little point to the expensive experiment.
p188
aVSo when it became clear there was no money left to analyze the results,
p189
aVthe researchers decided to pack their files away in some 2,000 boxes.
p190
aVTwenty-five years went by,
p191
aVand then Evelyn Forget, a Canadian professor,
p192
aVfound the records.
p193
aVFor three years, she subjected the data to all manner of statistical analysis,
p194
aVand no matter what she tried,
p195
aVthe results were the same every time:
p196
aVthe experiment had been a resounding success.
p197
aa(lp198
VEvelyn Forget discovered
p199
aVthat the people in Dauphin had not only become richer
p200
aVbut also smarter and healthier.
p201
aVThe school performance of kids improved substantially.
p202
aVThe hospitalization rate decreased by as much as 8.5 percent.
p203
aVDomestic violence incidents were down,
p204
aVas were mental health complaints.
p205
aVAnd people didn't quit their jobs.
p206
aVThe only ones who worked a little less were new mothers and students \u2014
p207
aVwho stayed in school longer.
p208
aVSimilar results have since been found
p209
aVin countless other experiments around the globe,
p210
aVfrom the US to India.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo ...
p213
aVhere's what I've learned.
p214
aVWhen it comes to poverty,
p215
aVwe, the rich, should stop pretending we know best.
p216
aVWe should stop sending shoes and teddy bears to the poor,
p217
aVto people we have never met.
p218
aVAnd we should get rid of the vast industry of paternalistic bureaucrats
p219
aVwhen we could simply hand over their salaries
p220
aVto the poor they're supposed to help.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Applause)
p223
aa(lp224
VBecause, I mean, the great thing about money
p225
aVis that people can use it to buy things they need
p226
aVinstead of things that self-appointed experts think they need.
p227
aVJust imagine how many brilliant scientists and entrepreneurs and writers,
p228
aVlike George Orwell,
p229
aVare now withering away in scarcity.
p230
aVImagine how much energy and talent we would unleash
p231
aVif we got rid of poverty once and for all.
p232
aVI believe that a basic income would work like venture capital for the people.
p233
aVAnd we can't afford not to do it,
p234
aVbecause poverty is hugely expensive.
p235
aVJust look at the cost of child poverty in the US, for example.
p236
aVIt's estimated at 500 billion dollars each year,
p237
aVin terms of higher health care spending, higher dropout rates,
p238
aVand more crime.
p239
aVNow, this is an incredible waste of human potential.
p240
aa(lp241
VBut let's talk about the elephant in the room.
p242
aVHow could we ever afford a basic income guarantee?
p243
aVWell, it's actually a lot cheaper than you may think.
p244
aVWhat they did in Dauphin is finance it with a negative income tax.
p245
aVThis means that your income is topped up
p246
aVas soon as you fall below the poverty line.
p247
aVAnd in that scenario,
p248
aVaccording to our economists' best estimates,
p249
aVfor a net cost of 175 billion \u2014
p250
aVa quarter of US military spending, one percent of GDP \u2014
p251
aVyou could lift all impoverished Americans above the poverty line.
p252
aVYou could actually eradicate poverty.
p253
aVNow, that should be our goal.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Applause)
p256
aa(lp257
VThe time for small thoughts and little nudges is past.
p258
aVI really believe that the time has come for radical new ideas,
p259
aVand basic income is so much more than just another policy.
p260
aVIt is also a complete rethink of what work actually is.
p261
aVAnd in that sense,
p262
aVit will not only free the poor,
p263
aVbut also the rest of us.
p264
aa(lp265
VNowadays, millions of people feel
p266
aVthat their jobs have little meaning or significance.
p267
aVA recent poll among 230,000 employees
p268
aVin 142 countries
p269
aVfound that only 13 percent of workers actually like their job.
p270
aVAnd another poll found that as much as 37 percent of British workers
p271
aVhave a job that they think doesn't even need to exist.
p272
aVIt's like Brad Pitt says in "Fight Club,"
p273
aV"Too often we're working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need."
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VNow, don't get me wrong \u2014
p278
aVI'm not talking about the teachers and the garbagemen
p279
aVand the care workers here.
p280
aVIf they stopped working,
p281
aVwe'd be in trouble.
p282
aVI'm talking about all those well-paid professionals with excellent résumés
p283
aVwho earn their money doing ...
p284
aVstrategic transactor peer-to-peer meetings
p285
aVwhile brainstorming the value add-on of disruptive co-creation
p286
aVin the network society.
p287
aa(lp288
V(Laughter)
p289
aa(lp290
V(Applause)
p291
aa(lp292
VOr something like that.
p293
aVJust imagine again how much talent we're wasting,
p294
aVsimply because we tell our kids they'll have to "earn a living."
p295
aVOr think of what a math whiz working at Facebook lamented a few years ago:
p296
aV"The best minds of my generation
p297
aVare thinking about how to make people click ads."
p298
aa(lp299
VI'm a historian.
p300
aVAnd if history teaches us anything,
p301
aVit is that things could be different.
p302
aVThere is nothing inevitable
p303
aVabout the way we structured our society and economy right now.
p304
aVIdeas can and do change the world.
p305
aVAnd I think that especially in the past few years,
p306
aVit has become abundantly clear
p307
aVthat we cannot stick to the status quo \u2014
p308
aVthat we need new ideas.
p309
aa(lp310
VI know that many of you may feel pessimistic
p311
aVabout a future of rising inequality,
p312
aVxenophobia
p313
aVand climate change.
p314
aVBut it's not enough to know what we're against.
p315
aVWe also need to be for something.
p316
aVMartin Luther King didn't say, "I have a nightmare."
p317
aa(lp318
V(Laughter)
p319
aa(lp320
VHe had a dream.
p321
aa(lp322
V(Applause)
p323
aa(lp324
VSo ...
p325
aVhere's my dream:
p326
aVI believe in a future
p327
aVwhere the value of your work is not determined
p328
aVby the size of your paycheck,
p329
aVbut by the amount of happiness you spread
p330
aVand the amount of meaning you give.
p331
aVI believe in a future
p332
aVwhere the point of education is not to prepare you for another useless job
p333
aVbut for a life well-lived.
p334
aVI believe in a future
p335
aVwhere an existence without poverty is not a privilege
p336
aVbut a right we all deserve.
p337
aVSo here we are.
p338
aVHere we are.
p339
aVWe've got the research, we've got the evidence
p340
aVand we've got the means.
p341
aa(lp342
VNow, more than 500 years after Thomas More first wrote about a basic income,
p343
aVand 100 years after George Orwell discovered the true nature of poverty,
p344
aVwe all need to change our worldview,
p345
aVbecause poverty is not a lack of character.
p346
aVPoverty is a lack of cash.
p347
aa(lp348
VThank you.
