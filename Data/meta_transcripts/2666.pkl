aa(lp6
V"Ashley Judd, stupid fucking slut.
p7
aa(lp8
V"You can't sue someone for calling them a cunt."
p9
aa(lp10
V"If you can't handle the Internet, fuck off, whore."
p11
aa(lp12
V"I wish Ashley Judd would die a horrible death.
p13
aVShe is the absolute worst."
p14
aa(lp15
V"Ashley Judd, you're the reason women shouldn't vote."
p16
aa(lp17
V"'Twisted' is such a bad movie,
p18
aVI don't even want to rape it."
p19
aa(lp20
V"Whatever you do,
p21
aVdon't tell Ashley Judd. She'll die alone with a dried out vagina."
p22
aa(lp23
V"If I had to fuck an older woman,
p24
aVoh my God,
p25
aVI would fuck the shit out of Ashley Judd,
p26
aVthat bitch is hot af.
p27
aVThe unforgivable shit I would do to her."
p28
aa(lp29
VOnline misogyny is a global gender rights tragedy,
p30
aVand it is imperative that it ends.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Applause)
p33
aa(lp34
VGirls' and women's voices,
p35
aVand our allies' voices are constrained in ways
p36
aVthat are personally, economically,
p37
aVprofessionally and politically damaging.
p38
aVAnd when we curb abuse,
p39
aVwe will expand freedom.
p40
aa(lp41
VI am a Kentucky basketball fan,
p42
aVso on a fine March day last year,
p43
aVI was doing one of the things I do best:
p44
aVI was cheering for my Wildcats.
p45
aVThe daffodils were blooming,
p46
aVbut the referees were not blowing the whistle when I was telling them to.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VFunny, they're very friendly to me before the opening tip,
p51
aVbut they really ignore me during the game.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VThree of my players were bleeding, so I did the next best thing ...
p56
aVI tweeted.
p57
aa(lp58
V[@ArkRazorback dirty play can kiss my team's free throw making a \u2014
p59
aV@KySportsRadio @marchmadness @espn Bloodied 3 players so far.]
p60
aa(lp61
VIt is routine for me to be treated in the ways I've already described to you.
p62
aVIt happens to me every single day
p63
aVon social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.
p64
aVSince I joined Twitter in 2011,
p65
aVmisogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated
p66
aVthey will dog my every step.
p67
aVMy spirituality, my faith,
p68
aVbeing a hillbilly \u2014 I can say that, you can't \u2014
p69
aVall of it is fair game.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd I have responded to this with various strategies.
p72
aVI've tried engaging people.
p73
aVThis one guy was sending me hypersexual, nasty stuff,
p74
aVand there was a girl in his avatar.
p75
aVI wrote him back and said ...
p76
aV"Is that your daughter?
p77
aVI feel a lot of fear that you may think about
p78
aVand talk to women this way."
p79
aVAnd he surprised me by saying,
p80
aV"You know what? You're right. I apologize."
p81
aVSometimes people want to be held accountable.
p82
aVThis one guy was musing to I don't know who
p83
aVthat maybe I was the definition of a cunt.
p84
aVI was married to a Scot for 14 years,
p85
aVso I said, "Cunt means many different things in different countries \u2014
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
Vbut I'm pretty sure you epitomize the global standard of a dick."
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
V(Applause)
p94
aa(lp95
VI've tried to rise above it, I've tried to get in the trenches,
p96
aVbut mostly I would scroll through these social media platforms
p97
aVwith one eye partially closed, trying not to see it,
p98
aVbut you can't make a cucumber out of a pickle.
p99
aVWhat is seen goes in.
p100
aVIt's traumatic.
p101
aVAnd I was always secretly hoping in some part of me
p102
aVthat what was being said to me and about me wasn't ...
p103
aVtrue.
p104
aVBecause even I,
p105
aVan avowed, self-declared feminist,
p106
aVwho worships at the altar of Gloria \u2014
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
Vinternalize the patriarchy.
p111
aVThis is really critical.
p112
aVPatriarchy is not boys and men.
p113
aVIt is a system in which we all participate,
p114
aVincluding me.
p115
aa(lp116
VOn that particular day, for some reason,
p117
aVthat particular tweet after the basketball game
p118
aVtriggered something called a "cyber mob."
p119
aVThis vitriolic, global outpouring of the most heinous hate speech:
p120
aVdeath threats, rape threats.
p121
aVAnd don't you know,
p122
aVwhen I was sitting at home alone in my nightgown,
p123
aVI got a phone call, and it was my beloved former husband,
p124
aVand he said on a voice mail,
p125
aV"Loved one ...
p126
aVwhat is happening to you is not OK."
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd there was something about him taking a stand for me that night ...
p129
aVthat allowed me to take a stand for myself.
p130
aVAnd I started to write.
p131
aVI started to write about sharing the fact
p132
aVthat I'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse,
p133
aVincluding three rapes.
p134
aVAnd the hate speech I get in response to that \u2014
p135
aVthese are just some of the comments posted to news outlets.
p136
aVBeing told I'm a "snitch" is really fun.
p137
aa(lp138
V[Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!]
p139
aa(lp140
VAudience: Oh, Lord Jesus.
p141
aa(lp142
VAshley Judd: Thank you, Jesus. May your grace and mercy shine.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo, I wrote this feminist op-ed, it is entitled,
p145
aV"Forget Your Team:
p146
aVIt Is Your Online Gender Violence Toward Girls And Women
p147
aVThat Can Kiss My Righteous Ass."
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
V(Applause)
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd I did that alone, and I published it alone,
p154
aVbecause my chief advisor said,
p155
aV"Please don't,
p156
aVthe rain of retaliatory garbage that is inevitable \u2014
p157
aVI fear for you."
p158
aVBut I trust girls and I trust women,
p159
aVand I trust our allies.
p160
aVIt was published, it went viral,
p161
aVit proves that every single day
p162
aVonline misogyny is a phenomenon endured by us all,
p163
aVall over the world,
p164
aVand when it is intersectional,
p165
aVit is worse.
p166
aVSexual orientation, gender identity,
p167
aVrace, ethnicity, religion \u2014
p168
aVyou name it,
p169
aVit amplifies the violence endured by girls and women,
p170
aVand for our younger girls, it is worse.
p171
aa(lp172
VIt's clearly traumatizing.
p173
aVOur mental health, our emotional well-being
p174
aVare so gravely affected
p175
aVbecause the threat of violence
p176
aVis experienced neurobiologically as violence.
p177
aVThe cortisol shoots up, the limbic system gets fired,
p178
aVwe lose productivity at work.
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd let's talk about work.
p181
aVOur ability to work is constrained.
p182
aVOnline searches of women applying for jobs reveal nude pictures of them,
p183
aVfalse allegations they have STDs,
p184
aVtheir addresses indicating that they are available for sex
p185
aVwith real examples
p186
aVof people showing up at this house for said sex.
p187
aa(lp188
VOur ability to go to school is impaired.
p189
aV96 percent of all postings
p190
aVof sexual images of our young people ...
p191
aVgirls.
p192
aVOur girls.
p193
aVOur boys are two to three times more likely \u2014
p194
aVnonconsensually \u2014
p195
aVto share images.
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd I want to say a word about revenge porn.
p198
aVPart of what came out of this tweet
p199
aVwas my getting connected with allies and other activists
p200
aVwho are fighting for a safe and free internet.
p201
aVWe started something called the Speech Project;
p202
aVcurbing abuse, expanding freedom.
p203
aVAnd that website provides a critical forum,
p204
aVbecause there is no global, legal thing
p205
aVto help us figure this out.
p206
aVBut we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions,
p207
aVbecause it's hard to attack a behavior in the right way
p208
aVif we're not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is.
p209
aVAnd I learned that revenge porn is often dangerously misapplied.
p210
aVIt is the nonconsensual sharing of an image
p211
aVused tactically to shame and humiliate a girl or woman
p212
aVthat attempts to pornography us.
p213
aVOur natural sexuality is \u2014
p214
aVI don't know about yours \u2014 pretty gorgeous and wonderful.
p215
aVAnd my expressing it does not pornography make.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Applause)
p218
aa(lp219
VSo, I have all these resources
p220
aVthat I'm keenly aware so many people in the world do not.
p221
aVI was able to start the Speech Project with colleagues.
p222
aVI can often get a social media company's attention.
p223
aVI have a wonderful visit to Facebook HQ coming up.
p224
aVHasn't helped the idiotic reporting standards yet ...
p225
aVI actually pay someone to scrub my social media feeds,
p226
aVattempting to spare my brain
p227
aVthe daily iterations of the trauma of hate speech.
p228
aVAnd guess what?
p229
aVI get hate speech for that.
p230
aV"Oh, you live in an echo chamber."
p231
aVWell, guess what?
p232
aVHaving someone post a photograph of me with my mouth open
p233
aVsaying they "can't wait to cum on my face,"
p234
aVI have a right to set that boundary.
p235
aa(lp236
V(Applause)
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd this distinction between virtual and real is specious
p239
aVbecause guess what \u2014
p240
aVthat actually happened to me once when I was a child,
p241
aVand so that tweet brought up that trauma,
p242
aVand I had to do work on that.
p243
aa(lp244
VBut you know what we do? We take all of this hate speech,
p245
aVand we disaggregate it,
p246
aVand we code it,
p247
aVand we give that data
p248
aVso that we understand the intersectionality of it:
p249
aVwhen I get porn,
p250
aVwhen it's about political affiliation,
p251
aVwhen it's about age, when it's about all of it.
p252
aVWe're going to win this fight.
p253
aa(lp254
VThere are a lot of solutions \u2014
p255
aVthank goodness.
p256
aVI'm going to offer just a few,
p257
aVand of course I challenge you to create and contribute your own.
p258
aVNumber one: we have to start with digital media literacy,
p259
aVand clearly it must have a gendered lens.
p260
aVKids, schools, caregivers, parents:
p261
aVit's essential.
p262
aVTwo ...
p263
aVshall we talk about our friends in tech?
p264
aVSaid with dignity and respect,
p265
aVthe sexism in your workplaces must end.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Applause)
p268
aa(lp269
V(Cheers)
p270
aa(lp271
VEDGE,
p272
aVthe global standard for gender equality,
p273
aVis the minimum standard.
p274
aVAnd guess what, Silicon Valley?
p275
aVIf L'Oréal in India,
p276
aVin the Philippines, in Brazil
p277
aVand in Russia can do it,
p278
aVyou can, too.
p279
aVEnough excuses.
p280
aVOnly when women have critical mass in every department at your companies,
p281
aVincluding building platforms from the ground up,
p282
aVwill the conversations about priorities and solutions change.
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd more love for my friends in tech:
p285
aVprofiteering off misogyny in video games must end.
p286
aVI'm so tired of hearing you talk to me at cocktail parties \u2014
p287
aVlike you did a couple weeks ago in Aspen \u2014
p288
aVabout how deplorable #Gamergate was,
p289
aVwhen you're still making billions of dollars off games
p290
aVthat maim and dump women for sport.
p291
aVBasta! \u2014 as the Italians would say.
p292
aVEnough.
p293
aa(lp294
V(Applause)
p295
aa(lp296
VOur friends in law enforcement have much to do,
p297
aVbecause we've seen
p298
aVthat online violence is an extension of in-person violence.
p299
aVIn our country,
p300
aVmore girls and women have been murdered by their intimate partners
p301
aVthan died on 9/11
p302
aVand have died since in Afghanistan and Iraq combined.
p303
aVAnd it's not cool to say that,
p304
aVbut it is true.
p305
aVWe care so much geopolitically about what men are doing over there
p306
aVto women over there ...
p307
aVIn 2015,
p308
aV72,828 women used intimate partner violence services in this country.
p309
aVThat is not counting the girls and women and boys who needed them.
p310
aVLaw enforcement must be empowered
p311
aVwith up-to-date internet technology,
p312
aVthe devices and an understanding of these platforms \u2014
p313
aVhow they work.
p314
aVThe police wanted to be helpful when Amanda Hess called
p315
aVabout the death threat she was getting on Twitter,
p316
aVbut they couldn't really when they said,
p317
aV"What's Twitter?"
p318
aa(lp319
VOur legislators must write and pass astute legislation
p320
aVthat reflects today's technology
p321
aVand our notions of free and hate speech.
p322
aVIn New York recently, the law could not be applied to a perpetrator
p323
aVbecause the crimes must have been committed \u2014
p324
aVeven if it was anonymous \u2014
p325
aVthey must have been committed by telephone, in mail,
p326
aVby telegraph \u2014
p327
aa(lp328
V(Laughter)
p329
aa(lp330
VThe language must be technologically neutral.
p331
aa(lp332
VSo apparently,
p333
aVI've got a pretty bold voice.
p334
aVSo, let's talk about our friends ...
p335
aVwhite men.
p336
aVYou have a role to play and a choice to make.
p337
aVYou can do something,
p338
aVor you can do nothing.
p339
aVWe're cool in this room,
p340
aVbut when this goes out, everyone will say,
p341
aV"Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."
p342
aVThat quote was said by a white man, Robert Moritz,
p343
aVchairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers,
p344
aVhe asked me to include it in my talk.
p345
aa(lp346
VWe need to grow support lines and help groups,
p347
aVso victims can help each other
p348
aVwhen their lives and finances have been derailed.
p349
aVWe must as individuals disrupt gender violence as it is happening.
p350
aV92 percent of young people
p351
aV29 and under witness it.
p352
aV72 percent of us have witnessed it.
p353
aVWe must have the courage and urgency
p354
aVto practice stopping it as it is unfolding.
p355
aa(lp356
VAnd lastly,
p357
aVbelieve her.
p358
aVBelieve her.
p359
aa(lp360
V(Applause)
p361
aa(lp362
VThis is fundamentally a problem of human interaction.
p363
aVAnd as I believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing,
p364
aVtrauma not transformed will be trauma transferred.
p365
aa(lp366
VEdith Wharton said, "The end is latent in the beginning,"
p367
aVso we are going to end this talk replacing hate speech with love speech.
p368
aVBecause I get lonely in this,
p369
aVbut I know that we are allies.
p370
aVI recently learned
p371
aVabout how gratitude and affirmations offset negative interactions.
p372
aVIt takes five of those to offset one negative interaction,
p373
aVand gratitude in particular \u2014
p374
aVfree, available globally any time, anywhere,
p375
aVto anyone in any dialect \u2014
p376
aVit fires the pregenual anterior cingulate,
p377
aVa watershed part of the brain
p378
aVthat floods it with great, good stuff.
p379
aVSo I'm going to say awesome stuff about myself.
p380
aVI would like for you to reflect it back to me.
p381
aVIt might sound something like this \u2014
p382
aa(lp383
V(Laughter)
p384
aa(lp385
VI am a powerful and strong woman, and you would say, "Yes, you are."
p386
aa(lp387
VAudience: Yes, you are.
p388
aa(lp389
VAshley Judd: My mama loves me.
p390
aa(lp391
VA: Yes, she does.
p392
aa(lp393
VAJ: I did a great job with my talk.
p394
aa(lp395
VA: Yes, you did.
p396
aa(lp397
VAJ: I have a right to be here.
p398
aa(lp399
VA: Yes, you do.
p400
aa(lp401
VAJ: I'm really cute.
p402
aa(lp403
V(Laughter)
p404
aa(lp405
VA: Yes, you are.
p406
aa(lp407
VAJ: God does good work.
p408
aa(lp409
VA: Yes, He does.
p410
aa(lp411
VAJ: And I love you.
p412
aVThank you so much for letting me be of service.
p413
