(lp3
VIt's the fifth time I stand on this shore,
p4
aVthe Cuban shore,
p5
aVlooking out at that distant horizon,
p6
aVbelieving, again,
p7
aVthat I'm going to make it all the way
p8
aVacross that vast, dangerous wilderness of an ocean.
p9
aVNot only have I tried four times,
p10
aVbut the greatest swimmers in the world have been trying since 1950,
p11
aVand it's still never been done.
p12
aa(lp13
VThe team is proud of our four attempts.
p14
aVIt's an expedition of some 30 people.
p15
aVBonnie is my best friend and head handler,
p16
aVwho somehow summons will,
p17
aVthat last drop of will within me, when I think it's gone,
p18
aVafter many, many hours and days out there.
p19
aVThe shark experts are the best in the world \u2014
p20
aVlarge predators below.
p21
aVThe box jellyfish, the deadliest venom in all of the ocean,
p22
aVis in these waters,
p23
aVand I have come close to dying from them on a previous attempt.
p24
aVThe conditions themselves,
p25
aVbesides the sheer distance of over 100 miles in the open ocean \u2014
p26
aVthe currents and whirling eddies and the Gulf Stream itself,
p27
aVthe most unpredictable of all of the planet Earth.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd by the way \u2014 it's amusing to me
p30
aVthat journalists and people, before these attempts, often ask me,
p31
aV"Well, are you going to go with any boats or any people or anything?"
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd I'm thinking, what are they imagining?
p36
aVThat I'll just sort of do some celestial navigation \u2014
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd carry a bowie knife in my mouth,
p41
aVand I'll hunt fish and skin them alive and eat them,
p42
aVand maybe drag a desalinization plant behind me for fresh water.
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VYes, I have a team.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd the team is expert,
p51
aVand the team is courageous,
p52
aVand brimming with innovation and scientific discovery,
p53
aVas is true of any major expedition on the planet.
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd we've been on a journey.
p56
aVAnd the debate has raged, hasn't it,
p57
aVsince the Greeks,
p58
aVof isn't it what it's all about?
p59
aVIsn't life about the journey, not really the destination?
p60
aVAnd here we've been on this journey,
p61
aVand the truth is, it's been thrilling.
p62
aVWe haven't reached that other shore,
p63
aVand still, our sense of pride and commitment,
p64
aVunwavering commitment.
p65
aVWhen I turned 60, the dream was still alive
p66
aVfrom having tried this in my 20s \u2014 dreamed it and imagined it.
p67
aVThe most famous body of water on the Earth today, I imagine,
p68
aVCuba to Florida.
p69
aVAnd it was deep. It was deep in my soul.
p70
aa(lp71
VWhen I turned 60,
p72
aVit wasn't so much about the athletic accomplishment,
p73
aVit wasn't the ego of "I want to be the first."
p74
aVThat's always there and it's undeniable.
p75
aVBut it was deeper.
p76
aVIt was "how much life is there left?"
p77
aVLet's face it \u2014 we're all on a one-way street, aren't we?
p78
aVAnd what are we going to do?
p79
aVWhat are we going to do as we go forward, to have no regrets looking back?
p80
aVAnd all this past year in training,
p81
aVI had that Teddy Roosevelt quote
p82
aVto paraphrase it, floating around in my brain.
p83
aVIt says, "You go ahead.
p84
aVYou go ahead and sit back in your comfortable chair
p85
aVand you be the critic, you be the observer,
p86
aVwhile the brave one gets in the ring and engages
p87
aVand gets bloody and gets dirty and fails over and over and over again,
p88
aVbut yet isn't afraid and isn't timid and lives life in a bold way."
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd so of course I want to make it across.
p91
aVIt is the goal, and I should be so shallow to say that this year,
p92
aVthe destination was even sweeter than the journey.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
V(Applause)
p97
aa(lp98
VBut the journey itself was worthwhile taking.
p99
aVAnd at this point, by this summer,
p100
aVeverybody \u2014 scientists, sports scientists,
p101
aVendurance experts, neurologists,
p102
aVmy own team, Bonnie \u2014
p103
aVsaid it's impossible.
p104
aVIt just simply can't be done, and Bonnie said to me,
p105
aV"But if you're going to take the journey,
p106
aVI'm going to see you through to the end of it,
p107
aVso I'll be there."
p108
aa(lp109
VAnd now we're there.
p110
aVAs we're looking out, kind of a surreal moment
p111
aVbefore the first stroke,
p112
aVstanding on the rocks at Marina Hemingway,
p113
aVthe Cuban flag is flying above,
p114
aVall my team is out in their boats, hands up in the air,
p115
aV"We're here!
p116
aVWe're here for you!"
p117
aVBonnie and I look at each other and say,
p118
aVthis year, the mantra is \u2014 and I've been using it in training \u2014
p119
aVFind a way.
p120
aVYou have a dream
p121
aVand you have obstacles in front of you, as we all do.
p122
aVNone of us ever get through this life
p123
aVwithout heartache,
p124
aVwithout turmoil,
p125
aVand if you believe and you have faith
p126
aVand you can get knocked down and get back up again
p127
aVand you believe in perseverance
p128
aVas a great human quality,
p129
aVyou find your way.
p130
aVAnd Bonnie grabbed my shoulders,
p131
aVand she said, "Let's find our way to Florida."
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd we started, and for the next 53 hours,
p134
aVit was an intense, unforgettable life experience.
p135
aVThe highs were high, the awe \u2014
p136
aVI'm not a religious person, but I'll tell you,
p137
aVto be in the azure blue of the Gulf Stream
p138
aVas if, as you're breathing,
p139
aVyou're looking down miles and miles and miles,
p140
aVto feel the majesty of this blue planet we live on \u2014
p141
aVit's awe-inspiring.
p142
aVI have a playlist of about 85 songs,
p143
aVand especially in the middle of the night ...
p144
aVThat night, because we use no lights \u2014 lights attract jellyfish,
p145
aVlights attract sharks,
p146
aVlights attract baitfish that attract sharks,
p147
aVso we go in the pitch black of the night.
p148
aVYou've never seen black this black.
p149
aVYou can't see the front of your hand,
p150
aVand the people on the boat, Bonnie and my team on the boat \u2014
p151
aVthey just hear the slapping of the arms,
p152
aVand they know where I am,
p153
aVbecause there's no visual at all.
p154
aVAnd I'm out there kind of tripping out on my little playlist.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VI've got tight rubber caps, I don't hear a thing.
p159
aVI've got goggles and I'm turning my head 50 times a minute,
p160
aVand I'm singing ...
p161
aa(lp162
V(Singing) Imagine there's no heaven
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
Vdoo doo doo doo doo
p167
aVIt's easy if you try
p168
aVdoo doo doo doo doo
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd I can sing that song a thousand times in a row.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VNow there's a talent unto itself.
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
V(Applause)
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd each time I get done with,
p181
aa(lp182
V(Singing) Oh, you may say I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one
p183
aa(lp184
V222.
p185
aa(lp186
V(Singing) Imagine there's no heaven
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VAnd when I get through the end
p191
aVof a thousand of John Lennon's "Imagine,"
p192
aVI have swum nine hours and 45 minutes ...
p193
aVexactly.
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd then there are the crises.
p198
aVOf course there are.
p199
aVAnd the vomiting starts, the seawater \u2014 you're not well.
p200
aVYou're wearing a jellyfish mask for the ultimate protection.
p201
aVIt's difficult to swim in.
p202
aVIt's causing abrasions on the inside of the mouth,
p203
aVbut the tentacles can't get you.
p204
aVAnd the hypothermia sets in.
p205
aVThe water's 85 degrees, and yet you're losing weight
p206
aVand using calories.
p207
aVAnd as you come over toward the side of the boat \u2014
p208
aVnot allowed to touch it, not allowed to get out,
p209
aVbut Bonnie and her team hand me nutrition
p210
aVand ask me how I'm doing, am I all right.
p211
aVI am seeing the Taj Mahal \u2014
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VOver here.
p216
aVI'm in a very different state \u2014
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd I'm thinking, "Wow!
p221
aVI never thought I'd be running into the Taj Mahal out here.
p222
aVIt's gorgeous!
p223
aVI mean, how long did it take them to build that?
p224
aVIt's just ...
p225
aVSo, uh \u2014 wooo \u2014 you know?
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VWe kind of have a cardinal rule
p230
aVthat I'm never told how far it is, because we don't know how far it is.
p231
aVWhat's going to happen to you between this point and that point?
p232
aVWhat's going to happen to the weather and the currents
p233
aVand, God forbid, you're stung,
p234
aVwhen you don't think you could be stung in all this armor.
p235
aVBonnie made a decision coming into that third morning
p236
aVthat I was suffering,
p237
aVand I was hanging on by a thread.
p238
aVAnd she said, "Come here,"
p239
aVand I came close to the boat, and she said,
p240
aV"Look, look out there."
p241
aVAnd I saw light,
p242
aVbecause the day is easier than the night,
p243
aVand I thought we were coming into day.
p244
aVI saw a stream of white light along the horizon,
p245
aVand I said, "It's going to be morning soon."
p246
aVAnd she said, "No, those are the lights of Key West."
p247
aVIt was 15 more hours,
p248
aVwhich for most swimmers would be a long time.
p249
aa(lp250
V(Laughter)
p251
aa(lp252
V(Applause)
p253
aa(lp254
VYou have no idea how many 15-hour training swims I had done.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo here we go, and I somehow, without a decision,
p257
aVwent into no counting of strokes
p258
aVand no singing
p259
aVand no quoting Stephen Hawking on the parameters of the universe.
p260
aVI just went into thinking about this dream, and why and how.
p261
aVAs I said, when I turned 60,
p262
aVit wasn't about that concrete "Can you do it?"
p263
aVThat's the everyday machinations.
p264
aVThat's the discipline, and it's the preparation,
p265
aVand there's a pride in that.
p266
aVBut I decided to think, as I went along,
p267
aVabout \u2014 you know, the phrase usually is, "reaching for the stars."
p268
aVAnd in my case, it's reaching for the horizon.
p269
aVAnd when you reach for the horizon,
p270
aVas I've proven, you may not get there.
p271
aVBut what a tremendous build of character and spirit
p272
aVthat you lay down;
p273
aVwhat a foundation you lay down in reaching for those horizons.
p274
aa(lp275
VAnd now, the shore is coming.
p276
aVAnd there's just a little part of me that's sad.
p277
aVThe epic journey is going to be over.
p278
aa(lp279
VSo many people come up to me now and say,
p280
aV"What's next?"
p281
aa(lp282
V(Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
V"We love that!"
p285
aa(lp286
V(Laughter)
p287
aa(lp288
V"That little tracker on the computer?
p289
aVWhen are you going to do the next one?
p290
aVWe can't wait to follow the next one."
p291
aVWell, they were just there for 53 hours,
p292
aVand I was there for years.
p293
aVAnd so there won't be another epic journey in the ocean.
p294
aa(lp295
VBut the point is, and the point was,
p296
aVthat every day of our lives is epic.
p297
aVAnd I'll tell you, when I walked up onto that beach,
p298
aVstaggered up onto that beach ...
p299
aVI had so many times, in a very puffed-up ego way,
p300
aVrehearsed what I would say ...
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
Von the beach.
p305
aVWhen Bonnie thought the back of my throat was swelling up,
p306
aVshe brought the medical team over to our boat
p307
aVto say, "She's really beginning to have trouble breathing;
p308
aVanother 12, 24 hours in the saltwater ..." \u2014
p309
aVthe whole thing \u2014 I just thought, in my hallucinatory moment,
p310
aVthat I heard the word "tracheotomy."
p311
aa(lp312
V(Laughter)
p313
aa(lp314
VBonnie said to the doctor, "I'm not worried about her not breathing.
p315
aVIf she can't talk when she gets to the shore,
p316
aVshe's going to be pissed off."
p317
aa(lp318
V(Laughter)
p319
aa(lp320
VBut the truth is, all those orations that I had practiced,
p321
aVjust to get myself through some training swims as motivation \u2014
p322
aVit wasn't like that.
p323
aVIt was a very real moment,
p324
aVwith that crowd, with my team.
p325
aVWe did it. I didn't do it. We did it.
p326
aVAnd we'll never forget it. It'll always be part of us.
p327
aa(lp328
VThe three things I did sort of blurt out when we got there, was first:
p329
aVNever, ever give up.
p330
aVI live it.
p331
aVWhat's the phrase from today from Socrates?
p332
aa(lp333
VAudience: To be is to do.
p334
aa(lp335
VDiana Nyad: To be is to do.
p336
aVSo I don't stand up and say, "Don't ever give up."
p337
aVI didn't give up.
p338
aVThere was action behind these words.
p339
aa(lp340
VThe second is:
p341
aVYou can chase your dreams at any age; you're never too old.
p342
aVSixty-four; a thing no one, at any age, any gender, could ever do
p343
aVhas done it.
p344
aVAnd there's no doubt in my mind
p345
aVthat I am at the prime of my life today.
p346
aa(lp347
V(Applause)
p348
aa(lp349
VYeah.
p350
aa(lp351
V(Applause)
p352
aa(lp353
VThank you.
p354
aa(lp355
VAnd the third thing I said on that beach was,
p356
aVit looks like the most solitary endeavor in the world,
p357
aVand in many ways, of course, it is.
p358
aVAnd in other ways, and the most important ways,
p359
aVit's a team.
p360
aVAnd if you think I'm a badass, you want to meet Bonnie.
p361
aa(lp362
V(Laughter)
p363
aa(lp364
VBonnie, where are you?
p365
aVWhere are you?
p366
aVThere's Bonnie Stoll.
p367
aa(lp368
V(Applause)
p369
aa(lp370
VMy buddy.
p371
aa(lp372
V(Applause)
p373
aa(lp374
VThe Henry David Thoreau quote goes,
p375
aV"When you achieve your dreams, it's not so much what you get
p376
aVas who you have become in achieving them."
p377
aVAnd yeah, I stand before you now.
p378
aVIn the three months since that swim ended,
p379
aVI've sat down with Oprah,
p380
aVand I've been in President Obama's Oval Office;
p381
aVI've been invited to speak in front of esteemed groups
p382
aVsuch as yourselves;
p383
aVI've signed a wonderful major book contract.
p384
aVAll of that's great, and I don't denigrate it.
p385
aVI'm proud of it all, but the truth is,
p386
aVI'm walking around tall
p387
aVbecause I am that bold, fearless person, and I will be, every day,
p388
aVuntil it's time for these days to be done.
p389
aa(lp390
VThank you very much and enjoy the conference.
p391
aa(lp392
VThank you. Thank you!
p393
aa(lp394
V(Applause)
p395
aa(lp396
VThank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you.
p397
