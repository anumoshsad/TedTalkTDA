VThere's an ancient and universal concept that words have power,
p4
aVthat spells exist,
p5
aVand that if we could only pronounce the right words,
p6
aVthen \u2014 whoosh! \u2014 you know, an avalanche would come
p7
aVand wipe out the hobbits, right?
p8
aVSo this is a very attractive idea,
p9
aVbecause we're very lazy, like the Sorcerer's Apprentice,
p10
aVor the world's greatest computer programmer.
p11
aVThis idea has a lot of traction with us.
p12
aa(lp13
VWe love the idea that words, when pronounced,
p14
aVare little more than pure information,
p15
aVbut they evoke physical action in the real world
p16
aVthat helps us do work.
p17
aVSo, of course, with lots of programmable computers
p18
aVand robots around,
p19
aVthis is an easy thing to picture.
p20
aa(lp21
VHow many of you know what I'm talking about?
p22
aVRaise your right hand.
p23
aVHow many don't know what I'm talking about?
p24
aVRaise your left hand.
p25
aVSo that's great. So that was too easy.
p26
aVYou guys have very insecure computers, OK?
p27
aVSo now the thing is, this is a different kind of spell.
p28
aVThis is a computer program made of zeros and ones.
p29
aVIt can be pronounced on a computer, does something like this.
p30
aVThe important thing is we can write it in a high-level language.
p31
aa(lp32
VA computer magician can write this thing.
p33
aVIt can be compiled into zeros and ones and pronounced by a computer.
p34
aVAnd that's what makes computers powerful,
p35
aVthese high-level languages that can be compiled.
p36
aVAnd so, I'm here to tell you, you don't need a computer
p37
aVto actually have a spell.
p38
aVIn fact, what you can do at the molecular level
p39
aVis that if you encode information \u2014
p40
aVyou encode a spell or program as molecules \u2014
p41
aVthen physics can actually directly interpret that information
p42
aVand run a program.
p43
aa(lp44
VIt's what happens in proteins.
p45
aVWhen this amino-acid sequence gets pronounced as atoms,
p46
aVthese little letters are sticky for each other.
p47
aVIt collapses into a three-dimensional shape that turns it into a nanomachine
p48
aVthat actually cuts DNA.
p49
aVThe interesting thing is that if you change the sequence,
p50
aVyou change the three-dimensional folding.
p51
aVYou get, now, a DNA stapler, instead.
p52
aVThese are the kind of molecular programs we want to be able to write.
p53
aVThe problem is, we don't know
p54
aVthe machine language of proteins or have a compiler for proteins.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo I've joined a growing band of people
p57
aVthat try to make molecular spells using DNA.
p58
aVWe use DNA because it's cheaper, it's easier to handle,
p59
aVit's something we understand really well \u2014
p60
aVso well, in fact, that we think we can actually write
p61
aVprogramming languages for DNA and have molecular compilers.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo then, we think we can do that.
p64
aVOne of my first questions doing this was:
p65
aVHow can you make an arbitrary shape or pattern out of DNA?
p66
aVI decided to use a type of DNA origami,
p67
aVwhere you take a long strand of DNA
p68
aVand fold it into whatever shape or pattern you might want.
p69
aVSo here's a shape.
p70
aVI actually spent about a year in my home in my underwear, coding,
p71
aVlike Linus [Torvalds], in that picture before.
p72
aVThis program takes a shape and spits out 250 DNA sequences.
p73
aVThese short DNA sequences are what are going to fold the long strand
p74
aVinto this shape that we want to make.
p75
aVSo you send an e-mail with these sequences in it
p76
aVto a company,
p77
aVand the company pronounces them on a DNA synthesizer,
p78
aVa machine about the size of a photocopier.
p79
aVAnd they take your e-mail,
p80
aVand every letter in your e-mail, they replace with a 30-atom cluster \u2014
p81
aVone for each letter, A, T, C and G in DNA.
p82
aa(lp83
VThey string them up in the right sequence,
p84
aVand then they send them back to you via FedEx.
p85
aVSo you get 250 of these in the mail in little tubes.
p86
aVI mix them together, add a little bit of salt water,
p87
aVand then add this long strand I was telling you about,
p88
aVthat I've stolen from a virus.
p89
aVAnd then what happens is,
p90
aVyou heat this whole thing up to about boiling.
p91
aVYou cool it down to room temperature,
p92
aVand as you do, those short strands do the following thing:
p93
aVeach one of them binds that long strand in one place,
p94
aVand then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place,
p95
aVand brings those two parts of the long strand
p96
aVclose together so they stick together.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo the net effect of all 250 of these strands
p99
aVis to fold the long strand into the shape you're looking for.
p100
aVIt'll approximate that shape.
p101
aVWe do this for real, in the test tube.
p102
aVIn each little drop of water, you get 50 billion of these guys.
p103
aVWith a microscope, you can see them on a surface.
p104
aVThe neat thing is if you change the sequence and change the spell,
p105
aVjust change the sequence of the staples,
p106
aVyou can make a molecule that looks like this.
p107
aVAnd, you know, he likes to hang out with his buddies.
p108
aVA lot of them are actually pretty good.
p109
aa(lp110
VIf you change the spell again, you change the sequence again,
p111
aVyou get really nice, 130-nanometer triangles.
p112
aVIf you do it again,
p113
aVyou can get arbitrary patterns.
p114
aVSo on a rectangle, you can paint patterns of North and South America,
p115
aVor the words, "DNA."
p116
aa(lp117
VSo that's DNA origami. That's one way.
p118
aVThere are many ways of casting molecular spells using DNA.
p119
aVWhat we really want to do in the end
p120
aVis learn how to program self-assembly so we can build anything, right?
p121
aVWe want to be able to build technological artifacts
p122
aVthat are maybe good for the world.
p123
aVWe want to learn how to build biological artifacts,
p124
aVlike people and whales and trees.
p125
aVAnd if it's the case that we can reach that level of complexity,
p126
aVif our ability to program molecules gets to be that good,
p127
aVthen that will truly be magic.
