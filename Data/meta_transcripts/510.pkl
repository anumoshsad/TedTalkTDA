(lp3
VI am going to talk about myself,
p4
aVwhich I rarely do, because I \u2014
p5
aVwell for one thing, I prefer to talk about things I know nothing about.
p6
aVAnd secondly, I'm a recovering narcissist.
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aVI didn't know I was a narcissist actually.
p9
aVI thought narcissism meant you loved yourself.
p10
aVAnd then someone told me there is a flip side to it.
p11
aVSo it's actually drearier than self-love;
p12
aVit's unrequited self-love.
p13
aV(Laughter)
p14
aVI don't feel I can afford a relapse.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut I want to, though, explain
p17
aVhow I came to design my own particular brand of comedy
p18
aVbecause I've been through so many different forms of it.
p19
aVI started with improvisation,
p20
aVin a particular form of improvisation called theater games,
p21
aVwhich had one rule,
p22
aVwhich I always thought was a great rule for an ethic for a society.
p23
aVAnd the rule was, you couldn't deny the other person's reality,
p24
aVyou could only build on it.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd of course we live in a society that's all about
p27
aVcontradicting other peoples' reality.
p28
aVIt's all about contradiction,
p29
aVwhich I think is why I'm so sensitive to contradiction in general.
p30
aVI see it everywhere.
p31
aVLike polls. You know, it's always curious to me
p32
aVthat in public opinion polls
p33
aVthe percentage of Americans who don't know the answer to any given question
p34
aVis always two percent.
p35
aV75 percent of Americans
p36
aVthink Alaska is part of Canada.
p37
aVBut only two percent don't know the effect
p38
aVthat the debacle in Argentina will have on the IMF's monetary policy \u2014
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVseems a contradiction.
p41
aVOr this ad that I read in the New York Times:
p42
aV"Wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society.
p43
aVBuying it from us screams good taste."
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aVOr this that I found in a magazine called California Lawyer,
p46
aVin an article that is surely meant for the lawyers at Enron.
p47
aV"Surviving the Slammer: Do's and Don'ts."
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aV"Don't use big words."
p50
aV(Laughter)
p51
aV"Learn the lingua franca."
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aVYeah. "Lingua this, Frankie."
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd I suppose it's a contradiction that I
p58
aVtalk about science when I don't know math.
p59
aVYou know, because \u2014 and by the way to I was so grateful to Dean Kamen
p60
aVfor pointing out that one of the reasons,
p61
aVthat there are cultural reasons
p62
aVthat women and minorities don't enter the fields of science and technology \u2014
p63
aVbecause for instance, the reason I don't do math is,
p64
aVI was taught to do math and read at the same time.
p65
aVSo you're six years old, you're reading Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,
p66
aVand it becomes rapidly obvious
p67
aVthat there are only two kinds of men in the world:
p68
aVdwarves and Prince Charmings.
p69
aVAnd the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince.
p70
aV(Laughter)
p71
aVThat's why little girls don't do math. It's too depressing.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VOf course, by talking about science
p76
aVI also may, as I did the other night,
p77
aVincur the violent wrath of some scientists
p78
aVwho were very upset with me.
p79
aVI used the word postmodern as if it were OK.
p80
aVAnd they got very upset.
p81
aVOne of them, to his credit, I think really just wanted to engage me
p82
aVin a serious argument.
p83
aVBut I don't engage in serious arguments.
p84
aVI don't approve of them
p85
aVbecause arguments, of course, are all about contradiction,
p86
aVand they're shaped by the values that I have questions with.
p87
aa(lp88
VI have questions with the values of Newtonian science,
p89
aVlike rationality. You're supposed to be rational in an argument.
p90
aVWell rationality is constructed
p91
aVby what Christie Hefner was talking about today,
p92
aVthat mind-body split, you know?
p93
aVThe head is good, body bad.
p94
aVHead is ego, body id.
p95
aVWhen we say "I," \u2014 as when Rene Descartes said,
p96
aV"I think therefore I am," \u2014
p97
aVwe mean the head.
p98
aVAnd as David Lee Roth sang in "Just a Gigolo,"
p99
aV"I ain't got no body."
p100
aVThat's how you get rationality.
p101
aVAnd that's why so much of humor
p102
aVis the body asserting itself against the head.
p103
aVThat's why you have toilet humor and sexual humor.
p104
aVThat's why you have the Raspyni Brothers
p105
aVwhacking Richard in the genital area.
p106
aVAnd we're laughing doubly then
p107
aVbecause he's the body, but it's also \u2014
p108
aa(lp109
VVoice offstage: Richard.
p110
aa(lp111
VEmily Levine: Richard. What did I say?
p112
aV(Laughter)
p113
aVRichard. Yes but it's also the head,
p114
aVthe head of the conference.
p115
aa(lp116
VThat's the other way that humor \u2014
p117
aVlike Art Buchwald takes shots at the heads of state.
p118
aVIt doesn't make quite as much money as body humor I'm sure \u2014
p119
aV(Laughter)
p120
aVbut nevertheless, what makes us treasure you and adore you.
p121
aa(lp122
VThere's also a contradiction in rationality in this country though,
p123
aVwhich is, as much as we revere the head,
p124
aVwe are very anti-intellectual.
p125
aVI know this because I read in the New York Times,
p126
aVthe Ayn Rand foundation took out a full-page ad
p127
aVafter September 11,
p128
aVin which they said, "The problem is not Iraq or Iran,
p129
aVthe problem in this country, facing this country
p130
aVis the university professors and their spawn."
p131
aV(Laughter)
p132
aVSo I went back and re-read "The Fountainhead."
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVI don't know how many of you have read it.
p135
aVAnd I'm not an expert on sadomasochism.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aVBut let me just read you a couple of random passages from page 217.
p138
aa(lp139
V"The act of a master
p140
aVtaking painful contemptuous possession of her,
p141
aVwas the kind of rapture she wanted.
p142
aVWhen they lay together in bed it was,
p143
aVas it had to be, as the nature of the act demanded,
p144
aVan act of violence.
p145
aVIt was an act of clenched teeth and hatred. It was the unendurable.
p146
aVNot a caress, but a wave of pain.
p147
aVThe agony as an act of passion."
p148
aa(lp149
VSo you can imagine my surprise
p150
aVon reading in The New Yorker
p151
aVthat Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve,
p152
aVclaims Ayn Rand as his intellectual mentor.
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aVIt's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix.
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aVBad enough we had to see J. Edgar Hoover in a dress.
p157
aVNow we have to picture Alan Greenspan
p158
aVin a black leather corset, with a butt tattoo that says,
p159
aV"Whip inflation now."
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd Ayn Rand of course, Ayn Rand
p164
aVis famous for a philosophy called Objectivism,
p165
aVwhich reflects another value of Newtonian physics,
p166
aVwhich is objectivity.
p167
aVObjectivity basically is constructed
p168
aVin that same S&M way.
p169
aVIt's the subject subjugating the object.
p170
aVThat's how you assert yourself.
p171
aVYou make yourself the active voice.
p172
aVAnd the object is the passive no-voice.
p173
aa(lp174
VI was so fascinated by that Oxygen commercial.
p175
aVI don't know if you know this but \u2014
p176
aVmaybe it's different now, or maybe you were making a statement \u2014
p177
aVbut in many hospital nurseries across the country,
p178
aVuntil very recently anyway, according to a book by Jessica Benjamin,
p179
aVthe signs over the little boys cribs read,
p180
aV"I'm a boy,"
p181
aVand the signs over the little girls cribs read,
p182
aV"It's a girl." Yeah.
p183
aVSo the passivity was culturally
p184
aVprojected onto the little girls.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd this still goes on as I think I told you last year.
p187
aVThere's a poll that proves \u2014
p188
aVthere was a poll that was given by Time magazine,
p189
aVin which only men were asked, "Have you ever had sex
p190
aVwith a woman you actively disliked?"
p191
aVAnd well, yeah.
p192
aVWell, 58 percent said yes,
p193
aVwhich I think is overinflated though
p194
aVbecause so many men if you just say,
p195
aV"Have you ever had sex ... " "Yes!"
p196
aVThey don't even wait for the rest of it.
p197
aV(Laughter)
p198
aVAnd of course two percent did not know whether they'd had \u2014
p199
aV(Laughter)
p200
aVThat's the first callback,
p201
aVof my attempted quadruple.
p202
aa(lp203
V(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VSo this subject-object thing,
p206
aVis part of something I'm very interested in
p207
aVbecause this is why, frankly, I believe in political correctness.
p208
aVI do. I think it can go too far.
p209
aVI think Ringling Brothers may have gone too far
p210
aVwith an ad they took out in the New York Times Magazine.
p211
aV"We have a lifelong emotional and financial
p212
aVcommitment to our Asian Elephant partners."
p213
aV(Laughter)
p214
aVMaybe too far. But you know \u2014
p215
aVI don't think that
p216
aVa person of color making fun of white people
p217
aVis the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color.
p218
aVOr women making fun of men is the same as men making fun of women.
p219
aVOr poor people making fun of rich people, the same as rich people.
p220
aa(lp221
VI think you can make fun of the have but not the have-nots,
p222
aVwhich is why you don't see me making fun of
p223
aVKenneth Lay and his charming wife.
p224
aV(Laughter)
p225
aVWhat's funny about being down to four houses?
p226
aV(Laughter)
p227
aVAnd I really learned this lesson
p228
aVduring the sex scandals of the Clinton administration or,
p229
aVOr as I call them, the good ol' days.
p230
aV(Laughter)
p231
aVWhen people I knew, you know, people who considered themselves liberal,
p232
aVand everything else,
p233
aVwere making fun of Jennifer Flowers and Paula Jones.
p234
aVBasically, they were making fun of them for being
p235
aVtrailer trash or white trash.
p236
aVIt seems, I suppose, a harmless prejudice
p237
aVand that you're not really hurting anybody.
p238
aVUntil you read, as I did, an ad in the Los Angeles Times.
p239
aV"For sale: White trash compactor."
p240
aV(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VSo this whole subject-object thing
p243
aVhas relevance to humor in this way.
p244
aVI read a book by a woman named Amy Richlin,
p245
aVwho is the chair of the Classics department at USC.
p246
aVAnd the book is called "The Garden of Priapus."
p247
aVAnd she says that Roman humor
p248
aVmirrors the construction of Roman society.
p249
aVSo that Roman society was very top/bottom,
p250
aVas ours is to some degree.
p251
aVAnd so was humor.
p252
aVThere always had to be the butt of a joke.
p253
aVSo it was always the satirist,
p254
aVlike Juvenal or Martial,
p255
aVrepresented the audience,
p256
aVand he was going to make fun of the outsider,
p257
aVthe person who didn't share that subject status.
p258
aa(lp259
VAnd in stand-up of course,
p260
aVthe stand-up comedian is supposed to dominate the audience.
p261
aVA lot of heckling is the tension
p262
aVof trying to make sure that the
p263
aVcomedian is going to be able to dominate,
p264
aVand overcome the heckler.
p265
aVAnd I got good at that when I was in stand up.
p266
aVBut I always hated it because they were
p267
aVdictating the terms of the interaction,
p268
aVin the same way that engaging in a serious argument
p269
aVdetermines the content, to some degree,
p270
aVof what you're talking about.
p271
aVAnd I was looking for a form
p272
aVthat didn't have that.
p273
aVAnd so I wanted something that was more interactive.
p274
aVI know that word is so debased now
p275
aVby the use of it by Internet marketers.
p276
aa(lp277
VI really miss the old telemarketers now, I'll tell you that.
p278
aV(Laughter)
p279
aVI do, because at least there you stood a chance. You know?
p280
aVI used to actually hang up on them.
p281
aVBut then I read in "Dear Abby" that that was rude.
p282
aVSo the next time that one called
p283
aVI let him get halfway through his spiel and then I said,
p284
aV"You sound sexy."
p285
aV(Laughter)
p286
aVHe hung up on me!
p287
aa(lp288
V(Laughter)
p289
aa(lp290
VBut the interactivity allows the audience
p291
aVto shape what you're going to do as much as
p292
aVyou shape their experience of the world.
p293
aVAnd that's really what I'm looking for.
p294
aVAnd I was sort of, as I was starting to analyze
p295
aVwhat exactly it is that I do,
p296
aVI read a book called "Trickster Makes This World," by Lewis Hyde.
p297
aVAnd it was like being psychoanalyzed.
p298
aVI mean he had laid it all out.
p299
aVAnd then coming to this conference,
p300
aVI realized that most everybody here
p301
aVshared those same qualities
p302
aVbecause really what trickster is
p303
aVis an agent of change.
p304
aVTrickster is a change agent.
p305
aVAnd the qualities that I'm about to describe
p306
aVare the qualities that make it possible
p307
aVto make change happen.
p308
aVAnd one of these is boundary crossing.
p309
aVI think this is what so, in fact, infuriated the scientists.
p310
aVBut I like to cross boundaries.
p311
aVI like to, as I said, talk about things I know nothing about.
p312
aa(lp313
V(Phone Ringing)
p314
aa(lp315
VI hope that's my agent,
p316
aVbecause you aren't paying me anything.
p317
aa(lp318
V(Laughter)
p319
aa(lp320
VAnd I think it's good to talk about things I know nothing about
p321
aVbecause I bring a fresh viewpoint to it, you know?
p322
aVI'm able to see the contradiction
p323
aVthat you may not be able to see.
p324
aVLike for instance a mime once \u2014
p325
aVor a meme as he called himself.
p326
aVHe was a very selfish meme.
p327
aVAnd he said that I had to show more respect
p328
aVbecause it took up to 18 years
p329
aVto learn how to do mime properly.
p330
aVAnd I said, "Well, that's how you know only stupid people go into it."
p331
aV(Laughter)
p332
aVIt only takes two years to learn how to talk.
p333
aa(lp334
V(Laughter)
p335
aa(lp336
V(Applause)
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd you know people, this is the problem with
p339
aVquote, objectivity, unquote.
p340
aVWhen you're only surrounded by people
p341
aVwho speak the same vocabulary as you,
p342
aVor share the same set of assumptions as you,
p343
aVyou start to think that that's reality.
p344
aVLike economists, you know, their definition of rational,
p345
aVthat we all act out of our own economic self-interest.
p346
aVWell, look at Michael Hawley,
p347
aVor look at Dean Kamen,
p348
aVor look at my grandmother.
p349
aa(lp350
VMy grandmother always acted in other people's interests,
p351
aVwhether they wanted her to or not.
p352
aV(Laughter)
p353
aVIf they had had an Olympics in martyrdom,
p354
aVmy grandmother would have lost on purpose.
p355
aV(Laughter)
p356
aV"No, you take the prize.
p357
aVYou're young. I'm old. Who's going to see it?
p358
aVWhere am I going? I'm going to die soon."
p359
aa(lp360
V(Laughter)
p361
aa(lp362
VSo that's one \u2014 this boundary crossing,
p363
aVthis go-between which \u2014
p364
aVFritz Lanting, is that his name,
p365
aVactually said that he was a go-between.
p366
aVThat's an actual quality of the trickster.
p367
aVAnd another is, non-oppositional strategies.
p368
aVAnd this is instead of contradiction.
p369
aVWhere you deny the other person's reality,
p370
aVyou have paradox
p371
aVwhere you allow more than one reality to coexist,
p372
aa(lp373
VI think there's another philosophical construction.
p374
aVI'm not sure what it's called.
p375
aVBut my example of it is a sign that I saw in a jewelry store.
p376
aVIt said, "Ears pierced while you wait."
p377
aV(Laughter)
p378
aVThere the alternative just boggles the imagination.
p379
aV(Laughter)
p380
aV"Oh no. Thanks though, I'll leave them here. Thanks very much.
p381
aVI have some errands to run. So I'll be back to pick them up
p382
aVaround five, if that's OK with you.
p383
aVHuh? Huh? What? Can't hear you."
p384
aa(lp385
V(Laughter)
p386
aa(lp387
VAnd another attribute of the trickster
p388
aVis smart luck.
p389
aVThat accidents, that Louis Kahn, who talked about accidents,
p390
aVthis is another quality of the trickster.
p391
aVThe trickster has a mind that is prepared for the unprepared.
p392
aVThat, and I will say this to the scientists,
p393
aVthat the trickster has the ability to hold
p394
aVhis ideas lightly
p395
aVso that he can let room in for new ideas
p396
aVor to see the contradictions or the hidden problems
p397
aVwith his ideas.
p398
aVI had no joke for that.
p399
aVI just wanted to put the scientists in their place.
p400
aV(Laughter)
p401
aa(lp402
VBut here's how I think I like to make change,
p403
aVand that is in making connections.
p404
aVThis is what I tend to see
p405
aValmost more than contradictions.
p406
aVLike the, what do you call those toes of the gecko?
p407
aVYou know, the toes of the gecko,
p408
aVcurling and uncurling like the fingers of Michael Moschen.
p409
aVI love connections.
p410
aa(lp411
VLike I'll read that one of the two attributes
p412
aVof matter in the Newtonian universe \u2014
p413
aVthere are two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe \u2014
p414
aVone is space occupancy. Matter takes up space.
p415
aVI guess the more you matter the more space you take up,
p416
aVwhich explains the whole SUV phenomenon.
p417
aV(Laughter)
p418
aVAnd the other one though is impenetrability.
p419
aa(lp420
VWell, in ancient Rome, impenetrability
p421
aVwas the criterion of masculinity.
p422
aVMasculinity depended on you
p423
aVbeing the active penetrator.
p424
aVAnd then, in economics, there's an active producer
p425
aVand a passive consumer,
p426
aVwhich explains why business always has to
p427
aVpenetrate new markets.
p428
aVWell yeah, I mean why we forced China
p429
aVto open her markets.
p430
aVAnd didn't that feel good?
p431
aV(Laughter)
p432
aVAnd now we're being penetrated.
p433
aVYou know the biotech companies are actually going inside us
p434
aVand planting their little flags on our genes.
p435
aVYou know we're being penetrated.
p436
aVAnd I suspect, by someone who actively dislikes us.
p437
aV(Laughter)
p438
aVThat's the second of the quadruple.
p439
aVYes of course you got that. Thank you very much.
p440
aVI still have a way to go.
p441
aa(lp442
V(Laughter)
p443
aa(lp444
VAnd what I hope to do, when I make these connections,
p445
aVis short circuit people's thinking.
p446
aVYou know, make you not follow your usual
p447
aVtrain of association,
p448
aVbut make you rewire.
p449
aVIt literally \u2014 when people say about the shock of recognition,
p450
aVit's literally re-cognition, rewiring how you think \u2014
p451
aVI had a joke to go with this and I forgot it.
p452
aVI'm so sorry. I'm getting like
p453
aVthe woman in that joke about \u2014
p454
aa(lp455
Vhave you heard this joke about the woman driving with her mother?
p456
aVAnd the mother is elderly.
p457
aVAnd the mother goes right through a red light.
p458
aVAnd the daughter doesn't want to say anything.
p459
aVShe doesn't want to be like, "You're too old to drive."
p460
aVAnd the mother goes through a second red light.
p461
aVAnd the daughter says, as tactfully as possible,
p462
aV"Mom, are you aware that you just went through two red lights?"
p463
aVAnd the mother says, "Oh! Am I driving?"
p464

p469
aVThat completes the quadruple.

VI just want to say two more things.
p474
aVOne is, another characteristic of trickster
p475
aVis that the trickster has to
p476
aVwalk this fine line.
p477
aVHe has to have poise.
p478
aVAnd you know the biggest hurdle for me,
p479
aVin doing what I do,
p480
aVis constructing my performance
p481
aVso that it's prepared and unprepared.
p482
aVFinding the balance between those things
p483
aVis always dangerous
p484
aVbecause you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared.
p485
aVBut being too prepared doesn't leave room
p486
aVfor the accidents to happen.
p487
aa(lp488
VI was thinking about what Moshe Safdie
p489
aVsaid yesterday about beauty
p490
aVbecause in his book, Hyde says that
p491
aVsometimes trickster can tip over into beauty.
p492
aVBut to do that you have to
p493
aVlose all the other qualities
p494
aVbecause once you're into beauty
p495
aVyou're into a finished thing.
p496
aVYou're into something that
p497
aVoccupies space and inhabits time.
p498
aVIt's an actual thing.
p499
aVAnd it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty.
p500
aVBut if you don't do that,
p501
aVif you allow for the accident to keep on happening,
p502
aVyou have the possibility of getting on a wavelength.
p503
aVI like to think of what I do as a probability wave.
p504
aVWhen you go into beauty the probability wave
p505
aVcollapses into one possibility.
p506
aVAnd I like to explore all the possibilities
p507
aVin the hope that you'll be on the wavelength of your audience.
p508
aa(lp509
VAnd the one final quality I want to say about trickster is
p510
aVthat he doesn't have a home.
p511
aVHe's always on the road.
p512
aVI want to say to you Richard, in closing,
p513
aVthat in TED you've created a home.
p514
aVAnd thank you for inviting me into it.
p515
aVThank you very much.
