VThe most romantic thing to ever happen to me online
p4
aVstarted out the way most things do:
p5
aVwithout me, and not online.
p6
aVOn December 10, 1896, the man on the medal,
p7
aVAlfred Nobel, died.
p8
aVOne hundred years later, exactly, actually,
p9
aVDecember 10, 1996,
p10
aVthis charming lady, Wislawa Szymborska,
p11
aVwon the Nobel Prize for literature.
p12
aVShe's a Polish poet.
p13
aVShe's a big deal, obviously,
p14
aVbut back in '96, I thought I had never heard of her,
p15
aVand when I checked out her work,
p16
aVI found this sweet little poem,
p17
aV"Four in the Morning."
p18
aa(lp19
V"The hour from night to day.
p20
aVThe hour from side to side.
p21
aVThe hour for those past thirty..."
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd it goes on, but as soon as I read this poem,
p24
aVI fell for it hard,
p25
aVso hard, I suspected we must have met
p26
aVsomewhere before.
p27
aVHad I shared an elevator ride with this poem?
p28
aVDid I flirt with this poem
p29
aVin a coffee shop somewhere?
p30
aVI could not place it, and it bugged me,
p31
aVand then in the coming week or two,
p32
aVI would just be watching an old movie,
p33
aVand this would happen.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Video) Groucho Marx: Charlie, you should have come to the first party.
p36
aVWe didn't get home till around four in the morning.
p37
aa(lp38
VRives: My roommates would have the TV on,
p39
aVand this would happen.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Music: Seinfeld theme)
p42
aa(lp43
V(Video) George Costanza: Oh boy,  I was up til four in the morning
p44
aVwatching that Omen trilogy.
p45
aa(lp46
VRives: I would be listening to music,
p47
aVand this would happen.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Video) Elton John: \u266a It's four o'clock in the morning, damn it. \u266a
p50
aa(lp51
VRives: So you can see what was going on, right?
p52
aVObviously, the demigods of coincidence
p53
aVwere just messing with me.
p54
aVSome people get a number stuck in their head,
p55
aVyou may recognize a certain name or a tune,
p56
aVsome people get nothing, but four in the morning
p57
aVwas in me now, but mildly,
p58
aVlike a groin injury.
p59
aVI always assumed it would just go away
p60
aVon its own eventually,
p61
aVand I never talked about it with anybody,
p62
aVbut it did not, and I totally did.
p63
aa(lp64
VIn 2007, I was invited to speak at TED
p65
aVfor the second time,
p66
aVand since I was still an authority on nothing,
p67
aVI thought, what if I made a multimedia presentation
p68
aVon a topic so niche
p69
aVit is actually inconsequential
p70
aVor actually cockamamie.
p71
aVSo my talk had some of my four in the morning examples,
p72
aVbut it also had examples
p73
aVfrom my fellow TED speakers that year.
p74
aVI found four in the morning in a novel
p75
aVby Isabel Allende.
p76
aVI found a really great one
p77
aVin the autobiography of Bill Clinton.
p78
aVI found a couple in the work of Matt Groening,
p79
aValthough Matt Groening told me later
p80
aVthat he could not make my talk
p81
aVbecause it was a morning session
p82
aVand I gather that he is not an early riser.
p83
aVHowever, had Matt been there,
p84
aVhe would have seen this mock conspiracy theory
p85
aVthat was un-freaking-canny for me to assemble.
p86
aVIt was totally contrived
p87
aVjust for that room, just for that moment.
p88
aVThat's how we did it in the pre-TED.com days.
p89
aVIt was fun. That was pretty much it.
p90
aa(lp91
VWhen I got home, though, the emails started coming in
p92
aVfrom people who had seen the talk live,
p93
aVbeginning with, and this is still my favorite,
p94
aV"Here's another one for your collection:
p95
aV'It's the friends you can call up at 4 a.m. that matter.'"
p96
aVThe sentiment is Marlene Dietrich.
p97
aVThe email itself was from another very
p98
aVsexy European type,
p99
aVTED Curator Chris Anderson.
p100
aV(Laughter)
p101
aVChris found this quote
p102
aVon a coffee cup or something,
p103
aVand I'm thinking, this man is the Typhoid Mary
p104
aVof ideas worth spreading, and I have infected him.
p105
aVI am contagious,
p106
aVwhich was confirmed less than a week later
p107
aVwhen a Hallmark employee scanned and sent
p108
aVan actual greeting card
p109
aVwith that same quotation.
p110
aVAs a bonus, she hooked me up with a second one they make.
p111
aVIt says, "Just knowing I can call you
p112
aVat four in the morning if I need to
p113
aVmakes me not really need to,"
p114
aVwhich I love, because together these are like,
p115
aV"Hallmark: When you care enough
p116
aVto send the very best twice,
p117
aVphrased slightly differently."
p118
aa(lp119
VI was not surprised at the TEDster
p120
aVand New Yorker magazine overlap.
p121
aVA bunch of people sent me this when it came out.
p122
aV"It's 4 a.m.\u2014maybe you'd sleep better if you bought some crap."
p123
aa(lp124
VI was surprised at the TEDster/"Rugrats" overlap.
p125
aVMore than one person sent me this.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Video) Didi Pickles: It's four o'clock in the morning.
p128
aVWhy on Earth are you making chocolate pudding?
p129
aa(lp130
VStu Pickles: Because I've lost control of my life.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VRives: And then there was the lone TEDster
p135
aVwho was disgruntled I had overlooked
p136
aVwhat he considers to be a classic.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Video) Roy Neary: Get up, get up! I'm not kidding. Ronnie Neary: Is there an accident?
p139
aa(lp140
VRoy: No, it's not an accident. You wanted to get out of the house anyway, right?
p141
aa(lp142
VRonnie: Not at four o'clock in the morning.
p143
aa(lp144
VRives: So that's "Close Encounters,"
p145
aVand the main character is all worked up
p146
aVbecause aliens, momentously,
p147
aVhave chosen to show themselves to earthlings
p148
aVat four in the morning,
p149
aVwhich does make that a very solid example.
p150
aVThose were all really solid examples.
p151
aVThey did not get me any closer to understanding
p152
aVwhy I thought I recognized this one particular poem.
p153
aVBut they followed the pattern. They played along.
p154
aVRight? Four in the morning as this scapegoat hour
p155
aVwhen all these dramatic occurrences
p156
aVallegedly occur.
p157
aVMaybe this was some kind of cliche
p158
aVthat had never been taxonomized before.
p159
aVMaybe I was on the trail
p160
aVof a new meme or something.
p161
aa(lp162
VJust when things were getting pretty interesting,
p163
aVthings got really interesting.
p164
aVTED.com launched, later that year,
p165
aVwith a bunch of videos from past talks,
p166
aVincluding mine,
p167
aVand I started receiving "four in the morning" citations
p168
aVfrom what seemed like every time zone on the planet.
p169
aVMuch of it was content I never would have found
p170
aVon my own if I was looking for it,
p171
aVand I was not.
p172
aVI don't know anybody with juvenile diabetes.
p173
aVI probably would have missed the booklet,
p174
aV"Grilled Cheese at Four O'Clock in the Morning."
p175
aV(Laughter)
p176
aVI do not subscribe to Crochet Today! magazine,
p177
aValthough it looks delightful. (Laughter)
p178
aVTake note of those clock ends.
p179
aVThis is a college student's suggestion
p180
aVfor what a "four in the morning" gang sign
p181
aVshould look like.
p182
aVPeople sent me magazine ads.
p183
aVThey took photographs in grocery stores.
p184
aVI got a ton of graphic novels and comics.
p185
aVA lot of good quality work, too:
p186
aV"The Sandman," "Watchmen."
p187
aVThere's a very cute example here from "Calvin and Hobbes."
p188
aVIn fact, the oldest citation anybody sent in
p189
aVwas from a cartoon from the Stone Age.
p190
aVTake a look.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Video) Wilma Flintstone: Like how early?
p193
aa(lp194
VFred Flintstone: Like at 4 a.m., that's how early.
p195
aa(lp196
VRives: And the flip side of the timeline,
p197
aVthis is from the 31st century.
p198
aVA thousand years from now,
p199
aVpeople are still doing this.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Video): Announcer: The time is 4 a.m.
p202
aV(Laughter)
p203
aVRives: It shows the spectrum.
p204
aVI received so many songs, TV shows, movies,
p205
aVlike from dismal to famous,
p206
aVI could give you a four-hour playlist.
p207
aVIf I just stick to modern male movie stars,
p208
aVI keep it to the length
p209
aVof about a commercial.
p210
aVHere's your sampler.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Movie montage of "It's 4 a.m.")
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VRives: So somewhere along the line,
p217
aVI realized I have a hobby
p218
aVI didn't know I wanted,
p219
aVand it is crowdsourced.
p220
aVBut I was also thinking what you might be thinking,
p221
aVwhich is really, couldn't you do this
p222
aVwith any hour of the day?
p223
aa(lp224
VFirst of all, you are not getting clips like that
p225
aVabout four in the afternoon.
p226
aVSecondly, I did a little research.
p227
aVYou know, I was kind of interested.
p228
aVIf this is confirmation bias,
p229
aVthere is so much confirmation, I am biased.
p230
aVLiterature probably shows it best.
p231
aVThere are a couple three in the mornings in Shakespeare.
p232
aVThere's a five in the morning.
p233
aVThere are seven four in the mornings,
p234
aVand they're all very dire.
p235
aVIn "Measure for Measure," it's the call time for the executioner.
p236
aVTolstoy gives Napoleon insomnia
p237
aVat four in the morning right before battle
p238
aVin "War and Peace."
p239
aVCharlotte Brontë's "Jane Eyre" has got kind of
p240
aVa pivotal four in the morning,
p241
aVas does Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights."
p242
aV"Lolita" has as a creepy four in the morning.
p243
aV"Huckleberry Finn" has one in dialect.
p244
aVSomeone sent in H.G. Wells' "The Invisible Man."
p245
aVSomeone else sent in Ralph Ellison's "Invisible Man."
p246
aV"The Great Gatsby" spends the last
p247
aVfour in the morning of his life
p248
aVwaiting for a lover who never shows,
p249
aVand the most famous wake-up in literature, perhaps,
p250
aV"The Metamorphosis."
p251
aVFirst paragraph, the main character wakes up
p252
aVtransformed into a giant cockroach,
p253
aVbut we already know, cockroach notwithstanding,
p254
aVsomething is up with this guy.
p255
aVWhy? His alarm is set for four o'clock in the morning.
p256
aVWhat kind of person would do that?
p257
aVThis kind of person would do that.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Music)
p260
aa(lp261
V(4 a.m. alarm clock montage)
p262
aV(Video) Newcaster: Top of the hour. Time for the morning news.
p263
aVBut of course, there is no news yet.
p264
aVEveryone's still asleep in their comfy, comfy beds.
p265
aa(lp266
VRives: Exactly.
p267
aVSo that's Lucy from the Peanuts,
p268
aV"Mommie Dearest", Rocky, first day of training,
p269
aVNelson Mandela, first day in office,
p270
aVand Bart Simpson, which combined with a cockroach
p271
aVwould give you one hell of a dinner party
p272
aVand gives me yet another category,
p273
aVpeople waking up, in my big old database.
p274
aa(lp275
VJust imagine that your friends and your family
p276
aVhave heard that you collect, say, stuffed polar bears,
p277
aVand they send them to you.
p278
aVEven if you don't really, at a certain point,
p279
aVyou totally collect stuffed polar bears,
p280
aVand your collection is probably pretty kick-ass.
p281
aVAnd when I got to that point, I embraced it.
p282
aVI got my curator on. I started fact checking,
p283
aVdownloading, illegally screen-grabbing.
p284
aVI started archiving.
p285
aVMy hobby had become a habit,
p286
aVand my habit gave me possibly the world's
p287
aVmost eclectic Netflix queue.
p288
aVAt one point, it went, "Guys and Dolls: The Musical,"
p289
aV"Last Tango in Paris,"
p290
aV"Diary of a Wimpy Kid,"
p291
aV"Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy."
p292
aVWhy "Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy"?
p293
aVBecause someone told me I would find this clip in there.
p294
aa(lp295
V(Video) Ron Jeremy: I was born
p296
aVin Flushing, Queens
p297
aVon March, 12, 1953,
p298
aVat four o'clock in the morning.
p299
aa(lp300
VRives: Of course he was. (Laughter) (Applause)
p301
aVYeah. Not only does it seem to make sense,
p302
aVit also answers the question,
p303
aV"What do Ron Jeremy and Simone de Beauvoir
p304
aVhave in common?"
p305
aVSimone de Beauvoir begins her entire autobiography
p306
aVwith the sentence, "I was born at four o'clock in the morning,"
p307
aVwhich I had because someone else had emailed it to me,
p308
aVand when they did, I had another bump up
p309
aVin my entry for this, because porn star Ron Jeremy
p310
aVand feminist Simone de Beauvoir
p311
aVare not just different people.
p312
aVThey are different people that have this thing connecting them,
p313
aVand I did not know if that is trivia or knowledge
p314
aVor inadvertent expertise, but I did wonder,
p315
aVis there maybe a cooler way to do this?
p316
aa(lp317
VSo last October, in gentleman scholar tradition,
p318
aVI put the entire collection online
p319
aVas "Museum of Four in the Morning."
p320
aVYou can click on that red "refresh" button.
p321
aVIt will take you at random to one of
p322
aVhundreds of snippets that are in the collection.
p323
aVHere is a knockout poem
p324
aVby Billy Collins called "Forgetfulness."
p325
aa(lp326
V(Video) Billy Collins: No wonder you rise
p327
aVin the middle of the night
p328
aVto look up the date of a famous battle
p329
aVin a book on war.
p330
aVNo wonder the moon in the window
p331
aVseems to have drifted out of a love poem
p332
aVthat you used to know by heart.
p333
aa(lp334
VRives: So the first hour of this project
p335
aVwas satisfying.
p336
aVA Bollywood actor sang a line on a DVD in a cafe.
p337
aVHalf a globe away, a teenager
p338
aVmade an Instagram video of it and sent it to me,
p339
aVa stranger.
p340
aa(lp341
VLess than a week later, though,
p342
aVI received a little bit of grace.
p343
aVI received a poignant tweet.
p344
aVIt was brief.
p345
aVIt just said, "Reminds me of an ancient mix tape."
p346
aa(lp347
VThe name was a pseudonym, actually, or a pseudo-pseudonym.
p348
aVAs soon as I saw the initials, and the profile pic,
p349
aVI knew immediately, my whole body knew
p350
aVimmediately who this was,
p351
aVand I knew immediately
p352
aVwhat mix tape she was talking about.
p353
aV(Music)
p354
aa(lp355
VL.D. was my college romance.
p356
aVThis is in the early '90s. I was an undegrad.
p357
aVShe was a grad student in the library sciences department.
p358
aVNot the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off,
p359
aVlets her hair down, suddenly she's smoking hot.
p360
aVShe was already smoking hot,
p361
aVshe was super dorky,
p362
aVand we had a December-May romance,
p363
aVmeaning we started dating in December,
p364
aVand by May, she had graduated
p365
aVand became my one that got away.
p366
aa(lp367
VBut her mix tape did not get away.
p368
aVI have kept this mix tape in a box
p369
aVwith notes and postcards, not just from L.D.,
p370
aVfrom my life, but for decades.
p371
aVIt's the kind of box where,
p372
aVif I have a girlfriend, I tend to hide it from her,
p373
aVand if I had a wife, I'm sure I would share it with her,
p374
aVbut the story \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 with this mix tape
p375
aVis there are seven songs per side,
p376
aVbut no song titles.
p377
aVInstead, L.D. has used the U.S. Library of Congress
p378
aVclassification system, including page numbers,
p379
aVto leave me clues.
p380
aVWhen I got this mix tape,
p381
aVI put it in my cassette player,
p382
aVI took it to the campus library, her library,
p383
aVI found 14 books on the shelves.
p384
aVI remember bringing them all
p385
aVto my favorite corner table,
p386
aVand I read poems paired to songs
p387
aVlike food to wine,
p388
aVpaired, I can tell you,
p389
aVlike saddle shoes
p390
aVto a cobalt blue vintage cotton dress.
p391
aa(lp392
VI did this again last October.
p393
aVI'm sitting there, I got new earbuds,
p394
aVold Walkman, I realize this is just the kind
p395
aVof extravagance I used to take for granted
p396
aVeven when I was extravagant.
p397
aVAnd then I thought, "Good for him."
