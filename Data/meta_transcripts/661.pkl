VThirteen trillion dollars in wealth
p4
aVhas evaporated over the course of the last two years.
p5
aVWe've questioned the future of capitalism.
p6
aVWe've questioned the financial industry.
p7
aVWe've looked at our government oversight.
p8
aVWe've questioned where we're going.
p9
aVAnd yet, at the same time,
p10
aVthis very well may be a seminal moment in American history,
p11
aVan opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us
p12
aVto a new trajectory in America.
p13
aa(lp14
VI'm calling this The Great Unwind.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd the idea is a simple, simple idea,
p19
aVwhich is the fact that the consumer has moved from a state of anxiety
p20
aVto action.
p21
aVConsumers who represent 72 percent of the GDP of America
p22
aVhave actually started, just like banks and just like businesses,
p23
aVto de-leverage, to unwind their leverage in daily life,
p24
aVto remove themselves from the liability and risk
p25
aVthat presents itself as they move forward.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo, to understand this \u2014 and I'm going to stress this \u2014
p28
aVit's not about the consumer being in retreat.
p29
aVThe consumer is empowered.
p30
aVTo understand this, we'll step back and look at what's happened
p31
aVover the last year and a half.
p32
aVSo if you've been gone, this is the CliffsNotes
p33
aVon what's happened in the economy.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VUnemployment up. Housing values down. Equity markets down.
p38
aVCommodity prices are like this.
p39
aa(lp40
VIf you're a mom trying to manage a budget,
p41
aVand oil was 150 dollars a barrel last summer,
p42
aVand it's somewhere between 50 and 70,
p43
aVdo you plan vacations?
p44
aVHow do you buy?
p45
aVWhat's your strategy in your household? Will the bailout work?
p46
aVWe have national debt, Detroit, currency valuations, health care \u2014
p47
aVall these issues facing us.
p48
aVYou put them all together, mix them up in a bouillabaisse,
p49
aVand you have consumer confidence that's basically a ticking time bomb.
p50
aa(lp51
VIn fact, let's go back and look at what caused this crisis,
p52
aVbecause the consumer, all of us, in our daily lives,
p53
aVactually contributed a large part to the problem.
p54
aVThis is something I call the 50-20 paradox.
p55
aVIt took us 50 years
p56
aVto reach annual savings ratings of almost 10 percent.
p57
aVFifty years.
p58
aVDo you know what this was right here? This was World War II.
p59
aVDo you know why savings was so high?
p60
aVThere was nothing to buy, unless you wanted to buy some rivets.
p61
aa(lp62
VWhat happened, though, over the course of the last 20 years,
p63
aVwe went from a 10 percent savings rate to a negative savings rate.
p64
aVBecause we binged.
p65
aVWe bought extra-large cars, supersized everything,
p66
aVwe bought remedies for restless leg syndrome.
p67
aVAll these things together basically created a factor
p68
aVwhere the consumer drove us headlong into the crisis
p69
aVthat we face today.
p70
aVThe personal debt-to-income ratio basically went from 65 to 135 percent
p71
aVin the span of about 15 years.
p72
aVSo consumers got over-leveraged.
p73
aVAnd of course our banks did as well, as did our federal government.
p74
aa(lp75
VThis is an absolutely staggering chart.
p76
aVIt shows leverage, trended out from 1919 to 2009.
p77
aVAnd what you end up seeing is the whole phenomenon
p78
aVthat we are actually stepping forth and basically leveraging
p79
aVfuture education, future children in our households.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo if you look at this in the context of visualizing the bailout,
p82
aVwhat you can see is, if you stack up dollar bills,
p83
aVfirst of all, 360,000 dollars
p84
aVis about the size of a five-foot-four guy.
p85
aVBut if you stack it up, you see this amazing, staggering amount of dollars
p86
aVthat have been put into the system to fund and bail us out.
p87
aVSo this is the first 315 billion.
p88
aVBut I read this fact the other day,
p89
aVthat one trillion seconds equals 32,000 years.
p90
aVSo if you think about that,
p91
aVthe context, the casualness with which we talk about
p92
aVtrillion-dollar bailout here and trillion there,
p93
aVwe are stacking ourselves up for long-term leverage.
p94
aa(lp95
VHowever, consumers have moved.
p96
aVThey are taking responsibility.
p97
aVWhat we're seeing is an uptake in the savings rate.
p98
aVIn fact, 11 straight months of savings have happened
p99
aVsince the beginning of the crisis.
p100
aVWe're working our way back up to that 10 percent.
p101
aVAlso, remarkably, in the fourth quarter,
p102
aVspending dropped to its lowest level in 62 years \u2014
p103
aValmost a 3.7 percent decline.
p104
aa(lp105
VVisa now reports that more people are using debit cards than credit cards.
p106
aVSo we're starting to pay for things with money that we have.
p107
aVAnd we're starting to be much more careful about how we save and invest.
p108
aVBut that's not really the whole story,
p109
aVbecause this has also been a dramatic time of transformation.
p110
aVAnd you've got to admit, over the last year and a half,
p111
aVconsumers have been doing some weird things.
p112
aVIt's pretty staggering, what we've lived through.
p113
aVIf you take into account that 80 percent of all Americans
p114
aVwere born after World War II,
p115
aVthis was essentially our Depression.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd so, as a result, some crazy things have happened.
p118
aVI'll give you some examples.
p119
aVLet's talk about dentists, vasectomies, guns and shark attacks.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VDentists report molars \u2014 people grinding their teeth,
p124
aVcoming in and reporting that they've had stress.
p125
aVSo there's an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced.
p126
aVGun sales, according to the FBI, who does background checks,
p127
aVare up almost 25 percent since January.
p128
aVVasectomies are up 48 percent, according to the Cornell Institute.
p129
aVAnd lastly, but a very good point,
p130
aVhopefully not related to the former point I just made,
p131
aVwhich is that shark attacks are at their lowest level from 2003.
p132
aVDoes anybody know why?
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VNo one's at the beach.
p137
aVSo there's a bright side to everything.
p138
aa(lp139
VBut seriously, what we see happening,
p140
aVand the reason I want to stress that the consumer is not in retreat,
p141
aVis that this is a tremendous opportunity
p142
aVfor the consumer who drove us into this recession
p143
aVto lead us right back out.
p144
aVWhat I mean by that is we can move from mindless consumption
p145
aVto mindful consumption.
p146
aVRight?
p147
aa(lp148
V(Applause)
p149
aa(lp150
VIf you think about the last three decades,
p151
aVthe consumer has moved from savvy about marketing in the '90s,
p152
aVto gathering all these amazing social and search tools in this decade.
p153
aVBut the one thing holding them back is the ability to discriminate.
p154
aVBy restricting their demand,
p155
aVconsumers can actually align their values with their spending,
p156
aVand drive capitalism and business to not just be about more,
p157
aVbut to be about better.
p158
aa(lp159
VWe're going to explain that right now.
p160
aVBased on Y&R's BrandAsset Valuator,
p161
aVproprietary tool of VML and Young & Rubicam,
p162
aVwe set out to understand what's been happening in the crisis
p163
aVwith the consumer marketplace.
p164
aVWe found a couple of really interesting things.
p165
aVWe're going to go through four value shifts
p166
aVthat we see driving new consumer behaviors,
p167
aVthat offer new management principles.
p168
aa(lp169
VThe first cultural value shift we see
p170
aVis this tendency toward something we call "liquid life."
p171
aVThis is the movement
p172
aVfrom Americans defining their success on having things
p173
aVto having liquidity,
p174
aVbecause the less excess that you have around you,
p175
aVthe more nimble and fleet of foot you are.
p176
aVAs a result, déclassé consumption is in.
p177
aVDéclassé consumption is the whole idea that spending money frivolously
p178
aVmakes you look a little bit anti-fashion.
p179
aVThe management principle is dollars and cents.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo let's look at some examples of this déclassé consumption
p182
aVthat falls out of this value.
p183
aVThe first thing is, something must be happening
p184
aVwhen P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling.
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VBut seriously, we also have this phenomenon
p189
aVon Madison Avenue and in other places,
p190
aVwhere people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques
p191
aVwith ordinary, generic paper bags to hide the brand purchases.
p192
aVWe see high-end haggling in fashion today,
p193
aVhigh-end haggling for luxury and real estate.
p194
aVWe also see just a relaxing of ego,
p195
aVand sort of a dismantling of artifice.
p196
aa(lp197
VThis is a story on the yacht club that's all basically blue collar.
p198
aVBlue-collar yacht club \u2014 where you can join,
p199
aVbut you've got to work in the boatyard as condition of membership.
p200
aVWe also see the trend toward tourism that's a little bit more low-key:
p201
aVagritourism \u2014 going to vineyards and going to farms.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd then we also see this movement forward from dollars and cents.
p204
aVWhat businesses can do to connect with these new mindsets
p205
aVis really interesting.
p206
aVA couple things that are kind of cool.
p207
aVOne is that Frito-Lay figured out this liquidity thing with their consumer.
p208
aVThey found their consumer had more money at the beginning of the month,
p209
aVless at the end of the month.
p210
aVSo they started to change their packaging:
p211
aVlarger packs at the beginning of the month,
p212
aVsmaller packaging at the end of the month.
p213
aa(lp214
VReally interestingly, too, was the San Francisco Giants.
p215
aVThey've just instituted dynamic pricing.
p216
aVIt takes into account everything from the pitcher match-ups,
p217
aVto the weather, to the team records,
p218
aVin setting prices for the consumer.
p219
aVAnother quick example of these types of movements is the rise of Zynga.
p220
aVZynga has risen on the consumer's desire
p221
aVto not want to be locked in to fixed cost.
p222
aVAgain, this theme is about variable cost, variable living.
p223
aVSo micro-payments have become huge.
p224
aVAnd lastly, some people are using Hulu
p225
aVas a device to get rid of their cable bill.
p226
aVSo, really clever ideas there that are being taken ahold of
p227
aVand that marketers are starting to understand.
p228
aa(lp229
VThe second of the four values is this movement toward
p230
aVethics and fair play.
p231
aVWe see that play itself out with empathy and respect.
p232
aVThe consumer is demanding it.
p233
aVAnd, as a result, businesses must provide not only value,
p234
aVbut values.
p235
aVIncreasingly, consumers are looking at the culture of the company,
p236
aVat their conduct in the marketplace.
p237
aVSo we see with empathy and respect
p238
aVlots of really hopeful things come out of this recession.
p239
aVI'll give you a few examples.
p240
aa(lp241
VOne is the rise toward communities and neighborhoods,
p242
aVand increased emphasis on your neighbors as your support system.
p243
aVAlso, a wonderful by-product of a really lousy thing,
p244
aVwhich has been unemployment,
p245
aVis a rise in volunteerism that's been noted in our country.
p246
aVWe also see the phenomenon \u2014 some of you may have "boomerang kids" \u2014
p247
aVthese are "boomerang alumni,"
p248
aVwhere universities are actually reconnecting with alumni
p249
aVand helping them with jobs, sharing skills and retraining.
p250
aVWe also talked about character and professionalism.
p251
aVWe had this miracle on the Hudson in New York City in January,
p252
aVand suddenly Sully has become a key name on BabyCenter.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
VSo, from a value and values standpoint,
p257
aVwhat companies can do is connect in lots of different ways.
p258
aVMicrosoft is doing something wonderful.
p259
aVThey are actually vowing to retrain two million Americans with IT training,
p260
aVusing their existing infrastructure to do something good.
p261
aa(lp262
VAlso, a really interesting company is GORE-TEX.
p263
aVGORE-TEX is all about personal accountability
p264
aVof their management and their employees,
p265
aVto the point where they really kind of shun the idea of bosses.
p266
aVBut they also talk about the fact that their executives \u2014
p267
aVall of their expense reports are put onto their company intranet
p268
aVfor everyone to see.
p269
aVComplete transparency.
p270
aVThink twice before you have that bottle of wine.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VThe third of the four laws of post-crisis consumerism
p275
aVis about durable living.
p276
aVWe're seeing in our data that consumers are realizing
p277
aVthis is a marathon, not a sprint.
p278
aVThey're digging in and looking for ways to extract value
p279
aVout of every purchase they make.
p280
aVWitness the fact that Americans are holding on to their cars
p281
aVlonger than ever before: 9.4 years on average, in March.
p282
aVA record.
p283
aVWe also see the fact that libraries have become a huge resource for America.
p284
aVDid you know that 68 percent of Americans now carry a library card?
p285
aVThe highest percentage ever in our nation's history.
p286
aa(lp287
VSo what you see in this trend is also the accumulation of knowledge.
p288
aVContinuing education is up.
p289
aVEverything is focused on betterment, training,
p290
aVdevelopment and moving forward.
p291
aVWe also see a big DIY movement.
p292
aVI was fascinated to learn that 30 percent of all homes in America
p293
aVare actually built by owners.
p294
aVThat includes cottages and the like,
p295
aVbut 30 percent.
p296
aVPeople are getting their hands dirty, rolling up their sleeves.
p297
aVThey want these skills.
p298
aa(lp299
VWe see it with the phenomenon of raising backyard hens, chickens and ducks.
p300
aVAnd when you work out the math, they say it doesn't work,
p301
aVbut the principle is there;
p302
aVit's about being sustainable and taking care of yourself.
p303
aVThen we look at the High Line in New York City,
p304
aVan excellent use of reimagining existing infrastructure
p305
aVfor something good,
p306
aVwhich is a brand-new park in New York City.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo what brands can do, and companies, is pay dividends to consumers,
p309
aVbe a brand that lasts,
p310
aVoffer transparency,
p311
aVpromise you're going to be there beyond today's sale.
p312
aVPerfect example of that is Patagonia.
p313
aVPatagonia's "Footprint Chronicles"
p314
aVbasically goes through and tracks every product they make,
p315
aVand gives you social responsibility,
p316
aVand helps you understand the ethics behind the product they make.
p317
aa(lp318
VAnother great example is Fidelity.
p319
aVRather than instant cash-back rewards on your credit or debit purchases,
p320
aVthis is about 529 rewards for your student education.
p321
aVOr the interesting company Sunrun.
p322
aVI love this company.
p323
aVThey've created a consumer collective
p324
aVwhere they put solar panels on households
p325
aVand create a consumer-based utility,
p326
aVwhere the electricity they generate
p327
aVis basically pumped back out into the marketplace.
p328
aVSo it's a consumer-driven co-op.
p329
aa(lp330
VThe fourth post-crisis consumerism that we see
p331
aVis this movement about "return to the fold."
p332
aVIt's incredibly important right now.
p333
aVTrust is not parceled out, as we all know.
p334
aVIt's now about connecting to your communities,
p335
aVconnecting to your social networks.
p336
aVIn my book, I talked about the fact
p337
aVthat 72 percent of people trust what other people say
p338
aVabout a brand or a company,
p339
aVversus 15 percent on advertising.
p340
aVSo in that respect, cooperative consumerism has really taken off.
p341
aVThis is about consumers working together to get what they want
p342
aVout of the marketplace.
p343
aVLet's look at a couple of quick examples.
p344
aa(lp345
VThe artisanal movement is huge:
p346
aVeverything about locally derived products and services,
p347
aVsupporting your local neighborhoods,
p348
aVwhether it's cheeses, wines and other products.
p349
aVAlso this rise of local currencies.
p350
aVRealizing that it's difficult to get loans in this environment,
p351
aVyou're doing business with people you trust
p352
aVin your local markets.
p353
aVSo this rise of local currency is another really interesting phenomenon.
p354
aVAnd then they did a recent report I thought was fascinating.
p355
aVThey actually started, in certain communities in the United States,
p356
aVto publish people's electricity usage.
p357
aVAnd what they found out is when that was available for public record,
p358
aVthe people's electricity usage in those communities dropped.
p359
aa(lp360
VThen we also look at the idea of cow-pooling,
p361
aVwhich is the whole phenomenon of consumers organizing together
p362
aVto buy meat from organic farms, that they know is safe and controlled
p363
aVin the way that they want it to be controlled.
p364
aVAnd then there's this other really interesting movement in California,
p365
aVwhich is about carrot mobs.
p366
aVThe traditional thing would be to boycott, right? Have a stick.
p367
aVWell, why not have a carrot?
p368
aVSo these are consumers organizing, pooling their resources
p369
aVto incentify companies to do good.
p370
aa(lp371
VAnd then we look at what companies can do.
p372
aVThis is all the opportunity about being a community organizer.
p373
aVYou have to realize that you can't fight and control this.
p374
aVYou actually need to organize it.
p375
aVYou need to harness it. You need to give it meaning.
p376
aVAnd there's lots of really interesting examples here.
p377
aVFirst is just the rise of the fact that Zagat's has actually moved out of
p378
aVand diversified from rating restaurants,
p379
aVinto actually rating health care.
p380
aVSo what credentials does Zagat's have?
p381
aVWell, they have a lot,
p382
aVbecause it's their network of people.
p383
aVSo that becomes a very powerful force for them
p384
aVto make their brand more elastic.
p385
aa(lp386
VThen you look at the phenomenon of Kogi.
p387
aVThis Kogi doesn't exist. It's a moving truck.
p388
aVIt's a moving truck through L.A.,
p389
aVand the only way you can find it is through Twitter.
p390
aa(lp391
V(Laughter)
p392
aa(lp393
VOr you look at
p394
aVJohnson & Johnson's "Momversations," a phenomenal blog that's been built up,
p395
aVwhere J&J basically is tapping into the power of mommy bloggers,
p396
aVallowing them to create a forum where they can communicate and connect.
p397
aVAnd it's also become a very valuable advertising revenue for J&J as well.
p398
aVThis, plus the fact that you've got phenomenal work from CEOs,
p399
aVfrom Ford to Zappos, connecting on Twitter,
p400
aVcreating an open environment,
p401
aVallowing their employees to be part of the process,
p402
aVrather than hidden behind walls.
p403
aa(lp404
VYou see this rising force in total transparency and openness
p405
aVthat companies are starting to adopt,
p406
aVall because the consumer is demanding it.
p407
aVSo when we look at this and step back,
p408
aVwhat I believe is that the crisis that exists today is definitely real.
p409
aVIt's been tremendously powerful for consumers.
p410
aVBut at the same time, this is also a tremendous opportunity.
p411
aVThe Chinese character for crisis is actually the same side
p412
aVof the same coin.
p413
aVCrisis equals opportunity.
p414
aVWhat we're seeing with consumers right now is the ability for them
p415
aVto actually lead us forward out of this recession.
p416
aa(lp417
VSo we believe that values-driven spending will force capitalism to be better:
p418
aVit will drive innovation;
p419
aVit will make longer-lasting products;
p420
aVit will create better, more intuitive customer service;
p421
aVand it will give us the opportunity to connect with companies
p422
aVthat share the values that we share.
p423
aVSo when we look back and step out at this
p424
aVand see the beginning of these trends that we're seeing in our data,
p425
aVwe see a very hopeful picture for the future of America.
p426
