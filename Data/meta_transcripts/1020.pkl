VRestaurants and the food industry in general
p4
aVare pretty much the most wasteful industry
p5
aVin the world.
p6
aVFor every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today,
p7
aV10 calories are taken to produce it.
p8
aVThat's a lot.
p9
aVI want to take something rather humble
p10
aVto discuss.
p11
aVI found this in the farmers' market today,
p12
aVand if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later, you're very welcome to.
p13
aVThe humble potato \u2014
p14
aVand I've spent a long time, 25 years, preparing these.
p15
aVAnd it pretty much goes through
p16
aVeight different forms in its lifetime.
p17
aVFirst of all, it's planted, and that takes energy.
p18
aVIt grows and is nurtured.
p19
aVIt's then harvested.
p20
aVIt's then distributed,
p21
aVand distribution is a massive issue.
p22
aVIt's then sold and bought,
p23
aVand it's then delivered to me.
p24
aVI basically take it, prepare it,
p25
aVand then people consume it \u2014 hopefully they enjoy it.
p26
aVThe last stage is basically waste,
p27
aVand this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it.
p28
aVThere are different types of waste.
p29
aVThere's a waste of time; there's a waste of space; there's a waste of energy;
p30
aVand there's a waste of waste.
p31
aVAnd every business I've been working on
p32
aVover the past five years,
p33
aVI'm trying to lower each one of these elements.
p34
aa(lp35
VOkay, so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like.
p36
aVBasically a restaurant just like any other.
p37
aVThis is the restaurant, Acorn House.
p38
aVFront and back.
p39
aVSo let me run you through a few ideas.
p40
aVFloor: sustainable, recyclable.
p41
aVChairs: recycled and recyclable.
p42
aVTables: Forestry Commission.
p43
aVThis is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood.
p44
aVThis bench, although it was uncomfortable for my mom \u2014
p45
aVshe didn't like sitting on it,
p46
aVso she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale \u2014
p47
aVreusing, a job that was pretty good.
p48
aVI hate waste, especially walls.
p49
aVIf they're not working, put a shelf on it, which I did,
p50
aVand that shows all the customers my products.
p51
aVThe whole business is run on sustainable energy.
p52
aVThis is powered by wind. All of the lights are daylight bulbs.
p53
aVPaint is all low-volume chemical,
p54
aVwhich is very important when you're working in the room all the time.
p55
aVI was experimenting with these \u2014 I don't know if you can see it \u2014
p56
aVbut there's a work surface there.
p57
aVAnd that's a plastic polymer.
p58
aVAnd I was thinking, well I'm trying to think nature, nature, nature.
p59
aVBut I thought, no, no, experiment with resins,
p60
aVexperiment with polymers.
p61
aVWill they outlive me? They probably might.
p62
aVRight, here's a reconditioned coffee machine.
p63
aVIt actually looks better than a brand new one \u2014 so looking good there.
p64
aVNow reusing is vital.
p65
aVAnd we filter our own water.
p66
aVWe put them in bottles, refrigerate them,
p67
aVand then we reuse that bottle again and again and again.
p68
aVHere's a great little example.
p69
aVIf you can see this orange tree, it's actually growing in a car tire,
p70
aVwhich has been turned inside out and sewn up.
p71
aVIt's got my compost in it, which is growing an orange tree, which is great.
p72
aa(lp73
VThis is the kitchen, which is in the same room.
p74
aVI basically created a menu that allowed people
p75
aVto choose the amount and volume of food
p76
aVthat they wanted to consume.
p77
aVRather than me putting a dish down,
p78
aVthey were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted.
p79
aVOkay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters.
p80
aVIt serves 220 people a day.
p81
aVWe generate quite a lot of waste.
p82
aVThis is the waste room.
p83
aVYou can't get rid of waste.
p84
aVBut this story's not about eliminating it, it's about minimizing it.
p85
aVIn here, I have produce and boxes
p86
aVthat are unavoidable.
p87
aVI put my food waste into this dehydrating, desiccating macerator \u2014
p88
aVturns food into an inner material,
p89
aVwhich I can store and then compost later.
p90
aa(lp91
VI compost it in this garden.
p92
aVAll of the soil you can see there is basically my food,
p93
aVwhich is generated by the restaurant,
p94
aVand it's growing in these tubs, which I made out of storm-felled trees
p95
aVand wine casks and all kinds of things.
p96
aVThree compost bins \u2014
p97
aVgo through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week \u2014
p98
aVreally good, makes fantastic compost.
p99
aVA couple of wormeries in there too.
p100
aVAnd actually one of the wormeries
p101
aVwas a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it.
p102
aVAnd I tried taking the dried food waste,
p103
aVputting it to the worms, going, "There you go, dinner."
p104
aVIt was like vegetable jerky,
p105
aVand killed all of them.
p106
aVI don't know how many worms [were] in there,
p107
aVbut I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you.
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aVWhat you're seeing here is a water filtration system.
p110
aVThis takes the water out of the restaurant,
p111
aVruns it through these stone beds \u2014 this is going to be mint in there \u2014
p112
aVand I sort of water the garden with it.
p113
aVAnd I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos,
p114
aVmaybe wash hands with it, I don't know.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo, water is a very important aspect.
p117
aVI started meditating on that
p118
aVand created a restaurant called Waterhouse.
p119
aVIf I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant
p120
aVthat is consuming no gas to start with, that would be great.
p121
aVI managed to do it.
p122
aVThis restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House \u2014
p123
aVsame chairs, same tables.
p124
aVThey're all English and a little bit more sustainable.
p125
aVBut this is an electrical restaurant.
p126
aVThe whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen.
p127
aVAnd it's run on hydroelectricity,
p128
aVso I've gone from air to water.
p129
aVNow it's important to understand
p130
aVthat this room
p131
aVis cooled by water, heated by water,
p132
aVfilters its own water,
p133
aVand it's powered by water.
p134
aVIt literally is Waterhouse.
p135
aVThe air handling system inside it \u2014
p136
aVI got rid of air-conditioning
p137
aVbecause I thought there was too much consumption going on there.
p138
aVThis is basically air-handling.
p139
aVI'm taking the temperature of the canal outside,
p140
aVpumping it through the heat exchange mechanism,
p141
aVit's turning through these amazing sails on the roof,
p142
aVand that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant,
p143
aVcooling them, or heating them, as the need may be.
p144
aVAnd this is an English willow air diffuser,
p145
aVand that's softly moving
p146
aVthat air current through the room.
p147
aVVery advanced, no air-conditioning \u2014 I love it.
p148
aVIn the canal, which is just outside the restaurant,
p149
aVthere is hundreds of meters of coil piping.
p150
aVThis takes the temperature of the canal
p151
aVand turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange.
p152
aVI have no idea how it works, but I paid a lot of money for it.
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aVAnd what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant
p155
aVlives on this boat \u2014 it's off-grid; it generates all its own power.
p156
aVHe's growing all his own fruit, and that's fantastic.
p157
aa(lp158
VThere's no accident in names of these restaurants.
p159
aVAcorn House is the element of wood; Waterhouse is the element of water;
p160
aVand I'm thinking, well, I'm going to be making
p161
aVfive restaurants based
p162
aVon the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities.
p163
aVI've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire.
p164
aVI've got metal and earth to come.
p165
aVSo you've got to watch your space for that.
p166
aVOkay. So this is my next project.
p167
aVFive weeks old,
p168
aVit's my baby, and it's hurting real bad.
p169
aVThe People's Supermarket.
p170
aVSo basically, the restaurants only really hit
p171
aVpeople who believed in what I was doing anyway.
p172
aVWhat I needed to do was get food out
p173
aVto a broader spectrum of people.
p174
aVSo people \u2014 i.e., perhaps, more working-class \u2014
p175
aVor perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative.
p176
aVThis is a social enterprise,
p177
aVnot-for-profit cooperative supermarket.
p178
aVIt really is about the social disconnect
p179
aVbetween food, communities
p180
aVin urban settings
p181
aVand their relationship to rural growers \u2014
p182
aVconnecting communities in London to rural growers.
p183
aVReally important.
p184
aVSo I'm committing to potatoes; I'm committing to milk;
p185
aVI'm committing to leeks and broccoli \u2014 all very important stuff.
p186
aVI've kept the tiles; I've kept the floors;
p187
aVI've kept the trunking; I've got in some recycled fridges;
p188
aVI've got some recycled tills; I've got some recycled trolleys.
p189
aVI mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable.
p190
aVIn fact, I'm trying and I'm going to make this
p191
aVthe most sustainable supermarket in the world.
p192
aVThat's zero food waste.
p193
aVAnd no one's doing that just yet.
p194
aVIn fact, Sainsbury's, if you're watching,
p195
aVlet's have a go. Try it on.
p196
aVI'm going to get there before you.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo nature doesn't create waste
p199
aVdoesn't create waste as such.
p200
aVEverything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle
p201
aVwith waste being the end of the beginning,
p202
aVand that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time,
p203
aVand it's an important statement to understand.
p204
aVIf we don't stand up
p205
aVand make a difference
p206
aVand think about sustainable food,
p207
aVthink about the sustainable nature of it,
p208
aVthen we may fail.
p209
aVBut, I wanted to get up and show you
p210
aVthat we can do it if we're more responsible.
p211
aVEnvironmentally conscious businesses are doable.
p212
aVThey're here. You can see I've done three so far;
p213
aVI've got a few more to go.
p214
aVThe idea is embryonic.
p215
aVI think it's important.
p216
aVI think that if we reduce, reuse, refuse
p217
aVand recycle \u2014 right at the end there \u2014
p218
aVrecycling is the last point I want to make;
p219
aVbut it's the four R's, rather than the three R's \u2014
p220
aVthen I think we're going to be on our way.
p221
aVSo these three are not perfect \u2014 they're ideas.
p222
aVI think that there are many problems to come,
p223
aVbut with help, I'm sure I'm going to find solutions.
p224
aVAnd I hope you all take part.
p225
aa(lp226
VThank you very much. (Applause)
