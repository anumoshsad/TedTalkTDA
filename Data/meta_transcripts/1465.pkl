VIs E.T. out there?
p4
aVWell, I work at the SETI Institute.
p5
aVThat's almost my name. SETI:
p6
aVSearch for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
p7
aVIn other words, I look for aliens,
p8
aVand when I tell people that at a cocktail party, they usually
p9
aVlook at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face.
p10
aVI try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate.
p11
aa(lp12
VNow, a lot of people think that this is kind of idealistic,
p13
aVridiculous, maybe even hopeless,
p14
aVbut I just want to talk to you a little bit about why I think
p15
aVthat the job I have is actually a privilege, okay,
p16
aVand give you a little bit of the motivation for my getting into
p17
aVthis line of work, if that's what you call it.
p18
aVThis thing \u2014 whoops, can we go back?
p19
aVHello, come in, Earth.
p20
aVThere we go. All right.
p21
aa(lp22
VThis is the Owens Valley Radio Observatory
p23
aVbehind the Sierra Nevadas, and in 1968,
p24
aVI was working there collecting data for my thesis.
p25
aVNow, it's kinda lonely, it's kinda tedious, just collecting data,
p26
aVso I would amuse myself by taking photos at night
p27
aVof the telescopes or even of myself,
p28
aVbecause, you know, at night, I would be the only hominid
p29
aVwithin about 30 miles.
p30
aVSo here are pictures of myself.
p31
aVThe observatory had just acquired a new book,
p32
aVwritten by a Russian cosmologist
p33
aVby the name of Joseph Shklovsky, and then expanded
p34
aVand translated and edited by a little-known
p35
aVCornell astronomer by the name of Carl Sagan.
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd I remember reading that book,
p38
aVand at 3 in the morning I was reading this book
p39
aVand it was explaining how the antennas I was using
p40
aVto measure the spins of galaxies could also be used
p41
aVto communicate, to send bits of information
p42
aVfrom one star system to another.
p43
aVNow, at 3 o'clock in the morning when you're all alone,
p44
aVhaven't had much sleep, that was a very romantic idea,
p45
aVbut it was that idea \u2014 the fact that you could in fact
p46
aVprove that there's somebody out there
p47
aVjust using this same technology \u2014
p48
aVthat appealed to me so much that 20 years later I took a job
p49
aVat the SETI Institute. Now, I have to say
p50
aVthat my memory is notoriously porous, and I've often
p51
aVwondered whether there was any truth in this story,
p52
aVor I was just, you know, misremembering something,
p53
aVbut I recently just blew up this old negative of mine,
p54
aVand sure enough, there you can see
p55
aVthe Shklovsky and Sagan book underneath that
p56
aVanalog calculating device.
p57
aVSo it was true.
p58
aa(lp59
VAll right. Now, the idea for doing this, it wasn't very old
p60
aVat the time that I made that photo.
p61
aVThe idea dates from 1960, when a young astronomer
p62
aVby the name of Frank Drake used this antenna
p63
aVin West Virginia, pointed it at a couple of nearby stars
p64
aVin the hopes of eavesdropping on E.T.
p65
aVNow, Frank didn't hear anything.
p66
aVActually he did, but it turned out to be the U.S. Air Force,
p67
aVwhich doesn't count as extraterrestrial intelligence.
p68
aVBut Drake's idea here became very popular
p69
aVbecause it was very appealing \u2014 and I'll get back to that \u2014
p70
aVand on the basis of this experiment, which didn't succeed,
p71
aVwe have been doing SETI ever since,
p72
aVnot continuously, but ever since.
p73
aa(lp74
VWe still haven't heard anything.
p75
aVWe still haven't heard anything.
p76
aVIn fact, we don't know about any life beyond Earth,
p77
aVbut I'm going to suggest to you that that's going to change
p78
aVrather soon, and part of the reason, in fact,
p79
aVthe majority of the reason why I think that's going to change
p80
aVis that the equipment's getting better.
p81
aVThis is the Allen Telescope Array, about 350 miles
p82
aVfrom whatever seat you're in right now.
p83
aVThis is something that we're using today
p84
aVto search for E.T., and the electronics have gotten
p85
aVvery much better too.
p86
aVThis is Frank Drake's electronics in 1960.
p87
aVThis is the Allen Telescope Array electronics today.
p88
aVSome pundit with too much time on his hands
p89
aVhas reckoned that the new experiments are approximately
p90
aV100 trillion times better than they were in 1960,
p91
aV100 trillion times better.
p92
aVThat's a degree of an improvement that would look good
p93
aVon your report card, okay?
p94
aVBut something that's not appreciated by the public is,
p95
aVin fact, that the experiment continues to get better,
p96
aVand, consequently, tends to get faster.
p97
aVThis is a little plot, and every time you show a plot,
p98
aVyou lose 10 percent of the audience.
p99
aVI have 12 of these. (Laughter)
p100
aVBut what I plotted here is just some metric
p101
aVthat shows how fast we're searching.
p102
aVIn other words, we're looking for a needle in a haystack.
p103
aVWe know how big the haystack is. It's the galaxy.
p104
aVBut we're going through the haystack no longer
p105
aVwith a teaspoon but with a skip loader,
p106
aVbecause of this increase in speed.
p107
aVIn fact, those of you who are still conscious
p108
aVand mathematically competent,
p109
aVwill note that this is a semi-log plot.
p110
aVIn other words, the rate of increase is exponential.
p111
aVIt's exponentially improving. Now, exponential is an
p112
aVoverworked word. You hear it on the media all the time.
p113
aVThey don't really know what exponential means,
p114
aVbut this is exponential.
p115
aVIn fact, it's doubling every 18 months, and, of course,
p116
aVevery card-carrying member of the digerati knows
p117
aVthat that's Moore's Law.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo this means that over the course of the next
p120
aVtwo dozen years, we'll be able to look at a million star systems,
p121
aVa million star systems, looking for signals
p122
aVthat would prove somebody's out there.
p123
aVWell, a million star systems, is that interesting?
p124
aVI mean, how many of those star systems have planets?
p125
aVAnd the facts are, we didn't know the answer to that
p126
aVeven as recently as 15 years ago, and in fact, we really
p127
aVdidn't know it even as recently as six months ago.
p128
aVBut now we do. Recent results suggest
p129
aVthat virtually every star has planets, and more than one.
p130
aVThey're like, you know, kittens. You get a litter.
p131
aVYou don't get one kitten. You get a bunch.
p132
aVSo in fact, this is a pretty accurate estimate
p133
aVof the number of planets in our galaxy,
p134
aVjust in our galaxy, by the way,
p135
aVand I remind the non-astronomy majors among you
p136
aVthat our galaxy is only one of 100 billion
p137
aVthat we can see with our telescopes.
p138
aa(lp139
VThat's a lot of real estate, but of course,
p140
aVmost of these planets are going to be kind of worthless,
p141
aVlike, you know, Mercury, or Neptune.
p142
aVNeptune's probably not very big in your life.
p143
aVSo the question is, what fraction of these planets
p144
aVare actually suitable for life?
p145
aVWe don't know the answer to that either,
p146
aVbut we will learn that answer this year, thanks to
p147
aVNASA's Kepler Space Telescope,
p148
aVand in fact, the smart money, which is to say the people who work on this project,
p149
aVthe smart money is suggesting that the fraction of planets
p150
aVthat might be suitable for life is maybe one in a thousand,
p151
aVone in a hundred, something like that.
p152
aVWell, even taking the pessimistic estimate, that it's
p153
aVone in a thousand, that means that there are
p154
aVat least a billion cousins of the Earth
p155
aVjust in our own galaxy.
p156
aVOkay, now I've given you a lot of numbers here,
p157
aVbut they're mostly big numbers, okay, so, you know,
p158
aVkeep that in mind. There's plenty of real estate,
p159
aVplenty of real estate in the universe,
p160
aVand if we're the only bit of real estate in which there's
p161
aVsome interesting occupants, that makes you a miracle,
p162
aVand I know you like to think you're a miracle,
p163
aVbut if you do science, you learn rather quickly that
p164
aVevery time you think you're a miracle, you're wrong,
p165
aVso probably not the case.
p166
aa(lp167
VAll right, so the bottom line is this:
p168
aVBecause of the increase in speed, and because of the
p169
aVvast amount of habitable real estate in the cosmos, I figure
p170
aVwe're going to pick up a signal within two dozen years.
p171
aVAnd I feel strongly enough about that to make a bet with you:
p172
aVEither we're going to find E.T. in the next two dozen years,
p173
aVor I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
p174
aVSo that's not so bad. I mean, even with two dozen years,
p175
aVyou open up your browser and there's news of a signal,
p176
aVor you get a cup of coffee.
p177
aVNow, let me tell you about some aspect of this that
p178
aVpeople don't think about, and that is,
p179
aVwhat happens? Suppose that what I say is true.
p180
aVI mean, who knows, but suppose it happens.
p181
aVSuppose some time in the next two dozen years
p182
aVwe pick up a faint line that tells us
p183
aVwe have some cosmic company.
p184
aVWhat is the effect? What's the consequence?
p185
aVNow, I might be at ground zero for this.
p186
aa(lp187
VI happen to know what the consequence for me would be,
p188
aVbecause we've had false alarms. This is 1997,
p189
aVand this is a photo I made at about 3 o'clock in the morning
p190
aVin Mountain View here, when we were watching
p191
aVthe computer monitors because we had picked up a signal
p192
aVthat we thought, "This is the real deal." All right?
p193
aVAnd I kept waiting for the Men in Black to show up. Right?
p194
aVI kept waiting for \u2014 I kept waiting for my mom to call,
p195
aVsomebody to call, the government to call. Nobody called.
p196
aVNobody called. I was so nervous
p197
aVthat I couldn't sit down. I just wandered around
p198
aVtaking photos like this one, just for something to do.
p199
aVWell, at 9:30 in the morning, with my head down
p200
aVon my desk because I obviously hadn't slept all night,
p201
aVthe phone rings and it's The New York Times.
p202
aVAnd I think there's a lesson in that, and that lesson is
p203
aVthat if we pick up a signal, the media, the media will be on it
p204
aVfaster than a weasel on ball bearings. It's going to be fast.
p205
aVYou can be sure of that. No secrecy.
p206
aVThat's what happens to me. It kind of ruins my whole week,
p207
aVbecause whatever I've got planned that week is kind of out the window.
p208
aa(lp209
VBut what about you? What's it going to do to you?
p210
aVAnd the answer is that we don't know the answer.
p211
aVWe don't know what that's going to do to you,
p212
aVnot in the long term, and not even very much in the short term.
p213
aVI mean, that would be a bit like
p214
aVasking Chris Columbus in 1491, "Hey Chris,
p215
aVyou know, what happens if it turns out that there's a
p216
aVcontinent between here and Japan, where you're sailing to,
p217
aVwhat will be the consequences for humanity
p218
aVif that turns out to be the case?"
p219
aVAnd I think Chris would probably offer you some answer
p220
aVthat you might not have understood, but it probably
p221
aVwouldn't have been right, and I think that to predict
p222
aVwhat finding E.T.'s going to mean,
p223
aVwe can't predict that either.
p224
aVBut here are a couple things I can say.
p225
aVTo begin with, it's going to be a society that's way in advance of our own.
p226
aVYou're not going to hear from alien Neanderthals.
p227
aVThey're not building transmitters.
p228
aVThey're going to be ahead of us, maybe by a few thousand
p229
aVyears, maybe by a few millions years, but substantially
p230
aVahead of us, and that means, if you can understand
p231
aVanything that they're going to say, then you might be able
p232
aVto short-circuit history by getting information from a society
p233
aVthat's way beyond our own.
p234
aVNow, you might find that a bit hyperbolic, and maybe it is,
p235
aVbut nonetheless, it's conceivable that this will happen,
p236
aVand, you know, you could consider this like, I don't know,
p237
aVgiving Julius Caesar English lessons and the key
p238
aVto the library of Congress.
p239
aVIt would change his day, all right?
p240
aa(lp241
VThat's one thing. Another thing that's for sure
p242
aVgoing to happen is that it will calibrate us.
p243
aVWe will know that we're not that miracle, right,
p244
aVthat we're just another duck in a row,
p245
aVwe're not the only kids on the block, and I think that that's
p246
aVphilosophically a very profound thing to learn.
p247
aVWe're not a miracle, okay?
p248
aa(lp249
VThe third thing that it might tell you is somewhat vague,
p250
aVbut I think interesting and important,
p251
aVand that is, if you find a signal coming from a more
p252
aVadvanced society, because they will be,
p253
aVthat will tell you something about our own possibilities,
p254
aVthat we're not inevitably doomed to self-destruction.
p255
aVBecause they survived their technology,
p256
aVwe could do it too.
p257
aVNormally when you look out into the universe,
p258
aVyou're looking back in time. All right?
p259
aVThat's interesting to cosmologists.
p260
aVBut in this sense, you actually can look into the future,
p261
aVhazily, but you can look into the future.
p262
aVSo those are all the sorts of things that would come from a detection.
p263
aa(lp264
VNow, let me talk a little bit about something that happens
p265
aVeven in the meantime, and that is,
p266
aVSETI, I think, is important, because it's exploration, and
p267
aVit's not only exploration, it's comprehensible exploration.
p268
aVNow, I gotta tell you, I'm always reading books about
p269
aVexplorers. I find exploration very interesting,
p270
aVArctic exploration, you know, people like Magellan,
p271
aVAmundsen, Shackleton, you see Franklin down there,
p272
aVScott, all these guys. It's really nifty, exploration.
p273
aVAnd they're just doing it because they want to explore,
p274
aVand you might say, "Oh, that's kind of a frivolous opportunity,"
p275
aVbut that's not frivolous. That's not a frivolous activity,
p276
aVbecause, I mean, think of ants.
p277
aVYou know, most ants are programmed to follow one another
p278
aValong in a long line, but there are a couple of ants,
p279
aVmaybe one percent of those ants, that are what they call
p280
aVpioneer ants, and they're the ones that wander off.
p281
aVThey're the ones you find on the kitchen countertop.
p282
aVYou gotta get them with your thumb before they
p283
aVfind the sugar or something.
p284
aVBut those ants, even though most of them get wiped out,
p285
aVthose ants are the ones that are essential to the survival
p286
aVof the hive. So exploration is important.
p287
aa(lp288
VI also think that exploration is important in terms of
p289
aVbeing able to address what I think is a critical
p290
aVlack in our society, and that is the lack of science literacy,
p291
aVthe lack of the ability to even understand science.
p292
aVNow, look, a lot has been written about the
p293
aVdeplorable state of science literacy in this country.
p294
aVYou've heard about it.
p295
aVWell, here's one example, in fact.
p296
aVPolls taken, this poll was taken 10 years ago.
p297
aVIt shows like roughly one third of the public thinks
p298
aVthat aliens are not only out there, we're looking for them
p299
aVout there, but they're here, right?
p300
aVSailing the skies in their saucers and occasionally
p301
aVabducting people for experiments their parents wouldn't approve of.
p302
aVWell, that would be interesting if it was true,
p303
aVand job security for me, but I don't think the evidence is
p304
aVvery good. That's more, you know, sad than significant.
p305
aa(lp306
VBut there are other things that people believe
p307
aVthat are significant, like the efficacy of homeopathy,
p308
aVor that evolution is just, you know, sort of a crazy idea
p309
aVby scientists without any legs, or, you know, evolution,
p310
aVall that sort of thing, or global warming.
p311
aVThese sorts of ideas don't really have any validity,
p312
aVthat you can't trust the scientists.
p313
aa(lp314
VNow, we've got to solve that problem, because that's
p315
aVa critically important problem, and you might say,
p316
aV"Well, okay, how are we gonna solve that problem with SETI?"
p317
aVWell, let me suggest to you that SETI obviously can't
p318
aVsolve the problem, but it can address the problem.
p319
aVIt can address the problem by getting young people
p320
aVinterested in science. Look, science is hard, it
p321
aVhas a reputation of being hard, and the facts are, it is hard,
p322
aVand that's the result of 400 years of science, right?
p323
aVI mean, in the 18th century, in the 18th century
p324
aVyou could become an expert on any field of science
p325
aVin an afternoon by going to a library,
p326
aVif you could find the library, right?
p327
aVIn the 19th century, if you had a basement lab,
p328
aVyou could make major scientific discoveries
p329
aVin your own home. Right? Because there was all this
p330
aVscience just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up.
p331
aVNow, that's not true anymore.
p332
aVToday, you've got to spend years in grad school
p333
aVand post-doc positions just to figure out what
p334
aVthe important questions are.
p335
aVIt's hard. There's no doubt about it.
p336
aa(lp337
VAnd in fact, here's an example: the Higgs boson,
p338
aVfinding the Higgs boson.
p339
aVAsk the next 10 people you see on the streets,
p340
aV"Hey, do you think it's worthwhile to spend billions
p341
aVof Swiss francs looking for the Higgs boson?"
p342
aVAnd I bet the answer you're going to get, is,
p343
aV"Well, I don't know what the Higgs boson is,
p344
aVand I don't know if it's important."
p345
aVAnd probably most of the people wouldn't even know
p346
aVthe value of a Swiss franc, okay?
p347
aVAnd yet we're spending billions of Swiss francs on this problem.
p348
aVOkay? So that doesn't get people interested in science
p349
aVbecause they can't comprehend what it's about.
p350
aVSETI, on the other hand, is really simple.
p351
aVWe're going to use these big antennas and we're going to
p352
aVtry to eavesdrop on signals. Everybody can understand that.
p353
aVYes, technologically, it's very sophisticated,
p354
aVbut everybody gets the idea.
p355
aa(lp356
VSo that's one thing. The other thing is, it's exciting science.
p357
aVIt's exciting because we're naturally interested
p358
aVin other intelligent beings, and I think that's
p359
aVpart of our hardwiring.
p360
aVI mean, we're hardwired to be interested
p361
aVin beings that might be, if you will, competitors,
p362
aVor if you're the romantic sort, possibly even mates. Okay?
p363
aVI mean, this is analogous to our interest in things that
p364
aVhave big teeth. Right?
p365
aVWe're interested in things that have big teeth, and you
p366
aVcan see the evolutionary value of that, and you can also see
p367
aVthe practical consequences by watching Animal Planet.
p368
aVYou notice they make very few programs about gerbils.
p369
aVIt's mostly about things that have big teeth.
p370
aVOkay, so we're interested in these sorts of things.
p371
aVAnd not just us. It's also kids.
p372
aVThis allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a
p373
aVhook to science, because SETI involves all kinds of science,
p374
aVobviously biology, obviously astronomy,
p375
aVbut also geology, also chemistry, various scientific
p376
aVdisciplines all can be presented in the guise of,
p377
aV"We're looking for E.T."
p378
aVSo to me this is interesting and important, and in fact,
p379
aVit's my policy, even though I give a lot of talks to adults,
p380
aVyou give talks to adults, and two days later they're back where they were.
p381
aVBut if you give talks to kids, you know,
p382
aVone in 50 of them, some light bulb goes off, and they think,
p383
aV"Gee, I'd never thought of that," and then they go,
p384
aVyou know, read a book or a magazine or whatever.
p385
aVThey get interested in something.
p386
aa(lp387
VNow it's my theory, supported only by anecdotal,
p388
aVpersonal anecdotal evidence, but nonetheless,
p389
aVthat kids get interested in something between the ages
p390
aVof eight and 11. You've got to get them there.
p391
aVSo, all right, I give talks to adults, that's fine, but I try
p392
aVand make 10 percent of the talks that I give,
p393
aVI try and make those for kids.
p394
aVI remember when a guy came to our high school, actually,
p395
aVit was actually my junior high school. I was in sixth grade.
p396
aVAnd he gave some talk. All I remember from it
p397
aVwas one word: electronics.
p398
aVIt was like Dustin Hoffman in "The Graduate," right,
p399
aVwhen he said "plastics," whatever that means, plastics.
p400
aVAll right, so the guy said electronics. I don't remember
p401
aVanything else. In fact, I don't remember anything
p402
aVthat my sixth grade teacher said all year,
p403
aVbut I remember electronics.
p404
aVAnd so I got interested in electronics, and you know,
p405
aVI studied to get my ham license. I was wiring up stuff.
p406
aVHere I am at about 15 or something, doing that sort of stuff.
p407
aVOkay? That had a big effect on me.
p408
aVSo that's my point, that you can have a big effect
p409
aVon these kids.
p410
aa(lp411
VIn fact, this reminds me, I don't know, a couple years ago
p412
aVI gave a talk at a school in Palo Alto
p413
aVwhere there were about a dozen 11-year-olds
p414
aVthat had come to this talk.
p415
aVI had been brought in to talk to these kids for an hour.
p416
aVEleven-year-olds, they're all sitting in a little semi-circle
p417
aVlooking up at me with big eyes, and I started,
p418
aVthere was a white board behind me, and I started off
p419
aVby writing a one with 22 zeroes after it, and I said,
p420
aV"All right, now look, this is the number of stars
p421
aVin the visible universe, and this number is so big
p422
aVthere's not even a name for it."
p423
aVAnd one of these kids shot up his hand, and he said,
p424
aV"Well, actually there is a name for it.
p425
aVIt's a sextra-quadra-hexa-something or other." Right?
p426
aVNow, that kid was wrong by four orders of magnitude,
p427
aVbut there was no doubt about it, these kids were smart.
p428
aVOkay? So I stopped giving the lecture.
p429
aVAll they wanted to do was ask questions.
p430
aVIn fact, my last comments to these kids, at the end I said,
p431
aV"You know, you kids are smarter
p432
aVthan the people I work with." Now \u2014 (Laughter)
p433
aVThey didn't even care about that.
p434
aVWhat they wanted was my email address
p435
aVso they could ask me more questions. (Laughter)
p436
aa(lp437
VLet me just say, look, my job is a privilege
p438
aVbecause we're in a special time.
p439
aVPrevious generations couldn't do this experiment at all.
p440
aVIn another generation down the line,
p441
aVI think we will have succeeded.
p442
aVSo to me, it is a privilege, and when I look in the mirror,
p443
aVthe facts are that I really don't see myself.
p444
aVWhat I see is the generation behind me.
p445
aVThese are some kids from the Huff School, fourth graders.
p446
aVI talked there, what, two weeks ago, something like that.
p447
aa(lp448
VI think that if you can instill some interest in science
p449
aVand how it works, well, that's a payoff
p450
aVbeyond easy measure. Thank you very much.
