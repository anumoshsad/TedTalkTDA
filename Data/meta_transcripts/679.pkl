VI'm going to talk about compassion and the golden rule
p4
aVfrom a secular perspective and even from a kind of scientific perspective.
p5
aVI'm going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history
p6
aVof compassion and the golden rule.
p7
aVSo, I'm going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language,
p8
aVand so it's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy
p9
aVas your average compassion talk.
p10
aVI want to warn you about that.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo, I do want to say, at the outset, that I think compassion's great.
p13
aVThe golden rule is great. I'm a big supporter of both.
p14
aVAnd I think it's great that
p15
aVthe leaders of the religions of the world
p16
aVare affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles
p17
aVthat are integral to their faiths.
p18
aa(lp19
VAt the same time, I think religions don't deserve all the credit.
p20
aVI think nature gave them a helping hand here.
p21
aVI'm going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule
p22
aVare, in a certain sense, built into human nature.
p23
aVBut I'm also going to argue
p24
aVthat once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature,
p25
aVyou realize that just affirming compassion,
p26
aVand affirming the golden rule, is really not enough.
p27
aVThere's a lot of work to be done after that.
p28
aa(lp29
VOK so, a quick natural history, first of compassion.
p30
aVIn the beginning, there was compassion,
p31
aVand I mean not just when human beings first showed up,
p32
aVbut actually even before that.
p33
aVI think it's probably the case that, in the human evolutionary lineage,
p34
aVeven before there were homo sapiens,
p35
aVfeelings like compassion and love and sympathy
p36
aVhad earned their way into the gene pool,
p37
aVand biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened.
p38
aa(lp39
VIt happened through a principle known as kin selection.
p40
aVAnd the basic idea of kin selection is that,
p41
aVif an animal feels compassion for a close relative,
p42
aVand this compassion leads the animal to help the relative,
p43
aVthen, in the end, the compassion actually winds up helping the genes
p44
aVunderlying the compassion itself.
p45
aVSo, from a biologist's point of view, compassion is actually
p46
aVa gene's way of helping itself. OK.
p47
aa(lp48
VI warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy.
p49
aVI'll get there \u2014 I hope to get a little fuzzier.
p50
aVThis doesn't bother me so much,
p51
aVthat the underlying Darwinian rationale of compassion
p52
aVis kind of self-serving at the genetic level.
p53
aVActually, I think the bad news about kin selection
p54
aVis just that it means that this kind of compassion
p55
aVis naturally deployed only within the family.
p56
aVThat's the bad news. The good news is compassion is natural.
p57
aVThe bad news is that this kin selected compassion
p58
aVis naturally confined to the family.
p59
aa(lp60
VNow, there's more good news that came along later in evolution,
p61
aVa second kind of evolutionary logic.
p62
aVBiologists call that "reciprocal altruism." OK.
p63
aVAnd there, the basic idea is that
p64
aVcompassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor.
p65
aVAgain, I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion
p66
aVas you may have heard in the past,
p67
aVbut from a biologist's point of view, this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion
p68
aVis ultimately self-serving too.
p69
aVIt's not that people think that, when they feel the compassion.
p70
aVIt's not consciously self-serving, but to a biologist, that's the logic.
p71
aVAnd so, you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies.
p72
aa(lp73
VI'm sure a lot of you, if a close friend has something really terrible happen to them,
p74
aVyou feel really bad.
p75
aVBut if you read in the newspaper
p76
aVthat something really horrible happened to somebody you've never heard of,
p77
aVyou can probably live with that.
p78
aVThat's just human nature.
p79
aVSo, it's another good news/bad news story.
p80
aVIt's good that compassion was extended beyond the family
p81
aVby this kind of evolutionary logic.
p82
aVThe bad news is this doesn't bring us universal compassion by itself.
p83
aVSo, there's still work to be done.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow, there's one other result of this dynamic called reciprocal altruism,
p86
aVwhich I think is kind of good news,
p87
aVwhich is that the way that this is played out in the human species,
p88
aVit has given people an intuitive appreciation of the golden rule.
p89
aVI don't quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes,
p90
aVbut you can go to a hunter gatherer society
p91
aVthat has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions,
p92
aVno exposure to ethical philosophy,
p93
aVand you'll find, if you spend time with these people,
p94
aVthat, basically, they believe that one good turn deserves another,
p95
aVand that bad deeds should be punished.
p96
aVAnd evolutionary psychologists think that these intuitions have a basis in the genes.
p97
aVSo, they do understand that if you want to be treated well,
p98
aVyou treat other people well.
p99
aVAnd it's good to treat other people well.
p100
aVThat's close to being a kind of built-in intuition.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo, that's good news. Now, if you've been paying attention,
p103
aVyou're probably anticipating that there's bad news here;
p104
aVwe still aren't to universal love,
p105
aVand it's true because, although an appreciation of the golden rule is natural,
p106
aVit's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule.
p107
aa(lp108
VI mean, for example, none of us, probably, want to go to prison,
p109
aVbut we all think that there are some people who should go to prison. Right?
p110
aVSo, we think we should treat them differently than we would want to be treated.
p111
aVNow, we have a rationale for that.
p112
aVWe say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison.
p113
aa(lp114
VNone of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion.
p115
aVWe have the capacity to carve out exceptions,
p116
aVput people in a special category.
p117
aVAnd the problem is that \u2014 although in the case of sending people to prison,
p118
aVyou have this impartial judiciary
p119
aVdetermining who gets excluded from the golden rule \u2014
p120
aVthat in everyday life, the way we all make these decisions
p121
aVabout who we're not going to extend the golden rule to,
p122
aVis we use a much rougher and readier formula.
p123
aVBasically it's just like, if you're my enemy, if you're my rival \u2014
p124
aVif you're not my friend, if you're not in my family \u2014
p125
aVI'm much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you.
p126
aa(lp127
VWe all do that,
p128
aVand you see it all over the world.
p129
aVYou see it in the Middle East:
p130
aVpeople who, from Gaza, are firing missiles at Israel.
p131
aVThey wouldn't want to have missiles fired at them, but they say,
p132
aV"Well, but the Israelis, or some of them have done things
p133
aVthat put them in a special category."
p134
aVThe Israelis would not want to have an economic blockade imposed on them,
p135
aVbut they impose one on Gaza, and they say,
p136
aV"Well, the Palestinians, or some of them, have brought this on themselves."
p137
aa(lp138
VSo, it's these exclusions to the golden rule that amount to a lot of the world's trouble.
p139
aVAnd it's natural to do that.
p140
aVSo, the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us
p141
aVis not, by itself, going to bring us universal love.
p142
aVIt's not going to save the world.
p143
aa(lp144
VNow, there's one piece of good news I have that may save the world. Okay.
p145
aVAre you on the edges of your seats here?
p146
aVGood, because before I tell you about that good news,
p147
aVI'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain.
p148
aVSo, I hope I've got your attention with this promise of good news
p149
aVthat may save the world.
p150
aa(lp151
VIt's this non-zero-sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about.
p152
aVIt's just a quick introduction to game theory.
p153
aVThis won't hurt. Okay.
p154
aVIt's about zero-sum and non-zero-sum games.
p155
aVIf you ask what kind of a situation
p156
aVis conducive to people becoming friends and allies,
p157
aVthe technical answer is a non-zero-sum situation.
p158
aVAnd if you ask what kind of situation
p159
aVis conducive to people defining people as enemies,
p160
aVit's a zero-sum situation.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo, what do those terms mean?
p163
aVBasically, a zero-sum game is the kind you're used to in sports,
p164
aVwhere there's a winner and a loser.
p165
aVSo, their fortunes add up to zero.
p166
aVSo, in tennis, every point is either good for you and bad for the other person,
p167
aVor good for them, bad for you.
p168
aVEither way, your fortunes add up to zero. That's a zero-sum game.
p169
aa(lp170
VNow, if you're playing doubles,
p171
aVthen the person on your side of the net
p172
aVis in a non-zero-sum relationship with you,
p173
aVbecause every point is either good for both of you \u2014 positive, win-win \u2014
p174
aVor bad for both of you, it's lose-lose.
p175
aVThat's a non-zero-sum game.
p176
aVAnd in real life, there are lots of non-zero-sum games.
p177
aVIn the realm of economics, say, if you buy something:
p178
aVthat means you'd rather have the merchandise than the money,
p179
aVbut the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise.
p180
aVYou both feel you've won.
p181
aVIn a war, two allies are playing a non-zero-sum game.
p182
aVIt's going to either be win-win or lose-lose for them.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo, there are lots of non-zero-sum games in real life.
p185
aVAnd you could basically reformulate what I said earlier,
p186
aVabout how compassion is deployed and the golden rule is deployed,
p187
aVby just saying, well, compassion most naturally flows along non-zero-sum channels
p188
aVwhere people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win-win situation
p189
aVwith some of their friends or allies.
p190
aVThe deployment of the golden rule
p191
aVmost naturally happens along these non-zero-sum channels.
p192
aVSo, kind of webs of non-zero-sumness
p193
aVare where you would expect compassion and the golden rule
p194
aVto kind of work their magic.
p195
aVWith zero-sum channels you would expect something else.
p196
aa(lp197
VOkay. So, now you're ready for the good news that I said might save the world.
p198
aVAnd now I can admit that it might not too,
p199
aVnow that I've held your attention for three minutes of technical stuff.
p200
aVBut it may. And the good news is that history
p201
aVhas naturally expanded these webs of non-zero-sumness,
p202
aVthese webs that can be these channels for compassion.
p203
aVYou can go back all the way to the stone age:
p204
aVtechnological evolution \u2014 roads, the wheel, writing,
p205
aVa lot of transportation and communication technologies \u2014
p206
aVhas just inexorably made it so that more people
p207
aVcan be in more non-zero-sum relationships
p208
aVwith more and more people at greater and greater distances.
p209
aVThat's the story of civilization.
p210
aVIt's why social organization has grown from the hunter-gatherer village
p211
aVto the ancient state, the empire, and now here we are in a globalized world.
p212
aVAnd the story of globalization is largely a story of non-zero-sumness.
p213
aa(lp214
VYou've probably heard the term "interdependence"
p215
aVapplied to the modern world. Well, that's just another term for non-zero-sum.
p216
aVIf your fortunes are interdependent with somebody,
p217
aVthen you live in a non-zero-sum relationship with them.
p218
aVAnd you see this all the time in the modern world.
p219
aVYou saw it with the recent economic crash,
p220
aVwhere bad things happen in the economy \u2014
p221
aVbad for everybody, for much of the world.
p222
aVGood things happen, and it's good for much of the world.
p223
aa(lp224
VAnd, you know, I'm happy to say, I think there's really evidence
p225
aVthat this non-zero-sum kind of connection
p226
aVcan expand the moral compass.
p227
aVI mean, if you look at the American attitudes
p228
aVtoward Japanese during World War II \u2014
p229
aVlook at the depictions of Japanese
p230
aVin the American media as just about subhuman,
p231
aVand look at the fact that we dropped atomic bombs,
p232
aVreally without giving it much of a thought \u2014
p233
aVand you compare that to the attitude now,
p234
aVI think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence.
p235
aa(lp236
VAny form of interdependence, or non-zero-sum relationship
p237
aVforces you to acknowledge the humanity of people.
p238
aVSo, I think that's good.
p239
aVAnd the world is full of non-zero-sum dynamics.
p240
aVEnvironmental problems, in many ways, put us all in the same boat.
p241
aVAnd there are non-zero-sum relationships that maybe people aren't aware of.
p242
aa(lp243
VFor example, probably a lot of American Christians
p244
aVdon't think of themselves as being in a non-zero-sum relationship
p245
aVwith Muslims halfway around the world,
p246
aVbut they really are, because if these Muslims become happier and happier
p247
aVwith their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it,
p248
aVthat's good for Americans, because there will be fewer terrorists
p249
aVto threaten American security.
p250
aVIf they get less and less happy, that will be bad for Americans.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo, there's plenty of non-zero-sumness.
p253
aVAnd so, the question is: If there's so much non-zero-sumness,
p254
aVwhy has the world not yet been suffused in love, peace, and understanding?
p255
aVThe answer's complicated. It's the occasion for a whole other talk.
p256
aVCertainly, a couple of things are that,
p257
aVfirst of all, there are a lot of zero-sum situations in the world.
p258
aVAnd also, sometimes people don't recognize
p259
aVthe non-zero-sum dynamics in the world.
p260
aVIn both of these areas,
p261
aVI think politicians can play a role.
p262
aa(lp263
VThis isn't only about religion.
p264
aVI think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships,
p265
aVEconomic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on,
p266
aVin this regard.
p267
aVAnd politicians can be aware, and should be aware that,
p268
aVwhen people around the world are looking at them,
p269
aVare looking at their nation
p270
aVand picking up their cues
p271
aVfor whether they are in a zero-sum or a non-zero-sum relationship with a nation \u2014
p272
aVlike, say, America, or any other nation \u2014
p273
aVhuman psychology is such that they use cues like:
p274
aVDo we feel we're being respected?
p275
aVBecause, you know, historically, if you're not being respected,
p276
aVyou're probably not going to wind up in a non-zero-sum,
p277
aVmutually profitable relationship with people.
p278
aVSo, we need to be aware of what kind of signals we're sending out.
p279
aVAnd some of this, again, is in the realm of political work.
p280
aa(lp281
VIf there's one thing I can encourage everyone to do,
p282
aVpoliticians, religious leaders, and us,
p283
aVit would be what I call "expanding the moral imagination" \u2014
p284
aVthat is to say, your ability to put yourself in the shoes
p285
aVof people in very different circumstances.
p286
aVThis is not the same as compassion,
p287
aVbut it's conducive to compassion. It opens the channels for compassion.
p288
aVAnd I'm afraid we have another good news/bad news story,
p289
aVwhich is that the moral imagination is part of human nature.
p290
aVThat's good, but again we tend to deploy it selectively.
p291
aa(lp292
VOnce we define somebody as an enemy,
p293
aVwe have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes, just naturally.
p294
aVSo, if you want to take a particularly hard case for an American:
p295
aVsomebody in Iran who is burning an American flag, and you see them on TV.
p296
aVWell, the average American is going to resist
p297
aVthe moral exercise of putting themselves in that person's head
p298
aVand is going to resist the idea that they have much in common with that person.
p299
aVAnd if you tell them, "Well, they think America disrespects them
p300
aVand even wants to dominate them, and they hate America.
p301
aVHas there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much
p302
aVthat you kind of hated them briefly"?
p303
aVYou know, they'll resist that comparison and that's natural, that's human.
p304
aa(lp305
VAnd, similarly, the person in Iran:
p306
aVwhen you try to humanize somebody in America who said that Islam is evil,
p307
aVthey'll have trouble with that.
p308
aVSo, it's a very difficult thing to get people to expand the moral imagination
p309
aVto a place it doesn't naturally go.
p310
aVI think it's worth the trouble because,
p311
aVagain, it just helps us to understand.
p312
aVIf you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags,
p313
aVit helps to understand what makes them do it.
p314
aVAnd I think it's good moral exercise.
p315
aa(lp316
VI would say here is where religious leaders come in,
p317
aVbecause religious leaders are good at reframing issues for people,
p318
aVat harnessing the emotional centers of the brain
p319
aVto get people to alter their awareness and reframe the way they think.
p320
aVI mean, religious leaders are kind of in the inspiration business.
p321
aVIt's their great calling right now,
p322
aVto get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations,
p323
aVappreciating that in so many ways they're in the same boat.
p324
aa(lp325
VI would just sum up the way things look, at least from this secular perspective,
p326
aVas far as compassion and the golden rule go,
p327
aVby saying that it's good news that compassion and the golden rule
p328
aVare in some sense built into human nature.
p329
aVIt's unfortunate that they tend to be selectively deployed.
p330
aVAnd it's going to take real work to change that.
p331
aVBut, nobody ever said that doing God's work was going to be easy. Thanks.
