VHave you ever been asked by your Chinese friend,
p4
aV"What is your zodiac sign?"
p5
aVDon't think they are making small talk.
p6
aVIf you say, "I'm a Monkey,"
p7
aVthey immediately know
p8
aVyou are either 24, 36, 48 or 60 years old.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aVAsking a zodiac sign is a polite way of asking your age.
p12
aa(lp13
VBy revealing your zodiac sign, you are also being evaluated.
p14
aVJudgments are being made about your fortune or misfortune,
p15
aVyour personality, career prospects
p16
aVand how you will do in a given year.
p17
aVIf you share you and your partner's animal signs,
p18
aVthey will paint a picture in their mind about your private life.
p19
aVMaybe you don't believe in the Chinese zodiac.
p20
aVAs a quarter of the world population is influenced by it,
p21
aVyou'd be wise to do something about that.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo what is the Chinese zodiac, exactly?
p24
aVMost Westerners think of Greco-Roman zodiac,
p25
aVthe signs divided into 12 months.
p26
aVThe Chinese zodiac is different.
p27
aVIt's a 12-year cycle labeled with animals,
p28
aVstarting with a Rat and ending with a Pig,
p29
aVand has no association with constellations.
p30
aVFor example, if you were born in 1975, you are a Rabbit.
p31
aVCan you see your zodiac sign there?
p32
aVOur Chinese ancestors constructed a very complicated theoretical framework
p33
aVbased on yin and yang, the five elements and the 12 zodiac animals.
p34
aVOver thousands of years,
p35
aVthis popular culture has affected people's major decisions,
p36
aVsuch as naming, marriage, giving birth and attitude towards each other.
p37
aVAnd some of the implications are quite amazing.
p38
aa(lp39
VThe Chinese believe certain animals get on better than the others.
p40
aVSo parents choose specific years to give birth to babies,
p41
aVbecause they believe the team effort by the right combination of animals
p42
aVcan give prosperity to families.
p43
aVWe even refer to the zodiac when entering into romantic relations.
p44
aVI'm a Pig; I should have perfect romance with Tigers, Goats and Rabbits.
p45
aVChinese people believe some animals are natural enemies.
p46
aVAs a Pig, I need to be careful with a Snake.
p47
aVRaise your hand if you are a Snake.
p48
aVLet's have a chat later.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VWe believe some animals are luckier than the others,
p53
aVsuch as the Dragon.
p54
aVUnlike the Western tradition,
p55
aVthe Chinese Dragon is a symbol for power, strength and wealth.
p56
aVIt's everyone's dream to have a Dragon baby.
p57
aVJack Ma's parents must have been very proud.
p58
aVAnd they are not the only ones.
p59
aVIn 2012, the Year of the Dragon,
p60
aVthe birthrate in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan
p61
aVincreased by five percent.
p62
aVThat means another one million more babies.
p63
aVWith a traditional preference to baby boys,
p64
aVthe boy-girl ratio that year was 120 to 100.
p65
aVWhen those Dragon boys grow up,
p66
aVthey will face much more severe competition in love and job markets.
p67
aa(lp68
VAccording to the BBC and the Chinese government's press release,
p69
aVJanuary 2015 saw a peak of Cesarean sections.
p70
aVWhy?
p71
aVThat was the last month for the Year of the Horse.
p72
aVIt's not because they like horses so much,
p73
aVit's because they try to avoid having unlucky Goat babies.
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VIf you are a Goat, please don't feel bad.
p78
aVThose are Goat babies.
p79
aVThey don't look like losers to me.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VTiger is another undesirable animal,
p84
aVdue to its volatile temperament.
p85
aVMany Chinese regions saw a sharp decline of birthrate
p86
aVduring those years.
p87
aVPerhaps one should consider zodiac in reverse,
p88
aVas those Tiger and Goat babies will face much less competition.
p89
aVMaybe they are the lucky ones.
p90
aVI went through the Forbes top 300 richest people in the world,
p91
aVand it's interesting to see
p92
aVthe most undesirable two animals, the Goat and Tiger,
p93
aVare at the top of the chart,
p94
aVeven higher than the Dragon.
p95
aVSo maybe we should consider,
p96
aVmaybe it's much better to have less competition.
p97
aa(lp98
VOne last but interesting point:
p99
aVmany Chinese people make their investment decisions
p100
aVbased on the zodiac sign index.
p101
aVAlthough the belief and tradition of the zodiac sign
p102
aVhas been over thousands of years,
p103
aVthe trend of using it in making major decisions
p104
aVdid not really happen until the past few decades.
p105
aVOur ancestors were very busy surviving poverty, drought,
p106
aVfamine, riot, disease and civil war.
p107
aVAnd finally, Chinese people have the time, wealth and technology
p108
aVto create an ideal life they've always wanted.
p109
aVThe collective decision made by 1.3 billion people
p110
aVhas caused the fluctuation in economics and demand on everything,
p111
aVfrom health care and education to property and consumer goods.
p112
aVAs China plays such an important role in the global economy and geopolitics,
p113
aVthe decisions made based on the zodiac and other Chinese traditions
p114
aVend up impacting everyone around the world.
p115
aa(lp116
VAre there any Monkeys here?
p117
aV2016 is the Year of the Monkey.
p118
aVMonkeys are clever, curious, creative and mischievous.
p119
aa(lp120
VThank you.
