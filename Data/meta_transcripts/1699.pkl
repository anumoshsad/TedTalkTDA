VThis is where I live. I live in Kenya,
p4
aVat the south parts of the Nairobi National Park.
p5
aVThose are my dad's cows at the back,
p6
aVand behind the cows,
p7
aVthat's the Nairobi National Park.
p8
aVNairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely,
p9
aVwhich means wild animals like zebras
p10
aVmigrate out of the park freely.
p11
aVSo predators like lions follow them,
p12
aVand this is what they do.
p13
aVThey kill our livestock.
p14
aVThis is one of the cows which was killed at night,
p15
aVand I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead,
p16
aVand I felt so bad,
p17
aVbecause it was the only bull we had.
p18
aa(lp19
VMy community, the Maasai, we believe that
p20
aVwe came from heaven with all our animals and all the land
p21
aVfor herding them, and that's why we value them so much.
p22
aVSo I grew up hating lions so much.
p23
aVThe morans are the warriors
p24
aVwho protect our community and the livestock,
p25
aVand they're also upset about this problem.
p26
aVSo they kill the lions.
p27
aVIt's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi.
p28
aVAnd I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo a boy, from six to nine years old, in my community
p31
aVis responsible for his dad's cows,
p32
aVand that's the same thing which happened to me.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo I had to find a way of solving this problem.
p35
aVAnd the first idea I got was to use fire,
p36
aVbecause I thought lions were scared of fire.
p37
aVBut I came to realize that that didn't really help,
p38
aVbecause it was even helping the lions
p39
aVto see through the cowshed.
p40
aVSo I didn't give up. I continued.
p41
aVAnd a second idea I got was
p42
aVto use a scarecrow.
p43
aVI was trying to trick the lions
p44
aV[into thinking] that I was standing near the cowshed.
p45
aVBut lions are very clever. (Laughter)
p46
aVThey will come the first day and they see the scarecrow, and they go back,
p47
aVbut the second day, they'll come and they say,
p48
aVthis thing is not moving here, it's always here. (Laughter)
p49
aVSo he jumps in and kills the animals.
p50
aVSo one night, I was walking around the cowshed with a torch,
p51
aVand that day, the lions didn't come.
p52
aVAnd I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light.
p53
aVSo I had an idea.
p54
aVSince I was a small boy,
p55
aVI used to work in my room for the whole day,
p56
aVand I even took apart my mom's new radio,
p57
aVand that day she almost killed me,
p58
aVbut I learned a lot about electronics. (Laughter)
p59
aVSo I got an old car battery,
p60
aVan indicator box. It's a small device found in a motorcycle,
p61
aVand it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left. It blinks.
p62
aVAnd I got a switch where I can switch on the lights, on and off.
p63
aVAnd that's a small torch from a broken flashlight.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo I set up everything.
p66
aVAs you can see, the solar panel charges the battery,
p67
aVand the battery supplies the power
p68
aVto the small indicator box. I call it a transformer.
p69
aVAnd the indicator box makes the lights flash.
p70
aVAs you can see, the bulbs face outside,
p71
aVbecause that's where the lions come from.
p72
aVAnd that's how it looks to lions when they come at night.
p73
aVThe lights flash and trick
p74
aVthe lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed,
p75
aVbut I was sleeping in my bed.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aV(Applause)
p79
aVThanks.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo I set it up in my home two years ago,
p82
aVand since then, we have never experienced any problem with lions.
p83
aVAnd my neighboring homes heard about this idea.
p84
aVOne of them was this grandmother.
p85
aVShe had a lot of her animals being killed by lions,
p86
aVand she asked me if I could put the lights for her.
p87
aVAnd I said, "Yes."
p88
aVSo I put the lights. You can see at the back, those are the lion lights.
p89
aVSince now, I've set up seven homes around my community,
p90
aVand they're really working.
p91
aVAnd my idea is also being used now all over Kenya
p92
aVfor scaring other predators like hyenas, leopards,
p93
aVand it's also being used
p94
aVto scare elephants away from people's farms.
p95
aa(lp96
VBecause of this invention, I was lucky to get a scholarship
p97
aVin one of the best schools in Kenya,
p98
aVBrookhouse International School,
p99
aVand I'm really excited about this.
p100
aVMy new school now is coming in and helping
p101
aVby fundraising and creating an awareness.
p102
aVI even took my friends back to my community,
p103
aVand we're installing the lights to the homes
p104
aVwhich don't have [any], and I'm teaching them how to put them.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo one year ago, I was just a boy in the savanna grassland
p107
aVherding my father's cows,
p108
aVand I used to see planes flying over,
p109
aVand I told myself that one day, I'll be there inside.
p110
aVAnd here I am today.
p111
aVI got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED.
p112
aVSo my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up.
p113
aa(lp114
VI used to hate lions, but now because my invention
p115
aVis saving my father's cows and the lions,
p116
aVwe are able to stay with the lions without any conflict.
p117
aVAshê olên. It means in my language, thank you very much.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Applause)

aa(lp121
VChris Anderson: You have no idea how exciting it is
p122
aVto hear a story like yours.
p123
aVSo you got this scholarship.Richard Turere: Yep.
p124
aa(lp125
VCA: You're working on other electrical inventions.
p126
aVWhat's the next one on your list?
p127
aa(lp128
VRT: My next invention is,
p129
aVI want to make an electric fence.CA: Electric fence?
p130
aVRT: But I know electric fences are already invented,
p131
aVbut I want to make mine.
p132
aV(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VCA: You already tried it once, right, and you \u2014RT: I tried it before,
p135
aVbut I stopped because it gave me a shock. (Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VCA: In the trenches. Richard Turere, you are something else.
p138
aVWe're going to cheer you on every step of the way, my friend.
p139
aVThank you so much.RT: Thank you. (Applause)
