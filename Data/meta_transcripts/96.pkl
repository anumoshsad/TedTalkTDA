(lp2
(lp3
VThank you. I have to tell you I'm both challenged and excited.
p4
aVMy excitement is: I get a chance to give something back.
p5
aVMy challenge is: the shortest seminar I usually do is 50 hours.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VI'm not exaggerating. I do weekends \u2014
p10
aVI do more, obviously, I also coach people \u2014
p11
aVbut I'm into immersion, because how did you learn language?
p12
aVNot just by learning principles,
p13
aVyou got in it and you did it so often that it became real.
p14
aa(lp15
VThe bottom line of why I'm here, besides being a crazy mofo, is that \u2014
p16
aVI'm not here to motivate you, you don't need that, obviously.
p17
aVOften that's what people think I do,
p18
aVand it's the furthest thing from it.
p19
aVWhat happens, though, is people say to me,
p20
aV"I don't need any motivation."
p21
aVBut that's not what I do.
p22
aVI'm the "why" guy.
p23
aVI want to know why you do what you do.
p24
aa(lp25
VWhat is your motive for action?
p26
aVWhat is it that drives you in your life today? Not 10 years ago.
p27
aVAre you running the same pattern?
p28
aVBecause I believe that the invisible force of internal drive, activated,
p29
aVis the most important thing.
p30
aVI'm here because I believe emotion is the force of life.
p31
aVAll of us here have great minds.
p32
aVMost of us here have great minds, right?
p33
aVWe all know how to think.
p34
aVWith our minds we can rationalize anything.
p35
aVWe can make anything happen.
p36
aa(lp37
VI agree with what was described a few days ago,
p38
aVthat people work in their self-interest.
p39
aVBut we know that that's bullshit at times.
p40
aVYou don't work in your self-interest all the time,
p41
aVbecause when emotion comes into it,
p42
aVthe wiring changes in the way it functions.
p43
aVSo it's wonderful to think intellectually about how the life of the world is,
p44
aVespecially those who are very smart can play this game in our head.
p45
aVBut I really want to know what's driving you.
p46
aa(lp47
VWhat I would like to invite you to do
p48
aVby the end of this talk is explore where you are today, for two reasons.
p49
aVOne: so that you can contribute more.
p50
aVAnd two: that hopefully we can not just understand other people more,
p51
aVbut appreciate them more, and create the kinds of connections
p52
aVthat can stop some of the challenges that we face today.
p53
aVThey're only going to get magnified by the very technology that connects us,
p54
aVbecause it's making us intersect.
p55
aVThat intersection doesn't always create a view
p56
aVof "everybody now understands everybody,
p57
aVand everybody appreciates everybody."
p58
aa(lp59
VI've had an obsession basically for 30 years,
p60
aV"What makes the difference in the quality of people's lives?
p61
aVWhat in their performance?"
p62
aVI got hired to produce the result now.
p63
aVI've done it for 30 years.
p64
aVI get the phone call
p65
aVwhen the athlete is burning down on national television,
p66
aVand they were ahead by five strokes
p67
aVand now they can't get back on the course.
p68
aVI've got to do something right now or nothing matters.
p69
aVI get the phone call when the child is going to commit suicide,
p70
aVI've got to do something.
p71
aVIn 29 years, I'm very grateful to tell you I've never lost one.
p72
aVIt doesn't mean I won't some day, but I haven't yet.
p73
aVThe reason is an understanding of these human needs.
p74
aa(lp75
VWhen I get those calls about performance, that's one thing.
p76
aVHow do you make a change?
p77
aVI'm also looking to see what is shaping the person's ability to contribute,
p78
aVto do something beyond themselves.
p79
aVMaybe the real question is,
p80
aVI look at life and say there's two master lessons.
p81
aVOne is: there's the science of achievement,
p82
aVwhich almost everyone here has mastered amazingly.
p83
aV"How do you take the invisible and make it visible,"
p84
aVHow do you make your dreams happen?
p85
aVYour business, your contribution to society, money \u2014
p86
aVwhatever, your body, your family.
p87
aa(lp88
VThe other lesson that is rarely mastered is the art of fulfillment.
p89
aVBecause science is easy, right?
p90
aVWe know the rules, you write the code and you get the results.
p91
aVOnce you know the game, you just up the ante, don't you?
p92
aVBut when it comes to fulfillment \u2014 that's an art.
p93
aVThe reason is, it's about appreciation and contribution.
p94
aVYou can only feel so much by yourself.
p95
aa(lp96
VI've had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the real question
p97
aVhow somebody's life changes
p98
aVif you look at them like those people that you've given everything to?
p99
aVLike all the resources they say they need.
p100
aVYou gave not a 100-dollar computer, but the best computer.
p101
aVYou gave them love, joy, were there to comfort them.
p102
aVThose people very often \u2014 you know some of them \u2014
p103
aVend up the rest of their life
p104
aVwith all this love, education, money and background
p105
aVgoing in and out of rehab.
p106
aVSome people have been through ultimate pain,
p107
aVpsychologically, sexually, spiritually, emotionally abused \u2014
p108
aVand not always, but often,
p109
aVthey become some of the people that contribute the most to society.
p110
aa(lp111
VThe question we've got to ask ourselves really is, what is it?
p112
aVWhat is it that shapes us?
p113
aVWe live in a therapy culture.
p114
aVMost of us don't do that, but the culture's a therapy culture,
p115
aVthe mindset that we are our past.
p116
aVAnd you wouldn't be in this room if you bought that,
p117
aVbut most of society thinks biography is destiny.
p118
aVThe past equals the future.
p119
aVOf course it does if you live there.
p120
aVBut what we know and what we have to remind ourselves \u2014
p121
aVbecause you can know something intellectually
p122
aVand then not use it, not apply it.
p123
aa(lp124
VWe've got to remind ourselves that decision is the ultimate power.
p125
aVWhen you ask people,
p126
aVhave you failed to achieve something significant in your life?
p127
aa(lp128
VSay, "Aye." Audience: Aye.
p129
aa(lp130
VTR: Thanks for the interaction on a high level there.
p131
aVBut if you ask people, why didn't you achieve something?
p132
aVSomebody who's working for you, or a partner, or even yourself.
p133
aVWhen you fail to achieve, what's the reason people say?
p134
aVWhat do they tell you?
p135
aVDidn't have the knowledge, didn't have the money,
p136
aVdidn't have the time, didn't have the technology.
p137
aVI didn't have the right manager.
p138
aa(lp139
VAl Gore: Supreme Court. TR: The Supreme Court.
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
V(Applause) (Cheering)
p144
aa(lp145
V(Applause continues)
p146
aa(lp147
VTR: And \u2014
p148
aa(lp149
V(Applause)
p150
aa(lp151
VWhat do all those, including the Supreme Court, have in common?
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VThey are a claim to you missing resources, and they may be accurate.
p156
aVYou may not have the money, or the Supreme Court,
p157
aVbut that is not the defining factor.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Applause) (Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd you correct me if I'm wrong.
p162
aVThe defining factor is never resources; it's resourcefulness.
p163
aVAnd what I mean specifically, rather than just some phrase,
p164
aVis if you have emotion, human emotion,
p165
aVsomething that I experienced from you the day before yesterday
p166
aVat a level that is as profound as I've ever experienced
p167
aVand I believe with that emotion you would have beat his ass and won.
p168
aa(lp169
VAudience: Yeah!
p170
aa(lp171
V(Applause) (Cheering)
p172
aa(lp173
VHow easy for me to tell him what he should do.
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VIdiot, Robbins.
p178
aVBut I know when we watched the debate at that time,
p179
aVthere were emotions that blocked people's ability
p180
aVto get this man's intellect and capacity.
p181
aVAnd the way that it came across to some people on that day \u2014
p182
aVbecause I know people that wanted to vote in your direction and didn't,
p183
aVand I was upset.
p184
aVBut there was emotion there.
p185
aVDo you know what I'm talking about?
p186
aa(lp187
VSay, "Aye." Audience: Aye.
p188
aa(lp189
VTR: So, emotion is it.
p190
aVAnd if we get the right emotion, we can get ourselves to do anything.
p191
aVIf you're creative, playful, fun enough,
p192
aVcan you get through to anybody, yes or no?
p193
aa(lp194
VIf you don't have the money,
p195
aVbut you're creative and determined, you find the way.
p196
aVThis is the ultimate resource.
p197
aVBut this is not the story that people tell us.
p198
aVThey tell us a bunch of different stories.
p199
aVThey tell us we don't have the resources, but ultimately,
p200
aVif you take a look here,
p201
aVthey say, what are all the reasons they haven't accomplished that?
p202
aVHe's broken my pattern, that son-of-a-bitch.
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VBut I appreciated the energy, I'll tell you that.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VWhat determines your resources?
p211
aVWe've said decisions shape destiny, which is my focus here.
p212
aVIf decisions shape destiny, what determines it is three decisions.
p213
aVWhat will you focus on?
p214
aVYou have to decide what you're going to focus on.
p215
aVConsciously or unconsciously.
p216
aVthe minute you decide to focus, you must give it a meaning,
p217
aVand that meaning produces emotion.
p218
aVIs this the end or the beginning?
p219
aVIs God punishing me or rewarding me, or is this the roll of the dice?
p220
aVAn emotion creates what we're going to do, or the action.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo, think about your own life,
p223
aVthe decisions that have shaped your destiny.
p224
aVAnd that sounds really heavy, but in the last five or 10 years,
p225
aVhave there been some decisions
p226
aVthat if you'd made a different decision, your life would be completely different?
p227
aVHow many can think about it? Better or worse. Say, "Aye."
p228
aa(lp229
VAudience: Aye.
p230
aa(lp231
VSo the bottom line is, maybe it was where to go to work,
p232
aVand you met the love of your life there, a career decision.
p233
aVI know the Google geniuses I saw here \u2014
p234
aVI mean, I understand that their decision was to sell their technology.
p235
aVWhat if they made that decision versus to build their own culture?
p236
aVHow would the world or their lives be different, their impact?
p237
aVThe history of our world is these decisions.
p238
aVWhen a woman stands up and says, "No, I won't go to the back of the bus."
p239
aVShe didn't just affect her life. That decision shaped our culture.
p240
aVOr someone standing in front of a tank.
p241
aVOr being in a position like Lance Armstrong,
p242
aV"You've got testicular cancer."
p243
aVThat's pretty tough for any male, especially if you ride a bike.
p244
aa(lp245
V(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
VYou've got it in your brain; you've got it in your lungs.
p248
aVBut what was his decision of what to focus on?
p249
aVDifferent than most people. What did it mean?
p250
aVIt wasn't the end; it was the beginning.
p251
aVHe goes off and wins seven championships he never once won
p252
aVbefore the cancer, because he got emotional fitness, psychological strength.
p253
aVThat's the difference in human beings that I've seen
p254
aVof the three million I've been around.
p255
aa(lp256
VIn my lab, I've had three million people from 80 countries over the last 29 years.
p257
aVAnd after a while, patterns become obvious.
p258
aVYou see that South America and Africa may be connected in a certain way, right?
p259
aVOthers say, "Oh, that sounds ridiculous." It's simple.
p260
aVSo, what shaped Lance? What shapes you?
p261
aVTwo invisible forces. Very quickly. One: state.
p262
aVWe all have had times,
p263
aVyou did something, and after, you thought to yourself,
p264
aV"I can't believe I said or did that, that was so stupid."
p265
aVWho's been there? Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye.
p266
aa(lp267
VOr after you did something, you go, "That was me!"
p268
aa(lp269
V(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
VIt wasn't your ability; it was your state.
p272
aVYour model of the world is what shapes you long term.
p273
aVYour model of the world is the filter. That's what's shaping us.
p274
aVIt makes people make decisions.
p275
aVTo influence somebody, we need to know what already influences them.
p276
aVIt's made up of three parts.
p277
aVFirst, what's your target? What are you after?
p278
aVIt's not your desires.
p279
aVYou can get your desires or goals.
p280
aVWho has ever got a goal or desire and thought, is this all there is?
p281
aa(lp282
VSay, "Aye." Audience: Aye.
p283
aa(lp284
VIt's needs we have. I believe there are six human needs.
p285
aVSecond, once you know what the target that's driving you is
p286
aVand you uncover it for the truth \u2014 you don't form it \u2014
p287
aVthen you find out what's your map,
p288
aVwhat's the belief systems that tell you how to get those needs.
p289
aVSome people think the way to get them is to destroy the world,
p290
aVsome people, to build, create something, love someone.
p291
aVThere's the fuel you pick. So very quickly, six needs.
p292
aa(lp293
VLet me tell you what they are. First one: certainty.
p294
aVThese are not goals or desires, these are universal.
p295
aVEveryone needs certainty they can avoid pain
p296
aVand at least be comfortable.
p297
aVNow, how do you get it?
p298
aVControl everybody? Develop a skill? Give up? Smoke a cigarette?
p299
aVAnd if you got totally certain, ironically,
p300
aVeven though we need that \u2014
p301
aVyou're not certain about your health, or your children, or money.
p302
aVIf you're not sure the ceiling will hold up,
p303
aVyou won't listen to any speaker.
p304
aVWhile we go for certainty differently, if we get total certainty, we get what?
p305
aVWhat do you feel if you're certain?
p306
aVYou know what will happen, when and how it will happen,
p307
aVwhat would you feel?
p308
aVBored out of your minds. So, God, in Her infinite wisdom,
p309
aVgave us a second human need, which is uncertainty.
p310
aVWe need variety. We need surprise.
p311
aVHow many of you here love surprises? Say, "Aye."
p312
aa(lp313
VAudience: Aye.
p314
aa(lp315
VTR: Bullshit. You like the surprises you want.
p316
aVThe ones you don't want, you call problems, but you need them.
p317
aVSo, variety is important.
p318
aVHave you ever rented a video or a film that you've already seen?
p319
aVWho's done this? Get a fucking life.
p320
aa(lp321
V(Laughter)
p322
aa(lp323
VWhy are you doing it?
p324
aVYou're certain it's good because you read or saw it before,
p325
aVbut you're hoping it's been long enough you've forgotten,
p326
aVand there's variety.
p327
aa(lp328
VThird human need, critical: significance.
p329
aVWe all need to feel important, special, unique.
p330
aVYou can get it by making more money or being more spiritual.
p331
aVYou can do it by getting yourself in a situation where you put
p332
aVmore tattoos and earrings in places humans don't want to know.
p333
aVWhatever it takes.
p334
aVThe fastest way to do this,
p335
aVif you have no background, no culture, no belief and resources
p336
aVor resourcefulness, is violence.
p337
aVIf I put a gun to your head and I live in the 'hood, instantly I'm significant.
p338
aVZero to 10. How high? 10.
p339
aVHow certain am I that you're going to respond to me? 10.
p340
aVHow much uncertainty?
p341
aVWho knows what's going to happen next? Kind of exciting.
p342
aVLike climbing up into a cave and doing that stuff
p343
aVall the way down there.
p344
aVTotal variety and uncertainty.
p345
aVAnd it's significant, isn't it? So you want to risk your life for it.
p346
aVSo that's why violence has always been around and will be around
p347
aVunless we have a consciousness change as a species.
p348
aVYou can get significance a million ways,
p349
aVbut to be significant, you've got to be unique and different.
p350
aa(lp351
VHere's what we really need: connection and love, fourth need.
p352
aVWe all want it;
p353
aVmost settle for connection, love's too scary.
p354
aVWho here has been hurt in an intimate relationship?
p355
aVIf you don't raise your hand, you've had other shit, too.
p356
aVAnd you're going to get hurt again.
p357
aVAren't you glad you came to this positive visit?
p358
aVHere's what's true: we need it.
p359
aVWe can do it through intimacy, friendship, prayer,
p360
aVthrough walking in nature.
p361
aVIf nothing else works for you, don't get a cat, get a dog,
p362
aVbecause if you leave for two minutes, it's like you've been gone six months,
p363
aVwhen you come back 5 minutes later.
p364
aa(lp365
VThese first four needs, every human finds a way to meet.
p366
aVEven if you lie to yourself, you need to have split personalities.
p367
aVI call the first four needs the needs of the personality.
p368
aVThe last two are the needs of the spirit.
p369
aVAnd this is where fulfillment comes.
p370
aVYou won't get it from the first four.
p371
aVYou'll figure a way, smoke, drink, do whatever, meet the first four.
p372
aVBut number five, you must grow.
p373
aVWe all know the answer.
p374
aVIf you don't grow, you're what?
p375
aVIf a relationship or business is not growing,
p376
aVif you're not growing,
p377
aVdoesn't matter how much money or friends you have,
p378
aVhow many love you,
p379
aVyou feel like hell.
p380
aVAnd I believe the reason we grow
p381
aVis so we have something to give of value.
p382
aa(lp383
VBecause the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves.
p384
aVBecause we all know, corny as that sounds,
p385
aVthe secret to living is giving.
p386
aVWe all know life is not about me, it's about we.
p387
aVThis culture knows that, this room knows that.
p388
aVIt's exciting.
p389
aVWhen you see Nicholas talking about his $100 computer,
p390
aVthe most exciting thing is:
p391
aVhere's a genius, but he's got a calling now.
p392
aVYou can feel the difference in him, and it's beautiful.
p393
aVAnd that calling can touch other people.
p394
aa(lp395
VMy life was touched because when I was 11 years old,
p396
aVThanksgiving, no money, no food,
p397
aVwe were not going to starve,
p398
aVbut my father was totally messed up,
p399
aVmy mom was letting him know how bad he messed up,
p400
aVand somebody came to the door and delivered food.
p401
aVMy father made three decisions, I know what they were, briefly.
p402
aVHis focus was "This is charity.
p403
aVWhat does it mean? I'm worthless.
p404
aVWhat do I have to do? Leave my family," which he did.
p405
aVIt was one of the most painful experiences of life.
p406
aVMy three decisions gave me a different path.
p407
aVI set focus on "There's food." What a concept!
p408
aa(lp409
V(Laughter)
p410
aa(lp411
VBut this is what changed my life, shaped me as a human being.
p412
aVSomebody's gift, I don't even know who it is.
p413
aVMy father always said, "No one gives a shit."
p414
aVAnd now somebody I don't know,
p415
aVthey're not asking for anything, just giving us food,
p416
aVlooking out for us.
p417
aVIt made me believe this: that strangers care.
p418
aVAnd that made me decide,
p419
aVif strangers care about me and my family, I care about them.
p420
aVI'm going to do something to make a difference.
p421
aVSo when I was 17, I went out on Thanksgiving,
p422
aVit was my target for years to have enough money to feed two families.
p423
aVThe most fun and moving thing I ever did in my life.
p424
aVNext year, I did four, then eight.
p425
aVI didn't tell anybody what I was doing, I wasn't doing it for brownie points.
p426
aVBut after eight, I thought I could use some help.
p427
aa(lp428
VSo I went out, got my friends involved,
p429
aVthen I grew companies, got 11, and I built the foundation.
p430
aV18 years later,
p431
aVI'm proud to tell you last year we fed 2 million people in 35 countries
p432
aVthrough our foundation.
p433
aVAll during the holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas,
p434
aVin different countries around the world.
p435
aa(lp436
V(Applause)
p437
aa(lp438
VThank you.
p439
aVI don't tell you that to brag, but because I'm proud of human beings
p440
aVbecause they get excited to contribute
p441
aVonce they've had the chance to experience it, not talk about it.
p442
aa(lp443
VSo, finally \u2014 I'm about out of time.
p444
aVThe target that shapes you \u2014
p445
aVHere's what's different about people.
p446
aVWe have the same needs.
p447
aVBut are you a certainty freak, is that what you value most,
p448
aVor uncertainty?
p449
aVThis man couldn't be a certainty freak if he climbed through those caves.
p450
aVAre you driven by significance or love?
p451
aVWe all need all six,
p452
aVbut what your lead system is tilts you in a different direction.
p453
aVAnd as you move in a direction, you have a destination or destiny.
p454
aVThe second piece is the map.
p455
aVThe operating system tells you how to get there,
p456
aVand some people's map is,
p457
aV"I'm going to save lives even if I die for other people,"
p458
aVand they're a fireman,
p459
aVand somebody else says, "I'm going to kill people to do it."
p460
aVThey're trying to meet the same needs of significance.
p461
aVThey want to honor God or honor their family.
p462
aVBut they have a different map.
p463
aa(lp464
VAnd there are seven different beliefs; I can't go through them, because I'm done.
p465
aVThe last piece is emotion.
p466
aVOne of the parts of the map is like time.
p467
aVSome people's idea of a long time is 100 years.
p468
aVSomebody else's is three seconds, which is what I have.
p469
aVAnd the last one I've already mentioned that fell to you.
p470
aVIf you've got a target and a map \u2014
p471
aVI can't use Google because I love Macs,
p472
aVand they haven't made it good for Macs yet.
p473
aVSo if you use MapQuest \u2014
p474
aVhow many have made this fatal mistake of using it?
p475
aVYou use this thing and you don't get there.
p476
aVImagine if your beliefs guarantee you can never get to where you want to go.
p477
aa(lp478
V(Laughter)
p479
aa(lp480
VThe last thing is emotion.
p481
aVHere's what I'll tell you about emotion.
p482
aVThere are 6,000 emotions
p483
aVthat we have words for in the English language,
p484
aVwhich is just a linguistic representation that changes by language.
p485
aVBut if your dominant emotions \u2014
p486
aVIf I have 20,000 people or 1,000
p487
aVand I have them write down all the emotions that they experience
p488
aVin an average week,
p489
aVand I give them as long as they need,
p490
aVand on one side they write empowering emotions,
p491
aVthe other's disempowering,
p492
aVguess how many emotions they experience? Less than 12.
p493
aVAnd half of those make them feel like shit.
p494
aVThey have six good feelings.
p495
aVHappy, happy, excited, oh shit,
p496
aVfrustrated, frustrated, overwhelmed, depressed.
p497
aVHow many of you know somebody
p498
aVwho, no matter what happens, finds a way to get pissed off?
p499
aa(lp500
V(Laughter)
p501
aa(lp502
VOr no matter what happens, they find a way to be happy or excited.
p503
aVHow many of you know somebody like this?
p504
aa(lp505
VWhen 9/11 happened, I'll finish with this, I was in Hawaii.
p506
aVI was with 2,000 people from 45 countries,
p507
aVwe were translating four languages simultaneously
p508
aVfor a program I was conducting, for a week.
p509
aVThe night before was called Emotional Mastery.
p510
aVI got up, had no plan for this, and I said \u2014
p511
aVwe had fireworks, I do crazy shit, fun stuff,
p512
aVand at the end, I stopped.
p513
aVI had this plan, but I never know what I'm going to say.
p514
aVAnd all of a sudden, I said,
p515
aV"When do people really start to live? When they face death."
p516
aVAnd I went through this whole thing
p517
aVabout, if you weren't going to get off this island,
p518
aVif nine days from now, you were going to die,
p519
aVwho would you call, what would you say, what would you do?
p520
aVThat night is when 9/11 happened.
p521
aa(lp522
VOne woman had come to the seminar, and when she came there,
p523
aVher previous boyfriend had been kidnapped and murdered.
p524
aVHer new boyfriend wanted to marry her, and she said no.
p525
aa(lp526
VHe said, "If you go to that Hawaii thing, it's over with us."
p527
aVShe said, "It's over."
p528
aVWhen I finished that night, she called him and left a message
p529
aVat the top of the World Trade Center where he worked, saying,
p530
aV"I love you, I want you to know I want to marry you.
p531
aVIt was stupid of me."
p532
aVShe was asleep, because it was 3 a.m. for us, when he called her back,
p533
aVand said, "Honey, I can't tell you what this means.
p534
aVI don't know how to tell you this, but you gave me the greatest gift,
p535
aVbecause I'm going to die."
p536
aVAnd she played the recording for us in the room.
p537
aVShe was on Larry King later.
p538
aVAnd he said, "You're probably wondering
p539
aVhow on Earth this could happen to you twice.
p540
aVAll I can say is this must be God's message to you.
p541
aVFrom now on, every day, give your all, love your all.
p542
aVDon't let anything ever stop you."
p543
aVShe finishes, and a man stands up, and he says,
p544
aV"I'm from Pakistan, I'm a Muslim.
p545
aVI'd love to hold your hand and say I'm sorry,
p546
aVbut frankly, this is retribution."
p547
aVI can't tell you the rest, because I'm out of time.
p548
aa(lp549
V(Laughter)
p550
aa(lp551
VAre you sure?
p552
aa(lp553
V(Laughter)
p554
aa(lp555
V10 seconds!
p556
aa(lp557
V(Laughter and applause)
p558
aa(lp559
V10 seconds, I want to be respectful.
p560
aVAll I can tell you is,
p561
aVI brought this man on stage
p562
aVwith a man from New York who worked in the World Trade Center,
p563
aVbecause I had about 200 New Yorkers there.
p564
aVMore than 50 lost their entire companies, friends,
p565
aVmarking off their Palm Pilots.
p566
aVOne financial trader, woman made of steel, bawling \u2014
p567
aV30 friends crossing off that all died.
p568
aVAnd I said, "What are we going to focus on?
p569
aVWhat does this mean and what are we going to do?"
p570
aa(lp571
VAnd I got the group to focus on:
p572
aVif you didn't lose somebody today,
p573
aVyour focus is going to be how to serve somebody else.
p574
aVThen one woman stood up and was so angry, screaming and yelling.
p575
aVI found out she wasn't from New York, she's not an American,
p576
aVdoesn't know anybody here.
p577
aVI asked, "Do you always get angry?"
p578
aVShe said, "Yes."
p579
aVGuilty people got guilty, sad people got sad.
p580
aVI took these two men and I did an indirect negotiation.
p581
aVJewish man with family in the occupied territory,
p582
aVsomeone in New York who would have died if he was at work that day,
p583
aVand this man who wanted to be a terrorist,
p584
aVand I made it very clear.
p585
aVThis integration is on a film, which I'd be happy to send you,
p586
aVinstead of my verbalization,
p587
aVbut the two of them not only came together
p588
aVand changed their beliefs and models of the world,
p589
aVbut worked together to bring, for almost four years now,
p590
aVthrough various mosques and synagogues,
p591
aVthe idea of how to create peace.
p592
aVAnd he wrote a book, called "My Jihad, My Way of Peace."
p593
aVSo, transformation can happen.
p594
aa(lp595
VMy invitation to you is:
p596
aVexplore your web,
p597
aVthe web in here \u2014
p598
aVthe needs, the beliefs, the emotions that are controlling you,
p599
aVfor two reasons:
p600
aVso there's more of you to give, and achieve, too,
p601
aVbut I mean give,
p602
aVbecause that's what's going to fill you up.
p603
aVAnd secondly, so you can appreciate \u2014
p604
aVnot just understand, that's intellectual, that's the mind,
p605
aVbut appreciate what's driving other people.
p606
aVIt's the only way our world's going to change.
p607
aa(lp608
VGod bless you, thank you. I hope this was of service.
