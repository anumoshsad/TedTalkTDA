VEverything is covered in invisible ecosystems
p4
aVmade of tiny lifeforms: bacteria, viruses and fungi.
p5
aVOur desks, our computers, our pencils, our buildings
p6
aVall harbor resident microbial landscapes.
p7
aVAs we design these things, we could be thinking
p8
aVabout designing these invisible worlds,
p9
aVand also thinking about how they interact
p10
aVwith our personal ecosystems.
p11
aa(lp12
VOur bodies are home to trillions of microbes,
p13
aVand these creatures define who we are.
p14
aVThe microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods.
p15
aVThe microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system.
p16
aVThe microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath,
p17
aVor not,
p18
aVand the key thing is that our personal ecosystems
p19
aVinteract with ecosystems on everything we touch.
p20
aVSo, for example, when you touch a pencil,
p21
aVmicrobial exchange happens.
p22
aa(lp23
VIf we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings,
p24
aVthis opens a path to influencing
p25
aVour health in unprecedented ways.
p26
aa(lp27
VI get asked all of the time from people,
p28
aV"Is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems?"
p29
aVAnd I believe the answer is yes.
p30
aVI think we're doing it right now,
p31
aVbut we're doing it unconsciously.
p32
aVI'm going to share data with you
p33
aVfrom one aspect of my research focused on architecture
p34
aVthat demonstrates how, through both conscious
p35
aVand unconscious design,
p36
aVwe're impacting these invisible worlds.
p37
aa(lp38
VThis is the Lillis Business Complex at the University of Oregon,
p39
aVand I worked with a team of architects and biologists
p40
aVto sample over 300 rooms in this building.
p41
aVWe wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building,
p42
aVand to do this, we sampled dust.
p43
aVFrom the dust, we pulled out bacterial cells,
p44
aVbroke them open, and compared their gene sequences.
p45
aVThis means that people in my group
p46
aVwere doing a lot of vacuuming during this project.
p47
aVThis is a picture of Tim, who,
p48
aVright when I snapped this picture, reminded me,
p49
aVhe said, "Jessica, the last lab group I worked in
p50
aVI was doing fieldwork in the Costa Rican rainforest,
p51
aVand things have changed dramatically for me."
p52
aa(lp53
VSo I'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices,
p54
aVand we're going to look at the data through a visualization tool
p55
aVthat I've been working on in partnership with Autodesk.
p56
aVThe way that you look at this data is,
p57
aVfirst, look around the outside of the circle.
p58
aVYou'll see broad bacterial groups,
p59
aVand if you look at the shape of this pink lobe,
p60
aVit tells you something about the relative abundance of each group.
p61
aVSo at 12 o'clock, you'll see that offices have a lot of
p62
aValphaproteobacteria, and at one o'clock
p63
aVyou'll see that bacilli are relatively rare.
p64
aa(lp65
VLet's take a look at what's going on in different space types in this building.
p66
aVIf you look inside the restrooms,
p67
aVthey all have really similar ecosystems,
p68
aVand if you were to look inside the classrooms,
p69
aVthose also have similar ecosystems.
p70
aVBut if you look across these space types,
p71
aVyou can see that they're fundamentally different
p72
aVfrom one another.
p73
aVI like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest.
p74
aVI told Tim, "If you could just see the microbes,
p75
aVit's kind of like being in Costa Rica. Kind of."
p76
aVAnd I also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland.
p77
aa(lp78
VThis perspective is a really powerful one for designers,
p79
aVbecause you can bring on principles of ecology,
p80
aVand a really important principle of ecology is dispersal,
p81
aVthe way organisms move around.
p82
aVWe know that microbes are dispersed around by people
p83
aVand by air.
p84
aVSo the very first thing we wanted to do in this building
p85
aVwas look at the air system.
p86
aVMechanical engineers design air handling units
p87
aVto make sure that people are comfortable,
p88
aVthat the air flow and temperature is just right.
p89
aVThey do this using principles of physics and chemistry,
p90
aVbut they could also be using biology.
p91
aVIf you look at the microbes
p92
aVin one of the air handling units in this building,
p93
aVyou'll see that they're all very similar to one another.
p94
aVAnd if you compare this to the microbes
p95
aVin a different air handling unit,
p96
aVyou'll see that they're fundamentally different.
p97
aVThe rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago,
p98
aVand what that means is that mechanical engineers
p99
aVare like eco-engineers, and they have the ability
p100
aVto structure biomes in this building the way that they want to.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnother facet of how microbes get around is by people,
p103
aVand designers often cluster rooms together
p104
aVto facilitate interactions among people,
p105
aVor the sharing of ideas, like in labs and in offices.
p106
aVGiven that microbes travel around with people,
p107
aVyou might expect to see rooms that are close together
p108
aVhave really similar biomes.
p109
aVAnd that is exactly what we found.
p110
aVIf you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another,
p111
aVthey have very similar ecosystems,
p112
aVbut if you go to an office
p113
aVthat is a farther walking distance away,
p114
aVthe ecosystem is fundamentally different.
p115
aVAnd when I see the power that dispersal has
p116
aVon these biogeographic patterns,
p117
aVit makes me think that it's possible
p118
aVto tackle really challenging problems,
p119
aVlike hospital-acquired infections.
p120
aVI believe this has got to be, in part,
p121
aVa building ecology problem.
p122
aa(lp123
VAll right, I'm going to tell you one more story about this building.
p124
aVI am collaborating with Charlie Brown.
p125
aVHe's an architect,
p126
aVand Charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change.
p127
aVHe's dedicated his life to sustainable design.
p128
aVWhen he met me and realized that it was possible for him
p129
aVto study in a quantitative way
p130
aVhow his design choices impacted
p131
aVthe ecology and biology of this building,
p132
aVhe got really excited, because it added a new dimension to what he did.
p133
aVHe went from thinking just about energy
p134
aVto also starting to think about human health.
p135
aVHe helped design some of the air handling systems
p136
aVin this building and the way it was ventilated.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo what I'm first going to show you is
p139
aVair that we sampled outside of the building.
p140
aVWhat you're looking at is a signature of bacterial communities
p141
aVin the outdoor air, and how they vary over time.
p142
aVNext I'm going to show you what happened
p143
aVwhen we experimentally manipulated classrooms.
p144
aVWe blocked them off at night
p145
aVso that they got no ventilation.
p146
aVA lot of buildings are operated this way,
p147
aVprobably where you work,
p148
aVand companies do this to save money on their energy bill.
p149
aVWhat we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant
p150
aVuntil Saturday, when we opened the vents up again.
p151
aVWhen you walked into those rooms,
p152
aVthey smelled really bad,
p153
aVand our data suggests that it had something to do with
p154
aVleaving behind the airborne bacterial soup
p155
aVfrom people the day before.
p156
aVContrast this to rooms
p157
aVthat were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy
p158
aVwhere air came in from the outside through louvers.
p159
aVIn these rooms, the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well,
p160
aVand when Charlie saw this, he got really excited.
p161
aVHe felt like he had made a good choice
p162
aVwith the design process
p163
aVbecause it was both energy efficient
p164
aVand it washed away the building's resident microbial landscape.
p165
aa(lp166
VThe examples that I just gave you are about architecture,
p167
aVbut they're relevant to the design of anything.
p168
aVImagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want
p169
aVin a plane
p170
aVor on a phone.
p171
aa(lp172
VThere's a new microbe, I just discovered it.
p173
aVIt's called BLIS, and it's been shown
p174
aVto both ward off pathogens
p175
aVand give you good breath.
p176
aVWouldn't it be awesome if we all had BLIS on our phones?
p177
aa(lp178
VA conscious approach to design,
p179
aVI'm calling it bioinformed design,
p180
aVand I think it's possible.
