VI live in South Central.
p4
aVThis is South Central:
p5
aVliquor stores,
p6
aVfast food,
p7
aVvacant lots.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo the city planners, they get together and they figure
p10
aVthey're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else,
p11
aVso they change it to South Los Angeles,
p12
aVlike this is going to fix what's really going wrong in the city.
p13
aVThis is South Los Angeles. (Laughter)
p14
aVLiquor stores,
p15
aVfast food,
p16
aVvacant lots.
p17
aa(lp18
VJust like 26.5 million other Americans,
p19
aVI live in a food desert,
p20
aVSouth Central Los Angeles,
p21
aVhome of the drive-thru and the drive-by.
p22
aVFunny thing is, the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys.
p23
aVPeople are dying from curable diseases
p24
aVin South Central Los Angeles.
p25
aVFor instance, the obesity rate in my neighborhood
p26
aVis five times higher than, say, Beverly Hills,
p27
aVwhich is probably eight, 10 miles away.
p28
aa(lp29
VI got tired of seeing this happening.
p30
aVAnd I was wondering, how would you feel
p31
aVif you had no access to healthy food,
p32
aVif every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects
p33
aVthat the present food system has on your neighborhood?
p34
aVI see wheelchairs bought and sold
p35
aVlike used cars.
p36
aVI see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks.
p37
aVAnd I figured, this has to stop.
p38
aVSo I figured that the problem is the solution.
p39
aVFood is the problem and food is the solution.
p40
aVPlus I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip
p41
aVto get an apple that wasn't impregnated with pesticides.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo what I did, I planted a food forest in front of my house.
p44
aVIt was on a strip of land that we call a parkway.
p45
aVIt's 150 feet by 10 feet.
p46
aVThing is, it's owned by the city.
p47
aVBut you have to maintain it.
p48
aVSo I'm like, "Cool. I can do whatever the hell I want,
p49
aVsince it's my responsibility and I gotta maintain it."
p50
aVAnd this is how I decided to maintain it.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo me and my group, L.A. Green Grounds, we got together
p53
aVand we started planting my food forest, fruit trees,
p54
aVyou know, the whole nine, vegetables.
p55
aVWhat we do, we're a pay-it-forward kind of group,
p56
aVwhere it's composed of gardeners from all walks of life,
p57
aVfrom all over the city, and it's completely volunteer,
p58
aVand everything we do is free.
p59
aVAnd the garden, it was beautiful.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd then somebody complained.
p62
aVThe city came down on me,
p63
aVand basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden,
p64
aVwhich this citation was turning into a warrant.
p65
aVAnd I'm like, "Come on, really?
p66
aVA warrant for planting food on a piece of land
p67
aVthat you could care less about?" (Laughter)
p68
aVAnd I was like, "Cool. Bring it."
p69
aVBecause this time it wasn't coming up.
p70
aVSo L.A. Times got ahold of it. Steve Lopez did a story on it
p71
aVand talked to the councilman,
p72
aVand one of the Green Grounds members,
p73
aVthey put up a petition on Change.org,
p74
aVand with 900 signatures, we were a success.
p75
aVWe had a victory on our hands.
p76
aVMy councilman even called in and said how they endorse
p77
aVand love what we're doing.
p78
aVI mean, come on, why wouldn't they?
p79
aVL.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns.
p80
aVThey own 26 square miles of vacant lots.
p81
aVThat's 20 Central Parks.
p82
aVThat's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants.
p83
aVWhy in the hell would they not okay this?
p84
aVGrowing one plant will give you 1,000, 10,000 seeds.
p85
aVWhen one dollar's worth of green beans
p86
aVwill give you 75 dollars' worth of produce.
p87
aVIt's my gospel, when I'm telling people, grow your own food.
p88
aVGrowing your own food is like printing your own money.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Applause)
p91
aa(lp92
VSee, I have a legacy in South Central.
p93
aVI grew up there. I raised my sons there.
p94
aVAnd I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality
p95
aVthat was manufactured for me by some other people,
p96
aVand I'm manufacturing my own reality.
p97
aa(lp98
VSee, I'm an artist.
p99
aVGardening is my graffiti. I grow my art.
p100
aVJust like a graffiti artist, where they beautify walls,
p101
aVme, I beautify lawns, parkways.
p102
aVI use the garden, the soil, like it's a piece of cloth,
p103
aVand the plants and the trees,
p104
aVthat's my embellishment for that cloth.
p105
aVYou'd be surprised what the soil could do
p106
aVif you let it be your canvas.
p107
aVYou just couldn't imagine how amazing a sunflower is
p108
aVand how it affects people.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo what happened?
p111
aVI have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education,
p112
aVa tool for the transformation of my neighborhood.
p113
aVTo change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
p114
aVWe are the soil.
p115
aVYou'd be surprised how kids are affected by this.
p116
aVGardening is the most therapeutic
p117
aVand defiant act you can do,
p118
aVespecially in the inner city.
p119
aVPlus you get strawberries.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VI remember this time,
p124
aVthere was this mother and a daughter came,
p125
aVit was, like, 10:30 at night, and they were in my yard,
p126
aVand I came out and they looked so ashamed.
p127
aVSo I'm like, man, it made me feel bad that they were there,
p128
aVand I told them, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
p129
aVThis is on the street for a reason.
p130
aVIt made me feel ashamed to see people
p131
aVthat were this close to me that were hungry,
p132
aVand this only reinforced why I do this,
p133
aVand people asked me, "Fin, aren't you afraid
p134
aVpeople are going to steal your food?"
p135
aVAnd I'm like, "Hell no, I ain't afraid they're gonna steal it.
p136
aVThat's why it's on the street.
p137
aVThat's the whole idea.
p138
aVI want them to take it, but at the same time,
p139
aVI want them to take back their health."
p140
aa(lp141
VThere's another time when I put
p142
aVa garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles.
p143
aVThese are the guys, they helped me unload the truck.
p144
aVIt was cool, and they just shared the stories
p145
aVabout how this affected them and how
p146
aVthey used to plant with their mother and their grandmother,
p147
aVand it was just cool to see how this changed them,
p148
aVif it was only for that one moment.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo Green Grounds has gone on to plant
p151
aVmaybe 20 gardens.
p152
aVWe've had, like, 50 people come to our dig-ins
p153
aVand participate, and it's all volunteers.
p154
aVIf kids grow kale, kids eat kale.
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aVIf they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes. (Applause)
p157
aVBut when none of this is presented to them,
p158
aVif they're not shown how food affects the mind and the body,
p159
aVthey blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them.
p160
aa(lp161
VI see young people
p162
aVand they want to work,
p163
aVbut they're in this thing where they're caught up \u2014
p164
aVI see kids of color and they're just on this track
p165
aVthat's designed for them,
p166
aVthat leads them to nowhere.
p167
aVSo with gardening, I see an opportunity
p168
aVwhere we can train these kids
p169
aVto take over their communities,
p170
aVto have a sustainable life.
p171
aVAnd when we do this, who knows?
p172
aVWe might produce the next George Washington Carver.
p173
aVbut if we don't change the composition of the soil,
p174
aVwe will never do this.
p175
aa(lp176
VNow this is one of my plans. This is what I want to do.
p177
aVI want to plant a whole block of gardens
p178
aVwhere people can share in the food in the same block.
p179
aVI want to take shipping containers
p180
aVand turn them into healthy cafes.
p181
aVNow don't get me wrong.
p182
aVI'm not talking about no free shit,
p183
aVbecause free is not sustainable.
p184
aVThe funny thing about sustainability,
p185
aVyou have to sustain it.
p186
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p187
aVWhat I'm talking about is putting people to work,
p188
aVand getting kids off the street, and letting them know
p189
aVthe joy, the pride and the honor in growing your own food,
p190
aVopening farmer's markets.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo what I want to do here,
p193
aVwe gotta make this sexy.
p194
aVSo I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades,
p195
aVgangstas, gangsta gardeners.
p196
aVWe gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is.
p197
aVIf you ain't a gardener, you ain't gangsta.
p198
aVGet gangsta with your shovel, okay?
p199
aVAnd let that be your weapon of choice.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Applause)
p202
aa(lp203
VSo basically, if you want to meet with me,
p204
aVyou know, if you want to meet,
p205
aVdon't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs
p206
aVand have meetings where you talk about doing some shit \u2014
p207
aVwhere you talk about doing some shit.
p208
aVIf you want to meet with me, come to the garden
p209
aVwith your shovel so we can plant some shit.
p210
aa(lp211
VPeace. Thank you.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Applause)
p214
aVThank you. (Applause)
