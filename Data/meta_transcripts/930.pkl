VThe global challenge that I want to talk to you about today
p4
aVrarely makes the front pages.
p5
aVIt, however, is enormous
p6
aVin both scale and importance.
p7
aVLook, you all are very well traveled;
p8
aVthis is TEDGlobal after all.
p9
aVBut I do hope to take you to some places
p10
aVyou've never been to before.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo, let's start off in China.
p13
aVThis photo was taken two weeks ago.
p14
aVActually, one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders
p15
aVhas just graduated from high school.
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aVBut this is Tiananmen Square.
p18
aVMany of you have been there. It's not the real China.
p19
aVLet me take you to the real China.
p20
aVThis is in the Dabian Mountains
p21
aVin the remote part of Hubei province in central China.
p22
aVDai Manju is 13 years old at the time the story starts.
p23
aVShe lives with her parents,
p24
aVher two brothers and her great-aunt.
p25
aVThey have a hut that has no electricity,
p26
aVno running water,
p27
aVno wristwatch, no bicycle.
p28
aVAnd they share this great splendor
p29
aVwith a very large pig.
p30
aVDai Manju was in sixth grade when her parents said,
p31
aV"We're going to pull you out of school
p32
aVbecause the 13-dollar school fees are too much for us.
p33
aVYou're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies.
p34
aVWhy would we waste this money on you?"
p35
aVThis is what happens to girls in remote areas.
p36
aa(lp37
VTurns out that Dai Manju was
p38
aVthe best pupil in her grade.
p39
aVShe still made the two-hour trek to the schoolhouse
p40
aVand tried to catch every little bit of information
p41
aVthat seeped out of the doors.
p42
aVWe wrote about her in The New York Times.
p43
aVWe got a flood of donations \u2014
p44
aVmostly 13-dollar checks
p45
aVbecause New York Times readers are very generous
p46
aVin tiny amounts
p47
aV(Laughter)
p48
aVbut then, we got a money transfer
p49
aVfor $10,000 \u2014
p50
aVreally nice guy.
p51
aVWe turned the money over to that man there, the principal of the school.
p52
aVHe was delighted.
p53
aVHe thought, "Oh, I can renovate the school.
p54
aVI can give scholarships to all the girls,
p55
aVyou know, if they work hard and stay in school.
p56
aVSo Dai Manju basically
p57
aVfinished out middle school.
p58
aVShe went to high school.
p59
aVShe went to vocational school for accounting.
p60
aVShe scouted for jobs down in Guangdong province in the south.
p61
aVShe found a job, she scouted for jobs
p62
aVfor her classmates and her friends.
p63
aVShe sent money back to her family.
p64
aVThey built a new house,
p65
aVthis time with running water,
p66
aVelectricity, a bicycle,
p67
aVno pig.
p68
aa(lp69
VWhat we saw was a natural experiment.
p70
aVIt is rare to get an exogenous investment
p71
aVin girls' education.
p72
aVAnd over the years, as we followed Dai Manju, we were able to see
p73
aVthat she was able to move out of a vicious cycle
p74
aVand into a virtuous cycle.
p75
aVShe not only changed her own dynamic,
p76
aVshe changed her household, she changed her family, her village.
p77
aVThe village became a real standout.
p78
aVOf course, most of China was flourishing at the time,
p79
aVbut they were able to get a road built
p80
aVto link them up to the rest of China.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd that brings me to my first major
p83
aVof two tenets of "Half the Sky."
p84
aVAnd that is that
p85
aVthe central moral challenge
p86
aVof this century
p87
aVis gender inequity.
p88
aVIn the 19th century, it was slavery.
p89
aVIn the 20th century, it was totalitarianism.
p90
aVThe cause of our time
p91
aVis the brutality that so many people
p92
aVface around the world because of their gender.
p93
aVSo some of you may be thinking,
p94
aV"Gosh, that's hyperbole.
p95
aVShe's exaggerating."
p96
aVWell, let me ask you this question.
p97
aVHow many of you think there are more males or more females in the world?
p98
aVLet me take a poll. How many of you think there are more males in the world?
p99
aVHands up, please.
p100
aVHow many of you think \u2014 a few \u2014 how many of you there are more females in the world?
p101
aVOkay, most of you.
p102
aVWell, you know this latter group, you're wrong.
p103
aVThere are, true enough,
p104
aVin Europe and the West,
p105
aVwhen women and men
p106
aVhave equal access to food and health care,
p107
aVthere are more women, we live longer.
p108
aVBut in most of the rest of the world, that's not the case.
p109
aVIn fact, demographers have shown
p110
aVthat there are anywhere between 60 million
p111
aVand 100 million
p112
aVmissing females in the current population.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd, you know, it happens for several reasons.
p115
aVFor instance, in the last half-century,
p116
aVmore girls were discriminated to death
p117
aVthan all the people killed on all the battlefields
p118
aVin the 20th century.
p119
aVSometimes it's also because of the sonogram.
p120
aVGirls get aborted before they're even born
p121
aVwhen there are scarce resources.
p122
aVThis girl here, for instance,
p123
aVis in a feeding center in Ethiopia.
p124
aVThe entire center was filled with girls like her.
p125
aVWhat's remarkable is that her brothers, in the same family,
p126
aVwere totally fine.
p127
aVIn India, in the first year of life,
p128
aVfrom zero to one,
p129
aVboy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate
p130
aVbecause they depend upon the breast,
p131
aVand the breast shows no son preference.
p132
aVFrom one to five,
p133
aVgirls die at a 50 percent higher mortality rate
p134
aVthan boys, in all of India.
p135
aa(lp136
VThe second tenet of "Half the Sky"
p137
aVis that, let's put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all,
p138
aVand just on a purely practical level,
p139
aVwe think that
p140
aVone of the best ways to fight poverty and to fight terrorism
p141
aVis to educate girls
p142
aVand to bring women into the formal labor force.
p143
aVPoverty, for instance.
p144
aVThere are three reasons why this is the case.
p145
aVFor one, overpopulation is one of
p146
aVthe persistent causes of poverty.
p147
aVAnd you know, when you educate a boy,
p148
aVhis family tends to have fewer kids,
p149
aVbut only slightly.
p150
aVWhen you educate a girl,
p151
aVshe tends to have significantly fewer kids.
p152
aVThe second reason is
p153
aVit has to do with spending.
p154
aVIt's kind of like the dirty, little secret of poverty,
p155
aVwhich is that,
p156
aVnot only do poor people
p157
aVtake in very little income,
p158
aVbut also, the income that they take in,
p159
aVthey don't spend it very wisely,
p160
aVand unfortunately, most of that spending is done by men.
p161
aVSo research has shown,
p162
aVif you look at people who live under two dollars a day \u2014
p163
aVone metric of poverty \u2014
p164
aVtwo percent of that take-home pay
p165
aVgoes to this basket here, in education.
p166
aV20 percent goes to a basket that is a combination of
p167
aValcohol, tobacco, sugary drinks \u2014
p168
aVand prostitution and festivals.
p169
aVIf you just take four percentage points
p170
aVand put it into this basket,
p171
aVyou would have a transformative effect.
p172
aa(lp173
VThe last reason has to do
p174
aVwith women being part of the solution, not the problem.
p175
aVYou need to use scarce resources.
p176
aVIt's a waste of resources if you don't use someone like Dai Manju.
p177
aVBill Gates put it very well
p178
aVwhen he was traveling through Saudi Arabia.
p179
aVHe was speaking to an audience much like yourselves.
p180
aVHowever, two-thirds of the way there was a barrier.
p181
aVOn this side was men,
p182
aVand then the barrier, and this side was women.
p183
aVAnd someone from this side of the room got up and said,
p184
aV"Mr. Gates, we have here as our goal in Saudi Arabia
p185
aVto be one of the top 10 countries
p186
aVwhen it comes to technology.
p187
aVDo you think we'll make it?"
p188
aVSo Bill Gates, as he was staring out at the audience, he said,
p189
aV"If you're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country,
p190
aVthere is no way you will get anywhere near the top 10."
p191
aVSo here is Bill of Arabia.
p192
aa(lp193
V(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VSo what would some of the specific challenges
p196
aVlook like?
p197
aVI would say, on the top of the agenda
p198
aVis sex trafficking.
p199
aVAnd I'll just say two things about this.
p200
aVThe slavery at the peak of the slave trade
p201
aVin the 1780s:
p202
aVthere were about 80,000 slaves
p203
aVtransported from Africa to the New World.
p204
aVNow, modern slavery:
p205
aVaccording to State Department rough statistics,
p206
aVthere are about 800,000 \u2014 10 times the number \u2014
p207
aVthat are trafficked across international borders.
p208
aVAnd that does not even include those
p209
aVthat are trafficked within country borders,
p210
aVwhich is a substantial portion.
p211
aVAnd if you look at
p212
aVanother factor, another contrast,
p213
aVa slave back then is worth
p214
aVabout $40,000
p215
aVin today's money.
p216
aVToday, you can buy a girl trafficked
p217
aVfor a few hundred dollars,
p218
aVwhich means she's actually more disposable.
p219
aVBut you know, there is progress being made
p220
aVin places like Cambodia and Thailand.
p221
aVWe don't have to expect a world
p222
aVwhere girls are bought and sold or killed.
p223
aa(lp224
VThe second item on the agenda
p225
aVis maternal mortality.
p226
aVYou know, childbirth in this part of the world
p227
aVis a wonderful event.
p228
aVIn Niger, one in seven women
p229
aVcan expect to die during childbirth.
p230
aVAround the world,
p231
aVone woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth.
p232
aVYou know, it's not as though
p233
aVwe don't have the technological solution,
p234
aVbut these women have three strikes against them:
p235
aVthey are poor, they are rural
p236
aVand they are female.
p237
aVYou know, for every woman who does die,
p238
aVthere are 20 who survive
p239
aVbut end up with an injury.
p240
aVAnd the most devastating injury
p241
aVis obstetric fistula.
p242
aVIt's a tearing during obstructed labor
p243
aVthat leaves a woman incontinent.
p244
aa(lp245
VLet me tell you about Mahabuba.
p246
aVShe lives in Ethiopia.
p247
aVShe was married against her will at age 13.
p248
aVShe got pregnant, ran to the bush to have the baby,
p249
aVbut you know, her body was very immature,
p250
aVand she ended up having obstructed labor.
p251
aVThe baby died, and she ended up with a fistula.
p252
aVSo that meant she was incontinent;
p253
aVshe couldn't control her wastes.
p254
aVIn a word, she stank.
p255
aVThe villagers thought she was cursed; they didn't know what to do with her.
p256
aVSo finally, they put her at the edge of the village in a hut.
p257
aVThey ripped off the door
p258
aVso that the hyenas would get her at night.
p259
aVThat night, there was a stick in the hut.
p260
aVShe fought off the hyenas with that stick.
p261
aVAnd the next morning,
p262
aVshe knew if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary,
p263
aVshe would be saved.
p264
aVBecause she had some damage to her nerves,
p265
aVshe crawled all the way \u2014 30 miles \u2014
p266
aVto that doorstep, half dead.
p267
aVThe foreign missionary opened the door,
p268
aVknew exactly what had happened,
p269
aVtook her to a nearby fistula hospital in Addis Ababa,
p270
aVand she was repaired
p271
aVwith a 350-dollar operation.
p272
aVThe doctors and nurses there noticed
p273
aVthat she was not only a survivor,
p274
aVshe was really clever, and they made her a nurse.
p275
aVSo now, Mahabuba,
p276
aVshe is saving the lives
p277
aVof hundreds, thousands, of women.
p278
aVShe has become part of the solution, not the problem.
p279
aVShe's moved out of a vicious cycle
p280
aVand into a virtuous cycle.
p281
aa(lp282
VI've talked about some of the challenges,
p283
aVlet me talk about some of the solutions,
p284
aVand there are predictable solutions.
p285
aVI've hinted at them: education
p286
aVand also economic opportunity.
p287
aVSo of course, when you educate a girl,
p288
aVshe tends to get married later on in life,
p289
aVshe tends to have kids later on in life, she tends to have fewer kids,
p290
aVand those kids that she does have,
p291
aVshe educates them in a more enlightened fashion.
p292
aVWith economic opportunity,
p293
aVit can be transformative.
p294
aa(lp295
VLet me tell you about Saima.
p296
aVShe lives in a small village outside Lahore, Pakistan.
p297
aVAnd at the time, she was miserable.
p298
aVShe was beaten every single day
p299
aVby her husband, who was unemployed.
p300
aVHe was kind of a gambler type \u2014 and unemployable, therefore \u2014
p301
aVand took his frustrations out on her.
p302
aVWell, when she had her second daughter,
p303
aVher mother in-law told her son,
p304
aV"I think you'd better get a second wife.
p305
aVSaima's not going to produce you a son."
p306
aVThis is when she had her second daughter.
p307
aVAt the time, there was
p308
aVa microlending group in the village
p309
aVthat gave her a 65-dollar loan.
p310
aVSaima took that money,
p311
aVand she started an embroidery business.
p312
aVThe merchants liked her embroidery; it sold very well,
p313
aVand they kept asking for more.
p314
aVAnd when she couldn't produce enough,
p315
aVshe hired other women in the village.
p316
aVPretty soon she had 30 women in the village
p317
aVworking for her embroidery business.
p318
aVAnd then,
p319
aVwhen she had to transport all of the embroidery goods
p320
aVfrom the village to the marketplace,
p321
aVshe needed someone to help her do the transport,
p322
aVso she hired her husband.
p323
aVSo now they're in it together.
p324
aVHe does the transportation and distribution,
p325
aVand she does the production and sourcing.
p326
aVAnd now they have a third daughter,
p327
aVand the daughters, all of them, are being tutored in education
p328
aVbecause Saima knows what's really important.
p329
aa(lp330
VWhich brings me to the final element, which is education.
p331
aVLarry Summers, when he was chief economist at the World Bank,
p332
aVonce said that, "It may well be
p333
aVthat the highest return on investment
p334
aVin the developing world
p335
aVis in girls' education."
p336
aVLet me tell you about Beatrice Biira.
p337
aVBeatrice was living in Uganda
p338
aVnear the Congo border,
p339
aVand like Dai Manju, she didn't go to school.
p340
aVActually, she had never been to school,
p341
aVnot to a lick, one day.
p342
aVHer parents, again, said,
p343
aV"Why should we spend the money on her?
p344
aVShe's going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth."
p345
aVWell, it just so happens, at that time,
p346
aVthere was a group in Connecticut
p347
aVcalled the Niantic Community Church Group in Connecticut.
p348
aVThey made a donation to an organization
p349
aVbased in Arkansas
p350
aVcalled Heifer International.
p351
aVHeifer sent two goats to Africa.
p352
aVOne of them ended up with Beatrice's parents,
p353
aVand that goat had twins.
p354
aVThe twins started producing milk.
p355
aVThey sold the milk for cash.
p356
aVThe cash started accumulating,
p357
aVand pretty soon the parents said,
p358
aV"You know, we've got enough money. Let's send Beatrice to school."
p359
aVSo at nine years of age,
p360
aVBeatrice started in first grade \u2014
p361
aVafter all, she'd never been to a lick of school \u2014
p362
aVwith a six year-old.
p363
aVNo matter, she was just delighted to be in school.
p364
aVShe rocketed to the top of her class.
p365
aVShe stayed at the top of her class
p366
aVthrough elementary school, middle school,
p367
aVand then in high school,
p368
aVshe scored brilliantly on the national examinations
p369
aVso that she became the first person in her village,
p370
aVever, to come to the United States
p371
aVon scholarship.
p372
aVTwo years ago,
p373
aVshe graduated from Connecticut College.
p374
aVOn the day of her graduation,
p375
aVshe said, "I am the luckiest girl alive
p376
aVbecause of a goat."
p377
aV(Laughter)
p378
aVAnd that goat was $120.
p379
aa(lp380
VSo you see how transformative
p381
aVlittle bits of help can be.
p382
aVBut I want to give you a reality check.
p383
aVLook: U.S. aid, helping people is not easy,
p384
aVand there have been books that have criticized U.S. aid.
p385
aVThere's Bill Easterly's book.
p386
aVThere's a book called "Dead Aid."
p387
aVYou know, the criticism is fair;
p388
aVit isn't easy.
p389
aVYou know, people say how
p390
aVhalf of all water well projects, a year later, are failed.
p391
aVWhen I was in Zimbabwe,
p392
aVwe were touring a place with the village chief \u2014
p393
aVhe wanted to raise money for a secondary school \u2014
p394
aVand there was some construction a few yards away,
p395
aVand I said, "What's that?"
p396
aVHe sort of mumbled.
p397
aVTurns out that it's a failed irrigation project.
p398
aVA few yards away was a failed chicken coop.
p399
aVOne year, all the chickens died, and no one wanted to put the chickens in there.
p400
aVIt's true, but we think that you don't through the baby out with the bathwater;
p401
aVyou actually improve.
p402
aVYou learn from your mistakes, and you continuously improve.
p403
aa(lp404
VWe also think that individuals
p405
aVcan make a difference, and they should,
p406
aVbecause individuals, together,
p407
aVwe can all help create a movement.
p408
aVAnd a movement of men and women
p409
aVis what's needed to bring about social change,
p410
aVchange that will address
p411
aVthis great moral challenge.
p412
aVSo then, I ask,
p413
aVwhat's in it for you?
p414
aVYou're probably asking that. Why should you care?
p415
aVI will just leave you with two things.
p416
aVOne is that research shows
p417
aVthat once you have
p418
aVall of your material needs taken care of \u2014
p419
aVwhich most of us, all of us, here in this room do \u2014
p420
aVresearch shows that
p421
aVthere are very few things in life
p422
aVthat can actually elevate your level of happiness.
p423
aVOne of those things
p424
aVis contributing to a cause larger than yourself.
p425
aa(lp426
VAnd the second thing,
p427
aVit's an anecdote that I'll leave you with.
p428
aVAnd that is the story
p429
aVof an aid worker in Darfur.
p430
aVHere was a woman
p431
aVwho had worked in Darfur,
p432
aVseeing things that no human being should see.
p433
aVThroughout her time there,
p434
aVshe was strong, she was steadfast.
p435
aVShe never broke down.
p436
aVAnd then she came back to the United States
p437
aVand was on break, Christmas break.
p438
aVShe was in her grandmother's backyard,
p439
aVand she saw something that made her break down in tears.
p440
aVWhat that was
p441
aVwas a bird feeder.
p442
aVAnd she realized that she had the great fortune
p443
aVto be born in a country
p444
aVwhere we take security for granted,
p445
aVwhere we not only can feed, clothe
p446
aVand house ourselves,
p447
aVbut also provide for wild birds
p448
aVso they don't go hungry in the winter.
p449
aVAnd she realized that with that great fortune
p450
aVcomes great responsibility.
p451
aVAnd so, like her,
p452
aVyou, me,
p453
aVwe have all won the lottery of life.
p454
aVAnd so the question becomes:
p455
aVhow do we discharge that responsibility?
p456
aa(lp457
VSo, here's the cause.
p458
aVJoin the movement.
p459
aVFeel happier and help save the world.
p460
aa(lp461
VThank you very much.
