VI spent the better part of a decade
p4
aVlooking at American responses to mass atrocity and genocide.
p5
aVAnd I'd like to start by sharing with you one moment
p6
aVthat to me sums up what there is to know
p7
aVabout American and democratic responses to mass atrocity.
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd that moment came on April 21, 1994.
p10
aVSo 14 years ago, almost, in the middle of the Rwandan genocide,
p11
aVin which 800,000 people would be systematically exterminated
p12
aVby the Rwandan government and some extremist militia.
p13
aVOn April 21, in the New York Times,
p14
aVthe paper reported that somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 people
p15
aVhad already been killed in the genocide.
p16
aVIt was in the paper \u2014 not on the front page.
p17
aVIt was a lot like the Holocaust coverage,
p18
aVit was buried in the paper.
p19
aVRwanda itself was not seen as newsworthy,
p20
aVand amazingly, genocide itself was not seen as newsworthy.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut on April 21, a wonderfully honest moment occurred.
p23
aVAnd that was that an American congresswoman
p24
aVnamed Patricia Schroeder from Colorado
p25
aVmet with a group of journalists.
p26
aVAnd one of the journalists said to her, what's up?
p27
aVWhat's going on in the U.S. government?
p28
aVTwo to 300,000 people have just been exterminated
p29
aVin the last couple of weeks in Rwanda.
p30
aVIt's two weeks into the genocide at that time,
p31
aVbut of course, at that time you don't know how long it's going to last.
p32
aVAnd the journalist said, why is there so little response out of Washington?
p33
aVWhy no hearings, no denunciations,
p34
aVno people getting arrested in front of the Rwandan embassy
p35
aVor in front of the White House? What's the deal?
p36
aVAnd she said \u2014 she was so honest \u2014 she said, "It's a great question.
p37
aVAll I can tell you is that in my congressional office in Colorado
p38
aVand my office in Washington,
p39
aVwe're getting hundreds and hundreds of calls
p40
aVabout the endangered ape and gorilla population in Rwanda,
p41
aVbut nobody is calling about the people.
p42
aVThe phones just aren't ringing about the people."
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd the reason I give you this moment is there's a deep truth in it.
p45
aVAnd that truth is, or was, in the 20th century,
p46
aVthat while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements,
p47
aVwe didn't have an endangered people's movement.
p48
aVWe had Holocaust education in the schools.
p49
aVMost of us were groomed not only on images of nuclear catastrophe,
p50
aVbut also on images and knowledge of the Holocaust.
p51
aVThere's a museum, of course, on the Mall in Washington,
p52
aVright next to Lincoln and Jefferson.
p53
aVI mean, we have owned Never Again culturally,
p54
aVappropriately, interestingly.
p55
aVAnd yet the politicization of Never Again,
p56
aVthe operationalization of Never Again,
p57
aVhad never occurred in the 20th century.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd that's what that moment with Patricia Schroeder I think shows:
p60
aVthat if we are to bring about an end to the world's worst atrocities,
p61
aVwe have to make it such.
p62
aVThere has to be a role \u2014
p63
aVthere has to be the creation of political noise and political costs
p64
aVin response to massive crimes against humanity, and so forth.
p65
aVSo that was the 20th century.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow here \u2014 and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon \u2014
p68
aVthere is good news, amazing news, in the 21st century,
p69
aVand that is that, almost out of nowhere, there has come into being
p70
aVan anti-genocide movement, an anti-genocide constituency,
p71
aVand one that looks destined, in fact, to be permanent.
p72
aVIt grew up in response to the atrocities in Darfur.
p73
aVIt is comprised of students. There are something like 300 anti-genocide chapters
p74
aVon college campuses around the country.
p75
aVIt's bigger than the anti-apartheid movement.
p76
aVThere are something like 500 high school chapters
p77
aVdevoted to stopping the genocide in Darfur.
p78
aVEvangelicals have joined it. Jewish groups have joined it.
p79
aV"Hotel Rwanda" watchers have joined it. It is a cacophonous movement.
p80
aa(lp81
VTo call it a movement, as with all movements, perhaps, is a little misleading.
p82
aVIt's diverse. It's got a lot of different approaches.
p83
aVIt's got all the ups and the downs of movements.
p84
aVBut it has been amazingly successful in one regard,
p85
aVin that it has become,
p86
aVit has congealed into this endangered people's movement
p87
aVthat was missing in the 20th century.
p88
aVIt sees itself, such as it is, the it,
p89
aVas something that will create the impression that there will be political cost,
p90
aVthere will be a political price to be paid,
p91
aVfor allowing genocide, for not having an heroic imagination,
p92
aVfor not being an upstander but for being, in fact, a bystander.
p93
aa(lp94
VNow because it's student-driven,
p95
aVthere's some amazing things that the movement has done.
p96
aVThey have launched a divestment campaign
p97
aVthat has now convinced, I think, 55 universities in 22 states
p98
aVto divest their holdings of stocks
p99
aVwith regard to companies doing business in Sudan.
p100
aVThey have a 1-800-GENOCIDE number \u2014
p101
aVthis is going to sound very kitsch,
p102
aVbut for those of you who may not be, I mean, may be apolitical,
p103
aVbut interested in doing something about genocide,
p104
aVyou dial 1-800-GENOCIDE and you type in your zip code,
p105
aVand you don't even have to know who your congressperson is.
p106
aVIt will refer you directly to your congressperson, to your U.S. senator,
p107
aVto your governor where divestment legislation is pending.
p108
aVThey've lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide.
p109
aVI think the most innovative thing they've introduced recently
p110
aVare genocide grades.
p111
aVAnd it takes students to introduce genocide grades.
p112
aVSo what you now have when a Congress is in session
p113
aVis members of Congress calling up these 19-year-olds or 24-year-olds
p114
aVand saying, I'm just told I have a D minus on genocide;
p115
aVwhat do I do to get a C? I just want to get a C. Help me.
p116
aVAnd the students and the others
p117
aVwho are part of this incredibly energized base
p118
aVare there to answer that, and there's always something to do.
p119
aa(lp120
VNow, what this movement has done is it has extracted from the Bush administration
p121
aVfrom the United States,
p122
aVat a time of massive over-stretch \u2014 military, financial, diplomatic \u2014
p123
aVa whole series of commitments to Darfur
p124
aVthat no other country in the world is making.
p125
aVFor instance, the referral of the crimes in Darfur
p126
aVto the International Criminal Court,
p127
aVwhich the Bush administration doesn't like.
p128
aVThe expenditure of 3 billion dollars in refugee camps to try to keep,
p129
aVbasically, the people who've been displaced from their homes
p130
aVby the Sudanese government, by the so-called Janjaweed, the militia,
p131
aVto keep those people alive
p132
aVuntil something more durable can be achieved.
p133
aVAnd recently, or now not that recently,
p134
aVabout six months ago, the authorization of a peacekeeping force
p135
aVof 26,000 that will go.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd that's all the Bush administration's leadership,
p138
aVand it's all because of this bottom-up pressure
p139
aVand the fact that the phones haven't stopped ringing
p140
aVfrom the beginning of this crisis.
p141
aVThe bad news, however, to this question of will evil prevail,
p142
aVis that evil lives on.
p143
aVThe people in those camps are surrounded on all sides
p144
aVby so-called Janjaweed, these men on horseback
p145
aVwith spears and Kalashnikovs.
p146
aVWomen who go to get firewood in order to heat the humanitarian aid
p147
aVin order to feed their families \u2014 humanitarian aid,
p148
aVthe dirty secret of it is it has to be heated, really, to be edible \u2014
p149
aVare themselves subjected to rape,
p150
aVwhich is a tool of the genocide that is being used.
p151
aVAnd the peacekeepers I've mentioned, the force has been authorized,
p152
aVbut almost no country on Earth has stepped forward since the authorization
p153
aVto actually put its troops or its police in harm's way.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo we have achieved an awful lot relative to the 20th century,
p156
aVand yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding
p157
aVas we sit here, as we speak.
p158
aVWhy the limits to the movement?
p159
aVWhy is what has been achieved, or what the movement has done,
p160
aVbeen necessary but not sufficient to the crime?
p161
aVI think there are a couple \u2014 there are many reasons \u2014
p162
aVbut a couple just to focus on briefly.
p163
aa(lp164
VThe first is that the movement, such as it is,
p165
aVstops at America's borders.  It is not a global movement.
p166
aVIt does not have too many compatriots abroad who themselves
p167
aVare asking their governments to do more to stop genocide.
p168
aVAnd the Holocaust culture that we have in this country
p169
aVmakes Americans, sort of, more prone to, I think,
p170
aVwant to bring Never Again to life.
p171
aVThe guilt that the Clinton administration expressed,
p172
aVthat Bill Clinton expressed over Rwanda,
p173
aVcreated a space in our society for a consensus
p174
aVthat Rwanda was bad and wrong
p175
aVand we wish we had done more, and that is something
p176
aVthat the movement has taken advantage of.
p177
aVEuropean governments, for the most part,
p178
aVhaven't acknowledged responsibility, and there's nothing to kind of
p179
aVto push back and up against.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo this movement, if it's to be durable and global,
p182
aVwill have to cross borders, and you will have to see
p183
aVother citizens in democracies, not simply resting on the assumption
p184
aVthat their government would do something in the face of genocide,
p185
aVbut actually making it such.
p186
aVGovernments will never gravitate towards crimes of this magnitude
p187
aVnaturally or eagerly.
p188
aVAs we saw, they haven't even gravitated towards protecting our ports
p189
aVor reigning in loose nukes.
p190
aVWhy would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself
p191
aVtowards distant suffering?
p192
aVSo one reason is it hasn't gone global.
p193
aa(lp194
VThe second is, of course, that at this time in particular in America's history,
p195
aVwe have a credibility problem,
p196
aVa legitimacy problem in international institutions.
p197
aVIt is structurally really, really hard to do,
p198
aVas the Bush administration rightly does,
p199
aVwhich is to denounce genocide on a Monday
p200
aVand then describe water boarding on a Tuesday as a no-brainer
p201
aVand then turn up on Wednesday and look for troop commitments.
p202
aVNow, other countries have their own reasons for not wanting to get involved.
p203
aVLet me be clear.
p204
aVThey're in some ways using the Bush administration as an alibi.
p205
aVBut it is essential for us to be a leader in this sphere,
p206
aVof course to restore our standing and our leadership in the world.
p207
aVThe recovery's going to take some time.
p208
aa(lp209
VWe have to ask ourselves, what now? What do we do going forward
p210
aVas a country and as citizens in relationship to the world's worst places,
p211
aVthe world's worst suffering, killers, and the kinds of killers
p212
aVthat could come home to roost sometime in the future?
p213
aVThe place that I turned to answer that question was to a man
p214
aVthat many of you may not have ever heard of,
p215
aVand that is a Brazilian named Sergio Vieira de Mello who,
p216
aVas Chris said, was blown up in Iraq in 2003.
p217
aVHe was the victim of the first-ever suicide bomb in Iraq.
p218
aVIt's hard to remember, but there was actually a time in the summer of 2003,
p219
aVeven after the U.S. invasion, where,
p220
aVapart from looting, civilians were relatively safe in Iraq.
p221
aa(lp222
VNow, who was Sergio? Sergio Vieira de Mello was his name.
p223
aVIn addition to being Brazilian, he was described to me
p224
aVbefore I met him in 1994 as someone who was a cross between
p225
aVJames Bond on the one hand and Bobby Kennedy on the other.
p226
aVAnd in the U.N., you don't get that many people
p227
aVwho actually manage to merge those qualities.
p228
aVHe was James Bond-like in that he was ingenious.
p229
aVHe was drawn to the flames, he chased the flames,
p230
aVhe was like a moth to the flames. Something of an adrenalin junkie.
p231
aVHe was successful with women.
p232
aVHe was Bobby Kennedy-like because in some ways one could never tell
p233
aVif he was a realist masquerading as an idealist
p234
aVor an idealist masquerading as a realist, as people always wondered
p235
aVabout Bobby Kennedy and John Kennedy in that way.
p236
aa(lp237
VWhat he was was a decathlete of nation-building, of problem-solving,
p238
aVof troubleshooting in the world's worst places
p239
aVand in the world's most broken places.
p240
aVIn failing states, genocidal states, under-governed states,
p241
aVprecisely the kinds of places that threats to this country exist
p242
aVon the horizon, and precisely the kinds of places
p243
aVwhere most of the world's suffering tends to get concentrated.
p244
aVThese are the places he was drawn to.
p245
aVHe moved with the headlines.
p246
aVHe was in the U.N. for 34 years. He joined at the age of 21.
p247
aVStarted off when the causes in the wars du jour in the '70s
p248
aVwere wars of independence and decolonization.
p249
aVHe was there in Bangladesh
p250
aVdealing with the outflow of millions of refugees \u2014
p251
aVthe largest refugee flow in history up to that point.
p252
aVHe was in Sudan when the civil war broke out there.
p253
aVHe was in Cyprus right after the Turkish invasion.
p254
aVHe was in Mozambique for the War of Independence.
p255
aVHe was in Lebanon. Amazingly, he was in Lebanon \u2014 the U.N. base was used \u2014
p256
aVPalestinians staged attacks out from behind the U.N. base.
p257
aVIsrael then invaded and overran the U.N. base.
p258
aa(lp259
VSergio was in Beirut when the U.S. Embassy was hit
p260
aVby the first-ever suicide attack against the United States.
p261
aVPeople date the beginning of this new era to 9/11, but surely 1983,
p262
aVwith the attack on the US Embassy and the Marine barracks \u2014
p263
aVwhich Sergio witnessed \u2014 those are, in fact, in some ways,
p264
aVthe dawning of the era that we find ourselves in today.
p265
aVFrom Lebanon he went to Bosnia in the '90s.
p266
aVThe issues were, of course, ethnic sectarian violence.
p267
aVHe was the first person to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge.
p268
aVTalk about evil prevailing. I mean, here he was in the room
p269
aVwith the embodiment of evil in Cambodia.
p270
aVHe negotiates with the Serbs.
p271
aVHe actually crosses so far into this realm of talking to evil
p272
aVand trying to convince evil that it doesn't need to prevail
p273
aVthat he earns the nickname \u2014 not Sergio but Serbio
p274
aVwhile he's living in the Balkans and conducting these kinds of negotiations.
p275
aa(lp276
VHe then goes to Rwanda and to Congo in the aftermath of the genocide,
p277
aVand he's the guy who has to decide \u2014 huh, OK, the genocide is over;
p278
aV800,000 people have been killed; the people responsible are fleeing
p279
aVinto neighboring countries \u2014 into Congo, into Tanzania.
p280
aVI'm Sergio, I'm a humanitarian, and I want to feed those \u2014
p281
aVwell, I don't want to feed the killers
p282
aVbut I want to feed the two million people who are with them, so we're going to go,
p283
aVwe're going to set up camps,
p284
aVand we're going to supply humanitarian aid.
p285
aVBut, uh-oh, the killers are within the camps.
p286
aVWell, I'd like to separate the sheep from the wolves.
p287
aVLet me go door-to-door to the international community
p288
aVand see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation.
p289
aVAnd their response, of course, was no more than we wanted
p290
aVto stop the genocide and put our troops in harm's way to do that,
p291
aVnor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps.
p292
aa(lp293
VSo then you have to make the decision.
p294
aVDo you turn off the international spigot of life support
p295
aVand risk two million civilian lives?
p296
aVOr do you continue feeding the civilians, knowing that the genocidaires
p297
aVare in the camps, literally sharpening their knives for future battle?
p298
aVWhat do you do?
p299
aVIt's all lesser-evil terrain in these broken places.
p300
aa(lp301
VLate '90s: nation-building is the cause du jour.
p302
aVHe's the guy put in charge. He's the Paul Bremer or the Jerry Bremer
p303
aVof first Kosovo and then East Timor. He governs the places.
p304
aVHe's the viceroy. He has to decide on tax policy, on currency,
p305
aVon border patrol, on policing. He has to make all these judgments.
p306
aVHe's a Brazilian in these places. He speaks seven languages.
p307
aVHe's been up to that point in 14 war zones
p308
aVso he's positioned to make better judgments, perhaps,
p309
aVthan people who have never done that kind of work.
p310
aVBut nonetheless, he is the cutting edge of our experimentation
p311
aVwith doing good with very few resources being brought to bear in,
p312
aVagain, the world's worst places.
p313
aa(lp314
VAnd then after Timor, 9/11 has happened,
p315
aVhe's named U.N. Human Rights Commissioner,
p316
aVand he has to balance liberty and security and figure out,
p317
aVwhat do you do when the most powerful country in the United Nations
p318
aVis bowing out of the Geneva Conventions,
p319
aVbowing out of international law? Do you denounce?
p320
aVWell, if you denounce,
p321
aVyou're probably never going to get back in the room.
p322
aVMaybe you stay reticent. Maybe you try to charm President Bush \u2014
p323
aVand that's what he did. And in so doing he earned himself,
p324
aVunfortunately, his final and tragic appointment to Iraq \u2014
p325
aVthe one that resulted in his death.
p326
aa(lp327
VOne note on his death, which is so devastating,
p328
aVis that despite predicating the war on Iraq
p329
aVon a link between Saddam Hussein and terrorism in 9/11,
p330
aVbelieve it or not, the Bush administration or the invaders
p331
aVdid no planning, no pre-war planning, to respond to terrorism.
p332
aVSo Sergio \u2014 this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil
p333
aVand how to deal with brokenness,
p334
aVlay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue.
p335
aVStateless. The guy who tried to help the stateless people his whole career.
p336
aVLike a refugee. Because he represents the U.N.
p337
aa(lp338
VIf you represent everyone, in some ways you represent no one.
p339
aVYou're un-owned.
p340
aVAnd what the American \u2014 the most powerful military in the history of mankind
p341
aVwas able to muster for his rescue,
p342
aVbelieve it or not, was literally these heroic two American soldiers
p343
aVwent into the shaft. Building was shaking.
p344
aVOne of them had been at 9/11 and lost his buddies on September 11th,
p345
aVand yet went in and risked his life in order to save Sergio.
p346
aVBut all they had was a woman's handbag \u2014
p347
aVliterally one of those basket handbags \u2014
p348
aVand they tied it to a curtain rope from one of the offices at U.N. headquarters,
p349
aVand created a pulley system into this shaft in this quivering building
p350
aVin the interests of rescuing this person,
p351
aVthe person we most need to turn to now, this shepherd,
p352
aVat a time when so many of us feel like we're lacking guidance.
p353
aa(lp354
VAnd this was the pulley system. This was what we were able to muster for Sergio.
p355
aVThe good news, for what it's worth,
p356
aVis after Sergio and 21 others were killed that day in the attack on the U.N.,
p357
aVthe military created a search and rescue unit
p358
aVthat had the cutting equipment, the shoring wood, the cranes,
p359
aVthe things that you would have needed to do the rescue.
p360
aVBut it was too late for Sergio.
p361
aa(lp362
VI want to wrap up, but I want to close
p363
aVwith what I take to be the four lessons from Sergio's life
p364
aVon this question of how do we prevent evil from prevailing,
p365
aVwhich is how I would have framed the question.
p366
aVHere's this guy who got a 34-year head start
p367
aVthinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with,
p368
aVwe as citizens are grappling with now. What do we take away?
p369
aa(lp370
VFirst, I think, is his relationship to, in fact, evil is something to learn from.
p371
aVHe, over the course of his career, changed a great deal.
p372
aVHe had a lot of flaws, but he was very adaptive.
p373
aVI think that was his greatest quality.
p374
aVHe started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers,
p375
aVhe would charge up to people who were violating international law,
p376
aVand he would say, you're violating, this is the U.N. Charter.
p377
aVDon't you see it's unacceptable what you're doing?
p378
aVAnd they would laugh at him because he didn't have the power of states,
p379
aVthe power of any military or police.
p380
aVHe just had the rules, he had the norms, and he tried to use them.
p381
aVAnd in Lebanon, Southern Lebanon in '82,
p382
aVhe said to himself and to everybody else,
p383
aVI will never use the word "unacceptable" again.
p384
aVI will never use it. I will try to make it such,
p385
aVbut I will never use that word again.
p386
aVBut he lunged in the opposite direction.
p387
aVHe started, as I mentioned, to get in the room with evil,
p388
aVto not denounce, and became almost obsequious
p389
aVwhen he won the nickname Serbio, for instance,
p390
aVand even when he negotiated with the Khmer Rouge
p391
aVwould black-box what had occurred prior to entering the room.

aa(lp393
VBut by the end of his life, I think he had struck a balance
p394
aVthat we as a country can learn from.
p395
aVBe in the room, don't be afraid of talking to your adversaries,
p396
aVbut don't bracket what happened before you entered the room.
p397
aVDon't black-box history. Don't check your principles at the door.
p398
aVAnd I think that's something that we have to be in the room,
p399
aVwhether it's Nixon going to China or Khrushchev and Kennedy
p400
aVor Reagan and Gorbachev.
p401
aVAll the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries
p402
aVhas come by going into the room.
p403
aVAnd it doesn't have to be an act of weakness.
p404
aVYou can actually do far more to build an international coalition
p405
aVagainst a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room
p406
aVand showing to the rest of the world that that person, that regime,
p407
aVis the problem and that you, the United States, are not the problem.
p408
aa(lp409
VSecond take-away from Sergio's life, briefly.
p410
aVWhat I take away, and this in some ways is the most important,
p411
aVhe espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity
p412
aVthat was really, really unusual.
p413
aVAt a micro level, the individuals around him were visible.
p414
aVHe saw them.
p415
aVAt a macro level, he thought, you know,
p416
aVwe talk about democracy promotion, but we do it in a way sometimes
p417
aVthat's an affront to people's dignity.
p418
aVWe put people on humanitarian aid
p419
aVand we boast about it because we've spent three billion.
p420
aVIt's incredibly important,
p421
aVthose people would no longer be alive if the United States, for instance,
p422
aVhadn't spent that money in Darfur,
p423
aVbut it's not a way to live.
p424
aVIf we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens
p425
aVand as individuals with relation to the people around us,
p426
aVand as a country, if we could inject a regard for dignity
p427
aVinto our dealings with other countries,
p428
aVit would be something of a revolution.
p429
aa(lp430
VThird point, very briefly. He talked a lot about freedom from fear.
p431
aVAnd I recognize there is so much to be afraid of.
p432
aVThere are so many genuine threats in the world.
p433
aVBut what Sergio was talking about is,
p434
aVlet's calibrate our relationship to the threat.
p435
aVLet's not hype the threat; let's actually see it clearly.
p436
aVWe have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps.
p437
aVWe have reason to be afraid that we haven't secured
p438
aVloose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.
p439
aVLet's focus on what are the legitimate challenges and threats,
p440
aVbut not lunge into bad decisions because of a panic, of a fear.
p441
aVIn times of fear, for instance, one of the things Sergio used to say
p442
aVis, fear is a bad advisor.
p443
aVWe lunge towards the extremes
p444
aVwhen we aren't operating and trying to, again,
p445
aVcalibrate our relationship to the world around us.
p446
aa(lp447
VFourth and final point: he somehow, because he was working
p448
aVin all the world's worst places and all lesser evils,
p449
aVhad a humility, of course,
p450
aVand an awareness of the complexity of the world around him.
p451
aVI mean, such an acute awareness of how hard it was.
p452
aVHow Sisyphean this task was of mending,
p453
aVand yet aware of that complexity,
p454
aVhumbled by it, he wasn't paralyzed by it.
p455
aVAnd we as citizens, as we go through this experience of the kind of,
p456
aVthe crisis of confidence, crisis of competence, crisis of legitimacy,
p457
aVI think there's a temptation to pull back from the world and say,
p458
aVah, Katrina, Iraq \u2014 we don't know what we're doing.
p459
aVWe can't afford to pull back from the world.
p460
aVIt's a question of how to be in the world.
p461
aa(lp462
VAnd the lesson, I think,
p463
aVof the anti-genocide movement that I mentioned,
p464
aVthat is a partial success but by no means
p465
aVhas it achieved what it has set out to do \u2014
p466
aVit'll be many decades, probably, before that happens \u2014
p467
aVbut is that if we want to see change, we have to become the change.
p468
aVWe can't rely upon our institutions to do the work
p469
aVof necessarily talking to adversaries on their own
p470
aVwithout us creating a space for that to happen,
p471
aVfor having respect for dignity,
p472
aVand for bringing that combination of humility
p473
aVand a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility
p474
aVto our dealings with the rest of the world.
p475
aVSo will evil prevail? Is that the question?
p476
aVI think the short answer is: no, not unless we let it.
p477
aa(lp478
VThank you.
