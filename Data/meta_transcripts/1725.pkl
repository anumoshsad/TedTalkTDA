VI've noticed something interesting about society and culture.
p4
aVEverything risky requires a license.
p5
aVSo, learning to drive, owning a gun, getting married.
p6
aVThere's a certain \u2014
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VThat's true in everything risky, except technology.
p11
aVFor some reason, there's no standard syllabus,
p12
aVthere's no basic course.
p13
aVThey just sort of give you your computer and then kick you out of the nest.
p14
aVYou're supposed to learn this stuff \u2014 how?
p15
aVJust by osmosis.
p16
aVNobody ever sits down and tells you, "This is how it works."
p17
aVSo today I'm going to tell you ten things
p18
aVthat you thought everybody knew, but it turns out they don't.
p19
aa(lp20
VFirst of all, on the web, if you want to scroll down,
p21
aVdon't pick up the mouse and use the scroll bar.
p22
aVThat's a terrible waste of time.
p23
aVDo that only if you're paid by the hour.
p24
aVInstead, hit the space bar.
p25
aVThe space bar scrolls down one page.
p26
aVHold down the Shift key to scroll back up again.
p27
aVSo, space bar to scroll down one page; works in every browser,
p28
aVin every kind of computer.
p29
aa(lp30
VAlso on the web, when you're filling in one of these forms like your addresses,
p31
aVI assume you know that you can hit the Tab key
p32
aVto jump from box to box to box.
p33
aVBut what about the pop-up menu where you put in your state?
p34
aVDon't open the pop-up menu.
p35
aVThat's a terrible waste of calories.
p36
aVType the first letter of your state over and over and over.
p37
aVSo if you want Connecticut, go, C, C, C.
p38
aVIf you want Texas, go T, T, and you jump right to that thing
p39
aVwithout even opening the pop-up menu.
p40
aa(lp41
VAlso on the web, when the text is too small,
p42
aVwhat you do is hold down the Control key and hit plus, plus, plus.
p43
aVYou make the text larger with each tap.
p44
aVWorks on every computer, every web browser,
p45
aVor minus, minus, to get smaller again.
p46
aVIf you're on the Mac, it might be Command instead.
p47
aa(lp48
VWhen you're typing on your Blackberry, Android, iPhone,
p49
aVdon't bother switching layouts to the punctuation layout
p50
aVto hit the period and then a space,
p51
aVthen try to capitalize the next letter.
p52
aVJust hit the space bar twice.
p53
aVThe phone puts the period, the space, and the capital for you.
p54
aVGo space, space.
p55
aVIt is totally amazing.
p56
aa(lp57
VAlso when it comes to cell phones, on all phones,
p58
aVif you want to redial somebody that you've dialed before,
p59
aVall you have to do is hit the call button,
p60
aVand it puts the last phone number into the box for you,
p61
aVand at that point you can hit call again to actually dial it.
p62
aVNo need to go to the recent calls list if you're trying to call somebody
p63
aVjust hit the call button again.
p64
aa(lp65
VSomething that drives me crazy:
p66
aVWhen I call you and leave a message on your voice mail,
p67
aVI hear you saying, "Leave a message,"
p68
aVand then I get these 15 seconds of freaking instructions,
p69
aVlike we haven't had answering machines for 45 years!
p70
aa(lp71
V(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
VI'm not bitter.
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VSo it turns out there's a keyboard shortcut
p78
aVthat lets you jump directly to the beep like this.
p79
aa(lp80
VPhone: At the tone, please...
p81
aa(lp82
V(Beep)
p83
aa(lp84
VDavid Pogue: Unfortunately, the carriers didn't adopt
p85
aVthe same keystroke, so it's different by carrier,
p86
aVso it devolves upon you to learn the keystroke
p87
aVfor the person you're calling.
p88
aVI didn't say these were going to be perfect.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo most of you think of Google
p91
aVas something that lets you look up a web page,
p92
aVbut it is also a dictionary.
p93
aVType the word "define" and the word you want to know.
p94
aVYou don't even have to click anything.
p95
aVThere's the definition as you type.
p96
aVIt's also a complete FAA database.
p97
aVType the name of the airline and the flight.
p98
aVIt shows you where the flight is, the gate, the terminal,
p99
aVhow long until it lands.
p100
aVYou don't need an app.
p101
aVIt's also unit and currency conversion.
p102
aVAgain, you don't have to click one of the results.
p103
aVJust type it into the box, and there's your answer.
p104
aa(lp105
VWhile we're talking about text \u2014
p106
aVWhen you want to highlight \u2014
p107
aVthis is just an example \u2014
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VWhen you want to highlight a word,
p112
aVplease don't waste your life dragging across it
p113
aVwith the mouse like a newbie.
p114
aVDouble click the word.
p115
aVWatch "200" \u2014 I go double-click,
p116
aVit neatly selects just that word.
p117
aVAlso, don't delete what you've highlighted.
p118
aVYou can just type over it.
p119
aVThis is in every program.
p120
aVAlso, you can go double-click, drag,
p121
aVto highlight in one-word increments as you drag.
p122
aVMuch more precise.
p123
aVAgain, don't bother deleting.
p124
aVJust type over it.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VShutter lag is the time between your pressing the shutter button
p129
aVand the moment the camera actually snaps.
p130
aVIt's extremely frustrating on any camera under $1,000.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Camera click)
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VSo, that's because the camera needs time to calculate the focus and exposure,
p137
aVbut if you pre-focus with a half-press,
p138
aVleave your finger down \u2014
p139
aVno shutter lag!
p140
aVYou get it every time.
p141
aVI've just turned your $50 camera into a $1,000 camera with that trick.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd finally, it often happens that you're giving a talk,
p144
aVand for some reason, the audience is looking at the slide
p145
aVinstead of at you!
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VSo when that happens \u2014 this works in Keynote, PowerPoint,
p150
aVit works in every program \u2014 all you do is hit the letter B key,
p151
aVB for blackout, to black out the slide, make everybody look at you,
p152
aVand then when you're ready to go on, you hit B again,
p153
aVand if you're really on a roll, you can hit the W key for "whiteout,"
p154
aVand you white out the slide,
p155
aVand then you can hit W again to un-blank it.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo I know I went super fast.
p158
aVIf you missed anything, I'll be happy to send you the list of these tips.
p159
aVIn the meantime, congratulations.
p160
aVYou all get your California Technology License.
p161
aa(lp162
VHave a great day.
