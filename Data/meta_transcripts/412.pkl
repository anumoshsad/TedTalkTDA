VIn 1962, Buckminster Fuller
p4
aVpresented the particularly audacious proposal for the Geoscope.
p5
aVIt was a 200-foot diameter geodesic sphere
p6
aVto be suspended over the East River in New York City, in full view of the United Nations.
p7
aVIt was a big idea, for sure, and it was one that he felt could truly inform
p8
aVand deeply affect the decision making of this body
p9
aVthrough animations of global data, trends
p10
aVand other information regarding the globe, on this sphere.
p11
aVAnd today, 45 years later,
p12
aVwe clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity and perspective,
p13
aVbut what we do have is improved technology.
p14
aa(lp15
VToday we don't need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display.
p16
aVWe can use LEDs.
p17
aVLEDs are smaller, they're cheaper, they're longer lasting, they're more efficient.
p18
aVMost importantly for this, they're faster.
p19
aVAnd this speed, combined with today's high-performance micro-controllers,
p20
aVallows us to actually simulate, in this piece,
p21
aVover 17,000 LEDs \u2014 using just 64.
p22
aVAnd the way this happens is through the phenomenon of persistence of vision.
p23
aVBut as this ring rotates at about 1,700 rpm \u2014 that's 28 times per second.
p24
aVThe equator's speed is actually about 60 miles per hour.
p25
aVThere are four on-board micro-controllers
p26
aVthat, each time this ring rotates
p27
aVit, as it passes the rear of the display,
p28
aVit picks up a position signal.
p29
aVAnd from that, the on-board micro-controllers
p30
aVcan extrapolate the position of the ring at all points around the revolution
p31
aVand display arbitrary bitmap images and animations.
p32
aa(lp33
VBut this is really just the beginning.
p34
aVIn addition to higher resolution versions of this display,
p35
aVmy father and I are working on a new patent-pending design
p36
aVfor a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon.
p37
aVIt achieves this by rotating LEDs about two axes.
p38
aVSo as you can see here, this is a, eleven-inch diameter circuit board.
p39
aVThese blocks represent LEDs.
p40
aVAnd so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis,
p41
aVit will create a disc of light that we can control.
p42
aVThat's nothing new: that's a propeller clock;
p43
aVthat's the rims that you can buy for your car.
p44
aVBut what is new is that, when we rotate this disc about this axis,
p45
aVthis disc of light actually becomes a sphere of light.
p46
aVAnd so we can control that with micro-controllers
p47
aVand create a fully volumetric, three-dimensional display with just 256 LEDs.
p48
aa(lp49
VNow this piece is currently in process \u2014
p50
aVdue out in May \u2014 but what we've done is we've put together a small demo,
p51
aVjust to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere.
p52
aVI've got a little video to show you,
p53
aVbut keep in mind that this is with no electronic control,
p54
aVand this is also with only four LEDs.
p55
aVThis is actually only about 1.5 percent of what the final display will be in May.
p56
aVSo, take a look.
p57
aVAnd here you can see it's rotating about the vertical axis only, creating circles.
p58
aVAnd then, as the other axis kicks in,
p59
aVthose actually blur into a volume.
p60
aVAnd the shutter speed of the camera
p61
aVactually makes it slightly less effective in this case.
p62
aa(lp63
VBut this piece is due out in May.
p64
aVIt'll be on display at the Interactive Telecommunications Spring Show
p65
aVin Greenwich Village in New York City \u2014 that's open to the public,
p66
aVdefinitely invite you all to come and attend \u2014 it's a fantastic show.
p67
aVThere are hundreds of student innovators with fantastic projects.
p68
aVThis piece, actually, will be on display
p69
aVdown in the Sierra Simulcast Lounge
p70
aVin the breaks between now and the end of the show.
p71
aVSo I'd love to talk to you all, and invite you
p72
aVto come down and take a closer look.
p73
aVIt's an honor to be here. Thanks very much.
