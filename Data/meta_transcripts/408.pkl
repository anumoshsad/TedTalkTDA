VUnless we do something to prevent it,
p4
aVover the next 40 years we\u2019re facing an epidemic
p5
aVof neurologic diseases on a global scale.
p6
aVA cheery thought.
p7
aVOn this map, every country that\u2019s colored blue
p8
aVhas more than 20 percent of its population over the age of 65.
p9
aVThis is the world we live in.
p10
aVAnd this is the world your children will live in.
p11
aVFor 12,000 years, the distribution of ages in the human population
p12
aVhas looked like a pyramid, with the oldest on top.
p13
aVIt\u2019s already flattening out.
p14
aVBy 2050, it\u2019s going to be a column and will start to invert.
p15
aVThis is why it\u2019s happening.
p16
aVThe average lifespan\u2019s more than doubled since 1840,
p17
aVand it\u2019s increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day.
p18
aVAnd this is why that\u2019s not entirely a good thing:
p19
aVbecause over the age of 65, your risk of getting Alzheimer\u2019s
p20
aVor Parkinson\u2019s disease will increase exponentially.
p21
aVBy 2050, there\u2019ll be about 32 million people in the United States
p22
aVover the age of 80, and unless we do something about it,
p23
aVhalf of them will have Alzheimer\u2019s disease
p24
aVand three million more will have Parkinson\u2019s disease.
p25
aVRight now, those and other neurologic diseases \u2014
p26
aVfor which we have no cure or prevention \u2014
p27
aVcost about a third of a trillion dollars a year.
p28
aVIt will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050.
p29
aVAlzheimer\u2019s disease starts when a protein
p30
aVthat should be folded up properly
p31
aVmisfolds into a kind of demented origami.
p32
aVSo one approach we\u2019re taking is to try to design drugs
p33
aVthat function like molecular Scotch tape,
p34
aVto hold the protein into its proper shape.
p35
aVThat would keep it from forming the tangles
p36
aVthat seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do.
p37
aVInterestingly enough, other neurologic diseases
p38
aVwhich affect very different parts of the brain
p39
aValso show tangles of misfolded protein,
p40
aVwhich suggests that the approach might be a general one,
p41
aVand might be used to cure many neurologic diseases,
p42
aVnot just Alzheimer\u2019s disease.
p43
aVThere\u2019s also a fascinating connection to cancer here,
p44
aVbecause people with neurologic diseases
p45
aVhave a very low incidence of most cancers.
p46
aVAnd this is a connection that most people aren\u2019t pursuing right now,
p47
aVbut which we\u2019re fascinated by.
p48
aVMost of the important and all of the creative work in this area
p49
aVis being funded by private philanthropies.
p50
aVAnd there\u2019s tremendous scope for additional private help here,
p51
aVbecause the government has dropped the ball on much of this, I\u2019m afraid.
p52
aVIn the meantime, while we\u2019re waiting for all these things to happen,
p53
aVhere\u2019s what you can do for yourself.
p54
aVIf you want to lower your risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease,
p55
aVcaffeine is protective to some extent; nobody knows why.
p56
aVHead injuries are bad for you. They lead to Parkinson\u2019s disease.
p57
aVAnd the Avian Flu is also not a good idea.
p58
aVAs far as protecting yourself against Alzheimer\u2019s disease,
p59
aVwell, it turns out that fish oil has the effect
p60
aVof reducing your risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease.
p61
aVYou should also keep your blood pressure down,
p62
aVbecause chronic high blood pressure
p63
aVis the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease.
p64
aVIt\u2019s also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma,
p65
aVwhich is just Alzheimer\u2019s disease of the eye.
p66
aVAnd of course, when it comes to cognitive effects,
p67
aV"use it or lose it" applies,
p68
aVso you want to stay mentally stimulated.
p69
aVBut hey, you\u2019re listening to me.
p70
aVSo you\u2019ve got that covered.
p71
aVAnd one final thing. Wish people like me luck, okay?
p72
aVBecause the clock is ticking for all of us.
p73
aVThank you.
