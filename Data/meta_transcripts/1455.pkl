VI'm going to talk about religion.
p4
aVBut it's a broad and very delicate subject,
p5
aVso I have to limit myself.
p6
aVAnd therefore I will limit myself
p7
aVto only talk about the links between religion and sexuality.
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VThis is a very serious talk.
p12
aVSo I will talk of what I remember as the most wonderful.
p13
aVIt's when the young couple whisper,
p14
aV"Tonight we are going to make a baby."
p15
aVMy talk will be about the impact of religions
p16
aVon the number of babies per woman.
p17
aa(lp18
VThis is indeed important,
p19
aVbecause everyone understands
p20
aVthat there is some sort of limit
p21
aVon how many people we can be on this planet.
p22
aVAnd there are some people
p23
aVwho say that the world population is growing like this \u2014
p24
aVthree billion in 1960,
p25
aVseven billion just last year \u2014
p26
aVand it will continue to grow
p27
aVbecause there are religions that stop women from having few babies,
p28
aVand it may continue like this.
p29
aa(lp30
VTo what extent are these people right?
p31
aVWhen I was born there was less than one billion children in the world,
p32
aVand today, 2000, there's almost two billion.
p33
aVWhat has happened since,
p34
aVand what do the experts predict will happen
p35
aVwith the number of children during this century?
p36
aa(lp37
VThis is a quiz. What do you think?
p38
aVDo you think it will decrease to one billion?
p39
aVWill it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century?
p40
aVWill the number of children increase each year up to 15 years,
p41
aVor will it continue in the same fast rate
p42
aVand be four billion children up there?
p43
aVI will tell you by the end of my speech.
p44
aa(lp45
VBut now, what does religion have to do with it?
p46
aVWhen you want to classify religion,
p47
aVit's more difficult than you think.
p48
aVYou go to Wikipedia and the first map you find is this.
p49
aVIt divides the world into Abrahamic religions and Eastern religion,
p50
aVbut that's not detailed enough.
p51
aVSo we went on and we looked in Wikipedia, we found this map.
p52
aVBut that subdivides Christianity, Islam and Buddhism
p53
aVinto many subgroups,
p54
aVwhich was too detailed.
p55
aa(lp56
VTherefore at Gapminder we made our own map,
p57
aVand it looks like this.
p58
aVEach country's a bubble.
p59
aVThe size is the population \u2014 big China, big India here.
p60
aVAnd the color now is the majority religion.
p61
aVIt's the religion where more than 50 percent of the people
p62
aVsay that they belong.
p63
aVIt's Eastern religion in India and China and neighboring Asian countries.
p64
aVIslam is the majority religion
p65
aVall the way from the Atlantic Ocean across the Middle East,
p66
aVSouthern Europe and through Asia
p67
aVall the way to Indonesia.
p68
aVThat's where we find Islamic majority.
p69
aVAnd Christian majority religions, we see in these countries. They are blue.
p70
aVAnd that is most countries in America and Europe,
p71
aVmany countries in Africa and a few in Asia.
p72
aVThe white here are countries which cannot be classified,
p73
aVbecause one religion does not reach 50 percent
p74
aVor there is doubt about the data or there's some other reason.
p75
aVSo we were careful with that.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo bear with our simplicity now when I take you over to this shot.
p78
aVThis is in 1960.
p79
aVAnd now I show the number of babies per woman here:
p80
aVtwo, four or six \u2014
p81
aVmany babies, few babies.
p82
aVAnd here the income per person in comparable dollars.
p83
aVThe reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first
p84
aVbefore you get few babies.
p85
aVSo low income here, high income there.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd indeed in 1960,
p88
aVyou had to be a rich Christian to have few babies.
p89
aVThe exception was Japan.
p90
aVJapan here was regarded as an exception.
p91
aVOtherwise it was only Christian countries.
p92
aVBut there was also many Christian countries
p93
aVthat had six to seven babies per woman.
p94
aVBut they were in Latin America or they were in Africa.
p95
aVAnd countries with Islam as the majority religion,
p96
aVall of them almost had six to seven children per woman,
p97
aVirregardless of the income level.
p98
aVAnd all the Eastern religions except Japan had the same level.
p99
aa(lp100
VNow let's see what has happened in the world.
p101
aVI start the world, and here we go.
p102
aVNow 1962 \u2014 can you see they're getting a little richer,
p103
aVbut the number of babies per woman is falling?
p104
aVLook at China. They're falling fairly fast.
p105
aVAnd all of the Muslim majority countries across the income are coming down,
p106
aVas do the Christian majority countries in the middle income range.
p107
aVAnd when we enter into this century,
p108
aVyou'll find more than half of mankind down here.
p109
aVAnd by 2010, we are actually 80 percent of humans
p110
aVwho live in countries with about two children per woman.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Applause)
p113
aa(lp114
VIt's a quite amazing development which has happened.
p115
aV(Applause)
p116
aVAnd these are countries from United States here,
p117
aVwith $40,000 per capita,
p118
aVFrance, Russia, Iran,
p119
aVMexico, Turkey, Algeria,
p120
aVIndonesia, India
p121
aVand all the way to Bangladesh and Vietnam,
p122
aVwhich has less than five percent of the income per person of the United States
p123
aVand the same amount of babies per woman.
p124
aa(lp125
VI can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman
p126
aVis surprisingly good in all countries.
p127
aVWe get that from the census data.
p128
aVIt's not one of these statistics which is very doubtful.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo what we can conclude
p131
aVis you don't have to get rich to have few children.
p132
aVIt has happened across the world.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd then when we look at religions,
p135
aVwe can see that the Eastern religions,
p136
aVindeed there's not one single country with a majority of that religion
p137
aVthat has more than three children.
p138
aVWhereas with Islam as a majority religion and Christianity,
p139
aVyou see countries all the way.
p140
aVBut there's no major difference.
p141
aVThere's no major difference between these religions.
p142
aVThere is a difference with income.
p143
aVThe countries which have many babies per woman here,
p144
aVthey have quite low income.
p145
aVMost of them are in sub-Saharan Africa.
p146
aVBut there are also countries here
p147
aVlike Guatemala, like Papua New Guinea,
p148
aVlike Yemen and Afghanistan.
p149
aa(lp150
VMany think that Afghanistan here and Congo,
p151
aVwhich have suffered severe conflicts,
p152
aVthat they don't have fast population growth.
p153
aVIt's the other way around.
p154
aVIn the world today, it's the countries that have the highest mortality rates
p155
aVthat have the fastest population growth.
p156
aVBecause the death of a child is compensated by one more child.
p157
aVThese countries have six children per woman.
p158
aVThey have a sad death rate of one to two children per woman.
p159
aVBut 30 years from now, Afghanistan will go from 30 million to 60 million.
p160
aVCongo will go from 60 to 120.
p161
aVThat's where we have the fast population growth.
p162
aVAnd many think that these countries are stagnant, but they are not.
p163
aa(lp164
VLet me compare Senegal, a Muslim dominated country,
p165
aVwith a Christian dominated country, Ghana.
p166
aVI take them backwards here to their independence,
p167
aVwhen they were up here in the beginning of the 1960s.
p168
aVJust look what they have done.
p169
aVIt's an amazing improvement,
p170
aVfrom seven children per woman,
p171
aVthey've gone all the way down to between four and five.
p172
aVIt's a tremendous improvement.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo what does it take?
p175
aVWell we know quite well what is needed in these countries.
p176
aVYou need to have children to survive.
p177
aVYou need to get out of the deepest poverty
p178
aVso children are not of importance for work in the family.
p179
aVYou need to have access to some family planning.
p180
aVAnd you need the fourth factor, which perhaps is the most important factor.
p181
aa(lp182
VBut let me illustrate that fourth factor
p183
aVby looking at Qatar.
p184
aVHere we have Qatar today, and there we have Bangladesh today.
p185
aVIf I take these countries back to the years of their independence,
p186
aVwhich is almost the same year \u2014 '71, '72 \u2014
p187
aVit's a quite amazing development which had happened.
p188
aVLook at Bangladesh and Qatar.
p189
aVWith so different incomes, it's almost the same drop
p190
aVin number of babies per woman.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd what is the reason in Qatar?
p193
aVWell I do as I always do.
p194
aVI went to the statistical authority of Qatar, to their webpage \u2014
p195
aVIt's a very good webpage. I recommend it \u2014
p196
aVand I looked up \u2014 oh yeah, you can have lots of fun here \u2014
p197
aVand provided free of charge, I found Qatar's social trends.
p198
aVVery interesting. Lots to read.
p199
aVI found fertility at birth, and I looked at total fertility rate per woman.
p200
aVThese are the scholars and experts in the government agency in Qatar,
p201
aVand they say the most important factors are:
p202
aV"Increased age at first marriage,
p203
aVincreased educational level of Qatari woman
p204
aVand more women integrated in the labor force."
p205
aVI couldn't agree more. Science couldn't agree more.
p206
aVThis is a country that indeed has gone through
p207
aVa very, very interesting modernization.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo what it is, is these four:
p210
aVChildren should survive, children shouldn't be needed for work,
p211
aVwomen should get education and join the labor force
p212
aVand family planning should be accessible.
p213
aa(lp214
VNow look again at this.
p215
aVThe average number of children in the world
p216
aVis like in Colombia \u2014 it's 2.4 today.
p217
aVThere are countries up here which are very poor.
p218
aVAnd that's where family planning, better child survival is needed.
p219
aVI strongly recommend Melinda Gates' last TEDTalk.
p220
aVAnd here, down, there are many countries which are less than two children per woman.
p221
aVSo when I go back now to give you the answer of the quiz,
p222
aVit's two.
p223
aa(lp224
VWe have reached peak child.
p225
aVThe number of children is not growing any longer in the world.
p226
aVWe are still debating peak oil,
p227
aVbut we have definitely reached peak child.
p228
aVAnd the world population will stop growing.
p229
aVThe United Nations Population Division has said
p230
aVit will stop growing at 10 billion.
p231
aVBut why do they grow if the number of children doesn't grow?
p232
aa(lp233
VWell I will show you here.
p234
aVI will use these card boxes in which your notebooks came.
p235
aVThey are quite useful for educational purposes.
p236
aVEach card box is one billion people.
p237
aVAnd there are two billion children in the world.
p238
aVThere are two billion young people between 15 and 30.
p239
aVThese are rounded numbers.
p240
aVThen there is one billion between 30 and 45,
p241
aValmost one between 45 and 60.
p242
aVAnd then it's my box.
p243
aVThis is me: 60-plus.
p244
aVWe are here on top.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo what will happen now is what we call "the big fill-up."
p247
aVYou can see that it's like three billion missing here.
p248
aVThey are not missing because they've died; they were never born.
p249
aVBecause before 1980, there were much fewer people born
p250
aVthan there were during the last 30 years.
p251
aVSo what will happen now is quite straightforward.
p252
aVThe old, sadly, we will die.
p253
aVThe rest of you, you will grow older and you will get two billion children.
p254
aVThen the old will die.
p255
aVThe rest will grow older and get two billion children.
p256
aVAnd then again the old will die and you will get two billion children.
p257
aa(lp258
V(Applause)
p259
aa(lp260
VThis is the great fill-up.
p261
aVIt's inevitable.
p262
aVAnd can you see that this increase took place
p263
aVwithout life getting longer and without adding children?
p264
aa(lp265
VReligion has very little to do with the number of babies per woman.
p266
aVAll the religions in the world are fully capable
p267
aVto maintain their values and adapt to this new world.
p268
aa(lp269
VAnd we will be just 10 billion in this world,
p270
aVif the poorest people get out of poverty,
p271
aVtheir children survive, they get access to family planning.
p272
aVThat is needed.
p273
aVBut it's inevitable that we will be two to three billion more.
p274
aVSo when you discuss and when you plan
p275
aVfor the resources and the energy needed for the future,
p276
aVfor human beings on this planet,
p277
aVyou have to plan for 10 billion.
p278
aVThank you very much.
