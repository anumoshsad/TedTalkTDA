VMy dream is to build the world's first
p4
aVunderground park in New York City.
p5
aVNow, why would someone want to build an underground park,
p6
aVand why in New York City?
p7
aa(lp8
VThese three tough little buggers
p9
aVare, on the left, my grandmother, age five,
p10
aVand then her sister and brother,
p11
aVages 11 and nine.
p12
aVThis photo was taken just before they left
p13
aVfrom Italy to immigrate to the United States,
p14
aVjust about a century ago.
p15
aVAnd like many immigrants at the time,
p16
aVthey arrived on the Lower East Side
p17
aVin New York City
p18
aVand they encountered a crazy melting pot.
p19
aVWhat was amazing about their generation
p20
aVwas that they were not only building new lives
p21
aVin this new, unfamiliar area,
p22
aVbut they were also literally building the city.
p23
aVI've always been fascinated by those decades
p24
aVand by that history,
p25
aVand I would often beg my grandmother
p26
aVto tell me as many stories as possible
p27
aVabout the old New York.
p28
aVBut she would often just shrug it off,
p29
aVtell me to eat more meatballs, more pasta,
p30
aVand so I very rarely got
p31
aVany of the history that I wanted to hear about.
p32
aa(lp33
VThe New York City that I encountered
p34
aVfelt pretty built up.
p35
aVI always knew as a kid that I wanted
p36
aVto make a difference, and to somehow
p37
aVmake the world more beautiful, more interesting
p38
aVand more just.
p39
aVI just didn't really know how.
p40
aVAt first, I thought I wanted to go work abroad,
p41
aVso I took a job with UNICEF in Kenya.
p42
aVBut it felt weird to me that I knew more about
p43
aVlocal Kenyan politics than the politics of my own hometown.
p44
aVI took a job with the City of New York,
p45
aVbut very quickly felt frustrated
p46
aVwith the slowness of government bureaucracy.
p47
aVI even took a job at Google,
p48
aVwhere very fast I drank the Kool-Aid
p49
aVand believed almost wholeheartedly
p50
aVthat technology could solve all social problems.
p51
aVBut I still didn't feel like I was making the world a better place.
p52
aa(lp53
VIt was in 2009 that my friend
p54
aVand now business partner James Ramsey
p55
aValerted me to the location of a pretty spectacular site,
p56
aVwhich is this.
p57
aVThis is the former trolley terminal
p58
aVthat was the depot for passengers
p59
aVtraveling over the Williamsburg Bridge
p60
aVfrom Brooklyn to Manhattan,
p61
aVand it was open between 1908 and 1948,
p62
aVjust around the time when my grandparents were
p63
aVliving right in the area.
p64
aVAnd we learned also that the site
p65
aVwas entirely abandoned in 1948.
p66
aVFascinated by this discovery,
p67
aVwe begged the authorities to draw us into the space,
p68
aVand we finally got a tour,
p69
aVand this is what we saw.
p70
aVNow, this photo doesn't really do it justice.
p71
aVIt's kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical
p72
aVfeeling that you have when you get in this space.
p73
aVIt's a football field of unused land
p74
aVimmediately below a very crowded area of the city,
p75
aVand it almost feels like you're Indiana Jones
p76
aVon an archaeological dig,
p77
aVand all the details are all still there.
p78
aVIt's really pretty remarkable.
p79
aa(lp80
VNow, the site itself is located at the very heart
p81
aVof the Lower East Side,
p82
aVand today it still remains one of the most
p83
aVcrowded neighborhoods in the city.
p84
aVNew York City has two thirds the green space
p85
aVper resident as other big cities,
p86
aVand this neighborhood as one tenth the green space.
p87
aVSo we immediately started thinking about how we
p88
aVcould take this site and turn it into something
p89
aVthat could be used for the public,
p90
aVbut also could potentially even be green.
p91
aVOur plan, in a nutshell,
p92
aVis to draw natural sunlight underground
p93
aVusing a simple system that harvests sunlight above the street,
p94
aVdirects it below the city sidewalks,
p95
aVand would allow plants and trees to grow
p96
aVwith the light that's directed underneath.
p97
aVWith this approach, you could take a site
p98
aVthat looks like this today
p99
aVand transform it into something
p100
aVthat looks like this.
p101
aa(lp102
VIn 2011, we first released some of these images,
p103
aVand what was funny was,
p104
aVa lot of people said to us, "Oh, it kind of looks
p105
aVlike the High Line underground."
p106
aVAnd so what our nickname ended up becoming,
p107
aVand what ended up sticking,
p108
aVwas the Lowline, so the Lowline was born.
p109
aVWhat was also clear was that people really wanted
p110
aVto know a lot more about how the technology
p111
aVwould look and feel,
p112
aVand that there was really much more interest in this
p113
aVthan we had ever thought possible.
p114
aVSo, like a crazy person, I decided to quit my job
p115
aVand focus entirely on this project.
p116
aVHere is us with our team
p117
aVputting together a technology demonstration
p118
aVin a warehouse.
p119
aVHere's the underbelly of this solar canopy
p120
aVwhich we built to show the technology.
p121
aVYou can see the six solar collectors at the center there.
p122
aVAnd here's the full exhibit all put together
p123
aVin this warehouse.
p124
aVYou can see the solar canopy overhead,
p125
aVthe light streaming in,
p126
aVand this entirely live green space below.
p127
aVSo in the course of just a few weeks,
p128
aVtens of thousands of people came to see our exhibit,
p129
aVand since that time, we've grown
p130
aVour numbers of supporters both locally
p131
aVand among design enthusiasts all over the world.
p132
aa(lp133
VHere's a rendering of the neighborhood
p134
aVjust immediately above the Line's site,
p135
aVand a rendering of how it will look
p136
aVafter major redevelopment that is coming
p137
aVover the course of the next 10 years.
p138
aVNotice how crowded the neighborhood still feels
p139
aVand how there's really a lack of green space.
p140
aVSo what we're proposing is really something that will
p141
aVadd one football field of green space
p142
aVunderneath this neighborhood, but more importantly
p143
aVwill introduce a really community-driven focus
p144
aVin a rapidly gentrifying area.
p145
aVAnd right now, we're focusing very closely
p146
aVon how we engage with the City of New York
p147
aVon really transforming the overall ecosystem
p148
aVin an integrated way.
p149
aa(lp150
VHere's our rendering of how we would actually
p151
aVinvite people into the space itself.
p152
aVSo here you see this iconic entrance
p153
aVin which we would literally peel up the street
p154
aVand reveal the historical layers of the city,
p155
aVand invite people into this warm underground space.
p156
aVIn the middle of winter, when it's absolutely freezing outside,
p157
aVthe last place you'd want to go would be
p158
aVan outdoor space or outdoor park.
p159
aVThe Lowline would really be a four-season space
p160
aVand a respite for the city.
p161
aVSo I like to think that the Lowline actually brings
p162
aVmy own family's story full circle.
p163
aVIf my grandparents and my parents were really
p164
aVfocused on building the city up and out,
p165
aVI think my generation is focused on reclaiming
p166
aVthe spaces that we already have,
p167
aVrediscovering our shared history,
p168
aVand reimagining how we can make our communities
p169
aVmore interesting, more beautiful and more just.
