VToday I'm going to take you on a voyage
p4
aVto some place so deep,
p5
aVso dark, so unexplored
p6
aVthat we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon.
p7
aVIt's a place of myth and legend.
p8
aVIt's a place marked on ancient maps
p9
aVas "here be monsters."
p10
aVIt is a place where each new voyage of exploration
p11
aVbrings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange
p12
aVthat our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed.
p13
aVInstead, they just make me green with envy
p14
aVthat my colleague from IUCN
p15
aVwas able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts
p16
aVto actually take photographs
p17
aVand to see these wondrous creatures of the deep.
p18
aa(lp19
VWe are talking about the high seas.
p20
aVThe "high seas" is a legal term,
p21
aVbut in fact, it covers 50 percent of the planet.
p22
aVWith an average depth of the oceans
p23
aVof 4,000 meters,
p24
aVin fact, the high seas covers and provides
p25
aVnearly 90 percent of the habitat
p26
aVfor life on this Earth.
p27
aVIt is, in theory, the global commons,
p28
aVbelonging to us all.
p29
aVBut in reality,
p30
aVit is managed by and for
p31
aVthose who have the resources
p32
aVto go out and exploit it.
p33
aVSo today I'm going to take you on a voyage
p34
aVto cast light on some of the outdated myths
p35
aVand legends and assumptions
p36
aVthat have kept us as the true stakeholders
p37
aVin the high seas in the dark.
p38
aVWe're going to voyage to some of these special places
p39
aVthat we've been discovering in the past few years
p40
aVto show why we really need to care.
p41
aVAnd then finally, we're going to try
p42
aVto develop and pioneer a new perspective
p43
aVon high seas governance
p44
aVthat's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation,
p45
aVbut framed in an arena of global norms
p46
aVof precaution and respect.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo here is a picture of the high seas
p49
aVas seen from above \u2014
p50
aVthat area in the darker blue.
p51
aVTo me, as an international lawyer,
p52
aVthis scared me far more
p53
aVthan any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen,
p54
aVfor it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean,
p55
aVthe global ocean,
p56
aVthat provides us all with carbon storage,
p57
aVwith heat storage, with oxygen,
p58
aVif you can only protect 36 percent.
p59
aVThis is indeed the true heart of the planet.
p60
aVSome of the problems that we have to confront
p61
aVare that the current international laws \u2014
p62
aVfor example, shipping \u2014
p63
aVprovide more protection
p64
aVto the areas closest to shore.
p65
aVFor example, garbage discharge,
p66
aVsomething you would think just simply goes away,
p67
aVbut the laws regulating
p68
aVship discharge of garbage
p69
aVactually get weaker the further you are from shore.
p70
aVAs a result, we have garbage patches
p71
aVthe size of twice-Texas.
p72
aVIt's unbelievable.
p73
aVWe used to think the solution to pollution
p74
aVwas dilution,
p75
aVbut that has proved to be no longer the case.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo what we have learned from social scientists
p78
aVand economists like Elinor Ostrom,
p79
aVwho are studying the phenomenon
p80
aVof management of the commons on a local scale,
p81
aVis that there are certain prerequisites
p82
aVthat you can put into place
p83
aVthat enable you to manage
p84
aVand access open space
p85
aVfor the good of one and all.
p86
aVAnd these include a sense of shared responsibility,
p87
aVcommon norms that bind people together as a community.
p88
aVConditional access: You can invite people in,
p89
aVbut they have to be able to play by the rules.
p90
aVAnd of course, if you want people to play by the rules,
p91
aVyou still need an effective system
p92
aVof monitoring and enforcement,
p93
aVfor as we've discovered,
p94
aVyou can trust, but you also need to verify.
p95
aa(lp96
VWhat I'd also like to convey
p97
aVis that it is not all doom and gloom
p98
aVthat we are seeing in the high seas.
p99
aVFor a group of very dedicated individuals \u2014
p100
aVscientists, conservationists,
p101
aVphotographers and states \u2014
p102
aVwere able to actually change a tragic trajectory
p103
aVthat was destroying fragile seascapes
p104
aVsuch as this coral garden
p105
aVthat you see in front of you.
p106
aVThat is, we're able to save it from a fate
p107
aVof deep-sea bottom trawling.
p108
aVAnd how did we do that?
p109
aVWell, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships
p110
aVand actually photographed the activities in process.
p111
aVBut we also spent many hours
p112
aVin the basements of the United Nations,
p113
aVtrying to work with governments to make them understand
p114
aVwhat was going on so far away from land
p115
aVthat few of us had ever even imagined
p116
aVthat these creatures existed.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo within three years,
p119
aVfrom 2003 to 2006,
p120
aVwe were able to get norm in place
p121
aVthat actually changed the paradigm
p122
aVof how fishers went about
p123
aVdeep-sea bottom trawling.
p124
aVInstead of "go anywhere, do anything you want,"
p125
aVwe actually created a regime
p126
aVthat required prior assessment of where you're going
p127
aVand a duty to prevent significant harm.
p128
aVIn 2009, when the U.N. reviewed progress,
p129
aVthey discovered
p130
aVthat almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed
p131
aVhad been protected.
p132
aVThis does not mean that it's the final solution,
p133
aVor that this even provides permanent protection.
p134
aVBut what it does mean
p135
aVis that a group of individuals can form a community
p136
aVto actually shape
p137
aVthe way high seas are governed,
p138
aVto create a new regime.
p139
aVSo I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities
p140
aVfor creating a true, blue perspective
p141
aVfor this beautiful planet.
p142
aVSylvia's wish
p143
aVprovides us with that leverage, that access
p144
aVto the heart of human beings,
p145
aVyou might say,
p146
aVwho have rarely seen places beyond their own toes,
p147
aVbut are now hopefully going to become interested
p148
aVin the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles,
p149
aVwho indeed spend most of their time in the high seas.
p150
aa(lp151
VToday, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling
p152
aVof some of these special areas,
p153
aVjust to give you an idea of the flavor
p154
aVof the riches and wonders they do contain.
p155
aVThe Sargasso Sea, for example,
p156
aVis not a sea bounded by coastlines,
p157
aVbut it is bounded by oceanic currents
p158
aVthat contain and envelope
p159
aVthis wealth of sargassum
p160
aVthat grows and aggregates there.
p161
aVIt's also known as the spawning ground for eels
p162
aVfrom Northern European
p163
aVand Northern American rivers
p164
aVthat are now so dwindling in numbers
p165
aVthat they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm,
p166
aVand five showed up in the U.K. just recently.
p167
aa(lp168
VBut the Sargasso Sea,
p169
aVthe same way it aggregates sargassum weed,
p170
aVactually is pulling in the plastic
p171
aVfrom throughout the region.
p172
aVThis picture doesn't exactly show
p173
aVthe plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven't been out there myself.
p174
aVBut there has just been a study
p175
aVthat was released in February
p176
aVthat showed there are 200,000
p177
aVpieces of plastic per square-kilometer
p178
aVnow floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea,
p179
aVand that is affecting the habitat
p180
aVfor the many species in their juvenile stages
p181
aVwho come to the Sargasso Sea
p182
aVfor its protection and its food.
p183
aVThe Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place
p184
aVfor the aggregation of these unique species
p185
aVthat have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat.
p186
aVIt also provides a special habitat
p187
aVfor these flying fish to lay their eggs.
p188
aVBut what I'd like to get from this picture
p189
aVis that we truly do have an opportunity
p190
aVto launch a global initiative for protection.
p191
aVThus, the government of Bermuda has recognized the need
p192
aVand its responsibility
p193
aVas having some of the Sargasso Sea
p194
aVwithin its national jurisdiction \u2014
p195
aVbut the vast majority is beyond \u2014
p196
aVto help spearhead a movement
p197
aVto achieve protection for this vital area.
p198
aa(lp199
VSpinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now:
p200
aVthe Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean.
p201
aVIt's actually a bay.
p202
aVIt's considered high seas, because the continent
p203
aVhas been put off limits
p204
aVto territorial claims.
p205
aVSo anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas.
p206
aVBut what makes the Ross Sea important
p207
aVis the vast sea of pack ice
p208
aVthat in the spring and summer
p209
aVprovides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill
p210
aVthat supports what, till recently,
p211
aVhas been a virtually intact
p212
aVnear-shore ecosystem.
p213
aVBut unfortunately, CCAMLR,
p214
aVthe regional commission
p215
aVin charge of conserving and managing fish stocks
p216
aVand other living marine resources,
p217
aVis unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests
p218
aVand has authorized the expansion
p219
aVof toothfish fisheries in the region.
p220
aVThe captain of a New Zealand vessel
p221
aVwho was just down there
p222
aVis reporting a significant decline
p223
aVin the number of the Ross Sea killer whales,
p224
aVwho are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish
p225
aVas their main source of food.
p226
aVSo what we need to do is to stand up boldly,
p227
aVsingly and together,
p228
aVto push governments,
p229
aVto push regional fisheries management organizations,
p230
aVto declare our right
p231
aVto declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing,
p232
aVso that the freedom to fish no longer means
p233
aVthe freedom to fish anywhere and anytime.
p234
aa(lp235
VComing closer to here, the Costa Rica Dome
p236
aVis a recently discovered area \u2014
p237
aVpotentially year-round habitat for blue whales.
p238
aVThere's enough food there to last them
p239
aVthe summer and the winter long.
p240
aVBut what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome
p241
aVis, in fact, it's not a permanent place.
p242
aVIt's an oceanographic phenomenon
p243
aVthat shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis.
p244
aVSo, in fact, it's not permanently in the high seas.
p245
aVIt's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones
p246
aVof these five Central American countries,
p247
aVbut it moves with the season.
p248
aVAs such, it does create a challenge to protect,
p249
aVbut we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it.
p250
aVWe can use the same technologies that fishers use
p251
aVto identify where the species are,
p252
aVin order to close the area
p253
aVwhen it's most vulnerable,
p254
aVwhich may, in some cases, be year-round.
p255
aa(lp256
VGetting closer to shore, where we are,
p257
aVthis was in fact taken in the Galapagos.
p258
aVMany species are headed through this region,
p259
aVwhich is why there's been so much attention
p260
aVput into conservation
p261
aVof the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.
p262
aVThis is the initiative that's been coordinated
p263
aVby Conservation International
p264
aVwith a variety of partners and governments
p265
aVto actually try to bring integrated management regime
p266
aVthroughout the area.
p267
aVThat is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go
p268
aVwith a real regional initiative.
p269
aVIt's protecting five World Heritage sites.
p270
aVUnfortunately, the World Heritage Convention
p271
aVdoes not recognize the need to protect areas
p272
aVbeyond national jurisdiction, at present.
p273
aVSo a place like the Costa Rica Dome
p274
aVcould not technically qualify
p275
aVthe time it's in the high seas.
p276
aVSo what we've been suggesting
p277
aVis that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention,
p278
aVso that it can adopt
p279
aVand urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites,
p280
aVor we need to change the name
p281
aVand call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention.
p282
aVBut what we also know is that species like these sea turtles
p283
aVdo not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.
p284
aVThese happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre,
p285
aVwhere they spend most of their time
p286
aVand often end up getting hooked like this,
p287
aVor as bycatch.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo what I'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up.
p290
aVWe need to work locally,
p291
aVbut we also need to work ocean-basin-wide.
p292
aVWe have the tools and technologies now
p293
aVto enable us to take a broader
p294
aVocean-basin-wide initiative.
p295
aVWe've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project,
p296
aVone of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects.
p297
aVIt's provided us data like this,
p298
aVof tiny, little sooty shearwaters
p299
aVthat make the entire ocean basin their home.
p300
aVThey fly 65,000 kilometers
p301
aVin less than a year.
p302
aVSo we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life.
p303
aVAnd its culminating year
p304
aVthat's going to be launched in October.
p305
aVSo stay tuned for further information.
p306
aVWhat I find so exciting
p307
aVis that the Census of Marine Life
p308
aVhas looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators;
p309
aVit's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column,
p310
aVwhere creatures like this flying sea cucumber
p311
aVhave been found.
p312
aVAnd fortunately, we've been able, as IUCN,
p313
aVto team up with the Census of Marine Life
p314
aVand many of the scientists working there
p315
aVto actually try to translate
p316
aVmuch of this information to policymakers.
p317
aVWe have the support of governments now behind us.
p318
aVWe've been revealing this information through technical workshops.
p319
aVAnd the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information
p320
aVto move ahead to protect some of these
p321
aVsignificant hope spots, hotspots.
p322
aVAt the same time we're saying,
p323
aV"Yes, we need more. We need to move forward."
p324
aa(lp325
VBut many of you have said,
p326
aVif you get these marine protected areas,
p327
aVor a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place,
p328
aVhow are you going to enforce it?
p329
aVWhich leads me to my second passion besides ocean science,
p330
aVwhich is outer space technology.
p331
aVI wanted to be an astronaut,
p332
aVso I've constantly followed
p333
aVwhat are the tools available to monitor Earth
p334
aVfrom outer space \u2014
p335
aVand that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about,
p336
aVin terms of being able to follow tagged species
p337
aVthroughout their life-cycles
p338
aVin the open ocean.
p339
aVWe can also tag and track fishing vessels.
p340
aVMany already have transponders on board
p341
aVthat allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing.
p342
aVBut not all the vessels have those to date.
p343
aVIt does not take too much rocket science
p344
aVto actually try to create new laws to mandate,
p345
aVif you're going to have the privilege
p346
aVof accessing our high seas resources,
p347
aVwe need to know \u2014 someone needs to know \u2014
p348
aVwhere you are and what you're doing.
p349
aa(lp350
VSo it brings me to my main take-home message,
p351
aVwhich is we can avert a tragedy of the commons.
p352
aVWe can stop the collision course
p353
aVof 50 percent of the planet
p354
aVwith the high seas.
p355
aVBut we need to think broad-scale. We need to think globally.
p356
aVWe need to change how we actually go about
p357
aVmanaging these resources.
p358
aVWe need to get the new paradigm
p359
aVof precaution and respect.
p360
aVAt the same time, we need to think locally,
p361
aVwhich is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish,
p362
aVis that we can shine a spotlight
p363
aVon many of these previously unknown areas,
p364
aVand to bring people to the table, if you will,
p365
aVto actually make them feel part of this community
p366
aVthat truly has a stake
p367
aVin their future management.
p368
aVAnd third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management.
p369
aVOur species are ocean-basin-wide.
p370
aVMany of the deep-sea communities
p371
aVhave genetic distribution
p372
aVthat goes ocean-basin-wide.
p373
aVWe need to better understand,
p374
aVbut we also need to start to manage and protect.
p375
aVAnd in order to do that,
p376
aVyou also need ocean-basin management regimes.
p377
aVThat is, we have regional management regimes
p378
aVwithin the exclusive economic zone,
p379
aVbut we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity,
p380
aVso they're like the Southern Ocean,
p381
aVwhere they do have the two-pronged fisheries
p382
aVand conservation organization.
p383
aa(lp384
VSo with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor
p385
aVSylvia Earle for her wish,
p386
aVfor it is helping us to put a face on the high seas
p387
aVand the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction.
p388
aVIt's helping to bring an incredible group
p389
aVof talented people together
p390
aVto really try to solve and penetrate
p391
aVthese problems that have created our obstacles
p392
aVto management and rational use
p393
aVof this area that was once so far away and remote.
p394
aa(lp395
VSo on this tour, I hope I provided you
p396
aVwith a new perspective of the high seas:
p397
aVone, that it is our home too,
p398
aVand that we need to work together
p399
aVif we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all.
p400
aa(lp401
VThank you.
