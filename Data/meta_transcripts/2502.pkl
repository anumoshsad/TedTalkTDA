VI've got a confession.
p4
aVI love looking through people's garbage.
p5
aVNow, it's not some creepy thing.
p6
aVI'm usually just looking for old electronics,
p7
aVstuff I can take to my workshop and hack.
p8
aVI do have a fetish for CD-ROM drives.
p9
aVEach one's got three different motors,
p10
aVso now you can build things that move.
p11
aVThere's switches so you can turn things on and off.
p12
aVThere's even a freaking laser,
p13
aVso you can make a cool robot into an awesome robot.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, I've built a lot of stuff out of garbage,
p16
aVand some of these things have even been kind of useful.
p17
aVBut here's the thing,
p18
aVfor me, garbage is just a chance to play,
p19
aVto be creative and build things to amuse myself.
p20
aVThis is what I love doing, so I just made it part of my day job.
p21
aVI lead a university-based biological research lab,
p22
aVwhere we value curiosity and exploration above all else.
p23
aVWe aren't focused on any particular problem,
p24
aVand we're not trying to solve any particular disease.
p25
aVThis is just a place where people can come
p26
aVand ask fascinating questions and find answers.
p27
aVAnd I realized a long time ago
p28
aVthat if I challenge people to build the equipment they need
p29
aVout of the garbage I find,
p30
aVit's a great way to foster creativity.
p31
aVAnd what happened
p32
aVwas that artists and scientists from around the world
p33
aVstarted coming to my lab.
p34
aVAnd it's not just because we value unconventional ideas,
p35
aVit's because we test and validate them
p36
aVwith scientific rigor.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo one day I was hacking something, I was taking it apart,
p39
aVand I had this sudden idea:
p40
aVCould I treat biology like hardware?
p41
aVCould I dismantle a biological system,
p42
aVmix and match the parts
p43
aVand then put it back together in some new and creative way?
p44
aVMy lab started working on this,
p45
aVand I want to show you the result.
p46
aa(lp47
VCan any of you guys tell me what fruit this is?
p48
aa(lp49
VAudience: Apple!
p50
aa(lp51
VAndrew Pelling: That's right \u2014 it's an apple.
p52
aVNow, I actually want you to notice as well
p53
aVthat this is a lot redder than most apples.
p54
aVAnd that's because we grew human cells into it.
p55
aVWe took a totally innocent Macintosh apple,
p56
aVremoved all the apple cells and DNA
p57
aVand then implanted human cells.
p58
aVAnd what we're left with after removing all the apple cells
p59
aVis this cellulose scaffold.
p60
aVThis is the stuff that gives plants their shape and texture.
p61
aVAnd these little holes that you can see,
p62
aVthis is where all the apple cells used to be.
p63
aVSo then we come along,
p64
aVwe implant some mammalian cells that you can see in blue.
p65
aVWhat happens is, these guys start multiplying
p66
aVand they fill up this entire scaffold.
p67
aa(lp68
VAs weird as this is,
p69
aVit's actually really reminiscent of how our own tissues are organized.
p70
aVAnd we found in our pre-clinical work
p71
aVthat you can implant these scaffolds into the body,
p72
aVand the body will send in cells and a blood supply
p73
aVand actually keep these things alive.
p74
aVThis is the point when people started asking me,
p75
aV"Andrew, can you make body parts out of apples?"
p76
aVAnd I'm like, "You've come to the right place."
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VI actually brought this up with my wife.
p81
aVShe's a musical instrument maker,
p82
aVand she does a lot of wood carving for a living.
p83
aVSo I asked her,
p84
aV"Could you, like, literally carve some ears
p85
aVout of an apple for us?"
p86
aVAnd she did.
p87
aVSo I took her ears to the lab.
p88
aVWe then started preparing them.
p89
aVYeah, I know.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VIt's a good lab, man.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd then we grew cells on them.
p98
aVAnd this is the result.
p99
aa(lp100
VListen, my lab is not in the ear-manufacturing business.
p101
aVPeople have actually been working on this for decades.
p102
aVHere's the issue:
p103
aVcommercial scaffolds can be really expensive and problematic,
p104
aVbecause they're sourced from proprietary products,
p105
aVanimals or cadavers.
p106
aVWe used an apple and it cost pennies.
p107
aa(lp108
VWhat's also really cool here
p109
aVis it's not that hard to make these things.
p110
aVThe equipment you need can be built from garbage,
p111
aVand the key processing step only requires soap and water.
p112
aVSo what we did was put all the instructions online as open source.
p113
aVAnd then we founded a mission-driven company,
p114
aVand we're developing kits to make it easier
p115
aVfor anyone with a sink and a soldering iron
p116
aVto make these things at home.
p117
aVWhat I'm really curious about is if one day,
p118
aVit will be possible to repair, rebuild and augment our own bodies
p119
aVwith stuff we make in the kitchen.
p120
aa(lp121
VSpeaking of kitchens,
p122
aVhere's some asparagus.
p123
aVThey're tasty, and they make your pee smell funny.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VNow, I was in my kitchen, and I was noticing
p128
aVthat when you look down the stalks of these asparagus,
p129
aVwhat you can see are all these tiny little vessels.
p130
aVAnd when we image them in the lab,
p131
aVyou can see how the cellulose forms these structures.
p132
aVThis image reminds me of two things:
p133
aVour blood vessels
p134
aVand the structure and organization of our nerves and spinal cord.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo here's the question:
p137
aVCan we grow axons and neurons down these channels?
p138
aVBecause if we can,
p139
aVthen maybe we can use asparagus to form new connections
p140
aVbetween the ends of damaged and severed nerves.
p141
aVOr maybe even a spinal cord.
p142
aVDon't get me wrong \u2014
p143
aVthis is exceptionally challenging
p144
aVand really hard work to do,
p145
aVand we are not the only ones working on this.
p146
aVBut we are the only ones using asparagus.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VRight now, we've got really promising pilot data.
p151
aVAnd we're working with tissue engineers
p152
aVand neurosurgeons
p153
aVto find out what's actually possible.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo listen, all of the work I've shown you,
p156
aVthe stuff that I've built that's all around me on this stage
p157
aVand the other projects my lab is involved in
p158
aVare all a direct result of me playing with your garbage.
p159
aVPlay \u2014 play is a key part of my scientific practice.
p160
aVIt's how I train my mind to be unconventional and to be creative
p161
aVand to decide to make human apple ears.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo, the next time any of you are looking at some old,
p164
aVbroken-down, malfunctioning, piece-of-crap technology,
p165
aVI want you to think of me.
p166
aVBecause I want it.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VSeriously, please find any way to get in touch with me,
p171
aVand let's see what we can build.
p172
aa(lp173
VThank you.
