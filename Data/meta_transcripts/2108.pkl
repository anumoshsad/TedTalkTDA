VSo imagine that a plane is about to crash
p4
aVwith 250 children and babies,
p5
aVand if you knew how to stop that, would you?
p6
aa(lp7
VNow imagine
p8
aVthat 60 planes full of babies under five
p9
aVcrash every single day.
p10
aVThat's the number of kids
p11
aVthat never make it to their fifth birthday.
p12
aV6.6 million children
p13
aVnever make it to their fifth birthday.
p14
aa(lp15
VMost of these deaths are preventable,
p16
aVand that doesn't just make me sad,
p17
aVit makes me angry,
p18
aVand it makes me determined.
p19
aVDiarrhea and pneumonia
p20
aVare among the top two killers
p21
aVof children under five,
p22
aVand what we can do to prevent these diseases
p23
aVisn't some smart,
p24
aVnew technological innovations.
p25
aVIt's one of the world's oldest inventions:
p26
aVa bar of soap.
p27
aVWashing hands with soap,
p28
aVa habit we all take for granted,
p29
aVcan reduce diarrhea by half,
p30
aVcan reduce respiratory infections by one third.
p31
aVHandwashing with soap
p32
aVcan have an impact
p33
aVon reducing flu, trachoma, SARS,
p34
aVand most recently in the case of cholera
p35
aVand Ebola outbreak,
p36
aVone of the key interventions
p37
aVis handwashing with soap.
p38
aVHandwashing with soap keeps kids in school.
p39
aVIt stops babies from dying.
p40
aVHandwashing with soap
p41
aVis one of the most cost-effective
p42
aVways of saving children's lives.
p43
aVIt can save over 600,000 children every year.
p44
aVThat's the equivalent of stopping
p45
aV10 jumbo jets
p46
aVfull of babies and children
p47
aVfrom crashing every single day.
p48
aVI think you'll agree with me that that's a pretty
p49
aVuseful public health intervention.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo now just take a minute.
p52
aVI think you need to get to know the person next to you.
p53
aVWhy don't you just shake their hands.
p54
aVPlease shake their hands.
p55
aVAll right, get to know each other.
p56
aVThey look really pretty.
p57
aVAll right.
p58
aVSo what if I told you
p59
aVthat the person whose hands you just shook
p60
aVactually didn't wash their hands
p61
aVwhen they were coming out of the toilet? (Laughter)
p62
aVThey don't look so pretty anymore, right?
p63
aVPretty yucky, you would agree with me.
p64
aa(lp65
VWell, statistics are actually showing
p66
aVthat four people out of five
p67
aVdon't wash their hands when they come out of the toilet,
p68
aVglobally.
p69
aVAnd the same way,
p70
aVwe don't do it when we've got fancy toilets,
p71
aVrunning water, and soap available,
p72
aVit's the same thing in the countries
p73
aVwhere child mortality is really high.
p74
aa(lp75
VWhat is it? Is there no soap?
p76
aVActually, soap is available.
p77
aVIn 90 percent of households in India,
p78
aV94 percent of households in Kenya,
p79
aVyou will find soap.
p80
aVEven in countries where soap is the lowest,
p81
aVlike Ethiopia, we are at 50 percent.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo why is it?
p84
aVWhy aren't people washing their hands?
p85
aVWhy is it that Mayank,
p86
aVthis young boy that I met in India,
p87
aVisn't washing his hands?
p88
aVWell, in Mayank's family,
p89
aVsoap is used for bathing,
p90
aVsoap is used for laundry,
p91
aVsoap is used for washing dishes.
p92
aVHis parents think sometimes
p93
aVit's a precious commodity,
p94
aVso they'll keep it in a cupboard.
p95
aVThey'll keep it away from him so he doesn't waste it.
p96
aVOn average, in Mayank's family,
p97
aVthey will use soap for washing hands
p98
aVonce a day
p99
aVat the very best, and sometimes
p100
aVeven once a week for washing hands with soap.
p101
aVWhat's the result of that?
p102
aVChildren pick up disease
p103
aVin the place that's supposed to love them
p104
aVand protect them the most, in their homes.
p105
aa(lp106
VThink about where you learned to wash your hands.
p107
aVDid you learn to wash your hands at home?
p108
aVDid you learn to wash your hands in school?
p109
aVI think behavioral scientists will tell you
p110
aVthat it's very difficult to change the habits
p111
aVthat you have had early in life.
p112
aa(lp113
VHowever, we all copy what everyone else does,
p114
aVand local cultural norms are something
p115
aVthat shape how we change our behavior,
p116
aVand this is where the private sector comes in.
p117
aVEvery second in Asia and Africa,
p118
aV111 mothers
p119
aVwill buy this bar to protect their family.
p120
aVMany women in India will tell you
p121
aVthey learned all about hygiene, diseases,
p122
aVfrom this bar of soap from Lifebuoy brand.
p123
aVIconic brands like this one
p124
aVhave a responsibility to do good
p125
aVin the places where they sell their products.
p126
aVIt's that belief, plus the scale of Unilever,
p127
aVthat allows us to keep talking about
p128
aVhandwashing with soap and hygiene to these mothers.
p129
aa(lp130
VBig businesses and brands can change
p131
aVand shift those social norms
p132
aVand make a difference for those habits
p133
aVthat are so stubborn.
p134
aVThink about it:
p135
aVMarketeers spend all their time
p136
aVmaking us switch from one brand to the other.
p137
aVAnd actually, they know how to transform
p138
aVscience and facts into compelling messages.
p139
aVJust for a minute, imagine
p140
aVwhen they put all their forces behind
p141
aVa message as powerful as handwashing with soap.
p142
aVThe profit motive is transforming health outcomes
p143
aVin this world.
p144
aa(lp145
VBut it's been happening for centuries:
p146
aVthe Lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894
p147
aVin Victorian England
p148
aVto actually combat cholera.
p149
aVLast week, I was in Ghana
p150
aVwith the minister of health,
p151
aVbecause if you don't know,
p152
aVthere's a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment.
p153
aVA hundred and eighteen years later,
p154
aVthe solution is exactly the same:
p155
aVIt's about ensuring that they have access
p156
aVto this bar of soap,
p157
aVand that they're using it,
p158
aVbecause that's the number one way
p159
aVto actually stop cholera from spreading.
p160
aVI think this drive for profit
p161
aVis extremely powerful,
p162
aVsometimes more powerful than
p163
aVthe most committed charity or government.
p164
aa(lp165
VGovernment is doing what they can,
p166
aVespecially in terms of the pandemics
p167
aVand epidemics such as cholera,
p168
aVor Ebola at the moment,
p169
aVbut with competing priorities.
p170
aVThe budget is not always there.
p171
aVAnd when you think about this,
p172
aVyou think about what is required
p173
aVto make handwashing a daily habit,
p174
aVit requires sustained funding
p175
aVto refine this behavior.
p176
aVIn short, those that fight for public health
p177
aVare actually dependent upon the soap companies
p178
aVto keep promoting handwashing with soap.
p179
aVWe have friends like USAID,
p180
aVthe Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap,
p181
aVLondon School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,
p182
aVPlan, WaterAid,
p183
aVthat all believe
p184
aVfor a win-win-win partnership.
p185
aVWin for the public sector,
p186
aVbecause we help them reach their targets.
p187
aVWin for the private sector,
p188
aVbecause we build new generations
p189
aVof future handwashers.
p190
aVAnd most importantly,
p191
aVwin for the most vulnerable.
p192
aVOn October 15,
p193
aVwe will celebrate Global Handwashing Day.
p194
aVSchools, communities,
p195
aVour friends in the public sector
p196
aVand our friends in the private sector \u2014
p197
aVyes, on that day even our competitors,
p198
aVwe all join hands to celebrate
p199
aVthe world's most important
p200
aVpublic health intervention.
p201
aVWhat's required,
p202
aVand again where the private sector can make a huge difference,
p203
aVis coming up with this big, creative thinking
p204
aVthat drives advocacy.
p205
aVIf you take our Help a Child Reach 5 campaign,
p206
aVwe've created great films
p207
aVthat bring the message of handwashing with soap
p208
aVto the everyday person
p209
aVin a way that can relate to them.
p210
aVWe've had over 30 million views.
p211
aVMost of these discussions are still happening online.
p212
aVI urge you to take five minutes
p213
aVand look at those films.
p214
aa(lp215
VI come from Mali,
p216
aVone of the world's poorest countries.
p217
aVI grew up in a family where every dinner conversation
p218
aVwas around social justice.
p219
aVI trained in Europe's premier school of public health.
p220
aVI think I'm probably one of the only women
p221
aVin my country with this high degree in health,
p222
aVand the only one
p223
aVwith a doctorate in handwashing with soap.
p224
aV(Laughter)
p225
aV(Applause)
p226
aa(lp227
VNine years ago, I decided,
p228
aVwith a successful public health career in the making,
p229
aVthat I could make the biggest impact coming,
p230
aVselling and promoting the world's best invention
p231
aVin public health: soap.
p232
aVWe run today the world's largest
p233
aVhandwashing program
p234
aVby any public health standards.
p235
aVWe've reached over 183 million people
p236
aVin 16 countries.
p237
aVMy team and I have the ambition
p238
aVto reach one billion by 2020.
p239
aVOver the last four years,
p240
aVbusiness has grown double digits,
p241
aVwhilst child mortality has reduced
p242
aVin all the places where soap use has increased.
p243
aVIt may be uncomfortable for some to hear \u2014
p244
aVbusiness growth and lives saved
p245
aVsomehow equated in the same sentence \u2014
p246
aVbut it is that business growth
p247
aVthat allows us to keep doing more.
p248
aVWithout it, and without talking about it,
p249
aVwe cannot achieve the change that we need.
p250
aa(lp251
VLast week, my team and I
p252
aVspent time visiting mothers
p253
aVthat have all experienced the same thing:
p254
aVthe death of a newborn.
p255
aVI'm a mom. I can't imagine anything more powerful
p256
aVand more painful.
p257
aVThis one is from Myanmar.
p258
aVShe had the most beautiful smile,
p259
aVthe smile, I think, that life gives you
p260
aVwhen you've had a second chance.
p261
aVHer son, Myo, is her second one.
p262
aVShe had a daughter
p263
aVwho passed away at three weeks,
p264
aVand we know that the majority
p265
aVof children that actually die
p266
aVdie in the first month of their life,
p267
aVand we know that if we give a bar of soap
p268
aVto every skilled birth attendant,
p269
aVand that if soap is used  before touching the babies,
p270
aVwe can reduce and make a change
p271
aVin terms of those numbers.
p272
aVAnd that's what inspires me,
p273
aVinspires me to continue in this mission,
p274
aVto know that I can equip her
p275
aVwith what's needed
p276
aVso that she can do
p277
aVthe most beautiful job in the world:
p278
aVnurturing her newborn.
p279
aVAnd next time you think of a gift
p280
aVfor a new mom and her family,
p281
aVdon't look far: buy her soap.
p282
aVIt's the most beautiful invention in public health.
p283
aa(lp284
VI hope you will join us
p285
aVand make handwashing part of your daily lives
p286
aVand our daily lives
p287
aVand help more children like Myo
p288
aVreach their fifth birthday.
