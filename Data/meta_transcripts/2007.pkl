VWhat do augmented reality
p4
aVand professional football
p5
aVhave to do with empathy?
p6
aVAnd what is the air speed velocity
p7
aVof an unladen swallow?
p8
aVNow unfortunately, I'm only going to answer
p9
aVone of those questions today,
p10
aVso please, try and contain your disappointment.
p11
aa(lp12
VWhen most people think about augmented reality,
p13
aVthey think about "Minority Report" and Tom Cruise
p14
aVwaving his hands in the air,
p15
aVbut augmented reality is not science fiction.
p16
aVAugmented reality is something that will happen
p17
aVin our lifetime, and it will happen
p18
aVbecause we have the tools to make it happen,
p19
aVand people need to be aware of that,
p20
aVbecause augmented reality will change our lives
p21
aVjust as much as the Internet and the cell phone.
p22
aa(lp23
VNow how do we get to augmented reality?
p24
aVStep one is the step I'm wearing right now,
p25
aVGoogle Glass.
p26
aVI'm sure many of you are familiar with Google Glass.
p27
aVWhat you may not be familiar with
p28
aVis that Google Glass is a device
p29
aVthat will allow you to see what I see.
p30
aVIt will allow you to experience what it is like
p31
aVto be a professional athlete on the field.
p32
aVRight now, the only way you can be on the field
p33
aVis for me to try and describe it to you.
p34
aVI have to use words.
p35
aVI have to create a framework that you then fill in
p36
aVwith your imagination.
p37
aVWith Google Glass, we can put that
p38
aVunderneath a helmet,
p39
aVand we can get a sense of what it's like
p40
aVto be running down the field at 100 miles an hour,
p41
aVyour blood pounding in your ears.
p42
aVYou can get a sense of what it's like
p43
aVto have a 250-pound man
p44
aVsprinting at you
p45
aVtrying to decapitate you
p46
aVwith every ounce of his being.
p47
aVAnd I've been on the receiving end of that,
p48
aVand it doesn't feel very good.
p49
aa(lp50
VNow, I have some footage to show you of what it's like
p51
aVto wear Google Glass underneath the helmet
p52
aVto give you a taste of that.
p53
aVUnfortunately, it's not NFL practice footage
p54
aVbecause the NFL thinks emergent technology
p55
aVis what happens when a submarine surfaces,
p56
aVbut \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 we do what we can.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo let's pull up some video.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Video) Chris Kluwe: Go.
p61
aVUgh, getting tackled sucks.
p62
aVHold on, let's get a little closer.
p63
aVAll right, ready?
p64
aVGo!
p65
aa(lp66
VChris Kluwe: So as you can see,
p67
aVsmall taste of what it's like to get tackled
p68
aVon the football field
p69
aVfrom the perspective of the tacklee.
p70
aVNow, you may have noticed there are
p71
aVsome people missing there:
p72
aVthe rest of the team.
p73
aVWe have some video of that
p74
aVcourtesy of the University of Washington.
p75
aa(lp76
V(Video) Quarterback: Hey, Mice 54! Mice 54!
p77
aVBlue 8! Blue 8! Go!
p78
aVOh!
p79
aa(lp80
VCK: So again, this takes you a little bit closer
p81
aVto what it's like to be on that field,
p82
aVbut this is nowhere what it's like
p83
aVto be on the NFL.
p84
aa(lp85
VFans want that experience.
p86
aVFans want to be on that field.
p87
aVThey want to be their favorite players,
p88
aVand they've already talked to me on YouTube,
p89
aVthey've talked to me on Twitter, saying,
p90
aV"Hey, can you get this on a quarterback?
p91
aVCan you get this on a running back?
p92
aVWe want that experience."
p93
aa(lp94
VWell, once we have that experience with GoPro
p95
aVand Google Glass,
p96
aVhow do we make it more immersive?
p97
aVHow do we take that next step?
p98
aVWell, we take that step
p99
aVby going to something called the Oculus Rift,
p100
aVwhich I'm sure many of you are also familiar with.
p101
aVThe Oculus Rift has been described as one of
p102
aVthe most realistic virtual reality devices ever created,
p103
aVand that is not empty hype.
p104
aVI'm going to show you why that is not empty hype
p105
aVwith this video.
p106
aV(Video) Man: Oh! Oh!
p107
aVNo! No! No! I don't want to play anymore! No!
p108
aVOh my God! Aaaah!
p109
aa(lp110
VCK: So that is the experience of a man
p111
aVon a roller coaster
p112
aVin fear of his life.
p113
aVWhat do you think that fan's experience
p114
aVis going to be when we take the video footage
p115
aVof an Adrian Peterson bursting through the line,
p116
aVshedding a tackler with a stiff-arm
p117
aVbefore sprinting in for a touchdown?
p118
aVWhat do you think that fan's experience
p119
aVis going to be when he's Messi
p120
aVsprinting down the pitch
p121
aVputting the ball in the back of the net,
p122
aVor Federer serving in Wimbledon?
p123
aVWhat do you think his experience is going to be
p124
aVwhen he is going down the side of a mountain
p125
aVat over 70 miles an hour
p126
aVas an Olympic downhill skier?
p127
aVI think adult diaper sales may surge.
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VBut this is not yet augmented reality.
p131
aVThis is only virtual reality, V.R.
p132
aVHow do we get to augmented reality, A.R.?
p133
aVWe get to augmented reality
p134
aVwhen coaches and managers and owners
p135
aVlook at this information streaming in
p136
aVthat people want to see, and they say,
p137
aV"How do we use this to make our teams better?
p138
aVHow do we use this to win games?"
p139
aVBecause teams always use technology to win games.
p140
aVThey like winning. It makes them money.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo a brief history of technology in the NFL.
p143
aVIn 1965, the Baltimore Colts
p144
aVput a wristband on their quarterback
p145
aVto allow him to call plays quicker.
p146
aVThey ended up winning a Super Bowl that year.
p147
aVOther teams followed suit.
p148
aVMore people watched the game because it was more exciting.
p149
aVIt was faster.
p150
aa(lp151
VIn 1994, the NFL put helmet radios
p152
aVinto the helmets of the quarterbacks,
p153
aVand later the defense.
p154
aVMore people watched games because it was faster.
p155
aVIt was more entertaining.
p156
aa(lp157
VIn 2023, imagine you're a player
p158
aVwalking back to the huddle,
p159
aVand you have your next play displayed
p160
aVright in front of your face on your clear plastic visor
p161
aVthat you already wear right now.
p162
aVNo more having to worry about forgetting plays.
p163
aVNo more worrying about having to memorize your playbook.
p164
aVYou just go out and react.
p165
aVAnd coaches really want this,
p166
aVbecause missed assignments lose you games,
p167
aVand coaches hate losing games.
p168
aVLosing games gets you fired as a coach.
p169
aVThey don't want that.
p170
aa(lp171
VBut augmented reality is not just
p172
aVan enhanced playbook.
p173
aVAugmented reality is also a way to take all that data
p174
aVand use it in real time
p175
aVto enhance how you play the game.
p176
aVWhat would that be like?
p177
aVWell, a very simple setup would be a camera
p178
aVon each corner of the stadium looking down,
p179
aVgiving you a bird's-eye view
p180
aVof all the people down there.
p181
aVYou also have information from helmet sensors
p182
aVand accelerometers,
p183
aVtechnology that's being worked on right now.
p184
aVYou take all that information, and you stream it to your players.
p185
aVThe good teams stream it in a way that the players can use.
p186
aVThe bad ones have information overload.
p187
aVThat determines good teams from bad.
p188
aVAnd now, your I.T. department
p189
aVis just as important as your scouting department,
p190
aVand data-mining is not for nerds anymore.
p191
aVIt's also for jocks. Who knew?
p192
aa(lp193
VWhat would that look like on the field?
p194
aVWell, imagine you're the quarterback.
p195
aVYou take the snap and you drop back.
p196
aVYou're scanning downfield for an open receiver.
p197
aVAll of a sudden, a bright flash
p198
aVon the left side of your visor lets you know,
p199
aVblind side linebacker is blitzing in.
p200
aVNormally, you wouldn't be able to see him,
p201
aVbut the augmented reality system lets you know.
p202
aVYou step up into the pocket.
p203
aVAnother flash alerts you to an open receiver.
p204
aVYou throw the ball, but you're hit right as you throw.
p205
aVThe ball comes off track.
p206
aVYou don't know where it's going to land.
p207
aVHowever, on the receiver's visor,
p208
aVhe sees a patch of grass light up,
p209
aVand he knows to readjust.
p210
aVHe goes, catches the ball,
p211
aVsprints in, touchdown.
p212
aVCrowd goes wild, and the fans are with him
p213
aVevery step of the way,
p214
aVwatching from every perspective.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow this is something that will create
p217
aVmassive excitement in the game.
p218
aVIt will make tons of people watch,
p219
aVbecause people want this experience.
p220
aVFans want to be on the field.
p221
aVThey want to be their favorite player.
p222
aVAugmented reality will be a part of sports,
p223
aVbecause it's too profitable not to.
p224
aa(lp225
VBut the question I ask you is,
p226
aVis that's all that we're content to use augmented reality for?
p227
aVAre we going to use it solely for our panem,
p228
aVour circenses, our entertainment as normal?
p229
aVBecause I believe that we can use augmented reality
p230
aVfor something more.
p231
aVI believe we can use augmented reality
p232
aVas a way to foster more empathy
p233
aVwithin the human species itself,
p234
aVby literally showing someone
p235
aVwhat it looks like
p236
aVto walk a mile in another person's shoes.
p237
aVWe know what this technology is worth
p238
aVto sports leagues.
p239
aVIt's worth revenue, to the tune of billions of dollars a year.
p240
aVBut what is this technology worth
p241
aVto a teacher in a classroom
p242
aVtrying to show a bully
p243
aVjust how harmful his actions are
p244
aVfrom the perspective of the victim?
p245
aVWhat is this technology worth
p246
aVto a gay Ugandan or Russian
p247
aVtrying to show the world what it's like
p248
aVliving under persecution?
p249
aVWhat is this technology worth
p250
aVto a Commander Hadfield or a Neil deGrasse Tyson
p251
aVtrying to inspire a generation of children
p252
aVto think more about space and science
p253
aVinstead of quarterly reports and Kardashians?
p254
aa(lp255
VLadies and gentlemen, augmented reality
p256
aVis coming.
p257
aVThe questions we ask, the choices we make,
p258
aVand the challenges we face
p259
aVare, as always, up to us.
p260
aa(lp261
VThank you.
