VI moved back home 15 years ago
p4
aVafter a 20-year stay in the United States,
p5
aVand Africa called me back.
p6
aVAnd I founded my country's first
p7
aVgraphic design and new media college.
p8
aVAnd I called it the Zimbabwe Institute of Vigital Arts.
p9
aVThe idea, the dream, was really for a sort of Bauhaus
p10
aVsort of school where new ideas were interrogated
p11
aVand investigated,
p12
aVthe creation of a new visual language
p13
aVbased on the African creative heritage.
p14
aVWe offer a two-year diploma
p15
aVto talented students who have successfully completed
p16
aVtheir high school education.
p17
aVAnd typography's a very important part of the curriculum
p18
aVand we encourage our students to look inward for influence.
p19
aVHere's a poster designed by one of the students
p20
aVunder the theme "Education is a right."
p21
aVSome logos designed by my students.
p22
aVAfrica has had a long tradition of writing,
p23
aVbut this is not such a well-known fact,
p24
aVand I wrote the book "Afrikan Alphabets" to address that.
p25
aVThe different types of writing in Africa,
p26
aVfirst was proto-writing,
p27
aVas illustrated by Nsibidi,
p28
aVwhich is the writing system of a secret society
p29
aVof the Ejagham people in southern Nigeria.
p30
aVSo it's a special-interest writing system.
p31
aVThe Akan of people of Ghana and [Cote d'Ivoire]
p32
aVdeveloped Adinkra symbols some 400 years ago,
p33
aVand these are proverbs, historical sayings,
p34
aVobjects, animals, plants,
p35
aVand my favorite Adinkra system
p36
aVis the first one at the top on the left.
p37
aVIt's called Sankofa.
p38
aVIt means, "Return and get it." Learn from the past.
p39
aVThis pictograph by the Jokwe people of Angola
p40
aVtells the story of the creation of the world.
p41
aVAt the top is God, at the bottom is man, mankind,
p42
aVand on the left is the sun, on the right is the moon.
p43
aVAll the paths lead to and from God.
p44
aVThese secret societies of the Yoruba, Kongo
p45
aVand Palo religions
p46
aVin Nigeria, Congo and Angola respectively,
p47
aVdeveloped this intricate writing system
p48
aVwhich is alive and well today in the New World
p49
aVin Cuba, Brazil and Trinidad and Haiti.
p50
aVIn the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of Congo,
p51
aVin the Ituri society,
p52
aVthe men pound out a cloth out of a special tree,
p53
aVand the women, who are also the praise singers,
p54
aVpaint interweaving patterns
p55
aVthat are the same in structure
p56
aVas the polyphonic structures that they use in their singing \u2014
p57
aVa sort of a musical score, if you may.
p58
aVIn South Africa, Ndebele women
p59
aVuse these symbols and other geometric patterns
p60
aVto paint their homes in bright colors,
p61
aVand the Zulu women use the symbols
p62
aVin the beads that they weave
p63
aVinto bracelets and necklaces.
p64
aVEthiopia has had the longest tradition of writing,
p65
aVwith the Ethiopic script that was developed
p66
aVin the fourth century A.D.
p67
aVand is used to write Amharic,
p68
aVwhich is spoken by over 24 million people.
p69
aVKing Ibrahim Njoya of the Bamum Kingdom of Cameroon
p70
aVdeveloped Shü-mom at the age of 25.
p71
aVShü-mom is a writing system.
p72
aVIt's a syllabary. It's not exactly an alphabet.
p73
aVAnd here we see three stages of development
p74
aVthat it went through in 30 years.
p75
aVThe Vai people of Liberia had a long tradition of literacy
p76
aVbefore their first contact with Europeans in the 1800s.
p77
aVIt's a syllabary and reads from left to right.
p78
aVNext door, in Sierra Leone, the Mende
p79
aValso developed a syllabary,
p80
aVbut theirs reads from right to left.
p81
aVAfrica has had a long tradition of design,
p82
aVa well-defined design sensibility,
p83
aVbut the problem in Africa has been that,
p84
aVespecially today, designers in Africa
p85
aVstruggle with all forms of design
p86
aVbecause they are more apt to look outward
p87
aVfor influence and inspiration.
p88
aVThe creative spirit in Africa, the creative tradition,
p89
aVis as potent as it has always been,
p90
aVif only designers could look within.
p91
aVThis Ethiopic cross illustrates
p92
aVwhat Dr. Ron Eglash has established:
p93
aVthat Africa has a lot to contribute to computing
p94
aVand mathematics through their intuitive grasp of fractals.
p95
aVAfricans of antiquity created civilization,
p96
aVand their monuments, which still stand today,
p97
aVare a true testimony of their greatness.
p98
aVMost probably, one of humanity's greatest achievements
p99
aVis the invention of the alphabet,
p100
aVand that has been attributed to Mesopotamia
p101
aVwith their invention of cuneiform in 1600 BC,
p102
aVfollowed by hieroglyphics in Egypt,
p103
aVand that story has been cast in stone as historical fact.
p104
aVThat is, until 1998,
p105
aVwhen one Yale professor John Coleman Darnell
p106
aVdiscovered these inscriptions in the Thebes desert
p107
aVon the limestone cliffs in western Egypt,
p108
aVand these have been dated at between 1800 and 1900 B.C.,
p109
aVcenturies before Mesopotamia.
p110
aVCalled Wadi el-Hol
p111
aVbecause of the place that they were discovered,
p112
aVthese inscriptions \u2014 research is still going on,
p113
aVa few of them have been deciphered,
p114
aVbut there is consensus among scholars
p115
aVthat this is really humanity's first alphabet.
p116
aVOver here, you see a paleographic chart
p117
aVthat shows what has been deciphered so far,
p118
aVstarting with the letter A, "\u0101lep," at the top,
p119
aVand "bêt," in the middle, and so forth.
p120
aVIt is time that students of design in Africa
p121
aVread the works of titans like Cheikh Anta Diop,
p122
aVSenegal's Cheikh Anta Diop,
p123
aVwhose seminal work on Egypt is vindicated
p124
aVby this discovery.
p125
aVThe last word goes to the great Jamaican leader
p126
aVMarcus Mosiah Garvey
p127
aVand the Akan people of Ghana
p128
aVwith their Adinkra symbol Sankofa,
p129
aVwhich encourages us to go to the past
p130
aVso as to inform our present
p131
aVand build on a future for us and our children.
p132
aVIt is also time that designers in Africa
p133
aVstop looking outside.
p134
aVThey've been looking outward for a long time,
p135
aVyet what they were looking for
p136
aVhas been right there within grasp, right within them.
p137
aVThank you very much.
