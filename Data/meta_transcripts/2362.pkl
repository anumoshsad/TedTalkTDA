VA girl I've never met before
p4
aVchanged my life and the life of thousands of other people.
p5
aVI'm the CEO of DoSomething.org.
p6
aVIt's one of the largest organizations in the world for young people.
p7
aVIn fact it's bigger than the Boy Scouts in the United States.
p8
aVAnd we're not homophobic.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd it's true \u2014 the way we communicate with young people is by text,
p13
aVbecause that's how young people communicate.
p14
aVSo we'll run over 200 campaigns this year,
p15
aVthings like collecting peanut butter for food pantries,
p16
aVor making Valentine's Day cards for senior citizens who are homebound.
p17
aVAnd we'll text them.
p18
aVAnd we'll have a 97 percent open rate.
p19
aVIt'll over-index Hispanic and urban.
p20
aVWe collected 200,000 jars of peanut butter
p21
aVand over 365,000 Valentine's Day cards.
p22
aVThis is big scale. OK \u2014
p23
aa(lp24
V(Applause)
p25
aa(lp26
VBut there's one weird side effect.
p27
aVEvery time we send out a text message,
p28
aVwe get back a few dozen text messages having nothing to do with peanut butter
p29
aVor hunger or senior citizens \u2014
p30
aVbut text messages about being bullied,
p31
aVtext messages about being addicted to pot.
p32
aVAnd the worst message we ever got said exactly this:
p33
aV"He won't stop raping me.
p34
aVIt's my dad.
p35
aVHe told me not to tell anyone. Are you there?"
p36
aa(lp37
VWe couldn't believe this was happening.
p38
aVWe couldn't believe that something so horrific could happen to a human being,
p39
aVand that she would share it with us \u2014 something so intimate, so personal.
p40
aVAnd we realized we had to stop triaging this
p41
aVand we had to build a crisis text line for these people in pain.
p42
aVSo we launched Crisis Text Line,
p43
aVvery quietly, in Chicago and El Paso \u2014 just a few thousand people in each market.
p44
aVAnd in four months, we were in all 295 area codes in America.
p45
aVJust to put that into perspective,
p46
aVthat's zero marketing and faster growth than when Facebook first launched.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Applause)
p49
aa(lp50
VText is unbelievably private.
p51
aVNo one hears you talking.
p52
aVSo we spike everyday at lunch time \u2014
p53
aVkids are sitting at the lunch table
p54
aVand you think that she's texting the cute boy across the hall,
p55
aVbut she's actually texting us about her bulimia.
p56
aVAnd we don't get the word "like" or "um" or hyperventilating or crying.
p57
aVWe just get facts.
p58
aa(lp59
VWe get things like, "I want to die.
p60
aVI have a bottle of pills on the desk in front of me."
p61
aVAnd so the crisis counselor says,
p62
aV"How about you put those pills in the drawer while we text?"
p63
aVAnd they go back and forth for a while.
p64
aVAnd the crisis counselor gets the girl to give her her address,
p65
aVbecause if you're texting a text line, you want help.
p66
aVSo she gets the address
p67
aVand the counselor triggers an active rescue
p68
aVwhile they're texting back and forth.
p69
aVAnd then it goes quiet \u2014
p70
aV23 minutes with no response from this girl.
p71
aVAnd the next message that comes in says \u2014
p72
aVit's the mom \u2014
p73
aV"I had no idea, and I was in the house,
p74
aVwe're in an ambulance on our way to the hospital."
p75
aVAs a mom that one just \u2014
p76
aVThe next message comes a month later.
p77
aV"I just got out of the hospital.
p78
aVI was diagnosed as bipolar, and I think I'm going to be OK."
p79
aa(lp80
V(Applause)
p81
aa(lp82
VI would love to tell you that that's an unusual exchange,
p83
aVbut we're doing on average 2.41 active rescues a day.
p84
aVThirty percent of our text messages are about suicide and depression \u2014 huge.
p85
aVThe beautiful thing about Crisis Text Line
p86
aVis that these are strangers counseling other strangers
p87
aVon the most intimate issues,
p88
aVand getting them from hot moments to cold moments.
p89
aVIt's exciting, and I will tell you
p90
aVthat we have done a total of more than 6.5 million text messages
p91
aVin less than two years.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Applause)
p94
aa(lp95
VBut the thing that really gets me hot and sweaty about this,
p96
aVthe thing that really gets me psyched is the data:
p97
aV6.5 million messages \u2014
p98
aVthat's the volume, velocity and variety to provide a really juicy corpus.
p99
aVWe can do things like predictive work.
p100
aVWe can do all kinds of conclusions and learnings from that data set.
p101
aVSo we can be better, and the world can be better.
p102
aVSo how do we use the data to make us better?
p103
aVAlright, chances are someone here, someone watching this
p104
aVhas seen a therapist or a shrink at some point in time in your life \u2014
p105
aVyou do not have to raise your hand.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VHow do you know that person's any good?
p110
aVOh, they have a degree from Harvard on the wall?
p111
aVAre you sure he didn't graduate in the bottom 10 percent?
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VWhen my husband and I saw a marriage counselor,
p116
aVI thought she was a genius when she said,
p117
aV"I'll see you guys in two weeks \u2014 but I need to see you next week, sir."
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VWe have the data to know what makes a great counselor.
p122
aVWe know that if you text the words "numbs" and "sleeve,"
p123
aVthere's a 99 percent match for cutting.
p124
aVWe know that if you text in the words "mg" and "rubber band,"
p125
aVthere's a 99 percent match for substance abuse.
p126
aVAnd we know that if you text in "sex," "oral" and "Mormon,"
p127
aVyou're questioning if you're gay.
p128
aVNow that's interesting information that a counselor could figure out
p129
aVbut that algorithm in our hands means that an automatic pop-up says,
p130
aV"99 percent match for cutting \u2014 try asking one of these questions"
p131
aVto prompt the counselor.
p132
aVOr "99 percent match for substance abuse,
p133
aVhere are three drug clinics near the texter."
p134
aVIt makes us more accurate.
p135
aa(lp136
VOn the day that Robin Williams committed suicide,
p137
aVpeople flooded hotlines all over this country.
p138
aVIt was sad to see an icon, a funnyman, commit suicide,
p139
aVand there were three hour wait times on every phone hotline in the country.
p140
aVWe had a spike in volume also.
p141
aVThe difference was
p142
aVif you text us, "I want to die," or "I want to kill myself,"
p143
aVthe algorithm reads that, you're code orange,
p144
aVand you become number one in the queue.
p145
aVSo we can handle severity, not chronological.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Applause)
p148
aa(lp149
VThis data is also making the world better
p150
aVbecause I'm sitting on the world's first map of real-time crises.
p151
aVThink about it:
p152
aVthose 6.5 million messages, auto-tagging through natural language processes,
p153
aVall of these data points \u2014
p154
aVI can tell you that the worst day of the week for eating disorders: Monday.
p155
aVThe worst time of day for substance abuse: 5am.
p156
aVAnd that Montana is a beautiful place to visit
p157
aVbut you do not want to live there,
p158
aVbecause it is the number one state for suicidal ideation.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd we've made this data public and free and open.
p161
aVWe've pulled all the personally identifiable information.
p162
aVAnd it's in a place called CrisisTrends.org.
p163
aVBecause I want schools to be able to see
p164
aVthat Monday is the worst day for eating disorders,
p165
aVso that they can plan meals
p166
aVand guidance counselors to be there on Mondays.
p167
aVAnd I want families to see that substance abuse questions spike at 5am.
p168
aVI want somebody to take care of those Native American reservations in Montana.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Applause)
p171
aa(lp172
VData, evidence
p173
aVmakes policy, research,
p174
aVjournalism, policing, school boards \u2014 everything better.
p175
aVI don't think of myself as a mental health activist.
p176
aVI think of myself as a national health activist.
p177
aVI get really excited about this data, I'm a little nerdy.
p178
aVYeah, that sounded too girly.
p179
aVI'm nerdy.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VI love data.
p184
aVAnd the only difference really between me and those people in hoodies down the road
p185
aVwith their fat-funded companies,
p186
aVis that I'm not inspired by helping you find Chinese food at 2am in Dallas,
p187
aVor helping you touch your wrist and get a car immediately,
p188
aVor swipe right and get laid.
p189
aVI'm inspired \u2014
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter, applause)
p192
aa(lp193
VI want to use tech and data to make the world a better place.
p194
aVI want to use it to help that girl,
p195
aVwho texted in about  being raped by her father.
p196
aVBecause the truth is we never heard from her again.
p197
aVAnd I hope that she is somewhere safe and healthy,
p198
aVand I hope that she sees this talk
p199
aVand she knows that her desperation
p200
aVand her courage inspired the creation of Crisis Text Line
p201
aVand inspires me every freaking day.
