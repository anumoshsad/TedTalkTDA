VI'm Rich Baraniuk and what I'd like to talk a little bit about today
p4
aVare some ideas that I think have just tremendous resonance
p5
aVwith all the things that have been talked about the last two days.
p6
aVSo many different points of resonance
p7
aVthat it's going to be difficult to bring them all up,
p8
aVbut I'll try to do my best.
p9
aVDoes anybody remember these?
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VOK, so these are LP records and they've been replaced, right?
p14
aVThey've been swept away over the last two decades
p15
aVby these types of world-flattening digitization technologies, right?
p16
aVAnd I think it was best witnessed
p17
aVwhen Thomas was playing the music as we came in the room today.
p18
aVWhat's happened in the music world is there's a culture,
p19
aVor an ecosystem that's been created
p20
aVthat, if you take some words from Apple,
p21
aVthe catchphrase \u2014 that we create, rip, mix and burn.
p22
aVWhat I mean by that is that anyone in the world is free and allowed
p23
aVto create new music and musical ideas.
p24
aVAnyone in the world is allowed to rip or copy musical ideas,
p25
aVuse them in innovative ways.
p26
aVAnyone is allowed to mix them in different types of ways,
p27
aVdraw connections between musical ideas,
p28
aVand people can burn them or create final products and continue the circle.
p29
aVAnd what that's done is it's created, like I said,
p30
aVa vibrant community that's very inclusive,
p31
aVwith people continually working to connect musical ideas,
p32
aVinnovate them and keep things constantly up to date.
p33
aVToday's hit single is not last year's hit single.
p34
aa(lp35
VBut I'm not here to talk about music today.
p36
aVI'm here to talk about books.
p37
aVIn particular, textbooks and the kind of educational materials
p38
aVthat we use every day in school.
p39
aVHas anyone here ever been to school?
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VOK, does anybody realize there's a crisis in our schools,
p44
aVaround the world?
p45
aVI'm not going to spend too much time on that,
p46
aVbut what I want to talk about is some of the disconnects
p47
aVthat appear when an author publishes a book.
p48
aVThat in fact, the publishing process \u2014
p49
aVjust because of the fact that it's complicated,
p50
aVit's heavy, books are expensive \u2014
p51
aVcreates a sort of a wall between authors of books
p52
aVand the ultimate users of books,
p53
aVbe they teachers, students or just general readers.
p54
aVAnd this is even more true if you happen to speak a language
p55
aVother than one of the world's major languages, and especially English.
p56
aVI'm going to call these people below the barrier "shutouts"
p57
aVbecause they're really shut out of the process
p58
aVof being able to share their knowledge with the world.
p59
aVAnd so what I want to talk about today is trying to take these ideas
p60
aVthat we've seen in the musical culture
p61
aVand try to bring these towards reinventing the way
p62
aVwe think about writing books, using them and teaching from them.
p63
aVSo, that's what I'd like to talk about
p64
aVand, really, how we get from where we are now
p65
aVto where we need to go.
p66
aa(lp67
VThe first thing I'd like you to do is a little thought experiment.
p68
aVImagine taking all the world's books.
p69
aVOK, everybody imagine books and imagine just tearing out the pages.
p70
aVSo, liberating these pages
p71
aVand imagine digitizing them and then storing them
p72
aVin a vast, interconnected, global repository.
p73
aVThink of it as a massive iTunes for book-type content.
p74
aVAnd then take that material and imagine making it all open,
p75
aVso that people can modify it, play with it, improve it.
p76
aVImagine making it free,
p77
aVso that anyone in the world can have access to all of this knowledge,
p78
aVand imagine using information technology
p79
aVso that you can update this content, improve it, play with it,
p80
aVon a timescale that's more on the order of seconds instead of years.
p81
aVInstead of editions of a book coming out every two years,
p82
aVimagine them coming out every 25 seconds.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo, imagine we could do that and imagine we could put people into this.
p85
aVSo that we could truly build an ecosystem with not just authors,
p86
aVbut all the people who could be or want to be authors
p87
aVin all the different languages of the world,
p88
aVand I think if you could do this, it would be called \u2014
p89
aVI'm just going to refer to it as a knowledge ecosystem.
p90
aVSo, really, this is the dream,
p91
aVand in a sense what you can think of it
p92
aVis we're trying to enable anyone in the world,
p93
aVI mean anyone in the world \u2014
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
Vto be their own educational DJ,
p98
aVcreating educational materials, sharing them with the world,
p99
aVconstantly innovating on them.
p100
aVSo, this is the dream.
p101
aa(lp102
VIn fact, this dream is actually being realized.
p103
aVOver the last six-and-a-half years,
p104
aVwe've been working really hard at Rice University
p105
aVon a project called Connexions,
p106
aVand so what I'd like to do for the rest of the talk
p107
aVis just tell you a little bit
p108
aVabout what people are doing with Connexions,
p109
aVwhich you can kind of think of as the counterpoint
p110
aVto Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday,
p111
aVwhere they're working on the hardware of bringing education to the world.
p112
aVWe're working on the open-source tools
p113
aVand the content.
p114
aVSo, that's sort of to put it in perspective here.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo, create.
p117
aVWhat are some of the people that are using these kind of tools?
p118
aVWell, the first thing is,
p119
aVthere's a community of engineering professors,
p120
aVfrom Cambridge to Kyoto,
p121
aVwho are developing engineering content in electrical engineering
p122
aVto develop what you can think of as a massive, super textbook
p123
aVthat covers the entire area of electrical engineering.
p124
aVAnd not only that \u2014
p125
aVit can be customized for use in each of their own individual institutions.
p126
aVIf people like Kitty Jones, a shut-out \u2014
p127
aVa private music teacher and mom from Champagne, Illinois,
p128
aVwho wanted to share her fantastic music content with the world,
p129
aVon how to teach kids how to play music \u2014
p130
aVHer material is now used over 600,000 times per month.
p131
aVTremendous use.
p132
aVIn fact, a lot of this use coming from United States K-12 schools,
p133
aVbecause anyone who's involved in a school scale back,
p134
aVthe first thing that's cut is the music curriculum.
p135
aVAnd so this is just indicating the tremendous thirst
p136
aVfor this kind of open, free content.
p137
aVA lot of teachers are using this stuff.
p138
aa(lp139
VWhat about ripping? What about copying, reusing?
p140
aVA team of volunteers at the University of Texas at El Paso \u2014
p141
aVgraduate students translating this engineering super textbook ideas.
p142
aVAnd within about a week,
p143
aVhaving this be some of our most popular material
p144
aVin widespread use all over Latin America, and in particular in Mexico,
p145
aVbecause of the open, extensible nature of this.
p146
aVPeople, volunteers and even companies
p147
aVthat are translating materials into Asian languages
p148
aVlike Chinese, Japanese and Thai,
p149
aVto spread the knowledge even further.
p150
aa(lp151
VOK, what about people who are mixing?
p152
aVWhat does "mixing" mean?
p153
aV"Mixing" means building customized courses,
p154
aVmeans building customized books.
p155
aVCompanies like National Instruments,
p156
aVwho are embedding very powerful, interactive simulations
p157
aVinto the materials,
p158
aVso that we can go way beyond our regular kind of textbook
p159
aVto an experience
p160
aVthat all the teaching materials are things you can actually interact with
p161
aVand play around with and actually learn as you do.
p162
aa(lp163
VWe've been working with Teachers Without Borders,
p164
aVwho are very interested in mixing our materials.
p165
aVThey're going to be using Connexions as their platform
p166
aVto develop and deliver teaching materials for teaching teachers how to teach
p167
aVin 84 countries around the world.
p168
aVTWB is currently in Iraq,
p169
aVtraining 20,000 teachers supported by USAID.
p170
aVAnd to them, this idea of being able to remix
p171
aVand customize to the local context is extraordinarily important,
p172
aVbecause just providing free content to people
p173
aVhas actually been likened by people in the developing world
p174
aVto a kind of cultural imperialism \u2014
p175
aVthat if you don't empower people
p176
aVwith the ability to re-contextualize the material,
p177
aVtranslate it into their own language and take ownership of it,
p178
aVit's not good.
p179
aa(lp180
VOK, other organizations we've been working with, UC Merced \u2014
p181
aVpeople know about UC Merced.
p182
aVIt's a new university in California, in the Central Valley,
p183
aVworking very closely with community colleges.
p184
aVThey're actually developing
p185
aVa lot of their science and engineering curriculum
p186
aVto spread widely around the world in our system.
p187
aVAnd they're also trying to develop all of their software tools
p188
aVcompletely open-source.
p189
aVWe've been working with AMD, which has a project called 50x15,
p190
aVwhich is trying to bring Internet connectivity
p191
aVto 50 percent of the world's population by 2015.
p192
aVWe're going to be providing content to them
p193
aVin a whole range of different languages.
p194
aVAnd we've also been working with a number of other organizations.
p195
aVIn particular, a bunch of the projects that are funded by Hewlett Foundation,
p196
aVwho have taken a real leadership role in this area of open content.
p197
aa(lp198
VOK, burn \u2014 I think this is, sort of, quite interesting.
p199
aV"Burn" is the idea of trying to create the physical instantiation
p200
aVof one of these courses.
p201
aVAnd I think a lot of you received \u2014
p202
aVI think all of you received one of these music books in your gift pack.
p203
aVA little present for you.
p204
aVJust to tell you quickly about it: this is an engineering textbook.
p205
aVIt's about 300 pages long, hardbound.
p206
aVThis costs \u2014 anybody guess?
p207
aVHow much would it cost in a bookstore?
p208
aa(lp209
V(Audience) 65 dollars.
p210
aa(lp211
VRichard Baraniuk: OK. This costs 22 dollars to the student.
p212
aVWhy does it cost 22 dollars?
p213
aVBecause it's published on demand
p214
aVand it's developed from this repository of open materials.
p215
aVIf this book were to be published by a regular publisher,
p216
aVit would cost at least 122 dollars.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo what we're seeing
p219
aVis moving this burning or publication process
p220
aVfrom the regular, sort of single-authored book
p221
aVtowards community-authored materials
p222
aVthat are modular, that are customized to each individual class
p223
aVand published on demand very inexpensively,
p224
aVeither pushed out through Amazon
p225
aVor published directly through an on-demand press, like QOOP.
p226
aVAnd I think that this is an extraordinarily interesting area
p227
aVbecause there is tremendous area under this long tail in publishing.
p228
aVWe're not talking about the Harry Potter end,
p229
aVright at the left side.
p230
aVWe're talking about books
p231
aVon hypergeometric partial differential equations.
p232
aVBooks that might sell 100 copies a year, 1,000 copies a year.
p233
aVThere is tremendous sustaining revenue under this long tail
p234
aVto sustain open projects like ours,
p235
aVbut also to sustain this new emergence of on-demand publishers,
p236
aVlike QOOP, who produced these two books.
p237
aVAnd I think one of the things that you should take away from this talk
p238
aVis that there's an impending cut-out-the-middle-man disintermediation,
p239
aVthat's going to be happening in the publishing industry.
p240
aVAnd it's going to reach a crescendo over the next few years,
p241
aVand I think that it's for our benefit, really, and for the world's benefit.
p242
aa(lp243
VOK, so what are the enablers?
p244
aVWhat's really making all of this happen?
p245
aVThere's tons of technology,
p246
aVand the only piece of technology that I really want to talk about is XML.
p247
aVHow many people know about XML?
p248
aVOh, great.
p249
aVSo it's the future of the web, right?
p250
aVIt's semantic representation of content.
p251
aVAnd what you can really think of XML in this case
p252
aVis it's the packaging that we're putting around these pages.
p253
aVRemember we took the book, tore the pages out?
p254
aVWell, what the XML is going to do
p255
aVis it's going to turn those pages into Lego blocks.
p256
aVXML are the nubs on the Lego
p257
aVthat allow us to combine the content together in a myriad different ways,
p258
aVand it provides us a framework to share content.
p259
aVSo, it lets you take this ecosystem
p260
aVin its primordial state of all this content,
p261
aVall the pages you've torn out of books,
p262
aVand create highly sophisticated learning machines:
p263
aVbooks, courses, course packs.
p264
aa(lp265
VIt gives you the ability to personalize the learning experience
p266
aVto each individual student,
p267
aVso that every student can have a book or a course
p268
aVthat's customized to their learning style, their context,
p269
aVtheir language and the things that excite them.
p270
aVIt lets you reuse the same materials in multiple different ways,
p271
aVand surprising new ways.
p272
aVIt lets you interconnect ideas,
p273
aVindicating how fields relate to each other.
p274
aVAnd I'll just give you my personal story.
p275
aVWe came up with this six-and-a-half years ago
p276
aVbecause I teach the stuff in the red box.
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd my day job, as Chris said \u2014 I'm an electrical engineering professor.
p279
aVI teach signal processing
p280
aVand my challenge was to show that this math \u2014
p281
aVWow, about half of you have already fallen asleep
p282
aVjust looking at the equation.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
VBut this seemingly dry math
p287
aVis actually the center of this tremendously powerful web
p288
aVthat links technology \u2014
p289
aVthat links really cool applications like music synthesizers
p290
aVto tremendous economic opportunities,
p291
aVbut also governed by intellectual property.
p292
aVAnd the thing that I realized
p293
aVis there was no way that I, as an engineer,
p294
aVcould write this book that would get all of this across.
p295
aVWe needed a community to do it
p296
aVand we needed new tools to be able to interconnect these ideas.
p297
aVAnd I think that really, in a sense, what we're trying to do
p298
aVis make Minsky's dream come to a reality,
p299
aVwhere you can imagine all the books in a library
p300
aVactually starting to talk to each other.
p301
aVAnd people who are teachers out here \u2014 whoever taught, you know this \u2014
p302
aVit's the interconnections between ideas that teaching is really all about.
p303
aa(lp304
VOK, back to math.
p305
aVImagine \u2014 this is possible:
p306
aVthat every single equation that you click on in one of your new e-texts
p307
aVis something that you're going to be able to explore and experiment with.
p308
aVSo imagine your kid's algebra textbook in seventh grade.
p309
aVYou can click on every single equation
p310
aVand bring up a little tool to be able to experiment with it,
p311
aVtinker with it, understand it.
p312
aVBecause we really don't understand until we do.
p313
aVThe same type of mark-up, like MathML, for chemistry.
p314
aVImagine chemistry textbooks
p315
aVthat actually understand the structure of how molecules are formed.
p316
aVImagine Music XML
p317
aVthat actually lets you delve into the semantic structure of music,
p318
aVplay with it, understand it.
p319
aVIt's no wonder that everybody's getting into it, right?
p320
aVEven the three wise men.
p321
aa(lp322
V(Laughter)
p323
aa(lp324
VOK, the second big enabler, and this is where I told a big lie.
p325
aVThe second big enabler is intellectual property.
p326
aVBecause, in fact, I got up here
p327
aVand I talked about how great the music culture is.
p328
aVWe can share and rip, mix and burn, but in fact, that's all illegal.
p329
aVAnd we would be accused of [piracy] for doing that,
p330
aVbecause this music has been propertized.
p331
aVIt's now owned, much of it by big industries.
p332
aVSo, really, the key thing here is we can't let this happen.
p333
aVWe can't let this Napster thing happen here.
p334
aVSo, what we have to do is get it right from the very beginning.
p335
aVAnd what we have to do is find an intellectual property framework
p336
aVthat makes sharing safe and makes it easily understandable.
p337
aVAnd the inspiration here is taken from open-source software.
p338
aVThings like Linux and the GPL.
p339
aa(lp340
VThe Creative Commons licenses.
p341
aVHow many people have heard of creative commons?
p342
aVIf you have not, you must learn about it.
p343
aVCreativecommons.org.
p344
aVAt the bottom of every piece of material in Connexions
p345
aVand in lots of other projects,
p346
aVyou can find their logo.
p347
aVClicking on that logo takes you to an absolute no-nonsense,
p348
aVhuman-readable document, a deed,
p349
aVthat tells you exactly what you can do with this content.
p350
aVIn fact, you're free to share it, to do all of these things:
p351
aVto copy it, to change it, even to make commercial use of it,
p352
aVas long as you attribute the author.
p353
aVBecause in academic publishing and much of educational publishing,
p354
aVit's really this idea of sharing knowledge
p355
aVand making impact.
p356
aVThat's why people write, not necessarily making bucks.
p357
aVWe're not talking about Harry Potter, right?
p358
aVWe're at the long tail end here.
p359
aVBehind that is the legal code, very carefully constructed.
p360
aa(lp361
VAnd Creative Commons is taking off \u2014
p362
aVover 43 million things out there,
p363
aVlicensed with a Creative Commons license.
p364
aVNot just text,
p365
aVbut music, images, video.
p366
aVAnd there's actually a tremendous uptake
p367
aVof the number of people that are actually licensing music
p368
aVto make it free for people who do this whole idea of re-sampling,
p369
aVripping, mixing, burning and sharing.
p370
aa(lp371
VOK, I'd like to conclude with just the last few points.
p372
aVSo, we've built this idea of a commons.
p373
aVPeople are using it.
p374
aVWe get over 500,000 unique visitors per month, just to our particular site.
p375
aVMIT OpenCourseWare, which is another large open-content site,
p376
aVgets a similar number of hits.
p377
aVBut how do we protect this?
p378
aVHow do we protect it into the future?
p379
aVAnd the first thing that people are probably thinking
p380
aVis quality control, right?
p381
aVBecause we're saying that anybody can contribute things to this commons.
p382
aVAnybody can contribute anything.
p383
aVSo that could be a problem.
p384
aa(lp385
VIt didn't take long until people started contributing materials,
p386
aVfor example, on lingerie,
p387
aVwhich is actually a pretty good module.
p388
aVThe only problem is it's plagiarized from a major French feminist journal,
p389
aVand when you go to the supposed course website,
p390
aVit points to a lingerie-selling website.
p391
aVSo this is a little bit of a problem.
p392
aVSo we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control
p393
aVand this is really where the idea of review and peer review comes in.
p394
aVYou come to TED. Why do you come to TED?
p395
aVBecause Chris and his team have ensured
p396
aVthat things are very, very high quality, right?
p397
aVAnd so we need to be able to do the same thing.
p398
aVAnd we need to be able to design structures,
p399
aVand what we're doing is designing social software
p400
aVto enable anyone to build their own peer review process,
p401
aVand we call these things "lenses."
p402
aVAnd basically what they allow
p403
aVis anyone out there can develop their own peer-review process,
p404
aVso that they can focus on the content in the repository
p405
aVthat they think is really important.
p406
aVAnd you can think of TED as a potential lens.
p407
aa(lp408
VSo I'd just like to end by saying:
p409
aVyou can really view this as a call to action.
p410
aVConnexions and open content is all about sharing knowledge.
p411
aVAll of you here are tremendously imbued with tremendous amounts of knowledge,
p412
aVand what I'd like to do is invite each and every one of you
p413
aVto contribute to this project and other projects of its type,
p414
aVbecause I think together we can truly change the landscape
p415
aVof education and educational publishing.
p416
aa(lp417
VSo, thanks very much.
