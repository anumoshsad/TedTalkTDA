VThe first half of the 20th century
p4
aVwas an absolute disaster in human affairs,
p5
aVa cataclysm.
p6
aVWe had the First World War,
p7
aVthe Great Depression,
p8
aVthe Second World War
p9
aVand the rise of the communist nations.
p10
aVAnd each one of these forces
p11
aVsplit the world, tore the world apart,
p12
aVdivided the world.
p13
aVAnd they threw up walls \u2014
p14
aVpolitical walls, trade walls,
p15
aVtransportation walls,
p16
aVcommunication walls, iron curtains \u2014
p17
aVwhich divided peoples and nations.
p18
aa(lp19
VIt was only in the second half of the 20th century
p20
aVthat we slowly began to pull ourselves
p21
aVout of this abyss.
p22
aVTrade walls began to come tumbling down.
p23
aVHere are some data on tariffs:
p24
aVstarting at 40 percent, coming down to less than 5 percent.
p25
aVWe globalized the world. And what does that mean?
p26
aVIt means that we extended cooperation
p27
aVacross national boundaries;
p28
aVwe made the world more cooperative.
p29
aVTransportation walls came tumbling down.
p30
aVYou know in 1950 the typical ship carried
p31
aV5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods.
p32
aVToday a container ship can carry 150,000 tons;
p33
aVit can be manned with a smaller crew;
p34
aVand unloaded faster than ever before.
p35
aVCommunication walls, I don't have to tell you \u2014 the Internet \u2014
p36
aVhave come tumbling down.
p37
aVAnd of course the iron curtains,
p38
aVpolitical walls have come tumbling down.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow all of this has been tremendous for the world.
p41
aVTrade has increased.
p42
aVHere is just a little bit of data.
p43
aVIn 1990, exports from China to the United States:
p44
aV15 billion dollars.
p45
aVBy 2007: over 300 billion dollars.
p46
aVAnd perhaps most remarkably,
p47
aVat the beginning of the 21st century,
p48
aVreally for the first time in modern history,
p49
aVgrowth extended to almost all parts of the world.
p50
aVSo China, I've already mentioned,
p51
aVbeginning around 1978, around the time of the death of Mao,
p52
aVgrowth \u2014 ten percent a year.
p53
aVYear after year after year,
p54
aVabsolutely incredible.
p55
aVNever before in human history
p56
aVhave so many people been raised out of
p57
aVsuch great poverty as happened in China.
p58
aVChina is the world's greatest anti-poverty program
p59
aVover the last three decades.
p60
aVIndia, starting a little bit later,
p61
aVbut in 1990, begetting tremendous growth.
p62
aVIncomes at that time
p63
aVless than $1,000 per year.
p64
aVAnd over the next 18 years
p65
aVhave almost tripled.
p66
aVGrowth of six percent a year. Absolutely incredible.
p67
aVNow Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa \u2014
p68
aVSub-Saharan Africa
p69
aVhas been the area of the world
p70
aVmost resistant to growth.
p71
aVAnd we can see the tragedy of Africa
p72
aVin the first few bars here.
p73
aVGrowth was negative.
p74
aVPeople were actually getting poorer than their parents,
p75
aVand sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been.
p76
aVBut at the end of the 20th century,
p77
aVthe beginning of the 21st century,
p78
aVwe saw growth in Africa.
p79
aVAnd I think, as you'll see, there's reasons for optimism,
p80
aVbecause I believe that the best is yet to come.
p81
aVNow why.
p82
aa(lp83
VOn the cutting edge today
p84
aVit's new ideas which are driving growth.
p85
aVAnd by that I mean it's
p86
aVproducts for which the research and development costs
p87
aVare really high, and the manufacturing costs are low.
p88
aVMore than ever before it is these types of ideas
p89
aVwhich are driving growth on the cutting edge.
p90
aVNow ideas have this amazing property.
p91
aVThomas Jefferson, I think, really expressed this quite well.
p92
aVHe said, "He who receives an idea from me
p93
aVreceives instruction himself, without lessening mine.
p94
aVAs he who lights his candle at mine
p95
aVreceives light without darkening me."
p96
aVOr to put it slightly differently:
p97
aVone apple feeds one man,
p98
aVbut an idea can feed the world.
p99
aVNow this is not new. This is practically not new to TEDsters.
p100
aVThis is practically the model of TED.
p101
aVBut what is new is that the greater function of ideas
p102
aVis going to drive growth even more than ever before.
p103
aVThis provides a reason why
p104
aVtrade and globalization
p105
aVare even more important, more powerful than ever before,
p106
aVand are going to increase growth more than ever before.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd to explain why this is so, I have a question.
p109
aVSuppose that there are two diseases:
p110
aVone of them is rare, the other one is common,
p111
aVbut if they are not treated they are equally severe.
p112
aVIf you had to choose, which would you rather have:
p113
aVthe common disease or the rare disease?
p114
aVCommon, the common \u2014 I think that's absolutely right,
p115
aVand why? Because there are more drugs to treat common diseases
p116
aVthan there are to treat rare diseases.
p117
aVThe reason for this is incentives.
p118
aVIt costs about the same to produce a new drug
p119
aVwhether that drug treats 1,000 people,
p120
aV100,000 people, or a million people.
p121
aVBut the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people.
p122
aVSo the incentives are much larger
p123
aVto produce drugs which treat more people.
p124
aVTo put this differently: larger markets save lives.
p125
aVIn this case misery truly does love company.
p126
aa(lp127
VNow think about the following:
p128
aVif China and India were as rich as the United States is today,
p129
aVthe market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now.
p130
aVNow we are not there yet, but it is happening.
p131
aVAs other countries become richer
p132
aVthe demand for these pharmaceuticals
p133
aVis going to increase tremendously.
p134
aVAnd that means an increase incentive to do research and development,
p135
aVwhich benefits everyone in the world.
p136
aVLarger markets increase the incentive
p137
aVto produce all kinds of ideas,
p138
aVwhether it's software, whether it's a computer chip,
p139
aVwhether it's a new design.
p140
aVFor the Hollywood people in the audience,
p141
aVthis even explains why action movies
p142
aVhave larger budgets than comedies:
p143
aVit's because action movies translate easier
p144
aVinto other languages and other cultures,
p145
aVso the market for those movies is larger.
p146
aVPeople are willing to invest more,
p147
aVand the budgets are larger.
p148
aa(lp149
VAlright. Well if larger markets increase the incentive
p150
aVto produce new ideas,
p151
aVhow do we maximize that incentive?
p152
aVIt's by having one world market, by globalizing the world.
p153
aVThe way I like to put this is:
p154
aVone idea. Ideas are meant to be shared,
p155
aVso one idea can serve one world, one market.
p156
aVOne idea, one world, one market.
p157
aVWell how else can we create new ideas?
p158
aVThat's one reason.
p159
aVGlobalize trade.
p160
aVHow else can we create new ideas?
p161
aVWell, more idea creators.
p162
aVNow idea creators, they come from all walks of life.
p163
aVArtists and innovators \u2014 many of the people you've seen on this stage.
p164
aVI'm going to focus on scientists and engineers
p165
aVbecause I have some data on that, and I'm a data person.
p166
aa(lp167
VNow, today, less than one-tenth of one percent
p168
aVof the world's population are scientists and engineers.
p169
aV(Laughter)
p170
aVThe United States has been an idea leader.
p171
aVA large fraction of those people are in the United States.
p172
aVBut the U.S. is losing its idea leadership.
p173
aVAnd for that I am very grateful.
p174
aVThat is a good thing.
p175
aVIt is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader
p176
aVbecause for too long the United States,
p177
aVand a handful of other developed countries,
p178
aVhave shouldered the entire burden
p179
aVof research and development.
p180
aVBut consider the following:
p181
aVif the world as a whole were as wealthy as the United States is now
p182
aVthere would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers
p183
aVcontributing to ideas which benefit everyone,
p184
aVwhich are shared by everyone.
p185
aVI think of the great Indian mathematician, Ramanujan.
p186
aVHow many Ramanujans are there in India today
p187
aVtoiling in the fields, barely able to feed themselves,
p188
aVwhen they could be feeding the world?
p189
aVNow we're not there yet.
p190
aVBut it is going to happen in this century.
p191
aVThe real tragedy of the last century is this:
p192
aVif you think about the world's population
p193
aVas a giant computer, a massively parallel processor,
p194
aVthen the great tragedy has been
p195
aVthat billions of our processors have been off line.
p196
aVBut in this century China is coming on line.
p197
aVIndia is coming on line.
p198
aVAfrica is coming on line.
p199
aVWe will see an Einstein in Africa in this century.
p200
aa(lp201
VHere is just some data. This is China.
p202
aV1996: less than one million
p203
aVnew university students in China per year;
p204
aV2006: over five million.
p205
aVNow think what this means.
p206
aVThis means we all benefit when another country gets rich.
p207
aVWe should not fear other countries becoming wealthy.
p208
aVThat is something that we should embrace \u2014
p209
aVa wealthy China, a wealthy India, a wealthy Africa.
p210
aVWe need a greater demand for ideas \u2014
p211
aVthose larger markets I was talking about earlier \u2014
p212
aVand a greater supply of ideas for the world.
p213
aVNow you can see some of the reasons why I'm optimistic.
p214
aVGlobalization is increasing the demand
p215
aVfor ideas, the incentive to create new ideas.
p216
aVInvestments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas.
p217
aa(lp218
VIn fact if you look at world history
p219
aVyou can see some reasons for optimism.
p220
aVFrom about the beginnings of humanity
p221
aVto 1500: zero economic growth, nothing.
p222
aV1500 to 1800: maybe a little bit of economic growth,
p223
aVbut less in a century
p224
aVthan you expect to see in a year today.
p225
aV1900s: maybe one percent.
p226
aVTwentieth century: a little bit over two percent.
p227
aVTwenty-first century could easily be 3.3, even higher percent.
p228
aVEven at that rate,
p229
aVby 2100 average GDP per capita
p230
aVin the world will be $200,000.
p231
aVThat's not U.S. GDP per capita, which will be over a million,
p232
aVbut world GDP per capita \u2014 $200,000.
p233
aVThat's not that far.
p234
aVWe won't make it.
p235
aVBut some of our grandchildren probably will.
p236
aVAnd I should say,
p237
aVI think this is a rather modest prediction.
p238
aVIn Kurzweilian terms this is gloomy.
p239
aVIn Kurzweilian terms I'm like the Eeyore of economic growth.
p240
aV(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VAlright what about problems?
p243
aVWhat about a great depression?
p244
aVWell let's take a look. Let's take a look at the Great Depression.
p245
aVHere is GDP per capita
p246
aVfrom 1900 to 1929.
p247
aVNow let's imagine that you were an economist in 1929,
p248
aVtrying to forecast future growth for the United States,
p249
aVnot knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff,
p250
aVnot knowing that we were about to enter
p251
aVthe greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century.
p252
aVWhat would you have predicted, not knowing this?
p253
aVIf you had based your prediction, your forecast
p254
aVon 1900 to 1929
p255
aVyou'd have predicted something like this.
p256
aVIf you'd been a little more optimistic \u2014
p257
aVsay, based upon the Roaring Twenties \u2014 you'd have said this.
p258
aVSo what actually happened?
p259
aVWe went off a cliff but we recovered.
p260
aVIn fact in the second half of the 20th century
p261
aVgrowth was even higher than anything you would have predicted
p262
aVbased upon the first half of the 20th century.
p263
aVSo growth can wash away
p264
aVeven what appears to be a great depression.
p265
aa(lp266
VAlright. What else?
p267
aVOil. Oil. This was a big topic.
p268
aVWhen I was writing up my notes oil was $140 per barrel.
p269
aVSo people were asking a question. They were saying,
p270
aV"Is China drinking our milkshake?"
p271
aV(Laughter)
p272
aVAnd there is some truth to this,
p273
aVin the sense that we have something of a finite resource,
p274
aVand increased growth is going to push up demand for that.
p275
aVBut I think I don't have to tell this audience
p276
aVthat a higher price of oil is not necessarily a bad thing.
p277
aVMoreover, as everyone knows,
p278
aVlook \u2014 it's energy, not oil, which counts.
p279
aVAnd higher oil prices mean
p280
aVa greater incentive to invest in energy R&D.
p281
aVYou can see this in the data.
p282
aVAs oil prices go up, energy patents go up.
p283
aVThe world is much better equipped
p284
aVto overcome an increase in the price of oil
p285
aVtoday, than ever in the past,
p286
aVbecause of what I'm talking about.
p287
aVOne idea, one world, one market.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo I'm optimistic
p290
aVso long as we hew to these two ideas:
p291
aVto keep globalizing world markets,
p292
aVkeep extending cooperation across national boundaries,
p293
aVand keep investing in education.
p294
aVNow the United States has a particularly important role
p295
aVto play in this:
p296
aVto keep our education system globalized,
p297
aVto keep our education system open to students from all over the world,
p298
aVbecause our education system
p299
aVis the candle
p300
aVthat other students come to light their own candles.
p301
aVNow remember here what Jefferson said.
p302
aVJefferson said, "When they come
p303
aVand light their candles at ours,
p304
aVthey gain light, and we are not darkened."
p305
aVBut Jefferson wasn't quite right, was he?
p306
aVBecause the truth is,
p307
aVwhen they light their candles at ours,
p308
aVthere is twice as much light available for everyone.
p309
aVSo my view is: Be optimistic.
p310
aVSpread the ideas. Spread the light.
p311
aVThank you.
