VNow when we think of our senses,
p4
aVwe don't usually think of the reasons
p5
aVwhy they probably evolved, from a biological perspective.
p6
aVWe don't really think of the evolutionary need
p7
aVto be protected by our senses,
p8
aVbut that's probably why our senses really evolved \u2014
p9
aVto keep us safe, to allow us to live.
p10
aVReally when we think of our senses,
p11
aVor when we think of the loss of the sense,
p12
aVwe really think about something more like this:
p13
aVthe ability to touch something luxurious, to taste something delicious,
p14
aVto smell something fragrant,
p15
aVto see something beautiful.
p16
aVThis is what we want out of our senses.
p17
aVWe want beauty; we don't just want function.
p18
aVAnd when it comes to sensory restoration,
p19
aVwe're still very far away from being able to provide beauty.
p20
aVAnd that's what I'd like to talk to you a little bit about today.
p21
aa(lp22
VLikewise for hearing.
p23
aVWhen we think about why we hear,
p24
aVwe don't often think about the ability to hear an alarm or a siren,
p25
aValthough clearly that's an important thing.
p26
aVReally what we want to hear is music.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Music)
p29
aa(lp30
VSo many of you know that that's Beethoven's Seventh Symphony.
p31
aVMany of you know that he was deaf, or near profoundly deaf,
p32
aVwhen he wrote that.
p33
aVNow I'd like to impress upon you
p34
aVhow unusual it is that we can hear music.
p35
aVMusic is just one of the strangest things that there is.
p36
aVIt's acoustic vibrations in the air,
p37
aVlittle waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum.
p38
aVSomehow in tickling our eardrum
p39
aVthat transmits energy down our hearing bones,
p40
aVwhich get converted to a fluid impulse inside the cochlea
p41
aVand then somehow converted into an electrical signal in our auditory nerves
p42
aVthat somehow wind up in our brains
p43
aVas a perception of a song or a beautiful piece of music.
p44
aVThat process is entirely abstract and very, very unusual.
p45
aVAnd we could discuss that topic alone for days
p46
aVto really try to figure out, how is it that we hear something that's emotional
p47
aVfrom something that starts out as a vibration in the air?
p48
aa(lp49
VTurns out that if you have hearing loss,
p50
aVmost people that lose their hearing
p51
aVlose it at what's called the cochlea, the inner ear.
p52
aVAnd it's at the hair cell level that they do this.
p53
aVNow if you had to pick a sense to lose,
p54
aVI have to be very honest with you
p55
aVand say, we're better at restoring hearing
p56
aVthan we are at restoring any sense that there is.
p57
aVIn fact, nothing even actually comes close
p58
aVto our ability to restore hearing.
p59
aVAnd as a physician and a surgeon, I can confidently tell my patients
p60
aVthat if you had to pick a sense to lose,
p61
aVwe are the furthest along medically and surgically with hearing.
p62
aVAs a musician, I can tell you
p63
aVthat if I had to have a cochlear implant,
p64
aVI'd be heartbroken. I'd just be plainly heartbroken,
p65
aVbecause I know that music would never sound the same to me.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow this is a video that I'm going to show you
p68
aVof a girl who's born deaf.
p69
aVShe's in a very supportive environment.
p70
aVHer mother's doing everything she can.
p71
aVOkay, play that video please.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Video) Mother: That's an owl.
p74
aVOwl, yeah.
p75
aVOwl. Owl.
p76
aVYeah.
p77
aVBaby. Baby.
p78
aVYou want it?
p79
aV(Kiss)
p80
aa(lp81
VCharles Limb: Now despite everything going for this child
p82
aVin terms of family support
p83
aVand simple infused learning,
p84
aVthere is a limitation to what a child who's deaf, an infant who was born deaf,
p85
aVhas in this world
p86
aVin terms of social, educational, vocational opportunities.
p87
aVI'm not saying that they can't live a beautiful, wonderful life.
p88
aVI'm saying that they're going to face obstacles
p89
aVthat most people who have normal hearing will not have to face.
p90
aa(lp91
VNow hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss
p92
aVhas really evolved in the past 200 years.
p93
aVI mean literally,
p94
aVthey used to do things like stick ear-shaped objects onto your ears
p95
aVand stick funnels in.
p96
aVAnd that was the best you could do for hearing loss.
p97
aVBack then you couldn't even look at the eardrum.
p98
aVSo it's not too surprising
p99
aVthat there were no good treatments for hearing loss.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd now today we have the modern multi-channel cochlear implant,
p102
aVwhich is an outpatient procedure.
p103
aVIt's surgically placed inside the inner ear.
p104
aVIt takes about an hour and a half to two hours, depending on where it's done,
p105
aVunder general anesthesia.
p106
aVAnd in the end, you achieve something like this
p107
aVwhere an electrode array is inserted inside the cochlea.
p108
aVNow actually, this is quite crude
p109
aVin comparison to our regular inner ear.
p110
aa(lp111
VBut here is that same girl who is implanted now.
p112
aVThis is her 10 years later.
p113
aVAnd this is a video that was taken
p114
aVby my surgical mentor, Dr. John Niparko, who implanted her.
p115
aVIf we could play this video please.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Video) John Niparko: So you've written two books?
p118
aa(lp119
VGirl: I have written two books. (Mother: Was the other one a book or a journal entry?)
p120
aVGirl: No, the other one was a book. (Mother: Oh, okay.)
p121
aa(lp122
VJN: Well this book has seven chapters,
p123
aVand the last chapter
p124
aVis entitled "The Good Things About Being Deaf."
p125
aVDo you remember writing that chapter?
p126
aa(lp127
VGirl: Yes I do. I remember writing every chapter.
p128
aa(lp129
VJN: Yeah.
p130
aVGirl: Well sometimes my sister can be kind of annoying.
p131
aVSo it comes in handy to not be annoyed by her.
p132
aa(lp133
VJN: I see. And who is that?
p134
aa(lp135
VGirl: Holly. (JN: Okay.)
p136
aa(lp137
VMother: Her sister. (JN: Her sister.) Girl: My sister.
p138
aa(lp139
VJN: And how can you avoid being annoyed by her?
p140
aa(lp141
VGirl: I just take off my CI, and I don't hear anything.
p142
aV(Laughter)
p143
aVIt comes in handy.
p144
aa(lp145
VJN: So you don't want to hear everything that's out there?
p146
aa(lp147
VGirl: No.
p148
aa(lp149
VCL: And so she's phenomenal.
p150
aVAnd there's no way that you can't look at that as an overwhelming success.
p151
aVIt is. It's a huge success story in modern medicine.
p152
aVHowever, despite this incredible facility
p153
aVthat some cochlear implant users display with language,
p154
aVyou turn on the radio and all of a sudden they can't hear music almost at all.
p155
aVIn fact, most implant users really struggle
p156
aVand dislike music because it sounds so bad.
p157
aVAnd so when it comes to this idea
p158
aVof restoring beauty to somebody's life,
p159
aVwe have a long way to go when it comes to audition.
p160
aa(lp161
VNow there are a lot of reasons for that.
p162
aVI mentioned earlier the fact
p163
aVthat music is a different capacity because it's abstract.
p164
aVLanguage is very different. Language is very precise.
p165
aVIn fact, the whole reason we use it
p166
aVis because it has semantic-specificity.
p167
aVWhen you say a word,
p168
aVwhat you care is that word was perceived correctly.
p169
aVYou don't care that the word sounded pretty
p170
aVwhen it was spoken.
p171
aa(lp172
VMusic is entirely different.
p173
aVWhen you hear music, if it doesn't sound good, what's the point?
p174
aVThere's really very little point in listening to music
p175
aVwhen it doesn't sound good to you.
p176
aVThe acoustics of music are much harder than those of language.
p177
aVAnd you can see on this figure,
p178
aVthat the frequency range
p179
aVand the decibel range, the dynamic range of music
p180
aVis far more heterogeneous.
p181
aVSo if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant,
p182
aVwhat we would try to do
p183
aVis target it to be able to allow music transmission.
p184
aVBecause I always view music as the pinnacle of hearing.
p185
aVIf you can hear music,
p186
aVyou should be able to hear anything.
p187
aa(lp188
VNow the problems begin first with pitch perception.
p189
aVI mean, most of us know that pitch is a fundamental building block of music.
p190
aVAnd without the ability to perceive pitch well,
p191
aVmusic and melody is a very difficult thing to do \u2014
p192
aVforget about a harmony and things like that.
p193
aVNow this is a MIDI arrangement of Rachmaninoff's Prelude.
p194
aVNow if we could just play this.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Music)
p197
aa(lp198
VOkay, now if we consider
p199
aVthat in a cochlear implant patient
p200
aVpitch perception could be off as much as two octaves,
p201
aVlet's see what happens here
p202
aVwhen we randomize this to within one semitone.
p203
aVWe would be thrilled if we had one semitone pitch perception in cochlear implant users.
p204
aVGo ahead and play this one.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Music)
p207
aa(lp208
VNow my goal in showing you that
p209
aVis to show you that music is not robust to degradation.
p210
aVYou distort it a little bit, especially in terms of pitch, and you've changed it.
p211
aVAnd it might be that you kind of like that.
p212
aVThat's kind of hypnotic.
p213
aVBut it certainly wasn't the way the music was intended.
p214
aVAnd you're not hearing the same thing
p215
aVthat most people who have normal hearing are hearing.
p216
aa(lp217
VNow the other issue comes with,
p218
aVnot just the ability to tell pitches apart,
p219
aVbut the ability to tell sounds apart.
p220
aVMost cochlear implant users cannot tell the difference between an instrument.
p221
aVIf we could play these two sound clips in succession.
p222
aV(Trumpet)
p223
aVThe trumpet.
p224
aVAnd the second one.
p225
aV(Violin)
p226
aVThat's a violin.
p227
aVThese have similar wave forms. They're both sustained instruments.
p228
aVCochlear implant users cannot tell the difference
p229
aVbetween these instruments.
p230
aVThe sound quality, or the sound of the sound
p231
aVis how I like to describe timbre, tone color \u2014
p232
aVthey cannot tell these things whatsoever.
p233
aVThis implant is not transmitting
p234
aVthe quality of music that usually provides things like warmth.
p235
aa(lp236
VNow if you look at the brain of an individual who has a cochlear implant
p237
aVand you have them listen to speech,
p238
aVhave them listen to rhythm and have them listen to melody,
p239
aVwhat you find is that the auditory cortex
p240
aVis the most active during speech.
p241
aVYou would think that because these implants are optimized for speech,
p242
aVthey were designed for speech.
p243
aVBut actually if you look at melody,
p244
aVwhat you find is that there's very little cortical activity
p245
aVin implant users compared with normal hearing controls.
p246
aVSo for whatever reason,
p247
aVthis implant is not successfully stimulating auditory cortices
p248
aVduring melody perception.
p249
aa(lp250
VNow the next question is,
p251
aVwell how does it really sound?
p252
aVNow we've been doing some studies
p253
aVto really get a sense of what sound quality is like for these implant users.
p254
aVI'm going to play you two clips of Usher,
p255
aVone which is normal
p256
aVand one which has almost no high frequencies, almost no low frequencies
p257
aVand not even that many mid frequencies.
p258
aVGo ahead and play that.
p259
aa(lp260
V(Music)
p261
aa(lp262
V(Limited Frequency Music)
p263
aa(lp264
VI had patients tell me that those sound the same.
p265
aVThey cannot differentiate sound quality differences
p266
aVbetween those two clips.
p267
aVAgain, we are very, very far away in just getting to where we want to get to.
p268
aa(lp269
VNow the question comes to mind: Is there any hope?
p270
aVAnd yes, there is hope.
p271
aVNow I don't know if anybody knows who this is.
p272
aVThis is ... does somebody know?
p273
aVThis is Beethoven.
p274
aVNow why would we know what Beethoven's skull looks like?
p275
aVBecause his grave was exhumed.
p276
aVAnd it turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died
p277
aVto try to look at the cause of his deafness,
p278
aVwhich is why he has molding clay
p279
aVand his skull is bulging out on the side there.
p280
aVBut Beethoven composed music
p281
aVlong after he lost his hearing.
p282
aVWhat that suggests is that, even in the case of hearing loss,
p283
aVthe capacity for music remains.
p284
aVThe brains remain hardwired for music.
p285
aa(lp286
VI've been very lucky to work with Dr. David Ryugo
p287
aVwhere I've been working on deaf cats that are white
p288
aVand trying to figure out what happens when we give them cochlear implants.
p289
aVThis is a cat that's been trained to respond to a trumpet for food.
p290
aa(lp291
V(Music)
p292
aa(lp293
VText: Beethoven doesn't excite her.
p294
aV(Music)
p295
aVThe "1812 Overture" isn't worth waking for.
p296
aV(Trumpet)
p297
aVBut she jumps to action when called to duty!
p298
aV(Trumpet)
p299
aa(lp300
VCL: Now I'm not suggesting
p301
aVthat the cat is hearing that trumpet the way we're hearing it.
p302
aVI'm suggesting that with training
p303
aVyou can imbue a musical sound with significance,
p304
aVeven in a cat.
p305
aVIf we were to direct efforts
p306
aVtowards training cochlear implant users to hear music \u2014
p307
aVbecause right now there's virtually no effort put towards that,
p308
aVno rehabilitative strategies,
p309
aVvery little in the way of technological advances to actually improve music \u2014
p310
aVwe would come a long way.
p311
aa(lp312
VNow I want to show you one last video.
p313
aVAnd this is of a student of mine named Joseph
p314
aVwho I had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab.
p315
aVHe's deaf, and he learned to play the piano
p316
aVafter he received the cochlear implant.
p317
aVAnd here's a video of Joseph.
p318
aa(lp319
V(Music)
p320
aa(lp321
V(Video) Joseph: I was born in 1986.
p322
aVAnd at about four months old,
p323
aVI was diagnosed with profoundly severe hearing loss.
p324
aVNot long after,
p325
aVI was fitted with hearing aids.
p326
aVBut although these hearing aids
p327
aVwere the most powerful hearing aids on the market at the time,
p328
aVthey weren't very helpful.
p329
aVSo as a result, I had to rely on lip reading a lot,
p330
aVand I couldn't really hear what people were saying.
p331
aVWhen I was 12 years old,
p332
aVI was one of the first few people in Singapore
p333
aVwho underwent cochlear implantation.
p334
aVAnd not long after I got my cochlear implant,
p335
aVI started learning how to play piano.
p336
aVAnd it was absolutely wonderful.
p337
aVSince then, I've never looked back.
p338
aa(lp339
VCL: Joseph is phenomenal. He's brilliant.
p340
aVHe is now a medical student at Yale University,
p341
aVand he's contemplating a surgical career \u2014
p342
aVone of the first deaf individuals to consider a career in surgery.
p343
aVThere are almost no deaf surgeons anywhere.
p344
aVAnd this is really unheard of stuff, and this is all because of this technology.
p345
aVAnd the fact that he can play the piano like that
p346
aVis a testament to his brain.
p347
aVTruth of the matter is you can play the piano without a cochlear implant,
p348
aVbecause all you have to do is press the keys at the right time.
p349
aVYou don't actually have to hear it.
p350
aVI know he doesn't hear well, because I've heard him do Karaoke.
p351
aV(Laughter)
p352
aVAnd it's one of the most awful things \u2014
p353
aVheartwarming, but awful.
p354
aV(Laughter)
p355
aVAnd so there is certainly a lot of hope,
p356
aVbut there's a lot more that needs to be done.
p357
aa(lp358
VSo I just want to conclude with the following words.
p359
aVWhen it comes to restoration of hearing,
p360
aVwe have certainly come a long way, a remarkably long way.
p361
aVAnd we have a much longer way to go
p362
aVwhen it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing.
p363
aVAnd let me tell you right now,
p364
aVit's fine that we would all be very happy with speech.
p365
aVBut I tell you, if we lost our hearing,
p366
aVif anyone here suddenly lost your hearing,
p367
aVyou would want perfect hearing back.
p368
aVYou wouldn't want decent hearing, you would want perfect hearing.
p369
aVRestoration of basic sensory function is critical.
p370
aVAnd I don't mean to understate
p371
aVhow important it is to restore basic function.
p372
aVBut it's really restoration of the ability to perceive beauty
p373
aVwhere we can get inspiring.
p374
aVAnd I don't think that we should give up on beauty.
p375
aa(lp376
VAnd I want to thank you for your time.
