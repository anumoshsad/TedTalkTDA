VImagine a place where your neighbors greet your children by name;
p4
aVa place with splendid vistas;
p5
aVa place where you can drive just 20 minutes
p6
aVand put your sailboat on the water.
p7
aVIt's a seductive place, isn't it?
p8
aa(lp9
VI don't live there.
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aVBut I did journey on a 27,000-mile trip
p12
aVfor two years, to the fastest-growing and whitest counties in America.
p13
aa(lp14
VWhat is a Whitopia?
p15
aVI define Whitopia in three ways:
p16
aVFirst, a Whitopia has posted at least six percent population growth since 2000.
p17
aVSecondly, the majority of that growth comes from white migrants.
p18
aVAnd third, the Whitopia has an ineffable charm,
p19
aVa pleasant look and feel,
p20
aVa je Ne sais quoi.
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VTo learn how and why Whitopias are ticking,
p24
aVI immersed myself for several months apiece in three of them:
p25
aVfirst, St. George, Utah;
p26
aVsecond, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho;
p27
aVand third, Forsyth County, Georgia.
p28
aa(lp29
VFirst stop, St. George \u2014 a beautiful town of red rock landscapes.
p30
aVIn the 1850s, Brigham Young dispatched families to St. George
p31
aVto grow cotton because of the hot, arid climate.
p32
aVAnd so they called it Utah's Dixie, and the name sticks to this day.
p33
aVI approached my time in each Whitopia like an anthropologist.
p34
aVI made detailed spreadsheets of all the power brokers in the communities,
p35
aVwho I needed to meet, where I needed to be,
p36
aVand I threw myself with gusto in these communities.
p37
aVI went to zoning board meetings,
p38
aVI went to Democratic clubs and Republican clubs.
p39
aVI went to poker nights.
p40
aVIn St. George, I rented a home at the Entrada,
p41
aVone of the town's premier gated communities.
p42
aVThere were no Motel 6's or Howard Johnsons for me.
p43
aVI lived in Whitopia as a resident, and not like a visitor.
p44
aa(lp45
VI rented myself this home by phone.
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aV(Applause)
p48
aa(lp49
VGolf is the perfect seductive symbol of Whitopia.
p50
aVWhen I went on my journey,
p51
aVI had barely ever held a golf club.
p52
aVBy the time I left, I was golfing at least three times a week.
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VGolf helps people bond.
p56
aVSome of the best interviews I ever scored during my trip were on the golf courses.
p57
aVOne venture capitalist, for example, invited me to golf in his private club
p58
aVthat had no minority members.
p59
aa(lp60
VI also went fishing.
p61
aV(Laughter)
p62
aVBecause I had never fished, this fellow had to teach me
p63
aVhow to cast my line and what bait to use.
p64
aa(lp65
VI also played poker every weekend.
p66
aVIt was Texas Hold 'em with a $10 buy-in.
p67
aVMy poker mates may have been bluffing about the hands that they drew,
p68
aVbut they weren't bluffing about their social beliefs.
p69
aVSome of the most raw, salty conversations I ever had
p70
aVduring my journey were at the poker table.
p71
aa(lp72
VI'm a gung ho entertainer.
p73
aVI love to cook, I hosted many dinner parties, and in return,
p74
aVpeople invited me to their dinner parties,
p75
aVand to their barbecues, and to their pool parties,
p76
aVand to their birthday parties.
p77
aa(lp78
VBut it wasn't all fun.
p79
aVImmigration turned out to be a big issue in this Whitopia.
p80
aVThe St. George's Citizens Council on Illegal Immigration
p81
aVheld regular and active protests against immigration,
p82
aVand so what I gleaned from this Whitopia is what a hot debate this would become.
p83
aVIt was a real-time preview, and so it has become.
p84
aa(lp85
VNext stop: Almost Heaven, a cabin I rented for myself
p86
aVin Coeur d'Alene, in the beautiful North Idaho panhandle.
p87
aVI rented this place for myself, also by phone.
p88
aV(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VThe book "A Thousand Places To See Before You Die" lists Coeur d'Alene \u2014
p91
aVit's a gorgeous paradise for huntsmen, boatmen and fishermen.
p92
aa(lp93
VMy growing golf skills came in handy in Coeur d'Alene.
p94
aVI golfed with retired LAPD cops.
p95
aVIn 1993, around 11,000 families and cops
p96
aVfled Los Angeles after the L.A. racial unrest,
p97
aVfor North Idaho, and they've built an expatriated community.
p98
aVGiven the conservatism of these cops,
p99
aVthere's no surprise that North Idaho has a strong gun culture.
p100
aVIn fact, it is said, North Idaho has more gun dealers than gas stations.
p101
aVSo what's a resident to do to fit in?
p102
aVI hit the gun club.
p103
aVWhen I rented a gun, the gentleman behind the counter
p104
aVwas perfectly pleasant and kind,
p105
aVuntil I showed him my New York City driver's license.
p106
aVThat's when he got nervous.
p107
aVI'm not as bad a shot as I thought I might have been.
p108
aa(lp109
VWhat I learned from North Idaho is the peculiar brand of paranoia
p110
aVthat can permeate a community when so many cops and guns are around.
p111
aa(lp112
VIn North Idaho, in my red pickup truck,
p113
aVI kept a notepad.
p114
aVAnd in that notepad I counted more Confederate flags than black people.
p115
aVIn North Idaho, I found Confederate flags
p116
aVon key chains, on cellphone paraphernalia,
p117
aVand on cars.
p118
aa(lp119
VAbout a seven-minute drive from my hidden lake cabin
p120
aVwas the compound of Aryan Nations,
p121
aVthe white supremacist group.
p122
aVAmerica's Promise Ministries, the religious arm of Aryan Nations,
p123
aVhappened to have a three-day retreat during my visit.
p124
aVSo I decided to crash it.
p125
aV(Laughter)
p126
aVI'm the only non-Aryan journalist I'm aware of ever to have done so.
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aVAmong the many memorable episodes of that retreat...
p129
aV(Laughter)
p130
aV...is when Abe, an Aryan, sidled up next to me.
p131
aVHe slapped my knee, and he said, "Hey Rich, I just want you to know one thing.
p132
aVWe are not white supremacists. We are white separatists.
p133
aVWe don't think we're better than you,
p134
aVwe just want to be away from you."
p135
aV(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VIndeed, most white people in Whitopia are neither white supremacists
p138
aVor white separatists;
p139
aVin fact, they're not there for explicitly racial reasons at all.
p140
aVRather, they emigrate there
p141
aVfor friendliness, comfort, security, safety \u2014
p142
aVreasons that they implicitly associate to whiteness in itself.
p143
aa(lp144
VNext stop was Georgia.
p145
aVIn Georgia, I stayed in an exurb north of Atlanta.
p146
aVIn Utah, I found poker;
p147
aVin Idaho, I found guns;
p148
aVin Georgia, I found God.
p149
aV(Laughter)
p150
aVThe way that I immersed myself in this Whitopia
p151
aVwas to become active at First Redeemer Church,
p152
aVa megachurch that's so huge that it has golf carts
p153
aVto escort the congregants around its many parking lots on campus.
p154
aVI was active in the youth ministry.
p155
aVAnd for me, personally, I was more comfortable in this Whitopia
p156
aVthan say, in a Colorado, or an Idaho, or even a suburban Boston.
p157
aVThat is because [there], in Georgia,
p158
aVwhite people and black people are more historically familiar to one another.
p159
aVI was less exotic in this Whitopia.
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VBut what does it all mean?
p163
aVWhitopian dreaming, Whitopia migration, is a push-pull phenomenon,
p164
aVfull of alarming pushes and alluring pulls,
p165
aVand Whitopia operates at the level of conscious and unconscious bias.
p166
aVIt's possible for people to be in Whitopia not for racist reasons,
p167
aVthough it has racist outcomes.
p168
aVMany Whitopians feel pushed by illegals,
p169
aVsocial welfare abuse, minorities, density, crowded schools.
p170
aVMany Whitopians feel pulled by merit,
p171
aVfreedom, the allure of privatism \u2014 privatized places, privatized people,
p172
aVprivatized things.
p173
aVAnd I learned in Whitopia how a country can have racism
p174
aVwithout racists.
p175
aa(lp176
VMany of my smug urban liberal friends
p177
aVcouldn't believe I would go on such a venture.
p178
aVThe reality is that many white Americans are affable and kind.
p179
aVInterpersonal race relations \u2014 how we treat each other as human beings \u2014
p180
aVare vastly better than in my parents' generation.
p181
aVCan you imagine me going to Whitopia 40 years ago?
p182
aVWhat a journey that would have been.
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aVAnd yet, some things haven't changed.
p185
aVAmerica is as residentially and educationally segregated today
p186
aVas it was in 1970.
p187
aa(lp188
VAs Americans, we often find ways to cook for each other,
p189
aVto dance with each other,
p190
aVto host with each other,
p191
aVbut why can't that translate into how we treat each other as communities?
p192
aVIt's a devastating irony,
p193
aVhow we have gone forward as individuals,
p194
aVand backwards as communities.
p195
aa(lp196
VOne of the Whitopian outlooks that really hit me
p197
aVwas a proverbial saying:
p198
aV"One black man is a delightful dinner guest;
p199
aV50 black men is a ghetto."
p200
aa(lp201
VOne of the big contexts animating my Whitopian journey was the year 2042.
p202
aVBy 2042, white people will no longer be the American majority.
p203
aVAs such, will there be more Whitopias?
p204
aVIn looking at this,
p205
aVthe danger of Whitopia is that the more segregation we have,
p206
aVthe less we can look at and confront conscious and unconscious bias.
p207
aa(lp208
VI ventured on my two-year, 27,000 mile journey
p209
aVto learn where, why, and how white people are fleeing,
p210
aVbut I didn't expect to have so much fun on my journey.
p211
aV(Laughter)
p212
aVI didn't expect to learn so much about myself.
p213
aVI don't expect I'll be living in a Whitopia \u2014
p214
aVor a Blacktopia, for that matter.
p215
aVI do plan to continue golfing every chance I get.
p216
aV(Laughter)
p217
aVAnd I'll just have to leave the guns and megachurches back in Whitopia.
p218
aa(lp219
VThank you.
