VSo in my free time outside of Twitter
p4
aVI experiment a little bit
p5
aVwith telling stories online, experimenting
p6
aVwith what we can do with new digital tools.
p7
aVAnd in my job at Twitter,
p8
aVI actually spent a little bit of time
p9
aVworking with authors and storytellers as well,
p10
aVhelping to expand out the bounds
p11
aVof what people are experimenting with.
p12
aVAnd I want to talk through some examples today
p13
aVof things that people have done
p14
aVthat I think are really fascinating
p15
aVusing flexible identity and anonymity on the web
p16
aVand blurring the lines between fact and fiction.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut I want to start and go back to the 1930s.
p19
aVLong before a little thing called Twitter,
p20
aVradio brought us broadcasts
p21
aVand connected millions of people
p22
aVto single points of broadcast.
p23
aVAnd from those single points emanated stories.
p24
aVSome of them were familiar stories.
p25
aVSome of them were new stories.
p26
aVAnd for a while they were familiar formats,
p27
aVbut then radio began to evolve its own
p28
aVunique formats specific to that medium.
p29
aVThink about episodes that happened live on radio.
p30
aa(lp31
VCombining the live play
p32
aVand the serialization of written fiction,
p33
aVyou get this new format.
p34
aVAnd the reason why I bring up radio is that I think
p35
aVradio is a great example of how a new medium
p36
aVdefines new formats which then define new stories.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd of course, today, we have an entirely new
p39
aVmedium to play with,
p40
aVwhich is this online world.
p41
aVThis is the map of verified users on Twitter
p42
aVand the connections between them.
p43
aVThere are thousands upon thousands of them.
p44
aVEvery single one of these points
p45
aVis its own broadcaster.
p46
aVWe've gone to this world of many to many,
p47
aVwhere access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting.
p48
aVAnd I think that we should start to see
p49
aVwildly new formats emerge
p50
aVas people learn how to tell stories in this new medium.
p51
aVI actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier
p52
aVfor creative experimentation, if you will,
p53
aVthat we've explored and begun to settle
p54
aVthis wild land of the Internet
p55
aVand are now just getting ready
p56
aVto start to build structures on it,
p57
aVand those structures are the new formats
p58
aVof storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create.
p59
aa(lp60
VI believe this starts with an evolution
p61
aVof existing methods.
p62
aVThe short story, for example,
p63
aVpeople are saying that the short story
p64
aVis experiencing a renaissance of sorts
p65
aVthanks to e-readers, digital marketplaces.
p66
aVOne writer, Hugh Howey, experimented
p67
aVwith short stories on Amazon
p68
aVby releasing one very short story called "Wool."
p69
aVAnd he actually says that he didn't intend
p70
aVfor "Wool" to become a series,
p71
aVbut that the audience loved the first story so much
p72
aVthey demanded more, and so he gave them more.
p73
aVHe gave them "Wool 2," which was a little bit longer than the first one,
p74
aV"Wool 3," which was even longer,
p75
aVculminating in "Wool 5,"
p76
aVwhich was a 60,000-word novel.
p77
aVI think Howey was able to do all of this because
p78
aVhe had the quick feedback system of e-books.
p79
aVHe was able to write and publish
p80
aVin relatively short order.
p81
aVThere was no mediator between him and the audience.
p82
aVIt was just him directly connected with his audience
p83
aVand building on the feedback and enthusiasm
p84
aVthat they were giving him.
p85
aVSo this whole project was an experiment.
p86
aVIt started with the one short story,
p87
aVand I think the experimentation actually became
p88
aVa part of Howey's format.
p89
aVAnd that's something that this medium enabled,
p90
aVwas experimentation being a part of the format itself.
p91
aa(lp92
VThis is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan
p93
aVcalled "Black Box."
p94
aVIt was originally written
p95
aVspecifically with Twitter in mind.
p96
aVEgan convinced The New Yorker
p97
aVto start a New Yorker fiction account
p98
aVfrom which they could tweet
p99
aVall of these lines that she created.
p100
aVNow Twitter, of course, has a 140-character limit.
p101
aVEgan mocked that up just writing manually
p102
aVin this storyboard sketchbook,
p103
aVused the physical space constraints
p104
aVof those storyboard squares
p105
aVto write each individual tweet,
p106
aVand those tweets ended up becoming
p107
aVover 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker.
p108
aVEvery night, at 8 p.m., you could tune in
p109
aVto a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account.
p110
aVI think that's pretty exciting:
p111
aVtune-in literary fiction.
p112
aVThe experience of Egan's story, of course,
p113
aVlike anything on Twitter, there were multiple ways to experience it.
p114
aVYou could scroll back through it,
p115
aVbut interestingly, if you were watching it live,
p116
aVthere was this suspense that built
p117
aVbecause the actual tweets,
p118
aVyou had no control over when you would read them.
p119
aVThey were coming at a pretty regular clip,
p120
aVbut as the story was building,
p121
aVnormally, as a reader, you control how fast you move through a text,
p122
aVbut in this case, The New Yorker did,
p123
aVand they were sending you bit by bit by bit,
p124
aVand you had this suspense of waiting for the next line.
p125
aa(lp126
VAnother great example of fiction
p127
aVand the short story on Twitter,
p128
aVElliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called "Evidence."
p129
aVIt began with this tweet: "On November 28
p130
aVat 10:13 p.m.,
p131
aVa woman identified as Miranda Brown,
p132
aV44, of Brooklyn, fell to her death
p133
aVfrom the roof of a Manhattan hotel."
p134
aVIt begins in Elliott's voice,
p135
aVbut then Elliott's voice recedes,
p136
aVand we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot and Simon,
p137
aVcharacters that Elliott created on Twitter
p138
aVspecifically to tell this story,
p139
aVa story from multiple perspectives
p140
aVleading up to this moment at 10:13 p.m.
p141
aVwhen this woman falls to her death.
p142
aVThese three characters brought an authentic vision
p143
aVfrom multiple perspectives.
p144
aVOne reviewer called Elliott's story
p145
aV"Twitter fiction done right," because she did.
p146
aVShe captured that voice
p147
aVand she had multiple characters and it happened in real time.
p148
aVInterestingly, though, it wasn't just
p149
aVTwitter as a distribution mechanism.
p150
aVIt was also Twitter as a production mechanism.
p151
aVElliott told me later
p152
aVshe wrote the whole thing with her thumbs.
p153
aVShe laid on the couch and just went back and forth
p154
aVbetween different characters
p155
aVtweeting out each line, line by line.
p156
aVI think that this kind of spontaneous creation
p157
aVof what was coming out of the characters' voices
p158
aVreally lent an authenticity to the characters themselves,
p159
aVbut also to this format that she had created
p160
aVof multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter.
p161
aa(lp162
VAs you begin to play with flexible identity online,
p163
aVit gets even more interesting
p164
aVas you start to interact with the real world.
p165
aVThings like Invisible Obama
p166
aVor the famous "binders full of women"
p167
aVthat came up during the 2012 election cycle,
p168
aVor even the fan fiction universe of "West Wing" Twitter
p169
aVin which you have all of these accounts
p170
aVfor every single one of the characters in "The West Wing,"
p171
aVincluding the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window
p172
aVin one single episode. (Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VAll of these are rapid iterations on a theme.
p175
aVThey are creative people experimenting
p176
aVwith the bounds of what is possible in this medium.
p177
aVYou look at something like "West Wing" Twitter,
p178
aVin which you have these fictional characters
p179
aVthat engage with the real world.
p180
aVThey comment on politics,
p181
aVthey cry out against the evils of Congress.
p182
aVKeep in mind, they're all Democrats.
p183
aVAnd they engage with the real world.
p184
aVThey respond to it.
p185
aVSo once you take flexible identity,
p186
aVanonymity, engagement with the real world,
p187
aVand you move beyond simple homage or parody
p188
aVand you put these tools to work in telling a story,
p189
aVthat's when things get really interesting.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo during the Chicago mayoral election
p192
aVthere was a parody account.
p193
aVIt was Mayor Emanuel.
p194
aVIt gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel,
p195
aVparticularly in the expletive department.
p196
aVThis foul-mouthed account
p197
aVfollowed the daily activities of the race,
p198
aVproviding commentary as it went.
p199
aVIt followed all of the natural tropes
p200
aVof a good, solid Twitter parody account,
p201
aVbut then started to get weird.
p202
aVAnd as it progressed, it moved from this commentary
p203
aVto a multi-week, real-time science fiction epic
p204
aVin which your protagonist, Rahm Emanuel,
p205
aVengages in multi-dimensional travel on election day,
p206
aVwhich is \u2014 it didn't actually happen.
p207
aVI double checked the newspapers.
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd then, very interestingly, it came to an end.
p210
aVThis is something that doesn't usually happen
p211
aVwith a Twitter parody account.
p212
aVIt ended, a true narrative conclusion.
p213
aVAnd so the author, Dan Sinker, who was a journalist,
p214
aVwho was completely anonymous this whole time,
p215
aVI think Dan \u2014 it made a lot of sense for him
p216
aVto turn this into a book,
p217
aVbecause it was a narrative format in the end,
p218
aVand I think that turning it into a book
p219
aVis representative of this idea that he had created something new
p220
aVthat needed to be translated into previous formats.
p221
aa(lp222
VOne of my favorite examples
p223
aVof something that's happening on Twitter right now,
p224
aVactually, is the very absurdist Crimer Show.
p225
aVCrimer Show tells the story
p226
aVof a supercriminal and a hapless detective
p227
aVthat face off in this exceptionally strange lingo,
p228
aVwith all of the tropes of a television show.
p229
aVCrimer Show's creator has said that
p230
aVit is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K.,
p231
aVbut, man, is it weird.
p232
aVAnd there are all these times where Crimer,
p233
aVthe supercriminal, does all of these TV things.
p234
aVHe's always taking off his sunglasses
p235
aVor turning to the camera,
p236
aVbut these things just happen in text.
p237
aVI think borrowing all of these tropes from television
p238
aVand additionally presenting each Crimer Show
p239
aVas an episode, spelled E-P-P-A-S-O-D, "eppasod,"
p240
aVpresenting them as episodes
p241
aVreally, it creates something new.
p242
aVThere is a new "eppasod" of Crimer Show
p243
aVon Twitter pretty much every day,
p244
aVand they're archived that way.
p245
aVAnd I think this is an interesting experiment in format.
p246
aVSomething totally new has been created here
p247
aVout of parodying something on television.
p248
aa(lp249
VI think in nonfiction real-time storytelling,
p250
aVthere are a lot of really excellent examples as well.
p251
aVRealTimeWWII is an account
p252
aVthat documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago
p253
aVin exceptional detail, as if
p254
aVyou were reading the news reports from that day.
p255
aVAnd the author Teju Cole has done
p256
aVa lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist
p257
aVon events of the news.
p258
aVIn this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes.
p259
aVI think that in both of these examples,
p260
aVyou're beginning to see ways in which
p261
aVpeople are telling stories with nonfiction content
p262
aVthat can be built into new types
p263
aVof fictional storytelling.
p264
aa(lp265
VSo with real-time storytelling,
p266
aVblurring the lines between fact and fiction,
p267
aVthe real world and the digital world,
p268
aVflexible identity, anonymity,
p269
aVthese are all tools that we have accessible to us,
p270
aVand I think that they're just the building blocks.
p271
aVThey are the bits that we use
p272
aVto create the structures, the frames,
p273
aVthat then become our settlements on this
p274
aVwide open frontier for creative experimentation.
p275

VThank you.
