VI want you to take a trip with me.
p4
aVPicture yourself driving
p5
aVdown a small road in Africa,
p6
aVand as you drive along, you look off to the side,
p7
aVand this is what you see:
p8
aVyou see a field of graves.
p9
aVAnd you stop, and you get out of your car and you take a picture.
p10
aVAnd you go into the town,
p11
aVand you inquire, "What's going on here?"
p12
aVand people are initially reluctant to tell you.
p13
aVAnd then someone says,
p14
aV"These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community."
p15
aVHIV isn't like other medical conditions;
p16
aVit's stigmatizing.
p17
aVPeople are reluctant to talk about it \u2014
p18
aVthere's a fear associated with it.
p19
aVAnd I'm going to talk about HIV today,
p20
aVabout the deaths,
p21
aVabout the stigma.
p22
aVIt's a medical story, but more than that, it's a social story.
p23
aa(lp24
VThis map depicts the global distribution of HIV.
p25
aVAnd as you can see,
p26
aVAfrica has a disproportionate share of the infection.
p27
aVThere are 33 million people
p28
aVliving with HIV in the world today.
p29
aVOf these, two-thirds, 22 million
p30
aVare living in sub-Saharan Africa.
p31
aVThere are 1.4 million pregnant women
p32
aVin low- and middle-income countries living with HIV
p33
aVand of these, 90 percent
p34
aVare in sub-Saharan Africa.
p35
aVWe talk about things in relative terms.
p36
aVAnd I'm going to talk about annual pregnancies
p37
aVand HIV-positive mothers.
p38
aVThe United States \u2014 a large country \u2014
p39
aVeach year, 7,000 mothers with HIV
p40
aVwho give birth to a child.
p41
aVBut you go to Rwanda \u2014 a very small country \u2014
p42
aV8,000 mothers with HIV who are pregnant.
p43
aVAnd then you go to Baragwanath Hospital,
p44
aVoutside of Johannesburg in South Africa,
p45
aVand 8,000 HIV-positive pregnant women
p46
aVgiving birth \u2014
p47
aVa hospital the same as a country.
p48
aVAnd to realize that this is just the tip of an iceberg
p49
aVthat when you compare
p50
aVeverything here to South Africa, it just pales,
p51
aVbecause in South Africa,
p52
aVeach year 300,000 mothers with HIV
p53
aVgive birth to children.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo we talk about PMTCT,
p56
aVand we refer to PMTCT, prevention of mother to child transmission.
p57
aVI think there's an assumption amongst most people in the public
p58
aVthat if a mother is HIV-positive,
p59
aVshe's going to infect her child.
p60
aVThe reality is really, very different.
p61
aVIn resource-rich countries,
p62
aVwith all the tests and treatment we currently have,
p63
aVless than two percent of babies are born HIV-positive \u2014
p64
aV98 percent of babies are born HIV-negative.
p65
aVAnd yet, the reality in resource-poor countries,
p66
aVin the absence of tests and treatment,
p67
aV40 percent \u2014 40 percent of children are infected \u2014
p68
aV40 percent versus two percent \u2014
p69
aVan enormous difference.
p70
aVSo these programs \u2014
p71
aVand I'm going to refer to PMTCT though my talk \u2014
p72
aVthese prevention programs,
p73
aVsimply, they're the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers
p74
aVto prevent them from infecting their babies,
p75
aVand also the medicines we give to mothers
p76
aVto keep them healthy and alive to raise their children.
p77
aVSo it's the test a mother gets when she comes in.
p78
aVIt's the drugs she receives
p79
aVto protect the baby that's inside the uterus and during delivery.
p80
aVIt's the guidance she gets around infant feeding
p81
aVand safer sex.
p82
aVIt's an entire package of services,
p83
aVand it works.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo in the United States,
p86
aVsince the advent of treatment in the middle of the 1990s,
p87
aVthere's been an 80-percent decline
p88
aVin the number of HIV-infected children.
p89
aVLess than 100 babies are born with HIV
p90
aVeach year in the United States
p91
aVand yet, still,
p92
aVover 400,000 children
p93
aVare born every year in the world today with HIV.
p94
aVWhat does that mean?
p95
aVIt means 1,100 children infected each day \u2014
p96
aV1,100 children each day, infected with HIV.
p97
aVAnd where do they come from?
p98
aVWell, less than one comes from the United States.
p99
aVOne, on average, comes from Europe.
p100
aV100 come from Asia and the Pacific.
p101
aVAnd each day,
p102
aVa thousand babies \u2014 a thousand babies
p103
aVare born each day with HIV in Africa.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo again, I look at the globe here
p106
aVand the disproportionate share of HIV in Africa.
p107
aVAnd let's look at another map.
p108
aVAnd here, again, we see
p109
aVAfrica has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors.
p110
aVThat thin sliver you see here, that's Africa.
p111
aVAnd it's the same with nurses.
p112
aVThe truth is sub-Saharan Africa
p113
aVhas 24 percent
p114
aVof the global disease burden
p115
aVand yet only three percent of the world's health care workers.
p116
aVThat means doctors and nurses
p117
aVsimply don't have the time to take care of patients.
p118
aVA nurse in a busy clinic
p119
aVwill see 50 to 100 patients in a day,
p120
aVwhich leaves her just minutes per patient \u2014
p121
aVminutes per patient.
p122
aVAnd so when we look at these PMTCT programs, what does it mean?
p123
aa(lp124
VWell, back in 2001,
p125
aVwhen there was just a simple test
p126
aVand a single dose of a drug,
p127
aVa nurse, in the course of her few minutes with a patient,
p128
aVwould have to counsel for the HIV test, perform the HIV test,
p129
aVexplain the results, dispense a single dose of the drug, Nevirapine,
p130
aVexplain how to take it, discuss infant feeding options, reinforce infant feeding,
p131
aVand test the baby \u2014 in minutes.
p132
aVWell, fortunately since 2001,
p133
aVwe've got new treatments, new tests,
p134
aVand we're far more successful,
p135
aVbut we don't have any more nurses.
p136
aVAnd so these are the tests
p137
aVa nurse now has to do
p138
aVin those same few minutes.
p139
aVIt's not possible \u2014
p140
aVit doesn't work.
p141
aVAnd so we need to find
p142
aVbetter ways of providing care.
p143
aa(lp144
VThis is a picture of a maternal health clinic in Africa \u2014
p145
aVmothers coming, pregnant and with their babies.
p146
aVThese women are here for care,
p147
aVbut we know that just doing a test,
p148
aVjust giving someone a drug,
p149
aVit's not enough.
p150
aVMeds don't equal medical care.
p151
aVDoctors and nurses, frankly,
p152
aVdon't have the time or skills
p153
aVto tell people what to do in ways they understand.
p154
aVI'm a doctor \u2014 I tell people things to do,
p155
aVand I expect them to follow my guidance \u2014
p156
aVbecause I'm a doctor; I went to Harvard \u2014
p157
aVbut the reality is,
p158
aVif I tell a patient, "You should have safer sex.
p159
aVYou should always use a condom,"
p160
aVand yet, in her relationship, she's not empowered \u2014
p161
aVwhat's going to happen?
p162
aVIf I tell her to take her medicines every day
p163
aVand yet, no one in the household knows about her illness, so
p164
aVit's just not going to work.
p165
aVAnd so we need to do more,
p166
aVwe need to do it differently,
p167
aVwe need to do it in ways that are affordable
p168
aVand accessible and can be taken to scale,
p169
aVwhich means it can be done everywhere.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo, I want to tell you a story \u2014
p172
aVI want to take you on a little trip.
p173
aVImagine yourself, if you can,
p174
aVyou're a young woman in Africa, you're going to the hospital or clinic.
p175
aVYou go in for a test
p176
aVand you find out that you're pregnant, and you're delighted.
p177
aVAnd then they give you another test
p178
aVand they tell you you're HIV-positive, and you're devastated.
p179
aVAnd the nurse takes you into a room,
p180
aVand she tells you about the tests
p181
aVand HIV and the medicines you can take
p182
aVand how to take care of yourself and your baby,
p183
aVand you hear none of it.
p184
aVAll you're hearing is, "I'm going to die,
p185
aVand my baby is going to die."
p186
aVAnd then you're out on the street, and you don't know where to go.
p187
aVAnd you don't know who you can talk to,
p188
aVbecause the truth is, HIV is so stigmatizing
p189
aVthat if you partner, your family, anyone in your home,
p190
aVyou're likely to be thrown out
p191
aVwithout any means of support.
p192
aVAnd this \u2014 this is the face and story
p193
aVof HIV in Africa today.
p194
aa(lp195
VBut we're here to talk about possible solutions
p196
aVand some good news.
p197
aVAnd I want to change the story a little bit.
p198
aVTake the same mother, and the nurse, after she gives her her test,
p199
aVtakes her to a room.
p200
aVThe door opens and there's a room full of mothers, mothers with babies,
p201
aVand they're sitting, and they're talking, they're listening.
p202
aVThey're drinking tea, they're having sandwiches.
p203
aVAnd she goes inside, and woman comes up to her and says,
p204
aV"Welcome to mothers2mothers.
p205
aVHave a seat. You're safe here.
p206
aVWe're all HIV-positive.
p207
aVYou're going to be okay. You're going to live.
p208
aVYour baby is going to be HIV-negative."
p209
aa(lp210
VWe view mothers
p211
aVas a community's single greatest resource.
p212
aVMothers take care of the children, take care of the home.
p213
aVSo often the men are gone.
p214
aVThey're working, or they're not part of the household.
p215
aVOur organization, mothers2mothers,
p216
aVenlists women with HIV
p217
aVas care providers.
p218
aVWe bring mothers who have HIV,
p219
aVwho've been through these PMTCT programs
p220
aVin the very facilities,
p221
aVto come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses
p222
aVas part of the health care team.
p223
aVThese mothers, we call them mentor mothers,
p224
aVare able to engage women
p225
aVwho, just like themselves, pregnant with babies,
p226
aVhave found out about being HIV-positive,
p227
aVwho need support and education.
p228
aVAnd they support them around the diagnosis
p229
aVand educate them about how to take their medicines,
p230
aVhow to take care of themselves,
p231
aVhow to take care of their babies.
p232
aVConsider: if you needed surgery,
p233
aVyou would want the best possible technical surgeon, right?
p234
aVBut if you wanted to understand
p235
aVwhat that surgery would do to your life,
p236
aVyou'd like to engage someone,
p237
aVsomeone who's had the procedure.
p238
aVPatients are experts on their own experience,
p239
aVand they can share that experience with others.
p240
aVThis is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo the mothers who work for us,
p243
aVthey come from the communities in which they work.
p244
aVThey're hired \u2014 they're paid as professional members of the health care teams,
p245
aVjust like doctors and nurses.
p246
aVAnd we open bank accounts for them
p247
aVand they're paid directly into the accounts,
p248
aVbecause their money's protected;
p249
aVthe men can't take it away from them.
p250
aVThey go through two to three weeks
p251
aVof rigorous curriculum-based education, training.
p252
aVNow, doctors and nurses \u2014 they too get trained.
p253
aVBut so often, they only get trained once,
p254
aVso they're not aware of new medicines,
p255
aVnew guidelines as they come out.
p256
aVOur mentor mothers get trained every single year
p257
aVand retrained.
p258
aVAnd so doctors and nurses \u2014
p259
aVthey look up to them as experts.
p260
aVImagine that: a woman, a former patient,
p261
aVbeing able to educate her doctor for the first time
p262
aVand educate the other patients
p263
aVthat she's taking care of.
p264
aa(lp265
VOur organization has three goals.
p266
aVThe first, to prevent mother-to-child transmission.
p267
aVThe second: keep mothers healthy, keep mothers alive,
p268
aVkeep the children alive \u2014
p269
aVno more orphans.
p270
aVAnd the third, and maybe the most grand,
p271
aVis to find ways to empower women,
p272
aVenable them to fight the stigma
p273
aVand to live positive and productive lives with HIV.
p274
aVSo how do we do it?
p275
aVWell, maybe the most important engagement
p276
aVis the one-to-one,
p277
aVseeing patients one-to-one, educating them, supporting them,
p278
aVexplaining how they can take care of themselves.
p279
aVWe go beyond that;
p280
aVwe try to bring in the husbands, the partners.
p281
aVIn Africa, it's very, very hard to engage men.
p282
aVMen are not frequently part of pregnancy care.
p283
aVBut in Rwanda, in one country,
p284
aVthey've got a policy
p285
aVthat a woman can't come for care
p286
aVunless she brings the father of the baby with her \u2014
p287
aVthat's the rule.
p288
aVAnd so the father and the mother, together,
p289
aVgo through the counseling and the testing.
p290
aVThe father and the mother, together, they get the results.
p291
aVAnd this is so important in breaking through the stigma.
p292
aa(lp293
VDisclosure is so central to prevention.
p294
aVHow do you have safer sex, how do you use a condom regularly
p295
aVif there hasn't been disclosure?
p296
aVDisclosure is so important to treatment,
p297
aVbecause again, people need the support of family members and friends
p298
aVto take their medicines regularly.
p299
aVWe also work in groups.
p300
aVNow the groups, it's not like me lecturing,
p301
aVbut what happens is women, they come together \u2014
p302
aVunder the support and guidance of our mentor mothers \u2014
p303
aVthey come together, and they share their personal experiences.
p304
aVAnd it's through the sharing
p305
aVthat people get tactics of how to take care of themselves,
p306
aVhow to disclose how to take medicines.
p307
aVAnd then there's the community outreach,
p308
aVengaging women in their communities.
p309
aVIf we can change the way
p310
aVhouseholds believe and think,
p311
aVwe can change the way communities believe and think.
p312
aVAnd if we can change enough communities,
p313
aVwe can change national attitudes.
p314
aVWe can change national attitudes to women
p315
aVand national attitudes to HIV.
p316
aVThe hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction.
p317
aVWe have the medicines, we have the tests,
p318
aVbut how do you reduce the stigma?
p319
aVAnd it's important about disclosure.
p320
aa(lp321
VSo, a couple years ago, one of the mentor mothers came back,
p322
aVand she told me a story.
p323
aVShe had been asked by one of the clients
p324
aVto go to the home of the client,
p325
aVbecause the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters
p326
aVabout her HIV status,
p327
aVand she was afraid to go by herself.
p328
aVAnd so the mentor mother went along with.
p329
aVAnd the patient walked into the house
p330
aVand said to her mother and siblings,
p331
aV"I have something to tell you. I'm HIV-positive."
p332
aVAnd everybody was quiet.
p333
aVAnd then her oldest brother stood up and said,
p334
aV"I too have something to tell you.
p335
aVI'm HIV-positive.
p336
aVI've been afraid to tell everybody."
p337
aVAnd then this older sister stood up and said,
p338
aV"I too am living with the virus,
p339
aVand I've been ashamed."
p340
aVAnd then her younger brother stood up and said,
p341
aV"I'm also positive.
p342
aVI thought you were going to throw me out of the family."
p343
aVAnd you see where this is going.
p344
aVThe last sister stood up and said, "I'm also positive.
p345
aVI thought you were going to hate me."
p346
aVAnd there they were, all of them together for the first time
p347
aVbeing able to share this experience for the first time
p348
aVand to support each other for the first time.
p349
aa(lp350
V(Video) Female Narrator: Women come to us,
p351
aVand they are crying and scared.
p352
aVI tell them my story,
p353
aVthat I am HIV-positive,
p354
aVbut my child is HIV-negative.
p355
aVI tell them, "You are going to make it,
p356
aVand you will raise a healthy baby."
p357
aVI am proof that there is hope.
p358
aa(lp359
VMitchell Besser: Remember the images I showed you
p360
aVof how few doctors and nurses there are in Africa.
p361
aVAnd it is a crisis in health care systems.
p362
aVEven as we have more tests and more drugs,
p363
aVwe can't reach people; we don't have enough providers.
p364
aVSo we talk in terms of what we call task-shifting.
p365
aVTask-shifting is traditionally
p366
aVwhen you take health care services from one provider
p367
aVand have another provider do it.
p368
aVTypically, it's a doctor giving a job to a nurse.
p369
aVAnd the issue in Africa
p370
aVis that there are fewer nurses, really than doctors,
p371
aVand so we need to find new paradigm for health care.
p372
aVHow do you build a better health care system?
p373
aVWe've chosen to redefine the health care system
p374
aVas a doctor, a nurse and a mentor mother.
p375
aVAnd so what nurses do
p376
aVis that they ask the mentor mothers to explain
p377
aVhow to take the drugs, the side effects.
p378
aVThey delegate education about infant feeding,
p379
aVfamily planning, safer sex,
p380
aVactions that nurses simple just don't have time for.
p381
aa(lp382
VSo we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission.
p383
aVThe world is increasingly seeing these programs
p384
aVas the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health.
p385
aVAnd our organization
p386
aVhelps women across that bridge.
p387
aVThe care doesn't stop when the baby's born \u2014
p388
aVwe deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby,
p389
aVensuring that they live healthy,
p390
aVsuccessful lives.
p391
aa(lp392
VOur organization works on three levels.
p393
aVThe first, at the patient level \u2014
p394
aVmothers and babies keeping babies from getting HIV,
p395
aVkeeping mothers healthy to raise them.
p396
aVThe second, communities \u2014
p397
aVempowering women.
p398
aVThey become leaders within their communities.
p399
aVThey change the way communities think \u2014
p400
aVwe need to change attitudes to HIV.
p401
aVWe need to change attitudes to women in Africa.
p402
aVWe have to do that.
p403
aVAnd then rework the level of the health care systems,
p404
aVbuilding stronger health care systems.
p405
aVOur health care systems are broken.
p406
aVThey're not going to work the way they're currently designed.
p407
aVAnd so doctors and nurses
p408
aVwho need to try to change people's behaviors
p409
aVdon't have the skills, don't have the time \u2014
p410
aVour mentor mothers do.
p411
aVAnd so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in,
p412
aVwe can do that.
p413
aa(lp414
VI started the program in Capetown, South Africa
p415
aVback in 2001.
p416
aVIt was at that point, just the spark of an idea.
p417
aVReferencing Steven Johnson's very lovely speech yesterday
p418
aVon where ideas come from,
p419
aVI was in the shower at the time \u2014
p420
aVI was alone.
p421
aV(Laughter)
p422
aVThe program is now working in nine countries,
p423
aVwe have 670 program sites,
p424
aVwe're seeing about 230,000
p425
aVwomen every month,
p426
aVwe're employing 1,600 mentor mothers,
p427
aVand last year, they enrolled
p428
aV300,000 HIV-positive pregnant women and mothers.
p429
aVThat is 20 percent
p430
aVof the global HIV-positive pregnant women \u2014
p431
aV20 percent of the world.
p432
aVWhat's extraordinary is how simple the premise is.
p433
aVMothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV.
p434
aVPast patients taking care of present patients.
p435
aVAnd empowerment through employment \u2014
p436
aVreducing stigma.
p437
aa(lp438
V(Video) Female Narrator: There is hope,
p439
aVhope that one day
p440
aVwe shall win this fight
p441
aVagainst HIV and AIDS.
p442
aVEach person must know
p443
aVtheir HIV status.
p444
aVThose who are HIV-negative
