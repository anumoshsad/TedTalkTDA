VI want you guys to imagine  that you're a soldier
p4
aVrunning through the battlefield.
p5
aVNow, you're shot in the leg with a bullet,
p6
aVwhich severs your femoral artery.
p7
aVNow, this bleed is extremely traumatic
p8
aVand can kill you in less  than three minutes.
p9
aVUnfortunately, by the time that a medic
p10
aVactually gets to you,
p11
aVwhat the medic has on his or her belt
p12
aVcan take five minutes or more,
p13
aVwith the application of pressure, to stop that type of bleed.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, this problem is  not only a huge problem
p16
aVfor the military, but it's  also a huge problem
p17
aVthat's epidemic throughout  the entire medical field,
p18
aVwhich is how do we actually look at wounds
p19
aVand how do we stop them quickly
p20
aVin a way that can work with the body?
p21
aa(lp22
VSo now, what I've been working on for the last four years
p23
aVis to develop smart biomaterials,
p24
aVwhich are actually materials that will work
p25
aVwith the body, helping it to heal
p26
aVand helping it to allow the  wounds to heal normally.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo now, before we do this, we  have to take a much closer look
p29
aVat actually how does the body work.
p30
aVSo now, everybody here knows
p31
aVthat the body is made up of cells.
p32
aVSo the cell is the most basic unit of life.
p33
aVBut not many people know what else.
p34
aVBut it actually turns out that your cells
p35
aVsit in this mesh of complicated fibers,
p36
aVproteins and sugars
p37
aVknown as the extracellular matrix.
p38
aVSo now, the ECM
p39
aVis actually this mesh that  holds the cells in place,
p40
aVprovides structure for your tissues,
p41
aVbut it also gives the cells a home.
p42
aVIt allows them to feel what they're doing,
p43
aVwhere they are, and tells them
p44
aVhow to act and how to behave.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd it actually turns out that  the extracellular matrix
p47
aVis different from every  single part of the body.
p48
aVSo the ECM in my skin
p49
aVis different than the ECM in my liver,
p50
aVand the ECM in different  parts of the same organ
p51
aVactually vary, so it's very difficult
p52
aVto be able to have a product
p53
aVthat will react to the  local extracellular matrix,
p54
aVwhich is exactly what we're trying to do.
p55
aVSo now, for example,  think of the rainforest.
p56
aVYou have the canopy,  you have the understory,
p57
aVand you have the forest floor.
p58
aVNow, all of these parts of the forest
p59
aVare made up of different plants,
p60
aVand different animals call them home.
p61
aVSo just like that, the extracellular matrix
p62
aVis incredibly diverse in three dimensions.
p63
aVOn top of that, the extracellular matrix
p64
aVis responsible for all wound healing,
p65
aVso if you imagine cutting the body,
p66
aVyou actually have to rebuild
p67
aVthis very complex ECM
p68
aVin order to get it to form again,
p69
aVand a scar, in fact, is actually
p70
aVpoorly formed extracellular matrix.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo now, behind me is an animation
p73
aVof the extracellular matrix.
p74
aVSo as you see, your cells sit  in this complicated mesh
p75
aVand as you move throughout the tissue,
p76
aVthe extracellular matrix changes.
p77
aVSo now every other piece  of technology on the market
p78
aVcan only manage a two- dimensional approximation
p79
aVof the extracellular matrix,
p80
aVwhich means that it doesn't fit in
p81
aVwith the tissue itself.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo when I was a freshman at NYU,
p84
aVwhat I discovered was  you could actually take
p85
aVsmall pieces of plant-derived polymers
p86
aVand reassemble them onto the wound.
p87
aVSo if you have a bleeding  wound like the one behind me,
p88
aVyou can actually put  our material onto this,
p89
aVand just like Lego blocks,
p90
aVit'll reassemble into the local tissue.
p91
aVSo that means if you put it onto liver,
p92
aVit turns into something  that looks like liver,
p93
aVand if you put it onto skin,
p94
aVit turns into something  that looks just like skin.
p95
aVSo when you put the gel on,
p96
aVit actually reassembles  into this local tissue.
p97
aVSo now, this has a whole  bunch of applications,
p98
aVbut basically the idea is, wherever you put this product,
p99
aVyou're able to reassemble  into it immediately.
p100
aa(lp101
VNow, this is a simulated arterial bleed \u2014
p102
aVblood warning \u2014
p103
aVat twice human artery pressure.
p104
aVSo now, this type of bleed  is incredibly traumatic,
p105
aVand like I said before,  would actually take
p106
aVfive minutes or more with pressure
p107
aVto be able to stop.
p108
aVNow, in the time that it takes me to introduce the bleed itself,
p109
aVour material is able to stop that bleed,
p110
aVand it's because it actually  goes on and works
p111
aVwith the body to heal,
p112
aVso it reassembles into this piece of meat,
p113
aVand then the blood actually recognizes
p114
aVthat that's happening,  and produces fibrin,
p115
aVproducing a very fast clot in less than 10 seconds.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo now this technology \u2014 Thank you.
p118
aV(Applause)
p119
aa(lp120
VSo now this technology, by January, will be in the hands of veterinarians,
p121
aVand we're working very diligently to  try to get it into the hands of doctors,
p122
aVhopefully within the next year.
p123
aa(lp124
VBut really, once again, I  want you guys to imagine
p125
aVthat you are a soldier running  through a battlefield.
p126
aVNow, you get hit in the leg with a bullet,
p127
aVand instead of bleeding  out in three minutes,
p128
aVyou pull a small pack  of gel out of your belt,
p129
aVand with the press of a button,
p130
aVyou're able to stop your own bleed
p131
aVand you're on your way to recovery.
p132
aa(lp133
VThank you very much.
