VSo, security is two different things:
p4
aVit's a feeling, and it's a reality.
p5
aVAnd they're different.
p6
aVYou could feel secure even if you're not.
p7
aVAnd you can be secure
p8
aVeven if you don't feel it.
p9
aVReally, we have two separate concepts
p10
aVmapped onto the same word.
p11
aVAnd what I want to do in this talk is to split them apart \u2014
p12
aVfiguring out when they diverge and how they converge.
p13
aVAnd language is actually a problem here.
p14
aVThere aren't a lot of good words
p15
aVfor the concepts we're going to talk about.
p16
aVSo if you look at security from economic terms,
p17
aVit's a trade-off.
p18
aa(lp19
VEvery time you get some security, you're always trading off something.
p20
aVWhether this is a personal decision \u2014
p21
aVwhether you're going to install a burglar alarm in your home \u2014
p22
aVor a national decision,
p23
aVwhere you're going to invade a foreign country \u2014
p24
aVyou're going to trade off something: money or time, convenience, capabilities,
p25
aVmaybe fundamental liberties.
p26
aVAnd the question to ask when you look at a security anything
p27
aVis not whether this makes us safer,
p28
aVbut whether it's worth the trade-off.
p29
aVYou've heard in the past several years, the world is safer
p30
aVbecause Saddam Hussein is not in power.
p31
aVThat might be true, but it's not terribly relevant.
p32
aVThe question is: Was it worth it?
p33
aVAnd you can make your own decision,
p34
aVand then you'll decide whether the invasion was worth it.
p35
aVThat's how you think about security: in terms of the trade-off.
p36
aa(lp37
VNow, there's often no right or wrong here.
p38
aVSome of us have a burglar alarm system at home and some of us don't.
p39
aVAnd it'll depend on where we live,
p40
aVwhether we live alone or have a family,
p41
aVhow much cool stuff we have,
p42
aVhow much we're willing to accept the risk of theft.
p43
aVIn politics also, there are different opinions.
p44
aVA lot of times, these trade-offs are about more than just security,
p45
aVand I think that's really important.
p46
aVNow, people have a natural intuition about these trade-offs.
p47
aVWe make them every day.
p48
aVLast night in my hotel room, when I decided to double-lock the door,
p49
aVor you in your car when you drove here;
p50
aVwhen we go eat lunch
p51
aVand decide the food's not poison and we'll eat it.
p52
aa(lp53
VWe make these trade-offs again and again,
p54
aVmultiple times a day.
p55
aVWe often won't even notice them.
p56
aVThey're just part of being alive; we all do it.
p57
aVEvery species does it.
p58
aVImagine a rabbit in a field, eating grass.
p59
aVAnd the rabbit sees a fox.
p60
aVThat rabbit will make a security trade-off:
p61
aV"Should I stay, or should I flee?"
p62
aVAnd if you think about it,
p63
aVthe rabbits that are good at making that trade-off
p64
aVwill tend to live and reproduce,
p65
aVand the rabbits that are bad at it
p66
aVwill get eaten or starve.
p67
aVSo you'd think
p68
aVthat us, as a successful species on the planet \u2014 you, me, everybody \u2014
p69
aVwould be really good at making these trade-offs.
p70
aVYet it seems, again and again, that we're hopelessly bad at it.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd I think that's a fundamentally interesting question.
p73
aVI'll give you the short answer.
p74
aVThe answer is, we respond to the feeling of security
p75
aVand not the reality.
p76
aVNow, most of the time, that works.
p77
aVMost of the time,
p78
aVfeeling and reality are the same.
p79
aVCertainly that's true for most of human prehistory.
p80
aVWe've developed this ability
p81
aVbecause it makes evolutionary sense.
p82
aVOne way to think of it is that we're highly optimized
p83
aVfor risk decisions
p84
aVthat are endemic to living in small family groups
p85
aVin the East African Highlands in 100,000 BC.
p86
aV2010 New York, not so much.
p87
aVNow, there are several biases in risk perception.
p88
aVA lot of good experiments in this.
p89
aVAnd you can see certain biases that come up again and again.
p90
aVI'll give you four.
p91
aa(lp92
VWe tend to exaggerate spectacular and rare risks
p93
aVand downplay common risks \u2014
p94
aVso, flying versus driving.
p95
aVThe unknown is perceived to be riskier than the familiar.
p96
aVOne example would be:
p97
aVpeople fear kidnapping by strangers,
p98
aVwhen the data supports that kidnapping by relatives is much more common.
p99
aVThis is for children.
p100
aVThird, personified risks are perceived to be greater
p101
aVthan anonymous risks.
p102
aVSo, Bin Laden is scarier because he has a name.
p103
aVAnd the fourth is:
p104
aVpeople underestimate risks in situations they do control
p105
aVand overestimate them in situations they don't control.
p106
aVSo once you take up skydiving or smoking,
p107
aVyou downplay the risks.
p108
aVIf a risk is thrust upon you \u2014 terrorism is a good example \u2014
p109
aVyou'll overplay it,
p110
aVbecause you don't feel like it's in your control.
p111
aa(lp112
VThere are a bunch of other of these cognitive biases,
p113
aVthat affect our risk decisions.
p114
aVThere's the availability heuristic,
p115
aVwhich basically means we estimate the probability of something
p116
aVby how easy it is to bring instances of it to mind.
p117
aVSo you can imagine how that works.
p118
aVIf you hear a lot about tiger attacks, there must be a lot of tigers around.
p119
aVYou don't hear about lion attacks, there aren't a lot of lions around.
p120
aVThis works, until you invent newspapers,
p121
aVbecause what newspapers do is repeat again and again
p122
aVrare risks.
p123
aVI tell people: if it's in the news, don't worry about it,
p124
aVbecause by definition, news is something that almost never happens.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VWhen something is so common, it's no longer news.
p129
aVCar crashes, domestic violence \u2014
p130
aVthose are the risks you worry about.
p131
aVWe're also a species of storytellers.
p132
aVWe respond to stories more than data.
p133
aVAnd there's some basic innumeracy going on.
p134
aVI mean, the joke "One, two, three, many" is kind of right.
p135
aVWe're really good at small numbers.
p136
aVOne mango, two mangoes, three mangoes,
p137
aV10,000 mangoes, 100,000 mangoes \u2014
p138
aVit's still more mangoes you can eat before they rot.
p139
aVSo one half, one quarter, one fifth \u2014 we're good at that.
p140
aVOne in a million, one in a billion \u2014
p141
aVthey're both almost never.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo we have trouble with the risks that aren't very common.
p144
aVAnd what these cognitive biases do
p145
aVis they act as filters between us and reality.
p146
aVAnd the result is that feeling and reality get out of whack,
p147
aVthey get different.
p148
aVNow, you either have a feeling \u2014 you feel more secure than you are,
p149
aVthere's a false sense of security.
p150
aVOr the other way, and that's a false sense of insecurity.
p151
aa(lp152
VI write a lot about "security theater,"
p153
aVwhich are products that make people feel secure,
p154
aVbut don't actually do anything.
p155
aVThere's no real word for stuff that makes us secure,
p156
aVbut doesn't make us feel secure.
p157
aVMaybe it's what the CIA is supposed to do for us.
p158
aVSo back to economics.
p159
aVIf economics, if the market, drives security,
p160
aVand if people make trade-offs based on the feeling of security,
p161
aVthen the smart thing for companies to do for the economic incentives
p162
aVis to make people feel secure.
p163
aVAnd there are two ways to do this.
p164
aa(lp165
VOne, you can make people actually secure
p166
aVand hope they notice.
p167
aVOr two, you can make people just feel secure
p168
aVand hope they don't notice.
p169
aVRight?
p170
aVSo what makes people notice?
p171
aVWell, a couple of things:
p172
aVunderstanding of the security,
p173
aVof the risks, the threats,
p174
aVthe countermeasures, how they work.
p175
aVBut if you know stuff, you're more likely
p176
aVto have your feelings match reality.
p177
aVEnough real-world examples helps.
p178
aVWe all know the crime rate in our neighborhood,
p179
aVbecause we live there, and we get a feeling about it
p180
aVthat basically matches reality.
p181
aVSecurity theater is exposed
p182
aVwhen it's obvious that it's not working properly.
p183
aa(lp184
VOK. So what makes people not notice?
p185
aVWell, a poor understanding.
p186
aVIf you don't understand the risks, you don't understand the costs,
p187
aVyou're likely to get the trade-off wrong,
p188
aVand your feeling doesn't match reality.
p189
aVNot enough examples.
p190
aVThere's an inherent problem with low-probability events.
p191
aVIf, for example, terrorism almost never happens,
p192
aVit's really hard to judge the efficacy of counter-terrorist measures.
p193
aVThis is why you keep sacrificing virgins,
p194
aVand why your unicorn defenses are working just great.
p195
aVThere aren't enough examples of failures.
p196
aVAlso, feelings that cloud the issues \u2014
p197
aVthe cognitive biases I talked about earlier: fears, folk beliefs \u2014
p198
aVbasically, an inadequate model of reality.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo let me complicate things.
p201
aVI have feeling and reality.
p202
aVI want to add a third element. I want to add "model."
p203
aVFeeling and model are in our head,
p204
aVreality is the outside world; it doesn't change, it's real.
p205
aVFeeling is based on our intuition,
p206
aVmodel is based on reason.
p207
aVThat's basically the difference.
p208
aVIn a primitive and simple world,
p209
aVthere's really no reason for a model,
p210
aVbecause feeling is close to reality.
p211
aVYou don't need a model.
p212
aVBut in a modern and complex world,
p213
aVyou need models to understand a lot of the risks we face.
p214
aa(lp215
VThere's no feeling about germs.
p216
aVYou need a model to understand them.
p217
aVThis model is an intelligent representation of reality.
p218
aVIt's, of course, limited by science, by technology.
p219
aVWe couldn't have a germ theory of disease
p220
aVbefore we invented the microscope to see them.
p221
aVIt's limited by our cognitive biases.
p222
aVBut it has the ability to override our feelings.
p223
aVWhere do we get these models? We get them from others.
p224
aVWe get them from religion, from culture, teachers, elders.
p225
aa(lp226
VA couple years ago, I was in South Africa on safari.
p227
aVThe tracker I was with grew up in Kruger National Park.
p228
aVHe had some very complex models of how to survive.
p229
aVAnd it depended on if you were attacked by a lion, leopard, rhino, or elephant \u2014
p230
aVand when you had to run away, when you couldn't run away,
p231
aVwhen you had to climb a tree, when you could never climb a tree.
p232
aVI would have died in a day.
p233
aVBut he was born there, and he understood how to survive.
p234
aVI was born in New York City.
p235
aVI could have taken him to New York, and he would have died in a day.
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VBecause we had different models based on our different experiences.
p240
aVModels can come from the media,
p241
aVfrom our elected officials ...
p242
aVThink of models of terrorism,
p243
aVchild kidnapping,
p244
aVairline safety, car safety.
p245
aVModels can come from industry.
p246
aVThe two I'm following are surveillance cameras,
p247
aVID cards,
p248
aVquite a lot of our computer security models come from there.
p249
aa(lp250
VA lot of models come from science.
p251
aVHealth models are a great example.
p252
aVThink of cancer, bird flu, swine flu, SARS.
p253
aVAll of our feelings of security about those diseases
p254
aVcome from models given to us, really, by science filtered through the media.
p255
aVSo models can change.
p256
aVModels are not static.
p257
aVAs we become more comfortable in our environments,
p258
aVour model can move closer to our feelings.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo an example might be,
p261
aVif you go back 100 years ago,
p262
aVwhen electricity was first becoming common,
p263
aVthere were a lot of fears about it.
p264
aVThere were people who were afraid to push doorbells,
p265
aVbecause there was electricity in there, and that was dangerous.
p266
aVFor us, we're very facile around electricity.
p267
aVWe change light bulbs without even thinking about it.
p268
aVOur model of security around electricity is something we were born into.
p269
aVIt hasn't changed as we were growing up.
p270
aVAnd we're good at it.
p271
aVOr think of the risks on the Internet across generations \u2014
p272
aVhow your parents approach Internet security,
p273
aVversus how you do,
p274
aVversus how our kids will.
p275
aa(lp276
VModels eventually fade into the background.
p277
aV"Intuitive" is just another word for familiar.
p278
aVSo as your model is close to reality and it converges with feelings,
p279
aVyou often don't even know it's there.
p280
aVA nice example of this came from last year and swine flu.
p281
aVWhen swine flu first appeared,
p282
aVthe initial news caused a lot of overreaction.
p283
aVNow, it had a name,
p284
aVwhich made it scarier than the regular flu,
p285
aVeven though it was more deadly.
p286
aVAnd people thought doctors should be able to deal with it.
p287
aVSo there was that feeling of lack of control.
p288
aVAnd those two things made the risk more than it was.
p289
aa(lp290
VAs the novelty wore off and the months went by,
p291
aVthere was some amount of tolerance; people got used to it.
p292
aVThere was no new data, but there was less fear.
p293
aVBy autumn,
p294
aVpeople thought the doctors should have solved this already.
p295
aVAnd there's kind of a bifurcation:
p296
aVpeople had to choose between fear and acceptance \u2014
p297
aVactually, fear and indifference \u2014
p298
aVand they kind of chose suspicion.
p299
aVAnd when the vaccine appeared last winter,
p300
aVthere were a lot of people \u2014 a surprising number \u2014
p301
aVwho refused to get it.
p302
aVAnd it's a nice example of how people's feelings of security change,
p303
aVhow their model changes,
p304
aVsort of wildly,
p305
aVwith no new information, with no new input.
p306
aVThis kind of thing happens a lot.
p307
aa(lp308
VI'm going to give one more complication.
p309
aVWe have feeling, model, reality.
p310
aVI have a very relativistic view of security.
p311
aVI think it depends on the observer.
p312
aVAnd most security decisions have a variety of people involved.
p313
aVAnd stakeholders with specific trade-offs will try to influence the decision.
p314
aVAnd I call that their agenda.
p315
aVAnd you see agenda \u2014 this is marketing, this is politics \u2014
p316
aVtrying to convince you to have one model versus another,
p317
aVtrying to convince you to ignore a model
p318
aVand trust your feelings,
p319
aVmarginalizing people with models you don't like.
p320
aVThis is not uncommon.
p321
aVAn example, a great example, is the risk of smoking.
p322
aVIn the history of the past 50 years,
p323
aVthe smoking risk shows how a model changes,
p324
aVand it also shows how an industry fights against a model it doesn't like.
p325
aa(lp326
VCompare that to the secondhand smoke debate \u2014
p327
aVprobably about 20 years behind.
p328
aVThink about seat belts.
p329
aVWhen I was a kid, no one wore a seat belt.
p330
aVNowadays, no kid will let you drive if you're not wearing a seat belt.
p331
aVCompare that to the airbag debate,
p332
aVprobably about 30 years behind.
p333
aVAll examples of models changing.
p334
aVWhat we learn is that changing models is hard.
p335
aVModels are hard to dislodge.
p336
aVIf they equal your feelings,
p337
aVyou don't even know you have a model.
p338
aVAnd there's another cognitive bias
p339
aVI'll call confirmation bias,
p340
aVwhere we tend to accept data that confirms our beliefs
p341
aVand reject data that contradicts our beliefs.
p342
aVSo evidence against our model, we're likely to ignore,
p343
aVeven if it's compelling.
p344
aVIt has to get very compelling before we'll pay attention.
p345
aa(lp346
VNew models that extend long periods of time are hard.
p347
aVGlobal warming is a great example.
p348
aVWe're terrible at models that span 80 years.
p349
aVWe can do "to the next harvest."
p350
aVWe can often do "until our kids grow up."
p351
aVBut "80 years," we're just not good at.
p352
aVSo it's a very hard model to accept.
p353
aVWe can have both models in our head simultaneously \u2014
p354
aVthat kind of problem where we're holding both beliefs together,
p355
aVthe cognitive dissonance.
p356
aVEventually, the new model will replace the old model.
p357
aa(lp358
VStrong feelings can create a model.
p359
aVSeptember 11 created a security model in a lot of people's heads.
p360
aVAlso, personal experiences with crime can do it,
p361
aVpersonal health scare,
p362
aVa health scare in the news.
p363
aVYou'll see these called "flashbulb events" by psychiatrists.
p364
aVThey can create a model instantaneously,
p365
aVbecause they're very emotive.
p366
aVSo in the technological world,
p367
aVwe don't have experience to judge models.
p368
aVAnd we rely on others. We rely on proxies.
p369
aVAnd this works, as long as it's the correct others.
p370
aa(lp371
VWe rely on government agencies
p372
aVto tell us what pharmaceuticals are safe.
p373
aVI flew here yesterday.
p374
aVI didn't check the airplane.
p375
aVI relied on some other group
p376
aVto determine whether my plane was safe to fly.
p377
aVWe're here, none of us fear the roof is going to collapse on us,
p378
aVnot because we checked,
p379
aVbut because we're pretty sure the building codes here are good.
p380
aVIt's a model we just accept
p381
aVpretty much by faith.
p382
aVAnd that's OK.
p383
aa(lp384
VNow, what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models,
p385
aVhave it reflected in their feelings,
p386
aVto allow them to make security trade-offs.
p387
aVWhen these go out of whack, you have two options.
p388
aVOne, you can fix people's feelings, directly appeal to feelings.
p389
aVIt's manipulation, but it can work.
p390
aVThe second, more honest way
p391
aVis to actually fix the model.
p392
aVChange happens slowly.
p393
aVThe smoking debate took 40 years \u2014 and that was an easy one.
p394
aVSome of this stuff is hard.
p395
aVReally, though, information seems like our best hope.
p396
aa(lp397
VAnd I lied.
p398
aVRemember I said feeling, model, reality; reality doesn't change?
p399
aVIt actually does.
p400
aVWe live in a technological world;
p401
aVreality changes all the time.
p402
aVSo we might have, for the first time in our species:
p403
aVfeeling chases model, model chases reality, reality's moving \u2014
p404
aVthey might never catch up.
p405
aVWe don't know.
p406
aVBut in the long term,
p407
aVboth feeling and reality are important.
p408
aa(lp409
VAnd I want to close with two quick stories to illustrate this.
p410
aV1982 \u2014 I don't know if people will remember this \u2014
p411
aVthere was a short epidemic of Tylenol poisonings
p412
aVin the United States.
p413
aVIt's a horrific story.
p414
aVSomeone took a bottle of Tylenol,
p415
aVput poison in it, closed it up, put it back on the shelf,
p416
aVsomeone else bought it and died.
p417
aVThis terrified people.
p418
aVThere were a couple of copycat attacks.
p419
aVThere wasn't any real risk, but people were scared.
p420
aVAnd this is how the tamper-proof drug industry was invented.
p421
aVThose tamper-proof caps? That came from this.
p422
aVIt's complete security theater.
p423
aVAs a homework assignment, think of 10 ways to get around it.
p424
aVI'll give you one: a syringe.
p425
aVBut it made people feel better.
p426
aVIt made their feeling of security more match the reality.
p427
aa(lp428
VLast story: a few years ago, a friend of mine gave birth.
p429
aVI visit her in the hospital.
p430
aVIt turns out, when a baby's born now,
p431
aVthey put an RFID bracelet on the baby, a corresponding one on the mother,
p432
aVso if anyone other than the mother takes the baby out of the maternity ward,
p433
aVan alarm goes off.
p434
aVI said, "Well, that's kind of neat.
p435
aVI wonder how rampant baby snatching is out of hospitals."
p436
aVI go home, I look it up.
p437
aVIt basically never happens.
p438
aa(lp439
