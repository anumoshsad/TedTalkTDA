VI'd like to begin this song I wrote
p4
aVabout ceaseless yearning and never-ending want
p5
aVwith a poem of popular Petrarchan paradoxes
p6
aVby Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder:
p7
aV"I find no peace, and all my war is done;
p8
aVI fear and hope, I burn and freeze like ice;
p9
aVI fly above the wind,
p10
aVand yet I cannot arise;
p11
aVAnd naught I have,
p12
aVand all the world I seize upon."
