(lp3
VLook, I had second thoughts, really,
p4
aVabout whether I could talk about this
p5
aVto such a vital and alive audience as you guys.
p6
aVThen I remembered the quote from Gloria Steinem,
p7
aVwhich goes,
p8
aV"The truth will set you free,
p9
aVbut first it will piss you off." (Laughter)
p10
aVSo \u2014 (Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VSo with that in mind, I'm going to set about
p13
aVtrying to do those things here,
p14
aVand talk about dying in the 21st century.
p15
aVNow the first thing that will piss you off, undoubtedly,
p16
aVis that all of us are, in fact, going to die
p17
aVin the 21st century.
p18
aVThere will be no exceptions to that.
p19
aVThere are, apparently, about one in eight of you
p20
aVwho think you're immortal, on surveys, but \u2014
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aVUnfortunately, that isn't going to happen.
p23
aa(lp24
VWhile I give this talk, in the next 10 minutes,
p25
aVa hundred million of my cells will die,
p26
aVand over the course of today, 2,000 of my brain cells
p27
aVwill die and never come back,
p28
aVso you could argue that the dying process
p29
aVstarts pretty early in the piece.
p30
aa(lp31
VAnyway, the second thing I want to say about dying in the
p32
aV21st century, apart from it's going to happen to everybody,
p33
aVis it's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck
p34
aVfor most of us,
p35
aVunless we do something to try and reclaim this process
p36
aVfrom the rather inexorable trajectory that it's currently on.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo there you go. That's the truth.
p39
aVNo doubt that will piss you off, and now let's see
p40
aVwhether we can set you free. I don't promise anything.
p41
aVNow, as you heard in the intro, I work in intensive care,
p42
aVand I think I've kind of lived through the heyday
p43
aVof intensive care. It's been a ride, man.
p44
aVThis has been fantastic.
p45
aVWe have machines that go ping.
p46
aVThere's many of them up there.
p47
aVAnd we have some wizard technology which I think
p48
aVhas worked really well, and over the course of the time
p49
aVI've worked in intensive care, the death rate
p50
aVfor males in Australia has halved,
p51
aVand intensive care has had something to do with that.
p52
aVCertainly, a lot of the technologies that we use
p53
aVhave got something to do with that.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo we have had tremendous success, and we kind of
p56
aVgot caught up in our own success quite a bit,
p57
aVand we started using expressions like "lifesaving."
p58
aVI really apologize to everybody for doing that,
p59
aVbecause obviously, we don't.
p60
aVWhat we do is prolong people's lives,
p61
aVand delay death,
p62
aVand redirect death, but we can't, strictly speaking,
p63
aVsave lives on any sort of permanent basis.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd what's really happened over the period of time
p66
aVthat I've been working in intensive care is that
p67
aVthe people whose lives we started saving back in the '70s,
p68
aV'80s, and '90s, are now coming to die in the 21st century
p69
aVof diseases that we no longer have the answers to
p70
aVin quite the way we did then.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo what's happening now is there's been a big shift
p73
aVin the way that people die,
p74
aVand most of what they're dying of now isn't as amenable
p75
aVto what we can do as what it used to be like
p76
aVwhen I was doing this in the '80s and '90s.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo we kind of got a bit caught up with this,
p79
aVand we haven't really squared with you guys about
p80
aVwhat's really happening now, and it's about time we did.
p81
aVI kind of woke up to this bit in the late '90s
p82
aVwhen I met this guy.
p83
aVThis guy is called Jim, Jim Smith, and he looked like this.
p84
aVI was called down to the ward to see him.
p85
aVHis is the little hand.
p86
aVI was called down to the ward to see him
p87
aVby a respiratory physician.
p88
aVHe said, "Look, there's a guy down here.
p89
aVHe's got pneumonia,
p90
aVand he looks like he needs intensive care.
p91
aVHis daughter's here and she wants everything possible
p92
aVto be done."
p93
aVWhich is a familiar phrase to us.
p94
aVSo I go down to the ward and see Jim,
p95
aVand his skin his translucent like this.
p96
aVYou can see his bones through the skin.
p97
aVHe's very, very thin,
p98
aVand he is, indeed, very sick with pneumonia,
p99
aVand he's too sick to talk to me,
p100
aVso I talk to his daughter Kathleen, and I say to her,
p101
aV"Did you and Jim ever talk about
p102
aVwhat you would want done
p103
aVif he ended up in this kind of situation?"
p104
aVAnd she looked at me and said, "No, of course not!"
p105
aVI thought, "Okay. Take this steady."
p106
aVAnd I got talking to her, and after a while, she said to me,
p107
aV"You know, we always thought there'd be time."
p108
aa(lp109
VJim was 94. (Laughter)
p110
aVAnd I realized that something wasn't happening here.
p111
aVThere wasn't this dialogue going on
p112
aVthat I imagined was happening.
p113
aVSo a group of us started doing survey work,
p114
aVand we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home
p115
aVresidents in Newcastle, in the Newcastle area,
p116
aVand discovered that only one in a hundred of them
p117
aVhad a plan about what to do when their hearts stopped beating.
p118
aVOne in a hundred.
p119
aVAnd only one in 500 of them had plan about what to do
p120
aVif they became seriously ill.
p121
aVAnd I realized, of course, this dialogue
p122
aVis definitely not occurring in the public at large.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow, I work in acute care.
p125
aVThis is John Hunter Hospital.
p126
aVAnd I thought, surely, we do better than that.
p127
aVSo a colleague of mine from nursing called Lisa Shaw and I
p128
aVwent through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes
p129
aVin the medical records department
p130
aVlooking at whether there was any sign at all
p131
aVthat anybody had had any conversation about
p132
aVwhat might happen to them if the treatment they were
p133
aVreceiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die.
p134
aVAnd we didn't find a single record of any preference
p135
aVabout goals, treatments or outcomes from any
p136
aVof the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo we started to realize
p139
aVthat we had a problem,
p140
aVand the problem is more serious because of this.
p141
aa(lp142
VWhat we know is that obviously we are all going to die,
p143
aVbut how we die is actually really important,
p144
aVobviously not just to us, but also to how that
p145
aVfeatures in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards.
p146
aVHow we die lives on in the minds of everybody
p147
aVwho survives us, and
p148
aVthe stress created in families by dying is enormous,
p149
aVand in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying
p150
aVin intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else,
p151
aVso dying in intensive care is not your top option
p152
aVif you've got a choice.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd, if that wasn't bad enough, of course,
p155
aVall of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that
p156
aVmany of you, in fact, about one in 10 of you at this point,
p157
aVwill die in intensive care.
p158
aVIn the U.S., it's one in five.
p159
aVIn Miami, it's three out of five people die in intensive care.
p160
aVSo this is the sort of momentum
p161
aVthat we've got at the moment.
p162
aa(lp163
VThe reason why this is all happening is due to this,
p164
aVand I do have to take you through what this is about.
p165
aVThese are the four ways to go.
p166
aVSo one of these will happen to all of us.
p167
aVThe ones you may know most about are the ones
p168
aVthat are becoming increasingly of historical interest:
p169
aVsudden death.
p170
aVIt's quite likely in an audience this size
p171
aVthis won't happen to anybody here.
p172
aVSudden death has become very rare.
p173
aVThe death of Little Nell and Cordelia and all that sort of stuff
p174
aVjust doesn't happen anymore.
p175
aVThe dying process of those with terminal illness
p176
aVthat we've just seen
p177
aVoccurs to younger people.
p178
aVBy the time you've reached 80, this is unlikely to happen to you.
p179
aVOnly one in 10 people who are over 80 will die of cancer.
p180
aa(lp181
VThe big growth industry are these.
p182
aVWhat you die of is increasing organ failure,
p183
aVwith your respiratory, cardiac, renal,
p184
aVwhatever organs packing up. Each of these
p185
aVwould be an admission to an acute care hospital,
p186
aVat the end of which, or at some point during which,
p187
aVsomebody says, enough is enough, and we stop.
p188
aa(lp189
VAnd this one's the biggest growth industry of all,
p190
aVand at least six out of 10 of the people in this room
p191
aVwill die in this form, which is
p192
aVthe dwindling of capacity
p193
aVwith increasing frailty,
p194
aVand frailty's an inevitable part of aging,
p195
aVand increasing frailty is in fact the main thing
p196
aVthat people die of now,
p197
aVand the last few years, or the last year of your life
p198
aVis spent with a great deal of disability, unfortunately.
p199
aa(lp200
VEnjoying it so far? (Laughs)
p201
aV(Laughter)
p202
aVSorry, I just feel such a, I feel such a Cassandra here.
p203
aV(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VWhat can I say that's positive? What's positive is
p206
aVthat this is happening at very great age, now.
p207
aVWe are all, most of us, living to reach this point.
p208
aVYou know, historically, we didn't do that.
p209
aVThis is what happens to you
p210
aVwhen you live to be a great age,
p211
aVand unfortunately, increasing longevity does mean
p212
aVmore old age, not more youth.
p213
aVI'm sorry to say that. (Laughter)
p214
aVWhat we did, anyway, look, what we did,
p215
aVwe didn't just take this lying down
p216
aVat John Hunter Hospital and elsewhere.
p217
aVWe've started a whole series of projects
p218
aVto try and look about whether we could, in fact, involve
p219
aVpeople much more in the way that things happen to them.
p220
aVBut we realized, of course, that we are dealing
p221
aVwith cultural issues,
p222
aVand this is, I love this Klimt painting,
p223
aVbecause the more you look at it, the more you kind of get
p224
aVthe whole issue that's going on here,
p225
aVwhich is clearly the separation of death from the living,
p226
aVand the fear \u2014 Like, if you actually look,
p227
aVthere's one woman there
p228
aVwho has her eyes open.
p229
aVShe's the one he's looking at,
p230
aVand [she's] the one he's coming for. Can you see that?
p231
aVShe looks terrified.
p232
aVIt's an amazing picture.
p233
aa(lp234
VAnyway, we had a major cultural issue.
p235
aVClearly, people didn't want us to talk about death,
p236
aVor, we thought that.
p237
aVSo with loads of funding from the Federal Government
p238
aVand the local Health Service, we introduced a thing
p239
aVat John Hunter called Respecting Patient Choices.
p240
aVWe trained hundreds of people to go to the wards
p241
aVand talk to people about the fact that they would die,
p242
aVand what would they prefer under those circumstances.
p243
aVThey loved it. The families and the patients, they loved it.
p244
aVNinety-eight percent of people really thought
p245
aVthis just should have been normal practice,
p246
aVand that this is how things should work.
p247
aVAnd when they expressed wishes,
p248
aVall of those wishes came true, as it were.
p249
aVWe were able to make that happen for them.
p250
aVBut then, when the funding ran out,
p251
aVwe went back to look six months later,
p252
aVand everybody had stopped again,
p253
aVand nobody was having these conversations anymore.
p254
aVSo that was really kind of heartbreaking for us,
p255
aVbecause we thought this was going to really take off.
p256
aVThe cultural issue had reasserted itself.
p257
aa(lp258
VSo here's the pitch:
p259
aVI think it's important that we don't just get on this freeway
p260
aVto ICU without thinking hard about whether or not
p261
aVthat's where we all want to end up,
p262
aVparticularly as we become older and increasingly frail
p263
aVand ICU has less and less and less to offer us.
p264
aVThere has to be a little side road
p265
aVoff there for people who don't want to go on that track.
p266
aVAnd I have one small idea,
p267
aVand one big idea about what could happen.
p268
aa(lp269
VAnd this is the small idea.
p270
aVThe small idea is, let's all of us
p271
aVengage more with this in the way that Jason has illustrated.
p272
aVWhy can't we have these kinds of conversations
p273
aVwith our own elders
p274
aVand people who might be approaching this?
p275
aVThere are a couple of things you can do.
p276
aVOne of them is, you can,
p277
aVjust ask this simple question. This question never fails.
p278
aV"In the event that you became too sick to speak for yourself,
p279
aVwho would you like to speak for you?"
p280
aVThat's a really important question to ask people,
p281
aVbecause giving people the control over who that is
p282
aVproduces an amazing outcome.
p283
aVThe second thing you can say is,
p284
aV"Have you spoken to that person
p285
aVabout the things that are important to you
p286
aVso that we've got a better idea of what it is we can do?"
p287
aVSo that's the little idea.
p288
aa(lp289
VThe big idea, I think, is more political.
p290
aVI think we have to get onto this.
p291
aVI suggested we should have Occupy Death.
p292
aV(Laughter)
p293
aVMy wife said, "Yeah, right, sit-ins in the mortuary.
p294
aVYeah, yeah. Sure." (Laughter)
p295
aVSo that one didn't really run,
p296
aVbut I was very struck by this.
p297
aVNow, I'm an aging hippie.
p298
aVI don't know, I don't think I look like that anymore, but
p299
aVI had, two of my kids were born at home in the '80s
p300
aVwhen home birth was a big thing, and we baby boomers
p301
aVare used to taking charge of the situation,
p302
aVso if you just replace all these words of birth,
p303
aVI like "Peace, Love, Natural Death" as an option.
p304
aVI do think we have to get political
p305
aVand start to reclaim this process from
p306
aVthe medicalized model in which it's going.
p307
aa(lp308
VNow, listen, that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia.
p309
aVI want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all,
p310
aVI hate euthanasia. I think it's a sideshow.
p311
aVI don't think euthanasia matters.
p312
aVI actually think that,
p313
aVin places like Oregon,
p314
aVwhere you can have physician-assisted suicide,
p315
aVyou take a poisonous dose of stuff,
p316
aVonly half a percent of people ever do that.
p317
aVI'm more interested in what happens to the 99.5 percent
p318
aVof people who don't want to do that.
p319
aVI think most people don't want to be dead,
p320
aVbut I do think most people want to have some control
p321
aVover how their dying process proceeds.
p322
aVSo I'm an opponent of euthanasia,
p323
aVbut I do think we have to give people back some control.
p324
aVIt deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply.
p325
aVI think we should be looking at stopping
p326
aVthe want for euthanasia,
p327
aVnot for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all.
p328
aa(lp329
VThis is a quote from Dame Cicely Saunders,
p330
aVwhom I met when I was a medical student.
p331
aVShe founded the hospice movement.
p332
aVAnd she said, "You matter because you are,
p333
aVand you matter to the last moment of your life."
p334
aVAnd I firmly believe that
p335
aVthat's the message that we have to carry forward.
p336
aVThank you. (Applause)
