VHave you ever heard the one about how breastfeeding is free?
p4
aa(lp5
V(Laughter)
p6
aa(lp7
VYeah, it's pretty funny,
p8
aVbecause it's only free if we don't value women's time and energy.
p9
aVAny mother can tell you how much time and energy it takes
p10
aVto liquify her body \u2014
p11
aVto literally dissolve herself \u2014
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
Vas she feeds this precious little cannibal.
p16

aa(lp19
VMilk is why mammals suck.
p20
aVAt Arizona State University,
p21
aVin the Comparative Lactation Lab,
p22
aVI decode mothers' milk composition
p23
aVto understand its complexity
p24
aVand how it influences infant development.
p25
aVThe most important thing that I've learned
p26
aVis that we do not do enough to support mothers and babies.
p27
aVAnd when we fail mothers and babies,
p28
aVwe fail everyone who loves mothers and babies:
p29
aVthe fathers, the partners, the grandparents, the aunties,
p30
aVthe friends and kin that make our human social networks.
p31
aVIt's time that we abandon simple solutions and simple slogans,
p32
aVand grapple with the nuance.
p33
aa(lp34
VI was very fortunate
p35
aVto run smack-dab into that nuance very early,
p36
aVduring my first interview with a journalist
p37
aVwhen she asked me,
p38
aV"How long should a mother breastfeed her baby?"
p39
aVAnd it was that word "should" that brought me up short,
p40
aVbecause I will never tell a woman what she should do with her body.
p41
aa(lp42
VBabies survive and thrive
p43
aVbecause their mother's milk is food, medicine and signal.
p44
aVFor young infants,
p45
aVmother's milk is a complete diet
p46
aVthat provides all the building blocks for their bodies,
p47
aVthat shapes their brain
p48
aVand fuels all of their activity.
p49
aVMother's milk also feeds the microbes
p50
aVthat are colonizing the infant's intestinal tract.
p51
aVMothers aren't just eating for two,
p52
aVthey're eating for two to the trillions.
p53
aVMilk provides immunofactors that help fight pathogens
p54
aVand mother's milk provides hormones that signal to the infant's body.
p55
aa(lp56
VBut in recent decades,
p57
aVwe have come to take milk for granted.
p58
aVWe stopped seeing something in plain sight.
p59
aVWe began to think of milk as standardized, homogenized, pasteurized,
p60
aVpackaged, powdered, flavored and formulated.
p61
aVWe abandoned the milk of human kindness
p62
aVand turned our priorities elsewhere.
p63
aa(lp64
VAt the National Institutes of Health
p65
aVin Washington DC
p66
aVis the National Library of Medicine,
p67
aVwhich contains 25 million articles \u2014
p68
aVthe brain trust of life science and biomedical research.
p69
aVWe can use keywords to search that database,
p70
aVand when we do that,
p71
aVwe discover nearly a million articles about pregnancy,
p72
aVbut far fewer about breast milk and lactation.
p73
aVWhen we zoom in on the number of articles just investigating breast milk,
p74
aVwe see that we know much more about coffee, wine and tomatoes.
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VWe know over twice as much about erectile dysfunction.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VI'm not saying we shouldn't know about those things \u2014
p83
aVI'm a scientist, I think we should know about everything.
p84
aVBut that we know so much less \u2014
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
Vabout breast milk \u2014
p89
aVthe first fluid a young mammal is adapted to consume \u2014
p90
aVshould make us angry.
p91
aVGlobally, nine out of 10 women will have at least one child in her lifetime.
p92
aVThat means that nearly 130 million babies are born each year.
p93
aVThese mothers and babies deserve our best science.
p94
aa(lp95
VRecent research has shown that milk doesn't just grow the body,
p96
aVit fuels behavior and shapes neurodevelopment.
p97
aVIn 2015, researchers discovered
p98
aVthat the mixture of breast milk and baby saliva \u2014
p99
aVspecifically, baby saliva \u2014
p100
aVcauses a chemical reaction that produces hydrogen peroxide
p101
aVthat can kill staph and salmonella.
p102
aVAnd from humans and other mammal species,
p103
aVwe're starting to understand that the biological recipe of milk
p104
aVcan be different when produced for sons or daughters.
p105
aVWhen we reach for donor milk in the neonatal intensive care unit,
p106
aVor formula on the store shelf,
p107
aVit's nearly one-size-fits-all.
p108
aVWe aren't thinking about how sons and daughters may grow at different rates,
p109
aVor different ways,
p110
aVand that milk may be a part of that.
p111
aa(lp112
VMothers have gotten the message
p113
aVand the vast majority of mothers intend to breastfeed,
p114
aVbut many do not reach their breastfeeding goals.
p115
aVThat is not their failure;
p116
aVit's ours.
p117
aVIncreasingly common medical conditions like obesity, endocrine disorders,
p118
aVC-section and preterm births
p119
aVall can disrupt the underlying biology of lactation.
p120
aVAnd many women do not have knowledgeable clinical support.
p121
aa(lp122
VTwenty-five years ago,
p123
aVthe World Health Organization and UNICEF established criteria
p124
aVfor hospitals to be considered baby friendly \u2014
p125
aVthat provide the optimal level of support for mother-infant bonding
p126
aVand infant feeding.
p127
aVToday, only one in five babies in the United States
p128
aVis born in a baby-friendly hospital.
p129
aVThis is a problem,
p130
aVbecause mothers can grapple with many problems
p131
aVin the minutes, hours, days and weeks of lactation.
p132
aVThey can have struggles with establishing latch,
p133
aVwith pain,
p134
aVwith milk letdown
p135
aVand perceptions of milk supply.
p136
aVThese mothers deserve knowledgeable clinical staff
p137
aVthat understand these processes.
p138
aa(lp139
VMothers will call me as they're grappling with these struggles,
p140
aVcrying with wobbly voices.
p141
aV"It's not working.
p142
aVThis is what I'm supposed to naturally be able to do.
p143
aVWhy is it not working?"
p144
aVAnd just because something is evolutionarily ancient
p145
aVdoesn't mean that it's easy or that we're instantly good at it.
p146
aVYou know what else is evolutionarily ancient?
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VSex.
p151
aVAnd nobody expects us to start out being good at it.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VClinicians best deliver quality equitable care
p156
aVwhen they have continuing education
p157
aVabout how to best support lactation and breastfeeding.
p158
aVAnd in order to have that continuing education,
p159
aVwe need to anchor it to cutting-edge research
p160
aVin both the life sciences and the social sciences,
p161
aVbecause we need to recognize
p162
aVthat too often
p163
aVhistorical traumas and implicit biases
p164
aVsit in the space between a new mother and her clinician.
p165
aVThe body is political.
p166
aVIf our breastfeeding support is not intersectional,
p167
aVit's not good enough.
p168
aVAnd for moms who have to return for work,
p169
aVbecause countries like the United States do not provide paid parental leave,
p170
aVthey can have to go back in as short as just a few days after giving birth.
p171
aa(lp172
VHow do we optimize mother and infant health
p173
aVjust by messaging about breast milk to moms
p174
aVwithout providing the institutional support
p175
aVthat facilitates that mother-infant bonding
p176
aVto support breastfeeding?
p177
aVThe answer is: we can't.
p178
aVI'm talking to you, legislators,
p179
aVand the voters who elect them.
p180
aVI'm talking to you, job creators and collective bargaining units,
p181
aVand workers, and shareholders.
p182
aVWe all have a stake in the public health of our community,
p183
aVand we all have a role to play in achieving it.
p184
aVBreast milk is a part of improving human health.
p185
aVIn the NICU, when infants are born early or sick or injured,
p186
aVmilk or bioactive constituents in milk can be critically important.
p187
aVEnvironments or ecologies,
p188
aVor communities where there's high risk of infectious disease,
p189
aVbreast milk can be incredibly protective.
p190
aVWhere there are emergencies like storms and earthquakes,
p191
aVwhen the electricity goes out,
p192
aVwhen safe water is not available,
p193
aVbreast milk can keep babies fed and hydrated.
p194
aVAnd in the context of humanitarian crises,
p195
aVlike Syrian mothers fleeing war zones,
p196
aVthe smallest drops can buffer babies from the biggest global challenges.
p197
aa(lp198
VBut understanding breast milk is not just about messaging to mothers
p199
aVand policy makers.
p200
aVIt's also about understanding what is important in breast milk
p201
aVso that we can deliver better formulas
p202
aVto moms who cannot or do not breastfeed for whatever reason.
p203
aVWe can all do a better job
p204
aVof supporting the diversity of moms raising their babies
p205
aVin a diversity of ways.
p206
aa(lp207
VAs women around the world struggle
p208
aVto achieve political, social and economic equality,
p209
aVwe must reimagine motherhood
p210
aVas not the central, core aspect of womanhood,
p211
aVbut one of the many potential facets of what makes women awesome.
p212
aa(lp213
VIt's time.
