VG'day, my name's Kevin.
p4
aVI'm from Australia. I'm here to help.
p5
aV(Laughter)
p6
aa(lp7
VTonight, I want to talk about a tale of two cities.
p8
aVOne of those cities is called Washington, and the other is called Beijing.
p9
aVBecause how these two capitals shape their future
p10
aVand the future of the United States and the future of China
p11
aVdoesn't just affect those two countries,
p12
aVit affects all of us
p13
aVin ways, perhaps, we've never thought of:
p14
aVthe air we breathe, the water we drink,
p15
aVthe fish we eat, the quality of our oceans,
p16
aVthe languages we speak in the future,
p17
aVthe jobs we have, the political systems we choose,
p18
aVand, of course, the great questions of war and peace.
p19
aa(lp20
VYou see that bloke? He's French.
p21
aVHis name is Napoleon.
p22
aVA couple of hundred years ago,
p23
aVhe made this extraordinary projection:
p24
aV"China is a sleeping lion, and when she awakes,
p25
aVthe world will shake."
p26
aVNapoleon got a few things wrong;
p27
aVhe got this one absolutely right.
p28
aVBecause China is today not just woken up,
p29
aVChina has stood up and China is on the march,
p30
aVand the question for us all
p31
aVis where will China go
p32
aVand how do we engage this giant of the 21st century?
p33
aa(lp34
VYou start looking at the numbers, they start to confront you in a big way.
p35
aVIt's projected that China will become,
p36
aVby whichever measure \u2014 PPP, market exchange rates \u2014
p37
aVthe largest economy in the world
p38
aVover the course of the decade ahead.
p39
aVThey're already the largest trading nation,
p40
aValready the largest exporting nation,
p41
aValready the largest manufacturing nation,
p42
aVand they're also the biggest emitters of carbon in the world.
p43
aVAmerica comes second.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo if China does become the world's largest economy,
p46
aVthink about this:
p47
aVIt'll be the first time
p48
aVsince this guy was on the throne of England \u2014
p49
aVGeorge III, not a good friend of Napoleon's \u2014
p50
aVthat in the world we will have as the largest economy
p51
aVa non-English speaking country,
p52
aVa non-Western country,
p53
aVa non-liberal democratic country.
p54
aVAnd if you don't think that's going to affect
p55
aVthe way in which the world happens in the future,
p56
aVthen personally, I think you've been smoking something,
p57
aVand it doesn't mean you're from Colorado.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo in short, the question we have tonight is,
p60
aVhow do we understand this mega-change,
p61
aVwhich I believe to be the biggest change for the first half of the 21st century?
p62
aVIt'll affect so many things.
p63
aVIt will go to the absolute core.
p64
aVIt's happening quietly. It's happening persistently.
p65
aVIt's happening in some senses under the radar,
p66
aVas we are all preoccupied with
p67
aVwhat's going in Ukraine, what's going on in the Middle East,
p68
aVwhat's going on with ISIS, what's going on with ISIL,
p69
aVwhat's happening with the future of our economies.
p70
aVThis is a slow and quiet revolution.
p71
aVAnd with a mega-change comes also a mega-challenge,
p72
aVand the mega-challenge is this:
p73
aVCan these two great countries,
p74
aVChina and the United States \u2014
p75
aVChina,
p76
aVthe Middle Kingdom,
p77
aVand the United States,
p78
aVM\u011biguó \u2014
p79
aVwhich in Chinese, by the way, means "the beautiful country."
p80
aVThink about that \u2014 that's the name that China has given this country
p81
aVfor more than a hundred years.
p82
aVWhether these two great civilizations, these two great countries,
p83
aVcan in fact carve out a common future
p84
aVfor themselves and for the world?
p85
aVIn short, can we carve out a future
p86
aVwhich is peaceful and mutually prosperous,
p87
aVor are we looking at a great challenge
p88
aVof war or peace?
p89
aVAnd I have 15 minutes to work through war or peace,
p90
aVwhich is a little less time
p91
aVthan they gave this guy to write a book called "War and Peace."
p92
aa(lp93
VPeople ask me, why is it that a kid growing up in rural Australia
p94
aVgot interested in learning Chinese?
p95
aVWell, there are two reasons for that.
p96
aVHere's the first of them.
p97
aVThat's Betsy the cow.
p98
aVNow, Betsy the cow was one of a herd of dairy cattle
p99
aVthat I grew up with on a farm in rural Australia.
p100
aVSee those hands there? These are not built for farming.
p101
aVSo very early on, I discovered that in fact, working in a farm
p102
aVwas not designed for me, and China was a very safe remove
p103
aVfrom any career in Australian farm life.
p104
aa(lp105
VHere's the second reason.
p106
aVThat's my mom.
p107
aVAnyone here ever listen to what their mom told them to do?
p108
aVEveryone ever do what their mom told them to do?
p109
aVI rarely did,
p110
aVbut what my mom said to me was,
p111
aVone day, she handed me a newspaper,
p112
aVa headline which said, here we have a huge change.
p113
aVAnd that change is China entering the United Nations.
p114
aV1971, I had just turned 14 years of age,
p115
aVand she handed me this headline.
p116
aVAnd she said, "Understand this,  learn this,
p117
aVbecause it's going to affect your future."
p118
aa(lp119
VSo being a very good student of history,
p120
aVI decided that the best thing for me to do was, in fact,
p121
aVto go off and learn Chinese.
p122
aVThe great thing about learning Chinese
p123
aVis that your Chinese teacher gives you a new name.
p124
aVAnd so they gave me this name:
p125
aVKè, which means to overcome or to conquer,
p126
aVand Wén, and that's the character for literature or the arts.
p127
aVKè Wén, Conqueror of the Classics.
p128
aVAny of you guys called "Kevin"?
p129
aVIt's a major lift from being called Kevin to be called Conqueror of the Classics.
p130
aV(Laughter)
p131
aVI've been called Kevin all my life.
p132
aVHave you been called Kevin all your life?
p133
aVWould you prefer to be called Conqueror of the Classics?
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd so I went off after that and joined the Australian Foreign Service,
p136
aVbut here is where pride \u2014 before pride, there always comes a fall.
p137
aVSo there I am in the embassy in Beijing,
p138
aVoff to the Great Hall of the People
p139
aVwith our ambassador, who had asked me to interpret for his first meeting
p140
aVin the Great Hall of the People.
p141
aVAnd so there was I.
p142
aVIf you've been to a Chinese meeting, it's a giant horseshoe.
p143
aVAt the head of the horsehoe are the really serious pooh-bahs,
p144
aVand down the end of the horseshoe are the not-so-serious pooh-bahs,
p145
aVthe junior woodchucks like me.
p146
aVAnd so the ambassador began with this inelegant phrase.
p147
aVHe said, "China and Australia are currently enjoying a relationship
p148
aVof unprecedented closeness."
p149
aVAnd I thought to myself,
p150
aV"That sounds clumsy. That sounds odd.
p151
aVI will improve it."
p152
aVNote to file: Never do that.
p153
aVIt needed to be a little more elegant, a little more classical,
p154
aVso I rendered it as follows.
p155
aV[In Chinese]
p156
aa(lp157
VThere was a big pause on the other side of the room.
p158
aVYou could see the giant pooh-bahs at the head of the horseshoe,
p159
aVthe blood visibly draining from their faces,
p160
aVand the junior woodchucks at the other end of the horseshoe
p161
aVengaged in peals of  unrestrained laughter.
p162
aVBecause when I rendered his sentence,
p163
aV"Australia and China are  enjoying a relationship
p164
aVof unprecedented closeness,"
p165
aVin fact, what I said was that Australia and China
p166
aVwere now experiencing fantastic orgasm.
p167
aV(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VThat was the last time I was asked to interpret.
p170
aVBut in that little story, there's a wisdom, which is,
p171
aVas soon as you think you know something about this extraordinary civilization
p172
aVof 5,000 years of continuing history,
p173
aVthere's always something new to learn.
p174
aa(lp175
VHistory is against us
p176
aVwhen it comes to the U.S. and China
p177
aVforging a common future together.
p178
aVThis guy up here?
p179
aVHe's not Chinese and he's not American.
p180
aVHe's Greek. His name's Thucydides.
p181
aVHe wrote the history of the Peloponnesian Wars.
p182
aVAnd he made this extraordinary observation
p183
aVabout Athens and Sparta.
p184
aV"It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this inspired in Sparta
p185
aVthat made war inevitable."
p186
aVAnd hence, a whole literature about something called the Thucydides Trap.
p187
aa(lp188
VThis guy here? He's not American and he's not Greek. He's Chinese.
p189
aVHis name is Sun Tzu. He wrote "The Art of War,"
p190
aVand if you see his statement underneath, it's along these lines:
p191
aV"Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected."
p192
aVNot looking good so far for China and the United States.
p193
aa(lp194
VThis guy is an American. His name's Graham Allison.
p195
aVIn fact, he's a teacher at the Kennedy School
p196
aVover there in Boston.
p197
aVHe's working on a single project at the moment, which is,
p198
aVdoes the Thucydides Trap about the inevitably of war
p199
aVbetween rising powers and established great powers
p200
aVapply to the future of China-U.S. relations?
p201
aVIt's a core question.
p202
aVAnd what Graham has done is explore 15 cases in history
p203
aVsince the 1500s
p204
aVto establish what the precedents are.
p205
aVAnd in 11 out of 15 of them,
p206
aVlet me tell you,
p207
aVthey've ended in catastrophic war.
p208
aa(lp209
VYou may say, "But Kevin \u2014
p210
aVor Conqueror of the Classics \u2014
p211
aVthat was the past.
p212
aVWe live now in a world of interdependence and globalization.
p213
aVIt could never happen again."
p214
aVGuess what?
p215
aVThe economic historians tell us that in fact,
p216
aVthe time which we reached the greatest point
p217
aVof economic integration and globalization
p218
aVwas in 1914,
p219
aVjust before that happened, World War I,
p220
aVa sobering reflection from history.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo if we are engaged in this great question
p223
aVof how China thinks, feels,
p224
aVand positions itself towards the United States,
p225
aVand the reverse,
p226
aVhow do we get to the baseline
p227
aVof how these two countries and civilizations
p228
aVcan possibly work together?
p229
aa(lp230
VLet me first go to, in fact,
p231
aVChina's views of the U.S. and the rest of the West.
p232
aVNumber one: China feels as if it's been humiliated
p233
aVat the hands of the West through a hundred years of history,
p234
aVbeginning with the Opium Wars.
p235
aVWhen after that, the Western powers carved China up into little pieces,
p236
aVso that by the time it got to the '20s and '30s,
p237
aVsigns like this one appeared on the streets of Shanghai.
p238
aV["No dogs and Chinese allowed"]
p239
aVHow would you feel if you were Chinese,
p240
aVin your own country,  if you saw that sign appear?
p241
aVChina also believes and feels
p242
aVas if, in the events of 1919, at the Peace Conference in Paris,
p243
aVwhen Germany's colonies were given back
p244
aVto all sorts of countries around in the world,
p245
aVwhat about German colonies in China?
p246
aVThey were, in fact, given to Japan.
p247
aVWhen Japan then invaded China in the 1930s
p248
aVthe world looked away and was indifferent to what would happen to China.
p249
aVAnd then, on top of that, the Chinese to this day believe
p250
aVthat the United States and the West
p251
aVdo not accept the legitimacy of their political system
p252
aVbecause it's so radically different from those of us who come
p253
aVfrom liberal democracies,
p254
aVand believe that the United States to this day is seeking
p255
aVto undermine their political system.
p256
aVChina also believes that it is being contained
p257
aVby U.S. allies and by those with strategic partnerships with the U.S.
p258
aVright around its periphery.
p259
aVAnd beyond all that, the Chinese have this feeling
p260
aVin their heart of hearts and in their gut of guts
p261
aVthat those of us in the collective West
p262
aVare just too damned arrogant.
p263
aVThat is, we don't recognize the problems in our own system,
p264
aVin our politics and our economics,
p265
aVand are very quick to point the finger elsewhere,
p266
aVand believe that, in fact, we in the collective West
p267
aVare guilty of a great bunch of hypocrisy.
p268
aa(lp269
VOf course, in international relations,
p270
aVit's not just the sound of one hand clapping.
p271
aVThere's another country too, and that's called the U.S.
p272
aVSo how does the U.S. respond to all of the above?
p273
aVThe U.S. has a response to each of those.
p274
aVOn the question of is the U.S. containing China,
p275
aVthey say, "No, look at the history of the Soviet Union. That was containment."
p276
aVInstead, what we have done in the U.S. and the West
p277
aVis welcome China into the global economy,
p278
aVand on top of that, welcome them into the World Trade Organization.
p279
aVThe U.S. and the West say China cheats
p280
aVon the question of intellectual property rights,
p281
aVand through cyberattacks on U.S. and global firms.
p282
aVFurthermore, the United States says that the Chinese political system
p283
aVis fundamentally wrong
p284
aVbecause it's at such fundamental variance
p285
aVto the human rights, democracy, and rule of law that we enjoy
p286
aVin the U.S. and the collective West.
p287
aVAnd on top of all the above, what does the United States say?
p288
aVThat they fear that China will, when it has sufficient power,
p289
aVestablish a sphere of influence in Southeast Asia and wider East Asia,
p290
aVboot the United States out,
p291
aVand in time, when it's powerful enough,
p292
aVunilaterally seek to change the rules of the global order.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo apart from all of that, it's just fine and dandy,
p295
aVthe U.S.-China relationship.
p296
aVNo real problems there.
p297
aVThe challenge, though, is given those deep-rooted feelings,
p298
aVthose deep-rooted emotions and thought patterns,
p299
aVwhat the Chinese call "S\u012bwéi," ways of thinking,
p300
aVhow can we craft a basis for a common future between these two?
p301
aa(lp302
VI argue simply this:
p303
aVWe can do it on the basis on a framework
p304
aVof constructive realism for a common purpose.
p305
aVWhat do I mean by that?
p306
aVBe realistic about the things that we disagree on,
p307
aVand a management approach that doesn't enable
p308
aVany one of those differences to break into war or conflict
p309
aVuntil we've acquired the diplomatic skills to solve them.
p310
aVBe constructive in areas of the bilateral, regional and global engagement
p311
aVbetween the two,
p312
aVwhich will make a difference for all of humankind.
p313
aVBuild a regional institution capable of cooperation in Asia,
p314
aVan Asia-Pacific community.
p315
aVAnd worldwide, act further,
p316
aVlike you've begun to do at the end of last year
p317
aVby striking out against climate change
p318
aVwith hands joined together rather than fists apart.
p319
aa(lp320
VOf course, all that happens if you've got a common mechanism
p321
aVand political will to achieve the above.
p322
aVThese things are deliverable.
p323
aVBut the question is, are they deliverable alone?
p324
aVThis is what our head tells us we need to do,
p325
aVbut what about our heart?
p326
aa(lp327
VI have a little experience in the question back home
p328
aVof how you try to bring together two peoples
p329
aVwho, frankly, haven't had a whole lot in common in the past.
p330
aVAnd that's when I apologized to Australia's indigenous peoples.
p331
aVThis was a day of reckoning in the Australian government,
p332
aVthe Australian parliament, and for the Australian people.
p333
aVAfter 200 years of unbridled abuse towards the first Australians,
p334
aVit was high time that we white folks said we were sorry.
p335
aa(lp336
VThe important thing \u2014
p337
aV(Applause)
p338
aa(lp339
VThe important thing that I remember is staring in the faces
p340
aVof all those from Aboriginal Australia
p341
aVas they came to listen to this apology.
p342
aVIt was extraordinary to see, for example,
p343
aVold women telling me the stories of when they were five years old
p344
aVand literally ripped away from their parents,
p345
aVlike this lady here.
p346
aVIt was extraordinary for me to then be able to embrace
p347
aVand to kiss Aboriginal elders as they came into the parliament building,
p348
aVand one woman said to me,
p349
aVit's the first time a white fella had ever kissed her in her life,
p350
aVand she was over 70.
p351
aVThat's a terrible story.
p352
aa(lp353
VAnd then I remember this family saying to me,
p354
aV"You know, we drove all the way from the far North down to Canberra
p355
aVto come to this thing,
p356
aVdrove our way through redneck country.
p357
aVOn the way back, stopped at a cafe after the apology for a milkshake."
p358
aVAnd they walked into this cafe quietly, tentatively, gingerly,
p359
aVa little anxious.
p360
aVI think you know what I'm talking about.
p361
aVBut the day after the apology, what happened?
p362
aVEveryone in that cafe, every one of the white folks,
p363
aVstood up and applauded.
p364
aVSomething had happened in the hearts of these people in Australia.
p365
aVThe white folks, our Aboriginal brothers and sisters,
p366
aVand we haven't solved all these problems together,
p367
aVbut let me tell you, there was a new beginning
p368
aVbecause we had gone not just to the head,
p369
aVwe'd gone also to the heart.
p370
aa(lp371
VSo where does that conclude in terms of the great question
p372
aVthat we've been asked to address this evening,
p373
aVwhich is the future of U.S.-China relations?
p374
aVThe head says there's a way forward.
p375
aVThe head says there is a policy framework, there's a common narrative,
p376
aVthere's a mechanism through regular summitry
p377
aVto do these things and to make them better.
p378
aVBut the heart must also find a way to reimagine the possibilities
p379
aVof the America-China relationship,
p380
aVand the possibilities of China's future engagement in the world.
p381
aVSometimes, folks, we just need to take a leap of faith
p382
aVnot quite knowing where we might land.
p383
aa(lp384
VIn China, they now talk about the Chinese Dream.
p385
aVIn America, we're all familiar with the term "the American Dream."
p386
aVI think it's time, across the world,
p387
aVthat we're able to think also of something we might also call
p388
aVa dream for all humankind.
p389
aVBecause if we do that,
p390
aVwe might just change the way
p391
aVthat we think about each other.
p392
aa(lp393
V[In Chinese]
p394
aa(lp395
VThat's my challenge to America. That's my challenge to China.
p396
aVThat's my challenge to all of us,
p397
aVbut I think where there's a will and where there is imagination
p398
aVwe can turn this into a future
p399
aVdriven by peace and prosperity
p400
aVand not once again repeat
p401
aVthe tragedies of war.
p402
aa(lp403
VI thank you.
p404
aa(lp405
V(Applause)
p406
aa(lp407
VChris Anderson: Thanks so much for that. Thanks so much for that.
p408
aVIt feels like you yourself have a role to play in this bridging.
p409
aVYou, in a way, are uniquely placed to speak to both sides.
p410
aa(lp411
VKevin Rudd: Well, what we Australians do best is organize the drinks,
p412
aVso you get them together in one room, and we suggest this and suggest that,
p413
aVthen we go and get the drinks.
p414
aVBut no, look, for all of us who are friends
p415
aVof these two great countries, America and China,
p416
aVyou can do something.
p417
aVYou can make a practical contribution,
p418
aVand for all you good folks here,
p419
aVnext time you meet someone from China,
p420
aVsit down and have a conversation.
p421
aVSee what you can find out about where they come from and what they think,
p422
aVand my challenge for all the Chinese folks
p423
aVwho are going to watch this TED Talk at some time
p424
aVis do the same.
p425
aVTwo of us seeking to change the world can actually make a huge difference.
p426
aVThose of us up the middle, we can make a small contribution.
p427
aa(lp428
