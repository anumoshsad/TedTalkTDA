VI was one of the only kids in college who had a reason
p4
aVto go to the P.O. box at the end of the day,
p5
aVand that was mainly because my mother has never believed
p6
aVin email, in Facebook, in texting or cell phones in general.
p7
aVAnd so while other kids were BBM-ing their parents,
p8
aVI was literally waiting by the mailbox
p9
aVto get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone,
p10
aVwhich was a little frustrating when Grandma was in the hospital,
p11
aVbut I was just looking for some sort of scribble,
p12
aVsome unkempt cursive from my mother.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd so when I moved to New York City after college
p15
aVand got completely sucker-punched in the face by depression,
p16
aVI did the only thing I could think of at the time.
p17
aVI wrote those same kinds of letters that my mother had written me
p18
aVfor strangers, and tucked them all throughout the city,
p19
aVdozens and dozens of them. I left them everywhere,
p20
aVin cafes and in libraries, at the U.N., everywhere.
p21
aVI blogged about those letters and the days
p22
aVwhen they were necessary, and I posed
p23
aVa kind of crazy promise to the Internet:
p24
aVthat if you asked me for a hand-written letter,
p25
aVI would write you one, no questions asked.
p26
aVOvernight, my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak \u2014
p27
aVa single mother in Sacramento, a girl being bullied
p28
aVin rural Kansas, all asking me, a 22-year-old girl
p29
aVwho barely even knew her own coffee order,
p30
aVto write them a love letter and give them a reason
p31
aVto wait by the mailbox.
p32
aa(lp33
VWell, today I fuel a global organization
p34
aVthat is fueled by those trips to the mailbox,
p35
aVfueled by the ways in which we can harness social media
p36
aVlike never before to write and mail strangers letters
p37
aVwhen they need them most, but most of all,
p38
aVfueled by crates of mail like this one, my trusty mail crate,
p39
aVfilled with the scriptings of ordinary people,
p40
aVstrangers writing letters to other strangers not because
p41
aVthey're ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee,
p42
aVbut because they have found one another by way of letter-writing.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut, you know, the thing that always gets me
p45
aVabout these letters is that most of them have been written
p46
aVby people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper.
p47
aVThey could not tell you about the ink of their own love letters.
p48
aVThey're the ones from my generation,
p49
aVthe ones of us that have grown up into a world
p50
aVwhere everything is paperless, and where some
p51
aVof our best conversations have happened upon a screen.
p52
aVWe have learned to diary our pain onto Facebook,
p53
aVand we speak swiftly in 140 characters or less.
p54
aa(lp55
VBut what if it's not about efficiency this time?
p56
aVI was on the subway yesterday with this mail crate,
p57
aVwhich is a conversation starter, let me tell you.
p58
aVIf you ever need one, just carry one of these. (Laughter)
p59
aVAnd a man just stared at me, and he was like,
p60
aV"Well, why don't you use the Internet?"
p61
aVAnd I thought, "Well, sir, I am not a strategist,
p62
aVnor am I specialist. I am merely a storyteller."
p63
aVAnd so I could tell you about a woman
p64
aVwhose husband has just come home from Afghanistan,
p65
aVand she is having a hard time unearthing this thing called conversation,
p66
aVand so she tucks love letters throughout the house
p67
aVas a way to say, "Come back to me.
p68
aVFind me when you can."
p69
aVOr a girl who decides that she is going to leave love letters
p70
aVaround her campus in Dubuque, Iowa, only to find
p71
aVher efforts ripple-effected the next day when she walks out
p72
aVonto the quad and finds love letters hanging
p73
aVfrom the trees, tucked in the bushes and the benches.
p74
aVOr the man who decides that he is going to take his life,
p75
aVuses Facebook as a way to say goodbye
p76
aVto friends and family.
p77
aVWell, tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters
p78
aVjust like this one tucked beneath his pillow,
p79
aVscripted by strangers who were there for him when.
p80
aa(lp81
VThese are the kinds of stories that convinced me
p82
aVthat letter-writing will never again need to flip back her hair
p83
aVand talk about efficiency, because she is an art form now,
p84
aVall the parts of her, the signing, the scripting, the mailing,
p85
aVthe doodles in the margins.
p86
aVThe mere fact that somebody would even just sit down,
p87
aVpull out a piece of paper and think about someone
p88
aVthe whole way through, with an intention that is so much
p89
aVharder to unearth when the browser is up and the iPhone
p90
aVis pinging and we've got six conversations rolling in at once,
p91
aVthat is an art form
p92
aVthat does not fall down to the Goliath of "get faster,"
p93
aVno matter how many social networks we might join.
p94
aVWe still clutch close these letters to our chest,
p95
aVto the words that speak louder than loud,
p96
aVwhen we turn pages into palettes to say the things
p97
aVthat we have needed to say,
p98
aVthe words that we have needed to write, to sisters
p99
aVand brothers and even to strangers, for far too long.
p100
aVThank you. (Applause)
