VI'm going to start on a slightly somber note.
p4
aVTwo thousand and seven, five years ago,
p5
aVmy wife gets diagnosed with breast cancer.
p6
aVStage IIB.
p7
aVNow, looking back, the most harrowing part of that experience
p8
aVwas not just the hospital visits \u2014
p9
aVthese were very painful for my wife, understandably so.
p10
aVIt was not even the initial shock of knowing that she had breast cancer
p11
aVat just 39 years old,
p12
aVabsolutely no history of cancer in her family.
p13
aa(lp14
VThe most horrifying and agonizing part of the whole experience
p15
aVwas we were making decisions after decisions after decisions
p16
aVthat were being thrust upon us.
p17
aVShould it be a mastectomy? Should it be a lumpectomy?
p18
aVShould it be a more aggressive form of treatment,
p19
aVgiven that it was stage IIB?
p20
aVWith all the side effects?
p21
aVOr should it be a less aggressive form of treatment?
p22
aVAnd these were being thrust upon us by the doctors.
p23
aa(lp24
VNow you could ask this question,
p25
aVwhy were the doctors doing this?
p26
aVA simplistic answer would be,
p27
aVthe doctors are doing this
p28
aVbecause they want to protect themselves legally.
p29
aVI think that is too simplistic.
p30
aVThese are well-meaning doctors,
p31
aVsome of them have gone on to become very good friends.
p32
aVThey probably were simply following the wisdom
p33
aVthat has come down through the ages,
p34
aVthis adage that when you're making decisions,
p35
aVespecially decisions of importance,
p36
aVit's best to be in charge, it's best to be in control,
p37
aVit's best to be in the driver's seat.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd we were certainly in the driver's seat,
p40
aVmaking all these decisions.
p41
aVAnd let me tell you \u2014 if some of you have been there,
p42
aVit was a most agonizing and harrowing experience.
p43
aVWhich got me thinking.
p44
aVI said, is there any validity to this whole adage
p45
aVthat when you're making decisions,
p46
aVit's best to take the driver's seat,
p47
aVbe in charge, be in control?
p48
aVOr are there contexts where we're far better off
p49
aVtaking the passenger's seat
p50
aVand have someone else drive?
p51
aVFor example, a trusted financial advisor,
p52
aVcould be a trusted doctor, etc.
p53
aVAnd since I study human decision making,
p54
aVI said, I'm going to run some studies
p55
aVto find some answers.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd I'm going to share one of these studies with you today.
p58
aVSo, imagine that all of you are participants in the study.
p59
aVI want to tell you that what you're going to do in the study is,
p60
aVyou're going to drink a cup of tea.
p61
aVIf you're wondering why, I'll tell you why in a few seconds from now.
p62
aVYou are going to solve a series of puzzles,
p63
aVand I'm going to show you examples of these puzzles momentarily.
p64
aVAnd the more puzzles you solve,
p65
aVthe greater the chances that you'll win some prizes.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow, why do you have to consume the tea?
p68
aVWhy? Because it makes a lot of sense:
p69
aVIn order to solve these puzzles effectively, if you think about it,
p70
aVyour mind needs to be in two states simultaneously, right?
p71
aVIt needs to be alert,
p72
aVfor which caffeine is very good.
p73
aVSimultaneously, it needs to be calm \u2014
p74
aVnot agitated, calm \u2014
p75
aVfor which chamomile is very good.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow comes the between-subjects design,
p78
aVthe AB design, the AB testing.
p79
aVSo what I'm going to do is randomly assign you to one of two groups.
p80
aVSo imagine that there is an imaginary line out here,
p81
aVso everyone here will be group A,
p82
aVeveryone out here will be group B.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow, for you folks, what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you these two teas,
p85
aVand I'll go ahead and ask you to choose your tea.
p86
aVSo you can choose whichever tea you want.
p87
aVYou can decide, what is your mental state:
p88
aVOK, I choose the caffeinated tea,
p89
aVI choose the chamomile tea.
p90
aVSo you're going to be in charge, you're going to be in control,
p91
aVyou're going to be in the driver's seat.
p92
aa(lp93
VYou folks, I'm going to show you these two teas,
p94
aVbut you don't have a choice.
p95
aVI'm going to give you one of these two teas,
p96
aVand keep in mind, I'm going to pick one of these two teas
p97
aVat random for you.
p98
aVAnd you know that.
p99
aVSo if you think about it, this is an extreme-case scenario,
p100
aVbecause in the real world,
p101
aVwhenever you are taking passenger's seat,
p102
aVvery often the driver is going to be someone you trust,
p103
aVan expert, etc.
p104
aVSo this is an extreme-case scenario.
p105
aa(lp106
VNow, you're all going to consume the tea.
p107
aVSo imagine that you're taking the tea now,
p108
aVwe'll wait for you to finish the tea.
p109
aVWe'll give another five minutes for the ingredient to have its effects.
p110
aa(lp111
VNow you're going to have 30 minutes to solve 15 puzzles.
p112
aVHere's an example of the puzzle you're going to solve.
p113
aVAnyone in the audience want to take a stab?
p114
aa(lp115
VAudience member: Pulpit! Baba Shiv: Whoa! OK.
p116
aVThat's cool.
p117
aVYeah, so what we'd do if we had you who gave the answer
p118
aVas a participant,
p119
aVwe would have calibrated the difficulty level
p120
aVof the puzzles to your expertise.
p121
aVBecause we want these puzzles to be difficult.
p122
aVThese are tricky puzzles,
p123
aVbecause your first instinct is to say "tulip."
p124
aVAnd then you have to unstick yourself.
p125
aVRight?
p126
aVSo these have been calibrated to your level of expertise,
p127
aVbecause we want this to be difficult,
p128
aVand I'll tell you why, momentarily.
p129
aa(lp130
VNow, here's another example.
p131
aVAnyone? This is much more difficult.
p132
aa(lp133
VAudience member: Embark. BS: Yeah. Wow! OK.
p134
aVSo, yeah, so this is, again, difficult.
p135
aVYou'll say "kamber," then you'll go, "maker," and all that,
p136
aVand then you can unstick yourself.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo you have 30 minutes now to solve these 15 puzzles.
p139
aVNow, the question we're asking here is, in terms of the outcome \u2014
p140
aVand it comes in the number of puzzles solved \u2014
p141
aVwill you in the driver's seat end up solving more puzzles
p142
aVbecause you are in control,
p143
aVyou could decide which tea you would choose,
p144
aVor would you be better off,
p145
aVin terms of the number of puzzles solved?
p146
aVAnd, systemically, what we will show,
p147
aVacross a series of studies,
p148
aVis that you, the passengers,
p149
aVeven though the tea was picked for you at random,
p150
aVwill end up solving more puzzles than you, the drivers.
p151
aa(lp152
VWe also observe another thing,
p153
aVand that is, you folks not only are solving fewer puzzles,
p154
aVyou're also putting less juice into the task \u2014 less effort,
p155
aVyou're less persistent, and so on.
p156
aVHow do we know that?
p157
aVWell, we have two objective measures.
p158
aVOne is, what is the time, on average, you're taking
p159
aVin attempting to solve these puzzles?
p160
aVYou will spend less time compared to you.
p161
aVSecond, you have 30 minutes to solve these;
p162
aVare you taking the entire 30 minutes
p163
aVor are you giving up before the 30 minutes elapse?
p164
aVYou will be more likely to give up before the 30 minutes elapse,
p165
aVcompared to you.
p166
aVSo you're putting in less juice,
p167
aVand therefore, the outcome: fewer puzzles solved.
p168
aa(lp169
VThat brings us now to: why does this happen?
p170
aVAnd under what situations \u2014 when \u2014 would we see this pattern of results
p171
aVwhere the passenger is going to show better, more favorable outcomes,
p172
aVcompared to the driver?
p173
aa(lp174
VIt all has to do with when you face what I call the INCA.
p175
aVIt's an acronym that stands for the nature of the feedback you're getting
p176
aVafter you made the decision.
p177
aVSo if you think about it, in this particular puzzle task \u2014
p178
aVit could happen in investing in the stock market,
p179
aVvery volatile out there,
p180
aVit could be the medical situation \u2014
p181
aVthe feedback here is immediate.
p182
aVYou know the feedback, whether you're solving the puzzles or not.
p183
aa(lp184
VRight? Second, it is negative.
p185
aVRemember, the deck was stacked against you,
p186
aVin terms of the difficulty level of these puzzles.
p187
aVAnd this can happen in the medical domain.
p188
aVFor example, very early on in the treatment,
p189
aVthings are negative, the feedback, before things become positive.
p190
aVRight? It can happen in the stock market.
p191
aVVolatile stock market, getting negative feedback, it is also immediate.
p192
aVAnd the feedback in all these cases is concrete, it's unambiguous;
p193
aVyou know if you've solved the puzzles or not.
p194
aa(lp195
VNow, the added one,
p196
aVapart from this immediacy, negative, this concreteness \u2014
p197
aVnow you have a sense of agency.
p198
aVYou were responsible for your decision.
p199
aVSo what do you do?
p200
aVYou focus on the foregone option.
p201
aVYou say, you know what?
p202
aVI should have chosen the other tea.
p203
aa(lp204
V(Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VThat casts your decision in doubt,
p207
aVreduces the confidence you have in the decision,
p208
aVthe confidence you have in the performance,
p209
aVthe performance in terms of solving the puzzles.
p210
aVAnd therefore less juice into the task,
p211
aVfewer puzzles solved
p212
aVand less favorable outcomes compared to you folks.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd this can happen in the medical domain, if you think about it, right?
p215
aVA patient in the driver's seat, for example.
p216
aVLess juice, which means keeping herself or himself
p217
aVless physically fit, physically active to hasten the recovery process,
p218
aVwhich is what is often advocated.
p219
aVYou probably wouldn't do that.
p220
aVAnd therefore, there are times when you're facing the INCA,
p221
aVwhen the feedback is going to be immediate, negative, concrete
p222
aVand you have the sense of agency,
p223
aVwhere you're far better off taking the passenger's seat
p224
aVand have someone else drive.
p225
aa(lp226
VNow, I started off on a somber note.
p227
aVI want to finish up on a more upbeat note.
p228
aVIt has now been five years, slightly more than five years,
p229
aVand the good news, thank God, is that the cancer is still in remission.
p230
aa(lp231
VSo it all ends well.
p232
aVBut one thing I didn't mention was that very early on into her treatment,
p233
aVmy wife and I decided that we would take the passenger's seat.
p234
aVAnd that made so much of a difference
p235
aVin terms of the peace of mind that came with that;
p236
aVwe could focus on her recovery.
p237
aVWe let the doctors make all the decisions
p238
aVand take the driver's seat.
p239
aa(lp240
VThank you.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Applause)
