aa(lp20
VAs a kid, I grew up on a farm in Florida,
p21
aVand I did what most little kids do.
p22
aVI played a little baseball, did a few other things like that,
p23
aVbut I always had the sense of being an outsider,
p24
aVand it wasn't until I saw pictures in the magazines
p25
aVthat a couple other guys skate, I thought,
p26
aV"Wow, that's for me," you know?
p27
aVBecause there was no coach standing directly over you,
p28
aVand these guys, they were just being themselves.
p29
aVThere was no opponent directly across from you.
p30
aVAnd I loved that sense, so I started skating
p31
aVwhen I was about 10 years old, in 1977,
p32
aVand when I did, I picked it up pretty quickly.
p33
aVIn fact, here's some footage from about 1984.
p34
aVIt wasn't until 79 I won my first amateur championship,
p35
aVand then, by 81, I was 14, and I won my first world championship,
p36
aVwhich was amazing to me,
p37
aVand in a very real sense, that was the first real victory I had.
p38
aa(lp39
VOh, watch this.
p40
aVThis is a Casper slide, where the board's upside down.
p41
aVMental note on that one.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd this one here?
p46
aVAn ollie.
p47
aVSo, as she mentioned, that is overstated for sure,
p48
aVbut that's why they called me the godfather of modern street skating.
p49
aVHere's some images of that.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow, I was about halfway through my pro career
p52
aVin, I would say, the mid-'80s.
p53
aVFreestyle itself \u2014 we developed all these flat ground tricks, as you saw,
p54
aVbut there was evolving a new kind of skateboarding,
p55
aVwhere guys were taking it to the streets, and they were using that ollie,
p56
aVlike I showed you.
p57
aVThey were using it to get up onto stuff like bleachers and handrails
p58
aVand over stairwells and all kinds of cool stuff.
p59
aVSo it was evolving upwards.
p60
aVIn fact, when someone tells you they're a skater today,
p61
aVthey pretty much mean a street skater,
p62
aVbecause freestyle, it took about five years for it to die,
p63
aVand at that stage, I'd been a "champion" champion for 11 years, which \u2014
p64
aVPhew!
p65
aVAnd suddenly, it was over for me, that's it \u2014 it was gone.
p66
aVThey took my pro model off the shelf,
p67
aVwhich was essentially pronouncing you dead, publicly.
p68
aVThat's how you make your money, you know?
p69
aVYou have a signature board and wheels and shoes and clothes.
p70
aVI had all that stuff, and it's gone.
p71
aa(lp72
VThe crazy thing was, there was a really liberating sense about it,
p73
aVbecause I no longer had to protect my record as a champion.
p74
aV"Champion," again.
p75
aVChampion sounds so goofy, but it's what it was, right?
p76
aVWhat drew me to skateboarding, the freedom,
p77
aVwas now restored, where I could just create things,
p78
aVbecause that's where the joy was for me, always,
p79
aVwas creating new stuff.
p80
aVThe other thing that I had was a deep well of tricks to draw from
p81
aVthat were rooted in these flat ground tricks.
p82
aVStuff the normal guys were doing was very much different.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo, as humbling and rotten as it was \u2014
p85
aVAnd believe me, it was rotten.
p86
aVI would go to skate spots, and I was already "famous guy," right?
p87
aVAnd everyone thought I was good,
p88
aVbut in this new terrain, I was horrible.
p89
aVSo people would go, "Oh, what happened to Mullen?"
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VSo, humbling as it was, I began again.
p94
aVHere are some tricks that I started to bring to that new terrain.
p95
aVAnd again, there's this undergirding layer of influence of freestyle \u2014
p96
aVOh, that one?
p97
aVThat's, like, the hardest thing I've ever done.
p98
aVOK, look at that, it's a Darkslide.
p99
aVSee how it's sliding on the backside?
p100
aVThose are super fun, and, actually, not that hard.
p101
aVYou know, at the very root of that, see, Caspers,
p102
aVsee how you throw it?
p103
aVSimple as that, right? No biggie.
p104
aVAnd your front foot, the way it grabs it \u2014
p105
aVI'd seen someone slide on the back of the board like that,
p106
aVand I was like, "How can I get it over?"
p107
aVBecause that had not yet been done.
p108
aVAnd then it dawned on me, and here's part of what I'm saying.
p109
aVI had an infrastructure. I had this deep layer,
p110
aVwhere it was like, oh my gosh, it's just your foot.
p111
aVIt's just the way you throw your board over.
p112
aVJust let the ledge do that, and it's easy,
p113
aVand the next thing you know, there's 20 more tricks
p114
aVbased out of the variations.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo that's the kind of thing \u2014 here, check this out,
p117
aVhere's another way, and I won't overdo this.
p118
aVA little indulgent, I understand.
p119
aVThere's something called a Primo slide.
p120
aVIt is the funnest trick ever to do.
p121
aVIt's like skimboarding.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd this one, look how it slides sideways, every which way?
p124
aVOK, so when you're skating, and you take a fall,
p125
aVthe board slips that way or that way; it's kind of predictable.
p126
aVThis? It goes every which way \u2014 it's like a cartoon, the falls,
p127
aVand that's what I love the most about it.
p128
aVIt's so much fun to do.
p129
aVIn fact, when I started doing them, I remember, because I got hurt.
p130
aVI had to get a knee surgery, right?
p131
aVSo there were a couple of weeks where I couldn't skate at all.
p132
aVIt would give out on me, and I would watch the guys,
p133
aVI'd go to this warehouse where a lot of the guys were skating,
p134
aVmy friends, and I was like,
p135
aV"I've got to do something new, I want to do something new.
p136
aVI want to start fresh."
p137
aVAnd so the night before my surgery, I'd watched, and I was like,
p138
aV"How am I going to do this?"
p139
aVSo I ran up, and I jumped on my board,
p140
aVand I Cavemanned, and I flipped it down,
p141
aVand I remember thinking, I landed so light-footed, thinking,
p142
aVif my knee gives, they'll just have more work to do in the morning.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd so, when it was the crazy thing.
p147
aVI don't know how many of you guys have had surgery, but \u2014
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
Vyou are so helpless, right?
p152
aVYou're on this gurney and you're watching the ceiling go by,
p153
aVevery time, it's always that,
p154
aVand right when they're putting the mask on you before you go to sleep,
p155
aVall I was thinking is, "Man, when I wake up and I get better,
p156
aVthe first thing I'm going to do is film that trick."
p157
aVAnd indeed I did, it was the very first thing I filmed, which was awesome.
p158
aa(lp159
VI told you a little bit about the evolution of the tricks.
p160
aVConsider that content, in a sense.
p161
aVWhat we do as street skaters is, you have these tricks \u2014
p162
aVSay I'm working on Darkslides, or a Primo,
p163
aVthat you guys know this stuff now.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VWhat you do is, you cruise around the same streets
p168
aVthat you've seen a hundred times,
p169
aVbut suddenly, because you already have something
p170
aVin this fixed domain of this target, it's like, what will match this trick?
p171
aVHow can I expand, how can the context,
p172
aVhow can the environment change the very nature of what I do?
p173
aVSo you drive and drive and drive, and, actually I've got to admit,
p174
aVjust because I was struggling with this because I'm here,
p175
aVbut I'll just say it, is, I cannot tell you,
p176
aVnot only to be here in front of you,
p177
aVbut what a privilege it is to be at US campus,
p178
aVbecause I have been escorted off of this campus so many times.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
V(Applause)
p183
aa(lp184
VSo let me give you another example of how context shapes content.
p185
aVThis is a place not that far from here, It's a rotten neighborhood.
p186
aVYour first consideration is, am I going to get beat up?
p187
aVYou go out and \u2014 See this wall?
p188
aVIt's fairly mellow, and it's beckoning to do bank tricks, right?
p189
aVBut there's this other aspect of it for wheelies,
p190
aVso check this out.
p191
aVThere's a few tricks, again,
p192
aVhow environment changes the nature of your tricks.
p193
aVFreestyle oriented, manual down \u2014 wheelie down.
p194
aVWatch, this one? Oh, I love this, it's like surfing, this one,
p195
aVthe way you catch it.
p196
aVThis one, a little sketchy going backwards,
p197
aVand watch the back foot.
p198
aVOops \u2014
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VMental note right there.
p203
aVAgain, we'll get back to that.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VHere, back foot, back foot.
p208
aVOK, up there?
p209
aVThat was called a 360 flip.
p210
aVNotice how the board flipped and spun this way, both axes.
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd another example of how the context changed,
p213
aVand the creative process for me and for most skaters,
p214
aVis, you go, you get out of the car, you check for security,
p215
aVyou check for stuff.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VIt's funny, you get to know their rhythms, you know,
p220
aVthe guys that cruise around \u2014
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VSkateboarding is such a humbling thing, man.
p225
aVNo matter how good you are, you've still got to deal with \u2014
p226
aVSo you hit this wall, and when I hit it,
p227
aVthe first thing you do is you fall forward,
p228
aVand I'm like, all right, all right.
p229
aVAs you adjust ...
p230
aVyou punch it up, and then when I would do that,
p231
aVit was throwing my shoulder this way ...
p232
aVwhich as I was doing it, I was like, "Oh wow, that's begging for a 360 flip,"
p233
aVbecause that's how you load up for a 360 flip.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd so this is what I want to emphasize that, as you can imagine,
p236
aVall of these tricks are made of submovements,
p237
aVexecutive motor functions,
p238
aVmore granular to the degree to which I can't quite tell you,
p239
aVbut one thing I do know is,
p240
aVevery trick is made of combining two or three or four or five movements.
p241
aVAnd so, as I'm going up, these things are floating around,
p242
aVand you have to sort of let the cognitive mind rest back,
p243
aVpull it back a little bit,
p244
aVand let your intuition go as you feel these things.
p245
aVAnd these submovements are kind of floating around,
p246
aVand as the wall hits you, they connect themselves to an extent,
p247
aVand that's when the cognitive mind: "Oh, 360 flip, I'm going to make that."
p248
aVSo that's how that works to me, the creative process,
p249
aVthe process itself, of street skating.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo, next \u2014 Oh, mind you ...
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
VThose are the community.
p256
aVThese are some of the best skaters in the world.
p257
aVThese are my friends \u2014 oh my gosh, they're such good people.
p258
aVAnd the beauty of skateboarding is that,
p259
aVno one guy is the best.
p260
aVIn fact, I know this is rotten to say, they're my friends,
p261
aVbut a couple of them actually don't look that comfortable on their board.
p262
aVWhat makes them great is the degree to which they use their skateboarding
p263
aVto individuate themselves.
p264
aVEvery single one of these guys, you look at them,
p265
aVyou can see a silhouette of them, and you realize,
p266
aV"Oh, that's him, that's Haslam, that's Koston,
p267
aVthere's these guys, these are the guys."
p268
aa(lp269
VAnd skaters, I think they tend to be outsiders
p270
aVwho seek a sense of belonging,
p271
aVbut belonging on their own terms.
p272
aVAnd real respect is given by how much we take what other guys do,
p273
aVthese basic tricks, 360 flips, we take that, we make it our own,
p274
aVand then we contribute back to the community
p275
aVthe inner way that edifies the community itself.
p276
aVThe greater the contribution,
p277
aVthe more we express and form our individuality,
p278
aVwhich is so important to a lot of us who feel like rejects to begin with.
p279
aVThe summation of that
p280
aVgives us something we could never achieve as an individual.
p281
aVI should say this.
p282
aVThere's some sort of beautiful symmetry
p283
aVthat the degree to which we connect to a community
p284
aVis in proportion to our individuality,
p285
aVwhich we are expressing by what we do.
p286
aa(lp287
VNext,
p288
aVthese guys, very similar community that's extremely conducive to innovation.
p289
aa(lp290
V(Laughter)
p291
aa(lp292
VNotice a couple of these shots from the police department.
p293
aVBut it is quite similar, I mean, what is it to hack, right?
p294
aVIt's knowing a technology so well that you can manipulate it
p295
aVand steer it to do things it was never intended to do, right?
p296
aVAnd they're not all bad.
p297
aVYou can be a Linux kernel hacker, make it more stable, right?
p298
aVMore safe, more secure.
p299
aVYou can be an iOS hacker,
p300
aVmake your iPhone do stuff it wasn't supposed to.
p301
aVNot authorized, but not illegal.
p302
aVAnd then, you've got some of these guys, right?
p303
aVWhat they do is very similar to our creative process.
p304
aVThey connect disparate information,
p305
aVand they bring it together in a way that a security analyst doesn't expect.
p306
aVIt doesn't make them good people,
p307
aVbut it's at the heart of engineering,
p308
aVat the heart of a creative community, an innovative community,
p309
aVand the open source community, the basic ethos of it
p310
aVis, take what other people do, make it better,
p311
aVgive it back so we all rise further.
p312
aVVery similar communities, very similar.
p313
aa(lp314
VWe have our edgier sides, too.
p315
aa(lp316
V(Laughter)
p317
aa(lp318
VIt's funny, my dad was right.
p319
aVThese are my peers.
p320
aVBut I respect what they do, and they respect what I do,
p321
aVbecause they can do things, it's amazing what they can do.
p322
aVIn fact, one of them,
p323
aVhe was Ernst & Young's Entrepreneur of the Year for San Diego County,
p324
aVso they're not \u2014 you never know who you're dealing with.
p325
aa(lp326
VWe've all had some degree of fame.
p327
aVIn fact, I've had so much success that I strangely always feel unworthy of.
p328
aVI've had a patent, and that was cool, and we started a company,
p329
aVand it grew, and it became the biggest,
p330
aVand then it went down, and then it became the biggest again,
p331
aVwhich is harder than the first time, and then we sold it,
p332
aVand then we sold it again.
p333
aVSo I've had some success.
p334
aVAnd in the end, when you've had all of these things,
p335
aVwhat is it that continues to drive you?
p336
aVAs I mentioned, the knee stuff and these things,
p337
aVwhat is it that will punch you?
p338
aVBecause it's not just the mind.
p339
aVWhat is it that will punch you and make you do something
p340
aVand bring it to another level, and when you've had it all,
p341
aVsometimes, guys, they die on the vine with all of that talent,
p342
aVand one of the things we've had, all of us, is fame \u2014
p343
aVI think the best kind of fame, because you can take it off.
p344
aVI've been all around the world,
p345
aVand there will be a thousand kids crying out your name,
p346
aVand it's such a weird, visceral experience.
p347
aVIt's like, it's disorienting.
p348
aVAnd you get in a car, and you drive away,
p349
aVand 10-minute drive, and you get out,
p350
aVand no one gives a rat's who you are.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Laughter)
p353
aa(lp354
VAnd it gives you that clarity of perspective of, man, I'm just me,
p355
aVand popularity, what does that really mean again?
p356
aVNot much.
p357
aVIt's peer respect that drives us.
p358
aVThat's the one thing that makes us do what we do.
p359
aVI've had over a dozen bones, this guy, over, eight, 10 concussions,
p360
aVto the point where it's comedy, right?
p361
aVIt is actually comedy, they mess with him.
p362
aa(lp363
V(Laughter)
p364
aa(lp365
VNext,
p366
aVand this is something deeper.
p367
aVI think I was on tour when I was reading one of the Feynman biographies.
p368
aVIt was the red one or the blue one.
p369
aVAnd he made this statement that was so profound to me.
p370
aVIt was that the Nobel Prize was the tombstone on all great work,
p371
aVand it resonated because I had won 35 out of 36 contests
p372
aVthat I'd entered over 11 years, and it made me bananas.
p373
aVIn fact, winning isn't the word, I won it once.
p374
aVThe rest of the time, you're just defending,
p375
aVand you get into this, turtle posture, you know?
p376
aVWhere you're not doing \u2014 it usurped the joy of what I loved to do
p377
aVbecause I was no longer doing it to create and have fun,
p378
aVand when it died out from under me,
p379
aVthat was one of the most liberating things,
p380
aVbecause I could create.
p381
aa(lp382
VAnd look, I understand that I am on the very edge of preachy, here.
p383
aVI'm not here to do that.
p384
aVIt's just that I'm in front of a very privileged audience.
p385
aVIf you guys aren't already leaders in your community,
p386
aVyou probably will be, and if there's anything I can give you
p387
aVthat will transcend what I've gotten from skateboarding,
p388
aVthe only things of meaning, I think, and of permanence,
p389
aVit's not fame, it's not all these things.
p390
aVWhat it is, is that there's an intrinsic value in creating something
p391
aVfor the sake of creating it,
p392
aVand better than that, because I'm 46 years old, or I'll be 46,
p393
aVand how pathetic is that I'm still skateboarding, but there is \u2014
p394
aVthere is this beauty in dropping it into a community of your own making,
p395
aVand seeing it dispersed, and seeing younger, more talented,
p396
aVjust different talent, take it to levels you can never imagine,
p397
aVbecause that lives on.
p398
aVSo thank you for your time.
p399
aa(lp400
V(Applause)
p401
aa(lp402
VKristina Holly: I have a question for you.
p403
aa(lp404
V(Applause)
p405
aa(lp406
VSo you've really reinvented yourself in the past, from freestyle to street,
p407
aVand, I think it was about four years ago you officially retired.
p408
aVIs that it? What's next?
p409
aa(lp410
VRodney Mullen: That's a good question. KG: Something tells me it's not the end.
p411
aa(lp412
VRM: Yeah. Every time you think you've chased something down,
p413
aVit's funny, no matter how good you are, and I know guys like this,
p414
aVit feels like you're polishing a turd, you know?
p415
aa(lp416
V(Laughter)
p417
aa(lp418
VAnd I thought, the only way I can extend this
p419
aVis to change something infrastructural.
p420
aVAnd so that's what I proceeded to do, through a long story,
p421
aVone of desperation, so if I do it, rather than talk about it,
p422
aVif I do it, you'll be the first to know.
p423
aa(lp424
VKG: All right, we won't ask you any more. RM: You'll get a text.
p425
