VI want to give you a new perspective.
p4
aVThat sounds grandiose, and it is.
p5
aVI left Ireland yesterday morning.
p6
aVI traveled from Dublin to New York
p7
aVindependently.
p8
aVBut the design of an airport,
p9
aVplane and terminal
p10
aVoffers little independence when you're 105 and a half centimeters tall.
p11
aVFor Americans, that's 3' 5".
p12
aVI was whisked through the airport by airline assistants in a wheelchair.
p13
aVNow, I don't need to use a wheelchair,
p14
aVbut the design of an airport
p15
aVand its lack of accessibility
p16
aVmeans that it's my only way to get through.
p17
aVWith my carry-on bag between my feet,
p18
aVI was wheeled through security, preclearance
p19
aVand I arrived at my boarding gate.
p20
aa(lp21
VI use the accessibility services in the airport
p22
aVbecause most of the terminal is just not designed with me in mind.
p23
aVTake security, for example.
p24
aVI'm not strong enough to lift my carry-on bag
p25
aVfrom the ground to the carousel.
p26
aVI stand at eye level with it.
p27
aVAnd those who work in that space for safety purposes cannot help me
p28
aVand cannot do it for me.
p29
aVDesign inhibits my autonomy and my independence.
p30
aVBut traveling at this size, it isn't all bad.
p31
aVThe leg room in economy is like business class.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VI often forget that I'm a little person.
p36
aVIt's the physical environment and society that remind me.
p37
aVUsing a public bathroom is an excruciating experience.
p38
aVI walk into the cubicle
p39
aVbut I can't reach the lock on the door.
p40
aVI'm creative and resilient.
p41
aVI look around and see if there's a bin that I can turn upside down.
p42
aVIs it safe?
p43
aVNot really.
p44
aVIs it hygienic and sanitary?
p45
aVDefinitely not.
p46
aVBut the alternative is much worse.
p47
aVIf that doesn't work, I use my phone.
p48
aVIt gives me an additional four- to six-inch reach,
p49
aVand I try to jam the lock closed with my iPhone.
p50
aVNow, I imagine that's not what Jony Ive had in mind when he designed the iPhone,
p51
aVbut it works.
p52
aVThe alternative is that I approach a stranger.
p53
aVI apologize profusely
p54
aVand I ask them to stand guard outside my cubicle door.
p55
aVThey do
p56
aVand I emerge grateful
p57
aVbut absolutely mortified,
p58
aVand hope that they didn't notice
p59
aVthat I left the bathroom without washing my hands.
p60
aVI carry hand sanitizer with me every single day
p61
aVbecause the sink, soap dispenser, hand dryer and mirror
p62
aVare all out of my reach.
p63
aa(lp64
VNow, the accessible bathroom is somewhat of an option.
p65
aVIn this space, I can reach the lock on the door,
p66
aVthe sink, the soap dispenser, the hand dryer and the mirror.
p67
aVYet, I cannot use the toilet.
p68
aVIt is deliberately designed higher
p69
aVso that wheelchair users can transfer across with ease.
p70
aVThis is a wonderful and necessary innovation,
p71
aVbut in the design world, when we describe a new project or idea as accessible,
p72
aVwhat does that mean?
p73
aVWho is it accessible to?
p74
aVAnd whose needs are not being accommodated for?
p75
aa(lp76
VNow, the bathroom is an example
p77
aVof where design impinges upon my dignity,
p78
aVbut the physical environment impacts upon me in much more casual ways too,
p79
aVsomething as simple as ordering a cup of coffee.
p80
aVNow, I'll admit it.
p81
aVI drink far too much coffee.
p82
aVMy order is a skinny vanilla latte,
p83
aVbut I'm trying to wean myself off the syrup.
p84
aVBut the coffee shop, it's not designed well,
p85
aVat least not for me.
p86
aVQueuing, I'm standing beside the pastry cabinet
p87
aVand the barista calls for the next order.
p88
aV"Next, please!" they shout.
p89
aVThey can't see me.
p90
aVThe person next to me in the queue points to my existence
p91
aVand everyone is embarrassed.
p92
aVI order as quick as I can and I move along to collect my coffee.
p93
aVNow, think just for a second.
p94
aVWhere do they put it?
p95
aVUp high and without a lid.
p96
aVReaching up to collect a coffee that I have paid for
p97
aVis an incredibly dangerous experience.
p98
aa(lp99
VBut design also impinges on the clothes that I want to wear.
p100
aVI want garments that reflect my personality.
p101
aVIt's difficult to find in the childrenswear department.
p102
aVAnd often womenswear requires far too many alterations.
p103
aVI want shoes that affect my maturity, professionalism and sophistication.
p104
aVInstead, I'm offered sneakers with Velcro straps and light-up shoes.
p105
aVNow, I'm not totally opposed to light-up shoes.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Laughter)
p108
aa(lp109
VBut design also impacts on such simple things,
p110
aVlike sitting on a chair.
p111
aVI cannot go from a standing to a seating position with grace.
p112
aVDue to the standards of design heights of chairs,
p113
aVI have to crawl on my hands and knees
p114
aVjust to get on top of it,
p115
aVwhilst also being conscious that it might tip over at any stage.
p116
aa(lp117
VBut whilst design impacts on me
p118
aVwhether it's a chair, a bathroom, a coffee shop, or clothes,
p119
aVI rely on and benefit
p120
aVfrom the kindness of strangers.
p121
aVBut not everybody is so nice.
p122
aVI'm reminded that I'm a little person
p123
aVwhen a stranger points,
p124
aVstares,
p125
aVlaughs,
p126
aVcalls me a name,
p127
aVor takes a photograph of me.
p128
aVThis happens almost every day.
p129
aVWith the rise of social media, it has given me an opportunity
p130
aVand a platform to have a voice as a blogger and as an activist,
p131
aVbut it has also made me nervous
p132
aVthat I might become a meme
p133
aVor a viral sensation,
p134
aVall without my consent.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo let's take a moment right now
p137
aVto make something very clear.
p138
aVThe word "midget" is a slur.
p139
aVIt evolved from PT Barnum's era of circuses and freak shows.
p140
aVSociety has evolved.
p141
aVSo should our vocabulary.
p142
aVLanguage is a powerful tool.
p143
aVIt does not just name our society.
p144
aVIt shapes it.
p145
aa(lp146
VI am incredibly proud to be a little person,
p147
aVto have inherited the condition of achondroplasia.
p148
aVBut I am most proud to be Sinead.
p149
aVAchondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism.
p150
aVAchondroplasia translates as "without cartilage formation."
p151
aVI have short limbs and achondroplastic facial features,
p152
aVmy forehead and my nose.
p153
aVMy arms do not straighten fully,
p154
aVbut I can lick my elbow.
p155
aVI'm not showing you that one.
p156
aVAchondroplasia occurs in approximately one in every 20,000 births.
p157
aV80 percent of little people are born to two average-height parents.
p158
aVThat means that anybody in this room could have a child with achondroplasia.
p159
aVYet, I inherited my condition from my dad.
p160
aVI'd like to show you a photo of my family.
p161
aVMy mother is average height,
p162
aVmy father is a little person
p163
aVand I am the eldest of five children.
p164
aVI have three sisters and one brother.
p165
aVThey are all average height.
p166
aVI am incredibly fortunate to have been born into a family
p167
aVthat cultivated my curiosity and my tenacity,
p168
aVthat protected me from the unkindness and ignorance of strangers
p169
aVand that armed me with the resilience, creativity and confidence
p170
aVthat I needed to survive and manipulate the physical environment and society.
p171
aVIf I was to pinpoint any reason why I am successful,
p172
aVit is because I was and I am a loved child,
p173
aVnow, a loved child with a lot of sass and sarcasm,
p174
aVbut a loved child nonetheless.
p175
aa(lp176
VIn giving you an insight into who I am today
p177
aVI wanted to offer you a new perspective.
p178
aVI wanted to challenge the idea
p179
aVthat design is but a tool to create function and beauty.
p180
aVDesign greatly impacts upon people's lives,
p181
aVall lives.
p182
aVDesign is a way in which we can feel included in the world,
p183
aVbut it is also a way in which we can uphold a person's dignity
p184
aVand their human rights.
p185
aVDesign can also inflict vulnerability
p186
aVon a group whose needs aren't considered.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo today, I want your perceptions challenged.
p189
aVWho are we not designing for?
p190
aVHow can we amplify their voices
p191
aVand their experiences?
p192
aVWhat is the next step?
p193
aVDesign is an enormous privilege,
p194
aVbut it is a bigger responsibility.
p195
aVI want you to open your eyes.
p196
aa(lp197
VThank you so much.
