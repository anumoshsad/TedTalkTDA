VThe technology likely to have the greatest impact
p4
aVon the next few decades
p5
aVhas arrived.
p6
aVAnd it's not social media.
p7
aVIt's not big data.
p8
aVIt's not robotics.
p9
aVIt's not even AI.
p10
aVYou'll be surprised to learn
p11
aVthat it's the underlying technology of digital currencies like Bitcoin.
p12
aVIt's called the blockchain. Blockchain.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow, it's not the most sonorous word in the world,
p15
aVbut I believe that this is now
p16
aVthe next generation of the internet,
p17
aVand that it holds vast promise for every business, every society
p18
aVand for all of you, individually.
p19
aa(lp20
VYou know, for the past few decades, we've had the internet of information.
p21
aVAnd when I send you an email or a PowerPoint file or something,
p22
aVI'm actually not sending you the original,
p23
aVI'm sending you a copy.
p24
aVAnd that's great.
p25
aVThis is democratized information.
p26
aVBut when it comes to assets \u2014
p27
aVthings like money,
p28
aVfinancial assets like stocks and bonds,
p29
aVloyalty points, intellectual property,
p30
aVmusic, art, a vote,
p31
aVcarbon credit and other assets \u2014
p32
aVsending you a copy is a really bad idea.
p33
aVIf I send you 100 dollars,
p34
aVit's really important that I don't still have the money \u2014
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
Vand that I can't send it to you.
p39
aVThis has been called the "double-spend" problem
p40
aVby cryptographers for a long time.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo today, we rely entirely on big intermediaries \u2014
p43
aVmiddlemen like banks, government,
p44
aVbig social media companies, credit card companies and so on \u2014
p45
aVto establish trust in our economy.
p46
aVAnd these intermediaries perform all the business and transaction logic
p47
aVof every kind of commerce,
p48
aVfrom authentication, identification of people,
p49
aVthrough to clearing, settling and record keeping.
p50
aVAnd overall, they do a pretty good job.
p51
aVBut there are growing problems.
p52
aa(lp53
VTo begin, they're centralized.
p54
aVThat means they can be hacked, and increasingly are \u2014
p55
aVJP Morgan, the US Federal Government,
p56
aVLinkedIn, Home Depot and others
p57
aVfound that out the hard way.
p58
aVThey exclude billions of people from the global economy,
p59
aVfor example, people who don't have enough money
p60
aVto have a bank account.
p61
aVThey slow things down.
p62
aVIt can take a second for an email to go around the world,
p63
aVbut it can take days or weeks
p64
aVfor money to move through the banking system across a city.
p65
aVAnd they take a big piece of the action \u2014
p66
aV10 to 20 percent just to send money to another country.
p67
aVThey capture our data,
p68
aVand that means we can't monetize it
p69
aVor use it to better manage our lives.
p70
aVOur privacy is being undermined.
p71
aVAnd the biggest problem is that overall,
p72
aVthey've appropriated the largesse of the digital age asymmetrically:
p73
aVwe have wealth creation, but we have growing social inequality.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo what if there were not only an internet of information,
p76
aVwhat if there were an internet of value \u2014
p77
aVsome kind of vast, global, distributed ledger
p78
aVrunning on millions of computers
p79
aVand available to everybody.
p80
aVAnd where every kind of asset, from money to music,
p81
aVcould be stored, moved, transacted, exchanged and managed,
p82
aVall without powerful intermediaries?
p83
aVWhat if there were a native medium for value?
p84
aa(lp85
VWell, in 2008, the financial industry crashed
p86
aVand, perhaps propitiously,
p87
aVan anonymous person or persons named Satoshi Nakamoto
p88
aVcreated a paper where he developed a protocol for a digital cash
p89
aVthat used an underlying cryptocurrency called Bitcoin.
p90
aVAnd this cryptocurrency enabled people to establish trust and do transactions
p91
aVwithout a third party.
p92
aVAnd this seemingly simple act set off a spark
p93
aVthat ignited the world,
p94
aVthat has everyone excited or terrified or otherwise interested
p95
aVin many places.
p96
aVNow, don't be confused about Bitcoin \u2014
p97
aVBitcoin is an asset; it goes up and down,
p98
aVand that should be of interest to you if you're a speculator.
p99
aVMore broadly, it's a cryptocurrency.
p100
aVIt's not a fiat currency controlled by a nation-state.
p101
aVAnd that's of greater interest.
p102
aVBut the real pony here is the underlying technology.
p103
aVIt's called blockchain.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo for the first time now in human history,
p106
aVpeople everywhere can trust each other
p107
aVand transact peer to peer.
p108
aVAnd trust is established, not by some big institution,
p109
aVbut by collaboration, by cryptography
p110
aVand by some clever code.
p111
aVAnd because trust is native to the technology,
p112
aVI call this, "The Trust Protocol."
p113
aa(lp114
VNow, you're probably wondering: How does this thing work?
p115
aVFair enough.
p116
aVAssets \u2014 digital assets like money to music and everything in between \u2014
p117
aVare not stored in a central place,
p118
aVbut they're distributed across a global ledger,
p119
aVusing the highest level of cryptography.
p120
aVAnd when a transaction is conducted,
p121
aVit's posted globally,
p122
aVacross millions and millions of computers.
p123
aVAnd out there, around the world,
p124
aVis a group of people called "miners."
p125
aVThese are not young people, they're Bitcoin miners.
p126
aVThey have massive computing power at their fingertips \u2014
p127
aV10 to 100 times bigger than all of Google worldwide.
p128
aVThese miners do a lot of work.
p129
aVAnd every 10 minutes,
p130
aVkind of like the heartbeat of a network,
p131
aVa block gets created
p132
aVthat has all the transactions from the previous 10 minutes.
p133
aVThen the miners get to work, trying to solve some tough problems.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd they compete:
p136
aVthe first miner to find out the truth and to validate the block,
p137
aVis rewarded in digital currency,
p138
aVin the case of the Bitcoin blockchain, with Bitcoin.
p139
aVAnd then \u2014 this is the key part \u2014
p140
aVthat block is linked to the previous block
p141
aVand the previous block
p142
aVto create a chain of blocks.
p143
aVAnd every one is time-stamped,
p144
aVkind of like with a digital waxed seal.
p145
aVSo if I wanted to go and hack a block
p146
aVand, say, pay you and you with the same money,
p147
aVI'd have to hack that block,
p148
aVplus all the preceding blocks,
p149
aVthe entire history of commerce on that blockchain,
p150
aVnot just on one computer but across millions of computers,
p151
aVsimultaneously,
p152
aVall using the highest levels of encryption,
p153
aVin the light of the most powerful computing resource in the world
p154
aVthat's watching me.
p155
aVTough to do.
p156
aVThis is infinitely more secure
p157
aVthan the computer systems that we have today.
p158
aVBlockchain. That's how it works.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo the Bitcoin blockchain is just one.
p161
aVThere are many.
p162
aVThe Ethereum blockchain was developed by a Canadian named Vitalik Buterin.
p163
aVHe's [22] years old,
p164
aVand this blockchain has some extraordinary capabilities.
p165
aVOne of them is that you can build smart contracts.
p166
aVIt's kind of what it sounds like.
p167
aVIt's a contract that self-executes,
p168
aVand the contract handles the enforcement, the management, performance
p169
aVand payment \u2014 the contract kind of has a bank account, too, in a sense \u2014
p170
aVof agreements between people.
p171
aVAnd today, on the Ethereum blockchain,
p172
aVthere are projects underway to do everything
p173
aVfrom create a new replacement for the stock market
p174
aVto create a new model of democracy,
p175
aVwhere politicians are accountable to citizens.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Applause)
p178
aa(lp179
VSo to understand what a radical change this is going to bring,
p180
aVlet's look at one industry, financial services.
p181
aVRecognize this?
p182
aVRube Goldberg machine.
p183
aVIt's a ridiculously complicated machine that does something really simple,
p184
aVlike crack an egg or shut a door.
p185
aVWell, it kind of reminds me of the financial services industry,
p186
aVhonestly.
p187
aVI mean, you tap your card in the corner store,
p188
aVand a bitstream goes through a dozen companies,
p189
aVeach with their own computer system,
p190
aVsome of them being 1970s mainframes
p191
aVolder than many of the people in this room,
p192
aVand three days later, a settlement occurs.
p193
aVWell, with a blockchain financial industry,
p194
aVthere would be no settlement,
p195
aVbecause the payment and the settlement is the same activity,
p196
aVit's just a change in the ledger.
p197
aVSo Wall Street and all around the world,
p198
aVthe financial industry is in a big upheaval about this,
p199
aVwondering, can we be replaced,
p200
aVor how do we embrace this technology for success?
p201
aa(lp202
VNow, why should you care?
p203
aVWell, let me describe some applications.
p204
aVProsperity.
p205
aVThe first era of the internet,
p206
aVthe internet of information,
p207
aVbrought us wealth but not shared prosperity,
p208
aVbecause social inequality is growing.
p209
aVAnd this is at the heart of all of the anger and extremism
p210
aVand protectionism and xenophobia and worse
p211
aVthat we're seeing growing in the world today,
p212
aVBrexit being the most recent case.
p213
aa(lp214
VSo could we develop some new approaches to this problem of inequality?
p215
aVBecause the only approach today is to redistribute wealth,
p216
aVtax people and spread it around more.
p217
aVCould we pre-distribute wealth?
p218
aVCould we change the way that wealth gets created in the first place
p219
aVby democratizing wealth creation,
p220
aVengaging more people in the economy,
p221
aVand then ensuring that they got fair compensation?
p222
aVLet me describe five ways that this can be done.
p223
aa(lp224
VNumber one:
p225
aVDid you know that 70 percent of the people in the world who have land
p226
aVhave a tenuous title to it?
p227
aVSo, you've got a little farm in Honduras, some dictator comes to power,
p228
aVhe says, "I know you've got a piece of paper that says you own your farm,
p229
aVbut the government computer says my friend owns your farm."
p230
aVThis happened on a mass scale in Honduras,
p231
aVand this problem exists everywhere.
p232
aVHernando de Soto, the great Latin American economist,
p233
aVsays this is the number one issue in the world
p234
aVin terms of economic mobility,
p235
aVmore important than having a bank account,
p236
aVbecause if you don't have a valid title to your land,
p237
aVyou can't borrow against it,
p238
aVand you can't plan for the future.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo today, companies are working with governments
p241
aVto put land titles on a blockchain.
p242
aVAnd once it's there, this is immutable.
p243
aVYou can't hack it.
p244
aVThis creates the conditions for prosperity
p245
aVfor potentially billions of people.
p246
aa(lp247
VSecondly:
p248
aVa lot of writers talk about Uber
p249
aVand Airbnb and TaskRabbit and Lyft and so on
p250
aVas part of the sharing economy.
p251
aVThis is a very powerful idea,
p252
aVthat peers can come together and create and share wealth.
p253
aVMy view is that ...
p254
aVthese companies are not really sharing.
p255
aVIn fact, they're successful precisely because they don't share.
p256
aVThey aggregate services together, and they sell them.
p257
aVWhat if, rather than Airbnb being a $25 billion corporation,
p258
aVthere was a distributed application on a blockchain, we'll call it B-Airbnb,
p259
aVand it was essentially owned by all of the people
p260
aVwho have a room to rent.
p261
aVAnd when someone wants to rent a room,
p262
aVthey go onto the blockchain database and all the criteria,
p263
aVthey sift through, it helps them find the right room,
p264
aVand then the blockchain helps with the contracting,
p265
aVit identifies the party,
p266
aVit handles the payments
p267
aVjust through digital payments \u2014 they're built into the system.
p268
aVAnd it even handles reputation,
p269
aVbecause if she rates a room as a five-star room,
p270
aVthat room is there,
p271
aVand it's rated, and it's immutable.
p272
aVSo, the big sharing-economy disruptors in Silicon Valley
p273
aVcould be disrupted,
p274
aVand this would be good for prosperity.
p275
aa(lp276
VNumber three:
p277
aVthe biggest flow of funds from the developed world
p278
aVto the developing world
p279
aVis not corporate investment,
p280
aVand it's not even foreign aid.
p281
aVIt's remittances.
p282
aVThis is the global diaspora;
p283
aVpeople have left their ancestral lands,
p284
aVand they're sending money back to their families at home.
p285
aVThis is 600 billion dollars a year, and it's growing,
p286
aVand these people are getting ripped off.
p287
aa(lp288
VAnalie Domingo is a housekeeper.
p289
aVShe lives in Toronto,
p290
aVand every month she goes to the Western Union office
p291
aVwith some cash
p292
aVto send her remittances to her mom in Manila.
p293
aVIt costs her around 10 percent;
p294
aVthe money takes four to seven days to get there;
p295
aVher mom never knows when it's going to arrive.
p296
aVIt takes five hours out of her week to do this.
p297
aa(lp298
VSix months ago,
p299
aVAnalie Domingo used a blockchain application called Abra.
p300
aVAnd from her mobile device, she sent 300 bucks.
p301
aVIt went directly to her mom's mobile device
p302
aVwithout going through an intermediary.
p303
aVAnd then her mom looked at her mobile device \u2014
p304
aVit's kind of like an Uber interface, there's Abra "tellers" moving around.
p305
aVShe clicks on a teller that's a five-star teller,
p306
aVwho's seven minutes away.
p307
aVThe guy shows up at the door, gives her Filipino pesos,
p308
aVshe puts them in her wallet.
p309
aVThe whole thing took minutes,
p310
aVand it cost her two percent.
p311
aVThis is a big opportunity for prosperity.
p312
aa(lp313
VNumber four: the most powerful asset of the digital age is data.
p314
aVAnd data is really a new asset class,
p315
aVmaybe bigger than previous asset classes,
p316
aVlike land under the agrarian economy,
p317
aVor an industrial plant,
p318
aVor even money.
p319
aVAnd all of you \u2014 we \u2014 create this data.
p320
aVWe create this asset,
p321
aVand we leave this trail of digital crumbs behind us
p322
aVas we go throughout life.
p323
aVAnd these crumbs are collected into a mirror image of you,
p324
aVthe virtual you.
p325
aVAnd the virtual you may know more about you than you do,
p326
aVbecause you can't remember what you bought a year ago,
p327
aVor said a year ago, or your exact location a year ago.
p328
aVAnd the virtual you is not owned by you \u2014
p329
aVthat's the big problem.
p330
aa(lp331
VSo today, there are companies working
p332
aVto create an identity in a black box,
p333
aVthe virtual you owned by you.
p334
aVAnd this black box moves around with you
p335
aVas you travel throughout the world,
p336
aVand it's very, very stingy.
p337
aVIt only gives away the shred of information
p338
aVthat's required to do something.
p339
aVA lot of transactions,
p340
aVthe seller doesn't even need to know who you are.
p341
aVThey just need to know that they got paid.
p342
aa(lp343
VAnd then this avatar is sweeping up all of this data
p344
aVand enabling you to monetize it.
p345
aVAnd this is a wonderful thing,
p346
aVbecause it can also help us protect our privacy,
p347
aVand privacy is the foundation of a free society.
p348
aVLet's get this asset that we create
p349
aVback under our control,
p350
aVwhere we can own our own identity
p351
aVand manage it responsibly.
p352
aa(lp353
VFinally \u2014
p354
aa(lp355
V(Applause)
p356
aa(lp357
VFinally, number five:
p358
aVthere are a whole number of creators of content
p359
aVwho don't receive fair compensation,
p360
aVbecause the system for intellectual property is broken.
p361
aVIt was broken by the first era of the internet.
p362
aVTake music.
p363
aVMusicians are left with crumbs at the end of the whole food chain.
p364
aVYou know, if you were a songwriter, 25 years ago, you wrote a hit song,
p365
aVit got a million singles,
p366
aVyou could get royalties of around 45,000 dollars.
p367
aVToday, you're a songwriter, you write a hit song,
p368
aVit gets a million streams,
p369
aVyou don't get 45k,
p370
aVyou get 36 dollars,
p371
aVenough to buy a nice pizza.
p372
aa(lp373
VSo Imogen Heap,
p374
aVthe Grammy-winning singer-songwriter,
p375
aVis now putting music on a blockchain ecosystem.
p376
aVShe calls it "Mycelia."
p377
aVAnd the music has a smart contract surrounding it.
p378
aVAnd the music protects her intellectual property rights.
p379
aVYou want to listen to the song?
p380
aVIt's free, or maybe a few micro-cents that flow into a digital account.
p381
aVYou want to put the song in your movie, that's different,
p382
aVand the IP rights are all specified.
p383
aVYou want to make a ringtone? That's different.
p384
aVShe describes that the song becomes a business.
p385
aVIt's out there on this platform marketing itself,
p386
aVprotecting the rights of the author,
p387
aVand because the song has a payment system
p388
aVin the sense of bank account,
p389
aVall the money flows back to the artist,
p390
aVand they control the industry,
p391
aVrather than these powerful intermediaries.
p392
aVNow, this is \u2014
p393
aa(lp394
V(Applause)
p395
aa(lp396
VThis is not just songwriters,
p397
aVit's any creator of content,
p398
aVlike art,
p399
aVlike inventions,
p400
aVscientific discoveries, journalists.
p401
aVThere are all kinds of people who don't get fair compensation,
p402
aVand with blockchains,
p403
aVthey're going to be able to make it rain on the blockchain.
p404
aVAnd that's a wonderful thing.
p405
aa(lp406
VSo, these are five opportunities
p407
aVout of a dozen
p408
aVto solve one problem, prosperity,
p409
aVwhich is one of countless problems
p410
aVthat blockchains are applicable to.
p411
aa(lp412
VNow, technology doesn't create prosperity, of course \u2014 people do.
p413
aVBut my case to you is that, once again,
p414
aVthe technology genie has escaped from the bottle,
p415
aVand it was summoned by an unknown person or persons
p416
aVat this uncertain time in human history,
p417
aVand it's giving us another kick at the can,
p418
aVanother opportunity to rewrite the economic power grid
p419
aVand the old order of things,
p420
aVand solve some of the world's most difficult problems,
p421
aVif we will it.
p422
