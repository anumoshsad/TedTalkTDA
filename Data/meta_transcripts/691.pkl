VOne morning, in the year 1957,
p4
aVthe neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield
p5
aVsaw himself like this,
p6
aVa weird freak with huge hands,
p7
aVhuge mouth,
p8
aVand a tiny bottom.
p9
aVActually this creature
p10
aVis the result of the Penfield research.
p11
aVHe named it homunculus.
p12
aVBasically the homunculus is
p13
aVthe visualization of a human being
p14
aVwhere each part of the body is proportional
p15
aVto the surface it takes in the brain.
p16
aVSo, of course, homunculus is definitely not a freak.
p17
aVIt's you. It's me.
p18
aVIt's our invisible reality.
p19
aVThis visualization could explain, for example,
p20
aVwhy newborns, or smokers,
p21
aVput, instinctively, their fingers in the mouth.
p22
aVUnfortunately it doesn't explain why
p23
aVso many designers remain mainly interested
p24
aVin designing chairs.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo anyway, even if I do not understand science entirely,
p27
aVfor my design I essentially refer to it.
p28
aVI'm fascinated by its ability to
p29
aVdeeply investigate the human being,
p30
aVits way of working, its way of feeling.
p31
aVAnd it really helps me to understand
p32
aVhow we see, how we hear,
p33
aVhow we breathe, how our brain can inform or mislead us.
p34
aVIt's a great tool for me
p35
aVto understand what could be our real needs.
p36
aa(lp37
VMarketing people have never been able to do that.
p38
aVMarketing reduces things. Marketing simplifies.
p39
aVMarketing creates user groups.
p40
aVAnd scientists, amidst complexity,
p41
aVamidst fluctuation and uniqueness.
p42
aVWhat could be our real needs?
p43
aVMaybe the silence.
p44
aVIn our daily life we are continuously disturbed by
p45
aVaggressive sounds.
p46
aVAnd you know all those kind of sound puts us
p47
aVin a kind of stressful state,
p48
aVand prevent us from being quiet and focused.
p49
aVSo I wanted to create a kind of
p50
aVsound filter,
p51
aVable to preserve ourselves from noise pollution.
p52
aVBut I didn't want it to make it by
p53
aVisolating people, without any earmuffs
p54
aVor those kind of things.
p55
aVOr neither with including complex technology.
p56
aVI just wanted to, using the complexity
p57
aVand the technology of the brain, of the human brain.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo I worked with white noise.
p60
aVdB is basically \u2014
p61
aVdB is the name of the product,
p62
aVbasically a white noise diffuser.
p63
aVThis is white noise.
p64
aVThe white noise is the sum of all frequencies
p65
aVthat are audible by the human being,
p66
aVbrought to the same intensity.
p67
aVAnd this noise is like a "shhhhhhhhhhhhh," like that.
p68
aVAnd this noise is the most neutral.
p69
aVIt is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain.
p70
aVSo when you hear this sound
p71
aVyou feel like a kind of shelter,
p72
aVpreserved from noise pollution.
p73
aVAnd when you hear the white noise, your brain is immediately focused on it.
p74
aVAnd do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound.
p75
aVIt seems to be magic.
p76
aVBut it is just physiology. It's just in your brain.
p77
aVAnd in mine, I hope.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo in order to make this white noise
p80
aVa little bit active and reactive,
p81
aVI create a ball, a rolling ball
p82
aVable to analyze and find
p83
aVwhere does aggressive sound come from,
p84
aVand roll, at home or at work,
p85
aVtowards aggressive noise,
p86
aVand emits white noise in order to neutralize it.
p87
aV(Laughter)
p88
aVIt works.
p89
aVYou feel the effect of the white noise?
p90
aVIt's too in silence.
p91
aVIf you make some noise you can feel the effect.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo even if this object,
p94
aVeven if this product includes some technology,
p95
aVit includes some speakers, it includes some microphones
p96
aVand some electronic devices,
p97
aVthis object is not a very smart object.
p98
aVAnd I don't want to make a very smart object.
p99
aVI don't want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot.
p100
aVI want to create an object like you and me.
p101
aVSo, definitely not perfect.
p102
aVSo imagine, for instance, you are at home.
p103
aVA loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend.
p104
aVYou shout. You say, "Blah blah blah, Blah blah blah. Who is this guy?"
p105
aVAnd dB will probably roll toward you.
p106
aVAnd turning around you is "shhhhhhh," like that.
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aVDefinitely not perfect. So you would probably
p109
aVshut it, at this point.
p110
aV(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VAnyway, in this same kind of approach,
p113
aVI designed K.
p114
aVK is a daylight receiver transmitter.
p115
aVSo this object is supposed to be displayed on your desk,
p116
aVor on your piano, where you are supposed
p117
aVto spend most of your time in the day.
p118
aVAnd this object will be
p119
aVable to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day,
p120
aVand able to give you the quantity of light you need.
p121
aVThis object is completely covered by
p122
aVfiber opticals.
p123
aVAnd the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object, for sure,
p124
aVbut creates the idea of an
p125
aVeye sensibility of the object.
p126
aVI want, by this design
p127
aVfeel, when you see it,
p128
aVyou see, instinctively,
p129
aVthis object seems to be very sensitive,
p130
aVvery reactive.
p131
aVAnd this object knows, better than you
p132
aVand probably before you, what you really need.
p133
aVYou have to know that the lack of daylight
p134
aVcan provoke some
p135
aVproblem of energy, or problem of libido.
p136
aVSo, a huge problem.
p137
aV(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VMost of the projects I work on \u2014
p140
aVI live in collaboration with scientists.
p141
aVI'm just a designer. So I need them.
p142
aVSo there can be some biologists,
p143
aVpsychiatrists, mathematicians, and so on.
p144
aVAnd I submit them, my intuitions,
p145
aVmy hypothesis, my first ideas.
p146
aVAnd they react. They told me what is possible, what is impossible.
p147
aVAnd together we improve the original concept.
p148
aVAnd we build the project to the end.
p149
aVAnd this kind of relationship between designer and scientist
p150
aVstarted when I was at school.
p151
aa(lp152
VIndeed in my studies I was a guinea pig
p153
aVfor a pharmaceutical industry.
p154
aVAnd the irony for me was
p155
aVof course, I didn't do that for the sake of science progress.
p156
aVI just do that to make money.
p157
aVAnyway, this project, or this experience,
p158
aVmake me start a new project on the design of medicine.
p159
aVYou have to know that today, roughly one or two every drug pills
p160
aVis not taken correctly.
p161
aVSo even if the active constituents
p162
aVin pharmaceuticals made constant progress
p163
aVin terms of chemistry, target of stability,
p164
aVthe behavior of the patients
p165
aVgoes more and more unstable.
p166
aVSo we took too many of them.
p167
aVWe took irregular dosage.
p168
aVWe do not follow instructions. And so on.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo I wanted to create a
p171
aVnew kind of medicine,
p172
aVin order to create a new kind of relationship
p173
aVbetween the patient and the treatment.
p174
aVSo I turned traditional pills into this.
p175
aVI'm going to give you some example.
p176
aVThis one is an antibiotic.
p177
aVAnd its purpose is to help patient
p178
aVto go to the end of the treatment.
p179
aVAnd the concept is to
p180
aVcreate a kind of onion,
p181
aVa kind of structure in layers.
p182
aVSo, you start with the darkest one.
p183
aVAnd you are helped to visualize the duration of the treatment.
p184
aVAnd you are helped to visualize the decrease of the infection.
p185
aVSo the first day, this is the big one.
p186
aVAnd you have to peel and eat one layer a day.
p187
aVAnd your antibiotic goes smaller and clearer.
p188
aVAnd you're waiting for recovery as you were waiting for the Christmas day.
p189
aVAnd you follow the treatment like that,
p190
aVto the end of the treatment.
p191
aVAnd here you can get the white core.
p192
aVAnd it means, right, you are in the recovery.
p193
aV(Applause) Thank you.
p194
aa(lp195
VThis one is a "third lung,"
p196
aVa pharmaceutical device for long-term asthma treatment.
p197
aVI designed it to help kids to follow the treatment.
p198
aVSo the idea of this one is to create
p199
aVa relationship between the patient of the treatment
p200
aVbut a relationship of dependency.
p201
aVBut in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient.
p202
aVThis is, the kids will feel
p203
aVthe therapeutic object needs him.
p204
aVSo the idea is, all night long
p205
aVthe elastic skin of the third lung
p206
aVwill slowly inflate itself,
p207
aVincluding air and molecules, for sure.
p208
aVAnd when the kids wake up,
p209
aVhe can see the object needs him. And he take him to his mouth,
p210
aVand breathe the air it contains.
p211
aVSo by this way,
p212
aVthe kid, to take care of himself,
p213
aVis to take care of this living object.
p214
aVAnd he does not feel anymore it's relies on asthma treatment,
p215
aVas the asthma treatment needs him.
p216
aV(Applause)
p217
aa(lp218
VIn this guise of living object approach,
p219
aVI like the idea of a kind of invisible design,
p220
aVas if the function of the object
p221
aVexists in a kind of invisible field
p222
aVjust around the objects themselves.
p223
aVWe could talk about a kind of soul,
p224
aVof a ghost accompanying them.
p225
aVAnd almost a kind of poltergeist effect.
p226
aVSo when a passive object like this one seems to be alive,
p227
aVbecause it is \u2014 woosh \u2014 starting to move.
p228
aa(lp229
VAnd I remember an exhibition design
p230
aVI made for John Maeda,
p231
aVand for the Fondation Cartier in Paris.
p232
aVAnd John Maeda was supposed to show
p233
aVseveral graphic animations in this exhibition.
p234
aVAnd my idea for this exhibition design was to create
p235
aVa real pong game, like this one.
p236
aVAnd the idea was to create some self-moving benches
p237
aVin the main exhibition room.
p238
aVSo the living benches would be exactly like the ball.
p239
aVAnd John was so excited by this idea. He said to me, "Okay let's go."
p240
aVI remember the day of the opening.
p241
aVI was a little bit late.
p242
aVWhen I bring the 10 living and self-moving benches
p243
aVin the exhibition room, John was just beside me,
p244
aVand was like, "Hmm. Hmm."
p245
aVAnd he told me, after a long silence,
p246
aV"I wonder, Mathieu, if
p247
aVpeople won't be more fascinated by your benches
p248
aVthan by my videos."
p249
aV(Laughter)
p250
aVIt would be a great honor, a great compliment for me,
p251
aVif he hadn't decided to take all them off
p252
aVtwo hours before the opening.
p253
aVSo, huge tragedy.
p254
aa(lp255
VI guess you won't be surprised if I tell you
p256
aVthat Pinocchio is one of my great influences.
p257
aVPinocchio is probably one of my best design products, my favorite one.
p258
aVBecause it is a kind of object with a conscience,
p259
aVable to be modified by its surroundings,
p260
aVand able to modify it as well.
p261
aVThe other great influence is the mine's canary.
p262
aVIn coal mines, this canary
p263
aVwas supposed to be close to the miners.
p264
aVAnd it was singing all day long. And when it stops it means that it just died.
p265
aVSo this canary was a living alarm,
p266
aVand a very efficient one.
p267
aVA very natural technology,
p268
aVin order to say to the miners,
p269
aV"The air is too bad. You have to go. It's an emergency."
p270
aVSo it's, for me, a great product.
p271
aa(lp272
VAnd I tried to design a kind of canary.
p273
aVAndrea is one.
p274
aVAndrea is a living air filter that absorbs toxic gasses
p275
aVfrom air, contaminated indoor air.
p276
aVSo it uses some plants to do this job,
p277
aVselected for their gas-filtering ability.
p278
aVYou have to know, or you probably already know,
p279
aVthat indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one.
p280
aVSo while I'm talking to you,
p281
aVthe seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some
p282
aVinvisible and odorless toxic gas. Sorry for that. (Laughter)
p283
aVSo you are currently breathing formaldehyde.
p284
aVIt's the same for me with the carpet.
p285
aVAnd this is exactly the same at home.
p286
aVBecause all the product we get constantly give away
p287
aVthe volatile component of which they're made of.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo let's have a look at your home.
p290
aVSo your sofa, your plastic chair,
p291
aVyour kid's toys
p292
aVgive their own invisible reality. And this one is very toxic.
p293
aVThis is the reason why
p294
aVI created, with David Edward,
p295
aVa scientist of Harvard University,
p296
aVan object able to absorb the toxic elements using those kind of plants.
p297
aVBut the idea is to force
p298
aVthe air to go in the effective part of the plants.
p299
aVBecause the roots of the plant are not very effective.
p300
aVBill Wolverton from NASA
p301
aVanalyzed it cleverly in the '70s.
p302
aVSo the idea is to create an object
p303
aVable to force the air, and to be in contact at the right speed
p304
aVat the right place, in all the effective parts of the plant.
p305
aVSo this is the final object.
p306
aVIt will be launched next September.
p307
aV(Applause)
p308
aa(lp309
VThis one is kind of the same approach
p310
aVbecause I include, in a product
p311
aVlike Andrea, some plants.
p312
aVAnd in this one, plants are used for the water filtration ability.
p313
aVAnd it includes some fishes as well.
p314
aVBut here, unlike Andrea,
p315
aVhere are supposed to be eaten.
p316
aVIndeed, this object is a domestic farm,
p317
aVfor fishes and green.
p318
aVSo the idea of this object
p319
aVis to be able to get at home
p320
aVvery local food.
p321
aVThe locavores
p322
aVused to get food
p323
aVtaken in a radius of 100 miles.
p324
aVLocal River is able to provide you
p325
aVfood directly in your living room.
p326
aVSo the principle of this object
p327
aVis to create an ecosystem
p328
aVcalled aquaponics.
p329
aVAnd the aquaponics is the dirty water of the fish,
p330
aVby a water pump, feeds the plants above.
p331
aVAnd the plants will filter, by the roots,
p332
aVthe dirty water of the fish.
p333
aVAfter, it goes back into the fish tank.
p334
aa(lp335
VAfter that you have two options.
p336
aVOr you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your TV set.
p337
aVAmazing channel.
p338
aVOr you start fishing.
p339
aVAnd you make some sushis with a fish
p340
aVand the aromatic plants above.
p341
aVBecause you can grow some potatoes.
p342
aVNo, not potatoes, but tomatoes,
p343
aVaromatic plants and so on.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo now we can breathe safely.
p346
aVNow we can eat local food.
p347
aVNow we can be treated by smart medicine.
p348
aVNow we can be well-balanced in our biorhythm
p349
aVwith daylight.
p350
aVBut it was important to create a perfect place,
p351
aVso I tried to,
p352
aVin order to work and create.
p353
aVSo I designed, for an American scientist based in Paris,
p354
aVa very stimulative, brain-stimulative office.
p355
aVI wanted to create a perfect place
p356
aVwhere you can work and play,
p357
aVand where your body and your brain can work together.
p358
aa(lp359
VSo, in this office,
p360
aVyou do not work anymore at your desk, like a politician.
p361
aVYour seat, your sleep and your play
p362
aVon a big geodesic island made of leather.
p363
aVSee, like this one?
p364
aVIn this office you do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper,
p365
aVbut you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave,
p366
aVlike a prehistoric scientist.
p367
aVSo you, like that, can make some sport during your work.
p368
aVIn this office
p369
aVyou do not need to go out
p370
aVin order to be in contact with nature.
p371
aVYou include, directly, the nature in the floor of the office.
p372
aVYou can see it there.
p373
aa(lp374
VThis is an inspiration image
p375
aVto lead this project of the office.
p376
aVIt really helped me to design it.
p377
aVI never show it to my client. He would be so afraid.
p378
aV(Laughter)
p379
aVJust for my workshop.
p380
aVI guess it may be the revenge of the guinea pig I was.
p381
aVBut it's maybe the conviction
p382
aVas monkey and homunculus we are.
p383
aVAll of us need to be considered according to our real nature.
p384
aVThank you very much.
