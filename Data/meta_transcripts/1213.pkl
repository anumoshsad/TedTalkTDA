VWhat I want to talk to you about
p4
aVis what we can learn from studying the genomes
p5
aVof living people
p6
aVand extinct humans.
p7
aVBut before doing that,
p8
aVI just briefly want to remind you about what you already know:
p9
aVthat our genomes, our genetic material,
p10
aVare stored in almost all cells in our bodies in chromosomes
p11
aVin the form of DNA,
p12
aVwhich is this famous double-helical molecule.
p13
aVAnd the genetic information
p14
aVis contained in the form of a sequence
p15
aVof four bases
p16
aVabbreviated with the letters A, T, C and G.
p17
aVAnd the information is there twice \u2014
p18
aVone on each strand \u2014
p19
aVwhich is important,
p20
aVbecause when new cells are formed, these strands come apart,
p21
aVnew strands are synthesized with the old ones as templates
p22
aVin an almost perfect process.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut nothing, of course, in nature
p25
aVis totally perfect,
p26
aVso sometimes an error is made
p27
aVand a wrong letter is built in.
p28
aVAnd we can then see the result
p29
aVof such mutations
p30
aVwhen we compare DNA sequences
p31
aVamong us here in the room, for example.
p32
aVIf we compare my genome to the genome of you,
p33
aVapproximately every 1,200, 1,300 letters
p34
aVwill differ between us.
p35
aVAnd these mutations accumulate
p36
aVapproximately as a function of time.
p37
aVSo if we add in a chimpanzee here, we will see more differences.
p38
aVApproximately one letter in a hundred
p39
aVwill differ from a chimpanzee.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd if you're then interested in the history
p42
aVof a piece of DNA, or the whole genome,
p43
aVyou can reconstruct the history of the DNA
p44
aVwith those differences you observe.
p45
aVAnd generally we depict our ideas about this history
p46
aVin the form of trees like this.
p47
aVIn this case, it's very simple.
p48
aVThe two human DNA sequences
p49
aVgo back to a common ancestor quite recently.
p50
aVFarther back is there one shared with chimpanzees.
p51
aVAnd because these mutations
p52
aVhappen approximately as a function of time,
p53
aVyou can transform these differences
p54
aVto estimates of time,
p55
aVwhere the two humans, typically,
p56
aVwill share a common ancestor about half a million years ago,
p57
aVand with the chimpanzees,
p58
aVit will be in the order of five million years ago.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo what has now happened in the last few years
p61
aVis that there are account technologies around
p62
aVthat allow you to see many, many pieces of DNA very quickly.
p63
aVSo we can now, in a matter of hours,
p64
aVdetermine a whole human genome.
p65
aVEach of us, of course, contains two human genomes \u2014
p66
aVone from our mothers and one from our fathers.
p67
aVAnd they are around three billion such letters long.
p68
aVAnd we will find that the two genomes in me,
p69
aVor one genome of mine we want to use,
p70
aVwill have about three million differences
p71
aVin the order of that.
p72
aVAnd what you can then also begin to do
p73
aVis to say, "How are these genetic differences
p74
aVdistributed across the world?"
p75
aVAnd if you do that,
p76
aVyou find a certain amount of genetic variation in Africa.
p77
aVAnd if you look outside Africa,
p78
aVyou actually find less genetic variation.
p79
aVThis is surprising, of course,
p80
aVbecause in the order of six to eight times fewer people
p81
aVlive in Africa than outside Africa.
p82
aVYet the people inside Africa
p83
aVhave more genetic variation.
p84
aa(lp85
VMoreover, almost all these genetic variants
p86
aVwe see outside Africa
p87
aVhave closely related DNA sequences
p88
aVthat you find inside Africa.
p89
aVBut if you look in Africa,
p90
aVthere is a component of the genetic variation
p91
aVthat has no close relatives outside.
p92
aVSo a model to explain this
p93
aVis that a part of the African variation, but not all of it,
p94
aV[has] gone out and colonized the rest of the world.
p95
aVAnd together with the methods to date these genetic differences,
p96
aVthis has led to the insight
p97
aVthat modern humans \u2014
p98
aVhumans that are essentially indistinguishable from you and me \u2014
p99
aVevolved in Africa, quite recently,
p100
aVbetween 100 and 200,000 years ago.
p101
aVAnd later, between 100 and 50,000 years ago or so,
p102
aVwent out of Africa
p103
aVto colonize the rest of the world.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo what I often like to say
p106
aVis that, from a genomic perspective,
p107
aVwe are all Africans.
p108
aVWe either live inside Africa today,
p109
aVor in quite recent exile.
p110
aVAnother consequence
p111
aVof this recent origin of modern humans
p112
aVis that genetic variants
p113
aVare generally distributed widely in the world,
p114
aVin many places,
p115
aVand they tend to vary as gradients,
p116
aVfrom a bird's-eye perspective at least.
p117
aVAnd since there are many genetic variants,
p118
aVand they have different such gradients,
p119
aVthis means that if we determine a DNA sequence \u2014
p120
aVa genome from one individual \u2014
p121
aVwe can quite accurately estimate
p122
aVwhere that person comes from,
p123
aVprovided that its parents or grandparents
p124
aVhaven't moved around too much.
p125
aa(lp126
VBut does this then mean,
p127
aVas many people tend to think,
p128
aVthat there are huge genetic differences between groups of people \u2014
p129
aVon different continents, for example?
p130
aVWell we can begin to ask those questions also.
p131
aVThere is, for example, a project that's underway
p132
aVto sequence a thousand individuals \u2014
p133
aVtheir genomes \u2014 from different parts of the world.
p134
aVThey've sequenced 185 Africans
p135
aVfrom two populations in Africa.
p136
aV[They've] sequenced approximately equally [as] many people
p137
aVin Europe and in China.
p138
aVAnd we can begin to say how much variance do we find,
p139
aVhow many letters that vary
p140
aVin at least one of those individual sequences.
p141
aVAnd it's a lot: 38 million variable positions.
p142
aa(lp143
VBut we can then ask: Are there any absolute differences
p144
aVbetween Africans and non-Africans?
p145
aVPerhaps the biggest difference
p146
aVmost of us would imagine existed.
p147
aVAnd with absolute difference \u2014
p148
aVand I mean a difference
p149
aVwhere people inside Africa at a certain position,
p150
aVwhere all individuals \u2014 100 percent \u2014 have one letter,
p151
aVand everybody outside Africa has another letter.
p152
aVAnd the answer to that, among those millions of differences,
p153
aVis that there is not a single such position.
p154
aVThis may be surprising.
p155
aVMaybe a single individual is misclassified or so.
p156
aVSo we can relax the criterion a bit
p157
aVand say: How many positions do we find
p158
aVwhere 95 percent of people in Africa have
p159
aVone variant,
p160
aV95 percent another variant,
p161
aVand the number of that is 12.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo this is very surprising.
p164
aVIt means that when we look at people
p165
aVand see a person from Africa
p166
aVand a person from Europe or Asia,
p167
aVwe cannot, for a single position in the genome with 100 percent accuracy,
p168
aVpredict what the person would carry.
p169
aVAnd only for 12 positions
p170
aVcan we hope to be 95 percent right.
p171
aVThis may be surprising,
p172
aVbecause we can, of course, look at these people
p173
aVand quite easily say where they or their ancestors came from.
p174
aVSo what this means now
p175
aVis that those traits we then look at
p176
aVand so readily see \u2014
p177
aVfacial features, skin color, hair structure \u2014
p178
aVare not determined by single genes with big effects,
p179
aVbut are determined by many different genetic variants
p180
aVthat seem to vary in frequency
p181
aVbetween different parts of the world.
p182
aa(lp183
VThere is another thing with those traits
p184
aVthat we so easily observe in each other
p185
aVthat I think is worthwhile to consider,
p186
aVand that is that, in a very literal sense,
p187
aVthey're really on the surface of our bodies.
p188
aVThey are what we just said \u2014
p189
aVfacial features, hair structure, skin color.
p190
aVThere are also a number of features
p191
aVthat vary between continents like that
p192
aVthat have to do with how we metabolize food that we ingest,
p193
aVor that have to do
p194
aVwith how our immune systems deal with microbes
p195
aVthat try to invade our bodies.
p196
aVBut so those are all parts of our bodies
p197
aVwhere we very directly interact with our environment,
p198
aVin a direct confrontation, if you like.
p199
aVIt's easy to imagine
p200
aVhow particularly those parts of our bodies
p201
aVwere quickly influenced by selection from the environment
p202
aVand shifted frequencies of genes
p203
aVthat are involved in them.
p204
aVBut if we look on other parts of our bodies
p205
aVwhere we don't directly interact with the environment \u2014
p206
aVour kidneys, our livers, our hearts \u2014
p207
aVthere is no way to say,
p208
aVby just looking at these organs,
p209
aVwhere in the world they would come from.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo there's another interesting thing
p212
aVthat comes from this realization
p213
aVthat humans have a recent common origin in Africa,
p214
aVand that is that when those humans emerged
p215
aVaround 100,000 years ago or so,
p216
aVthey were not alone on the planet.
p217
aVThere were other forms of humans around,
p218
aVmost famously perhaps, Neanderthals \u2014
p219
aVthese robust forms of humans,
p220
aVcompared to the left here
p221
aVwith a modern human skeleton on the right \u2014
p222
aVthat existed in Western Asia and Europe
p223
aVsince several hundreds of thousands of years.
p224
aVSo an interesting question is,
p225
aVwhat happened when we met?
p226
aVWhat happened to the Neanderthals?
p227
aa(lp228
VAnd to begin to answer such questions,
p229
aVmy research group \u2014 since over 25 years now \u2014
p230
aVworks on methods to extract DNA
p231
aVfrom remains of Neanderthals
p232
aVand extinct animals
p233
aVthat are tens of thousands of years old.
p234
aVSo this involves a lot of technical issues
p235
aVin how you extract the DNA,
p236
aVhow you convert it to a form you can sequence.
p237
aVYou have to work very carefully
p238
aVto avoid contamination of experiments
p239
aVwith DNA from yourself.
p240
aVAnd this then, in conjunction with these methods
p241
aVthat allow very many DNA molecules to be sequenced very rapidly,
p242
aVallowed us last year
p243
aVto present the first version of the Neanderthal genome,
p244
aVso that any one of you
p245
aVcan now look on the Internet, on the Neanderthal genome,
p246
aVor at least on the 55 percent of it
p247
aVthat we've been able to reconstruct so far.
p248
aVAnd you can begin to compare it to the genomes
p249
aVof people who live today.
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd one question
p252
aVthat you may then want to ask
p253
aVis, what happened when we met?
p254
aVDid we mix or not?
p255
aVAnd the way to ask that question
p256
aVis to look at the Neanderthal that comes from Southern Europe
p257
aVand compare it to genomes
p258
aVof people who live today.
p259
aVSo we then look
p260
aVto do this with pairs of individuals,
p261
aVstarting with two Africans,
p262
aVlooking at the two African genomes,
p263
aVfinding places where they differ from each other,
p264
aVand in each case ask: What is a Neanderthal like?
p265
aVDoes it match one African or the other African?
p266
aVWe would expect there to be no difference,
p267
aVbecause Neanderthals were never in Africa.
p268
aVThey should be equal, have no reason to be closer
p269
aVto one African than another African.
p270
aVAnd that's indeed the case.
p271
aVStatistically speaking, there is no difference
p272
aVin how often the Neanderthal matches one African or the other.
p273
aVBut this is different
p274
aVif we now look at the European individual and an African.
p275
aVThen, significantly more often,
p276
aVdoes a Neanderthal match the European
p277
aVrather than the African.
p278
aVThe same is true if we look at a Chinese individual
p279
aVversus an African,
p280
aVthe Neanderthal will match the Chinese individual more often.
p281
aVThis may also be surprising
p282
aVbecause the Neanderthals were never in China.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo the model we've proposed to explain this
p285
aVis that when modern humans came out of Africa
p286
aVsometime after 100,000 years ago,
p287
aVthey met Neanderthals.
p288
aVPresumably, they did so first in the Middle East,
p289
aVwhere there were Neanderthals living.
p290
aVIf they then mixed with each other there,
p291
aVthen those modern humans
p292
aVthat became the ancestors
p293
aVof everyone outside Africa
p294
aVcarried with them this Neanderthal component in their genome
p295
aVto the rest of the world.
p296
aVSo that today, the people living outside Africa
p297
aVhave about two and a half percent of their DNA
p298
aVfrom Neanderthals.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo having now a Neanderthal genome
p301
aVon hand as a reference point
p302
aVand having the technologies
p303
aVto look at ancient remains
p304
aVand extract the DNA,
p305
aVwe can begin to apply them elsewhere in the world.
p306
aVAnd the first place we've done that is in Southern Siberia
p307
aVin the Altai Mountains
p308
aVat a place called Denisova,
p309
aVa cave site in this mountain here,
p310
aVwhere archeologists in 2008
p311
aVfound a tiny little piece of bone \u2014
p312
aVthis is a copy of it \u2014
p313
aVthat they realized came from the last phalanx
p314
aVof a little finger of a pinky of a human.
p315
aVAnd it was well enough preserved
p316
aVso we could determine the DNA from this individual,
p317
aVeven to a greater extent
p318
aVthan for the Neanderthals actually,
p319
aVand start relating it to the Neanderthal genome
p320
aVand to people today.
p321
aVAnd we found that this individual
p322
aVshared a common origin for his DNA sequences
p323
aVwith Neanderthals around 640,000 years ago.
p324
aVAnd further back, 800,000 years ago
p325
aVis there a common origin
p326
aVwith present day humans.
p327
aa(lp328
VSo this individual comes from a population
p329
aVthat shares an origin with Neanderthals,
p330
aVbut far back and then have a long independent history.
p331
aVWe call this group of humans,
p332
aVthat we then described for the first time
p333
aVfrom this tiny, tiny little piece of bone,
p334
aVthe Denisovans,
p335
aVafter this place where they were first described.
p336
aVSo we can then ask for Denisovans
p337
aVthe same things as for the Neanderthals:
p338
aVDid they mix with ancestors of present day people?
p339
aVIf we ask that question,
p340
aVand compare the Denisovan genome
p341
aVto people around the world,
p342
aVwe surprisingly find
p343
aVno evidence of Denisovan DNA
p344
aVin any people living even close to Siberia today.
p345
aVBut we do find it in Papua New Guinea
p346
aVand in other islands in Melanesia and the Pacific.
p347
aVSo this presumably means
p348
aVthat these Denisovans had been more widespread in the past,
p349
aVsince we don't think that the ancestors of Melanesians
p350
aVwere ever in Siberia.
p351
aa(lp352
VSo from studying
p353
aVthese genomes of extinct humans,
p354
aVwe're beginning to arrive at a picture of what the world looked like
p355
aVwhen modern humans started coming out of Africa.
p356
aVIn the West, there were Neanderthals;
p357
aVin the East, there were Denisovans \u2014
p358
aVmaybe other forms of humans too
p359
aVthat we've not yet described.
p360
aVWe don't know quite where the borders between these people were,
p361
aVbut we know that in Southern Siberia,
p362
aVthere were both Neanderthals and Denisovans
p363
aVat least at some time in the past.
p364
aVThen modern humans emerged somewhere in Africa,
p365
aVcame out of Africa, presumably in the Middle East.
p366
aVThey meet Neanderthals, mix with them,
p367
aVcontinue to spread over the world,
p368
aVand somewhere in Southeast Asia,
p369
aVthey meet Denisovans and mix with them
p370
aVand continue on out into the Pacific.
p371
aVAnd then these earlier forms of humans disappear,
p372
aVbut they live on a little bit today
p373
aVin some of us \u2014
p374
aVin that people outside of Africa have two and a half percent of their DNA
p375
aVfrom Neanderthals,
p376
aVand people in Melanesia
p377
aVactually have an additional five percent approximately
p378
aVfrom the Denisovans.
p379
aa(lp380
VDoes this then mean that there is after all
p381
aVsome absolute difference
p382
aVbetween people outside Africa and inside Africa
p383
aVin that people outside Africa
p384
aVhave this old component in their genome
p385
aVfrom these extinct forms of humans,
p386
aVwhereas Africans do not?
p387
aVWell I don't think that is the case.
p388
aVPresumably, modern humans
p389
aVemerged somewhere in Africa.
p390
aVThey spread across Africa also, of course,
p391
aVand there were older, earlier forms of humans there.
p392
aVAnd since we mixed elsewhere,
p393
aVI'm pretty sure that one day,
p394
aVwhen we will perhaps have a genome
p395
aVof also these earlier forms in Africa,
p396
aVwe will find that they have also mixed
p397
aVwith early modern humans in Africa.
p398
aa(lp399
VSo to sum up,
p400
aVwhat have we learned from studying genomes
p401
aVof present day humans
p402
aVand extinct humans?
p403
aVWe learn perhaps many things,
p404
aVbut one thing that I find sort of important to mention
p405
aVis that I think the lesson is that we have always mixed.
p406
aVWe mixed with these earlier forms of humans,
p407
aVwherever we met them,
p408
aVand we mixed with each other ever since.
