VI told you three things last year.
p4
aVI told you that the statistics of the world
p5
aVhave not been made properly available.
p6
aVBecause of that, we still have the old mindset
p7
aVof developing in industrialized countries, which is wrong.
p8
aVAnd that animated graphics can make a difference.
p9
aVThings are changing
p10
aVand today, on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page,
p11
aVit says, by first of May, full access to the databases.
p12
aV(Applause)
p13
aVAnd if I could share the image with you on the screen.
p14
aVSo three things have happened.
p15
aVU.N. opened their statistic databases,
p16
aVand we have a new version of the software
p17
aVup working as a beta on the net,
p18
aVso you don't have to download it any longer.
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd let me repeat what you saw last year.
p21
aVThe bubbles are the countries.
p22
aVHere you have the fertility rate \u2014 the number of children per woman \u2014
p23
aVand there you have the length of life in years.
p24
aVThis is 1950 \u2014 those were the industrialized countries,
p25
aVthose were developing countries.
p26
aVAt that time there was a "we" and "them."
p27
aVThere was a huge difference in the world.
p28
aVBut then it changed, and it went on quite well.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd this is what happens.
p31
aVYou can see how China is the red, big bubble.
p32
aVThe blue there is India.
p33
aVAnd they go over all this \u2014 I'm going to try to be
p34
aVa little more serious this year in showing you
p35
aVhow things really changed.
p36
aVAnd it's Africa that stands out as the problem down here, doesn't it?
p37
aVLarge families still, and the HIV epidemic
p38
aVbrought down the countries like this.
p39
aVThis is more or less what we saw last year,
p40
aVand this is how it will go on into the future.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd I will talk on, is this possible?
p43
aVBecause you see now, I presented statistics that don't exist.
p44
aVBecause this is where we are.
p45
aVWill it be possible that this will happen?
p46
aVI cover my lifetime here, you know?
p47
aVI expect to live 100 years.
p48
aVAnd this is where we are today.
p49
aVNow could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world?
p50
aVAnd I would like to show that against child survival.
p51
aVWe'll swap the axis.
p52
aVHere you have child mortality \u2014 that is, survival \u2014
p53
aVfour kids dying there, 200 dying there.
p54
aVAnd this is GDP per capita on this axis.
p55
aVAnd this was 2007.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd if I go back in time, I've added some historical statistics \u2014
p58
aVhere we go, here we go, here we go \u2014 not so much statistics 100 years ago.
p59
aVSome countries still had statistics.
p60
aVWe are looking down in the archive,
p61
aVand when we are down into 1820,
p62
aVthere is only Austria and Sweden that can produce numbers.
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aVBut they were down here. They had 1,000 dollars per person per year.
p65
aVAnd they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo this is what happens in the world, if we play the entire world.
p68
aVHow they got slowly richer and richer,
p69
aVand they add statistics.
p70
aVIsn't it beautiful when they get statistics?
p71
aVYou see the importance of that?
p72
aVAnd here, children don't live longer.
p73
aVThe last century, 1870, was bad for the kids in Europe,
p74
aVbecause most of this statistics is Europe.
p75
aVIt was only by the turn of the century
p76
aVthat more than 90 percent of the children survived their first year.
p77
aVThis is India coming up, with the first data from India.
p78
aVAnd this is the United States moving away here, earning more money.
p79
aVAnd we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here.
p80
aVAnd it moves up with Mao Tse-Tung getting health,
p81
aVnot getting so rich.
p82
aVThere he died, then Deng Xiaoping brings money.
p83
aVIt moves this way over here.
p84
aVAnd the bubbles keep moving up there,
p85
aVand this is what the world looks like today.
p86
aV(Applause)
p87
aa(lp88
VLet us have a look at the United States.
p89
aVWe have a function here \u2014 I can tell the world, "Stay where you are."
p90
aVAnd I take the United States \u2014 we still want to see the background \u2014
p91
aVI put them up like this, and now we go backwards.
p92
aVAnd we can see that the United States
p93
aVgoes to the right of the mainstream.
p94
aVThey are on the money side all the time.
p95
aVAnd down in 1915, the United States was a neighbor of India \u2014
p96
aVpresent, contemporary India.
p97
aVAnd that means United States was richer,
p98
aVbut lost more kids than India is doing today, proportionally.
p99
aVAnd look here \u2014 compare to the Philippines of today.
p100
aVThe Philippines of today has almost the same economy
p101
aVas the United States during the First World War.
p102
aVBut we have to bring United States forward quite a while
p103
aVto find the same health of the United States
p104
aVas we have in the Philippines.
p105
aVAbout 1957 here, the health of the United States
p106
aVis the same as the Philippines.
p107
aVAnd this is the drama of this world which many call globalized,
p108
aVis that Asia, Arabic countries, Latin America,
p109
aVare much more ahead in being healthy, educated,
p110
aVhaving human resources than they are economically.
p111
aa(lp112
VThere's a discrepancy in what's happening today
p113
aVin the emerging economies.
p114
aVThere now, social benefits, social progress,
p115
aVare going ahead of economical progress.
p116
aVAnd 1957 \u2014 the United States had the same economy as Chile has today.
p117
aVAnd how long do we have to bring United States
p118
aVto get the same health as Chile has today?
p119
aVI think we have to go, there \u2014 we have 2001, or 2002 \u2014
p120
aVthe United States has the same health as Chile.
p121
aVChile's catching up!
p122
aVWithin some years Chile may have better child survival
p123
aVthan the United States.
p124
aVThis is really a change, that you have this lag
p125
aVof more or less 30, 40 years' difference on the health.
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd behind the health is the educational level.
p128
aVAnd there's a lot of infrastructure things,
p129
aVand general human resources are there.
p130
aVNow we can take away this \u2014
p131
aVand I would like to show you the rate of speed,
p132
aVthe rate of change, how fast they have gone.
p133
aVAnd we go back to 1920, and I want to look at Japan.
p134
aVAnd I want to look at Sweden and the United States.
p135
aVAnd I'm going to stage a race here
p136
aVbetween this sort of yellowish Ford here
p137
aVand the red Toyota down there,
p138
aVand the brownish Volvo.
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aVAnd here we go. Here we go.
p141
aVThe Toyota has a very bad start down here, you can see,
p142
aVand the United States Ford is going off-road there.
p143
aVAnd the Volvo is doing quite fine.
p144
aVThis is the war. The Toyota got off track, and now
p145
aVthe Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden \u2014
p146
aVcan you see that?
p147
aVAnd they are taking over Sweden,
p148
aVand they are now healthier than Sweden.
p149
aVThat's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota.
p150
aV(Laughter)
p151
aVAnd now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan.
p152
aVThey really caught up.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd this changes gradually.
p155
aVWe have to look over generations to understand it.
p156
aVAnd let me show you my own sort of family history \u2014
p157
aVwe made these graphs here.
p158
aVAnd this is the same thing, money down there, and health, you know?
p159
aVAnd this is my family.
p160
aVThis is Sweden, 1830, when my great-great-grandma was born.
p161
aVSweden was like Sierra Leone today.
p162
aVAnd this is when great-grandma was born, 1863.
p163
aVAnd Sweden was like Mozambique.
p164
aVAnd this is when my grandma was born, 1891.
p165
aVShe took care of me as a child,
p166
aVso I'm not talking about statistic now \u2014
p167
aVnow it's oral history in my family.
p168
aVThat's when I believe statistics,
p169
aVwhen it's grandma-verified statistics.
p170
aV(Laughter)
p171
aVI think it's the best way of verifying historical statistics.
p172
aVSweden was like Ghana.
p173
aVIt's interesting to see the enormous diversity
p174
aVwithin sub-Saharan Africa.
p175
aVI told you last year, I'll tell you again,
p176
aVmy mother was born in Egypt, and I \u2014 who am I?
p177
aVI'm the Mexican in the family.
p178
aVAnd my daughter, she was born in Chile,
p179
aVand the grand-daughter was born in Singapore,
p180
aVnow the healthiest country on this Earth.
p181
aVIt bypassed Sweden about two to three years ago,
p182
aVwith better child survival.
p183
aVBut they're very small, you know?
p184
aVThey're so close to the hospital we can never
p185
aVbeat them out in these forests.
p186
aV(Laughter)
p187
aVBut homage to Singapore.
p188
aa(lp189
VSingapore is the best one.
p190
aVNow this looks also like a very good story.
p191
aVBut it's not really that easy, that it's all a good story.
p192
aVBecause I have to show you one of the other facilities.
p193
aVWe can also make the color here represent the variable \u2014
p194
aVand what am I choosing here?
p195
aVCarbon-dioxide emission, metric ton per capita.
p196
aVThis is 1962, and United States was emitting 16 tons per person.
p197
aVAnd China was emitting 0.6,
p198
aVand India was emitting 0.32 tons per capita.
p199
aVAnd what happens when we moved on?
p200
aVWell, you see the nice story of getting richer
p201
aVand getting healthier \u2014
p202
aVeveryone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide.
p203
aVThere is no one who has done it so far.
p204
aVAnd we don't have all the updated data
p205
aVany longer, because this is really hot data today.
p206
aVAnd there we are, 2001.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd in the discussion I attended with global leaders, you know,
p209
aVmany say now the problem is that the emerging economies,
p210
aVthey are getting out too much carbon dioxide.
p211
aVThe Minister of the Environment of India said,
p212
aV"Well, you were the one who caused the problem."
p213
aVThe OECD countries \u2014 the high-income countries \u2014
p214
aVthey were the ones who caused the climate change.
p215
aV"But we forgive you, because you didn't know it.
p216
aVBut from now on, we count per capita.
p217
aVFrom now on we count per capita.
p218
aVAnd everyone is responsible for the per capita emission."
p219
aa(lp220
VThis really shows you, we have not seen good economic
p221
aVand health progress anywhere in the world
p222
aVwithout destroying the climate.
p223
aVAnd this is really what has to be changed.
p224
aVI've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world,
p225
aVbut I don't think it's like this.
p226
aVThe world is quite a messy place.
p227
aVThis we can call Dollar Street.
p228
aVEveryone lives on this street here.
p229
aVWhat they earn here \u2014 what number they live on \u2014
p230
aVis how much they earn per day.
p231
aVThis family earns about one dollar per day.
p232
aVWe drive up the street here,
p233
aVwe find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day.
p234
aVAnd we drive away here \u2014 we find the first garden in the street,
p235
aVand they earn 10 to 50 dollars a day.
p236
aa(lp237
VAnd how do they live?
p238
aVIf we look at the bed here, we can see
p239
aVthat they sleep on a rug on the floor.
p240
aVThis is what poverty line is \u2014
p241
aV80 percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs,
p242
aVthe food for the day.
p243
aVThis is two to five dollars. You have a bed.
p244
aVAnd here it's a much nicer bedroom, you can see.
p245
aVI lectured on this for Ikea, and they wanted to see
p246
aVthe sofa immediately here.
p247
aV(Laughter)
p248
aVAnd this is the sofa, how it will emerge from there.
p249
aVAnd the interesting thing, when you go around here in the photo panorama,
p250
aVyou see the family still sitting on the floor there.
p251
aVAlthough there is a sofa,
p252
aVif you watch in the kitchen, you can see that
p253
aVthe great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars.
p254
aVIt comes beyond here, when you really can get
p255
aVgood working conditions in the family.
p256
aVAnd if you really want to see the difference,
p257
aVyou look at the toilet over here.
p258
aVThis can change. This can change.
p259
aVThese are all pictures and images from Africa,
p260
aVand it can become much better.
p261
aVWe can get out of poverty.
p262
aa(lp263
VMy own research has not been in IT or anything like this.
p264
aVI spent 20 years in interviews with African farmers
p265
aVwho were on the verge of famine.
p266
aVAnd this is the result of the farmers-needs research.
p267
aVThe nice thing here is that you can't see
p268
aVwho are the researchers in this picture.
p269
aVThat's when research functions in poor societies \u2014
p270
aVyou must really live with the people.
p271
aa(lp272
VWhen you're in poverty, everything is about survival.
p273
aVIt's about having food.
p274
aVAnd these two young farmers, they are girls now \u2014
p275
aVbecause the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS \u2014
p276
aVthey discuss with a trained agronomist.
p277
aVThis is one of the best agronomists in Malawi, Junatambe Kumbira,
p278
aVand he's discussing what sort of cassava they will plant \u2014
p279
aVthe best converter of sunshine to food that man has found.
p280
aVAnd they are very, very eagerly interested to get advice,
p281
aVand that's to survive in poverty.
p282
aVThat's one context.
p283
aVGetting out of poverty.
p284
aVThe women told us one thing. "Get us technology.
p285
aVWe hate this mortar, to stand hours and hours.
p286
aVGet us a mill so that we can mill our flour,
p287
aVthen we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves."
p288
aVTechnology will bring you out of poverty,
p289
aVbut there's a need for a market to get away from poverty.
p290
aVAnd this woman is very happy now, bringing her products to the market.
p291
aVBut she's very thankful for the public investment in schooling
p292
aVso she can count, and won't be cheated when she reaches the market.
p293
aVShe wants her kid to be healthy, so she can go to the market
p294
aVand doesn't have to stay home.
p295
aVAnd she wants the infrastructure \u2014 it is nice with a paved road.
p296
aVIt's also good with credit.
p297
aVMicro-credits gave her the bicycle, you know.
p298
aVAnd information will tell her when to go to market with which product.
p299
aVYou can do this.
p300
aa(lp301
VI find my experience from 20 years of Africa is that
p302
aVthe seemingly impossible is possible.
p303
aVAfrica has not done bad.
p304
aVIn 50 years they've gone from a pre-Medieval situation
p305
aVto a very decent 100-year-ago Europe,
p306
aVwith a functioning nation and state.
p307
aVI would say that sub-Saharan Africa has done best in the world
p308
aVduring the last 50 years.
p309
aVBecause we don't consider where they came from.
p310
aVIt's this stupid concept of developing countries
p311
aVthat puts us, Argentina and Mozambique together 50 years ago,
p312
aVand says that Mozambique did worse.
p313
aVWe have to know a little more about the world.
p314
aVI have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine.
p315
aVHe knows everything.
p316
aVHe knows the name of the grape, the temperature and everything.
p317
aVI only know two types of wine \u2014 red and white.
p318
aV(Laughter)
p319
aVBut my neighbor only knows two types of countries \u2014
p320
aVindustrialized and developing.
p321
aVAnd I know 200, I know about the small data.
p322
aVBut you can do that.
p323
aV(Applause)
p324
aa(lp325
VBut I have to get serious. And how do you get serious?
p326
aVYou make a PowerPoint, you know?
p327
aV(Laughter)
p328
aVHomage to the Office package, no?
p329
aVWhat is this, what is this, what am I telling?
p330
aVI'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development.
p331
aVEveryone wants your pet thing.
p332
aVIf you are in the corporate sector, you love micro-credit.
p333
aVIf you are fighting in a non-governmental organization,
p334
aVyou love equity between gender.
p335
aVOr if you are a teacher, you'll love UNESCO, and so on.
p336
aVOn the global level, we have to have more than our own thing.
p337
aVWe need everything.
p338
aVAll these things are important for development,
p339
aVespecially when you just get out of poverty
p340
aVand you should go towards welfare.
p341
aa(lp342
VNow, what we need to think about
p343
aVis, what is a goal for development,
p344
aVand what are the means for development?
p345
aVLet me first grade what are the most important means.
p346
aVEconomic growth to me, as a public-health professor,
p347
aVis the most important thing for development
p348
aVbecause it explains 80 percent of survival.
p349
aVGovernance. To have a government which functions \u2014
p350
aVthat's what brought California out of the misery of 1850.
p351
aVIt was the government that made law function finally.
p352
aVEducation, human resources are important.
p353
aVHealth is also important, but not that much as a mean.
p354
aVEnvironment is important.
p355
aVHuman rights is also important, but it just gets one cross.
p356
aa(lp357
VNow what about goals? Where are we going toward?
p358
aVWe are not interested in money.
p359
aVMoney is not a goal.
p360
aVIt's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goal.
p361
aVGovernance, well it's fun to vote in a little thing,
p362
aVbut it's not a goal.
p363
aVAnd going to school, that's not a goal, it's a mean.
p364
aVHealth I give two points. I mean it's nice to be healthy
p365
aV\u2014 at my age especially \u2014 you can stand here, you're healthy.
p366
aVAnd that's good, it gets two plusses.
p367
aVEnvironment is very, very crucial.
p368
aVThere's nothing for the grandkid if you don't save up.
p369
aVBut where are the important goals?
p370
aVOf course, it's human rights.
p371
aVHuman rights is the goal,
p372
aVbut it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development.
p373
aVAnd culture. Culture is the most important thing, I would say,
p374
aVbecause that's what brings joy to life.
p375
aVThat's the value of living.
p376
aa(lp377
VSo the seemingly impossible is possible.
p378
aVEven African countries can achieve this.
p379
aVAnd I've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible.
p380
aVAnd remember, please remember my main message,
p381
aVwhich is this: the seemingly impossible is possible.
p382
aVWe can have a good world.
p383
aVI showed you the shots, I proved it in the PowerPoint,
p384
aVand I think I will convince you also by culture.
p385
aV(Laughter)
p386
aV(Applause)
p387
aVBring me my sword!
p388
aVSword swallowing is from ancient India.
p389
aVIt's a cultural expression that for thousands of years
p390
aVhas inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious.
p391
aV(Laughter)
p392
aVAnd I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible
p393
aVby taking this piece of steel \u2014 solid steel \u2014
p394
aVthis is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army, 1850,
p395
aVin the last year we had war.
p396
aVAnd it's all solid steel \u2014 you can hear here.
p397
aVAnd I'm going to take this blade of steel,
p398
aVand push it down through my body of blood and flesh,
p399
aVand prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible.
p400
aVCan I request a moment of absolute silence?
