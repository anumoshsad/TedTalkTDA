VI am a Hazara,
p4
aVand the homeland of my people is Afghanistan.
p5
aVLike hundreds of thousands of other Hazara kids,
p6
aVI was born in exile.
p7
aVThe ongoing persecution and operation against the Hazaras
p8
aVforced my parents to leave Afghanistan.
p9
aa(lp10
VThis persecution has had a long history going back to the late 1800s,
p11
aVand the rule of King Abdur Rahman.
p12
aVHe killed 63 percent of  the Hazara population.
p13
aVHe built minarets with their heads.
p14
aVMany Hazaras were sold into slavery,
p15
aVand many others fled the country for neighboring Iran and Pakistan.
p16
aVMy parents also fled to Pakistan,
p17
aVand settled in Quetta, where I was born.
p18
aa(lp19
VAfter the September 11 attack on the Twin Towers,
p20
aVI got a chance to go to Afghanistan
p21
aVfor the first time, with foreign journalists.
p22
aVI was only 18, and I got a job working as an interpreter.
p23
aVAfter four years,
p24
aVI felt it was safe enough to move to Afghanistan permanently,
p25
aVand I was working there as a documentary photographer,
p26
aVand I worked on many stories.
p27
aa(lp28
VOne of the most important stories that I did
p29
aVwas the dancing boys of Afghanistan.
p30
aVIt is a tragic story about an appalling tradition.
p31
aVIt involves young kids dancing for warlords
p32
aVand powerful men in the society.
p33
aVThese boys are often abducted or bought from their poor parents,
p34
aVand they are put to work as sex slaves.
p35
aVThis is Shukur.
p36
aVHe was kidnapped from Kabul by a warlord.
p37
aVHe was taken to another province,
p38
aVwhere he was forced to work as a sex slave for the warlord and his friends.
p39
aa(lp40
VWhen this story was published in the Washington Post,
p41
aVI started receiving death threats,
p42
aVand I was forced to leave Afghanistan,
p43
aVas my parents were.
p44
aVAlong with my family, I returned back to Quetta.
p45
aVThe situation in Quetta had changed dramatically since I left in 2005.
p46
aVOnce a peaceful haven for the Hazaras,
p47
aVit had now turned into the most dangerous city in Pakistan.
p48
aVHazaras are confined into two small areas,
p49
aVand they are marginalized socially, educationally, and financially.
p50
aVThis is Nadir.
p51
aVI had known him since my childhood.
p52
aVHe was injured when his van was ambushed by terrorists in Quetta.
p53
aVHe later died of his injuries.
p54
aVAround 1,600 Hazara members
p55
aVhad been killed in various attacks,
p56
aVand around 3,000 of them were injured,
p57
aVand many of them permanently disabled.
p58
aVThe attacks on the Hazara community would only get worse,
p59
aVso it was not surprising that many wanted to flee.
p60
aa(lp61
VAfter Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan,
p62
aVAustralia is home to the fourth largest population of Hazaras in the world.
p63
aVWhen it came time to leave Pakistan,
p64
aVAustralia seemed the obvious choice.
p65
aVFinancially, only one of us could leave,
p66
aVand it was decided that I would go,
p67
aVin the hope that if I arrived at my destination safely,
p68
aVI could work to get the rest of my family to join me later.
p69
aa(lp70
VWe all knew about the risks,
p71
aVand how terrifying the journey is,
p72
aVand I met many people who lost loved ones at sea.
p73
aVIt was a desperate decision to take, to leave everything behind,
p74
aVand no one makes this decision easily.
p75
aVIf I had been able to simply fly to Australia,
p76
aVit would have taken me less than 24 hours.
p77
aVBut getting a visa was impossible.
p78
aVMy journey was much longer,
p79
aVmuch more complicated,
p80
aVand certainly more dangerous,
p81
aVtraveling to Thailand by air,
p82
aVand then by road and boat to Malaysia and into Indonesia,
p83
aVpaying people and smugglers all the way
p84
aVand spending a lot of time hiding
p85
aVand a lot of time in fear of being caught.
p86
aa(lp87
VIn Indonesia, I joined a group of seven asylum seekers.
p88
aVWe all shared a bedroom
p89
aVin a town outside of Jakarta called Bogor.
p90
aVAfter spending a week in Bogor,
p91
aVthree of my roommates left for the perilous journey,
p92
aVand we got the news two days later
p93
aVthat a distressed boat sank in the sea en route to Christmas Island.
p94
aVWe found out that our three roommates \u2014 Nawroz, Jaffar and Shabbir \u2014
p95
aVwere also among those.
p96
aVOnly Jaffar was rescued.
p97
aVShabbir and Nawroz were never seen again.
p98
aVIt made me think,
p99
aVam I doing the right thing?
p100
aVI concluded I really had no other choice but to go on.
p101
aa(lp102
VA few weeks later, we got the call from the people smuggler
p103
aVto alert us that the boat is ready for us to commence our sea journey.
p104
aVTaken in the night towards the main vessel
p105
aVon a motorboat,
p106
aVwe boarded an old fishing boat that was already overloaded.
p107
aVThere were 93 of us,
p108
aVand we were all below deck.
p109
aVNo one was allowed up on the top.
p110
aVWe all paid 6,000 dollars each
p111
aVfor this part of the trip.
p112
aVThe first night and day went smoothly,
p113
aVbut by the second night,  the weather turned.
p114
aa(lp115
VWaves tossed the boat around, and the timbers groaned.
p116
aVPeople below deck were crying, praying, recalling their loved ones.
p117
aVThey were screaming.
p118
aVIt was a terrible moment.
p119
aVIt was like a scene from doomsday,
p120
aVor maybe like one of those scenes from those Hollywood movies
p121
aVthat shows that everything is breaking apart
p122
aVand the world is just ending.
p123
aVIt was happening to us for real.
p124
aVWe didn't have any hope.
p125
aVOur boat was floating like a matchbox on the water
p126
aVwithout any control.
p127
aVThe waves were much higher than our boat,
p128
aVand the water poured in faster than the motor pumps could take it out.
p129
aVWe all lost hope.
p130
aVWe thought, this is the end.
p131
aVWe were watching our deaths,
p132
aVand I was documenting it.
p133
aa(lp134
VThe captain told us
p135
aVthat we are not going to make it,
p136
aVwe have to turn back the boat.
p137
aVWe went on the deck
p138
aVand turned our torches on and off
p139
aVto attract the attention of any passing boat.
p140
aVWe kept trying to attract their attention by waving our life jackets and whistling.
p141
aa(lp142
VEventually, we made it to a small island.
p143
aVOur boat crashing onto the rocks,
p144
aVI slipped into the water
p145
aVand destroyed my camera, whatever I had documented.
p146
aVBut luckily, the memory card survived.
p147
aa(lp148
VIt was a thick forest.
p149
aVWe all split up into many groups as we argued over what to do next.
p150
aVWe were all scared and confused.
p151
aVThen, after spending the night on the beach,
p152
aVwe found a jetty and coconuts.
p153
aVWe hailed a boat from a nearby resort,
p154
aVand then were quickly handed over to Indonesian water police.
p155
aa(lp156
VAt Serang Detention Center,
p157
aVan immigration officer came and furtively strip-searched us.
p158
aVHe took our mobile, my $300 cash,
p159
aVour shoes that we should not be able to escape,
p160
aVbut we kept watching the guards, checking their movements,
p161
aVand around 4 a.m. when they sat around a fire,
p162
aVwe removed two glass layers from an outside facing window
p163
aVand slipped through.
p164
aVWe climbed a tree next to an outer wall that was topped with the shards of glass.
p165
aVWe put the pillow on that
p166
aVand wrapped our forearms with bedsheets
p167
aVand climbed the wall,
p168
aVand we ran away with bare feet.
p169
aa(lp170
VI was free,
p171
aVwith an uncertain future,
p172
aVno money.
p173
aVThe only thing I had was the memory card with the pictures and footage.
p174
aVWhen my documentary was aired on SBS Dateline,
p175
aVmany of my friends came to know about my situation,
p176
aVand they tried to help me.
p177
aVThey did not allow me to take any other boat to risk my life.
p178
aVI also decided to stay in Indonesia and process my case through UNHCR,
p179
aVbut I was really afraid that I would end up in Indonesia
p180
aVfor many years doing nothing and unable to work,
p181
aVlike every other asylum seeker.
p182
aa(lp183
VBut it had happened to be a little bit different with me.
p184
aVI was lucky.
p185
aVMy contacts worked to expedite my case through UNHCR,
p186
aVand I got resettled in Australia in May 2013.
p187
aa(lp188
VNot every asylum seeker is lucky like me.
p189
aVIt is really difficult to live a life with an uncertain fate, in limbo.
p190
aa(lp191
VThe issue of asylum seekers in Australia
p192
aVhas been so extremely politicized
p193
aVthat it has lost its human face.
p194
aVThe asylum seekers have been demonized and then presented to the people.
p195
aVI hope my story and the story of other Hazaras
p196
aVcould shed some light to show the people
p197
aVhow these people are suffering in their countries of origin,
p198
aVand how they suffer,
p199
aVwhy they risk their lives to seek asylum.
p200
aa(lp201
VThank you.
