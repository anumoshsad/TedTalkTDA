VSo it's 2006.
p4
aVMy friend Harold Ford calls me.
p5
aVHe's running for U.S. Senate in Tennessee,
p6
aVand he says, "Mellody, I desperately need some national press. Do you have any ideas?"
p7
aVSo I had an idea. I called a friend
p8
aVwho was in New York
p9
aVat one of the most successful media companies in the world,
p10
aVand she said, "Why don't we host
p11
aVan editorial board lunch for Harold?
p12
aVYou come with him."
p13
aa(lp14
VHarold and I arrive in New York.
p15
aVWe are in our best suits.
p16
aVWe look like shiny new pennies.
p17
aVAnd we get to the receptionist, and we say,
p18
aV"We're here for the lunch."
p19
aVShe motions for us to follow her.
p20
aVWe walk through a series of corridors,
p21
aVand all of a sudden we find ourselves
p22
aVin a stark room,
p23
aVat which point she looks at us and she says,
p24
aV"Where are your uniforms?"
p25
aa(lp26
VJust as this happens,
p27
aVmy friend rushes in.
p28
aVThe blood drains from her face.
p29
aVThere are literally no words, right?
p30
aVAnd I look at her, and I say,
p31
aV"Now, don't you think we need
p32
aVmore than one black person in the U.S. Senate?"
p33
aa(lp34
VNow Harold and I \u2014
p35
aV(Applause) \u2014
p36
aVwe still laugh about that story,
p37
aVand in many ways, the moment caught me off guard,
p38
aVbut deep, deep down inside,
p39
aVI actually wasn't surprised.
p40
aVAnd I wasn't surprised because of something
p41
aVmy mother taught me about 30 years before.
p42
aVYou see, my mother was ruthlessly realistic.
p43
aVI remember one day coming home from a birthday party
p44
aVwhere I was the only black kid invited,
p45
aVand instead of asking me the normal motherly questions
p46
aVlike, "Did you have fun?" or "How was the cake?"
p47
aVmy mother looked at me and she said,
p48
aV"How did they treat you?"
p49
aVI was seven. I did not understand.
p50
aVI mean, why would anyone treat me differently?
p51
aVBut she knew.
p52
aVAnd she looked me right in the eye and she said,
p53
aV"They will not always treat you well."
p54
aa(lp55
VNow, race is one of those topics in America
p56
aVthat makes people extraordinarily uncomfortable.
p57
aVYou bring it up at a dinner party
p58
aVor in a workplace environment,
p59
aVit is literally the conversational equivalent
p60
aVof touching the third rail.
p61
aVThere is shock,
p62
aVfollowed by a long silence.
p63
aVAnd even coming here today,
p64
aVI told some friends and colleagues
p65
aVthat I planned to talk about race,
p66
aVand they warned me, they told me, don't do it,
p67
aVthat there'd be huge risks
p68
aVin me talking about this topic,
p69
aVthat people might think I'm a militant black woman
p70
aVand I would ruin my career.
p71
aVAnd I have to tell you,
p72
aVI actually for a moment was a bit afraid.
p73
aVThen I realized,
p74
aVthe first step to solving any problem
p75
aVis to not hide from it,
p76
aVand the first step to any form of action
p77
aVis awareness.
p78
aVAnd so I decided to actually talk about race.
p79
aVAnd I decided that if I came here and shared with you
p80
aVsome of my experiences,
p81
aVthat maybe we could all be a little less anxious
p82
aVand a little more bold
p83
aVin our conversations about race.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow I know there are people out there who will say
p86
aVthat the election of Barack Obama meant
p87
aVthat it was the end of racial discrimination
p88
aVfor all eternity, right?
p89
aVBut I work in the investment business,
p90
aVand we have a saying:
p91
aVThe numbers do not lie.
p92
aVAnd here, there are significant,
p93
aVquantifiable racial disparities
p94
aVthat cannot be ignored,
p95
aVin household wealth, household income,
p96
aVjob opportunities, healthcare.
p97
aVOne example from corporate America:
p98
aVEven though white men
p99
aVmake up just 30 percent of the U.S. population,
p100
aVthey hold 70 percent of all corporate board seats.
p101
aVOf the Fortune 250,
p102
aVthere are only seven CEOs that are minorities,
p103
aVand of the thousands of publicly traded companies today, thousands,
p104
aVonly two are chaired by black women,
p105
aVand you're looking at one of them,
p106
aVthe same one who, not too long ago,
p107
aVwas nearly mistaken for kitchen help.
p108
aVSo that is a fact.
p109
aVNow I have this thought experiment
p110
aVthat I play with myself, when I say,
p111
aVimagine if I walked you into a room
p112
aVand it was of a major corporation, like ExxonMobil,
p113
aVand every single person around the boardroom were black,
p114
aVyou would think that were weird.
p115
aVBut if I walked you into a Fortune 500 company,
p116
aVand everyone around the table is a white male,
p117
aVwhen will it be that we think that's weird too?
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd I know how we got here.
p120
aV(Applause)
p121
aa(lp122
VI know how we got here.
p123
aVYou know, there was institutionalized,
p124
aVat one time legalized, discrimination in our country.
p125
aVThere's no question about it.
p126
aVBut still, as I grapple with this issue,
p127
aVmy mother's question hangs in the air for me:
p128
aVHow did they treat you?
p129
aa(lp130
VNow, I do not raise this issue to complain
p131
aVor in any way to elicit any kind of sympathy.
p132
aVI have succeeded in my life
p133
aVbeyond my wildest expectations,
p134
aVand I have been treated well by people of all races
p135
aVmore often than I have not.
p136
aVI tell the uniform story because it happened.
p137
aVI cite those statistics around corporate board diversity
p138
aVbecause they are real,
p139
aVand I stand here today
p140
aVtalking about this issue of racial discrimination
p141
aVbecause I believe it threatens to rob
p142
aVanother generation of all the opportunities
p143
aVthat all of us want for all of our children,
p144
aVno matter what their color
p145
aVor where they come from.
p146
aVAnd I think it also threatens to hold back businesses.
p147
aVYou see, researchers have coined this term
p148
aV"color blindness"
p149
aVto describe a learned behavior where we pretend
p150
aVthat we don't notice race.
p151
aVIf you happen to be surrounded by a bunch of people
p152
aVwho look like you, that's purely accidental.
p153
aVNow, color blindness, in my view,
p154
aVdoesn't mean that there's no racial discrimination,
p155
aVand there's fairness.
p156
aVIt doesn't mean that at all. It doesn't ensure it.
p157
aVIn my view, color blindness is very dangerous
p158
aVbecause it means we're ignoring the problem.
p159
aVThere was a corporate study that said that,
p160
aVinstead of avoiding race,
p161
aVthe really smart corporations actually deal with it head on.
p162
aVThey actually recognize that embracing diversity
p163
aVmeans recognizing all races,
p164
aVincluding the majority one.
p165
aVBut I'll be the first one to tell you,
p166
aVthis subject matter can be hard,
p167
aVawkward, uncomfortable \u2014 but that's kind of the point.
p168
aa(lp169
VIn the spirit of debunking racial stereotypes,
p170
aVthe one that black people don't like to swim,
p171
aVI'm going to tell you how much I love to swim.
p172
aVI love to swim so much
p173
aVthat as an adult, I swim with a coach.
p174
aVAnd one day my coach had me do a drill
p175
aVwhere I had to swim to one end of a 25-meter pool
p176
aVwithout taking a breath.
p177
aVAnd every single time I failed,
p178
aVI had to start over.
p179
aVAnd I failed a lot.
p180
aVBy the end, I got it, but when I got out of the pool,
p181
aVI was exasperated and tired and annoyed,
p182
aVand I said, "Why are we doing breath-holding exercises?"
p183
aVAnd my coach looked me at me, and he said, "Mellody,
p184
aVthat was not a breath-holding exercise.
p185
aVThat drill was to make you comfortable
p186
aVbeing uncomfortable,
p187
aVbecause that's how most of us spend our days."
p188
aVIf we can learn to deal with our discomfort,
p189
aVand just relax into it,
p190
aVwe'll have a better life.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo I think it's time for us to be comfortable
p193
aVwith the uncomfortable conversation about race:
p194
aVblack, white, Asian, Hispanic,
p195
aVmale, female, all of us,
p196
aVif we truly believe in equal rights
p197
aVand equal opportunity in America,
p198
aVI think we have to have real conversations
p199
aVabout this issue.
p200
aVWe cannot afford to be color blind.
p201
aVWe have to be color brave.
p202
aVWe have to be willing, as teachers and parents
p203
aVand entrepreneurs and scientists,
p204
aVwe have to be willing to have
p205
aVproactive conversations about race
p206
aVwith honesty and understanding and courage,
p207
aVnot because it's the right thing to do,
p208
aVbut because it's the smart thing to do,
p209
aVbecause our businesses and our products
p210
aVand our science, our research,
p211
aVall of that will be better with greater diversity.
p212
aa(lp213
VNow, my favorite example of color bravery
p214
aVis a guy named John Skipper.
p215
aVHe runs ESPN.
p216
aVHe's a North Carolina native,
p217
aVquintessential Southern gentleman, white.
p218
aVHe joined ESPN, which already had a culture
p219
aVof inclusion and diversity, but he took it up a notch.
p220
aVHe demanded that every open position
p221
aVhave a diverse slate of candidates.
p222
aVNow he says the senior people
p223
aVin the beginning bristled,
p224
aVand they would come to him and say,
p225
aV"Do you want me to hire the minority,
p226
aVor do you want me to hire the best person for the job?"
p227
aVAnd Skipper says his answers were always the same:
p228
aV"Yes."
p229
aVAnd by saying yes to diversity,
p230
aVI honestly believe that ESPN
p231
aVis the most valuable cable franchise in the world.
p232
aVI think that's a part of the secret sauce.
p233
aa(lp234
VNow I can tell you, in my own industry,
p235
aVat Ariel Investments, we actually view our diversity
p236
aVas a competitive advantage,
p237
aVand that advantage can extend way beyond business.
p238
aVThere's a guy named Scott Page at the University of Michigan.
p239
aVHe is the first person to develop
p240
aVa mathematical calculation for diversity.
p241
aVHe says, if you're trying to solve a really hard problem,
p242
aVreally hard,
p243
aVthat you should have a diverse group of people,
p244
aVincluding those with diverse intellects.
p245
aVThe example that he gives is the smallpox epidemic.
p246
aVWhen it was ravaging Europe,
p247
aVthey brought together all these scientists,
p248
aVand they were stumped.
p249
aVAnd the beginnings of the cure to the disease
p250
aVcame from the most unlikely source,
p251
aVa dairy farmer who noticed that the milkmaids
p252
aVwere not getting smallpox.
p253
aVAnd the smallpox vaccination is bovine-based
p254
aVbecause of that dairy farmer.
p255
aa(lp256
VNow I'm sure you're sitting here and you're saying,
p257
aVI don't run a cable company,
p258
aVI don't run an investment firm,
p259
aVI am not a dairy farmer.
p260
aVWhat can I do?
p261
aVAnd I'm telling you, you can be color brave.
p262
aVIf you're part of a hiring process
p263
aVor an admissions process,
p264
aVyou can be color brave.
p265
aVIf you are trying to solve a really hard problem,
p266
aVyou can speak up and be color brave.
p267
aVNow I know people will say,
p268
aVbut that doesn't add up to a lot,
p269
aVbut I'm actually asking you to do something really simple:
p270
aVobserve your environment,
p271
aVat work, at school, at home.
p272
aVI'm asking you to look at the people around you
p273
aVpurposefully and intentionally.
p274
aVInvite people into your life
p275
aVwho don't look like you, don't think like you,
p276
aVdon't act like you,
p277
aVdon't come from where you come from,
p278
aVand you might find that they will challenge your assumptions
p279
aVand make you grow as a person.
p280
aVYou might get powerful new insights
p281
aVfrom these individuals,
p282
aVor, like my husband, who happens to be white,
p283
aVyou might learn that black people,
p284
aVmen, women, children,
p285
aVwe use body lotion every single day.
p286
aa(lp287
VNow, I also think that this is very important
p288
aVso that the next generation really understands
p289
aVthat this progress will help them,
p290
aVbecause they're expecting us to be great role models.
p291
aa(lp292
VNow, I told you, my mother,
p293
aVshe was ruthlessly realistic.
p294
aVShe was an unbelievable role model.
p295
aVShe was the kind of person
p296
aVwho got to be the way she was
p297
aVbecause she was a single mom
p298
aVwith six kids in Chicago.
p299
aVShe was in the real estate business,
p300
aVwhere she worked extraordinarily hard
p301
aVbut oftentimes had a hard time making ends meet.
p302
aVAnd that meant sometimes we got
p303
aVour phone disconnected,
p304
aVor our lights turned off,
p305
aVor we got evicted.
p306
aVWhen we got evicted, sometimes we lived
p307
aVin these small apartments that she owned,
p308
aVsometimes in only one or two rooms,
p309
aVbecause they weren't completed,
p310
aVand we would heat our bathwater on hot plates.
p311
aVBut she never gave up hope, ever,
p312
aVand she never allowed us to give up hope either.
p313
aVThis brutal pragmatism that she had,
p314
aVI mean, I was four and she told me,
p315
aV"Mommy is Santa." (Laughter)
p316
aVShe was this brutal pragmatism.
p317
aVShe taught me so many lessons,
p318
aVbut the most important lesson
p319
aVwas that every single day she told me,
p320
aV"Mellody, you can be anything."
p321
aVAnd because of those words,
p322
aVI would wake up at the crack of dawn,
p323
aVand because of those words,
p324
aVI would love school more than anything,
p325
aVand because of those words, when I was on a bus
p326
aVgoing to school, I dreamed the biggest dreams.
p327
aVAnd it's because of those words that I stand here right now
p328
aVfull of passion,
p329
aVasking you to be brave for the kids
p330
aVwho are dreaming those dreams today.
p331
aV(Applause)
p332
aa(lp333
VYou see, I want them to look at a CEO on television
p334
aVand say, "I can be like her,"
p335
aVor, "He looks like me."
p336
aVAnd I want them to know
p337
aVthat anything is possible,
p338
aVthat they can achieve the highest level
p339
aVthat they ever imagined,
p340
aVthat they will be welcome in any corporate boardroom,
p341
aVor they can lead any company.
p342
aVYou see this idea of being the land
p343
aVof the free and the home of the brave,
p344
aVit's woven into the fabric of America.
p345
aVAmerica, when we have a challenge,
p346
aVwe take it head on, we don't shrink away from it.
p347
aVWe take a stand. We show courage.
p348
aVSo right now, what I'm asking you to do,
p349
aVI'm asking you to show courage.
p350
aVI'm asking you to be bold.
p351
aVAs business leaders, I'm asking you
p352
aVnot to leave anything on the table.
p353
aVAs citizens, I'm asking you not to leave any child behind.
p354
aVI'm asking you not to be color blind,
p355
aVbut to be color brave,
p356
aVso that every child knows that their future matters
p357
aVand their dreams are possible.
p358
aa(lp359
VThank you.
p360
aa(lp361

p362
aVThank you. Thanks. Thanks. (Applause)
