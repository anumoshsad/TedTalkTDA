VA computer is an incredibly powerful means
p4
aVof creative expression,
p5
aVbut for the most part,
p6
aVthat expression is confined to the screens
p7
aVof our laptops and mobile phones.
p8
aVAnd I'd like to tell you a story about
p9
aVbringing this power of the computer
p10
aVto move things around and interact with us
p11
aVoff of the screen and into the physical world
p12
aVin which we live.
p13
aa(lp14
VA few years ago, I got a call from
p15
aVa luxury fashion store called Barneys New York,
p16
aVand the next thing I knew,
p17
aVI was designing storefront kinetic sculptures
p18
aVfor their window displays.
p19
aa(lp20
VThis one's called "The Chase."
p21
aVThere are two pairs of shoes,
p22
aVa man's pair and a woman's pair,
p23
aVand they play out this slow, tense chase
p24
aVaround the window
p25
aVin which the man scoots up behind the woman
p26
aVand gets in her personal space,
p27
aVand then she moves away.
p28
aVEach of the shoes has magnets in it,
p29
aVand there are magnets underneath the table
p30
aVthat move the shoes around.
p31
aa(lp32
VMy friend Andy Cavatorta was building
p33
aVa robotic harp for Bjork's Biophilia tour
p34
aVand I wound up building the electronics
p35
aVand motion control software
p36
aVto make the harps move and play music.
p37
aVThe harp has four separate pendulums,
p38
aVand each pendulum has 11 strings,
p39
aVso the harp swings on its axis and also rotates
p40
aVin order to play different musical notes,
p41
aVand the harps are all networked together
p42
aVso that they can play the right notes
p43
aVat the right time in the music.
p44
aa(lp45
VI built an interactive chemistry exhibit
p46
aVat the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago,
p47
aVand this exhibit lets people use physical objects
p48
aVto grab chemical elements off of the periodic table
p49
aVand bring them together to cause
p50
aVchemical reactions to happen.
p51
aVAnd the museum noticed that people
p52
aVwere spending a lot of time with this exhibit,
p53
aVand a researcher from a science education center
p54
aVin Australia decided to study this exhibit
p55
aVand try to figure out what was going on.
p56
aVAnd she found that the physical objects
p57
aVthat people were using were helping people
p58
aVunderstand how to use the exhibit,
p59
aVand were helping people learn in a social way.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd when you think about it, this makes a lot of sense,
p62
aVthat using specialized physical objects
p63
aVwould help people use an interface more easily.
p64
aVI mean, our hands and our minds are optimized
p65
aVto think about and interact with tangible objects.
p66
aVThink about which you find easier to use,
p67
aVa physical keyboard or an onscreen keyboard
p68
aVlike on a phone?
p69
aa(lp70
VBut the thing that struck me
p71
aVabout all of these different projects
p72
aVis that they really had to be built from scratch,
p73
aVdown to the level of the electronics
p74
aVand the printed circuit boards and
p75
aVall the mechanisms all the way up to the software.
p76
aVI wanted to create something
p77
aVwhere we could move objects under computer control
p78
aVand create interactions around that idea
p79
aVwithout having to go through this process
p80
aVof building something from scratch
p81
aVevery single time.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo my first attempt at this
p84
aVwas at the MIT Media Lab
p85
aVwith Professor Hiroshi Ishii,
p86
aVand we built this array of
p87
aV512 different electromagnets,
p88
aVand together they were able to move objects around
p89
aVon top of their surface.
p90
aVBut the problem with this
p91
aVwas that these magnets
p92
aVcost over 10,000 dollars.
p93
aVAlthough each one was pretty small,
p94
aValtogether they weighed so much
p95
aVthat the table that they were on
p96
aVstarted to sag.
p97
aVSo I wanted to build something
p98
aVwhere you could have this kind of interaction
p99
aVon any tabletop surface.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo to explore this idea,
p102
aVI built an army of small robots,
p103
aVand each of these robots has what are called omni wheels.
p104
aVThey're these special wheels
p105
aVthat can move equally easily in all directions,
p106
aVand when you couple these robots
p107
aVwith a video projector,
p108
aVyou have these physical tools
p109
aVfor interacting with digital information.
p110
aVSo here's an example of what I mean.
p111
aVThis is a video editing application
p112
aVwhere all of the controls
p113
aVfor manipulating the video are physical.
p114
aVSo if we want to tweak the color,
p115
aVwe just enter the color mode,
p116
aVand then we get three different dials
p117
aVfor tweaking the color,
p118
aVor if we want to adjust the audio,
p119
aVthen we get two different dials for that, these physical objects.
p120
aVSo here the left and right channel stay in sync,
p121
aVbut if we want to, we can override that
p122
aVby grabbing both of them at the same time.
p123
aVSo the idea is that we get the speed
p124
aVand efficiency benefits of using these physical dials
p125
aVtogether with the flexibility and versatility
p126
aVof a system that's designed in software.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd this is a mapping application
p129
aVfor disaster response.
p130
aVSo you have these physical objects
p131
aVthat represent police, fire and rescue,
p132
aVand a dispatcher can grab them
p133
aVand place them on the map
p134
aVto tell those units where to go,
p135
aVand then the position of the units on the map
p136
aVgets synced up with the position
p137
aVof those units in the real world.
p138
aa(lp139
VThis is a video chat application.
p140
aVIt's amazing how much emotion you can convey
p141
aVwith just a few simple movements
p142
aVof a physical object.
p143
aa(lp144
VWith this interface, we open up a huge array of possibilities
p145
aVin between traditional board games
p146
aVand arcade games,
p147
aVwhere the physical possibilities of interaction
p148
aVmake so many different styles of play possible.
p149
aa(lp150
VBut one of the areas that I'm most excited
p151
aVabout using this platform for
p152
aVis applying it to problems that are difficult
p153
aVfor computers or people to solve alone.
p154
aVOne example of those is protein folding.
p155
aVSo here we have an interface
p156
aVwhere we have physical handles onto a protein,
p157
aVand we can grab those handles
p158
aVand try to move the protein and try to fold it in different ways.
p159
aVAnd if we move it in a way that doesn't really make sense
p160
aVwith the underlying molecular simulation,
p161
aVwe get this physical feedback where we can
p162
aVactually feel these physical handles
p163
aVpulling back against us.
p164
aVSo feeling what's going on
p165
aVinside a molecular simulation
p166
aVis a whole different level of interaction.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo we're just beginning to explore
p169
aVwhat's possible when we use software
p170
aVto control the movement
p171
aVof objects in our environment.
p172
aVMaybe this is the computer of the future.
p173
aVThere's no touchscreen.
p174
aVThere's no technology visible at all.
p175
aVBut when we want to have a video chat
p176
aVor play a game
p177
aVor lay out the slides to our next TED Talk,
p178
aVthe objects on the table come alive.
p179
