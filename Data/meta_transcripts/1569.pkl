VSo I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack,
p4
aVand all it requires of you is this:
p5
aVthat you change your posture for two minutes.
p6
aVBut before I give it away, I want to ask you to right now
p7
aVdo a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body.
p8
aVSo how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller?
p9
aVMaybe you're hunching, crossing your legs, maybe wrapping your ankles.
p10
aVSometimes we hold onto our arms like this.
p11
aVSometimes we spread out. (Laughter)
p12
aVI see you.
p13
aVSo I want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now.
p14
aVWe're going to come back to that in a few minutes,
p15
aVand I'm hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit,
p16
aVit could significantly change the way your life unfolds.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo, we're really fascinated with body language,
p19
aVand we're particularly interested in other people's body language.
p20
aVYou know, we're interested in, like, you know \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p21
aVan awkward interaction, or a smile,
p22
aVor a contemptuous glance, or maybe a very awkward wink,
p23
aVor maybe even something like a handshake.
p24
aa(lp25
VNarrator: Here they are arriving at Number 10.
p26
aVThis lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the President of the United States.
p27
aVHere comes the Prime Minister \u2014 No. (Laughter) (Applause)
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p30
aa(lp31
VAmy Cuddy: So a handshake, or the lack of a handshake,
p32
aVcan have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks.
p33
aVEven the BBC and The New York Times.
p34
aVSo obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior,
p35
aVor body language \u2014 but we call it nonverbals as social scientists \u2014
p36
aVit's language, so we think about communication.
p37
aVWhen we think about communication, we think about interactions.
p38
aVSo what is your body language communicating to me?
p39
aVWhat's mine communicating to you?
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd there's a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this.
p42
aVSo social scientists have spent a lot of time
p43
aVlooking at the effects of our body language,
p44
aVor other people's body language, on judgments.
p45
aVAnd we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language.
p46
aVAnd those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes
p47
aVlike who we hire or promote, who we ask out on a date.
p48
aVFor example, Nalini Ambady, a researcher at Tufts University,
p49
aVshows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips
p50
aVof real physician-patient interactions,
p51
aVtheir judgments of the physician's niceness
p52
aVpredict whether or not that physician will be sued.
p53
aVSo it doesn't have to do so much
p54
aVwith whether or not that physician was incompetent,
p55
aVbut do we like that person and how they interacted?
p56
aVEven more dramatic, Alex Todorov at Princeton
p57
aVhas shown us that judgments of political candidates' faces
p58
aVin just one second predict 70 percent
p59
aVof U.S. Senate and gubernatorial race outcomes,
p60
aVand even, let's go digital,
p61
aVemoticons used well in online negotiations
p62
aVcan lead you to claim more value from that negotiation.
p63
aVIf you use them poorly, bad idea. Right?
p64
aa(lp65
VSo when we think of nonverbals, we think of how we judge others,
p66
aVhow they judge us and what the outcomes are.
p67
aVWe tend to forget, though, the other audience
p68
aVthat's influenced by our nonverbals, and that's ourselves.
p69
aVWe are also influenced by our nonverbals,
p70
aVour thoughts and our feelings and our physiology.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo what nonverbals am I talking about?
p73
aVI'm a social psychologist. I study prejudice,
p74
aVand I teach at a competitive business school,
p75
aVso it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics.
p76
aVI became especially interested in nonverbal expressions
p77
aVof power and dominance.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance?
p80
aVWell, this is what they are.
p81
aVSo in the animal kingdom, they are about expanding.
p82
aVSo you make yourself big, you stretch out,
p83
aVyou take up space, you're basically opening up.
p84
aVIt's about opening up.
p85
aVAnd this is true across the animal kingdom.
p86
aVIt's not just limited to primates.
p87
aVAnd humans do the same thing. (Laughter)
p88
aVSo they do this both when they have power sort of chronically,
p89
aVand also when they're feeling powerful in the moment.
p90
aVAnd this one is especially interesting because it really shows us
p91
aVhow universal and old these expressions of power are.
p92
aVThis expression, which is known as pride,
p93
aVJessica Tracy has studied.
p94
aVShe shows that people who are born with sight
p95
aVand people who are congenitally blind do this
p96
aVwhen they win at a physical competition.
p97
aVSo when they cross the finish line and they've won,
p98
aVit doesn't matter if they've never seen anyone do it.
p99
aVThey do this.
p100
aVSo the arms up in the V, the chin is slightly lifted.
p101
aa(lp102
VWhat do we do when we feel powerless?
p103
aVWe do exactly the opposite.
p104
aVWe close up. We wrap ourselves up.
p105
aVWe make ourselves small.
p106
aVWe don't want to bump into the person next to us.
p107
aVSo again, both animals and humans do the same thing.
p108
aVAnd this is what happens when you put together high and low power.
p109
aVSo what we tend to do when it comes to power
p110
aVis that we complement the other's nonverbals.
p111
aVSo if someone is being really powerful with us,
p112
aVwe tend to make ourselves smaller. We don't mirror them.
p113
aVWe do the opposite of them.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo I'm watching this behavior in the classroom,
p116
aVand what do I notice?
p117
aVI notice that MBA students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals.
p118
aVSo you have people who are like caricatures of alphas,
p119
aVreally coming into the room, they get right into the middle of the room
p120
aVbefore class even starts, like they really want to occupy space.
p121
aVWhen they sit down, they're sort of spread out.
p122
aVThey raise their hands like this.
p123
aVYou have other people who are virtually collapsing
p124
aVwhen they come in. As soon they come in, you see it.
p125
aVYou see it on their faces and their bodies,
p126
aVand they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny,
p127
aVand they go like this when they raise their hand.
p128
aa(lp129
VI notice a couple of things about this.
p130
aVOne, you're not going to be surprised.
p131
aVIt seems to be related to gender.
p132
aVSo women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men.
p133
aVWomen feel chronically less powerful than men,
p134
aVso this is not surprising.
p135
aa(lp136
VBut the other thing I noticed
p137
aVis that it also seemed to be related to the extent
p138
aVto which the students were participating, and how well they were participating.
p139
aVAnd this is really important in the MBA classroom,
p140
aVbecause participation counts for half the grade.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap.
p143
aVYou get these equally qualified women and men coming in
p144
aVand then you get these differences in grades,
p145
aVand it seems to be partly attributable to participation.
p146
aVSo I started to wonder, you know, okay,
p147
aVso you have these people coming in like this, and they're participating.
p148
aVIs it possible that we could get people to fake it
p149
aVand would it lead them to participate more?
p150
aa(lp151
VSo my main collaborator Dana Carney, who's at Berkeley,
p152
aVand I really wanted to know, can you fake it till you make it?
p153
aVLike, can you do this just for a little while
p154
aVand actually experience a behavioral outcome
p155
aVthat makes you seem more powerful?
p156
aVSo we know that our nonverbals govern how other people
p157
aVthink and feel about us. There's a lot of evidence.
p158
aVBut our question really was,
p159
aVdo our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves?
p160
aa(lp161
VThere's some evidence that they do.
p162
aVSo, for example, we smile when we feel happy,
p163
aVbut also, when we're forced to smile
p164
aVby holding a pen in our teeth like this, it makes us feel happy.
p165
aVSo it goes both ways.
p166
aVWhen it comes to power, it also goes both ways.
p167
aVSo when you feel powerful,
p168
aVyou're more likely to do this,
p169
aVbut it's also possible that when you pretend to be powerful,
p170
aVyou are more likely to actually feel powerful.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo the second question really was, you know,
p173
aVso we know that our minds change our bodies,
p174
aVbut is it also true that our bodies change our minds?
p175
aVAnd when I say minds, in the case of the powerful,
p176
aVwhat am I talking about?
p177
aVSo I'm talking about thoughts and feelings
p178
aVand the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings,
p179
aVand in my case, that's hormones. I look at hormones.
p180
aVSo what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like?
p181
aVSo powerful people tend to be, not surprisingly,
p182
aVmore assertive and more confident, more optimistic.
p183
aVThey actually feel they're going to win even at games of chance.
p184
aVThey also tend to be able to think more abstractly.
p185
aVSo there are a lot of differences. They take more risks.
p186
aVThere are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people.
p187
aVPhysiologically, there also are differences
p188
aVon two key hormones: testosterone, which is the dominance hormone,
p189
aVand cortisol, which is the stress hormone.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo what we find is that high-power alpha males in primate hierarchies
p192
aVhave high testosterone and low cortisol,
p193
aVand powerful and effective leaders
p194
aValso have high testosterone and low cortisol.
p195
aVSo what does that mean? When you think about power,
p196
aVpeople tended to think only about testosterone,
p197
aVbecause that was about dominance.
p198
aVBut really, power is also about how you react to stress.
p199
aVSo do you want the high-power leader that's dominant,
p200
aVhigh on testosterone, but really stress reactive?
p201
aVProbably not, right?
p202
aVYou want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant,
p203
aVbut not very stress reactive, the person who's laid back.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo we know that in primate hierarchies,
p206
aVif an alpha needs to take over,
p207
aVif an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly,
p208
aVwithin a few days, that individual's testosterone has gone up
p209
aVsignificantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly.
p210
aVSo we have this evidence, both that the body can shape
p211
aVthe mind, at least at the facial level,
p212
aVand also that role changes can shape the mind.
p213
aVSo what happens, okay, you take a role change,
p214
aVwhat happens if you do that at a really minimal level,
p215
aVlike this tiny manipulation, this tiny intervention?
p216
aV"For two minutes," you say, "I want you to stand like this,
p217
aVand it's going to make you feel more powerful."
p218
aa(lp219
VSo this is what we did.
p220
aVWe decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment,
p221
aVand these people adopted, for two minutes,
p222
aVeither high-power poses or low-power poses,
p223
aVand I'm just going to show you five of the poses,
p224
aValthough they took on only two.
p225
aVSo here's one.
p226
aVA couple more.
p227
aVThis one has been dubbed the "Wonder Woman" by the media.
p228
aVHere are a couple more.
p229
aVSo you can be standing or you can be sitting.
p230
aVAnd here are the low-power poses.
p231
aVSo you're folding up, you're making yourself small.
p232
aVThis one is very low-power.
p233
aVWhen you're touching your neck, you're really protecting yourself.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo this is what happens.
p236
aVThey come in, they spit into a vial,
p237
aVfor two minutes, we say, "You need to do this or this."
p238
aVThey don't look at pictures of the poses.
p239
aVWe don't want to prime them with a concept of power.
p240
aVWe want them to be feeling power.
p241
aVSo two minutes they do this.
p242
aVWe then ask them, "How powerful do you feel?" on a series of items,
p243
aVand then we give them an opportunity to gamble,
p244
aVand then we take another saliva sample.
p245
aVThat's it. That's the whole experiment.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo this is what we find.
p248
aVRisk tolerance, which is the gambling,
p249
aVwe find that when you are in the high-power pose condition,
p250
aV86 percent of you will gamble.
p251
aVWhen you're in the low-power pose condition,
p252
aVonly 60 percent, and that's a whopping significant difference.
p253
aa(lp254
VHere's what we find on testosterone.
p255
aVFrom their baseline when they come in,
p256
aVhigh-power people experience about a 20-percent increase,
p257
aVand low-power people experience about a 10-percent decrease.
p258
aVSo again, two minutes, and you get these changes.
p259
aVHere's what you get on cortisol.
p260
aVHigh-power people experience about a 25-percent decrease,
p261
aVand the low-power people experience about a 15-percent increase.
p262
aVSo two minutes lead to these hormonal changes
p263
aVthat configure your brain
p264
aVto basically be either assertive, confident and comfortable,
p265
aVor really stress-reactive, and feeling sort of shut down.
p266
aVAnd we've all had the feeling, right?
p267
aVSo it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves,
p268
aVso it's not just others, but it's also ourselves.
p269
aVAlso, our bodies change our minds.
p270
aa(lp271
VBut the next question, of course,
p272
aVis, can power posing for a few minutes
p273
aVreally change your life in meaningful ways?
p274
aVThis is in the lab, it's this little task, it's just a couple of minutes.
p275
aVWhere can you actually apply this?
p276
aVWhich we cared about, of course.
p277
aVAnd so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations,
p278
aVlike social threat situations.
p279
aVWhere are you being evaluated, either by your friends?
p280
aVFor teenagers, it's at the lunchroom table.
p281
aVFor some people it's speaking at a school board meeting.
p282
aVIt might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this
p283
aVor doing a job interview.
p284
aVWe decided that the one that most people could relate to
p285
aVbecause most people had been through, was the job interview.
p286
aa(lp287
VSo we published these findings,
p288
aVand the media are all over it,
p289
aVand they say, Okay, so this is what you do
p290
aVwhen you go in for the job interview, right?
p291
aa(lp292
V(Laughter)
p293
aa(lp294
VYou know, so we were of course horrified, and said,
p295
aVOh my God, no, that's not what we meant at all.
p296
aVFor numerous reasons, no, don't do that.
p297
aVAgain, this is not about you talking to other people.
p298
aVIt's you talking to yourself.
p299
aVWhat do you do before you go into a job interview? You do this.
p300
aVYou're sitting down. You're looking at your iPhone \u2014
p301
aVor your Android, not trying to leave anyone out.
p302
aVYou're looking at your notes,
p303
aVyou're hunching up, making yourself small,
p304
aVwhen really what you should be doing maybe is this,
p305
aVlike, in the bathroom, right? Do that. Find two minutes.
p306
aVSo that's what we want to test. Okay?
p307
aVSo we bring people into a lab,
p308
aVand they do either high- or low-power poses again,
p309
aVthey go through a very stressful job interview.
p310
aVIt's five minutes long. They are being recorded.
p311
aVThey're being judged also,
p312
aVand the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback,
p313
aVso they look like this.
p314
aVImagine this is the person interviewing you.
p315
aVSo for five minutes, nothing, and this is worse than being heckled.
p316
aVPeople hate this.
p317
aVIt's what Marianne LaFrance calls "standing in social quicksand."
p318
aVSo this really spikes your cortisol.
p319
aVSo this is the job interview we put them through,
p320
aVbecause we really wanted to see what happened.
p321
aVWe then have these coders look at these tapes, four of them.
p322
aVThey're blind to the hypothesis. They're blind to the conditions.
p323
aVThey have no idea who's been posing in what pose,
p324
aVand they end up looking at these sets of tapes,
p325
aVand they say, "We want to hire these people,"
p326
aVall the high-power posers.
p327
aV"We don't want to hire these people.
p328
aVWe also evaluate these people much more positively overall."
p329
aVBut what's driving it?
p330
aVIt's not about the content of the speech.
p331
aVIt's about the presence that they're bringing to the speech.
p332
aVBecause we rate them on all these variables
p333
aVrelated to competence, like, how well-structured is the speech?
p334
aVHow good is it? What are their qualifications?
p335
aVNo effect on those things. This is what's affected.
p336
aVThese kinds of things.
p337
aVPeople are bringing their true selves, basically.
p338
aVThey're bringing themselves.
p339
aVThey bring their ideas, but as themselves,
p340
aVwith no, you know, residue over them.
p341
aVSo this is what's driving the effect, or mediating the effect.
p342
aa(lp343
VSo when I tell people about this,
p344
aVthat our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior,
p345
aVand our behavior can change our outcomes, they say to me,
p346
aV"It feels fake." Right?
p347
aVSo I said, fake it till you make it.
p348
aVIt's not me.
p349
aVI don't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud.
p350
aVI don't want to feel like an impostor.
p351
aVI don't want to get there only to feel like I'm not supposed to be here.
p352
aVAnd that really resonated with me,
p353
aVbecause I want to tell you a little story about being an impostor
p354
aVand feeling like I'm not supposed to be here.
p355
aa(lp356
VWhen I was 19, I was in a really bad car accident.
p357
aVI was thrown out of a car, rolled several times.
p358
aVI was thrown from the car.
p359
aVAnd I woke up in a head injury rehab ward,
p360
aVand I had been withdrawn from college,
p361
aVand I learned that my IQ had dropped by two standard deviations,
p362
aVwhich was very traumatic.
p363
aVI knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart,
p364
aVand I had been called gifted as a child.
p365
aVSo I'm taken out of college, I keep trying to go back.
p366
aVThey say, "You're not going to finish college.
p367
aVJust, you know, there are other things for you to do,
p368
aVbut that's not going to work out for you."
p369
aa(lp370
VSo I really struggled with this, and I have to say,
p371
aVhaving your identity taken from you, your core identity,
p372
aVand for me it was being smart,
p373
aVhaving that taken from you,
p374
aVthere's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that.
p375
aVSo I felt entirely powerless.
p376
aVI worked and worked, and I got lucky,
p377
aVand worked, and got lucky, and worked.
p378
aa(lp379
VEventually I graduated from college.
p380
aVIt took me four years longer than my peers,
p381
aVand I convinced someone, my angel advisor, Susan Fiske,
p382
aVto take me on, and so I ended up at Princeton,
p383
aVand I was like, I am not supposed to be here.
p384
aVI am an impostor.
p385
aVAnd the night before my first-year talk,
p386
aVand the first-year talk at Princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people.
p387
aVThat's it.
p388
aVI was so afraid of being found out the next day
p389
aVthat I called her and said, "I'm quitting."
p390
aVShe was like, "You are not quitting,
p391
aVbecause I took a gamble on you, and you're staying.
p392
aVYou're going to stay, and this is what you're going to do.
p393
aVYou are going to fake it.
p394
aVYou're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do.
p395
aVYou're just going to do it and do it and do it,
p396
aVeven if you're terrified and just paralyzed
p397
aVand having an out-of-body experience,
p398
aVuntil you have this moment where you say, 'Oh my gosh, I'm doing it.
p399
aVLike, I have become this. I am actually doing this.'"
p400
aVSo that's what I did.
p401
aVFive years in grad school,
p402
aVa few years, you know, I'm at Northwestern,
p403
aVI moved to Harvard, I'm at Harvard,
p404
aVI'm not really thinking about it anymore, but for a long time I had been thinking,
p405
aV"Not supposed to be here."
p406
aa(lp407
VSo at the end of my first year at Harvard,
p408
aVa student who had not talked in class the entire semester,
p409
aVwho I had said, "Look, you've gotta participate or else you're going to fail,"
p410
aVcame into my office. I really didn't know her at all.
p411
aVShe came in totally defeated, and she said,
p412
aV"I'm not supposed to be here."
p413
aVAnd that was the moment for me.
p414
aVBecause two things happened.
p415
aVOne was that I realized,
p416
aVoh my gosh, I don't feel like that anymore.
p417
aVI don't feel that anymore, but she does, and I get that feeling.
p418
aVAnd the second was, she is supposed to be here!
p419
aVLike, she can fake it, she can become it.
p420
aa(lp421
VSo I was like, "Yes, you are! You are supposed to be here!
p422

p432
aa(lp433
VShe comes back to me months later,
p434
aVand I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it,
p435
aVshe had actually faked it till she became it.

VSo I want to ask you first, you know, both to try power posing,
p456
aVand also I want to ask you to share the science, because this is simple.
p457
aVI don't have ego involved in this. (Laughter)
p458

aVbecause the people who can use it the most
p460
aVare the ones with no resources and no technology
p461
aVand no status and no power.
p462
aVGive it to them because they can do it in private.
