VYou probably don't know me,
p4
aVbut I am one of those .01 percenters
p5
aVthat you hear about and read about,
p6
aVand I am by any reasonable definition a plutocrat.
p7
aVAnd tonight, what I would like to do is speak directly
p8
aVto other plutocrats, to my people,
p9
aVbecause it feels like it's time for us all
p10
aVto have a chat.
p11
aVLike most plutocrats, I too am a proud
p12
aVand unapologetic capitalist.
p13
aVI have founded, cofounded or funded
p14
aVover 30 companies across a range of industries.
p15
aVI was the first non-family investor in Amazon.com.
p16
aVI cofounded a company called aQuantive
p17
aVthat we sold to Microsoft for 6.4 billion dollars.
p18
aVMy friends and I, we own a bank.
p19
aVI tell you this \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p20
aVunbelievable, right?
p21
aa(lp22
VI tell you this to show
p23
aVthat my life is like most plutocrats.
p24
aVI have a broad perspective on capitalism
p25
aVand business,
p26
aVand I have been rewarded obscenely for that
p27
aVwith a life that most of you all
p28
aVcan't even imagine:
p29
aVmultiple homes, a yacht, my own plane,
p30
aVetc., etc., etc.
p31
aVBut let's be honest: I am not the smartest person you've ever met.
p32
aVI am certainly not the hardest working.
p33
aVI was a mediocre student.
p34
aVI'm not technical at all.
p35
aVI can't write a word of code.
p36
aVTruly, my success is the consequence
p37
aVof spectacular luck,
p38
aVof birth, of circumstance and of timing.
p39
aVBut I am actually pretty good at a couple of things.
p40
aVOne, I have an unusually high tolerance for risk,
p41
aVand the other is I have a good sense,
p42
aVa good intuition about what will happen in the future,
p43
aVand I think that that intuition about the future
p44
aVis the essence of good entrepreneurship.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo what do I see in our future today,
p47
aVyou ask?
p48
aVI see pitchforks,
p49
aVas in angry mobs with pitchforks,
p50
aVbecause while people like us plutocrats
p51
aVare living beyond the dreams of avarice,
p52
aVthe other 99 percent of our fellow citizens
p53
aVare falling farther and farther behind.
p54
aVIn 1980, the top one percent of Americans
p55
aVshared about eight percent of national [income],
p56
aVwhile the bottom 50 percent of Americans
p57
aVshared 18 percent.
p58
aVThirty years later, today, the top one percent
p59
aVshares over 20 percent of national [income],
p60
aVwhile the bottom 50 percent of Americans
p61
aVshare 12 or 13.
p62
aVIf the trend continues,
p63
aVthe top one percent will share
p64
aVover 30 percent of national [income]
p65
aVin another 30 years,
p66
aVwhile the bottom 50 percent of Americans
p67
aVwill share just six.
p68
aa(lp69
VYou see, the problem isn't that we have
p70
aVsome inequality.
p71
aVSome inequality is necessary
p72
aVfor a high-functioning capitalist democracy.
p73
aVThe problem is that inequality
p74
aVis at historic highs today
p75
aVand it's getting worse every day.
p76
aVAnd if wealth, power, and income
p77
aVcontinue to concentrate
p78
aVat the very tippy top,
p79
aVour society will change
p80
aVfrom a capitalist democracy
p81
aVto a neo-feudalist rentier society
p82
aVlike 18th-century France.
p83
aVThat was France
p84
aVbefore the revolution
p85
aVand the mobs with the pitchforks.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo I have a message for my fellow plutocrats
p88
aVand zillionaires
p89
aVand for anyone who lives
p90
aVin a gated bubble world:
p91
aVWake up.
p92
aVWake up. It cannot last.
p93
aVBecause if we do not do something
p94
aVto fix the glaring economic inequities in our society,
p95
aVthe pitchforks will come for us,
p96
aVfor no free and open society can long sustain
p97
aVthis kind of rising economic inequality.
p98
aVIt has never happened. There are no examples.
p99
aVYou show me a highly unequal society,
p100
aVand I will show you a police state
p101
aVor an uprising.
p102
aVThe pitchforks will come for us
p103
aVif we do not address this.
p104
aVIt's not a matter of if, it's when.
p105
aVAnd it will be terrible when they come
p106
aVfor everyone,
p107
aVbut particularly for people like us plutocrats.
p108
aa(lp109
VI know I must sound like some liberal do-gooder.
p110
aVI'm not. I'm not making a moral argument
p111
aVthat economic inequality is wrong.
p112
aVWhat I am arguing is that rising economic inequality
p113
aVis stupid and ultimately self-defeating.
p114
aVRising inequality doesn't just increase our risks
p115
aVfrom pitchforks,
p116
aVbut it's also terrible for business too.
p117
aVSo the model for us rich guys should be Henry Ford.
p118
aVWhen Ford famously introduced the $5 day,
p119
aVwhich was twice the prevailing wage at the time,
p120
aVhe didn't just increase the productivity
p121
aVof his factories,
p122
aVhe converted exploited autoworkers who were poor
p123
aVinto a thriving middle class who could now afford
p124
aVto buy the products that they made.
p125
aVFord intuited what we now know is true,
p126
aVthat an economy is best understood as an ecosystem
p127
aVand characterized by the same kinds
p128
aVof feedback loops you find
p129
aVin a natural ecosystem,
p130
aVa feedback loop between customers and businesses.
p131
aVRaising wages increases demand,
p132
aVwhich increases hiring,
p133
aVwhich in turn increases wages
p134
aVand demand and profits,
p135
aVand that virtuous cycle of increasing prosperity
p136
aVis precisely what is missing
p137
aVfrom today's economic recovery.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd this is why we need to put behind us
p140
aVthe trickle-down policies that so dominate
p141
aVboth political parties
p142
aVand embrace something I call middle-out economics.
p143
aVMiddle-out economics rejects
p144
aVthe neoclassical economic idea
p145
aVthat economies are efficient, linear, mechanistic,
p146
aVthat they tend towards equilibrium and fairness,
p147
aVand instead embraces the 21st-century idea
p148
aVthat economies are complex, adaptive,
p149
aVecosystemic,
p150
aVthat they tend away from equilibrium and toward inequality,
p151
aVthat they're not efficient at all
p152
aVbut are effective if well managed.
p153
aVThis 21st-century perspective
p154
aVallows you to clearly see that capitalism
p155
aVdoes not work by [efficiently] allocating
p156
aVexisting resources.
p157
aVIt works by [efficiently] creating new solutions
p158
aVto human problems.
p159
aVThe genius of capitalism
p160
aVis that it is an evolutionary solution-finding system.
p161
aVIt rewards people for solving other people's problems.
p162
aVThe difference between a poor society
p163
aVand a rich society, obviously,
p164
aVis the degree to which that society
p165
aVhas generated solutions in the form
p166
aVof products for its citizens.
p167
aVThe sum of the solutions
p168
aVthat we have in our society
p169
aVreally is our prosperity, and this explains
p170
aVwhy companies like Google and Amazon
p171
aVand Microsoft and Apple
p172
aVand the entrepreneurs who created those companies
p173
aVhave contributed so much
p174
aVto our nation's prosperity.
p175
aa(lp176
VThis 21st-century perspective
p177
aValso makes clear
p178
aVthat what we think of as economic growth
p179
aVis best understood as
p180
aVthe rate at which we solve problems.
p181
aVBut that rate is totally dependent upon
p182
aVhow many problem solvers \u2014
p183
aVdiverse, able problem solvers \u2014 we have,
p184
aVand thus how many of our fellow citizens
p185
aVactively participate,
p186
aVboth as entrepreneurs who can offer solutions,
p187
aVand as customers who consume them.
p188
aVBut this maximizing participation thing
p189
aVdoesn't happen by accident.
p190
aVIt doesn't happen by itself.
p191
aVIt requires effort and investment,
p192
aVwhich is why all
p193
aVhighly prosperous capitalist democracies
p194
aVare characterized by massive investments
p195
aVin the middle class and the infrastructure
p196
aVthat they depend on.
p197
aa(lp198
VWe plutocrats need to get this
p199
aVtrickle-down economics thing behind us,
p200
aVthis idea that the better we do,
p201
aVthe better everyone else will do.
p202
aVIt's not true. How could it be?
p203
aVI earn 1,000 times the median wage,
p204
aVbut I do not buy 1,000 times as much stuff,
p205
aVdo I?
p206
aVI actually bought two pairs of these pants,
p207
aVwhat my partner Mike calls
p208
aVmy manager pants.
p209
aVI could have bought 2,000 pairs,
p210
aVbut what would I do with them? (Laughter)
p211
aVHow many haircuts can I get?
p212
aVHow often can I go out to dinner?
p213
aVNo matter how wealthy a few plutocrats get,
p214
aVwe can never drive a great national economy.
p215
aVOnly a thriving middle class can do that.
p216
aVThere's nothing to be done,
p217
aVmy plutocrat friends might say.
p218
aVHenry Ford was in a different time.
p219
aVMaybe we can't do some things.
p220
aVMaybe we can do some things.
p221
aVJune 19, 2013,
p222
aVBloomberg published an article I wrote called
p223
aV"The Capitalist\u2019s Case for a $15 Minimum Wage."
p224
aVThe good people at Forbes magazine,
p225
aVamong my biggest admirers,
p226
aVcalled it "Nick Hanauer's near-insane proposal."
p227
aVAnd yet, just 350 days
p228
aVafter that article was published,
p229
aVSeattle's Mayor Ed Murray signed into law
p230
aVan ordinance raising the minimum wage in Seattle
p231
aVto 15 dollars an hour,
p232
aVmore than double
p233
aVwhat the prevailing federal $7.25 rate is.
p234
aVHow did this happen,
p235
aVreasonable people might ask.
p236
aVIt happened because a group of us
p237
aVreminded the middle class
p238
aVthat they are the source
p239
aVof growth and prosperity in capitalist economies.
p240
aVWe reminded them that when workers have more money,
p241
aVbusinesses have more customers,
p242
aVand need more employees.
p243
aVWe reminded them that when businesses
p244
aVpay workers a living wage,
p245
aVtaxpayers are relieved of the burden
p246
aVof funding the poverty programs
p247
aVlike food stamps and medical assistance
p248
aVand rent assistance
p249
aVthat those workers need.
p250
aVWe reminded them that low-wage workers
p251
aVmake terrible taxpayers,
p252
aVand that when you raise the minimum wage
p253
aVfor all businesses,
p254
aVall businesses benefit
p255
aVyet all can compete.
p256
aa(lp257
VNow the orthodox reaction, of course,
p258
aVis raising the minimum wage costs jobs. Right?
p259
aVYour politician's always echoing
p260
aVthat trickle-down idea by saying things like,
p261
aV"Well, if you raise the price of employment,
p262
aVguess what happens? You get less of it."
p263
aa(lp264
VAre you sure?
p265
aVBecause there's some contravening evidence.
p266
aVSince 1980, the wages of CEOs in our country
p267
aVhave gone from about 30 times the median wage
p268
aVto 500 times.
p269
aVThat's raising the price of employment.
p270
aVAnd yet, to my knowledge,
p271
aVI have never seen a company
p272
aVoutsource its CEO's job, automate their job,
p273
aVexport the job to China.
p274
aVIn fact, we appear to be employing
p275
aVmore CEOs and senior managers than ever before.
p276
aVSo too for technology workers
p277
aVand financial services workers,
p278
aVwho earn multiples of the median wage
p279
aVand yet we employ more and more of them,
p280
aVso clearly you can raise the price of employment
p281
aVand get more of it.
p282
aa(lp283
VI know that most people
p284
aVthink that the $15 minimum wage
p285
aVis this insane, risky economic experiment.
p286
aVWe disagree.
p287
aVWe believe that the $15 minimum wage
p288
aVin Seattle
p289
aVis actually the continuation
p290
aVof a logical economic policy.
p291
aVIt is allowing our city
p292
aVto kick your city's ass.
p293
aVBecause, you see,
p294
aVWashington state already has
p295
aVthe highest minimum wage
p296
aVof any state in the nation.
p297
aVWe pay all workers $9.32,
p298
aVwhich is almost 30 percent more
p299
aVthan the federal minimum of 7.25,
p300
aVbut crucially, 427 percent more
p301
aVthan the federal tipped minimum of 2.13.
p302
aVIf trickle-down thinkers were right,
p303
aVthen Washington state should have massive unemployment.
p304
aVSeattle should be sliding into the ocean.
p305
aVAnd yet, Seattle
p306
aVis the fastest-growing big city in the country.
p307
aVWashington state is generating small business jobs
p308
aVat a higher rate than any other major state
p309
aVin the nation.
p310
aVThe restaurant business in Seattle? Booming.
p311
aVWhy? Because the fundamental law of capitalism is,
p312
aVwhen workers have more money,
p313
aVbusinesses have more customers
p314
aVand need more workers.
p315
aVWhen restaurants pay restaurant workers enough
p316
aVso that even they can afford to eat in restaurants,
p317
aVthat's not bad for the restaurant business.
p318
aVThat's good for it,
p319
aVdespite what some restaurateurs may tell you.
p320
aa(lp321
VIs it more complicated than I'm making out?
p322
aVOf course it is.
p323
aVThere are a lot of dynamics at play.
p324
aVBut can we please stop insisting
p325
aVthat if low-wage workers earn a little bit more,
p326
aVunemployment will skyrocket
p327
aVand the economy will collapse?
p328
aVThere is no evidence for it.
p329
aVThe most insidious thing
p330
aVabout trickle-down economics
p331
aVis not the claim that if the rich get richer,
p332
aVeveryone is better off.
p333
aVIt is the claim made by those who oppose
p334
aVany increase in the minimum wage
p335
aVthat if the poor get richer,
p336
aVthat will be bad for the economy.
p337
aVThis is nonsense.
p338
aVSo can we please dispense with this rhetoric
p339
aVthat says that rich guys like me
p340
aVand my plutocrat friends
p341
aVmade our country?
p342
aVWe plutocrats know,
p343
aVeven if we don't like to admit it in public,
p344
aVthat if we had been born somewhere else,
p345
aVnot here in the United States,
p346
aVwe might very well be just some dude standing barefoot
p347
aVby the side of a dirt road selling fruit.
p348
aVIt's not that they don't have good entrepreneurs in other places,
p349
aVeven very, very poor places.
p350
aVIt's just that that's all
p351
aVthat those entrepreneurs' customers can afford.
p352
aa(lp353
VSo here's an idea for a new kind of economics,
p354
aVa new kind of politics
p355
aVthat I call new capitalism.
p356
aVLet's acknowledge that capitalism
p357
aVbeats the alternatives,
p358
aVbut also that the more people we include,
p359
aVboth as entrepreneurs and as customers,
p360
aVthe better it works.
p361
aVLet's by all means shrink the size of government,
p362
aVbut not by slashing the poverty programs,
p363
aVbut by ensuring that workers are paid enough
p364
aVso that they actually don't need those programs.
p365
aVLet's invest enough in the middle class
p366
aVto make our economy fairer and more inclusive,
p367
aVand by fairer, more truly competitive,
p368
aVand by more truly competitive,
p369
aVmore able to generate the solutions
p370
aVto human problems
p371
aVthat are the true drivers of growth and prosperity.
p372
aVCapitalism is the greatest social technology
p373
aVever invented
p374
aVfor creating prosperity in human societies,
p375
aVif it is well managed,
p376
aVbut capitalism, because of the fundamental
p377
aVmultiplicative dynamics of complex systems,
p378
aVtends towards, inexorably, inequality,
p379
aVconcentration and collapse.
p380
aVThe work of democracies
p381
aVis to maximize the inclusion of the many
p382
aVin order to create prosperity,
p383
aVnot to enable the few to accumulate money.
p384
aVGovernment does create prosperity and growth,
p385
aVby creating the conditions that allow
p386
aVboth entrepreneurs and their customers
p387
aVto thrive.
p388
aVBalancing the power of capitalists like me
p389
aVand workers isn't bad for capitalism.
p390
aVIt's essential to it.
p391
aVPrograms like a reasonable minimum wage,
p392
aVaffordable healthcare,
p393
aVpaid sick leave,
p394
aVand the progressive taxation necessary
p395
aVto pay for the important infrastructure
p396
aVnecessary for the middle class like education, R and D,
p397
aVthese are indispensable tools
p398
aVshrewd capitalists should embrace
p399
aVto drive growth, because no one benefits from it
p400
aVlike us.
p401
aa(lp402
VMany economists would have you believe
p403
aVthat their field is an objective science.
p404
aVI disagree, and I think that it is equally
p405
aVa tool that humans use
p406
aVto enforce and encode
p407
aVour social and moral preferences and prejudices
p408
aVabout status and power,
p409
aVwhich is why plutocrats like me
p410
aVhave always needed to find persuasive stories
p411
aVto tell everyone else
p412
aVabout why our relative positions
p413
aVare morally righteous and good for everyone:
p414
aVlike, we are indispensable, the job creators,
p415
aVand you are not;
p416
aVlike, tax cuts for us create growth,
p417
aVbut investments in you
p418
aVwill balloon our debt
p419
aVand bankrupt our great country;
p420
aVthat we matter;
p421
aVthat you don't.
p422
aVFor thousands of years, these stories were called
p423
aVdivine right.
p424
aVToday, we have trickle-down economics.
p425
aVHow obviously, transparently self-serving
p426
aVall of this is.
p427
aVWe plutocrats need to see
p428
aVthat the United States of America made us,
p429
aVnot the other way around;
p430
aVthat a thriving middle class is the source
p431
aVof prosperity in capitalist economies,
p432
aVnot a consequence of it.
p433
aVAnd we should never forget
p434
aVthat even the best of us in the worst of circumstances
p435
aVare barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit.
p436
aa(lp437
VFellow plutocrats, I think it may be time for us
p438
aVto recommit to our country,
p439
aVto commit to a new kind of capitalism
p440
aVwhich is both more inclusive and more effective,
p441
aVa capitalism that will ensure
p442
aVthat America's economy remains
p443
aVthe most dynamic and prosperous in the world.
p444
aVLet's secure the future for ourselves,
p445
aVour children and their children.
p446
aVOr alternatively, we could do nothing,
p447
aVhide in our gated communities
p448
aVand private schools,
p449
aVenjoy our planes and yachts
p450
aV\u2014 they're fun \u2014
