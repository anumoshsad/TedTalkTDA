VWell, good morning.
p4
aVYou know, the computer and television both recently turned 60,
p5
aVand today I'd like to talk about their relationship.
p6
aVDespite their middle age, if you've been following the themes
p7
aVof this conference or the entertainment industry,
p8
aVit's pretty clear that one has been picking on the other.
p9
aVSo it's about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television,
p10
aVor why the invention of the atomic bomb
p11
aVunleashed forces that lead to the writers' strike.
p12
aVAnd it's not just what these are doing to each other,
p13
aVbut it's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter.
p14
aa(lp15
VTo get a sense of this,
p16
aVand it's been a theme we've talked about all week,
p17
aVI recently talked to a bunch of tweeners.
p18
aVI wrote on cards: "television," "radio," "MySpace," "Internet," "PC."
p19
aVAnd I said, just arrange these, from what's important to you
p20
aVand what's not, and then tell me why.
p21
aVLet's listen to what happens when they get to the portion
p22
aVof the discussion on television.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Video) Girl 1: Well, I think it's important but, like, not necessary
p25
aVbecause you can do a lot of other stuff with your free time than watch programs.
p26
aa(lp27
VPeter Hirshberg: Which is more fun, Internet or TV?
p28
aa(lp29
VGirls: Internet.
p30
aVGirl 2: I think we \u2014 the reasons, one of the reasons we put computer before TV
p31
aVis because nowadays, like, we have TV shows on the computer.
p32
aV(Girl 3: Oh, yeah.)
p33
aVGirl 2: And then you can download onto your iPod.
p34
aa(lp35
VPH: Would you like to be the president of a TV network?
p36
aa(lp37
VGirl 4: I wouldn't like it.
p38
aVGirl 2: That would be so stressful.
p39
aVGirl 5: No.
p40
aa(lp41
VPH: How come?
p42
aa(lp43
VGirl 5: Because they're going to lose all their money eventually.
p44
aVGirl 3: Like the stock market, it goes up and down and stuff.
p45
aVI think right now the computers will be at the top
p46
aVand everything will be kind of going down and stuff.
p47
aa(lp48
VPH: There's been an uneasy relationship between the TV business
p49
aVand the tech business, really ever since they both turned about 30.
p50
aVWe go through periods of enthrallment,
p51
aVfollowed by reactions in boardrooms, in the finance community
p52
aVbest characterized as, what's the finance term? Ick pooey.
p53
aa(lp54
VLet me give you an example of this. The year is 1976,
p55
aVand Warner buys Atari because video games are on the rise.
p56
aVThe next year they march forward and they introduce Qube,
p57
aVthe first interactive cable TV system,
p58
aVand the New York Times heralds this
p59
aVas telecommunications moving to the home,
p60
aVconvergence, great things are happening.
p61
aVEverybody in the East Coast gets in the pictures \u2014
p62
aVCiticorp, Penney, RCA \u2014 all getting into this big vision.
p63
aVBy the way, this is about when I enter the picture.
p64
aVI'm going to do a summer internship at Time Warner.
p65
aVThat summer I'm all \u2014 I'm at Warner that summer \u2014
p66
aVI'm all excited to work on convergence, and then the bottom falls out.
p67
aVDoesn't work out too well for them, they lose money.
p68
aVAnd I had a happy brush with convergence
p69
aVuntil, kind of, Warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing.
p70
aa(lp71
VThat's when I leave graduate school, and I can't work in New York
p72
aVon kind of entertainment and technology
p73
aVbecause I have to be exiled to California, where the remaining jobs are,
p74
aValmost to the sea, to go to work for Apple Computer.
p75
aVWarner, of course, writes off more than 400 million dollars.
p76
aVFour hundred million dollars, which was real money back in the '70s.
p77
aVBut they were onto something and they got better at it.
p78
aVBy the year 2000, the process was perfected. They merged with AOL,
p79
aVand in just four years, managed to shed about 200 billion dollars
p80
aVof market capitalization, showing that they'd actually mastered the art
p81
aVof applying Moore's law of successive miniaturization
p82
aVto their balance sheet.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VNow, I think that one reason that the media and the entertainment communities,
p87
aVor the media community, is driven so crazy by the tech community
p88
aVis that tech folks talk differently.
p89
aVYou know, for 50 years, we've talked about changing the world,
p90
aVabout total transformation.
p91
aVFor 50 years, it's been about hopes and fears
p92
aVand promises of a better world. And I got to thinking,
p93
aVyou know, who else talks that way?
p94
aVAnd the answer is pretty clearly \u2014
p95
aVit's people in religion and in politics.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd so I realized that actually the tech world is best understood,
p98
aVnot as a business cycle, but as a messianic movement.
p99
aVWe promise something great, we evangelize it,
p100
aVwe're going to change the world. It doesn't work out too well,
p101
aVand so we actually go back to the well and start all over again,
p102
aVas the people in New York and L.A. look on in absolute, morbid astonishment.
p103
aVBut it's this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo, what I'd like to ask is, if the computer is becoming a principal tool
p106
aVof media and entertainment, how did we get here?
p107
aVI mean, how did a machine that was built for accounting
p108
aVand artillery morph into media?
p109
aa(lp110
VOf course, the first computer was built just after World War II
p111
aVto solve military problems, but things got really interesting
p112
aVjust a couple of years later \u2014 1949 with Whirlwind,
p113
aVbuilt at MIT's Lincoln Lab. Jay Forrester was building this for the Navy,
p114
aVbut you can't help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind
p115
aVa machine that might actually be a potential media star.
p116
aVSo take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist
p117
aVof early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers,
p118
aVand the computer begins to express itself.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Video) Journalist: It's a Whirlwind electronic computer.
p121
aVWith considerable trepidation,
p122
aVwe undertake to interview this new machine.
p123
aa(lp124
VJay Forrester: Hello New York, this is Cambridge.
p125
aVAnd this is the oscilloscope of the Whirlwind electronic computer.
p126
aVWould you like if I used the machine?
p127
aa(lp128
VJournalist: Yes, of course. But I have an idea, Mr. Forrester.
p129
aVSince this computer was made
p130
aVin conjunction with the Office of Naval Research,
p131
aVwhy don't we switch down to the Pentagon in Washington
p132
aVand let the Navy's research chief, Admiral Bolster,
p133
aVgive Whirlwind the workout?
p134
aa(lp135
VCalvin Bolster: Well, Ed, this problem concerns the Navy's Viking rocket.
p136
aVThis rocket goes up 135 miles into the sky.
p137
aVNow, at the standard rate of fuel consumption,
p138
aVI would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocket
p139
aVand see how it can determine, at any instant,
p140
aVsay at the end of 40 seconds, the amount of fuel remaining,
p141
aVand the velocity at that set instant.
p142
aVJF: Over on the left-hand side,
p143
aVyou will notice fuel consumption decreasing as the rocket takes off.
p144
aVAnd on the right-hand side, there's a scale
p145
aVthat shows the rocket's velocity.
p146
aVThe rocket's position is shown by the trajectory
p147
aVthat we're now looking at.
p148
aVAnd as it reaches the peak of its trajectory,
p149
aVthe velocity, you will notice, has dropped off to a minimum.
p150
aVThen, as the rocket dives down, velocity picks up again
p151
aVtoward a maximum velocity and the rocket hits the ground.
p152
aa(lp153
VHow's that?
p154
aVJournalist: What about that, Admiral?
p155
aVCB: Looks very good to me.
p156
aa(lp157
VJF: And before leaving, we would like to show you another kind of
p158
aVmathematical problem that some of the boys have worked out
p159
aVin their spare time, in a less serious vein, for a Sunday afternoon. (Music)
p160
aa(lp161
VJournalist: Thank you very much indeed, Mr. Forrester and the MIT lab.
p162
aa(lp163
VPH: You know, so much was worked out: the first real-time interaction,
p164
aVthe video display, pointing a gun. It lead to the microcomputer,
p165
aVbut unfortunately, it was too pricey for the Navy,
p166
aVand all of this would have been lost
p167
aVif it weren't for a happy coincidence.
p168
aa(lp169
VEnter the atomic bomb.
p170
aVWe're threatened by the greatest weapon ever,
p171
aVand knowing a good thing when it sees it,
p172
aVthe Air Force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us.
p173
aVThey adapt Whirlwind to a massive air defense system,
p174
aVdeploy it all across the frozen north,
p175
aVand spend nearly three times as much on this computer
p176
aVas was spent on the Manhattan Project
p177
aVbuilding the A-Bomb in the first place.
p178
aVTalk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry.
p179
aVAnd you can imagine that the Air Force became a pretty good salesman.
p180
aVHere's their marketing video.
p181
aa(lp182
V(Video) Narrator: In a mass raid, high-speed bombers could be in on us
p183
aVbefore we could determine their tracks.
p184
aVAnd then it would be too late to act.
p185
aVWe cannot afford to take that chance.
p186
aVIt is to meet this threat that the Air Force has been developing SAGE,
p187
aVthe Semi-Automatic Ground Environment system,
p188
aVto strengthen our air defenses.
p189
aVThis new computer, built to become the nerve center of a defense network,
p190
aVis able to perform all the complex mathematical problems
p191
aVinvolved in countering a mass enemy raid.
p192
aVIt is provided with its own powerhouse
p193
aVcontaining large diesel-driven generators,
p194
aVair-conditioning equipment, and cooling towers
p195
aVrequired to cool the thousands of vacuum tubes in the computer.
p196
aa(lp197
VPH: You know, that one computer was huge.
p198
aVThere's an interesting marketing lesson from it,
p199
aVwhich is basically, when you market a product,
p200
aVyou can either say, this is going to be wonderful,
p201
aVit will make you feel better and enliven you.
p202
aVOr there's one other marketing proposition: if you don't use our product, you'll die.
p203
aVThis is a really good example of that.
p204
aa(lp205
VThis had the first pointing device. It was distributed,
p206
aVso it worked out \u2014 distributed computing and modems \u2014
p207
aVso all these things could talk to each other.
p208
aVAbout 20 percent of all the nation's programmers were wrapped up in this thing,
p209
aVand it led to an awful lot of what we have today. It also used vacuum tubes.
p210
aVYou saw how huge it was, and to give you a sense for this \u2014
p211
aVbecause we've talked a lot about Moore's law and making things small
p212
aVat this conference, so let's talk about making things large.
p213
aVIf we took Whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know,
p214
aVsay, Century City, it would fit beautifully.
p215
aVYou'd kind of have to take Century City out, but it could fit in there.
p216
aa(lp217
VBut like, let's imagine we took the latest Pentium processor,
p218
aVthe latest Core 2 Extreme, which is a four-core processor
p219
aVthat Intel's working on, it will be our laptop tomorrow.
p220
aVTo build that, what we'd do with Whirlwind technology is
p221
aVwe'd have to take up roughly from the 10 to Mulholland,
p222
aVand from the 405 to La Cienega just with those Whirlwinds.
p223
aVAnd then, the 92 nuclear power plants
p224
aVthat it would take to provide the power
p225
aVwould fill up the rest of Los Angeles.
p226
aVThat's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of France creates.
p227
aVSo, the next time they tell you they're on to something, clearly they're not.
p228
aVSo \u2014 and we haven't even worked out the cooling needs.
p229
aVBut it gives you the kind of power that people have, that the audience has,
p230
aVand the reasons these transformations are happening.
p231
aa(lp232
VAll of this stuff starts moving into industry.
p233
aVDEC kind of reduces all this and makes the first mini-computer.
p234
aVIt shows up at places like MIT, and then a mutation happens.
p235
aVSpacewar! is built, the first computer game, and all of a sudden,
p236
aVinteractivity and involvement and passion is worked out.
p237
aVActually, many MIT students stayed up all night long working on this thing,
p238
aVand many of the principles of gaming today were worked out.
p239
aVDEC knew a good thing about wasting time.
p240
aVIt shipped every one of its computers with that game.
p241
aa(lp242
VMeanwhile, as all of this is happening, by the mid-'50s,
p243
aVthe business model of traditional broadcasting and cinema
p244
aVhas been busted completely.
p245
aVA new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls
p246
aVand they're quite certain that television is about to do them in.
p247
aVIn fact, despair is in the air.
p248
aVAnd a quote that sounds largely reminiscent
p249
aVfrom everything I've been reading all week.
p250
aVRCA had David Sarnoff, who basically commercialized radio,
p251
aVsaid this, "I don't say that radio networks must die.
p252
aVEvery effort has been made and will continue to be made
p253
aVto find a new pattern, new selling arrangements
p254
aVand new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues.
p255
aVIt may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio,
p256
aVbut I don't know how."
p257
aVAnd of course, as the computer industry develops interactively,
p258
aVproducers in the emerging TV business actually hit on the same idea.
p259
aVAnd they fake it.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Video) Jack Berry: Boys and girls, I think you all know how to get your magic windows
p262
aVup on the set, you just get them out.
p263
aVFirst of all, get your Winky Dink kits out.
p264
aVPut out your Magic Window and your erasing glove, and rub it like this.
p265
aVThat's the way we get some of the magic into it, boys and girls.
p266
aVThen take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set,
p267
aVand rub it out from the center to the corners, like this.
p268
aVMake sure you keep your magic crayons handy, your Winky Dink crayons
p269
aVand your erasing glove,
p270
aVbecause you'll be using them during the show to draw like that.
p271
aVYou all set? OK, let's get right to the first story about Dusty Man.
p272
aVCome on into the secret lab.
p273
aa(lp274
VPH: It was the dawn of interactive TV, and you may have noticed
p275
aVthey wanted to sell you the Winky Dink kits.
p276
aVThose are the Winky Dink crayons. I know what you're saying.
p277
aV"Pete, I could use any ordinary open-source crayon,
p278
aVwhy do I have to buy theirs?"
p279
aVI assure you, that's not the case.
p280
aVTurns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons
p281
aVyou should ever use with your Winky Dink Magic Window,
p282
aVother crayons may discolor or hurt the window.
p283
aVThis proprietary principle of vendor lock-in
p284
aVwould go on to be perfected with great success
p285
aVas one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere.
p286
aVIt led to lawsuits \u2014
p287
aa(lp288
V(Laughter) \u2014
p289
aa(lp290
Vfederal investigations, and lots of repercussions,
p291
aVand that's a scandal we won't discuss today.
p292
aa(lp293
VBut we will discuss this scandal, because this man, Jack Berry, the host of "Winky Dink,"
p294
aVwent on to become the host of "Twenty One," one of the most important quiz shows ever.
p295
aVAnd it was rigged, and it became unraveled when this man,
p296
aVCharles van Doren, was outed after an unnatural winning streak,
p297
aVending Berry's career.
p298
aVAnd actually, ending the career of a lot of people at CBS.
p299
aVIt turns out there was a lot to learn
p300
aVabout how this new medium worked.
p301
aa(lp302
VAnd 50 years ago, if you'd been at a meeting like this
p303
aVand were trying to understand the media,
p304
aVthere was one prophet and only but one you wanted to hear from,
p305
aVProfessor Marshall McLuhan.
p306
aVHe actually understood something about a theme
p307
aVthat we've been discussing all week. It's the role of the audience
p308
aVin an era of pervasive electronic communications.
p309
aVHere he is talking from the 1960s.
p310
aa(lp311
V(Video) Marshall McLuhan: If the audience can become involved in the actual process
p312
aVof making the ad, then it's happy. It's like the old quiz shows.
p313
aVThey were great TV because it gave the audience a role, something to do.
p314
aVThey were horrified when they discovered
p315
aVthey'd really been left out all the time because the shows were rigged.
p316
aVNow, then, this was a horrible misunderstanding of TV
p317
aVon the part of the programmers.
p318
aa(lp319
VPH: You know, McLuhan talked about the global village.
p320
aVIf you substitute the word blogosphere, of the Internet today,
p321
aVit is very true that his understanding is probably
p322
aVvery enlightening now. Let's listen in to him.
p323
aa(lp324
V(Video) MM: The global village is a world
p325
aVin which you don't necessarily have harmony.
p326
aVYou have extreme concern with everybody else's business
p327
aVand much involvement in everybody else's life.
p328
aVIt's a sort of Ann Landers' column writ large.
p329
aVAnd it doesn't necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet,
p330
aVbut it does mean huge involvement in everybody else's affairs.
p331
aVAnd so the global village is as big as a planet,
p332
aVand as small as a village post office.
p333
aa(lp334
VPH: We'll talk a little bit more about him later.
p335
aVWe're now right into the 1960s.
p336
aVIt's the era of big business and data centers for computing.
p337
aVBut all that was about to change.
p338
aVYou know, the expression of technology
p339
aVreflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in.
p340
aVAnd when I say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations,
p341
aVit's not just a joke about messianism, it's actually what we do.
p342
aVBut for this part of the story, I'd actually like to throw it
p343
aVto America's leading technology correspondent, John Markoff.
p344
aa(lp345
V(Video) John Markoff: Do you want to know what the counterculture
p346
aVin drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll and the anti-war movement
p347
aVhad to do with computing? Everything.
p348
aVIt all happened within five miles of where I'm standing,
p349
aVat Stanford University, between 1960 and 1975.
p350
aVIn the midst of revolution in the streets
p351
aVand rock and roll concerts in the parks,
p352
aVa group of researchers led by people like John McCarthy,
p353
aVa computer scientist at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab,
p354
aVand Doug Engelbart, a computer scientist at SRI, changed the world.
p355
aVEngelbart came out of a pretty dry engineering culture,
p356
aVbut while he was beginning to do his work,
p357
aVall of this stuff was bubbling on the mid-peninsula.
p358
aVThere was LSD leaking out of Kesey's Veterans' Hospital experiments
p359
aVand other areas around the campus,
p360
aVand there was music literally in the streets.
p361
aVThe Grateful Dead was playing in the pizza parlors.
p362
aVPeople were leaving to go back to the land.
p363
aVThere was the Vietnam War. There was black liberation.
p364
aVThere was women's liberation.
p365
aVThis was a remarkable place, at a remarkable time.
p366
aVAnd into that ferment came the microprocessor.
p367
aa(lp368
VI think it was that interaction that led to personal computing.
p369
aVThey saw these tools that were controlled by the establishment
p370
aVas ones that could actually be liberated and put to use
p371
aVby these communities that they were trying to build.
p372
aVAnd most importantly, they had this ethos of sharing information.
p373
aVI think these ideas are difficult to understand,
p374
aVbecause when you're trapped in one paradigm,
p375
aVthe next paradigm is always like a science fiction universe \u2014 it makes no sense.
p376
aVThe stories were so compelling that I decided to write a book about them.
p377
aVThe title of the book is, "What the Dormouse Said:
p378
aVHow the '60s Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry."
p379
aVThe title was taken from the lyrics
p380
aVto a Jefferson Airplane song. The lyrics go,
p381
aV"Remember what the dormouse said.
p382
aVFeed your head, feed your head, feed your head." (Music)
p383
aa(lp384
VPH: By this time, computing had kind of leapt into media territory,
p385
aVand in short order much of what we're doing today was imagined
p386
aVin Cambridge and Silicon Valley.
p387
aVHere's the Architecture Machine Group,
p388
aVthe predecessor of the Media Lab, in 1981.
p389
aVMeanwhile, in California, we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff.
p390
aVHyperCard was the first program
p391
aVto introduce the public to hyperlinks,
p392
aVwhere you could randomly hook to any kind of picture,
p393
aVor piece of text, or data across a file system,
p394
aVand we had no way of explaining it.
p395
aVThere was no metaphor. Was it a database?
p396
aVA prototyping tool? A scripted language?
p397
aVHeck, it was everything. So we ended up writing a marketing brochure.
p398
aa(lp399
VWe asked a question about how the mind works,
p400
aVand we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant.
p401
aVA few years later, we then hit on the idea
p402
aVof explaining to people the secret of, how do you get the content you want,
p403
aVthe way you want it and the easy way?
p404
aVHere's the Apple marketing video.
p405
aa(lp406
V(Video) James Burke: You'll be pleased to know, I'm sure, that there are several ways
p407
aVto create a HyperCard interactive video.
p408
aVThe most involved method is to go ahead
p409
aVand produce your own videodisc
p410

p411
aVBy far the simplest method is to buy a pre-made videodisc

aVThe method we illustrate in this video

aVNow, as long as we confine this to the education market,
p424
aVand a personal matter between the computer and the file system,
p425
aVthat's fine, but as you can see, it was about to leap out and upset Jack Valenti
p426
aVand a lot of other people.
p427
aa(lp428
VBy the way, speaking of the filing system, it never occurred to us
p429
aVthat these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network.
p430
aVA few years later, Tim Berners-Lee worked that out.
p431
aVIt became a killer app of links, and today, of course,
p432
aVwe call that the World Wide Web.
p433
aVNow, not only was I instrumental in helping Apple miss the Internet,
p434
aVbut a couple of years later, I helped Bill Gates do the same thing.

aVand he was working on a book and I was working on a video

p438
aVWe were plenty aware that we were messing with media,
p439
aVand on the surface, it looks like we predicted a lot of the right things,
p440
aVbut we also missed an awful lot. Let's take a look.

V(Video) Narrator: The pyramids, the Colosseum, the New York subway system
p443
aVand TV dinners, ancient and modern wonders of the man-made world all.
p444
aVYet each pales to insignificance with the completion
p445
aVof that magnificent accomplishment of twenty-first-century technology,
p446
aVthe Digital Superhighway.
p447
aVOnce it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians.
p448
aVThe Digital Highway arrived in America's living rooms late in the twentieth century.
p449
aVLet us recall the pioneers who made this technical marvel possible.
p450
aVThe Digital Highway would follow the rutted trail
p451
aVfirst blazed by Alexander Graham Bell.
p452
aVThough some were incredulous ... Man 1: The phone company!

aVDavid Sarnoff commercializes radio.
p456
aVMan 2: Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand.
p457
aVNarrator: The medium introduced America to new products.
p458
aVVoice 1: Say, mom, Windows for Radio means more enjoyment
p459
aVand greater ease of use for the whole family.
p460
aVBe sure to enjoy Windows for Radio at home and at work.
p461
aVNarrator: In 1939, the Radio Corporation of America introduced television.
p462
aVMan 2: Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand.
p463
aa(lp464
VNarrator: Eventually, the race to the future took on added momentum
p465
aVwith the breakup of the telephone company.
p466
aVAnd further stimulus came
p467
aVwith the deregulation of the cable television industry,
p468
aVand the re-regulation of the cable television industry.
p469
aVTed Turner: We did the work to build this, this cable industry,
p470
aVnow the broadcasters want some of our money. I mean, it's ridiculous.
p471
aVNarrator: Computers, once the unwieldy tools of accountants and other geeks,
p472
aVescaped the backrooms to enter the media fracas.
p473
aVThe world and all its culture reduced to bits,
p474
aVthe lingua franca of all media.
p475
aVAnd the forces of convergence exploded.
p476
aa(lp477
VFinally, four great industrial sectors combined.
p478

aVMan 3: We'll see channels for the gourmet

aVAt stake: the battle for you, the consumer,
p485
aVand the right to spend billions to send a lot of information into the parlors of America. (Music)
p486
aa(lp487
VPH: We missed a lot. You know, you missed, we missed the Internet,
p488
aVthe long tail, the role of the audience, open systems, social networks.
p489
aVIt just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media.
p490
aVThomas Edison had the same problem.
p491
aVHe wrote a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it,
p492
aVand kind of only one of his ideas
p493
aVturned out to have been the right early idea.
p494
aVWell, you know where we're going on from here.
p495
aVWe come into the era of the dotcom, the World Wide Web,
p496
aVand I don't need to tell you about that
p497
aVbecause we all went through that bubble together.
p498
aVBut when we emerge from this and what we call Web 2.0,
p499
aVthings actually are quite different.
p500
aVAnd I think it's the reason that TV's so challenged.
p501
aVIf Internet one was about pages, now it's about people.
p502
aVIt's a customer, it's an audience, it's a person who's participating.
p503
aVIt's the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now.
p504
aa(lp505
V(Video) MM: Because it gave the audience a role, something to do.
p506
aa(lp507
VPH: In my own company, Technorati,
p508
aVwe see something like 67,000 blog posts an hour come in.
p509
aVThat's about 2,700 fresh, connective links
p510
aVacross about 112 million blogs that are out there.
p511
aVAnd it's no wonder that as we head into the writers' strike, odd things happen.
p512
aVYou know, it reminds me of that old saw in Hollywood,
p513
aVthat a producer is anyone who knows a writer.
p514
aVI now think a network boss is anyone who has a cable modem.
p515
aVBut it's not a joke. This is a real headline.
p516
aV"Websites attract striking writers:
p517
aVoperators of sites like MyDamnChannel.com
p518
aVcould benefit from labor disputes."
p519
aVMeanwhile, you have the TV bloggers going out on strike,
p520
aVin sympathy with the television writers.
p521
aVAnd then you have TV Guide, a Fox property,
p522
aVwhich is about to sponsor the online video awards \u2014
p523
aVbut cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television,
p524
aVnot appearing to gloat.
p525
aVTo show you how schizophrenic this all is,
p526
aVhere's the head of MySpace, or Fox Interactive, a News Corp company,
p527
aVbeing asked, well, with the writers' strike,
p528
aVisn't this going to hurt News Corp and help you online?
p529
aa(lp530
V(Video) Man: But I, yeah, I think there's an opportunity. As the strike continues,
p531
aVthere's an opportunity for more people to experience
p532
aVvideo on places like MySpace TV.
p533
aa(lp534
VPH: Oh, but then he remembers he works for Rupert Murdoch.
p535
aa(lp536
V(Video) Man: Yes, well, first, you know, I'm part of News Corporation
p537
aVas part of Fox Entertainment Group.
p538
aVObviously, we hope that the strike is \u2014
p539
aVthat the issues are resolved as quickly as possible.
p540
aa(lp541
VPH: One of the great things that's going on here is
p542
aVthe globalization of content really is happening.
p543
aVHere is a clip from a video, from a piece of animation
p544
aVthat was written by a writer in Hollywood,
p545
aVanimation worked out in Israel, farmed out to Croatia and India,
p546
aVand it's now an international series.
p547
aa(lp548
V(Video) Narrator: The following takes place between the minutes of 2:15 p.m. and 2:18 p.m.,

VVoice 1: You'll have to stay here in the safe house
p552
aVuntil we get word the terrorist threat is over.
p553
aa(lp554
VVoice 2: You mean we'll have to live here, together?
p555
aVVoices 2, 3 and 4: With her?
p556
aVVoice 2: Well, there goes the neighborhood.
p557
aa(lp558
VPH: The company that created this, Aniboom, is an interesting example
p559
aVof where this is headed. Traditional TV animation costs, say,
p560
aVbetween 80,000 and 10,000 dollars a minute.
p561
aVThey're producing things for between 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute.
p562
aVAnd they're offering their creators 30 percent of the back end,
p563
aVin a much more entrepreneurial manner. So, it's a different model.
p564
aVWhat the entertainment business is struggling with,
p565
aVthe world of brands is figuring out.
p566
aa(lp567
VFor example, Nike now understands that Nike Plus is not just a device in its shoe,
p568
aVit's a network to hook its customers together.
p569
aVAnd the head of marketing at Nike says, "People are coming to our site
p570
aVan average of three times a week. We don't have to go to them."
p571
aVWhich means television advertising is down 57 percent for Nike.
p572
aVOr, as Nike's head of marketing says,
p573
aV"We're not in the business of keeping media companies alive.
p574
aVWe're in the business of connecting with consumers."
p575
aa(lp576
VAnd media companies realize the audience is important also.
p577
aVHere's a man announcing the new Market Watch from Dow Jones,
p578
aVpowered 100 percent by the user experience on the home page \u2014
p579
aVuser-generated content married up with traditional content.
p580
aVIt turns out you have a bigger audience and more interest if you hook up with them.
p581
aVOr, as Geoffrey Moore once told me,
p582
aVit's intellectual curiosity that's the trade that brands need
p583
aVin the age of the blogosphere.
p584
aVAnd I think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business.
p585
aa(lp586
VOne of my heroes is songwriter, Ally Willis,
p587
aVwho just wrote "The Color Purple" and has been an R and \u2014
p588
aVrhythm and blues writer, and this is what she said
p589
aVabout where songwriting's going.
p590
aa(lp591
VAlly Willis: Where millions of collaborators wanted the song,
p592
aVbecause to look at them strictly as spam
p593
aVis missing what this medium is about.
p594
aa(lp595
VPH: So, to wrap up, I'd love to throw it back to Marshall McLuhan,
p596
aVwho, 40 years ago, was dealing with audiences
p597
aVthat were going through just as much change,
p598
aVand I think that, today, traditional Hollywood and the writers
p599
aVare framing this perhaps in the way that it was being framed before.
p600
aVBut I don't need to tell you this, let's throw it back to him.
p601
aa(lp602
V(Video) Narrator: We are in the middle of a tremendous clash between the old and the new.
p603
aVMM: The medium does things to people
p604
aVand they are always completely unaware of this.
p605
aVThey don't really notice the new medium that is wrapping them up.
p606
aVThey think of the old medium,
p607
aVbecause the old medium is always the content of the new medium,
p608
aVas movies tend to be the content of TV,
p609
aVand as books used to be the content,
p610
aVnovels used to be the content of movies.
p611
aVAnd so every time a new medium arrives,
p612
aVthe old medium is the content, and it is highly observable,
p613
aVhighly noticeable, but the real, real roughing up and massaging
p614
aVis done by the new medium, and it is ignored.
p615
aa(lp616
VPH: I think it's a great time of enthrallment.
p617
aVThere's been more raw DNA of communications and media
p618
aVthrown out there. Content is moving from shows to particles
p619
aVthat are batted back and forth, and part of social communications,
p620
aVand I think this is going to be a time of great renaissance and opportunity.
p621
aVAnd whereas television may have gotten beat up,
p622
aVwhat's getting built is a really exciting new form of communication,
p623
aVand we kind of have the merger of the two industries
p624
aVand a new way of thinking to look at it.
p625
