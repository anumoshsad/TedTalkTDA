VThis is poo,
p4
aVand what I want to do today is share my passion
p5
aVfor poo with you,
p6
aVwhich might be quite difficult,
p7
aVbut I think what you might find more fascinating
p8
aVis the way these small animals deal with poo.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo this animal here has got a brain
p11
aVabout the size of a grain of rice, and yet it can do things
p12
aVthat you and I couldn't possibly entertain the idea of doing.
p13
aVAnd basically it's all evolved to handle its food source,
p14
aVwhich is dung.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo the question is, where do we start this story?
p17
aVAnd it seems appropriate to start at the end,
p18
aVbecause this is a waste product that comes out
p19
aVof other animals, but it still contains nutrients
p20
aVand there are sufficient nutrients in there
p21
aVfor dung beetles basically to make a living,
p22
aVand so dung beetles eat dung, and their larvae
p23
aVare also dung-feeders.
p24
aVThey are grown completely in a ball of dung.
p25
aVWithin South Africa, we've got about 800 species of dung beetles,
p26
aVin Africa we've got 2,000 species of dung beetles,
p27
aVand in the world we have about 6,000 species of dung beetles.
p28
aVSo, according to dung beetles, dung is pretty good.
p29
aa(lp30
VUnless you're prepared to get dung under your fingernails
p31
aVand root through the dung itself, you'll never see
p32
aV90 percent of the dung beetle species,
p33
aVbecause they go directly into the dung,
p34
aVstraight down below it, and then they shuttle back and forth
p35
aVbetween the dung at the soil surface
p36
aVand a nest they make underground.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo the question is, how do they deal with this material?
p39
aVAnd most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort.
p40
aVTen percent of the species actually make a ball,
p41
aVand this ball they roll away from the dung source,
p42
aVusually bury it at a remote place away from the dung source,
p43
aVand they have a very particular behavior
p44
aVby which they are able to roll their balls.
p45
aVSo this is a very proud owner of a beautiful dung ball.
p46
aVYou can see it's a male
p47
aVbecause he's got a little hair on the back of his legs there,
p48
aVand he's clearly very pleased about what he's sitting on there.
p49
aVAnd then he's about to become a victim
p50
aVof a vicious smash-and-grab. (Laughter)
p51
aVAnd this is a clear indication
p52
aVthat this is a valuable resource.
p53
aVAnd so valuable resources have to be looked after
p54
aVand guarded in a particular way, and we think
p55
aVthe reason they roll the balls away is because of this,
p56
aVbecause of the competition that is involved
p57
aVin getting hold of that dung.
p58
aVSo this dung pat was actually \u2014 well, it was a dung pat
p59
aV15 minutes before this photograph was taken,
p60
aVand we think it's the intense competition
p61
aVthat makes the beetles so well-adapted
p62
aVto rolling balls of dung.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo what you've got to imagine here is this animal here
p65
aVmoving across the African veld.
p66
aVIts head is down. It's walking backwards.
p67
aVIt's the most bizarre way to actually transport your food in any particular direction,
p68
aVand at the same time it's got to deal with the heat.
p69
aVThis is Africa. It's hot.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo what I want to share with you now
p72
aVare some of the experiments that myself and my colleagues
p73
aVhave used to investigate how dung beetles
p74
aVdeal with these problems.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo watch this beetle,
p77
aVand there's two things that I would like you to be aware of.
p78
aVThe first is how it deals with this obstacle
p79
aVthat we've put in its way. See, look, it does a little dance,
p80
aVand then it carries on in exactly the same direction
p81
aVthat it took in the first place.
p82
aVA little dance, and then heads off in a particular direction.
p83
aVSo clearly this animal knows where it's going
p84
aVand it knows where it wants to go,
p85
aVand that's a very, very important thing,
p86
aVbecause if you think about it, you're at the dung pile,
p87
aVyou've got this great big pie that you want to get away from everybody else,
p88
aVand the quickest way to do it is in a straight line.
p89
aVSo we gave them some more tasks to deal with,
p90
aVand what we did here is we turned the world
p91
aVunder their feet. And watch its response.
p92
aVSo this animal has actually had the whole world
p93
aVturned under its feet. It's turned by 90 degrees.
p94
aVBut it doesn't flinch. It knows exactly where it wants to go,
p95
aVand it heads off in that particular direction.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo our next question then was,
p98
aVhow are they doing this?
p99
aVWhat are they doing? And there was a cue that was available to us.
p100
aVIt was that every now and then they'd climb on top of the ball
p101
aVand they'd take a look at the world around them.
p102
aVAnd what do you think they could be looking at
p103
aVas they climb on top of the ball?
p104
aVWhat are the obvious cues that this animal could use
p105
aVto direct its movement? And the most obvious one
p106
aVis to look at the sky, and so we thought,
p107
aVnow what could they be looking at in the sky?
p108
aVAnd the obvious thing to look at is the sun.
p109
aVSo a classic experiment here,
p110
aVin that what we did was we moved the sun.
p111
aVWhat we're going to do now is shade the sun with a board
p112
aVand then move the sun with a mirror
p113
aVto a completely different position.
p114
aVAnd look at what the beetle does.
p115
aVIt does a little double dance,
p116
aVand then it heads back in exactly the same direction
p117
aVit went in the first place.
p118
aVWhat happens now? So clearly they're looking at the sun.
p119
aVThe sun is a very important cue in the sky for them.
p120
aa(lp121
VThe thing is the sun is not always available to you,
p122
aVbecause at sunset it disappears below the horizon.
p123
aVWhat is happening in the sky here
p124
aVis that there's a great big pattern of polarized light in the sky
p125
aVthat you and I can't see. It's the way our eyes are built.
p126
aVBut the sun is at the horizon over here
p127
aVand we know that when the sun is at the horizon,
p128
aVsay it's over on this side,
p129
aVthere is a north-south, a huge pathway across the sky
p130
aVof polarized light that we can't see
p131
aVthat the beetles can see.
p132
aVSo how do we test that? Well, that's easy.
p133
aVWhat we do is we get a great big polarization filter,
p134
aVpop the beetle underneath it, and the filter is at right angles
p135
aVto the polarization pattern of the sky.
p136
aVThe beetle comes out from underneath the filter
p137
aVand it does a right-hand turn,
p138
aVbecause it comes back under the sky
p139
aVthat it was originally orientated to
p140
aVand then reorientates itself back
p141
aVto the direction it was originally going in.
p142
aVSo obviously beetles can see polarized light.
p143
aa(lp144
VOkay, so what we've got so far is,
p145
aVwhat are beetles doing? They're rolling balls.
p146
aVHow are they doing it? Well, they're rolling them in a straight line.
p147
aVHow are they maintaining it in a particular straight line?
p148
aVWell, they're looking at celestial cues in the sky,
p149
aVsome of which you and I can't see.
p150
aa(lp151
VBut how do they pick up those celestial cues?
p152
aVThat was what was of interest to us next.
p153
aVAnd it was this particular little behavior, the dance,
p154
aVthat we thought was important, because look,
p155
aVit takes a pause every now and then,
p156
aVand then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in.
p157
aVSo what are they doing when they do this dance?
p158
aVHow far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves?
p159
aVAnd in this experiment here, what we did was we forced them
p160
aVinto a channel, and you can see he wasn't
p161
aVparticularly forced into this particular channel,
p162
aVand we gradually displaced the beetle by 180 degrees
p163
aVuntil this individual ends up going in exactly the opposite direction
p164
aVthat it wanted to go in, in the first place.
p165
aVAnd let's see what his reaction is
p166
aVas he's headed through 90 degrees here,
p167
aVand now he's going to \u2014 when he ends up down here,
p168
aVhe's going to be 180 degrees in the wrong direction.
p169
aVAnd see what his response is.
p170
aVHe does a little dance, he turns around,
p171
aVand heads back in this. He knows exactly where he's going.
p172
aVHe knows exactly what the problem is,
p173
aVand he knows exactly how to deal with it,
p174
aVand the dance is this transition behavior
p175
aVthat allows them to reorientate themselves.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo that's the dance, but after spending many years
p178
aVsitting in the African bush watching dung beetles on nice hot days,
p179
aVwe noticed that there was another behavior
p180
aVassociated with the dance behavior.
p181
aVEvery now and then, when they climb on top of the ball,
p182
aVthey wipe their face.
p183
aVAnd you see him do it again.
p184
aVNow we thought, now what could be going on here?
p185
aVClearly the ground is very hot, and when the ground is hot,
p186
aVthey dance more often, and when they do this particular dance,
p187
aVthey wipe the bottom of their face.
p188
aVAnd we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior.
p189
aVWe thought that maybe what they're doing is trying to
p190
aVget off the hot soil and also spitting onto their face
p191
aVto cool their head down.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo what we did was design a couple of arenas.
p194
aVone was hot, one was cold.
p195
aVWe shaded this one. We left that one hot.
p196
aVAnd then what we did was we filmed them with a thermal camera.
p197
aVSo what you're looking at here is a heat image
p198
aVof the system, and what you can see here emerging
p199
aVfrom the poo is a cool dung ball.
p200
aVSo the truth is, if you look at the temperature over here,
p201
aVdung is cool. (Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VSo all we're interested in here is comparing the temperature
p204
aVof the beetle against the background.
p205
aVSo the background here is around about 50 degrees centigrade.
p206
aVThe beetle itself and the ball are probably around about
p207
aV30 to 35 degrees centigrade,
p208
aVso this is a great big ball of ice cream
p209
aVthat this beetle is now transporting across the hot veld.
p210
aVIt isn't climbing. It isn't dancing, because
p211
aVits body temperature is actually relatively low.
p212
aVIt's about the same as yours and mine.
p213
aVAnd what's of interest here is that little brain is quite cool.
p214
aVBut if we contrast now what happens in a hot environment,
p215
aVlook at the temperature of the soil.
p216
aVIt's up around 55 to 60 degrees centigrade.
p217
aVWatch how often the beetle dances.
p218
aVAnd look at its front legs. They're roaringly hot.
p219
aVSo the ball leaves a little thermal shadow,
p220
aVand the beetle climbs on top of the ball
p221
aVand wipes its face, and all the time it's trying to cool itself down,
p222
aVwe think, and avoid the hot sand that it's walking across.
p223
aa(lp224
VAnd what we did then was put little boots on these legs,
p225
aVbecause this was a way to test if the legs
p226
aVwere involved in sensing the temperature of the soil.
p227
aVAnd if you look over here, with boots they climb onto the ball
p228
aVfar less often when they had no boots on.
p229
aVSo we described these as cool boots.
p230
aVIt was a dental compound that we used to make these boots.
p231
aVAnd we also cooled down the dung ball, so we were able
p232
aVto put the ball in the fridge, gave them a nice cool dung ball,
p233
aVand they climbed onto that ball far less often
p234
aVthan when they had a hot ball.
p235
aVSo this is called stilting. It's a thermal behavior
p236
aVthat you and I do if we cross the beach,
p237
aVwe jump onto a towel, somebody has this towel \u2014
p238
aV"Sorry, I've jumped onto your towel." \u2014
p239
aVand then you scuttle across onto somebody else's towel,
p240
aVand that way you don't burn your feet.
p241
aVAnd that's exactly what the beetles are doing here.
p242
aa(lp243
VHowever, there's one more story I'd like to share with you,
p244
aVand that's this particular species.
p245
aVIt's from a genus called Pachysoma.
p246
aVThere are 13 species in the genus, and they have
p247
aVa particular behavior that I think you will find interesting.
p248
aVThis is a dung beetle. Watch what he's doing.
p249
aVCan you spot the difference?
p250
aVThey don't normally go this slowly. It's in slow motion.
p251
aVbut it's walking forwards,
p252
aVand it's actually taking a pellet of dry dung with it.
p253
aVThis is a different species in the same genus
p254
aVbut exactly the same foraging behavior.
p255
aa(lp256
VThere's one more interesting aspect of this
p257
aVdung beetle's behavior that we found quite fascinating,
p258
aVand that's that it forages and provisions a nest.
p259
aVSo watch this individual here, and what he's trying to do
p260
aVis set up a nest.
p261
aVAnd he doesn't like this first position,
p262
aVbut he comes up with a second position,
p263
aVand about 50 minutes later, that nest is finished,
p264
aVand he heads off to forage and provision
p265
aVat a pile of dry dung pellets.
p266
aVAnd what I want you to notice is the outward path
p267
aVcompared to the homeward path, and compare the two.
p268
aVAnd by and large, you'll see that the homeward path
p269
aVis far more direct than the outward path.
p270
aVOn the outward path, he's always on the lookout
p271
aVfor a new blob of dung.
p272
aVOn the way home, he knows where home is,
p273
aVand he wants to go straight to it.
p274
aVThe important thing here is that this is not a one-way trip,
p275
aVas in most dung beetles. The trip here is repeated
p276
aVback and forth between a provisioning site and a nest site.
p277
aVAnd watch, you're going to see
p278
aVanother South African crime taking place right now. (Laughter)
p279
aVAnd his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo what we're looking at here
p282
aVis a behavior called path integration.
p283
aVAnd what's taking place is that the beetle
p284
aVhas got a home spot, it goes out on a convoluted path
p285
aVlooking for food, and then when it finds food,
p286
aVit heads straight home. It knows exactly where its home is.
p287
aVNow there's two ways it could be doing that,
p288
aVand we can test that by displacing the beetle
p289
aVto a new position when it's at the foraging site.
p290
aVIf it's using landmarks, it will find its home.
p291
aVIf it is using something called path integration,
p292
aVit will not find its home. It will arrive at the wrong spot,
p293
aVand what it's doing here if it's using path integration
p294
aVis it's counting its steps or measuring the distance out in this direction.
p295
aVIt knows the bearing home, and it knows it should be in that direction.
p296
aVIf you displace it, it ends up in the wrong place.
p297
aVSo let's see what happens when we put this beetle
p298
aVto the test with a similar experiment.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo here's our cunning experimenter.
p301
aVHe displaces the beetle,
p302
aVand now we have to see what is going to take place.
p303
aVWhat we've got is a burrow. That's where the forage was.
p304
aVThe forage has been displaced to a new position.
p305
aVIf he's using landmark orientation,
p306
aVhe should be able to find the burrow,
p307
aVbecause he'll be able to recognize the landmarks around it.
p308
aVIf he's using path integration,
p309
aVthen it should end up in the wrong spot over here.
p310
aa(lp311
VSo let's watch what happens
p312
aVwhen we put the beetle through the whole test.
p313
aVSo there he is there.
p314
aVHe's about to head home, and look what happens.
p315
aVShame.
p316
aVIt hasn't a clue.
p317
aVIt starts to search for its house in the right distance
p318
aVaway from the food, but it is clearly completely lost.
p319
aVSo we know now that this animal uses path integration
p320
aVto find its way around, and the callous experimenter
p321
aVleads it top left and leaves it. (Laughter)
p322
aa(lp323
VSo what we're looking at here are a group of animals
p324
aVthat use a compass, and they use the sun as a compass
p325
aVto find their way around,
p326
aVand they have some sort of system
p327
aVfor measuring that distance,
p328
aVand we know that these species here actually
p329
aVcount the steps. That's what they use as an odometer,
p330
aVa step-counting system, to find their way back home.
p331
aVWe don't know yet what dung beetles use.
p332
aa(lp333
VSo what have we learned from these animals
p334
aVwith a brain that's the size of a grain of rice?
p335
aVWell, we know that they can roll balls in a straight line
p336
aVusing celestial cues.
p337
aVWe know that the dance behavior is an orientation behavior
p338
aVand it's also a thermoregulation behavior,
p339
aVand we also know that they use a path integration system
p340
aVfor finding their way home.
p341
aVSo for a small animal dealing with a fairly revolting substance
p342
aVwe can actually learn an awful lot from these things
p343
aVdoing behaviors that you and I couldn't possibly do.
p344
aVThank you. (Applause)
