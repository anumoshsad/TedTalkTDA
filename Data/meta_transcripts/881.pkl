VChris Anderson: We're having a debate.
p4
aVThe debate is over the proposition:
p5
aV"What the world needs now
p6
aVis nuclear energy." True or false?
p7
aVAnd before we have the debate,
p8
aVI'd like to actually take a show of hands \u2014
p9
aVon balance, right now, are you for or against this?
p10
aVSo those who are "yes," raise your hand. "For."
p11
aVOkay, hands down.
p12
aVThose who are against, raise your hands.
p13
aVOkay, I'm reading that at about
p14
aV75 to 25 in favor at the start.
p15
aVWhich means we're going to take a vote at the end
p16
aVand see how that shifts, if at all.
p17
aVSo here's the format: They're going to have six minutes each,
p18
aVand then after one little, quick exchange between them,
p19
aVI want two people on each side of this debate in the audience
p20
aVto have 30 seconds
p21
aVto make one short, crisp, pungent, powerful point.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo, in favor of the proposition, possibly shockingly,
p24
aVis one of, truly, the founders of the
p25
aVenvironmental movement,
p26
aVa long-standing TEDster, the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog,
p27
aVsomeone we all know and love, Stewart Brand.
p28
aa(lp29
VStewart Brand: Whoa.
p30
aV(Applause)
p31
aVThe saying is that with climate, those who know the most
p32
aVare the most worried.
p33
aVWith nuclear, those who know the most
p34
aVare the least worried.
p35
aVA classic example is James Hansen,
p36
aVa NASA climatologist
p37
aVpushing for 350 parts per million
p38
aVcarbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
p39
aVHe came out with a wonderful book recently
p40
aVcalled "Storms of My Grandchildren."
p41
aVAnd Hansen is hard over for nuclear power,
p42
aVas are most climatologists
p43
aVwho are engaging this issue seriously.
p44
aa(lp45
VThis is the design situation:
p46
aVa planet that is facing climate change
p47
aVand is now half urban.
p48
aVLook at the client base for this.
p49
aVFive out of six of us
p50
aVlive in the developing world.
p51
aVWe are moving to cities. We are moving up in the world.
p52
aVAnd we are educating our kids,
p53
aVhaving fewer kids,
p54
aVbasically good news all around.
p55
aVBut we move to cities, toward the bright lights,
p56
aVand one of the things that is there that we want, besides jobs,
p57
aVis electricity.
p58
aVAnd if it isn't easily gotten, we'll go ahead and steal it.
p59
aVThis is one of the most desired things
p60
aVby poor people all over the world,
p61
aVin the cities and in the countryside.
p62
aVElectricity for cities, at its best,
p63
aVis what's called baseload electricity.
p64
aVThat's where it is on
p65
aVall the time.
p66
aVAnd so far there are only three major sources of that \u2014
p67
aVcoal and gas, hydro-electric,
p68
aVwhich in most places is maxed-out \u2014
p69
aVand nuclear.
p70
aVI would love to have something in the fourth place here,
p71
aVbut in terms of constant, clean,
p72
aVscalable energy,
p73
aV[solar] and wind and the other renewables
p74
aVaren't there yet because they're inconstant.
p75
aVNuclear is and has been for 40 years.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow, from an environmental standpoint,
p78
aVthe main thing you want to look at
p79
aVis what happens to the waste from nuclear and from coal,
p80
aVthe two major sources of electricity.
p81
aVIf all of your electricity in your lifetime came from nuclear,
p82
aVthe waste from that lifetime of electricity
p83
aVwould go in a Coke can \u2014
p84
aVa pretty heavy Coke can, about two pounds.
p85
aVBut one day of coal
p86
aVadds up to one hell of a lot
p87
aVof carbon dioxide
p88
aVin a normal one-gigawatt coal-fired plant.
p89
aVThen what happens to the waste?
p90
aVThe nuclear waste typically goes into
p91
aVa dry cask storage
p92
aVout back of the parking lot at the reactor site
p93
aVbecause most places don't have underground storage yet.
p94
aVIt's just as well, because it can stay where it is.
p95
aVWhile the carbon dioxide,
p96
aVvast quantities of it, gigatons,
p97
aVgoes into the atmosphere
p98
aVwhere we can't get it back \u2014 yet \u2014
p99
aVand where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about.
p100
aVSo when you add up the greenhouse gases
p101
aVin the lifetime of these various energy sources,
p102
aVnuclear is down there with wind and hydro,
p103
aVbelow solar and way below, obviously, all the fossil fuels.
p104
aa(lp105
VWind is wonderful; I love wind.
p106
aVI love being around these
p107
aVbig wind generators.
p108
aVBut one of the things we're discovering is that
p109
aVwind, like solar, is an actually relatively
p110
aVdilute source of energy.
p111
aVAnd so it takes a very large footprint on the land,
p112
aVa very large footprint in terms of materials,
p113
aVfive to 10 times what you'd use for nuclear,
p114
aVand typically to get one gigawatt of electricity
p115
aVis on the order of 250 square miles
p116
aVof wind farm.
p117
aVIn places like Denmark and Germany,
p118
aVthey've maxed out on wind already.
p119
aVThey've run out of good sites.
p120
aVThe power lines are getting overloaded.
p121
aVAnd you peak out.
p122
aVLikewise, with solar,
p123
aVespecially here in California,
p124
aVwe're discovering that the 80 solar farm
p125
aVschemes that are going forward
p126
aVwant to basically bulldoze
p127
aV1,000 square miles of southern California desert.
p128
aVWell, as an environmentalist, we would rather that didn't happen.
p129
aVIt's okay on frapped-out agricultural land.
p130
aVSolar's wonderful on rooftops.
p131
aVBut out in the landscape,
p132
aVone gigawatt is on the order of 50 square miles
p133
aVof bulldozed desert.
p134
aa(lp135
VWhen you add all these things up \u2014
p136
aVSaul Griffith did the numbers and figured out
p137
aVwhat would it take
p138
aVto get 13 clean
p139
aVterawatts of energy
p140
aVfrom wind, solar and biofuels,
p141
aVand that area would be roughly the size of the United States,
p142
aVan area he refers to as "Renewistan."
p143
aVA guy who's added it up all this very well is David Mackay,
p144
aVa physicist in England,
p145
aVand in his wonderful book, "Sustainable Energy," among other things,
p146
aVhe says, "I'm not trying to be pro-nuclear. I'm just pro-arithmetic."
p147
aa(lp148
V(Laughter)
p149
aa(lp150
VIn terms of weapons,
p151
aVthe best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy.
p152
aVWe have been taking down
p153
aVthe Russian warheads,
p154
aVturning it into electricity.
p155
aVTen percent of American electricity
p156
aVcomes from decommissioned warheads.
p157
aVWe haven't even started the American stockpile.
p158
aVI think of most interest to a TED audience
p159
aVwould be the new generation of reactors
p160
aVthat are very small,
p161
aVdown around 10
p162
aVto 125 megawatts.
p163
aVThis is one from Toshiba.
p164
aVHere's one the Russians are already building that floats on a barge.
p165
aVAnd that would be very interesting in the developing world.
p166
aVTypically, these things are put in the ground.
p167
aVThey're referred to as nuclear batteries.
p168
aVThey're incredibly safe,
p169
aVweapons proliferation-proof and all the rest of it.
p170
aVHere is a commercial version from New Mexico
p171
aVcalled the Hyperion,
p172
aVand another one from Oregon called NuScale.
p173
aVBabcock & Wilcox that make nuclear reactors,
p174
aVhere's an integral fast reactor.
p175
aVThorium reactor that Nathan Myhrvold's involved in.
p176
aVThe governments of the world are going to have to decide
p177
aVthat coals need to be made expensive, and these will go ahead.
p178
aVAnd here's the future.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Applause)
p181
aa(lp182
VCA: Okay. Okay.
p183
aV(Applause)
p184
aVSo arguing against,
p185
aVa man who's been at the nitty, gritty heart
p186
aVof the energy debate and the climate change debate for years.
p187
aVIn 2000, he discovered that soot
p188
aVwas probably the second leading cause of global warming, after CO2.
p189
aVHis team have been making detailed calculations
p190
aVof the relative impacts
p191
aVof different energy sources.
p192
aVHis first time at TED, possibly a disadvantage \u2014 we shall see \u2014
p193
aVfrom Stanford,
p194
aVProfessor Mark Jacobson. Good luck.
p195
aa(lp196
VMark Jacobson: Thank you.
p197
aV(Applause)
p198
aVSo my premise here is that nuclear energy
p199
aVputs out more carbon dioxide,
p200
aVputs out more air pollutants,
p201
aVenhances mortality more and takes longer to put up
p202
aVthan real renewable energy systems,
p203
aVnamely wind, solar,
p204
aVgeothermal power, hydro-tidal wave power.
p205
aVAnd it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation.
p206
aVSo let's start just by looking at the
p207
aVCO2 emissions from the life cycle.
p208
aVCO2e emissions are equivalent emissions
p209
aVof all the greenhouse gases and particles
p210
aVthat cause warming
p211
aVand converted to CO2.
p212
aVAnd if you look, wind and concentrated solar
p213
aVhave the lowest CO2 emissions, if you look at the graph.
p214
aVNuclear \u2014 there are two bars here.
p215
aVOne is a low estimate, and one is a high estimate.
p216
aVThe low estimate is the nuclear energy industry
p217
aVestimate of nuclear.
p218
aVThe high is the average of 103
p219
aVscientific, peer-reviewed studies.
p220
aVAnd this is just the
p221
aVCO2 from the life cycle.
p222
aa(lp223
VIf we look at the delays,
p224
aVit takes between 10 and 19 years
p225
aVto put up a nuclear power plant
p226
aVfrom planning to operation.
p227
aVThis includes about three and a half to six years
p228
aVfor a site permit.
p229
aVand another two and a half to four years
p230
aVfor a construction permit and issue,
p231
aVand then four to nine years for actual construction.
p232
aVAnd in China, right now,
p233
aVthey're putting up five gigawatts of nuclear.
p234
aVAnd the average, just for the construction time of these,
p235
aVis 7.1 years
p236
aVon top of any planning times.
p237
aVWhile you're waiting around for your nuclear,
p238
aVyou have to run the regular electric power grid,
p239
aVwhich is mostly coal in the United States and around the world.
p240
aVAnd the chart here shows the difference between
p241
aVthe emissions from the regular grid,
p242
aVresulting if you use nuclear, or anything else,
p243
aVversus wind, CSP or photovoltaics.
p244
aVWind takes about two to five years on average,
p245
aVsame as concentrated solar and photovoltaics.
p246
aVSo the difference is the opportunity cost
p247
aVof using nuclear versus wind, or something else.
p248
aVSo if you add these two together, alone,
p249
aVyou can see a separation
p250
aVthat nuclear puts out at least nine to 17 times
p251
aVmore CO2 equivalent emissions than wind energy.
p252
aVAnd this doesn't even account
p253
aVfor the footprint on the ground.
p254
aa(lp255
VIf you look at the air pollution health effects,
p256
aVthis is the number of deaths per year in 2020
p257
aVjust from vehicle exhaust.
p258
aVLet's say we converted all the vehicles in the United States
p259
aVto battery electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles
p260
aVor flex fuel vehicles run on E85.
p261
aVWell, right now in the United States,
p262
aV50 to 100,000 people die per year from air pollution,
p263
aVand vehicles are about 25,000 of those.
p264
aVIn 2020, the number will go down to 15,000
p265
aVdue to improvements.
p266
aVAnd so, on the right, you see gasoline emissions,
p267
aVthe death rates of 2020.
p268
aVIf you go to corn or cellulosic ethanol,
p269
aVyou'd actually increase the death rate slightly.
p270
aVIf you go to nuclear,
p271
aVyou do get a big reduction,
p272
aVbut it's not as much as with wind and concentrated solar.
p273
aa(lp274
VNow if you consider the fact
p275
aVthat nuclear weapons proliferation
p276
aVis associated with nuclear energy proliferation,
p277
aVbecause we know for example,
p278
aVIndia and Pakistan developed nuclear weapons secretly
p279
aVby enriching uranium
p280
aVin nuclear energy facilities.
p281
aVNorth Korea did that to some extent.
p282
aVIran is doing that right now.
p283
aVAnd Venezuela would be doing it
p284
aVif they started with their nuclear energy facilities.
p285
aVIf you do a large scale expansion
p286
aVof nuclear energy across the world,
p287
aVand as a result there was just one
p288
aVnuclear bomb created
p289
aVthat was used to destroy a city
p290
aVsuch as Mumbai or some other big city, megacity,
p291
aVthe additional death rates due to this
p292
aVaveraged over 30 years and then scaled to the population of the U.S.
p293
aVwould be this.
p294
aVSo, do we need this?
p295
aa(lp296
VThe next thing is: What about the footprint? Stewart mentioned the footprint.
p297
aVActually, the footprint on the ground for wind
p298
aVis by far the smallest of any energy source in the world.
p299
aVThat, because the footprint, as you can see,
p300
aVis just the pole touching the ground.
p301
aVAnd you can power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet
p302
aVwith 73,000 to 145,000
p303
aVfive-megawatt wind turbines.
p304
aVThat would take between one and three square kilometers
p305
aVof footprint on the ground, entirely.
p306
aVThe spacing is something else.
p307
aVThat's the footprint that is always being confused.
p308
aVPeople confuse footprint with spacing.
p309
aVAs you can see from these pictures,
p310
aVthe spacing between can be used for multiple purposes
p311
aVincluding agricultural land,
p312
aVrange land or open space.
p313
aVOver the ocean, it's not even land.
p314
aVNow if we look at nuclear \u2014 (Laughter)
p315
aVWith nuclear, what do we have?
p316
aVWe have facilities around there. You also have a buffer zone
p317
aVthat's 17 square kilometers.
p318
aVAnd you have the uranium mining
p319
aVthat you have to deal with.
p320
aa(lp321
VNow if we go to the area,
p322
aVlots is worse than nuclear or wind.
p323
aVFor example, cellulosic ethanol, to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet,
p324
aVthis is how much land you would need.
p325
aVThat's cellulosic, second generation
p326
aVbiofuels from prairie grass.
p327
aVHere's corn ethanol. It's smaller.
p328
aVThis is based on ranges from data,
p329
aVbut if you look at nuclear,
p330
aVit would be the size of Rhode Island to power the U.S. vehicle fleet.
p331
aVFor wind, there's a larger area,
p332
aVbut much smaller footprint.
p333
aVAnd of course, with wind,
p334
aVyou could put it all over the East Coast,
p335
aVoffshore theoretically, or you can split it up.
p336
aVAnd now, if you go back to
p337
aVlooking at geothermal, it's even smaller than both,
p338
aVand solar is slightly larger than the nuclear spacing,
p339
aVbut it's still pretty small.
p340
aVAnd this is to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet.
p341
aVTo power the entire world with 50 percent wind,
p342
aVyou would need about one percent of world land.
p343
aa(lp344
VMatching the reliability, base load is actually irrelevant.
p345
aVWe want to match the hour-by-hour power supply.
p346
aVYou can do that by combining renewables.
p347
aVThis is from real data in California,
p348
aVlooking at wind data and solar data.
p349
aVAnd it considers just using existing hydro
p350
aVto match the hour-by-hour power demand.
p351
aVHere are the world wind resources.
p352
aVThere's five to 10 times more wind available worldwide
p353
aVthan we need for all the world.
p354
aVSo then here's the final ranking.
p355
aVAnd one last slide I just want to show. This is the choice:
p356
aVYou can either have wind or nuclear.
p357
aVIf you use wind,
p358
aVyou guarantee ice will last.
p359
aVNuclear, the time lag alone
p360
aVwill allow the Arctic to melt and other places to melt more.
p361
aVAnd we can guarantee a clean, blue sky
p362
aVor an uncertain future with nuclear power.
p363
aa(lp364
V(Applause)
p365
aa(lp366
VCA: All right.
p367
aVSo while they're having their comebacks on each other \u2014
p368
aVand yours is slightly short because you slightly overran \u2014
p369
aVI need two people from either side.
p370
aVSo if you're for this,
p371
aVif you're for nuclear power, put up two hands.
p372
aVIf you're against, put up one.
p373
aVAnd I want two of each for the mics.
p374
aVNow then, you guys have \u2014
p375
aVyou have a minute comeback on him
p376
aVto pick up a point he said, challenge it,
p377
aVwhatever.
p378
aa(lp379
VSB: I think a point of difference we're having, Mark,
p380
aVhas to do with weapons
p381
aVand energy.
p382
aVThese diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow
p383
aVputting out a lot of greenhouse gases \u2014
p384
aVa lot of those studies include, "Well of course war will be inevitable
p385
aVand therefore we'll have cities burning and stuff like that,"
p386
aVwhich is kind of finessing it
p387
aVa little bit, I think.
p388
aVThe reality is that there's, what,
p389
aV21 nations that have nuclear power?
p390
aVOf those, seven have nuclear weapons.
p391
aVIn every case, they got the weapons
p392
aVbefore they got the nuclear power.
p393
aVThere are two nations, North Korea and Israel,
p394
aVthat have nuclear weapons
p395
aVand don't have nuclear power at all.
p396
aVThe places that we would most like to have
p397
aVreally clean energy occur
p398
aVare China, India, Europe, North America,
p399
aVall of which have sorted out their situation
p400
aVin relation to nuclear weapons.
p401
aVSo that leaves a couple of places like Iran,
p402
aVmaybe Venezuela,
p403
aVthat you would like to have very close
p404
aVsurveillance of anything
p405
aVthat goes on with fissile stuff.
p406
aVPushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we
p407
aVreally know where all of the fissile material is,
p408
aVand we can move toward
p409
aVzero weapons left, once we know all that.
p410
aa(lp411
VCA: Mark,
p412
aV30 seconds, either on that or on anything Stewart said.
p413
aa(lp414
VMJ: Well we know India and Pakistan had nuclear energy first,
p415
aVand then they developed nuclear weapons secretly in the factories.
p416
aVSo the other thing is, we don't need nuclear energy.
p417
aVThere's plenty of solar and wind.
p418
aVYou can make it reliable, as I showed with that diagram.
p419
aVThat's from real data.
p420
aVAnd this is an ongoing research. This is not rocket science.
p421
aVSolving the world's problems can be done,
p422
aVif you really put your mind to it and use clean, renewable energy.
p423
aVThere's absolutely no need for nuclear power.
p424
aa(lp425
V(Applause)
p426
aa(lp427
VCA: We need someone for.
p428
aVRod Beckstrom: Thank you Chris. I'm Rod Beckstrom, CEO of ICANN.
p429
aVI've been involved in global warming policy
p430
aVsince 1994,
p431
aVwhen I joined the board of Environmental Defense Fund
p432
aVthat was one of the crafters of the Kyoto Protocol.
p433
aVAnd I want to support Stewart Brand's position.
p434
aVI've come around in the last 10 years.
p435
aVI used to be against nuclear power.
p436
aVI'm now supporting Stewart's position,
p437
aVsoftly, from a risk-management standpoint,
p438
aVagreeing that
p439
aVthe risks of overheating the planet
p440
aVoutweigh the risk of nuclear incident,
p441
aVwhich certainly is possible and is a very real problem.
p442
aVHowever, I think there may be a win-win solution here
p443
aVwhere both parties can win this debate,
p444
aVand that is, we face a situation
p445
aVwhere it's carbon caps on this planet
p446
aVor die.
p447
aVAnd in the United States Senate,
p448
aVwe need bipartisan support \u2014
p449
aVonly one or two votes are needed \u2014
p450
aVto move global warming through the Senate,
p451
aVand this room can help.
p452
aVSo if we get that through, then Mark will solve these problems. Thanks Chris.
p453
aa(lp454
VCA: Thank you Rod Beckstrom. Against.
p455
aa(lp456
VDavid Fanton: Hi, I'm David Fanton. I just want to say a couple quick things.
p457
aVThe first is: be aware of the propaganda.
p458
aVThe propaganda from the industry
p459
aVhas been very, very strong.
p460
aVAnd we have not had
p461
aVthe other side of the argument fully aired
p462
aVso that people can draw their own conclusions.
p463
aVBe very aware of the propaganda.
p464
aVSecondly, think about this.
p465
aVIf we build all these nuclear power plants,
p466
aVall that waste
p467
aVis going to be on hundreds, if not thousands,
p468
aVof trucks and trains,
p469
aVmoving through this country every day.
p470
aVTell me they're not going to have accidents.
p471
aVTell me that those accidents aren't going to
p472
aVput material into the environment
p473
aVthat is poisonous for hundreds of thousands of years.
p474
aVAnd then tell me that each and every one of those trucks and trains
p475
aVisn't a potential terrorist target.
p476
aa(lp477
VCA: Thank you.
p478
aVFor.
p479

VAlex: Hi, I'm Alex. I just wanted to say,
p482
aVI'm, first of all, renewable energy's biggest fan.
p483
aVI've got solar PV on my roof.
p484
aVI've got a hydro conversion
p485
aVat a watermill that I own.
p486
aVAnd I'm, you know, very much "pro" that kind of stuff.
p487
aVHowever, there's a basic arithmetic problem here.
p488
aVThe capability of
p489
aVthe sun shining, the wind blowing and the rain falling,
p490
aVsimply isn't enough to add up.
p491
aVSo if we want to keep the lights on,
p492
aVwe actually need a solution
p493
aVwhich is going to keep generating all of the time.
p494
aVI campaigned against nuclear weapons in the '80s,
p495
aVand I continue to do so now.
p496
aVBut we've got an opportunity
p497
aVto recycle them into something more useful
p498
aVthat enables us to get energy all of the time.
p499
aVAnd, ultimately, the arithmetic problem isn't going to go away.
p500
aVWe're not going to get enough energy from renewables alone.
p501
aVWe need a solution that generates all of the time.
p502
aVIf we're going to keep the lights on,
p503
aVnuclear is that solution.
p504
aa(lp505
VCA: Thank you.
p506
aVAnyone else against?
p507
aa(lp508
VMan: The last person who was in favor made the premise
p509
aVthat we don't have enough
p510
aValternative renewable resources.
p511
aVAnd our "against" proponent up here
p512
aVmade it very clear that we actually do.
p513
aVAnd so the fallacy
p514
aVthat we need this resource
p515
aVand we can actually make it in a time frame
p516
aVthat is meaningful is not possible.
p517
aVI will also add one other thing.
p518
aVRay Kurzweil and all the other talks \u2014
p519
aVwe know that the stick is going up exponentially.
p520
aVSo you can't look at state-of-the-art technologies in renewables
p521
aVand say, "That's all we have."
p522
aVBecause five years from now, it will blow you away
p523
aVwhat we'll actually have as alternatives
p524
aVto this horrible, disastrous nuclear power.
p525
aa(lp526
VCA: Point well made. Thank you.
p527
aa(lp528
V(Applause)
p529
aa(lp530
VSo each of you has really just a couple sentences \u2014
p531
aV30 seconds each
p532
aVto sum up.
p533
aVYour final pitch, Stewart.
p534
aa(lp535
VSB: I loved your "It all balances out" chart
p536
aVthat you had there.
p537
aVIt was a sunny day and a windy night.
p538
aVAnd just now in England
p539
aVthey had a cold spell.
p540
aVAll of the wind in the entire country
p541
aVshut down for a week.
p542
aVNone of those things were stirring.
p543
aVAnd as usual, they had to buy nuclear power from France.
p544
aVTwo gigawatts comes through the Chunnel.
p545
aVThis keeps happening.
p546
aVI used to worry about the 10,000 year factor.
p547
aVAnd the fact is, we're going to use the nuclear waste we have for fuel
p548
aVin the fourth generation of reactors that are coming along.
p549
aVAnd especially the small reactors need to go forward.
p550
aVI heard from Nathan Myhrvold \u2014 and I think here's the action point \u2014
p551
aVit'll take an act of Congress
p552
aVto make the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
p553
aVstart moving quickly on these small reactors,
p554
aVwhich we need very much, here and in the world.
p555

VMJ: So we've analyzed the hour-by-hour
p559
aVpower demand and supply,
p560
aVlooking at solar, wind, using data for California.
p561
aVAnd you can match that demand, hour-by-hour,
p562
aVfor the whole year almost.
p563
aVNow, with regard to the resources,
p564
aVwe've developed the first wind map of the world,
p565
aVfrom data alone, at 80 meters.
p566
aVWe know what the wind resources are. You can cover 15 percent.
p567
aVFifteen percent of the entire U.S.
p568
aVhas wind at fast enough speeds to be cost-competitive.
p569
aVAnd there's much more solar than there is wind.
p570
aVThere's plenty of resource. You can make it reliable.
p571
aa(lp572
VCA: Okay. So, thank you, Mark.
p573
aV(Applause)
p574
aVSo if you were in Palm Springs ...
p575
aV(Laughter)
p576
aV(Applause)
p577
aVShameless. Shameless. Shameless.
p578
aV(Applause)
p579
aa(lp580
VSo, people of the TED community,
p581
aVI put it to you that what the world needs now
p582
aVis nuclear energy.
p583
aVAll those in favor, raise your hands.
p584
aV(Shouts)
p585
aVAnd all those against.
p586
aVOoooh.
p587
aVNow that is \u2014 my take on that ...
p588
aVJust put up ... Hands up, people who changed their minds during the debate,
p589
aVwho voted differently.
p590
aVThose of you who changed your mind
p591
aVin favor of "for"
p592
aVput your hands up.
p593
aVOkay. So here's the read on it.
p594
aVBoth people won supporters,
p595
aVbut on my count,
p596
aVthe mood of the TED community shifted
p597
aVfrom about 75 to 25
p598
aVto about 65 to 35
p599
aVin favor, in favor.
p600
aa(lp601
VYou both won. I congratulate both of you.
p602
aVThank you for that.
