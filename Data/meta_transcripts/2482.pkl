VI'm turning 44 next month,
p4
aVand I have the sense that 44 is going to be a very good year,
p5
aVa year of fulfillment, realization.
p6
aVI have that sense,
p7
aVnot because of anything particular in store for me,
p8
aVbut because I read it would be a good year
p9
aVin a 1968 book by Norman Mailer.
p10
aa(lp11
V"He felt his own age, forty-four ..."
p12
aVwrote Mailer in "The Armies of the Night,"
p13
aV"... felt as if he were a solid embodiment
p14
aVof bone, muscle, heart, mind, and sentiment to be a man,
p15
aVas if he had arrived."
p16
aa(lp17
VYes, I know Mailer wasn't writing about me.
p18
aVBut I also know that he was;
p19
aVfor all of us \u2014 you, me, the subject of his book,
p20
aVage more or less in step,
p21
aVproceed from birth along the same great sequence:
p22
aVthrough the wonders and confinements of childhood;
p23
aVthe emancipations and frustrations of adolescence;
p24
aVthe empowerments and millstones of adulthood;
p25
aVthe recognitions and resignations of old age.
p26
aVThere are patterns to life,
p27
aVand they are shared.
p28
aVAs Thomas Mann wrote: "It will happen to me as to them."
p29
aa(lp30
VWe don't simply live these patterns.
p31
aVWe record them, too.
p32
aVWe write them down in books, where they become narratives
p33
aVthat we can then read and recognize.
p34
aVBooks tell us who we've been,
p35
aVwho we are, who we will be, too.
p36
aVSo they have for millennia.
p37
aVAs James Salter wrote,
p38
aV"Life passes into pages if it passes into anything."
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd so six years ago, a thought leapt to mind:
p41
aVif life passed into pages, there were, somewhere,
p42
aVpassages written about every age.
p43
aVIf I could find them, I could assemble them into a narrative.
p44
aVI could assemble them into a life,
p45
aVa long life, a hundred-year life,
p46
aVthe entirety of that same great sequence
p47
aVthrough which the luckiest among us pass.
p48
aVI was then 37 years old,
p49
aV"an age of discretion," wrote William Trevor.
p50
aVI was prone to meditating on time and age.
p51
aVAn illness in the family and later an injury to me
p52
aVhad long made clear that growing old could not be assumed.
p53
aVAnd besides, growing old only postponed the inevitable,
p54
aVtime seeing through what circumstance did not.
p55
aVIt was all a bit disheartening.
p56
aa(lp57
VA list, though, would last.
p58
aVTo chronicle a life year by vulnerable year
p59
aVwould be to clasp and to ground what was fleeting,
p60
aVwould be to provide myself and others a glimpse into the future,
p61
aVwhether we made it there or not.
p62
aVAnd when I then began to compile my list, I was quickly obsessed,
p63
aVsearching pages and pages for ages and ages.
p64
aVHere we were at every annual step through our first hundred years.
p65
aV"Twenty-seven ... a time of sudden revelations,"
p66
aV"sixty-two, ... of subtle diminishments."
p67
aa(lp68
VI was mindful, of course, that such insights were relative.
p69
aVFor starters, we now live longer, and so age more slowly.
p70
aVChristopher Isherwood used the phrase "the yellow leaf"
p71
aVto describe a man at 53,
p72
aVonly one century after Lord Byron used it to describe himself at 36.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VI was mindful, too, that life can swing wildly and unpredictably
p77
aVfrom one year to the next,
p78
aVand that people may experience the same age differently.
p79
aVBut even so, as the list coalesced,
p80
aVso, too, on the page, clear as the reflection in the mirror,
p81
aVdid the life that I had been living:
p82
aVfinding at 20 that "... one is less and less sure of who one is;"
p83
aVemerging at 30 from the "... wasteland of preparation into active life;"
p84
aVlearning at 40 "... to close softly the doors to rooms
p85
aV[I would] not be coming back to."
p86
aVThere I was.
p87
aa(lp88
VOf course, there we all are.
p89
aVMilton Glaser, the great graphic designer
p90
aVwhose beautiful visualizations you see here,
p91
aVand who today is 85 \u2014
p92
aVall those years "... a ripening and an apotheosis," wrote Nabokov \u2014
p93
aVnoted to me that, like art and like color,
p94
aVliterature helps us to remember what we've experienced.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd indeed, when I shared the list with my grandfather,
p97
aVhe nodded in recognition.
p98
aVHe was then 95 and soon to die,
p99
aVwhich, wrote Roberto Bolaño,
p100
aV"... is the same as never dying."
p101
aVAnd looking back, he said to me that, yes,
p102
aVProust was right that at 22, we are sure we will not die,
p103
aVjust as a thanatologist named Edwin Shneidman was right
p104
aVthat at 90, we are sure we will.
p105
aVIt had happened to him,
p106
aVas to them.
p107
aa(lp108
VNow the list is done:
p109
aVa hundred years.
p110
aVAnd looking back over it,
p111
aVI know that I am not done.
p112
aVI still have my life to live,
p113
aVstill have many more pages to pass into.
p114
aVAnd mindful of Mailer,
p115
aVI await 44.
p116
aa(lp117
VThank you.
