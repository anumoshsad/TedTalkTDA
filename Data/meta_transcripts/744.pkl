VThis is actually a painting
p4
aVthat hangs at the Countway Library at Harvard Medical School.
p5
aVAnd it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted.
p6
aVIn the front, you see, actually, Joe Murray
p7
aVgetting the patient ready for the transplant,
p8
aVwhile in the back room you see Hartwell Harrison,
p9
aVthe Chief of Urology at Harvard,
p10
aVactually harvesting the kidney.
p11
aVThe kidney was indeed the first organ
p12
aVever to be transplanted to the human.
p13
aa(lp14
VThat was back in 1954,
p15
aV55 years ago.
p16
aVYet we're still dealing with a lot of the same challenges
p17
aVas many decades ago.
p18
aVCertainly many advances, many lives saved.
p19
aVBut we have a major shortage of organs.
p20
aVIn the last decade the number of patients
p21
aVwaiting for a transplant has doubled.
p22
aVWhile, at the same time, the actual number of transplants
p23
aVhas remained almost entirely flat.
p24
aVThat really has to do with our aging population.
p25
aVWe're just getting older.
p26
aVMedicine is doing a better job
p27
aVof keeping us alive.
p28
aVBut as we age, our organs tend to fail more.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo, that's a challenge,
p31
aVnot just for organs but also for tissues.
p32
aVTrying to replace pancreas,
p33
aVtrying to replace nerves that can help us with Parkinson's.
p34
aVThese are major issues.
p35
aVThis is actually a very stunning statistic.
p36
aVEvery 30 seconds
p37
aVa patient dies from diseases
p38
aVthat could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement.
p39
aVSo, what can we do about it?
p40
aVWe've talked about stem cells tonight.
p41
aVThat's a way to do it.
p42
aVBut still ways to go to get stem cells into patients,
p43
aVin terms of actual therapies for organs.
p44
aa(lp45
VWouldn't it be great if our bodies could regenerate?
p46
aVWouldn't it be great if we could actually harness the power
p47
aVof our bodies, to actually heal ourselves?
p48
aVIt's not really that foreign of a concept, actually;
p49
aVit happens on the Earth every day.
p50
aVThis is actually a picture of a salamander.
p51
aVSalamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate.
p52
aVYou see here a little video.
p53
aVThis is actually a limb injury in this salamander.
p54
aVAnd this is actually real photography,
p55
aVtimed photography, showing how that limb regenerates
p56
aVin a period of days.
p57
aVYou see the scar form.
p58
aVAnd that scar actually grows out
p59
aVa new limb.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo, salamanders can do it.
p62
aVWhy can't we? Why can't humans regenerate?
p63
aVActually, we can regenerate.
p64
aVYour body has many organs
p65
aVand every single organ in your body
p66
aVhas a cell population
p67
aVthat's ready to take over at the time of injury. It happens every day.
p68
aVAs you age, as you get older.
p69
aVYour bones regenerate every 10 years.
p70
aVYour skin regenerates every two weeks.
p71
aVSo, your body is constantly regenerating.
p72
aVThe challenge occurs when there is an injury.
p73
aVAt the time of injury or disease,
p74
aVthe body's first reaction
p75
aVis to seal itself off from the rest of the body.
p76
aVIt basically wants to fight off infection,
p77
aVand seal itself, whether it's organs inside your body,
p78
aVor your skin, the first reaction
p79
aVis for scar tissue to move in,
p80
aVto seal itself off from the outside.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo, how can we harness that power?
p83
aVOne of the ways that we do that
p84
aVis actually by using smart biomaterials.
p85
aVHow does this work? Well, on the left side here
p86
aVyou see a urethra which was injured.
p87
aVThis is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body.
p88
aVAnd you see that it is injured.
p89
aVWe basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials
p90
aVthat you can actually use as a bridge.
p91
aVIf you build that bridge, and you close off
p92
aVfrom the outside environment,
p93
aVthen you can create that bridge, and cells
p94
aVthat regenerate in your body,
p95
aVcan then cross that bridge, and take that path.
p96
aa(lp97
VThat's exactly what you see here.
p98
aVIt's actually a smart biomaterial
p99
aVthat we used, to actually treat this patient.
p100
aVThis was an injured urethra on the left side.
p101
aVWe used that biomaterial in the middle.
p102
aVAnd then, six months later on the right-hand side
p103
aVyou see this reengineered urethra.
p104
aVTurns out your body can regenerate,
p105
aVbut only for small distances.
p106
aVThe maximum efficient distance for regeneration
p107
aVis only about one centimeter.
p108
aVSo, we can use these smart biomaterials
p109
aVbut only for about one centimeter
p110
aVto bridge those gaps.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo, we do regenerate, but for limited distances.
p113
aVWhat do we do now,
p114
aVif you have injury for larger organs?
p115
aVWhat do we do when we have injuries
p116
aVfor structures which are much larger
p117
aVthan one centimeter?
p118
aVThen we can start to use cells.
p119
aVThe strategy here, is if a patient comes in to us
p120
aVwith a diseased or injured organ,
p121
aVyou can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ,
p122
aVless than half the size of a postage stamp,
p123
aVyou can then tease that tissue apart,
p124
aVand look at its basic components,
p125
aVthe patient's own cells,
p126
aVyou take those cells out,
p127
aVgrow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities,
p128
aVand then we then use scaffold materials.
p129
aa(lp130
VTo the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse,
p131
aVor your shirt, but actually
p132
aVthese materials are fairly complex
p133
aVand they are designed to degrade once inside the body.
p134
aVIt disintegrates a few months later.
p135
aVIt's acting only as a cell delivery vehicle.
p136
aVIt's bringing the cells into the body. It's allowing
p137
aVthe cells to regenerate new tissue,
p138
aVand once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd that's what we did for this piece of muscle.
p141
aVThis is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through
p142
aVthe structures to actually engineer the muscle.
p143
aVWe take the cells, we expand them,
p144
aVwe place the cells on the scaffold,
p145
aVand we then place the scaffold back into the patient.
p146
aVBut actually, before placing the scaffold into the patient,
p147
aVwe actually exercise it.
p148
aVWe want to make sure that we condition
p149
aVthis muscle, so that it knows what to do
p150
aVonce we put it into the patient.
p151
aVThat's what you're seeing here. You're seeing
p152
aVthis muscle bio-reactor
p153
aVactually exercising the muscle back and forth.
p154
aa(lp155
VOkay. These are flat structures that we see here,
p156
aVthe muscle.
p157
aVWhat about other structures?
p158
aVThis is actually an engineered blood vessel.
p159
aVVery similar to what we just did, but a little bit more complex.
p160
aVHere we take a scaffold,
p161
aVand we basically \u2014 scaffold can be like a piece of paper here.
p162
aVAnd we can then tubularize this scaffold.
p163
aVAnd what we do is we, to make a blood vessel, same strategy.
p164
aVA blood vessel is made up of two different cell types.
p165
aVWe take muscle cells, we paste,
p166
aVor coat the outside with these muscle cells,
p167
aVvery much like baking a layer cake, if you will.
p168
aa(lp169
VYou place the muscle cells on the outside.
p170
aVYou place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside.
p171
aVYou now have your fully seeded scaffold.
p172
aVYou're going to place this in an oven-like device.
p173
aVIt has the same conditions as a human body,
p174
aV37 degrees centigrade,
p175
aV95 percent oxygen.
p176
aVYou then exercise it, as what you saw on that tape.
p177
aa(lp178
VAnd on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered.
p179
aVThis is actually the artery that goes from your neck to your brain.
p180
aVAnd this is an X-ray showing you
p181
aVthe patent, functional blood vessel.
p182
aVMore complex structures
p183
aVsuch as blood vessels, urethras, which I showed you,
p184
aVthey're definitely more complex
p185
aVbecause you're introducing two different cell types.
p186
aVBut they are really acting mostly as conduits.
p187
aVYou're allowing fluid or air to go through
p188
aVat steady states.
p189
aVThey are not nearly as complex as hollow organs.
p190
aVHollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity,
p191
aVbecause you're asking these organs to act on demand.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo, the bladder is one such organ.
p194
aVSame strategy, we take a very small piece of the bladder,
p195
aVless than half the size of a postage stamp.
p196
aVWe then tease the tissue apart
p197
aVinto its two individual cell components,
p198
aVmuscle, and these bladder specialized cells.
p199
aVWe grow the cells outside the body in large quantities.
p200
aVIt takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ.
p201
aVWe then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder.
p202
aVWe coat the inside with these bladder lining cells.
p203
aVWe coat the outside with these muscle cells.
p204
aVWe place it back into this oven-like device.
p205
aVFrom the time you take that piece of tissue, six to eight weeks later
p206
aVyou can put the organ right back into the patient.
p207
aa(lp208
VThis actually shows the scaffold.
p209
aVThe material is actually being coated with the cells.
p210
aVWhen we did the first clinical trial for these patients
p211
aVwe actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient.
p212
aVWe brought patients in,
p213
aVsix to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery, did X-rays,
p214
aVand we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient's size
p215
aVpelvic cavity.
p216
aVFor the second phase of the trials
p217
aVwe just had different sizes, small, medium, large and extra-large.
p218
aV(Laughter)
p219
aVIt's true.
p220
aVAnd I'm sure everyone here wanted an extra-large. Right?
p221
aV(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VSo, bladders are definitely a little bit more complex
p224
aVthan the other structures.
p225
aVBut there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it.
p226
aVThis is actually a heart valve, which we engineered.
p227
aVAnd the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy.
p228
aVWe take the scaffold, we seed it with cells,
p229
aVand you can now see here, the valve leaflets opening and closing.
p230
aVWe exercise these prior to implantation.
p231
aVSame strategy.
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd then the most complex are the solid organs.
p234
aVFor solid organs, they're more complex
p235
aVbecause you're using a lot more cells per centimeter.
p236
aVThis is actually a simple solid organ like the ear.
p237
aVIt's now being seeded with cartilage.
p238
aVThat's the oven-like device;
p239
aVonce it's coated it gets placed there.
p240
aVAnd then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold.
p241
aa(lp242
VThis is actually digits that we're engineering.
p243
aVThese are being layered, one layer at a time,
p244
aVfirst the bone, we fill in the gaps with cartilage.
p245
aVWe then start adding the muscle on top.
p246
aVAnd you start layering these solid structures.
p247
aVAgain, fairly more complex organs,
p248
aVbut by far, the most complex solid organs
p249
aVare actually the vascularized, highly vascularized,
p250
aVa lot of blood vessel supply,
p251
aVorgans such as the heart,
p252
aVthe liver, the kidneys.
p253
aVThis is actually an example \u2014 several strategies
p254
aVto engineer solid organs.
p255
aa(lp256
VThis is actually one of the strategies. We use a printer.
p257
aVAnd instead of using ink, we use \u2014 you just saw an inkjet cartridge \u2014
p258
aVwe just use cells.
p259
aVThis is actually your typical desktop printer.
p260
aVIt's actually printing this two chamber heart,
p261
aVone layer at a time.
p262
aVYou see the heart coming out there. It takes about 40 minutes to print,
p263
aVand about four to six hours later
p264
aVyou see the muscle cells contract.
p265
aV(Applause)
p266
aVThis technology was developed by Tao Ju, who worked at our institute.
p267
aVAnd this is actually still, of course, experimental,
p268
aVnot for use in patients.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnother strategy that we have followed
p271
aVis actually to use decellularized organs.
p272
aVWe actually take donor organs,
p273
aVorgans that are discarded,
p274
aVand we then can use very mild detergents
p275
aVto take all the cell elements out of these organs.
p276
aVSo, for example on the left panel,
p277
aVtop panel, you see a liver.
p278
aVWe actually take the donor liver,
p279
aVwe use very mild detergents,
p280
aVand we, by using these mild detergents, we take all the cells
p281
aVout of the liver.
p282
aa(lp283
VTwo weeks later, we basically can lift this organ up,
p284
aVit feels like a liver,
p285
aVwe can hold it like a liver,
p286
aVit looks like a liver, but it has no cells.
p287
aVAll we are left with
p288
aVis the skeleton, if you will, of the liver,
p289
aVall made up of collagen,
p290
aVa material that's in our bodies, that will not reject.
p291
aVWe can use it from one patient to the next.
p292
aVWe then take this vascular structure
p293
aVand we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply.
p294
aa(lp295
VYou can see, actually that's a fluoroscopy.
p296
aVWe're actually injecting contrast into the organ.
p297
aVNow you can see it start. We're injecting the contrast into the organ
p298
aVinto this decellularized liver.
p299
aVAnd you can see the vascular tree that remains intact.
p300
aVWe then take the cells, the vascular cells,
p301
aVblood vessel cells, we perfuse the vascular tree
p302
aVwith the patient's own cells.
p303
aVWe perfuse the outside of the liver
p304
aVwith the patient's own liver cells.
p305
aVAnd we can then create functional livers.
p306
aVAnd that's actually what you're seeing.
p307
aVThis is still experimental. But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality
p308
aVof the liver structure, experimentally.
p309
aa(lp310
VFor the kidney,
p311
aVas I talked to you about the first painting that you saw,
p312
aVthe first slide I showed you,
p313
aV90 percent of the patients on the transplant wait list
p314
aVare waiting for a kidney, 90 percent.
p315
aVSo, another strategy we're following
p316
aVis actually to create wafers
p317
aVthat we stack together, like an accordion, if you will.
p318
aVSo, we stack these wafers together, using the kidney cells.
p319
aVAnd then you can see these miniature kidneys that we've engineered.
p320
aVThey are actually making urine.
p321
aVAgain, small structures, our challenge is how to make them larger,
p322
aVand that is something we're working on
p323
aVright now at the institute.
p324
aVOne of the things that I wanted to summarize for you then
p325
aVis what is a strategy that we're going for in regenerative medicine.
p326
aa(lp327
VIf at all possible,
p328
aVwe really would like to use smart biomaterials
p329
aVthat we can just take off the shelf
p330
aVand regenerate your organs.
p331
aVWe are limited with distances right now,
p332
aVbut our goal is actually to increase those distances over time.
p333
aVIf we cannot use smart biomaterials,
p334
aVthen we'd rather use your very own cells.
p335
aa(lp336
VWhy? Because they will not reject.
p337
aVWe can take cells from you,
p338
aVcreate the structure, put it right back into you, they will not reject.
p339
aVAnd if possible, we'd rather use the cells from your very specific organ.
p340
aVIf you present with a diseased wind pipe
p341
aVwe'd like to take cells from your windpipe.
p342
aVIf you present with a diseased pancreas
p343
aVwe'd like to take cells from that organ.
p344
aa(lp345
VWhy? Because we'd rather take those cells
p346
aVwhich already know that those are the cell types you want.
p347
aVA windpipe cell already knows it's a windpipe cell.
p348
aVWe don't need to teach it to become another cell type.
p349
aVSo, we prefer organ-specific cells.
p350
aVAnd today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body,
p351
aVexcept for several which we still need stem cells for,
p352
aVlike heart, liver, nerve and pancreas.
p353
aVAnd for those we still need stem cells.
p354
aVIf we cannot use stem cells from your body
p355
aVthen we'd like to use donor stem cells.
p356
aVAnd we prefer cells that will not reject
p357
aVand will not form tumors.
p358
aa(lp359
VAnd we're working a lot with the stem cells that we
p360
aVpublished on two years ago,
p361
aVstem cells from the amniotic fluid,
p362
aVand the placenta, which have those properties.
p363
aVSo, at this point, I do want to tell you that
p364
aVsome of the major challenges we have.
p365
aVYou know, I just showed you this presentation, everything looks so good,
p366
aVeverything works. Actually no,
p367
aVthese technologies really are not that easy.
p368
aVSome of the work you saw today
p369
aVwas performed by over 700 researchers
p370
aVat our institute across a 20-year time span.
p371
aa(lp372
VSo, these are very tough technologies.
p373
aVOnce you get the formula right you can replicate it.
p374
aVBut it takes a lot to get there.
p375
aVSo, I always like to show this cartoon.
p376
aVThis is how to stop a runaway stage.
p377
aVAnd there you see the stagecoach driver,
p378
aVand he goes, on the top panel,
p379
aVHe goes A, B, C, D, E, F.
p380
aVHe finally stops the runaway stage.
p381
aVAnd those are usually the basic scientists,
p382
aVThe bottom is usually the surgeons.
p383
aV(Laughter)
p384
aVI'm a surgeon so that's not that funny.
p385
aV(Laughter)
p386
aa(lp387
VBut actually method A is the correct approach.
p388
aVAnd what I mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies
p389
aVto the clinic,
p390
aVwe've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can
p391
aVin the laboratory before we ever
p392
aVlaunch these technologies to patients.
p393
aVAnd when we launch these technologies to patients
p394
aVwe want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question.
p395
aVAre you ready to place this in your own loved one, your own child,
p396
aVyour own family member, and then we proceed.
p397
aVBecause our main goal, of course,
p398
aVis first, to do no harm.
p399
aa(lp400
VI'm going to show you now, a very short clip,
p401
aVIt's a five second clip of a patient
p402
aVwho received one of the engineered organs.
p403
aVWe started implanting some of these structures
p404
aVover 14 years ago.
p405
aVSo, we have patients now walking around with organs,
p406
aVengineered organs, for over 10 years, as well.
p407
aVI'm going to show a clip of one young lady.
p408
aVShe had a spina bifida defect, a spinal cord abnormality.
p409
aVShe did not have a normal bladder. This is a segment from CNN.
p410
aVWe are just taking five seconds.
p411
aVThis is a segment that Sanjay Gupta actually took care of.
p412
aa(lp413
VVideo: Kaitlyn M: I'm happy. I was always afraid
p414
aVthat I was going to have like, an accident or something.
p415
aVAnd now I can just go and
p416
aVgo out with my friends,
p417
aVgo do whatever I want.
p418
aa(lp419
VAnthony Atala: See, at the end of the day, the promise of regenerative medicine
p420
aVis a single promise.
p421
aVAnd that is really very simple,
p422
aVto make our patients better.
