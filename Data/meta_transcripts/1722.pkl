VMiranda Wang: We're here to talk about accidents.
p4
aVHow do you feel about accidents?
p5
aVWhen we think about accidents,
p6
aVwe usually consider them to be harmful,
p7
aVunfortunate or even dangerous, and they certainly can be.
p8
aVBut are they always that bad?
p9
aVThe discovery that had led to penicillin, for example,
p10
aVis one of the most fortunate accidents of all time.
p11
aVWithout biologist Alexander Fleming's moldy accident,
p12
aVcaused by a neglected workstation,
p13
aVwe wouldn't be able to fight off so many bacterial infections.
p14
aVJeanny Yao: Miranda and I are here today
p15
aVbecause we'd like to share how our accidents
p16
aVhave led to discoveries.
p17
aVIn 2011, we visited the Vancouver Waste Transfer Station
p18
aVand saw an enormous pit of plastic waste.
p19
aVWe realized that when plastics get to the dump,
p20
aVit's difficult to sort them because they have similar densities,
p21
aVand when they're mixed with organic matter
p22
aVand construction debris, it's truly impossible
p23
aVto pick them out and environmentally eliminate them.
p24
aVMW: However, plastics are useful
p25
aVbecause they're durable, flexible,
p26
aVand can be easily molded into so many useful shapes.
p27
aVThe downside of this convenience
p28
aVis that there's a high cost to this.
p29
aVPlastics cause serious problems, such as
p30
aVthe destruction of ecosystems,
p31
aVthe pollution of natural resources,
p32
aVand the reduction of available land space.
p33
aVThis picture you see here is the Great Pacific Gyre.
p34
aVWhen you think about plastic pollution
p35
aVand the marine environment,
p36
aVwe think about the Great Pacific Gyre,
p37
aVwhich is supposed to be a floating island of plastic waste.
p38
aVBut that's no longer an accurate depiction
p39
aVof plastic pollution in the marine environment.
p40
aVRight now, the ocean is actually a soup of plastic debris,
p41
aVand there's nowhere you can go in the ocean
p42
aVwhere you wouldn't be able to find plastic particles.
p43
aVJY: In a plastic-dependent society,
p44
aVcutting down production is a good goal, but it's not enough.
p45
aVAnd what about the waste that's already been produced?
p46
aVPlastics take hundreds to thousands of years to biodegrade.
p47
aVSo we thought, you know what?
p48
aVInstead of waiting for that garbage to sit there and pile up,
p49
aVlet's find a way to break them down
p50
aVwith bacteria.
p51
aVSounds cool, right?
p52
aVAudience: Yeah. JY: Thank you.
p53
aVBut we had a problem.
p54
aVYou see, plastics have very complex structures
p55
aVand are difficult to biodegrade.
p56
aVAnyhow, we were curious and hopeful
p57
aVand still wanted to give it a go.
p58
aVMW: With this idea in mind, Jeanny and I read through
p59
aVsome hundreds of scientific articles on the Internet,
p60
aVand we drafted a research proposal
p61
aVin the beginning of our grade 12 year.
p62
aVWe aimed to find bacteria from our local Fraser River
p63
aVthat can degrade a harmful plasticizer called phthalates.
p64
aVPhthalates are additives used in everyday plastic products
p65
aVto increase their flexibility, durability and transparency.
p66
aVAlthough they're part of the plastic,
p67
aVthey're not covalently bonded to the plastic backbone.
p68
aVAs a result, they easily escape into our environment.
p69
aVNot only do phthalates pollute our environment,
p70
aVbut they also pollute our bodies.
p71
aVTo make the matter worse, phthalates are found in products
p72
aVto which we have a high exposure, such as babies' toys,
p73
aVbeverage containers, cosmetics, and even food wraps.
p74
aVPhthalates are horrible because
p75
aVthey're so easily taken into our bodies.
p76
aVThey can be absorbed by skin contact, ingested, and inhaled.
p77
aVJY: Every year, at least 470 million pounds of phthalates
p78
aVcontaminate our air, water and soil.
p79
aVThe Environmental Protection Agency
p80
aVeven classified this group as a top-priority pollutant
p81
aVbecause it's been shown to cause cancer and birth defects
p82
aVby acting as a hormone disruptor.
p83
aVWe read that each year, the Vancouver municipal government
p84
aVmonitors phthalate concentration levels in rivers
p85
aVto assess their safety.
p86
aVSo we figured, if there are places along our Fraser River
p87
aVthat are contaminated with phthalates,
p88
aVand if there are bacteria that are able to live in these areas,
p89
aVthen perhaps, perhaps these bacteria could have evolved
p90
aVto break down phthalates.
p91
aVMW: So we presented this good idea
p92
aVto Dr. Lindsay Eltis at the University of British Columbia,
p93
aVand surprisingly, he actually took us into his lab
p94
aVand asked his graduate students Adam and James to help us.
p95
aVLittle did we know at that time
p96
aVthat a trip to the dump and some research on the Internet
p97
aVand plucking up the courage to act upon inspiration
p98
aVwould take us on a life-changing journey
p99
aVof accidents and discoveries.
p100
aVJY: The first step in our project
p101
aVwas to collect soil samples from three different sites
p102
aValong the Fraser River.
p103
aVOut of thousands of bacteria, we wanted to find ones
p104
aVthat could break down phthalates,
p105
aVso we enriched our cultures with phthalates
p106
aVas the only carbon source.
p107
aVThis implied that, if anything grew in our cultures,
p108
aVthen they must be able to live off of phthalates.
p109
aVEverything went well from there,
p110
aVand we became amazing scientists. (Laughter)
p111
aVMW: Um... uh, Jeanny. JY: I'm just joking.
p112
aVMW: Okay. Well, it was partially my fault.
p113
aVYou see, I accidentally cracked the flask
p114
aVthat had contained our third enrichment culture,
p115
aVand as a result, we had to wipe down the incubator room
p116
aVwith bleach and ethanol twice.
p117
aVAnd this is only one of the examples of the many accidents
p118
aVthat happened during our experimentation.
p119
aVBut this mistake turned out to be rather serendipitous.
p120
aVWe noticed that the unharmed cultures
p121
aVcame from places of opposite contamination levels,
p122
aVso this mistake actually led us to think that
p123
aVperhaps we can compare
p124
aVthe different degradative potentials of bacteria
p125
aVfrom sites of opposite contamination levels.
p126
aVJY: Now that we grew the bacteria,
p127
aVwe wanted to isolate strains by streaking onto mediate plates,
p128
aVbecause we thought that would be
p129
aVless accident-prone, but we were wrong again.
p130
aVWe poked holes in our agar while streaking
p131
aVand contaminated some samples and funghi.
p132
aVAs a result, we had to streak and restreak several times.
p133
aVThen we monitored phthalate utilization
p134
aVand bacterial growth,
p135
aVand found that they shared an inverse correlation,
p136
aVso as bacterial populations increased,
p137
aVphthalate concentrations decreased.
p138
aVThis means that our bacteria were actually living off of phthalates.
p139
aVMW: So now that we found bacteria that could break down phthalates,
p140
aVwe wondered what these bacteria were.
p141
aVSo Jeanny and I took three of our most efficient strains
p142
aVand then performed gene amplification sequencing on them
p143
aVand matched our data with an online comprehensive database.
p144
aVWe were happy to see that,
p145
aValthough our three strains had been previously identified bacteria,
p146
aVtwo of them were not previously associated
p147
aVwith phthalate degradation, so this was actually a novel discovery.
p148
aVJY: To better understand how this biodegradation works,
p149
aVwe wanted to verify the catabolic pathways of our three strains.
p150
aVTo do this, we extracted enzymes from our bacteria
p151
aVand reacted with an intermediate of phthalic acid.
p152
aVMW: We monitored this experiment with spectrophotometry
p153
aVand obtained this beautiful graph.
p154
aVThis graph shows that our bacteria really do have
p155
aVa genetic pathway to biodegrade phthalates.
p156
aVOur bacteria can transform phthalates, which is a harmful toxin,
p157
aVinto end products such as carbon dioxide, water
p158
aVand alcohol.
p159
aVI know some of you in the crowd are thinking,
p160
aVwell, carbon dioxide is horrible, it's a greenhouse gas.
p161
aVBut if our bacteria did not evolve to break down phthalates,
p162
aVthey would have used some other kind of carbon source,
p163
aVand aerobic respiration would have led it
p164
aVto have end products such as carbon dioxide anyway.
p165
aVWe were also interested to see that,
p166
aValthough we've obtained greater diversity
p167
aVof bacteria biodegraders from the bird habitat site,
p168
aVwe obtained the most efficient degraders from the landfill site.
p169
aVSo this fully shows that nature evolves
p170
aVthrough natural selection.
p171
aVJY: So Miranda and I shared this research
p172
aVat the Sanofi BioGENEius Challenge competition and were recognized
p173
aVwith the greatest commercialization potential.
p174
aVAlthough we're not the first ones to find bacteria
p175
aVthat can break down phthalates,
p176
aVwe were the first ones to look into our local river
p177
aVand find a possible solution to a local problem.
p178
aVWe have not only shown that bacteria
p179
aVcan be the solution to plastic pollution, but also that
p180
aVbeing open to uncertain outcomes and taking risks
p181
aVcreate opportunities for unexpected discoveries.
p182
aVThroughout this journey, we have also discovered our passion for science,
p183
aVand are currently continuing research
p184
aVon other fossil fuel chemicals in university.
p185
aVWe hope that in the near future,
p186
aVwe'll be able to create model organisms
p187
aVthat can break down not only phthalates
p188
aVbut a wide variety of different contaminants.
p189
aVWe can apply this to wastewater treatment plants
p190
aVto clean up our rivers
p191
aVand other natural resources.
p192
aVAnd perhaps one day we'll be able to tackle
p193
aVthe problem of solid plastic waste.
p194
aVMW: I think our journey has truly transformed
p195
aVour view of microorganisms,
p196
aVand Jeanny and I have shown that
p197
aVeven mistakes can lead to discoveries.
p198
aVEinstein once said,
p199
aV"You can't solve problems by using the same kind
p200
aVof thinking you used when you created them."
p201
aVIf we're making plastic synthetically, then we think
p202
aVthe solution would be to break them down biochemically.
p203
aVThank you. JY: Thank you.
