VI'm Chetan Bhatt
p4
aVand when I give my name, I'm often asked, "Where are you from?"
p5
aVAnd I normally say London.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VBut of course, I know what they're really asking,
p10
aVso I say something like,
p11
aV"Well, my grandparents and my mum were born in India,
p12
aVmy dad and I were born in Kenya,
p13
aVand I was brought up in London.
p14
aVAnd then they've got me mapped.
p15
aV"Ah, you're a Kenyan Asian. I've worked with one of those."
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd from my name they probably assume that I'm a Hindu.
p20
aVAnd this sort of fixes me for them.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut what about the Christians
p23
aVand the Muslims and the atheists
p24
aVthat I grew up with?
p25
aVOr the socialists and the liberals,
p26
aVeven the occasional Tory?
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VIndeed, all kinds of women and men \u2014
p31
aVvegetable sellers, factory workers, cooks, car mechanics \u2014
p32
aVliving in my working class area,
p33
aVin some profoundly important way,
p34
aVthey are also a part of me
p35
aVand are here with me.
p36
aVMaybe that's why I find it hard to respond to questions about identity
p37
aVand about origin.
p38
aVAnd it's not just a sort of teenage refusal to be labeled.
p39
aVIt's about our own most identities,
p40
aVthe ones that we put our hands up to,
p41
aVthe ones that we cheer for,
p42
aVthe ones that we fight for,
p43
aVthe ones that we love or hate.
p44
aVAnd it's about how we apprehend ourselves
p45
aVas well as others.
p46
aVAnd it's about identities we just assume that we have
p47
aVwithout thinking too much about them.
p48
aa(lp49
VBut our responses to questions of identity and origin
p50
aVhave substantial social and political importance.
p51
aVWe see the wars, the rages of identity going on all around us.
p52
aVWe see violent religious, national and ethnic disputes.
p53
aVAnd often the conflict is based on old stories of identity
p54
aVand belonging
p55
aVand origins.
p56
aVAnd these identities are based on myths,
p57
aVtypically about ancient, primordial origins.
p58
aVAnd these could be about Adam and Eve
p59
aVor about the supremacy of a caste or gender
p60
aVor about the vitality of a supposed race
p61
aVor about the past glories of an empire or civilization
p62
aVor about a piece of land
p63
aVthat some imagined deity has gifted.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow, people say
p66
aVthat origin stories and identity myths make us feel secure.
p67
aVWhat's wrong with that?
p68
aVThey give us a sense of belonging.
p69
aVIdentity is your cultural clothing,
p70
aVand it can make you feel warm and fuzzy inside.
p71
aVBut does it really?
p72
aVDo we really need identity myths to feel safe?
p73
aVBecause I see religious, national, ethnic disputes
p74
aVas adding to human misery.
p75
aa(lp76
VCan I dare you
p77
aVto refuse every origin myth
p78
aVthat claims you?
p79
aVWhat if we reject every single primordial origin myth
p80
aVand develop a deeper sense of personhood,
p81
aVone responsible to humanity as a whole
p82
aVrather than to a particular tribe,
p83
aVa radically different idea of humanity
p84
aVthat exposes how origin myths mystify,
p85
aVdisguise global power,
p86
aVrapacious exploitation,
p87
aVpoverty, the worldwide oppression of women and girls,
p88
aVand of course massive, accelerating inequalities?
p89
aa(lp90
VNow, origin myths are closely linked to tradition,
p91
aVand the word tradition points to something old
p92
aVand permanent, almost natural,
p93
aVand people assume tradition is just history,
p94
aVsimply the past condensed into a nice story.
p95
aVBut let's not confuse tradition with history.
p96
aVThe two are often in severe conflict.
p97
aVOrigin stories are usually recently created fictions of ancient belonging,
p98
aVand they're absurd
p99
aVgiven the complexity of humanity
p100
aVand our vastly interconnected, even if very unequal world.
p101
aVAnd today we see claims to tradition
p102
aVthat claim to be ancient
p103
aVchanging rapidly in front of our eyes.
p104
aa(lp105
VI was brought up in the 1970s near Wembley
p106
aVwith Asian, English, Caribbean, Irish families living in our street,
p107
aVand the neo-Nazi National Front was massive then
p108
aVwith regular marches and attacks on us
p109
aVand a permanent threat
p110
aVand often a frequent reality of violence against us
p111
aVon the streets, in our homes,
p112
aVtypically by neo-Nazis and other racists.
p113
aVAnd I remember during a general election a leaflet came through our letter box
p114
aVwith a picture of the National Front candidate for our area.
p115
aVAnd the picture
p116
aVwas of our next-door neighbor.
p117
aVHe threatened to shoot me once when I played in the garden as a kid,
p118
aVand many weekends, shaven-headed National Front activists
p119
aVarrived at his house
p120
aVand emerged with scores of placards
p121
aVscreaming that they wanted us to go back home.
p122
aVBut today he's one of my mum's best mates.
p123
aVHe's a very lovely, gentle and kind man,
p124
aVand at some point in his political journey out of fascism
p125
aVhe embraced a broader idea of humanity.
p126
aa(lp127
VThere was a Hindu family that we got to know well \u2014
p128
aVand you have to understand that life in our street
p129
aVwas a little bit like the setting for an Asian soap opera.
p130
aVEveryone knew everyone else's business,
p131
aVeven if they didn't want it to be known by anyone at all.
p132
aVYou really had no choice in this matter.
p133
aVBut in this family, there was a quiet little boy
p134
aVwho went to the same school as I did,
p135
aVand after I left school, I didn't hear much more about him,
p136
aVexcept that he'd gone off to India.
p137
aVNow around 2000,
p138
aVI remember seeing this short book.
p139
aVThe book was unusual
p140
aVbecause it was written by a British supporter of Al Qaeda,
p141
aVand in it the author calls for attacks in Britain.
p142
aVThis is in 1999,
p143
aVso 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq was still in the future,
p144
aVand he helped scout New York bombing targets.
p145
aVHe taught others how to make a dirty bomb to use on the London Underground,
p146
aVand he plotted a massive bombing campaign in London's shopping areas.
p147
aVHe's a very high-risk security prisoner in the UK
p148
aVand one of the most important Al Qaeda figures to be arrested in Britain.
p149
aa(lp150
VThe author of that book
p151
aVwas the very same quiet little boy
p152
aVwho went to my school.
p153
aVSo a Hindu boy from Britain
p154
aVbecame an Al Qaeda fighter
p155
aVand a most-wanted international terrorist,
p156
aVand he rejected what people would call his Hindu or Indian or British identity,
p157
aVand he became someone else.
p158
aVHe refused to be who he was.
p159
aVHe recreated himself,
p160
aVand this kind of journey is very common
p161
aVfor young men and women
p162
aVwho become involved in Al Qaeda or Islamic State
p163
aVor other transnational armed groups.
p164
aVAl Qaeda's media spokesman is a white American
p165
aVfrom a Jewish and Catholic mixed background,
p166
aVand neither he nor the boy from my school
p167
aVwere from Muslim backgrounds.
p168
aVThere's no point in asking them where are they from.
p169
aVA more important question is where they're going.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd I would also put it to you
p172
aVthat exactly the same journey occurs for those young men and women
p173
aVwho were brought up in Muslim family backgrounds.
p174
aVMost of those who join Al Qaeda
p175
aVand other Salafi jihadi groups from Europe, Asia, North America,
p176
aVeven in many cases the Middle East
p177
aVare those who have comprehensively rejected their backgrounds
p178
aVto become, in essence, new people.
p179
aVThey spend an enormous amount of time attacking their parents' backgrounds
p180
aVas profane, impure, blasphemous,
p181
aVthe wrong type of Islam,
p182
aVand their vision instead
p183
aVis a fantastical view of cosmic apocalypse.
p184
aVIt's a born again vision.
p185
aVDiscard your past, your society, your family and friends
p186
aVsince they're all impure.
p187
aVInstead, become someone else,
p188
aVyour true self,
p189
aVyour authentic self.
p190
aVNow, this isn't about a return to the past.
p191
aVIt's about using a forgery of the past
p192
aVto envision an appalling future which begins today at year zero.
p193
aVThis is why over 80 percent of the victims of Al Qaeda and Islamic State
p194
aVare people from Muslim backgrounds.
p195
aVThe first act by Salafi jihadi groups when they take over an area
p196
aVis to destroy existing Muslim institutions
p197
aVincluding mosques, shrines, preachers, practices.
p198
aVTheir main purpose is to control and punish people internally,
p199
aVto dictate the spaces that women may go,
p200
aVtheir clothing, family relations,
p201
aVbeliefs, even the minute detail of how one prays.
p202
aVAnd you get the impression in the news
p203
aVthat they are after us in the West,
p204
aVbut they are actually mainly after people from other Muslim backgrounds.
p205
aVIn their view, no other Muslim can ever be pure enough,
p206
aVso ordinary beliefs and practices that have existed for centuries
p207
aVare attacked as impure
p208
aVby teenagers from Birmingham or London
p209
aVwho know nothing
p210
aVabout the histories that they so joyously obliterate.
p211
aa(lp212
VNow here, their claim to tradition is at war with history,
p213
aVbut they're nevertheless very certain about their purity
p214
aVand about the impurity of others.
p215
aVPurity,
p216
aVcertainty,
p217
aVthe return to authentic tradition,
p218
aVthe quest for these can lead to lethal visions
p219
aVof perfect societies and perfected people.
p220
aa(lp221
VThis is what the main Hindu fundamentalist organization in India
p222
aVlooks like today at its mass rally.
p223
aVMaybe it reminds you of the 1930s in Italy or Germany,
p224
aVand the movement's roots are indeed in fascism.
p225
aVIt was a member of the same Hindu fundamentalist movement
p226
aVwho shot dead Mahatma Gandhi.
p227
aVHindu fundamentalists today view this murderer as a national hero,
p228
aVand they want to put up statues of him throughout India.
p229
aVThey've been involved for decades
p230
aVin large-scale mass violence against minorities.
p231
aVThey ban books, art, films.
p232
aVThey attack romantic couples on Valentine's Day,
p233
aVChristians on Christmas Day.
p234
aVThey don't like others talking critically
p235
aVabout what they see as their ancient culture
p236
aVor using its images
p237
aVor caricaturing it
p238
aVor drawing cartoons about it.
p239
aVBut the people making the strongest possible claims
p240
aVabout ancient, timeless Hindu religion
p241
aVare dressed in brown shorts and white shirts
p242
aVwhile claiming, oddly,
p243
aVto be the original Aryan race,
p244
aVjust like the violent Salafi jihadis
p245
aVwho make their claims about their primordial religion
p246
aVwhile dressed in black military uniforms
p247
aVand wearing balaclavas.
p248
aa(lp249
VThese people are manufacturing pure, pristine identities of conviction
p250
aVand of certainty.
p251
aVFundamentalists see religion and culture as their sole property, a property.
p252
aVBut religions and cultures are processes.
p253
aVThey're not things. They're impermanent. They're messy. They're impure.
p254
aVLook at any religion and you'll see disputes and arguments
p255
aVgoing all the way down.
p256
aa(lp257
VAny criticism of religion in any form
p258
aVhas to therefore be
p259
aVpart of the expansive sense of humanity
p260
aVwe should aspire to.
p261
aVI respect your right to have and to express your religion
p262
aVor your culture or your opinion,
p263
aVbut I don't necessarily have to respect the content.
p264
aVI might like some of it.
p265
aVI might like how an old church looks, for example,
p266
aVbut this isn't the same thing.
p267
aVSimilarly, I have a human right
p268
aVto say something that you may find offensive,
p269
aVbut you do not have a human right not to be offended.
p270
aVIn a genuine democracy, we're constantly offended
p271
aVsince people express different views all the time.
p272
aVThey also change their views,
p273
aVso their views are impermanent.
p274
aVYou cannot fix someone's political views
p275
aVbased on their religious or national or cultural background.
p276
aa(lp277
VNow, these points about religious purity
p278
aValso apply to nationalism and to racism.
p279
aVI'm always puzzled
p280
aVto have pride in your national or ethnic identity,
p281
aVpride in the accident of birth from a warm and cozy womb,
p282
aVbelief in your superiority because of the accident of birth.
p283
aa(lp284
VThese people have very firm ideas
p285
aVabout what belongs and what doesn't belong
p286
aVinside the cozy national cultures that they imagine.
p287
aVAnd I'm going to caricature a bit here, but only a little bit.
p288
aVI want you to imagine the supporter of some Little Englander
p289
aVor British nationalist political party,
p290
aVand he's sitting at home
p291
aVand he's screaming about foreigners
p292
aVinvading his country
p293
aVwhile watching Fox News,
p294
aVan American cable channel
p295
aVowned by an Australian
p296
aVon his South Korean television set
p297
aVwhich was bought by his Spanish credit card
p298
aVwhich is paid off monthly by his high-street British bank
p299
aVwhich has its headquarters in Hong Kong.
p300
aVHe supports a British football team owned by a Russian.
p301
aVHis favorite brand of fish and chips
p302
aVis owned by a Swedish venture capitalist firm.
p303
aVThe church he sometimes goes to
p304
aVhas its creed decided in meetings in Ghana.
p305
aVHis Union Jack underpants
p306
aVwere made in India.
p307
aa(lp308
V(Laughter)
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd \u2014
p311
aa(lp312
V(Applause)
p313
aa(lp314
VThank you.
p315
aa(lp316
VAnd they're laundered regularly
p317
aVby a very nice Polish lady.
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
VThere is no pure ethnicity, national culture,
p322
aVand the ethical choices we have today
p323
aVare far wider than being forced to choose
p324
aVbetween racist right and religious right visions,
p325
aVdismal visions of culture.
p326
aa(lp327
VNow, culture isn't just about language, food, clothing and music,
p328
aVbut gender relations, ancient monuments,
p329
aVa heritage of sacred texts.
p330
aVBut culture can also be what has been decided to be culture
p331
aVby those who have a political stake
p332
aVin pounding culture into the shape of a prison.
p333
aVBig political identity claims are elite bids for power.
p334
aVThey're not answers to social or economic or political injustices.
p335
aVThey often obscure them.
p336
aVAnd what about the large number of people across the globe
p337
aVwho can't point to a monument from their past,
p338
aVwho don't possess a sacred written text,
p339
aVwho can't hark back
p340
aVto the past glories of a civilization or empire?
p341
aVAre these people less a part of humanity?
p342
aa(lp343
VWhat about you,
p344
aVnow, listening to this?
p345
aVWhat about you and your identity,
p346
aVbecause you stitch your experiences and your thoughts into a continuous person
p347
aVmoving forward in time.
p348
aVAnd this is what you are when you say,
p349
aV"I," "am," or "me."
p350
aVBut this also includes all of your hopes and dreams,
p351
aVall of the you's that could have been,
p352
aVand it includes all the other people
p353
aVand the things that are in the biography of who you are.
p354
aVThey, the others,
p355
aVare also a part of you,
p356
aVmoving forward with you.
p357
aVYour authentic self, if such a thing exists,
p358
aVis a complex, messy and uncertain self,
p359
aVand that is a very good thing.
p360
aVWhy not value those impurities and uncertainties?
p361
aVMaybe clinging to pure identities is a sign of immaturity,
p362
aVand ethnic, nationalist and religious traditions are bad for you.
p363
aVWhy not be skeptical about every primordial origin claim
p364
aVmade on your behalf?
p365
aVWhy not reject the identity myths that call on you to belong,
p366
aVthat politicians and community leaders,
p367
aVso-called community leaders,
p368
aVplace on you?
p369
aVIf we don't need origin stories and fixed identities,
p370
aVwe can challenge ourselves to think creatively
p371
aVabout each other and our future.
p372
aa(lp373
VAnd here culture always takes care of itself.
p374
aVI'm not worried about culture.
p375
aVCultures are creative, dynamic processes,
p376
aVnot imposed laws and boundaries.
p377
aa(lp378
VThis is Abu al-Walid Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Rushd,
p379
aVa very senior Muslim judge and thinker in Cordoba in the 12th century,
p380
aVand his writings were considered deeply blasphemous, heretical and evil.
p381
aVLong after he died,
p382
aVfollowers of his work were ruthlessly hunted down,
p383
aVbanished and killed over several centuries
p384
aVby the most powerful religious institution of the medieval period.
p385
aVThat institution was the Roman Catholic Church.
p386
aVWhy?
p387
aVBecause ibn Rushd said that something true in religion
p388
aVmay conflict with something
p389
aVthat your reason finds to be true on earth,
p390
aVbut the latter is still true.
p391
aVThere are two distinct worlds of truth,
p392
aVone based on our reason and evidence, and one that is divine,
p393
aVand the state, political power, social law are in the realm of reason.
p394
aVReligious life is a different realm.
p395
aVThey should be kept separated.
p396
aVSocial and political life should be governed by our reason,
p397
aVnot by religion.
p398
aVAnd you can see why the church was upset by his writings,
p399
aVas indeed were some Muslims during his lifetime,
p400
aVbecause he gives us a strong statement of secularism
p401
aVof a kind which is normal in Europe today.
p402
aa(lp403
VNow, history plays many tricks on us.
p404
aVIt undermines our fixed truths
p405
aVand what we believe to be our culture and their culture.
p406
aVIbn Rushd, someone who happens to be a Muslim,
p407
aVis considered one of the key influences
p408
aVin the introduction and spread of secularism in Europe.
p409
aa(lp410
VSo against religious, nationalist and racial purists of all kinds,
p411
aVcan you make his story a part of your own,
p412
aVnot because he happened to be a Muslim,
p413
aVnot because he happened to be an Arab,
p414
aVbut because he was a human being
p415
aVwith some very good ideas
p416
aVthat shook his world
p417
aVand ours.
p418
aa(lp419
VThank you.
