VI am a conductor,
p4
aVand I'm here today
p5
aVto talk to you about trust.
p6
aVMy job depends upon it.
p7
aVThere has to be, between me and the orchestra,
p8
aVan unshakable bond of trust,
p9
aVborn out of mutual respect,
p10
aVthrough which we can spin a musical narrative
p11
aVthat we all believe in.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow in the old days, conducting, music making,
p14
aVwas less about trust and more, frankly, about coercion.
p15
aVUp to and around about the Second World War,
p16
aVconductors were invariably dictators \u2014
p17
aVthese tyrannical figures
p18
aVwho would rehearse, not just the orchestra as a whole, but individuals within it,
p19
aVwithin an inch of their lives.
p20
aVBut I'm happy to say now that the world has moved on,
p21
aVmusic has moved on with it.
p22
aVWe now have a more democratic view and way of making music \u2014
p23
aVa two-way street.
p24
aVI, as the conductor, have to come to the rehearsal with a cast-iron sense
p25
aVof the outer architecture of that music,
p26
aVwithin which there is then immense personal freedom
p27
aVfor the members of the orchestra to shine.
p28
aa(lp29
VFor myself, of course,
p30
aVI have to completely trust my body language.
p31
aVThat's all I have at the point of sale.
p32
aVIt's silent gesture.
p33
aVI can hardly bark out instructions while we're playing.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Music)
p36
aa(lp37
VLadies and gentlemen, the Scottish Ensemble.
p38
aa(lp39
V(Applause)
p40
aa(lp41
VSo in order for all this to work,
p42
aVobviously I have got to be in a position of trust.
p43
aVI have to trust the orchestra,
p44
aVand, even more crucially, I have to trust myself.
p45
aVThink about it: when you're in a position of not trusting,
p46
aVwhat do you do?
p47
aVYou overcompensate.
p48
aVAnd in my game, that means you overgesticulate.
p49
aVYou end up like some kind of rabid windmill.
p50
aVAnd the bigger your gesture gets,
p51
aVthe more ill-defined, blurry
p52
aVand, frankly, useless it is to the orchestra.
p53
aVYou become a figure of fun. There's no trust anymore, only ridicule.
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd I remember at the beginning of my career,
p56
aVagain and again, on these dismal outings with orchestras,
p57
aVI would be going completely insane on the podium,
p58
aVtrying to engender a small scale crescendo really,
p59
aVjust a little upsurge in volume.
p60
aVBugger me, they wouldn't give it to me.
p61
aVI spent a lot of time in those early years
p62
aVweeping silently in dressing rooms.
p63
aVAnd how futile seemed the words of advice to me
p64
aVfrom great British veteran conductor Sir Colin Davis
p65
aVwho said, "Conducting, Charles,
p66
aVis like holding a small bird in your hand.
p67
aVIf you hold it too tightly, you crush it.
p68
aVIf you hold it too loosely, it flies away."
p69
aVI have to say, in those days, I couldn't really even find the bird.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow a fundamental
p72
aVand really viscerally important experience for me, in terms of music,
p73
aVhas been my adventures in South Africa,
p74
aVthe most dizzyingly musical country on the planet in my view,
p75
aVbut a country which, through its musical culture,
p76
aVhas taught me one fundamental lesson:
p77
aVthat through music making
p78
aVcan come deep levels
p79
aVof fundamental life-giving trust.
p80
aVBack in 2000, I had the opportunity to go to South Africa
p81
aVto form a new opera company.
p82
aVSo I went out there, and I auditioned,
p83
aVmainly in rural township locations, right around the country.
p84
aVI heard about 2,000 singers
p85
aVand pulled together a company
p86
aVof 40 of the most jaw-droppingly amazing young performers,
p87
aVthe majority of whom were black,
p88
aVbut there were a handful of white performers.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow it emerged early on in the first rehearsal period
p91
aVthat one of those white performers
p92
aVhad, in his previous incarnation,
p93
aVbeen a member of the South African police force.
p94
aVAnd in the last years of the old regime,
p95
aVhe would routinely be detailed to go into the township
p96
aVto aggress the community.
p97
aVNow you can imagine what this knowledge did to the temperature in the room,
p98
aVthe general atmosphere.
p99
aVLet's be under no illusions.
p100
aVIn South Africa, the relationship most devoid of trust
p101
aVis that between a white policeman
p102
aVand the black community.
p103
aVSo how do we recover from that, ladies and gentlemen?
p104
aVSimply through singing.
p105
aVWe sang, we sang,
p106
aVwe sang,
p107
aVand amazingly new trust grew,
p108
aVand indeed friendship blossomed.
p109
aVAnd that showed me such a fundamental truth,
p110
aVthat music making and other forms of creativity
p111
aVcan so often go to places
p112
aVwhere mere words cannot.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo we got some shows off the ground. We started touring them internationally.
p115
aVOne of them was "Carmen."
p116
aVWe then thought we'd make a movie of "Carmen,"
p117
aVwhich we recorded and shot outside on location
p118
aVin the township outside Cape Town called Khayelitsha.
p119
aVThe piece was sung entirely in Xhosa,
p120
aVwhich is a beautifully musical language, if you don't know it.
p121
aVIt's called "U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha" \u2014
p122
aVliterally "Carmen of Khayelitsha."
p123
aVI want to play you a tiny clip of it now
p124
aVfor no other reason than to give you proof positive
p125
aVthat there is nothing tiny about South African music making.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Music)
p128
aa(lp129
V(Applause)
p130
aa(lp131
VSomething which I find utterly enchanting
p132
aVabout South African music making
p133
aVis that it's so free.
p134
aVSouth Africans just make music really freely.
p135
aVAnd I think, in no small way,
p136
aVthat's due to one fundamental fact:
p137
aVthey're not bound to a system of notation.
p138
aVThey don't read music.
p139
aVThey trust their ears.
p140
aVYou can teach a bunch of South Africans a tune in about five seconds flat.
p141
aVAnd then, as if by magic,
p142
aVthey will spontaneously improvise a load of harmony around that tune
p143
aVbecause they can.
p144
aVNow those of us that live in the West, if I can use that term,
p145
aVI think have a much more hidebound attitude or sense of music \u2014
p146
aVthat somehow it's all about skill and systems.
p147
aVTherefore it's the exclusive preserve
p148
aVof an elite, talented body.
p149
aVAnd yet, ladies and gentlemen, every single one of us on this planet
p150
aVprobably engages with music on a daily basis.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd if I can broaden this out for a second,
p153
aVI'm willing to bet that every single one of you sitting in this room
p154
aVwould be happy to speak with acuity, with total confidence,
p155
aVabout movies, probably about literature.
p156
aVBut how many of you would be able to make a confident assertion
p157
aVabout a piece of classical music?
p158
aVWhy is this?
p159
aVAnd what I'm going to say to you now
p160
aVis I'm just urging you to get over
p161
aVthis supreme lack of self-confidence,
p162
aVto take the plunge, to believe that you can trust your ears,
p163
aVyou can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue,
p164
aVfiber, DNA,
p165
aVwhat makes a great piece of music great.
p166
aVI've got a little experiment I want to try with you.
p167
aa(lp168
VDid you know
p169
aVthat TED is a tune?
p170
aVA very simple tune based on three notes \u2014 T, E, D.
p171
aVNow hang on a minute.
p172
aVI know you're going to say to me, "T doesn't exist in music."
p173
aVWell ladies and gentlemen, there's a time-honored system,
p174
aVwhich composers have been using for hundreds of years,
p175
aVwhich proves actually that it does.
p176
aVIf I sing you a musical scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G \u2014
p177
aVand I just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet, same scale:
p178
aVH, I, J, K, L, M, N,
p179
aVO, P, Q, R, S, T \u2014 there you go.
p180
aVT, see it's the same as F in music.
p181
aVSo T is F.
p182
aVSo T, E, D is the same as F, E, D.
p183
aVNow that piece of music that we played at the start of this session
p184
aVhad enshrined in its heart
p185
aVthe theme, which is TED.
p186
aVHave a listen.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Music)
p189
aa(lp190
VDo you hear it?
p191
aVOr do I smell some doubt in the room?
p192
aVOkay, we'll play it for you again now,
p193
aVand we're going to highlight, we're going to poke out the T, E, D.
p194
aVIf you'll pardon the expression.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Music)
p197
aa(lp198
VOh my goodness me, there it was loud and clear, surely.
p199
aVI think we should make this even more explicit.
p200
aVLadies and gentlemen, it's nearly time for tea.
p201
aVWould you reckon you need to sing for your tea, I think?
p202
aVI think we need to sing for our tea.
p203
aVWe're going to sing those three wonderful notes: T, E, D.
p204
aVWill you have a go for me?
p205
aa(lp206
VAudience: T, E, D.
p207
aa(lp208
VCharles Hazlewood: Yeah, you sound a bit more like cows really than human beings.
p209
aVShall we try that one again?
p210
aVAnd look, if you're adventurous, you go up the octave.
p211
aVT, E, D.
p212
aa(lp213
VAudience: T, E, D.
p214
aa(lp215
VCH: Once more with vim. (Audience: T, E, D.)
p216
aa(lp217
VThere I am like a bloody windmill again, you see.
p218
aVNow we're going to put that in the context of the music.
p219
aVThe music will start, and then at a signal from me, you will sing that.
p220
aV(Music)
p221
aVOne more time,
p222
aVwith feeling, ladies and gentlemen.
p223
aVYou won't make the key otherwise.
p224
aVWell done, ladies and gentlemen.
p225
aVIt wasn't a bad debut for the TED choir,
p226
aVnot a bad debut at all.
p227
aa(lp228
VNow there's a project that I'm initiating at the moment
p229
aVthat I'm very excited about and wanted to share with you,
p230
aVbecause it is all about changing perceptions,
p231
aVand, indeed, building a new level of trust.
p232
aVThe youngest of my children was born with cerebral palsy,
p233
aVwhich as you can imagine,
p234
aVif you don't have an experience of it yourself,
p235
aVis quite a big thing to take on board.
p236
aVBut the gift that my gorgeous daughter has given me,
p237
aVaside from her very existence,
p238
aVis that it's opened my eyes to a whole stretch of the community
p239
aVthat was hitherto hidden,
p240
aVthe community of disabled people.
p241
aVAnd I found myself looking at the Paralympics and thinking how incredible
p242
aVhow technology's been harnessed to prove beyond doubt
p243
aVthat disability is no barrier
p244
aVto the highest levels of sporting achievement.
p245
aVOf course there's a grimmer side to that truth,
p246
aVwhich is that it's actually taken decades for the world at large
p247
aVto come to a position of trust,
p248
aVto really believe that disability and sports can go together
p249
aVin a convincing and interesting fashion.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo I find myself asking:
p252
aVwhere is music in all of this?
p253
aVYou can't tell me that there aren't millions of disabled people,
p254
aVin the U.K. alone,
p255
aVwith massive musical potential.
p256
aVSo I decided to create a platform for that potential.
p257
aVIt's going to be Britain's first ever
p258
aVnational disabled orchestra.
p259
aVIt's called Paraorchestra.
p260
aa(lp261
VI'm going to show you a clip now
p262
aVof the very first improvisation session that we had.
p263
aVIt was a really extraordinary moment.
p264
aVJust me and four astonishingly gifted disabled musicians.
p265
aVNormally when you improvise \u2014
p266
aVand I do it all the time around the world \u2014
p267
aVthere's this initial period of horror,
p268
aVlike everyone's too frightened to throw the hat into the ring,
p269
aVan awful pregnant silence.
p270
aVThen suddenly, as if by magic, bang! We're all in there
p271
aVand it's complete bedlam. You can't hear anything.
p272
aVNo one's listening. No one's trusting.
p273
aVNo one's responding to each other.
p274
aVNow in this room with these four disabled musicians,
p275
aVwithin five minutes
p276
aVa rapt listening, a rapt response
p277
aVand some really insanely beautiful music.
p278
aa(lp279
V(Video) (Music)
p280
aa(lp281
VNicholas:: My name's Nicholas McCarthy.
p282
aVI'm 22, and I'm a left-handed pianist.
p283
aVAnd I was born without my left hand \u2014 right hand.
p284
aVCan I do that one again?
p285
aa(lp286
V(Music)
p287
aa(lp288
VLyn: When I'm making music,
p289
aVI feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane.
p290
aVI become alive.

p293
aa(lp294
VClarence: I would rather be able to play an instrument again
p295
aVthan walk.
p296
aVThere's so much joy and things
p297
aVI could get from playing an instrument and performing.
p298
aVIt's removed some of my paralysis.
p299
aa(lp300
V(Music)
p301
aa(lp302
V(Applause)
p303
aa(lp304
VCH: I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today,
p305
aVso you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are.
p306
aVParaorchestra is the name of that project.
p307
aVIf any of you thinks you want to help me in any way
p308
aVto achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point,
p309
aVplease let me know.
p310
aVNow my parting shot
p311
aVcomes courtesy of the great Joseph Haydn,
p312
aVwonderful Austrian composer in the second half of the 18th century \u2014
p313
aVspent the bulk of his life
p314
aVin the employ of Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy, along with his orchestra.
p315
aVNow this prince loved his music,
p316
aVbut he also loved the country castle that he tended to reside in most of the time,
p317
aVwhich is just on the Austro-Hungarian border,
p318
aVa place called Esterhazy \u2014
p319
aVa long way from the big city of Vienna.
p320
aa(lp321
VNow one day in 1772,
p322
aVthe prince decreed that the musicians' families,
p323
aVthe orchestral musicians' families,
p324
aVwere no longer welcome in the castle.
p325
aVThey weren't allowed to stay there anymore; they had to be returned to Vienna \u2014
p326
aVas I say, an unfeasibly long way away in those days.
p327
aVYou can imagine, the musicians were disconsolate.
p328
aVHaydn remonstrated with the prince, but to no avail.
p329
aVSo given the prince loved his music,
p330
aVHaydn thought he'd write a symphony to make the point.
p331
aa(lp332
VAnd we're going to play just the very tail end of this symphony now.
p333
aVAnd you'll see the orchestra in a kind of sullen revolt.
p334
aVI'm pleased to say, the prince did take the tip
p335
aVfrom the orchestral performance,
p336
aVand the musicians were reunited with their families.
p337
aVBut I think it sums up my talk rather well, this,
p338
aVthat where there is trust,
p339
aVthere is music \u2014 by extension life.
p340
aVWhere there is no trust,
p341
aVthe music quite simply withers away.
