VBack in New York, I am the head of development
p4
aVfor a non-profit called Robin Hood.
p5
aVWhen I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires
p6
aVas the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.
p7
aVNow in our town,
p8
aVwhere the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff,
p9
aVyou have to get to the fire scene pretty early
p10
aVto get in on any action.
p11
aa(lp12
VI remember my first fire.
p13
aVI was the second volunteer on the scene,
p14
aVso there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.
p15
aVBut still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers
p16
aVto get to the captain in charge
p17
aVto find out what our assignments would be.
p18
aVWhen I found the captain,
p19
aVhe was having a very engaging conversation
p20
aVwith the homeowner,
p21
aVwho was surely having one of the worst days of her life.
p22
aVHere it was, the middle of the night,
p23
aVshe was standing outside in the pouring rain,
p24
aVunder an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot,
p25
aVwhile her house was in flames.
p26
aa(lp27
VThe other volunteer who had arrived just before me \u2014
p28
aVlet's call him Lex Luther \u2014
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVgot to the captain first
p31
aVand was asked to go inside
p32
aVand save the homeowner's dog.
p33
aVThe dog! I was stunned with jealousy.
p34
aVHere was some lawyer or money manager
p35
aVwho, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people
p36
aVthat he went into a burning building
p37
aVto save a living creature,
p38
aVjust because he beat me by five seconds.
p39
aVWell, I was next.
p40
aVThe captain waved me over.
p41
aVHe said, "Bezos, I need you to go into the house.
p42
aVI need you to go upstairs, past the fire,
p43
aVand I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes."
p44
aV(Laughter)
p45
aVI swear.
p46
aVSo, not exactly what I was hoping for,
p47
aVbut off I went \u2014
p48
aVup the stairs, down the hall, past the 'real' firefighters,
p49
aVwho were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point,
p50
aVinto the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow I know what you're thinking,
p53
aVbut I'm no hero.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVI carried my payload back downstairs
p56
aVwhere I met my nemesis
p57
aVand the precious dog by the front door.
p58
aVWe took our treasures outside to the homeowner,
p59
aVwhere, not surprisingly,
p60
aVhis received much more attention than did mine.
p61
aVA few weeks later,
p62
aVthe department received a letter from the homeowner
p63
aVthanking us for the valiant effort displayed
p64
aVin saving her home.
p65
aVThe act of kindness she noted above all others:
p66
aVsomeone had even gotten her a pair of shoes.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VIn both my vocation at Robin Hood
p71
aVand my avocation as a volunteer firefighter,
p72
aVI am witness to acts of generosity and kindness
p73
aVon a monumental scale,
p74
aVbut I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage
p75
aVon an individual basis.
p76
aVAnd you know what I've learned?
p77
aVThey all matter.
p78
aVSo as I look around this room
p79
aVat people who either have achieved,
p80
aVor are on their way to achieving,
p81
aVremarkable levels of success,
p82
aVI would offer this reminder:
p83
aVdon't wait.
p84
aVDon't wait until you make your first million
p85
aVto make a difference in somebody's life.
p86
aVIf you have something to give,
p87
aVgive it now.
p88
aVServe food at a soup kitchen. Clean up a neighborhood park.
p89
aVBe a mentor.
p90
aa(lp91
VNot every day is going to offer us a chance
p92
aVto save somebody's life,
p93
aVbut every day offers us an opportunity to affect one.
p94
aVSo get in the game. Save the shoes.
p95
aa(lp96
VThank you.
