VWhat I want to do this afternoon
p4
aVis something a little different than what's scheduled.
p5
aVForeign policy, you can figure that out
p6
aVby watching, I don't know, Rachel Maddow or somebody,
p7
aVbut \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p8
aa(lp9
VI want to talk about young people and structure,
p10
aVyoung people and structure.
p11
aVThis was last Wednesday afternoon
p12
aVat a school in Brooklyn, New York,
p13
aVat Cristo Rey High School, run by the Jesuits.
p14
aVAnd I was talking to this group of students, and take a look at them.
p15
aVThey were around me in three directions.
p16
aVYou'll noticed that almost all of them are minority.
p17
aVYou'll notice that the building is rather austere.
p18
aVIt's an old New York school building, nothing fancy.
p19
aVThey still have old blackboards and whatnot.
p20
aVAnd there are about 300 kids in this school,
p21
aVand the school's been going now for four years,
p22
aVand they're about to graduate their first class.
p23
aVTwenty-two people are graduating,
p24
aVand all 22 are going to college.
p25
aVThey all come from homes where there is, for the most part,
p26
aVjust one person in the home,
p27
aVusually the mother or the grandmother, and that's it,
p28
aVand they come here for their education
p29
aVand for their structure.
p30
aa(lp31
VNow I had this picture taken, and it was put up
p32
aVon my Facebook page last week,
p33
aVand somebody wrote in,
p34
aV"Huh, why does he have him standing at attention like that?"
p35
aVAnd then they said, "But he looks good." (Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VHe does look good, because kids need structure,
p38
aVand the trick I play in all of my school appearances
p39
aVis that when I get through with my little homily to the kids,
p40
aVI then invite them to ask questions,
p41
aVand when they raise their hands, I say, "Come up,"
p42
aVand I make them come up and stand in front of me.
p43
aVI make them stand at attention like a soldier.
p44
aVPut your arms straight down at your side,
p45
aVlook up, open your eyes, stare straight ahead,
p46
aVand speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear.
p47
aVNo slouching, no pants hanging down, none of that stuff.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVAnd this young man, his name is \u2014 his last name Cruz \u2014
p50
aVhe loved it. That's all over his Facebook page and it's gone viral.
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aVSo people think I'm being unkind to this kid.
p53
aVNo, we're having a little fun.
p54
aVAnd the thing about it, I've done this for years,
p55
aVthe younger they are, the more fun it is.
p56
aa(lp57
VWhen I get six- and seven-year-olds in a group,
p58
aVI have to figure out how to keep them quiet.
p59
aVYou know that they'll always start yakking.
p60
aVAnd so I play a little game with them
p61
aVbefore I make them stand at attention.
p62
aa(lp63
VI say, "Now listen. In the army,
p64
aVwhen we want you to pay attention,
p65
aVwe have a command. It's called 'at ease.'
p66
aVIt means everybody be quiet and pay attention. Listen up.
p67
aVDo you understand?"
p68
aa(lp69
V"Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.""Let's practice. Everybody start chatting."
p70
aVAnd I let them go for about 10 seconds, then I go, "At ease!"
p71
aa(lp72
V"Huh!" (Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
V"Yes, General. Yes, General."
p75
aa(lp76
VTry it with your kids. See if it works. (Laughter)
p77
aVI don't think so.
p78
aa(lp79
VBut anyway, it's a game I play, and it comes obviously
p80
aVfrom my military experience.
p81
aVBecause for the majority of my adult life,
p82
aVI worked with young kids, teenagers with guns, I call them.
p83
aVAnd we would bring them into the army,
p84
aVand the first thing we would do is to put them
p85
aVin an environment of structure, put them in ranks,
p86
aVmake them all wear the same clothes,
p87
aVcut all their hair off so they look alike,
p88
aVmake sure that they are standing in ranks.
p89
aVWe teach them how to go right face, left face,
p90
aVso they can obey instructions and know
p91
aVthe consequences of not obeying instructions.
p92
aVIt gives them structure.
p93
aVAnd then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately, the drill sergeant.
p94
aVAnd they hate him.
p95
aVAnd the drill sergeant starts screaming at them,
p96
aVand telling them to do all kinds of awful things.
p97
aVBut then the most amazing thing happens over time.
p98
aVOnce that structure is developed,
p99
aVonce they understand the reason for something,
p100
aVonce they understand, "Mama ain't here, son.
p101
aVI'm your worst nightmare. I'm your daddy and your mommy.
p102
aVAnd that's just the way it is. You got that, son?
p103
aVYeah, and then when I ask you a question, there are only three possible answers:
p104
aVyes, sir; no, sir; and no excuse, sir.
p105
aVDon't start telling me why you didn't do something.
p106
aVIt's yes, sir; no, sir; no excuse, sir."
p107
aa(lp108
V"You didn't shave.""But sir \u2014"
p109
aa(lp110
V"No, don't tell me how often you scraped your face this morning.
p111
aVI'm telling you you didn't shave."
p112
aa(lp113
V"No excuse, sir.""Attaboy, you're learning fast."
p114
aa(lp115
VBut you'd be amazed at what you can do with them
p116
aVonce you put them in that structure.
p117
aVIn 18 weeks, they have a skill. They are mature.
p118
aVAnd you know what, they come to admire the drill sergeant
p119
aVand they never forget the drill sergeant.
p120
aVThey come to respect him.
p121
aVAnd so we need more of this kind of structure and respect
p122
aVin the lives of our children.
p123
aa(lp124
VI spend a lot of time with youth groups,
p125
aVand I say to people, "When does the education process begin?"
p126
aVWe're always talking about, "Let's fix the schools.
p127
aVLet's do more for our teachers. Let's put more computers in our schools.
p128
aVLet's get it all online."
p129
aa(lp130
VThat isn't the whole answer. It's part of the answer.
p131
aVBut the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school
p132
aVwith structure in that child's heart and soul to begin with.
p133
aa(lp134
VWhen does the learning process begin? Does it begin in first grade?
p135
aVNo, no, it begins the first time
p136
aVa child in a mother's arms
p137
aVlooks up at the mother
p138
aVand says, "Oh, this must be my mother.
p139
aVShe's the one who feeds me.
p140
aVOh yeah, when I don't feel so good down there,
p141
aVshe takes care of me.
p142
aVIt's her language I will learn."
p143
aVAnd at that moment they shut out all the other languages
p144
aVthat they could be learning at that age,
p145
aVbut by three months, that's her.
p146
aVAnd if the person doing it, whether it's the mother
p147
aVor grandmother, whoever's doing it,
p148
aVthat is when the education process begins.
p149
aVThat's when language begins.
p150
aVThat's when love begins. That's when structure begins.
p151
aVThat's when you start to imprint on the child
p152
aVthat "you are special,
p153
aVyou are different from every other child in the world.
p154
aVAnd we're going to read to you."
p155
aVA child who has not been read to
p156
aVis in danger when that child gets to school.
p157
aVA child who doesn't know his or her colors
p158
aVor doesn't know how to tell time, doesn't know how to tie shoes,
p159
aVdoesn't know how to do those things,
p160
aVand doesn't know how to do something that
p161
aVgoes by a word that was drilled into me as a kid: mind.
p162
aVMind your manners! Mind your adults! Mind what you're saying!
p163
aVThis is the way children are raised properly.
p164
aVAnd I watched my own young grandchildren now come along
p165
aVand they're, much to the distress of my children,
p166
aVthey are acting just like we did. You know? You imprint them.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd that's what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school.
p169
aVAnd I'm working at all the energy I have
p170
aVto sort of communicate this message that
p171
aVwe need preschool, we need Head Start,
p172
aVwe need prenatal care.
p173
aVThe education process begins even before the child is born,
p174
aVand if you don't do that, you're going to have difficulty.
p175
aVAnd we are having difficulties in so many of our communities
p176
aVand so many of our schools where kids are coming
p177
aVto first grade and their eyes are blazing,
p178
aVthey've got their little knapsack on and they're ready to go,
p179
aVand then they realize they're not like the other first graders
p180
aVwho know books, have been read to, can do their alphabet.
p181
aVAnd by the third grade, the kids who didn't have
p182
aVthat structure and minding in the beginning
p183
aVstart to realize they're behind, and what do they do?
p184
aVThey act it out. They act it out, and they're on their way
p185
aVto jail or they're on their way to being dropouts.
p186
aVIt's predictable.
p187
aVIf you're not at the right reading level at third grade,
p188
aVyou are a candidate for jail at age 18,
p189
aVand we have the highest incarceration rate
p190
aVbecause we're not getting our kids the proper start in life.
p191
aa(lp192
VThe last chapter in my book is called
p193
aV"The Gift of a Good Start."
p194
aVThe gift of a good start. Every child ought to have a good start in life.
p195
aa(lp196
VI was privileged to have that kind of good start.
p197
aVI was not a great student.
p198
aVI was a public school kid in New York City,
p199
aVand I didn't do well at all.
p200
aVI have my entire New York City Board of Education transcript
p201
aVfrom kindergarten through college.
p202
aVI wanted it when I was writing my first book.
p203
aVI wanted to see if my memory was correct,
p204
aVand, my God, it was. (Laughter)
p205
aVStraight C everywhere.
p206
aVAnd I finally bounced through high school,
p207
aVgot into the City College of New York
p208
aVwith a 78.3 average, which I shouldn't have been allowed in with,
p209
aVand then I started out in engineering,
p210
aVand that only lasted six months. (Laughter)
p211
aVAnd then I went into geology, "rocks for jocks." This is easy.
p212
aVAnd then I found ROTC.
p213
aVI found something that I did well and something that I loved doing,
p214
aVand I found a group of youngsters like me who felt the same way.
p215
aVAnd so my whole life then was dedicated to ROTC and the military.
p216
aVAnd I say to young kids everywhere, as you're growing up
p217
aVand as this structure is being developed inside of you,
p218
aValways be looking for that which you do well and that which you love doing,
p219
aVand when you find those two things together, man, you got it.
p220
aVThat's what's going on. And that's what I found.
p221
aa(lp222
VNow the authorities at CCNY were getting tired of me being there.
p223
aVI'd been there four and a half going on five years,
p224
aVand my grades were not doing particularly well,
p225
aVand I was in occasional difficulties with the administration.
p226
aVAnd so they said, "But he does so well in ROTC.
p227
aVLook, he gets straight A's in that but not in anything else."
p228
aVAnd so they said, "Look, let's take his ROTC grades
p229
aVand roll them into his overall GPA and see what happens."
p230
aVAnd they did, and it brought me up to 2.0. (Laughter)
p231
aVYep. (Laughter) (Applause)
p232
aVThey said, "It's good enough for government work.
p233
aVGive him to the army. We'll never see him again. We'll never see him again."
p234
aVSo they shipped me off to the army,
p235
aVand lo and behold, many years later,
p236
aVI'm considered one of the greatest sons the City College of New York has ever had. (Laughter)
p237
aVSo, I tell young people everywhere,
p238
aVit ain't where you start in life, it's what you do with life
p239
aVthat determines where you end up in life,
p240
aVand you are blessed to be living in a country that,
p241
aVno matter where you start, you have opportunities
p242
aVso long as you believe in yourself,
p243
aVyou believe in the society and the country,
p244
aVand you believe that you can self-improve
p245
aVand educate yourself as you go along.
p246
aVAnd that's the key to success.
p247
aa(lp248
VBut it begins with the gift of a good start.
p249
aVIf we don't give that gift to each and every one of our kids,
p250
aVif we don't invest at the earliest age,
p251
aVwe're going to be running into difficulties.
p252
aVIt's why we have a dropout rate of roughly 25 percent overall
p253
aVand almost 50 percent of our minority population
p254
aVliving in low-income areas,
p255
aVbecause they're not getting the gift of a good start.
p256
aa(lp257
VMy gift of a good start was not only being in a nice family,
p258
aVa good family, but having a family that said to me,
p259
aV"Now listen, we came to this country in banana boats
p260
aVin 1920 and 1924.
p261
aVWe worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day.
p262
aVWe're not doing it so that you can stick something up your nose
p263
aVor get in trouble. And don't even think about dropping out."
p264
aVIf I had ever gone home and told those immigrant people
p265
aVthat, "You know, I'm tired of school and I'm dropping out,"
p266
aVthey'd said, "We're dropping you out. We'll get another kid."
p267
aV(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
VThey had expectations for all of the cousins
p270
aVand the extended family of immigrants that lived in the South Bronx,
p271
aVbut they had more than just expectations for us.
p272
aVThey stuck into our hearts like a dagger
p273
aVa sense of shame: "Don't you shame this family."
p274
aVSometimes I would get in trouble,
p275
aVand my parents were coming home,
p276
aVand I was in my room waiting for what's going to happen,
p277
aVand I would sit there saying to myself, "Okay, look,
p278
aVtake the belt and hit me, but, God, don't give me that 'shame the family' bit again."
p279
aVIt devastated me when my mother did that to me.
p280
aa(lp281
VAnd I also had this extended network.
p282
aVChildren need a network. Children need to be part of a tribe,
p283
aVa family, a community.
p284
aVIn my case it was aunts who lived in all of these tenement buildings.
p285
aVI don't know how many of you are New Yorkers,
p286
aVbut there were these tenement buildings,
p287
aVand these women were always hanging out one of the windows,
p288
aVleaning on a pillow.
p289
aVThey never left. (Laughter)
p290
aVI, so help me God, I grew up walking those streets,
p291
aVand they were always there.
p292
aVThey never went to the bathroom. They never cooked. (Laughter)
p293
aVThey never did anything.
p294
aVBut what they did was keep us in play.
p295
aVThey kept us in play.
p296
aVAnd they didn't care
p297
aVwhether you became a doctor or a lawyer or a general,
p298
aVand they never expected any generals in the family,
p299
aVas long as you got an education and then you got a job.
p300
aa(lp301
V"Don't give us any of that self-actualization stuff.
p302
aVYou get a job and get out of the house.
p303
aVWe don't have time to waste for that.
p304
aVAnd then you can support us. That's the role of you guys."
p305
aa(lp306
VAnd so, it's so essential that we kind of put this culture
p307
aVback into our families, all families.
p308
aVAnd it is so important that all of you here today
p309
aVwho are successful people,
p310
aVand I'm sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren,
p311
aVit's not enough. You've got to reach out and back
p312
aVand find kids like Mr. Cruz
p313
aVwho can make it if you give them the structure,
p314
aVif you reach back and help, if you mentor,
p315
aVif you invest in boys and girls clubs,
p316
aVif you work with your school system,
p317
aVmake sure it's the best school system,
p318
aVand not just your kid's school, but the school uptown in Harlem,
p319
aVnot just downtown Montessori on the West Side.
p320
aVAll of us have to have a commitment to do that.
p321
aVAnd we're not just investing in the kids.
p322
aVWe're investing in our future.
p323
aa(lp324
VWe're going to be a minority-majority country
p325
aVin one more generation.
p326
aVThose that we call minorities now are going to be the majority.
p327
aVAnd we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority.
p328
aVWe have to make sure they're ready to be the leaders
p329
aVof this great country of ours,
p330
aVa country that is like no other,
p331
aVa country that amazes me every single day,
p332
aVa country that's fractious. We're always arguing with each other.
p333
aVThat's how the system's supposed to work.
p334
aVIt's a country of such contrasts, but it's a nation of nations.
p335
aVWe touch every nation. Every nation touches us.
p336
aVWe are a nation of immigrants.
p337
aVThat's why we need sound immigration policy.
p338
aVIt's ridiculous not to have a sound immigration policy
p339
aVto welcome those who want to come here and be part of this great nation,
p340
aVor we can send back home with an education
p341
aVto help their people rise up out of poverty.
p342
aVOne of the great stories I love to tell is about my love
p343
aVof going to my hometown of New York
p344
aVand walking up Park Avenue on a beautiful day
p345
aVand admiring everything and seeing all the people go by
p346
aVfrom all over the world.
p347
aVBut what I always have to do is stop at one of the corners
p348
aVand get a hot dog from the immigrant pushcart peddler.
p349
aVGotta have a dirty water dog. (Laughter)
p350
aVAnd no matter where I am or what I'm doing,
p351
aVI've got to do that.
p352
aVI even did it when I was Secretary of State.
p353
aVI'd come out of my suite at the Waldorf Astoria
p354
aV\u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p355
aVbe walking up the street, and I would hit around 55th Street
p356
aVlooking for the immigrant pushcart peddler.
p357
aVIn those days, I had five bodyguards around me
p358
aVand three New York City police cars would roll alongside
p359
aVto make sure nobody whacked me while I was going up Park Avenue. (Laughter)
p360
aVAnd I would order the hot dog from the guy,
p361
aVand he'd start to fix it, and then he'd look around
p362
aVat the bodyguards and the police cars \u2014
p363
aV"I've got a green card! I've got a green card!" (Laughter)
p364
aV"It's okay, it's okay."
p365
aa(lp366
VBut now I'm alone. I'm alone.
p367
aVI've got no bodyguards, I've got no police cars. I've got nothing.
p368
aVBut I gotta have my hot dog.
p369
aa(lp370
VI did it just last week. It was on a Tuesday evening
p371
aVdown by Columbus Circle.
p372
aVAnd the scene repeats itself so often.
p373
aVI'll go up and ask for my hot dog,
p374
aVand the guy will fix it, and as he's finishing,
p375
aVhe'll say, "I know you. I see you on television.
p376
aa(lp377
VYou're, well, you're General Powell."
p378
aa(lp379
V"Yes, yes.""Oh ... "
p380
aa(lp381
VI hand him the money.
p382
aa(lp383
V"No, General. You can't pay me. I've been paid.
p384
aVAmerica has paid me. I never forget where I came from.
p385
aVBut now I'm an American. Sir, thank you."
p386
aa(lp387
VI accept the generosity, continue up the street,
p388
aVand it washes over me, my God,
p389
aVit's the same country that greeted my parents this way 90 years ago.
p390
aa(lp391
VSo we are still that magnificent country,
p392
aVbut we are fueled by young people coming up
p393
aVfrom every land in the world,
p394
aVand it is our obligation as contributing citizens
p395
aVto this wonderful country of ours
p396
aVto make sure that no child gets left behind.
p397
aa(lp398
VThank you very much.
