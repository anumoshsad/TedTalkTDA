VIf I could reveal anything
p4
aVthat is hidden from us,
p5
aVat least in modern cultures,
p6
aVit would be to reveal something that we've forgotten,
p7
aVthat we used to know
p8
aVas well as we knew our own names.
p9
aVAnd that is that we live in a competent universe,
p10
aVthat we are part of a brilliant planet,
p11
aVand that we are surrounded by genius.
p12
aa(lp13
VBiomimicry is a new discipline
p14
aVthat tries to learn from those geniuses,
p15
aVand take advice from them, design advice.
p16
aVThat's where I live,
p17
aVand it's my university as well.
p18
aVI'm surrounded by genius. I cannot help but
p19
aVremember the organisms and the ecosystems
p20
aVthat know how to live here gracefully on this planet.
p21
aVThis is what I would tell you to remember
p22
aVif you ever forget this again.
p23
aVRemember this.
p24
aVThis is what happens every year.
p25
aVThis is what keeps its promise.
p26
aVWhile we're doing bailouts, this is what happened.
p27
aVSpring.
p28
aa(lp29
VImagine designing spring.
p30
aVImagine that orchestration.
p31
aVYou think TED is hard to organize. (Laughter) Right?
p32
aVImagine, and if you haven't done this in a while, do.
p33
aVImagine the timing, the coordination,
p34
aVall without top-down laws,
p35
aVor policies, or climate change protocols.
p36
aVThis happens every year.
p37
aVThere is lots of showing off.
p38
aVThere is lots of love in the air.
p39
aVThere's lots of grand openings.
p40
aVAnd the organisms, I promise you,
p41
aVhave all of their priorities in order.
p42
aa(lp43
VI have this neighbor that keeps me in touch with this,
p44
aVbecause he's living, usually on his back,
p45
aVlooking up at those grasses.
p46
aVAnd one time he came up to me \u2014
p47
aVhe was about seven or eight years old \u2014 he came up to me.
p48
aVAnd there was a wasp's nest
p49
aVthat I had let grow in my yard,
p50
aVright outside my door.
p51
aVAnd most people knock them down when they're small.
p52
aVBut it was fascinating to me,
p53
aVbecause I was looking at this sort of fine Italian end papers.
p54
aVAnd he came up to me and he knocked.
p55
aVHe would come every day with something to show me.
p56
aVAnd like, knock like a woodpecker on my door until I opened it up.
p57
aVAnd he asked me
p58
aVhow I had made the house for those wasps,
p59
aVbecause he had never seen one this big.
p60
aVAnd I told him, "You know, Cody,
p61
aVthe wasps actually made that."
p62
aVAnd we looked at it together.
p63
aVAnd I could see why he thought,
p64
aVyou know \u2014 it was so beautifully done.
p65
aVIt was so architectural. It was so precise.
p66
aa(lp67
VBut it occurred to me, how in his small life
p68
aVhad he already believed the myth
p69
aVthat if something was that well done,
p70
aVthat we must have done it.
p71
aVHow did he not know \u2014
p72
aVit's what we've all forgotten \u2014
p73
aVthat we're not the first ones to build.
p74
aVWe're not the first ones to process cellulose.
p75
aVWe're not the first ones to make paper. We're not the first ones
p76
aVto try to optimize packing space,
p77
aVor to waterproof, or to try to heat and cool a structure.
p78
aVWe're not the first ones to build houses for our young.
p79
aa(lp80
VWhat's happening now, in this field called biomimicry,
p81
aVis that people are beginning to remember
p82
aVthat organisms, other organisms,
p83
aVthe rest of the natural world,
p84
aVare doing things very similar to what we need to do.
p85
aVBut in fact they are doing them in a way
p86
aVthat have allowed them to live gracefully on this planet
p87
aVfor billions of years.
p88
aVSo these people, biomimics,
p89
aVare nature's apprentices.
p90
aVAnd they're focusing on function.
p91
aVWhat I'd like to do is show you a few of the things
p92
aVthat they're learning.
p93
aVThey have asked themselves,
p94
aV"What if, every time I started to invent something,
p95
aVI asked, 'How would nature solve this?'"
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd here is what they're learning.
p98
aVThis is an amazing picture from a Czech photographer named Jack Hedley.
p99
aVThis is a story about an engineer at J.R. West.
p100
aVThey're the people who make the bullet train.
p101
aVIt was called the bullet train
p102
aVbecause it was rounded in front,
p103
aVbut every time it went into a tunnel
p104
aVit would build up a pressure wave,
p105
aVand then it would create like a sonic boom when it exited.
p106
aVSo the engineer's boss said,
p107
aV"Find a way to quiet this train."
p108
aa(lp109
VHe happened to be a birder.
p110
aVHe went to the equivalent of an Audubon Society meeting.
p111
aVAnd he studied \u2014 there was a film about king fishers.
p112
aVAnd he thought to himself, "They go from one density of medium,
p113
aVthe air, into another density of medium, water,
p114
aVwithout a splash. Look at this picture.
p115
aVWithout a splash, so they can see the fish.
p116
aVAnd he thought, "What if we do this?"
p117
aVQuieted the train.
p118
aVMade it go 10 percent faster on 15 percent less electricity.
p119
aa(lp120
VHow does nature repel bacteria?
p121
aVWe're not the first ones to have to protect ourselves
p122
aVfrom some bacteria.
p123
aVTurns out that \u2014 this is a Galapagos Shark.
p124
aVIt has no bacteria on its surface, no fouling on its surface, no barnacles.
p125
aVAnd it's not because it goes fast.
p126
aVIt actually basks. It's a slow-moving shark.
p127
aVSo how does it keep its body free of bacteria build-up?
p128
aVIt doesn't do it with a chemical.
p129
aVIt does it, it turns out, with the same denticles
p130
aVthat you had on Speedo bathing suits,
p131
aVthat broke all those records in the Olympics,
p132
aa(lp133
Vbut it's a particular kind of pattern.
p134
aVAnd that pattern, the architecture of that pattern
p135
aVon its skin denticles
p136
aVkeep bacteria from being able to land and adhere.
p137
aVThere is a company called Sharklet Technologies
p138
aVthat's now putting this on the surfaces in hospitals
p139
aVto keep bacteria from landing,
p140
aVwhich is better than dousing it with anti-bacterials or harsh cleansers
p141
aVthat many, many organisms are now becoming drug resistant.
p142
aVHospital-acquired infections are now killing
p143
aVmore people every year in the United States
p144
aVthan die from AIDS or cancer or car accidents combined \u2014
p145
aVabout 100,000.
p146
aa(lp147
VThis is a little critter that's in the Namibian desert.
p148
aVIt has no fresh water that it's able to drink,
p149
aVbut it drinks water out of fog.
p150
aVIt's got bumps on the back of its wing covers.
p151
aVAnd those bumps act like a magnet for water.
p152
aVThey have water-loving tips, and waxy sides.
p153
aVAnd the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips.
p154
aVAnd it goes down the sides and goes into the critter's mouth.
p155
aVThere is actually a scientist here at Oxford
p156
aVwho studied this, Andrew Parker.
p157
aVAnd now kinetic and architectural firms like Grimshaw
p158
aVare starting to look at this as a way
p159
aVof coating buildings
p160
aVso that they gather water from the fog.
p161
aV10 times better than our fog-catching nets.
p162
aa(lp163
VCO2 as a building block.
p164
aVOrganisms don't think of CO2 as a poison.
p165
aVPlants and organisms that make shells,
p166
aVcoral, think of it as a building block.
p167
aVThere is now a cement manufacturing company
p168
aVstarting in the United States called Calera.
p169
aVThey've borrowed the recipe from the coral reef,
p170
aVand they're using CO2 as a building block
p171
aVin cement, in concrete.
p172
aVInstead of \u2014 cement usually
p173
aVemits a ton of CO2 for every ton of cement.
p174
aVNow it's reversing that equation,
p175
aVand actually sequestering half a ton of CO2
p176
aVthanks to the recipe from the coral.
p177
aa(lp178
VNone of these are using the organisms.
p179
aVThey're really only using the blueprints or the recipes
p180
aVfrom the organisms.
p181
aVHow does nature gather the sun's energy?
p182
aVThis is a new kind of solar cell
p183
aVthat's based on how a leaf works.
p184
aVIt's self-assembling.
p185
aVIt can be put down on any substrate whatsoever.
p186
aVIt's extremely inexpensive
p187
aVand rechargeable every five years.
p188
aVIt's actually a company a company that I'm involved in called OneSun,
p189
aVwith Paul Hawken.
p190
aa(lp191
VThere are many many ways that nature filters water
p192
aVthat takes salt out of water.
p193
aVWe take water and push it against a membrane.
p194
aVAnd then we wonder why the membrane clogs
p195
aVand why it takes so much electricity.
p196
aVNature does something much more elegant.
p197
aVAnd it's in every cell.
p198
aVEvery red blood cell of your body right now
p199
aVhas these hourglass-shaped pores
p200
aVcalled aquaporins.
p201
aVThey actually export water molecules through.
p202
aVIt's kind of a forward osmosis.
p203
aVThey export water molecules through,
p204
aVand leave solutes on the other side.
p205
aVA company called Aquaporin is starting to make desalination
p206
aVmembranes mimicking this technology.
p207
aa(lp208
VTrees and bones are constantly reforming themselves
p209
aValong lines of stress.
p210
aVThis algorithm has been put into a software program
p211
aVthat's now being used to make bridges lightweight,
p212
aVto make building beams lightweight.
p213
aVActually G.M. Opel used it
p214
aVto create that skeleton you see,
p215
aVin what's called their bionic car.
p216
aVIt lightweighted that skeleton using a minimum amount of material,
p217
aVas an organism must,
p218
aVfor the maximum amount of strength.
p219
aa(lp220
VThis beetle, unlike this chip bag here,
p221
aVthis beetle uses one material, chitin.
p222
aVAnd it finds many many ways
p223
aVto put many functions into it.
p224
aVIt's waterproof.
p225
aVIt's strong and resilient.
p226
aVIt's breathable. It creates color through structure.
p227
aVWhereas that chip bag has about seven layers to do all of those things.
p228
aVOne of our major inventions
p229
aVthat we need to be able to do
p230
aVto come even close to what these organisms can do
p231
aVis to find a way
p232
aVto minimize the amount of material, the kind of material we use,
p233
aVand to add design to it.
p234
aVWe use five polymers in the natural world
p235
aVto do everything that you see.
p236
aVIn our world we use about 350 polymers
p237
aVto make all this.
p238
aa(lp239
VNature is nano.
p240
aVNanotechnology, nanoparticles, you hear a lot of worry about this.
p241
aVLoose nanoparticles. What is really interesting to me
p242
aVis that not many people have been asking,
p243
aV"How can we consult nature about how to make nanotechnology safe?"
p244
aVNature has been doing that for a long time.
p245
aVEmbedding nanoparticles in a material for instance, always.
p246
aVIn fact, sulfur-reducing bacteria,
p247
aVas part of their synthesis,
p248
aVthey will emit, as a byproduct,
p249
aVnanoparticles into the water.
p250
aVBut then right after that, they emit a protein
p251
aVthat actually gathers and aggregates those nanoparticles
p252
aVso that they fall out of solution.
p253
aa(lp254
VEnergy use. Organisms sip energy,
p255
aVbecause they have to work or barter for every single bit that they get.
p256
aVAnd one of the largest fields right now,
p257
aVin the world of energy grids,
p258
aVyou hear about the smart grid.
p259
aVOne of the largest consultants are the social insects.
p260
aVSwarm technology. There is a company called Regen.
p261
aVThey are looking at how ants and bees
p262
aVfind their food and their flowers
p263
aVin the most effective way
p264
aVas a whole hive.
p265
aVAnd they're having appliances in your home
p266
aVtalk to one another through that algorithm,
p267
aVand determine how to minimize peak power use.
p268
aa(lp269
VThere's a group of scientists in Cornell
p270
aVthat are making what they call a synthetic tree,
p271
aVbecause they are saying, "There is no pump at the bottom of a tree."
p272
aVIt's capillary action and transpiration pulls
p273
aVwater up, a drop at a time,
p274
aVpulling it, releasing it from a leaf and pulling it up through the roots.
p275
aVAnd they're creating \u2014 you can think of it as a kind of wallpaper.
p276
aVThey're thinking about putting it on the insides of buildings
p277
aVto move water up without pumps.
p278
aa(lp279
VAmazon electric eel \u2014 incredibly endangered,
p280
aVsome of these species \u2014
p281
aVcreate 600 volts of electricity
p282
aVwith the chemicals that are in your body.
p283
aVEven more interesting to me is that
p284
aV600 volts doesn't fry it.
p285
aVYou know we use PVC, and we sheath wires
p286
aVwith PVC for insulation.
p287
aVThese organisms, how are they insulating
p288
aVagainst their own electric charge?
p289
aVThese are some questions that we've yet to ask.
p290
aa(lp291
VHere's a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale.
p292
aVHumpback whale has scalloped edges on its flippers.
p293
aVAnd those scalloped edges
p294
aVplay with flow in such a way
p295
aVthat is reduces drag by 32 percent.
p296
aVThese wind turbines can rotate in incredibly slow windspeeds, as a result.
p297
aa(lp298
VMIT just has a new radio chip
p299
aVthat uses far less power than our chips.
p300
aVAnd it's based on the cochlear of your ear,
p301
aVable to pick up internet, wireless, television signals
p302
aVand radio signals, in the same chip.
p303
aVFinally, on an ecosystem scale.
p304
aa(lp305
VAt Biomimicry Guild, which is my consulting company,
p306
aVwe work with HOK Architects.
p307
aVWe're looking at building whole cities
p308
aVin their planning department.
p309
aVAnd what we're saying is that,
p310
aVshouldn't our cities do at least as well,
p311
aVin terms of ecosystem services,
p312
aVas the native systems that they replace?
p313
aVSo we're creating something called Ecological Performance Standards
p314
aVthat hold cities to this higher bar.
p315
aa(lp316
VThe question is \u2014 biomimicry is an incredibly powerful
p317
aVway to innovate.
p318
aVThe question I would ask is, "What's worth solving?"
p319
aVIf you haven't seen this, it's pretty amazing.
p320
aVDr. Adam Neiman.
p321
aVThis is a depiction of
p322
aVall of the water on Earth
p323
aVin relation to the volume of the Earth \u2014
p324
aVall the ice, all the fresh water, all the sea water \u2014
p325
aVand all the atmosphere that we can breathe, in relation to the volume of the Earth.
p326
aVAnd inside those balls
p327
aVlife, over 3.8 billion years,
p328
aVhas made a lush, livable place for us.
p329
aa(lp330
VAnd we are in a long, long line
p331
aVof organisms
p332
aVto come to this planet and ask ourselves,
p333
aV"How can we live here gracefully over the long haul?"
p334
aVHow can we do what life has learned to do?
p335
aVWhich is to create conditions conducive to life.
p336
aVNow in order to do this, the design challenge
p337
aVof our century, I think,
p338
aVwe need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses,
p339
aVand to somehow meet them again.
p340
aa(lp341
VOne of the big ideas, one of the big projects
p342
aVI've been honored to work on
p343
aVis a new website. And I would encourage you all to please go to it.
p344
aVIt's called AskNature.org.
p345
aVAnd what we're trying to do, in a TEDesque way,
p346
aVis to organize all biological information
p347
aVby design and engineering function.
p348
aa(lp349
VAnd we're working with EOL, Encyclopedia of Life,
p350
aVEd Wilson's TED wish.
p351
aVAnd he's gathering all biological information
p352
aVon one website.
p353
aVAnd the scientists who are contributing to EOL are answering a question,
p354
aV"What can we learn from this organism?"
p355
aVAnd that information will go into AskNature.org.
p356
aVAnd hopefully, any inventor, anywhere in the world,
p357
aVwill be able, in the moment of creation,
p358
aVto type in, "How does nature remove salt from water?"
p359
aVAnd up will come mangroves, and sea turtles
p360
aVand your own kidneys.
p361
aa(lp362
VAnd we'll begin to
p363
aVbe able to
p364
aVdo as Cody does,
p365
aVand actually be in touch
p366
aVwith these incredible models,
p367
aVthese elders that have been here
p368
aVfar, far longer than we have.
p369
aVAnd hopefully, with their help,
p370
aVwe'll learn how to live on this Earth,
p371
aVand on this home that is ours, but not ours alone.
p372
aVThank you very much.
