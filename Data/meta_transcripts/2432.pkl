VFood crisis.
p4
aVIt's in the news every day.
p5
aVBut what is it?
p6
aa(lp7
VSome places in the world it's too little food,
p8
aVmaybe too much.
p9
aVOther places, GMO is saving the world.
p10
aVMaybe GMO is the problem?
p11
aVToo much agricultural runoff creating bad oceans, toxic oceans,
p12
aVattenuation of nutrition.
p13
aVThey go on and on.
p14
aVAnd I find the current climate of this discussion
p15
aVincredibly disempowering.
p16
aVSo how do we bring that to something that we understand?
p17
aa(lp18
VHow is this apple food crisis?
p19
aVYou've all eaten an apple in the last week, I'm sure.
p20
aVHow old do you think it was from when it was picked?
p21
aVTwo weeks?
p22
aVTwo months?
p23
aVEleven months \u2014
p24
aVthe average age of an apple in a grocery store in the United States.
p25
aVAnd I don't expect it to be much different in Europe
p26
aVor anywhere else in the world.
p27
aVWe pick them,
p28
aVwe put them in cold storage,
p29
aVwe gas the cold storage \u2014
p30
aVthere's actually documented proof
p31
aVof workers trying to go into these environments
p32
aVto retrieve an apple,
p33
aVand dying,
p34
aVbecause the atmosphere
p35
aVthat they slow down the process of the apple with is also toxic to humans.
p36
aa(lp37
VHow is it that none of you knew this?
p38
aVWhy didn't I know this?
p39
aVNinety percent of the quality of that apple \u2014
p40
aVall of the antioxidants \u2014 are gone by the time we get it.
p41
aVIt's basically a little ball of sugar.
p42
aVHow did we get so information poor
p43
aVand how can we do better?
p44
aa(lp45
VI think what's missing is a platform.
p46
aVI know platforms \u2014 I know computers,
p47
aVthey put me on the Internet when I was young.
p48
aVI did very weird things \u2014
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
Von this platform.
p53
aVBut I met people, and I could express myself.
p54
aa(lp55
VHow do you express yourself in food?
p56
aVIf we had a platform,
p57
aVwe might feel empowered to question: What if?
p58
aVFor me, I questioned:
p59
aVWhat if climate was democratic?
p60
aVSo, this is a map of climate in the world.
p61
aVThe most productive areas in green, the least productive in red.
p62
aVThey shift and they change,
p63
aVand Californian farmers now become Mexican farmers.
p64
aVChina picks up land in Brazil to grow better food,
p65
aVand we're a slave to climate.
p66
aVWhat if each country had its own productive climate?
p67
aVWhat would that change about how we live?
p68
aVWhat would that change about quality of life and nutrition?
p69
aa(lp70
VThe last generation's problem was, we need more food
p71
aVand we need it cheap.
p72
aVWelcome to your global farm.
p73
aVWe built a huge analog farm.
p74
aVAll these traces \u2014
p75
aVthese are cars, planes, trains and automobiles.
p76
aVIt's a miracle that we feed seven billion people
p77
aVwith just a few of us involved in the production of food.
p78
aa(lp79
VWhat if ...
p80
aVwe built a digital farm?
p81
aVA digital world farm.
p82
aVWhat if you could take this apple,
p83
aVdigitize it somehow,
p84
aVsend it through particles in the air
p85
aVand reconstitute it on the other side?
p86
aVWhat if?
p87
aa(lp88
VGoing through some of these quotes,
p89
aVyou know, they inspire me to do what I do.
p90
aa(lp91
VFirst one:
p92
aa(lp93
V["Japanese farming has no youth, no water, no land and no future."]
p94
aa(lp95
VThat's what I landed to the day that I went to Minamisanriku,
p96
aVone stop south of Fukushima,
p97
aVafter the disaster.
p98
aVThe kids have headed to Sendai and Tokyo,
p99
aVthe land is contaminated,
p100
aVthey already import 70 percent of their own food.
p101
aVBut it's not unique to Japan.
p102
aVTwo percent of the American population is involved in farming.
p103
aVWhat good answer comes from two percent of any population?
p104
aVAs we go around the world,
p105
aV50 percent of the African population is under 18.
p106
aVEighty percent don't want to be farmers.
p107
aVFarming is hard.
p108
aVThe life of a small-shareholder farmer is miserable.
p109
aVThey go into the city.
p110
aVIn India:
p111
aVfarmers' families not being able to have basic access to utilities,
p112
aVmore farmer suicides this year and the previous 10 before that.
p113
aVIt's uncomfortable to talk about.
p114
aVWhere are they going?
p115
aVInto the city.
p116
aVNo young people, and everyone's headed in.
p117
aVSo how do we build this platform that inspires the youth?
p118
aa(lp119
VWelcome to the new tractor.
p120
aVThis is my combine.
p121
aVA number of years ago now,
p122
aVI went to Bed Bath and Beyond and Home Depot
p123
aVand I started hacking.
p124
aVAnd I built silly things
p125
aVand I made plants dance
p126
aVand I attached them to my computer
p127
aVand I killed them all \u2014
p128
aVa lot.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VI eventually got them to survive.
p133
aVAnd I created one of the most intimate relationships
p134
aVI've ever had in my life,
p135
aVbecause I was learning the language of plants.
p136
aVI wanted to make it bigger.
p137
aVThey said, "Knock yourself out, kid!
p138
aVHere's an old electronics room that nobody wants.
p139
aVWhat can you do?"
p140
aa(lp141
VWith my team, we built a farm inside of the media lab,
p142
aVa place historically known not for anything about biology
p143
aVbut everything about digital life.
p144
aVInside of these 60 square feet,
p145
aVwe produced enough food to feed about 300 people once a month \u2014
p146
aVnot a lot of food.
p147
aVAnd there's a lot of interesting technology in there.
p148
aVBut the most interesting thing?
p149
aVBeautiful, white roots,
p150
aVdeep, green colors
p151
aVand a monthly harvest.
p152
aVIs this a new cafeteria?
p153
aVIs this a new retail experience?
p154
aVIs this a new grocery store?
p155
aVI can tell you one thing for sure:
p156
aVthis is the first time
p157
aVanybody in the media lab ripped the roots off of anything.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VWe get our salad in bags;
p162
aVthere's nothing wrong with that.
p163
aVBut what happens
p164
aVwhen you have an image-based processing expert,
p165
aVa data scientist,
p166
aVa roboticist,
p167
aVripping roots off and thinking,
p168
aV"Huh. I know something about \u2014
p169
aVI could make this happen, I want to try."
p170
aa(lp171
VIn that process we would bring the plants out
p172
aVand we would take some back to the lab,
p173
aVbecause if you grew it, you don't throw it away;
p174
aVit's kind of precious to you.
p175
aVI have this weird tongue now,
p176
aVbecause I'm afraid to let anybody eat anything until I've eaten it first,
p177
aVbecause I want it to be good.
p178
aVSo I eat lettuce every day
p179
aVand I can tell the pH of a lettuce within .1.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VI'm like, "No, that's 6.1 \u2014 no, no, you can't eat it today."
p184
aa(lp185
V(Applause)
p186
aa(lp187
VThis lettuce that day was hyper sweet.
p188
aVIt was hyper sweet because the plant had been stressed
p189
aVand it created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself:
p190
aV"I'm not going to die!"
p191
aVAnd the plants not-going-to-die, taste sweet to me.
p192
aVTechnologists falling backwards into plant physiology.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo we thought other people needed to be able to try this.
p195
aVWe want to see what people can create,
p196
aVso we conceived of a lab that could be shipped anywhere.
p197
aVAnd then we built it.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo on the facade of the media lab is my lab,
p200
aVthat has about 30 points of sensing per plant.
p201
aVIf you know about the genome or genetics,
p202
aVthis is the phenome, right?
p203
aVThe phenomena.
p204
aVWhen you say, "I like the strawberries from Mexico,"
p205
aVyou really like the strawberries from the climate
p206
aVthat produced the expression that you like.
p207
aVSo if you're coding climate \u2014
p208
aVthis much CO2, this much O2 creates a recipe \u2014 you're coding
p209
aVthe expression of that plant, the nutrition of that plant,
p210
aVthe size of that plant, the shape, the color, the texture.
p211
aVWe need data,
p212
aVso we put a bunch of sensors in there
p213
aVto tell us what's going on.
p214
aa(lp215
VIf you think of your houseplants,
p216
aVand you look at your houseplant
p217
aVand you're super sad, because you're like,
p218
aV"Why are you dying? Won't you talk to me?"
p219
aa(lp220
V(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
VFarmers develop the most beautiful fortune-telling eyes
p223
aVby the time they're in their late 60s and 70s.
p224
aVThey can tell you when you see that plant dying
p225
aVthat it's a nitrogen deficiency, a calcium deficiency
p226
aVor it needs more humidity.
p227
aVThose beautiful eyes are not being passed down.
p228
aa(lp229
VThese are eyes in the cloud of a farmer.
p230
aVWe trend those data points over time.
p231
aVWe correlate those data points to individual plants.
p232
aVThese are all the broccoli in my lab that day, by IP address.
p233
aa(lp234
V(Laughter)
p235
aa(lp236
VWe have IP-addressable broccoli.
p237
aa(lp238
V(Applause)
p239
aa(lp240
VSo if that's not weird enough,
p241
aVyou can click one and you get a plant profile.
p242
aVAnd what this tells you is downloadable progress on that plant,
p243
aVbut not like you'd think,
p244
aVit's not just when it's ready.
p245
aVWhen does it achieve the nutrition that I need?
p246
aVWhen does it achieve the taste that I desire?
p247
aVIs it getting too much water?
p248
aVIs it getting too much sun?
p249
aVAlerts.
p250
aVIt can talk to me, it's conversant,
p251
aVwe have a language.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
V(Applause)
p256
aa(lp257
VI think of that as the first user on the plant Facebook, right?
p258
aVThat's a plant profile
p259
aVand that plant will start making friends.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd I mean it \u2014 it will make friends with other plants
p264
aVthat use less nitrogen, more phosphorus,
p265
aVless potassium.
p266
aVWe're going to learn about a complexity
p267
aVthat we can only guess at now.
p268
aVAnd they may not friend us back \u2014 I don't know, they might friend us back,
p269
aVit depends on how we act.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo this is my lab now.
p272
aVIt's a little bit more systematized,
p273
aVmy background is designing data centers in hospitals of all things,
p274
aVso I know a little bit about creating a controlled environment.
p275
aa(lp276
VAnd so \u2014
p277
aVinside of this environment,
p278
aVwe're experimenting with all kinds of things.
p279
aVThis process, aeroponics, was developed by NASA for Mir Space Station
p280
aVfor reducing the amount of water they send into space.
p281
aVWhat it really does is give the plant exactly what it wants:
p282
aVwater, minerals and oxygen.
p283
aVRoots are not that complicated,
p284
aVso when you give them that, you get this amazing expression.
p285
aVIt's like the plant has two hearts.
p286
aVAnd because it has two hearts,
p287
aVit grows four or five times faster.
p288
aVIt's a perfect world.
p289
aVWe've gone a long way into technology and seed for an adverse world
p290
aVand we're going to continue to do that,
p291
aVbut we're going to have a new tool, too,
p292
aVwhich is perfect world.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo we've grown all kinds of things.
p295
aVThese tomatoes hadn't been in commercial production for 150 years.
p296
aVDo you know that we have rare and ancient seed banks?
p297
aVBanks of seed.
p298
aVIt's amazing.
p299
aVThey have germplasm alive and things that you've never eaten.
p300
aVI am the only person in this room that's eaten that kind of tomato.
p301
aVProblem is it was a sauce tomato and we don't know how to cook,
p302
aVso we ate a sauce tomato, which is not that great.
p303
aVBut we've done things with protein \u2014 we've grown all kinds of things.
p304
aVWe've grown humans \u2014
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VWell maybe you could, but we didn't.
p309
aa(lp310
VBut what we realized is,
p311
aVthe tool was too big, it was too expensive.
p312
aVI was starting to put them around the world
p313
aVand they were about 100,000 dollars.
p314
aVFinding somebody with 100 grand in their back pocket isn't easy,
p315
aVso we wanted to make a small one.
p316
aa(lp317
VThis project was actually one of my student's \u2014
p318
aVmechanical engineering undergraduate, Camille.
p319
aVSo Camille and I and my team,
p320
aVwe iterated all summer,
p321
aVhow to make it cheaper, how to make it work better,
p322
aVhow to make it so other people can make it.
p323
aVThen we dropped them off in schools, seventh through eleventh grade.
p324
aVAnd if you want to be humbled, try to teach a kid something.
p325
aa(lp326
VSo I went into this school and I said,
p327
aV"Set it to 65 percent humidity."
p328
aa(lp329
VThe seventh grader said, "What's humidity?"
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd I said, "Oh, it's water in air."
p332
aa(lp333
VHe said, "There's no water in air, you're an idiot."
p334
aa(lp335
V(Laughter)
p336
aa(lp337
VAnd I was like, "Alright, don't trust me.
p338
aVActually \u2014 don't trust me, right?
p339
aVSet it to 100.
p340
aVHe sets it to 100 and what happens?
p341
aVIt starts to condense, make a fog and eventually drip.
p342
aa(lp343
VAnd he says, "Oh. Humidity is rain.
p344
aVWhy didn't you just tell me that?"
p345
aa(lp346
V(Laughter)
p347
aa(lp348
VWe've created an interface for this that's much like a game.
p349
aVThey have a 3D environment,
p350
aVthey can log into it anywhere in the world
p351
aVon their smartphone, on their tablet.
p352
aVThey have different parts of the bots \u2014 the physical, the sensors.
p353
aVThey select recipes that have been created by other kids
p354
aVanywhere in the world.
p355
aVThey select and activate that recipe, they plant a seedling.
p356
aVWhile it's growing, they make changes.
p357
aVThey're like, "Why does a plant need CO2 anyway? Isn't CO2 bad?
p358
aVIt kills people."
p359
aVCrank up CO2, plant dies.
p360
aVOr crank down CO2, plant does very well.
p361
aVHarvest plant,
p362
aVand you've created a new digital recipe.
p363
aa(lp364
VIt's an iterative design and development
p365
aVand exploration process.
p366
aVThey can download, then,
p367
aVall of the data about that new plant that they developed
p368
aVor the new digital recipe and what did it do \u2014
p369
aVwas it better or was it worse?
p370
aVImagine these as little cores of processing.
p371
aVWe're going to learn so much.
p372
aa(lp373
VHere's one of the food computers, as we call them,
p374
aVin a school in three weeks' time.
p375
aVThis is three weeks of growth.
p376
aVBut more importantly,
p377
aVit was the first time that this kid ever thought he could be a farmer \u2014
p378
aVor that he would want to be a farmer.
p379
aa(lp380
VSo, we've open-sourced all of this.
p381
aVIt's all online; go home, try to build your first food computer.
p382
aVIt's going to be difficult \u2014 I'm just telling you.
p383
aVWe're in the beginning, but it's all there.
p384
aVIt's very important to me that this is easily accessible.
p385
aVWe're going to keep making it more so.
p386
aa(lp387
VThese are farmers,
p388
aVelectrical engineer, mechanical engineer,
p389
aVenvironmental engineer, computer scientist,
p390
aVplant scientist, economist, urban planners.
p391
aVOn one platform, doing what they're good at.
p392
aVBut we got a little too big.
p393
aa(lp394
VThis is my new facility that I'm just starting.
p395
aVThis warehouse could be anywhere.
p396
aVThat's why I chose it.
p397
aVAnd inside of this warehouse
p398
aVwe're going to build something kind of like this.
p399
aVThese exist right now.
p400
aVTake a look at it.
p401
aVThese exist, too.
p402
aVOne grows greens,
p403
aVone grows Ebola vaccine.
p404
aVPretty amazing that plants and this DARPA Grand Challenge winner
p405
aVis one of the reasons we're getting ahead of Ebola.
p406
aVThe plants are producing the protein that's Ebola resistant.
p407
aVSo pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals,
p408
aVall they way down to lettuce.
p409
aa(lp410
VBut these two things look nothing alike,
p411
aVand that's where I am with my field.
p412
aVEverything is different.
p413
aVWe're in that weird "We're alright" stage
p414
aVand it's like, "Here's my black box \u2014"
p415
aV"No, buy mine."
p416
aV"No, no, no \u2014 I've got intellectual property that's totally valuable.
p417
aVDon't buy his, buy mine."
p418
aa(lp419
VAnd the reality is, we're just at the beginning,
p420
aVin a time when society is shifting, too.
p421
aVWhen we ask for more, cheaper food,
p422
aVwe're now asking for better, environmentally friendly food.
p423
aVAnd when you have McDonald's advertising what's in the Chicken McNugget,
p424
aVthe most mysterious food item of all time \u2014
p425
aVthey are now basing their marketing plan on that \u2014
p426
aVeverything is changing.
p427
aa(lp428
VSo into the world now.
p429
aVPersonal food computers,
p430
aVfood servers
p431
aVand food data centers
p432
aVrun on the open phenome.
p433
aVThink open genome, but we're going to put little climate recipes,
p434
aVlike Wikipedia,
p435
aVthat you can pull down, actuate and grow.
p436
aa(lp437
VWhat does this look like in a world?
p438
aVYou remember the world connected by strings?
p439
aVWe start having beacons.
p440
aVWe start sending information about food,
p441
aVrather than sending food.
p442
aVThis is not just my fantasy,
p443
aVthis is where we're already deploying.
p444
aVFood computers, food servers,
p445
aVsoon-to-be food data centers,
p446
aVconnecting people together to share information.
p447
aa(lp448
VThe future of food is not about fighting over what's wrong with this.
p449
aVWe know what's wrong with this.
p450
aVThe future of food is about networking the next one billion farmers
p451
aVand empowering them with a platform
p452
aVto ask and answer the question,
p453
aV"What if?"
p454
aa(lp455
VThank you.
