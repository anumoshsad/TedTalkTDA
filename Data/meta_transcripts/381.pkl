VWhen I first arrived in beautiful Zimbabwe,
p4
aVit was difficult to understand that 35 percent of the population
p5
aVis HIV positive.
p6
aVIt really wasn't until I was invited to the homes of people
p7
aVthat I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic.
p8
aVFor instance, this is Herbert with his grandmother.
p9
aVWhen I first met him, he was sitting on his grandmother's lap.
p10
aVHe has been orphaned, as both of his parents died of AIDS,
p11
aVand his grandmother took care of him until he too died of AIDS.
p12
aVHe liked to sit on her lap
p13
aVbecause he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed.
p14
aVWhen she got up to make tea, she placed him in my own lap
p15
aVand I had never felt a child that was that emaciated.
p16
aVBefore I left, I actually asked him if I could get him something.
p17
aVI thought he would ask for a toy, or candy,
p18
aVand he asked me for slippers,
p19
aVbecause he said that his feet were cold.

VThis is Joyce who's \u2014 in this picture \u2014 21.
p22
aVSingle mother, HIV positive.
p23
aVI photographed her before and after
p24
aVthe birth of her beautiful baby girl, Issa.
p25
aVAnd I was last week walking on Lafayette Street in Manhattan
p26
aVand got a call from a woman who I didn't know,
p27
aVbut she called to tell me that Joyce had passed away
p28
aVat the age of 23.
p29
aVJoyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter,
p30
aVlike so many other Zimbabwean children
p31
aVwho've been orphaned by the epidemic.
p32
aVSo a few of the stories.
p33
aVWith every picture,
p34
aVthere are individuals who have full lives
p35
aVand stories that deserve to be told.
p36
aVAll these pictures are from Zimbabwe.

VKA: Actually, I was working at the time, doing production
p46
aVfor a fashion photographer.
p47
aVAnd I was constantly reading the New York Times,
p48
aVand stunned by the statistics, the numbers.
p49
aVIt was just frightening.
p50
aVSo I quit my job
p51
aVand decided that that's the subject that I wanted to tackle.
p52
aVAnd I first actually went to Botswana, where I spent a month \u2014
p53
aVthis is in December 2000 \u2014
p54
aVthen went to Zimbabwe for a month and a half,
p55
