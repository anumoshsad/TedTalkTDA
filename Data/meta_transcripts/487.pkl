VI want to talk to you today a little bit
p4
aVabout predictable irrationality.
p5
aVAnd my interest in irrational behavior
p6
aVstarted many years ago in the hospital.
p7
aVI was burned very badly.
p8
aVAnd if you spend a lot of time in hospital,
p9
aVyou'll see a lot of types of irrationalities.
p10
aVAnd the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department
p11
aVwas the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me.
p12
aVNow, you must have all taken a Band-Aid off at some point,
p13
aVand you must have wondered what's the right approach.
p14
aVDo you rip it off quickly \u2014 short duration but high intensity \u2014
p15
aVor do you take your Band-Aid off slowly \u2014
p16
aVyou take a long time, but each second is not as painful \u2014
p17
aVwhich one of those is the right approach?
p18
aa(lp19
VThe nurses in my department thought that the right approach
p20
aVwas the ripping one, so they would grab hold and they would rip,
p21
aVand they would grab hold and they would rip.
p22
aVAnd because I had 70 percent of my body burned, it would take about an hour.
p23
aVAnd as you can imagine,
p24
aVI hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity.
p25
aVAnd I would try to reason with them and say,
p26
aV"Why don't we try something else?
p27
aVWhy don't we take it a little longer \u2014
p28
aVmaybe two hours instead of an hour \u2014 and have less of this intensity?"
p29
aVAnd the nurses told me two things.
p30
aVThey told me that they had the right model of the patient \u2014
p31
aVthat they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain \u2014
p32
aVand they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean
p33
aVto make suggestions or to interfere or ...
p34
aVThis is not just in Hebrew, by the way.
p35
aVIt's in every language I've had experience with so far.
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd, you know, there's not much \u2014 there wasn't much I could do,
p38
aVand they kept on doing what they were doing.
p39
aVAnd about three years later, when I left the hospital,
p40
aVI started studying at the university.
p41
aVAnd one of the most interesting lessons I learned
p42
aVwas that there is an experimental method
p43
aVthat if you have a question you can create a replica of this question
p44
aVin some abstract way, and you can try to examine this question,
p45
aVmaybe learn something about the world.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo that's what I did.
p48
aVI was still interested
p49
aVin this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients.
p50
aVSo originally I didn't have much money,
p51
aVso I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vice.
p52
aVAnd I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it,
p53
aVand I would crunch it a little bit.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd I would crunch it for long periods and short periods,
p58
aVand pain that went up and pain that went down,
p59
aVand with breaks and without breaks \u2014 all kinds of versions of pain.
p60
aVAnd when I finished hurting people a little bit, I would ask them,
p61
aVso, how painful was this? Or, how painful was this?
p62
aVOr, if you had to choose between the last two,
p63
aVwhich one would you choose?
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VI kept on doing this for a while.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd then, like all good academic projects, I got more funding.
p72
aVI moved to sounds, electrical shocks \u2014
p73
aVI even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain.
p74
aa(lp75
VBut at the end of this process,
p76
aVwhat I learned was that the nurses were wrong.
p77
aVHere were wonderful people with good intentions
p78
aVand plenty of experience, and nevertheless
p79
aVthey were getting things wrong predictably all the time.
p80
aVIt turns out that because we don't encode duration
p81
aVin the way that we encode intensity,
p82
aVI would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer
p83
aVand the intensity was lower.
p84
aVIt turns out it would have been better to start with my face,
p85
aVwhich was much more painful, and move toward my legs,
p86
aVgiving me a trend of improvement over time \u2014
p87
aVthat would have been also less painful.
p88
aVAnd it also turns out that it would have been good
p89
aVto give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain.
p90
aVAll of these would have been great things to do,
p91
aVand my nurses had no idea.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd from that point on I started thinking,
p94
aVare the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong
p95
aVin this particular decision, or is it a more general case?
p96
aVAnd it turns out it's a more general case \u2014
p97
aVthere's a lot of mistakes we do.
p98
aVAnd I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities,
p99
aVand I want to talk to you about cheating.
p100
aVAnd the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting,
p101
aVbut also it tells us something, I think,
p102
aVabout the stock market situation we're in.
p103
aVSo, my interest in cheating started
p104
aVwhen Enron came on the scene, exploded all of a sudden,
p105
aVand I started thinking about what is happening here.
p106
aVIs it the case that there was kind of
p107
aVa few apples who are capable of doing these things,
p108
aVor are we talking a more endemic situation,
p109
aVthat many people are actually capable of behaving this way?
p110
aa(lp111
VSo, like we usually do, I decided to do a simple experiment.
p112
aVAnd here's how it went.
p113
aVIf you were in the experiment, I would pass you a sheet of paper
p114
aVwith 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve,
p115
aVbut I wouldn't give you enough time.
p116
aVWhen the five minutes were over, I would say,
p117
aV"Pass me the sheets of paper, and I'll pay you a dollar per question."
p118
aVPeople did this. I would pay people four dollars for their task \u2014
p119
aVon average people would solve four problems.
p120
aVOther people I would tempt to cheat.
p121
aVI would pass their sheet of paper.
p122
aVWhen the five minutes were over, I would say,
p123
aV"Please shred the piece of paper.
p124
aVPut the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack,
p125
aVand tell me how many questions you got correctly."
p126
aVPeople now solved seven questions on average.
p127
aVNow, it wasn't as if there was a few bad apples \u2014
p128
aVa few people cheated a lot.
p129
aVInstead, what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow, in economic theory,
p132
aVcheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis.
p133
aVYou say, what's the probability of being caught?
p134
aVHow much do I stand to gain from cheating?
p135
aVAnd how much punishment would I get if I get caught?
p136
aVAnd you weigh these options out \u2014
p137
aVyou do the simple cost-benefit analysis,
p138
aVand you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not.
p139
aVSo, we try to test this.
p140
aVFor some people, we varied how much money they could get away with \u2014
p141
aVhow much money they could steal.
p142
aVWe paid them 10 cents per correct question, 50 cents,
p143
aVa dollar, five dollars, 10 dollars per correct question.
p144
aa(lp145
VYou would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases,
p146
aVpeople would cheat more, but in fact it wasn't the case.
p147
aVWe got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit.
p148
aVWhat about the probability of being caught?
p149
aVSome people shredded half the sheet of paper,
p150
aVso there was some evidence left.
p151
aVSome people shredded the whole sheet of paper.
p152
aVSome people shredded everything, went out of the room,
p153
aVand paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars.
p154
aVYou would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down,
p155
aVpeople would cheat more, but again, this was not the case.
p156
aVAgain, a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit,
p157
aVand they were insensitive to these economic incentives.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo we said, "If people are not sensitive
p160
aVto the economic rational theory explanations, to these forces,
p161
aVwhat could be going on?"
p162
aVAnd we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces.
p163
aVAt one hand, we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror
p164
aVand feel good about ourselves, so we don't want to cheat.
p165
aVOn the other hand, we can cheat a little bit,
p166
aVand still feel good about ourselves.
p167
aVSo, maybe what is happening is that
p168
aVthere's a level of cheating we can't go over,
p169
aVbut we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree,
p170
aVas long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves.
p171
aVWe call this like a personal fudge factor.
p172
aa(lp173
VNow, how would you test a personal fudge factor?
p174
aVInitially we said, what can we do to shrink the fudge factor?
p175
aVSo, we got people to the lab, and we said,
p176
aV"We have two tasks for you today."
p177
aVFirst, we asked half the people
p178
aVto recall either 10 books they read in high school,
p179
aVor to recall The Ten Commandments,
p180
aVand then we tempted them with cheating.
p181
aVTurns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments \u2014
p182
aVand in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments \u2014
p183
aVbut those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments,
p184
aVgiven the opportunity to cheat, did not cheat at all.
p185
aVIt wasn't that the more religious people \u2014
p186
aVthe people who remembered more of the Commandments \u2014 cheated less,
p187
aVand the less religious people \u2014
p188
aVthe people who couldn't remember almost any Commandments \u2014
p189
aVcheated more.
p190
aVThe moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments,
p191
aVthey stopped cheating.
p192
aVIn fact, even when we gave self-declared atheists
p193
aVthe task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat,
p194
aVthey don't cheat at all.
p195
aVNow, Ten Commandments is something that is hard
p196
aVto bring into the education system, so we said,
p197
aV"Why don't we get people to sign the honor code?"
p198
aVSo, we got people to sign,
p199
aV"I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT Honor Code."
p200
aVThen they shredded it. No cheating whatsoever.
p201
aVAnd this is particularly interesting,
p202
aVbecause MIT doesn't have an honor code.
p203
aV(Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VSo, all this was about decreasing the fudge factor.
p206
aVWhat about increasing the fudge factor?
p207
aVThe first experiment \u2014 I walked around MIT
p208
aVand I distributed six-packs of Cokes in the refrigerators \u2014
p209
aVthese were common refrigerators for the undergrads.
p210
aVAnd I came back to measure what we technically call
p211
aVthe half-lifetime of Coke \u2014 how long does it last in the refrigerators?
p212
aVAs you can expect it doesn't last very long; people take it.
p213
aVIn contrast, I took a plate with six one-dollar bills,
p214
aVand I left those plates in the same refrigerators.
p215
aVNo bill ever disappeared.
p216
aa(lp217
VNow, this is not a good social science experiment,
p218
aVso to do it better I did the same experiment
p219
aVas I described to you before.
p220
aVA third of the people we passed the sheet, they gave it back to us.
p221
aVA third of the people we passed it to, they shredded it,
p222
aVthey came to us and said,
p223
aV"Mr. Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X dollars."
p224
aVA third of the people, when they finished shredding the piece of paper,
p225
aVthey came to us and said,
p226
aV"Mr Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X tokens."
p227
aVWe did not pay them with dollars; we paid them with something else.
p228
aVAnd then they took the something else, they walked 12 feet to the side,
p229
aVand exchanged it for dollars.
p230
aa(lp231
VThink about the following intuition.
p232
aVHow bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home,
p233
aVcompared to how bad would you feel
p234
aVabout taking 10 cents from a petty cash box?
p235
aVThese things feel very differently.
p236
aVWould being a step removed from cash for a few seconds
p237
aVby being paid by token make a difference?
p238
aVOur subjects doubled their cheating.
p239
aVI'll tell you what I think
p240
aVabout this and the stock market in a minute.
p241
aVBut this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet,
p242
aVbecause in Enron, there's also a social element.
p243
aVPeople see each other behaving.
p244
aVIn fact, every day when we open the news
p245
aVwe see examples of people cheating.
p246
aVWhat does this cause us?
p247
aa(lp248
VSo, we did another experiment.
p249
aVWe got a big group of students to be in the experiment,
p250
aVand we prepaid them.
p251
aVSo everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment,
p252
aVand we told them that at the end, we asked them
p253
aVto pay us back the money they didn't make. OK?
p254
aVThe same thing happens.
p255
aVWhen we give people the opportunity to cheat, they cheat.
p256
aVThey cheat just by a little bit, all the same.
p257
aVBut in this experiment we also hired an acting student.
p258
aVThis acting student stood up after 30 seconds, and said,
p259
aV"I solved everything. What do I do now?"
p260
aVAnd the experimenter said, "If you've finished everything, go home.
p261
aVThat's it. The task is finished."
p262
aVSo, now we had a student \u2014 an acting student \u2014
p263
aVthat was a part of the group.
p264
aVNobody knew it was an actor.
p265
aVAnd they clearly cheated in a very, very serious way.
p266
aVWhat would happen to the other people in the group?
p267
aVWill they cheat more, or will they cheat less?
p268
aa(lp269
VHere is what happens.
p270
aVIt turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they're wearing.
p271
aVHere is the thing.
p272
aVWe ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh.
p273
aVAnd at Pittsburgh there are two big universities,
p274
aVCarnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh.
p275
aVAll of the subjects sitting in the experiment
p276
aVwere Carnegie Mellon students.
p277
aVWhen the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student \u2014
p278
aVhe was actually a Carnegie Mellon student \u2014
p279
aVbut he was a part of their group, cheating went up.
p280
aVBut when he actually had a University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt,
p281
aVcheating went down.
p282
aa(lp283
V(Laughter)
p284
aa(lp285
VNow, this is important, because remember,
p286
aVwhen the moment the student stood up,
p287
aVit made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating,
p288
aVbecause the experimenter said,
p289
aV"You've finished everything. Go home," and they went with the money.
p290
aVSo it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again.
p291
aVIt was about the norms for cheating.
p292
aVIf somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating,
p293
aVwe feel it's more appropriate, as a group, to behave this way.
p294
aVBut if it's somebody from another group, these terrible people \u2014
p295
aVI mean, not terrible in this \u2014
p296
aVbut somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with,
p297
aVfrom another university, another group,
p298
aVall of a sudden people's awareness of honesty goes up \u2014
p299
aVa little bit like The Ten Commandments experiment \u2014
p300
aVand people cheat even less.
p301
aa(lp302
VSo, what have we learned from this about cheating?
p303
aVWe've learned that a lot of people can cheat.
p304
aVThey cheat just by a little bit.
p305
aVWhen we remind people about their morality, they cheat less.
p306
aVWhen we get bigger distance from cheating,
p307
aVfrom the object of money, for example, people cheat more.
p308
aVAnd when we see cheating around us,
p309
aVparticularly if it's a part of our in-group, cheating goes up.
p310
aVNow, if we think about this in terms of the stock market,
p311
aVthink about what happens.
p312
aVWhat happens in a situation when you create something
p313
aVwhere you pay people a lot of money
p314
aVto see reality in a slightly distorted way?
p315
aVWould they not be able to see it this way?
p316
aVOf course they would.
p317
aVWhat happens when you do other things,
p318
aVlike you remove things from money?
p319
aVYou call them stock, or stock options, derivatives,
p320
aVmortgage-backed securities.
p321
aVCould it be that with those more distant things,
p322
aVit's not a token for one second,
p323
aVit's something that is many steps removed from money
p324
aVfor a much longer time \u2014 could it be that people will cheat even more?
p325
aVAnd what happens to the social environment
p326
aVwhen people see other people behave around them?
p327
aVI think all of those forces worked in a very bad way
p328
aVin the stock market.
p329
aa(lp330
VMore generally, I want to tell you something
p331
aVabout behavioral economics.
p332
aVWe have many intuitions in our life,
p333
aVand the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong.
p334
aVThe question is, are we going to test those intuitions?
p335
aVWe can think about how we're going to test this intuition
p336
aVin our private life, in our business life,
p337
aVand most particularly when it goes to policy,
p338
aVwhen we think about things like No Child Left Behind,
p339
aVwhen you create new stock markets, when you create other policies \u2014
p340
aVtaxation, health care and so on.
p341
aVAnd the difficulty of testing our intuition
p342
aVwas the big lesson I learned
p343
aVwhen I went back to the nurses to talk to them.
p344
aa(lp345
VSo I went back to talk to them
p346
aVand tell them what I found out about removing bandages.
p347
aVAnd I learned two interesting things.
p348
aVOne was that my favorite nurse, Ettie,
p349
aVtold me that I did not take her pain into consideration.
p350
aVShe said, "Of course, you know, it was very painful for you.
p351
aVBut think about me as a nurse,
p352
aVtaking, removing the bandages of somebody I liked,
p353
aVand had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time.
p354
aVCreating so much torture was not something that was good for me, too."
p355
aVAnd she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her.
p356
aVBut it was actually more interesting than that, because she said,
p357
aV"I did not think that your intuition was right.
p358
aVI felt my intuition was correct."
p359
aVSo, if you think about all of your intuitions,
p360
aVit's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong.
p361
aVAnd she said, "Given the fact that I thought my intuition was right ..." \u2014
p362
aVshe thought her intuition was right \u2014
p363
aVit was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment
p364
aVto try and check whether she was wrong.
p365
aa(lp366
VBut in fact, this is the situation we're all in all the time.
p367
aVWe have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things \u2014
p368
aVour own ability, how the economy works,
p369
aVhow we should pay school teachers.
p370
aVBut unless we start testing those intuitions,
p371
aVwe're not going to do better.
p372
aVAnd just think about how better my life would have been
p373
aVif these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition,
p374
aVand how everything would have been better
p375
aVif we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions.
p376
