VThe job of uncovering the global food waste scandal
p4
aVstarted for me when I was 15 years old.
p5
aVI bought some pigs. I was living in Sussex.
p6
aVAnd I started to feed them in the most traditional
p7
aVand environmentally friendly way.
p8
aVI went to my school kitchen, and I said,
p9
aV"Give me the scraps that my school friends have turned
p10
aVtheir noses up at."
p11
aVI went to the local baker and took their stale bread.
p12
aVI went to the local greengrocer, and I went to a farmer
p13
aVwho was throwing away potatoes because they were
p14
aVthe wrong shape or size for supermarkets.
p15
aVThis was great. My pigs turned that food waste
p16
aVinto delicious pork. I sold that pork
p17
aVto my school friends' parents, and I made
p18
aVa good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance.
p19
aa(lp20
VBut I noticed that most of the food that I was giving my pigs
p21
aVwas in fact fit for human consumption,
p22
aVand that I was only scratching the surface,
p23
aVand that right the way up the food supply chain,
p24
aVin supermarkets, greengrocers, bakers, in our homes,
p25
aVin factories and farms, we were hemorrhaging out food.
p26
aVSupermarkets didn't even want to talk to me
p27
aVabout how much food they were wasting.
p28
aVI'd been round the back. I'd seen bins full of food
p29
aVbeing locked and then trucked off to landfill sites,
p30
aVand I thought, surely there is something more sensible
p31
aVto do with food than waste it.
p32
aa(lp33
VOne morning, when I was feeding my pigs,
p34
aVI noticed a particularly tasty-looking sun-dried tomato loaf
p35
aVthat used to crop up from time to time.
p36
aVI grabbed hold of it,
p37
aVsat down, and ate my breakfast with my pigs. (Laughter)
p38
aVThat was the first act of what I later learned to call freeganism,
p39
aVreally an exhibition of the injustice of food waste,
p40
aVand the provision of the solution to food waste,
p41
aVwhich is simply to sit down and eat food,
p42
aVrather than throwing it away.
p43
aVThat became, as it were, a way of confronting
p44
aVlarge businesses in the business of wasting food,
p45
aVand exposing, most importantly, to the public,
p46
aVthat when we're talking about food being thrown away,
p47
aVwe're not talking about rotten stuff, we're not talking about
p48
aVstuff that's beyond the pale.
p49
aVWe're talking about good, fresh food that is being wasted
p50
aVon a colossal scale.
p51
aa(lp52
VEventually, I set about writing my book,
p53
aVreally to demonstrate the extent of this problem
p54
aVon a global scale. What this shows is
p55
aVa nation-by-nation breakdown of the likely level
p56
aVof food waste in each country in the world.
p57
aVUnfortunately, empirical data, good, hard stats, don't exist,
p58
aVand therefore to prove my point, I first of all had to find
p59
aVsome proxy way of uncovering
p60
aVhow much food was being wasted.
p61
aVSo I took the food supply of every single country
p62
aVand I compared it to what was actually likely
p63
aVto be being consumed in each country.
p64
aVThat's based on diet intake surveys, it's based on
p65
aVlevels of obesity, it's based on a range of factors
p66
aVthat gives you an approximate guess
p67
aVas to how much food is actually going into people's mouths.
p68
aVThat black line in the middle of that table
p69
aVis the likely level of consumption
p70
aVwith an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste.
p71
aVThere will always be waste. I'm not that unrealistic
p72
aVthat I think we can live in a waste-free world.
p73
aVBut that black line shows what a food supply should be
p74
aVin a country if they allow for a good, stable, secure,
p75
aVnutritional diet for every person in that country.
p76
aVAny dot above that line, and you'll quickly notice that
p77
aVthat includes most countries in the world,
p78
aVrepresents unnecessary surplus, and is likely to reflect
p79
aVlevels of waste in each country.
p80
aa(lp81
VAs a country gets richer, it invests more and more
p82
aVin getting more and more surplus
p83
aVinto its shops and restaurants,
p84
aVand as you can see, most European
p85
aVand North American countries
p86
aVfall between 150 and 200 percent
p87
aVof the nutritional requirements of their populations.
p88
aVSo a country like America has twice as much food
p89
aVon its shop shelves and in its restaurants
p90
aVthan is actually required to feed the American people.
p91
aa(lp92
VBut the thing that really struck me,
p93
aVwhen I plotted all this data, and it was a lot of numbers,
p94
aVwas that you can see how it levels off.
p95
aVCountries rapidly shoot towards that 150 mark,
p96
aVand then they level off, and they don't really go on rising
p97
aVas you might expect.
p98
aVSo I decided to unpack that data a little bit further
p99
aVto see if that was true or false.
p100
aVAnd that's what I came up with.
p101
aVIf you include not just the food that ends up
p102
aVin shops and restaurants, but also the food
p103
aVthat people feed to livestock,
p104
aVthe maize, the soy, the wheat, that humans could eat
p105
aVbut choose to fatten livestock instead to produce
p106
aVincreasing amounts of meat and dairy products,
p107
aVwhat you find is that most rich countries
p108
aVhave between three and four times the amount of food
p109
aVthat their population needs to feed itself.
p110
aVA country like America has four times the amount of food
p111
aVthat it needs.
p112
aa(lp113
VWhen people talk about the need to increase global
p114
aVfood production to feed those nine billion people
p115
aVthat are expected on the planet by 2050,
p116
aVI always think of these graphs.
p117
aVThe fact is, we have an enormous buffer
p118
aVin rich countries between ourselves and hunger.
p119
aVWe've never had such gargantuan surpluses before.
p120
aVIn many ways, this is a great success story
p121
aVof human civilization, of the agricultural surpluses
p122
aVthat we set out to achieve 12,000 years ago.
p123
aVIt is a success story. It has been a success story.
p124
aVBut what we have to recognize now is that we are
p125
aVreaching the ecological limits that our planet can bear,
p126
aVand when we chop down forests, as we are every day,
p127
aVto grow more and more food,
p128
aVwhen we extract water from depleting water reserves,
p129
aVwhen we emit fossil fuel emissions in the quest
p130
aVto grow more and more food,
p131
aVand then we throw away so much of it,
p132
aVwe have to think about what we can start saving.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd yesterday, I went to one of the local supermarkets
p135
aVthat I often visit to
p136
aVinspect, if you like, what they're throwing away.
p137
aVI found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst
p138
aVall the fruit and vegetables and everything else
p139
aVthat was in there.
p140
aVAnd I thought, well this could serve as a symbol for today.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo I want you to imagine that these nine biscuits
p143
aVthat I found in the bin represent the global food supply,
p144
aVokay? We start out with nine.
p145
aVThat's what's in fields around the world every single year.
p146
aVThe first biscuit we're going to lose
p147
aVbefore we even leave the farm.
p148
aVThat's a problem primarily associated with
p149
aVdeveloping work agriculture, whether it's
p150
aVa lack of infrastructure, refrigeration, pasteurization,
p151
aVgrain stores, even basic fruit crates, which means
p152
aVthat food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields.
p153
aVThe next three biscuits are the foods that we decide
p154
aVto feed to livestock, the maize, the wheat and the soya.
p155
aVUnfortunately, our beasts are inefficient animals,
p156
aVand they turn two-thirds of that into feces and heat,
p157
aVso we've lost those two, and we've only kept this one
p158
aVin meat and dairy products.
p159
aVTwo more we're going to throw away directly into bins.
p160
aVThis is what most of us think of when we think
p161
aVof food waste, what ends up in the garbage,
p162
aVwhat ends up in supermarket bins,
p163
aVwhat ends up in restaurant bins. We've lost another two,
p164
aVand we've left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on.
p165
aVThat is not a superlatively efficient use of global resources,
p166
aVespecially when you think of the billion hungry people
p167
aVthat exist already in the world.
p168
aa(lp169
VHaving gone through the data, I then needed
p170
aVto demonstrate where that food ends up.
p171
aVWhere does it end up? We're used to seeing the stuff
p172
aVon our plates, but what about all the stuff
p173
aVthat goes missing in between?
p174
aa(lp175
VSupermarkets are an easy place to start.
p176
aVThis is the result of my hobby,
p177
aVwhich is unofficial bin inspections. (Laughter)
p178
aVStrange you might think, but if we could rely on corporations
p179
aVto tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores,
p180
aVwe wouldn't need to go sneaking around the back,
p181
aVopening up bins and having a look at what's inside.
p182
aVBut this is what you can see more or less on
p183
aVevery street corner in Britain, in Europe, in North America.
p184
aVIt represents a colossal waste of food,
p185
aVbut what I discovered whilst I was writing my book
p186
aVwas that this very evident abundance of waste
p187
aVwas actually the tip of the iceberg.
p188
aVWhen you start going up the supply chain,
p189
aVyou find where the real food waste is happening
p190
aVon a gargantuan scale.
p191
aa(lp192
VCan I have a show of hands
p193
aVif you have a loaf of sliced bread in your house?
p194
aVWho lives in a household where that crust \u2014
p195
aVthat slice at the first and last end of each loaf \u2014
p196
aVwho lives in a household where it does get eaten?
p197
aVOkay, most people, not everyone, but most people,
p198
aVand this is, I'm glad to say, what I see across the world,
p199
aVand yet has anyone seen a supermarket or sandwich shop
p200
aVanywhere in the world that serves sandwiches
p201
aVwith crusts on it? (Laughter)
p202
aVI certainly haven't.
p203
aVSo I kept on thinking, where do those crusts go? (Laughter)
p204
aVThis is the answer, unfortunately:
p205
aV13,000 slices of fresh bread coming out of
p206
aVthis one single factory every single day, day-fresh bread.
p207
aVIn the same year that I visited this factory,
p208
aVI went to Pakistan, where people in 2008 were going hungry
p209
aVas a result of a squeeze on global food supplies.
p210
aVWe contribute to that squeeze
p211
aVby depositing food in bins here in Britain
p212
aVand elsewhere in the world. We take food
p213
aVoff the market shelves that hungry people depend on.
p214
aa(lp215
VGo one step up, and you get to farmers,
p216
aVwho throw away sometimes a third or even more
p217
aVof their harvest because of cosmetic standards.
p218
aVThis farmer, for example, has invested 16,000 pounds
p219
aVin growing spinach, not one leaf of which he harvested,
p220
aVbecause there was a little bit of grass growing in amongst it.
p221
aVPotatoes that are cosmetically imperfect,
p222
aVall going for pigs.
p223
aVParsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications,
p224
aVtomatoes in Tenerife,
p225
aVoranges in Florida,
p226
aVbananas in Ecuador, where I visited last year,
p227
aVall being discarded. This is one day's waste
p228
aVfrom one banana plantation in Ecuador.
p229
aVAll being discarded, perfectly edible,
p230
aVbecause they're the wrong shape or size.
p231
aa(lp232
VIf we do that to fruit and vegetables,
p233
aVyou bet we can do it to animals too.
p234
aVLiver, lungs, heads, tails,
p235
aVkidneys, testicles,
p236
aVall of these things which are traditional,
p237
aVdelicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy
p238
aVgo to waste. Offal consumption has halved
p239
aVin Britain and America in the last 30 years.
p240
aVAs a result, this stuff gets fed to dogs at best,
p241
aVor is incinerated.
p242
aVThis man, in Kashgar, Xinjiang province, in Western China,
p243
aVis serving up his national dish.
p244
aVIt's called sheep's organs.
p245
aVIt's delicious, it's nutritious,
p246
aVand as I learned when I went to Kashgar,
p247
aVit symbolizes their taboo against food waste.
p248
aVI was sitting in a roadside cafe.
p249
aVA chef came to talk to me, I finished my bowl,
p250
aVand halfway through the conversation, he stopped talking
p251
aVand he started frowning into my bowl.
p252
aVI thought, "My goodness, what taboo have I broken?
p253
aVHow have I insulted my host?"
p254
aVHe pointed at three grains of rice
p255
aVat the bottom of my bowl, and he said, "Clean." (Laughter)
p256
aVI thought, "My God, you know, I go around the world
p257
aVtelling people to stop wasting food.
p258
aVThis guy has thrashed me at my own game." (Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VBut it gave me faith. It gave me faith that we, the people,
p261
aVdo have the power to stop this tragic waste of resources
p262
aVif we regard it as socially unacceptable
p263
aVto waste food on a colossal scale,
p264
aVif we make noise about it, tell corporations about it,
p265
aVtell governments we want to see an end to food waste,
p266
aVwe do have the power to bring about that change.
p267
aa(lp268
VFish, 40 to 60 percent of European fish
p269
aVare discarded at sea, they don't even get landed.
p270
aVIn our homes, we've lost touch with food.
p271
aVThis is an experiment I did on three lettuces.
p272
aVWho keeps lettuces in their fridge?
p273
aVMost people. The one on the left
p274
aVwas kept in a fridge for 10 days.
p275
aVThe one in the middle, on my kitchen table. Not much difference.
p276
aVThe one on the right I treated like cut flowers.
p277
aVIt's a living organism, cut the slice off,
p278
aVstuck it in a vase of water,
p279
aVit was all right for another two weeks after this.
p280
aa(lp281
VSome food waste, as I said at the beginning,
p282
aVwill inevitably arise, so the question is,
p283
aVwhat is the best thing to do with it?
p284
aVI answered that question when I was 15.
p285
aVIn fact, humans answered that question 6,000 years ago:
p286
aVWe domesticated pigs
p287
aVto turn food waste back into food.
p288
aVAnd yet, in Europe, that practice has become illegal
p289
aVsince 2001 as a result of the foot-and-mouth outbreak.
p290
aVIt's unscientific. It's unnecessary.
p291
aVIf you cook food for pigs, just as if
p292
aVyou cook food for humans, it is rendered safe.
p293
aVIt's also a massive saving of resources.
p294
aVAt the moment, Europe depends on importing
p295
aVmillions of tons of soy from South America,
p296
aVwhere its production contributes to global warming,
p297
aVto deforestation, to biodiversity loss,
p298
aVto feed livestock here in Europe.
p299
aVAt the same time we throw away millions of tons
p300
aVof food waste which we could and should be feeding them.
p301
aVIf we did that, and fed it to pigs, we would save
p302
aVthat amount of carbon.
p303
aVIf we feed our food waste which is the current
p304
aVgovernment favorite way of getting rid of food waste,
p305
aVto anaerobic digestion, which turns food waste
p306
aVinto gas to produce electricity,
p307
aVyou save a paltry 448 kilograms of carbon dioxide
p308
aVper ton of food waste. It's much better to feed it to pigs.
p309
aVWe knew that during the war. (Laughter)
p310
aa(lp311
VA silver lining: It has kicked off globally,
p312
aVthe quest to tackle food waste.
p313
aVFeeding the 5,000 is an event I first organized in 2009.
p314
aVWe fed 5,000 people all on food that otherwise
p315
aVwould have been wasted.
p316
aVSince then, it's happened again in London,
p317
aVit's happening internationally, and across the country.
p318
aVIt's a way of organizations coming together
p319
aVto celebrate food, to say the best thing to do with food
p320
aVis to eat and enjoy it, and to stop wasting it.
p321
aVFor the sake of the planet we live on,
p322
aVfor the sake of our children,
p323
aVfor the sake of all the other
p324
aVorganisms that share our planet with us,
p325
aVwe are a terrestrial animal, and we depend on our land
p326
aVfor food. At the moment, we are trashing our land
p327
aVto grow food that no one eats.
p328
aVStop wasting food. Thank you very much. (Applause)
