VTen years ago,
p4
aVcomputer vision researchers thought that getting a computer
p5
aVto tell the difference between a cat and a dog
p6
aVwould be almost impossible,
p7
aVeven with the significant advance in the state of artificial intelligence.
p8
aVNow we can do it at a level greater than 99 percent accuracy.
p9
aVThis is called image classification \u2014
p10
aVgive it an image, put a label to that image \u2014
p11
aVand computers know thousands of other categories as well.
p12
aa(lp13
VI'm a graduate student at the University of Washington,
p14
aVand I work on a project called Darknet,
p15
aVwhich is a neural network framework
p16
aVfor training and testing computer vision models.
p17
aVSo let's just see what Darknet thinks
p18
aVof this image that we have.
p19
aVWhen we run our classifier
p20
aVon this image,
p21
aVwe see we don't just get a prediction of dog or cat,
p22
aVwe actually get specific breed predictions.
p23
aVThat's the level of granularity we have now.
p24
aVAnd it's correct.
p25
aVMy dog is in fact a malamute.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo we've made amazing strides in image classification,
p28
aVbut what happens when we run our classifier
p29
aVon an image that looks like this?
p30
aVWell ...
p31
aVWe see that the classifier comes back with a pretty similar prediction.
p32
aVAnd it's correct, there is a malamute in the image,
p33
aVbut just given this label, we don't actually know that much
p34
aVabout what's going on in the image.
p35
aVWe need something more powerful.
p36
aVI work on a problem called object detection,
p37
aVwhere we look at an image and try to find all of the objects,
p38
aVput bounding boxes around them
p39
aVand say what those objects are.
p40
aVSo here's what happens when we run a detector on this image.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow, with this kind of result,
p43
aVwe can do a lot more with our computer vision algorithms.
p44
aVWe see that it knows that there's a cat and a dog.
p45
aVIt knows their relative locations,
p46
aVtheir size.
p47
aVIt may even know some extra information.
p48
aVThere's a book sitting in the background.
p49
aVAnd if you want to build a system on top of computer vision,
p50
aVsay a self-driving vehicle or a robotic system,
p51
aVthis is the kind of information that you want.
p52
aVYou want something so that you can interact with the physical world.
p53
aVNow, when I started working on object detection,
p54
aVit took 20 seconds to process a single image.
p55
aVAnd to get a feel for why speed is so important in this domain,
p56
aVhere's an example of an object detector
p57
aVthat takes two seconds to process an image.
p58
aVSo this is 10 times faster
p59
aVthan the 20-seconds-per-image detector,
p60
aVand you can see that by the time it makes predictions,
p61
aVthe entire state of the world has changed,
p62
aVand this wouldn't be very useful
p63
aVfor an application.
p64
aa(lp65
VIf we speed this up by another factor of 10,
p66
aVthis is a detector running at five frames per second.
p67
aVThis is a lot better,
p68
aVbut for example,
p69
aVif there's any significant movement,
p70
aVI wouldn't want a system like this driving my car.
p71
aa(lp72
VThis is our detection system running in real time on my laptop.
p73
aVSo it smoothly tracks me as I move around the frame,
p74
aVand it's robust to a wide variety of changes in size,
p75
aVpose,
p76
aVforward, backward.
p77
aVThis is great.
p78
aVThis is what we really need
p79
aVif we're going to build systems on top of computer vision.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Applause)
p82
aa(lp83
VSo in just a few years,
p84
aVwe've gone from 20 seconds per image
p85
aVto 20 milliseconds per image, a thousand times faster.
p86
aVHow did we get there?
p87
aVWell, in the past, object detection systems
p88
aVwould take an image like this
p89
aVand split it into a bunch of regions
p90
aVand then run a classifier on each of these regions,
p91
aVand high scores for that classifier
p92
aVwould be considered detections in the image.
p93
aVBut this involved running a classifier thousands of times over an image,
p94
aVthousands of neural network evaluations to produce detection.
p95
aVInstead, we trained a single network to do all of detection for us.
p96
aVIt produces all of the bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously.
p97
aVWith our system, instead of looking at an image thousands of times
p98
aVto produce detection,
p99
aVyou only look once,
p100
aVand that's why we call it the YOLO method of object detection.
p101
aVSo with this speed, we're not just limited to images;
p102
aVwe can process video in real time.
p103
aVAnd now, instead of just seeing that cat and dog,
p104
aVwe can see them move around and interact with each other.
p105
aa(lp106
VThis is a detector that we trained
p107
aVon 80 different classes
p108
aVin Microsoft's COCO dataset.
p109
aVIt has all sorts of things like spoon and fork, bowl,
p110
aVcommon objects like that.
p111
aVIt has a variety of more exotic things:
p112
aVanimals, cars, zebras, giraffes.
p113
aVAnd now we're going to do something fun.
p114
aVWe're just going to go out into the audience
p115
aVand see what kind of things we can detect.
p116
aVDoes anyone want a stuffed animal?
p117
aVThere are some teddy bears out there.
p118
aVAnd we can turn down our threshold for detection a little bit,
p119
aVso we can find more of you guys out in the audience.
p120
aVLet's see if we can get these stop signs.
p121
aVWe find some backpacks.
p122
aVLet's just zoom in a little bit.
p123
aVAnd this is great.
p124
aVAnd all of the processing is happening in real time
p125
aVon the laptop.
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd it's important to remember
p128
aVthat this is a general purpose object detection system,
p129
aVso we can train this for any image domain.
p130
aVThe same code that we use
p131
aVto find stop signs or pedestrians,
p132
aVbicycles in a self-driving vehicle,
p133
aVcan be used to find cancer cells
p134
aVin a tissue biopsy.
p135
aVAnd there are researchers around the globe already using this technology
p136
aVfor advances in things like medicine, robotics.
p137
aVThis morning, I read a paper
p138
aVwhere they were taking a census of animals in Nairobi National Park
p139
aVwith YOLO as part of this detection system.
p140
aVAnd that's because Darknet is open source
p141
aVand in the public domain, free for anyone to use.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Applause)
p144
aa(lp145
VBut we wanted to make detection even more accessible and usable,
p146
aVso through a combination of model optimization,
p147
aVnetwork binarization and approximation,
p148
aVwe actually have object detection running on a phone.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Applause)
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd I'm really excited because now we have a pretty powerful solution
p153
aVto this low-level computer vision problem,
p154
aVand anyone can take it and build something with it.
p155
aVSo now the rest is up to all of you
p156
aVand people around the world with access to this software,
p157
aVand I can't wait to see what people will build with this technology.
p158
aa(lp159
VThank you.
