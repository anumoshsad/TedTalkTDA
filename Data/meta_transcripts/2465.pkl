VI'm here to talk to you today
p4
aVabout a story that we have all been conditioned to believe
p5
aVis not possible.
p6
aVIt's a story about a living, breathing start-up
p7
aVflourishing in an unlikely environment:
p8
aVthe United States government.
p9
aVNow, this start-up is fundamentally beginning to disrupt
p10
aVthe way government does business from the inside out.
p11
aVBut before I get there, let's start with the problem.
p12
aa(lp13
VFor me, the problem begins with a number: 137.
p14
aV137 is the average number of days
p15
aVa veteran has to wait to have benefits processed by the VA.
p16
aV137 days.
p17
aVNow, in order to file that application in the first place,
p18
aVshe has to navigate over 1,000 different websites
p19
aVand over 900 different call-in numbers,
p20
aVall owned and operated by the United States government.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow, we live in times of incredible change.
p23
aVThe private sector is constantly changing
p24
aVand improving itself all the time.
p25
aVFor that matter, it's removing every single inconvenience in my life
p26
aVthat I could possibly think of.
p27
aVI could be sitting on my couch in my apartment,
p28
aVand from my phone, I can order a warm, gluten-free meal
p29
aVthat can arrive at my door in less than 10 minutes.
p30
aVBut meanwhile, a working mother who depends on food stamps
p31
aVto support her family
p32
aVhas to complete an arduous, complicated application
p33
aVwhich she might not even be able to do online.
p34
aVAnd the inability of her to do that same work from her couch means
p35
aVthat she might be having to take days or hours off of work
p36
aVthat she can't spare.
p37
aVAnd this growing dichotomy
p38
aVbetween the beneficiaries of the tech revolution
p39
aVand those it's left behind
p40
aVis one of the greatest challenges of our time \u2014
p41
aa(lp42
V(Applause)
p43
aa(lp44
VBecause government's failure to deliver digital services that work
p45
aVis disproportionately impacting the very people who need it most.
p46
aVIt's impacting the students trying to go to college,
p47
aVthe single mothers trying to get health care,
p48
aVthe veterans coming home from battle.
p49
aVThey can't get what they need when they need it.
p50
aVAnd for these Americans,
p51
aVgovernment is more than just a presidential election every four years.
p52
aVGovernment is a lifeline that provides services they need
p53
aVand depend on and deserve.
p54
aVWhich is, quite frankly,
p55
aVwhy government needs to get its shit together and catch up.
p56
aVJust saying.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Applause)
p59
aa(lp60
VNow, this wasn't always a problem I was passionate about.
p61
aVWhen I joined President Obama's campaign in 2008,
p62
aVwe brought the tech industry's best practices into politics.
p63
aVWe earned more money,
p64
aVwe engaged more volunteers
p65
aVand we earned more votes than any political campaign in history.
p66
aVWe were a cutting-edge start-up that changed the game of politics forever.
p67
aVSo when the President asked a small group of us
p68
aVto bring that very same disruption directly into government,
p69
aVI knew it wasn't going to be easy work,
p70
aVbut I was eager and showed up ready to get to work.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow, on my first day in DC,
p73
aVmy first day in government,
p74
aVI walked into the office and they handed me a laptop.
p75
aVAnd the laptop was running Windows 98.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VI mean, three entire presidential elections had come and gone
p80
aVsince the government had updated the operating system on that computer.
p81
aVThree elections!
p82
aVWhich is when we realized
p83
aVthis problem was a whole lot bigger than we ever could have imagined.
p84
aVLet me paint the picture for you.
p85
aa(lp86
VThe federal government is the largest institution in the world.
p87
aVIt spends over 86 billion dollars a year \u2014 86 billion \u2014
p88
aVon federal IT projects.
p89
aVFor context:
p90
aVthat is more than the entire venture capital industry spends
p91
aVannually \u2014 on everything.
p92
aVNow, the problem here
p93
aVis that we the taxpayers are not getting what we pay for,
p94
aVbecause 94 percent of federal IT projects
p95
aVare over budget or behind schedule.
p96
aV94 percent!
p97
aVFor those of you keeping score,
p98
aVyes, the number 94 is very close to 100.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VThere's another problem:
p103
aV40 percent of those never end up seeing the light of day.
p104
aVThey are completely scrapped or abandoned.
p105
aVNow, this is a very existentially painful moment for any organization,
p106
aVbecause it means as government continues to operate
p107
aVas it's programmed to do,
p108
aVfailure is nearly inevitable.
p109
aVAnd when the status quo is the riskiest option,
p110
aVthat means there is simply no other choice
p111
aVthan radical disruption.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo, what do we do about it?
p114
aVHow do we fix this?
p115
aVWell, the irony of all of this
p116
aVis that we actually don't have to look any further than our backyard,
p117
aVbecause right here in America are the very ideas, the very people,
p118
aVwho have swept our world into a radically different place
p119
aVthan it was two decades ago.
p120
aVSo what would it look like
p121
aVif it was actually as easy to get student loans or veterans' benefits
p122
aVas it is to order cat food to my house?
p123
aVWhat would it look like
p124
aVif there was an easy pathway for the very entrepreneurs and innovators
p125
aVwho have disrupted our tech sector
p126
aVto come and disrupt their government?
p127
aa(lp128
VWell, my friends, here's where we get to talk
p129
aVabout some of the exciting new formulas we've discovered
p130
aVfor creating change in government.
p131
aVEnter the United States Digital Service.
p132
aVThe United States Digital Service is a new network of start-ups,
p133
aVa team of teams,
p134
aVorganizing themselves across government to create radical change.
p135
aVThe mission of the United States Digital Service is to help government
p136
aVdeliver world-class digital services
p137
aVfor students, immigrants, children, the elderly \u2014 everybody \u2014
p138
aVat dramatically lower costs.
p139
aVWe are essentially trying to build a more awesome government,
p140
aVfor the people, by the people, today.
p141
aVWe don't care \u2014 (Applause) Thank you.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Applause)
p144
aa(lp145
VWho doesn't want a more awesome government, right?
p146
aa(lp147
VWe don't care about politics.
p148
aVWe care about making government work better,
p149
aVbecause it's the only one we've got.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Applause)
p152
aa(lp153
VNow, you can think of our team \u2014 well, it's pretty funny \u2014
p154
aVyou can think of our team a little bit like
p155
aVthe Peace Corps meets DARPA meets SEAL Team 6.
p156
aVWe're like the Peace Corps for nerds,
p157
aVbut instead of traveling to crazy, interesting, far-off places,
p158
aVyou spend a lot of time indoors, behind computers,
p159
aVhelping restore the fabric of our democracy.
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VNow, this team \u2014 our playbook for the United States Digital Service
p164
aVis pretty simple.
p165
aVThe first play is we recruit the very best talent
p166
aVour country has to offer,
p167
aVand recruit them for short tours of duty inside government.
p168
aVThese are the very people who have helped build the products and companies
p169
aVthat have made our tech sector amongst the most innovative in the world.
p170
aVSecond, we pair these incredible people from the tech core
p171
aVwith the dedicated civil servants already inside government
p172
aVon the ground creating change.
p173
aVThird, we strategically deploy them in a targeted formation
p174
aVat the most mission-critical, life-changing, important services
p175
aVthat government offers.
p176
aVAnd finally, we give them massive air cover,
p177
aVfrom the leadership inside the agencies
p178
aVall the way up to the President himself,
p179
aVto transform these services for the better.
p180
aa(lp181
VNow, this team is beginning to disrupt
p182
aVhow government does business from the inside out.
p183
aVIf you study classic patterns of disruption,
p184
aVone very common pattern is rather simple.
p185
aVIt's to take something that has become routine and standard in one industry
p186
aVand apply it to another where it's a radical departure
p187
aVfrom the status quo.
p188
aVThink about what Airbnb took that was normal from hospitality
p189
aVand revolutionized my apartment.
p190
aVThe United States Digital Service is doing exactly that.
p191
aVWe are taking what Silicon Valley and the private sector has learned
p192
aVthrough a ton of hard work
p193
aVabout how to build planetary-scale digital services
p194
aVthat delight users at lower cost,
p195
aVand we're applying that to government,
p196
aVwhere it is a radical departure from the status quo.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow, the good news is:
p199
aVit's starting to work.
p200
aVWe know this because we can already see the results
p201
aVfrom some of our early projects, like the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov,
p202
aVwhen that went off the rails.
p203
aVFixing Healthcare.gov was the first place that we ran this play,
p204
aVand today we are taking that same play
p205
aVand scaling it across a large number
p206
aVof government's most important citizen-facing services.
p207
aVNow, if I can take a moment
p208
aVand brag about the team for a second \u2014
p209
aVit is the highest concentration of badasses
p210
aVI could have ever dreamed of.
p211
aVWe have top talent from Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and the likes,
p212
aVall on staff today,
p213
aVall choosing to join their government.
p214
aVAnd what's incredible is,
p215
aVeverybody is as eager and kind as they are intelligent.
p216
aVAnd I might add, by the way, over half of us are women.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Applause)
p219
aa(lp220
VThe best way to understand this strategy
p221
aVis actually to walk through a couple of examples
p222
aVof how it's working out in the wild.
p223
aVI'm going to give you two examples quickly.
p224
aa(lp225
VThe first one is about immigration.
p226
aVThis, my friends, is your typical immigration application.
p227
aVYes, you guessed it \u2014
p228
aVit's almost entirely paper-based.
p229
aVIn the best case,
p230
aVthe application takes about six to eight months to process.
p231
aVIt is physically shipped thousands of miles \u2014 thousands of miles! \u2014
p232
aVbetween no less than six processing centers.
p233
aVNow, little story:
p234
aVabout a decade ago,
p235
aVthe government thought that if it brought this system online,
p236
aVit could save taxpayer dollars and provide a better service,
p237
aVwhich was a great idea.
p238
aVSo, the typical government process began.
p239
aVSix years and 1.2 billion dollars later,
p240
aVno working product was delivered \u2014
p241
aV1.2 billion with a "B."
p242
aVNow at this point, the agency responsible,
p243
aVUS Citizenship and Immigration Services,
p244
aVcould have kept pouring money into the failing program.
p245
aVSadly, that's what often happens.
p246
aVThat's the status quo today.
p247
aVBut they didn't.
p248
aVThe dedicated civil servants inside the agency
p249
aVdecided to stand up and call for change.
p250
aVWe deployed a small team of just six people,
p251
aVand what many people don't know is
p252
aVthat's the same size as the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov \u2014
p253
aVjust six people.
p254
aVAnd that team jumped in, side-by-side,
p255
aVto support the agency in transitioning this project
p256
aVinto more modern business practices, more modern development practices.
p257
aVNow, in non-tech speak,
p258
aVwhat that basically means is taking big, multi-year projects
p259
aVand breaking them up into bite-sized chunks,
p260
aVso that way we can reduce the risk
p261
aVand actually start to see results every couple of weeks,
p262
aVinstead of waiting in a black box for years.
p263
aa(lp264
VSo within less than three months of our team being on the ground,
p265
aVwe were already able to push our first products to production.
p266
aVThe first one, this is the form I-90.
p267
aVThis is used to file for your replacement green card.
p268
aVNow, for immigrant visa holders,
p269
aVa replacement green card is a big deal.
p270
aVYour green card is your proof of identification,
p271
aVit's your work authorization,
p272
aVit's the proof that you can be here in this country.
p273
aVSo waiting six months while the government processes the replacement
p274
aVis not cool.
p275
aVI'm excited to tell you that today,
p276
aVyou can now, for the first time, file for a replacement green card
p277
aVentirely online without anyone touching a piece of paper.
p278
aVIt is faster, it is cheaper,
p279
aVand it's a better user experience for the applicant
p280
aVand the government employees alike.
p281
aa(lp282
V(Applause)
p283
aa(lp284
VAnother one, quickly.
p285
aVLast fall, we just released a brand-new practice civics test.
p286
aVSo as part of becoming a US citizen,
p287
aVyou have to pass a civics test.
p288
aVFor anyone who has taken this test, it can be quite the stressful process.
p289
aVSo our team released a very easy, simple-to-use tool in plain language
p290
aVto help people prepare,
p291
aVto help ease their nerves,
p292
aVto help them feel more confident
p293
aVin taking the next step in pursuing their American dream.
p294
aVBecause all of this work, all of this work on immigration,
p295
aVis about taking complicated processes and making them more human.
p296
aa(lp297
VThe other day, one of the dedicated civil servants on the ground
p298
aVsaid something incredibly profound.
p299
aVShe said that she's never been this hopeful or optimistic
p300
aVabout a project in her entire time in government.
p301
aVAnd she's been doing this for 30 years.
p302
aVThat is exactly the kind of hope and culture change
p303
aVwe are trying to create.
p304
aa(lp305
VFor my second example, I want to bring it back to veterans for a second,
p306
aVand what we are doing to build them a VA
p307
aVthat is worthy of their service and their sacrifice.
p308
aVI'm proud to say that just a few months ago,
p309
aVwe released a brand-new beta
p310
aVof a new website, Vets.gov.
p311
aVVets.gov is a simple, easy-to-use website
p312
aVthat brings all of the online services a veteran needs into one place.
p313
aVOne website, not thousands.
p314
aVThe site is a work in progress, but it's significant progress,
p315
aVbecause it's designed with the users who matter most:
p316
aVthe veterans themselves.
p317
aVThis might sound incredibly obvious, because it should be,
p318
aVbut sadly, this isn't normal for government.
p319
aVFar too often, product decisions are made by committees of stakeholders
p320
aVwho do their best to represent the interests of the user,
p321
aVbut they're not necessarily the users themselves.
p322
aVSo our team at the VA went out, we looked at the data,
p323
aVwe talked to veterans themselves
p324
aVand we started simple and small,
p325
aVwith the two most important services that matter most to them:
p326
aVeducation benefits and disability benefits.
p327
aVI'm proud to say that they are live on the site today,
p328
aVand as the team continues to streamline more services,
p329
aVthey will be ported over here, and the old sites, shut down.
p330
aa(lp331
V(Applause)
p332
aa(lp333
VTo me, this is what change looks like in 2016.
p334
aa(lp335
VWhen you walk out of the Oval Office,
p336
aVthe first time I was ever there, I noticed a quote
p337
aVthe President had embroidered on the rug.
p338
aVIt's the classic JFK quote.
p339
aVIt says, "No problem of human destiny is beyond human beings."
p340
aVIt's true.
p341
aVWe have the tools to solve these problems.
p342
aVWe have the tools to come together as a society, as a country,
p343
aVand to fix this together.
p344
aVYes, it's hard.
p345
aVIt's particularly hard when we have to fight,
p346
aVwhen we have to refuse to succumb to the belief that things won't change.
p347
aVBut in my experience,
p348
aVit's often the hardest things that are the most worth doing,
p349
aVbecause if we don't do them,
p350
aVwho will?
p351
aVThis is on us,
p352
aVall of us, together,
p353
aVbecause government is not an abstract institution or a concept.
p354
aVOur government is us.
p355
aa(lp356
V(Applause)
p357
aa(lp358
VToday, it is no longer a question
p359
aVof if change is possible.
p360
aVThe question is not, "Can we?"
p361
aVThe question is, "Will we?"
p362
aa(lp363
VWill you?
p364
aa(lp365
VThank you.
p366
aa(lp367
V(Applause)
p368
