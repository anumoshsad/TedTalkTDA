VTrees are wonderful arenas for discovery
p4
aVbecause of their tall stature, their complex structure,
p5
aVthe biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty.
p6
aVI used to climb trees for fun all the time
p7
aVand now, as a grown-up, I have made my profession understanding trees
p8
aVand forests, through the medium of science.
p9
aa(lp10
VThe most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy.
p11
aVAnd Dr. Terry Erwin, in 1983,
p12
aVcalled the canopy, "the last biotic frontier."
p13
aVI'd like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy,
p14
aVand share with you what canopy researchers are asking
p15
aVand also how they're communicating with other people outside of science.
p16
aa(lp17
VLet's start our journey on the forest floor
p18
aVof one of my study sites in Costa Rica.
p19
aVBecause of the overhanging leaves and branches,
p20
aVyou'll notice that the understory is very dark,
p21
aVit's very still.
p22
aVAnd what I'd like to do is take you up to the canopy,
p23
aVnot by putting all of you into ropes and harnesses,
p24
aVbut rather showing you a very short clip
p25
aVfrom a National Geographic film called "Heroes of the High Frontier."
p26
aVThis was filmed in Monteverde, Costa Rica
p27
aVand I think it gives us the best impression of what it's like
p28
aVto climb a giant strangler fig.
p29
aV(Music)
p30
aV(Growling)
p31
aV(Rustling)
p32
aa(lp33
VSo what you'll see up there is that it's really like the atmosphere of an open field,
p34
aVand there are tremendous numbers of plants and animals that have adapted
p35
aVto make their way and their life in the canopy.
p36
aVCommon groups, like the sloth here, have clear adaptations
p37
aVfor forest canopies, hanging on with their very strong claws.
p38
aVBut I'd like to describe to you a more subtle kind of diversity
p39
aVand tell you about the ants.
p40
aVThere are 10,000 species of ants that taxonomists \u2014
p41
aVpeople who describe and name animals \u2014 have named.
p42
aV4,000 of those ants live exclusively in the forest canopy.
p43
aa(lp44
VOne of the reasons I tell you about ants
p45
aVis because of my husband, who is in fact an ant taxonomist
p46
aVand when we got married, he promised to name an ant after me, which he did \u2014
p47
aVProcryptocerus nalini, a canopy ant.
p48
aVWe've had two children, August Andrew and Erika
p49
aVand actually, he named ants after them.
p50
aVSo we may be the only family that has an ant named after each one of us.
p51
aa(lp52
VBut my passion \u2014 in addition to Jack and my children \u2014
p53
aVare the plants, the so-called epiphytes,
p54
aVthose plants that grow up on trees.
p55
aVThey don't have roots that go into trunks nor to the forest floor.
p56
aVBut rather, it is their leaves that are adapted
p57
aVto intercept the dissolved nutrients that come to them in the form of mist and fog.
p58
aVThese plants occur in great diversity,
p59
aVover 28,000 species around the world.
p60
aVThey grow in tropical forests like this one
p61
aVand they also grow in temperate rainforests, that we find in Washington state.
p62
aa(lp63
VThese epiphytes are mainly dominated by the mosses.
p64
aVOne thing I want to point out is that underneath these live epiphytes,
p65
aVas they die and decompose, they actually construct an arboreal soil,
p66
aVboth in the temperate zone and in the tropics.
p67
aVAnd these mosses, generated by decomposing,
p68
aVare like peat moss in your garden.
p69
aVThey have a tremendous capacity for holding on to nutrients and water.
p70
aa(lp71
VOne of the surprising things I discovered
p72
aVis that, if you pull back with me on those mats of epiphytes,
p73
aVwhat you'll find underneath them are connections, networks
p74
aVof what we call canopy roots.
p75
aVThese are not epiphyte roots:
p76
aVthese are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves.
p77
aVAnd so those epiphytes are actually paying the landlord a bit of rent
p78
aVin exchange for being supported high above the forest floor.
p79
aa(lp80
VI was interested, and my canopy researcher colleagues have been interested
p81
aVin the dynamics of the canopy plants that live in the forest.
p82
aVWe've done stripping experiments
p83
aVwhere we've removed mats of epiphytes
p84
aVand looked at the rates of recolonization.
p85
aVWe had predicted that they would grow back very quickly
p86
aVand that they would come in encroaching from the side.
p87
aVWhat we found, however, was that they took an extremely long time \u2014
p88
aVover 20 years \u2014 to regenerate,
p89
aVstarting from the bottom and growing up.
p90
aVAnd even now, after 25 years,
p91
aVthey're not up there, they have not recolonized completely.
p92
aVAnd I use this little image to say
p93
aVthis is what happens to mosses.
p94
aVIf it's gone, it's gone,
p95
aVand if you're really lucky you might get something growing back from the bottom.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VSo, recolonization is really very slow.
p100
aVThese canopy communities are fragile.
p101
aVWell, when we look out, you and I, over that canopy
p102
aVof the intact primary forest,
p103
aVwhat we see is this enormous carpet of carbon.
p104
aVOne of the challenges that canopy researchers are attacking today
p105
aVis trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being sequestered.
p106
aVWe know it's a lot,
p107
aVbut we do not yet know the answers to how much,
p108
aVand by what processes, carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere,
p109
aVheld in its biomass, and moving on through the ecosystem.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo I hope I've showed you that canopy-dwellers
p112
aVare not just insignificant bits of green up high in the canopy
p113
aVthat Tarzan and Jane were interested in,
p114
aVbut rather that they foster biodiversity
p115
aVcontribute to ecosystem nutrient cycles,
p116
aVand they also help to keep our global climate stable.
p117
aa(lp118
VUp in the canopy, if you were sitting next to me
p119
aVand you turned around from those primary forest ecosystems,
p120
aVyou would also see scenes like this.
p121
aVScenes of forest destruction, forest harvesting
p122
aVand forest fragmentation,
p123
aVthereby making that intact tapestry of the canopy
p124
aVunable to function in the marvelous ways that it has
p125
aVwhen it is not disturbed by humans.
p126
aa(lp127
VI've also looked out on urban places like this
p128
aVand thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives.
p129
aVPeople who grew up in a place like this
p130
aVdid not have the opportunity to climb trees and form a relationship with trees
p131
aVand forests, as I did when I was a young girl.
p132
aVThis troubles me.
p133
aa(lp134
VHere in 2009, you know, it's not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist,
p135
aVgripping ourselves with these kinds of questions
p136
aVand trying to figure out how we can answer them.
p137
aVAnd especially, you know, as a small brown woman
p138
aVin a little college, in the upper northwest part of our country,
p139
aVfar away from the areas of power and money,
p140
aVI really have to ask myself, "What can I do about this?
p141
aVHow can I reconnect people with trees?"
p142
aa(lp143
VWell, I think that I can do something.
p144
aVI know that as a scientist, I have information
p145
aVand as a human being, I can communicate with anybody,
p146
aVinside or outside of academia.
p147
aVAnd so, that's what I've begin doing,
p148
aVand so I'd like to unveil the International Canopy Network here.
p149
aVWe consult to the media about canopy questions;
p150
aVwe have a canopy newsletter;
p151
aVwe have an email LISTSERV.
p152
aVAnd so we're trying to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy,
p153
aVthe beauty of the canopy,
p154
aVthe necessity of intact canopies,
p155
aVto people outside of academia.
p156
aVWe also recognize that a lot of the products that we make \u2014
p157
aVthose videos and so forth \u2014
p158
aVyou know, they don't reach everybody,
p159
aVand so we've been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia,
p160
aVand outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to.
p161
aa(lp162
VTreetop Barbie is a great example of that.
p163
aVWhat we do, my students in my lab and I,
p164
aVis we buy Barbies from Goodwill and Value Village,
p165
aVwe dress her in clothes that have been made by seamstresses
p166
aVand we send her out with a canopy handbook.
p167
aVAnd my feeling is \u2014
p168
aa(lp169
V(Applause)
p170
aa(lp171
VThank you.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Applause)
p174
aa(lp175
V\u2014 that we've taken this pop icon and we have just tweaked her a little bit
p176
aVto become an ambassador who can carry the message
p177
aVthat being a woman scientist studying treetops is actually a really great thing.
p178
aa(lp179
VWe've also made partnerships with artists,
p180
aVwith people who understand and can communicate the aesthetic beauty
p181
aVof trees and forest canopies.
p182
aVAnd I'd like to just tell you one of our projects,
p183
aVwhich is the generation of Canopy Confluences.
p184
aVWhat I do is I bring together scientists and artists of all kinds,
p185
aVand we spend a week in the forest on these little platforms;
p186
aVand we look at nature, we look at trees, we look at the canopy,
p187
aVand we communicate, and exchange, and express what we see together.
p188
aVThe results have been fantastic.
p189
aa(lp190
VI'll just give you a few examples.
p191
aVThis is a fantastic installation by Bruce Chao
p192
aVwho is chair of the Sculpture and Glass Blowing Department
p193
aVat Rhode Island School of Design.
p194
aVHe saw nests in the canopy at one of our Canopy Confluences
p195
aVin the Pacific Northwest, and created this beautiful sculpture.
p196
aVWe've had dance people up in the canopy.
p197
aVJodi Lomask, and her wonderful troupe Capacitor,
p198
aVjoined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in Costa Rica.
p199
aVThey made a fabulous dance called "Biome."
p200
aa(lp201
VThey danced in the forest,
p202
aVand we are taking this dance, my scientific outreach communications,
p203
aVand also linking up with environmental groups,
p204
aVto go to different cities and to perform
p205
aVthe science, the dance and the environmental outreach
p206
aVthat we hope will make a difference.
p207
aVWe brought musicians to the canopy,
p208
aVand they made their music \u2014 and it's fantastic music.
p209
aVWe had wooden flutists, we had oboists,
p210
aVwe had opera singers, we had guitar players,
p211
aVand we had rap singers.
p212
aVAnd I brought a little segment to give you
p213
aVof Duke Brady's "Canopy Rap."
p214
aV(Music) That's Duke!
p215
aa(lp216
V(Applause)
p217
aa(lp218
VThis experience of working with Duke
p219
aValso led me to initiate a program called Sound Science.
p220
aVI saw the power of Duke's song with urban youth \u2014
p221
aVan audience, you know, I as a middle-aged professor,
p222
aVI don't have a hope of getting to \u2014
p223
aVin terms of convincing them of the importance of wildlands.
p224
aVSo I engaged Caution, this rap singer,
p225
aVwith a group of young people from inner-city Tacoma.
p226
aVWe went out to the forest, I would pick up a branch,
p227
aVCaution would rap on it,
p228
aVand suddenly that branch was really cool.
p229
aVAnd then the students would come into our sound studios,
p230
aVthey would make their own rap songs with their own beats.
p231
aVThey ended up making a CD
p232
aVwhich they took home to their family and friends,
p233
aVthereby expressing their own experiences with nature
p234
aVin their own medium.
p235
aa(lp236
VThe final project I'll talk about is one that's very close to my heart,
p237
aVand it involves an economic and social value
p238
aVthat is associated with epiphytic plants.
p239
aVIn the Pacific Northwest,
p240
aVthere's a whole industry of moss-harvesting
p241
aVfrom old-growth forests.
p242
aVThese mosses are taken from the forest;
p243
aVthey're used by the floriculture industry, by florists,
p244
aVto make arrangements and make hanging baskets.
p245
aVIt's a 265 million dollar industry
p246
aVand it's increasing rapidly.
p247
aVIf you remember that bald guy,
p248
aVyou'll know that what has been stripped off of these trunks
p249
aVin the Pacific Northwest old-growth forest
p250
aVis going to take decades and decades to come back.
p251
aVSo this whole industry is unsustainable.
p252
aVWhat can I, as an ecologist, do about that?
p253
aa(lp254
VWell, my thought was that I could learn how to grow mosses,
p255
aVand that way we wouldn't have to take them out of the wild.
p256
aVAnd I thought, if I had some partners that could help me with this,
p257
aVthat would be great.
p258
aVAnd so, I thought perhaps incarcerated men and women \u2014
p259
aVwho don't have access to nature,
p260
aVwho often have a lot of time, they often have space,
p261
aVand you don't need any sharp tools to work with mosses \u2014
p262
aVwould be great partners.
p263
aVAnd they have become excellent partners.
p264
aVThe best I can imagine.
p265
aVThey were very enthusiastic.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Applause)
p268
aa(lp269
VThey were incredibly enthusiastic about the work.
p270
aVThey learned how to distinguish different species of mosses,
p271
aVwhich, to tell you the truth,
p272
aVis a lot more than my undergraduate students at the Evergreen College can do.
p273
aVAnd they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design
p274
aVin order to grow these mosses.
p275
aVWe've been successful as partners
p276
aVin figuring out which species grow the fastest,
p277
aVand I've just been overwhelmed with how successful this has been.
p278
aVBecause the prison wardens were very enthusiastic about this as well,
p279
aVI started a Science and Sustainability Seminar in the prisons.
p280
aVI brought my scientific colleagues and sustainability practitioners into the prison.
p281
aVWe gave talks once a month,
p282
aVand that actually ended up implementing
p283
aVsome amazing sustainability projects at the prisons \u2014
p284
aVorganic gardens, worm culture, recycling,
p285
aVwater catchment and beekeeping. (Applause)
p286
aa(lp287
VOur latest endeavor,
p288
aa(lp289
Vwith a grant
p290
aa(lp291
Vfrom the Department of Corrections at Washington state,
p292
aVthey've asked us to expand this program to three more prisons.
p293
aVAnd our new project is having the inmates and ourselves
p294
aVlearn how to raise the Oregon spotted frog
p295
aVwhich is a highly endangered amphibian in Washington state and Oregon.
p296
aVSo they will raise them \u2014 in captivity, of course \u2014
p297
aVfrom eggs to tadpoles and onward to frogs.
p298
aVAnd they will have the pleasure, many of them,
p299
aVof seeing those frogs that they've raised from eggs and helped develop,
p300
aVhelped nurture, move out into protected wildlands
p301
aVto augment the number of endangered species out there in the wild.
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd so, I think for many reasons \u2014
p304
aVecological, social, economic and perhaps even spiritual \u2014
p305
aVthis has been a tremendous project
p306
aVand I'm really looking forward to
p307
aVnot only myself and my students doing it,
p308
aVbut also to promote and teach other scientists how to do this.
p309
aVAs many of you are aware, the world of academia is a rather inward-looking one.
p310
aVI'm trying to help researchers move more outward
p311
aVto have their own partnerships
p312
aVwith people outside of the academic community.
p313
aVAnd so I'm hoping that my husband Jack, the ant taxonomist,
p314
aVcan perhaps work with Mattel to make Taxonomist Ken.
p315
aVPerhaps Ben Zander and Bill Gates could get together
p316
aVand make an opera about AIDS.
p317
aVOr perhaps Al Gore and Naturally 7 could make a song about climate change
p318
aVthat would really make you clap your hands.
p319
aa(lp320
VSo, although it's a little bit of a fantasy, I think it's also a reality.
p321
aVGiven the duress that we're feeling environmentally in these times,
p322
aVit is time for scientists to reach outward,
p323
aVand time for those outside of science to reach towards academia as well.
p324
aVI started my career with trying to understand the mysteries of forests
p325
aVwith the tools of science.
p326
aVBy making these partnerships that I described to you,
p327
aVI have really opened my mind and, I have to say, my heart
p328
aVto have a greater understanding,
p329
aVto make other discoveries about nature and myself.
p330
aa(lp331
VWhen I look into my heart, I see trees \u2014
p332
aVthis is actually an image of a real heart \u2014
p333
aVthere are trees in our hearts,
p334
aVthere are trees in your hearts.
p335
aVWhen we come to understand nature,
p336
aVwe are touching the most deep, the most important parts of our self.
p337
aVIn these partnerships, I have also learned
p338
aVthat people tend to compartmentalize themselves
p339
aVinto IT people, and movie star people, and scientists,
p340
aVbut when we share nature,
p341
aVwhen we share our perspectives about nature,
p342
aVwe find a common denominator.
p343
aa(lp344
VFinally, as a scientist and as a person
p345
aVand now, as part of the TED community,
p346
aVI feel that I have better tools
p347
aVto go out to trees, to go out to forests, to go out to nature,
p348
aVto make new discoveries about nature \u2014
p349
aVand about humans' place in nature
p350
aVwherever we are and whomever you are.
p351
