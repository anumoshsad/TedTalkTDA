V"I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,
p4
aVand Mourners to and fro
p5
aVkept treading \u2014 treading \u2014 till [it seemed]
p6
aVthat Sense was breaking through \u2014
p7
aVAnd when they all were seated,
p8
aVa Service, like a Drum \u2014
p9
aVkept beating \u2014 beating \u2014 till I [thought]
p10
aVmy Mind was going numb \u2014
p11
aVAnd then I heard them lift a Box and creak across my Soul
p12
aVwith those same Boots of Lead, again,
p13
aVthen Space \u2014 began to toll,
p14
aVAs [all] the Heavens were a Bell, and Being, [but] an Ear,
p15
aVand I, and Silence, some strange Race,
p16
aVwrecked, solitary, here \u2014
p17
aV[And] then a Plank in Reason, broke,
p18
aVand I fell down and down \u2014
p19
aVand hit a World, at every plunge,
p20
aVand Finished knowing \u2014 then \u2014"
p21
aa(lp22
VWe know depression through metaphors.
p23
aVEmily Dickinson was able to convey it in language,
p24
aVGoya in an image.
p25
aVHalf the purpose of art is to describe such iconic states.
p26
aa(lp27
VAs for me, I had always thought myself tough,
p28
aVone of the people who could survive
p29
aVif I'd been sent to a concentration camp.
p30
aa(lp31
VIn 1991, I had a series of losses.
p32
aVMy mother died,
p33
aVa relationship I'd been in ended,
p34
aVI moved back to the United States from some years abroad,
p35
aVand I got through all of those experiences intact.
p36
aa(lp37
VBut in 1994, three years later,
p38
aVI found myself losing interest in almost everything.
p39
aVI didn't want to do any of the things I had previously wanted to do,
p40
aVand I didn't know why.
p41
aVThe opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality.
p42
aVAnd it was vitality
p43
aVthat seemed to seep away from me in that moment.
p44
aVEverything there was to do seemed like too much work.
p45
aVI would come home
p46
aVand I would see the red light flashing on my answering machine,
p47
aVand instead of being thrilled to hear from my friends,
p48
aVI would think,
p49
aV"What a lot of people that is to have to call back."
p50
aVOr I would decide I should have lunch,
p51
aVand then I would think, but I'd have to get the food out
p52
aVand put it on a plate
p53
aVand cut it up and chew it and swallow it,
p54
aVand it felt to me like the Stations of the Cross.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd one of the things that often gets lost in discussions of depression
p57
aVis that you know it's ridiculous.
p58
aVYou know it's ridiculous while you're experiencing it.
p59
aVYou know that most people manage
p60
aVto listen to their messages and eat lunch
p61
aVand organize themselves to take a shower
p62
aVand go out the front door
p63
aVand that it's not a big deal,
p64
aVand yet you are nonetheless in its grip
p65
aVand you are unable to figure out any way around it.
p66
aVAnd so I began to feel myself doing less
p67
aVand thinking less
p68
aVand feeling less.
p69
aVIt was a kind of nullity.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd then the anxiety set in.
p72
aVIf you told me that I'd have to be depressed for the next month,
p73
aVI would say, "As long I know it'll be over in November, I can do it."
p74
aVBut if you said to me,
p75
aV"You have to have acute anxiety for the next month,"
p76
aVI would rather slit my wrist than go through it.
p77
aVIt was the feeling all the time
p78
aVlike that feeling you have if you're walking
p79
aVand you slip or trip and the ground is rushing up at you,
p80
aVbut instead of lasting half a second, the way that does,
p81
aVit lasted for six months.
p82
aVIt's a sensation of being afraid all the time
p83
aVbut not even knowing what it is that you're afraid of.
p84
aVAnd it was at that point that I began to think
p85
aVthat it was just too painful to be alive,
p86
aVand that the only reason not to kill oneself
p87
aVwas so as not to hurt other people.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd finally one day, I woke up
p90
aVand I thought perhaps I'd had a stroke,
p91
aVbecause I lay in bed completely frozen,
p92
aVlooking at the telephone, thinking,
p93
aV"Something is wrong and I should call for help,"
p94
aVand I couldn't reach out my arm
p95
aVand pick up the phone and dial.
p96
aVAnd finally, after four full hours of my lying and staring at it,
p97
aVthe phone rang,
p98
aVand somehow I managed to pick it up,
p99
aVand it was my father, and I said,
p100
aV"I'm in serious trouble. We need to do something."
p101
aa(lp102
VThe next day I started with the medications and the therapy.
p103
aVAnd I also started reckoning with this terrible question:
p104
aVIf I'm not the tough person
p105
aVwho could have made it through a concentration camp,
p106
aVthen who am I?
p107
aVAnd if I have to take medication,
p108
aVis that medication making me more fully myself,
p109
aVor is it making me someone else?
p110
aVAnd how do I feel about it if it's making me someone else?
p111
aa(lp112
VI had two advantages as I went into the fight.
p113
aVThe first is that I knew that, objectively speaking,
p114
aVI had a nice life,
p115
aVand that if I could only get well,
p116
aVthere was something at the other end that was worth living for.
p117
aVAnd the other was that I had access to good treatment.
p118
aa(lp119
VBut I nonetheless emerged and relapsed,
p120
aVand emerged and relapsed,
p121
aVand emerged and relapsed,
p122
aVand finally understood
p123
aVI would have to be on medication and in therapy forever.
p124
aVAnd I thought,
p125
aV"But is it a chemical problem or a psychological problem?
p126
aVAnd does it need a chemical cure or a philosophical cure?"
p127
aVAnd I couldn't figure out which it was.
p128
aVAnd then I understood that actually,
p129
aVwe aren't advanced enough in either area for it to explain things fully.
p130
aVThe chemical cure and the psychological cure
p131
aVboth have a role to play,
p132
aVand I also figured out that depression was something
p133
aVthat was braided so deep into us
p134
aVthat there was no separating it from our character and personality.
p135
aa(lp136
VI want to say that the treatments we have for depression are appalling.
p137
aVThey're not very effective.
p138
aVThey're extremely costly.
p139
aVThey come with innumerable side effects.
p140
aVThey're a disaster.
p141
aVBut I am so grateful that I live now and not 50 years ago,
p142
aVwhen there would have been almost nothing to be done.
p143
aVI hope that 50 years hence,
p144
aVpeople will hear about my treatments
p145
aVand be appalled that anyone endured such primitive science.
p146
aa(lp147
VDepression is the flaw in love.
p148
aVIf you were married to someone and thought,
p149
aV"Well, if my wife dies, I'll find another one,"
p150
aVit wouldn't be love as we know it.
p151
aVThere's no such thing as love without the anticipation of loss,
p152
aVand that specter of despair can be the engine of intimacy.
p153
aa(lp154
VThere are three things people tend to confuse:
p155
aVdepression, grief and sadness.
p156
aVGrief is explicitly reactive.
p157
aVIf you have a loss and you feel incredibly unhappy,
p158
aVand then, six months later,
p159
aVyou are still deeply sad, but you're functioning a little better,
p160
aVit's probably grief,
p161
aVand it will probably ultimately resolve itself in some measure.
p162
aVIf you experience a catastrophic loss,
p163
aVand you feel terrible,
p164
aVand six months later you can barely function at all,
p165
aVthen it's probably a depression that was triggered
p166
aVby the catastrophic circumstances.
p167
aVThe trajectory tells us a great deal.
p168
aVPeople think of depression as being just sadness.
p169
aVIt's much, much too much sadness,
p170
aVmuch too much grief
p171
aVat far too slight a cause.
p172
aa(lp173
VAs I set out to understand depression,
p174
aVand to interview people who had experienced it,
p175
aVI found that there were people who seemed, on the surface,
p176
aVto have what sounded like relatively mild depression
p177
aVwho were nonetheless utterly disabled by it.
p178
aVAnd there were other people who had what sounded
p179
aVas they described it like terribly severe depression
p180
aVwho nonetheless had good lives
p181
aVin the interstices between their depressive episodes.
p182
aVAnd I set out to find out what it is that causes some people
p183
aVto be more resilient than other people.
p184
aVWhat are the mechanisms that allow people to survive?
p185
aVAnd I went out and I interviewed person after person
p186
aVwho was suffering with depression.
p187
aa(lp188
VOne of the first people I interviewed
p189
aVdescribed depression as a slower way of being dead,
p190
aVand that was a good thing for me to hear early on
p191
aVbecause it reminded me that that slow way of being dead
p192
aVcan lead to actual deadness,
p193
aVthat this is a serious business.
p194
aVIt's the leading disability worldwide,
p195
aVand people die of it every day.
p196
aa(lp197
VOne of the people I talked to when I was trying to understand this
p198
aVwas a beloved friend who I had known for many years,
p199
aVand who had had a psychotic episode in her freshman year of college,
p200
aVand then plummeted into a horrific depression.
p201
aVShe had bipolar illness,
p202
aVor manic depression, as it was then known.
p203
aVAnd then she did very well for many years on lithium,
p204
aVand then eventually, she was taken off her lithium
p205
aVto see how she would do without it,
p206
aVand she had another psychosis,
p207
aVand then plunged into the worst depression that I had ever seen
p208
aVin which she sat in her parents' apartment,
p209
aVmore or less catatonic, essentially without moving,
p210
aVday after day after day.
p211
aVAnd when I interviewed her about that experience some years later \u2014
p212
aVshe's a poet and psychotherapist named Maggie Robbins \u2014
p213
aVwhen I interviewed her, she said,
p214
aV"I was singing 'Where Have All The Flowers Gone,'
p215
aVover and over, to occupy my mind.
p216
aVI was singing to blot out the things my mind was saying,
p217
aVwhich were, 'You are nothing. You are nobody.
p218
aVYou don't even deserve to live.'
p219
aVAnd that was when I really started thinking
p220
aVabout killing myself."
p221
aa(lp222
VYou don't think in depression that you've put on a gray veil
p223
aVand are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood.
p224
aVYou think that the veil has been taken away,
p225
aVthe veil of happiness,
p226
aVand that now you're seeing truly.
p227
aVIt's easier to help schizophrenics who perceive
p228
aVthat there's something foreign inside of them that needs to be exorcised,
p229
aVbut it's difficult with depressives,
p230
aVbecause we believe we are seeing the truth.
p231
aa(lp232
VBut the truth lies.
p233
aVI became obsessed with that sentence:
p234
aV"But the truth lies."
p235
aVAnd I discovered, as I talked to depressive people,
p236
aVthat they have many delusional perceptions.
p237
aVPeople will say, "No one loves me."
p238
aVAnd you say, "I love you,
p239
aVyour wife loves you, your mother loves you."
p240
aVYou can answer that one pretty readily, at least for most people.
p241
aVBut people who are depressed will also say,
p242
aV"No matter what we do, we're all just going to die in the end."
p243
aVOr they'll say, "There can be no true communion
p244
aVbetween two human beings.
p245
aVEach of us is trapped in his own body."
p246
aVTo which you have to say,
p247
aV"That's true,
p248
aVbut I think we should focus right now on what to have for breakfast."
p249
aa(lp250
V(Laughter)
p251
aa(lp252
VA lot of the time,
p253
aVwhat they are expressing is not illness, but insight,
p254
aVand one comes to think what's really extraordinary
p255
aVis that most of us know about those existential questions
p256
aVand they don't distract us very much.
p257
aVThere was a study I particularly liked
p258
aVin which a group of depressed and a group of non-depressed people
p259
aVwere asked to play a video game for an hour,
p260
aVand at the end of the hour,
p261
aVthey were asked how many little monsters they thought they had killed.
p262
aVThe depressive group was usually accurate to within about 10 percent,
p263
aVand the non-depressed people
p264
aVguessed between 15 and 20 times as many little monsters \u2014
p265
aa(lp266
V(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
Vas they had actually killed.
p269
aa(lp270
VA lot of people said, when I chose to write about my depression,
p271
aVthat it must be very difficult to be out of that closet,
p272
aVto have people know.
p273
aVThey said, "Do people talk to you differently?"
p274
aVI said, "Yes, people talk to me differently.
p275
aVThey talk to me differently insofar
p276
aVas they start telling me about their experience,
p277
aVor their sister's experience,
p278
aVor their friend's experience.
p279
aVThings are different because now I know
p280
aVthat depression is the family secret that everyone has.
p281
aa(lp282
VI went a few years ago to a conference,
p283
aVand on Friday of the three-day conference,
p284
aVone of the participants took me aside, and she said,
p285
aV"I suffer from depression and I'm a little embarrassed about it,
p286
aVbut I've been taking this medication,
p287
aVand I just wanted to ask you what you think?"
p288
aVAnd so I did my best to give her such advice as I could.
p289
aVAnd then she said, "You know, my husband would never understand this.
p290
aVHe's really the kind of guy to whom this wouldn't make any sense,
p291
aVso, you know, it's just between us."
p292
aVAnd I said, "Yes, that's fine."
p293
aVOn Sunday of the same conference,
p294
aVher husband took me aside,
p295
aa(lp296
V(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
Vand he said, "My wife wouldn't think
p299
aVthat I was really much of a guy if she knew this,
p300
aVbut I've been dealing with this depression and I'm taking some medication,
p301
aVand I wondered what you think?"
p302
aVThey were hiding the same medication
p303
aVin two different places in the same bedroom.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Laughter)
p306
aa(lp307
VAnd I said that I thought communication within the marriage
p308
aVmight be triggering some of their problems.
p309
aa(lp310
V(Laughter)
p311
aa(lp312
VBut I was also struck
p313
aVby the burdensome nature of such mutual secrecy.
p314
aVDepression is so exhausting.
p315
aVIt takes up so much of your time and energy,
p316
aVand silence about it,
p317
aVit really does make the depression worse.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd then I began thinking
p320
aVabout all the ways people make themselves better.
p321
aVI'd started off as a medical conservative.
p322
aVI thought there were a few kinds of therapy that worked,
p323
aVit was clear what they were \u2014
p324
aVthere was medication,
p325
aVthere were certain psychotherapies,
p326
aVthere was possibly electroconvulsive treatment,
p327
aVand that everything else was nonsense.
p328
aVBut then I discovered something.
p329
aVIf you have brain cancer,
p330
aVand you say that standing on your head for 20 minutes every morning
p331
aVmakes you feel better,
p332
aVit may make you feel better, but you still have brain cancer,
p333
aVand you'll still probably die from it.
p334
aVBut if you say that you have depression,
p335
aVand standing on your head for 20 minutes every day
p336
aVmakes you feel better, then it's worked,
p337
aVbecause depression is an illness of how you feel,
p338
aVand if you feel better,
p339
aVthen you are effectively not depressed anymore.
p340
aVSo I became much more tolerant
p341
aVof the vast world of alternative treatments.
p342
aa(lp343
VAnd I get letters, I get hundreds of letters
p344
aVfrom people writing to tell me about what's worked for them.
p345
aVSomeone was asking me backstage today about meditation.
p346
aVMy favorite of the letters that I got was the one that came from a woman
p347
aVwho wrote and said that she had tried therapy, medication,
p348
aVshe had tried pretty much everything,
p349
aVand she had found a solution and hoped I would tell the world,
p350
aVand that was making little things from yarn.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Laughter)
p353
aa(lp354
VShe sent me some of them.
p355
aa(lp356
V(Laughter)
p357
aa(lp358
VAnd I'm not wearing them right now.
p359
aa(lp360
V(Laughter)
p361
aa(lp362
VI suggested to her that she also should look up
p363
aVobsessive compulsive disorder in the DSM.
p364
aa(lp365
VAnd yet, when I went to look at alternative treatments,
p366
aVI also gained perspective on other treatments.
p367
aVI went through a tribal exorcism in Senegal
p368
aVthat involved a great deal of ram's blood
p369
aVand that I'm not going to detail right now,
p370
aVbut a few years afterwards I was in Rwanda,
p371
aVworking on a different project,
p372
aVand I happened to describe my experience to someone,
p373
aVand he said,
p374
aV"Well, that's West Africa, and we're in East Africa,
p375
aVand our rituals are in some ways very different,
p376
aVbut we do have some rituals
p377
aVthat have something in common with what you're describing."
p378
aVAnd he said,
p379
aV"But we've had a lot of trouble with Western mental health workers,
p380
aVespecially the ones who came right after the genocide."
p381
aVI said, "What kind of trouble did you have?"
p382
aVAnd he said, "Well, they would do this bizarre thing.
p383
aVThey didn't take people out in the sunshine
p384
aVwhere you begin to feel better.
p385
aVThey didn't include drumming or music to get people's blood going.
p386
aVThey didn't involve the whole community.
p387
aVThey didn't externalize the depression as an invasive spirit.
p388
aVInstead what they did was they took people one at a time into dingy little rooms
p389
aVand had them talk for an hour
p390
aVabout bad things that had happened to them."
p391
aa(lp392
V(Laughter)
p393
aa(lp394
V(Applause)
p395
aa(lp396
VHe said, "We had to ask them to leave the country."
p397
aa(lp398
V(Laughter)
p399
aa(lp400
VNow at the other end of alternative treatments,
p401
aVlet me tell you about Frank Russakoff.
p402
aVFrank Russakoff had the worst depression perhaps that I've ever seen in a man.
p403
aVHe was constantly depressed.
p404
aVHe was, when I met him,
p405
aVat a point at which every month, he would have electroshock treatment.
p406
aVThen he would feel sort of disoriented for a week.
p407
aVThen he would feel okay for a week.
p408
aVThen he would have a week of going downhill.
p409
aVAnd then he would have another electroshock treatment.
p410
aVAnd he said to me when I met him,
p411
aV"It's unbearable to go through my weeks this way.
p412
aVI can't go on this way,
p413
aVand I've figured out how I'm going to end it
p414
aVif I don't get better."
p415
aV"But," he said to me, "I heard about a protocol at Mass General
p416
aVfor a procedure called a cingulotomy, which is a brain surgery,
p417
aVand I think I'm going to give that a try."
p418
aVAnd I remember being amazed at that point to think that someone
p419
aVwho clearly had so many bad experiences
p420
aVwith so many different treatments
p421
aVstill had buried in him, somewhere, enough optimism
p422
aVto reach out for one more.
p423
aVAnd he had the cingulotomy, and it was incredibly successful.
p424
aa(lp425
VHe's now a friend of mine.
p426
aVHe has a lovely wife and two beautiful children.
p427
aVHe wrote me a letter the Christmas after the surgery,
p428
aVand he said,
p429
aV"My father sent me two presents this year,
p430
aVFirst, a motorized CD rack from The Sharper Image
p431
aVthat I didn't really need,
p432
aVbut I knew he was giving it to me to celebrate
p433
aVthe fact that I'm living on my own and have a job I seem to love.
p434
aVAnd the other present was a photo of my grandmother,
p435
aVwho committed suicide.
p436
aVAs I unwrapped it, I began to cry,
p437
aVand my mother came over and said,
p438
aV'Are you crying because of the relatives you never knew?'
p439
aVAnd I said, 'She had the same disease I have.'
p440
aVI'm crying now as I write to you.
p441
aVIt's not that I'm so sad, but I get overwhelmed,
p442
aVI think, because I could have killed myself,
p443
aVbut my parents kept me going, and so did the doctors,
p444
aVand I had the surgery.
p445
aVI'm alive and grateful.
p446
aVWe live in the right time, even if it doesn't always feel like it."
p447
aa(lp448
VI was struck by the fact that depression
p449
aVis broadly perceived to be a modern, Western, middle-class thing,
p450
aVand I went to look at how it operated in a variety of other contexts,
p451
aVand one of the things I was most interested in
p452
aVwas depression among the indigent.
p453
aVAnd so I went out to try to look
p454
aVat what was being done for poor people with depression.
p455
aVAnd what I discovered is that poor people
p456
aVare mostly not being treated for depression.
p457
aVDepression is the result of a genetic vulnerability,
p458
aVwhich is presumably evenly distributed in the population,
p459
aVand triggering circumstances,
p460
aVwhich are likely to be more severe for people who are impoverished.
p461
aVAnd yet it turns out that if you have a really lovely life
p462
aVbut feel miserable all the time,
p463
aVyou think, "Why do I feel like this?
p464
aVI must have depression."
p465
aVAnd you set out to find treatment for it.
p466
aVBut if you have a perfectly awful life,
p467
aVand you feel miserable all the time,
p468
aVthe way you feel is commensurate with your life,
p469
aVand it doesn't occur to you to think,
p470
aV"Maybe this is treatable."
p471
aa(lp472
VAnd so we have an epidemic in this country
p473
aVof depression among impoverished people
p474
aVthat's not being picked up and that's not being treated
p475
aVand that's not being addressed,
p476
aVand it's a tragedy of a grand order.
p477
aVAnd so I found an academic
p478
aVwho was doing a research project in slums outside of D.C.,
p479
aVwhere she picked up women who had come in for other health problems
p480
aVand diagnosed them with depression,
p481
aVand then provided six months of the experimental protocol.
p482
aVOne of them, Lolly, came in,
p483
aVand this is what she said the day she came in.
p484
aVShe said, and she was a woman, by the way, who had seven children.
p485
aVShe said, "I used to have a job but I had to give it up
p486
aVbecause I couldn't go out of the house.
p487
aVI have nothing to say to my children.
p488
aVIn the morning, I can't wait for them to leave,
p489
aVand then I climb in bed and pull the covers over my head,
p490
aVand three o'clock when they come home,
p491
aVit just comes so fast."
p492
aVShe said, "I've been taking a lot of Tylenol,
p493
aVanything I can take so that I can sleep more.
p494
aVMy husband has been telling me I'm stupid, I'm ugly.
p495
aVI wish I could stop the pain."
p496
aa(lp497
VWell, she was brought into this experimental protocol,
p498
aVand when I interviewed her six months later,
p499
aVshe had taken a job working in childcare
p500
aVfor the U.S. Navy, she had left the abusive husband,
p501
aVand she said to me,
p502
aV"My kids are so much happier now."
p503
aVShe said, "There's one room in my new place for the boys
p504
aVand one room for the girls,
p505
aVbut at night, they're just all up on my bed,
p506
aVand we're doing homework all together and everything.
p507
aVOne of them wants to be a preacher,
p508
aVone of them wants to be a firefighter,
p509
aVand one of the girls says she's going to be a lawyer.
p510
aVThey don't cry like they used to,
p511
aVand they don't fight like they did.
p512
aVThat's all I need now, is my kids.
p513
aVThings keep on changing,
p514
aVthe way I dress, the way I feel, the way I act.
p515
aVI can go outside not being afraid anymore,
p516
aVand I don't think those bad feelings are coming back,
p517
aVand if it weren't for Dr. Miranda and that,
p518
aVI would still be at home with the covers pulled over my head,
p519
aVif I were still alive at all.
p520
aVI asked the Lord to send me an angel,
p521
aVand He heard my prayers."
p522
aa(lp523
VI was really moved by these experiences,
p524
aVand I decided that I wanted to write about them
p525
aVnot only in a book I was working on, but also in an article,
p526
aVand I got a commission from The New York Times Magazine
p527
aVto write about depression among the indigent.
p528
aa(lp529
VAnd I turned in my story,
p530
aVand my editor called me and said, "We really can't publish this."
p531
aa(lp532
VAnd I said, "Why not?"
p533
aa(lp534
VAnd she said, "It just is too far-fetched.
p535
aVThese people who are sort of at the very bottom rung of society
p536
aVand then they get a few months of treatment
p537
aVand they're virtually ready to run Morgan Stanley?
p538
aVIt's just too implausible."
p539
aVShe said, "I've never even heard of anything like it."
p540
aa(lp541
VAnd I said, "The fact that you've never heard of it
p542
aVis an indication that it is news."
p543
aa(lp544
V(Laughter)
p545
aa(lp546
V(Applause)
p547
aa(lp548
V"And you are a news magazine."
p549
aa(lp550
VSo after a certain amount of negotiation, they agreed to it.
p551
aVBut I think a lot of what they said was connected in some strange way
p552
aVto this distaste that people still have for the idea of treatment,
p553
aVthe notion that somehow if we went out
p554
aVand treated a lot of people in indigent communities,
p555
aVthat would be exploitative,
p556
aVbecause we would be changing them.
p557
aVThere is this false moral imperative that seems to be all around us,
p558
aVthat treatment of depression,
p559
aVthe medications and so on, are an artifice,
p560
aVand that it's not natural.
p561
aVAnd I think that's very misguided.
p562
aVIt would be natural for people's teeth to fall out,
p563
aVbut there is nobody militating against toothpaste,
p564
aVat least not in my circles.
p565
aa(lp566
VPeople then say,
p567
aV"But isn't depression part of what people are supposed to experience?
p568
aVDidn't we evolve to have depression?
p569
aVIsn't it part of your personality?"
p570
aVTo which I would say, mood is adaptive.
p571
aVBeing able to have sadness and fear
p572
aVand joy and pleasure
p573
aVand all of the other moods that we have, that's incredibly valuable.
p574
aVAnd major depression
p575
aVis something that happens when that system gets broken.
p576
aVIt's maladaptive.
p577
aa(lp578
VPeople will come to me and say,
p579
aV"I think, though, if I just stick it out for another year,
p580
aVI think I can just get through this."
p581
aa(lp582
VAnd I always say to them, "You may get through it,
p583
aVbut you'll never be 37 again.
p584
aVLife is short, and that's a whole year you're talking about giving up.
p585
aVThink it through."
p586
aa(lp587
VIt's a strange poverty of the English language,
p588
aVand indeed of many other languages,
p589
aVthat we use this same word, depression,
p590
aVto describe how a kid feels when it rains on his birthday,
p591
aVand to describe how somebody feels the minute before they commit suicide.
p592
aa(lp593
VPeople say to me, "Well, is it continuous with normal sadness?"
p594
aVAnd I say, in a way it's continuous with normal sadness.
p595
aVThere is a certain amount of continuity,
p596
aVbut it's the same way there's continuity
p597
aVbetween having an iron fence outside your house
p598
aVthat gets a little rust spot
p599
aVthat you have to sand off and do a little repainting,
p600
aVand what happens if you leave the house for 100 years
p601
aVand it rusts through until it's only a pile of orange dust.
p602
aVAnd it's that orange dust spot,
p603
aVthat orange dust problem,
p604
aVthat's the one we're setting out to address.
p605
aa(lp606
VSo now people say,
p607
aV"You take these happy pills, and do you feel happy?"
p608
aVAnd I don't.
p609
aVBut I don't feel sad about having to eat lunch,
p610
aVand I don't feel sad about my answering machine,
p611
aVand I don't feel sad about taking a shower.
p612
aVI feel more, in fact, I think,
p613
aVbecause I can feel sadness without nullity.
p614
aVI feel sad about professional disappointments,
p615
aVabout damaged relationships,
p616
aVabout global warming.
p617
aVThose are the things that I feel sad about now.
p618
aVAnd I said to myself, well, what is the conclusion?
p619
aVHow did those people who have better lives
p620
aVeven with bigger depression manage to get through?
p621
aVWhat is the mechanism of resilience?
p622
aa(lp623
VAnd what I came up with over time
p624
aVwas that the people who deny their experience,
p625
aVand say, "I was depressed a long time ago,
p626
aVI never want to think about it again,
p627
aVI'm not going to look at it
p628
aVand I'm just going to get on with my life,"
p629
aVironically, those are the people who are most enslaved by what they have.
p630
aVShutting out the depression strengthens it.
p631
aVWhile you hide from it, it grows.
p632
aVAnd the people who do better
p633
aVare the ones who are able to tolerate the fact that they have this condition.
p634
aVThose who can tolerate their depression are the ones who achieve resilience.
p635
aa(lp636
VSo Frank Russakoff said to me,
p637
aV"If I had a do-over, I suppose I wouldn't do it this way,
p638
aVbut in a strange way, I'm grateful for what I've experienced.
p639
aVI'm glad to have been in the hospital 40 times.
p640
aVIt taught me so much about love,
p641
aVand my relationship with my parents and my doctors
p642
aVhas been so precious to me, and will be always."
p643
aa(lp644
VAnd Maggie Robbins said,
p645
aV"I used to volunteer in an AIDS clinic,
p646
aVand I would just talk and talk and talk,
p647
aVand the people I was dealing with weren't very responsive, and I thought,
p648
aV'That's not very friendly or helpful of them.'"
p649
aa(lp650
V(Laughter)
p651
aa(lp652
V"And then I realized,
p653
aVI realized that they weren't going to do more
p654
aVthan make those first few minutes of small talk.
p655
aVIt was simply going to be an occasion
p656
aVwhere I didn't have AIDS and I wasn't dying,
p657
aVbut could tolerate the fact that they did
p658
aVand they were.
p659
aVOur needs are our greatest assets.
p660
aVIt turns out I've learned to give all the things I need."
p661
aa(lp662
VValuing one's depression does not prevent a relapse,
p663
aVbut it may make the prospect of relapse
p664
aVand even relapse itself easier to tolerate.
p665
aVThe question is not so much of finding great meaning
p666
aVand deciding your depression has been very meaningful.
p667
aVIt's of seeking that meaning and thinking, when it comes again,
p668
aV"This will be hellish, but I will learn something from it."
p669
aVI have learned in my own depression
p670
aVhow big an emotion can be,
p671
aVhow it can be more real than facts,
p672
aVand I have found that that experience
p673
aVhas allowed me to experience positive emotion
p674
aVin a more intense and more focused way.
p675
aVThe opposite of depression is not happiness,
p676
aVbut vitality,
p677
aVand these days, my life is vital,
p678
aVeven on the days when I'm sad.
p679
aVI felt that funeral in my brain,
p680
aVand I sat next to the colossus at the edge of the world,
p681
aVand I have discovered something inside of myself
p682
aVthat I would have to call a soul
p683
aVthat I had never formulated until that day 20 years ago
p684
aVwhen hell came to pay me a surprise visit.
p685
aa(lp686
VI think that while I hated being depressed
p687
aVand would hate to be depressed again,
p688
aVI've found a way to love my depression.
p689
aVI love it because it has forced me to find and cling to joy.
p690
aVI love it because each day I decide,
p691
aVsometimes gamely,
p692
aVand sometimes against the moment's reason,
p693
aVto cleave to the reasons for living.
p694
aVAnd that, I think, is a highly privileged rapture.
p695
aa(lp696
VThank you.
