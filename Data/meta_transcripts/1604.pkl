VSo I want to talk a little bit about seeing the world
p4
aVfrom a totally unique point of view,
p5
aVand this world I'm going to talk about is the micro world.
p6
aVI've found, after doing this for many, many years,
p7
aVthat there's a magical world behind reality.
p8
aVAnd that can be seen directly through a microscope,
p9
aVand I'm going to show you some of this today.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo let's start off looking at something rather not-so-small,
p12
aVsomething that we can see with our naked eye,
p13
aVand that's a bee. So when you look at this bee,
p14
aVit's about this size here, it's about a centimeter.
p15
aVBut to really see the details of the bee, and really
p16
aVappreciate what it is, you have to look a little bit closer.
p17
aVSo that's just the eye of the bee with a microscope,
p18
aVand now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has
p19
aVthousands of individual eyes called ommatidia,
p20
aVand they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes
p21
aVso they know when they're right up close to something,
p22
aVbecause they can't see in stereo.
p23
aa(lp24
VAs we go smaller, here is a human hair.
p25
aVA human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see.
p26
aVIt's about a tenth of a millimeter.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd as we go smaller again,
p29
aVabout ten times smaller than that, is a cell.
p30
aVSo you could fit 10 human cells
p31
aVacross the diameter of a human hair.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo when we would look at cells, this is how I really got
p34
aVinvolved in biology and science is by looking
p35
aVat living cells in the microscope.
p36
aVWhen I first saw living cells in a microscope, I was
p37
aVabsolutely enthralled and amazed at what they looked like.
p38
aVSo if you look at the cell like that from the immune system,
p39
aVthey're actually moving all over the place.
p40
aVThis cell is looking for foreign objects,
p41
aVbacteria, things that it can find.
p42
aVAnd it's looking around, and when it finds something,
p43
aVand recognizes it being foreign,
p44
aVit will actually engulf it and eat it.
p45
aVSo if you look right there, it finds that little bacterium,
p46
aVand it engulfs it and eats it.
p47
aVIf you take some heart cells from an animal,
p48
aVand put it in a dish, they'll just sit there and beat.
p49
aVThat's their job. Every cell has a mission in life,
p50
aVand these cells, the mission is
p51
aVto move blood around our body.
p52
aVThese next cells are nerve cells, and right now,
p53
aVas we see and understand what we're looking at,
p54
aVour brains and our nerve cells are actually doing this
p55
aVright now. They're not just static. They're moving around
p56
aVmaking new connections, and that's what happens when we learn.
p57
aa(lp58
VAs you go farther down this scale here,
p59
aVthat's a micron, or a micrometer, and we go
p60
aVall the way down to here to a nanometer
p61
aVand an angstrom. Now, an angstrom is the size
p62
aVof the diameter of a hydrogen atom.
p63
aVThat's how small that is.
p64
aVAnd microscopes that we have today can actually see
p65
aVindividual atoms. So these are some pictures
p66
aVof individual atoms. Each bump here is an individual atom.
p67
aVThis is a ring of cobalt atoms.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo this whole world, the nano world, this area in here
p70
aVis called the nano world, and the nano world,
p71
aVthe whole micro world that we see,
p72
aVthere's a nano world that is wrapped up within that, and
p73
aVthe whole \u2014 and that is the world of molecules and atoms.
p74
aa(lp75
VBut I want to talk about this larger world,
p76
aVthe world of the micro world.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower,
p79
aVwhat would that flower look like, if the flower was this big?
p80
aVIt wouldn't look or feel like anything that we see
p81
aVwhen we look at a flower. So if you look at this flower here,
p82
aVand you're a little bug, if you're on that surface
p83
aVof that flower, that's what the terrain would look like.
p84
aVThe petal of that flower looks like that, so the ant
p85
aVis kind of crawling over these objects, and if you look
p86
aVa little bit closer at this stigma and the stamen here,
p87
aVthis is the style of that flower, and you notice
p88
aVthat it's got these little \u2014 these are like little jelly-like things
p89
aVthat are what are called spurs. These are nectar spurs.
p90
aVSo this little ant that's crawling here, it's like
p91
aVit's in a little Willy Wonka land.
p92
aVIt's like a little Disneyland for them. It's not like what we see.
p93
aVThese are little bits of individual grain of pollen
p94
aVthere and there, and here is a \u2014
p95
aVwhat you see as one little yellow dot of pollen,
p96
aVwhen you look in a microscope, it's actually made
p97
aVof thousands of little grains of pollen.
p98
aVSo this, for example, when you see bees flying around
p99
aVthese little plants, and they're collecting pollen,
p100
aVthose pollen grains that they're collecting, they pack
p101
aVinto their legs and they take it back to the hive,
p102
aVand that's what makes the beehive,
p103
aVthe wax in the beehive. And they're also collecting nectar,
p104
aVand that's what makes the honey that we eat.
p105
aa(lp106
VHere's a close-up picture, or this is actually a regular picture
p107
aVof a water hyacinth, and if you had really, really good vision,
p108
aVwith your naked eye, you'd see it about that well.
p109
aVThere's the stamen and the pistil. But look what the stamen
p110
aVand the pistil look like in a microscope. That's the stamen.
p111
aVSo that's thousands of little grains of pollen there,
p112
aVand there's the pistil there, and these are the little things
p113
aVcalled trichomes. And that's what makes the flower give
p114
aVa fragrance, and plants actually communicate
p115
aVwith one another through their fragrances.
p116
aa(lp117
VI want to talk about something really ordinary,
p118
aVjust ordinary sand.
p119
aVI became interested in sand about 10 years ago,
p120
aVwhen I first saw sand from Maui,
p121
aVand in fact, this is a little bit of sand from Maui.
p122
aVSo sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size.
p123
aVEach sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size.
p124
aVBut when you look closer at this, look at what's there.
p125
aVIt's really quite amazing. You have microshells there.
p126
aVYou have things like coral.
p127
aVYou have fragments of other shells. You have olivine.
p128
aVYou have bits of a volcano. There's a little bit
p129
aVof a volcano there. You have tube worms.
p130
aVAn amazing array of incredible things exist in sand.
p131
aVAnd the reason that is, is because in a place like this island,
p132
aVa lot of the sand is made of biological material
p133
aVbecause the reefs provide a place where all these
p134
aVmicroscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow,
p135
aVand when they die, their shells and their teeth
p136
aVand their bones break up and they make grains of sand,
p137
aVthings like coral and so forth.
p138
aVSo here's, for example, a picture of sand from Maui.
p139
aVThis is from Lahaina,
p140
aVand when we're walking along a beach, we're actually
p141
aVwalking along millions of years of biological and geological history.
p142
aVWe don't realize it, but it's actually a record
p143
aVof that entire ecology.
p144
aVSo here we see, for example, a sponge spicule,
p145
aVtwo bits of coral here,
p146
aVthat's a sea urchin spine. Really some amazing stuff.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo when I first looked at this, I was \u2014 I thought,
p149
aVgee, this is like a little treasure trove here.
p150
aVI couldn't believe it, and I'd go around dissecting
p151
aVthe little bits out and making photographs of them.
p152
aVHere's what most of the sand in our world looks like.
p153
aVThese are quartz crystals and feldspar,
p154
aVso most sand in the world on the mainland
p155
aVis made of quartz crystal and feldspar. It's the erosion of granite rock.
p156
aVSo mountains are built up, and they erode away by water
p157
aVand rain and ice and so forth,
p158
aVand they become grains of sand.
p159
aVThere's some sand that's really much more colorful.
p160
aVThese are sand from near the Great Lakes,
p161
aVand you can see that it's filled with minerals
p162
aVlike pink garnet and green epidote, all kinds of amazing stuff,
p163
aVand if you look at different sands from different places,
p164
aVevery single beach, every single place you look at sand,
p165
aVit's different. Here's from Big Sur, like they're little jewels.
p166
aVThere are places in Africa where they do the mining
p167
aVof jewels, and you go to the sand where the rivers have
p168
aVthe sand go down to the ocean, and it's like literally looking
p169
aVat tiny jewels through the microscope.
p170
aVSo every grain of sand is unique. Every beach is different.
p171
aVEvery single grain is different. There are no two grains
p172
aVof sand alike in the world.
p173
aVEvery grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere.
p174
aVThey're like a snapshot in time.
p175
aa(lp176
VNow sand is not only on Earth, but sand is
p177
aVubiquitous throughout the universe. In fact, outer space
p178
aVis filled with sand, and that sand comes together
p179
aVto make our planets and the Moon.
p180
aVAnd you can see those in micrometeorites.
p181
aVThis is some micrometeorites that the Army gave me,
p182
aVand they get these out of the drinking wells in the South Pole.
p183
aVAnd they're quite amazing-looking, and these are the
p184
aVtiny constituents that make up the world that we live in \u2014
p185
aVthe planets and the Moon.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo NASA wanted me to take some pictures of Moon sand,
p188
aVso they sent me sand from all the different landings
p189
aVof the Apollo missions that happened 40 years ago.
p190
aVAnd I started taking pictures with my three-dimensional microscopes.
p191
aVThis was the first picture I took. It was kind of amazing.
p192
aVI thought it looked kind of a little bit like the Moon, which is sort of interesting.
p193
aVNow, the way my microscopes work is, normally
p194
aVin a microscope you can see very little at one time,
p195
aVso what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope,
p196
aVkeep taking pictures, and then I have a computer program
p197
aVthat puts all those pictures together
p198
aVinto one picture so you can see actually what it looks like,
p199
aVand I do that in 3D. So there, you can see,
p200
aVis a left-eye view. There's a right-eye view.
p201
aVSo sort of left-eye view, right-eye view.
p202
aa(lp203
VNow something's interesting here. This looks very different
p204
aVthan any sand on Earth that I've ever seen, and I've
p205
aVseen a lot of sand on Earth, believe me. (Laughter)
p206
aVLook at this hole in the middle. That hole was caused
p207
aVby a micrometeorite hitting the Moon.
p208
aVNow, the Moon has no atmosphere, so micrometeorites
p209
aVcome in continuously, and the whole surface of the Moon
p210
aVis covered with powder now, because for four billion years
p211
aVit's been bombarded by micrometeorites,
p212
aVand when micrometeorites come in at about
p213
aV20 to 60,000 miles an hour, they vaporize on contact.
p214
aVAnd you can see here that that is \u2014
p215
aVthat's sort of vaporized, and that material is holding this
p216
aVlittle clump of little sand grains together.
p217
aVThis is a very small grain of sand, this whole thing.
p218
aVAnd that's called a ring agglutinate.
p219
aVAnd many of the grains of sand on the Moon look like that,
p220
aVand you'd never find that on Earth.
p221
aVMost of the sand on the Moon,
p222
aVespecially \u2014 and you know when you look at the Moon,
p223
aVthere's the dark areas and the light areas. The dark areas
p224
aVare lava flows. They're basaltic lava flows,
p225
aVand that's what this sand looks like, very similar
p226
aVto the sand that you would see in Haleakala.
p227
aVOther sands, when these micrometeorites come in,
p228
aVthey vaporize and they make these fountains,
p229
aVthese microscopic fountains that go up into the \u2014
p230
aVI was going to say "up into the air," but there is no air \u2014
p231
aVgoes sort of up, and these microscopic glass beads
p232
aVare formed instantly, and they harden, and by the time
p233
aVthey fall down back to the surface of the Moon,
p234
aVthey have these beautiful colored glass spherules.
p235
aVAnd these are actually microscopic;
p236
aVyou need a microscope to see these.
p237
aa(lp238
VNow here's a grain of sand that is from the Moon,
p239
aVand you can see that the entire
p240
aVcrystal structure is still there.
p241
aVThis grain of sand is probably about
p242
aVthree and a half or four billion years old,
p243
aVand it's never eroded away like the way we have sand
p244
aVon Earth erodes away because of water and tumbling,
p245
aVair, and so forth. All you can see is a little bit of erosion
p246
aVdown here by the Sun, has these solar storms,
p247
aVand that's erosion by solar radiation.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo what I've been trying to tell you today is
p250
aVthings even as ordinary as a grain of sand
p251
aVcan be truly extraordinary if you look closely
p252
aVand if you look from a different and a new point of view.
p253
aVI think that this was best put by William Blake when he said,
p254
aV"To see a world in a grain of sand
p255
aVand a heaven in a wild flower,
p256
aVhold infinity in the palm of your hand,
p257
aVand eternity in an hour."
p258
aVThank you. (Applause)
