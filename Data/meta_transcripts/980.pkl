VI was informed by this kind of
p4
aVunoriginal and trite idea
p5
aVthat new technologies were an opportunity
p6
aVfor social transformation,
p7
aVwhich is what drove me then,
p8
aVand still, it's a delusion that drives me now.
p9
aVI wanted to update what I've been doing since then \u2014
p10
aVbut it's still the same theme song \u2014
p11
aVand introduce you to my lab and current work,
p12
aVwhich is the Environmental Health Clinic
p13
aVthat I run at NYU.
p14
aVAnd what it is \u2014 it's a twist on health.
p15
aVBecause, really, what I'm trying to do now
p16
aVis redefine what counts as health.
p17
aVIt's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university,
p18
aVexcept people come to the clinic
p19
aVwith environmental health concerns,
p20
aVand they walk out with prescriptions
p21
aVfor things they can do to improve environmental health,
p22
aVas opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns
p23
aVand walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals.
p24
aa(lp25
VIt's a handy-dandy quote from Hippocrates of the Hippocratic oath
p26
aVthat says, "The greater part of the soul lays outside the body,
p27
aVtreatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer."
p28
aVBut that suggests the issue
p29
aVthat I'm trying to get at here,
p30
aVthat we have an opportunity to redefine what is health.
p31
aVBecause this idea that health is internal
p32
aVand atomized and individual
p33
aVand pharmaceutical
p34
aVis largely an error.
p35
aVAnd I would use this study,
p36
aVa recent study by Philip Landrigan,
p37
aVto motivate a different view of health,
p38
aVwhere he went to most of the pediatricians in Manhattan
p39
aVand the New York area
p40
aVand logged what they spent their patient hours on.
p41
aV80 to 90 percent of their time
p42
aVwas spent on five things.
p43
aVNumber one was asthma,
p44
aVnumber two was developmental delays,
p45
aVnumber three was 400-fold increases
p46
aVin rare childhood cancers
p47
aVin the last eight to 10, 15 years.
p48
aVNumber four and five were childhood obesity
p49
aVand diabetes-related issues.
p50
aVSo all of those \u2014 what's common about all of those?
p51
aVThe environment is implicated, radically implicated, right.
p52
aVThis is not the germs
p53
aVthat medicos were trained to deal with;
p54
aVthis is a different definition of health,
p55
aVhealth that has a great advantage
p56
aVbecause it's external, it's shared,
p57
aVwe can do something about it,
p58
aVas opposed to internal, genetically predetermined
p59
aVor individualized.
p60
aa(lp61
VPeople who come to the clinic are called, not patients,
p62
aVbut impatients,
p63
aVbecause they're too impatient to wait for legislative change
p64
aVto address local and environmental health issues.
p65
aVAnd I meet them at the University, I also have a few field offices
p66
aVthat I set up in various places
p67
aVthat provide an immersion
p68
aVin some of the environmental challenges we face.
p69
aVI like this one from the Belgian field office,
p70
aVwhere we met in a roundabout,
p71
aVprecisely because the roundabout iconified
p72
aVthe headless social movement
p73
aVthat informs much social transformation,
p74
aVas opposed to the top-down control
p75
aVof red light traffic intersections.
p76
aVIn this case, of course, the roundabout
p77
aVwith that micro-decisions being made in situ
p78
aVby people not being told what to do.
p79
aVBut, of course, affords greater throughput,
p80
aVfewer accidents,
p81
aVand an interesting model of social movement.
p82
aa(lp83
VSome of the things that the monitoring protocols have developed:
p84
aVthis is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol,
p85
aVor keeping tabs, if you will.
p86
aVWhat they are is an addition of tadpoles
p87
aVthat are named after a local bureaucrat
p88
aVwhose decisions affect your water quality.
p89
aVSo an impatient concerned for water quality
p90
aVwould raise a tadpole bureaucrat
p91
aVin a sample of water in which they're interested.
p92
aVAnd we give them a couple of things to do that,
p93
aVto help them do companion animal devices
p94
aVwhile they're blogging and doing their email.
p95
aVThis is a tadpole walker
p96
aVto take your tadpole walking in the evening.
p97
aVAnd the interesting thing that happens \u2014
p98
aVbecause we're using tadpoles, of course,
p99
aVbecause they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have,
p100
aVseveral orders of magnitude more sensitive
p101
aVthan some of our senses
p102
aVfor sensing,
p103
aVresponding in a biologically meaningful way,
p104
aVto that whole class of industrial contaminants
p105
aVwe call endocrine disruptors
p106
aVor hormone emulators.
p107
aa(lp108
VBut by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening \u2014
p109
aVthere's a few action shots \u2014
p110
aVyour neighbors are likely to say, "What are you doing?"
p111
aVAnd then you have to introduce your tadpole
p112
aVand who it's named after.
p113
aVYou have to explain what you're doing
p114
aVand how the developmental events of a tadpole
p115
aVare, of course, very observable
p116
aVand they use the same T3-mediated hormones that we do.
p117
aVAnd so next time your neighbor sees you
p118
aVthey'll say, "How is that tadpole doing?"
p119
aVAnd you can let them social network with your tadpole,
p120
aVbecause the Environmental Health Clinic has a social networking site
p121
aVfor, not only impatients, humans,
p122
aVbut non-humans,
p123
aVsocial networking for humans and non-humans.
p124
aVAnd of course, these endocrine disruptors
p125
aVare things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic,
p126
aVthe obesity epidemic,
p127
aVthe two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls
p128
aVand other related things.
p129
aVThe culmination of this is if you've successfully raised your tadpole,
p130
aVobserving the behavioral
p131
aVand developmental events,
p132
aVyou will then go and introduce your tadpole
p133
aVto its namesake
p134
aVand discuss the evidence that you've seen.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnother quick protocol \u2014 and I'm going to go through these quickly,
p137
aVbut just to give you the material sense of what we're doing here \u2014
p138
aVinstead of asking you for urine samples,
p139
aVI'll ask you for a mouse sample.
p140
aVAnyone here lucky enough to share, to cohabit with a mouse \u2014
p141
aVa domestic partnership with mice?
p142
aVVery lucky.
p143
aVMice, of course, are the quintessential
p144
aVmodel organism.
p145
aVThey're even better models of environmental health,
p146
aVbecause not only the same mammalian biology,
p147
aVbut they share your diet, largely.
p148
aVThey share your environmental stressors,
p149
aVthe asbestos levels and lead levels,
p150
aVwhatever you're exposed to.
p151
aVAnd they're geographically more limited than you are,
p152
aVbecause we don't know if you've been exposed
p153
aVto persistent organic pollutants
p154
aVin your home, or occupationally
p155
aVor as a child.
p156
aVMice are a very good representation.
p157
aVSo it starts by building a better mousetrap, of course.
p158
aVThis is one of them.
p159
aa(lp160
VCoping with environmental stressors is tricky.
p161
aVIs anybody here on antidepressants?
p162
aV(Laughter)
p163
aVThere's a lot of people in Manhattan are.
p164
aVAnd we were testing if the mice
p165
aVwould also self-administer SSRIs.
p166
aVSo this was Prozac, this was Zoloft,
p167
aVthis was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant,
p168
aVall of which were the medications that the impatient was taking.
p169
aVSo do you think the mice
p170
aVself-administered antidepressants?
p171
aVWhat's the \u2014 (Audience: Sure. Yes.)
p172
aVHow did you know that? They did.
p173
aVThis was vodka and solution, gin and solution.
p174
aVThis guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant.
p175
aVWhere's our expert?
p176
aVVodka, gin \u2014
p177
aV(Audience: [unclear])
p178
aVYes. Yes. You know your mice well.
p179
aVThey did, yes.
p180
aVSo they drank as much vodka as they did plain water,
p181
aVwhich was interesting.
p182
aVThen of course, it goes into the entrapment device.
p183
aVThere's an old cellphone in there \u2014 a good use for old cellphones \u2014
p184
aVwhich dials the clinic, we go and pick up the mouse.
p185
aVWe take the blood sample
p186
aVand do the blood work and hair work on the mice.
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd I want to sort of point out the big advantage
p189
aVof framing health in this external way.
p190
aVBut we do have a few prescription products through this.
p191
aVIt's very different from the medical model.
p192
aVAnything you do to improve your water quality or air quality,
p193
aVor to understand it or to change it,
p194
aVthe benefits are enjoyed by anyone
p195
aVyou share that water quality or air quality with.
p196
aVAnd that aggregating effect,
p197
aVthat collective action effect,
p198
aVis actually something we can use to our advantage.
p199
aVSo I want to show you one prescription product in the clinic
p200
aVcalled the No Park.
p201
aVThis is a prescription to improve water quality.
p202
aVMany impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality.
p203
aVWhat we do is we take a fire hydrant,
p204
aVa "no parking" space associated with a fire hydrant,
p205
aVand we prescribe the removal of the asphalt
p206
aVto create an engineered micro landscape,
p207
aVto create an infiltration opportunity.
p208
aa(lp209
VBecause, many of you will know,
p210
aVthat the biggest pollution burden
p211
aVthat we have on the New York, New Jersey harbor right now
p212
aVis no longer the point sources,
p213
aVno longer the big polluters,
p214
aVno longer the GEs,
p215
aVbut that massive network of roads,
p216
aV[those] impervious surfaces,
p217
aVthat collect all that cadmium neurotoxin that comes from your brake liners
p218
aVor the oily hydrocarbon waste
p219
aVin every single storm event and medieval infrastructure
p220
aVwashes it straight into the estuary system.
p221
aVThat doesn't do a lot of good.
p222
aVThese are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants
p223
aVbefore they enter the harbor,
p224
aVand they're produced by impatients
p225
aVon various city blocks
p226
aVin some very interesting ways.
p227
aVI just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though,
p228
aVthere's about two or three fire hydrants
p229
aVon every city block.
p230
aVBy creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them,
p231
aVwe don't prevent them from being used
p232
aVas emergency vehicle parking spaces,
p233
aVbecause, of course, a firetruck can come and park there.
p234
aVThey flatten a few plants. No big deal, they'll regenerate.
p235
aVBut if we did this
p236
aVin every single \u2014
p237
aVevery fire hydrant
p238
aVwe could redefine the emergency.
p239
aVThat 99 percent of the time
p240
aVwhen a firetruck is not parking there,
p241
aVit's infiltrating pollutants.
p242
aVIt's also increasing fixing CO2s,
p243
aVsequestering some of the airborne pollutants.
p244
aVAnd aggregated,
p245
aVthese smaller interceptions
p246
aVcould actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution
p247
aVthat now runs into the estuary system,
p248
aVup to a seven inch rain event, up to a hundred-year storm.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo these are small actions
p251
aVthat can amount to a significant effect
p252
aVto improve local environmental health.
p253
aVThis is one of the more ambitious ones.
p254
aVWhat the climate crisis has revealed to us
p255
aVis a secondary, more insidious
p256
aVand more pervasive crisis,
p257
aVwhich is the crisis of agency,
p258
aVwhich is what to do.
p259
aVSomehow buying a local lettuce, changing a light bulb,
p260
aVdriving the speed limit, changing your tires regularly,
p261
aVdoesn't seem sufficient
p262
aVin the face of climate crisis.
p263
aVAnd this is an interesting icon that happened \u2014
p264
aVyou remember these: fallout shelters.
p265
aVWhat is the fallout shelter
p266
aVfor the climate crisis?
p267
aVThis was civic mobilization.
p268
aVChurches, school groups,
p269
aVhospitals, private residents \u2014
p270
aVeveryone built one of these in a matter of months.
p271
aVAnd they still remain
p272
aVas icons of civic response
p273
aVin the face of shared, uncertain, collective threat.
p274
aa(lp275
VFallout shelter for the climate crisis,
p276
aVI would say, looks something like this, or this,
p277
aVwhich is an intensive urban agriculture facility
p278
aVthat's due to go on my lab building at NYU.
p279
aVWhat it does
p280
aVis a very simple idea
p281
aVof taking \u2014
p282
aV80 to 90 percent of the CO2 produced in Manhattan
p283
aVis building related \u2014
p284
aVwe take, just like a commercial greenhouse,
p285
aVwe take the CO2 from the building \u2014
p286
aVCO2-enriched air \u2014
p287
aVwe force it through the urban agriculture facility,
p288
aVand then we resupply oxygen-enriched air.
p289
aVYou can't actually build much on a roof, they're not designed for that.
p290
aVSo it's on legs,
p291
aVso it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns.
p292
aVIt's built as a barn raising,
p293
aVusing open source hardware.
p294
aVThis is the quarter-scale prototype
p295
aVthat was functioning in Spain.
p296
aVThis is what it will look like, fingers crossed,
p297
aVNYU willing.
p298
aa(lp299
VAnd what I want to show you is \u2014
p300
aVactually this is one of the components of it that we've just recently been testing \u2014
p301
aVwhich is a solar chimney \u2014
p302
aVwe have got 17 of them now put around New York at the moment \u2014
p303
aVthat passively draws air up.
p304
aVYou understand a solar chimney.
p305
aVHot air rises.
p306
aVYou put a bit of black plastic on the side of a building,
p307
aVit'll heat up, and you'll get passive airflow.
p308
aVWhat we do is actually
p309
aVput a standard HVAC filter on the top of that.
p310
aVThat actually removes about 95 percent
p311
aVof the carbon black,
p312
aVthat stuff that, with ozone,
p313
aVis responsible for about half of global warming's effects,
p314
aVbecause it changes, it settles on the snow,
p315
aVit changes the reflectors,
p316
aVit changes
p317
aVthe transmission qualities of the atmosphere.
p318
aVCarbon black is that grime
p319
aVthat otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs,
p320
aVand it's associated with.
p321
aVIt's not good stuff, and it's from inefficient combustion,
p322
aVnot from combustion itself.
p323
aVWhen we put it through our solar chimney,
p324
aVwe remove actually about 95 percent of that.
p325
aVAnd then I swap it out
p326
aVwith the students
p327
aVand actually re-release that carbon black.
p328
aVAnd we make pencils the length of which measures the grime
p329
aVthat we've pulled out of the air.
p330
aVHere's one of them that we have up now.
p331
aVHere's who put them up and who are avid pencil users.
p332
aa(lp333
VOkay, so I want to show you
p334
aVjust two more interfaces,
p335
aVbecause I think one of our big challenges
p336
aVis re-imagining our relationship to natural systems,
p337
aVnot only through this model
p338
aVof twisted personalized health,
p339
aVbut through the animals
p340
aVwith whom we cohabit.
p341
aVWe are not alone; the animals are moving in.
p342
aVIn fact, urban migration now describes
p343
aVthe movement of animals formerly known as wild
p344
aVinto urban centers.
p345
aVYou know, coyote in Central Park, a whale in the Gowanus Canal,
p346
aVelk in Westchester County.
p347
aVIt's happening all over the Developed World,
p348
aVprobably for loss of habitat,
p349
aVbut also because our cities are a little bit more livable
p350
aVthan they have been.
p351
aVAnd every green space we create
p352
aVis an invitation for non-humans to cohabit with us.
p353
aVBut we've kind of lacked imagination
p354
aVin how we could do that well or interestingly.
p355
aVAnd I want to show you a few of the technological interfaces
p356
aVthat have been developed under the moniker of OOZ \u2014
p357
aVwhich is zoo backwards and without cages \u2014
p358
aVto try and reform
p359
aVthat relationship.
p360
aVThis is communication technology for birds. It looks like this.
p361
aVWhen a bird lands on it, they trigger a sound file.
p362
aVThis is actually in the Whitney Museum, where there were six of them,
p363
aVeach of which had a different argument on it,
p364
aVdifferent sound file.
p365
aVThey said things like this.
p366
aa(lp367
V(Whistling)
p368
aa(lp369
VRecorded Voice: Here's what you need to do.
p370
aVGo down there and buy some of those health food bars,
p371
aVthe ones you call bird food,
p372
aVand bring it here and scatter it around.
p373
aVThere's a good person.
p374
aa(lp375
VNatalie Jeremijenko: Okay. (Laugher)
p376
aVSo there was several of these.
p377
aVThe birds were able to jump from one to the other.
p378
aVThese are just your average urban pigeon.
p379
aVAnd an early test
p380
aVwhich argument elicited cooperative behavior
p381
aVfrom the people below \u2014
p382
aVabout a hundred to one
p383
aVdecided that this was the argument
p384
aVthat worked best on us.
p385
aa(lp386
VRecorded Voice: Tick, tick, tick.
p387
aVThat's the sound of genetic mutations
p388
aVof the avian flu
p389
aVbecoming a deadly human flu.
p390
aVDo you know what slows it down?
p391
aVHealthy sub-populations of birds,
p392
aVincreasing biodiversity generally.
p393
aVIt is in your interests that I'm healthy,
p394
aVhappy, well-fed.
p395
aVHence, you could share some of your nutritional resources
p396
aVinstead of monopolizing them.
p397
aVThat is, share your lunch.
p398
aa(lp399
V(Laughter)
p400
aa(lp401
VNJ: It worked, and it's true.
p402
aVThe final project I'd like to show you
p403
aVis a new interface for fish
p404
aVthat has just been launched \u2014
p405
aVit's actually officially launched next week \u2014
p406
aVwith a wonderful commission from the Architectural League.
p407
aVYou may not have known that you need to communicate with fish,
p408
aVbut there is now a device for you to do so.
p409
aVIt looks like this: buoys that float on the water,
p410
aVproject three foot up, three foot down.
p411
aVWhen a fish swims underneath, a light goes on.
p412
aVThis is what it looks like.
p413
aVSo there's another function on here.
p414
aVThis top light is \u2014 I'm sorry if I'm making you seasick \u2014
p415
aVthis top light is actually a water quality display
p416
aVthat shifts from red, when the dissolved oxygen is low,
p417
aVto a blue/green, when its dissolved oxygen is high.
p418
aVAnd then you can also text the fish.
p419
aVSo there's business cards down there
p420
aVthat'll give you contact details.
p421
aVAnd they text back.
p422
aVWhen the buoys get your text, they wink at you twice to say, we've got your message.
p423
aVBut perhaps the most popular has been
p424
aVthat we've got another array of these boys in the Bronx River,
p425
aVwhere the first beaver \u2014
p426
aVcrazy as he is \u2014
p427
aVto have moved in and built a lodge in New York
p428
aVin 250 years, hangs out.
p429
aVSo updates from a beaver.
p430
aVYou can subscribe to updates from him. You can talk to him.
p431
aa(lp432
VAnd what I like to think of
p433
aVis this is an interface
p434
aVthat re-scripts how we interact with natural systems,
p435
aVspecifically by changing who has information,
p436
aVwhere they have it,
p437
aVwho can make sense of that information,
p438
aVand what you can do about it.
p439
aVIn this case, instead of throwing chewing gum,
p440
aVor Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish \u2014
p441
aVThere's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with
p442
aVthat's in the middle of the city,
p443
aVand the largest pollution burden on it
p444
aVis not the roadborne pollution,
p445
aVit's actually white bread
p446
aVfrom people feeding the fish and the birds.
p447
aVInstead of doing that actually, we've developed some fish sticks
p448
aVthat you can feed the fish.
p449
aVThey're delicious.
p450
aVThey're cross-species delicious that is,
p451
aVdelicious for humans and non-humans.
p452
aVBut they also have a chelating agent in them.
p453
aVThey're nutritionally appropriate,
p454
aVnot like Doritos.
p455
aVAnd so every time
p456
aVthat desire to interact with the animals,
p457
aVwhich is at least as ubiquitous
p458

aVAnd there's about three of them on every New York City park.

aVAnd Yellowstone National Park,
p461
aVthere's more "do not feed the animals" signs
p462
aVthan there are animals you might wish to feed.

aVBut in that action, that interaction,
p464
aVby re-scripting that,
p465
aVby changing it into an opportunity
p466
aVto offer food that is nutritionally appropriate,
p467
aVthat could augment the nutritional resources
p468
aVthat we ourselves have depleted
p469
aVfor augmenting the fish population
p470
aVand also adding chelating agent,
p471
aVwhich, like any chelating agent that we use medicinally,
p472
aVbinds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs
p473
aVthat are in the fish
p474
aVliving in this particular habitat
p475
aVand allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt
p476
aVwhere it's complexed by a reactive,
p477
aVeffectively removing it from bioavailability.
p478
aa(lp479
VBut I wanted to say that interaction,
p480
aVre-scripting that interaction,
p481
aVinto collective action, collective remediative action,
p482
aVvery different from the approach
p483
aVthat's being used on the other side on the Hudson River,
p484
aVwhere we're dredging the PCBs \u2014
p485
aVafter 30 years of legislative and legal struggle,
p486
aVGE's paying for the dredging
p487
aVof the largest Superfund site in the world \u2014
p488
aVwe're dredging it, and it'll probably get shipped off to Pennsylvania
p489
aVor the nearest Third World country,
p490
aVwhere it will continue to be toxic sludge.
p491
aVDisplacement is not the way to deal with environmental issues.
p492
aVAnd that's typically the paradigm
p493
aVunder which we've operated.
p494
aa(lp495
VBy actually taking the opportunity
p496
aVthat new technologies,
p497
aVnew interactive technologies, present
p498
aVto re-script our interactions,
p499
aVto script them,
p500
aVnot just as isolated, individuated interactions,
p501
aVbut as collective aggregating actions
p502
aVthat can amount to something,
p503
aVwe can really begin to address
p504
aVsome of our important environmental challenges.
