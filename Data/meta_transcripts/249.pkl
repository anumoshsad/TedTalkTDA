VIt is interesting that in the United States,
p4
aVthe most significant health-care budget
p5
aVgoes to cardiovascular disease care, whether it's private or public.
p6
aVThere's no comparison at all.
p7
aVIn Africa \u2014 where it is a major killer \u2014 it is totally ignored.
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd that situation cannot be right. We must do something about it.
p10
aVA health status of a nation parallels development of that nation.
p11
aV17 million people die every year from heart disease.
p12
aV32 million heart attacks and strokes occur.
p13
aVMost of this is in developing countries, and the majority is in Africa.
p14
aV85 percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease
p15
aVis in developing countries \u2014 not in the West \u2014
p16
aVand yet 90 percent of the resources are in the West.
p17
aa(lp18
VWho is at risk? People like you.
p19
aVIt's not just the Africans that should be concerned about that.
p20
aVAll friends of Africa, that will have reason to be in Africa at some point in time,
p21
aVshould be very concerned about this deplorable situation.
p22
aVHas anyone here wondered what will happen
p23
aVif you go back to your room at night,
p24
aVand you start getting chest pains, shortness of breath, sweating?
p25
aVYou're having a heart attack. What are you going to do?
p26
aVWill you fly back to the U.S., Germany, Europe?
p27
aVNo, you will die. 50 percent will die within 24 hours, if not treated.
p28
aa(lp29
VThis is what's going on.
p30
aVIn a look at the map of the U.S. \u2014 the graph here,
p31
aV10 million people here, 10 million here.
p32
aVBy the time you get to 50, it's almost no one left in Nigeria \u2014
p33
aVlife expectancy is 47.
p34
aVIt's not because some people don't survive childhood illnesses \u2014
p35
aVthey do \u2014 but they do not survive after the time that they reach
p36
aVabout 45 years old and 50 years old.
p37
aVAnd those are the times they're most productive.
p38
aVThose are the times that they should be contributing
p39
aVto Africa's development. But they're not there.
p40
aVThe best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents.
p41
aVIf you cannot secure the parents,
p42
aVyou cannot guarantee the security of the African child.
p43
aa(lp44
VWhat are the risk factors?
p45
aVIt's very well known. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on those.
p46
aVThese are just for information:
p47
aVhypertension, diabetes, obesity, lack of exercise. The usual suspects.
p48
aVRight here in Tanzania, 30 percent of individuals have hypertension.
p49
aV20 percent are getting treated.
p50
aVOnly less than one percent are adequately treated.
p51
aVIf we can treat hypertension alone in Africa,
p52
aVwe'll save 250,000 lives a year. That's quite significant!
p53
aa(lp54
VEasy to treat. Look at the situation in Mauritius.
p55
aVIn eight short years \u2014 we're here talking about HIV, malaria,
p56
aVwhich is all good.
p57
aVWe cannot make the mistakes we've made with malaria and HIV.
p58
aVIn eight short years, non-communicable diseases
p59
aVwill become the leading causes of death in Africa.
p60
aa(lp61
VThat is something to keep in mind. We can't deal with it with situations like this.
p62
aVThis is a typical African hospital. We can't depend on the elites \u2014
p63
aVthey go to USA, Germany, U.K. for treatment. Unbelievable.
p64
aVYou can't depend on foreign aid alone.
p65
aVHere is the situation: countries are turning inwards.
p66
aVPost-9/11, [the] United States has had a lot of trouble
p67
aVto deal with, their own internal issues.
p68
aVSo, they spend their money trying to fix those problems.
p69
aVYou can't rightly \u2014 it's not their responsibility,
p70
aVit is my responsibility. I have to take care of my own problems.
p71
aVIf they help, that's good! But that is not my expectation.
p72
aVThese worsening indices of health care or health studies in Africa
p73
aVdemand a new look. We cannot keep on doing things
p74
aVthe way we've always done them.
p75
aVIf they have not worked, we have to look for alternative solutions.
p76
aa(lp77
VI'm here to talk to you about solutions.
p78
aVThis has been \u2014 what has been a difficult sign to some of us.
p79
aVSeveral years ago, we started thinking about it.
p80
aVEveryone knows the problem. No one knows what the solutions are.
p81
aVWe decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is.
p82
aVEveryone is ready to throw in money,
p83
aVin terms of free money aid to developing countries.
p84
aVTalk about sustainable investment, no one is interested.
p85
aVYou can't raise money.
p86
aVI have done businesses in healthcare in the United States \u2014
p87
aVI live in Nashville, Tennessee, health care capital of America.
p88
aV[It's] very easy to raise money for health-care ventures.
p89
aVBut start telling them, you know,
p90
aVwe're going to try to do it in Nigeria \u2014 everyone runs away.
p91
aVThat is totally wrong. Those of you in the audience here,
p92
aVif you want to help Africa, invest money in sustainable development.
p93
aa(lp94
VLet me lead you through a day in the life of the Heart Institute,
p95
aVso you get a glimpse of what we do,
p96
aVand I'll talk a little bit more about it.
p97
aVWhat we have done is to show that high-quality health care,
p98
aVcomparable to the best anywhere in the world,
p99
aVcan be done in a developing country environment.
p100
aVWe have 25 positions right now \u2014 all of them trained,
p101
aVboard certified in the USA, Canada or Britain.
p102
aVWe have every modality that can be done in Vanderbilt,
p103
aVCleveland Clinic \u2014 everywhere in the U.S. \u2014
p104
aVand we do it for about 10 percent of the cost
p105
aVthat you will need to do those things in the United States.
p106
aV(Applause)
p107
aa(lp108
VAdditionally, we have a policy
p109
aVthat no one is ever turned away because of ability to pay.
p110
aVWe take care of everyone.
p111
aV(Applause)
p112
aVWhether you have one dollar, two dollars \u2014 it doesn't matter.
p113
aVAnd I will tell you how we're able to do it.
p114
aa(lp115
VWe make sure that we select our equipment properly.
p116
aVWe go for modular units. Units that have multi-modality functions
p117
aVhave modular components. Easy to repair, and because of that,
p118
aVwe do not take things that are not durable and cannot last.
p119
aVWe emphasize training,
p120
aVand we make sure that this process is regenerative.
p121
aVVery soon we will all be dead and gone, but the problems will stay,
p122
aVunless we have people taking over from where we stopped.
p123
aa(lp124
VWe made sure that we produced some things ourselves.
p125
aVWe do not buy unit doses of radiopharmaceuticals.
p126
aVWe get the generators from the companies.
p127
aVWe manufacture them in-house, ourselves. That keeps the costs down.
p128
aVSo, for a radiopharmaceutical in the U.S. \u2014
p129
aVthat you'll get a unit dose for 250 dollars \u2014
p130
aVwhen we're finished manufacturing it in-house,
p131
aVwe come at a price of about two dollars.
p132
aV(Applause)
p133
aa(lp134
VWe recognize that the only way to bridge the gap
p135
aVbetween the rich and poor countries
p136
aVis through education and technology.
p137
aVAll these problems we're talking about \u2014
p138
aVif we bring development, they will all disappear.
p139
aVTechnology is a great equalizer. How do we make it work?
p140
aVIt's been proved: self-care is cost-effective.
p141
aVIt extends opportunity to the rural centers,
p142
aVand we can use expertise in a very smart way.
p143
aa(lp144
VThis is the way our centers are set up.
p145
aVWe currently have three locations in the Caribbean,
p146
aVand we're planning a fourth one.
p147
aVAnd we have now decided to go into Africa.
p148
aVWe will be doing the West African Heart Institute
p149
aVin Port Harcourt, Nigeria. That project will be starting
p150
aVwithin the next few months. We hope to open in 2008-09.
p151
aVAnd we will do other centers.
p152
aVThis model can be adapted to every disease process.
p153
aVAll the units, all the centers, are linked
p154
aVthrough a switched hub to a central server,
p155
aVand all the images are populated to review stations.
p156
aVAnd we designed this telemedicine solution. It's proprietary to us,
p157
aVand we are happy to share what we have learned with anyone
p158
aVwho is interested in doing it. You can still be profitable.
p159
aa(lp160
VWe make sure that the telemedicine platform gives access
p161
aVto expert medical specialists anywhere in the world,
p162
aVjust by a click of the button.
p163
aVI'll lead you through, to see how this happens.
p164
aVThis is at the Heart Institute. The doctors from anywhere can log in.
p165
aVI can call you in Switzerland and say, "Listen, go into our system.
p166
aVLook at Mrs. Jones. Look at the study, tell me what you think."
p167
aVThey'll give me that information,
p168
aVand we'll make the care of the patient better.
p169
aVThe patient doesn't have to travel.
p170
aVHe doesn't have to experience the anxiety of not knowing
p171
aVbecause of limited expertise.
p172
aa(lp173
VWe also use [an] electronic medical record system.
p174
aVI'm happy to say that the things we have implemented \u2014
p175
aV80 percent of U.S. practices do not have them, and yet the technology is there.
p176
aVBut you know, they have that luxury.
p177
aVBecause if you can't get it in Nashville, you can travel to Birmingham,
p178
aVtwo hours away, and you'll get it. If you can't get it in Cleveland,
p179
aVyou can go to Cincinnati. We don't have that luxury,
p180
aVso we have to make it happen.
p181
aVWhen we do it, we will put the cost of care down.
p182
aVAnd we'll extend it to the rural centers and make it affordable.
p183
aVAnd everyone will get the care they deserve.
p184
aa(lp185
VIt cannot just be technology, we recognize that.
p186
aVPrevention must be part of the solution \u2014 we emphasize that.
p187
aVBut, you know, you have to tell people what can be done.
p188
aVIt's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive,
p189
aVand they go home and can't do it.
p190
aVThey need to be alive, they need to feed.
p191
aVWe recommend exercise as the most effective, simple, easy thing to do.
p192
aVWe have had walks every year \u2014 every March, April.
p193
aVWe form people into groups and make them go into challenges.
p194
aVWhich group loses the most weight, we give them prizes.
p195
aVWhich groups record more walking distance by pedometer,
p196
aVwe give them prizes. We do this constantly.
p197
aVWe encourage them to bring children.
p198
aVThat way we start exposing the children from very early on,
p199
aVon what these issues are. Because once they learn it,
p200
aa(lp201
Vthey will stay with it. In doing this we have created
p202
aVat least 100 skilled jobs in Jamaica alone,
p203
aVand these are physicians with expertise and special training.
p204
aVWe have taken care of over 1,000 indigent patients that could have died,
p205
aVincluding four free pacemakers in patients
p206
aVwith complete heart block. For those that understand cardiology,
p207
aVcomplete heart block means certain death.
p208
aVIf you don't get this pacemaker, you will be dead.
p209
aVSo we are pleased with that.
p210
aa(lp211
VIndirectly, we have saved the government of Jamaica five million dollars
p212
aVfrom people that would have gone to Miami or Atlanta for care.
p213
aVAnd we've hopefully saved a lot of lives.
p214
aVBy the end of this year, we would have contributed over one million dollars
p215
aVin indigent care. In the first four months, it's been 340,000 dollars,
p216
aVaveraging 85,000 dollars a month. The government will not do that,
p217
aVbecause they have competing needs.
p218
aVThey need to put resources elsewhere. But we can still do it.
p219
aVPeople say, "How can you do that?" This is how we can do that.
p220
aVAt least 4,000 rich Jamaicans that were heading to Miami for treatment
p221
aVhave self-confessed that they did not go to Miami
p222
aVbecause of the Heart Institute of the Caribbean.
p223
aVAnd, if they went to Miami, they will spend significantly more \u2014
p224
aVeight to 10 times more. And they feel happy spending it at home,
p225
aVgetting the same quality of care.
p226
aVAnd for that money \u2014 for every one patient that has the money to pay,
p227
aVit gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people
p228
aVthat do not have the resources to pay.
p229
aV(Applause)
p230
aa(lp231
VFor this to work, this progress must be sustainable.
p232
aVSo, we emphasize training. Training is critical.
p233
aVWe have gone further: we have formed a relationship
p234
aVwith the University of Technology, Jamaica,
p235
aVwhere I now have an appointment.
p236
aVAnd we are starting a biomedical engineering program,
p237
aVso that we will train people locally, who can repair that equipment.
p238
aVThat way we're not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues.
p239
aVWe're also starting ancillary health-care technology training programs \u2014
p240
aVtraining people in echocardiography, cardiac ultrasound,
p241
aVthose kinds of things. Now, with that kind of training,
p242
aVit gives people motivation.
p243
aVBecause now they will get a bachelors degree in medical imaging
p244
aVand all that kind of stuff. In the process, I want you to just hear
p245
aVfrom the trainees themselves what it has meant for them.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Video) Dr. Jason Topping: My name is Jason Topping.
p248
aVI'm a senior resident in anesthesia in intensive care
p249
aVat the University Hospital of the West Indies.
p250
aVI came to the Heart Institute in 2006,
p251
aVas part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program.
p252
aVI spent three months at the Heart Institute.
p253
aVThere's been no doubt around my colleagues
p254
aVabout the utility of the training I received here,
p255
aVand I think there's been an increased interest now in \u2014
p256
aVparticularly in echocardiography and its use in our setting.
p257
aa(lp258
VSharon Lazarus: I am an echocardiographer at the Heart Institute of the Caribbean,
p259
aVsince the past two years. I received training at this institution.
p260
aVI think this aspect of training in cardiology
p261
aVthat the Heart Institute of the Caribbean has introduced in Jamaica
p262
aVis very important in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases.
p263
aa(lp264
VErnest Madu: The lesson in this is that it can be done, and it can be sustained,
p265
aVand you can make it possible for everyone.
p266
aVWho are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care?
p267
aVWhen have you been appointed to play God?
p268
aVIt is not my decision. My job is to make sure that every person,
p269
aVno matter what fate has assigned to you, will have the opportunity
p270
aVto get the best quality health care in life.
p271
aVNext stop is West African Heart Institute,
p272
aVthat we are going to be doing in Port Harcourt, Nigeria,
p273
aVas I said before. We will do other centers across West Africa.
p274
aVWe will extend the same system into other areas,
p275
aVlike dialysis treatment.
p276
aVAnd anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation,
p277
aVwe will be happy to assist you and tell you how we've done it,
p278
aa(lp279
Vand how you can do it. If we do this,
p280
aVwe can change the face of health care in Africa.
p281
aVAfrica has been good to us; it is time for us to give back to Africa.
p282
aVI am going. Those who want to come,
p283
aVI welcome you to come along with me.
p284
aVThank you.
