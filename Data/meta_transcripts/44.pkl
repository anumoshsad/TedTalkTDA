VI want to talk today about \u2014
p4
aVI've been asked to take the long view, and I'm going to tell you what
p5
aVI think are the three biggest problems for humanity
p6
aVfrom this long point of view.
p7
aVSome of these have already been touched upon by other speakers,
p8
aVwhich is encouraging.
p9
aVIt seems that there's not just one person
p10
aVwho thinks that these problems are important.
p11
aa(lp12
VThe first is \u2014 death is a big problem.
p13
aVIf you look at the statistics,
p14
aVthe odds are not very favorable to us.
p15
aVSo far, most people who have lived have also died.
p16
aVRoughly 90 percent of everybody who has been alive has died by now.
p17
aVSo the annual death rate adds up to 150,000 \u2014
p18
aVsorry, the daily death rate \u2014 150,000 people per day,
p19
aVwhich is a huge number by any standard.
p20
aVThe annual death rate, then, becomes 56 million.
p21
aVIf we just look at the single, biggest cause of death \u2014 aging \u2014
p22
aVit accounts for roughly two-thirds of all human people who die.
p23
aVThat adds up to an annual death toll
p24
aVof greater than the population of Canada.
p25
aVSometimes, we don't see a problem
p26
aVbecause either it's too familiar or it's too big.
p27
aVCan't see it because it's too big.
p28
aVI think death might be both too familiar and too big
p29
aVfor most people to see it as a problem.
p30
aa(lp31
VOnce you think about it, you see this is not statistical points;
p32
aVthese are \u2014 let's see, how far have I talked?
p33
aVI've talked for three minutes.
p34
aVSo that would be, roughly, 324 people have died since I've begun speaking.
p35
aVPeople like \u2014 it's roughly the population in this room has just died.
p36
aVNow, the human cost of that is obvious,
p37
aVonce you start to think about it \u2014 the suffering, the loss \u2014
p38
aVit's also, economically, enormously wasteful.
p39
aVI just look at the information, and knowledge, and experience
p40
aVthat is lost due to natural causes of death in general,
p41
aVand aging, in particular.
p42
aa(lp43
VSuppose we approximated one person with one book?
p44
aVNow, of course, this is an underestimation.
p45
aVA person's lifetime of learning and experience
p46
aVis a lot more than you could put into a single book.
p47
aVBut let's suppose we did this.
p48
aV52 million people die of natural causes each year
p49
aVcorresponds, then, to 52 million volumes destroyed.
p50
aVLibrary of Congress holds 18 million volumes.
p51
aVWe are upset about the burning of the Library of Alexandria.
p52
aVIt's one of the great cultural tragedies
p53
aVthat we remember, even today.
p54
aVBut this is the equivalent of three Libraries of Congress \u2014
p55
aVburnt down, forever lost \u2014 each year.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo that's the first big problem.
p58
aVAnd I wish Godspeed to Aubrey de Grey,
p59
aVand other people like him,
p60
aVto try to do something about this as soon as possible.
p61
aVExistential risk \u2014 the second big problem.
p62
aVExistential risk is a threat to human survival, or to the long-term potential of our species.
p63
aVNow, why do I say that this is a big problem?
p64
aVWell, let's first look at the probability \u2014
p65
aVand this is very, very difficult to estimate \u2014
p66
aVbut there have been only four studies on this in recent years,
p67
aVwhich is surprising.
p68
aVYou would think that it would be of some interest
p69
aVto try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big,
p70
aVbut it's a very neglected area.
p71
aa(lp72
VBut there have been four studies \u2014
p73
aVone by John Lesley, wrote a book on this.
p74
aVHe estimated a probability that we will fail
p75
aVto survive the current century: 50 percent.
p76
aVSimilarly, the Astronomer Royal, whom we heard speak yesterday,
p77
aValso has a 50 percent probability estimate.
p78
aVAnother author doesn't give any numerical estimate,
p79
aVbut says the probability is significant that it will fail.
p80
aVI wrote a long paper on this.
p81
aVI said assigning a less than 20 percent probability would be a mistake
p82
aVin light of the current evidence we have.
p83
aVNow, the exact figures here,
p84
aVwe should take with a big grain of salt,
p85
aVbut there seems to be a consensus that the risk is substantial.
p86
aVEverybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees.
p87
aa(lp88
VNow, if we think about what just reducing
p89
aVthe probability of human extinction by just one percentage point \u2014
p90
aVnot very much \u2014 so that's equivalent to 60 million lives saved,
p91
aVif we just count the currently living people, the current generation.
p92
aVNow one percent of six billion people is equivalent to 60 million.
p93
aVSo that's a large number.
p94
aVIf we were to take into account future generations
p95
aVthat will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up,
p96
aVthen the figure becomes astronomical.
p97
aVIf we could eventually colonize a chunk of the universe \u2014
p98
aVthe Virgo supercluster \u2014
p99
aVmaybe it will take us 100 million years to get there,
p100
aVbut if we go extinct we never will.
p101
aVThen, even a one percentage point reduction
p102
aVin the extinction risk could be equivalent
p103
aVto this astronomical number \u2014 10 to the power of 32.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo if you take into account future generations as much as our own,
p106
aVevery other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant.
p107
aVThe only thing you should focus on
p108
aVwould be to reduce existential risk
p109
aVbecause even the tiniest decrease in existential risk
p110
aVwould just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve.
p111
aVAnd even if you just look at the current people,
p112
aVand ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct,
p113
aVit should still have a high priority.
p114
aVNow, let me spend the rest of my time on the third big problem,
p115
aVbecause it's more subtle and perhaps difficult to grasp.
p116
aVThink about some time in your life \u2014
p117
aVsome people might never have experienced it \u2014 but some people,
p118
aVthere are just those moments that you have experienced
p119
aVwhere life was fantastic.
p120
aa(lp121
VIt might have been at the moment of some great, creative inspiration
p122
aVyou might have had when you just entered this flow stage.
p123
aVOr when you understood something you had never done before.
p124
aVOr perhaps in the ecstasy of romantic love.
p125
aVOr an aesthetic experience \u2014 a sunset or a great piece of art.
p126
aVEvery once in a while we have these moments,
p127
aVand we realize just how good life can be when it's at its best.
p128
aVAnd you wonder, why can't it be like that all the time?
p129
aVYou just want to cling onto this.
p130
aVAnd then, of course, it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades.
p131
aVAnd it's really difficult to recall, in a normal frame of mind,
p132
aVjust how good life can be at its best.
p133
aVOr how bad it can be at its worst.
p134
aa(lp135
VThe third big problem is that life isn't usually
p136
aVas wonderful as it could be.
p137
aVI think that's a big, big problem.
p138
aVIt's easy to say what we don't want.
p139
aVHere are a number of things that we don't want \u2014
p140
aVillness, involuntary death, unnecessary suffering, cruelty,
p141
aVstunted growth, memory loss, ignorance, absence of creativity.
p142
aVSuppose we fixed these things \u2014 we did something about all of these.
p143
aVWe were very successful.
p144
aVWe got rid of all of these things.
p145
aVWe might end up with something like this,
p146
aVwhich is \u2014 I mean, it's a heck of a lot better than that.
p147
aVBut is this really the best we can dream of?
p148
aVIs this the best we can do?
p149
aa(lp150
VOr is it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring to work towards?
p151
aVAnd if we think about this,
p152
aVI think it's very clear that there are ways
p153
aVin which we could change things, not just by eliminating negatives,
p154
aVbut adding positives.
p155
aVOn my wish list, at least, would be:
p156
aVmuch longer, healthier lives, greater subjective well-being,
p157
aVenhanced cognitive capacities, more knowledge and understanding,
p158
aVunlimited opportunity for personal growth
p159
aVbeyond our current biological limits, better relationships,
p160
aVan unbounded potential for spiritual, moral
p161
aVand intellectual development.
p162
aa(lp163
VIf we want to achieve this, what, in the world, would have to change?
p164
aVAnd this is the answer \u2014 we would have to change.
p165
aVNot just the world around us, but we, ourselves.
p166
aVNot just the way we think about the world, but the way we are \u2014 our very biology.
p167
aVHuman nature would have to change.
p168
aVNow, when we think about changing human nature,
p169
aVthe first thing that comes to mind
p170
aVare these human modification technologies \u2014
p171
aVgrowth hormone therapy, cosmetic surgery,
p172
aVstimulants like Ritalin, Adderall, anti-depressants,
p173
aVanabolic steroids, artificial hearts.
p174
aVIt's a pretty pathetic list.
p175
aVThey do great things for a few people
p176
aVwho suffer from some specific condition,
p177
aVbut for most people, they don't really transform
p178
aVwhat it is to be human.
p179
aVAnd they also all seem a little bit \u2014
p180
aVmost people have this instinct that, well, sure,
p181
aVthere needs to be anti-depressants for the really depressed people.
p182
aVBut there's a kind of queasiness
p183
aVthat these are unnatural in some way.
p184
aa(lp185
VIt's worth recalling that there are a lot of other
p186
aVmodification technologies and enhancement technologies that we use.
p187
aVWe have skin enhancements, clothing.
p188
aVAs far as I can see, all of you are users of this
p189
aVenhancement technology in this room, so that's a great thing.
p190
aVMood modifiers have been used from time immemorial \u2014
p191
aVcaffeine, alcohol, nicotine, immune system enhancement,
p192
aVvision enhancement, anesthetics \u2014
p193
aVwe take that very much for granted,
p194
aVbut just think about how great progress that is \u2014
p195
aVlike, having an operation before anesthetics was not fun.
p196
aVContraceptives, cosmetics and brain reprogramming techniques \u2014
p197
aVthat sounds ominous,
p198
aa(lp199
Vbut the distinction between what is a technology \u2014
p200
aVa gadget would be the archetype \u2014
p201
aVand other ways of changing and rewriting human nature is quite subtle.
p202
aVSo if you think about what it means to learn arithmetic or to learn to read,
p203
aVyou're actually, literally rewriting your own brain.
p204
aVYou're changing the microstructure of your brain as you go along.
p205
aVSo in a broad sense, we don't need to think about technology
p206
aVas only little gadgets, like these things here,
p207
aVbut even institutions and techniques,
p208
aVpsychological methods and so forth.
p209
aVForms of organization can have a profound impact on human nature.
p210
aa(lp211
VLooking ahead, there is a range of technologies
p212
aVthat are almost certain to be developed sooner or later.
p213
aVWe are very ignorant about what the time scale for these things are,
p214
aVbut they all are consistent with everything we know
p215
aVabout physical laws, laws of chemistry, etc.
p216
aVIt's possible to assume,
p217
aVsetting aside a possibility of catastrophe,
p218
aVthat sooner or later we will develop all of these.
p219
aVAnd even just a couple of these would be enough
p220
aVto transform the human condition.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo let's look at some of the dimensions of human nature
p223
aVthat seem to leave room for improvement.
p224
aVHealth span is a big and urgent thing,
p225
aVbecause if you're not alive,
p226
aVthen all the other things will be to little avail.
p227
aVIntellectual capacity \u2014 let's take that box,
p228
aVwhich falls into a lot of different sub-categories:
p229
aVmemory, concentration, mental energy, intelligence, empathy.
p230
aVThese are really great things.
p231
aVPart of the reason why we value these traits
p232
aVis that they make us better at competing with other people \u2014
p233
aVthey're positional goods.
p234
aVBut part of the reason \u2014
p235
aVand that's the reason why we have ethical ground for pursuing these \u2014
p236
aVis that they're also intrinsically valuable.
p237
aVIt's just better to be able to understand more of the world around you
p238
aVand the people that you are communicating with,
p239
aVand to remember what you have learned.
p240
aVModalities and special faculties.
p241
aVNow, the human mind is not a single unitary information processor,
p242
aVbut it has a lot of different, special, evolved modules
p243
aVthat do specific things for us.
p244
aVIf you think about what we normally take as giving life a lot of its meaning \u2014
p245
aVmusic, humor, eroticism, spirituality, aesthetics,
p246
aVnurturing and caring, gossip, chatting with people \u2014
p247
aa(lp248
Vall of these, very likely, are enabled by a special circuitry
p249
aVthat we humans have,
p250
aVbut that you could have another intelligent life form that lacks these.
p251
aVWe're just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery
p252
aVto process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it.
p253
aVAll of these would enable, in principle \u2014 be amenable to enhancement.
p254
aVSome people have a better musical ability
p255
aVand ability to appreciate music than others have.
p256
aVIt's also interesting to think about what other things are \u2014
p257
aVso if these all enabled great values,
p258
aVwhy should we think that evolution has happened to provide us
p259
aVwith all the modalities we would need to engage
p260
aVwith other values that there might be?
p261
aa(lp262
VImagine a species
p263
aVthat just didn't have this neural machinery for processing music.
p264
aVAnd they would just stare at us with bafflement
p265
aVwhen we spend time listening to a beautiful performance,
p266
aVlike the one we just heard \u2014 because of people making stupid movements,
p267
aVand they would be really irritated and wouldn't see what we were up to.
p268
aVBut maybe they have another faculty, something else
p269
aVthat would seem equally irrational to us,
p270
aVbut they actually tap into some great possible value there.
p271
aVBut we are just literally deaf to that kind of value.
p272
aVSo we could think of adding on different,
p273
aVnew sensory capacities and mental faculties.
p274
aVBodily functionality and morphology and affective self-control.
p275
aVGreater subjective well-being.
p276
aVBe able to switch between relaxation and activity \u2014
p277
aVbeing able to go slow when you need to do that, and to speed up.
p278
aVAble to switch back and forth more easily
p279
aVwould be a neat thing to be able to do \u2014
p280
aVeasier to achieve the flow state,
p281
aVwhen you're totally immersed in something you are doing.
p282
aVConscientiousness and sympathy.
p283
aVThe ability to \u2014 it's another interesting application
p284
aVthat would have large social ramification, perhaps.
p285
aVIf you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person,
p286
aVundiminished through time,
p287
aVso that wouldn't have to \u2014 love would never have to fade if you didn't want it to.
p288
aVThat's probably not all that difficult.
p289
aVIt might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this.
p290
aa(lp291
VIt's been done in voles.
p292
aVYou can engineer a prairie vole to become monogamous
p293
aVwhen it's naturally polygamous.
p294
aVIt's just a single gene.
p295
aVMight be more complicated in humans, but perhaps not that much.
p296
aVThis is the last picture that I want to \u2014
p297
aVnow we've got to use the laser pointer.
p298
aVA possible mode of being here would be a way of life \u2014
p299
aVa way of being, experiencing, thinking, seeing,
p300
aVinteracting with the world.
p301
aVDown here in this little corner, here, we have the little sub-space
p302
aVof this larger space that is accessible to human beings \u2014
p303
aVbeings with our biological capacities.
p304
aVIt's a part of the space that's accessible to animals;
p305
aVsince we are animals, we are a subset of that.
p306
aa(lp307
VAnd then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities.
p308
aVThere would be different modes of being you could experience
p309
aVif you were able to stay alive for, say, 200 years.
p310
aVThen you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms
p311
aVthat are just not possible for humans as we currently are.
p312
aVSo then, you move off to this larger sphere of "human +,"
p313
aVand you could continue that process and eventually
p314
aVexplore a lot of this larger space of possible modes of being.
p315
aa(lp316
VNow, why is that a good thing to do?
p317
aVWell, we know already that in this little human circle there,
p318
aVthere are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being \u2014
p319
aVhuman life at its best is wonderful.
p320
aVWe have no reason to believe that within this much, much larger space
p321
aVthere would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being,
p322
aVperhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability
p323
aVeven to imagine or dream about.
p324
aVAnd so, to fix this third problem,
p325
aVI think we need \u2014 slowly, carefully, with ethical wisdom and constraint \u2014
p326
aVdevelop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it
p327
aVand find the great values that might hide there.
p328
aVThanks.
