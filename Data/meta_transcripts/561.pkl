p5
aVI emitted, in the atmosphere, nine tons of CO2;
p6
aVthat is the weight of two elephants.
p7
aVI came here to speak about ecology,
p8
aVand I emitted as much CO2
p9
aVas a Frenchman in one year.
p10
aVSo what do I have to do?
p11
aVI have to kill a Frenchman when I come back at home?
p12
aV(Laughter)
p13
aVI have to do my carbon offset in another way,
p14
aVlike I do every time.
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VIn fact my work is to show
p18
aVour impact on our planet.

p26
aVIn Alberta people work nonstop,
p27
aV24 hours by seven
p28
aVto extract as much oil
p29
aVas they can.
p30
aVWe know about the end of oil.
p31
aVOil sand is not a long-term solution.
p32
aVBut we use three times more oil
p33
aVthan we find every year.
p34
aVWe don't want to believe what we know.
p35
aVDeny.
p36
aa(lp37
VCoral reef in New Caledonia.
p38
aV100 percent of the coral
p39
aVmay be wiped out before 2050
p40
aVbecause of global warming.
p41
aVAnd you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature,
p42
aVand are very important for the biodiversity of the sea.
p43
aa(lp44
VNorth Pole. I've done this picture last summer.

p54
aVAccording to scientists,
p55

p70
aVWe don't want to believe what we know.
p71

VThe beautiful picture, by [unclear] in Africa.

p89
aa(lp90
VI always show my pictures in the street.
p91
aVWe have done already 100 exhibitions in the cities.
p92
aVBut how to understand the world
p93
aVwithout the voice of people?
p94
aVLandscape was not enough.
p95
aVIt was obvious to me to do another work.
p96
aVI launched a project named Six Billion Others.
p97
aVI sent around the world six cameramen
p98
aVasking the same question,
p99
aVthe same crucial question,
p100
aVabout life.
p101
aVWe have done five thousand interviews.
p102
aVI'm going to show you this.
p103
aa(lp104
VMan: The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life?
p105
aVIt's when my dad told me, "Here, I give you this girl as your fiance."
p106
aa(lp107
VWoman: Love? Love is nice if you can have it.
p108
aa(lp109
VSecond Man: Romeo and Juliet, Sassi and Panno, Dodi and Diana, Heer and Ranjha,
p110
aVthis is love! Third Man: My greatest fear is ...
p111
aa(lp112
VWoman: You're asking me a hard question.
p113
aa(lp114
VFourth Man: I live happily because what else should I do?
p115
aa(lp116
VFifth Man: The first thing I remember ... (Sixth Man: That's how I learned, by my mother,)
p117
aVFifth Man: ... from my childhood, (Sixth Man: that you should respect humans.)
p118
aVFifth Man: we were having fun, biking. (Sixth Man: I will never forget those words.)
p119
aa(lp120
VSeventh Man: We invented stories, we flew around the world, while remaining in our attic.
p121
aa(lp122
VEighth Man: I had a big laugh today.
p123
aVNinth Man: You see, family is ... it's awful.
p124
aa(lp125
V10th Man: In the word life, you have the life.
p126
aa(lp127
V11th Man: Who am I? Isn't that the biggest question?
p128
aa(lp129
V12th Man: If I was to go back to Iraq
p130
aVand speak to the people,
p131
aVI'd have to bow down and kiss their feet.
p132
aVJust as that woman tried to kiss my feet
p133
aVwhen we were taking her sons.
p134
aVI feel ashamed.
p135
aVAnd I feel humbled
p136

p142
aVMy family ... What can I say?
p143
aVAt the moment, my family is very poor,
p144
aVmy life here in Shenzhen is just about showing myself that I can earn more
p145
aVand to let my parents stay and have something to live on.
p146
aVI don't want them to spend their whole lives in poverty.
p147
aVIf someday I can achieve something, I would like to say thank you daddy and mommy.
p148
aVThank you.
p149
aVThank you for having fed me and raised me,
p150
aVand for making my life of today. Thank you.
p151
aa(lp152
V13th Man: After seven years now of being in a wheelchair,
p153
aVI've done more in life being in a chair
p154
aVthan out of a chair.
p155
aVI still surf. I sail the world. I freedive.
p156
aVAfter many people said I couldn't do that.
p157
aVAnd I think that comes from connecting with nature,
p158
aVconnecting with the energy of life,
p159
aVbecause we're all disabled in some way on the planet \u2014
p160
aVspiritually, mentally or physically.
p161
aVI got the easy part.
p162
aa(lp163
V14th Man: Let's say that you and me like each other.
p164
aVYou come from elsewhere.
p165
aVYou don't know me. I don't know you.
p166
aVWe talk without lying.
p167
aVIf I do like you, I give you one cow and many other things
p168
aVand we become friends.
p169

p176
aa(lp177
VNow I am going to speak to you about my movie.
p178
aVFor the last three years,
p179
aVI was shooting the earth for the movie.
p180
aVThe name of the movie is "Home" \u2014
p181
aV"Maison."
p182
aVIt is about the state of the planet.
p183
aVIt's a fantastic story of life on the earth.
p184
aVI'm very proud to show you the teaser.
p185
aa(lp186
VVideo: This Earth is four and a half billion years old.
p187
aVThese plants, several hundred million years old.
p188
aVAnd we humans have been walking upright
p189
aVfor only 200 thousand years.
p190
aVWe've managed to adapt,
p191
aVand have conquered the whole planet.
p192
aVFor generations, we've been raising our children,
p193
aVnot unlike millions of other species living beside us.
p194
aVFor the past 30 years
p195
aVI've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers
p196
aVfrom high up in the sky.
p197
aVOur life is tied to the well-being of our planet.
p198
aVWe depend on water,
p199
aVforests,
p200
aVdeserts,
p201
aVoceans.
p202
aVFishing,
p203
aVbreeding,
p204
aVfarming
p205
aVare still the world's foremost human occupations.
p206
aVAnd what binds us together
p207
aVis far greater than what divides us.
p208
aVWe all share the same need for the earth's gifts \u2014
p209
aVthe same wish to rise above ourselves,
p210
aVand become better.
p211
aVAnd yet we carry on raising walls
p212
aVto keep us apart.
p213
aa(lp214
VToday our greatest battle
p215
aVis to protect the natural offerings of our planet.
p216
aVIn less than 50 years
p217
aVwe've altered it more thoroughly
p218
aVthan in the entire history of mankind.
p219
aVHalf of the world's forests have vanished.
p220
aVWater resources are running low.
p221
aVIntensive farming is depleting soils.
p222
aVOur energy sources are not sustainable.
p223
aVThe climate is changing.
p224
aVWe are endangering ourselves.
p225
aVWe're only trying to improve our lives.
p226
aVBut the wealth gaps are growing wider.
p227
aVWe haven't yet understood
p228
aVthat we're going at a much faster pace
p229
aVthan the planet can sustain.
p230
aVWe know that solutions are available today.
p231
aVWe all have the power to change this trend
p232
aVfor the better.
p233
aVSo what are we waiting for?
p234
aV(Applause)
p235
aa(lp236
VYAB: Luc Besson is the producer of the movie.
p237
aVBut it is not a normal movie.
p238
aVThe film is going to be distributed free.
p239
aVThis film has no copyright.
p240
aVOn the five of June,
p241
aVthe environment day,
p242
aVeverybody can download the movie on Internet.
p243
aVThe film is given for free
p244
aVto the distributor for TV and theater
p245
aVto show it the fifth of June.
p246
aVThere is no business on this movie.
p247
aVIt is also available for school,
p248
aVcities, NGOs and you.
p249
aa(lp250
VWe have to believe what we know.
p251
aVLet me tell you something.
p252
aVIt's too late to be pessimistic \u2014
p253
aVreally too late.
p254
aVWe have all a part of the solutions.
p255
aVTo finish,
p256
aVI would like to welcome
p257
aVthe 4,700th baby
p258
aVborn since the beginning of this talk.
