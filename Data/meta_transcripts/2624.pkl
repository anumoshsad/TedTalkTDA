VCarlos,
p4
aVthe Vietnam vet Marine
p5
aVwho volunteered for three tours and got shot up in every one.
p6
aVIn 1971, he was medically retired
p7
aVbecause he had so much shrapnel in his body
p8
aVthat he was setting off metal detectors.
p9
aVFor the next 42 years, he suffered from nightmares,
p10
aVextreme anxiety in public,
p11
aVisolation, depression.
p12
aVHe self-medicated with alcohol.
p13
aVHe was married and divorced three times.
p14
aVCarlos had post-traumatic stress disorder.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow, I became a psychologist to help mitigate human suffering,
p17
aVand for the past 10 years, my target has been the suffering caused by PTSD,
p18
aVas experienced by veterans like Carlos.
p19
aVUntil recently, the science of PTSD just wasn't there.
p20
aVAnd so, we didn't know what to do.
p21
aVWe put some veterans on heavy drugs.
p22
aVOthers we hospitalized and gave generic group therapy,
p23
aVand others still we simply said to them,
p24
aV"Just go home and try to forget about your experiences."
p25
aVMore recently, we've tried therapy dogs, wilderness retreats \u2014
p26
aVmany things which may temporarily relieve stress,
p27
aVbut which don't actually eliminate PTSD symptoms over the long term.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut things have changed.
p30
aVAnd I am here to tell you that we can now eliminate PTSD,
p31
aVnot just manage the symptoms,
p32
aVand in huge numbers of veterans.
p33
aVBecause new scientific research has been able to show,
p34
aVobjectively, repeatedly,
p35
aVwhich treatments actually get rid of symptoms and which do not.
p36
aa(lp37
VNow as it turns out,
p38
aVthe best treatments for PTSD use many of the very same training principles
p39
aVthat the military uses in preparing its trainees for war.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow, making war \u2014
p42
aVthis is something that we are good at.
p43
aVWe humans have been making war since before we were even fully human.
p44
aVAnd since then, we have gone from using stone and sinew
p45
aVto developing the most sophisticated and devastating weapon systems imaginable.
p46
aVAnd to enable our warriors to use these weapons,
p47
aVwe employ the most cutting-edge training methods.
p48
aVWe are good at making war.
p49
aVAnd we are good at training our warriors to fight.
p50
aa(lp51
VYet, when we consider the experience of the modern-day combat veteran,
p52
aVwe begin to see that we have not been as good
p53
aVat preparing them to come home.
p54
aVWhy is that?
p55
aVWell, our ancestors lived immersed in conflict,
p56
aVand they fought right where they lived.
p57
aVSo until only very recently in our evolutionary history,
p58
aVthere was hardly a need to learn how to come home from war,
p59
aVbecause we never really did.
p60
aVBut thankfully, today,
p61
aVmost of humanity lives in far more peaceful societies,
p62
aVand when there is conflict, we, especially in the United States,
p63
aVnow have the technology to put our warriors through advanced training,
p64
aVdrop them in to fight anywhere on the globe
p65
aVand when they're done,
p66
aVjet them back to peacetime suburbia.
p67
aa(lp68
VBut just imagine for a moment what this must feel like.
p69
aVI've spoken with veterans who've told me
p70
aVthat one day they're in a brutal firefight in Afghanistan
p71
aVwhere they saw carnage and death,
p72
aVand just three days later, they found themselves
p73
aVtoting an ice chest to their kid's soccer game.
p74
aV"Mindfuck" is the most common term.
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VIt's the most common term I've heard to describe that experience.
p79
aVAnd that's exactly what that is.
p80
aVBecause while our warriors spend countless hours training for war,
p81
aVwe've only recently come to understand
p82
aVthat many require training on how to return to civilian life.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow, like any training, the best PTSD treatments require repetition.
p85
aVIn the military,
p86
aVwe don't simply hand trainees Mark-19 automatic grenade launchers
p87
aVand say, "Here's the trigger, here's some ammo and good luck."
p88
aVNo. We train them, on the range and in specific contexts,
p89
aVover and over and over
p90
aVuntil lifting their weapon and engaging their target
p91
aVis so engrained into muscle memory
p92
aVthat it can be performed without even thinking,
p93
aVeven under the most stressful conditions you can imagine.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, the same holds for training-based treatments.
p96
aVThe first of these treatments is cognitive therapy,
p97
aVand this is a kind of mental recalibration.
p98
aVWhen veterans come home from war,
p99
aVtheir way of mentally framing the world is calibrated
p100
aVto an immensely more dangerous environment.
p101
aVSo when you try to overlay that mind frame onto a peacetime environment,
p102
aVyou get problems.
p103
aVYou begin drowning in worries about dangers that aren't present.
p104
aVYou begin not trusting family or friends.
p105
aVWhich is not to say there are no dangers in civilian life; there are.
p106
aVIt's just that the probability of encountering them
p107
aVcompared to combat
p108
aVis astronomically lower.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo we never advise veterans to turn off caution completely.
p111
aVWe do train them, however, to adjust caution
p112
aVaccording to where they are.
p113
aVIf you find yourself in a bad neighborhood,
p114
aVyou turn it up.
p115
aVOut to dinner with family?
p116
aVYou turn it way down.
p117
aVWe train veterans to be fiercely rational,
p118
aVto systematically gauge the actual statistical probability
p119
aVof encountering, say, an IED here in peacetime America.
p120
aVWith enough practice, those recalibrations stick.
p121
aa(lp122
VThe next of these treatments is exposure therapy,
p123
aVand this is a kind of field training,
p124
aVand the fastest of the proven effective treatments out there.
p125
aa(lp126
VYou remember Carlos?
p127
aVThis was the treatment that he chose.
p128
aVAnd so we started off by giving him exercises,
p129
aVfor him, challenging ones:
p130
aVgoing to a grocery store,
p131
aVgoing to a shopping mall, going to a restaurant,
p132
aVsitting with his back to the door.
p133
aVAnd, critically \u2014
p134
aVstaying in these environments.
p135
aVNow, at first he was very anxious.
p136
aVHe wanted to sit where he could scan the room,
p137
aVwhere he could plan escape routes,
p138
aVwhere he could get his hands on a makeshift weapon.
p139
aVAnd he wanted to leave, but he didn't.
p140
aVHe remembered his training in the Marine Corps,
p141
aVand he pushed through his discomfort.
p142
aVAnd every time he did this, his anxiety ratcheted down a little bit,
p143
aVand then a little bit more and then a little bit more,
p144
aVuntil in the end,
p145
aVhe had effectively relearned how to sit in a public space
p146
aVand just enjoy himself.
p147
aa(lp148
VHe also listened to recordings of his combat experiences,
p149
aVover and over and over.
p150
aVHe listened until those memories no longer generated any anxiety.
p151
aVHe processed his memories so much
p152
aVthat his brain no longer needed to return to those experiences
p153
aVin his sleep.
p154
aVAnd when I spoke with him a year after treatment had finished,
p155
aVhe told me,
p156
aV"Doc, this is the first time in 43 years
p157
aVthat I haven't had nightmares."
p158
aa(lp159
VNow, this is different than erasing a memory.
p160
aVVeterans will always remember their traumatic experiences,
p161
aVbut with enough practice,
p162
aVthose memories are no longer as raw or as painful as they once were.
p163
aVThey don't feel emotionally like they just happened yesterday,
p164
aVand that is an immensely better place to be.
p165
aa(lp166
VBut it's often difficult.
p167
aVAnd, like any training, it may not work for everybody.
p168
aVAnd there are trust issues.
p169
aVSometimes I'm asked,
p170
aV"If you haven't been there, Doc, how can you help me?"
p171
aVWhich is understandable.
p172
aVBut at the point of returning to civilian life,
p173
aVyou do not require somebody who's been there.
p174
aVYou don't require training for operations on the battlefield;
p175
aVyou require training on how to come home.
p176
aa(lp177
VFor the past 10 years of my work,
p178
aVI have been exposed to detailed accounts
p179
aVof the worst experiences that you can imagine,
p180
aVdaily.
p181
aVAnd it hasn't always been easy.
p182
aVThere have been times where I have just felt my heart break
p183
aVor that I've absorbed too much.
p184
aVBut these training-based treatments work so well,
p185
aVthat whatever this work takes out of me, it puts back even more,
p186
aVbecause I see people get better.
p187
aVI see people's lives transform.
p188
aa(lp189
VCarlos can now enjoy outings with his grandchildren,
p190
aVwhich is something he couldn't even do with his own children.
p191
aVAnd what's amazing to me is that after 43 years of suffering,
p192
aVit only took him 10 weeks of intense training to get his life back.
p193
aVAnd when I spoke with him, he told me,
p194
aV"I know that I can't get those years back.
p195
aVBut at least now, whatever days that I have left on this Earth,
p196
aVI can live them in peace."
p197
aVHe also said, "I hope that these younger veterans don't wait
p198
aVto get the help they need."
p199
aVAnd that's my hope, too.
p200
aVBecause ...
p201
aVthis life is short,
p202
aVand if you are fortunate enough to have survived war
p203
aVor any kind of traumatic experience,
p204
aVyou owe it to yourself to live your life well.
p205
aVAnd you shouldn't wait to get the training you need
p206
aVto make that happen.
p207
aa(lp208
VNow, the best way of ending human suffering caused by war
p209
aVis to never go to war.
p210
aVBut we are just not there yet as a species.
p211
aVUntil we are,
p212
aVthe mental suffering that we create in our sons and in our daughters
p213
aVwhen we send them off to fight
p214
aVcan be alleviated.
p215
aVBut we must ensure that the science, the energy level, the value
p216
aVthat we place on sending them off to war
p217
aVis at the very least mirrored
p218
aVin how well we prepare them to come back home to us.
p219
aVThis much, we owe them.
p220
aa(lp221
VThank you.
