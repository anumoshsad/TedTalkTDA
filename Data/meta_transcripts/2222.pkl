VTonight, I'm going to try to make the case
p4
aVthat inviting a loved one, a friend or even a stranger
p5
aVto record a meaningful interview with you
p6
aVjust might turn out to be one of the most  important moments in that person's life,
p7
aVand in yours.
p8
aa(lp9
VWhen I was 22 years old, I was lucky enough to find my calling
p10
aVwhen I fell into making radio stories.
p11
aVAt almost the exact same time,
p12
aVI found out that my dad, who I was very, very close to, was gay.
p13
aVI was taken completely by surprise.
p14
aVWe were a very tight-knit family,
p15
aVand I was crushed.
p16
aVAt some point, in one of our strained conversations,
p17
aVmy dad mentioned the Stonewall riots.
p18
aVHe told me that one night in 1969,
p19
aVa group of young black and Latino drag queens
p20
aVfought back against the police at a gay bar in Manhattan
p21
aVcalled the Stonewall Inn,
p22
aVand how this sparked the modern gay rights movement.
p23
aa(lp24
VIt was an amazing story, and it piqued my interest.
p25
aVSo I decided to pick up my tape  recorder and find out more.
p26
aVWith the help of a young archivist named Michael Shirker,
p27
aVwe tracked down all of the people we could find
p28
aVwho had been at the Stonewall Inn that night.
p29
aVRecording these interviews,
p30
aVI saw how the microphone gave me the license
p31
aVto go places I otherwise never would have gone
p32
aVand talk to people I might not otherwise ever have spoken to.
p33
aVI had the privilege of getting to know
p34
aVsome of the most amazing, fierce and courageous human beings
p35
aVI had ever met.
p36
aVIt was the first time the story of Stonewall
p37
aVhad been told to a national audience.
p38
aVI dedicated the program to my dad,
p39
aVit changed my relationship with him, and it changed my life.
p40
aa(lp41
VOver the next 15 years, I made many more radio documentaries,
p42
aVworking to shine a light on people who are rarely heard from in the media.
p43
aVOver and over again,
p44
aVI'd see how this simple act of being interviewed
p45
aVcould mean so much to people,
p46
aVparticularly those who had been told that their stories didn't matter.
p47
aVI could literally see people's back straighten
p48
aVas they started to speak into the microphone.
p49
aa(lp50
VIn 1998, I made a documentary about the last flophouse hotels
p51
aVon the Bowery in Manhattan.
p52
aVGuys stayed up in these cheap hotels for decades.
p53
aVThey lived in cubicles the size of prison cells
p54
aVcovered with chicken wire
p55
aVso you couldn't jump from one room into the next.
p56
aVLater, I wrote a book on the men with the photographer Harvey Wang.
p57
aVI remember walking into a flophouse with an early version of the book
p58
aVand showing one of the guys his page.
p59
aVHe stood there staring at it in silence,
p60
aVthen he grabbed the book out of my hand
p61
aVand started running down the long, narrow hallway
p62
aVholding it over his head
p63
aVshouting, "I exist! I exist."
p64
aV(Applause)
p65
aa(lp66
VIn many ways, "I exist" became the clarion call for StoryCorps,
p67
aVthis crazy idea that I had a dozen years ago.
p68
aVThe thought was to take documentary work
p69
aVand turn it on its head.
p70
aVTraditionally, broadcast documentary
p71
aVhas been about recording interviews to create a work of art or entertainment
p72
aVor education that is seen or heard by a whole lot of people,
p73
aVbut I wanted to try something
p74
aVwhere the interview itself was the purpose of this work,
p75
aVand see if we could give many, many, many people the chance
p76
aVto be listened to in this way.
p77
aVSo in Grand Central Terminal 11 years ago,
p78
aVwe built a booth where anyone  can come to honor someone else
p79
aVby interviewing them about their life.
p80
aVYou come to this booth and you're met by a facilitator who brings you inside.
p81
aVYou sit across from, say, your grandfather
p82
aVfor close to an hour and you listen and you talk.
p83
aVMany people think of it as, if this was to be our last conversation,
p84
aVwhat would I want to ask of and say to this person
p85
aVwho means so much to me?
p86
aVAt the end of the session, you walk away with a copy of the interview
p87
aVand another copy goes to the American Folklife Center
p88
aVat the Library of Congress
p89
aVso that your great-great-great-grandkids can someday get to know your grandfather
p90
aVthrough his voice and story.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo we open this booth in one of the busiest places in the world
p93
aVand invite people to have this incredibly intimate conversation
p94
aVwith another human being.
p95
aVI had no idea if it would work, but from the very beginning, it did.
p96
aVPeople treated the experience with incredible respect,
p97
aVand amazing conversations happened inside.
p98
aa(lp99
VI want to play just one animated excerpt
p100
aVfrom an interview recorded at that original Grand Central Booth.
p101
aVThis is 12-year-old Joshua Littman interviewing his mother, Sarah.
p102
aVJosh has Asperger's syndrome.
p103
aVAs you may know, kids with Asperger's are incredibly smart
p104
aVbut have a tough time socially.
p105
aVThey usually have obsessions.
p106
aVIn Josh's case, it's with animals,
p107
aVso this is Josh talking with his mom Sarah
p108
aVat Grand Central nine years ago.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Video) Josh Littman: From a scale of one to 10,
p111
aVdo you think your life would be different without animals?
p112
aVSarah Littman: I think it would be an eight without animals,
p113
aVbecause they add so much pleasure to life.
p114
aa(lp115
VJL: How else do you think your life would be different without them?
p116
aa(lp117
VSL: I could do without things like cockroaches and snakes.
p118
aa(lp119
VJL: Well, I'm okay with snakes as long as they're not venomous
p120
aVor constrict you or anything.
p121
aa(lp122
VSL: Yeah, I'm not a big snake person \u2014
p123
aa(lp124
VJL: But cockroach is just the insect we love to hate.
p125
aa(lp126
VSL: Yeah, it really is.
p127
aa(lp128
VJL: Have you ever thought you couldn't cope with having a child?
p129
aa(lp130
VSL: I remember when you were a baby, you had really bad colic,
p131
aVso you would just cry and cry.
p132
aa(lp133
VJL: What's colic? SL: It's when you get this stomach ache
p134
aVand all you do is scream for, like, four hours.
p135
aa(lp136
VJL: Even louder than Amy does?
p137
aa(lp138
VSL: You were pretty loud, but Amy's was more high-pitched.
p139
aa(lp140
VJL: I think it feels like everyone seems to like Amy more,
p141
aVlike she's the perfect little angel.
p142
aa(lp143
VSL: Well, I can understand why you think that people like Amy more,
p144
aVand I'm not saying it's because of your Asperger's syndrome,
p145
aVbut being friendly comes easily to Amy,
p146
aVwhereas I think for you it's more difficult,
p147
aVbut the people who take the time to get to know you love you so much.
p148
aa(lp149
VJL: Like Ben or Eric or Carlos? SL: Yeah \u2014
p150
aa(lp151
VJL: Like I have better quality friends but less quantity? (Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VSL: I wouldn't judge the quality, but I think \u2014
p154
aVJL: I mean, first it was like, Amy loved Claudia, then she hated Claudia,
p155
aVshe loved Claudia, then she hated Claudia.
p156
aa(lp157
VSL: Part of that's a girl thing, honey.
p158
aVThe important thing for you is that you have a few very good friends,
p159
aVand really that's what you need in life.
p160
aa(lp161
VJL: Did I turn out to be the son you wanted when I was born?
p162
aVDid I meet your expectations?
p163
aa(lp164
VSL: You've exceeded my expectations, sweetie,
p165
aVbecause, sure, you have these fantasies of what your child's going to be like,
p166
aVbut you have made me grow so much as a parent, because you think \u2014
p167
aa(lp168
VJL: Well, I was the one who made you a parent.
p169
aa(lp170
VSL: You were the one who made me a parent. That's a good point. (Laughter)
p171
aVBut also because you think differently
p172
aVfrom what they tell you in the parenting books,
p173
aVI really had to learn to think outside of the box with you,
p174
aVand it's made me much more creative as a parent and as a person,
p175
aVand I'll always thank you for that.
p176
aa(lp177
VJL: And that helped when Amy was born?
p178
aa(lp179
VSL: And that helped when Amy was born, but you are so incredibly special to me
p180
aVand I'm so lucky to have you as my son.
p181
aV(Applause)
p182
aa(lp183
VDavid Isay: After this story ran on public radio,
p184
aVJosh received hundreds of letters
p185
aVtelling him what an amazing kid he was.
p186
aVHis mom, Sarah, bound them together in a book,
p187
aVand when Josh got picked on at school, they would read the letters together.
p188
aVI just want to acknowledge that two of my heroes
p189
aVare here with us tonight.
p190
aVSarah Littman and her son Josh, who is now an honors student in college.
p191
aV(Applause)
p192
aa(lp193
VYou know, a lot of people talk about crying when they hear StoryCorps stories,
p194
aVand it's not because they're sad.
p195
aVMost of them aren't.
p196
aVI think it's because you're hearing something authentic and pure
p197
aVat this moment, when sometimes it's hard to tell
p198
aVwhat's real and what's an advertisement.
p199
aVIt's kind of the anti-reality TV.
p200
aVNobody comes to StoryCorps to get rich.
p201
aVNobody comes to get famous.
p202
aVIt's simply an act of generosity and love.
p203
aVSo many of these are just everyday people
p204
aVtalking about lives lived with kindness, courage, decency and dignity,
p205
aVand when you hear that kind of story,
p206
aVit can sometimes feel like you're walking on holy ground.
p207
aVSo this experiment  in Grand Central worked,
p208
aa(lp209
Vand we expanded across the country.
p210
aVToday, more than 100,000 people in all 50 states
p211
aVin thousands of cities and towns across America
p212
aVhave recorded StoryCorps interviews.
p213
aVIt's now the largest single collection of human voices ever gathered.
p214
aV(Applause)
p215
aa(lp216
VWe've hired and trained hundreds of facilitators
p217
aVto help guide people through the experience.
p218
aVMost serve a year or two with StoryCorps
p219
aVtraveling the country, gathering the wisdom of humanity.
p220
aVThey call it bearing witness,
p221
aVand if you ask them,
p222
aVall of the facilitators will tell you that the most important thing
p223
aVthey've learned from being present during these interviews
p224
aVis that people are basically good.
p225
aVAnd I think for the first years of StoryCorps, you could argue
p226
aVthat there was some kind of a selection bias happening,
p227
aVbut after tens of thousands of interviews with every kind of person
p228
aVin every part of the country \u2014
p229
aVrich, poor, five years old to 105,
p230
aV80 different languages, across the political spectrum \u2014
p231
aVyou have to think that maybe these guys are actually onto something.
p232
aa(lp233
VI've also learned so much from these interviews.
p234
aVI've learned about the poetry and the wisdom and the grace
p235
aVthat can be found in the words of people all around us
p236
aVwhen we simply take the time to listen,
p237
aVlike this interview
p238
aVbetween a betting clerk in Brooklyn named Danny Perasa
p239
aVwho brought his wife Annie to StoryCorps to talk about his love for her.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Audio) Danny Perasa: You see, the thing of it is,
p242
aVI always feel guilty when I say "I love you" to you.
p243
aVAnd I say it so often. I say it to remind you
p244
aVthat as dumpy as I am, it's coming from me.
p245
aVIt's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio,
p246
aVand it's nice of you to keep the radio around the house.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnnie Perasa: If I don't have a note on the kitchen table,
p249
aVI think there's something wrong.
p250
aVYou write a love letter to me every morning.
p251
aVDP: Well, the only thing that could possibly be wrong
p252
aVis I couldn't find a silly pen.
p253
aa(lp254
VAP: To my princess:
p255
aVThe weather outside today is extremely rainy.
p256
aVI'll call you at 11:20 in the morning.
p257
aa(lp258
VDP: It's a romantic weather report.
p259
aa(lp260
VAP: And I love you. I love you. I love you.
p261
aa(lp262
VDP: When a guy is happily married, no matter what happens at work,
p263
aVno matter what happens in the rest of the day,
p264
aVthere's a shelter when you get home,
p265
aVthere's a knowledge knowing that you can hug somebody
p266
aVwithout them throwing you downstairs and saying, "Get your hands off me."
p267
aVBeing married is like having a color television set.
p268
aVYou never want to go back to black and white.
p269
aV(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
VDI: Danny was about five feet tall
p272
aVwith crossed eyes and one single snaggletooth,
p273
aVbut Danny Perasa had more romance in his little pinky
p274
aVthan all of Hollywood's leading men put together.
p275
aa(lp276
VWhat else have I learned?
p277
aVI've learned about the almost unimaginable capacity
p278
aVfor the human spirit to forgive.
p279
aVI've learned about resilience and I've learned about strength.
p280
aa(lp281
VLike an interview with Oshea Israel and Mary Johnson.
p282
aVWhen Oshea was a teenager, he murdered Mary's only son,
p283
aVLaramiun Byrd, in a gang fight.
p284
aVA dozen years later, Mary went to prison
p285
aVto meet Oshea and find out who this person was
p286
aVwho had taken her son's life.
p287
aVSlowly and remarkably, they became friends,
p288
aVand when he was finally released from the penitentiary,
p289
aVOshea actually moved in next door to Mary.
p290
aVThis is just a short excerpt of a conversation they had
p291
aVsoon after Oshea was freed.
p292
aa(lp293
V(Video) Mary Johnson: My natural son is no longer here.
p294
aVI didn't see him graduate, and now you're going to college.
p295
aVI'll have the opportunity to see you graduate.
p296
aVI didn't see him get married.
p297
aVHopefully one day, I'll be able to experience that with you.
p298
aVOshea Israel: Just to hear you say those things and to be
p299
aVin my life in the manner in which you are is my motivation.
p300
aVIt motivates me to make sure that I stay on the right path.
p301
aVYou still believe in me,
p302
aVand the fact that you can do it despite how much pain I caused you,
p303
aVit's amazing.
p304
aa(lp305
VMJ: I know it's not an easy thing to be able to share our story together,
p306
aVeven with us sitting here looking at each other right now.
p307
aVI know it's not an easy thing, so I admire that you can do this.
p308
aa(lp309
VOI: I love you, lady. MJ: I love you too, son.
p310
aV(Applause)
p311
aa(lp312
VDI: And I've been reminded countless times of the courage and goodness of people,
p313
aVand how the arc of history truly does bend towards justice.
p314
aa(lp315
VLike the story of Alexis Martinez, who was born Arthur Martinez
p316
aVin the Harold Ickes projects in Chicago.
p317
aVIn the interview, she talks with her daughter Lesley
p318
aVabout joining a gang as a young man,
p319
aVand later in life transitioning into the woman she was always meant to be.
p320
aVThis is Alexis and her daughter Lesley.
p321
aa(lp322
V(Audio) Alexis Martinez: One of the most difficult things for me was
p323
aVI was always afraid that I wouldn't be allowed
p324
aVto be in my granddaughters' lives,
p325
aVand you blew that completely out of the water,
p326
aVyou and your husband.
p327
aVOne of the fruits of that is, in my relationship with my granddaughters,
p328
aVthey fight with each other sometimes over whether I'm he or she.
p329
aa(lp330
VLesley Martinez: But they're free to talk about it.
p331
aa(lp332
VAM: They're free to talk about it, but that, to me, is a miracle.
p333
aa(lp334
VLM: You don't have to apologize. You don't have to tiptoe.
p335
aVWe're not going to cut you off, and that's something I've always
p336
aVwanted you to just know, that you're loved.
p337
aa(lp338
VAM: You know, I live this every day now.
p339
aVI walk down the streets as a woman, and I really am at peace with who I am.
p340
aVI mean, I wish I had a softer voice maybe,
p341
aVbut now I walk in love and I try to live that way every day.
p342
aa(lp343
VDI: Now I walk in love.
p344
aa(lp345
VI'm going to tell you a secret about StoryCorps.
p346
aVIt takes some courage to have these conversations.
p347
aVStoryCorps speaks to our mortality.
p348
aVParticipants know this recording will be heard long after they're gone.
p349
aVThere's a hospice doctor named Ira Byock
p350
aVwho has worked closely with us on recording interviews
p351
aVwith people who are dying.
p352
aVHe wrote a book called "The Four Things That Matter Most"
p353
aVabout the four things you want to say to the most important people in your life
p354
aVbefore they or you die:
p355
aVthank you, I love you,
p356
aVforgive me, I forgive you.
p357
aVThey're just about the most powerful words we can say to one another,
p358
aVand often that's what happens in a StoryCorps booth.
p359
aVIt's a chance to have a sense of closure with someone you care about \u2014
p360
aVno regrets, nothing left unsaid.
p361
aVAnd it's hard and it takes courage,
p362
aVbut that's why we're alive, right?
p363
aa(lp364
VSo, the TED Prize.
p365
aVWhen I first heard from TED and Chris a few months ago
p366
aVabout the possibility of the Prize, I was completely floored.
p367
aVThey asked me to come up with a very brief wish for humanity,
p368
aVno more than 50 words.
p369
aVSo I thought about it, I wrote my 50 words,
p370
aVand a few weeks later, Chris called and said, "Go for it."
p371
aa(lp372
VSo here is my wish:
p373
aVthat you will help us
p374
aVtake everything we've learned through StoryCorps
p375
aVand bring it to the world
p376
aVso that anyone anywhere can easily record a meaningful interview
p377
aVwith another human being which will then be archived for history.
p378
aa(lp379
VHow are we going to do that? With this.
p380
aVWe're fast moving into a future where everyone in the world
p381
aVwill have access to one of these,
p382
aVand it has powers I never could have imagined 11 years ago
p383
aVwhen I started StoryCorps.
p384
aVIt has a microphone,
p385
aVit can tell you how to do things,
p386
aVand it can send audio files.
p387
aVThose are the key ingredients.
p388
aa(lp389
VSo the first part of the wish is already underway.
p390
aVOver the past couple of months,
p391
aVthe team at StoryCorps has been working furiously
p392
aVto create an app that will bring StoryCorps out of our booths
p393
aVso that it can be experienced by anyone, anywhere, anytime.
p394
aVRemember, StoryCorps has always been two people and a facilitator
p395
aVhelping them record their conversation, which is preserved forever,
p396
aVbut at this very moment,
p397
aVwe're releasing a public beta version of the StoryCorps app.
p398
aVThe app is a digital facilitator that walks you through
p399
aVthe StoryCorps interview process,
p400
aVhelps you pick questions,
p401
aVand gives you all the tips you need
p402
aVto record a meaningful StoryCorps interview,
p403
aVand then with one tap upload it  to our archive at the Library of Congress.
p404
aa(lp405
VThat's the easy part, the technology.
p406
aVThe real challenge is up to you:
p407
aVto take this tool and figure out how we can use it
p408
aVall across America and around the world,
p409
aVso that instead of recording thousands of StoryCorps interviews a year,
p410
aVwe could potentially record tens of thousands
p411
aVor hundreds of thousands
p412
aVor maybe even more.
p413
aa(lp414
VImagine, for example, a national homework assignment
p415
aVwhere every high school student studying U.S. history across the country
p416
aVrecords an interview with an elder over Thanksgiving,
p417
aVso that in one single weekend
p418
aVan entire generation of American lives and experiences are captured.
p419
aV(Applause)
p420
aVOr imagine mothers on opposite sides of a conflict somewhere in the world
p421
aVsitting down not to talk about that conflict
p422
aVbut to find out who they are as people,
p423
aVand in doing so, begin to build bonds of trust;
p424
aVor that someday it becomes a tradition all over the world
p425
aVthat people are honored with a StoryCorps interview
p426
aVon their 75th birthday;
p427
aVor that people in your community
p428
aVgo into retirement homes or hospitals or homeless shelters or even prisons
p429
aVarmed with this app to honor the people least heard in our society
p430
aVand ask them who they are, what they've learned in life,
p431
aVand how they want to be remembered.
p432
aV(Applause)
p433
aa(lp434
VTen years ago, I recorded a StoryCorps interview with my dad
p435
aVwho was a psychiatrist, and became a well-known gay activist.
p436
aVThis is the picture of us at that interview.
p437
aVI never thought about that recording until a couple of years ago,
p438
aVwhen my dad, who seemed to be in perfect health
p439
aVand was still seeing patients 40 hours a week,
p440
aVwas diagnosed with cancer.
p441
aVHe passed away very suddenly a few days later.
p442
aVIt was June 28, 2012,

VI listened to that interview for the first time at three in the morning
p446
aVon the day that he died.
p447
aVI have a couple of young kids at home,
p448
aVand I knew that the only way they were going to get to know this person
p449
aVwho was such a towering figure in my life would be through that session.
p450
aVI thought I couldn't believe in StoryCorps any more deeply than I did,
p451
aVbut it was at that moment
p452
aVthat I fully and viscerally grasped the importance of making these recordings.
p453
aa(lp454
VEvery day, people come up to me
p455
aVand say, "I wish I had interviewed my father or my grandmother or my brother,
p456
aVbut I waited too long."
p457
aVNow, no one has to wait anymore.
p458
aVAt this moment,
p459
aVwhen so much of how we communicate is fleeting and inconsequential,
p460
aVjoin us in creating this digital archive
p461
aVof conversations that are enduring and important.
p462
aVHelp us create this gift to our children,
p463
aVthis testament to who we are as human beings.
p464
aVI hope you'll help us make this wish come true.
p465
aVInterview a family member, a friend or even a stranger.
p466
aVTogether, we can create an archive of the wisdom of humanity,
p467
aVand maybe in doing so,
p468
aVwe'll learn to listen a little more and shout a little less.
p469
aVMaybe these conversations will remind us what's really important.
p470
aVAnd maybe, just maybe,
p471
aVit will help us recognize that simple truth
p472
aVthat every life, every single life,
p473
aVmatters equally and infinitely.
