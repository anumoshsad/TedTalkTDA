VI didn't always love unintended consequences,
p4
aVbut I've really learned to appreciate them.
p5
aVI've learned that they're really the essence
p6
aVof what makes for progress,
p7
aVeven when they seem to be terrible.
p8
aVAnd I'd like to review
p9
aVjust how unintended consequences
p10
aVplay the part that they do.
p11
aa(lp12
VLet's go to 40,000 years before the present,
p13
aVto the time of the cultural explosion,
p14
aVwhen music, art, technology,
p15
aVso many of the things that we're enjoying today,
p16
aVso many of the things that are being demonstrated at TED
p17
aVwere born.
p18
aVAnd the anthropologist Randall White
p19
aVhas made a very interesting observation:
p20
aVthat if our ancestors
p21
aV40,000 years ago
p22
aVhad been able to see
p23
aVwhat they had done,
p24
aVthey wouldn't have really understood it.
p25
aVThey were responding
p26
aVto immediate concerns.
p27
aVThey were making it possible for us
p28
aVto do what they do,
p29
aVand yet, they didn't really understand
p30
aVhow they did it.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow let's advance to 10,000 years before the present.
p33
aVAnd this is when it really gets interesting.
p34
aVWhat about the domestication of grains?
p35
aVWhat about the origins of agriculture?
p36
aVWhat would our ancestors 10,000 years ago
p37
aVhave said
p38
aVif they really had technology assessment?
p39
aVAnd I could just imagine the committees
p40
aVreporting back to them
p41
aVon where agriculture was going to take humanity,
p42
aVat least in the next few hundred years.
p43
aVIt was really bad news.
p44
aVFirst of all, worse nutrition,
p45
aVmaybe shorter life spans.
p46
aVIt was simply awful for women.
p47
aVThe skeletal remains from that period
p48
aVhave shown that they were grinding grain morning, noon and night.
p49
aVAnd politically, it was awful.
p50
aVIt was the beginning of a much higher degree
p51
aVof inequality among people.
p52
aVIf there had been rational technology assessment then,
p53
aVI think they very well might have said,
p54
aV"Let's call the whole thing off."
p55
aa(lp56
VEven now, our choices are having unintended effects.
p57
aVHistorically, for example,
p58
aVchopsticks \u2014 according to one Japanese anthropologist
p59
aVwho wrote a dissertation about it
p60
aVat the University of Michigan \u2014
p61
aVresulted in long-term changes
p62
aVin the dentition, in the teeth,
p63
aVof the Japanese public.
p64
aVAnd we are also changing our teeth right now.
p65
aVThere is evidence
p66
aVthat the human mouth and teeth
p67
aVare growing smaller all the time.
p68
aVThat's not necessarily a bad unintended consequence.
p69
aVBut I think from the point of view of a Neanderthal,
p70
aVthere would have been a lot of disapproval
p71
aVof the wimpish choppers that we now have.
p72
aVSo these things are kind of relative
p73
aVto where you or your ancestors happen to stand.
p74
aa(lp75
VIn the ancient world
p76
aVthere was a lot of respect for unintended consequences,
p77
aVand there was a very healthy sense of caution,
p78
aVreflected in the Tree of Knowledge,
p79
aVin Pandora's Box,
p80
aVand especially in the myth of Prometheus
p81
aVthat's been so important
p82
aVin recent metaphors about technology.
p83
aVAnd that's all very true.
p84
aVThe physicians of the ancient world \u2014
p85
aVespecially the Egyptians,
p86
aVwho started medicine as we know it \u2014
p87
aVwere very conscious
p88
aVof what they could and couldn't treat.
p89
aVAnd the translations of the surviving texts say,
p90
aV"This I will not treat. This I cannot treat."
p91
aVThey were very conscious.
p92
aVSo were the followers of Hippocrates.
p93
aVThe Hippocratic manuscripts also \u2014
p94
aVrepeatedly, according to recent studies \u2014
p95
aVshow how important it is not to do harm.
p96
aVMore recently,
p97
aVHarvey Cushing,
p98
aVwho really developed neurosurgery as we know it,
p99
aVwho changed it from a field of medicine
p100
aVthat had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery
p101
aVto one in which there was a hopeful outlook,
p102
aVhe was very conscious
p103
aVthat he was not always going to do the right thing.
p104
aVBut he did his best,
p105
aVand he kept meticulous records
p106
aVthat let him transform that branch of medicine.
p107
aa(lp108
VNow if we look forward a bit
p109
aVto the 19th century,
p110
aVwe find a new style of technology.
p111
aVWhat we find is,
p112
aVno longer simple tools,
p113
aVbut systems.
p114
aVWe find more and more
p115
aVcomplex arrangements of machines
p116
aVthat make it harder and harder
p117
aVto diagnose what's going on.
p118
aVAnd the first people who saw that
p119
aVwere the telegraphers of the mid-19th century,
p120
aVwho were the original hackers.
p121
aVThomas Edison would have been very, very comfortable
p122
aVin the atmosphere of a software firm today.
p123
aVAnd these hackers had a word
p124
aVfor those mysterious bugs in telegraph systems
p125
aVthat they called bugs.
p126
aVThat was the origin of the word "bug."
p127
aVThis consciousness, though,
p128
aVwas a little slow to seep through the general population,
p129
aVeven people who were very, very well informed.
p130
aa(lp131
VSamuel Clemens, Mark Twain,
p132
aVwas a big investor
p133
aVin the most complex machine of all times \u2014
p134
aVat least until 1918 \u2014
p135
aVregistered with the U.S. Patent Office.
p136
aVThat was the Paige typesetter.
p137
aVThe Paige typesetter
p138
aVhad 18,000 parts.
p139
aVThe patent had 64 pages of text
p140
aVand 271 figures.
p141
aVIt was such a beautiful machine
p142
aVbecause it did everything that a human being did
p143
aVin setting type \u2014
p144
aVincluding returning the type to its place,
p145
aVwhich was a very difficult thing.
p146
aVAnd Mark Twain, who knew all about typesetting,
p147
aVreally was smitten by this machine.
p148
aVUnfortunately, he was smitten in more ways than one,
p149
aVbecause it made him bankrupt,
p150
aVand he had to tour the world speaking
p151
aVto recoup his money.
p152
aVAnd this was an important thing
p153
aVabout 19th century technology,
p154
aVthat all these relationships among parts
p155
aVcould make the most brilliant idea fall apart,
p156
aVeven when judged by the most expert people.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow there is something else, though, in the early 20th century
p159
aVthat made things even more complicated.
p160
aVAnd that was that safety technology itself
p161
aVcould be a source of danger.
p162
aVThe lesson of the Titanic, for a lot of the contemporaries,
p163
aVwas that you must have enough lifeboats
p164
aVfor everyone on the ship.
p165
aVAnd this was the result
p166
aVof the tragic loss of lives
p167
aVof people who could not get into them.
p168
aVHowever, there was another case, the Eastland,
p169
aVa ship that capsized in Chicago Harbor in 1915,
p170
aVand it killed 841 people \u2014
p171
aVthat was 14 more
p172
aVthan the passenger toll of the Titanic.
p173
aVThe reason for it, in part, was
p174
aVthe extra life boats that were added
p175
aVthat made this already unstable ship
p176
aVeven more unstable.
p177
aVAnd that again proves
p178
aVthat when you're talking about unintended consequences,
p179
aVit's not that easy to know
p180
aVthe right lessons to draw.
p181
aVIt's really a question of the system, how the ship was loaded,
p182
aVthe ballast and many other things.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo the 20th century, then,
p185
aVsaw how much more complex reality was,
p186
aVbut it also saw a positive side.
p187
aVIt saw that invention
p188
aVcould actually benefit from emergencies.
p189
aVIt could benefit
p190
aVfrom tragedies.
p191
aVAnd my favorite example of that \u2014
p192
aVwhich is not really widely known
p193
aVas a technological miracle,
p194
aVbut it may be one of the greatest of all times,
p195
aVwas the scaling up of penicillin in the Second World War.
p196
aVPenicillin was discovered in 1928,
p197
aVbut even by 1940,
p198
aVno commercially and medically useful quantities of it
p199
aVwere being produced.
p200
aVA number of pharmaceutical companies were working on it.
p201
aVThey were working on it independently,
p202
aVand they weren't getting anywhere.
p203
aVAnd the Government Research Bureau
p204
aVbrought representatives together
p205
aVand told them that this is something
p206
aVthat has to be done.
p207
aVAnd not only did they do it,
p208
aVbut within two years,
p209
aVthey scaled up penicillin
p210
aVfrom preparation in one-liter flasks
p211
aVto 10,000-gallon vats.
p212
aVThat was how quickly penicillin was produced
p213
aVand became one of the greatest medical advances of all time.
p214
aVIn the Second World War, too,
p215
aVthe existence
p216
aVof solar radiation
p217
aVwas demonstrated by studies of interference
p218
aVthat was detected by the radar stations of Great Britain.
p219
aVSo there were benefits in calamities \u2014
p220
aVbenefits to pure science,
p221
aVas well as to applied science
p222
aVand medicine.
p223
aa(lp224
VNow when we come to the period after the Second World War,
p225
aVunintended consequences get even more interesting.
p226
aVAnd my favorite example of that
p227
aVoccurred beginning in 1976,
p228
aVwhen it was discovered
p229
aVthat the bacteria causing Legionnaires disease
p230
aVhad always been present in natural waters,
p231
aVbut it was the precise temperature of the water
p232
aVin heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems
p233
aVthat raised the right temperature
p234
aVfor the maximum reproduction
p235
aVof Legionella bacillus.
p236
aVWell, technology to the rescue.
p237
aVSo chemists got to work,
p238
aVand they developed a bactericide
p239
aVthat became widely used in those systems.
p240
aa(lp241
VBut something else happened in the early 1980s,
p242
aVand that was that there was a mysterious epidemic
p243
aVof failures of tape drives
p244
aVall over the United States.
p245
aVAnd IBM, which made them,
p246
aVjust didn't know what to do.
p247
aVThey commissioned a group of their best scientists
p248
aVto investigate,
p249
aVand what they found was
p250
aVthat all these tape drives
p251
aVwere located near ventilation ducts.
p252
aVWhat happened was the bactericide was formulated
p253
aVwith minute traces of tin.
p254
aVAnd these tin particles were deposited on the tape heads
p255
aVand were crashing the tape heads.
p256
aVSo they reformulated the bactericide.
p257
aVBut what's interesting to me
p258
aVis that this was the first case
p259
aVof a mechanical device
p260
aVsuffering, at least indirectly, from a human disease.
p261
aVSo it shows that we're really all in this together.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
VIn fact, it also shows something interesting,
p266
aVthat although our capabilities and technology
p267
aVhave been expanding geometrically,
p268
aVunfortunately, our ability to model their long-term behavior,
p269
aVwhich has also been increasing,
p270
aVhas been increasing only arithmetically.
p271
aVSo one of the characteristic problems of our time
p272
aVis how to close this gap
p273
aVbetween capabilities and foresight.
p274
aVOne other very positive consequence
p275
aVof 20th century technology, though,
p276
aVwas the way in which other kinds of calamities
p277
aVcould lead to positive advances.
p278
aVThere are two historians of business
p279
aVat the University of Maryland,
p280
aVBrent Goldfarb and David Kirsch,
p281
aVwho have done some extremely interesting work,
p282
aVmuch of it still unpublished,
p283
aVon the history of major innovations.
p284
aVThey have combined the list of major innovations,
p285
aVand they've discovered that the greatest number, the greatest decade,
p286
aVfor fundamental innovations,
p287
aVas reflected in all of the lists that others have made \u2014
p288
aVa number of lists that they have merged \u2014
p289
aVwas the Great Depression.
p290
aa(lp291
VAnd nobody knows just why this was so,
p292
aVbut one story can reflect something of it.
p293
aVIt was the origin of the Xerox copier,
p294
aVwhich celebrated its 50th anniversary
p295
aVlast year.
p296
aVAnd Chester Carlson, the inventor,
p297
aVwas a patent attorney.
p298
aVHe really was not intending
p299
aVto work in patent research,
p300
aVbut he couldn't really find an alternative technical job.
p301
aVSo this was the best job he could get.
p302
aVHe was upset by the low quality and high cost
p303
aVof existing patent reproductions,
p304
aVand so he started to develop
p305
aVa system of dry photocopying,
p306
aVwhich he patented in the late 1930s \u2014
p307
aVand which became the first dry photocopier
p308
aVthat was commercially practical
p309
aVin 1960.
p310
aVSo we see that sometimes,
p311
aVas a result of these dislocations,
p312
aVas a result of people
p313
aVleaving their original intended career
p314
aVand going into something else
p315
aVwhere their creativity could make a difference,
p316
aVthat depressions
p317
aVand all kinds of other unfortunate events
p318
aVcan have a paradoxically stimulating effect
p319
aVon creativity.
p320
aa(lp321
VWhat does this mean?
p322
aVIt means, I think,
p323
aVthat we're living in a time of unexpected possibilities.
p324
aVThink of the financial world, for example.
p325
aVThe mentor of Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham,
p326
aVdeveloped his system of value investing
p327
aVas a result of his own losses
p328
aVin the 1929 crash.
p329
aVAnd he published that book
p330
aVin the early 1930s,
p331
aVand the book still exists in further editions
p332
aVand is still a fundamental textbook.
p333
aVSo many important creative things can happen
p334
aVwhen people learn from disasters.
p335
aa(lp336
VNow think of the large and small plagues that we have now \u2014
p337
aVbed bugs, killer bees, spam \u2014
p338
aVand it's very possible that the solutions to those
p339
aVwill really extend well beyond the immediate question.
p340
aVIf we think, for example, of Louis Pasteur,
p341
aVwho in the 1860s
p342
aVwas asked to study
p343
aVthe diseases of silk worms for the silk industry,
p344
aVand his discoveries were really the beginning
p345
aVof the germ theory of disease.
p346
aVSo very often, some kind of disaster \u2014
p347
aVsometimes the consequence, for example,
p348
aVof over-cultivation of silk worms,
p349
aVwhich was a problem in Europe at the time \u2014
p350
aVcan be the key to something much bigger.
p351
aa(lp352
VSo this means
p353
aVthat we need to take a different view
p354
aVof unintended consequences.
p355
aVWe need to take a really positive view.
p356
aVWe need to see what they can do for us.
p357
aVWe need to learn
p358
aVfrom those figures that I mentioned.
p359
aVWe need to learn, for example, from Dr. Cushing,
p360
aVwho killed patients
p361
aVin the course of his early operations.
p362
aVHe had to have some errors. He had to have some mistakes.
p363
aVAnd he learned meticulously from his mistakes.
p364
aVAnd as a result,
p365
aVwhen we say, "This isn't brain surgery,"
p366
aVthat pays tribute to how difficult it was
p367
aVfor anyone to learn from their mistakes
p368
aVin a field of medicine
p369
aVthat was considered so discouraging in its prospects.
p370
aVAnd we can also remember
p371
aVhow the pharmaceutical companies
p372
aVwere willing to pool their knowledge,
p373
aVto share their knowledge,
p374
aVin the face of an emergency,
p375
aVwhich they hadn't really been for years and years.
p376
aVThey might have been able to do it earlier.
p377
aa(lp378
VThe message, then, for me,
p379
aVabout unintended consequences
p380
aVis chaos happens;
p381
aVlet's make better use of it.
p382
aa(lp383
