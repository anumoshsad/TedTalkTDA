VSo, if you're in the audience today,
p4
aVor maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place,
p5
aVyou are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem.
p6
aVWhether you're an artist, a technologist,
p7
aVa lawyer or a fan,
p8
aVthe handling of copyright directly impacts your life.
p9
aVRights management is no longer
p10
aVsimply a question of ownership,
p11
aVit's a complex web of relationships
p12
aVand a critical part of our cultural landscape.
p13
aVYouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners,
p14
aVbut in order to give them choices about what they can do
p15
aVwith copies, mashups and more,
p16
aVwe need to first identify
p17
aVwhen copyrighted material is uploaded to our site.
p18
aa(lp19
VLet's look at a specific video so you can see how it works.
p20
aVTwo years ago, recording artist Chris Brown
p21
aVreleased the official video of his single "Forever."
p22
aVA fan saw it on TV,
p23
aVrecorded it with her camera phone,
p24
aVand uploaded it to YouTube.
p25
aVBecause Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's video
p26
aVin our Content ID system,
p27
aVwithin seconds of attempting to upload the video,
p28
aVthe copy was detected,
p29
aVgiving Sony the choice of what to do next.
p30
aa(lp31
VBut how do we know that the user's video was a copy?
p32
aVWell, it starts with content owners
p33
aVdelivering assets into our database,
p34
aValong with a usage policy
p35
aVthat tells us what to do when we find a match.
p36
aVWe compare each upload
p37
aVagainst all of the reference files in our database.
p38
aVThis heat map is going to show you
p39
aVhow the brain of the system works.
p40
aVHere we can see the original reference file
p41
aVbeing compared to the user generated content.
p42
aVThe system compares every moment
p43
aVof one to the other to see if there's a match.
p44
aVThis means that we can identify a match
p45
aVeven if the copy used is just a portion of the original file,
p46
aVplays it in slow motion
p47
aVand has degraded audio and video quality.
p48
aVAnd we do this every time
p49
aVthat a video is uploaded to YouTube.
p50
aVAnd that's over 20 hours of video every minute.
p51
aVWhen we find a match,
p52
aVwe apply the policy that the rights owner has set down.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd the scale and the speed of this system
p55
aVis truly breathtaking.
p56
aVWe're not just talking about a few videos,
p57
aVwe're talking about over
p58
aV100 years of video every day,
p59
aVbetween new uploads and the legacy scans
p60
aVwe regularly do across all of the content on the site.
p61
aVWhen we compare those hundred years of video,
p62
aVwe're comparing it against millions
p63
aVof reference files in our database.
p64
aVIt would be like 36,000 people
p65
aVstaring at 36,000 monitors
p66
aVeach and every day, without so much as a coffee break.
p67
aa(lp68
VNow, what do we do when we find a match?
p69
aVWell, most rights owners, instead of blocking,
p70
aVwill allow the copy to be published.
p71
aVAnd then they benefit through the exposure,
p72
aVadvertising and linked sales.
p73
aVRemember Chris Brown's video "Forever"?
p74
aVWell, it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts,
p75
aVand that looked like the end of the story,
p76
aVbut sometime last year, a young couple got married.
p77
aVThis is their wedding video.
p78
aVYou may have seen it.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Music)
p81
aa(lp82
VWhat's amazing about this is,
p83
aVif the processional of the wedding was this much fun,
p84
aVcan you imagine how much fun the reception must have been?
p85
aVI mean, who are these people?
p86
aVI totally want to go to that wedding.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo their little wedding video went on
p89
aVto get over 40 million views.
p90
aVAnd instead of Sony blocking,
p91
aVthey allowed the upload to occur.
p92
aVAnd they put advertising against it
p93
aVand linked from it to iTunes.
p94
aVAnd the song, 18 months old,
p95
aVwent back to number four on the iTunes charts.
p96
aVSo Sony is generating revenue from both of these.
p97
aVAnd Jill and Kevin, the happy couple,
p98
aVthey came back from their honeymoon
p99
aVand found that their video had gone crazy viral.
p100
aVAnd they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows,
p101
aVand they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference.
p102
aVThe video's inspired over 26,000 dollars in donations
p103
aVto end domestic violence.
p104
aVThe "JK Wedding [Entrance] Dance" became so popular
p105
aVthat NBC parodied it on the season finale of "The Office,"
p106
aVwhich just goes to show,
p107
aVit's truly an ecosystem of culture.
p108
aVBecause it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios,
p109
aVbut sometimes big studios borrowing back.
p110
aa(lp111
VBy empowering choice, we can create a culture of opportunity.
p112
aVAnd all it took to change things around
p113
aVwas to allow for choice through rights identification.
p114
aVSo why has no one ever solved this problem before?
p115
aVIt's because it's a big problem,
p116
aVand it's complicated and messy.
p117
aVIt's not uncommon for a single video
p118
aVto have multiple rights owners.
p119
aVThere's musical labels.
p120
aVThere's multiple music publishers.
p121
aVAnd each of these can vary by country.
p122
aVThere's lots of cases
p123
aVwhere we have more than one work mashed together.
p124
aVSo we have to manage many claims
p125
aVto the same video.
p126
aa(lp127
VYouTube's Content ID system addresses all of these cases.
p128
aVBut the system only works through
p129
aVthe participation of rights owners.
p130
aVIf you have content that others are uploading to YouTube,
p131
aVyou should register in the Content ID system,
p132
aVand then you'll have the choice
p133
aVabout how your content is used.
p134
aVAnd think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content.
p135
aVBy simply blocking all reuse,
p136
aVyou'll miss out on new art forms,
p137
aVnew audiences,
p138
aVnew distribution channels
p139
aVand new revenue streams.
p140
aa(lp141
VBut it's not just about dollars and impressions.
p142
aVJust look at all the joy
p143
aVthat was spread through progressive rights management
p144
aVand new technology.
p145
aVAnd I think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading.
p146
aa(lp147
VThank you.
