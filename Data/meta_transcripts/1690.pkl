VNow, extinction is a different kind of death.
p4
aVIt's bigger.
p5
aVWe didn't really realize that until 1914,
p6
aVwhen the last passenger pigeon, a female named Martha,
p7
aVdied at the Cincinnati zoo.
p8
aVThis had been the most abundant bird in the world
p9
aVthat'd been in North America for six million years.
p10
aVSuddenly it wasn't here at all.
p11
aVFlocks that were a mile wide and 400 miles long
p12
aVused to darken the sun.
p13
aVAldo Leopold said this was a biological storm,
p14
aVa feathered tempest.
p15
aVAnd indeed it was a keystone species
p16
aVthat enriched the entire eastern deciduous forest,
p17
aVfrom the Mississippi to the Atlantic,
p18
aVfrom Canada down to the Gulf.
p19
aVBut it went from five billion birds to zero in just a couple decades.
p20
aVWhat happened?
p21
aa(lp22
VWell, commercial hunting happened.
p23
aVThese birds were hunted for meat that was sold by the ton,
p24
aVand it was easy to do because when those big flocks
p25
aVcame down to the ground, they were so dense
p26
aVthat hundreds of hunters and netters could show up
p27
aVand slaughter them by the tens of thousands.
p28
aVIt was the cheapest source of protein in America.
p29
aVBy the end of the century, there was nothing left
p30
aVbut these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers.
p31
aa(lp32
VThere's an upside to the story.
p33
aVThis made people realize that the same thing
p34
aVwas about to happen to the American bison,
p35
aVand so these birds saved the buffalos.
p36
aa(lp37
VBut a lot of other animals weren't saved.
p38
aVThe Carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere.
p39
aVIt was hunted to death for its feathers.
p40
aVThere was a bird that people liked on the East Coast called the heath hen.
p41
aVIt was loved. They tried to protect it. It died anyway.
p42
aVA local newspaper spelled out, "There is no survivor,
p43
aVthere is no future, there is no life to be recreated in this form ever again."
p44
aVThere's a sense of deep tragedy that goes with these things,
p45
aVand it happened to lots of birds that people loved.
p46
aVIt happened to lots of mammals.
p47
aVAnother keystone species is a famous animal
p48
aVcalled the European aurochs.
p49
aVThere was sort of a movie made about it recently.
p50
aVAnd the aurochs was like the bison.
p51
aVThis was an animal that basically kept the forest
p52
aVmixed with grasslands across the entire Europe and Asian continent,
p53
aVfrom Spain to Korea.
p54
aVThe documentation of this animal goes back
p55
aVto the Lascaux cave paintings.
p56
aa(lp57
VThe extinctions still go on.
p58
aVThere's an ibex in Spain called the bucardo.
p59
aVIt went extinct in 2000.
p60
aVThere was a marvelous animal, a marsupial wolf
p61
aVcalled the thylacine in Tasmania, south of Australia,
p62
aVcalled the Tasmanian tiger.
p63
aVIt was hunted until there were just a few left to die in zoos.
p64
aVA little bit of film was shot.
p65
aa(lp66
VSorrow, anger, mourning.
p67
aVDon't mourn. Organize.
p68
aVWhat if you could find out that, using the DNA in museum specimens,
p69
aVfossils maybe up to 200,000 years old
p70
aVcould be used to bring species back,
p71
aVwhat would you do? Where would you start?
p72
aa(lp73
VWell, you'd start by finding out if the biotech is really there.
p74
aVI started with my wife, Ryan Phelan,
p75
aVwho ran a biotech business called DNA Direct,
p76
aVand through her, one of her colleagues, George Church,
p77
aVone of the leading genetic engineers
p78
aVwho turned out to be also obsessed with passenger pigeons
p79
aVand a lot of confidence
p80
aVthat methodologies he was working on
p81
aVmight actually do the deed.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo he and Ryan organized and hosted a meeting
p84
aVat the Wyss Institute in Harvard bringing together
p85
aVspecialists on passenger pigeons, conservation ornithologists, bioethicists,
p86
aVand fortunately passenger pigeon DNA had already been sequenced
p87
aVby a molecular biologist named Beth Shapiro.
p88
aVAll she needed from those specimens at the Smithsonian
p89
aVwas a little bit of toe pad tissue,
p90
aVbecause down in there is what is called ancient DNA.
p91
aVIt's DNA which is pretty badly fragmented,
p92
aVbut with good techniques now, you can basically reassemble the whole genome.
p93
aa(lp94
VThen the question is, can you reassemble,
p95
aVwith that genome, the whole bird?
p96
aVGeorge Church thinks you can.
p97
aVSo in his book, "Regenesis," which I recommend,
p98
aVhe has a chapter on the science of bringing back extinct species,
p99
aVand he has a machine called
p100
aVthe Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering machine.
p101
aVIt's kind of like an evolution machine.
p102
aVYou try combinations of genes that you write
p103
aVat the cell level and then in organs on a chip,
p104
aVand the ones that win, that you can then put
p105
aVinto a living organism. It'll work.
p106
aVThe precision of this, one of George's famous unreadable slides,
p107
aVnevertheless points out that there's a level of precision here
p108
aVright down to the individual base pair.
p109
aVThe passenger pigeon has 1.3 billion base pairs in its genome.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo what you're getting is the capability now
p112
aVof replacing one gene with another variation of that gene.
p113
aVIt's called an allele.
p114
aVWell that's what happens in normal hybridization anyway.
p115
aVSo this is a form of synthetic hybridization of the genome
p116
aVof an extinct species
p117
aVwith the genome of its closest living relative.
p118
aVNow along the way, George points out that
p119
aVhis technology, the technology of synthetic biology,
p120
aVis currently accelerating at four times the rate of Moore's Law.
p121
aVIt's been doing that since 2005, and it's likely to continue.
p122
aa(lp123
VOkay, the closest living relative of the passenger pigeon
p124
aVis the band-tailed pigeon. They're abundant. There's some around here.
p125
aVGenetically, the band-tailed pigeon already is
p126
aVmostly living passenger pigeon.
p127
aVThere's just some bits that are band-tailed pigeon.
p128
aVIf you replace those bits with passenger pigeon bits,
p129
aVyou've got the extinct bird back, cooing at you.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow, there's work to do.
p132
aVYou have to figure out exactly what genes matter.
p133
aVSo there's genes for the short tail in the band-tailed pigeon,
p134
aVgenes for the long tail in the passenger pigeon,
p135
aVand so on with the red eye, peach-colored breast, flocking, and so on.
p136
aVAdd them all up and the result won't be perfect.
p137
aVBut it should be be perfect enough,
p138
aVbecause nature doesn't do perfect either.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo this meeting in Boston led to three things.
p141
aa(lp142
VFirst off, Ryan and I decided to create a nonprofit
p143
aVcalled Revive and Restore that would push de-extinction generally
p144
aVand try to have it go in a responsible way,
p145
aVand we would push ahead with the passenger pigeon.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnother direct result was a young grad student named Ben Novak,
p148
aVwho had been obsessed with passenger pigeons since he was 14
p149
aVand had also learned how to work with ancient DNA,
p150
aVhimself sequenced the passenger pigeon,
p151
aVusing money from his family and friends.
p152
aVWe hired him full-time.
p153
aVNow, this photograph I took of him last year at the Smithsonian,
p154
aVhe's looking down at Martha,
p155
aVthe last passenger pigeon alive.
p156
aVSo if he's successful, she won't be the last.
p157
aa(lp158
VThe third result of the Boston meeting was the realization
p159
aVthat there are scientists all over the world
p160
aVworking on various forms of de-extinction,
p161
aVbut they'd never met each other.
p162
aVAnd National Geographic got interested
p163
aVbecause National Geographic has the theory that
p164
aVthe last century, discovery was basically finding things,
p165
aVand in this century, discovery is basically making things.
p166
aVDe-extinction falls in that category.
p167
aVSo they hosted and funded this meeting. And 35 scientists,
p168
aVthey were conservation biologists and molecular biologists,
p169
aVbasically meeting to see if they had work to do together.
p170
aVSome of these conservation biologists are pretty radical.
p171
aVThere's three of them who are not just re-creating ancient species,
p172
aVthey're recreating extinct ecosystems
p173
aVin northern Siberia, in the Netherlands, and in Hawaii.
p174
aa(lp175
VHenri, from the Netherlands,
p176
aVwith a Dutch last name I won't try to pronounce,
p177
aVis working on the aurochs.
p178
aVThe aurochs is the ancestor of all domestic cattle,
p179
aVand so basically its genome is alive, it's just unevenly distributed.
p180
aVSo what they're doing is working with seven breeds
p181
aVof primitive, hardy-looking cattle like that Maremmana primitivo on the top there
p182
aVto rebuild, over time, with selective back-breeding,
p183
aVthe aurochs.
p184
aVNow, re-wilding is moving faster in Korea
p185
aVthan it is in America,
p186
aVand so the plan is, with these re-wilded areas all over Europe,
p187
aVthey will introduce the aurochs to do its old job,
p188
aVits old ecological role,
p189
aVof clearing the somewhat barren, closed-canopy forest
p190
aVso that it has these biodiverse meadows in it.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnother amazing story
p193
aVcame from Alberto Fernández-Arias.
p194
aVAlberto worked with the bucardo in Spain.
p195
aVThe last bucardo was a female named Celia
p196
aVwho was still alive, but then they captured her,
p197
aVthey got a little bit of tissue from her ear,
p198
aVthey cryopreserved it in liquid nitrogen,
p199
aVreleased her back into the wild,
p200
aVbut a few months later, she was found dead under a fallen tree.
p201
aVThey took the DNA from that ear,
p202
aVthey planted it as a cloned egg in a goat,
p203
aVthe pregnancy came to term,
p204
aVand a live baby bucardo was born.
p205
aVIt was the first de-extinction in history.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Applause)
p208
aa(lp209
VIt was short-lived.
p210
aVSometimes interspecies clones have respiration problems.
p211
aVThis one had a malformed lung and died after 10 minutes,
p212
aVbut Alberto was confident that
p213
aVcloning has moved along well since then,
p214
aVand this will move ahead, and eventually
p215
aVthere will be a population of bucardos
p216
aVback in the mountains in northern Spain.
p217
aa(lp218
VCryopreservation pioneer of great depth is Oliver Ryder.
p219
aVAt the San Diego zoo, his frozen zoo
p220
aVhas collected the tissues from over 1,000 species
p221
aVover the last 35 years.
p222
aVNow, when it's frozen that deep,
p223
aVminus 196 degrees Celsius,
p224
aVthe cells are intact and the DNA is intact.
p225
aVThey're basically viable cells,
p226
aVso someone like Bob Lanza at Advanced Cell Technology
p227
aVtook some of that tissue from an endangered animal
p228
aVcalled the Javan banteng, put it in a cow,
p229
aVthe cow went to term, and what was born
p230
aVwas a live, healthy baby Javan banteng,
p231
aVwho thrived and is still alive.
p232
aa(lp233
VThe most exciting thing for Bob Lanza
p234
aVis the ability now to take any kind of cell
p235
aVwith induced pluripotent stem cells
p236
aVand turn it into germ cells, like sperm and eggs.
p237
aa(lp238
VSo now we go to Mike McGrew
p239
aVwho is a scientist at Roslin Institute in Scotland,
p240
aVand Mike's doing miracles with birds.
p241
aVSo he'll take, say, falcon skin cells, fibroblast,
p242
aVturn it into induced pluripotent stem cells.
p243
aVSince it's so pluripotent, it can become germ plasm.
p244
aVHe then has a way to put the germ plasm
p245
aVinto the embryo of a chicken egg
p246
aVso that that chicken will have, basically,
p247
aVthe gonads of a falcon.
p248
aVYou get a male and a female each of those,
p249
aVand out of them comes falcons.
p250
aV(Laughter)
p251
aVReal falcons out of slightly doctored chickens.
p252
aa(lp253
VBen Novak was the youngest scientist at the meeting.
p254
aVHe showed how all of this can be put together.
p255
aVThe sequence of events: he'll put together the genomes
p256
aVof the band-tailed pigeon and the passenger pigeon,
p257
aVhe'll take the techniques of George Church
p258
aVand get passenger pigeon DNA,
p259
aVthe techniques of Robert Lanza and Michael McGrew,
p260
aVget that DNA into chicken gonads,
p261
aVand out of the chicken gonads get passenger pigeon eggs, squabs,
p262
aVand now you're getting a population of passenger pigeons.
p263
aa(lp264
VIt does raise the question of,
p265
aVthey're not going to have passenger pigeon parents
p266
aVto teach them how to be a passenger pigeon.
p267
aVSo what do you do about that?
p268
aVWell birds are pretty hard-wired, as it happens,
p269
aVso most of that is already in their DNA,
p270
aVbut to supplement it, part of Ben's idea
p271
aVis to use homing pigeons
p272
aVto help train the young passenger pigeons how to flock
p273
aVand how to find their way to their old nesting grounds
p274
aVand feeding grounds.
p275
aa(lp276
VThere were some conservationists,
p277
aVreally famous conservationists like Stanley Temple,
p278
aVwho is one of the founders of conservation biology,
p279
aVand Kate Jones from the IUCN, which does the Red List.
p280
aVThey're excited about all this,
p281
aVbut they're also concerned that it might be competitive
p282
aVwith the extremely important efforts to protect
p283
aVendangered species that are still alive,
p284
aVthat haven't gone extinct yet.
p285
aVYou see, you want to work on protecting the animals out there.
p286
aVYou want to work on getting the market for ivory in Asia down
p287
aVso you're not using 25,000 elephants a year.
p288
aa(lp289
VBut at the same time, conservation biologists are realizing
p290
aVthat bad news bums people out.
p291
aVAnd so the Red List is really important, keep track of
p292
aVwhat's endangered and critically endangered, and so on.
p293
aVBut they're about to create what they call a Green List,
p294
aVand the Green List will have species that are doing fine, thank you,
p295
aVspecies that were endangered, like the bald eagle,
p296
aVbut they're much better off now, thanks to everybody's good work,
p297
aVand protected areas around the world
p298
aVthat are very, very well managed.
p299
aVSo basically, they're learning how to build on good news.
p300
aVAnd they see reviving extinct species
p301
aVas the kind of good news you might be able to build on.
p302
aa(lp303
VHere's a couple related examples.
p304
aVCaptive breeding will be a major part of bringing back these species.
p305
aVThe California condor was down to 22 birds in 1987.
p306
aVEverybody thought is was finished.
p307
aVThanks to captive breeding at the San Diego Zoo,
p308
aVthere's 405 of them now, 226 are out in the wild.
p309
aVThat technology will be used on de-extincted animals.
p310
aVAnother success story is the mountain gorilla in Central Africa.
p311
aVIn 1981, Dian Fossey was sure they were going extinct.
p312
aVThere were just 254 left.
p313
aVNow there are 880. They're increasing in population
p314
aVby three percent a year.
p315
aVThe secret is, they have an eco-tourism program,
p316
aVwhich is absolutely brilliant.
p317
aVSo this photograph was taken last month by Ryan
p318
aVwith an iPhone.
p319
aVThat's how comfortable these wild gorillas are with visitors.
p320
aa(lp321
VAnother interesting project, though it's going to need some help,
p322
aVis the northern white rhinoceros.
p323
aVThere's no breeding pairs left.
p324
aVBut this is the kind of thing that
p325
aVa wide variety of DNA for this animal is available in the frozen zoo.
p326
aVA bit of cloning, you can get them back.
p327
aa(lp328
VSo where do we go from here?
p329
aVThese have been private meetings so far.
p330
aVI think it's time for the subject to go public.
p331
aVWhat do people think about it?
p332
aVYou know, do you want extinct species back?
p333
aVDo you want extinct species back?
p334
aa(lp335
V(Applause)
p336
aa(lp337
VTinker Bell is going to come fluttering down.
p338
aVIt is a Tinker Bell moment,
p339
aVbecause what are people excited about with this?
p340
aVWhat are they concerned about?
p341
aa(lp342
VWe're also going to push ahead with the passenger pigeon.
p343
aVSo Ben Novak, even as we speak, is joining the group
p344
aVthat Beth Shapiro has at UC Santa Cruz.
p345
aVThey're going to work on the genomes
p346
aVof the passenger pigeon and the band-tailed pigeon.
p347
aVAs that data matures, they'll send it to George Church,
p348
aVwho will work his magic, get passenger pigeon DNA out of that.
p349
aVWe'll get help from Bob Lanza and Mike McGrew
p350
aVto get that into germ plasm that can go into chickens
p351
aVthat can produce passenger pigeon squabs
p352
aVthat can be raised by band-tailed pigeon parents,
p353
aVand then from then on, it's passenger pigeons all the way,
p354
aVmaybe for the next six million years.
p355
aVYou can do the same thing, as the costs come down,
p356
aVfor the Carolina parakeet, for the great auk,
p357
aVfor the heath hen, for the ivory-billed woodpecker,
p358
aVfor the Eskimo curlew, for the Caribbean monk seal,
p359
aVfor the woolly mammoth.
p360
aa(lp361
VBecause the fact is, humans have made a huge hole
p362
aVin nature in the last 10,000 years.
p363
aVWe have the ability now,
p364
aVand maybe the moral obligation, to repair some of the damage.
p365
aVMost of that we'll do by expanding and protecting wildlands,
p366
aVby expanding and protecting
p367
aVthe populations of endangered species.
p368
aVBut some species
p369
aVthat we killed off totally
p370
aVwe could consider bringing back
p371
aVto a world that misses them.
p372
aa(lp373
VThank you.
p374
aa(lp375
V(Applause)
p376
aa(lp377
VChris Anderson: Thank you.
p378
aVI've got a question.
p379
aVSo, this is an emotional topic. Some people stand.
p380
aVI suspect there are some people out there sitting,
p381
aVkind of asking tormented questions, almost, about,
p382
aVwell, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute,
p383
aVthere's something wrong with mankind
p384
aVinterfering in nature in this way.
p385
aVThere's going to be unintended consequences.
p386
aVYou're going to uncork some sort of Pandora's box
p387
aVof who-knows-what. Do they have a point?
p388
aa(lp389
VStewart Brand: Well, the earlier point is
p390
aVwe interfered in a big way by making these animals go extinct,
p391
aVand many of them were keystone species,
p392
aVand we changed the whole ecosystem they were in
p393
aVby letting them go.
p394
aVNow, there's the shifting baseline problem, which is,
p395
aVso when these things come back,
p396
aVthey might replace some birds that are there
p397
aVthat people really know and love.
p398
aVI think that's, you know, part of how it'll work.
p399
aVThis is a long, slow process \u2014
p400
aVOne of the things I like about it, it's multi-generation.
p401
aVWe will get woolly mammoths back.
p402
aa(lp403
VCA: Well it feels like both the conversation
p404
aVand the potential here are pretty thrilling.
p405
aVThank you so much for presenting. SB: Thank you.

VCA: Thank you. (Applause)
