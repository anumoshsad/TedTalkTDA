VI'm going to speak today about the relationship
p4
aVbetween science and human values.
p5
aVNow, it's generally understood that
p6
aVquestions of morality \u2014
p7
aVquestions of good and evil and right and wrong \u2014
p8
aVare questions about which science officially has no opinion.
p9
aVIt's thought that science can help us
p10
aVget what we value,
p11
aVbut it can never tell us what we ought to value.
p12
aVAnd, consequently, most people \u2014 I think most people
p13
aVprobably here \u2014 think that science will never answer
p14
aVthe most important questions in human life:
p15
aVquestions like, "What is worth living for?"
p16
aV"What is worth dying for?"
p17
aV"What constitutes a good life?"
p18
aa(lp19
VSo, I'm going to argue
p20
aVthat this is an illusion \u2014 that the separation between
p21
aVscience and human values is an illusion \u2014
p22
aVand actually quite a dangerous one
p23
aVat this point in human history.
p24
aVNow, it's often said that science
p25
aVcannot give us a foundation for morality and human values,
p26
aVbecause science deals with facts,
p27
aVand facts and values seem to belong to different spheres.
p28
aVIt's often thought that there's no description
p29
aVof the way the world is
p30
aVthat can tell us how the world ought to be.
p31
aVBut I think this is quite clearly untrue.
p32
aVValues are a certain kind of fact.
p33
aVThey are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures.
p34
aa(lp35
VWhy is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks?
p36
aVWhy don't we feel compassion for rocks?
p37
aVIt's because we don't think rocks can suffer. And if we're more
p38
aVconcerned about our fellow primates
p39
aVthan we are about insects, as indeed we are,
p40
aVit's because we think they're exposed to a greater range
p41
aVof potential happiness and suffering.
p42
aVNow, the crucial thing to notice here
p43
aVis that this is a factual claim:
p44
aVThis is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we
p45
aVhave misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity
p46
aVand the possibilities of experience
p47
aVwell then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd there's no notion,
p50
aVno version of human morality
p51
aVand human values that I've ever come across
p52
aVthat is not at some point reducible
p53
aVto a concern about conscious experience
p54
aVand its possible changes.
p55
aVEven if you get your values from religion,
p56
aVeven if you think that good and evil ultimately
p57
aVrelate to conditions after death \u2014
p58
aVeither to an eternity of happiness with God
p59
aVor an eternity of suffering in hell \u2014
p60
aVyou are still concerned about consciousness and its changes.
p61
aVAnd to say that such changes can persist after death
p62
aVis itself a factual claim,
p63
aVwhich, of course, may or may not be true.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow, to speak about the conditions of well-being
p66
aVin this life, for human beings,
p67
aVwe know that there is a continuum of such facts.
p68
aVWe know that it's possible to live in a failed state,
p69
aVwhere everything that can go wrong does go wrong \u2014
p70
aVwhere mothers cannot feed their children,
p71
aVwhere strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration,
p72
aVwhere people are murdered indiscriminately.
p73
aVAnd we know that it's possible to move along this continuum
p74
aVtowards something quite a bit more idyllic,
p75
aVto a place where a conference like this is even conceivable.
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd we know \u2014 we know \u2014
p78
aVthat there are right and wrong answers
p79
aVto how to move in this space.
p80
aVWould adding cholera to the water be a good idea?
p81
aVProbably not.
p82
aVWould it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye,
p83
aVso that when bad things happened to them
p84
aVthey immediately blame their neighbors? Probably not.
p85
aVThere are truths to be known
p86
aVabout how human communities flourish,
p87
aVwhether or not we understand these truths.
p88
aVAnd morality relates to these truths.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo, in talking about values we are talking about facts.
p91
aVNow, of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels \u2014
p92
aVfrom the level of the genome
p93
aVon up to the level of economic systems
p94
aVand political arrangements.
p95
aVBut if we're going to talk about human well-being
p96
aVwe are, of necessity, talking about the human brain.
p97
aVBecause we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it
p98
aVis realized in the brain \u2014
p99
aa(lp100
Vwhatever happens after death.
p101
aVEven if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife,
p102
aVin this life, his personality \u2014
p103
aVhis rather unfortunate personality \u2014
p104
aVis the product of his brain.
p105
aVSo the contributions of culture \u2014
p106
aVif culture changes us, as indeed it does,
p107
aVit changes us by changing our brains.
p108
aVAnd so therefore whatever cultural variation there is
p109
aVin how human beings flourish
p110
aVcan, at least in principle, be understood
p111
aVin the context of a maturing science of the mind \u2014
p112
aVneuroscience, psychology, etc.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo, what I'm arguing is that
p115
aVvalue's reduced to facts \u2014
p116
aVto facts about the conscious experience
p117
aVof conscious beings.
p118
aVAnd we can therefore visualize a space
p119
aVof possible changes in the experience of these beings.
p120
aVAnd I think of this as kind of a moral landscape,
p121
aVwith peaks and valleys that correspond
p122
aVto differences in the well-being of conscious creatures,
p123
aVboth personal and collective.
p124
aVAnd one thing to notice is that perhaps
p125
aVthere are states of human well-being
p126
aVthat we rarely access, that few people access.
p127
aVAnd these await our discovery.
p128
aVPerhaps some of these states can be appropriately called
p129
aVmystical or spiritual.
p130
aVPerhaps there are other states that we can't access
p131
aVbecause of how our minds are structured
p132
aVbut other minds possibly could access them.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow, let me be clear about what I'm not saying. I'm not saying
p135
aVthat science is guaranteed to map this space,
p136
aVor that we will have scientific answers to every
p137
aVconceivable moral question.
p138
aVI don't think, for instance, that you will one day consult
p139
aVa supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child,
p140
aVor whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities,
p141
aVor whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense.
p142
aV(Laughter)
p143
aVBut if questions affect human well-being
p144
aVthen they do have answers, whether or not we can find them.
p145
aVAnd just admitting this \u2014
p146
aVjust admitting that there are right and wrong answers
p147
aVto the question of how humans flourish \u2014
p148
aVwill change the way we talk about morality,
p149
aVand will change our expectations
p150
aVof human cooperation in the future.
p151
aa(lp152
VFor instance, there are 21 states in our country
p153
aVwhere corporal punishment in the classroom is legal,
p154
aVwhere it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board, hard,
p155
aVand raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin.
p156
aVAnd hundreds of thousands of children, incidentally,
p157
aVare subjected to this every year.
p158
aVThe locations of these enlightened districts, I think, will fail to surprise you.
p159
aVWe're not talking about Connecticut.
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious.
p162
aVThe creator of the universe himself
p163
aVhas told us not to spare the rod,
p164
aVlest we spoil the child \u2014
p165
aVthis is in Proverbs 13 and 20, and I believe, 23.
p166
aVBut we can ask the obvious question:
p167
aVIs it a good idea, generally speaking,
p168
aVto subject children to pain
p169
aVand violence and public humiliation
p170
aVas a way of encouraging healthy emotional development
p171
aVand good behavior?
p172
aV(Laughter)
p173
aVIs there any doubt
p174
aVthat this question has an answer,
p175
aVand that it matters?
p176
aa(lp177
VNow, many of you might worry
p178
aVthat the notion of well-being is truly undefined,
p179
aVand seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed.
p180
aVAnd so, how therefore can there be an
p181
aVobjective notion of well-being?
p182
aVWell, consider by analogy, the concept of physical health.
p183
aVThe concept of physical health is undefined.
p184
aVAs we just heard from Michael Specter, it has changed over the years.
p185
aVWhen this statue was carved
p186
aVthe average life expectancy was probably 30.
p187
aVIt's now around 80 in the developed world.
p188
aVThere may come a time when we meddle with our genomes
p189
aVin such a way that not being able to run a marathon
p190
aVat age 200 will be considered a profound disability.
p191
aVPeople will send you donations when you're in that condition.
p192
aV(Laughter)
p193
aa(lp194
VNotice that the fact that the concept of health
p195
aVis open, genuinely open for revision,
p196
aVdoes not make it vacuous.
p197
aVThe distinction between a healthy person
p198
aVand a dead one
p199
aVis about as clear and consequential as any we make in science.
p200
aVAnother thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape:
p201
aVThere may be equivalent ways to thrive;
p202
aVthere may be equivalent ways to organize a human society
p203
aVso as to maximize human flourishing.
p204
aa(lp205
VNow, why wouldn't this
p206
aVundermine an objective morality?
p207
aVWell think of how we talk about food:
p208
aVI would never be tempted to argue to you
p209
aVthat there must be one right food to eat.
p210
aVThere is clearly a range of materials
p211
aVthat constitute healthy food.
p212
aVBut there's nevertheless a clear distinction
p213
aVbetween food and poison.
p214
aVThe fact that there are many right answers
p215
aVto the question, "What is food?"
p216
aVdoes not tempt us
p217
aVto say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition.
p218
aVMany people worry
p219
aVthat a universal morality would require
p220
aVmoral precepts that admit of no exceptions.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo, for instance, if it's really wrong to lie,
p223
aVit must always be wrong to lie,
p224
aVand if you can find an exception,
p225
aVwell then there's no such thing as moral truth.
p226
aVWhy would we think this?
p227
aVConsider, by analogy, the game of chess.
p228
aVNow, if you're going to play good chess,
p229
aVa principle like, "Don't lose your Queen,"
p230
aVis very good to follow.
p231
aVBut it clearly admits some exceptions.
p232
aVThere are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do.
p233
aVThere are moments when it is the only good thing you can do.
p234
aVAnd yet, chess is a domain of perfect objectivity.
p235
aVThe fact that there are exceptions here does not
p236
aVchange that at all.
p237
aa(lp238
VNow, this brings us to the sorts of moves
p239
aVthat people are apt to make in the moral sphere.
p240
aVConsider the great problem of women's bodies:
p241
aVWhat to do about them?
p242
aVWell this is one thing you can do about them:
p243
aVYou can cover them up.
p244
aVNow, it is the position, generally speaking, of our intellectual community
p245
aVthat while we may not like this,
p246
aVwe might think of this as "wrong"
p247
aVin Boston or Palo Alto,
p248
aVwho are we to say
p249
aVthat the proud denizens of an ancient culture
p250
aVare wrong to force their wives and daughters
p251
aVto live in cloth bags?
p252
aVAnd who are we to say, even, that they're wrong
p253
aVto beat them with lengths of steel cable,
p254
aVor throw battery acid in their faces
p255
aVif they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way?
p256
aa(lp257
VWell, who are we not to say this?
p258
aVWho are we to pretend
p259
aVthat we know so little about human well-being
p260
aVthat we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this?
p261
aVI'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil \u2014
p262
aVwomen should be able to wear whatever they want, as far as I'm concerned.
p263
aVBut what does voluntary mean
p264
aVin a community where,
p265
aVwhen a girl gets raped,
p266
aVher father's first impulse,
p267
aVrather often, is to murder her out of shame?
p268
aa(lp269
VJust let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute:
p270
aVYour daughter gets raped,
p271
aVand what you want to do is kill her.
p272
aVWhat are the chances that represents
p273
aVa peak of human flourishing?
p274
aa(lp275
VNow, to say this is not to say that we have got the
p276
aVperfect solution in our own society.
p277
aVFor instance,
p278
aVthis is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere
p279
aVin the civilized world.
p280
aVNow, granted, for many men
p281
aVit may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images.
p282
aV(Laughter)
p283
aVBut if we are in a reflective mood,
p284
aVwe can ask,
p285
aV"Is this the perfect expression
p286
aVof psychological balance
p287
aVwith respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies?"
p288
aVI mean, is this the optimal environment
p289
aVin which to raise our children?
p290
aVProbably not. OK, so perhaps there's some place
p291
aVon the spectrum
p292
aVbetween these two extremes
p293
aVthat represents a place of better balance.
p294
aV(Applause)
p295
aVPerhaps there are many such places \u2014
p296
aa(lp297
Vagain, given other changes in human culture
p298
aVthere may be many peaks on the moral landscape.
p299
aVBut the thing to notice is that there will be
p300
aVmany more ways not to be on a peak.
p301
aVNow the irony, from my perspective,
p302
aVis that the only people who seem to generally agree with me
p303
aVand who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions
p304
aVare religious demagogues of one form or another.
p305
aa(lp306
VAnd of course they think they have right answers to moral questions
p307
aVbecause they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind,
p308
aVnot because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes
p309
aVand condition of human and animal well-being.
p310
aVIn fact, the endurance of religion
p311
aVas a lens through which most people view moral questions
p312
aVhas separated most moral talk
p313
aVfrom real questions of human and animal suffering.
p314
aVThis is why we spend our time
p315
aVtalking about things like gay marriage
p316
aVand not about genocide or nuclear proliferation
p317
aVor poverty or any other hugely consequential issue.
p318
aVBut the demagogues are right about one thing: We need
p319
aVa universal conception of human values.
p320
aa(lp321
VNow, what stands in the way of this?
p322
aVWell, one thing to notice is that we
p323
aVdo something different when talking about morality \u2014
p324
aVespecially secular, academic, scientist types.
p325
aVWhen talking about morality we value differences of opinion
p326
aVin a way that we don't in any other area of our lives.
p327
aVSo, for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning
p328
aVmeditating on compassion,
p329
aVand he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component
p330
aVof human happiness.
p331
aVOn the other hand, we have someone like Ted Bundy;
p332
aVTed Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping
p333
aVand torturing and killing young women.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo, we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion
p336
aVabout how to profitably use one's time.
p337
aV(Laughter)
p338
aVMost Western intellectuals
p339
aVlook at this situation
p340
aVand say, "Well, there's nothing for the Dalai Lama
p341
aVto be really right about \u2014 really right about \u2014
p342
aVor for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about
p343
aVthat admits of a real argument
p344
aVthat potentially falls within the purview of science.
p345
aVHe likes chocolate, he likes vanilla.
p346
aVThere's nothing that one should be able to say to the other
p347
aVthat should persuade the other."
p348
aVNotice that we don't do this in science.
p349
aa(lp350
VOn the left you have Edward Witten.
p351
aVHe's a string theorist.
p352
aVIf you ask the smartest physicists around
p353
aVwho is the smartest physicist around,
p354
aVin my experience half of them will say Ed Witten.
p355
aVThe other half will tell you they don't like the question.
p356
aV(Laughter)
p357
aVSo, what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference
p358
aVand said,"String theory is bogus.
p359
aVIt doesn't resonate with me. It's not how I chose to
p360
aVview the universe at a small scale.
p361
aVI'm not a fan."
p362
aV(Laughter)
p363
aVWell, nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist;
p364
aVI don't understand string theory.
p365
aVI'm the Ted Bundy of string theory.
p366
aV(Laughter)
p367
aVI wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member.
p368
aa(lp369
VBut this is just the point.
p370
aVWhenever we are talking about facts
p371
aVcertain opinions must be excluded.
p372
aVThat is what it is to have a domain of expertise.
p373
aVThat is what it is for knowledge to count.
p374
aVHow have we convinced ourselves
p375
aVthat in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise,
p376
aVor moral talent, or moral genius even?
p377
aVHow have we convinced ourselves
p378
aVthat every opinion has to count?
p379
aVHow have we convinced ourselves
p380
aVthat every culture has a point of view
p381
aVon these subjects worth considering?
p382
aVDoes the Taliban
p383
aVhave a point of view on physics
p384
aVthat is worth considering? No.
p385
aV(Laughter)
p386
aVHow is their ignorance any less obvious
p387
aVon the subject of human well-being?
p388
aV(Applause)
p389
aa(lp390
VSo, this, I think, is what the world needs now.
p391
aVIt needs people like ourselves to admit
p392
aVthat there are right and wrong answers
p393
aVto questions of human flourishing,
p394
aVand morality relates
p395
aVto that domain of facts.
p396
aVIt is possible
p397
aVfor individuals, and even for whole cultures,
p398
aVto care about the wrong things,
p399
aVwhich is to say that it's possible for them
p400
aVto have beliefs and desires that reliably lead
p401
aVto needless human suffering.
p402
aVJust admitting this will transform our discourse about morality.
p403
aVWe live in a world in which
p404
aVthe boundaries between nations mean less and less,
p405
aVand they will one day mean nothing.
p406
aa(lp407
VWe live in a world filled with destructive technology,
p408
aVand this technology cannot be uninvented;
p409
aVit will always be easier
p410
aVto break things than to fix them.
p411
aVIt seems to me, therefore, patently obvious
p412
aVthat we can no more
p413
aVrespect and tolerate
p414
aVvast differences in notions of human well-being
p415
aVthan we can respect or tolerate vast differences
p416
aVin the notions about how disease spreads,
p417
aVor in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes.
p418
aVWe simply must converge
p419
aVon the answers we give to the most important questions in human life.
p420
aVAnd to do that, we have to admit that these questions have answers.
p421
aVThank you very much.
p422
aV(Applause)
p423
aa(lp424
VChris Anderson: So, some combustible material there.
p425
aVWhether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world,
p426
aVhearing some of this, may well be doing the
p427
aVscreaming-with-rage thing, after as well, some of them.
p428
aa(lp429
VLanguage seems to be really important here.
p430
aVWhen you're talking about the veil,
p431
aVyou're talking about women dressed in cloth bags.
p432
aVI've lived in the Muslim world, spoken with a lot of Muslim women.
p433
aVAnd some of them would say something else. They would say,
p434
aV"No, you know, this is a celebration
p435
aVof female specialness,
p436
aVit helps build that and it's a result of the fact that" \u2014
p437
aVand this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view \u2014
p438
aV"that male lust is not to be trusted."
p439
aVI mean, can you engage in a conversation
p440
aVwith that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist?
p441
aa(lp442
VSam Harris: Yeah, well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence,
p443
aVwatching the clock ticking,
p444
aVbut the question is:
p445
aVWhat is voluntary in a context
p446
aVwhere men have certain expectations,
p447
aVand you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way
p448
aVif you don't veil yourself?
p449
aVAnd so, if anyone in this room
p450
aVwanted to wear a veil,
p451
aVor a very funny hat, or tattoo their face \u2014
p452
aVI think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want,
p453
aVbut we have to be honest about
p454
aVthe constraints that these women are placed under.
p455
aVAnd so I think we shouldn't be so eager
p456
aVto always take their word for it,
p457
aVespecially when it's 120 degrees out
p458
aVand you're wearing a full burqa.

VCA: A lot of people want to believe in this
p461
aVconcept of moral progress.
p462
aVBut can you reconcile that?
p463
aVI think I understood you to say that you could
p464
aVreconcile that with a world that doesn't become
p465
aVone dimensional, where we all have to think the same.
p466
aVPaint your picture of what
p467
aVrolling the clock 50 years forward,
p468
aV100 years forward, how you would like to think of
p469
aVthe world, balancing moral progress
p470
aVwith richness.
p471
aa(lp472
VSH: Well, I think once you admit
p473
aVthat we are on the path toward understanding our minds
p474
aVat the level of the brain in some important detail,
p475
aVthen you have to admit
p476
aVthat we are going to understand all of the positive
p477
aVand negative qualities
p478
aVof ourselves in much greater detail.
p479
aVSo, we're going to understand positive social emotion
p480
aVlike empathy and compassion,
p481
aVand we're going to understand the factors
p482
aVthat encourage it \u2014 whether they're genetic,
p483
aVwhether they're how people talk to one another,
p484
aVwhether they're economic systems,
p485
aVand insofar as we begin to shine light on that
p486
aVwe are inevitably going to converge
p487
aVon that fact space.
p488
aa(lp489
VSo, everything is not going to be up for grabs.
p490
aVIt's not going to be like
p491
aVveiling my daughter from birth
p492
aVis just as good as teaching her
p493
aVto be confident and well-educated
p494
aVin the context of men who do desire women.
p495
aVI mean I don't think we need an NSF grant to know
p496
aVthat compulsory veiling is a bad idea \u2014
p497
aVbut at a certain point
p498
aVwe're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved
p499
aVand actually interrogate them.
p500
aVDo people love their daughters
p501
aVjust as much in these systems?
p502
aVAnd I think there are clearly right answers to that.
p503
aa(lp504
VCA: And if the results come out that actually they do,
p505
aVare you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment
p506
aVon some of these issues?
p507
aa(lp508
VSH: Well yeah, modulo one obvious fact,
p509
aVthat you can love someone
p510
aVin the context of a truly delusional belief system.
p511
aVSo, you can say like, "Because I knew my gay son
p512
aVwas going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend,
p513
aVI chopped his head off. And that was the most compassionate thing I could do."
p514
aVIf you get all those parts aligned,
p515
aVyes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love.
p516
aVBut again, then we have to talk about
p517
aVwell-being in a larger context.
p518
aVIt's all of us in this together,
p519
aVnot one man feeling ecstasy
p520
aVand then blowing himself up on a bus.
p521
aa(lp522
VCA: Sam, this is a conversation I would actually love to
p523
aVcontinue for hours.
p524
aVWe don't have that, but maybe another time. Thank you for coming to TED.
p525
aa(lp526
VSH: Really an honor. Thank you.
