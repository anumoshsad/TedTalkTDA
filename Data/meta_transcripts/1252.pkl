VWhat you just heard
p6
aVare the interactions of barometric pressure, wind and temperature readings
p7
aVthat were recorded of Hurricane Noel in 2007.
p8
aVThe musicians played off a three-dimensional graph of weather data like this.
p9
aVEvery single bead, every single colored band,
p10
aVrepresents a weather element
p11
aVthat can also be read as a musical note.
p12
aVI find weather extremely fascinating.
p13
aVWeather is an amalgam of systems
p14
aVthat is inherently invisible to most of us.
p15
aVSo I use sculpture and music
p16
aVto make it, not just visible,
p17
aVbut also tactile and audible.
p18
aa(lp19
VAll of my work begins very simple.
p20
aVI extract information from a specific environment
p21
aVusing very low-tech data collecting devices \u2014
p22
aVgenerally anything I can find in the hardware store.
p23
aVI then compare my information to the things I find on the Internet \u2014
p24
aVsatellite images, weather data
p25
aVfrom weather stations as well as offshore buoys.
p26
aVThat's both historical as well as real data.
p27
aVAnd then I compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here.
p28
aVThese clipboards are filled with numbers.
p29
aVAnd from all of these numbers,
p30
aVI start with only two or three variables.
p31
aVThat begins my translation process.
p32
aa(lp33
VMy translation medium is a very simple basket.
p34
aVA basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements.
p35
aVWhen I assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements,
p36
aVI can use the changes of those data points over time
p37
aVto create the form.
p38
aVI use natural reed,
p39
aVbecause natural reed has a lot of tension in it
p40
aVthat I cannot fully control.
p41
aVThat means that it is the numbers that control the form,
p42
aVnot me.
p43
aVWhat I come up with are forms like these.
p44
aVThese forms are completely made up
p45
aVof weather data or science data.
p46
aVEvery colored bead, every colored string,
p47
aVrepresents a weather element.
p48
aVAnd together, these elements, not only construct the form,
p49
aVbut they also reveal behavioral relationships
p50
aVthat may not come across
p51
aVthrough a two-dimensional graph.
p52
aa(lp53
VWhen you step closer, you actually see
p54
aVthat it is indeed all made up of numbers.
p55
aVThe vertical elements
p56
aVare assigned a specific hour of the day.
p57
aVSo all the way around, you have a 24-hour timeline.
p58
aVBut it's also used to assign a temperature range.
p59
aVOn that grid, I can then weave the high tide readings,
p60
aVwater temperature, air temperature and Moon phases.
p61
aVI also translate weather data into musical scores.
p62
aVAnd musical notation allows me a more nuanced way
p63
aVof translating information
p64
aVwithout compromising it.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo all of these scores are made up of weather data.
p67
aVEvery single color, dot, every single line,
p68
aVis a weather element.
p69
aVAnd together, these variables construct a score.
p70
aVI use these scores to collaborate with musicians.
p71
aVThis is the 1913 Trio
p72
aVperforming one of my pieces
p73
aVat the Milwaukee Art Museum.
p74
aVMeanwhile, I use these scores as blueprints
p75
aVto translate into sculptural forms like this,
p76
aVthat function still in the sense
p77
aVof being a three-dimensional weather visualization,
p78
aVbut now they're embedding
p79
aVthe visual matrix of the musical score,
p80
aVso it can actually be read as a musical score.
p81
aa(lp82
VWhat I love about this work
p83
aVis that it challenges our assumptions
p84
aVof what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art, versus science.
p85
aVThis piece here is read very differently
p86
aVdepending on where you place it.
p87
aVYou place it in an art museum, it becomes a sculpture.
p88
aVYou place it in a science museum,
p89
aVit becomes a three-dimensional visualization of data.
p90
aVYou place it in a music hall,
p91
aVit all of a sudden becomes a musical score.
p92
aVAnd I really like that,
p93
aVbecause the viewer is really challenged
p94
aVas to what visual language
p95
aVis part of science versus art versus music.
p96
aa(lp97
VThe other reason why I really like this
p98
aVis because it offers an alternative entry point
p99
aVinto the complexity of science.
p100
aVAnd not everyone has a Ph.D. in science.
p101
aVSo for me, that was my way into it.
