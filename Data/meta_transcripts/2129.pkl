VDre Urhahn: This theater  is built on Copacabana,
p4
aVwhich is the most famous  beach in the world,
p5
aVbut 25 kilometers away from here
p6
aVin the North Zone of Rio
p7
aVlies a community called Vila Cruzeiro,
p8
aVand roughly 60,000 people live there.
p9
aVNow, the people here in Rio mostly know
p10
aVVila Cruzeiro from the news,
p11
aVand unfortunately, news  from Vila Cruzeiro often
p12
aVis not good news.
p13
aVBut Vila Cruzeiro is also the place
p14
aVwhere our story begins.
p15
aa(lp16
VJeroen Koolhaas: Ten years  ago, we first came to Rio
p17
aVto shoot a documentary  about life in the favelas.
p18
aVNow, we learned that favelas  are informal communities.
p19
aVThey emerged over the years
p20
aVwhen immigrants from the countryside
p21
aVcame to the cities looking for work,
p22
aVlike cities within the cities,
p23
aVknown for problems like crime, poverty,
p24
aVand the violent drug war between
p25
aVpolice and the drug gangs.
p26
aVSo what struck us was that
p27
aVthese were communities that the people
p28
aVwho lived there had built  with their own hands,
p29
aVwithout a master plan
p30
aVand like a giant work in progress.
p31
aVWhere we're from, in Holland,
p32
aVeverything is planned.
p33
aVWe even have rules for  how to follow the rules.
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VDU: So the last day of  filming, we ended up
p37
aVin Vila Cruzeiro, and  we were sitting down
p38
aVand we had a drink,
p39
aVand we were overlooking this hill
p40
aVwith all these houses,
p41
aVand most of these houses looked unfinished,
p42
aVand they had walls of bare brick,
p43
aVbut we saw some of these houses
p44
aVwhich were plastered and painted,
p45
aVand suddenly we had this idea:
p46
aVwhat would it look like if all these houses
p47
aVwould be plastered and painted?
p48
aVAnd then we imagined one big design,
p49
aVone big work of art.
p50
aVWho would expect something like that
p51
aVin a place like this?
p52
aVSo we thought, would that even be possible?
p53
aVSo first we started to count the houses,
p54
aVbut we soon lost count.
p55
aVBut somehow the idea stuck.
p56
aa(lp57
VJK: We had a friend.
p58
aVHe ran an NGO in Vila Cruzeiro.
p59
aVHis name was Nanko,
p60
aVand he also liked the idea.
p61
aVHe said, "You know, everybody here
p62
aVwould pretty much love  to have their houses
p63
aVplastered and painted.
p64
aVIt's when a house is finished."
p65
aVSo he introduced us to the right people,
p66
aVand Vitor and Maurinho became our crew.
p67
aVWe picked three houses in the center of the community
p68
aVand we start here. We made a few designs,
p69
aVand everybody liked this design
p70
aVof a boy flying a kite the best.
p71
aVSo we started painting,  and the first thing we did
p72
aVwas to paint everything blue,
p73
aVand we thought that looked  already pretty good.
p74
aVBut they hated it. The people who lived there really hated it.
p75
aVThey said, "What did you do?
p76
aVYou painted our house in  exactly the same color
p77
aVas the police station."
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aVIn a favela, that is not a good thing.
p80
aVAlso the same color as the prison cell.
p81
aVSo we quickly went ahead  and we painted the boy,
p82
aVand then we thought we were finished,
p83
aVwe were really happy, but still,
p84
aVit wasn't good because the little kids started coming up to us,
p85
aVand they said, "You know,  there's a boy flying the kite,
p86
aVbut where is his kite?"
p87
aVWe said, "Uh, it's art.
p88
aVYou know, you have to imagine the kite."
p89
aV(Laughter)
p90
aVAnd they said, "No, no, no,  we want to see the kite."
p91
aVSo we quickly installed a kite
p92
aVway up high on the hill,
p93
aVso that you could see  the boy flying the kite
p94
aVand you could actually see a kite.
p95
aVSo the local news started writing about it,
p96
aVwhich was great,
p97
aVand then even The Guardian wrote about it:
p98
aV"Notorious slum becomes open-air gallery."
p99
aa(lp100
VJK: So, encouraged by this success,
p101
aVwe went back to Rio for a second project,
p102
aVand we stumbled upon this street.
p103
aVIt was covered in concrete  to prevent mudslides,
p104
aVand somehow we saw a sort of river in it,
p105
aVand we imagined this river to be a river in Japanese style
p106
aVwith koi carp swimming upstream.
p107
aVSo we decided to paint that river,
p108
aVand we invited Rob Admiraal,
p109
aVwho is a tattoo artist,
p110
aVand he specialized in the Japanese style.
p111
aVSo little did we know that we would spend
p112
aValmost an entire year painting that river,
p113
aVtogether with Geovani and Robinho and Vitor,
p114
aVwho lived nearby.
p115
aVAnd we even moved into the neighborhood
p116
aVwhen one of the guys that  lived on the street, Elias,
p117
aVtold us that we could come  and live in his house,
p118
aVtogether with his family,
p119
aVwhich was fantastic.
p120
aVUnfortunately, during that time,
p121
aVanother war broke out between the police
p122
aVand the drug gangs.
p123
aV(Video) (Gunfire)
p124
aVWe learned that during those times,
p125
aVpeople in communities  really stick together
p126
aVduring these times of hardship,
p127
aVbut we also learned a  very important element,
p128
aVthe importance of barbecues.  (Laughter)
p129
aVBecause, when you throw a barbecue,
p130
aVit turns you from a guest into a host,
p131
aVso we decided to throw one
p132
aValmost every other week,
p133
aVand we got to know everybody  in the neighborhood.
p134
aa(lp135
VJK: We still had this  idea of the hill, though.
p136
aa(lp137
VDU: Yeah, yeah, we were talking about
p138
aVthe scale of this, because this painting
p139
aVwas incredibly big,
p140
aVand it was insanely detailed,
p141
aVand this process almost drove us completely insane ourselves.
p142
aVBut we figured that maybe,  during this process,
p143
aVall the time that we had  spent in the neighborhood
p144
aVwas maybe actually even more important
p145
aVthan the painting itself.
p146
aa(lp147
VJK: So after all that time,
p148
aVthis hill, this idea was still there,
p149
aVand we started to make sketches,
p150
aVmodels, and we figured something out.
p151
aVWe figured that our ideas, our designs
p152
aVhad to be a little bit more simple than that last project
p153
aVso that we could paint with more people
p154
aVand cover more houses at the same time.
p155
aVAnd we had an opportunity to try that out
p156
aVin a community in the central part of Rio,
p157
aVwhich is called Santa Marta,
p158
aVand we made a design for this place
p159
aVwhich looked like this,
p160
aVand then we got people to go along with it
p161
aVbecause turns out that if  your idea is ridiculously big,
p162
aVit's easier to get people to  go along with this. (Laughter)
p163
aVAnd the people of Santa Marta
p164
aVgot together and in a little over a month
p165
aVthey turned that square into this.
p166
aV(Applause)
p167
aVAnd this image somehow  went all over the world.
p168
aa(lp169
VDU: So then we received  an unexpected phone call
p170
aVfrom the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program,
p171
aVand they had this question
p172
aVif this idea, our approach,
p173
aVif this would actually  work in North Philly,
p174
aVwhich is one of the poorest neighborhoods
p175
aVin the United States.
p176
aVSo we immediately said yes.
p177
aVWe had no idea how,
p178
aVbut it seemed like a very  interesting challenge,
p179
aVso we did exactly the  same as we did in Rio,
p180
aVand we moved into the neighborhood
p181
aVand started barbecuing.
p182
aV(Laughter)
p183
aVSo the project took almost two years to complete,
p184
aVand we made individual designs
p185
aVfor every single house on  the avenue that we painted,
p186
aVand we made these designs together
p187
aVwith the local store owners,  the building owners,
p188
aVand a team of about a dozen  young men and women.
p189
aVThey were hired, and then they were trained as painters,
p190
aVand together they transformed their own neighborhood,
p191
aVthe whole street, into a  giant patchwork of color.
p192
aV(Applause)
p193
aVAnd at the end, the city of Philadelphia
p194
aVthanked every single one of them
p195
aVand gave them a merit for their accomplishment.
p196
aa(lp197
VJK: So now we had painted a whole street.
p198
aVHow about we do this whole hill now?
p199
aVWe started looking for funding,
p200
aVbut instead, we just ran into questions,
p201
aVlike, how many houses  are you going to paint?
p202
aVHow many square meters is that?
p203
aVHow much paint are you going to use,
p204
aVand how many people are you going to employ?
p205
aVAnd we did try for years to write plans
p206
aVfor the funding and answer  all those questions,
p207
aVbut then we thought,
p208
aVin order to answer all those questions,
p209
aVyou have to know exactly  what you're going to do
p210
aVbefore you actually get there and start.
p211
aVAnd maybe it's a mistake  to think like that.
p212
aVIt would lose some of the  magic that we had learned
p213
aVabout that if you go somewhere
p214
aVand you spend time there,
p215
aVyou can let the project grow organically
p216
aVand have a life of its own.
p217
aa(lp218
VDU: So what we did is
p219
aVwe decided to take this  plan and strip it away
p220
aVfrom all the numbers
p221
aVand all the ideas and presumptions
p222
aVand just go back to the base idea,
p223
aVwhich was to transform this hill
p224
aVinto a giant work of art.
p225
aVAnd instead of looking for funding,
p226
aVwe started a crowdfunding campaign,
p227
aVand in a little over a month,
p228
aVmore than 1,500 people put together
p229
aVand donated over 100,000 dollars.
p230
aVSo for us, this was an amazing  moment, because now \u2014
p231
aV(Applause) \u2014
p232
aVbecause now we finally had the freedom
p233
aVto use all the lessons that we had learned
p234
aVand create a project that was built
p235
aVthe same way that the favela was built,
p236
aVfrom the ground on up, bottom up,
p237
aVwith no master plan.
p238
aa(lp239
VJK: So we went back,  and we employed Angelo,
p240
aVand he's a local artist from Vila Cruzeiro,
p241
aVvery talented guy, and he knows almost everybody there,
p242
aVand then we employed Elias, our former landlord
p243
aVwho invited us into his house,
p244
aVand he's a master of construction.
p245
aVTogether with them, we decided where to start.
p246
aVWe picked this spot in Vila Cruzeiro,
p247
aVand houses are being plastered as we speak.
p248
aVAnd the good thing about them is that
p249
aVthey are deciding which houses go next.
p250
aVThey're even printing t-shirts,
p251
aVthey're putting up banners
p252
aVexplaining everything to everybody,
p253
aVand talking to the press.
p254
aVThis article about Angelo appeared.
p255
aa(lp256
VDU: So while this is happening,
p257
aVwe are bringing this  idea all over the world.
p258
aVSo, like the project we  did in Philadelphia,
p259
aVwe are also invited to do workshops,
p260
aVfor instance in Curaçao,
p261
aVand right now we're planning  a huge project in Haiti.
p262
aa(lp263
VJK: So the favela was not only the place
p264
aVwhere this idea started:
p265
aVit was also the place that made it possible
p266
aVto work without a master plan,
p267
aVbecause these communities are informal \u2014
p268
aVthis was the inspiration \u2014
p269
aVand in a communal effort,  together with the people,
p270
aVyou can almost work like in an orchestra,
p271
aVwhere you can have a hundred instruments
p272
aVplaying together to create a symphony.
p273
aa(lp274
VDU: So we want to thank everybody who
p275
aVwanted to become part of this dream
p276
aVand supported us along the way,
p277
aVand we are looking at continuing.
p278
aa(lp279
VJK: Yeah. And so one day pretty soon,
p280
aVwhen the colors start  going up on these walls,
p281
aVwe hope more people will join us,
p282
aVand join this big dream,
p283
aVand maybe one day, the  whole of Vila Cruzeiro
p284
aVwill be painted.
p285
aa(lp286
VDU: Thank you.
