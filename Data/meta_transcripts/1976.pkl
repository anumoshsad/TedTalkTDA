VThe universe is teeming with planets.
p4
aVI want us, in the next decade,
p5
aVto build a space telescope that'll be able to image
p6
aVan Earth about another star
p7
aVand figure out whether it can harbor life.
p8
aVMy colleagues at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
p9
aVat Princeton and I are working on technology
p10
aVthat will be able to do just that in the coming years.
p11
aVAstronomers now believe that every star
p12
aVin the galaxy has a planet,
p13
aVand they speculate that up to one fifth of them
p14
aVhave an Earth-like planet
p15
aVthat might be able to harbor life,
p16
aVbut we haven't seen any of them.
p17
aVWe've only detected them indirectly.
p18
aa(lp19
VThis is NASA's famous picture of the pale blue dot.
p20
aVIt was taken by the Voyager spacecraft in 1990,
p21
aVwhen they turned it around as it was exiting the solar system
p22
aVto take a picture of the Earth
p23
aVfrom six billion kilometers away.
p24
aVI want to take that
p25
aVof an Earth-like planet about another star.
p26
aa(lp27
VWhy haven't we done that? Why is that hard?
p28
aVWell to see, let's imagine we take
p29
aVthe Hubble Space Telescope
p30
aVand we turn it around and we move it out
p31
aVto the orbit of Mars.
p32
aVWe'll see something like that,
p33
aVa slightly blurry picture of the Earth,
p34
aVbecause we're a fairly small telescope
p35
aVout at the orbit of Mars.
p36
aVNow let's move ten times further away.
p37
aVHere we are at the orbit of Uranus.
p38
aVIt's gotten smaller, it's got less detail, less resolve.
p39
aVWe can still see the little moon,
p40
aVbut let's go ten times further away again.
p41
aVHere we are at the edge of the solar system,
p42
aVout at the Kuiper Belt.
p43
aVNow it's not resolved at all.
p44
aVIt's that pale blue dot of Carl Sagan's.
p45
aVBut let's move yet again ten times further away.
p46
aVHere we are out at the Oort Cloud,
p47
aVoutside the solar system,
p48
aVand we're starting to see the sun
p49
aVmove into the field of view
p50
aVand get into where the planet is.
p51
aVOne more time, ten times further away.
p52
aVNow we're at Alpha Centauri,
p53
aVour nearest neighbor star,
p54
aVand the planet is gone.
p55
aVAll we're seeing is the big beaming image of the star
p56
aVthat's ten billion times brighter than the planet,
p57
aVwhich should be in that little red circle.
p58
aVThat's what we want to see. That's why it's hard.
p59
aVThe light from the star is diffracting.
p60
aVIt's scattering inside the telescope,
p61
aVcreating that very bright image
p62
aVthat washes out the planet.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo to see the planet,
p65
aVwe have to do something about all of that light.
p66
aVWe have to get rid of it.
p67
aVI have a lot of colleagues working on
p68
aVreally amazing technologies to do that,
p69
aVbut I want to tell you about one today
p70
aVthat I think is the coolest,
p71
aVand probably the most likely to get us an Earth
p72
aVin the next decade.
p73
aa(lp74
VIt was first suggested by Lyman Spitzer,
p75
aVthe father of the space telescope, in 1962,
p76
aVand he took his inspiration from an eclipse.
p77
aVYou've all seen that. That's a solar eclipse.
p78
aVThe moon has moved in front of the sun.
p79
aVIt blocks out most of the light
p80
aVso we can see that dim corona around it.
p81
aVIt would be the same thing if I put my thumb up
p82
aVand blocked that spotlight that's getting right in my eye,
p83
aVI can see you in the back row.
p84
aVWell, what's going on?
p85
aVWell the moon
p86
aVis casting a shadow down on the Earth.
p87
aVWe put a telescope or a camera in that shadow,
p88
aVwe look back at the sun,
p89
aVand most of the light's been removed
p90
aVand we can see that dim, fine structure
p91
aVin the corona.
p92
aVSpitzer's suggestion was we do this in space.
p93
aVWe build a big screen, we fly it in space,
p94
aVwe put it up in front of the star,
p95
aVwe block out most of the light,
p96
aVwe fly a space telescope in that shadow that's created,
p97
aVand boom, we get to see planets.
p98
aVWell that would look something like this.
p99
aVSo there's that big screen,
p100
aVand there's no planets,
p101
aVbecause unfortunately it doesn't actually work very well,
p102
aVbecause the light waves of the light and waves
p103
aVdiffracts around that screen
p104
aVthe same way it did in the telescope.
p105
aVIt's like water bending around a rock in a stream,
p106
aVand all that light just destroys the shadow.
p107
aVIt's a terrible shadow. And we can't see planets.
p108
aa(lp109
VBut Spitzer actually knew the answer.
p110
aVIf we can feather the edges, soften those edges
p111
aVso we can control diffraction,
p112
aVwell then we can see a planet,
p113
aVand in the last 10 years or so we've come up
p114
aVwith optimal solutions for doing that.
p115
aVIt looks something like that.
p116
aVWe call that our flower petal starshade.
p117
aVIf we make the edges of those petals exactly right,
p118
aVif we control their shape,
p119
aVwe can control diffraction,
p120
aVand now we have a great shadow.
p121
aVIt's about 10 billion times dimmer than it was before,
p122
aVand we can see the planets beam out just like that.
p123
aVThat, of course, has to be bigger than my thumb.
p124
aVThat starshade is about
p125
aVthe size of half a football field
p126
aVand it has to fly 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope
p127
aVthat has to be held right in its shadow,
p128
aVand then we can see those planets.
p129
aa(lp130
VThis sounds formidable,
p131
aVbut brilliant engineers, colleagues of mine at JPL,
p132
aVcame up with a fabulous design for how to do that
p133
aVand it looks like this.
p134
aVIt starts wrapped around a hub.
p135
aVIt separates from the telescope.
p136
aVThe petals unfurl, they open up,
p137
aVthe telescope turns around.
p138
aVThen you'll see it flip and fly out
p139
aVthat 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope.
p140
aVIt's going to move in front of the star
p141
aVjust like that, creates a wonderful shadow.
p142
aVBoom, we get planets orbiting about it.
p143
aV(Applause)
p144
aVThank you.
p145
aa(lp146
VThat's not science fiction.
p147
aVWe've been working on this for the last five or six years.
p148
aVLast summer, we did a really cool test
p149
aVout in California at Northrop Grumman.
p150
aVSo those are four petals.
p151
aVThis is a sub-scale star shade.
p152
aVIt's about half the size of the one you just saw.
p153
aVYou'll see the petals unfurl.
p154
aVThose four petals were built by four undergraduates
p155
aVdoing a summer internship at JPL.
p156
aVNow you're seeing it deploy.
p157
aVThose petals have to rotate into place.
p158
aVThe base of those petals
p159
aVhas to go to the same place every time
p160
aVto within a tenth of a millimeter.
p161
aVWe ran this test 16 times,
p162
aVand 16 times it went into the exact same place
p163
aVto a tenth of a millimeter.
p164
aVThis has to be done very precisely,
p165
aVbut if we can do this, if we can build this technology,
p166
aVif we can get it into space,
p167
aVyou might see something like this.
p168
aVThat's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars
p169
aVtaken with the Hubble Space Telescope.
p170
aVIf we can take a similar space telescope,
p171
aVslightly larger,
p172
aVput it out there,
p173
aVfly an occulter in front of it,
p174
aVwhat we might see is something like that \u2014
p175
aVthat's a family portrait of our solar system \u2014 but not ours.
p176
aVWe're hoping it'll be someone else's solar system
p177
aVas seen through an occulter,
p178
aVthrough a starshade like that.
p179
aVYou can see Jupiter, you can see Saturn,
p180
aVUranus, Neptune, and right there in the center,
p181
aVnext to the residual light
p182
aVis that pale blue dot. That's Earth.
p183
aVWe want to see that, see if there's water,
p184
aVoxygen, ozone,
p185
aVthe things that might tell us that it could harbor life.
p186
aa(lp187
VI think this is the coolest possible science.
p188
aVThat's why I got into doing this,
p189
aVbecause I think that will change the world.
p190
aVThat will change everything when we see that.
p191
aa(lp192
VThank you.
