VSo if I told you that this was the face of pure joy,
p4
aVwould you call me crazy?
p5
aVI wouldn't blame you,
p6
aVbecause every time I look at this Arctic selfie, I shiver just a little bit.
p7
aVI want to tell you a little bit about this photograph.
p8
aa(lp9
VI was swimming around in the Lofoten Islands in Norway,
p10
aVjust inside the Arctic Circle,
p11
aVand the water was hovering right at freezing.
p12
aVThe air? A brisk -10 with windchill,
p13
aVand I could literally feel the blood trying to leave my hands,
p14
aVfeet and face, and rush to protect my vital organs.
p15
aVIt was the coldest I've ever been.
p16
aVBut even with swollen lips, sunken eyes, and cheeks flushed red,
p17
aVI have found that this place right here is somewhere I can find great joy.
p18
aa(lp19
VNow, when it comes to pain, psychologist Brock Bastian
p20
aVprobably said it best when he wrote,
p21
aV"Pain is a kind of shortcut to mindfulness.
p22
aVIt makes us suddenly aware of everything in the environment.
p23
aVIt brutally draws us in
p24
aVto a virtual sensory awareness of the world much like meditation."
p25
aa(lp26
VIf shivering is a form of meditation, then I would consider myself a monk.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VNow, before we get into the why
p30
aVwould anyone ever want to surf in freezing cold water?
p31
aVI would love to give you a little perspective
p32
aVon what a day in my life can look like.

V(Video) Man: I mean, I know we were hoping for good waves,
p37
aVbut I don't think anybody thought that was going to happen.
p38
aVI can't stop shaking.
p39
aVI am so cold.

VChris Burkard: So, surf photographer, right?
p46
aVI don't even know if it's a real job title, to be honest.
p47
aVMy parents definitely didn't think so
p48
aVwhen I told them at 19 I was quitting my job to pursue this dream career:
p49
aVblue skies, warm tropical beaches, and a tan that lasts all year long.
p50
aVI mean, to me, this was it. Life could not get any better.
p51
aVSweating it out, shooting surfers in these exotic tourist destinations.
p52
aVBut there was just this one problem.
p53
aVYou see, the more time I spent traveling to these exotic locations,
p54
aVthe less gratifying it seemed to be.
p55
aVI set out seeking adventure, and what I was finding was only routine.
p56
aVIt was things like wi-fi, TV, fine dining, and a constant cellular connection
p57
aVthat to me were all the trappings of places heavily touristed
p58
aVin and out of the water,
p59
aVand it didn't take long for me to start feeling suffocated.
p60
aa(lp61
VI began craving wild, open spaces,
p62
aVand so I set out to find the places others had written off
p63
aVas too cold, too remote, and too dangerous to surf,
p64
aVand that challenge intrigued me.
p65
aVI began this sort of personal crusade against the mundane,
p66
aVbecause if there's one thing I've realized,
p67
aVit's that any career,
p68
aVeven one as seemingly glamorous as surf photography,
p69
aVhas the danger of becoming monotonous.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo in my search to break up this monotony, I realized something:
p72
aVThere's only about a third of the Earth's oceans that are warm,
p73
aVand it's really just that thin band around the equator.
p74
aVSo if I was going to find perfect waves,
p75
aVit was probably going to happen somewhere cold,
p76
aVwhere the seas are notoriously rough,
p77
aVand that's exactly where I began to look.
p78
aVAnd it was my first trip to Iceland
p79
aVthat I felt like I found exactly what I was looking for.
p80
aa(lp81
VI was blown away by the natural beauty of the landscape,
p82
aVbut most importantly, I couldn't believe we were finding perfect waves
p83
aVin such a remote and rugged part of the world.
p84
aVAt one point, we got to the beach
p85
aVonly to find massive chunks of ice had piled on the shoreline.
p86
aVThey created this barrier between us and the surf,
p87
aVand we had to weave  through this thing like a maze
p88
aVjust to get out into the lineup.
p89
aVand once we got there,
p90
aVwe were pushing aside these ice chunks trying to get into waves.
p91
aVIt was an incredible experience, one I'll never forget,
p92
aVbecause amidst those harsh conditions,
p93
aVI felt like I stumbled onto one of the last quiet places,
p94
aVsomewhere that I found a clarity and a connection with the world
p95
aVI knew I would never find on a crowded beach.
p96
aa(lp97
VI was hooked. I was hooked. (Laughter)
p98
aVCold water was constantly on my mind,
p99
aVand from that point on,
p100
aVmy career focused on these types of harsh and unforgiving environments,
p101
aVand it took me to places like Russia, Norway, Alaska, Iceland, Chile,
p102
aVthe Faroe Islands, and a lot of places in between.
p103
aVAnd one of my favorite things about these places
p104
aVwas simply the challenge and the creativity it took just to get there:
p105
aVhours, days, weeks spent on Google Earth
p106
aVtrying to pinpoint any remote stretch of beach or reef we could actually get to.
p107
aVAnd once we got there, the vehicles were just as creative:
p108
aVsnowmobiles, six-wheel Soviet troop carriers,
p109
aVand a couple of super-sketchy helicopter flights.
p110
aV(Laughter)
p111
aVHelicopters really scare me, by the way.
p112
aa(lp113
VThere was this one particularly bumpy boat ride
p114
aVup the coast of Vancouver Island to this kind of remote surf spot,
p115
aVwhere we ended up watching helplessly from the water
p116
aVas bears ravaged our camp site.
p117
aVThey walked off with our food and bits of our tent,
p118
aVclearly letting us know that we were at the bottom of the food chain
p119
aVand that this was their spot, not ours.
p120
aVBut to me, that trip
p121
aVwas a testament to the wildness I traded for those touristy beaches.
p122
aa(lp123
VNow, it wasn't until I traveled to Norway \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p124
aVthat I really learned to appreciate the cold.
p125
aVSo this is the place
p126
aVwhere some of the largest, the most violent storms in the world
p127
aVsend huge waves smashing into the coastline.
p128
aVWe were in this tiny, remote fjord, just inside the Arctic Circle.
p129
aVIt had a greater population of sheep than people,
p130
aVso help if we needed it was nowhere to be found.
p131
aVI was in the water  taking pictures of surfers,
p132
aVand it started to snow.
p133
aVAnd then the temperature began to drop.
p134
aVAnd I told myself, there's not a chance you're getting out of the water.
p135
aVYou traveled all this way, and this is exactly what you've been waiting for:
p136
aVfreezing cold conditions with perfect waves.
p137
aVAnd although I couldn't even feel my finger to push the trigger,
p138
aVI knew I wasn't getting out.
p139
aVSo I just did whatever I could. I shook it off, whatever.
p140
aVBut that was the point that I felt
p141
aVthis wind gush through the valley and hit me,
p142
aVand what started as this light snowfall quickly became a full-on blizzard,
p143
aVand I started to lose perception of where I was.
p144
aVI didn't know if I was drifting out to sea or towards shore,
p145
aVand all I could really make out was the faint sound of seagulls
p146
aVand crashing waves.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow, I knew this place had a reputation for sinking ships and grounding planes,
p149
aVand while I was out there floating, I started to get a little bit nervous.
p150
aVActually, I was totally freaking out \u2014
p151
aV(Laughter) \u2014 and I was borderline hypothermic,
p152
aVand my friends eventually had to help me out of the water.
p153
aVAnd I don't know if it was delirium setting in or what,
p154
aVbut they told me later
p155
aVI had a smile on my face the entire time.
p156
aa(lp157
VNow, it was this trip
p158
aVand probably that exact experience where I really began to feel
p159
aVlike every photograph was precious,
p160
aVbecause all of a sudden in that moment, it was something I was forced to earn.
p161
aVAnd I realized, all this shivering had actually taught me something:
p162
aVIn life, there are no shortcuts to joy.
p163
aVAnything that is worth pursuing is going to require us to suffer
p164
aVjust a little bit,
p165
aVand that tiny bit of suffering that I did for my photography,
p166
aVit added a value to my work that was so much more meaningful to me
p167
aVthan just trying to fill the pages of magazines.
p168
aVSee, I gave a piece of myself in these places,
p169
aVand what I walked away with
p170
aVwas a sense of fulfillment I had always been searching for.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo I look back at this photograph.
p173
aVIt's easy to see frozen fingers and cold wetsuits
p174
aVand even the struggle that it took just to get there,
p175
aVbut most of all, what I see is just joy.
p176
aa(lp177
VThank you so much.
