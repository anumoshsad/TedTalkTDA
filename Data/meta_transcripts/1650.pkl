VYou know, my favorite part of being a dad
p4
aVis the movies I get to watch.
p5
aVI love sharing my favorite movies with my kids,
p6
aVand when my daughter was four,
p7
aVwe got to watch "The Wizard of Oz" together.
p8
aVIt totally dominated her imagination for months.
p9
aVHer favorite character was Glinda, of course.
p10
aVIt gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress
p11
aVand carry a wand.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut you watch that movie enough times,
p14
aVand you start to realize how unusual it is.
p15
aVNow we live today, and are raising our children,
p16
aVin a kind of children's-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex.
p17
aVBut "The Wizard of Oz" stood alone.
p18
aVIt did not start that trend.
p19
aVForty years later was when the trend really caught on,
p20
aVwith, interestingly, another movie
p21
aVthat featured a metal guy
p22
aVand a furry guy
p23
aVrescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy's guards.
p24
aVDo you know what I'm talking about? (Laughter)
p25
aVYeah.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow, there's a big difference between these two movies,
p28
aVa couple of really big differences between "The Wizard of Oz"
p29
aVand all the movies we watch today.
p30
aVOne is there's very little violence in "The Wizard of Oz."
p31
aVThe monkeys are rather aggressive, as are the apple trees.
p32
aVBut I think if "The Wizard of Oz" were made today,
p33
aVthe wizard would say, "Dorothy, you are the savior of Oz
p34
aVthat the prophecy foretold.
p35
aVUse your magic slippers to defeat
p36
aVthe computer-generated armies of the Wicked Witch."
p37
aVBut that's not how it happens.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnother thing that's really unique about "The Wizard of Oz"
p40
aVto me is that all of the most heroic
p41
aVand wise and even villainous characters
p42
aVare female.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow I started to notice this
p45
aVwhen I actually showed "Star Wars" to my daughter,
p46
aVwhich was years later, and the situation was different.
p47
aVAt that point I also had a son.
p48
aVHe was only three at the time.
p49
aVHe was not invited to the screening. He was too young for that.
p50
aVBut he was the second child,
p51
aVand the level of supervision had plummeted. (Laughter)
p52
aVSo he wandered in,
p53
aVand it imprinted on him
p54
aVlike a mommy duck does to its duckling,
p55
aVand I don't think he understands what's going on,
p56
aVbut he is sure soaking in it.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd I wonder what he's soaking in.
p59
aVIs he picking up on the themes of courage
p60
aVand perseverance and loyalty?
p61
aVIs he picking up on the fact that Luke
p62
aVjoins an army to overthrow the government?
p63
aVIs he picking up on the fact that
p64
aVthere are only boys in the universe
p65
aVexcept for Aunt Beru, and of course this princess,
p66
aVwho's really cool, but who kind of waits around through most of the movie
p67
aVso that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink
p68
aVto thank him for saving the universe, which he does
p69
aVby the magic that he was born with?
p70
aa(lp71
VCompare this to 1939 with "The Wizard of Oz."
p72
aVHow does Dorothy win her movie?
p73
aVBy making friends with everybody
p74
aVand being a leader.
p75
aVThat's kind of the world I'd rather raise my kids in \u2014
p76
aVOz, right? \u2014 and not the world of dudes fighting,
p77
aVwhich is where we kind of have to be.
p78
aVWhy is there so much Force \u2014 capital F, Force \u2014
p79
aVin the movies we have for our kids,
p80
aVand so little yellow brick road?
p81
aa(lp82
VThere is a lot of great writing about the impact
p83
aVthat the boy-violent movie has on girls,
p84
aVand you should do that reading. It's very good.
p85
aVI haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe.
p86
aVI know from my own experience that
p87
aVPrincess Leia did not provide the adequate context
p88
aVthat I could have used in navigating the adult world
p89
aVthat is co-ed. (Laughter)
p90
aVI think there was a first-kiss moment
p91
aVwhen I really expected the credits to start rolling
p92
aVbecause that's the end of the movie, right?
p93
aVI finished my quest, I got the girl.
p94
aVWhy are you still standing there?
p95
aVI don't know what I'm supposed to do.
p96
aa(lp97
VThe movies are very, very focused on defeating the villain
p98
aVand getting your reward, and there's not a lot of room
p99
aVfor other relationships and other journeys.
p100
aVIt's almost as though if you're a boy,
p101
aVyou are a dopey animal,
p102
aVand if you are a girl, you should bring your warrior costume.
p103
aVThere are plenty of exceptions,
p104
aVand I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you.
p105
aVBut they do send a message to boys,
p106
aVthat they are not, the boys are not really the target audience.
p107
aVThey are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls
p108
aVhow to defend against the patriarchy,
p109
aVbut they are not necessarily showing boys
p110
aVhow they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy.
p111
aVThere's no models for them.
p112
aVAnd we also have some terrific women
p113
aVwho are writing new stories for our kids,
p114
aVand as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are,
p115
aVthese are still war movies.
p116
aVAnd, of course, the most successful studio of all time
p117
aVcontinues to crank out classic after classic,
p118
aVevery single one of them about
p119
aVthe journey of a boy, or a man,
p120
aVor two men who are friends, or a man and his son,
p121
aVor two men who are raising a little girl.
p122
aVUntil, as many of you are thinking, this year,
p123
aVwhen they finally came out with "Brave."
p124
aVI recommend it to all of you. It's on demand now.
p125
aVDo you remember what the critics said when "Brave" came out?
p126
aV"Aw, I can't believe Pixar made a princess movie."
p127
aVIt's very good. Don't let that stop you.
p128
aa(lp129
VNow, almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test.
p130
aVI don't know if you've heard of this.
p131
aVIt has not yet caught on and caught fire,
p132
aVbut maybe today we will start a movement.
p133
aVAlison Bechdel is a comic book artist,
p134
aVand back in the mid-'80s, she recorded this conversation
p135
aVshe'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw.
p136
aVAnd it's very simple. There's just three questions you should ask:
p137
aa(lp138
VIs there more than one character in the movie
p139
aVthat is female who has lines?
p140
aVSo try to meet that bar.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie?
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd is their conversation about something other than
p145
aVthe guy that they both like? (Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VRight? Thank you. (Applause)
p148
aVThank you very much.
p149
aa(lp150
VTwo women who exist and talk to each other about stuff.
p151
aVIt does happen. I've seen it,
p152
aVand yet I very rarely see it in the movies
p153
aVthat we know and love.
p154
aa(lp155
VIn fact, this week I went to see
p156
aVa very high-quality movie, "Argo."
p157
aVRight? Oscar buzz, doing great at the box office,
p158
aVa consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is.
p159
aVIt pretty much flunks the Bechdel test.
p160
aVAnd I don't think it should, because a lot of the movie,
p161
aVI don't know if you've seen it, but a lot of the movie
p162
aVtakes place in this embassy where men and women
p163
aVare hiding out during the hostage crisis.
p164
aVWe've got quite a few scenes of the men
p165
aVhaving deep, angst-ridden conversations in this hideout,
p166
aVand the great moment for one of the actresses is
p167
aVto peek through the door and say, "Are you coming to bed, honey?"
p168
aVThat's Hollywood for you.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo let's look at the numbers.
p171
aV2011, of the 100 most popular movies,
p172
aVhow many of them do you think actually have female protagonists?
p173
aVEleven. It's not bad.
p174
aVIt's not as many percent as the number of women
p175
aVwe've just elected to Congress, so that's good.
p176
aVBut there is a number that is greater than this
p177
aVthat's going to bring this room down.
p178
aa(lp179
VLast year, The New York Times published a study
p180
aVthat the government had done.
p181
aVHere's what it said.
p182
aVOne out of five women in America
p183
aVsay that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life.
p184
aa(lp185
VNow, I don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment.
p186
aVI don't think kids' movies have anything to do with that.
p187
aVI don't even think that
p188
aVmusic videos or pornography are really directly related to that,
p189
aVbut something is going wrong,
p190
aVand when I hear that statistic,
p191
aVone of the things I think of is
p192
aVthat's a lot of sexual assailants.
p193
aVWho are these guys? What are they learning?
p194
aVWhat are they failing to learn?
p195
aVAre they absorbing the story that
p196
aVa male hero's job is to defeat the villain with violence
p197
aVand then collect the reward, which is a woman
p198
aVwho has no friends and doesn't speak?
p199
aVAre we soaking up that story?
p200
aa(lp201
VYou know,
p202
aVas a parent with the privilege
p203
aVof raising a daughter
p204
aVlike all of you who are doing the same thing,
p205
aVwe find this world and this statistic very alarming
p206
aVand we want to prepare them.
p207
aVWe have tools at our disposal like "girl power,"
p208
aVand we hope that that will help,
p209
aVbut I gotta wonder, is girl power going to protect them
p210
aVif, at the same time, actively or passively,
p211
aVwe are training our sons to maintain their boy power?
p212
aVI mean, I think the Netflix queue
p213
aVis one way that we can do something very important,
p214
aVand I'm talking mainly to the dads here.
p215
aVI think we have got to show our sons
p216
aVa new definition of manhood.
p217
aa(lp218
VThe definition of manhood is already turning upside down.
p219
aVYou've read about how the new economy
p220
aVis changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner.
p221
aVThey're throwing it up in the air.
p222
aVSo our sons are going to have to find some way
p223
aVof adapting to this, some new relationship with each other,
p224
aVand I think we really have to show them, and model for them,
p225
aVhow a real man
p226
aVis someone who trusts his sisters
p227
aVand respects them, and wants to be on their team,
p228
aVand stands up against the real bad guys,
p229
aVwho are the men who want to abuse the women.
p230
aVAnd I think our job in the Netflix queue
p231
aVis to look out for those movies that pass the Bechdel Test,
p232
aVif we can find them, and to seek out the heroines
p233
aVwho are there,
p234
aVwho show real courage, who bring people together,
p235
aVand to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines
p236
aVand to say, "I want to be on their team,"
p237
aVbecause they're going to be on their team.
p238
aa(lp239
VWhen I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in "Star Wars,"
p240
aVdo you know what she said?
p241
aVObi-Wan.
p242
aVObi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda.
p243
aVWhat do these two have in common?
p244
aVMaybe it's not just the sparkly dress.
p245
aVI think these people are experts.
p246
aVI think these are the two people in the movie
p247
aVwho know more than anybody else,
p248
aVand they love sharing their knowledge with other people
p249
aVto help them reach their potential.
p250
aVNow, they are leaders.
p251
aVI like that kind of quest for my daughter,
p252
aVand I like that kind of quest for my son.
p253
aVI want more quests like that.
p254
aVI want fewer quests where my son is told,
p255
aV"Go out and fight it alone,"
p256
aVand more quests where he sees that it's his job to join a team,
p257
aVmaybe a team led by women,
p258
aVto help other people become better
p259
aVand be better people,
p260
aVlike the Wizard of Oz.
p261
aVThank you.
