VIn System D, this
p4
aVis a store,
p5
aVand what I mean by that is that this is a photograph
p6
aVI took in Makoko, shantytown in Lagos, Nigeria.
p7
aVIt's built over the lagoon, and there are no streets
p8
aVwhere there can be stores to shop,
p9
aVand so the store comes to you.
p10
aa(lp11
VAnd in the same community,
p12
aVthis is business synergy.
p13
aVThis is the boat that that lady was paddling around in,
p14
aVand this artisan makes the boat and the paddles
p15
aVand sells directly
p16
aVto the people who need the boat and the paddles.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd this is a global business.
p19
aVOgandiro smokes fish in Makoko in Lagos,
p20
aVand I asked her, "Where does the fish come from?"
p21
aVAnd I thought she'd say, "Oh, you know,
p22
aVup the lagoon somewhere, or maybe across Africa,"
p23
aVbut you'll be happy to know she said
p24
aVit came from here, it comes from the North Sea.
p25
aVIt's caught here, frozen, shipped down to Lagos,
p26
aVsmoked, and sold for a tiny increment of profit
p27
aVon the streets of Lagos.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd this is a business incubator.
p30
aVThis is Olusosun dump, the largest garbage dump in Lagos,
p31
aVand 2,000 people work here, and I found this out
p32
aVfrom this fellow, Andrew Saboru.
p33
aVAndrew spent 16 years scavenging materials on the dump,
p34
aVearned enough money to turn himself into a contract scaler,
p35
aVwhich meant he carried a scale and went around and
p36
aVweighed all the materials that people had scavenged
p37
aVfrom the dump. Now he's a scrap dealer.
p38
aVThat's his little depot behind him,
p39
aVand he earns twice the Nigerian minimum wage.
p40
aa(lp41
VThis is a shopping mall.
p42
aVThis is Oshodi Market in Lagos.
p43
aVJorge Luis Borges had a story called "The Aleph,"
p44
aVand the Aleph is a point in the world
p45
aVwhere absolutely everything exists,
p46
aVand for me, this image is a point in the world
p47
aVwhere absolutely everything exists.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo, what am I talking about when I talk about System D?
p50
aVIt's traditionally called the informal economy,
p51
aVthe underground economy, the black market.
p52
aVI don't conceive of it that way.
p53
aVI think it's really important to understand that something like
p54
aVthis is totally open. It's right there for you to find.
p55
aVAll of this is happening openly, and aboveboard.
p56
aVThere's nothing underground about it.
p57
aVIt's our prejudgment that it's underground.
p58
aa(lp59
VI've pirated the term System D from the former French colonies.
p60
aVThere's a word in French that is débrouillardise,
p61
aVthat means to be self-reliant,
p62
aVand the former French colonies have turned that into
p63
aVSystem D for the economy of self-reliance,
p64
aVor the DIY economy.
p65
aa(lp66
VBut governments hate the DIY economy,
p67
aVand that's why \u2014 I took this picture in 2007,
p68
aVand this is the same market in 2009 \u2014
p69
aVand I think, when the organizers of this conference
p70
aVwere talking about radical openness,
p71
aVthey didn't mean that the streets should be open
p72
aVand the people should be gone.
p73
aa(lp74
VI think what we have is a pickle problem.
p75
aVI had a friend who worked at a pickle factory,
p76
aVand the cucumbers would come flying down
p77
aVthis conveyer belt, and his job was to pick off the ones
p78
aVthat didn't look so good and throw them in the bin
p79
aVlabeled "relish" where they'd be crushed and mixed
p80
aVwith vinegar and used for other kinds of profit.
p81
aVThis is the pickle economy.
p82
aVWe're all focusing on \u2014 this is a statistic from
p83
aVearlier this month in the Financial Times \u2014
p84
aVwe're all focusing on the luxury economy.
p85
aVIt's worth 1.5 trillion dollars every year, and that's
p86
aVa vast amount of money, right?
p87
aVThat's three times the Gross Domestic Product of Switzerland.
p88
aVSo it's vast. But it should come with an asterisk,
p89
aVand the asterisk is that it excludes two thirds of the workers
p90
aVof the world.
p91
aV1.8 billion people around the world work
p92
aVin the economy that is unregulated and informal.
p93
aVThat's a huge number, and what does that mean?
p94
aVWell, it means if it were united in a single political system,
p95
aVone country, call it
p96
aV"The United Street Sellers Republic," the U.S.S.R.,
p97
aVor "Bazaaristan,"
p98
aVit would be worth 10 trillion dollars every year,
p99
aVand that would make it the second largest economy
p100
aVin the world, after the United States.
p101
aVAnd given that projections are that the bulk
p102
aVof economic growth over the next 15 years will come
p103
aVfrom emerging economies in the developing world,
p104
aVit could easily overtake the United States
p105
aVand become the largest economy in the world.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo the implications of that are vast, because it means
p108
aVthat this is where employment is \u2014 1.8 billion people \u2014
p109
aVand this is where we can create a more egalitarian world,
p110
aVbecause people are actually able to earn money and live
p111
aVand thrive, as Andrew Saboru did.
p112
aa(lp113
VBig businesses have recognized this,
p114
aVand what's fascinating about this slide,
p115
aVit's not that the guys can carry boxes on their heads
p116
aVand run around without dropping them off.
p117
aVit's that the Gala sausage roll is a product that's made
p118
aVby a global company called UAC foods
p119
aVthat's active throughout Africa and the Middle East,
p120
aVbut the Gala sausage roll is not sold in stores.
p121
aVUAC foods has recognized that it won't sell if it's in stores.
p122
aVIt's only sold by a phalanx of street hawkers
p123
aVwho run around the streets of Lagos at bus stations
p124
aVand in traffic jams and sell it as a snack,
p125
aVand it's been sold that way for 40 years.
p126
aVIt's a business plan for a corporation.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd it's not just in Africa.
p129
aVHere's Mr. Clean looking amorously at all the other
p130
aVProcter & Gamble products,
p131
aVand Procter & Gamble, you know,
p132
aVthe statistic always cited is that Wal-Mart
p133
aVis their largest customer, and it's true, as one store,
p134
aVWal-Mart buys 15 percent, thus 15 percent
p135
aVof Procter & Gamble's business is with Wal-Mart,
p136
aVbut their largest market segment is something that they call
p137
aV"high frequency stores," which is all these tiny kiosks
p138
aVand the lady in the canoe and all these other businesses
p139
aVthat exist in System D, the informal economy,
p140
aVand Procter & Gamble makes 20 percent of its money
p141
aVfrom that market segment,
p142
aVand it's the only market segment that's growing.
p143
aVSo Procter & Gamble says, "We don't care whether a store
p144
aVis incorporated or registered or anything like that.
p145
aVWe want our products in that store."
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd then there's mobile phones.
p148
aVThis is an ad for MTN,
p149
aVwhich is a South African multinational
p150
aVactive in about 25 countries,
p151
aVand when they came into Nigeria \u2014
p152
aVNigeria is the big dog in Africa.
p153
aVOne in seven Africans is a Nigerian,
p154
aVand so everyone wants in to the mobile phone market
p155
aVin Nigeria. And when MTN came in, they wanted
p156
aVto sell the mobile service like I get in the United States
p157
aVor like people get here in the U.K. or in Europe \u2014
p158
aVexpensive monthly plans, you get a phone,
p159
aVyou pay overages,
p160
aVyou're killed with fees \u2014
p161
aVand their plan crashed and burned.
p162
aVAnd they went back to the drawing board, and they retooled,
p163
aVand they came up with another plan:
p164
aVWe don't sell you the phone,
p165
aVwe don't sell you the monthly plan.
p166
aVWe only sell you airtime.
p167
aVAnd where's the airtime sold?
p168
aVIt's sold at umbrella stands all over the streets,
p169
aVwhere people are unregistered, unlicensed,
p170
aVbut MTN makes most of its profits,
p171
aVperhaps 90 percent of its profits,
p172
aVfrom selling through System D, the informal economy.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd where do the phones come from?
p175
aVWell, they come from here. This is in Guangzhou, China,
p176
aVand if you go upstairs in this rather sleepy looking
p177
aVelectronics mall, you find the Guangzhou Dashatou
p178
aVsecond-hand trade center,
p179
aVand if you go in there, you follow the guys with the muscles
p180
aVwho are carrying the boxes, and where are they going?
p181
aVThey're going to Eddy in Lagos.
p182
aVNow, most of the phones there are not second-hand at all.
p183
aVThe name is a misnomer.
p184
aVMost of them are pirated. They have the name brand
p185
aVon them, but they're not manufactured by the name brand.
p186
aa(lp187
VNow, are there downsides to that?
p188
aVWell, I guess. You know, China has no \u2014
p189
aV(Laughter) \u2014 no intellectual property, right?
p190
aVVersace without the vowels.
p191
aVZhuomani instead of Armani.
p192
aVS. Guuuci, and \u2014 (Laughter) (Applause)
p193
aVAll around the world this is how products
p194
aVare being distributed, so, for instance,
p195
aVin one street market on Rua 25 de Março
p196
aVin São Paulo, Brazil,
p197
aVyou can buy fake designer glasses.
p198
aVYou can buy cloned cologne.
p199
aVYou can buy pirated DVDs, of course.
p200
aVYou can buy New York Yankees caps
p201
aVin all sorts of unauthorized patterns.
p202
aVYou can buy cuecas baratas, designer underwear
p203
aVthat isn't really manufactured by a designer,
p204
aVand even pirated evangelical mixtapes. (Laughter)
p205
aa(lp206
VNow, businesses tend to complain about this,
p207
aVand their, they, I don't want to take away from their
p208
aVentire validity of complaining about it,
p209
aVbut I did ask a major sneaker manufacturer earlier this year
p210
aVwhat they thought about piracy,
p211
aVand they told me, "Well, you can't quote me on this,
p212
aVbecause if you quote me on this, I have to kill you,"
p213
aVbut they use piracy as market research.
p214
aVThe sneaker manufacturer told me that if
p215
aVthey find that Pumas are being pirated, or Adidas
p216
aVare being pirated and their sneakers aren't being pirated,
p217
aVthey know they've done something wrong. (Laughter)
p218
aVSo it's very important to them to track piracy
p219
aVexactly because of this, and the people who are buying,
p220
aVthe pirates, are not their customers anyway,
p221
aVbecause their customers want the real deal.
p222
aa(lp223
VNow, there's another problem.
p224
aVThis is a real street sign in Lagos, Nigeria.
p225
aVAll of System D really doesn't pay taxes, right?
p226
aVAnd when I think about that, first of all I think that
p227
aVgovernment is a social contract between the people and
p228
aVthe government, and if the government isn't transparent,
p229
aVthen the people aren't going to be transparent either,
p230
aVbut also that we're blaming the little guy
p231
aVwho doesn't pay his taxes, and we're not recognizing
p232
aVthat everyone's fudging things all over the world,
p233
aVincluding some extremely respected businesses,
p234
aVand I'll give you one example.
p235
aVThere was one company that paid 4,000 bribes
p236
aVin the first decade of this millennium, and
p237
aVa million dollars in bribes every business day, right?
p238
aVAll over the world. And that company
p239
aVwas the big German electronics giant Siemens.
p240
aVSo this goes on in the formal economy
p241
aVas well as the informal economy,
p242
aVso it's wrong of us to blame \u2014 and I'm not singling out
p243
aVSiemens, I'm saying everyone does it. Okay?
p244
aa(lp245
VI just want to end by saying that if Adam Smith
p246
aVhad framed out a theory of the flea market
p247
aVinstead of the free market, what would be some
p248
aVof the principles?
p249
aa(lp250
VFirst, it would be to understand that it could be
p251
aVconsidered a cooperative, and this is a thought
p252
aVfrom the Brazilian legal scholar Roberto Mangabeira Unger.
p253
aVCooperative development is a way forward.
p254
aa(lp255
VSecondly, from the [Austrian] anarchist philosopher Paul Feyerabend,
p256
aVfacts are relative, and what is a massive right
p257
aVof self-reliance to a Nigerian businessperson
p258
aVis considered unauthorized and horrible to other people,
p259
aVand we have to recognize that there are differences
p260
aVin how people define things and what their facts are.
p261
aa(lp262
VAnd third is, and I'm taking this from
p263
aVthe great American beat poet Allen Ginsberg,
p264
aVthat alternate economies barter and
p265
aVdifferent kinds of currency, alternate currencies
p266
aVare also very important, and he talked about
p267
aVbuying what he needed just with his good looks.
p268
aa(lp269
VAnd so I just want to leave you there, and say that
p270
aVthis economy is a tremendous force for global development
p271
aVand we need to think about it that way.
p272
aVThank you very much. (Applause)
