VI thought I'd begin with a scene of war.
p4
aVThere was little to warn of the danger ahead.
p5
aVThe Iraqi insurgent had placed the IED,
p6
aVan Improvised Explosive Device,
p7
aValong the side of the road with great care.
p8
aVBy 2006, there were more than 2,500
p9
aVof these attacks every single month,
p10
aVand they were the leading cause of
p11
aVcasualties among American soldiers
p12
aVand Iraqi civilians.
p13
aVThe team that was hunting for this IED
p14
aVis called an EOD team\u2014
p15
aVExplosives Ordinance Disposal\u2014and
p16
aVthey're the pointy end of the spear in the
p17
aVAmerican effort to suppress these roadside bombs.
p18
aVEach EOD team goes out on about
p19
aV600 of these bomb calls every year,
p20
aVdefusing about two bombs a day.
p21
aVPerhaps the best sign of how valuable they
p22
aVare to the war effort, is that
p23
aVthe Iraqi insurgents put a $50,000 bounty
p24
aVon the head of a single EOD soldier.
p25
aa(lp26
VUnfortunately, this particular call
p27
aVwould not end well.
p28
aVBy the time the soldier advanced close
p29
aVenough to see the telltale wires
p30
aVof the bomb, it exploded in a wave of flame.
p31
aVNow, depending how close you are
p32
aVand how much explosive has been packed
p33
aVinto that bomb, it can cause death
p34
aVor injury. You have to be as far as
p35
aV50 yards away to escape that.
p36
aVThe blast is so strong it can even break
p37
aVyour limbs, even if you're not hit.
p38
aVThat soldier had been on top of the bomb.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd so when the rest of the team advanced
p41
aVthey found little left. And that night the unit's
p42
aVcommander did a sad duty, and he wrote
p43
aVa condolence letter back to the United
p44
aVStates, and he talked about how hard the
p45
aVloss had been on his unit, about the fact
p46
aVthat they had lost their bravest soldier,
p47
aVa soldier who had saved their lives
p48
aVmany a time.
p49
aVAnd he apologized
p50
aVfor not being able to bring them home.
p51
aVBut then he talked up the silver lining
p52
aVthat he took away from the loss.
p53
aV"At least," as he wrote, "when a robot dies,
p54
aVyou don't have to write a letter
p55
aVto its mother."
p56
aa(lp57
VThat scene sounds like science fiction,
p58
aVbut is battlefield reality already.
p59
aVThe soldier in that case
p60
aVwas a 42-pound robot called a PackBot.
p61
aVThe chief's letter went, not to some
p62
aVfarmhouse in Iowa like you see
p63
aVin the old war movies, but went to
p64
aVthe iRobot Company, which is
p65
aVnamed after the Asimov novel
p66
aVand the not-so-great Will Smith movie,
p67
aVand... um... (Laughter)...
p68
aVif you remember that
p69
aVin that fictional world, robots started out
p70
aVcarrying out mundane chores, and then
p71
aVthey started taking on life-and-death decisions.
p72
aVThat's a reality we face today.
p73
aa(lp74
VWhat we're going to do is actually just
p75
aVflash a series of photos behind me that
p76
aVshow you the reality of robots used in war
p77
aVright now or already at the prototype stage.
p78
aVIt's just to give you a taste.
p79
aVAnother way of putting it is you're not
p80
aVgoing to see anything that's powered
p81
aVby Vulcan technology, or teenage
p82
aVwizard hormones or anything like that.
p83
aVThis is all real. So why don't we
p84
aVgo ahead and start those pictures.
p85
aa(lp86
VSomething big is going on in war today,
p87
aVand maybe even the history of humanity
p88
aVitself. The U.S. military went into Iraq with
p89
aVa handful of drones in the air.
p90
aVWe now have 5,300.
p91
aVWe went in with zero unmanned ground
p92
aVsystems. We now have 12,000.
p93
aVAnd the tech term "killer application"
p94
aVtakes on new meaning in this space.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd we need to remember that we're
p97
aVtalking about the Model T Fords,
p98
aVthe Wright Flyers, compared
p99
aVto what's coming soon.
p100
aVThat's where we're at right now.
p101
aVOne of the people that I recently met with
p102
aVwas an Air Force three-star general, and he
p103
aVsaid basically, where we're headed very
p104
aVsoon is tens of thousands of robots
p105
aVoperating in our conflicts, and these
p106
aVnumbers matter, because we're not just
p107
aVtalking about tens of thousands of today's
p108
aVrobots, but tens of thousands of these
p109
aVprototypes and tomorrow's robots, because
p110
aVof course, one of the things that's operating
p111
aVin technology is Moore's Law,
p112
aVthat you can pack in more and more
p113
aVcomputing power into those robots, and so
p114
aVflash forward around 25 years,
p115
aVif Moore's Law holds true,
p116
aVthose robots will be close to a billion times
p117
aVmore powerful in their computing than today.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd so what that means is the kind of
p120
aVthings that we used to only talk about at
p121
aVscience fiction conventions like Comic-Con
p122
aVhave to be talked about in the halls
p123
aVof power and places like the Pentagon.
p124
aVA robots revolution is upon us.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow, I need to be clear here.
p127
aVI'm not talking about a revolution where you
p128
aVhave to worry about the Governor of
p129
aVCalifornia showing up at your door,
p130
aVa la the Terminator. (Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VWhen historians look at this period, they're
p133
aVgoing to conclude that we're in a different
p134
aVtype of revolution: a revolution in war,
p135
aVlike the invention of the atomic bomb.
p136
aVBut it may be even bigger than that,
p137
aVbecause our unmanned systems don't just
p138
aa(lp139
Vaffect the "how" of war-fighting,
p140
aVthey affect the "who" of fighting
p141
aVat its most fundamental level.
p142
aVThat is, every previous revolution in war, be
p143
aVit the machine gun, be it the atomic bomb,
p144
aVwas about a system that either shot faster,
p145
aVwent further, had a bigger boom.
p146
aVThat's certainly the case with robotics, but
p147
aVthey also change the experience of the warrior
p148
aVand even the very identity of the warrior.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnother way of putting this is that
p151
aVmankind's 5,000-year-old monopoly
p152
aVon the fighting of war is breaking down
p153
aVin our very lifetime. I've spent
p154
aVthe last several years going around
p155
aVmeeting with all the players in this field,
p156
aVfrom the robot scientists to the science
p157
aVfiction authors who inspired them to the
p158
aV19-year-old drone pilots who are fighting
p159
aVfrom Nevada, to the four-star generals
p160
aVwho command them, to even the Iraqi
p161
aVinsurgents who they are targeting and what
p162
aVthey think about our systems, and
p163
aVwhat I found interesting is not just
p164
aVtheir stories, but how their experiences
p165
aVpoint to these ripple effects that are going
p166
aVoutwards in our society, in our law
p167
aVand our ethics, etc. And so what I'd like
p168
aVto do with my remaining time is basically
p169
aVflesh out a couple of these.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo the first is that the future of war,
p172
aVeven a robotics one, is not going to be
p173
aVpurely an American one.
p174
aVThe U.S. is currently ahead in military
p175
aVrobotics right now, but we know that in
p176
aVtechnology there's no such thing as
p177
aVa permanent first move or advantage.
p178
aVIn a quick show of hands, how many
p179
aVpeople in this room still use
p180
aVWang Computers? (Laughter)
p181
aVIt's the same thing in war. The British and
p182
aVthe French invented the tank.
p183
aVThe Germans figured out how
p184
aVto use it right, and so what we have to
p185
aVthink about for the U.S. is that we are
p186
aVahead right now, but you have
p187
aV43 other countries out there
p188
aVworking on military robotics, and they
p189
aVinclude all the interesting countries like
p190
aVRussia, China, Pakistan, Iran.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd this raises a bigger worry for me.
p193
aVHow do we move forward in this revolution
p194
aVgiven the state of our manufacturing
p195
aVand the state of our science and
p196
aVmathematics training in our schools?
p197
aVOr another way of thinking about this is,
p198
aVwhat does it mean to go to war increasingly
p199
aVwith soldiers whose hardware is made
p200
aVin China and software is written in India?
p201
aa(lp202
VBut just as software has gone open-source,
p203
aVso has warfare.
p204
aVUnlike an aircraft carrier or an atomic bomb,
p205
aVyou don't need a massive manufacturing
p206
aVsystem to build robotics. A lot of it is
p207
aVoff the shelf. A lot of it's even do-it-yourself.
p208
aVOne of those things you just saw flashed
p209
aVbefore you was a raven drone, the handheld
p210
aVtossed one. For about a thousand dollars,
p211
aVyou can build one yourself, equivalent to
p212
aVwhat the soldiers use in Iraq.
p213
aa(lp214
VThat raises another wrinkle when it comes
p215
aVto war and conflict. Good guys might play
p216
aVaround and work on these as hobby kits,
p217
aVbut so might bad guys.
p218
aVThis cross between robotics and things like
p219
aVterrorism is going to be fascinating
p220
aVand even disturbing,
p221
aVand we've already seen it start.
p222
aa(lp223
VDuring the war between Israel, a state,
p224
aVand Hezbollah, a non-state actor,
p225
aVthe non-state actor flew
p226
aVfour different drones against Israel.
p227
aVThere's already a jihadi website
p228
aVthat you can go on and remotely
p229
aVdetonate an IED in Iraq while sitting
p230
aVat your home computer.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd so I think what we're going to see is
p233
aVtwo trends take place with this.
p234
aVFirst is, you're going to reinforce the power
p235
aVof individuals against governments,
p236
aVbut then the second is that
p237
aVwe are going to see an expansion
p238
aVin the realm of terrorism.
p239
aVThe future of it may be a cross between
p240
aVal Qaeda 2.0 and the
p241
aVnext generation of the Unabomber.
p242
aVAnd another way of thinking about this
p243
aVis the fact that, remember, you don't have
p244
aVto convince a robot that they're gonna
p245
aVreceive 72 virgins after they die
p246
aVto convince them to blow themselves up.
p247
aa(lp248
VBut the ripple effects of this are going to go
p249
aVout into our politics. One of the people that
p250
aVI met with was a former Assistant Secretary of
p251
aVDefense for Ronald Reagan, and he put it
p252
aVthis way: "I like these systems because
p253
aVthey save American lives, but I worry about
p254
aVmore marketization of wars,
p255
aVmore shock-and-awe talk,
p256
aVto defray discussion of the costs.
p257
aVPeople are more likely to support the use
p258
aVof force if they view it as costless."
p259
aa(lp260
VRobots for me take certain trends
p261
aVthat are already in play in our body politic,
p262
aVand maybe take them to
p263
aVtheir logical ending point.
p264
aVWe don't have a draft. We don't
p265
aVhave declarations of war anymore.
p266
aVWe don't buy war bonds anymore.
p267
aVAnd now we have the fact that we're
p268
aVconverting more and more of our American
p269
aVsoldiers that we would send into harm's
p270
aVway into machines, and so we may take
p271
aVthose already lowering bars to war
p272
aVand drop them to the ground.
p273
aa(lp274
VBut the future of war is also going to be
p275
aVa YouTube war.
p276
aVThat is, our new technologies don't merely
p277
aVremove humans from risk.
p278
aVThey also record everything that they see.
p279
aVSo they don't just delink the public:
p280
aVthey reshape its relationship with war.
p281
aVThere's already several thousand
p282
aVvideo clips of combat footage from Iraq
p283
aVon YouTube right now,
p284
aVmost of it gathered by drones.
p285
aa(lp286
VNow, this could be a good thing.
p287
aVIt could be building connections between
p288
aVthe home front and the war front
p289
aVas never before.
p290
aVBut remember, this is taking place
p291
aVin our strange, weird world, and so
p292
aVinevitably the ability to download these
p293
aVvideo clips to, you know, your iPod
p294
aVor your Zune gives you
p295
aVthe ability to turn it into entertainment.
p296
aa(lp297
VSoldiers have a name for these clips.
p298
aVThey call it war porn.
p299
aVThe typical one that I was sent was
p300
aVan email that had an attachment of
p301
aVvideo of a Predator strike taking out
p302
aVan enemy site. Missile hits,
p303
aVbodies burst into the air with the explosion.
p304
aVIt was set to music.
p305
aVIt was set to the pop song
p306
aV"I Just Want To Fly" by Sugar Ray.
p307
aa(lp308
VThis ability to watch more
p309
aVbut experience less creates a wrinkle
p310
aVin the public's relationship with war.
p311
aVI think about this with a sports parallel.
p312
aVIt's like the difference between
p313
aVwatching an NBA game, a professional
p314
aVbasketball game on TV, where the athletes
p315
aVare tiny figures on the screen, and
p316
aVbeing at that basketball game in person
p317
aVand realizing what someone seven feet
p318
aVreally does look like.
p319
aa(lp320
VBut we have to remember,
p321
aVthese are just the clips.
p322
aVThese are just the ESPN SportsCenter
p323
aVversion of the game. They lose the context.
p324
aVThey lose the strategy.
p325
aVThey lose the humanity. War just
p326
aVbecomes slam dunks and smart bombs.
p327
aa(lp328
VNow the irony of all this is that
p329
aVwhile the future of war may involve
p330
aVmore and more machines,
p331
aVit's our human psychology that's driving
p332
aVall of this, it's our human failings
p333
aVthat are leading to these wars.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo one example of this that has
p336
aVbig resonance in the policy realm is
p337
aVhow this plays out on our very real
p338
aVwar of ideas that we're fighting
p339
aVagainst radical groups.
p340
aVWhat is the message that we think we are
p341
aVsending with these machines versus what
p342
aVis being received in terms of the message.
p343
aa(lp344
VSo one of the people that I met was
p345
aVa senior Bush Administration official,
p346
aVwho had this to say about
p347
aVour unmanning of war:
p348
aV"It plays to our strength. The thing that
p349
aVscares people is our technology."
p350
aVBut when you go out and meet with people,
p351
aVfor example in Lebanon, it's a very
p352
aVdifferent story. One of the people
p353
aVI met with there was a news editor, and
p354
aVwe're talking as a drone is flying above him,
p355
aVand this is what he had to say.
p356
aV"This is just another sign of the coldhearted
p357
aVcruel Israelis and Americans,
p358
aVwho are cowards because
p359
aVthey send out machines to fight us.
p360
aVThey don't want to fight us like real men,
p361
aVbut they're afraid to fight,
p362
aVso we just have to kill a few of their soldiers
p363
aVto defeat them."
p364
aa(lp365
VThe future of war also is featuring
p366
aVa new type of warrior,
p367
aVand it's actually redefining the experience
p368
aVof going to war.
p369
aVYou can call this a cubicle warrior.
p370
aVThis is what one Predator drone pilot
p371
aVdescribed of his experience fighting
p372
aVin the Iraq War while never leaving Nevada.
p373
aV"You're going to war for 12 hours,
p374
aVshooting weapons at targets,
p375
aVdirecting kills on enemy combatants,
p376
aVand then you get in the car
p377
aVand you drive home and within 20 minutes,
p378
aVyou're sitting at the dinner table
p379
aVtalking to your kids about their homework."
p380
aa(lp381
VNow, the psychological balancing
p382
aVof those experiences is incredibly tough,
p383
aVand in fact those drone pilots have
p384
aVhigher rates of PTSD than many
p385
aVof the units physically in Iraq.
p386
aVBut some have worries that this
p387
aVdisconnection will lead to something else,
p388
aVthat it might make the contemplation of war
p389
aVcrimes a lot easier when you have
p390
aVthis distance. "It's like a video game,"
p391
aVis what one young pilot described to me
p392
aVof taking out enemy troops from afar.
p393
aVAs anyone who's played Grand Theft Auto
p394
aVknows, we do things in the video world
p395
aVthat we wouldn't do face to face.
p396
aa(lp397
VSo much of what you're hearing from me
p398
aVis that there's another side
p399
aVto technologic revolutions,
p400
aVand that it's shaping our present
p401
aVand maybe will shape our future of war.
p402
aVMoore's Law is operative,
p403
aVbut so's Murphy's Law.
p404
aVThe fog of war isn't being lifted.
p405
aVThe enemy has a vote.
p406
aa(lp407
VWe're gaining incredible new capabilities,
p408
aVbut we're also seeing and experiencing
p409
aVnew human dilemmas. Now,
p410
aVsometimes these are just "oops" moments,
p411
aVwhich is what the head of a robotics
p412
aVcompany described it, you just have
p413
aV"oops" moments. Well, what are
p414
aV"oops" moments with robots in war?
p415
aVWell, sometimes they're funny. Sometimes,
p416
aVthey're like that scene from the
p417
aVEddie Murphy movie "Best Defense,"
p418
aVplaying out in reality, where they tested out
p419
aVa machine gun-armed robot, and during
p420
aVthe demonstration it started spinning
p421
aVin a circle and pointed its machine gun
p422
aVat the reviewing stand of VIPs.
p423
aVFortunately the weapon wasn't loaded
p424
aVand no one was hurt, but other times
p425
aV"oops" moments are tragic,
p426
aVsuch as last year in South Africa, where
p427
aVan anti-aircraft cannon had a
p428
aV"software glitch," and actually did turn on
p429
aVand fired, and nine soldiers were killed.
p430
aa(lp431
VWe have new wrinkles in the laws of war
p432
aVand accountability. What do we do
p433
aVwith things like unmanned slaughter?
p434
aVWhat is unmanned slaughter?
p435
aVWe've already had three instances of
p436
aVPredator drone strikes where we thought
p437
aVwe got bin Laden, and it turned out
p438
aVnot to be the case.
p439
aVAnd this is where we're at right now.
p440
aVThis is not even talking about armed,
p441
aVautonomous systems
p442
aVwith full authority to use force.
p443
aVAnd do not believe that that isn't coming.
p444
aVDuring my research I came across
p445
aVfour different Pentagon projects
p446
aVon different aspects of that.
p447
aa(lp448
VAnd so you have this question:
p449
aVwhat does this lead to issues like
p450
aVwar crimes? Robots are emotionless, so
p451
aVthey don't get upset if their buddy is killed.
p452
aVThey don't commit crimes of rage
p453
aVand revenge.
p454
aVBut robots are emotionless.
p455
aVThey see an 80-year-old grandmother
p456
aVin a wheelchair the same way they see
p457
aVa T-80 tank: they're both
p458
aVjust a series of zeroes and ones.
p459
aVAnd so we have this question to figure out:
p460
aVHow do we catch up our 20th century
p461
aVlaws of war, that are so old right now
p462
aVthat they could qualify for Medicare,
p463
aVto these 21st century technologies?
p464
aa(lp465
VAnd so, in conclusion, I've talked about
p466
aVwhat seems the future of war,
p467
aVbut notice that I've only used
p468
aVreal world examples and you've only seen
p469
aVreal world pictures and videos.
p470
aVAnd so this sets a great challenge for
p471
aVall of us that we have to worry about well
p472
aVbefore you have to worry about your
p473
aVRoomba sucking the life away from you.
p474
aVAre we going to let the fact that what's
p475
aVunveiling itself right now in war
p476
aVsounds like science fiction and therefore
p477
aVkeeps us in denial?
p478
aVAre we going to face the reality
p479
aVof 21st century war?
p480
aVIs our generation going to make the same
p481
aVmistake that a past generation did
p482
aVwith atomic weaponry, and not deal with
p483
aVthe issues that surround it until
p484
aVPandora's box is already opened up?

VNow, I could be wrong on this, and
p487
aVone Pentagon robot scientist told me
p488
aVthat I was. He said, "There's no real
p489
aVsocial, ethical, moral issues when it comes
p490
aVto robots.
p491
aVThat is," he added, "unless the machine
p492
aVkills the wrong people repeatedly.
p493
aVThen it's just a product recall issue."
p494
aa(lp495
VAnd so the ending point for this is
p496
aVthat actually, we can turn to Hollywood.
p497
aVA few years ago, Hollywood gathered
p498
aVall the top characters and created
p499
aVa list of the top 100 heroes and
p500
aVtop 100 villains of all of Hollywood history,
p501
aVthe characters that represented the best
p502
aVand worst of humanity.
p503
aVOnly one character made it onto both lists:
p504
aVThe Terminator, a robot killing machine.
p505
aVAnd so that points to the fact that
p506
aVour machines can be used
p507
aVfor both good and evil, but for me
p508
aVit points to the fact that there's a duality
p509
aVof humans as well.

VThis week is a celebration
p512
aVof our creativity. Our creativity
p513
aVhas taken our species to the stars.
p514
aVOur creativity has created works of arts
p515
aVand literature to express our love.
p516
aVAnd now, we're using our creativity
p517
aVin a certain direction, to build fantastic
p518
aVmachines with incredible capabilities,
p519
aVmaybe even one day
p520
aVan entirely new species.
p521
aVBut one of the main reasons that we're
p522
aVdoing that is because of our drive
p523
aVto destroy each other, and so the question
p524
aVwe all should ask:
p525
aVis it our machines, or is it us
p526
aVthat's wired for war?
