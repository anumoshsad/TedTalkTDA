(lp3
VWe most certainly do talk to terrorists, no question about it.
p4
aVWe are at war with a new form of terrorism.
p5
aVIt's sort of the good old, traditional form of terrorism,
p6
aVbut it's sort of been packaged for the 21st century.
p7
aVOne of the big things about countering terrorism
p8
aVis, how do you perceive it?
p9
aVBecause perception leads to your response to it.
p10
aVSo if you have a traditional perception of terrorism,
p11
aVit would be that it's one of criminality, one of war.
p12
aVSo how are you going to respond to it?
p13
aVNaturally, it would follow that you meet kind with kind.
p14
aVYou fight it. If you have a more modernist approach,
p15
aVand your perception of terrorism is almost cause-and-effect,
p16
aVthen naturally from that, the responses that come out of it
p17
aVare much more asymmetrical.
p18
aa(lp19
VWe live in a modern, global world.
p20
aVTerrorists have actually adapted to it.
p21
aVIt's something we have to, too, and that means the people
p22
aVwho are working on counterterrorism responses
p23
aVhave to start, in effect, putting on
p24
aVtheir Google-tinted glasses, or whatever.
p25
aa(lp26
VFor my part, what I wanted us to do was just to look at
p27
aVterrorism as though it was a global brand,
p28
aVsay, Coca-Cola.
p29
aVBoth are fairly bad for your health. (Laughter)
p30
aVIf you look at it as a brand in those ways,
p31
aVwhat you'll come to realize is, it's a pretty flawed product.
p32
aVAs we've said, it's pretty bad for your health,
p33
aVit's bad for those who it affects,
p34
aVand it's not actually good if you're a suicide bomber either.
p35
aVIt doesn't actually do what it says on the tin.
p36
aVYou're not really going to get 72 virgins in heaven.
p37
aVIt's not going to happen, I don't think.
p38
aVAnd you're not really going to, in the '80s, end capitalism
p39
aVby supporting one of these groups. It's a load of nonsense.
p40
aa(lp41
VBut what you realize, it's got an Achilles' heel.
p42
aVThe brand has an Achilles' heel.
p43
aVWe've mentioned the health,
p44
aVbut it needs consumers to buy into it.
p45
aVThe consumers it needs are the terrorist constituency.
p46
aVThey're the people who buy into the brand, support them,
p47
aVfacilitate them, and they're the people
p48
aVwe've got to reach out to.
p49
aVWe've got to attack that brand in front of them.
p50
aa(lp51
VThere's two essential ways of doing that, if we carry on this brand theme.
p52
aVOne is reducing their market. What I mean is,
p53
aVit's their brand against our brand. We've got to compete.
p54
aVWe've got to show we're a better product.
p55
aVIf I'm trying to show we're a better product,
p56
aVI probably wouldn't do things like Guantanamo Bay.
p57
aVWe've talked there about curtailing the underlying need
p58
aVfor the product itself. You could be looking there at
p59
aVpoverty, injustice, all those sorts of things
p60
aVwhich feed terrorism.
p61
aa(lp62
VThe other thing to do is to knock the product,
p63
aVattack the brand myth, as we've said.
p64
aVYou know, there's nothing heroic about killing a young kid.
p65
aVPerhaps we need to focus on that and get that message back across.
p66
aVWe've got to reveal the dangers in the product.
p67
aVOur target audience, it's not just the producers of terrorism,
p68
aVas I've said, the terrorists.
p69
aVIt's not just the marketeers of terrorism,
p70
aVwhich is those who finance, those who facilitate it,
p71
aVbut it's the consumers of terrorism.
p72
aVWe've got to get in to those homelands.
p73
aVThat's where they recruit from. That's where they get their power and strength.
p74
aVThat's where their consumers come from.
p75
aVAnd we have to get our messaging in there.
p76
aVSo the essentials are, we've got to have interaction
p77
aVin those areas, with the terrorists, the facilitators, etc.
p78
aVWe've got to engage, we've got to educate,
p79
aVand we've got to have dialogue.
p80
aa(lp81
VNow, staying on this brand thing for just a few more seconds,
p82
aVthink about delivery mechanisms.
p83
aVHow are we going to do these attacks?
p84
aVWell, reducing the market is really one for governments
p85
aVand civil society. We've got to show we're better.
p86
aVWe've got to show our values.
p87
aVWe've got to practice what we preach.
p88
aVBut when it comes to knocking the brand,
p89
aVif the terrorists are Coca-Cola and we're Pepsi,
p90
aVI don't think, being Pepsi, anything we say about Coca-Cola,
p91
aVanyone's going to believe us.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo we've got to find a different mechanism,
p94
aVand one of the best mechanisms I've ever come across
p95
aVis the victims of terrorism.
p96
aVThey are somebody who can actually stand there and say,
p97
aV"This product's crap. I had it and I was sick for days.
p98
aVIt burnt my hand, whatever." You believe them.
p99
aVYou can see their scars. You trust them.
p100
aVBut whether it's victims, whether it's governments,
p101
aVNGOs, or even the Queen yesterday, in Northern Ireland,
p102
aVwe have to interact and engage with those different
p103
aVlayers of terrorism, and, in effect,
p104
aVwe do have to have a little dance with the devil.
p105
aa(lp106
VThis is my favorite part of my speech.
p107
aVI wanted to blow you all up to try and make a point,
p108
aVbut \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p109
aVTED, for health and safety reasons, have told me
p110
aVI've got to do a countdown, so
p111
aVI feel like a bit of an Irish or Jewish terrorist,
p112
aVsort of a health and safety terrorist, and I \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p113
aVI've got to count 3, 2, 1, and
p114
aVit's a bit alarming, so thinking of what my motto would be,
p115
aVand it would be, "Body parts, not heart attacks."
p116
aVSo 3, 2, 1. (Explosion sound)
p117
aVVery good. (Laughter)
p118
aVNow, lady in 15J was a suicide bomber amongst us all.
p119
aVWe're all victims of terrorism.
p120
aVThere's 625 of us in this room. We're going to be scarred for life.
p121
aVThere was a father and a son who sat in that seat over there.
p122
aVThe son's dead. The father lives.
p123
aVThe father will probably kick himself for years to come
p124
aVthat he didn't take that seat instead of his kid.
p125
aVHe's going to take to alcohol, and he's probably
p126
aVgoing to kill himself in three years. That's the stats.
p127
aVThere's a very young, attractive lady over here,
p128
aVand she has something which I think's the worst form
p129
aVof psychological, physical injury I've ever seen
p130
aVout of a suicide bombing: It's human shrapnel.
p131
aVWhat it means is, when she sat in a restaurant
p132
aVin years to come, 10 years to come, 15 years to come,
p133
aVor she's on the beach, every so often she's going to start
p134
aVrubbing her skin, and out of there will come
p135
aVa piece of that shrapnel.
p136
aVAnd that is a hard thing for the head to take.
p137
aVThere's a lady over there as well who lost her legs
p138
aVin this bombing.
p139
aVShe's going to find out that she gets a pitiful amount
p140
aVof money off our government
p141
aVfor looking after what's happened to her.
p142
aVShe had a daughter who was going to go to one of the best
p143
aVuniversities. She's going to give up university
p144
aVto look after Mum.
p145
aVWe're all here, and all of those who watch it
p146
aVare going to be traumatized by this event,
p147
aVbut all of you here who are victims are going to learn
p148
aVsome hard truths.
p149
aVThat is, our society, we sympathize, but after a while,
p150
aVwe start to ignore. We don't do enough as a society.
p151
aVWe do not look after our victims, and we do not enable them,
p152
aVand what I'm going to try and show is that actually,
p153
aVvictims are the best weapon we have
p154
aVagainst more terrorism.
p155
aa(lp156
VHow would the government at the turn of the millennium
p157
aVapproach today? Well, we all know.
p158
aVWhat they'd have done then is an invasion.
p159
aVIf the suicide bomber was from Wales,
p160
aVgood luck to Wales, I'd say.
p161
aVKnee-jerk legislation, emergency provision legislation \u2014
p162
aVwhich hits at the very basis of our society, as we all know \u2014
p163
aVit's a mistake.
p164
aVWe're going to drive prejudice throughout Edinburgh,
p165
aVthroughout the U.K., for Welsh people.
p166
aa(lp167
VToday's approach, governments have learned from their mistakes.
p168
aVThey are looking at what I've started off on,
p169
aVon these more asymmetrical approaches to it,
p170
aVmore modernist views, cause and effect.
p171
aVBut mistakes of the past are inevitable.
p172
aVIt's human nature.
p173
aVThe fear and the pressure to do something on them
p174
aVis going to be immense. They are going to make mistakes.
p175
aVThey're not just going to be smart.
p176
aa(lp177
VThere was a famous Irish terrorist who once summed up
p178
aVthe point very beautifully. He said,
p179
aV"The thing is, about the British government, is, is that it's got
p180
aVto be lucky all the time, and we only have to be lucky once."
p181
aa(lp182
VSo what we need to do is we have to effect it.
p183
aVWe've got to start thinking about being more proactive.
p184
aVWe need to build an arsenal of noncombative weapons
p185
aVin this war on terrorism.
p186
aVBut of course, it's ideas \u2014 is not something that governments do very well.
p187
aa(lp188
VI want to go back just to before the bang, to this idea of
p189
aVbrand, and I was talking about Coke and Pepsi, etc.
p190
aVWe see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war.
p191
aVThey'll see it as freedom fighters and truth
p192
aVagainst injustice, imperialism, etc.
p193
aa(lp194
VWe do have to see this as a deadly battlefield.
p195
aVIt's not just [our] flesh and blood they want.
p196
aVThey actually want our cultural souls, and that's why
p197
aVthe brand analogy is a very interesting way of looking at this.
p198
aVIf we look at al Qaeda. Al Qaeda was essentially
p199
aVa product on a shelf in a souk somewhere
p200
aVwhich not many people had heard of.
p201
aV9/11 launched it. It was its big marketing day,
p202
aVand it was packaged for the 21st century. They knew what they were doing.
p203
aVThey were effectively [doing] something in this brand image
p204
aVof creating a brand which can be franchised around
p205
aVthe world, where there's poverty, ignorance and injustice.
p206
aa(lp207
VWe, as I've said, have got to hit that market,
p208
aVbut we've got to use our heads rather than our might.
p209
aVIf we perceive it in this way as a brand, or other ways of thinking at it like this,
p210
aVwe will not resolve or counter terrorism.
p211
aa(lp212
VWhat I'd like to do is just briefly go through a few examples
p213
aVfrom my work on areas where we try and approach these things differently.
p214
aVThe first one has been dubbed "lawfare,"
p215
aVfor want of a better word.
p216
aVWhen we originally looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists,
p217
aVeveryone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks
p218
aVand crackpots. Now it's got a title. Everyone's doing it.
p219
aVThere's a bomb, people start suing.
p220
aVBut one of the first early cases on this was the Omagh Bombing.
p221
aVA civil action was brought from 1998.
p222
aVIn Omagh, bomb went off, Real IRA,
p223
aVmiddle of a peace process.
p224
aVThat meant that the culprits couldn't really be prosecuted
p225
aVfor lots of reasons, mostly to do with the peace process
p226
aVand what was going on, the greater good.
p227
aVIt also meant, then, if you can imagine this,
p228
aVthat the people who bombed your children
p229
aVand your husbands were walking around the supermarket
p230
aVthat you lived in.
p231
aVSome of those victims said enough is enough.
p232
aVWe brought a private action, and thank God, 10 years later,
p233
aVwe actually won it. There is a slight appeal on
p234
aVat the moment so I have to be a bit careful,
p235
aVbut I'm fairly confident.
p236
aa(lp237
VWhy was it effective?
p238
aVIt was effective not just because justice was seen to be done
p239
aVwhere there was a huge void.
p240
aVIt was because the Real IRA and other terrorist groups,
p241
aVtheir whole strength is from the fact that they are
p242
aVan underdog. When we put the victims as the underdog
p243
aVand flipped it, they didn't know what to do.
p244
aVThey were embarrassed. Their recruitment went down.
p245
aVThe bombs actually stopped \u2014 fact \u2014 because of this action.
p246
aVWe became, or those victims became, more importantly,
p247
aVa ghost that haunted the terrorist organization.
p248
aa(lp249
VThere's other examples. We have a case called Almog
p250
aVwhich is to do with a bank that was,
p251
aVallegedly, from our point of view,
p252
aVgiving rewards to suicide bombers.
p253
aVJust by bringing the very action,
p254
aVthat bank has stopped doing it, and indeed,
p255
aVthe powers that be around the world, which for real politic
p256
aVreasons before, couldn't actually deal with this issue,
p257
aVbecause there was lots of competing interests,
p258
aVhave actually closed down those loopholes in the banking system.
p259
aVThere's another case called the McDonald case,
p260
aVwhere some victims of Semtex, of the Provisional IRA bombings,
p261
aVwhich were supplied by Gaddafi, sued,
p262
aVand that action has led to amazing things for new Libya.
p263
aVNew Libya has been compassionate towards those victims,
p264
aVand started taking it \u2014 so it started a whole new dialogue there.
p265
aVBut the problem is, we need more and more support
p266
aVfor these ideas and cases.
p267
aa(lp268
VCivil affairs and civil society initiatives.
p269
aVA good one is in Somalia. There's a war on piracy.
p270
aVIf anyone thinks you can have a war on piracy
p271
aVlike a war on terrorism and beat it, you're wrong.
p272
aVWhat we're trying to do there is turn pirates to fisherman.
p273
aVThey used to be fisherman, of course,
p274
aVbut we stole their fish and dumped a load of toxic waste
p275
aVin their water, so what we're trying to do is create
p276
aVsecurity and employment by bringing a coastguard
p277
aValong with the fisheries industry, and I can guarantee you,
p278
aVas that builds, al Shabaab and such likes will not have
p279
aVthe poverty and injustice any longer to prey on those people.
p280
aVThese initiatives cost less than a missile,
p281
aVand certainly less than any soldier's life,
p282
aVbut more importantly, it takes the war to their homelands,
p283
aVand not onto our shore,
p284
aVand we're looking at the causes.
p285
aa(lp286
VThe last one I wanted to talk about was dialogue.
p287
aVThe advantages of dialogue are obvious.
p288
aVIt self-educates both sides, enables a better understanding,
p289
aVreveals the strengths and weaknesses,
p290
aVand yes, like some of the speakers before,
p291
aVthe shared vulnerability does lead to trust, and
p292
aVit does then become, that process, part of normalization.
p293
aVBut it's not an easy road. After the bomb,
p294
aVthe victims are not into this.
p295
aVThere's practical problems.
p296
aVIt's politically risky for the protagonists
p297
aVand for the interlocutors. On one occasion
p298
aVI was doing it, every time I did a point that they didn't like,
p299
aVthey actually threw stones at me,
p300
aVand when I did a point they liked,
p301
aVthey starting shooting in the air, equally not great. (Laughter)
p302
aVWhatever the point, it gets to the heart of the problem,
p303
aVyou're doing it, you're talking to them.
p304
aa(lp305
VNow, I just want to end with saying, if we follow reason,
p306
aVwe realize that I think we'd all say that we want to
p307
aVhave a perception of terrorism which is not just a pure
p308
aVmilitary perception of it.
p309
aVWe need to foster more
p310
aVmodern and asymmetrical responses to it.
p311
aVThis isn't about being soft on terrorism.
p312
aVIt's about fighting them on contemporary battlefields.
p313
aVWe must foster innovation, as I've said.
p314
aVGovernments are receptive. It won't come from those dusty corridors.
p315
aVThe private sector has a role.
p316
aVThe role we could do right now is going away
p317
aVand looking at how we can support victims around the world
p318
aVto bring initiatives.
p319
aa(lp320
VIf I was to leave you with some big questions here which
p321
aVmay change one's perception to it, and who knows what
p322
aVthoughts and responses will come out of it,
p323
aVbut did myself and my terrorist group actually need
p324
aVto blow you up to make our point?
p325
aVWe have to ask ourselves these questions, however unpalatable.
p326
aVHave we been ignoring an injustice or a humanitarian
p327
aVstruggle somewhere in the world?
p328
aVWhat if, actually, engagement on poverty and injustice
p329
aVis exactly what the terrorists wanted us to do?
p330
aVWhat if the bombs are just simply wake-up calls for us?
p331
aVWhat happens if that bomb went off
p332
aVbecause we didn't have any thoughts and things in place
p333
aVto allow dialogue to deal with these things and interaction?
p334
aa(lp335
VWhat is definitely uncontroversial
p336
aVis that, as I've said, we've got to stop being reactive,
p337
aVand more proactive, and I just want to leave you
p338
aVwith one idea, which is that
p339
aVit's a provocative question for you to think about,
p340
aVand the answer will require sympathy with the devil.
p341
aVIt's a question that's been tackled by many great thinkers
p342
aVand writers: What if society actually needs crisis to change?
p343
aVWhat if society actually needs terrorism
p344
aVto change and adapt for the better?
p345
aVIt's those Bulgakov themes, it's that picture of Jesus
p346
aVand the Devil hand in hand in Gethsemane
p347
aVwalking into the moonlight.
p348
aVWhat it would mean is that humans,
p349
aVin order to survive in development,
p350
aVquite Darwinian spirit here,
p351
aVinherently must dance with the devil.
p352
aa(lp353
VA lot of people say that communism was defeated
p354
aVby the Rolling Stones. It's a good theory.
p355
aVMaybe the Rolling Stones has a place in this.
