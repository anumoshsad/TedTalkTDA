VWhen I was about 16 years old
p4
aVI can remember flipping through channels at home during summer vacation,
p5
aVlooking for a movie to watch on HBO \u2014
p6
aVand how many of you remember "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"?
p7
aVOh yeah, great movie, right? \u2014 Well, I saw Matthew Broderick on the screen, and so I thought,
p8
aV"Sweet! Ferris Bueller. I'll watch this!"
p9
aVIt wasn't Ferris Bueller. And forgive me Matthew Broderick,
p10
aVI know you've done other movies besides Ferris Bueller, but that's how I remember you; you're Ferris.
p11
aVBut you weren't doing Ferris-y things at the time; you were doing gay things at the time.
p12
aa(lp13
VHe was in a movie called "Torch Song Trilogy."
p14
aVAnd "Torch Song Trilogy" was based on a play about this drag queen who essentially was looking for love.
p15
aVLove and respect \u2014 that's what the whole film was about.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd as I'm watching it, I'm realizing that they're talking about me.
p18
aVNot the drag queen part \u2014 I am not shaving my hair for anyone \u2014 but the gay part.
p19
aVThe finding love and respect, the part about trying to find your place in the world.
p20
aVSo as I'm watching this, I see this powerful scene that brought me to tears,
p21
aVand it stuck with me for the past 25 years.
p22
aVAnd there's this quote that the main character, Arnold, tells his mother
p23
aVas they're fighting about who he is and the life that he lives.
p24
aa(lp25
V"There's one thing more \u2014 there's just one more thing you better understand.
p26
aVI've taught myself to sew, cook, fix plumbing, build furniture,
p27
aVI can even pat myself on the back when necessary,
p28
aVall so I don't have to ask anyone for anything.
p29
aVThere's nothing I need from anyone except for love and respect,
p30
aVand anyone who can't give me those two things has no place in my life."
p31
aa(lp32
VI remember that scene like it was yesterday; I was 16, I was in tears, I was in the closet,
p33
aVand I'm looking at these two people, Ferris Bueller and some guy I'd never seen before,
p34
aVfighting for love.
p35
aVWhen I finally got to a place in my life
p36
aVwhere I came out and accepted who I was, and was really quite happy, to tell you the truth,
p37
aVI was happily gay and I guess that's supposed to be right because gay means happy too.
p38
aVI realized there were a lot of people who weren't as gay as I was \u2014
p39
aVgay being happy, not gay being attracted to the same sex.
p40
aVIn fact, I heard that there was a lot of hate and a lot of anger
p41
aVand a lot of frustration and a lot of fear
p42
aVabout who I was and the gay lifestyle.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow, I'm sitting here trying to figure out "the gay lifestyle," "the gay lifestyle,"
p45
aVand I keep hearing this word over and over and over again: lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle.
p46
aVI've even heard politicians say that the gay lifestyle is a greater threat
p47
aVto civilization than terrorism.
p48
aVThat's when I got scared.
p49
aVBecause I'm thinking, if I'm gay and I'm doing something that's going to destroy civilization,
p50
aVI need to figure out what this stuff is, and I need to stop doing it right now.
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VSo, I took a look at my life, a hard look at my life,
p54
aVand I saw some things very disturbing.
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aVAnd I want to begin sharing these evil things that I've been doing with you,
p57
aVstarting with my mornings.
p58
aVI drink coffee.
p59
aVNot only do I drink coffee, I know other gay people who drink coffee.
p60
aVI get stuck in traffic \u2014
p61
aVevil, evil traffic.
p62
aVSometimes I get stuck in lines at airports.
p63
aa(lp64
VI look around, and I go, "My God, look at all these gay people!
p65
aVWe're all trapped in these lines! These long lines trying to get on an airplane!
p66
aVMy God, this lifestyle that I'm living is so freaking evil!"
p67
aa(lp68
VI clean up. This is not an actual photograph of my son's room; his is messier.
p69
aVAnd because I have a 15-year-old, all I do is cook and cook and cook.
p70
aVAny parents out there of teenagers? All we do is cook for these people \u2014
p71
aVthey eat two, three, four dinners a night \u2014 it's ridiculous!
p72
aVThis is the gay lifestyle.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd after I'm done cooking and cleaning and standing in line and getting stuck in traffic,
p75
aVmy partner and I, we get together
p76
aVand we decide that we're gonna go and have some wild and crazy fun.
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aVWe're usually in bed before we find out who's eliminated on "American Idol."
p79
aVWe have to wake up and find out the next day who's still on
p80
aVbecause we're too freaking tired to hear who stays on.
p81
aVThis is the super duper evil gay lifestyle.
p82
aVRun for your heterosexual lives, people.
p83
aV(Applause)
p84
aa(lp85
VWhen my partner, Steve, and I first started dating,
p86
aVhe told me this story about penguins.
p87
aVAnd I didn't know where he was going with it at first.
p88
aVHe was kind of a little bit nervous when he was sharing it with me, but he told me that
p89
aVwhen a penguin finds a mate that they want to spend the rest of their life with,
p90
aVthey present them with a pebble \u2014 the perfect pebble.
p91
aVAnd then he reaches into his pocket, and he brings this out to me.
p92
aVAnd I looked at it, and I was like, this is really cool.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd he says, "I want to spend the rest of my life with you."
p95
aa(lp96
VSo I wear this whenever I have to do something that makes me a little nervous,
p97
aVlike, I don't know, a TEDx talk.
p98
aVI wear this when I am apart from him for a long period of time.
p99
aVAnd sometimes I just wear it just because.
p100
aa(lp101
VHow many people out there are in love? Anyone in love out there?
p102
aVYou might be gay.
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aVBecause I, too, am in love, and apparently that's part of the gay lifestyle that I warned you about.
p105
aV(Applause)
p106
aVYou may want to tell your spouse. Who, if they're in love, might be gay as well.
p107
aVHow many of you are single? Any single people out there?
p108
aVYou too might be gay! Because I know some gay people who are also single.
p109
aVIt's really scary, this gay lifestyle thing; it's super duper evil and there's no end to it!
p110
aVIt goes and goes and engulfs!
p111
aa(lp112
VIt's really quite silly, isn't it?
p113
aVThat's why I'm so happy to finally hear President Obama come out and say
p114
aV(Applause)
p115
aVthat he supports \u2014
p116
aV(Applause)
p117
aVthat he supports marriage equality.
p118
aVIt's a wonderful day in our country's history; it's a wonderful day in the globe's history
p119
aVto be able to have an actual sitting president say, enough of this \u2014
p120
aVfirst to himself, and then to the rest of the world.
p121
aVIt's wonderful.
p122
aa(lp123
VBut there's something that's been disturbing me since he
p124
aVmade that remark just a short time ago.
p125
aVAnd that is, apparently, this is just another move by the gay activists
p126
aVthat's on the gay agenda.
p127
aVAnd I'm disturbed by this because I've been openly gay now for quite some time.
p128
aVI've been to all of the functions, I've been to fundraisers,
p129
aVI've written about the topic, and I have yet to receive my copy of this gay agenda.
p130
aV(Laughter)
p131
aVI've paid my dues on time,
p132
aV(Laughter)
p133
aVI've marched in gay pride flags parades and the whole nine,
p134
aVand I've yet to see a copy of the gay agenda.
p135
aVIt's very, very frustrating, and I was feeling left out, like I wasn't quite gay enough.
p136
aa(lp137
VBut then something wonderful happened: I was out shopping, as I tend to do,
p138
aVand I came across a bootleg copy of the official gay agenda.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd I said to myself, "LZ, for so long, you have been denied this.
p141
aVWhen you get in front of this crowd, you're gonna share the news.
p142
aVYou're gonna spread the gay agenda so no one else has to wonder,
p143
aVwhat exactly is in the gay agenda?
p144
aVWhat are these gays up to?
p145
aVWhat do they want?"
p146
aa(lp147
VSo, without further ado, I will present to you, ladies and gentlemen \u2014
p148
aVnow be careful, 'cause it's evil \u2014 a copy,
p149
aVthe official copy, of the gay agenda.
p150
aV(Music)
p151
aVThe gay agenda, people!
p152
aV(Applause)
p153
aVThere it is!
p154
aVDid you soak it all in? The gay agenda.
p155
aa(lp156
VSome of you may be calling it, what,
p157
aVthe Constitution of the United States, is that what you call it too?
p158
aVThe U.S. Constitution is the gay agenda.
p159
aVThese gays, people like me, want to be treated like full citizens
p160
aVand it's all written down in plain sight.
p161
aVI was blown away when I saw it. I was like, wait, this is the gay agenda?
p162
aVWhy didn't you just call it the Constitution so I knew what you were talking about?
p163
aVI wouldn't have been so confused; I wouldn't have been so upset.
p164
aVBut there it is. The gay agenda.
p165
aVRun for your heterosexual lives.
p166
aa(lp167
VDid you know that in all the states where there is no shading that
p168
aVpeople who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered
p169
aVcan be kicked out of their apartments
p170
aVfor being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered?
p171
aVThat's the only reason that a landlord needs to have them removed,
p172
aVbecause there's no protection from discrimination of GLBT people.
p173
aVDid you know in the states where there's no shading that
p174
aVyou can be fired for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered?
p175
aVNot based upon the quality of your work,
p176
aVhow long you've been there, if you stink,
p177
aVjust if you're gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered.
p178
aVAll of which flies in the face of the gay agenda,
p179
aValso known as the U.S. Constitution.
p180
aVSpecifically, this little amendment right here:
p181
aa(lp182
V"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities
p183
aVof citizens of the United States."
p184
aa(lp185
VI'm looking at you, North Carolina.
p186
aVBut you're not looking at the U.S. Constitution.
p187
aVThis is the gay agenda: equality. Not special rights,
p188
aVbut the rights that were already written by these people \u2014
p189
aVthese elitists, if you will.
p190
aVEducated, well-dressed,
p191
aV(Laughter)
p192
aVsome would dare say questionably dressed.
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aVNonetheless, our forefathers, right?
p195
aVThe people that, we say, knew what they were doing when they wrote the Constitution \u2014
p196
aVthe gay agenda, if you will.
p197
aVAll of that flies in the face of what they did.
p198
aa(lp199
VThat is the reason why I felt it was imperative that
p200
aVI presented you with this copy of the gay agenda.
p201
aVBecause I figured if I made it funny, you wouldn't be as threatened.
p202
aVI figured if I was a bit irreverent, you wouldn't find it serious.
p203
aVBut when you see the map, and you see our state of Michigan \u2014
p204
aVit's legal to fire someone
p205
aVfor being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered,
p206
aVthat it's legal to remove someone from their home
p207
aVbecause they're gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered,
p208
aVthen you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality
p209
aVis not about stripping someone's rights away,
p210
aVit's about granting them the rights that [have] already been stated.
p211
aVAnd we're just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated,
p212
aVthat we've already agreed upon.
p213
aVThere are people living in fear
p214
aVof losing their jobs
p215
aVso they don't show anyone who they really are
p216
aVright here at home. This isn't just about North Carolina;
p217
aVall those states that were clear, it's legal.
p218
aa(lp219
VIf I could brag for a second,
p220
aVI have a 15-year-old son from my marriage.
p221
aVHe has a 4.0.
p222
aVHe is starting a new club at school, Policy Debate.
p223
aVHe's a budding track star;
p224
aVhe has almost every single record in middle school for every event that he competed in.
p225
aVHe volunteers.
p226
aVHe prays before he eats.
p227
aVI would like to think, as his father \u2014 and he lives with me primarily \u2014
p228
aVthat I had a little something to do with all of that.
p229
aVI would like to think that he's a good boy,
p230
aVa respectful young man. I would like to think that
p231
aVI've proven to be a capable father.
p232
aVBut if I were to go to the state of Michigan today,
p233
aVand try to adopt a young person who is in an orphanage,
p234
aVI would be disqualified for only one reason:
p235
aVbecause I'm gay.
p236
aVIt doesn't matter what I've already proven, what I can do with my heart.
p237
aVIt's because of what the state of Michigan says that I am
p238
aVthat I am disqualified for any sort of adoption.
p239
aVAnd that's not just about me,
p240
aVthat's about so many other Michiganders, U.S. citizens,
p241
aVwho don't understand why what they are
p242
aVis so much more significant than who they are.
p243
aa(lp244
VThis story just keeps playing over and over
p245
aVand over again in our country's history.
p246
aVThere was a time in which, I don't know,
p247
aVpeople who were black couldn't have the same rights.
p248
aVPeople who happened to be women didn't have the same rights, couldn't vote.
p249
aVThere was a point in our history in which, if you were considered disabled,
p250
aVthat an employer could just fire you, before the Americans with Disabilities Act.
p251
aVWe keep doing this over and over again.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd so here we are, 2012,
p254
aVgay agenda,
p255
aVgay lifestyle, and I'm not a good dad
p256
aVand people don't deserve to be able to protect their families
p257
aVbecause of what they are, not who they are.
p258
aVSo when you hear the words "gay lifestyle" and "gay agenda" in the future,
p259
aVI encourage you to do two things:
p260
aVOne, remember the U.S. Constitution, and then two,
p261
aVif you wouldn't mind looking to your left, please.
p262
aVLook to your right.
p263
aVThat person next to you is a brother, is a sister.
p264
aVAnd they should be treated with love and respect.
p265
aVThank you.
