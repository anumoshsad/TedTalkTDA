VWhat is it about flying cars?
p4
aVWe've wanted to do this for about a hundred years.
p5
aVAnd there are historic attempts
p6
aVthat have had some level of technical success.
p7
aVBut we haven't yet gotten to the point
p8
aVwhere on your way here this morning
p9
aVyou see something that really, truly seamlessly integrates
p10
aVthe two-dimensional world that we're comfortable in
p11
aVwith the three-dimensional sky above us \u2014
p12
aVthat, I don't know about you, but I really enjoy spending time in.
p13
aa(lp14
VWe looked at the historical attempts that had been out there
p15
aVand realized that, despite the fact
p16
aVthat we have a lot of modern innovations
p17
aVto draw on today
p18
aVthat weren't available previously \u2014
p19
aVwe have modern composite materials,
p20
aVwe have aircraft engines that get good fuel economy
p21
aVand have better power-to-rate ratios than have ever been available,
p22
aVwe have glass cockpit avionics
p23
aVthat bring the information you need to fly
p24
aVdirectly to you in the cockpit \u2014
p25
aVbut without fundamentally addressing the problem from a different perspective,
p26
aVwe realized that we were going to be getting
p27
aVthe same result that people had been getting
p28
aVfor the last hundred years,
p29
aVwhich isn't where we want to be right now.
p30
aVSo instead of trying to make a car that can fly,
p31
aVwe decided to try to make a plane that could drive.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd the result is the Terrafugia Transition.
p34
aVIt's a two-seat, single-engine airplane
p35
aVthat works just like any other small airplane.
p36
aVYou take off and land at a local airport.
p37
aVThen once you're on the ground,
p38
aVyou fold up the wings, drive it home,
p39
aVpark it in your garage.
p40
aVAnd it works.
p41
aVAfter two years of an innovative design and construction process,
p42
aVthe proof of concept made its public debut
p43
aVin 2008.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow like with anything
p46
aVthat's really different from the status quo,
p47
aVit didn't always go so well testing that aircraft.
p48
aVAnd we discovered that it's a very good thing
p49
aVthat, when you go home with something that's been broken,
p50
aVyou've actually learned a lot more
p51
aVthan when you managed to tick off all of your test objectives
p52
aVthe first time through.
p53
aVStill, we very much wanted to see
p54
aVthe aircraft that we'd all helped build
p55
aVin the air, off the ground,
p56
aVlike it was supposed to be.
p57
aVAnd on our third high-speed testing deployment
p58
aVon a bitter cold morning in upstate New York,
p59
aVwe got to do that for the first time.
p60
aVThe picture behind me was snapped by the copilot in our chase aircraft
p61
aVjust moments after the wheels got off the ground for the first time.
p62
aVAnd we were all very flattered to see that image
p63
aVbecome a symbol of accomplishing something
p64
aVthat people had thought was impossible
p65
aVreally the world over.
p66
aa(lp67
VThe flight testing that followed that
p68
aVwas as basic and low-risk as we could make it,
p69
aVbut it still accomplished what we needed to
p70
aVto take the program to the next step
p71
aVand to gain the credibility that we needed
p72
aVwithin our eventual market, the general aviation community,
p73
aVand with the regulators
p74
aVthat govern the use of design of aircraft, particularly in the States.
p75
aVThe FAA, about a year ago,
p76
aVgave us an exemption for the Transition
p77
aVto allow us to have an additional 110 lbs.
p78
aVwithin the light sport aircraft category.
p79
aVNow that doesn't sound like a lot, but it's very important,
p80
aVbecause being able to deliver the Transition as a light sport aircraft
p81
aVmakes it simpler for us to certify it,
p82
aVbut it also makes it much easier
p83
aVfor you to learn how to fly it.
p84
aVA sport pilot can be certificated
p85
aVin as little as 20 hours of flight time.
p86
aVAnd at 110 lbs.,
p87
aVthat's very important for solving the other side of the equation \u2014
p88
aVdriving.
p89
aa(lp90
VIt turns out that driving,
p91
aVwith its associated design implementation and regulatory hurdles,
p92
aVis actually a harder problem to solve than flying.
p93
aVFor those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground,
p94
aVthis may be counter-intuitive,
p95
aVbut driving has potholes, cobblestones,
p96
aVpedestrians, other drivers
p97
aVand a rather long and detailed list
p98
aVof federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with.
p99
aVFortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention,
p100
aVand a lot of the design work
p101
aVthat we're the most proud of with the aircraft
p102
aVcame out of solving the unique problems
p103
aVof operating it on the ground \u2014
p104
aVeverything from a continuously-variable transmission
p105
aVand liquid-based cooling system
p106
aVthat allows us to use an aircraft engine
p107
aVin stop-and-go traffic,
p108
aVto a custom-designed gearbox
p109
aVthat powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground,
p110
aVto the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment,
p111
aVto crash safety features.
p112
aVWe have a carbon fiber safety cage
p113
aVthat protects the occupants
p114
aVfor less than 10 percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car.
p115
aa(lp116
VNow this also, as good as it is, wasn't quite enough.
p117
aVThe regulations for vehicles on the road
p118
aVweren't written with an airplane in mind.
p119
aVSo we did need a little bit of support
p120
aVfrom the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
p121
aVNow you may have seen in the news recently,
p122
aVthey came through with us at the end of last month
p123
aVwith a few special exemptions
p124
aVthat will allow the Transition to be sold
p125
aVin the same category as SUVs and light trucks.
p126
aVAs a multi-purpose passenger vehicle,
p127
aVit is now officially "designed for occasional off-road use."
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VNow let's see it in action.
p132
aVYou can see there the wings folded up just along the side of the plane.
p133
aVYou're not powering the propeller, you're powering the wheels.
p134
aVAnd it is under seven feet tall,
p135
aVso it will fit in a standard construction garage.
p136
aVAnd that's the automated wing-folding mechanism.
p137
aVThat's real time.
p138
aVYou just push a few buttons in the cockpit, and the wings come out.
p139
aVOnce they're fully deployed,
p140
aVthere's a mechanical lock that goes into place,
p141
aVagain, from inside the cockpit.
p142
aVAnd they're now fully capable of handling
p143
aVany of the loads you would see in flight \u2014
p144
aVjust like putting down your convertible top.
p145
aVAnd you're all thinking what your neighbors would think of seeing that.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Video) Test Pilot: Until the vehicle flies,
p148
aV75 percent of your risk is that first flight.
p149
aa(lp150
VRadio: It actually flew. Yes.
p151
aa(lp152
VRadio 2: That was gorgeous.
p153
aa(lp154
VRadio: What did you think of that?
p155
aVThat was beautiful from up here, I tell you.
p156
aa(lp157
VAMD: See, we're all exceedingly excited about that little bunny hop.
p158
aVAnd our test pilot gave us
p159
aVthe best feedback you can get from a test pilot after a first flight,
p160
aVwhich was that it was "remarkably unremarkable."
p161
aVHe would go onto tell us
p162
aVthat the Transition had been the easiest airplane to land
p163
aVthat he'd flown in his entire 30-year career as a test pilot.
p164
aVSo despite making something
p165
aVthat is seemingly revolutionary,
p166
aVwe really focused on doing
p167
aVas little new as possible.
p168
aVWe leverage a lot of technology from the state-of-the-art in general aviation
p169
aVand from automotive racing.
p170
aVWhen we do have to do something truly out-of-the-box,
p171
aVwe use an incremental design, build, test, redesign cycle
p172
aVthat lets us reduce risk in baby steps.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow since we started Terrafugia about 6 years ago,
p175
aVwe've had a lot of those baby steps.
p176
aVWe've gone from being three of us
p177
aVworking in the basement at MIT while we were still in graduate school
p178
aVto about two-dozen of us
p179
aVworking in an initial production facility outside of Boston.
p180
aVWe've had to overcome challenges
p181
aVlike keeping the weight below the light sport limit that I talked about,
p182
aVfiguring out how to politely respond
p183
aVwhen a regulator tells you,
p184
aV"But that won't fit through a toll booth with the wings extended \u2014
p185
aV(Laughter)
p186
aVto all of the other associated durability and engineering issues
p187
aVthat we talked about on the ground.
p188
aVStill, if everything goes to our satisfaction
p189
aVwith the testing and construction
p190
aVof the two production prototypes
p191
aVthat we're working on right now,
p192
aVthose first deliveries
p193
aVto the, about a hundred, people who have reserved an airplane at this point
p194
aVshould begin at the end of next year.
p195
aa(lp196
VThe Transition will cost in line with other small airplanes.
p197
aVAnd I'm certainly not out to replace your Chevy,
p198
aVbut I do think that the Transition should be your next airplane.
p199
aVHere's why.
p200
aVWhile nearly all of the commercial air travel in the world
p201
aVgoes through a relatively small number of large hub airports,
p202
aVthere is a huge underutilized resource out there.
p203
aVThere are thousands of local airstrips
p204
aVthat don't see nearly as many aircraft operations a day as they could.
p205
aVOn average, there's one within 20 to 30 miles
p206
aVof wherever you are in the United States.
p207
aVThe Transition gives you
p208
aVa safer, more convenient and more fun way
p209
aVof using this resource.
p210
aa(lp211
VFor those of you who aren't yet pilots,
p212
aVthere's four main reasons why those of us who are
p213
aVdon't fly as much as we'd like to:
p214
aVthe weather, primarily,
p215
aVcost, long door-to-door travel time
p216
aVand mobility at your destination.
p217
aVNow, bad weather comes in,
p218
aVjust land, fold up the wings, drive home.
p219
aVDoesn't matter if it rains a little, you have a windshield wiper.
p220
aVInstead of paying to keep your airplane in a hanger,
p221
aVpark it in your garage.
p222
aVAnd the unleaded automotive fuel that we use
p223
aVis both cheaper and better for the environment
p224
aVthan traditional avgas.
p225
aVDoor-to-door travel time is reduced,
p226
aVbecause now, instead of lugging bags, finding a parking space,
p227
aVtaking off your shoes or pulling your airplane out of the hanger,
p228
aVyou're now just spending that time getting to where you want to go.
p229
aVAnd mobility to your destination is clearly solved.
p230
aVJust fold up the wings and keep going.
p231
aa(lp232
VThe Transition simultaneously expands our horizons
p233
aVwhile making the world a smaller, more accessible place.
p234
aVIt also continues to be a fabulous adventure.
p235
aVI hope you'll each take a moment
p236
aVto think about how you could use something like this
p237
aVto give yourself more access to your own world,
p238
aVand to make your own travel more convenient and more fun.
p239
