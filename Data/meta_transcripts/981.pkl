VEvery presentation needs this slide in it.
p4
aV(Laughter)
p5
aVIt's beautiful, isn't it?
p6
aVDo you see?
p7
aVAll the points, all the lines \u2014
p8
aVit's incredible.
p9
aVIt is the network;
p10
aVand in my case, the network has been important in media,
p11
aVbecause I get to connect to people.
p12
aVIsn't it amazing?
p13
aVThrough that, I connect to people.
p14
aVAnd the way that I've been doing it
p15
aVhas been multifaceted.
p16
aVFor example, I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aVI put together projects like Earth Sandwich,
p19
aVwhere I ask people
p20
aVto try and simultaneously place
p21
aVtwo pieces of bread
p22
aVperfectly opposite each other on the Earth.
p23
aVAnd people started laying bread in tribute,
p24
aVand eventually a team was able to do it
p25
aVbetween New Zealand and Spain.
p26
aVIt's pretty incredible \u2014 the video's online.
p27
aVConnecting to people in projects
p28
aVlike YoungmeNowme for example.
p29
aVIn YoungmeNowme, the audience was asked
p30
aVto find a childhood photograph of themselves
p31
aVand restage it as an adult.
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aVThis is the same person \u2014
p34
aVtop photo, James, bottom photo, [Jennifer].
p35
aVPoignant.
p36
aVThis was a Mother's Day gift.
p37
aV(Laughter)
p38
aVParticularly creepy.
p39
aV(Applause)
p40
aV(Laughter)
p41
aVMy favorite of these photos, which I couldn't find,
p42
aVis there's a picture of a 30 year-old woman or so
p43
aVwith a little baby on her lap,
p44
aVand the next photo is a 220-lb man
p45
aVwith a tiny, little old lady peaking over his shoulder.
p46
aa(lp47
VBut this project changed the way
p48
aVthat I thought about connecting to people.
p49
aVThis is project called Ray.
p50
aVAnd what happened was I was sent this piece of audio
p51
aVand had no idea who generated the audio.
p52
aVSomebody said, "You have to listen to this."
p53
aVAnd this is what came to me.
p54
aa(lp55
VRecording: Hi, my name is Ray,
p56
aVand on yesterday my daughter called me
p57
aVbecause she was stressed out
p58
aVbecause of things that were going on on her job
p59
aVthat she felt was quite unfair.
p60
aVBeing quite disturbed, she called for comfort,
p61
aVand I didn't really know what to tell her,
p62
aVbecause we have to deal with so much mess in our society.
p63
aVSo I was led to write this song just for her,
p64
aVjust to give her some encouragement
p65
aVwhile dealing with stress and pressures on her job.
p66
aVAnd I figured I'd put it on the Internet
p67
aVfor all employees under stress
p68
aVto help you better deal with what you're going through on your job.
p69
aVHere's how the song goes.
p70
aa(lp71
V\u266b I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b
p72
aa(lp73
V\u266b Oh, I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b
p74
aa(lp75
V\u266b Oh, if you don't leave me alone, \u266b
p76
aa(lp77
V\u266b you gonna have to send me home \u266b
p78
aa(lp79
V\u266b 'Cause I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b
p80
aa(lp81
VNow you might not be able to sing that out loud,
p82
aVbut you can hum it to yourself, and you know what the words are.
p83
aVAnd let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job.
p84
aVAll right. Stay strong. Peace.
p85
aa(lp86
VZe Frank: So \u2014 yeah.
p87
aVNo, no, no, shush. We've got to go quickly.
p88
aVSo I was so moved by this \u2014
p89
aVthis is incredible. This was connecting, right.
p90
aVThis was, at a distance,
p91
aVrealizing that someone was feeling something,
p92
aVwanting to affect them in a particular way,
p93
aVusing media to do it, putting it online
p94
aVand realizing that there was a greater impact.
p95
aVThis was incredible; this is what I wanted to do.
p96
aVSo the first thing I thought of is we have to thank him.
p97
aVAnd I asked my audience, I said, "Listen to this piece of audio.
p98
aVWe have to remix it. He's got a great voice.
p99
aVIt's actually in the key of B flat.
p100
aVAnd have to do something with it."
p101
aVHundreds of remixes came back \u2014 lots of different attempts.
p102
aVOne stood out in particular.
p103
aVIt was done by a guy named Goose.
p104
aa(lp105
VRemix: \u266b I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b
p106
aa(lp107
V\u266b Oh, I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b
p108
aa(lp109
V\u266b Oh, if you don't leave me alone, \u266b
p110
aa(lp111
V\u266b You gonna have to send me home \u266b
p112
aa(lp113
V\u266b Cuz I'm about to whip somebody's ass \u266b
p114
aa(lp115
V\u266b I'm about to whip some \u266b \u2014
p116
aa(lp117
VZF: Great, so it was incredible.
p118
aVThat song \u2014 (Applause) Thank you.
p119
aVSo that song, somebody told me that it was at a baseball game
p120
aVin Kansas City.
p121
aVIn the end,
p122
aVit was one of the top downloads
p123
aVon a whole bunch of music streaming services.
p124
aVAnd so I said, "Let's put this together in an album."
p125
aVAnd the audience came together, and they designed an album cover.
p126
aVAnd I said, "If you put it all on this, I'm going to deliver it to him,
p127
aVif you can figure out who this person is,"
p128
aVbecause all I had was his name \u2014 Ray \u2014
p129
aVand this little piece of audio
p130
aVand the fact that his daughter was upset.
p131
aVIn two weeks, they found him.
p132
aVI received and email and it said,
p133
aV"Hi, I'm Ray.
p134
aVI heard you were looking for me."
p135
aV(Laughter)
p136
aVAnd I was like, "Yeah, Ray.
p137
aVIt's been an interesting two weeks."
p138
aVAnd so I flew to St. Louis
p139
aVand met Ray,
p140
aVand he's a preacher \u2014
p141
aV(Laughter)
p142
aVamong other things.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo but anyways, here's the thing \u2014
p145
aVis it reminds me of this,
p146
aVwhich is a sign that you see in Amsterdam on every street corner.
p147
aVAnd it's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world.
p148
aVI look at this photo, and he seems really interested
p149
aVin what's going on with that button,
p150
aVbut it doesn't seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street.
p151
aV(Laughter)
p152
aVAnd it makes me think of this.
p153
aVOn street corners everywhere, people are looking at their cell phones,
p154
aVand it's easy to dismiss this
p155
aVas some sort of bad trend
p156
aVin human culture.
p157
aVBut the truth is
p158
aVlife is being lived there.
p159
aVWhen they smile \u2014
p160
aVright, you've seen people stop \u2014
p161
aVall of a sudden, life is being lived there,
p162
aVsomewhere up in that weird, dense network.
p163
aVAnd this is it, right, to feel and be felt.
p164
aVIt's the fundamental force
p165
aVthat we're all after.
p166
aVWe can build all sorts of environments
p167
aVto make it a little bit easier,
p168
aVbut ultimately, what we're trying to do
p169
aVis really connect with one other person.
p170
aVAnd that's not always going to happen in physical spaces.
p171
aVIt's also going to now happen in virtual spaces,
p172
aVand we have to get better at figuring that out.
p173
aVI think, of the people that build all this technology in the network,
p174
aVa lot of them aren't very good
p175
aVat connecting with people.
p176
aVThis is kind of like something I used to do
p177
aVin third grade.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VSo here's a series of projects
p182
aVover the last few years
p183
aVwhere I've been inspired by trying to figure out
p184
aVhow to really facilitate close connection.
p185
aVSometimes they're very, very simple things.
p186
aVA Childhood Walk, which is a project
p187
aVwhere I ask people to remember a walk
p188
aVthat they used to take as a child over and over again
p189
aVthat was sort of meaningless \u2014
p190
aVlike on the route to the bus stop, to a neighbor's house,
p191
aVand take it inside of Google Streetview.
p192
aVAnd I promise you,
p193
aVif you take that walk inside Google Streetview,
p194
aVyou come to a moment
p195
aVwhere something comes back
p196
aVand hits you in the face.
p197
aVAnd I collected those moments \u2014
p198
aVthe photos inside Google Streetview
p199
aVand the memories, specifically.
p200
aV"Our conversation started with me saying, 'I'm bored,'
p201
aVand her replying, 'When I'm bored I eat pretzels.'
p202
aVI remember this distinctly because it came up a lot."
p203
aV"Right after he told me and my brother
p204
aVhe was going to be separating from my mom,
p205
aVI remember walking to a convenience store
p206
aVand getting a cherry cola."
p207
aV"They used some of the morbidly artist footage,
p208
aVa close-up of Chad's shoes in the middle of the highway.
p209
aVI guess the shoes came off when he was hit.
p210
aVHe slept over at my house once, and he left his pillow.
p211
aVIt had 'Chad' written in magic marker on it.
p212
aVHe died long after he left the pillow at my house,
p213
aVbut we never got around to returning it."
p214
aa(lp215
VSometimes they're a little bit more abstract.
p216
aVThis is Pain Pack.
p217
aVRight after September 11th, last year,
p218
aVI was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it,
p219
aVthe way that we excise it from our bodies.
p220
aVSo what I did is I opened up a hotline \u2014
p221
aVa hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain,
p222
aVnot necessarily related to that event.
p223
aVAnd people called in and left messages like this.
p224
aa(lp225
VRecording: Okay, here's something.
p226
aVI'm not alone,
p227
aVand I am loved.
p228
aVI'm really fortunate.
p229
aVBut sometimes I feel really lonely.
p230
aVAnd when I feel that way
p231
aVeven the smallest act of kindness
p232
aVcan make me cry.
p233
aVLike even people in convenience stores
p234
aVsaying, "Have a nice day,"
p235
aVwhen they're accidentally looking me in the eye.
p236
aa(lp237
VZF: So what I did was I took those voicemails,
p238
aVand with their permission, converted them to MP3s
p239
aVand distributed them to sound editors
p240
aVwho created short sounds
p241
aVusing just those voicemails.
p242
aVAnd those were then distributed to DJs
p243
aVwho have made hundreds of songs
p244
aVusing that source material.
p245
aV(Music)
p246
aVWe don't have time to play much of it.
p247
aVYou can look at it online.
p248
aa(lp249
V"From 52 to 48 with love"
p250
aVwas a project around the time of the last election cycle,
p251
aVwhere McCain and Obama both,
p252
aVin their speeches after the election, talked about reconciliation,
p253
aVand I was like, "What the hell
p254
aVdoes that look like?"
p255
aVSo I thought, "Well let's just give it a try.
p256
aVLet's have people hold up signs about reconciliation."
p257
aVAnd so some really nice things came together.
p258
aV"I voted blue. I voted red.
p259
aVTogether, for our future."
p260
aVThese are very, very cute little things right.
p261
aVSome came from the winning party.
p262
aV"Dear 48, I promise to listen to you, to fight for you, to respect you always."
p263
aVSome came from the party who had just lost.
p264
aV"From a 48 to a 52, may your party's leadership be as classy as you,
p265
aVbut I doubt it."
p266
aVBut the truth was that as this start becoming popular,
p267
aVa couple rightwing blogs and some message boards
p268
aVapparently found it to be a little patronizing,
p269
aVwhich I could also see.
p270
aVAnd so I started getting amazing amounts of hate mail,
p271
aVdeath threats even.
p272
aVAnd one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful messages,
p273
aVand he was dressed as Batman.
p274
aVAnd he said, "I'm dressed as Batman to hide my identity."
p275
aVJust in case I thought the real Batman
p276
aVwas coming after me;
p277
aVwhich actually made me feel a little better \u2014
p278
aVlike, "Phew, it's not him."
p279
aa(lp280
VSo what I did \u2014
p281
aVunfortunately, I was harboring all this kind of
p282
aVawful experience and this pain inside of me,
p283
aVand it started to eat away at my psyche.
p284
aVAnd I was protecting the project from it, I realized. I was protecting it \u2014
p285
aVI didn't want this special, little group of photographs
p286
aVto get sullied in some way.
p287
aVSo what I did, I took all those emails,
p288
aVand I put them together into something called Angrigami,
p289
aVwhich was an origami template
p290
aVmade out of this sort of vile stuff.
p291
aVAnd I asked people to send me beautiful things
p292
aVmade out of the Angrigami.
p293
aV(Laughter)
p294
aVBut this was the emotional moment.
p295
aVOne of my viewer's uncles died on a particular day
p296
aVand he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate.
p297
aVIt's amazing.
p298
aa(lp299
VThe last thing I'm going to tell you about is a series of projects
p300
aVcalled Songs You Already Know,
p301
aVwhere the idea was,
p302
aVI was trying to figure out to address
p303
aVparticular kinds of emotions with group projects.
p304
aVSo one of them was fairly straightforward.
p305
aVA guy said that his daughter got scared at night
p306
aVand could I write a song for her, his daughter.
p307
aVAnd I said, "Oh yeah,
p308
aVI'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself
p309
aVto help herself go to sleep."
p310
aVAnd this was "Scared."
p311
aa(lp312
V(Video) \u266b This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something \u266b
p313
aa(lp314
V\u266b I don't know why but it helps me get over it \u266b
p315
aa(lp316
V\u266b The words of the song just move me along \u266b
p317
aa(lp318
V\u266b And somehow I get over it \u266b
p319
aa(lp320
V\u266b At least I don't suck at life \u266b
p321
aa(lp322
V\u266b I keep on trying despite \u266b
p323
aa(lp324
V\u266b At least I don't suck at life \u266b
p325
aa(lp326
V\u266b I keep on trying despite \u266b
p327
aa(lp328
V\u266b This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something \u266b
p329
aa(lp330
VOkay, so I wrote that song, right. Thank you.
p331
aVSo the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter's room at some point,
p332
aVand she actually was singing that song to herself.
p333
aVSo I was like, "Awesome. This is great."
p334
aa(lp335
VAnd then I got this email. And there's a little bit of a back story to this.
p336
aVAnd I don't have much time.
p337
aVBut the idea was that at one point
p338
aVI did a project called Facebook Me Equals You,
p339
aVwhere I wanted to experience what it was like
p340
aVto live as another person.
p341
aVSo I asked for people's usernames and passwords to be sent to me.
p342
aVAnd I got a lot, like 30 in a half an hour.
p343
aVAnd I shut that part down.
p344
aVAnd I chose two people to be,
p345
aVand I asked them to send me descriptions
p346
aVof how to act as them on Facebook.
p347
aVOne person sent me a very detailed description;
p348
aVthe other person didn't.
p349
aVAnd the person who didn't, it turned out,
p350
aVhad just moved to a new city and taken on a new job.
p351
aVSo, you know, people were writing me and saying, "How's your new job?"
p352
aVI was like, "I don't know.
p353
aVDidn't know I had one."
p354
aa(lp355
VBut anyway, this same person, Laura,
p356
aVended up emailing me a little bit after that project.
p357
aVAnd I felt badly for not having done a good job.
p358
aVAnd she said, "I'm really anxious, I just moved to a new town, I have this new job,
p359
aVand I've just had this incredible amount of anxiety."
p360
aVSo she had seen the "Scared" song and wondered if I could do something.
p361
aVSo I asked her, "What does it feel like when you feel this way?"
p362
aVAnd she wrote a sort of descriptive set
p363
aVof what it felt like to have had this anxiety.
p364
aVAnd so what I decided to do.
p365
aVI said, "Okay, I'll think about it."
p366
aVAnd so quietly in the background, I started sending people this.
p367
aa(lp368
V(Audio) \u266b Hey \u266b
p369
aa(lp370
V\u266b You're okay \u266b
p371
aa(lp372
V\u266b You'll be fine \u266b
p373
aa(lp374
VSo I asked people
p375
aVwhether they had basic audio capabilities,
p376
aVjust so they could sing along to the song with headphones on,
p377
aVso I could just get their voices back.
p378
aVAnd this is the kind of thing that I got back.
p379
aa(lp380
VRecording: \u266b Hey \u266b
p381
aa(lp382
V\u266b You're okay \u266b
p383
aa(lp384
V\u266b You'll be fine \u266b
p385
aa(lp386
VZF: So that's one of the better ones, really.
p387
aVBut what's awesome is, as I started getting more and more and more of them,
p388
aVall of a sudden I had 30, 40 voices from around the world.
p389
aVAnd when you put them together, something magical happens,
p390
aVsomething absolutely incredible happens,
p391
aVand all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world.
p392
aVAnd what was really great is, I'm putting all this work together in the background,
p393
aVand Laura sent me a follow-up email because a good month had passed by.
p394
aVAnd she said, "I know you've forgotten about me.
p395
aVI just want to say thanks for even considering it."
p396
aVAnd then a few days later I sent her this.
p397
aa(lp398
V(Audio) \u266b Right now, it feels like I forgot to turn the light on \u266b
p399
aa(lp400
V\u266b And things that looked so good yesterday \u266b
p401
aa(lp402
V\u266b are now shades of gray \u266b
p403
aa(lp404
V\u266b And it seems like the world is spinning \u266b
p405
aa(lp406
V\u266b while I'm standing still \u266b
p407
aa(lp408
V\u266b Or maybe I am spinning I can't tell \u266b
p409
aa(lp410
V\u266b And then you say \u266b
p411
aa(lp412
V\u266b Hey \u266b
p413
aa(lp414
V\u266b You're okay \u266b
p415
aa(lp416
V\u266b You'll be fine \u266b
p417
aa(lp418
V\u266b Just breathe \u266b
p419
aa(lp420
V\u266b And now the words sing \u266b
p421
aa(lp422
V\u266b Hey \u266b
p423
aa(lp424
V\u266b You're okay \u266b
p425
aa(lp426
V\u266b You'll be fine \u266b
p427
aa(lp428
V\u266b Just breathe \u266b
p429
aa(lp430
V\u266b Now everybody sings \u266b
p431
aa(lp432
V\u266b Hey \u266b
p433
aa(lp434
V\u266b You're okay \u266b
p435
aa(lp436
V\u266b You'll be fine \u266b
p437
aa(lp438
V\u266b Just breathe \u266b
p439
aa(lp440
V\u266b Hey \u266b
p441
aa(lp442
V\u266b You're okay \u266b
p443
aa(lp444
V\u266b You'll be fine \u266b
p445
aa(lp446
V\u266b Just breathe \u266b
p447
