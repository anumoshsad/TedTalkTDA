VWelcome to Africa! Or rather, I should say, welcome home.
p4
aVBecause this is where it all really began, isn't it?
p5
aVLooking at fossils dating back several millions of years \u2014
p6
aVit all points to evidence that life
p7
aVfor the human species as we know it began right here.
p8
aVWe are on an amazing journey the next four days.
p9
aVYou're going to hear stories of "Africa: The Next Chapter."
p10
aVFantastic tales, anecdotes from speakers.
p11
aVBut I want to turn that upside down for a moment,
p12
aVand get something out on the table and clear the air so to say.
p13
aVWhat's the worst thing you've ever heard about Africa?
p14
aVAnd this is not a rhetorical question.
p15
aVI actually want answers from you.
p16
aVGo for it! The worst.
p17
aVFamine.
p18
aVCorruption.
p19
aVMore.
p20
aVGenocide.
p21
aVAIDS.
p22
aVSlavery.
p23
aVThat's enough.
p24
aa(lp25
VWe've all heard these things.
p26
aVBut this is about Africa, the story we have not heard.
p27
aVThe stories that we want to know,
p28
aVand the stories that do exist about positive tales.
p29
aVA part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities
p30
aVthat exist on this continent,
p31
aVto separate the rhetoric from the reality, the fact from the fiction.
p32
aVTo go to the actual data and statistics that exist
p33
aVabout the actual things that are happening on the ground
p34
aVthat make Africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you.
p35
aVSo let's get going because Africa,
p36
aVto some degree, is on a turnaround.
p37
aVA turnaround in terms of how it manages its image,
p38
aVand how it takes control of its own destiny.
p39
aVAnd turnarounds are part and parcel
p40
aVof what I have focused on for most of my professional career.
p41
aVAnd it all started almost a decade ago,
p42
aVas a young consultant at McKinsey & Company
p43
aVat their first African office in Johannesburg.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd there we worked with leading CEOs
p46
aVon African issues, and African companies on turnarounds,
p47
aVmaking the companies not just the best in Africa
p48
aVbut the best globally.
p49
aVBut I really formalized this focus on turnarounds
p50
aVwhen I was completing my MBA in the United States.
p51
aVIt all began with a fantastic phone call.
p52
aVIt was from Rosabeth Moss Kanter,
p53
aVHarvard Business School guru and a professor of mine.
p54
aVAnd she said, "I want to write a case, Euvin \u2014
p55
aVa case on a public-sector leader
p56
aVthat has lessons for the corporate world."
p57
aVAnd the leader that came to mind was Nelson Mandela.
p58
aVBecause Nelson Mandela, as he took over power
p59
aVas the first democratically-elected president of South Africa,
p60
aVfaced a situation of a country
p61
aVthat could have slid into the abyss of chaos.
p62
aVBut he started the country on a path of a positive cycle.
p63
aa(lp64
VNow the case, "Nelson Mandela: Change Leader,"
p65
aVbecame part of the research base for a chapter
p66
aVin Rosabeth's new book called "Confidence."
p67
aVAnd "Confidence" became a New York Times bestseller
p68
aVand topped Business Week's hardcover bestseller list.
p69
aVAnd why I tell you this story is because later, when I was interviewed
p70
aVon SABC Africa, on a pan-African broadcast, they asked,
p71
aV"What is your key lesson, or the key thing you enjoy the most?" \u2014
p72
aVbecause it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project.
p73
aVThe lesson from that was that it was Africa \u2014 an African story \u2014
p74
aVthat was used to share news with the rest of the world
p75
aVof what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds.
p76
aVAfrica was being used as a success story!
p77
aa(lp78
VSo I want to share with you a personal story
p79
aVabout a turnaround or a transformation.
p80
aVAnd that has to do with me
p81
aVbecause in 1994, I packed a few things into a backpack
p82
aVand headed off for a year of travel
p83
aVin the middle of my university career.
p84
aVYou should have seen my parents' reaction!
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VBut very soon, I found myself from the southern part of Africa,
p89
aVin South Africa \u2014 at the very north, in Egypt.
p90
aVAnd I sought out the most remote places.
p91
aVI went to the Siwa Oasis. That was one of my stops.
p92
aVAnd the Siwa Oasis is famous for several things,
p93
aVbut the key thing is that it was the place
p94
aVthat Alexander the Great went to
p95
aVwhen he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him.
p96
aVAnd legend has it that Alexander trekked through this desert.
p97
aVHalf his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm.
p98
aVAnd myth says that he had an audience with the oracle,
p99
aVand it foretold his destiny of greatness.
p100
aVThis was 300 BC.
p101
aVSo Africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow, the thing I remember about Siwa
p104
aVwas the magical view of the sky at night.
p105
aVWith no natural light source, Siva is one of these amazing places
p106
aVthat when you look up you see a perfect tapestry.
p107
aVFast forward to 2002.
p108
aVI'm sitting in Cambridge, Massachusetts
p109
aVat the Healthcare Development Conference.
p110
aVAnd I see the same picture, but from the opposite side.
p111
aVA satellite picture looking down at the earth.
p112
aVAnd it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me
p113
aVbecause I'll never forget it. I remember the very moment.
p114
aVAnd I wanted to share that image with you of what I saw at that point.
p115
aVThe first thing that I saw was North America at night \u2014
p116
aVglowing, in all its glory. A warm feeling. Light.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd then I saw it \u2014 Africa. Quite literally the "Dark Continent."
p119
aVAnd while Africa may be dark,
p120
aVthe thing that brought the message home to me
p121
aVwas that this is the challenge we are facing,
p122
aVbut it's also the opportunity.
p123
aVBecause whilst Africa may be dark \u2014 other than the few specks
p124
aVthat exist north and in the south and other areas \u2014
p125
aVit's aglow with the light in the hearts
p126
aVof the millions of people that are there.
p127
aVEntrepreneurs, dynamic people, people with hope.
p128
aVIt was George Kimble, the geographer, who said
p129
aVthat, "The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it."
p130
aVSo let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent
p131
aVthat has so much to offer.
p132
aa(lp133
VLet's start unpacking it.
p134
aVAfrica is the second-largest continent, a landmass second from Asia.
p135
aVIt also is the second most populated continent,
p136
aVwith 900 million people.
p137
aVIn fact \u2014 coming back to the land mass \u2014 Africa is so big
p138
aVthat you could fit in the continental United States,
p139
aVChina, and the entire Europe into Africa, and still have space.
p140
aVAfrica is home to over 1,000 languages \u2014
p141
aV2,000 is another estimate that's out there \u2014
p142
aVwith over 2,000 languages and dialects.
p143
aVBut you could say, "Invest in Africa in over 1,000 languages,
p144
aVand it wouldn't make a difference."
p145
aVWhat does the data say?
p146
aVAs an investment banker, I'm in the cross-flow of information
p147
aVand the changes that are taking place in capital markets.
p148
aVSo I want to share with you some of these bellwether signals, or signs,
p149
aVand winds of change that are sweeping this continent.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo let's start on that.
p152
aVAnd let's start at the high level, on the macro-factors.
p153
aVInflation, in general, is coming down across Africa \u2014
p154
aVthat's the first sign \u2014
p155
aVin many countries reaching double-digit figures.
p156
aVSo let's start looking at some of those.
p157
aVI call it my Z.E.N. cluster.
p158
aVZambia: from 2004 to 2006, moves from the 18 percent in inflation
p159
aVto the nine percent.
p160
aVEgypt: from the 16 percent to about 8.4 percent.
p161
aVNigeria: a similar situation,
p162
aVfrom the 16 percent to the eight percent. Single digits.
p163
aVMore fascinating, you have other countries \u2014 South Africa,
p164
aVMauritius, Namibia \u2014 all in single digits.
p165
aVBut that's just part of the story. You have a similar trend with currencies \u2014
p166
aVcurrencies going through an extreme time of stability.
p167
aVBut that's looking at the big picture.
p168
aVAnd the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country.
p169
aVIt's made up \u2014
p170
aa(lp171
V(Applause)
p172
aa(lp173
VIt's made up of 53 different countries.
p174
aVSo the very definition \u2014 to say "invest in Africa" is a no-go.
p175
aVIt's meaningless.
p176
aVEach country has a unique value proposition.
p177
aVYou can make money, you can lose money in Africa.
p178
aVBut opportunities, boy oh boy, they exist.
p179
aVAnd this is what today is about \u2014
p180
aVit's about discussing those very opportunities.
p181
aVSo let's start getting into the countries
p182
aVand into the specific material and data.
p183
aVI was recently elected, as Emeka mentioned,
p184
aVas the President of the South African Chamber of Commerce in America.
p185
aVAnd I'm very proud and happy to be in that role
p186
aVbecause it is a fascinating position to be in.
p187
aVTo hear this dialogue that's just increasing in tenor and velocity,
p188
aVof decisions about trade and companies wanting to come.
p189
aVSo the first port of call: let's talk a little bit about South Africa.
p190
aVBut not the South Africa we always talk about \u2014
p191
aVthe gold, the minerals, the First World infrastructure \u2014
p192
aVa bit about the other side of it.
p193
aa(lp194
VFor example, South Africa was recently voted as the top destination
p195
aVfor the top 1,000 UK companies for offshore call-centers.
p196
aVSame language, timeline, et cetera. Makes sense.
p197
aVOther headlines that have recently reached South Africa
p198
aVwere Bain Capital and KKR, the big boys of private equity.
p199
aVHeadline in South Africa: "They have landed." Quite ominous.
p200
aVBut what were they there for? To acquire assets.
p201
aVBing Capital's acquisition of Edcon, a large retailer, is testimony
p202
aVto the confidence they are starting to place in the economy.
p203
aVBecause it is actually a long-term play.
p204
aVBeing a retailer, it is a play on the belief
p205
aVthat this middle-class that's growing will continue to grow,
p206
aVthat the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue.
p207
aVBut the story of Africa, and my focus, is beyond South Africa
p208
aVbecause there's so much happening.
p209
aVUndoubtedly, Nigeria is clearly a hot spot.
p210
aVChallenges \u2014 and we will hear a lot about Nigeria in these four days.
p211
aa(lp212
VBut looking at Goldman Sachs' work \u2014 we had the famous BRIC Report.
p213
aVThe new report, "The Next Eleven," highlights that by 2020
p214
aVNigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world.
p215
aVIt's an investment opportunity. Think about that.
p216
aVIs anyone \u2014 our banks, our investors \u2014
p217
aVseriously thinking about going to Nigeria?
p218
aVIf you haven't, why not?
p219
aVWhat's going on in Nigeria? A couple of things.
p220
aVI want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets.
p221
aVBellwether signs again.
p222
aVGuarantee Trust Bank recently issued the first Euro Bond
p223
aVout of Africa, and this excludes South Africa.
p224
aVBut the first Eurobond, the raising of international capital
p225
aVoffshore, off its own balance sheet,
p226
aVwithout any sovereign backing \u2014
p227
aVthat is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy.
p228
aVWithout any sovereign backing,
p229
aVa Nigerian company raising capital offshore.
p230
aVIt's just a sign of things to come.
p231
aa(lp232
VLooking at the oil industry, Africa provides 18 percent
p233
aVof the U.S.'s oil supply, with the Middle East just 16 percent.
p234
aVIt's an important strategic partner.
p235
aVLet's put Nigeria in perspective.
p236
aV2.2 to 2.4 million barrels of oil a day \u2014
p237
aVthe same league as Kuwait, the same league as Venezuela.
p238
aVBut with Africa, let's start being careful about this.
p239
aVAnd Emeka and I have had these discussions.
p240
aVWe have to move away from what's called "the curse of the commodities."
p241
aVBecause it's not about oil, it's not about commodities.
p242
aVFor Africa to truly be sustainable,
p243
aVwe have to move beyond to other industries.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo let's unpack those very quickly,
p246
aVand I'm going to move through these very, very, very fast
p247
aVbecause I can see that clock counting down.
p248
aVWhat else is going on there? Egypt.
p249
aVEgypt is launching a first large industrial zone \u2014
p250
aV2.8 billion investment.
p251
aVThe announcement just came out the last few weeks.
p252
aVClose to the Mediterranean, near Alexandria \u2014
p253
aVtextiles, petrochemicals.
p254
aVIt's being managed by a Singaporean-based management company.
p255
aVSo they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse
p256
aVacross the industries \u2014 away from oil.
p257
aa(lp258
VLet's look at agriculture. Let's look at forestry.
p259
aVWhat's going on there?
p260
aVIn Tanzania last week, we had the launch
p261
aVof the East African Organic Produce Standard.
p262
aVAgain, gathering together farmers, gathering together stakeholders
p263
aVin East Africa to get standards for organic produce. Better prices.
p264
aVIt ties in with small-scale farmers
p265
aVin terms of no pesticides, no fertilizers.
p266
aVAgain, opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price.
p267
aVUganda: the New Forest Company,
p268
aVreplanting and redeveloping their forests. Why is that important?
p269
aVAs the energy needs are met and electricity is needed [we will need]
p270
aVpoles for rolling out electricity.
p271
aVBut here is the sweetener in the deal.
p272
aVThey're going to be tapping into carbon credits.
p273
aVLet's go back to Nigeria.
p274
aVThe banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation,
p275
aVfrom over 80 banks to 25 banks. Strengthening of the system.
p276
aVBut what's going on there? Only 10 percent of the country is banked.
p277
aVThe largest population in Africa is in Nigeria.
p278
aV135 million-plus people. Think about that.
p279
aVThere are only 700 ATMs in the country. Opportunity.
p280
aa(lp281
VThe same for telecoms across the country.
p282
aVNow let's look at the continent as a whole.
p283
aVPeople look at the roads, for example, and they'd say,
p284
aV"Angola: 90 percent of roads are untarred. Ah, problem!"
p285
aVIt's more expensive to transport goods. Prices of goods go up,
p286
aVinflation is affected.
p287
aVNigeria: 70 percent of roads are untarred. Zambia: 80 percent.
p288
aVIn general, more than 50 percent of roads are untarred.
p289
aVThis is an opportunity! Energy needs \u2014 it's an opportunity.
p290
aVSo what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing?
p291
aVLet's look at the stock markets in Africa.
p292
aVIf I had to ask you, "In 2005 what was the best performing stock market
p293
aVor stock exchange in the world?" Would Egypt come to mind?
p294
aVIn 2005, the Egyptian stock exchange returned over 145 percent.
p295
aVWhat's going on in some of the other countries?
p296
aVLet's look at some 2006 numbers. Kenya: over 60 percent. Nigeria: over 40 percent.
p297
aVSouth Africa: in the 20 percents. High ones.
p298
aVThese are the trends that are taking place.
p299
aVBut in any investment decision, the key question is,
p300
aV"What is my alternative investment?"
p301
aa(lp302
VBecause in Africa today, we are competing globally for capital.
p303
aVAnd global capital is agnostic \u2014 it has no loyalties.
p304
aVThere's an overhang of capital in the U.S., and the key is yield pickup.
p305
aVWhat Africa is providing is a diversification play,
p306
aVand also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor
p307
aVthat's aware of what he or she is doing.
p308
aVNow, when looking at Africa vis-a-vis other things,
p309
aVand countries in Africa vis-a-vis other things,
p310
aVcomparisons become important.
p311
aV10 years ago there, were very few countries
p312
aVthat received sovereign ratings from
p313
aVthe Standard & Poors, Moody's and Fitch's.
p314
aVToday, 16 African countries and growing
p315
aVhave sovereign country ratings. What does this mean?
p316
aVTake Nigeria again: double B-minus \u2014
p317
aVin the league of Ukraine and Turkey. Immediately we have a comparison.
p318
aVThe backbone of making investment decisions
p319
aVfor global holders of capital.
p320
aVSome other figures. South Africa: triple B-plus. Botswana: A-plus.
p321
aVBakino Faso: B-minus. And so on.
p322
aa(lp323
VIn fact, one of the big agencies is setting up an office in Africa.
p324
aVWhy are they doing that? Because they expect investment to follow.
p325
aVSo one of the big bellwethers,
p326
aVand one of my final points I want to mention, is
p327
aVthe interesting thing I read is that CNBC
p328
aVhas launched their first African channel. Why is CNBC doing this?
p329
aVIt's the 24-hour rolling African news channel.
p330
aVThey're doing it because they are expecting things to happen.
p331
aVMe and you, the investments we are going to be making,
p332
aVthe investments the world is going to be making \u2014
p333
aVthat's the 24-hour news channel dedicated to Africa.
p334
aVSo that's the change that's coming down the pipeline.
p335
aa(lp336
VSo in conclusion, I want to turn back to that very slide
p337
aVthat made such a deep impact on me all those years ago.
p338
aVThis time [I'll] give you the entire picture that I saw in 2002,
p339
aVand ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa,
p340
aVthink about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent.
p341
aVBecause there are amazing opportunities available.
p342
aVAnd think about the concept of transformation
p343
aVin the back of your mind
p344
aVbecause things can be turned around rather quickly.
p345
aa(lp346
VIn 1899, Joseph Conrad released "The Heart of Darkness,"
p347
aVa tale of grim horror along the Congo River.
p348
aVIf one looks carefully, on the Congo River
p349
aVis one of those bright lights. And that's the very Congo river
p350
aVgenerating light \u2014 the old heart of darkness
p351
aVnow generating light with hydro-electric power.
p352
aVThat is a transformation in power of ideas.
p353
aVSo the next step, over the next four days,
p354
aVis us exploring more of these ideas.
p355
aVAnd perchance, if you can always keep this picture in your mind,
p356
aVthat when we convene maybe in the distant future, in 2020,
p357
aVthat picture will look very different.
p358
aVThank you.
