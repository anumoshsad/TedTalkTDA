VSo it's 1995,
p4
aVI'm in college,
p5
aVand a friend and I go on a road trip
p6
aVfrom Providence, Rhode Island
p7
aVto Portland, Oregon.
p8
aVAnd you know, we're young and unemployed,
p9
aVso we do the whole thing on back roads
p10
aVthrough state parks
p11
aVand national forests \u2014
p12
aVbasically the longest route we can possibly take.
p13
aVAnd somewhere in the middle of South Dakota,
p14
aVI turn to my friend
p15
aVand I ask her a question
p16
aVthat's been bothering me
p17
aVfor 2,000 miles.
p18
aV"What's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road?"
p19
aVMy friend looks at me totally blankly.
p20
aVThere's actually a gentleman in the front row
p21
aVwho's doing a perfect imitation of her look.
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVAnd I'm like, "You know,
p24
aVall the signs we keep seeing
p25
aVwith the Chinese character on them."
p26
aVShe just stares at me for a few moments,
p27
aVand then she cracks up,
p28
aVbecause she figures out what I'm talking about.
p29
aVAnd what I'm talking about is this.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVRight, the famous Chinese character for picnic area.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VI've spent the last five years of my life
p36
aVthinking about situations
p37
aVexactly like this \u2014
p38
aVwhy we sometimes misunderstand
p39
aVthe signs around us,
p40
aVand how we behave when that happens,
p41
aVand what all of this can tell us about human nature.
p42
aVIn other words, as you heard Chris say,
p43
aVI've spent the last five years
p44
aVthinking about being wrong.
p45
aVThis might strike you as a strange career move,
p46
aVbut it actually has one great advantage:
p47
aVno job competition.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVIn fact, most of us do everything we can
p50
aVto avoid thinking about being wrong,
p51
aVor at least to avoid thinking about the possibility
p52
aVthat we ourselves are wrong.
p53
aVWe get it in the abstract.
p54
aVWe all know everybody in this room makes mistakes.
p55
aVThe human species, in general, is fallible \u2014 okay fine.
p56
aa(lp57
VBut when it comes down to me, right now,
p58
aVto all the beliefs I hold,
p59
aVhere in the present tense,
p60
aVsuddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility
p61
aVgoes out the window \u2014
p62
aVand I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about.
p63
aVAnd the thing is, the present tense is where we live.
p64
aVWe go to meetings in the present tense;
p65
aVwe go on family vacations in the present tense;
p66
aVwe go to the polls and vote in the present tense.
p67
aVSo effectively, we all kind of wind up traveling through life,
p68
aVtrapped in this little bubble
p69
aVof feeling very right about everything.
p70
aa(lp71
VI think this is a problem.
p72
aVI think it's a problem for each of us as individuals,
p73
aVin our personal and professional lives,
p74
aVand I think it's a problem for all of us collectively as a culture.
p75
aVSo what I want to do today
p76
aVis, first of all, talk about why we get stuck
p77
aVinside this feeling of being right.
p78
aVAnd second, why it's such a problem.
p79
aVAnd finally, I want to convince you
p80
aVthat it is possible
p81
aVto step outside of that feeling
p82
aVand that if you can do so,
p83
aVit is the single greatest
p84
aVmoral, intellectual and creative leap you can make.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo why do we get stuck
p87
aVin this feeling of being right?
p88
aVOne reason, actually, has to do with a feeling of being wrong.
p89
aVSo let me ask you guys something \u2014
p90
aVor actually, let me ask you guys something, because you're right here:
p91
aVHow does it feel \u2014 emotionally \u2014
p92
aVhow does it feel to be wrong?
p93
aVDreadful. Thumbs down.
p94
aVEmbarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great.
p95
aVDreadful, thumbs down, embarrassing \u2014
p96
aVthank you, these are great answers,
p97
aVbut they're answers to a different question.
p98
aVYou guys are answering the question:
p99
aVHow does it feel to realize you're wrong?
p100
aV(Laughter)
p101
aVRealizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things, right?
p102
aVI mean it can be devastating, it can be revelatory,
p103
aVit can actually be quite funny,
p104
aVlike my stupid Chinese character mistake.
p105
aVBut just being wrong
p106
aVdoesn't feel like anything.
p107
aa(lp108
VI'll give you an analogy.
p109
aVDo you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon
p110
aVwhere there's this pathetic coyote
p111
aVwho's always chasing and never catching a roadrunner?
p112
aVIn pretty much every episode of this cartoon,
p113
aVthere's a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner
p114
aVand the roadrunner runs off a cliff,
p115
aVwhich is fine \u2014 he's a bird, he can fly.
p116
aVBut the thing is, the coyote runs off the cliff right after him.
p117
aVAnd what's funny \u2014
p118
aVat least if you're six years old \u2014
p119
aVis that the coyote's totally fine too.
p120
aVHe just keeps running \u2014
p121
aVright up until the moment that he looks down
p122
aVand realizes that he's in mid-air.
p123
aVThat's when he falls.
p124
aVWhen we're wrong about something \u2014
p125
aVnot when we realize it, but before that \u2014
p126
aVwe're like that coyote
p127
aVafter he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down.
p128
aVYou know, we're already wrong,
p129
aVwe're already in trouble,
p130
aVbut we feel like we're on solid ground.
p131
aVSo I should actually correct something I said a moment ago.
p132
aVIt does feel like something to be wrong;
p133
aVit feels like being right.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VSo this is one reason, a structural reason,
p138
aVwhy we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness.
p139
aVI call this error blindness.
p140
aVMost of the time,
p141
aVwe don't have any kind of internal cue
p142
aVto let us know that we're wrong about something,
p143
aVuntil it's too late.
p144
aVBut there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well \u2014
p145
aVand this one is cultural.
p146
aVThink back for a moment to elementary school.
p147
aVYou're sitting there in class,
p148
aVand your teacher is handing back quiz papers,
p149
aVand one of them looks like this.
p150
aVThis is not mine, by the way.
p151
aV(Laughter)
p152
aVSo there you are in grade school,
p153
aVand you know exactly what to think
p154
aVabout the kid who got this paper.
p155
aVIt's the dumb kid, the troublemaker,
p156
aVthe one who never does his homework.
p157
aVSo by the time you are nine years old,
p158
aVyou've already learned, first of all,
p159
aVthat people who get stuff wrong
p160
aVare lazy, irresponsible dimwits \u2014
p161
aVand second of all,
p162
aVthat the way to succeed in life
p163
aVis to never make any mistakes.
p164
aa(lp165
VWe learn these really bad lessons really well.
p166
aVAnd a lot of us \u2014
p167
aVand I suspect, especially a lot of us in this room \u2014
p168
aVdeal with them by just becoming
p169
aVperfect little A students,
p170
aVperfectionists, over-achievers.
p171
aVRight,
p172
aVMr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner?
p173
aV(Laughter)
p174
aVYou're all CFO, astrophysicists, ultra-marathoners, it turns out.
p175
aVOkay, so fine.
p176
aVExcept that then we freak out
p177
aVat the possibility that we've gotten something wrong.
p178
aVBecause according to this,
p179
aVgetting something wrong
p180
aVmeans there's something wrong with us.
p181
aVSo we just insist that we're right,
p182
aVbecause it makes us feel smart and responsible
p183
aVand virtuous and safe.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo let me tell you a story.
p186
aVA couple of years ago,
p187
aVa woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery.
p188
aVBeth Israel's in Boston.
p189
aVIt's the teaching hospital for Harvard \u2014
p190
aVone of the best hospitals in the country.
p191
aVSo this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room.
p192
aVShe's anesthetized, the surgeon does his thing \u2014
p193
aVstitches her back up, sends her out to the recovery room.
p194
aVEverything seems to have gone fine.
p195
aVAnd she wakes up, and she looks down at herself,
p196
aVand she says, "Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages?"
p197
aVWell the wrong side of her body is in bandages
p198
aVbecause the surgeon has performed a major operation
p199
aVon her left leg instead of her right one.
p200
aVWhen the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel
p201
aVspoke about this incident,
p202
aVhe said something very interesting.
p203
aVHe said, "For whatever reason,
p204
aVthe surgeon simply felt
p205
aVthat he was on the correct side of the patient."
p206
aV(Laughter)
p207
aVThe point of this story
p208
aVis that trusting too much in the feeling
p209
aVof being on the correct side of anything
p210
aVcan be very dangerous.
p211
aa(lp212
VThis internal sense of rightness
p213
aVthat we all experience so often
p214
aVis not a reliable guide
p215
aVto what is actually going on in the external world.
p216
aVAnd when we act like it is,
p217
aVand we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong,
p218
aVwell that's when we end up doing things
p219
aVlike dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico,
p220
aVor torpedoing the global economy.
p221
aVSo this is a huge practical problem.
p222
aVBut it's also a huge social problem.
p223
aa(lp224
VThink for a moment about what it means to feel right.
p225
aVIt means that you think that your beliefs
p226
aVjust perfectly reflect reality.
p227
aVAnd when you feel that way,
p228
aVyou've got a problem to solve,
p229
aVwhich is, how are you going to explain
p230
aVall of those people who disagree with you?
p231
aVIt turns out, most of us explain those people the same way,
p232
aVby resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions.
p233
aVThe first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us
p234
aVis we just assume they're ignorant.
p235
aVThey don't have access to the same information that we do,
p236
aVand when we generously share that information with them,
p237
aVthey're going to see the light and come on over to our team.
p238
aVWhen that doesn't work,
p239
aVwhen it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do
p240
aVand they still disagree with us,
p241
aVthen we move on to a second assumption,
p242
aVwhich is that they're idiots.
p243
aV(Laughter)
p244
aVThey have all the right pieces of the puzzle,
p245
aVand they are too moronic to put them together correctly.
p246
aVAnd when that doesn't work,
p247
aVwhen it turns out that people who disagree with us
p248
aVhave all the same facts we do
p249
aVand are actually pretty smart,
p250
aVthen we move on to a third assumption:
p251
aVthey know the truth,
p252
aVand they are deliberately distorting it
p253
aVfor their own malevolent purposes.
p254
aVSo this is a catastrophe.
p255
aa(lp256
VThis attachment to our own rightness
p257
aVkeeps us from preventing mistakes
p258
aVwhen we absolutely need to
p259
aVand causes us to treat each other terribly.
p260
aVBut to me, what's most baffling
p261
aVand most tragic about this
p262
aVis that it misses the whole point of being human.
p263
aVIt's like we want to imagine
p264
aVthat our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows
p265
aVand we just gaze out of them
p266
aVand describe the world as it unfolds.
p267
aVAnd we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window
p268
aVand see the exact same thing.
p269
aVThat is not true,
p270
aVand if it were, life would be incredibly boring.
p271
aVThe miracle of your mind
p272
aVisn't that you can see the world as it is.
p273
aVIt's that you can see the world as it isn't.
p274
aVWe can remember the past,
p275
aVand we can think about the future,
p276
aVand we can imagine what it's like
p277
aVto be some other person in some other place.
p278
aVAnd we all do this a little differently,
p279
aVwhich is why we can all look up at the same night sky
p280
aVand see this
p281
aVand also this
p282
aVand also this.
p283
aVAnd yeah, it is also why we get things wrong.
p284
aa(lp285
V1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing
p286
aVabout "I think therefore I am,"
p287
aVthis guy, St. Augustine, sat down
p288
aVand wrote "Fallor ergo sum" \u2014
p289
aV"I err therefore I am."
p290
aVAugustine understood
p291
aVthat our capacity to screw up,
p292
aVit's not some kind of embarrassing defect
p293
aVin the human system,
p294
aVsomething we can eradicate or overcome.
p295
aVIt's totally fundamental to who we are.
p296
aVBecause, unlike God,
p297
aVwe don't really know what's going on out there.
p298
aVAnd unlike all of the other animals,
p299
aVwe are obsessed with trying to figure it out.
p300
aVTo me, this obsession
p301
aVis the source and root
p302
aVof all of our productivity and creativity.
p303
aa(lp304
VLast year, for various reasons,
p305
aVI found myself listening to a lot of episodes
p306
aVof the Public Radio show This American Life.
p307
aVAnd so I'm listening and I'm listening,
p308
aVand at some point, I start feeling
p309
aVlike all the stories are about being wrong.
p310
aVAnd my first thought was,
p311
aV"I've lost it.
p312
aVI've become the crazy wrongness lady.
p313
aVI just imagined it everywhere,"
p314
aVwhich has happened.
p315
aVBut a couple of months later,
p316
aVI actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass, who's the host of the show.
p317
aVAnd I mentioned this to him,
p318
aVand he was like, "No actually, that's true.
p319
aVIn fact," he says,
p320
aV"as a staff, we joke
p321
aVthat every single episode of our show
p322
aVhas the same crypto-theme.
p323
aVAnd the crypto-theme is:
p324
aV'I thought this one thing was going to happen
p325
aVand something else happened instead.'
p326
aVAnd the thing is," says Ira Glass, "we need this.
p327
aVWe need these moments
p328
aVof surprise and reversal and wrongness
p329
aVto make these stories work."
p330
aVAnd for the rest of us, audience members,
p331
aVas listeners, as readers,
p332
aVwe eat this stuff up.
p333
aVWe love things like plot twists
p334
aVand red herrings and surprise endings.
p335
aVWhen it comes to our stories,
p336
aVwe love being wrong.
p337
aa(lp338
VBut, you know, our stories are like this
p339
aVbecause our lives are like this.
p340
aVWe think this one thing is going to happen
p341
aVand something else happens instead.
p342
aVGeorge Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq,
p343
aVfind a bunch of weapons of mass destruction,
p344
aVliberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East.
p345
aVAnd something else happened instead.
p346
aVAnd Hosni Mubarak
p347
aVthought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life,
p348
aVuntil he got too old or too sick
p349
aVand could pass the reigns of power onto his son.
p350
aVAnd something else happened instead.
p351
aVAnd maybe you thought
p352
aVyou were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart
p353
aVand move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together.
p354
aVAnd something else happened instead.
p355
aVAnd I have to tell you
p356
aVthat I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book
p357
aVabout a subject everybody hates
p358
aVfor an audience that would never materialize.
p359
aVAnd something else happened instead.
p360
aa(lp361
V(Laughter)
p362
aa(lp363
VI mean, this is life.
p364
aVFor good and for ill,
p365
aVwe generate these incredible stories
p366
aVabout the world around us,
p367
aVand then the world turns around and astonishes us.
p368
aVNo offense, but this entire conference
p369
aVis an unbelievable monument
p370
aVto our capacity to get stuff wrong.
p371
aVWe just spent an entire week
p372
aVtalking about innovations and advancements
p373
aVand improvements,
p374
aVbut you know why we need all of those innovations
p375
aVand advancements and improvements?
p376
aVBecause half the stuff
p377
aVthat's the most mind-boggling and world-altering \u2014
p378
aVTED 1998 \u2014
p379
aVeh.
p380
aV(Laughter)
p381
aVDidn't really work out that way, did it?
p382
aV(Laughter)
p383
aVWhere's my jet pack, Chris?
p384
aa(lp385
V(Laughter)
p386
aa(lp387
V(Applause)
p388
aa(lp389
VSo here we are again.
p390
aVAnd that's how it goes.
p391
aVWe come up with another idea.
p392
aVWe tell another story.
p393
aVWe hold another conference.
p394
aVThe theme of this one,
p395
aVas you guys have now heard seven million times,
p396
aVis the rediscovery of wonder.
p397
aVAnd to me,
p398
aVif you really want to rediscover wonder,
p399
aVyou need to step outside
p400
aVof that tiny, terrified space of rightness
p401
aVand look around at each other
p402
aVand look out at the vastness
p403
aVand complexity and mystery
p404
aVof the universe
p405
aVand be able to say,
p406
aV"Wow, I don't know.
p407
aVMaybe I'm wrong."
p408
aa(lp409
VThank you.
p410
