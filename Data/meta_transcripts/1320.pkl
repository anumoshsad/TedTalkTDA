VLauren Hodge: If you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option,
p4
aVwhich would you choose, grilled or fried chicken?
p5
aVNow most people would answer grilled,
p6
aVand it's true that grilled chicken does contain less fat and fewer calories.
p7
aVHowever, grilled chicken poses a hidden danger.
p8
aVThe hidden danger is heterocyclic amines \u2014
p9
aVspecifically phenomethylimidazopyridine,
p10
aVor PhIP \u2014
p11
aV(laughter)
p12
aVwhich is the immunogenic or carcinogenic compound.
p13
aa(lp14
VA carcinogen is any substance or agent
p15
aVthat causes abnormal growth of cells,
p16
aVwhich can also cause them to metastasize or spread.
p17
aVThey are also organic compounds
p18
aVin which one or more of the hydrogens in ammonia
p19
aVis replaced with a more complex group.
p20
aVStudies show that antioxidants
p21
aVare known to decrease these heterocyclic amines.
p22
aVHowever, no studies exist yet
p23
aVthat show how or why.
p24
aVThese here are five different organizations that classify carcinogens.
p25
aVAnd as you can see, none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe,
p26
aVwhich justifies the need to decrease them in our diet.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow you might wonder how a 13 year-old girl could come up with this idea.
p29
aVAnd I was led to it through a series of events.
p30
aVI first learned about it through a lawsuit I read about in my doctor's office \u2014
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aVwhich was between the Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine
p33
aVand seven different fast food restaurants.
p34
aVThey weren't sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken,
p35
aVbut they were sued because of California's Proposition 65,
p36
aVwhich stated that if there's anything dangerous in the products
p37
aVthen the companies had to give a clear warning.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo I was very surprised about this.
p40
aVAnd I was wondering why nobody knew more
p41
aVabout this dangerous grilled chicken,
p42
aVwhich doesn't seem very harmful.
p43
aVBut then one night, my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner,
p44
aVand I noticed that the edges of the chicken,
p45
aVwhich had been marinated in lemon juice, turned white.
p46
aVAnd later in biology class, I learned that it's due to a process called denaturing,
p47
aVwhich is where the proteins will change shape
p48
aVand lose their ability to chemically function.
p49
aVSo I combined these two ideas and I formulated a hypothesis,
p50
aVsaying that, could possibly
p51
aVthe carcinogens be decreased due to a marinade
p52
aVand could it be due to the differences in PH?
p53
aa(lp54
VSo my idea was born,
p55
aVand I had the project set up and a hypothesis,
p56
aVso what was my next step?
p57
aVWell obviously I had to find a lab to work at
p58
aVbecause I didn't have the equipment in my school.
p59
aVI thought this would be easy,
p60
aVbut I emailed about 200 different people
p61
aVwithin a five-hour radius of where I lived,
p62
aVand I got one positive response that said that they could work with me.
p63
aVMost of the others either never responded back,
p64
aVsaid they didn't have the time
p65
aVor didn't have the equipment and couldn't help me.
p66
aVSo it was a big commitment
p67
aVto drive to the lab to work multiple times.
p68
aVHowever, it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab \u2014
p69
aVso I could finally start my project.
p70
aa(lp71
VThe first stage was completed at home,
p72
aVwhich consisted of marinating the chicken,
p73
aVgrilling the chicken, amassing it
p74
aVand preparing it to be transported to the lab.
p75
aVThe second stage was completed
p76
aVat the Penn State University main campus lab,
p77
aVwhich is where I extracted the chemicals,
p78
aVchanged the PH so I could run it through the equipment
p79
aVand separated the compounds I needed
p80
aVfrom the rest of the chicken.
p81
aVThe final stages, when I ran the samples
p82
aVthrough a high-pressure
p83
aVliquid chromatography mass spectrometer,
p84
aVwhich separated the compounds and analyzed the chemicals
p85
aVand told me exactly how much carcinogens I had
p86
aVin my chicken.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo when I went through the data, I had very surprising results,
p89
aVbecause I found that four out of the five marinating ingredients
p90
aVactually inhibited the carcinogen formation.
p91
aVWhen compared with the unmarinated chicken,
p92
aVwhich is what I used as my control,
p93
aVI found that lemon juice worked by far the best,
p94
aVwhich decreased the carcinogens
p95
aVby about 98 percent.
p96
aVThe saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade
p97
aValso worked very well,
p98
aVdecreasing the carcinogens by about 60 percent.
p99
aVOlive oil slightly decreased the PhIP formation,
p100
aVbut it was nearly negligible.
p101
aVAnd the soy sauce results were inconclusive
p102
aVbecause of the large data range,
p103
aVbut it seems like soy sauce
p104
aVactually increased the potential carcinogens.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnother important factor that I didn't take into account initially
p107
aVwas the time cooked.
p108
aVAnd I found that if you increase the time cooked,
p109
aVthe amount of carcinogens rapidly increases.
p110
aVSo the best way to marinate chicken, based on this,
p111
aVis to, not under-cook,
p112
aVbut definitely don't over-cook and char the chicken,
p113
aVand marinate in either lemon juice, brown sugar or saltwater.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Applause)
p116
aa(lp117
VBased on these findings, I have a question for you.
p118
aVWould you be willing to make a simple change in your diet
p119
aVthat could potentially save your life?
p120
aVNow I'm not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that's not marinated,
p121
aVyou're definitely going to catch cancer and die.
p122
aVHowever, anything you can do
p123
aVto decrease the risk of potential carcinogens
p124
aVcan definitely increase the quality of lifestyle.
p125
aa(lp126
VIs it worth it to you?
p127
aVHow will you cook your chicken now?
p128
aa(lp129
V(Applause)
p130
aa(lp131
VShree Bose: Hi everyone. I'm Shree Bose.
p132
aVI was the 17-18 year-old age category winner
p133
aVand then the grand prize winner.
p134
aVAnd I want all of you
p135
aVto imagine a little girl
p136
aVholding a dead blue spinach plant.
p137
aVAnd she's standing in front of you and she's explaining to you
p138
aVthat little kids will eat their vegetables
p139
aVif they're different colors.
p140
aVSounds ridiculous, right.
p141
aVBut that was me years ago.
p142
aVAnd that was my first science fair project.
p143
aVIt got a bit more complicated from there.
p144
aVMy older brother Panaki Bose
p145
aVspent hours of his time explaining atoms to me
p146
aVwhen I barely understood basic algebra.
p147
aVMy parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects,
p148
aVincluding a remote controlled garbage can.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd then came the summer after my freshman year,
p153
aVwhen my grandfather passed away due to cancer.
p154
aVAnd I remember watching my family go through that
p155
aVand thinking that I never wanted another family
p156
aVto feel that kind of loss.
p157
aVSo, armed with all the wisdom
p158
aVof freshman year biology,
p159
aVI decided I wanted to do cancer research
p160
aVat 15.
p161
aVGood plan.
p162
aVSo I started emailing all of these professors in my area
p163
aVasking to work under their supervision in a lab.
p164
aVGot rejected by all except one.
p165
aVAnd then went on, my next summer,
p166
aVto work under Dr. Basu
p167
aVat the UNT Health Center at Fort Worth, Texas.
p168
aVAnd that is where the research began.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo ovarian cancer
p171
aVis one of those cancers that most people don't know about,
p172
aVor at least don't pay that much attention to.
p173
aVBut yet, it's the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths
p174
aVamong women in the United States.
p175
aVIn fact, one in 70 women
p176
aVwill be diagnosed with ovarian cancer.
p177
aVOne in 100
p178
aVwill die from it.
p179
aVChemotherapy, one of the most effective ways
p180
aVused to treat cancer today,
p181
aVinvolves giving patients really high doses of chemicals
p182
aVto try and kill off cancer cells.
p183
aa(lp184
VCisplatin is a relatively common
p185
aVovarian cancer chemotherapy drug \u2014
p186
aVa relatively simple molecule made in the lab
p187
aVthat messes with the DNA of cancer cells
p188
aVand causes them to kill themselves.
p189
aVSounds great, right?
p190
aVBut here's the problem:
p191
aVsometimes patients become resistant to the drug,
p192
aVand then years after they've been declared to be cancer free,
p193
aVthey come back.
p194
aVAnd this time, they no longer respond to the drug.
p195
aVIt's a huge problem.
p196
aVIn fact, it's one of the biggest problems
p197
aVwith chemotherapy today.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo we wanted to figure out
p200
aVhow these ovarian cancer cells are becoming resistant
p201
aVto this drug called Cisplatin.
p202
aVAnd we wanted to figure this out,
p203
aVbecause if we could figure that out,
p204
aVthen we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening.
p205
aVSo that's what we set out to do.
p206
aVAnd we thought it had something to do with this protein called AMP kinase,
p207
aVan energy protein.
p208
aVSo we ran all of these tests blocking the protein,
p209
aVand we saw this huge shift.
p210
aVI mean, on the slide, you can see
p211
aVthat on our sensitive side,
p212
aVthese cells that are responding to the drug,
p213
aVwhen we start blocking the protein,
p214
aVthe number of dying cells \u2014 those colored dots \u2014
p215
aVthey're going down.
p216
aVBut then on this side, with the same treatment,
p217
aVthey're going up \u2014 interesting.
p218
aa(lp219
VBut those are dots on a screen for you;
p220
aVwhat exactly does that mean?
p221
aVWell basically that means
p222
aVthat this protein is changing
p223
aVfrom the sensitive cell to the resistant cell.
p224
aVAnd in fact, it might be changing the cells themselves
p225
aVto make the cells resistant.
p226
aVAnd that's huge.
p227
aVIn fact, it means that if a patient comes in
p228
aVand they're resistant to this drug,
p229
aVthen if we give them a chemical to block this protein,
p230
aVthen we can treat them again
p231
aVwith the same drug.
p232
aVAnd that's huge for chemotherapy effectiveness \u2014
p233
aVpossibly for many different types of cancer.
p234
aVSo that was my work,
p235
aVand it was my way of reimagining the future
p236
aVfor future research, with figuring out exactly what this protein does,
p237
aVbut also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness \u2014
p238
aVso maybe all grandfathers with cancer
p239
aVhave a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren.
p240
aa(lp241
VBut my work wasn't just about the research.
p242
aVIt was about finding my passion.
p243
aVThat's why being the grand prize winner
p244
aVof the Google Global Science Fair \u2014
p245
aVcute picture, right \u2014
p246
aVit was so exciting to me and it was such an amazing honor.
p247
aVAnd ever since then,
p248
aVI've gotten to do some pretty cool stuff \u2014
p249
aVfrom getting to meet the president
p250
aVto getting to be on this stage
p251
aVto talk to all of you guys.
p252
aa(lp253
VBut like I said, my journey wasn't just about the research,
p254
aVit was about finding my passion,
p255
aVand it was about making my own opportunities
p256
aVwhen I didn't even know what I was doing.
p257
aVIt was about inspiration
p258
aVand determination
p259
aVand never giving up on my interest
p260
aVfor science and learning and growing.
p261
aVAfter all, my story begins
p262
aVwith a dried, withered spinach plant
p263
aVand it's only getting better from there.
p264
aa(lp265
VThank you.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Applause)
p268
aa(lp269
VNaomi Shah: Hi everyone. I'm Naomi Shah,
p270
aVand today I'll be talking to you about my research
p271
aVinvolving indoor air quality
p272
aVand asthmatic patients.
p273
aV1.6 million deaths worldwide.
p274
aVOne death every 20 seconds.
p275
aVPeople spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors.
p276
aVAnd the economic burden of asthma
p277
aVexceeds that of HIV and tuberculosis combined.
p278
aVNow these statistics had a huge impact on me,
p279
aVbut what really sparked my interest in my research
p280
aVwas watching both my dad and my brother
p281
aVsuffer from chronic allergies year-round.
p282
aVIt confused me;
p283
aVwhy did these allergy symptoms persist
p284
aVwell past the pollen season?
p285
aa(lp286
VWith this question in mind, I started researching,
p287
aVand I soon found that indoor air pollutants were the culprit.
p288
aVAs soon as I realized this,
p289
aVI investigated the underlying relationship
p290
aVbetween four prevalent air pollutants
p291
aVand their affect on the lung health of asthmatic patients.
p292
aVAt first, I just wanted to figure out
p293
aVwhich of these four pollutants have the largest negative health impact
p294
aVon the lung health of asthmatic patients.
p295
aVBut soon after, I developed a novel mathematical model
p296
aVthat essentially quantifies the effect
p297
aVof these environmental pollutants
p298
aVon the lung health of asthmatic patients.
p299
aVAnd it surprises me
p300
aVthat no model currently exists
p301
aVthat quantifies the effect of environmental factors
p302
aVon human lung health,
p303
aVbecause that relationship seems so important.
p304
aa(lp305
VSo with that in mind,
p306
aVI started researching more, I started investigating more,
p307
aVand I became very passionate.
p308
aVBecause I realized
p309
aVthat if we could find a way to target remediation,
p310
aVwe could also find a way
p311
aVto treat asthmatic patients more effectively.
p312
aVFor example, volatile organic compounds
p313
aVare chemical pollutants
p314
aVthat are found in our schools, homes and workplaces.
p315
aVThey're everywhere.
p316
aVThese chemical pollutants
p317
aVare currently not a criteria air pollutant,
p318
aVas defined by the U.S. Clean Air Act.
p319
aVWhich is surprising to me,
p320
aVbecause these chemical pollutants, through my research,
p321
aVI show that they had a very large negative impact
p322
aVon the lung health of asthmatic patients
p323
aVand thus should be regulated.
p324
aa(lp325
VSo today I want to show you
p326
aVmy interactive software model that I created.
p327
aVI'm going to show it to you on my laptop.
p328
aVAnd I have a volunteer subject in the audience today,
p329
aVJulie.
p330
aVAnd all of Julie's data has been pre-entered
p331
aVinto my interactive software model.
p332
aVAnd this can be used by anyone.
p333
aVSo I want you to imagine that you're in Julie's shoes,
p334
aVor someone who's really close to you
p335
aVwho suffers from asthma or another lung disorder.
p336
aVSo Julie's going to her doctor's office
p337
aVto get treated for her asthma.
p338
aVAnd the doctor has her sit down,
p339
aVand he takes her peak expiratory flow rate \u2014
p340
aVwhich is essentially her exhalation rate,
p341
aVor the amount of air that she can breathe out in one breath.
p342
aa(lp343
VSo that peak expiratory flow rate,
p344
aVI've entered it up into the interactive software model.
p345
aVI've also entered in her age, her gender and her height.
p346
aVI've assumed that she lives in an average household
p347
aVwith average air pollutant levels.
p348
aVSo any user can come in here
p349
aVand click on "lung function report"
p350
aVand it'll take them to this report that I created.
p351
aVAnd this report really drives home the crux of my research.
p352
aa(lp353
VSo what it shows \u2014 if you want to focus on that top graph in the right-hand corner \u2014
p354
aVit shows Julie's actual peak expiratory flow rate
p355
aVin the yellow bar.
p356
aVThis is the measurement that she took in her doctor's office.
p357
aVIn the blue bar at the bottom of the graph,
p358
aVit shows what her peak expiratory flow rate,
p359
aVwhat her exhalation rate or lung health, should be
p360
aVbased on her age, gender and height.
p361
aVSo the doctor sees this difference between the yellow bar and the blue bar,
p362
aVand he says, "Wow, we need to give her steroids,
p363
aVmedication and inhalers."
p364
aa(lp365
VBut I want everyone here to reimagine a world
p366
aVwhere instead of prescribing steroids,
p367
aVinhalers and medication,
p368
aVthe doctor turns to Julie and says,
p369
aV"Why don't you go home and clean out your air filters.
p370
aVClean out the air ducts in your home,
p371
aVin your workplace, in your school.
p372
aVStop the use of incense and candles.
p373
aVAnd if you're remodeling your house,
p374
aVtake out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring."
p375
aVBecause these solutions are natural,
p376
aVthese solutions are sustainable,
p377
aVand these solutions are long-term investments \u2014
p378
aVlong-term investments that we're making
p379
aVfor our generation and for future generations.
p380
aVBecause these environmental solutions
p381
aVthat Julie can make in her home, her workplace and her school
p382
aVare impacting everyone that lives around her.
p383
aa(lp384
VSo I'm very passionate about this research
p385
aVand I really want to continue it
p386
aVand expand it to more disorders besides asthma,
p387
aVmore respiratory disorders, as well as more pollutants.
p388
aVBut before I end my talk today,
p389
aVI want to leave you with one saying.
p390
aVAnd that saying is that genetics loads the gun,
p391
aVbut the environment pulls the trigger.
p392
aVAnd that made a huge impact on me
p393
aVwhen I was doing this research.
p394
aVBecause what I feel, is a lot of us think
p395
aVthat the environment is at a macro level,
p396
aVthat we can't do anything to change our air quality
p397
aVor to change the climate or anything.
p398
aa(lp399
VBut if each one of us takes initiative in our own home,
p400
aVin our own school and in our own workplace,
p401
aVwe can make a huge difference in air quality.
p402
aVBecause remember, we spend 90 percent of our lives indoors.
p403
aVAnd air quality and air pollutants
p404
aVhave a huge impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients,
p405
aVanyone with a respiratory disorder
p406
aVand really all of us in general.
p407
aa(lp408
VSo I want you to reimagine a world
p409
aVwith better air quality,
p410
aVbetter quality of life
p411
aVand better quality of living for everyone
p412
aVincluding our future generations.
p413
aa(lp414
