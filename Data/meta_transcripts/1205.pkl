VFor a long time,
p4
aVthere was me, and my body.
p5
aVMe was composed of stories,
p6
aVof cravings, of strivings,
p7
aVof desires of the future.
p8
aVMe was trying
p9
aVnot to be an outcome of my violent past,
p10
aVbut the separation that had already occurred
p11
aVbetween me and my body
p12
aVwas a pretty significant outcome.
p13
aVMe was always trying to become something, somebody.
p14
aVMe only existed in the trying.
p15
aVMy body was often in the way.
p16
aa(lp17
VMe was a floating head.
p18
aVFor years, I actually only wore hats.
p19
aVIt was a way of keeping my head attached.
p20
aVIt was a way of locating myself.
p21
aVI worried that [if] I took my hat off
p22
aVI wouldn't be here anymore.
p23
aVI actually had a therapist who once said to me,
p24
aV"Eve, you've been coming here for two years,
p25
aVand, to be honest, it never occurred to me that you had a body."
p26
aVAll this time I lived in the city
p27
aVbecause, to be honest,
p28
aVI was afraid of trees.
p29
aVI never had babies
p30
aVbecause heads cannot give birth.
p31
aVBabies actually don't come out of your mouth.
p32
aa(lp33
VAs I had no reference point for my body,
p34
aVI began to ask other women about their bodies \u2014
p35
aVin particular, their vaginas,
p36
aVbecause I thought vaginas were kind of important.
p37
aVThis led to me writing "The Vagina Monologues,"
p38
aVwhich led to me obsessively and incessantly
p39
aVtalking about vaginas everywhere I could.
p40
aVI did this in front of many strangers.
p41
aVOne night on stage,
p42
aVI actually entered my vagina.
p43
aVIt was an ecstatic experience.
p44
aVIt scared me, it energized me,
p45
aVand then I became a driven person,
p46
aVa driven vagina.
p47
aa(lp48
VI began to see my body like a thing,
p49
aVa thing that could move fast,
p50
aVlike a thing that could accomplish other things,
p51
aVmany things, all at once.
p52
aVI began to see my body like an iPad or a car.
p53
aVI would drive it and demand things from it.
p54
aVIt had no limits. It was invincible.
p55
aVIt was to be conquered and mastered like the Earth herself.
p56
aVI didn't heed it;
p57
aVno, I organized it and I directed it.
p58
aVI didn't have patience for my body;
p59
aVI snapped it into shape.
p60
aVI was greedy.
p61
aVI took more than my body had to offer.
p62
aVIf I was tired, I drank more espressos.
p63
aVIf I was afraid, I went to more dangerous places.
p64
aa(lp65
VOh sure, sure, I had moments of appreciation of my body,
p66
aVthe way an abusive parent
p67
aVcan sometimes have a moment of kindness.
p68
aVMy father was really kind to me
p69
aVon my 16th birthday, for example.
p70
aVI heard people murmur from time to time
p71
aVthat I should love my body,
p72
aVso I learned how to do this.
p73
aVI was a vegetarian, I was sober, I didn't smoke.
p74
aVBut all that was just a more sophisticated way
p75
aVto manipulate my body \u2014
p76
aVa further disassociation,
p77
aVlike planting a vegetable field on a freeway.
p78
aa(lp79
VAs a result of me talking so much about my vagina,
p80
aVmany women started to tell me about theirs \u2014
p81
aVtheir stories about their bodies.
p82
aVActually, these stories compelled me around the world,
p83
aVand I've been to over 60 countries.
p84
aVI heard thousands of stories,
p85
aVand I have to tell you, there was always this moment
p86
aVwhere the women shared with me
p87
aVthat particular moment when she separated from her body \u2014
p88
aVwhen she left home.
p89
aVI heard about women being molested in their beds,
p90
aVflogged in their burqas,
p91
aVleft for dead in parking lots,
p92
aVacid burned in their kitchens.
p93
aVSome women became quiet and disappeared.
p94
aVOther women became mad, driven machines like me.
p95
aa(lp96
VIn the middle of my traveling,
p97
aVI turned 40 and I began to hate my body,
p98
aVwhich was actually progress,
p99
aVbecause at least my body existed enough to hate it.
p100
aVWell my stomach \u2014 it was my stomach I hated.
p101
aVIt was proof that I had not measured up,
p102
aVthat I was old and not fabulous and not perfect
p103
aVor able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape.
p104
aVMy stomach was proof that I had failed,
p105
aVthat it had failed me, that it was broken.
p106
aVMy life became about getting rid of it and obsessing about getting rid of it.
p107
aVIn fact, it became so extreme
p108
aVI wrote a play about it.
p109
aVBut the more I talked about it,
p110
aVthe more objectified and fragmented my body became.
p111
aVIt became entertainment; it became a new kind of commodity,
p112
aVsomething I was selling.
p113
aa(lp114
VThen I went somewhere else.
p115
aVI went outside
p116
aVwhat I thought I knew.
p117
aVI went to the Democratic Republic of Congo.
p118
aVAnd I heard stories
p119
aVthat shattered all the other stories.
p120
aVI heard stories
p121
aVthat got inside my body.
p122
aVI heard about a little girl
p123
aVwho couldn't stop peeing on herself
p124
aVbecause so many grown soldiers
p125
aVhad shoved themselves inside her.
p126
aVI heard an 80-year-old woman
p127
aVwhose legs were broken and pulled out of her sockets
p128
aVand twisted up on her head
p129
aVas the soldiers raped her like that.
p130
aVThere are thousands of these stories,
p131
aVand many of the women had holes in their bodies \u2014
p132
aVholes, fistula \u2014
p133
aVthat were the violation of war \u2014
p134
aVholes in the fabric of their souls.
p135
aVThese stories saturated my cells and nerves,
p136
aVand to be honest,
p137
aVI stopped sleeping for three years.
p138
aa(lp139
VAll the stories began to bleed together.
p140
aVThe raping of the Earth,
p141
aVthe pillaging of minerals,
p142
aVthe destruction of vaginas \u2014
p143
aVnone of these were separate anymore
p144
aVfrom each other or me.
p145
aVMilitias were raping six-month-old babies
p146
aVso that countries far away
p147
aVcould get access to gold and coltan
p148
aVfor their iPhones and computers.
p149
aVMy body had not only become a driven machine,
p150
aVbut it was responsible now
p151
aVfor destroying other women's bodies
p152
aVin its mad quest to make more machines
p153
aVto support the speed and efficiency of my machine.
p154
aa(lp155
VThen I got cancer \u2014
p156
aVor I found out I had cancer.
p157
aVIt arrived like a speeding bird
p158
aVsmashing into a windowpane.
p159
aVSuddenly, I had a body,
p160
aVa body that was pricked
p161
aVand poked and punctured,
p162
aVa body that was cut wide open,
p163
aVa body that had organs removed
p164
aVand transported and rearranged and reconstructed,
p165
aVa body that was scanned
p166
aVand had tubes shoved down it,
p167
aVa body that was burning from chemicals.
p168
aVCancer exploded
p169
aVthe wall of my disconnection.
p170
aVI suddenly understood that the crisis in my body
p171
aVwas the crisis in the world,
p172
aVand it wasn't happening later,
p173
aVit was happening now.
p174
aa(lp175
VSuddenly, my cancer was a cancer that was everywhere,
p176
aVthe cancer of cruelty, the cancer of greed,
p177
aVthe cancer that gets inside people
p178
aVwho live down the streets from chemical plants \u2014 and they're usually poor \u2014
p179
aVthe cancer inside the coal miner's lungs,
p180
aVthe cancer of stress for not achieving enough,
p181
aVthe cancer of buried trauma,
p182
aVthe cancer in caged chickens and polluted fish,
p183
aVthe cancer in women's uteruses from being raped,
p184
aVthe cancer that is everywhere from our carelessness.
p185
aa(lp186
VIn his new and visionary book,
p187
aV"New Self, New World,"
p188
aVthe writer Philip Shepherd says,
p189
aV"If you are divided from your body,
p190
aVyou are also divided from the body of the world,
p191
aVwhich then appears to be other than you
p192
aVor separate from you,
p193
aVrather than the living continuum
p194
aVto which you belong."
p195
aVBefore cancer,
p196
aVthe world was something other.
p197
aVIt was as if I was living in a stagnant pool
p198
aVand cancer dynamited the boulder
p199
aVthat was separating me from the larger sea.
p200
aVNow I am swimming in it.
p201
aVNow I lay down in the grass
p202
aVand I rub my body in it,
p203
aVand I love the mud on my legs and feet.
p204
aVNow I make a daily pilgrimage
p205
aVto visit a particular weeping willow by the Seine,
p206
aVand I hunger for the green fields
p207
aVin the bush outside Bukavu.
p208
aVAnd when it rains hard rain,
p209
aVI scream and I run in circles.
p210
aa(lp211
VI know that everything is connected,
p212
aVand the scar that runs the length of my torso
p213
aVis the markings of the earthquake.
p214
aVAnd I am there with the three million in the streets of Port-au-Prince.
p215
aVAnd the fire that burned in me
p216
aVon day three through six of chemo
p217
aVis the fire that is burning
p218
aVin the forests of the world.
p219
aVI know that the abscess
p220
aVthat grew around my wound after the operation,
p221
aVthe 16 ounces of puss,
p222
aVis the contaminated Gulf of Mexico,
p223
aVand there were oil-drenched pelicans inside me
p224
aVand dead floating fish.
p225
aVAnd the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication
p226
aVmade me scream out
p227
aVthe way the Earth cries out from the drilling.
p228
aa(lp229
VIn my second chemo,
p230
aVmy mother got very sick
p231
aVand I went to see her.
p232
aVAnd in the name of connectedness,
p233
aVthe only thing she wanted before she died
p234
aVwas to be brought home
p235
aVby her beloved Gulf of Mexico.
p236
aVSo we brought her home,
p237
aVand I prayed that the oil wouldn't wash up on her beach
p238
aVbefore she died.
p239
aVAnd gratefully, it didn't.
p240
aVAnd she died quietly in her favorite place.
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd a few weeks later, I was in New Orleans,
p243
aVand this beautiful, spiritual friend
p244
aVtold me she wanted to do a healing for me.
p245
aVAnd I was honored.
p246
aVAnd I went to her house, and it was morning,
p247
aVand the morning New Orleans sun was filtering through the curtains.
p248
aVAnd my friend was preparing this big bowl,
p249
aVand I said, "What is it?"
p250
aVAnd she said, "It's for you.
p251
aVThe flowers make it beautiful,
p252
aVand the honey makes it sweet."
p253
aVAnd I said, "But what's the water part?"
p254
aVAnd in the name of connectedness,
p255
aVshe said, "Oh, it's the Gulf of Mexico."
p256
aVAnd I said, "Of course it is."
p257
aVAnd the other women arrived and they sat in a circle,
p258
aVand Michaela bathed my head with the sacred water.
p259
aVAnd she sang \u2014 I mean her whole body sang.
p260
aVAnd the other women sang
p261
aVand they prayed for me and my mother.
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd as the warm Gulf washed over my naked head,
p264
aVI realized that it held
p265
aVthe best and the worst of us.
p266
aVIt was the greed and recklessness
p267
aVthat led to the drilling explosion.
p268
aVIt was all the lies that got told
p269
aVbefore and after.
p270
aVIt was the honey in the water that made it sweet,
p271
aVit was the oil that made it sick.
p272
aVIt was my head that was bald \u2014
p273
aVand comfortable now without a hat.
p274
aVIt was my whole self
p275
aVmelting into Michaela's lap.
p276
aVIt was the tears that were indistinguishable from the Gulf
p277
aVthat were falling down my cheek.
p278
aVIt was finally being in my body.
p279
aVIt was the sorrow
p280
aVthat's taken so long.
p281
aVIt was finding my place
p282
aVand the huge responsibility
p283
aVthat comes with connection.
p284
aVIt was the continuing devastating war in the Congo
p285
aVand the indifference of the world.
p286
aVIt was the Congolese women
p287
aVwho are now rising up.
p288
aVIt was my mother leaving,
p289
aVjust at the moment
p290
aVthat I was being born.
p291
aVIt was the realization
p292
aVthat I had come very close to dying \u2014
p293
aVin the same way that the Earth, our mother,
p294
aVis barely holding on,
p295
aVin the same way that 75 percent of the planet
p296
aVare hardly scraping by,
p297
aVin the same way
p298
aVthat there is a recipe for survival.
p299
aa(lp300
VWhat I learned
p301
aVis it has to do with attention and resources
p302
aVthat everybody deserves.
p303
aVIt was advocating friends
p304
aVand a doting sister.
p305
aVIt was wise doctors and advanced medicine
p306
aVand surgeons who knew what to do with their hands.
p307
aVIt was underpaid and really loving nurses.
p308
aVIt was magic healers and aromatic oils.
p309
aVIt was people who came with spells and rituals.
p310
aVIt was having a vision of the future
p311
aVand something to fight for,
p312
aVbecause I know this struggle isn't my own.
p313
aVIt was a million prayers.
p314
aVIt was a thousand hallelujahs
p315
aVand a million oms.
p316
aVIt was a lot of anger,
p317
aVinsane humor,
p318
aVa lot of attention, outrage.
p319
aVIt was energy, love and joy.
p320
aVIt was all these things.
p321
aVIt was all these things.
p322
aVIt was all these things
p323
aVin the water, in the world, in my body.
