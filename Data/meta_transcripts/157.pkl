(lp3
VI really am honored to be here, and as Chris said,
p4
aVit's been over 20 years since I started working in Africa.
p5
aVMy first introduction was at the Abidjan airport on a sweaty, Ivory Coast morning.
p6
aVI had just left Wall Street, cut my hair to look like Margaret Mead,
p7
aVgiven away most everything that I owned,
p8
aVand arrived with all the essentials \u2014
p9
aVsome poetry, a few clothes, and, of course, a guitar \u2014
p10
aVbecause I was going to save the world,
p11
aVand I thought I would just start with the African continent.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut literally within days of arriving I was told, in no uncertain terms,
p14
aVby a number of West African women, that Africans didn't want saving,
p15
aVthank you very much, least of all not by me.
p16
aVI was too young, unmarried, I had no children,
p17
aVdidn't really know Africa, and besides, my French was pitiful.
p18
aVAnd so, it was an incredibly painful time in my life,
p19
aVand yet it really started to give me the humility to start listening.
p20
aa(lp21
VI think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well,
p22
aVso I moved to Kenya and worked in Uganda,
p23
aVand I met a group of Rwandan women, who asked me, in 1986,
p24
aVto move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there.
p25
aVAnd I did, and we ended up naming it Duterimbere,
p26
aVmeaning "to go forward with enthusiasm." And while we were doing it,
p27
aVI realized that there weren't a lot of businesses that were viable
p28
aVand started by women, and so maybe I should try to run a business, too.
p29
aVAnd so I started looking around, and I heard about a bakery
p30
aVthat was run by 20 prostitutes.
p31
aVAnd, being a little intrigued, I went to go meet this group,
p32
aVand what I found was 20 unwed mothers who were trying to survive.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language,
p35
aVand how what we call people so often distances us from them,
p36
aVand makes them little.
p37
aVI also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business,
p38
aVthat, in fact, it was a classic charity run by a well-intentioned person,
p39
aVwho essentially spent 600 dollars a month
p40
aVto keep these 20 women busy making little crafts and baked goods,
p41
aVand living on 50 cents a day, still in poverty.
p42
aVSo, I made a deal with the women. I said, "Look, we get rid of the charity side,
p43
aVand we run this as a business and I'll help you."
p44
aVThey nervously agreed. I nervously started, and, of course,
p45
aVthings are always harder than you think they're going to be.
p46
aa(lp47
VFirst of all, I thought, well, we need a sales team,
p48
aVand we clearly aren't the A-Team here,
p49
aVso let's \u2014 I did all this training.
p50
aVAnd the epitome was when I literally marched into the streets
p51
aVof Nyamirambo, which is the popular quarter of Kigali, with a bucket,
p52
aVand I sold all these little doughnuts to people,
p53
aVand I came back, and I was like, "You see?"
p54
aVAnd the women said, "You know, Jacqueline, who in Nyamirambo is not going to buy
p55
aVdoughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall American woman?" And like \u2014
p56
aV(Laughter) \u2014 it's a good point.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo then I went the whole American way,
p59
aVwith competitions, team and individual. Completely failed,
p60
aVbut over time, the women learnt to sell on their own way.
p61
aVAnd they started listening to the marketplace,
p62
aVand they came back with ideas for cassava chips, and banana chips,
p63
aVand sorghum bread, and before you knew it,
p64
aVwe had cornered the Kigali market,
p65
aVand the women were earning three to four times the national average.
p66
aVAnd with that confidence surge, I thought, "Well, it's time to create a real bakery,
p67
aVso let's paint it." And the women said, "That's a really great idea."
p68
aVAnd I said, "Well, what color do you want to paint it?" And they said,
p69
aV"Well, you choose." And I said, "No, no, I'm learning to listen.
p70
aVYou choose. It's your bakery, your street, your country \u2014 not mine."
p71
aVBut they wouldn't give me an answer.
p72
aVSo, one week, two weeks, three weeks went by,
p73
aVand finally I said, "Well, how about blue?"
p74
aVAnd they said, "Blue, blue, we love blue. Let's do it blue."
p75
aVSo, I went to the store, I brought Gaudence, the recalcitrant one of all,
p76
aVand we brought all this paint and fabric to make curtains,
p77
aVand on painting day, we all gathered in Nyamirambo,
p78
aVand the idea was we would paint it white with blue as trim,
p79
aVlike a little French bakery. But that was clearly not as satisfying
p80
aVas painting a wall of blue like a morning sky.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo, blue, blue, everything became blue.
p83
aVThe walls were blue, the windows were blue,
p84
aVthe sidewalk out front was painted blue.
p85
aVAnd Aretha Franklin was shouting "R-E-S-P-E-C-T,"
p86
aVthe women's hips were swaying
p87
aVand little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes, but it was their day.
p88
aVAnd at the end of it, we stood across the street
p89
aVand we looked at what we had done, and I said, "It is so beautiful."
p90
aVAnd the women said, "It really is."
p91
aVAnd I said, "And I think the color is perfect,"
p92
aVand they all nodded their head, except for Gaudence,
p93
aVand I said, "What?"
p94
aVAnd she said, "Nothing." And I said, "What?"
p95
aVAnd she said, "Well, it is pretty, but, you know, our color, really, it is green." And \u2014
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
V\u2014 I learned then that listening isn't just about patience,
p99
aVbut that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long,
p100
aVit's really hard to say what you mean.
p101
aVAnd, mostly because people never really ask you,
p102
aVand when they do, you don't really think they want to know the truth.
p103
aVAnd so then I learned that listening is not only about waiting,
p104
aVbut it's also learning how better to ask questions.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd so, I lived in Kigali for about two and a half years, doing these two things,
p107
aVand it was an extraordinary time in my life.
p108
aVAnd it taught me three lessons
p109
aVthat I think are so important for us today,
p110
aVand certainly in the work that I do.
p111
aVThe first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.
p112
aVAs Eleni has said, when people gain income, they gain choice,
p113
aVand that is fundamental to dignity.
p114
aVBut as human beings, we also want to see each other,
p115
aVand we want to be heard by each other, and we should never forget that.
p116
aVThe second is that traditional charity and aid
p117
aVare never going to solve the problems of poverty.
p118
aa(lp119
VI think Andrew pretty well covered that, so I will move to the third point,
p120
aVwhich is that markets alone also
p121
aVare not going to solve the problems of poverty.
p122
aVYes, we ran this as a business,
p123
aVbut someone needed to pay the philanthropic support
p124
aVthat came into the training, and the management support, the strategic advice
p125
aVand, maybe most important of all,
p126
aVthe access to new contacts, networks and new markets.
p127
aVAnd so, on a micro level, there's a real role for this combination
p128
aVof investment and philanthropy.
p129
aVAnd on a macro level \u2014 some of the speakers have inferred that
p130
aVeven health should be privatized.
p131
aVBut, having had a father with heart disease,
p132
aVand realizing that what our family could afford
p133
aVwas not what he should have gotten,
p134
aVand having a good friend step in to help,
p135
aVI really believe that all people deserve access to health
p136
aVat prices they can afford.
p137
aVI think the market can help us figure that out,
p138
aVbut there's got to be a charitable component,
p139
aVor I don't think we're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in.
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd so, it was really those lessons that made me decide to
p142
aVbuild Acumen Fund about six years ago.
p143
aVIt's a nonprofit, venture capital fund for the poor,
p144
aVa few oxymorons in one sentence.
p145
aVIt essentially raises charitable funds from individuals, foundations and corporations,
p146
aVand then we turn around and we invest equity and loans
p147
aVin both for-profit and nonprofit entities
p148
aVthat deliver affordable health, housing, energy, clean water
p149
aVto low income people in South Asia and Africa,
p150
aVso that they can make their own choices.
p151
aVWe've invested about 20 million dollars in 20 different enterprises,
p152
aVand have, in so doing, created nearly 20,000 jobs,
p153
aVand delivered tens of millions of services to people
p154
aVwho otherwise would not be able to afford them.
p155
aa(lp156
VI want to tell you two stories. Both of them are in Africa.
p157
aVBoth of them are about investing in entrepreneurs
p158
aVwho are committed to service, and who really know the markets.
p159
aVBoth of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise,
p160
aVand both of them, because they're manufacturers,
p161
aVcreate jobs directly, and create incomes indirectly,
p162
aVbecause they're in the malaria sector,
p163
aVand Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria.
p164
aVAnd so as people get healthier, they also get wealthier.
p165
aa(lp166
VThe first one is called Advanced Bio-Extracts Limited.
p167
aVIt's a company built in Kenya about seven years ago
p168
aVby an incredible entrepreneur named Patrick Henfrey and his three colleagues.
p169
aVThese are old-hand farmers
p170
aVwho've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs
p171
aVin Kenya over the last 30 years.
p172
aVNow, this plant is an Artemisia plant;
p173
aVit's the basic component for artemisinin,
p174
aVwhich is the best-known treatment for malaria.
p175
aVIt's indigenous to China and the Far East,
p176
aVbut given that the prevalence of malaria is here in Africa,
p177
aVPatrick and his colleagues said, "Let's bring it here,
p178
aVbecause it's a high value-add product."
p179
aVThe farmers get three to four times the yields that they would with maize.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd so, using patient capital \u2014 money that they could raise early on,
p182
aVthat actually got below market returns
p183
aVand was willing to go the long haul and be combined
p184
aVwith management assistance, strategic assistance \u2014
p185
aVthey've now created a company where they purchase from 7,500 farmers.
p186
aVSo that's about 50,000 people affected.
p187
aVAnd I think some of you may have visited \u2014
p188
aVthese farmers are helped by KickStart and TechnoServe,
p189
aVwho help them become more self-sufficient.
p190
aVThey buy it, they dry it and they bring it to this factory,
p191
aVwhich was purchased in part by, again, patient capital from Novartis,
p192
aVwho has a real interest in getting the powder
p193
aVso that they can make Coartem.
p194
aVAcumen's been working with ABE for the past year, year and a half,
p195
aVboth on looking at a new business plan,
p196
aVand what does expansion look like, helping with management support
p197
aVand helping to do term sheets and raise capital.
p198
aVAnd I really understood what patient capital meant emotionally
p199
aVin the last month or so. Because the company was literally
p200
aV10 days away from proving that the product they produced
p201
aVwas at the world-quality level needed to make Coartem,
p202
aVwhen they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd we called all of the social investors we know.
p205
aVNow, some of these same social investors are really interested in Africa
p206
aVand understand the importance of agriculture,
p207
aVand they even helped the farmers.
p208
aVAnd even when we explained that if ABE goes away,
p209
aVall those 7,500 jobs go away too,
p210
aVwe sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social.
p211
aVAnd it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused.
p212
aVSo Acumen made not one, but two bridge loans,
p213
aVand the good news is they did indeed meet world-quality classification and are now
p214
aVin the final stages of closing a 20-million-dollar round, to move it to the next level,
p215
aVand I think that this will be one of the more important companies in East Africa.
p216
aa(lp217
VThis is Samuel. He's a farmer.
p218
aVHe was actually living in the Kibera slums
p219
aVwhen his father called him and told him about Artemisia and the value-add potential.
p220
aVSo he moved back to the farm, and, long story short,
p221
aVthey now have seven acres under cultivation.
p222
aVSamuel's kids are in private school,
p223
aVand he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into Artemisia production \u2014
p224
aVdignity being more important than wealth.
p225
aa(lp226
VThe next one, many of you know.
p227
aVI talked about it a little at Oxford two years ago,
p228
aVand some of you visited A to Z manufacturing,
p229
aVwhich is one of the great, real companies in East Africa.
p230
aVIt's another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise.
p231
aVAnd this is really a story about a public-private solution
p232
aVthat has really worked.
p233
aVIt started in Japan. Sumitomo had developed a technology
p234
aVessentially to impregnate a polyethylene-based fiber with organic insecticide,
p235
aVso you could create a bed net,
p236
aVa malaria bed net, that would last five years and not need to be re-dipped.
p237
aa(lp238
VIt could alter the vector, but like Artemisia,
p239
aVit had been produced only in East Asia. And as part of its social responsibility,
p240
aVSumitomo said, "Why don't we experiment
p241
aVwith whether we can produce it in Africa, for Africans?"
p242
aVUNICEF came forward and said, "We'll buy most of the nets,
p243
aVand then we'll give them away, as part of the global fund's
p244
aVand the U.N.'s commitment to pregnant women and children, for free."
p245
aVAcumen came in with the patient capital,
p246
aVand we also helped to identify the entrepreneur
p247
aVthat we would all partner with here in Africa,
p248
aVand Exxon provided the initial resin.
p249
aa(lp250
VWell, in looking around for entrepreneurs,
p251
aVthere was none better that we could find on earth than Anuj Shah,
p252
aVin A to Z manufacturing company.
p253
aVIt's a 40-year-old company, it understands manufacturing.
p254
aVIt's gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania,
p255
aVand continued to flourish. It had about 1,000 employees when we first found it.
p256
aVAnd so, Anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in Africa
p257
aVto produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment
p258
aVto work with malaria.
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd, long story short, again, they've been so successful.
p261
aVIn our first year, the first net went off the line in October of 2003.
p262
aVWe thought the hitting-it-out-of-the-box number was 150,000 nets a year.
p263
aVThis year, they are now producing eight million nets a year,
p264
aVand they employ 5,000 people, 90 percent of whom are women, mostly unskilled.
p265
aVThey're in a joint venture with Sumitomo.
p266
aVAnd so, from an enterprise perspective for Africa,
p267
aVand from a public health perspective, these are real successes.
p268
aa(lp269
VBut it's only half the story if we're really looking at solving problems of poverty,
p270
aVbecause it's not long-term sustainable.
p271
aVIt's a company with one big customer.
p272
aVAnd if avian flu hits, or for any other reason
p273
aVthe world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority, everybody loses.
p274
aVAnd so, Anuj and Acumen
p275
aVhave been talking about testing the private sector,
p276
aVbecause the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that,
p277
aVlook, in a country like Tanzania,
p278
aV80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day.
p279
aVIt costs, at manufacturing point, six dollars to produce these,
p280
aVand it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it,
p281
aVso the market price in a free market would be about 12 dollars per net.
p282
aVMost people can't afford that, so let's give it away free.
p283
aVAnd we said, "Well, there's another option.
p284
aVLet's use the market as the best listening device we have, and
p285
aVunderstand at what price people would pay for this, so they get the dignity of choice.
p286
aVWe can start building local distribution,
p287
aVand actually, it can cost the public sector much less."
p288
aa(lp289
VAnd so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z,
p290
aVa loan as well as a grant, so that A to Z could play with pricing
p291
aVand listen to the marketplace, and found a number of things.
p292
aVOne, that people will pay different prices,
p293
aVbut the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net
p294
aVand make a decision to buy it.
p295
aVAnd when you listen to them, they'll also have a lot to say
p296
aVabout what they like and what they don't like.
p297
aVAnd that some of the channels we thought would work didn't work.
p298
aVBut because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed
p299
aVbecause of the patient capital,
p300
aVwe've now found that it costs about a dollar in the private sector
p301
aVto distribute, and a dollar to buy the net.
p302
aVSo then, from a policy perspective, when you start with the market,
p303
aVwe have a choice.
p304
aVWe can continue going along at 12 dollars a net, and the customer pays zero,
p305
aVor we could at least experiment with some of it, to charge one dollar a net,
p306
aVcosting the public sector another six dollars a net,
p307
aVgive the people the dignity of choice, and have a distribution system
p308
aVthat might, over time, start sustaining itself.
p309
aa(lp310
VWe've got to start having conversations like this,
p311
aVand I don't think there's any better way to start than using the market,
p312
aVbut also to bring other people to the table around it.
p313
aVWhenever I go to visit A to Z, I think of my grandmother, Stella.
p314
aVShe was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines.
p315
aVShe grew up on a farm in Austria, very poor,
p316
aVdidn't have very much education.
p317
aVShe moved to the United States, where she met my grandfather,
p318
aVwho was a cement hauler,
p319
aVand they had nine children. Three of them died as babies.
p320
aVMy grandmother had tuberculosis, and she worked in a sewing machine shop,
p321
aVmaking shirts for about 10 cents an hour.
p322
aVShe, like so many of the women I see at A to Z,
p323
aVworked hard every day, understood what suffering was,
p324
aVhad a deep faith in God, loved her children
p325
aVand would never have accepted a handout.
p326
aVBut because she had the opportunity of the marketplace,
p327
aVand she lived in a society that provided the safety
p328
aVof having access to affordable health and education,
p329
aVher children and their children were able to live
p330
aVlives of real purpose and follow real dreams.
p331
aa(lp332
VI look around at my siblings and my cousins \u2014 and as I said,
p333
aVthere are a lot of us \u2014
p334
aVand I see teachers and musicians, hedge fund managers, designers.
p335
aVOne sister who makes other people's wishes come true.
p336
aVAnd my wish, when I see those women, I meet those farmers,
p337
aVand I think about all the people across this continent
p338
aVwho are working hard every day,
p339
aVis that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility,
p340
aVand that they also can believe and get access to services,
p341
aVso that their children, too, can live those lives of great purpose.
p342
aVIt shouldn't be that difficult.
p343
aVBut what it takes is a commitment from all of us
p344
aVto essentially refuse trite assumptions,
p345
aVget out of our ideological boxes.
p346
aVIt takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed
p347
aVto service as well as to success.
p348
aVIt takes opening your arms, both, wide,
p349
aVand expecting very little love in return,
p350
aVbut demanding accountability,
p351
aVand bringing the accountability to the table as well.
p352
aVAnd most of all, most of all,
p353
aVit requires that all of us have the courage and the patience,
p354
aVwhether we are rich or poor, African or non-African,
p355
aVlocal or diaspora, left or right,
p356
aVto really start listening to each other.
p357
aVThank you.
