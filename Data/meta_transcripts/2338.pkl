VImagine being unable to say, "I am hungry," "I am in pain,"
p4
aV"thank you," or "I love you."
p5
aVBeing trapped inside your body,
p6
aVa body that doesn't respond to commands.
p7
aVSurrounded by people,
p8
aVyet utterly alone.
p9
aVWishing you could reach out,
p10
aVto connect, to comfort, to participate.
p11
aVFor 13 long years, that was my reality.
p12
aa(lp13
VMost of us never think twice about talking, about communicating.
p14
aVI've thought a lot about it.
p15
aVI've had a lot of time to think.
p16
aa(lp17
VFor the first 12 years of my life,
p18
aVI was a normal, happy, healthy little boy.
p19
aVThen everything changed.
p20
aVI contracted a brain infection.
p21
aVThe doctors weren't sure what it was,
p22
aVbut they treated me the best they could.
p23
aVHowever, I progressively got worse.
p24
aVEventually, I lost my ability to control my movements,
p25
aVmake eye contact,
p26
aVand finally, my ability to speak.
p27
aa(lp28
VWhile in hospital,
p29
aVI desperately wanted to go home.
p30
aVI said to my mother, "When home?"
p31
aVThose were the last words I ever spoke with my own voice.
p32
aVI would eventually fail every test for mental awareness.
p33
aVMy parents were told I was as good as not there.
p34
aVA vegetable, having the intelligence of a three-month-old baby.
p35
aVThey were told to take me home and try to keep me comfortable
p36
aVuntil I died.
p37
aa(lp38
VMy parents, in fact my entire family's lives,
p39
aVbecame consumed by taking care of me the best they knew how.
p40
aVTheir friends drifted away.
p41
aVOne year turned to two,
p42
aVtwo turned to three.
p43
aVIt seemed like the person I once was began to disappear.
p44
aVThe Lego blocks and electronic circuits I'd loved as a boy were put away.
p45
aVI had been moved out of my bedroom into another more practical one.
p46
aVI had become a ghost,
p47
aVa faded memory of a boy people once knew and loved.
p48
aa(lp49
VMeanwhile, my mind began knitting itself back together.
p50
aVGradually, my awareness started to return.
p51
aVBut no one realized that I had come back to life.
p52
aVI was aware of everything,
p53
aVjust like any normal person.
p54
aVI could see and understand everything,
p55
aVbut I couldn't find a way to let anybody know.
p56
aVMy personality was entombed within a seemingly silent body,
p57
aVa vibrant mind hidden in plain sight within a chrysalis.
p58
aa(lp59
VThe stark reality hit me that I was going to spend
p60
aVthe rest of my life locked inside myself,
p61
aVtotally alone.
p62
aVI was trapped with only my thoughts for company.
p63
aVI would never be rescued.
p64
aVNo one would ever show me tenderness.
p65
aVI would never talk to a friend.
p66
aVNo one would ever love me.
p67
aVI had no dreams, no hope, nothing to look forward to.
p68
aVWell, nothing pleasant.
p69
aVI lived in fear,
p70
aVand, to put it bluntly,
p71
aVwas waiting for death to finally release me,
p72
aVexpecting to die all alone in a care home.
p73
aa(lp74
VI don't know if it's truly possible to express in words
p75
aVwhat it's like not to be able to communicate.
p76
aVYour personality appears to vanish into a heavy fog
p77
aVand all of your emotions and desires are constricted, stifled and muted within you.
p78
aVFor me, the worst was the feeling of utter powerlessness.
p79
aVI simply existed.
p80
aVIt's a very dark place to find yourself
p81
aVbecause in a sense, you have vanished.
p82
aVOther people controlled every aspect of my life.
p83
aVThey decided what I ate and when.
p84
aVWhether I was laid on my side or strapped into my wheelchair.
p85
aVI often spent my days positioned in front of the TV
p86
aVwatching Barney reruns.
p87
aVI think because Barney is so happy and jolly,
p88
aVand I absolutely wasn't,
p89
aVit made it so much worse.
p90
aa(lp91
VI was completely powerless to change anything in my life
p92
aVor people's perceptions of me.
p93
aVI was a silent, invisible observer of how people behaved
p94
aVwhen they thought no one was watching.
p95
aVUnfortunately, I wasn't only an observer.
p96
aVWith no way to communicate, I became the perfect victim:
p97
aVa defenseless object, seemingly devoid of feelings
p98
aVthat people used to play out their darkest desires.
p99
aVFor more than 10 years, people who were charged with my care
p100
aVabused me physically, verbally and sexually.
p101
aVDespite what they thought, I did feel.
p102
aVThe first time it happened,
p103
aVI was shocked and filled with disbelief.
p104
aVHow could they do this to me?
p105
aVI was confused.
p106
aVWhat had I done to deserve this?
p107
aVPart of me wanted to cry and another part wanted to fight.
p108
aVHurt, sadness and anger flooded through me.
p109
aVI felt worthless.
p110
aVThere was no one to comfort me.
p111
aVBut neither of my parents knew this was happening.
p112
aVI lived in terror, knowing it would happen again and again.
p113
aVI just never knew when.
p114
aVAll I knew was that I would never be the same.
p115
aVI remember once listening to Whitney Houston singing,
p116
aV"No matter what they take from me, they can't take away my dignity."
p117
aVAnd I thought to myself, "You want to bet?"
p118
aa(lp119
VPerhaps my parents could have found out and could have helped.
p120
aVBut the years of constant caretaking,
p121
aVhaving to wake up every two hours to turn me,
p122
aVcombined with them essentially grieving the loss of their son,
p123
aVhad taken a toll on my mother and father.
p124
aVFollowing yet another heated argument between my parents,
p125
aVin a moment of despair and desperation,
p126
aVmy mother turned to me and told me that I should die.
p127
aVI was shocked, but as I thought about what she had said,
p128
aVI was filled with enormous compassion and love for my mother,
p129
aVyet I could do nothing about it.
p130
aa(lp131
VThere were many moments when I gave up,
p132
aVsinking into a dark abyss.
p133
aVI remember one particularly low moment.
p134
aVMy dad left me alone in the car
p135
aVwhile he quickly went to buy something from the store.
p136
aVA random stranger walked past,
p137
aVlooked at me and he smiled.
p138
aVI may never know why, but that simple act,
p139
aVthe fleeting moment of human connection,
p140
aVtransformed how I was feeling,
p141
aVmaking me want to keep going.
p142
aa(lp143
VMy existence was tortured by monotony,
p144
aVa reality that was often too much to bear.
p145
aVAlone with my thoughts, I constructed intricate fantasies
p146
aVabout ants running across the floor.
p147
aVI taught myself to tell the time by noticing where the shadows were.
p148
aVAs I learned how the shadows moved as the hours of the day passed,
p149
aVI understood how long it would be before I was picked up and taken home.
p150
aVSeeing my father walk through the door to collect me
p151
aVwas the best moment of the day.
p152
aa(lp153
VMy mind became a tool that I could use
p154
aVto either close down to retreat from my reality
p155
aVor enlarge into a gigantic space that I could fill with fantasies.
p156
aVI hoped that my reality would change
p157
aVand someone would see that I had come back to life.
p158
aVBut I had been washed away like a sand castle
p159
aVbuilt too close to the waves,
p160
aVand in my place was the person people expected me to be.
p161
aVTo some I was Martin, a vacant shell, the vegetable,
p162
aVdeserving of harsh words, dismissal and even abuse.
p163
aVTo others, I was the tragically brain-damaged boy
p164
aVwho had grown to become a man.
p165
aVSomeone they were kind to and cared for.
p166
aVGood or bad, I was a blank canvas
p167
aVonto which different versions of myself were projected.
p168
aa(lp169
VIt took someone new to see me in a different way.
p170
aVAn aromatherapist began coming to the care home about once a week.
p171
aVWhether through intuition or her attention to details
p172
aVthat others failed to notice,
p173
aVshe became convinced that I could understand what was being said.
p174
aVShe urged my parents to have me tested by experts
p175
aVin augmentative and alternative communication.
p176
aVAnd within a year,
p177
aVI was beginning to use a computer program to communicate.
p178
aVIt was exhilarating, but frustrating at times.
p179
aVI had so many words in my mind,
p180
aVthat I couldn't wait to be able to share them.
p181
aVSometimes, I would say things to myself simply because I could.
p182
aVIn myself, I had a ready audience,
p183
aVand I believed that by expressing my thoughts and wishes,
p184
aVothers would listen, too.
p185
aa(lp186
VBut as I began to communicate more,
p187
aVI realized that it was in fact only just the beginning
p188
aVof creating a new voice for myself.
p189
aVI was thrust into a world I didn't quite know how to function in.
p190
aVI stopped going to the care home
p191
aVand managed to get my first job making photocopies.
p192
aVAs simple as this may sound, it was amazing.
p193
aVMy new world was really exciting
p194
aVbut often quite overwhelming and frightening.
p195
aVI was like a man-child,
p196
aVand as liberating as it often was,
p197
aVI struggled.
p198
aVI also learned that many of those who had known me for a long time
p199
aVfound it impossible to abandon the idea of Martin they had in their heads.
p200
aVWhile those I had only just met
p201
aVstruggled to look past the image of a silent man in a wheelchair.
p202
aVI realized that some people would only listen to me
p203
aVif what I said was in line with what they expected.
p204
aVOtherwise, it was disregarded
p205
aVand they did what they felt was best.
p206
aa(lp207
VI discovered that true communication
p208
aVis about more than merely physically conveying a message.
p209
aVIt is about getting the message heard and respected.
p210
aVStill, things were going well.
p211
aVMy body was slowly getting stronger.
p212
aVI had a job in computing that I loved,
p213
aVand had even got Kojak, the dog I had been dreaming about for years.
p214
aa(lp215
VHowever, I longed to share my life with someone.
p216
aVI remember staring out the window as my dad drove me home from work,
p217
aVthinking I have so much love inside of me and nobody to give it to.
p218
aVJust as I had resigned myself to being single for the rest of my life,
p219
aVI met Joan.
p220
aVNot only is she the best thing that has ever happened to me,
p221
aVbut Joan helped me to challenge my own misconceptions about myself.
p222
aVJoan said it was through my words that she fell in love with me.
p223
aVHowever, after all I had been through,
p224
aVI still couldn't shake the belief
p225
aVthat nobody could truly see beyond my disability
p226
aVand accept me for who I am.
p227
aa(lp228
VI also really struggled to comprehend that I was a man.
p229
aVThe first time someone referred to me as a man,
p230
aVit stopped me in my tracks.
p231
aVI felt like looking around and asking, "Who, me?"
p232
aVThat all changed with Joan.
p233
aVWe have an amazing connection
p234
aVand I learned how important it is to communicate openly and honestly.
p235
aVI felt safe, and it gave me the confidence to truly say what I thought.
p236
aVI started to feel whole again, a man worthy of love.
p237
aa(lp238
VI began to reshape my destiny.
p239
aVI spoke up a little more at work.
p240
aVI asserted my need for independence to the people around me.
p241
aVBeing given a means of communication changed everything.
p242
aVI used the power of words and will to challenge the preconceptions
p243
aVof those around me and those I had of myself.
p244
aa(lp245
VCommunication is what makes us human,
p246
aVenabling us to connect on the deepest level
p247
aVwith those around us \u2014
p248
aVtelling our own stories,
p249
aVexpressing wants, needs and desires,
p250
aVor hearing those of others by really listening.
p251
aVAll this is how the world knows who we are.
p252
aVSo who are we without it?
p253
aa(lp254
VTrue communication increases understanding
p255
aVand creates a more caring and compassionate world.
p256
aVOnce, I was perceived to be an inanimate object,
p257
aVa mindless phantom of a boy in a wheelchair.
p258
aVToday, I am so much more.
p259
aVA husband, a son, a friend,
p260
aVa brother, a business owner, a first-class honors graduate,
p261
aVa keen amateur photographer.
p262
aVIt is my ability to communicate that has given me all this.
p263
aa(lp264
VWe are told that actions speak louder than words.
p265
aVBut I wonder,
p266
aVdo they?
p267
aVOur words, however we communicate them,
p268
aVare just as powerful.
p269
aVWhether we speak the words with our own voices,
p270
aVtype them with our eyes,
p271
aVor communicate them non-verbally to someone who speaks them for us,
p272
aVwords are among our most powerful tools.
p273
aa(lp274
VI have come to you through a terrible darkness,
p275
aVpulled from it by caring souls
p276
aVand by language itself.
p277
aVThe act of you listening to me today brings me farther into the light.
p278
aVWe are shining here together.
p279
aVIf there is one most difficult obstacle to my way of communicating,
p280
aVit is that sometimes I want to shout
p281
aVand other times simply to whisper a word of love or gratitude.
p282
aVIt all sounds the same.
p283
aVBut if you will,
p284
aVplease imagine these next two words as warmly as you can:
p285
aa(lp286
VThank you.
