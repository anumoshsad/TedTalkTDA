VAmongst all the troubling deficits we struggle with today \u2014
p4
aVwe think of financial and economic primarily \u2014
p5
aVthe ones that concern me most
p6
aVis the deficit of political dialogue \u2014
p7
aVour ability to address modern conflicts
p8
aVas they are,
p9
aVto go to the source of what they're all about
p10
aVand to understand the key players
p11
aVand to deal with them.
p12
aVWe who are diplomats,
p13
aVwe are trained to deal with conflicts between states and issues between states.
p14
aVAnd I can tell you, our agenda is full.
p15
aVThere is trade, there is disarmament,
p16
aVthere is cross-border relations.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut the picture is changing,
p19
aVand we are seeing that there are new key players
p20
aVcoming onto the scene.
p21
aVWe loosely call them "groups."
p22
aVThey may represent social, religious,
p23
aVpolitical, economic, military realities.
p24
aVAnd we struggle with how to deal with them.
p25
aVThe rules of engagement:
p26
aVhow to talk, when to talk,
p27
aVand how to deal with them.
p28
aa(lp29
VLet me show you a slide here
p30
aVwhich illustrates the character of conflicts
p31
aVsince 1946 until today.
p32
aVYou see the green
p33
aVis a traditional interstate conflict,
p34
aVthe ones we used to read about.
p35
aVThe red is modern conflict,
p36
aVconflicts within states.
p37
aVThese are quite different,
p38
aVand they are outside the grasp
p39
aVof modern diplomacy.
p40
aVAnd the core of these key actors
p41
aVare groups
p42
aVwho represent different interests
p43
aVinside countries.
p44
aVAnd the way they deal with their conflicts rapidly spreads to other countries.
p45
aVSo in a way, it is everybody's business.
p46
aa(lp47
VAnother acknowledgment we've seen during these years,
p48
aVrecent years,
p49
aVis that very few
p50
aVof these domestic interstate, intrastate conflicts
p51
aVcan be solved militarily.
p52
aVThey may have to be dealt with with military means,
p53
aVbut they cannot be solved by military means.
p54
aVThey need political solutions.
p55
aVAnd we, therefore, have a problem,
p56
aVbecause they escape traditional diplomacy.
p57
aVAnd we have among states
p58
aVa reluctance in dealing with them.
p59
aVPlus, during the last decade,
p60
aVwe've been in the mode
p61
aVwhere dealing with groups
p62
aVwas conceptually and politically dangerous.
p63
aVAfter 9/11,
p64
aVeither you were with us or against us.
p65
aVIt was black or white.
p66
aVAnd groups are very often
p67
aVimmediately label terrorists.
p68
aVAnd who would talk to terrorists?
p69
aVThe West, as I would see it,
p70
aVcomes out of that decade weakened,
p71
aVbecause we didn't understand the group.
p72
aVSo we've spent more time
p73
aVon focusing on why we should not talk to others
p74
aVthan finding out how we talk to others.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow I'm not naive.
p77
aVYou cannot talk to everybody all the time.
p78
aVAnd there are times you should walk.
p79
aVAnd sometimes military intervention is necessary.
p80
aVI happen to believe that Libya was necessary
p81
aVand that military intervention in Afghanistan was also necessary.
p82
aVAnd my country relies on its security
p83
aVthrough military alliance, that's clear.
p84
aVBut still we have a large deficit
p85
aVin dealing with and understanding modern conflict.
p86
aa(lp87
VLet us turn to Afghanistan.
p88
aV10 years after that military intervention,
p89
aVthat country is far from secure.
p90
aVThe situation, to be honest, is very serious.
p91
aVNow again, the military is necessary,
p92
aVbut the military is no problem-solver.
p93
aVWhen I first came to Afghanistan in 2005 as a foreign minister,
p94
aVI met the commander of ISAF,
p95
aVthe international troops.
p96
aVAnd he told me that, "This can be won militarily, minister.
p97
aVWe just have to persevere."
p98
aVNow four COM ISAF's later,
p99
aVwe hear a different message:
p100
aV"This cannot be won militarily.
p101
aVWe need military presence,
p102
aVbut we need to move to politics.
p103
aVWe can only solve this through a political solution.
p104
aVAnd it is not us who will solve it;
p105
aVAfghans have to solve it."
p106
aVBut then they need a different political process
p107
aVthan the one they were given in 2001, 2002.
p108
aVThey need an inclusive process
p109
aVwhere the real fabric of this very complicated society
p110
aVcan deal with their issues.
p111
aa(lp112
VEverybody seems to agree with that.
p113
aVIt was very controversial to say three, four, five years ago.
p114
aVNow everybody agrees.
p115
aVBut now, as we prepare to talk,
p116
aVwe understand how little we know.
p117
aVBecause we didn't talk.
p118
aVWe didn't grasp what was going on.
p119
aVThe International Committee of the Red Cross, the ICRC,
p120
aVis talking to everyone,
p121
aVand it is doing so because it is neutral.
p122
aVAnd that's one reason why
p123
aVthat organization probably
p124
aVis the best informed key player
p125
aVto understand modern conflict \u2014
p126
aVbecause they talk.
p127
aa(lp128
VMy point is that you don't have to be neutral to talk.
p129
aVAnd you don't have to agree
p130
aVwhen you sit down with the other side.
p131
aVAnd you can always walk.
p132
aVBut if you don't talk,
p133
aVyou can't engage the other side.
p134
aVAnd the other side which you're going to engage
p135
aVis the one with whom you profoundly disagree.
p136
aVPrime Minister Rabin said when he engaged the Oslo process,
p137
aV"You don't make peace with your friends,
p138
aVyou make peace with your enemies."
p139
aVIt's hard, but it is necessary.
p140
aa(lp141
VLet me go one step further.
p142
aVThis is Tahrir Square.
p143
aVThere's a revolution going on.
p144
aVThe Arab Spring is heading into fall
p145
aVand is moving into winter.
p146
aVIt will last for a long, long time.
p147
aVAnd who knows what it will be called in the end.
p148
aVThat's not the point.
p149
aVThe point is that we are probably seeing,
p150
aVfor the first time in the history of the Arab world,
p151
aVa revolution bottom-up \u2014
p152
aVpeople's revolution.
p153
aVSocial groups are taking to the streets.
p154
aVAnd we find out in the West
p155
aVthat we know very little about what's happening.
p156
aVBecause we never talk to the people in these countries.
p157
aVMost governments followed
p158
aVthe dictate of the authoritarian leaders
p159
aVto stay away from these different groups,
p160
aVbecause they were terrorists.
p161
aVSo now that they are emerging in the street
p162
aVand we salute the democratic revolution,
p163
aVwe find out how little we know.
p164
aa(lp165
VRight now, the discussion goes,
p166
aV"Should we talk to the Muslim Brotherhood?
p167
aVShould we talk to Hamas?
p168
aVIf we talk to them, we may legitimize them."
p169
aVI think that is wrong.
p170
aVIf you talk in the right way, you make it very clear
p171
aVthat talking is not agreeing.
p172
aVAnd how can we tell the Muslim Brotherhood,
p173
aVas we should,
p174
aVthat they must respect minority rights,
p175
aVif we don't accept majority rights?
p176
aVBecause they may turn out to be a majority.
p177
aVHow can we escape [having] a double-standard,
p178
aVif we at the same time preach democracy
p179
aVand at the same time
p180
aVdon't want to deal with the groups that are representative?
p181
aVHow will we ever be interlocutors?
p182
aVNow my diplomats are instructed
p183
aVto talk to all these groups.
p184
aVBut talking can be done in different ways.
p185
aVWe make a distinction between talking from a diplomatic level
p186
aVand talking at the political level.
p187
aVNow talking can be accompanied with aid or not with aid.
p188
aVTalking can be accompanied with inclusion or not inclusion.
p189
aa(lp190
VThere's a big array
p191
aVof the ways of dealing with this.
p192
aVSo if we refuse
p193
aVto talk to these new groups
p194
aVthat are going to be dominating the news in years to come,
p195
aVwe will further radicalization,
p196
aVI believe.
p197
aVWe will make the road from violent activities into politics
p198
aVharder to travel.
p199
aVAnd if we cannot demonstrate to these groups
p200
aVthat if you move towards democracy,
p201
aVif you move towards taking part
p202
aVin civilized and normal standards among states,
p203
aVthere are some rewards on the other side.
p204
aVThe paradox here
p205
aVis that the last decade probably was a lost decade
p206
aVfor making progress on this.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising \u2014
p209
aVand for one reason primarily.
p210
aVAnd the reason is what happened in South Africa:
p211
aVNelson Mandela.
p212
aVWhen Mandela came out of prison
p213
aVafter 27 years of captivity,
p214
aVif he had told his people,
p215
aV"It's time to take up the arms,
p216
aVit's time to fight,"
p217
aVhe would have been followed.
p218
aVAnd I think the international community
p219
aVwould have said, "Fair enough.
p220
aVIt's their right to fight."
p221
aVNow as you know, Mandela didn't do that.
p222
aVIn his memoirs, "Long Road to Freedom,"
p223
aVhe wrote that he survived
p224
aVduring those years of captivity
p225
aVbecause he always decided to look upon his oppressor
p226
aVas also being a human being,
p227
aValso being a human being.
p228
aVSo he engaged a political process of dialogue,
p229
aVnot as a strategy of the weak,
p230
aVbut as a strategy of the strong.
p231
aVAnd he engaged talking profoundly
p232
aVby settling some of the most tricky issues
p233
aVthrough a truth and reconciliation process
p234
aVwhere people came and talked.
p235
aVNow South African friends will know
p236
aVthat was very painful.
p237
aa(lp238
VSo what can we learn from all of this?
p239
aVDialogue is not easy \u2014
p240
aVnot between individuals, not between groups, not between governments \u2014
p241
aVbut it is very necessary.
p242
aVIf we're going to deal with political conflict-solving of conflicts,
p243
aVif we're going to understand these new groups
p244
aVwhich are coming from bottom-up,
p245
aVsupported by technology, which is available to all,
p246
aVwe diplomats cannot be sitting back in the banquets
p247
aVbelieving that we are doing interstate relations.
p248
aVWe have to connect
p249
aVwith these profound changes.
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd what is dialogue really about?
p252
aVWhen I enter into dialogue,
p253
aVI really hope that the other side
p254
aVwould pick up my points of view,
p255
aVthat I would impress upon them
p256
aVmy opinions and my values.
p257
aVI cannot do that
p258
aVunless I send the signals that I will be open
p259
aVto listen to the other side's signals.
p260
aVWe need a lot more training on how to do that
p261
aVand a lot more practice
p262
aVon how that can take problem-solving forward.
p263
aVWe know from our personal experiences
p264
aVthat it's easy sometimes
p265
aVjust to walk,
p266
aVand sometimes you may need to fight.
p267
aVAnd I wouldn't say that is the wrong thing in all circumstances.
p268
aVSometimes you have to.
p269
aVBut that strategy seldom takes you very far.
p270
aVThe alternative is a strategy
p271
aVof engagement and principled dialogue.
p272
aVAnd I believe we need to strengthen this approach
p273
aVin modern diplomacy,
p274
aVnot only between states,
p275
aVbut also within states.
p276
aa(lp277
VWe are seeing some new signs.
p278
aVWe could never have done
p279
aVthe convention against anti-personnel landmines
p280
aVand the convention that is banning cluster munitions
p281
aVunless we had done diplomacy differently,
p282
aVby engaging with civil society.
p283
aVAll of a sudden,
p284
aVNGOs were not only standing in the streets, crying their slogans,
p285
aVbut they were taking [them] into the negotiations,
p286
aVpartly because they represented the victims of these weapons.
p287
aVAnd they brought their knowledge.
p288
aVAnd there was an interaction
p289
aVbetween diplomacy and the power coming bottom-up.
p290
aVThis is perhaps a first element
p291
aVof a change.
p292
aVIn the future, I believe,
p293
aVwe should draw examples from these different illustrations,
p294
aVnot to have diplomacy
p295
aVwhich is disconnected from people and civil society.
p296
aa(lp297
VAnd we have to go also
p298
aVbeyond traditional diplomacy
p299
aVto the survival issue of our times,
p300
aVclimate change.
p301
aVHow are we going to solve climate change through negotiations,
p302
aVunless we are able to make civil society and people,
p303
aVnot part of the problem, but part of the solution?
p304
aVIt is going to demand an inclusive process of diplomacy
p305
aVvery different from the one we are practicing today
p306
aVas we are heading to new rounds of difficult climate negotiations,
p307
aVbut when we move toward something
p308
aVwhich has to be much more
p309
aValong a broad mobilization.
p310
aVIt's crucial to understand, I believe,
p311
aVbecause of technology and because of globalization,
p312
aVsocieties from bottom-up.
p313
aa(lp314
VWe as diplomats
p315
aVneed to know the social capital
p316
aVof communities.
p317
aVWhat is it that makes people trust each other,
p318
aVnot only between states,
p319
aVbut also within states?
p320
aVWhat is the legitimacy of diplomacy,
p321
aVof the the solution we devise as diplomats
p322
aVif they cannot be reflected and understood
p323
aVby also these broader forces of societies
p324
aVthat we now very loosely call groups?
p325
aa(lp326
VThe good thing is that we are not powerless.
p327
aVWe have never had
p328
aVas many means of communication,
p329
aVmeans of being connected, means of reaching out,
p330
aVmeans of including.
p331
aVThe diplomatic toolbox
p332
aVis actually full of different tools we can use
p333
aVto strengthen our communication.
p334
aVBut the problem is that we are coming out of a decade
p335
aVwhere we had a fear of touching it.
p336
aVNow, I hope, in the coming years,
p337
aVthat we are able to demonstrate through some concrete examples
p338
aVthat fear is receding
p339
aVand that we can take courage
p340
aVfrom that alliance
p341
aVwith civil society
p342
aVin different countries
p343
aVto support their problem-solving,
p344
aVamong the Afghans,
p345
aVinside the Palestinian population,
p346
aVbetween the peoples of Palestine and Israel.
p347
aa(lp348
VAnd as we try to understand this broad movement
p349
aVacross the Arab world,
p350
aVwe are not powerless.
p351
aVWe need to improve the necessary skills,
p352
aVand we need the courage to use them.
p353
aVIn my country,
p354
aVI have seen how the council of Islamist groups
p355
aVand Christian groups
p356
aVcame together, not as a government initiative,
p357
aVbut they came together on their own initiative
p358
aVto establish contact and dialogue
p359
aVin times where things were pretty low-key tension.
p360
aVAnd when tension increased,
p361
aVthey already had that dialogue,
p362
aVand that was a strength to deal with different issues.
p363
aa(lp364
VOur modern Western societies
p365
aVare more complex than before,
p366
aVin this time of migration.
p367
aVHow are we going to settle and build a bigger "We"
p368
aVto deal with our issues
p369
aVif we don't improve our skills of communication?
p370
aVSo there are many reasons,
p371
aVand for all of these reasons,
p372
aVthis is time and this is why we must talk.
p373
