VWhen I was a young man, I spent six years
p4
aVof wild adventure in the tropics
p5
aVworking as an investigative journalist
p6
aVin some of the most bewitching parts of the world.
p7
aVI was as reckless and foolish as only young men can be.
p8
aVThis is why wars get fought.
p9
aVBut I also felt more alive than I've ever done since.
p10
aVAnd when I came home, I found the scope of my existence
p11
aVgradually diminishing
p12
aVuntil loading the dishwasher seemed like an interesting challenge.
p13
aVAnd I found myself sort of
p14
aVscratching at the walls of life,
p15
aVas if I was trying to find a way out
p16
aVinto a wider space beyond.
p17
aVI was, I believe, ecologically bored.
p18
aa(lp19
VNow, we evolved in rather more challenging times than these,
p20
aVin a world of horns and tusks and fangs and claws.
p21
aVAnd we still possess the fear and the courage
p22
aVand the aggression required to navigate those times.
p23
aVBut in our comfortable, safe, crowded lands,
p24
aVwe have few opportunities to exercise them
p25
aVwithout harming other people.
p26
aVAnd this was the sort of constraint that I found myself
p27
aVbumping up against.
p28
aVTo conquer uncertainty,
p29
aVto know what comes next,
p30
aVthat's almost been the dominant aim of industrialized societies,
p31
aVand having got there, or almost got there,
p32
aVwe have just encountered a new set of unmet needs.
p33
aVWe've privileged safety over experience
p34
aVand we've gained a lot in doing so,
p35
aVbut I think we've lost something too.
p36
aa(lp37
VNow, I don't romanticize evolutionary time.
p38
aVI'm already beyond the lifespan of most hunter-gatherers,
p39
aVand the outcome of a mortal combat between me
p40
aVmyopically stumbling around with a stone-tipped spear
p41
aVand an enraged giant aurochs
p42
aVisn't very hard to predict.
p43
aVNor was it authenticity that I was looking for.
p44
aVI don't find that a useful or even intelligible concept.
p45
aVI just wanted a richer and rawer life
p46
aVthan I've been able to lead in Britain, or, indeed,
p47
aVthat we can lead in most parts of the industrialized world.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd it was only when I stumbled across an unfamiliar word
p50
aVthat I began to understand what I was looking for.
p51
aVAnd as soon as I found that word,
p52
aVI realized that I wanted to devote
p53
aVmuch of the rest of my life to it.
p54
aa(lp55
VThe word is "rewilding,"
p56
aVand even though rewilding is a young word,
p57
aVit already has several definitions.
p58
aVBut there are two in particular that fascinate me.
p59
aVThe first one is the mass restoration
p60
aVof ecosystems.
p61
aa(lp62
VOne of the most exciting scientific findings
p63
aVof the past half century
p64
aVhas been the discovery of widespread trophic cascades.
p65
aVA trophic cascade is an ecological process
p66
aVwhich starts at the top of the food chain
p67
aVand tumbles all the way down to the bottom,
p68
aVand the classic example is what happened
p69
aVin the Yellowstone National Park in the United States
p70
aVwhen wolves were reintroduced in 1995.
p71
aVNow, we all know that wolves kill various species of animals,
p72
aVbut perhaps we're slightly less aware
p73
aVthat they give life to many others.
p74
aVIt sounds strange, but just follow me for a while.
p75
aVBefore the wolves turned up,
p76
aVthey'd been absent for 70 years.
p77
aVThe numbers of deer, because there was nothing to hunt them,
p78
aVhad built up and built up in the Yellowstone Park,
p79
aVand despite efforts by humans to control them,
p80
aVthey'd managed to reduce much of the vegetation there
p81
aVto almost nothing, they'd just grazed it away.
p82
aVBut as soon as the wolves arrived,
p83
aVeven though they were few in number,
p84
aVthey started to have the most remarkable effects.
p85
aVFirst, of course, they killed some of the deer,
p86
aVbut that wasn't the major thing.
p87
aVMuch more significantly,
p88
aVthey radically changed the behavior of the deer.
p89
aVThe deer started avoiding certain parts of the park,
p90
aVthe places where they could be trapped most easily,
p91
aVparticularly the valleys and the gorges,
p92
aVand immediately those places started to regenerate.
p93
aVIn some areas, the height of the trees
p94
aVquintupled in just six years.
p95
aVBare valley sides quickly became forests of aspen
p96
aVand willow and cottonwood.
p97
aVAnd as soon as that happened,
p98
aVthe birds started moving in.
p99
aVThe number of songbirds, of migratory birds,
p100
aVstarted to increase greatly.
p101
aVThe number of beavers started to increase,
p102
aVbecause beavers like to eat the trees.
p103
aVAnd beavers, like wolves, are ecosystem engineers.
p104
aVThey create niches for other species.
p105
aVAnd the dams they built in the rivers
p106
aVprovided habitats for otters and muskrats
p107
aVand ducks and fish and reptiles and amphibians.
p108
aVThe wolves killed coyotes, and as a result of that,
p109
aVthe number of rabbits and mice began to rise,
p110
aVwhich meant more hawks, more weasels,
p111
aVmore foxes, more badgers.
p112
aVRavens and bald eagles came down to feed
p113
aVon the carrion that the wolves had left.
p114
aVBears fed on it too, and their population began to rise as well,
p115
aVpartly also because there were more berries
p116
aVgrowing on the regenerating shrubs,
p117
aVand the bears reinforced the impact of the wolves
p118
aVby killing some of the calves of the deer.
p119
aa(lp120
VBut here's where it gets really interesting.
p121
aVThe wolves changed the behavior of the rivers.
p122
aVThey began to meander less.
p123
aVThere was less erosion. The channels narrowed.
p124
aVMore pools formed, more riffle sections,
p125
aVall of which were great for wildlife habitats.
p126
aVThe rivers changed
p127
aVin response to the wolves,
p128
aVand the reason was that the regenerating forests
p129
aVstabilized the banks so that they collapsed less often,
p130
aVso that the rivers became more fixed in their course.
p131
aVSimilarly, by driving the deer out of some places
p132
aVand the vegetation recovering on the valley sides,
p133
aVthere was less soil erosion,
p134
aVbecause the vegetation stabilized that as well.
p135
aVSo the wolves, small in number,
p136
aVtransformed not just the ecosystem
p137
aVof the Yellowstone National Park, this huge area of land,
p138
aVbut also its physical geography.
p139
aa(lp140
VWhales in the southern oceans
p141
aVhave similarly wide-ranging effects.
p142
aVOne of the many post-rational excuses
p143
aVmade by the Japanese government for killing whales
p144
aVis that they said, "Well, the number of fish and krill will rise
p145
aVand then there'll be more for people to eat."
p146
aVWell, it's a stupid excuse, but it sort of
p147
aVkind of makes sense, doesn't it,
p148
aVbecause you'd think that whales eat huge amounts
p149
aVof fish and krill, so obviously take the whales away,
p150
aVthere'll be more fish and krill.
p151
aVBut the opposite happened.
p152
aVYou take the whales away,
p153
aVand the number of krill collapses.
p154
aVWhy would that possibly have happened?
p155
aVWell, it now turns out that the whales are crucial
p156
aVto sustaining that entire ecosystem,
p157
aVand one of the reasons for this
p158
aVis that they often feed at depth
p159
aVand then they come up to the surface and produce
p160
aVwhat biologists politely call large fecal plumes,
p161
aVhuge explosions of poop right across the surface waters,
p162
aVup in the photic zone, where there's enough light
p163
aVto allow photosynthesis to take place,
p164
aVand those great plumes of fertilizer
p165
aVstimulate the growth of phytoplankton,
p166
aVthe plant plankton at the bottom of the food chain,
p167
aVwhich stimulate the growth of zooplankton,
p168
aVwhich feed the fish and the krill and all the rest of it.
p169
aVThe other thing that whales do is that,
p170
aVas they're plunging up and down through the water column,
p171
aVthey're kicking the phytoplankton
p172
aVback up towards the surface
p173
aVwhere it can continue to survive and reproduce.
p174
aVAnd interestingly, well, we know
p175
aVthat plant plankton in the oceans
p176
aVabsorb carbon from the atmosphere \u2014
p177
aVthe more plant plankton there are,
p178
aVthe more carbon they absorb \u2014
p179
aVand eventually they filter down into the abyss
p180
aVand remove that carbon from the atmospheric system.
p181
aVWell, it seems that when whales were at their historic populations,
p182
aVthey were probably responsible for sequestering
p183
aVsome tens of millions of tons of carbon
p184
aVevery year from the atmosphere.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd when you look at it like that, you think,
p187
aVwait a minute, here are the wolves
p188
aVchanging the physical geography of the Yellowstone National Park.
p189
aVHere are the whales changing
p190
aVthe composition of the atmosphere.
p191
aVYou begin to see that possibly,
p192
aVthe evidence supporting James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis,
p193
aVwhich conceives of the world as a coherent,
p194
aVself-regulating organism,
p195
aVis beginning, at the ecosystem level, to accumulate.
p196
aa(lp197
VTrophic cascades
p198
aVtell us that the natural world
p199
aVis even more fascinating and complex than we thought it was.
p200
aVThey tell us that when you take away the large animals,
p201
aVyou are left with a radically different ecosystem
p202
aVto one which retains its large animals.
p203
aVAnd they make, in my view, a powerful case
p204
aVfor the reintroduction of missing species.
p205
aVRewilding, to me,
p206
aVmeans bringing back some of the missing plants and animals.
p207
aVIt means taking down the fences,
p208
aVit means blocking the drainage ditches,
p209
aVit means preventing commercial fishing in some large areas of sea,
p210
aVbut otherwise stepping back.
p211
aVIt has no view as to what a right ecosystem
p212
aVor a right assemblage of species looks like.
p213
aVIt doesn't try to produce a heath or a meadow
p214
aVor a rain forest or a kelp garden or a coral reef.
p215
aVIt lets nature decide,
p216
aVand nature, by and large, is pretty good at deciding.
p217
aa(lp218
VNow, I mentioned that there are two definitions
p219
aVof rewilding that interest me.
p220
aVThe other one
p221
aVis the rewilding of human life.
p222
aVAnd I don't see this as an alternative
p223
aVto civilization.
p224
aVI believe we can enjoy the benefits of advanced technology,
p225
aVas we're doing now, but at the same time, if we choose,
p226
aVhave access to a richer and wilder life of adventure
p227
aVwhen we want to because
p228
aVthere would be wonderful, rewilded habitats.
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd the opportunities for this
p231
aVare developing more rapidly than you might think possible.
p232
aVThere's one estimate which suggests that in the United States,
p233
aVtwo thirds of the land which was once forested and then cleared
p234
aVhas become reforested as loggers and farmers have retreated,
p235
aVparticularly from the eastern half of the country.
p236
aVThere's another one which suggests
p237
aVthat 30 million hectares of land in Europe,
p238
aVan area the size of Poland,
p239
aVwill be vacated by farmers
p240
aVbetween 2000 and 2030.
p241
aa(lp242
VNow, faced with opportunities like that,
p243
aVdoes it not seem a little unambitious
p244
aVto be thinking only of bringing back wolves, lynx,
p245
aVbears, beavers, bison, boar, moose,
p246
aVand all the other species which are already beginning
p247
aVto move quite rapidly across Europe?
p248
aVPerhaps we should also start thinking
p249
aVabout the return of some of our lost megafauna.
p250
aa(lp251
VWhat megafauna, you say?
p252
aVWell, every continent had one,
p253
aVapart from Antarctica.
p254
aVWhen Trafalgar Square in London was excavated,
p255
aVthe river gravels there were found
p256
aVto be stuffed with the bones of hippopotamus,
p257
aVrhinos, elephants, hyenas, lions.
p258
aVYes, ladies and gentlemen,
p259
aVthere were lions in Trafalgar Square
p260
aVlong before Nelson's Column was built.
p261
aVAll these species lived here
p262
aVin the last interglacial period,
p263
aVwhen temperatures were pretty similar to our own.
p264
aVIt's not climate, largely,
p265
aVwhich has got rid of the world's megafaunas.
p266
aVIt's pressure from the human population
p267
aVhunting and destroying their habitats
p268
aVwhich has done so.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd even so, you can still see the shadows
p271
aVof these great beasts in our current ecosystems.
p272
aVWhy is it that so many deciduous trees
p273
aVare able to sprout from whatever point the trunk is broken?
p274
aVWhy is it that they can withstand the loss
p275
aVof so much of their bark?
p276
aVWhy do understory trees,
p277
aVwhich are subject to lower sheer forces from the wind
p278
aVand have to carry less weight
p279
aVthan the big canopy trees,
p280
aVwhy are they so much tougher and harder to break
p281
aVthan the canopy trees are?
p282
aVElephants.
p283
aVThey are elephant-adapted.
p284
aVIn Europe, for example,
p285
aVthey evolved to resist the straight-tusked elephant,
p286
aVelephas antiquus, which was a great beast.
p287
aVIt was related to the Asian elephant,
p288
aVbut it was a temperate animal, a temperate forest creature.
p289
aVIt was a lot bigger than the Asian elephant.
p290
aVBut why is it that some of our common shrubs
p291
aVhave spines which seem to be over-engineered
p292
aVto resist browsing by deer?
p293
aVPerhaps because they evolved
p294
aVto resist browsing by rhinoceros.
p295
aa(lp296
VIsn't it an amazing thought
p297
aVthat every time you wander into a park
p298
aVor down an avenue or through a leafy street,
p299
aVyou can see the shadows of these great beasts?
p300
aVPaleoecology, the study of past ecosystems,
p301
aVcrucial to an understanding of our own,
p302
aVfeels like a portal through which you may pass
p303
aVinto an enchanted kingdom.
p304
aVAnd if we really are looking at areas of land
p305
aVof the sort of sizes I've been talking about becoming available,
p306
aVwhy not reintroduce some of our lost megafauna,
p307
aVor at least species closely related to those
p308
aVwhich have become extinct everywhere?
p309
aVWhy shouldn't all of us
p310
aVhave a Serengeti on our doorsteps?
p311
aa(lp312
VAnd perhaps this is the most important thing
p313
aVthat rewilding offers us,
p314
aVthe most important thing that's missing from our lives:
p315
aVhope.
p316
aVIn motivating people to love and defend the natural world,
p317
aVan ounce of hope is worth a ton of despair.
p318
aVThe story rewilding tells us
p319
aVis that ecological change need not always proceed
p320
aVin one direction.
p321
aVIt offers us the hope
p322
aVthat our silent spring
p323
aVcould be replaced by a raucous summer.
