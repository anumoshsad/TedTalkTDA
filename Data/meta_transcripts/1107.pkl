VThe idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm
p4
aVis actually quite simple.
p5
aVWe don't want Iran to get the bomb.
p6
aVTheir major asset for developing nuclear weapons
p7
aVis the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.
p8
aVThe gray boxes that you see,
p9
aVthese are real-time control systems.
p10
aVNow if we manage to compromise these systems
p11
aVthat control drive speeds and valves,
p12
aVwe can actually cause a lot of problems
p13
aVwith the centrifuge.
p14
aVThe gray boxes don't run Windows software;
p15
aVthey are a completely different technology.
p16
aVBut if we manage
p17
aVto place a good Windows virus
p18
aVon a notebook
p19
aVthat is used by a maintenance engineer
p20
aVto configure this gray box,
p21
aVthen we are in business.
p22
aVAnd this is the plot behind Stuxnet.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo we start with a Windows dropper.
p25
aVThe payload goes onto the gray box,
p26
aVdamages the centrifuge,
p27
aVand the Iranian nuclear program is delayed \u2014
p28
aVmission accomplished.
p29
aVThat's easy, huh?
p30
aVI want to tell you how we found that out.
p31
aVWhen we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago,
p32
aVit was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was.
p33
aVThe only thing that was known
p34
aVis it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part,
p35
aVused multiple zero-day vulnerabilities.
p36
aVAnd it seemed to want to do something
p37
aVwith these gray boxes, these real-time control systems.
p38
aVSo that got our attention,
p39
aVand we started a lab project
p40
aVwhere we infected our environment with Stuxnet
p41
aVand checked this thing out.
p42
aVAnd then some very funny things happened.
p43
aVStuxnet behaved like a lab rat
p44
aVthat didn't like our cheese \u2014
p45
aVsniffed, but didn't want to eat.
p46
aVDidn't make sense to me.
p47
aVAnd after we experimented with different flavors of cheese,
p48
aVI realized, well, this is a directed attack.
p49
aVIt's completely directed.
p50
aVThe dropper is prowling actively
p51
aVon the gray box
p52
aVif a specific configuration is found,
p53
aVand even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect
p54
aVis actually running on that target.
p55
aVAnd if not, Stuxnet does nothing.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo that really got my attention,
p58
aVand we started to work on this
p59
aVnearly around the clock,
p60
aVbecause I thought, "Well, we don't know what the target is.
p61
aVIt could be, let's say for example,
p62
aVa U.S. power plant,
p63
aVor a chemical plant in Germany.
p64
aVSo we better find out what the target is soon."
p65
aVSo we extracted and decompiled
p66
aVthe attack code,
p67
aVand we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs \u2014
p68
aVa smaller one and a bigger one.
p69
aVAnd we also saw that they are very professionally engineered
p70
aVby people who obviously had all insider information.
p71
aVThey knew all the bits and bites
p72
aVthat they had to attack.
p73
aVThey probably even know the shoe size of the operator.
p74
aVSo they know everything.
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet
p77
aVis complex and high-tech,
p78
aVlet me tell you this:
p79
aVthe payload is rocket science.
p80
aVIt's way above everything
p81
aVthat we have ever seen before.
p82
aVHere you see a sample of this actual attack code.
p83
aVWe are talking about \u2014
p84
aVaround about 15,000 lines of code.
p85
aVLooks pretty much like old-style assembly language.
p86
aVAnd I want to tell you how we were able
p87
aVto make sense out of this code.
p88
aVSo what we were looking for is, first of all, system function calls,
p89
aVbecause we know what they do.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd then we were looking for timers and data structures
p92
aVand trying to relate them to the real world \u2014
p93
aVto potential real world targets.
p94
aVSo we do need target theories
p95
aVthat we can prove or disprove.
p96
aVIn order to get target theories,
p97
aVwe remember
p98
aVthat it's definitely hardcore sabotage,
p99
aVit must be a high-value target
p100
aVand it is most likely located in Iran,
p101
aVbecause that's where most of the infections had been reported.
p102
aVNow you don't find several thousand targets in that area.
p103
aVIt basically boils down
p104
aVto the Bushehr nuclear power plant
p105
aVand to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo I told my assistant,
p108
aV"Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base."
p109
aVAnd I phoned them up and picked their brain
p110
aVin an effort to match their expertise
p111
aVwith what we found in code and data.
p112
aVAnd that worked pretty well.
p113
aVSo we were able to associate
p114
aVthe small digital warhead
p115
aVwith the rotor control.
p116
aVThe rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge,
p117
aVthat black object that you see.
p118
aVAnd if you manipulate the speed of this rotor,
p119
aVyou are actually able to crack the rotor
p120
aVand eventually even have the centrifuge explode.
p121
aVWhat we also saw
p122
aVis that the goal of the attack
p123
aVwas really to do it slowly and creepy \u2014
p124
aVobviously in an effort
p125
aVto drive maintenance engineers crazy,
p126
aVthat they would not be able to figure this out quickly.
p127
aa(lp128
VThe big digital warhead \u2014 we had a shot at this
p129
aVby looking very closely
p130
aVat data and data structures.
p131
aVSo for example, the number 164
p132
aVreally stands out in that code;
p133
aVyou can't overlook it.
p134
aVI started to research scientific literature
p135
aVon how these centrifuges
p136
aVare actually built in Natanz
p137
aVand found they are structured
p138
aVin what is called a cascade,
p139
aVand each cascade holds 164 centrifuges.
p140
aVSo that made sense, that was a match.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd it even got better.
p143
aVThese centrifuges in Iran
p144
aVare subdivided into 15, what is called, stages.
p145
aVAnd guess what we found in the attack code?
p146
aVAn almost identical structure.
p147
aVSo again, that was a real good match.
p148
aVAnd this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at.
p149
aVNow don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this.
p150
aVThese results have been obtained
p151
aVover several weeks of really hard labor.
p152
aVAnd we often went into just a dead end
p153
aVand had to recover.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnyway, so we figured out
p156
aVthat both digital warheads
p157
aVwere actually aiming at one and the same target,
p158
aVbut from different angles.
p159
aVThe small warhead is taking one cascade,
p160
aVand spinning up the rotors and slowing them down,
p161
aVand the big warhead
p162
aVis talking to six cascades
p163
aVand manipulating valves.
p164
aVSo in all, we are very confident
p165
aVthat we have actually determined what the target is.
p166
aVIt is Natanz, and it is only Natanz.
p167
aVSo we don't have to worry
p168
aVthat other targets
p169
aVmight be hit by Stuxnet.
p170
aa(lp171
VHere's some very cool stuff that we saw \u2014
p172
aVreally knocked my socks off.
p173
aVDown there is the gray box,
p174
aVand on the top you see the centrifuges.
p175
aVNow what this thing does
p176
aVis it intercepts the input values from sensors \u2014
p177
aVso for example, from pressure sensors
p178
aVand vibration sensors \u2014
p179
aVand it provides legitimate program code,
p180
aVwhich is still running during the attack,
p181
aVwith fake input data.
p182
aVAnd as a matter of fact, this fake input data
p183
aVis actually prerecorded by Stuxnet.
p184
aVSo it's just like from the Hollywood movies
p185
aVwhere during the heist,
p186
aVthe observation camera is fed with prerecorded video.
p187
aVThat's cool, huh?
p188
aa(lp189
VThe idea here is obviously
p190
aVnot only to fool the operators in the control room.
p191
aVIt actually is much more dangerous and aggressive.
p192
aVThe idea
p193
aVis to circumvent a digital safety system.
p194
aVWe need digital safety systems
p195
aVwhere a human operator could not act quick enough.
p196
aVSo for example, in a power plant,
p197
aVwhen your big steam turbine gets too over speed,
p198
aVyou must open relief valves within a millisecond.
p199
aVObviously, this cannot be done by a human operator.
p200
aVSo this is where we need digital safety systems.
p201
aVAnd when they are compromised,
p202
aVthen real bad things can happen.
p203
aVYour plant can blow up.
p204
aVAnd neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it.
p205
aVThat's scary.
p206
aa(lp207
VBut it gets worse.
p208
aVAnd this is very important, what I'm going to say.
p209
aVThink about this:
p210
aVthis attack is generic.
p211
aVIt doesn't have anything to do, in specifics,
p212
aVwith centrifuges,
p213
aVwith uranium enrichment.
p214
aVSo it would work as well, for example,
p215
aVin a power plant
p216
aVor in an automobile factory.
p217
aVIt is generic.
p218
aVAnd you don't have \u2014 as an attacker \u2014
p219
aVyou don't have to deliver this payload
p220
aVby a USB stick,
p221
aVas we saw it in the case of Stuxnet.
p222
aVYou could also use conventional worm technology for spreading.
p223
aVJust spread it as wide as possible.
p224
aVAnd if you do that,
p225
aVwhat you end up with
p226
aVis a cyber weapon of mass destruction.
p227
aVThat's the consequence
p228
aVthat we have to face.
p229
aVSo unfortunately,
p230
aVthe biggest number of targets for such attacks
p231
aVare not in the Middle East.
p232
aVThey're in the United States and Europe and in Japan.
p233
aVSo all of the green areas,
p234
aVthese are your target-rich environments.
p235
aVWe have to face the consequences,
p236
aVand we better start to prepare right now.
p237
aa(lp238
VThanks.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Applause)
p241
aa(lp242
VChris Anderson: I've got a question.
p243
aVRalph, it's been quite widely reported
p244
aVthat people assume that Mossad
p245
aVis the main entity behind this.
p246
aVIs that your opinion?
p247
aa(lp248
VRalph Langner: Okay, you really want to hear that?
p249
aVYeah. Okay.
p250
aVMy opinion is that the Mossad is involved,
p251
aVbut that the leading force is not Israel.
p252
aVSo the leading force behind that
p253
aVis the cyber superpower.
p254
aVThere is only one,
p255
aVand that's the United States \u2014
p256
aVfortunately, fortunately.
p257
aVBecause otherwise,
p258
aVour problems would even be bigger.
