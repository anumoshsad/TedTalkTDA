VI come from Lebanon,
p4
aVand I believe that running can change the world.
p5
aVI know what I have just said is simply not obvious.
p6
aa(lp7
VYou know, Lebanon as a country has been once destroyed
p8
aVby a long and bloody civil war.
p9
aVHonestly, I don't know why they call it civil war
p10
aVwhen there is nothing civil about it.
p11
aVWith Syria to the north, Israel and Palestine to the south,
p12
aVand our government even up till this moment
p13
aVis still fragmented and unstable.
p14
aVFor years, the country has been divided between politics and religion.
p15
aVHowever, for one day a year,
p16
aVwe truly stand united,
p17
aVand that's when the marathon takes place.
p18
aa(lp19
VI used to be a marathon runner.
p20
aVLong distance running was not only good for my well-being
p21
aVbut it helped me meditate and dream big.
p22
aVSo the longer distances I ran,
p23
aVthe bigger my dreams became.
p24
aVUntil one fateful morning,
p25
aVand while training, I was hit by a bus.
p26
aVI nearly died, was in a coma,
p27
aVstayed at the hospital for two years,
p28
aVand underwent 36 surgeries to be able to walk again.
p29
aa(lp30
VAs soon as I came out of my coma,
p31
aVI realized that I was no longer the same runner I used to be,
p32
aVso I decided, if I couldn't run myself,
p33
aVI wanted to make sure that others could.
p34
aVSo out of my hospital bed,
p35
aVI asked my husband to start taking notes,
p36
aVand a few months later, the marathon was born.
p37
aa(lp38
VOrganizing a marathon as a reaction to an accident
p39
aVmay sound strange,
p40
aVbut at that time, even during my most vulnerable condition,
p41
aVI needed to dream big.
p42
aVI needed something to take me out of my pain,
p43
aVan objective to look forward to.
p44
aVI didn't want to pity myself, nor to be pitied,
p45
aVand I thought by organizing such a marathon,
p46
aVI'll be able to pay back to my community,
p47
aVbuild bridges with the outside world,
p48
aVand invite runners to come to Lebanon
p49
aVand run under the umbrella of peace.
p50
aa(lp51
VOrganizing a marathon in Lebanon
p52
aVis definitely not like organizing one in New York.
p53
aVHow do you introduce the concept of running
p54
aVto a nation that is constantly at the brink of war?
p55
aVHow do you ask those who were once fighting
p56
aVand killing each other
p57
aVto come together and run next to each other?
p58
aVMore than that, how do you convince people to run a distance of 26.2 miles
p59
aVat a time they were not even familiar with the word "marathon"?
p60
aVSo we had to start from scratch.
p61
aa(lp62
VFor almost two years, we went all over the country
p63
aVand even visited remote villages.
p64
aVI personally met with people from all walks of life \u2014
p65
aVmayors, NGOs, schoolchildren,
p66
aVpoliticians, militiamen,
p67
aVpeople from mosques, churches,
p68
aVthe president of the country, even housewives.
p69
aVI learned one thing:
p70
aVWhen you walk the talk, people believe you.
p71
aVMany were touched by my personal story,
p72
aVand they shared their stories in return.
p73
aVIt was honesty and transparency that brought us together.
p74
aVWe spoke one common language to each other,
p75
aVand that was from one human to another.
p76
aVOnce that trust was built,
p77
aVeverybody wanted to be part of the marathon
p78
aVto show the world the true colors of Lebanon and the Lebanese
p79
aVand their desire to live in peace and harmony.
p80
aa(lp81
VIn October 2003, over 6,000 runners
p82
aVfrom 49 different nationalities
p83
aVcame to the start line, all determined,
p84
aVand when the gunfire went off,
p85
aVthis time it was a signal to run in harmony,
p86
aVfor a change.
p87
aa(lp88
VThe marathon grew.
p89
aVSo did our political problems.
p90
aVBut for every disaster we had,
p91
aVthe marathon found ways to bring people together.
p92
aVIn 2005, our prime minister was assassinated,
p93
aVand the country came to a complete standstill,
p94
aVso we organized a five-kilometer United We Run campaign.
p95
aVOver 60,000 people came to the start line,
p96
aVall wearing white T-shirts with no political slogans.
p97
aVThat was a turning point for the marathon,
p98
aVwhere people started looking at it as a platform
p99
aVfor peace and unity.
p100
aa(lp101
VBetween 2006 up to 2009, our country, Lebanon,
p102
aVwent through unstable years,
p103
aVinvasions, and more assassinations
p104
aVthat brought us close to a civil war.
p105
aVThe country was divided again,
p106
aVso much that our parliament resigned,
p107
aVwe had no president for a year, and no prime minister.
p108
aVBut we did have a marathon.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Applause)
p111
aa(lp112
VSo through the marathon, we learned that political problems can be overcome.
p113
aVWhen the opposition party decided to shut down part of the city center,
p114
aVwe negotiated alternative routes.
p115
aVGovernment protesters became sideline cheerleaders.
p116
aVThey even hosted juice stations.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VYou know, the marathon has really become one of its kind.
p121
aVIt gained credibility
p122
aVfrom both the Lebanese and the international community.
p123
aVLast November 2012, over 33,000 runners from 85 different nationalities
p124
aVcame to the start line,
p125
aVbut this time, they challenged a very stormy and rainy weather.
p126
aVThe streets were flooded, but people didn't want to miss out
p127
aVon the opportunity of being part of such a national day.
p128
aa(lp129
VBMA has expanded.
p130
aVWe include everyone: the young, the elderly,
p131
aVthe disabled, the mentally challenged,
p132
aVthe blind, the elite, the amateur runners,
p133
aVeven moms with their babies.
p134
aVThemes have included runs for the environment,
p135
aVbreast cancer, for the love of Lebanon, for peace,
p136
aVor just simply to run.
p137
aa(lp138
VThe first annual all-women-and-girls race for empowerment,
p139
aVwhich is one of its kind in the region,
p140
aVhas just taken place only a few weeks ago,
p141
aVwith 4,512 women, including the first lady,
p142
aVand this is only the beginning.
p143
aa(lp144
VThank you.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Applause)
p147
aa(lp148
VBMA has supported charities and volunteers
p149
aVwho have helped reshape Lebanon,
p150
aVraising funds for their causes
p151
aVand encouraging others to give.
p152
aVThe culture of giving and doing good has become contagious.
p153
aVStereotypes have been broken.
p154
aVChange-makers and future leaders have been created.
p155
aVI believe these are the building blocks for future peace.
p156
aa(lp157
VBMA has become such a respected event in the region
p158
aVthat government officials in the region,
p159
aVlike Iraq, Egypt and Syria,
p160
aVhave asked the organization to help them structure a similar sporting event.
p161
aVWe are now one of the largest running events in the Middle East,
p162
aVbut most importantly,
p163
aVit is a platform for hope and cooperation
p164
aVin an ever-fragile and unstable part of the world.
p165
aVFrom Boston to Beirut, we stand as one.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Applause)
p168
aa(lp169
VAfter 10 years in Lebanon,
p170
aVfrom national marathons or from national events
p171
aVto smaller regional races,
p172
aVwe've seen that people want to run for a better future.
p173
aVAfter all, peacemaking is not a sprint.
p174
aVIt is more of a marathon.
p175
aa(lp176
VThank you.
