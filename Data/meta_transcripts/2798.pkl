VPaying close attention to something:
p4
aVNot that easy, is it?
p5
aVIt's because our attention is pulled in so many different directions at a time,
p6
aVand it's in fact pretty impressive if you can stay focused.
p7
aa(lp8
VMany people think that attention is all about what we are focusing on,
p9
aVbut it's also about what information our brain is trying to filter out.
p10
aa(lp11
VThere are two ways you direct your attention.
p12
aVFirst, there's overt attention.
p13
aVIn overt attention, you move your eyes towards something
p14
aVin order to pay attention to it.
p15
aVThen there's covert attention.
p16
aVIn covert attention, you pay attention to something,
p17
aVbut without moving your eyes.
p18
aVThink of driving for a second.
p19
aVYour overt attention, your direction of the eyes,
p20
aVare in front,
p21
aVbut that's your covert attention
p22
aVwhich is constantly scanning the surrounding area,
p23
aVwhere you don't actually look at them.
p24
aa(lp25
VI'm a computational neuroscientist,
p26
aVand I work on cognitive brain-machine interfaces,
p27
aVor bringing together the brain and the computer.
p28
aVI love brain patterns.
p29
aVBrain patterns are important for us
p30
aVbecause based on them we can build models for the computers,
p31
aVand based on these models
p32
aVcomputers can recognize how well our brain functions.
p33
aVAnd if it doesn't function well,
p34
aVthen these computers themselves can be used as assistive devices
p35
aVfor therapies.
p36
aVBut that also means something,
p37
aVbecause choosing the wrong patterns
p38
aVwill give us the wrong models
p39
aVand therefore the wrong therapies.
p40
aVRight?
p41
aVIn case of attention,
p42
aVthe fact that we can
p43
aVshift our attention not only by our eyes
p44
aVbut also by thinking \u2014
p45
aVthat makes covert attention an interesting model for computers.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo I wanted to know what are the brainwave patterns
p48
aVwhen you look overtly or when you look covertly.
p49
aVI set up an experiment for that.
p50
aVIn this experiment there are two flickering squares,
p51
aVone of them flickering at a slower rate than the other one.
p52
aVDepending on which of these flickers you are paying attention to,
p53
aVcertain parts of your brain will start resonating in the same rate
p54
aVas that flickering rate.
p55
aVSo by analyzing your brain signals,
p56
aVwe can track where exactly you are watching
p57
aVor you are paying attention to.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo to see what happens in your brain when you pay overt attention,
p60
aVI asked people to look directly in one of the squares
p61
aVand pay attention to it.
p62
aVIn this case, not surprisingly, we saw that these flickering squares
p63
aVappeared in their brain signals
p64
aVwhich was coming from the back of their head,
p65
aVwhich is responsible for the processing of your visual information.
p66
aVBut I was really interested
p67
aVto see what happens in your brain when you pay covert attention.
p68
aVSo this time I asked people to look in the middle of the screen
p69
aVand without moving their eyes,
p70
aVto pay attention to either of these squares.
p71
aVWhen we did that,
p72
aVwe saw that both of these flickering rates appeared in their brain signals,
p73
aVbut interestingly,
p74
aVonly one of them, which was paid attention to,
p75
aVhad stronger signals,
p76
aVso there was something in the brain
p77
aVwhich was handling this information
p78
aVso that thing in the brain was basically the activation of the frontal area.
p79
aVThe front part of your brain is responsible
p80
aVfor higher cognitive functions as a human.
p81
aVThe frontal part, it seems that it works as a filter
p82
aVtrying to let information come in only from the right flicker
p83
aVthat you are paying attention to
p84
aVand trying to inhibit the information coming from the ignored one.
p85
aa(lp86
VThe filtering ability of the brain is indeed a key for attention,
p87
aVwhich is missing in some people,
p88
aVfor example in people with ADHD.
p89
aVSo a person with ADHD cannot inhibit these distractors,
p90
aVand that's why they can't focus for a long time on a single task.
p91
aVBut what if this person
p92
aVcould play a specific computer game
p93
aVwith his brain connected to the computer,
p94
aVand then train his own brain
p95
aVto inhibit these distractors?
p96
aa(lp97
VWell, ADHD is just one example.
p98
aVWe can use these cognitive brain-machine interfaces
p99
aVfor many other cognitive fields.
p100
aVIt was just a few years ago
p101
aVthat my grandfather had a stroke, and he lost complete ability to speak.
p102
aVHe could understand everybody, but there was no way to respond,
p103
aVeven not writing because he was illiterate.
p104
aVSo he passed away in silence.
p105
aVI remember thinking at that time:
p106
aVWhat if we could have a computer
p107
aVwhich could speak for him?
p108
aVNow, after years that I am in this field,
p109
aVI can see that this might be possible.
p110
aVImagine if we can find brainwave patterns
p111
aVwhen people think about images or even letters,
p112
aVlike the letter A generates a different brainwave pattern
p113
aVthan the letter B, and so on.
p114
aVCould a computer one day communicate for people who can't speak?
p115
aVWhat if a computer
p116
aVcan help us understand the thoughts of a person in a coma?
p117
aVWe are not there yet,
p118
aVbut pay close attention.
p119
aVWe will be there soon.
