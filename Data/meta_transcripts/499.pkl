VWhen most people think about the beginnings
p4
aVof AIDS, they're gonna think back to the 1980s.
p5
aVAnd certainly, this was the decade in which we discovered AIDS
p6
aVand the virus that causes it, HIV.
p7
aVBut in fact this virus crossed over into humans many decades before,
p8
aVfrom chimpanzees, where the virus originated, into humans who hunt these apes.
p9
aa(lp10
VThis photo was taken before the Great Depression
p11
aVin Brazzaville, Congo.
p12
aVAt this time, there were thousands of individuals,
p13
aVwe think, that were infected with HIV.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo I have a couple of really important questions for you.
p16
aVIf this virus was in thousands
p17
aVof individuals at this point,
p18
aVwhy was it the case that it took us until 1984
p19
aVto be able to discover this virus?
p20
aVOK now, more importantly,
p21
aVhad we been there in the '40s and '50s, '60s,
p22
aVhad we seen this disease, had we understood
p23
aVexactly what was going on with it, how might that have changed and completely
p24
aVtransformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved?
p25
aa(lp26
VIn fact, this is not unique to HIV. The vast majority of
p27
aVviruses come from animals.
p28
aVAnd you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubbling up of viruses
p29
aVfrom animals into human populations.
p30
aVBut only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human.
p31
aVNevertheless, we spend the vast majority
p32
aVof our energy focused on this level of the pyramid,
p33
aVtrying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings,
p34
aVthat are going to be very very difficult to address \u2014
p35
aVas we've seen in the case of HIV.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo during the last 15 years,
p38
aVI've been working to actually study the earlier interface here \u2014
p39
aVwhat I've labeled "viral chatter," which was a term coined
p40
aVby my mentor Don Burke.
p41
aVThis is the idea that we can study the sort of
p42
aVpinging of these viruses into human populations,
p43
aVthe movement of these agents over into humans;
p44
aVand by capturing this moment,
p45
aVwe might be able to move to a situation where we can catch them early.
p46
aa(lp47
VOK, so this is a picture, and I'm going to show you
p48
aVsome pictures now from the field.
p49
aVThis is a picture of a central African hunter.
p50
aVIt's actually a fairly common picture.
p51
aVOne of the things I want you to note from it
p52
aVis blood \u2014 that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact.
p53
aVThis was absolutely key for us. This is a
p54
aVvery intimate form of connection.
p55
aVSo if we're going to study viral chatter, we need to
p56
aVget to these populations who have intensive contact with wild animals.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd so we've been studying people like this individual.
p59
aVWe collect blood from them, other specimens.
p60
aVWe look at the diseases, which are in the animals as well as the humans.
p61
aVAnd ideally, this is going to allow us to catch these things
p62
aVearly on, as they're moving over into human populations.
p63
aVAnd the basic objective of this work is not to just
p64
aVgo out once and look at these individuals,
p65
aVbut to establish thousands of individuals
p66
aVin these populations that we would monitor
p67
aVcontinuously on a regular basis.
p68
aVWhen they were sick, we would collect specimens from them.
p69
aa(lp70
VWe would actually enlist them \u2014
p71
aVwhich we've done now \u2014 to collect specimens from animals.
p72
aVWe give them these little pieces of filter paper.
p73
aVWhen they sample from animals,
p74
aVthey collect the blood on the filter paper
p75
aVand this allows us to identify yet-unknown viruses from exactly the right animals \u2014
p76
aVthe ones that are actually being hunted.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Video) Narrator: Deep in a remote region of Cameroon,
p79
aVtwo hunters stalk their prey.
p80
aVTheir names are Patrice and Patee.
p81
aVThey're searching for bush meat;
p82
aVforest animals they can kill to feed their families.
p83
aVPatrice and Patee set out most days to go out hunting
p84
aVin the forest around their homes.
p85
aVThey have a series of traps, of snares that they've set up
p86
aVto catch wild pigs, snakes, monkeys,
p87
aVrodents \u2014 anything they can, really.
p88
aVPatrice and Patee have been out for hours but found nothing.
p89
aVThe animals are simply gone.
p90
aa(lp91
VWe stop for a drink of water.
p92
aVThen there is a rustle in the brush.
p93
aVA group of hunters approach,
p94
aVtheir packs loaded with wild game.
p95
aVThere's at least three viruses
p96
aVthat you know about, which are in this particular monkey.
p97
aa(lp98
VNathan Wolfe: This species, yeah. And there's many many more pathogens
p99
aVthat are present in these animals.
p100
aVThese individuals are at specific risk,
p101
aVparticularly if there's blood contact, they're at risk for transmission
p102
aVand possibly infection with novel viruses.
p103
aa(lp104
VNarrator: As the hunters display their kills, something surprising happens.
p105
aVThey show us filter paper they've used to collect the animals' blood.
p106
aVThe blood will be tested for zoonotic viruses,
p107
aVpart of a program Dr. Wolfe has spent years setting up.
p108
aa(lp109
VNW: So this is from this animal right here,
p110
aVGreater Spot-Nosed Guenon.
p111
aVEvery person who has one of those filter papers has at least,
p112
aVat a minimum, been through our basic health education
p113
aVabout the risks associated with these activities,
p114
aVwhich presumably, from our perspective,
p115
aVgives them the ability to decrease their own risk,
p116
aVand then obviously the risk to their families,
p117
aVthe village, the country, and the world.
p118
aa(lp119
VNW: OK, before I continue, I think it's important to take just a moment
p120
aVto talk about bush meat. Bush meat is the hunting of wild game.
p121
aVOK? And you can consider all sorts of different bush meat.
p122
aVI'm going to be talking about this.
p123
aVWhen your children and grandchildren
p124
aVsort of pose questions to you about this period of time,
p125
aVone of the things they're gonna ask you,
p126
aVis how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives,
p127
aVsome of the most valuable and endangered species
p128
aVon our planet, to go extinct because we
p129
aVweren't able to address some of the issues
p130
aVof poverty in these parts of the world.
p131
aa(lp132
VBut in fact that's not the only question they're going to ask you about this.
p133
aVThey're also going to ask you the question
p134
aVthat when we knew that this was the way that HIV entered
p135
aVinto the human population,
p136
aVand that other diseases had the potential to enter like this,
p137
aVwhy did we let these behaviors continue?
p138
aVWhy did we not find some other solution to this?
p139
aVThey're going to say, in regions of profound
p140
aVinstability throughout the world,
p141
aVwhere you have intense poverty, where populations are growing
p142
aVand you don't have sustainable resources like this,
p143
aVthis is going to lead to food insecurity.
p144
aa(lp145
VBut they're also going to ask you probably a different question.
p146
aVIt's one that I think we all need to ask ourselves,
p147
aVwhich is, why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here.
p148
aVNow this is the individual \u2014 you can see just right up over his right shoulder \u2014
p149
aVthis is the individual that hunted the monkey
p150
aVfrom the last picture that I showed you.
p151
aVOK, take a look at his shirt.
p152
aVYou know, take a look at his face.
p153
aVBush meat is one of the central crises,
p154
aVwhich is occurring in our population right now,
p155
aVin humanity, on this planet.
p156
aVBut it can't be the fault of somebody like this.
p157
aVOK? And solving it cannot be his responsibility alone.
p158
aVThere's no easy solutions,
p159
aVbut what I'm saying to you is that we neglect this problem
p160
aVat our own peril.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo, in 1998, along with my mentors
p163
aVDon Burke and Colonel Mpoudi-Ngole,
p164
aVwe went to actually start this work
p165
aVin Central Africa, to work with hunters
p166
aVin this part of the world.
p167
aVAnd my job \u2014 at that time I was a post-doctoral fellow,
p168
aVand I was really tasked with setting this up.
p169
aVSo I said to myself, "OK, great \u2014
p170
aVwe're gonna collect all kinds of specimens. We're gonna go to all these
p171
aVdifferent locations. It's going to be wonderful."
p172
aVYou know, I looked at the map; I picked out 17 sites;
p173
aVI figured, no problem.
p174
aV(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
VNeedless to say, I was drastically wrong.
p177
aVThis is challenging work to do.
p178
aVFortunately, I had and continue to have
p179
aVan absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team,
p180
aVand that's the only way that this work can really occur.
p181
aVWe have a whole range of challenges about this work.
p182
aa(lp183
VOne of them is just obtaining trust
p184
aVfrom individuals that we work with in the field.
p185
aVThe person you see on the right hand side is Paul DeLong-Minutu.
p186
aVHe's one of the best communicators that I've really ever dealt with.
p187
aVWhen I arrived I didn't speak a word of French,
p188
aVand I still seemed to understand what it was he was saying.
p189
aVPaul worked for years
p190
aVon the Cameroonian national radio and television,
p191
aVand he spoke about health issues. He was a health correspondent.
p192
aVSo we figured we'd hire this person \u2014 when we got there he could
p193
aVbe a great communicator.
p194
aVWhen we would get to these rural villages, though, what we found out
p195
aVis that no one had television,
p196
aVso they wouldn't recognize his face.
p197
aVBut \u2014 when he began to speak
p198
aVthey would actually recognize his voice from the radio.
p199
aVAnd this was somebody who had incredible
p200
aVpotential to spread aspects of our message,
p201
aVwhether it be with regards to wildlife conservation
p202
aVor health prevention.
p203
aa(lp204
VOften we run into obstacles. This is us coming back from
p205
aVone of these very rural sites,
p206
aVwith specimens from 200 individuals
p207
aVthat we needed to get back to the lab within 48 hours.
p208
aVI like to show this shot \u2014 this is
p209
aVUbald Tamoufe, who's the lead
p210
aVinvestigator in our Cameroon site.
p211
aVUbald laughs at me when I show this photo
p212
aVbecause of course you can't see his face.
p213
aVBut the reason I like to show the shot
p214
aVis because you can see that he's about to solve this problem.
p215
aV(Laughter)
p216
aVWhich \u2014 which he did, which he did.
p217
aVJust a few quick before and after shots.
p218
aVThis was our laboratory before.
p219
aVThis is what it looks like now.
p220
aVEarly on, in order to ship our specimens,
p221
aVwe had to have dry ice. To get dry ice we had to go
p222
aVto the breweries \u2014 beg, borrow, steal to get these folks to give it to us.
p223
aVNow we have our own liquid nitrogen.
p224
aVI like to call our laboratory the coldest place in Central Africa \u2014 it might be.
p225
aVAnd here's a shot of me, this is the before shot of me.
p226
aV(Laughter)
p227
aVNo comment.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo what happened? So during the 10 years that we've been doing
p230
aVthis work, we actually surprised ourselves.
p231
aVWe made a number of discoveries.
p232
aVAnd what we've found is that if you look in the right place,
p233
aVyou can actually monitor the flow
p234
aVof these viruses into human populations.
p235
aVThat gave us a tremendous amount of hope.
p236
aVWhat we've found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals,
p237
aVincluding new viruses in the same group
p238
aVas HIV \u2014 so, brand new retroviruses.
p239
aVAnd let's face it, any new retrovirus in the
p240
aVhuman population \u2014 it's something we should be aware of.
p241
aVIt's something we should be following. It's not something
p242
aVthat we should be surprised by.
p243
aa(lp244
VNeedless to say in the past
p245
aVthese viruses entering into these rural communities
p246
aVmight very well have gone extinct.
p247
aVThat's no longer the case. Logging roads provide access to urban areas.
p248
aVAnd critically, what happens in central Africa
p249
aVdoesn't stay in Central Africa.
p250
aVSo, once we discovered that it was really possible
p251
aVthat we could actually do this monitoring,
p252
aVwe decided to move this from research, to
p253
aVreally attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort.
p254
aVThrough generous support and partnership
p255
aVscientifically with Google.org and the Skoll Foundation,
p256
aVwe were able to start the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative
p257
aVand begin work in four different sites
p258
aVin Africa and Asia.
p259
aVNeedless to say, different populations from different parts of the world
p260
aVhave different sorts of contact.
p261
aVSo it's not just hunters in Central Africa.
p262
aVIt's also working in live animal markets \u2014
p263
aVthese wet markets \u2014 which is exactly the place where
p264
aVSARS emerged in Asia.
p265
aVBut really, this is just the beginning from our perspective.
p266
aa(lp267
VOur objective right now, in addition to
p268
aVdeploying to these sites and getting everything moving,
p269
aVis to identify new partners
p270
aVbecause we feel like this effort needs to be extended
p271
aVto probably 20 or more sites throughout the world \u2014 to viral hotspots \u2014
p272
aVbecause really the idea here is to cast an incredibly wide net
p273
aVso that we can catch these things, ideally,
p274
aVbefore they make it to blood banks,
p275
aVsexual networks, airplanes. And that's really our objective.
p276
aVThere was a time not very long ago
p277
aVwhen the discovery of unknown organisms
p278
aVwas something that held incredible awe for us.
p279
aVIt had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves,
p280
aVand thought about ourselves.
p281
aa(lp282
VMany people, I think, on our planet right now
p283
aVdespair, and they think
p284
aVwe've reached a point where we've discovered most of the things.
p285
aVI'm going tell you right now: please don't despair.
p286
aVIf an intelligent extra-terrestrial
p287
aVwas taxed with writing the encyclopedia of life on our planet,
p288
aV27 out of 30 of these volumes
p289
aVwould be devoted to bacteria and virus,
p290
aVwith just a few of the volumes left
p291
aVfor plants, fungus and animals,
p292
aVhumans being a footnote;
p293
aVinteresting footnote but a footnote nonetheless.
p294
aVThis is honestly the most exciting period
p295
aVever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet.
p296
aVThe dominant things that exist here
p297
aVwe know almost nothing about.
p298
aVAnd yet finally, we have the tools, which will allow us to actually explore that world
p299
aVand understand them.
