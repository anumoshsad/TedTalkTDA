VHi. This is my mobile phone.
p4
aVA mobile phone can change your life,
p5
aVand a mobile phone gives you individual freedom.
p6
aVWith a mobile phone,
p7
aVyou can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria.
p8
aVWith a mobile phone,
p9
aVyou can tweet a message
p10
aVand start a protest in Egypt.
p11
aVAnd with a mobile phone,
p12
aVyou can record a song, load it up to
p13
aVSoundCloud and become famous.
p14
aVAll this is possible with your mobile phone.
p15
aa(lp16
VI'm a child of 1984,
p17
aVand I live in the city of Berlin.
p18
aVLet's go back to that time, to this city.
p19
aVHere you can see
p20
aVhow hundreds of thousands of people
p21
aVstood up and protested for change.
p22
aVThis is autumn 1989,
p23
aVand imagine that all those people standing up
p24
aVand protesting for change had a
p25
aVmobile phone in their pocket.
p26
aa(lp27
VWho in the room has a mobile phone with you?
p28
aVHold it up.
p29
aVHold your phones up, hold your phones up!
p30
aVHold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
p31
aVThat's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile phone.
p32
aa(lp33
VBut today I will talk about me and my mobile phone,
p34
aVand how it changed my life.
p35
aVAnd I will talk about this.
p36
aVThese are 35,830 lines of information.
p37
aVRaw data.
p38
aVAnd why are these informations there?
p39
aVBecause in the summer of 2006,
p40
aVthe E.U. Commission tabled a directive.
p41
aa(lp42
VThis directive [is] called Data Retention Directive.
p43
aVThis directive says that each phone company in Europe,
p44
aVeach Internet service company all over Europe,
p45
aVhas to store a wide range of information about the users.
p46
aVWho calls whom? Who sends whom an email?
p47
aVWho sends whom a text message?
p48
aVAnd if you use your mobile phone, where you are.
p49
aVAll this information is stored for at least six months,
p50
aVup to two years by your phone company
p51
aVor your Internet service provider.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd all over Europe, people stood up and said,
p54
aV"We don't want this."
p55
aVThey said, we don't want this data retention.
p56
aVWe want self-determination in the digital age,
p57
aVand we don't want that phone companies and Internet companies
p58
aVhave to store all this information about us.
p59
aVThey were lawyers, journalists, priests,
p60
aVthey all said: "We don't want this."
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd here you can see, like 10 thousands of people
p63
aVwent out on the streets of Berlin and said,
p64
aV"Freedom, not fear."
p65
aVAnd some even said, this would be Stasi 2.0.
p66
aVStasi was the secret police in East Germany.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd I also ask myself, does it really work?
p69
aVCan they really store all this information about us?
p70
aVEvery time I use my mobile phone?
p71
aVSo I asked my phone company, Deutsche Telekom,
p72
aVwhich was at that time the largest phone company in Germany,
p73
aVand I asked them, please,
p74
aVsend me all the information you have stored about me.
p75
aVAnd I asked them once, and I asked them again,
p76
aVand I got no real answer. It was only blah blah answers.
p77
aa(lp78
VBut then I said, I want to have this information,
p79
aVbecause this is my life you are protocoling.
p80
aVSo I decided to start a lawsuit against them,
p81
aVbecause I wanted to have this information.
p82
aVBut Deutsche Telekom said, no,
p83
aVwe will not give you this information.
p84
aVSo at the end, I had a settlement with them.
p85
aVI'll put down the lawsuit
p86
aVand they will send me all the information I ask for.
p87
aVBecause in the mean time,
p88
aVthe German Constitutional Court ruled
p89
aVthat the implementation of this E.U. directive
p90
aVinto German law was unconstitutional.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo I got this ugly brown envelope
p93
aVwith a C.D. inside.
p94
aVAnd on the C.D., this was on.
p95
aVThirty-five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information.
p96
aVAt first I saw it, and I said, okay,
p97
aVit's a huge file. Okay.
p98
aVBut then after a while I realized,
p99
aVthis is my life.
p100
aVThis is six months of my life,
p101
aVinto this file.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo I was a little bit skeptical, what should I do with it?
p104
aVBecause you can see where I am,
p105
aVwhere I sleep at night,
p106
aVwhat I am doing.
p107
aVBut then I said, I want to go out with this information.
p108
aVI want to make them public.
p109
aVBecause I want to show the people what does data retention mean.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo together with Zeit Online and Open Data City, I did this.
p112
aVThis is a visualization of six months of my life.
p113
aVYou can zoom in and zoom out,
p114
aVyou can wind back and fast forward.
p115
aVYou can see every step I take.
p116
aVAnd you can even see
p117
aVhow I go from Frankfurt by train
p118
aVto Cologne, and how often I call in between.
p119
aa(lp120
VAll this is possible with this information.
p121
aVThat's a little bit scary.
p122
aVBut it is not only about me.
p123
aVIt's about all of us.
p124
aVFirst, it's only like, I call my wife and she calls me,
p125
aVand we talk to each other a couple of times.
p126
aVAnd then there are some friends calling me,
p127
aVand they call each other.
p128
aVAnd after a while you are calling you,
p129
aVand you are calling you, and you have this great
p130
aVcommunication network.
p131
aa(lp132
VBut you can see how your people are communicating with each other,
p133
aVwhat times they call each other, when they go to bed.
p134
aVYou can see all of this.
p135
aVYou can see the hubs, like who are the leaders in the group.
p136
aVIf you have access to this information,
p137
aVyou can see what your society is doing.
p138
aVIf you have access to this information,
p139
aVyou can control your society.
p140
aa(lp141
VThis is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
p142
aVThis is a blueprint how to survey your society,
p143
aVbecause you know who talks to whom,
p144
aVwho sends whom an email, all this is possible
p145
aVif you have access to this information.
p146
aVAnd this information is stored for at least six months
p147
aVin Europe, up to two years.
p148
aa(lp149
VLike I said at the beginning,
p150
aVimagine that all those people on the streets of Berlin
p151
aVin autumn of 1989
p152
aVhad a mobile phone in their pocket.
p153
aVAnd the Stasi would have known who took part at this protest,
p154
aVand if the Stasi would have known
p155
aVwho are the leaders behind it,
p156
aVthis may never have happened.
p157
aVThe fall of the Berlin Wall would maybe not [have been] there.
p158
aVAnd in the aftermath, also not the fall of the Iron Curtain.
p159
aVBecause today, state agencies and companies
p160
aVwant to store as much information as they can get about us,
p161
aVonline and offline.
p162
aVThey want to have the possibility to track our lives,
p163
aVand they want to store them for all time.
p164
aa(lp165
VBut self-determination and living in the digital age
p166
aVis no contradiction.
p167
aVBut you have to fight for your self-determination today.
p168
aVYou have to fight for it every day.
p169
aVSo, when you go home,
p170
aVtell your friends
p171
aVthat privacy is a value of the 21st century,
p172
aVand it's not outdated.
p173
aVWhen you go home, tell your representative
p174
aVonly because companies and state agencies have the possibility
p175
aVto store certain information, they don't have to do it.
p176
aVAnd if you don't believe me,
p177
aVask your phone company what information they store about you.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo, in the future, every time you use your mobile phone,
p180
aVlet it be a reminder to you
p181
aVthat you have to fight for self-determination in the digital age.
p182
aVThank you.
