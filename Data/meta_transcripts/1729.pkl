VI'm not sure that every person here
p4
aVis familiar with my pictures.
p5
aVI want to start to show just a few pictures to you,
p6
aVand after I'll speak.
p7
aa(lp8
VI must speak to you a little bit of my history,
p9
aVbecause we'll be speaking on this
p10
aVduring my speech here.
p11
aVI was born in 1944 in Brazil,
p12
aVin the times that Brazil was not yet a market economy.
p13
aVI was born on a farm,
p14
aVa farm that was more than 50 percent rainforest [still].
p15
aVA marvelous place.
p16
aVI lived with incredible birds, incredible animals,
p17
aVI swam in our small rivers with our caimans.
p18
aVIt was about 35 families that lived on this farm,
p19
aVand everything that we produced on this farm, we consumed.
p20
aVVery few things went to the market.
p21
aVOnce a year, the only thing that went to the market
p22
aVwas the cattle that we produced,
p23
aVand we made trips of about 45 days
p24
aVto reach the slaughterhouse,
p25
aVbringing thousands of head of cattle,
p26
aVand about 20 days traveling back
p27
aVto reach our farm again.
p28
aa(lp29
VWhen I was 15 years old,
p30
aVit was necessary for me to leave this place
p31
aVand go to a town a little bit bigger \u2014 much bigger \u2014
p32
aVwhere I did the second part of secondary school.
p33
aVThere I learned different things.
p34
aVBrazil was starting to urbanize, industrialize,
p35
aVand I knew the politics. I became a little bit radical,
p36
aVI was a member of leftist parties,
p37
aVand I became an activist.
p38
aVI [went to] university to become an economist.
p39
aVI [did] a master's degree in economics.
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd the most important thing in my life
p42
aValso happened in this time.
p43
aVI met an incredible girl
p44
aVwho became my lifelong best friend,
p45
aVand my associate in everything that I have done till now,
p46
aVmy wife, Lélia Wanick Salgado.
p47
aa(lp48
VBrazil radicalized very strongly.
p49
aVWe fought very hard against the dictatorship,
p50
aVin a moment it was necessary to us:
p51
aVEither go into clandestinity with weapons in hand,
p52
aVor leave Brazil. We were too young,
p53
aVand our organization thought it was better for us to go out,
p54
aVand we went to France,
p55
aVwhere I did a PhD in economics,
p56
aVLéila became an architect.
p57
aVI worked after for an investment bank.
p58
aVWe made a lot of trips, financed development,
p59
aVeconomic projects in Africa with the World Bank.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd one day photography made a total invasion in my life.
p62
aVI became a photographer,
p63
aVabandoned everything and became a photographer,
p64
aVand I started to do the photography
p65
aVthat was important for me.
p66
aVMany people tell me that you are a photojournalist,
p67
aVthat you are an anthropologist photographer,
p68
aVthat you are an activist photographer.
p69
aVBut I did much more than that.
p70
aVI put photography as my life.
p71
aVI lived totally inside photography
p72
aVdoing long term projects,
p73
aVand I want to show you just a few pictures
p74
aVof \u2014 again, you'll see inside the social projects,
p75
aVthat I went to, I published many books
p76
aVon these photographs,
p77
aVbut I'll just show you a few ones now.
p78
aa(lp79
VIn the '90s, from 1994 to 2000,
p80
aVI photographed a story called Migrations.
p81
aVIt became a book. It became a show.
p82
aa(lp83
VBut during the time that I was photographing this,
p84
aVI lived through a very hard moment in my life, mostly in Rwanda.
p85
aVI saw in Rwanda total brutality.
p86
aVI saw deaths by thousands per day.
p87
aVI lost my faith in our species.
p88
aVI didn't believe that it was possible for us to live any longer,
p89
aVand I started to be attacked by my own Staphylococcus.
p90
aVI started to have infection everywhere.
p91
aVWhen I made love with my wife, I had no sperm that came out of me;
p92
aVI had blood.
p93
aVI went to see a friend's doctor in Paris,
p94
aVtold him that I was completely sick.
p95
aVHe made a long examination, and told me, "Sebastian,
p96
aVyou are not sick, your prostate is perfect.
p97
aVWhat happened is, you saw so many deaths that you are dying.
p98
aVYou must stop. Stop.
p99
aVYou must stop because on the contrary, you will be dead."
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd I made the decision to stop.
p102
aVI was really upset with photography,
p103
aVwith everything in the world,
p104
aVand I made the decision to go back to where I was born.
p105
aVIt was a big coincidence.
p106
aVIt was the moment that my parents became very old.
p107
aVI have seven sisters. I'm one of the only men in my family,
p108
aVand they made together the decision
p109
aVto transfer this land to Léila and myself.
p110
aVWhen we received this land, this land was as dead as I was.
p111
aVWhen I was a kid, it was more than 50 percent rainforest.
p112
aVWhen we received the land,
p113
aVit was less than half a percent rainforest,
p114
aVas in all my region.
p115
aVTo build development, Brazilian development,
p116
aVwe destroyed a lot of our forest.
p117
aVAs you did here in the United States,
p118
aVor you did in India, everywhere in this planet.
p119
aVTo build our development,
p120
aVwe come to a huge contradiction
p121
aVthat we destroy around us everything.
p122
aVThis farm that had thousands of head of cattle
p123
aVhad just a few hundreds,
p124
aVand we didn't know how to deal with these.
p125
aVAnd Léila came up with an incredible idea, a crazy idea.
p126
aa(lp127
VShe said, why don't you put back the rainforest that was here before?
p128
aVYou say that you were born in paradise.
p129
aVLet's build the paradise again.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd I went to see a good friend
p132
aVthat was engineering forests
p133
aVto prepare a project for us,
p134
aVand we started. We started to plant, and this
p135
aVfirst year we lost a lot of trees, second year less,
p136
aVand slowly, slowly this dead land started to be born again.
p137
aVWe started to plant hundreds of thousands of trees,
p138
aVonly local species, only native species,
p139
aVwhere we built an ecosystem identical to the one that was destroyed,
p140
aVand the life started to come back in an incredible way.
p141
aVIt was necessary for us to transform our land
p142
aVinto a national park.
p143
aVWe transformed. We gave this land back to nature.
p144
aVIt became a national park.
p145
aVWe created an institution called Instituto Terra,
p146
aVand we built a big environmental project to raise money everywhere.
p147
aVHere in Los Angeles, in the Bay Area in San Francisco,
p148
aVit became tax deductible in the United States.
p149
aVWe raised money in Spain, in Italy, a lot in Brazil.
p150
aVWe worked with a lot of companies in Brazil
p151
aVthat put money into this project, the government.
p152
aVAnd the life started to come, and I had a big wish
p153
aVto come back to photography, to photograph again.
p154
aVAnd this time, my wish was not to photograph anymore
p155
aVjust one animal that I had photographed all my life: us.
p156
aVI wished to photograph the other animals,
p157
aVto photograph the landscapes,
p158
aVto photograph us, but us from the beginning,
p159
aVthe time we lived in equilibrium with nature.
p160
aVAnd I went. I started in the beginning of 2004,
p161
aVand I finished at the end of 2011.
p162
aVWe created an incredible amount of pictures,
p163
aVand the result \u2014 Lélia did the design of all my books,
p164
aVthe design of all my shows. She is the creator of the shows.
p165
aVAnd what we want with these pictures
p166
aVis to create a discussion about what we have that is pristine on the planet
p167
aVand what we must hold on this planet
p168
aVif we want to live, to have some equilibrium in our life.
p169
aVAnd I wanted to see us
p170
aVwhen we used, yes, our instruments in stone.
p171
aVWe exist yet. I was last week
p172
aVat the Brazilian National Indian Foundation,
p173
aVand only in the Amazon we have about 110 groups
p174
aVof Indians that are not contacted yet.
p175
aVWe must protect the forest in this sense.
p176
aVAnd with these pictures, I hope that we can create
p177
aVinformation, a system of information.
p178
aVWe tried to do a new presentation of the planet,
p179
aVand I want to show you now just a few pictures
p180
aVof this project, please.
p181
aa(lp182
VWell, this \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p183
aVThank you. Thank you very much.
p184
aa(lp185
VThis is what we must fight hard
p186
aVto hold like it is now.
p187
aVBut there is another part that we must together rebuild,
p188
aVto build our societies, our modern family of societies,
p189
aVwe are at a point where we cannot go back.
p190
aVBut we create an incredible contradiction.
p191
aVTo build all this, we destroy a lot.
p192
aVOur forest in Brazil, that antique forest
p193
aVthat was the size of California,
p194
aVis destroyed today 93 percent.
p195
aVHere, on the West Coast, you've destroyed your forest.
p196
aVAround here, no? The redwood forests are gone.
p197
aVGone very fast, disappeared.
p198
aVComing the other day from Atlanta, here, two days ago,
p199
aVI was flying over deserts
p200
aVthat we made, we provoked with our own hands.
p201
aVIndia has no more trees. Spain has no more trees.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd we must rebuild these forests.
p204
aVThat is the essence of our life, these forests.
p205
aVWe need to breathe. The only factory
p206
aVcapable to transform CO2 into oxygen,
p207
aVare the forests.
p208
aVThe only machine capable to capture the carbon
p209
aVthat we are producing, always,
p210
aVeven if we reduce them, everything that we do, we produce CO2,
p211
aVare the trees.
p212
aVI put the question \u2014 three or four weeks ago,
p213
aVwe saw in the newspapers
p214
aVmillions of fish that die in Norway.
p215
aVA lack of oxygen in the water.
p216
aVI put to myself the question, if for a moment,
p217
aVwe will not lack oxygen for all animal species,
p218
aVours included \u2014 that would be very complicated for us.
p219
aa(lp220
VFor the water system, the trees are essential.
p221
aVI'll give you a small example that you'll understand very easily.
p222
aVYou happy people that have a lot of hair on your head,
p223
aVif you take a shower, it takes you
p224
aVtwo or three hours to dry your hair
p225
aVif you don't use a dryer machine.
p226
aVMe, one minute, it's dry. The same with the trees.
p227
aVThe trees are the hair of our planet.
p228
aVWhen you have rain in a place that has no trees,
p229
aVin just a few minutes, the water arrives in the stream,
p230
aVbrings soil, destroying our water source,
p231
aVdestroying the rivers,
p232
aVand no humidity to retain.
p233
aVWhen you have trees, the root system holds the water.
p234
aVAll the branches of the trees, the leaves that come down
p235
aVcreate a humid area,
p236
aVand they take months and months under the water, go to the rivers,
p237
aVand maintain our source, maintain our rivers.
p238
aVThis is the most important thing,
p239
aVwhen we imagine that we need water for every activity in life.
p240
aa(lp241
VI want to show you now, to finish,
p242
aVjust a few pictures that for me
p243
aVare very important in that direction.
p244
aVYou remember that I told you,
p245
aVwhen I received the farm from my parents
p246
aVthat was my paradise, that was the farm.
p247
aVLand completely destroyed, the erosion there, the land had dried.
p248
aVBut you can see in this picture,
p249
aVwe were starting to construct an educational center
p250
aVthat became quite a large environmental center in Brazil.
p251
aVBut you see a lot of small spots in this picture.
p252
aVIn each point of those spots, we had planted a tree.
p253
aVThere are thousands of trees.
p254
aVNow I'll show you the pictures made exactly in the same point
p255
aVtwo months ago.
p256
aa(lp257
V(Applause)
p258
aa(lp259
VI told you in the beginning that it was necessary
p260
aVfor us to plant about 2.5 million trees
p261
aVof about 200 different species
p262
aVin order to rebuild the ecosystem.
p263
aVAnd I'll show you the last picture.
p264
aVWe are with two million trees in the ground now.
p265
aVWe are doing the sequestration
p266
aVof about 100,000 tons of carbon with these trees.
p267
aa(lp268
VMy friends, it's very easy to do. We did it, no?
p269
aVBy an accident that happened to me,
p270
aVwe went back, we built an ecosystem.
p271
aVWe here inside the room,
p272
aVI believe that we have the same concern,
p273
aVand the model that we created in Brazil,
p274
aVwe can transplant it here.
p275
aVWe can apply it everywhere around the world, no?
p276
aVAnd I believe that we can do it together.
p277
aa(lp278
VThank you very much.
