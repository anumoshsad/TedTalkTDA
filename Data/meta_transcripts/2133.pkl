(lp3
VThey told me that I'm a traitor to my own profession,
p4
aVthat I should be fired,
p5
aVhave my medical license taken away,
p6
aVthat I should go back to my own country.
p7
aVMy email got hacked.
p8
aVIn a discussion forum for other doctors,
p9
aVsomeone took credit for "Twitter-bombing" my account.
p10
aVNow, I didn't know if this was a good or bad thing,
p11
aVbut then came the response:
p12
aV"Too bad it wasn't a real bomb."
p13
aa(lp14
VI never thought that I would do something
p15
aVthat would provoke this level of anger among other doctors.
p16
aVBecoming a doctor was my dream.
p17
aVI grew up in China,
p18
aVand my earliest memories are of being rushed to the hospital
p19
aVbecause I had such bad asthma that I was there nearly every week.
p20
aVI had this one doctor, Dr. Sam, who always took care of me.
p21
aVShe was about the same age as my mother.
p22
aVShe had this wild, curly hair,
p23
aVand she always wore these bright yellow flowery dresses.
p24
aVShe was one of those doctors who,
p25
aVif you fell and you broke your arm,
p26
aVshe would ask you why you weren't laughing
p27
aVbecause it's your humerus. Get it?
p28
aVSee, you'd groan,
p29
aVbut she'd always make you feel better after having seen her.
p30
aVWell, we all have that childhood hero
p31
aVthat we want to grow up to be just like, right?
p32
aVWell, I wanted to be just like Dr. Sam.
p33
aVWhen I was eight, my parents and I moved to the U.S.,
p34
aVand ours became the typical immigrant narrative.
p35
aVMy parents cleaned hotel rooms and washed dishes and pumped gas
p36
aVso that I could pursue my dream.
p37
aVWell, eventually I learned enough English,
p38
aVand my parents were so happy
p39
aVthe day that I got into medical school and took my oath of healing and service.
p40
aa(lp41
VBut then one day, everything changed.
p42
aVMy mother called me to tell me that she wasn't feeling well,
p43
aVshe had a cough that wouldn't go away, she was short of breath and tired.
p44
aVWell, I knew that my mother was someone who never complained about anything.
p45
aVFor her to tell me that something was the matter,
p46
aVI knew something had to be really wrong.
p47
aVAnd it was:
p48
aVWe found out that she had stage IV breast cancer,
p49
aVcancer that by then had spread to her lungs, her bones, and her brain.
p50
aVMy mother was brave, though, and she had hope.
p51
aVShe went through surgery and radiation,
p52
aVand was on her third round of chemotherapy
p53
aVwhen she lost her address book.
p54
aVShe tried to look up her oncologist's phone number on the Internet
p55
aVand she found it, but she found something else too.
p56
aVOn several websites,
p57
aVhe was listed as a highly paid speaker to a drug company,
p58
aVand in fact often spoke on behalf
p59
aVof the same chemo regimen that he had prescribed her.
p60
aVShe called me in a panic,
p61
aVand I didn't know what to believe.
p62
aVMaybe this was the right chemo regimen for her,
p63
aVbut maybe it wasn't.
p64
aVIt made her scared and it made her doubt.
p65
aVWhen it comes to medicine,
p66
aVhaving that trust is a must,
p67
aVand when that trust is gone, then all that's left is fear.
p68
aa(lp69
VThere's another side to this fear.
p70
aVAs a medical student, I was taking care of this 19-year-old
p71
aVwho was biking back to his dorm
p72
aVwhen he got struck and hit,
p73
aVrun over by an SUV.
p74
aVHe had seven broken ribs,
p75
aVshattered hip bones,
p76
aVand he was bleeding inside his belly and inside his brain.
p77
aVNow, imagine being his parents
p78
aVwho flew in from Seattle, 2,000 miles away,
p79
aVto find their son in a coma.
p80
aVI mean, you'd want to find out what's going on with him, right?
p81
aVThey asked to attend our bedside rounds
p82
aVwhere we discussed his condition and his plan,
p83
aVwhich I thought was a reasonable request,
p84
aVand also would give us a chance to show them
p85
aVhow much we were trying and how much we cared.
p86
aVThe head doctor, though, said no.
p87
aVHe gave all kinds of reasons.
p88
aVMaybe they'll get in the nurse's way.
p89
aVMaybe they'll stop students from asking questions.
p90
aVHe even said,
p91
aV"What if they see mistakes and sue us?"
p92
aVWhat I saw behind every excuse was deep fear,
p93
aVand what I learned was that to become a doctor,
p94
aVwe have to put on our white coats,
p95
aVput up a wall, and hide behind it.
p96
aVThere's a hidden epidemic in medicine.
p97
aVOf course, patients are scared when they come to the doctor.
p98
aVImagine you wake up with this terrible bellyache,
p99
aVyou go to the hospital,
p100
aVyou're lying in this strange place, you're on this hospital gurney,
p101
aVyou're wearing this flimsy gown,
p102
aVstrangers are coming to poke and prod at you.
p103
aVYou don't know what's going to happen.
p104
aVYou don't even know if you're going to get the blanket you asked for 30 minutes ago.
p105
aVBut it's not just patients who are scared;
p106
aVdoctors are scared too.
p107
aVWe're scared of patients finding out who we are
p108
aVand what medicine is all about.
p109
aVAnd so what do we do?
p110
aVWe put on our white coats and we hide behind them.
p111
aVOf course, the more we hide,
p112
aVthe more people want to know what it is that we're hiding.
p113
aVThe more fear then spirals into mistrust and poor medical care.
p114
aVWe don't just have a fear of sickness,
p115
aVwe have a sickness of fear.
p116
aa(lp117
VCan we bridge this disconnect
p118
aVbetween what patients need and what doctors do?
p119
aVCan we overcome the sickness of fear?
p120
aVLet me ask you differently:
p121
aVIf hiding isn't the answer, what if we did the opposite?
p122
aVWhat if doctors were to become totally transparent with their patients?
p123
aa(lp124
VLast fall, I conducted a research study to find out
p125
aVwhat it is that people want to know about their healthcare.
p126
aVI didn't just want to study patients in a hospital,
p127
aVbut everyday people.
p128
aVSo my two medical students, Suhavi Tucker and Laura Johns,
p129
aVliterally took their research to the streets.
p130
aVThey went to banks, coffee shops, senior centers,
p131
aVChinese restaurants and train stations.
p132
aVWhat did they find?
p133
aVWell, when we asked people,
p134
aV"What do you want to know about your healthcare?"
p135
aVpeople responded with what they want to know about their doctors,
p136
aVbecause people understand health care
p137
aVto be the individual interaction between them and their doctors.
p138
aVWhen we asked, "What do you want to know about your doctors?"
p139
aVpeople gave three different answers.
p140
aVSome want to know that their doctor is competent
p141
aVand certified to practice medicine.
p142
aVSome want to be sure that their doctor is unbiased
p143
aVand is making decisions based on evidence and science,
p144
aVnot on who pays them.
p145
aVSurprisingly to us,
p146
aVmany people want to know something else about their doctors.
p147
aVJonathan, a 28-year-old law student,
p148
aVsays he wants to find someone who is comfortable with LGBTQ patients
p149
aVand specializes in LGBT health.
p150
aVSerena, a 32-year-old accountant,
p151
aVsays that it's important to her for her doctor to share her values
p152
aVwhen it comes to reproductive choice and women's rights.
p153
aVFrank, a 59-year-old hardware store owner,
p154
aVdoesn't even like going to the doctor
p155
aVand wants to find someone who believes in prevention first,
p156
aVbut who is comfortable with alternative treatments.
p157
aVOne after another, our respondents told us
p158
aVthat that doctor-patient relationship is a deeply intimate one \u2014
p159
aVthat to show their doctors their bodies
p160
aVand tell them their deepest secrets,
p161
aVthey want to first understand their doctor's values.
p162
aVJust because doctors have to see every patient
p163
aVdoesn't mean that patients have to see every doctor.
p164
aVPeople want to know about their doctors first
p165
aVso that they can make an informed choice.
p166
aa(lp167
VAs a result of this, I formed a campaign,
p168
aVWho's My Doctor?
p169
aVthat calls for total transparency in medicine.
p170
aVParticipating doctors voluntarily disclose
p171
aVon a public website
p172
aVnot just information about where we went to medical school
p173
aVand what specialty we're in,
p174
aVbut also our conflicts of interest.
p175
aVWe go beyond the Government in the Sunshine Act
p176
aVabout drug company affiliations,
p177
aVand we talk about how we're paid.
p178
aVIncentives matter.
p179
aVIf you go to your doctor because of back pain,
p180
aVyou might want to know he's getting paid 5,000 dollars to perform spine surgery
p181
aVversus 25 dollars to refer you to see a physical therapist,
p182
aVor if he's getting paid the same thing no matter what he recommends.
p183
aVThen, we go one step further.
p184
aVWe add our values when it comes to women's health,
p185
aVLGBT health, alternative medicine,
p186
aVpreventive health, and end-of-life decisions.
p187
aVWe pledge to our patients that we are here to serve you,
p188
aVso you have a right to know who we are.
p189
aVWe believe that transparency can be the cure for fear.
p190
aa(lp191
VI thought some doctors would sign on and others wouldn't,
p192
aVbut I had no idea of the huge backlash that would ensue.
p193
aVWithin one week of starting Who's My Doctor?
p194
aVMedscape's public forum
p195
aVand several online doctors' communities
p196
aVhad thousands of posts about this topic.
p197
aVHere are a few.
p198
aa(lp199
VFrom a gastroenterologist in Portland:
p200
aV"I devoted 12 years of my life to being a slave.
p201
aVI have loans and mortgages.
p202
aVI depend on lunches from drug companies to serve patients."
p203
aVWell, times may be hard for everyone,
p204
aVbut try telling your patient
p205
aVmaking 35,000 dollars a year to serve a family of four
p206
aVthat you need the free lunch.
p207
aa(lp208
VFrom an orthopedic surgeon in Charlotte:
p209
aV"I find it an invasion of my privacy to disclose where my income comes from.
p210
aVMy patients don't disclose their incomes to me."
p211
aVBut your patients' sources of income don't affect your health.
p212
aa(lp213
VFrom a psychiatrist in New York City:
p214
aV"Pretty soon we will have to disclose whether we prefer cats to dogs,
p215
aVwhat model of car we drive,
p216
aVand what toilet paper we use."
p217
aVWell, how you feel about Toyotas or Cottonelle
p218
aVwon't affect your patients' health,
p219
aVbut your views on a woman's right to choose
p220
aVand preventive medicine and end-of-life decisions just might.
p221
aVAnd my favorite, from a Kansas City cardiologist:
p222
aV"More government-mandated stuff?
p223
aVDr. Wen needs to move back to her own country."
p224
aVWell, two pieces of good news.
p225
aVFirst of all, this is meant to be voluntary and not mandatory,
p226
aVand second of all, I'm American and I'm already here.
p227
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p228
aa(lp229
VWithin a month, my employers were getting calls
p230
aVasking for me to be fired.
p231
aVI received mail at my undisclosed home address
p232
aVwith threats to contact the medical board to sanction me.
p233
aVMy friends and family urged me to quit this campaign.
p234
aVAfter the bomb threat, I was done.
p235
aVBut then I heard from patients.
p236
aVOver social media, a TweetChat,
p237
aVwhich I'd learned what that was by then,
p238
aVgenerated 4.3 million impressions,
p239
aVand thousands of people wrote to encourage me to continue.
p240
aVThey wrote with things like,
p241
aV"If doctors are doing something they're that ashamed of,
p242
aVthey shouldn't be doing it."
p243
aV"Elected officials have to disclose campaign contributions.
p244
aVLawyers have to disclose conflicts of interests.
p245
aVWhy shouldn't doctors?"
p246
aVAnd finally, many people wrote and said,
p247
aV"Let us patients decide
p248
aVwhat's important when we're choosing a doctor."
p249
aVIn our initial trial,
p250
aVover 300 doctors have taken the total transparency pledge.
p251
aVWhat a crazy new idea, right?
p252
aVBut actually, this is not that new of a concept at all.
p253
aVRemember Dr. Sam, my doctor in China,
p254
aVwith the goofy jokes and the wild hair?
p255
aVWell, she was my doctor,
p256
aVbut she was also our neighbor
p257
aVwho lived in the building across the street.
p258
aVI went to the same school as her daughter.
p259
aVMy parents and I trusted her
p260
aVbecause we knew who she was and what she stood for,
p261
aVand she had no need to hide from us.
p262
aVJust one generation ago, this was the norm in the U.S. as well.
p263
aVYou knew that your family doctor was the father of two teenage boys,
p264
aVthat he quit smoking a few years ago,
p265
aVthat he says he's a regular churchgoer,
p266
aVbut you see him twice a year: once at Easter
p267
aVand once when his mother-in-law comes to town.
p268
aVYou knew what he was about,
p269
aVand he had no need to hide from you.
p270
aVBut the sickness of fear has taken over,
p271
aVand patients suffer the consequences.
p272
aa(lp273
VI know this firsthand.
p274
aVMy mother fought her cancer for eight years.
p275
aVShe was a planner,
p276
aVand she thought a lot about how she wanted to live
p277
aVand how she wanted to die.
p278
aVNot only did she sign advance directives,
p279
aVshe wrote a 12-page document about how she had suffered enough,
p280
aVhow it was time for her to go.
p281
aVOne day, when I was a resident physician,
p282
aVI got a call to say that she was in the intensive care unit.
p283
aVBy the time I got there, she was about to be intubated
p284
aVand put on a breathing machine.
p285
aV"But this is not what she wants," I said, "and we have documents."
p286
aVThe ICU doctor looked at me in the eye,
p287
aVpointed at my then 16-year-old sister, and said,
p288
aV"Do you remember when you were that age?
p289
aVHow would you have liked to grow up without your mother?"
p290
aVHer oncologist was there too, and said,
p291
aV"This is your mother.
p292
aVCan you really face yourself for the rest of your life
p293
aVif you don't do everything for her?"
p294
aVI knew my mother so well.
p295
aVI understood what her directives meant so well,
p296
aVbut I was a physician.
p297
aVThat was the single hardest decision I ever made,
p298
aVto let her die in peace,
p299
aVand I carry those words of those doctors with me
p300
aVevery single day.
p301
aa(lp302
VWe can bridge the disconnect
p303
aVbetween what doctors do and what patients need.
p304
aVWe can get there, because we've been there before,
p305
aVand we know that transparency gets us to that trust.
p306
aVResearch has shown us that openness also helps doctors,
p307
aVthat having open medical records,
p308
aVbeing willing to talk about medical errors,
p309
aVwill increase patient trust,
p310
aVimprove health outcomes,
p311
aVand reduce malpractice.
p312
aVThat openness, that trust,
p313
aVis only going to be more important
p314
aVas we move from the infectious to the behavioral model of disease.
p315
aVBacteria may not care so much about trust and intimacy,
p316
aVbut for people to tackle the hard lifestyle choices,
p317
aVto address issues like smoking cessation,
p318
aVblood-pressure management and diabetes control,
p319
aVwell, that requires us to establish trust.
p320
aa(lp321
VHere's what other transparent doctors have said.
p322
aa(lp323
VBrandon Combs, an internist in Denver:
p324
aV"This has brought me closer to my patients.
p325
aVThe type of relationship I've developed \u2014
p326
aVthat's why I entered medicine."
p327
aa(lp328
VAaron Stupple, an internist in Denver:
p329
aV"I tell my patients that I am totally open with them.
p330
aVI don't hide anything from them.
p331
aVThis is me. Now tell me about you.
p332
aVWe're in this together."
p333
aa(lp334
VMay Nguyen, a family physician in Houston:
p335
aV"My colleagues are astounded by what I'm doing.
p336
aVThey ask me how I could be so brave.
p337
aVI said, I'm not being brave,
p338
aVit's my job."
p339
aa(lp340
VI leave you today with a final thought.
p341
aVBeing totally transparent is scary.
p342
aVYou feel naked, exposed and vulnerable,
p343
aVbut that vulnerability, that humility,
p344
aVit can be an extraordinary benefit to the practice of medicine.
p345
aVWhen doctors are willing to step off our pedestals,
p346
aVtake off our white coats,
p347
aVand show our patients who we are and what medicine is all about,
p348
aVthat's when we begin to overcome the sickness of fear.
p349
aVThat's when we establish trust.
p350
aVThat's when we change the paradigm of medicine
p351
aVfrom one of secrecy and hiding
p352
aVto one that is fully open and engaged
p353
aVfor our patients.
p354
