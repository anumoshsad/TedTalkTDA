V[His Holiness Pope Francis Filmed in Vatican City
p4
aVFirst shown at TED2017]
p5
aa(lp6
VGood evening \u2013 or, good morning, I am not sure what time it is there.
p7
aVRegardless of the hour, I am thrilled to be participating in your conference.
p8
aVI very much like its title \u2013 "The Future You" \u2013
p9
aVbecause, while looking at tomorrow, it invites us to open a dialogue today,
p10
aVto look at the future through a "you."
p11
aV"The Future You:"
p12
aVthe future is made of yous, it is made of encounters,
p13
aVbecause life flows through our relations with others.
p14
aVQuite a few years of life
p15
aVhave strengthened my conviction
p16
aVthat each and everyone's existence is deeply tied to that of others:
p17
aVlife is not time merely passing by, life is about interactions.
p18
aa(lp19
VAs I meet, or lend an ear to those who are sick,
p20
aVto the migrants who face terrible hardships
p21
aVin search of a brighter future,
p22
aVto prison inmates who carry a hell of pain inside their hearts,
p23
aVand to those, many of them young, who cannot find a job,
p24
aVI often find myself wondering:
p25
aV"Why them and not me?"
p26
aVI, myself, was born in a family of migrants;
p27
aVmy father, my grandparents, like many other Italians,
p28
aVleft for Argentina
p29
aVand met the fate of those who are left with nothing.
p30
aVI could have very well ended up among today's "discarded" people.
p31
aVAnd that's why I always ask myself, deep in my heart:
p32
aV"Why them and not me?"
p33
aa(lp34
VFirst and foremost, I would love it if this meeting could help to remind us
p35
aVthat we all need each other,
p36
aVnone of us is an island,
p37
aVan autonomous and independent "I," separated from the other,
p38
aVand we can only build the future by standing together, including everyone.
p39
aVWe don\u2019t think about it often, but everything is connected,
p40
aVand we need to restore our connections to a healthy state.
p41
aVEven the harsh judgment I hold in my heart
p42
aVagainst my brother or my sister,
p43
aVthe open wound that was never cured, the offense that was never forgiven,
p44
aVthe rancor that is only going to hurt me,
p45
aVare all instances of a fight that I carry within me,
p46
aVa flare deep in my heart that needs to be extinguished
p47
aVbefore it goes up in flames, leaving only ashes behind.
p48
aa(lp49
VMany of us, nowadays,
p50
aVseem to believe that a happy future is something impossible to achieve.
p51
aVWhile such concerns must be taken very seriously,
p52
aVthey are not invincible.
p53
aVThey can be overcome when we don't lock our door to the outside world.
p54
aVHappiness can only be discovered
p55
aVas a gift of harmony between the whole and each single component.
p56
aVEven science \u2013 and you know it better than I do \u2013
p57
aVpoints to an understanding of reality
p58
aVas a place where every element connects and interacts with everything else.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd this brings me to my second message.
p61
aVHow wonderful would it be
p62
aVif the growth of scientific and technological innovation
p63
aVwould come along with more equality and social inclusion.
p64
aVHow wonderful would it be, while we discover faraway planets,
p65
aVto rediscover the needs of the brothers and sisters orbiting around us.
p66
aVHow wonderful would it be if solidarity,
p67
aVthis beautiful and, at times, inconvenient word,
p68
aVwere not simply reduced to social work,
p69
aVand became, instead, the default attitude
p70
aVin political, economic and scientific choices,
p71
aVas well as in the relationships among individuals, peoples and countries.
p72
aVOnly by educating people to a true solidarity
p73
aVwill we be able to overcome
p74
aVthe "culture of waste,"
p75
aVwhich doesn't concern only food and goods
p76
aVbut, first and foremost, the people
p77
aVwho are cast aside by our techno-economic systems
p78
aVwhich, without even realizing it,
p79
aVare now putting products at their core, instead of people.
p80
aa(lp81
VSolidarity is a term that many wish to erase from the dictionary.
p82
aVSolidarity, however, is not an automatic mechanism.
p83
aVIt cannot be programmed or controlled.
p84
aVIt is a free response born from the heart of each and everyone.
p85
aVYes, a free response!
p86
aVWhen one realizes
p87
aVthat life, even in the middle of so many contradictions, is a gift,
p88
aVthat love is the source and the meaning of life,
p89
aVhow can they withhold their urge to do good to another fellow being?
p90
aa(lp91
VIn order to do good,
p92
aVwe need memory, we need courage and we need creativity.
p93
aVAnd I know that TED gathers many creative minds.
p94
aVYes, love does require a creative, concrete
p95
aVand ingenious attitude.
p96
aVGood intentions and conventional formulas,
p97
aVso often used to appease our conscience, are not enough.
p98
aVLet us help each other, all together, to remember
p99
aVthat the other is not a statistic or a number.
p100
aVThe other has a face.
p101
aVThe "you" is always a real presence,
p102
aVa person to take care of.
p103
aa(lp104
VThere is a parable Jesus told to help us understand the difference
p105
aVbetween those who'd rather not be bothered and those who take care of the other.
p106
aVI am sure you have heard it before. It is the Parable of the Good Samaritan.
p107
aVWhen Jesus was asked: "Who is my neighbor?" -
p108
aVnamely, "Who should I take care of?" -
p109
aVhe told this story, the story of a man
p110
aVwho had been assaulted, robbed, beaten and abandoned along a dirt road.
p111
aVUpon seeing him, a priest and a Levite, two very influential people of the time,
p112
aVwalked past him without stopping to help.
p113
aVAfter a while, a Samaritan, a very much despised ethnicity at the time, walked by.
p114
aVSeeing the injured man lying on the ground,
p115
aVhe did not ignore him as if he weren't even there.
p116
aVInstead, he felt compassion for this man,
p117
aVwhich compelled him to act in a very concrete manner.
p118
aVHe poured oil and wine on the wounds of the helpless man,
p119
aVbrought him to a hostel
p120
aVand paid out of his pocket for him to be assisted.
p121
aa(lp122
VThe story of the Good Samaritan is the story of today\u2019s humanity.
p123
aVPeople's paths are riddled with suffering,
p124
aVas everything is centered around money, and things, instead of people.
p125
aVAnd often there is this habit, by people who call themselves "respectable,"
p126
aVof not taking care of the others,
p127
aVthus leaving behind thousands of human beings, or entire populations,
p128
aVon the side of the road.
p129
aVFortunately, there are also those who are creating a new world
p130
aVby taking care of the other, even out of their own pockets.
p131
aVMother Teresa actually said:
p132
aV"One cannot love, unless it is at their own expense."
p133
aa(lp134
VWe have so much to do, and we must do it together.
p135
aVBut how can we do that with all the evil we breathe every day?
p136
aVThank God,
p137
aVno system can nullify our desire to open up to the good,
p138
aVto compassion and to our capacity to react against evil,
p139
aVall of which stem from deep within our hearts.
p140
aVNow you might tell me,
p141
aV"Sure, these are beautiful words,
p142
aVbut I am not the Good Samaritan, nor Mother Teresa of Calcutta."
p143
aVOn the contrary: we are precious, each and every one of us.
p144
aVEach and every one of us is irreplaceable in the eyes of God.
p145
aVThrough the darkness of today's conflicts,
p146
aVeach and every one of us can become a bright candle,
p147
aVa reminder that light will overcome darkness,
p148
aVand never the other way around.
p149
aa(lp150
VTo Christians, the future does have a name,
p151
aVand its name is Hope.
p152
aVFeeling hopeful does not mean to be optimistically naïve
p153
aVand ignore the tragedy humanity is facing.
p154
aVHope is the virtue of a heart
p155
aVthat doesn't lock itself into darkness, that doesn't dwell on the past,
p156
aVdoes not simply get by in the present, but is able to see a tomorrow.
p157
aVHope is the door that opens onto the future.
p158
aVHope is a humble, hidden seed of life
p159
aVthat, with time, will develop into a large tree.
p160
aVIt is like some invisible yeast that allows the whole dough to grow,
p161
aVthat brings flavor to all aspects of life.
p162
aVAnd it can do so much,
p163
aVbecause a tiny flicker of light that feeds on hope
p164
aVis enough to shatter the shield of darkness.
p165
aVA single individual is enough for hope to exist,
p166
aVand that individual can be you.
p167
aVAnd then there will be another "you," and another "you,"
p168
aVand it turns into an "us."
p169
aVAnd so, does hope begin when we have an "us?"
p170
aVNo.
p171
aVHope began with one "you."
p172
aVWhen there is an "us," there begins a revolution.
p173
aa(lp174
VThe third message I would like to share today
p175
aVis, indeed, about revolution: the revolution of tenderness.
p176
aVAnd what is tenderness?
p177
aVIt is the love that comes close and becomes real.
p178
aVIt is a movement that starts from our heart
p179
aVand reaches the eyes, the ears and the hands.
p180
aVTenderness means to use our eyes to see the other,
p181
aVour ears to hear the other,
p182
aVto listen to the children, the poor, those who are afraid of the future.
p183
aVTo listen also to the silent cry of our common home,
p184
aVof our sick and polluted earth.
p185
aVTenderness means to use our hands and our heart
p186
aVto comfort the other,
p187
aVto take care of those in need.
p188
aa(lp189
VTenderness is the language of the young children,
p190
aVof those who need the other.
p191
aVA child\u2019s love for mom and dad
p192
aVgrows through their touch, their gaze, their voice, their tenderness.
p193
aVI like when I hear parents
p194
aVtalk to their babies, adapting to the little child,
p195
aVsharing the same level of communication.
p196
aVThis is tenderness: being on the same level as the other.
p197
aVGod himself descended into Jesus to be on our level.
p198
aVThis is the same path the Good Samaritan took.
p199
aVThis is the path that Jesus himself took.
p200
aVHe lowered himself,
p201
aVhe lived his entire human existence
p202
aVpracticing the real, concrete language of love.
p203
aa(lp204
VYes, tenderness is the path of choice
p205
aVfor the strongest, most courageous men and women.
p206
aVTenderness is not weakness; it is fortitude.
p207
aVIt is the path of solidarity, the path of humility.
p208
aVPlease, allow me to say it loud and clear:
p209
aVthe more powerful you are,
p210
aVthe more your actions will have an impact on people,
p211
aVthe more responsible you are to act humbly.
p212
aVIf you don\u2019t, your power will ruin you, and you will ruin the other.
p213
aVThere is a saying in Argentina:
p214
aV"Power is like drinking gin on an empty stomach."
p215
aVYou feel dizzy, you get drunk, you lose your balance,
p216
aVand you will end up hurting yourself and those around you,
p217
aVif you don\u2019t connect your power with humility and tenderness.
p218
aVThrough humility and concrete love, on the other hand,
p219
aVpower \u2013 the highest, the strongest one \u2013 becomes a service, a force for good.
p220
aa(lp221
VThe future of humankind isn't exclusively in the hands of politicians,
p222
aVof great leaders, of big companies.
p223
aVYes, they do hold an enormous responsibility.
p224
aVBut the future is, most of all, in the hands of those people
p225
aVwho recognize the other as a "you"
p226
aVand themselves as part of an "us."
p227
aVWe all need each other.
p228
aVAnd so, please, think of me as well with tenderness,
p229
aVso that I can fulfill the task I have been given
p230
aVfor the good of the other,
p231
aVof each and every one, of all of you,
p232
aVof all of us.
p233
aVThank you.
