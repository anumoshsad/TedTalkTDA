VThere's a man out there, somewhere,
p4
aVwho looks a little bit like the actor Idris Elba,
p5
aVor at least he did 20 years ago.
p6
aVI don't know anything else about him,
p7
aVexcept that he once saved my life
p8
aVby putting his own life in danger.
p9
aVThis man ran across four lanes of freeway traffic in the middle of the night
p10
aVto bring me back to safety
p11
aVafter a car accident that could have killed me.
p12
aVAnd the whole thing left me really shaken up, obviously,
p13
aVbut it also left me with this kind of burning, gnawing need
p14
aVto understand why he did it,
p15
aVwhat forces within him caused him to make the choice
p16
aVthat I owe my life to,
p17
aVto risk his own life to save the life of a stranger?
p18
aVIn other words, what are the causes of his or anybody else's capacity for altruism?
p19
aa(lp20
VBut first let me tell you what happened.
p21
aVThat night, I was 19 years old
p22
aVand driving back to my home in Tacoma, Washington,
p23
aVdown the Interstate 5 freeway,
p24
aVwhen a little dog darted out in front of my car.
p25
aVAnd I did exactly what you're not supposed to do,
p26
aVwhich is swerve to avoid it.
p27
aVAnd I discovered why you're not supposed to do that.
p28
aVI hit the dog anyways,
p29
aVand that sent the car into a fishtail,
p30
aVand then a spin across the freeway,
p31
aVuntil finally it wound up in the fast lane of the freeway
p32
aVfaced backwards into oncoming traffic
p33
aVand then the engine died.
p34
aVAnd I was sure in that moment that I was about to die too,
p35
aVbut I didn't
p36
aVbecause of the actions of that one brave man
p37
aVwho must have made the decision
p38
aVwithin a fraction of a second of seeing my stranded car
p39
aVto pull over and run across four lanes of freeway traffic
p40
aVin the dark
p41
aVto save my life.
p42
aVAnd then after he got my car working again
p43
aVand got me back to safety and made sure I was going to be all right,
p44
aVhe drove off again.
p45
aVHe never even told me his name,
p46
aVand I'm pretty sure I forgot to say thank you.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo before I go any further,
p49
aVI really want to take a moment
p50
aVto stop and say thank you to that stranger.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Applause)
p53
aa(lp54
VI tell you all of this
p55
aVbecause the events of that night changed the course of my life to some degree.
p56
aVI became a psychology researcher,
p57
aVand I've devoted my work to understanding the human capacity to care for others.
p58
aVWhere does it come from, and how does it develop,
p59
aVand what are the extreme forms that it can take?
p60
aVThese questions are really important to understanding basic aspects
p61
aVof human social nature.
p62
aVA lot of people, and this includes everybody
p63
aVfrom philosophers and economists to ordinary people
p64
aVbelieve that human nature is fundamentally selfish,
p65
aVthat we're only ever really motivated by our own welfare.
p66
aVBut if that's true, why do some people, like the stranger who rescued me,
p67
aVdo selfless things, like helping other people
p68
aVat enormous risk and cost to themselves?
p69
aVAnswering this question
p70
aVrequires exploring the roots of extraordinary acts of altruism,
p71
aVand what might make people who engage in such acts
p72
aVdifferent than other people.
p73
aVBut until recently, very little work on this topic had been done.
p74
aa(lp75
VThe actions of the man who rescued me
p76
aVmeet the most stringent definition of altruism,
p77
aVwhich is a voluntary, costly behavior
p78
aVmotivated by the desire to help another individual.
p79
aVSo it's a selfless act intended to benefit only the other.
p80
aVWhat could possibly explain an action like that?
p81
aVOne answer is compassion, obviously,
p82
aVwhich is a key driver of altruism.
p83
aVBut then the question becomes,
p84
aVwhy do some people seem to have more of it than others?
p85
aVAnd the answer may be that the brains of highly altruistic people
p86
aVare different in fundamental ways.
p87
aa(lp88
VBut to figure out how,
p89
aVI actually started from the opposite end,
p90
aVwith psychopaths.
p91
aVA common approach to understanding basic aspects of human nature,
p92
aVlike the desire to help other people,
p93
aVis to study people in whom that desire is missing,
p94
aVand psychopaths are exactly such a group.
p95
aVPsychopathy is a developmental disorder
p96
aVwith strongly genetic origins,
p97
aVand it results in a personality that's cold and uncaring
p98
aVand a tendency to engage in antisocial and sometimes very violent behavior.
p99
aVOnce my colleagues and I at the National Institute of Mental Health
p100
aVconducted some of the first ever brain imaging research
p101
aVof psychopathic adolescents,
p102
aVand our findings, and the findings of other researchers now,
p103
aVhave shown that people who are psychopathic
p104
aVpretty reliably exhibit three characteristics.
p105
aVFirst, although they're not generally insensitive to other people's emotions,
p106
aVthey are insensitive to signs that other people are in distress.
p107
aVAnd in particular,
p108
aVthey have difficulty recognizing fearful facial expressions like this one.
p109
aVAnd fearful expressions convey urgent need and emotional distress,
p110
aVand they usually elicit compassion and a desire to help
p111
aVin people who see them,
p112
aVso it makes sense that people who tend to lack compassion
p113
aValso tend to be insensitive to these cues.
p114
aa(lp115
VThe part of the brain
p116
aVthat's the most important for recognizing fearful expressions
p117
aVis called the amygdala.
p118
aVThere are very rare cases of people who lack amygdalas completely,
p119
aVand they're profoundly impaired in recognizing fearful expressions.
p120
aVAnd whereas healthy adults and children
p121
aVusually show big spikes in amygdala activity
p122
aVwhen they look at fearful expressions,
p123
aVpsychopaths' amygdalas are underreactive to these expressions.
p124
aVSometimes they don't react at all,
p125
aVwhich may be why they have trouble detecting these cues.
p126
aVFinally, psychopaths' amygdalas are smaller than average
p127
aVby about 18 or 20 percent.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo all of these findings are reliable and robust,
p130
aVand they're very interesting.
p131
aVBut remember that my main interest
p132
aVis not understanding why people don't care about others.
p133
aVIt's understanding why they do.
p134
aVSo the real question is,
p135
aVcould extraordinary altruism,
p136
aVwhich is the opposite of psychopathy
p137
aVin terms of compassion and the desire to help other people,
p138
aVemerge from a brain that is also the opposite of psychopathy?
p139
aVA sort of antipsychopathic brain,
p140
aVbetter able to recognize other people's fear,
p141
aVan amygdala that's more reactive to this expression
p142
aVand maybe larger than average as well?
p143
aa(lp144
VAs my research has now shown,
p145
aVall three things are true.
p146
aVAnd we discovered this
p147
aVby testing a population of truly extraordinary altruists.
p148
aVThese are people who have given one of their own kidneys
p149
aVto a complete stranger.
p150
aVSo these are people who have volunteered to undergo major surgery
p151
aVso that one of their own healthy kidneys can be removed
p152
aVand transplanted into a very ill stranger
p153
aVthat they've never met and may never meet.
p154
aV"Why would anybody do this?" is a very common question.
p155
aVAnd the answer may be
p156
aVthat the brains of these extraordinary altruists
p157
aVhave certain special characteristics.
p158
aVThey are better at recognizing other people's fear.
p159
aVThey're literally better at detecting when somebody else is in distress.
p160
aVThis may be in part because their amygdala is more reactive to these expressions.
p161
aVAnd remember, this is the same part of the brain that we found
p162
aVwas underreactive in people who are psychopathic.
p163
aVAnd finally, their amygdalas are larger than average as well,
p164
aVby about eight percent.
p165
aVSo together, what these data suggest
p166
aVis the existence of something like a caring continuum in the world
p167
aVthat's anchored at the one end by people who are highly psychopathic,
p168
aVand at the other by people who are very compassionate
p169
aVand driven to acts of extreme altruism.
p170
aa(lp171
VBut I should add that what makes extraordinary altruists so different
p172
aVis not just that they're more compassionate than average.
p173
aVThey are,
p174
aVbut what's even more unusual about them
p175
aVis that they're compassionate and altruistic
p176
aVnot just towards people who are in their own innermost circle
p177
aVof friends and family. Right?
p178
aVBecause to have compassion for people that you love and identify with
p179
aVis not extraordinary.
p180
aVTruly extraordinary altruists' compassion extends way beyond that circle,
p181
aVeven beyond their wider circle of acquaintances
p182
aVto people who are outside their social circle altogether,
p183
aVtotal strangers,
p184
aVjust like the man who rescued me.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd I've had the opportunity now to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors
p187
aVhow it is that they manage to generate such a wide circle of compassion
p188
aVthat they were willing to give a complete stranger their kidney.
p189
aVAnd I found it's a really difficult question for them to answer.
p190
aa(lp191
VI say, "How is it that you're willing to do this thing
p192
aVwhen so many other people don't?
p193
aVYou're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans
p194
aVwho has ever given a kidney to a stranger.
p195
aVWhat is it that makes you so special?"
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd what do they say?
p198
aa(lp199
VThey say, "Nothing.
p200
aVThere's nothing special about me.
p201
aVI'm just the same as everybody else."
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd I think that's actually a really telling answer,
p204
aVbecause it suggests that the circles of these altruists don't look like this,
p205
aVthey look more like this.
p206
aVThey have no center.
p207
aVThese altruists literally don't think of themselves
p208
aVas being at the center of anything,
p209
aVas being better or more inherently important than anybody else.
p210
aVWhen I asked one altruist why donating her kidney made sense to her,
p211
aVshe said, "Because it's not about me."
p212
aVAnother said,
p213
aV"I'm not different. I'm not unique.
p214
aVYour study here is going to find out that I'm just the same as you."
p215
aa(lp216
VI think the best description for this amazing lack of self-centeredness
p217
aVis humility,
p218
aVwhich is that quality that in the words of St. Augustine
p219
aVmakes men as angels.
p220
aVAnd why is that?
p221
aVIt's because if there's no center of your circle,
p222
aVthere can be no inner rings or outer rings,
p223
aVnobody who is more or less worthy of your care and compassion
p224
aVthan anybody else.
p225
aVAnd I think that this is what really distinguishes extraordinary altruists
p226
aVfrom the average person.
p227
aa(lp228
VBut I also think that this is a view of the world that's attainable by many
p229
aVand maybe even most people.
p230
aVAnd I think this because at the societal level,
p231
aVexpansions of altruism and compassion are already happening everywhere.
p232
aVThe psychologist Steven Pinker and others have shown
p233
aVthat all around the world people are becoming less and less accepting
p234
aVof suffering in ever-widening circles of others,
p235
aVwhich has led to declines of all kinds of cruelty and violence,
p236
aVfrom animal abuse to domestic violence to capital punishment.
p237
aVAnd it's led to increases in all kinds of altruism.
p238
aVA hundred years ago, people would have thought it was ludicrous
p239
aVhow normal and ordinary it is
p240
aVfor people to donate their blood and bone marrow
p241
aVto complete strangers today.
p242
aVIs it possible that a hundred years from now
p243
aVpeople will think that donating a kidney to a stranger
p244
aVis just as normal and ordinary
p245
aVas we think donating blood and bone marrow is today?
p246
aVMaybe.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo what's at the root of all these amazing changes?
p249
aVIn part it seems to be
p250
aVincreases in wealth and standards of living.
p251
aVAs societies become wealthier and better off,
p252
aVpeople seem to turn their focus of attention outward,
p253
aVand as a result, all kinds of altruism towards strangers increases,
p254
aVfrom volunteering to charitable donations and even altruistic kidney donations.
p255
aVBut all of these changes also yield
p256
aVa strange and paradoxical result,
p257
aVwhich is that even as the world is becoming a better and more humane place,
p258
aVwhich it is,
p259
aVthere's a very common perception that it's becoming worse
p260
aVand more cruel, which it's not.
p261
aVAnd I don't know exactly why this is,
p262
aVbut I think it may be that we now just know so much more
p263
aVabout the suffering of strangers in distant places,
p264
aVand so we now care a lot more
p265
aVabout the suffering of those distant strangers.
p266
aVBut what's clear is the kinds of changes we're seeing show
p267
aVthat the roots of altruism and compassion
p268
aVare just as much a part of human nature as cruelty and violence,
p269
aVmaybe even more so,
p270
aVand while some people do seem to be inherently more sensitive
p271
aVto the suffering of distant others,
p272
aVI really believe that the ability to remove oneself
p273
aVfrom the center of the circle
p274
aVand expand the circle of compassion outward to include even strangers
p275
aVis within reach for almost everyone.
