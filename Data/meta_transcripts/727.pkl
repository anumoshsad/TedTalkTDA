VSomething called the Danish Twin Study
p4
aVestablished that only about 10 percent
p5
aVof how long the average person lives,
p6
aVwithin certain biological limits, is dictated by our genes.
p7
aVThe other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle.
p8
aVSo the premise of Blue Zones: if we can find the
p9
aVoptimal lifestyle of longevity
p10
aVwe can come up with a de facto formula
p11
aVfor longevity.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut if you ask the average American what the optimal formula
p14
aVof longevity is, they probably couldn't tell you.
p15
aVThey've probably heard of the South Beach Diet, or the Atkins Diet.
p16
aVYou have the USDA food pyramid.
p17
aVThere is what Oprah tells us.
p18
aVThere is what Doctor Oz tells us.
p19
aa(lp20
VThe fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion
p21
aVaround what really helps us live longer better.
p22
aVShould you be running marathons or doing yoga?
p23
aVShould you eat organic meats
p24
aVor should you be eating tofu?
p25
aVWhen it comes to supplements, should you be taking them?
p26
aVHow about these hormones or resveratrol?
p27
aVAnd does purpose play into it?
p28
aVSpirituality? And how about how we socialize?
p29
aa(lp30
VWell, our approach to finding longevity
p31
aVwas to team up with National Geographic,
p32
aVand the National Institute on Aging,
p33
aVto find the four demographically confirmed areas
p34
aVthat are geographically defined.
p35
aVAnd then bring a team of experts in there
p36
aVto methodically go through exactly what these people do,
p37
aVto distill down the cross-cultural distillation.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd at the end of this I'm going to tell you what that distillation is.
p40
aVBut first I'd like to debunk some common myths
p41
aVwhen it comes to longevity.
p42
aVAnd the first myth is if you try really hard
p43
aVyou can live to be 100.
p44
aVFalse.
p45
aVThe problem is, only about one out of 5,000 people
p46
aVin America live to be 100.
p47
aVYour chances are very low.
p48
aVEven though it's the fastest growing demographic in America,
p49
aVit's hard to reach 100.
p50
aVThe problem is
p51
aVthat we're not programmed for longevity.
p52
aVWe are programmed for something called
p53
aVprocreative success.
p54
aVI love that word.
p55
aVIt reminds me of my college days.
p56
aa(lp57
VBiologists term procreative success to mean
p58
aVthe age where you have children
p59
aVand then another generation, the age when your children have children.
p60
aVAfter that the effect of evolution
p61
aVcompletely dissipates.
p62
aVIf you're a mammal, if you're a rat
p63
aVor an elephant, or a human, in between, it's the same story.
p64
aVSo to make it to age 100, you not only have to have
p65
aVhad a very good lifestyle, you also have to have won
p66
aVthe genetic lottery.
p67
aa(lp68
VThe second myth is,
p69
aVthere are treatments that can help slow,
p70
aVreverse, or even stop aging.
p71
aVFalse.
p72
aVWhen you think of it, there is 99 things that can age us.
p73
aVDeprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes,
p74
aVthose brain cells die, they never come back.
p75
aVPlay tennis too hard, on your knees, ruin your cartilage,
p76
aVthe cartilage never comes back.
p77
aVOur arteries can clog. Our brains can gunk up with plaque,
p78
aVand we can get Alzheimer's.
p79
aVThere is just too many things to go wrong.
p80
aa(lp81
VOur bodies have 35 trillion cells,
p82
aVtrillion with a "T." We're talking national debt numbers here.
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVThose cells turn themselves over once every eight years.
p85
aVAnd every time they turn themselves over
p86
aVthere is some damage. And that damage builds up.
p87
aVAnd it builds up exponentially.
p88
aVIt's a little bit like the days when we all had
p89
aVBeatles albums or Eagles albums
p90
aVand we'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape,
p91
aVand let our friends copy that cassette tape,
p92
aVand pretty soon, with successive generations
p93
aVthat tape sounds like garbage.
p94
aVWell, the same things happen to our cells.
p95
aVThat's why a 65-year-old person
p96
aVis aging at a rate of about
p97
aV125 times faster
p98
aVthan a 12-year-old person.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo, if there is nothing you can do
p101
aVto slow your aging or stop your aging,
p102
aVwhat am I doing here?
p103
aVWell, the fact of the matter is
p104
aVthe best science tells us that the capacity of the human body,
p105
aVmy body, your body,
p106
aVis about 90 years,
p107
aVa little bit more for women.
p108
aVBut life expectancy in this country
p109
aVis only 78.
p110
aVSo somewhere along the line,
p111
aVwe're leaving about 12 good years on the table.
p112
aVThese are years that we could get.
p113
aVAnd research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease,
p114
aVheart disease, cancer and diabetes.
p115
aa(lp116
VWe think the best way to get these missing years
p117
aVis to look at the cultures around the world
p118
aVthat are actually experiencing them,
p119
aVareas where people are living to age 100
p120
aVat rates up to 10 times greater than we are,
p121
aVareas where the life expectancy
p122
aVis an extra dozen years,
p123
aVthe rate of middle age mortality is a fraction
p124
aVof what it is in this country.
p125
aa(lp126
VWe found our first Blue Zone about 125 miles
p127
aVoff the coast of Italy, on the island of Sardinia.
p128
aVAnd not the entire island, the island is about 1.4 million people,
p129
aVbut only up in the highlands, an area called the Nuoro province.
p130
aVAnd here we have this area where men live the longest,
p131
aVabout 10 times more centenarians than we have here in America.
p132
aVAnd this is a place where people not only reach age 100,
p133
aVthey do so with extraordinary vigor.
p134
aVPlaces where 102 year olds still ride their bike to work,
p135
aVchop wood, and can beat a guy 60 years younger than them.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VTheir history actually goes back to about the time of Christ.
p139
aVIt's actually a Bronze Age culture that's been isolated.
p140
aVBecause the land is so infertile,
p141
aVthey largely are shepherds,
p142
aVwhich occasions regular, low-intensity physical activity.
p143
aVTheir diet is mostly plant-based,
p144
aVaccentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields.
p145
aVThey came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread
p146
aVcalled carta musica made out of durum wheat,
p147
aVa type of cheese made from grass-fed animals
p148
aVso the cheese is high in Omega-3 fatty acids
p149
aVinstead of Omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals,
p150
aVand a type of wine that has three times the level
p151
aVof polyphenols than any known wine in the world.
p152
aVIt's called Cannonau.
p153
aa(lp154
VBut the real secret I think lies more
p155
aVin the way that they organize their society.
p156
aVAnd one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society
p157
aVis how they treat older people.
p158
aVYou ever notice here in America, social equity
p159
aVseems to peak at about age 24?
p160
aVJust look at the advertisements.
p161
aVHere in Sardinia, the older you get
p162
aVthe more equity you have,
p163
aVthe more wisdom you're celebrated for.
p164
aVYou go into the bars in Sardinia,
p165
aVinstead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar,
p166
aVyou see the centenarian of the month calendar.
p167
aa(lp168
VThis, as it turns out, is not only good for your aging parents
p169
aVto keep them close to the family \u2014
p170
aVit imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy \u2014
p171
aVresearch shows it's also good for the children of those families,
p172
aVwho have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease.
p173
aVThat's called the grandmother effect.
p174
aa(lp175
VWe found our second Blue Zone
p176
aVon the other side of the planet,
p177
aVabout 800 miles south of Tokyo,
p178
aVon the archipelago of Okinawa.
p179
aVOkinawa is actually 161 small islands.
p180
aVAnd in the northern part of the main island,
p181
aVthis is ground zero for world longevity.
p182
aVThis is a place where the oldest living female population is found.
p183
aVIt's a place where people have the longest disability-free
p184
aVlife expectancy in the world.
p185
aVThey have what we want.
p186
aVThey live a long time, and tend to die in their sleep,
p187
aVvery quickly,
p188
aVand often, I can tell you, after sex.
p189
aa(lp190
VThey live about seven good years longer than the average American.
p191
aVFive times as many centenarians as we have in America.
p192
aVOne fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer,
p193
aVbig killers here in America.
p194
aVAnd one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease.
p195
aVAnd the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers
p196
aVsuggests strongly they have something to teach us.
p197
aVWhat do they do?
p198
aVOnce again, a plant-based diet,
p199
aVfull of vegetables with lots of color in them.
p200
aVAnd they eat about eight times as much tofu
p201
aVas Americans do.
p202
aa(lp203
VMore significant than what they eat is how they eat it.
p204
aVThey have all kinds of little strategies
p205
aVto keep from overeating,
p206
aVwhich, as you know, is a big problem here in America.
p207
aVA few of the strategies we observed:
p208
aVthey eat off of smaller plates, so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting.
p209
aVInstead of serving family style,
p210
aVwhere you can sort of mindlessly eat as you're talking,
p211
aVthey serve at the counter, put the food away,
p212
aVand then bring it to the table.
p213
aa(lp214
VThey also have a 3,000-year-old adage,
p215
aVwhich I think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented.
p216
aVIt was invented by Confucius.
p217
aVAnd that diet is known as the Hara, Hatchi, Bu diet.
p218
aVIt's simply a little saying these people say before their meal
p219
aVto remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [80] percent full.
p220
aVIt takes about a half hour for that full feeling
p221
aVto travel from your belly to your brain.
p222
aVAnd by remembering to stop at 80 percent
p223
aVit helps keep you from doing that very thing.
p224
aa(lp225
VBut, like Sardinia, Okinawa has a few social constructs
p226
aVthat we can associate with longevity.
p227
aVWe know that isolation kills.
p228
aVFifteen years ago, the average American had three good friends.
p229
aVWe're down to one and half right now.
p230
aVIf you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa,
p231
aVyou were born into a system where you
p232
aVautomatically have a half a dozen friends
p233
aVwith whom you travel through life.
p234
aVThey call it a Moai. And if you're in a Moai
p235
aVyou're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck,
p236
aVand if things go bad,
p237
aVchild gets sick, parent dies,
p238
aVyou always have somebody who has your back.
p239
aVThis particular Moai, these five ladies
p240
aVhave been together for 97 years.
p241
aVTheir average age is 102.
p242
aa(lp243
VTypically in America
p244
aVwe've divided our adult life up into two sections.
p245
aVThere is our work life,
p246
aVwhere we're productive.
p247
aVAnd then one day, boom, we retire.
p248
aVAnd typically that has meant
p249
aVretiring to the easy chair,
p250
aVor going down to Arizona to play golf.
p251
aVIn the Okinawan language there is not even
p252
aVa word for retirement.
p253
aVInstead there is one word
p254
aVthat imbues your entire life,
p255
aVand that word is "ikigai."
p256
aVAnd, roughly translated, it means
p257
aV"the reason for which you wake up in the morning."
p258
aa(lp259
VFor this 102-year-old karate master,
p260
aVhis ikigai was carrying forth this martial art.
p261
aVFor this hundred-year-old fisherman
p262
aVit was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week.
p263
aVAnd this is a question. The National Institute on Aging
p264
aVactually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians.
p265
aVAnd one of the questions, they were very culturally astute,
p266
aVthe people who put the questionnaire.
p267
aVOne of the questions was, "What is your ikigai?"
p268
aVThey instantly knew why they woke up in the morning.
p269
aVFor this 102 year old woman, her ikigai
p270
aVwas simply her great-great-great-granddaughter.
p271
aVTwo girls separated in age by 101 and a half years.
p272
aVAnd I asked her what it felt like
p273
aVto hold a great-great-great-granddaughter.
p274
aVAnd she put her head back and she said,
p275
aV"It feels like leaping into heaven."
p276
aVI thought that was a wonderful thought.
p277
aa(lp278
VMy editor at Geographic
p279
aVwanted me to find America's Blue Zone.
p280
aVAnd for a while we looked on the prairies of Minnesota,
p281
aVwhere actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians.
p282
aVBut that's because all the young people left.
p283
aV(Laughter)
p284
aVSo, we turned to the data again.
p285
aVAnd we found America's longest-lived population
p286
aVamong the Seventh-Day Adventists
p287
aVconcentrated in and around Loma Linda, California.
p288
aVAdventists are conservative Methodists.
p289
aVThey celebrate their Sabbath
p290
aVfrom sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday.
p291
aVA "24-hour sanctuary in time," they call it.
p292
aVAnd they follow five little habits
p293
aVthat conveys to them extraordinary longevity,
p294
aVcomparatively speaking.
p295
aa(lp296
VIn America here, life expectancy
p297
aVfor the average woman is 80.
p298
aVBut for an Adventist woman,
p299
aVtheir life expectancy is 89.
p300
aVAnd the difference is even more pronounced among men,
p301
aVwho are expected to live about 11 years
p302
aVlonger than their American counterparts.
p303
aVNow, this is a study that followed
p304
aVabout 70,000 people for 30 years.
p305
aVSterling study. And I think it supremely illustrates
p306
aVthe premise of this Blue Zone project.
p307
aa(lp308
VThis is a heterogeneous community.
p309
aVIt's white, black, Hispanic, Asian.
p310
aVThe only thing that they have in common are a set of
p311
aVvery small lifestyle habits
p312
aVthat they follow ritualistically
p313
aVfor most of their lives.
p314
aVThey take their diet directly from the Bible.
p315
aVGenesis: Chapter one, Verse [29],
p316
aVwhere God talks about legumes and seeds,
p317
aVand on one more stanza about green plants,
p318
aVostensibly missing is meat.
p319
aVThey take this sanctuary in time very serious.
p320
aa(lp321
VFor 24 hours every week,
p322
aVno matter how busy they are, how stressed out they are at work,
p323
aVwhere the kids need to be driven,
p324
aVthey stop everything and they focus on their God,
p325
aVtheir social network, and then, hardwired right in the religion,
p326
aVare nature walks.
p327
aVAnd the power of this is not that it's done occasionally,
p328
aVthe power is it's done every week for a lifetime.
p329
aVNone of it's hard. None of it costs money.
p330
aVAdventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists.
p331
aVSo, if you go to an Adventist's party
p332
aVyou don't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint.
p333
aVInstead they're talking about their next nature walk,
p334
aVexchanging recipes, and yes, they pray.
p335
aVBut they influence each other in profound and measurable ways.
p336
aa(lp337
VThis is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham.
p338
aVEllsworth Whareham is 97 years old.
p339
aVHe's a multimillionaire,
p340
aVyet when a contractor wanted 6,000 dollars
p341
aVto build a privacy fence,
p342
aVhe said, "For that kind of money I'll do it myself."
p343
aVSo for the next three days he was out shoveling cement,
p344
aVand hauling poles around.
p345
aVAnd predictably, perhaps, on the fourth day
p346
aVhe ended up in the operating room.
p347
aVBut not as the guy on the table;
p348
aVthe guy doing open-heart surgery.
p349
aVAt 97 he still does 20 open-heart surgeries every month.
p350
aa(lp351
VEd Rawlings, 103 years old now,
p352
aVan active cowboy, starts his morning with a swim.
p353
aVAnd on weekends he likes to put on the boards,
p354
aVthrow up rooster tails.
p355
aa(lp356
VAnd then Marge Deton.
p357
aVMarge is 104.
p358
aVHer grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here.
p359
aVShe starts her day with lifting weights.
p360
aVShe rides her bicycle.
p361
aVAnd then she gets in her root-beer colored
p362
aV1994 Cadillac Seville,
p363
aVand tears down the San Bernardino freeway,
p364
aVwhere she still volunteers for seven different organizations.
p365
aVI've been on 19 hardcore expeditions.
p366
aVI'm probably the only person you'll ever meet
p367
aVwho rode his bicycle across
p368
aVthe Sahara desert without sunscreen.
p369
aVBut I'll tell you, there is no adventure more harrowing
p370
aVthan riding shotgun with Marge Deton.
p371
aV"A stranger is a friend I haven't met yet!" she'd say to me.
p372
aa(lp373
VSo, what are the common denominators
p374
aVin these three cultures?
p375
aVWhat are the things that they all do?
p376
aVAnd we managed to boil it down to nine.
p377
aVIn fact we've done two more Blue Zone expeditions since this
p378
aVand these common denominators hold true.
p379
aVAnd the first one,
p380
aVand I'm about to utter a heresy here,
p381
aVnone of them exercise,
p382
aVat least the way we think of exercise.
p383
aVInstead, they set up their lives
p384
aVso that they are constantly nudged into physical activity.
p385
aVThese 100-year-old Okinawan women
p386
aVare getting up and down off the ground, they sit on the floor,
p387
aV30 or 40 times a day.
p388
aa(lp389
VSardinians live in vertical houses, up and down the stairs.
p390
aVEvery trip to the store, or to church
p391
aVor to a friend's house occasions a walk.
p392
aVThey don't have any conveniences.
p393
aVThere is not a button to push to do yard work or house work.
p394
aVIf they want to mix up a cake, they're doing it by hand.
p395
aVThat's physical activity.
p396
aVThat burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does.
p397
aVWhen they do do intentional physical activity,
p398
aVit's the things they enjoy. They tend to walk,
p399
aVthe only proven way to stave off cognitive decline,
p400
aVand they all tend to have a garden.
p401
aVThey know how to set up their life in the right way
p402
aVso they have the right outlook.
p403
aa(lp404
VEach of these cultures take time to downshift.
p405
aVThe Sardinians pray. The Seventh-Day Adventists pray.
p406
aVThe Okinawans have this ancestor veneration.
p407
aVBut when you're in a hurry or stressed out,
p408
aVthat triggers something called the inflammatory response,
p409
aVwhich is associated with everything from Alzheimer's
p410
aVdisease to cardiovascular disease.
p411
aVWhen you slow down for 15 minutes a day
p412
aVyou turn that inflammatory state
p413
aVinto a more anti-inflammatory state.
p414
aa(lp415
VThey have vocabulary for sense of purpose,
p416
aVikigai, like the Okinawans.
p417
aVYou know the two most dangerous years in your life
p418
aVare the year you're born, because of infant mortality,
p419
aVand the year you retire.
p420
aVThese people know their sense of purpose,
p421
aVand they activate in their life, that's worth about seven years
p422
aVof extra life expectancy.
p423
aa(lp424
VThere's no longevity diet.
p425
aVInstead, these people drink a little bit every day,
p426
aVnot a hard sell to the American population.
p427
aV(Laughter)
p428
aVThey tend to eat a plant-based diet.
p429
aVDoesn't mean they don't eat meat, but lots of beans and nuts.
p430
aVAnd they have strategies to keep from overeating,
p431
aVlittle things that nudge them away from the table at the right time.
p432
aa(lp433
VAnd then the foundation of all this is how they connect.
p434
aVThey put their families first,
p435
aVtake care of their children and their aging parents.
p436
aVThey all tend to belong to a faith-based community,
p437
aVwhich is worth between four and 14
p438
aVextra years of life expectancy
p439
aVif you do it four times a month.
p440
aVAnd the biggest thing here
p441
aVis they also belong to the right tribe.
p442
aVThey were either born into
p443
aVor they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people.
p444
aa(lp445
VWe know from the Framingham studies,
p446
aVthat if your three best friends are obese
p447
aVthere is a 50 percent better chance that you'll be overweight.
p448
aVSo, if you hang out with unhealthy people,
p449
aVthat's going to have a measurable impact over time.
p450
aVInstead, if your friend's idea of recreation
p451
