aa(lp7
VI am a papercutter.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVI cut stories.
p10
aVSo my process is very straightforward.
p11
aVI take a piece of paper,
p12
aVI visualize my story,
p13
aVsometimes I sketch, sometimes I don't.
p14
aVAnd as my image
p15
aVis already inside the paper,
p16
aVI just have to remove
p17
aVwhat's not from that story.
p18
aVSo I didn't come to papercutting
p19
aVin a straight line.
p20
aVIn fact,
p21
aVI see it more as a spiral.
p22
aa(lp23
VI was not born
p24
aVwith a blade in my hand.
p25
aVAnd I don't remember papercutting as a child.
p26
aVAs a teenager,
p27
aVI was sketching, drawing,
p28
aVand I wanted to be an artist.
p29
aVBut I was also a rebel.
p30
aVAnd I left everything
p31
aVand went for a long series of odd jobs.
p32
aVSo among them,
p33
aVI have been a shepherdess,
p34
aVa truck driver,
p35
aVa factory worker,
p36
aVa cleaning lady.
p37
aVI worked in tourism for one year
p38
aVin Mexico,
p39
aVone year in Egypt.
p40
aVI moved for two years
p41
aVin Taiwan.
p42
aVAnd then I settled in New York
p43
aVwhere I became a tour guide.
p44
aVAnd I still worked as a tour leader,
p45
aVtraveled back and forth
p46
aVin China, Tibet and Central Asia.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo of course, it took time, and I was nearly 40,
p49
aVand I decided it's time
p50
aVto start as an artist.
p51
aV(Applause)
p52
aVI chose papercutting
p53
aVbecause paper is cheap,
p54
aVit's light,
p55
aVand you can use it
p56
aVin a lot of different ways.
p57
aVAnd I chose the language of silhouette
p58
aVbecause graphically it's very efficient.
p59
aVAnd it's also just getting to the essential of things.
p60
aVSo the word "silhouette"
p61
aVcomes from a minister of finance,
p62
aVEtienne de Silhouette.
p63
aVAnd he slashed so many budgets
p64
aVthat people said they couldn't afford
p65
aVpaintings anymore,
p66
aVand they needed to have their portrait
p67
aV"a la silhouette."
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aVSo I made series of images, cuttings,
p70
aVand I assembled them in portfolios.
p71
aVAnd people told me \u2014
p72
aVlike these 36 views of the Empire State building \u2014
p73
aVthey told me, "You're making artist books."
p74
aa(lp75
VSo artist books have a lot of definitions.
p76
aVThey come in a lot of different shapes.
p77
aVBut to me,
p78
aVthey are fascinating objects
p79
aVto visually narrate a story.
p80
aVThey can be with words
p81
aVor without words.
p82
aVAnd I have a passion
p83
aVfor images and for words.
p84
aVI love pun
p85
aVand the relation to the unconscious.
p86
aVI love oddities of languages.
p87
aVAnd everywhere I lived, I learned the languages,
p88
aVbut never mastered them.
p89
aVSo I'm always looking
p90
aVfor the false cognates
p91
aVor identical words in different languages.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo as you can guess, my mother tongue is French.
p94
aVAnd my daily language is English.
p95
aVSo I did a series of work
p96
aVwhere it was identical words
p97
aVin French and in English.
p98
aVSo one of these works
p99
aVis the "Spelling Spider."
p100
aVSo the Spelling Spider
p101
aVis a cousin of the spelling bee.
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aVBut it's much more connected to the Web.
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aVAnd this spider
p106
aVspins a bilingual alphabet.
p107
aVSo you can read "architecture active"
p108
aVor "active architecture."
p109
aVSo this spider goes through the whole alphabet
p110
aVwith identical adjectives and substantives.
p111
aVSo if you don't know one of these languages,
p112
aVit's instant learning.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd one ancient form of the book
p115
aVis scrolls.
p116
aVSo scrolls are very convenient,
p117
aVbecause you can create a large image
p118
aVon a very small table.
p119
aVSo the unexpected consequences of that
p120
aVis that you only see one part of your image,
p121
aVso it makes a very freestyle architecture.
p122
aVAnd I'm making all those kinds of windows.
p123
aVSo it's to look beyond the surface.
p124
aVIt's to have a look
p125
aVat different worlds.
p126
aVAnd very often I've been an outsider.
p127
aVSo I want to see how things work
p128
aVand what's happening.
p129
aVSo each window
p130
aVis an image
p131
aVand is a world
p132
aVthat I often revisit.
p133
aVAnd I revisit this world
p134
aVthinking about the image
p135
aVor cliché about what we want to do,
p136
aVand what are the words, colloquialisms,
p137
aVthat we have with the expressions.
p138
aa(lp139
VIt's all if.
p140
aVSo what if we were living in balloon houses?
p141
aVIt would make a very uplifting world.
p142
aVAnd we would leave a very low footprint on the planet.
p143
aVIt would be so light.
p144
aVSo sometimes I view from the inside,
p145
aVlike EgoCentriCity
p146
aVand the inner circles.
p147
aVSometimes it's a global view,
p148
aVto see our common roots
p149
aVand how we can use them to catch dreams.
p150
aVAnd we can use them also
p151
aVas a safety net.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd my inspirations
p154
aVare very eclectic.
p155
aVI'm influenced by everything I read,
p156
aVeverything I see.
p157
aVI have some stories that are humorous,
p158
aVlike "Dead Beats."
p159
aV(Laughter)
p160
aVOther ones are historical.
p161
aVHere it's "CandyCity."
p162
aVIt's a non-sugar-coated
p163
aVhistory of sugar.
p164
aVIt goes from slave trade
p165
aVto over-consumption of sugar
p166
aVwith some sweet moments in between.
p167
aVAnd sometimes I have an emotional response to news,
p168
aVsuch as the 2010 Haitian earthquake.
p169
aVOther times, it's not even my stories.
p170
aVPeople tell me their lives,
p171
aVtheir memories, their aspirations,
p172
aVand I create a mindscape.
p173
aVI channel their history
p174
aV[so that] they have a place to go back
p175
aVto look at their life and its possibilities.
p176
aVI call them Freudian cities.
p177
aa(lp178
VI cannot speak for all my images,
p179
aVso I'll just go through a few of my worlds
p180
aVjust with the title.
p181
aV"ModiCity."
p182
aV"ElectriCity."
p183
aV"MAD Growth on Columbus Circle."
p184
aV"ReefCity."
p185
aV"A Web of Time."
p186
aV"Chaos City."
p187
aV"Daily Battles."
p188
aV"FeliCity."
p189
aV"Floating Islands."
p190
aVAnd at one point,
p191
aVI had to do "The Whole Nine Yards."
p192
aVSo it's actually a papercut that's nine yards long.
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aVSo in life and in papercutting,
p195
aVeverything is connected.
p196
aVOne story leads to another.
p197
aVI was also interested
p198
aVin the physicality of this format,
p199
aVbecause you have to walk to see it.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd parallel to my cutting
p202
aVis my running.
p203
aVI started with small images,
p204
aVI started with a few miles.
p205
aVLarger images, I started to run marathons.
p206
aVThen I went to run 50K, then 60K.
p207
aVThen I ran 50 miles \u2014 ultramarathons.
p208
aVAnd I still feel I'm running,
p209
aVit's just the training
p210
aVto become a long-distance papercutter.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd running gives me a lot of energy.
p215
aVHere is a three-week papercutting marathon
p216
aVat the Museum of Arts and Design
p217
aVin New York City.
p218
aVThe result is "Hells and Heavens."
p219
aVIt's two panels 13 ft. high.
p220
aVThey were installed in the museum on two floors,
p221
aVbut in fact, it's a continuous image.
p222
aVAnd I call it "Hells and Heavens"
p223
aVbecause it's daily hells and daily heavens.
p224
aVThere is no border in between.
p225
aVSome people are born in hells,
p226
aVand against all odds, they make it to heavens.
p227
aVOther people make the opposite trip.
p228
aVThat's the border.
p229
aVYou have sweatshops in hells.
p230
aVYou have people renting their wings in the heavens.
p231
aVAnd then you have all those individual stories
p232
aVwhere sometimes we even have the same action,
p233
aVand the result puts you in hells or in heavens.
p234
aVSo the whole "Hells and Heavens"
p235
aVis about free will
p236
aVand determinism.
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd in papercutting,
p239
aVyou have the drawing as the structure itself.
p240
aVSo you can take it off the wall.
p241
aVHere it's an artist book installation
p242
aVcalled "Identity Project."
p243
aVIt's not autobiographical identities.
p244
aVThey are more our social identities.
p245
aVAnd then you can just walk behind them
p246
aVand try them on.
p247
aVSo it's like the different layers
p248
aVof what we are made of
p249
aVand what we present to the world
p250
aVas an identity.
p251
aa(lp252
VThat's another artist book project.
p253
aVIn fact, in the picture, you have two of them.
p254
aVIt's one I'm wearing
p255
aVand one that's on exhibition
p256
aVat the Center for Books Arts in New York City.
p257
aVWhy do I call it a book?
p258
aVIt's called "Fashion Statement,"
p259
aVand there are quotes about fashion,
p260
aVso you can read it,
p261
aVand also,
p262
aVbecause the definition of artist book
p263
aVis very generous.
p264
aVSo artist books, you take them off the wall.
p265
aVYou take them for a walk.
p266
aVYou can also install them as public art.
p267
aVHere it's in Scottsdale, Arizona,
p268
aVand it's called "Floating Memories."
p269
aVSo it's regional memories,
p270
aVand they are just randomly moved by the wind.
p271
aa(lp272
VI love public art.
p273
aVAnd I entered competitions
p274
aVfor a long time.
p275
aVAfter eight years of rejection,
p276
aVI was thrilled to get my first commission
p277
aVwith the Percent for Art in New York City.
p278
aVIt was for a merger station
p279
aVfor emergency workers and firemen.
p280
aVI made an artist book
p281
aVthat's in stainless steel
p282
aVinstead of paper.
p283
aVI called it "Working in the Same Direction."
p284
aVBut I added weathervanes on both sides
p285
aVto show that they cover all directions.
p286
aVWith public art,
p287
aVI could also make cut glass.
p288
aVHere it's faceted glass in the Bronx.
p289
aVAnd each time I make public art,
p290
aVI want something that's really relevant
p291
aVto the place it's installed.
p292
aVSo for the subway in New York,
p293
aVI saw a correspondence
p294
aVbetween riding the subway
p295
aVand reading.
p296
aVIt is travel in time, travel on time.
p297
aVAnd Bronx literature,
p298
aVit's all about Bronx writers
p299
aVand their stories.
p300
aa(lp301
VAnother glass project
p302
aVis in a public library
p303
aVin San Jose, California.
p304
aVSo I made a vegetable point of view
p305
aVof the growth of San Jose.
p306
aVSo I started in the center
p307
aVwith the acorn
p308
aVfor the Ohlone Indian civilization.
p309
aVThen I have the fruit from Europe
p310
aVfor the ranchers.
p311
aVAnd then the fruit of the world for Silicon Valley today.
p312
aVAnd it's still growing.
p313
aVSo the technique, it's cut,
p314
aVsandblasted, etched
p315
aVand printed glass into architectural glass.
p316
aVAnd outside the library,
p317
aVI wanted to make a place to cultivate your mind.
p318
aVI took library material
p319
aVthat had fruit in their title
p320
aVand I used them to make an orchard walk
p321
aVwith these fruits of knowledge.
p322
aVI also planted the bibliotree.
p323
aVSo it's a tree,
p324
aVand in its trunk you have the roots of languages.
p325
aVAnd it's all about international writing systems.
p326
aVAnd on the branches
p327
aVyou have library material growing.
p328
aVYou can also have function and form
p329
aVwith public art.
p330
aVSo in Aurora, Colorado it's a bench.
p331
aVBut you have a bonus with this bench.
p332
aVBecause if you sit a long time in summer in shorts,
p333
aVyou will walk away
p334
aVwith temporary branding of
p335
aVthe story element on your thighs.
p336
aa(lp337
V(Laughter)
p338
aa(lp339
VAnother functional work,
p340
aVit's in the south side of Chicago
p341
aVfor a subway station.
p342
aVAnd it's called "Seeds of the Future are Planted Today."
p343
aVIt's a story about transformation
p344
aVand connections.
p345
aVSo it acts as a screen
p346
aVto protect the rail and the commuter,
p347
aVand not to have objects falling on the rails.
p348
aVTo be able to change fences
p349
aVand window guards into flowers,
p350
aVit's fantastic.
p351
aVAnd here I've been working for the last three years
p352
aVwith a South Bronx developer
p353
aVto bring art to life
p354
aVto low-income buildings
p355
aVand affordable housing.
p356
aVSo each building has its own personality.
p357
aVAnd sometimes it's about a legacy of the neighborhood,
p358
aVlike in Morrisania, about the jazz history.
p359
aVAnd for other projects, like in Paris,
p360
aVit's about the name of the street.
p361
aVIt's called Rue des Prairies \u2014 Prairie Street.
p362
aVSo I brought back the rabbit,
p363
aVthe dragonfly,
p364
aVto stay in that street.
p365
aa(lp366
VAnd in 2009,
p367
aVI was asked to make a poster
p368
aVto be placed in the subway cars in New York City
p369
aVfor a year.
p370
aVSo that was a very captive audience.
p371
aVAnd I wanted to give them an escape.
p372
aVI created "All Around Town."
p373
aVIt is a papercutting,
p374
aVand then after, I added color on the computer.
p375
aVSo I can call it techno-crafted.
p376
aa(lp377
VAnd along the way,
p378
aVI'm kind of making papercuttings
p379
aVand adding other techniques.
p380
aVBut the result is always to have stories.
p381
aVSo the stories, they have a lot of possibilities.
p382
aVThey have a lot of scenarios.
p383
aVI don't know the stories.
p384
aVI take images from our global imagination,
p385
aVfrom cliché, from things we are thinking about,
p386
aVfrom history.
p387
aVAnd everybody's a narrator,
p388
aVbecause everybody has a story to tell.
p389
aVBut more important
p390
aVis everybody has to make a story
p391
aVto make sense of the world.
p392
aVAnd in all these universes,
p393
aVit's like imagination is the vehicle
p394
aVto be transported with,
p395
aVbut the destination is our minds
p396
aVand how we can reconnect
p397
aVwith the essential and with the magic.
p398
aVAnd it's what story cutting is all about.
