(lp3
VA few weeks ago, I had a chance to go to Saudi Arabia.
p4
aVAnd the first thing I wanted to do as a Muslim
p5
aVwas to go to Mecca and visit the Kaaba,
p6
aVthe holiest shrine of Islam.
p7
aVAnd I did that; I put on my ritualistic dress,
p8
aVI went to the holy mosque,
p9
aVI did my prayers,
p10
aVI observed all the rituals.
p11
aVAnd meanwhile, besides all the spirituality,
p12
aVthere was one mundane detail in the Kaaba
p13
aVthat was pretty interesting for me:
p14
aVthere was no separation of sexes.
p15
aVIn other words, men and women were worshiping all together.
p16
aVThey were together while doing taw\u0101f, the circular walk around the Kaaba.
p17
aVThey were together while praying.
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd if you wonder why this is interesting at all,
p20
aVyou have to see the rest of Saudi Arabia,
p21
aVbecause this a country which is strictly divided between the sexes.
p22
aVIn other words:
p23
aVas men, you are simply not supposed to be in the same physical space
p24
aVwith women.
p25
aVAnd I noticed this in a very funny way.
p26
aVI left the Kaaba to eat something in downtown Mecca.
p27
aVI headed to the nearest Burger King restaurant.
p28
aVAnd I went there \u2014 I noticed that there was a male section,
p29
aVwhich is carefully separated from the female section.
p30
aVI had to pay, order and eat in the male section.
p31
aV"It's funny," I said to myself,
p32
aV"You can mingle with the opposite sex at the holy Kaaba,
p33
aVbut not at the Burger King?"
p34
aa(lp35
V(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VQuite, quite ironic.
p38
aVIronic, and it's also, I think, quite telling,
p39
aVbecause the Kaaba and the rituals around it
p40
aVare relics from the earliest phase of Islam,
p41
aVthat of prophet Muhammad.
p42
aVAnd if there was a big emphasis at the time to separate men from women,
p43
aVthe rituals around the Kaaba could have been designed accordingly.
p44
aVBut apparently, that was not an issue at the time.
p45
aVSo the rituals came that way.
p46
aVThis is also, I think, confirmed by the fact
p47
aVthat the seclusion of women in creating a divided society
p48
aVis something that you also do not find in the Koran \u2014
p49
aVthe very core of Islam, the divine core of Islam \u2014
p50
aVthat all Muslims, equally myself, believe.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd I think it's not an accident
p53
aVthat you don't find this idea in the very origin of Islam,
p54
aVbecause many scholars who study the history of Islamic thought \u2014
p55
aVMuslim scholars or Westerners \u2014
p56
aVthink that, actually, the practice of dividing men and women physically
p57
aVcame as a later development in Islam,
p58
aVas Muslims adopted some preexisting cultures
p59
aVand traditions of the Middle East.
p60
aVSeclusion of women was actually a Byzantine and Persian practice,
p61
aVand Muslims adopted it and made it a part of their religion.
p62
aa(lp63
VActually, this is just one example of a much larger phenomenon.
p64
aVWhat we call today Islamic law, and especially Islamic culture \u2014
p65
aVand there are many Islamic cultures, actually;
p66
aVthe one in Saudi Arabia is much different
p67
aVfrom where I come from in Istanbul or Turkey.
p68
aVBut still, if you're going to speak about a Muslim culture,
p69
aVthis has a core: the divine message which began the religion.
p70
aVBut then many traditions, perceptions, practices were added on top of it.
p71
aVAnd these were traditions of the Middle East medieval traditions.
p72
aa(lp73
VThere are two important messages, or two lessons,
p74
aVto take from that reality.
p75
aVFirst of all, Muslims \u2014
p76
aVpious, conservative, believing Muslims who want to be loyal to their religion \u2014
p77
aVshould not cling onto everything in their culture,
p78
aVthinking that that's divinely mandated.
p79
aVMaybe some things are bad traditions and they need to be changed.
p80
aVOn the other hand, the Westerners who look at Islamic culture
p81
aVand see some troubling aspects
p82
aVshould not readily conclude that this is what Islam ordains.
p83
aVMaybe it's a Middle Eastern culture that became confused with Islam.
p84
aa(lp85
VThere is a practice called female circumcision.
p86
aVIt's something terrible, horrible.
p87
aVIt is basically an operation to deprive women of sexual pleasure.
p88
aVAnd Westerners \u2014
p89
aVEuropeans or Americans \u2014 who didn't know about this before,
p90
aV[saw] this practice
p91
aVwithin some of the Muslim communities who migrated from North Africa.
p92
aVAnd they've thought,
p93
aV"Oh, what a horrible religion that is, which ordains something like that."
p94
aVBut when you look at female circumcision,
p95
aVyou see that it has nothing to do with Islam;
p96
aVit's just a North African practice which predates Islam.
p97
aVIt was there for thousands of years.
p98
aVAnd, quite tellingly, some Muslims do practice it \u2014
p99
aVthe Muslims in North Africa, not in other places.
p100
aVBut also the non-Muslim communities of North Africa \u2014
p101
aVthe animists, some Christians and even a Jewish tribe in North Africa \u2014
p102
aVare known to practice female circumcision.
p103
aVSo what might look like a problem within Islamic faith
p104
aVmight turn out to be a tradition that Muslims have subscribed to.
p105
aa(lp106
VThe same thing can be said for honor killings,
p107
aVwhich is a recurrent theme in the Western media \u2014
p108
aVand which is, of course, a horrible tradition.
p109
aVAnd we see, truly, in some Muslim communities, that tradition.
p110
aVBut in the non-Muslim communities of the Middle East,
p111
aVsuch as some Christian communities, Eastern communities,
p112
aVyou see the same practice.
p113
aVWe had a tragic case of an honor killing
p114
aVwithin Turkey's Armenian community just a few months ago.
p115
aa(lp116
VNow, these are things about general culture,
p117
aVbut I'm also very much interested in political culture
p118
aVand whether liberty and democracy is appreciated,
p119
aVor whether there's an authoritarian political culture
p120
aVin which the state is supposed to impose things on the citizens.
p121
aVAnd it is no secret
p122
aVthat many Islamic movements in the Middle East
p123
aVtend to be authoritarian,
p124
aVand some of the so-called "Islamic regimes,"
p125
aVsuch as Saudi Arabia, Iran and the worst case, the Taliban in Afghanistan,
p126
aVthey are pretty authoritarian \u2014 no doubt about that.
p127
aa(lp128
VFor example, in Saudi Arabia,
p129
aVthere is a phenomenon called the religious police.
p130
aVAnd the religious police imposes the supposed Islamic way of life
p131
aVon every citizen, by force \u2014
p132
aVlike, women are forced to cover their heads \u2014
p133
aVwear the hijab, the Islamic head cover.
p134
aVNow that is pretty authoritarian,
p135
aVand that's something I'm very much critical of.
p136
aVBut when I realized that the non-Muslim,
p137
aVor the non-Islamic-minded actors in the same geography
p138
aVsometimes behaved similarly,
p139
aVI realized that the problem maybe lies
p140
aVin the political culture of the whole region, not just Islam.
p141
aVLet me give you an example: in Turkey, where I come from,
p142
aVwhich is a very hyper-secular republic,
p143
aVuntil very recently, we used to have what I call "secularism police,"
p144
aVwhich would guard the universities against veiled students.
p145
aVIn other words, they would force students to uncover their heads.
p146
aVAnd I think forcing people to uncover their head
p147
aVis as tyrannical as forcing them to cover it.
p148
aVIt should be the citizen's decision.
p149
aa(lp150
VBut when I saw that, I said,
p151
aV"Maybe the problem is just an authoritarian culture in the region,
p152
aVand some Muslims have been influenced by that.
p153
aVBut the secular-minded people can be influenced by that.
p154
aVMaybe it's a problem of the political culture,
p155
aVand we have to think about how to change that political culture."
p156
aVNow, these are some of the questions I had in mind a few years ago
p157
aVwhen I sat down to write a book.
p158
aVI said, "Well, I will do research
p159
aVabout how Islam actually came to be what it is today,
p160
aVand what roads were taken and what roads could have been taken."
p161
aVThe name of the book is "Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty."
p162
aVAnd as the subtitle suggests,
p163
aVI looked at Islamic tradition and the history of Islamic thought
p164
aVfrom the perspective of individual liberty,
p165
aVand I tried to find what are the strengths with regard to individual liberty.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd there are strengths in Islamic tradition.
p168
aVIslam, actually, as a monotheistic religion,
p169
aVwhich defined man as a responsible agent by itself,
p170
aVcreated the idea of the individual in the Middle East,
p171
aVand saved it from the communitarianism, the collectivism of the tribe.
p172
aVYou can derive many ideas from that.
p173
aVBut besides that, I also saw problems within Islamic tradition.
p174
aVBut one thing was curious:
p175
aVmost of those problems turn out to be problems that emerged later,
p176
aVnot from the very divine core of Islam, the Koran,
p177
aVbut from, again, traditions and mentalities,
p178
aVor the interpretations of the Koran that Muslims made in the Middle Ages.
p179
aVThe Koran, for example, doesn't condone stoning.
p180
aVThere is no punishment for apostasy.
p181
aVThere is no punishment for personal sins like drinking.
p182
aVThese things which make Islamic law,
p183
aVthe troubling aspects of Islamic law,
p184
aVwere developed into later interpretations of Islam.
p185
aa(lp186
VWhich means that Muslims can, today,
p187
aVlook at those things and say,
p188
aV"Well, the core of our religion is here to stay with us.
p189
aVIt's our faith, and we will be loyal to it.
p190
aVBut we can change how it was interpreted,
p191
aVbecause it was interpreted according to the time
p192
aVand milieu in the Middle Ages.
p193
aVNow we're living in a different world,
p194
aVwith different values and political systems."
p195
aVThat interpretation is quite possible and feasible.
p196
aa(lp197
VNow, if I were the only person thinking that way,
p198
aVwe would be in trouble.
p199
aVBut that's not the case at all.
p200
aVActually, from the 19th century on,
p201
aVthere's a whole revisionist, reformist \u2014 whatever you call it \u2014 tradition,
p202
aVa trend in Islamic thinking.
p203
aVThese were intellectuals or statesmen
p204
aVof the 19th century, and later, 20th century,
p205
aVwhich looked at Europe, basically,
p206
aVand saw that Europe has many things to admire,
p207
aVlike science and technology.
p208
aVBut not just that; also democracy, parliament,
p209
aVthe idea of representation,
p210
aVthe idea of equal citizenship.
p211
aVThese Muslim thinkers, intellectuals and statesmen of the 19th century,
p212
aVlooked at Europe, saw these things, and said,
p213
aV"Why don't we have these things?"
p214
aVAnd they looked back at Islamic tradition,
p215
aVand saw that there are problematic aspects,
p216
aVbut they're not the core of the religion, so maybe they can be re-understood,
p217
aVand the Koran can be reread in the modern world.
p218
aa(lp219
VThat trend is generally called Islamic modernism,
p220
aVand it was advanced by intellectuals and statesmen,
p221
aVnot just as an intellectual idea, though,
p222
aVbut also as a political program.
p223
aVAnd that's why, actually, in the 19th century,
p224
aVthe Ottoman Empire, which then covered the whole Middle East,
p225
aVmade very important reforms \u2014
p226
aVreforms like giving Christians and Jews an equal citizenship status,
p227
aVaccepting a constitution,
p228
aVaccepting a representative parliament,
p229
aVadvancing the idea of freedom of religion.
p230
aVThat's why the Ottoman Empire, in its last decades,
p231
aVturned into a proto-democracy, a constitutional monarchy,
p232
aVand freedom was a very important political value at the time.
p233
aa(lp234
VSimilarly, in the Arab world,
p235
aVthere was what the great Arab historian Albert Hourani defines
p236
aVas the Liberal Age.
p237
aVHe has a book, "Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age,"
p238
aVand the Liberal Age, he defines as 19th century and early 20th century.
p239
aVQuite notably, this was the dominant trend in the early 20th century
p240
aVamong Islamic thinkers and statesmen and theologians.
p241
aVBut there is a very curious pattern in the rest of the 20th century,
p242
aVbecause we see a sharp decline in this Islamic modernist line.
p243
aVAnd in place of that,
p244
aVwhat happens is that Islamism grows as an ideology which is authoritarian,
p245
aVwhich is quite strident,
p246
aVwhich is quite anti-Western,
p247
aVand which wants to shape society based on a utopian vision.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo Islamism is the problematic idea
p250
aVthat really created a lot of problems in the 20th-century Islamic world.
p251
aVAnd even the very extreme forms of Islamism
p252
aVled to terrorism in the name of Islam \u2014
p253
aVwhich is actually a practice that I think is against Islam,
p254
aVbut some, obviously, extremists, did not think that way.
p255
aVBut there is a curious question:
p256
aVIf Islamic modernism was so popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries,
p257
aVwhy did Islamism become so popular in the rest of the 20th century?
p258
aVAnd this is a question, I think, which needs to be discussed carefully.
p259
aVIn my book, I went into that question as well.
p260
aVAnd actually, you don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand that.
p261
aVJust look at the political history of the 20th century,
p262
aVand you see things have changed a lot.
p263
aVThe contexts have changed.
p264
aa(lp265
VIn the 19th century,
p266
aVwhen Muslims were looking at Europe as an example,
p267
aVthey were independent; they were more self-confident.
p268
aVIn the early 20th century, with the fall of the Ottoman Empire,
p269
aVthe whole Middle East was colonized.
p270
aVAnd when you have colonialization, what do you have?
p271
aVYou have anti-colonialization.
p272
aVSo Europe is not just an example now to emulate;
p273
aVit's an enemy to fight and to resist.
p274
aVSo there's a very sharp decline in liberal ideas in the Muslim world,
p275
aVand what you see is more of a defensive, rigid, reactionary strain,
p276
aVwhich led to Arab socialism, Arab nationalism
p277
aVand ultimately to the Islamist ideology.
p278
aVAnd when the colonial period ended,
p279
aVwhat you had in place of that was generally secular dictators,
p280
aVwhich say they're a country,
p281
aVbut did not bring democracy to the country,
p282
aVand established their own dictatorship.
p283
aVAnd I think the West, at least some powers in the West,
p284
aVparticularly the United States,
p285
aVmade the mistake of supporting those secular dictators,
p286
aVthinking that they were more helpful for their interests.
p287
aVBut the fact that those dictators suppressed democracy in their country
p288
aVand suppressed Islamic groups in their country
p289
aVactually made the Islamists much more strident.
p290
aa(lp291
VSo in the 20th century,
p292
aVyou had this vicious cycle in the Arab world,
p293
aVwhere you have a dictatorship suppressing its own people,
p294
aVincluding the Islamic pious,
p295
aVand they're reacting in reactionary ways.
p296
aVThere was one country, though,
p297
aVwhich was able to escape or stay away from that vicious cycle.
p298
aVAnd that's the country where I come from, Turkey.
p299
aVTurkey has never been colonized,
p300
aVso it remained as an independent nation after the fall of the Ottoman Empire.
p301
aVThat's one thing to remember;
p302
aVit did not share the same anti-colonial hype
p303
aVthat you can find in some other countries in the region.
p304
aVSecondly, and most importantly,
p305
aVTurkey became a democracy
p306
aVearlier than any of the countries we are talking about.
p307
aVIn 1950, Turkey had the first free and fair elections,
p308
aVwhich ended the more autocratic secular regime,
p309
aVwhich was in the beginning of Turkey.
p310
aVAnd the pious Muslims in Turkey
p311
aVsaw that they could change the political system by voting.
p312
aVAnd they realized that democracy is something compatible with Islam,
p313
aVcompatible with their values,
p314
aVand they've been supportive of democracy.
p315
aVThat's an experience
p316
aVthat not every other Muslim nation in the Middle East had,
p317
aVuntil very recently.
p318
aa(lp319
VSecondly, in the past two decades,
p320
aVthanks to globalization, thanks to the market economy,
p321
aVthanks to the rise of a middle class,
p322
aVwe in Turkey see what I define as a rebirth of Islamic modernism.
p323
aVNow, there's the more urban middle-class pious Muslims
p324
aVwho, again, look at their tradition
p325
aVand see that there are some problems in the tradition,
p326
aVand understand that they need to be changed and questioned and reformed.
p327
aVAnd they look at Europe, and see an example, again, to follow.
p328
aVThey see an example, at least, to take some inspiration from.
p329
aVThat's why the EU process, Turkey's effort to join the EU,
p330
aVhas been supported inside Turkey by the Islamic pious,
p331
aVwhile some secular nationalists were against it.
p332
aVWell, that process has been a little bit blurred
p333
aVby the fact that not all Europeans are that welcoming,
p334
aVbut that's another discussion.
p335
aVBut the pro-EU sentiment in Turkey in the past decade
p336
aVhas become almost an Islamic cause and supported by the Islamic liberals
p337
aVand the secular liberals as well, of course.
p338
aa(lp339
VAnd thanks to that,
p340
aVTurkey has been able to reasonably create a success story
p341
aVin which Islam and the most pious understandings of Islam
p342
aVhave become part of the democratic game,
p343
aVand even contributes to the democratic and economic advance of the country.
p344
aVAnd this has been an inspiring example right now
p345
aVfor some of the Islamic movements
p346
aVor some of the countries in the Arab world.
p347
aa(lp348
VYou must have all seen the Arab Spring,
p349
aVwhich began in Tunis and in Egypt.
p350
aVArab masses just revolted against their dictators.
p351
aVThey were asking for democracy; they were asking for freedom.
p352
aVAnd they did not turn out to be the Islamist boogeyman
p353
aVthat the dictators were always using to justify their regime.
p354
aVThey said, "We want freedom; we want democracy.
p355
aVWe are Muslim believers,
p356
aVbut we want to be living as free people in free societies."
p357
aVOf course, this is a long road.
p358
aVDemocracy is not an overnight achievement; it's a process.
p359
aVBut this is a promising era in the Muslim world.
p360
aa(lp361
VAnd I believe that the Islamic modernism which began in the 19th century,
p362
aVbut which had a setback in the 20th century
p363
aVbecause of the political troubles of the Muslim world,
p364
aVis having a rebirth.
p365
aVAnd I think the takeaway message from that would be that Islam,
p366
aVdespite some of the skeptics in the West,
p367
aVhas the potential in itself
p368
aVto create its own way to democracy, create its own way to liberalism,
p369
aVcreate its own way to freedom.
p370
aVThey just should be allowed to work for that.
p371
aa(lp372
VThanks so much.
