VThis is an image of the planet Earth.
p4
aVIt looks very much like the Apollo pictures
p5
aVthat are very well known.
p6
aVThere is something different;
p7
aVyou can click on it,
p8
aVand if you click on it,
p9
aVyou can zoom in on almost any place on the Earth.
p10
aVFor instance, this is a bird's-eye view
p11
aVof the EPFL campus.
p12
aVIn many cases, you can also see
p13
aVhow a building looks from a nearby street.
p14
aVThis is pretty amazing.
p15
aVBut there's something missing in this wonderful tour:
p16
aVIt's time.
p17
aVi'm not really sure when this picture was taken.
p18
aVI'm not even sure it was taken
p19
aVat the same moment as the bird's-eye view.
p20
aVIn my lab, we develop tools
p21
aVto travel not only in space
p22
aVbut also through time.
p23
aVThe kind of question we're asking is
p24
aVIs it possible to build something
p25
aVlike Google Maps of the past?
p26
aVCan I add a slider on top of Google Maps
p27
aVand just change the year,
p28
aVseeing how it was 100 years before,
p29
aV1,000 years before?
p30
aVIs that possible?
p31
aVCan I reconstruct social networks of the past?
p32
aVCan I make a Facebook of the Middle Ages?
p33
aVSo, can I build time machines?
p34
aVMaybe we can just say, "No, it's not possible."
p35
aVOr, maybe, we can think of it from an information point of view.
p36
aVThis is what I call the information mushroom.
p37
aVVertically, you have the time.
p38
aVand horizontally, the amount of digital information available.
p39
aVObviously, in the last 10 years, we have much information.
p40
aVAnd obviously the more we go in the past, the less information we have.
p41
aVIf we want to build something like Google Maps of the past,
p42
aVor Facebook of the past,
p43
aVwe need to enlarge this space,
p44
aVwe need to make that like a rectangle.
p45
aVHow do we do that?
p46
aVOne way is digitization.
p47
aVThere's a lot of material available \u2014
p48
aVnewspaper, printed books, thousands of printed books.
p49
aVI can digitize all these.
p50
aVI can extract information from these.
p51
aVOf course, the more you go in the past, the less information you will have.
p52
aVSo, it might not be enough.
p53
aVSo, I can do what historians do.
p54
aVI can extrapolate.
p55
aVThis is what we call, in computer science, simulation.
p56
aVIf I take a log book,
p57
aVI can consider, it's not just a log book
p58
aVof a Venetian captain going to a particular journey.
p59
aVI can consider it is actually a log book
p60
aVwhich is representative of many journeys of that period.
p61
aVI'm extrapolating.
p62
aVIf I have a painting of a facade,
p63
aVI can consider it's not just that particular building,
p64
aVbut probably it also shares the same grammar
p65
aVof buildings where we lost any information.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo if we want to construct a time machine,
p68
aVwe need two things.
p69
aVWe need very large archives,
p70
aVand we need excellent specialists.
p71
aVThe Venice Time Machine,
p72
aVthe project I'm going to talk to you about,
p73
aVis a joint project between the EPFL
p74
aVand the University of Venice Ca'Foscari.
p75
aa(lp76
VThere's something very peculiar about Venice,
p77
aVthat its administration has been
p78
aVvery, very bureaucratic.
p79
aVThey've been keeping track of everything,
p80
aValmost like Google today.
p81
aVAt the Archivio di Stato,
p82
aVyou have 80 kilometers of archives
p83
aVdocumenting every aspect
p84
aVof the life of Venice over more than 1,000 years.
p85
aVYou have every boat that goes out,
p86
aVevery boat that comes in.
p87
aVYou have every change that was made in the city.
p88
aVThis is all there.
p89
aVWe are setting up a 10-year digitization program
p90
aVwhich has the objective of transforming
p91
aVthis immense archive
p92
aVinto a giant information system.
p93
aVThe type of objective we want to reach
p94
aVis 450 books a day that can be digitized.
p95
aVOf course, when you digitize, that's not enough,
p96
aVbecause these documents,
p97
aVmost of them are in Latin, in Tuscan,
p98
aVin Venetian dialect,
p99
aVso you need to transcribe them,
p100
aVto translate them in some cases,
p101
aVto index them,
p102
aVand this is obviously not easy.
p103
aVIn particular, traditional optical character recognition method
p104
aVthat can be used for printed manuscripts,
p105
aVthey do not work well on the handwritten document.
p106
aVSo the solution is actually to take inspiration
p107
aVfrom another domain: speech recognition.
p108
aVThis is a domain of something  that seems impossible,
p109
aVwhich can actually be done,
p110
aVsimply by putting additional constraints.
p111
aVIf you have a very good model
p112
aVof a language which is used,
p113
aVif you have a very good model of a document,
p114
aVhow well they are structured.
p115
aVAnd these are administrative documents.
p116
aVThey are well structured in many cases.
p117
aVIf you divide this huge archive into smaller subsets
p118
aVwhere a smaller subset actually shares similar features,
p119
aVthen there's a chance of success.
p120
aa(lp121
VIf we reach that stage, then there's something else:
p122
aVwe can extract from this document events.
p123
aVActually probably 10 billion events
p124
aVcan be extracted from this archive.
p125
aVAnd this giant information system
p126
aVcan be searched in many ways.
p127
aVYou can ask questions like,
p128
aV"Who lived in this palazzo in 1323?"
p129
aV"How much cost a sea bream at the Realto market
p130
aVin 1434?"
p131
aV"What was the salary
p132
aVof a glass maker in Murano
p133
aVmaybe over a decade?"
p134
aVYou can ask even bigger questions
p135
aVbecause it will be semantically coded.
p136
aVAnd then what you can do is put that in space,
p137
aVbecause much of this information is spatial.
p138
aVAnd from that, you can do things like
p139
aVreconstructing this extraordinary journey
p140
aVof that city that managed to have a sustainable development
p141
aVover a thousand years,
p142
aVmanaging to have all the time
p143
aVa form of equilibrium with its environment.
p144
aVYou can reconstruct that journey,
p145
aVvisualize it in many different ways.
p146
aVBut of course, you cannot understand  Venice if you just look at the city.
p147
aVYou have to put it in a larger European context.
p148
aVSo the idea is also to document all the things
p149
aVthat worked at the European level.
p150
aVWe can reconstruct also the journey
p151
aVof the Venetian maritime empire,
p152
aVhow it progressively controlled the Adriatic Sea,
p153
aVhow it became the most powerful medieval empire
p154
aVof its time,
p155
aVcontrolling most of the sea routes
p156
aVfrom the east to the south.
p157
aa(lp158
VBut you can even do other things,
p159
aVbecause in these maritime routes,
p160
aVthere are regular patterns.
p161
aVYou can go one step beyond
p162
aVand actually create a simulation system,
p163
aVcreate a Mediterranean simulator
p164
aVwhich is capable actually of reconstructing
p165
aVeven the information we are missing,
p166
aVwhich would enable us to have  questions you could ask
p167
aVlike if you were using a route planner.
p168
aa(lp169
V"If I am in Corfu in June 1323
p170
aVand want to go to Constantinople,
p171
aVwhere can I take a boat?"
p172
aa(lp173
VProbably we can answer this question
p174
aVwith one or two or three days' precision.
p175
aa(lp176
V"How much will it cost?"
p177
aa(lp178
V"What are the chance of encountering pirates?"
p179
aa(lp180
VOf course, you understand,
p181
aVthe central scientific challenge of a project like this one
p182
aVis qualifying, quantifying and representing
p183
aVuncertainty and inconsistency at each step of this process.
p184
aVThere are errors everywhere,
p185
aVerrors in the document, it's the wrong name of the captain,
p186
aVsome of the boats never actually took to sea.
p187
aVThere are errors in translation, interpretative biases,
p188
aVand on top of that, if you add algorithmic processes,
p189
aVyou're going to have errors in recognition,
p190
aVerrors in extraction,
p191
aVso you have very, very uncertain data.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo how can we detect and correct these inconsistencies?
p194
aVHow can we represent that form of uncertainty?
p195
aVIt's difficult. One thing you can do
p196
aVis document each step of the process,
p197
aVnot only coding the historical information
p198
aVbut what we call the meta-historical information,
p199
aVhow is historical knowledge constructed,
p200
aVdocumenting each step.
p201
aVThat will not guarantee that we actually converge
p202
aVtoward a single story of Venice,
p203
aVbut probably we can actually reconstruct
p204
aVa fully documented potential story of Venice.
p205
aVMaybe there's not a single map.
p206
aVMaybe there are several maps.
p207
aVThe system should allow for that,
p208
aVbecause we have to deal with a new form of uncertainty,
p209
aVwhich is really new for this type of giant databases.
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd how should we communicate
p212
aVthis new research to a large audience?
p213
aVAgain, Venice is extraordinary for that.
p214
aVWith the millions of visitors that come every year,
p215
aVit's actually one of the best places
p216
aVto try to invent the museum of the future.
p217
aVImagine, horizontally you see the reconstructed map
p218
aVof a given year,
p219
aVand vertically, you see the document
p220
aVthat served the reconstruction,
p221
aVpaintings, for instance.
p222
aVImagine an immersive system that permits
p223
aVto go and dive and reconstruct the Venice of a given year,
p224
aVsome experience you could share within a group.
p225
aVOn the contrary, imagine actually that you start
p226
aVfrom a document, a Venetian manuscript,
p227
aVand you show, actually, what you can construct out of it,
p228
aVhow it is decoded,
p229
aVhow the context of that document can be recreated.
p230
aVThis is an image from an exhibit
p231
aVwhich is currently conducted in Geneva
p232
aVwith that type of system.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo to conclude, we can say that
p235
aVresearch in the humanities is about to undergo
p236
aVan evolution which is maybe similar
p237
aVto what happened to life sciences 30 years ago.
p238
aVIt's really a question of scale.
p239
aVWe see projects which are
p240
aVmuch beyond any single research team can do,
p241
aVand this is really new for the humanities,
p242
aVwhich very often take the habit of working
p243
aVin small groups or only with a couple of researchers.
p244
aVWhen you visit the Archivio di Stato,
p245
aVyou feel this is beyond what any single team can do,
p246
aVand that should be a joint and common effort.
p247
aVSo what we must do for this paradigm shift
p248
aVis actually foster a new generation
p249
aVof "digital humanists"
p250
aVthat are going to be ready for this shift.
