VWhen I go to parties,
p4
aVit doesn't usually take very long
p5
aVfor people to find out
p6
aVthat I'm a scientist and I study sex.
p7
aVAnd then I get asked questions.
p8
aVAnd the questions usually have a very particular format.
p9
aVThey start with the phrase,
p10
aV"A friend told me,"
p11
aVand then they end with the phrase,
p12
aV"Is this true?"
p13
aVAnd most of the time
p14
aVI'm glad to say that I can answer them,
p15
aVbut sometimes I have to say,
p16
aV"I'm really sorry,
p17
aVbut I don't know
p18
aVbecause I'm not that kind of a doctor."
p19
aa(lp20
VThat is, I'm not a clinician,
p21
aVI'm a comparative biologist who studies anatomy.
p22
aVAnd my job is to look at lots of different species of animals
p23
aVand try to figure out how their tissues and organs work
p24
aVwhen everything's going right,
p25
aVrather than trying to figure out
p26
aVhow to fix things when they go wrong,
p27
aVlike so many of you.
p28
aVAnd what I do is I look for similarities and differences
p29
aVin the solutions that they've evolved
p30
aVfor fundamental biological problems.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo today I'm here to argue
p33
aVthat this is not at all
p34
aVan esoteric Ivory Tower activity
p35
aVthat we find at our universities,
p36
aVbut that broad study
p37
aVacross species, tissue types and organ systems
p38
aVcan produce insights
p39
aVthat have direct implications for human health.
p40
aVAnd this is true both of my recent project
p41
aVon sex differences in the brain,
p42
aVand my more mature work
p43
aVon the anatomy and function of penises.
p44
aVAnd now you know why I'm fun at parties.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VSo today I'm going to give you an example
p49
aVdrawn from my penis study
p50
aVto show you how knowledge
p51
aVdrawn from studies of one organ system
p52
aVprovided insights into a very different one.
p53
aVNow I'm sure as everyone in the audience already knows \u2014
p54
aVI did have to explain it to my nine-year-old late last week \u2014
p55
aVpenises are structures that transfer sperm
p56
aVfrom one individual to another.
p57
aVAnd the slide behind me
p58
aVbarely scratches the surface
p59
aVof how widespread they are in animals.
p60
aVThere's an enormous amount of anatomical variation.
p61
aVYou find muscular tubes, modified legs, modified fins,
p62
aVas well as the mammalian fleshy, inflatable cylinder
p63
aVthat we're all familiar with \u2014
p64
aVor at least half of you are.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd I think we see this tremendous variation
p69
aVbecause it's a really effective solution
p70
aVto a very basic biological problem,
p71
aVand that is getting sperm in a position
p72
aVto meet up with eggs and form zygotes.
p73
aVNow the penis isn't actually required for internal fertiliztion,
p74
aVbut when internal fertilization evolves,
p75
aVpenises often follow.
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd the question I get when I start talking about this most often is,
p78
aV"What made you interested in this subject?"
p79
aVAnd the answer is skeletons.
p80
aVYou wouldn't think that skeletons and penises
p81
aVhave very much to do with one another.
p82
aVAnd that's because we tend to think of skeletons
p83
aVas stiff lever systems
p84
aVthat produce speed or power.
p85
aVAnd my first forays into biological research,
p86
aVdoing dinosaur paleontology as an undergraduate,
p87
aVwere really squarely in that realm.
p88
aa(lp89
VBut when I went to graduate school to study biomechanics,
p90
aVI really wanted to find a dissertation project
p91
aVthat would expand our knowledge of skeletal function.
p92
aVI tried a bunch of different stuff.
p93
aVA lot of it didn't pan out.
p94
aVBut then one day I started thinking
p95
aVabout the mammalian penis.
p96
aVAnd it's really an odd sort of structure.
p97
aVBefore it can be used for internal fertilization,
p98
aVits mechanical behavior has to change
p99
aVin a really dramatic fashion.
p100
aVMost of the time it's a flexible organ.
p101
aVIt's easy to bend.
p102
aVBut before it's brought into use
p103
aVduring copulation
p104
aVit has to become rigid,
p105
aVit has to become difficult to bend.
p106
aVAnd moreover, it has to work.
p107
aVA reproductive system that fails to function
p108
aVproduces an individual that has no offspring,
p109
aVand that individual is then kicked out of the gene pool.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd so I thought, "Here's a problem
p112
aVthat just cries out for a skeletal system \u2014
p113
aVnot one like this one,
p114
aVbut one like this one \u2014
p115
aVbecause, functionally,
p116
aVa skeleton is any system
p117
aVthat supports tissue and transmits forces.
p118
aVAnd I already knew that animals like this earthworm,
p119
aVindeed most animals,
p120
aVdon't support their tissues
p121
aVby draping them over bones.
p122
aVInstead they're more like reinforced water balloons.
p123
aVThey use a skeleton that we call a hydrostatic skeleton.
p124
aVAnd a hydrostatic skeleton
p125
aVuses two elements.
p126
aVThe skeletal support comes from an interaction
p127
aVbetween a pressurized fluid
p128
aVand a surrounding wall of tissue
p129
aVthat's held in tension and reinforced with fibrous proteins.
p130
aVAnd the interaction is crucial.
p131
aVWithout both elements you have no support.
p132
aVIf you have fluid
p133
aVwith no wall to surround it
p134
aVand keep pressure up,
p135
aVyou have a puddle.
p136
aVAnd if you have just the wall
p137
aVwith no fluid inside of it to put the wall in tension,
p138
aVyou've got a little wet rag.
p139
aa(lp140
VWhen you look at a penis in cross section,
p141
aVit has a lot of the hallmarks
p142
aVof a hydrostatic skeleton.
p143
aVIt has a central space
p144
aVof spongy erectile tissue
p145
aVthat fills with fluid \u2014 in this case blood \u2014
p146
aVsurrounded by a wall of tissue
p147
aVthat's rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen.
p148
aa(lp149
VBut at the time when I started this project,
p150
aVthe best explanation I could find for penal erection
p151
aVwas that the wall surrounded these spongy tissues,
p152
aVand the spongy tissues filled with blood
p153
aVand pressure rose and voila! it became erect.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd that explained to me expansion \u2014
p156
aVmade sense: more fluid, you get tissues that expand \u2014
p157
aVbut it didn't actually explain erection.
p158
aVBecause there was no mechanism in this explanation
p159
aVfor making this structure hard to bend.
p160
aVAnd no one had systematically looked at the wall tissue.
p161
aVSo I thought, wall tissue's important in skeletons.
p162
aVIt has to be part of the explanation.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd this was the point
p165
aVat which my graduate adviser said,
p166
aV"Whoa! Hold on. Slow down."
p167
aVBecause after about six months of me talking about this,
p168
aVI think he finally figured out
p169
aVthat I was really serious about the penis thing.
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VSo he sat me down, and he warned me.
p174
aVHe was like, "Be careful going down this path.
p175
aVI'm not sure this project's going to pan out."
p176
aVBecause he was afraid I was walking into a trap.
p177
aVI was taking on a socially embarrassing question
p178
aVwith an answer that he thought
p179
aVmight not be particularly interesting.
p180
aVAnd that was because
p181
aVevery hydrostatic skeleton
p182
aVthat we had found in nature up to that point
p183
aVhad the same basic elements.
p184
aVIt had the central fluid,
p185
aVit had the surrounding wall,
p186
aVand the reinforcing fibers in the wall
p187
aVwere arranged in crossed helices
p188
aVaround the long axis of the skeleton.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo the image behind me
p191
aVshows a piece of tissue
p192
aVin one of these cross helical skeletons
p193
aVcut so that you're looking at the surface of the wall.
p194
aVThe arrow shows you the long axis.
p195
aVAnd you can see two layers of fibers,
p196
aVone in blue and one in yellow,
p197
aVarranged in left-handed and right-handed angles.
p198
aVAnd if you weren't just looking at a little section of the fibers,
p199
aVthose fibers would be going in helices
p200
aVaround the long axis of the skeleton \u2014
p201
aVsomething like a Chinese finger trap,
p202
aVwhere you stick your fingers in and they get stuck.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd these skeletons have a particular set of behaviors,
p205
aVwhich I'm going to demonstrate in a film.
p206
aVIt's a model skeleton
p207
aVthat I made out of a piece of cloth
p208
aVthat I wrapped around an inflated balloon.
p209
aVThe cloth's cut on the bias.
p210
aVSo you can see that the fibers wrap in helices,
p211
aVand those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves,
p212
aVwhich means the skeleton's flexible.
p213
aVIt lengthens, shortens and bends really easily
p214
aVin response to internal or external forces.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow my adviser's concern
p217
aVwas what if the penile wall tissue
p218
aVis just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton.
p219
aVWhat are you going to contribute?
p220
aVWhat new thing are you contributing
p221
aVto our knowledge of biology?
p222
aVAnd I thought, "Yeah, he does have a really good point here."
p223
aVSo I spent a long, long time thinking about it.
p224
aVAnd one thing kept bothering me,
p225
aVand that's, when they're functioning,
p226
aVpenises don't wiggle.
p227
aV(Laughter)
p228
aVSo something interesting had to be going on.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo I went ahead, collected wall tissue,
p231
aVprepared it so it was erect,
p232
aVsectioned it, put it on slides
p233
aVand then stuck it under the microscope to have a look,
p234
aVfully expecting to see crossed helices of collagen of some variety.
p235
aVBut instead I saw this.
p236
aVThere's an outer layer and an inner layer.
p237
aVThe arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton.
p238
aa(lp239
VI was really surprised at this.
p240
aVEveryone I showed it
p241
aVwas really surprised at this.
p242
aVWhy was everyone surprised at this?
p243
aVThat's because we knew theoretically
p244
aVthat there was another way
p245
aVof arranging fibers in a hydrostatic skeleton,
p246
aVand that was with fibers at zero degrees
p247
aVand 90 degrees to the long axis of the structure.
p248
aVThe thing is, no one had ever seen it before in nature.
p249
aVAnd now I was looking at one.
p250
aa(lp251
VThose fibers in that particular orientation
p252
aVgive the skeleton a very, very different behavior.
p253
aVI'm going to show a model
p254
aVmade out of exactly the same materials.
p255
aVSo it'll be made of the same cotton cloth,
p256
aVsame balloon, same internal pressure.
p257
aVBut the only difference
p258
aVis that the fibers are arranged differently.
p259
aVAnd you'll see that, unlike the cross helical model,
p260
aVthis model resists extension and contraction
p261
aVand resists bending.
p262
aa(lp263
VNow what that tells us
p264
aVis that wall tissues are doing so much more
p265
aVthan just covering the vascular tissues.
p266
aVThey're an integral part of the penile skeleton.
p267
aVIf the wall around the erectile tissue wasn't there,
p268
aVif it wasn't reinforced in this way,
p269
aVthe shape would change,
p270
aVbut the inflated penis would not resist bending,
p271
aVand erection simply wouldn't work.
p272
aa(lp273
VIt's an observation with obvious medical applications
p274
aVin humans as well,
p275
aVbut it's also relevant in a broad sense, I think,
p276
aVto the design of prosthetics, soft robots,
p277
aVbasically anything
p278
aVwhere changes of shape and stiffness are important.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo to sum up:
p281
aVTwenty years ago,
p282
aVI had a college adviser tell me,
p283
aVwhen I went to the college and said,
p284
aV"I'm kind of interested in anatomy,"
p285
aVthey said, "Anatomy's a dead science."
p286
aVHe couldn't have been more wrong.
p287
aVI really believe that we still have a lot to learn
p288
aVabout the normal structure and function of our bodies.
p289
aVNot just about its genetics and molecular biology,
p290
aVbut up here in the meat end of the scale.
p291
aVWe've got limits on our time.
p292
aVWe often focus on one disease,
p293
aVone model, one problem,
p294
aVbut my experience suggests
p295
aVthat we should take the time
p296
aVto apply ideas broadly between systems
p297
aVand just see where it takes us.
p298
aVAfter all, if ideas about invertebrate skeletons
p299
aVcan give us insights
p300
aVabout mammalian reproductive systems,
p301
aVthere could be lots of other wild and productive connections
p302
aVlurking out there just waiting to be found.
p303

VThank you.
