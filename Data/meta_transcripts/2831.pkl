VSo, imagine that you take a 19-hour, very long drive
p4
aVto Disney World,
p5
aVwith two kids in the back seat.
p6
aVAnd 15 minutes into this 19-hour trip,
p7
aVthe immutable laws of nature dictate
p8
aVthat you get the question:
p9
aV"Are we there yet?"
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VSo you answer this question a hundred more times, easily,
p14
aVin the negative,
p15
aVbut you finally arrive.
p16
aVYou have a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful trip.
p17
aVYou drive 19 long hours back home.
p18
aVAnd when you get there,
p19
aVthe police are waiting on you.
p20
aVThey accuse you of committing a crime
p21
aVthat occurred while you were away in Florida.
p22
aVYou tell anybody and everybody who will listen,
p23
aV"I didn't do it!
p24
aVI couldn't have done it!
p25
aVI was hanging out with Mickey and Minnie and my kids!"
p26
aVBut no one believes you.
p27
aVUltimately, you're arrested,
p28
aVyou're tried,
p29
aVyou're convicted
p30
aVand you are sentenced.
p31
aVAnd you spend 25 years in jail,
p32
aVuntil someone comes along and proves \u2014
p33
aVhas the evidence to prove \u2014
p34
aVthat you actually were in Florida
p35
aVwhen this crime was committed.
p36
aVSo.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo, I'm a Harvard Law professor,
p39
aVand the last several years, I have worked on
p40
aVwinning the release of innocent people
p41
aVwho've been wrongfully convicted \u2014
p42
aVpeople like Jonathan Fleming,
p43
aVwho spent 24 years, eight months in jail
p44
aVfor a murder that was committed in Brooklyn, New York,
p45
aVwhile he was in Disney World
p46
aVwith his kids.
p47
aVHow do we know this?
p48
aVBecause when he was arrested,
p49
aVamong his property in his back pocket
p50
aVwas a receipt \u2014
p51
aVtime-stamped receipt
p52
aVthat showed that he was in Disney World.
p53
aVThat receipt was put in the police file,
p54
aVa copy of it was put in the prosecutor's file,
p55
aVand they never gave it to his public defender.
p56
aVIn fact, nobody even knew it was there.
p57
aVIt just sat there for 20-some-odd years.
p58
aVMy team looked through the file, and we found it,
p59
aVdid the rest of the investigation,
p60
aVand figured out someone else committed the crime.
p61
aVMr. Fleming was in Disney World,
p62
aVand he is now released.
p63
aa(lp64
VLet me give you a little bit of context.
p65
aVSo about three years ago, I got a call from the Brooklyn District Attorney.
p66
aVHe asked whether I'd be interested in designing a program
p67
aVcalled a "conviction review unit."
p68
aVSo I said yes.
p69
aVA conviction review unit is essentially a unit in a prosecutor's office
p70
aVwhere prosecutors look at their past cases
p71
aVto determine whether or not they made mistakes.
p72
aVOver the course of the first year,
p73
aVwe found about 13 wrongful convictions,
p74
aVpeople having been in jail for decades,
p75
aVand we released all of them.
p76
aVIt was the most in New York history.
p77
aVThe program is still going on,
p78
aVand they're up to 21 releases now \u2014
p79
aV21 people who spent significant time behind bars.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo let me tell you about a couple other of the men and women
p82
aVthat I interacted with in the course of this program.
p83
aVOne name is Roger Logan.
p84
aVMr. Logan had been in jail 17 years
p85
aVand wrote me a letter.
p86
aVIt was a simple letter; it basically said,
p87
aV"Professor Sullivan, I'm innocent. I've been framed.
p88
aVCan you look at my case?"
p89
aVAt first blush, the case seemed like it was open and shut,
p90
aVbut my research had shown
p91
aVthat single-witness identification cases
p92
aVare prone to error.
p93
aVIt doesn't mean he was innocent,
p94
aVit just means we ought to look a little bit closer at those cases.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo we did.
p97
aVAnd the facts were relatively simple.
p98
aVThe eyewitness said she heard a shot,
p99
aVand she ran to the next building and turned around and looked,
p100
aVand there was Mr. Logan.
p101
aVAnd he was tried and convicted and in jail for 17-some-odd years.
p102
aVBut it was a single-witness case, so we took a look at it.
p103
aVI sent some people to the scene, and there was an inconsistency.
p104
aVAnd to put it politely:
p105
aVUsain Bolt couldn't have run from where she said she was
p106
aVto the other spot.
p107
aVRight?
p108
aVSo we knew that wasn't true.
p109
aVSo it still didn't mean that he didn't do it,
p110
aVbut we knew something was maybe fishy about this witness.
p111
aVSo we looked through the file,
p112
aVa piece of paper in the file had a number on it.
p113
aVThe number indicated that this witness had a record.
p114
aVWe went back through 20 years of non-digitized papers
p115
aVto figure out what this record was about,
p116
aVand it turned out \u2014 it turned out \u2014
p117
aVthe eyewitness was in jail
p118
aVwhen she said she saw what she saw.
p119
aVThe man spent 17 years behind bars.
p120
aa(lp121
VThe last one is a case about two boys,
p122
aVWillie Stuckey, David McCallum.
p123
aVThey were arrested at 15,
p124
aVand their conviction was vacated 29 years later.
p125
aVNow this was a case,
p126
aVonce again \u2014 first blush, it looked open and shut.
p127
aVThey had confessed.
p128
aVBut my research showed that juvenile confessions
p129
aVwithout a parent present
p130
aVare prone to error.
p131
aVThe DNA cases proved this several times.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo we took a close look.
p134
aVWe looked at the confession,
p135
aVand it turned out,
p136
aVthere was something in the confession
p137
aVthat those boys could not have known.
p138
aVThe only people who knew it were police and prosecutors.
p139
aVWe knew what really happened;
p140
aVsomeone told them to say this.
p141
aVWe don't exactly know who,
p142
aVwhich person did,
p143
aVbut any rate, the confession was coerced,
p144
aVwe determined.
p145
aVWe then went back and did forensics
p146
aVand did a fulsome investigation
p147
aVand found that two other,
p148
aVmuch older, different heights, different hairstyle,
p149
aVtwo other people committed the crime,
p150
aVnot these two boys.
p151
aa(lp152
VI actually went to court that day,
p153
aVfor what's called a "vacatur hearing,"
p154
aVwhere the conviction is thrown out.
p155
aVI went to court; I wanted to see
p156
aVMr. McCallum walk out of there.
p157
aVSo I went to court,
p158
aVand the judge said something that judges say all the time,
p159
aVbut this took on a really special meaning.
p160
aVHe looked up after the arguments and said,
p161
aV"Mr. McCallum,"
p162
aVhe said five beautiful words:
p163
aV"You are free to go."
p164
aVCan you imagine?
p165
aVAfter just about 30 years:
p166
aV"You are free to go."
p167
aVAnd he walked out of that courtroom.
p168
aa(lp169
VUnfortunately, his codefendant, Mr. Stuckey,
p170
aVdidn't get the benefit of that.
p171
aVYou see, Mr. Stuckey died in prison
p172
aVat 34 years old,
p173
aVand his mother sat at counsel table in his place.
p174
aVI'll never forget this the rest of my life.
p175
aVShe just rocked at the table, saying,
p176
aV"I knew my baby didn't do this.
p177
aVI knew my baby didn't do this."
p178
aVAnd her baby didn't do this.
p179
aVTwo other guys did it.
p180
aa(lp181
VIf there's anything that we've learned, anything that I've learned,
p182
aVwith this conviction integrity work,
p183
aVit's that justice doesn't happen.
p184
aVPeople make justice happen.
p185
aVJustice is not a thing that just descends from above
p186
aVand makes everything right.
p187
aVIf it did, Mr. Stuckey wouldn't have died in prison.
p188
aVJustice is something
p189
aVthat people of goodwill make happen.
p190
aVJustice is a decision.
p191
aVJustice is a decision.
p192
aVWe make justice happen.
p193
aa(lp194
VYou know, the scary thing is,
p195
aVin each of these three cases I described,
p196
aVit would have only taken just an extra minute \u2014
p197
aVan extra minute \u2014
p198
aVfor someone to look through the file
p199
aVand find this receipt.
p200
aVJust one \u2014 to look through the file, find the receipt,
p201
aVgive it to the public defender.
p202
aVIt would have taken someone just a minute
p203
aVto look at the video confession and say, "That cannot be."
p204
aVJust a minute.
p205
aVAnd perhaps Mr. Stuckey would be alive today.
p206
aa(lp207
VIt reminds me of one of my favorite poems.
p208
aVIt's a poem that Benjamin Elijah Mays would always recite,
p209
aVand he called it "God's Minute."
p210
aVAnd it goes something like this:
p211
aV"I have only just a minute,
p212
aVonly 60 seconds in it,
p213
aVforced upon me, can't refuse it,
p214
aVdidn't seek it, didn't choose it.
p215
aVBut it's up to me to use it.
p216
aVI must suffer if I lose it, give account if I abuse it.
p217
aVJust a tiny little minute,
p218
aVbut eternity is in it."
p219
aa(lp220
VIf I were to charge
p221
aVeach and every one of us,
p222
aVI would want to say something like,
p223
aV"Every day,
p224
aVevery day,
p225
aVtake just one extra minute
p226
aVand do some justice.
p227
aVYou don't have to \u2014
p228
aVI mean, some people spend their careers and their lives,
p229
aVlike public defenders,
p230
aVdoing justice every day.
p231
aVBut in your professional lives, whatever you do,
p232
aVtake time out
p233
aVto just
p234
aVdo some justice.
p235
aVMake a colleague feel better.
p236
aVIf you hear something that's sexist,
p237
aVdon't laugh, speak up.
p238
aVIf someone is down, lift them up,
p239
aVone extra minute each day,
p240
aVand it'll be a great, great place.
p241
aa(lp242
VI want to show you something.
p243
aVNow, above me is a picture
p244
aVof David McCallum.
p245
aVThis is the day he was released from prison.
p246
aVAfter 30 years, he got to hug a niece
p247
aVhe had never been able to touch before.
p248
aVAnd I asked him then,
p249
aVI said, "What's the first thing you want to do?"
p250
aVAnd he said, "I just want to walk on the sidewalk
p251
aVwithout anybody telling me where to go."
p252
aVWasn't bitter,
p253
aVjust wanted to walk on the sidewalk.
p254
aa(lp255
VI spoke to Mr. McCallum about two weeks ago.
p256
aVI went to New York.
p257
aVIt was on the two-year anniversary
p258
aVof his release.
p259
aVAnd we talked,
p260
aVwe laughed, we hugged, we cried.
p261
aVAnd he's doing quite well.
p262
aVAnd one of the things he said when we met with him
p263
aVis that he now has dedicated his life
p264
aVand his career
p265
aVto ensuring that nobody else is locked up unjustly.
p266
aa(lp267
VJustice, my friends,
p268
aVis a decision.
p269
aa(lp270
VThank you very much.
