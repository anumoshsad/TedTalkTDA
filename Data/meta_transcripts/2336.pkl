VWhen I was only three or four,
p4
aVI fell in love with poetry,
p5
aVwith the rhythms and the music of language;
p6
aVwith the power of metaphor and of imagery,
p7
aVpoetry being the essence of communication \u2014
p8
aVthe discipline, the distillation.
p9
aVAnd all these years later, the poems I'll read today
p10
aVare from my just-finished seventh book of poetry.
p11
aa(lp12
VWell, five years ago, I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.
p13
aVThough there's no cure yet,
p14
aVadvances in treatment are really impressive.
p15
aVBut you can imagine that I was appalled to learn
p16
aVthat women are largely left out of research trials,
p17
aVdespite gender-specific medical findings having demonstrated
p18
aVthat we are not actually just small men \u2014
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
Vwho happen to have different reproductive systems.
p23
aVGender-specific medicine is good for men, too.
p24
aa(lp25
VBut you bring to a crisis the person you already are,
p26
aVincluding the, yes, momentum that you've learned to invoke
p27
aVthrough passionate caring and through action,
p28
aVboth of which require but also create energy.
p29
aVSo as an activist, I began working with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation \u2014
p30
aVthat's pdf.org \u2014
p31
aVto create a major initiative to put women on the Parkinson's disease map.
p32
aVAnd as a poet, I began working with this subject matter,
p33
aVfinding it tragic, hilarious, sometimes even joyful.
p34
aVI do not feel diminished by Parkinson's;
p35
aVI feel distilled by it,
p36
aVand I actually very much like the woman I'm distilling into.
p37
aa(lp38
V"No Signs of Struggle"
p39
aa(lp40
VGrowing small requires enormity of will:
p41
aVjust sitting still in the doctor's waiting room
p42
aVwatching the future shuffle in and out,
p43
aVwatching it stoop; stare at you
p44
aVwhile you try not to look.
p45
aVRare is an exchange:
p46
aVa smile of brief, wry recognition.
p47
aa(lp48
VYou are the new kid on the block.
p49
aVEveryone here was you once.
p50
aVYou are still learning that growing small requires a largeness of spirit
p51
aVyou can't fit into yet:
p52
aVacceptance of irritating help from those who love you;
p53
aVgiving way and over, but not up.
p54
aa(lp55
VYou've swallowed hard the contents of the "Drink Me" bottle,
p56
aVand felt yourself shrink.
p57
aVNow, familiar furniture looms,
p58
aVfloors tilt, and doorknobs yield only when wrestled round with both hands.
p59
aVIt demands colossal patience, all this growing small:
p60
aVyour diminished sleep at night,
p61
aVyour handwriting, your voice, your height.
p62
aa(lp63
VYou are more the incredible shrinking woman
p64
aVthan the Buddhist mystic, serene, making do with less.
p65
aVLess is not always more.
p66
aVYet in this emptying space, space glimmers,
p67
aVbecoming visible.
p68
aVHere is a place behind the eyes of those accustomed
p69
aVby what some would call diminishment.
p70
aa(lp71
VIt is a place of merciless poetry,
p72
aVa gift of presence previously ignored,
p73
aVdrowned in the daily clutter.
p74
aVHere every gesture needs intention,
p75
aVis alive with consciousness.
p76
aVNothing is automatic.
p77
aa(lp78
VYou can spot it in the provocation of a button,
p79
aVan arm poking at a sleeve,
p80
aVa balancing act at a night-time curb while negotiating the dark.
p81
aVFeats of such modest valor,
p82
aVwho would suspect them to be exercises in an intimate, fierce discipline,
p83
aVa metaphysics of being relentlessly aware?
p84
aa(lp85
VSuch understated power here,
p86
aVin these tottering dancers who exert stupendous effort
p87
aVon tasks most view as insignificant.
p88
aVSuch quiet beauty here, in these,
p89
aVmy soft-voiced, stiff-limbed people;
p90
aVsuch resolve masked by each placid face.
p91
aVThere is immensity required in growing small,
p92
aVso bent on such unbending grace.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Applause)
p95
aa(lp96
VThank you.
p97
aa(lp98
VThis one is called "On Donating My Brain to Science."
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VNot a problem.
p103
aVSkip over all the pages reassuring religious people.
p104
aVAlready a universal donor: kidneys, corneas, liver, lungs,
p105
aVtissue, heart, veins, whatever.
p106
aa(lp107
VOdd that the modest brain never imagined its unique value in research,
p108
aVmaybe saving someone else from what it is they're not quite sure I have.
p109
aVFlattering, that.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo fill in the forms,
p112
aVdrill through the answers,
p113
aVtrill out a blithe spirit.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd slice me, dice me, spread me on your slides.
p116
aVFind what I'm trying to tell you.
p117
aa(lp118
VEarn me, learn me, scan me, squint through your lens.
p119
aVUncover what I'd hint at if I could.
p120
aa(lp121
VBe my guest, do your best, harvest me, track the clues.
p122
aVThis was a good brain while alive.
p123
aVThis was a brain that paid its dues.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo slice me, dice me, smear me on your slides,
p126
aVstain me, explain me, drain me like a cup.
p127
aVShare me, hear me:
p128
aa(lp129
VI want to be used I want to be used
p130
aVI want to be used up.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Applause)
p133
aa(lp134
V(Applause ends)
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd this one's called "The Ghost Light."
p137
aa(lp138
VLit from within is the sole secure way
p139
aVto traverse dark matter.
p140
aVSome life forms \u2014 certain mushrooms, snails, jellyfish, worms \u2014
p141
aVglow bioluminescent,
p142
aVand people as well;
p143
aVwe emit infra-red light from our most lucent selves.
p144
aVOur tragedy is we can't see it.
p145
aa(lp146
VWe see by reflecting.
p147
aVWe need biofluorescence to show our true colors.
p148
aVExternal illumination can distort, though.
p149
aVWhen gravity bends light,
p150
aVhuge galaxy clusters can act as telescopes,
p151
aVelongating background images of star systems to faint arcs \u2014
p152
aVa lensing effect
p153
aVlike viewing distant street lamps through a glass of wine.
p154
aa(lp155
VA glass of wine or two now makes me weave
p156
aVas if acting the drunkard's part;
p157
aVas if, besotted with unrequited love
p158
aVfor the dynamic Turner canvasses spied out by the Hubble,
p159
aVI could lurch down a city street set
p160
aVwithout provoking every pedestrian walk-on stare.
p161
aa(lp162
VStare as long as you need to.
p163
aVIf you think about it, walking, even standing, is illogical \u2014
p164
aVsuch tiny things, feet! \u2014
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
Vespecially when one's body is not al dente anymore.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VBesides, creature of extremes and excess,
p173
aVI've always thought Apollo beautiful but boring,
p174
aVand a bit of a dumb blonde.
p175
aVDionysians don't do balance.
p176
aa(lp177
VBalance, in other words, has never been my strong point.
p178
aVBut I digress.
p179
aVMore and more these days,
p180
aVdigression seems the most direct route through
p181
aVfrom where I've lost or found myself
p182
aVout of place, mind, turn, time.
p183
aa(lp184
VPlace your foot just so, mind how you turn:
p185
aVtoo swift a swivel can bring you down.
p186
aVTake your time ushering the audience out,
p187
aVsaying goodbye to the actors.
p188
aVThe ghost light
p189
aVis what they call the single bulb
p190
aVhanging above the bare stage in an empty theater.
p191
aa(lp192
VIn the empty theater of such a night,
p193
aVwaking to meet no external radiance,
p194
aVthis is the final struggle left to win,
p195
aVthis the sole beacon to beckon the darkness in
p196
aVand let the rest begin,
p197
aVthis the lens through which at last to see both Self and Other
p198
aVarrayed with the bright stain of original sin:
p199
aVlit from within.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Applause)
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd this is the last one.
p204
aa(lp205
V"This Dark Hour"
p206
aa(lp207
VLate summer, 4 A.M.
p208
aVThe rain slows to a stop,
p209
aVdripping still from the broad leaves
p210
aVof blue hostas unseen in the garden's dark.
p211
aVBarefoot, careful on the slick slate slabs,
p212
aVI need no light, I know the way,
p213
aVstoop by the mint bed,
p214
aVscoop a fistful of moist earth,
p215
aVthen grope for a chair,
p216
aVspread a shawl, and sit,
p217
aVbreathing in the wet green August air.
p218
aa(lp219
VThis is the small, still hour
p220
aVbefore the newspaper lands in the vestibule like a grenade,
p221
aVthe phone shrills, the computer screen blinks and glares awake.
p222
aa(lp223
VThere is this hour:
p224
aVpoem in my head, soil in my hand:
p225
aVunnamable fullness.
p226
aVThis hour, when blood of my blood
p227
aVbone of bone, child grown to manhood now \u2014
p228
aVstranger, intimate, not distant but apart \u2014
p229
aVlies safe, off dreaming melodies
p230
aVwhile love sleeps, safe, in his arms.
p231
aa(lp232
VTo have come to this place,
p233
aVlived to this moment:
p234
aVimmeasurable lightness.
p235
aVThe density of black starts to blur umber.
p236
aVTentative, a cardinal's coloratura,
p237
aVthen the mourning dove's elegy.
p238
aVSable glimmers toward grey;
p239
aVobjects emerge, trailing shadows;
p240
aVnight ages toward day.
p241
aVThe city stirs.
p242
aa(lp243
VThere will be other dawns, nights, gaudy noons.
p244
aVLikely, I'll lose my way.
p245
aVThere will be stumbling, falling,
p246
aVcursing the dark.
p247
aVWhatever comes,
p248
aVthere was this hour when nothing mattered,
p249
aVall was unbearably dear.
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd when I'm done with daylights,
p252
aVshould those who loved me grieve too long a while,
p253
aVlet them remember that I had this hour \u2014
p254
aVthis dark, perfect hour \u2014
p255
aVand smile.
p256
aa(lp257
VThank you.
