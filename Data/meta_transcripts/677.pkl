VI want to open by quoting Einstein's wonderful statement,
p4
aVjust so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20th century
p5
aValso agrees with us, and also calls us to this action.
p6
aVHe said, "A human being is a part of the whole, called by us, the 'universe,' \u2014
p7
aVa part limited in time and space.
p8
aVHe experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings,
p9
aVas something separated from the rest,
p10
aVa kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.
p11
aVThis delusion is a kind of prison for us,
p12
aVrestricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us.
p13
aVOur task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion,
p14
aVto embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty."
p15
aa(lp16
VThis insight of Einstein's is uncannily close to that of Buddhist psychology,
p17
aVwherein compassion \u2014 "karuna," it is called \u2014
p18
aVis defined as, "the sensitivity to another's suffering
p19
aVand the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering."
p20
aVIt pairs closely with love, which is the will for the other to be happy,
p21
aVwhich requires, of course, that one feels some happiness oneself
p22
aVand wishes to share it.
p23
aVThis is perfect in that it clearly opposes self-centeredness
p24
aVand selfishness to compassion, the concern for others,
p25
aVand, further, it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self-concern
p26
aVsuffer helplessly, while the compassionate are more free
p27
aVand, implicitly, more happy.
p28
aa(lp29
VThe Dalai Lama often states that compassion is his best friend.
p30
aVIt helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair.
p31
aVCompassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering
p32
aVas the most absolute, most terrible suffering anyone has ever had
p33
aVand broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others,
p34
aVeven of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings.
p35
aVIn fact, suffering is so huge and enormous,
p36
aVhis own becomes less and less monumental.
p37
aVAnd he begins to move beyond his self-concern into the broader concern for others.
p38
aVAnd this immediately cheers him up,
p39
aVas his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion.
p40
aVThus, he uses his own suffering
p41
aVas a doorway to widening his circle of compassion.
p42
aVHe is a very good colleague of Einstein's, we must say.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow, I want to tell a story,
p45
aVwhich is a very famous story in the Indian and Buddhist tradition,
p46
aVof the great Saint Asanga
p47
aVwho was a contemporary of Augustine in the West
p48
aVand was sort of like the Buddhist Augustine.
p49
aVAnd Asanga lived 800 years after the Buddha's time.
p50
aVAnd he was discontented with the state of people's practice
p51
aVof the Buddhist religion in India at that time.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd so he said, "I'm sick of all this. Nobody's really living the doctrine.
p54
aVThey're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment,
p55
aVbut they are acting selfish and pathetic.
p56
aVSo, Buddha's teaching has lost its momentum.
p57
aVI know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now,
p58
aVbut exists currently in a certain heaven" \u2014 that's Maitreya \u2014
p59
aV"so, I'm going to go on a retreat and I'm going to meditate
p60
aVand pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me,
p61
aVand gives me a teaching or something
p62
aVto revive the practice of compassion in the world today."
p63
aa(lp64
VSo he went on this retreat. And he meditated for three years
p65
aVand he did not see the future Buddha Maitreya.
p66
aVAnd he left in disgust.
p67
aVAnd as he was leaving, he saw a man \u2014
p68
aVa funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain.
p69
aVAnd he had a lump of iron.
p70
aVAnd he was rubbing it with a cloth.
p71
aVAnd he became interested in that.
p72
aVHe said, "Well what are you doing?"
p73
aVAnd the man said, "I'm making a needle."
p74
aVAnd he said, "That's ridiculous. You can't make a needle
p75
aVby rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth."
p76
aVAnd the man said, "Really?" And he showed him a dish full of needles.
p77
aVSo he said, "Okay, I get the point."
p78
aVHe went back to his cave. He meditated again.
p79
aa(lp80
VAnother three years, no vision. He leaves again.
p81
aVThis time, he comes down.
p82
aVAnd as he's leaving, he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge.
p83
aVAnd where it's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff,
p84
aVits feathers brushes the rock \u2014 and it had cut the rock
p85
aVsix to eight inches in. There was a cleft in the rock
p86
aVby the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds.
p87
aVSo he said, "All right. I get the point." He went back.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnother three years.
p90
aVAgain, no vision of Maitreya after nine years.
p91
aVAnd he again leaves, and this time: water dripping,
p92
aVmaking a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream.
p93
aVAnd so, again, he goes back. And after 12 years there is still no vision.
p94
aVAnd he's freaked out. And he won't even look left or right
p95
aVto see any encouraging vision.
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd he comes to the town. He's a broken person.
p98
aVAnd there, in the town, he's approached by a dog
p99
aVwho comes like this \u2014 one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries,
p100
aVeven in America, I think, in some areas \u2014
p101
aVand he's looking just terrible.
p102
aVAnd he becomes interested in this dog because it's so pathetic,
p103
aVand it's trying to attract his attention. And he sits down looking at the dog.
p104
aVAnd the dog's whole hindquarters are a complete open sore.
p105
aVSome of it is like gangrenous,
p106
aVand there are maggots in the flesh. And it's terrible.
p107
aVHe thinks, "What can I do to fix up this dog?
p108
aVWell, at least I can clean this wound and wash it."
p109
aa(lp110
VSo, he takes it to some water. He's about to clean,
p111
aVbut then his awareness focuses on the maggots.
p112
aVAnd he sees the maggots, and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute.
p113
aVAnd they're maggoting happily in the dog's hindquarters there.
p114
aV"Well, if I clean the dog, I'll kill the maggots. So how can that be?
p115
aVThat's it. I'm a useless person and there's no Buddha, no Maitreya,
p116
aVand everything is all hopeless.
p117
aVAnd now I'm going to kill the maggots?"
p118
aa(lp119
VSo, he had a brilliant idea.
p120
aVAnd he took a shard of something, and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh,
p121
aVand he placed it on ground.
p122
aVHe was not really thinking too carefully about the ASPCA.
p123
aVHe was just immediately caught with the situation.
p124
aVSo he thought, "I will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh,
p125
aVthen clean the dog's wounds, and then
p126
aVI'll figure out what to do with the maggots."
p127
aa(lp128
VSo he starts to do that. He can't grab the maggots.
p129
aVApparently they wriggle around. They're kind of hard to grab, these maggots.
p130
aVSo he says, "Well, I'll put my tongue on the dog's flesh.
p131
aVAnd then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue" \u2014
p132
aVthe dog is kind of used up \u2014
p133
aV"and then I'll spit them one by one down on the thing."
p134
aVSo he goes down, and he's sticking his tongue out like this.
p135
aVAnd he had to close his eyes, it's so disgusting, and the smell and everything.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd then, suddenly, there's a pfft, a noise like that.
p138
aVHe jumps back and there, of course, is the future Buddha Maitreya
p139
aVin a beautiful vision \u2014 rainbow lights, golden, jeweled, a plasma body,
p140
aVan exquisite mystic vision \u2014 that he sees.
p141
aVAnd he says, "Oh." He bows.
p142
aVBut, being human, he's immediately thinking of his next complaint.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo as he comes up from his first bow he says,
p145
aV"My Lord, I'm so happy to see you, but where have you been for 12 years?
p146
aVWhat is this?"
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd Maitreya says, "I was with you. Who do you think was making needles
p149
aVand making nests and dripping on rocks for you, mister dense?"
p150
aV(Laughter)
p151
aV"Looking for the Buddha in person," he said.
p152
aVAnd he said, "You didn't have, until this moment, real compassion.
p153
aVAnd, until you have real compassion, you cannot recognize love."
p154
aV"Maitreya" means love, "the loving one," in Sanskrit.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd so he looked very dubious, Asanga did.
p157
aVAnd he said, "If you don't believe me, just take me with you."
p158
aVAnd so he took the Maitreya \u2014 it shrunk into a globe, a ball \u2014
p159
aVtook him on his shoulder.
p160
aVAnd he ran into town in the marketplace, and he said, "Rejoice! Rejoice!
p161
aVThe future Buddha has come ahead of all predictions. Here he is."
p162
aVAnd then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him \u2014
p163
aVit wasn't Chautauqua, it was some other town \u2014
p164
aVbecause they saw a demented looking, scrawny looking yogi man,
p165
aVlike some kind of hippie, with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder,
p166
aVshouting that the future Buddha had come.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo, naturally, they chased him out of town.
p169
aVBut on the edge of town, one elderly lady, a charwoman in the charnel ground,
p170
aVsaw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog,
p171
aVbut she saw the jewel foot of the Maitreya, and she offered a flower.
p172
aVSo that encouraged him, and he went with Maitreya.
p173
aa(lp174
VMaitreya then took him to a certain heaven,
p175
aVwhich is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds.
p176
aVAnd Maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years,
p177
aVdictating to him five complicated tomes
p178
aVof the methodology of how you cultivate compassion.
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd then I thought I would share with you what that method is, or one of them.
p181
aVA famous one, it's called the "Sevenfold Causal Method of Developing Compassion."
p182
aVAnd it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one \u2014
p183
aVeven animals too, but everyone is in human form.
p184
aVThe animals are in one of their human lives. The humans are human.
p185
aVAnd then, among them, you think of your friends and loved ones, the circle at the table.
p186
aVAnd you think of your enemies, and you think of the neutral ones.
p187
aVAnd then you try to say, "Well, the loved ones I love.
p188
aVBut, you know, after all, they're nice to me.
p189
aVI had fights with them. Sometimes they were unfriendly.
p190
aVI got mad. Brothers can fight. Parents and children can fight.
p191
aVSo, in a way, I like them so much because they're nice to me.
p192
aVWhile the neutral ones I don't know. They could all be just fine.
p193
aVAnd then the enemies I don't like because they're mean to me.
p194
aVBut they are nice to somebody. I could be them."
p195
aa(lp196
VAnd then the Buddhists, of course, think that, because we've all had infinite previous lives,
p197
aVwe've all been each other's relatives, actually.
p198
aVTherefore all of you, in the Buddhist view,
p199
aVin some previous life, although you don't remember it and neither do I,
p200
aVhave been my mother \u2014 for which I do apologize for the trouble I caused you.
p201
aVAnd also, actually, I've been your mother.
p202
aVI've been female, and I've been every single one of yours' mother in a previous life,
p203
aVthe way the Buddhists reflect.
p204
aVSo, my mother in this life is really great. But all of you in a way
p205
aVare part of the eternal mother.
p206
aVYou gave me that expression; "the eternal mama," you said. That's wonderful.
p207
aVSo, that's the way the Buddhists do it.
p208
aVA theist Christian can think that all beings, even my enemies, are God's children.
p209
aVSo, in that sense, we're related.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo, they first create this foundation of equality.
p212
aVSo, we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love \u2014
p213
aVjust in the meditation \u2014 and we open our mind to those we don't know.
p214
aVAnd we definitely reduce the hostility and the "I don't want to be compassionate to them"
p215
aVto the ones we think of as the bad guys, the ones we hate and we don't like.
p216
aVAnd we don't hate anyone, therefore. So we equalize. That's very important.
p217
aa(lp218
VAnd then the next thing we do is what is called "mother recognition."
p219
aVAnd that is, we think of every being as familiar, as family.
p220
aVWe expand. We take the feeling about remembering a mama,
p221
aVand we defuse that to all beings in this meditation.
p222
aVAnd we see the mother in every being.
p223
aVWe see that look that the mother has on her face,
p224
aVlooking at this child that is a miracle
p225
aVthat she has produced from her own body, being a mammal,
p226
aVwhere she has true compassion, truly is the other, and identifies completely.
p227
aVOften the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life.
p228
aVAnd that's why it's the most powerful form of altruism.
p229
aVThe mother is the model of all altruism for human beings,
p230
aVin spiritual traditions.
p231
aVAnd so, we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings.
p232
aa(lp233
VPeople laugh at me because, you know, I used to say that
p234
aVI used to meditate on mama Cheney as my mom,
p235
aVwhen, of course, I was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in Iraq.
p236
aVI used to meditate on George Bush. He's quite a cute mom in a female form.
p237
aVHe has his little ears and he smiles and he rocks you in his arms.
p238
aVAnd you think of him as nursing you.
p239
aVAnd then Saddam Hussein's serious mustache is a problem,
p240
aVbut you think of him as a mom.
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd this is the way you do it. You take any being who looks weird to you,
p243
aVand you see how they could be familiar to you.
p244
aVAnd you do that for a while, until you really feel that.
p245
aVYou can feel the familiarity of all beings.
p246
aVNobody seems alien. They're not "other."
p247
aVYou reduce the feeling of otherness about beings.
p248
aVThen you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general,
p249
aVif you can remember the kindness of your own mother,
p250
aVif you can remember the kindness of your spouse,
p251
aVor, if you are a mother yourself, how you were with your children.
p252
aVAnd you begin to get very sentimental; you cultivate sentimentality intensely.
p253
aVYou will even weep, perhaps, with gratitude and kindness.
p254
aVAnd then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility.
p255
aVEvery being, even the most mean looking ones, can be motherly.
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd then, third, you step from there to what is called "a feeling of gratitude."
p258
aVYou want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you.
p259
aVAnd then the fourth step, you go to what is called "lovely love."
p260
aVIn each one of these you can take some weeks, or months, or days
p261
aVdepending on how you do it, or you can do them in a run, this meditation.
p262
aVAnd then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy,
p263
aVwhen they are satisfied.
p264
aVAnd every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness.
p265
aVTheir face doesn't look like this. When they're angry, they look ugly, every being,
p266
aVbut when they're happy they look beautiful.
p267
aVAnd so you see beings in their potential happiness.
p268
aVAnd you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy, even the enemy.
p269
aa(lp270
VWe think Jesus is being unrealistic
p271
aVwhen he says, "Love thine enemy."
p272
aVHe does say that, and we think he's being unrealistic
p273
aVand sort of spiritual and highfalutin. "Nice for him to say it, but I can't do that."
p274
aVBut, actually, that's practical.
p275
aVIf you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy.
p276
aVIf your enemy was really happy, why would they bother to be your enemy?
p277
aVHow boring to run around chasing you.
p278
aVThey would be relaxing somewhere having a good time.
p279
aVSo it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy,
p280
aVbecause they'll stop being your enemy because that's too much trouble.
p281
aa(lp282
VBut anyway, that's the "lovely love. "
p283
aVAnd then finally, the fifth step is compassion, "universal compassion."
p284
aVAnd that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of.
p285
aVAnd you look at them, and you see how they are.
p286
aVAnd you realize how unhappy they are actually, mostly, most of the time.
p287
aVYou see that furrowed brow in people.
p288
aVAnd then you realize they don't even have compassion on themselves.
p289
aVThey're driven by this duty and this obligation.
p290
aV"I have to get that. I need more. I'm not worthy. And I should do something."
p291
aVAnd they're rushing around all stressed out.
p292
aVAnd they think of it as somehow macho, hard discipline on themselves.
p293
aVBut actually they are cruel to themselves.
p294
aVAnd, of course, they are cruel and ruthless toward others.
p295
aVAnd they, then, never get any positive feedback.
p296
aVAnd the more they succeed and the more power they have,
p297
aVthe more unhappy they are.
p298
aVAnd this is where you feel real compassion for them.
p299
aa(lp300
VAnd you then feel you must act.
p301
aVAnd the choice of the action, of course,
p302
aVhopefully will be more practical
p303
aVthan poor Asanga, who was fixing the maggots on the dog
p304
aVbecause he had that motivation, and whoever was in front of him,
p305
aVhe wanted to help.
p306
aVBut, of course, that is impractical. He should have founded the ASPCA in the town
p307
aVand gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots.
p308
aVAnd I'm sure he did that later. (Laughter) But that just indicates the state of mind, you know.
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd so the next step \u2014 the sixth step beyond "universal compassion" \u2014
p311
aVis this thing where you're linked with the needs of others in a true way,
p312
aVand you have compassion for yourself also,
p313
aVand it isn't sentimental only. You might be in fear of something.
p314
aVSome bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy
p315
aVbeing more and more mean to other people
p316
aVand getting punished in the future for it in various ways.
p317
aVAnd in Buddhism, they catch it in the future life.
p318
aVOf course in theistic religion they're punished by God or whatever.
p319
aVAnd materialism, they think they get out of it just by not existing,
p320
aVby dying, but they don't.
p321
aVAnd so they get reborn as whatever, you know.
p322
aa(lp323
VNever mind. I won't get into that.
p324
aVBut the next step is called "universal responsibility."
p325
aVAnd that is very important \u2014 the Charter of Compassion
p326
aVmust lead us to develop through true compassion,
p327
aVwhat is called "universal responsibility."
p328
aVIn the great teaching of his Holiness the Dalai Lama
p329
aVthat he always teaches everywhere, he says
p330
aVthat that is the common religion of humanity: kindness.
p331
aVBut "kindness" means "universal responsibility."
p332
aVAnd that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us:
p333
aVwe are responsible for that, and we should take it
p334
aVand do whatever we can at whatever little level
p335
aVand small level that we can do it.
p336
aVWe absolutely must do that. There is no way not to do it.
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd then, finally, that leads to a new orientation in life
p339
aVwhere we live equally for ourselves and for others
p340
aVand we are
p341
aVjoyful and happy.
p342
aVOne thing we mustn't think is that compassion makes you miserable.
p343
aVCompassion makes you happy.
p344
aVThe first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself,
p345
aVeven if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else.
p346
aVAlthough, the change in your mind already does something for other beings:
p347
aVthey can sense this new quality in yourself,
p348
aVand it helps them already, and gives them an example.
p349
aa(lp350
VAnd that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it's all over.
p351
aa(lp352
VSo, practice compassion, read the charter, disseminate it
p353
aVand develop it within yourself.
p354
aVDon't just think, "Well, I'm compassionate," or "I'm not compassionate,"
p355
aVand sort of think you're stuck there.
p356
aVYou can develop this. You can diminish the non-compassion,
p357
aVthe cruelty, the callousness, the neglect of others,
p358
aVand take universal responsibility for them.
p359
aVAnd then, not only will God smile and the eternal mama will smile,
p360
aVbut Karen Armstrong will smile.
p361
aa(lp362
VThank you very much. (Applause)
