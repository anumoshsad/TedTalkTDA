VAs the highest military commander of the Netherlands,
p4
aVwith troops stationed around the world,
p5
aVI'm really honored to be here today.
p6
aa(lp7
VWhen I look around this TEDxAmsterdam venue,
p8
aVI see a very special audience.
p9
aVYou are the reason why I said yes
p10
aVto the invitation to come here today.
p11
aVWhen I look around, I see people who want to make a contribution.
p12
aVI see people who want to make a better world,
p13
aVby doing groundbreaking scientific work,
p14
aVby creating impressive works of art,
p15
aVby writing critical articles or inspiring books,
p16
aVby starting up sustainable businesses.
p17
aVAnd you all have chosen your own instruments
p18
aVto fulfill this mission of creating a better world.
p19
aVSome chose the microscope as their instrument.
p20
aVOthers chose dancing or painting,
p21
aVor making music like we just heard.
p22
aVSome chose the pen.
p23
aVOthers work through the instrument of money.
p24
aa(lp25
VLadies and gentlemen, I made a different choice.
p26
aa(lp27
VThanks.
p28
aa(lp29
VLadies and gentlemen ...
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
V(Applause)
p34
aa(lp35
VI share your goals.
p36
aVI share the goals of the speakers you heard before.
p37
aVI did not choose to take up the pen,
p38
aVthe brush,
p39
aVthe camera.
p40
aVI chose this instrument.
p41
aVI chose the gun.
p42
aa(lp43
VFor you, and you heard already,
p44
aVbeing so close to this gun may make you feel uneasy.
p45
aVIt may even feel scary.
p46
aVA real gun at a few feet's distance.
p47
aVLet us stop for a moment and feel this uneasiness.
p48
aVYou could even hear it.
p49
aVLet us cherish the fact
p50
aVthat probably most of you have never been close to a gun.
p51
aVIt means the Netherlands is a peaceful country.
p52
aVThe Netherlands is not at war.
p53
aVIt means soldiers are not needed to patrol our streets.
p54
aVGuns are not a part of our lives.
p55
aVIn many countries, it is a different story.
p56
aVIn many countries, people are confronted with guns.
p57
aVThey are oppressed.
p58
aVThey are intimidated \u2014
p59
aVby warlords,
p60
aVby terrorists,
p61
aVby criminals.
p62
aVWeapons can do a lot of harm.
p63
aVThey are the cause of much distress.
p64
aa(lp65
VWhy then am I standing before you with this weapon?
p66
aVWhy did I choose the gun as my instrument?
p67
aVToday I want to tell you why.
p68
aVToday I want to tell you
p69
aVwhy I chose the gun to create a better world.
p70
aVAnd I want to tell you how this gun can help.
p71
aa(lp72
VMy story starts in the city of Nijmegen
p73
aVin the east of the Netherlands,
p74
aVthe city where I was born.
p75
aVMy father was a hardworking baker,
p76
aVbut when he had finished work in the bakery,
p77
aVhe often told me and my brother stories.
p78
aVAnd most of the time,
p79
aVhe told me this story I'm going to share with you now.
p80
aVThe story of what happened
p81
aVwhen he was a conscripted soldier in the Dutch armed forces
p82
aVat the beginning of the Second World War.
p83
aVThe Nazis invaded the Netherlands.
p84
aVTheir grim plans were evident.
p85
aVThey meant to rule by means of repression.
p86
aVDiplomacy had failed to stop the Germans.
p87
aVOnly brute force remained.
p88
aVIt was our last resort.
p89
aVMy father was there to provide it.
p90
aa(lp91
VAs the son of a farmer who knew how to hunt,
p92
aVmy father was an excellent marksman.
p93
aVWhen he aimed, he never missed.
p94
aVAt this decisive moment in Dutch history
p95
aVmy father was positioned on the bank of the river Waal
p96
aVnear the city of Nijmegen.
p97
aVHe had a clear shot at the German soldiers who came to occupy a free country,
p98
aVhis country,
p99
aVour country.
p100
aVHe fired. Nothing happened.
p101
aVHe fired again.
p102
aVNo German soldier fell to the ground.
p103
aVMy father had been given an old gun
p104
aVthat could not even reach the opposite riverbank.
p105
aVHitler's troops marched on,
p106
aVand there was nothing my father could do about it.
p107
aa(lp108
VUntil the day my father died,
p109
aVhe was frustrated about missing these shots.
p110
aVHe could have done something.
p111
aVBut with an old gun,
p112
aVnot even the best marksman in the armed forces
p113
aVcould have hit the mark.
p114
aVSo this story stayed with me.
p115
aa(lp116
VThen in high school,
p117
aVI was gripped by the stories of the Allied soldiers \u2014
p118
aVsoldiers who left the safety of their own homes and risked their lives
p119
aVto liberate a country
p120
aVand a people that they didn't know.
p121
aVThey liberated my birth town.
p122
aVIt was then that I decided I would take up the gun \u2014
p123
aVout of respect and gratitude for those men and women
p124
aVwho came to liberate us.
p125
aVFrom the awareness that sometimes only the gun
p126
aVcan stand between good and evil.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd that is why I took up the gun \u2014
p129
aVnot to shoot,
p130
aVnot to kill,
p131
aVnot to destroy,
p132
aVbut to stop those who would do evil,
p133
aVto protect the vulnerable,
p134
aVto defend democratic values,
p135
aVto stand up for the freedom we have to talk here today in Amsterdam
p136
aVabout how we can make the world a better place.
p137
aa(lp138
VLadies and gentlemen,
p139
aVI do not stand here today to tell you about the glory of weapons.
p140
aVI do not like guns.
p141
aVAnd once you have been under fire yourself,
p142
aVit brings home even more clearly
p143
aVthat a gun is not some macho instrument to brag about.
p144
aVI stand here today
p145
aVto tell you about the use of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability.
p146
aVThe gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability
p147
aVthat we have in this world.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow this may sound contradictory to you.
p150
aVBut not only have I seen with my own eyes
p151
aVduring my deployments in Lebanon, Sarajevo
p152
aVand as the Netherlands' Chief of Defence,
p153
aVthis is also supported by cold, hard statistics.
p154
aVViolence has declined dramatically over the last 500 years.
p155
aVDespite the pictures we are shown daily in the news,
p156
aVwars between developed countries are no longer commonplace.
p157
aVThe murder rate in Europe
p158
aVhas dropped by a factor of 30 since the Middle Ages.
p159
aVAnd occurrences of civil war and repression
p160
aVhave declined since the end of the Cold War.
p161
aVStatistics show that we are living in a relatively peaceful era.
p162
aa(lp163
VWhy?
p164
aVWhy has violence decreased?
p165
aVHas the human mind changed?
p166
aVWell, we were talking about the human mind this morning.
p167
aVDid we simply lose our beastly impulses for revenge,
p168
aVfor violent rituals,
p169
aVfor pure rage?
p170
aVOr is there something else?
p171
aVIn his latest book, Harvard professor Steven Pinker \u2014
p172
aVand many other thinkers before him \u2014
p173
aVconcludes that one of the main drivers
p174
aVbehind less violent societies
p175
aVis the spread of the constitutional state
p176
aVand the introduction, on a large scale,
p177
aVof the state monopoly on the legitimized use of violence \u2014
p178
aVlegitimized by a democratically elected government,
p179
aVlegitimized by checks and balances and an independent judicial system.
p180
aVIn other words, a state monopoly
p181
aVthat has the use of violence well under control.
p182
aa(lp183
VSuch a state monopoly on violence, first of all, serves as a reassurance.
p184
aVIt removes the incentive for an arms race
p185
aVbetween potentially hostile groups in our societies.
p186
aVSecondly, the presence of penalties
p187
aVthat outweigh the benefits of using violence
p188
aVtips the balance even further.
p189
aVAbstaining from violence
p190
aVbecomes more profitable than starting a war.
p191
aVNow nonviolence starts to work like a flywheel.
p192
aVIt enhances peace even further.
p193
aVWhere there is no conflict, trade flourishes.
p194
aVAnd trade is another important incentive against violence.
p195
aVWith trade, there's mutual interdependency and mutual gain between parties.
p196
aVAnd when there is mutual gain, both sides stand to lose more
p197
aVthan they would gain if they started a war.
p198
aVWar is simply no longer the best option,
p199
aVand that is why violence has decreased.
p200
aa(lp201
VThis, ladies and gentlemen,
p202
aVis the rationale behind the existence of my armed forces.
p203
aVThe armed forces implement the state monopoly on violence.
p204
aVWe do this in a legitimized way
p205
aVonly after our democracy has asked us to do so.
p206
aVIt is this legitimate, controlled use of the gun
p207
aVthat has contributed greatly
p208
aVto reducing the statistics of war, conflict and violence around the globe.
p209
aVIt is this participation in peacekeeping missions
p210
aVthat has led to the resolution of many civil wars.
p211
aVMy soldiers use the gun as an instrument of peace.
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd this is exactly why failed states are so dangerous.
p214
aVFailed states have no legitimized, democratically controlled use of force.
p215
aVFailed states do not know of the gun as an instrument of peace and stability.
p216
aVThat is why failed states can drag down a whole region into chaos and conflict.
p217
aVThat is why spreading the concept of the constitutional state
p218
aVis such an important aspect of our foreign missions.
p219
aVThat is why we are trying to build a judicial system
p220
aVright now in Afghanistan.
p221
aVThat is why we train police officers, we train judges,
p222
aVwe train public prosecutors around the world.
p223
aVAnd that is why \u2014
p224
aVand in the Netherlands, we are very unique in that \u2014
p225
aVthat is why the Dutch constitution states
p226
aVthat one of the main tasks of the armed forces
p227
aVis to uphold and promote the international rule of law.
p228
aa(lp229
VLadies and gentlemen,
p230
aVlooking at this gun, we are confronted with the ugly side of the human mind.
p231
aVEvery day I hope that politicians, diplomats, development workers
p232
aVcan turn conflict into peace
p233
aVand threat
p234
aVinto hope.
p235
aVAnd I hope that one day armies can be disbanded
p236
aVand humans will find a way of living together
p237
aVwithout violence and oppression.
p238
aVBut until that day comes,
p239
aVwe will have to make ideals and human failure
p240
aVmeet somewhere in the middle.
p241
aVUntil that day comes, I stand for my father
p242
aVwho tried to shoot the Nazis with an old gun.
p243
aVI stand for my men and women who are prepared to risk their lives
p244
aVfor a less violent world for all of us.
p245
aVI stand for this soldier who suffered partial hearing loss
p246
aVand sustained permanent injuries to her leg,
p247
aVwhen she was hit by a rocket on a mission in Afghanistan.
p248
aa(lp249
VLadies and gentlemen,
p250
aVuntil the day comes when we can do away with the gun,
p251
aVI hope we all agree
p252
aVthat peace and stability do not come free of charge.
p253
aVIt takes hard work, often behind the scenes.
p254
aVIt takes good equipment and well-trained, dedicated soldiers.
p255
aVI hope you will support the efforts of our armed forces
p256
aVto train soldiers like this young captain
p257
aVand provide her with a good gun,
p258
aVinstead of the bad gun my father was given.
p259
aVI hope you will support our soldiers when they are out there,
p260
aVwhen they come home
p261
aVand when they are injured and need our care.
p262
aVThey put their lives on the line, for us, for you,
p263
aVand we cannot let them down.
p264
aa(lp265
VI hope you will respect my soldiers,
p266
aVthis soldier with this gun.
p267
aVBecause she wants a better world.
p268
aVBecause she makes an active contribution to a better world,
p269
aVjust like all of us here today.
p270
aa(lp271
