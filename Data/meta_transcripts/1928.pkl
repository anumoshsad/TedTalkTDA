VI'd like to talk today
p4
aVabout a powerful and fundamental aspect
p5
aVof who we are: our voice.
p6
aVEach one of us has a unique voiceprint
p7
aVthat reflects our age, our size,
p8
aVeven our lifestyle and personality.
p9
aVIn the words of the poet Longfellow,
p10
aV"the human voice is the organ of the soul."
p11
aVAs a speech scientist, I'm fascinated
p12
aVby how the voice is produced,
p13
aVand I have an idea for how it can be engineered.
p14
aVThat's what I'd like to share with you.
p15
aa(lp16
VI'm going to start by playing you a sample
p17
aVof a voice that you may recognize.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Recording) Stephen Hawking: "I would have thought
p20
aVit was fairly obvious what I meant."
p21
aa(lp22
VRupal Patel: That was the voice
p23
aVof Professor Stephen Hawking.
p24
aVWhat you may not know is that same voice
p25
aVmay also be used by this little girl
p26
aVwho is unable to speak
p27
aVbecause of a neurological condition.
p28
aVIn fact, all of these individuals
p29
aVmay be using the same voice,
p30
aVand that's because there's only a few options available.
p31
aVIn the U.S. alone, there are 2.5 million Americans
p32
aVwho are unable to speak,
p33
aVand many of whom use computerized devices
p34
aVto communicate.
p35
aVNow that's millions of people worldwide
p36
aVwho are using generic voices,
p37
aVincluding Professor Hawking,
p38
aVwho uses an American-accented voice.
p39
aVThis lack of individuation of the synthetic voice
p40
aVreally hit home
p41
aVwhen I was at an assistive technology conference
p42
aVa few years ago,
p43
aVand I recall walking into an exhibit hall
p44
aVand seeing a little girl and a grown man
p45
aVhaving a conversation using their devices,
p46
aVdifferent devices, but the same voice.
p47
aVAnd I looked around and I saw this happening
p48
aVall around me, literally hundreds of individuals
p49
aVusing a handful of voices,
p50
aVvoices that didn't fit their bodies
p51
aVor their personalities.
p52
aVWe wouldn't dream of fitting a little girl
p53
aVwith the prosthetic limb of a grown man.
p54
aVSo why then the same prosthetic voice?
p55
aVIt really struck me,
p56
aVand I wanted to do something about this.
p57
aa(lp58
VI'm going to play you now a sample
p59
aVof someone who has, two people actually,
p60
aVwho have severe speech disorders.
p61
aVI want you to take a listen to how they sound.
p62
aVThey're saying the same utterance.
p63
aa(lp64
V(First voice)
p65
aa(lp66
V(Second voice)
p67
aVYou probably didn't understand what they said,
p68
aVbut I hope that you heard
p69
aVtheir unique vocal identities.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo what I wanted to do next is,
p72
aVI wanted to find out how we could harness
p73
aVthese residual vocal abilities
p74
aVand build a technology
p75
aVthat could be customized for them,
p76
aVvoices that could be customized for them.
p77
aVSo I reached out to my collaborator, Tim Bunnell.
p78
aVDr. Bunnell is an expert in speech synthesis,
p79
aVand what he'd been doing is building
p80
aVpersonalized voices for people
p81
aVby putting together
p82
aVpre-recorded samples of their voice
p83
aVand reconstructing a voice for them.
p84
aVThese are people who had lost their voice
p85
aVlater in life.
p86
aVWe didn't have the luxury
p87
aVof pre-recorded samples of speech
p88
aVfor those born with speech disorder.
p89
aVBut I thought, there had to be a way
p90
aVto reverse engineer a voice
p91
aVfrom whatever little is left over.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo we decided to do exactly that.
p94
aVWe set out with a little bit of funding from the National Science Foundation,
p95
aVto create custom-crafted voices that captured
p96
aVtheir unique vocal identities.
p97
aVWe call this project VocaliD, or vocal I.D.,
p98
aVfor vocal identity.
p99
aa(lp100
VNow before I get into the details of how
p101
aVthe voice is made and let you listen to it,
p102
aVI need to give you a real quick speech science lesson. Okay?
p103
aVSo first, we know that the voice is changing
p104
aVdramatically over the course of development.
p105
aVChildren sound different from teens
p106
aVwho sound different from adults.
p107
aVWe've all experienced this.
p108
aVFact number two is that speech
p109
aVis a combination of the source,
p110
aVwhich is the vibrations generated by your voice box,
p111
aVwhich are then pushed through
p112
aVthe rest of the vocal tract.
p113
aVThese are the chambers of your head and neck
p114
aVthat vibrate,
p115
aVand they actually filter that source sound
p116
aVto produce consonants and vowels.
p117
aVSo the combination of source and filter
p118
aVis how we produce speech.
p119
aVAnd that happens in one individual.
p120
aa(lp121
VNow I told you earlier that I'd spent
p122
aVa good part of my career
p123
aVunderstanding and studying
p124
aVthe source characteristics of people
p125
aVwith severe speech disorder,
p126
aVand what I've found
p127
aVis that even though their filters were impaired,
p128
aVthey were able to modulate their source:
p129
aVthe pitch, the loudness, the tempo of their voice.
p130
aVThese are called prosody, and I've been documenting for years
p131
aVthat the prosodic abilities of these individuals
p132
aVare preserved.
p133
aVSo when I realized that those same cues
p134
aVare also important for speaker identity,
p135
aVI had this idea.
p136
aVWhy don't we take the source
p137
aVfrom the person we want the voice to sound like,
p138
aVbecause it's preserved,
p139
aVand borrow the filter
p140
aVfrom someone about the same age and size,
p141
aVbecause they can articulate speech,
p142
aVand then mix them?
p143
aVBecause when we mix them,
p144
aVwe can get a voice that's as clear
p145
aVas our surrogate talker \u2014
p146
aVthat's the person we borrowed the filter from\u2014
p147
aVand is similar in identity to our target talker.
p148
aVIt's that simple.
p149
aVThat's the science behind what we're doing.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo once you have that in mind,
p152
aVhow do you go about building this voice?
p153
aVWell, you have to find someone
p154
aVwho is willing to be a surrogate.
p155
aVIt's not such an ominous thing.
p156
aVBeing a surrogate donor
p157
aVonly requires you to say a few hundred
p158
aVto a few thousand utterances.
p159
aVThe process goes something like this.
p160
aa(lp161
V(Video) Voice: Things happen in pairs.
p162
aa(lp163
VI love to sleep.
p164
aa(lp165
VThe sky is blue without clouds.
p166
aa(lp167
VRP: Now she's going to go on like this
p168
aVfor about three to four hours,
p169
aVand the idea is not for her to say everything
p170
aVthat the target is going to want to say,
p171
aVbut the idea is to cover all the different combinations
p172
aVof the sounds that occur in the language.
p173
aVThe more speech you have,
p174
aVthe better sounding voice you're going to have.
p175
aVOnce you have those recordings,
p176
aVwhat we need to do
p177
aVis we have to parse these recordings
p178
aVinto little snippets of speech,
p179
aVone- or two-sound combinations,
p180
aVsometimes even whole words
p181
aVthat start populating a dataset or a database.
p182
aVWe're going to call this database a voice bank.
p183
aVNow the power of the voice bank
p184
aVis that from this voice bank,
p185
aVwe can now say any new utterance,
p186
aVlike, "I love chocolate" \u2014
p187
aVeveryone needs to be able to say that\u2014
p188
aVfish through that database
p189
aVand find all the segments necessary
p190
aVto say that utterance.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Video) Voice: I love chocolate.
p193
aa(lp194
VRP: So that's speech synthesis.
p195
aVIt's called concatenative synthesis, and that's what we're using.
p196
aVThat's not the novel part.
p197
aVWhat's novel is how we make it sound
p198
aVlike this young woman.
p199
aa(lp200
VThis is Samantha.
p201
aVI met her when she was nine,
p202
aVand since then, my team and I
p203
aVhave been trying to build her a personalized voice.
p204
aVWe first had to find a surrogate donor,
p205
aVand then we had to have Samantha
p206
aVproduce some utterances.
p207
aVWhat she can produce are mostly vowel-like sounds,
p208
aVbut that's enough for us to extract
p209
aVher source characteristics.
p210
aVWhat happens next is best described
p211
aVby my daughter's analogy. She's six.
p212
aVShe calls it mixing colors to paint voices.
p213
aVIt's beautiful. It's exactly that.
p214
aVSamantha's voice is like a concentrated sample
p215
aVof red food dye which we can infuse
p216
aVinto the recordings of her surrogate
p217
aVto get a pink voice just like this.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Video) Samantha: Aaaaaah.
p220
aa(lp221
VRP: So now, Samantha can say this.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Video) Samantha: This voice is only for me.
p224
aVI can't wait to use my new voice with my friends.
p225
aa(lp226
VRP: Thank you. (Applause)
p227
aa(lp228
VI'll never forget the gentle smile
p229
aVthat spread across her face
p230
aVwhen she heard that voice for the first time.
p231
aVNow there's millions of people
p232
aVaround the world like Samantha, millions,
p233
aVand we've only begun to scratch the surface.
p234
aVWhat we've done so far is we have
p235
aVa few surrogate talkers from around the U.S.
p236
aVwho have donated their voices,
p237
aVand we have been using those
p238
aVto build our first few personalized voices.
p239
aVBut there's so much more work to be done.
p240
aVFor Samantha, her surrogate
p241
aVcame from somewhere in the Midwest, a stranger
p242
aVwho gave her the gift of voice.
p243
aVAnd as a scientist, I'm so excited
p244
aVto take this work out of the laboratory
p245
aVand finally into the real world
p246
aVso it can have real-world impact.
p247
aVWhat I want to share with you next
p248
aVis how I envision taking this work
p249
aVto that next level.
p250
aVI imagine a whole world of surrogate donors
p251
aVfrom all walks of life, different sizes, different ages,
p252
aVcoming together in this voice drive
p253
aVto give people voices
p254
aVthat are as colorful as their personalities.
p255
aVTo do that as a first step,
p256
aVwe've put together this website, VocaliD.org,
p257
aVas a way to bring together those
p258
aVwho want to join us as voice donors,
p259
aVas expertise donors,
p260
aVin whatever way to make this vision a reality.
p261
aa(lp262
VThey say that giving blood can save lives.
p263
aVWell, giving your voice can change lives.
p264
aVAll we need is a few hours of speech
p265
aVfrom our surrogate talker,
p266
aVand as little as a vowel from our target talker,
p267
aVto create a unique vocal identity.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo that's the science behind what we're doing.
p270
aVI want to end by circling back to the human side
p271
aVthat is really the inspiration for this work.
p272
aVAbout five years ago, we built our very first voice
p273
aVfor a little boy named William.
p274
aVWhen his mom first heard this voice,
p275
aVshe said, "This is what William
p276
aVwould have sounded like
p277
aVhad he been able to speak."
p278
aVAnd then I saw William typing a message
p279
aVon his device.
p280
aVI wondered, what was he thinking?
p281
aVImagine carrying around someone else's voice
p282
aVfor nine years
p283
aVand finally finding your own voice.
p284
aVImagine that.
p285
aa(lp286
VThis is what William said:
p287
aV"Never heard me before."
p288
aa(lp289
VThank you.
