VWhat I wanted to talk to you about today is two things:
p4
aVone, the rise of a culture of availability;
p5
aVand two, a request.
p6
aVSo we're seeing a rise of this availability
p7
aVbeing driven by mobile device proliferation,
p8
aVglobally, across all social strata.
p9
aVWe're seeing, along with that proliferation of mobile devices,
p10
aVan expectation of availability.
p11
aVAnd, with that, comes the third point,
p12
aVwhich is obligation \u2014 and an obligation to that availability.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd the problem is, we're still working through,
p15
aVfrom a societal standpoint,
p16
aVhow we allow people to be available.
p17
aVThere's a significant delta, in fact,
p18
aVbetween what we're willing to accept.
p19
aVApologies to Hans Rosling \u2014
p20
aVhe said anything that's not using real stats is a lie \u2014
p21
aVbut the big delta there
p22
aVis how we deal with this from a public standpoint.
p23
aVSo we've developed certain tactics and strategies
p24
aVto cover up.
p25
aa(lp26
VThis first one's called "the lean."
p27
aVAnd if you've ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting "chicken,"
p28
aVyou're sitting there, looking at the person, waiting for them to look away,
p29
aVand then quickly checking the device.
p30
aVAlthough you can see the gentleman up on the right is busting him.
p31
aa(lp32
V"The stretch."
p33
aVOK, the gentleman on the left is saying, "Screw you,
p34
aVI'm going to check my device."
p35
aVBut the guy, here, on the right,
p36
aVhe's doing the stretch.
p37
aVIt's that reeeee-e-e-each out, the physical contortion
p38
aVto get that device just below the tabletop.
p39
aa(lp40
VOr, my favorite, the "Love you; mean it."
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aVNothing says "I love you"
p43
aVlike "Let me find somebody else I give a damn about."
p44
aa(lp45
VOr, this one, coming to us from India.
p46
aVYou can find this on YouTube,
p47
aVthe gentleman who's recumbent on a motorcycle
p48
aVwhile text messaging.
p49
aVOr what we call the "sweet gravy, stop me before I kill again!"
p50
aVThat is actually the device.
p51
aa(lp52
VWhat this is doing is, we find a \u2014
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aVa direct collision \u2014
p55
aVwe find a direct collision between availability \u2014
p56
aVand what's possible through availability \u2014
p57
aVand a fundamental human need \u2014 which we've been hearing about a lot, actually \u2014
p58
aVthe need to create shared narratives.
p59
aVWe're very good at creating personal narratives,
p60
aVbut it's the shared narratives that make us a culture.
p61
aVAnd when you're standing with someone,
p62
aVand you're on your mobile device,
p63
aVeffectively what you're saying to them is,
p64
aV"You are not as important as, literally,
p65
aValmost anything that could come to me through this device."
p66
aa(lp67
VLook around you.
p68
aVThere might be somebody on one right now,
p69
aVparticipating in multi-dimensional engagement.
p70
aa(lp71
V(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
VOur reality right now is less interesting
p74
aVthan the story we're going to tell about it later.
p75
aa(lp76
VThis one I love.
p77
aVThis poor kid, clearly a prop \u2014
p78
aVdon't get me wrong, a willing prop \u2014
p79
aVbut the kiss that's being documented kind of looks like it sucks.
p80
aa(lp81
VThis is the sound of one hand clapping.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo, as we lose the context of our identity,
p84
aVit becomes incredibly important
p85
aVthat what you share becomes the context of shared narrative,
p86
aVbecomes the context in which we live.
p87
aVThe stories that we tell \u2014 what we push out \u2014
p88
aVbecomes who we are.
p89
aVPeople aren't simply projecting identity,
p90
aVthey're creating it.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd so that's the request I have for everybody in this room.
p93
aVWe are creating the technology
p94
aVthat is going to create the new shared experience,
p95
aVwhich will create the new world.
p96
aVAnd so my request is,
p97
aVplease, let's make technologies
p98
aVthat make people more human,
p99
aVand not less.
p100
aa(lp101
VThank you.
