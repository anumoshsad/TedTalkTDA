VNine years ago, I worked
p4
aVfor the U.S. government in Iraq,
p5
aVhelping rebuild the electricity infrastructure.
p6
aVAnd I was there, and I worked in that job
p7
aVbecause I believe that technology
p8
aVcan improve people's lives.
p9
aVOne afternoon, I had tea with a storekeeper
p10
aVat the Al Rasheed Hotel in Baghdad,
p11
aVand he said to me, "You Americans,
p12
aVyou can put a man on the moon,
p13
aVbut when I get home tonight,
p14
aVI won't be able to turn on my lights."
p15
aVAt the time, the U.S. government had spent
p16
aVmore than two billion dollars
p17
aVon electricity reconstruction.
p18
aVHow do you ensure technology reaches users?
p19
aVHow do you put it in their hands
p20
aVso that it is useful?
p21
aa(lp22
VSo those are the questions that my colleagues and I
p23
aVat D-Rev ask ourselves.
p24
aVAnd D-Rev is short for Design Revolution.
p25
aVAnd I took over the organization four years ago
p26
aVand really focused it on developing products
p27
aVthat actually reach users,
p28
aVand not just any users,
p29
aVbut customers who live on less than four dollars a day.
p30
aVOne of the key areas we've been working on recently
p31
aVis medical devices, and while it may not be obvious
p32
aVthat medical devices have something in common
p33
aVwith Iraq's electricity grid then,
p34
aVthere are some commonalities.
p35
aVDespite the advanced technology,
p36
aVit's not reaching the people who need it most.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo I'm going to tell you about one of the projects we've been working on,
p39
aVthe ReMotion Knee, and it's a prosthetic knee
p40
aVfor above-knee amputees.
p41
aVAnd this project started when the Jaipur Foot Organization,
p42
aVthe largest fitter of prosthetic limbs in the world,
p43
aVcame to the Bay Area and they said,
p44
aV"We need a better knee."
p45
aVChances are, if you're living on less than four dollars a day,
p46
aVand you're an amputee,
p47
aVyou've lost your limb in a vehicle accident.
p48
aVMost people think it's land mines,
p49
aVbut it's a vehicle accident.
p50
aVYou're walking by the side of the road
p51
aVand you're hit by a truck,
p52
aVor you're trying to to jump on a moving train,
p53
aVyou're late for work, and your pant leg gets caught.
p54
aVAnd the reality is that if you don't have much money,
p55
aVlike this young named Kamal right here,
p56
aVthe option you really have
p57
aVis a bamboo staff to get around.
p58
aVAnd how big a problem is this?
p59
aVThere's over three million amputees every year
p60
aVwho need a new or replacement knee.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd what are their options?
p63
aVThis is a high-end. This is what we'd call a "smart knee."
p64
aVIt's got a microprocessor inside.
p65
aVIt can pretty much do anything,
p66
aVbut it's 20,000 dollars,
p67
aVand to give you a sense of who wears this,
p68
aVveterans, American veterans coming back from Afghanistan or Iraq
p69
aVwould be fit with something like this.
p70
aVThis is a low-end titanium knee.
p71
aVIt's a polycentric knee, and all that that means
p72
aVis the mechanism, is a four-bar mechanism,
p73
aVthat mimics a natural human knee.
p74
aVBut at 1,400 dollars, it's still too expensive
p75
aVfor people like Kamal.
p76
aVAnd lastly, here you see a low-end knee.
p77
aVThis is a knee that's been designed specifically
p78
aVfor poor people.
p79
aVAnd while you have affordability,
p80
aVyou've lost on functionality.
p81
aVThe mechanism here is a single axis,
p82
aVand a single axis is like a door hinge.
p83
aVSo you can think about how unstable that would be.
p84
aVAnd this is the type of mechanism
p85
aa(lp86
Vthat the Jaipur Foot Organization was using when they were looking for a better knee,
p87
aVand I just wanted to give you a sense of what a leg system looks like,
p88
aVbecause I'm showing you all these knees
p89
aVand I imagine it's hard to think  how it all fits together.
p90
aVSo at the top you have a socket,
p91
aVand this fits over someone's residual limb,
p92
aVand everyone's residual limb is a little bit different.
p93
aVAnd then you have the knee,
p94
aVand here I've got a single axis on the knee
p95
aVso you can see how it rotates,
p96
aVand then a pylon, and then a foot.
p97
aVAnd we've been able to develop a knee,
p98
aVa polycentric knee, so that type of knee
p99
aVthat acts like a human knee, mimics human gait,
p100
aVfor 80 dollars retail.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Applause)
p103
aa(lp104
VBut the key is, you can have this great invention,
p105
aVyou can have this great design, but how do you get it
p106
aVto the people who most need it?
p107
aVHow do you ensure it gets to them and it improves their lives?
p108
aa(lp109
VSo at D-Rev, we've done some other projects,
p110
aVand we looked at three things that we really believe
p111
aVgets technologies to customers, to users,
p112
aVto people who need it.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd the first thing is that the product  needs to be world class.
p115
aVIt needs to perform on par
p116
aVor better than the best products on the market.
p117
aVRegardless of your income level,
p118
aVyou want the most beautiful,
p119
aVthe best product that there is.
p120
aVI'm going to show you a video now
p121
aVof a man named Ash. You can see him walking.
p122
aVHe's wearing the same knee system here
p123
aVwith a single axis knee.
p124
aVAnd he's doing a 10-meter walk test.
p125
aVAnd you'll notice that he's struggling  with stability as he's walking.
p126
aVAnd something that's not obvious, that you can't see,
p127
aVis that it's psychologically draining
p128
aVto walk and to be preventing yourself from falling.
p129
aVNow this is a video of Kamal.
p130
aVYou remember Kamal earlier, holding the bamboo staff.
p131
aVHe's wearing one of the earlier versions of our knee,
p132
aVand he's doing that same 10-meter walk test.
p133
aVAnd you can see his stability is much better.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo world class isn't just about technical performance.
p136
aVIt's also about human performance.
p137
aVAnd most medical devices, we've learned,
p138
aVas we've dug in, are really designed for Westerners,
p139
aVfor wealthier economies.
p140
aVBut the reality is our users, our customers,
p141
aVthey do different things. They sit cross-legged more.
p142
aVWe see that they squat. They kneel in prayer.
p143
aVAnd we designed our knee to have the greatest range of motion
p144
aVof almost any other knee on the market.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo the second thing we learned, and this leads
p147
aVinto my second point, which is that we believe
p148
aVthat products need to be designed to be user-centric.
p149
aVAnd at D-Rev, we go one step further and we say
p150
aVyou need to be user-obsessed.
p151
aVSo it's not just the end user that you're thinking about,
p152
aVbut everyone who interacts with the product,
p153
aVso, for example, the prosthetist who fits the knee,
p154
aVbut also the context in which the knee is being fit.
p155
aVWhat is the local market like?
p156
aVHow do all these components get to the clinic?
p157
aVDo they all get there on time? The supply chain.
p158
aVEverything that goes into ensuring
p159
aVthat this product gets to the end user,
p160
aVand it goes in as part of the system, and it's used.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo I wanted to show you some of the iterations
p163
aVwe did between the first version, the Jaipur Knee,
p164
aVso this is it right here.
p165
aV(Clicking)
p166
aVNotice anything about it?
p167
aVIt clicks.
p168
aVWe'd seen that users had actually modified it.
p169
aVSo do you see that black strip right there?
p170
aVThat's a homemade noise dampener.
p171
aVWe also saw that our users had modified it
p172
aVin other ways.
p173
aVYou can see there that that particular amputee,
p174
aVhe had wrapped bandages around the knee.
p175
aVHe'd made a cosmesis.
p176
aVAnd if you look at the knee,
p177
aVit's got those pointy edges, right?
p178
aVSo if you're wearing it under pants or a skirt
p179
aVor a sari, it's really obvious
p180
aVthat you're wearing a prosthetic limb,
p181
aVand in societies where there's social stigma around being disabled,
p182
aVpeople are particularly acute about this.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo I'm going to show you some of the modifications we did.
p185
aVWe did a lot of iterations, not just  around this, but some other things.
p186
aVBut here we have the version three,  the ReMotion Knee,
p187
aVbut if you look in here, you can see
p188
aVthe noise dampener. It's quieter.
p189
aVThe other thing we did is that we smoothed the profile.
p190
aVWe made it thinner.
p191
aVAnd something that's not obvious is that we
p192
aVdesigned it for mass production.
p193
aa(lp194
VAnd this goes into my last point.
p195
aVWe really, truly believe that if a product
p196
aVis going to reach users at the scale that it's needed,
p197
aVit needs to be market-driven,
p198
aVand market-driven means that products are sold.
p199
aVThey're not donated. They're not heavily subsidized.
p200
aVOur product needs to be designed to offer value
p201
aVto the end user.
p202
aVIt also has to be designed to be very affordable.
p203
aVBut a product that is valued by a customer
p204
aVis used by a customer,
p205
aVand use is what creates impact.
p206
aVAnd we believe that as designers,
p207
aVit holds us accountable to our customers.
p208
aVAnd with centralized manufacturing,
p209
aVyou can control the quality control,
p210
aVand you can hit that $80 price point
p211
aVwith profit margins built in.
p212
aVAnd now, those profit margins are critical,
p213
aVbecause if you want to scale, if you want to reach
p214
aVall the people in the world who possibly need a knee,
p215
aVit needs to be economically sustainable.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo I want to give you a sense of where we are at.
p218
aVWe have fit over 5,000 amputees,
p219
aVand one of the big indicators we're looking at, of course,
p220
aVis, does it improve lives?
p221
aVWell, the standard is, is someone
p222
aVstill wearing their knee six months later?
p223
aVThe industry average is about 65 percent.
p224
aVOurs is 79 percent,
p225
aVand we're hoping to get that higher.
p226
aVRight now, our knees are worn in 12 countries.
p227
aVThis is where we want to get, though,
p228
aVin the next three years.
p229
aVWe'll double the impact in 2015,
p230
aVand we'll double it each of the following years after that.
p231
aVBut then we hit a new challenge,
p232
aVand that's the number of skilled prosthetists
p233
aVwho are able to fit knees.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo I want to end with a story of Pournima.
p236
aVPournima was 18 years old
p237
aVwhen she was in a car accident where she lost her leg,
p238
aVand she traveled 12 hours by train
p239
aVto come to the clinic to be fit with a knee,
p240
aVand while all of the amputees who wear our knees
p241
aVaffect us as the designers,
p242
aVshe's particularly meaningful to me  as an engineer and as a woman,
p243
aVbecause she was in school,
p244
aVshe had just started school to study engineering.
p245
aVAnd she said, "Well, now that I can walk again,
p246
aVI can go back and complete my studies."
p247
aVAnd to me she represents the next generation
p248
aVof engineers solving problems
p249
aVand ensuring meaningful technologies
p250
aVreach their users.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo thank you.
