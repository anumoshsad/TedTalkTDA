VFor the last five years,

aVI have documented the lives of teenage mothers in Latin America.

aVI started with a series of photographs

VI am the son of a teenage mother
p16
aVand my sister became a teenage mother when she was 16.
p17
aVI began exploring the theme
p18
aVto better understand myself and my origins.
p19
aa(lp20
VIn developing countries,
p21
aV7.3 million girls under the age of 18
p22
aVgive birth each year.
p23
aVProjections suggest
p24
aVthat the teen pregnancy rate in Latin America
p25
aVwill be the highest in the world
p26
aVfor the next 80 years.
p27
aVIn Mexico, almost one in two sexually active adolescents
p28
aVget pregnant between the ages of 12 to 19 years old.
p29
aVTeenage pregnancy is not just about young pregnancies.
p30
aVIt is about gender violence,
p31
aVphysical, symbolic, psychological and economic violence.
p32
aVGirls who become pregnant before they are 18
p33
aVrarely achieve an adequate standard of living.
p34
aVThe pattern of poverty
p35
aVand limited access to education and health care
p36
aVare a common thread among teen pregnancies.
p37
aVIf a girl in Latin America gets pregnant before she is 16,
p38
aVthe risk of maternal death increases fourfold
p39
aVover a woman in their 20s.
p40
aVAnd somehow, in spite of all this,
p41
aVmotherhood also imparts a status
p42
aVand a respect to the adolescent in her community.
p43
aVHer child becomes her life project.
p44
aVA high percentage of girls under the age of 18 are single mothers,
p45
aVas was my mother.
p46
aa(lp47
VWhen I was learning to be a parent,
p48
aVI began to focus on the relationship between father and child,
p49
aVa subject rarely given much attention.
p50
aVI wanted to highlight the ways
p51
aVin which we need to educate boys differently
p52
aVwithout turning them into macho men.
p53
aVIn some cases, families send boys to school but not girls.
p54
aVThe persistence of teen pregnancy heightened the gender equity gap
p55
aVand the continued existence of traditional roles.
p56
aVIf we were to allow equal opportunities to girls,
p57
aVthey could gain independence.
p58
aVEducating girls is key
p59
aVto breaking cycles of teen pregnancies.
p60
aVGirls getting pregnant between the ages of 10 to 14
p61
aVare an extremely vulnerable population,
p62
aVand they can be easy prey for men twice their age.
p63
aVThere are many cases of violence,
p64
aVincest and sexual abuse
p65
aVperpetrated against this group.
p66
aa(lp67
VThis is Gloria.
p68
aVShe became a teen mother at the age of 12,
p69
aVa result of the ongoing abuse by her father,
p70
aVwho was also raping Gloria's two sisters,
p71
aVages 8 and 16.
p72
aVIn this portrait, she has butterflies in her hair,
p73
aVsymbols of resurrection.
p74
aVFor me, it's extremely important to portray this mother with dignity.
p75
aa(lp76
VPregnancies among girls younger than 15 is a growing trend,
p77
aVnot only in Latin America,
p78
aVbut many developing countries in the world.
p79
aVOur region is marred by bad social and cultural inequalities,
p80
aVand teen pregnancy further increases this divide.
p81
aVI am committing to being part of the solution
p82
aVby making work that implicitly and emphatically
p83
aVcalls for human rights for girls.
p84
aVThe day life projects for boys and girls become similar,
p85
aVteenage pregnancy will decrease.
p86
