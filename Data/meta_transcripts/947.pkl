VEveryone, please think of your biggest personal goal.
p4
aVFor real \u2014 you can take a second. You've got to feel this to learn it.
p5
aVTake a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal, okay?
p6
aVImagine deciding right now that you're going to do it.
p7
aVImagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do.
p8
aVImagine their congratulations,
p9
aVand their high image of you.
p10
aVDoesn't it feel good to say it out loud?
p11
aVDon't you feel one step closer already,
p12
aVlike it's already becoming part of your identity?
p13
aa(lp14
VWell, bad news: you should have kept your mouth shut,
p15
aVbecause that good feeling
p16
aVnow will make you less likely to do it.
p17
aVThe repeated psychology tests have proven
p18
aVthat telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen.
p19
aVAny time you have a goal,
p20
aVthere are some steps that need to be done,
p21
aVsome work that needs to be done in order to achieve it.
p22
aVIdeally you would not be satisfied until you'd actually done the work.
p23
aVBut when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it,
p24
aVpsychologists have found that it's called a "social reality."
p25
aVThe mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done.
p26
aVAnd then because you've felt that satisfaction,
p27
aVyou're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VSo this goes against conventional wisdom
p32
aVthat we should tell our friends our goals, right?
p33
aVSo they hold us to it.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo, let's look at the proof.
p36
aV1926: Kurt Lewin, founder of social psychology,
p37
aVcalled this "substitution."
p38
aV1933: Wera Mahler found when it was acknowledged by others,
p39
aVit felt real in the mind.
p40
aV1982, Peter Gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this,
p41
aVand in 2009,
p42
aVhe did some new tests that were published.
p43
aa(lp44
VIt goes like this:
p45
aV163 people across four separate tests.
p46
aVEveryone wrote down their personal goal.
p47
aVThen half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room,
p48
aVand half didn't.
p49
aVThen everyone was given 45 minutes of work
p50
aVthat would directly lead them towards their goal,
p51
aVbut they were told that they could stop at any time.
p52
aVNow, those who kept their mouths shut
p53
aVworked the entire 45 minutes on average,
p54
aVand when asked afterward,
p55
aVsaid that they felt that they had a long way to go still
p56
aVto achieve their goal.
p57
aVBut those who had announced it
p58
aVquit after only 33 minutes, on average,
p59
aVand when asked afterward,
p60
aVsaid that they felt much closer to achieving their goal.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo if this is true, what can we do?
p63
aVWell, you could resist the temptation to announce your goal.
p64
aVYou can delay the gratification that the social acknowledgment brings,
p65
aVand you can understand that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing.
p66
aVBut if you do need to talk about something,
p67
aVyou can state it in a way that gives you no satisfaction,
p68
aVsuch as, "I really want to run this marathon,
p69
aVso I need to train five times a week
p70
aVand kick my ass if I don't, okay?"
p71
aa(lp72
VSo audience, next time you're tempted to tell someone your goal,
p73
aVwhat will you say?
p74
aa(lp75
V(Silence)
p76
aa(lp77
VExactly! Well done.
