VIt began with one question:
p4
aVIf Africa was a bar, what would your country be drinking or doing?
p5
aVI kicked it off with a guess about South Africa,
p6
aVwhich wasn't exactly according to the rules
p7
aVbecause South Africa's not my country.
p8
aVBut alluding to the country's continual attempts
p9
aVto build a postracial society
p10
aVafter being ravaged for decades by apartheid,
p11
aVI tweeted, #ifafricawasabar South Africa would be drinking all kinds of alcohol
p12
aVand begging them to get along in its stomach.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd then I waited.
p15
aVAnd then I had that funny feeling where I wondered if I crossed the line.
p16
aVSo, I sent out a few other tweets about my own country
p17
aVand a few other African countries I'm familiar with.
p18
aVAnd then I waited again,
p19
aVbut this time
p20
aVI read through almost every tweet I had ever tweeted
p21
aVto convince myself,
p22
aVno, to remind myself that I'm really funny
p23
aVand that if nobody gets it, that's fine.
p24
aa(lp25
VBut luckily,
p26
aVI didn't have to do that for very long.
p27
aVVery soon, people were participating.
p28
aVIn fact, by the end of that week in July,
p29
aVthe hashtag #ifafricawasabar
p30
aVwould have garnered around 60,000 tweets,
p31
aVlit up the continent
p32
aVand made its way to publications all over the world.
p33
aa(lp34
VPeople were using the hashtag to do many different things.
p35
aVTo poke fun at their stereotypes:
p36
aV[#IfAfricaWasABar Nigeria would be outside explaining
p37
aVthat he will pay the entrance fee,
p38
aVall he needs is the bouncer's account details.]
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VTo criticize government spending:
p43
aV[#ifafricawasabar South Africa would be ordering bottles it can't pronounce
p44
aVrunning a tab it won't be able to pay]
p45
aa(lp46
VTo make light of geopolitical tensions:
p47
aV[#IfAfricaWasABar South Sudan would be the new guy
p48
aVwith serious anger management issues.]
p49
aa(lp50
VTo remind us that even in Africa
p51
aVthere are some countries we don't know exist:
p52
aV[#IfAfricaWasABar Lesotho would be that person
p53
aVwho nobody really knows but is always in the pictures.]
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd also to make fun of the countries that don't think that they're in Africa:
p56
aV[#IfAfricaWasABar Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco
p57
aVbe like "What the hell are we doing here?!!"]
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd to note the countries that had made a big turnaround:
p62
aV[#ifAfricawasabar Rwanda would be that girl
p63
aVthat comes with no money and no transport but leaves drunk, happy and rich]
p64
aa(lp65
VBut most importantly,
p66
aVpeople were using the hashtag to connect.
p67
aVPeople were connecting over their Africanness.
p68
aVSo for one week in July,
p69
aVTwitter became a real African bar.
p70
aVAnd I was really thrilled,
p71
aVmainly because I realized that Pan-Africanism could work,
p72
aVthat we had before us, between us, at our fingertips
p73
aVa platform that just needed a small spark
p74
aVto light in us a hunger for each other.
p75
aa(lp76
VMy name is Siyanda Mohutsiwa,
p77
aVI'm 22 years old
p78
aVand I am Pan-Africanist by birth.
p79
aVNow, I say I'm Pan-Africanist by birth
p80
aVbecause my parents are from two different African countries.
p81
aVMy father's from a country called Botswana in southern Africa.
p82
aVIt's only slightly bigger than Germany.
p83
aVThis year we celebrate our 50th year of stable democracy.
p84
aVAnd it has some very progressive social policies.
p85
aVMy mother's country is the Kingdom of Swaziland.
p86
aVIt's a very, very small country, also in southern Africa.
p87
aVIt is Africa's last complete monarchy.
p88
aVSo it's been ruled by a king and a royal family
p89
aVin line with their tradition,
p90
aVfor a very long time.
p91
aa(lp92
VOn paper, these countries seem very different.
p93
aVAnd when I was a kid, I could see the difference.
p94
aVIt rained a lot in one country, it didn't rain quite as much in the other.
p95
aVBut outside of that, I didn't really realize
p96
aVwhy it mattered that my parents were from two different places.
p97
aVBut it would go on to have a very peculiar effect on me.
p98
aVYou see, I was born in one country
p99
aVand raised in the other.
p100
aa(lp101
VWhen we moved to Botswana,
p102
aVI was a toddler who spoke fluent SiSwati
p103
aVand nothing else.
p104
aVSo I was being introduced to my new home,
p105
aVmy new cultural identity,
p106
aVas a complete outsider,
p107
aVincapable of comprehending anything that was being said to me
p108
aVby the family and country whose traditions I was meant to move forward.
p109
aVBut very soon, I would shed SiSwati.
p110
aVAnd when I would go back to Swaziland,
p111
aVI would be constantly confronted by how very non-Swazi I was becoming.
p112
aa(lp113
VAdd to that my entry into Africa's private school system,
p114
aVwhose entire purpose is to beat the Africanness out of you,
p115
aVand I would have a very peculiar adolescence.
p116
aVBut I think that my interest in ideas of identity was born here,
p117
aVin the strange intersection of belonging to two places at once
p118
aVbut not really belonging to either one very well
p119
aVand belonging to this vast space in between and around simultaneously.
p120
aVI became obsessed with the idea of a shared African identity.
p121
aa(lp122
VSince then, I have continued to read about politics
p123
aVand geography and identity and what all those things mean.
p124
aVI've also held on to a deep curiosity about African philosophies.
p125
aVWhen I began to read,
p126
aVI gravitated towards the works of black intellectuals
p127
aVlike Steve Biko and Frantz Fanon,
p128
aVwho tackled complex ideas
p129
aVlike decolonization and black consciousness.
p130
aVAnd when I thought, at 14, that I had digested these grand ideas,
p131
aVI moved on to the speeches of iconic African statesmen
p132
aVlike Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara
p133
aVand Congo's Patrice Lumumba.
p134
aVI read every piece of African fiction that I could get my hands on.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo when Twitter came,
p137
aVI hopped on with the enthusiasm of a teenage girl
p138
aVwhose friends are super, super bored of hearing about all this random stuff.
p139
aa(lp140
VThe year was 2011
p141
aVand all over southern Africa and the whole continent,
p142
aVaffordable data packages for smartphones and Internet surfing
p143
aVbecame much easier to get.
p144
aVSo my generation, we were sending messages to each other on this platform
p145
aVthat just needed 140 characters and a little bit of creativity.
p146
aVOn long commutes to work,
p147
aVin lectures that some of us should have been paying attention to,
p148
aVon our lunch breaks,
p149
aVwe would communicate as much as we could
p150
aVabout the everyday realities of being young and African.
p151
aa(lp152
VBut of course, this luxury was not available to everybody.
p153
aVSo this meant that if you were a teenage girl in Botswana
p154
aVand you wanted to have fun on the Internet,
p155
aVone, you had to tweet in English.
p156
aVTwo, you had to follow more than just the three other people you knew online.
p157
aVYou had to follow South Africans, Zimbabweans, Ghanaians, Nigerians.
p158
aVAnd suddenly, your whole world opened up.
p159
aVAnd my whole world did open up.
p160
aa(lp161
VI followed vibrant Africans who were travelling around the continent,
p162
aVtaking pictures of themselves
p163
aVand posting them under the hashtag #myafrica.
p164
aVBecause at that time,
p165
aVif you were to search Africa on Twitter or on Google
p166
aVor any kind of social media,
p167
aVyou would think that the entire continent was just pictures of animals
p168
aVand white guys drinking cocktails in hotel resorts.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VBut Africans were using this platform
p173
aVto take some kind of ownership of the tourism sectors.
p174
aVIt was Africans taking selfies on the beaches of Nigeria.
p175
aVIt was Africans in cocktail bars in Nairobi.
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd these were the same Africans that I began to meet
p178
aVin my own travels around the continent.
p179
aVWe would discuss African literature, politics, economic policy.
p180
aVBut almost invariably, every single time,
p181
aVwe would end up discussing Twitter.
p182
aVAnd that's when I realized what this was.
p183
aVWe were standing in the middle of something amazing,
p184
aVbecause for the first time ever
p185
aVyoung Africans could discuss the future of our continent in real time,
p186
aVwithout the restriction of borders, finances and watchful governments.
p187
aa(lp188
VBecause the little known truth is
p189
aVmany Africans know a lot less about other African countries
p190
aVthan some Westerners might know about Africa as a whole.
p191
aVThis is by accident,
p192
aVbut sometimes, it's by design.
p193
aVFor example, in apartheid South Africa,
p194
aVblack South Africans were constantly being bombarded
p195
aVwith this message that any country ruled by black people
p196
aVwas destined for failure.
p197
aVAnd this was done to convince them
p198
aVthat they were much better off under crushing white rule
p199
aVthan they were living in a black and free nation.
p200
aVAdd to that Africa's colonial, archaic education system,
p201
aVwhich has been unthinkingly carried over from the 1920s \u2014
p202
aVand at the age of 15, I could name all the various causes
p203
aVof the wars that had happened in Europe in the past 200 years,
p204
aVbut I couldn't name the president of my neighboring country.
p205
aVAnd to me, this doesn't make any sense
p206
aVbecause whether we like it or not,
p207
aVthe fates of African people are deeply intertwined.
p208
aa(lp209
VWhen disaster hits, when turmoil hits,
p210
aVwe share the consequences.
p211
aVWhen Burundians flee political turmoil,
p212
aVthey go to us,
p213
aVto other African countries.
p214
aVAfrica has six of the world's largest refugee centers.
p215
aVWhat was once a Burundian problem
p216
aVbecomes an African problem.
p217
aVSo to me, there are no Sudanese problems
p218
aVor South African problems or Kenyan problems,
p219
aVonly African problems
p220
aVbecause eventually, we share the turmoil.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo if we share the problems,
p223
aVwhy aren't we doing a better job of sharing the successes?
p224
aVHow can we do that?
p225
aVWell, in the long term,
p226
aVwe can shoot towards increasing inter-African trade,
p227
aVremoving borders and putting pressure on leaders
p228
aVto fulfill regional agreements they've already signed.
p229
aVBut I think that the biggest way for Africa to share its successes
p230
aVis to foster something I like to call social Pan-Africanism.
p231
aa(lp232
VNow, political Pan-Africanism already exists,
p233
aVso I'm not inventing anything totally new here.
p234
aVBut political Pan-Africanism
p235
aVis usually the African unity of the political elite.
p236
aVAnd who does that benefit?
p237
aVWell, African leaders, almost exclusively.
p238
aVNo, what I'm talking about
p239
aVis the Pan-Africanism of the ordinary African.
p240
aVYoung Africans like me,
p241
aVwe are bursting with creative energy,
p242
aVwith innovative ideas.
p243
aVBut with bad governance and shaky institutions,
p244
aVall of this potential could go to waste.
p245
aVOn a continent where more than a handful of leaders
p246
aVhave been in power longer
p247
aVthan the majority of the populations has been alive,
p248
aVwe are in desperate need of something new,
p249
aVsomething that works.
p250
aVAnd I think that thing is social Pan-Africanism.
p251
aa(lp252
VMy dream is that young Africans
p253
aVstop allowing borders and circumstance to suffocate our innovation.
p254
aVMy dream is that when a young African comes up with something brilliant,
p255
aVthey don't say, "Well, this wouldn't work in my country,"
p256
aVand then give up.
p257
aVMy dream is that young Africans begin to realize
p258
aVthat the entire continent is our canvas, is our home.
p259
aVUsing the Internet, we can begin to think collaboratively,
p260
aVwe can begin to innovate together.
p261
aVIn Africa, we say, "If you want to go fast, you go alone,
p262
aVbut if you want to go far, you go together."
p263
aVAnd I believe that social Pan-Africanism is how we can go far together.
p264
aa(lp265
VAnd this is already happening.
p266
aVAccess to these online networks has given young Africans
p267
aVsomething we've always had to violently take: a voice.
p268
aVWe now have a platform.
p269
aVBefore now, if you wanted to hear from the youth in Africa,
p270
aVyou waited for the 65-year-old minister of youth \u2014
p271
aa(lp272
V(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
Vto wake up in the morning,
p275
aVtake his heartburn medication
p276
aVand then tell you the plans he has for your generation
p277
aVin 20 years time.
p278
aVBefore now, if you wanted to be heard by your possibly tyrannical government,
p279
aVyou were pushed to protest, suffer the consequences
p280
aVand have your fingers crossed
p281
aVthat some Western paper somewhere might make someone care.
p282
aVBut now we have opportunities to back each other up
p283
aVin ways we never could before.
p284
aa(lp285
VWe support South African students
p286
aVwho are marching against ridiculously high tertiary fees.
p287
aVWe support Zimbabwean women who are marching to parliament.
p288
aVWe support Angolan journalists who are being illegally detained.
p289
aVFor the first time ever,
p290
aVAfrican pain and African aspiration
p291
aVhas the ability to be witnessed
p292
aVby those who can empathize with it the most:
p293
aVother Africans.
p294
aa(lp295
VI believe that with a social Pan-Africanist thinking
p296
aVand using the Internet as a tool,
p297
aVwe can begin to rescue each other,
p298
aVand ultimately, to rescue ourselves.
p299
