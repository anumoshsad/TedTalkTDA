VFive years ago, I had my dream job.
p4
aVI was a foreign correspondent in the Middle East
p5
aVreporting for ABC News.
p6
aVBut there was a crack in the wall,
p7
aVa problem with our industry,
p8
aVthat I felt we needed to fix.
p9
aVYou see, I got to the Middle East right around the end of 2007,
p10
aVwhich was just around the midpoint
p11
aVof the Iraq War.
p12
aVBut by the time I got there, it was already nearly impossible
p13
aVto find stories about Iraq on air.
p14
aVCoverage had dropped across the board,
p15
aVacross networks.
p16
aVAnd of the stories that did make it,
p17
aVmore than 80 percent of them were about us.
p18
aVWe were missing the stories about Iraq,
p19
aVthe people who live there,
p20
aVand what was happening to them under the weight of the war.
p21
aa(lp22
VAfghanistan had already fallen off the agenda.
p23
aVThere were less than one percent of all news stories in 2008
p24
aVthat went to the war in Afghanistan.
p25
aVIt was the longest war in US history,
p26
aVbut information was so scarce
p27
aVthat schoolteachers we spoke to
p28
aVtold us they had trouble explaining to their students
p29
aVwhat we were doing there,
p30
aVwhen those students had parents
p31
aVwho were fighting and sometimes dying overseas.
p32
aa(lp33
VWe had drawn a blank,
p34
aVand it wasn't just Iraq and Afghanistan.
p35
aVFrom conflict zones to climate change
p36
aVto all sorts of issues around crises in public health,
p37
aVwe were missing what I call the species-level issues,
p38
aVbecause as a species, they could actually sink us.
p39
aVAnd by failing to understand the complex issues of our time,
p40
aVwe were facing certain practical implications.
p41
aVHow were we going to solve problems
p42
aVthat we didn't fundamentally understand,
p43
aVthat we couldn't track in real time,
p44
aVand where the people working on the issues
p45
aVwere invisible to us
p46
aVand sometimes invisible to each other?
p47
aa(lp48
VWhen you look back on Iraq,
p49
aVthose years when we were missing the story,
p50
aVwere the years when the society was falling apart,
p51
aVwhen we were setting the conditions for what would become the rise of ISIS,
p52
aVthe ISIS takeover of Mosul
p53
aVand terrorist violence that would spread
p54
aVbeyond Iraq's borders to the rest of the world.
p55
aa(lp56
VJust around that time where I was making that observation,
p57
aVI looked across the border of Iraq
p58
aVand noticed there was another story we were missing:
p59
aVthe war in Syria.
p60
aVIf you were a Middle-East specialist, you knew that Syria was that important
p61
aVfrom the start.
p62
aVBut it ended up being, really,
p63
aVone of the forgotten stories of the Arab Spring.
p64
aVI saw the implications up front.
p65
aVSyria is intimately tied to regional security,
p66
aVto global stability.
p67
aVI felt like we couldn't let that become
p68
aVanother one of the stories we left behind.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo I left my big TV job to start a website, called "Syria Deeply."
p71
aVIt was designed to be a news and information source
p72
aVthat made it easier to understand a complex issue,
p73
aVand for the past four years, it's been a resource
p74
aVfor policymakers and professionals working on the conflict in Syria.
p75
aVWe built a business model
p76
aVbased on consistent, high-quality information,
p77
aVand convening the top minds on the issue.
p78
aVAnd we found it was a model that scaled.
p79
aVWe got passionate requests to do other things "Deeply."
p80
aVSo we started to work our way down the list.
p81
aa(lp82
VI'm just one of many entrepreneurs,
p83
aVand we are just one of many start-ups
p84
aVtrying to fix what's wrong with news.
p85
aVAll of us in the trenches know
p86
aVthat something is wrong with the news industry.
p87
aVIt's broken.
p88
aVTrust in the media has hit an all-time low.
p89
aVAnd the statistic you're seeing up there is from September \u2014
p90
aVit's arguably gotten worse.
p91
aVBut we can fix this.
p92
aVWe can fix the news.
p93
aVI know that that's true.
p94
aVYou can call me an idealist; I call myself an industrious optimist.
p95
aVAnd I know there are a lot of us out there.
p96
aVWe have ideas for how to make things better,
p97
aVand I want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own work.
p98
aa(lp99
VIdea number one:
p100
aVwe need news that's built on deep-domain knowledge.
p101
aVGiven the waves and waves of layoffs at newsrooms across the country,
p102
aVwe've lost the art of specialization.
p103
aVBeat reporting is an endangered thing.
p104
aVWhen it comes to foreign news,
p105
aVthe way we can fix that is by working with more local journalists,
p106
aVtreating them like our partners and collaborators,
p107
aVnot just fixers who fetch us phone numbers and sound bites.
p108
aVOur local reporters in Syria and across Africa and across Asia
p109
aVbring us stories that we certainly would not have found on our own.
p110
aVLike this one from the suburbs of Damascus, about a wheelchair race
p111
aVthat gave hope to those wounded in the war.
p112
aVOr this one from Sierra Leone,
p113
aVabout a local chief who curbed the spread of Ebola
p114
aVby self-organizing a quarantine in his district.
p115
aVOr this one from the border of Pakistan,
p116
aVabout Afghan refugees being forced to return home before they are ready,
p117
aVunder the threat of police intimidation.
p118
aVOur local journalists are our mentors.
p119
aVThey teach us something new every day,
p120
aVand they bring us stories that are important for all of us to know.
p121
aa(lp122
VIdea number two:
p123
aVwe need a kind of Hippocratic oath for the news industry,
p124
aVa pledge to first do no harm.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Applause)
p127
aa(lp128
VJournalists need to be tough.
p129
aVWe need to speak truth to power,
p130
aVbut we also need to be responsible.
p131
aVWe need to live up to our own ideals,
p132
aVand we need to recognize
p133
aVwhen what we're doing could potentially harm society,
p134
aVwhere we lose track of journalism as a public service.
p135
aa(lp136
VI watched us cover the Ebola crisis.
p137
aVWe launched Ebola Deeply. We did our best.
p138
aVBut what we saw was a public
p139
aVthat was flooded with hysterical and sensational coverage,
p140
aVsometimes inaccurate, sometimes completely wrong.
p141
aVPublic health experts tell me that that actually cost us in human lives,
p142
aVbecause by sparking more panic and by sometimes getting the facts wrong,
p143
aVwe made it harder for people to resolve
p144
aVwhat was actually happening on the ground.
p145
aVAll that noise made it harder to make the right decisions.
p146
aa(lp147
VWe can do better as an industry,
p148
aVbut it requires us recognizing how we got it wrong last time,
p149
aVand deciding not to go that way next time.
p150
aVIt's a choice.
p151
aVWe have to resist the temptation to use fear for ratings.
p152
aVAnd that decision has to be made in the individual newsroom
p153
aVand with the individual news executive.
p154
aVBecause the next deadly virus that comes around
p155
aVcould be much worse and the consequences much higher,
p156
aVif we do what we did last time;
p157
aVif our reporting isn't responsible and it isn't right.
p158
aa(lp159
VThe third idea?
p160
aVWe need to embrace complexity
p161
aVif we want to make sense of a complex world.
p162
aVEmbrace complexity \u2014
p163
aa(lp164
V(Applause)
p165
aa(lp166
Vnot treat the world simplistically, because simple isn't accurate.
p167
aVWe live in a complex world.
p168
aVNews is adult education.
p169
aVIt's our job as journalists to get elbow deep in complexity
p170
aVand to find new ways to make it easier for everyone else to understand.
p171
aVIf we don't do that,
p172
aVif we pretend there are just simple answers,
p173
aVwe're leading everyone off a steep cliff.
p174
aVUnderstanding complexity is the only way to know the real threats
p175
aVthat are around the corner.
p176
aVIt's our responsibility to translate those threats
p177
aVand to help you understand what's real,
p178
aVso you can be prepared and know what it takes to be ready
p179
aVfor what comes next.
p180
aa(lp181
VI am an industrious optimist.
p182
aVI do believe we can fix what's broken.
p183
aVWe all want to.
p184
aVThere are great journalists out there doing great work \u2014
p185
aVwe just need new formats.
p186
aVI honestly believe this is a time of reawakening,
p187
aVreimagining what we can do.
p188
aVI believe we can fix what's broken.
p189
aVI know we can fix the news.
p190
aVI know it's worth trying,
p191
aVand I truly believe that in the end,
p192
aVwe're going to get this right.
p193
aa(lp194
VThank you.
