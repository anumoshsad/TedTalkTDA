VBecause of what I'm about to say,
p4
aVI really should establish my green credentials.
p5
aVWhen I was a small boy, I took my pledge
p6
aVas an American, to save and faithfully defend from waste
p7
aVthe natural resources of my country,
p8
aVits air, soil and minerals, its forests, waters and wildlife.
p9
aVAnd I've stuck to that.
p10
aVStanford, I majored in ecology and evolution.
p11
aV1968, I put out the Whole Earth Catalog. Was "mister natural" for a while.
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd then worked for the Jerry Brown administration.
p14
aVThe Brown administration, and a bunch of my friends,
p15
aVbasically leveled the energy efficiency of California,
p16
aVso it's the same now, 30 years later,
p17
aVeven though our economy has gone up 80 percent, per capita.
p18
aVAnd we are putting out less greenhouse gasses than any other state.
p19
aVCalifornia is basically the equivalent of Europe, in this.
p20
aa(lp21
VThis year, Whole Earth Catalog has a supplement that I'll preview today,
p22
aVcalled Whole Earth Discipline.
p23
aVThe dominant demographic event of our time
p24
aVis this screamingly rapid urbanization
p25
aVthat we have going on.
p26
aVBy mid-century we'll be about 80 percent urban,
p27
aVand that's mostly in the developing world,
p28
aVwhere that's happening.
p29
aVIt's interesting, because history is driven to a large degree
p30
aVby the size of cities.
p31
aVThe developing world now has all of the biggest cities,
p32
aVand they are developing three times faster than the developed countries,
p33
aVand nine times bigger.
p34
aVIt's qualitatively different.
p35
aVThey are the drivers of history, as we see by looking at history.
p36
aa(lp37
V1,000 years ago this is what the world looked like.
p38
aVWell we now have a distribution of urban power
p39
aVsimilar to what we had 1,000 years ago.
p40
aVIn other words, the rise of the West,
p41
aVdramatic as it was, is over.
p42
aVThe aggregate numbers are absolutely overwhelming:
p43
aV1.3 million people a week coming to town,
p44
aVdecade after decade.
p45
aVWhat's really going on?
p46
aVWell, what's going on is the villages of the world are emptying out.
p47
aVSubsistence farming is drying up basically.
p48
aa(lp49
VPeople are following opportunity into town.
p50
aVAnd this is why.
p51
aVI used to have a very romantic idea about villages,
p52
aVand it's because I never lived in one.
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aVBecause in town \u2014
p55
aVthis is the bustling squatter city
p56
aVof Kibera, near Nairobi \u2014
p57
aVthey see action. They see opportunity.
p58
aVThey see a cash economy that they were not able to participate in
p59
aVback in the subsistence farm.
p60
aa(lp61
VAs you go around these places there's plenty of aesthetics.
p62
aVThere is plenty going on.
p63
aVThey are poor, but they are intensely urban. And they are intensely creative.
p64
aVThe aggregate numbers now
p65
aVare that basically squatters,
p66
aVall one billion of them, are building the urban world,
p67
aVwhich means they're building the world \u2014
p68
aVpersonally, one by one, family by family,
p69
aVclan by clan, neighborhood by neighborhood.
p70
aVThey start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by.
p71
aVThey even build their own infrastructure.
p72
aVWell, steal their own infrastructure, at first.
p73
aVCable TV, water, the whole gamut, all gets stolen.
p74
aVAnd then gradually gentrifies.
p75
aa(lp76
VIt is not the case that slums undermine prosperity,
p77
aVnot the working slums; they help create prosperity.
p78
aVSo in a town like Mumbai, which is half slums,
p79
aVit's 1/6th of the GDP of India.
p80
aVSocial capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense.
p81
aVThese people are valuable as a group.
p82
aVAnd that's how they work.
p83
aa(lp84
VThere is a lot of people who think about all these poor people,
p85
aV"Oh there's terrible things. We've got to fix their housing."
p86
aVIt used to be, "Oh we've got to get them phone service."
p87
aVNow they're showing us how they do their phone service.
p88
aVFamine mostly is a rural event now.
p89
aVThere are things they care about.
p90
aVAnd this is where we can help.
p91
aVAnd the nations they're in can help.
p92
aVAnd they are helping each other solve these issues.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd you go to a nice dense place like this slum in Mumbai.
p95
aVYou look at that lane on the right.
p96
aVAnd you can ask, "Okay what's going on there?"
p97
aVThe answer is, "Everything."
p98
aVThis is better than a mall. It's much denser.
p99
aVIt's much more interactive.
p100
aVAnd the scale is terrific.
p101
aVThe main event is, these are not people crushed by poverty.
p102
aVThese are people busy getting out of poverty
p103
aVjust as fast as they can.
p104
aVThey're helping each other do it.
p105
aVThey're doing it through an outlaw thing,
p106
aVthe informal economy.
p107
aVThe informal economy, it's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics:
p108
aVit's not supposed to be there, but it's huge.
p109
aVWe don't understand how it works yet, but we have to.
p110
aa(lp111
VFurthermore, people in the informal economy,
p112
aVthe gray economy \u2014
p113
aVas time goes by,
p114
aVcrime is happening around them. And they can join the criminal world,
p115
aVor they can join the legitimate world.
p116
aVWe should be able to make that choice
p117
aVeasier for them to get toward the legitimate world,
p118
aVbecause if we don't, they will go toward the criminal world.
p119
aVThere's all kinds of activity.
p120
aa(lp121
VIn Dharavi the slum performs not only
p122
aVa lot of services for itself,
p123
aVbut it performs services for the city at large.
p124
aVAnd one of the main events are these ad-hoc schools.
p125
aVParents pool their money to hire some local teachers
p126
aVto a private, tiny, unofficial school.
p127
aVEducation is more possible in the cities, and that changes the world.
p128
aVSo you see some interesting, typical, urban things.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo one thing slammed up against another,
p131
aVsuch as in Sao Paulo here.
p132
aVThat's what cities do. That's how they create value,
p133
aVis by slamming things together.
p134
aVIn this case, supply right next to demand.
p135
aVSo the maids and the gardeners and the guards
p136
aVthat live in this lively part of town on the left
p137
aVwalk to work, in the boring, rich neighborhood.
p138
aa(lp139
VProximity is amazing.
p140
aVWe are learning about how dense proximity can be.
p141
aVConnectivity between the city and the country
p142
aVis what's going to keep the country good,
p143
aVbecause the city has interesting ways of doing things.
p144
aVThis is what makes cities \u2014
p145
aV(Applause)
p146
aVthis is what makes cities so green in the developing world.
p147
aa(lp148
VBecause people leave the poverty trap, an ecological disaster
p149
aVof subsistence farms, and head to town.
p150
aVAnd when they're gone the natural environment
p151
aVstarts to come back very rapidly.
p152
aVAnd those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops
p153
aVto send food to the new growing markets in town.
p154
aVSo if you want to save a village, you do it with a good road,
p155
aVor with a good cell phone connection, and ideally some grid electrical power.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo the event is: we're a city planet. That just happened.
p158
aVMore than half.
p159
aVThe numbers are considerable. A billion live in the squatter cities now.
p160
aVAnother billion is expected.
p161
aVThat's more than a sixth of humanity living a certain way.
p162
aVAnd that will determine a lot of how we function.
p163
aa(lp164
VNow, for us environmentalists,
p165
aVmaybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb.
p166
aVPeople get into town.
p167
aVThe immediately have fewer children.
p168
aVThey don't even have to get rich yet. Just the opportunity of
p169
aVcoming up in the world means they will have fewer, higher-quality kids,
p170
aVand the birthrate goes down radically.
p171
aa(lp172
VVery interesting side effect here,
p173
aVhere's a slide from Phillip Longman.
p174
aVShows what is happening.
p175
aVAs we have more and more old people, like me,
p176
aVand fewer and fewer babies.
p177
aVAnd they are regionally separated.
p178
aVWhat you're getting is a world which is
p179
aVold folks, and old cities, going around doing things the old way,
p180
aVin the north.
p181
aVAnd young people in brand new cities they're inventing,
p182
aVdoing new things, in the south.
p183
aVWhere do you think the action is going to be?
p184
aa(lp185
VShift of subject. Quickly drop by climate.
p186
aVThe climate news, I'm sorry to say, is going to keep getting worse
p187
aVthan we think, faster than we think.
p188
aVClimate is a profoundly complex, nonlinear system,
p189
aVfull of runaway positive feedbacks,
p190
aVhidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points.
p191
aVHere's just a few samples.
p192
aVWe're going to keep being surprised. And almost all
p193
aVthe surprises are going to be bad ones.
p194
aa(lp195
VFrom your standpoint this means
p196
aVa great increase in climate refugees
p197
aVover the coming decades,
p198
aVand what goes along with that, which is resource wars
p199
aVand chaos wars,
p200
aVas we're seeing in Darfur.
p201
aVThat's what drought does.
p202
aVIt brings carrying capacity down,
p203
aVand there's not enough carrying capacity
p204
aVto support the people. And then you're in trouble.
p205
aa(lp206
VShift to the power situation.
p207
aVBaseload electricity is what it takes to run a city,
p208
aVor a city planet.
p209
aVSo far there is only three sources of baseload electricity:
p210
aVcoal, some gas,
p211
aVnuclear and hydro.
p212
aVOf those, only nuclear and hydro are green.
p213
aVCoal is what is causing the climate problems.
p214
aVAnd everyone will keep burning it
p215
aVbecause it's so cheap, until governments make it expensive.
p216
aVWind and solar can't help, because so far we don't have a way to store that energy.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo with hydro maxed out,
p219
aVcoal and lose the climate,
p220
aVor nuclear, which is the current operating low-carbon source,
p221
aVand maybe save the climate.
p222
aVAnd if we can eventually get good solar in space,
p223
aVthat also could help.
p224
aVBecause remember, this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world
p225
aVin the villages and in the cities.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo, between coal and nuclear,
p228
aVcompare their waste products.
p229
aVIf all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear,
p230
aVthe amount of waste that would be added up
p231
aVwould fit in a Coke can.
p232
aVWhereas a coal-burning plant,
p233
aVa normal one gigawatt coal plant, burns 80 rail cars of coal a day,
p234
aVeach car having 100 tons.
p235
aVAnd it puts 18 thousand tons
p236
aVof carbon dioxide in the air.
p237
aVSo and then when you compare the lifetime emissions
p238
aVof these various energy forms,
p239
aVnuclear is about even with solar and wind,
p240
aVand ahead of solar \u2014
p241
aVoh, I'm sorry \u2014 with hydro and wind, and ahead of solar.
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd does nuclear really compete with coal?
p244
aVJust ask the coal miners in Australia.
p245
aVThat's where you see some of the source,
p246
aVnot from my fellow environmentalists,
p247
aVbut from people who feel threatened by nuclear power.
p248
aVWell the good news is that
p249
aVthe developing world, but frankly, the whole world,
p250
aVis busy building, and starting to build, nuclear reactors.
p251
aVThis is good for the atmosphere.
p252
aVIt's good for their prosperity.
p253
aa(lp254
VI want to point out one interesting thing,
p255
aVwhich is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower.
p256
aVIt's supposed to be, I don't know, local solar and wind and cogeneration,
p257
aVand good things like that.
p258
aVBut frankly micro-reactors which are just now coming on,
p259
aVmight serve even better.
p260
aa(lp261
VThe Russians, who started this, are building floating reactors,
p262
aVfor their new passage, where the ice is melting, north of Russia.
p263
aVAnd they're selling these floating reactors,
p264
aVonly 35 megawatts, to developing countries.
p265
aVHere's the design of an early one from Toshiba.
p266
aVIt's interesting, say, to take a 25-megawatt,
p267
aV25 million watts,
p268
aVand you compare it to the standard big iron
p269
aVof an ordinary Westinghouse or Ariva,
p270
aVwhich is 1.2, 1.6 billion watts.
p271
aVThese things are way smaller. They're much more adaptable.
p272
aVHere's an American design from Lawrence Livermore Lab.
p273
aVHere's another American design that came out
p274
aVof Los Alamos, and is now commercial.
p275
aa(lp276
VAlmost all of these are not only small, they are proliferation-proof.
p277
aVThey're typically buried in the ground.
p278
aVAnd the innovation is moving very rapidly.
p279
aVSo I think microreactors is going to be important for the future.
p280
aVIn terms of proliferation,
p281
aVnuclear energy has done more
p282
aVto dismantle nuclear weapons than any other activity.
p283
aVAnd that's why 10 percent of the electricity in this room,
p284
aV20 percent of electricity
p285
aVin this room is probably nuclear.
p286
aVHalf of that is coming from dismantled warheads from Russia,
p287
aVsoon to be joined by our dismantled warheads.
p288
aVAnd so I would like to see the GNEP program,
p289
aVthat was developed in the Bush administration, go forward aggressively.
p290
aVAnd I was glad to see that president Obama
p291
aVsupported the nuclear fuel bank strategy
p292
aVwhen he spoke in Prague the other week.
p293
aa(lp294
VOne more subject. Genetically engineered food crops,
p295
aVin my view, as a biologist,
p296
aVhave no reason to be controversial.
p297
aVMy fellow environmentalists, on this subject,
p298
aVhave been irrational, anti-scientific, and very harmful.
p299
aVDespite their best efforts,
p300
aVgenetically engineered crops are the most
p301
aVrapidly successful agricultural innovation in history.
p302
aVThey're good for the environment because they enable no-till farming,
p303
aVwhich leaves the soil in place,
p304
aVgetting healthier from year to year \u2014
p305
aVslso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil
p306
aVinto the atmosphere.
p307
aVThey reduce pesticide use.
p308
aVAnd they increase yield, which allows you to have your
p309
aVagricultural area be smaller,
p310
aVand therefore more wild area is freed up.
p311
aa(lp312
VBy the way, this map from 2006
p313
aVis out of date because it shows Africa
p314
aVstill under the thumb of Greenpeace,
p315
aVand Friends of the Earth from Europe,
p316
aVand they're finally getting out from under that.
p317
aVAnd biotech is moving rapidly in Africa, at last.
p318
aa(lp319
VThis is a moral issue.
p320
aVThe Nuffield Council on Bioethics
p321
aVmet on this issue twice in great detail
p322
aVand said it is a moral imperative
p323
aVto make genetically engineered crops readily available.
p324
aVSpeaking of imperatives, geoengineering is taboo now,
p325
aVespecially in government circles,
p326
aVthough I think there was a DARPA meeting on it a couple of weeks ago,
p327
aVbut it will be on your plate \u2014
p328
aVnot this year but pretty soon,
p329
aVbecause some harsh realizations are coming along.
p330
aVThis is a list of them.
p331
aa(lp332
VBasically the news is going to keep getting more scary.
p333
aVThere will be events,
p334
aVlike 35,000 people dying of a heat wave,
p335
aVwhich happened a while back.
p336
aVLike cyclones coming up toward Bangladesh.
p337
aVLike wars over water,
p338
aVsuch as in the Indus.
p339
aVAnd as those events keep happening
p340
aVwe're going to say, "Okay, what can we do about that really?"
p341
aa(lp342
VBut there's this little problem with geoengineering:
p343
aVwhat body is going to decide
p344
aVwho gets to engineer? How much they do? Where they do it?
p345
aVBecause everybody is downstream,
p346
aVdownwind of whatever is done.
p347
aVAnd if we just taboo it completely
p348
aVwe could lose civilization.
p349
aVBut if we just say "OK,
p350
aVChina, you're worried, you go ahead.
p351
aVYou geoengineer your way. We'll geoengineer our way."
p352
aVThat would be considered an act of war by both nations.
p353
aVSo this is very interesting diplomacy coming along.
p354
aVI should say, it is more practical than people think.
p355
aa(lp356
VHere is an example that climatologists like a lot,
p357
aVone of the dozens of geoengineering ideas.
p358
aVThis one came from the sulfur dioxide
p359
aVfrom Mount Pinatubo in 1991 \u2014
p360
aVcooled the earth by half a degree.
p361
aVThere was so much ice in 1992, the following year,
p362
aVthat there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs
p363
aVwho were known as the Pinatubo cubs.
p364
aVTo put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere
p365
aVwould cost on the order of a billion dollars a year.
p366
aVThat's nothing, compared to all of the other
p367
aVthings we may be trying to do about energy.
p368
aa(lp369
VJust to run by another one:
p370
aVthis is a plan to brighten the reflectance of ocean clouds,
p371
aVby atomizing seawater;
p372
aVthat would brighten the albedo of the whole planet.
p373
aVA nice one, because it can happen
p374
aVlots of little ways in lots of little places,
p375
aVis by copying the ancient Amazon Indians
p376
aVwho made good agricultural soil
p377
aVby pyrolizing, smoldering, plant waste,
p378
aVand biochar fixes large quantities of carbon
p379
aVwhile it's improving the soil.
p380
aa(lp381
VSo here is where we are.
p382
aVNobel Prize-winning climatologist Paul Crutzen
p383
aVcalls our geological era the Anthropocene,
p384
aVthe human-dominated era. We are stuck
p385
aVwith its obligations.
p386
aVIn the Whole Earth Catalog, my first words were,
p387
aV"We are as Gods, and might as well get good at it."
p388
aVThe first words of Whole Earth Discipline
p389
aVare, "We are as Gods, and have to get good at it."
p390
aVThank you.
