VThese dragons from deep time are incredible creatures.
p4
aVThey're bizzarre,
p5
aVthey're beautiful,
p6
aVand there's very little we know about them.
p7
aa(lp8
VThese thoughts were going through my head
p9
aVwhen I looked at the pages of my first dinosaur book.
p10
aVI was about five years old at the time,
p11
aVand I decided there and then
p12
aVthat I would become a paleontologist.
p13
aVPaleontology allowed me  to combine my love for animals
p14
aVwith my desire to travel to  far-flung corners of the world.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd now, a few years later, I've led several expeditions
p17
aVto the ultimate far-flung corner  on this planet, the Sahara.
p18
aVI've worked in the Sahara because I've been on a quest
p19
aVto uncover new remains of a bizarre, giant predatory dinosaur
p20
aVcalled Spinosaurus.
p21
aa(lp22
VA few bones of this animal have been found
p23
aVin the deserts of Egypt
p24
aVand were described about 100 years ago by a German paleontologist.
p25
aVUnfortunately, all his Spinosaurus bones were destroyed in World War II.
p26
aVSo all we're left with are just a few drawings and notes.
p27
aa(lp28
VFrom these drawings,
p29
aVwe know that this creature, which lived  about 100 million years ago,
p30
aVwas very big,
p31
aVit had tall spines on its back, forming a magnificent sail,
p32
aVand it had long, slender jaws,  a bit like a crocodile,
p33
aVwith conical teeth,
p34
aVthat may have been used  to catch slippery prey, like fish.
p35
aVBut that was pretty much  all we knew
p36
aVabout this animal for the next 100 years.
p37
aa(lp38
VMy fieldwork took me to the border region between Morocco and Algeria,
p39
aVa place called the Kem Kem.
p40
aVIt's a difficult place to work in.
p41
aVYou have to deal with sandstorms and snakes and scorpions,
p42
aVand it's very difficult to find good fossils there.
p43
aVBut our hard work paid off.
p44
aVWe discovered many incredible specimens.
p45
aVThere's the largest dinosaur bone
p46
aVthat had ever been found in this part of the Sahara.
p47
aVWe found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs,
p48
aVmedium-sized predatory dinosaurs,
p49
aVand seven or eight different kinds of crocodile-like hunters.
p50
aa(lp51
VThese fossils were deposited in a river system.
p52
aVThe river system was also home  to a giant, car-sized coelacanth,
p53
aVa monster sawfish,
p54
aVand the skies over the river system were filled with pterosaurs,
p55
aVflying reptiles.
p56
aVIt was a pretty dangerous place,
p57
aVnot the kind of place where you'd want to travel to if you had a time machine.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo we're finding all these  incredible fossils of animals
p60
aVthat lived alongside Spinosaurus,
p61
aVbut Spinosaurus itself proved to be very elusive.
p62
aVWe were just finding bits and pieces
p63
aVand I was hoping that we'd find a partial skeleton at some point.
p64
aa(lp65
VFinally, very recently,
p66
aVwe were able to track down a dig site
p67
aVwhere a local fossil hunter found several bones of Spinosaurus.
p68
aVWe returned to the site, we collected more bones.
p69
aVAnd so after 100 years we finally had another partial skeleton
p70
aVof this bizarre creature.
p71
aVAnd we were able to reconstruct it.
p72
aa(lp73
VWe now know that  Spinosaurus had a head
p74
aVa little bit like a crocodile,
p75
aVvery different from other  predatory dinosaurs,
p76
aVvery different from the T. rex.
p77
aVBut the really interesting information came from the rest of the skeleton.
p78
aVWe had long spines,
p79
aVthe spines forming the big sail.
p80
aVWe had leg bones, we had skull bones,
p81
aVwe had paddle-shaped feet, wide feet \u2014
p82
aVagain, very unusual, no other dinosaur has feet like this \u2014
p83
aVand we think they may have been used to walk on soft sediment,
p84
aVor maybe for paddling in the water.
p85
aVWe also looked at the fine microstructure of the bone,
p86
aVthe inside structure of Spinosaurus bones,
p87
aVand it turns out that they're very dense and compact.
p88
aVAgain, this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water,
p89
aVit's useful for buoyancy  control in the water.
p90
aa(lp91
VWe C.T.-scanned all of our bones and built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton.
p92
aVAnd when we looked  at the digital skeleton,
p93
aVwe realized that yes, this was a dinosaur unlike any other.
p94
aVIt's bigger than a T. rex,
p95
aVand yes, the head has "fish-eating" written all over it,
p96
aVbut really the entire skeleton has "water-loving" written all over it \u2014
p97
aVdense bone, paddle-like feet, and the hind limbs are reduced in size,
p98
aVand again, this is something we see in animals
p99
aVthat spend a substantial amount  of time in the water.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo, as we fleshed out our Spinosaurus \u2014
p102
aVI'm looking at muscle attachments and wrapping our dinosaur in skin \u2014
p103
aVwe realize that we're dealing with a river monster,
p104
aVa predatory dinosaur, bigger than T. rex,
p105
aVthe ruler of this ancient river of giants,
p106
aVfeeding on the many aquatic animals I showed you earlier on.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo that's really what makes this an incredible discovery.
p109
aVIt's a dinosaur like no other.
p110
aVAnd some people told me, "Wow, this is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery.
p111
aVThere are not many things left to discover in the world."
p112
aVWell, I think nothing could be  further from the truth.
p113
aVI think the Sahara's  still full of treasures,
p114
aVand when people tell me there are no places left to explore,
p115
aVI like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter, Roy Chapman Andrews,
p116
aVand he said, "Always, there has been an adventure just around the corner \u2014
p117
aVand the world is still full of corners."
p118
aVThat was true many decades ago
p119
aVwhen Roy Chapman Andrews wrote these lines.
p120
aVAnd it is still true today.
p121
aa(lp122
VThank you.
