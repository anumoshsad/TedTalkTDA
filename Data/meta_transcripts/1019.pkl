VI'm here today to share with you
p4
aVan extraordinary journey -
p5
aVextraordinarily rewarding journey, actually -
p6
aVwhich brought me into
p7
aVtraining rats
p8
aVto save human lives
p9
aVby detecting landmines
p10
aVand tuberculosis.
p11
aVAs a child, I had two passions.
p12
aVOne was a passion for rodents.
p13
aVI had all kinds of rats,
p14
aVmice, hamsters,
p15
aVgerbils, squirrels.
p16
aVYou name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aVI also had a passion for Africa.
p19
aVGrowing up in a multicultural environment,
p20
aVwe had African students in the house,
p21
aVand I learned about their stories,
p22
aVso different backgrounds,
p23
aVdependency on imported know-how,
p24
aVgoods, services,
p25
aVexuberant cultural diversity.
p26
aVAfrica was truly fascinating for me.
p27
aa(lp28
VI became an industrial engineer,
p29
aVengineer in product development,
p30
aVand I focused on appropriate detection technologies,
p31
aVactually the first appropriate technologies
p32
aVfor developing countries.
p33
aVI started working in the industry,
p34
aVbut I wasn't really happy to contribute
p35
aVto a material consumer society
p36
aVin a linear, extracting
p37
aVand manufacturing mode.
p38
aVI quit my job to focus on the real world problem:
p39
aVlandmines.
p40
aVWe're talking '95 now.
p41
aVPrincess Diana is announcing on TV
p42
aVthat landmines form a structural barrier
p43
aVto any development, which is really true.
p44
aVAs long as these devices are there,
p45
aVor there is suspicion of landmines,
p46
aVyou can't really enter into the land.
p47
aVActually, there was an appeal worldwide
p48
aVfor new detectors
p49
aVsustainable in the environments
p50
aVwhere they're needed to produce,
p51
aVwhich is mainly in the developing world.
p52
aVWe chose rats.
p53
aa(lp54
VWhy would you choose rats?
p55
aVBecause, aren't they vermin?
p56
aVWell, actually rats are,
p57
aVin contrary to what most people think about them,
p58
aVrats are highly sociable creatures.
p59
aVAnd actually, our product \u2014 what you see here.
p60
aVThere's a target somewhere here.
p61
aVYou see an operator, a trained African
p62
aVwith his rats in front
p63
aVwho actually are left and right.
p64
aVThere, the animal finds a mine.
p65
aVIt scratches on the soil.
p66
aVAnd the animal comes back for a food reward.
p67
aVVery, very simple.
p68
aVVery sustainable in this environment.
p69
aVHere, the animal gets its food reward.
p70
aVAnd that's how it works.
p71
aVVery, very simple.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow why would you use rats?
p74
aVRats have been used since the '50s last century,
p75
aVin all kinds of experiments.
p76
aVRats have more genetic material
p77
aVallocated to olfaction
p78
aVthan any other mammal species.
p79
aVThey're extremely sensitive to smell.
p80
aVMoreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells
p81
aVand to communicate about it.
p82
aVNow how do we communicate with rats?
p83
aVWell don't talk rat,
p84
aVbut we have a clicker,
p85
aVa standard method for animal training,
p86
aVwhich you see there.
p87
aVA clicker, which makes a particular sound
p88
aVwith which you can reinforce particular behaviors.
p89
aVFirst of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward,
p90
aVwhich is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.
p91
aVOnce the animal knows click, food,
p92
aVclick, food, click, food \u2014
p93
aVso click is food \u2014
p94
aVwe bring it in a cage with a hole,
p95
aVand actually the animal learns
p96
aVto stick the nose in the hole
p97
aVunder which a target scent is placed,
p98
aVand to do that for five seconds \u2014
p99
aVfive seconds, which is long for a rat.
p100
aVOnce the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult.
p101
aVIt learns how to find the target smell
p102
aVin a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes.
p103
aa(lp104
VThen the animal learns
p105
aVto walk on a leash in the open
p106
aVand find targets.
p107
aVIn the next step, animals learn
p108
aVto find real mines in real minefields.
p109
aVThey are tested and accredited
p110
aVaccording to International Mine Action Standards,
p111
aVjust like dogs have to pass a test.
p112
aVThis consists of 400 square meters.
p113
aVThere's a number of mines
p114
aVplaced blindly,
p115
aVand the team of trainer and their rat
p116
aVhave to find all the targets.
p117
aVIf the animal does that, it gets a license
p118
aVas an accredited animal
p119
aVto be operational in the field \u2014
p120
aVjust like dogs, by the way.
p121
aVMaybe one slight difference:
p122
aVwe can train rats at a fifth of the price
p123
aVof training the mining dog.
p124
aa(lp125
VThis is our team in Mozambique:
p126
aVone Tanzanian trainer,
p127
aVwho transfers the skills
p128
aVto these three Mozambican fellows.
p129
aVAnd you should see the pride in the eyes of these people.
p130
aVThey have a skill,
p131
aVwhich makes them much less dependent
p132
aVon foreign aid.
p133
aVMoreover, this small team
p134
aVtogether with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles
p135
aVand the manual de-miners to follow-up.
p136
aVBut with this small investment in a rat capacity,
p137
aVwe have demonstrated in Mozambique
p138
aVthat we can reduce the cost-price per square meter
p139
aVup to 60 percent
p140
aVof what is currently normal \u2014
p141
aVtwo dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18,
p142
aVand we can still bring that price down.
p143
aVQuestion of scale.
p144
aVIf you can bring in more rats,
p145
aVwe can actually make the output even bigger.
p146
aVWe have a demonstration site in Mozambique.
p147
aVEleven African governments
p148
aVhave seen that they can become less dependent
p149
aVby using this technology.
p150
aVThey have signed the pact for peace
p151
aVand treaty in the Great Lakes region,
p152
aVand they endorse hero rats
p153
aVto clear their common borders of landmines.
p154
aa(lp155
VBut let me bring you to a very different problem.
p156
aVAnd there's about 6,000 people last year
p157
aVthat walked on a landmine,
p158
aVbut worldwide last year,
p159
aValmost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis
p160
aVas a first cause of infection.
p161
aVEspecially in Africa
p162
aVwhere T.B. and HIV are strongly linked,
p163
aVthere is a huge common problem.
p164
aVMicroscopy, the standard WHO procedure,
p165
aVreaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability.
p166
aVIn Tanzania \u2014 the numbers don't lie \u2014
p167
aV45 percent of people \u2014 T.B. patients \u2014
p168
aVget diagnosed with T.B. before they die.
p169
aVIt means that, if you have T.B.,
p170
aVyou have more chance that you won't be detected,
p171
aVbut will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on.
p172
aVAnd if, however,
p173
aVyou are detected very early, diagnosed early,
p174
aVtreatment can start,
p175
aVand even in HIV-positives, it makes sense.
p176
aVYou can actually cure T.B.,
p177
aVeven in HIV-positives.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo in our common language, Dutch,
p180
aVthe name for T.B.
p181
aVis "tering,"
p182
aVwhich, etymologically,
p183
aVrefers to the smell of tar.
p184
aVAlready the old Chinese
p185
aVand the Greek, Hippocrates,
p186
aVhave actually published,
p187
aVdocumented, that T.B. can be diagnosed
p188
aVbased on the volatiles
p189
aVexuding from patients.
p190
aVSo what we did is we collected some samples \u2014
p191
aVjust as a way of testing \u2014
p192
aVfrom hospitals,
p193
aVtrained rats on them
p194
aVand see if this works,
p195
aVand wonder, well,
p196
aVwe can reach 89 percent sensitivity,
p197
aV86 percent specificity
p198
aVusing multiple rats in a row.
p199
aVThis is how it works,
p200
aVand really, this is a generic technology.
p201
aVWe're talking now explosives, tuberculosis,
p202
aVbut can you imagine,
p203
aVyou can actually put anything under there.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo how does it work?
p206
aVYou have a cassette with 10 samples.
p207
aVYou put these 10 samples at once in the cage.
p208
aVAn animal only needs two hundredths of a second
p209
aVto discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast.
p210
aVHere it's already at the third sample.
p211
aVThis is a positive sample.
p212
aVIt gets a click sound and comes for the food reward.
p213
aVAnd by doing so, very fast,
p214
aVwe can have like a second-line opinion
p215
aVto see which patients are positive,
p216
aVwhich are negative.
p217
aVJust as an indication,
p218
aVwhereas a microscopist can process
p219
aV40 samples in a day,
p220
aVa rat can process
p221
aVthe same amount of samples
p222
aVin seven minutes only.
p223
aVA cage like this \u2014
p224
aV(Applause)
p225
aVA cage like this \u2014 provided that you have rats,
p226
aVand we have now currently
p227
aV25 tuberculosis rats \u2014
p228
aVa cage like this, operating throughout the day,
p229
aVcan process 1,680 samples.
p230
aVCan you imagine the potential offspring applications \u2014
p231
aVenvironmental detection
p232
aVof pollutants in soils,
p233
aVcustoms applications,
p234
aVdetection of illicit goods in containers and so on.
p235
aa(lp236
VBut let's stick first to tuberculosis.
p237
aVI just want to briefly highlight,
p238
aVthe blue rods
p239
aVare the scores of microscopy only
p240
aVat the five clinics in Dar es Salaam
p241
aVon a population of 500,000 people,
p242
aVwhere 15,000 reported to get a test done.
p243
aVMicroscopy for 1,800 patients.
p244
aVAnd by just presenting the samples once more to the rats
p245
aVand looping those results back,
p246
aVwe were able to increase case detection rates
p247
aVby over 30 percent.
p248
aVThroughout last year,
p249
aVwe've been \u2014 depending on which intervals you take \u2014
p250
aVwe've been consistently
p251
aVincreasing case detection rates
p252
aVin five hospitals in Dar es Salaam
p253
aVbetween 30 and 40 percent.
p254
aVSo this is really considerable.
p255
aVKnowing that a missed patient by microscopy
p256
aVinfects up to 15 people,
p257
aVhealthy people, per year,
p258
aVyou can be sure
p259
aVthat we have saved lots of lives.
p260
aVAt least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.
p261
aa(lp262
VThe way forward for us
p263
aVis now to standardize this technology.
p264
aVAnd there are simple things
p265
aVlike, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole
p266
aVwhere the animal has to stick for five seconds.
p267
aVSo, to standardize this.
p268
aVAlso, to standardize the pellets,
p269
aVthe food rewards,
p270
aVand to semi-automate this
p271
aVin order to replicate this on a much larger scale
p272
aVand affect the lives of many more people.
p273
aVTo conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon.
p274
aVHere is a first prototype
p275
aVof our camera rat,
p276
aVwhich is a rat with a rat backpack
p277
aVwith a camera that can go under rubble
p278
aVto detect for victims
p279
aVafter earthquake and so on.
p280
aVThis is in a prototype stage.
p281
aVWe don't have a working system here yet.
p282
aa(lp283
VTo conclude, I would actually like to say,
p284
aVyou may think this is about rats, these projects,
p285
aVbut in the end it is about people.
p286
aVIt is about empowering vulnerable communities
p287
aVto tackle difficult, expensive
p288
aVand dangerous humanitarian detection tasks,
p289
aVand doing that with a local resource,
p290
aVplenty available.
p291
aVSo something completely different
p292
aVis to keep on challenging your perception
p293
aVabout the resources surrounding you,
p294
aVwhether they are environmental,
p295
aVtechnological, animal, or human.
p296
aVAnd to respectfully harmonize with them
p297
aVin order to foster a sustainable world.
p298
aa(lp299
VThank you very much.
