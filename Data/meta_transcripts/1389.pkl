VI have a question for you:
p4
aVAre you religious?
p5
aVPlease raise your hand right now
p6
aVif you think of yourself as a religious person.
p7
aVLet's see, I'd say about three or four percent.
p8
aVI had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aVOkay, here's another question:
p11
aVDo you think of yourself as spiritual
p12
aVin any way, shape or form? Raise your hand.
p13
aVOkay, that's the majority.
p14
aa(lp15
VMy Talk today
p16
aVis about the main reason, or one of the main reasons,
p17
aVwhy most people consider themselves
p18
aVto be spiritual in some way, shape or form.
p19
aVMy Talk today is about self-transcendence.
p20
aVIt's just a basic fact about being human
p21
aVthat sometimes the self seems to just melt away.
p22
aVAnd when that happens,
p23
aVthe feeling is ecstatic
p24
aVand we reach for metaphors of up and down
p25
aVto explain these feelings.
p26
aVWe talk about being uplifted
p27
aVor elevated.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow it's really hard to think about anything abstract like this
p30
aVwithout a good concrete metaphor.
p31
aVSo here's the metaphor I'm offering today.
p32
aVThink about the mind as being like a house with many rooms,
p33
aVmost of which we're very familiar with.
p34
aVBut sometimes it's as though a doorway appears
p35
aVfrom out of nowhere
p36
aVand it opens onto a staircase.
p37
aVWe climb the staircase
p38
aVand experience a state of altered consciousness.
p39
aa(lp40
VIn 1902,
p41
aVthe great American psychologist William James
p42
aVwrote about the many varieties of religious experience.
p43
aVHe collected all kinds of case studies.
p44
aVHe quoted the words of all kinds of people
p45
aVwho'd had a variety of these experiences.
p46
aVOne of the most exciting to me
p47
aVis this young man, Stephen Bradley,
p48
aVhad an encounter, he thought, with Jesus in 1820.
p49
aVAnd here's what Bradley said about it.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Music)
p52
aa(lp53
V(Video) Stephen Bradley: I thought I saw the savior in human shape
p54
aVfor about one second in the room,
p55
aVwith arms extended,
p56
aVappearing to say to me, "Come."
p57
aVThe next day I rejoiced with trembling.
p58
aVMy happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die.
p59
aVThis world had no place in my affections.
p60
aVPrevious to this time,
p61
aVI was very selfish and self-righteous.
p62
aVBut now I desired the welfare of all mankind
p63
aVand could, with a feeling heart,
p64
aVforgive my worst enemies.
p65
aa(lp66
VJH: So note
p67
aVhow Bradley's petty, moralistic self
p68
aVjust dies on the way up the staircase.
p69
aVAnd on this higher level
p70
aVhe becomes loving and forgiving.
p71
aVThe world's many religions have found so many ways
p72
aVto help people climb the staircase.
p73
aVSome shut down the self using meditation.
p74
aVOthers use psychedelic drugs.
p75
aVThis is from a 16th century Aztec scroll
p76
aVshowing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom
p77
aVand at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god.
p78
aVOthers use dancing, spinning and circling
p79
aVto promote self-transcendence.
p80
aVBut you don't need a religion to get you through the staircase.
p81
aVLots of people find self-transcendence in nature.
p82
aVOthers overcome their self at raves.
p83
aa(lp84
VBut here's the weirdest place of all:
p85
aVwar.
p86
aVSo many books about war say the same thing,
p87
aVthat nothing brings people together
p88
aVlike war.
p89
aVAnd that bringing them together opens up the possibility
p90
aVof extraordinary self-transcendent experiences.
p91
aVI'm going to play for you an excerpt
p92
aVfrom this book by Glenn Gray.
p93
aVGray was a soldier in the American army in World War II.
p94
aVAnd after the war he interviewed a lot of other soldiers
p95
aVand wrote about the experience of men in battle.
p96
aVHere's a key passage
p97
aVwhere he basically describes the staircase.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Video) Glenn Gray: Many veterans will admit
p100
aVthat the experience of communal effort in battle
p101
aVhas been the high point of their lives.
p102
aV"I" passes insensibly into a "we,"
p103
aV"my" becomes "our"
p104
aVand individual faith
p105
aVloses its central importance.
p106
aVI believe that it is nothing less
p107
aVthan the assurance of immortality
p108
aVthat makes self-sacrifice at these moments
p109
aVso relatively easy.
p110
aVI may fall, but I do not die,
p111
aVfor that which is real in me goes forward
p112
aVand lives on in the comrades
p113
aVfor whom I gave up my life.
p114
aa(lp115
VJH: So what all of these cases have in common
p116
aVis that the self seems to thin out, or melt away,
p117
aVand it feels good, it feels really good,
p118
aVin a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives.
p119
aVIt feels somehow uplifting.
p120
aVThis idea that we move up was central in the writing
p121
aVof the great French sociologist Emile Durkheim.
p122
aVDurkheim even called us Homo duplex,
p123
aVor two-level man.
p124
aVThe lower level he called the level of the profane.
p125
aVNow profane is the opposite of sacred.
p126
aVIt just means ordinary or common.
p127
aVAnd in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals.
p128
aVWe want to satisfy our individual desires.
p129
aVWe pursue our individual goals.
p130
aVBut sometimes something happens
p131
aVthat triggers a phase change.
p132
aVIndividuals unite
p133
aVinto a team, a movement or a nation,
p134
aVwhich is far more than the sum of its parts.
p135
aa(lp136
VDurkheim called this level the level of the sacred
p137
aVbecause he believed that the function of religion
p138
aVwas to unite people into a group,
p139
aVinto a moral community.
p140
aVDurkheim believed that anything that unites us
p141
aVtakes on an air of sacredness.
p142
aVAnd once people circle around
p143
aVsome sacred object or value,
p144
aVthey'll then work as a team and fight to defend it.
p145
aVDurkheim wrote
p146
aVabout a set of intense collective emotions
p147
aVthat accomplish this miracle of E pluribus unum,
p148
aVof making a group out of individuals.
p149
aVThink of the collective joy in Britain
p150
aVon the day World War II ended.
p151
aVThink of the collective anger in Tahrir Square,
p152
aVwhich brought down a dictator.
p153
aVAnd think of the collective grief
p154
aVin the United States
p155
aVthat we all felt, that brought us all together,
p156
aVafter 9/11.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo let me summarize where we are.
p159
aVI'm saying that the capacity for self-transcendence
p160
aVis just a basic part of being human.
p161
aVI'm offering the metaphor
p162
aVof a staircase in the mind.
p163
aVI'm saying we are Homo duplex
p164
aVand this staircase takes us up from the profane level
p165
aVto the level of the sacred.
p166
aVWhen we climb that staircase,
p167
aVself-interest fades away,
p168
aVwe become just much less self-interested,
p169
aVand we feel as though we are better, nobler
p170
aVand somehow uplifted.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo here's the million-dollar question
p173
aVfor social scientists like me:
p174
aVIs the staircase
p175
aVa feature of our evolutionary design?
p176
aVIs it a product of natural selection,
p177
aVlike our hands?
p178
aVOr is it a bug, a mistake in the system \u2014
p179
aVthis religious stuff is just something
p180
aVthat happens when the wires cross in the brain \u2014
p181
aVJill has a stroke and she has this religious experience,
p182
aVit's just a mistake?
p183
aa(lp184
VWell many scientists who study religion take this view.
p185
aVThe New Atheists, for example,
p186
aVargue that religion is a set of memes,
p187
aVsort of parasitic memes,
p188
aVthat get inside our minds
p189
aVand make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff,
p190
aVself-destructive stuff, like suicide bombing.
p191
aVAnd after all,
p192
aVhow could it ever be good for us
p193
aVto lose ourselves?
p194
aVHow could it ever be adaptive
p195
aVfor any organism
p196
aVto overcome self-interest?
p197
aVWell let me show you.
p198
aa(lp199
VIn "The Descent of Man,"
p200
aVCharles Darwin wrote a great deal
p201
aVabout the evolution of morality \u2014
p202
aVwhere did it come from, why do we have it.
p203
aVDarwin noted that many of our virtues
p204
aVare of very little use to ourselves,
p205
aVbut they're of great use to our groups.
p206
aVHe wrote about the scenario
p207
aVin which two tribes of early humans
p208
aVwould have come in contact and competition.
p209
aVHe said, "If the one tribe included
p210
aVa great number of courageous, sympathetic
p211
aVand faithful members
p212
aVwho are always ready to aid and defend each other,
p213
aVthis tribe would succeed better
p214
aVand conquer the other."
p215
aVHe went on to say that "Selfish and contentious people
p216
aVwill not cohere,
p217
aVand without coherence
p218
aVnothing can be effected."
p219
aVIn other words,
p220
aVCharles Darwin believed
p221
aVin group selection.
p222
aa(lp223
VNow this idea has been very controversial for the last 40 years,
p224
aVbut it's about to make a major comeback this year,
p225
aVespecially after E.O. Wilson's book comes out in April,
p226
aVmaking a very strong case
p227
aVthat we, and several other species,
p228
aVare products of group selection.
p229
aVBut really the way to think about this
p230
aVis as multilevel selection.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo look at it this way:
p233
aVYou've got competition going on within groups and across groups.
p234
aVSo here's a group of guys on a college crew team.
p235
aVWithin this team
p236
aVthere's competition.
p237
aVThere are guys competing with each other.
p238
aVThe slowest rowers, the weakest rowers, are going to get cut from the team.
p239
aVAnd only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport.
p240
aVMaybe one of them will make it to the Olympics.
p241
aVSo within the team,
p242
aVtheir interests are actually pitted against each other.
p243
aVAnd sometimes it would be advantageous
p244
aVfor one of these guys
p245
aVto try to sabotage the other guys.
p246
aVMaybe he'll badmouth his chief rival
p247
aVto the coach.
p248
aVBut while that competition is going on
p249
aVwithin the boat,
p250
aVthis competition is going on across boats.
p251
aVAnd once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat,
p252
aVnow they've got no choice but to cooperate
p253
aVbecause they're all in the same boat.
p254
aVThey can only win
p255
aVif they all pull together as a team.
p256
aVI mean, these things sound trite,
p257
aVbut they are deep evolutionary truths.
p258
aa(lp259
VThe main argument against group selection
p260
aVhas always been
p261
aVthat, well sure, it would be nice to have a group of cooperators,
p262
aVbut as soon as you have a group of cooperators,
p263
aVthey're just going to get taken over by free-riders,
p264
aVindividuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others.
p265
aVLet me illustrate this for you.
p266
aVSuppose we've got a group of little organisms \u2014
p267
aVthey can be bacteria, they can be hamsters; it doesn't matter what \u2014
p268
aVand let's suppose that this little group here, they evolved to be cooperative.
p269
aVWell that's great. They graze, they defend each other,
p270
aVthey work together, they generate wealth.
p271
aVAnd as you'll see in this simulation,
p272
aVas they interact they gain points, as it were, they grow,
p273
aVand when they've doubled in size, you'll see them split,
p274
aVand that's how they reproduce and the population grows.
p275
aa(lp276
VBut suppose then that one of them mutates.
p277
aVThere's a mutation in the gene
p278
aVand one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy.
p279
aVIt takes advantage of the others.
p280
aVAnd so when a green interacts with a blue,
p281
aVyou'll see the green gets larger and the blue gets smaller.
p282
aVSo here's how things play out.
p283
aVWe start with just one green,
p284
aVand as it interacts
p285
aVit gains wealth or points or food.
p286
aVAnd in short order, the cooperators are done for.
p287
aVThe free-riders have taken over.
p288
aVIf a group cannot solve the free-rider problem
p289
aVthen it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation
p290
aVand group selection cannot get started.
p291
aa(lp292
VBut there are solutions to the free-rider problem.
p293
aVIt's not that hard a problem.
p294
aVIn fact, nature has solved it many, many times.
p295
aVAnd nature's favorite solution
p296
aVis to put everyone in the same boat.
p297
aVFor example,
p298
aVwhy is it that the mitochondria in every cell
p299
aVhas its own DNA,
p300
aVtotally separate from the DNA in the nucleus?
p301
aVIt's because they used to be
p302
aVseparate free-living bacteria
p303
aVand they came together
p304
aVand became a superorganism.
p305
aVSomehow or other \u2014 maybe one swallowed another; we'll never know exactly why \u2014
p306
aVbut once they got a membrane around them,
p307
aVthey were all in the same membrane,
p308
aVnow all the wealth-created division of labor,
p309
aVall the greatness created by cooperation,
p310
aVstays locked inside the membrane
p311
aVand we've got a superorganism.
p312
aa(lp313
VAnd now let's rerun the simulation
p314
aVputting one of these superorganisms
p315
aVinto a population of free-riders, of defectors, of cheaters
p316
aVand look what happens.
p317
aVA superorganism can basically take what it wants.
p318
aVIt's so big and powerful and efficient
p319
aVthat it can take resources
p320
aVfrom the greens, from the defectors, the cheaters.
p321
aVAnd pretty soon the whole population
p322
aVis actually composed of these new superorganisms.
p323
aVWhat I've shown you here
p324
aVis sometimes called a major transition
p325
aVin evolutionary history.
p326
aVDarwin's laws don't change,
p327
aVbut now there's a new kind of player on the field
p328
aVand things begin to look very different.
p329
aa(lp330
VNow this transition was not a one-time freak of nature
p331
aVthat just happened with some bacteria.
p332
aVIt happened again
p333
aVabout 120 or a 140 million years ago
p334
aVwhen some solitary wasps
p335
aVbegan creating little simple, primitive
p336
aVnests, or hives.
p337
aVOnce several wasps were all together in the same hive,
p338
aVthey had no choice but to cooperate,
p339
aVbecause pretty soon they were locked into competition
p340
aVwith other hives.
p341
aVAnd the most cohesive hives won,
p342
aVjust as Darwin said.
p343
aa(lp344
VThese early wasps
p345
aVgave rise to the bees and the ants
p346
aVthat have covered the world
p347
aVand changed the biosphere.
p348
aVAnd it happened again,
p349
aVeven more spectacularly,
p350
aVin the last half-million years
p351
aVwhen our own ancestors
p352
aVbecame cultural creatures,
p353
aVthey came together around a hearth or a campfire,
p354
aVthey divided labor,
p355
aVthey began painting their bodies, they spoke their own dialects,
p356
aVand eventually they worshiped their own gods.
p357
aVOnce they were all in the same tribe,
p358
aVthey could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside.
p359
aVAnd they unlocked the most powerful force
p360
aVever known on this planet,
p361
aVwhich is human cooperation \u2014
p362
aVa force for construction
p363
aVand destruction.
p364
aa(lp365
VOf course, human groups are nowhere near as cohesive
p366
aVas beehives.
p367
aVHuman groups may look like hives for brief moments,
p368
aVbut they tend to then break apart.
p369
aVWe're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are.
p370
aVIn fact, often,
p371
aVas we've seen happen in a lot of the Arab Spring revolts,
p372
aVoften those divisions are along religious lines.
p373
aVNonetheless, when people do come together
p374
aVand put themselves all into the same movement,
p375
aVthey can move mountains.
p376
aa(lp377
VLook at the people in these photos I've been showing you.
p378
aVDo you think they're there
p379
aVpursuing their self-interest?
p380
aVOr are they pursuing communal interest,
p381
aVwhich requires them to lose themselves
p382
aVand become simply a part of a whole?
p383
aa(lp384
VOkay, so that was my Talk
p385
aVdelivered in the standard TED way.
p386
aVAnd now I'm going to give the whole Talk over again
p387
aVin three minutes
p388
aVin a more full-spectrum sort of way.
p389
aa(lp390
V(Music)
p391
aa(lp392
V(Video) Jonathan Haidt: We humans have many varieties
p393
aVof religious experience,
p394
aVas William James explained.
p395
aVOne of the most common is climbing the secret staircase
p396
aVand losing ourselves.
p397
aVThe staircase takes us
p398
aVfrom the experience of life as profane or ordinary
p399
aVupwards to the experience of life as sacred,
p400
aVor deeply interconnected.
p401
aVWe are Homo duplex,
p402
aVas Durkheim explained.
p403
aVAnd we are Homo duplex
p404
aVbecause we evolved by multilevel selection,
p405
aVas Darwin explained.
p406
aVI can't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation
p407
aVrather than a bug,
p408
aVbut if it is an adaptation,
p409
aVthen the implications are profound.
p410
aVIf it is an adaptation,
p411
aVthen we evolved to be religious.
p412
aa(lp413
VI don't mean that we evolved
p414
aVto join gigantic organized religions.
p415
aVThose things came along too recently.
p416
aVI mean that we evolved
p417
aVto see sacredness all around us
p418
aVand to join with others into teams
p419
aVand circle around sacred objects,
p420
aVpeople and ideas.
p421
aVThis is why politics is so tribal.
p422
aVPolitics is partly profane, it's partly about self-interest,
p423
aVbut politics is also about sacredness.
p424
aVIt's about joining with others
p425
aVto pursue moral ideas.
p426
aVIt's about the eternal struggle between good and evil,
p427
aVand we all believe we're on the good team.
p428
aa(lp429
VAnd most importantly,
p430
aVif the staircase is real,
p431
aVit explains the persistent undercurrent
p432
aVof dissatisfaction in modern life.
p433
aVBecause human beings are, to some extent,
p434
aVhivish creatures like bees.
p435
aVWe're bees. We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment.
p436
aVWe broke down the old institutions
p437
aVand brought liberty to the oppressed.
p438
aVWe unleashed Earth-changing creativity
p439
aVand generated vast wealth and comfort.
p440
aa(lp441
VNowadays we fly around
p442
aVlike individual bees exulting in our freedom.
p443
aVBut sometimes we wonder:
p444
aVIs this all there is?
p445
aVWhat should I do with my life?
p446
aVWhat's missing?
p447
aVWhat's missing is that we are Homo duplex,
p448
aVbut modern, secular society was built
p449
aVto satisfy our lower, profane selves.
p450
aVIt's really comfortable down here on the lower level.
p451
aVCome, have a seat in my home entertainment center.
p452
aa(lp453
VOne great challenge of modern life
p454
aVis to find the staircase amid all the clutter
p455
aVand then to do something good and noble
p456
aVonce you climb to the top.
p457
aVI see this desire in my students at the University of Virginia.
p458
aVThey all want to find a cause or calling
p459
aVthat they can throw themselves into.
p460
aVThey're all searching for their staircase.
p461
aVAnd that gives me hope
p462
aVbecause people are not purely selfish.
p463
aa(lp464
VMost people long to overcome pettiness
p465
aVand become part of something larger.
p466
aVAnd this explains the extraordinary resonance
p467
aVof this simple metaphor
p468
aVconjured up nearly 400 years ago.
p469
aV"No man is an island
p470
aVentire of itself.
p471
aVEvery man is a piece of the continent,
p472
aVa part of the main."
