VHave you ever asked yourselves why it is that
p4
aVcompanies, the really cool companies,
p5
aVthe innovative ones, the creative,
p6
aVnew economy-type companies \u2014
p7
aVApple, Google, Facebook \u2014
p8
aVare coming out of one particular country,
p9
aVthe United States of America?
p10
aVUsually when I say this, someone says, "Spotify!
p11
aVThat's Europe." But, yeah.
p12
aVIt has not had the impact that these other companies have had.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow what I do is I'm an economist,
p15
aVand I actually study the relationship
p16
aVbetween innovation and economic growth
p17
aVat the level of the company, the industry and the nation,
p18
aVand I work with policymakers worldwide,
p19
aVespecially in the European Commission,
p20
aVbut recently also in interesting places like China,
p21
aVand I can tell you that that question
p22
aVis on the tip of all of their tongues:
p23
aVWhere are the European Googles?
p24
aVWhat is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model,
p25
aVwhich they understand is different
p26
aVfrom this old economy growth model?
p27
aVAnd what is interesting is that often,
p28
aVeven if we're in the 21st century,
p29
aVwe kind of come down in the end to these ideas
p30
aVof market versus state.
p31
aVIt's talked about in these modern ways,
p32
aVbut the idea is that somehow, behind places like Silicon Valley,
p33
aVthe secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms,
p34
aVthe private initiative, whether this be about
p35
aVa dynamic venture capital sector
p36
aVthat's actually able to provide that high-risk finance
p37
aVto these innovative companies,
p38
aVthe gazelles as we often call them,
p39
aVwhich traditional banks are scared of,
p40
aVor different types of really successful
p41
aVcommercialization policies which actually allow these companies
p42
aVto bring these great inventions, their products,
p43
aVto the market and actually get over this
p44
aVreally scary Death Valley period
p45
aVin which many companies instead fail.
p46
aa(lp47
VBut what really interests me, especially nowadays
p48
aVand because of what's happening politically around the world,
p49
aVis the language that's used, the narrative,
p50
aVthe discourse, the images, the actual words.
p51
aVSo we often are presented
p52
aVwith the kind of words like that the private sector
p53
aVis also much more innovative because it's able to
p54
aVthink out of the box.
p55
aVThey are more dynamic.
p56
aVThink of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech
p57
aVto the 2005 graduating class at Stanford,
p58
aVwhere he said to be innovative,
p59
aVyou've got to stay hungry, stay foolish.
p60
aVRight? So these guys are kind of the hungry
p61
aVand foolish and colorful guys, right?
p62
aVAnd in places like Europe,
p63
aVit might be more equitable,
p64
aVwe might even be a bit better dressed
p65
aVand eat better than the U.S.,
p66
aVbut the problem is this damn public sector.
p67
aVIt's a bit too big, and it hasn't actually allowed
p68
aVthese things like dynamic venture capital
p69
aVand commercialization to actually be able to really
p70
aVbe as fruitful as it could.
p71
aVAnd even really respectable newspapers,
p72
aVsome that I'm actually subscribed to,
p73
aVthe words they use are, you know,
p74
aVthe state as this Leviathan. Right?
p75
aVThis monster with big tentacles.
p76
aVThey're very explicit in these editorials.
p77
aVThey say, "You know, the state, it's necessary
p78
aVto fix these little market failures
p79
aVwhen you have public goods
p80
aVor different types of negative externalities like pollution,
p81
aVbut you know what, what is the next big revolution
p82
aVgoing to be after the Internet?
p83
aVWe all hope it might be something green,
p84
aVor all of this nanotech stuff, and in order for that stuff to happen," they say \u2014
p85
aVthis was a special issue on the next industrial revolution \u2014
p86
aVthey say, "the state, just stick to the basics, right?
p87
aVFund the infrastructure. Fund the schools.
p88
aVEven fund the basic research, because this is
p89
aVpopularly recognized, in fact, as a big public good
p90
aVwhich private companies don't want to invest in,
p91
aVdo that, but you know what?
p92
aVLeave the rest to the revolutionaries."
p93
aVThose colorful, out-of-the-box kind of thinkers.
p94
aVThey're often called garage tinkerers,
p95
aVbecause some of them actually did some things in garages,
p96
aVeven though that's partly a myth.
p97
aVAnd so what I want to do with you in, oh God,
p98
aVonly 10 minutes,
p99
aVis to really think again this juxtaposition,
p100
aVbecause it actually has massive, massive implications
p101
aVbeyond innovation policy,
p102
aVwhich just happens to be the area
p103
aVthat I often talk with with policymakers.
p104
aVIt has huge implications, even with this whole notion
p105
aVthat we have on where, when and why
p106
aVwe should actually be cutting back on public spending
p107
aVand different types of public services which,
p108
aVof course, as we know, are increasingly being
p109
aVoutsourced because of this juxtaposition.
p110
aVRight? I mean, the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools
p111
aVis in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened
p112
aVby this heavy hand of the state curriculum, or something.
p113
aVSo these kind of words are constantly,
p114
aVthese juxtapositions come up everywhere,
p115
aVnot just with innovation policy.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd so to think again,
p118
aVthere's no reason that you should believe me,
p119
aVso just think of some of the smartest
p120
aVrevolutionary things that you have in your pockets
p121
aVand do not turn it on, but you might want to take it out, your iPhone.
p122
aVAsk who actually funded the really cool,
p123
aVrevolutionary thinking-out-of-the-box
p124
aVthings in the iPhone.
p125
aVWhat actually makes your phone
p126
aVa smartphone, basically, instead of a stupid phone?
p127
aVSo the Internet, which you can surf the web
p128
aVanywhere you are in the world;
p129
aVGPS, where you can actually know where you are
p130
aVanywhere in the world;
p131
aVthe touchscreen display, which makes it also
p132
aVa really easy-to-use phone for anybody.
p133
aVThese are the very smart, revolutionary bits about the iPhone,
p134
aVand they're all government-funded.
p135
aVAnd the point is that the Internet
p136
aVwas funded by DARPA, U.S. Department of Defense.
p137
aVGPS was funded by the military's Navstar program.
p138
aVEven Siri was actually funded by DARPA.
p139
aVThe touchscreen display was funded
p140
aVby two public grants by the CIA and the NSF
p141
aVto two public university researchers at the University of Delaware.
p142
aVNow, you might be thinking, "Well, she's just said
p143
aVthe word 'defense' and 'military' an awful lot,"
p144
aVbut what's really interesting is that this is actually true
p145
aVin sector after sector and department after department.
p146
aVSo the pharmaceutical industry, which I am personally
p147
aVvery interested in because I've actually had the fortune
p148
aVto study it in quite some depth,
p149
aVis wonderful to be asking this question
p150
aVabout the revolutionary versus non-revolutionary bits,
p151
aVbecause each and every medicine can actually be
p152
aVdivided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental.
p153
aVSo the new molecular entities with priority rating
p154
aVare the revolutionary new drugs,
p155
aVwhereas the slight variations of existing drugs \u2014
p156
aVViagra, different color, different dosage \u2014
p157
aVare the less revolutionary ones.
p158
aVAnd it turns out that a full 75 percent
p159
aVof the new molecular entities with priority rating
p160
aVare actually funded in boring, Kafka-ian public sector labs.
p161
aVThis doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation.
p162
aVThey do. They spend on the marketing part.
p163
aVThey spend on the D part of R&D.
p164
aVThey spend an awful lot on buying back their stock,
p165
aVwhich is quite problematic.
p166
aVIn fact, companies like Pfizer and Amgen recently
p167
aVhave spent more money in buying back their shares
p168
aVto boost their stock price than on R&D,
p169
aVbut that's a whole different TED Talk which one day
p170
aVI'd be fascinated to tell you about.
p171
aa(lp172
VNow, what's interesting in all of this
p173
aVis the state, in all these examples,
p174
aVwas doing so much more than just fixing market failures.
p175
aVIt was actually shaping and creating markets.
p176
aVIt was funding not only the basic research,
p177
aVwhich again is a typical public good,
p178
aVbut even the applied research.
p179
aVIt was even, God forbid, being a venture capitalist.
p180
aVSo these SBIR and SDTR programs,
p181
aVwhich give small companies early-stage finance
p182
aVhave not only been extremely important
p183
aVcompared to private venture capital,
p184
aVbut also have become increasingly important.
p185
aVWhy? Because, as many of us know,
p186
aVV.C. is actually quite short-term.
p187
aVThey want their returns in three to five years.
p188
aVInnovation takes a much longer time than that,
p189
aV15 to 20 years.
p190
aVAnd so this whole notion \u2014 I mean, this is the point, right?
p191
aVWho's actually funding the hard stuff?
p192
aVOf course, it's not just the state.
p193
aVThe private sector does a lot.
p194
aVBut the narrative that we've always been told
p195
aVis the state is important for the basics,
p196
aVbut not really providing that sort of high-risk,
p197
aVrevolutionary thinking out of the box.
p198
aVIn all these sectors, from funding the Internet
p199
aVto doing the spending, but also the envisioning,
p200
aVthe strategic vision, for these investments,
p201
aVit was actually coming within the state.
p202
aVThe nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating
p203
aVto study this, because the word itself, nanotechnology,
p204
aVcame from within government.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd so there's huge implications of this.
p207
aVFirst of all, of course I'm not someone,
p208
aVthis old-fashioned person, market versus state.
p209
aVWhat we all know in dynamic capitalism
p210
aVis that what we actually need are public-private partnerships.
p211
aVBut the point is, by constantly depicting
p212
aVthe state part as necessary
p213
aVbut actually \u2014 pffff \u2014 a bit boring
p214
aVand often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan,
p215
aVI think we've actually really stunted the possibility
p216
aVto build these public-private partnerships
p217
aVin a really dynamic way.
p218
aVEven the words that we often use to justify the "P" part,
p219
aVthe public part \u2014 well, they're both P's \u2014
p220
aVwith public-private partnerships
p221
aVis in terms of de-risking.
p222
aVWhat the public sector did in all these examples
p223
aVI just gave you, and there's many more,
p224
aVwhich myself and other colleagues have been looking at,
p225
aVis doing much more than de-risking.
p226
aVIt's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on.
p227
aVIt's actually been the one thinking out of the box.
p228
aVBut also, I'm sure you all have had experience
p229
aVwith local, regional, national governments,
p230
aVand you're kind of like, "You know what, that Kafka-ian bureaucrat, I've met him."
p231
aVThat whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there.
p232
aVWell, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
p233
aVBy talking about the state as kind of irrelevant,
p234
aVboring, it's sometimes
p235
aVthat we actually create those organizations in that way.
p236
aVSo what we have to actually do is build
p237
aVthese entrepreneurial state organizations.
p238
aVDARPA, that funded the Internet and Siri,
p239
aVactually thought really hard about this,
p240
aVhow to welcome failure, because you will fail.
p241
aVYou will fail when you innovative.
p242
aVOne out of 10 experiments has any success.
p243
aVAnd the V.C. guys know this,
p244
aVand they're able to actually fund the other losses
p245
aVfrom that one success.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd this brings me, actually, probably,
p248
aVto the biggest implication,
p249
aVand this has huge implications beyond innovation.
p250
aVIf the state is more than just a market fixer,
p251
aVif it actually is a market shaper,
p252
aVand in doing that has had to take on this massive risk,
p253
aVwhat happened to the reward?
p254
aVWe all know, if you've ever taken a finance course,
p255
aVthe first thing you're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship,
p256
aVand so some people are foolish enough
p257
aVor probably smart enough if they have time to wait,
p258
aVto actually invest in stocks, because they're higher risk
p259
aVwhich over time will make a greater reward than bonds,
p260
aVthat whole risk-reward thing.
p261
aVWell, where's the reward for the state
p262
aVof having taken on these massive risks
p263
aVand actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet?
p264
aVThe Internet was crazy.
p265
aVIt really was. I mean, the probability of failure was massive.
p266
aVYou had to be completely nuts to do it,
p267
aVand luckily, they were.
p268
aVNow, we don't even get to this question about rewards
p269
aVunless you actually depict the state as this risk-taker.
p270
aVAnd the problem is that economists often think,
p271
aVwell, there is a reward back to the state. It's tax.
p272
aVYou know, the companies will pay tax,
p273
aVthe jobs they create will create growth
p274
aVso people who get those jobs and their incomes rise
p275
aVwill come back to the state through the tax mechanism.
p276
aVWell, unfortunately, that's not true.
p277
aVOkay, it's not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad.
p278
aVGlobalization, and that's fine. We shouldn't be nationalistic.
p279
aVLet the jobs go where they have to go, perhaps.
p280
aVI mean, one can take a position on that.
p281
aVBut also these companies
p282
aVthat have actually had this massive benefit from the state \u2014
p283
aVApple's a great example.
p284
aVThey even got the first \u2014 well, not the first,
p285
aVbut 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple, the company,
p286
aVthrough this SBIC program,
p287
aVwhich predated the SBIR program,
p288
aVas well as, as I said before, all the technologies behind the iPhone.
p289
aVAnd yet we know they legally,
p290
aVas many other companies, pay very little tax back.
p291
aa(lp292
VSo what we really need to actually rethink
p293
aVis should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanism
p294
aVthat's much more direct than tax. Why not?
p295
aVIt could happen perhaps through equity.
p296
aVThis, by the way, in the countries
p297
aVthat are actually thinking about this strategically,
p298
aVcountries like Finland in Scandinavia,
p299
aVbut also in China and Brazil,
p300
aVthey're retaining equity in these investments.
p301
aVSitra funded Nokia, kept equity, made a lot of money,
p302
aVit's a public funding agency in Finland,
p303
aVwhich then funded the next round of Nokias.
p304
aVThe Brazilian Development Bank,
p305
aVwhich is providing huge amounts of funds today
p306
aVto clean technology, they just announced
p307
aVa $56 billion program for the future on this,
p308
aVis retaining equity in these investments.
p309
aVSo to put it provocatively,
p310
aVhad the U.S. government thought about this,
p311
aVand maybe just brought back
p312
aVjust something called an innovation fund,
p313
aVyou can bet that, you know, if even just .05 percent
p314
aVof the profits from what the Internet produced
p315
aVhad come back to that innovation fund,
p316
aVthere would be so much more money
p317
aVto spend today on green technology.
p318
aVInstead, many of the state budgets
p319
aVwhich in theory are trying to do that
p320
aVare being constrained.
p321
aVBut perhaps even more important,
p322
aVwe heard before about the one percent,
p323
aVthe 99 percent.
p324
aVIf the state is thought about in this more strategic way,
p325
aVas one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism,
p326
aVbecause that's what we're talking about, right?
p327
aVWho are the different players in creating value
p328
aVin the economy, and is the state's role,
p329
aVhas it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player?
p330
aVIf we can actually have a broader theory
p331
aVof value creation and allow us to actually admit
p332
aVwhat the state has been doing and reap something back,
p333
aVit might just be that in the next round,
p334
aVand I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution
p335
aVwill in fact be green,
p336
aVthat that period of growth
p337
aVwill not only be smart, innovation-led,
p338
aVnot only green, but also more inclusive,
p339
aVso that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley
p340
aVcan actually also benefit from that growth,
p341
aVbecause they have not.
p342
