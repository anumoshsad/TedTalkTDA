VSo when you look out at the stars at night,
p4
aVit's amazing what you can see.
p5
aVIt's beautiful.
p6
aVBut what's more amazing is what you can't see,
p7
aVbecause what we know now
p8
aVis that around every star or almost every star,
p9
aVthere's a planet,
p10
aVor probably a few.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo what this picture isn't showing you
p13
aVare all the planets that we know about
p14
aVout there in space.
p15
aVBut when we think about planets, we tend to think of faraway things
p16
aVthat are very different from our own.
p17
aVBut here we are on a planet,
p18
aVand there are so many things that are amazing about Earth
p19
aVthat we're searching far and wide to find things that are like that.
p20
aVAnd when we're searching, we're finding amazing things.
p21
aVBut I want to tell you about an amazing thing here on Earth.
p22
aVAnd that is that every minute,
p23
aV400 pounds of hydrogen
p24
aVand almost seven pounds of helium
p25
aVescape from Earth into space.
p26
aVAnd this is gas that is going off and never coming back.
p27
aVSo hydrogen, helium and many other things
p28
aVmake up what's known as the Earth's atmosphere.
p29
aVThe atmosphere is just these gases that form a thin blue line
p30
aVthat's seen here from the International Space Station,
p31
aVa photograph that some astronauts took.
p32
aVAnd this tenuous veneer around our planet
p33
aVis what allows life to flourish.
p34
aVIt protects our planet from too many impacts,
p35
aVfrom meteorites and the like.
p36
aVAnd it's such an amazing phenomenon
p37
aVthat the fact that it's disappearing
p38
aVshould frighten you, at least a little bit.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo this process is something that I study
p41
aVand it's called atmospheric escape.
p42
aVSo atmospheric escape is not specific to planet Earth.
p43
aVIt's part of what it means to be a planet, if you ask me,
p44
aVbecause planets, not just here on Earth but throughout the universe,
p45
aVcan undergo atmospheric escape.
p46
aVAnd the way it happens actually tells us about planets themselves.
p47
aVBecause when you think about the solar system,
p48
aVyou might think about this picture here.
p49
aVAnd you would say, well, there are eight planets, maybe nine.
p50
aVSo for those of you who are stressed by this picture,
p51
aVI will add somebody for you.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VCourtesy of New Horizons, we're including Pluto.
p56
aVAnd the thing here is,
p57
aVfor the purposes of this talk and atmospheric escape,
p58
aVPluto is a planet in my mind,
p59
aVin the same way that planets around other stars that we can't see
p60
aVare also planets.
p61
aVSo fundamental characteristics of planets
p62
aVinclude the fact that they are bodies
p63
aVthat are bound together by gravity.
p64
aVSo it's a lot of material just stuck together
p65
aVwith this attractive force.
p66
aVAnd these bodies are so big and have so much gravity.
p67
aVThat's why they're round.
p68
aVSo when you look at all of these,
p69
aVincluding Pluto,
p70
aVthey're round.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo you can see that gravity is really at play here.
p73
aVBut another fundamental characteristic about planets
p74
aVis what you don't see here,
p75
aVand that's the star, the Sun,
p76
aVthat all of the planets in the solar system are orbiting around.
p77
aVAnd that's fundamentally driving atmospheric escape.
p78
aVThe reason that fundamentally stars drive atmospheric escape from planets
p79
aVis because stars offer planets particles and light and heat
p80
aVthat can cause the atmospheres to go away.
p81
aVSo if you think of a hot-air balloon,
p82
aVor you look at this picture of lanterns in Thailand at a festival,
p83
aVyou can see that hot air can propel gasses upward.
p84
aVAnd if you have enough energy and heating,
p85
aVwhich our Sun does,
p86
aVthat gas, which is so light and only bound by gravity,
p87
aVit can escape into space.
p88
aVAnd so this is what's actually causing atmospheric escape
p89
aVhere on Earth and also on other planets \u2014
p90
aVthat interplay between heating from the star
p91
aVand overcoming the force of gravity on the planet.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo I've told you that it happens
p94
aVat the rate of 400 pounds a minute for hydrogen
p95
aVand almost seven pounds for helium.
p96
aVBut what does that look like?
p97
aVWell, even in the '80s,
p98
aVwe took pictures of the Earth
p99
aVin the ultraviolet
p100
aVusing NASA's Dynamic Explorer spacecraft.
p101
aVSo these two images of the Earth
p102
aVshow you what that glow of escaping hydrogen looks like,
p103
aVshown in red.
p104
aVAnd you can also see other features like oxygen and nitrogen
p105
aVin that white glimmer
p106
aVin the circle showing you the auroras
p107
aVand also some wisps around the tropics.
p108
aVSo these are pictures that conclusively show us
p109
aVthat our atmosphere isn't just tightly bound to us here on Earth
p110
aVbut it's actually reaching out far into space,
p111
aVand at an alarming rate, I might add.
p112
aa(lp113
VBut the Earth is not alone in undergoing atmospheric escape.
p114
aVMars, our nearest neighbor, is much smaller than Earth,
p115
aVso it has much less gravity with which to hold on to its atmosphere.
p116
aVAnd so even though Mars has an atmosphere,
p117
aVwe can see it's much thinner than the Earth's.
p118
aVJust look at the surface.
p119
aVYou see craters indicating that it didn't have an atmosphere
p120
aVthat could stop those impacts.
p121
aVAlso, we see that it's the "red planet,"
p122
aVand atmospheric escape plays a role
p123
aVin Mars being red.
p124
aVThat's because we think Mars used to have a wetter past,
p125
aVand when water had enough energy, it broke up into hydrogen and oxygen,
p126
aVand hydrogen being so light, it escaped into space,
p127
aVand the oxygen that was left
p128
aVoxidized or rusted the ground,
p129
aVmaking that familiar rusty red color that we see.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo it's fine to look at pictures of Mars
p132
aVand say that atmospheric escape probably happened,
p133
aVbut NASA has a probe that's currently at Mars called the MAVEN satellite,
p134
aVand its actual job is to study atmospheric escape.
p135
aVIt's the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution spacecraft.
p136
aVAnd results from it have already shown pictures very similar
p137
aVto what you've seen here on Earth.
p138
aVWe've long known that Mars was losing its atmosphere,
p139
aVbut we have some stunning pictures.
p140
aVHere, for example, you can see in the red circle
p141
aVis the size of Mars,
p142
aVand in blue you can see the hydrogen escaping away from the planet.
p143
aVSo it's reaching out more than 10 times the size of the planet,
p144
aVfar enough away that it's no longer bound to that planet.
p145
aVIt's escaping off into space.
p146
aVAnd this helps us confirm ideas,
p147
aVlike why Mars is red, from that lost hydrogen.
p148
aVBut hydrogen isn't the only gas that's lost.
p149
aVI mentioned helium on Earth and some oxygen and nitrogen,
p150
aVand from MAVEN we can also look at the oxygen being lost from Mars.
p151
aVAnd you can see that because oxygen is heavier,
p152
aVit can't get as far as the hydrogen,
p153
aVbut it's still escaping away from the planet.
p154
aVYou don't see it all confined into that red circle.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo the fact that we not only see atmospheric escape on our own planet
p157
aVbut we can study it elsewhere and send spacecraft
p158
aVallows us to learn about the past of planets
p159
aVbut also about planets in general
p160
aVand Earth's future.
p161
aVSo one way we actually can learn about the future
p162
aVis by planets so far away that we can't see.
p163
aVAnd I should just note though, before I go on to that,
p164
aVI'm not going to show you photos like this of Pluto,
p165
aVwhich might be disappointing,
p166
aVbut that's because we don't have them yet.
p167
aVBut the New Horizons mission is currently studying atmospheric escape
p168
aVbeing lost from the planet.
p169
aVSo stay tuned and look out for that.
p170
aVBut the planets that I did want to talk about
p171
aVare known as transiting exoplanets.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo any planet orbiting a star that's not our Sun
p174
aVis called an exoplanet, or extrasolar planet.
p175
aVAnd these planets that we call transiting
p176
aVhave the special feature
p177
aVthat if you look at that star in the middle,
p178
aVyou'll see that actually it's blinking.
p179
aVAnd the reason that it's blinking
p180
aVis because there are planets that are going past it all the time,
p181
aVand it's that special orientation
p182
aVwhere the planets are blocking the light from the star
p183
aVthat allows us to see that light blinking.
p184
aVAnd by surveying the stars in the night sky
p185
aVfor this blinking motion,
p186
aVwe are able to find planets.
p187
aVThis is how we've now been able to detect over 5,000 planets
p188
aVin our own Milky Way,
p189
aVand we know there are many more out there, like I mentioned.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo when we look at the light from these stars,
p192
aVwhat we see, like I said, is not the planet itself,
p193
aVbut you actually see a dimming of the light
p194
aVthat we can record in time.
p195
aVSo the light drops as the planet decreases in front of the star,
p196
aVand that's that blinking that you saw before.
p197
aVSo not only do we detect the planets
p198
aVbut we can look at this light in different wavelengths.
p199
aVSo I mentioned looking at the Earth and Mars in ultraviolet light.
p200
aVIf we look at transiting exoplanets with the Hubble Space Telescope,
p201
aVwe find that in the ultraviolet,
p202
aVyou see much bigger blinking, much less light from the star,
p203
aVwhen the planet is passing in front.
p204
aVAnd we think this is because you have an extended atmosphere of hydrogen
p205
aVall around the planet
p206
aVthat's making it look puffier
p207
aVand thus blocking more of the light that you see.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo using this technique, we've actually been able to discover
p210
aVa few transiting exoplanets that are undergoing atmospheric escape.
p211
aVAnd these planets can be called hot Jupiters,
p212
aVfor some of the ones we've found.
p213
aVAnd that's because they're gas planets like Jupiter,
p214
aVbut they're so close to their star,
p215
aVabout a hundred times closer than Jupiter.
p216
aVAnd because there's all this lightweight gas that's ready to escape,
p217
aVand all this heating from the star,
p218
aVyou have completely catastrophic rates of atmospheric escape.
p219
aVSo unlike our 400 pounds per minute of hydrogen being lost on Earth,
p220
aVfor these planets,
p221
aVyou're losing 1.3 billion pounds of hydrogen every minute.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo you might think, well, does this make the planet cease to exist?
p224
aVAnd this is a question that people wondered
p225
aVwhen they looked at our solar system,
p226
aVbecause planets closer to the Sun are rocky,
p227
aVand planets further away are bigger and more gaseous.
p228
aVCould you have started with something like Jupiter
p229
aVthat was actually close to the Sun,
p230
aVand get rid of all the gas in it?
p231
aVWe now think that if you start with something like a hot Jupiter,
p232
aVyou actually can't end up with Mercury or the Earth.
p233
aVBut if you started with something smaller,
p234
aVit's possible that enough gas would have gotten away
p235
aVthat it would have significantly impacted it
p236
aVand left you with something very different than what you started with.
p237
aa(lp238
VSo all of this sounds sort of general,
p239
aVand we might think about the solar system,
p240
aVbut what does this have to do with us here on Earth?
p241
aVWell, in the far future,
p242
aVthe Sun is going to get brighter.
p243
aVAnd as that happens,
p244
aVthe heating that we find from the Sun is going to become very intense.
p245
aVIn the same way that you see gas streaming off from a hot Jupiter,
p246
aVgas is going to stream off from the Earth.
p247
aVAnd so what we can look forward to,
p248
aVor at least prepare for,
p249
aVis the fact that in the far future,
p250
aVthe Earth is going to look more like Mars.
p251
aVOur hydrogen, from water that is broken down,
p252
aVis going to escape into space more rapidly,
p253
aVand we're going to be left with this dry, reddish planet.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo don't fear, it's not for a few billion years,
p256
aVso there's some time to prepare.
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VBut I wanted you to be aware of what's going on,
p261
aVnot just in the future,
p262
aVbut atmospheric escape is happening as we speak.
p263
aVSo there's a lot of amazing science that you hear about happening in space
p264
aVand planets that are far away,
p265
aVand we are studying these planets to learn about these worlds.
p266
aVBut as we learn about Mars or exoplanets like hot Jupiters,
p267
aVwe find things like atmospheric escape
p268
aVthat tell us a lot more about our planet here on Earth.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo consider that the next time you think that space is far away.
p271
aa(lp272
VThank you.
