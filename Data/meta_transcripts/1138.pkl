VSo as a fashion designer,
p4
aVI've always tended to think of materials
p5
aVsomething like this,
p6
aVor this,
p7
aVor maybe this.
p8
aVBut then I met a biologist,
p9
aVand now I think of materials like this \u2014
p10
aVgreen tea, sugar,
p11
aVa few microbes and a little time.
p12
aVI'm essentially using a kombucha recipe,
p13
aVwhich is a symbiotic mix
p14
aVof bacteria, yeasts and other micro-organisms,
p15
aVwhich spin cellulose
p16
aVin a fermentation process.
p17
aVOver time, these tiny threads
p18
aVform in the liquid into layers
p19
aVand produce a mat on the surface.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo we start by brewing the tea.
p22
aVI brew up to about 30 liters of tea at a time,
p23
aVand then while it's still hot, add a couple of kilos of sugar.
p24
aVWe stir this in until it's completely dissolved
p25
aVand then pour it into a growth bath.
p26
aVWe need to check that the temperature
p27
aVhas cooled to below 30 degrees C.
p28
aVAnd then we're ready to add the living organism.
p29
aVAnd along with that, some acetic acid.
p30
aVAnd once you get this process going,
p31
aVyou can actually recycle
p32
aVyour previous fermented liquid.
p33
aVWe need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth.
p34
aVAnd I use a heat mat to sit the bath on
p35
aVand a thermostat to regulate it.
p36
aVAnd actually, in hot weather, I can just grow it outside.
p37
aVSo this is my mini fabric farm.
p38
aa(lp39
VAfter about three days,
p40
aVthe bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid.
p41
aVSo this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing.
p42
aVAnd the bacteria are feeding
p43
aVon the sugar nutrients in the liquid.
p44
aVSo they're spinning these tiny nano fibers
p45
aVof pure cellulose.
p46
aVAnd they're sticking together, forming layers
p47
aVand giving us a sheet on the surface.
p48
aVAfter about two to three weeks,
p49
aVwe're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness.
p50
aVSo the bath on the left is after five days,
p51
aVand on the right, after 10.
p52
aVAnd this is a static culture.
p53
aVYou don't have to do anything to it;
p54
aVyou just literally watch it grow.
p55
aVIt doesn't need light.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd when it's ready to harvest, you take it out of the bath
p58
aVand you wash it in cold, soapy water.
p59
aVAt this point, it's really heavy.
p60
aVIt's over 90 percent water,
p61
aVso we need to let that evaporate.
p62
aVSo I spread it out onto a wooden sheet.
p63
aVAgain, you can do that outside
p64
aVand just let it dry in the air.
p65
aVAnd as it's drying, it's compressing,
p66
aVso what you're left with, depending on the recipe,
p67
aVis something that's either
p68
aVlike a really light-weight, transparent paper,
p69
aVor something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather.
p70
aVAnd then you can either cut that out
p71
aVand sew it conventionally,
p72
aVor you can use the wet material
p73
aVto form it around a three-dimensional shape.
p74
aVAnd as it evaporates,
p75
aVit will knit itself together, forming seams.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea.
p78
aVI guess it also looks a little bit like human skin,
p79
aVwhich intrigues me.
p80
aVSince it's organic,
p81
aVI'm really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals.
p82
aVI can make it change color without using dye
p83
aVby a process of iron oxidation.
p84
aVUsing fruit and vegetable staining,
p85
aVcreate organic patterning.
p86
aVAnd using indigo,
p87
aVmake it anti-microbial.
p88
aVAnd in fact, cotton
p89
aVwould take up to 18 dips in indigo
p90
aVto achieve a color this dark.
p91
aVAnd because of the super-absorbency of this kind of cellulose,
p92
aVit just takes one, and a really short one at that.
p93
aa(lp94
VWhat I can't yet do is make it water-resistant.
p95
aVSo if I was to walk outside in the rain
p96
aVwearing this dress today,
p97
aVI would immediately start to absorb
p98
aVhuge amounts of water.
p99
aVThe dress would get really heavy,
p100
aVand eventually the seams would probably fall apart \u2014
p101
aVleaving me feeling rather naked.
p102
aVPossibly a good performance piece,
p103
aVbut definitely not ideal for everyday wear.
p104
aVWhat I'm looking for
p105
aVis a way to give the material
p106
aVthe qualities that I need.
p107
aVSo what I want to do is say to a future bug,
p108
aV"Spin me a thread.
p109
aVAlign it in this direction.
p110
aVMake it hydrophobic.
p111
aVAnd while you're at it,
p112
aVjust form it around this 3D shape."
p113
aa(lp114
VBacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing,
p115
aVand possibly in the future
p116
aVfor biocompatible blood vessels,
p117
aVpossibly even replacement bone tissue.
p118
aVBut with synthetic biology,
p119
aVwe can actually imagine engineering this bacterium
p120
aVto produce something
p121
aVthat gives us the quality,
p122
aVquantity and shape
p123
aVof material that we desire.
p124
aVObviously, as a designer, that's really exciting
p125
aVbecause then I start to think, wow,
p126
aVwe could actually imagine
p127
aVgrowing consumable products.
p128
aa(lp129
VWhat excites me about using microbes
p130
aVis their efficiency.
p131
aVSo we only grow what we need.
p132
aVThere's no waste.
p133
aVAnd in fact, we could make it from a waste stream \u2014
p134
aVso for example,
p135
aVa waste sugar stream
p136
aVfrom a food processing plant.
p137
aVFinally, at the end of use, we could biodegrade it naturally
p138
aValong with your vegetable peelings.
p139
aVWhat I'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose
p140
aVis going to be a replacement
p141
aVfor cotton, leather or other textile materials.
p142
aVBut I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition
p143
aVto our increasingly precious natural resources.
p144
aa(lp145
VUltimately, maybe it won't even be fashion
p146
aVwhere we see these microbes have their impact.
p147
aVWe could, for example, imagine
p148
aVgrowing a lamp, a chair,
p149
aVa car or maybe even a house.
p150
aVSo I guess what my question to you is:
p151
aVin the future, what would you choose to grow?
p152
aVThank you very much.

p155
aVBruno Giussani: Suzanne, just a curiosity,
p156
aVwhat you're wearing is not random. (Suzanne Lee: No.)
p157
aVThis is one of the jackets you grew?
p158
aa(lp159
VSL: Yes, it is.
p160
aVIt's probably \u2014 part of the project's still in process
p161
aVbecause this one
p162
aVis actually biodegrading in front of your eyes.
p163
aV(Laughter)
p164
aVIt's absorbing my sweat, and it's feeding on it.
p165
aa(lp166
VBG: Okay, so we'll let you go and save it, and rescue it.
p167
aVSuzanne Lee. (SL: Thank you.)
