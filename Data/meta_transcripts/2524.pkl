VWar has been a part of my life since I can remember.
p4
aVI was born in Afghanistan, just six months after the Soviets invaded,
p5
aVand even though I was too young to understand what was happening,
p6
aVI had a deep sense of the suffering and the fear around me.
p7
aa(lp8
VThose early experiences had a major impact on how I now think about war and conflict.
p9
aVI learned that when people have a fundamental issue at stake,
p10
aVfor most of them,
p11
aVgiving in is not an option.
p12
aVFor these types conflicts \u2014
p13
aVwhen people's rights are violated,
p14
aVwhen their countries are occupied,
p15
aVwhen they're oppressed and humiliated \u2014
p16
aVthey need a powerful way to resist and to fight back.
p17
aVWhich means that no matter how destructive and terrible violence is,
p18
aVif people see it as their only choice,
p19
aVthey will use it.
p20
aVMost of us are concerned with the level of violence in the world.
p21
aVBut we're not going to end war
p22
aVby telling people that violence is morally wrong.
p23
aVInstead, we must offer them a tool
p24
aVthat's at least as powerful and as effective as violence.
p25
aa(lp26
VThis is the work I do.
p27
aVFor the past 13 years,
p28
aVI've been teaching people
p29
aVin some of the most difficult situations around the world
p30
aVhow they can use nonviolent struggle to conduct conflict.
p31
aVMost people associate this type of action with Gandhi and Martin Luther King.
p32
aVBut people have been using nonviolent action for thousands of years.
p33
aVIn fact, most of the rights that we have today in this country \u2014
p34
aVas women,
p35
aVas minorities,
p36
aVas workers,
p37
aVas people of different sexual orientations
p38
aVand citizens concerned with the environment \u2014
p39
aVthese rights weren't handed to us.
p40
aVThey were won by people who fought for them
p41
aVand who sacrificed for them.
p42
aVBut because we haven't learned from this history,
p43
aVnonviolent struggle as a technique is widely misunderstood.
p44
aa(lp45
VI met recently with a group of Ethiopian activists,
p46
aVand they told me something that I hear a lot.
p47
aVThey said they'd already tried nonviolent action,
p48
aVand it hadn't worked.
p49
aVYears ago they held a protest.
p50
aVThe government arrested everyone, and that was the end of that.
p51
aVThe idea that nonviolent struggle is equivalent to street protests
p52
aVis a real problem.
p53
aVBecause although protests can be a great way to show that people want change,
p54
aVon their own, they don't actually create change \u2014
p55
aVat least change that is fundamental.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VPowerful opponents are not going to give people what they want
p60
aVjust because they asked nicely ...
p61
aVor even not so nicely.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VNonviolent struggle works by destroying an opponent,
p66
aVnot physically,
p67
aVbut by identifying the institutions that an opponent needs to survive,
p68
aVand then denying them those sources of power.
p69
aVNonviolent activists can neutralize the military
p70
aVby causing soldiers to defect.
p71
aVThey can disrupt the economy through strikes and boycotts.
p72
aVAnd they can challenge government propaganda
p73
aVby creating alternative media.
p74
aa(lp75
VThere are a variety of methods that can be used to do this.
p76
aVMy colleague and mentor, Gene Sharp,
p77
aVhas identified 198 methods of nonviolent action.
p78
aVAnd protest is only one.
p79
aVLet me give you a recent example.
p80
aa(lp81
VUntil a few months ago,
p82
aVGuatemala was ruled by corrupt former military officials
p83
aVwith ties to organized crime.
p84
aVPeople were generally aware of this,
p85
aVbut most of them felt powerless to do anything about it \u2014
p86
aVuntil one group of citizens, just 12 regular people,
p87
aVput out a call on Facebook to their friends
p88
aVto meet in the central plaza, holding signs with a message:
p89
aV"Renuncia YA" \u2014
p90
aVresign already.
p91
aVTo their surprise,
p92
aV30,000 people showed up.
p93
aVThey stayed there for months as protests spread throughout the country.
p94
aVAt one point,
p95
aVthe organizers delivered hundreds of eggs to various government buildings
p96
aVwith a message:
p97
aV"If you don't have the huevos" \u2014
p98
aVthe balls \u2014
p99
aV"to stop corrupt candidates from running for office,
p100
aVyou can borrow ours."
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
V(Applause)
p105
aa(lp106
VPresident Molina responded
p107
aVby vowing that he would never step down.
p108
aVAnd the activists realized that they couldn't just keep protesting
p109
aVand ask the president to resign.
p110
aVThey needed to leave him no choice.
p111
aVSo they organized a general strike,
p112
aVin which people throughout the country refused to work.
p113
aVIn Guatemala City alone,
p114
aVover 400 businesses and schools shut their doors.
p115
aVMeanwhile,
p116
aVfarmers throughout the country blocked major roads.
p117
aVWithin five days,
p118
aVthe president,
p119
aValong with dozens of other government officials,
p120
aVresigned already.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Applause)
p123
aa(lp124
VI've been greatly inspired
p125
aVby the creativity and bravery of people using nonviolent action
p126
aVin nearly every country in the world.
p127
aVFor example,
p128
aVrecently a group of activists in Uganda
p129
aVreleased a crate of pigs in the streets.
p130
aVYou can see here that the police are confused about what to do with them.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VThe pigs were painted the color of the ruling party.
p135
aVOne pig was even wearing a hat,
p136
aVa hat that people recognized.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VActivists around the world are getting better at grabbing headlines,
p141
aVbut these isolated actions do very little
p142
aVif they're not part of a larger strategy.
p143
aVA general wouldn't march his troops into battle
p144
aVunless he had a plan to win the war.
p145
aVYet this is how most of the world's nonviolent movements operate.
p146
aVNonviolent struggle is just as complex as military warfare,
p147
aVif not more.
p148
aVIts participants must be well-trained and have clear objectives,
p149
aVand its leaders must have a strategy of how to achieve those objectives.
p150
aa(lp151
VThe technique of war has been developed over thousands of years
p152
aVwith massive resources
p153
aVand some of our best minds dedicated to understanding
p154
aVand improving how it works.
p155
aVMeanwhile, nonviolent struggle is rarely systematically studied,
p156
aVand even though the number is growing,
p157
aVthere are still only a few dozen people in the world who are teaching it.
p158
aVThis is dangerous,
p159
aVbecause we now know that our old approaches of dealing with conflict
p160
aVare not adequate for the new challenges that we're facing.
p161
aa(lp162
VThe US government recently admitted
p163
aVthat it's in a stalemate in its war against ISIS.
p164
aVBut what most people don't know
p165
aVis that people have stood up to ISIS using nonviolent action.
p166
aVWhen ISIS captured Mosul in June 2014,
p167
aVthey announced that they were putting in place a new public school curriculum,
p168
aVbased on their own extremist ideology.
p169
aVBut on the first day of school,
p170
aVnot a single child showed up.
p171
aVParents simply refused to send them.
p172
aVThey told journalists they would rather homeschool their children
p173
aVthan to have them brainwashed.
p174
aa(lp175
VThis is an example of just one act of defiance
p176
aVin just one city.
p177
aVBut what if it was coordinated
p178
aVwith the dozens of other acts of nonviolent resistance
p179
aVthat have taken place against ISIS?
p180
aVWhat if the parents' boycott was part of a larger strategy
p181
aVto identify and cut off the resources that ISIS needs to function;
p182
aVthe skilled labor needed to produce food;
p183
aVthe engineers needed to extract and refine oil;
p184
aVthe media infrastructure and communications networks
p185
aVand transportation systems,
p186
aVand the local businesses that ISIS relies on?
p187
aVIt may be difficult to imagine defeating ISIS
p188
aVwith action that is nonviolent.
p189
aVBut it's time we challenge the way we think about conflict
p190
aVand the choices we have in facing it.
p191
aa(lp192
VHere's an idea worth spreading:
p193
aVlet's learn more about where nonviolent action has worked
p194
aVand how we can make it more powerful,
p195
aVjust like we do with other systems and technologies
p196
aVthat are constantly being refined to better meet human needs.
p197
aVIt may be that we can improve nonviolent action
p198
aVto a point where it is increasingly used in place of war.
p199
aVViolence as a tool of conflict could then be abandoned
p200
aVin the same way that bows and arrows were,
p201
aVbecause we have replaced them with weapons that are more effective.
p202
aVWith human innovation, we can make nonviolent struggle more powerful
p203
aVthan the newest and latest technologies of war.
p204
aVThe greatest hope for humanity lies not in condemning violence
p205
aVbut in making violence obsolete.
p206
aa(lp207
VThank you.
