VSome years ago, I set out to try to understand
p4
aVif there was a possibility to develop biofuels
p5
aVon a scale that would actually compete with fossil fuels
p6
aVbut not compete with agriculture for water,
p7
aVfertilizer or land.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo here's what I came up with.
p10
aVImagine that we build an enclosure where we put it
p11
aVjust underwater, and we fill it with wastewater
p12
aVand some form of microalgae that produces oil,
p13
aVand we make it out of some kind of flexible material
p14
aVthat moves with waves underwater,
p15
aVand the system that we're going to build, of course,
p16
aVwill use solar energy to grow the algae,
p17
aVand they use CO2, which is good,
p18
aVand they produce oxygen as they grow.
p19
aVThe algae that grow are in a container that
p20
aVdistributes the heat to the surrounding water,
p21
aVand you can harvest them and make biofuels
p22
aVand cosmetics and fertilizer and animal feed,
p23
aVand of course you'd have to make a large area of this,
p24
aVso you'd have to worry about other stakeholders
p25
aVlike fishermen and ships and such things, but hey,
p26
aVwe're talking about biofuels,
p27
aVand we know the importance of potentially getting
p28
aVan alternative liquid fuel.
p29
aa(lp30
VWhy are we talking about microalgae?
p31
aVHere you see a graph showing you the different types
p32
aVof crops that are being considered for making biofuels,
p33
aVso you can see some things like soybean,
p34
aVwhich makes 50 gallons per acre per year,
p35
aVor sunflower or canola or jatropha or palm, and that
p36
aVtall graph there shows what microalgae can contribute.
p37
aVThat is to say, microalgae contributes between 2,000
p38
aVand 5,000 gallons per acre per year,
p39
aVcompared to the 50 gallons per acre per year from soy.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo what are microalgae? Microalgae are micro \u2014
p42
aVthat is, they're extremely small, as you can see here
p43
aVa picture of those single-celled organisms
p44
aVcompared to a human hair.
p45
aVThose small organisms have been around
p46
aVfor millions of years and there's thousands
p47
aVof different species of microalgae in the world,
p48
aVsome of which are the fastest-growing plants on the planet,
p49
aVand produce, as I just showed you, lots and lots of oil.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow, why do we want to do this offshore?
p52
aVWell, the reason we're doing this offshore is because
p53
aVif you look at our coastal cities, there isn't a choice,
p54
aVbecause we're going to use waste water, as I suggested,
p55
aVand if you look at where most of the waste water
p56
aVtreatment plants are, they're embedded in the cities.
p57
aVThis is the city of San Francisco, which has 900 miles
p58
aVof sewer pipes under the city already,
p59
aVand it releases its waste water offshore.
p60
aVSo different cities around the world treat their waste water
p61
aVdifferently. Some cities process it.
p62
aVSome cities just release the water.
p63
aVBut in all cases, the water that's released is
p64
aVperfectly adequate for growing microalgae.
p65
aVSo let's envision what the system might look like.
p66
aVWe call it OMEGA, which is an acronym for
p67
aVOffshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae.
p68
aVAt NASA, you have to have good acronyms.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo how does it work? I sort of showed you how it works already.
p71
aVWe put waste water and some source of CO2
p72
aVinto our floating structure,
p73
aVand the waste water provides nutrients for the algae to grow,
p74
aVand they sequester CO2 that would otherwise go off
p75
aVinto the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas.
p76
aVThey of course use solar energy to grow,
p77
aVand the wave energy on the surface provides energy
p78
aVfor mixing the algae, and the temperature
p79
aVis controlled by the surrounding water temperature.
p80
aVThe algae that grow produce oxygen, as I've mentioned,
p81
aVand they also produce biofuels and fertilizer and food and
p82
aVother bi-algal products of interest.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd the system is contained. What do I mean by that?
p85
aVIt's modular. Let's say something happens that's
p86
aVtotally unexpected to one of the modules.
p87
aVIt leaks. It's struck by lightning.
p88
aVThe waste water that leaks out is water that already now
p89
aVgoes into that coastal environment, and
p90
aVthe algae that leak out are biodegradable,
p91
aVand because they're living in waste water,
p92
aVthey're fresh water algae, which means they can't
p93
aVlive in salt water, so they die.
p94
aVThe plastic we'll build it out of is some kind of
p95
aVwell-known plastic that we have good experience with, and
p96
aVwe'll rebuild our modules to be able to reuse them again.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo we may be able to go beyond that when thinking about
p99
aVthis system that I'm showing you, and that is to say
p100
aVwe need to think in terms of the water, the fresh water,
p101
aVwhich is also going to be an issue in the future,
p102
aVand we're working on methods now
p103
aVfor recovering the waste water.
p104
aa(lp105
VThe other thing to consider is the structure itself.
p106
aVIt provides a surface for things in the ocean,
p107
aVand this surface, which is covered by seaweeds
p108
aVand other organisms in the ocean,
p109
aVwill become enhanced marine habitat
p110
aVso it increases biodiversity.
p111
aVAnd finally, because it's an offshore structure,
p112
aVwe can think in terms of how it might contribute
p113
aVto an aquaculture activity offshore.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo you're probably thinking, "Gee, this sounds
p116
aVlike a good idea. What can we do to try to see if it's real?"
p117
aVWell, I set up laboratories in Santa Cruz
p118
aVat the California Fish and Game facility,
p119
aVand that facility allowed us to have big seawater tanks
p120
aVto test some of these ideas.
p121
aVWe also set up experiments in San Francisco
p122
aVat one of the three waste water treatment plants,
p123
aVagain a facility to test ideas.
p124
aVAnd finally, we wanted to see where we could look at
p125
aVwhat the impact of this structure would be
p126
aVin the marine environment, and we set up a field site
p127
aVat a place called Moss Landing Marine Lab
p128
aVin Monterey Bay, where we worked in a harbor
p129
aVto see what impact this would have on marine organisms.
p130
aa(lp131
VThe laboratory that we set up in Santa Cruz was our skunkworks.
p132
aVIt was a place where we were growing algae
p133
aVand welding plastic and building tools
p134
aVand making a lot of mistakes,
p135
aVor, as Edison said, we were
p136
aVfinding the 10,000 ways that the system wouldn't work.
p137
aVNow, we grew algae in waste water, and we built tools
p138
aVthat allowed us to get into the lives of algae
p139
aVso that we could monitor the way they grow,
p140
aVwhat makes them happy, how do we make sure that
p141
aVwe're going to have a culture that will survive and thrive.
p142
aVSo the most important feature that we needed to develop were these
p143
aVso-called photobioreactors, or PBRs.
p144
aVThese were the structures that would be floating at the
p145
aVsurface made out of some inexpensive plastic material
p146
aVthat'll allow the algae to grow, and we had built lots and lots
p147
aVof designs, most of which were horrible failures,
p148
aVand when we finally got to a design that worked,
p149
aVat about 30 gallons, we scaled it up
p150
aVto 450 gallons in San Francisco.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo let me show you how the system works.
p153
aVWe basically take waste water with algae of our choice in it,
p154
aVand we circulate it through this floating structure,
p155
aVthis tubular, flexible plastic structure,
p156
aVand it circulates through this thing,
p157
aVand there's sunlight of course, it's at the surface,
p158
aVand the algae grow on the nutrients.
p159
aa(lp160
VBut this is a bit like putting your head in a plastic bag.
p161
aVThe algae are not going to suffocate because of CO2,
p162
aVas we would.
p163
aVThey suffocate because they produce oxygen, and they
p164
aVdon't really suffocate, but the oxygen that they produce
p165
aVis problematic, and they use up all the CO2.
p166
aVSo the next thing we had to figure out was how we could
p167
aVremove the oxygen, which we did by building this column
p168
aVwhich circulated some of the water,
p169
aVand put back CO2, which we did by bubbling the system
p170
aVbefore we recirculated the water.
p171
aVAnd what you see here is the prototype,
p172
aVwhich was the first attempt at building this type of column.
p173
aVThe larger column that we then installed in San Francisco
p174
aVin the installed system.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo the column actually had another very nice feature,
p177
aVand that is the algae settle in the column,
p178
aVand this allowed us to accumulate the algal biomass
p179
aVin a context where we could easily harvest it.
p180
aVSo we would remove the algaes that concentrated
p181
aVin the bottom of this column, and then we could
p182
aVharvest that by a procedure where you float the algae
p183
aVto the surface and can skim it off with a net.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo we wanted to also investigate what would be the impact
p186
aVof this system in the marine environment,
p187
aVand I mentioned we set up this experiment at a field site
p188
aVin Moss Landing Marine Lab.
p189
aVWell, we found of course that this material became
p190
aVovergrown with algae, and we needed then to develop
p191
aVa cleaning procedure, and we also looked at how
p192
aVseabirds and marine mammals interacted, and in fact you
p193
aVsee here a sea otter that found this incredibly interesting,
p194
aVand would periodically work its way across this little
p195
aVfloating water bed, and we wanted to hire this guy
p196
aVor train him to be able to clean the surface
p197
aVof these things, but that's for the future.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow really what we were doing,
p200
aVwe were working in four areas.
p201
aVOur research covered the biology of the system,
p202
aVwhich included studying the way algae grew,
p203
aVbut also what eats the algae, and what kills the algae.
p204
aVWe did engineering to understand what we would need
p205
aVto be able to do to build this structure,
p206
aVnot only on the small scale, but how we would build it
p207
aVon this enormous scale that will ultimately be required.
p208
aVI mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals
p209
aVand looked at basically the environmental impact
p210
aVof the system, and finally we looked at the economics,
p211
aVand what I mean by economics is,
p212
aVwhat is the energy required to run the system?
p213
aVDo you get more energy out of the system
p214
aVthan you have to put into the system
p215
aVto be able to make the system run?
p216
aVAnd what about operating costs?
p217
aVAnd what about capital costs?
p218
aVAnd what about, just, the whole economic structure?
p219
aa(lp220
VSo let me tell you that it's not going to be easy,
p221
aVand there's lots more work to do in all four
p222
aVof those areas to be able to really make the system work.
p223
aVBut we don't have a lot of time, and I'd like to show you
p224
aVthe artist's conception of how this system might look
p225
aVif we find ourselves in a protected bay
p226
aVsomewhere in the world, and we have in the background
p227
aVin this image, the waste water treatment plant
p228
aVand a source of flue gas for the CO2,
p229
aVbut when you do the economics of this system,
p230
aVyou find that in fact it will be difficult to make it work.
p231
aVUnless you look at the system as a way to treat waste water,
p232
aVsequester carbon, and potentially for photovoltaic panels
p233
aVor wave energy or even wind energy,
p234
aVand if you start thinking in terms of
p235
aVintegrating all of these different activities,
p236
aVyou could also include in such a facility aquaculture.
p237
aVSo we would have under this system a shellfish aquaculture
p238
aVwhere we're growing mussels or scallops.
p239
aVWe'd be growing oysters and things
p240
aVthat would be producing high value products and food,
p241
aVand this would be a market driver as we build the system
p242
aVto larger and larger scales so that it becomes, ultimately,
p243
aVcompetitive with the idea of doing it for fuels.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo there's always a big question that comes up,
p246
aVbecause plastic in the ocean has got a really bad reputation
p247
aVright now, and so we've been thinking cradle to cradle.
p248
aVWhat are we going to do with all this plastic that we're
p249
aVgoing to need to use in our marine environment?
p250
aVWell, I don't know if you know about this,
p251
aVbut in California, there's a huge amount of plastic
p252
aVthat's used in fields right now as plastic mulch,
p253
aVand this is plastic that's making these tiny little greenhouses
p254
aVright along the surface of the soil, and this provides
p255
aVwarming the soil to increase the growing season,
p256
aVit allows us to control weeds,
p257
aVand, of course, it makes the watering much more efficient.
p258
aVSo the OMEGA system will be part
p259
aVof this type of an outcome, and that when we're finished
p260
aVusing it in the marine environment, we'll be using it,
p261
aVhopefully, on fields.
p262
aa(lp263
VWhere are we going to put this,
p264
aVand what will it look like offshore?
p265
aVHere's an image of what we could do in San Francisco Bay.
p266
aVSan Francisco produces 65 million gallons a day
p267
aVof waste water. If we imagine a five-day retention time
p268
aVfor this system, we'd need 325 million gallons
p269
aVto accomodate, and that would be about 1,280 acres
p270
aVof these OMEGA modules floating in San Francisco Bay.
p271
aVWell, that's less than one percent
p272
aVof the surface area of the bay.
p273
aVIt would produce, at 2,000 gallons per acre per year,
p274
aVit would produce over 2 million gallons of fuel,
p275
aVwhich is about 20 percent of the biodiesel,
p276
aVor of the diesel that would be required in San Francisco,
p277
aVand that's without doing anything about efficiency.
p278
aa(lp279
VWhere else could we potentially put this system?
p280
aVThere's lots of possibilities.
p281
aVThere's, of course, San Francisco Bay, as I mentioned.
p282
aVSan Diego Bay is another example,
p283
aVMobile Bay or Chesapeake Bay, but the reality is,
p284
aVas sea level rises, there's going to be lots and lots
p285
aVof new opportunities to consider. (Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
VSo what I'm telling you about is a system
p288
aVof integrated activities.
p289
aVBiofuels production is integrated with alternative energy
p290
aVis integrated with aquaculture.
p291
aa(lp292
VI set out to find a pathway
p293
aVto innovative production of sustainable biofuels,
p294
aVand en route I discovered that what's really required
p295
aVfor sustainability is integration more than innovation.
p296
aa(lp297
VLong term, I have great faith
p298
aVin our collective and connected ingenuity.
p299
aVI think there is almost no limit to what we can accomplish
p300
aVif we are radically open
p301
aVand we don't care who gets the credit.
p302
aVSustainable solutions for our future problems
p303
aVare going to be diverse
p304
aVand are going to be many.
p305
aVI think we need to consider everything,
p306
aVeverything from alpha to OMEGA.
p307
aVThank you. (Applause)
p308
aV(Applause)
p309
aVChris Anderson: Just a quick question for you, Jonathan.
p310
aVCan this project continue to move forward within
p311
aVNASA or do you need some very ambitious
p312
aVgreen energy fund to come and take it by the throat?
p313
aVJonathan Trent: So it's really gotten to a stage now
p314
aVin NASA where they would like to spin it out into something
p315
aVwhich would go offshore, and there are a lot of issues
p316
aVwith doing it in the United States because of limited
p317
aVpermitting issues and the time required to get permits
p318
aVto do things offshore.
p319
aVIt really requires, at this point, people on the outside,
p320
aVand we're being radically open with this technology
p321
aVin which we're going to launch it out there
p322
aVfor anybody and everybody who's interested
p323
aVto take it on and try to make it real.
p324
aVCA: So that's interesting. You're not patenting it.
p325
aVYou're publishing it.
p326
aVJT: Absolutely.
p327
aVCA: All right. Thank you so much.
p328
aVJT: Thank you. (Applause)
