VIn 2011, during the final six months of Kim Jong-Il's life,
p4
aVI lived undercover in North Korea.
p5
aa(lp6
VI was born and raised in South Korea, their enemy.
p7
aVI live in America, their other enemy.
p8
aa(lp9
VSince 2002, I had visited North Korea a few times.
p10
aVAnd I had come to realize that to write about it with any meaning,
p11
aVor to understand the place beyond the regime's propaganda,
p12
aVthe only option was total immersion.
p13
aVSo I posed as a teacher and a missionary
p14
aVat an all-male university in Pyongyang.
p15
aa(lp16
VThe Pyongyang University of Science and Technology
p17
aVwas founded by Evangelical Christians who cooperate with the regime
p18
aVto educate the sons of the North Korean elite,
p19
aVwithout proselytizing, which is a capital crime there.
p20
aVThe students were 270 young men, expected to be the future leaders
p21
aVof the most isolated and brutal dictatorship in existence.
p22
aVWhen I arrived, they became my students.
p23
aa(lp24
V2011 was a special year,
p25
aVmarking the 100th anniversary of the birth of North Korea's original Great Leader,
p26
aVKim Il-Sung.
p27
aVTo celebrate the occasion, the regime shut down all universities,
p28
aVand sent students off to the fields
p29
aVto build the DPRK's much-heralded ideal
p30
aVas the world's most powerful and prosperous nation.
p31
aVMy students were the only ones spared from that fate.
p32
aa(lp33
VNorth Korea is a gulag posing as a nation.
p34
aVEverything there is about the Great Leader.
p35
aVEvery book, every newspaper article, every song, every TV program \u2014
p36
aVthere is just one subject.
p37
aVThe flowers are named after him,
p38
aVthe mountains are carved with his slogans.
p39
aVEvery citizen wears the badge of the Great Leader at all times.
p40
aVEven their calendar system begins with the birth of Kim Il-Sung.
p41
aa(lp42
VThe school was a heavily guarded prison, posing as a campus.
p43
aVTeachers could only leave on group outings accompanied by an official minder.
p44
aVEven then, our trips were limited to sanctioned national monuments
p45
aVcelebrating the Great Leader.
p46
aVThe students were not allowed to leave the campus,
p47
aVor communicate with their parents.
p48
aVTheir days were meticulously mapped out, and any free time they had
p49
aVwas devoted to honoring their Great Leader.
p50
aVLesson plans had to meet the approval of North Korean staff,
p51
aVevery class was recorded and reported on, every room was bugged,
p52
aVand every conversation, overheard.
p53
aVEvery blank space was covered with the  portraits of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il,
p54
aVlike everywhere else in North Korea.
p55
aa(lp56
VWe were never allowed to discuss the outside world.
p57
aVAs students of science and technology, many of them were computer majors
p58
aVbut they did not know the existence of the Internet.
p59
aVThey had never heard of Mark Zuckerberg or Steve Jobs.
p60
aVFacebook, Twitter \u2014 none of those things would have meant a thing.
p61
aVAnd I could not tell them.
p62
aa(lp63
VI went there looking for truth.
p64
aVBut where do you even start when an entire nation's ideology,
p65
aVmy students' day-to-day realities,
p66
aVand even my own position at the universities,
p67
aVwere all built on lies?
p68
aa(lp69
VI started with a game.
p70
aVWe played "Truth and Lie."
p71
aVA volunteer would write a sentence on the chalkboard,
p72
aVand the other students had to guess
p73
aVwhether it was a truth or a lie.
p74
aVOnce a student wrote, "I visited China last year on vacation,"
p75
aVand everyone shouted, "Lie!"
p76
aVThey all knew this wasn't possible.
p77
aVVirtually no North Korean is allowed to leave the country.
p78
aVEven traveling within their own country requires a travel pass.
p79
aa(lp80
VI had hoped that this game would reveal some truth about my students,
p81
aVbecause they lie so often and so easily,
p82
aVwhether about the mythical accomplishments of their Great Leader,
p83
aVor the strange claim that they cloned a rabbit as fifth graders.
p84
aVThe difference between truth and lies seemed at times hazy to them.
p85
aVIt took me a while to understand the different types of lies;
p86
aVthey lie to shield their system from the world,
p87
aVor they were taught lies, and were just regurgitating them.
p88
aVOr, at moments, they lied out of habit.
p89
aVBut if all they have ever known were lies,
p90
aVhow could we expect them to be otherwise?
p91
aa(lp92
VNext, I tried to teach them essay writing.
p93
aVBut that turned out to be nearly impossible.
p94
aVEssays are about coming up with one's own thesis,
p95
aVand making an evidence-based argument to prove it.
p96
aVThese students, however, were simply told what to think,
p97
aVand they obeyed.
p98
aVIn their world, critical thinking was not allowed.
p99
aa(lp100
VI also gave them the weekly assignment of writing a personal letter,
p101
aVto anybody.
p102
aVIt took a long time, but eventually some of them began to write
p103
aVto their mothers, their friends, their girlfriends.
p104
aVAlthough those were just homework,
p105
aVand would never reach their intended recipients,
p106
aVmy students slowly began to reveal their true feelings in them.
p107
aVThey wrote that they were fed up with the sameness of everything.
p108
aVThey were worried about their future.
p109
aVIn those letters, they rarely ever mentioned their Great Leader.
p110
aa(lp111
VI was spending all of my time with these young men.
p112
aVWe all ate meals together, played basketball together.
p113
aVI often called them gentlemen, which made them giggle.
p114
aVThey blushed at the mention of girls.
p115
aVAnd I came to adore them.
p116
aVAnd watching them open up even in the tiniest of ways,
p117
aVwas deeply moving.
p118
aa(lp119
VBut something also felt wrong.
p120
aVDuring those months of living in their world,
p121
aVI often wondered if the truth would, in fact, improve their lives.
p122
aVI wanted so much to tell them the truth,
p123
aVof their country and of the outside world,
p124
aVwhere Arab youth were turning their rotten regime inside out,
p125
aVusing the power of social media,
p126
aVwhere everyone except them was connected through the world wide web,
p127
aVwhich wasn't worldwide after all.
p128
aVBut for them, the truth was dangerous.
p129
aVBy encouraging them to run after it, I was putting them at risk \u2014
p130
aVof persecution,
p131
aVof heartbreak.
p132
aa(lp133
VWhen you're not allowed to express anything in the open,
p134
aVyou become good at reading what is unspoken.
p135
aVIn one of their personal letters to me, a student wrote that he understood
p136
aVwhy I always called them gentlemen.
p137
aVIt was because I was wishing them to be gentle in life, he said.
p138
aa(lp139
VOn my last day in December of 2011,
p140
aVthe day Kim Jong-Il's death was announced,
p141
aVtheir world shattered.
p142
aVI had to leave without a proper goodbye.
p143
aVBut I think they knew how sad I was for them.
p144
aa(lp145
VOnce, toward the end of my stay, a student said to me,
p146
aV"Professor, we never think of you as being different from us.
p147
aVOur circumstances are different, but you're the same as us.
p148
aVWe want you to know that we truly think of you as being the same."
p149
aa(lp150
VToday, if I could respond to my students with a letter of my own,
p151
aVwhich is of course impossible,
p152
aVI would tell them this:
p153
aV"My dear gentlemen,
p154
aVIt's been a bit over three years since I last saw you.
p155
aVAnd now, you must be 22 \u2014 maybe even as old as 23.
p156
aVAt our final class, I asked you if there was anything you wanted.
p157
aVThe only wish you expressed, the only thing you ever asked of me
p158
aVin all those months we spent together,
p159
aVwas for me to speak to you in Korean.
p160
aVJust once.
p161
aVI was there to teach you English;
p162
aVyou knew it wasn't allowed.
p163
aVBut I understood then, you wanted to share that bond of our mother tongue.
p164
aVI called you my gentlemen,
p165
aVbut I don't know if being gentle in Kim Jong-Un's merciless North Korea
p166
aVis a good thing.
p167
aVI don't want you to lead a revolution \u2014
p168
aVlet some other young person do it.
p169
aVThe rest of the world might casually encourage or even expect
p170
aVsome sort of North Korean Spring,
p171
aVbut I don't want you to do anything risky,
p172
aVbecause I know in your world, someone is always watching.
p173
aVI don't want to imagine what might happen to you.
p174
aVIf my attempts to reach you have inspired something new in you,
p175
aVI would rather you forget me.
p176
aVBecome soldiers of your Great Leader, and live long, safe lives.
p177
aVYou once asked me if I thought your city of Pyongyang was beautiful,
p178
aVand I could not answer truthfully then.
p179
aVBut I know why you asked.
p180
aVI know that it was important for you to hear that I, your teacher,
p181
aVthe one who has seen the world that you are forbidden from,
p182
aVdeclare your city as the most beautiful.
p183
aVI know hearing that would make your lives there a bit more bearable,
p184
aVbut no, I don't find your capital beautiful.
p185
aVNot because it's monotone and concrete,
p186
aVbut because of what it symbolizes:
p187
aVa monster that feeds off the rest of the country,
p188
aVwhere citizens are soldiers and slaves.
p189
aVAll I see there is darkness.
p190
aVBut it's your home, so I cannot hate it.
p191
aVAnd I hope instead that you, my lovely young gentlemen,
p192
aVwill one day help make it beautiful.
p193
aa(lp194
VThank you.
