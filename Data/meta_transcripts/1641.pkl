VSo I'd like to start by focusing on
p4
aVthe world's most dangerous animal.
p5
aa(lp6
VNow, when you talk about dangerous animals,
p7
aVmost people might think of lions or tigers or sharks.
p8
aVBut of course the most dangerous animal
p9
aVis the mosquito.
p10
aVThe mosquito has killed more humans
p11
aVthan any other creature in human history.
p12
aVIn fact, probably adding them all together,
p13
aVthe mosquito has killed more humans.
p14
aVAnd the mosquito has killed more humans than wars
p15
aVand plague.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd you would think, would you not,
p18
aVthat with all our science, with all our advances in society,
p19
aVwith better towns, better civilizations, better sanitation,
p20
aVwealth, that we would get better at controlling mosquitos,
p21
aVand hence reduce this disease.
p22
aVAnd that's not really the case.
p23
aVIf it was the case, we wouldn't have
p24
aVbetween 200 and 300 million cases of malaria every year,
p25
aVand we wouldn't have
p26
aVa million and a half deaths from malaria,
p27
aVand we wouldn't have a disease
p28
aVthat was relatively unknown 50 years ago
p29
aVnow suddenly turned into
p30
aVthe largest mosquito-borne virus threat that we have,
p31
aVand that's called dengue fever.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo 50 years ago, pretty much no one had heard of it,
p34
aVno one certainly in the European environment.
p35
aVBut dengue fever now, according to the World Health Organization,
p36
aVinfects between 50 and 100 million people every year,
p37
aVso that's equivalent to the whole of the population
p38
aVof the U.K. being infected every year.
p39
aVOther estimates put that number at roughly double
p40
aVthat number of infections.
p41
aVAnd dengue fever has grown in speed quite phenomenally.
p42
aVIn the last 50 years, the incidence of dengue
p43
aVhas grown thirtyfold.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow let me tell you a little bit about what dengue fever is,
p46
aVfor those who don't know.
p47
aVNow let's assume you go on holiday.
p48
aVLet's assume you go to the Caribbean,
p49
aVor you might go to Mexico. You might go to Latin America,
p50
aVAsia, Africa, anywhere in Saudi Arabia.
p51
aVYou might go to India, the Far East.
p52
aVIt doesn't really matter. It's the same mosquito,
p53
aVand it's the same disease. You're at risk.
p54
aVAnd let's assume you're bitten by a mosquito
p55
aVthat's carrying that virus.
p56
aVWell, you could develop flu-like symptoms.
p57
aVThey could be quite mild.
p58
aVYou could develop nausea, headache,
p59
aVyour muscles could feel like they're contracting,
p60
aVand you could actually feel like your bones are breaking.
p61
aVAnd that's the nickname given to this disease.
p62
aVIt's called breakbone fever,
p63
aVbecause that's how you can feel.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow the odd thing is, is that once you've been bitten
p66
aVby this mosquito, and you've had this disease,
p67
aVyour body develops antibodies,
p68
aVso if you're bitten again with that strain,
p69
aVit doesn't affect you.
p70
aVBut it's not one virus, it's four,
p71
aVand the same protection that gives you the antibodies
p72
aVand protects you from the same virus that you had before
p73
aVactually makes you much more susceptible to the other three.
p74
aVSo the next time you get dengue fever,
p75
aVif it's a different strain, you're more susceptible,
p76
aVyou're likely to get worse symptoms,
p77
aVand you're more likely to get the more severe forms,
p78
aVhemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome.
p79
aVSo you don't want dengue once,
p80
aVand you certainly don't want it again.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo why is it spreading so fast?
p83
aVAnd the answer is this thing.
p84
aVThis is Aedes aegypti.
p85
aVNow this is a mosquito that came, like its name suggests,
p86
aVout of North Africa, and it's spread round the world.
p87
aVNow, in fact, a single mosquito will only travel
p88
aVabout 200 yards in its entire life. They don't travel very far.
p89
aVWhat they're very good at doing is hitchhiking,
p90
aVparticularly the eggs.
p91
aVThey will lay their eggs in clear water, any pool, any puddle,
p92
aVany birdbath, any flower pot,
p93
aVanywhere there's clear water, they'll lay their eggs,
p94
aVand if that clear water is near freight, it's near a port,
p95
aVif it's anywhere near transport,
p96
aVthose eggs will then get transported around the world.
p97
aVAnd that's what's happened. Mankind has transported
p98
aVthese eggs all the way around the world,
p99
aVand these insects have infested over 100 countries,
p100
aVand there's now 2.5 billion people living in countries
p101
aVwhere this mosquito resides.
p102
aa(lp103
VTo give you just a couple of examples
p104
aVhow fast this has happened,
p105
aVin the mid-'70s, Brazil declared, "We have no Aedes aegypti,"
p106
aVand currently they spend about a billion dollars now
p107
aVa year trying to get rid of it, trying to control it,
p108
aVjust one species of mosquito.
p109
aVTwo days ago, or yesterday, I can't remember which,
p110
aVI saw a Reuters report that said
p111
aVMadeira had had their first cases of dengue,
p112
aVabout 52 cases, with about 400 probable cases.
p113
aVThat's two days ago.
p114
aVInterestingly, Madeira first got the insect in 2005,
p115
aVand here we are, a few years later,
p116
aVfirst cases of dengue.
p117
aVSo the one thing you'll find is that where the mosquito goes,
p118
aVdengue will follow.
p119
aVOnce you've got the mosquito in your area,
p120
aVanyone coming into that area with dengue,
p121
aVmosquito will bite them, mosquito will bite somewhere else,
p122
aVsomewhere else, somewhere else,
p123
aVand you'll get an epidemic.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo we must be good at killing mosquitos.
p126
aVI mean, that can't be very difficult.
p127
aVWell, there's two principle ways.
p128
aVThe first way is that you use larvicides.
p129
aVYou use chemicals. You put them into water where they breed.
p130
aVNow in an urban environment, that's extraordinarily difficult.
p131
aVYou've got to get your chemical into every puddle,
p132
aVevery birdbath, every tree trunk.
p133
aVIt's just not practical.
p134
aVThe second way you can do it
p135
aVis actually trying to kill the insects as they fly around.
p136
aVThis is a picture of fogging.
p137
aVHere what someone is doing
p138
aVis mixing up chemical in a smoke
p139
aVand basically spreading that through the environment.
p140
aVYou could do the same with a space spray.
p141
aVThis is really unpleasant stuff,
p142
aVand if it was any good, we wouldn't have this massive increase
p143
aVin mosquitos and we wouldn't have this massive increase in dengue fever.
p144
aVSo it's not very effective, but it's probably
p145
aVthe best thing we've got at the moment.
p146
aVHaving said that, actually, your best form of protection
p147
aVand my best form of protection is a long-sleeve shirt
p148
aVand a little bit of DEET to go with it.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo let's start again. Let's design a product,
p151
aVright from the word go, and decide what we want.
p152
aVWell we clearly need something that is effective
p153
aVat reducing the mosquito population.
p154
aVThere's no point in just killing the odd mosquito here and there.
p155
aVWe want something that gets that population right the way down
p156
aVso it can't get the disease transmission.
p157
aVClearly the product you've got has got to be safe to humans.
p158
aVWe are going to use it in and around humans.
p159
aVIt has to be safe.
p160
aVWe don't want to have a lasting impact on the environment.
p161
aVWe don't want to do anything that you can't undo.
p162
aVMaybe a better product comes along in 20, 30 years.
p163
aVFine. We don't want a lasting environmental impact.
p164
aVWe want something that's relatively cheap, or cost-effective,
p165
aVbecause there's an awful lot of countries involved,
p166
aVand some of them are emerging markets,
p167
aVsome of them emerging countries, low-income.
p168
aVAnd finally, you want something that's species-specific.
p169
aVYou want to get rid of this mosquito that spreads dengue,
p170
aVbut you don't really want to get all the other insects.
p171
aVSome are quite beneficial. Some are important to your ecosystem.
p172
aVThis one's not. It's invaded you.
p173
aVBut you don't want to get all of the insects.
p174
aVYou just want to get this one.
p175
aVAnd most of the time, you'll find this insect
p176
aVlives in and around your home,
p177
aVso this \u2014 whatever we do has got to get to that insect.
p178
aVIt's got to get into people's houses, into the bedrooms,
p179
aVinto the kitchens.
p180
aa(lp181
VNow there are two features of mosquito biology
p182
aVthat really help us in this project,
p183
aVand that is, firstly, males don't bite.
p184
aVIt's only the female mosquito that will actually bite you.
p185
aVThe male can't bite you, won't bite you,
p186
aVdoesn't have the mouth parts to bite you.
p187
aVIt's just the female.
p188
aVAnd the second is a phenomenon
p189
aVthat males are very, very good at finding females.
p190
aVIf there's a male mosquito that you release,
p191
aVand if there's a female around, that male will find the female.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo basically, we've used those two factors.
p194
aVSo here's a typical situation,
p195
aVmale meets female, lots of offspring.
p196
aVA single female will lay about
p197
aVup to 100 eggs at a time,
p198
aVup to about 500 in her lifetime.
p199
aVNow if that male is carrying a gene
p200
aVwhich causes the death of the offspring,
p201
aVthen the offspring don't survive,
p202
aVand instead of having 500 mosquitos running around,
p203
aVyou have none.
p204
aVAnd if you can put more, I'll call them sterile,
p205
aVthat the offspring will actually die at different stages,
p206
aVbut I'll call them sterile for now.
p207
aVIf you put more sterile males out into the environment,
p208
aVthen the females are more likely to find a sterile male
p209
aVthan a fertile one, and you will bring that population down.
p210
aVSo the males will go out, they'll look for females,
p211
aVthey'll mate. If they mate successfully, then no offspring.
p212
aVIf they don't find a female, then they'll die anyway.
p213
aVThey only live a few days.
p214
aa(lp215
VAnd that's exactly where we are.
p216
aVSo this is technology that was developed
p217
aVin Oxford University a few years ago.
p218
aVThe company itself, Oxitec, we've been working
p219
aVfor the last 10 years, very much on a sort of similar
p220
aVdevelopment pathway that you'd get with a pharmaceutical company.
p221
aVSo about 10 years of internal evaluation, testing,
p222
aVto get this to a state where we think it's actually ready.
p223
aVAnd then we've gone out into the big outdoors,
p224
aValways with local community consent,
p225
aValways with the necessary permits.
p226
aVSo we've done field trials now in the Cayman Islands,
p227
aVa small one in Malaysia,
p228
aVand two more now in Brazil.
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd what's the result?
p231
aVWell, the result has been very good.
p232
aVIn about four months of release,
p233
aVwe've brought that population of mosquitos
p234
aV\u2014 in most cases we're dealing with villages here
p235
aVof about 2,000, 3,000 people, that sort of size,
p236
aVstarting small \u2014
p237
aVwe've taken that mosquito population down
p238
aVby about 85 percent in about four months.
p239
aVAnd in fact, the numbers after that get,
p240
aVthose get very difficult to count, because there just aren't any left.
p241
aVSo that's been what we've seen in Cayman,
p242
aVit's been what we've seen in Brazil
p243
aVin those trials.
p244
aa(lp245
VAnd now what we're doing is we're going through a process
p246
aVto scale up to a town of about 50,000,
p247
aVso we can see this work at big scale.
p248
aVAnd we've got a production unit in Oxford,
p249
aVor just south of Oxford, where we actually produce these mosquitos.
p250
aVWe can produce them,
p251
aVin a space a bit more than this red carpet,
p252
aVI can produce about 20 million a week.
p253
aVWe can transport them around the world.
p254
aVIt's not very expensive, because it's a coffee cup \u2014
p255
aVsomething the size of a coffee cup
p256
aVwill hold about three million eggs.
p257
aVSo freight costs aren't our biggest problem. (Laughter)
p258
aVSo we've got that. You could call it a mosquito factory.
p259
aVAnd for Brazil, where we've been doing some trials,
p260
aVthe Brazilian government themselves have now built
p261
aVtheir own mosquito factory, far bigger than ours,
p262
aVand we'll use that for scaling up in Brazil.
p263
aa(lp264
VThere you are. We've sent mosquito eggs.
p265
aVWe've separated the males from the females.
p266
aVThe males have been put in little pots
p267
aVand the truck is going down the road
p268
aVand they are releasing males as they go.
p269
aVIt's actually a little bit more precise than that.
p270
aVYou want to release them so that
p271
aVyou get good coverage of your area.
p272
aVSo you take a Google Map, you divide it up,
p273
aVwork out how far they can fly,
p274
aVand make sure you're releasing such that you get
p275
aVcoverage of the area, and then you go back,
p276
aVand within a very short space of time,
p277
aVyou're bringing that population right the way down.
p278
aa(lp279
VWe've also done this in agriculture.
p280
aVWe've got several different species of agriculture coming along,
p281
aVand I'm hoping that soon
p282
aVwe'll be able to get some funding together so we can get back
p283
aVand start looking at malaria.
p284
aa(lp285
VSo that's where we stand at the moment,
p286
aVand I've just got a few final thoughts,
p287
aVwhich is that this is another way in which biology
p288
aVis now coming in to supplement chemistry
p289
aVin some of our societal advances in this area,
p290
aVand these biological approaches are coming in
p291
aVin very different forms,
p292
aVand when you think about genetic engineering,
p293
aVwe've now got enzymes for industrial processing,
p294
aVenzymes, genetically engineered enzymes in food.
p295
aVWe have G.M. crops, we have pharmaceuticals,
p296
aVwe have new vaccines,
p297
aVall using roughly the same technology, but with very different outcomes.
p298
aVAnd I'm in favor, actually. Of course I am.
p299
aVI'm in favor of particularly where the older technologies
p300
aVdon't work well or have become unacceptable.
p301
aVAnd although the techniques are similar,
p302
aVthe outcomes are very, very different,
p303
aVand if you take our approach, for example,
p304
aVand you compare it to, say, G.M. crops,
p305
aVboth techniques are trying to produce a massive benefit.
p306
aVBoth have a side benefit,
p307
aVwhich is that we reduce pesticide use tremendously.
p308
aVBut whereas a G.M. crop is trying to protect the plant,
p309
aVfor example, and give it an advantage,
p310
aVwhat we're actually doing is taking the mosquito
p311
aVand giving it the biggest disadvantage it can possibly have,
p312
aVrendering it unable to reproduce effectively.
p313
aVSo for the mosquito, it's a dead end.
p314
aa(lp315
