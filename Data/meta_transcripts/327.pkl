VMy favorite topic is
p4
aVshortcuts.
p5
aVThe master of shortcuts \u2014 it's, of course, nature.
p6
aVBut I will demonstrate
p7
aVdifferent ways to get
p8
aVrid of difficulties and go to the point,
p9
aVto find an answer
p10
aVprobably much quicker than Arthur did. So,
p11
aVfirst,
p12
aVwe violate the common sense,
p13
aVthe logic. All of you, if you hold your hand like this,
p14
aV90 degrees \u2014
p15
aVall of you. Not you.
p16
aVAll of you, right? Palm up.
p17
aVIf you do this,
p18
aVthe common, the logic says you must turn the wrist.
p19
aVDo you agree?
p20
aVGood.
p21
aVBut I will first teach you
p22
aVa method, how you can do it without
p23
aVmoving the wrist, and then the shortcut.
p24
aVYou can do it immediately, right?
p25
aVHold the hand like this, palm up.
p26
aVDon't move the wrist. The wrist is \u2014
p27
aVI doesn't speak very many, but I do the best, what I are.
p28
aVRight-molded you say, with iron?
p29
aVThat was a joke, actually,
p30
aVand I \u2014
p31
aVOK.
p32
aVHold the hand palm up. Do this, don't move the wrist.
p33
aVOver the heart, don't move the wrist.
p34
aVForward, don't move the wrist.
p35
aVUp, don't move the wrist. Over the heart, don't move the wrist.
p36
aVAnd forward. Yeah.
p37
aVNow \u2014
p38
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p39
aVlogic, logically,
p40
aVyou have got to this position from this, without moving the wrist.
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aVNow, the shortcut.
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aVBut it was six moves. Now with one move.
p45
aVI start here, palm down, you can follow.
p46
aVAnd then look at me.
p47
aVYeah! (Laughter)
p48
aVOne move. OK.
p49
aVSo,
p50
aVthat was the warming up.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow,
p53
aVI need an assistant.
p54
aVI talked to a nice girl before, Zoe.
p55
aVShe has left. No! A big hand.
p56
aV(Applause)
p57
aa(lp58
VGood. Nice. And you can sit over there.
p59
aVOne item here was water, right?
p60
aVAnd I will give my tribute
p61
aVto water.
p62
aVI think it's enough with water for me. The other guys can talk about \u2014 cheers.
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aVBeer has about \u2014
p65
aVthere's a lot of water in beer.
p66
aV(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VSo, now
p69
aVI will demonstrate different ways of
p70
aVmemorizing,
p71
aVcontrol cards and so on.
p72
aVAnd I think I'll take off this one.
p73
aVI work with a special
p74
aVmethod to do it, quick.
p75
aVI work with
p76
aVprecision \u2014 oh, sorry \u2014
p77
aVcontrol
p78
aVand
p79
aVa very powerful ...
p80
aVmemory system, right?
p81
aV(Laughter)
p82
aVSo,
p83
aVif \u2014
p84
aVI have studied the poker. I like to gamble.
p85
aVOfficially, I don't gamble but ...
p86
aVSo, if we are \u2014
p87
aVif we have five person,
p88
aVand I will do a five-handed poker game.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow I will interact. So a different person
p91
aVall the time, so not the same person can answer.
p92
aVSo we have an agreement.
p93
aVWhich one shall have a good poker hand?
p94
aVWhich number? One, two, three, four or five? (Audience: Three.)
p95
aa(lp96
VLennart Green: Three \u2014 good.
p97
aVAnd
p98
aVhere,
p99
aVI had a mat here to make it a little \u2014
p100
aVthe critical moment is \u2014 sorry.
p101
aVIf a card shark gathers the cards together,
p102
aVimmediately when he \u2014
p103
aVbefore he deals the card. Now,
p104
aVso I think, number three,
p105
aVI have arranged them in a full house.
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVWith queens and \u2014 it's OK \u2014
p108
aVqueens and tens.
p109
aVThat's a challenge. I like this.
p110
aVI will explain later. One, two, three, four, five.
p111
aVI start with three queens.
p112
aVSo here you see the contrast when I treat the cards.
p113
aVAnd two tens.
p114
aVYeah. Thank you.
p115
aV(Applause)
p116
aVBut also the other hand is good, if all the other guys have good hands too.
p117
aVSo these guys have actually a stronger hand \u2014
p118
aVthree aces and two kings.
p119
aVThis guy beats them with
p120
aVfour of a kind, or deuce \u2014 deuce.
p121
aVNo reaction? That with even \u2014
p122
aVOK, and this.
p123
aVThese look in order, I'm probably \u2014 hopefully \u2014
p124
aVyeah. Three, four, five, six, seven
p125
aVand ...
p126
aVBut, of course, I will have the winning hand.
p127
aVTen, jack,
p128
aVqueen, king, ace.
p129
aVYeah. So,
p130
aVgood.
p131
aV(Laughter)
p132
aVSo the hand that looks so good from the beginning,
p133
aVnumber three, at the end
p134
aVwas actually the lowest hand.
p135
aVSuch life. Right?
p136
aa(lp137
VSo, please mix them.
p138
aVNow, if you are interested, I will demonstrate some
p139
aVunderground techniques.
p140
aVYes?
p141
aVI work with
p142
aVkind of estimation,
p143
aVshuffle tracking \u2014
p144
aVah, good.
p145
aVImpressive. Thank you.
p146
aV(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VSo, first,
p149
aVthe first term is estimation.
p150
aVHere, I can estimate exactly how many cards
p151
aVare put between
p152
aVmy royal flush.
p153
aVOf course, I can count the cards, but this is much quicker.
p154
aVRight? You agree.
p155
aVSo here I have, actually \u2014
p156
aVI know exactly where the cards are.
p157
aVSo here, I can make a bet,
p158
aVand this is actually one of the points where I get my money.
p159
aVSo here: 10, jack,
p160
aVqueen, king, ace.
p161
aVOK.
p162
aV(Applause)
p163
aa(lp164
VNext
p165
aVis a term \u2014
p166
aVI do it quick. I call this stealing.
p167
aVSo here, I think
p168
aVI know about where the cards are.
p169
aVI will spread the cards and you'll say stop,
p170
aVwhen I point to them, right. Point, say stop.
p171
aa(lp172
VZoe: Stop.
p173
aa(lp174
VLG: Here \u2014 you see some are missing?
p175
aVAnd that's the stealing cards, which I did.
p176
aV(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VOK.
p179
aVNow, another term called shuffle tracking.
p180
aVShuffle tracking means I keep track of the cards,
p181
aVeven if another person shuffles.
p182
aVThis is a little risky.
p183
aVSo \u2014 because if you look, now, I can still see it.
p184
aVYou agree? But if you square \u2014
p185
aVsquare, and shuffle,
p186
aVand then a cut.
p187
aVSo here,
p188
aVto follow my cards, I must look at the shuffle from the begin \u2014
p189
aVah, we are started together. It's OK, it's OK.
p190
aVCome to \u2014 no, no, no, no.
p191
aVI'm joking, yeah?
p192
aVAny style \u2014 yeah, good.
p193
aVHere I have to calculate, but actually, I don't like to calculate.
p194
aVI work direct with the right brain.
p195
aVIf you pass the left brain,
p196
aVyou have to take care of logic and common sense.
p197
aVDirect in the right brain, that's much better. And so \u2014
p198
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p199
aVArthur Benjamin did
p200
aVa little of the same thing.
p201
aVAnd if you work with, in the right atmosphere, with humor,
p202
aVyou have \u2014 that's the password
p203
aVto the
p204
aVcosmic bank of knowledge,
p205
aVwhere you can find any solution of any problem.
p206
aa(lp207
VOK. Now, I drop the cards,
p208
aVand you say stop anyway, right?
p209
aVNot at the last card.
p210
aa(lp211
VZoe: Stop. LG: Yeah.
p212
aa(lp213
VWhen I'm sober, I do this much quicker, but we will check.
p214
aV(Laughter)
p215
aVAh, not in order, it \u2014 that was a mistake.
p216
aVNo, I'm kidding.
p217
aV(Applause)
p218
aVNo, now and then I put in a mistake,
p219
aVjust to emphasize how difficult it is.
p220
aVRight?
p221
aVYeah, last night I forgot that. That was a mistake.
p222
aVBut now I'm glad I remember it.
p223
aVSo,
p224
aVthis deck is bought here. Sorry.
p225
aVI have a little pad
p226
aVto make it a little softer.
p227
aVThis deck is bought here in America.
p228
aVIt's called
p229
aV"Bicycle." And this deck is very flexible,
p230
aVbut not so many people know,
p231
aVif you check, if you press at
p232
aVthe right spots,
p233
aVyou see how thin and flexible this deck is, right?
p234
aVNow, you can carry this in your wallet,
p235
aVso ...
p236
aVYou don't see it, make no reaction?
p237
aV(Laughter)
p238
aVSo, but here,
p239
aVand \u2014
p240
aVis the camera getting too much? No.
p241
aV(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VYeah? (Audience: It's getting too much.)
p244
aa(lp245
VLG: Pardon? But then, when we will have it back, you do this.
p246
aVBut not too much.
p247
aVThen you have to push it down again.
p248
aVHere, please. If you push these
p249
aVheaps \u2014 everyone see \u2014
p250
aVpush them together so they are really interlaced,
p251
aVright? Yeah, good.
p252
aVPerfect.
p253
aVJust push them through, good. Thank you.
p254
aVAnd then, I will demonstrate a thing from
p255
aVRussian satellite,
p256
aVstealen \u2014 stolen,
p257
aVprobably copied from America but we will see.
p258
aa(lp259
VHere \u2014
p260
aVshortcuts. I talk about shortcuts.
p261
aVNow I go very quick
p262
aVthrough the deck and try to find some pattern.
p263
aVThe new chaos theory is already old, right?
p264
aVBut you know, I think you are
p265
aVfamiliar with fractals \u2014
p266
aVthe Mandelbrot spirals and all these things.
p267
aVAnd it's much
p268
aVeasier to memorize cards in a pattern way,
p269
aVand not concentrate. If you concentrate and calculate,
p270
aVthen you go to \u2014
p271
aVthen it's the left brain. But if you just look and talk
p272
aVin another language ...
p273
aVYeah, great.
p274
aVI think I have it.
p275
aa(lp276
VSo now, different persons, older, tap.
p277
aVPlease name any card, anyone.
p278
aa(lp279
V(Audience: Jack of spades.) LG: Jack of spades.
p280
aa(lp281
VJack of spades.
p282
aVI think jack of spades is number 12 from the top.
p283
aVOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
p284
aVnine, 10, 11,
p285
aV12. Yes, right.
p286
aVSo \u2014 oh, jack of spades.
p287
aa(lp288
VYou said spades? (Audience: Yes.) LG: Ah.
p289
aVMy fault. Don't applaud, this was clubs.
p290
aVSo, jack of spades.
p291
aVI think ...
p292
aV23 \u2014
p293
aV24, sorry, 24.
p294
aVOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
p295
aV10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
p296
aV18, 19, 20, 21, 22,
p297
aV23 \u2014
p298
aVah, 25, yes.
p299
aVIt's the last.
p300
aVNow, I do it quicker, better.
p301
aVOK. Another person. Oh, I forgot, I shouldn't shuffle but I think \u2014
p302
aV(Laughter)
p303
aV\u2014 actually, my technique is to peek,
p304
aVall the time.
p305
aVWhen I lift the heap, I peek.
p306
aVYou see, yeah, perfect.
p307
aVThree, four, five, six. Then I calculate \u2014 yeah, good.
p308
aV(Laughter)
p309
aa(lp310
VAnother person, another card. (Audience: Seven of diamonds.)
p311
aa(lp312
VLG: Seven of diamonds. Perfect, my favorite, yeah, seven.
p313
aVSo I will do it quick,
p314
aVvery quick, but in slow motion, so you can follow.
p315
aV(Laughter)
p316
aa(lp317
VSeven of? (Audience: Diamonds.)
p318
aa(lp319
VLG: Diamonds, good. I start here.
p320
aVGood, thank you.
p321
aV(Applause)
p322
aVThe thing I did \u2014 I peeked.
p323
aVI know where the card were,
p324
aVthen I chose it. So another person, another card.
p325
aV(Laughter)
p326
aVAnother person.
p327
aa(lp328
V(Audience: Ten of diamonds.)
p329
aVLG: Pardon?
p330
aV(Audience: Ten of diamonds.)
p331
aa(lp332
VLG: Ten of diamonds, yeah.
p333
aVI think I do it the same way. I like to,
p334
aVso I know where it is.
p335
aVTen of diamonds.
p336
aVBut now I do it the regular speed, right?
p337
aVTen of diamonds.
p338
aVGood.
p339
aVMaybe you will cut? Lift.
p340
aVExcellent.
p341
aVSo, thank you. Another person, another card.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Audience: Five of clubs.)
p344
aa(lp345
VLG: Pardon? (Audience: Five of clubs.)
p346
aa(lp347
VLG: Five of clubs. It's not the same person, even if it's the same spot.
p348
aVWe can take some over there later. So now, I will drop the cards.
p349
aVAnd you'll say stop, anywhere. Got it?
p350
aVFive of clubs.
p351
aVNot the last. Yes, that's difficult to find a card here.
p352
aV(Laughter)
p353
aVWe do it again.
p354
aVThe person who said five of clubs say stop,
p355
aVwhen the cards are in the air, right?
p356
aa(lp357
V(Audience: Stop.)
p358
aa(lp359
VLG: Very good.
p360
aVOK.
p361
aV(Applause)
p362
aa(lp363
VOK, I had to use a little force there.
p364
aVI think we save five of clubs.
p365
aVAnd now a card with a contrast of five of clubs.
p366
aa(lp367
V(Audience: Queen of hearts.) LG: Queen of hearts, yeah.
p368
aVExcellent. I love that card.
p369
aVHere, I will do the most difficult thing.
p370
aVFor example, you are sitting in Las Vegas,
p371
aVand you're betting,
p372
aVand you let the other guys
p373
aVpeek this card by mistake. Feel, it's just the regular, one card.
p374
aVAnd now, when I lift this card,
p375
aVit shall be your card. What was your card?
p376
aa(lp377
V(Audience: Queen of hearts.)
p378
aa(lp379
VLG: Queen of? Queen of hearts.
p380
aVSo that's a tough challenge, right?
p381
aVSo here, I grab \u2014
p382
aVyou know this? Five of clubs ...
p383
aVand queen of hearts. Yes!
p384
aVThis is a tough one,
p385
aVbecause here I must take advantage of \u2014
p386
aVI switch it with the five of clubs.
p387
aVSo, now
p388
aVa false count.
p389
aVWhich card shall I use? Queen or five?
p390
aa(lp391
VZoe: The queen. LG: Queen, yes.
p392
aa(lp393
VSo, I use the queen, and here's five of clubs.
p394
aVThe false count \u2014 and the number
p395
aVone, two, three,
p396
aVfour, five, six, seven, eight \u2014
p397
aVyou say the same card all the time.
p398
aVEight, nine, 10.
p399
aVThis is a kind of optical deal, right?
p400
aVWhen I put one card at a table \u2014
p401
aVlook, it's not one card. It's \u2014 look,
p402
aVit's a bunch of cards that gives this
p403
aVimpression.
p404
aVYeah.
p405
aVNow some hard stuff.
p406
aVI think we keep the queen here, yes.
p407
aVNow, to the satellites things.
p408
aVThis \u2014
p409
aVoh sorry, don't look at the beam. My fault.
p410
aV(Laughter)
p411
aa(lp412
VThis is high-frequency laser,
p413
aVand it's enough with a fraction of a second
p414
aVto destroy the retina completely.
p415
aVRight, sorry, my \u2014 I should have mentioned that, yeah.
p416
aVBut you can relax,
p417
aVbecause it takes half an hour before it works,
p418
aVso you have plenty of time to see my whole performance.
p419
aV(Laughter)
p420
aVNow,
p421
aVI put the laser here,
p422
aVand \u2014
p423
aVnow, when I deal the cards in the laser,
p424
aVI know where they are but \u2014 yes?
p425
aVDid the camera got it?
p426
aVNo?
p427
aVThey didn't?
p428
aVWhat happened?
p429
aa(lp430
V(Audience: It disappeared.)
p431
aa(lp432
VLG: OK, I'll take another group.
p433
aVDo the cameras see the cards now?
p434
aa(lp435
VNo? (Audience: No, they're all gone.)
p436
aa(lp437
VLG: But you see the hand.
p438
aVAh, good, good, good. But now.
p439
aVSo now, that was the reason, right?
p440
aVYou see the cards? Yes.
p441
aV(Laughter)
p442
aVYeah, good.
p443
aVNow \u2014
p444
aV(Laughter)
p445
aV\u2014 one guy laughed. So now, to find the queen,
p446
aVdo it this way: take back the other one, take back the queen.
p447
aV(Laughter)
p448
aVYeah, interesting,
p449
aVbut a little dangerous.
p450
aV(Laughter)
p451
aVI liked it. Now,
p452
aVa little more difficult.
p453
aVName \u2014 anyone, name, please, any suit.
p454
aa(lp455
V(Audience: Spades.) LG: Spades? Spades, good.
p456
aa(lp457
VSo here,
p458
aVhere I have to peek, lots of cards.
p459
aVI think there are lots of \u2014
p460
aVI don't know how many \u2014 but 10, 15 spades in a deck, at least, right?
p461
aV(Laughter)
p462
aVSo every time I lift the heap, I peek, right.
p463
aVThen I arrange them so I can
p464
aVget them quick.
p465
aVPerfect, excellent.
p466
aVSo I start with the ace \u2014
p467
aVyeah, ace. Ah, yeah \u2014 spades?
p468
aVSame mistake as before, right?
p469
aVSo \u2014 I arrange the spades \u2014 the clubs.
p470
aVI try to do this right here. First, I take the spades.
p471
aVYou see, I don't work with prestige,
p472
aVso always do mistakes.
p473
aVIt doesn't matter to me.
p474
aVAnd now and then, I get some extra sympathy points, right?
p475
aVOne,
p476
aVtwo, three, four \u2014 yes,
p477
aVthe camera got it? Five, six,
p478
aVseven, eight \u2014
p479
aVah \u2014
p480
aVnine, 10,
p481
aVthe jack,

p548
aVI have to figure out so many outs,
p549
aVwhen I miss some cards, but
p550
aVI love it. So now,
p551
aVI will do it. I will try to find
p552
aVthe diamonds,
p553
aVbut I will do it the hard way.
p554
aVIt's too easy to do it right away, right?
p555
