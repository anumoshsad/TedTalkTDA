VWhen I was President of the American Psychological Association,
p4
aVthey tried to media-train me.
p5
aVAnd an encounter I had with CNN summarizes
p6
aVwhat I'm going to be talking about today,
p7
aVwhich is the eleventh reason to be optimistic.
p8
aVThe editor of Discover told us 10 of them;
p9
aVI'm going to give you the eleventh.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo they came to me, CNN, and they said, "Professor Seligman \u2014
p12
aVwould you tell us about the state of psychology today?
p13
aVWe'd like to interview you about that."
p14
aVAnd I said, "Great."
p15
aVAnd she said, "But this is CNN, so you only get a sound bite."
p16
aVI said, "Well, how many words do I get?"
p17
aVAnd she said, "Well, one."
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd the cameras rolled, and she said,
p22
aV"Professor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?"
p23
aV"Good."
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
V"Cut! Cut. That won't do.
p28
aVWe'd really better give you a longer sound bite."
p29
aV"How many words do I get this time?"
p30
aV"Well, you get two."
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
V"Doctor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?"
p35
aV"Not good."
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
V"Look, Doctor Seligman,
p40
aVwe can see you're really not comfortable in this medium.
p41
aVWe'd better give you a real sound bite.
p42
aVThis time you can have three words.
p43
aVProfessor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?"
p44
aV"Not good enough."
p45
aVThat's what I'm going to be talking about.
p46
aa(lp47
VI want to say why psychology was good, why it was not good,
p48
aVand how it may become, in the next 10 years, good enough.
p49
aVAnd by parallel summary, I want to say the same thing about technology,
p50
aVabout entertainment and design,
p51
aVbecause I think the issues are very similar.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo, why was psychology good?
p54
aVWell, for more than 60 years, psychology worked within the disease model.
p55
aVTen years ago, when I was on an airplane
p56
aVand I introduced myself to my seatmate, and told them what I did,
p57
aVthey'd move away from me,
p58
aVbecause, quite rightly, they were saying
p59
aVpsychology is about finding what's wrong with you.
p60
aVSpot the loony.
p61
aVAnd now, when I tell people what I do, they move toward me.
p62
aa(lp63
VWhat was good about psychology \u2014
p64
aVabout the $30 billion investment NIMH made,
p65
aVabout working in the disease model,
p66
aVabout what you mean by psychology \u2014
p67
aVis that, 60 years ago, none of the disorders were treatable;
p68
aVit was entirely smoke and mirrors.
p69
aVAnd now, 14 of the disorders are treatable,
p70
aVtwo of them actually curable.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd the other thing that happened is that a science developed,
p73
aVa science of mental illness.
p74
aVWe found out we could take fuzzy concepts
p75
aVlike depression, alcoholism,
p76
aVand measure them with rigor;
p77
aVthat we could create a classification of the mental illnesses;
p78
aVthat we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses.
p79
aVWe could look across time at the same people \u2014
p80
aVpeople, for example, who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia \u2014
p81
aVand ask what the contribution of mothering, of genetics are,
p82
aVand we could isolate third variables
p83
aVby doing experiments on the mental illnesses.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd best of all, we were able, in the last 50 years,
p86
aVto invent drug treatments and psychological treatments.
p87
aVAnd then we were able to test them rigorously,
p88
aVin random-assignment, placebo-controlled designs,
p89
aVthrow out the things that didn't work,
p90
aVkeep the things that actively did.
p91
aa(lp92
VThe conclusion of that is,
p93
aVpsychology and psychiatry of the last 60 years
p94
aVcan actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable.
p95
aVAnd I think that's terrific.
p96
aVI'm proud of it.
p97
aVBut what was not good, the consequences of that,
p98
aVwere three things.
p99
aa(lp100
VThe first was moral;
p101
aVthat psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists, pathologizers;
p102
aVthat our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble,
p103
aVbricks fell on you.
p104
aVAnd we forgot that people made choices and decisions.
p105
aVWe forgot responsibility.
p106
aVThat was the first cost.
p107
aa(lp108
VThe second cost was that we forgot about you people.
p109
aVWe forgot about improving normal lives.
p110
aVWe forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier,
p111
aVmore fulfilled, more productive.
p112
aVAnd "genius," "high-talent," became a dirty word.
p113
aVNo one works on that.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd the third problem about the disease model is,
p116
aVin our rush to do something about people in trouble,
p117
aVin our rush to do something about repairing damage,
p118
aVit never occurred to us to develop interventions
p119
aVto make people happier \u2014 positive interventions.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo that was not good.
p122
aVAnd so that's what led people like Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert,
p123
aVMike Csikszentmihalyi and myself
p124
aVto work in something I call, "positive psychology,"
p125
aVwhich has three aims.
p126
aVThe first is that psychology should be just as concerned
p127
aVwith human strength as it is with weakness.
p128
aVIt should be just as concerned with building strength
p129
aVas with repairing damage.
p130
aVIt should be interested in the best things in life.
p131
aVAnd it should be just as concerned
p132
aVwith making the lives of normal people fulfilling,
p133
aVand with genius, with nurturing high talent.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo in the last 10 years and the hope for the future,
p136
aVwe've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology,
p137
aVa science of what makes life worth living.
p138
aVIt turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness.
p139
aVAnd any of you, for free, can go to that website \u2014
p140
aa(lp141
V[www.authentichappiness.org]
p142
aa(lp143
Vand take the entire panoply of tests of happiness.
p144
aVYou can ask, how do you stack up for positive emotion, for meaning,
p145
aVfor flow, against literally tens of thousands of other people?
p146
aVWe created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities:
p147
aVa classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex ratio,
p148
aVhow they're defined, how to diagnose them,
p149
aVwhat builds them and what gets in their way.
p150
aVWe found that we could discover the causation of the positive states,
p151
aVthe relationship between left hemispheric activity
p152
aVand right hemispheric activity, as a cause of happiness.
p153
aa(lp154
VI've spent my life working on extremely miserable people,
p155
aVand I've asked the question:
p156
aVHow do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you?
p157
aVAnd starting about six years ago, we asked about extremely happy people.
p158
aVHow do they differ from the rest of us?
p159
aVIt turns out there's one way, very surprising \u2014
p160
aVthey're not more religious, they're not in better shape,
p161
aVthey don't have more money, they're not better looking,
p162
aVthey don't have more good events and fewer bad events.
p163
aVThe one way in which they differ: they're extremely social.
p164
aVThey don't sit in seminars on Saturday morning.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VThey don't spend time alone.
p169
aVEach of them is in a romantic relationship
p170
aVand each has a rich repertoire of friends.
p171
aa(lp172
VBut watch out here \u2014 this is merely correlational data, not causal,
p173
aVand it's about happiness in the first, "Hollywood" sense,
p174
aVI'm going to talk about,
p175
aVhappiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer.
p176
aVAnd I'm going to suggest to you that's not nearly enough,
p177
aVin just a moment.
p178
aVWe found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries,
p179
aVfrom the Buddha to Tony Robbins.
p180
aVAbout 120 interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy.
p181
aVAnd we find that we've been able to manualize many of them,
p182
aVand we actually carry out
p183
aVrandom-assignment efficacy and effectiveness studies.
p184
aVThat is, which ones actually make people lastingly happier?
p185
aVIn a couple of minutes, I'll tell you about some of those results.
p186
aa(lp187
VBut the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have,
p188
aVin addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill,
p189
aVand in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable,
p190
aVis, can psychology actually make people happier?
p191
aVAnd to ask that question \u2014 "happy" is not a word I use very much \u2014
p192
aVwe've had to break it down
p193
aVinto what I think is askable about "happy."
p194
aVAnd I believe there are three different \u2014
p195
aVI call them "different" because different interventions build them,
p196
aVit's possible to have one rather than the other \u2014
p197
aVthree different happy lives.
p198
aVThe first happy life is the pleasant life.
p199
aVThis is a life in which you have as much positive emotion
p200
aVas you possibly can,
p201
aVand the skills to amplify it.
p202
aVThe second is a life of engagement:
p203
aVa life in your work, your parenting, your love, your leisure;
p204
aVtime stops for you.
p205
aVThat's what Aristotle was talking about.
p206
aVAnd third, the meaningful life.
p207
aVI want to say a little bit about each of those lives
p208
aVand what we know about them.
p209
aa(lp210
VThe first life is the pleasant life, and it's simply, as best we can find it,
p211
aVit's having as many of the pleasures as you can,
p212
aVas much positive emotion as you can,
p213
aVand learning the skills \u2014 savoring, mindfulness \u2014 that amplify them,
p214
aVthat stretch them over time and space.
p215
aVBut the pleasant life has three drawbacks,
p216
aVand it's why positive psychology is not happy-ology,
p217
aVand why it doesn't end here.
p218
aa(lp219
VThe first drawback is, it turns out the pleasant life,
p220
aVyour experience of positive emotion,
p221
aVis about 50 percent heritable,
p222
aVand, in fact, not very modifiable.
p223
aVSo the different tricks that Matthieu and I and others know
p224
aVabout increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life
p225
aVare 15 to 20 percent tricks, getting more of it.
p226
aVSecond is that positive emotion habituates.
p227
aVIt habituates rapidly, indeed.
p228
aVIt's all like French vanilla ice cream:
p229
aVthe first taste is 100 percent;
p230
aVby the time you're down to the sixth taste,
p231
aVit's gone.
p232
aVAnd, as I said, it's not particularly malleable.
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd this leads to the second life.
p235
aVI have to tell you about my friend Len,
p236
aVto talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion,
p237
aVmore than building pleasure.
p238
aVIn two of the three great arenas of life, by the time Len was 30,
p239
aVLen was enormously successful.
p240
aVThe first arena was work.
p241
aVBy the time he was 20, he was an options trader.
p242
aVBy the time he was 25, he was a multimillionaire
p243
aVand the head of an options trading company.
p244
aVSecond, in play, he's a national champion bridge player.
p245
aVBut in the third great arena of life, love, Len is an abysmal failure.
p246
aVAnd the reason he was, was that Len is a cold fish.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
VLen is an introvert.
p251
aVAmerican women said to Len, when he dated them,
p252
aV"You're no fun. You don't have positive emotion. Get lost."
p253
aVAnd Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst,
p254
aVwho for five years tried to find the sexual trauma
p255
aVthat had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him.
p256
aVBut it turned out there wasn't any sexual trauma.
p257
aVIt turned out that \u2014
p258
aVLen grew up in Long Island
p259
aVand he played football and watched football, and played bridge.
p260
aVLen is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities.
p261
aa(lp262
VThe question is: Is Len unhappy?
p263
aVAnd I want to say, not.
p264
aVContrary to what psychology told us
p265
aVabout the bottom 50 percent of the human race in positive affectivity,
p266
aVI think Len is one of the happiest people I know.
p267
aVHe's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness,
p268
aVand that's because Len, like most of you,
p269
aVis enormously capable of flow.
p270
aVWhen he walks onto the floor of the American Exchange
p271
aVat 9:30 in the morning,
p272
aVtime stops for him.
p273
aVAnd it stops till the closing bell.
p274
aVWhen the first card is played till 10 days later,
p275
aVwhen the tournament is over,
p276
aVtime stops for Len.
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi
p279
aVhas been talking about, about flow.
p280
aVAnd it's distinct from pleasure in a very important way:
p281
aVpleasure has raw feel \u2014 you know it's happening; it's thought and feeling.
p282
aVBut what Mike told you yesterday \u2014 during flow ...
p283
aVyou can't feel anything.
p284
aVYou're one with the music.
p285
aVTime stops.
p286
aVYou have intense concentration.
p287
aVAnd this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life.
p288
aVAnd we think there's a recipe for it,
p289
aVand it's knowing what your highest strengths are \u2014
p290
aVagain, there's a valid test
p291
aVof what your five highest strengths are \u2014
p292
aVand then re-crafting your life
p293
aVto use them as much as you possibly can.
p294
aVRe-crafting your work, your love,
p295
aVyour play, your friendship, your parenting.
p296
aa(lp297
VJust one example.
p298
aVOne person I worked with was a bagger at Genuardi's.
p299
aVHated the job.
p300
aVShe's working her way through college.
p301
aVHer highest strength was social intelligence.
p302
aVSo she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her
p303
aVthe social highlight of every customer's day.
p304
aVNow, obviously she failed.
p305
aVBut what she did was to take her highest strengths,
p306
aVand re-craft work to use them as much as possible.
p307
aVWhat you get out of that is not smiley-ness.
p308
aVYou don't look like Debbie Reynolds.
p309
aVYou don't giggle a lot.
p310
aVWhat you get is more absorption.
p311
aa(lp312
VSo, that's the second path.
p313
aVThe first path, positive emotion;
p314
aVthe second path is eudaemonian flow;
p315
aVand the third path is meaning.
p316
aVThis is the most venerable of the happinesses, traditionally.
p317
aVAnd meaning, in this view, consists of \u2014
p318
aVvery parallel to eudaemonia \u2014
p319
aVit consists of knowing what your highest strengths are,
p320
aVand using them to belong to and in the service of
p321
aVsomething larger than you are.
p322
aa(lp323
VI mentioned that for all three kinds of lives \u2014
p324
aVthe pleasant life, the good life, the meaningful life \u2014
p325
aVpeople are now hard at work on the question:
p326
aVAre there things that lastingly change those lives?
p327
aVAnd the answer seems to be yes.
p328
aVAnd I'll just give you some samples of it.
p329
aVIt's being done in a rigorous manner.
p330
aVIt's being done in the same way that we test drugs
p331
aVto see what really works.
p332
aVSo we do random-assignment, placebo-controlled,
p333
aVlong-term studies of different interventions.
p334
aVJust to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect:
p335
aVwhen we teach people about the pleasant life,
p336
aVhow to have more pleasure in your life,
p337
aVone of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills,
p338
aVthe savoring skills,
p339
aVand you're assigned to design a beautiful day.
p340
aVNext Saturday, set a day aside, design yourself a beautiful day,
p341
aVand use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures.
p342
aVAnd we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced.
p343
aa(lp344
VGratitude visit.
p345
aVI want you all to do this with me now, if you would.
p346
aVClose your eyes.
p347
aVI'd like you to remember someone
p348
aVwho did something enormously important
p349
aVthat changed your life in a good direction,
p350
aVand who you never properly thanked.
p351
aVThe person has to be alive.
p352
aVNow, OK, you can open your eyes.
p353
aVI hope all of you have such a person.
p354
aVYour assignment, when you're learning the gratitude visit,
p355
aVis to write a 300-word testimonial to that person,
p356
aVcall them on the phone in Phoenix,
p357
aVask if you can visit, don't tell them why.
p358
aVShow up at their door,
p359
aVyou read the testimonial \u2014 everyone weeps when this happens.
p360
aVAnd what happens is, when we test people
p361
aVone week later, a month later, three months later,
p362
aVthey're both happier and less depressed.
p363
aa(lp364
VAnother example is a strengths date,
p365
aVin which we get couples to identify their highest strengths
p366
aVon the strengths test,
p367
aVand then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths.
p368
aVWe find this is a strengthener of relationships.
p369
aVAnd fun versus philanthropy.
p370
aVIt's so heartening to be in a group like this,
p371
aVin which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy.
p372
aVWell, my undergraduates and the people I work with haven't discovered this,
p373
aVso we actually have people do something altruistic
p374
aVand do something fun,
p375
aVand contrast it.
p376
aVAnd what you find is when you do something fun,
p377
aVit has a square wave walk set.
p378
aVWhen you do something philanthropic to help another person,
p379
aVit lasts and it lasts.
p380
aVSo those are examples of positive interventions.
p381
aa(lp382
VSo the next to last thing I want to say is:
p383
aVwe're interested in how much life satisfaction people have.
p384
aVThis is really what you're about.
p385
aVAnd that's our target variable.
p386
aVAnd we ask the question as a function of the three different lives,
p387
aVhow much life satisfaction do you get?
p388
aVSo we ask \u2014 and we've done this in 15 replications,
p389
aVinvolving thousands of people:
p390
aVTo what extent does the pursuit of pleasure,
p391
aVthe pursuit of positive emotion,
p392
aVthe pleasant life,
p393
aVthe pursuit of engagement, time stopping for you,
p394
aVand the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction?
p395
aa(lp396
VAnd our results surprised us; they were backward of what we thought.
p397
aVIt turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution
p398
aVto life satisfaction.
p399
aVThe pursuit of meaning is the strongest.
p400
aVThe pursuit of engagement is also very strong.
p401
aVWhere pleasure matters is if you have both engagement
p402
aVand you have meaning,
p403
aVthen pleasure's the whipped cream and the cherry.
p404
aVWhich is to say, the full life \u2014 the sum is greater than the parts,
p405
aVif you've got all three.
p406
aVConversely, if you have none of the three, the empty life,
p407
aVthe sum is less than the parts.
p408
aa(lp409
VAnd what we're asking now is: Does the very same relationship \u2014
p410
aVphysical health, morbidity, how long you live and productivity \u2014
p411
aVfollow the same relationship?
p412
aVThat is, in a corporation,
p413
aVis productivity a function of positive emotion, engagement and meaning?
p414
aVIs health a function of positive engagement,
p415
aVof pleasure, and of meaning in life?
p416
aVAnd there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes.
p417
aa(lp418
VSo, Chris said that the last speaker had a chance
p419
aVto try to integrate what he heard,
p420
aVand so this was amazing for me.
p421
aVI've never been in a gathering like this.
p422
aVI've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much,
p423
aVwhich was one of the remarkable things.
p424
aVBut I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel
p425
aVto the problems of technology, entertainment and design
p426
aVin the following way:
p427
aVwe all know that technology, entertainment and design
p428
aVhave been and can be used for destructive purposes.
p429
aVWe also know that technology, entertainment and design
p430
aVcan be used to relieve misery.
p431
aVAnd by the way, the distinction between relieving misery
p432
aVand building happiness is extremely important.
p433
aVI thought, when I first became a therapist 30 years ago,
p434
aVthat if I was good enough to make someone not depressed,
p435
aVnot anxious, not angry,
p436
aVthat I'd make them happy.
p437
aVAnd I never found that;
p438
aVI found the best you could ever do
p439
aVwas to get to zero;
p440
aVthat they were empty.
p441
aa(lp442
VAnd it turns out the skills of happiness, the skills of the pleasant life,
p443
aVthe skills of engagement, the skills of meaning,
p444
aVare different from the skills of relieving misery.
p445
aVAnd so, the parallel thing holds with technology, entertainment
p446
aVand design, I believe.
p447
aVThat is, it is possible for these three drivers of our world
p448
aVto increase happiness,
p449
aVto increase positive emotion.
p450
aVAnd that's typically how they've been used.
p451
aVBut once you fractionate happiness the way I do \u2014
p452
aVnot just positive emotion, that's not nearly enough \u2014
p453
aVthere's flow in life, and there's meaning in life.
p454
aVAs Laura Lee told us,
p455
aVdesign and, I believe, entertainment and technology,
p456
aVcan be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well.

VSo in conclusion,
p459
aVthe eleventh reason for optimism,
p460
aVin addition to the space elevator,
p461
aVis that I think with technology, entertainment and design,
p462
aVwe can actually increase the amount of tonnage
p463
aVof human happiness on the planet.
p464
aVAnd if technology can, in the next decade or two,
p465
aVincrease the pleasant life, the good life and the meaningful life,
p466
aVit will be good enough.
p467
aVIf entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion,
p468
aVmeaning eudaemonia,
p469
aVit will be good enough.
p470
aVAnd if design can increase positive emotion,
p471
aVeudaemonia, and flow and meaning,
p472
aVwhat we're all doing together will become good enough.
