VAbout 12 years ago,
p4
aVI gave up my career in banking
p5
aVto try to make the world a safer place.
p6
aVThis involved a journey into national and global advocacy
p7
aVand meeting some of the most extraordinary people in the world.
p8
aVIn the process, I became a civil society diplomat.
p9
aa(lp10
VCivil society diplomats do three things:
p11
aVThey voice the concerns of the people,
p12
aVare not pinned down by national interests,
p13
aVand influence change through citizen networks,
p14
aVnot only state ones.
p15
aVAnd if you want to change the world, we need more of them.
p16
aa(lp17
VBut many people still ask,
p18
aV"Can civil society really make a big difference?
p19
aVCan citizens influence and shape national and global policy?"
p20
aVI never thought I would ask myself these questions,
p21
aVbut here I am to share some lessons
p22
aVabout two powerful civil society  movements that I've been involved in.
p23
aVThey are in issues that I'm passionate about:
p24
aVgun control and drug policy.
p25
aVAnd these are issues that matter here.
p26
aVLatin America is ground zero for both of them.
p27
aa(lp28
VFor example, Brazil \u2014
p29
aVthis beautiful country hosting TEDGlobal has the world's ugliest record.
p30
aVWe are the number one champion in homicidal violence.
p31
aVOne in every 10 people killed around the world is a Brazilian.
p32
aVThis translates into over 56,000 people
p33
aVdying violently each year.
p34
aVMost of them are young, black boys dying by guns.
p35
aVBrazil is also one of the world's largest consumers of drugs,
p36
aVand the War on Drugs has been especially painful here.
p37
aVAround 50 percent of the homicides in the streets in Brazil
p38
aVare related to the War on Drugs.
p39
aVThe same is true for about 25 percent of people in jail.
p40
aVAnd it's not just Brazil that is affected by the twin problems of guns and drugs.
p41
aVVirtually every country and city across Central and South America is in trouble.
p42
aVLatin America has nine percent of the world's population,
p43
aVbut 25 percent of its global violent deaths.
p44
aa(lp45
VThese are not problems we can run away from.
p46
aVI certainly could not.
p47
aVSo the first campaign I got involved with started here in 2003
p48
aVto change Brazil's gun law
p49
aVand to create a program to buy back weapons.
p50
aVIn just a few years,
p51
aVwe not only changed national legislation
p52
aVthat made it much more difficult for civilians to buy a gun,
p53
aVbut we collected and destroyed almost half a million weapons.
p54
aVThis was one of the biggest buyback programs in history \u2014
p55
aV(Applause) \u2014
p56
aVbut we also suffered some setbacks.
p57
aVWe lost a referendum to ban gun sales to civilians in 2005.
p58
aa(lp59
VThe second initiative was also home-grown,
p60
aVbut is today a global movement to reform the international drug control regime.
p61
aVI am the executive coordinator
p62
aVof something called the Global Commission on Drug Policy.
p63
aVThe commission is a high-level group
p64
aVof global leaders brought together to identify more humane
p65
aVand effective approaches to the issue of drugs.
p66
aVSince we started in 2008, the taboo on drugs is broken.
p67
aVAcross the Americas, from the US and Mexico to Colombia and Uruguay,
p68
aVchange is in the air.
p69
aa(lp70
VBut rather than tell you the whole story about these two movements,
p71
aVI just want to share with you four key insights.
p72
aVI call them lessons to change the world.
p73
aVThere are certainly many more,
p74
aVbut these are the ones that stand out to me.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo the first lesson is:
p77
aVChange and control the narrative.
p78
aVIt may seem obvious,
p79
aVbut a key ingredient to civil society diplomacy
p80
aVis first changing and then controlling the narrative.
p81
aVThis is something that veteran politicians understand,
p82
aVbut that civil society groups generally do not do very well.
p83
aVIn the case of drug policy,
p84
aVour biggest success has been to change the discussion
p85
aVaway from prosecuting a War on Drugs
p86
aVto putting people's health and safety first.
p87
aVIn a cutting-edge report we just launched in New York,
p88
aVwe also showed that the groups benefiting most from this $320 billion market
p89
aVare criminal gangs and cartels.
p90
aVSo in order to undermine the power and profit of these groups,
p91
aVwe need to change the conversation.
p92
aVWe need to make illegal drugs legal.
p93
aVBut before I get you too excited,
p94
aVI don't mean drugs should be a free-for-all.
p95
aVWhat I'm talking about, and what the Global Commission advocates for
p96
aVis creating a highly regulated market,
p97
aVwhere different drugs would have different degrees of regulation.
p98
aa(lp99
VAs for gun control, we were successful in changing,
p100
aVbut not so much in controlling, the narrative.
p101
aVAnd this brings me to my next lesson:
p102
aVNever underestimate your opponents.
p103
aVIf you want to succeed in changing the world,
p104
aVyou need to know who you're up against.
p105
aVYou need to learn their motivations and points of view.
p106
aVIn the case of gun control,
p107
aVwe really underestimated our opponents.
p108
aVAfter a very successful gun-collection program,
p109
aVwe were elated.
p110
aVWe had support from 80 percent of Brazilians,
p111
aVand thought that this could help us win the referendum
p112
aVto ban gun sales to civilians.
p113
aVBut we were dead wrong.
p114
aVDuring a televised 20-day public debate,
p115
aVour opponent used our own arguments against us.
p116
aVWe ended up losing the popular vote.
p117
aVIt was really terrible.
p118
aVThe National Rifle Association \u2014 yes, the American NRA \u2014
p119
aVcame to Brazil.
p120
aVThey inundated our campaign with their propaganda,
p121
aVthat as you know,
p122
aVlinks the right to own guns to ideas of freedom and democracy.
p123
aVThey simply threw everything at us.
p124
aVThey used our national flag,
p125
aVour independence anthem.
p126
aVThey invoked women's rights
p127
aVand misused images of Mandela, Tiananmen Square, and even Hitler.
p128
aVThey won by playing with people's fears.
p129
aVIn fact, guns were almost completely ignored in their campaign.
p130
aVTheir focus was on individual rights.
p131
aVBut I ask you,
p132
aVwhich right is more important,
p133
aVthe right to life
p134
aVor the right to have a gun that takes life away?
p135
aV(Applause)
p136
aa(lp137
VWe thought people would vote in defense of life,
p138
aVbut in a country with a recent past of military dictatorship,
p139
aVthe anti-government message of our opponents resonated,
p140
aVand we were not prepared to respond.
p141
aa(lp142
VLesson learned.
p143
aVWe've been more successful in the case of drug policy.
p144
aVIf you asked most people 10 years ago if an end to the War on Drugs was possible,
p145
aVthey would have laughed.
p146
aVAfter all, there are huge military police prisons
p147
aVand financial establishments benefiting from this war.
p148
aVBut today, the international drug control regime is starting to crumble.
p149
aVGovernments and civil societies are experimenting with new approaches.
p150
aVThe Global Commission on Drug Policy
p151
aVreally knew its opposition,
p152
aVand rather than fighting them,
p153
aVour chair \u2014 former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso \u2014
p154
aVreached out to leaders from across the political spectrum,
p155
aVfrom liberals to conservatives.
p156
aVThis high level group agreed to honestly discuss
p157
aVthe merits and flaws of drug policies.
p158
aVIt was this reasoned, informed and strategic discussion
p159
aVthat revealed the sad truth about the War on Drugs.
p160
aVThe War on Drugs has simply failed across every metric.
p161
aVDrugs are cheaper and more available than ever,
p162
aVand consumption has risen globally.
p163
aVBut even worse,
p164
aVit also generated massive negative unintended consequences.
p165
aVIt is true that some people have made these arguments before,
p166
aVbut we've made a difference
p167
aVby anticipating the arguments of our opponents
p168
aVand by leveraging powerful voices
p169
aVthat a few years ago would probably have resisted change.
p170
aa(lp171
VThird lesson: Use data to drive your argument.
p172
aVGuns and drugs are emotive issues,
p173
aVand as we've painfully learned in the gun referendum campaign in Brazil,
p174
aVsometimes it's impossible to cut through the emotions
p175
aVand get to the facts.
p176
aVBut this doesn't mean that we shouldn't try.
p177
aVUntil quite recently,
p178
aVwe simply didn't know how many Brazilians were killed by guns.
p179
aVAmazingly, it was a local soap opera called "Mulheres Apaixonadas" \u2014
p180
aVor "Women in Love" \u2014
p181
aVthat kicked off Brazil's national gun control campaign.
p182
aVIn one highly viewed episode,
p183
aVa soap opera lead actress was killed by a stray bullet.
p184
aVBrazilian grannies and housewives were outraged,
p185
aVand in a case of art imitating life,
p186
aVthis episode also included footage of a real gun control march
p187
aVthat we had organized right here,
p188
aVoutside in Copacabana Beach.
p189
aVThe televised death and march had a huge impact on public opinion.
p190
aVWithin weeks, our national congress approved the disarmament bill
p191
aVthat had been languishing for years.
p192
aVWe were then able to mobilize data
p193
aVto show the successful outcomes of the change in the law
p194
aVand gun collection program.
p195
aVHere is what I mean:
p196
aVWe could prove that in just one year,
p197
aVwe saved more than 5,000 lives.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Applause)
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd in the case of drugs,
p202
aVin order to undermine this fear and prejudice that surrounds the issue,
p203
aVwe managed to gather and present data that shows that today's drug policies
p204
aVcause much more harm than drug use per se,
p205
aVand people are starting to get it.
p206
aa(lp207
VMy fourth insight is:
p208
aVDon't be afraid to bring together odd bedfellows.
p209
aVWhat we've learned in Brazil \u2014
p210
aVand this doesn't only apply to my country \u2014
p211
aVis the importance of bringing diverse and eclectic folks together.
p212
aVIf you want to change the world,
p213
aVit helps to have a good cross-section of society on your side.
p214
aVIn both the case of guns and drugs,
p215
aVwe brought together a wonderful mix of people.
p216
aVWe mobilized the elite and got huge support from the media.
p217
aVWe gathered the victims, human rights champions, cultural icons.
p218
aVWe also assembled the professional classes \u2014
p219
aVdoctors, lawyers, academia and more.
p220
aa(lp221
VWhat I've learned over the last years
p222
aVis that you need coalitions of the willing and of the unwilling to make change.
p223
aVIn the case of drugs,
p224
aVwe needed libertarians, anti-prohibitionists, legalizers,
p225
aVand liberal politicians.
p226
aVThey may not agree on everything;
p227
aVin fact, they disagree on almost everything.
p228
aVBut the legitimacy of the campaign is based on their diverse points of view.
p229
aa(lp230
VOver a decade ago,
p231
aVI had a comfortable future working for an investment bank.
p232
aVI was as far removed from the world of civil society diplomacy
p233
aVas you can imagine.
p234
aVBut I took a chance.
p235
aVI changed course,
p236
aVand on the way, I helped  to create social movements
p237
aVthat I believe have made  some parts of the world safer.
p238
aVEach and every one of us has the power to change the world.
p239
aVNo matter what the issue, and no matter how hard the fight,
p240
aVcivil society is central to the blueprint for change.
p241
aa(lp242
VThank you.
