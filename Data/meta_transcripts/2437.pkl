VI'm a textile artist
p4
aVmost widely known for starting the yarn bombing movement.
p5
aVYarn bombing is when you take knitted or crocheted material
p6
aVout into the urban environment, graffiti-style \u2014
p7
aVor, more specifically,
p8
aVwithout permission and unsanctioned.
p9
aa(lp10
VBut when I started this over 10 years ago,
p11
aVI didn't have a word for it,
p12
aVI didn't have any ambitious notions about it,
p13
aVI had no visions of grandeur.
p14
aVAll I wanted to see was something warm and fuzzy and human-like
p15
aVon the cold, steel, gray facade that I looked at everyday.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo I wrapped the door handle.
p18
aVI call this the Alpha Piece.
p19
aVLittle did I know that this tiny piece would change the course of my life.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo clearly the reaction was interesting.
p22
aVIt intrigued me and I thought, "What else could I do?"
p23
aVCould I do something in the public domain that would get the same reaction?
p24
aVSo I wrapped the stop sign pole near my house.
p25
aVThe reaction was wild.
p26
aVPeople would park their cars
p27
aVand get out of their cars and stare at it,
p28
aVand scratch their heads and stare at it,
p29
aVand take pictures of it and take pictures next to it,
p30
aVand all of that was really exciting to me
p31
aVand I wanted to do every stop sign pole in the neighborhood.
p32
aVAnd the more that I did, the stronger the reaction.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo at this point I'm smitten.
p35
aVI'm hooked.
p36
aVThis was all seductive.
p37
aVI found my new passion
p38
aVand the urban environment was my playground.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo this is some of my early work.
p41
aVI was very curious about this idea of enhancing the ordinary,
p42
aVthe mundane, even the ugly,
p43
aVand not taking away its identity or its functionality
p44
aVbut just giving it a well-tailored suit out of knitting.
p45
aVAnd this was fun for me.
p46
aVIt was really fun to take inanimate objects
p47
aVand have them come to life.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo ...
p50
aVI think we all see the humor in this,
p51
aVbut \u2014
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VI was at a point where I wanted to take it seriously.
p56
aVI wanted to analyze it.
p57
aVI wanted to know why I was letting this take over my life,
p58
aVwhy I was passionate about it,
p59
aVwhy were other people reacting so strongly to it.
p60
aVAnd I realized something.
p61
aVWe all live in this fast-paced, digital world,
p62
aVbut we still crave and desire something that's relatable.
p63
aa(lp64
VI think we've all become desensitized
p65
aVby our overdeveloped cities that we live in,
p66
aVand billboards and advertisements,
p67
aVand giant parking lots,
p68
aVand we don't even complain about that stuff anymore.
p69
aVSo when you stumble upon
p70
aVa stop sign pole that's wrapped in knitting
p71
aVand it seems so out of place
p72
aVand then gradually \u2014 weirdly \u2014
p73
aVyou find a connection to it,
p74
aVthat is the moment.
p75
aVThat is the moment I love
p76
aVand that is the moment I love to share with others.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo at this point, my curiosity grew.
p79
aVIt went from the fire hydrants and the stop sign poles
p80
aVto what else can I do with this material.
p81
aVCan I do something big and large-scale and insurmountable?
p82
aa(lp83
VSo that's when the bus happened.
p84
aVThis was a real game changer for me.
p85
aVI'll always have a soft spot in my heart for this one.
p86
aa(lp87
VAt this point, people were recognizing my work
p88
aVbut there wasn't much out there
p89
aVthat was wrapped in knitting that was large-scale,
p90
aVand this definitely was the first city bus to be wrapped in knitting.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo at this point, I'm experiencing,
p93
aVor I'm witnessing something interesting.
p94
aVI may have started yarn bombing but I certainly don't own it anymore.
p95
aVIt had reached global status.
p96
aVPeople from all over the world were doing this.
p97
aVAnd I know this because I would travel to certain parts of the world
p98
aVthat I'd never been to,
p99
aVand I'd stumble upon a stop sign pole and I knew I didn't wrap it.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo as I pursued my own goals with my art \u2014
p102
aVthis is a lot of my recent work \u2014
p103
aVso was yarn bombing.
p104
aVYarn bombing was also growing.
p105
aVAnd that experience showed me the hidden power of this craft
p106
aVand showed me
p107
aVthat there was this common language I had with the rest of the world.
p108
aVIt was through this granny hobby \u2014
p109
aVthis unassuming hobby \u2014
p110
aVthat I found commonality with people
p111
aVthat I never thought I'd have a connection with.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo as I tell my story today,
p114
aVI'd also like to convey to you
p115
aVthat hidden power can be found in the most unassuming places,
p116
aVand we all possess skills that are just waiting to be discovered.
p117
aa(lp118
VIf you think about our hands, these tools that are connected to us,
p119
aVand what they're capable of doing \u2014
p120
aVbuilding houses and furniture,
p121
aVand painting giant murals \u2014
p122
aVand most of the time we hold a controller or a cell phone.
p123
aVAnd I'm totally guilty of this as well.
p124
aVBut if you think about it,
p125
aVwhat would happen if you put those things down?
p126
aVWhat would you make? What would you create with your own hands?
p127
aa(lp128
VA lot of people think that I am a master knitter
p129
aVbut I actually couldn't knit a sweater to save my life.
p130
aVBut I did something interesting with knitting
p131
aVthat had never been done before.
p132
aa(lp133
VI also wasn't "supposed to be" an artist
p134
aVin the sense that I wasn't formally trained to do this \u2014
p135
aVI'm a math major actually.
p136
aVSo I didn't think this was in the cards for me,
p137
aVbut I also know that I didn't stumble upon this.
p138
aVAnd when this happened to me, I held on tight,
p139
aVI fought for it and I'm proud to say that I am a working artist today.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo as we ponder the future,
p142
aVknow that your future might not be so seamless.
p143
aVAnd one day, you might be as bored as I was
p144
aVand knit a door handle to change your world forever.
p145
aa(lp146
VThank you.
