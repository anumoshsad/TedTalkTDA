VAnyone in the room thought about sex today?
p4
aV(Laughter)
p5
aVYeah, you did.
p6
aVThank you for putting your hand up over there.
p7
aVWell, I'm here to provide you with
p8
aVsome biological validation
p9
aVfor your sordid daydreams.
p10
aVI'm here to tell you a few things
p11
aVthat you might not have known about wild sex.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow, when humans think about sex,
p14
aVmale and female forms
p15
aVare generally what come to mind,
p16
aVbut for many millions of years,
p17
aVsuch specific categories didn't even exist.
p18
aVSex was a mere fusion of bodies
p19
aVor a trickle of DNA
p20
aVshared between two or more beings.
p21
aVIt wasn't until about 500 million years ago
p22
aVthat we start to see structures akin to a penis
p23
aVor a thing that gives DNA out,
p24
aVand a vagina, something that receives it.
p25
aVNow invariably, you're probably thinking about
p26
aVwhat belongs to our own species,
p27
aVthese very familiar structures,
p28
aVbut the diversity that we see in sexual structures
p29
aVin the animal kingdom that has evolved
p30
aVin response to the multitude of factors
p31
aVsurrounding reproduction
p32
aVis pretty mind-blowing.
p33
aa(lp34
VPenile diversity is especially profuse.
p35
aVSo this is a paper nautilus.
p36
aVIt's a close relative of squid and octopus,
p37
aVand males have a hectocotylus.
p38
aVJust what is a hectocotylus?
p39
aVA detachable, swimming penis.
p40
aVIt leaves the [body of the male],
p41
aVfinds the female through pheromonal cues in the water,
p42
aVattaches itself to her body
p43
aVand deposits the sperm.
p44
aVFor many decades, biologists actually felt
p45
aVthat the hectocotylus was a separate organism altogether.
p46
aVNow, the tapir is a mammal from South America.
p47
aVAnd the tapir has a prehensile penis.
p48
aVIt actually has a level of dexterity in its penis
p49
aVmuch akin to what we have with our hands.
p50
aVAnd it uses this dexterity
p51
aVto bypass the vagina altogether
p52
aVand deposit sperm directly into the female's uterus,
p53
aVnot to mention it's a pretty good size.
p54
aVThe biggest penis in the animal kingdom,
p55
aVhowever, is not that of the tapir.
p56
aVThe biggest penis-to-body-size ratio
p57
aVin the animal kingdom actually belongs
p58
aVto the meager beach barnacle,
p59
aVand this video is actually showing you
p60
aVwhat the human penis would look like
p61
aVif it were the same size as that of a barnacle.
p62
aV(Laughter)
p63
aVMm-hm. (Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VSo with all of this diversity in structure,
p66
aVone might think, then, that penises
p67
aVare fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place
p68
aVfor the purposes of successful reproduction.
p69
aVSimply insert part A into slot B,
p70
aVand we should all be good to go.
p71
aVBut of course, that doesn't exactly happen,
p72
aVand that's because we can't just take form into account.
p73
aVWe have to think about function as well,
p74
aVand when it comes to sex,
p75
aVfunction relates to the contributions made
p76
aVby the gametes, or the sperm and the eggs.
p77
aVAnd these contributions are far from equal.
p78
aVEggs are very expensive to make,
p79
aVso it makes sense for females to be very choosy
p80
aVabout who she shares them with.
p81
aVSperm, on the other hand, is abundant and cheap,
p82
aVso it makes more sense for males
p83
aVto have a more-sex-is-better strategy
p84
aVwhen it comes to siring members
p85
aVof future generations.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo how do animals cope
p88
aVwith these very incongruent needs between the sexes?
p89
aVI mean, if a female doesn't choose a particular male,
p90
aVor if she has the ability to store sperm
p91
aVand she simply has enough,
p92
aVthen it makes more sense for her to spend her time
p93
aVdoing other biologically relevant things:
p94
aVavoiding predators, taking care of offspring,
p95
aVgathering and ingesting food.
p96
aVThis is, of course, bad news for any male
p97
aVwho has yet to make a deposit in her sperm bank,
p98
aVand this sets the scene for some pretty drastic strategies
p99
aVfor successful fertilization.
p100
aVThis is bedbug sex,
p101
aVand it's aptly termed traumatic insemination.
p102
aVMales have a spiked, barbed penis
p103
aVthat they literally stab into the female,
p104
aVand they don't stab it anywhere near her vagina.
p105
aVThey stab it anywhere in her body,
p106
aVand the sperm simply migrates
p107
aVthrough her hemolymph to her ovaries.
p108
aVIf a female gets too many stab wounds,
p109
aVor if a stab wound happens to become infected,
p110
aVshe can actually die from it.
p111
aa(lp112
VNow if you've ever been out for a nice,
p113
aVpeaceful walk by the lake
p114
aVand happened to see some ducks having sex,
p115
aVyou've undoubtedly been alarmed,
p116
aVbecause it looks like gang rape.
p117
aVAnd quite frankly, that's exactly what it is.
p118
aVA group of males will grab a female,
p119
aVhold her down,
p120
aVand ballistically ejaculate their spiral-shaped penis
p121
aVinto her corkscrew-shaped vagina
p122
aVover and over and over again.
p123
aVFrom flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second.
p124
aVNow the female actually gets the last laugh, though,
p125
aVbecause she can actually manipulate her posture
p126
aVso as to allow the sperm of certain suitors
p127
aVbetter access to her ovaries.
p128
aa(lp129
VNow, I like to share stories like this with my audiences
p130
aVbecause, yeah, we humans,
p131
aVwe tend to think sex, sex is fun, sex is good,
p132
aVthere's romance, and there's orgasm.
p133
aVBut orgasm didn't actually evolve
p134
aVuntil about 65 million years ago
p135
aVwith the advent of mammals.
p136
aVBut some animals had it going on quite a bit before that.
p137
aVThere are some more primitive ways
p138
aVof pleasing one's partner.
p139
aa(lp140
VEarwig males have either
p141
aVreally large penile appendages
p142
aVor really small ones.
p143
aVIt's a very simple genetically inherited trait
p144
aVand the males are not otherwise any different.
p145
aVThose that have long penile appendages
p146
aVare not bigger or stronger
p147
aVor otherwise any different at all.
p148
aVSo going back to our biological minds, then,
p149
aVwe might think that females should choose
p150
aVto have sex with the guys that have the shorter appendages,
p151
aVbecause she can use her time for other things:
p152
aVavoiding predators, taking care of young,
p153
aVfinding and ingesting food.
p154
aVBut biologists have repeatedly observed
p155
aVthat females choose to have sex
p156
aVwith the males that have the long appendages.
p157
aVWhy do they do this?
p158
aVWell, according to the biological literature,
p159
aV"During copulation, the genitalia of certain males
p160
aVmay elicit more favorable female responses
p161
aVthrough superior mechanical or stimulatory interaction
p162
aVwith the female reproductive tract."
p163
aVMm-hm.
p164
aa(lp165
VThese are Mexican guppies,
p166
aVand what you see on their upper maxilla
p167
aVis an outgrowth of epidermal filaments,
p168
aVand these filaments basically form
p169
aVa fish mustache, if you will.
p170
aVNow males have been observed to prod
p171
aVthe female's genital opening
p172
aVprior to copulating with her,
p173
aVand in what I have lovingly termed the Magnum, P.I. hypothesis,
p174
aVfemales are overwhelmingly more likely to be found
p175
aVwith males that have these fish mustaches.
p176
aVA little guppy porn for you right there.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo we've seen very different strategies
p179
aVthat males are using when it comes to
p180
aVwinning a female partner.
p181
aVWe've seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures are used in a forceful way
p182
aVto basically make a female have sex.
p183
aVWe've also seen a titillation strategy
p184
aVwhere males are actually
p185
aVpleasing their female partners into choosing them
p186
aVas a sex partner.
p187
aVNow unfortunately, in the animal kingdom,
p188
aVit's the coercion strategy that we see
p189
aVtime and time again.
p190
aVIt's very common in many phyla,
p191
aVfrom invertebrates to avian species,
p192
aVmammals, and, of course, even in primates.
p193
aa(lp194
VNow interestingly, there  are a few mammalian species
p195
aVin which females have evolved specialized genitalia
p196
aVthat doesn't allow for sexual coercion to take place.
p197
aVFemale elephants and female hyenas
p198
aVhave a penile clitoris,
p199
aVor an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally,
p200
aVmuch like a penis,
p201
aVand in fact it's very difficult to sex these animals
p202
aVby merely looking at their external morphology.
p203
aVSo before a male can insert his penis into a female's vagina,
p204
aVshe has to take this penile clitoris
p205
aVand basically inside-out it in her own body.
p206
aVI mean, imagine putting a penis into another penis.
p207
aVIt's simply not going to happen
p208
aVunless the female is on board with the action.
p209
aVNow, even more interesting is the fact
p210
aVthat elephant and hyena societies
p211
aVare entirely matriarchal:
p212
aVthey're run by females, groups of females,
p213
aVsisters, aunts and offspring,
p214
aVand when young males attain sexual maturity,
p215
aVthey're turfed out of the group.
p216
aVIn hyena societies, adult males
p217
aVare actually the lowest on the social scale.
p218
aVThey can take part in a kill only after
p219
aVeverybody else, including the offspring.
p220
aVSo it seems that when you take the penis power
p221
aVaway from a male,
p222
aVyou take away all the social power he has.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo what are my take-home messages from my talk today?
p225
aVWell, sex is just so much more
p226
aVthan insert part A into slot B
p227
aVand hope that the offspring run around everywhere.
p228
aVThe sexual strategies and reproductive structures
p229
aVthat we see in the animal kingdom basically
p230
aVdictate how males and females will react to each other,
p231
aVwhich then dictates how populations and societies
p232
aVform and evolve.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo it may not be surprising to any of you
p235
aVthat animals, including ourselves,
p236
aVspend a good amount of time thinking about sex,
p237
aVbut what might surprise you is the extent to which
p238
aVso many other aspects of their lives and our lives
p239
aVare influenced by it.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo thank you, and happy daydreaming.
