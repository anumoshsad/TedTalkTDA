VSo let me start by taking you back,
p4
aVback into the mists of your memory
p5
aVto perhaps the most anticipated year in your life,
p6
aVbut certainly the most anticipated year
p7
aVin all human history:
p8
aVthe year 2000. Remember that?
p9
aVY2K, the dotcom bubble,
p10
aVstressing about whose party you're going to go to
p11
aVas the clock strikes midnight,
p12
aVbefore the champagne goes flat,
p13
aVand then there's that inchoate yearning
p14
aVthat was felt, I think, by many, that the millennium,
p15
aVthat the year 2000, should mean more,
p16
aVmore than just a two and some zeroes.
p17
aa(lp18
VWell, amazingly, for once, our world leaders
p19
aVactually lived up to that millennium moment
p20
aVand back in 2000 agreed to some
p21
aVpretty extraordinary stuff:
p22
aVvisionary, measurable, long-term targets
p23
aVcalled the Millennium Development Goals.
p24
aa(lp25
VNow, I'm sure you all keep a copy of the goals
p26
aVunder your pillow, or by the bedside table,
p27
aVbut just in case you don't,
p28
aVand your memory needs some jogging,
p29
aVthe deal agreed then goes like this:
p30
aVdeveloping countries promised to at least halve
p31
aVextreme poverty, hunger and deaths from disease,
p32
aValongside some other targets, by 2015,
p33
aVand developed nations promised to help them
p34
aVget that done by dropping debts,
p35
aVincreasing smart aid, and trade reform.
p36
aa(lp37
VWell, we're approaching 2015,
p38
aVso we'd better assess, how are we doing on these goals?
p39
aVBut we've also got to decide, do we like such global goals?
p40
aVSome people don't. And if we like them, we've got to decide
p41
aVwhat we want to do on these goals going forward.
p42
aVWhat does the world want to do together?
p43
aVWe've got to decide a process by which we decide.
p44
aa(lp45
VWell, I definitely think these goals are worth building on
p46
aVand seeing through, and here's just a few reasons why.
p47
aVIncredible partnerships between the private sector,
p48
aVpolitical leaders, philanthropists
p49
aVand amazing grassroots activists
p50
aVacross the developing world,
p51
aVbut also 250,000 people marched in the streets
p52
aVof Edinburgh outside this very building
p53
aVfor Make Poverty History.
p54
aa(lp55
VAll together, they achieved these results:
p56
aVincreased the number of people on anti-retrovirals,
p57
aVlife-saving anti-AIDS drugs;
p58
aVnearly halved deaths from malaria;
p59
aVvaccinated so many that 5.4 million lives will be saved.
p60
aVAnd combined, this is going to result
p61
aVin two million fewer children dying every year,
p62
aVlast year, than in the year 2000.
p63
aVThat's 5,000 fewer kids dying every day,
p64
aVten times you lot not dead every day,
p65
aVbecause of all of these partnerships.
p66
aVSo I think this is amazing living proof of progress
p67
aVthat more people should know about,
p68
aVbut the challenge of communicating this kind of good news
p69
aVis probably the subject of a different TEDTalk.
p70
aVAnyway, for now, anyone involved in getting these results,
p71
aVthank you. I think this proved these goals are worth it.
p72
aa(lp73
VBut there's still a lot of unfinished business.
p74
aVStill, 7.6 million children die every year of preventable,
p75
aVtreatable diseases,
p76
aVand 178 million kids are malnourished
p77
aVto the point of stunting, a horrible term
p78
aVwhich means physical and cognitive lifelong impairment.
p79
aVSo there's plainly a lot more to do on the goals we've got.
p80
aa(lp81
VBut then, a lot of people think there are things
p82
aVthat should have been in the original package
p83
aVthat weren't agreed back then that should now be included,
p84
aVlike sustainable development targets,
p85
aVnatural resource governance targets,
p86
aVaccess to opportunity, to knowledge,
p87
aVequity, fighting corruption.
p88
aVAll of this is measurable and could be in the new goals.
p89
aa(lp90
VBut the key thing here is,
p91
aVwhat do you think should be in the new goals?
p92
aVWhat do you want?
p93
aVAre you annoyed that I didn't talk about gender equality
p94
aVor education?
p95
aVShould those be in the new package of goals?
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd quite frankly, that's a good question,
p98
aVbut there's going to be some tough tradeoffs
p99
aVand choices here, so you want to hope
p100
aVthat the process by which the world decides
p101
aVthese new goals is going to be legitimate, right?
p102
aa(lp103
VWell, as we gather here in Edinburgh,
p104
aVtechnocrats appointed by the U.N. and certain governments,
p105
aVwith the best intentions, are busying themselves
p106
aVdesigning a new package of goals,
p107
aVand currently they're doing that through pretty much the same old
p108
aVlate-20th-century, top-down, elite, closed process.
p109
aa(lp110
VBut, of course, since then, the Web and mobile telephony,
p111
aValong with ubiquitous reality TV formats
p112
aVhave spread all around the world.
p113
aVSo what we'd like to propose is that we use them
p114
aVto involve people from all around the world
p115
aVin an historic first: the world's first truly global
p116
aVpoll and consultation, where everyone everywhere
p117
aVhas an equal voice for the very first time.
p118
aa(lp119
VI mean, wouldn't it be a huge historic missed opportunity
p120
aVnot to do this, given that we can?
p121
aVThere's hundreds of billions of your aid dollars at stake,
p122
aVtens of millions of lives, or deaths, at stake,
p123
aVand, I'd argue, the security and future
p124
aVof you and your family is also at stake.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo, if you're with me, I'd say there's three essential steps
p127
aVin this crowdsourcing campaign:
p128
aVcollecting, connecting and committing.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo first of all, we've got to ground this campaign
p131
aVin core polling data.
p132
aVLet's go into every country that will let us in,
p133
aVask 1,001 people what they want
p134
aVthe new goals to be, making special efforts
p135
aVto reach the poorest, those without access
p136
aVto modern technology, and let's make sure that their views
p137
aVare at the center of the goals going forward.
p138
aa(lp139
VThen, we've got to commission a baseline survey
p140
aVto make sure we can monitor and progress the goals
p141
aVgoing forward. The original goals didn't really have
p142
aVgood baseline survey data,
p143
aVand we're going to need the help of big data through all of this process to make sure
p144
aVwe can really monitor the progress.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd then we've got to connect with the big crowd.
p147
aVNow here, we see the role for an unprecedented coalition
p148
aVof social media giants and upstarts,
p149
aVtelecoms companies, reality TV show formats,
p150
aVgaming companies, telecoms, all of them together
p151
aVin kind of their "We Are The World" moment.
p152
aVCould they come together and help
p153
aVthe Millennium Development Goals get rebranded
p154
aVinto the Millennial Generation's Goals?
p155
aVAnd if just five percent of the five billion plus
p156
aVwho are currently connected made a comment,
p157
aVand that comment turned into a commitment,
p158
aVwe could crowdsource a force of 300 million people
p159
aVaround the world to help see these goals through.
p160
aa(lp161
VIf we have this collected data, and this connected crowd,
p162
aVbased upon our experience of campaigning
p163
aVand getting world leaders to commit,
p164
aVI think world leaders will commit
p165
aVto most of the crowdsourced recommendations.
p166
aa(lp167
VBut the question really is, through this process
p168
aVwill we all have become committed?
p169
aVAnd if we are, are we ready to iterate, monitor
p170
aVand provide feedback, make sure these promises
p171
aVare really delivering results?
p172
aa(lp173
VWell, there's some fantastic examples here to scale up,
p174
aVmostly piloted within Africa, actually.
p175
aVThere's Open Data Kenya, which geocodes
p176
aVand crowdsources information about where projects are,
p177
aVare they delivering results.
p178
aVOften, they're not in the right place.
p179
aVAnd Ushahidi, which means "witness" in Swahili,
p180
aVwhich geocodes and crowdsources information
p181
aVin complex emergencies to help target responses.
p182
aVThis is some of the most exciting stuff
p183
aVin development and democracy,
p184
aVwhere citizens on the edge of a network
p185
aVare helping to force open the process
p186
aVto make sure that the big global aid promises
p187
aVand vague stuff up at the top really delivers for people
p188
aVat a grassroots level and inverts that pyramid.
p189
aVThis openness, this forcing openness, is key,
p190
aVand if it wasn't entirely transparent already,
p191
aVI should be open: I've got a completely transparent agenda.
p192
aa(lp193
VLong-term trends suggest that this century
p194
aVis going to be a tough place to live,
p195
aVwith population increases, consumption patterns increasing,
p196
aVand conflict over scarce natural resources.
p197
aVAnd look at the state of global politics today.
p198
aVLook at the Rio Earth Summit that happened just last week,
p199
aVor the Mexican G20, also last week.
p200
aVBoth, if we're honest, a bust.
p201
aVOur world leaders, our global politics,
p202
aVcurrently can't get it done.
p203
aVThey need our help. They need the cavalry,
p204
aVand the cavalry's not going to come from Mars.
p205
aVIt's got to come from us, and I see this process
p206
aVof deciding democratically in a bottom-up fashion
p207
aVwhat the world wants to work on together
p208
aVas one vital means by which we can crowdsource
p209
aVthe force to really build that constituency
p210
aVthat's going to reinvigorate global governance
p211
aVin the 21st century.
p212
aa(lp213
VI started in 2000. Let me finish in 2030.
p214
aa(lp215
VMany people made fun of a big campaign a few years ago
p216
aVwe had called Make Poverty History.
p217
aVIt was a naive thought in many people's minds,
p218
aVand it's true, it was just a t-shirt slogan
p219
aVthat worked for the moment. But look.
p220
aVThe empirical condition of living under a dollar and 25
p221
aVis trending down, and look where it gets to by 2030.
p222
aVIt's getting near zero.
p223
aVNow sure, progress in China and India
p224
aVand poverty reduction there was key to that,
p225
aVbut recently also in Africa, poverty rates are being reduced.
p226
aVIt will get harder as we get towards zero,
p227
aVas the poor will be increasingly located
p228
aVin post-conflict, fragile states,
p229
aVor maybe in middle income states
p230
aVwhere they don't really care about the marginalized.
p231
aVBut I'm confident, with the right kind of political campaigning
p232
aVand creative and technological innovation combined
p233
aVworking together more and more as one,
p234
aVI think we can get this and other goals done.
p235
aa(lp236
VThank you. (Applause)
p237
aa(lp238
V(Applause)
p239
aa(lp240
VChris Anderson: Jamie, here's the puzzle to me.
p241
aVIf there was an incident today where a hundred kids
p242
aVdied in some tragedy or where, say, a hundred kids
p243
aVwere kidnapped and then rescued by special forces,
p244
aVI mean, it would be all over the news for a week, right?
p245
aVYou just put up, just as one of your numbers there,
p246
aVthat 5,000 \u2014 is that the number?
p247
aa(lp248
VJamie Drummond: Fewer children every day.
p249
aa(lp250
VCA: Five thousand fewer children dying every day.
p251
aVI mean, it dwarfs, dwarfs everything
p252
aVthat is actually on our news agenda, and it's invisible.
p253
aVThis must drive you crazy.
p254
aa(lp255
VJD: It does, and we're having a huge debate in this country
p256
aVabout aid levels, for example, and aid alone is not
p257
aVthe whole solution. Nobody thinks it is.
p258
aVBut, you know, if people saw the results of this smart aid,
p259
aVI mean, they'd be going crazy for it.
p260
aVI wish the 250,000 people who really did march
p261
aVoutside this very building knew these results.
p262
aVRight now they don't, and it would be great to find a way
p263
aVto better communicate it, because we have not.
p264
aVCreatively, we've failed to communicate this success so far.
p265
aVIf those kinds of efforts just could multiply their voice
p266
aVand amplify it at the key moments, I know for a fact
p267
aVwe'd get better policy.
p268
aVThe Mexican G20 need not have been a bust.
p269
aVRio, if anyone cares about the environment,
p270
aVneed not have been a bust, okay?
p271
aVBut these conferences are going on,
p272
aVand I know people get skeptical and cynical
p273
aVabout the big global summits and the promises
p274
aVand their never being kept, but actually,
p275
aVthe bits that are, are making a difference,
p276
aVand what the politicians need
p277
aVis more permission from the public.
p278
aa(lp279
VCA: But you haven't fully worked out the Web mechanisms, etc.
p280
aVby which this might happen.
p281
aVI mean, if the people here who've had experience
p282
aVusing open platforms, you're interested to talk with them
p283
aVthis week and try to take this forward.
p284
aa(lp285
VJD: Absolutely. CA: All right, well I must say,
p286
aVif this conference led in some way
p287
aVto advancing that idea, that's a huge idea,
p288
aVand if you carry that forward, that is really awesome,
p289
aVso thank you. JD: I'd love your help.
p290
aa(lp291
VCA: Thank you, thank you.
