VWhat is love?
p4
aVIt's a hard term to define
p5
aVin so far as it has a very wide application.
p6
aVI can love jogging.
p7
aVI can love a book, a movie.
p8
aVI can love escalopes.
p9
aVI can love my wife.
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VBut there's a great difference
p13
aVbetween an escalope and my wife, for instance.
p14
aVThat is, if I value the escalope,
p15
aVthe escalope, on the other hand,  it doesn't value me back.
p16
aVWhereas my wife, she calls me
p17
aVthe star of her life.
p18
aV(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VTherefore, only another desiring conscience
p21
aVcan conceive me as a desirable being.
p22
aVI know this, that's why
p23
aVlove can be defined in a more accurate way
p24
aVas the desire of being desired.
p25
aVHence the eternal problem of love:
p26
aVhow to become and remain desirable?
p27
aa(lp28
VThe individual used to find
p29
aVan answer to this problem
p30
aVby submitting his life to community rules.
p31
aVYou had a specific part to play
p32
aVaccording to your sex, your age,
p33
aVyour social status,
p34
aVand you only had to play your part
p35
aVto be valued and loved by the whole community.
p36
aVThink about the young woman who must remain chaste before marriage.
p37
aVThink about the youngest son  who must obey the eldest son,
p38
aVwho in turn must obey the patriarch.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut a phenomenon
p41
aVstarted in the 13th century,
p42
aVmainly in the Renaissance, in the West,
p43
aVthat caused the biggest identity crisis
p44
aVin the history of humankind.
p45
aVThis phenomenon is modernity.
p46
aVWe can basically summarize it through a triple process.
p47
aVFirst, a process of rationalization of scientific research,
p48
aVwhich has accelerated technical progress.
p49
aVNext, a process of political democratization,
p50
aVwhich has fostered individual rights.
p51
aVAnd finally, a process of rationalization  of economic production
p52
aVand of trade liberalization.
p53
aa(lp54
VThese three intertwined processes
p55
aVhave completely annihilated
p56
aVall the traditional bearings of Western societies,
p57
aVwith radical consequences for the individual.
p58
aVNow individuals are free
p59
aVto value or disvalue
p60
aVany attitude, any choice, any object.
p61
aVBut as a result, they are themselves confronted
p62
aVwith this same freedom that others have
p63
aVto value or disvalue them.
p64
aVIn other words, my value was once ensured
p65
aVby submitting myself  to the traditional authorities.
p66
aVNow it is quoted in the stock exchange.
p67
aa(lp68
VOn the free market of individual desires,
p69
aVI negotiate my value every day.
p70
aVHence the anxiety of contemporary man.
p71
aVHe is obsessed: "Am I desirable? How desirable?
p72
aVHow many people are going to love me?"
p73
aVAnd how does he respond to this anxiety?
p74
aVWell, by hysterically collecting symbols of desirability.
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VI call this act of collecting,
p78
aValong with others, seduction capital.
p79
aVIndeed, our consumer society
p80
aVis largely based on seduction capital.
p81
aVIt is said about this consumption that our age is materialistic.
p82
aVBut it's not true! We only accumulate objects
p83
aVin order to communicate with other minds.
p84
aVWe do it to make them love us, to seduce them.
p85
aVNothing could be less materialistic,  or more sentimental,
p86
aVthan a teenager buying brand new jeans
p87
aVand tearing them at the knees,
p88
aVbecause he wants to please Jennifer.
p89
aV(Laughter)
p90
aVConsumerism is not materialism.
p91
aVIt is rather what is swallowed up
p92
aVand sacrificed in the name of the god of love,
p93
aVor rather in the name of seduction capital.
p94
aa(lp95
VIn light of this observation on contemporary love,
p96
aVhow can we think of love in the years to come?
p97
aVWe can envision two hypotheses:
p98
aVThe first one consists of betting
p99
aVthat this process of narcissistic  capitalization will intensify.
p100
aVIt is hard to say what shape  this intensification will take,
p101
aVbecause it largely depends
p102
aVon social and technical innovations,
p103
aVwhich are by definition difficult to predict.
p104
aVBut we can, for instance,
p105
aVimagine a dating website
p106
aVwhich, a bit like those loyalty points programs,
p107
aVuses seduction capital points
p108
aVthat vary according to my age,  my height/weight ratio,
p109
aVmy degree, my salary,
p110
aVor the number of clicks on my profile.
p111
aVWe can also imagine
p112
aVa chemical treatment for breakups
p113
aVthat weakens the feelings of attachment.
p114
aa(lp115
VBy the way, there's a program on MTV already
p116
aVin which seduction teachers
p117
aVtreat heartache as a disease.
p118
aVThese teachers call themselves "pick-up artists."
p119
aV"Artist" in French is easy, it means "artiste."
p120
aV"Pick-up" is to pick someone up,
p121
aVbut not just any picking up \u2014 it's picking up chicks.
p122
aVSo they are artists of picking up chicks.
p123
aV(Laughter)
p124
aVAnd they call heartache "one-itis."
p125
aVIn English, "itis" is a suffix that signifies infection.
p126
aVOne-itis can be translated as "an infection from one."
p127
aVIt's a bit disgusting. Indeed, for the pick-up artists,
p128
aVfalling in love with someone
p129
aVis a waste of time,
p130
aVit's squandering your seduction capital,
p131
aVso it must be eliminated
p132
aVlike a disease, like an infection.
p133
aVWe can also envision
p134
aVa romantic use of the genome.
p135
aVEveryone would carry it around
p136
aVand present it like a business card
p137
aVto verify if seduction can progress to reproduction.
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VOf course, this race for seduction,
p141
aVlike every fierce competition,
p142
aVwill create huge disparities  in narcissistic satisfaction,
p143
aVand therefore a lot of loneliness and frustration too.
p144
aVSo we can expect that modernity itself,
p145
aVwhich is the origin of seduction capital, would be called into question.
p146
aVI'm thinking particularly of the reaction
p147
aVof neo-fascist or religious communes.
p148
aVBut such a future doesn't have to be.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnother path to thinking about love may be possible.
p151
aVBut how?
p152
aVHow to renounce the hysterical need to be valued?
p153
aVWell, by becoming aware of my uselessness.
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aVYes,
p156
aVI'm useless.
p157
aVBut rest assured:
p158
aVso are you.
p159
aV(Laughter)
p160
aV(Applause)
p161
aa(lp162
VWe are all useless.
p163
aVThis uselessness is easily demonstrated,
p164
aVbecause in order to be valued
p165
aVI need another to desire me,
p166
aVwhich shows that I do not have any value of my own.
p167
aVI don't have any inherent value.
p168
aVWe all pretend to have an idol;
p169
aVwe all pretend to be an idol for someone else, but actually
p170
aVwe are all impostors, a bit like a man on the street
p171
aVwho appears totally cool and indifferent,
p172
aVwhile he has actually anticipated and calculated
p173
aVso that all eyes are on him.
p174
aa(lp175
VI think that becoming aware
p176
aVof this general imposture
p177
aVthat concerns all of us
p178
aVwould ease our love relationships.
p179
aVIt is because I want to be loved
p180
aVfrom head to toe,
p181
aVjustified in my every choice,
p182
aVthat the seduction hysteria exists.
p183
aVAnd therefore I want to seem perfect
p184
aVso that another can love me.
p185
aVI want them to be perfect
p186
aVso that I can be reassured of my value.
p187
aVIt leads to couples
p188
aVobsessed with performance
p189
aVwho will break up, just like that,
p190
aVat the slightest underachievement.
p191
aa(lp192
VIn contrast to this attitude,
p193
aVI call upon tenderness \u2014 love as tenderness.
p194
aVWhat is tenderness?
p195
aVTo be tender is to accept  the loved one's weaknesses.
p196
aVIt's not about becoming a sad couple of orderlies.
p197
aV(Laughter)
p198
aVThat's pretty bad.
p199
aVOn the contrary,
p200
aVthere's plenty of charm and happiness in tenderness.
p201
aVI refer specifically to a kind of humor that is unfortunately underused.
p202
aVIt is a sort of poetry of deliberate awkwardness.
p203
aa(lp204
VI refer to self-mockery.
p205
aVFor a couple who is no longer sustained, supported
p206
aVby the constraints of tradition,
p207
aVI believe that self-mockery
p208
aVis one of the best means for  the relationship to endure.
