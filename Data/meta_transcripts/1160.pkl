VThis is a representation of your brain,
p4
aVand your brain can be broken into two parts.
p5
aVThere's the left half, which is the logical side,
p6
aVand then the right half,
p7
aVwhich is the intuitive.
p8
aVAnd so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere,
p9
aVthen we can plot our brain.
p10
aVAnd for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical.
p11
aVThis would be someone who's entirely intuitive.
p12
aVSo where would you put your brain on this scale?
p13
aVSome of us may have opted for one of these extremes,
p14
aVbut I think for most people in the audience,
p15
aVyour brain is something like this \u2014
p16
aVwith a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time.
p17
aVIt's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything.
p18
aVYou can be logical and intuitive.
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd so I consider myself one of these people,
p21
aValong with most of the other experimental quantum physicists,
p22
aVwho need a good deal of logic
p23
aVto string together these complex ideas.
p24
aVBut at the same time, we need a good deal of intuition
p25
aVto actually make the experiments work.
p26
aVHow do we develop this intuition? Well we like to play with stuff.
p27
aVSo we go out and play with it, and then we see how it acts,
p28
aVand then we develop our intuition from there.
p29
aVAnd really you do the same thing.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo some intuition
p32
aVthat you may have developed over the years
p33
aVis that one thing is only in one place at a time.
p34
aVI mean, it can sound weird to think about
p35
aVone thing being in two different places at the same time,
p36
aVbut you weren't born with this notion, you developed it.
p37
aVAnd I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop.
p38
aVHe was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it, and he kept falling over.
p39
aVBut I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson,
p40
aVand that's that large things don't let you get right past them,
p41
aVand that they stay in one place.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world,
p44
aVunless you're a particle physicist.
p45
aVIt'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist,
p46
aVbecause they don't play with car stops,
p47
aVthey play with these little weird particles.
p48
aVAnd when they play with their particles,
p49
aVthey find they do all sorts of really weird things \u2014
p50
aVlike they can fly right through walls,
p51
aVor they can be in two different places at the same time.
p52
aVAnd so they wrote down all these observations,
p53
aVand they called it the theory of quantum mechanics.
p54
aa(lp55
VAnd so that's where physics was at a few years ago;
p56
aVyou needed quantum mechanics
p57
aVto describe little, tiny particles.
p58
aVBut you didn't need it
p59
aVto describe the large, everyday objects around us.
p60
aVThis didn't really sit well with my intuition,
p61
aVand maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often.
p62
aVWell, I play with them sometimes,
p63
aVbut not very often.
p64
aVAnd I've never seen them.
p65
aVI mean, nobody's ever seen a particle.
p66
aVBut it didn't sit well with my logical side either.
p67
aVBecause if everything is made up of little particles
p68
aVand all the little particles
p69
aVfollow quantum mechanics,
p70
aVthen shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics?
p71
aVI don't see any reason why it shouldn't.
p72
aVAnd so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing
p73
aVif we could somehow show
p74
aVthat an everyday object
p75
aValso follows quantum mechanics.
p76
aVSo a few years ago, I set off to do just that.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo I made one.
p79
aVThis is the first object
p80
aVthat you can see
p81
aVthat has been in a mechanical quantum superposition.
p82
aVSo what we're looking at here
p83
aVis a tiny computer chip.
p84
aVAnd you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle.
p85
aVAnd that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute.
p86
aVThis is a photograph of the object.
p87
aVAnd here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center.
p88
aVAnd then here's a really, really big close-up of the little piece of metal.
p89
aVSo what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal,
p90
aVand it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a ledge.
p91
aVAnd so I made this thing
p92
aVin nearly the same way as you make a computer chip.
p93
aVI went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer,
p94
aVand then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours.
p95
aVFor the last stuff, I had to build my own machine \u2014
p96
aVto make this swimming pool-shaped hole
p97
aVunderneath the device.
p98
aVThis device has the ability
p99
aVto be in a quantum superposition,
p100
aVbut it needs a little help to do it.
p101
aa(lp102
VHere, let me give you an analogy.
p103
aVYou know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator?
p104
aVI mean, when I'm in an elevator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things,
p105
aVbut then other people get on board
p106
aVand I stop doing those things
p107
aVbecause I don't want to bother them,
p108
aVor, frankly, scare them.
p109
aVSo quantum mechanics says
p110
aVthat inanimate objects feel the same way.
p111
aVThe fellow passengers for inanimate objects
p112
aVare not just people,
p113
aVbut it's also the light shining on it
p114
aVand the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room.
p115
aVAnd so we knew, if we wanted to see
p116
aVthis piece of metal behave quantum mechanically,
p117
aVwe're going to have to kick out all the other passengers.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd so that's what we did.
p120
aVWe turned off the lights,
p121
aVand then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air,
p122
aVand then we cooled it down
p123
aVto just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero.
p124
aVNow, all alone in the elevator,
p125
aVthe little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted.
p126
aVAnd so we measured its motion.
p127
aVWe found it was moving in really weird ways.
p128
aVInstead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating,
p129
aVand the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this \u2014
p130
aVlike expanding and contracting bellows.
p131
aVAnd by giving it a gentle nudge,
p132
aVwe were able to make it both vibrate
p133
aVand not vibrate
p134
aVat the same time \u2014
p135
aVsomething that's only allowed with quantum mechanics.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic.
p138
aVWhat does it mean for one thing
p139
aVto be both vibrating and not vibrating
p140
aVat the same time?
p141
aVSo let's think about the atoms.
p142
aVSo in one case:
p143
aVall the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal
p144
aVare sitting still
p145
aVand at the same time those same atoms
p146
aVare moving up and down.
p147
aVNow it's only at precise times when they align.
p148
aVThe rest of the time they're delocalized.
p149
aVThat means that every atom
p150
aVis in two different places at the same time,
p151
aVwhich in turn means the entire chunk of metal
p152
aVis in two different places.
p153
aVI think this is really cool.
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aVReally.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Applause)
p158
aa(lp159
VIt was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years
p160
aVbecause, check this out,
p161
aVthe difference in scale
p162
aVbetween a single atom and that chunk of metal
p163
aVis about the same as the difference
p164
aVbetween that chunk of metal and you.
p165
aVSo if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time,
p166
aVthat chunk of metal can be in two different places,
p167
aVthen why not you?
p168
aVI mean, this is just my logical side talking.
p169
aVSo imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time,
p170
aVwhat would that be like?
p171
aVHow would your consciousness
p172
aVhandle your body being delocalized in space?
p173
aa(lp174
VThere's one more part to the story.
p175
aVIt's when we warmed it up,
p176
aVand we turned on the lights and looked inside the box,
p177
aVwe saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece.
p178
aVAnd so I had to develop this new intuition,
p179
aVthat it seems like all the objects in the elevator
p180
aVare really just quantum objects
p181
aVjust crammed into a tiny space.
p182
aa(lp183
VYou hear a lot of talk
p184
aVabout how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected.
p185
aVWell, that's not quite right.
p186
aVIt's more than that; it's deeper.
p187
aVIt's that those connections,
p188
aVyour connections to all the things around you,
p189
aVliterally define who you are,
p190
aVand that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics.
