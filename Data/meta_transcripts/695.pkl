VOnce upon a time,
p4
aVat the age of 24,
p5
aVI was a student at St. John's Medical College in Bangalore.
p6
aVI was a guest student during one month
p7
aVof a public health course.
p8
aVAnd that changed my mindset forever.
p9
aVThe course was good, but it was not the course content
p10
aVin itself that changed the mindset.
p11
aVIt was the brutal realization,
p12
aVthe first morning,
p13
aVthat the Indian students were better than me.
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VYou see, I was a study nerd.
p18
aVI loved statistics from a young age.
p19
aVAnd I studied very much in Sweden.
p20
aVI used to be in the upper quarter of all courses I attended.
p21
aVBut in St. John's, I was in the lower quarter.
p22
aVAnd the fact was that Indian students
p23
aVstudied harder than we did in Sweden.
p24
aVThey read the textbook twice,
p25
aVor three times or four times.
p26
aVIn Sweden we read it once and then we went partying.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laugher)
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd that, to me,
p31
aVthat personal experience
p32
aVwas the first time in my life
p33
aVthat the mindset I grew up with
p34
aVwas changed.
p35
aVAnd I realized that perhaps
p36
aVthe Western world will not continue
p37
aVto dominate the world forever.
p38
aVAnd I think many of you have the same sort of personal experience.
p39
aVIt's that realization of someone you meet
p40
aVthat really made you change your ideas about the world.
p41
aVIt's not the statistics, although I tried to make it funny.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd I will now,
p44
aVhere, onstage,
p45
aVtry to predict when that will happen \u2014
p46
aVthat Asia will regain
p47
aVits dominant position
p48
aVas the leading part of the world,
p49
aVas it used to be, over thousands of years.
p50
aVAnd I will do that
p51
aVby trying to predict precisely
p52
aVat what year
p53
aVthe average income per person
p54
aVin India, in China, will reach that of the West.
p55
aVAnd I don't mean the whole economy,
p56
aVbecause to grow an economy
p57
aVof India to the size of U.K. \u2014
p58
aVthat's a piece of cake, with one billion people.
p59
aVBut I want to see when will the average pay, the money
p60
aVfor each person, per month,
p61
aVin India and China,
p62
aVwhen will that have reached that of U.K. and the United States?
p63
aa(lp64
VBut I will start with a historical background.
p65
aVAnd you can see my map if I get it up here. You know?
p66
aVI will start at 1858.
p67
aV1858 was a year of great technological
p68
aVadvancement in the West.
p69
aVThat was the year when Queen Victoria
p70
aVwas able, for the first time, to communicate
p71
aVwith President Buchanan,
p72
aVthrough the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable.
p73
aVAnd they were the first to "Twitter" transatlantically.
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aV(Applause)
p76
aVAnd I've been able, through this wonderful Google and Internet,
p77
aVto find the text of the telegram
p78
aVsent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria.
p79
aVAnd it ends like this: "This telegraph
p80
aVis a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion,
p81
aVcivilization, liberty and law throughout the world."
p82
aa(lp83
VThose are nice words. But I got sort of curious
p84
aVof what he meant with liberty, and liberty for whom.
p85
aVAnd we will think about that
p86
aVwhen we look at the wider picture of the world in 1858.
p87
aVBecause 1858
p88
aVwas also watershed year
p89
aVin the history of Asia.
p90
aV1858 was the year
p91
aVwhen the courageous uprising
p92
aVagainst the foreign occupation of India
p93
aVwas defeated by the British forces.
p94
aVAnd India was up to 89 years more of foreign domination.
p95
aa(lp96
V1858 in China
p97
aVwas the victory in the Opium War by the British forces.
p98
aVAnd that meant that foreigners, as it said in the treaty,
p99
aVwere allowed to trade freely in China.
p100
aVIt meant paying with opium for Chinese goods.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd 1858 in Japan
p103
aVwas the year when Japan had to sign the Harris Treaty
p104
aVand accept trade on favorable condition for the U.S.
p105
aVAnd they were threatened by those black ships there,
p106
aVthat had been in Tokyo harbor over the last year.
p107
aVBut, Japan, in contrast to India and China,
p108
aVmaintained its national sovereignty.
p109
aa(lp110
VAnd let's see how much difference that can make.
p111
aVAnd I will do that by bringing these bubbles
p112
aVback to a Gapminder graph here,
p113
aVwhere you can see each bubble is a country.
p114
aVThe size of the bubble here is the population.
p115
aVOn this axis, as I used to have income per person in comparable dollar.
p116
aVAnd on that axis I have life expectancy, the health of people.
p117
aVAnd I also bring an innovation here.
p118
aVI have transformed the laser beam
p119
aVinto an ecological, recyclable version here, in green India.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Applause)
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd we will see, you know.
p124
aVLook here, 1858, India was here,
p125
aVChina was here, Japan was there,
p126
aVUnited States and United Kingdom
p127
aVwas richer over there.
p128
aVAnd I will start the world like this.
p129
aVIndia was not always like this level.
p130
aVActually if we go back into the historical record,
p131
aVthere was a time hundreds of years ago
p132
aVwhen the income per person in India and China
p133
aVwas even above that of Europe.
p134
aVBut 1850 had already been many, many years of foreign domination,
p135
aVand India had been de-industrialized.
p136
aVAnd you can see that the countries who were growing
p137
aVtheir economy was United States and United Kingdom.
p138
aVAnd they were also, by the end of the century, getting healthy,
p139
aVand Japan was starting to catch up.
p140
aVIndia was trying down here.
p141
aVCan you see how it starts to move there?
p142
aVBut really, really natural sovereignty was good for Japan.
p143
aVAnd Japan is trying to move up there.
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd it's the new century now. Health is getting better,
p146
aVUnited Kingdom, United States.
p147
aVBut careful now \u2014 we are approaching the First World War.
p148
aVAnd the First World War, you know,
p149
aVwe'll see a lot of deaths and economical problems here.
p150
aVUnited Kingdom is going down.
p151
aVAnd now comes the Spanish flu also.
p152
aVAnd then after the First World War, they continue up.
p153
aVStill under foreign domination, and without sovereignty,
p154
aVIndia and China are down in the corner.
p155
aVNot much has happened.
p156
aVThey have grown their population but not much more.
p157
aVIn the 1930's now, you can see
p158
aVthat Japan is going to a period of war,
p159
aVwith lower life expectancy.
p160
aVAnd the Second World War was really a terrible event,
p161
aValso economically for Japan.
p162
aVBut they did recover quite fast afterwards.
p163
aVAnd we are moving into the new world.
p164
aVIn 1947 India finally
p165
aVgained its independence.
p166
aVAnd they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation,
p167
aVbut in very big difficulties down there.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Applause)
p170
aa(lp171
VIn 1949 we saw the emergence of the modern China
p172
aVin a way which surprised the world.
p173
aVAnd what happened?
p174
aVWhat happens in the after independence?
p175
aVYou can see that the health started to improve.
p176
aVChildren started to go to school.
p177
aVHealth services were provided.
p178
aVThis is the Great Leap Forward, when China fell down.
p179
aVIt was central planning by Mao Tse Tung.
p180
aVChina recovered. Then they said,
p181
aV"Nevermore, stupid central planning."
p182
aVBut they went up here, and India was trying to follow.
p183
aVAnd they were catching up indeed.
p184
aVAnd both countries had the better health, but still
p185
aVa very low economy.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd we came to 1978, and Mao Tse Tung died,
p188
aVand a new guy turned up from the left.
p189
aVAnd it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here.
p190
aVAnd he said, "Doesn't matter
p191
aVif a cat is white or black,
p192
aVas long as it catches mice."
p193
aVBecause catching mice
p194
aVis what the two cats wanted to do.
p195
aVAnd you can see the two cats being here,
p196
aVChina and India, wanting to catch the mices over there, you know.
p197
aVAnd they decided to go not only for health and education,
p198
aVbut also starting to grow their economy.
p199
aVAnd the market reformer was successful there.
p200
aVIn '92 India follows with a market reform.
p201
aVAnd they go quite closely together,
p202
aVand you can see that the similarity with India and China,
p203
aVin many ways, are greater than the differences with them.
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd here they march on. And will they catch up?
p206
aa(lp207
VThis is the big question today.
p208
aVThere they are today.
p209
aa(lp210
VNow what does it mean that the \u2014
p211
aV(Applause)
p212
aVthe averages there \u2014 this is the average of China.
p213
aVIf I would split China, look here,
p214
aVShanghai has already catched up.
p215
aVShanghai is already there.
p216
aVAnd it's healthier than the United States.
p217
aVBut on the other hand, Guizhou, one of the poorest
p218
aVinland provinces of China, is there.
p219
aVAnd if I split Guizhou into urban and rural,
p220
aVthe rural part of Guizhou goes down there.
p221
aVYou see this enormous inequity in China,
p222
aVin the midst of fast economic growth.
p223
aa(lp224
VAnd if I would also look at India,
p225
aVyou have another type of inequity, actually, in India.
p226
aVThe geographical, macro-geographical difference is not so big.
p227
aVUttar Pradesh, the biggest of the states here,
p228
aVis poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India.
p229
aVKerala is flying on top there,
p230
aVmatching United States in health,
p231
aVbut not in economy.
p232
aVAnd here, Maharashtra, with Mumbai,
p233
aVis forging forward.
p234
aVNow in India, the big inequities are within the state,
p235
aVrather than between the states.
p236
aVAnd that is not a bad thing, in itself.
p237
aVIf you have a lot inequity, macro-geographical inequities
p238
aVcan be more difficult in the long term to deal with,
p239
aVthan if it is in the same area where you have a growth center
p240
aVrelatively close to where poor people are living.
p241
aa(lp242
VNo, there is one more inequity. Look there, United States.
p243
aV(Laughter)
p244
aVOh, they broke my frame.
p245
aVWashington, D.C. went out here.
p246
aVMy friends at Gapminder wanted me to show this
p247
aVbecause there is a new leader in Washington
p248
aVwho is really concerned about the health system.
p249
aVAnd I can understand him, because Washington, D.C.
p250
aVis so rich over there
p251
aVbut they are not as healthy as Kerala.
p252
aVIt's quite interesting, isn't it?
p253
aV(Applause)
p254
aVI can see a business opportunity for Kerala,
p255
aVhelping fix the health system in the United States.
p256
aa(lp257
V(Laughter)
p258
aa(lp259
V(Applause)
p260
aa(lp261
VNow here we have the whole world. You have the legend down there.
p262
aVAnd when you see the two giant cats here, pushing forward,
p263
aVyou see that in between them
p264
aVand ahead of them,
p265
aVis the whole emerging economies of the world,
p266
aVwhich Thomas Friedman so correctly called the "flat world."
p267
aVYou can see that in health and education,
p268
aVa large part of the world population is putting forward,
p269
aVbut in Africa, and other parts,
p270
aVas in rural Guizhou in China,
p271
aVthere is still people with low health and very low economy.
p272
aVWe have an enormous disparity in the world.
p273
aVBut most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast.
p274
aa(lp275
VNow, back to my projections.
p276
aVWhen will it catch up? I have to go back to very conventional graph.
p277
aVI will show income per person on this axis instead,
p278
aVpoor down here, rich up there.
p279
aVAnd then time here, from 1858
p280
aVI start the world.
p281
aVAnd we shall see what will happen with these countries.
p282
aVYou see, China under foreign domination
p283
aVactually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here.
p284
aVWhereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer.
p285
aVAnd after Second World War, United States is richer than U.K.
p286
aVBut independence is coming here.
p287
aVGrowth is starting, economic reform.
p288
aVGrowth is faster, and with projection from IMF
p289
aVyou can see where you expect them to be in 2014.
p290
aa(lp291
VNow, the question is, "When will the catch up take place?"
p292
aVLook at, look at the United States.
p293
aVCan you see the bubble?
p294
aVThe bubbles, not my bubbles,
p295
aVbut the financial bubbles.
p296
aVThat's the dot com bubble. This is the Lehman Brothers doorstep there.
p297
aVYou see it came down there.
p298
aVAnd it seems this is another rock coming down there, you know.
p299
aVSo they doesn't seem to go this way, these countries.
p300
aVThey seem to go in a more humble growth way, you know.
p301
aVAnd people interested in growth
p302
aVare turning their eyes towards Asia.
p303
aa(lp304
VI can compare to Japan. This is Japan coming up.
p305
aVYou see, Japan did it like that.
p306
aVWe add Japan to it.
p307
aVAnd there is no doubt that fast catch up
p308
aVcan take place.
p309
aVCan you see here what Japan did?
p310
aVJapan did it like this, until full catch up,
p311
aVand then they follow with the other high-income economies.
p312
aVBut the real projections for those ones,
p313
aVI would like to give it like this.
p314
aVCan be worse, can be better.
p315
aVIt's always difficult to predict, especially about the future.
p316
aVNow, a historian tells me it's even more difficult to predict about the past.
p317
aa(lp318
V(Laughter)
p319
aa(lp320
VI think I'm in a difficult position here.
p321
aVInequalities in China and India
p322
aVI consider really the big obstacle
p323
aVbecause to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity
p324
aVis what will create a domestic market,
p325
aVwhat will avoid social instability,
p326
aVand which will make use of the entire capacity
p327
aVof the population.
p328
aVSo, social investments in health, education and infrastructure,
p329
aVand electricity is really what is needed in India and China.
p330
aa(lp331
VYou know the climate. We have great international experts
p332
aVwithin India telling us that the climate is changing,
p333
aVand actions has to be taken,
p334
aVotherwise China and India would be the countries
p335
aVmost to suffer from climate change.
p336
aVAnd I consider India and China the best partners in the world
p337
aVin a good global climate policy.
p338
aVBut they ain't going to pay
p339
aVfor what others, who have more money,
p340
aVhave largely created, and I can agree on that.
p341
aa(lp342
VBut what I'm really worried about is war.
p343
aVWill the former rich countries really accept
p344
aVa completely changed world economy,
p345
aVand a shift of power away from where it has been
p346
aVthe last 50 to 100 to 150 years,
p347
aVback to Asia?
p348
aVAnd will Asia be able to handle that
p349
aVnew position of being in charge
p350
aVof being the most mighty, and the governors of the world?
p351
aVSo, always avoid war,
p352
aVbecause that always pushes human beings backward.
p353
aVNow if these inequalities, climate and war can be avoided,
p354
aVget ready for a world in equity,
p355
aVbecause this is what seems to be happening.
p356
aa(lp357
VAnd that vision that I got as a young student,
p358
aV1972, that Indians can be much better than Swedes,
p359
aVis just about to happen.
p360
aVAnd it will happen precisely
p361
aVthe year 2048
p362
aVin the later part of the summer, in July,
p363
aVmore precisely, the 27th of July.
p364
aV(Applause)
p365
aVThe 27th of July, 2048
p366
aVis my 100th birthday.
p367
aV(Laughter)
p368
aVAnd I expect to speak
p369
aVin the first session of the 39th TED India.
p370
aVGet your bookings in time. Thank you very much.
