VLast year I showed these two slides so that
p4
aVdemonstrate that the arctic ice cap,
p5
aVwhich for most of the last three million years
p6
aVhas been the size of the lower 48 states,
p7
aVhas shrunk by 40 percent.
p8
aVBut this understates the seriousness of this particular problem
p9
aVbecause it doesn't show the thickness of the ice.
p10
aVThe arctic ice cap is, in a sense,
p11
aVthe beating heart of the global climate system.
p12
aVIt expands in winter and contracts in summer.
p13
aVThe next slide I show you will be
p14
aVa rapid fast-forward of what's happened over the last 25 years.
p15
aVThe permanent ice is marked in red.
p16
aVAs you see, it expands to the dark blue \u2014
p17
aVthat's the annual ice in winter,
p18
aVand it contracts in summer.
p19
aVThe so-called permanent ice, five years old or older,
p20
aVyou can see is almost like blood,
p21
aVspilling out of the body here.
p22
aVIn 25 years it's gone from this, to this.
p23
aa(lp24
VThis is a problem because the warming
p25
aVheats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean,
p26
aVwhere there is a massive amount of frozen carbon
p27
aVwhich, when it thaws, is turned into methane by microbes.
p28
aVCompared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere,
p29
aVthat amount could double if we cross this tipping point.
p30
aVAlready in some shallow lakes in Alaska,
p31
aVmethane is actively bubbling up out of the water.
p32
aVProfessor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska
p33
aVwent out with another team to another shallow lake last winter.
p34
aVVideo: Whoa! (Laughter)
p35
aVAl Gore: She's okay. The question is whether we will be.
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd one reason is, this enormous heat sink
p38
aVheats up Greenland from the north.
p39
aVThis is an annual melting river.
p40
aVBut the volumes are much larger than ever.
p41
aVThis is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland.
p42
aVIf you want to know how sea level rises
p43
aVfrom land-base ice melting
p44
aVthis is where it reaches the sea.
p45
aVThese flows are increasing very rapidly.
p46
aVAt the other end of the planet, Antarctica
p47
aVthe largest mass of ice on the planet.
p48
aVLast month scientists reported the entire continent
p49
aVis now in negative ice balance.
p50
aVAnd west Antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands,
p51
aVis particularly rapid in its melting.
p52
aVThat's equal to 20 feet of sea level, as is Greenland.
p53
aa(lp54
VIn the Himalayas, the third largest mass of ice:
p55
aVat the top you see new lakes, which a few years ago were glaciers.
p56
aV40 percent of all the people in the world
p57
aVget half of their drinking water from that melting flow.
p58
aVIn the Andes, this glacier is the
p59
aVsource of drinking water for this city.
p60
aVThe flows have increased.
p61
aVBut when they go away, so does much of the drinking water.
p62
aVIn California there has been a 40 percent
p63
aVdecline in the Sierra snowpack.
p64
aVThis is hitting the reservoirs.
p65
aVAnd the predictions, as you've read, are serious.
p66
aa(lp67
VThis drying around the world has lead to
p68
aVa dramatic increase in fires.
p69
aVAnd the disasters around the world
p70
aVhave been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary
p71
aVand unprecedented rate.
p72
aVFour times as many in the last 30 years
p73
aVas in the previous 75.
p74
aVThis is a completely unsustainable pattern.
p75
aVIf you look at in the context of history
p76
aVyou can see what this is doing.
p77
aa(lp78
VIn the last five years
p79
aVwe've added 70 million tons of CO2
p80
aVevery 24 hours \u2014
p81
aV25 million tons every day to the oceans.
p82
aVLook carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific,
p83
aVfrom the Americas, extending westward,
p84
aVand on either side of the Indian subcontinent,
p85
aVwhere there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans.
p86
aVThe biggest single cause of global warming,
p87
aValong with deforestation, which is 20 percent of it, is the burning of fossil fuels.
p88
aVOil is a problem, and coal is the most serious problem.
p89
aVThe United States is one of the two
p90
aVlargest emitters, along with China.
p91
aVAnd the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants.
p92
aa(lp93
VBut we're beginning to see a sea change.
p94
aVHere are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years
p95
aVwith some green alternatives proposed.
p96
aV(Applause)
p97
aVHowever there is a political battle
p98
aVin our country.
p99
aVAnd the coal industries and the oil industries
p100
aVspent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year
p101
aVpromoting clean coal,
p102
aVwhich is an oxymoron.
p103
aVThat image reminded me of something.
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aVAround Christmas, in my home in Tennessee,
p106
aVa billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled.
p107
aVYou probably saw it on the news.
p108
aVThis, all over the country, is the second largest waste stream in America.
p109
aVThis happened around Christmas.
p110
aVOne of the coal industry's ads around Christmas was this one.
p111
aa(lp112
VVideo: \u266a\u266b Frosty the coal man is a jolly, happy soul.
p113
aVHe's abundant here in America,
p114
aVand he helps our economy grow.
p115
aVFrosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday.
p116
aVHe's affordable and adorable, and workers keep their pay.
p117
aa(lp118
VAl Gore: This is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia.
p119
aVThe largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal.
p120
aa(lp121
VVideo: Don Blankenship: Let me be clear about it. Al Gore,
p122
aVNancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don't know what they're talking about.
p123
aa(lp124
VAl Gore: So the Alliance for Climate Protection
p125
aVhas launched two campaigns.
p126
aVThis is one of them, part of one of them.
p127
aa(lp128
VVideo: Actor: At COALergy we view climate change as a very serious
p129
aVthreat to our business.
p130
aVThat's why we've made it our primary goal
p131
aVto spend a large sum of money
p132
aVon an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate
p133
aVthe truth about coal.
p134
aVThe fact is, coal isn't dirty.
p135
aVWe think it's clean \u2014
p136
aVsmells good, too.
p137
aVSo don't worry about climate change.
p138
aVLeave that up to us.
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VVideo: Actor: Clean coal \u2014 you've heard a lot about it.
p142
aVSo let's take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility.
p143
aVAmazing! The machinery is kind of loud.
p144
aVBut that's the sound of clean coal technology.
p145
aVAnd while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming,
p146
aVthe remarkable clean coal technology you see here
p147
aVchanges everything.
p148
aVTake a good long look: this is today's clean coal technology.
p149
aa(lp150
VAl Gore: Finally, the positive alternative
p151
aVmeshes with our economic challenge
p152
aVand our national security challenge.
p153
aa(lp154
VVideo: Narrator: America is in crisis \u2014 the economy,
p155
aVnational security, the climate crisis.
p156
aVThe thread that links them all:
p157
aVour addiction to carbon based fuels,
p158
aVlike dirty coal and foreign oil.
p159
aVBut now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess.
p160
aVRepower America with 100 percent clean electricity
p161
aVwithin 10 years.
p162
aVA plan to put America back to work,
p163
aVmake us more secure, and help stop global warming.
p164
aVFinally, a solution that's big enough to solve our problems.
p165
aVRepower America. Find out more.
p166
aa(lp167
VAl Gore: This is the last one.
p168
aa(lp169
VVideo: Narrator: It's about repowering America.
p170
aVOne of the fastest ways to cut our dependence
p171
aVon old dirty fuels that are killing our planet.
p172
aVMan: Future's over here. Wind, sun, a new energy grid.
p173
aVMan #2: New investments to create high-paying jobs.
p174
aVNarrator: Repower America. It's time to get real.
p175
aa(lp176
VAl Gore: There is an old African proverb that says,
p177
aV"If you want to go quickly, go alone.
p178
aVIf you want to go far, go together."
p179
aVWe need to go far, quickly.
p180
aVThank you very much.
