VWhen I was little \u2014
p4
aVand by the way, I was little once \u2014
p5
aVmy father told me a story
p6
aVabout an 18th century watchmaker.
p7
aVAnd what this guy had done:
p8
aVhe used to produce these fabulously beautiful watches.
p9
aVAnd one day, one of his customers came into his workshop
p10
aVand asked him to clean the watch that he'd bought.
p11
aVAnd the guy took it apart,
p12
aVand one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels.
p13
aVAnd as he did so, his customer noticed
p14
aVthat on the back side of the balance wheel was an engraving,
p15
aVwere words.
p16
aVAnd he said to the guy,
p17
aV"Why have you put stuff on the back
p18
aVthat no one will ever see?"
p19
aVAnd the watchmaker turned around and said,
p20
aV"God can see it."
p21
aVNow I'm not in the least bit religious,
p22
aVneither was my father,
p23
aVbut at that point, I noticed something happening here.
p24
aVI felt something
p25
aVin this plexus of blood vessels and nerves,
p26
aVand there must be some muscles in there as well somewhere, I guess.
p27
aVBut I felt something.
p28
aVAnd it was a physiological response.
p29
aVAnd from that point on, from my age at the time,
p30
aVI began to think of things in a different way.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd as I took on my career as a designer,
p33
aVI began to ask myself the simple question:
p34
aVDo we actually think beauty,
p35
aVor do we feel it?
p36
aVNow you probably know the answer to this already.
p37
aVYou probably think, well, I don't know which one you think it is,
p38
aVbut I think it's about feeling beauty.
p39
aVAnd so I then moved on into my design career
p40
aVand began to find some exciting things.
p41
aVOne of the most early work was done in automotive design \u2014
p42
aVsome very exciting work was done there.
p43
aVAnd during a lot of this work,
p44
aVwe found something, or I found something,
p45
aVthat really fascinated me, and maybe you can remember it.
p46
aVDo you remember when lights used to just go on and off,
p47
aVclick click, when you closed the door in a car?
p48
aVAnd then somebody, I think it was BMW,
p49
aVintroduced a light that went out slowly.
p50
aVRemember that?
p51
aVI remember it clearly.
p52
aVDo you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that?
p53
aVI remember sitting there thinking, this is fantastic.
p54
aVIn fact, I've never found anybody
p55
aVthat doesn't like the light that goes out slowly.
p56
aVI thought, well what the hell's that about?
p57
aa(lp58
VSo I started to ask myself questions about it.
p59
aVAnd the first was, I'd ask other people: "Do you like it?" "Yes."
p60
aV"Why?" And they'd say, "Oh, it feels so natural,"
p61
aVor, "It's nice."
p62
aVI thought, well that's not good enough.
p63
aVCan we cut down a little bit further,
p64
aVbecause, as a designer, I need the vocabulary, I need the keyboard,
p65
aVof how this actually works.
p66
aVAnd so I did some experiments.
p67
aVAnd I suddenly realized
p68
aVthat there was something that did exactly that \u2014
p69
aVlight to dark in six seconds \u2014
p70
aVexactly that.
p71
aVDo you know what it is? Anyone?
p72
aa(lp73
VYou see, using this bit, the thinky bit,
p74
aVthe slow bit of the brain \u2014 using that.
p75
aVAnd this isn't a think, it's a feel.
p76
aVAnd would you do me a favor?
p77
aVFor the next 14 minutes or whatever it is,
p78
aVwill you feel stuff?
p79
aa(lp80
VI don't need you to think so much as I want you to feel it.
p81
aVI felt a sense of relaxation
p82
aVtempered with anticipation.
p83
aVAnd that thing that I found
p84
aVwas the cinema or the theater.
p85
aVIt's actually just happened here \u2014
p86
aVlight to dark in six seconds.
p87
aVAnd when that happens, are you sitting there going,
p88
aV"No, the movie's about to start,"
p89
aVor are you going, "That's fantastic. I'm looking forward to it.
p90
aVI get a sense of anticipation"?
p91
aVNow I'm not a neuroscientist.
p92
aVI don't know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex.
p93
aVBut it might be.
p94
aVBecause the people I speak to in the northern hemisphere
p95
aVthat used to go in the cinema get this.
p96
aVAnd some of the people I speak to
p97
aVthat have never seen a movie or been to the theater
p98
aVdon't get it in the same way.
p99
aVEverybody likes it,
p100
aVbut some like it more than others.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo this leads me to think of this in a different way.
p103
aVWe're not feeling it. We're thinking beauty is in the limbic system \u2014
p104
aVif that's not an outmoded idea.
p105
aVThese are the bits, the pleasure centers,
p106
aVand maybe what I'm seeing and sensing and feeling
p107
aVis bypassing my thinking.
p108
aVThe wiring from your sensory apparatus to those bits
p109
aVis shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thinky bit, the cortex.
p110
aVThey arrive first.
p111
aVSo how do we make that actually work?
p112
aVAnd how much of that reactive side of it
p113
aVis due to what we already know,
p114
aVor what we're going to learn, about something?
p115
aa(lp116
VThis is one of the most beautiful things I know.
p117
aVIt's a plastic bag.
p118
aVAnd when I looked at it first, I thought, no, there's no beauty in that.
p119
aVThen I found out,
p120
aVpost exposure,
p121
aVthat this plastic bag if I put it into a filthy puddle
p122
aVor a stream filled with coliforms
p123
aVand all sorts of disgusting stuff,
p124
aVthat that filthy water
p125
aVwill migrate through the wall of the bag by osmosis
p126
aVand end up inside it as pure, potable drinking water.
p127
aVAnd all of a sudden, this plastic bag
p128
aVwas extremely beautiful to me.
p129
aa(lp130
VNow I'm going to ask you again
p131
aVto switch on the emotional bit.
p132
aVWould you mind taking the brain out,
p133
aVand I just want you to feel something.
p134
aVLook at that. What are you feeling about it?
p135
aVIs it beautiful? Is it exciting?
p136
aVI'm watching your faces very carefully.
p137
aVThere's some rather bored-looking gentlemen
p138
aVand some slightly engaged-looking ladies
p139
aVwho are picking up something off that.
p140
aVMaybe there's an innocence to it.
p141
aVNow I'm going to tell you what it is. Are you ready?
p142
aVThis is the last act on this Earth
p143
aVof a little girl called Heidi, five years old,
p144
aVbefore she died of cancer to the spine.
p145
aVIt's the last thing she did,
p146
aVthe last physical act.
p147
aVLook at that picture.
p148
aVLook at the innocence. Look at the beauty in it.
p149
aVIs it beautiful now?
p150
aa(lp151
VStop. Stop. How do you feel?
p152
aVWhere are you feeling this?
p153
aVI'm feeling it here. I feel it here.
p154
aVAnd I'm watching your faces,
p155
aVbecause your faces are telling me something.
p156
aVThe lady over there is actually crying, by the way.
p157
aVBut what are you doing?
p158
aVI watch what people do.
p159
aVI watch faces.
p160
aVI watch reactions.
p161
aVBecause I have to know how people react to things.
p162
aVAnd one of the most common faces
p163
aVon something faced with beauty,
p164
aVsomething stupefyingly delicious,
p165
aVis what I call the OMG.
p166
aVAnd by the way, there's no pleasure in that face.
p167
aVIt's not a "this is wonderful!"
p168
aVThe eyebrows are doing this, the eyes are defocused,
p169
aVand the mouth is hanging open.
p170
aVThat's not the expression of joy.
p171
aVThere's something else in that.
p172
aVThere's something weird happening.
p173
aVSo pleasure seems to be tempered
p174
aVby a whole series of different things coming in.
p175
aa(lp176
VPoignancy is a word I love as a designer.
p177
aVIt means something triggering a big emotional response,
p178
aVoften quite a sad emotional response,
p179
aVbut it's part of what we do.
p180
aVIt isn't just about nice.
p181
aVAnd this is the dilemma, this is the paradox, of beauty.
p182
aVSensorily, we're taking in all sorts of things \u2014
p183
aVmixtures of things that are good, bad, exciting, frightening \u2014
p184
aVto come up with that sensorial exposure,
p185
aVthat sensation of what's going on.
p186
aVPathos appears obviously
p187
aVas part of what you just saw in that little girl's drawing.
p188
aVAnd also triumph, this sense of transcendence,
p189
aVthis "I never knew that. Ah, this is something new."
p190
aVAnd that's packed in there as well.
p191
aVAnd as we assemble these tools,
p192
aVfrom a design point of view, I get terribly excited about it,
p193
aVbecause these are things, as we've already said,
p194
aVthey're arriving at the brain, it would seem,
p195
aVbefore cognition, before we can manipulate them \u2014
p196
aVelectrochemical party tricks.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow what I'm also interested in is:
p199
aVIs it possible to separate
p200
aVintrinsic and extrinsic beauty?
p201
aVBy that, I mean intrinsically beautiful things,
p202
aVjust something that's exquisitely beautiful,
p203
aVthat's universally beautiful.
p204
aVVery hard to find. Maybe you've got some examples of it.
p205
aVVery hard to find something that, to everybody,
p206
aVis a very beautiful thing,
p207
aVwithout a certain amount of information packed in there before.
p208
aVSo a lot of it tends to be extrinsic.
p209
aVIt's mediated by information before the comprehension.
p210
aVOr the information's added on at the back,
p211
aVlike that little girl's drawing that I showed you.
p212
aa(lp213
VNow when talking about beauty
p214
aVyou can't get away from the fact
p215
aVthat a lot experiments have been done in this way
p216
aVwith faces and what have you.
p217
aVAnd one of the most tedious ones, I think,
p218
aVwas saying that beauty was about symmetry.
p219
aVWell it obviously isn't.
p220
aVThis is a more interesting one
p221
aVwhere half faces were shown to some people,
p222
aVand then to add them into a list
p223
aVof most beautiful to least beautiful
p224
aVand then exposing a full face.
p225
aVAnd they found that it was almost exact coincidence.
p226
aVSo it wasn't about symmetry.
p227
aVIn fact, this lady has a particularly asymmetrical face,
p228
aVof which both sides are beautiful.
p229
aVBut they're both different.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd as a designer, I can't help meddling with this,
p232
aVso I pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this,
p233
aVand tried to understand what the individual elements were,
p234
aVbut feeling it as I go.
p235
aVNow I can feel a sensation of delight and beauty
p236
aVif I look at that eye.
p237
aVI'm not getting it off the eyebrow.
p238
aVAnd the earhole isn't doing it to me at all.
p239
aVSo I don't know how much this is helping me,
p240
aVbut it's helping to guide me to the places
p241
aVwhere the signals are coming off.
p242
aVAnd as I say, I'm not a neuroscientist,
p243
aVbut to understand how I can start to assemble things
p244
aVthat will very quickly bypass
p245
aVthis thinking part
p246
aVand get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnais Nin and the Talmud have told us time and time again
p249
aVthat we see things not as they are, but as we are.
p250
aVSo I'm going to shamelessly expose something to you,
p251
aVwhich is beautiful to me.
p252
aVAnd this is the F1 MV Agusta.
p253
aVAhhhh.
p254
aVIt is really \u2014 I mean, I can't express to you
p255
aVhow exquisite this object is.
p256
aVBut I also know why it's exquisite to me,
p257
aVbecause it's a palimpsest of things.
p258
aVIt's masses and masses of layers.
p259
aVThis is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension.
p260
aVIt's something much bigger.
p261
aVLayer after layer of legend, sport, details that resonate.
p262
aVI mean, if I just go through some of them now \u2014
p263
aVI know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects,
p264
aVand that does it consummately well, you can see it can.
p265
aVSo that's getting me excited.
p266
aVAnd I feel that here.
p267
aa(lp268
VThis bit, the big secret of automotive design \u2014
p269
aVreflection management.
p270
aVIt's not about the shapes,
p271
aVit's how the shapes reflect light.
p272
aVNow that thing, light flickers across it as you move,
p273
aVso it becomes a kinetic object,
p274
aVeven though it's standing still \u2014
p275
aVmanaged by how brilliantly that's done on the reflection.
p276
aVThis little relief on the footplate, by the way, to a rider
p277
aVmeans there's something going on underneath it \u2014
p278
aVin this case, a drive chain running at 300 miles and hour probably,
p279
aVtaking the power from the engine.
p280
aVI'm getting terribly excited
p281
aVas my mind and my eyes flick across these things.
p282
aa(lp283
VTitanium lacquer on this.
p284
aVI can't tell you how wonderful this is.
p285
aVThat's how you stop the nuts coming off at high speed on the wheel.
p286
aVI'm really getting into this now.
p287
aVAnd of course, a racing bike doesn't have a prop stand,
p288
aVbut this one, because it's a road bike,
p289
aVit all goes away and it folds into this little gap.
p290
aVSo it disappears.
p291
aVAnd then I can't tell you how hard it is to do that radiator, which is curved.
p292
aVWhy would you do that?
p293
aVBecause I know we need to bring the wheel farther into the aerodynamics.
p294
aVSo it's more expensive, but it's wonderful.
p295
aVAnd to cap it all,
p296
aVbrand royalty \u2014
p297
aVAgusta, Count Agusta,
p298
aVfrom the great histories of this stuff.
p299
aa(lp300
VThe bit that you can't see is the genius that created this.
p301
aVMassimo Tamburini.
p302
aVThey call him "The Plumber" in Italy,
p303
aVas well as "Maestro,"
p304
aVbecause he actually is engineer
p305
aVand craftsman and sculptor at the same time.
p306
aVThere's so little compromise on this, you can't see it.
p307
aa(lp308
VBut unfortunately, the likes of me and people that are like me
p309
aVhave to deal with compromise all the time with beauty.
p310
aVWe have to deal with it.
p311
aVSo I have to work with a supply chain, and I've got to work with the technologies,
p312
aVand I've got to work with everything else all the time,
p313
aVand so compromises start to fit into it.
p314
aVAnd so look at her.
p315
aVI've had to make a bit of a compromise there.
p316
aVI've had to move that part across, but only a millimeter.
p317
aVNo one's noticed, have they yet?
p318
aVDid you see what I did?
p319
aVI moved three things by a millimeter.
p320
aVPretty? Yes.
p321
aVBeautiful? Maybe lesser.
p322
aVBut then, of course, the consumer says that doesn't really matter.
p323
aVSo that's okay, isn't it?
p324
aVAnother millimeter?
p325
aVNo one's going to notice those split lines and changes.
p326
aVIt's that easy to lose beauty,
p327
aVbecause beauty's incredibly difficult to do.
p328
aVAnd only a few people can do it.
p329
aVAnd a focus group cannot do it.
p330
aVAnd a team rarely can do it.
p331
aVIt takes a central cortex, if you like,
p332
aVto be able to orchestrate all those elements at the same time.
p333
aa(lp334
VThis is a beautiful water bottle \u2014
p335
aVsome of you know of it \u2014
p336
aVdone by Ross Lovegrove, the designer.
p337
aVThis is pretty close to intrinsic beauty. This one,
p338
aVas long as you know what water is like
p339
aVthen you can experience this.
p340
aVIt's lovely because it is an embodiment
p341
aVof something refreshing and delicious.
p342
aVI might like it more than you like it,
p343
aVbecause I know how bloody hard it is to do it.
p344
aVIt's stupefyingly difficult
p345
aVto make something that refracts light like that,
p346
aVthat comes out of the tool correctly,
p347
aVthat goes down the line without falling over.
p348
aVUnderneath this, like the story of the swan,
p349
aVis a million things very difficult to do.
p350
aVSo all hail to that.
p351
aVIt's a fantastic example, a simple object.
p352
aVAnd the one I showed you before was, of course, a massively complex one.
p353
aVAnd they're working in beauty
p354
aVin slightly different ways because of it.
p355
aa(lp356
VYou all, I guess, like me,
p357
aVenjoy watching a ballet dancer dance.
p358
aVAnd part of the joy of it is, you know the difficulty.
p359
aVYou also may be taking into account the fact that it's incredibly painful.
p360
aVAnybody seen a ballet dancer's toes
p361
aVwhen they come out of the points?
p362
aVWhile she's doing these graceful arabesques and plies and what have you,
p363
aVsomething horrible's going on down here.
p364
aVThe comprehension of it
p365
aVleads us to a greater and heightened sense
p366
aVof the beauty of what's actually going on.
p367
aa(lp368
VNow I'm using microseconds wrongly here,
p369
aVso please ignore me.
p370
aVBut what I have to do now, feeling again,
p371
aVwhat I've got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes,
p372
aVof these triggers into something early on in the process,
p373
aVthat you pick it up,
p374
aVnot through your thinking, but through your feeling.
p375
aVSo we're going to have a little experiment.
p376
aVRight, are you ready? I'm going to show you something for a very, very brief moment.
p377
aVAre you ready? Okay.
p378
aVDid you think that was a bicycle when I showed it to you at the first flash?
p379
aVIt's not.
p380
aVTell me something, did you think it was quick when you first saw it? Yes you did.
p381
aVDid you think it was modern? Yes you did.
p382
aVThat blip, that information, shot into you before that.
p383
aVAnd because your brain starter motor began there,
p384
aVnow it's got to deal with it.
p385
aVAnd the great thing is, this motorcycle has been styled this way
p386
aVspecifically to engender a sense
p387
aVthat it's green technology and it's good for you
p388
aVand it's light and it's all part of the future.
p389
aa(lp390
VSo is that wrong?
p391
aVWell in this case it isn't,
p392
aVbecause it's a very, very ecologically-sound piece of technology.
p393
aVBut you're a slave of that first flash.
p394
aVWe are slaves to the first few fractions of a second \u2014
p395
aVand that's where much of my work
p396
aVhas to win or lose,
p397
aVon a shelf in a shop.
p398
aVIt wins or loses at that point.
p399
aVYou may see 50, 100, 200 things on a shelf
p400
aVas you walk down it,
p401
aVbut I have to work within that domain,
p402
aVto ensure that it gets you there first.
p403
aa(lp404
VAnd finally, the layer that I love, of knowledge.
p405
aVSome of you, I'm sure, will be familiar with this.
p406
aVWhat's incredible about this,
p407
aVand the way I love to come back to it,
p408
aVis this is taking something that you hate or bores you,
p409
aVfolding clothes,
p410
aVand if you can actually do this \u2014
p411
aVwho can actually do this? Anybody try to do this?
p412
aVYeah?
p413
aVIt's fantastic, isn't it?
p414
aVLook at that. Do you want to see it again?
p415
aVNo time. It says I have two minutes left, so we can't do this.
p416
aVBut just go to the Web, YouTube,
p417
aVpull it down, "folding T-shirt."
p418
aVThat's how underpaid younger-aged people have to fold your T-shirt.
p419
aVYou didn't maybe know it.
p420
aVBut how do you feel about it?
p421
aVIt feels fantastic when you do it, you look forward to doing it,
p422
aVand when you tell somebody else about it \u2014 like you probably have \u2014
p423
aVyou look really smart.
p424
aVThe knowledge bubble that sits around the outside,
p425
aVthe stuff that costs nothing,
p426
aVbecause that knowledge is free \u2014
p427
aVbundle that together and where do we come out?
p428
aa(lp429
VForm follows function?
p430
aVOnly sometimes. Only sometimes.
p431
aVForm is function. Form is function.
p432
aVIt informs, it tells us,
p433
aVit supplies us answers before we've even thought about it.
p434
aVAnd so I've stopped using words like "form,"
p435
aVand I've stopped using words like "function" as a designer.
p436
aVWhat I try to pursue now
