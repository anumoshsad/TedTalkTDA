VI spent the best part of last year
p4
aVworking on a documentary
p5
aVabout my own happiness \u2014
p6
aVtrying to see
p7
aVif I can actually train my mind
p8
aVin a particular way,
p9
aVlike I can train my body,
p10
aVso I can end up with an improved feeling
p11
aVof overall well-being.
p12
aVThen this January,
p13
aVmy mother died,
p14
aVand pursuing a film like that
p15
aVjust seemed the last thing that was interesting to me.
p16
aVSo in a very typical, silly designer fashion,
p17
aVafter years worth of work,
p18
aVpretty much all I have to show for it are the titles for the film.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Music)
p21
aa(lp22
VThey were still done
p23
aVwhen I was on sabbatical with my company in Indonesia.
p24
aVWe can see the first part here was designed here by pigs.
p25
aVIt was a little bit too funky,
p26
aVand we wanted a more feminine point of view
p27
aVand employed a duck
p28
aVwho did it in a much more fitting way \u2014
p29
aVfashion.
p30
aVMy studio in Bali
p31
aVwas only 10 minutes away from a monkey forest,
p32
aVand monkeys, of course,
p33
aVare supposed to be the happiest of all animals.
p34
aVSo we trained them to be able to do three separate words,
p35
aVto lay out them properly.
p36
aVYou can see,
p37
aVthere still is a little bit of a legibility problem there.
p38
aVThe serif is not really in place.
p39
aVSo of course, what you don't do properly yourself
p40
aVis never deemed done really.
p41
aVSo this is us climbing onto the trees
p42
aVand putting it up over the Sayan Valley
p43
aVin Indonesia.
p44
aa(lp45
VIn that year, what I did do a lot
p46
aVwas look at all sorts of surveys,
p47
aVlooking at a lot of data on this subject.
p48
aVAnd it turns out
p49
aVthat men and women
p50
aVreport very, very similar levels of happiness.
p51
aVThis is a very quick overview
p52
aVof all the studies that I looked at.
p53
aVThat climate plays no role.
p54
aVThat if you live in the best climate,
p55
aVin San Diego in the United States,
p56
aVor in the shittiest climate, in Buffalo, New York,
p57
aVyou are going to be just as happy
p58
aVin either place.
p59
aVIf you make more than 50,000 bucks a year in the U.S.,
p60
aVany salary increase you're going to experience
p61
aVwill have only a tiny, tiny influence
p62
aVon your overall well-being.
p63
aVBlack people are just as happy as white people are.
p64
aVIf you're old or young
p65
aVit doesn't really make a difference.
p66
aVIf you're ugly or if you're really, really good-looking
p67
aVit makes no difference whatsoever.
p68
aVYou will adapt to it and get used to it.
p69
aVIf you have manageable health problems
p70
aVit doesn't really matter.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow this does matter.
p73
aVSo now the woman on the right
p74
aVis actually much happier than the guy on the left \u2014
p75
aVmeaning that, if you have a lot of friends,
p76
aVand you have meaningful friendships,
p77
aVthat does make a lot of difference.
p78
aVAs well as being married \u2014 you are likely to be much happier
p79
aVthan if you are single.
p80
aa(lp81
VA fellow TED speaker, Jonathan Haidt,
p82
aVcame up with this beautiful little analogy
p83
aVbetween the conscious and the unconscious mind.
p84
aVHe says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider
p85
aVon this giant elephant, the unconscious.
p86
aVAnd the rider thinks
p87
aVthat he can tell the elephant what to do,
p88
aVbut the elephant really has his own ideas.
p89
aVIf I look at my own life,
p90
aVI'm born in 1962 in Austria.
p91
aVIf I would have been born a hundred years earlier,
p92
aVthe big decisions in my life would have been made for me \u2014
p93
aVmeaning I would have stayed in the town that I was born in;
p94
aVI would have very much likely
p95
aVentered the same profession that my dad did;
p96
aVand I would have very much likely married a woman
p97
aVthat my mom had selected.
p98
aVI, of course, and all of us,
p99
aVare very much in charge
p100
aVof these big decisions in our lives.
p101
aVWe live where we want to be \u2014
p102
aVat least in the West.
p103
aVWe become what we really are interested in.
p104
aVWe choose our own profession,
p105
aVand we choose our own partners.
p106
aVAnd so it's quite surprising
p107
aVthat many of us
p108
aVlet our unconscious influence those decisions
p109
aVin ways that we are not quite aware of.
p110
aa(lp111
VIf you look at the statistics
p112
aVand you see that the guy called George,
p113
aVwhen he decides on where he wants to live \u2014
p114
aVis it Florida or North Dakota? \u2014
p115
aVhe goes and lives in Georgia.
p116
aVAnd if you look at a guy called Dennis,
p117
aVwhen he decides what to become \u2014
p118
aVis it a lawyer, or does he want to become a doctor
p119
aVor a teacher? \u2014
p120
aVbest chance is that he wants to become a dentist.
p121
aVAnd if Paula decides
p122
aVshould she marry Joe or Jack,
p123
aVsomehow Paul sounds the most interesting.
p124
aVAnd so even if we make
p125
aVthose very important decisions
p126
aVfor very silly reasons,
p127
aVit remains statistically true
p128
aVthat there are more Georges living in Georgia
p129
aVand there are more Dennises becoming dentists
p130
aVand there are more Paulas who are married to Paul
p131
aVthan statistically viable.
p132
aV(Laughter)
p133
aVNow I, of course, thought,
p134
aV"Well this is American data,"
p135
aVand I thought, "Well, those silly Americans.
p136
aVThey get influenced by things
p137
aVthat they're not aware of.
p138
aVThis is just completely ridiculous."
p139
aVThen, of course, I looked at my mom and my dad \u2014
p140
aV(Laughter)
p141
aVKarolina and Karl,
p142
aVand grandmom and granddad,
p143
aVJosefine and Josef.
p144
aVSo I am looking still for a Stephanie.
p145
aVI'll figure something out.
p146
aa(lp147
VIf I make this whole thing a little bit more personal
p148
aVand see what makes me happy as a designer,
p149
aVthe easiest answer, of course,
p150
aVis do more of the stuff that I like to do
p151
aVand much less of the stuff that I don't like to do \u2014
p152
aVfor which it would be helpful
p153
aVto know what it is that I actually do like to do.
p154
aVI'm a big list maker,
p155
aVso I came up with a list.
p156
aVOne of them is to think without pressure.
p157
aVThis is a project we're working on right now
p158
aVwith a very healthy deadline.
p159
aVIt's a book on culture,
p160
aVand, as you can see,
p161
aVculture is rapidly drifting around.
p162
aVDoing things like I'm doing right now \u2014
p163
aVtraveling to Cannes.
p164
aVThe example I have here
p165
aVis a chair that came out of the year in Bali \u2014
p166
aVclearly influenced by local manufacturing and culture,
p167
aVnot being stuck behind
p168
aVa single computer screen all day long
p169
aVand be here and there.
p170
aVQuite consciously, design projects
p171
aVthat need an incredible amount of various techniques,
p172
aVjust basically to fight
p173
aVstraightforward adaptation.
p174
aa(lp175
VBeing close to the content \u2014
p176
aVthat's the content really is close to my heart.
p177
aVThis is a bus, or vehicle,
p178
aVfor a charity, for an NGO
p179
aVthat wants to double the education budget in the United States \u2014
p180
aVcarefully designed,
p181
aVso, by two inches, it still clears highway overpasses.
p182
aVHaving end results \u2014 things that come back from the printer well,
p183
aVlike this little business card for an animation company
p184
aVcalled Sideshow
p185
aVon lenticular foils.
p186
aVWorking on projects
p187
aVthat actually have visible impacts,
p188
aVlike a book for a deceased German artist
p189
aVwhose widow came to us
p190
aVwith the requirement to make her late husband famous.
p191
aVIt just came out six months ago,
p192
aVand it's getting unbelievable traction right now in Germany.
p193
aVAnd I think that his widow
p194
aVis going to be very successful on her quest.
p195
aa(lp196
VAnd lately, to be involved in projects
p197
aVwhere I know about 50 percent of the project
p198
aVtechnique-wise
p199
aVand the other 50 percent would be new.
p200
aVSo in this case,
p201
aVit's an outside projection for Singapore
p202
aVon these giant Times Square-like screens.
p203
aVAnd I of course knew stuff, as a designer,
p204
aVabout typography,
p205
aVeven though we worked with those animals not so successfully.
p206
aVBut I didn't quite know
p207
aVall that much about movement or film.
p208
aVAnd from that point of view we turned it into a lovely project.
p209
aVBut also because the content was very close.
p210
aVIn this case, "Keeping a Diary
p211
aVSupports Personal Development" \u2014
p212
aVI've been keeping a diary since I was 12.
p213
aVAnd I've found that it influenced my life and work
p214
aVin a very intriguing way.
p215
aVIn this case also because
p216
aVit's part of one of the many sentiments
p217
aVthat we build the whole series on \u2014
p218
aVthat all the sentiments originally had come out of the diary.
p219
aa(lp220
