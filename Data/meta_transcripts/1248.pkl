VI'd like to take you to another world.
p4
aVAnd I'd like to share
p5
aVa 45 year-old love story
p6
aVwith the poor,
p7
aVliving on less than one dollar a day.
p8
aVI went to a very elitist, snobbish,
p9
aVexpensive education in India,
p10
aVand that almost destroyed me.
p11
aVI was all set
p12
aVto be a diplomat, teacher, doctor \u2014
p13
aVall laid out.
p14
aVThen, I don't look it, but I was the Indian national squash champion
p15
aVfor three years.
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aVThe whole world was laid out for me.
p18
aVEverything was at my feet.
p19
aVI could do nothing wrong.
p20
aVAnd then I thought out of curiosity
p21
aVI'd like to go and live and work
p22
aVand just see what a village is like.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo in 1965,
p25
aVI went to what was called the worst Bihar famine in India,
p26
aVand I saw starvation, death,
p27
aVpeople dying of hunger, for the first time.
p28
aVIt changed my life.
p29
aVI came back home,
p30
aVtold my mother,
p31
aV"I'd like to live and work in a village."
p32
aVMother went into a coma.
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aV"What is this?
p35
aVThe whole world is laid out for you, the best jobs are laid out for you,
p36
aVand you want to go and work in a village?
p37
aVI mean, is there something wrong with you?"
p38
aVI said, "No, I've got the best eduction.
p39
aVIt made me think.
p40
aVAnd I wanted to give something back
p41
aVin my own way."
p42
aV"What do you want to do in a village?
p43
aVNo job, no money,
p44
aVno security, no prospect."
p45
aVI said, "I want to live
p46
aVand dig wells for five years."
p47
aV"Dig wells for five years?
p48
aVYou went to the most expensive school and college in India,
p49
aVand you want to dig wells for five years?"
p50
aVShe didn't speak to me for a very long time,
p51
aVbecause she thought I'd let my family down.
p52
aa(lp53
VBut then,
p54
aVI was exposed to the most extraordinary knowledge and skills
p55
aVthat very poor people have,
p56
aVwhich are never brought into the mainstream \u2014
p57
aVwhich is never identified, respected,
p58
aVapplied on a large scale.
p59
aVAnd I thought I'd start a Barefoot College \u2014
p60
aVcollege only for the poor.
p61
aVWhat the poor thought was important
p62
aVwould be reflected in the college.
p63
aVI went to this village for the first time.
p64
aVElders came to me
p65
aVand said, "Are you running from the police?"
p66
aVI said, "No."
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aV"You failed in your exam?"
p69
aVI said, "No."
p70
aV"You didn't get a government job?" I said, "No."
p71
aV"What are you doing here?
p72
aVWhy are you here?
p73
aVThe education system in India
p74
aVmakes you look at Paris and New Delhi and Zurich;
p75
aVwhat are you doing in this village?
p76
aVIs there something wrong with you you're not telling us?"
p77
aVI said, "No, I want to actually start a college
p78
aVonly for the poor.
p79
aVWhat the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college."
p80
aa(lp81
VSo the elders gave me some very sound and profound advice.
p82
aVThey said, "Please,
p83
aVdon't bring anyone with a degree and qualification
p84
aVinto your college."
p85
aVSo it's the only college in India
p86
aVwhere, if you should have a Ph.D. or a Master's,
p87
aVyou are disqualified to come.
p88
aVYou have to be a cop-out or a wash-out or a dropout
p89
aVto come to our college.
p90
aVYou have to work with your hands.
p91
aVYou have to have a dignity of labor.
p92
aVYou have to show that you have a skill that you can offer to the community
p93
aVand provide a service to the community.
p94
aVSo we started the Barefoot College,
p95
aVand we redefined professionalism.
p96
aa(lp97
VWho is a professional?
p98
aVA professional is someone
p99
aVwho has a combination of competence,
p100
aVconfidence and belief.
p101
aVA water diviner is a professional.
p102
aVA traditional midwife
p103
aVis a professional.
p104
aVA traditional bone setter is a professional.
p105
aVThese are professionals all over the world.
p106
aVYou find them in any inaccessible village around the world.
p107
aVAnd we thought that these people should come into the mainstream
p108
aVand show that the knowledge and skills that they have
p109
aVis universal.
p110
aVIt needs to be used, needs to be applied,
p111
aVneeds to be shown to the world outside \u2014
p112
aVthat these knowledge and skills
p113
aVare relevant even today.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo the college works
p116
aVfollowing the lifestyle and workstyle of Mahatma Gandhi.
p117
aVYou eat on the floor, you sleep on the floor, you work on the floor.
p118
aVThere are no contracts, no written contracts.
p119
aVYou can stay with me for 20 years, go tomorrow.
p120
aVAnd no one can get more than $100 a month.
p121
aVYou come for the money, you don't come to Barefoot College.
p122
aVYou come for the work and the challenge,
p123
aVyou'll come to the Barefoot College.
p124
aVThat is where we want you to try crazy ideas.
p125
aVWhatever idea you have, come and try it.
p126
aVIt doesn't matter if you fail.
p127
aVBattered, bruised, you start again.
p128
aVIt's the only college where the teacher is the learner
p129
aVand the learner is the teacher.
p130
aVAnd it's the only college where we don't give a certificate.
p131
aVYou are certified by the community you serve.
p132
aVYou don't need a paper to hang on the wall
p133
aVto show that you are an engineer.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo when I said that,
p136
aVthey said, "Well show us what is possible. What are you doing?
p137
aVThis is all mumbo-jumbo if you can't show it on the ground."
p138
aVSo we built the first Barefoot College
p139
aVin 1986.
p140
aVIt was built by 12 Barefoot architects
p141
aVwho can't read and write,
p142
aVbuilt on $1.50 a sq. ft.
p143
aV150 people lived there, worked there.
p144
aVThey got the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2002.
p145
aVBut then they suspected, they thought there was an architect behind it.
p146
aVI said, "Yes, they made the blueprints,
p147
aVbut the Barefoot architects actually constructed the college."
p148
aVWe are the only ones who actually returned the award for $50,000,
p149
aVbecause they didn't believe us,
p150
aVand we thought that they were actually casting aspersions
p151
aVon the Barefoot architects of Tilonia.
p152
aa(lp153
VI asked a forester \u2014
p154
aVhigh-powered, paper-qualified expert \u2014
p155
aVI said, "What can you build in this place?"
p156
aVHe had one look at the soil and said, "Forget it. No way.
p157
aVNot even worth it.
p158
aVNo water, rocky soil."
p159
aVI was in a bit of a spot.
p160
aVAnd I said, "Okay, I'll go to the old man in village
p161
aVand say, 'What should I grow in this spot?'"
p162
aVHe looked quietly at me and said,
p163
aV"You build this, you build this, you put this, and it'll work."
p164
aVThis is what it looks like today.
p165
aa(lp166
VWent to the roof,
p167
aVand all the women said, "Clear out.
p168
aVThe men should clear out because we don't want to share this technology with the men.
p169
aVThis is waterproofing the roof."
p170
aV(Laughter)
p171
aVIt is a bit of jaggery, a bit of urens
p172
aVand a bit of other things I don't know.
p173
aVBut it actually doesn't leak.
p174
aVSince 1986, it hasn't leaked.
p175
aVThis technology, the women will not share with the men.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VIt's the only college
p180
aVwhich is fully solar-electrified.
p181
aVAll the power comes from the sun.
p182
aV45 kilowatts of panels on the roof.
p183
aVAnd everything works off the sun for the next 25 years.
p184
aVSo long as the sun shines,
p185
aVwe'll have no problem with power.
p186
aVBut the beauty is
p187
aVthat is was installed
p188
aVby a priest, a Hindu priest,
p189
aVwho's only done eight years of primary schooling \u2014
p190
aVnever been to school, never been to college.
p191
aVHe knows more about solar
p192
aVthan anyone I know anywhere in the world guaranteed.
p193
aa(lp194
VFood, if you come to the Barefoot College,
p195
aVis solar cooked.
p196
aVBut the people who fabricated that solar cooker
p197
aVare women,
p198
aVilliterate women,
p199
aVwho actually fabricate
p200
aVthe most sophisticated solar cooker.
p201
aVIt's a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker.
p202
aVUnfortunately, they're almost half German,
p203
aVthey're so precise.
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aVYou'll never find Indian women so precise.
p206
aVAbsolutely to the last inch,
p207
aVthey can make that cooker.
p208
aVAnd we have 60 meals twice a day
p209
aVof solar cooking.
p210
aa(lp211
VWe have a dentist \u2014
p212
aVshe's a grandmother, illiterate, who's a dentist.
p213
aVShe actually looks after the teeth
p214
aVof 7,000 children.
p215
aVBarefoot technology:
p216
aVthis was 1986 \u2014 no engineer, no architect thought of it \u2014
p217
aVbut we are collecting rainwater from the roofs.
p218
aVVery little water is wasted.
p219
aVAll the roofs are connected underground
p220
aVto a 400,000 liter tank,
p221
aVand no water is wasted.
p222
aVIf we have four years of drought, we still have water on the campus,
p223
aVbecause we collect rainwater.
p224
aa(lp225
V60 percent of children don't go to school,
p226
aVbecause they have to look after animals \u2014
p227
aVsheep, goats \u2014
p228
aVdomestic chores.
p229
aVSo we thought of starting a school
p230
aVat night for the children.
p231
aVBecause the night schools of Tilonia,
p232
aVover 75,000 children have gone through these night schools.
p233
aVBecause it's for the convenience of the child;
p234
aVit's not for the convenience of the teacher.
p235
aVAnd what do we teach in these schools?
p236
aVDemocracy, citizenship,
p237
aVhow you should measure your land,
p238
aVwhat you should do if you're arrested,
p239
aVwhat you should do if your animal is sick.
p240
aVThis is what we teach in the night schools.
p241
aVBut all the schools are solar-lit.
p242
aa(lp243
VEvery five years
p244
aVwe have an election.
p245
aVBetween six to 14 year-old children
p246
aVparticipate in a democratic process,
p247
aVand they elect a prime minister.
p248
aVThe prime minister is 12 years old.
p249
aVShe looks after 20 goats in the morning,
p250
aVbut she's prime minister in the evening.
p251
aVShe has a cabinet,
p252
aVa minister of education, a minister for energy, a minister for health.
p253
aVAnd they actually monitor and supervise
p254
aV150 schools for 7,000 children.
p255
aVShe got the World's Children's Prize five years ago,
p256
aVand she went to Sweden.
p257
aVFirst time ever going out of her village.
p258
aVNever seen Sweden.
p259
aVWasn't dazzled at all by what was happening.
p260
aVAnd the Queen of Sweden, who's there,
p261
aVturned to me and said, "Can you ask this child where she got her confidence from?
p262
aVShe's only 12 years old,
p263
aVand she's not dazzled by anything."
p264
aVAnd the girl, who's on her left,
p265
aVturned to me and looked at the queen straight in the eye
p266
aVand said, "Please tell her I'm the prime minister."
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
V(Applause)
p271
aa(lp272
VWhere the percentage of illiteracy is very high,
p273
aVwe use puppetry.
p274
aVPuppets is the way we communicate.
p275
aVYou have Jokhim Chacha
p276
aVwho is 300 years old.
p277
aVHe is my psychoanalyst. He is my teacher.
p278
aVHe's my doctor. He's my lawyer.
p279
aVHe's my donor.
p280
aVHe actually raises money,
p281
aVsolves my disputes.
p282
aVHe solves my problems in the village.
p283
aVIf there's tension in the village,
p284
aVif attendance at the schools goes down
p285
aVand there's a friction between the teacher and the parent,
p286
aVthe puppet calls the teacher and the parent in front of the whole village
p287
aVand says, "Shake hands.
p288
aVThe attendance must not drop."
p289
aVThese puppets
p290
aVare made out of recycled World Bank reports.
p291
aa(lp292
V(Laughter)
p293
aa(lp294
V(Applause)
p295
aa(lp296
VSo this decentralized, demystified approach
p297
aVof solar-electrifying villages,
p298
aVwe've covered all over India
p299
aVfrom Ladakh up to Bhutan \u2014
p300
aVall solar-electrified villages
p301
aVby people who have been trained.
p302
aVAnd we went to Ladakh,
p303
aVand we asked this woman \u2014
p304
aVthis, at minus 40, you have to come out of the roof,
p305
aVbecause there's no place, it was all snowed up on both sides \u2014
p306
aVand we asked this woman,
p307
aV"What was the benefit you had
p308
aVfrom solar electricity?"
p309
aVAnd she thought for a minute and said,
p310
aV"It's the first time I can see my husband's face in winter."
p311
aa(lp312
V(Laughter)
p313
aa(lp314
VWent to Afghanistan.
p315
aVOne lesson we learned in India
p316
aVwas men are untrainable.
p317
aV(Laughter)
p318
aVMen are restless,
p319
aVmen are ambitious,
p320
aVmen are compulsively mobile,
p321
aVand they all want a certificate.
p322
aV(Laughter)
p323
aVAll across the globe, you have this tendency
p324
aVof men wanting a certificate.
p325
aVWhy? Because they want to leave the village
p326
aVand go to a city, looking for a job.
p327
aVSo we came up with a great solution:
p328
aVtrain grandmothers.
p329
aVWhat's the best way of communicating
p330
aVin the world today?
p331
aVTelevision? No.
p332
aVTelegraph? No.
p333
aVTelephone? No.
p334
aVTell a woman.
p335
aa(lp336
V(Laughter)
p337
aa(lp338
V(Applause)
p339
aa(lp340
VSo we went to Afghanistan for the first time,
p341
aVand we picked three women
p342
aVand said, "We want to take them to India."
p343
aVThey said, "Impossible. They don't even go out of their rooms,
p344
aVand you want to take them to India."
p345
aVI said, "I'll make a concession. I'll take the husbands along as well."
p346
aVSo I took the husbands along.
p347
aVOf course, the women were much more intelligent than the men.
p348
aVIn six months,
p349
aVhow do we train these women?
p350
aVSign language.
p351
aVYou don't choose the written word.
p352
aVYou don't choose the spoken word.
p353
aVYou use sign language.
p354
aVAnd in six months
p355
aVthey can become solar engineers.
p356
aVThey go back and solar-electrify their own village.
p357
aa(lp358
VThis woman went back
p359
aVand solar-electrified the first village,
p360
aVset up a workshop \u2014
p361
aVthe first village ever to be solar-electrified in Afghanistan
p362
aV[was] by the three women.
p363
aVThis woman
p364
aVis an extraordinary grandmother.
p365
aV55 years old, and she's solar-electrified 200 houses for me in Afghanistan.
p366
aVAnd they haven't collapsed.
p367
aVShe actually went and spoke to an engineering department in Afghanistan
p368
aVand told the head of the department
p369
aVthe difference between AC and DC.
p370
aVHe didn't know.
p371
aVThose three women have trained 27 more women
p372
aVand solar-electrified 100 villages in Afghanistan.
p373
aa(lp374
VWe went to Africa,
p375
aVand we did the same thing.
p376
aVAll these women sitting at one table from eight, nine countries,
p377
aVall chatting to each other, not understanding a word,
p378
aVbecause they're all speaking a different language.
p379
aVBut their body language is great.
p380
aVThey're speaking to each other
p381
aVand actually becoming solar engineers.
p382
aVI went to Sierra Leone,
p383
aVand there was this minister driving down in the dead of night \u2014
p384
aVcomes across this village.
p385
aVComes back, goes into the village, says, "Well what's the story?"
p386
aVThey said, "These two grandmothers ... "
p387
aV"Grandmothers?" The minister couldn't believe what was happening.
p388
aV"Where did they go?" "Went to India and back."
p389
aVWent straight to the president.
p390
aVHe said, "Do you know there's a solar-electrified village in Sierra Leone?"
p391
aVHe said, "No." Half the cabinet went to see the grandmothers the next day.
p392
aV"What's the story."
p393
aVSo he summoned me and said, "Can you train me 150 grandmothers?"
p394
aVI said, "I can't, Mr. President.
p395
aVBut they will. The grandmothers will."
p396
aVSo he built me the first Barefoot training center in Sierra Leone.
p397
aVAnd 150 grandmothers have been trained in Sierra Leone.
p398
aa(lp399
VGambia:
p400
aVwe went to select a grandmother in Gambia.
p401
aVWent to this village.
p402
aVI knew which woman I would like to take.
p403
aVThe community got together and said, "Take these two women."
p404
aVI said, "No, I want to take this woman."
p405
aVThey said, "Why? She doesn't know the language. You don't know her."
p406
aVI said, "I like the body language. I like the way she speaks."
p407
aV"Difficult husband; not possible."
p408
aVCalled the husband, the husband came,
p409
aVswaggering, politician, mobile in his hand. "Not possible."
p410
aV"Why not?" "The woman, look how beautiful she is."
p411
aVI said, "Yeah, she is very beautiful."
p412
aV"What happens if she runs off with an Indian man?"
p413
aVThat was his biggest fear.
p414
aVI said, "She'll be happy. She'll ring you up on the mobile."
p415
aVShe went like a grandmother
p416
aVand came back like a tiger.
p417
aVShe walked out of the plane
p418
aVand spoke to the whole press as if she was a veteran.
p419
aVShe handled the national press,
p420
aVand she was a star.
p421
aVAnd when I went back six months later, I said, "Where's your husband?"
p422
aV"Oh, somewhere. It doesn't matter."
p423
aV(Laughter)
p424
aVSuccess story.
p425
aa(lp426
V(Laughter)
p427
aa(lp428
V(Applause)
p429
aa(lp430
VI'll just wind up by saying
p431
aVthat I think you don't have to look for solutions outside.
p432
aVLook for solutions within.
p433
aVAnd listen to people. They have the solutions in front of you.
p434
aVThey're all over the world.
p435
aVDon't even worry.
p436
aVDon't listen to the World Bank, listen to the people on the ground.
p437
aVThey have all the solutions in the world.
p438
aa(lp439
VI'll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi.
p440
aV"First they ignore you,
p441
aVthen they laugh at you,
p442
aVthen they fight you,
p443
aVand then you win."
p444
