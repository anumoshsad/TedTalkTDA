VLife is about opportunities \u2014 creating them and embracing them.
p4
aVAnd for me, that was the Olympic dream.
p5
aVThat's what defined me. That was my bliss.
p6
aa(lp7
VAs a cross-country skier and member of the Australian ski team
p8
aVheaded towards the Winter Olympics,
p9
aVI was on a training bike ride with my fellow teammates.
p10
aVAs we made our way up towards the spectacular Blue Mountains
p11
aVwest of Sydney,
p12
aVit was the perfect autumn day:
p13
aVsunshine, the smell of eucalypt and a dream.
p14
aVLife was good.
p15
aVWe'd been on our bikes for around five-and-a-half hours
p16
aVwhen we got to the part of the ride that I loved,
p17
aVand that was the hills, because I loved the hills.
p18
aVI got up off the seat of my bike and I started pumping my legs,
p19
aVand as I sucked in the cold mountain air, I could feel it burning my lungs,
p20
aVand I looked up to see the sun shining in my face.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd then everything went black.
p23
aVWhere was I? What was happening?
p24
aVMy body was consumed by pain.
p25
aVI'd been hit by a speeding utility truck
p26
aVwith only 10 minutes to go on the bike ride.
p27
aVI was airlifted from the scene of the accident by a rescue helicopter
p28
aVto a large spinal unit in Sydney.
p29
aVI had extensive and life-threatening injuries.
p30
aVI'd broken my neck and my back in six places.
p31
aVI broke five ribs on my left side.
p32
aVI broke my right arm. I broke my collarbone.
p33
aVI broke some bones in my feet.
p34
aVMy whole right side was ripped open, filled with gravel.
p35
aVMy head was cut open across the front, lifted back,
p36
aVexposing the skull underneath.
p37
aVI had head injures. I had internal injuries.
p38
aVI had massive blood loss.
p39
aVIn fact, I lost about five liters of blood,
p40
aVwhich is all someone my size would actually hold.
p41
aVBy the time the helicopter arrived at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney,
p42
aVmy blood pressure was 40 over nothing.
p43
aVI was having a really bad day.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VFor over 10 days, I drifted between two dimensions.
p48
aVI had an awareness of being in my body,
p49
aVbut also being out of my body, somewhere else,
p50
aVwatching from above, as if it was happening to someone else.
p51
aVWhy would I want to go back to a body that was so broken?
p52
aa(lp53
VBut this voice kept calling me:
p54
aV"Come on, stay with me."
p55
aa(lp56
V"No, it's too hard."
p57
aa(lp58
V"Come on. This is our opportunity."
p59
aa(lp60
V"No. That body is broken. It can no longer serve me."
p61
aa(lp62
V"Come on. Stay with me. We can do it. We can do it together."
p63
aa(lp64
VI was at a crossroads.
p65
aVI knew if I didn't return to my body, I'd have to leave this world forever.
p66
aVIt was the fight of my life.
p67
aVAfter 10 days, I made the decision to return to my body.
p68
aVAnd the internal bleeding stopped.
p69
aa(lp70
VThe next concern was whether I would walk again,
p71
aVbecause I was paralyzed from the waist down.
p72
aVThey said to my parents that the neck break was a stable fracture,
p73
aVbut the back was completely crushed:
p74
aVthe vertebra at L1 was like you'd dropped a peanut,
p75
aVstepped on it, smashed it into thousands of pieces.
p76
aVThey'd have to operate.
p77
aVThey went in. They put me on a beanbag.
p78
aVThey cut me \u2014 literally cut me in half.
p79
aVI have a scar that wraps around my entire body.
p80
aVThey picked as much broken bone as they could
p81
aVthat had lodged in my spinal cord.
p82
aVThey took out two of my broken ribs and they rebuilt my back \u2014
p83
aVL1, they rebuilt it, they took out another broken rib,
p84
aVthey fused T12, L1 and L2 together.
p85
aVThen they stitched me up; they took an entire hour to stitch me up.
p86
aVI woke up in intensive care,
p87
aVand the doctors were really excited that the operation had been a success,
p88
aVbecause at that stage, I had a little bit of movement
p89
aVin one of my big toes,
p90
aVand I thought, "Great, because I'm going to the Olympics!"
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VI had no idea.
p95
aVThat's the sort of thing that happens to someone else, not me, surely.
p96
aa(lp97
VBut then the doctor came over to me and she said,
p98
aV"Janine, the operation was a success,
p99
aVand we've picked as much bone out of your spinal cord as we could.
p100
aVBut the damage is permanent.
p101
aVThe central nervous system nerves \u2014 there is no cure.
p102
aVYou're what we call a partial paraplegic,
p103
aVand you'll have all of the injuries that go along with that.
p104
aVYou'll have no feeling from the waist down,
p105
aVand at most, you might get 10 or 20 percent return.
p106
aVYou'll have internal injuries for the rest of your life.
p107
aVYou'll have to use a catheter for the rest of your life.
p108
aVAnd if you walk again, it will be with calipers and a walking frame."
p109
aVAnd then she said,
p110
aV"Janine, you'll have to rethink everything you do in your life,
p111
aVbecause you're never going to be able to do the things you did before."
p112
aa(lp113
V(Gasps)
p114
aa(lp115
VI tried to grasp what she was saying.
p116
aVI was an athlete. That's all I knew. That's all I'd done.
p117
aVIf I couldn't do that, then what could I do?
p118
aVAnd the question I asked myself is:
p119
aVIf I couldn't do that,
p120
aVthen who was I?
p121
aa(lp122
VThey moved me from intensive care to acute spinal.
p123
aVI was lying on a thin, hard spinal bed.
p124
aVI had no movement in my legs.
p125
aVI had tight stockings on to protect from blood clots.
p126
aVI had one arm in plaster, one arm tied down by drips.
p127
aVI had a neck brace and sandbags on either side of my head
p128
aVand I saw my world through a mirror
p129
aVthat was suspended above my head.
p130
aVI shared the ward with five other people,
p131
aVand the amazing thing is,
p132
aVbecause we were all lying paralyzed in a spinal ward,
p133
aVwe didn't know what each other looked like.
p134
aVHow amazing is that?
p135
aVHow often in life do you get to make friendships, judgment-free,
p136
aVpurely based on spirit?
p137
aVAnd there were no superficial conversations
p138
aVas we shared our innermost thoughts, our fears,
p139
aVand our hopes for life after the spinal ward.
p140
aa(lp141
VI remember one night, one of the nurses came in, Jonathan,
p142
aVwith a whole lot of plastic straws.
p143
aVHe put a pile on top of each of us, and he said,
p144
aV"Start threading them together."
p145
aVWell, there wasn't much else to do in the spinal ward, so we did.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VAnd when we'd finished, he went around silently
p150
aVand he joined all of the straws up till it looped around the whole ward.
p151
aVAnd then he said,
p152
aV"OK everybody, hold on to your straws."
p153
aVAnd we did. And he said, "Right ...
p154
aVNow we're all connected."
p155
aVAnd as we held on and we breathed as one,
p156
aVwe knew we weren't on this journey alone.
p157
aVAnd even lying paralyzed in the spinal ward ...
p158
aVthere were moments of incredible depth and richness,
p159
aVof authenticity and connection
p160
aVthat I had never experienced before.
p161
aVAnd each of us knew that when we left the spinal ward,
p162
aVwe would never be the same.
p163
aa(lp164
VAfter six months, it was time to go home.
p165
aVI remember Dad pushing me outside in my wheelchair,
p166
aVwrapped in a plaster body cast,
p167
aVand feeling the sun on my face for the first time.
p168
aVI soaked it up and I thought,
p169
aV"How could I ever have taken this for granted?"
p170
aVI felt so incredibly grateful for my life.
p171
aVBut before I left hospital,
p172
aVthe head nurse had said to me, "Janine, I want you to be ready,
p173
aVbecause when you get home, something's going to happen."
p174
aVAnd I said, "What?"
p175
aVAnd she said, "You're going to get depressed."
p176
aVAnd I said, "Not me, not Janine the Machine,"
p177
aVwhich was my nickname.
p178
aVShe said, "You are, because, see, it happens to everyone.
p179
aVIn the spinal ward, that's normal. You're in a wheelchair. That's normal.
p180
aVBut you're going to get home and realize how different life is."
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd I got home.
p183
aVAnd something happened.
p184
aVI realized Sister Sam was right.
p185
aVI did get depressed.
p186
aVI was in my wheelchair.
p187
aVI had no feeling from the waist down,
p188
aVattached to a catheter bottle.
p189
aVI couldn't walk.
p190
aVI'd lost so much weight in hospital,
p191
aVI now weighed about 80 pounds.
p192
aVAnd I wanted to give up.
p193
aVAll I wanted to do was put my running shoes on and run out the door.
p194
aVI wanted my old life back. I wanted my body back.
p195
aa(lp196
VAnd I can remember Mom sitting on the end of my bed
p197
aVand saying, "I wonder if life will ever be good again."
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd I thought, "How could it?
p200
aVBecause I've lost everything that I valued,
p201
aVeverything that I'd worked towards.
p202
aVGone."
p203
aVAnd the question I asked was, "Why me? Why me?"
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd then I remembered
p206
aVmy friends that were still in the spinal ward,
p207
aVparticularly Maria.
p208
aVMaria was in a car accident,
p209
aVand she woke up on her 16th birthday
p210
aVto the news that she was a complete quadriplegic,
p211
aVhad no movement from the neck down,
p212
aVhad damage to her vocal chords, and she couldn't talk.
p213
aVThey told me, "We're going to move you next to her
p214
aVbecause we think it will be good for her."
p215
aVI was worried. I didn't know how I'd react to being next to her.
p216
aVI knew it would be challenging, but it was actually a blessing,
p217
aVbecause Maria always smiled.
p218
aVShe was always happy, and even when she began to talk again,
p219
aValbeit difficult to understand, she never complained, not once.
p220
aVAnd I wondered how had she ever found that level of acceptance.
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd I realized that this wasn't just my life;
p223
aVit was life itself.
p224
aVI realized that this wasn't just my pain; it was everybody's pain.
p225
aVAnd then I knew, just like before,
p226
aVthat I had a choice: I could keep fighting this,
p227
aVor I could let go and accept not only my body,
p228
aVbut the circumstances of my life.
p229
aVAnd then I stopped asking, "Why me?"
p230
aVAnd I started to ask, "Why not me?"
p231
aVAnd then I thought to myself,
p232
aVmaybe being at rock bottom is actually the perfect place to start.
p233
aa(lp234
VI had never before thought of myself as a creative person.
p235
aVI was an athlete; my body was a machine.
p236
aVBut now I was about to embark on the most creative project
p237
aVthat any of us could ever do:
p238
aVthat of rebuilding a life.
p239
aVAnd even though I had absolutely no idea what I was going to do,
p240
aVin that uncertainty came a sense of freedom.
p241
aVI was no longer tied to a set path.
p242
aVI was free to explore life's infinite possibilities.
p243
aVAnd that realization was about to change my life.
p244
aa(lp245
VSitting at home in my wheelchair and my plaster body cast,
p246
aVan airplane flew overhead.
p247
aVI looked up, and I thought to myself, "That's it!
p248
aVIf I can't walk, then I might as well fly."
p249
aa(lp250
V(Laughter)
p251
aa(lp252
VI said, "Mom, I'm going to learn how to fly."
p253
aVShe said, "That's nice, dear."
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
VI said, "Pass me the yellow pages."
p258
aVShe passed me the phone book, I rang up the flying school,
p259
aVI said I'd like to make a booking to come out for a flight.
p260
aVThey said, "When do you want to come out?"
p261
aVI said, "Well, I have to get a friend to drive me because I can't drive.
p262
aVSort of can't walk, either. Is that a problem?"
p263
aVI made a booking, and weeks later,
p264
aVmy friend Chris and my mom drove me out to the airport,
p265
aVall 80 pounds of me covered in a plaster body cast
p266
aVin a baggy pair of overalls.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VI can tell you, I did not look like the ideal candidate
p271
aVto get a pilot's license.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Laughter)
p274
aa(lp275
VI'm holding on to the counter because I can't stand.
p276
aVI said, "Hi, I'm here for a flying lesson."
p277
aVThey took one look and ran out the back to draw short straws.
p278
aV"You get her." "No, no, you take her."
p279
aVFinally a guy goes, "Hi, I'm Andrew. I'm going to take you flying."
p280
aVI go, "Great!"
p281
aVThey get me out on the tarmac,
p282
aVand there was this red, white and blue airplane \u2014 it was beautiful.
p283
aVThey had to slide me up on the wing to put me in the cockpit.
p284
aVThey sat me down. There are buttons and dials everywhere.
p285
aVI'm going, "Wow, how do you ever know what all these buttons and dials do?"
p286
aVAndrew got in the front, started the plane, and said,
p287
aV"Would you like to have a go at taxiing?"
p288
aVThat's when you use your feet to control the rudder pedals
p289
aVto control the airplane on the ground.
p290
aVI said, "No, I can't use my legs."
p291
aVHe went, "Oh."
p292
aVI said, "But I can use my hands," and he said, "OK."
p293
aa(lp294
VSo he got over to the runway, and he applied the power.
p295
aVAnd as we took off down the runway,
p296
aVand the wheels lifted up off the tarmac, and we became airborne,
p297
aVI had the most incredible sense of freedom.
p298
aVAnd Andrew said to me,
p299
aVas we got over the training area,
p300
aV"You see that mountain over there?"
p301
aVAnd I said, "Yeah."
p302
aVAnd he said, "Well, you take the controls, and you fly towards that mountain."
p303
aVAnd as I looked up, I realized
p304
aVthat he was pointing towards the Blue Mountains,
p305
aVwhere the journey had begun.
p306
aVAnd I took the controls,
p307
aVand I was flying.
p308
aVAnd I was a long, long way from that spinal ward.
p309
aVI knew right then that I was going to be a pilot.
p310
aVDidn't know how on Earth I'd ever pass a medical.
p311
aa(lp312
V(Laughter)
p313
aa(lp314
VBut I'd worry about that later, because right now, I had a dream.
p315
aVSo I went home, I got a training diary out, and I had a plan.
p316
aVAnd I practiced my walking as much as I could,
p317
aVand I went from the point of two people holding me up ...
p318
aVto one person holding me up ...
p319
aVto the point where I could walk around the furniture
p320
aVas long as it wasn't too far apart.
p321
aVAnd then I made great progression,
p322
aVto the point where I could walk around the house,
p323
aVholding onto the walls, like this.
p324
aVAnd Mom said she was forever following me,
p325
aVwiping off my fingerprints.
p326
aa(lp327
V(Laughter)
p328
aa(lp329
VBut at least she always knew where I was.
p330
aa(lp331
V(Laughter)
p332
aa(lp333
VSo while the doctors continued to operate
p334
aVand put my body back together again,
p335
aVI went on with my theory study.
p336
aVAnd then eventually, amazingly, I passed my pilot's medical,
p337
aVand that was my green light to fly.
p338
aVAnd I spent every moment I could out at that flying school,
p339
aVway out of my comfort zone,
p340
aVall these young guys that wanted to be Qantas pilots, you know,
p341
aVand little old hop-along me in first my plaster cast,
p342
aVand then my steel brace, my baggy overalls,
p343
aVmy bag of medication and catheters and my limp.
p344
aVThey use to look at me and think,
p345
aV"Oh, who is she kidding? She's never going to be able to do this."
p346
aVAnd sometimes I thought that, too.
p347
aVBut that didn't matter,
p348
aVbecause now there was something inside that burned
p349
aVthat far outweighed my injuries.
p350
aa(lp351
VAnd little goals kept me going along the way,
p352
aVand eventually I got my private pilot's license.
p353
aVThen I learned to navigate, and I flew my friends around Australia.
p354
aVAnd then I learned to fly an airplane with two engines
p355
aVand I got my twin-engine rating.
p356
aVAnd then I learned to fly in bad weather as well as fine weather,
p357
aVand got my instrument rating.
p358
aVAnd then I got my commercial pilot's license.
p359
aVAnd then I got my instructor rating.
p360
aVAnd then I found myself back at that same school
p361
aVwhere I'd gone for that very first flight,
p362
aVteaching other people how to fly ...
p363
aVjust under 18 months after I'd left the spinal ward.
p364
aa(lp365
V(Applause)
p366
aa(lp367
V(Applause ends)
p368
aa(lp369
VAnd then I thought, "Why stop there?
p370
aVWhy not learn to fly upside down?"
p371
aa(lp372
V(Laughter)
p373
aa(lp374
VAnd I did, and I learned to fly upside down
p375
aVand became an aerobatics flying instructor.
p376
aa(lp377
V(Laughter)
p378
aa(lp379
VAnd Mom and Dad? Never been up.
p380
aa(lp381
V(Laughter)
p382
aa(lp383
VBut then I knew for certain that although my body might be limited,
p384
aVit was my spirit that was unstoppable.
p385
aa(lp386
VThe philosopher Lao Tzu once said,
p387
aV"When you let go of what you are,
p388
aVyou become what you might be."
p389
aVI now know that it wasn't until I let go of who I thought I was
p390
aVthat I was able to create a completely new life.
p391
aVIt wasn't until I let go of the life I thought I should have ...
p392
aVthat I was able to embrace the life that was waiting for me.
p393
aVI now know that my real strength
p394
aVnever came from my body.
p395
aVAnd although my physical capabilities have changed dramatically,
p396
aVwho I am is unchanged.
p397
aVThe pilot light inside of me was still alight,
p398
aVjust as it is in each and every one of us.
p399
aa(lp400
VI know that I'm not my body.
p401
aVAnd I also know that you're not yours.
p402
aVAnd then it no longer matters what you look like,
p403
aVwhere you come from, or what you do for a living.
p404
aVAll that matters is that we continue to fan the flame of humanity
p405
aVby living our lives as the ultimate creative expression
p406
aVof who we really are,
p407
aVbecause we are all connected
p408
aVby millions and millions of straws.
p409
aVAnd it's time to join those up
p410
aVand to hang on.
p411
aVAnd if we are to move towards our collective bliss ...
p412
aVit's time we shed our focus on the physical
p413
aVand instead embrace the virtues of the heart.
p414
aa(lp415
VSo raise your straws if you'll join me.
p416
aa(lp417
V(Applause)
p418
aa(lp419
VThank you.
p420
aa(lp421

p422
