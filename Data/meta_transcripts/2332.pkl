(lp3
VWow, what an honor. I always wondered what this would feel like.
p4
aa(lp5
VSo eight years ago, I got the worst career advice of my life.
p6
aVI had a friend tell me,
p7
aV"Don't worry about how much you like the work you're doing now.
p8
aVIt's all about just building your resume."
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd I'd just come back from living in Spain for a while,
p11
aVand I'd joined this Fortune 500 company. I thought, "This is fantastic.
p12
aVI'm going to have big impact on the world."
p13
aVI had all these ideas. And within about two months,
p14
aVI noticed at about 10am every morning I had this strange urge
p15
aVto want to slam my head through the monitor of my computer.
p16
aVI don't know if anyone's ever felt that.
p17
aVAnd I noticed pretty soon after that that all the competitors in our space
p18
aVhad already automated my job role.
p19
aVAnd this is right about when I got this sage advice to build up my resume.
p20
aa(lp21
VWell, as I'm trying to figure out
p22
aVwhat two-story window I'm going to jump out of and change things up,
p23
aVI read some altogether different advice from Warren Buffett, and he said,
p24
aV"Taking jobs to build up your resume is the same as saving up sex for old age."
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd I heard that, and that was all I needed.
p29
aVWithin two weeks, I was out of there, and I left with one intention:
p30
aVto find something that I could screw up. That's how tough it was.
p31
aVI wanted to have some type of impact. It didn't matter what it was.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd I found pretty quickly that I wasn't alone:
p34
aVit turns out that over 80 percent of the people around
p35
aVdon't enjoy their work.
p36
aVI'm guessing this room is different,
p37
aVbut that's the average that Deloitte has done with their studies.
p38
aVSo I wanted to find out, what is it that sets these people apart,
p39
aVthe people who do the passionate, world-changing work,
p40
aVthat wake up inspired every day,
p41
aVand then these people, the other 80 percent
p42
aVwho lead these lives of quiet desperation.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo I started to interview all these people doing this inspiring work,
p45
aVand I read books and did case studies,
p46
aV300 books altogether on purpose and career and all this,
p47
aVtotally just self-immersion, really for the selfish reason of \u2014
p48
aVI wanted to find the work that I couldn't not do,
p49
aVwhat that was for me.
p50
aa(lp51
VBut as I was doing this, more and more people started to ask me,
p52
aV"You're into this career thing.
p53
aVI don't like my job. Can we sit down for lunch?"
p54
aVI'd say, "Sure." But I would have to warn them,
p55
aVbecause at this point, my quit rate was also 80 percent.
p56
aVOf the people I'd sit down with for lunch, 80 percent would quit their job
p57
aVwithin two months.
p58
aVI was proud of this, and it wasn't that I had any special magic.
p59
aVIt was that I would ask one simple question.
p60
aVIt was, "Why are you doing the work that you're doing?"
p61
aVAnd so often their answer would be,
p62
aV"Well, because somebody told me I'm supposed to."
p63
aVAnd I realized that so many people around us
p64
aVare climbing their way up this ladder that someone tells them to climb,
p65
aVand it ends up being leaned up against the wrong wall,
p66
aVor no wall at all.
p67
aa(lp68
VThe more time I spent around these people and saw this problem,
p69
aVI thought, what if we could create a community,
p70
aVa place where people could feel like they belonged
p71
aVand that it was OK to do things differently,
p72
aVto take the road less traveled, where that was encouraged,
p73
aVand inspire people to change?
p74
aVAnd that later became what I now call Live Your Legend,
p75
aVwhich I'll explain in a little bit.
p76
aVBut as I've made these discoveries, I noticed a framework
p77
aVof really three simple things
p78
aVthat all these different passionate world-changers have in common,
p79
aVwhether you're a Steve Jobs or if you're just, you know,
p80
aVthe person that has the bakery down the street.
p81
aVBut you're doing work that embodies who you are.
p82
aVI want to share those three with you, so we can use them as a lens
p83
aVfor the rest of today and hopefully the rest of our life.
p84
aa(lp85
VThe first part of this three-step passionate work framework
p86
aVis becoming a self-expert and understanding yourself,
p87
aVbecause if you don't know what you're looking for,
p88
aVyou're never going to find it.
p89
aVAnd the thing is that no one is going to do this for us.
p90
aVThere's no major in university on passion and purpose and career.
p91
aVI don't know how that's not a required double major,
p92
aVbut don't even get me started on that.
p93
aVI mean, you spend more time picking out a dorm room TV set
p94
aVthan you do you picking your major and your area of study.
p95
aVBut the point is, it's on us to figure that out,
p96
aVand we need a framework, we need a way to navigate through this.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd so the first step of our compass is finding out what our unique strengths are.
p99
aVWhat are the things that we wake up loving to do no matter what,
p100
aVwhether we're paid or we're not paid, the things that people thank us for?
p101
aVAnd the Strengths Finder 2.0 is a book and also an online tool.
p102
aVI highly recommend it for sorting out what it is that you're naturally good at.
p103
aa(lp104
VAnd next, what's our framework or our hierarchy for making decisions?
p105
aVDo we care about the people, our family, health,
p106
aVor is it achievement, success, all this stuff?
p107
aVWe have to figure out what it is to make these decisions,
p108
aVso we know what our soul is made of,
p109
aVso that we don't go selling it to some cause we don't give a shit about.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd then the next step is our experiences.
p112
aVAll of us have these experiences. We learn things every day, every minute
p113
aVabout what we love, what we hate,
p114
aVwhat we're good at, what we're terrible at.
p115
aVAnd if we don't spend time paying attention to that
p116
aVand assimilating that learning
p117
aVand applying it to the rest of our lives, it's all for nothing.
p118
aVEvery day, every week, every month of every year
p119
aVI spend some time just reflecting on what went right,
p120
aVwhat went wrong, and what do I want to repeat,
p121
aVwhat can I apply more to my life.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd even more so than that, as you see people, especially today,
p124
aVwho inspire you, who are doing things where you say
p125
aV"Oh God, what Jeff is doing, I want to be like him."
p126
aVWhy are you saying that? Open up a journal.
p127
aVWrite down what it is about them that inspires you.
p128
aVIt's not going to be everything about their life,
p129
aVbut whatever it is, take note on that,
p130
aVso over time we'll have this repository of things
p131
aVthat we can use to apply to our life and have a more passionate existence
p132
aVand make a better impact.
p133
aVBecause when we start to put these things together,
p134
aVwe can then define what success actually means to us,
p135
aVand without these different parts of the compass, it's impossible.
p136
aVWe end up in the situation \u2014 we have that scripted life
p137
aVthat everybody seems to be living going up this ladder to nowhere.
p138
aa(lp139
VIt's kind of like in Wall Street 2, if anybody saw that,
p140
aVthe peon employee asks the big Wall Street banker CEO,
p141
aV"What's your number? Everyone's got a number,
p142
aVwhere if they make this money, they'll leave it all."
p143
aVHe says, "Oh, it's simple. More."
p144
aVAnd he just smiles.
p145
aVAnd it's the sad state of most of the people
p146
aVthat haven't spent time understanding what matters for them,
p147
aVwho keep reaching for something that doesn't mean anything to us,
p148
aVbut we're doing it because everyone said we're supposed to.
p149
aVBut once we have this framework together,
p150
aVwe can start to identify the things that make us come alive.
p151
aVYou know, before this, a passion could come and hit you in the face,
p152
aVor maybe in your possible line of work, you might throw it away
p153
aVbecause you don't have a way of identifying it.
p154
aVBut once you do, you can see something that's congruent with my strengths,
p155
aVmy values, who I am as a person,
p156
aVso I'm going to grab ahold of this, I'm going to do something with it,
p157
aVand I'm going to pursue it and try to make an impact with it.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd Live Your Legend and the movement we've built
p160
aVwouldn't exist if I didn't have this compass to identify,
p161
aV"Wow, this is something I want to pursue and make a difference with."
p162
aVIf we don't know what we're looking for, we're never going to find it,
p163
aVbut once we have this framework, this compass,
p164
aVthen we can move on to what's next \u2014 and that's not me up there \u2014
p165
aVdoing the impossible and pushing our limits.
p166
aVThere's two reasons why people don't do things.
p167
aVOne is they tell themselves they can't do them,
p168
aVor people around them tell them they can't do them.
p169
aVEither way, we start to believe it.
p170
aVEither we give up, or we never start in the first place.
p171
aa(lp172
VThe things is, everyone was impossible until somebody did it.
p173
aVEvery invention, every new thing in the world,
p174
aVpeople thought were crazy at first.
p175
aVRoger Bannister and the four-minute mile, it was a physical impossibility
p176
aVto break the four-minute mile in a foot race
p177
aVuntil Roger Bannister stood up and did it.
p178
aVAnd then what happened?
p179
aVTwo months later, 16 people broke the four-minute mile.
p180
aVThe things that we have in our head that we think are impossible
p181
aVare often just milestones waiting to be accomplished
p182
aVif we can push those limits a bit.
p183
aVAnd I think this starts with probably your physical body and fitness
p184
aVmore than anything, because we can control that.
p185
aVIf you don't think you can run a mile,
p186
aVyou show yourself you can run a mile or two,
p187
aVor a marathon, or lose five pounds, or whatever it is,
p188
aVyou realize that confidence compounds
p189
aVand can be transferred into the rest of your world.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd I've actually gotten into the habit of this a little bit with my friends.
p192
aVWe have this little group. We go on physical adventures,
p193
aVand recently, I found myself in a kind of precarious spot.
p194
aVI'm terrified of deep, dark, blue water.
p195
aVI don't know if anyone's ever had that same fear
p196
aVever since they watched Jaws 1, 2, 3 and 4 like six times
p197
aVwhen I was a kid.
p198
aVBut anything above here, if it's murky, I can already feel it right now.
p199
aVI swear there's something in there.
p200
aVEven if it's Lake Tahoe, it's fresh water, totally unfounded fear,
p201
aVridiculous, but it's there.
p202
aVAnyway, three years ago I find myself on this tugboat
p203
aVright down here in the San Francisco Bay.
p204
aVIt's a rainy, stormy, windy day, and people are getting sick on the boat,
p205
aVand I'm sitting there wearing a wetsuit, and I'm looking out the window
p206
aVin pure terror thinking I'm about to swim to my death.
p207
aVI'm going to try to swim across the Golden Gate.
p208
aVAnd my guess is some people in this room might have done that before.
p209
aVI'm sitting there, and my buddy Jonathan, who had talked me into it,
p210
aVhe comes up to me and he could see the state I was in.
p211
aVAnd he says, "Scott, hey man, what's the worst that could happen?
p212
aVYou're wearing a wetsuit. You're not going to sink.
p213
aVAnd If you can't make it, just hop on one of the 20 kayaks.
p214
aVPlus, if there's a shark attack, why are they going to pick you
p215
aVover the 80 people in the water?" So thanks, that helps.
p216
aVHe's like, "But really, just have fun with this. Good luck."
p217
aVAnd he dives in, swims off. OK.
p218
aa(lp219
VTurns out, the pep talk totally worked, and I felt this total feeling of calm,
p220
aVand I think it was because Jonathan was 13 years old.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VAnd of the 80 people swimming that day,
p225
aV65 of them were between the ages of nine and 13.
p226
aVThink how you would have approached your world differently
p227
aVif at nine years old you found out you could swim a mile and a half
p228
aVin 56-degree water from Alcatraz to San Francisco.
p229
aVWhat would you have said yes to?
p230
aVWhat would you have not given up on? What would you have tried?
p231
aVAs I'm finishing this swim, I get to Aquatic Park,
p232
aVand I'm getting out of the water
p233
aVand of course half the kids are already finished,
p234
aVso they're cheering me on and they're all excited.
p235
aVAnd I got total popsicle head, if anyone's ever swam in the Bay,
p236
aVand I'm trying to just thaw my face out, and I'm watching people finish.
p237
aVAnd I see this one kid, something didn't look right.
p238
aVAnd he's just flailing like this.
p239
aVAnd he's barely able to sip some air before he slams his head back down.
p240
aVAnd I notice other parents were watching too,
p241
aVand I swear they were thinking the same thing I was:
p242
aVthis is why you don't let nine-year-olds swim from Alcatraz.
p243
aVThis was not fatigue.
p244
aVAll of a sudden, two parents run up and grab him,
p245
aVand they put him on their shoulders, and they're dragging him like this,
p246
aVtotally limp.
p247
aVAnd then all of a sudden they walk a few more feet
p248
aVand they plop him down in his wheelchair.
p249
aVAnd he puts his fists up in the most insane show of victory I've ever seen.
p250
aVI can still feel the warmth and the energy on this guy
p251
aVwhen he made this accomplishment.
p252
aVI had seen him earlier that day in his wheelchair.
p253
aVI just had no idea he was going to swim.
p254
aVI mean, where is he going to be in 20 years?
p255
aVHow many people told him he couldn't do that, that he would die if tried that?
p256
aa(lp257
VYou prove people wrong, you prove yourself wrong,
p258
aVthat you can make little incremental pushes
p259
aVof what you believe is possible.
p260
aVYou don't have to be the fastest marathoner in the world,
p261
aVjust your own impossibilities, to accomplish those,
p262
aVand it starts with little bitty steps.
p263
aVAnd the best way to do this
p264
aVis to surround yourself with passionate people.
p265
aVThe fastest things to do things you don't think can be done
p266
aVis to surround yourself with people already doing them.
p267
aa(lp268
VThere's this quote by Jim Rohn and it says.
p269
aV"You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with."
p270
aVAnd there is no bigger lifehack in the history of the world
p271
aVfrom getting where you are today to where you want to be
p272
aVthan the people you choose to put in your corner.
p273
aVThey change everything, and it's a proven fact.
p274
aVIn 1898, Norman Triplett did this study with a bunch of cyclists,
p275
aVand he would measure their times around the track in a group,
p276
aVand also individually.
p277
aVAnd he found that every time the cyclists in the group would cycle faster.
p278
aVAnd it's been repeated in all kinds of walks of life since then,
p279
aVand it proves the same thing over again,
p280
aVthat the people around you matter, and environment is everything.
p281
aVBut it's on you to control it, because it can go both ways.
p282
aVWith 80 percent of people who don't like the work they do,
p283
aVthat means most people around us, not in this room, but everywhere else,
p284
aVare encouraging complacency and keeping us from pursuing the things that matter to us
p285
aVso we have to manage those surroundings.
p286
aa(lp287
VI found myself in this situation \u2014
p288
aVpersonal example, a couple years ago.
p289
aVHas anyone ever had a hobby or a passion they poured their heart and soul into,
p290
aVunbelievable amount of time, and they so badly want to call it a business,
p291
aVbut no one's paying attention and it doesn't make a dime?
p292
aVOK, I was there for four years trying to build this Live Your Legend movement
p293
aVto help people do work that they genuinely cared about and that inspired them,
p294
aVand I was doing all I could,
p295
aVand there were only three people paying attention,
p296
aVand they're all right there: my mother, father and my wife, Chelsea.
p297
aVThank you guys for the support.
p298
aa(lp299
V(Applause)
p300
aa(lp301
VAnd this is how badly I wanted it, it grew at zero percent for four years,
p302
aVand I was about to shut it down,
p303
aVand right about then,
p304
aVI moved to San Francisco and started to meet some pretty interesting people
p305
aVwho had these crazy lifestyles of adventure,
p306
aVof businesses and websites and blogs
p307
aVthat surrounded their passions and helped people in a meaningful way.
p308
aVAnd one of my friends, now, he has a family of eight,
p309
aVand he supports his whole family
p310
aVwith a blog that he writes for twice a week.
p311
aVThey just came back from a month in Europe, all of them together.
p312
aVThis blew my mind. How does this even exist?
p313
aVAnd I got unbelievably inspired by seeing this,
p314
aVand instead of shutting it down, I decided, let's take it seriously.
p315
aVAnd I did everything I could to spend my time,
p316
aVevery waking hour possible trying to hound these guys,
p317
aVhanging out and having beers and workouts, whatever it was.
p318
aVAnd after four years of zero growth,
p319
aVwithin six months of hanging around these people,
p320
aVthe community at Live Your Legend grew by 10 times.
p321
aVIn another 12 months, it grew by 160 times.
p322
aVAnd today over 30,000 people from 158 countries
p323
aVuse our career and connection tools on a monthly basis.
p324
aVAnd those people have made up that community of passionate folks
p325
aVwho inspired that possibility that I dreamed of
p326
aVfor Live Your Legend so many years back.
p327
aa(lp328
VThe people change everything, and this is why \u2014
p329
aVyou know, you ask what was going on.
p330
aVWell, for four years, I knew nobody in this space,
p331
aVand I didn't even know it existed, that people could do this stuff,
p332
aVthat you could have movements like this.
p333
aVAnd then I'm over here in San Francisco, and everyone around me was doing it.
p334
aVIt became normal, so my thinking went from how could I possibly do this
p335
aVto how could I possibly not.
p336
aVAnd right then, when that happens, that switch goes on in your head,
p337
aVit ripples across your whole world.
p338
aVAnd without even trying, your standards go from here to here.
p339
aVYou don't need to change your goals. You just need to change your surroundings.
p340
aVThat's it, and that's why I love being around this whole group of people,
p341
aVwhy I go to every TED event I can,
p342
aVand watch them on my iPad on the way to work, whatever it is.
p343
aVBecause this is the group of people that inspires possibility.
p344
aVWe have a whole day to spend together and plenty more.
p345
aa(lp346
VTo sum things up, in terms of these three pillars,
p347
aVthey all have one thing in common more than anything else.
p348
aVThey are 100 percent in our control.
p349
aVNo one can tell you you can't learn about yourself.
p350
aVNo one can tell you you can't push your limits
p351
aVand learn your own impossible and push that.
p352
aVNo one can tell you you can't surround yourself with inspiring people
p353
aVor get away from the people who bring you down.
p354
aVYou can't control a recession.
p355
aVYou can't control getting fired or getting in a car accident.
p356
aVMost things are totally out of our hands.
p357
aVThese three things are totally on us,
p358
aVand they can change our whole world if we decide to do something about it.
p359
aa(lp360
VAnd the thing is, it's starting to happen on a widespread level.
p361
aVI just read in Forbes, the US Government reported for the first time
p362
aVin a month where more people had quit their jobs
p363
aVthan had been laid off.
p364
aVThey thought this was an anomaly, but it's happened three months straight.
p365
aVIn a time where people claim it's kind of a tough environment,
p366
aVpeople are giving a middle finger to this scripted life,
p367
aVthe things that people say you're supposed to do,
p368
aVin exchange for things that matter to them and do the things that inspire them.
p369
aa(lp370
VAnd the thing is, people are waking up to this possibility,
p371
aVthat really the only thing that limits possibility now is imagination.
p372
aVThat's not a cliché anymore.
p373
aVI don't care what it is that you're into, what passion, what hobby.
p374
aVIf you're into knitting, you can find someone who is killing it knitting,
p375
aVand you can learn from them. It's wild.
p376
aVAnd that's what this whole day is about, to learn from the folks speaking,
p377
aVand we profile these people on Live Your Legend every day,
p378
aVbecause when ordinary people are doing the extraordinary,
p379
aVand we can be around that,
p380
aVit becomes normal.
p381
aVAnd this isn't about being Gandhi or Steve Jobs, doing something crazy.
p382
aVIt's just about doing something that matters to you,
p383
aVand makes an impact that only you can make.
p384
aa(lp385
VSpeaking of Gandhi, he was a recovering lawyer,
p386
aVas I've heard the term,
p387
aVand he was called to a greater cause, something that mattered to him,
p388
aVhe couldn't not do.
p389
aVAnd he has this quote that I absolutely live by.
p390
aV"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you,
p391
aVthen they fight you, then you win."
p392
aa(lp393
VEverything was impossible until somebody did it.
p394
aVYou can either hang around the people who tell you it can't be done
p395
aVand tell you you're stupid for trying,
p396
aVor surround yourself with the people who inspire possibility,
p397
aVthe people who are in this room.
p398
aVBecause I see it as our responsibility to show the world
p399
aVthat what's seen as impossible can become that new normal.
p400
aVAnd that's already starting to happen.
p401
aVFirst, do the things that inspire us,
p402
aVso we can inspire other people to do the things that inspire them.
p403
aVBut we can't find that
p404
aVunless we know what we're looking for.
p405
aVWe have to do our work on ourself,
p406
aVbe intentional about that, and make those discoveries.
p407

p408
aVWhat would that look like?

p415
aVDiscover that, live it,
p416
aVnot just for you, but for everybody around you,
p417
aVbecause that is what starts to change the world.
