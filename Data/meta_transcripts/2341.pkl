VRaise your hand if you've ever been asked the question
p4
aV"What do you want to be when you grow up?"
p5
aa(lp6
VNow if you had to guess,
p7
aVhow old would you say you were when you were first asked this question?
p8
aVYou can just hold up fingers.
p9
aVThree. Five. Three. Five. Five. OK.
p10
aVNow, raise your hand if the question
p11
aV"What do you want to be when you grow up?"
p12
aVhas ever caused you any anxiety.
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VAny anxiety at all.
p17
aa(lp18
VI'm someone who's never been able to answer the question
p19
aV"What do you want to be when you grow up?"
p20
aa(lp21
VSee, the problem wasn't that I didn't have any interests \u2014
p22
aVit's that I had too many.
p23
aVIn high school, I liked English and math and art and I built websites
p24
aVand I played guitar in a punk band called Frustrated Telephone Operator.
p25
aVMaybe you've heard of us.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VThis continued after high school,
p30
aVand at a certain point, I began to notice this pattern in myself
p31
aVwhere I would become interested in an area
p32
aVand I would dive in, become all-consumed,
p33
aVand I'd get to be pretty good at whatever it was,
p34
aVand then I would hit this point where I'd start to get bored.
p35
aVAnd usually I would try and persist anyway,
p36
aVbecause I had already devoted so much time and energy
p37
aVand sometimes money into this field.
p38
aVBut eventually this sense of boredom,
p39
aVthis feeling of, like, yeah, I got this, this isn't challenging anymore \u2014
p40
aVit would get to be too much.
p41
aVAnd I would have to let it go.
p42
aa(lp43
VBut then I would become interested in something else,
p44
aVsomething totally unrelated, and I would dive into that,
p45
aVand become all-consumed, and I'd be like, "Yes! I found my thing,"
p46
aVand then I would hit this point again where I'd start to get bored.
p47
aVAnd eventually, I would let it go.
p48
aVBut then I would discover something new and totally different,
p49
aVand I would dive into that.
p50
aa(lp51
VThis pattern caused me a lot of anxiety,
p52
aVfor two reasons.
p53
aVThe first was that I wasn't sure
p54
aVhow I was going to turn any of this into a career.
p55
aVI thought that I would eventually have to pick one thing,
p56
aVdeny all of my other passions,
p57
aVand just resign myself to being bored.
p58
aVThe other reason it caused me so much anxiety
p59
aVwas a little bit more personal.
p60
aVI worried that there was something wrong with this,
p61
aVand something wrong with me for being unable to stick with anything.
p62
aVI worried that I was afraid of commitment,
p63
aVor that I was scattered, or that I was self-sabotaging,
p64
aVafraid of my own success.
p65
aa(lp66
VIf you can relate to my story and to these feelings,
p67
aVI'd like you to ask yourself a question
p68
aVthat I wish I had asked myself back then.
p69
aVAsk yourself where you learned to assign the meaning of wrong or abnormal
p70
aVto doing many things.
p71
aVI'll tell you where you learned it:
p72
aVyou learned it from the culture.
p73
aa(lp74
VWe are first asked the question "What do you want to be when you grow up?"
p75
aVwhen we're about five years old.
p76
aVAnd the truth is that no one really cares what you say when you're that age.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
VIt's considered an innocuous question,
p81
aVposed to little kids to elicit cute replies,
p82
aVlike, "I want to be an astronaut," or "I want to be a ballerina,"
p83
aVor "I want to be a pirate."
p84
aVInsert Halloween costume here.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VBut this question gets asked of us again and again as we get older
p89
aVin various forms \u2014 for instance, high school students might get asked
p90
aVwhat major they're going to pick in college.
p91
aVAnd at some point,
p92
aV"What do you want to be when you grow up?"
p93
aVgoes from being the cute exercise it once was
p94
aVto the thing that keeps us up at night.
p95
aVWhy?
p96
aa(lp97
VSee, while this question inspires kids to dream about what they could be,
p98
aVit does not inspire them to dream about all that they could be.
p99
aVIn fact, it does just the opposite,
p100
aVbecause when someone asks you what you want to be,
p101
aVyou can't reply with 20 different things,
p102
aVthough well-meaning adults will likely chuckle and be like,
p103
aV"Oh, how cute, but you can't be a violin maker and a psychologist.
p104
aVYou have to choose."
p105
aa(lp106
VThis is Dr. Bob Childs \u2014
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
Vand he's a luthier and psychotherapist.
p111
aVAnd this is Amy Ng, a magazine editor turned illustrator, entrepreneur,
p112
aVteacher and creative director.
p113
aVBut most kids don't hear about people like this.
p114
aVAll they hear
p115
aVis that they're going to have to choose.
p116
aVBut it's more than that.
p117
aVThe notion of the narrowly focused life
p118
aVis highly romanticized in our culture.
p119
aVIt's this idea of destiny or the one true calling,
p120
aVthe idea that we each have one great thing
p121
aVwe are meant to do during our time on this earth,
p122
aVand you need to figure out what that thing is
p123
aVand devote your life to it.
p124
aa(lp125
VBut what if you're someone who isn't wired this way?
p126
aVWhat if there are a lot of different subjects that you're curious about,
p127
aVand many different things you want to do?
p128
aVWell, there is no room for someone like you in this framework.
p129
aVAnd so you might feel alone.
p130
aVYou might feel like you don't have a purpose.
p131
aVAnd you might feel like there's something wrong with you.
p132
aVThere's nothing wrong with you.
p133
aVWhat you are is a multipotentialite.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
V(Applause)
p138
aa(lp139
VA multipotentialite is someone with many interests and creative pursuits.
p140
aVIt's a mouthful to say.
p141
aVIt might help if you break it up into three parts:
p142
aVmulti, potential, and ite.
p143
aVYou can also use one of the other terms that connote the same idea,
p144
aVsuch as polymath, the Renaissance person.
p145
aVActually, during the Renaissance period,
p146
aVit was considered the ideal to be well-versed in multiple disciplines.
p147
aVBarbara Sher refers to us as "scanners."
p148
aVUse whichever term you like, or invent your own.
p149
aVI have to say I find it sort of fitting that as a community,
p150
aVwe cannot agree on a single identity.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VIt's easy to see your multipotentiality
p155
aVas a limitation or an affliction that you need to overcome.
p156
aVBut what I've learned through speaking with people
p157
aVand writing about these ideas on my website,
p158
aVis that there are some tremendous strengths to being this way.
p159
aVHere are three
p160
aVmultipotentialite super powers.
p161
aa(lp162
VOne: idea synthesis.
p163
aVThat is, combining two or more fields
p164
aVand creating something new at the intersection.
p165
aVSha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew from their shared interests
p166
aVin cartography, data visualization, travel, mathematics and design,
p167
aVwhen they founded Meshu.
p168
aVMeshu is a company that creates custom geographically-inspired jewelry.
p169
aVSha and Rachel came up with this unique idea
p170
aVnot despite, but because of their eclectic mix of skills and experiences.
p171
aVInnovation happens at the intersections.
p172
aVThat's where the new ideas come from.
p173
aVAnd multipotentialites, with all of their backgrounds,
p174
aVare able to access a lot of these points of intersection.
p175
aa(lp176
VThe second multipotentialite superpower
p177
aVis rapid learning.
p178
aVWhen multipotentialites become interested in something,
p179
aVwe go hard.
p180
aVWe observe everything we can get our hands on.
p181
aVWe're also used to being beginners,
p182
aVbecause we've been beginners so many times in the past,
p183
aVand this means that we're less afraid of trying new things
p184
aVand stepping out of our comfort zones.
p185
aVWhat's more, many skills are transferable across disciplines,
p186
aVand we bring everything we've learned to every new area we pursue,
p187
aVso we're rarely starting from scratch.
p188
aa(lp189
VNora Dunn is a full-time traveler and freelance writer.
p190
aVAs a child concert pianist, she honed an incredible ability
p191
aVto develop muscle memory.
p192
aVNow, she's the fastest typist she knows.
p193
aa(lp194
V(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VBefore becoming a writer, Nora was a financial planner.
p197
aVShe had to learn the finer mechanics of sales
p198
aVwhen she was starting her practice,
p199
aVand this skill now helps her write compelling pitches to editors.
p200
aVIt is rarely a waste of time to pursue something you're drawn to,
p201
aVeven if you end up quitting.
p202
aVYou might apply that knowledge in a different field entirely,
p203
aVin a way that you couldn't have anticipated.
p204
aa(lp205
VThe third multipotentialite superpower
p206
aVis adaptability;
p207
aVthat is, the ability to morph into whatever you need to be
p208
aVin a given situation.
p209
aVAbe Cajudo is sometimes a video director, sometimes a web designer,
p210
aVsometimes a Kickstarter consultant, sometimes a teacher,
p211
aVand sometimes, apparently, James Bond.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VHe's valuable because he does good work.
p216
aVHe's even more valuable because he can take on various roles,
p217
aVdepending on his clients' needs.
p218
aVFast Company magazine identified adaptability
p219
aVas the single most important skill to develop in order to thrive
p220
aVin the 21st century.
p221
aVThe economic world is changing so quickly and unpredictably
p222
aVthat it is the individuals and organizations that can pivot
p223
aVin order to meet the needs of the market that are really going to thrive.
p224
aa(lp225
VIdea synthesis, rapid learning and adaptability:
p226
aVthree skills that multipotentialites are very adept at,
p227
aVand three skills that they might lose if pressured to narrow their focus.
p228
aVAs a society, we have a vested interest in encouraging multipotentialites
p229
aVto be themselves.
p230
aVWe have a lot of complex, multidimensional problems in the world right now,
p231
aVand we need creative, out-of-the-box thinkers to tackle them.
p232
aa(lp233
VNow, let's say that you are, in your heart, a specialist.
p234
aVYou came out of the womb knowing you wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon.
p235
aVDon't worry \u2014 there's nothing wrong with you, either.
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VIn fact, some of the best teams are comprised of a specialist
p240
aVand multipotentialite paired together.
p241
aVThe specialist can dive in deep and implement ideas,
p242
aVwhile the multipotentialite brings a breadth of knowledge to the project.
p243
aVIt's a beautiful partnership.
p244
aVBut we should all be designing lives and careers
p245
aVthat are aligned with how we're wired.
p246
aVAnd sadly, multipotentialites are largely being encouraged
p247
aVsimply to be more like their specialist peers.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo with that said,
p250
aVif there is one thing you take away from this talk,
p251
aVI hope that it is this:
p252
aVembrace your inner wiring, whatever that may be.
p253
aVIf you're a specialist at heart,
p254
aVthen by all means, specialize.
p255
aVThat is where you'll do your best work.
p256
aVBut to the multipotentialites in the room,
p257
aVincluding those of you who may have just realized
p258
aVin the last 12 minutes that you are one \u2014
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
Vto you I say:
p263
aVembrace your many passions.
p264
aVFollow your curiosity down those rabbit holes.
p265
aVExplore your intersections.
p266
aVEmbracing our inner wiring leads to a happier, more authentic life.
p267
aVAnd perhaps more importantly \u2014
p268
aVmultipotentialites, the world needs us.
p269
aa(lp270
VThank you.
