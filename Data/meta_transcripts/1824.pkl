VWhen my father and I started a company
p4
aVto 3D print human tissues and organs,
p5
aVsome people initially thought we were a little crazy.
p6
aVBut since then, much progress has been made,
p7
aVboth in our lab and other labs around the world.
p8
aVAnd given this, we started getting questions like,
p9
aV"If you can grow human body parts,
p10
aVcan you also grow animal products like meat and leather?"
p11
aa(lp12
VWhen someone first suggested this to me,
p13
aVquite frankly I thought they were a little crazy,
p14
aVbut what I soon came to realize
p15
aVwas that this is not so crazy after all.
p16
aVWhat's crazy is what we do today.
p17
aVI'm convinced that in 30 years,
p18
aVwhen we look back on today
p19
aVand on how we raise and slaughter billions of animals
p20
aVto make our hamburgers and our handbags,
p21
aVwe'll see this as being wasteful
p22
aVand indeed crazy.
p23
aVDid you know that today we maintain
p24
aVa global herd of 60 billion animals
p25
aVto provide our meat, dairy, eggs and leather goods?
p26
aVAnd over the next few decades,
p27
aVas the world's population expands to 10 billion,
p28
aVthis will need to nearly double
p29
aVto 100 billion animals.
p30
aa(lp31
VBut maintaining this herd
p32
aVtakes a major toll on our planet.
p33
aVAnimals are not just raw materials.
p34
aVThey're living beings,
p35
aVand already our livestock
p36
aVis one of the largest users of land,
p37
aVfresh water,
p38
aVand one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases
p39
aVwhich drive climate change.
p40
aVOn top of this,
p41
aVwhen you get so many animals so close together,
p42
aVit creates a breeding ground for disease
p43
aVand opportunities for harm and abuse.
p44
aVClearly, we cannot continue on this path
p45
aVwhich puts the environment, public health,
p46
aVand food security at risk.
p47
aa(lp48
VThere is another way, because essentially,
p49
aVanimal products are just collections of tissues,
p50
aVand right now we breed and raise
p51
aVhighly complex animals
p52
aVonly to create products
p53
aVthat are made of relatively simple tissues.
p54
aVWhat if, instead of starting with a complex
p55
aVand sentient animal,
p56
aVwe started with what the tissues are made of,
p57
aVthe basic unit of life,
p58
aVthe cell?
p59
aa(lp60
VThis is biofabrication, where cells themselves
p61
aVcan be used to grow biological products
p62
aVlike tissues and organs.
p63
aVAlready in medicine,
p64
aVbiofabrication techniques have been used
p65
aVto grow sophisticated body parts,
p66
aVlike ears, windpipes, skin, blood vessels and bone,
p67
aVthat have been successfully implanted into patients.
p68
aVAnd beyond medicine, biofabrication can be
p69
aVa humane, sustainable and scalable new industry.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd we should begin by reimagining leather.
p72
aVI emphasize leather because it is so widely used.
p73
aVIt is beautiful, and it has long been a part of our history.
p74
aVGrowing leather is also technically simpler
p75
aVthan growing other animal products like meat.
p76
aVIt mainly uses one cell type,
p77
aVand it is largely two-dimensional.
p78
aVIt is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators.
p79
aVUntil biofabrication is better understood,
p80
aVit is clear that, initially at least,
p81
aVmore people would be willing to wear novel materials
p82
aVthan would be willing to eat novel foods,
p83
aVno matter how delicious.
p84
aVIn this sense, leather is a gateway material,
p85
aVa beginning for the mainstream biofabrication industry.
p86
aVIf we can succeed here,
p87
aVit brings our other consumer bioproducts like meat
p88
aVcloser on the horizon.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow how do we do it?
p91
aVTo grow leather, we begin by taking cells
p92
aVfrom an animal, through a simple biopsy.
p93
aVThe animal could be a cow,
p94
aVlamb, or even something more exotic.
p95
aVThis process does no harm,
p96
aVand Daisy the cow can live a happy life.
p97
aVWe then isolate the skin cells
p98
aVand multiply them in a cell culture medium.
p99
aVThis takes millions of cells
p100
aVand expands them into billions.
p101
aVAnd we then coax these cells to produce collagen,
p102
aVas they would naturally.
p103
aVThis collagen is the stuff between cells.
p104
aVIt's natural connective tissue.
p105
aVIt's the extracellular matrix,
p106
aVbut in leather, it's the main building block.
p107
aVAnd what we next do is we take the cells and their collagen
p108
aVand we spread them out to form sheets,
p109
aVand then we layer these thin sheets on top of one another,
p110
aVlike phyllo pastry, to form thicker sheets,
p111
aVwhich we then let mature.
p112
aVAnd finally, we take this multilayered skin
p113
aVand through a shorter and much less chemical tanning process,
p114
aVwe create leather.
p115
aVAnd so I'm very excited to show you,
p116
aVfor the first time,
p117
aVthe first batch of our cultured leather,
p118
aVfresh from the lab.
p119
aVThis is real, genuine leather,
p120
aVwithout the animal sacrifice.
p121
aVIt can have all the characteristics of leather
p122
aVbecause it is made of the same cells,
p123
aVand better yet,
p124
aVthere is no hair to remove,
p125
aVno scars or insect's bites,
p126
aVand no waste.
p127
aVThis leather can be grown in the shape of a wallet,
p128
aVa handbag or a car seat.
p129
aVIt is not limited to the irregular shape of a cow
p130
aVor an alligator.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd because we make this material,
p133
aVwe grow this leather from the ground up,
p134
aVwe can control its properties in very interesting ways.
p135
aVThis piece of leather
p136
aVis a mere seven tissue layers thick,
p137
aVand as you can see, it is nearly transparent.
p138
aVAnd this leather is 21 layers thick and quite opaque.
p139
aVYou don't have that kind of fine control
p140
aVwith conventional leather.
p141
aVAnd we can tune this leather for other desirable qualities,
p142
aVlike softness, breathability,
p143
aVdurability, elasticity and even things like pattern.
p144
aVWe can mimic nature,
p145
aVbut in some ways also improve upon it.
p146
aVThis type of leather can do what today's leather does,
p147
aVbut with imagination, probably much more.
p148
aa(lp149
VWhat could the future of animal products look like?
p150
aVIt need not look like this,
p151
aVwhich is actually the state of the art today.
p152
aVRather, it could be much more like this.
p153
aVAlready, we have been manufacturing with cell cultures
p154
aVfor thousands of years, beginning with products
p155
aVlike wine, beer and yogurt.
p156
aVAnd speaking of food, our cultured food has evolved,
p157
aVand today we prepare cultured food
p158
aVin beautiful, sterile facilities like this.
p159
aVA brewery is essentially a bioreactor.
p160
aVIt is where cell culture takes place.
p161
aVImagine that in this facility,
p162
aVinstead of brewing beer,
p163
aVwe were brewing leather
p164
aVor meat.
p165
aVImagine touring this facility,
p166
aVlearning about how the leather or meat is cultured,
p167
aVseeing the process from beginning to end,
p168
aVand even trying some.
p169
aVIt's clean, open and educational,
p170
aVand this is in contrast to the hidden,
p171
aVguarded and remote factories
p172
aVwhere leather and meat is produced today.
p173
aVPerhaps biofabrication
p174
aVis a natural evolution of manufacturing for mankind.
p175
aVIt's environmentally responsible,
p176
aVefficient and humane.
p177
aVIt allows us to be creative.
p178
aVWe can design new materials, new products,
p179
aVand new facilities.
p180
aVWe need to move past just killing animals
p181
aVas a resource
p182
aVto something more civilized and evolved.
p183
aVPerhaps we are ready for something
p184
aVliterally and figuratively more cultured.
