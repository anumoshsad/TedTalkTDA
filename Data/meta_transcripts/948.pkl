VThis strange-looking plant is called the Llareta.
p4
aVWhat looks like moss covering rocks
p5
aVis actually a shrub
p6
aVcomprised of thousands of branches,
p7
aVeach containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end
p8
aVand so densely packed together
p9
aVthat you could actually stand on top of it.
p10
aVThis individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile,
p11
aVand it happens to be 3,000 years old.
p12
aVIt also happens to be a relative of parsley.
p13
aa(lp14
VFor the past five years, I've been researching,
p15
aVworking with biologists
p16
aVand traveling all over the world
p17
aVto find continuously living organisms
p18
aVthat are 2,000 years old and older.
p19
aVThe project is part art and part science.
p20
aVThere's an environmental component.
p21
aVAnd I'm also trying to create a means
p22
aVin which to step outside our quotidian experience of time
p23
aVand to start to consider a deeper timescale.
p24
aVI selected 2,000 years as my minimum age
p25
aVbecause I wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero
p26
aVand work backward from there.
p27
aa(lp28
VWhat you're looking at now is a tree called Jomon Sugi,
p29
aVliving on the remote island of Yakushima.
p30
aVThe tree was in part a catalyst for the project.
p31
aVI'd been traveling in Japan
p32
aVwithout an agenda other than to photograph,
p33
aVand then I heard about this tree
p34
aVthat is 2,180 years old
p35
aVand knew that I had to go visit it.
p36
aVIt wasn't until later, when I was actually back home in New York
p37
aVthat I got the idea for the project.
p38
aVSo it was the slow churn, if you will.
p39
aVI think it was my longstanding desire
p40
aVto bring together my interest
p41
aVin art, science and philosophy
p42
aVthat allowed me to be ready
p43
aVwhen the proverbial light bulb went on.
p44
aVSo I started researching, and to my surprise,
p45
aVthis project had never been done before
p46
aVin the arts or the sciences.
p47
aVAnd \u2014 perhaps naively \u2014
p48
aVI was surprised to find that there isn't even an area in the sciences
p49
aVthat deals with this idea
p50
aVof global species longevity.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo what you're looking at here
p53
aVis the rhizocarpon geographicum, or map lichen,
p54
aVand this is around 3,000 years old
p55
aVand lives in Greenland,
p56
aVwhich is a long way to go for some lichens.
p57
aVVisiting Greenland was more like
p58
aVtraveling back in time
p59
aVthan just traveling very far north.
p60
aVIt was very primal and more remote
p61
aVthan anything I'd ever experienced before.
p62
aVAnd this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences.
p63
aVOne was when I had been dropped off by boat
p64
aVon a remote fjord,
p65
aVonly to find that the archeologists I was supposed to meet
p66
aVwere nowhere to be found.
p67
aVAnd it's not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e-mail,
p68
aVso I was literally left to my own devices.
p69
aVBut luckily, it worked out obviously,
p70
aVbut it was a humbling experience
p71
aVto feel so disconnected.
p72
aVAnd then a few days later,
p73
aVwe had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream
p74
aVnear our campsite,
p75
aVwhere the fish were so abundant
p76
aVthat you could literally reach into the stream
p77
aVand grab out a foot-long trout with your bare hands.
p78
aVIt was like visiting
p79
aVa more innocent time on the planet.
p80
aVAnd then, of course, there's the lichens.
p81
aVThese lichens grow only one centimeter
p82
aVevery hundred years.
p83
aVI think that really puts human lifespans
p84
aVinto a different perspective.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd what you're looking at here
p87
aVis an aerial photo take over eastern Oregon.
p88
aVAnd if the title "Searching for Armillaria Death Rings,"
p89
aVsounds ominous, it is.
p90
aVThe Armillaria is actually a predatory fungus,
p91
aVkilling certain species of trees in the forest.
p92
aVIt's also more benignly known
p93
aVas the honey mushroom or the "humongous fungus"
p94
aVbecause it happens to be
p95
aVone of the world's largest organisms as well.
p96
aVSo with the help of some biologists studying the fungus,
p97
aVI got some maps and some GPS coordinates
p98
aVand chartered a plane
p99
aVand started looking for the death rings,
p100
aVthe circular patterns
p101
aVin which the fungus kills the trees.
p102
aVSo I'm not sure if there are any in this photo,
p103
aVbut I do know the fungus is down there.
p104
aVAnd then this back down on the ground
p105
aVand you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree.
p106
aVSo that white material that you see
p107
aVin between the bark and the wood
p108
aVis the mycelial felt of the fungus,
p109
aVand what it's doing \u2014 it's actually
p110
aVslowly strangling the tree to death
p111
aVby preventing the flow of water and nutrients.
p112
aVSo this strategy has served it pretty well \u2014
p113
aVit's 2,400 years old.
p114
aVAnd then from underground to underwater.
p115
aa(lp116
VThis is a Brain Coral living in Tobago
p117
aVthat's around 2,000 years old.
p118
aVAnd I had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one.
p119
aVThis is at about 60 feet
p120
aVor 18 meters, depth.
p121
aVAnd you'll see, there's some damage to the surface of the coral.
p122
aVThat was actually caused by a school of parrot fish
p123
aVthat had started eating it,
p124
aVthough luckily, they lost interest before killing it.
p125
aVLuckily still, it seems to be out of harm's way
p126
aVof the recent oil spill.
p127
aVBut that being said, we just as easily could have lost
p128
aVone of the oldest living things on the planet,
p129
aVand the full impact of that disaster
p130
aVis still yet to be seen.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow this is something that I think
p133
aVis one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet.
p134
aVThis is clonal colony
p135
aVof Quaking Aspen trees, living in Utah,
p136
aVthat is literally 80,000 years old.
p137
aVWhat looks like a forest
p138
aVis actually only one tree.
p139
aVImagine that it's one giant root system
p140
aVand each tree is a stem
p141
aVcoming up from that system.
p142
aVSo what you have is one giant,
p143
aVinterconnected,
p144
aVgenetically identical individual
p145
aVthat's been living for 80,000 years.
p146
aVIt also happens to be male
p147
aVand, in theory immortal.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VThis is a clonal tree as well.
p152
aVThis is the spruce Gran Picea,
p153
aVwhich at 9,550 years
p154
aVis a mere babe in the woods.
p155
aVThe location of this tree
p156
aVis actually kept secret for its own protection.
p157
aVI spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree,
p158
aVand he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center
p159
aVis most likely a product of climate change.
p160
aVAs it's gotten warmer on the top of the mountain,
p161
aVthe vegetation zone is actually changing.
p162
aVSo we don't even necessarily have to have
p163
aVdirect contact with these organisms
p164
aVto have a very real impact on them.
p165
aa(lp166
VThis is the Fortingall Yew \u2014
p167
aVno, I'm just kidding \u2014
p168
aVthis is the Fortingall Yew.
p169
aV(Laughter)
p170
aVBut I put that slide in there
p171
aVbecause I'm often asked if there are any animals in the project.
p172
aVAnd aside from coral,
p173
aVthe answer is no.
p174
aVDoes anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is \u2014
p175
aVany guesses?
p176
aV(Audience: 300.)
p177
aVRachel Sussman: 300? No, 175
p178
aVis the oldest living tortoise,
p179
aVso nowhere near 2,000.
p180
aVAnd then, you might have heard
p181
aVof this giant clam that was discovered
p182
aVoff the coast of northern Iceland
p183
aVthat reached 405 years old.
p184
aVHowever, it died in the lab
p185
aVas they were determining its age.
p186
aVThe most interesting discovery of late, I think
p187
aVis the so-called immortal jellyfish,
p188
aVwhich has actually been observed in the lab
p189
aVto be able to be able to revert back to the polyp state
p190
aVafter reaching full maturity.
p191
aVSo that being said,
p192
aVit's highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild.
p193
aVAnd back to the yew here.
p194
aVSo as you can see, it's in a churchyard;
p195
aVit's in Scotland. It's behind a protective wall.
p196
aVAnd there are actually a number or ancient yews
p197
aVin churchyards around the U.K.,
p198
aVbut if you do the math, you'll remember
p199
aVit's actually the yew trees that were there first, then the churches.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd now down to another part of the world.
p202
aVI had the opportunity to travel around the Limpopo Province in South Africa
p203
aVwith an expert in Baobab trees.
p204
aVAnd we saw a number of them,
p205
aVand this is most likely the oldest.
p206
aVIt's around 2,000,
p207
aVand it's called the Sagole Baobab.
p208
aVAnd you know, I think of all of these organisms
p209
aVas palimpsests.
p210
aVThey contain thousands of years
p211
aVof their own histories within themselves,
p212
aVand they also contain records of natural and human events.
p213
aVAnd the Baobabs in particular
p214
aVare a great example of this.
p215
aVYou can see that this one
p216
aVhas names carved into its trunk,
p217
aVbut it also records some natural events.
p218
aVSo the Baobabs, as they get older,
p219
aVtend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out.
p220
aVAnd this can create
p221
aVgreat natural shelters for animals,
p222
aVbut they've also been appropriated
p223
aVfor some rather dubious human uses,
p224
aVincluding a bar, a prison
p225
aVand even a toilet inside of a tree.
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd this brings me to another favorite of mine \u2014
p228
aVI think, because it is just so unusual.
p229
aVThis plant is called the Welwitschia,
p230
aVand it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola,
p231
aVwhere it's uniquely adapted
p232
aVto collect moisture from mist coming off the sea.
p233
aVAnd what's more, it's actually a tree.
p234
aVIt's a primitive conifer.
p235
aVYou'll notice that it's bearing cones down the center.
p236
aVAnd what looks like two big heaps of leaves,
p237
aVis actually two single leaves
p238
aVthat get shredded up
p239
aVby the harsh desert conditions over time.
p240
aVAnd it actually never sheds those leaves,
p241
aVso it also bears the distinction
p242
aVof having the longest leaves
p243
aVin the plant kingdom.
p244
aVI spoke to a biologist
p245
aVat the Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden in Capetown
p246
aVto ask him
p247
aVwhere he thought this remarkable plant came from,
p248
aVand his thought was that
p249
aVif you travel around Namibia,
p250
aVyou see that there are a number of petrified forests,
p251
aVand the logs are all \u2014
p252
aVthe logs are all giant coniferous trees,
p253
aVand yet there's no sign of where they might have come from.
p254
aVSo his thought was that
p255
aVflooding in the north of Africa
p256
aVactually brought those coniferous trees down
p257
aVtens of thousands of years ago,
p258
aVand what resulted was this remarkable adaptation
p259
aVto this unique desert environment.
p260
aa(lp261
VThis is what I think is the most poetic of the oldest living things.
p262
aVThis is something called an underground forest.
p263
aVSo, I spoke to a botanist at the Pretoria Botanical Garden,
p264
aVwho explained that certain species of trees
p265
aVhave adapted to this region.
p266
aVIt's bushfelt region,
p267
aVwhich is dry and prone to a lot of fires,
p268
aVas so what these trees have done
p269
aVis, if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree,
p270
aVand that this is ground level,
p271
aVimagine that the whole thing,
p272
aVthat whole bulk of the tree,
p273
aVmigrated underground,
p274
aVand you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface.
p275
aVThat way, when a fire roars through,
p276
aVit's the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed.
p277
aVThe tree can easily recover.
p278
aVThese also tend to grow clonally,
p279
aVthe oldest of which is 13,000 years old.
p280
aa(lp281
VBack in the U.S., there's a couple plants of similar age.
p282
aVThis is the clonal Creosote bush,
p283
aVwhich is around 12,000 years old.
p284
aVIf you've been in the American West,
p285
aVyou know the Creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous,
p286
aVbut that being said, you see that this has
p287
aVthis unique, circular form.
p288
aVAnd what's happening is it's expanding slowly outwards
p289
aVfrom that original shape.
p290
aVAnd it's one \u2014 again, that interconnected root system,
p291
aVmaking it one genetically identical individual.
p292
aVIt also has a friend nearby \u2014
p293
aVwell, I think they're friends.
p294
aVThis is the clonal Mojave yucca, it's about a mile away,
p295
aVand it's a little bit older than 12,000 years.
p296
aVAnd you see it has that similar circular form.
p297
aVAnd there's some younger clones
p298
aVdotting the landscape behind it.
p299
aVAnd both of these, the yucca and the Creosote bush,
p300
aVlive on Bureau of Land Management land,
p301
aVand that's very different from being protected in a national park.
p302
aVIn fact, this land is designated
p303
aVfor recreational all-terrain vehicle use.
p304
aa(lp305
VSo, now I want to show what very well might be
p306
aVthe oldest living thing on the planet.
p307
aVThis is Siberian Actinobacteria,
p308
aVwhich is between 400,000
p309
aVand 600,000 years old.
p310
aVThis bacteria was discovered several years ago
p311
aVby a team of planetary biologists
p312
aVhoping to find clues to life on other planets
p313
aVby looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours.
p314
aVAnd what they found, by doing research into the permafrost,
p315
aVwas this bacteria.
p316
aVBut what's unique about it is that
p317
aVit's doing DNA repair below freezing.
p318
aVAnd what that means is that it's not dormant \u2014
p319
aVit's actually been living and growing
p320
aVfor half a million years.
p321
aVIt's also probably one the most vulnerable
p322
aVof the oldest living things,
p323
aVbecause if the permafrost melts,
p324
aVit won't survive.
p325
aa(lp326
VThis is a map that I've put together of the oldest living things,
p327
aVso you can get a sense of where they are; you see they're all over the world.
p328
aVThe blue flags represent things that I've already photographed,
p329
aVand the reds are places that I'm still trying to get to.
p330
aVYou'll see also, there's a flag on Antarctica.
p331
aVI'm trying to travel there
p332
aVto find 5,000 year-old moss,
p333
aVwhich lives on the Antarctic Peninsula.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo, I probably have about two more years left
p336
aVon this project \u2014
p337
aVon this phase of the project,
p338
aVbut after five years,
p339
aVI really feel like I know what's at the heart of this work.
p340
aVThe oldest living things in the world
p341
aVare a record and celebration of our past,
p342
aVa call to action in the present
p343
aVand a barometer of our future.
p344
aVThey've survived for millennia
p345
aVin desert, in the permafrost,
p346
aVat the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean.
p347
aVThey've withstood
p348
aVuntold natural perils and human encroachments,
p349
aVbut now some of them are in jeopardy,
p350
aVand they can't just get up and get out of the way.
p351
aVIt's my hope that, by going to find these organisms,
p352
aVthat I can help draw attention
p353
aVto their remarkable resilience
p354
aVand help play a part in insuring
p355
aVtheir continued longevity into the foreseeable future.
p356
