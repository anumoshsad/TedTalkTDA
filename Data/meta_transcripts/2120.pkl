VI just met you on a bus,
p4
aVand we would really like  to get to know each other,
p5
aVbut I've got to get off at the next stop,
p6
aVso you're going to tell me  three things about yourself
p7
aVthat just define you as a person,
p8
aVthree things about yourself
p9
aVthat will help me understand who you are,
p10
aVthree things that just  get to your very essence.
p11
aVAnd what I'm wondering
p12
aVis, of those three things,
p13
aVis any one of them
p14
aVsurviving some kind of trauma?
p15
aVCancer survivor, rape survivor,
p16
aVHolocaust survivor, incest survivor.
p17
aa(lp18
VEver notice how we tend to identify ourselves
p19
aVby our wounds?
p20
aVAnd where I have seen this survivor identity
p21
aVhave the most consequences
p22
aVis in the cancer community.
p23
aVAnd I've been around this  community for a long time,
p24
aVbecause I've been a hospice  and a hospital chaplain
p25
aVfor almost 30 years.
p26
aVAnd in 2005, I was working at a big cancer center
p27
aVwhen I received the news that
p28
aVmy mother had breast cancer.
p29
aVAnd then five days later,
p30
aVI received the news that I had breast cancer.
p31
aVMy mother and I can be competitive \u2014
p32
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p33
aVbut I was really not trying to compete with her on this one.
p34
aVAnd in fact, I thought, well,
p35
aVif you have to have cancer,
p36
aVit's pretty convenient to be working
p37
aVat a place that treats it.
p38
aa(lp39
VBut this is what I heard from  a lot of outraged people.
p40
aVWhat?
p41
aVYou're the chaplain.
p42
aVYou should be immune.
p43
aVLike, maybe I should have just gotten off
p44
aVwith a warning instead of an actual ticket,
p45
aVbecause I'm on the force.
p46
aVSo I did get my treatment at the cancer center where I worked,
p47
aVwhich was amazingly convenient,
p48
aVand I had chemotherapy
p49
aVand a mastectomy, and a saline implant put in,
p50
aVand so before I say another word, let me just say right now,
p51
aVthis is the fake one. (Laughter)
p52
aVI have found that I need to get that out of the way,
p53
aVbecause I'll see somebody go
p54
aV"Oh, I know it's this one."
p55
aVAnd then I'll move or I'll  gesture and they'll go,
p56
aV"No, it's that one."
p57
aVSo now you know.
p58
aa(lp59
VI learned a lot being a patient,
p60
aVand one of the surprising things was
p61
aVthat only a small part of the cancer experience
p62
aVis about medicine.
p63
aVMost of it is about feelings and faith
p64
aVand losing and finding your identity
p65
aVand discovering strength
p66
aVand flexibility you never even knew you had.
p67
aVIt's about realizing that
p68
aVthe most important things in life are
p69
aVnot things at all, but relationships,
p70
aVand it's about laughing in the face of uncertainty
p71
aVand learning that the way to get out of almost anything
p72
aVis to say, "I have cancer."
p73
aa(lp74
VSo the other thing I learned was that
p75
aVI don't have to take on "cancer survivor"
p76
aVas my identity,
p77
aVbut, boy, are there powerful forces
p78
aVpushing me to do just that.
p79
aVNow, don't, please, misunderstand me.
p80
aVCancer organizations
p81
aVand the drive for early screening
p82
aVand cancer awareness and cancer research
p83
aVhave normalized cancer,
p84
aVand this is a wonderful thing.
p85
aVWe can now talk about cancer
p86
aVwithout whispering.
p87
aVWe can talk about cancer and we can support one another.
p88
aVBut sometimes, it feels
p89
aVlike people go a little overboard
p90
aVand they start telling us how we're going to feel.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo about a week after my surgery,
p93
aVwe had a houseguest.
p94
aVThat was probably our first mistake.
p95
aVAnd keep in mind that
p96
aVat this point in my life
p97
aVI had been a chaplain for over 20 years,
p98
aVand issues like dying and death
p99
aVand the meaning of life,
p100
aVthese are all things I'd been  yakking about forever.
p101
aVSo at dinner that night,
p102
aVour houseguest proceeds to stretch his arms up over his head,
p103
aVand say, "You know, Deb,
p104
aVnow you're really going to learn what's important.
p105
aVYes, you are going to make some big changes
p106
aVin your life,
p107
aVand now you're going to start thinking about your death.
p108
aVYep, this cancer is your wakeup call."
p109
aVNow, these are golden words
p110
aVcoming from someone who is speaking about
p111
aVtheir own experience,
p112
aVbut when someone is telling you
p113
aVhow you are going to feel,
p114
aVit's instant crap.
p115
aVThe only reason I did not kill him
p116
aVwith my bare hands
p117
aVwas because I could not lift my right arm.
p118
aVBut I did say a really bad word to him,
p119
aVfollowed by a regular word, that \u2014
p120
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p121
aVmade my husband say, "She's on narcotics."
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aVAnd then after my treatment, it just felt like
p124
aVeveryone was telling me what my experience was going to mean.
p125
aV"Oh, this means you're going to be doing the walk."
p126
aV"Oh, this means you're coming to the luncheon."
p127
aV"This means you're going to be wearing
p128
aVthe pink ribbon and the pink t-shirt
p129
aVand the headband and the earrings
p130
aVand the bracelet and the panties."
p131
aVPanties. No, seriously, google it.
p132
aV(Laughter)
p133
aVHow is that raising awareness?
p134
aVOnly my husband should be seeing my panties.
p135
aV(Laughter)
p136
aVHe's pretty aware of cancer already.
p137
aa(lp138
VIt was at that point where I felt like, oh my God,
p139
aVthis is just taking over my life.
p140
aVAnd that's when I told myself,  claim your experience.
p141
aVDon't let it claim you.
p142
aVWe all know that
p143
aVthe way to cope with trauma, with loss,
p144
aVwith any life-changing experience,
p145
aVis to find meaning.
p146
aVBut here's the thing:
p147
aVNo one can tell us
p148
aVwhat our experience means.
p149
aVWe have to decide what it means.
p150
aVAnd it doesn't have to be some gigantic,
p151
aVextroverted meaning.
p152
aVWe don't all have to start a foundation
p153
aVor an organization or write a book
p154
aVor make a documentary.
p155
aVMeaning can be quiet
p156
aVand introverted.
p157
aVMaybe we make one small decision about our lives
p158
aVthat can bring about big change.
p159
aa(lp160
VMany years ago, I had a patient,
p161
aVjust a wonderful young man
p162
aVwho was loved by the staff,
p163
aVand so it was something of a shock to us to realize
p164
aVthat he had no friends.
p165
aVHe lived by himself,
p166
aVhe would come in for chemotherapy by himself,
p167
aVhe would receive his treatment,
p168
aVand then he'd walk home alone.
p169
aVAnd I even asked him. I said, "Hey,
p170
aVhow come you never bring a friend with you?"
p171
aVAnd he said, "I don't really have any friends."
p172
aVBut he had tons of friends on the infusion floor.
p173
aVWe all loved him, and people were going in and out of his room all the time.
p174
aVSo at his last chemo,
p175
aVwe sang him the song
p176
aVand we put the crown on his  head and we blew the bubbles,
p177
aVand then I asked him, I said,
p178
aV"So what are you going to do now?"
p179
aVAnd he answered,
p180
aV"Make friends."
p181
aVAnd he did.
p182
aVHe started volunteering  and he made friends there,
p183
aVand he began going to a church and he made friends there,
p184
aVand at Christmas he invited my husband and me to a party in his apartment,
p185
aVand the place was filled with his friends.
p186
aVClaim your experience.
p187
aVDon't let it claim you.
p188
aVHe decided that the meaning of his experience
p189
aVwas to know the joy of friendship,
p190
aVand then learn to make friends.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo what about you?
p193
aVHow are you going to find meaning
p194
aVin your crappy experience?
p195
aVIt could be a recent one,
p196
aVor it could be one that you've been carrying around
p197
aVfor a really long time.
p198
aVIt's never too late to change what it means,
p199
aVbecause meaning is dynamic.
p200
aVWhat it means today
p201
aVmay not be what it means a year from now,
p202
aVor 10 years from now.
p203
aVIt's never too late to become someone other
p204
aVthan simply a survivor.
p205
aVHear how static that word sounds?
p206
aVSurvivor.
p207
aVNo movement, no growth.
p208
aVClaim your experience.
p209
aVDon't let it claim you, because if you do,
p210
aVI believe you will become trapped,
p211
aVyou will not grow, you will not evolve.
p212
aa(lp213
VBut of course, sometimes it's not outside pressures
p214
aVthat cause us to take on that identity of survivor.
p215
aVSometimes we just like the perks.
p216
aVSometimes there's a payoff.
p217
aVBut then we get stuck.
p218
aVNow, one of the first things I learned
p219
aVas a chaplain intern was the three C's
p220
aVof the chaplain's job:
p221
aVComfort, clarify and, when necessary, confront
p222
aVor challenge.
p223
aVNow, we all pretty much love the comforting
p224
aVand the clarifying.
p225
aVThe confronting, not so much.
p226
aa(lp227
VOne of the other things that I loved
p228
aVabout being a chaplain was
p229
aVseeing patients a year, or even several years
p230
aVafter their treatment, because
p231
aVit was just really cool to see  how they had changed
p232
aVand how their lives had evolved
p233
aVand what had happened to them.
p234
aVSo I was thrilled one day
p235
aVto get a page down into the lobby of the clinic
p236
aVfrom a patient who I had seen the year before,
p237
aVand she was there with her two adult daughters,
p238
aVwho I also knew, for her one year follow-up exam.
p239
aVSo I got down to the lobby, and they were ecstatic
p240
aVbecause she had just gotten all of her test results back
p241
aVand she was NED: No Evidence of Disease.
p242
aVWhich I used to think meant Not Entirely Dead.
p243
aVSo they were ecstatic, we sat down to visit,
p244
aVand it was so weird, because
p245
aVwithin two minutes, she  started retelling me the story
p246
aVof her diagnosis and her  surgery and her chemo,
p247
aVeven though, as her chaplain,  I saw her every week,
p248
aVand so I knew this story.
p249
aVAnd she was using words like suffering,
p250
aVagony, struggle.
p251
aVAnd she ended her story with,
p252
aV"I felt crucified."
p253
aVAnd at that point, her two  daughters got up and said,
p254
aV"We're going to go get coffee."
p255
aVAnd they left.
p256
aVTell me three things about yourself before the next stop.
p257
aVPeople were leaving the bus before she even got
p258
aVto number two or number three.
p259
aVSo I handed her a tissue,
p260
aVand I gave her a hug,
p261
aVand then, because I really cared for this woman,
p262
aVI said,
p263
aV"Get down off your cross."
p264
aVAnd she said, "What?"
p265
aVAnd I repeated, "Get down off your cross."
p266
aVAnd to her credit, she could  talk about her reasons
p267
aVfor embracing and then clinging to this identity.
p268
aVIt got her a lot of attention.
p269
aVPeople were taking care of her for a change.
p270
aVBut now, it was having the opposite effect.
p271
aVIt was pushing people away.
p272
aVPeople kept leaving to get coffee.
p273
aVShe felt crucified by her experience,
p274
aVbut she didn't want to let that crucified self die.
p275
aVNow, perhaps you are thinking
p276
aVI was a little harsh with her,
p277
aVso I must tell you that
p278
aVI was speaking out of my own experience.
p279
aVMany, many years before,
p280
aVI had been fired from a job that I loved,
p281
aVand I would not stop talking about my innocence
p282
aVand the injustice and the betrayal and the deceipt,
p283
aVuntil finally, just like this woman,
p284
aVpeople were walking away from me,
p285
aVuntil I finally realized
p286
aVI wasn't just processing my feelings,
p287
aVI was feeding them.
p288
aVI didn't want to let that crucified self die.
p289
aVBut we all know that with any resurrection story,
p290
aVyou have to die first.
p291
aVThe Christian story,
p292
aVJesus was dead a whole day in the tomb
p293
aVbefore he was resurrected.
p294
aVAnd I believe that for us,
p295
aVbeing in the tomb
p296
aVmeans doing our own deep inner work
p297
aVaround our wounds
p298
aVand allowing ourselves to be healed.
p299
aVWe have to let that crucified self die
p300
aVso that a new self, a truer self,
p301
aVis born.
p302
aVWe have to let that old story go
p303
aVso that a new story, a truer story,
p304
aVcan be told.
p305
aVClaim your experience. Don't let it claim you.
p306
aa(lp307
VWhat if there were no survivors,
p308
aVmeaning, what if people decided
p309
aVto just claim their trauma as an experience
p310
aVinstead of taking it on as an identity?
p311
aVMaybe it would be the end of being
p312
aVtrapped in our wounds
p313
aVand the beginning of amazing
p314
aVself-exploration and discovery and growth.
p315
aVMaybe it would be the start of defining ourselves
p316
aVby who we have become
p317
aVand who we are becoming.
p318
aa(lp319
VSo perhaps survivor was not
p320
aVone of the three things that you would tell me.
p321
aVNo matter.
p322
aVI just want you all to know that
p323
aVI am really glad that we are on this bus together,
p324
aVand this is my stop.
p325
