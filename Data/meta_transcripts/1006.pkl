VDo you ever feel completely overwhelmed
p4
aVwhen you're faced with a complex problem?
p5
aVWell, I hope to change that in less than three minutes.
p6
aVSo, I hope to convince you that complex
p7
aVdoesn't always equal complicated.
p8
aVSo for me, a well-crafted baguette, fresh out of the oven,
p9
aVis complex,
p10
aVbut a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread
p11
aVis complicated.
p12
aVI'm an ecologist, and I study complexity. I love complexity.
p13
aVAnd I study that in the natural world, the interconnectedness of species.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo here's a food web,
p16
aVor a map of feeding links between species
p17
aVthat live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California.
p18
aVAnd this is what happens to that food web
p19
aVwhen it's stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before.
p20
aVAll the grayed-out species disappear.
p21
aVSome are actually on the brink of extinction.
p22
aVAnd lakes with fish have more mosquitos, even though they eat them.
p23
aVThese effects were all unanticipated,
p24
aVand yet we're discovering they're predictable.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo I want to share with you a couple key insights
p27
aVabout complexity we're learning from studying nature
p28
aVthat maybe are applicable to other problems.
p29
aVFirst is the simple power of good visualization tools
p30
aVto help untangle complexity
p31
aVand just encourage you to ask questions you didn't think of before.
p32
aVFor example, you could plot the flow of carbon
p33
aVthrough corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem,
p34
aVor the interconnections of habitat patches
p35
aVfor endangered species in Yosemite National Park.
p36
aVThe next thing is that if you want to predict
p37
aVthe effect of one species on another,
p38
aVif you focus only on that link,
p39
aVand then you black box the rest,
p40
aVit's actually less predictable
p41
aVthan if you step back, consider the entire system \u2014 all the species, all the links \u2014
p42
aVand from that place,
p43
aVhone in on the sphere of influence that matters most.
p44
aVAnd we're discovering, with our research,
p45
aVthat's often very local to the node you care about
p46
aVwithin one or two degrees.
p47
aVSo the more you step back, embrace complexity,
p48
aVthe better chance you have of finding simple answers,
p49
aVand it's often different than the simple answer that you started with.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo let's switch gears and look at a really complex problem
p52
aVcourtesy of the U.S. government.
p53
aVThis is a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan.
p54
aVIt was front page of the New York Times a couple months ago.
p55
aVInstantly ridiculed by the media
p56
aVfor being so crazy complicated.
p57
aVAnd the stated goal was to increase popular support
p58
aVfor the Afghan government.
p59
aVClearly a complex problem,
p60
aVbut is it complicated?
p61
aVWell, when I saw this in the front page of the Times,
p62
aVI thought, "Great. Finally something I can relate to.
p63
aVI can sink my teeth into this."
p64
aa(lp65
VSo let's do it. So here we go for the first time ever,
p66
aVa world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network.
p67
aVThe circled node is the one we're trying to influence \u2014
p68
aVpopular support for the government.
p69
aVAnd so now we can look one degrees, two degrees,
p70
aVthree degrees away from that node
p71
aVand eliminate three-quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence.
p72
aVWithin that sphere,
p73
aVmost of those nodes are not actionable, like the harshness of the terrain,
p74
aVand a very small minority are actual military actions.
p75
aVMost are non-violent and they fall into two broad categories:
p76
aVactive engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs
p77
aVand fair, transparent economic development
p78
aVand provisioning of services.
p79
aVI don't know about this, but this is what I can decipher from this diagram
p80
aVin 24 seconds.
p81
aa(lp82
VWhen you see a diagram like this, I don't want you to be afraid.
p83
aVI want you to be excited. I want you to be relieved.
p84
aVBecause simple answers may emerge.
p85
aVWe're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies
p86
aVon the other side of complexity.
p87
aVSo for any problem, the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity,
p88
aVthe better chance you have of zooming in
p89
aVon the simple details that matter most.
