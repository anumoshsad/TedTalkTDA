VBacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth.
p4
aVThey've been here for billions of years,
p5
aVand what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms.
p6
aVSo they are one cell and they have this special property
p7
aVthat they only have one piece of DNA.
p8
aVThey have very few genes,
p9
aVand genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out.
p10
aVAnd the way bacteria make a living
p11
aVis that they consume nutrients from the environment,
p12
aVthey grow to twice their size, they cut themselves down in the middle,
p13
aVand one cell becomes two, and so on and so on.
p14
aVThey just grow and divide, and grow and divide \u2014 so a kind of boring life,
p15
aVexcept that what I would argue is that you have
p16
aVan amazing interaction with these critters.
p17
aa(lp18
VI know you guys think of yourself as humans, and this is sort of how I think of you.
p19
aVThis man is supposed to represent
p20
aVa generic human being,
p21
aVand all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body.
p22
aVThere is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us
p23
aVwho we are and able to do all the things that we do,
p24
aVbut you have 10 trillion bacterial cells
p25
aVin you or on you at any moment in your life.
p26
aVSo, 10 times more bacterial cells
p27
aVthan human cells on a human being.
p28
aVAnd of course it's the DNA that counts,
p29
aVso here's all the A, T, Gs and Cs
p30
aVthat make up your genetic code, and give you all your charming characteristics.
p31
aVYou have about 30,000 genes.
p32
aVWell it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes
p33
aVplaying a role in you or on you all of your life.
p34
aVAt the best, you're 10 percent human,
p35
aVbut more likely about one percent human,
p36
aVdepending on which of these metrics you like.
p37
aVI know you think of yourself as human beings,
p38
aVbut I think of you as 90 or 99 percent bacterial.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VThese bacteria are not passive riders,
p43
aVthese are incredibly important, they keep us alive.
p44
aVThey cover us in an invisible body armor
p45
aVthat keeps environmental insults out
p46
aVso that we stay healthy.
p47
aVThey digest our food, they make our vitamins,
p48
aVthey actually educate your immune system
p49
aVto keep bad microbes out.
p50
aVSo they do all these amazing things
p51
aVthat help us and are vital for keeping us alive,
p52
aVand they never get any press for that.
p53
aVBut they get a lot of press because they do a lot of
p54
aVterrible things as well.
p55
aVSo, there's all kinds of bacteria on the Earth
p56
aVthat have no business being in you or on you at any time,
p57
aVand if they are, they make you incredibly sick.
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd so, the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the
p60
aVgood things that bacteria do, or all the bad things that bacteria do.
p61
aVThe question we had is how could they do anything at all?
p62
aVI mean they're incredibly small,
p63
aVyou have to have a microscope to see one.
p64
aVThey live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide,
p65
aVand they've always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms.
p66
aVAnd so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact
p67
aVon the environment
p68
aVif they simply act as individuals.
p69
aVAnd so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different
p70
aVway that bacteria live.
p71
aa(lp72
VThe clue to this came from another marine bacterium,
p73
aVand it's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri.
p74
aVWhat you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab
p75
aVholding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium,
p76
aVa harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean,
p77
aVnamed Vibrio fischeri.
p78
aVThis bacterium has the special property that it makes light,
p79
aVso it makes bioluminescence,
p80
aVlike fireflies make light.
p81
aVWe're not doing anything to the cells here.
p82
aVWe just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room,
p83
aVand this is what we see.
p84
aa(lp85
VWhat was actually interesting to us
p86
aVwas not that the bacteria made light,
p87
aVbut when the bacteria made light.
p88
aVWhat we noticed is when the bacteria were alone,
p89
aVso when they were in dilute suspension, they made no light.
p90
aVBut when they grew to a certain cell number
p91
aVall the bacteria turned on light simultaneously.
p92
aVThe question that we had is how can bacteria, these primitive organisms,
p93
aVtell the difference from times when they're alone,
p94
aVand times when they're in a community,
p95
aVand then all do something together.
p96
aVWhat we've figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other,
p97
aVand they talk with a chemical language.
p98
aa(lp99
VThis is now supposed to be my bacterial cell.
p100
aVWhen it's alone it doesn't make any light.
p101
aVBut what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules
p102
aVthat you can think of like hormones,
p103
aVand these are the red triangles, and when the bacteria is alone
p104
aVthe molecules just float away and so no light.
p105
aVBut when the bacteria grow and double
p106
aVand they're all participating in making these molecules,
p107
aVthe molecule \u2014 the extracellular amount of that molecule
p108
aVincreases in proportion to cell number.
p109
aVAnd when the molecule hits a certain amount
p110
aVthat tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are,
p111
aVthey recognize that molecule
p112
aVand all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony.
p113
aVThat's how bioluminescence works \u2014
p114
aVthey're talking with these chemical words.
p115
aa(lp116
VThe reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology.
p117
aVAgain, another plug for the animals in the ocean,
p118
aVVibrio fischeri lives in this squid.
p119
aVWhat you are looking at is the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid,
p120
aVand it's been turned on its back,
p121
aVand what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes
p122
aVand these house the Vibrio fischeri cells,
p123
aVthey live in there, at high cell number
p124
aVthat molecule is there, and they're making light.
p125
aVThe reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans
p126
aVis because it wants that light.
p127
aVThe way that this symbiosis works
p128
aVis that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii,
p129
aVjust in sort of shallow knee-deep water.
p130
aVThe squid is nocturnal, so during the day
p131
aVit buries itself in the sand and sleeps,
p132
aVbut then at night it has to come out to hunt.
p133
aVOn bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight
p134
aVthat light can penetrate the depth of the water
p135
aVthe squid lives in, since it's just in those couple feet of water.
p136
aVWhat the squid has developed is a shutter
p137
aVthat can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria.
p138
aVThen it has detectors on its back
p139
aVso it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back.
p140
aVAnd it opens and closes the shutter
p141
aVso the amount of light coming out of the bottom \u2014
p142
aVwhich is made by the bacterium \u2014
p143
aVexactly matches how much light hits the squid's back,
p144
aVso the squid doesn't make a shadow.
p145
aVIt actually uses the light from the bacteria
p146
aVto counter-illuminate itself in an anti-predation device
p147
aVso predators can't see its shadow,
p148
aVcalculate its trajectory, and eat it.
p149
aVThis is like the stealth bomber of the ocean.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VBut then if you think about it, the squid has this terrible problem
p154
aVbecause it's got this dying, thick culture of bacteria
p155
aVand it can't sustain that.
p156
aVAnd so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up
p157
aVthe squid goes back to sleep, it buries itself in the sand,
p158
aVand it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm,
p159
aVand when the sun comes up it pumps out like 95 percent of the bacteria.
p160
aVNow the bacteria are dilute, that little hormone molecule is gone,
p161
aVso they're not making light \u2014
p162
aVbut of course the squid doesn't care. It's asleep in the sand.
p163
aVAnd as the day goes by the bacteria double,
p164
aVthey release the molecule, and then light comes on
p165
aVat night, exactly when the squid wants it.
p166
aa(lp167
VFirst we figured out how this bacterium does this,
p168
aVbut then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this
p169
aVto figure out really what's the mechanism.
p170
aVAnd what we found \u2014 so this is now supposed to be, again, my bacterial cell \u2014
p171
aVis that Vibrio fischeri has a protein \u2014
p172
aVthat's the red box \u2014 it's an enzyme that makes
p173
aVthat little hormone molecule, the red triangle.
p174
aVAnd then as the cells grow, they're all releasing that molecule
p175
aVinto the environment, so there's lots of molecule there.
p176
aVAnd the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface
p177
aVthat fits like a lock and key with that molecule.
p178
aVThese are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells.
p179
aVWhen the molecule increases to a certain amount \u2014
p180
aVwhich says something about the number of cells \u2014
p181
aVit locks down into that receptor
p182
aVand information comes into the cells
p183
aVthat tells the cells to turn on
p184
aVthis collective behavior of making light.
p185
aa(lp186
VWhy this is interesting is because in the past decade
p187
aVwe have found that this is not just some anomaly
p188
aVof this ridiculous, glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean \u2014
p189
aVall bacteria have systems like this.
p190
aVSo now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other.
p191
aVThey make chemical words, they recognize those words,
p192
aVand they turn on group behaviors
p193
aVthat are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison.
p194
aVWe have a fancy name for this: we call it quorum sensing.
p195
aVThey vote with these chemical votes,
p196
aVthe vote gets counted, and then everybody responds to the vote.
p197
aa(lp198
VWhat's important for today's talk
p199
aVis that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors
p200
aVthat bacteria carry out in these collective fashions.
p201
aVBut the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence.
p202
aVIt's not like a couple bacteria get in you
p203
aVand they start secreting some toxins \u2014
p204
aVyou're enormous, that would have no effect on you. You're huge.
p205
aVWhat they do, we now understand,
p206
aVis they get in you, they wait, they start growing,
p207
aVthey count themselves with these little molecules,
p208
aVand they recognize when they have the right cell number
p209
aVthat if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together,
p210
aVthey are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host.
p211
aVBacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing.
p212
aVThat's how it works.
p213
aa(lp214
VWe also then went to look at what are these molecules \u2014
p215
aVthese were the red triangles on my slides before.
p216
aVThis is the Vibrio fischeri molecule.
p217
aVThis is the word that it talks with.
p218
aVSo then we started to look at other bacteria,
p219
aVand these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered.
p220
aVWhat I hope you can see
p221
aVis that the molecules are related.
p222
aVThe left-hand part of the molecule is identical
p223
aVin every single species of bacteria.
p224
aVBut the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species.
p225
aVWhat that does is to confer
p226
aVexquisite species specificities to these languages.
p227
aVEach molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other.
p228
aVSo these are private, secret conversations.
p229
aVThese conversations are for intraspecies communication.
p230
aVEach bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language
p231
aVthat allows it to count its own siblings.
p232
aa(lp233
VOnce we got that far we thought
p234
aVwe were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors.
p235
aVBut what we were really thinking about is that most of the time
p236
aVbacteria don't live by themselves, they live in incredible mixtures,
p237
aVwith hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria.
p238
aVAnd that's depicted on this slide. This is your skin.
p239
aVSo this is just a picture \u2014 a micrograph of your skin.
p240
aVAnywhere on your body, it looks pretty much like this,
p241
aVand what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there.
p242
aVAnd so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria,
p243
aVand it's about counting your neighbors,
p244
aVit's not enough to be able to only talk within your species.
p245
aVThere has to be a way to take a census
p246
aVof the rest of the bacteria in the population.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo we went back to molecular biology
p249
aVand started studying different bacteria,
p250
aVand what we've found now is that
p251
aVin fact, bacteria are multilingual.
p252
aVThey all have a species-specific system \u2014
p253
aVthey have a molecule that says "me."
p254
aVBut then, running in parallel to that is a second system
p255
aVthat we've discovered, that's generic.
p256
aVSo, they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal
p257
aVand it has its own receptor,
p258
aVand this molecule is the trade language of bacteria.
p259
aVIt's used by all different bacteria
p260
aVand it's the language of interspecies communication.
p261
aVWhat happens is that bacteria are able to count
p262
aVhow many of me and how many of you.
p263
aVThey take that information inside,
p264
aVand they decide what tasks to carry out
p265
aVdepending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority
p266
aVof any given population.
p267
aa(lp268
VThen again we turn to chemistry,
p269
aVand we figured out what this generic molecule is \u2014
p270
aVthat was the pink ovals on my last slide, this is it.
p271
aVIt's a very small, five-carbon molecule.
p272
aVWhat the important thing is that we learned
p273
aVis that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme
p274
aVand makes exactly the same molecule.
p275
aVSo they're all using this molecule
p276
aVfor interspecies communication.
p277
aVThis is the bacterial Esperanto.
p278
aa(lp279
V(Laughter)
p280
aa(lp281
VOnce we got that far, we started to learn
p282
aVthat bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language.
p283
aVBut what we started to think is that maybe there is something
p284
aVpractical that we can do here as well.
p285
aVI've told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors,
p286
aVthey communicate with these molecules.
p287
aVOf course, I've also told you that one of the important things they do
p288
aVis to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing.
p289
aVWe thought, what if we made these bacteria
p290
aVso they can't talk or they can't hear?
p291
aVCouldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics?
p292
aa(lp293
VOf course, you've just heard and you already know
p294
aVthat we're running out of antibiotics.
p295
aVBacteria are incredibly multi-drug-resistant right now,
p296
aVand that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria.
p297
aVThey either pop the bacterial membrane,
p298
aVthey make the bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA.
p299
aVWe kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics
p300
aVand that selects for resistant mutants.
p301
aVAnd so now of course we have this global problem
p302
aVin infectious diseases.
p303
aVWe thought, well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications,
p304
aVjust make these bacteria so they can't talk, they can't count,
p305
aVand they don't know to launch virulence.
p306
aa(lp307
VAnd so that's exactly what we've done, and we've sort of taken two strategies.
p308
aVThe first one is we've targeted
p309
aVthe intraspecies communication system.
p310
aVSo we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules \u2014
p311
aVwhich you saw \u2014 but they're a little bit different.
p312
aVAnd so they lock into those receptors,
p313
aVand they jam recognition of the real thing.
p314
aVBy targeting the red system,
p315
aVwhat we are able to do is to make
p316
aVspecies-specific, or disease-specific, anti-quorum sensing molecules.
p317
aVWe've also done the same thing with the pink system.
p318
aVWe've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit
p319
aVso that we've made antagonists
p320
aVof the interspecies communication system.
p321
aVThe hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics
p322
aVthat work against all bacteria.
p323
aa(lp324
VTo finish I'll just show you the strategy.
p325
aVIn this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule,
p326
aVbut the logic is exactly the same.
p327
aVWhat you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal,
p328
aVin this case, a mouse,
p329
aVit doesn't initiate virulence right away.
p330
aVIt gets in, it starts growing, it starts secreting
p331
aVits quorum sensing molecules.
p332
aVIt recognizes when it has enough bacteria
p333
aVthat now they're going to launch their attack,
p334
aVand the animal dies.
p335
aVWhat we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections,
p336
aVbut we give them in conjunction with our anti-quorum sensing molecules \u2014
p337
aVso these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing,
p338
aVbut they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide.
p339
aVWhat we now know is that if we treat the animal
p340
aVwith a pathogenic bacterium \u2014 a multi-drug-resistant pathogenic bacterium \u2014
p341
aVin the same time we give our anti-quorum sensing molecule,
p342
aVin fact, the animal lives.
p343
aa(lp344
VWe think that this is the next generation of antibiotics
p345
aVand it's going to get us around, at least initially,
p346
aVthis big problem of resistance.
p347
aVWhat I hope you think, is that bacteria can talk to each other,
p348
aVthey use chemicals as their words,
p349
aVthey have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon
p350
aVthat we're just now starting to learn about.
p351
aVOf course what that allows bacteria to do
p352
aVis to be multicellular.
p353
aVSo in the spirit of TED they're doing things together
p354
aVbecause it makes a difference.
p355
aVWhat happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors,
p356
aVand they can carry out tasks
p357
aVthat they could never accomplish
p358
aVif they simply acted as individuals.
p359
aa(lp360
VWhat I would hope that I could further argue to you
p361
aVis that this is the invention of multicellularity.
p362
aVBacteria have been on the Earth for billions of years;
p363
aVhumans, couple hundred thousand.
p364
aVWe think bacteria made the rules
p365
aVfor how multicellular organization works.
p366
aVWe think, by studying bacteria,
p367
aVwe're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body.
p368
aVWe know that the principles and the rules,
p369
aVif we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms,
p370
aVthe hope is that they will be applied
p371
aVto other human diseases and human behaviors as well.
p372
aVI hope that what you've learned
p373
aVis that bacteria can distinguish self from other.
p374
aVBy using these two molecules they can say "me" and they can say "you."
p375
aVAgain of course that's what we do,
p376
aVboth in a molecular way,
p377
aVand also in an outward way,
p378
aVbut I think about the molecular stuff.
p379
aa(lp380
VThis is exactly what happens in your body.
p381
aVIt's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day,
p382
aVand that's because there's all of this chemistry going on,
p383
aVthese molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is,
p384
aVand what their tasks should be.
p385
aVAgain, we think that bacteria invented that,
p386
aVand you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles,
p387
aVbut all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study.
p388
aa(lp389
VThe final thing is, again just to reiterate that there's this practical part,
p390
aVand so we've made these anti-quorum sensing molecules
p391
aVthat are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics.
p392
aVBut then, to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria
p393
aVthat live on the Earth,
p394
aVwe've also made pro-quorum sensing molecules.
p395
aVSo, we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better.
p396
aVRemember you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells
p397
aVin you or on you, keeping you healthy.
p398
aVWhat we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation
p399
aVof the bacteria that live as mutualists with you,
p400
aVin the hopes of making you more healthy,
p401
aVmaking those conversations better,
p402
aVso bacteria can do things that we want them to do
p403
aVbetter than they would be on their own.
p404
aa(lp405
VFinally, I wanted to show you
p406
aVthis is my gang at Princeton, New Jersey.
p407
aVEverything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture.
p408
aVI hope when you learn things,
p409
aVlike about how the natural world works \u2014
p410
aVI just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper
p411
aVor you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world
p412
aVit was done by a child.
p413
aVScience is done by that demographic.
p414
aVAll of those people are between 20 and 30 years old,
p415
aVand they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country.
p416
aVIt's a really lucky demographic to work with.
p417
aVI keep getting older and older and they're always the same age,
p418
aVand it's just a crazy delightful job.
p419
aVI want to thank you for inviting me here.
p420
aVIt's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference.
p421
aa(lp422
V(Applause)
p423
aa(lp424
VThanks.
p425
