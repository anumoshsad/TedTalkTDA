VLet's say you despise
p4
aVWestern democracy.
p5
aVDemocracy, in all its trappings,
p6
aVfree elections, town halls,
p7
aVendless debates about the proper role of government.
p8
aVToo messy,
p9
aVtoo unpredictable,
p10
aVtoo constraining for your taste.
p11
aVAnd the way these democracies band together and lecture everyone else
p12
aVabout individual rights and freedoms \u2014
p13
aVit gets under your skin.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo what to do about it?
p16
aVYou can call out the hypocrisy and failures of Western democracies
p17
aVand explain how your way is better,
p18
aVbut that's never really worked for you.
p19
aVWhat if you could get the people
p20
aVwhose support is the very foundation of these democracies
p21
aVto start questioning the system?
p22
aVMake the idea occur in their own minds
p23
aVthat democracy and its institutions are failing them,
p24
aVtheir elite are corrupt puppet masters
p25
aVand the country they knew is in free fall.
p26
aVTo do that,
p27
aVyou'll need to infiltrate the information spheres
p28
aVof these democracies.
p29
aVYou'll need to turn their most powerful asset \u2014
p30
aVan open mind \u2014
p31
aVinto their greatest vulnerability.
p32
aVYou'll need people to question the truth.
p33
aa(lp34
VNow, you'll be familiar of hacking and leaks that happened in 2016.
p35
aVOne was the Democratic National Committee's networks,
p36
aVand the personal email accounts of its staff,
p37
aVlater released on WikiLeaks.
p38
aVAfter that, various online personas,
p39
aVlike a supposed Romanian cybercriminal who didn't speak Romanian,
p40
aVaggressively pushed news of these leaks to journalists.
p41
aVThe media took the bait.
p42
aVThey were consumed by how much the DNC hated Bernie.
p43
aVAt the time, it was that narrative that far outshined the news
p44
aVthat a group of Russian government sponsored hackers
p45
aVwho we called "Advanced Persistent Threat 28,"
p46
aVor "APT28" for short,
p47
aVwas carrying out these operations against the US.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd there was no shortage of evidence.
p50
aVThis group of Russian government hackers hadn't just appeared out of nowhere
p51
aVin 2016.
p52
aVWe had started tracking this group back in 2014.
p53
aVAnd the tools that APT28 used to compromise its victims' networks
p54
aVdemonstrated a thoughtful, well-resourced effort
p55
aVthat had taken place for now over a decade
p56
aVin Moscow's time zone
p57
aVfrom about 9 am to 6 pm.
p58
aVAPT28 loved to prey on the emails and contacts of journalists in Chechnya,
p59
aVthe Georgian government, eastern European defense attachés \u2014
p60
aVall targets with an undeniable interest to the Russian government.
p61
aa(lp62
VWe weren't the only ones onto this.
p63
aVGovernments, research teams across the world,
p64
aVwere coming to similar conclusions
p65
aVand observing the same types of operations.
p66
aVBut what Russia was doing in 2016
p67
aVwent far beyond espionage.
p68
aVThe DNC hack was just one of many where stolen data was posted online
p69
aVaccompanied by a sensational narrative,
p70
aVthen amplified in social media
p71
aVfor lightning-speed adoption by the media.
p72
aVThis didn't ring the alarm bells
p73
aVthat a nation-state was trying to interfere with the credibility
p74
aVof another's internal affairs.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo why, collectively, did we not see this coming?
p77
aVWhy did it take months before Americans understood
p78
aVthat they were under a state-sponsored information attack?
p79
aVThe easy answer is politics.
p80
aVThe Obama Administration was caught in a perfect catch-22.
p81
aVBy raising the specter that the Russian government was interfering
p82
aVin the US presidential campaign,
p83
aVthe Administration risked appearing to meddle in the campaign itself.
p84
aVBut the better answer, I think,
p85
aVis that the US and the West were utterly unequipped
p86
aVto recognize and respond to a modern information operation,
p87
aVdespite the fact that the US had wielded information
p88
aVwith devastating success in an era not so long ago.
p89
aa(lp90
VLook, so while the US and the West spent the last 20 years
p91
aVcaught up in cybersecurity \u2014
p92
aVwhat networks to harden,
p93
aVwhich infrastructure to deem critical,
p94
aVhow to set up armies of cyber warriors and cyber commands \u2014
p95
aVRussia was thinking in far more consequential terms.
p96
aVBefore the first iPhone even hit the shelf,
p97
aVthe Russian government understood the risks and the opportunity
p98
aVthat technology provided
p99
aVand the inter-communication and instant communication it provided us.
p100
aa(lp101
VAs our realities are increasingly based on the information
p102
aVthat we're consuming at the palm of our hand
p103
aVand from the news feeds that we're scanning
p104
aVand the hashtags and stories that we see trending,
p105
aVthe Russian government was the first to recognize
p106
aVhow this evolution
p107
aVhad turned your mind into the most exploitable device on the planet.
p108
aVAnd your mind is particularly exploitable
p109
aVif you're accustomed to an unfettered flow of information,
p110
aVnow increasingly curated to your own tastes.
p111
aVThis panorama of information that's so interesting to you
p112
aVgives a state, or anyone for that matter, a perfect back door into your mind.
p113
aa(lp114
VIt's this new brand of state-sponsored information operations
p115
aVthat can be that much more successful,
p116
aVmore insidious,
p117
aVand harder for the target audience \u2014 that includes the media \u2014
p118
aVto decipher and characterize.
p119
aVIf you can get a hashtag trending on Twitter,
p120
aVor chum the waters with fake news
p121
aVdirected to audiences primed to receive it,
p122
aVor drive journalists to dissect terabytes of email
p123
aVfor a cent of impropriety \u2014
p124
aVall tactics used in Russian operations \u2014
p125
aVthen you've got a shot at effectively camouflaging your operations
p126
aVin the mind of your target.
p127
aVThis is what Russia's long called "reflexive control."
p128
aVIt's the ability to use information on someone else
p129
aVso that they make a decision
p130
aVon their own accord
p131
aVthat's favorable to you.
p132
aVThis is nation-state-grade image control and perception management,
p133
aVand it's conducted by any means,
p134
aVwith any tools, network-based or otherwise, that will achieve it.
p135
aa(lp136
VTake this for another example.
p137
aVIn early February 2014, a few weeks before Russia would invade Crimea,
p138
aVa phone call is posted on YouTube.
p139
aVIn it, there's two US diplomats.
p140
aVThey sound like they're playing kingmaker in Ukraine,
p141
aVand worse, they curse the EU for its lack of speed and leadership
p142
aVin resolving the crisis.
p143
aVThe media covers the phone call,
p144
aVand then the ensuing diplomatic backlash
p145
aVleaves Washington and Europe reeling.
p146
aVAnd it creates a fissured response and a feckless attitude
p147
aVtowards Russia's land grab in Ukraine.
p148
aVMission accomplished.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo while hacked phone calls and emails and networks
p151
aVkeep grabbing the headlines,
p152
aVthe real operations are the ones
p153
aVthat are influencing the decisions you make
p154
aVand the opinions you hold,
p155
aVall in the service of a nation-state's strategic interest.
p156
aVThis is power in the information age.
p157
aVAnd this information is all that much more seductive,
p158
aVall that much easier to take at face value and pass on,
p159
aVwhen it's authentic.
p160
aVWho's not interested in the truth that's presented in phone calls and emails
p161
aVthat were never intended for public consumption?
p162
aVBut how meaningful is that truth
p163
aVif you don't know why it's being revealed to you?
p164
aa(lp165
VWe must recognize that this place where we're increasingly living,
p166
aVwhich we've quaintly termed "cyberspace,"
p167
aVisn't defined by ones and zeroes,
p168
aVbut by information and the people behind it.
p169
aVThis is far more than a network of computers and devices.
p170
aVThis is a network composed of minds
p171
aVinteracting with computers and devices.
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd for this network,
p174
aVthere's no encryption, there's no firewall,
p175
aVno two-factor authentication,
p176
aVno password complex enough to protect you.
p177
aVWhat you have for defense
p178
aVis far stronger, it's more adaptable, it's always running the latest version.
p179
aVIt's the ability to think critically:
p180
aVcall out falsehood,
p181
aVpress for the facts.
p182
aVAnd above all, you must have the courage
p183
aVto unflinchingly pursue the truth.
