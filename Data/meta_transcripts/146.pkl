VI've always wanted to be a cyborg.
p4
aVOne of my favorite shows as a kid was "The Six Million Dollar Man,"
p5
aVand this is a little bit closer to the 240-dollar man or so, but \u2014
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VAt any rate, I would normally feel very self-conscious and geeky
p10
aVwearing this around,
p11
aVbut a few days ago I saw one world-renowned statistician
p12
aVswallowing swords on stage here,
p13
aVso I figure it's OK amongst this group.
p14
aVBut that's not what I want to talk about today.
p15
aVI want to talk about toys, and the power that I see inherent in them.
p16
aa(lp17
VWhen I was a kid, I attended Montessori school
p18
aVup to sixth grade in Atlanta, Georgia.
p19
aVAnd at the time I didn't think much about it,
p20
aVbut then later, I realized that that was the high point of my education.
p21
aVFrom that point on, everything else was pretty much downhill.
p22
aVAnd it wasn't until later, as I started making games, that \u2014
p23
aVI really actually think of them more as toys.
p24
aVPeople call me a game designer,
p25
aVbut I really think of these things more as toys.
p26
aVI started getting very interested in Maria Montessori and her methods,
p27
aVand the way she went about things,
p28
aVand the way she thought it very valuable for kids
p29
aVto discover things on their own
p30
aVrather than being taught these things overtly.
p31
aVAnd she would design these toys, where kids in playing with the toys
p32
aVwould come to understand these deep principles
p33
aVof life and nature through play.
p34
aVAnd since they discovered this, it stuck with them so much more,
p35
aVand also they would experience their own failures.
p36
aVThere was a failure-based aspect to learning there. It was very important.
p37
aVAnd so, the games that I do,
p38
aVI think of really more as modern Montessori toys.
p39
aVAnd I really kind of want them to be presented in a way
p40
aVto where kids can kind of explore and discover their own principles.
p41
aVSo a few years ago,
p42
aa(lp43
VI started getting very interested in the SETI program.
p44
aVAnd that's the way I work.
p45
aVI get interested in different subjects, I dive in, research them,
p46
aVand then try to figure out how to craft a toy around that,
p47
aVso that other people can experience the same sense of discovery
p48
aVthat I did as I was learning that subject.
p49
aVAnd it led me to astrobiology,
p50
aVthe study of possible life in the universe.
p51
aVAnd then Drake's equation,
p52
aVlooking at the probability of life arising on planets,
p53
aVhow long it might last, how many planets are out there.
p54
aVAnd I started looking at how interesting Drake's equation was,
p55
aVbecause it spanned all these different subjects \u2014
p56
aVphysics, chemistry, sociology, economics, astronomy.
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd another thing that really impressed me a long time ago
p59
aVwas "Powers of Ten," Charles and Ray Eames' film.
p60
aVAnd I started putting those two together and wondering, could I build a toy
p61
aVwhere kids would trip across all these interesting principles of life,
p62
aVas it exists and as it might go in the future.
p63
aVThings where you might trip across things
p64
aVlike the Copernican principle, the Fermi paradox,
p65
aVthe anthropic principle, the origin of life.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd so I'm going to show you a toy today that I've been working on,
p68
aVthat I think of more as kind of a philosophy toy.
p69
aVPlaying this toy will bring up philosophical questions in you.
p70
aa(lp71
VThe game is "Spore." I've been working on it for several years.
p72
aVIt's getting pretty close to finished now.
p73
aVIt occurs at all these different scales, from very small to very large.
p74
aVI'm going to pop in at the start of the game.
p75
aVAnd you actually start this game in a drop of water,
p76
aVas a very, very small single-cell creature,
p77
aVand right off the bat you basically just have to live, survive, reproduce.
p78
aVSo here we are, at a very microscopic scale,
p79
aVswimming around.
p80
aVAnd I actually realize that cells don't have eyes,
p81
aVbut it helps to make it cute.
p82
aa(lp83
VThe players are going to play through every generation of this species,
p84
aVand as you play the game,
p85
aVthe creature is actually growing bit by bit.
p86
aVAnd as we start growing,
p87
aVthe camera will actually start zooming out,
p88
aVand things that you see in the background there
p89
aVwill start slowly pulling into the foreground,
p90
aVshowing you a little bit of what you'll be interacting with as you grow.
p91
aVSo as we eat, the camera starts pulling out,
p92
aVand then we start interacting with larger and larger organisms.
p93
aa(lp94
VWe actually play through many generations here,
p95
aVat the cellular scale.
p96
aVI'm going to skip ahead here.
p97
aVAt some point we get larger,
p98
aVand we actually get to a macroevolution scale.
p99
aVNow, at this point we're leaving the water,
p100
aVand one thing that's kind of important about this game is that, at every level,
p101
aVthe player is designing their creature,
p102
aVand that's a fundamental aspect of this.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow, in the evolution game here, the creature scale,
p105
aVbasically you have to eat, survive, and then reproduce.
p106
aVYou know, very Darwinian.
p107
aVOne thing we noticed with "The Sims," a game I did earlier,
p108
aVis that players love making stuff.
p109
aVWhen they were able to make stuff in the game,
p110
aVthey had a lot of empathy in connection to it.
p111
aVEven if it wasn't as pretty
p112
aVas a professional artist would make for games,
p113
aVit really stuck with them
p114
aVand they really cared about what would happen to it.
p115
aa(lp116
VAt this point, we've left the water, and now with this little creature \u2014
p117
aVwe could bring up the volume a little bit \u2014
p118
aVand now we might try to eat.
p119
aVWe might sneak up on this little guy over here maybe,
p120
aVand try and eat him.
p121
aVOK, well, we fight.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Creatures grunting)
p124
aa(lp125
VOK, we got him.
p126
aVNow we get a meal.
p127
aVSo really, at this part of the game,
p128
aVwhat we're doing is we're running around and surviving,
p129
aVand also getting to the next generation,
p130
aVbecause we're going to play through every generation of this creature.
p131
aVWe can mate, so I'm going to see
p132
aVif one of these creatures wants to mate with me. Yeah.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Creatures grunting)
p135
aa(lp136
VWe didn't want to replay actual evolution with humans and all that,
p137
aVbecause it's almost more interesting
p138
aVto look at alternate possibilities in evolution.
p139
aVEvolution is usually presented as this one path that we took through,
p140
aVbut really it represents this huge set of possibilities.
p141
aVNow, once we mate, we click on the egg.
p142
aVAnd this is where the game starts getting interesting,
p143
aVbecause one of the things we really focused on here
p144
aVwas giving the players very high-leverage tools,
p145
aVso that for very little effort, the player can make something very cool.
p146
aVAnd it involves a lot of intelligence on the tool side.
p147
aa(lp148
VBut basically, this is the editor
p149
aVwhere we're going to design the next generation.
p150
aVSo it has a little spine. I can move around, I can extend.
p151
aVI can also inflate or deflate it with the mouse wheel,
p152
aVso you sculpt it like clay.
p153
aVWe have parts here that I can put on or pull off.
p154
aVThe idea is that the player can basically design
p155
aVanything they can think of in this editor,
p156
aVand we'll basically bring it to life.
p157
aVSo I might put some limbs on the character here.
p158
aVI'll inflate them kind of large.
p159
aVAnd in this case I might decide I'm going to put \u2014
p160
aVI'll put mouths on the limbs.
p161
aa(lp162
VSo pretty much players are encouraged to be very creative in the game.
p163
aVHere, I'll give it one eye in the middle, maybe scale it up a bit. Point it down.
p164
aVAnd I'll also give it a few legs.
p165
aVSo in some sense
p166
aVwe want this to feel like an amplifier for the player's imagination,
p167
aVso that with a very small number of clicks a player can create something
p168
aVthat they didn't really think was possible before.
p169
aVThis is almost like designing something like Maya \u2014
p170
aVthat an eight-year-old can use.
p171
aVBut really the goal here was,
p172
aVwithin about a minute, I wanted somebody to replicate
p173
aVwhat typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create.
p174
aVOK, now I'll put some hands on it.
p175
aVOK, so here I've basically thrown together a little creature.
p176
aVLet me give it a little weapon on the tail here, so it can fight.
p177
aVOK, so that's the complete model.
p178
aVNow we can actually go to the painting phase.
p179
aa(lp180
VAt this phase, the program has some understanding
p181
aVof the topology of this creature.
p182
aVIt knows where the backbone is, where the spine, the limbs are,
p183
aVhow stripes should run, how it should be shaded.
p184
aVAnd so we're procedurally generating the texture map,
p185
aVsomething a texture artist would take many days to work on.
p186
aVAnd then we can test it out, and see how it would move around.
p187
aVAnd so at this point the computer is procedurally animating this creature.
p188
aVIt's looking at whatever I've designed. It will actually bring it to life.
p189
aVAnd I can see how it might dance.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VHow it might show emotions, how it might fight.
p194
aVSo it's acting with its two mouths there.
p195
aVI can even have it pose for a photo.
p196
aVSnap a little photo of it.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VSo then I bring this back into the game.
p201
aVIt's born, and I play the next generation of my creature through evolution.
p202
aVNow again, the empathy that the players have
p203
aVwhen they create the content is tremendous.
p204
aVWhen players create content in this game, it's automatically sent up to a server
p205
aVand then redistributed to all the other players transparently.
p206
aVSo in fact, as I'm interacting in this world with other creatures,
p207
aVthese creatures are transparently coming from other players as they play.
p208
aVSo the process of playing the game
p209
aVis a process of building up this huge database of content.
p210
aVAnd pretty much everything you're going to see in this game,
p211
aVthere's an editor for that the player can create,
p212
aVup through civilization.
p213
aVThis is my baby. When I eat, I'll actually start growing.
p214
aa(lp215
VThis is the next generation. But I'm going to skip ahead here.
p216
aVNormally what would happen is these creatures would work their way up,
p217
aVeventually become intelligent.
p218
aVI'd start dealing with tribes, cities and civilizations of them over time.
p219
aVI'm going to skip way ahead to the space phase.
p220
aVEventually they would go out into space,
p221
aVand start colonizing and exploring the universe.
p222
aVNow, really, in some sense,
p223
aVI want the players to be building this world in their imagination,
p224
aVand then extracting it from them with the least amount of pain.
p225
aa(lp226
VSo that's kind of what these tools are about.
p227
aVHow do we make the gameplay,
p228
aVyou know, basically the player's imagination amplifier?
p229
aVAnd how do we make these tools, these editors,
p230
aVsomething that are just as fun as the game itself?
p231
aVSo this is the planet that we've been playing on
p232
aVup to this point in the game.
p233
aVSo far the entire game has been played on the surface of this little world here.
p234
aa(lp235
VAt this point we're actually dealing with a very little toy planet.
p236
aVAlmost, again, like the Montessori toy idea.
p237
aVWhat happens if you give somebody a toy planet,
p238
aVand let them play with a lot of dynamics on it?
p239
aVWhat could they discover? What might they learn on this?
p240
aVThis world was actually extracted from the player's imagination.
p241
aVSo, this is the planet that the player evolved on.
p242
aVThings like the buildings, the vehicles, the architecture, civilizations
p243
aVwere all designed by the player up to this point.
p244
aVSo here's a little city with some of our guys walking around in it.
p245
aVAnd most games put the player in the role of Luke Skywalker,
p246
aVthis protagonist playing through this story.
p247
aVThis is more about putting the player in the role of George Lucas.
p248
aVI want them, after they've played this game,
p249
aVto have extracted an entire world that they're now interacting with.
p250
aa(lp251
VAs we pull down here,
p252
aVwe still have a whole set of creatures living on the surface of the planet.
p253
aVAll these different dynamics going on here.
p254
aVI can look over here, and this is a little simplified food web
p255
aVthat's going on with the creatures.
p256
aVI can open this up and then scan what exists on the surface.
p257
aa(lp258
VYou get some sense of the diversity of creatures that were brought in.
p259
aVSome of these were created by the player,
p260
aVothers by other players, automatically sent over here.
p261
aVBut there's a very simple calculation of what's required,
p262
aVhow many plants are required for the herbivores to live,
p263
aVhow many herbivores for the carnivores to eat, etc.,
p264
aVthat you have to balance actively.
p265
aVAlso with this phase,
p266
aVwe're getting more and more God-like powers for the player,
p267
aVand you can experiment with this planet as a toy.
p268
aVSo I can come in and I can do things,
p269
aVand just treat this planet as a lump of clay.
p270
aVWe have very simple weather systems, simple geology.
p271
aVFor instance, I could open one of my tools here and then carve out rivers.
p272
aVSo this whole thing is kind of like a big lump of clay, a sculpture.
p273
aVI can also play with the dynamics in this world over time.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo one of the things I can do
p276
aVis start pumping more CO2 gases into the atmosphere,
p277
aVand so that's what I'm doing here.
p278
aVThere's actually a little readout down there
p279
aVof our planetary atmosphere, pressure and temperature.
p280
aVSo as I start pumping in more atmosphere,
p281
aVwe're going to start pushing up the greenhouse gases here
p282
aVand if you'll start noticing,
p283
aVwe start seeing the ocean levels rise over time.
p284
aVAnd our cities are going to be at risk too,
p285
aVbecause a lot of these are coastal cities.
p286
aVYou can see the ocean levels are rising now
p287
aVand as they encroach upon the cities, I'll start losing cities here.
p288
aa(lp289
VSo basically, I want the players to be able to experiment and explore
p290
aVa huge amount of failure space.
p291
aVSo there goes one city.
p292
aVNow, over time, this is going to heat up the planet.
p293
aVSo at first what we're going to see
p294
aVis a global ocean rise here on this little toy planet,
p295
aVbut then over time \u2014 I can speed it up \u2014
p296
aVwe'll see the heat impact of that as well.
p297
aa(lp298
VNot only will it get hotter,
p299
aVbut at some point it's going to get so hot the oceans will evaporate.
p300
aVThey'll go up, and then they'll evaporate, and that'll be my planet.
p301
aVSo basically, what we're getting here
p302
aVis the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth," in about two minutes,
p303
aVand that actually brings up an interesting point about games.
p304
aVNow here, our entire oceans are evaporating off the surface,
p305
aVand as it keeps getting hotter,
p306
aVat some point the entire planet is going to melt down. Here it goes.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo we're not only simulating biological dynamics \u2014
p309
aVfood webs and all that \u2014
p310
aVbut also geologic, you know, on a very simple core scale.
p311
aVAnd what's interesting to me about games
p312
aVis that I think we can take a lot of long-term dynamics
p313
aVand compress them into very short-term experiences.
p314
aVBecause it's so hard for people to think 50 or 100 years out,
p315
aVbut when you can give them a toy,
p316
aVand they can experience these long-term dynamics in just a few minutes,
p317
aVI think it's an entirely different point of view,
p318
aVwhere we're actually using the game to remap our intuition.
p319
aVIt's almost in the same way
p320
aVthat a telescope or microscope recalibrates your eyesight;
p321
aVI think computer simulations can recalibrate your instinct
p322
aVacross vast scales of both space and time.
p323
aa(lp324
VSo here's our little solar system,
p325
aVas we pull away from our melted planet here.
p326
aVWe actually have a couple of other planets in this solar system.
p327
aVLet's fly to another one.
p328
aVWe're going to have this unlimited number of worlds you can explore here.
p329
aVAs we move into the future,
p330
aVand we start going out into space and doing stuff,
p331
aVwe're drawing a lot from things like science fiction.
p332
aVAnd all my favorite science fiction movies
p333
aVI want to play out here as different dynamics.
p334
aa(lp335
VThis planet actually has some life on it.
p336
aVHere it is, some indigenous life down here.
p337
aVOne of the tools I can eventually earn for my UFO
p338
aVis a monolith that I can drop down.
p339
aa(lp340
V(Laughter)
p341
aa(lp342
VNow, as you can see,
p343
aVthese guys are actually starting to go up and bow to it,
p344
aVand over time, once they touch it, they will become intelligent.
p345
aVSo I can actually pick a species on a planet
p346
aVand then make them sentient.
p347
aVNow they've actually gone to tribal dynamics.
p348
aVAnd now, because I'm actually the one here,
p349
aVI can get out of the UFO and walk up,
p350
aVand they should be worshipping me at this point as a god.
p351
aVAt first they're a little freaked out.
p352
aVOK, well maybe they're not worshipping me.
p353
aa(lp354
V(Laughter)
p355
aa(lp356
VI think I'll leave before they get hostile.
p357
aa(lp358
VBut we basically want a diversity of activities
p359
aVthe players can play through this.
p360
aVI want to be able to play
p361
aV"The Day the Earth Stood Still," "2001: A Space Odyssey,"
p362
aV"Star Trek," "War Of the Worlds."
p363
aVNow, as we pull away from this world \u2014
p364
aVwe're going to keep pulling away from the star now.
p365
aVOne of the things that always frustrated me about astronomy
p366
aVwhen I was a kid
p367
aVis how it was always presented so two-dimensionally and so static.
p368
aVAs we pull away from the star here,
p369
aVwe're actually going now out into interstellar space,
p370
aVand we're getting a sense of the space around our home star.
p371
aa(lp372
VWhat I really wanted to do is to present this, basically,
p373
aVas wonderfully 3D as it is actually is.
p374
aVAnd also show the dynamics,
p375
aVand a lot of the interesting objects that you might find, like, in the Hubble,
p376
aVat pretty much realistic frequencies and scales.
p377
aVSo most people have no idea of the difference
p378
aVbetween an emission nebula and a planetary nebula.
p379
aVBut these are the things
p380
aVthat we can put in this little galaxy here.
p381
aVSo we're flying over here to what looks like a black hole.
p382
aVI want to basically have the entire zoo of Hubble objects
p383
aVthat people can interact with and play with, again, as toys.
p384
aa(lp385
VSo here's a little black hole
p386
aVthat we probably don't want to get too close to.
p387
aVBut we also have stars and things as well.
p388
aVIf we pull all the way back, we start seeing the entire galaxy here,
p389
aVkind of slowly in motion.
p390
aVTypically, when people present galaxies,
p391
aVit's always beautiful photos, but they're always static.
p392
aVAnd when you bring it forward in time and start animating it,
p393
aVit's amazing what a galaxy would look like fast forwarded.
p394
aa(lp395
VThis would be about a million years a second,
p396
aVbecause you have about one supernova every century.
p397
aVAnd so you'd have this wonderful sparkling thing,
p398
aVwith the disk slowly rotating,
p399
aVand this is roughly what it would look like.
p400
aVPart of this is about bringing the beauty of the natural world
p401
aVto somebody in a very imaginative way,
p402
aVso that they can start calibrating their instinct
p403
aVacross these vast scales of space and time.
p404
aa(lp405
VChris was wondering what kind of gods the players would become.
p406
aVBecause if you think about it,
p407
aVyou're going to have 15-year-olds, 20-year-olds flying around this universe.
p408
aVThey might be a nurturing god.
p409
aVThey might be bootstrapping life on planets,
p410
aVtrying to terraform and spread civilization.
p411
aVYou might be a vengeful god, conquesting,
p412
aVbecause you actually can do that, you can attack other intelligent races.
p413
aVYou might be a networking god, building alliances,
p414
aVor just curious, going around and wanting to explore as much as you possibly can.
p415
aa(lp416
VBut basically, the reason why I make toys like this
p417
aVis because I think if there's one difference
p418
aVI could possibly make in the world,
p419
aVthat I would choose to make,
p420
aVit's that I would like to somehow give people
p421
aVjust a little bit better calibration on long-term thinking.
p422
aVBecause I think most of the problems that our world is facing right now
p423
aVare the result of short-term thinking,
p424
aVand the fact that it is so hard for us to think 50, 100, or 1,000 years out.
p425
aVAnd I think by giving kids toys like this and letting them replay dynamics,
