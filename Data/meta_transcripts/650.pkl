VHow do you feed a city?
p4
aVIt's one of the great questions of our time.
p5
aVYet it's one that's rarely asked.
p6
aVWe take it for granted that if we go into a shop
p7
aVor restaurant, or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time,
p8
aVthere is going to be food there waiting for us,
p9
aVhaving magically come from somewhere.
p10
aa(lp11
VBut when you think that every day for a city the size of London,
p12
aVenough food has to be produced,
p13
aVtransported, bought and sold,
p14
aVcooked, eaten, disposed of,
p15
aVand that something similar has to happen every day
p16
aVfor every city on earth,
p17
aVit's remarkable that cities get fed at all.
p18
aa(lp19
VWe live in places like this as if
p20
aVthey're the most natural things in the world,
p21
aVforgetting that because we're animals
p22
aVand that we need to eat,
p23
aVwe're actually as dependent on the natural world
p24
aVas our ancient ancestors were.
p25
aVAnd as more of us move into cities,
p26
aVmore of that natural world is being
p27
aVtransformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me \u2014
p28
aVit's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil \u2014
p29
aVin order to feed us.
p30
aVThese are extraordinary landscapes,
p31
aVbut few of us ever get to see them.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd increasingly these landscapes
p34
aVare not just feeding us either.
p35
aVAs more of us move into cities,
p36
aVmore of us are eating meat,
p37
aVso that a third of the annual grain crop globally
p38
aVnow gets fed to animals
p39
aVrather than to us human animals.
p40
aVAnd given that it takes three times as much grain \u2014
p41
aVactually ten times as much grain \u2014
p42
aVto feed a human if it's passed through an animal first,
p43
aVthat's not a very efficient way of feeding us.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd it's an escalating problem too.
p46
aVBy 2050, it's estimated that twice the number
p47
aVof us are going to be living in cities.
p48
aVAnd it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much
p49
aVmeat and dairy consumed.
p50
aVSo meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand.
p51
aVAnd that's going to pose an enormous problem.
p52
aVSix billion hungry carnivores to feed,
p53
aVby 2050.
p54
aVThat's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are,
p55
aVit's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve.
p56
aa(lp57
VNineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year
p58
aVto create new arable land.
p59
aVAlthough at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount
p60
aVof existing arables to salinization and erosion.
p61
aVWe're very hungry for fossil fuels too.
p62
aVIt takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie
p63
aVof food that we consume in the West.
p64
aVAnd even though there is food that we are producing at great cost,
p65
aVwe don't actually value it.
p66
aVHalf the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away.
p67
aVAnd to end all of this, at the end of this long process,
p68
aVwe're not even managing to feed the planet properly.
p69
aVA billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve.
p70
aVNone of it makes very much sense.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now
p73
aVis controlled by just five multinational corporations,
p74
aVit's a grim picture.
p75
aVAs we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet.
p76
aVAnd if we look to the future,
p77
aVit's an unsustainable diet.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo how did we get here?
p80
aVAnd more importantly, what are we going to do about it?
p81
aVWell, to answer the slightly easier question first,
p82
aVabout 10,000 years ago, I would say,
p83
aVis the beginning of this process
p84
aVin the ancient Near East,
p85
aVknown as the Fertile Crescent.
p86
aVBecause, as you can see, it was crescent shaped.
p87
aVAnd it was also fertile.
p88
aVAnd it was here, about 10,000 years ago,
p89
aVthat two extraordinary inventions,
p90
aVagriculture and urbanism, happened
p91
aVroughly in the same place and at the same time.
p92
aa(lp93
VThis is no accident,
p94
aVbecause agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other.
p95
aVBecause it was discovery of grain
p96
aVby our ancient ancestors for the first time
p97
aVthat produced a food source that was large enough
p98
aVand stable enough to support permanent settlements.
p99
aVAnd if we look at what those settlements were like,
p100
aVwe see they were compact.
p101
aVThey were surrounded by productive farm land
p102
aVand dominated by large temple complexes
p103
aVlike this one at Ur,
p104
aVthat were, in fact, effectively,
p105
aVspiritualized, central food distribution centers.
p106
aa(lp107
VBecause it was the temples that organized the harvest,
p108
aVgathered in the grain, offered it to the gods,
p109
aVand then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people.
p110
aVSo, if you like,
p111
aVthe whole spiritual and physical life of these cities
p112
aVwas dominated by the grain and the harvest
p113
aVthat sustained them.
p114
aVAnd in fact, that's true of every ancient city.
p115
aVBut of course not all of them were that small.
p116
aVFamously, Rome had about a million citizens
p117
aVby the first century A.D.
p118
aVSo how did a city like this feed itself?
p119
aVThe answer is what I call "ancient food miles."
p120
aa(lp121
VBasically, Rome had access to the sea,
p122
aVwhich made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away.
p123
aVThis is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world,
p124
aVbecause it was very difficult to transport food over roads,
p125
aVwhich were rough.
p126
aVAnd the food obviously went off very quickly.
p127
aVSo Rome effectively waged war
p128
aVon places like Carthage and Egypt
p129
aVjust to get its paws on their grain reserves.
p130
aVAnd, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire
p131
aVwas really sort of one long, drawn out
p132
aVmilitarized shopping spree, really.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVIn fact \u2014 I love the fact, I just have to mention this:
p135
aVRome in fact used to import oysters from London,
p136
aVat one stage. I think that's extraordinary.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo Rome shaped its hinterland
p139
aVthrough its appetite.
p140
aVBut the interesting thing is that the other thing also
p141
aVhappened in the pre-industrial world.
p142
aVIf we look at a map of London in the 17th century,
p143
aVwe can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames,
p144
aValong the bottom of this map.
p145
aVSo the grain markets were to the south of the city.
p146
aVAnd the roads leading up from them
p147
aVto Cheapside, which was the main market,
p148
aVwere also grain markets.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd if you look at the name of one of those streets,
p151
aVBread Street, you can tell
p152
aVwhat was going on there 300 years ago.
p153
aVAnd the same of course was true for fish.
p154
aVFish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing.
p155
aVAnd of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market,
p156
aVoperating on-site here until the mid-1980s.
p157
aVWhich is extraordinary, really, when you think about it.
p158
aVEverybody else was wandering around
p159
aVwith mobile phones that looked like bricks
p160
aVand sort of smelly fish happening down on the port.
p161
aa(lp162
VThis is another thing about food in cities:
p163
aVOnce its roots into the city are established,
p164
aVthey very rarely move.
p165
aVMeat is a very different story
p166
aVbecause, of course, animals could walk into the city.
p167
aVSo much of London's meat
p168
aVwas coming from the northwest,
p169
aVfrom Scotland and Wales.
p170
aVSo it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest,
p171
aVwhich is why Smithfield,
p172
aVLondon's very famous meat market, was located up there.
p173
aVPoultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast.
p174
aVI feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway,
p175
aVand so the birds were coming in
p176
aVwith their feet protected with little canvas shoes.
p177
aVAnd then when they hit the eastern end
p178
aVof Cheapside, that's where they were sold,
p179
aVwhich is why it's called Poultry.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd, in fact, if you look at the map of any city
p182
aVbuilt before the industrial age,
p183
aVyou can trace food coming in to it.
p184
aVYou can actually see how it was physically shaped by food,
p185
aVboth by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues.
p186
aVFriday Street, in a previous life,
p187
aVis where you went to buy your fish on a Friday.
p188
aVBut also you have to imagine it full of food.
p189
aVBecause the streets and the public spaces
p190
aVwere the only places where food was bought and sold.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830
p193
aVyou can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this
p194
aVand be unaware of where your food came from.
p195
aVIn fact, if you were having Sunday lunch,
p196
aVthe chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window
p197
aVabout three days earlier.
p198
aVSo this was obviously an organic city,
p199
aVpart of an organic cycle.
p200
aVAnd then 10 years later everything changed.
p201
aa(lp202
VThis is an image of the Great Western in 1840.
p203
aVAnd as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers
p204
aVwere pigs and sheep.
p205
aVSo all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market.
p206
aVThey're being slaughtered out of sight and mind,
p207
aVsomewhere in the countryside.
p208
aVAnd they're coming into the city by rail.
p209
aVAnd this changes everything.
p210
aVTo start off with, it makes it possible
p211
aVfor the first time to grow cities,
p212
aVreally any size and shape, in any place.
p213
aVCities used to be constrained by geography;
p214
aVthey used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means.
p215
aVAll of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd as you can see from these maps of London,
p218
aVin the 90 years after the trains came,
p219
aVit goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed
p220
aVby animals coming in on foot, and so on,
p221
aVto a large splurge,
p222
aVthat would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot,
p223
aVeither animals or people.
p224
aVAnd of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars,
p225
aVand really this marks the end of this process.
p226
aVIt's the final emancipation of the city
p227
aVfrom any apparent relationship with nature at all.
p228
aa(lp229
VAnd this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell,
p230
aVdevoid of mess, certainly devoid of people,
p231
aVbecause nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape.
p232
aVIn fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars,
p233
aVdrove to a box somewhere on the outskirts,
p234
aVcame back with a week's worth of shopping,
p235
aVand wondered what on earth to do with it.
p236
aVAnd this really is the moment when our relationship,
p237
aVboth with food and cities, changes completely.
p238
aa(lp239
VHere we have food \u2014 that used to be the center,
p240
aVthe social core of the city \u2014 at the periphery.
p241
aVIt used to be a social event, buying and selling food.
p242
aVNow it's anonymous.
p243
aVWe used to cook; now we just add water,
p244
aVor a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something.
p245
aVWe don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat.
p246
aVWe just read the back of a label on a packet.
p247
aVAnd we don't value food. We don't trust it.
p248
aVSo instead of trusting it, we fear it.
p249
aVAnd instead of valuing it, we throw it away.
p250
aa(lp251
VOne of the great ironies of modern food systems
p252
aVis that they've made the very thing they promised
p253
aVto make easier much harder.
p254
aVBy making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place,
p255
aVthey've actually distanced us from our most important relationship,
p256
aVwhich is that of us and nature.
p257
aVAnd also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver,
p258
aVthat, as we've seen, are unsustainable.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo what are we going to do about that?
p261
aVIt's not a new question.
p262
aV500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself.
p263
aVThis is the frontispiece of his book "Utopia."
p264
aVAnd it was a series of semi-independent city-states,
p265
aVif that sounds remotely familiar,
p266
aVa day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad,
p267
aVand grew vegetables in their back gardens,
p268
aVand ate communal meals together, and so on.
p269
aVAnd I think you could argue that
p270
aVfood is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia,
p271
aVeven though More never framed it that way.
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd here is another very famous "Utopian" vision,
p274
aVthat of Ebenezer Howard, "The Garden City."
p275
aVSame idea: series of semi-independent city-states,
p276
aVlittle blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around,
p277
aVjoined to one another by railway.
p278
aVAnd again, food could be said to be
p279
aVthe ordering principle of his vision.
p280
aVIt even got built, but nothing to do with
p281
aVthis vision that Howard had.
p282
aVAnd that is the problem with these Utopian ideas,
p283
aVthat they are Utopian.
p284
aa(lp285
VUtopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately.
p286
aVIt was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek.
p287
aVIt can either mean a good place, or no place.
p288
aVBecause it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it.
p289
aVAnd I think, as a conceptual tool
p290
aVfor thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling,
p291
aVthat makes it not much use.
p292
aVSo I've come up with an alternative,
p293
aVwhich is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek,
p294
aV"sitos" for food, and "topos" for place.
p295
aa(lp296
VI believe we already live in Sitopia.
p297
aVWe live in a world shaped by food,
p298
aVand if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool \u2014
p299
aVa conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently.
p300
aVSo if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like?
p301
aVWell I think it looks a bit like this.
p302
aVI have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog.
p303
aVBut anyway, this is \u2014 (Laughter)
p304
aVit's food at the center of life,
p305
aVat the center of family life, being celebrated,
p306
aVbeing enjoyed, people taking time for it.
p307
aVThis is where food should be in our society.
p308
aa(lp309
VBut you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this.
p310
aVBy the way, these can be men as well.
p311
aVIt's people who think about food,
p312
aVwho think ahead, who plan,
p313
aVwho can stare at a pile of raw vegetables
p314
aVand actually recognize them.
p315
aVWe need these people. We're part of a network.
p316
aVBecause without these kinds of people we can't have places like this.
p317
aVHere, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable.
p318
aVBut networks, markets where food is being grown locally.
p319
aVIt's common. It's fresh.
p320
aVIt's part of the social life of the city.
p321
aVBecause without that, you can't have this kind of place,
p322
aVfood that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape,
p323
aVand is not just a zero-sum commodity
p324
aVoff in some unseen hell-hole.
p325
aVCows with a view.
p326
aVSteaming piles of humus.
p327
aVThis is basically bringing the whole thing together.
p328
aa(lp329
VAnd this is a community project
p330
aVI visited recently in Toronto.
p331
aVIt's a greenhouse, where kids get told
p332
aVall about food and growing their own food.
p333
aVHere is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a
p334
aVplant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know.
p335
aVBut anyway, these kinds of projects
p336
aVthat are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.
p337
aa(lp338
VSo Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing.
p339
aVIt's basically recognizing that Sitopia
p340
aValready exists in little pockets everywhere.
p341
aVThe trick is to join them up,
p342
aVto use food as a way of seeing.
p343
aVAnd if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities
p344
aVas big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this.
p345
aVWe're going to see them more like this,
p346
aVas part of the productive, organic framework
p347
aVof which they are inevitably a part,
p348
aVsymbiotically connected.
p349
aVBut of course, that's not a great image either,
p350
aVbecause we need not to be producing food like this anymore.
p351
aVWe need to be thinking more about permaculture,
p352
aVwhich is why I think this image just
p353
aVsums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing.
p354
aVIt's a re-conceptualization
p355
aVof the way food shapes our lives.
p356
aa(lp357
VThe best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.
p358
aVIt's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's "Allegory of Good Government."
p359
aVIt's about the relationship between the city and the countryside.
p360
aVAnd I think the message of this is very clear.
p361
aVIf the city looks after the country,
p362
aVthe country will look after the city.
p363
aVAnd I want us to ask now,
p364
aVwhat would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint
p365
aVif he painted this image today?
p366
aVWhat would an allegory of good government look like today?
p367
aVBecause I think it's an urgent question.
p368
aVIt's one we have to ask,
p369
aVand we have to start answering.
p370
aVWe know we are what we eat.
p371
aVWe need to realize that the world is also what we eat.
p372
aVBut if we take that idea, we can use food
p373
aVas a really powerful tool to shape the world better.
p374
aVThank you very much.
