VThose of you who know me know how passionate I am
p4
aVabout opening the space frontier.
p5
aVSo when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity
p6
aVthe experience of zero gravity, it was incredible.
p7
aVAnd I want to tell you that story.
p8
aVI first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics.
p9
aVIt's a competition we're holding, the second X PRIZE,
p10
aVfor the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days.
p11
aVWe have something called the Genome 100 \u2014
p12
aV100 individuals we're sequencing as part of that.
p13
aVCraig Venter chairs that event.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd I met Professor Hawking,
p16
aVand he said his dream was to travel into space.
p17
aVAnd I said, "I can't take you there,
p18
aVbut I can take you into weightlessness into zero-g.
p19
aVAnd he said, on the spot, "Absolutely, yes."
p20
aVWell, the only way to experience zero-g on Earth
p21
aVis actually with parabolic flight, weightless flight.
p22
aVYou take an airplane, you fly over the top, you're weightless for 25 seconds.
p23
aVCome back down, you weigh twice as much.
p24
aVYou do it again and again.
p25
aVYou can get eight, 10 minutes of weightlessness \u2014
p26
aVhow NASA's trained their astronauts for so long.
p27
aVWe set out to do this.
p28
aVIt took us 11 years to become operational.
p29
aVAnd we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking.
p30
aVWe had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say,
p31
aVyou're crazy, don't do that, you're going kill the guy.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd he wanted to go.
p36
aVWe worked hard to get all the permissions.
p37
aVAnd six months later, we sat down at Kennedy Space Center.
p38
aVWe had a press conference,
p39
aVwe announced our intent to do one zero-g parabola,
p40
aVgive him 25 seconds of zero-g.
p41
aVAnd if it went really well, we might do three parabolas.
p42
aVWell, we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this.
p43
aVAnd what he said, for me, was very moving.
p44
aVHe said, "Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk
p45
aVof being wiped out by disaster ...
p46
aVI think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space.
p47
aVI therefore want to encourage public interest in space."
p48
aVWe took him out to the Kennedy Space Center,
p49
aVup inside the NASA vehicle, into the back of the zero-g airplane.
p50
aa(lp51
VWe had about 20 people who made donations \u2014
p52
aVwe raised $150,000 in donations for children's charities \u2014
p53
aVwho flew with us.
p54
aVA few TEDsters here.
p55
aVWe set up a whole ER.
p56
aVWe had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane.
p57
aVWe were monitoring his PO2 of his blood, his heart rate, his blood pressure.
p58
aVWe had everything all set in case of an emergency;
p59
aVGod knows, you don't want to hurt this world-renowned expert.
p60
aVWe took off from the shuttle landing facility,
p61
aVwhere the shuttle takes off and lands.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I
p64
aVcarefully suspended him into zero-g.
p65
aVOnce he was there, [we] let him go
p66
aVto experience what weightlessness was truly like.
p67
aVAnd after that first parabola, you know,
p68
aVthe doc said everything is great. He was smiling, and we said go.
p69
aVSo we did a second parabola.
p70
aa(lp71
V(Laughter)
p72
aa(lp73
V(Applause)
p74
aa(lp75
VAnd a third.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Applause)
p78
aa(lp79
VWe actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton
p80
aVbecause Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge
p81
aVthat Isaac Newton did.
p82
aVAnd we did a fourth, and a fifth and a sixth.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd a seventh and an eighth.
p87
aVAnd this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VHe was so happy.
p92
aVWe are living on a precious jewel,
p93
aVand it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet.
p94
aVPlease join us in this epic adventure.
p95
aVThank you so much.
