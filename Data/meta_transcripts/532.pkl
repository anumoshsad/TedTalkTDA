VWe look around the media, as we see on the news from Iraq,
p4
aVAfghanistan, Sierra Leone,
p5
aVand the conflict seems incomprehensible to us.
p6
aVAnd that's certainly how it seemed to me when I started this project.
p7
aVBut as a physicist,
p8
aVI thought, well if you give me some data,
p9
aVI could maybe understand this. You know, give us a go.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo as a naive New Zealander
p12
aVI thought, well I'll go to the Pentagon.
p13
aVCan you get me some information?
p14
aV(Laughter)
p15
aVNo. So I had to think a little harder.
p16
aVAnd I was watching the news one night in Oxford.
p17
aVAnd I looked down at the chattering heads on my channel of choice.
p18
aVAnd I saw that there was information there.
p19
aVThere was data within the streams of news that we consume.
p20
aVAll this noise around us actually has information.
p21
aVSo what I started thinking was,
p22
aVperhaps there is something like open source intelligence here.
p23
aVIf we can get enough of these streams of information together,
p24
aVwe can perhaps start to understand the war.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo this is exactly what I did. We started bringing a team together,
p27
aVan interdisciplinary team of scientists,
p28
aVof economists, mathematicians.
p29
aVWe brought these guys together and we started to try and solve this.
p30
aVWe did it in three steps.
p31
aVThe first step we did was to collect. We did 130 different sources of information \u2014
p32
aVfrom NGO reports to newspapers and cable news.
p33
aVWe brought this raw data in and we filtered it.
p34
aVWe extracted the key bits on information to build the database.
p35
aVThat database contained
p36
aVthe timing of attacks,
p37
aVthe location, the size and the weapons used.
p38
aVIt's all in the streams of information we consume daily,
p39
aVwe just have to know how to pull it out.
p40
aVAnd once we had this we could start doing some cool stuff.
p41
aVWhat if we were to look at the distribution of the sizes of attacks?
p42
aVWhat would that tell us?
p43
aa(lp44
VSo we started doing this. And you can see here
p45
aVon the horizontal axis
p46
aVyou've got the number of people killed in an attack
p47
aVor the size of the attack.
p48
aVAnd on the vertical axis you've got the number of attacks.
p49
aVSo we plot data for sample on this.
p50
aVYou see some sort of random distribution \u2014
p51
aVperhaps 67 attacks, one person was killed,
p52
aVor 47 attacks where seven people were killed.
p53
aVWe did this exact same thing for Iraq.
p54
aVAnd we didn't know, for Iraq what we were going to find.
p55
aVIt turns out what we found was pretty surprising.
p56
aVYou take all of the conflict,
p57
aVall of the chaos, all of the noise,
p58
aVand out of that
p59
aVcomes this precise mathematical distribution
p60
aVof the way attacks are ordered in this conflict.
p61
aVThis blew our mind.
p62
aVWhy should a conflict like Iraq have this
p63
aVas its fundamental signature?
p64
aVWhy should there be order in war?
p65
aVWe didn't really understand that.
p66
aVWe thought maybe there is something special about Iraq.
p67
aVSo we looked at a few more conflicts.
p68
aVWe looked at Colombia, we looked at Afghanistan,
p69
aVand we looked at Senegal.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd the same pattern emerged in each conflict.
p72
aVThis wasn't supposed to happen.
p73
aVThese are different wars, with different religious factions,
p74
aVdifferent political factions, and different socioeconomic problems.
p75
aVAnd yet the fundamental patterns underlying them
p76
aVare the same.
p77
aVSo we went a little wider.
p78
aVWe looked around the world at all the data we could get our hands on.
p79
aVFrom Peru to Indonesia,
p80
aVwe studied this same pattern again.
p81
aVAnd we found that not only
p82
aVwere the distributions these straight lines,
p83
aVbut the slope of these lines, they clustered around
p84
aVthis value of alpha equals 2.5.
p85
aVAnd we could generate an equation
p86
aVthat could predict the likelihood of an attack.
p87
aVWhat we're saying here
p88
aVis the probability of an attack killing X number of people
p89
aVin a country like Iraq
p90
aVis equal to a constant, times the size of that attack,
p91
aVraised to the power of negative alpha.
p92
aVAnd negative alpha is the slope of that line I showed you before.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo what?
p95
aVThis is data, statistics. What does it tell us about these conflicts?
p96
aVThat was a challenge we had to face as physicists.
p97
aVHow do we explain this?
p98
aVAnd what we really found was that alpha,
p99
aVif we think about it, is the organizational
p100
aVstructure of the insurgency.
p101
aVAlpha is the distribution of the sizes of attacks,
p102
aVwhich is really the distribution
p103
aVof the group strength carrying out the attacks.
p104
aVSo we look at a process of group dynamics:
p105
aVcoalescence and fragmentation,
p106
aVgroups coming together, groups breaking apart.
p107
aVAnd we start running the numbers on this. Can we simulate it?
p108
aVCan we create the kind of patterns that we're seeing
p109
aVin places like Iraq?
p110
aVTurns out we kind of do a reasonable job.
p111
aVWe can run these simulations.
p112
aVWe can recreate this using a process of group dynamics
p113
aVto explain the patterns that we see
p114
aVall around the conflicts around the world.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo what's going on?
p117
aVWhy should these different \u2014 seemingly different conflicts
p118
aVhave the same patterns?
p119
aVNow what I believe is going on is that
p120
aVthe insurgent forces, they evolve over time. They adapt.
p121
aVAnd it turns out there is only one solution
p122
aVto fight a much stronger enemy.
p123
aVAnd if you don't find that solution as an insurgent force,
p124
aVyou don't exist.
p125
aVSo every insurgent force that is ongoing,
p126
aVevery conflict that is ongoing,
p127
aVit's going to look something like this.
p128
aVAnd that is what we think is happening.
p129
aa(lp130
VTaking it forward, how do we change it?
p131
aVHow do we end a war like Iraq?
p132
aVWhat does it look like?
p133
aVAlpha is the structure. It's got a stable state at 2.5.
p134
aVThis is what wars look like when they continue.
p135
aVWe've got to change that.
p136
aVWe can push it up:
p137
aVthe forces become more fragmented;
p138
aVthere is more of them, but they are weaker.
p139
aVOr we push it down:
p140
aVthey're more robust; there is less groups;
p141
aVbut perhaps you can sit and talk to them.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo this graph here, I'm going to show you now.
p144
aVNo one has seen this before. This is literally
p145
aVstuff that we've come through last week.
p146
aVAnd we see the evolution of Alpha through time.
p147
aVWe see it start. And we see it grow up to the stable state
p148
aVthe wars around the world look like.
p149
aVAnd it stays there through the invasion of Fallujah
p150
aVuntil the Samarra bombings in the
p151
aVIraqi elections of '06.
p152
aVAnd the system gets perturbed. It moves upwards
p153
aVto a fragmented state.
p154
aVThis is when the surge happens.
p155
aVAnd depending on who you ask,
p156
aVthe surge was supposed to push it up even further.
p157
aVThe opposite happened.
p158
aVThe groups became stronger.
p159
aVThey became more robust.
p160
aVAnd so I'm thinking, right, great, it's going to keep going down.
p161
aVWe can talk to them. We can get a solution. The opposite happened.
p162
aVIt's moved up again. The groups are more fragmented.
p163
aVAnd this tells me one of two things.
p164
aVEither we're back where we started
p165
aVand the surge has had no effect;
p166
aVor finally the groups have been fragmented to the extent
p167
aVthat we can start to think about maybe moving out.
p168
aVI don't know what the answer is to that.
p169
aVBut I know that we should be looking at the structure of the insurgency
p170
aVto answer that question.
p171
aVThank you.
