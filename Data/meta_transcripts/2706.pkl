VWhy do we think
p4
aVthat stories by men are deemed to be of universal importance,
p5
aVand stories by women are thought to be merely about women?
p6
aa(lp7
VMy grandmother left school when she was 12.
p8
aVShe had 14 children.
p9
aVMy mother left school when she was 15.
p10
aVShe was a secretary.
p11
aVI graduated from university to become a theater director,
p12
aVand that progress is entirely to do with the fact that people I'll never meet
p13
aVfought for women to have rights,
p14
aVget the vote, get education, have progress.
p15
aVAnd I'm determined to do the same, and obviously you are, too.
p16
aVWhy not?
p17
aa(lp18
V(Applause)
p19
aa(lp20
VSo I started a festival called WOW, Women of the World, seven years ago,
p21
aVand it's now in 20 countries across five continents.
p22
aVAnd one of those countries is Somaliland in Africa.
p23
aVSo I traveled there last year,
p24
aVand part of the joy I had in going there was going to these caves.
p25
aVThe Laas Geel caves.
p26
aVNow, these caves contain some of the oldest cave paintings in the world.
p27
aVThese paintings are thought to be round about 9,000 to 11,000 years old.
p28
aVArt:
p29
aVwhat humanity has done ever since it evolved.
p30
aVIt's how we speak about ourselves,
p31
aVhow we understand our identity,
p32
aVhow we look at our surroundings,
p33
aVwho we find out about each other
p34
aVbecause of the meaning of our lives.
p35
aVThat's what art is for.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo look at this little picture.
p38
aVI think it's a little girl.
p39
aVI thought it was a bit like me when I was a little girl.
p40
aVAnd I thought, well, who painted this joyful, youthful figure?
p41
aVAnd I asked the curator of the caves.
p42
aVI said, "Tell me about the men and women who painted these."
p43
aVAnd he looked at me absolutely askance, and he said,
p44
aV"Women didn't paint these pictures."
p45
aVAnd I said, "Well, it was 11,000 years ago."
p46
aVI said, "How do you know?"
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd he said, "Women don't do these things.
p51
aVMen made these marks. Women don't."
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, I wasn't really surprised,
p54
aVbecause that's an attitude that I've seen continuously
p55
aVall my life as a theater maker.
p56
aVWe are told that divine knowledge comes down through the masculine,
p57
aVwhether it be to the imam, the priest, the rabbi, the holy man.
p58
aVSimilarly, we're told that creative genius resides in the masculine,
p59
aVthat it is the masculine
p60
aVthat will be able to tell us about who we really are,
p61
aVthat the masculine will tell the universal story
p62
aVon behalf of all of us,
p63
aVwhereas women artists will really just talk about women's experiences,
p64
aVwomen's issues only really relevant to women
p65
aVand of passing interest to men \u2014
p66
aVand really only some men.
p67
aVAnd it's that conviction,
p68
aVthat that we are taught,
p69
aVthat I think colors so much of whether we're prepared to believe
p70
aVthat women's stories really matter.
p71
aVAnd unless we're prepared to believe that women's stories really matter,
p72
aVthen women's rights don't really matter,
p73
aVand then change can't really come.
p74
aa(lp75
VI want to tell you about two examples of stories
p76
aVthat are thought to be of universal importance:
p77
aV"E.T." and "Hamlet."
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VSo I took my two children when they were little \u2014
p82
aVCaroline was eight and Robby was five \u2014
p83
aVto see "E.T."
p84
aVAnd it's a fantastic story of this little alien
p85
aVwho ends up in an American family
p86
aVwith a mum, two brothers and a sister,
p87
aVbut he wants to go home.
p88
aVNot only that, but some really bad scientists
p89
aVwant to do some experiments on him,
p90
aVand they're looking for him.
p91
aVSo the children have a plot.
p92
aVThey decide they're going to take him back to his spaceship
p93
aVas soon as they can,
p94
aVand they plop him in a bicycle basket,
p95
aVand off they ride.
p96
aVBut unfortunately, the baddies have found out, and they're catching up
p97
aVand they've got sirens and they've got their guns,
p98
aVthey've got the loud-hailers, it's terribly frightening,
p99
aVand they're closing up on the children,
p100
aVand the children are never going to make it.
p101
aVAnd then all of a sudden, magically, the bikes fly up in the air,
p102
aVover the clouds,
p103
aVover the moon,
p104
aVand they're going to save "E.T."
p105
aa(lp106
VSo I turn to see my children's faces,
p107
aVand Robby is enraptured, he's there with them, he's saving E.T.,
p108
aVhe's a happy boy.
p109
aVAnd I turn to Caroline, and she's crying her eyes out.
p110
aVAnd I said, "What's the matter?"
p111
aVAnd she said, "Why can't I save E.T.? Why can't I come?"
p112
aVAnd then all of a sudden I realized:
p113
aVthey weren't children;
p114
aVthey were boys \u2014
p115
aVall boys.
p116
aVAnd Caroline, who had invested so much in E.T.,
p117
aVwell, she wasn't invited to save him,
p118
aVand she felt humiliated and spurned.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo I wrote to Steven Spielberg \u2014
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p123
aa(lp124
Vand I said, "I don't know if you understand
p125
aVthe psychological importance of what's happened,
p126
aVand are you prepared to pay for the therapy bills?"
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VTwenty years later, I haven't had a word back from him,
p131
aVbut I'm still hopeful.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VBut I thought it was interesting,
p136
aVbecause if you read reviews of what he intended with E.T.,
p137
aVhe says very specifically,
p138
aV"I wanted the world to understand
p139
aVthat we should love and embrace difference."
p140
aVBut somehow he didn't include the idea of girls' difference
p141
aVin this thinking.
p142
aVHe thought he was writing a story about all humanity.
p143
aVCaroline thought he was marginalizing
p144
aVhalf of humanity.
p145
aVHe thought he was writing a story about human goodness;
p146
aVshe thought he was writing a lad's heroic adventure.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd this is common.
p149
aVMen feel they have been given the mantle for universal communication,
p150
aVbut of course, how could they be?
p151
aVThey are writing from male experience through male's eyes.
p152
aVWe have to have a look at this ourselves.
p153
aVWe have to be prepared to go back through all our books and our films,
p154
aVall our favorite things,
p155
aVand say, "Actually, this is written by a male artist \u2014
p156
aVnot an artist.
p157
aVWe have to see that so many of these stories
p158
aVare written through a male perspective.
p159
aVWhich is fine,
p160
aVbut then females need to have 50 percent of the rights
p161
aVfor the stage, the film, the novel,
p162
aVthe place of creativity.
p163
aa(lp164
VLet me talk about "Hamlet."
p165
aVTo be or not to be.
p166
aVThat is the question.
p167
aVBut it's not my question.
p168
aVMy question is: Why was I taught as a young woman
p169
aVthat this was the quintessential example of human dilemma
p170
aVand human experience?
p171
aVIt's a marvelous story,
p172
aVbut actually, it's about a young man fearful that he won't be able to make it
p173
aVas a powerful figure in a male world
p174
aVunless he takes revenge for his father's murder.
p175
aVHe talks a great deal to us about suicide being an option,
p176
aVbut the reality is that the person who actually commits suicide, Ophelia,
p177
aVafter she's been humiliated and abused by him,
p178
aVnever gets a chance to talk to the audience about her feelings.
p179
aVAnd then when he's finished with Ophelia, he turns on his mum,
p180
aVbecause basically she has the audacity to fall in love with his uncle
p181
aVand enjoy sex.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VIt is a great story,
p186
aVbut it is a story about male conflict, male dilemma, male struggle.
p187
aVBut I was told this was the story of human beings,
p188
aVdespite the fact that it only had two women in it.
p189
aVAnd unless I reeducate myself,
p190
aVI am always going to think
p191
aVthat women's stories matter less than men's.
p192
aVA woman could have written "Hamlet,"
p193
aVbut she would have written it differently,
p194
aVand it wouldn't have had global recognition.
p195
aVAs the writer Margaret Atwood says,
p196
aV"When a man writes about doing the dishes,
p197
aVit's realism.
p198
aVWhen a woman writes about doing it,
p199
aVit's an unfortunate genetic disposition."
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VNow, this is not just something that belongs to then.
p204
aVI mean, when I was a young girl,
p205
aVwanting desperately to be a theater director,
p206
aVthis is what my male lecturer said to me:
p207
aV"Well, there are three women directors in Britain," he said, "Jude."
p208
aV"There's Joan Knight, who's a lesbian, there's Joan Littlewood, who's retired,
p209
aVand there's Buzz Goodbody, who's just killed herself.
p210
aVSo, which of those three would you like to be?"
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VNow, leaving aside the disgusting slur on gay women,
p215
aVthe fact is, he wanted to humiliate me.
p216
aVHe thought it was silly that I wanted to be a director.
p217
aVAnd I told my friend Marin Alsop, the conductor, and she said,
p218
aV"Oh yes, well, my music teacher said exactly the same.
p219
aVHe said, 'Women don't conduct.'"
p220
aVBut all these years later, we've made our mark.
p221
aVYou think, "Well, it'll be different now."
p222
aVI'm afraid it's not different now.
p223
aVThe current head of the Paris Conservatoire
p224
aVsaid recently, "It takes great physical strength
p225
aVto conduct a symphony,
p226
aVand women are too weak."
p227
aa(lp228
V(Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VThe artist George Baselitz said,
p231
aV"Well, the fact is women can't paint.
p232
aVWell \u2014 they can't paint very well."
p233
aa(lp234
VThe writer V.S. Naipaul said two years ago,
p235
aV"I can read two paragraphs and know immediately if it's written by a woman,
p236
aVand I just stop reading, because it's not worthy of me."
p237
aa(lp238
VAudience: Whoa!
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd it goes on.
p241
aa(lp242
VWe have to find a way
p243
aVof stopping young girls and women
p244
aVfeeling not only that their story doesn't matter,
p245
aVbut they're not allowed to be the storyteller.
p246
aVBecause once you feel that you can't stand in the central space
p247
aVand speak on behalf of the world,
p248
aVyou will feel that you can offer your goods up to a small, select group.
p249
aVYou will tend to do smaller work on smaller stages,
p250
aVyour economic power will be less,
p251
aVyour reach of audiences will be less,
p252
aVand your credit will be less as an artist.
p253
aVAnd we do finally give artists these incredible, prominent spaces
p254
aVin the world,
p255
aVbecause they are our storytellers.
p256
aa(lp257
VNow, why should it matter to you if you're not an artist?
p258
aVSupposing you're an accountant or an entrepreneur or a medic
p259
aVor a scientist:
p260
aVShould you care about women artists?
p261
aVAbsolutely, you must,
p262
aVbecause as you can see from the cave paintings,
p263
aVall civilizations,
p264
aVall of humanity
p265
aVhave relied upon artists to tell the human story,
p266
aVand if the human story is finally told by men,
p267
aVtake my word for it,
p268
aVit will be about men.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo let's make a change.
p271
aVLet's make a change to all our institutions,
p272
aVand not just in the West.
p273
aVDon't forget \u2014 this message of incapability of women
p274
aVto hold creative genius
p275
aVis being told to girls and women in Nigeria, in China, in Russia,
p276
aVin Indonesia.
p277
aVAll over the world, girls and women are being told
p278
aVthat they can't finally hold the idea of creative inspiration.
p279
aVAnd I want to ask you:
p280
aVDo you believe that?
p281
aVDo you believe that women can be a creative genius?
p282
aa(lp283
V(Applause and cheers)
p284
aa(lp285
VWell then, please go forward,
p286
aVsupport women artists,
p287
aVbuy their work,
p288
aVinsist that their voices are heard,
p289
aVfind platforms on which their voices will be made.
p290
aVAnd remember this:
p291
aVthat in a sense, if we're going to get past this moment
p292
aVof a world where we know that we are unequal,
p293
aVit's artists who have to imagine a different world.
p294
aVAnd I'm calling on all artists, women and men,
p295
aVto imagine a gender-equal world.
p296
aVLet's paint it. Let's draw it.
p297
aVLet's write about it. Let's film it.
p298
aVAnd if we could imagine it,
p299
aVthen we would have the energy and the stamina
p300
aVto work towards it.
p301
aa(lp302
VWhen I see this little girl,
p303
aV11,000 years ago,
p304
aVI want to know that the little girl now
p305
aVcan stand there and think she's entitled to her dreams,
p306
aVshe's entitled to her destiny
p307
aVand she's entitled to speak on behalf of the whole world,
p308
aVbe recognized for it
p309
aVand applauded.
p310
aa(lp311
VThank you.
