VWe need to change the culture in our jails and prisons,
p4
aVespecially for young inmates.
p5
aVNew York state is one of only two in the U.S.
p6
aVthat automatically arrests and tries 16- to 17-year-olds as adults.
p7
aVThis culture of violence takes these young people
p8
aVand puts them in a hostile environment,
p9
aVand the correctional officers pretty much allow any and everything to go on.
p10
aVThere's not really much for these young people to do
p11
aVto actually enhance their talent and actually rehabilitate them.
p12
aVUntil we can raise the age of criminal responsibility to 18,
p13
aVwe need to focus on changing the daily lives of these young people.
p14
aa(lp15
VI know firsthand.
p16
aVBefore I ever turned 18,
p17
aVI spent approximately 400 days on Rikers Island,
p18
aVand to add to that
p19
aVI spent almost 300 days in solitary confinement,
p20
aVand let me tell you this:
p21
aVScreaming at the top of your lungs all day on your cell door
p22
aVor screaming at the top of your lungs out the window,
p23
aVit gets tiring.
p24
aVSince there's not much for you to do while you're in there,
p25
aVyou start pacing back and forth in your cell,
p26
aVyou start talking to yourself,
p27
aVyour thoughts start running wild,
p28
aVand then your thoughts become your own worst enemy.
p29
aVJails are actually supposed to rehabilitate a person,
p30
aVnot cause him or her to become more angry,
p31
aVfrustrated, and feel more hopeless.
p32
aVSince there's not a discharge plan put in place for these young people,
p33
aVthey pretty much  reenter society with nothing.
p34
aVAnd there's not really much for them to do to keep them from recidivating.
p35
aa(lp36
VBut it all starts with the C.O.s.
p37
aVIt's very easy for some people
p38
aVto look at these correctional officers as the good guys
p39
aVand the inmates as the bad guys,
p40
aVor vice versa for some,
p41
aVbut it's a little more than that.
p42
aVSee, these C.O.s are normal, everyday people.
p43
aVThey come from the same neighborhoods as the population they "serve."
p44
aVThey're just normal people.
p45
aVThey're not robots, and there's  nothing special about them.
p46
aVThey do pretty much everything anybody else in society does.
p47
aVThe male C.O.s want to talk and flirt with the female C.O.s.
p48
aVThey play the little high school kid games with each other.
p49
aVThey politic with one another.
p50
aVAnd the female C.O.s gossip to each other.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo I spent numerous amounts of time with numerous amounts of C.O.s,
p53
aVand let me tell you about this one in particular named Monroe.
p54
aVOne day he pulled me in between the A and B doors
p55
aVwhich separate the north and south sides of our housing unit.
p56
aVHe pulled me there because I had a physical altercation
p57
aVwith another young man in my housing unit,
p58
aVand he felt, since there was a female officer working on the floor,
p59
aVthat I violated his shift.
p60
aVSo he punched me in my chest.
p61
aVHe kind of knocked the wind out of me.
p62
aVI wasn't impulsive, I didn't react right away,
p63
aVbecause I know this is their house.
p64
aVI have no wins.
p65
aVAll he has to do is pull his pin and backup will come immediately.
p66
aVSo I just gave him a look in his eyes
p67
aVand I guess he saw the anger and frustration just burning,
p68
aVand he said to me,
p69
aV"Your eyes are going to get you in a lot of trouble,
p70
aVbecause you're looking like you want to fight."
p71
aVSo he commenced to taking off his utility belt,
p72
aVhe took off his shirt and his badge,
p73
aVand he said, "We could fight."
p74
aa(lp75
VSo I asked him, "You gonna hold it down?"
p76
aVNow, that's a term that's commonly used on Rikers Island
p77
aVmeaning that you're not going to say anything to anybody,
p78
aVand you're not going to report it.
p79
aVHe said, "Yeah, I'm gonna hold it down. You gonna hold it down?"
p80
aVI didn't even respond.
p81
aVI just punched him right in his face,
p82
aVand we began fighting right then and there.
p83
aa(lp84
VTowards the end of the fight, he slammed me up against the wall,
p85
aVso while we were tussled up, he said to me, "You good?"
p86
aVas if he got the best of me,
p87
aVbut in my mind, I know I got the best of him,
p88
aVso I replied very cocky,
p89
aV"Oh, I'm good, you good?"
p90
aVHe said, "Yeah, I'm good,  I'm good."
p91
aVWe let go, he shook my hand, said he gave me my respect,
p92
aVgave me a cigarette and sent me on my way.
p93
aa(lp94
VBelieve it or not, you come across some C.O.s on Rikers Island
p95
aVthat'll fight you one-on-one.
p96
aVThey feel that they understand how it is,
p97
aVand they feel that I'm going to meet you where you're at.
p98
aVSince this is how you commonly handle your disputes,
p99
aVwe can handle it in that manner.
p100
aVI walk away from it like a man, you walk away from it like a man,
p101
aVand that's it.
p102
aVSome C.O.s feel that they're jailing with you.
p103
aVThis is why they have that mentality and that attitude
p104
aVand they go by that concept.
p105
aVIn some instances, we're in it together with the C.O.s.
p106
aVHowever, institutions need to give these correctional officers
p107
aVproper trainings on how to properly deal with the adolescent population,
p108
aVand they also need to give them proper trainings
p109
aVon how to deal with  the mental health population as well.
p110
aVThese C.O.s play a big factor in these young people's lives
p111
aVfor x amount of time until a disposition is reached on their case.
p112
aVSo why not try to mentor these young people while they're there?
p113
aVWhy not try to give them some type of insight to make a change,
p114
aVso once they reenter back into society,
p115
aVthey're doing something positive?
p116
aa(lp117
VA second big thing to help our teens in jails is better programming.
p118
aVWhen I was on Rikers Island, the huge thing was solitary confinement.
p119
aVSolitary confinement was originally designed
p120
aVto break a person mentally, physically and emotionally.
p121
aVThat's what it was designed for.
p122
aVThe U.S. Attorney General recently released a report
p123
aVstating that they're going to ban solitary confinement
p124
aVin New York state for teens.
p125
aa(lp126
VOne thing that kept me sane while I was in solitary confinement was reading.
p127
aVI tried to educate myself as much as possible.
p128
aVI read any and everything I could get my hands on.
p129
aVAnd aside from that, I wrote music and short stories.
p130
aVSome programs that I feel would benefit our young people
p131
aVare art therapy programs
p132
aVfor the kids that like to draw and have that talent,
p133
aVand what about the young individuals that are musically inclined?
p134
aVHow about a music program for them that actually teaches them
p135
aVhow to write and make music?
p136
aVJust a thought.
p137
aa(lp138
VWhen adolescents come to Rikers Island,
p139
aVC74, RNDC is the building that they're housed in.
p140
aVThat's nicknamed "gladiator school,"
p141
aVbecause you have a young individual coming in from the street
p142
aVthinking that they're tough,
p143
aVbeing surrounded by a bunch of other young individuals
p144
aVfrom all of the five boroughs, and everybody feels that they're tough.
p145
aVSo now you have a bunch of young gentlemen poking their chests out
p146
aVfeeling that I have to prove I'm equally as tough as you
p147
aVor I'm tougher than you, you and you.
p148
aVBut let's be honest:
p149
aVThat culture is very dangerous and damaging to our young people.
p150
aVWe need to help institutions and these teens realize
p151
aVthat they don't have to lead the previous lifestyle that they led
p152
aVwhen they were on the street, that they can actually make a change.
p153
aa(lp154
VIt's sad to report that while I was in prison,
p155
aVI used to hear dudes talking about when they get released from prison,
p156
aVwhat type of crimes they're going to commit
p157
aVwhen they get back in the street.
p158
aVThe conversations used to sound something like this:
p159
aV"Oh, when I hit the street, my brother got this connection
p160
aVfor this, that and the third,"
p161
aVor, "My man over here got this connection for the low price.
p162
aVLet's exchange information,"
p163
aVand, "When we hit the town, we're going to do it real big."
p164
aVI used to hear these conversations and think to myself, "Wow,
p165
aVthese dudes are really talking about going back in the street
p166
aVand committing future crimes."
p167
aVSo I came up with a name for that:
p168
aVI called it a go-back-to-jail-quick scheme
p169
aVbecause really, how long is that going to last?
p170
aVYou get a retirement plan with that?
p171
aVNice little pension? 401(k)? 403(b)?
p172
aVYou get health insurance? Dental?
p173
aV(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VBut I will tell you this:
p176
aVBeing in jail and being in prison,
p177
aVI came across some of the most intelligent, brilliant,
p178
aVand talented people that I would ever meet.
p179
aVI've seen individuals take a potato chip bag
p180
aVand turn it into the most beautiful picture frame.
p181
aVI've seen individuals take the state soap that's provided for free
p182
aVand turn them into the most beautiful sculptures
p183
aVthat would make Michelangelo look like a kindergartner made it.
p184
aa(lp185
VAt the age of 21, I was in a maximum-security prison
p186
aVcalled Elmira Correctional Facility.
p187
aVI just came out of the weight shack from working out,
p188
aVand I saw an older gentleman that I knew standing in the middle of the yard
p189
aVjust looking up at the sky.
p190
aVMind you, this older gentlemen was serving a 33-and-a-third-to-life sentence
p191
aVin which he already had served 20 years of that sentence.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo I walk up to him and I said,
p194
aV"O.G., what's going on, man, you good?"
p195
aa(lp196
VHe looked at me, and he said, "Yeah, I'm good, young blood."
p197
aa(lp198
VI'm like, "So what are you looking up at the sky for, man?
p199
aVWhat's so fascinating up there?"
p200
aa(lp201
VHe said, "You look up and you tell me what you see."
p202
aa(lp203
V"Clouds." (Laughter)
p204
aa(lp205
VHe said, "All right. What else do you see?"
p206
aVAt that time, it was a plane passing by.
p207
aa(lp208
VI said, "All right, I see an airplane."
p209
aa(lp210
VHe said, "Exactly, and what's  on that airplane?" "People."
p211
aV"Exactly. Now where's that plane and those people going?"
p212
aa(lp213
V"I don't know. You know?
p214
aVPlease let me know if you do. Then let me get some lottery numbers."
p215
aa(lp216
VHe said, "You're missing the big picture, young blood.
p217
aVThat plane with those people is going somewhere,
p218
aVwhile we're here stuck.
p219
aVThe big picture is this:
p220
aVThat plane with those people going somewhere,
p221
aVthat's life passing us by while we behind these walls, stuck."
p222
aa(lp223
VEver since that day,
p224
aVthat sparked something in my mind and made me know I had to make a change.
p225
aVGrowing up, I was always a good, smart kid.
p226
aVSome people would say I was a little too smart for my own good.
p227
aVI had dreams of becoming an architect or an archaeologist.
p228
aa(lp229
VCurrently, I'm working at the Fortune Society,
p230
aVwhich is a reentry program,
p231
aVand I work with people as a case manager that are at high risk for recidivism.
p232
aVSo I connect them with the services that they need
p233
aVonce they're released from jail and prison
p234
aVso they can make a positive transition back into society.
p235
aVIf I was to see my 15-year-old self today,
p236
aVI would sit down and talk to him and try to educate him
p237
aVand I would let him know, "Listen, this is me. I'm you.
p238
aVThis is us. We are one.
p239
aVEverything that you're about to do, I know what you're gonna do
p240
aVbefore you do it because I already did it,
p241
aVand I would encourage him not to hang out with x, y and z people.
p242
aVI would tell him not to be in such-and-such place.
p243
aVI would tell him, keep your behind in school, man,
p244
aVbecause that's where you need to be,
p245
aVbecause that's what's going to get you somewhere in life.
p246
aVThis is the message that we should be sharing
p247
aVwith our young men and young women.
p248
aVWe shouldn't be treating them as adults and putting them in cultures of violence
p249
aVthat are nearly impossible for them to escape.
