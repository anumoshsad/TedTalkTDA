VI design engineering projects
p4
aVfor middle school and high school students,
p5
aVoften using materials that are pretty unexpected.
p6
aVMy inspiration comes from problems in my daily life.
p7
aVFor example,
p8
aVone time I needed a costume to go to a comic convention,
p9
aVbut I didn't want to spend too much money,
p10
aVso I made my own ...
p11
aVwith a light-up crown and skirt.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VAnother time,
p16
aVI was devastated because my favorite mobile game,
p17
aVFlappy Bird,
p18
aVwas being taken off the app store.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VSo I was faced with the dilemma
p23
aVto either never update my phone or never play Flappy Bird again.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VUnhappy with both options,
p28
aVI did the only thing that made sense to me.
p29
aVI made a physical version of Flappy Bird
p30
aVthat could never be taken off the app store.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34

p37
aa(lp38
V(Music)
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VSo a few of my friends were also pretty addicted to the game,
p43
aVand I invited them to play as well.
p44
aa(lp45
V(Video) Friend: Ah!
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
V(Video) Friend: What the heck?
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd they told me that it was just as infuriating as the original game.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VSo I uploaded a demo of this project online,
p58
aVand to my surprise it went viral.
p59
aVIt had over two million views in just a few days.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd what's more interesting are people's comments.
p64
aVA lot of people wanted to make it their own,
p65
aVor asked me how it was made.
p66
aVSo this kind of confirmed my idea that through a creative project,
p67
aVwe can teach people about engineering.
p68
aa(lp69
VWith the money made from the viral video,
p70
aVwe were able to let students in our classroom
p71
aVall make their own game in a box.
p72
aVAlthough it was pretty challenging,
p73
aVthey learned a lot of new concepts in engineering and programming.
p74
aVAnd they were all eager to learn so they could finish the game as well.
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VSo before Flappy Bird Box,
p79
aVI had the idea of using creative engineering projects to teach students.
p80
aVWhen I was teaching at a middle school,
p81
aVwe asked our students to build a robot from a standard technology kit.
p82
aVAnd I noticed that a lot of them seemed bored.
p83
aVThen a few of them started taking pieces of paper
p84
aVand decorating their robots.
p85
aVAnd then more of them got into it,
p86
aVand they became more interested in the project.
p87
aVSo I started looking for more creative ways
p88
aVto introduce technology to students.
p89
aVWhat I found was that most technology kits available in school
p90
aVlook a little intimidating.
p91
aVThey're all made of plastic parts that you can't customize.
p92
aVOn top of that, they're all very expensive,
p93
aVcosting hundreds of dollars per kit.
p94
aVSo that's certainly not very affordable for most classroom budgets.
p95
aa(lp96
VSince I didn't find anything,
p97
aVI decided to make something on my own.
p98
aVI started with paper and fabric.
p99
aVAfter all, we all played with those since we were kids,
p100
aVand they are also pretty cheap
p101
aVand can be found anywhere around the house.
p102
aVAnd I prototyped a project
p103
aVwhere students can create a light-up creature
p104
aVusing fabric and googly eyes.
p105
aVThey were all helping each other in classrooms,
p106
aVand were laughing and discussing the project.
p107
aVAnd most importantly,
p108
aVthey were able to insert their own creativity into the project.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo because of the success of this project,
p111
aVI continued to create more engineering projects
p112
aVto challenge my students.
p113
aVAnd I also started to take these workshops outside of school
p114
aVand into the community.
p115
aVAnd something really interesting happened.
p116
aVI noticed a lot of people from very diverse backgrounds
p117
aVstarted coming to our workshops.
p118
aVAnd specifically,
p119
aVthere were a lot more women and minorities than I expected,
p120
aVand that you wouldn't usually see at a traditional engineering workshop.
p121
aa(lp122
VNow take a look at this employee report at a major technology company in 2016.
p123
aVWomen make up only 19 percent of the technology workforce.
p124
aVAnd underrepresented minorities make up only four percent.
p125
aVThis statistic might look familiar
p126
aVif you walked into a high school robotics club,
p127
aVor a college engineering class.
p128
aa(lp129
VNow, there's a wide variety of problems
p130
aVthat contribute to the lack of diversity in the technology force.
p131
aVPerhaps one solution could be
p132
aVto introduce technology to students through creative projects.
p133
aVI'm not saying that this could solve everything,
p134
aVbut it could introduce technology
p135
aVto people who originally wouldn't be interested in it
p136
aVbecause of how it has been portrayed and taught in school.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo how do we start to change the perception of technology?
p139
aVMost students think that it's boring or unwelcoming,
p140
aVso I have always designed projects following three principles.
p141
aVFirst is having a low floor,
p142
aVand that means this project is easy to get started.
p143
aVSo take a look at this tutorial.
p144
aVThe first project we asked students to learn
p145
aVis to make a circuit on paper.
p146
aVAs you can see, it doesn't take very long to learn,
p147
aVand it's pretty easy even for beginners.
p148
aVAnd having a low floor also means that we're removing the financial barrier
p149
aVthat prevents people from completing a project.
p150
aVSo with paper, copper tape, lightbulb and a battery,
p151
aVpeople can complete this project for under a dollar.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo second principle is having a high ceiling.
p154
aVThis means that there's a lot of room to grow,
p155
aVand students are constantly being challenged.
p156
aVAt first it might just be a light-up creature,
p157
aVbut then you can add sensors and microcontrollers,
p158
aVand start to program the creature to interact with its environment.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd finally,
p163
aVthe third principle is customization.
p164
aVThis means that we can make this project relevant to anyone.
p165
aVThat's the beauty of using everyday materials;
p166
aVit's very easy to customize using paper and fabric.
p167
aVSo even if you don't like Flappy Bird,
p168
aVyou can still make your own game.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Video) Student: So our game is about Justin Bieber,
p171
aVbecause he's been speeding,
p172
aVand the object is to prevent him from getting caught by the LAPD \u2014
p173
aa(lp174
V(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
V(Video) Student: Yeah, but he's changing so \u2014
p177
aVwe're a part of his posse.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VThank you.
