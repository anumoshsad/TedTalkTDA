VMarco Tempest: What I'd like to show you today
p4
aVis something in the way of an experiment.
p5
aVToday's its debut.
p6
aVIt's a demonstration of augmented reality.
p7
aVAnd the visuals you're about to see are not prerecorded.
p8
aVThey are live
p9
aVand reacting to me in real time.
p10
aVI like to think of it as a kind of technological magic.
p11
aVSo fingers crossed.
p12
aVAnd keep your eyes on the big screen.
p13
aa(lp14
VAugmented reality
p15
aVis the melding of the real world
p16
aVwith computer-generated imagery.
p17
aVIt seems the perfect medium
p18
aVto investigate magic
p19
aVand ask, why, in a technological age,
p20
aVwe continue to have
p21
aVthis magical sense of wonder.
p22
aVMagic is deception,
p23
aVbut it is a deception we enjoy.
p24
aVTo enjoy being deceived,
p25
aVan audience must first
p26
aVsuspend its disbelief.
p27
aVIt was the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge
p28
aVwho first suggested this receptive state of mind.
p29
aa(lp30
VSamuel Taylor Coleridge: I try to convey a semblance of truth in my writing
p31
aVto produce for these shadows of the imagination
p32
aVa willing suspension of disbelief
p33
aVthat, for a moment,
p34
aVconstitutes poetic faith.
p35
aa(lp36
VMT: This faith in the fictional is essential
p37
aVfor any kind of theatrical experience.
p38
aVWithout it,
p39
aVa script is just words.
p40
aVAugmented reality
p41
aVis just the latest technology.
p42
aVAnd sleight of hand
p43
aVis just an artful demonstration
p44
aVof dexterity.
p45
aVWe are all very good at suspending our disbelief.
p46
aVWe do it every day,
p47
aVwhile reading novels,
p48
aVwatching television
p49
aVor going to the movies.
p50
aVWe willingly enter fictional worlds
p51
aVwhere we cheer our heroes
p52
aVand cry for friends we never had.
p53
aVWithout this ability
p54
aVthere is no magic.
p55
aa(lp56
VIt was Jean Robert-Houdin,
p57
aVFrance's greatest illusionist,
p58
aVwho first recognized the role of the magician
p59
aVas a storyteller.
p60
aVHe said something that I've posted on the wall of my studio.
p61
aa(lp62
VJean Robert-Houdin: A conjurer is not a juggler.
p63
aVHe is an actor playing the part of a magician.
p64
aa(lp65
VMT: Which means magic is theater
p66
aVand every trick
p67
aVis a story.
p68
aVThe tricks of magic
p69
aVfollow the archetypes of narrative fiction.
p70
aVThere are tales of creation and loss,
p71
aVdeath and resurrection,
p72
aVand obstacles that must be overcome.
p73
aVNow many of them are intensely dramatic.
p74
aVMagicians play with fire and steel,
p75
aVdefy the fury of the buzzsaw,
p76
aVdare to catch a bullet
p77
aVor attempt a deadly escape.
p78
aVBut audiences don't come to see the magician die,
p79
aVthey come to see him live.
p80
aVBecause the best stories
p81
aValways have a happy ending.
p82
aa(lp83
VThe tricks of magic have one special element.
p84
aVThey are stories with a twist.
p85
aVNow Edward de Bono argued
p86
aVthat our brains are pattern matching machines.
p87
aVHe said that magicians deliberately exploit
p88
aVthe way their audiences think.
p89
aa(lp90
VEdward de Bono: Stage magic relies almost wholly
p91
aVon the momentum error.
p92
aVThe audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations
p93
aVthat are perfectly reasonable,
p94
aVbut do not, in fact, match
p95
aVwhat is being done in front of them.
p96
aa(lp97
VMT: In that respect,
p98
aVmagic tricks are like jokes.
p99
aVJokes lead us down a path
p100
aVto an expected destination.
p101
aVBut when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips
p102
aVinto something entirely unexpected,
p103
aVwe laugh.
p104
aVThe same thing happens
p105
aVwhen people watch magic tricks.
p106
aVThe finale
p107
aVdefies logic,
p108
aVgives new insight into the problem,
p109
aVand audiences express their amazement
p110
aVwith laughter.
p111
aVIt's fun to be fooled.
p112
aa(lp113
VOne of the key qualities of all stories
p114
aVis that they're made to be shared.
p115
aVWe feel compelled to tell them.
p116
aVWhen I do a trick at a party \u2014
p117
aV(Laughter)
p118
aVthat person will immediately pull their friend over
p119
aVand ask me to do it again.
p120
aVThey want to share the experience.
p121
aVThat makes my job more difficult,
p122
aVbecause, if I want to surprise them,
p123
aVI need to tell a story that starts the same,
p124
aVbut ends differently \u2014
p125
aVa trick with a twist
p126
aVon a twist.
p127
aVIt keeps me busy.
p128
aa(lp129
VNow experts believe
p130
aVthat stories go beyond our capacity for keeping us entertained.
p131
aVWe think in narrative structures.
p132
aVWe connect events and emotions
p133
aVand instinctively transform them
p134
aVinto a sequence that can be easily understood.
p135
aVIt's a uniquely human achievement.
p136
aVWe all want to share our stories,
p137
aVwhether it is the trick we saw at the party,
p138
aVthe bad day at the office
p139
aVor the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation.
p140
aa(lp141
VToday, thanks to technology,
p142
aVwe can share those stories as never before,
p143
aVby email, Facebook,
p144
aVblogs, tweets,
p145
aVon TED.com.
p146
aVThe tools of social networking,
p147
aVthese are the digital campfires
p148
aVaround which the audience gathers
p149
aVto hear our story.
p150
aVWe turn facts into similes and metaphors,
p151
aVand even fantasies.
p152
aVWe polish the rough edges of our lives
p153
aVso that they feel whole.
p154
aVOur stories make us the people we are
p155
aVand, sometimes, the people we want to be.
p156
aVThey give us our identity
p157
aVand a sense of community.
p158
aVAnd if the story is a good one,
p159
aVit might even make us smile.
