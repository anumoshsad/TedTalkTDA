VI'm going to ask and try to answer,
p4
aVin some ways, kind of an uncomfortable question.
p5
aVBoth civilians, obviously, and soldiers
p6
aVsuffer in war;
p7
aVI don't think any civilian has ever missed
p8
aVthe war that they were subjected to.
p9
aVI've been covering wars for almost 20 years,
p10
aVand one of the remarkable things for me
p11
aVis how many soldiers find themselves missing it.
p12
aVHow is it someone can go through
p13
aVthe worst experience imaginable,
p14
aVand come home, back to their home,
p15
aVand their family, their country, and miss the war?
p16
aVHow does that work? What does it mean?
p17
aVWe have to answer that question,
p18
aVbecause if we don't, it'll be impossible
p19
aVto bring soldiers back
p20
aVto a place in society where they belong,
p21
aVand I think it'll also be impossible to stop war,
p22
aVif we don't understand how that mechanism works.
p23
aa(lp24
VThe problem is that war
p25
aVdoes not have a simple, neat truth,
p26
aVone simple, neat truth.
p27
aa(lp28
VAny sane person hates war,
p29
aVhates the idea of war,
p30
aVwouldn't want to have anything to do with it,
p31
aVdoesn't want to be near it, doesn't want to know about it.
p32
aVThat's a sane response to war.
p33
aVBut if I asked all of you in this room,
p34
aVwho here has paid money
p35
aVto go to a cinema
p36
aVand be entertained by a Hollywood war movie,
p37
aVmost of you would probably raise your hands.
p38
aVThat's what's so complicated about war.
p39
aVAnd trust me, if a room full of peace-loving people
p40
aVfinds something compelling about war,
p41
aVso do 20-year-old soldiers
p42
aVwho have been trained in it, I promise you.
p43
aVThat's the thing that has to be understood.
p44
aa(lp45
VI've covered war for about 20 years, as I said,
p46
aVbut my most intense experiences in combat
p47
aVwere with American soldiers in Afghanistan.
p48
aVI've been in Africa, the Middle East,
p49
aVAfghanistan in the '90s,
p50
aVbut it was with American soldiers in 2007, 2008,
p51
aVthat I was confronted with
p52
aVvery intense combat.
p53
aVI was in a small valley called the Korengal Valley
p54
aVin eastern Afghanistan.
p55
aVIt was six miles long.
p56
aVThere were 150 men of Battle Company in that valley,
p57
aVand for a while, while I was there,
p58
aValmost 20 percent of all the combat
p59
aVin all of Afghanistan was happening
p60
aVin those six miles.
p61
aVA hundred and fifty men were absorbing
p62
aValmost a fifth of the combat for all of NATO forces
p63
aVin the country, for a couple months.
p64
aVIt was very intense.
p65
aVI spent most of my time at a small outpost
p66
aVcalled Restrepo.
p67
aVIt was named after the platoon medic
p68
aVthat had been killed about two months into the deployment.
p69
aVIt was a few plywood B-huts
p70
aVclinging to a side of a ridge,
p71
aVand sandbags, bunkers, gun positions,
p72
aVand there were 20 men up there
p73
aVof Second Platoon, Battle Company.
p74
aVI spent most of my time up there.
p75
aVThere was no running water.
p76
aVThere was no way to bathe.
p77
aVThe guys were up there for a month at a time.
p78
aVThey never even got out of their clothes.
p79
aVThey fought. The worked.
p80
aVThey slept in the same clothes.
p81
aVThey never took them off, and at the end of the month,
p82
aVthey went back down to the company headquarters,
p83
aVand by then, their clothes were unwearable.
p84
aVThey burned them and got a new set.
p85
aVThere was no Internet. There was no phone.
p86
aVThere was no communication with the outside world up there.
p87
aVThere was no cooked food.
p88
aVThere was nothing up there
p89
aVthat young men typically like:
p90
aVno cars, no girls, no television, nothing
p91
aVexcept combat.
p92
aVCombat they did learn to like.
p93
aa(lp94
VI remember one day, it was a very hot day
p95
aVin the spring,
p96
aVand we hadn't been in a fight
p97
aVin a couple of weeks, maybe.
p98
aVUsually, the outpost was attacked,
p99
aVand we hadn't seen any combat in a couple of weeks,
p100
aVand everyone was just stunned
p101
aVwith boredom and heat.
p102
aVAnd I remember the lieutenant walking past me
p103
aVsort of stripped to the waist.
p104
aVIt was incredibly hot.
p105
aVStripped to the waist, walked past me muttering,
p106
aV"Oh God, please someone attack us today."
p107
aVThat's how bored they were.
p108
aVThat's war too, is a lieutenant saying,
p109
aV"Please make something happen
p110
aVbecause we're going crazy."
p111
aa(lp112
VTo understand that,
p113
aVyou have to, for a moment,
p114
aVthink about combat not morally \u2014
p115
aVthat's an important job to do \u2014
p116
aVbut for a moment, don't think about it morally,
p117
aVthink about it neurologically.
p118
aVLet's think about what happens in your brain
p119
aVwhen you're in combat.
p120
aVFirst of all, the experience
p121
aVis very bizarre, it's a very bizarre one.
p122
aVIt's not what I had expected.
p123
aVUsually, you're not scared.
p124
aVI've been very scared in combat,
p125
aVbut most of the time when I was out there,
p126
aVI wasn't scared.
p127
aVI was very scared beforehand
p128
aVand incredibly scared afterwards,
p129
aVand that fear that comes afterwards can last years.
p130
aVI haven't been shot at in six years,
p131
aVand I was woken up very abruptly this morning
p132
aVby a nightmare that I was being strafed by aircraft,
p133
aVsix years later.
p134
aVI've never even been strafed by aircraft,
p135
aVand I was having nightmares about it.
p136
aVTime slows down.
p137
aVYou get this weird tunnel vision.
p138
aVYou notice some details very, very, very accurately
p139
aVand other things drop out.
p140
aVIt's almost a slightly altered state of mind.
p141
aVWhat's happening in your brain
p142
aVis you're getting an enormous amount of adrenaline
p143
aVpumped through your system.
p144
aVYoung men will go to great lengths
p145
aVto have that experience.
p146
aVIt's wired into us.
p147
aVIt's hormonally supported.
p148
aVThe mortality rate for young men in society
p149
aVis six times what it is for young women
p150
aVfrom violence and from accidents,
p151
aVjust the stupid stuff that young men do:
p152
aVjumping off of things they shouldn't jump off of,
p153
aVlighting things on fire they shouldn't light on fire,
p154
aVI mean, you know what I'm talking about.
p155
aVThey die at six times the rate
p156
aVthat young women do.
p157
aVStatistically, you are safer as a teenage boy,
p158
aVyou would be safer in the fire department
p159
aVor the police department in most American cities
p160
aVthan just walking around the streets of your hometown
p161
aVlooking for something to do,
p162
aVstatistically.
p163
aa(lp164
VYou can imagine how that plays out in combat.
p165
aVAt Restrepo, every guy up there was almost killed,
p166
aVincluding me,
p167
aVincluding my good friend Tim Hetherington,
p168
aVwho was later killed in Libya.
p169
aVThere were guys walking around
p170
aVwith bullet holes in their uniforms,
p171
aVrounds that had cut through the fabric
p172
aVand didn't touch their bodies.
p173
aa(lp174
VI was leaning against some sandbags one morning,
p175
aVnot much going on, sort of spacing out,
p176
aVand some sand was kicked into the side of,
p177
aVsort of hit the side of my face.
p178
aVSomething hit the side of my face, and I didn't know what it was.
p179
aVYou have to understand about bullets
p180
aVthat they go a lot faster than sound,
p181
aVso if someone shoots at you
p182
aVfrom a few hundred meters,
p183
aVthe bullet goes by you, or hits you obviously,
p184
aVhalf a second or so before the sound catches up to it.
p185
aVSo I had some sand sprayed in the side of my face.
p186
aVHalf a second later, I heard dut-dut-dut-dut-duh.
p187
aVIt was machine gun fire.
p188
aVIt was the first round, the first burst
p189
aVof an hour-long firefight.
p190
aVWhat had happened was the bullet hit,
p191
aVa bullet hit three or four inches from the side of my head.
p192
aVImagine, just think about it, because I certainly did,
p193
aVthink about the angle of deviation that saved my life.
p194
aVAt 400 meters, it missed me by three inches.
p195
aVJust think about the math on that.
p196
aVEvery guy up there
p197
aVhad some experience like that,
p198
aVat least once, if not many times.
p199
aa(lp200
VThe boys are up there for a year.
p201
aVThey got back.
p202
aVSome of them got out of the Army
p203
aVand had tremendous psychological problems when they got home.
p204
aVSome of them stayed in the Army
p205
aVand were more or less okay, psychologically.
p206
aVI was particularly close to a guy named Brendan O'Byrne.
p207
aVI'm still very good friends with him.
p208
aVHe came back to the States. He got out of the Army.
p209
aVI had a dinner party one night.
p210
aVI invited him,
p211
aVand he started talking with a woman,
p212
aVone of my friends,
p213
aVand she knew how bad it had been out there,
p214
aVand she said, "Brendan,
p215
aVis there anything at all that you miss about
p216
aVbeing out in Afghanistan, about the war?"
p217
aVAnd he thought about it quite a long time,
p218
aVand finally he said, "Ma'am, I miss almost all of it."
p219
aVAnd he's one of the most traumatized people
p220
aVI've seen from that war.
p221
aV"Ma'am, I miss almost all of it."
p222
aa(lp223
VWhat is he talking about?
p224
aVHe's not a psychopath.
p225
aVHe doesn't miss killing people.
p226
aVHe's not crazy. He doesn't miss getting shot at
p227
aVand seeing his friends get killed.
p228
aVWhat is it that he misses? We have to answer that.
p229
aVIf we're going to stop war, we have to answer that question.
p230
aa(lp231
VI think what he missed is brotherhood.
p232
aVHe missed, in some ways,
p233
aVthe opposite of killing.
p234
aVWhat he missed was connection
p235
aVto the other men he was with.
p236
aVNow, brotherhood is different from friendship.
p237
aVFriendship happens in society, obviously.
p238
aVThe more you like someone,
p239
aVthe more you'd be willing to do for them.
p240
aVBrotherhood has nothing to do
p241
aVwith how you feel about the other person.
p242
aVIt's a mutual agreement in a group
p243
aVthat you will put the welfare of the group,
p244
aVyou will put the safety of everyone in the group
p245
aVabove your own.
p246
aVIn effect, you're saying,
p247
aV"I love these other people more than I love myself."
p248
aa(lp249
VBrendan was a team leader
p250
aVin command of three men,
p251
aVand the worst day in Afghanistan \u2014
p252
aVHe was almost killed so many times.
p253
aVIt didn't bother him.
p254
aVThe worst thing that happened to him in Afghanistan
p255
aVwas one of his men was hit in the head with a bullet
p256
aVin the helmet, knocked him over.
p257
aVThey thought he was dead.
p258
aVIt was in the middle of a huge firefight.
p259
aVNo one could deal with it, and a minute later,
p260
aVKyle Steiner sat back up
p261
aVfrom the dead, as it were,
p262
aVbecause he'd come back to consciousness.
p263
aVThe bullet had just knocked him out.
p264
aVIt glanced off the helmet.
p265
aVHe remembers people saying,
p266
aVas he was sort of half-conscious,
p267
aVhe remembers people saying,
p268
aV"Steiner's been hit in the head. Steiner's dead."
p269
aVAnd he was thinking, "I'm not dead."
p270
aVAnd he sat up.
p271
aVAnd Brendan realized after that
p272
aVthat he could not protect his men,
p273
aVand that was the only time he cried in Afghanistan,
p274
aVwas realizing that.
p275
aVThat's brotherhood.
p276
aa(lp277
VThis wasn't invented recently.
p278
aVMany of you have probably read "The Iliad."
p279
aVAchilles surely would have risked his life
p280
aVor given his life to save his friend Patroclus.
p281
aVIn World War II, there were many stories
p282
aVof soldiers who were wounded,
p283
aVwere brought to a rear base hospital,
p284
aVwho went AWOL,
p285
aVcrawled out of windows, slipped out doors,
p286
aVwent AWOL, wounded,
p287
aVto make their way back to the front lines
p288
aVto rejoin their brothers out there.
p289
aVSo you think about Brendan,
p290
aVyou think about all these soldiers
p291
aVhaving an experience like that, a bond like that,
p292
aVin a small group,
p293
aVwhere they loved 20 other people
p294
aVin some ways more than they loved themselves,
p295
aVyou think about how good that would feel, imagine it,
p296
aVand they are blessed with that experience for a year,
p297
aVand then they come home,
p298
aVand they are just back in society
p299
aVlike the rest of us are,
p300
aVnot knowing who they can count on,
p301
aVnot knowing who loves them, who they can love,
p302
aVnot knowing exactly what anyone they know
p303
aVwould do for them if it came down to it.
p304
aVThat is terrifying.
p305
aVCompared to that,
p306
aVwar, psychologically, in some ways, is easy,
p307
aVcompared to that kind of alienation.
p308
aVThat's why they miss it,
p309
aVand that's what we have to understand
p310
aVand in some ways fix in our society.
p311
