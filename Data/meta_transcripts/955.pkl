VIf nothing else, at least I've discovered
p4
aVwhat it is we put our speakers through:
p5
aVsweaty palms, sleepless nights,
p6
aVa wholly unnatural fear of clocks.
p7
aVI mean, it's quite brutal.
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd I'm also a little nervous about this.
p10
aVThere are nine billion humans coming our way.
p11
aVNow, the most optimistic dreams
p12
aVcan get dented by the prospect
p13
aVof people plundering the planet.
p14
aVBut recently, I've become intrigued
p15
aVby a different way of thinking of large human crowds,
p16
aVbecause there are circumstances
p17
aVwhere they can do something really cool.
p18
aVIt's a phenomenon that I think
p19
aVany organization or individual can tap into.
p20
aVIt certainly impacted the way we think about TED's future,
p21
aVand perhaps the world's future overall.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo, let's explore.
p24
aVThe story starts with just a single person,
p25
aVa child, behaving a little strangely.
p26
aVThis kid is known online as Lil Demon.
p27
aVHe's doing tricks here, dance tricks,
p28
aVthat probably no six-year-old in history ever managed before.
p29
aVHow did he learn them?
p30
aVAnd what drove him to spend the hundreds of hours of practice
p31
aVthis must have taken?
p32
aVHere's a clue.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Video) Lil Demon: \u266b Step your game up. Oh. Oh. \u266b
p35
aV\u266b Step your game up. Oh. Oh. \u266b
p36
aa(lp37
VChris Anderson: So, that was sent to me by this man,
p38
aVa filmmaker, Jonathan Chu,
p39
aVwho told me that was the moment he realized
p40
aVthe Internet was causing dance to evolve.
p41
aVThis is what he said at TED in February.
p42
aVIn essence,
p43
aVdancers were challenging each other online to get better;
p44
aVincredible new dance skills were being invented;
p45
aVeven the six-year-olds were joining in.
p46
aVIt felt like a revolution.
p47
aVAnd so Jon had a brilliant idea:
p48
aVHe went out to recruit the best of the best dancers
p49
aVoff of YouTube
p50
aVto create this dance troupe \u2014
p51
aVThe League of Extraordinary Dancers, the LXD.
p52
aVI mean, these kids were web-taught,
p53
aVbut they were so good that they got to play at the Oscars this year.
p54
aVAnd at TED here in February,
p55
aVtheir passion and brilliance just took our breath away.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo, this story
p58
aVof the evolution of dance
p59
aVseems strangely familiar.
p60
aVYou know, a while after TEDTalks started taking off,
p61
aVwe noticed that speakers
p62
aVwere starting to spend a lot more time in preparation.
p63
aVIt was resulting in incredible new talks like these two.
p64
aV... Months of preparation
p65
aVcrammed into 18 minutes,
p66
aVraising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers,
p67
aVwith the effects that we've seen this week.
p68
aVIt's not as if J.J. and Jill
p69
aVactually ended their talks saying, "Step your game up,"
p70
aVbut they might as well have.
p71
aVSo, in both of these cases,
p72
aVyou've got these cycles of improvement,
p73
aVapparently driven
p74
aVby people watching web video.
p75
aa(lp76
VWhat is going on here?
p77
aVWell, I think it's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call
p78
aV"crowd-accelerated innovation."
p79
aVAnd there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear.
p80
aVYou can think of them
p81
aVas three dials on a giant wheel.
p82
aVYou turn up the dials, the wheel starts to turn.
p83
aVAnd the first thing you need is ... a crowd,
p84
aVa group of people who share a common interest.
p85
aVThe bigger the crowd,
p86
aVthe more potential innovators there are.
p87
aVThat's important, but actually most people in the crowd
p88
aVoccupy these other roles.
p89
aVThey're creating the ecosystem
p90
aVfrom which innovation emerges.
p91
aVThe second thing you need is light.
p92
aVYou need clear, open visibility
p93
aVof what the best people in that crowd are capable of,
p94
aVbecause that is how you will learn
p95
aVhow you will be empowered to participate.
p96
aVAnd third, you need desire.
p97
aVYou know, innovation's hard work.
p98
aVIt's based on hundreds of hours of research, of practice.
p99
aVAbsent desire, not going to happen.
p100
aa(lp101
VNow, here's an example \u2014 pre-Internet \u2014
p102
aVof this machine in action.
p103
aVDancers at a street corner \u2014
p104
aVit's a crowd, a small one,
p105
aVbut they can all obviously see what each other can do.
p106
aVAnd the desire part comes, I guess,
p107
aVfrom social status, right?
p108
aVBest dancer walks tall, gets the best date.
p109
aVThere's probably going to be some innovation happening here.
p110
aVBut on the web,
p111
aVall three dials are ratcheted right up.
p112
aVThe dance community is now global.
p113
aVThere's millions connected.
p114
aVAnd amazingly,
p115
aVyou can still see what the best can do,
p116
aVbecause the crowd itself shines a light on them,
p117
aVeither directly, through comments, ratings,
p118
aVemail, Facebook, Twitter,
p119
aVor indirectly,
p120
aVthrough numbers of views,
p121
aVthrough links that point Google there.
p122
aVSo, it's easy to find the good stuff,
p123
aVand when you've found it, you can watch it in close-up repeatedly
p124
aVand read what hundreds of people have written about it.
p125
aVThat's a lot of light.
p126
aa(lp127
VBut the desire element
p128
aVis really dialed way up.
p129
aVI mean, you might just be a kid with a webcam,
p130
aVbut if you can do something that goes viral,
p131
aVyou get to be seen by the equivalent
p132
aVof sports stadiums crammed with people.
p133
aVYou get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you.
p134
aVAnd even if it's not that eloquent \u2014 and it's not \u2014
p135
aVit can still really make your day.
p136
aVSo, this possibility
p137
aVof a new type of global recognition,
p138
aVI think, is driving huge amounts of effort.
p139
aVAnd it's important to note that it's not just the stars who are benefiting:
p140
aVbecause you can see the best, everyone can learn.
p141
aa(lp142
VAlso, the system is self-fueling.
p143
aVIt's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire,
p144
aVbut the light and desire are a lethal one-two combination
p145
aVthat attract new people to the crowd.
p146
aVSo, this is a model
p147
aVthat pretty much any organization could use
p148
aVto try and nurture its own cycle
p149
aVof crowd-accelerated innovation.
p150
aVInvite the crowd, let in the light,
p151
aVdial up the desire.
p152
aVAnd the hardest part about that is probably the light,
p153
aVbecause it means you have to open up,
p154
aVyou have to show your stuff to the world.
p155
aVIt's by giving away what you think is your deepest secret
p156
aVthat maybe millions of people
p157
aVare empowered to help improve it.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd, very happily, there's one class of people
p160
aVwho really can't make use of this tool.
p161
aVThe dark side of the web
p162
aVis allergic to the light.
p163
aVI don't think we're going to see terrorists, for example,
p164
aVpublishing their plans online and saying to the world,
p165
aV"Please, could you help us to actually
p166
aVmake them work this time?"
p167
aa(lp168
VBut you can publish your stuff online.
p169
aVAnd if you can get that wheel to turn,
p170
aVlook out.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo, at TED,
p173
aVwe've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness.
p174
aVIn fact, my colleague, June Cohen, has taken to calling it "radical openness,"
p175
aVbecause it works for us each time.
p176
aVWe opened up our talks to the world,
p177
aVand suddenly there are millions of people out there
p178
aVhelping spread our speakers' ideas,
p179
aVand thereby making it easier for us
p180
aVto recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers.
p181
aVBy opening up our translation program,
p182
aVthousands of heroic volunteers \u2014
p183
aVsome of them watching online right now, and thank you! \u2014
p184
aVhave translated our talks
p185
aVinto more than 70 languages,
p186
aVthereby tripling our viewership in non-English-speaking countries.
p187
aVBy giving away our TEDx brand,
p188
aVwe suddenly have a thousand-plus
p189
aVlive experiments in the art of spreading ideas.
p190
aVAnd these organizers,
p191
aVthey're seeing each other, they're learning from each other.
p192
aVWe are learning from them.
p193
aVWe're getting great talks back from them.
p194
aVThe wheel is turning.
p195
aa(lp196
VOkay, step back a minute.
p197
aVI mean, it's really not news for me to tell you
p198
aVthat innovation emerges out of groups.
p199
aVYou know, we've heard that this week \u2014
p200
aVthis romantic notion of the lone genius
p201
aVwith the "eureka!" moment that changes the world
p202
aVis misleading.
p203
aVEven he said that, and he would know.
p204
aVWe're a social species.
p205
aVWe spark off each other.
p206
aVIt's also not news
p207
aVto say that the Internet has accelerated innovation.
p208
aVFor the past 15 years,
p209
aVpowerful communities have been connecting online,
p210
aVsparking off each other.
p211
aVIf you take programmers,
p212
aVyou know, the whole open-source movement
p213
aVis a fantastic instance of crowd-accelerated innovation.
p214
aVBut what's key here is,
p215
aVthe reason these groups have been able to connect
p216
aVis because their work output is of the type
p217
aVthat can be easily shared digitally \u2014
p218
aVa picture, a music file,
p219
aVsoftware.
p220
aVAnd that's why what I'm excited about,
p221
aVand what I think is under-reported,
p222
aVis the significance of the rise
p223
aVof online video.
p224
aa(lp225
VThis is the technology
p226
aVthat's going to allow the rest of the world's talents to be shared digitally,
p227
aVthereby launching a whole new cycle
p228
aVof crowd-accelerated innovation.
p229
aVThe first few years of the web
p230
aVwere pretty much video-free,
p231
aVfor this reason: video files are huge; the web couldn't handle them.
p232
aVBut in the last 10 years,
p233
aVbandwidth has exploded a hundredfold.
p234
aVSuddenly, here we are.
p235
aVHumanity watches 80 million hours of YouTube every day.
p236
aVCisco actually estimates that, within four years,
p237
aVmore than 90 percent of the web's data will be video.
p238
aVIf it's all puppies, porn and piracy,
p239
aVwe're doomed.
p240
aVI don't think it will be.
p241
aVVideo is high-bandwidth for a reason.
p242
aVIt packs a huge amount of data,
p243
aVand our brains are uniquely wired to decode it.
p244
aa(lp245
VHere, let me introduce you to Sam Haber.
p246
aVHe's a unicyclist.
p247
aVBefore YouTube,
p248
aVthere was no way for him to discover
p249
aVhis sport's true potential,
p250
aVbecause you can't communicate this stuff in words, right?
p251
aVBut looking at video clips posted by strangers,
p252
aVa world of possibility opens up for him.
p253
aVSuddenly, he starts to emulate and then to innovate.
p254
aVAnd a global community of unicyclists discover each other online,
p255
aVinspire each other to greatness.
p256
aVAnd there are thousands of other examples of this happening \u2014
p257
aVof video-driven evolution of skills,
p258
aVranging from the physical to the artful.
p259
aVAnd I have to tell you,
p260
aVas a former publisher of hobbyist magazines,
p261
aVI find this strangely beautiful.
p262
aVI mean, there's a lot of passion right here on this screen.
p263
aa(lp264
VBut if Rube Goldberg machines
p265
aVand video poetry aren't quite your cup of tea,
p266
aVhow about this.
p267
aVJove is a website
p268
aVthat was founded to encourage scientists
p269
aVto publish their peer-reviewed research
p270
aVon video.
p271
aVThere's a problem with a traditional scientific paper.
p272
aVIt can take months for a scientist in another lab
p273
aVto figure out how to replicate the experiments
p274
aVthat are described in print.
p275
aVHere's one such frustrated scientist,
p276
aVMoshe Pritsker, the founder of Jove.
p277
aVHe told me that the world is wasting
p278
aVbillions of dollars on this.
p279
aVBut look at this video.
p280
aVI mean, look: if you can show
p281
aVinstead of just describing,
p282
aVthat problem goes away.
p283
aVSo it's not far-fetched to say
p284
aVthat, at some point,
p285
aVonline video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance.
p286
aa(lp287
VHere's another example
p288
aVthat's close to our hearts at TED,
p289
aVwhere video is sometimes more powerful than print \u2014
p290
aVthe sharing of an idea.
p291
aVWhy do people like watching TEDTalks?
p292
aVAll those ideas are already out there in print.
p293
aVIt's actually faster to read than to view.
p294
aVWhy would someone bother?
p295
aVWell, so, there's some showing as well as telling.
p296
aVBut even leaving the screen out of it,
p297
aVthere's still a lot more being transferred than just words.
p298
aVAnd in that non-verbal portion, there's some serious magic.
p299
aVSomewhere hidden in the physical gestures,
p300
aVthe vocal cadence, the facial expressions,
p301
aVthe eye contact,
p302
aVthe passion,
p303
aVthe kind of awkward, British body language,
p304
aVthe sense of how the audience are reacting,
p305
aVthere are hundreds of subconscious clues
p306
aVthat go to how well you will understand,
p307
aVand whether you're inspired \u2014
p308
aVlight, if you like,
p309
aVand desire.
p310
aVIncredibly, all of this can be communicated
p311
aVon just a few square inches of a screen.
p312
aa(lp313
VReading and writing are actually
p314
aVrelatively recent inventions.
p315
aVFace-to-face communication has been fine-tuned
p316
aVby millions of years of evolution.
p317
aVThat's what's made it into this mysterious, powerful thing it is.
p318
aVSomeone speaks,
p319
aVthere's resonance in all these receiving brains,
p320
aVthe whole group acts together.
p321
aVI mean, this is the connective tissue
p322
aVof the human superorganism in action.
p323
aVIt's probably driven our culture for millennia.
p324
aV500 years ago, it ran into
p325
aVa competitor with a lethal advantage.
p326
aVIt's right here.
p327
aVPrint scaled.
p328
aVThe world's ambitious innovators and influencers
p329
aVnow could get their ideas to spread far and wide,
p330
aVand so the art of the spoken word
p331
aVpretty much withered on the vine.
p332
aVBut now, in the blink of an eye,
p333
aVthe game has changed again.
p334
aVIt's not too much to say
p335
aVthat what Gutenberg did for writing,
p336
aVonline video can now do for face-to-face communication.
p337
aVSo, that primal medium,
p338
aVwhich your brain is exquisitely wired for ...
p339
aVthat just went global.
p340
aa(lp341
VNow, this is big.
p342
aVWe may have to reinvent an ancient art form.
p343
aVI mean, today, one person speaking
p344
aVcan be seen by millions,
p345
aVshedding bright light on potent ideas,
p346
aVcreating intense desire
p347
aVfor learning and to respond \u2014
p348
aVand in his case, intense desire to laugh.
p349
aVFor the first time in human history,
p350
aVtalented students
p351
aVdon't have to have their potential and their dreams
p352
aVwritten out of history by lousy teachers.
p353
aVThey can sit two feet in front of the world's finest.
p354
aa(lp355
VNow, TED is just a small part of this.
p356
aVI mean, the world's universities are opening up their curricula.
p357
aVThousands of individuals and organizations
p358
aVare sharing their knowledge and data online.
p359
aVThousands of people are figuring out new ways
p360
aVto learn and, crucially,
p361
aVto respond, completing the cycle.
p362
aVAnd so, as we've thought about this,
p363
aVyou know, it's become clear to us
p364
aVwhat the next stage of TED's evolution has to be.
p365
aVTEDTalks can't be a one-way process, one-to-many.
p366
aVOur future is many-to-many.
p367
aVSo, we're dreaming of ways
p368
aVto make it easier for you, the global TED community,
p369
aVto respond to speakers,
p370
aVto contribute your own ideas,
p371
aVmaybe even your own TEDTalks,
p372
aVand to help shine a light on the very best of what's out there.
p373
aVBecause, if we can bubble up the very best
p374
aVfrom a vastly larger pool,
p375
aVthis wheel turns.
p376
aa(lp377
VNow, is it possible to imagine
p378
aVa similar process to this,
p379
aVhappening to global education overall?
p380
aVI mean, does it have to be this painful,
p381
aVtop-down process?
p382
aVWhy not a self-fueling cycle
p383
aVin which we all can participate?
p384
aVIt's the participation age, right?
p385
aVSchools can't be silos.
p386
aVWe can't stop learning at age 21.
p387
aVWhat if, in the coming crowd of nine billion ...
p388
aVwhat if that crowd could learn enough
p389
aVto be net contributors,
p390
aVinstead of net plunderers?
p391
aVThat changes everything, right?
p392
aVI mean, that would take more teachers than we've ever had.
p393
aVBut the good news is they are out there.
p394
aVThey're in the crowd,
p395
aVand the crowd is switching on lights,
p396
aVand we can see them for the first time,
p397
aVnot as an undifferentiated mass of strangers,
p398
aVbut as individuals we can learn from.
p399
aVWho's the teacher?
p400
aVYou're the teacher.
p401
aVYou're part of the crowd
p402
aVthat may be about to launch
p403
aVthe biggest learning cycle in human history,
p404
aVa cycle capable of carrying all of us
p405
aVto a smarter, wiser, more beautiful place.
p406
aa(lp407
VHere's a group of kids in a village in Pakistan
p408
aVnear where I grew up.
p409
aVWithin five years, each of these kids is going to have access
p410
aVto a cellphone capable of full-on web video
p411
aVand capable of uploading video to the web.
p412
aVI mean, is it crazy to think that this girl,
p413
aVin the back, at the right, in 15 years,
p414
aVmight be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful
p415
aVfor your grandchildren?
p416
aVIt's not crazy; it's actually happening right now.
p417
aa(lp418

p422
aVI'm one of the organizers of TEDxKibera.
p423
aVThere are so many good things which are happening right here in Kibera.
p424
aVThere's a self-help group.
p425
aVThey turned a trash place into a garden.
p426
aVThe same spot, it was a crime spot
p427
aVwhere people were being robbed.
p428
aVThey used the same trash
p429
aVto form green manure.
p430
aVThe same trash site
p431
aVis feeding more than 30 families.
p432
aVWe have our own film school.
p433
aVThey are using Flip cameras
p434
aVto record, edit,
p435
aVand reporting to their own channel,
p436
aVKibera TV.
p437
aVBecause of a scarcity of land,
p438
aVwe are using the sacks to grow vegetables,
p439
aVand also [we're] able to save on the cost of living.
p440
aVChange happens when we see things in a different way.
p441
aVToday, I see Kibera in a different way.
p442
aVMy message to TEDGlobal
