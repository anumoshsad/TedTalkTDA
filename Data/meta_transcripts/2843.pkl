VWhat's one thing that every person in this room is going to become?
p4
aVOlder.
p5
aVAnd most of us are scared stiff at the prospect.
p6
aVHow does that word make you feel?
p7
aVI used to feel the same way.
p8
aVWhat was I most worried about?
p9
aVEnding up drooling in some grim institutional hallway.
p10
aVAnd then I learned that only four percent of older Americans
p11
aVare living in nursing homes,
p12
aVand the percentage is dropping.
p13
aVWhat else was I worried about?
p14
aVDementia.
p15
aVTurns out that most of us can think just fine to the end.
p16
aVDementia rates are dropping, too.
p17
aVThe real epidemic is anxiety over memory loss.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VI also figured that old people were depressed
p22
aVbecause they were old and they were going to die soon.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VIt turns out that the longer people live,
p27
aVthe less they fear dying,
p28
aVand that people are happiest at the beginnings and the end of their lives.
p29
aVIt's called the U-curve of happiness,
p30
aVand it's been borne out by dozens of studies around the world.
p31
aVYou don't have to be a Buddhist or a billionaire.
p32
aVThe curve is a function of the way aging itself affects the brain.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo I started feeling a lot better about getting older,
p35
aVand I started obsessing about why so few people know these things.
p36
aVThe reason is ageism:
p37
aVdiscrimination and stereotyping on the basis of age.
p38
aVWe experience it anytime someone assumes we're too old for something,
p39
aVinstead of finding out who we are and what we're capable of,
p40
aVor too young.
p41
aVAgeism cuts both ways.
p42
aVAll -isms are socially constructed ideas \u2014 racism, sexism, homophobia \u2014
p43
aVand that means we make them up,
p44
aVand they can change over time.
p45
aVAll these prejudices pit us against each other
p46
aVto maintain the status quo,
p47
aVlike auto workers in the US competing against auto workers in Mexico
p48
aVinstead of organizing for better wages.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Applause)
p51
aa(lp52
VWe know it's not OK to allocate resources by race or by sex.
p53
aVWhy should it be OK to weigh the needs of the young against the old?
p54
aVAll prejudice relies on "othering" \u2014 seeing a group of people
p55
aVas other than ourselves:
p56
aVother race, other religion, other nationality.
p57
aVThe strange thing about ageism:
p58
aVthat other is us.
p59
aVAgeism feeds on denial \u2014 our reluctance to acknowledge
p60
aVthat we are going to become that older person.
p61
aVIt's denial when we try to pass for younger
p62
aVor when we believe in anti-aging products,
p63
aVor when we feel like our bodies are betraying us,
p64
aVsimply because they are changing.
p65
aVWhy on earth do we stop celebrating the ability to adapt and grow
p66
aVas we move through life?
p67
aVWhy should aging well mean struggling to look and move
p68
aVlike younger versions of ourselves?
p69
aVIt's embarrassing to be called out as older
p70
aVuntil we quit being embarrassed about it,
p71
aVand it's not healthy to go through life dreading our futures.
p72
aVThe sooner we get off this hamster wheel of age denial,
p73
aVthe better off we are.
p74
aa(lp75
VStereotypes are always a mistake, of course,
p76
aVbut especially when it comes to age,
p77
aVbecause the longer we live,
p78
aVthe more different from one another we become.
p79
aVRight? Think about it.
p80
aVAnd yet, we tend to think of everyone in a retirement home
p81
aVas the same age: old \u2014
p82
aa(lp83
V(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
Vwhen they can span four decades.
p86
aVCan you imagine thinking that way about a group of people
p87
aVbetween the ages of 20 and 60?
p88
aa(lp89
VWhen you get to a party, do you head for people your own age?
p90
aVHave you ever grumbled about entitled millennials?
p91
aVHave you ever rejected a haircut or a relationship or an outing
p92
aVbecause it's not age-appropriate?
p93
aVFor adults, there's no such thing.
p94
aVAll these behaviors are ageist.
p95
aVWe all do them,
p96
aVand we can't challenge bias unless we're aware of it.
p97
aVNobody's born ageist,
p98
aVbut it starts at early childhood,
p99
aVaround the same time attitudes towards race and gender start to form,
p100
aVbecause negative messages about late life bombard us
p101
aVfrom the media and popular culture at every turn.
p102
aVRight? Wrinkles are ugly.
p103
aVOld people are pathetic.
p104
aVIt's sad to be old.
p105
aa(lp106
VLook at Hollywood.
p107
aVA survey of recent Best Picture nominations
p108
aVfound that only 12 percent of speaking or named characters
p109
aVwere age 60 and up,
p110
aVand many of them were portrayed as impaired.
p111
aVOlder people can be the most ageist of all,
p112
aVbecause we've had a lifetime to internalize these messages
p113
aVand we've never thought to challenge them.
p114
aVI had to acknowledge it
p115
aVand stop colluding.
p116
aV"Senior moment" quips, for example:
p117
aVI stopped making them when it dawned on me
p118
aVthat when I lost the car keys in high school,
p119
aVI didn't call it a "junior moment."
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VI stopped blaming my sore knee on being 64.
p124
aVMy other knee doesn't hurt,
p125
aVand it's just as old.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
V(Applause)
p130
aa(lp131
VWe are all worried about some aspect of getting older,
p132
aVwhether running out of money,
p133
aVgetting sick, ending up alone,
p134
aVand those fears are legitimate and real.
p135
aVBut what never dawns on most of us
p136
aVis that the experience of reaching old age
p137
aVcan be better or worse depending on the culture
p138
aVin which it takes place.
p139
aVIt is not having a vagina that makes life harder for women.
p140
aVIt's sexism.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Applause)
p143
aa(lp144
VIt's not loving a man that makes life harder for gay guys.
p145
aVIt's homophobia.
p146
aVAnd it is not the passage of time that makes getting older
p147
aVso much harder than it has to be.
p148
aVIt is ageism.
p149
aVWhen labels are hard to read
p150
aVor there's no handrail
p151
aVor we can't open the damn jar,
p152
aVwe blame ourselves,
p153
aVour failure to age successfully,
p154
aVinstead of the ageism that makes those natural transitions shameful
p155
aVand the discrimination that makes those barriers acceptable.
p156
aVYou can't make money off satisfaction,
p157
aVbut shame and fear create markets,
p158
aVand capitalism always needs new markets.
p159
aVWho says wrinkles are ugly?
p160
aVThe multi-billion-dollar skin care industry.
p161
aVWho says perimenopause and low T and mild cognitive impairment
p162
aVare medical conditions?
p163
aVThe trillion-dollar pharmaceutical industry.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Cheers)
p166
aa(lp167
VThe more clearly we see these forces at work,
p168
aVthe easier it is to come up with alternative, more positive
p169
aVand more accurate narratives.
p170
aVAging is not a problem to be fixed or a disease to be cured.
p171
aVIt is a natural, powerful, lifelong process that unites us all.
p172
aa(lp173
VChanging the culture is a tall order, I know that, but culture is fluid.
p174
aVLook at how much the position of women has changed in my lifetime
p175
aVor the incredible strides that the gay rights movement
p176
aVhas made in just a few decades, right?
p177
aa(lp178
V(Applause)
p179
aa(lp180
VLook at gender.
p181
aVWe used to think of it as a binary, male or female,
p182
aVand now we understand it's a spectrum.
p183
aVIt is high time to ditch the old-young binary, too.
p184
aVThere is no line in the sand between old and young,
p185
aVafter which it's all downhill.
p186
aVAnd the longer we wait to challenge that idea,
p187
aVthe more damage it does to ourselves and our place in the world,
p188
aVlike in the workforce, where age discrimination is rampant.
p189
aVIn Silicon Valley, engineers are getting Botoxed and hair-plugged
p190
aVbefore key interviews \u2014
p191
aVand these are skilled white men in their 30s,
p192
aVso imagine the effects further down the food chain.
p193
aa(lp194
V(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VThe personal and economic consequences are devastating.
p197
aVNot one stereotype about older workers holds up under scrutiny.
p198
aVCompanies aren't adaptable and creative because their employees are young;
p199
aVthey're adaptable and creative despite it.
p200
aVCompanies \u2014
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
V(Applause)
p205
aa(lp206
VWe know that diverse companies aren't just better places to work;
p207
aVthey work better.
p208
aVAnd just like race and sex, age is a criterion for diversity.
p209
aa(lp210
VA growing body of fascinating research
p211
aVshows that attitudes towards aging
p212
aVaffect how our minds and bodies function at the cellular level.
p213
aVWhen we talk to older people like this (Speaks more loudly)
p214
aVor call them "sweetie" or "young lady" \u2014
p215
aVit's called elderspeak \u2014
p216
aVthey appear to instantly age,
p217
aVwalking and talking less competently.
p218
aVPeople with more positive feelings towards aging
p219
aVwalk faster,
p220
aVthey do better on memory tests,
p221
aVthey heal quicker, and they live longer.
p222
aVEven with brains full of plaques and tangles,
p223
aVsome people stayed sharp to the end.
p224
aVWhat did they have in common?
p225
aVA sense of purpose.
p226
aVAnd what's the biggest obstacle to having a sense of purpose in late life?
p227
aVA culture that tells us that getting older means shuffling offstage.
p228
aVThat's why the World Health Organization is developing
p229
aVa global anti-ageism initiative
p230
aVto extend not just life span but health span.
p231
aa(lp232
VWomen experience the double whammy
p233
aVof ageism and sexism,
p234
aVso we experience aging differently.
p235
aVThere's a double standard at work here \u2014 shocker \u2014
p236
aa(lp237
V(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
Vthe notion that aging enhances men and devalues women.
p240
aVWomen reinforce this double standard when we compete to stay young,
p241
aVanother punishing and losing proposition.
p242
aVDoes any woman in this room really believe
p243
aVthat she is a lesser version \u2014
p244
aVless interesting, less fun in bed, less valuable \u2014
p245
aVthan the woman she once was?
p246
aVThis discrimination affects our health,
p247
aVour well-being and our income,
p248
aVand the effects add up over time.
p249
aVThey are further compounded by race and by class,
p250
aVwhich is why, everywhere in the world,
p251
aVthe poorest of the poor are old women of color.
p252
aa(lp253
VWhat's the takeaway from that map?
p254
aVBy 2050, one out of five of us,
p255
aValmost two billion people,
p256
aVwill be age 60 and up.
p257
aVLongevity is a fundamental hallmark of human progress.
p258
aVAll these older people represent a vast unprecedented and untapped market.
p259
aVAnd yet, capitalism and urbanization have propelled age bias
p260
aVinto every corner of the globe,
p261
aVfrom Switzerland, where elders fare the best,
p262
aVto Afghanistan, which sits at the bottom of the Global AgeWatch Index.
p263
aVHalf of the world's countries aren't mentioned on that list
p264
aVbecause we don't bother to collect data on millions of people
p265
aVbecause they're no longer young.
p266
aVAlmost two-thirds of people over 60 around the world
p267
aVsay they have trouble accessing healthcare.
p268
aVAlmost three-quarters say their income doesn't cover basic services
p269
aVlike food, water, electricity, and decent housing.
p270
aVIs this the world we want our children, who may well live to be a hundred,
p271
aVto inherit?
p272
aVEveryone \u2014 all ages, all genders, all nationalities \u2014
p273
aVis old or future-old,
p274
aVand unless we put an end to it, ageism will oppress us all.
p275
aVAnd that makes it a perfect target for collective advocacy.
p276
aa(lp277
VWhy add another -ism to the list when so many, racism in particular,
p278
aVcall out for action?
p279
aVHere's the thing:
p280
aVwe don't have to choose.
p281
aVWhen we make the world a better place to grow old in,
p282
aVwe make it a better place in which to be from somewhere else,
p283
aVto have a disability,
p284
aVto be queer, to be non-rich, to be non-white.
p285
aVAnd when we show up at all ages for whatever cause matters most to us \u2014
p286
aVsave the whales, save the democracy \u2014
p287
aVwe not only make that effort more effective,
p288
aVwe dismantle ageism in the process.
p289
aa(lp290
VLongevity is here to stay.
p291
aVA movement to end ageism is underway.
p292
aVI'm in it, and I hope you will join me.
