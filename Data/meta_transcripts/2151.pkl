VI was on a long road trip this summer,
p4
aVand I was having a wonderful time listening
p5
aVto the amazing Isabel Wilkerson's "The Warmth of Other Suns."
p6
aVIt documents six million black folks fleeing the South from 1915 to 1970
p7
aVlooking for a respite from all the brutality
p8
aVand trying to get to a better opportunity up North,
p9
aVand it was filled with stories of the resilience and the brilliance
p10
aVof African-Americans,
p11
aVand it was also really hard to hear all the stories of the horrors
p12
aVand the humility, and all the humiliations.
p13
aVIt was especially hard to hear about the beatings and the burnings
p14
aVand the lynchings of black men.
p15
aVAnd I said, "You know, this is a little deep.
p16
aVI need a break. I'm going to turn on the radio."
p17
aVI turned it on, and there it was:
p18
aVFerguson, Missouri,
p19
aVMichael Brown,
p20
aV18-year-old black man,
p21
aVunarmed, shot by a white police officer, laid on the ground dead,
p22
aVblood running for four hours
p23
aVwhile his grandmother and little children and his neighbors watched in horror,
p24
aVand I thought,
p25
aVhere it is again.
p26
aVThis violence, this brutality against black men
p27
aVhas been going on for centuries.
p28
aVI mean, it's the same story. It's just different names.
p29
aVIt could have been Amadou Diallo.
p30
aVIt could have been Sean Bell.
p31
aVIt could have been Oscar Grant.
p32
aVIt could have been Trayvon Martin.
p33
aa(lp34
VThis violence, this brutality,
p35
aVis really something that's part of our national psyche.
p36
aVIt's part of our collective history.
p37
aVWhat are we going to do about it?
p38
aVYou know that part of us that still crosses the street,
p39
aVlocks the doors,
p40
aVclutches the purses,
p41
aVwhen we see young black men?
p42
aVThat part.
p43
aa(lp44
VI mean, I know we're not shooting people down in the street,
p45
aVbut I'm saying that the same stereotypes and prejudices
p46
aVthat fuel those kinds of tragic incidents
p47
aVare in us.
p48
aVWe've been schooled in them as well.
p49
aVI believe that we can stop these types of incidents,
p50
aVthese Fergusons from happening,
p51
aVby looking within and being willing to change ourselves.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo I have a call to action for you.
p54
aVThere are three things that I want to offer us today to think about
p55
aVas ways to stop Ferguson from happening again;
p56
aVthree things that I think will help us
p57
aVreform our images of young black men;
p58
aVthree things that I'm hoping will not only protect them
p59
aVbut will open the world so that they can thrive.
p60
aVCan you imagine that?
p61
aVCan you imagine our country embracing young black men,
p62
aVseeing them as part of our future, giving them that kind of openness,
p63
aVthat kind of grace we give to people we love?
p64
aVHow much better would our lives be? How much better would our country be?
p65
aa(lp66
VLet me just start with number one.
p67
aVWe gotta get out of denial.
p68
aVStop trying to be good people.
p69
aVWe need real people.
p70
aVYou know, I do a lot of diversity work,
p71
aVand people will come up to me at the beginning of the workshop.
p72
aVThey're like, "Oh, Ms. Diversity Lady, we're so glad you're here" \u2014
p73
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p74
aV"but we don't have a biased bone  in our body."
p75
aVAnd I'm like, "Really?
p76
aVBecause I do this work every day, and I see all my biases."
p77
aa(lp78
VI mean, not too long ago, I was on a plane
p79
aVand I heard the voice of a woman pilot coming over the P.A. system,
p80
aVand I was just so excited, so thrilled.
p81
aVI was like, "Yes, women, we are rocking it.
p82
aVWe are now in the stratosphere."
p83
aVIt was all good, and then it started getting turbulent and bumpy,
p84
aVand I was like,
p85
aV"I hope she can drive."
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aVI know. Right.
p88
aVBut it's not even like I knew that was a bias
p89
aVuntil I was coming back on the other leg and there's always a guy driving
p90
aVand it's often turbulent and bumpy,
p91
aVand I've never questioned the confidence of the male driver.
p92
aVThe pilot is good.
p93
aVNow, here's the problem.
p94
aVIf you ask me explicitly, I would say, "Female pilot: awesome."
p95
aVBut it appears that when things get funky and a little troublesome, a little risky,
p96
aVI lean on a bias that I didn't even know that I had.
p97
aVYou know, fast-moving planes in the sky,
p98
aVI want a guy.
p99
aVThat's my default.
p100
aVMen are my default.
p101
aVWho is your default?
p102
aVWho do you trust?
p103
aVWho are you afraid of?
p104
aVWho do you implicitly feel connected to?
p105
aVWho do you run away from?
p106
aa(lp107
VI'm going to tell you what we have learned.
p108
aVThe implicit association test, which measures unconscious bias,
p109
aVyou can go online and take it.
p110
aVFive million people have taken it.
p111
aVTurns out, our default is white. We like white people.
p112
aVWe prefer white. What do I mean by that?
p113
aVWhen people are shown images  of black men and white men,
p114
aVwe are more quickly able to associate
p115
aVthat picture with a positive word, that white person with a positive word,
p116
aVthan we are when we are  trying to associate
p117
aVpositive with a black face, and vice versa.
p118
aVWhen we see a black face,
p119
aVit is easier for us to connect black with negative
p120
aVthan it is white with negative.
p121
aVSeventy percent of white people taking that test prefer white.
p122
aVFifty percent of black people taking that test prefer white.
p123
aVYou see, we were all outside when the contamination came down.
p124
aa(lp125
VWhat do we do about the fact that our brain automatically associates?
p126
aVYou know, one of the things that you probably are thinking about,
p127
aVand you're probably like, you know what,
p128
aVI'm just going to double down on my color blindness.
p129
aVYes, I'm going to recommit to that.
p130
aVI'm going to suggest to you, no.
p131
aVWe've gone about as far as we can go trying to make a difference
p132
aVtrying to not see color.
p133
aVThe problem was never that we saw color. It was what we did when we saw the color.
p134
aVIt's a false ideal.
p135
aVAnd while we're busy  pretending not to see,
p136
aVwe are not being aware of the ways in which racial difference
p137
aVis changing people's possibilities, that's keeping them from thriving,
p138
aVand sometimes it's causing them an early death.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo in fact, what the scientists are telling us is, no way.
p141
aVDon't even think about color blindness.
p142
aVIn fact, what they're suggesting is,
p143
aVstare at awesome black people.
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aVLook at them directly in their faces and memorize them,
p146
aVbecause when we look at awesome folks who are black,
p147
aVit helps to dissociate
p148
aVthe association that happens automatically in our brain.
p149
aVWhy do you think I'm showing you these beautiful black men behind me?
p150
aVThere were so many, I had to cut them.
p151
aVOkay, so here's the thing:
p152
aVI'm trying to reset your automatic associations about who black men are.
p153
aVI'm trying to remind you
p154
aVthat young black men grow up to be amazing human beings
p155
aVwho have changed our lives and made them better.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo here's the thing.
p158
aVThe other possibility in science,
p159
aVand it's only temporarily changing our automatic assumptions,
p160
aVbut one thing we know
p161
aVis that if you take a white person who is odious that you know,
p162
aVand stick it up next to a person of color,
p163
aVa black person, who is fabulous,
p164
aVthen that sometimes actually causes us to disassociate too.
p165
aVSo think Jeffrey Dahmer and Colin Powell.
p166
aVJust stare at them, right? (Laughter)
p167
aVBut these are the things. So go looking for your bias.
p168
aVPlease, please, just get out of denial and go looking for disconfirming data
p169
aVthat will prove that in fact your old stereotypes are wrong.
p170
aa(lp171
VOkay, so that's number one: number two,
p172
aVwhat I'm going to say is move toward young black men instead of away from them.
p173
aVIt's not the hardest thing to do,
p174
aVbut it's also one of these things
p175
aVwhere you have to be conscious  and intentional about it.
p176
aVYou know, I was in a Wall Street area  one time several years ago
p177
aVwhen I was with a colleague of mine, and she's really wonderful
p178
aVand she does diversity work with me and she's a woman of color, she's Korean.
p179
aVAnd we were outside, it was late at night,
p180
aVand we were sort of wondering where we were going, we were lost.
p181
aVAnd I saw this person across the street, and I was thinking, "Oh great, black guy."
p182
aVI was going toward him without even thinking about it.
p183
aVAnd she was like, "Oh, that's interesting."
p184
aVThe guy across the street, he was a black guy.
p185
aVI think black guys generally know where they're going.
p186
aVI don't know why exactly I think that, but that's what I think.
p187
aVSo she was saying, "Oh, you were going, 'Yay, a black guy'?"
p188
aVShe said, "I was going, 'Ooh, a black guy.'"
p189
aVOther direction. Same need, same guy, same clothes,
p190
aVsame time, same street, different reaction.
p191
aVAnd she said, "I feel so bad. I'm a diversity consultant.
p192
aVI did the black guy thing. I'm a woman of color. Oh my God!"
p193
aVAnd I said, "You know what? Please. We really need to relax about this."
p194
aVI mean, you've got to realize I go way back with black guys.
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aVMy dad is a black guy. You see what I'm saying?
p197
aVI've got a 6'5" black guy son. I was married to a black guy.
p198
aVMy black guy thing is so wide and so deep
p199
aVthat I can pretty much sort and figure out who that black guy is,
p200
aVand he was my black guy.
p201
aVHe said, "Yes, ladies, I know where you're going. I'll take you there."
p202
aa(lp203
VYou know, biases are the stories we make up about people
p204
aVbefore we know who they actually are.
p205
aVBut how are we going to know who they are
p206
aVwhen we've been told to avoid and be afraid of them?
p207
aVSo I'm going to tell you to walk toward your discomfort.
p208
aVAnd I'm not asking you to take any crazy risks.
p209
aVI'm saying, just do an inventory,
p210
aVexpand your social and professional circles.
p211
aVWho's in your circle?
p212
aVWho's missing?
p213
aVHow many authentic relationships
p214
aVdo you have with young black people, folks, men, women?
p215
aVOr any other major difference from who you are
p216
aVand how you roll, so to speak?
p217
aVBecause, you know what? Just look around your periphery.
p218
aVThere may be somebody at work, in your classroom,
p219
aVin your house of worship, somewhere, there's some black young guy there.
p220
aVAnd you're nice. You say hi.
p221
aVI'm saying go deeper, closer, further, and build the kinds of relationships,
p222
aVthe kinds of friendships that actually cause you to see the holistic person
p223
aVand to really go against the stereotypes.
p224
aVI know some of you are out there,
p225
aa(lp226
VI know because I have some white friends in particular that will say,
p227
aV"You have no idea how awkward I am.
p228
aVLike, I don't think this is going to work for me.
p229
aVI'm sure I'm going to blow this."
p230
aVOkay, maybe, but this thing is not  about perfection. It's about connection.
p231
aVAnd you're not going to get comfortable before you get uncomfortable.
p232
aVI mean, you just have to do it.
p233
aVAnd young black men, what I'm saying is
p234
aVif someone comes your way, genuinely and authentically, take the invitation.
p235
aVNot everyone is out to get you.
p236
aVGo looking for those people who can see your humanity.
p237
aVYou know, it's the empathy and the compassion
p238
aVthat comes out of having relationships with people who are different from you.
p239
aVSomething really powerful and beautiful happens:
p240
aVyou start to realize that they are you,
p241
aVthat they are part of you, that they are you in your family,
p242
aVand then we cease to be bystanders
p243
aVand we become actors, we become advocates,
p244
aVand we become allies.
p245
aVSo go away from your comfort into a bigger, brighter thing,
p246
aVbecause that is how we will stop another Ferguson from happening.
p247
aVThat's how we create a community
p248
aVwhere everybody, especially young black men, can thrive.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo this last thing is going to be harder,
p251
aVand I know it, but I'm just going to put it out there anyway.
p252
aVWhen we see something, we have to have the courage to say something,
p253
aVeven to the people we love.
p254
aVYou know, it's holidays and it's going to be a time
p255
aVwhen we're sitting around the table and having a good time.
p256
aVMany of us, anyways, will be in holidays,
p257
aVand you've got to listen to the conversations around the table.
p258
aVYou start to say things like, "Grandma's a bigot."
p259
aV(Laughter)
p260
aV"Uncle Joe is racist."
p261
aVAnd you know, we love Grandma and we love Uncle Joe. We do.
p262
aVWe know they're good people, but what they're saying is wrong.
p263
aVAnd we need to be able to say something, because you know who else is at the table?
p264
aVThe children are at the table.
p265
aVAnd we wonder why these biases don't die, and move from generation to generation?
p266
aVBecause we're not saying anything.
p267
aVWe've got to be willing to say, "Grandma, we don't call people that anymore."
p268
aV"Uncle Joe, it isn't true that he deserved that.
p269
aVNo one deserves that."
p270
aVAnd we've got to be willing
p271
aVto not shelter our children from the ugliness of racism
p272
aVwhen black parents don't have the luxury to do so,
p273
aVespecially those who have  young black sons.
p274
aVWe've got to take  our lovely darlings, our future,
p275
aVand we've got to tell them we have  an amazing country with incredible ideals,
p276
aVwe have worked incredibly hard, and we have made some progress,
p277
aVbut we are not done.
p278
aVWe still have in us this old stuff
p279
aVabout superiority and it is causing us
p280
aVto embed those further into our institutions
p281
aVand our society and generations,
p282
aVand it is making for despair
p283
aVand disparities and a devastating devaluing of young black men.
p284
aVWe still struggle, you have to tell them,
p285
aVwith seeing both the color
p286
aVand the character of young black men,
p287
aVbut that you, and you expect them,
p288
aVto be part of the forces of change in this society
p289
aVthat will stand against injustice and is willing, above all other things,
p290
aVto make a society where young black men  can be seen for all of who they are.
p291
aa(lp292
VSo many amazing black men,
p293
aVthose who are the most amazing statesmen that have ever lived,
p294
aVbrave soldiers,
p295
aVawesome, hardworking laborers.
p296
aVThese are people who are powerful preachers.
p297
aVThey are incredible scientists and artists and writers.
p298
aVThey are dynamic comedians.
p299
aVThey are doting grandpas,
p300
aVcaring sons.
p301
aVThey are strong fathers,
p302
aVand they are young men with dreams of their own.
p303
