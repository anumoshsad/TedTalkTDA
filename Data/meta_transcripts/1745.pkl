VSergey Brin: Oh, sorry, I just got this message from a Nigerian prince.
p51
aVHe needs help getting 10 million dollars.
p52
aVI like to pay attention to these
p53
aVbecause that's how we originally funded the company,
p54
aVand it's gone pretty well.
p55
aa(lp56
VThough in all seriousness,
p57
aVthis position that you just saw me in,
p58
aVlooking down at my phone,
p59
aVthat's one of the reasons behind this project, Project Glass.
p60
aVBecause we ultimately questioned
p61
aVwhether this is the ultimate future
p62
aVof how you want to connect to other people in your life,
p63
aVhow you want to connect to information.
p64
aVShould it be by just walking around looking down?
p65
aVBut that was the vision behind Glass,
p66
aVand that's why we've created this form factor.
p67
aVOkay. And I don't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot,
p68
aVbut I want to tell you a little bit more
p69
aVabout the motivation behind what led to it.
p70
aVIn addition to potentially socially isolating yourself
p71
aVwhen you're out and about looking at your phone,
p72
aVit's kind of, is this what you're meant to do with your body?
p73
aVYou're standing around there
p74
aVand you're just rubbing
p75
aVthis featureless piece of glass.
p76
aVYou're just kind of moving around.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo when we developed Glass, we thought really about,
p79
aVcan we make something that frees your hands?
p80
aVYou saw all of the things people are doing
p81
aVin the video back there.
p82
aVThey were all wearing Glass,
p83
aVand that's how we got that footage.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd also you want something that frees your eyes.
p86
aVThat's why we put the display up high,
p87
aVout of your line of sight,
p88
aVso it wouldn't be where you're looking
p89
aVand it wouldn't be where you're making
p90
aVeye contact with people.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd also we wanted to free up the ears,
p93
aVso the sound actually goes through,
p94
aVconducts straight to the bones in your cranium,
p95
aVwhich is a little bit freaky at first, but you get used to it.
p96
aVAnd ironically, if you want to hear it better,
p97
aVyou actually just cover your ear,
p98
aVwhich is kind of surprising, but that's how it works.
p99
aa(lp100
VMy vision when we started Google 15 years ago
p101
aVwas that eventually you wouldn't
p102
aVhave to have a search query at all.
p103
aVYou'd just have information come to you as you needed it.
p104
aVAnd this is now, 15 years later,
p105
aVsort of the first form factor
p106
aVthat I think can deliver that vision
p107
aVwhen you're out and about on the street
p108
aVtalking to people and so forth.
p109
aa(lp110
VThis project has lasted now, been just over two years.
p111
aVWe've learned an amazing amount.
p112
aVIt's been really important to make it comfortable.
p113
aVSo our first prototypes we built were huge.
p114
aVIt was like cell phones strapped to your head.
p115
aVIt was very heavy, pretty uncomfortable.
p116
aVWe had to keep it secret from our industrial designer
p117
aVuntil she actually accepted the job,
p118
aVand then she almost ran away screaming.
p119
aVBut we've come a long way.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd the other really unexpected surprise was the camera.
p122
aVOur original prototypes didn't have cameras at all,
p123
aVbut it's been really magical to be able to capture moments
p124
aVspent with my family, my kids.
p125
aVI just never would have dug out a camera
p126
aVor a phone or something else to take that moment.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd lastly I've realized, in experimenting with this device,
p129
aVthat I also kind of have a nervous tic.
p130
aVThe cell phone is \u2014 yeah, you have to look down on it and all that,
p131
aVbut it's also kind of a nervous habit.
p132
aVLike if I smoked, I'd probably just smoke instead.
p133
aVI would just light up a cigarette. It would look cooler.
p134
aVYou know, I'd be like \u2014
p135
aVBut in this case, you know, I whip this out
p136
aVand I sit there and look as if I have something
p137
aVvery important to do or attend to.
p138
aVBut it really opened my eyes to how much of my life
p139
aVI spent just secluding away,
p140
aVbe it email or social posts or whatnot,
p141
aVeven though it wasn't really \u2014
p142
aVthere's nothing really that important or that pressing.
p143
aVAnd with this, I know I will get certain messages
p144
aVif I really need them,
p145
aVbut I don't have to be checking them all the time.
p146
aa(lp147
VYeah, I've really enjoyed actually exploring the world more,
p148
aVdoing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video.
p149
aa(lp150
VThank you all very much.
