VGood morning everybody.
p4
aVI'd like to talk about a couple of things today.
p5
aVThe first thing is water.
p6
aVNow I see you've all been enjoying the water
p7
aVthat's been provided for you here at the conference,
p8
aVover the past couple of days.
p9
aVAnd I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source.
p10
aa(lp11
VBut what if it wasn't?
p12
aVWhat if it was from a source like this?
p13
aVThen statistics would actually say
p14
aVthat half of you would now be suffering
p15
aVwith diarrhea.
p16
aVI talked a lot in the past about statistics,
p17
aVand the provision of safe drinking water for all.
p18
aVBut they just don't seem to get through.
p19
aVAnd I think I've worked out why.
p20
aVIt's because, using current thinking,
p21
aVthe scale of the problem
p22
aVjust seems too huge to contemplate solving.
p23
aVSo we just switch off:
p24
aVus, governments and aid agencies.
p25
aVWell, today, I'd like to show you
p26
aVthat through thinking differently,
p27
aVthe problem has been solved.
p28
aVBy the way, since I've been speaking,
p29
aVanother 13,000 people around the world
p30
aVare suffering now with diarrhea.
p31
aVAnd four children have just died.
p32
aa(lp33
VI invented Lifesaver bottle
p34
aVbecause I got angry.
p35
aVI, like most of you, was sitting down, the day after Christmas in 2004,
p36
aVwhen I was watching the devastating news
p37
aVof the Asian tsunami as it rolled in,
p38
aVplaying out on TV.
p39
aVThe days and weeks that followed,
p40
aVpeople fleeing to the hills,
p41
aVbeing forced to drink contaminated water
p42
aVor face death.
p43
aVThat really stuck with me.
p44
aVThen, a few months later,
p45
aVHurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America.
p46
aV"Okay," I thought, "here's a First World country, let's see what they can do."
p47
aVDay one: nothing.
p48
aVDay two: nothing.
p49
aVDo you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome?
p50
aVPeople were shooting each other on the streets
p51
aVfor TV sets and water.
p52
aVThat's when I decided I had to do something.
p53
aa(lp54
VNow I spent a lot of time in my garage, over the next weeks and months,
p55
aVand also in my kitchen \u2014 much to the dismay of my wife. (Laughter)
p56
aVHowever, after a few failed prototypes,
p57
aVI finally came up with this, the Lifesaver bottle.
p58
aa(lp59
VOkay, now for the science bit.
p60
aVBefore Lifesaver, the best hand filters were only capable
p61
aVof filtering down to about 200 nanometers.
p62
aVThe smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers.
p63
aVSo a 200-nanometer bacteria
p64
aVis going to get through a 200-nanometer hole.
p65
aVThe smallest virus, on the other hand,
p66
aVis about 25 nanometers.
p67
aVSo that's definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes.
p68
aVLifesaver pores are 15 nanometers.
p69
aVSo nothing is getting through.
p70
aa(lp71
VOkay, I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration.
p72
aVWould you like to see that?
p73
aVI spent all the time setting this up, so I guess I should.
p74
aVWe're in the fine city of Oxford.
p75
aVSo \u2014 someone's done that up.
p76
aVFine city of Oxford, so what I've done is I've gone
p77
aVand got some water from the River Cherwell,
p78
aVand the River Thames,
p79
aVthat flow through here. And this is the water.
p80
aVBut I got to thinking, you know,
p81
aVif we were in the middle of a flood zone
p82
aVin Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this.
p83
aVSo I've gone and got some stuff to add into it.
p84
aVAnd this is from my pond.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Sniffs) (Coughs) Have a smell of that, mister cameraman.
p87
aa(lp88
VOkay. (Laughs) Right.
p89
aVWe're just going to pour that in there.
p90
aa(lp91
VAudience: Ugh!
p92
aa(lp93
VMichael Pritchard: Okay. We've got some runoff
p94
aVfrom a sewage plant farm.
p95
aVSo I'm just going to put that in there.
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVPut that in there. There we go.
p98
aV(Laughter)
p99
aVAnd some other bits and pieces, chuck that in there.
p100
aVAnd I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit.
p101
aVSo we're just going to put that in there as well.
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aVOkay. (Laughter) Now.
p104
aa(lp105
VThe Lifesaver bottle works really simply.
p106
aVYou just scoop the water up.
p107
aVToday I'm going to use a jug
p108
aVjust to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there.
p109
aVThat's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit.
p110
aVOkay, so I'm going to take this really filthy water,
p111
aVand put it in here. Do you want a drink yet?
p112
aV(Laughter)
p113
aVOkay. There we go.
p114
aVReplace the top.
p115
aVGive it a few pumps. Okay?
p116
aVThat's all that's necessary.
p117
aVNow as soon as I pop the teat,
p118
aVsterile drinking water is going to come out.
p119
aVI've got to be quick. Okay, ready?
p120
aVThere we go. Mind the electrics.
p121
aVThat is safe, sterile drinking water.
p122
aV(Applause)
p123
aVCheers.
p124
aV(Applause)
p125
aVThere you go Chris.
p126
aV(Applause)
p127
aVWhat's it taste of?
p128
aa(lp129
VChris Anderson: Delicious.
p130
aa(lp131
VMichael Pritchard: Okay.
p132
aVLet's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay?
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VOkay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world.
p136
aVIt'll last for 6,000 liters.
p137
aVAnd when it's expired, using failsafe technology,
p138
aVthe system will shut off, protecting the user.
p139
aVPop the cartridge out. Pop a new one in.
p140
aVIt's good for another 6,000 liters.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo let's look at the applications.
p143
aVTraditionally, in a crisis, what do we do?
p144
aVWe ship water.
p145
aVThen, after a few weeks, we set up camps.
p146
aVAnd people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water.
p147
aVWhat happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp?
p148
aVDiseases spread. More resources are required.
p149
aVThe problem just becomes self-perpetuating.
p150
aVBut by thinking differently,
p151
aVand shipping these,
p152
aVpeople can stay put.
p153
aVThey can make their own sterile drinking water,
p154
aVand start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives.
p155
aa(lp156
VNow, it doesn't require a natural disaster
p157
aVfor this to work.
p158
aVUsing the old thinking, of national infrastructure
p159
aVand pipe work, is too expensive.
p160
aVWhen you run the numbers on a calculator,
p161
aVyou run out of noughts.
p162
aVSo here is the "thinking different" bit.
p163
aa(lp164
VInstead of shipping water,
p165
aVand using man-made processes to do it,
p166
aVlet's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system.
p167
aVShe picks the water up from there,
p168
aVdesalinates it, for free, transports it over there,
p169
aVand dumps it onto the mountains, rivers, and streams.
p170
aVAnd where do people live? Near water.
p171
aVAll we've go to do
p172
aVis make it sterile. How do we do that?
p173
aa(lp174
VWell, we could use the Lifesaver bottle.
p175
aVOr we could use one of these.
p176
aVThe same technology, in a jerry can.
p177
aVThis will process 25,000 liters of water;
p178
aVthat's good enough for a family of four,
p179
aVfor three years.
p180
aVAnd how much does it cost?
p181
aVAbout half a cent a day to run.
p182
aVThank you.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Applause)
p185
aa(lp186
VSo, by thinking differently, and processing water
p187
aVat the point of use,
p188
aVmothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day
p189
aVto collect their water.
p190
aVThey can get it from a source nearby.
p191
aVSo with just eight billion dollars,
p192
aVwe can hit the millennium goal's target
p193
aVof halving the number of people
p194
aVwithout access to safe drinking water.
p195
aVTo put that into context,
p196
aVThe U.K. government spends about 12 billion pounds
p197
aVa year on foreign aid.
p198
aVBut why stop there?
p199
aVWith 20 billion dollars, everyone can have access to safe drinking water.
p200
aVSo the three-and-a-half billion people
p201
aVthat suffer every year as a result,
p202
aVand the two million kids that die every year,
p203
aVwill live.
p204
aVThank you.
