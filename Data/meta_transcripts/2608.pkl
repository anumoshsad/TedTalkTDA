VThe great philosopher Aristotle said
p4
aVif something doesn't exist, there's no word for it,
p5
aVand if there's no word for something,
p6
aVthat something doesn't exist.
p7
aVSo when we talk about elections,
p8
aVwe in established democracies, we know what we're talking about.
p9
aVWe've got the words. We have the vocabulary.
p10
aVWe know what a polling station is.
p11
aVWe know what a ballot paper is.
p12
aVBut what about countries where democracy doesn't exist,
p13
aVcountries where there are no words to describe the concepts
p14
aVthat underpin a democratic society?
p15
aa(lp16
VI work in the field of electoral assistance,
p17
aVso that's to say we assist
p18
aVemerging democracies to organize
p19
aVwhat is often their first elections.
p20
aVWhen people ask me what I do,
p21
aVquite often I get this answer.
p22
aV"Oh, so you're one of these people who goes around the world
p23
aVimposing Western democracy on countries that can't handle it."
p24
aVWell, the United Nations does not impose anything on anybody.
p25
aVIt really doesn't,
p26
aVand also, what we do
p27
aVis firmly anchored in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
p28
aVArticle 21, that says
p29
aVthat everybody should have the right to choose who governs them.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo that's the basis of the work.
p32
aVI specialize in public outreach.
p33
aVWhat does that mean? Another jargon.
p34
aVIt actually means designing information campaigns
p35
aVso that candidates and voters
p36
aVwho have never had the opportunity to participate or to vote
p37
aVunderstand where, when, how to register;
p38
aVwhere, when, how to vote;
p39
aVwhy, why it is important to take part.
p40
aVSo I'll probably devise a specific campaign to reach out to women
p41
aVto make sure that they can take part,
p42
aVthat they can be part of the process.
p43
aVYoung people as well.
p44
aVAll sorts of people.
p45
aVHandicapped people.
p46
aVWe try to reach everybody.
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd it's not always easy, because very often in this work,
p49
aVI've noticed now over the years that I've been doing it
p50
aVthat words are lacking,
p51
aVand so what do you do?
p52
aa(lp53
VAfghanistan.
p54
aVIt's a country with high levels of illiteracy,
p55
aVand the thing about that was, it was in 2005,
p56
aVand we organized two elections on the same day.
p57
aVThe reason was because the logistics are so incredibly difficult,
p58
aVit seemed to be more efficient to do that.
p59
aVIt was,
p60
aVbut on the other hand, explaining two elections instead of one
p61
aVwas even more complicated.
p62
aVSo we used a lot of images,
p63
aVand when it came to the actual ballot,
p64
aVwe had problems, because so many people wanted to take part,
p65
aVwe had 300 candidates for 52 seats
p66
aVin the Wolesi Jirga, which is the parliamentary elections.
p67
aVAnd for the Provincial Council, we had even more candidates.
p68
aVWe had 330 for 54 seats.
p69
aVSo talking about ballot design,
p70
aVthis is what the ballot looked like.
p71
aVIt's the size of a newspaper.
p72
aVThis was the Wolesi Jirga ballot \u2014
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aVYeah, and \u2014
p75
aVthis was the Provincial Council ballot.
p76
aVEven more.
p77
aVSo you see, we did use a lot of symbols and things like that.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd we had other problems in Southern Sudan.
p80
aVSouthern Sudan was a very different story.
p81
aVWe had so many people who had never, of course, voted,
p82
aVbut we had extremely, extremely high levels of illiteracy,
p83
aVvery, very poor infrastructure.
p84
aVFor example \u2014 I mean, it's a country the size of Texas, more or less.
p85
aVWe had seven kilometers of paved roads,
p86
aVseven kilometers in the whole country,
p87
aVand that includes the tarmac where we landed the planes
p88
aVin Juba Airport.
p89
aVSo transporting electoral materials, etc.,
p90
aVis exceedingly difficult.
p91
aVPeople had no idea about what a box looked like.
p92
aVIt was very complicated,
p93
aVso using verbal communication was obviously the way to go,
p94
aVbut there were 132 languages.
p95
aVSo that was extremely challenging.
p96
aa(lp97
VThen I arrived in Tunisia in 2011.
p98
aVIt was the Arab Spring.
p99
aVA huge amount of hope was generated by that enormous movement
p100
aVthat was going on in the region.
p101
aVThere was Libya, there was Egypt, there was Yemen.
p102
aVIt was an enormous, enormous historical moment.
p103
aVAnd I was sitting with the election commission,
p104
aVand we were talking about various aspects of the election,
p105
aVand I was hearing them using words that I hadn't actually heard before,
p106
aVand I'd worked with Iraqis, I'd worked with Jordanians, Egyptians,
p107
aVand suddenly they were using these words,
p108
aVand I just thought, "This is strange."
p109
aVAnd what really gave rise to it was this word "observer."
p110
aVWe were discussing election observers,
p111
aVand the election commissioner was talking about "mulahiz" in Arabic.
p112
aVThis means "to notice" in a passive sort of sense,
p113
aVas in, "I noticed he was wearing a light blue shirt."
p114
aVDid I go and check whether the shirt was light blue or not?
p115
aVThat is the role of an election observer.
p116
aVIt's very active, it's governed by all kinds of treaties,
p117
aVand it has got that control function in it.
p118
aVAnd then I got wind of the fact that in Egypt,
p119
aVthey were using this term "mutabi\u2019," which means "to follow."
p120
aVSo we were now having followers of an election.
p121
aVSo that's not quite right either,
p122
aVbecause there is a term that's already accepted and in use,
p123
aVwhich was the word "muraqib" which means "a controller."
p124
aVIt's got that notion of control.
p125
aVSo I thought, three words for one concept. This is not good.
p126
aVAnd with our colleagues, we thought perhaps it's our role
p127
aVto actually help make sure that the words are understood
p128
aVand actually create a work of reference
p129
aVthat could be used across the Arab region.
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd that's what we did.
p132
aVSo together with these colleagues,
p133
aVwe launched the "Arabic Lexicon of Electoral Terminology,"
p134
aVand we worked in eight different countries.
p135
aVIt meant actually defining 481 terms
p136
aVwhich formed the basis of everything you need to know
p137
aVif you're going to organize a democratic election.
p138
aVAnd we defined these terms,
p139
aVand we worked with the Arab colleagues
p140
aVand came to an agreement about what would be the appropriate word
p141
aVto use in Arabic.
p142
aVBecause the Arabic language is very rich, and that's part of the problem.
p143
aVBut there are 22 countries that speak Arabic,
p144
aVand they use modern standard Arabic,
p145
aVwhich is the Arabic that is used across the whole region
p146
aVin newspapers and broadcasts,
p147
aVbut of course, then from one country to the next in day to day language and use
p148
aVit varies \u2014 dialect, colloquialisms, etc.
p149
aVSo that was another added layer of complication.
p150
aVSo in one sense you had the problem
p151
aVthat language wasn't fully ripe, if you like,
p152
aVneologisms were coming up, new expressions.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd so we defined all these terms,
p155
aVand then we had eight correspondents in the region.
p156
aVWe submitted the draft to them,
p157
aVthey responded back to us.
p158
aV"Yes, we understand the definition.
p159
aVWe agree with it,
p160
aVbut this is what we say in our country."
p161
aVBecause we were not going to harmonize or force harmonization.
p162
aVWe were trying to facilitate understanding among people.
p163
aVSo in yellow, you see the different expressions in use
p164
aVin the various countries.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo this, I'm happy to say, it took three years to produce this
p167
aVbecause we also finalized the draft and took it actually into the field,
p168
aVsat with the election commissions in all these different countries,
p169
aVdebated and defined and refined the draft,
p170
aVand finally published it in November 2014 in Cairo.
p171
aVAnd it's gone a long way. We published 10,000 copies.
p172
aVTo date, there's about 3,000 downloads off the internet in PDF form.
p173
aVI heard just recently from a colleague that they've taken it up in Somalia.
p174
aVThey're going to produce a version of this in Somalia,
p175
aVbecause there's nothing in Somalia at all.
p176
aVSo that's very good to know.
p177
aVAnd this newly formed Arab Organization for Electoral Management Bodies,
p178
aVwhich is trying to professionalize
p179
aVhow elections are run in the region,
p180
aVthey're using it as well.
p181
aVAnd the Arab League have now built up a pan-Arab observation unit,
p182
aVand they're using it.
p183
aVSo that's all really good.
p184
aa(lp185
VHowever, this work of reference is quite high-pitched.
p186
aVIt's complex, and a lot of the terms are quite technical,
p187
aVso the average person probably doesn't need to know at least a third of it.
p188
aVBut the people of the Middle East
p189
aVhave been deprived of any form of what we know as civic education.
p190
aVIt's part of our curriculum at school.
p191
aVIt doesn't really exist in that part of the world,
p192
aVand I feel it's really the right of everybody
p193
aVto know how these things work.
p194
aVAnd it's a good thing to think about producing a work of reference
p195
aVfor the average person,
p196
aVand bearing in mind that now
p197
aVwe have a basis to work with,
p198
aVbut also we have technology,
p199
aVso we can reach out using telephone apps,
p200
aVvideo, animation.
p201
aVThere's all sorts of tools that can be used now
p202
aVto communicate these ideas to people
p203
aVfor the first time in their own language.
p204
aa(lp205
VWe hear a lot of misery about the Middle East.
p206
aVWe hear the chaos of war. We hear terrorism.
p207
aVWe hear about sectarianism and all this horrible negative news
p208
aVthat comes to us all the time.
p209
aVWhat we're not hearing is what are the people, the everyday people, thinking?
p210
aVWhat are they aspiring to?
p211
aVLet's give them the means, let's give them the words.
p212
aVThe silent majority is silent
p213
aVbecause they don't have the words.
p214
aVThe silent majority needs to know.
p215
aVIt is time to provide people with the knowledge tools
p216
aVthat they can inform themselves with.
p217
aa(lp218
VThe silent majority does not need to be silent.
p219
aVLet's help them have a voice.
p220
