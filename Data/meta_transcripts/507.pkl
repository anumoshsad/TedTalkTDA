VWhat I'm going to try to do is explain to you
p4
aVquickly how to predict,
p5
aVand illustrate it with some predictions
p6
aVabout what Iran is going to do in the next couple of years.
p7
aa(lp8
VIn order to predict effectively,
p9
aVwe need to use science.
p10
aVAnd the reason that we need to use science
p11
aVis because then we can reproduce what we're doing;
p12
aVit's not just wisdom or guesswork.
p13
aVAnd if we can predict,
p14
aVthen we can engineer the future.
p15
aVSo if you are concerned to influence energy policy,
p16
aVor you are concerned to influence national security policy,
p17
aVor health policy, or education,
p18
aVscience \u2014 and a particular branch of science \u2014 is a way to do it,
p19
aVnot the way we've been doing it,
p20
aVwhich is seat-of-the-pants wisdom.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow before I get into how to do it
p23
aVlet me give you a little truth in advertising,
p24
aVbecause I'm not engaged in the business of magic.
p25
aVThere are lots of thing that the approach I take can predict,
p26
aVand there are some that it can't.
p27
aVIt can predict complex negotiations
p28
aVor situations involving coercion \u2014
p29
aVthat is in essence everything that has to do with politics,
p30
aVmuch of what has to do with business,
p31
aVbut sorry, if you're looking to speculate in the stock market,
p32
aVI don't predict stock markets \u2014 OK,
p33
aVit's not going up any time really soon.
p34
aVBut I'm not engaged in doing that.
p35
aVI'm not engaged in predicting random number generators.
p36
aVI actually get phone calls from people
p37
aVwho want to know what lottery numbers are going to win.
p38
aVI don't have a clue.
p39
aa(lp40
VI engage in the use of game theory, game theory is a branch of mathematics
p41
aVand that means, sorry, that even in the study of politics,
p42
aVmath has come into the picture.
p43
aVWe can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics,
p44
aVwe need to look at this in a rigorous way.
p45
aVNow, what is game theory about?
p46
aVIt assumes that people are looking out for what's good for them.
p47
aVThat doesn't seem terribly shocking \u2014
p48
aValthough it's controversial for a lot of people \u2014
p49
aVthat we are self-interested.
p50
aVIn order to look out for what's best for them
p51
aVor what they think is best for them,
p52
aVpeople have values \u2014 they identify what they want, and what they don't want.
p53
aVAnd they have beliefs about what other people want,
p54
aVand what other people don't want, how much power other people have,
p55
aVhow much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want.
p56
aVAnd they face limitations, constraints,
p57
aVthey may be weak, they may be located in the wrong part of the world,
p58
aVthey may be Einstein, stuck away farming
p59
aVsomeplace in a rural village in India not being noticed,
p60
aVas was the case for Ramanujan for a long time,
p61
aVa great mathematician but nobody noticed.
p62
aa(lp63
VNow who is rational?
p64
aVA lot of people are worried about what is rationality about?
p65
aVYou know, what if people are rational?
p66
aVMother Theresa, she was rational.
p67
aVTerrorists, they're rational.
p68
aVPretty much everybody is rational.
p69
aVI think there are only two exceptions that I'm aware of \u2014
p70
aVtwo-year-olds, they are not rational,
p71
aVthey have very fickle preferences,
p72
aVthey switch what they think all the time,
p73
aVand schizophrenics are probably not rational,
p74
aVbut pretty much everybody else is rational.
p75
aVThat is, they are just trying to do
p76
aVwhat they think is in their own best interest.
p77
aa(lp78
VNow in order to work out what people are going to do
p79
aVto pursue their interests,
p80
aVwe have to think about who has influence in the world.
p81
aVIf you're trying to influence corporations to change their behavior,
p82
aVwith regard to producing pollutants,
p83
aVone approach, the common approach,
p84
aVis to exhort them to be better,
p85
aVto explain to them what damage they're doing to the planet.
p86
aVAnd many of you may have noticed that doesn't have
p87
aVas big an effect, as perhaps you would like it to have.
p88
aVBut if you show them that it's in their interest,
p89
aVthen they're responsive.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo, we have to work out who influences problems.
p92
aVIf we're looking at Iran, the president of the United States
p93
aVwe would like to think, may have some influence \u2014
p94
aVcertainly the president in Iran has some influence \u2014
p95
aVbut we make a mistake if we just pay attention
p96
aVto the person at the top of the power ladder
p97
aVbecause that person doesn't know much about Iran,
p98
aVor about energy policy,
p99
aVor about health care,
p100
aVor about any particular policy.
p101
aVThat person surrounds himself or herself with advisers.
p102
aVIf we're talking about national security problems,
p103
aVmaybe it's the Secretary of State,
p104
aVmaybe it's the Secretary of Defense,
p105
aVthe Director of National Intelligence,
p106
aVmaybe the ambassador to the United Nations, or somebody else
p107
aVwho they think is going to know more about the particular problem.
p108
aVBut let's face it, the Secretary of State doesn't know much about Iran.
p109
aVThe secretary of defense doesn't know much about Iran.
p110
aVEach of those people in turn
p111
aVhas advisers who advise them,
p112
aVso they can advise the president.
p113
aVThere are lots of people shaping decisions
p114
aVand so if we want to predict correctly
p115
aVwe have to pay attention to everybody
p116
aVwho is trying to shape the outcome,
p117
aVnot just the people at the pinnacle
p118
aVof the decision-making pyramid.
p119
aa(lp120
VUnfortunately, a lot of times we don't do that.
p121
aVThere's a good reason that we don't do that,
p122
aVand there's a good reason that using game theory and computers,
p123
aVwe can overcome the limitation
p124
aVof just looking at a few people.
p125
aVImagine a problem with just five decision-makers.
p126
aVImagine for example
p127
aVthat Sally over here,
p128
aVwants to know what Harry, and Jane,
p129
aVand George and Frank are thinking,
p130
aVand sends messages to those people.
p131
aVSally's giving her opinion to them,
p132
aVand they're giving their opinion to Sally.
p133
aVBut Sally also wants to know
p134
aVwhat Harry is saying to these three,
p135
aVand what they're saying to Harry.
p136
aVAnd Harry wants to know
p137
aVwhat each of those people are saying to each other, and so on,
p138
aVand Sally would like to know what Harry thinks those people are saying.
p139
aVThat's a complicated problem; that's a lot to know.
p140
aVWith five decision-makers
p141
aVthere are a lot of linkages \u2014
p142
aV120, as a matter of fact,
p143
aVif you remember your factorials.
p144
aVFive factorial is 120.
p145
aVNow you may be surprised to know
p146
aVthat smart people can keep 120 things straight
p147
aVin their head.
p148
aVSuppose we double the number of influencers
p149
aVfrom five to 10.
p150
aVDoes that mean we've doubled the number of pieces of information
p151
aVwe need to know, from 120 to 240?
p152
aVNo. How about 10 times?
p153
aVTo 1,200? No.
p154
aVWe've increased it to 3.6 million.
p155
aVNobody can keep that straight in their head.
p156
aVBut computers,
p157
aVthey can. They don't need coffee breaks,
p158
aVthey don't need vacations,
p159
aVthey don't need to go to sleep at night,
p160
aVthey don't ask for raises either.
p161
aVThey can keep this information straight
p162
aVand that means that we can process the information.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo I'm going to talk to you about how to process it,
p165
aVand I'm going to give you some examples out of Iran,
p166
aVand you're going to be wondering,
p167
aV"Why should we listen to this guy?
p168
aVWhy should we believe what he's saying?"
p169
aVSo I'm going to show you a factoid.
p170
aVThis is an assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency
p171
aVof the percentage of time
p172
aVthat the model I'm talking about
p173
aVis right in predicting things whose outcome is not yet known,
p174
aVwhen the experts who provided the data inputs
p175
aVgot it wrong.
p176
aVThat's not my claim, that's a CIA claim \u2014 you can read it,
p177
aVit was declassified a while ago. You can read it in a volume edited by
p178
aVH. Bradford Westerfield, Yale University Press.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo, what do we need to know
p181
aVin order to predict?
p182
aVYou may be surprised to find out we don't need to know very much.
p183
aVWe do need to know who has a stake
p184
aVin trying to shape the outcome of a decision.
p185
aVWe need to know what they say they want,
p186
aVnot what they want in their heart of hearts,
p187
aVnot what they think they can get,
p188
aVbut what they say they want, because that is a strategically chosen position,
p189
aVand we can work backwards from that
p190
aVto draw inferences about important features of their decision-making.
p191
aVWe need to know how focused they are
p192
aVon the problem at hand.
p193
aVThat is, how willing are they to drop what they're doing when the issue comes up,
p194
aVand attend to it instead of something else that's on their plate \u2014
p195
aVhow big a deal is it to them?
p196
aVAnd how much clout could they bring to bear
p197
aVif they chose to engage on the issue?
p198
aa(lp199
VIf we know those things
p200
aVwe can predict their behavior by assuming that everybody
p201
aVcares about two things on any decision.
p202
aVThey care about the outcome. They'd like an outcome as close to
p203
aVwhat they are interested in as possible.
p204
aVThey're careerists, they also care about getting credit \u2014
p205
aVthere's ego involvement,
p206
aVthey want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome,
p207
aVor as important, if it's their druthers, to block an outcome.
p208
aVAnd so we have to figure out how they balance those two things.
p209
aVDifferent people trade off
p210
aVbetween standing by their outcome,
p211
aVfaithfully holding to it, going down in a blaze of glory,
p212
aVor giving it up, putting their finger in the wind,
p213
aVand doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position.
p214
aVMost people fall in between, and if we can work out where they fall
p215
aVwe can work out how to negotiate with them
p216
aVto change their behavior.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo with just that little bit of input
p219
aVwe can work out what the choices are that people have,
p220
aVwhat the chances are that they're willing to take,
p221
aVwhat they're after, what they value, what they want,
p222
aVand what they believe about other people.
p223
aVYou might notice what we don't need to know:
p224
aVthere's no history in here.
p225
aVHow they got to where they are
p226
aVmay be important in shaping the input information,
p227
aVbut once we know where they are
p228
aVwe're worried about where they're going to be headed in the future.
p229
aVHow they got there turns out not to be terribly critical in predicting.
p230
aVI remind you of that 90 percent accuracy rate.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo where are we going to get this information?
p233
aVWe can get this information
p234
aVfrom the Internet, from The Economist,
p235
aVThe Financial Times, The New York Times,
p236
aVU.S. News and World Report, lots of sources like that,
p237
aVor we can get it from asking experts
p238
aVwho spend their lives studying places and problems,
p239
aVbecause those experts know this information.
p240
aVIf they don't know, who are the people trying to influence the decision,
p241
aVhow much clout do they have,
p242
aVhow much they care about this issue, and what do they say they want,
p243
aVare they experts? That's what it means to be an expert,
p244
aVthat's the basic stuff an expert needs to know.
p245
aa(lp246
VAlright, lets turn to Iran.
p247
aVLet me make three important predictions \u2014
p248
aVyou can check this out, time will tell.
p249
aVWhat is Iran going to do about its nuclear weapons program?
p250
aVHow secure is the theocratic regime in Iran?
p251
aVWhat's its future?
p252
aVAnd everybody's best friend,
p253
aVAhmadinejad. How are things going for him?
p254
aVHow are things going to be working out for him in the next year or two?
p255
aVYou take a look at this, this is not based on statistics.
p256
aVI want to be very clear here. I'm not projecting some past data into the future.
p257
aVI've taken inputs on positions and so forth,
p258
aVrun it through a computer model
p259
aVthat had simulated the dynamics of interaction,
p260
aVand these are the simulated dynamics,
p261
aVthe predictions about the path of policy.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo you can see here on the vertical axis,
p264
aVI haven't shown it all the way down to zero,
p265
aVthere are lots of other options, but here I'm just showing you the prediction,
p266
aVso I've narrowed the scale.
p267
aVUp at the top of the axis, "Build the Bomb."
p268
aVAt 130, we start somewhere above 130,
p269
aVbetween building a bomb, and making enough weapons-grade fuel
p270
aVso that you could build a bomb.
p271
aVThat's where, according to my analyses,
p272
aVthe Iranians were at the beginning of this year.
p273
aVAnd then the model makes predictions down the road.
p274
aVAt 115 they would only produce enough weapons grade fuel
p275
aVto show that they know how, but they wouldn't build a weapon:
p276
aVthey would build a research quantity.
p277
aVIt would achieve some national pride,
p278
aVbut not go ahead and build a weapon.
p279
aVAnd down at 100 they would build civilian nuclear energy,
p280
aVwhich is what they say is their objective.
p281
aa(lp282
VThe yellow line shows us the most likely path.
p283
aVThe yellow line includes an analysis
p284
aVof 87 decision makers in Iran,
p285
aVand a vast number of outside influencers
p286
aVtrying to pressure Iran into changing its behavior,
p287
aVvarious players in the United States, and Egypt,
p288
aVand Saudi Arabia, and Russia, European Union,
p289
aVJapan, so on and so forth.
p290
aVThe white line reproduces the analysis
p291
aVif the international environment
p292
aVjust left Iran to make its own internal decisions,
p293
aVunder its own domestic political pressures.
p294
aVThat's not going to be happening,
p295
aVbut you can see that the line comes down faster
p296
aVif they're not put under international pressure,
p297
aVif they're allowed to pursue their own devices.
p298
aa(lp299
VBut in any event, by the end of this year,
p300
aVbeginning of next year, we get to a stable equilibrium outcome.
p301
aVAnd that equilibrium is not what the United States would like,
p302
aVbut it's probably an equilibrium that the United States can live with,
p303
aVand that a lot of others can live with.
p304
aVAnd that is that Iran will achieve that nationalist pride
p305
aVby making enough weapons-grade fuel, through research,
p306
aVso that they could show that they know how to make weapons-grade fuel,
p307
aVbut not enough to actually build a bomb.
p308
aVHow is this happening?
p309
aVOver here you can see this is the distribution
p310
aVof power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today,
p311
aVthis is what that power block is predicted to be like
p312
aVby the late parts of 2010, early parts of 2011.
p313
aVJust about nobody supports research on weapons-grade fuel today,
p314
aVbut by 2011 that gets to be a big block,
p315
aVand you put these two together, that's the controlling influence in Iran.
p316
aa(lp317
VOut here today, there are a bunch of people \u2014
p318
aVAhmadinejad for example \u2014
p319
aVwho would like not only to build a bomb,
p320
aVbut test a bomb.
p321
aVThat power disappears completely;
p322
aVnobody supports that by 2011.
p323
aVThese guys are all shrinking,
p324
aVthe power is all drifting out here,
p325
aVso the outcome is going to be the weapons-grade fuel.
p326
aa(lp327
VWho are the winners and who are the losers in Iran?
p328
aVTake a look at these guys, they're growing in power,
p329
aVand by the way, this was done a while ago
p330
aVbefore the current economic crisis,
p331
aVand that's probably going to get steeper.
p332
aVThese folks are the moneyed interests in Iran,
p333
aVthe bankers, the oil people, the bazaaries.
p334
aVThey are growing in political clout,
p335
aVas the mullahs are isolating themselves \u2014
p336
aVwith the exception of one group of mullahs,
p337
aVwho are not well known to Americans.
p338
aVThat's this line here, growing in power,
p339
aVthese are what the Iranians call the quietists.
p340
aVThese are the Ayatollahs, mostly based in Qom,
p341
aVwho have great clout in the religious community,
p342
aVhave been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder,
p343
aVbecause they see Iran going in an unhealthy direction,
p344
aVa direction contrary
p345
aVto what Khomeini had in mind.
p346
aVHere is Mr. Ahmadinejad.
p347
aVTwo things to notice: he's getting weaker,
p348
aVand while he gets a lot of attention in the United States,
p349
aVhe is not a major player in Iran.
p350
aVHe is on the way down.
p351
aa(lp352
VOK, so I'd like you to take a little away from this.
p353
aVEverything is not predictable: the stock market
p354
aVis, at least for me, not predictable,
p355
aVbut most complicated negotiations are predictable.
p356
aVAgain, whether we're talking health policy, education,
p357
aVenvironment, energy,
p358
aVlitigation, mergers,
p359
aVall of these are complicated problems
p360
aVthat are predictable,
p361
aVthat this sort of technology can be applied to.
p362
aVAnd the reason that being able to predict those things is important,
p363
aVis not just because you might run a hedge fund and make money off of it,
p364
aVbut because if you can predict what people will do,
p365
aVyou can engineer what they will do.
p366
aVAnd if you engineer what they do you can change the world,
p367
aVyou can get a better result.
p368
aVI would like to leave you with one thought, which is
p369
aVfor me, the dominant theme of this gathering,
p370
aVand is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world.
p371
aVWhen people say to you,
p372
aV"That's impossible,"
p373
aVyou say back to them,
p374
aV"When you say 'That's impossible,'
p375
aVyou're confused with,
p376
aV'I don't know how to do it.'"
p377
aVThank you.
p378
aa(lp379
V(Applause)
p380
aa(lp381
VChris Anderson: One question for you.
p382
aVThat was fascinating.
p383
aVI love that you put it out there.
p384
aVI got very nervous halfway through the talk though,
p385
aVjust panicking whether you'd included in your model, the possibility that
p386
aVputting this prediction out there might change the result.
p387
aVWe've got 800 people in Tehran who watch TEDTalks.
p388
aa(lp389
VBruce Bueno de Mesquita: I've thought about that,
p390
aVand since I've done a lot of work for the intelligence community,
p391
aVthey've also pondered that.
p392
aVIt would be a good thing if
p393
aVpeople paid more attention, took seriously,
p394
aVand engaged in the same sorts of calculations,
p395
aVbecause it would change things. But it would change things in two beneficial ways.
p396
aVIt would hasten how quickly people arrive at an agreement,
p397
aVand so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time.
p398
aVAnd, it would arrive at an agreement that everybody was happy with,
p399
aVwithout having to manipulate them so much \u2014
p400
aVwhich is basically what I do, I manipulate them.
p401
aVSo it would be a good thing.
p402
aa(lp403
VCA: So you're kind of trying to say, "People of Iran, this is your destiny, lets go there."
p404
aa(lp405
VBBM: Well, people of Iran, this is what many of you are going to evolve to want,
p406
aVand we could get there a lot sooner,
p407
aVand you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions,
p408
aVand we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end,
p409
aVand the world would be a better place.
p410
aa(lp411
VCA: Here's hoping they hear it that way. Thank you very much Bruce.
p412
aa(lp413
VBBM: Thank you.
