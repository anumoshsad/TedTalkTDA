VYou know, one of the things that I'd like to say upfront is that
p4
aVI'm really here by accident.
p5
aVAnd what I mean \u2014 not at TED \u2014 that I'm \u2014
p6
aVat this point in my life, truly my set of circumstances
p7
aVI would truly consider an accident.
p8
aVBut what I'd like to talk to you about today
p9
aVis perhaps a way in which we could use technology
p10
aVto make those accidents happen often.
p11
aVBecause I really think, when I look back at how I actually ended up
p12
aVin this accident, technology played a big role in that.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo, what I'd like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself,
p15
aVbecause I'd like to put in context what I'm going to tell you.
p16
aVAnd I think you will see why the two greatest passions in my life today
p17
aVare children and education.
p18
aVAnd once I put that in context,
p19
aVI'd like to tell you a little bit about technology:
p20
aVwhy I believe technology is a tremendous enabler;
p21
aVa very powerful tool to help address some of these challenges.
p22
aVThen, about the initiative that Chris mentioned,
p23
aVthat we decided to launch at AMD that we call 50x15.
p24
aVAnd then I'll come back to the beginning,
p25
aVand tell you a little bit more \u2014 hopefully convince you \u2014
p26
aVthat I believe that in today's world,
p27
aVit is really important for business leaders
p28
aVnot only to have an idea of what their business is all about,
p29
aVbut to have a passion for something that is meaningful.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo, with that in mind, first of all let me tell you,
p32
aVI'm one of five children. I'm the oldest, the other four are women.
p33
aVSo I grew up in a family of women.
p34
aVI learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world.
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aVAnd, as you can imagine, if you can picture this:
p37
aVI was born in a very small village in Mexico,
p38
aVin, unfortunately, very poor surroundings,
p39
aVand my parents did not have a college education.
p40
aVBut I was fortunate to be able to have one, and so were my four sisters.
p41
aVThat kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of the emphasis
p42
aVthat my parents placed on education.
p43
aVMy parents were fanatics about learning,
p44
aVand I'll come back to that a little bit later.
p45
aa(lp46
VBut one of the things that exposed me early to learning,
p47
aVand a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child,
p48
aVwas through a technology which is on the screen \u2014 is a Victrola.
p49
aVMy father found that in a junkyard,
p50
aVand was able to repair it and make it work. And somehow \u2014
p51
aVto this day, I frankly don't know how he was so aware
p52
aVof what was going on in the world \u2014 but,
p53
aVby inviting me to sit down with him when I was only a few years old,
p54
aVand playing records in this Victrola by Mozart, and he would tell me
p55
aVhow Mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever,
p56
aVand how Claire de Lune, which was one of his favorites,
p57
aVwas a real exposure to me to classical music.
p58
aVHe explained to me about Johann Strauss, and how he created the waltzes
p59
aVthat became so famous in the world.
p60
aVAnd would tell me a little bit about history too,
p61
aVwhen he'd play the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky
p62
aVon this little Victrola, and he would tell me about Russia
p63
aVand all the things that were happening in Russia at those times
p64
aVand why this music,
p65
aVin some way, represented a little bit of that history.
p66
aVAnd even as a child, he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity.
p67
aVAnd perhaps to you this product may not look like high tech,
p68
aVbut if you can imagine the time when this occurred \u2014
p69
aVit was in the mid '40s \u2014 this was really, in his view, a pretty piece of high tech.
p70
aa(lp71
VWell, one of the things that is really critical to try to
p72
aVdistill from that experience is that in addition to that,
p73
aVpeople ask me and say, "Well,
p74
aVhow did your parents treat you when you were a child?"
p75
aVAnd I always said that they were really tough on me.
p76
aVAnd not tough in the sense that most people think of,
p77
aVwhere your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever.
p78
aVThey were tough in the sense that, as I grew up,
p79
aVboth my mother and father would always say to me,
p80
aVit's really important that you always remember two things.
p81
aVFirst of all, when you go to bed at night,
p82
aVyou've got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt
p83
aVthe day was a day which you contributed something, and
p84
aVthat you did everything you could to do it the best way you could.
p85
aVAnd the second thing they said: and we trust you,
p86
aVthat no matter where you are or where you go,
p87
aVyou will always do the right thing.
p88
aVNow, I don't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids,
p89
aVbut if you do, please trust me,
p90
aVit's the most pressure you can put on a child, to say \u2014
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aV\u2014 we trust you that you will always do the right thing.
p93
aVWhen I was out with my friends drinking beer,
p94
aVI always was very aware of those words \u2014
p95
aV(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
V\u2014 and very careful. One of the things that has happened with technology
p98
aVis that it can only be helpful if it is useful, of course,
p99
aVbut it can only be helpful too if it's accessible,
p100
aVand it can only be helpful if it's affordable.
p101
aVAnd in today's world, being useful, affordable and accessible
p102
aVis not necessarily what happens
p103
aVin a lot of the technology that is done today.
p104
aVSo, one of our passions in our company,
p105
aVand now one of my personal passions, is to be able to really work hard
p106
aVat making the technology useful, accessible and affordable.
p107
aVAnd to me, that is very, very critical.
p108
aa(lp109
VNow, technology has changed a lot since the Victrola days.
p110
aVYou know, we now have, of course, incredibly powerful computers.
p111
aVA tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the Internet.
p112
aVAlthough frankly speaking, we don't believe the Internet is the killer app.
p113
aVWhat we believe is that the Internet, frankly,
p114
aVis a connection of people and ideas.
p115
aVThe Internet happens to be just the medium
p116
aVin which those people and ideas get connected.
p117
aVAnd the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome.
p118
aVAnd so, we believe that through all the changes that have occurred,
p119
aVthat we're faced today with a tremendous opportunity.
p120
aVIf we can connect people and ideas more intensely \u2014 and although
p121
aVyou've seen a plethora and a myriad of products
p122
aVthat have come to the market today, the key to me is
p123
aVhow many of these products are able to provide people connectivity, in a useful way,
p124
aVaccessibility, in an easy manner,
p125
aVand also affordability, that
p126
aVregardless of the economic status that a person could have,
p127
aVthat they could have the opportunity to afford this technology.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo, when you look at that, we said, well, we would like to, then,
p130
aVenable that a little bit. We would like to create an initiative.
p131
aVAnd a couple of years ago at AMD,
p132
aVwe came up with this idea of saying,
p133
aVwhat if we create this initiative we call 50x15,
p134
aVwhere we are going to aim, that by the year 2015,
p135
aVhalf of the world will be connected to the Internet
p136
aVso that people and ideas can get connected.
p137
aVWe knew we couldn't do it by ourselves, and by no means
p138
aVdid we ever intend to imply that we at AMD could do it alone.
p139
aVWe always felt that this was something that could be done
p140
aVthrough partnerships with governments, industry,
p141
aVeducational institutions, a myriad of other companies and, frankly, even competitors.
p142
aVSo, it is really a rather lofty initiative,
p143
aVif you want to think that way,
p144
aVbut we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead,
p145
aVthat was bold enough and courageous enough
p146
aVthat it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently.
p147
aVAnd I'll come back to that in a minute, because I think
p148
aVthe results so far have been remarkable,
p149
aVand I can only anticipate and get real excited about
p150
aVwhat I think is going to happen in the next eight years,
p151
aVwhile we get to the 2015 initiative.
p152
aa(lp153
VWhere are we today?
p154
aVThat's year by year. This comes from our friends at Gapminder.com.
p155
aVThose of you who've never looked at their website,
p156
aVyou should look at it. It's really impressive. And you can see
p157
aVhow the Internet penetration has changed over the years.
p158
aVAnd so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say
p159
aVwell, where are we related to our goal towards 2015,
p160
aVthe thing that becomes apparent is three pieces.
p161
aVOne is the Western world,
p162
aVdefined mostly by Western Europe and the United States,
p163
aVhas made an awful lot of progress.
p164
aVThe connectivity in these parts of the world
p165
aVare really truly phenomenal and continue to increase.
p166
aa(lp167
VAs a matter of fact, we think reaching 100 percent is very doable,
p168
aVeven before the 2015 timeframe. In other parts of emerging countries,
p169
aVsuch as India and China, the progress has been good \u2014
p170
aVhas been solid, has been good. But in places that are not as developed,
p171
aVplaces like Africa, Latin America and other places in the world,
p172
aVthe progress has been rather slow. As a matter of fact,
p173
aVI was just recently visiting South Africa.
p174
aVI had the opportunity to have a discussion with President Mbeki,
p175
aVand one of the things that we talked about is, what is it
p176
aVthat's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster?
p177
aVAnd one of the reasons is, in South Africa,
p178
aVit costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity.
p179
aVIt is impossible, even in the United States, for that cost,
p180
aVto be able to enable the connectivity that we're all trying to reach.
p181
aVSo, we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner
p182
aVto be able to bring the cost of this technology down.
p183
aVSo, when you look at this chart,
p184
aVyou look at the very last \u2014 it's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale \u2014
p185
aVyou look at the very end:
p186
aVwe've got quite a long way to go to get to the 2015 goal of 50 percent.
p187
aVBut we're excited in our company; we're motivated.
p188
aVWe really think it's a phenomenal driver of things,
p189
aVto force us to do things differently, and we look forward to being able to actually,
p190
aVworking with so many partners around the world,
p191
aVto be able to reach that goal.
p192
aa(lp193
VNow, one of the things I'd like to explain [about] 50x15,
p194
aVwhich I think is really critical, is that it is not a charity.
p195
aVIt is actually a business venture.
p196
aVLet's take a small segment of this, of this unconnected world,
p197
aVand call it the education market.
p198
aVWhen you look at elementary-school children,
p199
aVwe have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world
p200
aVthat could benefit tremendously
p201
aVfrom being able to be connected to the Internet.
p202
aVTherefore, when we see that, we see an opportunity
p203
aVto have a business that addresses the need of that segment.
p204
aVAnd when we embarked in this initiative, from the very beginning
p205
aVwe said it very clearly: this is not a charity.
p206
aVThis is really a business venture,
p207
aVone that addresses a very challenging segment of the market.
p208
aVBecause what we have learned in the last three years
p209
aVis that this segment of the market, whether it's education
p210
aVor under-developed nations, either way, it's a segment that demands
p211
aVincredibly high quality, incredibly high reliability,
p212
aVtremendous low cost and access, and a lot of challenges
p213
aVthat frankly, without actually doing it,
p214
aVit would be very difficult to understand, and
p215
aVI'll explain that in just a minute.
p216
aa(lp217
VIt is an initiative that is focused on simple, accessible and human-centric solutions.
p218
aVWhat we mean by that is,
p219
aVyou know, frankly, the PC was invented in 1980, roughly speaking
p220
aVmore or less, and for 20-odd years, it hasn't changed.
p221
aVIt is still, in most places, a gray or black box, and it looks the same.
p222
aVAnd frankly \u2014 and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customers
p223
aVwhen I say this, but I truly mean it \u2014
p224
aVif you could take the name of the computer off the top of it,
p225
aVit would be very difficult to judge who made it,
p226
aVbecause they're all highly commoditized but they're all different.
p227
aVSo, there has not been a human-centric approach
p228
aVto addressing this segment of the market,
p229
aVso we really believe it is critical to think of it.
p230
aa(lp231
VIt reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning, about this
p232
aVoperating room machinery that was designed specifically for Africa.
p233
aVWe're talking about something very similar here.
p234
aVAnd it has to be based on a geo-sensitive approach.
p235
aVWhat I mean by that is that in some parts of the world,
p236
aVthe government plays a key role in the development of technology.
p237
aVIn other parts, it doesn't.
p238
aVIn other parts of the world, you have an infrastructure
p239
aVthat allows for manufacturing to take place.
p240
aVIn other parts, it doesn't. And then we have to be sensitive
p241
aVabout how this technology can be developed
p242
aVand put into action in those regions.
p243
aVAnd the last piece, which is really important \u2014
p244
aVand this is an opinion that we have, not shared by many,
p245
aVthis is one where we seem to stand alone, on this one \u2014
p246
aVis that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative
p247
aVcan come by fostering local, integrated, end-to-end ecosystems.
p248
aa(lp249
VWhat I mean by that, and let me use this example,
p250
aVthe country of South Africa, because I was just there,
p251
aVtherefore I'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have.
p252
aVIt's a country of 45 million people. It's an economy that's emerging.
p253
aVIt's beginning to grow tremendously.
p254
aVThey have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity.
p255
aVThey have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa.
p256
aVThey're developing a software-training environment in their universities.
p257
aVWhat a place, what an ideal place
p258
aVto create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software
p259
aVneeded for their schools. And to my surprise, I learned in South Africa
p260
aVthey have 18 dialects, I always thought they only had two \u2014
p261
aVEnglish and Afrikaans \u2014 but it turns out they have 18 dialects.
p262
aVAnd to be able to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system,
p263
aVit could only be done from inside.
p264
aVI don't think this segment of the market can be addressed
p265
aVby companies parachuting from another place of the world,
p266
aVand just dumping product and selling into the markets.
p267
aVSo, we believe that in those regions of the world
p268
aVwhere the population is large,
p269
aVand there's an infrastructure that can provide it,
p270
aVthat a local, integrated, end-to-end system
p271
aVis really critical for its success.
p272
aa(lp273
VThis is a picture of a classroom that we outfitted with computers
p274
aVin Mexico, in my home country.
p275
aVThis particular classroom happens to be in the state of Michoacan.
p276
aVThose of you that might be familiar with Mexico \u2014
p277
aVMichoacan is a very colorful state.
p278
aVChildren dress with very colorful, colorful clothes,
p279
aVand it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids,
p280
aVin a computer. And I have to tell you that it's
p281
aVso easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology
p282
aVand connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids.
p283
aVWe just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school
p284
aVin the West Cape in South Africa,
p285
aVin a school that's called Nelson Mandela School,
p286
aVand when you see the faces and activities of these children
p287
aVbeing able to access computers, it's just phenomenal.
p288
aVAnd recently, they've written us letters,
p289
aVtelling us how excited they are about the impact
p290
aVthat this has had on their lives, on their educational dreams,
p291
aVon their capabilities, and it's just phenomenal.
p292
aa(lp293
VWe have now deployed 30 different technologists
p294
aVin 18 different countries, and we have been able
p295
aVto connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn
p296
aVwhat this particular segment of the market needs and demands.
p297
aVAnd I have to tell you that although
p298
aVmillions doesn't sound like a lot
p299
aVin terms of the billions that need to be connected,
p300
aVit's a start. And we are learning a lot.
p301
aVAnd we're learning a tremendous amount about
p302
aVwhat we believe this segment needs to be able to be effective.
p303
aa(lp304
VOne example of this has been the One Laptop per Child.
p305
aVSome of you are familiar with this.
p306
aVThis is a partnership between MIT and a group of companies \u2014
p307
aVGoogle is involved, Red Hat \u2014 and AMD is a key player.
p308
aVThe electronics behind the One Laptop per Child
p309
aVare based on AMD technology; it's a microprocessor.
p310
aVBut to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be,
p311
aVone of the objectives of the One Laptop per Child
p312
aVis to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life.
p313
aVBecause it was felt that a school day
p314
aVwould last at least eight hours, and
p315
aVyou wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop
p316
aVfor at least one full day without having to recharge it.
p317
aVThe engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part,
p318
aVand battery life on this product is now 15 hours \u2014
p319
aVjust through a lot of innovative work people have done
p320
aVbecause they're passionate and motivated to be able to do this.
p321
aVWe expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year,
p322
aVand we're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer
p323
aVin the field of education.
p324
aVIt's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market,
p325
aVnot only in the developing countries, but actually
p326
aVin the developed regions as well, because
p327
aVthere are parts of the United States where this can have
p328
aValso a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient.
p329
aa(lp330
VWe also have partnered with TED
p331
aVin this project, with Architecture for Humanity,
p332
aVand along with the TED Prize winner Cameron Sinclair,
p333
aVwe're having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community
p334
aVto come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region.
p335
aVAnd we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this,
p336
aVand can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting, exciting activity.
p337
aa(lp338
VLet me come back to the beginning,
p339
aVto end this presentation.
p340
aVI'll tell you that one of the things
p341
aVthat I feel is really critical for us in industry, in business,
p342
aVis to be able to be passionate about solving these problems.
p343
aVI don't think it's enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet,
p344
aVand look at numbers and say, yes, that's a good business.
p345
aVI really believe that you have to have a passion for it.
p346
aa(lp347
VAnd one of the things that I learned, too, from my parents \u2014
p348
aVand I'll give you a little anecdote \u2014 especially from my father.
p349
aVAnd it took me a while to understand it,
p350
aVbut he said to me, when I went to college, he said,
p351
aV"You're the first person in the family to go to college.
p352
aVAnd it's really important you understand
p353
aVthat for civilization to make progress,
p354
aVeach generation has to do better than the last one.
p355
aVAnd therefore, this is your opportunity to do better than my generation."
p356
aVFrankly, I don't know that I really understood what he told me at the time.
p357
aVI was eager to go off to college, and go find girls, and study,
p358
aVand girls, and study, but then I finished college and I fell in love.
p359
aVI graduated. I decided to get married.
p360
aVAnd on my wedding day, my father came to me again and said, "You know,
p361
aVI'm going to remind you again, that each generation
p362
aVhas to do better than the last one.
p363
aVYou have to be a better husband than I was,
p364
aVbecause that's how you make progress." And now he began to make sense.
p365
aVBecause I knew what a great husband he was,
p366
aVand now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me,
p367
aVlike he did when I was a little kid. And then a few years later, I had a child,
p368
aVmy first child, and again, my father comes
p369
aVto the hospital, and we're looking at the glass,
p370
aVand see all the children on the other side, and he said,
p371
aV"I've got to remind you again, that for each generation to do better,
p372
aVyou're going to have to be a better father than I was."
p373
aVThat's when it dawned on me the tremendous challenge
p374
aVthat he was placing on me, because he was a great father.
p375
aVBut the key is that he instilled in me a passion
p376
aVto really get up every day in the morning and want to do better,
p377
aVto really get up and think that my role in life
p378
aVis not just to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company.
p379
aVIt's got to be that someday I can look back,
p380
aVand this place is truly better through some small contribution
p381
aVthat perhaps each of us could make.
p382
aVThank you very much.
