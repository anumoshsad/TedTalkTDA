VChris Anderson: Perhaps we could start by just telling us about your country.
p4
aVIt's three dots there on the globe. Those dots are pretty huge.
p5
aVI think each one is about the size of California.
p6
aVTell us about Kiribati.
p7
aa(lp8
VAnote Tong: Well, let me first begin by saying how deeply grateful I am
p9
aVfor this opportunity to share my story with people who do care.
p10
aVI think I've been sharing my story with a lot of people who don't care too much.
p11
aVBut Kiribati is comprised of three groups of islands:
p12
aVthe Gilbert Group on the west,
p13
aVwe have the Phoenix Islands in the middle,
p14
aVand the Line Islands in the east.
p15
aVAnd quite frankly, Kiribati is perhaps the only country
p16
aVthat is actually in the four corners of the world,
p17
aVbecause we are in the Northern Hemisphere, in the Southern Hemisphere,
p18
aVand also in the east and the west of the International Date Line.
p19
aVThese islands are entirely made up of coral atolls,
p20
aVand on average about two meters above sea level.
p21
aVAnd so this is what we have.
p22
aVUsually not more than two kilometers in width.
p23
aVAnd so, on many occasions, I've been asked by people,
p24
aV"You know, you're suffering, why don't you move back?"
p25
aVThey don't understand.
p26
aVThey have no concept of what it is that's involved.
p27
aVWith the rising sea, they say, "Well, you can move back."
p28
aVAnd so this is what I tell them.
p29
aVIf we move back, we will fall off on the other side of the ocean. OK?
p30
aVBut these are the kinds of issues that people don't understand.
p31
aa(lp32
VCA: So certainly this is just a picture of fragility there.
p33
aVWhen was it that you yourself realized
p34
aVthat there might be impending peril for your country?
p35
aa(lp36
VAT: Well, the story of climate change has been one that has been going on
p37
aVfor quite a number of decades.
p38
aVAnd when I came into office in 2003,
p39
aVI began talking about climate change at the United Nations General Assembly,
p40
aVbut not with so much passion,
p41
aVbecause then there was still this controversy among the scientists
p42
aVwhether it was human-induced, whether it was real or it wasn't.
p43
aVBut I think that that debate was fairly much concluded in 2007
p44
aVwith the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC,
p45
aVwhich made a categorical statement that it is real, it's human-induced,
p46
aVand it's predicting some very serious scenarios
p47
aVfor countries like mine.
p48
aVAnd so that's when I got very serious.
p49
aVIn the past, I talked about it.
p50
aVWe were worried.
p51
aVBut when the scenarios, the predictions came in 2007,
p52
aVit became a real issue for us.
p53
aa(lp54
VCA: Now, those predictions are, I think, that by 2100,
p55
aVsea levels are forecast to rise perhaps three feet.
p56
aVThere's scenarios where it's higher than that, for sure,
p57
aVbut what would you say to a skeptic who said,
p58
aV"What's three feet?
p59
aVYou're on average six feet above sea level.
p60
aVWhat's the problem?"
p61
aa(lp62
VAT: Well, I think it's got to be understood
p63
aVthat a marginal rise in sea level
p64
aVwould mean a loss of a lot of land,
p65
aVbecause much of the land is low.
p66
aVAnd quite apart from that, we are getting the swells at the moment.
p67
aVSo it's not about getting two feet.
p68
aVI think what many people do not understand
p69
aVis they think climate change is something that is happening in the future.
p70
aVWell, we're at the very bottom end of the spectrum.
p71
aVIt's already with us.
p72
aVWe have communities who already have been dislocated.
p73
aVThey have had to move, and every parliament session,
p74
aVI'm getting complaints from different communities
p75
aVasking for assistance to build seawalls,
p76
aVto see what we can do about the freshwater lens
p77
aVbecause it's being destroyed,
p78
aVand so in my trips to the different islands,
p79
aVI'm seeing evidence of communities
p80
aVwhich are now having to cope with the loss of food crops,
p81
aVthe contamination of the water lenses,
p82
aVand I see these communities perhaps leaving, having to relocate,
p83
aVwithin five to 10 years.
p84
aa(lp85
VCA: And then, I think the country suffered its first cyclone,
p86
aVand this is connected, yes? What happened here?
p87
aa(lp88
VAT: Well, we're on the equator,
p89
aVand I'm sure many of you understand that when you're on the equator,
p90
aVit's supposed to be in the doldrums. We're not supposed to get the cyclones.
p91
aVWe create them, and then we send them either north or south.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VBut they aren't supposed to come back.
p96
aVBut for the first time, at the beginning of this year,
p97
aVthe Cyclone Pam, which destroyed Vanuatu,
p98
aVand in the process, the very edges of it actually touched
p99
aVour two southernmost islands,
p100
aVand all of Tuvalu was underwater when Hurricane Pam struck.
p101
aVBut for our two southernmost islands,
p102
aVwe had waves come over half the island,
p103
aVand so this has never happened before.
p104
aVIt's a new experience.
p105
aVAnd I've just come back from my own constituency,
p106
aVand I've seen these beautiful trees which had been there for decades,
p107
aVthey've been totally destroyed.
p108
aVSo this is what's happening,
p109
aVbut when we talk about the rising sea level,
p110
aVwe think it's something that happens gradually.
p111
aVIt comes with the winds, it comes with the swells,
p112
aVand so they can be magnified,
p113
aVbut what we are beginning to witness is the change in the weather pattern,
p114
aVwhich is perhaps the more urgent challenge
p115
aVthat we will face sooner than perhaps the rising sea level.
p116
aa(lp117
VCA: So the country is already seeing effects now.
p118
aVAs you look forward,
p119
aVwhat are your options as a country, as a nation?
p120
aa(lp121
VAT: Well, I've been telling this story every year.
p122
aVI think I visit a number of \u2014
p123
aVI've been traveling the world to try and get people to understand.
p124
aVWe have a plan, we think we have a plan.
p125
aVAnd on one occasion, I think I spoke in Geneva
p126
aVand there was a gentleman who was interviewing me
p127
aVon something like this,
p128
aVand I said, "We are looking at floating islands,"
p129
aVand he thought it was funny, but somebody said,
p130
aV"No, this is not funny. These people are looking for solutions."
p131
aVAnd so I have been looking at floating islands.
p132
aVThe Japanese are interested in building floating islands.
p133
aa(lp134
VBut, as a country, we have made a commitment
p135
aVthat no matter what happens, we will try as much as possible
p136
aVto stay and continue to exist as a nation.
p137
aVWhat that will take,
p138
aVit's going to be something quite significant,
p139
aVvery, very substantial.
p140
aVEither we live on floating islands,
p141
aVor we have to build up the islands to continue to stay out of the water
p142
aVas the sea level rises and as the storms get more severe.
p143
aVBut even that, it's going to be very, very difficult
p144
aVto get the kind of resourcing that we would need.
p145
aa(lp146
VCA: And then the only recourse is some form of forced migration.
p147
aa(lp148
VAT: Well, we are also looking at that
p149
aVbecause in the event that nothing comes forward
p150
aVfrom the international community,
p151
aVwe are preparing,
p152
aVwe don't want to be caught like what's happening in Europe.
p153
aVOK? We don't want to mass migrate at some point in time.
p154
aVWe want to be able to give the people the choice today,
p155
aVthose who choose and want to do that, to migrate.
p156
aVWe don't want something to happen that they are forced to migrate
p157
aVwithout having been prepared to do so.
p158
aVOf course, our culture is very different, our society is very different,
p159
aVand once we migrate into a different environment,
p160
aVa different culture,
p161
aVthere's a whole lot of adjustments that are required.
p162
aa(lp163
VCA: Well, there's forced migration in your country's past,
p164
aVand I think just this week,
p165
aVjust yesterday or the day before yesterday,
p166
aVyou visited these people.
p167
aVWhat happened here? What's the story here?
p168
aa(lp169
VAT: Yes, and I'm sorry, I think somebody was asking
p170
aVwhy we were sneaking off to visit that place.
p171
aVI had a very good reason, because we have a community of Kiribati people
p172
aVliving in that part of the Solomon Islands,
p173
aVbut these were people who were relocated from the Phoenix Islands, in fact,
p174
aVin the 1960s.
p175
aVThere was serious drought, and the people could not continue to live on the island,
p176
aVand so they were moved to live here in the Solomon Islands.
p177
aVAnd so yesterday it was very interesting to meet with these people.
p178
aVThey didn't know who I was. They hadn't heard of me.
p179
aVSome of them later recognized me,
p180
aVbut I think they were very happy.
p181
aVLater they really wanted to have the opportunity to welcome me formally.
p182
aVBut I think what I saw yesterday was very interesting
p183
aVbecause here I see our people.
p184
aVI spoke in our language, and of course they spoke back, they replied,
p185
aVbut their accent, they are beginning not to be able to speak Kiribati properly.
p186
aVI saw them, there was this lady with red teeth.
p187
aVShe was chewing betel nuts,
p188
aVand it's not something we do in Kiribati.
p189
aVWe don't chew betel nuts.
p190
aVI met also a family who have married the local people here,
p191
aVand so this is what is happening.
p192
aVAs you go into another community, there are bound to be changes.
p193
aVThere is bound to be a certain loss of identity,
p194
aVand this is what we will be looking for in the future
p195
aVif and when we do migrate.
p196
aa(lp197
VCA: It must have been just an extraordinarily emotional day
p198
aVbecause of these questions about identity,
p199
aVthe joy of seeing you and perhaps an emphasized sense of what they had lost.
p200
aVAnd it's very inspiring to hear you say you're going to fight to the end
p201
aVto try to preserve the nation in a location.
p202
aa(lp203
VAT: This is our wish.
p204
aVNobody wants ever to leave their home,
p205
aVand so it's been a very difficult decision for me.
p206
aVAs a leader, you don't make plans to leave your island, your home,
p207
aVand so I've been asked on a number of occasions,
p208
aV"So how do you feel?"
p209
aVAnd it doesn't feel good at all.
p210
aVIt's an emotional thing, and I've tried to live with it,
p211
aVand I know that on occasions, I'm accused of not trying to solve the problem
p212
aVbecause I can't solve the problem.
p213
aVIt's something that's got to be done collectively.
p214
aa(lp215
VClimate change is a global phenomenon, and as I've often argued,
p216
aVunfortunately, the countries, when we come to the United Nations \u2014
p217
aVI was in a meeting with the Pacific Island Forum countries
p218
aVwhere Australia and New Zealand are also members,
p219
aVand we had an argument.
p220
aVThere was a bit of a story in the news
p221
aVbecause they were arguing that to cut emissions,
p222
aVit would be something that they're unable to do
p223
aVbecause it would affect the industries.
p224
aVAnd so here I was saying,
p225
aVOK, I hear you,
p226
aVI understand what you're saying,
p227
aVbut try also to understand what I'm saying
p228
aVbecause if you do not cut your emissions,
p229
aVthen our survival is on the line.
p230
aVAnd so it's a matter for you to weigh this, these moral issues.
p231
aVIt's about industry as opposed to the survival of a people.
p232
aa(lp233
VCA: You know, I ask you yesterday what made you angry,
p234
aVand you said, "I don't get angry." But then you paused.
p235
aVI think this made you angry.
p236
aa(lp237
VAT: I'd refer you to my earlier statement at the United Nations.
p238
aVI was very angry, very frustrated and then depressed.
p239
aVThere was a sense of futility
p240
aVthat we are fighting a fight that we have no hope of winning.
p241
aVI had to change my approach.
p242
aVI had to become more reasonable
p243
aVbecause I thought people would listen to somebody who was rational,
p244
aVbut I remain radically rational, whatever that is.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VCA: Now, a core part of your nation's identity is fishing.
p249
aVI think you said pretty much everyone is involved in fishing in some way.
p250
aa(lp251
VAT: Well, we eat fish every day, every day,
p252
aVand I think there is no doubt that our rate of consumption of fish
p253
aVis perhaps the highest in the world.
p254
aVWe don't have a lot of livestock,
p255
aVso it's fish that we depend on.
p256
aa(lp257
VCA: So you're dependent on fish, both at the local level
p258
aVand for the revenues that the country receives
p259
aVfrom the global fishing business for tuna,
p260
aVand yet despite that, a few years ago you took a very radical step.
p261
aVCan you tell us about that?
p262
aVI think something happened right here in the Phoenix Islands.
p263
aa(lp264
VAT: Let me give some of the background of what fish means for us.
p265
aVWe have one of the largest tuna fisheries remaining in the world.
p266
aVIn the Pacific, I think we own something like 60 percent
p267
aVof the remaining tuna fisheries,
p268
aVand it remains relatively healthy for some species, but not all.
p269
aVAnd Kiribati is one of the three major resource owners,
p270
aVtuna resource owners.
p271
aVAnd at the moment, we have been getting
p272
aVsomething like 80 to 90 percent of our revenue
p273
aVfrom access fees, license fees.
p274
aa(lp275
VCA: Of your national revenue.
p276
aa(lp277
VAT: National revenue,
p278
aVwhich drives everything that we do
p279
aVin governments, hospitals, schools and what have you.
p280
aVBut we decided to close this, and it was a very difficult decision.
p281
aVI can assure you, politically, locally, it was not easy,
p282
aVbut I was convinced that we had to do this
p283
aVin order to ensure that the fishery remains sustainable.
p284
aVThere had been some indications that some of the species,
p285
aVin particular the bigeye, was under serious threat.
p286
aVThe yellowfin was also heavily fished.
p287
aVSkipjack remains healthy.
p288
aVAnd so we had to do something like that, and so that was the reason I did that.
p289
aVAnother reason why I did that
p290
aVwas because I had been asking the international community
p291
aVthat in order to deal with climate change, in order to fight climate change,
p292
aVthere has got to be sacrifice, there has got to be commitment.
p293
aVSo in asking the international community to make a sacrifice,
p294
aVI thought we ourselves need to make that sacrifice.
p295
aVAnd so we made the sacrifice.
p296
aVAnd forgoing commercial fishing
p297
aVin the Phoenix Islands protected area
p298
aVwould mean a loss of revenue.
p299
aVWe are still trying to assess what that loss would be
p300
aVbecause we actually closed it off at the beginning of this year,
p301
aVand so we will see by the end of this year
p302
aVwhat it means in terms of the lost revenue.
p303
aa(lp304
VCA: So there's so many things playing into this.
p305
aVOn the one hand, it may prompt healthier fisheries.
p306
aVI mean, how much are you able to move the price up
p307
aVthat you charge for the remaining areas?
p308
aa(lp309
VAT: The negotiations have been very difficult,
p310
aVbut we have managed to raise the cost of a vessel day.
p311
aVFor any vessel to come in to fish for a day,
p312
aVwe have raised the fee from \u2014 it was $6,000 and $8,000,
p313
aVnow to $10,000, $12,000 per vessel day.
p314
aVAnd so there's been that significant increase.
p315
aVBut at the same time, what's important to note is,
p316
aVwhereas in the past these fishing boats
p317
aVmight be fishing in a day and maybe catch 10 tons,
p318
aVnow they're catching maybe 100 tons because they've become so efficient.
p319
aVAnd so we've got to respond likewise.
p320
aVWe've got to be very, very careful because the technology has so improved.
p321
aVThere was a time when the Brazilian fleet moved from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
p322
aVThey couldn't.
p323
aVThey started experimenting if they could, per se.
p324
aVBut now they've got ways of doing it, and they've become so efficient.
p325
aa(lp326
VCA: Can you give us a sense of what it's like in those negotiations?
p327
aVBecause you're up against companies
p328
aVthat have hundreds of millions of dollars at stake, essentially.
p329
aVHow do you hold the line?
p330
aVIs there any advice you can give
p331
aVto other leaders who are dealing with the same companies
p332
aVabout how to get the most for your country,
p333
aVget the most for the fish?
p334
aVWhat advice would you give?
p335
aa(lp336
VAT: Well, I think we focus too often on licensing
p337
aVin order to get the rate of return,
p338
aVbecause what we are getting from license fees
p339
aVis about 10 percent of the landed value of the catch
p340
aVon the side of the wharf, not in the retail shops.
p341
aVAnd we only get about 10 percent.
p342
aVWhat we have been trying to do over the years
p343
aVis actually to increase our participation in the industry,
p344
aVin the harvesting, in the processing,
p345
aVand eventually, hopefully, the marketing.
p346
aVThey're not easy to penetrate,
p347
aVbut we are working towards that,
p348
aVand yes, the answer would be to enhance.
p349
aVIn order to increase our rate of return, we have to become more involved.
p350
aVAnd so we've started doing that,
p351
aVand we have to restructure the industry.
p352
aVWe've got to tell these people that the world has changed.
p353
aVNow we want to produce the fish ourselves.
p354
aa(lp355
VCA: And meanwhile, for your local fishermen,
p356
aVthey are still able to fish,
p357
aVbut what is business like for them?
p358
aVIs it getting harder? Are the waters depleted?
p359
aVOr is that being run on a sustainable basis?
p360
aa(lp361
VAT: For the artisanal fishery,
p362
aVwe do not participate in the commercial fishing activity
p363
aVexcept only to supply the domestic market.
p364
aVThe tuna fishery is really entirely for the foreign market,
p365
aVmostly here in the US, Europe, Japan.
p366
aVSo I am a fisherman, very much,
p367
aVand I used to be able to catch yellowfin.
p368
aVNow it's very, very rare to be able to catch yellowfin
p369
aVbecause they are being lifted out of the water by the hundreds of tons
p370
aVby these purse seiners.
p371
aa(lp372
VCA: So here's a couple of beautiful girls from your country.
p373
aVI mean, as you think about their future,
p374
aVwhat message would you have for them
p375
aVand what message would you have for the world?
p376
aa(lp377
VAT: Well, I've been telling the world that we really have to do something
p378
aVabout what is happening to the climate
p379
aVbecause for us, it's about the future of these children.
p380
aVI have 12 grandchildren, at least.
p381
aVI think I have 12, my wife knows.
p382
aa(lp383
V(Laughter)
p384
aa(lp385
VAnd I think I have eight children.
p386
aVIt's about their future.
p387
aVEvery day I see my grandchildren, about the same age as these young girls,
p388
aVand I do wonder,
p389
aVand I get angry sometimes, yes I do.
p390
aVI wonder what is to become of them.
p391
aVAnd so it's about them
p392
aVthat we should be telling everybody,
p393
aVthat it's not about their own national interest,
p394
aVbecause climate change, regrettably, unfortunately,
p395
aVis viewed by many countries as a national problem. It's not.
p396
aVAnd this is the argument we got into recently with our partners,
p397
aVthe Australians and New Zealanders,
p398
aVbecause they said, "We can't cut any more."
p399
aVThis is what one of the leaders, the Australian leader, said,
p400
aVthat we've done our part, we are cutting back.
p401
aVI said, What about the rest? Why don't you keep it?
p402
aVIf you could keep the rest of your emissions
p403
aVwithin your boundaries, within your borders,
p404
aVwe'd have no question.
p405
aVYou can go ahead as much as you like.
p406
aVBut unfortunately, you're sending it our way,
p407
aVand it's affecting the future of our children.
p408
aVAnd so surely I think that is the heart of the problem of climate change today.
p409
aa(lp410
VWe will be meeting in Paris at the end of this year,
p411
aVbut until we can think of this as a global phenomenon,
p412
aVbecause we create it, individually, as nations,
p413
aVbut it affects everybody else,
p414
aVand yet, we refuse to do anything about it,
p415
aVand we deal with it as a national problem,
p416
aVwhich it is not \u2014 it is a global issue,
p417
aVand it's got to be dealt with collectively.
p418
aa(lp419
VCA: People are incredibly bad at responding to graphs and numbers,
p420
aVand we shut our minds to it.
p421
aVSomehow, to people, we're slightly better at responding to that sometimes.
p422
aVAnd it seems like it's very possible that your nation,
p423
aVdespite, actually because of the intense problems you face,
p424
aVyou may yet be the warning light to the world that shines most visibly,
p425
aVmost powerfully.
p426
aVI just want to thank you,  I'm sure, on behalf of all of us,
p427
aVfor your extraordinary leadership and for being here.
p428
aa(lp429
VMr. President, thank you so much.
