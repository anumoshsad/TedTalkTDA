VLet me introduce you to
p4
aVsomething I've been working on.
p5
aVIt's what the Victorian illusionists
p6
aVwould have described as a mechanical marvel,
p7
aVan automaton,
p8
aVa thinking machine.
p9
aVSay hello to EDI.
p10
aVNow he's asleep. Let's wake him up.
p11
aVEDI, EDI.
p12
aa(lp13
VThese mechanical performers were popular
p14
aVthroughout Europe.
p15
aVAudiences marveled at the way they moved.
p16
aVIt was science fiction made true,
p17
aVrobotic engineering in a pre-electronic age,
p18
aVmachines far in advance of anything
p19
aVthat Victorian technology could create,
p20
aVa machine we would later know
p21
aVas the robot.
p22
aa(lp23
VEDI: Robot. A word coined in 1921
p24
aVin a science fiction tale
p25
aVby the Czech playwright Karel \u010capek.
p26
aVIt comes from "robota."
p27
aVIt means "forced labor."
p28
aa(lp29
VMarco Tempest: But these robots were not real.
p30
aVThey were not intelligent.
p31
aVThey were illusions,
p32
aVa clever combination of mechanical engineering
p33
aVand the deceptiveness of the conjurer's art.
p34
aVEDI is different.
p35
aVEDI is real.
p36
aa(lp37
VEDI: I am 176 centimeters tall.
p38
aa(lp39
VMT: He weighs 300 pounds.
p40
aa(lp41
VEDI: I have two seven-axis arms \u2014
p42
aa(lp43
VMT: Core of sensing \u2014
p44
aa(lp45
VEDI: A 360-degree sonar detection system,
p46
aVand come complete with a warranty.
p47
aa(lp48
VMT: We love robots.
p49
aa(lp50
VEDI: Hi. I'm EDI. Will you be my friend?
p51
aa(lp52
VMT: We are intrigued by the possibility
p53
aVof creating a mechanical version of ourselves.
p54
aVWe build them so they look like us,
p55
aVbehave like us, and think like us.
p56
aVThe perfect robot will be indistinguishable
p57
aVfrom the human,
p58
aVand that scares us.
p59
aVIn the first story about robots,
p60
aVthey turn against their creators.
p61
aVIt's one of the leitmotifs of science fiction.
p62
aa(lp63
VEDI: Ha ha ha. Now you are the slaves
p64
aVand we robots, the masters.
p65
aVYour world is ours. You \u2014
p66
aa(lp67
VMT: As I was saying,
p68
aVbesides the faces and bodies we give our robots,
p69
aVwe cannot read their intentions,
p70
aVand that makes us nervous.
p71
aVWhen someone hands an object to you,
p72
aVyou can read intention in their eyes, their face,
p73
aVtheir body language.
p74
aVThat's not true of the robot.
p75
aVNow, this goes both ways.
p76
aa(lp77
VEDI: Wow!
p78
aa(lp79
VMT: Robots cannot anticipate human actions.
p80
aa(lp81
VEDI: You know, humans are so unpredictable,
p82
aVnot to mention irrational.
p83
aVI literally have no idea
p84
aVwhat you guys are going to do next, you know,
p85
aVbut it scares me.
p86
aa(lp87
VMT: Which is why humans and robots find it difficult
p88
aVto work in close proximity.
p89
aVAccidents are inevitable.
p90
aa(lp91
VEDI: Ow! That hurt.
p92
aa(lp93
VMT: Sorry. Now, one way of persuading humans
p94
aVthat robots are safe
p95
aVis to create the illusion of trust.
p96
aVMuch as the Victorians
p97
aVfaked their mechanical marvels,
p98
aVwe can add a layer of deception
p99
aVto help us feel more comfortable
p100
aVwith our robotic friends.
p101
aVWith that in mind, I set about teaching EDI
p102
aVa magic trick.
p103
aVReady, EDI? EDI: Uh, ready, Marco.
p104
aVAbracadabra.
p105
aa(lp106
VMT: Abracadabra?
p107
aa(lp108
VEDI: Yeah. It's all part of the illusion, Marco.
p109
aVCome on, keep up.
p110
aa(lp111
VMT: Magic creates the illusion of
p112
aVan impossible reality.
p113
aVTechnology
p114
aVcan do the same.
p115
aVAlan Turing, a pioneer of artificial intelligence,
p116
aVspoke about creating the illusion
p117
aVthat a machine could think.
p118
aa(lp119
VEDI: A computer would deserve
p120
aVto be called intelligent
p121
aVif it deceived a human into believing
p122
aVit was human.
p123
aa(lp124
VMT: In other words, if we do not yet have
p125
aVthe technological solutions,
p126
aVwould illusions serve the same purpose?
p127
aVTo create the robotic illusion,
p128
aVwe've devised a set of ethical rules,
p129
aVa code that all robots would live by.
p130
aa(lp131
VEDI: A robot may not harm humanity,
p132
aVor by inaction allow humanity to come to harm.
p133
aVThank you, Isaac Asimov.
p134
aa(lp135
VMT: We anthropomorphize our machines.
p136
aVWe give them a friendly face
p137
aVand a reassuring voice.
p138
aa(lp139
VEDI: I am EDI.
p140
aVI became operational at TED in March 2014.
p141
aa(lp142
VMT: We let them entertain us.
p143
aVMost important, we make them indicate
p144
aVthat they are aware of our presence.
p145
aa(lp146
VEDI: Marco, you're standing on my foot!
p147
aa(lp148
VMT: Sorry. They'll be conscious of our fragile frame
p149
aVand move aside if we got too close,
p150
aVand they'll account for our unpredictability
p151
aVand anticipate our actions.
p152
aVAnd now, under the spell of a technological illusion,
p153
aVwe could ignore our fears
p154
aVand truly interact.
