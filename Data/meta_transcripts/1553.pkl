VThere are a lot of ways the people around us
p4
aVcan help improve our lives.
p5
aVWe don't bump into every neighbor,
p6
aVso a lot of wisdom never gets passed on,
p7
aVthough we do share the same public spaces.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo over the past few years, I've tried ways to share more
p10
aVwith my neighbors in public space,
p11
aVusing simple tools like stickers, stencils and chalk.
p12
aVAnd these projects came from questions I had, like:
p13
aVHow much are my neighbors paying for their apartments?
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VHow can we lend and borrow more things,
p18
aVwithout knocking on each other's doors at a bad time?
p19
aVHow can we share more memories of our abandoned buildings,
p20
aVand gain a better understanding of our landscape?
p21
aVHow can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts,
p22
aVso our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today?
p23
aa(lp24
VNow, I live in New Orleans,
p25
aVand I am in love with New Orleans.
p26
aVMy soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees,
p27
aVshading lovers, drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years,
p28
aVand I trust a city that always makes way for music.
p29
aVI feel like every time someone sneezes,
p30
aVNew Orleans has a parade.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VThe city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world,
p35
aVbut it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America.
p36
aa(lp37
VI live near this house,
p38
aVand I thought about how I could make it a nicer space for my neighborhood,
p39
aVand I also thought about something that changed my life forever.
p40
aa(lp41
VIn 2009, I lost someone I loved very much.
p42
aVHer name was Joan, and she was a mother to me.
p43
aVAnd her death was sudden and unexpected.
p44
aVAnd I thought about death a lot.
p45
aVAnd ... this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I've had.
p46
aVAnd ... brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now.
p47
aVBut I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life.
p48
aVI feel like it's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day,
p49
aVand forget what really matters to you.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo with help from old and new friends,
p52
aVI turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard,
p53
aVand stenciled it with a fill-in-the-blank sentence:
p54
aV"Before I die, I want to ..."
p55
aVSo anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk,
p56
aVreflect on their life,
p57
aVand share their personal aspirations in public space.
p58
aa(lp59
VI didn't know what to expect from this experiment,
p60
aVbut by the next day, the wall was entirely filled out,
p61
aVand it kept growing.
p62
aVAnd I'd like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall.
p63
aa(lp64
V"Before I die, I want to be tried for piracy."
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
V"Before I die, I want to straddle the International Dateline."
p69
aa(lp70
V"Before I die, I want to sing for millions."
p71
aa(lp72
V"Before I die, I want to plant a tree."
p73
aa(lp74
V"Before I die, I want to live off the grid."
p75
aa(lp76
V"Before I die, I want to hold her one more time."
p77
aa(lp78
V"Before I die, I want to be someone's cavalry."
p79
aa(lp80
V"Before I die, I want to be completely myself."
p81
aa(lp82
VSo this neglected space became a constructive one,
p83
aVand people's hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud, tear up,
p84
aVand they consoled me during my own tough times.
p85
aVIt's about knowing you're not alone;
p86
aVit's about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways;
p87
aVit's about making space for reflection and contemplation,
p88
aVand remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change.
p89
aa(lp90
VI made this last year,
p91
aVand started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people
p92
aVwho wanted to make a wall with their community.
p93
aVSo, my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit,
p94
aVand now walls have been made in countries around the world,
p95
aVincluding Kazakhstan,
p96
aVSouth Africa,
p97
aVAustralia,
p98
aVArgentina, and beyond.
p99
aVTogether, we've shown how powerful our public spaces can be
p100
aVif we're given the opportunity to have a voice,
p101
aVand share more with one another.
p102
aa(lp103
VTwo of the most valuable things we have
p104
aVare time, and our relationships with other people.
p105
aVIn our age of increasing distractions,
p106
aVit's more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective,
p107
aVand remember that life is brief and tender.
p108
aVDeath is something that we're often discouraged to talk about,
p109
aVor even think about,
p110
aVbut I've realized that preparing for death
p111
aVis one of the most empowering things you can do.
p112
aVThinking about death clarifies your life.
p113
aa(lp114
VOur shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us,
p115
aVas individuals and as a community,
p116
aVand with more ways to share our hopes, fears and stories,
p117
aVthe people around us can not only help us make better places,
p118
aVthey can help us lead better lives.
p119
aa(lp120
VThank you.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Applause)
p123
aa(lp124
VThank you.
