VIf I should have a daughter,
p4
aVinstead of "Mom,"
p5
aVshe's going to call me "Point B,"
p6
aVbecause that way she knows that no matter what happens,
p7
aVat least she can always find her way to me.
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd I'm going to paint solar systems on the backs of her hands
p10
aVso she has to learn the entire universe
p11
aVbefore she can say, "Oh, I know that like the back of my hand."
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd she's going to learn
p14
aVthat this life will hit you hard in the face,
p15
aVwait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach.
p16
aVBut getting the wind knocked out of you
p17
aVis the only way to remind your lungs
p18
aVhow much they like the taste of air.
p19
aVThere is hurt, here,
p20
aVthat cannot be fixed by Band-Aids or poetry.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo the first time she realizes that Wonder Woman isn't coming,
p23
aVI'll make sure she knows
p24
aVshe doesn't have to wear the cape all by herself,
p25
aVbecause no matter how wide you stretch your fingers,
p26
aVyour hands will always be too small
p27
aVto catch all the pain you want to heal.
p28
aVBelieve me, I've tried.
p29
aV"And, baby," I'll tell her,
p30
aVdon't keep your nose up in the air like that.
p31
aVI know that trick; I've done it a million times.
p32
aVYou're just smelling for smoke
p33
aVso you can follow the trail back to a burning house,
p34
aVso you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire
p35
aVto see if you can save him.
p36
aVOr else find the boy who lit the fire in the first place,
p37
aVto see if you can change him.
p38
aVBut I know she will anyway,
p39
aVso instead I'll always keep an extra supply
p40
aVof chocolate and rain boots nearby,
p41
aVbecause there is no heartbreak that chocolate can't fix.
p42
aVOkay, there's a few that chocolate can't fix.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut that's what the rain boots are for,
p45
aVbecause rain will wash away everything, if you let it.
p46
aVI want her to look at the world
p47
aVthrough the underside of a glass-bottom boat,
p48
aVto look through a microscope
p49
aVat the galaxies that exist
p50
aVon the pinpoint of a human mind,
p51
aVbecause that's the way my mom taught me.
p52
aVThat there'll be days like this.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Singing) There'll be days like this, my momma said.
p55
aVWhen you open your hands to catch
p56
aVand wind up with only blisters and bruises;
p57
aVwhen you step out of the phone booth and try to fly
p58
aVand the very people you want to save
p59
aVare the ones standing on your cape;
p60
aVwhen your boots will fill with rain,
p61
aVand you'll be up to your knees in disappointment.
p62
aVAnd those are the very days you have all the more reason to say thank you.
p63
aa(lp64
VBecause there's nothing more beautiful
p65
aVthan the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline,
p66
aVno matter how many times it's sent away.
p67
aVYou will put the wind in win some, lose some.
p68
aVYou will put the star in starting over, and over.
p69
aVAnd no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute,
p70
aVbe sure your mind lands
p71
aVon the beauty of this funny place called life.
p72
aVAnd yes, on a scale from one to over-trusting,
p73
aVI am pretty damn naive.
p74
aVBut I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar.
p75
aVIt can crumble so easily,
p76
aVbut don't be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it.
p77
aa(lp78
V"Baby," I'll tell her, "remember, your momma is a worrier,
p79
aVand your poppa is a warrior,
p80
aVand you are the girl with small hands and big eyes
p81
aVwho never stops asking for more."
p82
aVRemember that good things come in threes
p83
aVand so do bad things.
p84
aVAlways apologize when you've done something wrong,
p85
aVbut don't you ever apologize
p86
aVfor the way your eyes refuse to stop shining.
p87
aVYour voice is small, but don't ever stop singing.
p88
aVAnd when they finally hand you heartache,
p89
aVwhen they slip war and hatred under your door
p90
aVand offer you handouts on street-corners
p91
aVof cynicism and defeat,
p92
aVyou tell them that they really ought to meet your mother.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Applause)
p95
aa(lp96
VThank you. Thank you.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Applause)
p99
aa(lp100
VThank you.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Applause)
p103
aa(lp104
VThanks.
p105
aa(lp106
V(Applause)
p107
aa(lp108
VThank you.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Applause)
p111
aa(lp112
VAll right, so I want you to take a moment,
p113
aVand I want you to think of three things that you know to be true.
p114
aVThey can be about whatever you want \u2014
p115
aVtechnology, entertainment, design,
p116
aVyour family, what you had for breakfast.
p117
aVThe only rule is don't think too hard.
p118
aVOkay, ready? Go.
p119
aVOkay.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo here are three things I know to be true.
p122
aVI know that Jean-Luc Godard was right when he said that,
p123
aV"A good story has a beginning, a middle and an end,
p124
aValthough not necessarily in that order."
p125
aVI know that I'm incredibly nervous and excited to be up here,
p126
aVwhich is greatly inhibiting my ability to keep it cool.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd I know
p131
aVthat I have been waiting all week to tell this joke.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VWhy was the scarecrow invited to TED?
p136
aVBecause he was out standing in his field.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VI'm sorry.
p141
aVOkay, so these are three things I know to be true.
p142
aVBut there are plenty of things I have trouble understanding.
p143
aVSo I write poems to figure things out.
p144
aVSometimes the only way I know how to work through something
p145
aVis by writing a poem.
p146
aVSometimes I get to the end of the poem,
p147
aVlook back and go, "Oh, that's what this is all about,"
p148
aVand sometimes I get to the end of the poem
p149
aVand haven't solved anything,
p150
aVbut at least I have a new poem out of it.
p151
aa(lp152
VSpoken-word poetry is the art of performance poetry.
p153
aVI tell people it involves creating poetry
p154
aVthat doesn't just want to sit on paper,
p155
aVthat something about it demands it be heard out loud
p156
aVor witnessed in person.
p157
aa(lp158
VWhen I was a freshman in high school,
p159
aVI was a live wire of nervous hormones.
p160
aVAnd I was underdeveloped and over-excitable.
p161
aVAnd despite my fear
p162
aVof ever being looked at for too long,
p163
aVI was fascinated by the idea of spoken-word poetry.
p164
aVI felt that my two secret loves, poetry and theater,
p165
aVhad come together, had a baby,
p166
aVa baby I needed to get to know.
p167
aVSo I decided to give it a try.
p168
aVMy first spoken-word poem,
p169
aVpacked with all the wisdom of a 14-year-old,
p170
aVwas about the injustice
p171
aVof being seen as unfeminine.
p172
aVThe poem was very indignant,
p173
aVand mainly exaggerated,
p174
aVbut the only spoken-word poetry that I had seen up until that point
p175
aVwas mainly indignant,
p176
aVso I thought that's what was expected of me.
p177
aa(lp178
VThe first time that I performed,
p179
aVthe audience of teenagers hooted and hollered their sympathy,
p180
aVand when I came off the stage, I was shaking.
p181
aVI felt this tap on my shoulder,
p182
aVand I turned around to see
p183
aVthis giant girl in a hoodie sweatshirt emerge from the crowd.
p184
aVShe was maybe eight feet tall
p185
aVand looked like she could beat me up with one hand,
p186
aVbut instead she just nodded at me and said,
p187
aV"Hey, I really felt that. Thanks."
p188
aVAnd lightning struck.
p189
aVI was hooked.
p190
aa(lp191
VI discovered this bar on Manhattan's Lower East Side
p192
aVthat hosted a weekly poetry open Mic,
p193
aVand my bewildered, but supportive, parents took me
p194
aVto soak in every ounce of spoken word that I could.
p195
aVI was the youngest by at least a decade,
p196
aVbut somehow the poets at the Bowery Poetry Club
p197
aVdidn't seem bothered by the 14-year-old wandering about.
p198
aVIn fact, they welcomed me.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd it was here, listening to these poets share their stories,
p201
aVthat I learned that spoken-word poetry didn't have to be indignant,
p202
aVit could be fun or painful
p203
aVor serious or silly.
p204
aVThe Bowery Poetry Club became my classroom and my home,
p205
aVand the poets who performed
p206
aVencouraged me to share my stories as well.
p207
aVNever mind the fact that I was 14.
p208
aVThey told me, "Write about being 14."
p209
aVSo I did and stood amazed every week
p210
aVwhen these brilliant, grown-up poets
p211
aVlaughed with me and groaned their sympathy
p212
aVand clapped and told me, "Hey, I really felt that too."
p213
aa(lp214
VNow I can divide my spoken-word journey
p215
aVinto three steps.
p216
aVStep one was the moment I said,
p217
aV"I can. I can do this."
p218
aVAnd that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie.
p219
aVStep two was the moment I said,
p220
aV"I will. I will continue.
p221
aVI love spoken word. I will keep coming back week after week."
p222
aVAnd step three began
p223
aVwhen I realized I didn't have to write indignant poems,
p224
aVif that's not what I was.
p225
aVThere were things that were specific to me,
p226
aVand the more that I focused on those things,
p227
aVthe weirder my poetry got,
p228
aVbut the more that it felt like mine.
p229
aVIt's not just the adage "Write what you know."
p230
aVIt's about gathering up all of the knowledge and experience
p231
aVyou've collected up to now
p232
aVto help you dive into the things you don't know.
p233
aVI use poetry to help me work through what I don't understand,
p234
aVbut I show up to each new poem
p235
aVwith a backpack full of everywhere else that I've been.
p236
aa(lp237
VWhen I got to university, I met a fellow poet
p238
aVwho shared my belief in the magic of spoken-word poetry.
p239
aVAnd actually, Phil Kaye and I
p240
aVcoincidentally also share the same last name.
p241
aVWhen I was in high school I had created Project V.O.I.C.E.
p242
aVas a way to encourage my friends to do spoken word with me.
p243
aVBut Phil and I decided to reinvent Project V.O.I.C.E.,
p244
aVthis time changing the mission
p245
aVto using spoken-word poetry as a way to entertain,
p246
aVeducate and inspire.
p247
aVWe stayed full-time students, but in between we traveled,
p248
aVperforming and teaching
p249
aVnine-year-olds to MFA candidates,
p250
aVfrom California to Indiana to India
p251
aVto a public high school just up the street from campus.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd we saw over and over
p254
aVthe way that spoken-word poetry
p255
aVcracks open locks.
p256
aVBut it turns out sometimes, poetry can be really scary.
p257
aVTurns out sometimes,
p258
aVyou have to trick teenagers into writing poetry.
p259
aVSo I came up with lists. Everyone can write lists.
p260
aVAnd the first list that I assign
p261
aVis "10 Things I Know to be True."
p262
aVAnd here's what happens, you would discover it too
p263
aVif we all started sharing our lists out loud.
p264
aVAt a certain point, you would realize that someone has the exact same thing,
p265
aVor one thing very similar,
p266
aVto something on your list.
p267
aVAnd then someone else
p268
aVhas something the complete opposite of yours.
p269
aVThird, someone has something you've never even heard of before.
p270
aVFourth, someone has something you thought you knew everything about,
p271
aVbut they're introducing a new angle of looking at it.
p272
aVAnd I tell people that this is where great stories start from \u2014
p273
aVthese four intersections
p274
aVof what you're passionate about
p275
aVand what others might be invested in.
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd most people respond really well to this exercise.
p278
aVBut one of my students, a freshman named Charlotte,
p279
aVwas not convinced.
p280
aVCharlotte was very good at writing lists, but she refused to write any poems.
p281
aV"Miss," she'd say, "I'm just not interesting.
p282
aVI don't have anything interesting to say."
p283
aVSo I assigned her list after list,
p284
aVand one day I assigned the list
p285
aV"10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now."
p286
aVNumber three on Charlotte's list was,
p287
aV"I should have learned not to crush on guys
p288
aVthree times my age."
p289
aVI asked her what that meant,
p290
aVand she said, "Miss, it's kind of a long story."
p291
aVAnd I said, "Charlotte, it sounds pretty interesting to me."
p292
aVAnd so she wrote her first poem,
p293
aVa love poem unlike any I had ever heard before.
p294
aVAnd the poem began,
p295
aV"Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man."
p296
aa(lp297
V(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
V"Did you see him on 60 Minutes,
p300
aVracing Michael Phelps in a pool \u2014
p301
aVnothing but swim trunks on \u2014
p302
aVdiving in the water, determined to beat this swimming champion?
p303
aVAfter the race, he tossed his wet, cloud-white hair
p304
aVand said, 'You're a god.'
p305
aVNo, Anderson, you're the god."
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
V(Applause)
p310
aa(lp311
VNow, I know that the number one rule to being cool
p312
aVis to seem unfazed,
p313
aVto never admit that anything scares you
p314
aVor impresses you or excites you.
p315
aVSomebody once told me
p316
aVit's like walking through life like this.
p317
aVYou protect yourself
p318
aVfrom all the unexpected miseries or hurt that might show up.
p319
aVBut I try to walk through life like this.
p320
aVAnd yes, that means catching all of those miseries and hurt,
p321
aVbut it also means that when beautiful, amazing things
p322
aVjust fall out of the sky,
p323
aVI'm ready to catch them.
p324
aVI use spoken word to help my students
p325
aVrediscover wonder,
p326
aVto fight their instincts to be cool and unfazed
p327
aVand, instead, actively pursue being engaged with what goes on around them,
p328
aVso that they can reinterpret and create something from it.
p329
aa(lp330
VIt's not that I think that spoken-word poetry
p331
aVis the ideal art form.
p332
aVI'm always trying to find the best way to tell each story.
p333
aVI write musicals; I make short films alongside my poems.
p334
aVBut I teach spoken-word poetry
p335
aVbecause it's accessible.
p336
aVNot everyone can read music or owns a camera,
p337
aVbut everyone can communicate in some way,
p338
aVand everyone has stories that the rest of us can learn from.
p339
aVPlus, spoken-word poetry allows for immediate connection.
p340
aVIt's not uncommon to feel like you're alone
p341
aVor that nobody understands you,
p342
aVbut spoken word teaches
p343
aVthat if you have the ability to express yourself
p344
aVand the courage to present those stories and opinions,
p345
aVyou could be rewarded
p346
aVwith a room full of your peers,
p347
aVor your community, who will listen.
p348
aVAnd maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie
p349
aVwho will connect with what you've shared.
p350
aVAnd that is an amazing realization to have,
p351
aVespecially when you're 14.
p352
aVPlus, now with YouTube,
p353
aVthat connection's not even limited to the room we're in.
p354
aVI'm so lucky that there's this archive of performances
p355
aVthat I can share with my students.
p356
aVIt allows for even more opportunities
p357
aVfor them to find a poet or a poem that they connect to.
p358
aa(lp359
VOnce you've figured this out,
p360
aVit is tempting to keep writing the same poem,
p361
aVor keep telling the same story, over and over,
p362
aVonce you've figured out that it will gain you applause.
p363
aVIt's not enough to just teach that you can express yourself.
p364
aVYou have to grow and explore
p365
aVand take risks and challenge yourself.
p366
aVAnd that is step three:
p367
aVinfusing the work you're doing
p368
aVwith the specific things that make you you,
p369
aVeven while those things are always changing.
p370
aVBecause step three never ends.
p371
aVBut you don't get to start on step three,
p372
aVuntil you take step one first:
p373
aV"I can."
p374
aa(lp375
VI travel a lot while I'm teaching,
p376
aVand I don't always get to watch all of my students reach their step three,
p377
aVbut I was very lucky with Charlotte,
p378
aVthat I got to watch her journey unfold the way it did.
p379
aVI watched her realize
p380
aVthat, by putting the things that she knows to be true into the work she's doing,
p381
aVshe can create poems that only Charlotte can write,
p382
aVabout eyeballs and elevators and Dora the Explorer.
p383
aVAnd I'm trying to tell stories only I can tell \u2014
p384
aVlike this story.
p385
aVI spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to tell this story,
p386
aVand I wondered if the best way
p387
aVwas going to be a PowerPoint, a short film \u2014
p388
aVAnd where exactly was the beginning, the middle or the end?
p389
aVI wondered whether I'd get to the end of this talk
p390
aVand finally have figured it all out, or not.
p391
aa(lp392
VAnd I always thought that my beginning was at the Bowery Poetry Club,
p393
aVbut it's possible that it was much earlier.
p394
aVIn preparing for TED,
p395
aVI discovered this diary page in an old journal.
p396
aVI think December 54th was probably supposed to be 24th.
p397
aVIt's clear that when I was a child,
p398
aVI definitely walked through life like this.
p399
aVI think that we all did.
p400
aVI would like to help others rediscover that wonder \u2014
p401
aVto want to engage with it, to want to learn,
p402
aVto want to share what they've learned,
p403
aVwhat they've figured out to be true
p404
aVand what they're still figuring out.
p405
aa(lp406
VSo I'd like to close with this poem.
p407
aa(lp408
VWhen they bombed Hiroshima,
p409
aVthe explosion formed a mini-supernova,
p410
aVso every living animal, human or plant
p411
aVthat received direct contact with the rays from that sun
p412
aVwas instantly turned to ash.
p413
aVAnd what was left of the city soon followed.
p414
aVThe long-lasting damage of nuclear radiation
p415
aVcaused an entire city and its population
p416
aVto turn into powder.
p417
aVWhen I was born, my mom says I looked around the whole hospital room
p418
aVwith a stare that said, "This? I've done this before."
p419
aVShe says I have old eyes.
p420
aVWhen my Grandpa Genji died, I was only five years old,
p421
aVbut I took my mom by the hand and told her,
p422
aV"Don't worry, he'll come back as a baby."
p423
aVAnd yet, for someone who's apparently done this already,
p424
aVI still haven't figured anything out yet.
p425
aVMy knees still buckle every time I get on a stage.
p426
aVMy self-confidence can be measured out
p427
aVin teaspoons mixed into my poetry,
p428
aVand it still always tastes funny in my mouth.
p429
aVBut in Hiroshima, some people were wiped clean away,
p430
aVleaving only a wristwatch or a diary page.
p431
aVSo no matter that I have inhibitions to fill all my pockets,
p432
aVI keep trying,
p433
aVhoping that one day I'll write a poem
p434
aVI can be proud to let sit in a museum exhibit
p435
aVas the only proof I existed.
p436
aVMy parents named me Sarah, which is a biblical name.
p437
aVIn the original story, God told Sarah she could do something impossible, and \u2014
p438
aVshe laughed,
p439
aVbecause the first Sarah,
p440
aVshe didn't know what to do with impossible.
p441
aVAnd me?
p442
aVWell, neither do I,
p443
aVbut I see the impossible every day.
p444
aVImpossible is trying to connect in this world,
p445
aVtrying to hold onto others while things are blowing up around you,
p446
aVknowing that while you're speaking,
p447
aVthey aren't just waiting for their turn to talk \u2014 they hear you.
p448
aVThey feel exactly what you feel
p449
aVat the same time that you feel it.
p450
aVIt's what I strive for every time I open my mouth \u2014
p451
aVthat impossible connection.
p452
aVThere's this piece of wall in Hiroshima
p453
aVthat was completely burnt black by the radiation.
p454
aVBut on the front step, a person who was sitting there
p455
aVblocked the rays from hitting the stone.
p456
aVThe only thing left now
p457
aVis a permanent shadow of positive light.
p458
aVAfter the A-bomb,
p459
aVspecialists said it would take 75 years

aVfor the radiation-damaged soil of Hiroshima City
p461
aVto ever grow anything again.
p462
aVBut that spring, there were new buds popping up from the earth.
p463
aVWhen I meet you, in that moment,
p464
aVI'm no longer a part of your future.
p465
aVI start quickly becoming part of your past.
p466
aVBut in that instant, I get to share your present.
p467
aVAnd you, you get to share mine.
p468
aVAnd that is the greatest present of all.
p469
aVSo if you tell me I can do the impossible \u2014
p470
aVI'll probably laugh at you.
p471

p479
aVto get it right this time around.
