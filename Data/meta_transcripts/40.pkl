VNature's my muse and it's been my passion.
p4
aVAs a photographer for National Geographic, I've portrayed it for many.
p5
aVBut five years ago, I went on a personal journey.
p6
aVI wanted to visualize the story of life.
p7
aVIt's the hardest thing I've ever attempted,
p8
aVand there have been plenty of times when I felt like backing out.
p9
aVBut there were also revelations.
p10
aVAnd one of those I'd like to share with you today.
p11
aa(lp12
VI went down to a remote lagoon in Australia, hoping to see the Earth
p13
aVthe way it was three billion years ago,
p14
aVback before the sky turned blue.
p15
aVThere's stromatolites down there \u2014
p16
aVthe first living things to capture photosynthesis \u2014
p17
aVand it's the only place they still occur today.
p18
aVGoing down there was like entering a time capsule,
p19
aVand I came out with a different sense of myself in time.
p20
aVThe oxygen exhaled by those stromatolites
p21
aVis what we all breathe today.
p22
aa(lp23
VStromatolites are the heroes in my story.
p24
aVI hope it's a story that has some resonance for our time.
p25
aVIt's a story about you and me, nature and science.
p26
aVAnd with that said, I'd like to invite you for
p27
aVa short, brief journey of life through time.
p28
aVOur journey starts in space, where matter condenses into spheres over time ...
p29
aVsolidifying into surface, molded by fire.
p30
aVThe fire gave way, Earth emerged \u2014 but this was an alien planet.
p31
aVThe moon was closer; things were different.
p32
aVHeat from within made geysers erupt \u2014 that is how the oceans were born.
p33
aVWater froze around the poles and shaped the edges of the Earth.
p34
aVWater is the key to life, but in frozen form, it is a latent force.
p35
aVAnd when it vanishes, Earth becomes Mars.
p36
aa(lp37
VBut this planet is different \u2014 it's roiling inside.
p38
aVAnd where that energy touches water, something new emerges: life.
p39
aVIt arises around cracks in the Earth.
p40
aVMud and minerals become substrate; there are bacteria.
p41
aVLearn to multiply, thickening in places ...
p42
aVGrowing living structures under an alien sky ...
p43
aVStromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen.
p44
aVAnd they changed the atmosphere.
p45
aVA breath that's fossilized now as iron.
p46
aa(lp47
VMeteorites delivered chemistry, and perhaps membranes, too.
p48
aVLife needs a membrane to contain itself
p49
aVso it can replicate and mutate.
p50
aVThese are diatoms, single-celled phytoplankton
p51
aVwith skeletons of silicon ...
p52
aVcircuit boards of the future.
p53
aVShallow seas nurtured life early on, and that's where it morphed
p54
aVinto more complex forms.
p55
aVIt grew as light and oxygen increased.
p56
aVLife hardened and became defensive.
p57
aVIt learned to move and began to see. The first eyes grew on trilobites.
p58
aVVision was refined in horseshoe crabs,
p59
aVamong the first to leave the sea.
p60
aVThey still do what they've done for ages, their enemies long gone.
p61
aa(lp62
VScorpions follow prey out of the sea. Slugs became snails.
p63
aVFish tried amphibian life. Frogs adapted to deserts.
p64
aVLichens arose as a co-op. Fungi married algae ...
p65
aVclinging to rock, and eating it too ... transforming barren land.
p66
aVTrue land plants arose, leafless at first.
p67
aVOnce they learn how to stay upright, they grew in size and shape.
p68
aVThe fundamental forms of ferns followed,
p69
aVto bear spores that foreshadowed seeds.
p70
aVLife flourished in swamps.
p71
aa(lp72
VOn land, life turned a corner. Jaws formed first; teeth came later.
p73
aVLeatherbacks and tuataras are echoes from that era.
p74
aVIt took time for life to break away from water,
p75
aVand it still beckons all the time.
p76
aVLife turned hard so it could venture inland.
p77
aVAnd the dragons that arose are still among us today.
p78
aVJurassic Park still shimmers in part of Madagascar,
p79
aVand the center of Brazil,
p80
aVwhere plants called "cycads" remain rock hard.
p81
aVForests arose and nurtured things with wings.
p82
aVOne early form left an imprint, like it died only yesterday.
p83
aVAnd others fly today like echoes of the past.
p84
aVIn birds, life gained new mobility.
p85
aVFlamingos covered continents. Migrations got underway.
p86
aa(lp87
VBirds witnessed the emergence of flowering plants.
p88
aVWater lilies were among the first.
p89
aVPlants began to diversify and grew, turning into trees.
p90
aVIn Australia, a lily turned into a grass tree,
p91
aVand in Hawaii, a daisy became a silver sword.
p92
aVIn Africa, Gondwana molded Proteas.
p93
aVBut when that ancient continent broke up, life got lusher.
p94
aVTropical rainforests arose, sparking new layers of interdependence.
p95
aVFungi multiplied. Orchids emerged, genitalia shaped to lure insects ...
p96
aVa trick shared by the largest flower on Earth.
p97
aVCo-evolution entwined insects and birds and plants forever.
p98
aVWhen birds can't fly, they become vulnerable.
p99
aVKiwis are, and so are these hawks trapped near Antarctica.
p100
aa(lp101
VExtinction can come slowly, but sometimes it arrives fast.
p102
aVAn asteroid hits, and the world went down in flames.
p103
aVBut there were witnesses, survivors in the dark.
p104
aVWhen the skies cleared, a new world was born.
p105
aVA world fit for mammals. From tiny shrews [came]
p106
aVtenrecs, accustomed to the dark.
p107
aVNew forms became bats. Civets.
p108
aVNew predators, hyenas, getting faster and faster still.
p109
aa(lp110
VGrasslands created opportunities.
p111
aVHerd safety came with sharpened senses.
p112
aVGrowing big was another answer, but size always comes at a price.
p113
aVSome mammals turned back to water.
p114
aVWalruses adapted with layers of fat. Sea lions got sleek.
p115
aVAnd cetaceans moved into a world without bounds.
p116
aVThere are many ways to be a mammal. A 'roo hops in Oz;
p117
aVa horse runs in Asia; and a wolf evolves stilt legs in Brazil.
p118
aVPrimates emerge from jungles, as tarsiers first,
p119
aVbecoming lemurs not much later.
p120
aVLearning became reinforced. Bands of apes ventured into the open.
p121
aVAnd forests dried out once more. Going upright became a lifestyle.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo who are we? Brothers of masculine chimps,
p124
aVsisters of feminine bonobos? We are all of them, and more.
p125
aVWe're molded by the same life force.
p126
aVThe blood veins in our hands
p127
aVechoed a course of water traces on the Earth.
p128
aVAnd our brains \u2014 our celebrated brains \u2014
p129
aVreflect a drainage of a tidal marsh.
p130
aa(lp131
VLife is a force in its own right. It is a new element.
p132
aVAnd it has altered the Earth. It covers Earth like a skin.
p133
aVAnd where it doesn't, as in Greenland in winter,
p134
aVMars is still not very far.
p135
aVBut that likelihood fades as long as ice melts again.
p136
aVAnd where water is liquid, it becomes a womb
p137
aVfor cells green with chlorophyll \u2014 and that molecular marvel
p138
aVis what's made a difference \u2014 it powers everything.
p139
aVThe whole animal world today lives on a stockpile
p140
aVof bacterial oxygen that is cycled constantly
p141
aVthrough plants and algae, and their waste is our breath,
p142
aVand vice versa.
p143
aVThis Earth is alive, and it's made its own membrane.
p144
aVWe call it "atmosphere." This is the icon of our journey.
p145
aVAnd you all here today can imagine and will shape where we go next.
p146
aV(Applause)
p147
aVThank you. Thank you.
