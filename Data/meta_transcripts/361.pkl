VI grew up in Northern Ireland, right up in the
p4
aVvery, very north end of it there,
p5
aVwhere it's absolutely freezing cold.
p6
aVThis was me running around in the back garden mid-summer.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VI couldn't pick a career.
p11
aVIn Ireland the obvious choice is the military,
p12
aVbut to be honest it actually kind of sucks.
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VMy mother wanted me to be a dentist.
p17
aVBut the problem was that people kept blowing everything up.
p18
aVSo I actually went to school in Belfast,
p19
aVwhich was where all the action happened.
p20
aVAnd this was a pretty common sight.
p21
aVThe school I went to was pretty boring.
p22
aVThey forced us to learn things like Latin.
p23
aVThe school teachers weren't having much fun,
p24
aVthe sports were very dirty or very painful.
p25
aVSo I cleverly chose rowing, which I got very good at.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd I was actually rowing for my school here
p28
aVuntil this fateful day, and I flipped over right in front
p29
aVof the entire school.
p30
aVAnd that was the finishing post right there.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VSo this was extremely embarrassing.
p35
aVBut our school at that time got a grant from the government,
p36
aVand they got an incredible computer \u2014 the research machine 3DZ \u2014
p37
aVand they left the programming manuals lying around.
p38
aVAnd so students like myself with nothing to do,
p39
aVwe would learn how to program it.
p40
aVAlso around this time, at home,
p41
aVthis was the computer that people were buying.
p42
aVIt was called the Sinclair ZX80. This was a 1K computer,
p43
aVand you'd buy your programs on cassette tape.
p44
aa(lp45
VActually I'm just going to pause for one second,
p46
aVbecause I heard that there's a prerequisite to speak here at TED \u2014
p47
aVyou had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair.
p48
aVSo I brought a picture with big hair.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter).
p51
aa(lp52
VI just want to get that out of the way.
p53
aVSo after the Sinclair ZX80 came along the very cleverly named
p54
aVSinclair ZX81.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd \u2014 you see the picture at the bottom?
p59
aVThere's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son.
p60
aVThat's what they thought they had built it for.
p61
aVThe reality is we got the programming manual
p62
aVand we started making games for it.
p63
aVWe were programming in BASIC,
p64
aVwhich is a pretty awful language for games,
p65
aVso we ended up learning Assembly language
p66
aVso we could really take control of the hardware.
p67
aVThis is the guy that invented it, Sir Clive Sinclair,
p68
aVand he's showing his machine.
p69
aVYou had this same thing in America,
p70
aVit was called the Timex Sinclair1000.
p71
aa(lp72
VTo play a game in those days you had to have an imagination
p73
aVto believe that you were really playing "Battlestar Galactica."
p74
aVThe graphics were just horrible.
p75
aVYou had to have an even better imagination to play this game,
p76
aV"Death Rider."
p77
aVBut of course the scientists couldn't help themselves.
p78
aVThey started making their own video games.
p79
aVThis is one of my favorite ones here, where they have rabbit breeding,
p80
aVso males choose the lucky rabbit.
p81
aa(lp82
VIt was around this time we went from 1K to 16K,
p83
aVwhich was quite the leap.
p84
aVAnd if you're wondering how much 16K is,
p85
aVthis eBay logo here is 16K.
p86
aVAnd in that amount of memory someone programmed
p87
aVa full flight simulation program.
p88
aVAnd that's what it looked like.
p89
aVI spent ages flying this flight simulator,
p90
aVand I honestly believed I could fly airplanes by the end of it.
p91
aa(lp92
VHere's Clive Sinclair now launching his color computer.
p93
aVHe's recognized as being the father of video games in Europe.
p94
aVHe's a multi-millionaire, and I think that's why he's
p95
aVsmiling in this photograph.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo I went on for the next 20 years or so
p98
aVmaking a lot of different games.
p99
aVSome of the highlights were things like "The Terminator,"
p100
aV"Aladdin," the "Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles."
p101
aVBecause I was from the United Kingdom,
p102
aVthey thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children,
p103
aVso they decided to call it hero instead.
p104
aVI personally preferred the Spanish version,
p105
aVwhich was "Tortugas Ninja."
p106
aVThat was much better.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VThen the last game I did was based on trying to get the video game industry
p111
aVand Hollywood to actually work together on something \u2014
p112
aVinstead of licensing from each other, to actually work.
p113
aa(lp114
VNow, Chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me,
p115
aVso I've done that.
p116
aVThe video game industry in 2005 became a 29 billion dollar business.
p117
aVIt grows every year.
p118
aVLast year was the biggest year.
p119
aVBy 2008, we're going to kick the butt of the music industry.
p120
aVBy 2010, we're going to hit 42 billion.
p121
aV43 percent of gamers are female.
p122
aVSo there's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware.
p123
aa(lp124
VThe average age of gamers?
p125
aVWell, obviously it's for children, right?
p126
aVWell, no, actually it's 30 years old.
p127
aVAnd interestingly, the people who buy the most games are 37.
p128
aVSo 37 is our target audience.
p129
aVAll video games are violent.
p130
aVOf course the newspapers love to beat on this.
p131
aVBut 83 percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever,
p132
aVso it's just not true.
p133
aa(lp134
VOnline gaming statistics.
p135
aVI brought some stuff on "World of Warcraft." It's 5.5 million players.
p136
aVIt makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions.
p137
aVIt costs 50 bucks just to install it on your computer,
p138
aVmaking the publisher about another 275 million.
p139
aVThe game costs about 80 million dollars to make,
p140
aVso basically it pays for itself in about a month.
p141
aVA player in a game called "Project Entropia"
p142
aVactually bought his own island for 26,500 dollars.
p143
aVYou have to remember that this is not a real island.
p144
aVHe didn't actually buy anything, just some data.
p145
aVBut he got great terms on it.
p146
aVThis purchase included mining and hunting rights,
p147
aVownership of all land on the island, and a castle
p148
aVwith no furniture included.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VThis market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually.
p153
aVAnd what's interesting about it is the market was actually created
p154
aVby the gamers themselves.
p155
aVThey found clever ways to trade items
p156
aVand to sell their accounts to each other
p157
aVso that they could make money while they were playing their games.
p158
aVI dove onto eBay a couple of days ago
p159
aVjust to see what was gong on, typed in World of Warcraft, got 6,000 items.
p160
aVI liked this one the best:
p161
aVa level 60 Warlock with lots of epics for 174,000 dollars.
p162
aVIt's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo as far as popularity of games,
p165
aVwhat do you think these people are doing here?
p166
aVIt turns out they're actually in Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles
p167
aVlistening to the L.A. Philharmonic playing video game music.
p168
aVThat's what the show looks like.
p169
aVYou would expect it to be cheesy, but it's not.
p170
aVIt's very, very epic and a very beautiful concert.
p171
aVAnd the people that went there absolutely loved it.
p172
aa(lp173
VWhat do you think these people are doing?
p174
aVThey're actually bringing their computers so they can play games
p175
aVagainst each other.
p176
aVAnd this is happening in every city around the world.
p177
aVThis is happening in your local cities too,
p178
aVyou're probably just not aware of it.
p179
aa(lp180
VNow, Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago
p181
aVhere just to show how video game graphics have been improving.
p182
aVI wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it.
p183
aVBut what I want you to do is to try to understand it.
p184
aVWe're on this curve, and the graphics are getting
p185
aVso ridiculously better.
p186
aVAnd I'm going to show you up to maybe 2007.
p187
aVBut I want you to try and think about what games could look like
p188
aV10 years from now.
p189
aVSo we're going to start that video.
p190
aa(lp191
VVideo: Throughout human history people have played games.
p192
aVAs man's intellect and technology have evolved
p193
aVso too have the games he plays.
p194
aa(lp195
V(Music)
p196
aa(lp197
V(Applause)
p198
aa(lp199
VDavid Perry: The thing again I want you to think about is,
p200
aVdon't look at these graphics and think of that's the way it is.
p201
aVThink about that's where we are right now,
p202
aVand the curve that we're on means that this is going to continue
p203
aVto get better.
p204
aVThis is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw
p205
aVif you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today.
p206
aVYou need to be really an incredible artist.
p207
aVAnd once we get enough of those guys, we're going to want
p208
aVmore fantasy artists that can create places
p209
aVwe've never been to before, or characters that
p210
aVwe've just never seen before.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio.
p213
aVBut if you were to go to a game developers conference,
p214
aVwhat they're all talking about is emotion, purpose,
p215
aVmeaning, understanding and feeling.
p216
aVYou'll hear about talks like, can a video game make you cry?
p217
aVAnd these are the kind of topics we really actually care about.
p218
aa(lp219
VI came across a student who's absolutely excellent
p220
aVat expressing himself, and this student agreed
p221
aVthat he would not show his video to anybody until
p222
aVyou here at TED had seen it.
p223
aVSo I'd like to play this video.
p224
aVSo this is a student's opinion on what his experience of games are.
p225
aa(lp226
VVideo: I, like many of you, live somewhere between
p227
aVreality and video games.
p228
aVSome part of me \u2014 a true living, breathing person \u2014
p229
aVhas become programmed, electronic and virtual.
p230
aVThe boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasy
p231
aVhas finally begun to crumble.
p232
aVI'm a video game addict and this is my story.
p233
aa(lp234
V(Music)
p235
aa(lp236
VIn the year of my birth
p237
aVthe Nintendo Entertainment System also went into development.
p238
aVI played in the backyard, learned to read,
p239
aVand even ate some of my vegetables.
p240
aVMost of my childhood was spent playing with Legos.
p241
aVBut as was the case for most of my generation,
p242
aVI spent a lot of time in front of the TV.
p243
aVMr. Rogers, Walt Disney, Nick Junior,
p244
aVand roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedly
p245
aVleft their mark on me.
p246
aa(lp247
VWhen my parents bought my sister and I our first Nintendo,
p248
aVwhatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive
p249
aVelectronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me.
p250
aVAt some point something clicked.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Music)
p253
aa(lp254
VWith the combination of simple, interactive stories
p255
aVand the warmth of the TV set, my simple 16-bit Nintendo
p256
aVbecame more than just an escape.
p257
aVIt became an alternate existence, my virtual reality.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Music)
p260
aa(lp261
VI'm a video game addict, and it's not because of
p262
aVa certain number of hours I have spent playing,
p263
aVor nights I have gone without sleep to finish the next level.
p264
aVIt is because I have had life-altering experiences in virtual space,
p265
aVand video games had begun to erode my own understanding
p266
aVof what is real and what is not.
p267
aVI'm addicted, because even though I know I'm losing my grip on reality,
p268
aVI still crave more.
p269
aa(lp270
V(Music)
p271
aa(lp272
VFrom an early age I learned to invest myself emotionally
p273
aVin what unfolded before me on screen.
p274
aVToday, after 20 years of watching TV geared to make me emotional,
p275
aVeven a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes.
p276
aVI am just one of a new generation that is growing up.
p277
aVA generation who may experience much more meaning
p278
aVthrough video games than they will through the real world.
p279
aVVideo games are nearing an evolutionary leap,
p280
aVa point where game worlds will look and feel just as real
p281
aVas the films we see in theatres, or the news we watch on TV.
p282
aVAnd while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds
p283
aVmay still be limited, what I do learn applies to my real life.
p284
aVPlay enough video games and eventually you will
p285
aVreally believe you can snowboard, fly a plane,
p286
aVdrive a nine-second quarter mile, or kill a man.
p287
aVI know I can.
p288
aa(lp289
VUnlike any pop culture phenomenon before it,
p290
aVvideo games actually allow us to become part of the machine.
p291
aVThey allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive,
p292
aVdownloaded, streaming, HD reality.
p293
aVWe are interacting with our entertainment.
p294
aVI have come to expect this level of interaction.
p295
aVWithout it, the problems faced in the real world \u2014
p296
aVpoverty, war, disease and genocide \u2014 lack the levity they should.
p297
aVTheir importance blends into the sensationalized drama
p298
aVof prime time TV.
p299
aa(lp300
VBut the beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics,
p301
aVthe vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound.
p302
aVIt lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional.
p303
aVI have fought in wars, feared for my own survival,
p304
aVwatched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel
p305
aVmore real than any textbook or any news story.
p306
aa(lp307
VThe people who create these games are smart.
p308
aVThey know what makes me scared, excited, panicked, proud or sad.
p309
aVThen they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create.
p310
aVA well-designed video game will seamlessly
p311
aVweave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience.
p312
aVAs one becomes more experienced
p313
aVthe awareness of physical control melts away.
p314
aVI know what I want and I do it.
p315
aVNo buttons to push, no triggers to pull, just me and the game.
p316
aVMy fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands.
p317
aVI know violent video games make my mother worry.
p318
aVWhat troubles me is not that video game violence
p319
aVis becoming more and more like real life violence,
p320
aVbut that real life violence is starting to look more and more
p321
aVlike a video game.
p322
aa(lp323
V(Music)
p324
aa(lp325
VThese are all troubles outside of myself.
p326
aVI, however, have a problem very close to home.
p327
aVSomething has happened to my brain.
p328
aa(lp329
V(Music)
p330
aa(lp331
VPerhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds
p332
aVall of our gut instincts, the things we know to do
p333
aVbefore we even think.
p334
aVWhile some of these instincts may be innate, most are learned,
p335
aVand all of them are hardwired into our brains.
p336
aVThese instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds.
p337
aVOnly in recent years has the technology behind video games
p338
aVallowed for a true overlap in stimuli.
p339
aVAs gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics
p340
aVin the same cities and doing many of the same things
p341
aVwe once did in real life, only virtually.
p342
aVConsider this \u2014
p343
aVmy real life car has about 25,000 miles on it.
p344
aVIn all my driving games, I've driven a total of 31,459 miles.
p345
aVTo some degree I've learned how to drive from the game.
p346
aVThe sensory cues are very similar.
p347
aVIt's a funny feeling when you have spent more time
p348
aVdoing something on the TV than you have in real life.
p349
aVWhen I am driving down a road at sunset all I can think is,
p350
aVthis is almost as beautiful as my games are.
p351
aa(lp352
VFor my virtual worlds are perfect.
p353
aVMore beautiful and rich than the real world around us.
p354
aVI'm not sure what the implications of my experience are,
p355
aVbut the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition
p356
aVon a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me.
p357
aVToday I believe Big Brother would find much more success
p358
aVbrainwashing the masses with video games
p359
aVrather than just simply TVs.
p360
aVVideo games are fun, engaging, and leave your brain
p361
aVcompletely vulnerable to re-programming.
p362
aVBut maybe brainwashing isn't always bad.
p363
aa(lp364
VImagine a game that teaches us to respect each other,
p365
aVor helps us to understand the problems we're all facing
p366
aVin the real world.
p367
aVThere is a potential to do good as well.
p368
aVIt is critical, as these virtual worlds continue to mirror
p369
aVthe real world we live in, that game developers realize
p370
aVthat they have tremendous responsibilities before them.
p371
aVI'm not sure what the future of video games holds
p372
aVfor our civilization.
p373
aVBut as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap
p374
aVthere is a greater and greater potential for other people
p375
aVto feel the same way I do.
p376
aa(lp377
VWhat I have only recently come to realize
p378
aVis that beyond the graphics, sound, game play and emotion
p379
aVit is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating
p380
aVand addictive to me.
p381
aVI know that I am losing my grip.
p382
aVPart of me is just waiting to let go.
p383
aVI know though, that no matter how amazing video games may become,
p384
aVor how flat the real world may seem to us,
p385
aVthat we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us
p386
aVand how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug.
p387
aa(lp388
V(Applause)
p389
aa(lp390
VDP: Wow.
p391
aa(lp392
V(Applause)
p393
aa(lp394
VI found that video very, very thought provoking,
p395
aVand that's why I wanted to bring it here for you guys to see.
p396
aVAnd what was interesting about it is the obvious choice
p397
aVfor me to talk about was graphics and audio.
p398
aVBut as you heard, Michael talked about all these other elements as well.
p399
aVVideo games give an awful lot of other things too,
p400
aVand that's why people get so addicted.
p401
aVThe most important one being fun.
p402
aa(lp403
VThe name of this track is "The Magic To Come."
p404
aVWho is that going to come from?
p405
aVIs it going to come from the best directors in the world
p406
aVas we thought it probably would?
p407
aVI don't think so.
p408
aVI think it's going to come from the children who are growing up now
p409
aVthat aren't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past.
p410
aVThey're going to do it their way, using the tools that we've created.
p411
aVThe same with students or highly creative people,
p412
aVwriters and people like that.
p413
aa(lp414
VAs far as colleges go, there's about 350 colleges around the world
p415
aVteaching video game courses.
p416
aVThat means there's literally thousands of new ideas.
p417
aVSome of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great.
p418
aVThere's nothing worse than having to listen to someone
p419
aVtry and pitch you a really bad video game idea.
p420
aa(lp421
V(Laughter)
p422
aa(lp423
VChris Anderson: You're off, you're off. That's it.
p424
aVHe's out of time.
p425
aa(lp426
VDP: I've just got a little tiny bit more if you'll indulge me.
p427
aa(lp428
VCA: Go ahead. I'm going to stay right here though.
p429
aa(lp430
V(Laughter)
p431
aa(lp432
VDP: This is just a cool shot, because this is students coming to school after class.
p433
aVThe school is closed; they're coming back at midnight
p434
aVbecause they want to pitch their video game ideas.
p435
aVI'm sitting at the front of the class,
p436
aVand they're actually pitching their ideas.
p437
aVSo it's hard to get students to come back to class,
p438
aVbut it is possible.
p439
aa(lp440
VThis is my daughter, her name's Emma, she's 17 months old.
p441
aVAnd I've been asking myself, what is Emma going to experience
p442
aVin the video game world?
p443
aVAnd as I've shown here, we have the audience.
p444
aVShe's never going to know a world where you can't press a button
p445
aVand have millions of people ready to play.
p446
aVYou know, we have the technology.
p447
aVShe's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren't
p448
aVstunning and really immersive.
p449
aVAnd as the student video showed, we can impact and move.
p450
aVShe's never going to know a world where video games
p451
aVaren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry.
p452
aVI just hope she likes video games.
