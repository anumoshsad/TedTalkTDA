VWe lost a lot of time at school learning spelling.
p4
aVKids are still losing a lot of time at school with spelling.
p5
aVThat's why I want to share a question with you:
p6
aVDo we need new spelling rules?
p7
aVI believe that yes, we do.
p8
aVOr even better, I think we need to simplify the ones we already have.
p9
aa(lp10
VNeither the question nor the answer are new in the Spanish language.
p11
aVThey have been bouncing around from century to century
p12
aVsince 1492, when in the first grammar guide of the Spanish language,
p13
aVAntonio de Nebrija, set a clear and simple principle for our spelling:
p14
aV"... thus, we have to write words as we pronounce them,
p15
aVand pronounce words as we write them."
p16
aVEach sound was to correspond to one letter,
p17
aVeach letter was to represent a single sound,
p18
aVand those which did not represent any sound should be removed.
p19
aVThis approach, the phonetic approach,
p20
aVwhich says we have to write words as we pronounce them,
p21
aVboth is and isn't at the root of spelling as we practice it today.
p22
aVIt is, because the Spanish language, in contrast to English, French or others,
p23
aValways strongly resisted writing words too differently
p24
aVto how we pronounce them.
p25
aa(lp26
VBut the phonetic approach is also absent today,
p27
aVbecause when, in the 18th century, we decided how we would standardize
p28
aVour writing,
p29
aVthere was another approach which guided a good part of the decisions.
p30
aVIt was the etymological approach,
p31
aVthe one that says we have to write words
p32
aVaccording to how they were written in their original language,
p33
aVin Latin, in Greek.
p34
aVThat's how we ended up with silent H's, which we write but don't pronounce.
p35
aVThat's how we have B's and V's that, contrary to what many people believe,
p36
aVwere never differentiated in Spanish pronunciation.
p37
aVThat's how we wound up with G's,
p38
aVthat are sometimes aspirated, as in "gente,"
p39
aVand other times unaspirated, as in "gato."
p40
aVThat's how we ended up with C's, S's and Z's,
p41
aVthree letters that in some places correspond to one sound,
p42
aVand in others, to two, but nowhere to three.
p43
aa(lp44
VI'm not here to tell you anything you don't know from your own experience.
p45
aVWe all went to school,
p46
aVwe all invested big amounts of learning time,
p47
aVbig amounts of pliant, childlike brain time
p48
aVin dictation,
p49
aVin the memorization of spelling rules filled, nevertheless, with exceptions.
p50
aVWe were told in many ways, implicitly and explicitly,
p51
aVthat in spelling, something fundamental to our upbringing was at stake.
p52
aVYet, I have the feeling
p53
aVthat teachers didn't ask themselves why it was so important.
p54
aVIn fact, they didn't ask themselves a previous question:
p55
aVWhat is the purpose of spelling?
p56
aVWhat do we need spelling for?
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd the truth is, when someone asks themselves this question,
p59
aVthe answer is much simpler and less momentous
p60
aVthan we'd usually believe.
p61
aVWe use spelling to unify the way we write, so we can all write the same way,
p62
aVmaking it easier for us to understand when we read to each other.
p63
aVBut unlike in other aspects of language such as punctuation,
p64
aVin spelling, there's no individual expression involved.
p65
aVIn punctuation, there is.
p66
aVWith punctuation, I can choose to change the meaning of a phrase.
p67
aVWith punctuation, I can impose a particular rhythm to what I am writing,
p68
aVbut not with spelling.
p69
aVWhen it comes to spelling, it's either wrong or right,
p70
aVaccording to whether it conforms or not to the current rules.
p71
aVBut then, wouldn't it be more sensible to simplify the current rules
p72
aVso it would be easier to teach, learn and use spelling correctly?
p73
aVWouldn't it be more sensible to simplify the current rules
p74
aVso that all the time we devote today to teaching spelling,
p75
aVwe could devote to other language issues
p76
aVwhose complexities do, in fact, deserve the time and effort?
p77
aa(lp78
VWhat I propose is not to abolish spelling,
p79
aVand have everyone write however they want.
p80
aVLanguage is a tool of common usage,
p81
aVand so I believe it's fundamental that we use it following common criteria.
p82
aVBut I also find it fundamental
p83
aVthat those common criteria be as simple as possible,
p84
aVespecially because if we simplify our spelling,
p85
aVwe're not leveling it down;
p86
aVwhen spelling is simplified,
p87
aVthe quality of the language doesn't suffer at all.
p88
aa(lp89
VI work every day with Spanish Golden Age literature,
p90
aVI read Garcilaso, Cervantes, Góngora, Quevedo,
p91
aVwho sometimes write "hombre" without H,
p92
aVsometimes write "escribir" with V,
p93
aVand it's absolutely clear to me
p94
aVthat the difference between those texts and ours is one of convention,
p95
aVor rather, a lack of convention during their time.
p96
aVBut it's not a difference of quality.
p97
aVBut let me go back to the masters,
p98
aVbecause they're key characters in this story.
p99
aVEarlier, I mentioned this slightly thoughtless insistence
p100
aVwith which teachers pester and pester us
p101
aVover spelling.
p102
aVBut the truth is, things being as they are,
p103
aVthis makes perfect sense.
p104
aVIn our society, spelling serves as an index of privilege,
p105
aVseparating the cultured from the brute, the educated from the ignorant,
p106
aVindependent of the content that's being written.
p107
aVOne can get or not get a job
p108
aVbecause of an H that one put or did not.
p109
aVOne can become an object of public ridicule
p110
aVbecause of a misplaced B.
p111
aVTherefore, in this context,
p112
aVof course, it makes sense to dedicate all this time to spelling.
p113
aa(lp114
VBut we shouldn't forget
p115
aVthat throughout the history of our language,
p116
aVit has always been teachers
p117
aVor people involved in the early learning of language
p118
aVwho promoted spelling reforms,
p119
aVwho realized that in our spelling there was often an obstacle
p120
aVto the transmission of knowledge.
p121
aVIn our case, for example,
p122
aVSarmiento, together with Andrés Bello, spearheaded the biggest spelling reform
p123
aVto take place in the Spanish language:
p124
aVthe mid-19th century Chilean reform.
p125
aVThen, why not take over the task of those teachers
p126
aVand start making progress in our spelling?
p127
aVHere, in this intimate group of 10,000,
p128
aVI'd like to bring to the table
p129
aVsome changes that I find reasonable to start discussing.
p130
aa(lp131
VLet's remove the silent H.
p132
aVIn places where we write an H but pronounce nothing,
p133
aVlet's not write anything.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Applause)
p136
aa(lp137
VIt's hard for me to imagine what sentimental attachment
p138
aVcan justify to someone all the hassle caused by the silent H.
p139
aVB and V, as we said before,
p140
aVwere never differentiated in the Spanish language \u2014
p141
aa(lp142
V(Applause)
p143
aa(lp144
VLet's choose one; it could be either. We can discuss it, talk it over.
p145
aVEveryone will have their preferences and can make their arguments.
p146
aVLet's keep one, remove the other.
p147
aVG and J, let's separate their roles.
p148
aVG should keep the unaspirated sound, like in "gato," "mago," and "águila,"
p149
aVand J should keep the aspirated sound,
p150
aVas in "jarabe," "jirafa," "gente," "argentino."
p151
aVThe case of C, S and Z is interesting,
p152
aVbecause it shows that the phonetic approach must be a guide,
p153
aVbut it can't be an absolute principle.
p154
aVIn some cases, the differences in pronunciation must be addressed.
p155
aVAs I said before, C, S and Z,
p156
aVin some places, correspond to one sound, in others to two.
p157
aVIf we go from three letters to two, we're all better off.
p158
aa(lp159
VTo some, these changes may seem a bit drastic.
p160
aVThey're really not.
p161
aVThe Royal Spanish Academy, all of language academies,
p162
aValso believes that spelling should be progressively modified;
p163
aVthat language is linked to history, tradition and custom,
p164
aVbut that at the same time, it is a practical everyday tool
p165
aVand that sometimes this attachment to history, tradition and custom
p166
aVbecomes an obstacle for its current usage.
p167
aVIndeed, this explains the fact
p168
aVthat our language, much more than the others we are geographically close to,
p169
aVhas been historically modifying itself based on us,
p170
aVfor example, we went from "ortographia" to "ortografía,"
p171
aVfrom "theatro" to "teatro," from "quantidad" to "cantidad,"
p172
aVfrom "symbolo" to "símbolo."
p173
aVAnd some silent H's are slowly being stealthily removed:
p174
aVin the Dictionary of the Royal Academy,
p175
aV"arpa" and "armonía" can be written with or without an H.
p176
aVAnd everybody is OK.
p177
aa(lp178
VI also believe
p179
aVthat this is a particularly appropriate moment to have this discussion.
p180
aVIt's always said that language changes spontaneously,
p181
aVfrom the bottom up,
p182
aVthat its users are the ones who incorporate new words
p183
aVand who introduce grammatical changes,
p184
aVand that the authority \u2014 in some places an academy,
p185
aVin others a dictionary, in others a ministry \u2014
p186
aVaccepts and incorporates them long after the fact.
p187
aVThis is true only for some levels of language.
p188
aVIt is true on the lexical level, the level of words.
p189
aVIt is less true on the grammatical level,
p190
aVand I would almost say it is not true for the spelling level,
p191
aVthat has historically changed from the top down.
p192
aVInstitutions have always been the ones to establish the rules
p193
aVand propose changes.
p194
aa(lp195
VWhy do I say this is a particularly appropriate moment?
p196
aVUntil today,
p197
aVwriting always had a much more restricted and private use than speech.
p198
aVBut in our time, the age of social networks,
p199
aVthis is going through a revolutionary change.
p200
aVNever before have people written so much;
p201
aVnever before have people written for so many others to see.
p202
aVAnd in these social networks, for the first time,
p203
aVwe're seeing innovative uses of spelling on a large scale,
p204
aVwhere even more-than-educated people with impeccable spelling,
p205
aVwhen using social networks,
p206
aVbehave a lot like the majority of users of social networks behave.
p207
aVThat is to say, they slack on spell-checking
p208
aVand prioritize speed and efficacy in communication.
p209
aVFor now, on social networks, we see chaotic, individual usages.
p210
aVBut I think we have to pay attention to them,
p211
aVbecause they're probably telling us
p212
aVthat an era that designates a new place for writing
p213
aVseeks new criteria for that writing.
p214
aVI think we'd be wrong to reject them, to discard them,
p215
aVbecause we identify them as symptoms of the cultural decay of our times.
p216
aVNo, I believe we have to observe them, organize them and channel them
p217
aVwithin guidelines that better correspond to the needs of our times.
p218
aa(lp219
VI can anticipate some objections.
p220
aVThere will be those who'll say
p221
aVthat if we simplify spelling we'll lose etymology.
p222
aVStrictly speaking, if we wanted to preserve etymology,
p223
aVit would go beyond just spelling.
p224
aVWe'd also have to learn Latin, Greek, Arabic.
p225
aVWith simplified spelling,
p226
aVwe would normalize etymology in the same place we do now:
p227
aVin etymological dictionaries.
p228
aVA second objection will come from those who say:
p229
aV"If we simplify spelling, we'll stop distinguishing
p230
aVbetween words that differ in just one letter."
p231
aVThat is true, but it's not a problem.
p232
aVOur language has homonyms, words with more than one meaning,
p233
aVyet we don't confuse the "banco" where we sit
p234
aVwith the "banco" where we deposit money,
p235
aVor the "traje" that we wear with the things we "trajimos."
p236
aVIn the vast majority of situations, context dispels any confusion.
p237
aa(lp238
VBut there's a third objection.
p239
aVTo me,
p240
aVit's the most understandable, even the most moving.
p241
aVIt's the people who'll say: "I don't want to change.
p242
aVI was brought up like this, I got used to doing it this way,
p243
aVwhen I read a written word in simplified spelling, my eyes hurt."
p244
aa(lp245
V(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
VThis objection is, in part, in all of us.
p248
aVWhat do I think we should do?
p249
aVThe same thing that's always done in these cases:
p250
aVchanges are made looking forward; children are taught the new rules,
p251
aVthose of us who don't want to adapt can write the way we're used to writing,
p252
aVand hopefully, time will cement the new rules in place.
p253
aVThe success of every spelling reform that affects deeply rooted habits
p254
aVlies in caution, agreement, gradualism and tolerance.
p255
aVAt the same time, can't allow the attachment to old customs
p256
aVimpede us from moving forward.
p257
aVThe best tribute we can pay to the past
p258
aVis to improve upon what it's given us.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo I believe that we must reach an agreement,
p261
aVthat academies must reach an agreement,
p262
aVand purge from our spelling rules
p263
aVall the habits we practice just for the sake of tradition,
p264
aVeven if they are useless now.
p265
aVI'm convinced that if we do that
p266
aVin the humble but extremely important realm of language,
p267
aVwe'll be leaving a better future to the next generations.
