VThe two most likely largest inventions
p4
aVof our generation
p5
aVare the Internet and the mobile phone.
p6
aVThey've changed the world.
p7
aVHowever, largely to our surprise,
p8
aVthey also turned out to be the perfect tools
p9
aVfor the surveillance state.
p10
aVIt turned out that the capability
p11
aVto collect data, information and connections
p12
aVabout basically any of us and all of us
p13
aVis exactly what we've been hearing
p14
aVthroughout of the summer through revelations and leaks
p15
aVabout Western intelligence agencies,
p16
aVmostly U.S. intelligence agencies,
p17
aVwatching over the rest of the world.
p18
aa(lp19
VWe've heard about these starting with the
p20
aVrevelations from June 6.
p21
aVEdward Snowden started leaking information,
p22
aVtop secret classified information,
p23
aVfrom the U.S. intelligence agencies,
p24
aVand we started learning about things like PRISM
p25
aVand XKeyscore and others.
p26
aVAnd these are examples of the kinds of programs
p27
aVU.S. intelligence agencies are running right now,
p28
aVagainst the whole rest of the world.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd if you look back about the forecasts
p31
aVon surveillance by George Orwell,
p32
aVwell it turns out that
p33
aVGeorge Orwell was an optimist.
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aVWe are right now seeing a much larger scale
p36
aVof tracking of individual citizens
p37
aVthan he could have ever imagined.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd this here is the infamous
p40
aVNSA data center in Utah.
p41
aVDue to be opened very soon,
p42
aVit will be both a supercomputing center
p43
aVand a data storage center.
p44
aVYou could basically imagine it has a large hall
p45
aVfilled with hard drives storing data
p46
aVthey are collecting.
p47
aVAnd it's a pretty big building.
p48
aVHow big? Well, I can give you the numbers \u2014
p49
aV140,000 square meters \u2014
p50
aVbut that doesn't really tell you very much.
p51
aVMaybe it's better to imagine it as a comparison.
p52
aVYou think about the largest IKEA store
p53
aVyou've ever been in.
p54
aVThis is five times larger.
p55
aVHow many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store?
p56
aVRight? It's pretty big.
p57
aVWe estimate that just the electricity bill
p58
aVfor running this data center
p59
aVis going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year.
p60
aVAnd this kind of wholesale surveillance
p61
aVmeans that they can collect our data
p62
aVand keep it basically forever,
p63
aVkeep it for extended periods of time,
p64
aVkeep it for years, keep it for decades.
p65
aVAnd this opens up completely new kinds of risks
p66
aVto us all.
p67
aVAnd what this is is that it is wholesale
p68
aVblanket surveillance on everyone.
p69
aa(lp70
VWell, not exactly everyone,
p71
aVbecause the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right
p72
aVto monitor foreigners.
p73
aVThey can monitor foreigners
p74
aVwhen foreigners' data connections
p75
aVend up in the United States or pass through the United States.
p76
aVAnd monitoring foreigners doesn't sound too bad
p77
aVuntil you realize
p78
aVthat I'm a foreigner and you're a foreigner.
p79
aVIn fact, 96 percent of the planet are foreigners.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VRight?
p84
aa(lp85
VSo it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us,
p86
aVall of us who use telecommunications and the Internet.
p87
aa(lp88
VBut don't get me wrong:
p89
aVThere are actually types of surveillance that are okay.
p90
aVI love freedom, but even I agree
p91
aVthat some surveillance is fine.
p92
aVIf the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer,
p93
aVor they're trying to catch a drug lord
p94
aVor trying to prevent a school shooting,
p95
aVand they have leads and they have suspects,
p96
aVthen it's perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect's phone,
p97
aVand to intercept his Internet communications.
p98
aVI'm not arguing that at all,
p99
aVbut that's not what programs like PRISM are about.
p100
aVThey are not about doing surveillance on people
p101
aVthat they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings.
p102
aVThey're about doing surveillance on people
p103
aVthey know are innocent.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo the four main arguments
p106
aVsupporting surveillance like this,
p107
aVwell, the first of all is that whenever you start
p108
aVdiscussing about these revelations,
p109
aVthere will be naysayers trying to minimize
p110
aVthe importance of these revelations, saying that
p111
aVwe knew all this already,
p112
aVwe knew it was happening, there's nothing new here.
p113
aVAnd that's not true. Don't let anybody tell you
p114
aVthat we knew this already, because we did not know this already.
p115
aVOur worst fears might have been something like this,
p116
aVbut we didn't know this was happening.
p117
aVNow we know for a fact it's happening.
p118
aVWe didn't know about this. We didn't know about PRISM.
p119
aVWe didn't know about XKeyscore. We didn't know about Cybertrans.
p120
aVWe didn't know about DoubleArrow.
p121
aVWe did not know about Skywriter \u2014
p122
aVall these different programs
p123
aVrun by U.S. intelligence agencies.
p124
aVBut now we do.
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd we did not know
p127
aVthat U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes
p128
aVsuch as infiltrating standardization bodies
p129
aVto sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose.
p130
aVAnd what that means
p131
aVis that you take something which is secure,
p132
aVan encryption algorithm which is so secure
p133
aVthat if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file,
p134
aVnobody can decrypt that file.
p135
aVEven if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file,
p136
aVit's going to take millions of years.
p137
aVSo that's basically perfectly safe, uncrackable.
p138
aVYou take something which is that good
p139
aVand then you weaken it on purpose,
p140
aVmaking all of us less secure as an end result.
p141
aVA real-world equivalent would be that
p142
aVintelligence agencies would force
p143
aVsome secret pin code into every single house alarm
p144
aVso they could get into every single house
p145
aVbecause, you know, bad people might have house alarms,
p146
aVbut it will also make all of us
p147
aVless secure as an end result.
p148
aVBackdooring encryption algorithms
p149
aVjust boggles the mind.
p150
aVBut of course, these intelligence agencies are doing their job.
p151
aVThis is what they have been told to do:
p152
aVdo signals intelligence,
p153
aVmonitor telecommunications,
p154
aVmonitor Internet traffic.
p155
aVThat's what they're trying to do,
p156
aVand since most, a very big part of the Internet traffic today is encrypted,
p157
aVthey're trying to find ways around the encryption.
p158
aVOne way is to sabotage encryption algorithms,
p159
aVwhich is a great example
p160
aVabout how U.S. intelligence agencies
p161
aVare running loose.
p162
aVThey are completely out of control,
p163
aVand they should be brought back under control.
p164
aa(lp165
VSo what do we actually know about the leaks?
p166
aVEverything is based on the files
p167
aVleaked by Mr. Snowden.
p168
aVThe very first PRISM slides
p169
aVfrom the beginning of June
p170
aVdetail a collection program where the data
p171
aVis collected from service providers,
p172
aVand they actually go and name the service providers
p173
aVthey have access to.
p174
aVThey even have a specific date
p175
aVon when the collection of data began
p176
aVfor each of the service providers.
p177
aVSo for example, they name the collection from Microsoft
p178
aVstarted on September 11, 2007,
p179
aVfor Yahoo on the March 12, 2008,
p180
aVand then others: Google, Facebook,
p181
aVSkype, Apple and so on.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd every single one of these companies denies.
p184
aVThey all say that this simply isn't true,
p185
aVthat they are not giving backdoor access to their data.
p186
aVYet we have these files.
p187
aVSo is one of the parties lying,
p188
aVor is there some other alternative explanation?
p189
aVAnd one explanation would be
p190
aVthat these parties, these service providers,
p191
aVare not cooperating.
p192
aVInstead, they've been hacked.
p193
aVThat would explain it. They aren't cooperating. They've been hacked.
p194
aVIn this case, they've been hacked by their own government.
p195
aVThat might sound outlandish,
p196
aVbut we already have cases where this has happened,
p197
aVfor example, the case of the Flame malware
p198
aVwhich we strongly believe was authored
p199
aVby the U.S. government,
p200
aVand which, to spread, subverted the security
p201
aVof the Windows Update network,
p202
aVmeaning here, the company was hacked
p203
aVby their own government.
p204
aVAnd there's more evidence
p205
aVsupporting this theory as well.
p206
aVDer Spiegel, from Germany, leaked more information
p207
aVabout the operations run by the elite hacker units
p208
aVoperating inside these intelligence agencies.
p209
aVInside NSA, the unit is called TAO,
p210
aVTailored Access Operations,
p211
aVand inside GCHQ, which is the U.K. equivalent,
p212
aVit's called NAC, Network Analysis Centre.
p213
aVAnd these recent leaks of these three slides
p214
aVdetail an operation
p215
aVrun by this GCHQ intelligence agency
p216
aVfrom the United Kingdom
p217
aVtargeting a telecom here in Belgium.
p218
aVAnd what this really means
p219
aVis that an E.U. country's intelligence agency
p220
aVis breaching the security
p221
aVof a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose,
p222
aVand they discuss it in their slides completely casually,
p223
aVbusiness as usual.
p224
aVHere's the primary target,
p225
aVhere's the secondary target,
p226
aVhere's the teaming.
p227
aVThey probably have a team building on Thursday evening in a pub.
p228
aVThey even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art
p229
aVlike, you know, "Success,"
p230
aVwhen they gain access to services like this.
p231
aVWhat the hell?
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd then there's the argument
p234
aVthat okay, yes, this might be going on,
p235
aVbut then again, other countries are doing it as well.
p236
aVAll countries spy.
p237
aVAnd maybe that's true.
p238
aVMany countries spy, not all of them, but let's take an example.
p239
aVLet's take, for example, Sweden.
p240
aVI'm speaking of Sweden because Sweden
p241
aVhas a little bit of a similar law to the United States.
p242
aVWhen your data traffic goes through Sweden,
p243
aVtheir intelligence agency has a legal right by the law
p244
aVto intercept that traffic.
p245
aVAll right, how many Swedish decisionmakers
p246
aVand politicians and business leaders
p247
aVuse, every day, U.S.-based services,
p248
aVlike, you know, run Windows or OSX,
p249
aVor use Facebook or LinkedIn,
p250
aVor store their data in clouds like iCloud
p251
aVor Skydrive or DropBox,
p252
aVor maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support?
p253
aVAnd the answer is, every single Swedish business leader does that every single day.
p254
aVAnd then we turn it around.
p255
aVHow many American leaders
p256
aVuse Swedish webmails and cloud services?
p257
aVAnd the answer is zero.
p258
aVSo this is not balanced.
p259
aVIt's not balanced by any means, not even close.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd when we do have the occasional
p262
aVEuropean success story,
p263
aVeven those, then, typically end up being sold to the United States.
p264
aVLike, Skype used to be secure.
p265
aVIt used to be end-to-end encrypted.
p266
aVThen it was sold to the United States.
p267
aVToday, it no longer is secure.
p268
aVSo once again, we take something which is secure
p269
aVand then we make it less secure on purpose,
p270
aVmaking all of us less secure as an outcome.
p271
aa(lp272
VAnd then the argument that the United States
p273
aVis only fighting terrorists.
p274
aVIt's the war on terror.
p275
aVYou shouldn't worry about it.
p276
aVWell, it's not the war on terror.
p277
aVYes, part of it is war on terror, and yes,
p278
aVthere are terrorists, and they do kill and maim,
p279
aVand we should fight them,
p280
aVbut we know through these leaks
p281
aVthat they have used the same techniques
p282
aVto listen to phone calls of European leaders,
p283
aVto tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil,
p284
aVto read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament,
p285
aVand I don't think they are trying to find terrorists
p286
aVfrom inside the E.U. Parliament, right?
p287
aVIt's not the war on terror.
p288
aVPart of it might be, and there are terrorists,
p289
aVbut are we really thinking about terrorists
p290
aVas such an existential threat
p291
aVthat we are willing to do anything at all to fight them?
p292
aVAre the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion
p293
aVand throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists?
p294
aVAnd the same thing with the Bill of Rights and all the amendments
p295
aVand the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
p296
aVand the E.U. conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms
p297
aVand the press freedom?
p298
aVDo we really think terrorism is such an existential threat,
p299
aVwe are ready to do anything at all?
p300
aa(lp301
VBut people are scared about terrorists,
p302
aVand then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay
p303
aVbecause they have nothing to hide.
p304
aVFeel free to survey me if that helps.
p305
aVAnd whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide
p306
aVsimply hasn't thought about this long enough.
p307
aa(lp308
V(Applause)
p309
aa(lp310
VBecause we have this thing called privacy,
p311
aVand if you really think that you have nothing to hide,
p312
aVplease make sure that's the first thing you tell me,
p313
aVbecause then I know
p314
aVthat I should not trust you with any secrets,
p315
aVbecause obviously you can't keep a secret.
p316
aVBut people are brutally honest with the Internet,
p317
aVand when these leaks started,
p318
aVmany people were asking me about this.
p319
aVAnd I have nothing to hide.
p320
aVI'm not doing anything bad or anything illegal.
p321
aVYet, I have nothing that I would in particular
p322
aVlike to share with an intelligence agency,
p323
aVespecially a foreign intelligence agency.
p324
aVAnd if we indeed need a Big Brother,
p325
aVI would much rather have a domestic Big Brother
p326
aVthan a foreign Big Brother.
p327
aVAnd when the leaks started, the very first thing I tweeted about this
p328
aVwas a comment about how,
p329
aVwhen you've been using search engines,
p330
aVyou've been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence.
p331
aVAnd two minutes later, I got a reply
p332
aVby somebody called Kimberly from the United States
p333
aVchallenging me, like, why am I worried about this?
p334
aVWhat am I sending to worry about this? Am I sending naked pictures or something?
p335
aVAnd my answer to Kimberly was
p336
aVthat what I'm sending is none of your business,
p337
aVand it should be none of your government's business either.
p338
aVBecause that's what it's about. It's about privacy.
p339
aVPrivacy is nonnegotiable.
p340
aVIt should be built in to all the systems we use.
p341
aa(lp342
V(Applause)
p343
aa(lp344
VAnd one thing we should all understand
p345
aVis that we are brutally honest with search engines.
p346
aVYou show me your search history,
p347
aVand I'll find something incriminating
p348
aVor something embarrassing there in five minutes.
p349
aVWe are more honest with search engines
p350
aVthan we are with our families.
p351
aVSearch engines know more about you
p352
aVthan your family members know about you.
p353
aVAnd this is all the kind of information we are giving away,
p354
aVwe are giving away to the United States.
p355
aa(lp356
VAnd surveillance changes history.
p357
aVWe know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon.
p358
aVImagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today.
p359
aVAnd let me actually quote
p360
aVthe president of Brazil, Ms. Dilma Rousseff.
p361
aVShe was one of the targets of NSA surveillance.
p362
aVHer email was read, and she spoke
p363
aVat the United Nations Headquarters, and she said,
p364
aV"If there is no right to privacy,
p365
aVthere can be no true freedom of expression and opinion,
p366
aVand therefore, there can be no effective democracy."
p367
aa(lp368
VThat's what it's about.
p369
aVPrivacy is the building block of our democracies.
p370
aVAnd to quote a fellow security researcher, Marcus Ranum,
p371
aVhe said that the United States is right now treating the Internet
p372
aVas it would be treating one of its colonies.
p373
aVSo we are back to the age of colonization,
p374
aVand we, the foreign users of the Internet,
p375
aVwe should think about Americans as our masters.
p376
aa(lp377
VSo Mr. Snowden, he's been blamed for many things.
p378
aVSome are blaming him for causing problems
p379
aVfor the U.S. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations \u2014
p380
aVand blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry
p381
aVwould be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore
p382
aVfor causing global warming.
p383
aa(lp384
V(Laughter)
p385
aa(lp386
V(Applause)
p387
aa(lp388
VSo, what is there to be done?
p389
aVShould we worry. No, we shouldn't worry.
p390
aVWe should be angry, because this is wrong,
p391
aVand it's rude, and it should not be done.
p392
aVBut that's not going to really change the situation.
p393
aVWhat's going to change the situation for the rest of the world
p394
aVis to try to steer away
p395
aVfrom systems built in the United States.
p396
aVAnd that's much easier said than done.
p397
aVHow do you do that?
p398
aVA single country, any single country in Europe
p399
aVcannot replace and build replacements
p400
aVfor the U.S.-made operating systems and cloud services.
p401
aa(lp402
VBut maybe you don't have to do it alone.
p403
aVMaybe you can do it together with other countries.
p404
aVThe solution is open source.
p405
aVBy building together open, free, secure systems,
p406
aVwe can go around such surveillance,
p407
aVand then one country doesn't have to solve the problem by itself.
p408
aVIt only has to solve one little problem.
p409
aVAnd to quote a fellow security researcher, Haroon Meer,
p410
aVone country only has to make a small wave,
p411
aVbut those small waves together become a tide,
p412
aVand the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time,
p413
aVand the tide we will build
p414
aVwith secure, free, open-source systems,
p415
aVwill become the tide that will lift all of us
p416
aVup and above the surveillance state.
p417
