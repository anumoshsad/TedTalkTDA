VI just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal.
p4
aVAnd I come from a long way.
p5
aVI've been telling a story that has been so painful for me.
p6
aVIt's been a tough journey for me, traveling the world,
p7
aVtelling my story in form of a book.
p8
aVAnd also telling it like now.
p9
aVAnd also, the easiest one was
p10
aVwhen I was doing it in form of a music.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo I have branded myself as a war child.
p13
aVI'm doing this
p14
aVbecause of an old lady in my village now,
p15
aVwho have lost her children.
p16
aVThere is no newspaper to cover her pain,
p17
aVand what she wants to change in this society.
p18
aVAnd I'm doing it for a young man
p19
aVwho want to create a change and has no way to project his voice
p20
aVbecause he can't write.
p21
aVOr there is no Internet, like Facebook, MySpace,
p22
aVYouTube, for them to talk.
p23
aa(lp24
VAlso one thing that kept me pushing this story,
p25
aVthis painful stories out, the dreams I have,
p26
aVsometimes, is like the voices of the dead,
p27
aVthat I have seen
p28
aVwould tell me, "Don't give up. Keep on going."
p29
aVBecause sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it,
p30
aVbecause I didn't know what I was putting myself into.
p31
aa(lp32
VWell I was born in the most difficult time,
p33
aVwhen my country was at war.
p34
aVI saw my village burned down.
p35
aVThe world that meant a lot to me, I saw it
p36
aVvanish in my face.
p37
aVI saw my aunt in rape when I was only five.
p38
aVMy mother was claimed by the war.
p39
aVMy brothers and sisters were scattered.
p40
aVAnd up to now, me and my father
p41
aVwere detached and I still have issues with him.
p42
aVSeeing people die every day,
p43
aVmy mother crying,
p44
aVit's like I was raised in a violence.
p45
aVAnd that made me call myself a war child.
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd not only that, when I was eight
p48
aVI became a child soldier.
p49
aa(lp50
VI didn't know what was the war for.
p51
aVBut one thing I knew
p52
aVwas an image that I saw that stuck in my head.
p53
aVWhen I went to the training camp I say,
p54
aV"I want to kill as many Muslims,
p55
aVand as many Arabs, as possible."
p56
aVThe training wasn't easy, but that was the driving force,
p57
aVbecause I wanted to revenge for my family.
p58
aVI wanted to revenge for my village.
p59
aa(lp60
VLuckily now things have changed
p61
aVbecause I came to discover the truth.
p62
aVWhat was actually killing us wasn't the Muslims,
p63
aVwasn't the Arabs.
p64
aVIt was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system,
p65
aVand using religion to get what they want to get out of us,
p66
aVwhich is the oil, the diamond,
p67
aVthe gold and the land.
p68
aVSo realizing the truth gave me a position to choose:
p69
aVshould I continue to hate, or let it go?
p70
aa(lp71
VSo I happened to forgive. Now I sing
p72
aVmusic with the Muslims. I dance with them.
p73
aVI even had a movie out called "War Child,"
p74
aVfunded by Muslim people.
p75
aVSo that pain has gone out.
p76
aVBut my story is huge.
p77
aVSo I'm just going to go into a different step now,
p78
aVwhich is easier for me.
p79
aVI'm going to give you poem
p80
aVcalled "Forced to Sin,"
p81
aVwhich is from my album "War Child."
p82
aVI talk about my story.
p83
aVOne of the journey that I tread
p84
aVwhen I was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food
p85
aVand we were like around 400.
p86
aVAnd only 16 people survived that journey.
p87
aVSo I hope you're going to hear this.
p88
aa(lp89
VMy dreams are like torment.
p90
aVMy every moment.
p91
aa(lp92
VVoices in my brain, of friends that was slain.
p93
aa(lp94
VFriends like Lual who died by my side,
p95
aa(lp96
Vof starvation.
p97
aVIn the burning jungle, and the desert plain.
p98
aa(lp99
VNext was I, but Jesus heard my cry.
p100
aa(lp101
VAs I was tempted to eat the rotten flesh
p102
aVof my comrade,
p103
aa(lp104
Vhe gave me comfort.
p105
aa(lp106
VWe used to raid villages,
p107
aVstealing chickens, goats and sheeps,
p108
aa(lp109
Vanything we could eat.
p110
aa(lp111
VI knew it was rude, but we needed food.
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd therefore I was forced to sin,
p114
aVforced to sin to make a living,
p115
aa(lp116
Vforced to sin to make a living.
p117
aa(lp118
VSometimes you gotta lose to win.
p119
aa(lp120
VNever give up. Never give in.
p121
aa(lp122
VLeft home at the age of seven.
p123
aa(lp124
VOne year later, live with an AK-47 by my side.
p125
aa(lp126
VSlept with one eye open wide.
p127
aa(lp128
VRun, duck, play dead and hide.
p129
aa(lp130
VI've seen my people die like flies.
p131
aa(lp132
VBut I've never seen a dead body,
p133
aa(lp134
Vat least one that I've killed.
p135
aa(lp136
VBut still as I wonder, I won't go under.
p137
aa(lp138
VGuns barking like lightning and thunder.
p139
aa(lp140
VAs a child so young and tender,
p141
aa(lp142
VWords I can't forget I still remember.
p143
aa(lp144
VI saw sergeant command raising his hand,
p145
aa(lp146
Vno retreat, no surrender.
p147
aa(lp148
VI carry the banner of the trauma.
p149
aa(lp150
VWar child, child without a mama,
p151
aa(lp152
Vstill fighting in the saga.
p153
aa(lp154
VYet as I wage this new war I'm not alone in this drama.
p155
aa(lp156
VNo sit or stop, as I reach for the top
p157
aa(lp158
VI'm fully dedicated like a patriotic cop.
p159
aa(lp160
VI'm on a fight, day and night.
p161
aa(lp162
VSometime I do wrong in order to make things right.
p163
aa(lp164
VIt's like I'm living a dream.
p165
aa(lp166
VFirst time I'm feeling like a human being.
p167
aa(lp168
VAh! The children of Darfur.
p169
aa(lp170
VYour empty bellies on the telly and now it's you
p171
aVthat I'm fighting for.
p172
aa(lp173
VLeft home.
p174
aVDon't even know the day I'll ever return.
p175
aa(lp176
VMy country is war-torn.
p177
aa(lp178
VMusic I used to hear was bombs and fire of guns.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo many people die that I don't even cry no more.
p181
aa(lp182
VAsk God question, what am I here for.
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd why are my people poor.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd why, why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write,
p187
aa(lp188
VI was learning how to fight.
p189
aa(lp190
VI ate snails, vultures, rabbits,
p191
aVsnakes, and anything that had life.
p192
aa(lp193
VI was ready to eat.
p194
aa(lp195
VI know it's a shame. But who is to be blamed?
p196
aa(lp197
VThat's my story shared in the form of a lesson.
p198
aa(lp199
V(Applause)
p200
aVThank you.
p201
aV(Applause)
p202
aa(lp203
VWhat energized me and kept me going is the music I do.
p204
aVI never saw anybody
p205
aVto tell my story to them
p206
aVso they could advise me or do therapy.
p207
aVSo the music had been my therapy for me.
p208
aVIt's been where I actually see heaven,
p209
aVwhere I can be happy,
p210
aVwhere I can be a child again, in dances, through music.
p211
aVSo one thing I know about music:
p212
aVmusic is the only thing that has power
p213
aVto enter your cell system,
p214
aVyour mind, your heart,
p215
aVinfluence your soul and your spirit,
p216
aVand can even influence the way you live
p217
aVwithout even you knowing.
p218
aVMusic is the only thing that can
p219
aVmake you want to wake up your bed
p220
aVand shake your leg,
p221
aVwithout even wanting to do it.
p222
aVAnd so the power music has
p223
aVI normally compare to the power love
p224
aVwhen love doesn't see a color.
p225
aVYou know, if you fall in love with a frog, that's it.
p226
aa(lp227
VOne testimony about how I find music
p228
aVis powerful is when
p229
aVI was still a soldier back then.
p230
aVI hated the people in the north.
p231
aVBut I don't know why I don't hate their music.
p232
aVSo we party and dance to their music.
p233
aVAnd one thing that shocked me is one day
p234
aVthey brought an Arab musician
p235
aVto come and entertain the soldiers.
p236
aVAnd I almost broke my leg dancing to his music.
p237
aVBut I had this question.
p238
aVSo now I'm doing music so I know what the power of music is.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo what's happening here?
p241
aVI've been in a painful journey.
p242
aVToday is day number 233
p243
aVin which I only eat dinner.
p244
aVI don't eat breakfast. No lunch.
p245
aVAnd I've done a campaign called
p246
aVLose to Win.
p247
aVWhere I'm losing so that I could win
p248
aVthe battle that I'm fighting now.
p249
aVSo my breakfast, my lunch,
p250
aVI donate it to a charity that I founded
p251
aVbecause we want to build a school in Sudan.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd I'm doing this because also
p254
aVit's a normal thing in my home, people eat one meal a day.
p255
aVHere I am in the West. I choose not to.
p256
aVSo in my village now, kids there,
p257
aVthey normally listen to BBC, or any radio,
p258
aVand they are waiting to know,
p259
aVthe day Emmanuel will eat his breakfast
p260
aVit means he got the money to build our school.
p261
aVAnd so I made a commitment. I say,
p262
aV"I'm gonna not eat my breakfast."
p263
aVI thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month,
p264
aVbut I've been humbled.
p265
aV(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
VSo it's taken me 232 days.
p268
aVAnd I said, "No stop until we get it."
p269
aVAnd like it's been done on Facebook, MySpace.
p270
aVThe people are giving three dollars.
p271
aVThe lowest amount we ever got was 20 cents.
p272
aVSomebody donated 20 cents online.
p273
aVI don't know how they did it.
p274
aV(Laughter)
p275
aVBut that moved me.
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd so, the importance of education to me
p278
aVis what I'm willing to die for.
p279
aVI'm willing to die for this,
p280
aVbecause I know what it can do to my people.
p281
aVEducation enlighten your brain,
p282
aVgive you so many chances,
p283
aVand you're able to survive.
p284
aVAs a nation we have been crippled.
p285
aVFor so many years we have fed on aid.
p286
aVYou see a 20-years-old, 30-years-old
p287
aVfamilies in a refugee camps.
p288
aVThey only get the food that drops from the sky, from the U.N.
p289
aa(lp290
VSo these people,
p291
aVyou're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid.
p292
aVIf anybody want to help us
p293
aVthis is what we need.
p294
aVGive us tools. Give the farmers tools.
p295
aVIt's rain. Africa is fertile. They can grow the crops.
p296
aV(Applause)
p297
aVInvest in education.
p298
aVEducation so that we have strong institution
p299
aVthat can create a revolution to change everything.
p300
aVBecause we have all those old men
p301
aVthat are creating wars in Africa. They will die soon.
p302
aVBut if you invest in education
p303
aVthen we'll be able to change Africa.
p304
aVThat's what I'm asking.
p305
aV(Applause)
p306
aa(lp307
VSo in order to do that,
p308
aVI founded a charter called Gua Africa,
p309
aVwhere we put kids in school.
p310
aVAnd now we have a couple in university.
p311
aVWe have like 40 kids, ex-child soldiers
p312
aVmixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support.
p313
aVAnd I said "I'm going to put it in practice."
p314
aVAnd with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things.
p315
aVThat's what I want to do to change,
p316
aVto make a difference in the world.
p317
aa(lp318
VWell now, my time is going,
p319
aVso I want to sing a song.
p320
aVBut I'll ask you guys to stand up
p321
aVso we celebrate the life of a British aid worker
p322
aVcalled Emma McCune
p323
aVthat made it possible for me to be here.
p324
aVI'm gonna sing this song,
p325
aVjust to inspire you how this woman has made a difference.
p326
aVShe came to my country and saw the importance
p327
aVof education.
p328
aa(lp329
VShe said the only way to help Sudan
p330
aVis to invest in the women, educating them,
p331
aVeducating the children,
p332
aVso that they could come and create a revolution
p333
aVin this complex society.
p334
aVSo she even ended up marrying a commander
p335
aVfrom the SPLA.
p336
aVAnd she rescued over 150 child soldiers.
p337
aVOne of them happened to be me now.
p338
aVAnd so at this moment I want to ask to celebrate Emma with me.
p339
aVAre you guys ready to celebrate Emma?
p340
aa(lp341
VAudience: Yes!
p342
aa(lp343
VEmmanuel Jal: All right.
p344
aa(lp345
V\u266b This one goes to Emma McCune \u266b
p346
aa(lp347
V\u266b Angel to rescue came one afternoon \u266b
p348
aa(lp349
V\u266b I'm here because you rescued me \u266b
p350
aa(lp351
V\u266b I'm proud to carry your legacy \u266b
p352
aa(lp353
V\u266b Thank you. Bless you. R.I.P. \u266b
p354
aa(lp355
V\u266b What would I be? Me! \u266b
p356
aa(lp357
V\u266b If Emma never rescued me? What would I be? \u266b
p358
aa(lp359
V\u266b What would I be? Me! \u266b
p360
aV\u266b Another starving refugee \u266b
p361
aV\u266b What would I be? \u266b
p362
aa(lp363
V\u266b What would I be? Me! \u266b
p364
aa(lp365
V\u266b If Emma never rescued me? Yeah! \u266b
p366
aa(lp367
V\u266b Yeah! Yeah! \u266b
p368
aa(lp369
V\u266b You would have seen my face on the telly \u266b
p370
aa(lp371
V\u266b Fat hungry belly \u266b
p372
aa(lp373
V\u266b Flies in my eyes, head too big for my size \u266b
p374
aa(lp375
V\u266b Just another little starving child \u266b
p376
aa(lp377
V\u266b Running around in Africa, born to be wild \u266b
p378
aa(lp379
V\u266b Praise God, praise the Almighty \u266b
p380
aa(lp381
V\u266b for sending an angel to rescue me \u266b
p382
aa(lp383
V\u266b I got a reason for being on this Earth \u266b
p384
aa(lp385
V\u266b 'Cause I know more than many what a life is worth \u266b
p386
aa(lp387
V\u266b Now that I got a chance to stand my ground \u266b
p388
aa(lp389
V\u266b I'm gonna run over mountains, leaps and bounds \u266b
p390
aa(lp391
V\u266b I ain't an angel, hope I'll be one soon \u266b
p392
aa(lp393
V\u266b And if I am, I wanna be like Emma McCune \u266b
p394
aa(lp395
V\u266b Me! What would I be? Me! \u266b
p396
aa(lp397
V\u266b If Emma never rescued me? \u266b
p398
aa(lp399
V\u266b What would I be? \u266b
p400
aa(lp401
V\u266b What would I be? Me! \u266b
p402
aa(lp403
V\u266b Another starving refugee \u266b
p404
aa(lp405
V\u266b What would I be? \u266b
p406
aa(lp407
V\u266b What would I be? Me! \u266b
p408
aa(lp409
V\u266b If Emma never rescued me? Yeah! Yeah!\u266b
p410
aa(lp411
V\u266b Yeah, Yeah! \u266b
p412
aa(lp413
V\u266b I would have probably died from starvation \u266b
p414
aa(lp415
V\u266b Or some other wretched disease \u266b
p416
aa(lp417
V\u266b I would have grown up with no education \u266b
p418
aa(lp419
V\u266b Just another refugee \u266b
p420
aa(lp421
V\u266b I stand here because somebody cared \u266b
p422
aa(lp423
V\u266b I stand here because somebody dared \u266b
p424
aa(lp425
V\u266b I know there is a lot of Emmas out there \u266b
p426
aa(lp427
V\u266b Who is willing and trying to save a life of a child \u266b
p428
aa(lp429
V\u266b What would I be? Me! \u266b
p430
aV\u266b If Emma never rescued me? \u266b
p431
aa(lp432
V\u266b What would I be? \u266b
p433
aV\u266b What would I be? \u266b
p434
aa(lp435
V\u266b Another starving refugee \u266b
p436
aa(lp437
V\u266b I remember the time when I was small \u266b
p438
aa(lp439
V\u266b When I couldn't read or write at all \u266b
p440
aa(lp441
V\u266b Now I'm all grown up, I got my education \u266b
p442
aa(lp443
V\u266b The sky is the limit and I can't be stopped by no one \u266b
p444
aa(lp445
V\u266b How I prayed for this day to come \u266b
p446
aa(lp447
V\u266b And I pray that the world find wisdom \u266b
p448
aa(lp449
V\u266b To give the poor in need some assistance \u266b
p450
aa(lp451
V\u266b Instead of putting up resistance, yeah \u266b
p452
aa(lp453
V\u266b Sitting and waiting for the politics to fix this \u266b
p454
aa(lp455
V\u266b It ain't gonna happen \u266b
p456
aa(lp457
V\u266b They're all sitting on they asses \u266b
p458
aa(lp459
V\u266b Popping champagne and sponging off the masses \u266b
p460
aa(lp461
V\u266b Coming from a refugee boy-soldier \u266b
p462
aa(lp463
V\u266b But I still got my dignity \u266b
p464
aa(lp465
V\u266b I gotta say it again \u266b
p466
aa(lp467
V\u266b If Emma never rescued me \u266b
p468
aa(lp469
V\u266b I'd be a corpse on the African plain \u266b
p470
aa(lp471
VIs there anybody who's here in the back, some love.
p472
aa(lp473
VBig scream for Emma everybody.
p474
aa(lp475
VYeah! I'm gonna get crazy now.
p476
aa(lp477
V\u266b What would I be? \u266b
p478
aa(lp479
V\u266b If Emma never rescued me? \u266b
p480
aa(lp481
V\u266b What would I be? \u266b
p482
aa(lp483
V\u266b Another starving refugee \u266b
p484
aa(lp485
V\u266b What would I be? \u266b
p486
aa(lp487
V\u266b If Emma never rescued me? \u266b
p488
aa(lp489
V\u266b Yeah, Yeah \u266b
p490
aa(lp491
V\u266b Yeah, I would have probably died from starvation \u266b
p492
