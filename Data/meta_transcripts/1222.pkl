VMy name is Kate Hartman.
p4
aVAnd I like to make devices
p5
aVthat play with the ways
p6
aVthat we relate and communicate.
p7
aVSo I'm specifically interested in how we, as humans,
p8
aVrelate to ourselves, each other
p9
aVand the world around us.
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aVSo just to give you a bit of context,
p12
aVas June said, I'm an artist, a technologist and an educator.
p13
aVI teach courses in physical computing
p14
aVand wearable electronics.
p15
aVAnd much of what I do is either wearable
p16
aVor somehow related to the human form.
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd so anytime I talk about what I do,
p19
aVI like to just quickly address
p20
aVthe reason why bodies matter.
p21
aVAnd it's pretty simple.
p22
aVEverybody's got one \u2014 all of you.
p23
aVI can guarantee, everyone in this room,
p24
aVall of you over there, the people in the cushy seats,
p25
aVthe people up top with the laptops \u2014
p26
aVwe all have bodies.
p27
aVDon't be ashamed.
p28
aVIt's something that we have in common
p29
aVand they act as our primary interfaces for the world.
p30
aVAnd so when working as an interaction designer,
p31
aVor as an artist who deals with participation \u2014
p32
aVcreating things that live on, in or around the human form \u2014
p33
aVit's really a powerful space to work within.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo within my own work,
p36
aVI use a broad range of materials and tools.
p37
aVSo I communicate through everything from radio transceivers
p38
aVto funnels and plastic tubing.
p39
aVAnd to tell you a bit about the things that I make,
p40
aVthe easiest place to start the story
p41
aVis with a hat.
p42
aVAnd so it all started several years ago,
p43
aVlate one night when I was sitting on the subway, riding home,
p44
aVand I was thinking.
p45
aVAnd I tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little.
p46
aVAnd so I was thinking about how it might be great
p47
aVif I could just take all these noises \u2014
p48
aVlike all these sounds of my thoughts in my head \u2014
p49
aVif I could just physically extricate them
p50
aVand pull them out in such a form
p51
aVthat I could share them with somebody else.
p52
aVAnd so I went home, and I made a prototype of this hat.
p53
aVAnd I called it the Muttering Hat,
p54
aVbecause it emitted these muttering noises
p55
aVthat were kind of tethered to you,
p56
aVbut you could detach them
p57
aVand share them with somebody else.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VSo I make other hats as well.
p62
aVThis one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat.
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aVIt's fairly self-explanatory.
p65
aVIt physically carves out conversation space for one.
p66
aVAnd when you speak out loud,
p67
aVthe sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears.
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aVAnd so when I make these things,
p70
aVit's really not so much about the object itself,
p71
aVbut rather the negative space around the object.
p72
aVSo what happens when a person puts this thing on?
p73
aVWhat kind of an experience do they have?
p74
aVAnd how are they transformed by wearing it?
p75
aa(lp76
VSo many of these devices
p77
aVreally kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves.
p78
aVSo this particular device is called the Gut Listener.
p79
aVAnd it is a tool
p80
aVthat actually enables one
p81
aVto listen to their own innards.
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aVAnd so some of these things
p84
aVare actually more geared toward expression and communication.
p85
aVAnd so the Inflatable Heart
p86
aVis an external organ
p87
aVthat can be used by the wearer to express themselves.
p88
aVSo they can actually inflate it and deflate it
p89
aVaccording to their emotions.
p90
aVSo they can express everything from admiration and lust
p91
aVto anxiety and angst.
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aVAnd some of these are actually meant
p94
aVto mediate experiences.
p95
aVSo the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments.
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVAnd so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange,
p98
aVbut is serves to absorb
p99
aVthe specificity of the words that are delivered.
p100
aV(Laughter)
p101
aVAnd in the end,
p102
aVsome of these things just act as invitations.
p103
aVSo the Ear Bender literally puts something out there
p104
aVso someone can grab your ear
p105
aVand say what they have to say.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo even though I'm really interested in the relationship
p108
aVbetween people,
p109
aVI also consider the ways
p110
aVin which we relate to the world around us.
p111
aVAnd so when I was first living in New York City a few years back,
p112
aVI was thinking a lot about
p113
aVthe familiar architectural forms that surrounded me
p114
aVand how I would like to better relate to them.
p115
aVAnd I thought, "Well, hey!
p116
aVMaybe if I want to better relate to walls,
p117
aVmaybe I need to be more wall-like myself."
p118
aVSo I made a wearable wall
p119
aVthat I could wear as a backpack.
p120
aVAnd so I would put it on
p121
aVand sort of physically transform myself
p122
aVso that I could either contribute to or critique
p123
aVthe spaces that surrounded me.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd so jumping off of that,
p128
aVthinking beyond the built environment into the natural world,
p129
aVI have this ongoing project called Botanicalls \u2014
p130
aVwhich actually enables houseplants
p131
aVto tap into human communication protocols.
p132
aVSo when a plant is thirsty,
p133
aVit can actually make a phone call
p134
aVor post a message to a service like Twitter.
p135
aVAnd so this really shifts the human/plant dynamic,
p136
aVbecause a single house plant
p137
aVcan actually express its needs
p138
aVto thousands of people at the same time.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd so kind of thinking about scale,
p141
aVmy most recent obsession
p142
aVis actually with glaciers \u2014 of course.
p143
aVAnd so glaciers are these magnificent beings,
p144
aVand there's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them,
p145
aVbut what I'm particularly interested in
p146
aVis in human-glacier relations.
p147
aV(Laughter)
p148
aVBecause there seems to be an issue.
p149
aVThe glaciers are actually leaving us.
p150
aVThey're both shrinking and retreating \u2014
p151
aVand some of them have disappeared altogether.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd so I actually live in Canada now,
p154
aVso I've been visiting one of my local glaciers.
p155
aVAnd this one's particularly interesting,
p156
aVbecause, of all the glaciers in North America,
p157
aVit receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year.
p158
aVThey actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine
p159
aVand drop people off on the surface of the glacier.
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd this has really gotten me thinking
p162
aVabout this experience of the initial encounter.
p163
aVWhen I meet a glacier for the very first time,
p164
aVwhat do I do?
p165
aVThere's no kind of social protocol for this.
p166
aVI really just don't even know
p167
aVhow to say hello.
p168
aVDo I carve a message in the snow?
p169
aVOr perhaps I can assemble one
p170
aVout of dot and dash ice cubes \u2014
p171
aVice cube Morse code.
p172
aVOr perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool,
p173
aVlike an icy megaphone
p174
aVthat I can use to amplify my voice
p175
aVwhen I direct it at the ice.
p176
aVBut really the most satisfying experience I've had
p177
aVis the act of listening,
p178
aVwhich is what we need in any good relationship.
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd I was really struck by how much it affected me.
p181
aVThis very basic shift in my physical orientation
p182
aVhelped me shift my perspective
p183
aVin relation to the glacier.
p184
aVAnd so since we use devices
p185
aVto figure out how to relate to the world these days,
p186
aVI actually made a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit.
p187
aV(Laughter)
p188
aVAnd so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material
p189
aVthat serves to mediate the difference in temperature
p190
aVbetween the human body and the glacial ice.
p191
aVAnd once again, it's this invitation
p192
aVthat asks people to lay down on the glacier
p193
aVand give it a hug.
p194
aa(lp195
VSo, yea, this is actually just the beginning.
p196
aVThese are initial musings for this project.
p197
aVAnd just as with the wall, how I wanted to be more wall-like,
p198
aVwith this project, I'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace.
p199
aVAnd so my intent
p200
aVis to actually just take the next 10 years
p201
aVand go on a series of collaborative projects
p202
aVwhere I work with people from different disciplines \u2014
p203
aVartists, technologists, scientists \u2014
p204
aVto kind of work on this project
p205
aVof how we can improve human-glacier relations.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo beyond that, in closing,
p208
aVI'd just like to say that we're in this era
p209
aVof communications and device proliferation,
p210
aVand it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy,
p211
aVbut I think what's really important
p212
aVis thinking about how we can simultaneously
p213
aVmaintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality
p214
aVabout the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world.
p215
