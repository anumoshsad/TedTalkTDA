VHow much do you need to know about a person
p4
aVbefore you'd feel comfortable making a loan?
p5
aa(lp6
VSuppose you wanted to lend 1,000 dollars
p7
aVto the person sitting two rows behind you.
p8
aVWhat would you need to know about that person
p9
aVbefore you'd feel comfortable?
p10
aa(lp11
VMy mom came to the US from India in her late thirties.
p12
aVShe's a doctor in Brooklyn,
p13
aVand she often lets friends and neighbors come to see her for health services,
p14
aVwhether they can pay right away or not.
p15
aVI remember running into her patients with her at the grocery store
p16
aVor on the sidewalk,
p17
aVand sometimes they would come and pay her right on the spot
p18
aVfor previous appointments.
p19
aVShe would thank them,
p20
aVand ask them about their families and their health.
p21
aVShe gave them credit because she trusted them.
p22
aa(lp23
VMost of us are like my mom.
p24
aVWe would give credit to someone we know
p25
aVor that we live next to.
p26
aVBut most of us are probably not going to lend to a stranger
p27
aVunless we know a little something about them.
p28
aa(lp29
VBanks, credit card companies and other financial institutions
p30
aVdon't know us on a personal level,
p31
aVbut they do have a way of trusting us,
p32
aVand that's through our credit scores.
p33
aVOur credit scores have been created
p34
aVthrough an aggregation and analysis of our public consumer credit data.
p35
aVAnd because of them, we have pretty much easy access
p36
aVto all of the goods and services that we need,
p37
aVfrom getting electricity to buying a home,
p38
aVor taking a risk and starting a business.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut ...
p41
aVthere are 2.5 billion people around the world
p42
aVthat don't have a credit score.
p43
aVThat's a third of the world's population.
p44
aVThey don't have a score
p45
aVbecause there are no formal public records on them \u2014
p46
aVno bank accounts,
p47
aVno credit histories
p48
aVand no social security numbers.
p49
aVAnd because they don't have a score,
p50
aVthey don't have access to the credit or financial products
p51
aVthat can improve their lives.
p52
aVThey are not trusted.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo we wanted to find a way to build trust
p55
aVand to open up financial access for these 2.5 billion.
p56
aVSo we created a mobile application
p57
aVthat builds credit scores for them using mobile data.
p58
aVThere are currently over one billion smartphones in emerging markets.
p59
aVAnd people are using them the same way that we do.
p60
aVThey're texting their friends, they're looking up directions,
p61
aVthey're browsing the Internet
p62
aVand they're even making financial transactions.
p63
aa(lp64
VOver time, this data is getting captured on our phones,
p65
aVand it provides a really rich picture of a person's life.
p66
aVOur customers give us access to this data
p67
aVand we capture it through our mobile application.
p68
aVIt helps us understand the creditworthiness
p69
aVof people like Jenipher, a small-business owner in Nairobi, Kenya.
p70
aVJenipher is 65 years old, and for decades has been running a food stall
p71
aVin the central business district.
p72
aVShe has three sons who she put through vocational school,
p73
aVand she's also the leader of her local chama,
p74
aVor savings group.
p75
aa(lp76
VJenipher's food stall does well.
p77
aVShe makes just enough every day to cover her expenses.
p78
aVBut she's not financially secure.
p79
aVAny emergency could force her into debt.
p80
aVAnd she has no discretionary income
p81
aVto improve her family's way of living,
p82
aVfor emergencies,
p83
aVor for investing into growing her business.
p84
aVIf Jenipher wants credit, her options are limited.
p85
aVShe could get a microloan,
p86
aVbut she'd have to form a group that could help vouch for her credibility.
p87
aVAnd even then, the loan sizes would be way too small
p88
aVto really have an impact on her business,
p89
aVaveraging around 150 dollars.
p90
aVLoan sharks are always an option,
p91
aVbut with interest rates that are well above 300 percent,
p92
aVthey're financially risky.
p93
aVAnd because Jenipher doesn't have collateral or a credit history,
p94
aVshe can't walk into a bank and ask for a business loan.
p95
aa(lp96
VBut one day,
p97
aVJenipher's son convinced her to download our application
p98
aVand apply for a loan.
p99
aVJenipher answered a few questions on her phone
p100
aVand she gave us access to a few key data points on her device.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd here's what we saw.
p103
aVSo, bad news first.
p104
aVJenipher had a low savings balance and no previous loan history.
p105
aVThese are factors
p106
aVthat would have thrown up a red flag to a traditional bank.
p107
aVBut there were other points in her history that showed us
p108
aVa much richer picture of her potential.
p109
aVSo for one,
p110
aVwe saw that she made regular phone calls to her family in Uganda.
p111
aVWell, it turns out that the data shows
p112
aVa four percent increase in repayment
p113
aVamong people who consistently communicate with a few close contacts.
p114
aVWe could also see
p115
aVthat though she traveled around a lot throughout the day,
p116
aVshe actually had pretty regular travel patterns,
p117
aVand she was either at home or at her food stall.
p118
aVAnd the data shows a six percent increase in repayment
p119
aVamong customers who are consistent
p120
aVwith where they spend most of their time.
p121
aa(lp122
VWe could also see that she communicated a lot
p123
aVwith many different people throughout the day
p124
aVand that she had a strong support network.
p125
aVOur data shows
p126
aVthat people who communicate with more than 58 different contacts
p127
aVtend to be more likely to be good borrowers.
p128
aVIn Jenipher's case,
p129
aVshe communicated with 89 different individuals,
p130
aVwhich showed a nine percent increase in her repayment.
p131
aa(lp132
VThese are just some of the thousands of different data points
p133
aVthat we look at to understand a person's creditworthiness.
p134
aVAnd after analyzing all of these different data points,
p135
aVwe took the first risk
p136
aVand gave Jenipher a loan.
p137
aVThis is data that would not be found on a paper trail
p138
aVor in any formal financial record.
p139
aVBut it proves trust.
p140
aVBy looking beyond income,
p141
aVwe can see that people in emerging markets
p142
aVthat may seem risky and unpredictable on the surface
p143
aVare actually willing and have the capacity to repay.
p144
aa(lp145
VOur credit scores have helped us deliver over 200,000 loans in Kenya
p146
aVin just the past year.
p147
aVAnd our repayment rates are above 90 percent \u2014
p148
aVwhich, by the way, is in line with traditional bank repayment rates.
p149
aa(lp150
VWith something as simple as a credit score,
p151
aVwe're giving people the power to build their own futures.
p152
aVOur customers have used their loans for family expenses,
p153
aVemergencies, travel
p154
aVand for investing back into growing their businesses.
p155
aVThey're now building better economies and communities
p156
aVwhere more people can succeed.
p157
aa(lp158
VOver the past two years of using our product,
p159
aVJenipher has increased her savings by 60 percent.
p160
aVShe's also started two additional food stalls
p161
aVand is now making plans for her own restaurant.
p162
aVShe's applying for a small-business loan from a commercial bank,
p163
aVbecause she now has the credit history to prove she deserves it.
p164
aa(lp165
VI saw Jenipher in Nairobi just last week,
p166
aVand she told me how excited she was to get started.
p167
aVShe said,
p168
aV"Only my son believed I could do this. I didn't think this was for me."
p169
aVShe's lived her whole life
p170
aVbelieving that there was a part of the world that was closed off to her.
p171
aa(lp172
VOur job now is to open the world to Jenipher
p173
aVand the billions like her that deserve to be trusted.
p174
aa(lp175
VThank you.
