VSo, I kind of believe that we're in like the "cave-painting" era of computer interfaces.
p4
aVLike, they're very kind of \u2014 they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be
p5
aVand I'd like to change all that.
p6
aVHit me.
p7
aVOK. So I mean, this is the kind of status quo interface, right?
p8
aVIt's very flat, kind of rigid.
p9
aVAnd OK, so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac,
p10
aVyou know, but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last,
p11
aVyou know, 30 years.
p12
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p13
aVLike I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers.
p14
aVI mean it's point and click, it's like the menus, icons, it's all the kind of same thing.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk.
p17
aVIt's so much more subtle, so much more visceral
p18
aV\u2014 you know, what's visible, what's not.
p19
aVAnd I'd like to bring that experience to the desktop.
p20
aVSo I kind of have a \u2014 this is BumpTop.
p21
aVIt's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing.
p22
aVSo you can bump things \u2014 they're all physically, you know, manipulable and stuff.
p23
aVAnd instead of that point and click, it's like a push and pull,
p24
aVthings collide as you'd expect them. Just like on my real desk,
p25
aVI can \u2014 let me just grab these guys \u2014 I can turn things into piles
p26
aVinstead of just the folders that we have.
p27
aVAnd once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid,
p28
aVor you know, flip through them like a book
p29
aVor I can lay them out like a deck of cards.
p30
aVWhen they're laid out, I can pull things to new locations or delete things
p31
aVor just quickly sort a whole pile, you know, just immediately, right?
p32
aVAnd then, it's all smoothly animated, instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces.
p33
aa(lp34
VAlso, if I want to add something to a pile, well, how do I do that?
p35
aVI just toss it to the pile, and it's added right to the top. It's a kind of nice way.
p36
aVAlso some of the stuff we can do is,
p37
aVfor these individual icons we thought \u2014 I mean,
p38
aVhow can we play with the idea of an icon, and push that further?
p39
aVAnd one of the things I can do is make it bigger
p40
aVif I want to emphasize it and make it more important.
p41
aa(lp42
VBut what's really cool is that since there's a physics simulation running under this,
p43
aVit's actually heavier. So the lighter stuff doesn't really move
p44
aVbut if I throw it at the lighter guys, right?
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aVSo it's cute, but it's also like a subtle channel of conveying information, right?
p47
aVThis is heavy so it feels more important. So it's kind of cool.
p48
aa(lp49
VDespite computers everywhere paper really hasn't disappeared,
p50
aVbecause it has a lot of, I think, valuable properties.
p51
aVAnd some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system.
p52
aVSo one of the things you can do to our icons, just like paper, is crease them and fold them,
p53
aVjust like paper. Remember, you know, something for later.
p54
aVOr if you want to be destructive, you can just crumple it up
p55
aVand, you know, toss it to the corner.
p56
aVAlso just like paper, around our workspace
p57
aVwe'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later,
p58
aVand I can do the same thing here,
p59
aVand you know, you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices.
p60
aVAnd I can pull them off when I want to work with them.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo, one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that,
p63
aVyou know, "Okay, well my real desk is really messy. I don't want that mess on my computer."
p64
aVSo one thing we have for that is like a grid align,
p65
aVkind of \u2014 so you get that more traditional desktop. Things are kind of grid aligned.
p66
aVMore boring, but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping.
p67
aVAnd you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop.
p68
aa(lp69
VLet's just break this shelf. Okay, that shelf broke.
p70
aVI think beyond the icons, I think another really cool domain for this software \u2014
p71
aVI think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop \u2014 but browsing photographs.
p72
aVI think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs
p73
aVand bring it to that kind of shoebox of, you know, photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing.
p74
aVI can toss these things around. They're so much more tangible and touchable \u2014
p75
aVand you know I can double-click on something to take a look at it.
p76
aVAnd I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before.
p77
aVSo I can pile things up, I can flip through it, I can, you know \u2014
p78
aVokay, let's move this photo to the back, let's delete this guy here,
p79
aVand I think it's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd that's BumpTop. Thanks!
