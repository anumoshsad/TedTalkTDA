VI know what you're thinking.
p4
aVYou think I've lost my way,
p5
aVand somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute
p6
aVand guide me gently back to my seat.
p7
aV(Applause)
p8
aVI get that all the time in Dubai.
p9
aV"Here on holiday are you, dear?"
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aV"Come to visit the children?
p12
aVHow long are you staying?"
p13
aa(lp14
VWell actually, I hope for a while longer yet.
p15
aVI have been living and teaching in the Gulf
p16
aVfor over 30 years.
p17
aV(Applause)
p18
aVAnd in that time, I have seen a lot of changes.
p19
aVNow that statistic
p20
aVis quite shocking.
p21
aVAnd I want to talk to you today
p22
aVabout language loss
p23
aVand the globalization of English.
p24
aVI want to tell you about my friend
p25
aVwho was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi.
p26
aVAnd one fine day,
p27
aVshe decided to take them into the garden
p28
aVto teach them some nature vocabulary.
p29
aVBut it was she who ended up learning
p30
aVall the Arabic words for the local plants,
p31
aVas well as their uses \u2014
p32
aVmedicinal uses, cosmetics,
p33
aVcooking, herbal.
p34
aVHow did those students get all that knowledge?
p35
aVOf course, from their grandparents
p36
aVand even their great-grandparents.
p37
aVIt's not necessary to tell you how important it is
p38
aVto be able to communicate
p39
aVacross generations.
p40
aa(lp41
VBut sadly, today,
p42
aVlanguages are dying
p43
aVat an unprecedented rate.
p44
aVA language dies every 14 days.
p45
aVNow, at the same time,
p46
aVEnglish is the undisputed global language.
p47
aVCould there be a connection?
p48
aVWell I don't know.
p49
aVBut I do know that I've seen a lot of changes.
p50
aVWhen I first came out to the Gulf, I came to Kuwait
p51
aVin the days when it was still a hardship post.
p52
aVActually, not that long ago.
p53
aVThat is a little bit too early.
p54
aVBut nevertheless,
p55
aVI was recruited by the British Council,
p56
aValong with about 25 other teachers.
p57
aVAnd we were the first non-Muslims
p58
aVto teach in the state schools there in Kuwait.
p59
aVWe were brought to teach English
p60
aVbecause the government wanted to modernize the country
p61
aVand to empower the citizens through education.
p62
aVAnd of course, the U.K. benefited
p63
aVfrom some of that lovely oil wealth.
p64
aa(lp65
VOkay.
p66
aVNow this is the major change that I've seen \u2014
p67
aVhow teaching English
p68
aVhas morphed
p69
aVfrom being a mutually beneficial practice
p70
aVto becoming a massive international business that it is today.
p71
aVNo longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum,
p72
aVand no longer the sole domain
p73
aVof mother England,
p74
aVit has become a bandwagon
p75
aVfor every English-speaking nation on earth.
p76
aVAnd why not?
p77
aVAfter all, the best education \u2014
p78
aVaccording to the latest World University Rankings \u2014
p79
aVis to be found in the universities
p80
aVof the U.K. and the U.S.
p81
aVSo everybody wants to have an English education, naturally.
p82
aVBut if you're not a native speaker,
p83
aVyou have to pass a test.
p84
aa(lp85
VNow can it be right
p86
aVto reject a student
p87
aVon linguistic ability alone?
p88
aVPerhaps you have a computer scientist
p89
aVwho's a genius.
p90
aVWould he need the same language as a lawyer, for example?
p91
aVWell, I don't think so.
p92
aVWe English teachers reject them all the time.
p93
aVWe put a stop sign,
p94
aVand we stop them in their tracks.
p95
aVThey can't pursue their dream any longer,
p96
aV'til they get English.
p97
aVNow let me put it this way:
p98
aVif I met a monolingual Dutch speaker
p99
aVwho had the cure for cancer,
p100
aVwould I stop him from entering my British University?
p101
aVI don't think so.
p102
aVBut indeed, that is exactly what we do.
p103
aVWe English teachers are the gatekeepers.
p104
aVAnd you have to satisfy us first
p105
aVthat your English is good enough.
p106
aVNow it can be dangerous
p107
aVto give too much power
p108
aVto a narrow segment of society.
p109
aVMaybe the barrier would be too universal.
p110
aa(lp111
VOkay.
p112
aV"But," I hear you say,
p113
aV"what about the research?
p114
aVIt's all in English."
p115
aVSo the books are in English,
p116
aVthe journals are done in English,
p117
aVbut that is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
p118
aVIt feeds the English requirement.
p119
aVAnd so it goes on.
p120
aVI ask you, what happened to translation?
p121
aVIf you think about the Islamic Golden Age,
p122
aVthere was lots of translation then.
p123
aVThey translated from Latin and Greek
p124
aVinto Arabic, into Persian,
p125
aVand then it was translated on
p126
aVinto the Germanic languages of Europe
p127
aVand the Romance languages.
p128
aVAnd so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe.
p129
aVNow don't get me wrong;
p130
aVI am not against teaching English,
p131
aVall you English teachers out there.
p132
aVI love it that we have a global language.
p133
aVWe need one today more than ever.
p134
aVBut I am against using it
p135
aVas a barrier.
p136
aVDo we really want to end up with 600 languages
p137
aVand the main one being English, or Chinese?
p138
aVWe need more than that. Where do we draw the line?
p139
aVThis system
p140
aVequates intelligence
p141
aVwith a knowledge of English,
p142
aVwhich is quite arbitrary.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Applause)
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd I want to remind you
p147
aVthat the giants upon whose shoulders
p148
aVtoday's intelligentsia stand
p149
aVdid not have to have English,
p150
aVthey didn't have to pass an English test.
p151
aVCase in point, Einstein.
p152
aVHe, by the way, was considered remedial at school
p153
aVbecause he was, in fact, dyslexic.
p154
aVBut fortunately for the world,
p155
aVhe did not have to pass an English test.
p156
aVBecause they didn't start until 1964
p157
aVwith TOEFL,
p158
aVthe American test of English.
p159
aVNow it's exploded.
p160
aVThere are lots and lots of tests of English.
p161
aVAnd millions and millions of students
p162
aVtake these tests every year.
p163
aVNow you might think, you and me,
p164
aV"Those fees aren't bad, they're okay,"
p165
aVbut they are prohibitive
p166
aVto so many millions of poor people.
p167
aVSo immediately, we're rejecting them.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Applause)
p170
aa(lp171
VIt brings to mind a headline I saw recently:
p172
aV"Education: The Great Divide."
p173
aVNow I get it,
p174
aVI understand why people would want to focus on English.
p175
aVThey want to give their children the best chance in life.
p176
aVAnd to do that, they need a Western education.
p177
aVBecause, of course, the best jobs
p178
aVgo to people out of the Western Universities,
p179
aVthat I put on earlier.
p180
aVIt's a circular thing.
p181
aa(lp182
VOkay.
p183
aVLet me tell you a story about two scientists,
p184
aVtwo English scientists.
p185
aVThey were doing an experiment
p186
aVto do with genetics
p187
aVand the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals.
p188
aVBut they couldn't get the results they wanted.
p189
aVThey really didn't know what to do,
p190
aVuntil along came a German scientist
p191
aVwho realized that they were using two words
p192
aVfor forelimb and hind limb,
p193
aVwhereas genetics does not differentiate
p194
aVand neither does German.
p195
aVSo bingo,
p196
aVproblem solved.
p197
aVIf you can't think a thought,
p198
aVyou are stuck.
p199
aVBut if another language can think that thought,
p200
aVthen, by cooperating,
p201
aVwe can achieve and learn so much more.
p202
aa(lp203
VMy daughter
p204
aVcame to England from Kuwait.
p205
aVShe had studied science and mathematics in Arabic.
p206
aVIt's an Arabic-medium school.
p207
aVShe had to translate it into English at her grammar school.
p208
aVAnd she was the best in the class
p209
aVat those subjects.
p210
aVWhich tells us
p211
aVthat when students come to us from abroad,
p212
aVwe may not be giving them enough credit
p213
aVfor what they know,
p214
aVand they know it in their own language.
p215
aVWhen a language dies,
p216
aVwe don't know what we lose with that language.
p217
aa(lp218
VThis is \u2014 I don't know if you saw it on CNN recently \u2014
p219
aVthey gave the Heroes Award
p220
aVto a young Kenyan shepherd boy
p221
aVwho couldn't study at night in his village,
p222
aVlike all the village children,
p223
aVbecause the kerosene lamp,
p224
aVit had smoke and it damaged his eyes.
p225
aVAnd anyway, there was never enough kerosene,
p226
aVbecause what does a dollar a day buy for you?
p227
aVSo he invented
p228
aVa cost-free solar lamp.
p229
aVAnd now the children in his village
p230
aVget the same grades at school
p231
aVas the children who have electricity at home.
p232
aV(Applause)
p233
aVWhen he received his award,
p234
aVhe said these lovely words:
p235
aV"The children can lead Africa from what it is today,
p236
aVa dark continent,
p237
aVto a light continent."
p238
aVA simple idea,
p239
aVbut it could have such far-reaching consequences.
p240
aa(lp241
VPeople who have no light,
p242
aVwhether it's physical or metaphorical,
p243
aVcannot pass our exams,
p244
aVand we can never know what they know.
p245
aVLet us not keep them and ourselves
p246
aVin the dark.
p247
aVLet us celebrate diversity.
p248
aVMind your language.
p249
aVUse it to spread great ideas.
