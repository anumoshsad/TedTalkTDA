VWhat does a working mother look like?
p4
aVIf you ask the Internet, this is what you'll be told.
p5
aVNever mind that this is what you'll actually produce
p6
aVif you attempt to work at a computer with a baby on your lap.
p7
aa(lp8
V(Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VBut no, this isn't a working mother.
p11
aVYou'll notice a theme in these photos. We'll look at a lot of them.
p12
aVThat theme is amazing natural lighting,
p13
aVwhich, as we all know,
p14
aVis the hallmark of every American workplace.
p15
aa(lp16
VThere are thousands of images like these.
p17
aVJust put the term "working mother" into any Google image search engine,
p18
aVstock photo site.
p19
aVThey're all over the Internet,
p20
aVthey're topping blog posts and news pieces,
p21
aVand I've become kind of obsessed with them and the lie that they tell us
p22
aVand the comfort that they give us,
p23
aVthat when it comes to new working motherhood in America,
p24
aVeverything's fine.
p25
aa(lp26
VBut it's not fine.
p27
aVAs a country, we are sending millions of women back to work
p28
aVevery year, incredibly and kind of horrifically soon
p29
aVafter they give birth.
p30
aVThat's a moral problem
p31
aVbut today I'm also going to tell you why it's an economic problem.
p32
aa(lp33
VI got so annoyed and obsessed with the unreality of these images,
p34
aVwhich look nothing like my life,
p35
aVthat I recently decided to shoot and star in a parody series of stock photos
p36
aVthat I hoped the world would start to use
p37
aVjust showing the really awkward reality of going back to work
p38
aVwhen your baby's food source is attached to your body.
p39
aVI'm just going to show you two of them.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VNothing says "Give that girl a promotion" like leaking breast milk
p44
aVthrough your dress during a presentation.
p45
aVYou'll notice that there's no baby in this photo,
p46
aVbecause that's not how this works,
p47
aVnot for most working mothers.
p48
aa(lp49
VDid you know, and this will ruin your day,
p50
aVthat every time a toilet is flushed, its contents are aerosolized
p51
aVand they'll stay airborne for hours?
p52
aVAnd yet, for many new working mothers,
p53
aVthis is the only place during the day that they can find to make food
p54
aVfor their newborn babies.
p55
aa(lp56
VI put these things, a whole dozen of them, into the world.
p57
aVI wanted to make a point.
p58
aVI didn't know what I was also doing was opening a door,
p59
aVbecause now, total strangers from all walks of life
p60
aVwrite to me all the time
p61
aVjust to tell me what it's like for them to go back to work
p62
aVwithin days or weeks of having a baby.
p63
aVI'm going to share 10 of their stories with you today.
p64
aVThey are totally real, some of them are very raw,
p65
aVand not one of them looks anything like this.
p66
aa(lp67
VHere's the first.
p68
aV"I was an active duty service member at a federal prison.
p69
aVI returned to work after the maximum allowed eight weeks for my C-section.
p70
aVA male coworker was annoyed that I had been out on 'vacation,'
p71
aVso he intentionally opened the door on me while I was pumping breast milk
p72
aVand stood in the doorway with inmates in the hallway."
p73
aa(lp74
VMost of the stories that these women, total strangers, send to me now,
p75
aVare not actually even about breastfeeding.
p76
aa(lp77
VA woman wrote to me to say,
p78
aV"I gave birth to twins and went back to work after seven unpaid weeks.
p79
aVEmotionally, I was a wreck.
p80
aVPhysically, I had a severe hemorrhage during labor, and major tearing,
p81
aVso I could barely get up, sit or walk.
p82
aVMy employer told me I wasn't allowed to use my available vacation days
p83
aVbecause it was budget season."
p84
aa(lp85
VI've come to believe that we can't look situations like these in the eye
p86
aVbecause then we'd be horrified,
p87
aVand if we get horrified then we have to do something about it.
p88
aVSo we choose to look at, and believe, this image.
p89
aVI don't really know what's going on in this picture,
p90
aVbecause I find it weird and slightly creepy.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VLike, what is she doing?
p95
aVBut I know what it tells us.
p96
aVIt tells us that everything's fine.
p97
aVThis working mother, all working mothers and all of their babies, are fine.
p98
aVThere's nothing to see here.
p99
aVAnd anyway, women have made a choice,
p100
aVso none of it's even our problem.
p101
aa(lp102
VI want to break this choice thing down into two parts.
p103
aVThe first choice says that women have chosen to work.
p104
aVSo, that's not true.
p105
aVToday in America, women make up 47 percent of the workforce,
p106
aVand in 40 percent of American households
p107
aVa woman is the sole or primary breadwinner.
p108
aVOur paid work is a part, a huge part, of the engine of this economy,
p109
aVand it is essential for the engines of our families.
p110
aVOn a national level, our paid work is not optional.
p111
aa(lp112
VChoice number two says that women are choosing to have babies,
p113
aVso women alone should bear the consequences of those choices.
p114
aVYou know, that's one of those things
p115
aVthat when you hear it in passing, can sound correct.
p116
aVI didn't make you have a baby.
p117
aVI certainly wasn't there when that happened.
p118
aVBut that stance ignores a fundamental truth,
p119
aVwhich is that our procreation on a national scale is not optional.
p120
aVThe babies that women, many of them working women, are having today,
p121
aVwill one day fill our workforce, protect our shores,
p122
aVmake up our tax base.
p123
aVOur procreation on a national scale is not optional.
p124
aVThese aren't choices.
p125
aVWe need women to work. We need working women to have babies.
p126
aVSo we should make doing those things at the same time
p127
aVat least palatable, right?
p128
aa(lp129
VOK, this is pop quiz time:
p130
aVwhat percentage of working women in America do you think
p131
aVhave no access to paid maternity leave?
p132
aV88 percent.
p133
aV88 percent of working mothers will not get one minute of paid leave
p134
aVafter they have a baby.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo now you're thinking about unpaid leave.
p137
aVIt exists in America. It's called FMLA. It does not work.
p138
aVBecause of the way it's structured, all kinds of exceptions,
p139
aVhalf of new mothers are ineligible for it.
p140
aa(lp141
VHere's what that looks like.
p142
aV"We adopted our son.
p143
aVWhen I got the call, the day he was born, I had to take off work.
p144
aVI had not been there long enough to qualify for FMLA,
p145
aVso I wasn't eligible for unpaid leave.
p146
aVWhen I took time off to meet my newborn son,
p147
aVI lost my job."
p148
aa(lp149
VThese corporate stock photos hide another reality, another layer.
p150
aVOf those who do have access to just that unpaid leave,
p151
aVmost women can't afford to take much of it at all.
p152
aVA nurse told me, "I didn't qualify for short-term disability
p153
aVbecause my pregnancy was considered a preexisting condition.
p154
aVWe used up all of our tax returns and half of our savings
p155
aVduring my six unpaid weeks.
p156
aVWe just couldn't manage any longer.
p157
aVPhysically it was hard, but emotionally it was worse.
p158
aVI struggled for months being away from my son."
p159
aa(lp160
VSo this decision to go back to work so early,
p161
aVit's a rational economic decision driven by family finances,
p162
aVbut it's often physically horrific
p163
aVbecause putting a human into the world is messy.
p164
aa(lp165
VA waitress told me,
p166
aV"With my first baby, I was back at work five weeks postpartum.
p167
aVWith my second, I had to have major surgery after giving birth,
p168
aVso I waited until six weeks to go back.
p169
aVI had third degree tears."
p170
aa(lp171
V23 percent of new working mothers in America
p172
aVwill be back on the job within two weeks of giving birth.
p173
aa(lp174
V"I worked as a bartender and cook, average of 75 hours a week while pregnant.
p175
aVI had to return to work before my baby was a month old,
p176
aVworking 60 hours a week.
p177
aVOne of my coworkers was only able to afford 10 days off with her baby."
p178
aa(lp179
VOf course, this isn't just a scenario with economic and physical implications.
p180
aVChildbirth is, and always will be, an enormous psychological event.
p181
aa(lp182
VA teacher told me,
p183
aV"I returned to work eight weeks after my son was born.
p184
aVI already suffer from anxiety,
p185
aVbut the panic attacks I had prior to returning to work were unbearable."
p186
aa(lp187
VStatistically speaking,
p188
aVthe shorter a woman's leave after having a baby,
p189
aVthe more likely she will be to suffer from postpartum mood disorders
p190
aVlike depression and anxiety,
p191
aVand among many potential consequences of those disorders,
p192
aVsuicide is the second most common cause of death
p193
aVin a woman's first year postpartum.
p194
aa(lp195
VHeads up that this next story \u2014
p196
aVI've never met this woman, but I find it hard to get through.
p197
aa(lp198
V"I feel tremendous grief and rage that I lost an essential,
p199
aVirreplaceable and formative time with my son.
p200
aVLabor and delivery left me feeling absolutely broken.
p201
aVFor months, all I remember is the screaming: colic, they said.
p202
aVOn the inside, I was drowning.
p203
aVEvery morning, I asked myself how much longer I could do it.
p204
aVI was allowed to bring my baby to work.
p205
aVI closed my office door while I rocked and shushed
p206
aVand begged him to stop screaming so I wouldn't get in trouble.
p207
aVI hid behind that office door every damn day
p208
aVand cried while he screamed.
p209
aVI cried in the bathroom while I washed out the pump equipment.
p210
aVEvery day, I cried all the way to work and all the way home again.
p211
aVI promised my boss that the work I didn't get done during the day,
p212
aVI'd make up at night from home.
p213
aVI thought, there's just something wrong with me that I can't swing this."
p214
aa(lp215
VSo those are the mothers.
p216
aVWhat of the babies?
p217
aVAs a country, do we care about the millions of babies
p218
aVborn every year to working mothers?
p219
aVI say we don't,
p220
aVnot until they're of working and tax-paying and military-serving age.
p221
aVWe tell them we'll see them in 18 years,
p222
aVand getting there is kind of on them.
p223
aVOne of the reasons I know this is that babies whose mothers
p224
aVhave 12 or more weeks at home with them
p225
aVare more likely to get their vaccinations and their well checks in their first year,
p226
aVso those babies are more protected from deadly and disabling diseases.
p227
aVBut those things are hidden behind images like this.
p228
aa(lp229
VAmerica has a message for new mothers who work and for their babies.
p230
aVWhatever time you get together, you should be grateful for it,
p231
aVand you're an inconvenience
p232
aVto the economy and to your employers.
p233
aVThat narrative of gratitude runs through a lot of the stories I hear.
p234
aa(lp235
VA woman told me,
p236
aV"I went back at eight weeks after my C-section
p237
aVbecause my husband was out of work.
p238
aVWithout me, my daughter had failure to thrive.
p239
aVShe wouldn't take a bottle.
p240
aVShe started losing weight.
p241
aVThankfully, my manager was very understanding.
p242
aVHe let my mom bring my baby,
p243
aVwho was on oxygen and a monitor,
p244
aVfour times a shift so I could nurse her."
p245
aa(lp246
VThere's a little club of countries in the world
p247
aVthat offer no national paid leave to new mothers.
p248
aVCare to guess who they are?
p249
aVThe first eight make up eight million in total population.
p250
aVThey are Papua New Guinea, Suriname and the tiny island nations
p251
aVof Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau and Tonga.
p252
aVNumber nine is the United States of America,
p253
aVwith 320 million people.
p254
aVOh, that's it.
p255
aVThat's the end of the list.
p256
aVEvery other economy on the planet
p257
aVhas found a way to make some level of national paid leave work
p258
aVfor the people doing the work of the future of those countries,
p259
aVbut we say, "We couldn't possibly do that."
p260
aVWe say that the market will solve this problem,
p261
aVand then we cheer when corporations offer even more paid leave to the women
p262
aVwho are already the highest-educated and highest-paid among us.
p263
aVRemember that 88 percent?
p264
aVThose middle- and low-income women are not going to participate in that.
p265
aVWe know that there are staggering economic, financial, physical
p266
aVand emotional costs to this approach.
p267
aVWe have decided \u2014 decided, not an accident,
p268
aVto pass these costs directly on to working mothers and their babies.
p269
aVWe know the price tag is higher for low-income women,
p270
aVtherefore disproportionately for women of color.
p271
aVWe pass them on anyway.
p272
aa(lp273
VAll of this is to America's shame.
p274
aVBut it's also to America's risk.
p275
aVBecause what would happen
p276
aVif all of these individual so-called choices to have babies
p277
aVstarted to turn into individual choices not to have babies.
p278
aa(lp279
VOne woman told me,
p280
aV"New motherhood is hard. It shouldn't be traumatic.
p281
aVWhen we talk about expanding our family now,
p282
aVwe focus on how much time I would have to care for myself and a new baby.
p283
aVIf we were to have to do it again the same way as with our first,
p284
aVwe might stick with one kid."
p285
aa(lp286
VThe birthrate needed in America to keep the population stable
p287
aVis 2.1 live births per woman.
p288
aVIn America today, we are at 1.86.
p289
aVWe need women to have babies,
p290
aVand we are actively disincentivizing working women from doing that.
p291
aVWhat would happen to work force, to innovation, to GDP,
p292
aVif one by one, the working mothers of this country were to decide
p293
aVthat they can't bear to do this thing more than once?
p294
aa(lp295
VI'm here today with only one idea worth spreading,
p296
aVand you've guessed what it is.
p297
aVIt is long since time for the most powerful country on Earth
p298
aVto offer national paid leave
p299
aVto the people doing the work of the future of this country
p300
aVand to the babies who represent that future.
p301
aVChildbirth is a public good.
p302
aVThis leave should be state-subsidized.
p303
aVIt should have no exceptions for small businesses,
p304
aVlength of employment or entrepreneurs.
p305
aVIt should be able to be shared between partners.
p306
aVI've talked today a lot about mothers,
p307
aVbut co-parents matter on so many levels.
p308
aa(lp309
VNot one more woman should have to go back to work
p310
aVwhile she is hobbling and bleeding.
p311
aVNot one more family should have to drain their savings account
p312
aVto buy a few days of rest and recovery and bonding.
p313
aVNot one more fragile infant
p314
aVshould have to go directly from the incubator to day care
p315
aVbecause his parents have used up all of their meager time
p316
aVsitting in the NICU.
p317
aVNot one more working family should be told that the collision
p318
aVof their work, their needed work and their needed parenthood,
p319
aVis their problem alone.
p320
aa(lp321
VThe catch is that when this is happening to a new family, it is consuming,
p322
aVand a family with a new baby is more financially vulnerable
p323
aVthan they've ever been before,
p324
aVso that new mother cannot afford to speak up on her own behalf.
p325
aVBut all of us have voices.
p326
aVI am done, done having babies,
p327
aVand you might be pre-baby,
p328
aVyou might be post-baby,
p329
aVyou might be no baby.
p330
aVIt should not matter.
p331
aVWe have to stop framing this as a mother's issue,
p332
aVor even a women's issue.
p333
aVThis is an American issue.
p334
aa(lp335
VWe need to stop buying the lie that these images tell us.
p336
aVWe need to stop being comforted by them.
p337
aVWe need to question why we're told that this can't work
p338
aVwhen we see it work everywhere all over the world.
p339
aVWe need to recognize that this American reality
p340
aVis to our dishonor and to our peril.
p341
aVBecause this is not,
p342
aVthis is not,
p343
aVand this is not what a working mother looks like.
