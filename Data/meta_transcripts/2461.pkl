VThousands of years from now,
p4
aVwe'll look back at the first century of computing
p5
aVas a fascinating but very peculiar time \u2014
p6
aVthe only time in history where humans were reduced to live in 2D space,
p7
aVinteracting with technology as if we were machines;
p8
aVa singular, 100-year period in the vastness of time
p9
aVwhere humans communicated,
p10
aVwere entertained and managed their lives
p11
aVfrom behind a screen.
p12
aa(lp13
VToday, we spend most of our time tapping and looking at screens.
p14
aVWhat happened to interacting with each other?
p15
aVI don't know about you, but I feel limited
p16
aVinside this 2D world of monitors and pixels.
p17
aVAnd it is this very limitation
p18
aVand my desire to connect with people
p19
aVthat inspires me as a creator.
p20
aVPut simply: I want to create a new reality,
p21
aVa reality where technology brings us infinitely closer to each other,
p22
aVa reality where people, not devices,
p23
aVare the center of everything.
p24
aa(lp25
VI dream of a reality where technology senses what we see, touch and feel;
p26
aVa reality where technology no longer gets in our way,
p27
aVbut instead embraces who we are.
p28
aVI dream of technology
p29
aVon a human path.
p30
aVWe have all experienced technology
p31
aVthat enables people to act more like people,
p32
aVproducts that enable natural interactions, voice controls or biometrics.
p33
aa(lp34
VThis is the next step in the evolution.
p35
aVThis is Microsoft HoloLens,
p36
aVthe first fully untethered holographic computer.
p37
aVDevices like this will bring 3D holographic content
p38
aVright into our world,
p39
aVenhancing the way we experience life
p40
aVbeyond our ordinary range of perceptions.
p41
aVNow, I'm not thinking about a distant future.
p42
aVI'm talking about today.
p43
aVWe are already seeing car companies like Volvo
p44
aVdesigning cars differently with HoloLens;
p45
aVuniversities like Case Western redefining the way medical students learn;
p46
aVand my personal favorite,
p47
aVNASA is using HoloLens to let scientists explore planets
p48
aVholographically.
p49
aa(lp50
VNow, this is important.
p51
aVBy bringing holograms into our world,
p52
aVI'm not just talking about a new device or a better computer.
p53
aVI'm talking about freeing ourselves from the 2D confines
p54
aVof traditional computing.
p55
aa(lp56
VPut it this way:
p57
aVtemporally adjusted, we're like cave people in computer terms.
p58
aVWe've barely discovered charcoal
p59
aVand started drawing the first stick figures in our cave.
p60
aVNow, this is the perspective I apply to my work every single day.
p61
aVAnd now for the next few minutes,
p62
aVI invite all of you to apply the same perspective
p63
aVto the journey ahead of us.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow, as I put this HoloLens on,
p66
aVlet me explain the setup a little bit.
p67
aVIt's probably the most risky demo we have ever done on any stage
p68
aVwith HoloLens,
p69
aVand I can't think of a better place to do it than here at TED.
p70
aVMomentarily, I am going to be seeing holograms
p71
aVright on this stage,
p72
aVjust as clearly as I can see all of you.
p73
aVNow at the same time, we have also this special camera
p74
aVthat just walked in onstage
p75
aVso that all of you can share in this experience with me
p76
aVup on all the monitors.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo let's start our journey.
p79
aVAnd what better place to begin our journey,
p80
aVthan in the computer cave of 2D.
p81
aVLet's explore the world all around us with this new lens,
p82
aVand understand the computer world from a brand new perspective.
p83
aa(lp84
VThe computer universe is both marvelous and primitive.
p85
aVIt's a universe based on causality.
p86
aVAs developers, we dream the different causes
p87
aVand then we program the different effects.
p88
aVDouble click on an icon, that's a cause.
p89
aVOpen an application, that's an effect.
p90
aVNow when we compare this to our physical universe,
p91
aVit is overly constraining,
p92
aVbecause our universe is not digital.
p93
aVOur universe is analog.
p94
aVOur universe doesn't think in terms of zero or one,
p95
aVtrue or false, or black or white.
p96
aVWe exist in a world governed by quantum physics,
p97
aVa universe of zero and one both at the same time,
p98
aVa reality based on infinite probabilities and shades of gray.
p99
aVYou can see how these two worlds collide.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo why are screens so pervasive in our analog life?
p102
aVWe see screens from the moment we wake up,
p103
aVto the moment we fall asleep.
p104
aVWhy?
p105
aa(lp106
VI think it's because computers give us superpowers.
p107
aVWithin the digital universe, we have the power to displace space
p108
aVand the power to displace time.
p109
aVIt doesn't matter if you're using technology for entertainment,
p110
aVproductivity or communication.
p111
aVThink of it this way:
p112
aVlet's all go home tonight
p113
aVand watch our favorite show on television.
p114
aVThis is theater \u2014 time and space displaced.
p115
aVAs soon as I'm done with this TED Talk,
p116
aVI'm going to immediately call my lovely family in Seattle.
p117
aVThat's displacement of space.
p118
aVNow, these are such great superpowers
p119
aVthat we put up with the two-dimensional limitations
p120
aVof our current digital world.
p121
aVBut what if we didn't have to?
p122
aVWhat if we could have these same digital powers
p123
aVin our world?
p124
aVYou can already see glimmers of this,
p125
aVbut I believe our children's children
p126
aVwill grow up in a world devoid of 2D technology.
p127
aVIt's remarkable to dream of this world,
p128
aVa world where technology truly understands us \u2014
p129
aVwhere we live, work and communicate \u2014
p130
aVwith tools that enhance the human experience,
p131
aVnot machines that limit our humanity.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo how do we get there?
p134
aVFor me, the answer required looking at the problem
p135
aVfrom a different perspective.
p136
aVIt required sensing the world from the perspective of a machine.
p137
aVIf you're a machine trying to sense our world,
p138
aVhow would you actually break the problem down?
p139
aVYou'd probably try to classify things
p140
aVas a human,
p141
aVan environment
p142
aVor an object.
p143
aVBut how would that machine then interact with reality?
p144
aVAnd I can think of three ways.
p145
aa(lp146
VFirst, as a machine,
p147
aVI would observe or I would input reality.
p148
aVSpeech recognition and biometric authentication
p149
aVare great examples of a machine interacting with humans
p150
aVfrom an input perspective.
p151
aVSecondly, as a machine,
p152
aVI could place digital information, or output information,
p153
aVinto reality.
p154
aVHolograms are examples of a machine interacting with an environment
p155
aVfrom an output perspective.
p156
aVFinally, as a machine,
p157
aVI could exchange energy with the world via haptics.
p158
aVNow, imagine being able to feel the temperature of a virtual object,
p159
aVor better yet, imagine pushing a hologram
p160
aVand having it push you back with equal force.
p161
aa(lp162
VWith this perspective,
p163
aVwe are able to collapse reality into a simple matrix.
p164
aVNow here's a secret:
p165
aVas an engineer, I get really excited
p166
aVanytime I can reduce something to the matrix.
p167
aVFrom self-driving cars
p168
aVto smartphones
p169
aVto this holographic computer on my head,
p170
aVmachines are becoming capable of understanding our world.
p171
aVAnd they are starting to interact with us
p172
aVin significantly more personal ways.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow, imagine having granular control
p175
aVover everything in the world.
p176
aVMove the dial one way,
p177
aVand you get reality.
p178
aVMove the dial the other way,
p179
aVand you get virtual reality.
p180
aVNow, imagine dialing your entire environment
p181
aVbetween virtual and real worlds.
p182
aVI love it down here.
p183
aVNow, imagine if I could look at all of you
p184
aVand dial from real humans into elves.
p185
aVWhen technology truly understands our world,
p186
aVit will again transform the ways we interact,
p187
aVthe ways we work and the ways we play.
p188
aa(lp189
VLess than half a century ago,
p190
aVtwo courageous men landed on the moon,
p191
aVusing computers that were less powerful than the phones in your pockets.
p192
aVSix hundred million humans watched them
p193
aVon grainy, black-and-white televisions.
p194
aVAnd the world?
p195
aVThe world was mesmerized.
p196
aa(lp197
VNow imagine how our children and their children
p198
aVwill experience the continued exploration of space
p199
aVwith technology that understands this world.
p200
aVWe already live in a world where real-time universal translators exist.
p201
aVAnd I can squint, and I can already see holographic telepresence
p202
aVin our near future.
p203
aVIn fact, since we've been lucky with our demo so far,
p204
aVlet's try doing something else even more crazy.
p205
aVI invite you to experience,
p206
aVfor the first time anywhere in the world,
p207
aVhere on the TED stage,
p208
aVa real-life holographic teleportation,
p209
aVbetween me and my friend, Dr. Jeffrey Norris,
p210
aVfrom NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
p211
aa(lp212
VFinger crossed. Hi, Jeff.
p213
aa(lp214
VJeff Norris: Hey, Alex.
p215
aa(lp216
VAlex Kipman: Phew! That worked. How are you doing today, Jeff?
p217
aa(lp218
V(Applause)
p219
aa(lp220
VJN: Doing great. I had an awesome week.
p221
aa(lp222
VAK: So, can you tell us a little bit, Jeff, about where you are?
p223
aa(lp224
VJN: Well, I'm actually in three places.
p225
aVI'm standing in a room across the street,
p226
aVwhile I'm standing on this stage with you,
p227
aVwhile I'm standing on Mars, a hundred million miles away.
p228
aa(lp229
VAK: Wow, a hundred million miles away. This is crazy!
p230
aVCan you tell us a little bit more about where all this data
p231
aVfrom Mars is coming from?
p232
aa(lp233
VJN: Absolutely.
p234
aVThis is a precise holographic replica of Mars,
p235
aVbuilt from data captured by the Curiosity Mars Rover,
p236
aVthat I can explore as easily as a place on Earth.
p237
aVHumans are natural explorers.
p238
aVWe can instantly understand an environment,
p239
aVjust by being present in it.
p240
aVWe've built tools like our Mars Rover
p241
aVto extend our vision and lengthen our reach.
p242
aVBut for decades,
p243
aVwe've explored from a seat behind screens and keyboards.
p244
aVNow, we're leaping over all of that,
p245
aVover the giant antennas and the relay satellites
p246
aVand the vastness between worlds
p247
aVto take our first steps on this landscape as if we were truly there.
p248
aVToday, a group of scientists on our mission
p249
aVare seeing Mars as never before \u2014
p250
aVan alien world made a little more familiar,
p251
aVbecause they're finally exploring it as humans should.
p252
aa(lp253
VBut our dreams don't have to end with making it just like being there.
p254
aVWhen we dial this real world to the virtual,
p255
aVwe can do magical things.
p256
aVWe can see in invisible wavelengths
p257
aVor teleport to the top of a mountain.
p258
aVPerhaps someday, we'll feel the minerals in a rock just by touching it.
p259
aVWe're taking the first steps.
p260
aVBut we want the whole world to join us in taking the next,
p261
aVbecause this is not a journey for a few,
p262
aVbut for all of us.
p263
aa(lp264
VAK: Thank you Jeff, this was amazing.
p265
aVThank you so much for joining us on the TED stage today.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Applause)
p268
aa(lp269
VJN: Thank you Alex, bye bye.
p270
aa(lp271
VAK: Bye, Jeff.
p272
aa(lp273
V(Applause)
p274
aa(lp275
VI dream about this future
p276
aVevery single day.
p277
aVI take inspiration from our ancestors.
p278
aVWe used to live in tribes where we interacted,
p279
aVcommunicated and worked together.
p280
aVWe are all beginning to build technology that will enable us to return
p281
aVto the humanity that brought us where we are today \u2014
p282
aVtechnology that will let us stop living inside this 2D world
p283
aVof monitors and pixels,
p284
aVand let us start remembering what it feels like
p285
aVto live in our 3D world.
p286
aVIt's a phenomenal time to be human.
p287
aa(lp288
VThank you.
p289
aa(lp290
V(Applause)
p291
aa(lp292
VHelen Walters: Thanks so much. I have some questions.
p293
aa(lp294
VAK: OK.
p295
aa(lp296
VHW: So there's been some talk in the press.
p297
aVAnd I'll just ask you straight, then we have a straight answer.
p298
aVThere's been talk about the difference between the demos
p299
aVand the reality of the commercial product.
p300
aVTalk about this field of view issue.
p301
aVIs this type of experience what someone who buys the product will get?
p302
aa(lp303
VAK: It's a great question,
p304
aVOr, said better, this is a question we've been receiving
p305
aVin the media for possibly the last year.
p306
aVIf you do your research, I haven't answered that question.
p307
aVI've purposely ignored it,
p308
aVbecause ultimately, it's the wrong question to ask.
p309
aVThat's the equivalent of me showing holograms to someone for the first time,
p310
aVand you then saying, "What's the size of your television?"
p311
aVThe field of view for the product is almost irrelevant.
p312
aVWhat we should be talking about is the density of lights,
p313
aVor radiance, that shows up.
p314
aVBetter said, what the angular resolution is of the things that you see.
p315
aVSo from that perspective, what you saw \u2014
p316
aVyou know, the camera is wearing a HoloLens.
p317
aVSo even if I wanted to cheat, I can't.
p318
aa(lp319
VHW: But the camera has a different lens on it than our eye. Right?
p320
aa(lp321
VAK: The camera has a fish-eye lens on it.
p322
aVIt's seeing a much wider view than the human eye is.
p323
aVSo if you think about the points of light that show up radially
p324
aVfrom the vision of the camera,
p325
aVwhich is the thing that matters:
p326
aVhow many points of light can I get in a given volume?
p327
aVThat's the same as I get on this HoloLens as I will on that one.
p328
aVNow, this camera sees a much wider view of the world, right?
p329
aa(lp330
VHW: Jesus Christ!
p331
aa(lp332
V(Laughter)
p333
aa(lp334
VAK: He did show up! I told you he'd show up.
p335
aVCome this way.
p336
aa(lp337
V(Laughter)
p338
aa(lp339
VHW: Oh, shit.
p340
aa(lp341
VAK: And there's holographic Jeff Norris.
p342
aa(lp343
VHW: I knew something was happening, but I really wasn't sure what.
p344
aa(lp345
VAK: So in short: to be super crisp,
p346
aVthe camera that you see on the screen has a wider field of view
p347
aVthan the human eye.
p348
aVBut the angular resolution of the holograms that you see,
p349
aVthe points of light per unit of area,
p350
aVare actually the same.
p351
aa(lp352
VHW: So you spent \u2014 Jeff, I'll get to you in a minute \u2014
p353
aVso you spent a lot of time mapping the stage \u2014
p354
aa(lp355
VAK: That's right.
p356
aa(lp357
VHW: So help me out here:
p358
aVif I buy a HoloLens and have it at home,
p359
aVI don't need to map my apartment, right?
p360
aa(lp361
VAK: The HoloLens maps in real time at about five frames per second,
p362
aVwith this technology that we call spatial mapping.
p363
aVSo in your home, as soon as you put it on,
p364
aVholograms will start showing up, and you'll start placing them
p365
aVand they'll start learning your home.
p366
aVIn a stage environment where we're trying to get something on my head
p367
aVto communicate with something over there
p368
aVwith all of the wireless connectivity that usually brings all conferences down,
p369
aVwe don't take the risk of trying to do this live.
p370
aVSo what we do is pre-map the stage at five frames per second
p371
aVwith the same spatial-mapping technology
p372
aVthat you'll use with the product at home,
p373
aVand then we store it,
p374
aVso that when there's shenanigans of wireless in an environment like this,
p375
aVbetween the camera's HoloLens and the one on my head,
p376
aVwe don't have things disappear.
p377
aVBecause ultimately, the holograms are coming from this HoloLens,
p378
aVand that one is just viewing the HoloLens.
p379
aVSo if I lose connectivity,
p380
aVyou would stop seeing beautiful things on the screen.
p381
aa(lp382
VHW: And it was beautiful.
p383
aVUm ... Jeff?
p384
aa(lp385
VJN: Yes?
p386
aa(lp387
VHW: Hi.
p388
aa(lp389
VAK: I'll take a step back.
p390
aa(lp391
VHW: So Jeff, you were on Mars,
p392
aVyou were here, you were in a room across the street.
p393
aVTell me more about the fact that, with holograms, you have sight
p394
aVbut you don't have touch, you don't have smell.
p395
aVIs this scientifically useful now?
p396
aVThat's my question for a hologram.
p397
aa(lp398
VJN: Thanks for the question.
p399
aVAbsolutely, I believe that these technologies
p400
aVare scientifically useful right now,
p401
aVand that's why we're using them in multiple parts of our work at NASA.
p402
aVSo we're using it to improve the ways that we explore Mars.
p403
aVWe're also using it for our astronauts on the space station.
p404
aVWe're even using it now to design
p405
aVthe next generation of our spacecraft.
p406
aa(lp407
VHW: Amazing. OK, Jeff, please go away. Thank you very much.
p408
aa(lp409
V(Laughter)
p410
aa(lp411
VAlex, really, that was amazing. Thank you so much.
p412
aa(lp413
VAK: Thank you.
p414
aa(lp415
