VI am the daughter of a forger,
p4
aVnot just any forger ...
p5
aVWhen you hear the word "forger," you often understand "mercenary."
p6
aVYou understand "forged currency," "forged pictures."
p7
aVMy father is no such man.
p8
aVFor 30 years of his life,
p9
aVhe made false papers \u2014
p10
aVnever for himself, always for other people,
p11
aVand to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed.
p12
aVLet me introduce him.
p13
aVHere is my father at age 19.
p14
aVIt all began for him during World War II,
p15
aVwhen at age 17 he found himself thrust
p16
aVinto a forged documents workshop.
p17
aVHe quickly became the false papers expert of the Resistance.
p18
aVAnd it's not a banal story \u2014
p19
aVafter the liberation he continued
p20
aVto make false papers until the '70s.
p21
aa(lp22
VWhen I was a child
p23
aVI knew nothing about this, of course.
p24
aVThis is me in the middle making faces.
p25
aVI grew up in the Paris suburbs
p26
aVand I was the youngest of three children.
p27
aVI had a "normal" dad like everybody else,
p28
aVapart from the fact that he was 30 years older than ...
p29
aVwell, he was basically old enough to be my grandfather.
p30
aVAnyway, he was a photographer and a street educator,
p31
aVand he always taught us to obey the law very strictly.
p32
aVAnd, of course, he never talked about his past life
p33
aVwhen he was a forger.
p34
aa(lp35
VThere was, however, an incident I'm going to tell you about,
p36
aVthat perhaps could have led me suspect something.
p37
aVI was in high school and got a bad grade,
p38
aVa rare event for me,
p39
aVso I decided to hide it from my parents.
p40
aVIn order to do that, I set out to forge their signature.
p41
aVI started working on my mother's signature,
p42
aVbecause my father's is absolutely impossible to forge.
p43
aVSo, I got working. I took some sheets of paper
p44
aVand started practicing, practicing, practicing,
p45
aVuntil I reached what I thought was a steady hand,
p46
aVand went into action.
p47
aVLater, while checking my school bag,
p48
aVmy mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged.
p49
aVShe yelled at me like she never had before.
p50
aVI went to hide in my bedroom, under the blankets,
p51
aVand then I waited for my father to come back from work
p52
aVwith, one could say, much apprehension.
p53
aVI heard him come in.
p54
aVI remained under the blankets. He entered my room,
p55
aVsat on the corner of the bed,
p56
aVand he was silent, so I pulled the blanket from my head,
p57
aVand when he saw me he started laughing.
p58
aVHe was laughing so hard, he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand.
p59
aVThen he said, "But really, Sarah, you could have worked harder! Can't you see it's really too small?"
p60
aVIndeed, it's rather small.
p61
aa(lp62
VI was born in Algeria.
p63
aVThere I would hear people say my father was a "moudjahid"
p64
aVand that means "fighter."
p65
aVLater on, in France, I loved eavesdropping on grownups' conversations,
p66
aVand I would hear all sorts of stories about my father's previous life,
p67
aVespecially that he had "done" World War II,
p68
aVthat he had "done" the Algerian war.
p69
aVAnd in my head I would be thinking that "doing" a war meant being a soldier.
p70
aVBut knowing my father, and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent,
p71
aVI found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun.
p72
aVAnd indeed, I was very far from the mark.
p73
aa(lp74
VOne day, while my father was working on a file
p75
aVfor us to obtain French nationality,
p76
aVI happened to see some documents
p77
aVthat caught my attention.
p78
aVThese are real!
p79
aVThese are mine, I was born an Argentinean.
p80
aVBut the document I happened to see
p81
aVthat would help us build a case for the authorities
p82
aVwas a document from the army
p83
aVthat thanked my father for his work
p84
aVon behalf of the secret services.
p85
aVAnd then, suddenly, I went "wow!"
p86
aVMy father, a secret agent?
p87
aVIt was very James Bond.
p88
aVI wanted to ask him questions, which he didn't answer.
p89
aVAnd later, I told myself that
p90
aVone day I would have to question him.
p91
aVAnd then I became a mother and had a son,
p92
aVand finally decided it was time \u2014 that he absolutely had to talk to us.
p93
aVI had become a mother
p94
aVand he was celebrating his 77th birthday,
p95
aVand suddenly I was very, very afraid.
p96
aVI feared he'd go
p97
aVand take his silences with him,
p98
aVand take his secrets with him.
p99
aVI managed to convince him that it was important for us,
p100
aVbut possibly also for other people
p101
aVthat he shared his story.
p102
aVHe decided to tell it to me
p103
aVand I made a book,
p104
aVfrom which I'm going to read you some excerpts later.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo, his story. My father was born in Argentina.
p107
aVHis parents were of Russian descent.
p108
aVThe whole family came to settle in France in the '30s.
p109
aVHis parents were Jewish, Russian and above all, very poor.
p110
aVSo at the age of 14 my father had to work.
p111
aVAnd with his only diploma,
p112
aVhis primary education certificate,
p113
aVhe found himself working at a dyer - dry cleaner.
p114
aVThat's where he discovered something totally magical,
p115
aVand when he talks about it, it's fascinating \u2014
p116
aVit's the magic of dyeing chemistry.
p117
aVDuring that time the war was happening
p118
aVand his mother was killed when he was 15.
p119
aVThis coincided with the time when
p120
aVhe threw himself body and soul into chemistry
p121
aVbecause it was the only consolation for his sadness.
p122
aVAll day he would ask many questions to his boss
p123
aVto learn, to accumulate more and more knowledge,
p124
aVand at night, when no one was looking,
p125
aVhe'd put his experience to practice.
p126
aVHe was mostly interested in ink bleaching.
p127
aa(lp128
VAll this to tell you
p129
aVthat if my father became a forger, actually,
p130
aVit was almost by accident.
p131
aVHis family was Jewish, so they were hounded.
p132
aVFinally they were all arrested and taken to the Drancy camp
p133
aVand they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their Argentinean papers.
p134
aVWell, they were out,
p135
aVbut they were always in danger. The big "Jew" stamp was still on their papers.
p136
aVIt was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents.
p137
aVMy father had been instilled with such respect for the law
p138
aVthat although he was being persecuted,
p139
aVhe'd never thought of false papers.
p140
aVBut it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance.
p141
aa(lp142
VIn those times documents had hard covers,
p143
aVthey were filled in by hand,
p144
aVand they stated your job.
p145
aVIn order to survive, he needed
p146
aVto be working. He asked the man
p147
aVto write "dyer."
p148
aVSuddenly the man looked very, very interested.
p149
aVAs a "dyer," do you know how to bleach ink marks?
p150
aVOf course he knew.
p151
aVAnd suddenly the man started explaining that
p152
aVactually the whole Resistance had a huge problem:
p153
aVeven the top experts
p154
aVcould not manage to bleach an ink, called "indelible,"
p155
aVthe "Waterman" blue ink.
p156
aVAnd my father immediately replied that he knew exactly
p157
aVhow to bleach it.
p158
aVNow, of course, the man was very impressed with this young man of 17
p159
aVwho could immediately give him the formula, so he recruited him.
p160
aVAnd actually, without knowing it, my father had invented something
p161
aVwe can find in every schoolchild's pencil case:
p162
aVthe so-called "correction pen."
p163
aV(Applause)
p164
aa(lp165
VBut it was only the beginning.
p166
aVThat's my father.
p167
aVAs soon as he got to the lab,
p168
aVeven though he was the youngest,
p169
aVhe immediately saw that there was a problem with the making of forged documents.
p170
aVAll the movements stopped at falsifying.
p171
aVBut demand was ever-growing
p172
aVand it was difficult to tamper with existing documents.
p173
aVHe told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch.
p174
aVHe started a press. He started photoengraving.
p175
aVHe started making rubber stamps.
p176
aVHe started inventing all kind of things \u2014
p177
aVwith some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel.
p178
aVAnyway, he had to do all this
p179
aVbecause he was completely obsessed with output.
p180
aVHe had made a simple calculation:
p181
aVIn one hour he could make 30 forged documents.
p182
aVIf he slept one hour, 30 people would die.
p183
aa(lp184
VThis sense of
p185
aVresponsibility for other people's lives when he was just 17 \u2014
p186
aVand also his guilt for being a survivor,
p187
aVsince he had escaped the camp when his friends had not \u2014
p188
aVstayed with him all his life.
p189
aVAnd this is maybe what explains why, for 30 years,
p190
aVhe continued to make false papers
p191
aVat the expense of all kinds of sacrifices.
p192
aVI'd like to talk about those sacrifices,
p193
aVbecause there were many.
p194
aVThere were obviously financial sacrifices
p195
aVbecause he always refused to be paid.
p196
aVTo him, being paid would have meant being a mercenary.
p197
aVIf he had accepted payment,
p198
aVhe wouldn't be able to say "yes" or "no"
p199
aVdepending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause.
p200
aVSo he was a photographer by day,
p201
aVand a forger by night for 30 years.
p202
aVHe was broke all of the time.
p203
aa(lp204
VThen there were the emotional sacrifices:
p205
aVHow can one live with a woman while having so many secrets?
p206
aVHow can one explain what one does at night in the lab, every single night?
p207
aVOf course, there was another kind of sacrifice
p208
aVinvolving his family that I understood much later.
p209
aVOne day my father introduced me to my sister.
p210
aVHe also explained to me that I had a brother, too,
p211
aVand the first time I saw them I must have been three or four,
p212
aVand they were 30 years older than me.
p213
aVThey are both in their sixties now.
p214
aa(lp215
VIn order to write the book,
p216
aVI asked my sister questions. I wanted to know who my father was,
p217
aVwho was the father she had known.
p218
aVShe explained that the father that she'd had
p219
aVwould tell them he'd come and pick them up on Sunday to go for a walk.
p220
aVThey would get all dressed up and wait for him,
p221
aVbut he would almost never come.
p222
aVHe'd say, "I'll call." He wouldn't call.
p223
aVAnd then he would not come.
p224
aVThen one day he totally disappeared.
p225
aVTime passed,
p226
aVand they thought he had surely forgotten them,
p227
aVat first.
p228
aVThen as time passed,
p229
aVat the end of almost two years, they thought,
p230
aV"Well, perhaps our father has died."
p231
aVAnd then I understood
p232
aVthat asking my father so many questions
p233
aVwas stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking about
p234
aVbecause it was painful.
p235
aVAnd while my half brother and sister thought they'd been abandoned,
p236
aVorphaned,
p237
aVmy father was making false papers.
p238
aVAnd if he did not tell them, it was of course to protect them.
p239
aa(lp240
VAfter the liberation he made false papers
p241
aVto allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestine
p242
aVbefore the creation of Israel.
p243
aVAnd then, as he was a staunch anti-colonialist,
p244
aVhe made false papers for Algerians during the Algerian war.
p245
aVAfter the Algerian war,
p246
aVat the heart of the international resistance movements,
p247
aVhis name circulated
p248
aVand the whole world came knocking at his door.
p249
aVIn Africa there were countries fighting for their independence:
p250
aVGuinea, Guinea-Bissau, Angola.
p251
aVAnd then my father connected with Nelson Mandela's anti-apartheid party.
p252
aVHe made false papers for persecuted black South Africans.
p253
aa(lp254
VThere was also Latin America.
p255
aVMy father helped those who resisted dictatorships
p256
aVin the Dominican Republic, Haiti,
p257
aVand then it was the turn of Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, El Salvador, Nicaragua,
p258
aVColombia, Peru, Uruguay, Chile and Mexico.
p259
aVThen there was the Vietnam War.
p260
aVMy father made false papers for the American deserters
p261
aVwho did not wish to take up arms against the Vietnamese.
p262
aVEurope was not spared either.
p263
aVMy father made false papers for the dissidents
p264
aVagainst Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal,
p265
aVagainst the colonels' dictatorship in Greece,
p266
aVand even in France.
p267
aVThere, just once, it happened in May of 1968.
p268
aVMy father watched, benevolently, of course,
p269
aVthe demonstrations of the month of May,
p270
aVbut his heart was elsewhere, and so was his time
p271
aVbecause he had over 15 countries to serve.
p272
aa(lp273
VOnce, though, he agreed to make false papers
p274
aVfor someone you might recognize.
p275
aV(Laughter)
p276
aVHe was much younger in those days,
p277
aVand my father agreed to make false papers
p278
aVto enable him to come back and speak at a meeting.
p279
aVHe told me that those false papers were the most media-relevant
p280
aVand the least useful he'd had to make in all his life.
p281
aVBut, he agreed to do it,
p282
aVeven though Daniel Cohn-Bendit's life was not in danger,
p283
aVjust because
p284
aVit was a good opportunity
p285
aVto mock the authorities,
p286
aVand to show them that there's nothing more porous than borders \u2014
p287
aVand that ideas have no borders.
p288
aa(lp289
VAll my childhood,
p290
aVwhile my friends' dads would tell them Grimm's fairy tales,
p291
aVmy father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroes
p292
aVwith unshakeable utopias
p293
aVwho managed to make miracles.
p294
aVAnd those heroes did not need an army behind them.
p295
aVAnyhow, nobody would have followed them,
p296
aVexcept for a handful [of] men and women of conviction and courage.
p297
aVI understood much later
p298
aVthat actually it was his own story my father would tell me to get me to sleep.
p299
aVI asked him whether, considering the sacrifices he had to make,
p300
aVhe ever had any regrets.
p301
aVHe said no.
p302
aVHe told me that he would have been unable
p303
aVto witness or submit to injustice without doing anything.
p304
aVHe was persuaded, and he's still convinced
p305
aVthat another world is possible \u2014
p306
aVa world where no one would ever need a forger.
p307
aVHe's still dreaming about it.
p308
aVMy father
p309
aVis here in the room today.
p310
aVHis name is Adolfo Kaminsky and I'm going to ask him to stand up.
p311
aV(Applause)
p312
aVThank you.
