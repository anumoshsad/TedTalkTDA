VWhen you think about resilience and technology it's actually much easier.
p4
aVYou're going to see some other speakers today, I already know,
p5
aVwho are going to talk about breaking-bones stuff,
p6
aVand, of course, with technology it never is.
p7
aVSo it's very easy, comparatively speaking, to be resilient.
p8
aVI think that, if we look at what happened on the Internet,
p9
aVwith such an incredible last half a dozen years,
p10
aVthat it's hard to even get the right analogy for it.
p11
aVA lot of how we decide, how we're supposed to react to things
p12
aVand what we're supposed to expect about the future
p13
aVdepends on how we bucket things
p14
aVand how we categorize them.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd so I think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust
p17
aVthat we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush.
p18
aVIt's easy to think of this analogy as very different
p19
aVfrom some of the other things you might pick.
p20
aVFor one thing, both were very real.
p21
aVIn 1849, in that Gold Rush, they took over $700 million
p22
aVworth of gold out of California. It was very real.
p23
aVThe Internet was also very real. This is a real way for humans to
p24
aVcommunicate with each other. It's a big deal.
p25
aVHuge boom. Huge boom. Huge bust. Huge bust.
p26
aVYou keep going, and both things are lots of hype.
p27
aVI don't have to remind you of all the hype
p28
aVthat was involved with the Internet \u2014 like GetRich.com.
p29
aa(lp30
VBut you had the same thing with the Gold Rush. "Gold. Gold. Gold."
p31
aVSixty-eight rich men on the Steamer Portland. Stacks of yellow metal.
p32
aVSome have 5,000. Many have more.
p33
aVA few bring out 100,000 dollars each.
p34
aVPeople would get very excited about this when they read these articles.
p35
aV"The Eldorado of the United States of America:
p36
aVthe discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in California."
p37
aVAnd the parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly.
p38
aVSo many people left what they were doing.
p39
aVAnd what would happen is \u2014 and the Gold Rush went on for years.
p40
aa(lp41
VPeople on the East Coast in 1849, when they first started to get the news,
p42
aVthey thought, "Ah, this isn't real."
p43
aVBut they keep hearing about people getting rich,
p44
aVand then in 1850 they still hear that. And they think it's not real.
p45
aVBy about 1852, they're thinking, "Am I the stupidest person on Earth
p46
aVby not rushing to California?" And they start to decide they are.
p47
aVThese are community affairs, by the way.
p48
aVLocal communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams
p49
aVof 10, 20 people would caravan across the United States,
p50
aVand they would form companies.
p51
aVThese were typically not solitary efforts. But no matter what,
p52
aVif you were a lawyer or a banker, people dropped what they were doing,
p53
aVno matter what skill set they had, to go pan for gold.
p54
aa(lp55
VThis guy on the left, Dr. Richard Beverley Cole,
p56
aVhe lived in Philadelphia and he took the Panama route.
p57
aVThey would take a ship down to Panama, across the isthmus,
p58
aVand then take another ship north.
p59
aVThis guy, Dr. Toland, went by covered wagon to California.
p60
aVThis has its parallels, too. Doctors leaving their practices.
p61
aVThese are both very successful \u2014 a physician in one case,
p62
aVa surgeon in the other.
p63
aVSame thing happened on the Internet. You get DrKoop.com.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VIn the Gold Rush, people literally jumped ship.
p68
aVThe San Francisco harbor was clogged with 600 ships at the peak
p69
aVbecause the ships would get there and the crews would abandon
p70
aVto go search for gold.
p71
aVSo there were literally 600 captains and 600 ships.
p72
aVThey turned the ships into hotels, because they couldn't sail them anywhere.
p73
aVYou had dotcom fever. And you had gold fever.
p74
aVAnd you saw some of the excesses
p75
aVthat the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened.
p76
aVThe fort in San Francisco at the time had about 1,300 soldiers.
p77
aVHalf of them deserted to go look for gold.
p78
aVAnd they wouldn't let the other half out to go look for the first half
p79
aVbecause they were afraid they wouldn't come back.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd one of the soldiers wrote home, and this is the sentence that he put:
p84
aV"The struggle between right and six dollars a month
p85
aVand wrong and 75 dollars a day is a rather severe one."
p86
aVThey had bad burn rate in the Gold Rush. A very bad burn rate.
p87
aVThis is actually from the Klondike Gold Rush. This is the White Pass Trail.
p88
aVThey loaded up their mules and their horses.
p89
aVAnd they didn't plan right.
p90
aVAnd they didn't know how far they would really have to go,
p91
aVand they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff.
p92
aVIn fact it was so bad that most of the horses died
p93
aVbefore they could get where they were going.
p94
aVIt got renamed the "Dead Horse Trail."
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd the Canadian Minister of the Interior wrote this at the time:
p97
aV"Thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way,
p98
aVsometimes in bunches under the cliffs,
p99
aVwith pack saddles and packs where they've fallen from the rock above,
p100
aVsometimes in tangled masses, filling the mud holes
p101
aVand furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march,
p102
aVoften, I regret to say, exhausted, but still alive,
p103
aVa fact we were unaware of, until after the miserable wretches
p104
aVturned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade.
p105
aVThe eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere
p106
aVaccount for the myriads of ravens along the road.
p107
aVThe inhumanity which this trail has been witness to,
p108
aVthe heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone,
p109
aVcannot be imagined. They certainly cannot be described."
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd you know, without the smell that would have accompanied that,
p112
aVwe had the same thing on the Internet: very bad burn rate calculations.
p113
aVI'll just play one of these and you'll remember it.
p114
aVThis is a commercial that was played on the Super Bowl in the year 2000.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Video): Bride #1: You said you had a large selection of invitations. Clerk: But we do.
p117
aVBride #2: Then why does she have my invitation?
p118
aVAnnouncer: What may be a little thing to some ... Bride #3: You are mine, little man.
p119
aVAnnouncer: Could be a really big deal to you. Husband #1: Is that your wife?
p120
aVHusband #2: Not for another 15 minutes. Announcer: After all, it's your special day.
p121
aVOurBeginning.com. Life's an event. Announce it to the world.
p122
aa(lp123
VJeff Bezos: It's very difficult to figure out what that ad is for.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VBut they spent three and a half million dollars
p128
aVin the 2000 Super Bowl to air that ad,
p129
aVeven though, at the time, they only had a million dollars in annual revenue.
p130
aVNow, here's where our analogy with the Gold Rush starts to diverge,
p131
aVand I think rather severely.
p132
aVAnd that is, in a gold rush, when it's over, it's over.
p133
aVHere's this guy: "There are many men in Dawson
p134
aVat the present time who feel keenly disappointed.
p135
aVThey've come thousands of miles on a perilous trip, risked life, health and property,
p136
aVspent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform
p137
aVand at length with expectations raised to the highest pitch
p138
aVhave reached the coveted goal only to discover
p139
aVthe fact that there is nothing here for them."
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd that was, of course, the very common story.
p142
aVBecause when you take out that last piece of gold \u2014
p143
aVand they did incredibly quickly. I mean, if you look at the 1849 Gold Rush \u2014
p144
aVthe entire American river region, within two years \u2014
p145
aVevery stone had been turned. And after that, only big companies
p146
aVwho used more sophisticated mining technologies
p147
aVstarted to take gold out of there.
p148
aVSo there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic
p149
aVand that analogy is the electric industry.
p150
aVAnd there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry.
p151
aVWith the electric industry you actually have to \u2014
p152
aVone of them is that they're both sort of thin,
p153
aVhorizontal, enabling layers that go across lots of different industries.
p154
aVIt's not a specific thing.
p155
aa(lp156
VBut electricity is also very, very broad, so you have to sort of narrow it down.
p157
aVYou know, it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power.
p158
aVIt's an incredible means of coordinating,
p159
aVin a very fine-grained way, information flows.
p160
aVThere's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity.
p161
aVAnd the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on
p162
aVis sort of the golden age of appliances.
p163
aVThe killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb.
p164
aVSo the light bulb is what wired the world.
p165
aVAnd they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world.
p166
aVThey were really thinking about \u2014
p167
aVthey weren't putting electricity into the home;
p168
aVthey were putting lighting into the home.
p169
aVAnd, but it really \u2014 it got the electricity. It took a long time.
p170
aa(lp171
VThis was a huge \u2014 as you would expect \u2014 a huge capital build out.
p172
aVAll the streets had to be torn up.
p173
aVThis is work going on down in lower Manhattan
p174
aVwhere they built some of the first electric power generating stations.
p175
aVAnd they're tearing up all the streets.
p176
aVThe Edison Electric Company, which became Edison General Electric,
p177
aVwhich became General Electric,
p178
aVpaid for all of this digging up of the streets. It was incredibly expensive.
p179
aVBut that is not the \u2014 and that's not the part that's really most similar to the Web.
p180
aVBecause, remember, the Web got to stand
p181
aVon top of all this heavy infrastructure
p182
aVthat had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network.
p183
aVSo all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure \u2014
p184
aVI'm going back now to, sort of, the explosive part of the Web in 1994,
p185
aVwhen it was growing 2,300 percent a year.
p186
aVHow could it grow at 2,300 percent a year in 1994
p187
aVwhen people weren't really investing in the Web?
p188
aVWell, it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure,
p191
aVand then home appliances started coming into being.
p192
aVAnd this was huge. The first one was the electric fan \u2014
p193
aVthis was the 1890 electric fan.
p194
aVAnd the appliances, the golden age of appliances really lasted \u2014
p195
aVit depends how you want to measure it \u2014
p196
aVbut it's anywhere from 40 to 60 years. It goes on a long time.
p197
aVIt starts about 1890. And the electric fan was a big success.
p198
aVThe electric iron, also very big.
p199
aVBy the way, this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VThere's asbestos under that handle there.
p204
aVThis is the first vacuum cleaner, the 1905 Skinner Vacuum,
p205
aVfrom the Hoover Company. And this one weighed 92 pounds
p206
aVand took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car.
p207
aVSo it wasn't a big seller.
p208
aVThis was truly, truly an early-adopter product \u2014
p209
aV(Laughter)
p210
aVthe 1905 Skinner Vacuum.
p211
aVBut three years later, by 1908, it weighed 40 pounds.
p212
aVNow, not all these things were highly successful.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VThis is the electric tie press, which never really did catch on.
p217
aVPeople, I guess, decided that they would not wrinkle their ties.
p218
aVThese never really caught on either:
p219
aVthe electric shoe warmer and drier. Never a big seller.
p220
aVThis came in, like, six different colors.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VI don't know why. But I thought, you know,
p225
aVsometimes it's just not the right time for an invention;
p226
aVmaybe it's time to give this one another shot.
p227
aVSo I thought we could build a Super Bowl ad for this.
p228
aVWe'd need the right partner. And I thought that really \u2014
p229
aV(Laughter)
p230
aVI thought that would really work, to give that another shot.
p231
aVNow, the toaster was huge
p232
aVbecause they used to make toast on open fires,
p233
aVand it took a lot of time and attention.
p234
aVI want to point out one thing. This is \u2014 you guys know what this is.
p235
aVThey hadn't invented the electric socket yet.
p236
aVSo this was \u2014 remember, they didn't wire the houses for electricity.
p237
aVThey wired them for lighting. So your \u2014 your appliances would plug in.
p238
aVThey would \u2014 each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top.
p239
aVAnd you'd plug it in there.
p240
aa(lp241
VIn fact, if you've seen the Carousel of Progress at Disney World,
p242
aVyou've seen this. Here are the cables coming up into this light fixture.
p243
aVAll the appliances plug in there. And you would just unscrew your light bulb
p244
aVif you wanted to plug in an appliance.
p245
aVThe next thing that really was a big, big deal was the washing machine.
p246
aVNow, this was an object of much envy and lust.
p247
aVEverybody wanted one of these electric washing machines.
p248
aVOn the left-hand side, this was the soapy water.
p249
aVAnd there's a rotor there \u2014 that this motor is spinning.
p250
aVAnd it would clean your clothes.
p251
aVThis is the clean rinse-water. So you'd take the clothes out of here,
p252
aVput them in here, and then you'd run the clothes through this electric wringer.
p253
aVAnd this was a big deal.
p254
aVYou'd keep this on your porch. It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain.
p255
aVAnd you'd run a long cord into the house
p256
aVwhere you could screw it into your light socket.
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd that's actually kind of an important point in my presentation,
p261
aVbecause they hadn't invented the off switch.
p262
aVThat was to come much later \u2014 the off switch on appliances \u2014
p263
aVbecause it didn't make any sense.
p264
aVI mean, you didn't want this thing clogging up a light socket.
p265
aVSo you know, when you were done with it, you unscrewed it.
p266
aVThat's what you did. You didn't turn it off.
p267
aVAnd as I said before, they hadn't invented the electric outlet either,
p268
aVso the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device.
p269
aVAnd there are \u2014
p270
aVwhen you research this, there are gruesome descriptions
p271
aVof people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices.
p272
aVAnd they couldn't yank the cord out
p273
aVbecause it was screwed into a light socket inside the house.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aVAnd there was no off switch, so it wasn't very good.
p277
aVAnd you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors
p278
aVto be plugging things into a light socket like this.
p279
aVBut, you know, before I get too far into condemning our ancestors,
p280
aVI thought I'd show you: this is my conference room.
p281
aVThis is a total kludge, if you ask me.
p282
aVFirst of all, this got installed upside down. This light socket \u2014
p283
aV(Laughter)
p284
aVand so the cord keeps falling out, so I taped it in.
p285
aa(lp286
V(Laughter)
p287
aa(lp288
VThis is supposed \u2014 don't even get me started. But that's not the worst one.
p289
aVThis is what it looks like under my desk.
p290
aVI took this picture just two days ago.
p291
aVSo we really haven't progressed that much since 1908.
p292
aa(lp293
V(Laughter)
p294
aa(lp295
VIt's a total, total mess.
p296
aVAnd, you know, we think it's getting better,
p297
aVbut have you tried to install 802.11 yourself?
p298
aa(lp299
V(Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
VI challenge you to try. It's very hard.
p302
aVI know Ph.D.s in Computer Science \u2014
p303
aVthis process has brought them to tears, absolute tears. (Laughter)
p304
aVAnd that's assuming you already have DSL in your house.
p305
aVTry to get DSL installed in your house.
p306
aVThe engineers who do it everyday can't do it.
p307
aVThey have to \u2014 typically, they come three times.
p308
aVAnd one friend of mine was telling me a story:
p309
aVnot only did they get there and have to wait,
p310
aVbut then the engineers, when they finally did get there,
p311
aVfor the third time, they had to call somebody.
p312
aVAnd they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone
p313
aVbecause then they had to wait on hold for an hour
p314
aVto talk to somebody to give them an access code
p315
aVafter they got there.
p316
aVSo we're not \u2014 we're pretty kludge-y ourselves.
p317
aa(lp318
VBy the way, DSL is a kludge.
p319
aVI mean, this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed
p320
aVfor the purpose it's being put to \u2014
p321
aVyou know it's the whole thing \u2014
p322
aVwe're very, very primitive. And that's kind of the point.
p323
aVBecause, you know, resilience \u2014 if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush,
p324
aVthen you'd be pretty depressed right now
p325
aVbecause the last nugget of gold would be gone.
p326
aVBut the good thing is, with innovation, there isn't a last nugget.
p327
aVEvery new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities.
p328
aa(lp329
VAnd if you believe that, then you believe that where we are \u2014
p330
aVthis is what I think \u2014 I believe that where we are with the incredible kludge \u2014
p331
aVand I haven't even talked about user interfaces on the Web \u2014
p332
aVbut there's so much kludge, so much terrible stuff \u2014
p333
aVwe are at the 1908 Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet.
p334
aVThat's where we are. We don't get our hair caught in it,
p335
aVbut that's the level of primitiveness of where we are.
p336
aVWe're in 1908.
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd if you believe that, then stuff like this doesn't bother you. This is 1996:
p339
aV"All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble."
p340
aV1998: "Amazon.toast." In 1999: "Amazon.bomb."
p341
aVMy mom hates this picture.
p342
aa(lp343
V(Laughter)
p344
aa(lp345
VShe \u2014 but you know, if you really do believe that it's the very,
p346
aVvery beginning, if you believe it's the 1908 Hurley washing machine,
p347
aVthen you're incredibly optimistic. And I do think that that's where we are.
p348
aVAnd I do think there's more innovation ahead of us
p349
aVthan there is behind us.
p350
aVAnd in 1917, Sears \u2014 I want to get this exactly right.
p351
aVThis was the advertisement that they ran in 1917.
p352
aVIt says: "Use your electricity for more than light."
p353
aVAnd I think that's where we are.
p354
aVWe're very, very early. Thank you very much.
