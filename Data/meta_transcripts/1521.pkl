VI'm going to tell you about an affliction I suffer from.
p4
aVAnd I have a funny feeling that quite a few of you
p5
aVsuffer from it as well.
p6
aVWhen I'm walking around an art gallery,
p7
aVrooms and rooms full of paintings,
p8
aVafter about 15 or 20 minutes,
p9
aVI realize I'm not thinking about the paintings.
p10
aVI'm not connecting to them.
p11
aVInstead, I'm thinking about that cup of coffee
p12
aVI desperately need to wake me up.
p13
aVI'm suffering from gallery fatigue.
p14
aa(lp15
VHow many of you out there suffer from \u2014
p16
aVyes. Ha ha, ha ha!
p17
aVNow, sometimes you might last longer
p18
aVthan 20 minutes, or even shorter,
p19
aVbut I think we all suffer from it. And do you have
p20
aVthe accompanying guilt?
p21
aVFor me, I look at the paintings on the wall
p22
aVand I think, somebody has decided to put them there,
p23
aVthinks they're good enough to be on that wall,
p24
aVbut I don't always see it.
p25
aVIn fact, most of the time I don't see it.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd I leave feeling actually unhappy.
p28
aVI feel guilty and unhappy with myself,
p29
aVrather than thinking there's something wrong with the painting,
p30
aVI think there's something wrong with me.
p31
aVAnd that's not a good experience, to leave a gallery like that.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VThe thing is, I think we should give ourselves a break.
p36
aVIf you think about going into a restaurant,
p37
aVwhen you look at the menu, are you expected to order
p38
aVevery single thing on the menu?
p39
aVNo! You select.
p40
aVIf you go into a department store to buy a shirt,
p41
aVare you going to try on every single shirt
p42
aVand want every single shirt?
p43
aVOf course not, you can be selective. It's expected.
p44
aVHow come, then, it's not so expected
p45
aVto be selective when we go to an art gallery?
p46
aVWhy are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting?
p47
aa(lp48
VWell I'm trying to take a different approach.
p49
aVAnd there's two things I do:
p50
aVWhen I go into a gallery, first of all, I go quite fast,
p51
aVand I look at everything, and I pinpoint the ones
p52
aVthat make me slow down for some reason or other.
p53
aVI don't even know why they make me slow down, but something
p54
aVpulls me like a magnet
p55
aVand then I ignore all the others, and I just go to that painting.
p56
aVSo it's the first thing I do is, I do my own curation.
p57
aVI choose a painting. It might just be one painting in 50.
p58
aVAnd then the second thing I do is I stand in front of that painting,
p59
aVand I tell myself a story about it.
p60
aa(lp61
VWhy a story? Well, I think that we are wired,
p62
aVour DNA tells us to tell stories.
p63
aVWe tell stories all the time about everything,
p64
aVand I think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy, chaotic place,
p65
aVand sometimes stories, we're trying to make sense of the world a little bit,
p66
aVtrying to bring some order to it.
p67
aVWhy not apply that to our looking at paintings?
p68
aVSo I now have this sort of restaurant menu
p69
aVvisiting of art galleries.
p70
aa(lp71
VThere are three paintings I'm going to show you now
p72
aVthat are paintings that made me stop in my tracks
p73
aVand want to tell stories about them.
p74
aVThe first one needs little introduction \u2014
p75
aV"Girl with a Pearl Earring" by Johannes Vermeer,
p76
aV17th-century Dutch painter.
p77
aVThis is the most glorious painting.
p78
aVI first saw it when I was 19,
p79
aVand I immediately went out and got a poster of it,
p80
aVand in fact I still have that poster. 30 years later it's hanging in my house.
p81
aVIt's accompanied me everywhere I've gone,
p82
aVI never tire of looking at her.
p83
aa(lp84
VWhat made me stop in my tracks about her to begin with
p85
aVwas just the gorgeous colors he uses
p86
aVand the light falling on her face.
p87
aVBut I think what's kept me still coming back
p88
aVyear after year is another thing, and that is
p89
aVthe look on her face, the conflicted look on her face.
p90
aVI can't tell if she's happy or sad,
p91
aVand I change my mind all the time.
p92
aVSo that keeps me coming back.
p93
aa(lp94
VOne day, 16 years after I had this poster on my wall,
p95
aVI lay in bed and looked at her,
p96
aVand I suddenly thought, I wonder what
p97
aVthe painter did to her to make her look like that.
p98
aVAnd it was the first time I'd ever thought that
p99
aVthe expression on her face is actually reflecting
p100
aVhow she feels about him.
p101
aVAlways before I'd thought of it as a portrait of a girl.
p102
aVNow I began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship.
p103
aVAnd I thought, well, what is that relationship?
p104
aa(lp105
VSo I went to find out. I did some research and discovered,
p106
aVwe have no idea who she is.
p107
aVIn fact, we don't know who any of the models
p108
aVin any of Vermeer's paintings are,
p109
aVand we know very little about Vermeer himself.
p110
aVWhich made me go, "Yippee!"
p111
aVI can do whatever I want, I can come up with whatever story I want to.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo here's how I came up with the story.
p114
aVFirst of all, I thought,
p115
aVI've got to get her into the house.
p116
aVHow does Vermeer know her?
p117
aVWell, there've been suggestions that
p118
aVshe is his 12-year-old daughter.
p119
aVThe daughter at the time was 12 when he painted the painting.
p120
aVAnd I thought, no, it's a very intimate look,
p121
aVbut it's not a look a daughter gives her father.
p122
aVFor one thing, in Dutch painting of the time,
p123
aVif a woman's mouth was open, it was indicating sexual availability.
p124
aVIt would have been inappropriate for Vermeer
p125
aVto paint his daughter like that.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo it's not his daughter, but it's somebody
p128
aVclose to him, physically close to him.
p129
aVWell, who else would be in the house?
p130
aVA servant, a lovely servant.
p131
aVSo, she's in the house.
p132
aVHow do we get her into the studio?
p133
aVWe don't know very much about Vermeer,
p134
aVbut the little bits that we do know, one thing we know
p135
aVis that he married a Catholic woman, they lived with her mother
p136
aVin a house where he had his own room
p137
aVwhere he \u2014 his studio. He also had 11 children.
p138
aVIt would have been a chaotic, noisy household.
p139
aVAnd if you've seen Vermeer's paintings before,
p140
aVyou know that they're incredibly calm and quiet.
p141
aa(lp142
VHow does a painter paint such calm, quiet paintings with 11 kids around?
p143
aVWell, he compartmentalizes his life.
p144
aVHe gets to his studio, and he says, "Nobody comes in here.
p145
aVNot the wife, not the kids. Okay, the maid can come in and clean."
p146
aVShe's in the studio. He's got her in the studio, they're together.
p147
aVAnd he decides to paint her.
p148
aa(lp149
VHe has her wear very plain clothes.
p150
aVNow, all of the women, or most of the women in Vermeer's other paintings
p151
aVwore velvet, silk, fur, very sumptuous materials.
p152
aVThis is very plain; the only thing that isn't plain
p153
aVis her pearl earring.
p154
aVNow, if she's a servant, there is no way she could afford
p155
aVa pair of pearl earrings.
p156
aVSo those are not her pearl earrings. Whose are they?
p157
aVWe happen to know, there's a list of Catharina, the wife's clothes.
p158
aVAmongst them a yellow coat with white fur,
p159
aVa yellow and black bodice,
p160
aVand you see these clothes on lots of other paintings,
p161
aVdifferent women in the paintings, Vermeer's paintings.
p162
aVSo clearly, her clothes were lent to various different women.
p163
aVIt's not such a leap of faith to take
p164
aVthat that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo we've got all the elements for our story.
p167
aVShe's in the studio with him for a long time.
p168
aVThese paintings took a long time to make.
p169
aVThey would have spent the time alone, all that time.
p170
aVShe's wearing his wife's pearl earring.
p171
aVShe's gorgeous. She obviously loves him. She's conflicted.
p172
aVAnd does the wife know? Maybe not.
p173
aVAnd if she doesn't, well \u2014
p174
aVthat's the story.
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VThe next painting I'm going to talk about
p179
aVis called "Boy Building a House of Cards" by Chardin.
p180
aVHe's an 18th-century French painter best known for his still lifes,
p181
aVbut he did occasionally paint people.
p182
aVAnd in fact, he painted four versions of this painting,
p183
aVdifferent boys building houses of cards, all concentrated.
p184
aVI like this version the best, because some of the boys
p185
aVare older and some are younger, and to me, this one,
p186
aVlike Goldilocks's porridge, is just right.
p187
aa(lp188
VHe's not quite a child, and he's not quite a man.
p189
aVHe's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience,
p190
aVand that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting.
p191
aVAnd I looked at his face. It's like a Vermeer painting a bit.
p192
aVThe light comes in from the left, his face is bathed
p193
aVin this glowing light. It's right in the center of the painting,
p194
aVand you look at it, and I found that when I was looking at it,
p195
aVI was standing there going,
p196
aV"Look at me. Please look at me."
p197
aVAnd he didn't look at me. He was still looking at his cards,
p198
aVand that's one of the seductive elements of this painting is,
p199
aVhe's so focused on what he's doing that he doesn't look at us.
p200
aVAnd that is, to me, the sign of a masterpiece,
p201
aVof a painting when there's a lack of resolution.
p202
aVHe's never going to look at me.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo I was thinking of a story where,
p205
aVif I'm in this position, who could be there looking at him?
p206
aVNot the painter, I don't want to think about the painter.
p207
aVI'm thinking of an older version of himself.
p208
aVHe's a man, a servant, an older servant looking at this younger servant,
p209
aVsaying, "Look at me. I want to warn you about
p210
aVwhat you're about to go through. Please look at me."
p211
aVAnd he never does.
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd that lack of resolution, the lack of resolution in "Girl with a Pearl Earring" \u2014
p214
aVwe don't know if she's happy or sad.
p215
aVI've written an entire novel about her,
p216
aVand I still don't know if she's happy or sad.
p217
aVAgain and again, back to the painting,
p218
aVlooking for the answer, looking for the story to fill in that gap.
p219
aVAnd we may make a story, and it satisfies us momentarily,
p220
aVbut not really, and we come back again and again.
p221
aa(lp222
VThe last painting I'm going to talk about
p223
aVis called "Anonymous" by anonymous. (Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VThis is a Tudor portrait bought by the National Portrait Gallery.
p226
aVThey thought it was a man named Sir Thomas Overbury,
p227
aVand then they discovered that it wasn't him,
p228
aVand they have no idea who it is.
p229
aa(lp230
VNow, in the National Portrait Gallery,
p231
aVif you don't know the biography of the painting,
p232
aVit's kind of useless to you.
p233
aVThey can't hang it on the wall, because they don't know who he is.
p234
aVSo unfortunately, this orphan spends most of his time in storage,
p235
aValong with quite a number of other orphans,
p236
aVsome of them some beautiful paintings.
p237
aa(lp238
VThis painting made me stop in my tracks for three reasons:
p239
aVOne is the disconnection between his mouth
p240
aVthat's smiling and his eyes that are wistful.
p241
aVHe's not happy, and why isn't he happy?
p242
aVThe second thing that really attracted me
p243
aVwere his bright red cheeks.
p244
aVHe is blushing. He's blushing for his portrait being made!
p245
aVThis must be a guy who blushes all the time.
p246
aVWhat is he thinking about that's making him blush?
p247
aVThe third thing that made me stop in my tracks
p248
aVis his absolutely gorgeous doublet.
p249
aVSilk, gray, those beautiful buttons.
p250
aVAnd you know what it makes me think of,
p251
aVis it's sort of snug and puffy; it's like a duvet spread over a bed.
p252
aa(lp253
VI kept thinking of beds and red cheeks,
p254
aVand of course I kept thinking of sex when I looked at him,
p255
aVand I thought, is that what he's thinking about?
p256
aVAnd I thought, if I'm going to make a story,
p257
aVwhat's the last thing I'm going to put in there?
p258
aVWell, what would a Tudor gentleman be preoccupied with?
p259
aVAnd I thought, well, Henry VIII, okay.
p260
aVHe'd be preoccupied with his inheritance, with his heir.
p261
aVWho is going to inherit his name and his fortune?
p262
aVYou put all those together, and you've got your story
p263
aVto fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back.
p264
aVNow, here's the story.
p265
aVIt's short.
p266
aa(lp267
V"Rosy"
p268
aa(lp269
VI am still wearing the white brocade doublet Caroline gave me.
p270
aVIt has a plain high collar, detachable sleeves
p271
aVand intricate buttons of twisted silk thread,
p272
aVset close together so that the fit is snug.
p273
aVThe doublet makes me think of a coverlet on the vast bed.
p274
aVPerhaps that was the intention.
p275
aVI first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor.
p276
aVI knew even before I stood up to speak
p277
aVthat my cheeks were inflamed.
p278
aVI have always flushed easily, from physical exertion,
p279
aVfrom wine, from high emotion.
p280
aa(lp281
VAs a boy, I was teased by my sisters and by schoolboys,
p282
aVbut not by George.
p283
aVOnly George could call me Rosy.
p284
aVI would not allow anyone else.
p285
aVHe managed to make the word tender.
p286
aVWhen I made the announcement, George did not
p287
aVturn rosy, but went pale as my doublet.
p288
aVHe should not have been surprised.
p289
aVIt has been a common assumption
p290
aVthat I would one day marry his cousin.
p291
aVBut it is difficult to hear the words aloud.
p292
aVI know, I could barely utter them.
p293
aa(lp294
VAfterwards, I found George on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden.
p295
aVDespite drinking steadily all afternoon, he was still pale.
p296
aVWe stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces.
p297
aV"What do you think of my doublet?" I asked.
p298
aa(lp299
VHe glanced at me. "That collar looks to be strangling you."
p300
aa(lp301
V"We will still see each other," I insisted.
p302
aV"We can still hunt and play cards and attend court.
p303
aVNothing need change."
p304
aVGeorge did not speak.
p305
aV"I am 23 years old. It is time for me to marry
p306
aVand produce an heir. It is expected of me."
p307
aa(lp308
VGeorge drained another glass of claret and turned to me.
p309
aV"Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials, James.
p310
aVI'm sure you'll be content together."
p311
aVHe never used my nickname again.
p312
aa(lp313
VThank you.
p314
aa(lp315
V(Applause)
p316
aa(lp317
VThank you.
