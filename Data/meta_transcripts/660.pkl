VOver the next five minutes,
p4
aVmy intention is to transform your relationship with sound.
p5
aVLet me start with the observation
p6
aVthat most of the sound around us is accidental;
p7
aVmuch of it is unpleasant. (Traffic noise)
p8
aVWe stand on street corners, shouting over noise like this,
p9
aVpretending it doesn't exist.
p10
aVThis habit of suppressing sound has meant
p11
aVthat our relationship with sound has become largely unconscious.
p12
aa(lp13
VThere are four major ways sound is affecting you all the time,
p14
aVand I'd like to raise them in your consciousness today.
p15
aVThe first is physiological.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Alarm clocks ring)
p18
aa(lp19
VSorry about that.
p20
aVI just gave you a shot of cortisol, your fight-flight hormone.
p21
aVSounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time,
p22
aVbut also your breathing, heart rate \u2014 which I just also did \u2014
p23
aVand your brainwaves.
p24
aa(lp25
VIt's not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it.
p26
aVThis is surf. (Ocean waves)
p27
aVIt has the frequency of roughly 12 cycles per minute.
p28
aVMost people find that very soothing,
p29
aVand, interestingly, 12 cycles per minute is roughly the frequency
p30
aVof the breathing of a sleeping human,
p31
aVso there is a deep resonance with being at rest.
p32
aVWe also associate it with being stress-free and on holiday.
p33
aa(lp34
VThe second way in which sound affects you is psychological.
p35
aVMusic is the most powerful form of sound that we know
p36
aVthat affects our emotional state. (Albinoni's Adagio)
p37
aVThis is guaranteed to make most of you feel pretty sad if I leave it on.
p38
aVMusic is not the only kind of sound, however, which affects your emotions.
p39
aa(lp40
VNatural sound can do that, too.
p41
aVBirdsong, for example, is a sound which most people find reassuring.
p42
aVThere's a reason: over hundreds of thousands of years
p43
aVwe've learned that when the birds are singing, things are safe.
p44
aVIt's when they stop you need to be worried.
p45
aa(lp46
VThe third way in which sound affects you is cognitively.
p47
aVYou can't understand two people talking at once (Voice-over)
p48
aVor in this case, one person talking twice.
p49
aVYou have to choose which me you're going to listen to.
p50
aa(lp51
VWe have a very small amount of bandwidth for processing auditory input,
p52
aVwhich is why noise like this ...
p53
aa(lp54
V(Office noise)
p55
aa(lp56
Vis extremely damaging for productivity.
p57
aVIf you have to work in an open-plan office like this,
p58
aVyour productivity is greatly reduced.
p59
aVAnd whatever number you're thinking of, it probably isn't as bad as this.
p60
aa(lp61
V[Open-plan offices productivity down 66%]
p62
aa(lp63
VYou are one-third as productive in open-plan offices as in quiet rooms.
p64
aVI have a tip for you:
p65
aVif you work in spaces like that, carry headphones with you,
p66
aVwith a soothing sound like birdsong.
p67
aVPut them on, and your productivity goes back up to triple what it would be.
p68
aa(lp69
VThe fourth way in which sound affects us is behaviorally.
p70
aVWith all that other stuff going on,
p71
aVit would be amazing if our behavior didn't change.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Techno music)
p74
aa(lp75
VSo ask yourself: Is this person ever going to drive
p76
aVat a steady 28 miles per hour?
p77
aVI don't think so.
p78
aVAt the simplest, you move away from unpleasant sound
p79
aVand towards pleasant sounds.
p80
aVSo if I were to play this ...
p81
aa(lp82
V(Jackhammer)
p83
aa(lp84
Vfor more than a few seconds, you'd feel uncomfortable;
p85
aVfor more than a few minutes, you'd be leaving the room in droves.
p86
aVFor people who can't get away from noise like that,
p87
aVit's extremely damaging for their health.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd that's not the only thing that bad sound damages.
p90
aVMost retail sound is inappropriate and accidental, even hostile,
p91
aVand it has a dramatic effect on sales.
p92
aVFor you retailers, you may want to look away before I show this slide.
p93
aa(lp94
V[Inappropriate retail soundscapes sales down 28%]
p95
aa(lp96
VThey're losing up to 30 percent of their business
p97
aVwith people leaving shops faster, or just turning around at the door.
p98
aVWe've all done it, left the area,
p99
aVbecause the sound in there is so dreadful.
p100
aa(lp101
VI want to spend just a moment talking about the model we've developed,
p102
aVwhich allows us to start at the top and look at the drivers of sound,
p103
aVanalyze the soundscape
p104
aVand then predict the four outcomes I just talked about.
p105
aVOr start at the bottom and say what outcomes we want,
p106
aVand then design a soundscape to have a desired effect.
p107
aVAt last we've got some science we can apply.
p108
aVAnd we're in the business of designing soundscapes.
p109
aa(lp110
VJust a word on music.
p111
aVMusic is the most powerful sound there is, often inappropriately deployed.
p112
aVIt's powerful for two reasons:
p113
aVyou recognize it fast, and you associate it very powerfully.
p114
aVI'll give you two examples.
p115
aa(lp116
V(First chord of "A Hard Day's Night")
p117
aa(lp118
VMost of you recognize that immediately.
p119
aVThe younger, maybe not.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
V(First notes of "Jaws" theme)
p124
aa(lp125
VMost of you associate that with something!
p126
aVNow, those are one-second samples of music.
p127
aVMusic is very powerful,
p128
aVand unfortunately, it's veneering commercial spaces, often inappropriately.
p129
aVI hope that's going to change over the next few years.
p130
aa(lp131
VLet me talk about brands for a moment, since some of you run brands.
p132
aVEvery brand is out there making sound right now.
p133
aVThere are eight expressions of a brand in sound; they're all important.
p134
aVAnd every brand needs to have guidelines at the center.
p135
aVI'm glad to say that is starting to happen now.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Intel ad jingle)
p138
aa(lp139
VYou all recognize that one.
p140
aa(lp141
V(Nokia ringtone)
p142
aa(lp143
VThis is the most-played tune in the world today \u2014
p144
aV1.8 billion times a day, that tune is played.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd it cost Nokia absolutely nothing.
p149
aa(lp150
VI'll leave you with four golden rules, for those of you who run businesses,
p151
aVfor commercial sound.
p152
aVFirst, make it congruent,
p153
aVpointing in the same direction as your visual communication.
p154
aVThat increases impact by over 1,100 percent.
p155
aVIf your sound is pointing the opposite direction, incongruent,
p156
aVyou reduce impact by 86 percent.
p157
aVThat's an order of magnitude, up or down.
p158
aVThis is important.
p159
aVSecondly, make it appropriate to the situation.
p160
aVThirdly, make it valuable.
p161
aVGive people something with the sound, don't just bombard them with stuff.
p162
aVFinally, test and test it again.
p163
aVSound is complex; there are many countervailing influences.
p164
aVIt can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti:
p165
aVsometimes you just have to eat it and see what happens.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo I hope this talk has raised sound in your consciousness.
p168
aVIf you're listening consciously,
p169
aVyou can take control of the sound around you.
p170
aVIt's good for your health and for your productivity.
p171
aVIf we all do that, we move to a state
p172
aVthat I like to think will be sound living in the world.
p173
aVI'll leave you with more birdsong. (Birds chirping)
p174
aVI recommend at least five minutes a day, but there's no maximum dose.
p175
aa(lp176
VThank you for lending me your ears today.
