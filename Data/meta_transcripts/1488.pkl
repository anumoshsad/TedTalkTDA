VAs a kid, I was fascinated with all things air and space.
p4
aVI would watch Nova on PBS.
p5
aVOur school would show Bill Nye the Science Guy.
p6
aVWhen I was in elementary school, my next door neighbor,
p7
aVhe gave me a book for my birthday.
p8
aVIt was an astronomy book,
p9
aVand I poured over that thing for hours on end,
p10
aVand it was a combination of all these things
p11
aVthat inspired me to pursue space exploration
p12
aVas my own personal dream, and part of that dream was,
p13
aVI always wanted to just fly around the solar system
p14
aVand visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft.
p15
aa(lp16
VWell, a number of years later, I graduated from UCLA
p17
aVand I found myself at NASA,
p18
aVworking for the jet propulsion laboratory,
p19
aVand there our team was challenged
p20
aVto create a 3D visualization of the solar system,
p21
aVand today I want to show you what we've done so far.
p22
aa(lp23
VNow, the kicker is, everything I'm about to do here
p24
aVyou can do at home, because we built this
p25
aVfor the public for you guys to use.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo what you're looking at right now is the Earth.
p28
aVYou can see the United States and California
p29
aVand San Diego, and you can use the mouse
p30
aVor the keyboard to spin things around.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow, this isn't new. Anyone who's used Google Earth
p33
aVhas seen this before, but one thing we like to say
p34
aVin our group is, we do the opposite of Google Earth.
p35
aVGoogle Earth goes from this view down to your backyard.
p36
aVWe go from this view out to the stars.
p37
aVSo the Earth is cool, but what we really want to show
p38
aVare the spacecraft,
p39
aVso I'm going to bring the interface back up,
p40
aVand now you're looking at a number of satellites
p41
aVorbiting the Earth.
p42
aVThese are a number of our science space Earth orbiters.
p43
aVWe haven't included military satellites and weather satellites
p44
aVand communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites.
p45
aVIf we did, it would be a complete mess,
p46
aVbecause there's a lot of stuff out there.
p47
aVAnd the cool thing is, we actually created 3D models
p48
aVfor a number of these spacecraft, so if you want to visit
p49
aVany of these, all you need to do is double-click on them.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo I'm going to find the International Space Station,
p52
aVdouble-click, and it will take us all the way down to the ISS.
p53
aVAnd now you're riding along with the ISS
p54
aVwhere it is right now.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd the other cool thing is, not only can we
p57
aVmove the camera around, we can also control time,
p58
aVso I can slide this jog dial here
p59
aVto shuttle time forward, and now
p60
aVwe can see what a sunset on the ISS would look like,
p61
aVand they get one every 90 minutes. (Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VAll right, so what about the rest of it?
p64
aVWell, I can click on this home button over here,
p65
aVand that will take us up to the inner solar system,
p66
aVand now we're looking at the rest of the solar system.
p67
aVYou can see, there's Saturn, there's Jupiter,
p68
aVand while we're here, I want to point out something.
p69
aVIt's actually pretty busy.
p70
aa(lp71
VHere we have the Mars Science Laboratory
p72
aVon its way to Mars, just launched last weekend.
p73
aa(lp74
VHere we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter, there.
p75
aVWe have Dawn orbiting Vesta,
p76
aVand we have over here New Horizons
p77
aVon a straight shot to Pluto.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd I mention this because
p80
aVthere's this strange public perception that
p81
aVNASA's dead, that the space shuttles stopped flying
p82
aVand all of the sudden there's no more spacecraft out there.
p83
aa(lp84
VWell, a lot of what NASA does is robotic exploration,
p85
aVand we have a lot of spacecraft out there.
p86
aVGranted, we're not sending humans up at the moment,
p87
aVwell at least with our own launch vehicles,
p88
aVbut NASA is far from dead,
p89
aVand one of the reasons why we write a program like this
p90
aVis so that people realize that there's so many other things
p91
aVthat we're doing.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnyway, while we're here, again,
p94
aVif you want to visit anything,
p95
aVall you need to do is double-click.
p96
aVSo I'm just going to double-click on Vesta,
p97
aVand here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta,
p98
aVand this is happening right now.
p99
aVI'm going to double-click on Uranus, and we can see
p100
aVUranus rotating on its side along with its moons.
p101
aVYou can see how it's tilted at about 89 degrees.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd just being able to visit different places
p104
aVand go through different times,
p105
aVwe have data from 1950 to 2050.
p106
aVGranted, we don't have everything in between,
p107
aVbecause some of the data is hard to get.
p108
aVJust being able to visit places in different times,
p109
aVyou can explore this for hours,
p110
aVliterally hours on end,
p111
aVbut I want to show you one thing in particular,
p112
aVso I'm going to open up the destination tab,
p113
aVspacecraft outer planet missions, Voyager 1,
p114
aVand I'm going to bring up the Titan flyby.
p115
aVSo now we've gone back in time.
p116
aVWe're now riding along with Voyager 1.
p117
aVThe date here is November 11, 1980.
p118
aa(lp119
VNow, there's a funny thing going on here.
p120
aVIt doesn't look like anything's going on.
p121
aVIt looks like I've paused the program.
p122
aVIt's actually running at real rate right now,
p123
aVone second per second, and in fact,
p124
aVVoyager 1 here is flying by Titan at
p125
aVI think it's 38,000 miles per hour.
p126
aVIt only looks like nothing's moving because, well,
p127
aVSaturn here is 700,000 miles away,
p128
aVand Titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away.
p129
aVIt's just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing's happening.
p130
aa(lp131
VBut to make it more interesting,
p132
aVI'm going to speed up time, and we can watch
p133
aVas Voyager 1 flies by Titan,
p134
aVwhich is a hazy moon of Saturn.
p135
aVIt actually has a very thick atmosphere.
p136
aVAnd I'm going to recenter the camera on Saturn, here.
p137
aVI'm going to pull out, and I want to show you
p138
aVVoyager 1 as it flies by Saturn.
p139
aa(lp140
VThere's a point to be made here.
p141
aVWith a 3D visualization like this,
p142
aVwe can not only just say Voyager 1 flew by Saturn.
p143
aVThere's a whole story to tell here.
p144
aVAnd even better, because it's an interactive application,
p145
aVyou can tell the story for yourself.
p146
aVIf you want to pause it, you can pause it.
p147
aVIf you want to keep going, if you want to change
p148
aVthe camera angle, you can do that,
p149
aVand because of that, I can show you
p150
aVthat Voyager 1 doesn't just fly by Saturn.
p151
aVIt actually flies underneath Saturn.
p152
aVNow, what happens is, as it flies underneath Saturn,
p153
aVSaturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up
p154
aVand out of the solar system,
p155
aVso if I just keep letting this go,
p156
aVyou can see Voyager 1 fly up like that.
p157
aVAnd, in fact, I'm going to go back to the solar system.
p158
aVI'm going to go back to today, now,
p159
aVand I want to show you where Voyager 1 is.
p160
aVRight there, above, way above the solar system,
p161
aVway beyond our solar system.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd here's the thing. Now you know how it got there.
p164
aVNow you know why, and to me,
p165
aVthat's the point of this program.
p166
aVYou can manipulate it yourself.
p167
aVYou can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself.
p168
aa(lp169
VYou know, the theme today is "The World In Your Grasp."
p170
aVWell, we're trying to give you
p171
aVthe solar system in your grasp \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p172
aVand we hope once it's there,
p173
aVyou'll be able to learn for yourself
p174
aVwhat we've done out there, and what we're about to do.
p175
aVAnd my personal dream is for kids to take this
p176
aVand explore and see the wonders out there
p177
aVand be inspired, as I was as a kid,
p178
aVto pursue STEM education
p179
aVand to pursue a dream in space exploration.
p180
aa(lp181
VThank you. (Applause)
