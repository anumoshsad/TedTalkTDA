VLB: This is my first work, created in November 2005.
p11
aVAnd this is Beijing International Art Camp where I worked
p12
aVbefore the government forcibly demolished it.I used this work to express my objection.
p13
aVI also want to use this work to let more people
p14
aVpay attention to the living condition of artists and the condition of their creative freedom.

aVand uncompromising spirit.

p21
aa(lp22
VAfter finishing this series of protests,
p23
aVI started questioning why my fate was like this,
p24
aVand I realized that it's not just me \u2014

p43
aVWe can only see six men in this picture,but in fact, those who are hidden here

p50
aVI picked the news photos of the day.
p51
aVOne is about the war in the Middle East,

p64
aVInterpreter: So I tried to disappear into JR's eye,
p65
aVbut the problem is JR uses only models with big eyes.

p87
aa(lp88
VThis one is called Instant Noodles.
p89
aVInterpreter: This one is called Instant Noodles. (Laughter)
p90
aVLB: Since August 2012,
p91
aVharmful phosphors have been found
p92
aVin the instant noodle package cups from every famous brand sold in China's supermarkets.
p93
aVThese phosphors can even cause cancer.
p94
aVTo create this artwork,
p95
aVI bought a lot of packaged instant noodle cups
p96
aVand put them in my studio, making it look like a supermarket.
p97
aVAnd my task is to stand there, trying to be still,
p98
aVsetting up the camera position and coordinating with my assistant
p99
aVand drawing the colors and shapes that are behind my body
p100
aVon the front of my body. If the background is simple,
p101
aVI usually have to stand for three to four hours.
p102
aVThe background of this piece is more complex,
p103
aVso I need three to four days in advance for preparation.

p112

p113
aVUnsafe food can harm people's health,
p114
aVand a deluge of magazines can confuse people's minds. (Laughter)
p115
aVThe next pieces of work show how I made myself invisible in magazines of different languages,
p116
aVin different countries and at different times.
p117
aa(lp118
VI think that in art, an artist's attitude is the most important element.
p119
aVIf an artwork is to touch someone,
p120
aVit must be the result of not only technique, but also the artist's thinking and struggle in life.
p121
aVAnd the repeated struggles in life create artwork,
p122
aVno matter in what form.
p123
