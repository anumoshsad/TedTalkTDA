VAbout 10 years ago, I went through a little bit of a hard time.
p4
aVSo I decided to go see a therapist.
p5
aVI had been seeing her for a few months, when she looked at me one day and said,
p6
aV"Who actually raised you until you were three?"
p7
aVSeemed like a weird question. I said, "My parents."
p8
aVAnd she said, "I don't think that's actually the case;
p9
aVbecause if it were,
p10
aVwe'd be dealing with things that are far more complicated than just this."
p11
aa(lp12
VIt sounded like the setup to a joke, but I knew she was serious.
p13
aVBecause when I first started seeing her,
p14
aVI was trying to be the funniest person in the room.
p15
aVAnd I would try and crack these jokes, but she caught on to me really quickly,
p16
aVand whenever I tried to make a joke, she would look at me and say,
p17
aV"That is actually really sad."
p18
aV(Laughter)
p19
aVIt's terrible.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo I knew I had to be serious, and I asked my parents
p22
aVwho had actually raised me until I was three?
p23
aVAnd to my surprise, they said
p24
aVmy primary caregiver had been a distant relative of the family.
p25
aVI had called her my auntie.
p26
aa(lp27
VI remember my auntie so clearly,
p28
aVit felt like she had been part of my life when I was much older.
p29
aVI remember the thick, straight hair,
p30
aVand how it would come around me like a curtain
p31
aVwhen she bent to pick me up;
p32
aVher soft, southern Thai accent;
p33
aVthe way I would cling to her,
p34
aVeven if she just wanted to go to the bathroom
p35
aVor get something to eat.
p36
aVI loved her, but [with] the ferocity that a child has sometimes
p37
aVbefore she understands that love also requires letting go.
p38
aa(lp39
VBut my clearest and sharpest memory of my auntie,
p40
aVis also one of my first memories of life at all.
p41
aVI remember her being beaten and slapped by another member of my family.
p42
aVI remember screaming hysterically and wanting it to stop,
p43
aVas I did every single time it happened,
p44
aVfor things as minor as wanting to go out with her friends,
p45
aVor being a little late.
p46
aVI became so hysterical over her treatment,
p47
aVthat eventually, she was just beaten behind closed doors.
p48
aa(lp49
VThings got so bad for her that eventually she ran away.
p50
aVAs an adult, I learned later
p51
aVthat she had been just 19 when she was brought over from Thailand
p52
aVto the States to care for me, on a tourist visa.
p53
aVShe wound up working in Illinois for a time,
p54
aVbefore eventually returning to Thailand,
p55
aVwhich is where I ran into her again, at a political rally in Bangkok.
p56
aVI clung to her again, as I had when I was a child,
p57
aVand I let go, and then I promised that I would call.
p58
aVI never did, though.
p59
aVBecause I was afraid if I said everything that she meant to me \u2014
p60
aVthat I owed perhaps the best parts of who I became to her care,
p61
aVand that the words "I'm sorry" were like a thimble
p62
aVto bail out all the guilt and shame and rage I felt
p63
aVover everything she had endured to care for me for as long as she had \u2014
p64
aVI thought if I said those words to her, I would never stop crying again.
p65
aVBecause she had saved me.
p66
aVAnd I had not saved her.
p67
aa(lp68
VI'm a journalist, and I've been writing and researching human trafficking
p69
aVfor the past eight years or so,
p70
aVand even so, I never put together this personal story
p71
aVwith my professional life until pretty recently.
p72
aVI think this profound disconnect actually symbolizes
p73
aVmost of our understanding about human trafficking.
p74
aVBecause human trafficking is far more prevalent, complex and close to home
p75
aVthan most of us realize.
p76
aa(lp77
VI spent time in jails and brothels,
p78
aVinterviewed hundreds of survivors and law enforcement, NGO workers.
p79
aVAnd when I think about what we've done about human trafficking,
p80
aVI am hugely disappointed.
p81
aVPartly because we don't even talk about the problem right at all.
p82
aVWhen I say "human trafficking,"
p83
aVmost of you probably don't think about someone like my auntie.
p84
aVYou probably think about a young girl or woman,
p85
aVwho's been brutally forced into prostitution by a violent pimp.
p86
aVThat is real suffering, and that is a real story.
p87
aVThat story makes me angry
p88
aVfor far more than just the reality of that situation, though.
p89
aa(lp90
VAs a journalist, I really care about how we relate to each other through language,
p91
aVand the way we tell that story, with all the gory, violent detail,
p92
aVthe salacious aspects \u2014 I call that "look at her scars" journalism.
p93
aVWe use that story to convince ourselves
p94
aVthat human trafficking is a bad man doing a bad thing to an innocent girl.
p95
aVThat story lets us off the hook.
p96
aVIt takes away all the societal context that we might be indicted for,
p97
aVfor the structural inequality, or the poverty,
p98
aVor the barriers to migration.
p99
aVWe let ourselves think
p100
aVthat human trafficking is only about forced prostitution,
p101
aVwhen in reality,
p102
aVhuman trafficking is embedded in our everyday lives.
p103
aa(lp104
VLet me show you what I mean.
p105
aVForced prostitution accounts for 22 percent of human trafficking.
p106
aVTen percent is in state- imposed forced labor.
p107
aVbut a whopping 68 percent is for the purpose of creating the goods
p108
aVand delivering the services that most of us rely on every day,
p109
aVin sectors like agricultural work, domestic work and construction.
p110
aVThat is food and care and shelter.
p111
aVAnd somehow, these most essential workers
p112
aVare also among the world's most underpaid and exploited today.
p113
aVHuman trafficking is the use of force, fraud or coercion
p114
aVto compel another person's labor.
p115
aVAnd it's found in cotton fields, and coltan mines,
p116
aVand even car washes in Norway and England.
p117
aVIt's found in U.S. military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan.
p118
aa(lp119
VIt's found in Thailand's fishing industry.
p120
aVThat country has become the largest exporter of shrimp in the world.
p121
aVBut what are the circumstances
p122
aVbehind all that cheap and plentiful shrimp?
p123
aVThai military were caught selling Burmese and Cambodian migrants
p124
aVonto fishing boats.
p125
aVThose fishing boats were taken out, the men put to work,
p126
aVand they were thrown overboard if they made the mistake of falling sick,
p127
aVor trying to resist their treatment.
p128
aVThose fish were then used to feed shrimp,
p129
aVThe shrimp were then sold to four major global retailers:
p130
aVCostco, Tesco, Walmart and Carrefour.
p131
aa(lp132
VHuman trafficking is found on a smaller scale than just that,
p133
aVand in places you would never even imagine.
p134
aVTraffickers have forced young people to drive ice cream trucks,
p135
aVor to sing in touring boys' choirs.
p136
aVTrafficking has even been found in a hair braiding salon in New Jersey.
p137
aa(lp138
VThe scheme in that case was incredible.
p139
aVThe traffickers found young families who were from Ghana and Togo,
p140
aVand they told these families that "your daughters are going to get
p141
aVa fine education in the United States."
p142
aVThey then located winners of the green card lottery,
p143
aVand they told them, "We'll help you out.
p144
aVWe'll get you a plane ticket. We'll pay your fees.
p145
aVAll you have to do is take this young girl with you,
p146
aVsay that she's your sister or your spouse.
p147
aVOnce everyone arrived in New Jersey, the young girls were taken away,
p148
aVand put to work for 14-hour days,
p149
aVseven days a week, for five years.
p150
aVThey made their traffickers nearly four million dollars.
p151
aa(lp152
VThis is a huge problem.
p153
aVSo what have we done about it?
p154
aVWe've mostly turned to the criminal justice system.
p155
aVBut keep in mind, most victims of human trafficking are poor and marginalized.
p156
aVThey're migrants, people of color.
p157
aVSometimes they're in the sex trade.
p158
aVAnd for populations like these,
p159
aVthe criminal justice system is too often part of the problem,
p160
aVrather than the solution.
p161
aVIn study after study, in countries ranging from Bangladesh to the United States,
p162
aVbetween 20 and 60 percent of the people in the sex trade who were surveyed
p163
aVsaid that they had been raped or assaulted by the police in the past year alone.
p164
aVPeople in prostitution, including people who have been trafficked into it,
p165
aVregularly receive multiple convictions for prostitution.
p166
aVHaving that criminal record makes it so much more difficult
p167
aVto leave poverty, leave abuse, or leave prostitution,
p168
aVif that person so desires.
p169
aVWorkers outside of the sex sector \u2014
p170
aVif they try and resist their treatment, they risk deportation.
p171
aVIn case after case I've studied, employers have no problem
p172
aVcalling on law enforcement to try and threaten or deport
p173
aVtheir striking trafficked workers.
p174
aVIf those workers run away,
p175
aVthey risk becoming part of the great mass of undocumented workers
p176
aVwho are also subject to the whims of law enforcement if they're caught.
p177
aa(lp178
VLaw enforcement is supposed to identify victims and prosecute traffickers.
p179
aVBut out of an estimated 21 million victims of human trafficking in the world,
p180
aVthey have helped and identified fewer than 50,000 people.
p181
aVThat's like comparing
p182
aVthe population of the world to the population of Los Angeles,
p183
aVproportionally speaking.
p184
aVAs for convictions, out of an estimated 5,700 convictions in 2013,
p185
aVfewer than 500 were for labor trafficking.
p186
aVKeep in mind that labor trafficking
p187
aVaccounts for 68 percent of all trafficking,
p188
aVbut fewer than 10 percent of the convictions.
p189
aa(lp190
VI've heard one expert say that trafficking happens where need meets greed.
p191
aVI'd like to add one more element to that.
p192
aVTrafficking happens in sectors where workers are excluded from protections,
p193
aVand denied the right to organize.
p194
aVTrafficking doesn't happen in a vacuum.
p195
aVIt happens in systematically degraded work environments.
p196
aVYou might be thinking,
p197
aVoh, she's talking about failed states, or war-torn states, or \u2014
p198
aVI'm actually talking about the United States.
p199
aVLet me tell you what that looks like.
p200
aa(lp201
VI spent many months researching a trafficking case called Global Horizons,
p202
aVinvolving hundreds of Thai farm workers.
p203
aVThey were sent all over the States, to work in Hawaii pineapple plantations,
p204
aVand Washington apple orchards, and anywhere the work was needed.
p205
aVThey were promised three years of solid agricultural work.
p206
aVSo they made a calculated risk.
p207
aVThey sold their land, they sold their wives' jewelry,
p208
aVto make thousands in recruitment fees for this company, Global Horizons.
p209
aVBut once they were brought over,
p210
aVtheir passports were confiscated.
p211
aVSome of the men were beaten and held at gunpoint.
p212
aVThey worked so hard they fainted in the fields.
p213
aVThis case hit me so hard.
p214
aa(lp215
VAfter I came back home,
p216
aVI was wandering through the grocery store, and I froze in the produce department.
p217
aVI was remembering the over-the-top meals the Global Horizons survivors
p218
aVwould make for me every time I showed up to interview them.
p219
aVThey finished one meal with this plate of perfect, long-stemmed strawberries,
p220
aVand as they handed them to me, they said,
p221
aV"Aren't these the kind of strawberries you eat with somebody special
p222
aVin the States?
p223
aVAnd don't they taste so much better
p224
aVwhen you know the people whose hands picked them for you?"
p225
aa(lp226
VAs I stood in that grocery store weeks later, I realized I had no idea
p227
aVof who to thank for this plenty,
p228
aVand no idea of how they were being treated.
p229
aVSo, like the journalist I am, I started digging into the agricultural sector.
p230
aVAnd I found there are too many fields, and too few labor inspectors.
p231
aVI found multiple layers of plausible deniability
p232
aVbetween grower and distributor and processor, and God knows who else.
p233
aVThe Global Horizons survivors had been brought to the States
p234
aVon a temporary guest worker program.
p235
aVThat guest worker program ties a person's legal status
p236
aVto his or her employer,
p237
aVand denies that worker the right to organize.
p238
aVMind you, none of what I am describing about this agricultural sector
p239
aVor the guest worker program is actually human trafficking.
p240
aVIt is merely what we find legally tolerable.
p241
aVAnd I would argue this is fertile ground for exploitation.
p242
aVAnd all of this had been hidden to me, before I had tried to understand it.
p243
aa(lp244
VI wasn't the only person grappling with these issues.
p245
aVPierre Omidyar, founder of eBay,
p246
aVis one of the biggest anti-trafficking philanthropists in the world.
p247
aVAnd even he wound up accidentally investing nearly 10 million dollars
p248
aVin the pineapple plantation cited as having the worst working conditions
p249
aVin that Global Horizons case.
p250
aVWhen he found out, he and his wife were shocked and horrified,
p251
aVand they wound up writing an op-ed for a newspaper,
p252
aVsaying that it was up to all of us to learn everything we can
p253
aVabout the labor and supply chains of the products that we support.
p254
aVI totally agree.
p255
aa(lp256
VWhat would happen if each one of us decided
p257
aVthat we are no longer going to support companies
p258
aVif they don't eliminate exploitation from their labor and supply chains?
p259
aVIf we demanded laws calling for the same?
p260
aVIf all the CEOs out there decided
p261
aVthat they were going to go through their businesses and say, "no more"?
p262
aVIf we ended recruitment fees for migrant workers?
p263
aVIf we decided that guest workers should have the right to organize
p264
aVwithout fear of retaliation?
p265
aVThese would be decisions heard around the world.
p266
aVThis isn't a matter of buying a fair-trade peach
p267
aVand calling it a day, buying a guilt-free zone with your money.
p268
aVThat's not how it works.
p269
aVThis is the decision to change a system that is broken,
p270
aVand that we have unwittingly but willingly
p271
aVallowed ourselves to profit from and benefit from for too long.
p272
aa(lp273
VWe often dwell on human trafficking survivors' victimization.
p274
aVBut that is not my experience of them.
p275
aVOver all the years that I've been talking to them,
p276
aVthey have taught me that we are more than our worst days.
p277
aVEach one of us is more than what we have lived through.
p278
aVEspecially trafficking survivors.
p279
aVThese people were the most resourceful and resilient and responsible
p280
aVin their communities.
p281
aVThey were the people that you would take a gamble on.
p282
aVYou'd say, I'm gong to sell my rings, because I have the chance
p283
aVto send you off to a better future.
p284
aVThey were the emissaries of hope.
p285
aa(lp286
VThese survivors don't need saving.
p287
aVThey need solidarity, because they're behind
p288
aVsome of the most exciting social justice movements out there today.
p289
aVThe nannies and housekeepers who marched with their families
p290
aVand their employers' families \u2014
p291
aVtheir activism got us an international treaty
p292
aVon domestic workers' rights.
p293
aVThe Nepali women who were trafficked into the sex trade \u2014
p294
aVthey came together, and they decided
p295
aVthat they were going to make the world's first anti-trafficking organization
p296
aVactually headed and run by trafficking survivors themselves.
p297
aVThese Indian shipyard workers were trafficked
p298
aVto do post-Hurricane Katrina reconstruction.
p299
aVThey were threatened with deportation, but they broke out of their work compound
p300
aVand they marched from New Orleans to Washington, D.C.,
p301
aVto protest labor exploitation.
p302
aVThey cofounded an organization called the National Guest Worker Alliance,
p303
aVand through this organization, they have wound up helping other workers
p304
aVbring to light exploitation and abuses in supply chains
p305
aVin Walmart and Hershey's factories.
p306
aVAnd although the Department of Justice declined to take their case,
p307
aVa team of civil rights lawyers won the first of a dozen civil suits
p308
aVthis February, and got their clients 14 million dollars.
p309
aa(lp310
VThese survivors are fighting for people they don't even know yet,
p311
aVother workers, and for the possibility of a just world for all of us.
p312
aVThis is our chance to do the same.
p313
aVThis is our chance to make the decision
p314
aVthat tells us who we are, as a people and as a society;
p315
aVthat our prosperity is no longer prosperity,
p316
aVas long as it is pinned to other people's pain;
p317
aVthat our lives are inextricably woven together;
p318
aVand that we have the power to make a different choice.
p319
aa(lp320
VI was so reluctant to share my story of my auntie with you.
p321
aVBefore I started this TED process and climbed up on this stage,
p322
aVI had told literally a handful of people about it,
p323
aVbecause, like many a journalist,
p324
aVI am far more interested in learning about your stories
p325
aVthan sharing much, if anything, about my own.
p326
aVI also haven't done my journalistic due diligence on this.
p327
aVI haven't issued my mountains of document requests,
p328
aVand interviewed everyone and their mother,
p329
aVand I haven't found my auntie yet.
p330
aVI don't know her story of what happened, and of her life now.
p331
aVThe story as I've told it to you is messy and unfinished.
p332
aVBut I think it mirrors the messy and unfinished situation we're all in,
p333
aVwhen it comes to human trafficking.
p334
aVWe are all implicated in this problem.
p335
aVBut that means we are all also part of its solution.
p336
aVFiguring out how to build a more just world is our work to do,
p337
aVand our story to tell.
p338
aVSo let us tell it the way we should have done,
p339
aVfrom the very beginning.
p340
aVLet us tell this story together.
p341
aa(lp342
