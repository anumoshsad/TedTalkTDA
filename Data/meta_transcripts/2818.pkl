VIn ancient Greece,
p4
aVwhen anyone from slaves to soldiers, poets and politicians,
p5
aVneeded to make a big decision on life's most important questions,
p6
aVlike, "Should I get married?"
p7
aVor "Should we embark on this voyage?"
p8
aVor "Should our army advance into this territory?"
p9
aVthey all consulted the oracle.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo this is how it worked:
p12
aVyou would bring her a question and you would get on your knees,
p13
aVand then she would go into this trance.
p14
aVIt would take a couple of days,
p15
aVand then eventually she would come out of it,
p16
aVgiving you her predictions as your answer.
p17
aa(lp18
VFrom the oracle bones of ancient China
p19
aVto ancient Greece to Mayan calendars,
p20
aVpeople have craved for prophecy
p21
aVin order to find out what's going to happen next.
p22
aVAnd that's because we all want to make the right decision.
p23
aVWe don't want to miss something.
p24
aVThe future is scary,
p25
aVso it's much nicer knowing that we can make a decision
p26
aVwith some assurance of the outcome.
p27
aa(lp28
VWell, we have a new oracle,
p29
aVand it's name is big data,
p30
aVor we call it "Watson" or "deep learning" or "neural net."
p31
aVAnd these are the kinds of questions we ask of our oracle now,
p32
aVlike, "What's the most efficient way to ship these phones
p33
aVfrom China to Sweden?"
p34
aVOr, "What are the odds
p35
aVof my child being born with a genetic disorder?"
p36
aVOr, "What are the sales volume we can predict for this product?"
p37
aa(lp38
VI have a dog. Her name is Elle, and she hates the rain.
p39
aVAnd I have tried everything to untrain her.
p40
aVBut because I have failed at this,
p41
aVI also have to consult an oracle, called Dark Sky,
p42
aVevery time before we go on a walk,
p43
aVfor very accurate weather predictions in the next 10 minutes.
p44
aVShe's so sweet.
p45
aVSo because of all of this, our oracle is a $122 billion industry.
p46
aa(lp47
VNow, despite the size of this industry,
p48
aVthe returns are surprisingly low.
p49
aVInvesting in big data is easy,
p50
aVbut using it is hard.
p51
aVOver 73 percent of big data projects aren't even profitable,
p52
aVand I have executives coming up to me saying,
p53
aV"We're experiencing the same thing.
p54
aVWe invested in some big data system,
p55
aVand our employees aren't making better decisions.
p56
aVAnd they're certainly not coming up with more breakthrough ideas."
p57
aa(lp58
VSo this is all really interesting to me,
p59
aVbecause I'm a technology ethnographer.
p60
aVI study and I advise companies
p61
aVon the patterns of how people use technology,
p62
aVand one of my interest areas is data.
p63
aVSo why is having more data not helping us make better decisions,
p64
aVespecially for companies who have all these resources
p65
aVto invest in these big data systems?
p66
aVWhy isn't it getting any easier for them?
p67
aa(lp68
VSo, I've witnessed the struggle firsthand.
p69
aVIn 2009, I started a research position with Nokia.
p70
aVAnd at the time,
p71
aVNokia was one of the largest cell phone companies in the world,
p72
aVdominating emerging markets like China, Mexico and India \u2014
p73
aVall places where I had done a lot of research
p74
aVon how low-income people use technology.
p75
aVAnd I spent a lot of extra time in China
p76
aVgetting to know the informal economy.
p77
aVSo I did things like working as a street vendor
p78
aVselling dumplings to construction workers.
p79
aVOr I did fieldwork,
p80
aVspending nights and days in internet cafés,
p81
aVhanging out with Chinese youth, so I could understand
p82
aVhow they were using games and mobile phones
p83
aVand using it between moving from the rural areas to the cities.
p84
aa(lp85
VThrough all of this qualitative evidence that I was gathering,
p86
aVI was starting to see so clearly
p87
aVthat a big change was about to happen among low-income Chinese people.
p88
aVEven though they were surrounded by advertisements for luxury products
p89
aVlike fancy toilets \u2014 who wouldn't want one? \u2014
p90
aVand apartments and cars,
p91
aVthrough my conversations with them,
p92
aVI found out that the ads the actually enticed them the most
p93
aVwere the ones for iPhones,
p94
aVpromising them this entry into this high-tech life.
p95
aVAnd even when I was living with them in urban slums like this one,
p96
aVI saw people investing over half of their monthly income
p97
aVinto buying a phone,
p98
aVand increasingly, they were "shanzhai,"
p99
aVwhich are affordable knock-offs of iPhones and other brands.
p100
aVThey're very usable.
p101
aVDoes the job.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd after years of living with migrants and working with them
p104
aVand just really doing everything that they were doing,
p105
aVI started piecing all these data points together \u2014
p106
aVfrom the things that seem random, like me selling dumplings,
p107
aVto the things that were more obvious,
p108
aVlike tracking how much they were spending on their cell phone bills.
p109
aVAnd I was able to create this much more holistic picture
p110
aVof what was happening.
p111
aVAnd that's when I started to realize
p112
aVthat even the poorest in China would want a smartphone,
p113
aVand that they would do almost anything to get their hands on one.
p114
aa(lp115
VYou have to keep in mind,
p116
aViPhones had just come out, it was 2009,
p117
aVso this was, like, eight years ago,
p118
aVand Androids had just started looking like iPhones.
p119
aVAnd a lot of very smart and realistic people said,
p120
aV"Those smartphones \u2014 that's just a fad.
p121
aVWho wants to carry around these heavy things
p122
aVwhere batteries drain quickly and they break every time you drop them?"
p123
aVBut I had a lot of data,
p124
aVand I was very confident about my insights,
p125
aVso I was very excited to share them with Nokia.
p126
aa(lp127
VBut Nokia was not convinced,
p128
aVbecause it wasn't big data.
p129
aVThey said, "We have millions of data points,
p130
aVand we don't see any indicators of anyone wanting to buy a smartphone,
p131
aVand your data set of 100, as diverse as it is, is too weak
p132
aVfor us to even take seriously."
p133
aVAnd I said, "Nokia, you're right.
p134
aVOf course you wouldn't see this,
p135
aVbecause you're sending out surveys assuming that people don't know
p136
aVwhat a smartphone is,
p137
aVso of course you're not going to get any data back
p138
aVabout people wanting to buy a smartphone in two years.
p139
aVYour surveys, your methods have been designed
p140
aVto optimize an existing business model,
p141
aVand I'm looking at these emergent human dynamics
p142
aVthat haven't happened yet.
p143
aVWe're looking outside of market dynamics
p144
aVso that we can get ahead of it."
p145
aVWell, you know what happened to Nokia?
p146
aVTheir business fell off a cliff.
p147
aVThis \u2014 this is the cost of missing something.
p148
aVIt was unfathomable.
p149
aa(lp150
VBut Nokia's not alone.
p151
aVI see organizations throwing out data all the time
p152
aVbecause it didn't come from a quant model
p153
aVor it doesn't fit in one.
p154
aVBut it's not big data's fault.
p155
aVIt's the way we use big data; it's our responsibility.
p156
aVBig data's reputation for success
p157
aVcomes from quantifying very specific environments,
p158
aVlike electricity power grids or delivery logistics or genetic code,
p159
aVwhen we're quantifying in systems that are more or less contained.
p160
aa(lp161
VBut not all systems are as neatly contained.
p162
aVWhen you're quantifying and systems are more dynamic,
p163
aVespecially systems that involve human beings,
p164
aVforces are complex and unpredictable,
p165
aVand these are things that we don't know how to model so well.
p166
aVOnce you predict something about human behavior,
p167
aVnew factors emerge,
p168
aVbecause conditions are constantly changing.
p169
aVThat's why it's a never-ending cycle.
p170
aVYou think you know something,
p171
aVand then something unknown enters the picture.
p172
aVAnd that's why just relying on big data alone
p173
aVincreases the chance that we'll miss something,
p174
aVwhile giving us this illusion that we already know everything.
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd what makes it really hard to see this paradox
p177
aVand even wrap our brains around it
p178
aVis that we have this thing that I call the quantification bias,
p179
aVwhich is the unconscious belief of valuing the measurable
p180
aVover the immeasurable.
p181
aVAnd we often experience this at our work.
p182
aVMaybe we work alongside colleagues who are like this,
p183
aVor even our whole entire company may be like this,
p184
aVwhere people become so fixated on that number,
p185
aVthat they can't see anything outside of it,
p186
aVeven when you present them evidence right in front of their face.
p187
aVAnd this is a very appealing message,
p188
aVbecause there's nothing wrong with quantifying;
p189
aVit's actually very satisfying.
p190
aVI get a great sense of comfort from looking at an Excel spreadsheet,
p191
aVeven very simple ones.
p192
aa(lp193
V(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VIt's just kind of like,
p196
aV"Yes! The formula worked. It's all OK. Everything is under control."
p197
aa(lp198
VBut the problem is
p199
aVthat quantifying is addictive.
p200
aVAnd when we forget that
p201
aVand when we don't have something to kind of keep that in check,
p202
aVit's very easy to just throw out data
p203
aVbecause it can't be expressed as a numerical value.
p204
aVIt's very easy just to slip into silver-bullet thinking,
p205
aVas if some simple solution existed.
p206
aVBecause this is a great moment of danger for any organization,
p207
aVbecause oftentimes, the future we need to predict \u2014
p208
aVit isn't in that haystack,
p209
aVbut it's that tornado that's bearing down on us
p210
aVoutside of the barn.
p211
aVThere is no greater risk
p212
aVthan being blind to the unknown.
p213
aVIt can cause you to make the wrong decisions.
p214
aVIt can cause you to miss something big.
p215
aa(lp216
VBut we don't have to go down this path.
p217
aVIt turns out that the oracle of ancient Greece
p218
aVholds the secret key that shows us the path forward.
p219
aVNow, recent geological research has shown
p220
aVthat the Temple of Apollo, where the most famous oracle sat,
p221
aVwas actually built over two earthquake faults.
p222
aVAnd these faults would release these petrochemical fumes
p223
aVfrom underneath the Earth's crust,
p224
aVand the oracle literally sat right above these faults,
p225
aVinhaling enormous amounts of ethylene gas, these fissures.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VIt's true.
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aVIt's all true, and that's what made her babble and hallucinate
p233
aVand go into this trance-like state.
p234
aVShe was high as a kite!
p235
aa(lp236
V(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VSo how did anyone \u2014
p239
aVHow did anyone get any useful advice out of her
p240
aVin this state?
p241
aVWell, you see those people surrounding the oracle?
p242
aVYou see those people holding her up,
p243
aVbecause she's, like, a little woozy?
p244
aVAnd you see that guy on your left-hand side
p245
aVholding the orange notebook?
p246
aVWell, those were the temple guides,
p247
aVand they worked hand in hand with the oracle.
p248
aVWhen inquisitors would come and get on their knees,
p249
aVthat's when the temple guides would get to work,
p250
aVbecause after they asked her questions,
p251
aVthey would observe their emotional state,
p252
aVand then they would ask them follow-up questions,
p253
aVlike, "Why do you want to know this prophecy? Who are you?
p254
aVWhat are you going to do with this information?"
p255
aVAnd then the temple guides would take this more ethnographic,
p256
aVthis more qualitative information,
p257
aVand interpret the oracle's babblings.
p258
aVSo the oracle didn't stand alone,
p259
aVand neither should our big data systems.
p260
aa(lp261
VNow to be clear,
p262
aVI'm not saying that big data systems are huffing ethylene gas,
p263
aVor that they're even giving invalid predictions.
p264
aVThe total opposite.
p265
aVBut what I am saying
p266
aVis that in the same way that the oracle needed her temple guides,
p267
aVour big data systems need them, too.
p268
aVThey need people like ethnographers and user researchers
p269
aVwho can gather what I call thick data.
p270
aVThis is precious data from humans,
p271
aVlike stories, emotions and interactions that cannot be quantified.
p272
aVIt's the kind of data that I collected for Nokia
p273
aVthat comes in in the form of a very small sample size,
p274
aVbut delivers incredible depth of meaning.
p275
aa(lp276
VAnd what makes it so thick and meaty
p277
aVis the experience of understanding the human narrative.
p278
aVAnd that's what helps to see what's missing in our models.
p279
aVThick data grounds our business questions in human questions,
p280
aVand that's why integrating big and thick data
p281
aVforms a more complete picture.
p282
aVBig data is able to offer insights at scale
p283
aVand leverage the best of machine intelligence,
p284
aVwhereas thick data can help us rescue the context loss
p285
aVthat comes from making big data usable,
p286
aVand leverage the best of human intelligence.
p287
aVAnd when you actually integrate the two, that's when things get really fun,
p288
aVbecause then you're no longer just working with data
p289
aVyou've already collected.
p290
aVYou get to also work with data that hasn't been collected.
p291
aVYou get to ask questions about why:
p292
aVWhy is this happening?
p293
aa(lp294
VNow, when Netflix did this,
p295
aVthey unlocked a whole new way to transform their business.
p296
aVNetflix is known for their really great recommendation algorithm,
p297
aVand they had this $1 million prize for anyone who could improve it.
p298
aVAnd there were winners.
p299
aVBut Netflix discovered the improvements were only incremental.
p300
aVSo to really find out what was going on,
p301
aVthey hired an ethnographer, Grant McCracken,
p302
aVto gather thick data insights.
p303
aVAnd what he discovered was something that they hadn't seen initially
p304
aVin the quantitative data.
p305
aVHe discovered that people loved to binge-watch.
p306
aVIn fact, people didn't even feel guilty about it.
p307
aVThey enjoyed it.
p308
aa(lp309
V(Laughter)
p310
aa(lp311
VSo Netflix was like, "Oh. This is a new insight."
p312
aVSo they went to their data science team,
p313
aVand they were able to scale this big data insight
p314
aVin with their quantitative data.
p315
aVAnd once they verified it and validated it,
p316
aVNetflix decided to do something very simple but impactful.
p317
aVThey said, instead of offering the same show from different genres
p318
aVor more of the different shows from similar users,
p319
aVwe'll just offer more of the same show.
p320
aVWe'll make it easier for you to binge-watch.
p321
aVAnd they didn't stop there.
p322
aVThey did all these things
p323
aVto redesign their entire viewer experience,
p324
aVto really encourage binge-watching.
p325
aVIt's why people and friends disappear for whole weekends at a time,
p326
aVcatching up on shows like "Master of None."
p327
aVBy integrating big data and thick data, they not only improved their business,
p328
aVbut they transformed how we consume media.
p329
aVAnd now their stocks are projected to double in the next few years.
p330
aa(lp331
VBut this isn't just about watching more videos
p332
aVor selling more smartphones.
p333
aVFor some, integrating thick data insights into the algorithm
p334
aVcould mean life or death,
p335
aVespecially for the marginalized.
p336
aVAll around the country, police departments are using big data
p337
aVfor predictive policing,
p338
aVto set bond amounts and sentencing recommendations
p339
aVin ways that reinforce existing biases.
p340
aVNSA's Skynet machine learning algorithm
p341
aVhas possibly aided in the deaths of thousands of civilians in Pakistan
p342
aVfrom misreading cellular device metadata.
p343
aVAs all of our lives become more automated,
p344
aVfrom automobiles to health insurance or to employment,
p345
aVit is likely that all of us
p346
aVwill be impacted by the quantification bias.
p347
aa(lp348
VNow, the good news is that we've come a long way
p349
aVfrom huffing ethylene gas to make predictions.
p350
aVWe have better tools, so let's just use them better.
p351
aVLet's integrate the big data with the thick data.
p352
aVLet's bring our temple guides with the oracles,
p353
aVand whether this work happens in companies or nonprofits
p354
aVor government or even in the software,
p355
aVall of it matters,
p356
aVbecause that means we're collectively committed
p357
aVto making better data,
p358
aVbetter algorithms, better outputs
p359
aVand better decisions.
p360
aVThis is how we'll avoid missing that something.
