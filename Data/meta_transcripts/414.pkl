VSo I understand that this meeting was planned,
p4
aVand the slogan was From Was to Still.
p5
aVAnd I am illustrating Still.
p6
aVWhich, of course, I am not agreeing with because,
p7
aValthough I am 94, I am not still working.
p8
aVAnd anybody who asks me, "Are you still doing this or that?"
p9
aVI don't answer because I'm not doing things still, I'm doing it like I always did.
p10
aVI still have \u2014 or did I use the word still? I didn't mean that.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VI have my file which is called To Do. I have my plans.
p15
aVI have my clients. I am doing my work like I always did.
p16
aVSo this takes care of my age.
p17
aVI want to show you my work so you know what I am doing and why I am here.
p18
aVThis was about 1925.
p19
aVAll of these things were made during the last 75 years.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
V(Applause)
p24
aa(lp25
VBut, of course, I'm working since 25,
p26
aVdoing more or less what you see here. This is Castleton China.
p27
aVThis was an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.
p28
aVThis is now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum.
p29
aVThis is still at the Metropolitan Museum now for sale.
p30
aVThis is a portrait of my daughter and myself.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Applause)
p33
aa(lp34
VThese were just some of the things I've made.
p35
aVI made hundreds of them for the last 75 years.
p36
aVI call myself a maker of things.
p37
aVI don't call myself an industrial designer because I'm other things.
p38
aVIndustrial designers want to make novel things.
p39
aVNovelty is a concept of commerce, not an aesthetic concept.
p40
aVThe industrial design magazine, I believe, is called "Innovation."
p41
aVInnovation is not part of the aim of my work.
p42
aVWell, makers of things: they make things more beautiful, more elegant,
p43
aVmore comfortable than just the craftsmen do.
p44
aVI have so much to say. I have to think what I am going to say.
p45
aVWell, to describe our profession otherwise,
p46
aVwe are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty.
p47
aVThat means the playful search for beauty was called the first activity of Man.
p48
aVSarah Smith, who was a mathematics professor at MIT, wrote,
p49
aV"The playful search for beauty was Man's first activity \u2014
p50
aVthat all useful qualities and all material qualities
p51
aVwere developed from the playful search for beauty."
p52
aVThese are tiles. The word, "playful" is a necessary aspect of our work
p53
aVbecause, actually, one of our problems is that we have to make,
p54
aVproduce, lovely things throughout all of life, and this for me is now 75 years.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo how can you, without drying up,
p57
aVmake things with the same pleasure, as a gift to others, for so long?
p58
aVThe playful is therefore an important part of our quality as designer.
p59
aVLet me tell you some about my life.
p60
aVAs I said, I started to do these things 75 years ago.
p61
aVMy first exhibition in the United States
p62
aVwas at the Sesquicentennial exhibition in 1926 \u2014
p63
aVthat the Hungarian government sent one of my hand-drawn pieces as part of the exhibit.
p64
aVMy work actually took me through many countries,
p65
aVand showed me a great part of the world.
p66
aVThis is not that they took me \u2014 the work didn't take me \u2014
p67
aVI made the things particularly because I wanted to use them to see the world.
p68
aVI was incredibly curious to see the world, and I made all these things,
p69
aVwhich then finally did take me to see many countries and many cultures.
p70
aVI started as an apprentice to a Hungarian craftsman,
p71
aVand this taught me what the guild system was in Middle Ages.
p72
aa(lp73
VThe guild system: that means when I was an apprentice,
p74
aVI had to apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master.
p75
aVIn my shop where I studied, or learned, there was a traditional hierarchy
p76
aVof master, journeyman and learned worker, and apprentice,
p77
aVand I worked as the apprentice.
p78
aVThe work as an apprentice was very primitive.
p79
aVThat means I had to actually learn every aspect of making pottery by hand.
p80
aVWe mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside.
p81
aVAfter that, it had to be kneaded. It had to then go in, kind of, a mangle.
p82
aVAnd then finally it was prepared for the throwing.
p83
aVAnd there I really worked as an apprentice.
p84
aVMy master took me to set ovens
p85
aVbecause this was part of oven-making, oven-setting, in the time.
p86
aVAnd finally, I had received a document
p87
aVthat I had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully,
p88
aVthat I had behaved morally, and this document was given to me
p89
aVby the Guild of Roof-Coverers, Rail-Diggers, Oven-Setters,
p90
aVChimney Sweeps and Potters.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VI also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights
p95
aVand my working conditions, and I still have that workbook.
p96
aVFirst I set up a shop in my own garden,
p97
aVand made pottery which I sold on the marketplace in Budapest.
p98
aVAnd there I was sitting, and my then-boyfriend \u2014
p99
aVI didn't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today \u2014
p100
aVbut my boyfriend and I sat at the market and sold the pots.
p101
aVMy mother thought that this was not very proper,
p102
aVso she sat with us to add propriety to this activity.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VHowever, after a while there was a new factory being built in Budapest,
p107
aVa pottery factory, a large one.
p108
aVAnd I visited it with several ladies, and asked all sorts of questions of the director.
p109
aVThen the director asked me, why do you ask all these questions?
p110
aVI said, I also have a pottery.
p111
aVSo he asked me, could he please visit me, and then finally he did,
p112
aVand explained to me that what I did now in my shop was an anachronism,
p113
aVthat the industrial revolution had broken out,
p114
aVand that I rather should join the factory.
p115
aVThere he made an art department for me where I worked for several months.
p116
aVHowever, everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department.
p117
aVThe director there said there were several women casting
p118
aVand producing my designs now in molds, and this was sold also to America.
p119
aa(lp120
VI remember that it was quite successful.
p121
aVHowever, the director, the chemist, model maker \u2014 everybody \u2014
p122
aVconcerned himself much more with the art department \u2014
p123
aVthat means, with my work \u2014 than making toilets,
p124
aVso finally they got a letter from the center, from the bank who owned the factory,
p125
aVsaying, make toilet-setting behind the art department, and that was my end.
p126
aVSo this gave me the possibility because now I was a journeyman,
p127
aVand journeymen also take their satchel and go to see the world.
p128
aVSo as a journeyman, I put an ad into the paper that I had studied,
p129
aVthat I was a down-to-earth potter's journeyman
p130
aVand I was looking for a job as a journeyman.
p131
aVAnd I got several answers, and I accepted the one
p132
aVwhich was farthest from home and practically, I thought, halfway to America.
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd that was in Hamburg.
p135
aVThen I first took this job in Hamburg, at an art pottery
p136
aVwhere everything was done on the wheel,
p137
aVand so I worked in a shop where there were several potters.
p138
aVAnd the first day, I was coming to take my place at the turntable \u2014
p139
aVthere were three or four turntables \u2014 and one of them, behind where I was sitting,
p140
aVwas a hunchback, a deaf-mute hunchback, who smelled very bad.
p141
aVSo I doused him in cologne every day, which he thought was very nice,
p142
aVand therefore he brought bread and butter every day,
p143
aVwhich I had to eat out of courtesy.
p144
aVThe first day I came to work in this shop
p145
aVthere was on my wheel a surprise for me.
p146
aVMy colleagues had thoughtfully put on the wheel where I was supposed to work
p147
aVa very nicely modeled natural man's organs.
p148
aV(Laughter)
p149
aVAfter I brushed them off with a hand motion, they were very \u2014
p150
aVI finally was now accepted, and worked there for some six months.
p151
aVThis was my first job.
p152
aVIf I go on like this, you will be here till midnight.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
V(Applause)
p157
aa(lp158
VSo I will try speed it up a little
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VModerator: Eva, we have about five minutes.
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VEva Zeisel: Are you sure?
p167
aa(lp168
VModerator: Yes, I am sure.
p169
aa(lp170
VEZ: Well, if you are sure,
p171
aVI have to tell you that within five minutes I will talk very fast.
p172
aVAnd actually, my work took me to many countries
p173
aVbecause I used my work to fill my curiosity.
p174
aVAnd among other things, other countries I worked, was in the Soviet Union,
p175
aVwhere I worked from '32 to '37 \u2014 actually, to '36.
p176
aVI was finally there, although I had nothing to do \u2014 I was a foreign expert.
p177
aVI became art director of the china and glass industry,
p178
aVand eventually under Stalin's purges \u2014 at the beginning of Stalin's purges,
p179
aVI didn't know that hundreds of thousands of innocent people were arrested.
p180
aVSo I was arrested quite early in Stalin's purges,
p181
aVand spent 16 months in a Russian prison.
p182
aVThe accusation was that I had successfully prepared an Attentat on Stalin's life.
p183
aVThis was a very dangerous accusation.
p184
aVAnd if this is the end of my five minutes, I want to tell you that
p185
aVI actually did survive, which was a surprise.
p186
aVBut since I survived and I'm here,
p187
aVand since this is the end of the five minutes, I will \u2014
p188
aa(lp189
VModerator: Tell me when your last trip to Russia was.
p190
aVWeren't you there recently?
p191
aa(lp192
VEZ: Oh, this summer, in fact,
p193
aVthe Lomonosov factory was bought by an American company, invited me.
p194
aVThey found out that I had worked in '33 at this factory,
p195
aVand they came to my studio in Rockland County,
p196
aVand brought the 15 of their artists to visit me here.
p197
aVAnd they invited myself to come to the Russian factory last summer,
p198
aVin July, to make some dishes, design some dishes.
p199
aVAnd since I don't like to travel alone, they also invited my daughter,
p200
aVson-in-law and granddaughter,
p201
aVso we had a lovely trip to see Russia today,
p202
aVwhich is not a very pleasant and happy view.
p203
aVHere I am now, if this is the end? Thank you.
