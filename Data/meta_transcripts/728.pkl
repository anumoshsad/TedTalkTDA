VI want you to put off your preconceptions,
p4
aVyour preconceived fears and thoughts about reptiles.
p5
aVBecause that is the only way I'm going to get my story across to you.
p6
aVAnd by the way, if I come across as a sort of
p7
aVrabid, hippie conservationist,
p8
aVit's purely a figment of your imagination.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VOkay. We are actually the first species on Earth
p12
aVto be so prolific to actually threaten our own survival.
p13
aVAnd I know we've all seen images enough to make us numb,
p14
aVof the tragedies that we're perpetrating on the planet.
p15
aVWe're kind of like greedy kids, using it all up, aren't we?
p16
aVAnd today is a time for me to talk to you about water.
p17
aVIt's not only because we like to drink lots of it,
p18
aVand its marvelous derivatives, beer, wine, etc.
p19
aVAnd, of course, watch it fall from the sky
p20
aVand flow in our wonderful rivers,
p21
aVbut for several other reasons as well.
p22
aa(lp23
VWhen I was a kid, growing up in New York,
p24
aVI was smitten by snakes, the same way most kids are
p25
aVsmitten by tops, marbles, cars, trains, cricket balls.
p26
aVAnd my mother, brave lady,
p27
aVwas partly to blame,
p28
aVtaking me to the New York Natural History Museum,
p29
aVbuying me books on snakes,
p30
aVand then starting this infamous career of mine,
p31
aVwhich has culminated in
p32
aVof course, arriving in India 60 years ago,
p33
aVbrought by my mother, Doris Norden,
p34
aVand my stepfather, Rama Chattopadhyaya.
p35
aa(lp36
VIt's been a roller coaster ride.
p37
aVTwo animals, two iconic reptiles
p38
aVreally captivated me very early on.
p39
aVOne of them was the remarkable gharial.
p40
aVThis crocodile, which grows to almost 20 feet long
p41
aVin the northern rivers,
p42
aVand this charismatic snake, the king cobra.
p43
aVWhat my purpose of the talk today really is,
p44
aVis to sort of indelibly scar your minds
p45
aVwith these charismatic and majestic creatures.
p46
aVBecause this is what you will take away from here,
p47
aVa reconnection with nature, I hope.
p48
aa(lp49
VThe king cobra is quite remarkable for several reasons.
p50
aVWhat you're seeing here is very recently shot images
p51
aVin a forest nearby here,
p52
aVof a female king cobra making her nest.
p53
aVHere is a limbless animal, capable of gathering a huge mound of leaves,
p54
aVand then laying her eggs inside,
p55
aVto withstand 5 to 10 [meters of rainfall],
p56
aVin order that the eggs can incubate over the next 90 days,
p57
aVand hatch into little baby king cobras.
p58
aVSo, she protects her eggs,
p59
aVand after three months,
p60
aVthe babies finally do hatch out.
p61
aVA majority of them will die, of course. There is very high mortality
p62
aVin little baby reptiles who are just 10 to 12 inches long.
p63
aa(lp64
VMy first experience with king cobras was in '72
p65
aVat a magical place called Agumbe,
p66
aVin Karnataka, this state.
p67
aVAnd it is a marvelous rain forest.
p68
aVThis first encounter
p69
aVwas kind of like the
p70
aVMaasai boy who kills the lion to become a warrior.
p71
aVIt really changed my life totally.
p72
aVAnd it brought me straight into the conservation fray.
p73
aVI ended up starting this research
p74
aVand education station in Agumbe,
p75
aVwhich you are all of course invited to visit.
p76
aa(lp77
VThis is basically a base wherein
p78
aVwe are trying to gather and learn
p79
aVvirtually everything about the biodiversity
p80
aVof this incredibly complex forest system,
p81
aVand try to hang on to what's there,
p82
aVmake sure the water sources are protected and kept clean,
p83
aVand of course, having a good time too.
p84
aVYou can almost hear the drums
p85
aVthrobbing back in that little cottage where we stay when we're there.
p86
aVIt was very important for us to get through to the people.
p87
aVAnd through the children is usually the way to go.
p88
aVThey are fascinated with snakes. They haven't got
p89
aVthat steely thing that you end up
p90
aVeither fearing or hating or despising or loathing them in some way.
p91
aVThey are interested.
p92
aVAnd it really works to start with them.
p93
aVThis gives you an idea of the size of some of these snakes.
p94
aa(lp95
VThis is an average size king cobra, about 12 feet long.
p96
aVAnd it actually crawled into somebody's bathroom,
p97
aVand was hanging around there for two or three days.
p98
aVThe people of this part of India
p99
aVworship the king cobra.
p100
aVAnd they didn't kill it. They called us to catch it.
p101
aVNow we've caught more than 100 king cobras
p102
aVover the last three years,
p103
aVand relocated them in nearby forests.
p104
aa(lp105
VBut in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures
p106
aV[it was necessary] for us to actually insert
p107
aVa small radio transmitter inside [each] snake.
p108
aVNow we are able to follow them and find out their secrets,
p109
aVwhere the babies go after they hatch,
p110
aVand remarkable things like this you're about to see.
p111
aVThis was just a few days ago in Agumbe.
p112
aVI had the pleasure of being close to this large king cobra
p113
aVwho had caught a venomous pit viper.
p114
aVAnd it does it in such a way that it doesn't get bitten itself.
p115
aVAnd king cobras feed only on snakes.
p116
aVThis [little snake] was kind of a tid-bit for it,
p117
aVwhat we'd call a "vadai" or a donut or something like that.
p118
aV(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VUsually they eat something a bit larger.
p121
aVIn this case a rather strange and inexplicable
p122
aVactivity happened over the last breeding season,
p123
aVwherein a large male king cobra actually grabbed a female king cobra,
p124
aVdidn't mate with it, actually killed it and swallowed it.
p125
aVWe're still trying to explain and come to terms with
p126
aVwhat is the evolutionary advantage of this.
p127
aa(lp128
VBut they do also a lot of other remarkable things.
p129
aVThis is again, something [we were able to see] by virtue of the fact
p130
aVthat we had a radio transmitter in one of the snakes.
p131
aVThis male snake, 12 feet long, met another male king cobra.
p132
aVAnd they did this incredible ritual combat dance.
p133
aVIt's very much like the rutting of mammals, including humans,
p134
aVyou know, sorting out our differences, but gentler, no biting allowed.
p135
aVIt's just a wresting match,
p136
aVbut a remarkable activity.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow, what are we doing with all this information?
p139
aVWhat's the point of all this?
p140
aVWell, the king cobra is literally
p141
aVa keystone species in these rainforests.
p142
aVAnd our job is to convince the authorities
p143
aVthat these forests have to be protected.
p144
aVAnd this is one of the ways we do it,
p145
aVby learning as much as we can
p146
aVabout something so remarkable and so iconic in the rainforests there,
p147
aVin order to help protect trees, animals
p148
aVand of course the water sources.
p149
aa(lp150
VYou've all heard, perhaps, of Project Tiger
p151
aVwhich started back in the early '70s,
p152
aVwhich was, in fact, a very dynamic time for conservation.
p153
aVWe were piloted, I could say,
p154
aVby a highly autocratic stateswoman,
p155
aVbut who also had an incredible passion for environment.
p156
aVAnd this is the time when Project Tiger emerged.
p157
aVAnd, just like Project Tiger,
p158
aVour activities with the king cobra
p159
aVis to look at a species of animal
p160
aVso that we protect its habitat and everything within it.
p161
aVSo, the tiger is the icon.
p162
aVAnd now the king cobra is a new one.
p163
aa(lp164
VAll the major rivers in south India
p165
aVare sourced in the Western Ghats,
p166
aVthe chain of hills running along the west coast of India.
p167
aVIt pours out millions of gallons every hour,
p168
aVand supplies drinking water to at least 300 million people,
p169
aVand washes many, many babies,
p170
aVand of course feeds many, many animals,
p171
aVboth domestic and wild,
p172
aVproduces thousands of tons of rice.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd what do we do? How do we respond to this?
p175
aVWell, basically, we dam it, we pollute it,
p176
aVwe pour in pesticides, weedicides, fungicides.
p177
aVYou drink it in peril of your life.
p178
aVAnd the thing is, it's not just big industry.
p179
aVIt's not misguided river engineers
p180
aVwho are doing all this; it's us.
p181
aVIt seems that our citizens find the best way to dispose of garbage
p182
aVare in water sources.
p183
aVOkay. Now we're going north, very far north.
p184
aa(lp185
VNorth central India, the Chambal River
p186
aVis where we have our base.
p187
aVThis is the home of the gharial, this incredible crocodile.
p188
aVIt is an animal which has been on the Earth
p189
aVfor just about 100 million years.
p190
aVIt survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off.
p191
aVIt has remarkable features.
p192
aVEven though it grows to 20 feet long,
p193
aVsince it eats only fish it's not dangerous to human beings.
p194
aVIt does have big teeth, however,
p195
aVand it's kind of hard to convince people
p196
aVif an animal has big teeth, that it's a harmless creature.
p197
aa(lp198
VBut we, actually, back in the early '70s,
p199
aVdid surveys,
p200
aVand found that gharial were extremely rare.
p201
aVIn fact, if you see the map,
p202
aVthe range of their original habitat
p203
aVwas all the way from the Indus in Pakistan
p204
aVto the Irrawaddy in Burma.
p205
aVAnd now it's just limited to a couple of spots
p206
aVin Nepal and India.
p207
aVSo, in fact at this point
p208
aVthere are only 200 breeding gharial left in the wild.
p209
aVSo, starting in the mid-'70s
p210
aVwhen conservation was at the fore,
p211
aVwe were actually able to start projects which were
p212
aVbasically government supported
p213
aVto collect eggs from the wild from the few remaining nests
p214
aVand release 5,000 baby gharial
p215
aVback to the wild.
p216
aVAnd pretty soon we were seeing sights like this.
p217
aVI mean, just incredible to see bunches of gharial
p218
aVbasking on the river again.
p219
aa(lp220
VBut complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt.
p221
aVAnd, sure enough, with all the other pressures on the river,
p222
aVlike sand mining, for example,
p223
aVvery, very heavy cultivation all the way down to the river's edge,
p224
aVnot allowing the animals to breed anymore,
p225
aVwe're looking at
p226
aVeven more problems building up for the gharial,
p227
aVdespite the early good intentions.
p228
aVTheir nests hatching along the riverside
p229
aVproducing hundreds of hatchlings. It's just an amazing sight.
p230
aVThis was actually just taken last year.
p231
aVBut then the monsoon arrives,
p232
aVand unfortunately downriver there is always a dam or
p233
aVthere is always a barrage,
p234
aVand, shoop, they get washed down to their doom.
p235
aa(lp236
VLuckily there is still a lot of interest.
p237
aVMy pals in the Crocodile Specialist Group of the IUCN,
p238
aVthe [Madras Crocodile Bank], an NGO,
p239
aVthe World Wildlife Fund,
p240
aVthe Wildlife Institute of India, State Forest Departments,
p241
aVand the Ministry of Environment, we all work together on stuff.
p242
aVBut it's possibly, and definitely not enough.
p243
aVFor example, in the winter of 2007 and 2008,
p244
aVthere was this incredible die-off of gharial, in the Chambal River.
p245
aVSuddenly dozens of gharial appearing on the river, dead.
p246
aVWhy? How could it happen?
p247
aa(lp248
VThis is a relatively clean river.
p249
aVThe Chambal, if you look at it, has clear water.
p250
aVPeople scoop water out of the Chambal and drink it,
p251
aVsomething you wouldn't do in most north Indian rivers.
p252
aVSo, in order to try to find out the answer to this,
p253
aVwe got veterinarians from all over the world
p254
aVworking with Indian vets to try to figure out what was happening.
p255
aVI was there for a lot of the necropsies on the riverside.
p256
aVAnd we actually looked through
p257
aVall their organs and tried to figure out what was going on.
p258
aVAnd it came down to something called gout,
p259
aVwhich, as a result of kidney breakdown
p260
aVis actually uric acid crystals throughout the body,
p261
aVand worse in the joints,
p262
aVwhich made the gharial unable to swim.
p263
aVAnd it's a horribly painful death.
p264
aa(lp265
VJust downriver from the Chambal is the
p266
aVfilthy Yamuna river, the sacred Yamuna river.
p267
aVAnd I hate to be so ironic and sarcastic about it
p268
aVbut it's the truth. It's just one of the filthiest cesspools you can imagine.
p269
aVIt flows down through Delhi, Mathura, Agra,
p270
aVand gets just about every bit of effluent you can imagine.
p271
aVSo, it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial
p272
aVwas something in the food chain,
p273
aVsomething in the fish they were eating.
p274
aVAnd, you know, once a toxin is in the food chain
p275
aVeverything is affected, including us.
p276
aa(lp277
VBecause these rivers are the lifeblood of people all along their course.
p278
aVIn order to try to answer some of these questions,
p279
aVwe again turn to technology,
p280
aVto biological technology, in this case,
p281
aVagain, telemetry, putting radios on 10 gharial,
p282
aVand actually following their movements. They're being watched
p283
aVeveryday as we speak, to try to find out
p284
aVwhat this mysterious toxin is.
p285
aa(lp286
VThe Chambal river is an absolutely incredible place.
p287
aVIt's a place that's famous to a lot of you who know
p288
aVabout the bandits, the dacoits
p289
aVwho used to work up there. And there still are quite a few around.
p290
aVBut Poolan Devi was one [of them]. Which actually Shekhar Kapur
p291
aVmade an incredible movie, "The Bandit Queen," which I urge you to see.
p292
aVYou'll get to see the incredible [Chambal] landscape as well.
p293
aa(lp294
VBut, again, heavy fishing pressures.
p295
aVThis is one of the last repositories of the
p296
aVGanges river dolphin,
p297
aVvarious species of turtles,
p298
aVthousands of migratory birds,
p299
aVand fishing is causing problems like this.
p300
aVAnd now [these] new elements of human intolerance
p301
aVfor river creatures like the gharial
p302
aVmeans that if they don't drown in the net,
p303
aVthen they simply cut their beaks off.
p304
aVAnimals like the Ganges river dolphin
p305
aVwhich is just down to a few left,
p306
aVand it is also critically endangered.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo, who is next? Us?
p309
aVBecause we are all dependent on these water sources.
p310
aVSo, we all know about the Narmada river,
p311
aVthe tragedies of dams, the tragedies of huge projects
p312
aVwhich displace people and wreck river systems
p313
aVwithout providing livelihoods.
p314
aVAnd development just basically going berserk,
p315
aVfor a double figure growth index, basically.
p316
aVSo, we're not sure where this story is going to end,
p317
aVwhether it's got a happy or sad ending.
p318
aVAnd climate change is certainly going
p319
aVto turn all of our theories and predictions on their heads.
p320
aVWe're still working hard at it.
p321
aVWe've got a lot of a good team of people working up there.
p322
aa(lp323
VAnd the thing is, you know, the decision makers,
p324
aVthe folks in power,
p325
aVthey're up in their bungalows and so on in Delhi,
p326
aVin the city capitals. They are all supplied with plenty of water. It's cool.
p327
aVBut out on the rivers there are still millions of people
p328
aVwho are in really bad shape.
p329
aVAnd it's a bleak future for them.
p330
aVSo, we have our Ganges and Yamuna cleanup project.
p331
aVWe've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it,
p332
aVand nothing to show for it. Incredible.
p333
aVSo, people talk about political will.
p334
aVDuring the die-off of the gharial we did galvanize a lot of action.
p335
aVGovernment cut through all the red tape,
p336
aVwe got foreign vets on it. It was great.
p337
aVSo, we can do it.
p338
aVBut if you stroll down to the Yamuna
p339
aVor to the Gomati in Lucknow,
p340
aVor to the Adyar river in Chennai,
p341
aVor the Mula-Mutha river in Pune,
p342
aVjust see what we're capable of doing to a river. It's sad.
p343
aa(lp344
VBut I think the final note really is
p345
aVthat we can do it.
p346
aVThe corporates, the artists, the wildlife nuts,
p347
aVthe good old everyday folks
p348
aVcan actually bring these rivers back.
p349
aVAnd the final word is
p350
aVthat there is a king cobra looking over our shoulders.
p351
aVAnd there is a gharial looking at us from the river.
p352
aVAnd these are powerful water totems.
p353
aVAnd they are going to disturb our dreams until we do the right thing.
p354
aVNamaste.
p355
aV(Applause)
p356
aa(lp357
VChris Anderson: Thanks, Rom. Thanks a lot.
p358
aVYou know, most people are terrified of snakes.
p359
aVAnd there might be quite a few people here who would be
p360
aVvery glad to see the last king cobra bite the dust.
p361
aVDo you have those conversations with people?
p362
aVHow do you really get them to care?
p363
aa(lp364
VRomulus Whitaker: I take the sort of humble approach,
p365
aVI guess you could say. I don't say that snakes are huggable exactly.
p366
aVIt's not like the teddy bear.
p367
aVBut I sort of \u2014 there is an innocence in these animals.
p368
aVAnd when the average person looks at a cobra
p369
aVgoing "Ssssss!" like that, they say, "My god,
p370
aVlook at that angry, dangerous creature."
p371
aVI look at it as a creature who is totally frightened
p372
aVof something so dangerous as a human being.
p373
aVAnd that is the truth. And that's what I try to get out.
p374
aV(Applause)
p375
aa(lp376
VCA: Now, incredible footage you showed of the viper being killed.
p377
aVYou were saying that that hasn't been filmed before.
p378
aa(lp379
VRW: Yes, this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it, for one thing.
p380
aVAs I said, it's just like a little snack for him, you know?
p381
aVUsually they eat larger snakes like rat snakes,
p382
aVor even cobras.
p383
aVBut this guy who we're following right now is in the deep jungle.
p384
aVWhereas other king cobras
p385
aVvery often come into the human interface,
p386
aVyou know, the plantations, to find big rat snakes and stuff.
p387
aVThis guy specializes in pit vipers.
p388
aVAnd the guy who is working there with them,
p389
aVhe's from Maharashtra, he said, "I think he's after the nusha."
p390
aV(Laughter)
p391
aVNow, the nusha means the high.
p392
aVWhenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush.
p393
aV(Laughter)
p394
aa(lp395
VCA: Thanks Rom. Thank you.
