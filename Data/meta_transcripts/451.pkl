VI wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation,
p4
aVsharing some of the problems.
p5
aVAnd Warren Buffet had recommended I do that \u2014
p6
aVbeing honest about what was going well, what wasn't,
p7
aVand making it kind of an annual thing.
p8
aVA goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems,
p9
aVbecause I think there are some very important problems
p10
aVthat don't get worked on naturally.
p11
aVThat is, the market does not drive the scientists,
p12
aVthe communicators, the thinkers, the governments
p13
aVto do the right things.
p14
aVAnd only by paying attention to these things
p15
aVand having brilliant people who care and draw other people in
p16
aVcan we make as much progress as we need to.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo this morning I'm going to share two of these problems
p19
aVand talk about where they stand.
p20
aVBut before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist.
p21
aVAny tough problem, I think it can be solved.
p22
aVAnd part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past.
p23
aVOver the past century, average lifespan has more than doubled.
p24
aVAnother statistic, perhaps my favorite,
p25
aVis to look at childhood deaths.
p26
aVAs recently as 1960, 110 million children were born,
p27
aVand 20 million of those died before the age of five.
p28
aVFive years ago, 135 million children were born \u2014 so, more \u2014
p29
aVand less than 10 million of them died before the age of five.
p30
aVSo that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate.
p31
aVIt's a phenomenal thing.
p32
aVEach one of those lives matters a lot.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes
p35
aVbut also a few key breakthroughs:
p36
aVvaccines that were used more widely.
p37
aVFor example, measles was four million of the deaths
p38
aVback as recently as 1990
p39
aVand now is under 400,000.
p40
aVSo we really can make changes.
p41
aVThe next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again.
p42
aVAnd I think that's doable in well under 20 years.
p43
aVWhy? Well there's only a few diseases
p44
aVthat account for the vast majority of those deaths:
p45
aVdiarrhea, pneumonia and malaria.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning,
p48
aVwhich is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos?
p49
aa(lp50
VWell, what's the history of this disease?
p51
aVIt's been a severe disease for thousands of years.
p52
aVIn fact, if we look at the genetic code,
p53
aVit's the only disease we can see
p54
aVthat people who lived in Africa
p55
aVactually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths.
p56
aVDeaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s.
p57
aVSo it was absolutely gigantic.
p58
aVAnd the disease was all over the world.
p59
aVA terrible disease. It was in the United States. It was in Europe.
p60
aVPeople didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s,
p61
aVwhen a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos.
p62
aVSo it was everywhere.
p63
aVAnd two tools helped bring the death rate down.
p64
aVOne was killing the mosquitos with DDT.
p65
aVThe other was treating the patients with quinine, or quinine derivatives.
p66
aVAnd so that's why the death rate did come down.
p67
aa(lp68
VNow, ironically, what happened was
p69
aVit was eliminated from all the temperate zones,
p70
aVwhich is where the rich countries are.
p71
aVSo we can see: 1900, it's everywhere.
p72
aV1945, it's still most places.
p73
aV1970, the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.
p74
aV1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas.
p75
aVAnd more recently you can see it's just around the equator.
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd so this leads to the paradox that
p78
aVbecause the disease is only in the poorer countries,
p79
aVit doesn't get much investment.
p80
aVFor example, there's more money put into baldness drugs
p81
aVthan are put into malaria.
p82
aVNow, baldness, it's a terrible thing.
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVAnd rich men are afflicted.
p85
aVAnd so that's why that priority has been set.
p86
aa(lp87
VBut, malaria \u2014
p88
aVeven the million deaths a year caused by malaria
p89
aVgreatly understate its impact.
p90
aVOver 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it.
p91
aVIt means that you can't get the economies in these areas going
p92
aVbecause it just holds things back so much.
p93
aVNow, malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos.
p94
aVI brought some here, just so you could experience this.
p95
aVWe'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVThere's no reason only poor people should have the experience.
p98
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p99
aVThose mosquitos are not infected.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo we've come up with a few new things. We've got bed nets.
p102
aVAnd bed nets are a great tool.
p103
aVWhat it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night,
p104
aVso the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them.
p105
aVAnd when you use indoor spraying with DDT
p106
aVand those nets
p107
aVyou can cut deaths by over 50 percent.
p108
aVAnd that's happened now in a number of countries.
p109
aVIt's great to see.
p110
aa(lp111
VBut we have to be careful because malaria \u2014
p112
aVthe parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves.
p113
aVSo every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective.
p114
aVAnd so you end up with two choices.
p115
aVIf you go into a country with the right tools and the right way,
p116
aVyou do it vigorously,
p117
aVyou can actually get a local eradication.
p118
aVAnd that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking.
p119
aVOr, if you go in kind of half-heartedly,
p120
aVfor a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden,
p121
aVbut eventually those tools will become ineffective,
p122
aVand the death rate will soar back up again.
p123
aVAnd the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention.
p124
aa(lp125
VNow we're on the upswing.
p126
aVBed net funding is up.
p127
aVThere's new drug discovery going on.
p128
aVOur foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial
p129
aVthat starts in a couple months.
p130
aVAnd that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective.
p131
aVSo we're going to have these new tools.
p132
aa(lp133
VBut that alone doesn't give us the road map.
p134
aVBecause the road map to get rid of this disease
p135
aVinvolves many things.
p136
aVIt involves communicators to keep the funding high,
p137
aVto keep the visibility high,
p138
aVto tell the success stories.
p139
aVIt involves social scientists,
p140
aVso we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets,
p141
aVbut 90 percent.
p142
aVWe need mathematicians to come in and simulate this,
p143
aVto do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together.
p144
aVOf course we need drug companies to give us their expertise.
p145
aVWe need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things.
p146
aVAnd so as these elements come together,
p147
aVI'm quite optimistic
p148
aVthat we will be able to eradicate malaria.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow let me turn to a second question,
p151
aVa fairly different question, but I'd say equally important.
p152
aVAnd this is: How do you make a teacher great?
p153
aVIt seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on,
p154
aVand we'd understand very well.
p155
aVAnd the answer is, really, that we don't.
p156
aVLet's start with why this is important.
p157
aVWell, all of us here, I'll bet, had some great teachers.
p158
aVWe all had a wonderful education.
p159
aVThat's part of the reason we're here today,
p160
aVpart of the reason we're successful.
p161
aVI can say that, even though I'm a college drop-out.
p162
aVI had great teachers.
p163
aa(lp164
VIn fact, in the United States, the teaching system has worked fairly well.
p165
aVThere are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places.
p166
aVSo the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education.
p167
aVAnd those top 20 percent have been the best in the world,
p168
aVif you measure them against the other top 20 percent.
p169
aVAnd they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology
p170
aVand keep the U.S. at the forefront.
p171
aa(lp172
VNow, the strength for those top 20 percent
p173
aVis starting to fade on a relative basis,
p174
aVbut even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting.
p175
aVNot only has that been weak. it's getting weaker.
p176
aVAnd if you look at the economy, it really is only providing opportunities now
p177
aVto people with a better education.
p178
aVAnd we have to change this.
p179
aVWe have to change it so that people have equal opportunity.
p180
aVWe have to change it so that the country is strong
p181
aVand stays at the forefront
p182
aVof things that are driven by advanced education,
p183
aVlike science and mathematics.
p184
aa(lp185
VWhen I first learned the statistics,
p186
aVI was pretty stunned at how bad things are.
p187
aVOver 30 percent of kids never finish high school.
p188
aVAnd that had been covered up for a long time
p189
aVbecause they always took the dropout rate as the number
p190
aVwho started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year.
p191
aVBecause they weren't tracking where the kids were before that.
p192
aVBut most of the dropouts had taken place before that.
p193
aVThey had to raise the stated dropout rate
p194
aVas soon as that tracking was done
p195
aVto over 30 percent.
p196
aVFor minority kids, it's over 50 percent.
p197
aVAnd even if you graduate from high school,
p198
aVif you're low-income,
p199
aVyou have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree.
p200
aVIf you're low-income in the United States,
p201
aVyou have a higher chance of going to jail
p202
aVthan you do of getting a four-year degree.
p203
aVAnd that doesn't seem entirely fair.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo, how do you make education better?
p206
aa(lp207
VNow, our foundation, for the last nine years, has invested in this.
p208
aVThere's many people working on it.
p209
aVWe've worked on small schools,
p210
aVwe've funded scholarships,
p211
aVwe've done things in libraries.
p212
aVA lot of these things had a good effect.
p213
aVBut the more we looked at it, the more we realized that having great teachers
p214
aVwas the very key thing.
p215
aVAnd we hooked up with some people studying
p216
aVhow much variation is there between teachers,
p217
aVbetween, say, the top quartile \u2014 the very best \u2014
p218
aVand the bottom quartile.
p219
aVHow much variation is there within a school or between schools?
p220
aVAnd the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable.
p221
aVA top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class \u2014
p222
aVbased on test scores \u2014
p223
aVby over 10 percent in a single year.
p224
aVWhat does that mean?
p225
aVThat means that if the entire U.S., for two years,
p226
aVhad top quartile teachers,
p227
aVthe entire difference between us and Asia would go away.
p228
aVWithin four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo, it's simple. All you need are those top quartile teachers.
p231
aVAnd so you'd say, "Wow, we should reward those people.
p232
aVWe should retain those people.
p233
aVWe should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people."
p234
aVBut I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today.
p235
aa(lp236
VWhat are the characteristics of this top quartile?
p237
aVWhat do they look like?
p238
aVYou might think these must be very senior teachers.
p239
aVAnd the answer is no.
p240
aVOnce somebody has taught for three years
p241
aVtheir teaching quality does not change thereafter.
p242
aVThe variation is very, very small.
p243
aVYou might think these are people with master's degrees.
p244
aVThey've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education.
p245
aVThis chart takes four different factors
p246
aVand says how much do they explain teaching quality.
p247
aVThat bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all,
p248
aVis a master's degree.
p249
aa(lp250
VNow, the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded.
p251
aVOne is seniority.
p252
aVBecause your pay goes up and you vest into your pension.
p253
aVThe second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree.
p254
aVBut it in no way is associated with being a better teacher.
p255
aVTeach for America: slight effect.
p256
aVFor math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect.
p257
aVBut, overwhelmingly, it's your past performance.
p258
aVThere are some people who are very good at this.
p259
aVAnd we've done almost nothing
p260
aVto study what that is
p261
aVand to draw it in and to replicate it,
p262
aVto raise the average capability \u2014
p263
aVor to encourage the people with it to stay in the system.
p264
aa(lp265
VYou might say, "Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave?"
p266
aVThe answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.
p267
aVAnd it's a system with very high turnover.
p268
aa(lp269
VNow, there are a few places \u2014 very few \u2014 where great teachers are being made.
p270
aVA good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP.
p271
aVKIPP means Knowledge Is Power.
p272
aVIt's an unbelievable thing.
p273
aVThey have 66 schools \u2014 mostly middle schools, some high schools \u2014
p274
aVand what goes on is great teaching.
p275
aVThey take the poorest kids,
p276
aVand over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges.
p277
aVAnd the whole spirit and attitude in those schools
p278
aVis very different than in the normal public schools.
p279
aVThey're team teaching. They're constantly improving their teachers.
p280
aVThey're taking data, the test scores,
p281
aVand saying to a teacher, "Hey, you caused this amount of increase."
p282
aVThey're deeply engaged in making teaching better.
p283
aa(lp284
VWhen you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms,
p285
aVat first it's very bizarre.
p286
aVI sat down and I thought, "What is going on?"
p287
aVThe teacher was running around, and the energy level was high.
p288
aVI thought, "I'm in the sports rally or something.
p289
aVWhat's going on?"
p290
aVAnd the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention,
p291
aVwhich kids were bored,
p292
aVand calling kids rapidly, putting things up on the board.
p293
aVIt was a very dynamic environment,
p294
aVbecause particularly in those middle school years \u2014 fifth through eighth grade \u2014
p295
aVkeeping people engaged and setting the tone
p296
aVthat everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention,
p297
aVnobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there.
p298
aVEverybody needs to be involved.
p299
aVAnd so KIPP is doing it.
p300
aa(lp301
VHow does that compare to a normal school?
p302
aVWell, in a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they are.
p303
aVThe data isn't gathered.
p304
aVIn the teacher's contract,
p305
aVit will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom \u2014
p306
aVsometimes to once per year.
p307
aVAnd they need advanced notice to do that.
p308
aVSo imagine running a factory where you've got these workers,
p309
aVsome of them just making crap
p310
aVand the management is told, "Hey, you can only come down here once a year,
p311
aVbut you need to let us know, because we might actually fool you,
p312
aVand try and do a good job in that one brief moment."
p313
aa(lp314
VEven a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it.
p315
aVThey don't have the test scores,
p316
aVand there's a whole thing of trying to block the data.
p317
aVFor example, New York passed a law
p318
aVthat said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used
p319
aVin the tenure decision for the teachers.
p320
aVAnd so that's sort of working in the opposite direction.
p321
aVBut I'm optimistic about this,
p322
aVI think there are some clear things we can do.
p323
aa(lp324
VFirst of all, there's a lot more testing going on,
p325
aVand that's given us the picture of where we are.
p326
aVAnd that allows us to understand who's doing it well,
p327
aVand call them out, and find out what those techniques are.
p328
aVOf course, digital video is cheap now.
p329
aVPutting a few cameras in the classroom
p330
aVand saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis
p331
aVis very practical in all public schools.
p332
aVAnd so every few weeks teachers could sit down
p333
aVand say, "OK, here's a little clip of something I thought I did well.
p334
aVHere's a little clip of something I think I did poorly.
p335
aVAdvise me \u2014 when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that?"
p336
aVAnd they could all sit and work together on those problems.
p337
aVYou can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it,
p338
aVhave it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff.
p339
aa(lp340
VYou can take those great courses and make them available
p341
aVso that a kid could go out and watch the physics course, learn from that.
p342
aVIf you have a kid who's behind,
p343
aVyou would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept.
p344
aVAnd in fact, these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet,
p345
aVbut you could make it so that DVDs were always available,
p346
aVand so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers.
p347
aVAnd so by thinking of this as a personnel system,
p348
aVwe can do it much better.
p349
aa(lp350
VNow there's a book actually, about KIPP \u2014
p351
aVthe place that this is going on \u2014
p352
aVthat Jay Matthews, a news reporter, wrote \u2014 called, "Work Hard, Be Nice."
p353
aVAnd I thought it was so fantastic.
p354
aVIt gave you a sense of what a good teacher does.
p355
aVI'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book.
p356
aV(Applause)
p357
aa(lp358
VNow, we put a lot of money into education,
p359
aVand I really think that education is the most important thing to get right
p360
aVfor the country to have as strong a future as it should have.
p361
aVIn fact we have in the stimulus bill \u2014 it's interesting \u2014
p362
aVthe House version actually had money in it for these data systems,
p363
aVand it was taken out in the Senate
p364
aVbecause there are people who are threatened by these things.
p365
aa(lp366
VBut I \u2014 I'm optimistic.
p367
aVI think people are beginning to recognize how important this is,
p368
aVand it really can make a difference for millions of lives, if we get it right.
p369
aVI only had time to frame those two problems.
p370
aVThere's a lot more problems like that \u2014
p371
aVAIDS, pneumonia \u2014 I can just see you're getting excited,
p372
aVjust at the very name of these things.
p373
aVAnd the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad.
p374
aVYou know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen.
p375
aVGovernments don't naturally pick these things in the right way.
p376
aVThe private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things.
p377
aa(lp378
VSo it's going to take brilliant people like you
p379
aVto study these things, get other people involved \u2014
p380
aVand you're helping to come up with solutions.
p381
aVAnd with that, I think there's some great things that will come out of it.
p382
aa(lp383
VThank you.
