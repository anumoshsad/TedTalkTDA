VWhat do we know about the future?
p4
aVDifficult question, simple answer: nothing.
p5
aVWe cannot predict the future.
p6
aVWe only can create a vision of the future, how it might be,
p7
aVa vision which reveals disruptive ideas, which is inspiring,
p8
aVand this is the most important reason
p9
aVwhich breaks the chains of common thinking.
p10
aVThere are a lot of people
p11
aVwho created their own vision about the future,
p12
aVfor instance, this vision here from the early 20th century.
p13
aVIt says here that this is the ocean plane of the future.
p14
aVIt takes only one and a half days to cross the Atlantic Ocean.
p15
aVToday, we know that this future vision didn't come true.
p16
aVSo this is our largest airplane which we have,
p17
aVthe Airbus A380, and it's quite huge,
p18
aVso a lot of people fit in there
p19
aVand it's technically completely different
p20
aVthan the vision I've shown to you.
p21
aVI'm working in a team with Airbus,
p22
aVand we have created our vision
p23
aVabout a more sustainable future of aviation.
p24
aVSo sustainability is quite important for us,
p25
aVwhich should incorporate social
p26
aVbut as well as environmental and economic values.
p27
aVSo we have created a very disruptive structure
p28
aVwhich mimics the design of bone, or a skeleton,
p29
aVwhich occurs in nature.
p30
aVSo that's why it looks maybe a little bit weird,
p31
aVespecially to the people who deal with structures in general.
p32
aVBut at least it's just a kind of artwork
p33
aVto explore our ideas about a different future.
p34
aVWhat are the main customers of the future?
p35
aVSo, we have the old, we have the young,
p36
aVwe have the uprising power of women,
p37
aVand there's one mega-trend which affects all of us.
p38
aVThese are the future anthropometrics.
p39
aVSo our children are getting larger, but at the same time
p40
aVwe are growing into different directions.
p41
aVSo what we need is space inside the aircraft,
p42
aVinside a very dense area.
p43
aVThese people have different needs.
p44
aVSo we see a clear need of active health promotion,
p45
aVespecially in the case of the old people.
p46
aVWe want to be treated as individuals.
p47
aVWe like to be productive throughout the entire travel chain,
p48
aVand what we are doing in the future is
p49
aVwe want to use the latest man-machine interface,
p50
aVand we want to integrate this and show this in one product.
p51
aVSo we combined these needs with technology's themes.
p52
aVSo for instance, we are asking ourselves,
p53
aVhow can we create more light?
p54
aVHow can we bring more natural light into the airplane?
p55
aVSo this airplane has no windows anymore, for example.
p56
aVWhat about the data and communication software
p57
aVwhich we need in the future?
p58
aVMy belief is that the airplane of the future
p59
aVwill get its own consciousness.
p60
aVIt will be more like a living organism
p61
aVthan just a collection of very complex technology.
p62
aVThis will be very different in the future.
p63
aVIt will communicate directly
p64
aVwith the passenger in its environment.
p65
aVAnd then we are talking also about materials,
p66
aVsynthetic biology, for example.
p67
aVAnd my belief is that we will get more and more
p68
aVnew materials which we can put into structure later on,
p69
aVbecause structure is one of the key issues in aircraft design.
p70
aVSo let's compare the old world with the new world.
p71
aVI just want to show you here what we are doing today.
p72
aVSo this is a bracket of an A380 crew rest compartment.
p73
aVIt takes a lot of weight,
p74
aVand it follows the classical design rules.
p75
aVThis here is an equal bracket for the same purpose.
p76
aVIt follows the design of bone.
p77
aVThe design process is completely different.
p78
aVAt the one hand, we have 1.2 kilos,
p79
aVand at the other hand 0.6 kilos.
p80
aVSo this technology, 3D printing, and new design rules
p81
aVreally help us to reduce the weight,
p82
aVwhich is the biggest issue in aircraft design,
p83
aVbecause it's directly linked to greenhouse gas emissions.
p84
aVPush this idea a little bit forward.
p85
aVSo how does nature build its components and structures?
p86
aVSo nature is very clever. It puts all the information
p87
aVinto these small building blocks, which we call DNA.
p88
aVAnd nature builds large skeletons out of it.
p89
aVSo we see a bottom-up approach here,
p90
aVbecause all the information, as I said, are inside the DNA.
p91
aVAnd this is combined with a top-down approach,
p92
aVbecause what we are doing in our daily life
p93
aVis we train our muscles, we train our skeleton,
p94
aVand it's getting stronger.
p95
aVAnd the same approach can be applied to technology as well.
p96
aVSo our building block is carbon nanotubes, for example,
p97
aVto create a large, rivet-less skeleton at the end of the day.
p98
aVHow this looks in particular, you can show it here.
p99
aVSo imagine you have carbon nanotubes growing
p100
aVinside a 3D printer,
p101
aVand they are embedded inside a matrix of plastic,
p102
aVand follow the forces which occur in your component.
p103
aVAnd you've got trillions of them.
p104
aVSo you really align them to wood,
p105
aVand you take this wood and make morphological optimization,
p106
aVso you make structures, sub-structures,
p107
aVwhich allows you to transmit electrical energy or data.
p108
aVAnd now we take this material, combine this
p109
aVwith a top-down approach,
p110
aVand build bigger and bigger components.
p111
aVSo how might the airplane of the future look?
p112
aVSo we have very different seats which adapt
p113
aVto the shape of the future passenger,
p114
aVwith the different anthropometrics.
p115
aVWe have social areas inside the aircraft
p116
aVwhich might turn into a place
p117
aVwhere you can play virtual golf.
p118
aVAnd finally, this bionic structure,
p119
aVwhich is covered by a transparent
p120
aVbiopolymer membrane, will really change radically
p121
aVhow we look at aircrafts in the future.
p122
aVSo as Jason Silva said,
p123
aVif we can imagine it, why not make it so?
p124
aVSee you in the future. Thank you.
