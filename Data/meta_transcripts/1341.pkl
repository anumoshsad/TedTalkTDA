VI want to talk to you about,
p4
aVor share with you, a breakthrough new approach
p5
aVfor managing items of inventory inside of a warehouse.
p6
aVWe're talking about a pick, pack and ship setting here.
p7
aa(lp8
VSo as a hint,
p9
aVthis solution involves hundreds of mobile robots,
p10
aVsometimes thousands of mobile robots,
p11
aVmoving around a warehouse. And I'll get to the solution.
p12
aVBut for a moment, just think
p13
aVabout the last time that you ordered something online.
p14
aVYou were sitting on your couch
p15
aVand you decided that you absolutely had to have this red t-shirt.
p16
aVSo \u2014 click! \u2014 you put it into your shopping cart.
p17
aVAnd then you decided that green pair of pants
p18
aVlooks pretty good too \u2014 click!
p19
aVAnd maybe a blue pair of shoes \u2014 click!
p20
aVSo at this point you've assembled your order.
p21
aVYou didn't stop to think  for a moment that
p22
aVthat might not be a great outfit.
p23
aVBut you hit "submit order."
p24
aVAnd two days later, this package shows up on your doorstep.
p25
aVAnd you open the box and you're like, wow, there's my goo.
p26
aa(lp27
VDid you ever stop to think about how those items of inventory
p28
aVactually found their way inside that box in the warehouse?
p29
aVSo I'm here to tell you  it's that guy right there.
p30
aVSo deep in the middle of that picture,
p31
aVyou see a classic pick-pack worker
p32
aVin a distribution or order fulfillments setting.
p33
aVClassically these pick workers will  spend 60 or 70 percent of their day
p34
aVwandering around the warehouse.
p35
aVThey'll often walk as much as 5 or 10 miles
p36
aVin pursuit of those items of inventory.
p37
aVNot only is this an unproductive way to fill orders,
p38
aVit also turns out to be an unfulfilling way to fill orders.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo let me tell you where I first bumped into this problem.
p41
aVI was out in the Bay area  in '99, 2000, the dot com boom.
p42
aVI worked for a fabulously spectacular flame-out called Webvan.
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aVThis company raised hundreds of millions of dollars with the notion that
p45
aVwe will deliver grocery orders online.
p46
aVAnd it really came down to the fact that we couldn't do it cost effectively.
p47
aVTurns out e-commerce was something that was very hard and very costly.
p48
aVIn this particular instance we were trying to assemble 30 items of inventory
p49
aVinto a few totes, onto a van to deliver to the home.
p50
aVAnd when you think about it, it was costing us 30 dollars.
p51
aVImagine, we had an 89¢ can of soup
p52
aVthat was costing us one dollar to pick and pack into that tote.
p53
aVAnd that's before we actually tried to deliver it to the home.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo long story short, during my one year at Webvan,
p56
aVwhat I realized by talking to  all the material-handling providers
p57
aVwas that there was no solution designed specifically to solve each base picking.
p58
aVRed item, green, blue, getting those three things in a box.
p59
aVSo we said, there's just got to be a better way to do this.
p60
aVExisting material handling was set up to pump
p61
aVpallets and cases of goo to retail stores.
p62
aa(lp63
VOf course Webvan went out of business, and about a year and a half later,
p64
aVI was still noodling on this problem. It was still nagging at me.
p65
aVAnd I started thinking about it again.
p66
aVAnd I said, let me just focus briefly on what I wanted as a pick worker,
p67
aVor my vision for how it should work.
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aVI said, let's focus on the problem.
p70
aVI have an order here and what I want to do is I want to put
p71
aVred, green and blue in this box right here.
p72
aVWhat I need is a system where I put out my hand and \u2014 poof! \u2014
p73
aVthe product shows up  and I pack it into the order,
p74
aVand now we're thinking,
p75
aVthis would be a very operator-centric approach to solving the problem.
p76
aVThis is what I need. What technology is available to solve this problem?
p77
aVBut as you can see, orders can come and go, products can come and go.
p78
aVIt allows us to focus on making the pick worker the center of the problem,
p79
aVand providing them the tools to make them as productive as possible.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo how did I arrive at this notion?
p82
aVWell, actually it came from a brainstorming exercise,
p83
aVprobably a technique that many of you use,
p84
aVIt's this notion of testing your ideas.
p85
aVTake a blank sheet, of course,
p86
aVbut then test your ideas at the limits \u2014 infinity, zero.
p87
aVIn this particular case, we challenged ourselves with the idea:
p88
aVWhat if we had to build a distribution center in China,
p89
aVwhere it's a very, very low-cost market?
p90
aVAnd say, labor is cheap, land is cheap.
p91
aVAnd we said specifically,
p92
aV"What if it was zero dollars an hour for direct labor
p93
aVand we could build a million- square-foot distribution center?"
p94
aVSo naturally that led to ideas that said,
p95
aV"Let's put lots of people in the warehouse."
p96
aVAnd I said, "Hold on, zero dollars per hour,
p97
aVwhat I would do is 'hire'
p98
aV10,000 workers to come to the warehouse every morning at 8 a.m.,
p99
aVwalk into the warehouse and pick up one item of inventory
p100
aVand then just stand there.
p101
aVSo you hold Captain Crunch, you hold the Mountain Dew,
p102
aVyou hold the Diet Coke.
p103
aVIf I need it, I'll call you, otherwise just stand there.
p104
aVBut when I need Diet Coke and I call it, you guys talk amongst yourselves.
p105
aVDiet Coke walks up to the front \u2014 pick it, put it in the tote, away it goes."
p106
aVWow, what if the products could walk and talk on their own?
p107
aVThat's a very interesting, very powerful way
p108
aVthat we could potentially organize this warehouse.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo of course, labor isn't free,
p111
aVon that practical versus awesome spectrum.
p112
aV(Laughter)
p113
aVSo we said mobile shelving \u2014 We'll put them on mobile shelving.
p114
aVWe'll use mobile robots and we'll move the inventory around.
p115
aVAnd so we got underway on that and then I'm sitting on my couch in 2008.
p116
aVDid any of you see the Beijing Olympics, the opening ceremonies?
p117
aVI about fell out of my couch when I saw this.
p118
aVI'm like, that was the idea!
p119
aV(Laughter and Applause)
p120
aVWe'll put thousands of people on the warehouse floor, the stadium floor.
p121
aVBut interestingly enough, this actually relates to the idea
p122
aVin that these guys were creating some incredibly powerful, impressive digital art,
p123
aVall without computers, I'm told,
p124
aVit was all peer-to-peer coordination and communication.
p125
aVYou stand up, I'll squat down.
p126
aVAnd they made some fabulous art.
p127
aVIt speaks to the power of emergence
p128
aVin systems when you let things start to talk with each other.
p129
aVSo that was a little bit of the journey.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo of course, now what became the practical reality of this idea?
p132
aVHere is a warehouse.
p133
aVIt's a pick, pack and ship center that has about 10,000 different SKUs.
p134
aVWe'll call them red pens, green pens, yellow Post-It Notes.
p135
aVWe send the little orange robots out to pick up the blue shelving pods.
p136
aVAnd we deliver them to the side of the building.
p137
aVSo all the pick workers now get to stay on the perimeter.
p138
aVAnd the game here is to pick up the shelves,
p139
aVtake them down the highway and deliver them straight to the pick worker.
p140
aVThis pick worker's life is completely different.
p141
aVRather than wandering around the warehouse, she gets to stay still
p142
aVin a pick station like this
p143
aVand every product in the building can now come to her.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo the process is very productive.
p146
aVReach in, pick an item, scan the bar code, pack it out.
p147
aVBy the time you turn around,
p148
aVthere's another product there ready to be picked and packed.
p149
aVSo what we've done is take out all of the non-value added
p150
aVwalking, searching, wasting, waited time,
p151
aVand we've developed a very  high-fidelity way to pick these orders,
p152
aVwhere you point at it with a laser, scan the UPC barcode,
p153
aVand then indicate with a light which box it needs to go into.
p154
aVSo more productive, more accurate and, it turns out,
p155
aVit's a more interesting office environment for these pick workers.
p156
aVThey actually complete the whole order.
p157
aVSo they do red, green and blue, not just a part of the order.
p158
aVAnd they feel a little bit more in control of their environment.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo the side effects of this approach
p161
aVare what really surprised us.
p162
aVWe knew it was going  to be more productive.
p163
aVBut we didn't realize just how pervasive this way of thinking
p164
aVextended to other functions in the warehouse.
p165
aVBut what effectively this approach is doing inside of the DC
p166
aVis turning it into a massively parallel processing engine.
p167
aVSo this is again a cross-fertilization of ideas.
p168
aVHere's a warehouse and we're thinking about
p169
aVparallel processing supercomputer architectures.
p170
aVThe notion here is that you have
p171
aV10 workers on  the right side of the screen
p172
aVthat are now all independent autonomous pick workers.
p173
aVIf the worker in station three decides to leave and go to the bathroom,
p174
aVit has no impact on the productivity of the other nine workers.
p175
aVContrast that, for a moment, with the traditional method of using a conveyor.
p176
aVWhen one person passes the order to you,
p177
aVyou put something in and pass it downstream.
p178
aVEveryone has to be in place for that serial process to work.
p179
aVThis becomes a more robust way to think about the warehouse.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd then underneath the hoods gets interesting in that we're tracking
p182
aVthe popularity of the products.
p183
aVAnd we're using dynamic and adaptive algorithms
p184
aVto tune the floor of the warehouse.
p185
aVSo what you see here potentially the week leading up to Valentine's Day.
p186
aVAll that pink chalky candy has moved to the front of the building
p187
aVand is now being picked into a lot of orders in those pick stations.
p188
aVCome in two days after Valentine's Day, and that candy, the leftover candy,
p189
aVhas all drifted to the back of the warehouse
p190
aVand is occupying the cooler zone on the thermal map there.
p191
aVOne other side effect of this approach using the parallel processing
p192
aVis these things can scale to ginormous.
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aVSo whether you're doing two pick stations, 20 pick stations,
p195
aVor 200 pick stations, the path planning algorithms
p196
aVand all of the inventory algorithms just work.
p197
aVIn this example you see that the inventory
p198
aVhas now occupied all the perimeter of the building
p199
aVbecause that's where the pick stations were.
p200
aVThey sorted it out for themselves.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo I'll conclude with just one final video
p203
aVthat shows how this comes to bear
p204
aVon the pick worker's actual day in the life of.
p205
aVSo as we mentioned, the process is to move inventory along the highway
p206
aVand then find your way into these pick stations.
p207
aVAnd our software in the background
p208
aVunderstands what's going on  in each station,
p209
aVwe direct the pods across the highway
p210
aVand we're attempting to get into a queuing system
p211
aVto present the work to the pick worker.
p212
aVWhat's interesting is we can even adapt the speed of the pick workers.
p213
aVThe faster pickers get more pods and the slower pickers get few.
p214
aVBut this pick worker now is literally having that experience
p215
aVthat we described before.
p216
aVShe puts out her hand. The product jumps into it.
p217
aVOr she has to reach in and get it.
p218
aVShe scans it and  she puts it in the bucket.
p219
aVAnd all of the rest of the technology is kind of behind the scenes.
p220
aVSo she gets to now focus on the picking and packing portion of her job.
p221
aVNever has any idle time, never has to leave her mat.
p222
aVAnd actually we think not only a more productive
p223
aVand more accurate way to fill orders.
p224
aVWe think it's a more fulfilling way to fill orders.
p225
aa(lp226
VThe reason we can say that, though, is that workers
p227
aVin a lot of these buildings now compete
p228
aVfor the privilege of working in the Kiva zone that day.
p229
aVAnd sometimes we'll catch them on testimonial videos
p230
aVsaying such things as,
p231
aVthey have more energy after the day to play with their grandchildren,
p232
aVor in one case a guy said, "the Kiva zone is so stress-free
p233
aVthat I've actually stopped taking my blood pressure medication."
p234
aV(Laughter)
p235
aVThat was at a pharmaceutical distributor, so they told us not to use that video.
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VSo what I wanted to leave you with today is the notion that
p239
aVwhen you let things start to think and walk
p240
aVand talk on their own, interesting processes and productivities can emerge.
p241
aVAnd now I think next time you go to your front step
p242
aVand pick up that box that you just ordered online,
p243
aVyou break it open and the goo is in there,
p244
aVyou'll have some wonderment as to whether a robot
p245
aVassisted in the picking and packing of that order.
p246
aa(lp247
VThank you.
