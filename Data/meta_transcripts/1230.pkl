VSo I just want to tell you my story.
p4
aVI spend a lot of time
p5
aVteaching adults how to use visual language
p6
aVand doodling in the workplace.
p7
aVAnd naturally, I encounter a lot of resistance,
p8
aVbecause it's considered to be anti-intellectual
p9
aVand counter to serious learning.
p10
aVBut I have a problem with that belief,
p11
aVbecause I know that doodling has a profound impact
p12
aVon the way that we can process information
p13
aVand the way that we can solve problems.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo I was curious about why there was a disconnect
p16
aVbetween the way our society perceives doodling
p17
aVand the way that the reality is.
p18
aVSo I discovered some very interesting things.
p19
aVFor example, there's no such thing
p20
aVas a flattering definition of a doodle.
p21
aVIn the 17th century, a doodle was a simpleton or a fool \u2014
p22
aVas in Yankee Doodle.
p23
aVIn the 18th century, it became a verb,
p24
aVand it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone.
p25
aVIn the 19th century, it was a corrupt politician.
p26
aVAnd today, we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition,
p27
aVat least to me, which is the following:
p28
aVTo doodle officially means
p29
aVto dawdle,
p30
aVto dilly dally, to monkey around,
p31
aVto make meaningless marks,
p32
aVto do something of little value, substance or import,
p33
aVand \u2014 my personal favorite \u2014
p34
aVto do nothing.
p35
aVNo wonder people are averse to doodling at work.
p36
aVDoing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work;
p37
aVit's totally inappropriate.
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VAdditionally, I've heard horror stories
p42
aVfrom people whose teachers scolded them, of course, for doodling in classrooms.
p43
aVAnd they have bosses who scold them for doodling in the boardroom.
p44
aVThere is a powerful cultural norm against doodling
p45
aVin settings in which we are supposed to learn something.
p46
aVAnd unfortunately,
p47
aVthe press tends to reinforce this norm
p48
aVwhen they're reporting on a doodling scene \u2014
p49
aVof an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like \u2014
p50
aVthey typically use words like "discovered"
p51
aVor "caught" or "found out,"
p52
aVas if there's some sort of criminal act being committed.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd additionally, there is a psychological aversion to doodling \u2014
p55
aVthank you, Freud.
p56
aVIn the 1930s, Freud told us all
p57
aVthat you could analyze people's psyches
p58
aVbased on their doodles.
p59
aVThis is not accurate, but it did happen to Tony Blair
p60
aVat the Davos Forum in 2005,
p61
aVwhen his doodles were, of course, "discovered"
p62
aVand he was labeled the following things.
p63
aVNow it turned out to be Bill Gates' doodle.
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aVAnd Bill, if you're here, nobody thinks you're megalomaniacal.
p66
aVBut that does contribute
p67
aVto people not wanting to share their doodles.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd here is the real deal. Here's what I believe.
p70
aVI think that our culture
p71
aVis so intensely focused on verbal information
p72
aVthat we're almost blinded to the value of doodling.
p73
aVAnd I'm not comfortable with that.
p74
aVAnd so because of that belief that I think needs to be burst,
p75
aVI'm here to send us all hurtling back to the truth.
p76
aVAnd here's the truth:
p77
aVdoodling is an incredibly powerful tool,
p78
aVand it is a tool that we need to remember and to re-learn.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo here's a new definition for doodling.
p81
aVAnd I hope there's someone in here from The Oxford English Dictionary,
p82
aVbecause I want to talk to you later.
p83
aVHere's the real definition:
p84
aVDoodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think.
p85
aVThat is why millions of people doodle.
p86
aVHere's another interesting truth about the doodle:
p87
aVPeople who doodle when they're exposed to verbal information
p88
aVretain more of that information
p89
aVthan their non-doodling counterparts.
p90
aVWe think doodling is something you do when you lose focus,
p91
aVbut in reality, it is a preemptive measure
p92
aVto stop you from losing focus.
p93
aVAdditionally, it has a profound effect
p94
aVon creative problem-solving
p95
aVand deep information processing.
p96
aa(lp97
VThere are four ways that learners intake information
p98
aVso that they can make decisions.
p99
aVThey are visual, auditory,
p100
aVreading and writing and kinesthetic.
p101
aVNow in order for us to really chew on information
p102
aVand do something with it,
p103
aVwe have to engage at least two of those modalities,
p104
aVor we have to engage one of those modalities
p105
aVcoupled with an emotional experience.
p106
aVThe incredible contribution of the doodle
p107
aVis that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneously
p108
aVwith the possibility of an emotional experience.
p109
aVThat is a pretty solid contribution
p110
aVfor a behavior equated with doing nothing.
p111
aa(lp112
VThis is so nerdy,
p113
aVbut this made me cry when I discovered this.
p114
aVSo they did anthropological research
p115
aVinto the unfolding of artistic activity in children,
p116
aVand they found that, across space and time,
p117
aVall children exhibit the same evolution in visual logic
p118
aVas they grow.
p119
aVIn other words, they have a shared and growing
p120
aVcomplexity in visual language
p121
aVthat happens in a predictable order.
p122
aVAnd I think that is incredible.
p123
aVI think that means doodling is native to us
p124
aVand we simply are denying ourselves that instinct.
p125
aVAnd finally, a lot a people aren't privy to this,
p126
aVbut the doodle is a precursor
p127
aVto some of our greatest cultural assets.
p128
aVThis is but one:
p129
aVthis is Frank Gehry the architect's precursor to the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo here is my point:
p132
aVUnder no circumstances should doodling be eradicated
p133
aVfrom a classroom or a boardroom
p134
aVor even the war room.
p135
aVOn the contrary,
p136
aVdoodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations
p137
aVwhere information density is very high
p138
aVand the need for processing that information is very high.
p139
aVAnd I will go you one further.
p140
aVBecause doodling is so universally accessible
p141
aVand it is not intimidating as an art form,
p142
aVit can be leveraged as a portal
p143
aVthrough which we move people
p144
aVinto higher levels of visual literacy.
p145
aVMy friends, the doodle has never been
p146
aVthe nemesis of intellectual thought.
p147
aVIn reality, it is one of its greatest allies.
p148
aa(lp149
VThank you.
