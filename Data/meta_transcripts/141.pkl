VFirst place I'd like to take you
p4
aVis what many believe will be the world's deepest natural abyss.
p5
aVAnd I say believe because this process is still ongoing.
p6
aVRight now there are major expeditions being planned for next year
p7
aVthat I'll talk a little bit about.
p8
aa(lp9
VOne of the things that's changed here,
p10
aVin the last 150 years since Jules Verne
p11
aVhad great science-fiction concepts of what the underworld was like,
p12
aVis that technology has enabled us to go to these places
p13
aVthat were previously completely unknown and speculated about.
p14
aVWe can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity.
p15
aVAlong the way we've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large
p16
aVthat you can see for hundreds of meters
p17
aVwithout a break in the line of sight.
p18
aVWhen you go on a thing like this, we can usually be in the field
p19
aVfor anywhere from two to four months,
p20
aVwith a team as small as 20 or 30, to as big as 150.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd a lot of people ask me, you know,
p23
aVwhat kind of people do you get for a project like this?
p24
aVWhile our selection process
p25
aVis not as rigorous as NASA, it's nonetheless thorough.
p26
aVWe're looking for competence, discipline, endurance, and strength.
p27
aVIn case you're wondering, this is our strength test.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVBut we also value esprit de corps
p30
aVand the ability to diplomatically resolve inter-personal conflict
p31
aVwhile under great stress in remote locations.
p32
aa(lp33
VWe have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance.
p34
aVFrom the entrance, this is nothing like a commercial cave.
p35
aVYou're looking at Camp Two in a place called J2, not K2, but J2.
p36
aVWe're roughly two days from the entrance at that point.
p37
aVAnd it's kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse,
p38
aVexcept that you're now running a string of these things down.
p39
aVThe idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort
p40
aVwhile you're down there, otherwise in damp, moist, cold conditions in utterly dark places.
p41
aVI should mention that everything you're seeing here, by the way,
p42
aVis artificially illuminated at great effort.
p43
aVOtherwise it is completely dark in these places.
p44
aa(lp45
VThe deeper you go, the more you run into a conflict with water.
p46
aVIt's basically like a tree collecting water coming down.
p47
aVAnd eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous
p48
aVand unfortunately slides just don't do justice.
p49
aVSo I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s.
p50
aVSo descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico.
p51
aV(Video)
p52
aVNow I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here
p53
aVare obsolete and dangerous.
p54
aVWe would not do this today unless we were doing it for film.
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VAlong that same line, I have to tell you
p58
aVthat with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year,
p59
aVwe have never seen monsters underground \u2014
p60
aVat least the kind that eat you.
p61
aVIf there is a monster underground,
p62
aVit is the crushing psychological remoteness
p63
aVthat begins to hit every member of the team
p64
aVonce you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance.
p65
aa(lp66
VNext year I'll be leading an international team to J2.
p67
aVWe're going to be shooting from minus 2,600 meters \u2014
p68
aVthat's a little over 8,600 feet down \u2014
p69
aVat 30 kilometers from the entrance.
p70
aVThe lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight.
p71
aVI don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time.
p72
aa(lp73
VEventually, if you keep going down in these things,
p74
aVprobability says that you're going to run into a place like this.
p75
aVIt's a place where there's a fold in the geologic stratum
p76
aVthat collects water and fills to the roof.
p77
aVAnd when you used to find these things,
p78
aVthey would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon.
p79
aVNow I remember that term really well for two reasons.
p80
aVNumber one, it's the name of my rock band, and second,
p81
aVis because the confrontation of these things
p82
aVforced me to become an inventor.
p83
aVAnd we've since gone on to develop
p84
aVmany generations of gadgets for exploring places like this.
p85
aa(lp86
VThis is some life-support equipment closed-cycle.
p87
aVAnd you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally
p88
aVunderwater and to depths of 200 meters straight down underwater.
p89
aVWhen you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA.
p90
aVIt's like doing extra-vehicular activity in space,
p91
aVbut at much greater distances, and at much greater physical peril.
p92
aVSo it makes you think about how to design your equipment
p93
aVfor long range, away from a safe haven.
p94
aa(lp95
VHere's a clip from a National Geographic movie
p96
aVthat came out in 1999.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Video) Narrator: Exploration is a physical process
p99
aVof putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before.
p100
aVThis is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet.
p101
aVTo experience it is a privilege.
p102
aa(lp103
VBill Stone: That was taken in Wakulla Springs, Florida.
p104
aVCouple of things to note about that movie. Every piece of equipment
p105
aVthat you saw in there did not exist before 1999.
p106
aVIt was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects.
p107
aVThis gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper,
p108
aVand it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done
p109
aVof a cave, and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs.
p110
aVIt was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door
p111
aVto another unexplored world.
p112
aa(lp113
VThis is Europa.
p114
aVCarolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day.
p115
aVThis is one of the places where planetary scientists
p116
aVbelieve there is a highest probability of the detection
p117
aVof the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there.
p118
aVFor those who have never seen this story,
p119
aVJim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie
p120
aVcouple of years ago, called "Aliens of the Deep."
p121
aVThere was a brief clip \u2014
p122
aa(lp123
V(Video) Narrator: A mission to explore under the ice of Europa
p124
aVwould be the ultimate robotic challenge.
p125
aVEuropa is so far away that even at the speed of light,
p126
aVit would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle.
p127
aVIt has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards
p128
aVand to find a good landing site on the ice.
p129
aVNow we have to get through the ice.
p130
aVYou need a melt probe.
p131
aVIt's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo.
p132
aVThe ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep.
p133
aVWeek after week, the melt probe will sink of its own weight
p134
aVthrough the ancient ice, until finally \u2014
p135
aVNow, what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean?
p136
aVYou need an AUV, an autonomous underwater vehicle.
p137
aVIt needs to be one smart puppy, able to navigate
p138
aVand make decisions on its own in an alien ocean.
p139
aa(lp140
VBS: What Jim didn't know when he released that movie
p141
aVwas that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled
p142
aVto develop a prototype for the Europa AUV.
p143
aVI mean, I cut through three years of engineering meetings, design
p144
aVand system integration, and introduced DEPTHX \u2014
p145
aVDeep Phreatic Thermal Explorer.
p146
aVAnd as the movie says, this is one smart puppy.
p147
aVIt's got 96 sensors, 36 onboard computers,
p148
aV100,000 lines of behavioral autonomy code,
p149
aVpacks more than 10 kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent.
p150
aa(lp151
VThis is the target site,
p152
aVthe world's deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico.
p153
aVIt's been explored to a depth of 292 meters
p154
aVand beyond that nobody knows anything.
p155
aVThis is part of DEPTHX's mission.
p156
aa(lp157
VThere are two primary targets we're doing here.
p158
aVOne is, how do you do science autonomy underground?
p159
aVHow do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist?
p160
aVThere are more stages involved here
p161
aVthan I've got time to tell you about, but basically we drive
p162
aVthrough the space, we populate it with environmental variables \u2014
p163
aVsulphide, halide, things like that.
p164
aVWe calculate gradient surfaces, and drive the bot over to a wall
p165
aVwhere there's a high probability of life.
p166
aVWe move along the wall, in what's called proximity operations,
p167
aVlooking for changes in color.
p168
aVIf we see something that looks interesting, we pull it into a microscope.
p169
aVIf it passes the microscopic test, we go for a collection.
p170
aVWe either draw in a liquid sample,
p171
aVor we can actually take a solid core from the wall.
p172
aVNo hands at the wheel.
p173
aVThis is all behavioral autonomy here
p174
aVthat's being conducted by the robot on its own.
p175
aa(lp176
VThe real hat trick for this vehicle, though,
p177
aVis a disruptive new navigation system we've developed,
p178
aVknown as 3D SLAM, for simultaneous localization and mapping.
p179
aVDEPTHX is an all-seeing eyeball.
p180
aVIts sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time,
p181
aVallowing it to do new exploration
p182
aVwhile it's still achieving geometric sensor-lock
p183
aVon what it's gone through already.
p184
aa(lp185
VWhat I'm going to show you next
p186
aVis the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground
p187
aVthat's ever been done.
p188
aVThis May, we're going to go from minus 1,000 meters in Zacaton,
p189
aVand if we're very lucky, DEPTHX will bring back the first
p190
aVrobotically-discovered division of bacteria.
p191
aVThe next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then,
p192
aVif the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go,
p193
aVwe could potentially launch by 2016, and by 2019
p194
aVwe may have the first evidence of life off this planet.
p195
aa(lp196
VWhat then of manned space exploration?
p197
aVThe government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024.
p198
aVThe successful conclusion of that mission will result
p199
aVin infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number
p200
aVof government scientists and pilots.
p201
aVIt will leave us no further along in the general expansion
p202
aVof humanity into space than we were 50 years ago.
p203
aVSomething fundamental has to change
p204
aVif we are to see common access to space in our lifetime.
p205
aa(lp206
VWhat I'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas.
p207
aVAnd I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith
p208
aVthat there's credibility behind what we're going to say here.
p209
aVThere are three underpinnings of working in space privately.
p210
aVOne of them is the requirement
p211
aVfor economical earth-to-space transport.
p212
aVThe Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world
p213
aVhave got this in their sights and I salute them.
p214
aVGo, go, go.
p215
aa(lp216
VThe next thing we need are places to stay on orbit.
p217
aVOrbital hotels to start with, but workshops for the rest of us later on.
p218
aVThe final missing piece, the real paradigm-buster, is this:
p219
aVa gas station on orbit.
p220
aVIt's not going to look like that.
p221
aVIf it existed, it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning.
p222
aa(lp223
VNow, to give you a chance to understand
p224
aVwhy there is power in that statement,
p225
aVI've got to give you the basics of Space 101.
p226
aVAnd the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram.
p227
aVAnybody drink one of these here this week?
p228
aVYou'd pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit.
p229
aVThat's more than you pay for TED,
p230
aVif Google dropped their sponsorship.
p231
aV(Laughter)
p232
aVThe second is more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant.
p233
aVThus, every time you'd want to do anything in space,
p234
aVyou are literally blowing away enormous sums of money
p235
aVevery time you hit the accelerator.
p236
aVNot even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics.
p237
aa(lp238
VSo, what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price?
p239
aVThere is a place where you can.
p240
aVIn fact, you can get it better \u2014 you can get it at 14 times lower
p241
aVif you can find propellant on the moon.
p242
aVThere is a little-known mission that was launched
p243
aVby the Pentagon, 13 years ago now, called Clementine.
p244
aVAnd the most amazing thing that came out of that mission
p245
aVwas a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater
p246
aVon the south pole of the moon.
p247
aVThat signal was so strong,
p248
aVit could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water
p249
aVburied in the sediment, collected over millions and billions of years
p250
aVby the impact of asteroids and comet material.
p251
aa(lp252
VIf we're going to get that, and make that gas station possible,
p253
aVwe have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space.
p254
aVWe can't do that right now.
p255
aVThe way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack
p256
aVthat has to be launched from the ground,
p257
aVand resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces.
p258
aVWe have to beat that.
p259
aVWe can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics.
p260
aVWe can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything.
p261
aVThis is an idea that, again, came out of Livermore back in 1989,
p262
aVwith Dr. Lowell Wood's group.
p263
aVAnd we can extend that now to just about everything.
p264
aVBob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit.
p265
aVWe can go much further.
p266
aVWe can build space tugs, orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water.
p267
aVThere's another thing.
p268
aVWhen you're coming back from the moon,
p269
aVyou have to deal with orbital mechanics.
p270
aVIt says you're moving 10,000 feet per second faster
p271
aVthan you really want to be to get back to your gas station.
p272
aa(lp273
VYou got two choices.
p274
aVYou can burn rocket fuel to get there, or you can do something really incredible.
p275
aVYou can dive into the stratosphere,
p276
aVand precisely dissipate that velocity, and come back out to the space station.
p277
aVIt has never been done.
p278
aVIt's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride \u2014
p279
aVbetter than Disney.
p280
aVThe traditional approach to space exploration
p281
aVhas been that you carry all the fuel you need
p282
aVto get everybody back in case of an emergency.
p283
aVIf you try to do that for the moon,
p284
aVyou're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there.
p285
aVBut if you send a mining team there,
p286
aVwithout the return propellant, first \u2014
p287
aV(Laughter)
p288
aVDid any of you guys hear the story of Cortez?
p289
aVThis is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty.
p290
aVI like this equipment, you know, and I really value it
p291
aVso we're not going to burn the gear.
p292
aVBut, if you were truly bold you could get it there, manufacture it,
p293
aVand it would be the most dramatic demonstration
p294
aVthat you could do something worthwhile off this planet
p295
aVthat has ever been done.
p296
aVThere's a myth that you can't do anything in space
p297
aVfor less than a trillion dollars and 20 years.
p298
aVThat's not true.
p299
aVIn seven years, we could pull off
p300
aVan industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate
p301
aVthat you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-earth orbit.
p302
aa(lp303
VWe're living in one of the most exciting times in history.
p304
aVWe're at a magical confluence where private wealth
p305
aVand imagination are driving the demand for access to space.
p306
aVThe orbital refueling stations I've just described
p307
aVcould create an entirely new industry and provide the final key
p308
aVfor opening space to the general exploration.
p309
aVTo bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed.
p310
aVWe can do it by jump-starting with an industrial
p311
aVLewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater,
p312
aVto mine the moon for resources, and demonstrate
p313
aVthey can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit.
p314
aa(lp315
VTalk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities
p316
aVof purpose and timing.
p317
aVI would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED.
p318
aVI intend to lead that expedition.
p319
aV(Applause)
p320
aVIt can be done in seven years with the right backing.
p321
aVThose who join me in making it happen will become a part of history
p322
aVand join other bold individuals from time past
p323
aVwho, had they been here today, would have heartily approved.
p324
aa(lp325
VThere was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier.
p326
aVWe have collectively forgotten that lesson.
p327
aVNow we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward.
p328
aV100 years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words,
p329
aVI intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon
p330
aVand complete the final piece
p331
aVthat will open the space frontier, in our time, for all of us.
p332
aVThank you.
