VI have a doppelganger.

aVDr. Gero is a brilliant

aVbut slightly mad scientist
p7
aVin the "Dragonball Z: Android Saga."
p8
aVIf you look very carefully,
p9
aVyou see that his skull has been replaced
p10
aVwith a transparent Plexiglas dome
p11
aVso that the workings of his brain can be observed
p12
aVand also controlled with light.
p13
aVThat's exactly what I do \u2014
p14
aVoptical mind control.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VBut in contrast to my evil twin
p19
aVwho lusts after world domination,
p20
aVmy motives are not sinister.
p21
aVI control the brain
p22
aVin order to understand how it works.
p23
aVNow wait a minute, you may say,
p24
aVhow can you go straight to controlling the brain
p25
aVwithout understanding it first?
p26
aVIsn't that putting the cart before the horse?
p27
aVMany neuroscientists agree with this view
p28
aVand think that understanding will come
p29
aVfrom more detailed observation and analysis.
p30
aVThey say, "If we could record the activity of our neurons,
p31
aVwe would understand the brain."
p32
aVBut think for a moment what that means.
p33
aVEven if we could measure
p34
aVwhat every cell is doing at all times,
p35
aVwe would still have to make sense
p36
aVof the recorded activity patterns,
p37
aVand that's so difficult,
p38
aVchances are we'll understand these patterns
p39
aVjust as little as the brains that produce them.
p40
aa(lp41
VTake a look at what brain activity might look like.
p42
aVIn this simulation, each black dot
p43
aVis one nerve cell.
p44
aVThe dot is visible
p45
aVwhenever a cell fires an electrical impulse.
p46
aVThere's 10,000 neurons here.
p47
aVSo you're looking at roughly one percent
p48
aVof the brain of a cockroach.
p49
aVYour brains are about 100 million times
p50
aVmore complicated.
p51
aVSomewhere, in a pattern like this,
p52
aVis you,
p53
aVyour perceptions,
p54
aVyour emotions, your memories,
p55
aVyour plans for the future.
p56
aVBut we don't know where,
p57
aVsince we don't know how to read the pattern.
p58
aVWe don't understand the code used by the brain.
p59
aVTo make progress,
p60
aVwe need to break the code.
p61
aVBut how?
p62
aVAn experienced code-breaker will tell you
p63
aVthat in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean,
p64
aVit's essential to be able to play with them,
p65
aVto rearrange them at will.
p66
aVSo in this situation too,
p67
aVto decode the information
p68
aVcontained in patterns like this,
p69
aVwatching alone won't do.
p70
aVWe need to rearrange the pattern.
p71
aVIn other words,
p72
aVinstead of recording the activity of neurons,
p73
aVwe need to control it.
p74
aVIt's not essential that we can control
p75
aVthe activity of all neurons in the brain, just some.
p76
aVThe more targeted our interventions, the better.
p77
aVAnd I'll show you in a moment
p78
aVhow we can achieve the necessary precision.
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd since I'm realistic, rather than grandiose,
p81
aVI don't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system
p82
aVwill at once unravel all its mysteries.
p83
aVBut we'll certainly learn a lot.
p84
aVNow, I'm by no means
p85
aVthe first person to realize
p86
aVhow powerful a tool intervention is.
p87
aVThe history of attempts
p88
aVto tinker with the function of the nervous system
p89
aVis long and illustrious.
p90
aVIt dates back at least 200 years,
p91
aVto Galvani's famous experiments
p92
aVin the late 18th century and beyond.
p93
aVGalvani showed that a frog's legs twitched
p94
aVwhen he connected the lumbar nerve
p95
aVto a source of electrical current.
p96
aVThis experiment revealed the first, and perhaps most fundamental,
p97
aVnugget of the neural code:
p98
aVthat information is written in the form
p99
aVof electrical impulses.
p100
aVGalvani's approach
p101
aVof probing the nervous system with electrodes
p102
aVhas remained state-of-the-art until today,
p103
aVdespite a number of drawbacks.
p104
aVSticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude.
p105
aVIt's hard to do in animals that run around,
p106
aVand there is a physical limit
p107
aVto the number of wires
p108
aVthat can be inserted simultaneously.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo around the turn of the last century,
p111
aVI started to think,
p112
aV"Wouldn't it be wonderful if one could take this logic
p113
aVand turn it upside down?"
p114
aVSo instead of inserting a wire
p115
aVinto one spot of the brain,
p116
aVre-engineer the brain itself
p117
aVso that some of its neural elements
p118
aVbecome responsive to diffusely broadcast signals
p119
aVsuch as a flash of light.
p120
aVSuch an approach would literally, in a flash of light,
p121
aVovercome many of the obstacles to discovery.
p122
aVFirst, it's clearly a non-invasive,
p123
aVwireless form of communication.
p124
aVAnd second, just as in a radio broadcast,
p125
aVyou can communicate with many receivers at once.
p126
aVYou don't need to know where these receivers are,
p127
aVand it doesn't matter if these receivers move \u2014
p128
aVjust think of the stereo in your car.
p129
aVIt gets even better,
p130
aVfor it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers
p131
aVout of materials that are encoded in DNA.
p132
aVSo each nerve cell
p133
aVwith the right genetic makeup
p134
aVwill spontaneously produce a receiver
p135
aVthat allows us to control its function.
p136
aVI hope you'll appreciate
p137
aVthe beautiful simplicity
p138
aVof this concept.
p139
aVThere's no high-tech gizmos here,
p140
aVjust biology revealed through biology.
p141
aa(lp142
VNow let's take a look at these miraculous receivers up close.
p143
aVAs we zoom in on one of these purple neurons,
p144
aVwe see that its outer membrane
p145
aVis studded with microscopic pores.
p146
aVPores like these conduct electrical current
p147
aVand are responsible
p148
aVfor all the communication in the nervous system.
p149
aVBut these pores here are special.
p150
aVThey are coupled to light receptors
p151
aVsimilar to the ones in your eyes.
p152
aVWhenever a flash of light hits the receptor,
p153
aVthe pore opens, an electrical current is switched on,
p154
aVand the neuron fires electrical impulses.
p155
aVBecause the light-activated pore is encoded in DNA,
p156
aVwe can achieve incredible precision.
p157
aVThis is because,
p158
aValthough each cell in our bodies
p159
aVcontains the same set of genes,
p160
aVdifferent mixes of genes get turned on and off
p161
aVin different cells.
p162
aVYou can exploit this to make sure
p163
aVthat only some neurons
p164
aVcontain our light-activated pore and others don't.
p165
aVSo in this cartoon, the bluish white cell
p166
aVin the upper-left corner
p167
aVdoes not respond to light
p168
aVbecause it lacks the light-activated pore.
p169
aVThe approach works so well
p170
aVthat we can write purely artificial messages
p171
aVdirectly to the brain.
p172
aVIn this example, each electrical impulse,
p173
aVeach deflection on the trace,
p174
aVis caused by a brief pulse of light.
p175
aVAnd the approach, of course, also works
p176
aVin moving, behaving animals.
p177
aa(lp178
VThis is the first ever such experiment,
p179
aVsort of the optical equivalent of Galvani's.
p180
aVIt was done six or seven years ago
p181
aVby my then graduate student, Susana Lima.
p182
aVSusana had engineered the fruit fly on the left
p183
aVso that just two out of the 200,000 cells in its brain
p184
aVexpressed the light-activated pore.
p185
aVYou're familiar with these cells
p186
aVbecause they are the ones that frustrate you
p187
aVwhen you try to swat the fly.
p188
aVThey trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air
p189
aVand fly away whenever you move your hand in position.
p190
aVAnd you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect.
p191
aVThe animal jumps, it spreads its wings, it vibrates them,
p192
aVbut it can't actually take off
p193
aVbecause the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates.
p194
aVNow to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly
p195
aVto a flash it could see,
p196
aVSusana did a simple
p197
aVbut brutally effective experiment.
p198
aVShe cut the heads off of her flies.
p199
aVThese headless bodies can live for about a day,
p200
aVbut they don't do much.
p201
aVThey just stand around
p202
aVand groom excessively.
p203
aVSo it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity.
p204
aV(Laughter)
p205
aVAnyway, as you'll see in a moment,
p206
aVSusana was able to turn on the flight motor
p207
aVof what's the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies
p208
aVand get some of the headless bodies
p209
aVto actually take off and fly away.
p210
aVThey didn't get very far, obviously.
p211
aVSince we took these first steps,
p212
aVthe field of optogenetics has exploded.
p213
aVAnd there are now hundreds of labs
p214
aVusing these approaches.
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd we've come a long way
p217
aVsince Galvani's and Susana's first successes
p218
aVin making animals twitch or jump.
p219
aVWe can now actually interfere with their psychology
p220
aVin rather profound ways,
p221
aVas I'll show you in my last example,
p222
aVwhich is directed at a familiar question.
p223
aVLife is a string of choices
p224
aVcreating a constant pressure to decide what to do next.
p225
aVWe cope with this pressure by having brains,
p226
aVand within our brains, decision-making centers
p227
aVthat I've called here the "Actor."
p228
aVThe Actor implements a policy that takes into account
p229
aVthe state of the environment
p230
aVand the context in which we operate.
p231
aVOur actions change the environment, or context,
p232
aVand these changes are then fed back into the decision loop.
p233
aa(lp234
VNow to put some neurobiological meat
p235
aVon this abstract model,
p236
aVwe constructed a simple one-dimensional world
p237
aVfor our favorite subject, fruit flies.
p238
aVEach chamber in these two vertical stacks
p239
aVcontains one fly.
p240
aVThe left and the right halves of the chamber
p241
aVare filled with two different odors,
p242
aVand a security camera watches
p243
aVas the flies pace up and down between them.
p244
aVHere's some such CCTV footage.
p245
aVWhenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber
p246
aVwhere the two odor streams meet,
p247
aVit has to make a decision.
p248
aVIt has to decide whether to turn around
p249
aVand stay in the same odor,
p250
aVor whether to cross the midline
p251
aVand try something new.
p252
aVThese decisions are clearly a reflection
p253
aVof the Actor's policy.
p254
aVNow for an intelligent being like our fly,
p255
aVthis policy is not written in stone
p256
aVbut rather changes as the animal learns from experience.
p257
aVWe can incorporate such an element
p258
aVof adaptive intelligence into our model
p259
aVby assuming that the fly's brain
p260
aVcontains not only an Actor,
p261
aVbut a different group of cells,
p262
aVa "Critic," that provides a running commentary
p263
aVon the Actor's choices.
p264
aVYou can think of this nagging inner voice
p265
aVas sort of the brain's equivalent
p266
aVof the Catholic Church,
p267
aVif you're an Austrian like me,
p268
aVor the super-ego, if you're Freudian,
p269
aVor your mother, if you're Jewish.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VNow obviously,
p274
aVthe Critic is a key ingredient
p275
aVin what makes us intelligent.
p276
aVSo we set out to identify
p277
aVthe cells in the fly's brain
p278
aVthat played the role of the Critic.
p279
aVAnd the logic of our experiment was simple.
p280
aVWe thought if we could use our optical remote control
p281
aVto activate the cells of the Critic,
p282
aVwe should be able, artificially, to nag the Actor
p283
aVinto changing its policy.
p284
aVIn other words,
p285
aVthe fly should learn from mistakes
p286
aVthat it thought it had made
p287
aVbut, in reality, it had not made.
p288
aVSo we bred flies
p289
aVwhose brains were more or less randomly peppered
p290
aVwith cells that were light addressable.
p291
aVAnd then we took these flies
p292
aVand allowed them to make choices.
p293
aVAnd whenever they made one of the two choices,
p294
aVchose one odor,
p295
aVin this case the blue one over the orange one,
p296
aVwe switched on the lights.
p297
aVIf the Critic was among the optically activated cells,
p298
aVthe result of this intervention
p299
aVshould be a change in policy.
p300
aVThe fly should learn to avoid
p301
aVthe optically reinforced odor.
p302
aa(lp303
VHere's what happened in two instances:
p304
aVWe're comparing two strains of flies,
p305
aVeach of them having
p306
aVabout 100 light-addressable cells in their brains,
p307
aVshown here in green on the left and on the right.
p308
aVWhat's common among these groups of cells
p309
aVis that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine.
p310
aVBut the identities of the individual
p311
aVdopamine-producing neurons
p312
aVare clearly largely different on the left and on the right.
p313
aVOptically activating
p314
aVthese hundred or so cells
p315
aVinto two strains of flies
p316
aVhas dramatically different consequences.
p317
aVIf you look first at the behavior
p318
aVof the fly on the right,
p319
aVyou can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber
p320
aVwhere the two odors meet,
p321
aVit marches straight through, as it did before.
p322
aVIts behavior is completely unchanged.
p323
aVBut the behavior of the fly on the left is very different.
p324
aVWhenever it comes up to the midpoint,
p325
aVit pauses,
p326
aVit carefully scans the odor interface
p327
aVas if it was sniffing out its environment,
p328
aVand then it turns around.
p329
aVThis means that the policy that the Actor implements
p330
aVnow includes an instruction to avoid the odor
p331
aVthat's in the right half of the chamber.
p332
aVThis means that the Critic
p333
aVmust have spoken in that animal,
p334
aVand that the Critic must be contained
p335
aVamong the dopamine-producing neurons on the left,
p336
aVbut not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right.
p337
aa(lp338
VThrough many such experiments,
p339
aVwe were able to narrow down
p340
aVthe identity of the Critic
p341
aVto just 12 cells.
p342
aVThese 12 cells, as shown here in green,
p343
aVsend the output to a brain structure
p344
aVcalled the "mushroom body,"
p345
aVwhich is shown here in gray.
p346
aVWe know from our formal model
p347
aVthat the brain structure
p348
aVat the receiving end of the Critic's commentary is the Actor.
p349
aVSo this anatomy suggests
p350
aVthat the mushroom bodies have something to do
p351
aVwith action choice.
p352
aVBased on everything we know about the mushroom bodies,
p353
aVthis makes perfect sense.
p354
aVIn fact, it makes so much sense
p355
aVthat we can construct an electronic toy circuit
p356
aVthat simulates the behavior of the fly.
p357
aVIn this electronic toy circuit,
p358
aVthe mushroom body neurons are symbolized
p359
aVby the vertical bank of blue LEDs
p360
aVin the center of the board.
p361
aVThese LED's are wired to sensors
p362
aVthat detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air.
p363
aVEach odor activates a different combination of sensors,
p364
aVwhich in turn activates
p365
aVa different odor detector in the mushroom body.
p366
aVSo the pilot in the cockpit of the fly,
p367
aVthe Actor,
p368
aVcan tell which odor is present
p369
aVsimply by looking at which of the blue LEDs lights up.
p370
aa(lp371
VWhat the Actor does with this information
p372
aVdepends on its policy,
p373
aVwhich is stored in the strengths of the connection,
p374
aVbetween the odor detectors
p375
aVand the motors
p376
aVthat power the fly's evasive actions.
p377
aVIf the connection is weak, the motors will stay off
p378
aVand the fly will continue straight on its course.
p379
aVIf the connection is strong, the motors will turn on
p380
aVand the fly will initiate a turn.
p381
aVNow consider a situation
p382
aVin which the motors stay off,
p383
aVthe fly continues on its path
p384
aVand it suffers some painful consequence
p385
aVsuch as getting zapped.
p386
aVIn a situation like this,
p387
aVwe would expect the Critic to speak up
p388
aVand to tell the Actor
p389
aVto change its policy.
p390
aVWe have created such a situation, artificially,
p391
aVby turning on the critic with a flash of light.
p392
aVThat caused a strengthening of the connections
p393
aVbetween the currently active odor detector
p394
aVand the motors.
p395
aVSo the next time
p396
aVthe fly finds itself facing the same odor again,
p397
aVthe connection is strong enough to turn on the motors
p398
aVand to trigger an evasive maneuver.
p399
aa(lp400
VI don't know about you,
p401
aVbut I find it exhilarating to see
p402
aVhow vague psychological notions
p403
aVevaporate and give rise
p404
aVto a physical, mechanistic understanding of the mind,
p405
aVeven if it's the mind of the fly.
p406
aVThis is one piece of good news.
p407
aVThe other piece of good news,
p408
aVfor a scientist at least,
p409
aVis that much remains to be discovered.
p410
aVIn the experiments I told you about,
p411
aVwe have lifted the identity of the Critic,
p412
aVbut we still have no idea
p413
aVhow the Critic does its job.
p414
aVCome to think of it, knowing when you're wrong
p415
aVwithout a teacher, or your mother, telling you,
p416
aVis a very hard problem.
p417
aVThere are some ideas in computer science
p418
aVand in artificial intelligence
p419
aVas to how this might be done,
p420
aVbut we still haven't solved
p421
aVa single example
p422
aVof how intelligent behavior
p423
aVsprings from the physical interactions
p424
aVin living matter.
p425
aVI think we'll get there in the not too distant future.
