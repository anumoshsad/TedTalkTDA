VI've been fascinated with crop diversity for about 35 years from now,
p4
aVever since I stumbled across a fairly obscure academic article
p5
aVby a guy named Jack Harlan.
p6
aVAnd he described the diversity within crops \u2014
p7
aVall the different kinds of wheat and rice and such \u2014
p8
aVas a genetic resource.
p9
aVAnd he said, "This genetic resource," \u2014
p10
aVand I'll never forget the words \u2014
p11
aV"stands between us and catastrophic starvation
p12
aVon a scale we cannot imagine."
p13
aa(lp14
VI figured he was either really on to something,
p15
aVor he was one of these academic nutcases.
p16
aVSo, I looked a little further,
p17
aVand what I figured out was that he wasn't a nutcase.
p18
aVHe was the most respected scientist in the field.
p19
aVWhat he understood was that biological diversity \u2014 crop diversity \u2014
p20
aVis the biological foundation of agriculture.
p21
aVIt's the raw material, the stuff, of evolution in our agricultural crops.
p22
aVNot a trivial matter.
p23
aVAnd he also understood that that foundation was crumbling,
p24
aVliterally crumbling.
p25
aVThat indeed, a mass extinction was underway
p26
aVin our fields, in our agricultural system.
p27
aVAnd that this mass extinction was taking place
p28
aVwith very few people noticing
p29
aVand even fewer caring.
p30
aa(lp31
VNow, I know that many of you don't stop
p32
aVto think about diversity in agricultural systems
p33
aVand, let's face it, that's logical.
p34
aVYou don't see it in the newspaper every day.
p35
aVAnd when you go into the supermarket, you certainly don't see a lot of choices there.
p36
aVYou see apples that are red, yellow, and green and that's about it.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo, let me show you a picture of one form of diversity.
p39
aVHere's some beans,
p40
aVand there are about 35 or 40 different
p41
aVvarieties of beans on this picture.
p42
aVNow, imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another
p43
aVabout the same way as a poodle from a Great Dane.
p44
aVIf I wanted to show you a picture of all the dog breeds in the world,
p45
aVand I put 30 or 40 of them on a slide, it would take about 10 slides
p46
aVbecause there about 400 breeds of dogs in the world.
p47
aVBut there are 35 to 40,000 different varieties of beans.
p48
aVSo if I were to going to show you all the beans in the world,
p49
aVand I had a slide like this, and I switched it every second,
p50
aVit would take up my entire TED talk,
p51
aVand I wouldn't have to say anything.
p52
aa(lp53
VBut the interesting thing is that this diversity \u2014 and the tragic thing is \u2014
p54
aVthat this diversity is being lost.
p55
aVWe have about 200,000 different varieties of wheat,
p56
aVand we have about 2 to 400,000 different varieties of rice,
p57
aVbut it's being lost.
p58
aVAnd I want to give you an example of that.
p59
aVIt's a bit of a personal example, in fact.
p60
aVIn the United States, in the 1800s \u2014 that's where we have the best data \u2014
p61
aVfarmers and gardeners were growing 7,100
p62
aVnamed varieties of apples.
p63
aVImagine that. 7,100 apples with names.
p64
aVToday, 6,800 of those are extinct,
p65
aVno longer to be seen again.
p66
aa(lp67
VI used to have a list of these extinct apples,
p68
aVand when I would go out and give a presentation,
p69
aVI would pass the list out in the audience.
p70
aVI wouldn't tell them what it was, but it was in alphabetical order,
p71
aVand I would tell them to look for their names, their family names,
p72
aVtheir mother's maiden name.
p73
aVAnd at the end of the speech, I would ask, "How many people have found a name?"
p74
aVAnd I never had fewer than two-thirds of an audience hold up their hand.
p75
aVAnd I said, "You know what? These apples come from your ancestors,
p76
aVand your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them.
p77
aVThey gave them their name.
p78
aVThe bad news is they're extinct.
p79
aVThe good news is a third of you didn't hold up your hand. Your apple's still out there.
p80
aVFind it. Make sure it doesn't join the list."
p81
aa(lp82
VSo, I want to tell you that the piece of the good news is
p83
aVthat the Fowler apple is still out there.
p84
aVAnd there's an old book back here,
p85
aVand I want to read a piece from it.
p86
aVThis book was published in 1904.
p87
aVIt's called "The Apples of New York" and this is the second volume.
p88
aVSee, we used to have a lot of apples.
p89
aVAnd the Fowler apple is described in here \u2014
p90
aVI hope this doesn't surprise you \u2014
p91
aVas, "a beautiful fruit."
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aVI don't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us, but ...
p94
aVbut, to be honest, the description goes on
p95
aVand it says that it "doesn't rank high in quality, however."
p96
aVAnd then he has to go even further.
p97
aVIt sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine.
p98
aV"As grown in New York, the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and quality
p99
aVand is, on the whole, unsatisfactory."
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd I guess there's a lesson to be learned here,
p104
aVand the lesson is: so why save it?
p105
aVI get this question all the time. Why don't we just save the best one?
p106
aVAnd there are a couple of answers to that question.
p107
aVOne thing is that there is no such thing as a best one.
p108
aVToday's best variety is tomorrow's lunch for insects or pests or disease.
p109
aVThe other thing is that maybe that Fowler apple
p110
aVor maybe a variety of wheat that's not economical right now
p111
aVhas disease or pest resistance
p112
aVor some quality that we're going to need for climate change that the others don't.
p113
aVSo it's not necessary, thank God,
p114
aVthat the Fowler apple is the best apple in the world.
p115
aVIt's just necessary or interesting that it might have one good, unique trait.
p116
aVAnd for that reason, we ought to be saving it.
p117
aVWhy? As a raw material, as a trait we can use in the future.
p118
aVThink of diversity as giving us options.
p119
aVAnd options, of course, are exactly what we need in an era of climate change.
p120
aa(lp121
VI want to show you two slides,
p122
aVbut first, I want to tell you that we've been working at the Global Crop Diversity Trust
p123
aVwith a number of scientists \u2014 particularly at Stanford and University of Washington \u2014
p124
aVto ask the question: What's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change
p125
aVand what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops
p126
aVto be able to adapt to this?
p127
aVIn short, the answer is that in the future, in many countries,
p128
aVthe coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter
p129
aVthan anything those crops have seen in the past.
p130
aVThe coldest growing seasons of the future,
p131
aVhotter than the hottest of the past.
p132
aVIs agriculture adapted to that?
p133
aVI don't know. Can fish play the piano?
p134
aVIf agriculture hasn't experienced that, how could it be adapted?
p135
aa(lp136
VNow, the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world,
p137
aVand the place where climate change, ironically, is going to be the worst
p138
aVis in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
p139
aVSo I've picked two examples here, and I want to show you.
p140
aVIn the histogram before you now,
p141
aVthe blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures,
p142
aVgoing back about far as we have temperature data.
p143
aVAnd you can see that there's some difference
p144
aVbetween one growing season and another.
p145
aVSome are colder, some are hotter and it's a bell shaped curve.
p146
aVThe tallest bar is the average temperature for the most number of growing seasons.
p147
aVIn the future, later this century, it's going to look like the red,
p148
aVtotally out of bounds.
p149
aVThe agricultural system and, more importantly, the crops in the field in India
p150
aVhave never experienced this before.
p151
aa(lp152
VHere's South Africa. The same story.
p153
aVBut the most interesting thing about South Africa is
p154
aVwe don't have to wait for 2070 for there to be trouble.
p155
aVBy 2030, if the maize, or corn, varieties, which is the dominant crop \u2014
p156
aV50 percent of the nutrition in Southern Africa are still in the field \u2014
p157
aVin 2030, we'll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize
p158
aVbecause of the climate change already in 2030.
p159
aV30 percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population,
p160
aVthat's a food crisis. It's global in nature.
p161
aVWe will watch children starve to death on TV.
p162
aVNow, you may say that 20 years is a long way off.
p163
aVIt's two breeding cycles for maize.
p164
aVWe have two rolls of the dice to get this right.
p165
aVWe have to get climate-ready crops in the field,
p166
aVand we have to do that rather quickly.
p167
aa(lp168
VNow, the good news is that we have conserved.
p169
aVWe have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity,
p170
aVagricultural diversity, mostly in the form of seed,
p171
aVand we put it in seed banks, which is a fancy way of saying a freezer.
p172
aVIf you want to conserve seed for a long term
p173
aVand you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers,
p174
aVyou dry it and then you freeze it.
p175
aVUnfortunately, these seed banks are located around the world in buildings
p176
aVand they're vulnerable.
p177
aVDisasters have happened. In recent years we lost the gene bank,
p178
aVthe seed bank in Iraq and Afghanistan. You can guess why.
p179
aVIn Rwanda, in the Solomon Islands.
p180
aVAnd then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings,
p181
aVfinancial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures,
p182
aVand all kinds of things, and every time something like this happens,
p183
aVit means extinction. We lose diversity.
p184
aVAnd I'm not talking about losing diversity in the same way that you lose your car keys.
p185
aVI'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs:
p186
aVactually losing it, never to be seen again.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo, a number of us got together and decided that, you know, enough is enough
p189
aVand we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility
p190
aVthat can really offer protection for our biological diversity of \u2014
p191
aVmaybe not the most charismatic diversity.
p192
aVYou don't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear,
p193
aVbut it's very important diversity.
p194
aVSo we needed a really safe place, and we went quite far north to find it.
p195
aVTo Svalbard, in fact.
p196
aVThis is above mainland Norway. You can see Greenland there.
p197
aVThat's at 78 degrees north.
p198
aVIt's as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane.
p199
aVIt's a remarkably beautiful landscape. I can't even begin to describe it to you.
p200
aVIt's otherworldly, beautiful.
p201
aVWe worked with the Norwegian government
p202
aVand with the NorGen, the Norwegian Genetic Resources Program,
p203
aVto design this facility.
p204
aVWhat you see is an artist's conception of this facility,
p205
aVwhich is built in a mountain in Svalbard.
p206
aVThe idea of Svalbard was that it's cold,
p207
aVso we get natural freezing temperatures.
p208
aVBut it's remote. It's remote and accessible
p209
aVso it's safe and we don't depend on mechanical refrigeration.
p210
aa(lp211
VThis is more than just an artist's dream, it's now a reality.
p212
aVAnd this next picture shows it in context, in Svalbard.
p213
aVAnd here's the front door of this facility.
p214
aVWhen you open up the front door,
p215
aVthis is what you're looking at. It's pretty simple. It's a hole in the ground.
p216
aVIt's a tunnel, and you go into the tunnel,
p217
aVchiseled in solid rock, about 130 meters.
p218
aVThere are now a couple of security doors, so you won't see it quite like this.
p219
aVAgain, when you get to the back, you get into an area that's really my favorite place.
p220
aVI think of it as sort of a cathedral.
p221
aVAnd I know that this tags me as a bit of a nerd, but ...
p222
aV(Laughter)
p223
aVSome of the happiest days of my life have been spent ...
p224
aV(Laughter)
p225
aVin this place there.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Applause)
p228
aa(lp229
VIf you were to walk into one of these rooms, you would see this.
p230
aVIt's not very exciting, but if you know what's there, it's pretty emotional.
p231
aVWe have now about 425,000
p232
aVsamples of unique crop varieties.
p233
aVThere's 70,000 samples of different varieties of rice
p234
aVin this facility right now.
p235
aVAbout a year from now, we'll have over half a million samples.
p236
aVWe're going up to over a million, and someday we'll basically have samples \u2014
p237
aVabout 500 seeds \u2014
p238
aVof every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state
p239
aVin this facility.
p240
aVThis is a backup system for world agriculture.
p241
aVIt's a backup system for all the seed banks. Storage is free.
p242
aVIt operates like a safety deposit box.
p243
aVNorway owns the mountain and the facility, but the depositors own the seed.
p244
aVAnd if anything happens, then they can come back and get it.
p245
aVThis particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the United States,
p246
aVof Canada, and an international institution from Syria.
p247
aa(lp248
VI think it's interesting in that this facility, I think,
p249
aVis almost the only thing I can think of these days where countries,
p250
aVliterally, every country in the world \u2014
p251
aVbecause we have seeds from every country in the world \u2014
p252
aVall the countries of the world have gotten together
p253
aVto do something that's both long term, sustainable and positive.
p254
aVI can't think of anything else that's happened in my lifetime that way.
p255
aa(lp256
VI can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a solution
p257
aVfor climate change, for the water crisis.
p258
aVAgriculture takes 70 percent of fresh water supplies on earth.
p259
aVI can't look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution
p260
aVfor those things, or the energy crisis, or world hunger, or peace in conflict.
p261
aVI can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a simple solution for that,
p262
aVbut I can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can't solve any of those problems
p263
aVif we don't have crop diversity.
p264
aVBecause I challenge you to think of an effective, efficient, sustainable
p265
aVsolution to climate change if we don't have crop diversity.
p266
aVBecause, quite literally, if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change,
p267
aVneither will we.
p268
aVAnd if crops don't adapt to climate change, neither will agriculture,
p269
aVneither will we.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo, this is not something pretty and nice to do.
p272
aVThere are a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exist
p273
aVjust for the existence value of it.
p274
aVIt is, I agree, a nice thing to do.
p275
aVBut it's a necessary thing to do.
p276
aVSo, in a very real sense, I believe that we, as an international community,
p277
aVshould get organized to complete the task.
p278
aVThe Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a wonderful gift
p279
aVthat Norway and others have given us,
p280
aVbut it's not the complete answer.
p281
aVWe need to collect the remaining diversity that's out there.
p282
aVWe need to put it into good seed banks
p283
aVthat can offer those seeds to researchers in the future.
p284
aVWe need to catalog it. It's a library of life,
p285
aVbut right now I would say we don't have a card catalog for it.
p286
aVAnd we need to support it financially.
p287
aa(lp288
VMy big idea would be that while we think of it as commonplace
p289
aVto endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university,
p290
aVwe really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat.
p291
aV30 million dollars in an endowment would take care
p292
aVof preserving all the diversity in wheat forever.
p293
aVSo we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms.
p294
aa(lp295
VAnd my final thought is that we, of course, by conserving wheat,
p296
aVrice, potatoes, and the other crops,
p297
aVwe may, quite simply, end up saving ourselves.
p298
aa(lp299
