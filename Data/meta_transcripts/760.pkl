VThe problem I want to talk with you about is really the problem of:
p4
aVHow does one supply health care in a world in which cost is everything?
p5
aVHow do you do that?
p6
aVAnd the basic paradigm we want to suggest to you,
p7
aVI want to suggest to you,
p8
aVis one in which you say that in order to treat disease,
p9
aVyou have to first know what you're treating, that's diagnostics,
p10
aVand then you have to do something.
p11
aa(lp12
VThe program we're involved in is something we call "Diagnostics for All,"
p13
aVor "zero-cost diagnostics."
p14
aVHow do you provide medically relevant information
p15
aVat as close as possible to zero cost?
p16
aVHow do you do it?
p17
aVLet me just give you two examples.
p18
aVThe rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world:
p19
aVpoor resources, a rigorous environment \u2014 a series of problems \u2014
p20
aVlight weight and things of this kind.
p21
aVAnd also they're not so different from the home health care
p22
aVand diagnostic system world.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo, the technology I want to talk about is for the third world,
p25
aVfor the developing world,
p26
aVbut it has, I think, much broader application,
p27
aVbecause information is so important in the health care system.
p28
aVSo you see two examples here.
p29
aVOne is a lab that is actually a fairly high-end laboratory in Africa.
p30
aVThe second is basically an entrepreneur who is set up and doing who-knows-what
p31
aVat a table in a market.
p32
aVI don't know what kind of health care is delivered there.
p33
aVBut it's not really what is probably most efficient.
p34
aa(lp35
VWhat is our approach?
p36
aVThe way in which one typically approaches a problem of lowering cost,
p37
aVstarting from the perspective of the United States,
p38
aVis to take our solution,
p39
aVand then try to cut cost out of it.
p40
aVNo matter how you do that,
p41
aVyou're not going to start with a $100,000 instrument
p42
aVand bring it down to no cost.
p43
aVIt isn't going to work.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo the approach we took was the other way around, to ask:
p46
aVWhat is the cheapest possible stuff
p47
aVthat you could make a diagnostic system out of,
p48
aVand get useful information and add function?
p49
aVAnd what we've chosen is paper.
p50
aVWhat you see here is a prototypic device.
p51
aVIt's about a centimeter on the side.
p52
aVIt's about the size of a fingernail.
p53
aVThe lines around the edges are a polymer.
p54
aVIt's made of paper.
p55
aVAnd paper, of course, wicks fluid, as you know, paper, cloth \u2014
p56
aVdrop wine on the tablecloth,
p57
aVand the wine wicks all over everything.
p58
aVPut it on your shirt, it ruins the shirt.
p59
aVThat's what a hydrophilic surface does.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo in this device, the idea is that you drip the bottom end of it
p62
aVin a drop of, in this case, urine.
p63
aVThe fluid wicks its way into those chambers at the top.
p64
aVThe brown color indicates the amount of glucose in the urine,
p65
aVthe blue color indicates the amount of protein in the urine.
p66
aVAnd the combination of those two is a first-order shot
p67
aVat a number of useful things that you want.
p68
aVSo, this is an example of a device made from a simple piece of paper.
p69
aa(lp70
VNow, how simple can you make the production?
p71
aVWhy do we choose paper?
p72
aVThere's an example of the same thing on a finger,
p73
aVshowing you basically what it looks like.
p74
aVOne reason for using paper is that it's everywhere.
p75
aVWe have made these kinds of devices using napkins and toilet paper
p76
aVand wraps, and all kinds of stuff.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo the production capability is there.
p79
aVThe second is, you can put lots and lots of tests in a very small place.
p80
aVI'll show you in a moment that the stack of paper there
p81
aVwould probably hold something like 100,000 tests,
p82
aVsomething of that kind.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd then finally, a point you don't think of so much
p85
aVin developed world medicine:
p86
aVit eliminates sharps.
p87
aVAnd what sharps means is needles, things that stick.
p88
aVIf you've taken a sample of someone's blood
p89
aVand the someone might have hepatitis C,
p90
aVyou don't want to make a mistake and stick it in you.
p91
aVYou don't want to do that.
p92
aVSo how do you dispose of that?
p93
aVIt's a problem everywhere, and here, you simply burn it.
p94
aVSo it's a sort of a practical approach to starting on things.
p95
aa(lp96
VNow, you say, "If paper is a good idea,
p97
aVother people have surely thought of it."
p98
aVAnd the answer is, of course, yes.
p99
aVThose half of you, roughly, who are women,
p100
aVat some point may have had a pregnancy test.
p101
aVAnd the most common of these is in a device
p102
aVthat looks like the thing on the left.
p103
aVIt's something called a lateral-flow immunoassay.
p104
aVIn that particular test,
p105
aVurine, either containing a hormone called hCG,
p106
aVdoes or does not flow across a piece of paper.
p107
aVAnd there are two bars; one bar indicates that the test is working,
p108
aVand if the second bar shows up, you're pregnant.
p109
aa(lp110
VThis is a terrific kind of test in a binary world,
p111
aVand the nice thing about pregnancy is either you are pregnant
p112
aVor you're not pregnant;
p113
aVyou're not partially pregnant or thinking about being pregnant
p114
aVor something of that sort.
p115
aVSo it works very well there, but it doesn't work very well
p116
aVwhen you need more quantitative information.
p117
aa(lp118
VThere are also dipsticks,
p119
aVbut if you look at the dipsticks,
p120
aVthey're for another kind of urine analysis.
p121
aVThere are an awful lot of colors and things like that.
p122
aVWhat do you actually do about that in a difficult circumstance?
p123
aVSo the approach we started with is to ask:
p124
aVIs it really practical to make things of this sort?
p125
aVAnd that problem is now, in a purely engineering way, solved.
p126
aVAnd the procedure that we have is simply to start with paper.
p127
aVYou run it through a new kind of printer called a wax printer.
p128
aVThe wax printer does what looks like printing.
p129
aVIt is printing.
p130
aVYou put that on, you warm it a little bit,
p131
aVthe wax prints through, so it absorbs into the paper,
p132
aVand you end up with the device you want.
p133
aa(lp134
VThe printers cost 800 bucks now.
p135
aVWe estimate that if you were to run them 24 hours a day,
p136
aVthey'd make about 10 million tests a year.
p137
aVSo it's a solved problem. That particular problem is solved.
p138
aVAnd there is an example of the kind of thing that you see.
p139
aVThat's on a piece of 8 by 12 paper.
p140
aVThat takes about two seconds to make.
p141
aVAnd so I regard that as done.
p142
aVThere's a very important issue here,
p143
aVwhich is that because it's a printer, a color printer, it prints colors.
p144
aVThat's what color printers do.
p145
aVI'll show you in a moment, that's actually quite useful.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow, the next question that you would like to ask is:
p148
aVWhat would you like to measure? What would you like to analyze?
p149
aVAnd the thing you'd most like to analyze, we're a fair distance from.
p150
aVIt's what's called "fever of undiagnosed origin."
p151
aVSomeone comes into the clinic, they have a fever, they feel bad.
p152
aVWhat do they have?
p153
aVDo they have TB? Do they have AIDS? Do they have a common cold?
p154
aVThe triage problem.
p155
aVThat's a hard problem for reasons I won't go through.
p156
aVThere are an awful lot of things that you'd like to distinguish among.
p157
aVBut then there are a series of things \u2014
p158
aVAIDS, hepatitis, malaria, TB, others \u2014
p159
aVand simpler ones, such as guidance of treatment.
p160
aa(lp161
VNow, even that's more complicated than you think.
p162
aVA friend of mine works in transcultural psychiatry,
p163
aVand he is interested in the question
p164
aVof why people do and don't take their meds.
p165
aVSo Dapsone, or something like that, you have to take for a while.
p166
aVHe has a wonderful story of talking to a villager in India
p167
aVand saying,
p168
aV"Have you taken your Dapsone?" "Yes."
p169
aV"Have you taken it every day?" "Yes."
p170
aV"Have you taken if for a month?" "Yes."
p171
aVWhat the guy actually meant
p172
aVwas that he'd fed a 30-day dose of Dapsone to his dog that morning.
p173
aa(lp174
V(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd he was telling the truth, because in a different culture,
p177
aVthe dog is a surrogate for you;
p178
aV"today," "this month," "since the rainy season" \u2014
p179
aVthere are lots of opportunities for misunderstanding.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd so an issue here is to, in some cases, figure out
p184
aVhow to deal with matters that seem uninteresting, like compliance.
p185
aa(lp186
VNow, take a look at what a typical test looks like.
p187
aVPrick a finger, you get some blood \u2014 about 50 microliters.
p188
aVThat's about all you're going to get,
p189
aVbecause you can't use the usual sort of systems.
p190
aVYou can't manipulate it very well;
p191
aVI'll show something about that in a moment.
p192
aVSo you take the drop of blood, no further manipulations,
p193
aVyou put it on a little device,
p194
aVthe device filters out the blood cells, lets the serum go through,
p195
aVand you get a series of colors down in the bottom there.
p196
aVAnd the colors indicate "disease" or "normal."
p197
aVBut even that's complicated,
p198
aVbecause to me, colors might indicate "normal,"
p199
aVbut after all, we're all suffering from probably an excess of education.
p200
aa(lp201
VWhat do you do about something which requires quantitative analysis?
p202
aVAnd so the solution that we and many other people
p203
aVare thinking about there,
p204
aVand at this point, there is a dramatic flourish,
p205
aVand out comes the universal solution to everything these days,
p206
aVwhich is a cell phone \u2014
p207
aVin this particular case, a camera phone.
p208
aVThey're everywhere \u2014 six billion a month in India.
p209
aVAnd the idea is that what one does is to take the device,
p210
aVyou dip it, you develop the color,
p211
aVyou take a picture, the picture goes to a central laboratory.
p212
aVYou don't have to send out a doctor,
p213
aVyou send out somebody who can just take the sample,
p214
aVand in the clinic either a doctor, or ideally, a computer in this case,
p215
aVdoes the analysis.
p216
aVTurns out to work actually quite well,
p217
aVparticularly when your color printer has printed the color bars
p218
aVthat indicate how things work.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo my view of the health care worker of the future
p221
aVis not a doctor, but an 18-year-old,
p222
aVotherwise unemployed, who has two things:
p223
aVa backpack full of these tests and a lancet
p224
aVto occasionally take a blood sample,
p225
aVand an AK-47.
p226
aVAnd these are the things that get him through his day.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VThere's another very interesting connection here,
p231
aVand that is, that what one wants to do is pass through useful information
p232
aVover what is generally a pretty awful telephone system.
p233
aVIt turns out there's an enormous amount of information
p234
aValready available on that subject, which is the Mars Rover problem.
p235
aVHow do you get back an accurate view of the color on Mars
p236
aVif you have a really terrible bandwidth to do it with?
p237
aVAnd the answer is not complicated,
p238
aVbut it's one which I don't want to go through here,
p239
aVother than to say that the communication systems for doing this
p240
aVare really pretty well understood.
p241
aa(lp242
VAlso, a fact which you may not know
p243
aVis that the compute capability of this thing is not so different
p244
aVfrom the compute capability of your desktop computer.
p245
aVThis is a fantastic device which is only beginning to be tapped.
p246
aVI don't know whether the idea of one computer, one child
p247
aVmakes any sense.
p248
aVHere's the computer of the future,
p249
aVbecause this screen is already there and they're ubiquitous.
p250
aa(lp251
VAll right, let me show you just a little bit about advanced devices.
p252
aVAnd we'll start by posing a little problem.
p253
aVWhat you see here is another centimeter-sized device,
p254
aVand the different colors are different colors of dye.
p255
aVAnd you notice something
p256
aVwhich might strike you as a little bit interesting,
p257
aVwhich is, the yellow seems to disappear,
p258
aVget through the blue, and then get through the red.
p259
aVHow does that happen?
p260
aVHow do you make something flow through something?
p261
aVAnd, of course the answer is, "You don't."
p262
aVYou make it flow under and over.
p263
aa(lp264
VBut now the question is:
p265
aVHow do you make it flow under and over in a piece of paper?
p266
aVThe answer is that what you do \u2014
p267
aVand the details are not terribly important here \u2014
p268
aVis to make something more elaborate:
p269
aVYou take several different layers of paper,
p270
aVeach one containing its own little fluid system,
p271
aVand you separate them by pieces of, literally, double-sided carpet tape,
p272
aVthe stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor.
p273
aVAnd the fluid will flow from one layer into the next.
p274
aVIt distributes itself, flows through further holes,
p275
aVdistributes itself.
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd what you see, at the lower right-hand side there,
p278
aVis a sample in which a single sample of blood has been put on the top,
p279
aVand it has gone through and distributed itself
p280
aVinto these 16 holes on the bottom,
p281
aVin a piece of paper \u2014 basically, it looks like a chip,
p282
aVtwo pieces of paper thick.
p283
aVAnd in this particular case,
p284
aVwe were just interested in the replicability of that.
p285
aVBut that is, in principle, the way you solve
p286
aVthe "fever of unexplained origin" problem,
p287
aVbecause each one of those spots then becomes a test
p288
aVfor a particular set of markers of disease,
p289
aVand this will work in due course.
p290
aa(lp291
VHere is an example of a slightly more complicated device.
p292
aVThere's the chip.
p293
aVYou dip in a corner.
p294
aVThe fluid goes into the center.
p295
aVIt distributes itself out into these various wells or holes
p296
aVand turns color,
p297
aVall done with paper and carpet tape.
p298
aVSo it's, I think, as low-cost
p299
aVas we're likely to be able to come up and make things.
p300
aa(lp301
VNow, I have two last little stories to tell you
p302
aVin finishing off this business.
p303
aVThis is one:
p304
aVOne of the things you occasionally need to do
p305
aVis separate blood cells from serum.
p306
aVAnd the question was,
p307
aVhere we do it by taking a sample,
p308
aVwe put it in a centrifuge, we spin it,
p309
aVand you get blood cells out.
p310
aVTerrific.
p311
aVWhat happens if you don't have electricity, a centrifuge, and whatever?
p312
aVAnd we thought for a while of how you might do this,
p313
aVand the way, in fact, you do it, is what's shown here.
p314
aVYou get an eggbeater, which is everywhere, and you saw off a blade,
p315
aVand then you take tubing, and you stick it on that.
p316
aVYou put the blood in, somebody sits there and spins it.
p317
aVIt works really, really well.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd we sat down, we did the physics of eggbeaters
p320
aVand self-aligning tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing,
p321
aVand sent it off to a journal.
p322
aVWe were very proud of this,
p323
aVparticularly the title, which was "Eggbeater as Centrifuge."
p324
aa(lp325
V(Laughter)
p326
aa(lp327
VAnd we sent it off,
p328
aVand by return mail, it came back.
p329
aVI called up the editor and I said,
p330
aV"What's going on? How is this possible?"
p331
aVThe editor said, with enormous disdain,
p332
aV"I read this.
p333
aVAnd we're not going to publish it, because we only publish science."
p334
aa(lp335
V(Laughter)
p336
aa(lp337
VAnd it's an important issue,
p338
aVbecause it means that we have to, as a society,
p339
aVthink about what we value.
p340
aVAnd if it's just papers and Phys. Rev. letters,
p341
aVwe've got a problem.
p342
aa(lp343
VHere is another example of something which is \u2014
p344
aVthis is a little spectrophotometer.
p345
aVIt measures the absorption of light in a sample.
p346
aVThe neat thing about this is,
p347
aVyou have a light source that flickers on and off at about 1,000 hertz,
p348
aVanother light source that detects that light at 1,000 hertz,
p349
aVand so you can run this system in broad daylight.
p350
aVIt performs about equivalently
p351
aVto a system that's on the order of 100,000 dollars.
p352
aVIt costs 50 dollars.
p353
aVWe can probably make it for 50 cents if we put our mind to it.
p354
aVWhy doesn't somebody do it?
p355
aVThe answer is:
p356
aVHow do you make a profit in a capitalist system, doing that?
p357
aVInteresting problem.
p358
aa(lp359
VSo, let me finish by saying that we've thought about this
p360
aVas a kind of engineering problem.
p361
aVAnd we've asked: What is the scientific unifying idea here?
p362
aVAnd we've decided we should think about this
p363
aVnot so much in terms of cost, but in terms of simplicity.
p364
aVSimplicity is a neat word.
p365
aVYou've got to think about what simplicity means.
p366
aVI know what it is,
p367
aVbut I don't actually know what it means.
p368
aa(lp369
VSo I actually was interested enough in this
p370
aVto put together several groups of people.
p371
aVThe most recent involved a couple of people at MIT,
p372
aVone of them being an exceptionally bright kid
p373
aVwho is one of the very few people I would think of
p374
aVwho's an authentic genius.
p375
aVWe all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity.
p376
aVAnd I want to give you the answer of this deep scientific thought.
p377
aa(lp378
V[What is simplicity?
p379
aV"It's impossible to f..k it up"]
p380
aa(lp381
V(Laughter)
p382
aa(lp383
VSo, in a sense, you get what you pay for.
p384
aa(lp385
VThank you very much.
