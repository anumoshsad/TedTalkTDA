VLadies and gentlemen, at TED we talk a lot about leadership
p4
aVand how to make a movement.
p5
aVSo let's watch a movement happen, start to finish,
p6
aVin under three minutes
p7
aVand dissect some lessons from it.
p8
aa(lp9
VFirst, of course you know,
p10
aVa leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed.
p11
aVWhat he's doing is so easy to follow.
p12
aVHere's his first follower with a crucial role;
p13
aVhe's going to show everyone else how to follow.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, notice that the leader embraces him as an equal.
p16
aVNow it's not about the leader anymore;
p17
aVit's about them, plural.
p18
aVNow, there he is calling to his friends.
p19
aVNow, if you notice that the first follower
p20
aVis actually an underestimated form of leadership in itself.
p21
aVIt takes guts to stand out like that.
p22
aVThe first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
V(Applause)
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd here comes a second follower.
p29
aVNow it's not a lone nut, it's not two nuts \u2014
p30
aVthree is a crowd, and a crowd is news.
p31
aVSo a movement must be public.
p32
aVIt's important to show not just the leader, but the followers,
p33
aVbecause you find that new followers emulate the followers, not the leader.
p34
aa(lp35
VNow, here come two more people, and immediately after,
p36
aVthree more people.
p37
aVNow we've got momentum. This is the tipping point.
p38
aVNow we've got a movement.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VSo, notice that, as more people join in,
p43
aVit's less risky.
p44
aVSo those that were sitting on the fence before
p45
aVnow have no reason not to.
p46
aVThey won't stand out, they won't be ridiculed,
p47
aVbut they will be part of the in-crowd if they hurry.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VSo, over the next minute,
p52
aVyou'll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd
p53
aVbecause eventually they would be ridiculed for not joining in.
p54
aVAnd that's how you make a movement.
p55
aa(lp56
VBut let's recap some lessons from this.
p57
aVSo first, if you are the type,
p58
aVlike the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone,
p59
aVremember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals
p60
aVso it's clearly about the movement, not you.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VOkay, but we might have missed the real lesson here.
p65
aa(lp66
VThe biggest lesson, if you noticed \u2014
p67
aVdid you catch it? \u2014
p68
aVis that leadership is over-glorified.
p69
aVYes, it was the shirtless guy who was first,
p70
aVand he'll get all the credit,
p71
aVbut it was really the first follower
p72
aVthat transformed the lone nut into a leader.
p73
aVSo, as we're told that we should all be leaders,
p74
aVthat would be really ineffective.
p75
aa(lp76
VIf you really care about starting a movement,
p77
aVhave the courage to follow and show others how to follow.
p78
aVAnd when you find a lone nut doing something great,
p79
aVhave the guts to be the first one to stand up and join in.
p80
aVAnd what a perfect place to do that, at TED.
p81
aa(lp82
VThanks.
