VI'm a huge believer in hands-on education.
p4
aVBut you have to have the right tools.
p5
aVIf I'm going to teach my daughter about electronics,
p6
aVI'm not going to give her a soldering iron.
p7
aVAnd similarly, she finds prototyping boards
p8
aVreally frustrating for her little hands.
p9
aVSo my wonderful student Sam and I
p10
aVdecided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of:
p11
aVPlay-Doh.
p12
aVAnd so we spent a summer
p13
aVlooking at different Play-Doh recipes.
p14
aVAnd these recipes probably look really familiar
p15
aVto any of you who have made homemade play-dough \u2014
p16
aVpretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen.
p17
aVWe have two favorite recipes \u2014
p18
aVone that has these ingredients
p19
aVand a second that had sugar instead of salt.
p20
aVAnd they're great. We can make great little sculptures with these.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut the really cool thing about them is when we put them together.
p23
aVYou see that really salty Play-Doh?
p24
aVWell, it conducts electricity.
p25
aVAnd this is nothing new.
p26
aVIt turns out that regular Play-Doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity,
p27
aVand high school physics teachers have used that for years.
p28
aVBut our homemade play-dough
p29
aVactually has half the resistance of commercial Play-Doh.
p30
aVAnd that sugar dough?
p31
aVWell it's 150 times more resistant to electric current
p32
aVthan that salt dough.
p33
aVSo what does that mean?
p34
aVWell it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits \u2014
p35
aVcircuits that the most creative, tiny, little hands
p36
aVcan build on their own.
p37
aa(lp38
V(Applause)
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd so I want to do a little demo for you.
p41
aVSo if I take this salt dough,
p42
aVagain, it's like the play-dough you probably made as kids,
p43
aVand I plug it in \u2014
p44
aVit's a two-lead battery pack, simple battery pack,
p45
aVyou can buy them at Radio Shack
p46
aVand pretty much anywhere else \u2014
p47
aVwe can actually then
p48
aVlight things up.
p49
aVBut if any of you have studied electrical engineering,
p50
aVwe can also create a short circuit.
p51
aVIf I push these together, the light turns off.
p52
aVRight, the current wants to run through the play-dough, not through that LED.
p53
aVIf I separate them again, I have some light.
p54
aVWell now if I take that sugar dough,
p55
aVthe sugar dough doesn't want to conduct electricity.
p56
aVIt's like a wall to the electricity.
p57
aVIf I place that between, now all the dough is touching,
p58
aVbut if I stick that light back in,
p59
aVI have light.
p60
aVIn fact, I could even add some movement to my sculptures.
p61
aVIf I want a spinning tail, let's grab a motor,
p62
aVput some play-dough on it, stick it on
p63
aVand we have spinning.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Applause)
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd once you have the basics,
p68
aVwe can make a slightly more complicated circuit.
p69
aVWe call this our sushi circuit. It's very popular with kids.
p70
aVI plug in again the power to it.
p71
aVAnd now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits.
p72
aVI can start plugging in lots of lights.
p73
aVAnd we can start talking about things like electrical load.
p74
aVWhat happens if I put in lots of lights
p75
aVand then add a motor?
p76
aVIt'll dim.
p77
aVWe can even add microprocessors
p78
aVand have this as an input
p79
aVand create squishy sound music that we've done.
p80
aVYou could do parallel and series circuits
p81
aVfor kids using this.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo this is all in your home kitchen.
p84
aVWe've actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab.
p85
aVWe have a website, it's all there. These are the home recipes.
p86
aVWe've got some videos. You can make them yourselves.
p87
aVAnd it's been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone.
p88
aVWe've had a mom in Utah who used them with her kids,
p89
aVto a science researcher in the U.K.,
p90
aVand curriculum developers in Hawaii.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo I would encourage you all to grab some Play-Doh,
p93
aVgrab some salt, grab some sugar and start playing.
p94
aVWe don't usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab
p95
aVor little kids as circuit designers,
p96
aVbut maybe we should.
p97
aa(lp98
VHave fun. Thank you.
