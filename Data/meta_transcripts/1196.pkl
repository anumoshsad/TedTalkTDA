VThe question today is not:
p4
aVWhy did we invade Afghanistan?
p5
aVThe question is:
p6
aVwhy are we still in Afghanistan
p7
aVone decade later?
p8
aVWhy are we spending
p9
aV$135 billion?
p10
aVWhy have we got 130,000 troops on the ground?
p11
aVWhy were more people killed
p12
aVlast month
p13
aVthan in any preceding month
p14
aVof this conflict?
p15
aVHow has this happened?
p16
aVThe last 20 years
p17
aVhas been the age of intervention,
p18
aVand Afghanistan is simply one act
p19
aVin a five-act tragedy.
p20
aVWe came out of the end of the Cold War
p21
aVin despair.
p22
aVWe faced Rwanda;
p23
aVwe faced Bosnia,
p24
aVand then we rediscovered our confidence.
p25
aVIn the third act, we went into Bosnia and Kosovo
p26
aVand we seemed to succeed.
p27
aVIn the fourth act, with our hubris,
p28
aVour overconfidence developing,
p29
aVwe invaded Iraq and Afghanistan,
p30
aVand in the fifth act,
p31
aVwe plunged into a humiliating mess.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo the question is: What are we doing?
p34
aVWhy are we still stuck in Afghanistan?
p35
aVAnd the answer, of course,
p36
aVthat we keep being given
p37
aVis as follows:
p38
aVwe're told that we went into Afghanistan
p39
aVbecause of 9/11,
p40
aVand that we remain there
p41
aVbecause the Taliban poses an existential threat
p42
aVto global security.
p43
aVIn the words of President Obama,
p44
aV"If the Taliban take over again,
p45
aVthey will invite back Al-Qaeda,
p46
aVwho will try to kill as many of our people
p47
aVas they possibly can."
p48
aVThe story that we're told
p49
aVis that there was a "light footprint" initially \u2014
p50
aVin other words, that we ended up in a situation
p51
aVwhere we didn't have enough troops,
p52
aVwe didn't have enough resources,
p53
aVthat Afghans were frustrated \u2014
p54
aVthey felt there wasn't enough progress
p55
aVand economic development and security,
p56
aVand therefore the Taliban came back \u2014
p57
aVthat we responded in 2005 and 2006
p58
aVwith troop deployments,
p59
aVbut we still didn't put enough troops on the ground.
p60
aVAnd that it wasn't until 2009,
p61
aVwhen President Obama signed off on a surge,
p62
aVthat we finally had,
p63
aVin the words of Secretary Clinton,
p64
aV"the strategy, the leadership and the resources."
p65
aVSo, as the president now reassures us,
p66
aVwe are on track to achieve our goals.
p67
aa(lp68
VAll of this is wrong.
p69
aVEvery one of those statements is wrong.
p70
aVAfghanistan does not
p71
aVpose an existential threat
p72
aVto global security.
p73
aVIt is extremely unlikely
p74
aVthe Taliban would ever be able to take over the country \u2014
p75
aVextremely unlikely they'd be able to seize Kabul.
p76
aVThey simply don't have a conventional military option.
p77
aVAnd even if they were able to do so, even if I'm wrong,
p78
aVit's extremely unlikely
p79
aVthe Taliban would invite back Al-Qaeda.
p80
aVFrom the Taliban's point of view,
p81
aVthat was their number one mistake last time.
p82
aVIf they hadn't invited back Al-Qaeda,
p83
aVthey would still be in power today.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd even if I'm wrong about those two things,
p86
aVeven if they were able to take back the country,
p87
aVeven if they were to invite back Al-Qaeda,
p88
aVit's extremely unlikely
p89
aVthat Al-Qaeda would significantly enhance
p90
aVits ability to harm the United States
p91
aVor harm Europe.
p92
aVBecause this isn't the 1990s anymore.
p93
aVIf the Al-Qaeda base
p94
aVwas to be established near Ghazni,
p95
aVwe would hit them very hard,
p96
aVand it would be very, very difficult
p97
aVfor the Taliban to protect them.
p98
aa(lp99
VFurthermore, it's simply not true
p100
aVthat what went wrong in Afghanistan
p101
aVis the light footprint.
p102
aVIn my experience, in fact,
p103
aVthe light footprint was extremely helpful.
p104
aVAnd these troops that we brought in \u2014
p105
aVit's a great picture of David Beckham
p106
aVthere on the sub-machine gun \u2014
p107
aVmade the situation worse, not better.
p108
aVWhen I walked across Afghanistan
p109
aVin the winter of 2001-2002,
p110
aVwhat I saw was scenes like this.
p111
aVA girl, if you're lucky,
p112
aVin the corner of a dark room \u2014
p113
aVlucky to be able to look at the Koran.
p114
aVBut in those early days
p115
aVwhen we're told we didn't have enough troops and enough resources,
p116
aVwe made a lot of progress in Afghanistan.
p117
aVWithin a few months,
p118
aVthere were two and a half million more girls in school.
p119
aVIn Sangin where I was sick in 2002,
p120
aVthe nearest health clinic
p121
aVwas within three days walk.
p122
aVToday, there are 14 health clinics
p123
aVin that area alone.
p124
aVThere was amazing improvements.
p125
aVWe went from almost no Afghans
p126
aVhaving mobile telephones during the Taliban
p127
aVto a situation where, almost overnight,
p128
aVthree million Afghans had mobile telephones.
p129
aVAnd we had progress in the free media.
p130
aVWe had progress in elections \u2014
p131
aVall of this with the so-called light footprint.
p132
aa(lp133
VBut when we began to bring more money,
p134
aVwhen we began to invest more resources,
p135
aVthings got worse, not better. How?
p136
aVWell first see, if you put 125 billion dollars a year
p137
aVinto a country like Afghanistan
p138
aVwhere the entire revenue of the Afghan state
p139
aVis one billion dollars a year,
p140
aVyou drown everything.
p141
aVIt's not simply corruption and waste
p142
aVthat you create;
p143
aVyou essentially replace the priorities of the Afghan government,
p144
aVthe elected Afghan government,
p145
aVwith the micromanaging tendencies
p146
aVof foreigners on short tours
p147
aVwith their own priorities.
p148
aVAnd the same is true for the troops.
p149
aa(lp150
VWhen I walked across Afghanistan,
p151
aVI stayed with people like this.
p152
aVThis is Commandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj.
p153
aVCommandant Haji Malem Mohsin Khan of Kamenj was a great host.
p154
aVHe was very generous,
p155
aVlike many of the Afghans I stayed with.
p156
aVBut he was also considerably more conservative,
p157
aVconsiderably more anti-foreign,
p158
aVconsiderably more Islamist
p159
aVthan we'd like to acknowledge.
p160
aVThis man, for example, Mullah Mustafa,
p161
aVtried to shoot me.
p162
aVAnd the reason I'm looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph
p163
aVis I was somewhat frightened,
p164
aVand I was too afraid on this occasion
p165
aVto ask him, having run for an hour through the desert
p166
aVand taken refuge in this house,
p167
aVwhy he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me.
p168
aVBut 18 months later, I asked him
p169
aVwhy he had tried to shoot me.
p170
aVAnd Mullah Mustafa \u2014 he's the man with the pen and paper \u2014
p171
aVexplained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph,
p172
aVNadir Shah
p173
aVhad bet him that he couldn't hit me.
p174
aVNow this is not to say
p175
aVAfghanistan is a place full of people like Mullah Mustafa.
p176
aVIt's not; it's a wonderful place
p177
aVfull of incredible energy and intelligence.
p178
aVBut it is a place
p179
aVwhere the putting-in of the troops
p180
aVhas increased the violence rather than decreased it.
p181
aa(lp182
V2005, Anthony Fitzherbert,
p183
aVan agricultural engineer,
p184
aVcould travel through Helmand,
p185
aVcould stay in Nad Ali, Sangin and Ghoresh,
p186
aVwhich are now the names of villages where fighting is taking place.
p187
aVToday, he could never do that.
p188
aVSo the idea that we deployed the troops
p189
aVto respond to the Taliban insurgency
p190
aVis mistaken.
p191
aVRather than preceding the insurgency,
p192
aVthe Taliban followed the troop deployment,
p193
aVand as far as I'm concerned,
p194
aVthe troop deployment caused their return.
p195
aa(lp196
VNow is this a new idea?
p197
aVNo, there have been any number of people
p198
aVsaying this over the last seven years.
p199
aVI ran a center at Harvard
p200
aVfrom 2008 to 2010,
p201
aVand there were people like Michael Semple there
p202
aVwho speak Afghan languages fluently,
p203
aVwho've traveled to almost every district in the country.
p204
aVAndrew Wilder, for example,
p205
aVborn on the Pakistan-Iranian border,
p206
aVserved his whole life
p207
aVin Pakistan and Afghanistan.
p208
aVPaul Fishstein who began working there in 1978 \u2014
p209
aVworked for Save the Children,
p210
aVran the Afghan research and evaluation unit.
p211
aVThese are people
p212
aVwho were able to say consistently
p213
aVthat the increase in development aid
p214
aVwas making Afghanistan less secure, not more secure \u2014
p215
aVthat the counter-insurgency strategy
p216
aVwas not working and would not work.
p217
aVAnd yet, nobody listened to them.
p218
aVInstead,
p219
aVthere was a litany of astonishing optimism.
p220
aa(lp221
VBeginning in 2004,
p222
aVevery general came in saying,
p223
aV"I've inherited a dismal situation,
p224
aVbut finally I have the right resources and the correct strategy,
p225
aVwhich will deliver,"
p226
aVin General Barno's word in 2004,
p227
aVthe "decisive year."
p228
aVWell guess what? It didn't.
p229
aVBut it wasn't sufficient to prevent General Abuzaid saying
p230
aVthat he had the strategy and the resources
p231
aVto deliver, in 2005,
p232
aVthe "decisive year."
p233
aVOr General David Richards to come in 2006
p234
aVand say he had the strategy and the resources
p235
aVto deliver the "crunch year."
p236
aVOr in 2007,
p237
aVthe Norwegian deputy foreign minister, Espen Eide,
p238
aVto say that that would deliver the "decisive year."
p239
aVOr in 2008, Major General Champoux
p240
aVto come in and say he would deliver the "decisive year."
p241
aVOr in 2009, my great friend,
p242
aVGeneral Stanley McChrystal,
p243
aVwho said that he was "knee-deep in the decisive year."
p244
aVOr in 2010,
p245
aVthe U.K. foreign secretary, David Miliband,
p246
aVwho said that at last we would deliver the "decisive year."
p247
aVAnd you'll be delighted to hear in 2011, today,
p248
aVthat Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister,
p249
aVassures us that we are in the "decisive year."
p250
aa(lp251
V(Applause)
p252
aa(lp253
VHow do we allow
p254
aVany of this to happen?
p255
aVWell the answer, of course, is,
p256
aVif you spend 125 billion or 130 billion
p257
aVdollars a year in a country,
p258
aVyou co-opt almost everybody.
p259
aVEven the aid agencies,
p260
aVwho begin to receive an enormous amount of money
p261
aVfrom the U.S. and the European governments
p262
aVto build schools and clinics,
p263
aVare somewhat disinclined
p264
aVto challenge the idea
p265
aVthat Afghanistan is an existential threat
p266
aVto global security.
p267
aVThey're worried, in other words,
p268
aVthat if anybody believes that it wasn't such a threat \u2014
p269
aVOxfam, Save the Children
p270
aVwouldn't get the money
p271
aVto build their hospitals and schools.
p272
aVIt's also very difficult to confront a general
p273
aVwith medals on his chest.
p274
aVIt's very difficult for a politician,
p275
aVbecause you're afraid that many lives have been lost in vain.
p276
aVYou feel deep, deep guilt.
p277
aVYou exaggerate your fears,
p278
aVand you're terrified about the humiliation
p279
aVof defeat.
p280
aa(lp281
VWhat is the solution to this?
p282
aVWell the solution to this
p283
aVis we need to find a way
p284
aVthat people like Michael Semple, or those other people,
p285
aVwho are telling the truth, who know the country,
p286
aVwho've spent 30 years on the ground \u2014
p287
aVand most importantly of all,
p288
aVthe missing component of this \u2014
p289
aVAfghans themselves,
p290
aVwho understand what is going on.
p291
aVWe need to somehow get their message
p292
aVto the policymakers.
p293
aVAnd this is very difficult to do
p294
aVbecause of our structures.
p295
aa(lp296
VThe first thing we need to change
p297
aVis the structures of our government.
p298
aVVery, very sadly,
p299
aVour foreign services, the United Nations,
p300
aVthe military in these countries
p301
aVhave very little idea of what's going on.
p302
aVThe average British soldier is on a tour of only six months;
p303
aVItalian soldiers, on tours of four months;
p304
aVthe American military, on tours of 12 months.
p305
aVDiplomats are locked in embassy compounds.
p306
aVWhen they go out, they travel in these curious armored vehicles
p307
aVwith these somewhat threatening security teams
p308
aVwho ready 24 hours in advance
p309
aVwho say you can only stay on the ground for an hour.
p310
aa(lp311
VIn the British embassy in Afghanistan
p312
aVin 2008,
p313
aVan embassy of 350 people,
p314
aVthere were only three people who could speak Dari,
p315
aVthe main language of Afghanistan, at a decent level.
p316
aVAnd there was not a single Pashto speaker.
p317
aVIn the Afghan section in London
p318
aVresponsible for governing Afghan policy on the ground,
p319
aVI was told last year
p320
aVthat there was not a single staff member
p321
aVof the foreign office in that section
p322
aVwho had ever served
p323
aVon a posting in Afghanistan.
p324
aVSo we need to change that institutional culture.
p325
aVAnd I could make the same points about the United States
p326
aVand the United Nations.
p327
aa(lp328
VSecondly, we need to aim off of the optimism of the generals.
p329
aVWe need to make sure that we're a little bit suspicious,
p330
aVthat we understand that optimism
p331
aVis in the DNA of the military,
p332
aVthat we don't respond to it
p333
aVwith quite as much alacrity.
p334
aVAnd thirdly, we need to have some humility.
p335
aVWe need to begin from the position
p336
aVthat our knowledge, our power,
p337
aVour legitimacy
p338
aVis limited.
p339
aVThis doesn't mean
p340
aVthat intervention around the world is a disaster.
p341
aVIt isn't.
p342
aa(lp343
VBosnia and Kosovo
p344
aVwere signal successes,
p345
aVgreat successes.
p346
aVToday when you go to Bosnia
p347
aVit is almost impossible to believe
p348
aVthat what we saw in the early 1990s happened.
p349
aVIt's almost impossible to believe the progress we've made
p350
aVsince 1994.
p351
aVRefugee return,
p352
aVwhich the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
p353
aVthought would be extremely unlikely,
p354
aVhas largely happened.
p355
aVA million properties have been returned.
p356
aVBorders between the Bosniak territory
p357
aVand the Bosnian-Serb territory have calmed down.
p358
aVThe national army has shrunk.
p359
aVThe crime rates in Bosnia today
p360
aVare lower than they are in Sweden.
p361
aa(lp362
VThis has been done
p363
aVby an incredible, principled effort
p364
aVby the international community,
p365
aVand, of course, above all,
p366
aVby Bosnians themselves.
p367
aVBut you need to look at context.
p368
aVAnd this is what we've lost in Afghanistan and Iraq.
p369
aVYou need to understand that in those places
p370
aVwhat really mattered
p371
aVwas, firstly, the role of Tudman and Milosevic
p372
aVin coming to the agreement,
p373
aVand then the fact those men went,
p374
aVthat the regional situation improved,
p375
aVthat the European Union could offer Bosnia
p376
aVsomething extraordinary:
p377
aVthe chance to be part
p378
aVof a new thing, a new club,
p379
aVa chance to join something bigger.
p380
aa(lp381
VAnd finally, we need to understand that in Bosnia and Kosovo,
p382
aVa lot of the secret of what we did,
p383
aVa lot of the secret of our success,
p384
aVwas our humility \u2014
p385
aVwas the tentative nature of our engagement.
p386
aVWe criticized people a lot in Bosnia
p387
aVfor being quite slow to take on war criminals.
p388
aVWe criticized them
p389
aVfor being quite slow to return refugees.
p390
aVBut that slowness, that caution,
p391
aVthe fact that President Clinton initially said
p392
aVthat American troops would only be deployed for a year,
p393
aVturned out to be a strength,
p394
aVand it helped us to put our priorities right.
p395
aa(lp396
VOne of the saddest things
p397
aVabout our involvement in Afghanistan
p398
aVis that we've got our priorities out of sync.
p399
aVWe're not matching our resources to our priorities.
p400
aVBecause if what we're interested in is terrorism,
p401
aVPakistan is far more important than Afghanistan.
p402
aVIf what we're interested in is regional stability,
p403
aVEgypt is far more important.
p404
aVIf what we're worried about is poverty and development,
p405
aVsub-Saharan Africa is far more important.
p406
aVThis doesn't mean that Afghanistan doesn't matter,
p407
aVbut that it's one of 40 countries in the world
p408
aVwith which we need to engage.
p409
aa(lp410
VSo if I can finish with a metaphor for intervention,
p411
aVwhat we need to think of
p412
aVis something like mountain rescue.
p413
aVWhy mountain rescue?
p414
aVBecause when people talk about intervention,
p415
aVthey imagine that some scientific theory \u2014
p416
aVthe Rand Corporation goes around
p417
aVcounting 43 previous insurgencies
p418
aVproducing mathematical formula
p419
aVsaying you need one trained counter-insurgent
p420
aVfor every 20 members of the population.
p421
aVThis is the wrong way of looking at it.
p422
aVYou need to look at it in the way that you look at mountain rescue.
p423
aa(lp424
VWhen you're doing mountain rescue,
p425
aVyou don't take a doctorate in mountain rescue,
p426
aVyou look for somebody who knows the terrain.
p427
aVIt's about context.
p428
aVYou understand that you can prepare,
p429
aVbut the amount of preparation you can do
p430
aVis limited \u2014
p431
aVyou can take some water, you can have a map,
p432
aVyou can have a pack.
p433
aVBut what really matters
p434
aVis two kinds of problems \u2014
p435
aVproblems that occur on the mountain
p436
aVwhich you couldn't anticipate,
p437
aVsuch as, for example, ice on a slope,
p438
aVbut which you can get around,
p439
aVand problems which you couldn't anticipate
p440
aVand which you can't get around,
p441
aVlike a sudden blizzard or an avalanche
p442
aVor a change in the weather.
p443
aa(lp444
VAnd the key to this
p445
aVis a guide who has been on that mountain,
p446
aVin every temperature,
p447
aVat every period \u2014
p448
aVa guide who, above all,
p449
aVknows when to turn back,
p450
aVwho doesn't press on relentlessly
p451
aVwhen conditions turn against them.
p452
aVWhat we look for
p453
aVin firemen, in climbers, in policemen,
p454
aVand what we should look for in intervention,
p455
aVis intelligent risk takers \u2014
p456
aVnot people who plunge blind off a cliff,
p457
aVnot people who jump into a burning room,
p458
aVbut who weigh their risks,
p459
aVweigh their responsibilities.
p460
aVBecause the worst thing we have done in Afghanistan
p461
aVis this idea
p462
aVthat failure is not an option.
p463
aVIt makes failure invisible,
p464
aVinconceivable and inevitable.
p465
aVAnd if we can resist
p466
aVthis crazy slogan,
p467
aVwe shall discover \u2014
p468
aVin Egypt, in Syria, in Libya,
p469
aVand anywhere else we go in the world \u2014
p470
aVthat if we can often do much less than we pretend,
p471
aVwe can do much more than we fear.
p472
aa(lp473
VThank you very much.
p474
aa(lp475
V(Applause)
p476
aa(lp477
VThank you. Thank you very much.
p478
