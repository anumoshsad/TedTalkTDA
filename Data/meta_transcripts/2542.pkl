VTonight, I'm going to share with you my passion for science.
p4
aVI'm not talking about science that takes baby steps.
p5
aVI'm talking about science that takes enormous leaps.
p6
aVI'm talking Darwin, I'm talking Einstein,
p7
aVI'm talking revolutionary science that turns the world on its head.
p8
aVIn a moment, I'm going to talk about two ideas that might do this.
p9
aVI say "might"
p10
aVbecause, with revolutionary ideas, most are flat wrong,
p11
aVand even those that are right seldom have the impact
p12
aVthat we want them to have.
p13
aa(lp14
VTo explain why I picked two ideas in particular,
p15
aVI'm going to start with a mystery.
p16
aV1847, Vienna, Austria.
p17
aVIgnaz Semmelweis was a somber, compulsively thorough doctor
p18
aVwho ran two maternity clinics.
p19
aVThey were identical except for one thing.
p20
aVWomen were dying of high fevers soon after giving birth
p21
aVthree times more often at one of the clinics than at the other.
p22
aVTrying to figure out what the difference was that caused this,
p23
aVSemmelweis looked at everything he could.
p24
aVSanitation? No.
p25
aVMedical procedures? No.
p26
aVAir flow? No.
p27
aa(lp28
VThe puzzle went unsolved until he happened to autopsy a doctor
p29
aVwho died of an infected scalpel cut.
p30
aVThe doctor's symptoms were identical to those of the mothers who were dying.
p31
aVHow was that possible?
p32
aVHow could a male doctor get the same thing as new mothers?
p33
aVSemmelweis reconstructed everything the doctor had done
p34
aVright before he got sick,
p35
aVand he discovered that he'd been autopsying a corpse.
p36
aVHad something gotten in his wound that killed him?
p37
aVWith growing excitement,
p38
aVSemmelweis looked for any connection he could
p39
aVbetween dead bodies in the morgue and dead mothers in his delivery room,
p40
aVand he found it.
p41
aVIt turned out that at the hospital with the high death rate,
p42
aVbut not the others,
p43
aVdoctors delivered babies immediately after autopsying corpses in the morgue.
p44
aVAha! Corpses were contaminating the doctors' hands
p45
aVand killing his mothers.
p46
aVSo he ordered the doctors to sterilize their hands,
p47
aVand the deaths stopped.
p48
aVDr. Ignaz Semmelweis had discovered infectious disease.
p49
aa(lp50
VBut the doctors of the day thought he was crazy,
p51
aVbecause they knew, and had for hundreds of years,
p52
aVthat odorous vapors called miasmas caused disease,
p53
aVnot these hypothetical particles that you couldn't see.
p54
aVIt took 20 years for Frenchman Louis Pasteur
p55
aVto prove that Semmelweis was right.
p56
aVPasteur was an agricultural chemist
p57
aVwho tried to figure out why milk and beer spoiled so often.
p58
aVHe found that bacteria were the culprits.
p59
aVHe also found that bacteria could kill people in exactly the same way
p60
aVthat Semmelweis's patients were dying.
p61
aa(lp62
VWe now look at what I want to talk about tonight, in two ideas.
p63
aVWe saw it with Semmelweis, that he was a revolutionary.
p64
aVHe did it for two reasons.
p65
aVOne, he opened our eyes to a completely new world.
p66
aVWe'd known since the 1680s about bacteria.
p67
aVWe just didn't know that bacteria killed people.
p68
aVAnd he also demolished fond ideas that people kept close to their heart.
p69
aVMiasmas didn't kill people. Bacteria killed people.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo this brings me to the two ideas I want to talk about tonight.
p72
aVOne has opened our eyes to a completely new universe,
p73
aVand the other attacks long-held beliefs.
p74
aa(lp75
VLet's get started with Dr. Eric Betzig.
p76
aVHe's a physicist who has opened our eyes to an entirely new world
p77
aVby violating the laws of physics.
p78
aVBetzig is a true rebel.
p79
aVHe quit a job at prestigious Bell Laboratory
p80
aVinventing new microscopes for biology
p81
aVbecause he thought scientists were taking his brilliant inventions
p82
aVand doing lousy work with them.
p83
aVSo he became a househusband,
p84
aVbut he never lost his passion for figuring out
p85
aVhow to get microscopes to see finer and finer details
p86
aVthan had ever been seen before or ever could be seen.
p87
aVThis is crucial if we're ever going to understand how cells work,
p88
aVand how cancer works,
p89
aVand how something 150th the size of a head of a pin
p90
aVcan do all these amazing things,
p91
aVlike make proteins
p92
aVand move charges around
p93
aVand all of those things.
p94
aa(lp95
VThere's just one problem.
p96
aVThere's this thing called the law of physics,
p97
aVand part of the law of physics is the thing called the diffraction limit.
p98
aVThe diffraction limit is kind of like when you go to a doctor's office,
p99
aVyou can only see so far down, no matter how good glasses you have.
p100
aa(lp101
VThis was a so-called impossible problem.
p102
aVBut one of Betzig's friends figured out how to take a tiny molecule
p103
aVthat was smaller than the best microscope could see
p104
aVand get it to light up and fluoresce.
p105
aV"Aha!" Betzig said.
p106
aV"I think maybe the laws of physics are not so unbreakable after all."
p107
aa(lp108
VSo he lashed together a microscope in his friend's living room.
p109
aVHe had no laboratory.
p110
aVThis revolutionary instrument got different protein molecules
p111
aVto light up in different colors,
p112
aVand with a computer, he was able to turn very, very fuzzy blurs
p113
aVinto very sharp dots and produce images of unprecedented and startling clarity.
p114
aa(lp115
VFor this work, last year,
p116
aVEric Betzig won the Nobel Prize.
p117
aVWhy?
p118
aVBecause now we can see with unprecedented detail
p119
aVthings that we never had seen before,
p120
aVand now doctors can get a better handle on things like cancer.
p121
aa(lp122
VBut do you think Betzig was satisfied there?
p123
aVNo.
p124
aVHe wanted movies.
p125
aVThe problem was
p126
aVthat even the genius microscopes that he invented were just too slow.
p127
aVSo what did he do?
p128
aVHe came up with a 200-year-old idea
p129
aVcalled moiré patterns.
p130
aVSo the way that works is if you take two very, very fine patterns
p131
aVand you move them across each other,
p132
aVyou will see a gross pattern
p133
aVthat a microscope can see
p134
aVthat otherwise you would not be able to see.
p135
aVSo he applied this technique to taking a really blurry image of a cell
p136
aVand moving lots of structured light patterns across it
p137
aVuntil this cell became crystal clear.
p138
aVAnd here is the result:
p139
aVa mysterious new world,
p140
aVfull of strange things zipping around
p141
aVdoing things that we don't know what they're doing.
p142
aVBut when we figure it out, we'll have a better handle on life itself.
p143
aa(lp144
VFor example, those green globs that you see?
p145
aVThose things are called clathrins.
p146
aVThey're molecules that protect other molecules
p147
aVas they move through a cell.
p148
aVUnfortunately, viruses sometimes hijack those to infect cells.
p149
aVAlso, you see those little squiggly wormlike things moving around?
p150
aVThose are actin molecules.
p151
aVUnfortunately, viruses also climb down those things
p152
aVto get into the cell nucleus
p153
aVto replicate themselves and make you sick.
p154
aa(lp155
VNow that we can look at movies
p156
aVof what's actually going on deep inside a cell,
p157
aVwe have a much better chance of curing viral diseases like AIDS.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo when you look at a movie like this,
p160
aVit's very clear that Betzig has opened our eyes to a completely new world.
p161
aVBut he hasn't shattered any cherished beliefs.
p162
aa(lp163
VThat leads us to Dr. Aubrey de Grey
p164
aVat Cambridge.
p165
aVDe Grey definitely has scientists squirming with an interesting idea:
p166
aVwe can be immortal.
p167
aVWe can beat aging.
p168
aVNow, most scientists think he's a crackpot.
p169
aVAny Biology 101 student knows
p170
aVthat aging is an inevitable consequence of living.
p171
aVFor example, when we eat,
p172
aVwe take in food and we metabolize it,
p173
aVand that throws off what we call free radicals.
p174
aVYou might have heard of those.
p175
aVAlso known as oxygen ions,
p176
aVthose bind to our DNA, cause it to mutate,
p177
aVand cause us to get old and lose our hair.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Laughter)
p180
aa(lp181
VIt's just like, no, it's exactly like
p182
aVoxygen binding to iron and making it rust.
p183
aVSo you age because you rust out.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
VOh, and scientists also know there is something called immortality:
p188
aVin cancer cells.
p189
aVSo if you stop aging,
p190
aVall of you are going to turn into giant walking malignant tumors.
p191
aa(lp192
VThese are cherished beliefs, but could de Grey be on to something?
p193
aVI think he deserves a closer look.
p194
aVFirst of all, I have a really hard time seeing him as a crackpot.
p195
aVYeah, he started off life as a computer scientist,
p196
aVnot a biologist,
p197
aVbut he earned a PhD in biology from Cambridge,
p198
aVand he has published some very significant work
p199
aVon mitochondrial DNA and a bunch of other stuff.
p200
aVSecondly, he started an antiaging foundation
p201
aVthat has identified seven different causes of aging,
p202
aVto me, that seem very plausible,
p203
aVand he is hot in pursuit of fixes for every single one of them.
p204
aVFor example, one of the reasons we age is that our mitochondrial DNA mutates,
p205
aVand we get kind of old and our cells lose energy.
p206
aVHe believes, and he's made a convincing case,
p207
aVthat using viruses we can do gene therapy,
p208
aVfix that DNA
p209
aVand rejuvenate our cells.
p210
aa(lp211
VOne more thing.
p212
aVWe have an existent proof
p213
aVthat extreme longevity is possible.
p214
aVBristlecone pine trees live 5,000 years,
p215
aVand some lobsters don't age at all.
p216
aa(lp217
VNow, this doesn't mean that de Grey is going to revolutionize our lifespans.
p218
aVI mean, after all, we're not trees, and most of us are not lobsters.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
VBut I've got to believe that there are Darwins and Einsteins out there,
p223
aVand I'll tell you why.
p224
aVConsider this:
p225
aVthere are seven times more people alive today than during Darwin's time.
p226
aVThere are four times as many people alive today as Einstein.
p227
aVWhen you consider
p228
aVthat the proportion of scientists in the population has skyrocketed,
p229
aVthere are now seven million scientists.
p230
aVI've got to believe, and I do believe, that there's one of them out there
p231
aVwho is working right now in obscurity
p232
aVto rock our lives, and I don't know about you,
p233
aVbut I can't wait to be rocked.
p234
aa(lp235
VThank you.
