VMartin Luther King
p4
aVdid not say,
p5
aV"I have a nightmare,"
p6
aVwhen he inspired the civil rights movements.
p7
aVHe said, "I have a dream."
p8
aVAnd I have a dream.
p9
aVI have a dream that we can stop thinking
p10
aVthat the future will be a nightmare,
p11
aVand this is going to be a challenge,
p12
aVbecause, if you think
p13
aVof every major blockbusting film of recent times,
p14
aVnearly all of its visions for humanity
p15
aVare apocalyptic.
p16
aVI think this film
p17
aVis one of the hardest watches of modern times, "The Road."
p18
aVIt's a beautiful piece of filmmaking,
p19
aVbut everything is desolate,
p20
aVeverything is dead.
p21
aVAnd just a father and son
p22
aVtrying to survive, walking along the road.
p23
aVAnd I think the environmental movement
p24
aVof which I am a part of
p25
aVhas been complicit
p26
aVin creating this vision of the future.
p27
aa(lp28
VFor too long,
p29
aVwe have peddled a nightmarish vision
p30
aVof what's going to happen.
p31
aVWe have focused on the worst-case scenario.
p32
aVWe have focused on the problems.
p33
aVAnd we have not thought enough
p34
aVabout the solutions.
p35
aVWe've used fear, if you like,
p36
aVto grab people's attention.
p37
aVAnd any psychologist will tell you
p38
aVthat fear in the organism
p39
aVis linked to flight mechanism.
p40
aVIt's part of the fight and flight mechanism,
p41
aVthat when an animal is frightened \u2014
p42
aVthink of a deer.
p43
aVA deer freezes very, very still,
p44
aVpoised to run away.
p45
aVAnd I think that's what we're doing
p46
aVwhen we're asking people to engage with our agenda
p47
aVaround environmental degradation and climate change.
p48
aVPeople are freezing and running away
p49
aVbecause we're using fear.
p50
aVAnd I think the environmental movement has to grow up
p51
aVand start to think about
p52
aVwhat progress is.
p53
aa(lp54
VWhat would it be like to be improving the human lot?
p55
aVAnd one of the problems that we face, I think,
p56
aVis that the only people that have cornered the market
p57
aVin terms of progress
p58
aVis a financial definition of what progress is,
p59
aVan economic definition of what progress is \u2014
p60
aVthat somehow,
p61
aVif we get the right numbers to go up,
p62
aVwe're going to be better off,
p63
aVwhether that's on the stock market,
p64
aVwhether that's with GDP
p65
aVand economic growth,
p66
aVthat somehow life is going to get better.
p67
aVThis is somehow appealing to human greed
p68
aVinstead of fear \u2014
p69
aVthat more is better.
p70
aVCome on. In the Western world, we have enough.
p71
aVMaybe some parts of the world don't, but we have enough.
p72
aVAnd we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure
p73
aVof the welfare of nations.
p74
aVIn fact, the architect of our national accounting system,
p75
aVSimon Kuznets, in the 1930s,
p76
aVsaid that, "A nation's welfare
p77
aVcan scarcely be inferred from their national income."
p78
aVBut we've created a national accounting system
p79
aVwhich is firmly based on production
p80
aVand producing stuff.
p81
aVAnd indeed, this is probably historical, and it had its time.
p82
aVIn the second World War, we needed to produce a lot of stuff.
p83
aVAnd indeed, we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff
p84
aVthat we destroyed a lot of Europe, and we had to rebuild it afterwards.
p85
aVAnd so our national accounting system
p86
aVbecame fixated on what we can produce.
p87
aa(lp88
VBut as early as 1968,
p89
aVthis visionary man, Robert Kennedy,
p90
aVat the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign,
p91
aVgave the most eloquent deconstruction
p92
aVof gross national product
p93
aVthat ever has been.
p94
aVAnd he finished his talk with the phrase,
p95
aVthat, "The gross national product
p96
aVmeasures everything except that
p97
aVwhich makes life worthwhile."
p98
aVHow crazy is that? That our measure of progress,
p99
aVour dominant measure of progress in society,
p100
aVis measuring everything
p101
aVexcept that which makes life worthwhile?
p102
aVI believe, if Kennedy was alive today,
p103
aVhe would be asking statisticians such as myself
p104
aVto go out and find out
p105
aVwhat makes life worthwhile.
p106
aVHe'd be asking us to redesign
p107
aVour national accounting system
p108
aVto be based upon
p109
aVsuch important things as social justice,
p110
aVsustainability
p111
aVand people's well-being.
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd actually, social scientists have already gone out
p114
aVand asked these questions around the world.
p115
aVThis is from a global survey.
p116
aVIt's asking people, what do they want.
p117
aVAnd unsurprisingly, people all around the world
p118
aVsay that what they want
p119
aVis happiness, for themselves,
p120
aVfor their families, their children,
p121
aVtheir communities.
p122
aVOkay, they think money is slightly important.
p123
aVIt's there, but it's not nearly as important as happiness,
p124
aVand it's not nearly as important as love.
p125
aVWe all need to love and be loved in life.
p126
aVIt's not nearly as important as health.
p127
aVWe want to be healthy and live a full life.
p128
aVThese seem to be natural human aspirations.
p129
aVWhy are statisticians not measuring these?
p130
aVWhy are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms,
p131
aVinstead of just how much stuff we have?
p132
aVAnd really, this is what I've done with my adult life \u2014
p133
aVis think about how do we measure happiness,
p134
aVhow do we measure well-being,
p135
aVhow can we do that within environmental limits.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd we created, at the organization that I work for,
p138
aVthe New Economics Foundation,
p139
aVsomething we call the Happy Planet Index,
p140
aVbecause we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy.
p141
aVWhy don't we create a measure of progress that shows that?
p142
aVAnd what we do,
p143
aVis we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation
p144
aVis how successful is it
p145
aVat creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens.
p146
aVThat should be the goal
p147
aVof every nation on the planet.
p148
aVBut we have to remember
p149
aVthat there's a fundamental input to that,
p150
aVand that is how many of the planet's resources we use.
p151
aVWe all have one planet. We all have to share it.
p152
aVIt is the ultimate scarce resource,
p153
aVthe one planet that we share.
p154
aVAnd economics is very interested in scarcity.
p155
aVWhen it has a scarce resource
p156
aVthat it wants to turn into
p157
aVa desirable outcome,
p158
aVit thinks in terms of efficiency.
p159
aVIt thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck.
p160
aVAnd this is a measure of how much well-being
p161
aVwe get for our planetary resource use.
p162
aVIt is an efficiency measure.
p163
aVAnd probably the easiest way to show you that,
p164
aVis to show you this graph.
p165
aa(lp166
VRunning horizontally along the graph,
p167
aVis "ecological footprint,"
p168
aVwhich is a measure of how much resources we use
p169
aVand how much pressure we put on the planet.
p170
aVMore is bad.
p171
aVRunning vertically upwards,
p172
aVis a measure called "happy life years."
p173
aVIt's about the well-being of nations.
p174
aVIt's like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy.
p175
aVIt's like quality and quantity of life in nations.
p176
aVAnd the yellow dot there you see, is the global average.
p177
aVNow, there's a huge array of nations
p178
aVaround that global average.
p179
aVTo the top right of the graph,
p180
aVare countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being,
p181
aVbut they're using a lot of planet to get there.
p182
aVThey are the U.S.A.,
p183
aVother Western countries going across in those triangles
p184
aVand a few Gulf states in there actually.
p185
aVConversely, at the bottom left of the graph,
p186
aVare countries that are not producing much well-being \u2014
p187
aVtypically, sub-Saharan Africa.
p188
aVIn Hobbesian terms,
p189
aVlife is short and brutish there.
p190
aVThe average life expectancy in many of these countries
p191
aVis only 40 years.
p192
aVMalaria, HIV/AIDS
p193
aVare killing a lot of people
p194
aVin these regions of the world.
p195
aa(lp196
VBut now for the good news!
p197
aVThere are some countries up there, yellow triangles,
p198
aVthat are doing better than global average,
p199
aVthat are heading up towards the top left of the graph.
p200
aVThis is an aspirational graph.
p201
aVWe want to be top left, where good lives don't cost the earth.
p202
aVThey're Latin American.
p203
aVThe country on its own up at the top
p204
aVis a place I haven't been to.
p205
aVMaybe some of you have.
p206
aVCosta Rica.
p207
aVCosta Rica \u2014
p208
aVaverage life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years.
p209
aVThat is longer than in the USA.
p210
aVThey are, according to the latest Gallup world poll,
p211
aVthe happiest nation on the planet \u2014
p212
aVthan anybody; more than Switzerland and Denmark.
p213
aVThey are the happiest place.
p214
aVThey are doing that
p215
aVon a quarter of the resources
p216
aVthat are used typically in [the] Western world \u2014
p217
aVa quarter of the resources.
p218
aa(lp219
VWhat's going on there?
p220
aVWhat's happening in Costa Rica?
p221
aVWe can look at some of the data.
p222
aV99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources.
p223
aVTheir government is one of the first to commit
p224
aVto be carbon neutral by 2021.
p225
aVThey abolished the army
p226
aVin 1949 \u2014
p227
aV1949.
p228
aVAnd they invested in social programs \u2014
p229
aVhealth and education.
p230
aVThey have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America
p231
aVand in the world.
p232
aVAnd they have that Latin vibe, don't they.
p233
aVThey have the social connectedness.
p234
aV(Laughter)
p235
aVThe challenge is, that possibly \u2014 and the thing we might have to think about \u2014
p236
aVis that the future
p237
aVmight not be North American,
p238
aVmight not be Western European.
p239
aVIt might be Latin American.
p240
aVAnd the challenge, really,
p241
aVis to pull the global average up here.
p242
aVThat's what we need to do.
p243
aVAnd if we're going to do that,
p244
aVwe need to pull countries from the bottom,
p245
aVand we need to pull countries from the right of the graph.
p246
aVAnd then we're starting to create a happy planet.
p247
aVThat's one way of looking at it.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnother way of looking at it is looking at time trends.
p250
aVWe don't have good data going back for every country in the world,
p251
aVbut for some of the richest countries, the OECD group, we do.
p252
aVAnd this is the trend in well-being over that time,
p253
aVa small increase,
p254
aVbut this is the trend in ecological footprint.
p255
aVAnd so in strict happy-planet methodology,
p256
aVwe've become less efficient
p257
aVat turning our ultimate scarce resource
p258
aVinto the outcome we want to.
p259
aVAnd the point really is, is that I think,
p260
aVprobably everybody in this room
p261
aVwould like society to get to 2050
p262
aVwithout an apocalyptic
p263
aVsomething happening.
p264
aVIt's actually not very long away.
p265
aVIt's half a human lifetime away.
p266
aVA child entering school today
p267
aVwill be my age in 2050.
p268
aVThis is not the very distant future.
p269
aVThis is what the U.K. government target
p270
aVon carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like.
p271
aVAnd I put it to you, that is not business as usual.
p272
aVThat is changing our business.
p273
aVThat is changing the way we create our organizations,
p274
aVwe do our government policy and we live our lives.
p275
aVAnd the point is,
p276
aVwe need to carry on increasing well-being.
p277
aVNo one can go to the polls
p278
aVand say that quality of life is going to reduce.
p279
aVNone of us, I think,
p280
aVwant human progress to stop.
p281
aVI think we want it to carry on.
p282
aVI think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing.
p283
aVAnd I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in.
p284
aVI think this is what they want. They want quality of life to keep increasing.
p285
aVThey want to hold on to what they've got.
p286
aVAnd if we're going to engage them,
p287
aVI think that's what we've got to do.
p288
aVAnd that means we have to really increase efficiency even more.
p289
aa(lp290
VNow that's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that,
p291
aVbut the point is we need to turn those curves.
p292
aVAnd this is where I think we can take a leaf
p293
aVout of systems theory, systems engineers,
p294
aVwhere they create feedback loops,
p295
aVput the right information at the right point of time.
p296
aVHuman beings are very motivated by the "now."
p297
aVYou put a smart meter in your home,
p298
aVand you see how much electricity you're using right now,
p299
aVhow much it's costing you,
p300
aVyour kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly.
p301
aVWhat would that look like for society?
p302
aVWhy is it, on the radio news every evening,
p303
aVI hear the FTSE 100, the Dow Jones, the dollar pound ratio \u2014
p304
aVI don't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news.
p305
aVAnd why do I hear that?
p306
aVWhy don't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday,
p307
aVor American used yesterday?
p308
aVDid we meet our three percent annual target
p309
aVon reducing carbon emissions?
p310
aVThat's how you create a collective goal.
p311
aVYou put it out there into the media and start thinking about it.
p312
aVAnd we need positive feedback loops
p313
aVfor increasing well-being
p314
aVAt a government level, they might create national accounts of well-being.
p315
aVAt a business level, you might look at the well-being of your employees,
p316
aVwhich we know is really linked to creativity,
p317
aVwhich is linked to innovation,
p318
aVand we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues.
p319
aVAt a personal level, we need these nudges too.
p320
aVMaybe we don't quite need the data, but we need reminders.
p321
aVIn the U.K., we have a strong public health message
p322
aVon five fruit and vegetables a day
p323
aVand how much exercise we should do \u2014 never my best thing.
p324
aVWhat are these for happiness?
p325
aVWhat are the five things that you should do every day
p326
aVto be happier?
p327
aa(lp328
VWe did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago,
p329
aVa big program called the Foresight program \u2014
p330
aVlots and lots of people \u2014 involved lots of experts \u2014
p331
aVeverything evidence based \u2014 a huge tome.
p332
aVBut a piece of work we did was on: what five positive actions can you do
p333
aVto improve well-being in your life?
p334
aVAnd the point of these is
p335
aVthey are, not quite, the secrets of happiness,
p336
aVbut they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from.
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd the first of these is to connect,
p339
aVis that your social relationships
p340
aVare the most important cornerstones of your life.
p341
aVDo you invest the time with your loved ones
p342
aVthat you could do, and energy?
p343
aVKeep building them.
p344
aVThe second one is be active.
p345
aVThe fastest way out of a bad mood:
p346
aVstep outside, go for a walk, turn the radio on and dance.
p347
aVBeing active is great for our positive mood.
p348
aVThe third one is take notice.
p349
aVHow aware are you of things going on around the world,
p350
aVthe seasons changing, people around you?
p351
aVDo you notice what's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge?
p352
aVBased on a lot of evidence for mindfulness,
p353
aVcognitive behavioral therapy,
p354
aV[very] strong for our well being.
p355
aVThe fourth is keep learning
p356
aVand keep is important \u2014
p357
aVlearning throughout the whole life course.
p358
aVOlder people who keep learning and are curious,
p359
aVthey have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down.
p360
aVBut it doesn't have to be formal learning; it's not knowledge based.
p361
aVIt's more curiosity.
p362
aVIt can be learning to cook a new dish,
p363
aVpicking up an instrument you forgot as a child.
p364
aVKeep learning.
p365
aVAnd the final one
p366
aVis that most anti-economic of activities,
p367
aVbut give.
p368
aVOur generosity, our altruism,
p369
aVour compassion,
p370
aVare all hardwired
p371
aVto the reward mechanism in our brain.
p372
aVWe feel good if we give.
p373
aVYou can do an experiment where you give
p374
aVtwo groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning.
p375
aVYou tell one of them to spend it on themselves
p376
aVand one on other people.
p377
aVYou measure their happiness at the end of the day,
p378
aVthose that have gone and spent on other people are much happier
p379
aVthat those that spent it on themselves.
p380
aa(lp381
VAnd these five ways,
p382
aVwhich we put onto these handy postcards,
p383
aVI would say, don't have to cost the earth.
p384
aVThey don't have any carbon content.
p385
aVThey don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied.
p386
aVAnd so I think it's really quite feasible
p387
aVthat happiness does not cost the earth.
p388
aVNow, Martin Luther King,
p389
aVon the eve of his death,
p390
aVgave an incredible speech.
p391
aVHe said, "I know there are challenges ahead,
p392
aVthere may be trouble ahead,
p393
aVbut I fear no one. I don't care.
p394
aVI have been to the mountain top,
p395
aVand I have seen the Promised Land."
p396
aVNow, he was a preacher,
p397
aVbut I believe the environmental movement
p398
aVand, in fact, the business community, government,
p399
aVneeds to go to the top of the mountain top,
p400
aVand it needs to look out,
p401
aVand it needs to see the Promised Land,
p402
aVor the land of promise,
p403
aVand it needs to have a vision
p404
aVof a world that we all want.
p405
aVAnd not only that, we need to create a Great Transition
p406
aVto get there,
p407
aVand we need to pave that great transition with good things.
p408
aa(lp409
VHuman beings want to be happy.
p410
aVPave them with the five ways.
p411
aVAnd we need to have signposts
p412
aVgathering people together and pointing them \u2014
p413
aVsomething like the Happy Planet Index.
p414
aVAnd then I believe
p415
aVthat we can all create a world we all want,
p416
aVwhere happiness does not cost the earth.
