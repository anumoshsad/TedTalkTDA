VWe can cut violent deaths around the world
p4
aVby 50 percent in the next three decades.
p5
aVAll we have to do is drop killing by 2.3 percent a year,
p6
aVand we'll hit that target.
p7
aa(lp8
VYou don't believe me?
p9
aVWell, the leading epidemiologists and criminologists around the world
p10
aVseem to think we can, and so do I,
p11
aVbut only if we focus on our cities, especially the most fragile ones.
p12
aa(lp13
VYou see, I've been thinking about this a lot.
p14
aVFor the last 20 years, I've been working
p15
aVin countries and cities ripped apart by conflict,
p16
aVviolence, terrorism, or some insidious combination of all.
p17
aVI've tracked gun smugglers from Russia to Somalia,
p18
aVI've worked with warlords in Afghanistan and the Congo,
p19
aVI've counted cadavers in Colombia, in  Haiti, in Sri Lanka, in Papua New Guinea.
p20
aVYou don't need to be on the front line, though,
p21
aVto get a sense that our planet is spinning out of control, right?
p22
aVThere's this feeling that international instability is the new normal.
p23
aVBut I want you to take a closer look,
p24
aVand I think you'll see that the geography of violence is changing,
p25
aVbecause it's not so much our nation states that are gripped by conflict and crime
p26
aVas our cities: Aleppo, Bamako, Caracas,  Erbil, Mosul, Tripoli, Salvador.
p27
aVViolence is migrating to the metropole.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd maybe this is to be expected, right?
p30
aVAfter all, most people today, they live in cities, not the countryside.
p31
aVJust 600 cities, including 30 megacities, account for two thirds of global GDP.
p32
aVBut when it comes to cities,
p33
aVthe conversation is dominated by the North,
p34
aVthat is, North America, Western Europe, Australia and Japan,
p35
aVwhere violence is  actually at historic lows.
p36
aVAs a result, city enthusiasts, they talk about the triumph of the city,
p37
aVof the creative classes, and the mayors that will rule the world.
p38
aVNow, I hope that mayors do one day rule the world,
p39
aVbut, you know, the fact is,
p40
aVwe don't hear any conversation, really, about what is happening in the South.
p41
aVAnd by South, I mean Latin America, Africa, Asia,
p42
aVwhere violence in some cases is accelerating,
p43
aVwhere infrastructure is overstretched,
p44
aVand where governance is sometimes an aspiration and not a reality.
p45
aa(lp46
VNow, some diplomats and development experts and specialists,
p47
aVthey talk about 40 to 50 fragile states
p48
aVthat will shape security in the 21st century.
p49
aVI think it's fragile cities which will define the future of order and disorder.
p50
aVThat's because warfare and humanitarian action
p51
aVare going to be concentrated in our cities,
p52
aVand the fight for development,
p53
aVwhether you define that as eradicating poverty,
p54
aVuniversal healthcare, beating back climate change,
p55
aVwill be won or lost in the shantytowns, slums and favelas of our cities.
p56
aVI want to talk to you about four megarisks
p57
aVthat I think will define fragility in our time,
p58
aVand if we can get to grips with these,
p59
aVI think we can do something with that lethal violence problem.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo let me start with some good news.
p62
aVFact is, we're living in the most peaceful moment in human history.
p63
aVSteven Pinker and others have shown how the intensity and frequency of conflict
p64
aVis actually at an all-time low.
p65
aVNow, Gaza, Syria, Sudan, Ukraine,
p66
aVas ghastly as these conflicts are, and they are horrific,
p67
aVthey represent a relatively small blip upwards
p68
aVin a 50-year-long secular decline.
p69
aVWhat's more, we're seeing a dramatic reduction in homicide.
p70
aVManuel Eisner and others have shown
p71
aVthat for centuries, we've seen this incredible drop in murder,
p72
aVespecially in the West.
p73
aVMost Northern cities today are 100 times safer than they were just 100 years ago.
p74
aa(lp75
VThese two facts \u2014 the decline in armed  conflict and the decline in murder \u2014
p76
aVare amongst the most extraordinary,
p77
aVif unheralded, accomplishments of human history,
p78
aVand we should be really excited, right?
p79
aVWell, yeah, we should.
p80
aVThere's just one problem: These two scourges are still with us.
p81
aVYou see, 525,000 people \u2014 men, women, boys and girls \u2014
p82
aVdie violently every single year.
p83
aVResearch I've been doing with Keith Krause and others
p84
aVhas shown that between 50,000 and 60,000 people are dying in war zones violently.
p85
aVThe rest, almost 500,000 people, are dying outside of conflict zones.
p86
aVIn other words, 10 times more people are dying outside of war than inside war.
p87
aVWhat's more, violence is moving south,
p88
aVto Latin America and the Caribbean,
p89
aVto parts of Central and Southern Africa,
p90
aVand to bits of the Middle East and Central Asia.
p91
aVForty of the 50 most dangerous  cities in the world
p92
aVare right here in Latin America,
p93
aV13 in Brazil,
p94
aVand the most dangerous of all, it's  San Pedro Sula, Honduras' second city,
p95
aVwith a staggering homicide rate of 187 murders per 100,000 people.
p96
aVThat's 23 times the global average.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow, if violence is re-concentrating geographically,
p99
aVit's also being reconfigured to the world's new topography,
p100
aVbecause when it comes to cities, the world ain't flat,
p101
aVlike Thomas Friedman likes to say.
p102
aVIt's spiky.
p103
aVThe dominance of the city as the primary mode of urban living
p104
aVis one of the most extraordinary demographic reversals in history,
p105
aVand it all happened so fast.
p106
aVYou all know the figures, right?
p107
aVThere's 7.3 billion people in the world today;
p108
aVthere will be 9.6 billion by 2050.
p109
aVBut consider this one fact:
p110
aVIn the 1800s, one in 30 people lived in cities,
p111
aVtoday it's one in two,
p112
aVand tomorrow virtually everyone is going to be there.
p113
aVAnd this expansion in urbanization is going to be neither even nor equitable.
p114
aVThe vast majority, 90 percent,
p115
aVwill be happening in the South, in cities of the South.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo urban geographers and demographers,
p118
aVthey tell us that it's not necessarily the size or even the density of cities
p119
aVthat predicts violence, no.
p120
aVTokyo, with 35 million people,
p121
aVis one of the largest, and some might say safest, urban metropolises in the world.
p122
aVNo, it's the speed of urbanization that matters.
p123
aVI call this turbo-urbanization, and it's  one of the key drivers of fragility.
p124
aa(lp125
VWhen you think about the incredible expansion of these cities,
p126
aVand you think about turbo-urbanization, think about Karachi.
p127
aVKarachi was about 500,000 people in 1947, a hustling, bustling city.
p128
aVToday, it's 21 million people,
p129
aVand apart from accounting for three quarters of Pakistan's GDP,
p130
aVit's also one of the most violent cities in South Asia.
p131
aVDhaka, Lagos, Kinshasa,
p132
aVthese cities are now 40 times larger than they were in the 1950s.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow take a look at New York.
p135
aVThe Big Apple, it took 150 years to get to eight million people.
p136
aVSão Paulo, Mexico City, took 15 to reach that same interval.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow, what do these medium, large, mega-, and hypercities look like?
p139
aVWhat is their profile?
p140
aVWell, for one thing, they're young.
p141
aVWhat we're seeing in many of them is the rise of the youth bulge.
p142
aVNow, this is actually a good news story.
p143
aVIt's a function of reductions in child mortality rates.
p144
aVBut the youth bulge is something we've got to watch.
p145
aVWhat it basically means
p146
aVis the proportion of young people living in our fragile cities
p147
aVis much larger than those living  in our healthier and wealthier ones.
p148
aVIn some fragile cities,
p149
aV75 percent of the population is under the age of 30.
p150
aVThink about that: Three in four people are under 30.
p151
aVIt's like Palo Alto on steroids.
p152
aVNow, if you look at Mogadishu for example,
p153
aVin Mogadishu the mean age is 16 years old.
p154
aVDitto for Dhaka, Dili and Kabul.
p155
aVAnd Tokyo? It's 46.
p156
aVSame for most Western European cities.
p157
aVNow, it's not just youth that necessarily predicts violence.
p158
aVThat's one factor among many,
p159
aVbut youthfulness combined with unemployment, lack of education,
p160
aVand \u2014 this is the kicker \u2014  being male, is a deadly proposition.
p161
aVThey're statistically correlated, all those risk factors, with youth,
p162
aVand they tend to relate to increases in violence.
p163
aa(lp164
VNow, for those of you who are parents of teenage sons,
p165
aVyou know what I'm talking about, right?
p166
aVJust imagine your boy without any structure
p167
aVwith those unruly friends of his, out there cavorting about.
p168
aVNow, take away the parents,
p169
aVtake away the education, limit the education possibilities,
p170
aVsprinkle in a little bit of drugs, alcohol and guns,
p171
aVand sit back and watch the fireworks.
p172
aVThe implications are disconcerting.
p173
aVRight here in Brazil, the life expectancy is 73.6 years.
p174
aVIf you live in Rio, I'm sorry, shave off two right there.
p175
aVBut if you're young, you're uneducated,
p176
aVyou lack employment, you're black, and you're male,
p177
aVyour life expectancy drops to less than 60 years old.
p178
aVThere's a reason why youthfulness and violence are the number one killers
p179
aVin this country.
p180
aa(lp181
VOkay, so it's not all doom and gloom in our cities.
p182
aVAfter all, cities are hubs of innovation,
p183
aVdynamism, prosperity,  excitement, connectivity.
p184
aVThey're where the smart people gather.
p185
aVAnd those young people I just mentioned,
p186
aVthey're more digitally savvy and tech-aware than ever before.
p187
aVAnd this explosion, the Internet, and mobile technology,
p188
aVmeans that the digital divide separating the North and the South
p189
aVbetween countries and within them, is shrinking.
p190
aVBut as we've heard so many times,
p191
aVthese new technologies are dual-edged, right?
p192
aVTake the case of law enforcement.
p193
aVPolice around the world are starting to use remote sensing and big data
p194
aVto anticipate crime.
p195
aVSome cops are able to predict criminal violence before it even happens.
p196
aVThe future crime scenario, it's here today,
p197
aVand we've got to be careful.
p198
aVWe have to manage the issues of the public safety
p199
aVagainst rights to individual privacy.
p200
aa(lp201
VBut it's not just the cops who are innovating.
p202
aVWe've heard extraordinary activities of civil society groups
p203
aVwho are engaging in local  and global collective action,
p204
aVand this is leading to digital protest and real revolution.
p205
aVBut most worrying of all are criminal gangs
p206
aVwho are going online and starting to colonize cyberspace.
p207
aVIn Ciudad Juárez in Mexico, where I've been working,
p208
aVgroups like the Zetas and the Sinaloa cartel
p209
aVare hijacking social media.
p210
aVThey're using it to recruit, to sell their products,
p211
aVto coerce, to intimidate and to kill.
p212
aVViolence is going virtual.
p213
aa(lp214
VSo this is just a partial sketch
p215
aVof a fast-moving and dynamic and complex situation.
p216
aVI mean, there are many other megarisks
p217
aVthat are going to define fragility in our time,
p218
aVnot least income inequality,
p219
aVpoverty, climate change, impunity.
p220
aVBut we're facing a stark dilemma
p221
aVwhere some cities are going to thrive and drive global growth
p222
aVand others are going to stumble and pull it backwards.
p223
aVIf we're going to change course, we need to start a conversation.
p224
aVWe can't only focus on those cities that work,
p225
aVthe Singapores, the Kuala Lumpurs,
p226
aVthe Dubais, the Shanghais.
p227
aVWe've got to bring those fragile cities into the conversation.
p228
aa(lp229
VOne way to do this might be to start twinning
p230
aVour fragile cities with our healthier and wealthier ones,
p231
aVkickstarting a process of learning and collaboration
p232
aVand sharing of practices, of what works and what doesn't.
p233
aVA wonderful example of this is coming from El Salvador and Los Angeles,
p234
aVwhere the mayors in San Salvador and Los Angeles are collaborating
p235
aVon getting ex-gang members to work with current gang members,
p236
aVoffering tutoring, education,
p237
aVand in the process are helping incubate cease-fires and truces,
p238
aVand we've seen homicide rates go down in San Salvador,
p239
aVonce the world's most violent city,
p240
aVby 50 percent.
p241
aVWe can also focus  on hot cities, but also hot spots.
p242
aVPlace and location matter fundamentally in shaping violence in our cities.
p243
aVDid you know that between one and two percent
p244
aVof street addresses in any fragile city
p245
aVcan predict up to 99 percent of violent crime?
p246
aVTake the case of São Paulo, where I've been working.
p247
aVIt's gone from being Brazil's most dangerous city to one of its safest,
p248
aVand it did this by doubling down
p249
aVon information collection, hot spot mapping, and police reform,
p250
aVand in the process, it dropped homicide by 70 percent in just over 10 years.
p251
aVWe also got to focus on those hot people.
p252
aVIt's tragic, but being young, unemployed, uneducated, male,
p253
aVincreases the risks of being killed and killing.
p254
aVWe have to break this cycle of violence
p255
aVand get in there early with our children, our youngest children,
p256
aVand valorize them, not stigmatize them.
p257
aVThere's wonderful work that's happening that I've been involved with
p258
aVin Kingston, Jamaica and right here in Rio,
p259
aVwhich is putting education, employment, recreation
p260
aVup front for these high-risk groups,
p261
aVand as a result, we're seeing violence going down in their communities.
p262
aa(lp263
VWe've also got to make our cities safer, more inclusive, and livable for all.
p264
aVThe fact is, social cohesion matters.
p265
aVMobility matters in our cities.
p266
aVWe've got to get away from this model of segregation, exclusion,
p267
aVand cities with walls.
p268
aVMy favorite example of how to do this comes from Medellín.
p269
aVWhen I lived in Colombia in the late 1990s,
p270
aVMedellín was the murder capital  of the world, but it changed course,
p271
aVand it did this by deliberately investing in its low-income and most violent areas
p272
aVand integrating them with the middle-class ones
p273
aVthrough a network of cable cars,
p274
aVof public transport, and first-class infrastructure,
p275
aVand in the process, it dropped homicide by 79 percent in just under two decades.
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd finally, there's technology.
p278
aVTechnology has enormous promise but also peril.
p279
aVWe've seen examples here of extraordinary innovation,
p280
aVand much of it coming from this room,
p281
aVThe police are engaging  in predictive analytics.
p282
aVCitizens are engaging in new crowdsourcing solutions.
p283
aVEven my own group is involved in developing applications
p284
aVto provide more accountability over police and increase safety among citizens.
p285
aVBut we need to be careful.
p286
aa(lp287
VIf I have one single message for you, it's this:
p288
aVThere is nothing inevitable about lethal violence,
p289
aVand we can make our cities safer.
p290
aVFolks, we have the opportunity of a lifetime to drop homicidal violence
p291
aVin half within our lifetime.
p292
aVSo I have just one question:
p293
aVWhat are we waiting for?
p294
aa(lp295
VThank you.
