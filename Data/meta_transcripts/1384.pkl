VI want to discuss with you this afternoon
p4
aVwhy you're going to fail to have a great career.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VI'm an economist.
p9
aa(lp10
VI do dismal.
p11
aVEnd of the day, it's ready for dismal remarks.
p12
aVI only want to talk to those of you who want a great career.
p13
aVI know some of you have already decided you want a good career.
p14
aVYou're going to fail, too.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VBecause \u2014 goodness, you're all cheery about failing.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VCanadian group, undoubtedly.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VThose trying to have good careers are going to fail,
p27
aVbecause, really, good jobs are now disappearing.
p28
aVThere are great jobs and great careers,
p29
aVand then there are the high-workload,
p30
aVhigh-stress, bloodsucking, soul-destroying kinds of jobs,
p31
aVand practically nothing in-between.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo people looking for good jobs are going to fail.
p34
aVI want to talk about those looking for great jobs, great careers,
p35
aVand why you're going to fail.
p36
aVFirst reason is that no matter how many times people tell you,
p37
aV"If you want a great career, you have to pursue your passion,
p38
aVyou have to pursue your dreams, you have to pursue
p39
aVthe greatest fascination in your life,"
p40
aVyou hear it again and again, and then you decide not to do it.
p41
aVIt doesn't matter how many times you download
p42
aVSteven J.'s Stanford commencement address,
p43
aVyou still look at it and decide not to do it.
p44
aa(lp45
VI'm not quite sure why you decide not to do it.
p46
aVYou're too lazy to do it. It's too hard.
p47
aVYou're afraid if you look for your passion and don't find it,
p48
aVyou'll feel like you're an idiot, so then you make excuses
p49
aVabout why you're not going to look for your passion.
p50
aVThey are excuses, ladies and gentlemen.
p51
aVWe're going to go through a whole long list \u2014
p52
aVyour creativity in thinking of excuses not to do what you really need to do
p53
aVif you want to have a great career.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo, for example, one of your great excuses is:
p56
aa(lp57
V(Sigh)
p58
aa(lp59
V"Well, great careers are really and truly, for most people,
p60
aVjust a matter of luck.
p61
aVSo I'm going to stand around, I'm going to try to be lucky,
p62
aVand if I'm lucky, I'll have a great career.
p63
aVIf not, I'll have a good career."
p64
aVBut a good career is an impossibility, so that's not going to work.
p65
aa(lp66
VThen, your other excuse is,
p67
aV"Yes, there are special people who pursue their passions,
p68
aVbut they are geniuses.
p69
aVThey are Steven J.
p70
aVI'm not a genius.
p71
aVWhen I was five, I thought I was a genius,
p72
aVbut my professors have beaten that idea out of my head long since."
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
V"And now I know I am completely competent."
p77
aVNow, you see, if this was 1950,
p78
aVbeing completely competent \u2014
p79
aVthat would have given you a great career.
p80
aVBut guess what?
p81
aVThis is almost 2012, and saying to the world,
p82
aV"I am totally, completely competent,"
p83
aVis damning yourself with the faintest of praise.
p84
aa(lp85
VAnd then, of course, another excuse:
p86
aV"Well, I would do this, I would do this, but, but \u2014
p87
aVwell, after all, I'm not weird.
p88
aVEverybody knows that people who pursue their passions
p89
aVare somewhat obsessive.
p90
aVA little strange.
p91
aVHmm? Hmm? Okay?
p92
aVYou know, a fine line between madness and genius.
p93
aV"I'm not weird. I've read Steven J.'s biography.
p94
aVOh my goodness \u2014 I'm not that person. I am nice.
p95
aVI am normal.
p96
aVI'm a nice, normal person, and nice, normal people \u2014
p97
aVdon't have passion."
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
V"Ah, but I still want a great career.
p102
aVI'm not prepared to pursue my passion,
p103
aVso I know what I'm going to do,
p104
aVbecause I have a solution.
p105
aVI have a strategy.
p106
aVIt's the one Mommy and Daddy told me about.
p107
aVMommy and Daddy told me that if I worked hard,
p108
aVI'd have a good career.
p109
aVSo, if you work hard and have a good career,
p110
aVif you work really, really, really hard,
p111
aVyou'll have a great career.
p112
aVDoesn't that, like, mathematically make sense?"
p113
aVHmm. Not.
p114
aVBut you've managed to talk yourself into that.
p115
aa(lp116
VYou know what? Here's a little secret:
p117
aVYou want to work? You want to work really, really, really hard?
p118
aVYou know what? You'll succeed.
p119
aVThe world will give you the opportunity
p120
aVto work really, really, really, really hard.
p121
aVBut, are you so sure
p122
aVthat that's going to give you a great career,
p123
aVwhen all the evidence is to the contrary?
p124
aa(lp125
VSo let's deal with those of you who are trying to find your passion.
p126
aVYou actually understand that you really had better do it,
p127
aVnever mind the excuses.
p128
aVYou're trying to find your passion \u2014
p129
aa(lp130
V(Sigh)
p131
aa(lp132
Vand you're so happy.
p133
aVYou found something you're interested in.
p134
aa(lp135
V"I have an interest! I have an interest!"
p136
aa(lp137
VYou tell me.
p138
aVYou say, "I have an interest!" I say, "That's wonderful!
p139
aVAnd what are you trying to tell me?"
p140
aV"Well, I have an interest."
p141
aVI say, "Do you have passion?"
p142
aV"I have an interest," you say.
p143
aV"Your interest is compared to what?"
p144
aV"Well, I'm interested in this."
p145
aV"And what about the rest of humanity's activities?"
p146
aV"I'm not interested in them."
p147
aV"You've looked at them all, have you?"
p148
aV"No. Not exactly."
p149
aa(lp150
VPassion is your greatest love.
p151
aVPassion is the thing
p152
aVthat will help you create the highest expression of your talent.
p153
aVPassion, interest \u2014 it's not the same thing.
p154
aVAre you really going to go to your sweetie and say,
p155
aV"Marry me! You're interesting."
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VWon't happen.
p160
aVWon't happen, and you will die alone.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VWhat you want,
p165
aVwhat you want, what you want,
p166
aVis passion.
p167
aVIt is beyond interest.
p168
aVYou need 20 interests, and then one of them,
p169
aVone of them might grab you,
p170
aVone of them might engage you more than anything else,
p171
aVand then you may have found your greatest love,
p172
aVin comparison to all the other things that interest you,
p173
aVand that's what passion is.
p174
aa(lp175
VI have a friend, proposed to his sweetie.
p176
aVHe was an economically rational person.
p177
aVHe said to his sweetie, "Let us marry.
p178
aVLet us merge our interests."
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VYes, he did.
p183
aa(lp184
V"I love you truly," he said. "I love you deeply.
p185
aVI love you more than any other woman I've ever encountered.
p186
aVI love you more than Mary, Jane, Susie, Penelope,
p187
aVIngrid, Gertrude, Gretel \u2014
p188
aVI was on a German exchange program then.
p189
aVI love you more than \u2014"
p190
aVAll right.
p191
aVShe left the room
p192
aVhalfway through his enumeration of his love for her.
p193
aVAfter he got over his surprise at being, you know, turned down,
p194
aVhe concluded he'd had a narrow escape
p195
aVfrom marrying an irrational person.
p196
aVAlthough, he did make a note to himself that the next time he proposed,
p197
aVit was perhaps not necessary
p198
aVto enumerate all of the women he had auditioned for the part.
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VBut the point stands.
p203
aVYou must look for alternatives so that you find your destiny,
p204
aVor are you afraid of the word "destiny"?
p205
aVDoes the word "destiny" scare you?
p206
aVThat's what we're talking about.
p207
aVAnd if you don't find the highest expression of your talent,
p208
aVif you settle for "interesting," what the hell ever that means,
p209
aVdo you know what will happen at the end of your long life?
p210
aVYour friends and family will be gathered in the cemetery,
p211
aVand there beside your gravesite will be a tombstone,
p212
aVand inscribed on that tombstone
p213
aVit will say, "Here lies a distinguished engineer,
p214
aVwho invented Velcro."
p215
aVBut what that tombstone should have said,
p216
aVin an alternative lifetime,
p217
aVwhat it should have said if it was your highest expression of talent,
p218
aVwas, "Here lies the last Nobel Laureate in Physics,
p219
aVwho formulated the Grand Unified Field Theory
p220
aVand demonstrated the practicality of warp drive."
p221
aa(lp222
V(Laughter)
p223
aa(lp224
VVelcro, indeed!
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VOne was a great career.
p229
aVOne was a missed opportunity.
p230
aVBut then, there are some of you who,
p231
aVin spite of all these excuses, you will find,
p232
aVyou will find your passion.
p233
aVAnd you'll still fail.
p234
aa(lp235
VYou're going to fail, because \u2014
p236
aVbecause you're not going to do it,
p237
aVbecause you will have invented a new excuse,
p238
aVany excuse to fail to take action,
p239
aVand this excuse, I've heard so many times:
p240
aV"Yes, I would pursue a great career,
p241
aVbut, I value human relationships \u2014
p242
aa(lp243
V(Laughter)
p244
aa(lp245
Vmore than accomplishment.
p246
aVI want to be a great friend.
p247
aVI want to be a great spouse.
p248
aVI want to be a great parent,
p249
aVand I will not sacrifice them
p250
aVon the altar of great accomplishment."
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VWhat do you want me to say?
p255
aVNow, do you really want me to say now, tell you,
p256
aV"Really, I swear I don't kick children."
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VLook at the worldview you've given yourself.
p261
aVYou're a hero no matter what.
p262
aVAnd I, by suggesting ever so delicately
p263
aVthat you might want a great career, must hate children.
p264
aVI don't hate children. I don't kick them.
p265
aVYes, there was a little kid wandering through this building
p266
aVwhen I came here, and no, I didn't kick him.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VCourse, I had to tell him the building was for adults only,
p271
aVand to get out.
p272
aVHe mumbled something about his mother,
p273
aVand I told him she'd probably find him outside anyway.
p274
aVLast time I saw him, he was on the stairs crying.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Laughter)
p277
aa(lp278
VWhat a wimp.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Laughter)
p281
aa(lp282
VBut what do you mean? That's what you expect me to say.
p283
aVDo you really think it's appropriate
p284
aVthat you should actually take children and use them as a shield?
p285
aVYou know what will happen someday,
p286
aVyou ideal parent, you?
p287
aVThe kid will come to you someday and say,
p288
aV"I know what I want to be.
p289
aVI know what I'm going to do with my life."
p290
aVYou are so happy.
p291
aVIt's the conversation a parent wants to hear,
p292
aVbecause your kid's good in math,
p293
aVand you know you're going to like what comes next.
p294
aVSays your kid,
p295
aV"I have decided I want to be a magician.
p296
aVI want to perform magic tricks on the stage."
p297
aa(lp298
V(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
VAnd what do you say?
p301
aVYou say, you say,
p302
aV"That's risky, kid.
p303
aVMight fail, kid. Don't make a lot of money at that, kid.
p304
aVI don't know, kid, you should think about that again, kid.
p305
aVYou're so good at math, why don't you \u2014"
p306
aa(lp307
VThe kid interrupts you and says,
p308
aV"But it is my dream. It is my dream to do this."
p309
aVAnd what are you going to say?
p310
aVYou know what you're going to say?
p311
aV"Look kid. I had a dream once, too, but \u2014
p312
aVBut \u2014"
p313
aVSo how are you going to finish the sentence with your "but"?
p314
aV"But. I had a dream too, once, kid, but I was afraid to pursue it."
p315
aVOr are you going to tell him this:
p316
aV"I had a dream once, kid.
p317
aVBut then, you were born."
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
V(Applause)
p322
aa(lp323
VDo you really want to use your family,
p324
aVdo you really ever want to look at your spouse and your kid,
p325
aVand see your jailers?
p326
aVThere was something you could have said to your kid,
p327
aVwhen he or she said, "I have a dream."
p328
aVYou could have said \u2014
p329
aVlooked the kid in the face and said,
p330
aV"Go for it, kid!
p331
aVJust like I did."
p332
aVBut you won't be able to say that,
p333
aVbecause you didn't.
p334
aVSo you can't.
p335
aa(lp336
V(Laughter)
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd so the sins of the parents
p339
aVare visited on the poor children.
p340
aVWhy will you seek refuge in human relationships
p341
aVas your excuse not to find and pursue your passion?
p342
aVYou know why.
p343
aVIn your heart of hearts, you know why,
p344
aVand I'm being deadly serious.
p345
aVYou know why you would get all warm and fuzzy
p346
aVand wrap yourself up in human relationships.
p347
aVIt is because you are \u2014
p348
aVyou know what you are.
p349
aa(lp350
VYou're afraid to pursue your passion.
p351
aVYou're afraid to look ridiculous.
p352
aVYou're afraid to try.
p353
aVYou're afraid you may fail.
p354
aVGreat friend, great spouse, great parent, great career.
p355
aVIs that not a package? Is that not who you are?
p356
aVHow can you be one without the other?
p357
aVBut you're afraid.
p358
aa(lp359
VAnd that's why you're not going to have a great career.
p360
aVUnless \u2014
p361
aV"unless," that most evocative of all English words \u2014
p362
aV"unless."
p363
aVBut the "unless" word is also attached
p364
aVto that other, most terrifying phrase,
p365
aV"If only I had ..."
p366
aV"If only I had ..."
p367
aVIf you ever have that thought ricocheting in your brain,
p368
aVit will hurt a lot.
p369
aa(lp370
VSo, those are the many reasons
p371
aVwhy you are going to fail
p372
aVto have a great career.
p373
aVUnless \u2014
p374
aa(lp375
VUnless.
p376
aa(lp377
VThank you.
