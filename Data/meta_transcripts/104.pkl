VIn 1962, with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring,"
p4
aVI think for people like me in the world of the making of things,
p5
aVthe canary in the mine wasn't singing.
p6
aVAnd so the question that we might not have birds
p7
aVbecame kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around
p8
aVlooking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared.
p9
aVAnd the question was, were the birds singing?
p10
aVNow, I'm not a scientist, that'll be really clear.
p11
aVBut, you know, we've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be.
p12
aVWhat is a bird?
p13
aVWell, in my world, this is a rubber duck.
p14
aVIt comes in California with a warning \u2014
p15
aV"This product contains chemicals known by the State of California
p16
aVto cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."
p17
aVThis is a bird.
p18
aVWhat kind of culture would produce a product of this kind
p19
aVand then label it and sell it to children?
p20
aVI think we have a design problem.
p21
aa(lp22
VSomeone heard the six hours of talk that I gave
p23
aVcalled "The Monticello Dialogues" on NPR, and sent me this as a thank you note \u2014
p24
aV"We realize that design is a signal of intention,
p25
aVbut it also has to occur within a world,
p26
aVand we have to understand that world in order to
p27
aVimbue our designs with inherent intelligence,
p28
aVand so as we look back at the basic state of affairs
p29
aVin which we design, we, in a way, need to go to the primordial condition
p30
aVto understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet,
p31
aVand I think the exciting part of that is the good news that's there,
p32
aVbecause the news is the news of abundance,
p33
aVand not the news of limits,
p34
aVand I think as our culture tortures itself now
p35
aVwith tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear,
p36
aVwe can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent,
p37
aVdriven by the sun, and start to imagine
p38
aVwhat that would be like to share."
p39
aVThat was a nice thing to get.
p40
aVThat was one sentence.
p41
aVHenry James would be proud.
p42
aVThis is \u2014 I put it down at the bottom,
p43
aVbut that was extemporaneous, obviously.
p44
aa(lp45
VThe fundamental issue is that, for me,
p46
aVdesign is the first signal of human intentions.
p47
aVSo what are our intentions, and what would our intentions be \u2014
p48
aVif we wake up in the morning, we have designs on the world \u2014
p49
aVwell, what would our intention be as a species
p50
aVnow that we're the dominant species?
p51
aVAnd it's not just stewardship and dominion debate,
p52
aVbecause really, dominion is implicit in stewardship \u2014
p53
aVbecause how could you dominate something you had killed?
p54
aVAnd stewardship's implicit in dominion,
p55
aVbecause you can't be steward of something if you can't dominate it.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo the question is, what is the first question for designers?
p58
aVNow, as guardians \u2014 let's say the state, for example,
p59
aVwhich reserves the right to kill, the right to be duplicitous and so on \u2014
p60
aVthe question we're asking the guardian at this point is
p61
aVare we meant, how are we meant,
p62
aVto secure local societies, create world peace
p63
aVand save the environment?
p64
aVBut I don't know that that's the common debate.
p65
aa(lp66
VCommerce, on the other hand, is relatively quick,
p67
aVessentially creative, highly effective and efficient,
p68
aVand fundamentally honest, because we can't exchange
p69
aVvalue for very long if we don't trust each other.
p70
aVSo we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work,
p71
aVbut the question we bring to it is,
p72
aVhow do we love all the children of all species for all time?
p73
aVAnd so we start our designs with that question.
p74
aVBecause what we realize today is that modern culture
p75
aVappears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy.
p76
aVIf we come here and say, "Well, I didn't intend
p77
aVto cause global warming on the way here,"
p78
aVand we say, "That's not part of my plan,"
p79
aVthen we realize it's part of our de facto plan.
p80
aVBecause it's the thing that's happening because we have no other plan.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd I was at the White House for President Bush,
p83
aVmeeting with every federal department and agency,
p84
aVand I pointed out that they appear to have no plan.
p85
aVIf the end game is global warming, they're doing great.
p86
aVIf the end game is mercury toxification of our children
p87
aVdownwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the Clean Air Act,
p88
aVthen I see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as,
p89
aV"Brain death for all children. No child left behind."
p90
aa(lp91
V(Applause)
p92
aa(lp93
VSo, the question is, how many federal officials
p94
aVare ready to move to Ohio and Pennsylvania with their families?
p95
aVSo if you don't have an endgame of something delightful,
p96
aVthen you're just moving chess pieces around,
p97
aVif you don't know you're taking the king.
p98
aVSo perhaps we could develop a strategy of change,
p99
aVwhich requires humility. And in my business as an architect,
p100
aVit's unfortunate the word "humility" and the word "architect"
p101
aVhave not appeared in the same paragraph since "The Fountainhead."
p102
aVSo if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility,
p103
aVreflect on this \u2014 it took us 5,000 years
p104
aVto put wheels on our luggage.
p105
aVSo, as Kevin Kelly pointed out, there is no endgame.
p106
aVThere is an infinite game, and we're playing in that infinite game.
p107
aVAnd so we call it "cradle to cradle,"
p108
aVand our goal is very simple.
p109
aa(lp110
VThis is what I presented to the White House.
p111
aVOur goal is a delightfully diverse, safe, healthy and just world,
p112
aVwith clean air, clean water, soil and power \u2014
p113
aVeconomically, equitably, ecologically and elegantly enjoyed, period.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Applause)
p116
aa(lp117
VWhat don't you like about this?
p118
aVWhich part of this don't you like?
p119
aVSo we realized we want full diversity,
p120
aVeven though it can be difficult to remember what De Gaulle said
p121
aVwhen asked what it was like to be President of France.
p122
aVHe said, "What do you think it's like trying to run a country with 400 kinds of cheese?"
p123
aVBut at the same time, we realize that our products are not safe and healthy.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo we've designed products
p126
aVand we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million.
p127
aVThis is a baby blanket by Pendleton that will give your child nutrition
p128
aVinstead of Alzheimer's later in life.
p129
aVWe can ask ourselves, what is justice,
p130
aVand is justice blind, or is justice blindness?
p131
aVAnd at what point did that uniform turn from white to black?
p132
aVWater has been declared a human right by the United Nations.
p133
aVAir quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes.
p134
aVIs there anybody here who doesn't breathe?
p135
aVClean soil is a critical problem \u2014 the nitrification, the dead zones
p136
aVin the Gulf of Mexico.
p137
aVA fundamental issue that's not being addressed.
p138
aVWe've seen the first form of solar energy
p139
aVthat's beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of wind
p140
aVhere in the Great Plains, and so that hegemony is leaving.
p141
aVAnd if we remember Sheikh Yamani when he formed OPEC,
p142
aVthey asked him, "When will we see the end of the age of oil?"
p143
aVI don't know if you remember his answer, but it was,
p144
aV"The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones."
p145
aVWe see that companies acting ethically in this world
p146
aVare outperforming those that don't.
p147
aVWe see the flows of materials in a rather terrifying prospect.
p148
aVThis is a hospital monitor from Los Angeles, sent to China.
p149
aVThis woman will expose herself to toxic phosphorous,
p150
aVrelease four pounds of toxic lead into her childrens' environment,
p151
aVwhich is from copper.
p152
aa(lp153
VOn the other hand, we see great signs of hope.
p154
aVHere's Dr. Venkataswamy in India, who's figured out
p155
aVhow to do mass-produced health.
p156
aVHe has given eyesight to two million people for free.
p157
aVWe see in our material flows that car steels don't become car steel again
p158
aVbecause of the contaminants of the coatings \u2014
p159
aVbismuth, antimony, copper and so on.
p160
aVThey become building steel.
p161
aVOn the other hand, we're working with Berkshire Hathaway,
p162
aVWarren Buffett and Shaw Carpet,
p163
aVthe largest carpet company in the world.
p164
aVWe've developed a carpet that is continuously recyclable,
p165
aVdown to the parts per million.
p166
aVThe upper is Nylon 6 that can go back to caprolactam,
p167
aVthe bottom, a polyolephine \u2014 infinitely recyclable thermoplastic.
p168
aVNow if I was a bird, the building on my left is a liability.
p169
aVThe building on my right, which is our corporate campus for The Gap
p170
aVwith an ancient meadow, is an asset \u2014 its nesting grounds.
p171
aa(lp172
VHere's where I come from. I grew up in Hong Kong,
p173
aVwith six million people in 40 square miles.
p174
aVDuring the dry season, we had four hours of water every fourth day.
p175
aVAnd the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have been
p176
aVfarming the same piece of ground for 40 centuries.
p177
aVYou can't farm the same piece of ground for 40 centuries
p178
aVwithout understanding nutrient flow.
p179
aVMy childhood summers were in the Puget Sound of Washington,
p180
aVamong the first growth and big growth.
p181
aVMy grandfather had been a lumberjack in the Olympics,
p182
aVso I have a lot of tree karma I am working off.
p183
aVI went to Yale for graduate school,
p184
aVstudied in a building of this style by Le Corbusier,
p185
aVaffectionately known in our business as Brutalism.
p186
aVIf we look at the world of architecture,
p187
aVwe see with Mies' 1928 tower for Berlin,
p188
aVthe question might be, "Well, where's the sun?"
p189
aVAnd this might have worked in Berlin, but we built it in Houston,
p190
aVand the windows are all closed. And with most products
p191
aVappearing not to have been designed for indoor use,
p192
aVthis is actually a vertical gas chamber.
p193
aa(lp194
VWhen I went to Yale, we had the first energy crisis,
p195
aVand I was designing the first solar-heated house in Ireland
p196
aVas a student, which I then built \u2014
p197
aVwhich would give you a sense of my ambition.
p198
aVAnd Richard Meier, who was one of my teachers,
p199
aVkept coming over to my desk to give me criticism,
p200
aVand he would say, "Bill, you've got to understand- \u2014
p201
aVsolar energy has nothing to do with architecture."
p202
aVI guess he didn't read Vitruvius.
p203
aVIn 1984, we did the first so-called "green office" in America
p204
aVfor Environmental Defense.
p205
aVWe started asking manufacturers what were in their materials.
p206
aVThey said, "They're proprietary, they're legal, go away."
p207
aVThe only indoor quality work done in this country at that time
p208
aVwas sponsored by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company,
p209
aVand it was to prove there was no danger
p210
aVfrom secondhand smoke in the workplace.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo, all of a sudden, here I am, graduating from high school in 1969,
p213
aVand this happens, and we realize that "away" went away.
p214
aVRemember we used to throw things away, and we'd point to away?
p215
aVAnd yet, NOAA has now shown us, for example \u2014
p216
aVyou see that little blue thing above Hawaii?
p217
aVThat's the Pacific Gyre.
p218
aVIt was recently dragged for plankton by scientists,
p219
aVand they found six times as much plastic as plankton.
p220
aVWhen asked, they said, "It's kind of like a giant toilet that doesn't flush."
p221
aVPerhaps that's away.
p222
aVSo we're looking for the design rules of this \u2014
p223
aVthis is the highest biodiversity of trees in the world, Irian Jaya,
p224
aV259 species of tree, and we described this
p225
aVin the book, "Cradle to Cradle."
p226
aVThe book itself is a polymer. It is not a tree.
p227
aVThat's the name of the first chapter \u2014 "This Book is Not a Tree."
p228
aVBecause in poetics, as Margaret Atwood pointed out,
p229
aV"we write our history on the skin of fish
p230
aVwith the blood of bears."
p231
aVAnd with so much polymer, what we really need
p232
aVis technical nutrition, and to use something
p233
aVas elegant as a tree \u2014 imagine this design assignment:
p234
aVDesign something that makes oxygen, sequesters carbon,
p235
aVfixes nitrogen, distills water, accrues solar energy as fuel,
p236
aVmakes complex sugars and food, creates microclimates,
p237
aVchanges colors with the seasons and self-replicates.
p238
aVWell, why don't we knock that down and write on it?
p239
aa(lp240
V(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VSo, we're looking at the same criteria
p243
aVas most people \u2014 you know, can I afford it?
p244
aVDoes it work? Do I like it?
p245
aVWe're adding the Jeffersonian agenda, and I come from Charlottesville,
p246
aVwhere I've had the privilege of living in a house designed by Thomas Jefferson.
p247
aVWe're adding life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
p248
aVNow if we look at the word "competition,"
p249
aVI'm sure most of you've used it.
p250
aVYou know, most people don't realize it comes from
p251
aVthe Latin competere, which means strive together.
p252
aVIt means the way Olympic athletes train with each other.
p253
aVThey get fit together, and then they compete.
p254
aVThe Williams sisters compete \u2014 one wins Wimbledon.
p255
aVSo we've been looking at the idea of competition
p256
aVas a way of cooperating in order to get fit together.
p257
aVAnd the Chinese government has now \u2014
p258
aVI work with the Chinese government now \u2014
p259
aVhas taken this up.
p260
aVWe're also looking at survival of the fittest,
p261
aVnot in just competition terms in our modern context
p262
aVof destroy the other or beat them to the ground,
p263
aVbut really to fit together and build niches
p264
aVand have growth that is good.
p265
aa(lp266
VNow most environmentalists don't say growth is good,
p267
aVbecause, in our lexicon, asphalt is two words: assigning blame.
p268
aVBut if we look at asphalt as our growth,
p269
aVthen we realize that all we're doing is destroying
p270
aVthe planetary's fundamental underlying operating system.
p271
aVSo when we see E equals mc squared come along, from a poet's perspective,
p272
aVwe see energy as physics, chemistry as mass,
p273
aVand all of a sudden, you get this biology.
p274
aVAnd we have plenty of energy, so we'll solve that problem,
p275
aVbut the biology problem's tricky, because as we put through
p276
aVall these toxic materials that we disgorge,
p277
aVwe will never be able to recover that.
p278
aVAnd as Francis Crick pointed out, nine years
p279
aVafter discovering DNA with Mr. Watson,
p280
aVthat life itself has to have growth as a precondition \u2014
p281
aVit has to have free energy, sunlight
p282
aVand it needs to be an open system of chemicals.
p283
aVSo we're asking for human artifice to become a living thing,
p284
aVand we want growth, we want free energy from sunlight
p285
aVand we want an open metabolism for chemicals.
p286
aVThen, the question becomes not growth or no growth,
p287
aVbut what do you want to grow?
p288
aVSo instead of just growing destruction,
p289
aVwe want to grow the things that we might enjoy,
p290
aVand someday the FDA will allow us to make French cheese.
p291
aa(lp292
VSo therefore, we have these two metabolisms,
p293
aVand I worked with a German chemist, Michael Braungart,
p294
aVand we've identified the two fundamental metabolisms.
p295
aVThe biological one I'm sure you understand,
p296
aVbut also the technical one, where we take materials
p297
aVand put them into closed cycles.
p298
aVWe call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition.
p299
aVTechnical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition.
p300
aVBiological nutrition can supply about 500 million humans,
p301
aVwhich means that if we all wore Birkenstocks and cotton,
p302
aVthe world would run out of cork and dry up.
p303
aVSo we need materials in closed cycles,
p304
aVbut we need to analyze them down to the parts per million
p305
aVfor cancer, birth defects, mutagenic effects,
p306
aVdisruption of our immune systems, biodegradation, persistence,
p307
aVheavy metal content, knowledge of how we're making them
p308
aVand their production and so on.
p309
aa(lp310
VOur first product was a textile where we analyzed 8,000 chemicals
p311
aVin the textile industry.
p312
aVUsing those intellectual filters, we eliminated [7,962.]
p313
aVWe were left with 38 chemicals.
p314
aVWe have since databased the 4000 most commonly used chemicals
p315
aVin human manufacturing, and we're releasing this database into the public in six weeks.
p316
aVSo designers all over the world can analyze their products
p317
aVdown to the parts per million for human and ecological health.
p318
aa(lp319
V(Applause)
p320
aa(lp321
VWe've developed a protocol so that companies can send
p322
aVthese same messages all the way through their supply chains,
p323
aVbecause when we asked most companies we work with \u2014 about a trillion dollars
p324
aV\u2014 and say, "Where does your stuff come from?" They say, "Suppliers."
p325
aV"And where does it go?"
p326
aV"Customers."
p327
aVSo we need some help there.
p328
aa(lp329
VSo the biological nutrients, the first fabrics \u2014
p330
aVthe water coming out was clean enough to drink.
p331
aVTechnical nutrients \u2014 this is for Shaw Carpet, infinitely reusable carpet.
p332
aVHere's nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet.
p333
aVBiotechnical nutrients \u2014 the Model U for Ford Motor,
p334
aVa cradle to cradle car \u2014 concept car.
p335
aVShoes for Nike, where the uppers are polyesters, infinitely recyclable,
p336
aVthe bottoms are biodegradable soles.
p337
aVWear your old shoes in, your new shoes out.
p338
aVThere is no finish line.
p339
aVThe idea here of the car is that some of the materials
p340
aVgo back to the industry forever, some of the materials go back to soil \u2014
p341
aVit's all solar-powered.
p342
aa(lp343
VHere's a building at Oberlin College we designed
p344
aVthat makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water.
p345
aVHere's a building for The Gap, where the ancient grasses
p346
aVof San Bruno, California, are on the roof.
p347
aa(lp348
VAnd this is our project for Ford Motor Company.
p349
aVIt's the revitalization of the River Rouge in Dearborn.
p350
aVThis is obviously a color photograph.
p351
aVThese are our tools. These are how we sold it to Ford.
p352
aVWe saved Ford 35 million dollars doing it this way, day one,
p353
aVwhich is the equivalent of the Ford Taurus
p354
aVat a four percent margin of an order for 900 million dollars worth of cars.
p355
aVHere it is. It's the world's largest green roof, 10 and a half acres.
p356
aVThis is the roof, saving money,
p357
aVand this is the first species to arrive here. These are killdeer.
p358
aVThey showed up in five days.
p359
aVAnd we now have 350-pound auto workers
p360
aVlearning bird songs on the Internet.
p361
aVWe're developing now protocols for cities \u2014
p362
aVthat's the home of technical nutrients.
p363
aVThe country \u2014 the home of biological. And putting them together.
p364
aa(lp365
VAnd so I will finish by showing you a new city
p366
aVwe're designing for the Chinese government.
p367
aVWe're doing 12 cities for China right now,
p368
aVbased on cradle to cradle as templates.
p369
aVOur assignment is to develop protocols for the housing
p370
aVfor 400 million people in 12 years.
p371
aVWe did a mass energy balance \u2014 if they use brick,
p372
aVthey will lose all their soil and burn all their coal.
p373
aVThey'll have cities with no energy and no food.
p374
aVWe signed a Memorandum of Understanding \u2014
p375
aVhere's Madam Deng Nan, Deng Xiaoping's daughter \u2014
p376
aVfor China to adopt cradle to cradle.
p377
aVBecause if they toxify themselves, being the lowest-cost producer,
p378
aVsend it to the lowest-cost distribution \u2014 Wal-Mart \u2014
p379
aVand then we send them all our money, what we'll discover is that
p380
aVwe have what, effectively, when I was a student,
p381
aVwas called mutually assured destruction.
p382
aa(lp383
VNow we do it by molecule. These are our cities.
p384
aVWe're building a new city next to this city; look at that landscape.
p385
aVThis is the site.
p386
aVWe don't normally do green fields, but this one is about to be built,
p387
aVso they brought us in to intercede.
p388
aVThis is their plan.
p389
aVIt's a rubber stamp grid that they laid right on that landscape.
p390
aVAnd they brought us in and said, "What would you do?"
p391
aVThis is what they would end up with, which is another color photograph.
p392
aVSo this is the existing site, so this is what it looks like now,
p393
aVand here's our proposal.
p394
aa(lp395
V(Applause)
p396
aa(lp397
VSo the way we approached this
p398
aVis we studied the hydrology very carefully.
p399
aVWe studied the biota, the ancient biota,
p400
aVthe current farming and the protocols.
p401
aVWe studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city
p402
aVwill have fresh air, fresh water and direct sunlight
p403
aVin every single apartment at some point during the day.
p404
aVWe then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure.
p405
aVWe lay out the building areas.

aVWe start to integrate commercial and mixed use
p407
aVso the people all have centers and places to be.
p408
aVThe transportation is all very simple,
p409
aVeverybody's within a five-minute walk of mobility.
p410
aVWe have a 24-hour street, so that there's always a place that's alive.
p411
aVThe waste systems all connect.
p412
aVIf you flush a toilet, your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants,
p413
aVwhich are sold as assets, not liabilities.
p414
aVBecause who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas?
p415
aVThe waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat restorations.
p416
aVAnd then it makes natural gas, which then goes back into the city
p417
aVto power the fuel for the cooking for the city.
p418
aVSo this is \u2014 these are fertilizer gas plants.
p419
aVAnd then the compost is all taken back
p420
aVto the roofs of the city, where we've got farming,
p421
aVbecause what we've done is lifted up the city,
p422
aVthe landscape, into the air to \u2014 to restore the native landscape
p423
aVon the roofs of the buildings.

p425
aVand all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city.
p426
aa(lp427
VAnd this is the concept for the top of the city.
p428
aVWe've lifted the earth up onto the roofs.
p429
aVThe farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next.
p430
aVWe inhabit the city with work/live space on all the ground floors.
p431
aVAnd so this is the existing city, and this is the new city.
