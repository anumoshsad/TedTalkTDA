VPeople say things about religion all the time.
p4
aV(Laughter)
p5
aVThe late, great Christopher Hitchens
p6
aVwrote a book called "God Is Not Great"
p7
aVwhose subtitle was, "Religion Poisons Everything."
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVBut last month, in Time magazine,
p10
aVRabbi David Wolpe, who I gather is referred to as America's rabbi,
p11
aVsaid, to balance that against that negative characterization,
p12
aVthat no important form of social change
p13
aVcan be brought about except through organized religion.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, remarks of this sort on the negative
p16
aVand the positive side are very old.
p17
aVI have one in my pocket here
p18
aVfrom the first century BCE by Lucretius,
p19
aVthe author of "On the Nature of Things," who said,
p20
aV"Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum" \u2014
p21
aVI should have been able to learn that by heart \u2014
p22
aVwhich is, that's how much religion
p23
aVis able to persuade people to do evil,
p24
aVand he was talking about the fact
p25
aVof Agamemnon's decision to place his daughter
p26
aVIphigenia on an altar of sacrifice
p27
aVin order to preserve the prospects of his army.
p28
aVSo there have been these long debates
p29
aVover the centuries, in that case, actually,
p30
aVwe can say over the millennia, about religion.
p31
aVPeople have talked about it a lot,
p32
aVand they've said good and bad
p33
aVand indifferent things about it.
p34
aa(lp35
VWhat I want to persuade you of today
p36
aVis of a very simple claim,
p37
aVwhich is that these debates are
p38
aVin a certain sense preposterous,
p39
aVbecause there is no such thing as religion
p40
aVabout which to make these claims.
p41
aVThere isn't a thing called religion,
p42
aVand so it can't be good or bad.
p43
aVIt can't even be indifferent.
p44
aVAnd if you think about claims
p45
aVabout the nonexistence of things,
p46
aVone obvious way to try and establish
p47
aVthe nonexistence of a purported thing
p48
aVwould be to offer a definition of that thing
p49
aVand then to see whether anything satisfied it.
p50
aVI'm going to start out on that little route
p51
aVto begin with.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo if you look in the dictionaries
p54
aVand if you think about it,
p55
aVone very natural definition of religion
p56
aVis that it involves belief in gods or in spiritual beings.
p57
aVAs I say, this is in many dictionaries,
p58
aVbut you'll also find it actually
p59
aVin the work of Sir Edward Tylor,
p60
aVwho was the first professor of anthropology at Oxford,
p61
aVone of the first modern anthropologists.
p62
aVIn his book on primitive culture,
p63
aVhe says the heart of religion is what he called animism,
p64
aVthat is, the belief in spiritual agency,
p65
aVbelief in spirits.
p66
aVThe first problem for that definition
p67
aVis from a recent novel by Paul Beatty called "Tuff."
p68
aVThere's a guy talking to a rabbi.
p69
aVThe rabbi says he doesn't believe in God.
p70
aVThe guy says, "You're a rabbi, how can you not believe in God?"
p71
aVAnd the reply is, "It's what's so great about being Jewish.
p72
aVYou don't have to believe in a God per se,
p73
aVjust in being Jewish." (Laughter)
p74
aVSo if this guy is a rabbi, and a Jewish rabbi,
p75
aVand if you have to believe in God in order to be religious,
p76
aVthen we have the rather counterintuitive conclusion
p77
aVthat since it's possible to be a Jewish rabbi
p78
aVwithout believing in God,
p79
aVJudaism isn't a religion.
p80
aVThat seems like a pretty counterintuitive thought.
p81
aa(lp82
VHere's another argument against this view.
p83
aVA friend of mine, an Indian friend of mine,
p84
aVwent to his grandfather when he was very young,
p85
aVa child, and said to him,
p86
aV"I want to talk to you about religion,"
p87
aVand his grandfather said, "You're too young.
p88
aVCome back when you're a teenager."
p89
aVSo he came back when he was a teenager,
p90
aVand he said to his grandfather,
p91
aV"It may be a bit late now
p92
aVbecause I've discovered that I don't believe in the gods."
p93
aVAnd his grandfather, who was a wise man, said,
p94
aV"Oh, so you belong to the atheist branch
p95
aVof the Hindu tradition." (Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VAnd finally, there's this guy,
p98
aVwho famously doesn't believe in God.
p99
aVHis name is the Dalai Lama.
p100
aVHe often jokes that he's one of the world's leading atheists.
p101
aVBut it's true, because the Dalai Lama's religion
p102
aVdoes not involve belief in God.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow you might think this just shows
p105
aVthat I've given you the wrong definition
p106
aVand that I should come up with some other definition
p107
aVand test it against these cases
p108
aVand try and find something that captures
p109
aVatheistic Judaism, atheistic Hinduism,
p110
aVand atheistic Buddhism as forms of religiosity,
p111
aVbut I actually think that that's a bad idea,
p112
aVand the reason I think it's a bad idea
p113
aVis that I don't think that's how
p114
aVour concept of religion works.
p115
aVI think the way our concept of religion works
p116
aVis that we actually have, we have a list
p117
aVof paradigm religions
p118
aVand their sub-parts, right,
p119
aVand if something new comes along
p120
aVthat purports to be a religion,
p121
aVwhat we ask is, "Well, is it like one of these?"
p122
aVRight?
p123
aVAnd I think that's not only how we think about religion,
p124
aVand that's, as it were,
p125
aVso from our point of view,
p126
aVanything on that list had better be a religion,
p127
aVwhich is why I don't think an account of religion
p128
aVthat excludes Buddhism and Judaism
p129
aVhas a chance of being a good starter,
p130
aVbecause they're on our list.
p131
aVBut why do we have such a list?
p132
aVWhat's going on? How did it come about
p133
aVthat we have this list?
p134
aa(lp135
VI think the answer is a pretty simple one
p136
aVand therefore crude and contentious.
p137
aVI'm sure a lot of people will disagree with it,
p138
aVbut here's my story,
p139
aVand true or not, it's a story that I think
p140
aVgives you a good sense of how
p141
aVthe list might have come about,
p142
aVand therefore helps you to think about
p143
aVwhat use the list might be.
p144
aVI think the answer is, European travelers,
p145
aVstarting roughly about the time of Columbus,
p146
aVstarted going around the world.
p147
aVThey came from a Christian culture,
p148
aVand when they arrived in a new place,
p149
aVthey noticed that some people didn't have Christianity,
p150
aVand so they asked themselves the following question:
p151
aVwhat have they got instead of Christianity?
p152
aVAnd that list was essentially constructed.
p153
aVIt consists of the things that other people had
p154
aVinstead of Christianity.
p155
aa(lp156
VNow there's a difficulty with proceeding in that way,
p157
aVwhich is that Christianity is extremely,
p158
aVeven on that list, it's an extremely specific tradition.
p159
aVIt has all kinds of things in it
p160
aVthat are very, very particular
p161
aVthat are the results of the specifics
p162
aVof Christian history,
p163
aVand one thing that's at the heart of it,
p164
aVone thing that's at the heart of most understandings of Christianity,
p165
aVwhich is the result of the specific history of Christianity,
p166
aVis that it's an extremely creedal religion.
p167
aVIt's a religion in which people are really concerned
p168
aVabout whether you believe the right things.
p169
aVThe history of Christianity, the internal history of Christianity,
p170
aVis largely the history of people killing each other
p171
aVbecause they believed the wrong thing,
p172
aVand it's also involved in
p173
aVstruggles with other religions,
p174
aVobviously starting in the Middle Ages,
p175
aVa struggle with Islam,
p176
aVin which, again, it was the infidelity,
p177
aVthe fact that they didn't believe the right things,
p178
aVthat seemed so offensive to the Christian world.
p179
aVNow that's a very specific and particular history
p180
aVthat Christianity has,
p181
aVand not everywhere is everything
p182
aVthat has ever been put on this sort of list like it.
p183
aVHere's another problem, I think.
p184
aVA very specific thing happened.
p185
aVIt was actually adverted to earlier,
p186
aVbut a very specific thing happened
p187
aVin the history of the kind of Christianity
p188
aVthat we see around us
p189
aVmostly in the United States today,
p190
aVand it happened in the late 19th century,
p191
aVand that specific thing that happened
p192
aVin the late 19th century
p193
aVwas a kind of deal that was cut
p194
aVbetween science,
p195
aVthis new way of organizing intellectual authority,
p196
aVand religion.
p197
aVIf you think about the 18th century, say,
p198
aVif you think about intellectual life
p199
aVbefore the late 19th century,
p200
aVanything you did, anything you thought about,
p201
aVwhether it was the physical world,
p202
aVthe human world,
p203
aVthe natural world apart from the human world,
p204
aVor morality, anything you did
p205
aVwould have been framed against the background
p206
aVof a set of assumptions that were religious,
p207
aVChristian assumptions.
p208
aVYou couldn't give an account
p209
aVof the natural world
p210
aVthat didn't say something about its relationship,
p211
aVfor example, to the creation story
p212
aVin the Abrahamic tradition,
p213
aVthe creation story in the first book of the Torah.
p214
aVSo everything was framed in that way.
p215
aa(lp216
VBut this changes in the late 19th century,
p217
aVand for the first time, it's possible for people
p218
aVto develop serious intellectual careers
p219
aVas natural historians like Darwin.
p220
aVDarwin worried about the relationship between
p221
aVwhat he said and the truths of religion,
p222
aVbut he could proceed, he could write books
p223
aVabout his subject
p224
aVwithout having to say what the relationship was
p225
aVto the religious claims,
p226
aVand similarly, geologists increasingly could talk about it.
p227
aVIn the early 19th century, if you were a geologist
p228
aVand made a claim about the age of the Earth,
p229
aVyou had to explain whether that was consistent
p230
aVor how it was or wasn't consistent
p231
aVwith the age of the Earth implied
p232
aVby the account in Genesis.
p233
aVBy the end of the 19th century,
p234
aVyou can just write a geology textbook
p235
aVin which you make arguments about how old the Earth is.
p236
aVSo there's a big change, and that division,
p237
aVthat intellectual division of labor occurs as I say, I think,
p238
aVand it sort of solidifies so that by the end
p239
aVof the 19th century in Europe,
p240
aVthere's a real intellectual division of labor,
p241
aVand you can do all sorts of serious things,
p242
aVincluding, increasingly, even philosophy,
p243
aVwithout being constrained by the thought,
p244
aV"Well, what I have to say has to be consistent
p245
aVwith the deep truths that are given to me
p246
aVby our religious tradition."
p247
aa(lp248
VSo imagine someone who's coming out
p249
aVof that world, that late-19th-century world,
p250
aVcoming into the country that I grew up in, Ghana,
p251
aVthe society that I grew up in, Asante,
p252
aVcoming into that world
p253
aVat the turn of the 20th century
p254
aVwith this question that made the list:
p255
aVwhat have they got instead of Christianity?
p256
aa(lp257
VWell, here's one thing he would have noticed,
p258
aVand by the way, there was a  person who actually did this.
p259
aVHis name was Captain Rattray,
p260
aVhe was sent as the British government anthropologist,
p261
aVand he wrote a book about Asante religion.
p262
aa(lp263
VThis is a soul disc.
p264
aVThere are many of them in the British Museum.
p265
aVI could give you an interesting, different history
p266
aVof how it comes about that many of the things
p267
aVfrom my society ended up in the British Museum,
p268
aVbut we don't have time for that.
p269
aVSo this object is a soul disc.
p270
aVWhat is a soul disc?
p271
aVIt was worn around the necks
p272
aVof the soul-washers of the Asante king.
p273
aVWhat was their job? To wash the king's soul.
p274
aVIt would take a long while
p275
aVto explain how a soul could be the kind of thing
p276
aVthat could be washed,
p277
aVbut Rattray knew that this was religion
p278
aVbecause souls were in play.
p279
aa(lp280
VAnd similarly,
p281
aVthere were many other things, many other practices.
p282
aVFor example, every time anybody had a drink, more or less,
p283
aVthey poured a little bit on the ground
p284
aVin what's called the libation,
p285
aVand they gave some to the ancestors.
p286
aVMy father did this. Every time he opened a bottle of whiskey,
p287
aVwhich I'm glad to say was very often,
p288
aVhe would take the top off and pour off just a little on the ground,
p289
aVand he would talk to,
p290
aVhe would say to Akroma-Ampim, the founder of our line,
p291
aVor Yao Antony, my great uncle,
p292
aVhe would talk to them,
p293
aVoffer them a little bit of this.
p294
aa(lp295
VAnd finally, there were these huge public ceremonials.
p296
aVThis is an early-19th-century drawing
p297
aVby another British military officer
p298
aVof such a ceremonial,
p299
aVwhere the king was involved,
p300
aVand the king's job,
p301
aVone of the large parts of his job,
p302
aVapart from organizing warfare and things like that,
p303
aVwas to look after the tombs of his ancestors,
p304
aVand when a king died,
p305
aVthe stool that he sat on was blackened
p306
aVand put in the royal ancestral temple,
p307
aVand every 40 days,
p308
aVthe King of Asante has to go and do cult
p309
aVfor his ancestors.
p310
aVThat's a large part of his job,
p311
aVand people think that if he doesn't do it,
p312
aVthings will fall apart.
p313
aVSo he's a religious figure,
p314
aVas Rattray would have said,
p315
aVas well as a political figure.
p316
aa(lp317
VSo all this would count as religion for Rattray,
p318
aVbut my point is that when you look
p319
aVinto the lives of those people,
p320
aVyou also find that every time they do anything,
p321
aVthey're conscious of the ancestors.
p322
aVEvery morning at breakfast,
p323
aVyou can go outside the front of the house
p324
aVand make an offering to the god tree, the nyame dua
p325
aVoutside your house,
p326
aVand again, you'll talk to the gods
p327
aVand the high gods and the low gods
p328
aVand the ancestors and so on.
p329
aVThis is not a world
p330
aVin which the separation between religion and science
p331
aVhas occurred.
p332
aVReligion has not being separated
p333
aVfrom any other areas of life,
p334
aVand in particular,
p335
aVwhat's crucial to understand about this world
p336
aVis that it's a world in which the job
p337
aVthat science does for us
p338
aVis done by what Rattray is going to call religion,
p339
aVbecause if they want an explanation of something,
p340
aVif they want to know why the crop just failed,
p341
aVif they want to know why it's raining
p342
aVor not raining, if they need rain,
p343
aVif they want to know why
p344
aVtheir grandfather has died,
p345
aVthey are going to appeal to the very same entities,
p346
aVthe very same language,
p347
aVtalk to the very same gods about that.
p348
aVThis great separation, in other words,
p349
aVbetween religion and science hasn't happened.
p350
aa(lp351
VNow, this would be a mere historical curiosity,
p352
aVexcept that in large parts of the world,
p353
aVthis is still the truth.
p354
aVI had the privilege of going to a wedding
p355
aVthe other day in northern Namibia,
p356
aV20 miles or so south of the Angolan border
p357
aVin a village of 200 people.
p358
aVThese were modern people.
p359
aVWe had with us Oona Chaplin,
p360
aVwho some of you may have heard of,
p361
aVand one of the people from this village came up to her,
p362
aVand said, "I've seen you in 'Game of Thrones.'"
p363
aVSo these were not people who were isolated from our world,
p364
aVbut nevertheless, for them,
p365
aVthe gods and the spirits are still very much there,
p366
aVand when we were on the bus going back and forth
p367
aVto the various parts of the [ceremony],
p368
aVthey prayed not just in a generic way
p369
aVbut for the safety of the journey,
p370
aVand they meant it,
p371
aVand when they said to me that my mother,
p372
aVthe bridegroom's [grandmother],
p373
aVwas with us, they didn't mean it figuratively.
p374
aVThey meant, even though she was a dead person,
p375
aVthey meant that she was still around.
p376
aVSo in large parts of the world today,
p377
aVthat separation between science and religion
p378
aVhasn't occurred in large parts of the world today,
p379
aVand as I say, these are not \u2014
p380
aVThis guy used to work for Chase and at the World Bank.
p381
aVThese are fellow citizens of the world with you,
p382
aVbut they come from a place in which religion
p383
aVis occupying a very different role.
p384
aa(lp385
VSo what I want you to think about next time somebody wants
p386
aVto make some vast generalization about religion
p387
aVis that maybe there isn't such a thing
p388
aVas a religion, such a thing as religion,
p389
aVand that therefore what they say
p390
aVcannot possibly be true.
