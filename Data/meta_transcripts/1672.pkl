VThere's a group of people in Kenya.
p4
aVPeople cross oceans to go see them.
p5
aVThese people are tall.
p6
aVThey jump high. They wear red.
p7
aVAnd they kill lions.
p8
aVYou might be wondering, who are these people?
p9
aVThese are the Maasais.
p10
aVAnd you know what's cool? I'm actually one of them.
p11
aa(lp12
VThe Maasais, the boys are brought up to be warriors.
p13
aVThe girls are brought up to be mothers.
p14
aVWhen I was five years old,
p15
aVI found out that I was engaged
p16
aVto be married as soon as I reached puberty.
p17
aVMy mother, my grandmother, my aunties,
p18
aVthey constantly reminded me that
p19
aVyour husband just passed by.
p20
aV(Laughter) Cool, yeah?
p21
aVAnd everything I had to do from that moment
p22
aVwas to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age 12.
p23
aVMy day started at 5 in the morning,
p24
aVmilking the cows, sweeping the house,
p25
aVcooking for my siblings, collecting water, firewood.
p26
aVI did everything that I needed to do
p27
aVto become a perfect wife.
p28
aa(lp29
VI went to school not because the Maasais'
p30
aVwomen or girls were going to school.
p31
aVIt's because my mother was denied an education,
p32
aVand she constantly reminded me and my siblings that
p33
aVshe never wanted us to live the life she was living.
p34
aVWhy did she say that?
p35
aVMy father worked as a policeman in the city.
p36
aVHe came home once a year.
p37
aVWe didn't see him for sometimes even two years.
p38
aVAnd whenever he came home, it was a different case.
p39
aVMy mother worked hard in the farm
p40
aVto grow crops so that we can eat.
p41
aVShe reared the cows and the goats
p42
aVso that she can care for us.
p43
aVBut when my father came, he would sell the cows,
p44
aVhe would sell the products we had,
p45
aVand he went and drank with his friends in the bars.
p46
aVBecause my mother was a woman,
p47
aVshe was not allowed to own any property,
p48
aVand by default, everything in my family anyway
p49
aVbelongs to my father, so he had the right.
p50
aVAnd if my mother ever questioned him,
p51
aVhe beat her, abused her, and really it was difficult.
p52
aa(lp53
VWhen I went to school, I had a dream.
p54
aVI wanted to become a teacher.
p55
aVTeachers looked nice.
p56
aVThey wear nice dresses, high-heeled shoes.
p57
aVI found out later that they are uncomfortable, but I admired it.
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aVBut most of all, the teacher was just writing on the board \u2014
p60
aVnot hard work, that's what I thought,
p61
aVcompared to what I was doing in the farm.
p62
aVSo I wanted to become a teacher.
p63
aa(lp64
VI worked hard in school, but when I was in eighth grade,
p65
aVit was a determining factor.
p66
aVIn our tradition, there is a ceremony
p67
aVthat girls have to undergo to become women,
p68
aVand it's a rite of passage to womanhood.
p69
aVAnd then I was just finishing my eighth grade,
p70
aVand that was a transition for me to go to high school.
p71
aVThis was the crossroad.
p72
aVOnce I go through this tradition, I was going to become a wife.
p73
aVWell, my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass.
p74
aVSo I talked \u2014 I had to come up with a plan
p75
aVto figure these things out.
p76
aVI talked to my father. I did something that most girls have never done.
p77
aVI told my father, "I will only go through this ceremony
p78
aVif you let me go back to school."
p79
aVThe reason why, if I ran away,
p80
aVmy father will have a stigma, people will be calling him
p81
aVthe father of that girl who didn't go through the ceremony.
p82
aVIt was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life.
p83
aVSo he figured out. "Well," he said, "okay,
p84
aVyou'll go to school after the ceremony."
p85
aa(lp86
VI did. The ceremony happened.
p87
aVIt's a whole week long of excitement.
p88
aVIt's a ceremony. People are enjoying it.
p89
aVAnd the day before the actual ceremony happens,
p90
aVwe were dancing, having excitement,
p91
aVand through all the night we did not sleep.
p92
aVThe actual day came, and we walked out of the house
p93
aVthat we were dancing in. Yes, we danced and danced.
p94
aVWe walked out to the courtyard, and there were a bunch of people waiting.
p95
aVThey were all in a circle.
p96
aVAnd as we danced and danced,
p97
aVand we approached this circle of women,
p98
aVmen, women, children, everybody was there.
p99
aVThere was a woman sitting in the middle of it,
p100
aVand this woman was waiting to hold us.
p101
aVI was the first. There were my sisters and a couple of other girls,
p102
aVand as I approached her,
p103
aVshe looked at me, and I sat down.
p104
aVAnd I sat down, and I opened my legs.
p105
aVAs I opened my leg, another woman came,
p106
aVand this woman was carrying a knife.
p107
aVAnd as she carried the knife, she walked toward me
p108
aVand she held the clitoris, and she cut it off.
p109
aa(lp110
VAs you can imagine, I bled. I bled.
p111
aVAfter bleeding for a while, I fainted thereafter.
p112
aVIt's something that so many girls \u2014
p113
aVI'm lucky, I never died \u2014 but many die.
p114
aVIt's practiced, it's no anesthesia, it's a rusty old knife,
p115
aVand it was difficult.
p116
aVI was lucky because one, also, my mom did something
p117
aVthat most women don't do.
p118
aVThree days later, after everybody has left the home,
p119
aVmy mom went and brought a nurse.
p120
aVWe were taken care of.
p121
aVThree weeks later, I was healed, and I was back in high school.
p122
aVI was so determined to be a teacher now
p123
aVso that I could make a difference in my family.
p124
aa(lp125
VWell, while I was in high school, something happened.
p126
aVI met a young gentleman from our village
p127
aVwho had been to the University of Oregon.
p128
aVThis man was wearing a white t-shirt, jeans, camera,
p129
aVwhite sneakers \u2014 and I'm talking about white sneakers.
p130
aVThere is something about clothes, I think, and shoes.
p131
aVThey were sneakers, and this is in a village
p132
aVthat doesn't even have paved roads. It was quite attractive.
p133
aa(lp134
VI told him, "Well, I want to go to where you are,"
p135
aVbecause this man looked very happy, and I admired that.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd he told me, "Well,
p138
aVwhat do you mean, you want to go?
p139
aVDon't you have a husband waiting for you?"
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd I told him, "Don't worry about that part.
p142
aVJust tell me how to get there."
p143
aa(lp144
VThis gentleman, he helped me.
p145
aVWhile I was in high school also, my dad was sick.
p146
aVHe got a stroke, and he was really, really sick,
p147
aVso he really couldn't tell me what to do next.
p148
aVBut the problem is, my father is not the only father I have.
p149
aVEverybody who is my dad's age, male in the community,
p150
aVis my father by default \u2014
p151
aVmy uncles, all of them \u2014 and they dictate what my future is.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo the news came, I applied to school
p154
aVand I was accepted to Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia,
p155
aVand I couldn't come without the support of the village,
p156
aVbecause I needed to raise money to buy the air ticket.
p157
aVI got a scholarship but I needed to get myself here.
p158
aVBut I needed the support of the village,
p159
aVand here again, when the men heard,
p160
aVand the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school,
p161
aVthey said, "What a lost opportunity.
p162
aVThis should have been given to a boy. We can't do this."
p163
aa(lp164
VSo I went back and I had to go back to the tradition.
p165
aVThere's a belief among our people
p166
aVthat morning brings good news.
p167
aVSo I had to come up with something to do with the morning,
p168
aVbecause there's good news in the morning.
p169
aVAnd in the village also, there is one chief, an elder,
p170
aVwho if he says yes, everybody will follow him.
p171
aVSo I went to him very early in the morning, as the sun rose.
p172
aVThe first thing he sees when he opens his door is, it's me.
p173
aa(lp174
V"My child, what are you doing here?"
p175
aa(lp176
V"Well, Dad, I need help. Can you support me to go to America?"
p177
aVI promised him that I would be the best girl,
p178
aVI will come back, anything they wanted after that,
p179
aVI will do it for them.
p180
aa(lp181
VHe said, "Well, but I can't do it alone."
p182
aVHe gave me a list of another 15 men that I went \u2014
p183
aV16 more men \u2014 every single morning
p184
aVI went and visited them.
p185
aVThey all came together.
p186
aVThe village, the women, the men, everybody came together
p187
aVto support me to come to get an education.
p188
aa(lp189
VI arrived in America. As you can imagine, what did I find?
p190
aVI found snow!
p191
aVI found Wal-Marts, vacuum cleaners,
p192
aVand lots of food in the cafeteria.
p193
aVI was in a land of plenty.
p194
aa(lp195
VI enjoyed myself, but during that moment while I was here,
p196
aVI discovered a lot of things.
p197
aVI learned that that ceremony that I went through
p198
aVwhen I was 13 years old, it was called female genital mutilation.
p199
aVI learned that it was against the law in Kenya.
p200
aVI learned that I did not have to trade part of my body
p201
aVto get an education. I had a right.
p202
aVAnd as we speak right now, three million girls
p203
aVin Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation.
p204
aVI learned that my mom had a right to own property.
p205
aVI learned that she did not have to be abused
p206
aVbecause she is a woman.
p207
aVThose things made me angry.
p208
aVI wanted to do something.
p209
aVAs I went back, every time I went,
p210
aVI found that my neighbors' girls were getting married.
p211
aVThey were getting mutilated, and here,
p212
aVafter I graduated from here, I worked at the U.N.,
p213
aVI went back to school to get my graduate work,
p214
aVthe constant cry of these girls was in my face.
p215
aVI had to do something.
p216
aa(lp217
VAs I went back, I started talking to the men,
p218
aVto the village, and mothers, and I said,
p219
aV"I want to give back the way I had promised you
p220
aVthat I would come back and help you. What do you need?"
p221
aa(lp222
VAs I spoke to the women, they told me,
p223
aV"You know what we need? We really need a school for girls."
p224
aVBecause there had not been any school for girls.
p225
aVAnd the reason they wanted the school for girls
p226
aVis because when a girl is raped when she's walking to school,
p227
aVthe mother is blamed for that.
p228
aVIf she got pregnant before she got married,
p229
aVthe mother is blamed for that, and she's punished.
p230
aVShe's beaten.
p231
aVThey said, "We wanted to put our girls in a safe place."
p232
aa(lp233
VAs we moved, and I went to talk to the fathers,
p234
aVthe fathers, of course, you can imagine what they said:
p235
aV"We want a school for boys."
p236
aa(lp237
VAnd I said, "Well, there are a couple of men from my village
p238
aVwho have been out and they have gotten an education.
p239
aVWhy can't they build a school for boys,
p240
aVand I'll build a school for girls?"
p241
aVThat made sense. And they agreed.
p242
aVAnd I told them, I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment.
p243
aVAnd they did. They donated land where we built the girls' school.
p244
aVWe have.
p245
aa(lp246
VI want you to meet one of the girls in that school.
p247
aVAngeline came to apply for the school,
p248
aVand she did not meet any criteria that we had.
p249
aVShe's an orphan. Yes, we could have taken her for that.
p250
aVBut she was older. She was 12 years old,
p251
aVand we were taking girls who were in fourth grade.
p252
aVAngeline had been moving from one place \u2014
p253
aVbecause she's an orphan, she has no mother, she has no father \u2014
p254
aVmoving from one grandmother's house to another one,
p255
aVfrom aunties to aunties. She had no stability in her life.
p256
aVAnd I looked at her, I remember that day,
p257
aVand I saw something beyond what I was seeing in Angeline.
p258
aVAnd yes, she was older to be in fourth grade.
p259
aVWe gave her the opportunity to come to the class.
p260
aVFive months later, that is Angeline.
p261
aVA transformation had begun in her life.
p262
aVAngeline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world
p263
aVand make a difference.
p264
aVShe was not the top student when we took her.
p265
aVNow she's the best student, not just in our school,
p266
aVbut in the entire division that we are in.
p267
aVThat's Sharon. That's five years later.
p268
aVThat's Evelyn. Five months later, that is the difference that we are making.
p269
aa(lp270
VAs a new dawn is happening in my school,
p271
aVa new beginning is happening.
p272
aVAs we speak right now, 125 girls will never be mutilated.
p273
aVOne hundred twenty-five girls will not be married when they're 12 years old.
p274
aVOne hundred twenty-five girls are creating and achieving their dreams.
p275
aVThis is the thing that we are doing,
p276
aVgiving them opportunities where they can rise.
p277
aVAs we speak right now, women are not being beaten
p278
aVbecause of the revolutions we've started in our community.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Applause)
p281
aa(lp282
VI want to challenge you today.
p283
aVYou are listening to me because you are here,
p284
aVvery optimistic.
p285
aVYou are somebody who is so passionate.
p286
aVYou are somebody who wants to see a better world.
p287
aVYou are somebody who wants to see that war ends, no poverty.
p288
aVYou are somebody who wants to make a difference.
p289
aVYou are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better.
p290
aVI want to challenge you today that to be the first,
p291
aVbecause people will follow you.
p292
aVBe the first. People will follow you.
p293
aVBe bold. Stand up. Be fearless. Be confident.
p294
aVMove out, because as you change your world,
p295
aVas you change your community,
p296
aVas we believe that we are impacting one girl, one family,
p297
aVone village, one country at a time.
p298
aVWe are making a difference, so if you change your world,
p299
aVyou are going to change your community,
p300
aVyou are going to change your country,
p301
aVand think about that. If you do that, and I do that,
p302
aVaren't we going to create a better future for our children,
p303
aVfor your children, for our grandchildren?
p304
aVAnd we will live in a very peaceful world. Thank you very much.
