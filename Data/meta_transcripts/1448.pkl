VSo it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language.
p4
aVIt has generated considerable insight in physics,
p5
aVin biology and economics,
p6
aVbut not that much in the humanities and in history.
p7
aVI think there's a belief that it's just impossible,
p8
aVthat you cannot quantify the doings of mankind,
p9
aVthat you cannot measure history.
p10
aVBut I don't think that's right.
p11
aVI want to show you a couple of examples why.
p12
aa(lp13
VSo my collaborator Erez and I were considering the following fact:
p14
aVthat two kings separated by centuries
p15
aVwill speak a very different language.
p16
aVThat's a powerful historical force.
p17
aVSo the king of England, Alfred the Great,
p18
aVwill use a vocabulary and grammar
p19
aVthat is quite different from the king of hip hop, Jay-Z.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVNow it's just the way it is.
p22
aVLanguage changes over time, and it's a powerful force.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo Erez and I wanted to know more about that.
p25
aVSo we paid attention to a particular grammatical rule, past-tense conjugation.
p26
aVSo you just add "ed" to a verb at the end to signify the past.
p27
aV"Today I walk. Yesterday I walked."
p28
aVBut some verbs are irregular.
p29
aV"Yesterday I thought."
p30
aVNow what's interesting about that
p31
aVis irregular verbs between Alfred and Jay-Z have become more regular.
p32
aVLike the verb "to wed" that you see here has become regular.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo Erez and I followed the fate of over 100 irregular verbs
p35
aVthrough 12 centuries of English language,
p36
aVand we saw that there's actually a very simple mathematical pattern
p37
aVthat captures this complex historical change,
p38
aVnamely, if a verb is 100 times more frequent than another,
p39
aVit regularizes 10 times slower.
p40
aVThat's a piece of history, but it comes in a mathematical wrapping.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow in some cases math can even help explain,
p43
aVor propose explanations for, historical forces.
p44
aVSo here Steve Pinker and I
p45
aVwere considering the magnitude of wars during the last two centuries.
p46
aVThere's actually a well-known regularity to them
p47
aVwhere the number of wars that are 100 times deadlier
p48
aVis 10 times smaller.
p49
aVSo there are 30 wars that are about as deadly as the Six Days War,
p50
aVbut there's only four wars that are 100 times deadlier \u2014
p51
aVlike World War I.
p52
aVSo what kind of historical mechanism can produce that?
p53
aVWhat's the origin of this?
p54
aa(lp55
VSo Steve and I, through mathematical analysis,
p56
aVpropose that there's actually a very simple phenomenon at the root of this,
p57
aVwhich lies in our brains.
p58
aVThis is a very well-known feature
p59
aVin which we perceive quantities in relative ways \u2014
p60
aVquantities like the intensity of light or the loudness of a sound.
p61
aVFor instance, committing 10,000 soldiers to the next battle sounds like a lot.
p62
aVIt's relatively enormous if you've already committed 1,000 soldiers previously.
p63
aVBut it doesn't sound so much,
p64
aVit's not relatively enough, it won't make a difference
p65
aVif you've already committed 100,000 soldiers previously.
p66
aVSo you see that because of the way we perceive quantities,
p67
aVas the war drags on,
p68
aVthe number of soldiers committed to it and the casualties
p69
aVwill increase not linearly \u2014
p70
aVlike 10,000, 11,000, 12,000 \u2014
p71
aVbut exponentially \u2014 10,000, later 20,000, later 40,000.
p72
aVAnd so that explains this pattern that we've seen before.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo here mathematics is able to link a well-known feature of the individual mind
p75
aVwith a long-term historical pattern
p76
aVthat unfolds over centuries and across continents.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo these types of examples, today there are just a few of them,
p79
aVbut I think in the next decade they will become commonplace.
p80
aVThe reason for that is that the historical record
p81
aVis becoming digitized at a very fast pace.
p82
aVSo there's about 130 million books
p83
aVthat have been written since the dawn of time.
p84
aVCompanies like Google have digitized many of them \u2014
p85
aVabove 20 million actually.
p86
aVAnd when the stuff of history is available in digital form,
p87
aVit makes it possible for a mathematical analysis
p88
aVto very quickly and very conveniently
p89
aVreview trends in our history and our culture.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo I think in the next decade,
p92
aVthe sciences and the humanities will come closer together
p93
aVto be able to answer deep questions about mankind.
p94
aVAnd I think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that.
p95
aVIt will be able to reveal new trends in our history,
p96
aVsometimes to explain them,
p97
aVand maybe even in the future to predict what's going to happen.
