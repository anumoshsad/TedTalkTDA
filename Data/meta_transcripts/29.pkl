VYou'll be happy to know that I'll be talking not about my own tragedy,
p4
aVbut other people's tragedy.
p5
aVIt's a lot easier to be lighthearted about other people's tragedy
p6
aVthan your own,
p7
aVand I want to keep it in the spirit of the conference.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo, if you believe the media accounts,
p10
aVbeing a drug dealer in the height of the crack cocaine epidemic
p11
aVwas a very glamorous life, in the words of Virginia Postrel.
p12
aVThere was money, there was drugs, guns, women,
p13
aVyou know, you name it \u2014 jewelry, bling-bling \u2014 it had it all.
p14
aa(lp15
VWhat I'm going to tell you today is that, in fact, based on 10 years of research,
p16
aVa unique opportunity to go inside a gang \u2014
p17
aVto see the actual books, the financial records of the gang \u2014
p18
aVthat the answer turns out not to be
p19
aVthat being in the gang was a glamorous life.
p20
aVBut I think, more realistically, that being in a gang \u2014
p21
aVselling drugs for a gang \u2014 is perhaps the worst job in all of America.
p22
aVAnd that's what I'd like to convince you of today.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo there are three things I want to do.
p25
aVFirst, I want to explain how and why crack cocaine
p26
aVhad such a profound influence on inner-city gangs.
p27
aVSecondly, I want to tell you
p28
aVhow somebody like me came to be able to see
p29
aVthe inner workings of a gang \u2014 an interesting story, I think.
p30
aVAnd then third, I want to tell you, in a very superficial way,
p31
aVabout some of the things we found
p32
aVwhen we actually got to look at the financial records,
p33
aVthe books, of the gang.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo before I do that, just one warning,
p36
aVwhich is that this presentation has been rated 'R'
p37
aVby the Motion Picture Association of America.
p38
aVIt contains adult themes, adult language.
p39
aVGiven who is up on the stage, you'll be delighted to know
p40
aVthat, in fact, there'll be no nudity \u2014
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VUnexpected wardrobe malfunctions aside.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VSo let me start by talking about crack cocaine,
p49
aVand how it transformed the gang.
p50
aVTo do that, you have to actually go back to a time before crack cocaine,
p51
aVin the early '80s, and look at it from the perspective of a gang leader.
p52
aVBeing a gang leader in the inner city wasn't such a bad deal in the mid-'80s \u2014
p53
aVthe early '80s, let me say.
p54
aa(lp55
VNow, you had a lot of power, and you got to beat people up \u2014
p56
aVyou got a lot of prestige, a lot of respect.
p57
aVBut the thing is, there was no money in it.
p58
aVThe gang had no way to make money.
p59
aVYou couldn't charge dues to the people in the gang,
p60
aVbecause the people in the gang didn't have any money.
p61
aVYou couldn't really make any money selling marijuana \u2014
p62
aVmarijuana's too cheap, it turns out.
p63
aVYou can't get rich selling marijuana.
p64
aVYou couldn't sell cocaine;
p65
aVcocaine's a great product \u2014 powdered cocaine \u2014
p66
aVbut you've got to know rich white people.
p67
aVAnd most of the inner-city gang members didn't know any rich white people,
p68
aVso couldn't sell to that market.
p69
aVYou couldn't really do petty crime, either.
p70
aVTurns out, petty crime's a terrible way to make a living.
p71
aa(lp72
VAs a result, as a gang leader, you had, you know, power \u2014
p73
aVit's a pretty good life \u2014 but the thing was, in the end,
p74
aVyou were living at home with your mother.
p75
aVAnd so it wasn't really a career.
p76
aVThere were limits to how powerful and important you could be
p77
aVif you had to live at home with your mother.
p78
aa(lp79
VThen along comes crack cocaine.
p80
aVAnd in the words of Malcolm Gladwell,
p81
aVcrack cocaine was the extra-chunky version of tomato sauce
p82
aVfor the inner city.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VBecause crack cocaine was an unbelievable innovation.
p87
aVI don't have time to talk about it today, but if you think about it,
p88
aVI would say that in the last 25 years,
p89
aVof every invention or innovation that's occurred in this country,
p90
aVthe biggest one in terms of impact
p91
aVon the well-being of people who live in the inner city,
p92
aVwas crack cocaine.
p93
aVAnd for the worse \u2014 not for the better, but for the worse.
p94
aVIt had a huge impact on life.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo what was it about crack cocaine?
p97
aVIt was a brilliant way of getting the brain high.
p98
aVBecause you could smoke crack cocaine \u2014 you can't smoke powdered cocaine \u2014
p99
aVand smoking is a much more efficient mechanism of delivering a high
p100
aVthan snorting it.
p101
aVAnd it turned out there was this audience that didn't know it wanted crack cocaine,
p102
aVbut when it came, it really did.
p103
aVAnd it was a perfect drug;
p104
aVyou could buy the cocaine that went into it for a dollar,
p105
aVsell it for five dollars.
p106
aVHighly addictive \u2014 the high was very short.
p107
aVSo for fifteen minutes, you get this great high,
p108
aVand then when you come down,
p109
aVall you want to do is get high again.
p110
aa(lp111
VIt created a wonderful market.
p112
aVAnd for the people who were there running the gang,
p113
aVit was a great way, seemingly, to make a lot of money.
p114
aVAt least for the people on the top.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo this is where we enter the picture.
p117
aVNot really me \u2014 I'm really a bit player in all this.
p118
aVMy co-author, Sudhir Venkatesh, is the main character.
p119
aVHe was a math major in college who had a good heart,
p120
aVand decided he wanted to get a sociology PhD,
p121
aVcame to the University of Chicago.
p122
aVNow, the three months before he came to Chicago,
p123
aVhe had spent following the Grateful Dead.
p124
aVAnd in his own words, he "looked like a freak."
p125
aVHe's a South Asian \u2014 very dark-skinned South Asian.
p126
aVBig man, and he had hair, in his words, "down to his ass."
p127
aVDefied all kinds of boundaries:
p128
aVWas he black or white? Was he man or woman?
p129
aVHe was really a curious sight to be seen.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo he showed up at the University of Chicago,
p132
aVand the famous sociologist William Julius Wilson
p133
aVwas doing a book that involved surveying people all across Chicago.
p134
aVHe took one look at Sudhir, who was going to go do some surveys for him,
p135
aVand decided he knew exactly the place to send him,
p136
aVwhich was to one of the toughest, most notorious housing projects
p137
aVnot just in Chicago, but in the entire United States.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo Sudhir, the suburban boy who had never really been in the inner city,
p140
aVdutifully took his clipboard and walked down to this housing project,
p141
aVgets to the first building.
p142
aVThe first building? Well, there's nobody there.
p143
aVBut he hears some voices up in the stairwell,
p144
aVso he climbs up the stairwell, comes around the corner,
p145
aVand finds a group of young African-American men playing dice.
p146
aa(lp147
VThis is about 1990, peak of the crack epidemic.
p148
aVThis is a very dangerous job, being in a gang.
p149
aVYou don't like to be surprised.
p150
aVYou don't like to be surprised by people who come around the corner.
p151
aVAnd the mantra was: shoot first; ask questions later.
p152
aVNow, Sudhir was lucky \u2014 he was such a freak,
p153
aVand that clipboard probably saved his life,
p154
aVbecause they figured no other rival gang member
p155
aVwould be coming up to shoot at them with a clipboard.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VSo his greeting was not particularly warm, but they did say,
p160
aVwell, OK \u2014 let's hear your questions on your survey.
p161
aVSo \u2014 I kid you not \u2014
p162
aVthe first question on the survey that he was sent to ask was:
p163
aV"How do you feel about being poor and Black in America?"
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VMakes you wonder about academics.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VSo the choice of answers were:
p172
aa(lp173
V[A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad D) Very Bad]
p174
aa(lp175
V(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VWhat Sudhir found out is, in fact, that the real answer was the following:
p178
aV[A) Very Good B) Good C) Bad D) Very Bad E) Fuck you]
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VThe survey was not, in the end, going to be what got Sudhir off the hook.
p183
aVHe was held hostage overnight in the stairwell.
p184
aVThere was a lot of gunfire,
p185
aVthere were a lot of philosophical discussions he had with the gang members.
p186
aVBy morning, the gang leader arrived,
p187
aVchecked out Sudhir, decided he was no threat,
p188
aVand they let him go home.
p189
aVSo Sudhir went home, took a shower, took a nap.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd you and I, probably, faced with the situation, would think,
p192
aV"I guess I'm going to write my dissertation on The Grateful Dead,
p193
aVI've been following them for the last three months."
p194
aa(lp195
V(Laughter)
p196
aa(lp197
VSudhir, on the other hand,
p198
aVgot right back, walked down to the housing project,
p199
aVwent up to the second floor,
p200
aVand said: "Hey, guys, I had so much fun hanging out with you last night,
p201
aVI wonder if I could do it again tonight."
p202
aVAnd that was the beginning of what turned out to be a beautiful relationship
p203
aVthat involved Sudhir living in the housing project on and off for 10 years,
p204
aVhanging out in crack houses, going to jail with the gang members,
p205
aVhaving the windows shot out of his car,
p206
aVhaving the police break into his apartment and steal his computer disks \u2014
p207
aVyou name it.
p208
aVBut ultimately, the story has a happy ending for Sudhir,
p209
aVwho became one of the most respected sociologists in the country.
p210
aVAnd especially for me,
p211
aVas I sat in my office with my Excel spreadsheet open,
p212
aVwaiting for Sudhir to come and deliver to me the latest load of data
p213
aVthat he would get from the gang.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VIt was one of the most unequal co-authoring relationships ever \u2014
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VBut I was glad to be the beneficiary of it.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo what did we find?
p224
aVWhat did we find in the gang?
p225
aVWell, let me say one thing:
p226
aVWe really got access to everybody in the gang.
p227
aVWe got an inside look at the gang, from the very bottom up to the very top.
p228
aVThey trusted Sudhir, in ways that really no academic has ever \u2014
p229
aVor really anybody, any outsider \u2014 has ever earned the trust of these gangs,
p230
aVto the point where they actually opened up
p231
aVwhat was most interesting for me \u2014 their books,
p232
aVthe financial records they kept.
p233
aVThey made them available to us, and we not only could study them,
p234
aVbut we could ask them questions about what was in them.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo if I have to kind of summarize very quickly in the short time I have
p237
aVwhat the bottom line of what I take away from the gang is,
p238
aVit's that, if I had to draw a parallel between the gang
p239
aVand any other organization,
p240
aVit would be that the gang is just like McDonald's,
p241
aVin a lot of different respects \u2014 the restaurant McDonald's.
p242
aa(lp243
VSo first, in one way,
p244
aVwhich isn't maybe the most interesting way, but it's a good way to start \u2014
p245
aVis in the way it's organized, the hierarchy of the gang,
p246
aVthe way it looks.
p247
aVSo here's what the org chart of the gang looks like.
p248
aVI don't know if you know much about org charts,
p249
aVbut if you were to assign a stripped-down and simplified McDonald's org chart,
p250
aVthis is exactly what it would look like.
p251
aVIt's amazing, but the top level of the gang,
p252
aVthey actually call themselves the "Board of Directors."
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
VAnd Sudhir says
p257
aVit's not like these guys had a very sophisticated view
p258
aVof what happened in American corporate life,
p259
aVbut they had seen movies like "Wall Street,"
p260
aVand they had learned a little bit about what it was like
p261
aVto be in the real world.
p262
aVNow, below that board of directors,
p263
aVyou've got essentially what are regional VPs \u2014
p264
aVpeople who control, say, the South Side of Chicago, or the West Side of Chicago.
p265
aa(lp266
VSudhir got to know very well the guy who had the unfortunate assignment
p267
aVof trying to take the Iowa franchise,
p268
aVwhich, it turned out, for this black gang,
p269
aVwas not one of the more brilliant financial endeavors they undertook.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VBut the thing that really makes the gang seem like McDonald's is its franchisees.
p274
aVThe guys who are running the local gangs \u2014
p275
aVthe four-square-block by four-square-block areas \u2014
p276
aVthey're just like the guys, in some sense, who are running the McDonald's.
p277
aVThey are the entrepreneurs.
p278
aVThey get the exclusive property rights to control the drug-selling.
p279
aVThey get the name of the gang behind them, for merchandising and marketing.
p280
aVAnd they're the ones who basically make the profit or lose a profit,
p281
aVdepending on how good they are at running the business.
p282
aa(lp283
VNow, the group I really want you to think about, though,
p284
aVare the ones at the bottom \u2014 the foot soldiers.
p285
aVThese are the teenagers, typically,
p286
aVwho'd be standing out on the street corner, selling the drugs.
p287
aVExtremely dangerous work.
p288
aVAnd important to note is that almost all of the weight, all of the people
p289
aVin this organization are at the bottom \u2014 just like McDonald's.
p290
aVSo in some sense, the foot soldiers are a lot like the people
p291
aVwho are taking your order at McDonald's,
p292
aVand it's not just by chance that they're like them.
p293
aVIn fact, in these neighborhoods, they'd be the same people.
p294
aVSo the same kids who are working in the gang were actually,
p295
aVat the very same time, typically working part-time
p296
aVat a place like McDonald's.
p297
aVWhich already foreshadows the main result that I've talked about,
p298
aVabout what a crappy job it was, being in the gang.
p299
aVBecause obviously, if being in the gang were such a wonderful, lucrative job,
p300
aVwhy in the world would these guys moonlight at McDonald's?
p301
aa(lp302
VSo what do the wages look like? You might be surprised.
p303
aVBut based on being able to talk to them and to see their records,
p304
aVthis is what it looks like in terms of the wages.
p305
aVThe hourly wage the foot soldiers were earning was $3.50 an hour.
p306
aVIt was below the minimum wage. And this is well-documented.
p307
aVIt's easy to see by the patterns of consumption they have.
p308
aVIt really is not fiction \u2014 it's fact.
p309
aVThere was very little money in the gang, especially at the bottom.
p310
aa(lp311
VNow if you managed to rise up, say, and be that local leader,
p312
aVthe guy who's the equivalent of the McDonald's franchisee,
p313
aVyou'd be making 100,000 dollars a year.
p314
aVAnd that, in some ways, was the best job you could hope to get
p315
aVif you were growing up in one of these neighborhoods as a young black male.
p316
aVIf you managed to rise to the very top,
p317
aV200,000 or 400,000 dollars a year is what you'd hope to make.
p318
aVTruly, you would be a great success story.
p319
aa(lp320
VAnd one of the sad parts of this is that, indeed,
p321
aVamong the many other ramifications of crack cocaine
p322
aVis that the most talented individuals in these communities \u2014
p323
aVthis is what they were striving for.
p324
aVThey weren't trying to make it in legitimate ways,
p325
aVbecause there were no legitimate channels out.
p326
aVThis was the best way out.
p327
aVAnd it actually was the right choice, probably,
p328
aVto try to make it out this way.
p329
aa(lp330
VYou look at this,
p331
aVthe relationship to McDonald's breaks down here.
p332
aVThe money looks about the same.
p333
aVWhy is it such a bad job?
p334
aVWell, the reason it's such a bad job is that there's somebody shooting at you
p335
aVa lot of the time.
p336
aVSo, with shooting at you, what are the death rates?
p337
aVWe found, in our gang \u2014
p338
aVand admittedly, this was not really a standard situation;
p339
aVthis was a time of intense violence, of a lot of gang wars,
p340
aVas this gang actually became quite successful.
p341
aVBut there were costs.
p342
aVAnd so the death rate \u2014
p343
aVnot to mention the rate of being arrested, sent to prison, being wounded \u2014
p344
aVthe death rate in our sample was seven percent per person per year.
p345
aVYou're in the gang for four years,
p346
aVyou expect to die with about a 25 percent likelihood.
p347
aVThat is about as high as you can get.
p348
aa(lp349
VSo for comparison's purposes,
p350
aVlet's think about some other walk of life you may expect might be extremely risky.
p351
aVLet's say that you were a murderer
p352
aVand you were convicted of murder, and you're sent to death row.
p353
aVIt turns out, the death rates on death row from all causes, including execution:
p354
aVtwo percent a year.
p355
aa(lp356
V(Laughter)
p357
aa(lp358
VSo it's a lot safer being on death row
p359
aVthan it is selling drugs out on the street.
p360
aa(lp361
VThat gives you some pause, for those of you who believe
p362
aVthat a death penalty's going to have an enormous deterrent effect on crime.
p363
aVTo give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack \u2014
p364
aVand I'm not really focusing on the negatives,
p365
aVbut really, there's another story to tell you there \u2014
p366
aVif you look at the death rates just of random, young black males
p367
aVgrowing up in the inner city in the United States,
p368
aVthe death rates during crack were about one percent.
p369
aVThat's extremely high.
p370
aVAnd this is violent death \u2014 it's unbelievable, in some sense.
p371
aa(lp372
VTo put it into perspective: if you compare this to the soldiers in Iraq,
p373
aVfor instance, right now fighting the war: 0.5 percent.
p374
aVSo in some very literal way,
p375
aVthe young black men who were growing up in this country
p376
aVwere living in a war zone,
p377
aVvery much in the sense that the soldiers over in Iraq are fighting in a war.
p378
aa(lp379
VSo why in the world, you might ask,
p380
aVwould anybody be willing to stand out on a street corner
p381
aVselling drugs for $3.50 an hour,
p382
aVwith a 25 percent chance of dying over the next four years?
p383
aVWhy would they do that?
p384
aVAnd I think there are a couple answers.
p385
aa(lp386
VI think the first one is that they got fooled by history.
p387
aVIt used to be the gang was a rite of passage;
p388
aVthat the young people controlled the gang;
p389
aVthat as you got older, you dropped out of the gang.
p390
aVSo what happened was,
p391
aVthe people who happened to be in the right place at the right time \u2014
p392
aVthe people who happened to be leading the gang in the mid-to-late-'80s \u2014
p393
aVbecame very, very wealthy.
p394
aVAnd so the logical thing to think
p395
aVwas that they are going to age out of the gang
p396
aVlike everybody else has,
p397
aVand the next generation is going to take over and get the wealth.
p398
aa(lp399
VThere are striking similarities, I think, to the Internet boom.
p400
aVThe first set of people in Silicon Valley got very, very rich.
p401
aVAnd then all of my friends said, "Maybe I should go do that, too."
p402
aVAnd they were willing to work very cheap for stock options that never came.
p403
aVIn some sense, that's what happened, exactly,
p404
aVto the set of people we were looking at.
p405
aVThey were willing to start at the bottom,
p406
aVjust like, say, a first-year lawyer at a law firm
p407
aVis willing to start at the bottom,
p408
aVwork 80-hour weeks for not that much money,
p409
aVbecause they think they're going to make partner.
p410
aVBut the rules changed, and they never got to make partner.
p411
aa(lp412
VIndeed, the same people who were running all of the major gangs in the late 1980s
p413
aVare still running the major gangs in Chicago today.
p414
aVThey never passed on any of the wealth,
p415
aVSo everybody got stuck at that $3.50-an-hour job,
p416
aVand it turned out to be a disaster.
p417
aa(lp418
VThe other thing the gang was very good at was marketing and trickery.
p419
aVAnd so for instance, one thing the gang would do is \u2014
p420
aVthe gang leaders would have big entourages,
p421
aVand they'd drive fancy cars and have fancy jewelry.
p422
aVSo what Sudhir eventually realized as he hung out with them more,
p423
aVis that, really, they didn't own those cars \u2014 they just leased them,
p424
aVbecause they couldn't afford to own the fancy cars.
p425
aVAnd they didn't really have gold jewelry, they had gold-plated jewelry.
p426
aVIt goes back to, you know, the real-real versus the fake-real.
p427
aa(lp428
VAnd really, they did all sorts of things to trick the young people
p429
aVinto thinking what a great deal the gang was going to be.
p430
aVSo for instance, they would give a 14-year-old kid
p431
aVa whole roll of bills to hold.
p432
aVThat 14-year-old kid would say to his friends,
p433
aV"Hey, look at all the money I got in the gang."
p434
aVIt wasn't his money \u2014 until he spent it,
p435
aVand then he was in debt to the gang,
p436
aVand was sort of an indentured servant for a while.
p437
aVSo I have a couple minutes.
p438
aa(lp439
VLet me do one last thing I hadn't thought I'd have time to do,
p440
aVwhich is to talk about what we learned more generally about economics,
p441
aVfrom the study of the gang.
p442
aa(lp443
VSo, economists tend to talk in technical words.
p444
aVOften, our theories fail quite miserably when we over the data,
p445
aVbut what's kind of interesting is that in this setting,
p446
aVit turned out that some of the economic theories
p447
aVthat worked not so well in the real economy
p448
aVworked very well in the drug economy,
p449
aVin some sense, because it's unfettered capitalism.
p450
aVHere's an economic principle.
p451
aVThis is one of the basic ideas in labor economics,
p452
aVcalled a "compensating differential."
p453
aVIt's the idea that the increment to wages that a worker requires
p454
aVto leave him indifferent between performing two tasks,
p455
aVone which is more unpleasant than the other.
p456
aVCompensating differential \u2014 it's why we think garbagemen might be paid more
p457
aVthan people who work in parks.
p458
aa(lp459
VThe words of one of the members of the gang, I think, make this clear.
p460
aVSo it turns out \u2014 I'm sort of getting ahead of myself \u2014
p461
aVit turns out, in the gang, when there's a war going on,
p462
aVthey actually pay the foot soldiers twice as much money.
p463
aVIt's exactly this concept.
p464
aVBecause they're not willing to be at risk.
p465
aVAnd the words of a gang member capture it quite nicely, he says:
p466
aV"Would you stand around here when all this shit ..." \u2014 the shooting \u2014
p467
aV"... if all this shit's going on? No, right?
p468
aVSo if I gonna be asked to put my life on the line, then front me the cash, man."
p469
aVI think the gang member says it much more articulately
p470
aVthan the economist, about what's going on.
p471
aa(lp472
V(Laughter)
p473
aa(lp474
VHere's another one.
p475
aVEconomists talk about game theory,
p476
aVthat every two-person game has a Nash equilibrium.
p477
aVHere's the translation you get from the gang member.
p478
aVThey're talking about the decision of why they don't go shoot \u2014
p479
aVOne thing that turns out to be a great business tactic in the gang:
p480
aVif you go and just shoot guns in the air in the other gang's territory \u2014
p481
aVpeople are afraid to go buy drugs there,
p482
aVthey're going to come into your neighborhood.
p483
aa(lp484
VHere's what he says about why they don't do that:
p485
aV"If we start shooting around there, the other gang's territory,
p486
aVnobody, I mean, you dig it, nobody gonna step on their turf.
p487
aVBut we gotta be careful,
p488
aV'cause they can shoot around here too and then we all fucked."
p489
aa(lp490
V(Laughter)
p491
aa(lp492
VSo that's the same concept.
p493
aVThen again, sometimes economists get it wrong.
p494
aVOne thing we observed in the data is that it looked like \u2014
p495
aVthe gang leader always got paid.
p496
aVNo matter how bad it was economically, he always got himself paid.
p497
aa(lp498
VWe had some theories related to cash flow,
p499
aVand lack of access to capital markets, and things like that.
p500
aVThen we asked the gang member,
p501
aV"Why is it you always get paid and your workers don't always get paid?"
p502
aVHis response is,
p503
aV"You got all these niggers below you who want your job, you dig?
p504
aVIf you start taking losses, they see you as weak and shit."
p505
aVAnd I thought about it and said,
p506
aV"CEOs often pay themselves million-dollar bonuses,
p507
aVeven when companies are losing a lot of money.
p508
aVAnd it never would really occur to an economist
p509
aVthat this idea of 'weak and shit' could really be important."
p510
aa(lp511
V(Laughter)
p512
aa(lp513
VMaybe "weak and shit" is an important hypothesis that needs more analysis.
p514
aa(lp515
VThank you very much.
