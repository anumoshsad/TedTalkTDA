VWhat I'm going to show you first, as quickly as I can,
p4
aVis some foundational work, some new technology
p5
aVthat we brought to Microsoft as part of an acquisition
p6
aValmost exactly a year ago.
p7
aVThis is Seadragon, and it's an environment
p8
aVin which you can either locally or remotely interact
p9
aVwith vast amounts of visual data.
p10
aa(lp11
VWe're looking at many, many gigabytes of digital photos here
p12
aVand kind of seamlessly and continuously zooming in,
p13
aVpanning through it, rearranging it in any way we want.
p14
aVAnd it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at,
p15
aVhow big these collections are or how big the images are.
p16
aVMost of them are ordinary digital camera photos,
p17
aVbut this one, for example, is a scan from the Library of Congress,
p18
aVand it's in the 300 megapixel range.
p19
aVIt doesn't make any difference
p20
aVbecause the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one
p21
aVis the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment.
p22
aVIt's also very flexible architecture.
p23
aVThis is an entire book, so this is an example of non-image data.
p24
aVThis is "Bleak House" by Dickens.
p25
aVEvery column is a chapter.
p26
aVTo prove to you that it's really text, and not an image,
p27
aVwe can do something like so, to really show
p28
aVthat this is a real representation of the text; it's not a picture.
p29
aVMaybe this is an artificial way to read an e-book.
p30
aVI wouldn't recommend it.
p31
aa(lp32
VThis is a more realistic case, an issue of The Guardian.
p33
aVEvery large image is the beginning of a section.
p34
aVAnd this really gives you the joy and the good experience
p35
aVof reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper,
p36
aVwhich is an inherently multi-scale kind of medium.
p37
aVWe've done something
p38
aVwith the corner of this particular issue of The Guardian.
p39
aVWe've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution \u2014
p40
aVmuch higher than in an ordinary ad \u2014
p41
aVand we've embedded extra content.
p42
aVIf you want to see the features of this car, you can see it here.
p43
aVOr other models, or even technical specifications.
p44
aVAnd this really gets at some of these ideas
p45
aVabout really doing away with those limits on screen real estate.
p46
aVWe hope that this means no more pop-ups
p47
aVand other rubbish like that \u2014 shouldn't be necessary.
p48
aa(lp49
VOf course, mapping is one of those obvious applications
p50
aVfor a technology like this.
p51
aVAnd this one I really won't spend any time on,
p52
aVexcept to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well.
p53
aVBut those are all the roads in the U.S.
p54
aVsuperimposed on top of a NASA geospatial image.
p55
aVSo let's pull up, now, something else.
p56
aVThis is actually live on the Web now; you can go check it out.
p57
aa(lp58
VThis is a project called Photosynth, which marries two different technologies.
p59
aVOne of them is Seadragon
p60
aVand the other is some very beautiful computer-vision research
p61
aVdone by Noah Snavely, a graduate student at the University of Washington,
p62
aVco-advised by Steve Seitz at U.W.
p63
aVand Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research.
p64
aVA very nice collaboration.
p65
aVAnd so this is live on the Web. It's powered by Seadragon.
p66
aVYou can see that when we do these sorts of views,
p67
aVwhere we can dive through images
p68
aVand have this kind of multi-resolution experience.
p69
aa(lp70
VBut the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful.
p71
aVThe computer vision algorithms have registered these images together
p72
aVso that they correspond to the real space in which these shots \u2014
p73
aVall taken near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies \u2014
p74
aVall these shots were taken.
p75
aVSo you see elements here
p76
aVof stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging,
p77
aVand these things have all been related spatially.
p78
aVI'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments.
p79
aVSome are much more spatial.
p80
aVI would like to jump straight to one of Noah's original data-sets \u2014
p81
aVthis is from an early prototype that we first got working this summer \u2014
p82
aVto show you what I think
p83
aVis really the punch line behind the Photosynth technology,
p84
aVIt's not necessarily so apparent
p85
aVfrom looking at the environments we've put up on the website.
p86
aVWe had to worry about the lawyers and so on.
p87
aa(lp88
VThis is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral
p89
aVthat was done entirely computationally from images scraped from Flickr.
p90
aVYou just type Notre Dame into Flickr,
p91
aVand you get some pictures of guys in T-shirts, and of the campus and so on.
p92
aVAnd each of these orange cones represents an image
p93
aVthat was discovered to belong to this model.
p94
aVAnd so these are all Flickr images,
p95
aVand they've all been related spatially in this way.
p96
aVWe can just navigate in this very simple way.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Applause)
p99
aa(lp100
V(Applause ends)
p101
aa(lp102
VYou know, I never thought that I'd end up working at Microsoft.
p103
aVIt's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here.
p104
aa(lp105
V(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VI guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras:
p108
aVit's everything from cell-phone cameras to professional SLRs,
p109
aVquite a large number of them, stitched together in this environment.
p110
aVIf I can find some of the sort of weird ones \u2014
p111
aVSo many of them are occluded by faces, and so on.
p112
aVSomewhere in here there is actually a series of photographs \u2014 here we go.
p113
aVThis is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly.
p114
aVWe can dive in from the poster
p115
aVto a physical view of this environment.
p116
aa(lp117
VWhat the point here really is
p118
aVis that we can do things with the social environment.
p119
aVThis is now taking data from everybody \u2014
p120
aVfrom the entire collective memory, visually, of what the Earth looks like \u2014
p121
aVand link all of that together.
p122
aVThose photos become linked, and they make something emergent
p123
aVthat's greater than the sum of the parts.
p124
aVYou have a model that emerges of the entire Earth.
p125
aVThink of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth work.
p126
aVAnd this is something that grows in complexity as people use it,
p127
aVand whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it.
p128
aVTheir own photos are getting tagged with meta-data that somebody else entered.
p129
aVIf somebody bothered to tag all of these saints
p130
aVand say who they all are, then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral
p131
aVsuddenly gets enriched with all of that data,
p132
aVand I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space,
p133
aVinto that meta-verse, using everybody else's photos,
p134
aVand do a kind of a cross-modal
p135
aVand cross-user social experience that way.
p136
aVAnd of course, a by-product of all of that is immensely rich virtual models
p137
aVof every interesting part of the Earth,
p138
aVcollected not just from overhead flights and from satellite images
p139
aVand so on, but from the collective memory.
p140
aa(lp141
VThank you so much.

VChris Anderson: Do I understand this right?
p148
aVWhat your software is going to allow,
p149
aVis that at some point, really within the next few years,
p150
aVall the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world
p151
aVare going to link together?
p152
aa(lp153
VBAA: Yes. What this is really doing is discovering,
p154
aVcreating hyperlinks, if you will, between images.
p155
aVIt's doing that based on the content inside the images.
p156
aVAnd that gets really exciting when you think about the richness
p157
aVof the semantic information a lot of images have.
p158
aVLike when you do a web search for images,
p159
aVyou type in phrases,
p160
aVand the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information
p161
aVabout what that picture is of.
p162
aVWhat if that picture links to all of your pictures?
p163
aVThe amount of semantic interconnection and richness
p164
aVthat comes out of that is really huge.
p165
aVIt's a classic network effect.
p166
aa(lp167
VCA: Truly incredible. Congratulations.
