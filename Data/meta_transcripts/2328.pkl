VFor the last 50 years,
p4
aVa lot of smart, well-resourced people \u2014 some of you, no doubt \u2014
p5
aVhave been trying to figure out how to reduce poverty
p6
aVin the United States.
p7
aVPeople have created and invested millions of dollars
p8
aVinto non-profit organizations
p9
aVwith the mission of helping people who are poor.
p10
aa(lp11
VThey've created think tanks
p12
aVthat study issues like education, job creation and asset-building,
p13
aVand then advocated for policies to support our most marginalized communities.
p14
aVThey've written books and columns and given passionate speeches,
p15
aVdecrying the wealth gap that is leaving more and more people
p16
aVentrenched at the bottom end of the income scale.
p17
aVAnd that effort has helped.
p18
aVBut it's not enough.
p19
aVOur poverty rates haven't changed that much in the last 50 years,
p20
aVsince the War on Poverty was launched.
p21
aVI'm here to tell you
p22
aVthat we have overlooked the most powerful and practical resource.
p23
aVHere it is:
p24
aVpeople who are poor.
p25
aa(lp26
VUp in the left-hand corner is Jobana, Sintia and Bertha.
p27
aVThey met when they all had small children,
p28
aVthrough a parenting class at a family resource center
p29
aVin San Francisco.
p30
aVAs they grew together as parents and friends,
p31
aVthey talked a lot about how hard it was
p32
aVto make money when your kids are little.
p33
aVChild care is expensive,
p34
aVmore than they'd earn in a job.
p35
aVTheir husbands worked,
p36
aVbut they wanted to contribute financially, too.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo they hatched a plan.
p39
aVThey started a cleaning business.
p40
aVThey plastered neighborhoods with flyers
p41
aVand handed business cards out to their families and friends,
p42
aVand soon, they had clients calling.
p43
aVTwo of them would clean the office or house
p44
aVand one of them would watch the kids.
p45
aVThey'd rotate who'd cleaned and who'd watch the kids.
p46
aV(Laughs) It's awesome, right?
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd they split the money three ways.
p51
aVIt was not a full-time gig,
p52
aVno one could watch the little ones all day.
p53
aVBut it made a difference for their families.
p54
aVExtra money to pay for bills when a husband's work hours were cut.
p55
aVMoney to buy the kids clothes as they were growing.
p56
aVA little extra money in their pockets
p57
aVto make them feel some independence.
p58
aa(lp59
VUp in the top-right corner is Theresa and her daughter, Brianna.
p60
aVBrianna is one of those kids
p61
aVwith this sparkly, infectious, outgoing personality.
p62
aVFor example, when Rosie,
p63
aVa little girl who spoke only Spanish, moved in next door,
p64
aVBrianna, who spoke only English,
p65
aVborrowed her mother's tablet and found a translation app
p66
aVso the two of them could communicate.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VI know, right?
p71
aVRosie's family credits Brianna with helping Rosie to learn English.
p72
aa(lp73
VA few years ago,
p74
aVBrianna started to struggle academically.
p75
aVShe was growing frustrated and kind of withdrawn
p76
aVand acting out in class.
p77
aVAnd her mother was heartbroken over what was happening.
p78
aVThen they found out that she was going to have to repeat second grade
p79
aVand Brianna was devastated.
p80
aVHer mother felt hopeless and overwhelmed and alone
p81
aVbecause she knew that her daughter was not getting the support she needed,
p82
aVand she did not know how to help her.
p83
aVOne afternoon, Theresa was catching up with a group of friends,
p84
aVand one of them said,
p85
aV"Theresa, how are you?"
p86
aVAnd she burst into tears.
p87
aVAfter she shared her story, one of her friends said,
p88
aV"I went through the exact same thing with my son about a year ago."
p89
aVAnd in that moment,
p90
aVTheresa realized that so much of her struggle
p91
aVwas not having anybody to talk with about it.
p92
aVSo she created a support group for parents like her.
p93
aVThe first meeting was her and two other people.
p94
aVBut word spread, and soon 20 people, 30 people
p95
aVwere showing up for these monthly meetings that she put together.
p96
aVShe went from feeling helpless
p97
aVto realizing how capable she was of supporting her daughter,
p98
aVwith the support of other people who were going through the same struggle.
p99
aVAnd Brianna is doing fantastic \u2014 she's doing great academically
p100
aVand socially.
p101
aa(lp102
VThat in the middle is my man Baakir,
p103
aVstanding in front of BlackStar Books and Caffe,
p104
aVwhich he runs out of part of his house.
p105
aVAs you walk in the door,
p106
aVBaakir greets you with a "Welcome black home."
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VOnce inside, you can order some Algiers jerk chicken,
p111
aVperhaps a vegan walnut burger,
p112
aVor jive turkey sammich.
p113
aVAnd that's sammich \u2014 not sandwich.
p114
aVYou must finish your meal with a buttermilk drop,
p115
aVwhich is several steps above a donut hole
p116
aVand made from a very secret family recipe.
p117
aVFor real, it's very secret, he won't tell you about it.
p118
aa(lp119
VBut BlackStar is much more than a café.
p120
aVFor the kids in the neighborhood,
p121
aVit's a place to go after school to get help with homework.
p122
aVFor the grown-ups, it's where they go
p123
aVto find out what's going on in the neighborhood
p124
aVand catch up with friends.
p125
aVIt's a performance venue.
p126
aVIt's a home for poets, musicians and artists.
p127
aVBaakir and his partner Nicole,
p128
aVwith their baby girl strapped to her back,
p129
aVare there in the mix of it all,
p130
aVserving up a cup of coffee,
p131
aVteaching a child how to play Mancala,
p132
aVor painting a sign for an upcoming community event.
p133
aa(lp134
VI have worked with and learned from people just like them
p135
aVfor more than 20 years.
p136
aVI have organized against the prison system,
p137
aVwhich impacts poor folks,
p138
aVespecially black, indigenous and Latino folks,
p139
aVat an alarming rate.
p140
aVI have worked with young people who manifest hope and promise,
p141
aVdespite being at the effect of racist discipline practices in their schools,
p142
aVand police violence in their communities.
p143
aVI have learned from families
p144
aVwho are unleashing their ingenuity and tenacity
p145
aVto collectively create their own solutions.
p146
aVAnd they're not just focused on money.
p147
aVThey're addressing education, housing, health, community \u2014
p148
aVthe things that we all care about.
p149
aVEverywhere I go,
p150
aVI see people who are broke but not broken.
p151
aVI see people who are struggling to realize their good ideas,
p152
aVso that they can create a better life for themselves,
p153
aVtheir families, their communities.
p154
aVJobana, Sintia, Bertha, Theresa and Baakir are the rule,
p155
aVnot the shiny exception.
p156
aVI am the exception.
p157
aa(lp158
VI was raised by a quietly fierce single mother in Rochester, New York.
p159
aVI was bussed to a school in the suburbs, from a neighborhood
p160
aVthat many of my classmates and their parents considered dangerous.
p161
aVAt eight, I was a latchkey kid.
p162
aVI'd get myself home after school every day and do homework and chores,
p163
aVand wait for my mother to come home.
p164
aVAfter school, I'd go to the corner store
p165
aVand buy a can of Chef Boyardee ravioli,
p166
aVwhich I'd heat up on the stove as my afternoon snack.
p167
aVIf I had a little extra money, I'd buy a Hostess Fruit Pie.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VCherry.
p172
aVNot as good as a buttermilk drop.
p173
aa(lp174
V(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
VWe were poor when I was a kid.
p177
aVBut now, I own a home in a quickly gentrifying neighborhood
p178
aVin Oakland, California.
p179
aVI've built a career.
p180
aVMy husband is a business owner.
p181
aVI have a retirement account.
p182
aVMy daughter is not even allowed to turn on the stove
p183
aVunless there's a grown-up at home
p184
aVand she doesn't have to,
p185
aVbecause she does not have to have the same kind of self-reliance
p186
aVthat I had to at her age.
p187
aVMy kids' raviolis are organic
p188
aVand full of things like spinach and ricotta,
p189
aVbecause I have the luxury of choice
p190
aVwhen it comes to what my children eat.
p191
aa(lp192
VI am the exception,
p193
aVnot because I'm more talented than Baakir
p194
aVor my mother worked any harder than Jobana, Sintia or Bertha,
p195
aVor cared any more than Theresa.
p196
aVMarginalized communities are full of smart, talented people,
p197
aVhustling and working and innovating,
p198
aVjust like our most revered and most rewarded CEOs.
p199
aVThey are full of people tapping into their resilience
p200
aVto get up every day, get the kids off to school
p201
aVand go to jobs that don't pay enough,
p202
aVor get educations that are putting them in debt.
p203
aVThey are full of people applying their savvy intelligence
p204
aVto stretch a minimum wage paycheck,
p205
aVor balance a job and a side hustle to make ends meet.
p206
aVThey are full of people doing for themselves and for others,
p207
aVwhether it's picking up medication for an elderly neighbor,
p208
aVor letting a sibling borrow some money to pay the phone bill,
p209
aVor just watching out for the neighborhood kids
p210
aVfrom the front stoop.
p211
aa(lp212
VI am the exception because of luck and privilege,
p213
aVnot hard work.
p214
aVAnd I'm not being modest or self-deprecating \u2014
p215
aVI am amazing.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VBut most people work hard.
p220
aVHard work is the common denominator in this equation,
p221
aVand I'm tired of the story we tell
p222
aVthat hard work leads to success,
p223
aVbecause that allows \u2014
p224
aa(lp225
VThank you.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Applause)
p228
aa(lp229
V... because that story allows those of us who make it to believe we deserve it,
p230
aVand by implication,
p231
aVthose who don't make it don't deserve it.
p232
aVWe tell ourselves, in the back of our minds,
p233
aVand sometimes in the front of our mouths,
p234
aV"There must be something a little wrong with those poor people."
p235
aVWe have a wide range of beliefs
p236
aVabout what that something wrong is.
p237
aVSome people tell the story that poor folks are lazy freeloaders
p238
aVwho would cheat and lie to get out of an honest day's work.
p239
aVOthers prefer the story that poor people are helpless
p240
aVand probably had neglectful parents that didn't read to them enough,
p241
aVand if they were just told what to do
p242
aVand shown the right path,
p243
aVthey could make it.
p244
aa(lp245
VFor every story I hear demonizing low-income single mothers
p246
aVor absentee fathers,
p247
aVwhich is how people might think of my parents,
p248
aVI've got 50 that tell a different story about the same people,
p249
aVshowing up every day and doing their best.
p250
aVI'm not saying that some of the negative stories aren't true,
p251
aVbut those stories allow us to not really see who people really are,
p252
aVbecause they don't paint a full picture.
p253
aVThe quarter-truths and limited plot lines have us convinced
p254
aVthat poor people are a problem that needs fixing.
p255
aVWhat if we recognized that what's working is the people
p256
aVand what's broken is our approach?
p257
aVWhat if we realized that the experts we are looking for,
p258
aVthe experts we need to follow,
p259
aVare poor people themselves?
p260
aVWhat if, instead of imposing solutions,
p261
aVwe just added fire
p262
aVto the already-burning flame that they have?
p263
aVNot directing \u2014
p264
aVnot even empowering \u2014
p265
aVbut just fueling their initiative.
p266
aa(lp267
VJust north of here,
p268
aVwe have an example of what this could look like:
p269
aVSilicon Valley.
p270
aVA whole venture capital industry has grown up around the belief
p271
aVthat if people have good ideas and the desire to manifest them,
p272
aVwe should give them lots and lots and lots of money.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VRight? But where is our strategy for Theresa and Baakir?
p277
aVThere are no incubators for them,
p278
aVno accelerators, no fellowships.
p279
aVHow are Jobana, Sintia and Bertha really all that different
p280
aVfrom the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world?
p281
aVBaakir has experience and a track record.
p282
aVI'd put my money on him.
p283
aa(lp284
VSo, consider this an invitation to rethink a flawed strategy.
p285
aVLet's grasp this opportunity
p286
aVto let go of a tired, faulty narrative
p287
aVand listen and look for true stories,
p288
aVmore beautifully complex stories,
p289
aVabout who marginalized people and families and communities are.
p290
aa(lp291
VI'm going to take a minute to speak to my people.
p292
aVWe cannot wait
p293
aVfor somebody else to get it right.
p294
aVLet us remember what we are capable of;
p295
aVall that we have built with blood, sweat and dreams;
p296
aVall the cogs that keep turning;
p297
aVand the people kept afloat because of our backbreaking work.
p298
aVLet us remember that we are magic.
p299
aVIf you need some inspiration to jog your memory,
p300
aVread Octavia Butler's "Parable of the Sower."
p301
aVListen to Reverend King's "Letter from Birmingham Jail."
p302
aVListen to Suheir Hammad recite "First Writing Since,"
p303
aVor Esperanza Spalding perform "Black Gold."
p304
aVSet your gaze upon the art of Kehinde Wiley
p305
aVor Favianna Rodriguez.
p306
aVLook at the hands of your grandmother
p307
aVor into the eyes of someone who loves you.
p308
aVWe are magic.
p309
aVIndividually, we don't have a lot of wealth and power,
p310
aVbut collectively, we are unstoppable.
p311
aVAnd we spend a lot of our time and energy
p312
aVorganizing our power to demand change from systems that were not made for us.
p313
aVInstead of trying to alter the fabric of existing ways,
p314
aVlet's weave and cut some fierce new cloth.
p315
aVLet's use some of our substantial collective power
p316
aVtoward inventing and bringing to life
p317
aVnew ways of being that work for us.
p318
aa(lp319
VDesmond Tutu talks about the concept of ubuntu,
p320
aVin the context of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation process
p321
aVthat they embarked on after apartheid.
p322
aVHe says it means,
p323
aV"My humanity is caught up, is inextricably bound up, in yours;
p324
aVwe belong to a bundle of life."
p325
aVA bundle of life.
p326
aVThe Truth and Reconciliation process
p327
aVstarted by elevating the voices of the unheard.
p328
aVIf this country is going to live up to its promise of liberty and justice for all,
p329
aVthen we need to elevate the voices of our unheard,
p330
aVof people like Jobana, Sintia and Bertha,
p331
aVTheresa and Baakir.
p332
aVWe must leverage their solutions and their ideas.
p333
aVWe must listen to their true stories,
p334
aVtheir more beautifully complex stories.
p335
