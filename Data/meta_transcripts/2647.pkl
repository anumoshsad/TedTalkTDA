VWhen people find out I write about time management,
p4
aVthey assume two things.
p5
aVOne is that I'm always on time,
p6
aVand I'm not.
p7
aVI have four small children,
p8
aVand I would like to blame them for my occasional tardiness,
p9
aVbut sometimes it's just not their fault.
p10
aVI was once late to my own speech on time management.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VWe all had to just take a moment together and savor that irony.
p15
aa(lp16
VThe second thing they assume is that I have lots of tips and tricks
p17
aVfor saving bits of time here and there.
p18
aVSometimes I'll hear from magazines that are doing a story along these lines,
p19
aVgenerally on how to help their readers find an extra hour in the day.
p20
aVAnd the idea is that we'll shave bits of time off everyday activities,
p21
aVadd it up,
p22
aVand we'll have time for the good stuff.
p23
aVI question the entire premise of this piece, but I'm always interested
p24
aVin hearing what they've come up with before they call me.
p25
aVSome of my favorites:
p26
aVdoing errands where you only have to make right-hand turns \u2014
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VBeing extremely judicious in microwave usage:
p31
aVit says three to three-and-a-half minutes on the package,
p32
aVwe're totally getting in on the bottom side of that.
p33
aVAnd my personal favorite, which makes sense on some level,
p34
aVis to DVR your favorite shows so you can fast-forward through the commercials.
p35
aVThat way, you save eight minutes every half hour,
p36
aVso in the course of two hours of watching TV,
p37
aVyou find 32 minutes to exercise.
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VWhich is true.
p42
aVYou know another way to find 32 minutes to exercise?
p43
aVDon't watch two hours of TV a day, right?
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VAnyway, the idea is we'll save bits of time here and there, add it up,
p48
aVwe will finally get to everything we want to do.
p49
aVBut after studying how successful people spend their time
p50
aVand looking at their schedules hour by hour,
p51
aVI think this idea has it completely backward.
p52
aVWe don't build the lives we want by saving time.
p53
aVWe build the lives we want,
p54
aVand then time saves itself.
p55
aa(lp56
VHere's what I mean.
p57
aVI recently did a time diary project
p58
aVlooking at 1,001 days in the lives of extremely busy women.
p59
aVThey had demanding jobs, sometimes their own businesses,
p60
aVkids to care for, maybe parents to care for,
p61
aVcommunity commitments \u2014
p62
aVbusy, busy people.
p63
aVI had them keep track of their time for a week
p64
aVso I could add up how much they worked and slept,
p65
aVand I interviewed them about their strategies, for my book.
p66
aa(lp67
VOne of the women whose time log I studied
p68
aVgoes out on a Wednesday night for something.
p69
aVShe comes home to find that her water heater has broken,
p70
aVand there is now water all over her basement.
p71
aVIf you've ever had anything like this happen to you,
p72
aVyou know it is a hugely damaging, frightening, sopping mess.
p73
aVSo she's dealing with the immediate aftermath that night,
p74
aVnext day she's got plumbers coming in,
p75
aVday after that, professional cleaning crew dealing with the ruined carpet.
p76
aVAll this is being recorded on her time log.
p77
aVWinds up taking seven hours of her week.
p78
aVSeven hours.
p79
aVThat's like finding an extra hour in the day.
p80
aa(lp81
VBut I'm sure if you had asked her at the start of the week,
p82
aV"Could you find seven hours to train for a triathlon?"
p83
aV"Could you find seven hours to mentor seven worthy people?"
p84
aVI'm sure she would've said what most of us would've said,
p85
aVwhich is, "No \u2014 can't you see how busy I am?"
p86
aVYet when she had to find seven hours
p87
aVbecause there is water all over her basement,
p88
aVshe found seven hours.
p89
aVAnd what this shows us is that time is highly elastic.
p90
aVWe cannot make more time,
p91
aVbut time will stretch to accommodate what we choose to put into it.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd so the key to time management
p94
aVis treating our priorities
p95
aVas the equivalent of that broken water heater.
p96
aVTo get at this,
p97
aVI like to use language from one of the busiest people I ever interviewed.
p98
aVBy busy, I mean she was running a small business
p99
aVwith 12 people on the payroll,
p100
aVshe had six children in her spare time.
p101
aVI was getting in touch with her to set up an interview
p102
aVon how she "had it all" \u2014 that phrase.
p103
aVI remember it was a Thursday morning,
p104
aVand she was not available to speak with me.
p105
aVOf course, right?
p106
aa(lp107
VBut the reason she was unavailable to speak with me
p108
aVis that she was out for a hike,
p109
aVbecause it was a beautiful spring morning,
p110
aVand she wanted to go for a hike.
p111
aVSo of course this makes me even more intrigued,
p112
aVand when I finally do catch up with her, she explains it like this.
p113
aVShe says, "Listen Laura, everything I do,
p114
aVevery minute I spend, is my choice."
p115
aVAnd rather than say,
p116
aV"I don't have time to do x, y or z,"
p117
aVshe'd say, "I don't do x, y or z because it's not a priority."
p118
aV"I don't have time," often means "It's not a priority."
p119
aVIf you think about it, that's really more accurate language.
p120
aVI could tell you I don't have time to dust my blinds,
p121
aVbut that's not true.
p122
aVIf you offered to pay me $100,000 to dust my blinds,
p123
aVI would get to it pretty quickly.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VSince that is not going to happen,
p128
aVI can acknowledge this is not a matter of lacking time;
p129
aVit's that I don't want to do it.
p130
aVUsing this language reminds us that time is a choice.
p131
aVAnd granted,
p132
aVthere may be horrible consequences for making different choices,
p133
aVI will give you that.
p134
aVBut we are smart people,
p135
aVand certainly over the long run,
p136
aVwe have the power to fill our lives
p137
aVwith the things that deserve to be there.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo how do we do that?
p140
aVHow do we treat our priorities
p141
aVas the equivalent of that broken water heater?
p142
aa(lp143
VWell, first we need to figure out what they are.
p144
aVI want to give you two strategies for thinking about this.
p145
aVThe first, on the professional side:
p146
aVI'm sure many people coming up to the end of the year
p147
aVare giving or getting annual performance reviews.
p148
aVYou look back over your successes over the year,
p149
aVyour "opportunities for growth."
p150
aVAnd this serves its purpose,
p151
aVbut I find it's more effective to do this looking forward.
p152
aVSo I want you to pretend it's the end of next year.
p153
aVYou're giving yourself a performance review,
p154
aVand it has been an absolutely amazing year for you professionally.
p155
aVWhat three to five things did you do that made it so amazing?
p156
aVSo you can write next year's performance review now.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd you can do this for your personal life, too.
p159
aVI'm sure many of you, like me, come December,
p160
aVget cards that contain these folded up sheets of colored paper,
p161
aVon which is written what is known as the family holiday letter.
p162
aa(lp163
V(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VBit of a wretched genre of literature, really,
p166
aVgoing on about how amazing everyone in the household is,
p167
aVor even more scintillating,
p168
aVhow busy everyone in the household is.
p169
aVBut these letters serve a purpose,
p170
aVwhich is that they tell your friends and family
p171
aVwhat you did in your personal life that mattered to you over the year.
p172
aVSo this year's kind of done,
p173
aVbut I want you to pretend it's the end of next year,
p174
aVand it has been an absolutely amazing year
p175
aVfor you and the people you care about.
p176
aVWhat three to five things did you do that made it so amazing?
p177
aVSo you can write next year's family holiday letter now.
p178
aVDon't send it.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VPlease, don't send it.
p183
aVBut you can write it.
p184
aVAnd now, between the performance review and the family holiday letter,
p185
aVwe have a list of six to ten goals we can work on in the next year.
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd now we need to break these down into doable steps.
p188
aVSo maybe you want to write a family history.
p189
aVFirst, you can read some other family histories,
p190
aVget a sense for the style.
p191
aVThen maybe think about the questions you want to ask your relatives,
p192
aVset up appointments to interview them.
p193
aVOr maybe you want to run a 5K.
p194
aVSo you need to find a race and sign up, figure out a training plan,
p195
aVand dig those shoes out of the back of the closet.
p196
aVAnd then \u2014 this is key \u2014
p197
aVwe treat our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater,
p198
aVby putting them into our schedules first.
p199
aVWe do this by thinking through our weeks before we are in them.
p200
aa(lp201
VI find a really good time to do this is Friday afternoons.
p202
aVFriday afternoon is what an economist might call
p203
aVa "low opportunity cost" time.
p204
aVMost of us are not sitting there on Friday afternoons saying,
p205
aV"I am excited to make progress
p206
aVtoward my personal and professional priorities
p207
aVright now."
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VBut we are willing to think about what those should be.
p212
aVSo take a little bit of time Friday afternoon,
p213
aVmake yourself a three-category priority list: career, relationships, self.
p214
aVMaking a three-category list reminds us
p215
aVthat there should be something in all three categories.
p216
aVCareer, we think about;
p217
aVrelationships, self \u2014
p218
aVnot so much.
p219
aVBut anyway, just a short list,
p220
aVtwo to three items in each.
p221
aVThen look out over the whole of the next week,
p222
aVand see where you can plan them in.
p223
aa(lp224
VWhere you plan them in is up to you.
p225
aVI know this is going to be more complicated for some people than others.
p226
aVI mean, some people's lives are just harder than others.
p227
aVIt is not going to be easy to find time to take that poetry class
p228
aVif you are caring for multiple children on your own.
p229
aVI get that.
p230
aVAnd I don't want to minimize anyone's struggle.
p231
aVBut I do think that the numbers I am about to tell you are empowering.
p232
aa(lp233
VThere are 168 hours in a week.
p234
aVTwenty-four times seven is 168 hours.
p235
aVThat is a lot of time.
p236
aVIf you are working a full-time job, so 40 hours a week,
p237
aVsleeping eight hours a night, so 56 hours a week \u2014
p238
aVthat leaves 72 hours for other things.
p239
aVThat is a lot of time.
p240
aVYou say you're working 50 hours a week,
p241
aVmaybe a main job and a side hustle.
p242
aVWell, that leaves 62 hours for other things.
p243
aVYou say you're working 60 hours.
p244
aVWell, that leaves 52 hours for other things.
p245
aVYou say you're working more than 60 hours.
p246
aVWell, are you sure?
p247
aa(lp248
V(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
VThere was once a study comparing people's estimated work weeks
p251
aVwith time diaries.
p252
aVThey found that people claiming 75-plus-hour work weeks
p253
aVwere off by about 25 hours.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
VYou can guess in which direction, right?
p258
aVAnyway, in 168 hours a week,
p259
aVI think we can find time for what matters to you.
p260
aVIf you want to spend more time with your kids,
p261
aVyou want to study more for a test you're taking,
p262
aVyou want to exercise for three hours and volunteer for two,
p263
aVyou can.
p264
aVAnd that's even if you're working way more than full-time hours.
p265
aa(lp266
VSo we have plenty of time, which is great,
p267
aVbecause guess what?
p268
aVWe don't even need that much time to do amazing things.
p269
aVBut when most of us have bits of time, what do we do?
p270
aVPull out the phone, right?
p271
aVStart deleting emails.
p272
aVOtherwise, we're puttering around the house
p273
aVor watching TV.
p274
aa(lp275
VBut small moments can have great power.
p276
aVYou can use your bits of time
p277
aVfor bits of joy.
p278
aVMaybe it's choosing to read something wonderful on the bus
p279
aVon the way to work.
p280
aVI know when I had a job that required two bus rides
p281
aVand a subway ride every morning,
p282
aVI used to go to the library on weekends to get stuff to read.
p283
aVIt made the whole experience almost, almost, enjoyable.
p284
aVBreaks at work can be used for meditating or praying.
p285
aVIf family dinner is out because of your crazy work schedule,
p286
aVmaybe family breakfast could be a good substitute.
p287
aa(lp288
VIt's about looking at the whole of one's time
p289
aVand seeing where the good stuff can go.
p290
aVI truly believe this.
p291
aVThere is time.
p292
aVEven if we are busy,
p293
aVwe have time for what matters.
p294
aVAnd when we focus on what matters,
p295
aVwe can build the lives we want
p296
aVin the time we've got.
p297
aa(lp298
VThank you.
