VThere is something you know about me,
p4
aVsomething very personal,
p5
aVand there is something I know about every one of you
p6
aVand that's very central to your concerns.
p7
aVThere is something that we know
p8
aVabout everyone we meet anywhere in the world, on the street,
p9
aVthat is the very mainspring of whatever they do
p10
aVand whatever they put up with.
p11
aVAnd that is that all of us want to be happy.
p12
aVIn this, we are all together.
p13
aVHow we imagine our happiness, that differs from one another,
p14
aVbut it's already a lot that we have all in common,
p15
aVthat we want to be happy.
p16
aa(lp17
VNow my topic is gratefulness.
p18
aVWhat is the connection between happiness and gratefulness?
p19
aVMany people would say, well, that's very easy.
p20
aVWhen you are happy, you are grateful.
p21
aVBut think again.
p22
aVIs it really the happy people that are grateful?
p23
aVWe all know quite a number of people
p24
aVwho have everything that it would take to be happy,
p25
aVand they are not happy,
p26
aVbecause they want something else or they want more of the same.
p27
aVAnd we all know people who have lots of misfortune,
p28
aVmisfortune that we ourselves would not want to have,
p29
aVand they are deeply happy.
p30
aVThey radiate happiness. You are surprised.
p31
aVWhy? Because they are grateful.
p32
aVSo it is not happiness that makes us grateful.
p33
aVIt's gratefulness that makes us happy.
p34
aVIf you think it's happiness that makes you grateful,
p35
aVthink again.
p36
aVIt's gratefulness that makes you happy.
p37
aa(lp38
VNow, we can ask,
p39
aVwhat do we really mean by gratefulness?
p40
aVAnd how does it work?
p41
aVI appeal to your own experience.
p42
aVWe all know from experience how it goes.
p43
aVWe experience something that's valuable to us.
p44
aVSomething is given to us that's valuable to us.
p45
aVAnd it's really given.
p46
aVThese two things have to come together.
p47
aVIt has to be something valuable, and it's a real gift.
p48
aVYou haven't bought it. You haven't earned it.
p49
aVYou haven't traded it in. You haven't worked for it.
p50
aVIt's just given to you.
p51
aVAnd when these two things come together,
p52
aVsomething that's really valuable to me and I realize it's freely given,
p53
aVthen gratefulness spontaneously rises in my heart,
p54
aVhappiness spontaneously rises in my heart.
p55
aVThat's how gratefulness happens.
p56
aa(lp57
VNow the key to all this
p58
aVis that we cannot only experience this once in a while.
p59
aVWe cannot only have grateful experiences.
p60
aVWe can be people who live gratefully.
p61
aVGrateful living, that is the thing.
p62
aVAnd how can we live gratefully?
p63
aVBy experiencing, by becoming aware
p64
aVthat every moment is a given moment, as we say.
p65
aVIt's a gift. You haven't earned it.
p66
aVYou haven't brought it about in any way.
p67
aVYou have no way of assuring
p68
aVthat there will be another moment given to you,
p69
aVand yet, that's the most valuable thing that can ever be given to us,
p70
aVthis moment, with all the opportunity that it contains.
p71
aVIf we didn't have this present moment,
p72
aVwe wouldn't have any opportunity to do anything
p73
aVor experience anything,
p74
aVand this moment is a gift.
p75
aVIt's a given moment, as we say.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow, we say the gift within this gift is really the opportunity.
p78
aVWhat you are really grateful for is the opportunity,
p79
aVnot the thing that is given to you,
p80
aVbecause if that thing were somewhere else
p81
aVand you didn't have the opportunity to enjoy it,
p82
aVto do something with it,
p83
aVyou wouldn't be grateful for it.
p84
aVOpportunity is the gift within every gift,
p85
aVand we have this saying, opportunity knocks only once.
p86
aVWell, think again.
p87
aVEvery moment is a new gift, over and over again,
p88
aVand if you miss the opportunity of this moment,
p89
aVanother moment is given to us, and another moment.
p90
aVWe can avail ourselves of this opportunity,
p91
aVor we can miss it,
p92
aVand if we avail ourselves of the opportunity,
p93
aVit is the key to happiness.
p94
aVBehold the master key to our happiness
p95
aVin our own hands.
p96
aVMoment by moment, we can be grateful for this gift.
p97
aa(lp98
VDoes that mean
p99
aVthat we can be grateful for everything?
p100
aVCertainly not.
p101
aVWe cannot be grateful for violence, for war,
p102
aVfor oppression, for exploitation.
p103
aVOn the personal level, we cannot be grateful
p104
aVfor the loss of a friend, for unfaithfulness,
p105
aVfor bereavement.
p106
aVBut I didn't say we can be grateful for everything.
p107
aVI said we can be grateful in every given moment
p108
aVfor the opportunity,
p109
aVand even when we are confronted with something that is terribly difficult,
p110
aVwe can rise to this occasion
p111
aVand respond to the opportunity that is given to us.
p112
aVIt isn't as bad as it might seem.
p113
aVActually, when you look at it and experience it,
p114
aVyou find that most of the time,
p115
aVwhat is given to us is the opportunity to enjoy,
p116
aVand we only miss it because we are rushing through life
p117
aVand we are not stopping to see the opportunity.
p118
aa(lp119
VBut once in a while,
p120
aVsomething very difficult is given to us,
p121
aVand when this difficult thing occurs to us,
p122
aVit's a challenge to rise to that opportunity,
p123
aVand we can rise to it by learning something
p124
aVwhich is sometimes painful.
p125
aVLearning patience, for instance.
p126
aVWe have been told that the road to peace
p127
aVis not a sprint, but is more like a marathon.
p128
aVThat takes patience. That's difficult.
p129
aVIt may be to stand up for your opinion, to stand up for your conviction.
p130
aVThat's an opportunity that is given to us.
p131
aVTo learn, to suffer, to stand up,
p132
aVall these opportunities are given to us,
p133
aVbut they are opportunities,
p134
aVand those who avail themselves of those opportunities
p135
aVare the ones that we admire.
p136
aVThey make something out of life.
p137
aVAnd those who fail get another opportunity.
p138
aVWe always get another opportunity.
p139
aVThat's the wonderful richness of life.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo how can we find a method that will harness this?
p142
aVHow can each one of us find a method for living gratefully,
p143
aVnot just once in a while being grateful,
p144
aVbut moment by moment to be grateful.
p145
aVHow can we do it? It's a very simple method.
p146
aVIt's so simple that it's actually what we were told as children
p147
aVwhen we learned to cross the street.
p148
aVStop.
p149
aVLook.
p150
aVGo.
p151
aVThat's all.
p152
aVBut how often do we stop?
p153
aVWe rush through life. We don't stop.
p154
aVWe miss the opportunity because we don't stop.
p155
aVWe have to stop.
p156
aVWe have to get quiet.
p157
aVAnd we have to build stop signs into our lives.
p158
aa(lp159
VWhen I was in Africa some years ago and then came back,
p160
aVI noticed water.
p161
aVIn Africa where I was, I didn't have drinkable water.
p162
aVEvery time I turned on the faucet, I was overwhelmed.
p163
aVEvery time I clicked on the light, I was so grateful.
p164
aVIt made me so happy.
p165
aVBut after a while, this wears off.
p166
aVSo I put little stickers on the light switch
p167
aVand on the water faucet,
p168
aVand every time I turned it on, water.
p169
aVSo leave it up to your own imagination.
p170
aVYou can find whatever works best for you,
p171
aVbut you need stop signs in your life.
p172
aVAnd when you stop,
p173
aVthen the next thing is to look.
p174
aVYou look. You open your eyes.
p175
aVYou open your ears. You open your nose.
p176
aVYou open all your senses
p177
aVfor this wonderful richness that is given to us.
p178
aVThere is no end to it, and that is what life is all about,
p179
aVto enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd then we can also open our hearts,
p182
aVour hearts for the opportunities,
p183
aVfor the opportunities also to help others,
p184
aVto make others happy,
p185
aVbecause nothing makes us more happy than when all of us are happy.
p186
aVAnd when we open our hearts to the opportunities,
p187
aVthe opportunities invite us to do something,
p188
aVand that is the third.
p189
aVStop, look, and then go, and really do something.
p190
aVAnd what we can do
p191
aVis whatever life offers to you in that present moment.
p192
aVMostly it's the opportunity to enjoy,
p193
aVbut sometimes it's something more difficult.
p194
aa(lp195
VBut whatever it is, if we take this opportunity,
p196
aVwe go with it, we are creative, those are the creative people.
p197
aVAnd that little stop, look, go,
p198
aVis such a potent seed
p199
aVthat it can revolutionize our world.
p200
aVBecause we are at the present moment
p201
aVin the middle of a change of consciousness,
p202
aVand you will be surprised if you \u2014
p203
aVI am always surprised when I hear how many times
p204
aVthis word "gratefulness" and "gratitude" comes up.
p205
aVEverywhere you find it,
p206
aVa grateful airline, a restaurant gratefulness,
p207
aVa café gratefulness, a wine that is gratefulness.
p208
aVYes, I have even come across a toilet paper
p209
aVwhose brand is called "Thank You."
p210
aa(lp211
V(Laughter)
p212
aa(lp213
VThere is a wave of gratefulness
p214
aVbecause people are becoming aware how important this is
p215
aVand how this can change our world.
p216
aVIt can change our world in immensely important ways,
p217
aVbecause if you're grateful, you're not fearful,
p218
aVand if you're not fearful, you're not violent.
p219
aVIf you're grateful, you act out of a sense of enough
p220
aVand not of a sense of scarcity,
p221
aVand you are willing to share.
p222
aVIf you are grateful,
p223
aVyou are enjoying the differences between people,
p224
aVand you are respectful to everybody,
p225
aVand that changes this power pyramid under which we live.
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd it doesn't make for equality, but it makes for equal respect,
p228
aVand that is the important thing.
p229
aVThe future of the world will be a network,
p230
aVnot a pyramid turned upside down.
p231
aVThe revolution of which I am speaking is a nonviolent revolution,
p232
aVand it's so revolutionary that it even revolutionizes
p233
aVthe very concept of a revolution,
p234
aVbecause the normal revolution
p235
aVis one where the power pyramid is turned upside down
p236
aVand those who were on the bottom are now on the top
p237
aVand are doing exactly the same thing that the ones before.
p238
aVWhat we need is a networking of smaller groups,
p239
aVsmaller and smaller groups who know one another,
p240
aVwho interact with one another, and that is a grateful world.
p241
aa(lp242
VA grateful world is a world of joyful people.
p243
aVGrateful people are joyful people,
p244
aVand joyful people \u2014
p245
aVthe more and more joyful people there are,
p246
aVthe more and more we'll have a joyful world.
p247
aVWe have a network for grateful living, and it has mushroomed.
p248
aVWe couldn't understand why it mushroomed.
p249
aVWe have an opportunity for people to light a candle
p250
aVwhen they are grateful for something.
p251
aVAnd there have been 15 million candles lit in one decade.
p252
aVPeople are becoming aware that a grateful world is a happy world,
p253
aVand we all have the opportunity by the simple stop, look, go,
p254
aVto transform the world, to make it a happy place.
p255
aVAnd that is what I hope for us,
p256
aVand if this has contributed a little to making you want to do the same,
p257
aVstop, look, go.
p258
aa(lp259
