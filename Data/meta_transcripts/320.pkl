VI got my first computer when I was a teenager growing up in Accra,
p4
aVand it was a really cool device.
p5
aVYou could play games with it. You could program it in BASIC.
p6
aVAnd I was fascinated.
p7
aVSo I went into the library to figure out how did this thing work.
p8
aVI read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth
p9
aVbetween the memory, the RAM and the ALU,
p10
aVthe arithmetic and logic unit.
p11
aVAnd I thought to myself, this CPU really has to work like crazy
p12
aVjust to keep all this data moving through the system.
p13
aa(lp14
VBut nobody was really worried about this.
p15
aVWhen computers were first introduced,
p16
aVthey were said to be a million times faster than neurons.
p17
aVPeople were really excited. They thought they would soon outstrip
p18
aVthe capacity of the brain.
p19
aVThis is a quote, actually, from Alan Turing:
p20
aV"In 30 years, it will be as easy to ask a computer a question
p21
aVas to ask a person."
p22
aVThis was in 1946. And now, in 2007, it's still not true.
p23
aVAnd so, the question is, why aren't we really seeing
p24
aVthis kind of power in computers that we see in the brain?
p25
aa(lp26
VWhat people didn't realize, and I'm just beginning to realize right now,
p27
aVis that we pay a huge price for the speed
p28
aVthat we claim is a big advantage of these computers.
p29
aVLet's take a look at some numbers.
p30
aVThis is Blue Gene, the fastest computer in the world.
p31
aVIt's got 120,000 processors; they can basically process
p32
aV10 quadrillion bits of information per second.
p33
aVThat's 10 to the sixteenth. And they consume one and a half megawatts of power.
p34
aVSo that would be really great, if you could add that
p35
aVto the production capacity in Tanzania.
p36
aVIt would really boost the economy.
p37
aVJust to go back to the States,
p38
aVif you translate the amount of power or electricity
p39
aVthis computer uses to the amount of households in the States,
p40
aVyou get 1,200 households in the U.S.
p41
aVThat's how much power this computer uses.
p42
aa(lp43
VNow, let's compare this with the brain.
p44
aVThis is a picture of, actually Rory Sayres' girlfriend's brain.
p45
aVRory is a graduate student at Stanford.
p46
aVHe studies the brain using MRI, and he claims that
p47
aVthis is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVSo that's true love, right there.
p50
aVNow, how much computation does the brain do?
p51
aVI estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second,
p52
aVwhich is actually about very similar to what Blue Gene does.
p53
aVSo that's the question. The question is, how much \u2014
p54
aVthey are doing a similar amount of processing, similar amount of data \u2014
p55
aVthe question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use?
p56
aVAnd it's actually as much as your laptop computer:
p57
aVit's just 10 watts.
p58
aVSo what we are doing right now with computers
p59
aVwith the energy consumed by 1,200 houses,
p60
aVthe brain is doing with the energy consumed by your laptop.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo the question is, how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency?
p63
aVAnd let me just summarize. So the bottom line:
p64
aVthe brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy
p65
aVthan we do right now with this computer technology that we have.
p66
aVHow is the brain able to do this?
p67
aVLet's just take a look about how the brain works,
p68
aVand then I'll compare that with how computers work.
p69
aVSo, this clip is from the PBS series, "The Secret Life of the Brain."
p70
aVIt shows you these cells that process information.
p71
aVThey are called neurons.
p72
aVThey send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other,
p73
aVand where they contact each other, those little pulses
p74
aVof electricity can jump from one neuron to the other.
p75
aVThat process is called a synapse.
p76
aVYou've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other \u2014
p77
aVabout 100 million of them,
p78
aVsending about 10 quadrillion of these pulses around every second.
p79
aVAnd that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this.
p80
aa(lp81
VHow does that compare with the way computers work?
p82
aVIn the computer, you have all the data
p83
aVgoing through the central processing unit,
p84
aVand any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck,
p85
aVwhereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons,
p86
aVand the data just really flows through a network of connections
p87
aVamong the neurons. There's no bottleneck here.
p88
aVIt's really a network in the literal sense of the word.
p89
aVThe net is doing the work in the brain.
p90
aVIf you just look at these two pictures,
p91
aVthese kind of words pop into your mind.
p92
aVThis is serial and it's rigid \u2014 it's like cars on a freeway,
p93
aVeverything has to happen in lockstep \u2014
p94
aVwhereas this is parallel and it's fluid.
p95
aVInformation processing is very dynamic and adaptive.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo I'm not the first to figure this out. This is a quote from Brian Eno:
p98
aV"the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them."
p99
aV(Laughter)
p100
aVBrian actually said this in 1995.
p101
aVAnd nobody was listening then,
p102
aVbut now people are beginning to listen
p103
aVbecause there's a pressing, technological problem that we face.
p104
aVAnd I'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides.
p105
aa(lp106
VThis is \u2014 it's actually really this remarkable convergence
p107
aVbetween the devices that we use to compute in computers,
p108
aVand the devices that our brains use to compute.
p109
aVThe devices that computers use are what's called a transistor.
p110
aVThis electrode here, called the gate, controls the flow of current
p111
aVfrom the source to the drain \u2014 these two electrodes.
p112
aVAnd that current, electrical current,
p113
aVis carried by electrons, just like in your house and so on.
p114
aVAnd what you have here is, when you actually turn on the gate,
p115
aVyou get an increase in the amount of current, and you get a steady flow of current.
p116
aVAnd when you turn off the gate, there's no current flowing through the device.
p117
aVYour computer uses this presence of current to represent a one,
p118
aVand the absence of current to represent a zero.
p119
aa(lp120
VNow, what's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller,
p121
aVthey no longer behave like this.
p122
aVIn fact, they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute,
p123
aVwhich is called an ion channel.
p124
aVAnd this is a little protein molecule.
p125
aVI mean, neurons have thousands of these.
p126
aVAnd it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it.
p127
aVAnd these are individual potassium ions
p128
aVthat are flowing through that pore.
p129
aVNow, this pore can open and close.
p130
aVBut, when it's open, because these ions have to line up
p131
aVand flow through, one at a time, you get a kind of sporadic, not steady \u2014
p132
aVit's a sporadic flow of current.
p133
aVAnd even when you close the pore \u2014 which neurons can do,
p134
aVthey can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity \u2014
p135
aVeven when it's closed, because these ions are so small,
p136
aVthey can actually sneak through, a few can sneak through at a time.
p137
aVSo, what you have is that when the pore is open,
p138
aVyou get some current sometimes.
p139
aVThese are your ones, but you've got a few zeros thrown in.
p140
aVAnd when it's closed, you have a zero,
p141
aVbut you have a few ones thrown in.
p142
aa(lp143
VNow, this is starting to happen in transistors.
p144
aVAnd the reason why that's happening is that, right now, in 2007 \u2014
p145
aVthe technology that we are using \u2014 a transistor is big enough
p146
aVthat several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously, side by side.
p147
aVIn fact, there's about 12 electrons can all be flowing this way.
p148
aVAnd that means that a transistor corresponds
p149
aVto about 12 ion channels in parallel.
p150
aVNow, in a few years time, by 2015, we will shrink transistors so much.
p151
aVThis is what Intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip.
p152
aVOr your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte
p153
aVof stuff on them \u2014 before, it was 256.
p154
aVTransistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen,
p155
aVand technology has really benefitted from that.
p156
aa(lp157
VBut what's happening now is that in 2015, the transistor is going to become so small,
p158
aVthat it corresponds to only one electron at a time
p159
aVcan flow through that channel,
p160
aVand that corresponds to a single ion channel.
p161
aVAnd you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel.
p162
aVThe current will turn on and off at random,
p163
aVeven when it's supposed to be on.
p164
aVAnd that means your computer is going to get
p165
aVits ones and zeros mixed up, and that's going to crash your machine.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo, we are at the stage where we
p168
aVdon't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices.
p169
aVAnd the only kind of thing \u2014 the only thing we know right now
p170
aVthat can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain.
p171
aa(lp172
VOK, so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory,
p173
aVit sends it into the processor or the ALU,
p174
aVand then it puts the result back into memory.
p175
aVThat's the red path that's highlighted.
p176
aVThe way brains work, I told you all, you have got all these neurons.
p177
aVAnd the way they represent information is
p178
aVthey break up that data into little pieces
p179
aVthat are represented by pulses and different neurons.
p180
aVSo you have all these pieces of data
p181
aVdistributed throughout the network.
p182
aVAnd then the way that you process that data to get a result
p183
aVis that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity,
p184
aVjust by it flowing through the network.
p185
aVSo you set up these connections
p186
aVsuch that the input pattern just flows
p187
aVand generates the output pattern.
p188
aa(lp189
VWhat you see here is that there's these redundant connections.
p190
aVSo if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered,
p191
aVit doesn't show up over here, these two pieces can activate the missing part
p192
aVwith these redundant connections.
p193
aVSo even when you go to these crappy devices
p194
aVwhere sometimes you want a one and you get a zero, and it doesn't show up,
p195
aVthere's redundancy in the network
p196
aVthat can actually recover the missing information.
p197
aVIt makes the brain inherently robust.
p198
aVWhat you have here is a system where you store data locally.
p199
aVAnd it's brittle, because each of these steps has to be flawless,
p200
aVotherwise you lose that data, whereas in the brain, you have a system
p201
aVthat stores data in a distributed way, and it's robust.
p202
aa(lp203
VWhat I want to basically talk about is my dream,
p204
aVwhich is to build a computer that works like the brain.
p205
aVThis is something that we've been working on for the last couple of years.
p206
aVAnd I'm going to show you a system that we designed
p207
aVto model the retina,
p208
aVwhich is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball.
p209
aVWe didn't do this by actually writing code, like you do in a computer.
p210
aVIn fact, the processing that happens
p211
aVin that little piece of brain is very similar
p212
aVto the kind of processing that computers
p213
aVdo when they stream video over the Internet.
p214
aVThey want to compress the information \u2014
p215
aVthey just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on \u2014
p216
aVand that is how your eyeball
p217
aVis able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve,
p218
aVto send to the rest of the brain.
p219
aa(lp220
VInstead of doing this in software, or doing those kinds of algorithms,
p221
aVwe went and talked to neurobiologists
p222
aVwho have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina.
p223
aVAnd they figured out all the different cells,
p224
aVand they figured out the network, and we just took that network
p225
aVand we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip.
p226
aVSo now the neurons are represented by little nodes or circuits on the chip,
p227
aVand the connections among the neurons are represented, actually modeled by transistors.
p228
aVAnd these transistors are behaving essentially
p229
aVjust like ion channels behave in the brain.
p230
aVIt will give you the same kind of robust architecture that I described.
p231
aa(lp232
VHere is actually what our artificial eye looks like.
p233
aVThe retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here.
p234
aVAnd the chip \u2014 I'm going to show you a video
p235
aVthat the silicon retina put out of its output
p236
aVwhen it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul,
p237
aVwho's the student who designed this chip.
p238
aVLet me explain what you're going to see, OK,
p239
aVbecause it's putting out different kinds of information,
p240
aVit's not as straightforward as a camera.
p241
aVThe retina chip extracts four different kinds of information.
p242
aVIt extracts regions with dark contrast,
p243
aVwhich will show up on the video as red.
p244
aVAnd it extracts regions with white or light contrast,
p245
aVwhich will show up on the video as green.
p246
aa(lp247
VThis is Kareem's dark eyes
p248
aVand that's the white background that you see here.
p249
aVAnd then it also extracts movement.
p250
aVWhen Kareem moves his head to the right,
p251
aVyou will see this blue activity there;
p252
aVit represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image,
p253
aVthat's where it's going from dark to light.
p254
aVAnd you also see this yellow activity,
p255
aVwhich represents regions where contrast is decreasing;
p256
aVit's going from light to dark.
p257
aVAnd these four types of information \u2014
p258
aVyour optic nerve has about a million fibers in it,
p259
aVand 900,000 of those fibers
p260
aVsend these four types of information.
p261
aVSo we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve.
p262
aa(lp263
VWhat you notice here is that these snapshots
p264
aVtaken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse, right?
p265
aVIt doesn't light up green everywhere in the background,
p266
aVonly on the edges, and then in the hair, and so on.
p267
aVAnd this is the same thing you see
p268
aVwhen people compress video to send: they want to make it very sparse,
p269
aVbecause that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing,
p270
aVand it's doing it just with the circuitry, and how this network of neurons
p271
aVthat are interacting in there, which we've captured on the chip.
p272
aa(lp273
VBut the point that I want to make \u2014 I'll show you up here.
p274
aVSo this image here is going to look like these ones,
p275
aVbut here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image,
p276
aVso, you know, you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there.
p277
aVAnd so, here you go.
p278
aVYes, so that's the idea.
p279
aVWhen you stand still, you just see the light and dark contrasts.
p280
aVBut when it's moving back and forth,
p281
aVthe retina picks up these changes.
p282
aVAnd that's why, you know, when you're sitting here
p283
aVand something happens in your background,
p284
aVyou merely move your eyes to it.
p285
aVThere are these cells that detect change
p286
aVand you move your attention to it.
p287
aVSo those are very important for catching somebody
p288
aVwho's trying to sneak up on you.
p289
aa(lp290
VLet me just end by saying that this is what happens
p291
aVwhen you put Africa in a piano, OK.
p292
aVThis is a steel drum here that has been modified,
p293
aVand that's what happens when you put Africa in a piano.
p294
aVAnd what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer,
p295
aVand come up with a new kind of computer
p296
aVthat will generate thought, imagination, be creative and things like that.
p297
aVThank you.
p298
aV(Applause)
p299
aa(lp300
VChris Anderson: Question for you, Kwabena.
p301
aVDo you put together in your mind the work you're doing,
p302
aVthe future of Africa, this conference \u2014
p303
aVwhat connections can we make, if any, between them?
p304
aa(lp305
VKwabena Boahen: Yes, like I said at the beginning,
p306
aVI got my first computer when I was a teenager, growing up in Accra.
p307
aVAnd I had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it.
p308
aVIt was very brute force; it was very inelegant.
p309
aVI don't think that I would've had that reaction,
p310
aVif I'd grown up reading all this science fiction,
p311
aVhearing about RD2D2, whatever it was called, and just \u2014 you know,
p312
aVbuying into this hype about computers.
p313
aVI was coming at it from a different perspective,
p314
aVwhere I was bringing that different perspective
p315
aVto bear on the problem.
p316
aVAnd I think a lot of people in Africa have this different perspective,
p317
aVand I think that's going to impact technology.
p318
aVAnd that's going to impact how it's going to evolve.
p319
aVAnd I think you're going to be able to see, use that infusion,
p320
aVto come up with new things,
p321
aVbecause you're coming from a different perspective.
p322
aVI think we can contribute. We can dream like everybody else.
p323
aa(lp324
VCA: Thanks Kwabena, that was really interesting.
