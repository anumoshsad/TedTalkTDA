VPat Mitchell: You have brought us images from the Yemen Times.
p4
aVAnd take us through those,
p5
aVand introduce us to another Yemen.
p6
aa(lp7
VNadia Al-Sakkaf: Well, I'm glad to be here.
p8
aVAnd I would like to share with you all
p9
aVsome of the pictures that are happening today in Yemen.
p10
aVThis picture shows a revolution
p11
aVstarted by women,
p12
aVand it shows women and men
p13
aVleading a mixed protest.
p14
aVThe other picture
p15
aVis the popularity of the real need for change.
p16
aVSo many people are there.
p17
aVThe intensity of the upspring.
p18
aVThis picture shows that the revolution
p19
aVhas allowed opportunities for training,
p20
aVfor education.
p21
aVThese women are learning about first aid
p22
aVand their rights according to the constitution.
p23
aa(lp24
VI love this picture.
p25
aVI just wanted to show
p26
aVthat over 60 percent of the Yemeni population
p27
aVare 15 years and below.
p28
aVAnd they were excluded from decision-making,
p29
aVand now they are in the forefront of the news,
p30
aVraising the flag.
p31
aVEnglish \u2014
p32
aVyou will see, this is jeans
p33
aVand tights,
p34
aVand an English expression \u2014
p35
aVthe ability to share with the world
p36
aVwhat is going on in our own country.
p37
aVAnd expression also,
p38
aVit has brought talents.
p39
aVYemenis are using cartoons
p40
aVand art,
p41
aVpaintings, comics,
p42
aVto tell the world and each other
p43
aVabout what's going on.
p44
aa(lp45
VObviously, there's always the dark side of it.
p46
aVAnd this is just one of the less-gruesome pictures
p47
aVof the revolution
p48
aVand the cost that we have to pay.
p49
aVThe solidarity
p50
aVof millions of Yemenis across the country
p51
aVjust demanding the one thing.
p52
aVAnd finally, lots of people are saying
p53
aVthat Yemen's revolution
p54
aVis going to break the country.
p55
aVIs it going to be so many different countries?
p56
aVIs it going to be another Somalia?
p57
aVBut we want to tell the world that, no,
p58
aVunder the one flag, we'll still remain as Yemeni people.
p59
aa(lp60
VPM: Thank you for those images, Nadia.
p61
aVAnd they do, in many ways,
p62
aVtell a different story
p63
aVthan the story of Yemen,
p64
aVthe one that is often in the news.
p65
aVAnd yet, you yourself
p66
aVdefy all those characterizations.
p67
aVSo let's talk about the personal story for a moment.
p68
aVYour father is murdered.
p69
aVThe Yemen Times already has
p70
aVa strong reputation in Yemen
p71
aVas an independent English language newspaper.
p72
aVHow did you then
p73
aVmake the decision and assume the responsibilities
p74
aVof running a newspaper,
p75
aVespecially in such times of conflict?
p76
aa(lp77
VNA: Well, let me first warn you
p78
aVthat I'm not the traditional Yemeni girl.
p79
aVI've guessed you've already noticed this by now.
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aVIn Yemen, most women are veiled
p82
aVand they are sitting behind doors
p83
aVand not very much part of the public life.
p84
aVBut there's so much potential.
p85
aVI wish I could show you my Yemen.
p86
aVI wish you could see
p87
aVYemen through my eyes.
p88
aVThen you would know
p89
aVthat there's so much to it.
p90
aVAnd I was privileged because I was born into a family,
p91
aVmy father would always encourage the boys and the girls.
p92
aVHe would say we are equal.
p93
aVAnd he was such an extraordinary man.
p94
aVAnd even my mother \u2014 I owe it to my family.
p95
aVA story:
p96
aVI studied in India.
p97
aVAnd in my third year, I started becoming confused
p98
aVbecause I was Yemeni,
p99
aVbut I was also mixing up
p100
aVwith a lot of my friends in college.
p101
aVAnd I went back home and I said,
p102
aV"Daddy, I don't know who I am.
p103
aVI'm not a Yemeni; I'm not an Indian."
p104
aVAnd he said, "You are the bridge."
p105
aVAnd that is something I will keep in my heart forever.
p106
aVSo since then I've been the bridge,
p107
aVand a lot of people have walked over me.
p108
aa(lp109
VPM: I don't think so. (Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VNA: But it just helps tell
p112
aVthat some people are change agents
p113
aVin the society.
p114
aVAnd when I became editor-in-chief
p115
aVafter my brother actually \u2014
p116
aVmy father passed away in 1999,
p117
aVand then my brother until 2005 \u2014
p118
aVand everybody was betting that I will not be able to do it.
p119
aV"What's this young girl coming in and showing off
p120
aVbecause it's her family business," or something.
p121
aVIt was very hard at first.
p122
aVI didn't want to clash with people.
p123
aVBut with all due respect
p124
aVto all the men, and the older men especially,
p125
aVthey did not want me around.
p126
aVIt was very hard, you know,
p127
aVto impose my authority.
p128
aVBut a woman's got to do what a woman's got to do.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Applause)
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd in the first year,
p133
aVI had to fire half of the men.
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aV(Applause)
p136
aVBrought in more women.
p137
aVBrought in younger men.
p138
aVAnd we have a more gender-balanced newsroom today.
p139
aVThe other thing is that it's about professionalism.
p140
aVIt's about proving who you are and what you can do.
p141
aVAnd I don't know if I'm going to be boasting now,
p142
aVbut in 2006 alone,
p143
aVwe won three international awards.
p144
aVOne of them is the IPI
p145
aVFree Media Pioneer Award.
p146
aVSo that was the answer
p147
aVto all the Yemeni people.
p148
aVAnd I want to score a point here,
p149
aVbecause my husband is in the room over there.
p150
aVIf you could please stand up, [unclear].
p151
aVHe has been very supportive of me.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Applause)
p154
aa(lp155
VPM: And we should point out
p156
aVthat he works with you as well at the paper.
p157
aVBut in assuming this responsibility
p158
aVand going about it as you have,
p159
aVyou have become a bridge
p160
aVbetween an older and traditional society
p161
aVand the one that you are now creating at the paper.
p162
aVAnd so along with changing who worked there,
p163
aVyou must have come up against another positioning
p164
aVthat we always run into, in particular with women,
p165
aVand it has to do with outside image,
p166
aVdress, the veiled woman.
p167
aVSo how have you dealt with this
p168
aVon a personal level
p169
aVas well as the women who worked for you?
p170
aa(lp171
VNA: As you know,
p172
aVthe image of a lot of Yemeni women is a lot of black
p173
aVand covered, veiled women.
p174
aVAnd this is true.
p175
aVAnd a lot of it is
p176
aVbecause women are not able, are not free,
p177
aVto show their face to their self.
p178
aVIt's a lot of traditional imposing
p179
aVcoming by authority figures
p180
aVsuch as the men, the grandparents and so on.
p181
aVAnd it's economic empowerment
p182
aVand the ability for a woman to say,
p183
aV"I am as much contributing to this family, or more,
p184
aVthan you are."
p185
aVAnd the more empowered the women become,
p186
aVthe more they are able to remove the veil, for example,
p187
aVor to drive their own car
p188
aVor to have a job or to be able to travel.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo the other face of Yemen
p191
aVis actually one
p192
aVthat lies behind the veil,
p193
aVand it's economic empowerment mostly
p194
aVthat allows the woman to just uncover it.
p195
aVAnd I have done this throughout my work.
p196
aVI've tried to encourage young girls.
p197
aVWe started with, you can take it off in the office.
p198
aVAnd then after that, you can take it off on assignments.
p199
aVBecause I didn't believe a journalist can be a journalist with \u2014
p200
aVhow can you talk to people if you have your face covered? \u2014
p201
aVand so on; it's just a movement.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd I am a role model in Yemen.
p204
aVA lot of people look up to me.
p205
aVA lot of young girls look up to me.
p206
aVAnd I need to prove to them that, yes, you can still be married,
p207
aVyou can still be a mother,
p208
aVand you can still be respected within the society,
p209
aVbut at the same time,
p210
aVthat doesn't mean you [should] just be one of the crowd.
p211
aVYou can be yourself and have your face.
p212
aa(lp213
VPM: But by putting yourself personally out there \u2014
p214
aVboth projecting a different image
p215
aVof Yemeni women,
p216
aVbut also what you have made possible
p217
aVfor the women who work at the paper \u2014
p218
aVhas this put you in personal danger?
p219
aa(lp220
VNA: Well the Yemen Times, across 20 years,
p221
aVhas been through so much.
p222
aVWe've suffered prosecution;
p223
aVthe paper was closed down more than three times.
p224
aVIt's an independent newspaper,
p225
aVbut tell that to the people in charge.
p226
aVThey think that if there's anything against them,
p227
aVthen we are being an opposition newspaper.
p228
aVAnd very, very difficult times.
p229
aVSome of my reporters were arrested.
p230
aVWe had some court cases.
p231
aVMy father was assassinated.
p232
aVToday, we are in a much better situation.
p233
aVWe've created the credibility.
p234
aVAnd in times of revolution or change like today,
p235
aVit is very important for independent media to have a voice.
p236
aVIt's very important
p237
aVfor you to go to YemenTimes.com,
p238
aVand it's very important
p239
aVto listen to our voice.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd this is probably something
p242
aVI'm going to share with you
p243
aVin Western media probably \u2014
p244
aVand how there's a lot of stereotypes \u2014
p245
aVthinking of Yemen in one single frame:
p246
aVthis is what Yemen is all about.
p247
aVAnd that's not fair.
p248
aVIt's not fair for me; it's not fair for my country.
p249
aVA lot of reporters come to Yemen
p250
aVand they want to write a story on Al-Qaeda or terrorism.
p251
aVAnd I just wanted to share with you:
p252
aVthere's one reporter that came.
p253
aVHe wanted to do a documentary
p254
aVon what his editors wanted.
p255
aVAnd he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me \u2014
p256
aVhip hop \u2014
p257
aVthat there are young Yemeni men
p258
aVwho express themselves
p259
aVthrough dancing and puchu puchu.
p260
aV(Laughter)
p261
aVThat thing. (PM: Rap. Break dancing.)
p262
aVYeah, break dancing.
p263
aVI'm not so old.
p264
aVI'm just not in touch.
p265
aa(lp266
V(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
V(Applause)
p269
aa(lp270
VPM: Yes, you are.
p271
aVActually, that's a documentary
p272
aVthat's available online; the video's online.
p273
aa(lp274
VNA: ShaketheDust.org.
p275
aa(lp276
VPM: "Shake the Dust." (NA: "Shake the Dust.")
p277
aa(lp278
VPM: ShaketheDust.org.
p279
aVAnd it definitely does give a different image of Yemen.
p280
aVYou spoke about the responsibility of the press.
p281
aVAnd certainly, when we look
p282
aVat the ways in which we have separated ourselves from others
p283
aVand we've created fear
p284
aVand danger,
p285
aVoften from lack of knowledge,
p286
aVlack of real understanding,
p287
aVhow do you see
p288
aVthe way that the Western press in particular
p289
aVis covering this and all other stories out of the region,
p290
aVbut in particular, in your country?
p291
aa(lp292
VNA: Well there is a saying that says,
p293
aV"You fear what you don't know,
p294
aVand you hate what you fear."
p295
aVSo it's about the lack of research, basically.
p296
aVIt's almost, "Do your homework," \u2014
p297
aVsome involvement.
p298
aVAnd you cannot do parachute reporting \u2014
p299
aVjust jump into a country for two days
p300
aVand think that you've done your homework and a story.
p301
aVSo I wish
p302
aVthat the world would know my Yemen,
p303
aVmy country, my people.
p304
aVI am an example, and there are others like me.
p305
aVWe may not be that many,
p306
aVbut if we are promoted
p307
aVas a good, positive example,
p308
aVthere will be others \u2014 men and women \u2014
p309
aVwho can eventually bridge the gap \u2014
p310
aVagain, coming to the bridge \u2014
p311
aVbetween Yemen and the world
p312
aVand telling first
p313
aVabout recognition
p314
aVand then about communication
p315
aVand compassion.
p316
aa(lp317
VI think Yemen is going to be
p318
aVin a very bad situation
p319
aVin the next two or three years.
p320
aVIt's natural.
p321
aVBut after the two years, which is a price we are willing to pay,
p322
aVwe are going to stand up again on our feet,
p323
aVbut in the new Yemen
p324
aVwith a younger and more empowered people \u2014
p325
aVdemocratic.
p326
aa(lp327
V(Applause)
p328
aa(lp329
VPM: Nadia, I think you've just given us
p330
aVa very different view of Yemen.
p331
aVAnd certainly you yourself and what you do
p332
aVhave given us a view of the future
p333
aVthat we will embrace
p334
aVand be grateful for.
p335
aVAnd the very best of luck to you.
