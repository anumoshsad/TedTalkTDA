VHow do we build a society
p4
aVwithout fossil fuels?
p5
aa(lp6
VThis is a very complex challenge,
p7
aVand I believe developing countries could take the lead in this transition.
p8
aVAnd I'm aware that this is a contentious statement,
p9
aVbut the reality is that so much is at stake in our countries
p10
aVif we let fossil fuels stay at the center of our development.
p11
aVWe can do it differently.
p12
aVAnd it's time, it really is time,
p13
aVto debunk the myth
p14
aVthat a country has to choose between development on the one hand
p15
aVand environmental protection, renewables, quality of life, on the other.
p16
aa(lp17
VI come from Costa Rica, a developing country.
p18
aVWe are nearly five million people,
p19
aVand we live right in the middle of the Americas,
p20
aVso it's very easy to remember where we live.
p21
aVNearly 100 percent of our electricity
p22
aVcomes from renewable sources,
p23
aVfive of them.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Applause)
p26
aa(lp27
VHydropower, geothermal,
p28
aVwind, solar, biomass.
p29
aa(lp30
VDid you know that last year,
p31
aVfor 299 days,
p32
aVwe did not use any fossil fuels
p33
aVin order to generate all our electricity?
p34
aVIt's a fantastic achievement,
p35
aVand yet, it hides a paradox,
p36
aVwhich is that nearly 70 percent
p37
aVof all our energy consumption is oil.
p38
aa(lp39
VWhy?
p40
aVBecause of our transportation system,
p41
aVwhich is totally dependent on fossil fuels,
p42
aVlike it is in most countries.
p43
aVSo if we think of the energy transition as a marathon,
p44
aVthe question is, how do we get to the finish line,
p45
aVhow do we decarbonize the rest of the economy?
p46
aVAnd it's fair to say that if we don't succeed,
p47
aVit's difficult to see who will.
p48
aVSo that is why I want to talk to you about Costa Rica,
p49
aVbecause I believe we are a great candidate
p50
aVin pioneering a vision for development without fossil fuels.
p51
aa(lp52
VIf you know one thing about our country,
p53
aVit's that we don't have an army.
p54
aVSo I'm going to take you back to 1948.
p55
aVThat year, the country was coming out of civil war.
p56
aVThousands of Costa Ricans had died,
p57
aVand families were bitterly split.
p58
aVAnd yet, a surprising idea won the hearts and minds:
p59
aVwe would reboot the country,
p60
aVand that Second Republic would have no army.
p61
aVSo we abolished it.
p62
aVAnd the president at the time,
p63
aVJosé Figueres,
p64
aVfound a powerful way by smashing the walls of an army base.
p65
aVThe following year, 1949,
p66
aVwe made that decision permanent in the new constitution,
p67
aVand that is why I can tell you that story nearly 70 years later.
p68
aVAnd I'm grateful.
p69
aVI'm grateful they made that decision before I was born,
p70
aVbecause it allowed me and millions of others
p71
aVto live in a very stable country.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd you might be thinking that it was good luck,
p74
aVbut it wasn't.
p75
aVThere was a pattern of deliberate choices.
p76
aVIn the '40s, Costa Ricans were given free education and free health care.
p77
aVWe called that social guarantees.
p78
aVBy abolishing the army,
p79
aVwe were able to turn military spending into social spending,
p80
aVand that was a driver of stability.
p81
aVIn the '50s \u2014
p82
aa(lp83
V(Applause)
p84
aa(lp85
VIn the '50s, we started investing in hydropower,
p86
aVand that kept us away from the trap
p87
aVof using fossil fuels for electricity generation,
p88
aVwhich is what the world is struggling with today.
p89
aVIn the '70s we invested in national parks,
p90
aVand that kept us away
p91
aVfrom the deeply flawed logic of growth, growth, growth at any cost
p92
aVthat you see others embracing, especially in the developing world.
p93
aVIn the '90s, we pioneered payments for ecosystem services,
p94
aVand that helped us reverse deforestation
p95
aVand boosted ecotourism, which today is a key engine of growth.
p96
aVSo investing in environmental protection
p97
aVdid not hurt our economy.
p98
aVQuite the opposite.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd it doesn't mean we are perfect,
p101
aVand it doesn't mean we don't have contradictions.
p102
aVThat's not the point.
p103
aVThe point is that, by making our own choices,
p104
aVwe were able to develop resilience in dealing with development problems.
p105
aa(lp106
VAlso, if you take a country like ours,
p107
aVthe GDP per capita is around 11,000 dollars,
p108
aVdepending on how you measure it.
p109
aVBut according to the Social Progress Index,
p110
aVwe are an absolute outlier
p111
aVwhen it comes to turning GDP into social progress.
p112
aVAbolishing the army,
p113
aVinvesting in nature and people,
p114
aVdid something very powerful, too.
p115
aVIt shaped the narrative,
p116
aVthe narrative of a small country with big ideas,
p117
aVand it was very empowering to grow up with that narrative.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo the question is,
p120
aVwhat is the next big idea for this generation?
p121
aVAnd I believe what comes next
p122
aVis for this generation to let go of fossil fuels for good,
p123
aVjust as we did with the army.
p124
aa(lp125
VFossil fuels create climate change.
p126
aVWe know that,
p127
aVand we know how vulnerable we are to the impacts of climate change.
p128
aVSo as a developing country, it is in our best interest
p129
aVto build development without fossil fuels
p130
aVthat harm people in the first place.
p131
aVBecause
p132
aVwhy would we continue importing oil
p133
aVfor transportation
p134
aVif we can use electricity instead?
p135
aa(lp136
VRemember,
p137
aVthis is the country
p138
aVwhere electricity comes from water in our rivers,
p139
aVheat from volcanoes,
p140
aVwind turbines, solar panels,
p141
aVbiowaste.
p142
aVAbolishing fossil fuels means disrupting our transportation system
p143
aVso that we can power our cars, buses and trains with electricity
p144
aVinstead of dirty energy.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd transportation, let me tell you,
p147
aVhas become an existential issue for us Costa Ricans,
p148
aVbecause the model we have is not working for us.
p149
aVIt's hurting people,
p150
aVit's hurting companies,
p151
aVand it's hurting our health.
p152
aa(lp153
VBecause when policies and infrastructure fail,
p154
aVthis is what happens on a daily basis.
p155
aVTwo hours in the morning,
p156
aVtwo hours in the evening.
p157
aVI don't understand why we have to accept this as normal.
p158
aVIt's offensive
p159
aVto have to waste our time like this every single day.
p160
aVAnd this highway is actually quite good
p161
aVcompared to what you see in other countries
p162
aVwhere traffic is exploding.
p163
aVYou know, Costa Ricans call this "presa."
p164
aVPresa means "imprisoned."
p165
aVAnd people are turning violent
p166
aVin a country that is otherwise happy in pura vida.
p167
aVIt's happening.
p168
aVSo a lot is at stake.
p169
aa(lp170
VThe good news
p171
aVis that when we talk about clean transportation
p172
aVand different mobility,
p173
aVwe're not talking about some distant utopia out there.
p174
aVWe're talking about electric mobility that is happening today.
p175
aVBy 2022, electric cars and conventional cars
p176
aVare expected to cost the same,
p177
aVand cities are already trying electric buses.
p178
aVAnd these really cool creatures
p179
aVare saving money,
p180
aVand they reduce pollution.
p181
aVSo if we want to get rid of oil-based transportation, we can,
p182
aVbecause we have options now that we didn't have before.
p183
aVIt's really exciting.
p184
aa(lp185
VBut of course,
p186
aVsome get very uncomfortable with this idea,
p187
aVand they will come and they will tell you
p188
aVthat the world is stuck with oil, and so is Costa Rica, so get real.
p189
aVThat's what they tell you.
p190
aVAnd you know what the answer to that argument is?
p191
aVThat in 1948, we didn't say the world is stuck with armies,
p192
aVso let's keep our army, too.
p193
aVNo, we made a very brave choice,
p194
aVand that choice made the whole difference.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo it's time for this generation to be brave again
p197
aVand abolish fossil fuels for good.
p198
aVAnd I'll give you three reasons why we have to do this.
p199
aa(lp200
VFirst,
p201
aVour model of transportation and urbanization is broken,
p202
aVso this is the best moment to redefine our urban and mobility future.
p203
aVWe don't want cities that are built for cars.
p204
aVWe want cities for people
p205
aVwhere we can walk and we can use bikes.
p206
aVAnd we want public transportation,
p207
aVlots of it,
p208
aVpublic transportation that is clean and dignifying.
p209
aVBecause if we continue adding fleets of conventional cars,
p210
aVour cities will become unbearable.
p211
aa(lp212
VSecond, we have to change,
p213
aVbut incremental change is not going to be sufficient.
p214
aVWe need transformational change.
p215
aVAnd there are some incremental projects in my country,
p216
aVand I am the first one to celebrate them.
p217
aVBut let's not kid ourselves.
p218
aVWe're not talking about ending up with really beautiful electric cars here
p219
aVand a few electric buses there
p220
aVwhile we keep investing in the same kind of infrastructure,
p221
aVmore cars, more roads, more oil.
p222
aVWe're talking about breaking free from oil,
p223
aVand you cannot get there through incrementalism.
p224
aa(lp225
VThird, and you know this one,
p226
aVthe world is hungry for inspiration.
p227
aVIt craves stories of success
p228
aVin dealing with complex issues,
p229
aVespecially in developing countries.
p230
aVSo I believe Costa Rica can be an inspiration to others,
p231
aVas we did last year when we disclosed
p232
aVthat for so many days we were not using any fossil fuels
p233
aVin order to generate all our electricity.
p234
aVThe news went viral around the world.
p235
aVAlso, and this makes me extremely proud,
p236
aVa Costa Rican woman, Christiana Figueres,
p237
aVplayed a decisive role in the negotiations of the Paris climate agreement.
p238
aVSo we have to protect that legacy and be an example.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo what comes next?
p241
aVThe people.
p242
aVHow do we get people to own this?
p243
aVHow do we get people
p244
aVto believe that it's possible
p245
aVto build a society without fossil fuels?
p246
aVA lot of work from the ground up is needed.
p247
aa(lp248
VThat is why, in 2014, we created Costa Rica Limpia.
p249
aV"Limpia" means "clean,"
p250
aVbecause we want to empower and we want to inspire citizens.
p251
aVIf citizens don't get engaged,
p252
aVclean transportation decisions will be bogged down by endless,
p253
aVand I mean endless, technical discussions,
p254
aVand by avalanches of lobbying by various established interests.
p255
aVWanting to be a green country powered by renewables
p256
aVis already part of our story.
p257
aVWe should not let anybody take that away from us.
p258
aa(lp259
VLast year, we brought people from our seven provinces
p260
aVto talk about climate change in terms that matter to them,
p261
aVand we also brought this year
p262
aVanother group of Costa Ricans
p263
aVto talk about renewable energy.
p264
aVAnd you know what?
p265
aVThese people disagree on almost everything
p266
aVexcept on renewable energy
p267
aVand clean transportation and clean air.
p268
aVIt brings people together.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd the key to real participation
p271
aVis to help people not to feel small.
p272
aVPeople feel powerless,
p273
aVand they are tired of not being heard.
p274
aVSo what we do is concrete things,
p275
aVand we translate technical issues into citizen language
p276
aVto show that citizens have a role to play and can play it together.
p277
aVFor the first time, we're tracking the promises that were made
p278
aVon clean transportation,
p279
aVand politicos know that they have to deliver it,
p280
aVbut the tipping point will come when we form coalitions \u2014
p281
aVcitizens, companies,
p282
aVchampions of public transportation \u2014
p283
aVthat will make electric mobility the new normal,
p284
aVespecially in a developing country.
p285
aa(lp286
VBy the time the next election comes,
p287
aVI believe every candidate will have to disclose where they stand
p288
aVon the abolition of fossil fuels.
p289
aVBecause this question has to enter our mainstream politics.
p290
aVAnd I'm telling you, this is not a question of climate policy
p291
aVor environmental agenda.
p292
aVIt's about the country that we want
p293
aVand the cities that we have
p294
aVand the cities that we want
p295
aVand who makes that choice.
p296
aVBecause at the end of the day, what we have to show
p297
aVis that development with renewable energy
p298
aVis good for the people,
p299
aVfor Costa Ricans that are alive today
p300
aVand especially for those who haven't been born.
p301
aa(lp302
VThis is our National Museum today.
p303
aVIt's bright and peaceful,
p304
aVand when you stand up in front of it,
p305
aVit's really hard to believe these were military barracks
p306
aVat the end of the '40s.
p307
aVWe started a new life without an army in this place,
p308
aVand here is where our abolition
p309
aVof fossil fuels will be announced one day.
p310
aVAnd we will make history again.
p311
aa(lp312
VThank you.
