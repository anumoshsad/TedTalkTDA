VSo I really consider myself a storyteller.
p4
aVBut I don't really tell stories in the usual way,
p5
aVin the sense that I don't usually tell my own stories.
p6
aVInstead, I'm really interested in building tools that allow
p7
aVlarge numbers of other people to tell their stories,
p8
aVpeople all around the world.
p9
aVI do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common.
p10
aVI think people are very similar,
p11
aVbut I also think that we have trouble seeing that.
p12
aa(lp13
VYou know, as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps,
p14
aVand I think we all see a lot of gaps.
p15
aVAnd we define ourselves by our gaps.
p16
aVThere's language gaps,
p17
aVthere's ethnicity and racial gaps, there's age gaps,
p18
aVthere's gender gaps, there's sexuality gaps,
p19
aVthere's wealth and money gaps, there's education gaps,
p20
aVthere's also religious gaps.
p21
aVYou know, we have all these gaps and I think we like our gaps
p22
aVbecause they make us feel like we identify with something,
p23
aVsome smaller community.
p24
aVBut I think that actually, despite our gaps,
p25
aVwe really have a lot in common.
p26
aVAnd I think one thing we have in common is a very deep need
p27
aVto express ourselves.
p28
aVI think this is a very old human desire. It's nothing new.
p29
aa(lp30
VBut the thing about self-expression
p31
aVis that there's traditionally been this imbalance
p32
aVbetween the desire that we have to express ourselves
p33
aVand the number of sympathetic friends
p34
aVwho are willing to stand around and listen.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VThis, also, is nothing new.
p39
aVSince the dawn of human history, we've tried to rectify this imbalance
p40
aVby making art, writing poems, singing songs,
p41
aVscripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper,
p42
aVgossiping with friends. This is nothing new.
p43
aa(lp44
VWhat's new is that in the last several years
p45
aVa lot of these very traditional physical human activities,
p46
aVthese acts of self-expression, have been moving onto the Internet.
p47
aVAnd as that's happened, people have been leaving behind footprints,
p48
aVfootprints that tell stories of their moments of self-expression.
p49
aVAnd so what I do is, I write computer programs
p50
aVthat study very large sets of these footprints,
p51
aVand then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them \u2014
p52
aVwhat they feel, what they think,
p53
aVwhat's different in the world today than usual,
p54
aVthese sorts of questions.
p55
aa(lp56
VOne project that explores these ideas,
p57
aVwhich was made about a year ago,
p58
aVis a piece called We Feel Fine.
p59
aVThis is a piece that every two or three minutes
p60
aVscans the world's newly-posted blog entries
p61
aVfor occurrences of the phrases "I feel" or "I am feeling."
p62
aVAnd when it finds one of those phrases,
p63
aVit grabs the sentence up to the period,
p64
aVand then automatically tries to deduce the age, gender
p65
aVand geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence.
p66
aVThen, knowing the geographical location and the time,
p67
aVwe can also then figure out the weather
p68
aVwhen that person wrote the sentence.
p69
aVAll of this information is saved in a database
p70
aVthat collects about 20,000 feelings a day.
p71
aVIt's been running for about a year and a half.
p72
aVIt's reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now.
p73
aVAnd I'll show you a glimpse
p74
aVof how this information is then visualized. So this is We Feel Fine.
p75
aa(lp76
VWhat you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles,
p77
aVeach of which represents a single human feeling
p78
aVthat was stated in the last few hours.
p79
aVThe color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside \u2014
p80
aVso that happy, positive feelings are brightly colored.
p81
aVAnd sad, negative feelings are darkly colored.
p82
aVThe diameter of each dot
p83
aVrepresents the length of the sentence inside,
p84
aVso that the large dots contain large sentences,
p85
aVand the small dots contain small sentences.
p86
aVAny dot can be clicked and expanded. And we see here,
p87
aV"I would just feel so much better
p88
aVif I could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me
p89
aVin the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips."
p90
aVSo it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes
p91
aVin the world of human emotions.
p92
aVAnd all of these are stated by people:
p93
aV"I know that objectively it really doesn't mean much,
p94
aVbut after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond,
p95
aVit's nice to feel bigger again."
p96
aa(lp97
VThe dots exhibit human qualities. They kind of have their own physics,
p98
aVand they swarm wildly around, kind of exploring the world of life.
p99
aVAnd then they also exhibit curiosity.
p100
aVYou can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now.
p101
aVYou can see some other ones
p102
aVare swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen
p103
aVaround six words. Those six words represent the six movements
p104
aVof We Feel Fine. We're currently seeing Madness.
p105
aVThere's also Murmurs, Montage, Mobs, Metrics and Mounds.
p106
aVAnd I'll walk you through a few of those now.
p107
aVMurmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling.
p108
aVAnd then, one by one, in reverse chronological order,
p109
aVthey excuse themselves, entering the scrolling list of feelings.
p110
aV"I feel a bit better now."
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
V"I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do."
p115
aV"I feel gypped out of something awesome here."
p116
aV"I feel so free; I feel so good."
p117
aV"I feel like I'm in this fog of depression that I can't get out of."
p118
aVAnd you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog
p119
aVfrom which it was collected. And in that way,
p120
aVyou can connect with the authors of these statements
p121
aVif you feel some degree of empathy.
p122
aa(lp123
VThe next movement is called Montage.
p124
aVMontage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs
p125
aVto become extracted and display themselves in a grid.
p126
aVThis grid is then said to represent the picture of the world's feelings
p127
aVin the last few hours, if you will.
p128
aVEach of these can be clicked and we can blow it up.
p129
aVWe see, "I just feel like I'm not going to have fun
p130
aVif it's not the both of us." That was from someone in Michigan.
p131
aVWe see, "I feel like I have been at a computer all day."
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VThese are automatically constructed using the found objects:
p136
aV"I think I feel a little full."
p137
aa(lp138
VThe next movement is called mobs.
p139
aVMobs provides different statistical breakdowns
p140
aVof the population of the world's feelings in the last few hours.
p141
aVWe see that "better" is the most frequent feeling right now,
p142
aVfollowed by "good," "bad," "guilty," "right," "down," "sick" and so on.
p143
aVWe can also get a gender breakdown.
p144
aVAnd we see that women are slightly more prolific
p145
aVtalking about their emotions in the last few hours than men.
p146
aVWe can do an age breakdown, which gives us a histogram
p147
aVof the world's emotional distribution by age.
p148
aVWe see people in their twenties are the most prolific,
p149
aVfollowed by teenagers, and then people in their thirties,
p150
aVand it dies out very quickly from there.
p151
aVIn weather, the feelings assume the physical characteristics
p152
aVof the weather that they represent,
p153
aVso that the ones collected on a sunny day
p154
aVswirl around as if they're part of the sun.
p155
aVThe cloudy ones float along as if they're on a breeze.
p156
aVThe rainy ones fall down as if they're in a rainstorm,
p157
aVand the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground.
p158
aa(lp159
VFinally, location causes the feelings to move to their positions
p160
aVon a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings.
p161
aVMetrics provides more numerical views on the data.
p162
aVWe see that the world is feeling "used"
p163
aVat 3.3 times the normal level right now.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VThey're feeling "warm" at 2.9 times the normal level, and so on.
p168
aVOther views are also available.
p169
aVHere are gender, age, weather, location.
p170
aa(lp171
VThe final movement is called Mounds.
p172
aVIt's a bit different from the others.
p173
aVMounds visualizes the entire dataset as large, gelatinous blobs
p174
aVwhich kind of jiggle.
p175
aVAnd if I hold down my cursor, they do a little dance.
p176
aVWe see "better" is the most frequent feeling, followed by "bad."
p177
aVAnd then if I go over here, the list begins to scroll,
p178
aVand there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected.
p179
aVYou can see the little pink cursor moving along,
p180
aVrepresenting our position.
p181
aVHere we see people that feel "slipping," "nauseous," "responsible."
p182
aa(lp183
VThere's also a search capability,
p184
aVif you're interested in finding out about a certain population.
p185
aVFor instance, you could find women who feel "addicted"
p186
aVin their 20s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VBut I'll spare you that.
p191
aVSo here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected:
p192
aV"I feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn't even room for me."
p193
aV"I feel very lonely."
p194
aV"I need to be in some backwoods redneck town
p195
aVso that I can feel beautiful."
p196
aV"I feel invisible to you."
p197
aV"I wouldn't hide it if society didn't make me feel like I needed to."
p198
aV"I feel in love with Carolyn." "I feel so naughty."
p199
aV"I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life."
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
V"I love how I feel today."
p204
aa(lp205
VSo as you can see, We Feel Fine uses a technique
p206
aVthat I call "passive observation."
p207
aVWhat I mean by that is that it passively observes people
p208
aVas they live their lives. It scans the world's blogs
p209
aVand looks at what people are writing,
p210
aVand these people don't know they're being watched or interviewed.
p211
aVAnd because of that,
p212
aVyou end up getting very honest, candid, sincere responses
p213
aVthat are often very moving.
p214
aVAnd this is a technique that I usually prefer in my work
p215
aVbecause people don't know they're being interviewed.
p216
aVThey're just living life, and they end up just acting like that.
p217
aa(lp218
VAnother technique is directly questioning people.
p219
aVAnd this is a technique that I explored in a different project,
p220
aVthe Yahoo! Time Capsule,
p221
aVwhich was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006.
p222
aVIt was divided into ten very simple themes \u2014
p223
aVlove, anger, sadness and so on \u2014
p224
aVeach of which contained a single, very open-ended question
p225
aVput to the world: What do you love? What makes you angry?
p226
aVWhat makes you sad? What do you believe in? And so on.
p227
aVThe time capsule was available for one month online,
p228
aVtranslated into 10 languages, and this is what it looked like.
p229
aVIt's a spinning globe,
p230
aVthe surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures
p231
aVand words and drawings of people
p232
aVthat submitted to the time capsule.
p233
aVThe ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule.
p234
aVYou can sift through this data and see what people have submitted.
p235
aVThis is in response to, What's beautiful? "Miss World."
p236
aa(lp237
VThere are two modes to the time capsule.
p238
aVThere's One World, which presents the spinning globe,
p239
aVand Many Voices, which splits the data out into film strips
p240
aVand lets you sift through them one by one.
p241
aVSo this project was punctuated by a really amazing event,
p242
aVwhich was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexico
p243
aVat the Jemez Pueblo, where for three consecutive nights,
p244
aVthe contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides
p245
aVof the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls,
p246
aVwhich stand about 200 feet tall. It was really incredible.
p247
aVAnd we also projected the contents of the time capsule
p248
aVas binary code using a 35-watt laser into outer space.
p249
aVYou can see the orange line leaving the desert floor
p250
aVat about a 45 degree angle there. This was amazing
p251
aVbecause the first night I looked at all this information
p252
aVand really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier \u2014
p253
aVthe differences in age, gender and wealth and so on.
p254
aa(lp255
VBut, you know, as I looked at this more and more and more,
p256
aVand saw these images go across the rocks,
p257
aVI realized I was seeing the same archetypal events
p258
aVdepicted again and again and again.
p259
aVYou know: weddings, births, funerals, the first car, the first kiss,
p260
aVthe first camel or horse \u2014 depending on the culture.
p261
aVAnd it was really moving. And this picture here was taken
p262
aVthe final night from a distant cliff about two miles away,
p263
aVwhere the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space.
p264
aVAnd there was something very moving
p265
aVabout all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky.
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd it started to make me think a lot about the night sky,
p268
aVand how humans have always used the night sky
p269
aVto project their great stories.
p270
aVYou know, as a child in Vermont, on a farm where I grew up,
p271
aVI would often look up into the dark sky
p272
aVand see the three star belt of Orion, the Hunter.
p273
aVAnd as an adult, I've been more aware
p274
aVof the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night.
p275
aVYou know, Orion facing the roaring bull.
p276
aVPerseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda.
p277
aVZeus battling Chronos for control of Mount Olympus.
p278
aVI mean, these are the great tales of the Greeks.
p279
aa(lp280
VAnd it caused me to wonder about our world today.
p281
aVAnd it caused me to wonder specifically,
p282
aVif we could make new constellations today,
p283
aVwhat would those look like? What would those be?
p284
aVIf we could make new pictures in the sky, what would we draw?
p285
aVWhat are the great stories of today?
p286
aa(lp287
VAnd those are the questions that inspired my new project,
p288
aVwhich is debuting here today at TED.
p289
aVNobody's seen this yet, publicly.
p290
aVIt's called Universe: Revealing Our Modern Mythology.
p291
aVAnd it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky.
p292
aVSo, it's my great pleasure now to show this to you.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo, Universe will open here.
p295
aVAnd you'll see that it leads with a shifting star field,
p296
aVand there's an Aurora Borealis in the background,
p297
aVkind of morphing with color. The color of the Aurora Borealis
p298
aVcan be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom,
p299
aVand we'll put it down here to red.
p300
aVSo you see this kind of \u2014 these stars moving along.
p301
aa(lp302
VNow, these aren't just little points of light, little pixels.
p303
aVEach of those stars actually represents
p304
aVa specific event in the real world \u2014
p305
aVa quote that was stated by somebody, an image,
p306
aVa news story, a person, a company. You know,
p307
aVsome kind of heroic personality.
p308
aVAnd you might notice that as the cursor begins
p309
aVto touch some of these stars, that shapes begin to emerge.
p310
aVWe see here there's a little man walking along, or maybe a woman.
p311
aVAnd we see here a photograph with a head.
p312
aVYou can start to see words emerging here.
p313
aVAnd those are
p314
aVthe constellations of today.
p315
aVAnd I can turn them all on,
p316
aVand you can see them moving across the sky now.
p317
aa(lp318
VThis is the universe of 2007, the last two months.
p319
aVThe data from this is global news coverage
p320
aVfrom thousands of news sources around the world.
p321
aVIt's using the API of a really great company that I work with
p322
aVin New York, actually, called Daylife.
p323
aVAnd it's kind of the zeitgeist view at this level
p324
aVof the world's current mythology over the last couple of months.
p325
aa(lp326
VSo we can see where it's emerging here, like President Ford,
p327
aVIraq, Bush. And we can actually isolate just the words \u2014
p328
aVI call them secrets \u2014 and we can cause them to form
p329
aVan alphabetical list. And we see Anna Nicole Smith
p330
aVplaying a big role recently.
p331
aVPresident Ford \u2014 this is Gerald Ford's funeral.
p332
aVWe can actually click anything in Universe
p333
aVand have it become the center of the universe,
p334
aVand everything else will enter its orbit.
p335
aVSo, we'll click Ford, and now that becomes the center.
p336
aVAnd the things that relate to Ford enter its orbit
p337
aVand swirl around it.
p338
aa(lp339
VWe can isolate just the photographs, and we now see those.
p340
aVWe can click on one of those
p341
aVand have the photograph be the center of the universe.
p342
aVNow the things that relate to it are swirling around.
p343
aVWe can click on this and we see this iconic image
p344
aVof Betty Ford kissing her husband's coffin.
p345
aa(lp346
VIn Universe, there's kind of no end. It just goes infinitely,
p347
aVand you can just kind of click on stuff.
p348
aVThis is a photographic representation, called Snapshots.
p349
aVBut we can actually be more specific in defining our universe.
p350
aVSo, if we want to,
p351
aVlet's check out what Bill Clinton's universe looks like.
p352
aVAnd let's see, in the past week, what he's been up to.
p353
aVSo now, we have a new universe, which is just constrained
p354
aVto all things Bill Clinton.
p355
aVWe can have his constellations emerge here.
p356
aVWe can pull out his secrets,
p357
aVand we see that it has a lot to do with candidates,
p358
aVHillary, presidential, Barack Obama.
p359
aVWe can see the stories
p360
aVthat Bill Clinton is taking part in right now.
p361
aVAny of those can be opened up.
p362
aVSo we see Obama and the Clintons meet in Alabama.
p363
aVYou can see that this is an important story;
p364
aVthere are a lot of things in its orbit. If we open this up,
p365
aVwe get different perspectives on this story.
p366
aVYou can click any of those to go out and read the article
p367
aVat the source. This one's from Al Jazeera.
p368
aa(lp369
VWe can also see the superstars. These would be the people
p370
aVthat are kind of the looming heroes and heroines
p371
aVin the universe of Bill Clinton. So there's Bill Clinton, Hillary,
p372
aVIraq, George Bush, Barack Obama, Scooter Libby \u2014
p373
aVthese are kind of the people of Bill Clinton.
p374
aVWe can also see a world map, so this shows us the geographic reach
p375
aVof Bill Clinton in the last week or so.
p376
aVWe can see he's been focused in America
p377
aVbecause he's been campaigning, probably,
p378
aVbut a little bit of action over here in the Middle East.
p379
aVAnd then we can also see a timeline.
p380
aVSo we see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday,
p381
aVbut he was back to work on Sunday morning,
p382
aVand actually been tapering off since then this week.
p383
aa(lp384
VAnd it's not limited to just people or dates,
p385
aVbut we can actually put in concepts also.
p386
aVSo if I put in climate change for all of 2006,
p387
aVwe'll see what that universe looks like.
p388
aVHere we have our star field. Here we have our shapes.
p389
aVHere we have our secrets.
p390
aVSo we see again, climate change is large:
p391
aVNairobi, global conference, environmental.
p392
aVAnd there are also quotes that you can see,
p393
aVif you're interested in reading about quotes on climate change.
p394
aVYou know, this is really an infinite thing.
p395
aa(lp396
VThe superstars of climate change in 2006:
p397
aVUnited States, Britain, China. You know,
p398
aVthese are the towering countries that kind of define this concept.
p399
aVSo this is a piece that demands exploration.
p400
aa(lp401
VThis will be online in several days, probably next Tuesday.
p402
aVAnd you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore
p403
aVwhat your own personal mythology might be.
p404
aVYou'll notice that in Daylife \u2014 rather, in Universe \u2014
p405
aVit supports both the notion of a global mythology,
p406
aVwhich is represented by something as broad as, say, 2007,
p407
aVand also a personal mythology.
p408
aVAs you search for the things that are important to you in your world,
p409
aVand then see what the constellations of those might look like.
p410
aa(lp411
VSo it's been a pleasure. Thank you very much.
