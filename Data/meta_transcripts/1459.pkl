VI know this is going to sound strange,
p4
aVbut I think robots can inspire us to be better humans.
p5
aVSee, I grew up in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
p6
aVthe home of Bethlehem Steel.
p7
aVMy father was an engineer,
p8
aVand when I was growing up, he would teach me how things worked.
p9
aVWe would build projects together,
p10
aVlike model rockets and slot cars.
p11
aVHere's the go-kart that we built together.
p12
aVThat's me behind the wheel,
p13
aVwith my sister and my best friend at the time.
p14
aVAnd one day,
p15
aVhe came home, when I was about 10 years old,
p16
aVand at the dinner table, he announced
p17
aVthat for our next project,  we were going to build ...
p18
aVa robot.
p19
aa(lp20
VA robot.
p21
aVNow, I was thrilled about this,
p22
aVbecause at school, there was a bully named Kevin,
p23
aVand he was picking on me,
p24
aVbecause I was the only Jewish kid in class.
p25
aVSo I couldn't wait to get started to work on this,
p26
aVso I could introduce Kevin to my robot.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
V(Robot noises)
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VBut that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind.
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VSee, he owned a chromium-plating company,
p39
aVand they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals.
p40
aVAnd so he needed an industrial robot like this,
p41
aVthat could basically do the heavy lifting.
p42
aa(lp43
VBut my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted, either.
p44
aVHe and I worked on it for several years,
p45
aVbut it was the 1970s, and the technology that was available to amateurs
p46
aVjust wasn't there yet.
p47
aVSo Dad continued to do this kind of work by hand.
p48
aVAnd a few years later,
p49
aVhe was diagnosed with cancer.
p50
aa(lp51
VYou see,
p52
aVwhat the robot we were trying to build was telling him
p53
aVwas not about doing the heavy lifting.
p54
aVIt was a warning
p55
aVabout his exposure to the toxic chemicals.
p56
aVHe didn't recognize that at the time,
p57
aVand he contracted leukemia.
p58
aVAnd he died at the age of 45.
p59
aVI was devastated by this.
p60
aVAnd I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build.
p61
aVWhen I was at college, I decided to study engineering, like him.
p62
aVAnd I went to Carnegie Mellon, and I earned my PhD in robotics.
p63
aVI've been studying robots ever since.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo what I'd like to tell you about are four robot projects,
p66
aVand how they've inspired me to be a better human.
p67
aVBy 1993, I was a young professor at USC,
p68
aVand I was just building up my own robotics lab,
p69
aVand this was the year the World Wide Web came out.
p70
aVAnd I remember my students were the ones who told me about it,
p71
aVand we would \u2014 we were just amazed.
p72
aVWe started playing with this, and that afternoon,
p73
aVwe realized that we could use this new, universal interface
p74
aVto allow anyone in the world to operate the robot in our lab.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo, rather than have it fight or do industrial work,
p77
aVwe decided to build a planter,
p78
aVput the robot into the center of it,
p79
aVand we called it the Telegarden.
p80
aVAnd we had put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the robot,
p81
aVand we wrote some special scripts and software,
p82
aVso that anyone in the world could come in,
p83
aVand by clicking on the screen,
p84
aVthey could move the robot around and visit the garden.
p85
aVBut we also set up some other software
p86
aVthat lets you participate and help us water the garden, remotely.
p87
aVAnd if you watered it a few times,
p88
aVwe'd give you your own seed to plant.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow, this was an engineering project,
p91
aVand we published some papers on the system design of it,
p92
aVbut we also thought of it as an art installation.
p93
aVIt was invited, after the first year,
p94
aVby the Ars Electronica Museum in Austria,
p95
aVto have it installed in their lobby.
p96
aVAnd I'm happy to say, it remained online there, 24 hours a day,
p97
aVfor almost nine years.
p98
aVThat robot was operated by more people
p99
aVthan any other robot in history.
p100
aa(lp101
VNow, one day,
p102
aVI got a call out of the blue from a student,
p103
aVwho asked a very simple but profound question.
p104
aVHe said, "Is the robot real?"
p105
aVNow, everyone else had assumed it was,
p106
aVand we knew it was, because we were working with it.
p107
aVBut I knew what he meant,
p108
aVbecause it would be possible
p109
aVto take a bunch of pictures of flowers in a garden
p110
aVand then, basically, index them in a computer system,
p111
aVsuch that it would appear that there was a real robot,
p112
aVwhen there wasn't.
p113
aVAnd the more I thought about it,
p114
aVI couldn't think of a good answer for how he could tell the difference.
p115
aa(lp116
VThis was right about the time that I was offered a position
p117
aVhere at Berkeley.
p118
aVAnd when I got here,
p119
aVI looked up Hubert Dreyfus,
p120
aVwho's a world-renowned professor of philosophy,
p121
aVAnd I talked with him about this and he said,
p122
aV"This is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy.
p123
aVIt goes back to the Skeptics and up through Descartes.
p124
aVIt's the issue of epistemology,
p125
aVthe study of how do we know that something is true."
p126
aa(lp127
VSo he and I started working together,
p128
aVand we coined a new term: "telepistemology,"
p129
aVthe study of knowledge at a distance.
p130
aVWe invited leading artists, engineers and philosophers
p131
aVto write essays about this,
p132
aVand the results are collected in this book from MIT Press.
p133
aVSo thanks to this student,
p134
aVwho questioned what everyone else had assumed to be true,
p135
aVthis project taught me an important lesson about life,
p136
aVwhich is to always question assumptions.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow, the second project I'll tell you about
p139
aVgrew out of the Telegarden.
p140
aVAs it was operating, my students and I were very interested
p141
aVin how people were interacting with each other,
p142
aVand what they were doing with the garden.
p143
aVSo we started thinking:
p144
aVwhat if the robot could leave the garden
p145
aVand go out into some other interesting environment?
p146
aVLike, for example, what if it could go to a dinner party
p147
aVat the White House?
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VSo, because we were interested more in the system design
p152
aVand the user interface than in the hardware,
p153
aVwe decided that,
p154
aVrather than have a robot replace the human to go to the party,
p155
aVwe'd have a human replace the robot.
p156
aVWe called it the Tele-Actor.
p157
aa(lp158
VWe got a human,
p159
aVsomeone who's very outgoing and gregarious,
p160
aVand she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment,
p161
aVcameras and microphones,
p162
aVand then a backpack with wireless Internet connection.
p163
aVAnd the idea was that she could go
p164
aVinto a remote and interesting environment,
p165
aVand then over the Internet,
p166
aVpeople could experience what she was experiencing.
p167
aVSo they could see what she was seeing,
p168
aVbut then, more importantly, they could participate,
p169
aVby interacting with each other and coming up with ideas
p170
aVabout what she should do next and where she should go,
p171
aVand then conveying those to the Tele-Actor.
p172
aVSo we got a chance to take the Tele-Actor
p173
aVto the Webby Awards in San Francisco.
p174
aVAnd that year, Sam Donaldson was the host.
p175
aVJust before the curtain went up, I had about 30 seconds
p176
aVto explain to Mr. Donaldson what we were going to do.
p177
aVAnd I said, "The Tele-Actor is going to be joining you onstage.
p178
aVThis is a new experimental project,
p179
aVand people are watching her on their screens,
p180
aVthere's cameras involved and there's microphones
p181
aVand she's got an earbud in her ear,
p182
aVand people over the network are giving her advice
p183
aVabout what to do next."
p184
aVAnd he said, "Wait a second.
p185
aVThat's what I do."
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VSo he loved the concept,
p190
aVand when the Tele-Actor walked onstage, she walked right up to him,
p191
aVand she gave him a big kiss right on the lips.
p192
aa(lp193
V(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VWe were totally surprised \u2014 we had no idea that would happen.
p196
aVAnd he was great, he just gave her a big hug in return,
p197
aVand it worked out great.
p198
aVBut that night, as we were packing up,
p199
aVI asked the Tele-Actor, how did the Tele-Directors decide
p200
aVthat they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson?
p201
aVAnd she said they hadn't.
p202
aVShe said, when she was just about to walk onstage,
p203
aVthe Tele-Directors still were trying to agree on what to do,
p204
aVand so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Laughter)
p207
aa(lp208
VSo, the success of the Tele-Actor that night
p209
aVwas due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor.
p210
aVShe knew when to trust her instincts.
p211
aVAnd so that project taught me another lesson about life,
p212
aVwhich is that, when in doubt, improvise.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VNow, the third project grew out of my experience
p217
aVwhen my father was in the hospital.
p218
aVHe was undergoing a treatment \u2014 chemotherapy treatments \u2014
p219
aVand there's a related treatment called brachytherapy,
p220
aVwhere tiny, radioactive seeds are placed into the body
p221
aVto treat cancerous tumors.
p222
aVAnd the way it's done, as you can see here,
p223
aVis that surgeons insert needles into the body
p224
aVto deliver the seeds.
p225
aVAnd all these needles are inserted in parallel.
p226
aVSo it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs.
p227
aVAnd as a result, the needles damage these organs, cause damage,
p228
aVwhich leads to trauma and side effects.
p229
aVSo my students and I wondered:
p230
aVwhat if we could modify the system,
p231
aVso that the needles could come in at different angles?
p232
aa(lp233
VSo we simulated this;
p234
aVwe developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this.
p235
aVAnd we were able to show
p236
aVthat we are able to avoid the delicate organs,
p237
aVand yet still achieve the coverage of the tumors with the radiation.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo now, we're working with doctors at UCSF
p240
aVand engineers at Johns Hopkins,
p241
aVand we're building a robot that has a number of \u2014
p242
aVit's a specialized design with different joints
p243
aVthat can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles.
p244
aVAnd as you can see here, they can avoid delicate organs
p245
aVand still reach the targets they're aiming for.
p246
aVSo, by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel,
p247
aVthis project also taught me an important lesson:
p248
aVWhen in doubt, when your path is blocked, pivot.
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd the last project also has to do with medical robotics.
p251
aVAnd this is something that's grown out of a system
p252
aVcalled the da Vinci surgical robot.
p253
aVAnd this is a commercially available device.
p254
aVIt's being used in over 2,000 hospitals around the world.
p255
aVThe idea is it allows the surgeon to operate comfortably
p256
aVin his own coordinate frame.
p257
aVMany of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious, like suturing,
p258
aVand currently, all of these are performed
p259
aVunder the specific and immediate control of the surgeon.
p260
aVSo the surgeon becomes fatigued over time.
p261
aVAnd we've been wondering,
p262
aVwhat if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks,
p263
aVand thereby free the surgeon
p264
aVto focus on the more complicated parts of the surgery,
p265
aVand also cut down on the time that the surgery would take
p266
aVif we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster?
p267
aa(lp268
VNow, it's hard to program a robot to do delicate things like this.
p269
aVBut it turns out my colleague Pieter Abbeel, who's here at Berkeley,
p270
aVhas developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example.
p271
aVSo he's gotten robots to fly helicopters,
p272
aVdo incredibly interesting, beautiful acrobatics,
p273
aVby watching human experts fly them.
p274
aVSo we got one of these robots.
p275
aVWe started working with Pieter and his students.
p276
aVAnd we asked a surgeon to perform a task \u2014
p277
aVwith the robot.
p278
aVSo what we're doing is asking the surgeon to perform the task,
p279
aVand we record the motions of the robot.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo here's an example.
p282
aVI'll use tracing out a figure eight as an example.
p283
aVSo here's what it looks like when the robot \u2014
p284
aVthis is what the robot's path looks like, those three examples.
p285
aVNow, those are much better than what a novice like me could do,
p286
aVbut they're still jerky and imprecise.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo we record all these examples, the data,
p289
aVand then go through a sequence of steps.
p290
aVFirst, we use a technique called dynamic time warping
p291
aVfrom speech recognition.
p292
aVAnd this allows us to temporally align all of the examples.
p293
aVAnd then we apply Kalman filtering, a technique from control theory,
p294
aVthat allows us to statistically analyze all the noise
p295
aVand extract the desired trajectory that underlies them.
p296
aVNow we take those human demonstrations \u2014
p297
aVthey're all noisy and imperfect \u2014
p298
aVand we extract from them an inferred task trajectory
p299
aVand control sequence for the robot.
p300
aVWe then execute that on the robot,
p301
aVwe observe what happens,
p302
aVthen we adjust the controls,
p303
aVusing a sequence of techniques called iterative learning.
p304
aVThen what we do is we increase the velocity a little bit.
p305
aVWe observe the results, adjust the controls again,
p306
aVand observe what happens.
p307
aVAnd we go through this several rounds.
p308
aa(lp309
VAnd here's the result.
p310
aVThat's the inferred task trajectory,
p311
aVand here's the robot moving at the speed of the human.
p312
aVHere's four times the speed of the human.
p313
aVHere's seven times.
p314
aVAnd here's the robot operating at 10 times the speed of the human.
p315
aVSo we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task
p316
aVlike a surgical subtask,
p317
aVat 10 times the speed of a human.
p318
aVSo this project also,
p319
aVbecause of its involved practicing and learning,
p320
aVdoing something over and over again,
p321
aVthis project also has a lesson, which is:
p322
aVif you want to do something well,
p323
aVthere's no substitute for practice, practice, practice.
p324
aa(lp325
VSo these are four of the lessons that I've learned from robots
p326
aVover the years.
p327
aVAnd the field of robotics has gotten much better over time.
p328
aVNowadays, high school students can build robots,
p329
aVlike the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build.
p330
aa(lp331
VBut, it's very \u2014 now ...
p332
aVAnd now, I have a daughter,
p333
aVnamed Odessa.
p334
aVShe's eight years old.
p335
aVAnd she likes robots, too.
p336
aVMaybe it runs in the family.
p337
aa(lp338
V(Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
VI wish she could meet my dad.
p341
aVAnd now I get to teach her how things work,
p342
aVand we get to build projects together.
p343
aVAnd I wonder what kind of lessons she'll learn from them.
p344
aa(lp345
VRobots are the most human of our machines.
p346
aVThey can't solve all of the world's problems,
p347
aVbut I think they have something important to teach us.
p348
aVI invite all of you
p349
aVto think about the innovations that you're interested in,
p350
aVthe machines that you wish for.
p351
aVAnd think about what they might be telling you.
p352
aVBecause I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations,
p353
aVthe devices we dream about,
p354
aVcan inspire us to be better humans.
p355
aa(lp356
VThank you.
