VGrowing up in Kenya,
p4
aVI knew I always wanted to study biochemistry.
p5
aVSee, I had seen the impact of the high prevalence of diseases like malaria,
p6
aVand I wanted to make medicines that would cure the sick.
p7
aVSo I worked really hard,
p8
aVgot a scholarship to the United States, where I became a cancer researcher,
p9
aVand I loved it.
p10
aVFor someone who wants to cure diseases,
p11
aVthere is no higher calling.
p12
aa(lp13
VTen years later, I returned to Kenya to do just that.
p14
aVA freshly minted PhD,
p15
aVready to take on this horrific illness,
p16
aVwhich in Kenya was almost certainly a death sentence.
p17
aVBut instead of landing a job in a pharmaceutical company
p18
aVor a hospital,
p19
aVI found myself drawn to a different kind of lab,
p20
aVworking with a different kind of patient \u2014
p21
aVa patient whose illness was so serious
p22
aVit impacted every single person in my country;
p23
aVa patient who needed to get healthy fast.
p24
aVThat patient was my government.
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
VSee, many of us will agree that lots of governments are unhealthy today.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
V(Applause)
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd Kenya was no exception.
p35
aVWhen I returned to Kenya in 2014,
p36
aVthere was 17 percent youth unemployment.
p37
aVAnd Nairobi, the major business hub,
p38
aVwas rated 177th on the quality of living index.
p39
aVIt was bad.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow, an economy is only as healthy as the entities that make it up.
p42
aVSo when government \u2014
p43
aVone of its most vital entities \u2014
p44
aVis weak or unhealthy,
p45
aVeveryone and everything suffers.
p46
aVSometimes you might put a Band-Aid in place
p47
aVto try and temporarily stop the pain.
p48
aVMaybe some of you here have participated
p49
aVin a Band-Aid operation to an African country \u2014
p50
aVsetting up alternative schools, building hospitals, digging wells \u2014
p51
aVbecause governments there either weren't or couldn't provide
p52
aVthe services to their citizens.
p53
aa(lp54
VWe all know this is a temporary solution.
p55
aVThere are just some things Band-Aids can't fix,
p56
aVlike providing an environment where businesses feel secure
p57
aVthat they'll have an equal opportunity
p58
aVto be able to run and start their businesses successfully.
p59
aVOr there are systems in place
p60
aVthat would protect the private property that they create.
p61
aVI would argue,
p62
aVonly government is capable of creating these necessary conditions
p63
aVfor economies to thrive.
p64
aa(lp65
VEconomies thrive when business are able to quickly and easily set up shop.
p66
aVBusiness owners create new sources of income for themselves,
p67
aVnew jobs get added into the economy
p68
aVand then more taxes are paid to fund public projects.
p69
aVNew business is good for everyone.
p70
aVAnd it's such an important measure of economic growth,
p71
aVthe World Bank has a ranking called the "Ease of Doing Business Ranking,"
p72
aVwhich measures how easy or difficult it is to start a business
p73
aVin any given country.
p74
aVAnd as you can imagine,
p75
aVstarting or running a business in a country with an ailing government \u2014
p76
aValmost impossible.
p77
aa(lp78
VThe President of Kenya knew this, which is why in 2014,
p79
aVhe came to our lab and asked us to partner with him
p80
aVto be able to help Kenya to jump-start business growth.
p81
aVHe set an ambitious goal:
p82
aVhe wanted Kenya to be ranked top 50 in this World Bank ranking.
p83
aVIn 2014 when he came,
p84
aVKenya was ranked 136 out of 189 countries.
p85
aVWe had our work cut out for us.
p86
aa(lp87
VFortunately, he came to the right place.
p88
aVWe're not just a Band-Aid kind of team.
p89
aVWe're a group of computer scientists, mathematicians, engineers
p90
aVand a cancer researcher,
p91
aVwho understood that in order to cure the sickness
p92
aVof a system as big as government,
p93
aVwe needed to examine the whole body,
p94
aVand then we needed to drill down all the way from the organs,
p95
aVinto the tissues,
p96
aVall the way to single cells,
p97
aVso that we could properly make a diagnosis.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo with our marching orders from the President himself,
p100
aVwe embarked on the purest of the scientific method:
p101
aVcollecting data \u2014
p102
aVall the data we could get our hands on \u2014
p103
aVmaking hypotheses,
p104
aVcreating solutions,
p105
aVone after the other.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo we met with hundreds of individuals who worked at government agencies,
p108
aVfrom the tax agency, the lands office, utilities company,
p109
aVthe agency that's responsible for registering companies,
p110
aVand with each of them, we observed them as they served customers,
p111
aVwe documented their processes \u2014 most of them were manual.
p112
aVWe also just went back and looked at a lot of their previous paperwork
p113
aVto try and really understand;
p114
aVto try and diagnose what bodily malfunctions had occurred
p115
aVthat lead to that 136th spot on the World Bank list.
p116
aa(lp117
VWhat did we find?
p118
aVWell, in Kenya it was taking 72 days
p119
aVfor a business owner to register their property,
p120
aVcompared to just one day in New Zealand,
p121
aVwhich was ranked second on the World Bank list.
p122
aVIt took 158 days to get a new electric connection.
p123
aVIn Korea it took 18 days.
p124
aVIf you wanted to get a construction permit
p125
aVso you could put up a building,
p126
aVin Kenya, it was going to take you 125 days.
p127
aVIn Singapore, which is ranked first, that would only take you 26 days.
p128
aVGod forbid you had to go to court
p129
aVto get help in being able to settle a dispute to enforce a contract,
p130
aVbecause that process alone would take you 465 days.
p131
aVAnd if that wasn't bad enough,
p132
aVyou would lose 40 percent of your claim in just fees \u2014
p133
aVlegal fees, enforcement fees, court fees.
p134
aa(lp135
VNow, I know what you're thinking:
p136
aVfor there to exist such inefficiencies in an African country,
p137
aVthere must be corruption.
p138
aVThe very cells that run the show must be corrupt to the bone.
p139
aVI thought so, too, actually.
p140
aVWhen we started out,
p141
aVI thought I was going to find so much corruption,
p142
aVI was literally going to either die or get killed in the process.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VBut when we dug deeper,
p147
aVwe didn't find corruption in the classic sense:
p148
aVslimy gangsters lurking in the darkness,
p149
aVwaiting to grease the palms of their friends.
p150
aVWhat we found was an overwhelming sense of helplessness.
p151
aVOur government was sick,
p152
aVbecause government employees felt helpless.
p153
aVThey felt that they were not empowered to drive change.
p154
aVAnd when people feel stuck and helpless,
p155
aVthey stop seeing their role in a bigger system.
p156
aVThey start to think the work they do doesn't matter in driving change.
p157
aVAnd when that happens,
p158
aVthings slow down,
p159
aVfall through the cracks
p160
aVand inefficiencies flourish.
p161
aa(lp162
VNow imagine with me,
p163
aVif you had a process you had to go through \u2014
p164
aVhad no other alternative \u2014
p165
aVand this process was inefficient, complex
p166
aVand very, very slow.
p167
aVWhat would you do?
p168
aVI think you might start by trying to find somebody to outsource it to,
p169
aVso that they can just take care of that for you.
p170
aVIf that doesn't work,
p171
aVmaybe you'd consider paying somebody
p172
aVto just "unofficially" take care of it on your behalf \u2014
p173
aVespecially if you thought nobody was going to catch you.
p174
aVNot out of malice or greed,
p175
aVjust trying to make sure that you get something to work for you
p176
aVso you can move on.
p177
aVUnfortunately, that is the beginning of corruption.
p178
aVAnd if left to thrive and grow,
p179
aVit seeps into the whole system,
p180
aVand before you know it,
p181
aVthe whole body is sick.
p182
aa(lp183
VKnowing this,
p184
aVwe had to start by making sure
p185
aVthat every single stakeholder we worked with had a shared vision
p186
aVfor what we wanted to do.
p187
aVSo we met with everyone,
p188
aVfrom the clerk whose sole job is to remove staples
p189
aVfrom application packets,
p190
aVto the legal drafters at the attorney general's office,
p191
aVto the clerks who are responsible for serving business owners
p192
aVwhen they came to access government services.
p193
aVAnd with them,
p194
aVwe made sure that they understood
p195
aVhow their day-to-day actions were impacting our ability as a country
p196
aVto create new jobs and to attract investments.
p197
aVNo one's role was too small; everyone's role was vital.
p198
aa(lp199
VNow, guess what we started to see?
p200
aVA coalition of government employees
p201
aVwho are excited and ready to drive change,
p202
aVbegan to grow and form.
p203
aVAnd together we started to implement changes
p204
aVthat impacted the service delivery of our country.
p205
aa(lp206
VThe result?
p207
aVIn just two years,
p208
aVKenya's ranking moved from 136 to 92.
p209
aa(lp210
V(Applause)
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd in recognition of the significant reforms we've been able to implement
p213
aVin such a short time,
p214
aVKenya was recognized
p215
aVto be among the top three global reformers in the world
p216
aVtwo years in a row.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Applause)
p219
aa(lp220
VAre we fully healthy?
p221
aVNo.
p222
aVWe have some serious work still to do.
p223
aVI like to think about these two years like a weight-loss program.
p224
aa(lp225
V(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VIt's that time after months of hard, grueling work at the gym,
p228
aVand then you get your first time to weigh yourself,
p229
aVand you've lost 20 pounds.
p230
aVYou're feeling unstoppable.
p231
aa(lp232
VNow, some of you may think this doesn't apply to you.
p233
aVYou're not from Kenya.
p234
aVYou don't intend to be an entrepreneur.
p235
aVBut think with me for just a moment.
p236
aVWhen is the last time you accessed a government service?
p237
aVMaybe applied for your driver's license,
p238
aVtried to do your taxes on your own.
p239
aVIt's easy in this political and global economy
p240
aVto want to give up when we think about transforming government.
p241
aVWe can easily resign to the fact or to the thinking
p242
aVthat government is too inefficient,
p243
aVtoo corrupt,
p244
aVunfixable.
p245
aVWe might even rarely get some key government responsibilities
p246
aVto other sectors,
p247
aVto Band-Aid solutions,
p248
aVor to just give up and feel helpless.
p249
aVBut just because a system is sick doesn't mean it's dying.
p250
aVWe cannot afford to give up
p251
aVwhen it comes to the challenges of fixing our governments.
p252
aa(lp253
VIn the end,
p254
aVwhat really makes a government healthy is when healthy cells \u2014
p255
aVthat's you and I \u2014
p256
aVget to the ground,
p257
aVroll up our sleeves,
p258
aVrefuse to be helpless
p259
aVand believe that sometimes,
p260
aVall it takes is for us to create some space
p261
aVfor healthy cells to grow and thrive.
p262
aa(lp263
VThank you.
