VRunning: it's basically just right, left, right, left, yeah?
p4
aVI mean, we've been doing it for two million years,
p5
aVso it's kind of arrogant to assume that I've got something to say
p6
aVthat hasn't been said and performed better a long time ago.
p7
aVBut the cool thing about running, as I've discovered,
p8
aVis that something bizarre happens in this activity all the time.
p9
aVCase in point: A couple months ago, if you saw the New York City Marathon,
p10
aVI guarantee you, you saw something that no one has ever seen before.
p11
aa(lp12
VAn Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu turns up at the starting line.
p13
aVShe's 37 years old.
p14
aVShe hasn't won a marathon of any kind in eight years,
p15
aVand a few months previously,
p16
aVshe had almost died in childbirth.
p17
aVDerartu Tulu was ready to hang it up and retire from the sport,
p18
aVbut she decided she'd go for broke
p19
aVand try for one last big payday in the marquee event,
p20
aVthe New York City Marathon.
p21
aVExcept \u2014 bad news for Derartu Tulu \u2014 some other people had the same idea,
p22
aVincluding the Olympic gold medalist,
p23
aVand Paula Radcliffe, who is a monster,
p24
aVthe fastest woman marathoner in history by far.
p25
aVOnly 10 minutes off the men's world record,
p26
aVPaula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable.
p27
aVThat's her competition.
p28
aa(lp29
VThe gun goes off, and \u2014 I mean, she's not even an underdog;
p30
aVshe's, like, under the underdogs.
p31
aVBut the under-underdog hangs tough,
p32
aVand 22 miles into a 26-mile race,
p33
aVthere is Derartu Tulu, up there with the lead pack.
p34
aVNow, this is when something really bizarre happens.
p35
aVPaula Radcliffe, the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck
p36
aVfrom Derartu Tulu's under-underdog hands,
p37
aVsuddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back.
p38
aVSo we all know what to do in this situation, right?
p39
aVYou give her a quick crack in the teeth with your elbow
p40
aVand blaze for the finish line.
p41
aVDerartu Tulu ruins the script.
p42
aVInstead of taking off,
p43
aVshe falls back and she grabs Paula Radcliffe,
p44
aVand says, "Come on. Come with us. You can do it."
p45
aVSo Paula Radcliffe, unfortunately, does it.
p46
aVShe catches up with the lead pack
p47
aVand is pushing toward the finish line.
p48
aVBut then she falls back again.
p49
aVThe second time, Derartu Tulu grabs her and tries to pull her.
p50
aVAnd Paula Radcliffe, at that point, says, "I'm done. Go."
p51
aVSo that's a fantastic story, and we all know how it ends.
p52
aVShe loses the check,
p53
aVbut she goes home with something bigger and more important.
p54
aVExcept Derartu Tulu ruins the script again.
p55
aVInstead of losing, she blazes past the lead pack and wins.
p56
aVWins the New York City Marathon,
p57
aVgoes home with a big fat check.
p58
aa(lp59
VIt's a heartwarming story,
p60
aVbut if you drill a little bit deeper,
p61
aVyou've got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there.
p62
aVWhen you have two outliers in one organism,
p63
aVit's not a coincidence.
p64
aVWhen you have someone who is more competitive and more compassionate
p65
aVthan anybody else in the race, again, it's not a coincidence.
p66
aVYou show me a creature with webbed feet and gills;
p67
aVsomehow water's involved.
p68
aa(lp69
VSomeone with that kind of heart, there's some kind of connection there.
p70
aVAnd the answer to it, I think, can be found
p71
aVdown in the Copper Canyons of Mexico,
p72
aVwhere there's a reclusive tribe, called the Tarahumara Indians.
p73
aVNow, the Tarahumara are remarkable for three things.
p74
aVNumber one is:
p75
aVthey have been living essentially unchanged for the past 400 years.
p76
aVWhen the conquistadors arrived in North America you had two choices:
p77
aVyou either fight back and engage or you could take off.
p78
aVThe Mayans and Aztecs engaged,
p79
aVwhich is why there are very few Mayans and Aztecs.
p80
aVThe Tarahumara had a different strategy.
p81
aVThey took off and hid
p82
aVin this labyrinthine, networking, spider-webbing system of canyons
p83
aVcalled the Copper Canyons.
p84
aVAnd there they've remained since the 1600s,
p85
aVessentially the same way they've always been.
p86
aa(lp87
VThe second thing remarkable about the Tarahumara is:
p88
aVdeep into old age \u2014 70 to 80 years old \u2014
p89
aVthese guys aren't running marathons;
p90
aVthey're running mega-marathons.
p91
aVThey're not doing 26 miles,
p92
aVthey're doing 100, 150 miles at a time,
p93
aVand apparently without injury, without problems.
p94
aa(lp95
VThe last thing that's remarkable about the Tarahumara is:
p96
aVall the things we're going to be talking about today,
p97
aVall the things we're trying to use all of our technology
p98
aVand brain power to solve \u2014
p99
aVthings like heart disease and cholesterol and cancer;
p100
aVcrime, warfare and violence; clinical depression \u2014 all this stuff \u2014
p101
aVthe Tarahumara don't know what you're talking about.
p102
aVThey are free from all of these modern ailments.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo what's the connection?
p105
aVAgain, we're talking about outliers;
p106
aVthere's got to be some kind of cause and effect.
p107
aVWell, there are teams of scientists at Harvard and the University of Utah
p108
aVthat are bending their brains and trying to figure out
p109
aVwhat the Tarahumara have known forever.
p110
aVThey're trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries.
p111
aVAnd once again, a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery \u2014
p112
aVperhaps the key to Derartu Tulu and the Tarahumara
p113
aVis wrapped in three other mysteries, which go like this:
p114
aVThree things \u2014 if you have the answer, come up and take the microphone,
p115
aVbecause nobody else knows the answer.
p116
aVIf you know it, you're smarter than anybody on planet Earth.
p117
aa(lp118
VMystery number one is this:
p119
aVTwo million years ago, the human brain exploded in size.
p120
aVAustralopithecus had a tiny little pea brain.
p121
aVSuddenly humans show up, Homo erectus, big old melon head.
p122
aVTo have a brain of that size,
p123
aVyou need to have a source of condensed caloric energy.
p124
aVIn other words, early humans are eating dead animals \u2014
p125
aVno argument, that's a fact.
p126
aVThe only problem is,
p127
aVthe first edged weapons only appeared about 200,000 years ago.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo somehow, for nearly two million years,
p130
aVwe are killing animals without any weapons.
p131
aVNow, we're not using our strength,
p132
aVbecause we are the biggest sissies in the jungle.
p133
aVEvery other animal is stronger than we are,
p134
aVthey have fangs, they have claws, they have nimbleness, they have speed.
p135
aVWe think Usain Bolt is fast.
p136
aVUsain Bolt can get his ass kicked by a squirrel.
p137
aVWe're not fast.
p138
aVThat would be an Olympic event:
p139
aVturn a squirrel loose, whoever catches it gets a gold medal.
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VSo no weapons, no speed, no strength, no fangs, no claws.
p144
aVHow were we killing these animals? Mystery number one.
p145
aa(lp146
VMystery number two:
p147
aVWomen have been in the Olympics for quite some time now,
p148
aVbut one thing that's remarkable about all women sprinters:
p149
aVthey all suck; they're terrible.
p150
aVThere's not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been.
p151
aVThe fastest woman to ever run a mile did it in 4:15.
p152
aVI could throw a rock and hit a high-school boy
p153
aVwho can run faster than 4:15.
p154
aVFor some reason, you guys are just really slow.
p155
aVBut \u2014
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VBut, you get to the marathon we were just talking about \u2014
p160
aVyou've only been allowed to run the marathon for 20 years,
p161
aVbecause prior to the 1980s, medical science said
p162
aVif a woman tried to run 26 miles \u2014 does anyone know what would happen
p163
aVif you tried to run 26 miles?
p164
aVWhy you were banned from the marathon before the 1980s?
p165
aa(lp166
VAudience Member: Her uterus would be torn.
p167
aa(lp168
VChristopher McDougall: Her uterus would be torn, yes.
p169
aVTorn reproductive organs.
p170
aVThe uterus would literally fall out of the body.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VNow, I've been to a lot of marathons,
p175
aVand I've yet to see any ...
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VSo it's only been 20 years
p180
aVthat women have been allowed to run the marathon.
p181
aVIn that very short learning curve, you've gone from broken organs
p182
aVup to the fact that you're only 10 minutes off the male world record.
p183
aa(lp184
VThen you go beyond 26 miles, into the distance
p185
aVthat medical science also told us would be fatal to humans \u2014
p186
aVremember Pheidippides died when he ran 26 miles \u2014
p187
aVyou get to 50 and 100 miles, and suddenly, it's a different game.
p188
aVYou take a runner like Ann Trason or Nikki Kimball or Jenn Shelton,
p189
aVput them in a race of 50 or 100 miles against anybody in the world,
p190
aVand it's a coin toss who's going to win.
p191
aVI'll give you an example.
p192
aVA couple years ago, Emily Baer signed up for a race
p193
aVcalled the Hardrock 100,
p194
aVwhich tells you all you need to know about the race.
p195
aVThey give you 48 hours to finish this race.
p196
aVWell, Emily Baer \u2014 500 runners \u2014
p197
aVshe finishes in eighth place, in the top 10,
p198
aVeven though she stopped at all the aid stations
p199
aVto breastfeed her baby during the race.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd yet, she beat 492 other people.
p204
aVThe last mystery:
p205
aVWhy is it that women get stronger as distances get longer?
p206
aVThe third mystery is this:
p207
aVAt the University of Utah, they started tracking finishing times
p208
aVfor people running the marathon.
p209
aVWhat they found is that if you start running the marathon at age 19,
p210
aVyou'll get progressively faster, year by year,
p211
aVuntil you reach your peak at age 27.
p212
aVAnd then after that, you succumb to the rigors of time.
p213
aVAnd you'll get slower and slower,
p214
aVuntil eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age 19.
p215
aVSo about seven, eight years to reach your peak,
p216
aVand then gradually you fall off your peak,
p217
aVuntil you go back to the starting point.
p218
aVYou'd think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed,
p219
aVmaybe 10 years \u2014 no, it's 45 years.
p220
aV64-year-old men and women
p221
aVare running as fast as they were at age 19.
p222
aVNow, I defy you to come up with any other physical activity \u2014
p223
aVand please don't say golf \u2014 something that's actually hard \u2014
p224
aa(lp225
V(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
Vwhere geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo you have these three mysteries.
p230
aVIs there one piece in the puzzle which might wrap all these things up?
p231
aVYou've got to be careful anytime someone looks back in prehistory
p232
aVand tries to give you a global answer because,
p233
aVit being prehistory, you can say whatever the hell you want
p234
aVand get away with it.
p235
aVBut I'll submit this to you:
p236
aVIf you put one piece in the middle of this jigsaw puzzle,
p237
aVsuddenly it all starts to form a coherent picture.
p238
aVIf you're wondering why the Tarahumara don't fight
p239
aVand don't die of heart disease,
p240
aVwhy a poor Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu
p241
aVcan be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive,
p242
aVand why we somehow were able to find food without weapons,
p243
aVperhaps it's because humans,
p244
aVas much as we like to think of ourselves as masters of the universe,
p245
aVactually evolved as nothing more than a pack of hunting dogs.
p246
aa(lp247
VMaybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal.
p248
aVBecause the one advantage we have in the wilderness \u2014
p249
aVagain, it's not our fangs, our claws or our speed \u2014
p250
aVthe only thing we do really well is sweat.
p251
aVWe're really good at being sweaty and smelly.
p252
aVBetter than any other mammal on Earth, we can sweat really well.
p253
aVBut the advantage of that little bit of social discomfort
p254
aVis the fact that, when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances,
p255
aVwe're superb \u2014 the best on the planet.
p256
aVYou take a horse on a hot day,
p257
aVand after about five or six miles, that horse has a choice:
p258
aVit's either going to breathe or it's going to cool off.
p259
aVBut it ain't doing both. We can.
p260
aVSo what if we evolved as hunting pack animals?
p261
aVWhat if the only natural advantage we had in the world
p262
aVwas the fact that we could get together as a group,
p263
aVgo out there on that African savanna, pick out an antelope,
p264
aVgo out as a pack, and run that thing to death?
p265
aVThat's all we could do.
p266
aVWe could run really far on a hot day.
p267
aa(lp268
VWell, if that's true, a couple other things had to be true as well.
p269
aVThe key to being part of a hunting pack is the word "pack."
p270
aVIf you go out by yourself and try to chase an antelope,
p271
aVI guarantee there will be two cadavers out in the savanna.
p272
aVYou need a pack to pull together.
p273
aVYou need to have those 64- and 65-year-olds
p274
aVwho have been doing this for a long time
p275
aVto understand which antelope you're trying to catch.
p276
aVThe herd explodes and it gathers back again.
p277
aVThose expert trackers have to be part of the pack.
p278
aVThey can't be 10 miles behind.
p279
aVYou need the women and the adolescents there,
p280
aVbecause the two times in your life you most benefit from animal protein
p281
aVis when you're a nursing mother and a developing adolescent.
p282
aVIt makes no sense to have the antelope over there, dead,
p283
aVand the people who want to eat it 50 miles away.
p284
aVThey need to be part of the pack.
p285
aVYou need those 27-year-old studs at the peak of their powers
p286
aVready to drop the kill,
p287
aVand you need those teenagers who are learning the whole thing involved.
p288
aVThe pack stays together.
p289
aa(lp290
VAnother thing that has to be true: this pack cannot be materialistic.
p291
aVYou can't be hauling all your crap around, trying to chase the antelope.
p292
aVYou can't be a pissed-off pack.
p293
aVYou can't be bearing grudges, like, "I'm not chasing that guy's antelope.
p294
aVHe pissed me off. Let him go chase his own antelope."
p295
aVThe pack has got to be able to swallow its ego,
p296
aVbe cooperative, and pull together.
p297
aVWhat you end up with, in other words,
p298
aVis a culture remarkably similar to the Tarahumara,
p299
aVa tribe that has remained unchanged since the Stone Age.
p300
aVIt's a really compelling argument
p301
aVthat maybe the Tarahumara are doing exactly what all of us had done
p302
aVfor two million years,
p303
aVthat it's us in modern times who have sort of gone off the path.
p304
aa(lp305
VYou know, we look at running as this kind of alien, foreign thing,
p306
aVthis punishment you've got to do because you ate pizza the night before.
p307
aVBut maybe it's something different.
p308
aVMaybe we're the ones who have taken this natural advantage we had
p309
aVand we spoiled it.
p310
aVHow do we spoil it? Well, how do we spoil anything?
p311
aVWe try to cash in on it. Right?
p312
aVWe try to can it and package it and make it "better"
p313
aVand then sell it to people.
p314
aVAnd then what happened was, we started creating
p315
aVthese fancy cushioned things which can make running "better,"
p316
aVcalled running shoes.
p317
aa(lp318
VThe reason I get personally pissed-off about running shoes
p319
aVis because I bought a million of them and I kept getting hurt.
p320
aVAnd I think if anybody in here runs \u2014
p321
aVI just had a conversation with Carol.
p322
aVWe talked for two minutes backstage, and she talked about plantar fasciitis.
p323
aVYou talk to a runner, I guarantee within 30 seconds,
p324
aVthe conversation turns to injury.
p325
aVSo if humans evolved as runners, if that's our one natural advantage,
p326
aVthen why are we so bad at it?
p327
aVWhy do we keep getting hurt?
p328
aa(lp329
VA curious thing about running and running injuries
p330
aVis that the running injury is new to our time.
p331
aVIf you read folklore and mythology,
p332
aVany kind of myths, any kind of tall tales,
p333
aVrunning is always associated with freedom and vitality
p334
aVand youthfulness and eternal vigor.
p335
aVIt's only in our lifetime that running has become associated
p336
aVwith fear and pain.
p337
aVGeronimo used to say, "My only friends are my legs. I only trust my legs."
p338
aVThat's because an Apache triathlon used to be you'd run 50 miles
p339
aVacross the desert,
p340
aVengage in hand-to-hand combat, steal a bunch of horses,
p341
aVand slap leather for home.
p342
aVGeronimo was never saying, "You know something, my Achilles \u2014 I'm tapering.
p343
aVI've got to take this week off."
p344
aVOr, "I need to cross-train. I didn't do yoga. I'm not ready."
p345
aa(lp346
V(Laughter)
p347
aa(lp348
VHumans ran and ran all the time.
p349
aVWe are here today. We have our digital technology.
p350
aVAll of our science comes from the fact
p351
aVthat our ancestors were able to do something extraordinary every day,
p352
aVwhich was just rely on their naked feet and legs
p353
aVto run long distances.
p354
aa(lp355
VSo how do we get back to that again?
p356
aVWell, I would submit to you the first thing is:
p357
aVget rid of all packaging, all the sales, all the marketing.
p358
aVGet rid of all the stinking running shoes.
p359
aVStop focusing on urban marathons,
p360
aVwhich, if you do four hours, you suck,
p361
aVand if you do 3:59:59, you're awesome,
p362
aVbecause you qualified for another race.
p363
aVWe need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness
p364
aVand, I would say, nakedness,
p365
aVthat has made the Tarahumara
p366
aVone of the healthiest and serene cultures in our time.
p367
aVSo what's the benefit? So what?
p368
aVSo you burn off the Häagen-Dazs from the night before.
p369
aa(lp370
VBut maybe there's another benefit there as well.
p371
aVWithout getting too extreme about this,
p372
aVimagine a world where everybody could go out the door
p373
aVand engage in the kind of exercise
p374
aVthat's going to make them more relaxed, more serene,
p375
aVmore healthy,
p376
aVburn off stress \u2014
p377
aVwhere you don't come back into your office a raging maniac anymore,
p378
aVor go home with a lot of stress on top of you again.
p379
aVMaybe there's something between what we are today
p380
aVand what the Tarahumara have always been.
p381
aVI don't say let's go back to the Copper Canyons
p382
aVand live on corn and maize, which is the Tarahumara's preferred diet,
p383
aVbut maybe there's somewhere in between.
p384
aVAnd if we find that thing,
p385
aVmaybe there is a big fat Nobel Prize out there.
p386
aVBecause if somebody could find a way to restore that natural ability
p387
aVthat we all enjoyed for most of our existence
p388
aVup until the 1970s or so,
p389
aVthe benefits \u2014 social and physical and political and mental \u2014
p390
aVcould be astounding.
p391
aa(lp392
VWhat I've been seeing today is there is a growing subculture
p393
aVof barefoot runners, people who've gotten rid of their shoes.
p394
aVAnd what they have found uniformly is,
p395
aVyou get rid of the shoes, you get rid of the stress,
p396
aVyou get rid of the injuries and the ailments.
p397
aVAnd what you find is something the Tarahumara have known
p398
aVfor a very long time:
p399
aVthat this can be a whole lot of fun.
p400
aVI've experienced it personally myself.
p401
aVI was injured all my life; then in my early 40s, I got rid of my shoes
p402
aVand my running ailments have gone away, too.
p403
aa(lp404
VSo hopefully it's something we can all benefit from.
p405
aVI appreciate your listening to this story.
p406
aa(lp407
VThanks very much.
