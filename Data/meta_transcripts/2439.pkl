V1.3 billion years ago,
p4
aVin a distant, distant galaxy,
p5
aVtwo black holes locked into a spiral,
p6
aVfalling inexorably towards each other
p7
aVand collided,
p8
aVconverting three Suns' worth of stuff
p9
aVinto pure energy in a tenth of a second.
p10
aVFor that brief moment in time,
p11
aVthe glow was brighter than all the stars
p12
aVin all the galaxies
p13
aVin all of the known Universe.
p14
aVIt was a very
p15
aVbig
p16
aVbang.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut they didn't release their energy in light.
p19
aVI mean, you know, they're black holes.
p20
aVAll that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself,
p21
aVmaking the Universe explode in gravitational waves.
p22
aa(lp23
VLet me give you a sense of the timescale at work here.
p24
aV1.3 billion years ago,
p25
aVEarth had just managed to evolve multicellular life.
p26
aVSince then, Earth has made and evolved
p27
aVcorals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and even \u2014 God save us \u2014 the Internet.
p28
aVAnd about 25 years ago,
p29
aVa particularly audacious set of people \u2014
p30
aVRai Weiss at MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever at Caltech \u2014
p31
aVdecided that it would be really neat
p32
aVto build a giant laser detector
p33
aVwith which to search for the gravitational waves
p34
aVfrom things like colliding black holes.
p35
aa(lp36
VNow, most people thought they were nuts.
p37
aVBut enough people realized that they were brilliant nuts
p38
aVthat the US National Science Foundation decided to fund their crazy idea.
p39
aVSo after decades of development,
p40
aVconstruction and imagination
p41
aVand a breathtaking amount of hard work,
p42
aVthey built their detector, called LIGO:
p43
aVThe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.
p44
aa(lp45
VFor the last several years,
p46
aVLIGO's been undergoing a huge expansion in its accuracy,
p47
aVa tremendous improvement in its detection ability.
p48
aVIt's now called Advanced LIGO as a result.
p49
aa(lp50
VIn early September of 2015,
p51
aVLIGO turned on for a final test run
p52
aVwhile they sorted out a few lingering details.
p53
aVAnd on September 14 of 2015,
p54
aVjust days after the detector had gone live,
p55
aVthe gravitational waves from those colliding black holes
p56
aVpassed through the Earth.
p57
aVAnd they passed through you and me.
p58
aVAnd they passed through the detector.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Audio) Scott Hughes: There's two moments in my life
p61
aVmore emotionally intense than that.
p62
aVOne is the birth of my daughter.
p63
aVThe other is when I had to say goodbye to my father when he was terminally ill.
p64
aVYou know, it was the payoff of my career, basically.
p65
aVEverything I'd been working on \u2014 it's no longer science fiction! (Laughs)
p66
aa(lp67
VAllan Adams: So that's my very good friend and collaborator, Scott Hughes,
p68
aVa theoretical physicist at MIT,
p69
aVwho has been studying gravitational waves from black holes
p70
aVand the signals that they could impart on observatories like LIGO,
p71
aVfor the past 23 years.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gravitational wave.
p74
aVA gravitational wave is a ripple
p75
aVin the shape of space and time.
p76
aVAs the wave passes by,
p77
aVit stretches space and everything in it
p78
aVin one direction,
p79
aVand compresses it in the other.
p80
aVThis has led to countless instructors of general relativity
p81
aVdoing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity.
p82
aV"It stretches and expands, it stretches and expands."
p83
aa(lp84
VSo the trouble with gravitational waves
p85
aVis that they're very weak; they're preposterously weak.
p86
aVFor example, the waves that hit us on September 14 \u2014
p87
aVand yes, every single one of you stretched and compressed
p88
aVunder the action of that wave \u2014
p89
aVwhen the waves hit, they stretched the average person
p90
aVby one part in 10 to the 21.
p91
aVThat's a decimal place, 20 zeroes,
p92
aVand a one.
p93
aVThat's why everyone thought the LIGO people were nuts.
p94
aVEven with a laser detector five kilometers long \u2014 and that's already crazy \u2014
p95
aVthey would have to measure the length of those detectors
p96
aVto less than one thousandth of the radius of the nucleus
p97
aVof an atom.
p98
aVAnd that's preposterous.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo towards the end of his classic text on gravity,
p101
aVLIGO co-founder Kip Thorne
p102
aVdescribed the hunt for gravitational waves as follows:
p103
aVHe said, "The technical difficulties to be surmounted
p104
aVin constructing such detectors
p105
aVare enormous.
p106
aVBut physicists are ingenious,
p107
aVand with the support of a broad lay public,
p108
aVall obstacles will surely be overcome."
p109
aVThorne published that in 1973,
p110
aV42 years before he succeeded.
p111
aa(lp112
VNow, coming back to LIGO,
p113
aVScott likes to say that LIGO acts like an ear
p114
aVmore than it does like an eye.
p115
aVI want to explain what that means.
p116
aVVisible light has a wavelength, a size,
p117
aVthat's much smaller than the things around you,
p118
aVthe features on people's faces,
p119
aVthe size of your cell phone.
p120
aVAnd that's really useful,
p121
aVbecause it lets you make an image or a map of the things around you,
p122
aVby looking at the light coming from different spots
p123
aVin the scene about you.
p124
aa(lp125
VSound is different.
p126
aVAudible sound has a wavelength that can be up to 50 feet long.
p127
aVAnd that makes it really difficult \u2014
p128
aVin fact, in practical purposes, impossible \u2014 to make an image
p129
aVof something you really care about.
p130
aVYour child's face.
p131
aVInstead, we use sound to listen for features like pitch
p132
aVand tone and rhythm and volume
p133
aVto infer a story behind the sounds.
p134
aVThat's Alice talking.
p135
aVThat's Bob interrupting.
p136
aVSilly Bob.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo, the same is true of gravitational waves.
p139
aVWe can't use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe.
p140
aVBut by listening to changes
p141
aVin the amplitude and frequency of those waves,
p142
aVwe can hear the story that those waves are telling.
p143
aVAnd at least for LIGO,
p144
aVthe frequencies that it can hear are in the audio band.
p145
aVSo if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air, into sound,
p146
aVwe can literally hear the Universe speaking to us.
p147
aVFor example, listening to gravity, just in this way,
p148
aVcan tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes,
p149
aVsomething my colleague Scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Audio) SH: If the two black holes are non-spinning,
p152
aVyou get a very simple chirp: whoop!
p153
aVIf the two bodies are spinning very rapidly, I have that same chirp,
p154
aVbut with a modulation on top of it,
p155
aVso it kind of goes: whir, whir, whir!
p156
aVIt's sort of the vocabulary of spin imprinted on this waveform.
p157
aa(lp158
VAA: So on September 14, 2015,
p159
aVa date that's definitely going to live in my memory,
p160
aVLIGO heard this:
p161
aa(lp162
V[Whirring sound]
p163
aa(lp164
VSo if you know how to listen, that is the sound of \u2014
p165
aa(lp166
V(Audio) SH: ... two black holes, each of about 30 solar masses,
p167
aVthat were whirling around at a rate
p168
aVcomparable to what goes on in your blender.
p169
aa(lp170
VAA: It's worth pausing here to think about what that means.
p171
aVTwo black holes, the densest thing in the Universe,
p172
aVone with a mass of 29 Suns
p173
aVand one with a mass of 36 Suns,
p174
aVwhirling around each other 100 times per second
p175
aVbefore they collide.
p176
aVJust imagine the power of that.
p177
aVIt's fantastic.
p178
aVAnd we know it because we heard it.
p179
aa(lp180
VThat's the lasting importance of LIGO.
p181
aVIt's an entirely new way to observe the Universe
p182
aVthat we've never had before.
p183
aVIt's a way that lets us hear the Universe
p184
aVand hear the invisible.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd there's a lot out there that we can't see \u2014
p187
aVin practice or even in principle.
p188
aVSo supernova, for example:
p189
aVI would love to know why very massive stars explode in supernovae.
p190
aVThey're very useful;
p191
aVwe've learned a lot about the Universe from them.
p192
aVThe problem is, all the interesting physics happens in the core,
p193
aVand the core is hidden behind thousands of kilometers
p194
aVof iron and carbon and silicon.
p195
aVWe'll never see through it, it's opaque to light.
p196
aVGravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass \u2014
p197
aVtotally transparent.
p198
aVThe Big Bang: I would love to be able to explore
p199
aVthe first few moments of the Universe,
p200
aVbut we'll never see them,
p201
aVbecause the Big Bang itself is obscured by its own afterglow.
p202
aVWith gravitational waves,
p203
aVwe should be able to see all the way back to the beginning.
p204
aVPerhaps most importantly,
p205
aVI'm positive that there are things out there
p206
aVthat we've never seen
p207
aVthat we may never be able to see
p208
aVand that we haven't even imagined \u2014
p209
aVthings that we'll only discover by listening.
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd in fact, even in that very first event,
p212
aVLIGO found things that we didn't expect.
p213
aVHere's my colleague and one of the key members of the LIGO collaboration,
p214
aVMatt Evans, my colleague at MIT, addressing exactly that:
p215
aa(lp216
V(Audio) Matt Evans: The kinds of stars which produce the black holes
p217
aVthat we observed here
p218
aVare the dinosaurs of the Universe.
p219
aVThey're these massive things that are old, from prehistoric times,
p220
aVand the black holes are kind of like the dinosaur bones
p221
aVwith which we do this archeology.
p222
aVSo it lets us really get a whole nother angle
p223
aVon what's out there in the Universe
p224
aVand how the stars came to be, and in the end, of course,
p225
aVhow we came to be out of this whole mess.
p226
aa(lp227
VAA: Our challenge now
p228
aVis to be as audacious as possible.
p229
aVThanks to LIGO, we know how to build exquisite detectors
p230
aVthat can listen to the Universe,
p231
aVto the rustle and the chirp of the cosmos.
p232
aVOur job is to dream up and build new observatories \u2014
p233
aVa whole new generation of observatories \u2014
p234
aVon the ground, in space.
p235
aVI mean, what could be more glorious than listening to the Big Bang itself?
p236
aVOur job now is to dream big.
p237
aVDream with us.
