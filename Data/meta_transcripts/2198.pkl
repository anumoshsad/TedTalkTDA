VAn 18-year-old, African-American male joined the United States Air Force
p4
aVand was assigned to Mountain Home  Air Force Base
p5
aVand was a part of the air police squadron.
p6
aVUpon first arriving there, the first goal that I had
p7
aVwas for me to identify an apartment,
p8
aVso I could bring my wife  and my new baby, Melanie,
p9
aVout to join me in Idaho.
p10
aa(lp11
VI immediately went to  the personnel office,
p12
aVand talking with the guys in personnel,
p13
aVthey said, "Hey, no problem finding  an apartment in Mountain Home, Idaho.
p14
aVThe people down there love us  because they know if they have an airman
p15
aVwho is coming in to rent  one of their apartments,
p16
aVthey'll always get their money."
p17
aVAnd that was a really important thing.
p18
aVHe said, "So here is a list  of people that you can call,
p19
aVand then they will then allow you  to select the apartment that you want."
p20
aVSo I got the list; I made the call.
p21
aVThe lady answered on the other end and I told her what I wanted.
p22
aVShe said, "Oh, great you called.
p23
aVWe have four or five apartments available right now."
p24
aVShe said, "Do you want  a one-bedroom or two-bedroom?"
p25
aVThen she said, "Let's not talk about that.
p26
aVJust come on down,  select the apartment that you want.
p27
aVWe'll sign the contract
p28
aVand you'll have keys in your hand to get your family out here right away."
p29
aa(lp30
VSo I was excited.
p31
aVI jumped in my car. I went downtown and knocked on the door.
p32
aVWhen I knocked on the door,  the woman came to the door,
p33
aVand she looked at me, and she said, "Can I help you?"
p34
aVI said, "Yes, I'm the person  who called about the apartments.
p35
aVI was just coming down  to make my selection."
p36
aVShe said, "You know what?  I'm really sorry,
p37
aVbut my husband rented those apartments and didn't tell me about them."
p38
aVI said, "You mean he rented  all five of them in one hour?"
p39
aVShe didn't give me a response, and what she said was this:
p40
aVShe said, "Why don't you leave your number,
p41
aVand if we have some openings,  I'll give you a call?"
p42
aVNeedless to say, I did not get a call from her.
p43
aVNor did I get any responses  from the other people
p44
aVthat they gave me on the list where I could get apartments.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo as a result of that, and feeling rejected,
p47
aVI went back to the base, and I talked to the squadron commander.
p48
aVHis name was McDow, Major McDow.
p49
aVI said, "Major McDow, I need your help."
p50
aVI told him what happened,  and here's what he said to me:
p51
aVHe said, "James, I would love to help you.
p52
aVBut you know the problem:
p53
aVWe can't make people rent to folks  that they don't want to rent to.
p54
aVAnd besides, we have a great relationship with people in the community
p55
aVand we really don't want to damage that."
p56
aVHe said, "So maybe this is  what you should do.
p57
aVWhy don't you let your family stay home,
p58
aVbecause you do know  that you get a 30-day leave.
p59
aVSo once a year,
p60
aVyou can go home to your family, spend 30 days and then come on back."
p61
aa(lp62
VNeedless to say, that didn't resonate for me.
p63
aVSo after leaving him,  I went back to personnel,
p64
aVand talking to the clerk,
p65
aVhe said, "Jim, I think I have a  solution for you.
p66
aVThere's an airman who is leaving and he has a trailer.
p67
aVIf you noticed, in Mountain Home,
p68
aVthere are trailer parks and trailers all over the place.
p69
aVYou can buy his trailer, and you'd probably get a really good deal
p70
aVbecause he wants to get out of town as soon as possible.
p71
aVAnd that would take care of your problem,
p72
aVand that would provide  the solution for you."
p73
aVSo I immediately jumped in my car, went downtown, saw the trailer \u2014
p74
aVit was a small trailer,
p75
aVbut under the circumstances,
p76
aVI figured that was the  best thing that I could do.
p77
aVSo I bought the trailer.
p78
aVAnd then I asked him,  "Can I just leave the trailer here,
p79
aVand that would take care  of all my problems,
p80
aVI wouldn't have to find another trailer park?"
p81
aVHe said, "Before I say yes to that,  I need to check with management."
p82
aVSo I get back to the base,
p83
aVhe called me back and management said,
p84
aV"No, you can't leave the trailer here
p85
aVbecause we had promised that slot to some other people."
p86
aVAnd that was strange to me
p87
aVbecause there were several  other slots that were open,
p88
aVbut it just so happened that he  had promised that slot to someone else.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo, what I did \u2014
p91
aVand he said, "You shouldn't worry, Jim, because there are a lot of trailer parks."
p92
aVSo I put out another exhaustive list of going to trailer parks.
p93
aVI went to one after another,  after another.
p94
aVAnd I got the same kind of rejection there
p95
aVthat I received when I was looking  for the apartment.
p96
aVAnd as a result, the kind of comments that they made to me,
p97
aVin addition to saying that they didn't have any slots open,
p98
aVone person said, "Jim, the reason why we can't rent to you,
p99
aVwe already have a Negro family in the trailer park."
p100
aVHe said, "And it's not me,  because I like you people."
p101
aV(Laughs)
p102
aVAnd that's what I did, too. I chuckled, too.
p103
aVHe said, "But here's the problem:
p104
aVIf I let you in, the other tenants  will move out
p105
aVand I can't afford to take that kind of a hit."
p106
aVHe said, "I just can't rent to you."
p107
aa(lp108
VEven though that was discouraging, it didn't stop me.
p109
aVI kept looking,
p110
aVand I looked at the far end  of the town in Mountain Home,
p111
aVand there was a small trailer park.
p112
aVI mean, a really small trailer park.
p113
aVIt didn't have any paved roads in it,
p114
aVit didn't have the concrete slabs,
p115
aVit didn't have fencing
p116
aVto portion off your trailer slot  from other trailer slots.
p117
aVIt didn't have a laundry facility.
p118
aVBut the conclusion I reached  at that moment
p119
aVwas that I didn't have  a lot of other options.
p120
aVSo I called my wife, and I said, "We're going to make this one work."
p121
aVAnd we moved into it
p122
aVand we became homeowners in Mountain Home, Idaho.
p123
aVAnd of course, eventually things settled down.
p124
aa(lp125
VFour years after that, I received papers to move from Mountain Home, Idaho
p126
aVto a place called Goose Bay, Labrador.
p127
aVWe won't even talk about that. It was another great location. (Laughter)
p128
aVSo my challenge then was to get my family  from Mountain Home, Idaho
p129
aVto Sharon, Pennsylvania.
p130
aVThat wasn't a problem because we had just purchased a brand-new automobile.
p131
aVMy mother called  and said she'll fly out.
p132
aVShe'll be with us as we drive, she'll help us manage the children.
p133
aVSo she came out, her and Alice  put a lot of food together for the trip.
p134
aa(lp135
VThat morning, we left at about 5 a.m.
p136
aVGreat trip, having a great time,  good conversation.
p137
aVSomewhere around 6:30, 7 o'clock, we got a little bit tired,
p138
aVand we said, "Why don't we get a motel so that we can rest
p139
aVand then have an early start in the morning?"
p140
aVSo we were looking at a number  of the motels as we drove down the road,
p141
aVand we saw one, it was a great big, bright flashing light that said,
p142
aV"Vacancies, Vacancies, Vacanies."
p143
aVSo we stopped in.
p144
aVThey were in the parking lot,  I went inside.
p145
aVWhen I walked inside,
p146
aVthe lady was just finishing up  one contract with some folks,
p147
aVsome other people  were coming in behind me.
p148
aVAnd so I walked to the counter,
p149
aVand she said, "How can I help you?"
p150
aVI said, "I would like to get a motel  for the evening for my family."
p151
aVShe said, "You know, I'm really sorry, I just rented the last one.
p152
aVWe will not have any more  until the morning."
p153
aVShe said, "But if you go down the road about an hour, 45 minutes,
p154
aVthere's another trailer park down there."
p155
aVI said, "Yeah, but you still have the  'Vacancies' light on, and it's flashing."
p156
aVShe said, "Oh, I forgot."
p157
aVAnd she reached over  and turned the light off.
p158
aVShe looked at me and I looked at her.
p159
aVThere were other people in the room.
p160
aVShe kind of looked at them. No one said anything.
p161
aVSo I just got the hint and I left, and went outside to the parking lot.
p162
aVAnd I told my mother and I told my wife and also Melanie, and I said,
p163
aV"It looks like we're going to have to drive a little bit further down the road
p164
aVto be able to sleep tonight."
p165
aVAnd we did drive down the road,
p166
aVbut just before we took off  and pulled out of the parking lot,
p167
aVguess what happened?
p168
aVThe light came back on.
p169
aVAnd it said, "Vacancies,  Vacancies, Vacancies."
p170
aVWe were able to find a nice place.
p171
aVIt wasn't our preference, but it was secure and it was clean.
p172
aVAnd so we had a great sleep that night.
p173
aa(lp174
VThe piece that's important about that
p175
aVis that we had similar kinds of experiences
p176
aVfrom Idaho all the way through  to Pennsylvania,
p177
aVwhere we were rejected from hotels,  motels and restaurants.
p178
aVBut we made it to Pennsylvania.
p179
aVWe got the family settled. Everyone was glad to see the kids.
p180
aVI jumped on a plane and shot off to Goose Bay, Labrador,
p181
aVwhich is another story, right?
p182
aV(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VHere it is, 53 years later,
p185
aVI now have nine grandchildren,  two great-grandchildren.
p186
aVFive of the grandchildren are boys.
p187
aVI have master's, Ph.D., undergrad, one in medical school.
p188
aVI have a couple that are trending.
p189
aVThey're almost there but not quite. (Laughter)
p190
aVI have one who has been  in college now for eight years.
p191
aV(Laughter)
p192
aVHe doesn't have a degree yet,  but he wants to be a comedian.
p193
aVSo we're just trying to get him to stay in school.
p194
aVBecause you never know,
p195
aVjust because you're funny at home, does not make you a comedian, right?
p196
aV(Laughter)
p197
aVBut the thing about it,  they're all good kids \u2014
p198
aVno drugs, no babies  in high school, no crime.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo with that being the backdrop,
p201
aVI was sitting in my TV room watching TV,
p202
aVand they were talking about Ferguson and all the hullabaloo that was going on.
p203
aVAnd all of a sudden, one of the news  commentators got on the air and she said,
p204
aV"In the last three months,
p205
aVeight unarmed African-American males
p206
aVhave been killed by police, white homeowners, or white citizens."
p207
aVFor some reason, at that moment it just all hit me.
p208
aVI said, "What is it? It is so insane.
p209
aVWhat is the hatred that's causing people  to do these kinds of things?"
p210
aa(lp211
VJust then, one of my grandsons called.
p212
aVHe said, "Granddad, did you hear what they said on TV?"
p213
aVI said, "Yes, I did."
p214
aVHe said, "I'm just so confused.
p215
aVWe do everything we do, but it seems that driving while black,
p216
aVwalking while black, talking while black, it's just dangerous.
p217
aVWhat can we do? We do everything that you told us to do.
p218
aVWhen stopped by the police,
p219
aVwe place both hands on the steering wheel at the 12 o'clock position.
p220
aVIf asked to get identification,
p221
aVwe tell them, 'I am slowly reaching over  into the glove compartment to get my I.D.'
p222
aVWhen pulled out of the car to be searched,
p223
aVwhen laid on the ground to be searched,
p224
aVwhen our trunks are opened to be searched,
p225
aVwe don't push back, we don't challenge because we know, you've told us,
p226
aV'Don't you challenge the police.
p227
aVAfter it's over, call us and we'll be the ones to challenge."
p228
aa(lp229
VHe said, "And this is the piece  that really bugs me:
p230
aVOur white friends, our buddies, we kind of hang together.
p231
aVWhen they hear about these kinds of things happening to us, they say,
p232
aV'Why do you take it?
p233
aVYou need to push back. You need to challenge.
p234
aVYou need to ask them  for their identification.'"
p235
aVAnd here's what the boys have been taught to tell them:
p236
aV"We know that you can do that, but please do not do that
p237
aVwhile we're in the car
p238
aVbecause the consequences for you are significantly different
p239
aVthan the consequences for us."
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd so as a grandparent,  what do I tell my grandsons?
p242
aVHow do I keep them safe? How do I keep them alive?
p243
aVAs a result of this, people have come to me and said,
p244
aV"Jim, are you angry?"
p245
aVAnd my response to that is this:
p246
aV"I don't have the luxury of being angry,
p247
aVand I also know the consequences  of being enraged."
p248
aa(lp249
VSo therefore, the only thing that I can do
p250
aVis take my collective intellect and my energy and my ideas and my experiences
p251
aVand dedicate myself to challenge,  at any point in time,
p252
aVanything that looks  like it might be racist.
p253
aVSo the first thing I have  to do is to educate,
p254
aVthe second thing I have to do  is to unveil racism,
p255
aVand the last thing I need to do is do everything within my power
p256
aVto eradicate racism in my lifetime by any means necessary.
p257
aa(lp258
VThe second thing I do is this:
p259
aVI want to appeal to Americans.
p260
aVI want to appeal to their humanity, to their dignity,
p261
aVto their civic pride and ownership
p262
aVto be able to not react to these  heinous crimes in an adverse manner.
p263
aVBut instead, to elevate your level of societal knowledge,
p264
aVyour level of societal awareness and societal consciousness
p265
aVto then collectively come together, all of us come together,
p266
aVto make sure that we speak out against and we challenge any kind of insanity,
p267
aVany kind of insanity that makes it  okay to kill unarmed people,
p268
aVregardless of their ethnicity,
p269
aVregardless of their race,
p270
aVregardless of their diversity makeup.
p271
aa(lp272
VWe have to challenge that. It doesn't make any sense.
p273
aVThe only way I think we can do that is through a collective.
p274
aVWe need to have black and white  and Asian and Hispanic
p275
aVjust to step forward and say,
p276
aV"We are not going to accept  that kind of behavior anymore."
