(lp3
VSo, I was just asked to go and shoot this film called "Elizabeth."
p4
aVAnd we're all talking about this great English icon and saying,
p5
aV"She's a fantastic woman, she does everything.
p6
aVHow are we going to introduce her?"
p7
aVSo we went around the table with the studio and the producers and the writer,
p8
aVand they came to me and said, "Shekhar, what do you think?"
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd I said, "I think she's dancing."
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd I could see everybody looked at me,
p13
aVsomebody said, "Bollywood."
p14
aa(lp15
VThe other said, "How much did we hire him for?"
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd the third said, "Let's find another director."
p18
aa(lp19
VI thought I had better change.
p20
aVSo we had a lot of discussion on how to introduce Elizabeth,
p21
aVand I said, "OK, maybe I am too Bollywood.
p22
aVMaybe Elizabeth, this great icon, dancing?
p23
aVWhat are you talking about?"
p24
aVSo I rethought the whole thing,
p25
aVand then we all came to a consensus.
p26
aVAnd here was the introduction of this
p27
aVgreat British icon called "Elizabeth."
p28
aa(lp29
VLeicester: May I join you, my lady?
p30
aa(lp31
VElizabeth: If it please you, sir.
p32
aV(Music)
p33
aa(lp34
VShekhar Kapur: So she was dancing.
p35
aVSo how many people who saw the film did not get
p36
aVthat here was a woman in love,
p37
aVthat she was completely innocent
p38
aVand saw great joy in her life, and she was youthful?
p39
aVAnd how many of you did not get that?
p40
aVThat's the power of visual storytelling,
p41
aVthat's the power of dance, that's the power of music:
p42
aVthe power of not knowing.
p43
aa(lp44
VWhen I go out to direct a film,
p45
aVevery day we prepare too much, we think too much.
p46
aVKnowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom.
p47
aVYou know, simple words lost
p48
aVin the quicksand of experience.
p49
aVSo I come up, and I say,
p50
aV"What am I going to do today?" I'm not going to do what I planned to do,
p51
aVand I put myself into absolute panic.
p52
aVIt's my one way of getting rid of my mind,
p53
aVgetting rid of this mind that says,
p54
aV"Hey, you know what you're doing. You know exactly what you're doing.
p55
aVYou're a director, you've done it for years."
p56
aVSo I've got to get there
p57
aVand be in complete panic.
p58
aVIt's a symbolic gesture. I tear up the script,
p59
aVI go and I panic myself, I get scared.
p60
aVI'm doing it right now; you can watch me. I'm getting nervous,
p61
aVI don't know what to say, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't want to go there.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd as I go there, of course, my A.D. says,
p64
aV"You know what you're going to do, sir." I say, "Of course I do."
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd the studio executives, they would say,
p67
aV"Hey, look at Shekhar. He's so prepared."
p68
aVAnd inside I've just been listening to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan
p69
aVbecause he's chaotic.
p70
aVI'm allowing myself to go into chaos
p71
aVbecause out of chaos, I'm hoping some moments of truth will come.
p72
aVAll preparation is preparation.
p73
aVI don't even know if it's honest.
p74
aVI don't even know if it's truthful.
p75
aVThe truth of it all comes on the moment, organically,
p76
aVand if you get five great moments
p77
aVof great, organic stuff
p78
aVin your storytelling, in your film,
p79
aVyour film, audiences will get it.
p80
aVSo I'm looking for those moments, and I'm standing there
p81
aVand saying, "I don't know what to say."
p82
aa(lp83
VSo, ultimately, everybody's looking at you,
p84
aV200 people at seven in the morning
p85
aVwho got there at quarter to seven, and you arrived at seven,
p86
aVand everybody's saying,
p87
aV"Hey. What's the first thing? What's going to happen?"
p88
aVAnd you put yourself into a state of panic
p89
aVwhere you don't know, and so you don't know.
p90
aVAnd so, because you don't know,
p91
aVyou're praying to the universe because you're praying to the universe
p92
aVthat something \u2014 I'm going to try and access the universe
p93
aVthe way Einstein \u2014 say a prayer \u2014
p94
aVaccessed his equations,
p95
aVthe same source. I'm looking for the same source
p96
aVbecause creativity comes from absolutely the same source
p97
aVthat you meditate somewhere outside yourself,
p98
aVoutside the universe.
p99
aVYou're looking for something that comes and hits you.
p100
aVUntil that hits you, you're not going to do the first shot.
p101
aVSo what do you do?
p102
aa(lp103
VSo Cate says, "Shekhar, what do you want me to do?"
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd I say, "Cate, what do you want to do?" (Laughter)
p106
aV"You're a great actor, and I like to give to my actors \u2014
p107
aVwhy don't you show me what you want to do?"
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aVWhat am I doing? I'm trying to buy time.
p110
aVI'm trying to buy time.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo the first thing about storytelling that I learned,
p113
aVand I follow all the time is: Panic.
p114
aVPanic is the great access of creativity
p115
aVbecause that's the only way to get rid of your mind.
p116
aVGet rid of your mind.
p117
aVGet out of it, get it out.
p118
aVAnd let's go to the universe because
p119
aVthere's something out there that is more
p120
aVtruthful than your mind,
p121
aVthat is more truthful than your universe.
p122
aV[unclear], you said that yesterday. I'm just repeating it
p123
aVbecause that's what I follow constantly
p124
aVto find the shunyata somewhere, the emptiness.
p125
aVOut of the emptiness comes a moment of creativity.
p126
aVSo that's what I do.
p127
aa(lp128
VWhen I was a kid \u2014 I was about eight years old.
p129
aVYou remember how India was. There was no pollution.
p130
aVIn Delhi, we used to live \u2014 we used to call it a chhat or the khota.
p131
aVKhota's now become a bad word. It means their terrace \u2014
p132
aVand we used to sleep out at night.
p133
aVAt school I was being just taught about physics,
p134
aVand I was told that
p135
aVif there is something that exists,
p136
aVthen it is measurable.
p137
aVIf it is not measurable,
p138
aVit does not exist.
p139
aVAnd at night I would lie out, looking at the unpolluted sky,
p140
aVas Delhi used to be at that time when I was a kid,
p141
aVand I used to stare at the universe and say,
p142
aV"How far does this universe go?"
p143
aa(lp144
VMy father was a doctor.
p145
aVAnd I would think, "Daddy, how far does the universe go?"
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd he said, "Son, it goes on forever."
p148
aa(lp149
VSo I said, "Please measure forever
p150
aVbecause in school they're teaching me
p151
aVthat if I cannot measure it, it does not exist.
p152
aVIt doesn't come into my frame of reference."
p153
aVSo, how far does eternity go?
p154
aVWhat does forever mean?
p155
aVAnd I would lie there crying at night
p156
aVbecause my imagination could not touch creativity.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo what did I do?
p159
aVAt that time, at the tender age of seven,
p160
aVI created a story.
p161
aVWhat was my story?
p162
aVAnd I don't know why, but I remember the story.
p163
aVThere was a woodcutter
p164
aVwho's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood,
p165
aVand the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax.
p166
aVAnd when that ax hits that piece of wood,
p167
aVthat's when everything will destroy
p168
aVand the Big Bang will happen again.
p169
aVBut all before that there was a woodcutter.
p170
aVAnd then when I would run out of that story,
p171
aVI would imagine that woodcutter's universe
p172
aVis one atom in the ax of another woodcutter.
p173
aVSo every time, I could tell my story again and again
p174
aVand get over this problem,
p175
aVand so I got over the problem.
p176
aa(lp177
VHow did I do it? Tell a story.
p178
aVSo what is a story?
p179
aVA story is our \u2014 all of us \u2014
p180
aVwe are the stories we tell ourselves.
p181
aVIn this universe, and this existence,
p182
aVwhere we live with this duality
p183
aVof whether we exist or not
p184
aVand who are we,
p185
aVthe stories we tell ourselves are the stories
p186
aVthat define the potentialities
p187
aVof our existence.
p188
aVWe are the stories we tell ourselves.
p189
aVSo that's as wide as we look at stories.
p190
aVA story is the relationship
p191
aVthat you develop between who you are,
p192
aVor who you potentially are,
p193
aVand the infinite world, and that's our mythology.
p194
aa(lp195
VWe tell our stories,
p196
aVand a person without a story does not exist.
p197
aVSo Einstein told a story
p198
aVand followed his stories and came up with theories
p199
aVand came up with theories and then came up with his equations.
p200
aVAlexander had a story that his mother used to tell him,
p201
aVand he went out to conquer the world.
p202
aVWe all, everybody, has a story that they follow.
p203
aVWe tell ourselves stories.
p204
aVSo, I will go further, and I say,
p205
aV"I tell a story, and therefore I exist."
p206
aVI exist because there are stories,
p207
aVand if there are no stories, we don't exist.
p208
aVWe create stories to define our existence.
p209
aVIf we do not create the stories,
p210
aVwe probably go mad.
p211
aVI don't know; I'm not sure, but that's what I've done all the time.
p212
aa(lp213
VNow, a film.
p214
aVA film tells a story.
p215
aVI often wonder when I make a film \u2014 I'm thinking of making a film of the Buddha \u2014
p216
aVand I often wonder: If Buddha had all the elements
p217
aVthat are given to a director \u2014
p218
aVif he had music, if he had visuals, if he had a video camera \u2014
p219
aVwould we get Buddhism better?
p220
aVBut that puts some kind of burden on me.
p221
aVI have to tell a story
p222
aVin a much more elaborate way,
p223
aVbut I have the potential.
p224
aVIt's called subtext.
p225
aVWhen I first went to Hollywood, they said \u2014
p226
aVI used to talk about subtext, and my agent came to me,
p227
aV"Would you kindly not talk about subtext?"
p228
aVAnd I said, "Why?" He said, "Because nobody is going to give you a film
p229
aVif you talk about subtext.
p230
aVJust talk about plot
p231
aVand say how wonderful you'll shoot the film,
p232
aVwhat the visuals will be."
p233
aa(lp234
VSo when I look at a film,
p235
aVhere's what we look for:
p236
aVWe look for a story on the plot level,
p237
aVthen we look for a story
p238
aVon the psychological level,
p239
aVthen we look for a story on the political level,
p240
aVthen we look at a story
p241
aVon a mythological level.
p242
aVAnd I look for stories on each level.
p243
aVNow, it is not necessary
p244
aVthat these stories agree with each other.
p245
aVWhat is wonderful is,
p246
aVat many times, the stories will contradict with each other.
p247
aVSo when I work with Rahman who's a great musician,
p248
aVI often tell him, "Don't follow what the script already says.
p249
aVFind that which is not.
p250
aVFind the truth for yourself,
p251
aVand when you find the truth for yourself,
p252
aVthere will be a truth in it, but it may contradict the plot,
p253
aVbut don't worry about it."
p254
aa(lp255
VSo, the sequel to "Elizabeth," "Golden Age."
p256
aVWhen I made the sequel to "Elizabeth," here was a story that
p257
aVthe writer was telling:
p258
aVA woman who was threatened
p259
aVby Philip II
p260
aVand was going to war,
p261
aVand was going to war, fell in love with Walter Raleigh.
p262
aVBecause she fell in love with Walter Raleigh,
p263
aVshe was giving up the reasons she was a queen,
p264
aVand then Walter Raleigh
p265
aVfell in love with her lady in waiting,
p266
aVand she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war
p267
aVor she wanted...
p268
aa(lp269
VHere's the story I was telling:
p270
aVThe gods up there,
p271
aVthere were two people.
p272
aVThere was Philip II, who was divine
p273
aVbecause he was always praying,
p274
aVand there was Elizabeth, who was divine,
p275
aVbut not quite divine because she thought she was divine,
p276
aVbut the blood of being mortal flowed in her.
p277
aVBut the divine one was unjust,
p278
aVso the gods said,
p279
aV"OK, what we need to do is
p280
aVhelp the just one."
p281
aVAnd so they helped the just one.
p282
aVAnd what they did was, they sent Walter Raleigh down
p283
aVto physically separate her mortal self
p284
aVfrom her spirit self.
p285
aVAnd the mortal self was the girl
p286
aVthat Walter Raleigh was sent,
p287
aVand gradually he separated her
p288
aVso she was free to be divine.
p289
aVAnd the two divine people fought,
p290
aVand the gods were on the side of divinity.
p291
aa(lp292
VOf course, all the British press got really upset.
p293
aVThey said, "We won the Armada."
p294
aa(lp295
VBut I said, "But the storm won the Armada.
p296
aVThe gods sent the storm."
p297
aa(lp298
VSo what was I doing?
p299
aVI was trying to find a mythic reason
p300
aVto make the film.
p301
aVOf course, when I asked Cate Blanchett, I said, "What's the film about?"
p302
aVShe said, "The film's about a woman
p303
aVcoming to terms with growing older."
p304
aVPsychological.
p305
aVThe writer said "It's about history, plot."
p306
aVI said "It's about mythology,
p307
aVthe gods."
p308
aa(lp309
VSo let me show you a film \u2014
p310
aVa piece from that film \u2014
p311
aVand how a camera also \u2014
p312
aVso this is a scene, where in my mind,
p313
aVshe was at the depths of mortality.
p314
aVShe was discovering what mortality actually means,
p315
aVand if she is at the depths of mortality,
p316
aVwhat really happens.
p317
aVAnd she's recognizing the dangers of mortality
p318
aVand why she should break away from mortality.
p319
aVRemember, in the film, to me,
p320
aVboth her and her lady in waiting
p321
aVwere parts of the same body,
p322
aVone the mortal self
p323
aVand one the spirit self.
p324
aa(lp325
VSo can we have that second?
p326
aa(lp327
V(Music)
p328
aa(lp329
VElizabeth: Bess?
p330
aVBess?
p331
aVBess Throckmorton?
p332
aa(lp333
VBess: Here, my lady.
p334
aa(lp335
VElizabeth: Tell me, is it true?
p336
aVAre you with child?
p337
aVAre you with child?
p338
aa(lp339
VBess: Yes, my lady.
p340
aa(lp341
VElizabeth: Traitorous.
p342
aVYou dare to keep secrets from me?
p343
aVYou ask my permission before you rut,
p344
aVbefore you breed.
p345
aVMy bitches wear my collars.
p346
aVDo you hear me? Do you hear me?
p347
aa(lp348
VWalsingham: Majesty. Please, dignity. Mercy.
p349
aa(lp350
VElizabeth: This is no time for mercy, Walsingham.
p351
aVYou go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business.
p352
aVIs it his?
p353
aVTell me. Say it. Is the child his? Is it his?
p354
aa(lp355
VBess: Yes.
p356
aVMy lady,
p357
aVit is my husband's child.
p358
aVElizabeth: Bitch! (Cries)
p359
aa(lp360
VRaleigh: Majesty.
p361
aVThis is not the queen I love and serve.
p362
aa(lp363
VElizabeth: This man has seduced a ward of the queen,
p364
aVand she has married without royal consent.
p365
aVThese offenses are punishable by law. Arrest him.
p366
aVGo.
p367
aVYou no longer have the queen's protection.
p368
aa(lp369
VBess: As you wish, Majesty.
p370
aa(lp371
VElizabeth: Get out! Get out! Get out!
p372
aVGet out.
p373
aa(lp374
V(Music)
p375
aa(lp376
VShekhar Kapur: So, what am I trying to do here?
p377
aVElizabeth has realized,
p378
aVand she's coming face-to-face
p379
aVwith her own sense of jealousy,
p380
aVher own sense of mortality.
p381
aVWhat am I doing with the architecture?
p382
aVThe architecture is telling a story.
p383
aVThe architecture is telling a story
p384
aVabout how, even though she's the most powerful woman
p385
aVin the world at that time,
p386
aVthere is the other, the architecture's bigger.
p387
aVThe stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic.
p388
aVIt'll survive her.
p389
aVSo it's telling you, to me, stone is part of her destiny.
p390
aVNot only that, why is the camera looking down?
p391
aVThe camera's looking down at her because she's in the well.
p392
aVShe's in the absolute well
p393
aVof her own sense of being mortal.
p394
aVThat's where she has to pull herself out
p395
aVfrom the depths of mortality,
p396
aVcome in, release her spirit.
p397
aVAnd that's the moment where, in my mind,
p398
aVboth Elizabeth and Bess are the same person.
p399
aVBut that's the moment
p400
aVshe's surgically removing herself from that.
p401
aVSo the film is operating on
p402
aVmany many levels in that scene.
p403
aVAnd how we tell stories
p404
aVvisually, with music, with actors,
p405
aVand at each level it's a different sense
p406
aVand sometimes contradictory to each other.
p407
aVSo how do I start all this?
p408
aVWhat's the process of telling a story?
p409
aa(lp410
VAbout ten years ago,
p411
aVI heard this little thing from a politician,
p412
aVnot a politician that was very well respected in India.
p413
aVAnd he said that these people in the cities,
p414
aVin one flush, expend as much water
p415
aVas you people in the rural areas
p416
aVdon't get for your family for two days.
p417
aVThat struck a chord, and I said, "That's true."
p418
aVI went to see a friend of mine,
p419
aVand he made me wait
p420
aVin his apartment in Malabar Hill
p421
aVon the twentieth floor,
p422
aVwhich is a really, really upmarket area in Mumbai.
p423
aVAnd he was having a shower for 20 minutes.
p424
aVI got bored and left, and as I drove out,
p425
aVI drove past the slums of Bombay,
p426
aVas you always do,
p427
aVand I saw lines and lines in the hot midday sun
p428
aVof women and children with buckets
p429
aVwaiting for a tanker
p430
aVto come and give them water.
p431
aVAnd an idea started to develop.
p432
aVSo how does that become a story?
p433
aVI suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster.
p434
aa(lp435
VSo my next film is called "Paani"
p436
aVwhich means water.
p437
aVAnd now, out of the mythology of that,
p438
aVI'm starting to create a world.
p439
aVWhat kind of world do I create,
p440
aVand where does the idea, the design of that come?
p441
aVSo, in my mind, in the future,
p442
aVthey started to build flyovers.
p443
aVYou understand flyovers? Yeah?
p444
aVThey started to build flyovers
p445
aVto get from A to B faster,
p446
aVbut they effectively went from one area of relative wealth
p447
aVto another area of relative wealth.
p448
aVAnd then what they did was
p449
aVthey created a city above the flyovers.
p450
aVAnd the rich people moved to the upper city
p451
aVand left the poorer people in the lower cities,
p452
aVabout 10 to 12 percent of the people
p453
aVhave moved to the upper city.
p454
aa(lp455
VNow, where does this upper city and lower city come?
p456
aVThere's a mythology in India about \u2014
p457
aVwhere they say, and I'll say it in Hindi,
p458
aV[Hindi]
p459
aVRight. What does that mean?
p460
aVIt says that the rich are always sitting on the shoulders
p461
aVand survive on the shoulders of the poor.
p462
aVSo, from that mythology, the upper city and lower city come.
p463
aVSo the design has a story.
p464
aa(lp465
VAnd now, what happens is that the people of the upper city,
p466
aVthey suck up all the water.
p467
aVRemember the word I said, suck up.
p468
aVThey suck up all the water, keep to themselves,
p469
aVand they drip feed the lower city.
p470
aVAnd if there's any revolution, they cut off the water.
p471
aVAnd, because democracy still exists,
p472
aVthere's a democratic way in which you say
p473
aV"Well, if you give us what [we want], we'll give you water."
p474
aa(lp475
VSo, okay my time is up.
p476
aVBut I can go on about telling you
p477
aVhow we evolve stories,
p478
aVand how stories effectively are who we are
p479
aVand how these get translated into the particular discipline
p480
aVthat I am in, which is film.
p481
aVBut ultimately, what is a story? It's a contradiction.
p482
aVEverything's a contradiction.
p483
aVThe universe is a contradiction.
p484
aVAnd all of us are constantly looking for harmony.
p485
aVWhen you get up, the night and day is a contradiction.
p486
aVBut you get up at 4 a.m.
p487
aVThat first blush of blue is where the night and day
p488
aVare trying to find harmony with each other.
p489
aVHarmony is the notes that Mozart didn't give you,
p490
aVbut somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that.
p491
aVAll contradictions of his notes suggest the harmony.
p492
aVIt's the effect of looking for harmony
p493
aVin the contradiction that exists in a poet's mind,
p494
aVa contradiction that exists in a storyteller's mind.
p495
aVIn a storyteller's mind, it's a contradiction of moralities.
p496
aVIn a poet's mind, it's a conflict of words,
p497
aVin the universe's mind, between day and night.
p498
aVIn the mind of a man and a woman,
p499
aVwe're looking constantly at
p500
aVthe contradiction between male and female,
p501
aVwe're looking for harmony within each other.
p502
aa(lp503
VThe whole idea of contradiction,
p504
aVbut the acceptance of contradiction
p505
aVis the telling of a story, not the resolution.
p506
aVThe problem with a lot of the storytelling in Hollywood
p507
aVand many films, and as [unclear] was saying in his,
p508
aVthat we try to resolve the contradiction.
p509
aVHarmony is not resolution.
p510
aVHarmony is the suggestion of a thing
p511
aVthat is much larger than resolution.
p512
aVHarmony is the suggestion of something
p513
aVthat is embracing and universal
p514
aVand of eternity and of the moment.
p515
aVResolution is something that is far more limited.
p516
aVIt is finite; harmony is infinite.
p517
aVSo that storytelling, like all other contradictions in the universe,
p518
aVis looking for harmony and infinity
p519
aVin moral resolutions, resolving one, but letting another go,
p520
aVletting another go and creating a question that is really important.
