VIt feels like we're all suffering
p4
aVfrom information overload or data glut.
p5
aVAnd the good news is there might be an easy solution to that,
p6
aVand that's using our eyes more.
p7
aVSo, visualizing information, so that we can see
p8
aVthe patterns and connections that matter
p9
aVand then designing that information so it makes more sense,
p10
aVor it tells a story,
p11
aVor allows us to focus only on the information that's important.
p12
aVFailing that, visualized information can just look really cool.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo, let's see.
p15
aVThis is the $Billion Dollar o-Gram,
p16
aVand this image arose
p17
aVout of frustration I had
p18
aVwith the reporting of billion-dollar amounts in the press.
p19
aVThat is, they're meaningless without context:
p20
aV500 billion for this pipeline,
p21
aV20 billion for this war.
p22
aVIt doesn't make any sense, so the only way to understand it
p23
aVis visually and relatively.
p24
aVSo I scraped a load of reported figures
p25
aVfrom various news outlets
p26
aVand then scaled the boxes according to those amounts.
p27
aVAnd the colors here represent the motivation behind the money.
p28
aVSo purple is "fighting,"
p29
aVand red is "giving money away," and green is "profiteering."
p30
aVAnd what you can see straight away
p31
aVis you start to have a different relationship to the numbers.
p32
aVYou can literally see them.
p33
aVBut more importantly, you start to see
p34
aVpatterns and connections between numbers
p35
aVthat would otherwise be scattered across multiple news reports.
p36
aa(lp37
VLet me point out some that I really like.
p38
aVThis is OPEC's revenue, this green box here \u2014
p39
aV780 billion a year.
p40
aVAnd this little pixel in the corner \u2014 three billion \u2014
p41
aVthat's their climate change fund.
p42
aVAmericans, incredibly generous people \u2014
p43
aVover 300 billion a year, donated to charity every year,
p44
aVcompared with the amount of foreign aid
p45
aVgiven by the top 17 industrialized nations
p46
aVat 120 billion.
p47
aVThen of course,
p48
aVthe Iraq War, predicted to cost just 60 billion
p49
aVback in 2003.
p50
aVAnd it mushroomed slightly. Afghanistan and Iraq mushroomed now
p51
aVto 3,000 billion.
p52
aVSo now it's great
p53
aVbecause now we have this texture, and we can add numbers to it as well.
p54
aVSo we could say, well, a new figure comes out ... let's see African debt.
p55
aVHow much of this diagram do you think might be taken up
p56
aVby the debt that Africa owes to the West?
p57
aVLet's take a look.
p58
aVSo there it is:
p59
aV227 billion is what Africa owes.
p60
aVAnd the recent financial crisis,
p61
aVhow much of this diagram might that figure take up?
p62
aVWhat has that cost the world? Let's take a look at that.
p63
aVDooosh \u2014 Which I think is the appropriate sound effect
p64
aVfor that much money:
p65
aV11,900 billion.
p66
aVSo, by visualizing this information,
p67
aVwe turned it into a landscape
p68
aVthat you can explore with your eyes,
p69
aVa kind of map really, a sort of information map.
p70
aVAnd when you're lost in information,
p71
aVan information map is kind of useful.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo I want to show you another landscape now.
p74
aVWe need to imagine what a landscape
p75
aVof the world's fears might look like.
p76
aVLet's take a look.
p77
aVThis is Mountains Out of Molehills,
p78
aVa timeline of global media panic.
p79
aV(Laughter)
p80
aVSo, I'll label this for you in a second.
p81
aVBut the height here, I want to point out,
p82
aVis the intensity of certain fears
p83
aVas reported in the media.
p84
aVLet me point them out.
p85
aVSo this, swine flu \u2014 pink.
p86
aVBird flu.
p87
aVSARS \u2014 brownish here. Remember that one?
p88
aVThe millennium bug,
p89
aVterrible disaster.
p90
aVThese little green peaks
p91
aVare asteroid collisions.
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aVAnd in summer, here, killer wasps.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughter)
p96
aa(lp97
VSo these are what our fears look like
p98
aVover time in our media.
p99
aVBut what I love \u2014 and I'm a journalist \u2014
p100
aVand what I love is finding hidden patterns; I love being a data detective.
p101
aVAnd there's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data
p102
aVthat you can only see when you visualize it.
p103
aVLet me highlight it for you.
p104
aVSee this line, this is a landscape for violent video games.
p105
aVAs you can see, there's a kind of odd, regular pattern in the data,
p106
aVtwin peaks every year.
p107
aVIf we look closer, we see those peaks occur
p108
aVat the same month every year.
p109
aVWhy?
p110
aVWell, November, Christmas video games come out,
p111
aVand there may well be an upsurge in the concern about their content.
p112
aVBut April isn't a particularly massive month
p113
aVfor video games.
p114
aVWhy April?
p115
aVWell, in April 1999 was the Columbine shooting,
p116
aVand since then, that fear
p117
aVhas been remembered by the media
p118
aVand echoes through the group mind gradually through the year.
p119
aVYou have retrospectives, anniversaries,
p120
aVcourt cases, even copy-cat shootings,
p121
aVall pushing that fear into the agenda.
p122
aVAnd there's another pattern here as well. Can you spot it?
p123
aVSee that gap there? There's a gap,
p124
aVand it affects all the other stories.
p125
aVWhy is there a gap there?
p126
aVYou see where it starts? September 2001,
p127
aVwhen we had something very real
p128
aVto be scared about.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo, I've been working as a data journalist for about a year,
p131
aVand I keep hearing a phrase
p132
aVall the time, which is this:
p133
aV"Data is the new oil."
p134
aVData is the kind of ubiquitous resource
p135
aVthat we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights,
p136
aVand it's all around us, and it can be mined very easily.
p137
aVIt's not a particularly great metaphor in these times,
p138
aVespecially if you live around the Gulf of Mexico,
p139
aVbut I would, perhaps, adapt this metaphor slightly,
p140
aVand I would say that data is the new soil.
p141
aVBecause for me, it feels like a fertile, creative medium.
p142
aVOver the years, online,
p143
aVwe've laid down
p144
aVa huge amount of information and data,
p145
aVand we irrigate it with networks and connectivity,
p146
aVand it's been worked and tilled by unpaid workers and governments.
p147
aVAnd, all right, I'm kind of milking the metaphor a little bit.
p148
aVBut it's a really fertile medium,
p149
aVand it feels like visualizations, infographics, data visualizations,
p150
aVthey feel like flowers blooming from this medium.
p151
aVBut if you look at it directly,
p152
aVit's just a lot of numbers and disconnected facts.
p153
aVBut if you start working with it and playing with it in a certain way,
p154
aVinteresting things can appear and different patterns can be revealed.
p155
aa(lp156
VLet me show you this.
p157
aVCan you guess what this data set is?
p158
aVWhat rises twice a year,
p159
aVonce in Easter
p160
aVand then two weeks before Christmas,
p161
aVhas a mini peak every Monday,
p162
aVand then flattens out over the summer?
p163
aVI'll take answers.
p164
aV(Audience: Chocolate.) David McCandless: Chocolate.
p165
aVYou might want to get some chocolate in.
p166
aVAny other guesses?
p167
aV(Audience: Shopping.) DM: Shopping.
p168
aVYeah, retail therapy might help.
p169
aV(Audience: Sick leave.)
p170
aVDM: Sick leave. Yeah, you'll definitely want to take some time off.
p171
aVShall we see?
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
V(Applause)
p176
aa(lp177
VSo, the information guru Lee Byron and myself,
p178
aVwe scraped 10,000 status Facebook updates
p179
aVfor the phrase "break-up" and "broken-up"
p180
aVand this is the pattern we found \u2014
p181
aVpeople clearing out for Spring Break,
p182
aV(Laughter)
p183
aVcoming out of very bad weekends on a Monday,
p184
aVbeing single over the summer,
p185
aVand then the lowest day of the year, of course: Christmas Day.
p186
aVWho would do that?
p187
aVSo there's a titanic amount of data out there now,
p188
aVunprecedented.
p189
aVBut if you ask the right kind of question,
p190
aVor you work it in the right kind of way,
p191
aVinteresting things can emerge.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo information is beautiful. Data is beautiful.
p194
aVI wonder if I could make my life beautiful.
p195
aVAnd here's my visual C.V.
p196
aVI'm not quite sure I've succeeded.
p197
aVPretty blocky, the colors aren't that great.
p198
aVBut I wanted to convey something to you.
p199
aVI started as a programmer,
p200
aVand then I worked as a writer for many years, about 20 years,
p201
aVin print, online and then in advertising,
p202
aVand only recently have I started designing.
p203
aVAnd I've never been to design school.
p204
aVI've never studied art or anything.
p205
aVI just kind of learned through doing.
p206
aVAnd when I started designing,
p207
aVI discovered an odd thing about myself.
p208
aVI already knew how to design,
p209
aVbut it wasn't like I was amazingly brilliant at it,
p210
aVbut more like I was sensitive
p211
aVto the ideas of grids and space
p212
aVand alignment and typography.
p213
aVIt's almost like being exposed
p214
aVto all this media over the years
p215
aVhad instilled a kind of dormant design literacy in me.
p216
aVAnd I don't feel like I'm unique.
p217
aa(lp218
VI feel that everyday, all of us now
p219
aVare being blasted by information design.
p220
aVIt's being poured into our eyes through the Web,
p221
aVand we're all visualizers now;
p222
aVwe're all demanding a visual aspect
p223
aVto our information.
p224
aVThere's something almost quite magical about visual information.
p225
aVIt's effortless, it literally pours in.
p226
aVAnd if you're navigating a dense information jungle,
p227
aVcoming across a beautiful graphic
p228
aVor a lovely data visualization,
p229
aVit's a relief, it's like coming across a clearing in the jungle.
p230
aVI was curious about this, so it led me
p231
aVto the work of a Danish physicist
p232
aVcalled Tor Norretranders,
p233
aVand he converted the bandwidth of the senses into computer terms.
p234
aa(lp235
VSo here we go. This is your senses,
p236
aVpouring into your senses every second.
p237
aVYour sense of sight is the fastest.
p238
aVIt has the same bandwidth as a computer network.
p239
aVThen you have touch, which is about the speed of a USB key.
p240
aVAnd then you have hearing and smell,
p241
aVwhich has the throughput of a hard disk.
p242
aVAnd then you have poor old taste,
p243
aVwhich is like barely the throughput of a pocket calculator.
p244
aVAnd that little square in the corner, a naught .7 percent,
p245
aVthat's the amount we're actually aware of.
p246
aVSo a lot of your vision \u2014
p247
aVthe bulk of it is visual, and it's pouring in.
p248
aVIt's unconscious.
p249
aVThe eye is exquisitely sensitive
p250
aVto patterns in variations in color, shape and pattern.
p251
aVIt loves them, and it calls them beautiful.
p252
aVIt's the language of the eye.
p253
aVIf you combine the language of the eye with the language of the mind,
p254
aVwhich is about words and numbers and concepts,
p255
aVyou start speaking two languages simultaneously,
p256
aVeach enhancing the other.
p257
aVSo, you have the eye, and then you drop in the concepts.
p258
aVAnd that whole thing \u2014 it's two languages
p259
aVboth working at the same time.
p260
aa(lp261
VSo we can use this new kind of language, if you like,
p262
aVto alter our perspective or change our views.
p263
aVLet me ask you a simple question
p264
aVwith a really simple answer:
p265
aVWho has the biggest military budget?
p266
aVIt's got to be America, right?
p267
aVMassive. 609 billion in 2008 \u2014
p268
aV607, rather.
p269
aVSo massive, in fact, that it can contain
p270
aVall the other military budgets in the world inside itself.
p271
aVGobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.
p272
aVNow, you can see Africa's total debt there
p273
aVand the U.K. budget deficit for reference.
p274
aVSo that might well chime
p275
aVwith your view that America
p276
aVis a sort of warmongering military machine,
p277
aVout to overpower the world
p278
aVwith its huge industrial-military complex.
p279
aVBut is it true that America has the biggest military budget?
p280
aVBecause America is an incredibly rich country.
p281
aVIn fact, it's so massively rich
p282
aVthat it can contain the four other
p283
aVtop industrialized nations' economies
p284
aVinside itself, it's so vastly rich.
p285
aVSo its military budget is bound to be enormous.
p286
aVSo, to be fair and to alter our perspective,
p287
aVwe have to bring in another data set,
p288
aVand that data set is GDP, or the country's earnings.
p289
aVWho has the biggest budget as a proportion of GDP?
p290
aVLet's have a look.
p291
aVThat changes the picture considerably.
p292
aVOther countries pop into view that you, perhaps, weren't considering,
p293
aVand American drops into eighth.
p294
aa(lp295
VNow you can also do this with soldiers.
p296
aVWho has the most soldiers? It's got to be China.
p297
aVOf course, 2.1 million.
p298
aVAgain, chiming with your view
p299
aVthat China has a militarized regime
p300
aVready to, you know, mobilize its enormous forces.
p301
aVBut of course, China has an enormous population.
p302
aVSo if we do the same,
p303
aVwe see a radically different picture.
p304
aVChina drops to 124th.
p305
aVIt actually has a tiny army
p306
aVwhen you take other data into consideration.
p307
aVSo, absolute figures, like the military budget,
p308
aVin a connected world,
p309
aVdon't give you the whole picture.
p310
aVThey're not as true as they could be.
p311
aa(lp312
VWe need relative figures that are connected to other data
p313
aVso that we can see a fuller picture,
p314
aVand then that can lead to us changing our perspective.
p315
aVAs Hans Rosling, the master,
p316
aVmy master, said,
p317
aV"Let the dataset change your mindset."
p318
aVAnd if it can do that, maybe it can also change your behavior.
p319
aa(lp320
VTake a look at this one.
p321
aVI'm a bit of a health nut.
p322
aVI love taking supplements and being fit,
p323
aVbut I can never understand what's going on in terms of evidence.
p324
aVThere's always conflicting evidence.
p325
aVShould I take vitamin C? Should I be taking wheatgrass?
p326
aVThis is a visualization of all the evidence
p327
aVfor nutritional supplements.
p328
aVThis kind of diagram is called a balloon race.
p329
aVSo the higher up the image,
p330
aVthe more evidence there is for each supplement.
p331
aVAnd the bubbles correspond to popularity as regards to Google hits.
p332
aVSo you can immediately apprehend
p333
aVthe relationship between efficacy and popularity,
p334
aVbut you can also, if you grade the evidence,
p335
aVdo a "worth it" line.
p336
aVSo supplements above this line are worth investigating,
p337
aVbut only for the conditions listed below,
p338
aVand then the supplements below the line
p339
aVare perhaps not worth investigating.
p340
aa(lp341
VNow this image constitutes a huge amount of work.
p342
aVWe scraped like 1,000 studies from PubMed,
p343
aVthe biomedical database,
p344
aVand we compiled them and graded them all.
p345
aVAnd it was incredibly frustrating for me
p346
aVbecause I had a book of 250 visualizations to do for my book,
p347
aVand I spent a month doing this,
p348
aVand I only filled two pages.
p349
aVBut what it points to
p350
aVis that visualizing information like this
p351
aVis a form of knowledge compression.
p352
aVIt's a way of squeezing an enormous amount
p353
aVof information and understanding
p354
aVinto a small space.
p355
aVAnd once you've curated that data, and once you've cleaned that data,
p356
aVand once it's there,
p357
aVyou can do cool stuff like this.
p358
aa(lp359
VSo I converted this into an interactive app,
p360
aVso I can now generate this application online \u2014
p361
aVthis is the visualization online \u2014
p362
aVand I can say, "Yeah, brilliant."
p363
aVSo it spawns itself.
p364
aVAnd then I can say, "Well, just show me the stuff
p365
aVthat affects heart health."
p366
aVSo let's filter that out.
p367
aVSo heart is filtered out, so I can see if I'm curious about that.
p368
aVI think, "No, no. I don't want to take any synthetics,
p369
aVI just want to see plants and \u2014
p370
aVjust show me herbs and plants. I've got all the natural ingredients."
p371
aVNow this app is spawning itself
p372
aVfrom the data.
p373
aVThe data is all stored in a Google Doc,
p374
aVand it's literally generating itself from that data.
p375
aVSo the data is now alive; this is a living image,
p376
aVand I can update it in a second.
p377
aVNew evidence comes out. I just change a row on a spreadsheet.
p378
aVDoosh! Again, the image recreates itself.
p379
aVSo it's cool.
p380
aVIt's kind of living.
p381
aa(lp382
VBut it can go beyond data,
p383
aVand it can go beyond numbers.
p384
aVI like to apply information visualization
p385
aVto ideas and concepts.
p386
aVThis is a visualization
p387
aVof the political spectrum,
p388
aVan attempt for me to try
p389
aVand understand how it works
p390
aVand how the ideas percolate down
p391
aVfrom government into society and culture,
p392
aVinto families, into individuals, into their beliefs
p393
aVand back around again in a cycle.
p394
aVWhat I love about this image
p395
aVis it's made up of concepts,
p396
aVit explores our worldviews
p397
aVand it helps us \u2014 it helps me anyway \u2014
p398
aVto see what others think,
p399
aVto see where they're coming from.
p400
aVAnd it feels just incredibly cool to do that.
p401
aa(lp402
VWhat was most exciting for me
p403
aVdesigning this
p404
aVwas that, when I was designing this image,
p405
aVI desperately wanted this side, the left side,
p406
aVto be better than the right side \u2014
p407
aVbeing a journalist, a Left-leaning person \u2014
p408
aVbut I couldn't, because I would have created
p409
aVa lopsided, biased diagram.
p410
aVSo, in order to really create a full image,
p411
aVI had to honor the perspectives on the right-hand side
p412
aVand at the same time, uncomfortably recognize
p413
aVhow many of those qualities were actually in me,
p414
aVwhich was very, very annoying and uncomfortable.
p415
aV(Laughter)
p416
aVBut not too uncomfortable,
p417
aVbecause there's something unthreatening
p418
aVabout seeing a political perspective,
p419
aVversus being told or forced to listen to one.
p420
aVYou're capable of holding conflicting viewpoints
p421
aVjoyously when you can see them.
p422
aVIt's even fun to engage with them
p423
aVbecause it's visual.
p424
aVSo that's what's exciting to me,
p425
aVseeing how data can change my perspective
p426
aVand change my mind midstream \u2014
p427
aVbeautiful, lovely data.
p428
aa(lp429
VSo, just to wrap up,
p430
aVI wanted to say
p431
aVthat it feels to me that design is about solving problems
p432
aVand providing elegant solutions,
p433
aVand information design is about
p434
aVsolving information problems.
p435
aVIt feels like we have a lot of information problems
p436
aVin our society at the moment,
p437
aVfrom the overload and the saturation
p438
aVto the breakdown of trust and reliability
p439
aVand runaway skepticism and lack of transparency,
p440
aVor even just interestingness.
p441
aVI mean, I find information just too interesting.
p442
aVIt has a magnetic quality that draws me in.
p443
aa(lp444
VSo, visualizing information
p445
aVcan give us a very quick solution to those kinds of problems.
p446
aVEven when the information is terrible,
p447
aVthe visual can be quite beautiful.
p448
aVOften we can get clarity
p449
aVor the answer to a simple question very quickly,
p450
aVlike this one,
p451
aVthe recent Icelandic volcano.
p452
aVWhich was emitting the most CO2?
p453
aVWas it the planes or the volcano,
p454
aVthe grounded planes or the volcano?
p455
aVSo we can have a look.
p456
aVWe look at the data and we see:
p457
