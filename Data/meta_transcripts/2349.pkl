VWe all go to doctors.
p4
aVAnd we do so with trust and blind faith
p5
aVthat the test they are ordering and the medications they're prescribing
p6
aVare based upon evidence \u2014
p7
aVevidence that's designed to help us.
p8
aVHowever, the reality is that that hasn't always been the case for everyone.
p9
aVWhat if I told you
p10
aVthat the medical science discovered over the past century
p11
aVhas been based on only half the population?
p12
aa(lp13
VI'm an emergency medicine doctor.
p14
aVI was trained to be prepared in a medical emergency.
p15
aVIt's about saving lives. How cool is that?
p16
aVOK, there's a lot of runny noses and stubbed toes,
p17
aVbut no matter who walks through the door to the ER,
p18
aVwe order the same tests,
p19
aVwe prescribe the same medication,
p20
aVwithout ever thinking about the sex or gender of our patients.
p21
aVWhy would we?
p22
aVWe were never taught that there were any differences between men and women.
p23
aa(lp24
VA recent Government Accountability study revealed that 80 percent of the drugs
p25
aVwithdrawn from the market
p26
aVare due to side effects on women.
p27
aVSo let's think about that for a minute.
p28
aVWhy are we discovering side effects on women
p29
aVonly after a drug has been released to the market?
p30
aVDo you know that it takes years for a drug to go from an idea
p31
aVto being tested on cells in a laboratory,
p32
aVto animal studies,
p33
aVto then clinical trials on humans,
p34
aVfinally to go through a regulatory approval process,
p35
aVto be available for your doctor to prescribe to you?
p36
aVNot to mention the millions and billions of dollars of funding
p37
aVit takes to go through that process.
p38
aVSo why are we discovering unacceptable side effects
p39
aVon half the population after that has gone through?
p40
aVWhat's happening?
p41
aa(lp42
VWell, it turns out that those cells used in that laboratory,
p43
aVthey're male cells,
p44
aVand the animals used in the animal studies were male animals,
p45
aVand the clinical trials have been performed almost exclusively on men.
p46
aa(lp47
VHow is it that the male model became our framework for medical research?
p48
aVLet's look at an example that has been popularized in the media,
p49
aVand it has to do with the sleep aid Ambien.
p50
aVAmbien was released on the market over 20 years ago,
p51
aVand since then, hundreds of millions of prescriptions have been written,
p52
aVprimarily to women, because women suffer more sleep disorders than men.
p53
aVBut just this past year,
p54
aVthe Food and Drug Administration recommended cutting the dose in half
p55
aVfor women only,
p56
aVbecause they just realized that women metabolize the drug
p57
aVat a slower rate than men,
p58
aVcausing them to wake up in the morning
p59
aVwith more of the active drug in their system.
p60
aVAnd then they're drowsy and they're getting behind the wheel of the car,
p61
aVand they're at risk for motor vehicle accidents.
p62
aVAnd I can't help but think, as an emergency physician,
p63
aVhow many of my patients that I've cared for over the years
p64
aVwere involved in a motor vehicle accident
p65
aVthat possibly could have been prevented
p66
aVif this type of analysis was performed and acted upon 20 years ago
p67
aVwhen this drug was first released.
p68
aVHow many other things need to be analyzed by gender?
p69
aVWhat else are we missing?
p70
aa(lp71
VWorld War II changed a lot of things,
p72
aVand one of them was this need to protect people
p73
aVfrom becoming victims of medical research without informed consent.
p74
aVSo some much-needed guidelines or rules were set into place,
p75
aVand part of that was this desire to protect women of childbearing age
p76
aVfrom entering into any medical research studies.
p77
aVThere was fear: what if something happened to the fetus during the study?
p78
aVWho would be responsible?
p79
aVAnd so the scientists at this time actually thought
p80
aVthis was a blessing in disguise,
p81
aVbecause let's face it \u2014 men's bodies are pretty homogeneous.
p82
aVThey don't have the constantly fluctuating levels of hormones
p83
aVthat could disrupt clean data they could get if they had only men.
p84
aVIt was easier. It was cheaper.
p85
aVNot to mention, at this time, there was a general assumption
p86
aVthat men and women were alike in every way,
p87
aVapart from their reproductive organs and sex hormones.
p88
aVSo it was decided:
p89
aVmedical research was performed on men,
p90
aVand the results were later applied to women.
p91
aa(lp92
VWhat did this do to the notion of women's health?
p93
aVWomen's health became synonymous with reproduction:
p94
aVbreasts, ovaries, uterus, pregnancy.
p95
aVIt's this term we now refer to as "bikini medicine."
p96
aVAnd this stayed this way until about the 1980s,
p97
aVwhen this concept was challenged by the medical community
p98
aVand by the public health policymakers when they realized that
p99
aVby excluding women from all medical research studies
p100
aVwe actually did them a disservice,
p101
aVin that apart from reproductive issues,
p102
aVvirtually nothing was known about the unique needs
p103
aVof the female patient.
p104
aa(lp105
VSince that time, an overwhelming amount of evidence has come to light
p106
aVthat shows us just how different men and women are in every way.
p107
aVYou know, we have this saying in medicine:
p108
aVchildren are not just little adults.
p109
aVAnd we say that to remind ourselves
p110
aVthat children actually have a different physiology than normal adults.
p111
aVAnd it's because of this that the medical specialty of pediatrics came to light.
p112
aVAnd we now conduct research on children in order to improve their lives.
p113
aVAnd I know the same thing can be said about women.
p114
aVWomen are not just men with boobs and tubes.
p115
aVBut they have their own anatomy and physiology
p116
aVthat deserves to be studied with the same intensity.
p117
aa(lp118
VLet's take the cardiovascular system, for example.
p119
aVThis area in medicine has done the most to try to figure out
p120
aVwhy it seems men and women have completely different heart attacks.
p121
aVHeart disease is the number one killer for both men and women,
p122
aVbut more women die within the first year of having a heart attack than men.
p123
aVMen will complain of crushing chest pain \u2014
p124
aVan elephant is sitting on their chest.
p125
aVAnd we call this typical.
p126
aVWomen have chest pain, too.
p127
aVBut more women than men will complain of "just not feeling right,"
p128
aV"can't seem to get enough air in,"
p129
aV"just so tired lately."
p130
aVAnd for some reason we call this atypical,
p131
aVeven though, as I mentioned, women do make up half the population.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd so what is some of the evidence to help explain some of these differences?
p134
aVIf we look at the anatomy,
p135
aVthe blood vessels that surround the heart are smaller in women compared to men,
p136
aVand the way that those blood vessels develop disease is different
p137
aVin women compared to men.
p138
aVAnd the test that we use to determine if someone is at risk for a heart attack,
p139
aVwell, they were initially designed and tested and perfected in men,
p140
aVand so aren't as good at determining that in women.
p141
aVAnd then if we think about the medications \u2014
p142
aVcommon medications that we use, like aspirin.
p143
aVWe give aspirin to healthy men to help prevent them from having a heart attack,
p144
aVbut do you know that if you give aspirin to a healthy woman,
p145
aVit's actually harmful?
p146
aa(lp147
VWhat this is doing is merely telling us
p148
aVthat we are scratching the surface.
p149
aVEmergency medicine is a fast-paced business.
p150
aVIn how many life-saving areas of medicine,
p151
aVlike cancer and stroke,
p152
aVare there important differences between men and women that we could be utilizing?
p153
aVOr even, why is it that some people get those runny noses
p154
aVmore than others,
p155
aVor why the pain medication that we give to those stubbed toes
p156
aVwork in some and not in others?
p157
aa(lp158
VThe Institute of Medicine has said every cell has a sex.
p159
aVWhat does this mean?
p160
aVSex is DNA.
p161
aVGender is how someone presents themselves in society.
p162
aVAnd these two may not always match up,
p163
aVas we can see with our transgendered population.
p164
aVBut it's important to realize that from the moment of conception,
p165
aVevery cell in our bodies \u2014
p166
aVskin, hair, heart and lungs \u2014
p167
aVcontains our own unique DNA,
p168
aVand that DNA contains the chromosomes that determine
p169
aVwhether we become male or female, man or woman.
p170
aa(lp171
VIt used to be thought
p172
aVthat those sex-determining chromosomes pictured here \u2014
p173
aVXY if you're male, XX if you're female \u2014
p174
aVmerely determined whether you would be born with ovaries or testes,
p175
aVand it was the sex hormones that those organs produced
p176
aVthat were responsible for the differences we see in the opposite sex.
p177
aVBut we now know that that theory was wrong \u2014
p178
aVor it's at least a little incomplete.
p179
aVAnd thankfully, scientists like Dr. Page from the Whitehead Institute,
p180
aVwho works on the Y chromosome,
p181
aVand Doctor Yang from UCLA,
p182
aVthey have found evidence that tells us that those sex-determining chromosomes
p183
aVthat are in every cell in our bodies
p184
aVcontinue to remain active for our entire lives
p185
aVand could be what's responsible for the differences we see
p186
aVin the dosing of drugs,
p187
aVor why there are differences between men and women
p188
aVin the susceptibility and severity of diseases.
p189
aVThis new knowledge is the game-changer,
p190
aVand it's up to those scientists that continue to find that evidence,
p191
aVbut it's up to the clinicians to start translating this data
p192
aVat the bedside, today.
p193
aVRight now.
p194
aVAnd to help do this, I'm a co-founder of a national organization
p195
aVcalled Sex and Gender Women's Health Collaborative,
p196
aVand we collect all of this data so that it's available for teaching
p197
aVand for patient care.
p198
aVAnd we're working to bring together the medical educators to the table.
p199
aVThat's a big job.
p200
aVIt's changing the way medical training has been done since its inception.
p201
aa(lp202
VBut I believe in them.
p203
aVI know they're going to see the value of incorporating the gender lens
p204
aVinto the current curriculum.
p205
aVIt's about training the future health care providers correctly.
p206
aVAnd regionally,
p207
aVI'm a co-creator of a division within the Department of Emergency Medicine
p208
aVhere at Brown University,
p209
aVcalled Sex and Gender in Emergency Medicine,
p210
aVand we conduct the research to determine the differences between men and women
p211
aVin emergent conditions,
p212
aVlike heart disease and stroke and sepsis and substance abuse,
p213
aVbut we also believe that education is paramount.
p214
aa(lp215
VWe've created a 360-degree model of education.
p216
aVWe have programs for the doctors, for the nurses, for the students
p217
aVand for the patients.
p218
aVBecause this cannot just be left up to the health care leaders.
p219
aVWe all have a role in making a difference.
p220
aVBut I must warn you: this is not easy.
p221
aVIn fact, it's hard.
p222
aVIt's essentially changing the way we think about medicine
p223
aVand health and research.
p224
aVIt's changing our relationship to the health care system.
p225
aVBut there's no going back.
p226
aVWe now know just enough
p227
aVto know that we weren't doing it right.
p228
aa(lp229
VMartin Luther King, Jr. has said,
p230
aV"Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability,
p231
aVbut comes through continuous struggle."
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd the first step towards change is awareness.
p234
aVThis is not just about improving medical care for women.
p235
aVThis is about personalized, individualized health care for everyone.
p236
aVThis awareness has the power to transform medical care for men and women.
p237
aVAnd from now on, I want you to ask your doctors
p238
aVwhether the treatments you are receiving are specific to your sex and gender.
p239
aVThey may not know the answer \u2014
p240
aVyet.
p241
aVBut the conversation has begun, and together we can all learn.
p242
aVRemember, for me and my colleagues in this field,
p243
aVyour sex and gender matter.
p244
aa(lp245
VThank you.
