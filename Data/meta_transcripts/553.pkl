VI'm here because I have a very important message:
p4
aVI think we have found
p5
aVthe most important factor for success.
p6
aVAnd it was found close to here, Stanford.
p7
aVPsychology professor took kids that were four years old
p8
aVand put them in a room all by themselves.
p9
aVAnd he would tell the child, a four-year-old kid,
p10
aV"Johnny, I am going to leave you here with a marshmallow
p11
aVfor 15 minutes.
p12
aVIf, after I come back, this marshmallow is here,
p13
aVyou will get another one. So you will have two."
p14
aVTo tell a four-year-old kid to wait 15 minutes
p15
aVfor something that they like,
p16
aVis equivalent to telling us, "We'll bring you coffee in two hours."
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aVExact equivalent.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo what happened when the professor left the room?
p21
aVAs soon as the door closed...
p22
aVtwo out of three ate the marshmallow.
p23
aVFive seconds, 10 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds,
p24
aVtwo minutes, four minutes, eight minutes.
p25
aVSome lasted 14-and-a-half minutes.
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aVCouldn't do it. Could not wait.
p28
aVWhat's interesting is that one out of three
p29
aVwould look at the marshmallow and go like this ...
p30
aVWould look at it.
p31
aVPut it back.
p32
aVThey would walk around. They would play with their skirts and pants.
p33
aa(lp34
VThat child already, at four, understood
p35
aVthe most important principle for success,
p36
aVwhich is the ability to delay gratification.
p37
aVSelf-discipline:
p38
aVthe most important factor for success.
p39
aV15 years later, 14 or 15 years later,
p40
aVfollow-up study.
p41
aVWhat did they find?
p42
aVThey went to look for these kids who were now 18 and 19.
p43
aVAnd they found that 100 percent
p44
aVof the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful.
p45
aVThey had good grades. They were doing wonderful.
p46
aVThey were happy. They had their plans.
p47
aVThey had good relationships with the teachers, students.
p48
aVThey were doing fine.
p49
aa(lp50
VA great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow,
p51
aVthey were in trouble.
p52
aVThey did not make it to university.
p53
aVThey had bad grades. Some of them dropped out.
p54
aVA few were still there with bad grades.
p55
aVA few had good grades.
p56
aa(lp57
VI had a question in my mind: Would Hispanic kids
p58
aVreact the same way as the American kids?
p59
aVSo I went to Colombia. And I reproduced the experiment.
p60
aVAnd it was very funny. I used four, five and six years old kids.
p61
aVAnd let me show you what happened.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Spanish) (Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VSo what happened in Colombia?
p66
aVHispanic kids, two out of three ate the marshmallow;
p67
aVone out of three did not.
p68
aVThis little girl was interesting;
p69
aVshe ate the inside of the marshmallow.
p70
aV(Laughter)
p71
aVIn other words, she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it, so she would get two.
p72
aVBut she ate it.
p73
aVSo we know she'll be successful. But we have to watch her.
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aVShe should not go into banking, for example,
p76
aVor work at a cash register.
p77
aVBut she will be successful.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd this applies for everything. Even in sales.
p80
aVThe sales person that \u2014
p81
aVthe customer says, "I want that." And the person says, "Okay, here you are."
p82
aVThat person ate the marshmallow.
p83
aVIf the sales person says, "Wait a second.
p84
aVLet me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice."
p85
aVThen you sell a lot more.
p86
aVSo this has applications in all walks of life.
p87
aa(lp88
VI end with \u2014 the Koreans did this.
p89
aVYou know what? This is so good
p90
aVthat we want a marshmallow book for children.
p91
aVWe did one for children. And now it is all over Korea.
p92
aVThey are teaching these kids exactly this principle.
p93
aVAnd we need to learn that principle here in the States,
p94
aVbecause we have a big debt.
p95
aVWe are eating more marshmallows than we are producing.
p96
aVThank you so much.
