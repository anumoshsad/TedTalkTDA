VThe night before I was heading for Scotland,
p4
aVI was invited to host the final
p5
aVof "China's Got Talent" show in Shanghai
p6
aVwith the 80,000 live audience in the stadium.
p7
aVGuess who was the performing guest?
p8
aVSusan Boyle.
p9
aVAnd I told her, "I'm going to Scotland the next day."
p10
aVShe sang beautifully,
p11
aVand she even managed to say a few words in Chinese:
p12
aV\u9001\u4f60\u8471
p13
aVSo it's not like "hello" or "thank you,"
p14
aVthat ordinary stuff.
p15
aVIt means "green onion for free."
p16
aVWhy did she say that?
p17
aVBecause it was a line
p18
aVfrom our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle \u2014
p19
aVa 50-some year-old woman,
p20
aVa vegetable vendor in Shanghai,
p21
aVwho loves singing Western opera,
p22
aVbut she didn't understand
p23
aVany English or French or Italian,
p24
aVso she managed to fill in the lyrics
p25
aVwith vegetable names in Chinese.
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aVAnd the last sentence of Nessun Dorma
p28
aVthat she was singing in the stadium
p29
aVwas "green onion for free."
p30
aVSo [as] Susan Boyle was saying that,
p31
aV80,000 live audience sang together.
p32
aVThat was hilarious.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo I guess both Susan Boyle
p35
aVand this vegetable vendor in Shanghai
p36
aVbelonged to otherness.
p37
aVThey were the least expected to be successful
p38
aVin the business called entertainment,
p39
aVyet their courage and talent brought them through.
p40
aVAnd a show and a platform
p41
aVgave them the stage
p42
aVto realize their dreams.
p43
aVWell, being different is not that difficult.
p44
aVWe are all different
p45
aVfrom different perspectives.
p46
aVBut I think being different is good,
p47
aVbecause you present a different point of view.
p48
aVYou may have the chance to make a difference.
p49
aa(lp50
VMy generation has been very fortunate
p51
aVto witness and participate
p52
aVin the historic transformation of China
p53
aVthat has made so many changes
p54
aVin the past 20, 30 years.
p55
aVI remember that in the year of 1990,
p56
aVwhen I was graduating from college,
p57
aVI was applying for a job in the sales department
p58
aVof the first five-star hotel in Beijing,
p59
aVGreat Wall Sheraton \u2014 it's still there.
p60
aVSo after being interrogated
p61
aVby this Japanese manager for a half an hour,
p62
aVhe finally said,
p63
aV"So, Miss Yang,
p64
aVdo you have any questions to ask me?"
p65
aVI summoned my courage and poise and said,
p66
aV"Yes, but could you let me know,
p67
aVwhat actually do you sell?"
p68
aVI didn't have a clue what a sales department was about
p69
aVin a five-star hotel.
p70
aVThat was the first day I set my foot
p71
aVin a five-star hotel.
p72
aa(lp73
VAround the same time,
p74
aVI was going through an audition \u2014
p75
aVthe first ever open audition
p76
aVby national television in China \u2014
p77
aVwith another thousand college girls.
p78
aVThe producer told us
p79
aVthey were looking for some sweet, innocent
p80
aVand beautiful fresh face.
p81
aVSo when it was my turn, I stood up and said,
p82
aV"Why [do] women's personalities on television
p83
aValways have to be beautiful, sweet, innocent
p84
aVand, you know, supportive?
p85
aVWhy can't they have their own ideas
p86
aVand their own voice?"
p87
aVI thought I kind of offended them.
p88
aVBut actually, they were impressed by my words.
p89
aVAnd so I was in the second round of competition,
p90
aVand then the third and the fourth.
p91
aVAfter seven rounds of competition,
p92
aVI was the last one to survive it.
p93
aVSo I was on a national television prime-time show.
p94
aVAnd believe it or not,
p95
aVthat was the first show on Chinese television
p96
aVthat allowed its hosts
p97
aVto speak out of their own minds
p98
aVwithout reading an approved script.
p99
aV(Applause)
p100
aVAnd my weekly audience at that time
p101
aVwas between 200 to 300 million people.
p102
aa(lp103
VWell after a few years,
p104
aVI decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University
p105
aVto pursue my postgraduate studies,
p106
aVand then started my own media company,
p107
aVwhich was unthought of
p108
aVduring the years that I started my career.
p109
aVSo we do a lot of things.
p110
aVI've interviewed more than a thousand people in the past.
p111
aVAnd sometimes I have young people approaching me
p112
aVsay, "Lan, you changed my life,"
p113
aVand I feel proud of that.
p114
aVBut then we are also so fortunate
p115
aVto witness the transformation of the whole country.
p116
aVI was in Beijing's bidding for the Olympic Games.
p117
aVI was representing the Shanghai Expo.
p118
aVI saw China embracing the world
p119
aVand vice versa.
p120
aVBut then sometimes I'm thinking,
p121
aVwhat are today's young generation up to?
p122
aVHow are they different,
p123
aVand what are the differences they are going to make
p124
aVto shape the future of China,
p125
aVor at large, the world?
p126
aa(lp127
VSo today I want to talk about young people
p128
aVthrough the platform of social media.
p129
aVFirst of all, who are they? [What] do they look like?
p130
aVWell this is a girl called Guo Meimei \u2014
p131
aV20 years old, beautiful.
p132
aVShe showed off her expensive bags,
p133
aVclothes and car
p134
aVon her microblog,
p135
aVwhich is the Chinese version of Twitter.
p136
aVAnd she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross
p137
aVat the Chamber of Commerce.
p138
aVShe didn't realize
p139
aVthat she stepped on a sensitive nerve
p140
aVand aroused national questioning,
p141
aValmost a turmoil,
p142
aVagainst the credibility of Red Cross.
p143
aVThe controversy was so heated
p144
aVthat the Red Cross had to open a press conference
p145
aVto clarify it,
p146
aVand the investigation is going on.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo far, as of today,
p149
aVwe know that she herself made up that title \u2014
p150
aVprobably because she feels proud to be associated with charity.
p151
aVAll those expensive items
p152
aVwere given to her as gifts
p153
aVby her boyfriend,
p154
aVwho used to be a board member
p155
aVin a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce.
p156
aVIt's very complicated to explain.
p157
aVBut anyway, the public still doesn't buy it.
p158
aVIt is still boiling.
p159
aVIt shows us a general mistrust
p160
aVof government or government-backed institutions,
p161
aVwhich lacked transparency in the past.
p162
aVAnd also it showed us
p163
aVthe power and the impact of social media
p164
aVas microblog.
p165
aa(lp166
VMicroblog boomed in the year of 2010,
p167
aVwith visitors doubled
p168
aVand time spent on it tripled.
p169
aVSina.com, a major news portal,
p170
aValone has more than 140 million microbloggers.
p171
aVOn Tencent, 200 million.
p172
aVThe most popular blogger \u2014
p173
aVit's not me \u2014
p174
aVit's a movie star,
p175
aVand she has more than 9.5 million followers, or fans.
p176
aVAbout 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people,
p177
aVunder 30 years old.
p178
aVAnd because, as you know,
p179
aVthe traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government,
p180
aVsocial media offers an opening
p181
aVto let the steam out a little bit.
p182
aVBut because you don't have many other openings,
p183
aVthe heat coming out of this opening
p184
aVis sometimes very strong, active
p185
aVand even violent.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo through microblogging,
p188
aVwe are able to understand Chinese youth even better.
p189
aVSo how are they different?
p190
aVFirst of all, most of them were born
p191
aVin the 80s and 90s,
p192
aVunder the one-child policy.
p193
aVAnd because of selected abortion
p194
aVby families who favored boys to girls,
p195
aVnow we have ended up
p196
aVwith 30 million more young men than women.
p197
aVThat could pose
p198
aVa potential danger to the society,
p199
aVbut who knows;
p200
aVwe're in a globalized world,
p201
aVso they can look for girlfriends from other countries.
p202
aVMost of them have fairly good education.
p203
aVThe illiteracy rate in China among this generation
p204
aVis under one percent.
p205
aVIn cities, 80 percent of kids go to college.
p206
aVBut they are facing an aging China
p207
aVwith a population above 65 years old
p208
aVcoming up with seven-point-some percent this year,
p209
aVand about to be 15 percent
p210
aVby the year of 2030.
p211
aVAnd you know we have the tradition
p212
aVthat younger generations support the elders financially,
p213
aVand taking care of them when they're sick.
p214
aVSo it means young couples
p215
aVwill have to support four parents
p216
aVwho have a life expectancy of 73 years old.
p217
aa(lp218
VSo making a living is not that easy
p219
aVfor young people.
p220
aVCollege graduates are not in short supply.
p221
aVIn urban areas,
p222
aVcollege graduates find the starting salary
p223
aVis about 400 U.S. dollars a month,
p224
aVwhile the average rent
p225
aVis above $500.
p226
aVSo what do they do? They have to share space \u2014
p227
aVsqueezed in very limited space
p228
aVto save money \u2014
p229
aVand they call themselves "tribe of ants."
p230
aVAnd for those who are ready to get married
p231
aVand buy their apartment,
p232
aVthey figured out they have to work
p233
aVfor 30 to 40 years
p234
aVto afford their first apartment.
p235
aVThat ratio in America
p236
aVwould only cost a couple five years to earn,
p237
aVbut in China it's 30 to 40 years
p238
aVwith the skyrocketing real estate price.
p239
aa(lp240
VAmong the 200 million migrant workers,
p241
aV60 percent of them are young people.
p242
aVThey find themselves sort of sandwiched
p243
aVbetween the urban areas and the rural areas.
p244
aVMost of them don't want to go back to the countryside,
p245
aVbut they don't have the sense of belonging.
p246
aVThey work for longer hours
p247
aVwith less income, less social welfare.
p248
aVAnd they're more vulnerable
p249
aVto job losses,
p250
aVsubject to inflation,
p251
aVtightening loans from banks,
p252
aVappreciation of the renminbi,
p253
aVor decline of demand
p254
aVfrom Europe or America
p255
aVfor the products they produce.
p256
aVLast year, though,
p257
aVan appalling incident
p258
aVin a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China:
p259
aV13 young workers
p260
aVin their late teens and early 20s
p261
aVcommitted suicide,
p262
aVjust one by one like causing a contagious disease.
p263
aVBut they died because of all different personal reasons.
p264
aVBut this whole incident
p265
aVaroused a huge outcry from society
p266
aVabout the isolation,
p267
aVboth physical and mental,
p268
aVof these migrant workers.
p269
aa(lp270
VFor those who do return back to the countryside,
p271
aVthey find themselves very welcome locally,
p272
aVbecause with the knowledge, skills and networks
p273
aVthey have learned in the cities,
p274
aVwith the assistance of the Internet,
p275
aVthey're able to create more jobs,
p276
aVupgrade local agriculture and create new business
p277
aVin the less developed market.
p278
aVSo for the past few years, the coastal areas,
p279
aVthey found themselves in a shortage of labor.
p280
aa(lp281
VThese diagrams show
p282
aVa more general social background.
p283
aVThe first one is the Engels coefficient,
p284
aVwhich explains that the cost of daily necessities
p285
aVhas dropped its percentage
p286
aVall through the past decade,
p287
aVin terms of family income,
p288
aVto about 37-some percent.
p289
aVBut then in the last two years,
p290
aVit goes up again to 39 percent,
p291
aVindicating a rising living cost.
p292
aVThe Gini coefficient
p293
aVhas already passed the dangerous line of 0.4.
p294
aVNow it's 0.5 \u2014
p295
aVeven worse than that in America \u2014
p296
aVshowing us the income inequality.
p297
aVAnd so you see this whole society
p298
aVgetting frustrated
p299
aVabout losing some of its mobility.
p300
aVAnd also, the bitterness and even resentment
p301
aVtowards the rich and the powerful
p302
aVis quite widespread.
p303
aVSo any accusations of corruption
p304
aVor backdoor dealings between authorities or business
p305
aVwould arouse a social outcry
p306
aVor even unrest.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo through some of the hottest topics on microblogging,
p309
aVwe can see what young people care most about.
p310
aVSocial justice and government accountability
p311
aVruns the first in what they demand.
p312
aVFor the past decade or so,
p313
aVa massive urbanization and development
p314
aVhave let us witness a lot of reports
p315
aVon the forced demolition
p316
aVof private property.
p317
aVAnd it has aroused huge anger and frustration
p318
aVamong our young generation.
p319
aVSometimes people get killed,
p320
aVand sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest.
p321
aVSo when these incidents are reported
p322
aVmore and more frequently on the Internet,
p323
aVpeople cry for the government to take actions to stop this.
p324
aa(lp325
VSo the good news is that earlier this year,
p326
aVthe state council passed a new regulation
p327
aVon house requisition and demolition
p328
aVand passed the right
p329
aVto order forced demolition from local governments
p330
aVto the court.
p331
aVSimilarly, many other issues concerning public safety
p332
aVis a hot topic on the Internet.
p333
aVWe heard about polluted air,
p334
aVpolluted water, poisoned food.
p335
aVAnd guess what, we have faked beef.
p336
aVThey have sorts of ingredients
p337
aVthat you brush on a piece of chicken or fish,
p338
aVand it turns it to look like beef.
p339
aVAnd then lately,
p340
aVpeople are very concerned about cooking oil,
p341
aVbecause thousands of people have been found
p342
aV[refining] cooking oil
p343
aVfrom restaurant slop.
p344
aVSo all these things
p345
aVhave aroused a huge outcry from the Internet.
p346
aVAnd fortunately,
p347
aVwe have seen the government
p348
aVresponding more timely and also more frequently
p349
aVto the public concerns.
p350
aa(lp351
VWhile young people seem to be very sure
p352
aVabout their participation
p353
aVin public policy-making,
p354
aVbut sometimes they're a little bit lost
p355
aVin terms of what they want for their personal life.
p356
aVChina is soon to pass the U.S.
p357
aVas the number one market
p358
aVfor luxury brands \u2014
p359
aVthat's not including the Chinese expenditures
p360
aVin Europe and elsewhere.
p361
aVBut you know what, half of those consumers
p362
aVare earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars.
p363
aVThey're not rich at all.
p364
aVThey're taking those bags and clothes
p365
aVas a sense of identity and social status.
p366
aVAnd this is a girl explicitly saying
p367
aVon a TV dating show
p368
aVthat she would rather cry in a BMW
p369
aVthan smile on a bicycle.
p370
aVBut of course, we do have young people
p371
aVwho would still prefer to smile,
p372
aVwhether in a BMW or [on] a bicycle.
p373
aa(lp374
VSo in the next picture, you see a very popular phenomenon
p375
aVcalled "naked" wedding, or "naked" marriage.
p376
aVIt does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding,
p377
aVbut it shows that these young couples are ready to get married
p378
aVwithout a house, without a car, without a diamond ring
p379
aVand without a wedding banquet,
p380
aVto show their commitment to true love.
p381
aVAnd also, people are doing good through social media.
p382
aVAnd the first picture showed us
p383
aVthat a truck caging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogs
p384
aVfor food processing
p385
aVwas spotted and stopped on the highway
p386
aVwith the whole country watching
p387
aVthrough microblogging.
p388
aVPeople were donating money, dog food
p389
aVand offering volunteer work to stop that truck.
p390
aVAnd after hours of negotiation,
p391
aV500 dogs were rescued.
p392
aVAnd here also people are helping to find missing children.
p393
aVA father posted his son's picture onto the Internet.
p394
aVAfter thousands of resends in relay,
p395
aVthe child was found,
p396
aVand we witnessed the reunion of the family
p397
aVthrough microblogging.
p398
aa(lp399
VSo happiness is the most popular word
p400
aVwe have heard through the past two years.
p401
aVHappiness is not only related
p402
aVto personal experiences and personal values,
p403
aVbut also, it's about the environment.
p404
aVPeople are thinking about the following questions:
p405
aVAre we going to sacrifice our environment further
p406
aVto produce higher GDP?
p407
aVHow are we going to perform our social and political reform
p408
aVto keep pace with economic growth,
p409
aVto keep sustainability and stability?
p410
aVAnd also, how capable is the system
p411
aVof self-correctness
p412
aVto keep more people content
p413
aVwith all sorts of friction going on at the same time?
p414
aVI guess these are the questions people are going to answer.
p415
aVAnd our younger generation
p416
aVare going to transform this country
p417
aVwhile at the same time being transformed themselves.
p418
