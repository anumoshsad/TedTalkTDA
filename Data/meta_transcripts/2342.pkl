VCan we, as adults, grow new nerve cells?
p4
aVThere's still some confusion about that question,
p5
aVas this is a fairly new field of research.
p6
aVFor example, I was talking to one of my colleagues, Robert,
p7
aVwho is an oncologist,
p8
aVand he was telling me,
p9
aV"Sandrine, this is puzzling.
p10
aVSome of my patients that have been told they are cured of their cancer
p11
aVstill develop symptoms of depression."
p12
aVAnd I responded to him,
p13
aV"Well, from my point of view that makes sense.
p14
aVThe drug you give to your patients that stops the cancer cells multiplying
p15
aValso stops the newborn neurons being generated in their brain."
p16
aVAnd then Robert looked at me like I was crazy and said,
p17
aV"But Sandrine, these are adult patients \u2014
p18
aVadults do not grow new nerve cells."
p19
aVAnd much to his surprise, I said, "Well actually, we do."
p20
aVAnd this is a phenomenon that we call neurogenesis.
p21

p23
aa(lp24
VNow Robert is not a neuroscientist,
p25
aVand when he went to medical school he was not taught what we know now \u2014
p26
aVthat the adult brain can generate new nerve cells.
p27
aVSo Robert, you know, being the good doctor that he is,
p28
aVwanted to come to my lab
p29
aVto understand the topic a little bit better.
p30
aVAnd I took him for a tour
p31
aVof one of the most exciting parts of the brain
p32
aVwhen it comes to neurogenesis \u2014
p33
aVand this is the hippocampus.
p34
aVSo this is this gray structure in the center of the brain.
p35
aVAnd what we've known already for very long,
p36
aVis that this is important for learning, memory, mood and emotion.
p37
aVHowever, what we have learned more recently
p38
aVis that this is one of the unique structures of the adult brain
p39
aVwhere new neurons can be generated.
p40
aVAnd if we slice through the hippocampus
p41
aVand zoom in,
p42
aVwhat you actually see here in blue
p43
aVis a newborn neuron in an adult mouse brain.
p44
aVSo when it comes to the human brain \u2014
p45
aVmy colleague Jonas Frisén from the Karolinska Institutet,
p46
aVhas estimated that we produce 700 new neurons per day
p47
aVin the hippocampus.
p48
aVYou might think this is not much,
p49
aVcompared to the billions of neurons we have.
p50
aVBut by the time we turn 50,
p51
aVwe will have all exchanged the neurons we were born with in that structure
p52
aVwith adult-born neurons.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo why are these new neurons important and what are their functions?
p55
aVFirst, we know that they're important for learning and memory.
p56
aVAnd in the lab we have shown
p57
aVthat if we block the ability of the adult brain
p58
aVto produce new neurons in the hippocampus,
p59
aVthen we block certain memory abilities.
p60
aVAnd this is especially new and true for spatial recognition \u2014
p61
aVso like, how you navigate your way in the city.
p62
aa(lp63
VWe are still learning a lot,
p64
aVand neurons are not only important for memory capacity,
p65
aVbut also for the quality of the memory.
p66
aVAnd they will have been helpful to add time to our memory
p67
aVand they will help differentiate very similar memories, like:
p68
aVhow do you find your bike
p69
aVthat you park at the station every day in the same area,
p70
aVbut in a slightly different position?
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd more interesting to my colleague Robert
p73
aVis the research we have been doing on neurogenesis and depression.
p74
aVSo in an animal model of depression,
p75
aVwe have seen that we have a lower level of neurogenesis.
p76
aVAnd if we give antidepressants,
p77
aVthen we increase the production of these newborn neurons,
p78
aVand we decrease the symptoms of depression,
p79
aVestablishing a clear link between neurogenesis and depression.
p80
aVBut moreover, if you just block neurogenesis,
p81
aVthen you block the efficacy of the antidepressant.
p82
aVSo by then, Robert had understood
p83
aVthat very likely his patients were suffering from depression
p84
aVeven after being cured of their cancer,
p85
aVbecause the cancer drug had stopped newborn neurons from being generated.
p86
aVAnd it will take time to generate new neurons
p87
aVthat reach normal functions.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo, collectively, now we think we have enough evidence
p90
aVto say that neurogenesis is a target of choice
p91
aVif we want to improve memory formation or mood,
p92
aVor even prevent the decline associated with aging,
p93
aVor associated with stress.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo the next question is:
p96
aVcan we control neurogenesis?
p97
aVThe answer is yes.
p98
aVAnd we are now going to do a little quiz.
p99
aVI'm going to give you a set of behaviors and activities,
p100
aVand you tell me if you think they will increase neurogenesis
p101
aVor if they will decrease neurogenesis.
p102
aVAre we ready?
p103
aVOK, let's go.
p104
aa(lp105
VSo what about learning?
p106
aVIncreasing?
p107
aVYes.
p108
aVLearning will increase the production of these new neurons.
p109
aa(lp110
VHow about stress?
p111
aVYes, stress will decrease the production of new neurons in the hippocampus.
p112
aa(lp113
VHow about sleep deprivation?
p114
aVIndeed, it will decrease neurogenesis.
p115
aa(lp116
VHow about sex?
p117
aVOh, wow!
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VYes, you are right, it will increase the production of new neurons.
p122
aVHowever, it's all about balance here.
p123
aVWe don't want to fall in a situation \u2014
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
Vabout too much sex leading to sleep deprivation.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VHow about getting older?
p132
aVSo the neurogenesis rate will decrease as we get older,
p133
aVbut it is still occurring.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd then finally, how about running?
p136
aVI will let you judge that one by yourself.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo this is one of the first studies
p139
aVthat was carried out by one of my mentors, Rusty Gage from the Salk Institute,
p140
aVshowing that the environment can have an impact
p141
aVon the production of new neurons.
p142
aVAnd here you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse
p143
aVthat had no running wheel in its cage.
p144
aVAnd the little black dots you see are actually newborn neurons-to-be.
p145
aVAnd now, you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse
p146
aVthat had a running wheel in its cage.
p147
aVSo you see the massive increase
p148
aVof the black dots representing the new neurons-to-be.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo activity impacts neurogenesis, but that's not all.
p151
aVWhat you eat will have an effect
p152
aVon the production of new neurons in the hippocampus.
p153
aVSo here we have a sample of diet \u2014
p154
aVof nutrients that have been shown to have efficacy.
p155
aVAnd I'm just going to point a few out to you:
p156
aVCalorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent will increase neurogenesis.
p157
aVIntermittent fasting \u2014 spacing the time between your meals \u2014
p158
aVwill increase neurogenesis.
p159
aVIntake of flavonoids,
p160
aVwhich are contained in dark chocolate or blueberries,
p161
aVwill increase neurogenesis.
p162
aVOmega-3 fatty acids,
p163
aVpresent in fatty fish, like salmon,
p164
aVwill increase the production of these new neurons.
p165
aVConversely, a diet rich in high saturated fat
p166
aVwill have a negative impact on neurogenesis.
p167
aVEthanol \u2014 intake of alcohol \u2014 will decrease neurogenesis.
p168
aVHowever, not everything is lost;
p169
aVresveratrol, which is contained in red wine,
p170
aVhas been shown to promote the survival of these new neurons.
p171
aVSo next time you are at a dinner party,
p172
aVyou might want to reach for this possibly "neurogenesis-neutral" drink.
p173
aa(lp174
V(Laughter)
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd then finally, let me point out the last one \u2014
p177
aVa quirky one.
p178
aVSo Japanese groups are fascinated with food textures,
p179
aVand they have shown that actually soft diet impairs neurogenesis,
p180
aVas opposed to food that requires mastication \u2014 chewing \u2014 or crunchy food.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo all of this data,
p183
aVwhere we need to look at the cellular level,
p184
aVhas been generated using animal models.
p185
aVBut this diet has also been given to human participants,
p186
aVand what we could see is that the diet modulates memory and mood
p187
aVin the same direction as it modulates neurogenesis,
p188
aVsuch as: calorie restriction will improve memory capacity,
p189
aVwhereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate symptoms of depression \u2014
p190
aVas opposed to omega-3 fatty acids, which increase neurogenesis,
p191
aVand also help to decrease the symptoms of depression.
p192
aVSo we think that the effect of diet
p193
aVon mental health, on memory and mood,
p194
aVis actually mediated by the production of the new neurons in the hippocampus.
p195
aVAnd it's not only what you eat,
p196
aVbut it's also the texture of the food, when you eat it
p197
aVand how much of it you eat.
p198
aa(lp199
VOn our side \u2014 neuroscientists interested in neurogenesis \u2014
p200
aVwe need to understand better the function of these new neurons,
p201
aVand how we can control their survival and their production.
p202
aVWe also need to find a way to protect the neurogenesis of Robert's patients.
p203
aVAnd on your side \u2014
p204
aVI leave you in charge of your neurogenesis.
p205
aa(lp206
VThank you.

p209
aa(lp210
VMargaret Heffernan: Fantastic research, Sandrine.
p211
aVNow, I told you you changed my life \u2014
p212
aVI now eat a lot of blueberries.
p213
aa(lp214
VSandrine Thuret: Very good.
p215
aa(lp216
VMH: I'm really interested in the running thing.
p217
aVDo I have to run?
p218
aVOr is it really just about aerobic exercise,
p219
aVgetting oxygen to the brain?
p220
aVCould it be any kind of vigorous exercise?
p221
aa(lp222
VST: So for the moment,
p223
aVwe can't really say if it's just the running itself,
p224
aVbut we think that anything that indeed will increase the production \u2014
p225
aVor moving the blood flow to the brain,
p226
aVshould be beneficial.
p227
aa(lp228
VMH: So I don't have to get a running wheel in my office?
p229
aa(lp230
VST: No, you don't!
p231
aa(lp232
VMH: Oh, what a relief! That's wonderful.
