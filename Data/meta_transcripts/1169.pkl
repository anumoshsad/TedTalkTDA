VI'm a contemporary artist
p4
aVwith a bit of an unexpected background.
p5
aVI was in my 20s before I ever went to an art museum.
p6
aVI grew up in the middle of nowhere
p7
aVon a dirt road in rural Arkansas,
p8
aVan hour from the nearest movie theater.
p9
aVAnd I think it was a great place to grow up as an artist
p10
aVbecause I grew up around quirky, colorful characters
p11
aVwho were great at making with their hands.
p12
aVAnd my childhood is more hick
p13
aVthan I could ever possibly relate to you,
p14
aVand also more intellectual than you would ever expect.
p15
aVFor instance, me and my sister, when we were little,
p16
aVwe would compete to see who could eat the most squirrel brains.
p17
aV(Laughter)
p18
aVBut on the other side of that, though,
p19
aVwe were big readers in our house.
p20
aVAnd if the TV was on, we were watching a documentary.
p21
aVAnd my dad is the most voracious reader I know.
p22
aVHe can read a novel or two a day.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut when I was little, I remember,
p25
aVhe would kill flies in our house with my BB gun.
p26
aVAnd what was so amazing to me about that \u2014
p27
aVwell he would be in his recliner, would holler for me to fetch the BB gun,
p28
aVand I'd go get it.
p29
aVAnd what was amazing to me \u2014
p30
aVwell it was pretty kickass; he was killing a fly in the house with a gun \u2014
p31
aVbut what was so amazing to me
p32
aVwas that he knew just enough how to pump it.
p33
aVAnd he could shoot it from two rooms away
p34
aVand not damage what it was on
p35
aVbecause he knew how to pump it just enough to kill the fly
p36
aVand not damage what it landed on.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo I should talk about art.
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVOr we'll be here all day with my childhood stories.
p41
aVI love contemporary art,
p42
aVbut I'm often really frustrated with the contemporary art world
p43
aVand the contemporary art scene.
p44
aVA few years ago,
p45
aVI spent months in Europe
p46
aVto see the major international art exhibitions
p47
aVthat have the pulse
p48
aVof what is supposed to be going on in the art world.
p49
aVAnd I was struck
p50
aVby going to so many, one after the other,
p51
aVwith some clarity of what it was
p52
aVthat I was longing for.
p53
aVAnd I was longing for several things that I wasn't getting,
p54
aVor not getting enough of.
p55
aVBut two of the main things:
p56
aVone of it, I was longing for more work
p57
aVthat was appealing to a broad public,
p58
aVthat was accessible.
p59
aVAnd the second thing that I was longing for
p60
aVwas some more exquisite craftsmanship
p61
aVand technique.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo I started thinking and listing
p64
aVwhat all it was that I thought would make a perfect biennial.
p65
aVSo I decided,
p66
aVI'm going to start my own biennial.
p67
aVI'm going to organize it and direct it
p68
aVand get it going in the world.
p69
aVSo I thought, okay,
p70
aVI have to have some criteria of how to choose work.
p71
aVSo amongst all the criteria I have,
p72
aVthere's two main things.
p73
aVOne of them, I call my Mimaw's Test.
p74
aVAnd what that is
p75
aVis I imagine explaining a work of art
p76
aVto my grandmother in five minutes,
p77
aVand if I can't explain it in five minutes,
p78
aVthen it's too obtuse
p79
aVor esoteric
p80
aVand it hasn't been refined enough yet.
p81
aVIt needs to worked on
p82
aVuntil it can speak fluently.
p83
aVAnd then my other second set of rules \u2014
p84
aVI hate to say "rules" because it's art \u2014
p85
aVmy criteria would be
p86
aVthe three H's,
p87
aVwhich is head, heart and hands.
p88
aVAnd great art would have "head":
p89
aVit would have interesting intellectual ideas
p90
aVand concepts.
p91
aVIt would have "heart" in that it would have passion
p92
aVand heart and soul.
p93
aVAnd it would have "hand" in that it would be greatly crafted.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo I started thinking about
p96
aVhow am I going to do this biennial,
p97
aVhow am I going to travel the world
p98
aVand find these artists?
p99
aVAnd then I realized one day, there's an easier solution to this.
p100
aVI'm just going to make the whole thing myself.
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aVAnd so this is what I did.
p103
aVSo I thought, a biennial needs artists.
p104
aVI'm going to do an international biennial; I need artists from all around the world.
p105
aVSo what I did was
p106
aVI invented a hundred artists from around the world.
p107
aVI figured out their bios, their passions in life
p108
aVand their art styles,
p109
aVand I started making their work.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
V(Applause)
p114
aa(lp115
VI felt, oh this is the kind of project that I could spend my whole life doing.
p116
aVSo I decided, I'm going to make this a real biennial.
p117
aVIt's going to be two years of studio work.
p118
aVAnd I'm going to create this in two years,
p119
aVand I have.
p120
aVSo I should start to talk about these guys.
p121
aVWell the range is quite a bit.
p122
aVAnd I'm such a technician, so I loved this project,
p123
aVgetting to play with all the techniques.
p124
aVSo for example, in realist paintings,
p125
aVit ranges from this,
p126
aVwhich is kind of old masters style,
p127
aVto really realistic still-life,
p128
aVto this type of painting where I'm painting with a single hair.
p129
aVAnd then at the other end, there's performance and short films
p130
aVand indoor installations
p131
aVlike this indoor installation
p132
aVand this one,
p133
aVand outdoor installations like this one
p134
aVand this one.
p135
aVI know I should mention: I'm making all these things.
p136
aVThis isn't Photoshopped.
p137
aVI'm under the river with those fish.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo now let me introduce some of my fictional artists to you.
p140
aVThis is Nell Remmel.
p141
aVNell is interested in agricultural processes,
p142
aVand her work is based in these practices.
p143
aVThis piece, which is called "Flipped Earth" \u2014
p144
aVshe was interested in taking the sky
p145
aVand using it to cleanse barren ground.
p146
aVAnd by taking giant mirrors \u2014
p147
aV(Applause)
p148
aVand here she's taking giant mirrors
p149
aVand pulling them into the dirt.
p150
aVAnd this is 22 feet long.
p151
aVAnd what I loved about her work
p152
aVis, when I would walk around it
p153
aVand look down into the sky,
p154
aVlooking down to watch the sky,
p155
aVand it unfolded in a new way.
p156
aVAnd probably the best part of this piece
p157
aVis at dusk and dawn
p158
aVwhen the twilight wedge has fallen and the ground's dark,
p159
aVbut there's still the light above, bright above.
p160
aVAnd so you're standing there and everything else is dark,
p161
aVbut there's this portal that you want to jump in.
p162
aVThis piece was great. This is in my parents' backyard in Arkansas.
p163
aVAnd I love to dig a hole.
p164
aVSo this piece was great fun
p165
aVbecause it was two days of digging in soft dirt.
p166
aa(lp167
VThe next artist is Kay Overstry,
p168
aVand she's interested in ephemerality and transience.
p169
aVAnd in her most recent project,
p170
aVit's called "Weather I Made."
p171
aVAnd she's making weather
p172
aVon her body's scale.
p173
aVAnd this piece is "Frost."
p174
aVAnd what she did was she went out on a cold, dry night
p175
aVand breathed back and forth on the lawn
p176
aVto leave \u2014
p177
aVto leave her life's mark,
p178
aVthe mark of her life.
p179
aV(Applause)
p180
aVAnd so this is five-foot, five-inches of frost
p181
aVthat she left behind.
p182
aVThe sun rises, and it melts away.
p183
aVAnd that was played by my mom.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo the next artist, this is a group of Japanese artists,
p186
aVa collective of Japanese artists \u2014
p187
aV(Laughter)
p188
aVin Tokyo.
p189
aVAnd they were interested in developing a new, alternative art space,
p190
aVand they needed funding for it,
p191
aVso they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects.
p192
aVOne of these is scratch-off masterpieces.
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aVAnd so what they're doing \u2014
p195
aVeach of these artists on a nine-by-seven-inch card,
p196
aVwhich they sell for 10 bucks,
p197
aVthey drew original works of art.
p198
aVAnd you buy one, and maybe you get a real piece, and maybe not.
p199
aVWell this has sparked a craze in Japan,
p200
aVbecause everyone's wanting a masterpiece.
p201
aVAnd the ones that are the most sought after
p202
aVare the ones that are only barely scratched off.
p203
aVAnd all these works, in some way,
p204
aVtalk about luck or fate or chance.
p205
aVThose first two
p206
aVare portraits of mega-jackpot winners years before and after their win.
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd in this one it's called "Drawing the Short Stick."
p209
aV(Laughter)
p210
aVI love this piece because I have a little cousin at home
p211
aVwho introduced me \u2014 which I think is such a great introduction \u2014
p212
aVto a friend one day as, "This is my cousin Shea.
p213
aVHe draws sticks real good."
p214
aV(Laughter)
p215
aVWhich is one of the best compliments ever.
p216
aa(lp217
VThis artist is Gus Weinmueller,
p218
aVand he's doing a project, a large project, called "Art for the Peoples."
p219
aVAnd within this project, he's doing a smaller project
p220
aVcalled "Artists in Residence."
p221
aVAnd what he does is \u2014
p222
aV(Laughter)
p223
aVhe spends a week at a time with a family.
p224
aVAnd he shows up on their porch, their doorstep,
p225
aVwith a toothbrush and pajamas,
p226
aVand he's ready to spend the week with them.
p227
aVAnd using only what's present,
p228
aVhe goes in and makes a little abode studio to work out of.
p229
aVAnd he spends that week talking to the family
p230
aVabout what do they think great art is.
p231
aVHe has all these discussions with their family,
p232
aVand he digs through everything they have,
p233
aVand he finds materials to make work.
p234
aVAnd he makes a work
p235
aVthat answers what they think great art is.
p236
aVFor this family, he made this still-life painting.
p237
aVAnd whatever he makes
p238
aVsomehow references nesting and space
p239
aVand personal property.
p240
aa(lp241
VThis next project,
p242
aVthis is by Jaochim Parisvega,
p243
aVand he's interested in \u2014
p244
aVhe believes art is everywhere waiting \u2014
p245
aVthat it just needs a little bit of a push to happen.
p246
aVAnd he provides this push by harnessing natural forces,
p247
aVlike in his series where he used rain to make paintings.
p248
aVThis project is called "Love Nests."
p249
aVWhat he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him.
p250
aVSo he put the material in places where the birds were going to collect them,
p251
aVand they crafted his nests for him.
p252
aVAnd this one's called "Lovelock's Nest."
p253
aVThis one's called "Mixtape Love Song's Nest."
p254
aV(Laughter)
p255
aVAnd this one's called "Lovemaking Nest."
p256
aV(Laughted)
p257
aa(lp258
VNext is Sylvia Slater.
p259
aVSylvia's interested in art training.
p260
aVShe's a very serious Swiss artist.
p261
aV(Laughter)
p262
aVAnd she was thinking about her friends and family
p263
aVwho work in chaos-ridden places and developing countries,
p264
aVand she was thinking,
p265
aVwhat can I make that would be of value to them,
p266
aVin case something bad happens
p267
aVand they have to buy their way across the border
p268
aVor pay off a gunman?
p269
aVAnd so she came up with creating
p270
aVthese pocket-sized artworks
p271
aVthat are portraits of the person that would carry them.
p272
aVAnd you would carry this around with you,
p273
aVand if everything went to hell, you could make payments
p274
aVand buy your life.
p275
aVSo this life price
p276
aVis for an irrigation non-profit director.
p277
aVSo hopefully what happens is you never use it,
p278
aVand it's an heirloom that you pass down.
p279
aVAnd she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments,
p280
aVor they could be like these, which are leaves that can be payments.
p281
aVAnd so they're valuable. This is precious metals and gemstones.
p282
aVAnd this one had to get broken up.
p283
aVHe had to break off a piece to get out of Egypt recently.
p284
aa(lp285
VThis is by a duo, Michael Abernathy and Bud Holland.
p286
aVAnd they're interested in creating culture,
p287
aVjust tradition.
p288
aVSo what they do is they move into an area
p289
aVand try to establish a new tradition in a small geographic area.
p290
aVSo this is in Eastern Tennessee,
p291
aVand what they decided was
p292
aVthat we need a positive tradition
p293
aVthat goes with death.
p294
aVSo they came up with "dig jigs."
p295
aVAnd a dig jig \u2014
p296
aVa dig jig is where,
p297
aVfor a milestone anniversary or a birthday,
p298
aVyou gather all your friends and family together
p299
aVand you dance on where you're going to be buried.
p300
aV(Laughter)
p301
aVAnd we got a lot of attention when we did it.
p302
aVI talked my family into doing this, and they didn't know what I was doing.
p303
aVAnd I was like, "Get dressed for a funeral. We're going to go do some work."
p304
aVAnd so we got to the grave and made this, which was hilarious \u2014
p305
aVthe attention that we got.
p306
aVSo what happens is you dance on the grave,
p307
aVand after you've done your dance,
p308
aVeveryone toasts you and tells you how great you are.
p309
aVAnd you in essence have a funeral
p310
aVthat you get to be present for.
p311
aVThat's my mom and dad.
p312
aa(lp313
VThis is by Jason Birdsong.
p314
aVHe is interested in how we see as an animal,
p315
aVhow we are interested in mimicry and camouflage.
p316
aVYou know, we look down a dark alley
p317
aVor a jungle path,
p318
aVtrying to make out a face or a creature.
p319
aVWe just have that natural way of seeing.
p320
aVAnd he plays with this idea.
p321
aVAnd this piece: those aren't actually leaves.
p322
aVThey're butterfly specimens who have a natural camouflage.
p323
aVSo he pairs these up.
p324
aVThere's another pile of leaves.
p325
aVThose are actually all real butterfly specimens.
p326
aVAnd he pairs these up with paintings.
p327
aVLike this is a painting of a snake in a box.
p328
aVSo you open the box and you think, "Whoa, there's a snake in there."
p329
aVBut it's actually a painting.
p330
aVSo he makes these interesting conversations
p331
aVabout realism and mimicry
p332
aVand our drive to be fooled by great camouflage.
p333
aa(lp334
V(Laughter)
p335
aa(lp336
VThe next artist is Hazel Clausen.
p337
aVHazel Clausen is an anthropologist who took a sabbatical
p338
aVand decided, "You know, I would learn a lot about culture
p339
aVif I created a culture that doesn't exist from scratch."
p340
aVSo that's what she did.
p341
aVShe created the Swiss people named the Uvulites,
p342
aVand they have this distinctive yodeling song
p343
aVthat they use the uvula for.
p344
aVAnd also they reference how the uvula \u2014
p345
aVeverything they say is fallen
p346
aVbecause of the forbidden fruit.
p347
aVAnd that's the symbol of their culture.
p348
aVAnd this is from a documentary
p349
aVcalled "Sexual Practices and Populations Control
p350
aVAmong the Uvulites."
p351
aVThis is a typical angora embroidery for them.
p352
aVThis is one of their founders, Gert Schaeffer.
p353
aV(Laughter)
p354
aVAnd actually this is my Aunt Irene.
p355
aVIt was so funny having a fake person
p356
aVwho was making fake things.
p357
aVAnd I crack up at this piece,
p358
aVbecause when I see it I know that's French angora
p359
aVand all antique German ribbons
p360
aVand wool that I got in a Nebraska mill
p361
aVand carried around for 10 years
p362
aVand then antique Chinese skirts.
p363
aa(lp364
VThe next is a collective of artists
p365
aVcalled the Silver Dobermans,
p366
aVand their motto is to spread pragmatism
p367
aVone person at a time.
p368
aV(Laughter)
p369
aVAnd they're really interested
p370
aVin how over-coddled we've become.
p371
aVSo this is one of their comments on how over-coddled we've become.
p372
aVAnd what they've done
p373
aVis they put a warning sign on every single barb on this fence.
p374
aV(Laughter)
p375
aV(Applause)
p376
aVAnd this is called "Horse Sense Fence."
p377
aa(lp378
VThe next artist is K. M. Yoon,
p379
aVa really interesting South Korean artist.
p380
aVAnd he's reworking a Confucian art tradition
p381
aVof scholar stones.
p382
aVNext is Maynard Sipes.
p383
aVAnd I love Maynard Sipes,
p384
aVbut he's off in his own world,
p385
aVand, bless his heart, he's so paranoid.
p386
aVNext is Roy Penig,
p387
aVa really interesting Kentucky artist,
p388
aVand he's the nicest guy.
p389
aVHe even once traded a work of art for a block of government cheese
p390
aVbecause the person wanted it so badly.
p391
aa(lp392
VNext is an Australian artist, Janeen Jackson,
p393
aVand this is from a project of hers
p394
aVcalled "What an Artwork Does When We're Not Watching."
p395
aV(Laughter)
p396
aVNext is by a Lithuanian fortune teller, Jurgi Petrauskas.
p397
aVNext is Ginger Cheshire.
p398
aVThis is from a short film of hers called "The Last Person."
p399
aVAnd that's my cousin and my sister's dog, Gabby.
p400
aVThe next, this is by Sam Sandy.
p401
aVHe's an Australian Aboriginal elder,
p402
aVand he's also an artist.
p403
aVAnd this is from a large traveling sculpture project
p404
aVthat he's doing.
p405
aa(lp406
VThis is from Estelle Willoughsby.
p407
aVShe heals with color.
p408
aVAnd she's one of the most prolific of all these hundred artists,
p409
aVeven though she's going to be 90 next year.
p410
aV(Laughter)
p411
aVThis is by Z. Zhou,
p412
aVand he's interested in stasis.
p413
aVNext is by Hilda Singh,
p414
aVand she's doing a whole project called "Social Outfits."
p415
aa(lp416
VNext is by Vera Sokolova.
p417
aVAnd I have to say, Vera kind of scares me.
p418
aVYou can't look her directly in the eyes
p419
aVbecause she's kind of scary.
p420
aVAnd it's good that she's not real;
p421
aVshe'd be mad that I said that.
p422
aV(Laughter)
p423
aVAnd she's an optometrist in St. Petersburg,
p424
aVand she plays with optics.
p425
aVNext, this is by Thomas Swifton.
p426
aVThis is from a short film, "Adventures with Skinny."
p427
aV(Laughter)
p428
aVAnd this is by Cicily Bennett,
p429
aVand it's from a series of short films.
p430
aa(lp431
VAnd after this one, there's 77 other artists.
p432
aVAnd all together with those other 77 you're not seeing,
p433
aVthat's my biennial.
p434
aVThank you. Thank you.
p435
aVThanks.
p436
aV(Applause)
p437
aVThank you. Thanks.
