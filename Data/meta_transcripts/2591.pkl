VI'd like you to imagine the world anew.
p4
aVI'd like to show you some maps,
p5
aVwhich have been drawn by Ben Hennig,
p6
aVof the planet in a way
p7
aVthat most of you will never have seen the planet depicted before.
p8
aa(lp9
VHere's an image that you're very familiar with.
p10
aVI'm old enough that I was actually born before we saw this image.
p11
aVApparently some of my first words were "moona, moona,"
p12
aVbut I think that's my mom having a particular fantasy
p13
aVabout what her baby boy could see
p14
aVon the flickering black and white TV screen.
p15
aVIt's only been a few centuries
p16
aVsince we've actually, most of us, thought of our planet as spherical.
p17
aVWhen we first saw these images in the 1960s,
p18
aVthe world was changing at an incredible rate.
p19
aVIn my own little discipline of human geography,
p20
aVa cartographer called Waldo Tobler
p21
aVwas drawing new maps of the planet,
p22
aVand these maps have now spread,
p23
aVand I'm going to show you one of them now.
p24
aVThis map is a map of the world,
p25
aVbut it's a map which looks to you
p26
aVa little bit strange.
p27
aVIt's a map in which we stretched places,
p28
aVso that those areas which contain many people are drawn larger,
p29
aVand those areas, like the Sahara and the Himalayas,
p30
aVin which there are few people, have been shrunk away.
p31
aVEverybody on the planet is given an equal amount of space.
p32
aVThe cities are shown shining bright.
p33
aVThe lines are showing you submarine cables and trade routes.
p34
aVAnd there's one particular line that goes from the Chinese port of Dalian
p35
aVthrough past Singapore,
p36
aVthrough the Suez Canal,
p37
aVthrough the Mediterranean and round to Rotterdam.
p38
aVAnd it's showing you the route
p39
aVof what was the world's largest ship just a year ago,
p40
aVa ship which was taking so many containers of goods
p41
aVthat when they were unloaded,
p42
aVif the lorries had all gone in convoy, they would have been 100 kilometers long.
p43
aVThis is how our world is now connected.
p44
aVThis is the quantity of stuff we are now moving around the world,
p45
aVjust on one ship, on one voyage,
p46
aVin five weeks.
p47
aa(lp48
VWe've lived in cities for a very long time,
p49
aVbut most of us didn't live in cities.
p50
aVThis is Çatalhöyük, one of the world's first cities.
p51
aVAt its peak 9,000 years ago,
p52
aVpeople had to walk over the roofs of others' houses to get to their home.
p53
aVIf you look carefully at the map of the city,
p54
aVyou'll see it has no streets,
p55
aVbecause streets are something we invented.
p56
aVThe world changes.
p57
aVIt changes by trial and error.
p58
aVWe work out slowly and gradually
p59
aVhow to live in better ways.
p60
aVAnd the world has changed incredibly quickly most recently.
p61
aVIt's only within the last six, seven, or eight generations
p62
aVthat we have actually realized that we are a species.
p63
aVIt's only within the last few decades
p64
aVthat a map like this could be drawn.
p65
aVAgain, the underlying map is the map of world population,
p66
aVbut over it, you're seeing arrows showing how we spread out of Africa
p67
aVwith dates showing you where we think we arrived
p68
aVat particular times.
p69
aVI have to redraw this map every few months,
p70
aVbecause somebody makes a discovery that a particular date was wrong.
p71
aVWe are learning about ourselves at an incredible speed.
p72
aVAnd we're changing.
p73
aVA lot of change is gradual.
p74
aVIt's accretion.
p75
aVWe don't notice the change
p76
aVbecause we only have short lives,
p77
aV70, 80, if you're lucky 90 years.
p78
aVThis graph is showing you
p79
aVthe annual rate of population growth in the world.
p80
aVIt was very low until around about 1850,
p81
aVand then the rate of population growth
p82
aVbegan to rise
p83
aVso that around the time I was born,
p84
aVwhen we first saw those images from the moon of our planet,
p85
aVour global population was growing at two percent a year.
p86
aVIf it had carried on growing at two percent a year
p87
aVfor just another couple of centuries,
p88
aVthe entire planet would be covered
p89
aVwith a seething mass of human bodies
p90
aVall touching each other.
p91
aVAnd people were scared.
p92
aVThey were scared of population growth
p93
aVand what they called "the population bomb" in 1968.
p94
aVBut then, if you look at the end of the graph,
p95
aVthe growth began to slow.
p96
aVThe decade \u2014
p97
aVthe '70s, the '80s, the '90s, the noughties,
p98
aVand in this decade, even faster \u2014
p99
aVour population growth is slowing.
p100
aVOur planet is stabilizing.
p101
aVWe are heading towards nine, 10, or 11 billion people
p102
aVby the end of the century.
p103
aVWithin that change, you can see tumult.
p104
aVYou can see the Second World War.
p105
aVYou can see the pandemic in 1918 from influenza.
p106
aVYou can see the great Chinese famine.
p107
aVThese are the events we tend to concentrate on.
p108
aVWe tend to concentrate on the terrible events in the news.
p109
aVWe don't tend to concentrate on the gradual change
p110
aVand the good news stories.
p111
aa(lp112
VWe worry about people.
p113
aVWe worry about how many people there are.
p114
aVWe worry about how you can get away from people.
p115
aVBut this is the map of the world changed again to make area large,
p116
aVthe further away people are from each area.
p117
aVSo if you want to know where to go to get away from everybody,
p118
aVhere's the best places to go.
p119
aVAnd every year, these areas get bigger,
p120
aVbecause every year, we are coming off the land globally.
p121
aVWe are moving into the cities.
p122
aVWe are packing in more densely.
p123
aVThere are wolves again in Europe,
p124
aVand the wolves are moving west across the continent.
p125
aVOur world is changing.
p126
aa(lp127
VYou have worries.
p128
aVThis is a map showing where the water falls on our planet.
p129
aVWe now know that.
p130
aVAnd you can look at where Çatalhöyük was,
p131
aVwhere three continents meet, Africa, Asia, and Europe,
p132
aVand you can see there are a large number of people living there
p133
aVin areas with very little water.
p134
aVAnd you can see areas in which there is a great deal of rainfall as well.
p135
aVAnd we can get a bit more sophisticated.
p136
aVInstead of making the map be shaped by people,
p137
aVwe can shape the map by water,
p138
aVand then we can change it every month
p139
aVto show the amount of water
p140
aVfalling on every small part of the globe.
p141
aVAnd you see the monsoons moving around the planet,
p142
aVand the planet almost appears to have a heartbeat.
p143
aVAnd all of this only became possible
p144
aVwithin my lifetime
p145
aVto see this is where we are living.
p146
aVWe have enough water.
p147
aa(lp148
VThis is a map of where we grow our food in the world.
p149
aVThis is the areas that we will rely on most for rice and maize and corn.
p150
aVPeople worry that there won't be enough food, but we know,
p151
aVif we just ate less meat and fed less of the crops to animals,
p152
aVthere is enough food for everybody
p153
aVas long as we think of ourselves as one group of people.
p154
aa(lp155
VAnd we also know
p156
aVabout what we do
p157
aVso terribly badly nowadays.
p158
aVYou will have seen this map of the world before.
p159
aVThis is the map
p160
aVproduced by taking satellite images,
p161
aVif you remember those satellites around the planet
p162
aVin the very first slide I showed,
p163
aVand producing an image of what the Earth looks like at night.
p164
aVWhen you normally see that map,
p165
aVon a normal map, the kind of map that most of you will be used to,
p166
aVyou think you are seeing a map of where people live.
p167
aVWhere the lights are shining up is where people live.
p168
aVBut here, on this image of the world,
p169
aVremember we've stretched the map again.
p170
aVEverywhere has the same density of people on this map.
p171
aVIf an area doesn't have people,
p172
aVwe've shrunk it away
p173
aVto make it disappear.
p174
aVSo we're showing everybody
p175
aVwith equal prominence.
p176
aVNow, the lights no longer show you where people are,
p177
aVbecause people are everywhere.
p178
aVNow the lights on the map,
p179
aVthe lights in London, the lights in Cairo, the lights in Tokyo,
p180
aVthe lights on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States,
p181
aVthe lights show you where people live
p182
aVwho are so profligate with energy
p183
aVthat they can afford
p184
aVto spend money
p185
aVpowering lights to shine up into the sky,
p186
aVso satellites can draw an image like this.
p187
aVAnd the areas that are dark on the map
p188
aVare either areas where people do not have access to that much energy,
p189
aVor areas where people do,
p190
aVbut they have learned to stop shining the light up into the sky.
p191
aVAnd if I could show you this map animated over time,
p192
aVyou would see that Tokyo has actually become darker,
p193
aVbecause ever since the tsunami in Japan,
p194
aVJapan has had to rely on a quarter less electricity
p195
aVbecause it turned the nuclear power stations off.
p196
aVAnd the world didn't end.
p197
aVYou just shone less light
p198
aVup into the sky.
p199
aa(lp200
VThere are a huge number
p201
aVof good news stories in the world.
p202
aVInfant mortality is falling
p203
aVand has been falling at an incredible rate.
p204
aVA few years ago,
p205
aVthe number of babies dying in their first year of life in the world
p206
aVfell by five percent in just one year.
p207
aVMore children are going to school
p208
aVand learning to read and write
p209
aVand getting connected to the Internet
p210
aVand going on to go to university
p211
aVthan ever before at an incredible rate,
p212
aVand the highest number of young people going to university in the world
p213
aVare women, not men.
p214
aVI can give you good news story after good news story
p215
aVabout what is getting better in the planet,
p216
aVbut we tend to concentrate
p217
aVon the bad news that is immediate.
p218
aVRebecca Solnit, I think, put it brilliantly,
p219
aVwhen she explained: "The accretion of incremental, imperceptible changes
p220
aVwhich can constitute progress and which render our era
p221
aVdramatically different from the past" \u2014
p222
aVthe past was much more stable \u2014
p223
aV"a contrast obscured by the undramatic nature of gradual transformation,
p224
aVpunctuated by occasional tumult."
p225
aVOccasionally, terrible things happen.
p226
aVYou are shown those terrible things
p227
aVon the news every night of the week.
p228
aVYou are not told about the population slowing down.
p229
aVYou are not told about the world becoming more connected.
p230
aVYou are not told about the incredible improvements in understanding.
p231
aVYou are not told about how we are learning to begin
p232
aVto waste less and consume less.
p233
aa(lp234
VThis is my last map.
p235
aVOn this map, we have taken the seas
p236
aVand the oceans out.
p237
aVNow you are just looking
p238
aVat about 7.4 billion people
p239
aVwith the map drawn in proportion to those people.
p240
aVYou're looking at over a billion in China,
p241
aVand you can see the largest city in the world in China,
p242
aVbut you do not know its name.
p243
aVYou can see that India
p244
aVis in the center of this world.
p245
aVYou can see that Europe is on the edge.
p246
aVAnd we in Exeter today
p247
aVare on the far edge of the planet.
p248
aVWe are on a tiny scrap of rock
p249
aVoff Europe
p250
aVwhich contains less than one percent
p251
aVof the world's adults,
p252
aVand less than half a percent
p253
aVof the world's children.
p254
aVWe are living in a stabilizing world, an urbanizing world,
p255
aVan aging world,
p256
aVa connecting world.
p257
aVThere are many, many things to be frightened about,
p258
aVbut there is no need for us to fear each other as much as we do,
p259
aVand we need to see that we are now living in a new world.
