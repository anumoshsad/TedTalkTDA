VI have spent the past few years
p4
aVputting myself into situations
p5
aVthat are usually very difficult
p6
aVand at the same time somewhat dangerous.
p7
aVI went to prison \u2014
p8
aVdifficult.
p9
aVI worked in a coal mine \u2014
p10
aVdangerous.
p11
aVI filmed in war zones \u2014
p12
aVdifficult and dangerous.
p13
aVAnd I spent 30 days eating nothing but this \u2014
p14
aVfun in the beginning,
p15
aVlittle difficult in the middle, very dangerous in the end.
p16
aVIn fact, most of my career,
p17
aVI've been immersing myself
p18
aVinto seemingly horrible situations
p19
aVfor the whole goal of trying
p20
aVto examine societal issues
p21
aVin a way that make them engaging, that make them interesting,
p22
aVthat hopefully break them down in a way
p23
aVthat make them entertaining and accessible to an audience.
p24
aVSo when I knew I was coming here
p25
aVto do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship,
p26
aVI knew I would want to do something a little different.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo as some of you may or may not have heard,
p29
aVa couple weeks ago, I took out an ad on eBay.
p30
aVI sent out some Facebook messages,
p31
aVsome Twitter messages,
p32
aVand I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights
p33
aVto my 2011 TED Talk.
p34
aV(Laughter)
p35
aVThat's right, some lucky individual, corporation,
p36
aVfor-profit or non-profit,
p37
aVwas going to get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity \u2014
p38
aVbecause I'm sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again \u2014
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVto buy the naming rights
p41
aVto the talk you're watching right now,
p42
aVthat at the time didn't have a title, didn't really have a lot of content
p43
aVand didn't really give much hint
p44
aVas to what the subject matter would actually be.
p45
aVSo what you were getting was this:
p46
aVYour name here presents:
p47
aVMy TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is
p48
aVand, depending on the content, could ultimately blow up in your face,
p49
aVespecially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it.
p50
aVBut that being said,
p51
aVit's a very good media opportunity.
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aVYou know how many people watch these TED Talks?
p54
aVIt's a lot.
p55
aVThat's just a working title, by the way.
p56
aV(Laughter)
p57
aVSo even with that caveat,
p58
aVI knew that someone would buy the naming rights.
p59
aa(lp60
VNow if you'd have asked me that a year ago,
p61
aVI wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty.
p62
aVBut in the new project that I'm working on, my new film,
p63
aVwe examine the world of marketing, advertising.
p64
aVAnd as I said earlier,
p65
aVI put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years,
p66
aVbut nothing could prepare me, nothing could ready me,
p67
aVfor anything as difficult
p68
aVor as dangerous
p69
aVas going into the rooms with these guys.
p70
aV(Laughter)
p71
aVYou see, I had this idea for a movie.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Video) Morgan Spurlock: What I want to do is make a film
p74
aVall about product placement, marketing and advertising,
p75
aVwhere the entire film is funded
p76
aVby product placement, marketing and advertising.
p77
aVSo the movie will be called "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."
p78
aVSo what happens in "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,"
p79
aVis that everything from top to bottom, from start to finish,
p80
aVis branded from beginning to end \u2014
p81
aVfrom the above-the-title sponsor that you'll see in the movie,
p82
aVwhich is brand X.
p83
aVNow this brand, the Qualcomm Stadium,
p84
aVthe Staples Center ...
p85
aVthese people will be married to the film in perpetuity \u2014 forever.
p86
aVAnd so the film explores this whole idea \u2014 (Michael Kassan: It's redundant.)
p87
aVIt's what? (MK: It's redundant.) In perpetuity, forever?
p88
aVI'm a redundant person. (MK: I'm just saying.)
p89
aVThat was more for emphasis.
p90
aVIt was, "In perpetuity. Forever."
p91
aVBut not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor,
p92
aVbut we're going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film.
p93
aVSo maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ...
p94
aVthe greatest car you ever drove from "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,"
p95
aVthe greatest drink you've ever had, courtesy of "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."
p96
aa(lp97
VXavier Kochhar: So the idea is,
p98
aVbeyond just showing that brands are a part of your life,
p99
aVbut actually get them to finance the film? (MS: Get them to finance the film.)
p100
aa(lp101
VMS: And actually we show the whole process of how does it work.
p102
aVThe goal of this whole film is transparency.
p103
aVYou're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie.
p104
aVSo that's the whole concept,
p105
aVthe whole film, start to finish.
p106
aVAnd I would love for CEG to help make it happen.
p107
aa(lp108
VRobert Friedman: You know it's funny,
p109
aVbecause when I first hear it,
p110
aVit is the ultimate respect
p111
aVfor an audience.
p112
aa(lp113
VGuy: I don't know how receptive
p114
aVpeople are going to be to it, though.
p115
aa(lp116
VXK: Do you have a perspective \u2014
p117
aVI don't want to use "angle" because that has a negative connotation \u2014
p118
aVbut do you know how this is going to play out? (MS: No idea.)
p119
aa(lp120
VDavid Cohn: How much money does it take to do this?
p121
aa(lp122
VMS: 1.5 million. (DC: Okay.)
p123
aa(lp124
VJohn Kamen: I think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with them,
p125
aVbut I think it's certainly worth pursuing
p126
aVa couple big, really obvious brands.
p127
aa(lp128
VXK: Who knows, maybe by the time your film comes out,
p129
aVwe look like a bunch of blithering idiots.
p130
aa(lp131
VMS: What do you think the response is going to be?
p132
aa(lp133
VStuart Ruderfer: The responses mostly will be "no."
p134
aa(lp135
VMS: But is it a tough sell because of the film
p136
aVor a tough sell because of me?
p137
aa(lp138
VJK: Both.
p139
aa(lp140
VMS: ... Meaning not so optimistic.
p141
aVSo, sir, can you help me? I need help.
p142
aa(lp143
VMK: I can help you.
p144
aa(lp145
VMS: Okay. (MK: Good.)
p146
aVAwesome.
p147
aa(lp148
VMK: We've gotta figure out which brands.
p149
aa(lp150
VMS: Yeah. (MK: That's the challenge.)
p151
aVWhen you look at the people you deal with ..
p152
aa(lp153
VMK: We've got some places we can go. (MS: Okay.)
p154
aVTurn the camera off.
p155
aa(lp156
VMS: I thought "Turn the camera off"
p157
aVmeant, "Let's have an off-the-record conversation."
p158
aVTurns out it really means,
p159
aV"We want nothing to do with your movie."
p160
aa(lp161
VMS: And just like that, one by one,
p162
aVall of these companies suddenly disappeared.
p163
aVNone of them wanted anything to do with this movie.
p164
aVI was amazed.
p165
aVThey wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project.
p166
aVAnd I was blown away, because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising,
p167
aVwas to get your product out in front of as many people as possible,
p168
aVto get as many people to see it as possible.
p169
aVEspecially in today's world,
p170
aVthis intersection of new media and old media
p171
aVand the fractured media landscape,
p172
aVisn't the idea to get
p173
aVthat new buzz-worthy delivery vehicle
p174
aVthat's going to get that message to the masses?
p175
aVNo, that's what I thought.
p176
aa(lp177
VBut the problem was, you see,
p178
aVmy idea had one fatal flaw,
p179
aVand that flaw was this.
p180
aVActually no, that was not the flaw whatsoever.
p181
aVThat wouldn't have been a problem at all.
p182
aVThis would have been fine.
p183
aVBut what this image represents was the problem.
p184
aVSee, when you do a Google image search for transparency,
p185
aVthis is \u2014-
p186
aV(Laughter)
p187
aV(Applause)
p188
aVThis is one of the first images that comes up.
p189
aVSo I like the way you roll, Sergey Brin. No.
p190
aV(Laughter)
p191
aVThis is was the problem: transparency \u2014
p192
aVfree from pretense or deceit;
p193
aVeasily detected or seen through;
p194
aVreadily understood;
p195
aVcharacterized by visibility or accessibility of information,
p196
aVespecially concerning business practices \u2014
p197
aVthat last line being probably the biggest problem.
p198
aVYou see, we hear a lot about transparency these days.
p199
aVOur politicians say it, our president says it,
p200
aVeven our CEO's say it.
p201
aVBut suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality,
p202
aVsomething suddenly changes.
p203
aVBut why? Well, transparency is scary \u2014
p204
aV(Roar)
p205
aVlike that odd, still-screaming bear.
p206
aV(Laughter)
p207
aVIt's unpredictable \u2014
p208
aV(Music)
p209
aV(Laughter)
p210
aVlike this odd country road.
p211
aVAnd it's also very risky.
p212
aV(Laughter)
p213
aVWhat else is risky?
p214
aVEating an entire bowl of Cool Whip.
p215
aV(Laughter)
p216
aVThat's very risky.
p217
aa(lp218
VNow when I started talking to companies
p219
aVand telling them that we wanted to tell this story,
p220
aVand they said, "No, we want you to tell a story.
p221
aVWe want you to tell a story,
p222
aVbut we just want to tell our story."
p223
aVSee, when I was a kid
p224
aVand my father would catch me in some sort of a lie \u2014
p225
aVand there he is giving me the look he often gave me \u2014
p226
aVhe would say, "Son, there's three sides to every story.
p227
aVThere's your story,
p228
aVthere's my story
p229
aVand there's the real story."
p230
aVNow you see, with this film, we wanted to tell the real story.
p231
aVBut with only one company, one agency willing to help me \u2014
p232
aVand that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years \u2014
p233
aVI realized that I would have to go on my own,
p234
aVI'd have to cut out the middleman
p235
aVand go to the companies myself with all of my team.
p236
aVSo what you suddenly started to realize \u2014
p237
aVor what I started to realize \u2014
p238
aVis that when you started having conversations with these companies,
p239
aVthe idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Video) MS: I have friends who make great big, giant Hollywood films,
p242
aVand I have friends who make little independent films like I make.
p243
aVAnd the friends of mine who make big, giant Hollywood movies
p244
aVsay the reason their films are so successful
p245
aVis because of the brand partners that they have.
p246
aVAnd then my friends who make small independent films
p247
aVsay, "Well, how are we supposed to compete
p248
aVwith these big, giant Hollywood movies?"
p249
aVAnd the movie is called
p250
aV"The Greatest Movie Ever Sold."
p251
aVSo how specifically will we see Ban in the film?
p252
aVAny time I'm ready to go, any time I open up my medicine cabinet,
p253
aVyou will see Ban deodorant.
p254
aVWhile anytime I do an interview with someone,
p255
aVI can say, "Are you fresh enough for this interview?
p256
aVAre you ready? You look a little nervous.
p257
aVI want to help you calm down.
p258
aVSo maybe you should put some one before the interview."
p259
aVSo we'll offer one of these fabulous scents.
p260
aVWhether it's a "Floral Fusion" or a "Paradise Winds,"
p261
aVthey'll have their chance.
p262
aVWe will have them geared for both male or female \u2014
p263
aVsolid, roll-on or stick, whatever it may be.
p264
aVThat's the two-cent tour.
p265
aVSo now I can answer any of your questions
p266
aVand give you the five-cent tour.
p267
aa(lp268
VKaren Frank: We are a smaller brand.
p269
aVMuch like you talked about being a smaller movie,
p270
aVwe're very much a challenger brand.
p271
aVSo we don't have the budgets that other brands have.
p272
aVSo doing things like this \u2014 you know,
p273
aVremind people about Ban \u2014
p274
aVis kind of why were interested in it.
p275
aa(lp276
VMS: What are the words that you would use to describe Ban?
p277
aVBan is blank.
p278
aa(lp279
VKF: That's a great question.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
VWoman: Superior technology.
p284
aa(lp285
VMS: Technology's not the way you want to describe something
p286
aVsomebody's putting in their armpit.
p287
aa(lp288
VMan: We talk about bold, fresh.
p289
aVI think "fresh" is a great word that really spins this category into the positive,
p290
aVversus "fights odor and wetness."
p291
aVIt keeps you fresh.
p292
aVHow do we keep you fresher longer \u2014 better freshness,
p293
aVmore freshness, three times fresher.
p294
aVThings like that that are more of that positive benefit.
p295
aa(lp296
VMS: And that's a multi-million dollar corporation.
p297
aVWhat about me? What about a regular guy?
p298
aVI need to go talk to the man on the street,
p299
aVthe people who are like me, the regular Joes.
p300
aVThey need to tell me about my brand.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Video) MS: How would you guys describe your brand?
p303
aa(lp304
VMan: Um, my brand?
p305
aVI don't know.
p306
aVI like really nice clothes.
p307
aa(lp308
VWoman: 80's revival
p309
aVmeets skater-punk,
p310
aVunless it's laundry day.
p311
aa(lp312
VMS: All right, what is brand Gerry?
p313
aa(lp314
VGerry: Unique. (MS: Unique.)
p315
aa(lp316
VMan: I guess what kind of genre, style I am
p317
aVwould be like dark glamor.
p318
aVI like a lot of black colors,
p319
aVa lot of grays and stuff like that.
p320
aVBut usually I have an accessory,
p321
aVlike sunglasses,
p322
aVor I like crystal and things like that too.
p323
aa(lp324
VWoman: If Dan were a brand,
p325
aVhe might be a classic convertible
p326
aVMercedes Benz.
p327
aa(lp328
VMan 2: The brand that I am
p329
aVis, I would call it casual fly.
p330
aa(lp331
VWoman 2: Part hippie, part yogi,
p332
aVpart Brooklyn girl \u2014 I don't know.
p333
aa(lp334
VMan 3: I'm the pet guy.
p335
aVI sell pet toys all over the country, all over the world.
p336
aVSo I guess that's my brand.
p337
aVIn my warped little industry, that's my brand.
p338
aa(lp339
VMan 4: My brand is FedEx because I deliver the goods.
p340
aa(lp341
VMan 5: Failed writer-alcoholic brand.
p342
aVIs that something?
p343
aa(lp344
VLawyer: I'm a lawyer brand.
p345
aa(lp346
VTom: I'm Tom.
p347
aa(lp348
VMS: Well we can't all be brand Tom, but I do often find myself
p349
aVat the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly.
p350
aa(lp351
V(Laughter)
p352
aa(lp353
VAnd what I realized is I needed an expert.
p354
aVI needed somebody who could get inside my head,
p355
aVsomebody who could really help me understand
p356
aVwhat they call your "brand personality."
p357
aVAnd so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg.
p358
aVThey've helped companies like Nestle, Febreze, Hallmark
p359
aVdiscover that brand personality.
p360
aVIf they could do it for them, surely they could do it for me.
p361
aa(lp362
V(Video) Abigail: You brought your pictures, right?
p363
aa(lp364
VMS: I did. The very first picture
p365
aVis a picture of my family.
p366
aa(lp367
VA: So tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are.
p368
aa(lp369
VMS: These are the people who shape the way I look at the world.
p370
aa(lp371
VA: Tell me about this world.
p372
aa(lp373
VMS: This world? I think your world is the world that you live in \u2014
p374
aVlike people who are around you, your friends, your family,
p375
aVthe way you live your life, the job you do.
p376
aVAll those things stemmed and started from one place,
p377
aVand for me they stemmed and started with my family in West Virginia.
p378
aa(lp379
VA: What's the next one you want to talk about?
p380
aa(lp381
VMS: The next one: This was the best day ever.
p382
aa(lp383
VA: How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are?
p384
aa(lp385
VMS: It's like, who do I want to be?
p386
aVI like things that are different.
p387
aVI like things that are weird. I like weird things.
p388
aa(lp389
VA: Tell me about the "why" phase \u2014 what does that do for us?
p390
aVWhat is the machete? What pupa stage are you in now?
p391
aVWhy is it important to reboot? What does the red represent?
p392
aVTell me a little bit about that part.
p393
aV... A little more about you that is not who you are.
p394
aVWhat are some other metamorphoses that you've had?
p395
aV... Doesn't have to be fear. What kind of roller coaster are you on?
p396
aa(lp397
VMS: EEEEEE! (A: Thank you.) No, thank you.
p398
aa(lp399
VA: Thanks for you patience. (MS: Great job.)
p400
aa(lp401
VA: Yeah. (MS: Thanks a lot.) All right.
p402
aa(lp403
VMS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come of this.
p404
aVThere was a whole lot of crazy going on in there.
p405
aa(lp406
VLindsay Zaltman: The first thing we saw was this idea
p407
aVthat you had two distinct, but complementary
p408
aVsides to your brand personality \u2014
p409
aVthe Morgan Spurlock brand is a mindful/play brand.
p410
aVThose are juxtaposed very nicely together.
p411
aVAnd I think there's almost a paradox with those.
p412
aVAnd I think some companies
p413
aVwill just focus on one of their strengths or the other
p414
aVinstead of focusing on both.
p415
aVMost companies tend to \u2014 and it's human nature \u2014
p416
aVto avoid things that they're not sure of,
p417
aVavoid fear, those elements,
p418
aVand you really embrace those,
p419
aVand you actually turn them into positives for you, and it's a neat thing to see.
p420
aVWhat other brands are like that?
p421
aVThe first on here is the classic, Apple.
p422
aVAnd you can see here too, Target, Wii,
p423
aVMini from the Mini Coopers, and JetBlue.
p424
aVNow there's playful brands and mindful brands,
p425
aVthose things that have come and gone,
p426
aVbut a playful, mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing.
p427
aa(lp428
VMS: A playful, mindful brand. What is your brand?
p429
aVIf somebody asked you to describe your brand identity, your brand personality,
p430
aVwhat would you be?
p431
aVAre you an up attribute? Are you something that gets the blood flowing?
p432
aVOr are you more of a down attribute?
p433
aVAre you something that's a little more calm, reserved, conservative?
p434
aVUp attributes are things like being playful,
p435
aVbeing fresh like the Fresh Prince,
p436
aVcontemporary, adventurous,
p437
aVedgy or daring like Errol Flynn,
p438
aVnimble or agile, profane, domineering,
p439
aVmagical or mystical like Gandalf.
p440
aVOr are you more of a down attribute?
p441
aVAre you mindful, sophisticated like 007?
p442
aVAre you established, traditional, nurturing, protective,
p443
aVempathetic like the Oprah?
p444
aVAre you reliable, stable, familiar,
p445
aVsafe, secure, sacred,
p446
aVcontemplative or wise
p447
aVlike the Dalai Lama or Yoda?
p448
aa(lp449
VOver the course of this film,
p450
aVwe had 500-plus companies
p451
aVwho were up and down companies
p452
aVsaying, "no," they didn't want any part of this project.
p453
aVThey wanted nothing to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control,
p454
aVthey would have no control over the final product.
p455
aVBut we did get 17 brand partners
p456
aVwho were willing to relinquish that control,
p457
aVwho wanted to be in business
p458
aVwith someone as mindful and as playful as myself
p459
aVand who ultimately empowered us to tell stories
p460
aVthat normally we wouldn't be able to tell \u2014
p461
aVstories that an advertiser would normally never get behind.
p462
aa(lp463
VThey enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing,
p464
aVas we got into telling the story in this film
p465
aVabout how now they're using MRI's
p466
aVto target the desire centers of your brain
p467
aVfor both commercials as well as movie marketing.
p468
aVWe went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising.
p469
aVIn the entire city for the past five years,
p470
aVthere's no billboards, there's no posters, there's no flyers, nothing.
p471
aV(Applause)
p472
aVAnd we went to school districts
p473
aVwhere now companies are making their way
p474
aVinto cash-strapped schools all across America.
p475
aVWhat's incredible for me is the projects that I've gotten the most feedback out of,
p476
aVor I've had the most success in,
p477
aVare ones where I've interacted with things directly.
p478
aa(lp479
VAnd that's what these brands did.
p480
aVThey cut out the middleman, they cut out their agencies
p481
aVand said, "Maybe these agencies
p482
aVdon't have my best interest in mind.
p483
aVI'm going to deal directly with the artist.
p484
aVI'm going to work with him to create something different,
p485
aVsomething that's going to get people thinking,
p486
aVthat's going to challenge the way we look at the world."
p487
aa(lp488
VAnd how has that been for them? Has it been successful?
p489
aVWell, since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, let's take a look.
p490
aVAccording to Burrelles, the movie premiered in January,
p491
aVand since then \u2014 and this isn't even the whole thing \u2014
p492
aVwe've had 900 million media impressions for this film.
p493
aVThat's literally covering just like a two and a half-week period.
p494
aVThat's only online \u2014 no print, no TV.
p495
aVThe film hasn't even been distributed yet.
p496
aVIt's not even online. It's not even streaming.
p497
aVIt's not even been out into other foreign countries yet.
p498
aVSo ultimately,
p499
aVthis film has already started to gain a lot of momentum.
p500
aVAnd not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to
p501
aVadvised their clients not to take part.
p502
aa(lp503
VWhat I always believe
p504
aVis that if you take chances, if you take risks,
p505
aVthat in those risks will come opportunity.
p506
aVI believe that when you push people away from that,
p507
aVyou're pushing them more towards failure.
p508
aVI believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse,
p509
aVthen you're preparing your whole company
p510
aVto be reward challenged.
p511
aVI feel like that what has to happen moving forward
p512
aVis we need to encourage people to take risks.
p513
aVWe need to encourage people to not be afraid
p514
aVof opportunities that may scare them.
p515
aVUltimately, moving forward,
p516
aVI think we have to embrace fear.
p517
aVWe've got to put that bear in a cage.
p518
aV(Laughter)
p519
aVEmbrace fear. Embrace risk.
p520
aVOne big spoonful at a time, we have to embrace risk.
p521
aa(lp522
VAnd ultimately, we have to embrace transparency.
p523
aVToday, more than ever,
p524
aVa little honesty is going to go a long way.
p525
aVAnd that being said, through honesty and transparency,
p526
aVmy entire talk, "Embrace Transparency,"
p527
aVhas been brought to you
p528
aVby my good friends at EMC,
p529
aVwho for $7,100
p530
aVbought the naming rights on eBay.
p531
aV(Applause)
p532
aVEMC: Turning big data
p533
aVinto big opportunity
p534
aVfor organizations all over the world.
p535
aVEMC presents: "Embrace Transparency."

VJune Cohen: So, Morgan,
p542
aVin the name of transparency,
p543
aVwhat exactly happened to that $7,100?
p544
aVMS: That is a fantastic question.
p545
aVI have in my pocket a check
p546

p547
aVthe Sapling Foundation \u2014
