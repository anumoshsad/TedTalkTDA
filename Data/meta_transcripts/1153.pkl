VI want to share with you
p4
aVover the next 18 minutes
p5
aVa pretty incredible idea.
p6
aVActually, it's a really big idea.
p7
aVBut to get us started,
p8
aVI want to ask if everyone
p9
aVcould just close your eyes for two seconds
p10
aVand try and think of a technology or a bit of science
p11
aVthat you think has changed the world.
p12
aVNow I bet, in this audience,
p13
aVyou're thinking of some really incredible technology,
p14
aVsome stuff that I haven't even heard of,
p15
aVI'm absolutely sure.
p16
aVBut I'm also sure, pretty sure,
p17
aVthat absolutely nobody is thinking of this.
p18
aVThis is a polio vaccine.
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd it's a great thing actually
p21
aVthat nobody's had to think about it here today
p22
aVbecause it means that we can take this for granted.
p23
aVThis is a great technology.
p24
aVWe can take it completely for granted.
p25
aVBut it wasn't always that way.
p26
aVEven here in California,
p27
aVif we were to go back just a few years,
p28
aVit was a very different story.
p29
aVPeople were terrified of this disease.
p30
aVThey were terrified of polio, and it would cause public panic.
p31
aVAnd it was because of scenes like this.
p32
aVIn this scene,
p33
aVpeople are living in an iron lung.
p34
aVThese are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before,
p35
aVand then two days later,
p36
aVthey can no longer breathe,
p37
aVand this polio virus has paralyzed
p38
aVnot only their arms and their legs,
p39
aVbut also their breathing muscles.
p40
aVAnd they were going to spend the rest of their lives, usually,
p41
aVin this iron lung to breathe for them.
p42
aa(lp43
VThis disease was terrifying.
p44
aVThere was no cure,
p45
aVand there was no vaccine.
p46
aVThe disease was so terrifying
p47
aVthat the president of the United States
p48
aVlaunched an extraordinary national effort
p49
aVto find a way to stop it.
p50
aVTwenty years later, they succeeded
p51
aVand developed the polio vaccine.
p52
aVIt was hailed as a scientific miracle
p53
aVin the late 1950s.
p54
aVFinally, a vaccine that could stop this awful disease,
p55
aVand here in the United States
p56
aVit had an incredible impact.
p57
aVAs you can see, the virus stopped,
p58
aVand it stopped very, very fast.
p59
aa(lp60
VBut this wasn't the case
p61
aVeverywhere in the world.
p62
aVAnd it happened so fast in the United States, however,
p63
aVthat even just last month Jon Stewart said this:
p64
aa(lp65
V(Video) Jon Stewart: Where is polio still active?
p66
aVBecause I thought that had been eradicated
p67
aVin the way that smallpox had been eradicated.
p68
aa(lp69
VBruce Aylward: Oops. Jon, polio's almost been eradicated.
p70
aVBut the reality is
p71
aVthat polio still exists today.
p72
aVWe made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists.
p73
aVThis is the picture.
p74
aVThere's not very much left in the world.
p75
aVBut the reason there's not very much left
p76
aVis because there's been an extraordinary public/private partnership
p77
aVworking behind the scenes, almost unknown,
p78
aVI'm sure to most of you here today.
p79
aVIt's been working for 20 years
p80
aVto try and eradicate this disease,
p81
aVand it's got it down to these few cases
p82
aVthat you can see here on this graphic.
p83
aa(lp84
VBut just last year,
p85
aVwe had an incredible shock
p86
aVand realized that almost just isn't good enough
p87
aVwith a virus like polio.
p88
aVAnd this is the reason:
p89
aVin two countries
p90
aVthat hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade,
p91
aVon opposite sides of the globe,
p92
aVthere was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks.
p93
aVHundreds of people were paralyzed.
p94
aVHundreds of people died \u2014
p95
aVchildren as well as adults.
p96
aVAnd in both cases,
p97
aVwe were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses,
p98
aVand we could tell these viruses were not from these countries.
p99
aVThey had come from thousands of miles away.
p100
aVAnd in one case, it originated on another continent.
p101
aVAnd not only that, but when they came into these countries,
p102
aVthen they got on commercial jetliners probably
p103
aVand they traveled even farther
p104
aVto other places like Russia,
p105
aVwhere, for the first time in over a decade last year,
p106
aVchildren were crippled and paralyzed
p107
aVby a disease that they had not seen for years.
p108
aa(lp109
VNow all of these outbreaks that I just showed you,
p110
aVthese are under control now,
p111
aVand it looks like they'll probably stop very, very quickly.
p112
aVBut the message was very clear.
p113
aVPolio is still
p114
aVa devastating, explosive disease.
p115
aVIt's just happening in another part of the world.
p116
aVAnd our big idea
p117
aVis that the scientific miracle of this decade
p118
aVshould be the complete eradication
p119
aVof poliomyelitis.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo I want to tell you a little bit
p122
aVabout what this partnership, the Polio Partnership,
p123
aVis trying to do.
p124
aVWe're not trying to control polio.
p125
aVWe're not trying to get it down to just a few cases,
p126
aVbecause this disease is like a root fire;
p127
aVit can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely.
p128
aVSo what we're looking for
p129
aVis a permanent solution.
p130
aVWe want a world in which every child, just like you guys,
p131
aVcan take for granted
p132
aVa polio-free world.
p133
aVSo we're looking for a permanent solution,
p134
aVand this is where we get lucky.
p135
aVThis is one of the very few viruses in the world
p136
aVwhere there are big enough cracks in its armor
p137
aVthat we can try to do something truly extraordinary.
p138
aVThis virus can only survive in people.
p139
aVIt can't live for a very long time in people.
p140
aVIt doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all.
p141
aVAnd we've got pretty good vaccines, as I've just showed you.
p142
aVSo we are trying
p143
aVto wipe out this virus completely.
p144
aVWhat the polio eradication program is trying to do
p145
aVis to kill the virus itself
p146
aVthat causes polio
p147
aVeverywhere on Earth.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow we don't have a great track record
p150
aVwhen it comes to doing something like this,
p151
aVto eradicating diseases.
p152
aVIt's been tried six times in the last century,
p153
aVand it's been successful exactly once.
p154
aVAnd this is because disease eradication,
p155
aVit's still the venture capital of public health.
p156
aVThe risks are massive,
p157
aVbut the pay-off \u2014
p158
aVeconomic, humanitarian, motivational \u2014
p159
aVit's absolutely huge.
p160
aVOne congressman here in the United States
p161
aVthinks that the entire investment
p162
aVthat the U.S. put into smallpox eradication
p163
aVpays itself off every 26 days \u2014
p164
aVin foregone treatment costs
p165
aVand vaccination costs.
p166
aVAnd if we can finish polio eradication,
p167
aVthe poorest countries in the world
p168
aVare going to save over 50 billion dollars
p169
aVin the next 25 years alone.
p170
aVSo those are the kind of stakes that we're after.
p171
aa(lp172
VBut smallpox eradication was hard;
p173
aVit was very, very hard.
p174
aVAnd polio eradication, in many ways, is even tougher,
p175
aVand there's a few reasons for that.
p176
aVThe first is that,
p177
aVwhen we started trying to eradicate polio
p178
aVabout 20 years ago,
p179
aVmore than twice as many countries were infected
p180
aVthan had been when we started off with smallpox.
p181
aVAnd there were more than 10 times as many people
p182
aVliving in these countries.
p183
aVSo it was a massive effort.
p184
aVThe second challenge we had was \u2014
p185
aVin contrast to the smallpox vaccine,
p186
aVwhich was very stable, and a single dose protected you for life \u2014
p187
aVthe polio vaccine is incredibly fragile.
p188
aVIt deteriorates so quickly in the tropics
p189
aVthat we've had to put this special vaccine monitor
p190
aVon every single vial
p191
aVso that it will change very quickly
p192
aVwhen it's exposed to too much heat,
p193
aVand we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child \u2014
p194
aVit's not potent; it's not going to protect them.
p195
aVEven then, kids need many doses of the vaccine.
p196
aa(lp197
VBut the third challenge we have \u2014
p198
aVand probably even bigger one, the biggest challenge \u2014
p199
aVis that, in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy \u2014
p200
aVevery single person almost who was infected with smallpox
p201
aVhad this telltale rash.
p202
aVSo you could get around the disease;
p203
aVyou could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off.
p204
aVWith polio it's almost completely different.
p205
aVThe vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus
p206
aVshow absolutely no sign of the disease.
p207
aVSo you can't see the enemy most of the time,
p208
aVand as a result,
p209
aVwe've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio
p210
aVthan what was done with smallpox.
p211
aa(lp212
VWe've had to create
p213
aVone of the largest social movements in history.
p214
aVThere's over 10 million people,
p215
aVprobably 20 million people,
p216
aVlargely volunteers,
p217
aVwho have been working over the last 20 years
p218
aVin what has now been called
p219
aVthe largest internationally-coordinated operation in peacetime.
p220
aVThese people, these 20 million people,
p221
aVvaccinate over 500 million children
p222
aVevery single year,
p223
aVmultiple times
p224
aVat the peak of our operation.
p225
aVNow giving the polio vaccine is simple.
p226
aVIt's just two drops, like that.
p227
aVBut reaching 500 million people
p228
aVis much, much tougher.
p229
aVAnd these vaccinators, these volunteers,
p230
aVthey have got to dive headlong
p231
aVinto some of the toughest, densest
p232
aVurban slums in the world.
p233
aVThey've got to trek under sweltering suns
p234
aVto some of the most remote, difficult to reach places in the world.
p235
aVAnd they also have to dodge bullets,
p236
aVbecause we have got to operate
p237
aVduring shaky cease-fires and truces
p238
aVto try and vaccinate children,
p239
aVeven in areas affected by conflict.
p240
aa(lp241
VOne reporter
p242
aVwho was watching our program in Somalia about five years ago \u2014
p243
aVa place which has eradicated polio,
p244
aVnot once, but twice, because they got reinfected.
p245
aVHe was sitting outside of the road,
p246
aVwatching one of these polio campaigns unfold,
p247
aVand a few months later he wrote:
p248
aV"This is foreign aid at its most heroic."
p249
aVAnd these heroes, they come from every walk of life,
p250
aVall sorts of backgrounds.
p251
aVBut one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International.
p252
aVThis is a group
p253
aVwhose million-strong army of volunteers
p254
aVhave been working to eradicate polio
p255
aVfor over 20 years.
p256
aVThey're right at the center of the whole thing.
p257
aa(lp258
VNow it took years to build up the infrastructure
p259
aVfor polio eradication \u2014
p260
aVmore than 15 years, much longer than it should have \u2014
p261
aVbut once it was built, the results were striking.
p262
aVWithin a couple of years,
p263
aVevery country that started polio eradication
p264
aVrapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses,
p265
aVwith the exception of four countries that you see here.
p266
aVAnd in each of those, it was only part of the country.
p267
aVAnd then, by 1999,
p268
aVone of the three polio viruses
p269
aVthat we were trying to eradicate
p270
aVhad been completely eradicated worldwide \u2014
p271
aVproof of concept.
p272
aVAnd then today,
p273
aVthere's been a 99 percent reduction \u2014
p274
aVgreater than 99 percent reduction \u2014
p275
aVin the number of children
p276
aVwho are being paralyzed by this awful disease.
p277
aVWhen we started, over 20 years ago,
p278
aV1,000 children were being paralyzed
p279
aVevery single day by this virus.
p280
aVLast year, it was 1,000.
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd at the same time,
p283
aVthe polio eradication program
p284
aVhas been working to help with a lot of other areas.
p285
aVIt's been working to help control pandemic flu,
p286
aVSARS for example.
p287
aVIt's also tried to save children by doing other things \u2014
p288
aVgiving vitamin A drops, giving measles shots,
p289
aVgiving bed nets against malaria even
p290
aVduring some of these campaigns.
p291
aVBut the most exciting thing
p292
aVthat the polio eradication program has been doing
p293
aVhas been to force us,
p294
aVthe international community,
p295
aVto reach every single child, every single community,
p296
aVthe most vulnerable people in the world,
p297
aVwith the most basic of health services,
p298
aVirrespective of geography, poverty,
p299
aVculture and even conflict.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo things were looking very exciting,
p302
aVand then about five years ago,
p303
aVthis virus, this ancient virus, started to fight back.
p304
aVThe first problem we ran into
p305
aVwas that, in these last four countries, the strongholds of this virus,
p306
aVwe just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out.
p307
aVAnd then to make the matters even worse,
p308
aVthe virus started to spread out of these four places,
p309
aVespecially northern India and northern Nigeria,
p310
aVinto much of Africa, Asia, and even into Europe,
p311
aVcausing horrific outbreaks
p312
aVin places that had not seen this disease for decades.
p313
aVAnd then,
p314
aVin one of the most important, tenacious
p315
aVand toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world,
p316
aVwe found that our vaccine was working
p317
aVhalf as well as it should have.
p318
aVIn conditions like this,
p319
aVthe vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to
p320
aVin the guts of these children
p321
aVand protect them the way that it needed to.
p322
aa(lp323
VNow at that time,
p324
aVthere was a great, as you can imagine,
p325
aVfrustration \u2014 let's call it frustration \u2014
p326
aVit started to grow very, very quickly.
p327
aVAnd all of a sudden, some very important voices
p328
aVin the world of public health
p329
aVstarted to say, "Hang on.
p330
aVWe should abandon this idea of eradication.
p331
aVLet's settle for control \u2014 that's good enough."
p332
aVNow as seductive as the idea of control sounds,
p333
aVit's a false premise.
p334
aVThe brutal truth is,
p335
aVif we don't have the will or the skill,
p336
aVor even the money that we need
p337
aVto reach children, the most vulnerable children in the world,
p338
aVwith something as simple
p339
aVas an oral polio vaccine,
p340
aVthen pretty soon,
p341
aVmore than 200,000 children
p342
aVare again going to be paralyzed by this disease
p343
aVevery single year.
p344
aVThere's absolutely no question.
p345
aa(lp346
VThese are children like Umar.
p347
aVUmar is seven years old,
p348
aVand he's from northern Nigeria.
p349
aVHe lives in a family home there
p350
aVwith his eight brothers and sisters.
p351
aVUmar also has polio.
p352
aVUmar was paralyzed for life.
p353
aVHis right leg was paralyzed
p354
aVin 2004.
p355
aVThis leg, his right leg,
p356
aVnow takes an awful beating
p357
aVbecause he has to half-crawl,
p358
aVbecause it's faster to move that way
p359
aVto keep up with his friends, keep up with his brothers and sisters,
p360
aVthan to get up on his crutches and walk.
p361
aVBut Umar is a fantastic student. He's an incredible kid.
p362
aVAs you probably can't see the detail here,
p363
aVbut this is his report card,
p364
aVand you'll see, he's got perfect scores.
p365
aVHe got 100 percent in all the important things,
p366
aVlike nursery rhymes, for example there.
p367
aVBut you know I'd love to be able to tell you
p368
aVthat Umar is a typical kid with polio these days,
p369
aVbut it's not true.
p370
aVUmar is an exceptional kid
p371
aVin exceptional circumstances.
p372
aa(lp373
VThe reality of polio today
p374
aVis something very different.
p375
aVPolio strikes the poorest communities in the world.
p376
aVIt leaves their children paralyzed,
p377
aVand it drags their families
p378
aVdeeper into poverty,
p379
aVbecause they're desperately searching
p380
aVand they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have,
p381
aVtrying in vain
p382
aVto find a cure for their children.
p383
aVWe think children deserve better.
p384
aVAnd so when the going got really tough
p385
aVin the polio eradication program
p386
aVabout two years ago,
p387
aVwhen people were saying, "We should call it off,"
p388
aVthe Polio Partnership
p389
aVdecided to buckle down once again
p390
aVand try and find innovative new solutions,
p391
aVnew ways to get to the children
p392
aVthat we were missing again and again.
p393
aa(lp394
VIn northern India, we started mapping the cases
p395
aVusing satellite imaging like this,
p396
aVso that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters,
p397
aVso we could get to the millions of children
p398
aVon the Koshi River basin
p399
aVwhere there are no other health services.
p400
aVIn northern Nigeria,
p401
aVthe political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders,
p402
aVthey got directly involved in the program
p403
aVto help solve the problems of logistics
p404
aVand community confidence.
p405
aa(lp406
VAnd now they've even started using these devices \u2014
p407
aVspeaking of cool technology \u2014
p408
aVthese little devices, little GIS trackers like this,
p409
aVwhich they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators.
p410
aVAnd then they can track them,
p411
aVand at the end of the day, they look and see,
p412
aVdid these guys get every single street, every single house.
p413
aVThis is the kind of commitment now we're seeing
p414
aVto try and reach all of the children we've been missing.
p415
aVAnd in Afghanistan, we're trying new approaches \u2014
p416
aVaccess negotiators.
p417
aVWe're working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross
p418
aVto ensure that we can reach every child.
p419
aa(lp420
VBut as we tried these extraordinary things,
p421
aVas people went to this trouble
p422
aVto try and rework their tactics,
p423
aVwe went back to the vaccine \u2014 it's a 50-year-old vaccine \u2014
p424
aVand we thought, surely we can make a better vaccine,
p425
aVso that when they finally get to these kids,
p426
aVwe can have a better bang for our buck.
p427
aVAnd this started an incredible collaboration with industry,
p428
aVand within six months,
p429
aVwe were testing a new polio vaccine
p430
aVthat targeted, just two years ago,
p431
aVthe last two types of polio in the world.
p432
aVNow June the ninth, 2009,
p433
aVwe got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine,
p434
aVand it turned out to be a game-changer.
p435
aVThe new vaccine
p436
aVhad twice the impact on these last couple of viruses
p437
aVas the old vaccine had,
p438
aVand we immediately started using this.
p439
aVWell, in a couple of months we had to get it out of production.
p440
aVAnd it started rolling off the production lines
p441
aVand into the mouths of children around the world.
p442
aVAnd we didn't start with the easy places.
p443
aVThe first place this vaccine was used
p444
aVwas in southern Afghanistan,
p445
aVbecause it's in places like that
p446
aVwhere kids are going to benefit the most
p447
aVfrom technologies like this.
p448
aa(lp449
VNow here at TED, over the last couple of days,
p450
aVI've seen people challenging the audience again and again
p451
aVto believe in the impossible.
p452
aVSo this morning at about seven o'clock,
p453
aVI decided that we'd try to drive Chris
p454
aVand the production crew here berserk
p455
aVby downloading all of our data from India again,
p456
aVso that you could see something
p457
aVthat's just unfolding today,
p458
aVwhich proves that the impossible is possible.
p459
aVAnd only two years ago, people were saying that this is impossible.
p460
aVNow remember, northern India is the perfect storm
p461
aVwhen it comes to polio.
p462
aVOver 500,000 children
p463
aVare born in the two states that have never stopped polio \u2014
p464
aVUttar Pradesh and Bihar \u2014

aVSanitation is terrible,
p467
aVand our old vaccine, you remember,
p468
aVworked half as well as it should have.
p469
aVAnd yet, the impossible is happening.
p470
aVToday marks exactly six months \u2014
p471
aVand for the first time in history,
p472
aVnot a single child has been paralyzed

VIndia's not unique.
p478
aVIn Umar's home country of Nigeria,
p479
aVa 95 percent reduction
p480
aVin the number of children paralyzed by polio last year.
p481
aVAnd in the last six months,
p482
aVwe've had less places reinfected by polio
p483
aVthan at any other time in history.
p484
aa(lp485
VLadies and gentlemen, with a combination
p486
aVof smart people, smart technology
p487
aVand smart investments,
p488
aVpolio can now be eradicated anywhere.
p489
aVWe have major challenges, you can imagine,
p490
aVto finish this job,
p491
aVbut as you've also seen,
p492
aVit's doable,
p493
aVit has great secondary benefits,
p494
aVand polio eradication is a great buy.
p495
aVAnd as long as any child anywhere
p496
aVis paralyzed by this virus,
p497
aVit's a stark reminder
p498
aVthat we are failing, as a society, to reach children
p499
aVwith the most basic of services.
p500
aVAnd for that reason, polio eradication:
p501
aVit's the ultimate in equity
p502
aVand it's the ultimate in social justice.
p503
aVThe huge social movement
p504
aVthat's been involved in polio eradication
p505
aVis ready to do way more for these children.
p506
aVIt's ready to reach them with bed nets, with other things.
p507
aVBut capitalizing on their enthusiasm,
p508
aVcapitalizing on their energy
p509
aVmeans finishing the job
p510
aVthat they started 20 years ago.
p511
aa(lp512
VFinishing polio is a smart thing to do,
p513
aVand it's the right thing to do.
p514
aVNow we're in tough times economically.
p515
aVBut as David Cameron of the United Kingdom
p516
aVsaid about a month ago when he was talking about polio,
p517
aV"There's never a wrong time
p518
aVto do the right thing."
p519
aVFinishing polio eradication
p520
aVis the right thing to do.
p521
aVAnd we are at a crossroads right now
p522
aVin this great effort over the last 20 years.
p523
aVWe have a new vaccine,
p524
aVwe have new resolve,
p525
aVand we have new tactics.
p526
aVWe have the chance
p527
aVto write an entirely new polio-free chapter
p528
aVin human history.
p529
aVBut if we blink now,
p530
aVwe will lose forever
p531
aVthe chance to eradicate an ancient disease.
p532
aVHere's a great idea to spread:
p533
aVEnd polio now.
p534
aVHelp us tell the story.
p535
aVHelp us build the momentum
p536
aVso that very soon
p537
aVevery child, every parent
p538
aVeverywhere
p539
aVcan also take for granted
p540
aVa polio-free life forever.

aa(lp549
VBA: The four places where you saw, that we've never stopped \u2014
p550
aVnorthern Nigeria, northern India,
p551
aVthe southern corner of Afghanistan
p552
aVand bordering areas of Pakistan \u2014
p553
aVthey're going to be the toughest.
p554
aVBut the interesting thing is, of those three,
p555
aVIndia's looking real good, as you just saw in the data.
p556
aVAnd Afghanistan, Afghanistan, we think
p557
aVhas probably stopped polio repeatedly.
p558
aVIt keeps getting reinfected.
p559
aVSo the tough ones: going to get the top of Nigeria finished
p560
aVand getting Pakistan finished.
p561
aVThey're going to be the tough ones.
p562
aa(lp563
VBG: Now what about the money?
p564
aVGive us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year.
p565
aVAnd is it easy to raise that money?
p566
aVAnd what's it going to be like the next couple of years?
p567
aa(lp568
VBA: It's interesting.
p569
aVWe spend right now about 750 million
p570
aVto 800 million dollars a year.
p571
aVThat's what it costs to reach 500 million children.
p572
aVIt sounds like a lot of money; it is a lot of money.
p573
aVBut when you're reaching 500 million children multiple times \u2014
p574
aV20, 30 cents to reach a child \u2014
p575
aVthat's not very much money.
p576
aVBut right now we don't have enough of that.
p577
aVWe have a big gap in that money. We're cutting corners,
p578
aVand every time we cut corners,
p579
aVmore places get infected that shouldn't have, and it just slows us down.
p580
aVAnd that great buy costs us a little bit more.
p581
aa(lp582
VBG: Well, hopefully we'll get the word out,
p583
aVand the governments will keep their generosity up.
p584
aVSo good luck. We're all in this with you.
