V"My Air Jordans cost a hundred with tax.
p4
aVMy suede Starters jacket says Raiders on the back.
p5
aVI'm stylin', smilin', lookin' real mean,
p6
aVbecause it ain't about being heard, just being seen.
p7
aVMy leather Adidas baseball cap matches
p8
aVmy fake Gucci backpack. (Laughter)
p9
aVAin't nobody who looks as good as me,
p10
aVbut this costs money, it sure ain't free,
p11
aVand I gots no job, no money at all,
p12
aVbut it's easy to steal all this from the mall.
p13
aVParents say I shouldn't, but I knows I should.
p14
aVGot to do what I can to make sure I look good,
p15
aVand the reason I have to look real good, well, to tell you the truth, man,
p16
aVI don't know why. Guess it makes me feel special inside.
p17
aVWhen I'm wearing fresh gear I don't have to hide,
p18
aVand I really must get some new gear soon
p19
aVor my ego will pop like a 10-cent balloon.
p20
aVBut security is tight at all the shops. Every day there are more and more cops.
p21
aVMy crew is laughing at me because I'm wearing old gear.
p22
aVSchool's almost over. Summer is near.
p23
aVAnd I'm sportin' torn Jordans.
p24
aVI need something new. Only one thing left to do.
p25
aVCut school Friday, catch the subway downtown,
p26
aVcheck out my victims hangin' around.
p27
aVMaybe I'll get lucky and find easy prey.
p28
aVGot to get some new gear. There's no other way.
p29
aVI'm ready and willing. I'm packing my gun.
p30
aVThis is serious business. This ain't no fun.
p31
aVAnd I can't have my posse laughin' at me.
p32
aVI'mma cop something dope, just wait, you'll see.
p33
aVCome out of the station, West 4th near the park,
p34
aVbrothers shooting hoops and someone remarks,
p35
aV'Hey homes, where you get them Nik's?'
p36
aVI says to myself, 'Yeah. I likes 'em, I likes.'
p37
aVThey were Q-tip white, bright and blinding my eyes.
p38
aVThe red emblem of Michael looked as if it could fly.
p39
aVNot one spot of dirt. The Airs were brand new.
p40
aVHad my pistol and knew just what to do.
p41
aVWaited until it was just the right time, followed him very closely behind.
p42
aVHe made a left turn on Houston, I pulled out my gun,
p43
aVand I said, 'Gimme them Jordans!'
p44
aVAnd the punk tried to run.
p45
aVTook off fast, didn't get far. I fired,'Pow!'
p46
aVFool fell between two parked cars.
p47
aVHe was coughing, crying, blood spilled on the street.
p48
aVAnd I snatched them Air Jordans off of his feet.
p49
aVWhile laying there dying, all he could say
p50
aVwas, "Please man, don't take my Air Jordans away."
p51
aVYou'd think he'd be worried about staying alive.
p52
aVAs I took off with his sneakers, there was tears in his eyes.
p53
aVVery next day, I bopped into school
p54
aVwith my brand new Air Jordans, man, I was cool.
p55
aVI killed to get 'em, but hey, I don't care,
p56
aVbecause now I needs a new jacket to wear."
p57
aa(lp58
VThank you. (Applause)
p59
aa(lp60
VFor the last 15 years that I have been performing,
p61
aVall I ever wanted to do was transcend poetry to the world.
p62
aVSee, it wasn't enough for me to write a book.
p63
aVIt wasn't enough for me to join a slam competition,
p64
aVand while those things hold weight,
p65
aVit wasn't the driving force that pushes the pen to the pad.
p66
aVThe hunger and thirst was, and still remains:
p67
aVHow do I get people who hate poetry
p68
aVto love me?
p69
aVBecause I'm an extension of my work,
p70
aVand if they love me, then they will love my work,
p71
aVand if they love my work, then they will love poetry,
p72
aVand if they love poetry, then I will have done my job,
p73
aVwhich is to transcend it to the world.
p74
aa(lp75
VAnd in 1996, I found the answer in principles
p76
aVin a master spoken-word artist named Reg E. Gaines,
p77
aVwho wrote the famous poem, "Please Don't Take My Air Jordans."
p78
aVAnd I followed this guy everywhere until I had him in the room,
p79
aVand I read him one of my pieces,
p80
aVand you know what he told me?
p81
aV"Yo' wack.
p82
aVYou know what the problem is with you, homie?
p83
aVYou don't read other people's poetry,
p84
aVand you don't got any subordination for verbal measures
p85
aVto tonal consideration." (Laughter)
p86
aVNow he kept on rambling
p87
aVabout poetry and styles and Nuyorican Friday nights.
p88
aa(lp89
VNow I could have quit. I should have quit.
p90
aVI mean, I thought poetry was just self-expression.
p91
aVI didn't know you actually have to have creative control.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo instead of quitting, I followed him everywhere.
p94
aVWhen he was writing a Broadway show, I would be outside of the door.
p95
aVI would wake him up at, like, 6:30 in the morning
p96
aVto ask him who's the best poet.
p97
aVI remember eating the eyes of a fish right out of the sea
p98
aVbecause he told me it was brain food.
p99
aa(lp100
VThen one day I told him,
p101
aV"Reg E., what is subordination for verbal measures to tonal consideration?" (Laughter)
p102
aVAnd he handed me a black-and-white printed out thesis
p103
aVon a poet named Etheridge Knight
p104
aVand the oral nature of poetry,
p105
aVand from that point,
p106
aVReggie stopped becoming the best to me,
p107
aVbecause what Etheridge Knight taught me
p108
aVwas that I could make my words sound like music,
p109
aVeven my small ones, the monosyllables,
p110
aVthe ifs, ands, buts, whats,
p111
aVthe gangsta in my slang could fall right on the ear,
p112
aVand from then on, I started chasing Etheridge Knight.
p113
aVI wanted to know which poet he read,
p114
aVand I landed on a poem called ["Dark Prophecy: Sing of Shine"],
p115
aVa toast signifying that got me on the biggest stage
p116
aVa poet could ever be:
p117
aVBroadway, baby.
p118
aVAnd from that point, I learned how to pull the mic away
p119
aVand attack the poetry with my body.
p120
aa(lp121
VBut that wasn't the biggest lesson I ever learned.
p122
aVThe biggest lesson I learned was many years later
p123
aVwhen I went to Beverly Hills and I ran into a talent agent
p124
aVwho looked at me up and down
p125
aVand said I don't look like I have any experience
p126
aVto be working in this business.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd I said to him, "Listen, punk fool,
p129
aVyou're a failed actor who became an agent,
p130
aVand you know why you failed as an actor?
p131
aVBecause people like me took your job.
p132
aVI've traveled all the way from Cleveland and Essex
p133
aVin East New York, took the local 6 line up to the hookers of Hunt's Point
p134
aVwho were in my way on my way to master the art of space,
p135
aVand the one-to-infinite amount of man, woman and child
p136
aVyou can fit in there only so I can push them
p137
aVto the back of the wall with my experience.
p138
aVPeople have bought tickets to my experience
p139
aVand used them as refrigerator magnets to let them know
p140
aVthat the revolution is near, so stock up.
p141
aVI'm so experienced that when you went
p142
aVto a privileged school to learn a Shakespearean sonnet,
p143
aVI was getting those beats kicked and shoved into me.
p144
aVI can master shock of "The Crying Game" with the awe
p145
aVof a child being called an AIDS victim by a bully who didn't know
p146
aVthat it was his father who gave it to my mother,
p147
aVand that's a double entendre.
p148
aVI'm so experienced that when you went to the Fell School
p149
aVand all the rich little fairy boys decided to sponsor a child
p150
aVin it, that was me, but kicked me out when I was caught
p151
aVteaching the fairy boys how to rob the PATS off a pair of Lee Jeans
p152
aVand bring them to VIM. Let me see Chekhov pull that off.
p153
aVSanford Meisner was my Uncle Artie yelling silently to himself,
p154
aV"Something's always wrong when nothing's always right."
p155
aVMethod acting is nothing but a mixture
p156
aVof multiple personalities, believing your own lies are reality,
p157
aVlike in high school cool Kenny telling me he wanted to be a cop.
p158
aVDude, you go to Riker's Island Academy.
p159
aVI could make David Mamet
p160
aVpsychoanalyze my attack on dialogue,
p161
aVStanislavski be as if he were Bruce Lee
p162
aVkicking your roster of talentless students up and down Crenshaw.
p163
aVSo what, your actors studied guerrilla theater at the London Rep?
p164
aVLet me tell you an ancient Chinese Saturday afternoon
p165
aVkung fu secret.
p166
aVBoards don't hit back.
p167
aVYou think black entertainers have it hard finding work
p168
aVin this business? I'm a suspicious mulatto,
p169
aVwhich means I'm too black to be white and too white to be doing it right.
p170
aVForget the American ghetto. I've cracked stages in Soweto,
p171
aVburied abortion babies in potter's field and still managed to keep a smile on my face,
p172
aVso whatever you curse at me to your caddyshack
p173
aVgo-for-this, go-for-that assistant when I walk out that door,
p174
aVwhatever slander you send my way,
p175
aVyour mother.
p176
aVThank you. (Applause)
