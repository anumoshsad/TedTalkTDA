VWe're seen as the organization that is the bucket for failed social policy.
p4
aVI can't define who comes to us or how long they stay.
p5
aVWe get the people for whom nothing else has worked,
p6
aVpeople who have fallen through all
p7
aVof the other social safety nets.
p8
aVThey can't contain them, so we must.
p9
aVThat's our job:
p10
aVcontain them, control them.
p11
aa(lp12
VOver the years, as a prison system,
p13
aVas a nation, and as a society,
p14
aVwe've become very good at that,
p15
aVbut that shouldn't make you happy.
p16
aVToday we incarcerate more people per capita
p17
aVthan any other country in the world.
p18
aVWe have more black men in prison today
p19
aVthan were under slavery in 1850.
p20
aVWe house the parents of almost three million
p21
aVof our community's children,
p22
aVand we've become the new asylum,
p23
aVthe largest mental health provider in this nation.
p24
aVWhen we lock someone up,
p25
aVthat is no small thing.
p26
aVAnd yet, we are called the Department of Corrections.
p27
aVToday I want to talk about
p28
aVchanging the way we think about corrections.
p29
aVI believe, and my experience tells me,
p30
aVthat when we change the way we think,
p31
aVwe create new possibilities, or futures,
p32
aVand prisons need a different future.
p33
aa(lp34
VI've spent my entire career in corrections, over 30 years.
p35
aVI followed my dad into this field.
p36
aVHe was a Vietnam veteran. Corrections suited him.
p37
aVHe was strong, steady, disciplined.
p38
aVI was not so much any of those things,
p39
aVand I'm sure that worried him about me.
p40
aVEventually I decided, if I was going to end up in prison,
p41
aVI'd better end up on the right side of the bars,
p42
aVso I thought I'd check it out,
p43
aVtake a tour of the place my dad worked,
p44
aVthe McNeil Island Penitentiary.
p45
aa(lp46
VNow this was the early '80s,
p47
aVand prisons weren't quite what you see
p48
aVon TV or in the movies.
p49
aVIn many ways, it was worse.
p50
aVI walked into a cell house that was five tiers high.
p51
aVThere were eight men to a cell.
p52
aVthere were 550 men in that living unit.
p53
aVAnd just in case you wondered,
p54
aVthey shared one toilet in those small confines.
p55
aVAn officer put a key in a lockbox,
p56
aVand hundreds of men streamed out of their cells.
p57
aVHundreds of men streamed out of their cells.
p58
aVI walked away as fast as I could.
p59
aa(lp60
VEventually I went back and I started as an officer there.
p61
aVMy job was to run one of those cell blocks
p62
aVand to control those hundreds of men.
p63
aVWhen I went to work at our receptions center,
p64
aVI could actually hear the inmates  roiling from the parking lot,
p65
aVshaking cell doors, yelling,
p66
aVtearing up their cells.
p67
aVTake hundreds of volatile people and lock them up,
p68
aVand what you get is chaos.
p69
aVContain and control \u2014 that was our job.
p70
aa(lp71
VOne way we learned to do this more effectively
p72
aVwas a new type of housing unit
p73
aVcalled the Intensive Management Unit, IMU,
p74
aVa modern version of a "hole."
p75
aVWe put inmates in cells behind solid steel doors
p76
aVwith cuff ports so we could restrain them
p77
aVand feed them.
p78
aVGuess what?
p79
aVIt got quieter.
p80
aVDisturbances died down in the general population.
p81
aVPlaces became safer
p82
aVbecause those inmates who were most violent or disruptive
p83
aVcould now be isolated.
p84
aVBut isolation isn't good.
p85
aVDeprive people of social contact and they deteriorate.
p86
aVIt was hard getting them out of IMU,
p87
aVfor them and for us.
p88
aVEven in prison, it's no small thing
p89
aVto lock someone up.
p90
aa(lp91
VMy next assignment was to one of the state's deep-end prisons
p92
aVwhere some of our more violent or disruptive inmates are housed.
p93
aVBy then, the industry had advanced a lot,
p94
aVand we had different tools and techniques
p95
aVto manage disruptive behavior.
p96
aVWe had beanbag guns and pepper spray
p97
aVand plexiglass shields,
p98
aVflash bangs, emergency response teams.
p99
aVWe met violence with force
p100
aVand chaos with chaos.
p101
aVWe were pretty good at putting out fires.
p102
aa(lp103
VWhile I was there, I met two experienced correctional workers
p104
aVwho were also researchers,
p105
aVan anthropologist and a sociologist.
p106
aVOne day, one of them commented to me and said,
p107
aV"You know, you're pretty good at putting out fires.
p108
aVHave you ever thought about how to prevent them?"
p109
aVI was patient with them,
p110
aVexplaining our brute force approach
p111
aVto making prisons safer.
p112
aVThey were patient with me.
p113
aVOut of those conversations grew some new ideas
p114
aVand we started some small experiments.
p115
aVFirst, we started training our officers in teams
p116
aVrather than sending them one or two at a time to the state training academy.
p117
aVInstead of four weeks of training, we gave them 10.
p118
aVThen we experimented with an apprenticeship model
p119
aVwhere we paired new staff with veteran staff.
p120
aVThey both got better at the work.
p121
aVSecond, we added verbal de-escalation skills
p122
aVinto the training continuum
p123
aVand made it part of the use of force continuum.
p124
aVIt was the non-force use of force.
p125
aVAnd then we did something even more radical.
p126
aVWe trained the inmates on those same skills.
p127
aVWe changed the skill set,
p128
aVreducing violence, not just responding to it.
p129
aa(lp130
VThird, when we expanded our facility,  we tried a new type of design.
p131
aVNow the biggest and most controversial component
p132
aVof this design, of course, was the toilet.
p133
aVThere were no toilets.
p134
aVNow that might not sound significant to you here today,
p135
aVbut at the time, it was huge.
p136
aVNo one had ever heard of a cell without a toilet.
p137
aVWe all thought it was dangerous and crazy.
p138
aVEven eight men to a cell had a toilet.
p139
aVThat small detail changed the way we worked.
p140
aVInmates and staff started interacting
p141
aVmore often and openly and developing a rapport.
p142
aVIt was easier to detect conflict and intervene
p143
aVbefore it escalated.
p144
aVThe unit was cleaner, quieter, safer and more humane.
p145
aVThis was more effective at keeping the peace
p146
aVthan any intimidation technique I'd seen to that point.
p147
aVInteracting changes the way you behave,
p148
aVboth for the officer and the inmate.
p149
aVWe changed the environment and we changed the behavior.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow, just in case I hadn't learned this lesson,
p152
aVthey assigned me to headquarters next,
p153
aVand that's where I ran straight up against system change.
p154
aVNow, many things work against system change:
p155
aVpolitics and politicians, bills and laws,
p156
aVcourts and lawsuits, internal politics.
p157
aVSystem change is difficult and slow,
p158
aVand oftentimes it doesn't take you
p159
aVwhere you want to go.
p160
aVIt's no small thing to change a prison system.
p161
aVSo what I did do is I reflected on my earlier experiences
p162
aVand I remembered that when we interacted with offenders, the heat went down.
p163
aVWhen we changed the environment, the behavior changed.
p164
aVAnd these were not huge system changes.
p165
aVThese were small changes, and these changes
p166
aVcreated new possibilities.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo next, I got reassigned as superintendent of a small prison.
p169
aVAnd at the same time, I was working on my degree
p170
aVat the Evergreen State College.
p171
aVI interacted with a lot of people who were not like me,
p172
aVpeople who had different ideas
p173
aVand came from different backgrounds.
p174
aVOne of them was a rainforest ecologist.
p175
aVShe looked at my small prison and what she saw
p176
aVwas a laboratory.
p177
aVWe talked and discovered how prisons and inmates
p178
aVcould actually help advance science
p179
aVby helping them complete projects
p180
aVthey couldn't complete on their own,
p181
aVlike repopulating endangered species:
p182
aVfrogs, butterflies, endangered prairie plants.
p183
aVAt the same time, we found ways to make
p184
aVour operation more efficient
p185
aVthrough the addition of solar power,
p186
aVrainwater catchment, organic gardening, recycling.
p187
aVThis initiative has led to many projects
p188
aVthat have had huge system-wide impact,
p189
aVnot just in our system, but in  other state systems as well,
p190
aVsmall experiments making a big difference
p191
aVto science, to the community.
p192
aVThe way we think about our work changes our work.
p193
aVThe project just made my job more interesting and exciting.
p194
aVI was excited. Staff were excited.
p195
aVOfficers were excited. Inmates were excited.
p196
aVThey were inspired.
p197
aVEverybody wanted to be part of this.
p198
aVThey were making a contribution, a difference,
p199
aVone they thought was meaningful and important.
p200
aa(lp201
VLet me be clear on what's going on here, though.
p202
aVInmates are highly adaptive.
p203
aVThey have to be.
p204
aVOftentimes, they know more about our own systems
p205
aVthan the people who run them.
p206
aVAnd they're here for a reason.
p207
aVI don't see my job as to punish them or forgive them,
p208
aVbut I do think they can have
p209
aVdecent and meaningful lives even in prison.
p210
aVSo that was the question:
p211
aVCould inmates live decent and meaningful lives,
p212
aVand if so, what difference would that make?
p213
aVSo I took that question back to the deep end,
p214
aVwhere some of our most violent offenders are housed.
p215
aVRemember, IMUs are for punishment.
p216
aVYou don't get perks there, like programming.
p217
aVThat was how we thought.
p218
aVBut then we started to realize that if any inmates
p219
aVneeded programming, it was these particular inmates.
p220
aVIn fact, they needed intensive programming.
p221
aVSo we changed our thinking 180 degrees,
p222
aVand we started looking for new possibilities.
p223
aVWhat we found was a new kind of chair.
p224
aVInstead of using the chair for punishment,
p225
aVwe put it in classrooms.
p226
aVOkay, we didn't forget our responsibility to control,
p227
aVbut now inmates could interact safely, face-to-face
p228
aVwith other inmates and staff,
p229
aVand because control was no longer an issue,
p230
aVeverybody could focus on other things,
p231
aVlike learning. Behavior changed.
p232
aVWe changed our thinking, and we changed  what was possible, and this gives me hope.
p233
aa(lp234
VNow, I can't tell you that any of this stuff will work.
p235
aVWhat I can tell you, though, it is working.
p236
aVOur prisons are getting safer for both staff and inmates,
p237
aVand when our prisons are safe,
p238
aVwe can put our energies into a lot more than just controlling.
p239
aVReducing recidivism may be our ultimate goal,
p240
aVbut it's not our only goal.
p241
aVTo be honest with you, preventing crime
p242
aVtakes so much more from so many more people
p243
aVand institutions.
p244
aVIf we rely on just prisons to reduce crime,
p245
aVI'm afraid we'll never get there.
p246
aVBut prisons can do some things
p247
aVwe never thought they could do.
p248
aVPrisons can be the source of innovation
p249
aVand sustainability,
p250
aVrepopulating endangered species and environmental restoration.
p251
aVInmates can be scientists and beekeepers,
p252
aVdog rescuers.
p253
aVPrisons can be the source of meaningful work
p254
aVand opportunity for staff
p255
aVand the inmates who live there.
p256
aVWe can contain and control
p257
aVand provide humane environments.
p258
aVThese are not opposing qualities.
p259
aa(lp260
VWe can't wait 10 to 20 years to find out
p261
aVif this is worth doing.
p262
aVOur strategy is not massive system change.
p263
aVOur strategy is hundreds of small changes
p264
aVthat take place in days or months, not years.
p265
aVWe need more small pilots where we learn as we go,
p266
aVpilots that change the range of possibility.
p267
aVWe need new and better ways to measure impacts
p268
aVon engagement, on interaction,
p269
aVon safe environments.
p270
aVWe need more opportunities to participate in
p271
aVand contribute to our communities,
p272
aVyour communities.
p273
aVPrisons need to be secure, yes, safe, yes.
p274
aVWe can do that.
p275
aVPrisons need to provide humane environments
p276
aVwhere people can participate, contribute,
p277
aVand learn meaningful lives.
p278
aVWe're learning how to do that.
p279
aa(lp280
VThat's why I'm hopeful.
p281
aVWe don't have to stay stuck in old ideas about prison.
p282
aVWe can define that. We can create that.
p283
aVAnd when we do that thoughtfully and with humanity,
p284
aVprisons can be more than the bucket
p285
aVfor failed social policy.
p286
aVMaybe finally, we will earn our title:
p287
aVa department of corrections.
