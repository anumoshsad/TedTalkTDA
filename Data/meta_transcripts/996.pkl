VI love video games.
p4
aVI'm also slightly in awe of them.
p5
aVI'm in awe of their power
p6
aVin terms of imagination, in terms of technology,
p7
aVin terms of concept.
p8
aVBut I think, above all,
p9
aVI'm in awe at their power
p10
aVto motivate, to compel us,
p11
aVto transfix us,
p12
aVlike really nothing else we've ever invented
p13
aVhas quite done before.
p14
aVAnd I think that we can learn some pretty amazing things
p15
aVby looking at how we do this.
p16
aVAnd in particular, I think we can learn things
p17
aVabout learning.
p18
aVNow the video games industry
p19
aVis far and away the fastest growing
p20
aVof all modern media.
p21
aVFrom about 10 billion in 1990,
p22
aVit's worth 50 billion dollars globally today,
p23
aVand it shows no sign of slowing down.
p24
aVIn four years' time,
p25
aVit's estimated it'll be worth over 80 billion dollars.
p26
aVThat's about three times the recorded music industry.
p27
aVThis is pretty stunning,
p28
aVbut I don't think it's the most telling statistic of all.
p29
aVThe thing that really amazes me
p30
aVis that, today,
p31
aVpeople spend about
p32
aVeight billion real dollars a year
p33
aVbuying virtual items
p34
aVthat only exist
p35
aVinside video games.
p36
aVThis is a screenshot from the virtual game world, Entropia Universe.
p37
aVEarlier this year,
p38
aVa virtual asteroid in it
p39
aVsold for 330,000 real dollars.
p40
aVAnd this
p41
aVis a Titan class ship
p42
aVin the space game, EVE Online.
p43
aVAnd this virtual object
p44
aVtakes 200 real people
p45
aVabout 56 days of real time to build,
p46
aVplus countless thousands of hours
p47
aVof effort before that.
p48
aVAnd yet, many of these get built.
p49
aVAt the other end of the scale,
p50
aVthe game Farmville that you may well have heard of,
p51
aVhas 70 million players
p52
aVaround the world
p53
aVand most of these players
p54
aVare playing it almost every day.
p55
aa(lp56
VThis may all sound
p57
aVreally quite alarming to some people,
p58
aVan index of something worrying
p59
aVor wrong in society.
p60
aVBut we're here for the good news,
p61
aVand the good news is
p62
aVthat I think we can explore
p63
aVwhy this very real human effort,
p64
aVthis very intense generation of value, is occurring.
p65
aVAnd by answering that question,
p66
aVI think we can take something
p67
aVextremely powerful away.
p68
aVAnd I think the most interesting way
p69
aVto think about how all this is going on
p70
aVis in terms of rewards.
p71
aVAnd specifically, it's in terms
p72
aVof the very intense emotional rewards
p73
aVthat playing games offers to people
p74
aVboth individually
p75
aVand collectively.
p76
aVNow if we look at what's going on in someone's head
p77
aVwhen they are being engaged,
p78
aVtwo quite different processes are occurring.
p79
aVOn the one hand, there's the wanting processes.
p80
aVThis is a bit like ambition and drive \u2014 I'm going to do that. I'm going to work hard.
p81
aVOn the other hand, there's the liking processes,
p82
aVfun and affection
p83
aVand delight
p84
aVand an enormous flying beast with an orc on the back.
p85
aVIt's a really great image. It's pretty cool.
p86
aVIt's from the game World of Warcraft with more than 10 million players globally,
p87
aVone of whom is me, another of whom is my wife.
p88
aVAnd this kind of a world,
p89
aVthis vast flying beast you can ride around,
p90
aVshows why games are so very good
p91
aVat doing both the wanting and the liking.
p92
aVBecause it's very powerful. It's pretty awesome.
p93
aVIt gives you great powers.
p94
aVYour ambition is satisfied, but it's very beautiful.
p95
aVIt's a very great pleasure to fly around.
p96
aVAnd so these combine to form
p97
aVa very intense emotional engagement.
p98
aa(lp99
VBut this isn't the really interesting stuff.
p100
aVThe really interesting stuff about virtuality
p101
aVis what you can measure with it.
p102
aVBecause what you can measure in virtuality
p103
aVis everything.
p104
aVEvery single thing that every single person
p105
aVwho's ever played in a game has ever done can be measured.
p106
aVThe biggest games in the world today
p107
aVare measuring more than one billion points of data
p108
aVabout their players, about what everybody does \u2014
p109
aVfar more detail than you'd ever get from any website.
p110
aVAnd this allows something very special
p111
aVto happen in games.
p112
aVIt's something called the reward schedule.
p113
aVAnd by this, I mean looking
p114
aVat what millions upon millions of people have done
p115
aVand carefully calibrating the rate,
p116
aVthe nature, the type, the intensity of rewards in games
p117
aVto keep them engaged
p118
aVover staggering amounts of time and effort.
p119
aVNow, to try and explain this
p120
aVin sort of real terms,
p121
aVI want to talk about a kind of task
p122
aVthat might fall to you in so many games.
p123
aVGo and get a certain amount of a certain little game-y item.
p124
aVLet's say, for the sake of argument,
p125
aVmy mission is to get 15 pies
p126
aVand I can get 15 pies
p127
aVby killing these cute, little monsters.
p128
aVSimple game quest.
p129
aVNow you can think about this, if you like,
p130
aVas a problem about boxes.
p131
aVI've got to keep opening boxes.
p132
aVI don't know what's inside them until I open them.
p133
aVAnd I go around opening box after box until I've got 15 pies.
p134
aVNow, if you take a game like Warcraft,
p135
aVyou can think about it, if you like,
p136
aVas a great box-opening effort.
p137
aVThe game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes,
p138
aVgetting better and better stuff in them.
p139
aa(lp140
VThis sounds immensely boring
p141
aVbut games are able
p142
aVto make this process
p143
aVincredibly compelling.
p144
aVAnd the way they do this
p145
aVis through a combination of probability and data.
p146
aVLet's think about probability.
p147
aVIf we want to engage someone
p148
aVin the process of opening boxes to try and find pies,
p149
aVwe want to make sure it's neither too easy,
p150
aVnor too difficult, to find a pie.
p151
aVSo what do you do? Well, you look at a million people \u2014
p152
aVno, 100 million people, 100 million box openers \u2014
p153
aVand you work out, if you make the pie rate
p154
aVabout 25 percent \u2014
p155
aVthat's neither too frustrating, nor too easy.
p156
aVIt keeps people engaged.
p157
aVBut of course, that's not all you do \u2014 there's 15 pies.
p158
aVNow, I could make a game called Piecraft,
p159
aVwhere all you had to do was get a million pies
p160
aVor a thousand pies.
p161
aVThat would be very boring.
p162
aVFifteen is a pretty optimal number.
p163
aVYou find that \u2014 you know, between five and 20
p164
aVis about the right number for keeping people going.
p165
aVBut we don't just have pies in the boxes.
p166
aVThere's 100 percent up here.
p167
aVAnd what we do is make sure that every time a box is opened,
p168
aVthere's something in it, some little reward
p169
aVthat keeps people progressing and engaged.
p170
aVIn most adventure games,
p171
aVit's a little bit in-game currency, a little bit experience.
p172
aVBut we don't just do that either.
p173
aa(lp174
VWe also say there's going to be loads of other items
p175
aVof varying qualities and levels of excitement.
p176
aVThere's going to be a 10 percent chance you get a pretty good item.
p177
aVThere's going to be a 0.1 percent chance
p178
aVyou get an absolutely awesome item.
p179
aVAnd each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item.
p180
aVAnd also, we say,
p181
aV"Well, how many monsters? Should I have the entire world full of a billion monsters?"
p182
aVNo, we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time.
p183
aVSo I'm drawn on. It's not too easy, not too difficult.
p184
aVSo all this is very powerful.
p185
aVBut we're in virtuality. These aren't real boxes.
p186
aVSo we can do
p187
aVsome rather amazing things.
p188
aVWe notice, looking at all these people opening boxes,
p189
aVthat when people get to about 13 out of 15 pies,
p190
aVtheir perception shifts, they start to get a bit bored, a bit testy.
p191
aVThey're not rational about probability.
p192
aVThey think this game is unfair.
p193
aVIt's not giving me my last two pies. I'm going to give up.
p194
aVIf they're real boxes, there's not much we can do,
p195
aVbut in a game we can just say, "Right, well.
p196
aVWhen you get to 13 pies, you've got 75 percent chance of getting a pie now."
p197
aVKeep you engaged. Look at what people do \u2014
p198
aVadjust the world to match their expectation.
p199
aVOur games don't always do this.
p200
aVAnd one thing they certainly do at the moment
p201
aVis if you got a 0.1 percent awesome item,
p202
aVthey make very sure another one doesn't appear for a certain length of time
p203
aVto keep the value, to keep it special.
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd the point is really
p206
aVthat we evolved to be satisfied by the world
p207
aVin particular ways.
p208
aVOver tens and hundreds of thousands of years,
p209
aVwe evolved to find certain things stimulating,
p210
aVand as very intelligent, civilized beings,
p211
aVwe're enormously stimulated by problem solving and learning.
p212
aVBut now, we can reverse engineer that
p213
aVand build worlds
p214
aVthat expressly tick our evolutionary boxes.
p215
aVSo what does all this mean in practice?
p216
aVWell, I've come up
p217
aVwith seven things
p218
aVthat, I think, show
p219
aVhow you can take these lessons from games
p220
aVand use them outside of games.
p221
aVThe first one is very simple:
p222
aVexperience bars measuring progress \u2014
p223
aVsomething that's been talked about brilliantly
p224
aVby people like Jesse Schell earlier this year.
p225
aVIt's already been done at the University of Indiana in the States, among other places.
p226
aVIt's the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementally
p227
aVin little bits and pieces,
p228
aVyou give them one profile character avatar
p229
aVwhich is constantly progressing
p230
aVin tiny, tiny, tiny little increments which they feel are their own.
p231
aVAnd everything comes towards that,
p232
aVand they watch it creeping up, and they own that as it goes along.
p233
aa(lp234
VSecond, multiple long and short-term aims \u2014
p235
aV5,000 pies, boring,
p236
aV15 pies, interesting.
p237
aVSo, you give people
p238
aVlots and lots of different tasks.
p239
aVYou say, it's about
p240
aVdoing 10 of these questions,
p241
aVbut another task
p242
aVis turning up to 20 classes on time,
p243
aVbut another task is collaborating with other people,
p244
aVanother task is showing you're working five times,
p245
aVanother task is hitting this particular target.
p246
aVYou break things down into these calibrated slices
p247
aVthat people can choose and do in parallel
p248
aVto keep them engaged
p249
aVand that you can use to point them
p250
aVtowards individually beneficial activities.
p251
aa(lp252
VThird, you reward effort.
p253
aVIt's your 100 percent factor. Games are brilliant at this.
p254
aVEvery time you do something, you get credit; you get a credit for trying.
p255
aVYou don't punish failure. You reward every little bit of effort \u2014
p256
aVa little bit of gold, a little bit of credit. You've done 20 questions \u2014 tick.
p257
aVIt all feeds in as minute reinforcement.
p258
aa(lp259
VFourth, feedback.
p260
aVThis is absolutely crucial,
p261
aVand virtuality is dazzling at delivering this.
p262
aVIf you look at some of the most intractable problems in the world today
p263
aVthat we've been hearing amazing things about,
p264
aVit's very, very hard for people to learn
p265
aVif they cannot link consequences to actions.
p266
aVPollution, global warming, these things \u2014
p267
aVthe consequences are distant in time and space.
p268
aVIt's very hard to learn, to feel a lesson.
p269
aVBut if you can model things for people,
p270
aVif you can give things to people that they can manipulate
p271
aVand play with and where the feedback comes,
p272
aVthen they can learn a lesson, they can see,
p273
aVthey can move on, they can understand.
p274
aa(lp275
VAnd fifth,
p276
aVthe element of uncertainty.
p277
aVNow this is the neurological goldmine,
p278
aVif you like,
p279
aVbecause a known reward
p280
aVexcites people,
p281
aVbut what really gets them going
p282
aVis the uncertain reward,
p283
aVthe reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty,
p284
aVthat they didn't quite know whether they were going to get it or not.
p285
aVThe 25 percent. This lights the brain up.
p286
aVAnd if you think about
p287
aVusing this in testing,
p288
aVin just introducing control elements of randomness
p289
aVin all forms of testing and training,
p290
aVyou can transform the levels of people's engagement
p291
aVby tapping into this very powerful
p292
aVevolutionary mechanism.
p293
aVWhen we don't quite predict something perfectly,
p294
aVwe get really excited about it.
p295
aVWe just want to go back and find out more.
p296
aa(lp297
VAs you probably know, the neurotransmitter
p298
aVassociated with learning is called dopamine.
p299
aVIt's associated with reward-seeking behavior.
p300
aVAnd something very exciting is just beginning to happen
p301
aVin places like the University of Bristol in the U.K.,
p302
aVwhere we are beginning to be able to model mathematically
p303
aVdopamine levels in the brain.
p304
aVAnd what this means is we can predict learning,
p305
aVwe can predict enhanced engagement,
p306
aVthese windows, these windows of time,
p307
aVin which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level.
p308
aVAnd two things really flow from this.
p309
aVThe first has to do with memory,
p310
aVthat we can find these moments.
p311
aVWhen someone is more likely to remember,
p312
aVwe can give them a nugget in a window.
p313
aVAnd the second thing is confidence,
p314
aVthat we can see how game-playing and reward structures
p315
aVmake people braver, make them more willing to take risks,
p316
aVmore willing to take on difficulty,
p317
aVharder to discourage.
p318
aVThis can all seem very sinister.
p319
aVBut you know, sort of "our brains have been manipulated; we're all addicts."
p320
aVThe word "addiction" is thrown around.
p321
aVThere are real concerns there.
p322
aVBut the biggest neurological turn-on for people
p323
aVis other people.
p324
aVThis is what really excites us.
p325
aVIn reward terms, it's not money;
p326
aVit's not being given cash \u2014 that's nice \u2014
p327
aVit's doing stuff with our peers,
p328
aVwatching us, collaborating with us.
p329
aa(lp330
VAnd I want to tell you a quick story about 1999 \u2014
p331
aVa video game called EverQuest.
p332
aVAnd in this video game,
p333
aVthere were two really big dragons, and you had to team up to kill them \u2014
p334
aV42 people, up to 42 to kill these big dragons.
p335
aVThat's a problem
p336
aVbecause they dropped two or three decent items.
p337
aVSo players addressed this problem
p338
aVby spontaneously coming up with a system
p339
aVto motivate each other,
p340
aVfairly and transparently.
p341
aVWhat happened was, they paid each other a virtual currency
p342
aVthey called "dragon kill points."
p343
aVAnd every time you turned up to go on a mission,
p344
aVyou got paid in dragon kill points.
p345
aVThey tracked these on a separate website.
p346
aVSo they tracked their own private currency,
p347
aVand then players could bid afterwards
p348
aVfor cool items they wanted \u2014
p349
aVall organized by the players themselves.
p350
aVNow the staggering system, not just that this worked in EverQuest,
p351
aVbut that today, a decade on,
p352
aVevery single video game in the world with this kind of task
p353
aVuses a version of this system \u2014
p354
aVtens of millions of people.
p355
aVAnd the success rate
p356
aVis at close to 100 percent.
p357
aVThis is a player-developed,
p358
aVself-enforcing, voluntary currency,
p359
aVand it's incredibly sophisticated
p360
aVplayer behavior.
p361
aa(lp362
VAnd I just want to end by suggesting
p363
aVa few ways in which these principles
p364
aVcould fan out into the world.
p365
aVLet's start with business.
p366
aVI mean, we're beginning to see some of the big problems
p367
aVaround something like business are
p368
aVrecycling and energy conservation.
p369
aVWe're beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologies
p370
aVlike real-time energy meters.
p371
aVAnd I just look at this, and I think, yes,
p372
aVwe could take that so much further
p373
aVby allowing people to set targets
p374
aVby setting calibrated targets,
p375
aVby using elements of uncertainty,
p376
aVby using these multiple targets,
p377
aVby using a grand, underlying reward and incentive system,
p378
aVby setting people up
p379
aVto collaborate in terms of groups, in terms of streets
p380
aVto collaborate and compete,
p381
aVto use these very sophisticated
p382
aVgroup and motivational mechanics we see.
p383
aVIn terms of education,
p384
aVperhaps most obviously of all,
p385
aVwe can transform how we engage people.
p386
aVWe can offer people the grand continuity
p387
aVof experience and personal investment.
p388
aVWe can break things down
p389
aVinto highly calibrated small tasks.
p390
aVWe can use calculated randomness.
p391
aVWe can reward effort consistently
p392
aVas everything fields together.
p393
aVAnd we can use the kind of group behaviors
p394
aVthat we see evolving when people are at play together,
p395
aVthese really quite unprecedentedly complex
p396
aVcooperative mechanisms.
p397
aVGovernment, well, one thing that comes to mind
p398
aVis the U.S. government, among others,
p399
aVis literally starting to pay people
p400
aVto lose weight.
p401
aVSo we're seeing financial reward being used
p402
aVto tackle the great issue of obesity.
p403
aVBut again, those rewards
p404
aVcould be calibrated so precisely
p405
aVif we were able to use the vast expertise
p406
aVof gaming systems to just jack up that appeal,
p407
aVto take the data, to take the observations,
p408
aVof millions of human hours
p409
aVand plow that feedback
p410
aVinto increasing engagement.
p411
aa(lp412
VAnd in the end, it's this word, "engagement,"
p413
aVthat I want to leave you with.
p414
aVIt's about how individual engagement
p415
aVcan be transformed
p416
aVby the psychological and the neurological lessons
p417
aVwe can learn from watching people that are playing games.
p418
aVBut it's also about collective engagement
p419
aVand about the unprecedented laboratory
p420
aVfor observing what makes people tick
p421
aVand work and play and engage
p422
aVon a grand scale in games.
p423
aVAnd if we can look at these things and learn from them
p424
aVand see how to turn them outwards,
p425
aVthen I really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands.
p426
