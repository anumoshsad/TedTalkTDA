VI am going to be talking about secrets.
p4
aVObviously the best way to divulge a secret
p5
aVis to tell someone to not say anything about it.
p6
aV(Laughter)
p7
aVSecrets. I'm using PowerPoint this year
p8
aVjust because, you know, I'm into the TED thing.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aVAnd when you use these things you don't have to go like that.
p11
aVYou just press it.
p12
aV(Laughter)
p13
aVOh, man. Um, yes.
p14
aV(Laughter)
p15
aVYes. I'm sure! Just change it!
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aVIs Bill Gates here?
p18
aVChange it! Come on! What?
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aVAh! Okay.
p21
aVThat's not my slides, but it's okay.
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VAs you can see, these are all maps.
p25
aVAnd maps are important devices for transferring information,
p26
aVespecially if you have human cognitive ability.
p27
aVWe can see that all formulas are really maps.
p28
aVNow, as humans, we make maps of places
p29
aVthat we seldom even go,
p30
aVwhich seems a little wasteful of time.
p31
aa(lp32
VThis, of course, is a map of the moon.
p33
aVThere're some very delightful names.
p34
aVTranquilacalitis, [unclear]. My favorite is Frigoris.
p35
aVWhat are these people thinking? Frigoris?
p36
aVWhat the Frigoris you doing? Names are important.
p37
aVFrigoris? This is the Moon. People could live there one day.
p38
aVI'll meet you at Frigoris. No. I don't think so.
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VThere we see Mars, again with various names.
p42
aVAnd this is all done, by the way,
p43
aVby the International Astronomical Union.
p44
aVThis is an actual group of people
p45
aVthat sit around naming planetary objects.
p46
aVThis is from their actual book.
p47
aVThese are some of the names that they have chosen, ladies and gentlemen.
p48
aa(lp49
VI'll go through a little of them. Bolotnitsa.
p50
aVThat, of course, is the Slavic swamp mermaid.
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aVNow I think the whole concept of a mermaid
p53
aVdoesn't really blend into the swamp feel.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aV"Oh look! Mermaid come out of swamp. Oh boy!
p56
aVIt's time for Bolotnitsa!"
p57
aV(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VDjabran Fluctus.
p60
aVIf that don't flow off the tongue, what does?
p61
aV(Laughter)
p62
aVI mean kids are studying this stuff
p63
aVand they've got the word "fluctus" up there. That's wrong.
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aVOne dyslexic kid and he could be ruining his life.
p66
aV(Laughter)
p67
aV"It fluctus up, Mama."
p68
aa(lp69
VHikuleo Fluctus.
p70
aVThat's a little more flowing. Hikuleo
p71
aVsounds like a kind of a Leonardo DiCaprio
p72
aV17 syllable thing.
p73
aVAnd that's the Tonga underworld.
p74
aa(lp75
VAnd one of my favorites is the Itoki Fluctus,
p76
aVwho is the Nicaraguan goddess of insects, stars, and planets.
p77
aVNow, if you're a goddess of stars and planets
p78
aVwouldn't you relegate insects to somebody else?
p79
aV(Laughter)
p80
aV"No, no, really, I'm so busy with the stars.
p81
aVWould you mind taking the insects? Thank you darling.
p82
aVOh take the spiders too. I know they're not insects, but I don't care.
p83
aVMonkeys, chimps, just get rid of the hairy creatures."
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VNow, we're going to be going to Mars one day. And when we do,
p87
aVit's going to be unfair for the people that are living there
p88
aVto have to live with these ridiculous names.
p89
aVSo, you'll be on Mars, and you're at
p90
aVHellespointica Depressio
p91
aVwhich has got to be a really "up" place.
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VYeah, I'm at the Depressio, and I want to get over to Amazonis
p95
aVso I plug it into the Mars map,
p96
aVand click the button and there's my directions.
p97
aVI go to Chrysokeras.
p98
aV(Laughter) Left to the Thymiamata.
p99
aVThen to Niliacus Lacus,
p100
aVwhich is not a bad name.
p101
aVNiliacus Lacus, try to get the practice, slick-a-tick-a-bacus.
p102
aVThat's a cool name. I will say that.
p103
aVSo, I hold back a little of my venom
p104
aVfor these astronomical misnomers.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd then of course Arnon to Thoth.
p107
aVAnd of course there will be advertisements.
p108
aVThis is from their rule book, the International Astronomical Union.
p109
aVAnd you know they're international because
p110
aVthey put it "en Francais" as well.
p111
aVL'Union Astronomique Internationale,
p112
aVfor those of you who don't speak French.
p113
aVI thought I'd translate for you.
p114
aa(lp115
VFrom the rulebook: Nomenclature is a tool.
p116
aVThe first consideration, make it clear, simple and unambiguous.
p117
aVAnd I think that Djabran Fluctus,
p118
aVthat fits that mode.
p119
aV(Laughter)
p120
aVThat's simple, the goddess of goats, very simple.
p121
aVDjabran Fluctus.
p122
aV"Now, Frank is this clear to you, Djabran Fluctus?"
p123
aV"Yeah, that's the goat goddess right? The Abacazanian?
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aVIt's clear to me."
p126
aV"Listen, I'm going back to the swamp mermaid. Can you call me in a little while?"
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VAlso, from the actual document
p130
aVI highlighted a part I thought may be of interest.
p131
aVAnyone can suggest changing a name.
p132
aVSo, I look to you, fellow member of the Earth community.
p133
aVWe've got to change this stuff up fast.
p134
aVSo, these are actual names of people that work there.
p135
aVI did some more investigation.
p136
aVThese are more people working for this group.
p137
aVAnd, as you can see, they don't use their first names.
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aVThese are people naming planets, and they won't use their first names.
p140
aVSomething is askew here.
p141
aV(Laughter)
p142
aVIs it because his name is really Jupiter Blunck?
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aVIs that Ganymede Andromeda Burba?
p145
aV(Laughter)
p146
aVIs that Mars Ya Marov?
p147
aVI don't know. But it's investigative material, no doubt.
p148
aa(lp149
VThere are some mapping people who do use their names.
p150
aVWitness please, Eugene Shoemaker,
p151
aVwho, diligently, from a young boy
p152
aVdecided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies.
p153
aVMust have been a very interesting day in the Shoemaker house.
p154
aV"Mom, I want to make maps."
p155
aV"That's wonderful Eugene. You could make maps of Toronto."
p156
aV"No, I want to make maps of planets."
p157
aV"Yeah, go to your room."
p158
aV(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VMartians, Venusians, Jovians.
p161
aVWe have names for places where people don't exist.
p162
aVThat seems a little silly to me.
p163
aVThere are no Jovians.
p164
aa(lp165
VGetting back to my premise, I used stamps, by the way,
p166
aVbecause you don't have to pay anybody for the rights.
p167
aV(Laughter)
p168
aV(Applause)
p169
aVThere is obviously Einstein, Niels Bohr,
p170
aVde Fermat's last theorem, and I'm not sure whether that's James Coburn
p171
aVor Richard Harris.
p172
aV(Laughter)
p173
aVIt's definitely one of the two. I'm not really clear which one.
p174
aa(lp175
VBut obviously the point is that numbers are maps.
p176
aVAnd within numbers, is there an underlying secret to the universe?
p177
aVThat is the premise of this particular presentation.
p178
aVBy the way, that's a natural picture of Saturn,
p179
aVno adjustments. I mean that's just beautiful.
p180
aVSo beautiful that I will even give up a laugh
p181
aVto explain my love of this particular planet,
p182
aVand the day Saturday, named after it, wonderfully.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo, formulas relate number to form.
p185
aVThat's Euler, his formula
p186
aVwas one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory
p187
aVwhich is kind of cool, not that funny, but it is cool.
p188
aV(Laughter)
p189
aVHe was also famous for having no body.
p190
aV(Laughter)
p191
aVWhich a lot of you are like, "How did he figure that out?"
p192
aVHe's got no body, no man, just a head floating high.
p193
aVHere comes Euler.
p194
aV(Laughter)
p195
aa(lp196
VAnd that's an icosahedron,
p197
aVwhich is one of the five sacred solids, very important shapes.
p198
aVYou see the icosahedron again.
p199
aVThe dodecahedron, it's dual.
p200
aVThere is a dodecahedron which I had to do in my room last night.
p201
aVThe five sacred solids, as you can see there.
p202
aVWhich is not to be confused with the five sacred salads.
p203
aV(Laughter)
p204
aVBlue cheese, ranch, oil and vinegar, thousand islands and house.
p205
aVI suggest the house.
p206
aa(lp207
VThe reality, now here is something important.
p208
aVWhat's important about this is
p209
aVthese shapes are duals of each other.
p210
aVAnd you can see how the icosahedron
p211
aVwithdraws into the dodecahedron
p212
aVand then they just merge into each other.
p213
aVSo, the whole concept of branes in the universe,
p214
aVif the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron
p215
aVthis is a very good map of what could possibly be.
p216
aVAnd that is, of course, what we are here to talk about.
p217
aa(lp218
VWhat a coincidence!
p219
aVOctober 9th, in France, Jean-Pierre Luminet
p220
aVsaid that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron,
p221
aVbased on information that they got from this probe.
p222
aVThis would be a normal wave pattern.
p223
aVBut what they're seeing, way out there in the far reaches
p224
aVof the microwave background,
p225
aVis this kind of odd undulation.
p226
aVIt doesn't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be.
p227
aa(lp228
VSo, you can kind of get an idea from this
p229
aVextrapolating that back under this huge picture,
p230
aVso we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like.
p231
aVAnd judging from this, it looks a little like a cheeseburger.
p232
aV(Laughter)
p233
aVSo, I'm thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger.
p234
aVAnd for me, that's a win-win.
p235
aVEverybody goes, I'm happy.
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aVBetter really hurry up.
p238
aa(lp239
VI just threw this in because
p240
aVas important as all of our intellectual abilities are,
p241
aVwithout heart and without love it's just \u2014 it's all meaningless.
p242
aVAnd that, to me, is really beautiful.
p243
aV(Laughter)
p244
aVExcept for that creepy guy in the background.
p245
aV(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
VGetting back to the point of my particular presentation,
p248
aVKepler, one of my great heroes,
p249
aVwho realized that these five solids, which I spoke of earlier,
p250
aVwere related somehow to the planets,
p251
aVbut he couldn't prove it. It freaked him out.
p252
aVBut it did lead to Newton discovering gravity.
p253
aVSo, maps of things leading to organized understandings
p254
aVof the universe in which we emerge.
p255
aa(lp256
VNow this is Isaac from a Vietnamese stamp.
p257
aV(Laughter)
p258
aVI am not suggesting at all that my Vietnamese brothers and sisters
p259
aVcould maybe use a little art class here and there. But ...
p260
aV(Laughter)
p261
aVthat's not a good picture.
p262
aV(Laughter)
p263
aVNot a good picture. Now, my friends in the island of Nevis
p264
aVare a little better. Look at that! That's Isaac Newton.
p265
aVThat guy is rockin'.
p266
aV(Laughter)
p267
aVWhat a handsome cat.
p268
aa(lp269
VOnce again, Nicaragua let me down.
p270
aV(Laughter)
p271
aVAnd Copernicus looks like Johnny Carson, which is really weird.
p272
aV(Laughter)
p273
aVI don't get that at all.
p274
aVOnce again, these guys rock it out.
p275
aVIsaac is kickin' ass. Man, he looks like a rock star.
p276
aVThis is freaky is a major way.
p277
aVThis is Sierra Leone.
p278
aVThey got little babies in there, floating in there.
p279
aV(Laughter)
p280
aa(lp281
VMan. I don't really need to comment on this.
p282
aVBut I didn't know that Isaac Newton was in the Moody Blues. Did you?
p283
aV(Laughter)
p284
aVWhen did this happen?
p285
aV(Laughter)
p286
aVIt's a different kind of course. And they've got five apples?
p287
aVI mean these guys are extrapolating in realms
p288
aVthat are not necessarily valid.
p289
aVAlthough five is a good number, of course.
p290
aa(lp291
VEcuador, my friend Kepler,
p292
aVas you can see, they call him Juan.
p293
aV(Laughter)
p294
aVJuan? No! Johannes, not Juan.
p295
aVIt wasn't Carlos Chaplain. It's wrong.
p296
aV(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VRené Descartes, of course. Once again
p299
aVthese Grenada people, this is like way too sick
p300
aVfor anybody's imagination.
p301
aVHe's all murky. There is little kids leaning on his leg,
p302
aVlittle ghosts flying around. We gotta clean this stuff up
p303
aVfast, ladies and gentlemen.
p304
aV(Laughter)
p305
aa(lp306
VThis is, of course, the Cartesian coordinates.
p307
aVOnce again, that's Sierra Leone.
p308
aVThis is again, indicating how numbers
p309
aVrelate to space relate to form, maps of the universe.
p310
aVBecause that's why we're here, really, I think to figure stuff out and to love each other.
p311
aa(lp312
VDescartes. (Laughter)
p313
aVBefore the horse. (Laughter)
p314
aVNow, Monaco took Descartes, and just flipped him around.
p315
aVNow, Monaco is problematic for me, and I'll show you why.
p316
aVHere is a map. All they have is a casino on it.
p317
aV(Laughter)
p318
aVAnd why Franklin Delano Roosevelt is on their map
p319
aVI don't even want to hazard a guess.
p320
aVBut I'd say he'd been to Hellespointica Depressio recently.
p321
aV(Laughter)
p322
aa(lp323
VThis is the flag of Monaco. Ladies and gentlemen,
p324
aVthe flag of Indonesia. Please examine.
p325
aV(Laughter)
p326
aV(Applause)
p327
aVNot sure how this came to be, but it's not right.
p328
aVIn Monaco, "No, what are you talking about?
p329
aVThey are so different.
p330
aVLook, ours is more red, it's longer.
p331
aVThey stole our flag! They stole our flag!"
p332
aV(Laughter)
p333
aa(lp334
VBode's law wasn't even his law. It was a guy named Titus.
p335
aVAnd the reason I just bring this up because it is a law that doesn't really work.
p336
aVThat's Jude Law and some of his films recently didn't work.
p337
aV(Laughter)
p338
aVJust a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted.
p339
aa(lp340
VAnd I wonder if the photographer said, "Okay, Jude,
p341
aVcould you touch your tooth? That's good."
p342
aVJust a tip, if you're being photographed
p343
aVfor press pictures, don't touch your teeth.
p344
aV(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
VPrime numbers, Gauss, one of my favorites.
p347
aVGolden section, I've been obsessed with this thing
p348
aVsince before I was born.
p349
aVI know that scares a lot of you,
p350
aVbut that was my purpose entirely.
p351
aVThere we can see Fibonacci numbers related to the Golden Section,
p352
aVbecause Fibonacci and Golden Section
p353
aVrelate to the unfolding of the measured meter of matter, as I refer to it.
p354
aVIf Fibonacci had been on Paxil,
p355
aV(Laughter)
p356
aVthat would be the Fibonacci series.
p357
aV"Ten milligram, 20 milligram."
p358
aV"Leonardo, dinner's ready, put down those books and take your pills."
p359
aV"Yes, Mama."
p360
aV(Laughter)
p361
aa(lp362
VAlright where is this going? That's a good question.
p363
aVHere is the premise that I began 27 years ago.
p364
aVIf numbers can express
p365
aVthe laws of this incredible universe that we live,
p366
aVI reason, through some sort of reverse engineering,
p367
aVwe could extrapolate from them
p368
aVsome basic structural element of this universe.
p369
aVAnd that's what I did. Twenty-seven years ago
p370
aVI started working on this.
p371
aa(lp372
VAnd I tried to build a particle accelerator.
p373
aV(Laughter)
p374
aVAnd that didn't work out well.
p375
aVSo, then I thought a calculator is a metaphor.
p376
aVI can just divide numbers, that's like atom smashing.
p377
aVThat's what I did. That's how I found Moleeds.
p378
aVMoleeds are what I believe
p379
aVthe thing that will allow string theory to be proved.
p380
aVThey are the nodes on the string,
p381
aVpatterns and relationships, 27, 37.
p382
aVThat was the first chart I came up with.
p383
aa(lp384
VYou can see, even if you don't go for the numbers,
p385
aVthe beauty of the symmetry.
p386
aVThe numbers from one to 36, divided into six groups.
p387
aVSymmetry, pairs.
p388
aVEvery top adds up to 37.
p389
aVBottom, all 74.
p390
aVThere is so many intricate relationships that I'm not going to go there now,
p391
aVbecause you would say, "Hey, go back to the Fluctus part."
p392
aV(Laughter)
p393
aa(lp394
VCircle of Fifths, acoustic harmony, geometric symmetry.
p395
aVI knew those two were related.
p396
aVOnce again, the Cartesian kind of cross-over.
p397
aVSo, I said if I'm going to put a circle,
p398
aVsee what kind of patterns I get, boom, the Red System.
p399
aVLook at that. You can't just make this stuff up, ladies and gentlemen.
p400
aV(Laughter)
p401
aVYou can't just go around going, "Oh, I'm going to put some triangles in a circle
p402
aVand they're going to be symmetrical. And they're all going to add up,
p403
aVand it's going to be, oh yeah, I figured that out."
p404
aa(lp405
VThis is beyond anything anybody could just make up.
p406
aVThere is the Orange System.
p407
aV(Laughter)
p408
aVAnd you'll see over here, these are multiples of the number 27.
p409
aVAnd they recapitulate that shape,
p410
aVeven though that's a circle of nine and that's a circle of 36. It's nuts.
p411
aV(Laughter)
p412
aVThat's the Green System. It all folds in half
p413
aVon the Green System, right between 18 and 19.
p414
aVThe Blue System. The Violet. It's all there.
p415
aV(Laughter)
p416
aVLook at that! I mean you cannot make that stuff up.
p417
aV(Laughter)
p418
aVThat just doesn't fall out of a tree, ladies and gentlemen.
p419
aVTwenty-seven years of my life!
p420
aV(Laughter)
p421
aVAnd I'm presenting it here at TED. Why?
p422
aVBecause this is the place if aliens land, I hope they come here.
p423
aV(Laughter)
p424
aV"We are going to destroy the Earth. Hmmm ... maybe not."
p425
aV(Laughter)
p426
aa(lp427
VIn this last year I have found these subsequent systems
p428
aVwhich allow for the mathematic possibilities
p429
aVof the Calabi-Yau manifolds
p430
aVin a way that doesn't necessitate these little hidden dimensions.
p431
aVWhich works mathematically, but it just doesn't seem God-like to me.
p432
aVIt just seems like it's not sexy and elegant, it's hidden.
p433
aVI don't want hidden, I want to see it.
p434
aV(Laughter)
p435
aa(lp436
VI found other pairs all have symmetry,
p437
aVeven though, unlike the master one, their symmetry is split.
p438
aVUnbelievable. This is like crazy.
p439
aVAm I the only one that sees this?
p440
aV(Laughter)
p441
aVYou know, I didn't just draw this in a day, by the way.
p442
aVYou know, try making some charts like this at home.
p443
aVYou gotta be accurate! There's measurement involved, increments.
p444
aVThese are maps, by the way.
p445
aVNot stamps, but one day.
p446
aV(Laughter)
p447
aa(lp448
VOkay, I'm getting to the punch. Golden Ratio, it's crazy.
p449
aVAnd look at this, built within it is the Golden Ratio.
p450
aVI start looking at that, and look at them again.
p451
aVThey start looking like planets.
p452
aVI go to JPL.
p453
aVI look at the orbits of the planets.
p454
