VLadies and gentlemen, gather around.
p4
aVI would love to share with you a story.
p5
aa(lp6
VOnce upon a time
p7
aVin 19th century Germany,
p8
aVthere was the book.
p9
aVNow during this time,
p10
aVthe book was the king of storytelling.
p11
aVIt was venerable.
p12
aVIt was ubiquitous.
p13
aVBut it was a little bit boring.
p14
aVBecause in its 400 years of existence,
p15
aVstorytellers never evolved the book
p16
aVas a storytelling device.
p17
aVBut then one author arrived,
p18
aVand he changed the game forever.
p19
aV(Music)
p20
aVHis name was Lothar,
p21
aVLothar Meggendorfer.
p22
aVLothar Meggendorfer put his foot down,
p23
aVand he said, "Genug ist genug!"
p24
aVHe grabbed his pen,
p25
aVhe snatched his scissors.
p26
aVThis man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy
p27
aVand just decided to fold.
p28
aVHistory would know Lothar Meggendorfer
p29
aVas \u2014 who else? \u2014
p30
aVthe world's first true inventor
p31
aVof the children's pop-up book.
p32
aV(Music)
p33
aVFor this delight and for this wonder,
p34
aVpeople rejoiced.
p35
aV(Cheering)
p36
aVThey were happy because the story survived,
p37
aVand that the world would keep on spinning.
p38
aa(lp39
VLothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first
p40
aVto evolve the way a story was told,
p41
aVand he certainly wasn't the last.
p42
aVWhether storytellers realized it or not,
p43
aVthey were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit
p44
aVwhen they moved opera to vaudville,
p45
aVradio news to radio theater,
p46
aVfilm to film in motion
p47
aVto film in sound, color, 3D,
p48
aVon VHS and on DVD.
p49
aVThere seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around.
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aVBecause, not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world,
p54
aVbut they could do so
p55
aVusing what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices.
p56
aVFor example, one company
p57
aVwould tell a story of love
p58
aVthrough its very own search engine.
p59
aVOne Taiwanese production studio
p60
aVwould interpret American politics in 3D.
p61
aV(Laughter)
p62
aVAnd one man would tell the stories of his father
p63
aVby using a platform called Twitter
p64
aVto communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd after all this, everyone paused;
p67
aVthey took a step back.
p68
aVThey realized that, in 6,000 years of storytelling,
p69
aVthey've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls
p70
aVto depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls.
p71
aVAnd this was a cause for celebration.
p72
aVThe art of storytelling has remained unchanged.
p73
aVAnd for the most part, the stories are recycled.
p74
aVBut the way that humans tell the stories
p75
aVhas always evolved
p76
aVwith pure, consistent novelty.
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd they remembered a man,
p79
aVone amazing German,
p80
aVevery time a new storytelling device
p81
aVpopped up next.
p82
aVAnd for that,
p83
aVthe audience \u2014
p84
aVthe lovely, beautiful audience \u2014
p85
aVwould live happily ever after.
