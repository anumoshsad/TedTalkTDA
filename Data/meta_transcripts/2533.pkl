VSo, I lead a team at Google that works on machine intelligence;
p4
aVin other words, the engineering discipline of making computers and devices
p5
aVable to do some of the things that brains do.
p6
aVAnd this makes us interested in real brains
p7
aVand neuroscience as well,
p8
aVand especially interested in the things that our brains do
p9
aVthat are still far superior to the performance of computers.
p10
aa(lp11
VHistorically, one of those areas has been perception,
p12
aVthe process by which things out there in the world \u2014
p13
aVsounds and images \u2014
p14
aVcan turn into concepts in the mind.
p15
aVThis is essential for our own brains,
p16
aVand it's also pretty useful on a computer.
p17
aVThe machine perception algorithms, for example, that our team makes,
p18
aVare what enable your pictures on Google Photos to become searchable,
p19
aVbased on what's in them.
p20
aVThe flip side of perception is creativity:
p21
aVturning a concept into something out there into the world.
p22
aVSo over the past year, our work on machine perception
p23
aVhas also unexpectedly connected with the world of machine creativity
p24
aVand machine art.
p25
aa(lp26
VI think Michelangelo had a penetrating insight
p27
aVinto to this dual relationship between perception and creativity.
p28
aVThis is a famous quote of his:
p29
aV"Every block of stone has a statue inside of it,
p30
aVand the job of the sculptor is to discover it."
p31
aVSo I think that what Michelangelo was getting at
p32
aVis that we create by perceiving,
p33
aVand that perception itself is an act of imagination
p34
aVand is the stuff of creativity.
p35
aa(lp36
VThe organ that does all the thinking and perceiving and imagining,
p37
aVof course, is the brain.
p38
aVAnd I'd like to begin with a brief bit of history
p39
aVabout what we know about brains.
p40
aVBecause unlike, say, the heart or the intestines,
p41
aVyou really can't say very much about a brain by just looking at it,
p42
aVat least with the naked eye.
p43
aVThe early anatomists who looked at brains
p44
aVgave the superficial structures of this thing all kinds of fanciful names,
p45
aVlike hippocampus, meaning "little shrimp."
p46
aVBut of course that sort of thing doesn't tell us very much
p47
aVabout what's actually going on inside.
p48
aa(lp49
VThe first person who, I think, really developed some kind of insight
p50
aVinto what was going on in the brain
p51
aVwas the great Spanish neuroanatomist, Santiago Ramón y Cajal,
p52
aVin the 19th century,
p53
aVwho used microscopy and special stains
p54
aVthat could selectively fill in or render in very high contrast
p55
aVthe individual cells in the brain,
p56
aVin order to start to understand their morphologies.
p57
aVAnd these are the kinds of drawings that he made of neurons
p58
aVin the 19th century.
p59
aa(lp60
VThis is from a bird brain.
p61
aVAnd you see this incredible variety of different sorts of cells,
p62
aVeven the cellular theory itself was quite new at this point.
p63
aVAnd these structures,
p64
aVthese cells that have these arborizations,
p65
aVthese branches that can go very, very long distances \u2014
p66
aVthis was very novel at the time.
p67
aVThey're reminiscent, of course, of wires.
p68
aVThat might have been obvious to some people in the 19th century;
p69
aVthe revolutions of wiring and electricity were just getting underway.
p70
aVBut in many ways,
p71
aVthese microanatomical drawings of Ramón y Cajal's, like this one,
p72
aVthey're still in some ways unsurpassed.
p73
aa(lp74
VWe're still more than a century later,
p75
aVtrying to finish the job that Ramón y Cajal started.
p76
aVThese are raw data from our collaborators
p77
aVat the Max Planck Institute of Neuroscience.
p78
aVAnd what our collaborators have done
p79
aVis to image little pieces of brain tissue.
p80
aVThe entire sample here is about one cubic millimeter in size,
p81
aVand I'm showing you a very, very small piece of it here.
p82
aVThat bar on the left is about one micron.
p83
aVThe structures you see are mitochondria
p84
aVthat are the size of bacteria.
p85
aVAnd these are consecutive slices
p86
aVthrough this very, very tiny block of tissue.
p87
aVJust for comparison's sake,
p88
aVthe diameter of an average strand of hair is about 100 microns.
p89
aVSo we're looking at something much, much smaller
p90
aVthan a single strand of hair.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd from these kinds of serial electron microscopy slices,
p93
aVone can start to make reconstructions in 3D of neurons that look like these.
p94
aVSo these are sort of in the same style as Ramón y Cajal.
p95
aVOnly a few neurons lit up,
p96
aVbecause otherwise we wouldn't be able to see anything here.
p97
aVIt would be so crowded,
p98
aVso full of structure,
p99
aVof wiring all connecting one neuron to another.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo Ramón y Cajal was a little bit ahead of his time,
p102
aVand progress on understanding the brain
p103
aVproceeded slowly over the next few decades.
p104
aVBut we knew that neurons used electricity,
p105
aVand by World War II, our technology was advanced enough
p106
aVto start doing real electrical experiments on live neurons
p107
aVto better understand how they worked.
p108
aVThis was the very same time when computers were being invented,
p109
aVvery much based on the idea of modeling the brain \u2014
p110
aVof "intelligent machinery," as Alan Turing called it,
p111
aVone of the fathers of computer science.
p112
aa(lp113
VWarren McCulloch and Walter Pitts looked at Ramón y Cajal's drawing
p114
aVof visual cortex,
p115
aVwhich I'm showing here.
p116
aVThis is the cortex that processes imagery that comes from the eye.
p117
aVAnd for them, this looked like a circuit diagram.
p118
aVSo there are a lot of details in McCulloch and Pitts's circuit diagram
p119
aVthat are not quite right.
p120
aVBut this basic idea
p121
aVthat visual cortex works like a series of computational elements
p122
aVthat pass information one to the next in a cascade,
p123
aVis essentially correct.
p124
aa(lp125
VLet's talk for a moment
p126
aVabout what a model for processing visual information would need to do.
p127
aVThe basic task of perception
p128
aVis to take an image like this one and say,
p129
aV"That's a bird,"
p130
aVwhich is a very simple thing for us to do with our brains.
p131
aVBut you should all understand that for a computer,
p132
aVthis was pretty much impossible just a few years ago.
p133
aVThe classical computing paradigm
p134
aVis not one in which this task is easy to do.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo what's going on between the pixels,
p137
aVbetween the image of the bird and the word "bird,"
p138
aVis essentially a set of neurons connected to each other
p139
aVin a neural network,
p140
aVas I'm diagramming here.
p141
aVThis neural network could be biological, inside our visual cortices,
p142
aVor, nowadays, we start to have the capability
p143
aVto model such neural networks on the computer.
p144
aVAnd I'll show you what that actually looks like.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo the pixels you can think about as a first layer of neurons,
p147
aVand that's, in fact, how it works in the eye \u2014
p148
aVthat's the neurons in the retina.
p149
aVAnd those feed forward
p150
aVinto one layer after another layer, after another layer of neurons,
p151
aVall connected by synapses of different weights.
p152
aVThe behavior of this network
p153
aVis characterized by the strengths of all of those synapses.
p154
aVThose characterize the computational properties of this network.
p155
aVAnd at the end of the day,
p156
aVyou have a neuron or a small group of neurons
p157
aVthat light up, saying, "bird."
p158
aa(lp159
VNow I'm going to represent those three things \u2014
p160
aVthe input pixels and the synapses in the neural network,
p161
aVand bird, the output \u2014
p162
aVby three variables: x, w and y.
p163
aVThere are maybe a million or so x's \u2014
p164
aVa million pixels in that image.
p165
aVThere are billions or trillions of w's,
p166
aVwhich represent the weights of all these synapses in the neural network.
p167
aVAnd there's a very small number of y's,
p168
aVof outputs that that network has.
p169
aV"Bird" is only four letters, right?
p170
aVSo let's pretend that this is just a simple formula,
p171
aVx "x" w = y.
p172
aVI'm putting the times in scare quotes
p173
aVbecause what's really going on there, of course,
p174
aVis a very complicated series of mathematical operations.
p175
aa(lp176
VThat's one equation.
p177
aVThere are three variables.
p178
aVAnd we all know that if you have one equation,
p179
aVyou can solve one variable by knowing the other two things.
p180
aVSo the problem of inference,
p181
aVthat is, figuring out that the picture of a bird is a bird,
p182
aVis this one:
p183
aVit's where y is the unknown and w and x are known.
p184
aVYou know the neural network, you know the pixels.
p185
aVAs you can see, that's actually a relatively straightforward problem.
p186
aVYou multiply two times three and you're done.
p187
aVI'll show you an artificial neural network
p188
aVthat we've built recently, doing exactly that.
p189
aa(lp190
VThis is running in real time on a mobile phone,
p191
aVand that's, of course, amazing in its own right,
p192
aVthat mobile phones can do so many billions and trillions of operations
p193
aVper second.
p194
aVWhat you're looking at is a phone
p195
aVlooking at one after another picture of a bird,
p196
aVand actually not only saying, "Yes, it's a bird,"
p197
aVbut identifying the species of bird with a network of this sort.
p198
aVSo in that picture,
p199
aVthe x and the w are known, and the y is the unknown.
p200
aVI'm glossing over the very difficult part, of course,
p201
aVwhich is how on earth do we figure out the w,
p202
aVthe brain that can do such a thing?
p203
aVHow would we ever learn such a model?
p204
aa(lp205
VSo this process of learning, of solving for w,
p206
aVif we were doing this with the simple equation
p207
aVin which we think about these as numbers,
p208
aVwe know exactly how to do that: 6 = 2 x w,
p209
aVwell, we divide by two and we're done.
p210
aVThe problem is with this operator.
p211
aVSo, division \u2014
p212
aVwe've used division because it's the inverse to multiplication,
p213
aVbut as I've just said,
p214
aVthe multiplication is a bit of a lie here.
p215
aVThis is a very, very complicated, very non-linear operation;
p216
aVit has no inverse.
p217
aVSo we have to figure out a way to solve the equation
p218
aVwithout a division operator.
p219
aVAnd the way to do that is fairly straightforward.
p220
aVYou just say, let's play a little algebra trick,
p221
aVand move the six over to the right-hand side of the equation.
p222
aVNow, we're still using multiplication.
p223
aVAnd that zero \u2014 let's think about it as an error.
p224
aVIn other words, if we've solved for w the right way,
p225
aVthen the error will be zero.
p226
aVAnd if we haven't gotten it quite right,
p227
aVthe error will be greater than zero.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo now we can just take guesses to minimize the error,
p230
aVand that's the sort of thing computers are very good at.
p231
aVSo you've taken an initial guess:
p232
aVwhat if w = 0?
p233
aVWell, then the error is 6.
p234
aVWhat if w = 1? The error is 4.
p235
aVAnd then the computer can sort of play Marco Polo,
p236
aVand drive down the error close to zero.
p237
aVAs it does that, it's getting successive approximations to w.
p238
aVTypically, it never quite gets there, but after about a dozen steps,
p239
aVwe're up to w = 2.999, which is close enough.
p240
aVAnd this is the learning process.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo remember that what's been going on here
p243
aVis that we've been taking a lot of known x's and known y's
p244
aVand solving for the w in the middle through an iterative process.
p245
aVIt's exactly the same way that we do our own learning.
p246
aVWe have many, many images as babies
p247
aVand we get told, "This is a bird; this is not a bird."
p248
aVAnd over time, through iteration,
p249
aVwe solve for w, we solve for those neural connections.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo now, we've held x and w fixed to solve for y;
p252
aVthat's everyday, fast perception.
p253
aVWe figure out how we can solve for w,
p254
aVthat's learning, which is a lot harder,
p255
aVbecause we need to do error minimization,
p256
aVusing a lot of training examples.
p257
aa(lp258
VAnd about a year ago, Alex Mordvintsev, on our team,
p259
aVdecided to experiment with what happens if we try solving for x,
p260
aVgiven a known w and a known y.
p261
aVIn other words,
p262
aVyou know that it's a bird,
p263
aVand you already have your neural network that you've trained on birds,
p264
aVbut what is the picture of a bird?
p265
aVIt turns out that by using exactly the same error-minimization procedure,
p266
aVone can do that with the network trained to recognize birds,
p267
aVand the result turns out to be ...
p268
aVa picture of birds.
p269
aVSo this is a picture of birds generated entirely by a neural network
p270
aVthat was trained to recognize birds,
p271
aVjust by solving for x rather than solving for y,
p272
aVand doing that iteratively.
p273
aa(lp274
VHere's another fun example.
p275
aVThis was a work made by Mike Tyka in our group,
p276
aVwhich he calls "Animal Parade."
p277
aVIt reminds me a little bit of William Kentridge's artworks,
p278
aVin which he makes sketches, rubs them out,
p279
aVmakes sketches, rubs them out,
p280
aVand creates a movie this way.
p281
aVIn this case,
p282
aVwhat Mike is doing is varying y over the space of different animals,
p283
aVin a network designed to recognize and distinguish
p284
aVdifferent animals from each other.
p285
aVAnd you get this strange, Escher-like morph from one animal to another.
p286
aa(lp287
VHere he and Alex together have tried reducing
p288
aVthe y's to a space of only two dimensions,
p289
aVthereby making a map out of the space of all things
p290
aVrecognized by this network.
p291
aVDoing this kind of synthesis
p292
aVor generation of imagery over that entire surface,
p293
aVvarying y over the surface, you make a kind of map \u2014
p294
aVa visual map of all the things the network knows how to recognize.
p295
aVThe animals are all here; "armadillo" is right in that spot.
p296
aa(lp297
VYou can do this with other kinds of networks as well.
p298
aVThis is a network designed to recognize faces,
p299
aVto distinguish one face from another.
p300
aVAnd here, we're putting in a y that says, "me,"
p301
aVmy own face parameters.
p302
aVAnd when this thing solves for x,
p303
aVit generates this rather crazy,
p304
aVkind of cubist, surreal, psychedelic picture of me
p305
aVfrom multiple points of view at once.
p306
aVThe reason it looks like multiple points of view at once
p307
aVis because that network is designed to get rid of the ambiguity
p308
aVof a face being in one pose or another pose,
p309
aVbeing looked at with one kind of lighting, another kind of lighting.
p310
aVSo when you do this sort of reconstruction,
p311
aVif you don't use some sort of guide image
p312
aVor guide statistics,
p313
aVthen you'll get a sort of confusion of different points of view,
p314
aVbecause it's ambiguous.
p315
aVThis is what happens if Alex uses his own face as a guide image
p316
aVduring that optimization process to reconstruct my own face.
p317
aVSo you can see it's not perfect.
p318
aVThere's still quite a lot of work to do
p319
aVon how we optimize that optimization process.
p320
aVBut you start to get something more like a coherent face,
p321
aVrendered using my own face as a guide.
p322
aa(lp323
VYou don't have to start with a blank canvas
p324
aVor with white noise.
p325
aVWhen you're solving for x,
p326
aVyou can begin with an x, that is itself already some other image.
p327
aVThat's what this little demonstration is.
p328
aVThis is a network that is designed to categorize
p329
aVall sorts of different objects \u2014 man-made structures, animals ...
p330
aVHere we're starting with just a picture of clouds,
p331
aVand as we optimize,
p332
aVbasically, this network is figuring out what it sees in the clouds.
p333
aVAnd the more time you spend looking at this,
p334
aVthe more things you also will see in the clouds.
p335
aVYou could also use the face network to hallucinate into this,
p336
aVand you get some pretty crazy stuff.
p337
aa(lp338
V(Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
VOr, Mike has done some other experiments
p341
aVin which he takes that cloud image,
p342
aVhallucinates, zooms, hallucinates, zooms hallucinates, zooms.
p343
aVAnd in this way,
p344
aVyou can get a sort of fugue state of the network, I suppose,
p345
aVor a sort of free association,
p346
aVin which the network is eating its own tail.
p347
aVSo every image is now the basis for,
p348
aV"What do I think I see next?
p349
aVWhat do I think I see next? What do I think I see next?"
p350
aa(lp351
VI showed this for the first time in public
p352
aVto a group at a lecture in Seattle called "Higher Education" \u2014
p353
aVthis was right after marijuana was legalized.
p354
aa(lp355
V(Laughter)
p356
aa(lp357
VSo I'd like to finish up quickly
p358
aVby just noting that this technology is not constrained.
p359
aVI've shown you purely visual examples because they're really fun to look at.
p360
aVIt's not a purely visual technology.
p361
aVOur artist collaborator, Ross Goodwin,
p362
aVhas done experiments involving a camera that takes a picture,
p363
aVand then a computer in his backpack writes a poem using neural networks,
p364
aVbased on the contents of the image.
p365
aVAnd that poetry neural network has been trained
p366
aVon a large corpus of 20th-century poetry.
p367
aVAnd the poetry is, you know,
p368
aVI think, kind of not bad, actually.
p369
aa(lp370
V(Laughter)
p371
aa(lp372
VIn closing,
p373
aVI think that per Michelangelo,
p374
aVI think he was right;
p375
aVperception and creativity are very intimately connected.
p376
aVWhat we've just seen are neural networks
p377
aVthat are entirely trained to discriminate,
p378
aVor to recognize different things in the world,
p379
aVable to be run in reverse, to generate.
p380
aVOne of the things that suggests to me
p381
aVis not only that Michelangelo really did see
p382
aVthe sculpture in the blocks of stone,
p383
aVbut that any creature, any being, any alien
p384
aVthat is able to do perceptual acts of that sort
p385
aVis also able to create
p386
aVbecause it's exactly the same machinery that's used in both cases.
p387
aa(lp388
VAlso, I think that perception and creativity are by no means
p389
aVuniquely human.
p390
aVWe start to have computer models that can do exactly these sorts of things.
p391
aVAnd that ought to be unsurprising; the brain is computational.
p392
aa(lp393
VAnd finally,
p394
aVcomputing began as an exercise in designing intelligent machinery.
p395
aVIt was very much modeled after the idea
p396
aVof how could we make machines intelligent.
p397
aVAnd we finally are starting to fulfill now
p398
aVsome of the promises of those early pioneers,
p399
aVof Turing and von Neumann
p400
aVand McCulloch and Pitts.
p401
aVAnd I think that computing is not just about accounting
p402
aVor playing Candy Crush or something.
p403
aVFrom the beginning, we modeled them after our minds.
p404
aVAnd they give us both the ability to understand our own minds better
p405
aVand to extend them.
