VWhat's happening to the climate?
p4
aVIt is unbelievably bad.
p5
aVThis is, obviously, that famous view now of the Arctic,
p6
aVwhich is likely to be gone at this point
p7
aVin the next three or four or five years. Very, very, very scary.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo we all look at what we can do.
p10
aVAnd when you look at the worldwide sources of CO2,
p11
aV52 percent are tied to buildings.
p12
aVOnly nine percent is passenger cars, interestingly enough.
p13
aVSo we ran off to a sushi bar.
p14
aVAnd at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea.
p15
aVAnd it was something called EcoRock.
p16
aVAnd we said we could redesign the 115-year-old
p17
aVgypsum drywall process that generates
p18
aV20 billion pounds of CO2 a year.
p19
aVSo it was a big idea. We wanted to reduce that by 80 percent,
p20
aVwhich is exactly what we've done.
p21
aa(lp22
VWe started R&D in 2006.
p23
aVDecided to use recycled content from cement
p24
aVand steel manufacturing.
p25
aVThere is the inside of our lab. We haven't shown this before.
p26
aVBut our people had to do some 5,000
p27
aVdifferent mixes to get this right, to hit our targets.
p28
aVAnd they worked absolutely very, very, very hard.
p29
aVSo then we went forward and built our production line in China.
p30
aVWe don't build this production equipment any longer in the U.S., unfortunately.
p31
aa(lp32
VWe did the line install over the summer.
p33
aVWe started right there, with absolutely nothing.
p34
aVYou're seeing for the first time, a brand new drywall production line,
p35
aVnot made using gypsum at all.
p36
aVThat's the finished production line there.
p37
aVWe got our first panel out on December third.
p38
aVThat is the slurry being poured onto paper, basically. That's the line running.
p39
aVThe exciting thing is, look at the faces of the people.
p40
aVThese are people who worked this project for two to three years.
p41
aVAnd they are so excited. That's the first board off the line.
p42
aVOur Vice President of Operation kissing the board. Obviously very, very excited.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut this has a huge, huge impact on the environment.
p45
aVWe signed the first panel just a few weeks after that, had a great signing ceremony,
p46
aVleading to people hopefully using these products across the world.
p47
aVAnd we've got Cradle-to-Cradle Gold on this thing.
p48
aVWe happened to win, just recently, the Green Product of the Year
p49
aVfor "The Re-Invention of Drywall," from Popular Science.
p50
aVThank you. Thank you.
p51
aVSo here is what we learned: 8,000 gallons of gas
p52
aVequivalent to build one house.
p53
aVYou probably had no idea. It's like driving around the world six times.
p54
aa(lp55
VWe must change everything.
p56
aVLook around the room: chairs, wood,
p57
aVeverything around us has to change or we're not going to lick this problem.
p58
aVDon't listen to the people who say you can't do this, because anyone can.
p59
aVAnd these job losses, we can fix them with green-collar jobs.
p60
aVWe've got four plants. We're building this stuff around the country.
p61
aVWe're going as fast as we can.
p62
aVTwo and a half million cars worth of gypsum,
p63
aVyou know, CO2 generated. Right?
p64
aVSo what will you do? I'll tell you what I did and why I did it. And I know my time's up.
p65
aa(lp66
VThose are my kids, Natalie and David.
p67
aVWhen they have their kids, 2050,
p68
aVthey'd better look back at Grandpa and say,
p69
aV"Hey, you gave it a good shot. You did the best you could
p70
aVwith the team that you had."
p71
aVSo my hope is that when you leave TED,
p72
aVyou will look at reducing your carbon footprint
p73
aVin however you can do it.
p74
aVAnd if you don't know how, please find me \u2014 I will help you.
p75
aa(lp76
VLast but not least, Bill Gates, I know you invented Windows.
p77
aVWait till you see, maybe next year, what kind of windows we've invented.
p78
aVThank you so much.
