VB.J. was one of many fellow inmates
p4
aVwho had big plans for the future.
p5
aVHe had a vision. When he got out,
p6
aVhe was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight,
p7
aVand he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision.
p8
aVHe'd spent 10,000 dollars
p9
aVto buy a website that exclusively featured women
p10
aVhaving sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars. (Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VIt was my first week in federal prison,
p13
aVand I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you see on TV.
p14
aVIn fact, it was teeming with smart, ambitious men
p15
aVwhose business instincts were in many cases
p16
aVas sharp as those of the CEOs
p17
aVwho had wined and dined me six months earlier
p18
aVwhen I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate.
p19
aVNow, 95 percent of the guys that I was locked up with
p20
aVhad been drug dealers on the outside,
p21
aVbut when they talked about what they did,
p22
aVthey talked about it in a different jargon,
p23
aVbut the business concepts that they talked about
p24
aVweren't unlike those that you'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton:
p25
aVpromotional incentives, you never charge a first-time user,
p26
aVfocus-grouping new product launches,
p27
aVterritorial expansion.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days.
p30
aVFor the most part, everyone was just trying to survive.
p31
aVIt's a lot harder than you might think.
p32
aVContrary to what most people think,
p33
aVpeople don't pay, taxpayers don't pay, for your life
p34
aVwhen you're in prison. You've got to pay for your own life.
p35
aVYou've got to pay for your soap, your deodorant,
p36
aVtoothbrush, toothpaste, all of it.
p37
aVAnd it's hard for a couple of reasons.
p38
aVFirst, everything's marked up 30 to 50 percent
p39
aVfrom what you'd pay on the street,
p40
aVand second, you don't make a lot of money.
p41
aVI unloaded trucks. That was my full-time job,
p42
aVunloading trucks at a food warehouse,
p43
aVfor $5.25, not an hour, but per month.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo how do you survive?
p46
aVWell, you learn to hustle, all kinds of hustles.
p47
aVThere's legal hustles.
p48
aVYou pay everything in stamps. Those are the currency.
p49
aVYou charge another inmate to clean his cell.
p50
aVThere's sort of illegal hustles, like you run a barbershop out of your cell.
p51
aVThere's pretty illegal hustles: You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell.
p52
aVAnd there's very illegal hustles, which you smuggle in,
p53
aVyou get smuggled in, drugs, pornography,
p54
aVcell phones, and just as in the outer world,
p55
aVthere's a risk-reward tradeoff, so the riskier the enterprise,
p56
aVthe more profitable it can potentially be.
p57
aVYou want a cigarette in prison? Three to five dollars.
p58
aVYou want an old-fashioned cell phone that you flip open
p59
aVand is about as big as your head? Three hundred bucks.
p60
aVYou want a dirty magazine?
p61
aVWell, it can be as much as 1,000 dollars.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo as you can probably tell, one of the defining aspects
p64
aVof prison life is ingenuity.
p65
aVWhether it was concocting delicious meals
p66
aVfrom stolen scraps from the warehouse,
p67
aVsculpting people's hair with toenail clippers,
p68
aVor constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags
p69
aVtied on to tree limbs, prisoners learn how to make do with less,
p70
aVand many of them want to take this ingenuity
p71
aVthat they've learned to the outside
p72
aVand start restaurants, barber shops,
p73
aVpersonal training businesses.
p74
aa(lp75
VBut there's no training, nothing to prepare them for that,
p76
aVno rehabilitation at all in prison,
p77
aVno one to help them write a business plan,
p78
aVfigure out a way to translate the business concepts
p79
aVthey intuitively grasp into legal enterprises,
p80
aVno access to the Internet, even.
p81
aVAnd then, when they come out, most states
p82
aVdon't even have a law prohibiting employers
p83
aVfrom discriminating against people with a background.
p84
aVSo none of us should be surprised
p85
aVthat two out of three ex-offenders re-offend
p86
aVwithin five years.
p87
aa(lp88
VLook, I lied to the Feds. I lost a year of my life from it.
p89
aVBut when I came out, I vowed that I was going to do
p90
aVwhatever I could to make sure
p91
aVthat guys like the ones I was locked up with
p92
aVdidn't have to waste any more of their life than they already had.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo I hope that you'll think about helping in some way.
p95
aVThe best thing we can do is figure out ways
p96
aVto nurture the entrepreneurial spirit
p97
aVand the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons,
p98
aVbecause if we don't, they're not going to learn any new skills
p99
aVthat's going to help them, and they'll be right back.
p100
aVAll they'll learn on the inside is new hustles.
p101
aVThank you. (Applause)
