VThe anger in me against corruption
p4
aVmade me to make a big career change
p5
aVlast year, becoming a full-time practicing lawyer.
p6
aVMy experiences over the last 18 months,
p7
aVas a lawyer, has seeded in me
p8
aVa new entrepreneurial idea,
p9
aVwhich I believe is indeed
p10
aVworth spreading.
p11
aVSo, I share it with all of you here today,
p12
aVthough the idea itself is getting crystallized
p13
aVand I'm still writing up the business plan.
p14
aVOf course it helps that fear of public failure
p15
aVdiminishes as the number of ideas
p16
aVwhich have failed increases.
p17
aa(lp18
VI've been a huge fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship
p19
aVsince 1993.
p20
aVI've explored, experienced,
p21
aVand experimented enterprise
p22
aVand capitalism to my heart's content.
p23
aVI built, along with my two brothers,
p24
aVthe leading real estate company in my home state, Kerala,
p25
aVand then worked professionally
p26
aVwith two of India's biggest businessmen,
p27
aVbut in their startup enterprises.
p28
aVIn 2003, when I stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector
p29
aVto work on so-called social sector issues,
p30
aVI definitely did not have any grand strategy
p31
aVor plan to pursue and find
p32
aVfor-profit solutions
p33
aVto addressing pressing public issues.
p34
aa(lp35
VWhen life brought about a series
p36
aVof death and near-death experiences
p37
aVwithin my close circle,
p38
aVwhich highlighted the need
p39
aVfor an emergency medical response service in India,
p40
aVsimilar to 911 in USA.
p41
aVTo address this, I, along with four friends,
p42
aVfounded Ambulance Access for All,
p43
aVto promote life-support ambulance services in India.
p44
aVFor those from the developing world,
p45
aVthere is nothing, absolutely nothing new in this idea.
p46
aVBut as we envisioned it,
p47
aVwe had three key goals:
p48
aVProviding world-class life support ambulance service
p49
aVwhich is fully self-sustainable from its own revenue streams,
p50
aVand universally accessible
p51
aVto anyone in a medical emergency,
p52
aVirrespective of the capability to pay.
p53
aVThe service which grew out of this,
p54
aVDial 1298 for Ambulance,
p55
aVwith one ambulance in 2004,
p56
aVnow has a hundred-plus ambulances in three states,
p57
aVand has transported over 100,000 patients
p58
aVand victims since inception.
p59
aa(lp60
VThe service is \u2014 (Applause)
p61
aVfully self-sustainable from its own revenues,
p62
aVwithout accessing any public funds,
p63
aVand the cross-subsidy model actually works,
p64
aVwhere the rich pays higher, poor pays lower,
p65
aVand the accident victim is getting the service free of charge.
p66
aVThe service responded effectively
p67
aVand efficiently,
p68
aVduring the unfortunate
p69
aV26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.
p70
aVAnd as you can see from the visuals,
p71
aVthe service was responding and rescuing
p72
aVvictims from the incident locations
p73
aVeven before the police could cordon off
p74
aVthe incident locations
p75
aVand formally confirm it as a terror strike.
p76
aVWe ended up being the first medical response team
p77
aVin every incident location
p78
aVand transported 125 victims,
p79
aVsaving life.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Applause)
p82
aa(lp83
VIn tribute and remembrance
p84
aVof 26/11 attacks
p85
aVover the last one year,
p86
aVwe have actually helped a Pakistani NGO,
p87
aVAman Foundation,
p88
aVto set up a self-sustainable life support ambulance service
p89
aVin Karachi, facilitated by Acumen Fund.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Applause)
p92
aa(lp93
VIt's a small message from us,
p94
aVin our own small way
p95
aVto the enemies of humanity,
p96
aVof Islam, of South Asia,
p97
aVof India, and of Pakistan,
p98
aVthat humanity will continue to bloom,
p99
aVirrespective of such dastardly attacks.
p100
aVSince then I've also co-founded two other social enterprises.
p101
aVOne is Education Access for All,
p102
aVsetting up schools in small-town India.
p103
aVAnd the other is Moksha-Yug Access,
p104
aVwhich is integrating rural supply chain
p105
aVon the foundations of self-help group-based microfinance.
p106
aVI guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right.
p107
aVBecause diligent investors and venture funds
p108
aVhave committed over 7.5 million dollars in funding.
p109
aVWith the significance being these funds have come in
p110
aVas a QT capital, not as grant or as philanthropy.
p111
aa(lp112
VNow I come back to the idea of the new social enterprise
p113
aVthat I'm exploring.
p114
aVCorruption, bribes, and lack of transparency.
p115
aVYou may be surprised to know
p116
aVthat eight speakers yesterday
p117
aVactually mentioned these terms in their talks.
p118
aVBribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side,
p119
aVwith the supply side being mostly of
p120
aVgreedy corporate unethical businesses
p121
aVand hapless common man.
p122
aVAnd the demand side being mostly politicians,
p123
aVbureaucrats and those who have discretionary power
p124
aVvested with them.
p125
aa(lp126
VAccording to World Bank estimate,
p127
aVone trillion dollars is paid in bribes
p128
aVevery year, worsening the condition
p129
aVof the already worse off.
p130
aVYet, if you analyze the common man,
p131
aVhe or she does not wake up every day and say,
p132
aV"Hmm, let me see who I can pay a bribe to today."
p133
aVor, "Let me see who I can corrupt today."
p134
aVOften it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation
p135
aVthat the hapless common man finds himself or herself in
p136
aVthat leads him to pay a bribe.
p137
aVIn the modern day world, where time is premium
p138
aVand battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough,
p139
aVthe hapless common man
p140
aVsimply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life.
p141
aa(lp142
VNow, let me ask you another question.
p143
aVImagine you are being asked to pay a bribe
p144
aVin your day-to-day life to get something done.
p145
aVWhat do you do? Of course you can call the police.
p146
aVBut what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption?
p147
aVMost definitely you don't want to pay the bribe.
p148
aVBut you also don't have the time, resources,
p149
aVexpertise or wherewithal to fight this.
p150
aVUnfortunately, many of us in this room
p151
aVare supporters of capitalist policies and market forces.
p152
aa(lp153
VYet the market forces around the world
p154
aVhave not yet thrown up a service where you can call in,
p155
aVpay a fee, and fight the demand for a bribe.
p156
aVLike a bribe buster service,
p157
aVor 1-800-Fight-Bribes,
p158
aVor www.stopbribes.org or
p159
aVwww.preventcorruption.org.
p160
aVSuch a service simply do not exist.
p161
aVOne image that has haunted me
p162
aVfrom my early business days
p163
aVis of a grandmother, 70 plus years, being harassed
p164
aVby the bureaucrats in the town planning office.
p165
aVAll she needed was permission to build three steps
p166
aVto her house, from ground level,
p167
aVmaking it easier for her to enter and exit her house.
p168
aVYet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit
p169
aVfor want of a bribe.
p170
aVEven though it pricked my conscience then,
p171
aVI could not, or rather I did not
p172
aVtend to her or assist her,
p173
aVbecause I was busy building my real estate company.
p174
aVI don't want to be haunted by such images any more.
p175
aa(lp176
VA group of us have been working on a pilot basis
p177
aVto address individual instances of demands
p178
aVfor bribes for common services or entitlement.
p179
aVAnd in all 42 cases where we have pushed back such demands
p180
aVusing existing and legitimate tools
p181
aVlike the Right to Information Act,
p182
aVvideo, audio, or peer pressure,
p183
aVwe have successfully obtained whatever our clients
p184
aVset out to achieve without actually paying a bribe.
p185
aVAnd with the cost of these tools being substantially lower
p186
aVthan the bribe demanded.
p187
aVI believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases
p188
aVcan be consolidated in standard processes
p189
aVin a BPO kind of environment,
p190
aVand made available on web, call-center
p191
aVand franchise physical offices,
p192
aVfor a fee, to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe.
p193
aVThe target market is as tempting as it can get.
p194
aVIt can be worth up to one trillion dollars,
p195
aVbeing paid in bribes every year,
p196
aVor equal to India's GDP.
p197
aVAnd it is an absolutely virgin market.
p198
aa(lp199
VI propose to explore this idea further,
p200
aVto examine the potential of creating
p201
aVa for-profit, fee-based BPO
p202
aVkind of service to stop bribes
p203
aVand prevent corruption.
p204
aVI do realize that the fight for justice
p205
aVagainst corruption is never easy.
p206
aVIt never has been and it never will be.
p207
aVIn my last 18 months as a lawyer,
p208
aVbattling small- and large-scale corruption,
p209
aVincluding the one perpetrated by India's biggest corporate scamster.
p210
aVThrough his charities
p211
aVI have had three police cases filed against me
p212
aValleging trespass, impersonation and intimidation.
p213
aVThe battle against corruption
p214
aVexacts a toll on ourselves,
p215
aVour families, our friends, and even our kids.
p216
aVYet I believe the price we pay is well worth holding on
p217
aVto our dignity and making the world a fairer place.
p218
aa(lp219
VWhat gives us the courage?
p220
aVAs my close friend replied, when told
p221
aVduring the seeding days of the ambulance project
p222
aVthat it is an impossible task
p223
aVand the founders are insane to chalk up their blue-chip jobs,
p224
aVI quote: "Of course we cannot fail in this,
p225
aVat least in our own minds.
p226
aVFor we are insane people,
p227
aVtrying to do an impossible task.
p228
aVAnd an insane person does not know what an impossible task is." Thank you.

aa(lp232
VChris Anderson: Shaffi, that is a really exciting business idea.
p233
aVShaffi Mather: I just have to get through the initial days where I don't get eliminated.
p234
aa(lp235
V(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
VCA: What's on your mind?
p238
aVI mean, give us a sense of the numbers here \u2014
p239
aVa typical bribe and a typical fee. I mean, what's in your head?
p240
aa(lp241
VSM: So let me ... Let me give you an example.
p242
aVSomebody who had applied for the passport.
p243
aVThe officer was just sitting on it
p244
aVand was demanding around 3,000 rupees in bribes.
p245
aVAnd he did not want to pay.
p246
aVSo we actually used the Right to Information Act,
p247
aVwhich is equal to the Freedom of Information Act in the United States,
p248
aVand pushed back the officers in this particular case.
p249
aVAnd in all these 42 cases,
p250
aVwhen we kept pushing them back,
p251
aVthere was three kinds of reaction.
p252
aVA set of people actually say,
p253
aV"Oh, let me just grant it to them, and run away from it."
p254
aVSome people actually come back and say,
p255
aV"Oh, you want to screw me. Let me show you what I can do."
p256
aVAnd he will push us back.
p257
aVSo you take the next step, or use the next tool available
p258
aVin what we are putting together,
p259
aVand then he relents.
p260
aVBy the third time, in all 42 cases, we have achieved success.
p261
aa(lp262
VCA: But if it's a 3,000-rupee, 70-dollar bribe,
p263
aVwhat fee would you have to charge,
p264
aVand can you actually make the business work?
p265
aa(lp266
VSM: Well, actually the cost that we incurred
p267
aVwas less than 200 rupees.
p268
aVSo, it actually works.
p269
aa(lp270
VCA: That's a high gross margin business. I like it.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VSM: I actually did not want to answer this on the TED stage.
p275
aa(lp276
VCA: OK, so these are provisional numbers, no pricing guarantee.
p277
aVIf you can pull this off, you will be a global hero.
p278
aVI mean, this could be huge.
p279
aVThank you so much for sharing this idea at TED.
