VMy title: "Queerer than we can suppose: the strangeness of science."
p4
aV"Queerer than we can suppose" comes from J.B.S. Haldane, the famous biologist,
p5
aVwho said, "Now, my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer
p6
aVthan we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.
p7
aVI suspect that there are more things in heaven and earth
p8
aVthan are dreamed of, or can be dreamed of, in any philosophy."
p9
aVRichard Feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories \u2014
p10
aVexperimental predictions \u2014
p11
aVto specifying the width of North America to within one hair's breadth of accuracy.
p12
aVThis means that quantum theory has got to be, in some sense, true.
p13
aVYet the assumptions that quantum theory needs to make
p14
aVin order to deliver those predictions are so mysterious
p15
aVthat even Feynman himself was moved to remark,
p16
aV"If you think you understand quantum theory,
p17
aVyou don't understand quantum theory."
p18
aa(lp19
VIt's so queer that physicists resort to one or another
p20
aVparadoxical interpretation of it.
p21
aVDavid Deutsch, who's talking here, in "The Fabric of Reality,"
p22
aVembraces the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory,
p23
aVbecause the worst that you can say about it
p24
aVis that it's preposterously wasteful.
p25
aVIt postulates a vast and rapidly growing number of universes existing in parallel,
p26
aVmutually undetectable,
p27
aVexcept through the narrow porthole of quantum mechanical experiments.
p28
aVAnd that's Richard Feynman.
p29
aa(lp30
VThe biologist Lewis Wolpert believes
p31
aVthat the queerness of modern physics
p32
aVis just an extreme example.
p33
aVScience, as opposed to technology,
p34
aVdoes violence to common sense.
p35
aVEvery time you drink a glass of water, he points out,
p36
aVthe odds are that you will imbibe at least one molecule
p37
aVthat passed through the bladder of Oliver Cromwell.
p38
aV(Laughter)
p39
aVIt's just elementary probability theory.
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VThe number of molecules per glassful is hugely greater
p44
aVthan the number of glassfuls, or bladdersful, in the world.
p45
aVAnd of course, there's nothing special about Cromwell or bladders \u2014
p46
aVyou have just breathed in a nitrogen atom
p47
aVthat passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon
p48
aVto the left of the tall cycad tree.
p49
aa(lp50
V"Queerer than we can suppose."
p51
aVWhat is it that makes us capable of supposing anything,
p52
aVand does this tell us anything about what we can suppose?
p53
aVAre there things about the universe that will be forever beyond our grasp,
p54
aVbut not beyond the grasp of some superior intelligence?
p55
aVAre there things about the universe
p56
aVthat are, in principle, ungraspable by any mind,
p57
aVhowever superior?
p58
aVThe history of science has been one long series of violent brainstorms,
p59
aVas successive generations have come to terms with
p60
aVincreasing levels of queerness in the universe.
p61
aVWe're now so used to the idea that the Earth spins,
p62
aVrather than the Sun moves across the sky,
p63
aVit's hard for us to realize
p64
aVwhat a shattering mental revolution that must have been.
p65
aVAfter all, it seems obvious that the Earth is large and motionless,
p66
aVthe Sun, small and mobile.
p67
aVBut it's worth recalling Wittgenstein's remark on the subject:
p68
aV"Tell me," he asked a friend, "why do people always say
p69
aVit was natural for man to assume that the Sun went 'round the Earth,
p70
aVrather than that the Earth was rotating?"
p71
aVAnd his friend replied, "Well, obviously,
p72
aVbecause it just looks as though the Sun is going round the Earth."
p73
aVWittgenstein replied, "Well, what would it have looked like
p74
aVif it had looked as though the Earth was rotating?"
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VScience has taught us, against all intuition,
p79
aVthat apparently solid things, like crystals and rocks,
p80
aVare really almost entirely composed of empty space.
p81
aVAnd the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom
p82
aVis a fly in the middle of a sports stadium,
p83
aVand the next atom is in the next sports stadium.
p84
aVSo it would seem the hardest, solidest, densest rock
p85
aVis really almost entirely empty space,
p86
aVbroken only by tiny particles so widely spaced they shouldn't count.
p87
aVWhy, then, do rocks look and feel solid and hard and impenetrable?
p88
aVAs an evolutionary biologist, I'd say this: our brains have evolved
p89
aVto help us survive within the orders of magnitude, of size and speed
p90
aVwhich our bodies operate at.
p91
aVWe never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms.
p92
aVIf we had, our brains probably would perceive rocks
p93
aVas full of empty space.
p94
aVRocks feel hard and impenetrable
p95
aVto our hands, precisely because objects like rocks and hands
p96
aVcannot penetrate each other.
p97
aVIt's therefore useful
p98
aVfor our brains to construct notions like "solidity" and "impenetrability,"
p99
aVbecause such notions help us to navigate our bodies
p100
aVthrough the middle-sized world in which we have to navigate.
p101
aa(lp102
VMoving to the other end of the scale,
p103
aVour ancestors never had to navigate through the cosmos
p104
aVat speeds close to the speed of light.
p105
aVIf they had, our brains would be much better at understanding Einstein.
p106
aVI want to give the name "Middle World" to the medium-scaled environment
p107
aVin which we've evolved the ability to take act \u2014
p108
aVnothing to do with "Middle Earth" \u2014
p109
aVMiddle World.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VWe are evolved denizens of Middle World,
p114
aVand that limits what we are capable of imagining.
p115
aVWe find it intuitively easy to grasp ideas like,
p116
aVwhen a rabbit moves at the sort of medium velocity
p117
aVat which rabbits and other Middle World objects move,
p118
aVand hits another Middle World object like a rock, it knocks itself out.
p119
aa(lp120
VMay I introduce Major General Albert Stubblebine III,
p121
aVcommander of military intelligence in 1983.
p122
aa(lp123
V"...[He] stared at his wall in Arlington, Virginia, and decided to do it.
p124
aVAs frightening as the prospect was, he was going into the next office.
p125
aVHe stood up and moved out from behind his desk.
p126
aV'What is the atom mostly made of?' he thought, 'Space.'
p127
aVHe started walking. 'What am I mostly made of? Atoms.'
p128
aVHe quickened his pace, almost to a jog now.
p129
aV'What is the wall mostly made of?'
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
V'Atoms!'
p134
aVAll I have to do is merge the spaces.
p135
aVThen, General Stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall of his office.
p136
aVStubblebine, who commanded 16,000 soldiers,
p137
aVwas confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall.
p138
aVHe has no doubt that this ability will one day be a common tool
p139
aVin the military arsenal.
p140
aVWho would screw around with an army that could do that?"
p141
aa(lp142
VThat's from an article in Playboy,
p143
aVwhich I was reading the other day.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VI have every reason to think it's true;
p148
aVI was reading Playboy because I, myself, had an article in it.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VUnaided human intuition, schooled in Middle World,
p153
aVfinds it hard to believe Galileo when he tells us
p154
aVa heavy object and a light object, air friction aside,
p155
aVwould hit the ground at the same instant.
p156
aVAnd that's because in Middle World, air friction is always there.
p157
aVIf we'd evolved in a vacuum,
p158
aVwe would expect them to hit the ground simultaneously.
p159
aVIf we were bacteria,
p160
aVconstantly buffeted by thermal movements of molecules,
p161
aVit would be different.
p162
aVBut we Middle-Worlders are too big to notice Brownian motion.
p163
aVIn the same way, our lives are dominated by gravity,
p164
aVbut are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension.
p165
aVA small insect would reverse these priorities.
p166
aa(lp167
VSteve Grand \u2014 he's the one on the left,
p168
aVDouglas Adams is on the right.
p169
aVSteve Grand, in his book, "Creation: Life and How to Make It,"
p170
aVis positively scathing about our preoccupation with matter itself.
p171
aVWe have this tendency to think that only solid, material things
p172
aVare really things at all.
p173
aVWaves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal.
p174
aVVictorians thought the waves had to be waves in some material medium:
p175
aVthe ether.
p176
aVBut we find real matter comforting
p177
aVonly because we've evolved to survive in Middle World,
p178
aVwhere matter is a useful fiction.
p179
aVA whirlpool, for Steve Grand, is a thing with just as much reality
p180
aVas a rock.
p181
aa(lp182
VIn a desert plain in Tanzania,
p183
aVin the shadow of the volcano Ol Doinyo Lengai,
p184
aVthere's a dune made of volcanic ash.
p185
aVThe beautiful thing is that it moves bodily.
p186
aVIt's what's technically known as a "barchan,"
p187
aVand the entire dune walks across the desert in a westerly direction
p188
aVat a speed of about 17 meters per year.
p189
aVIt retains its crescent shape and moves in the direction of the horns.
p190
aVWhat happens is that the wind blows the sand up the shallow slope
p191
aVon the other side,
p192
aVand then, as each sand grain hits the top of the ridge, it cascades down
p193
aVon the inside of the crescent,
p194
aVand so the whole horn-shaped dune moves.
p195
aVSteve Grand points out that you and I are, ourselves,
p196
aVmore like a wave than a permanent thing.
p197
aVHe invites us, the reader,
p198
aVto think of an experience from your childhood,
p199
aVsomething you remember clearly,
p200
aVsomething you can see, feel, maybe even smell,
p201
aVas if you were really there.
p202
aVAfter all, you really were there at the time, weren't you?
p203
aVHow else would you remember it?
p204
aVBut here is the bombshell: You weren't there.
p205
aVNot a single atom that is in your body today
p206
aVwas there when that event took place.
p207
aVMatter flows from place to place
p208
aVand momentarily comes together to be you.
p209
aVWhatever you are, therefore,
p210
aVyou are not the stuff of which you are made.
p211
aVIf that doesn't make the hair stand up on the back of your neck,
p212
aVread it again until it does, because it is important.
p213
aa(lp214
VSo "really" isn't a word that we should use with simple confidence.
p215
aVIf a neutrino had a brain,
p216
aVwhich it evolved in neutrino-sized ancestors,
p217
aVit would say that rocks really do consist of empty space.
p218
aVWe have brains that evolved in medium-sized ancestors
p219
aVwhich couldn't walk through rocks.
p220
aV"Really," for an animal, is whatever its brain needs it to be
p221
aVin order to assist its survival.
p222
aVAnd because different species live in different worlds,
p223
aVthere will be a discomforting variety of "reallys."
p224
aVWhat we see of the real world is not the unvarnished world,
p225
aVbut a model of the world, regulated and adjusted by sense data,
p226
aVbut constructed so it's useful for dealing with the real world.
p227
aa(lp228
VThe nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are.
p229
aVA flying animal needs a different kind of model
p230
aVfrom a walking, climbing or swimming animal.
p231
aVA monkey's brain must have software capable of simulating
p232
aVa three-dimensional world of branches and trunks.
p233
aVA mole's software for constructing models of its world will be customized
p234
aVfor underground use.
p235
aVA water strider's brain doesn't need 3D software at all,
p236
aVsince it lives on the surface of the pond,
p237
aVin an Edwin Abbott flatland.
p238
aa(lp239
VI've speculated that bats may see color with their ears.
p240
aVThe world model that a bat needs in order to navigate
p241
aVthrough three dimensions catching insects
p242
aVmust be pretty similar to the world model that any flying bird \u2014
p243
aVa day-flying bird like a swallow \u2014 needs to perform the same kind of tasks.
p244
aVThe fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness
p245
aVto input the current variables to its model,
p246
aVwhile the swallow uses light, is incidental.
p247
aVBats, I've even suggested, use perceived hues, such as red and blue,
p248
aVas labels, internal labels, for some useful aspect of echoes \u2014
p249
aVperhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces, furry or smooth and so on \u2014
p250
aVin the same way as swallows or indeed, we, use those perceived hues \u2014
p251
aVredness and blueness, etc. \u2014
p252
aVto label long and short wavelengths of light.
p253
aVThere's nothing inherent about red that makes it long wavelength.
p254
aa(lp255
VThe point is that the nature of the model is governed by how it is to be used,
p256
aVrather than by the sensory modality involved.
p257
aVJ.B.S. Haldane himself had something to say about animals
p258
aVwhose world is dominated by smell.
p259
aVDogs can distinguish two very similar fatty acids, extremely diluted:
p260
aVcaprylic acid and caproic acid.
p261
aVThe only difference, you see,
p262
aVis that one has an extra pair of carbon atoms in the chain.
p263
aVHaldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids
p264
aVin the order of their molecular weights by their smells,
p265
aVjust as a man could place a number of piano wires
p266
aVin the order of their lengths by means of their notes.
p267
aVNow, there's another fatty acid, capric acid,
p268
aVwhich is just like the other two,
p269
aVexcept that it has two more carbon atoms.
p270
aVA dog that had never met capric acid would, perhaps,
p271
aVhave no more trouble imagining its smell
p272
aVthan we would have trouble imagining a trumpet, say,
p273
aVplaying one note higher than we've heard a trumpet play before.
p274
aVPerhaps dogs and rhinos and other smell-oriented animals smell in color.
p275
aVAnd the argument would be exactly the same as for the bats.
p276
aa(lp277
VMiddle World \u2014 the range of sizes and speeds
p278
aVwhich we have evolved to feel intuitively comfortable with \u2014
p279
aVis a bit like the narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum
p280
aVthat we see as light of various colors.
p281
aVWe're blind to all frequencies outside that,
p282
aVunless we use instruments to help us.
p283
aVMiddle World is the narrow range of reality
p284
aVwhich we judge to be normal, as opposed to the queerness
p285
aVof the very small, the very large and the very fast.
p286
aVWe could make a similar scale of improbabilities;
p287
aVnothing is totally impossible.
p288
aVMiracles are just events that are extremely improbable.
p289
aVA marble statue could wave its hand at us;
p290
aVthe atoms that make up its crystalline structure
p291
aVare all vibrating back and forth anyway.
p292
aVBecause there are so many of them,
p293
aVand because there's no agreement among them
p294
aVin their preferred direction of movement,
p295
aVthe marble, as we see it in Middle World, stays rock steady.
p296
aVBut the atoms in the hand could all just happen to move
p297
aVthe same way at the same time, and again and again.
p298
aVIn this case, the hand would move,
p299
aVand we'd see it waving at us in Middle World.
p300
aVThe odds against it, of course, are so great
p301
aVthat if you set out writing zeros at the time of the origin of the universe,
p302
aVyou still would not have written enough zeros to this day.
p303
aa(lp304
VEvolution in Middle World has not equipped us
p305
aVto handle very improbable events; we don't live long enough.
p306
aVIn the vastness of astronomical space and geological time,
p307
aVthat which seems impossible in Middle World
p308
aVmight turn out to be inevitable.
p309
aVOne way to think about that is by counting planets.
p310
aVWe don't know how many planets there are in the universe,
p311
aVbut a good estimate is about 10 to the 20, or 100 billion billion.
p312
aVAnd that gives us a nice way to express our estimate of life's improbability.
p313
aVWe could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability,
p314
aVwhich might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at.
p315
aa(lp316
VIf life has arisen only once on any \u2014
p317
aVlife could originate once per planet, could be extremely common
p318
aVor it could originate once per star
p319
aVor once per galaxy or maybe only once in the entire universe,
p320
aVin which case it would have to be here.
p321
aVAnd somewhere up there would be the chance
p322
aVthat a frog would turn into a prince,
p323
aVand similar magical things like that.
p324
aVIf life has arisen on only one planet in the entire universe,
p325
aVthat planet has to be our planet, because here we are talking about it.
p326
aVAnd that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it,
p327
aVwe're allowed to postulate chemical events in the origin of life
p328
aVwhich have a probability as low as one in 100 billion billion.
p329
aVI don't think we shall have to avail ourselves of that,
p330
aVbecause I suspect that life is quite common in the universe.
p331
aVAnd when I say quite common, it could still be so rare
p332
aVthat no one island of life ever encounters another,
p333
aVwhich is a sad thought.
p334
aa(lp335
VHow shall we interpret "queerer than we can suppose?"
p336
aVQueerer than can in principle be supposed,
p337
aVor just queerer than we can suppose, given the limitations
p338
aVof our brain's evolutionary apprenticeship in Middle World?
p339
aVCould we, by training and practice,
p340
aVemancipate ourselves from Middle World
p341
aVand achieve some sort of intuitive as well as mathematical understanding
p342
aVof the very small and the very large?
p343
aVI genuinely don't know the answer.
p344
aVI wonder whether we might help ourselves to understand, say, quantum theory,
p345
aVif we brought up children to play computer games
p346
aVbeginning in early childhood,
p347
aVwhich had a make-believe world of balls going through two slits on a screen,
p348
aVa world in which the strange goings-on of quantum mechanics were enlarged
p349
aVby the computer's make-believe,
p350
aVso that they became familiar on the Middle-World scale of the stream.
p351
aVAnd similarly, a relativistic computer game,
p352
aVin which objects on the screen manifest the Lorentz contraction, and so on,
p353
aVto try to get ourselves \u2014 to get children into the way of thinking about it.
p354
aa(lp355
VI want to end by applying the idea of Middle World
p356
aVto our perceptions of each other.
p357
aVMost scientists today subscribe to a mechanistic view of the mind:
p358
aVwe're the way we are because our brains are wired up as they are,
p359
aVour hormones are the way they are.
p360
aVWe'd be different, our characters would be different,
p361
aVif our neuro-anatomy and our physiological chemistry were different.
p362
aVBut we scientists are inconsistent.
p363
aVIf we were consistent,
p364
aVour response to a misbehaving person, like a child-murderer,
p365
aVshould be something like:
p366
aVthis unit has a faulty component; it needs repairing.
p367
aVThat's not what we say.
p368
aVWhat we say \u2014 and I include the most austerely mechanistic among us,
p369
aVwhich is probably me \u2014
p370
aVwhat we say is, "Vile monster, prison is too good for you."
p371
aVOr worse, we seek revenge, in all probability thereby triggering
p372
aVthe next phase in an escalating cycle of counter-revenge,
p373
aVwhich we see, of course, all over the world today.
p374
aVIn short, when we're thinking like academics,
p375
aVwe regard people as elaborate and complicated machines,
p376
aVlike computers or cars.
p377
aVBut when we revert to being human,
p378
aVwe behave more like Basil Fawlty, who, we remember,
p379
aVthrashed his car to teach it a lesson,
p380
aVwhen it wouldn't start on "Gourmet Night."
p381
aa(lp382
V(Laughter)
p383
aa(lp384
VThe reason we personify things like cars and computers
p385
aVis that just as monkeys live in an arboreal world
p386
aVand moles live in an underground world
p387
aVand water striders live in a surface tension-dominated flatland,
p388
aVwe live in a social world.
p389
aVWe swim through a sea of people \u2014
p390
aVa social version of Middle World.
p391
aVWe are evolved to second-guess the behavior of others
p392
aVby becoming brilliant, intuitive psychologists.
p393
aVTreating people as machines
p394
aVmay be scientifically and philosophically accurate,
p395
aVbut it's a cumbersome waste of time
p396
aVif you want to guess what this person is going to do next.
p397
aVThe economically useful way to model a person
p398
aVis to treat him as a purposeful, goal-seeking agent
p399
aVwith pleasures and pains, desires and intentions,
p400
aVguilt, blame-worthiness.
p401
aVPersonification and the imputing of intentional purpose
p402
aVis such a brilliantly successful way to model humans,
p403
aVit's hardly surprising the same modeling software
p404
aVoften seizes control when we're trying to think about entities
p405
aVfor which it's not appropriate, like Basil Fawlty with his car
p406
aVor like millions of deluded people, with the universe as a whole.
p407
aa(lp408
V(Laughter)
p409
aa(lp410
VIf the universe is queerer than we can suppose,
p411
aVis it just because we've been naturally selected
p412
aVto suppose only what we needed to suppose
p413
aVin order to survive in the Pleistocene of Africa?
p414
aVOr are our brains so versatile and expandable that we can train ourselves
p415
aVto break out of the box of our evolution?
p416
aVOr finally, are there some things in the universe so queer
p417
aVthat no philosophy of beings, however godlike, could dream them?
