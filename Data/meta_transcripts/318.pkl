VTo be new at TED \u2014 it's like being the last high-school virgin.
p4
aV(Laughter)
p5
aVYou know that all of the cool people are \u2014 they're doing it.
p6
aVAnd you're on the outside, you're at home.
p7
aVYou're like the Raspyni Brothers,
p8
aVwhere you've got your balls in cold water. And \u2014
p9
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p10
aVyou just play with your fingers all day. And then you get invited.
p11
aVAnd you're on the inside, and it's everything you hoped it would be.
p12
aVIt's exciting and there's music playing all of the time
p13
aVand then suddenly it's over. And it's only taken five minutes.
p14
aVAnd you want to go back and do it again.
p15
aVBut I really appreciate being here. And thank you, Chris,
p16
aVand also, thank you, Deborah Patton, for making this possible.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo anyway, today we'll talk about architecture a little bit,
p19
aVwithin the subject of creation and optimism.
p20
aVAnd if you put creation and optimism together,
p21
aVyou've got two choices that you can talk about.
p22
aVYou can talk about creationism \u2014
p23
aVwhich I think wouldn't go down well with this audience,
p24
aVat least not from a view where you were a proponent of it \u2014
p25
aVor you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z.
p26
aVAnd I think that's what I'd like to talk about today.
p27
aVBut any kind of conversation about architecture \u2014
p28
aVwhich is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here,
p29
aVsetting up TED, small-scale architecture \u2014
p30
aVat the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this,
p31
aVthe World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us.
p32
aa(lp33
VBecause if architecture is what I believe it to be,
p34
aVwhich is the built form of our cultural ambitions,
p35
aVwhat do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation
p36
aVthat represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us?
p37
aVAnd our own opportunity to make something new there?
p38
aVThis has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time.
p39
aVI think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way,
p40
aVbrought architecture into focus
p41
aVin a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time,
p42
aVand made it a subject for common conversation.
p43
aVI don't remember, in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture,
p44
aVa time when five people sat me down at a table
p45
aVand asked me very serious questions about zoning, fire exiting,
p46
aVsafety concerns and whether carpet burns.
p47
aVThese are just not things we talked about very often.
p48
aVAnd yet, now, it's talked about all the time.
p49
aVAt the point where you can weaponize your buildings,
p50
aVyou have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way.
p51
aVAnd so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way,
p52
aVwe're going to think about it like this.
p53
aa(lp54
VHow many of you saw USA Today, today? There it is. Looks like that.
p55
aVThere's the World Trade Center site, on the front cover.
p56
aVThey've made a selection.
p57
aVThey've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind,
p58
aVthe enfant terrible of the moment of architecture.
p59
aVChild-prodigy piano player, he started on the squeezebox,
p60
aVand moved to a little more serious issue, a bigger instrument,
p61
aVand now to an even larger instrument,
p62
aVupon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic,
p63
aVas you see here.
p64
aVHe was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition,
p65
aVafter six previous firms struck out
p66
aVwith things that were so stupid and banal
p67
aVthat even the city of New York was forced to go,
p68
aV"Oh, I'm really sorry, we screwed up."
p69
aVRight. Can we do this again from the top,
p70
aVexcept use some people with a vague hint of talent,
p71
aVinstead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time,
p72
aVreal estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities.
p73
aVLet's bring in some real architects for a change.
p74
aVAnd so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Oh, stop clapping.
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VIt's too late. That is gone.
p79
aVThis was a scheme by a team called THINK, a New York-based team,
p80
aVand then there was that one, which was the Libeskind scheme.
p81
aVThis one, this is going to be the new World Trade Center:
p82
aVa giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it.
p83
aVNow, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision,
p84
aVbecause what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction
p85
aVby making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever.
p86
aVBut that's what we're going to do.
p87
aVBut I want you to think about these things
p88
aVin terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents,
p89
aVand that these two things talk about very specifically.
p90
aVAnd that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects,
p91
aVin trying to decide whether we want architecture
p92
aVfrom the kind of technocratic solution to everything \u2014
p93
aVthat there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems,
p94
aVbe they social, be they physical, be they chemical \u2014
p95
aVor something that's more of a romantic solution.
p96
aa(lp97
VNow, I don't mean romantic as in, this is a nice place to take someone on a date.
p98
aVI mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us.
p99
aVSo, in the American tradition,
p100
aVthe difference between the technocratic and the romantic,
p101
aVwould be the difference between Thomas Jefferson's
p102
aVCartesian grids spreading across the United States,
p103
aVthat gives us basically the whole shape
p104
aVof every western state in the United States,
p105
aVas a really, truly, technocratic solution, a bowing to the \u2014
p106
aVin Jefferson's time \u2014 current, popular philosophy of rationalism.
p107
aVOr the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny.
p108
aVNow, which would you rather be? A grid, or manifest destiny?
p109
aVManifest destiny.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VIt's a big deal. It sounds big, it sounds important,
p114
aVit sounds solid. It sounds American. Ballsy, serious, male.
p115
aVAnd that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time.
p116
aVI mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day.
p117
aVWe all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we?
p118
aVEveryone here must own one, or at least they craved one
p119
aVthe moment they saw one.
p120
aVAnd then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key,
p121
aVrather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway,
p122
aVand drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VWhy? Why? Why do you want to do that?
p127
aVWhy do we all want to do that? I even owned a Tudor thing once myself.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VIt's in our nature to go ricocheting
p132
aVback and forth between this technocratic solution
p133
aVand a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are.
p134
aVSo we're going to go straight into this.
p135
aVCan I have the lights off for a moment?
p136
aVI'm going to talk about two architects very, very briefly
p137
aVthat represent the current split, architecturally,
p138
aVbetween these two traditions of a technocratic
p139
aVor technological solution and a romantic solution.
p140
aVAnd these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today.
p141
aVOne very young, one a little more mature.
p142
aVThis is the work of a firm called SHoP,
p143
aVand what you're seeing here, is their isometric drawings
p144
aVof what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park.
p145
aVDoes everybody know what a camera obscura is?
p146
aVYeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses
p147
aVthat takes a picture of the outside world \u2014
p148
aVit's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts \u2014
p149
aVand projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it.
p150
aa(lp151
VThis is just the outline of it, and you can see,
p152
aVdoes it look like a regular building? No.
p153
aVIt's actually non-orthogonal: it's not up and down,
p154
aVsquare, rectangular, anything like that,
p155
aVthat you'd see in a normal shape of a building.
p156
aVThe computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution,
p157
aVhas allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings,
p158
aVtraditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this.
p159
aVWhat's interesting about it is not the shape.
p160
aVWhat's interesting about it is how it's made. How it's made.
p161
aVA brand-new way to put buildings together,
p162
aVsomething called mass customization. No, it is not an oxymoron.
p163
aVWhat makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense,
p164
aVis making individual parts custom, that you can't do over and over again.
p165
aVThat's why we all live in developer houses.
p166
aVThey all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times.
p167
aVThat's because it's cheaper.
p168
aa(lp169
VMass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer,
p170
aVa program that says, manufacture these parts.
p171
aVThe computer then talks to a machine \u2014
p172
aVa computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine \u2014
p173
aVthat can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice,
p174
aVbecause the computer is just a machine.
p175
aVIt doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts.
p176
aVIt doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time.
p177
aVIt's not a laborer \u2014 it's simply an electronic lathe,
p178
aVso the parts can all be cut at the same time.
p179
aVMeanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings,
p180
aVwhich are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life,
p181
aVwhat the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions,
p182
aVlike you used to get when you were a child,
p183
aVwhen you bought little models that said, "Bolt A to B, and C to D."
p184
aVAnd so what the builder will get is every single individual part
p185
aVthat has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck
p186
aVto the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals.
p187
aVJust simple "Bolt A to B" and they will be able to put them together.
p188
aVHere's the little drawing that tells them how that works \u2014
p189
aVand that's what will happen in the end.
p190
aa(lp191
VYou're underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura.
p192
aVLest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance,
p193
aVthese same architects were asked to produce something
p194
aVfor the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York,
p195
aVas part of their young architects summer series.
p196
aVAnd they said, well, it's summer, what do you do?
p197
aVIn the summer, you go to the beach.
p198
aVAnd when you go to the beach, what do you get? You get sand dunes.
p199
aVSo let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana.
p200
aVSo they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune.
p201
aVThey took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program,
p202
aVand that computer program shaped a sand dune
p203
aVand then took that sand dune shape and turned it into \u2014
p204
aVat their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications \u2014
p205
aVa set of instructions for pieces of wood.
p206
aVAnd those are the pieces of wood. Those are the instructions.
p207
aVThese are the pieces, and here's a little of that blown up.
p208
aa(lp209
VWhat you can see is there's about six different colors,
p210
aVand each color represents a type of wood to be cut, a piece of wood to be cut.
p211
aVAll of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck,
p212
aVand hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people,
p213
aVonly one of whom had ever seen the plans before.
p214
aVOnly one of whom had ever seen the plans before.
p215
aVAnd here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard,
p216
aVand there it is fully built.
p217
aVThere are only 16 different pieces of wood,
p218
aVonly 16 different assembly parts here.
p219
aVLooks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside.
p220
aVIt has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool.
p221
aVIt's a great place for parties \u2014 it was, it was only up for six weeks.
p222
aVIt's got little dressing rooms and cabanas,
p223
aVwhere lots of interesting things went on, all summer long.
p224
aa(lp225
VNow, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations,
p226
aVthis is the same firm working at the World Trade Center,
p227
aVreplacing the bridge that used to go across West Street,
p228
aVthat very important pedestrian connection
p229
aVbetween the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side.
p230
aVThey were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks,
p231
aVbuilding it, including all of the parts, manufactured.
p232
aVAnd they were able to do it. That was their design,
p233
aVusing that same computer modeling system
p234
aVand only five or six really different kinds of parts,
p235
aVa couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material
p236
aVand a very simple framing system
p237
aVthat was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck.
p238
aVThey were able to create that.
p239
aVThey were able to create something wonderful.
p240
aVThey're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York,
p241
aVusing the same technology.
p242
aVHere we're going to walk across the bridge at night.
p243
aVIt's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting,
p244
aVso the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face.
p245
aVHere it is going across. And there, down the other side,
p246
aVand you get the same kind of grandeur.
p247
aa(lp248
VNow, let me show you, quickly, the opposite, if I may.
p249
aVWoo, pretty, huh. This is the other side of the coin.
p250
aVThis is the work of David Rockwell from New York City,
p251
aVwhose work you can see out here today.
p252
aVThe current king of the romantics, who approaches his work
p253
aVin a very different fashion.
p254
aVIt's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you
p255
aVinto something that you can do, into something that will please you,
p256
aVsomething that will lift your spirits,
p257
aVsomething that will make you feel as if are in another world \u2014
p258
aVsuch as his Nobu restaurant in New York,
p259
aVwhich is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City
p260
aVto the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition.
p261
aV"When it's all said and done, it's got to look like seaweed," said the owner.
p262
aVOr his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
p263
aa(lp264
VI want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white.
p265
aVEvery single surface of this restaurant is white.
p266
aVThe reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting.
p267
aVIt's all about sensuality. It's all about transforming.
p268
aVWatch this \u2014 I'm not touching any buttons, ladies and gentlemen.
p269
aVThis is happening by itself.
p270
aVIt transforms through the magic of lighting.
p271
aVIt's all about sensuality. It's all about touch.
p272
aVRosa Mexicano restaurant, where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco,
p273
aVup on the Upper West Side,
p274
aVwith this wall of cliff divers who \u2014 there you go, like that.
p275
aVLet's see it one more time.
p276
aVOkay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it.
p277
aVAnd finally, it's about comfort, it's about making you feel good
p278
aVin places that you wouldn't have felt good before.
p279
aVIt's about bringing nature to the inside.
p280
aa(lp281
VIn the Guardian Tower of New York, converted to a W Union Square \u2014
p282
aVI'm sorry I'm rushing \u2014 where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world
p283
aVto make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space
p284
aVof the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself.
p285
aVIt's about stimulation.
p286
aVThis is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste.
p287
aVFizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines,
p288
aVall explained to you by color and texture on the wall.
p289
aVAnd finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters
p290
aVfor the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida,
p291
aVwhere you're asked to enter the Greek theater,
p292
aVlook under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil.
p293
aVAnd I think I'll probably leave it at that. Thank you very much.
