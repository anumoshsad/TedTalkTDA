p7
aa(lp8
V(French) Mais quand tu es fâché avec quelqu'un
p9
aVc'est pas passé the first time.
p10
aa(lp11
V(British English) And that's one of the things that I enjoy most
p12
aVabout this convention.
p13
aVIt's not so much, as so little has to do with what everything is.
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VBut it is within our self-interest
p18
aVto understand the topography of our lives
p19
aVunto ourselves.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VThe future states that there is no time
p24
aVother than the collapsation of that sensation
p25
aVof the mirror of the memories in which we are living.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VCommon knowledge,
p30
aVbut important nonetheless.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VAs we face fear in these times,
p35
aVand fear is all around us,
p36
aVwe also have anti-fear.
p37
aVIt's hard to imagine or measure.
p38
aVThe background radiation is simply too static
p39
aVto be able to be seen under the normal spectral analysis.
p40
aa(lp41
V(American accent) But we feel as though there are times
p42
aVwhen a lot of us \u2014 you know what I'm saying?
p43
aVBut \u2014 you know what I'm saying?
p44
aVBecause, as a hip hop thing, you know what I'm saying,
p45
aVTED be rocking \u2014 you know what I'm saying.
p46
aVLike so I wrote a song,
p47
aVand I hope you guys dig it.
p48
aVIt's a song about people
p49
aVand sasquatches \u2014
p50
aa(lp51
V(Laughter)
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd other French science stuff.
p54
aVThat's French science.
p55
aVOkay, here we go.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Singing) I've been trying inside
p58
aVI know that I'm in trouble
p59
aa(lp60
V(Applause)
p61
aa(lp62
Vthat I'm in trouble
p63
aVby myself
p64
aVBut every time it gets me
p65
aa(lp66
V(Vocalization)
p67
aa(lp68
V(Beatbox)
p69
aa(lp70
V(Singing) And I've been trying to be the one that you believe in
p71
aVAnd you're the one that I want to be so saucy
p72
aVAnd you're the one I want to [unclear], baby
p73
aVAnd you can do anything
p74
aVas long as you don't get hurt along the way back
p75
aa(lp76
V(Beatbox)
p77
aa(lp78
VIf I survive, I'm going to tell you what is wrong
p79
aVBecause if you were [unclear]
p80
aVAnd I think that you're looking like a [unclear]
p81
aVI give you what I want to be
p82
aa(lp83
V(Music)
p84
aa(lp85
V(Music ends abruptly)
p86
aa(lp87
V(British accent) And it's like,
p88
aVyou could use as many of those things that you want.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Applause)
p91
aVAnd the computer models,
p92
aVno matter how many that you have
p93
aVand how many people that you use,
p94
aVare never going to be able to arrive at the same conclusions.
p95
aVFour years ago I worked with a few people at the Brookings Institute,
p96
aVand I arrived at a conclusion.
p97
aa(lp98
V(Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
VTomorrow is another day.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VNot just any day,
p105
aVbut it is a day.
p106
aVIt will get here, there's no question.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd the important thing to remember
p109
aVis that this simulation is a good one.
p110
aVIt's believable, it's tactile.
p111
aVYou can reach out \u2014 things are solid.
p112
aVYou can move objects from one area to another.
p113
aVYou can feel your body.
p114
aVYou can say, "I'd like to go over to this location,"
p115
aVand you can move this mass of molecules through the air
p116
aVover to another location, at will.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
VThat's something you live inside of every day.
p121
aVNow with the allocation and the understanding
p122
aVof the lack of understanding,
p123
aVwe enter into a new era of science
p124
aVin which we feel nothing more
p125
aVthan so much so as to say
p126
aVthat those within themselves,
p127
aVcomporary or non-comporary,
p128
aVwill figuratively figure
p129
aVinto the folding of our non-understanding
p130
aVand our partial understanding
p131
aVto the networks of which we all draw our source
p132
aVand conclusions from.
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VSo, as I say before the last piece,
p137
aVfeel not as though it is a sphere we live on,
p138
aVrather an infinite plane which has the illusion
p139
aVof leading yourself back to the point of origin.
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VOnce we understand that all the spheres in the sky
p144
aVare just large infinite planes,
p145
aVit will be plain to see.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
V(Audience) (Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VThis is my final piece.
p152
aVAnd just remember,
p153
aVeverything you are \u2014
p154
aVit's more important to realize the negative space,
p155
aVas music is only the division of space;
p156
aVit is the space we are listening to divided as such,
p157
aVwhich gives us the information in comparison to something other
p158
aVthat gives us the idea of what the idea that wants to be transmitted
p159
aVwants to be.
p160
aVSo please, without further ado.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Applause)
p163
aa(lp164
VThank you.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Applause)
p167
aa(lp168
VThis is a fun one.
p169
aVIt goes like this.

V(Music ends)
p176
aa(lp177
VOkay, for the last piece I'd like to do,
p178
aVthis one goes very similar to this.
p179
aVI hope you guys recognize it.
p180
aVHere we go.
p181
aVOkay, that still works. Okay, good.
p182
aVAll right, here we go.
p183
aa(lp184

p185
aa(lp186
V(Beatbox)
