VI would like to demonstrate for the first time in public
p4
aVthat it is possible to transmit a video
p5
aVfrom a standard off-the-shelf LED lamp
p6
aVto a solar cell with a laptop acting as a receiver.
p7
aVThere is no Wi-Fi involved, it's just light.
p8
aa(lp9
VAnd you may wonder, what's the point?
p10
aVAnd the point is this:
p11
aVThere will be a massive extension of the Internet
p12
aVto close the digital divide,
p13
aVand also to allow for what we call "The Internet of Things" \u2014
p14
aVtens of billions of devices connected to the Internet.
p15
aa(lp16
VIn my view, such an extension of the Internet can only work
p17
aVif it's almost energy-neutral.
p18
aVThis means we need to use existing infrastructure as much as possible.
p19
aVAnd this is where the solar cell and the LED come in.
p20
aa(lp21
VI demonstrated for the first time,
p22
aVat TED in 2011,
p23
aVLi-Fi, or Light Fidelity.
p24
aVLi-Fi uses off-the-shelf LEDs to transmit data incredibly fast,
p25
aVand also in a safe and secure manner.
p26
aVData is transported by the light,
p27
aVencoded in subtle changes of the brightness.
p28
aVIf we look around, we have many LEDs around us,
p29
aVso there's a rich infrastructure of Li-Fi transmitters around us.
p30
aVBut so far, we have been using special devices \u2014 small photo detectors,
p31
aVto receive the information encoded in the data.
p32
aVI wanted to find a way to also use existing infrastructure
p33
aVto receive data from our Li-Fi lights.
p34
aVAnd this is why I have been looking into solar cells and solar panels.
p35
aa(lp36
VA solar cell absorbs light and converts it into electrical energy.
p37
aVThis is why we can use a solar cell to charge our mobile phone.
p38
aVBut now we need to remember
p39
aVthat the data is encoded in subtle changes of the brightness of the LED,
p40
aVso if the incoming light fluctuates,
p41
aVso does the energy harvested from the solar cell.
p42
aVThis means we have a principal mechanism in place
p43
aVto receive information from the light and by the solar cell,
p44
aVbecause the fluctuations of the energy harvested
p45
aVcorrespond to the data transmitted.
p46
aa(lp47
VOf course the question is:
p48
aVcan we receive very fast and subtle changes of the brightness,
p49
aVsuch as the ones transmitted by our LED lights?
p50
aVAnd the answer to that is yes, we can.
p51
aVWe have shown in the lab
p52
aVthat we can receive up to 50 megabytes per second
p53
aVfrom a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell.
p54
aVAnd this is faster than most broadband connections these days.
p55
aa(lp56
VNow let me show you in practice.
p57
aVIn this box is a standard, off-the-shelf LED lamp.
p58
aVThis is a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell;
p59
aVit is connected to the laptop.
p60
aVAnd also we have an instrument here
p61
aVto visualize the energy we harvest from the solar cell.
p62
aVAnd this instrument shows something at the moment.
p63
aVThis is because the solar cell already harvests light from the ambient light.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow what I would like to do first is switch on the light,
p66
aVand I'll simply, only switch on the light,
p67
aVfor a moment,
p68
aVand what you'll notice is that the instrument jumps to the right.
p69
aVSo the solar cell, for a moment,
p70
aVis harvesting energy from this artificial light source.
p71
aVIf I turn it off, we see it drops.
p72
aVI turn it on ...
p73
aVSo we harvest energy with the solar cell.
p74
aa(lp75
VBut next I would like to activate the streaming of the video.
p76
aVAnd I've done this by pressing this button.
p77
aVSo now this LED lamp here is streaming a video
p78
aVby changing the brightness of the LED in a very subtle way,
p79
aVand in a way that you can't recognize with your eye,
p80
aVbecause the changes are too fast to recognize.
p81
aVBut in order to prove the point,
p82
aVI can block the light of the solar cell.
p83
aVSo first you notice the energy harvesting drops
p84
aVand the video stops as well.
p85
aVIf I remove the blockage, the video will restart.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Applause)
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd I can repeat that.
p90
aVSo we stop the transmission of the video and energy harvesting stops as well.
p91
aVSo that is to show that the solar cell acts as a receiver.
p92
aa(lp93
VBut now imagine that this LED lamp is a street light, and there's fog.
p94
aVAnd so I want to simulate fog,
p95
aVand that's why I brought a handkerchief with me.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd let me put the handkerchief over the solar cell.
p100
aVFirst you notice
p101
aVthe energy harvested drops, as expected,
p102
aVbut now the video still continues.
p103
aVThis means, despite the blockage,
p104
aVthere's sufficient light coming through the handkerchief to the solar cell,
p105
aVso that the solar cell is able to decode and stream that information,
p106
aVin this case, a high-definition video.
p107
aa(lp108
VWhat's really important here is that a solar cell has become a receiver
p109
aVfor high-speed wireless signals encoded in light,
p110
aVwhile it maintains its primary function as an energy-harvesting device.
p111
aVThat's why it is possible
p112
aVto use existing solar cells on the roof of a hut
p113
aVto act as a broadband receiver
p114
aVfrom a laser station on a close by hill, or indeed, lamp post.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd It really doesn't matter where the beam hits the solar cell.
p117
aVAnd the same is true
p118
aVfor translucent solar cells integrated into windows,
p119
aVsolar cells integrated into street furniture,
p120
aVor indeed, solar cells integrated into these billions of devices
p121
aVthat will form the Internet of Things.
p122
aVBecause simply,
p123
aVwe don't want to charge these devices regularly,
p124
aVor worse, replace the batteries every few months.
p125
aa(lp126
VAs I said to you,
p127
aVthis is the first time I've shown this in public.
p128
aVIt's very much a lab demonstration,
p129
aVa prototype.
p130
aVBut my team and I are confident that we can take this to market
p131
aVwithin the next two to three years.
p132
aVAnd we hope we will be able to contribute to closing the digital divide,
p133
aVand also contribute
p134
aVto connecting all these billions of devices to the Internet.
p135
aVAnd all of this without causing
p136
aVa massive explosion of energy consumption \u2014
p137
aVbecause of the solar cells, quite the opposite.
p138
