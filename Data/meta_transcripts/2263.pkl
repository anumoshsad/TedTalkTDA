VThe FBI is responsible for more terrorism plots
p4
aVin the United States
p5
aVthan any other organization.
p6
aVMore than al Qaeda,
p7
aVmore than al Shabaab,
p8
aVmore than the Islamic State,
p9
aVmore than all of them combined.
p10
aa(lp11
VThis isn't likely how you think about the FBI.
p12
aVYou probably think of FBI agents gunning down bad guys like John Dillinger,
p13
aVor arresting corrupt politicians.
p14
aa(lp15
VAfter the 9/11 terrorist attacks,
p16
aVthe FBI became less concerned
p17
aVwith gangsters and  crooked elected officials.
p18
aVThe new target became terrorists,
p19
aVand the pursuit of terrorists  has consumed the FBI.
p20
aa(lp21
VEvery year, the Bureau spends 3.3 billion dollars
p22
aVon domestic counterterrorism activities.
p23
aVCompare than to just 2.6 billion dollars combined for organized crime,
p24
aVfinancial fraud, public corruption
p25
aVand all other types of traditional criminal activity.
p26
aa(lp27
VI've spent years pouring through the case files
p28
aVof terrorism prosecutions in  the United States,
p29
aVand I've come to  the conclusion that the FBI
p30
aVis much better at creating terrorists than it is at catching terrorists.
p31
aa(lp32
VIn the 14 years since 9/11,
p33
aVyou can count about six real  terrorist attacks in the United States.
p34
aVThese include the Boston Marathon  bombings in 2013,
p35
aVas well as failed attacks,
p36
aVsuch as the time when  a man named Faisal Shahzad
p37
aVtried to deliver a car bomb to Times Square.
p38
aVIn those same 14 years,
p39
aVthe Bureau, however, has bragged
p40
aVabout how it's foiled dozens of terrorism plots.
p41
aVIn all, the FBI has arrested more than 175 people
p42
aVin aggressive, undercover  conterterrorism stings.
p43
aa(lp44
VThese operations, which are usually led by an informant,
p45
aVprovide the means and opportunity,
p46
aVand sometimes even the idea,
p47
aVfor mentally ill and  economically desperate people
p48
aVto become what we now term terrorists.
p49
aa(lp50
VAfter 9/11, the FBI was given an edict:
p51
aVnever again.
p52
aVNever another attack on American soil.
p53
aVFBI agents were told to find terrorists before they struck.
p54
aVTo do this, agents recruited a network of more than 15,000 informants nationwide,
p55
aVall looking for anyone who  might be dangerous.
p56
aVAn informant can earn  100,000 dollars or more
p57
aVfor every terrorism case  they bring to the FBI.
p58
aVThat's right, the FBI is paying mostly criminals and con men
p59
aVsix figures to spy on communities in the United States,
p60
aVbut mostly Muslim American communities.
p61
aa(lp62
VThese informants nab people like  Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif
p63
aVand Walli Mujahidh.
p64
aVBoth are mentally ill.
p65
aVAbdul-Latif had a history of huffing gasoline and attempting suicide.
p66
aVMujahidh had schizoaffective disorder,
p67
aVhe had trouble distinguishing between reality and fantasy.
p68
aVIn 2012, the FBI arrested these two men
p69
aVfor conspiring to attack a military recruiting station outside Seattle
p70
aVwith weapons provided,  of course, by the FBI.
p71
aVThe FBI's informant was Robert Childs,
p72
aVa convicted rapist and child molester
p73
aVwho was paid 90,000 dollars  for his work on the case.
p74
aVThis isn't an outlier.
p75
aa(lp76
VIn 2009, an FBI informant who had fled Pakistan on murder charges
p77
aVled four men in a plot to bomb  synagogues in the Bronx.
p78
aVThe lead defendant was James Cromitie,
p79
aVa broke Walmart employee with a history of mental problems.
p80
aVAnd the informant had offered  him 250,000 dollars
p81
aVif he participated in that plot.
p82
aVThere are many more examples.
p83
aa(lp84
VToday, The Intercept published my new story
p85
aVabout a counterterrorism sting in Tampa involving Sami Osmakac,
p86
aVa young man who was living  near Tampa, Florida.
p87
aVOsmakac also had  schizoaffective disorder.
p88
aVHe too was broke,
p89
aVand he had no connections to  international terrorist groups.
p90
aVNonetheless,
p91
aVan FBI informant gave him a job, handed him money,
p92
aVintroduced him to an undercover agent posing as a terrorist,
p93
aVand lured him in a plot to bomb an Irish bar.
p94
aa(lp95
VBut here's what's interesting:
p96
aVThe lead undercover agent \u2014
p97
aVyou can see him in this picture with his face blurred \u2014
p98
aVwould go back to the Tampa field office with his recording equipment on.
p99
aVBehind closed doors,
p100
aVFBI agents admitted that what they were doing was farcical.
p101
aVA federal judge doesn't want you to hear about these conversations.
p102
aVHe sealed the transcripts and placed them under a protective order
p103
aVin an attempt to prevent someone like me from doing something like this.
p104
aVBehind closed doors, the lead agent,
p105
aVthe squad supervisor,
p106
aVdescribed their would-be terrorist
p107
aVas a "retarded fool who didn't have a pot to piss in."
p108
aVThey described his terrorist ambitions
p109
aVas wishy-washy and a pipe dream scenario.
p110
aa(lp111
VBut that didn't stop the FBI.
p112
aVThey provided Sami Osmakac  everything he needed.
p113
aVThey gave him a car bomb, they gave him an AK-47,
p114
aVthey helped him make a so-called martyrdom video,
p115
aVand they even gave  him money for a taxi cab
p116
aVso that he could get to where they wanted him to go.
p117
aVAs they were working the sting,
p118
aVthe squad supervisor tells his agents he wanted a Hollywood ending.
p119
aVAnd he got a Hollywood ending.
p120
aVWhen Sami Osmakac attempted to deliver what he thought
p121
aVwas a car bomb,
p122
aVhe was arrested, convicted and  sentenced to 40 years in prison.
p123
aa(lp124
VSami Osmakac isn't alone.
p125
aVHe's one of more than  175 so-called terrorists,
p126
aVfor whom the FBI has created  Hollywood endings.
p127
aVU.S. government officials call this the War on Terror.
p128
aVIt's really just theater,
p129
aVa national security theater,
p130
aVwith mentally ill men like Sami Osmakac
p131
aVunwitting actors in a  carefully choreographed production
p132
aVbrought to you by the FBI.
p133
aa(lp134
VThank you.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Applause)
p137
aa(lp138
VTom Rielly: So, those are some pretty strong accusations,
p139
aVpretty strong charges.
p140
aVHow can you back this up?
p141
aa(lp142
VTrevor Aaronson: My research began in 2010
p143
aVwhen I received a grant from the  Investigative Reporting Program
p144
aVat U.C. Berkeley,
p145
aVand a research assistant and I
p146
aVput together a database of all terrorism prosecutions
p147
aVat the time during  the first decade after 9/11.
p148
aVAnd we used the court file to find out whether
p149
aVthe defendants had any connections to international terrorist groups,
p150
aVwhether an informant was used,
p151
aVand whether the informant played the role of an agent provocateur
p152
aVby providing the means and opportunity.
p153
aVAnd we submitted that to the FBI
p154
aVand we asked them to respond to our database.
p155
aVIf they believed there were any errors,
p156
aVwe asked them to tell us what they were and we'd go back and check
p157
aVand they never challenged any of our findings.
p158
aVLater, I used that data  in a magazine article
p159
aVand later in my book,
p160
aVand on appearances on places like CBS and NPR,
p161
aVthey were offered that opportunity again
p162
aVto say, "Trevor Aaronson's  findings are wrong."
p163
aVAnd they've never come forward and said,
p164
aV"These are the problems with those findings."
p165
aVSo the data has since been used  by groups like Human Rights Watch
p166
aVon its recent report on  these types of sting operations.
p167
aVAnd so far, the FBI has never  really responded
p168
aVto these charges that it's really not catching terrorists
p169
aVso much as it's catching mentally ill people
p170
aVthat it can dress up as terrorists  in these types of sting operations.
p171
aa(lp172
VTR: So The Intercept is that new investigative journalism website,
p173
aVthat's cofounded by Glenn Greenwald.
p174
aVTell us about your article  and why there.
p175
aa(lp176
VTA: The Intercept seemed to be the most logical place for this
p177
aVbecause my article is  really leveraging the fact that
p178
aVa source had leaked to me transcripts of these
p179
aVprivate FBI conversations that a federal judge had sealed
p180
aVbased on the government's claim  that their release
p181
aVwould irreparably damage  the U.S. government's
p182
aVlaw enforcement strategy.
p183
aVSo a place like The Intercept was set up to protect journalists
p184
aVand publish their work
p185
aVwhen they're dealing with  very sensitive matters like this.
p186
aVSo my story in The Intercept,  which was just published today,
p187
aVtells the story of how Sami Osmakac was set up in this FBI sting
p188
aVand goes into much greater detail.
p189
aVIn this talk, I could only highlight the things that they said,
p190
aVsuch as calling him a "retarded fool."
p191
aVBut it was much more elaborate,
p192
aVthey went to great lengths to put money in Sami Osmakac's hands,
p193
aVwhich he then used to purchase weapons from the undercover agent.
p194
aVWhen he went to trial,
p195
aVthe central piece of evidence  was that he paid for these weapons,
p196
aVwhen in truth, these transcripts show how the FBI orchestrated
p197
aVsomeone who was essentially mentally ill and broke
p198
aVto get money to then  pay for weapons
p199
aVthat they could then charge him in a conspiracy for.
p200
aa(lp201
VTR: One final question.
p202
aVLess than 10 days ago,
p203
aVthe FBI arrested some potential  ISIS suspects in Brooklyn,
p204
aVsaying that they might be headed to Syria,
p205
aVand were those real, or examples of more of the same?
p206
aa(lp207
VTA: Well so far, we only know what's come out in the court file,
p208
aVbut they seem to suggest it's another example of the same.
p209
aVThese types of sting operations  have moved from flavor to flavor.
p210
aVSo initially it was al Qaeda plots,
p211
aVand now the Islamic State is the current flavor.
p212
aVWhat's worth noting about that case is that the three men that were charged
p213
aVonly began the plot to go to Syria
p214
aVafter the introduction of the FBI informant,
p215
aVand in fact, the FBI informant had helped them with the travel documents
p216
aVthat they needed.
p217
aVIn kind of a comical turn  in that particular case,
p218
aVone of the defendant's mother had found out
p219
aVthat he was interested in going to Syria and had hid his passport.
p220
aVSo it's unclear that even if he had showed up at the airport,
p221
aVthat he ever could have gone anywhere.
p222
aVSo yes, there are people who might be interested in joining the Islamic State
p223
aVin the United States,
p224
aVand those are people that the United  States government should be looking at
p225
aVto see if they're interested in violence here.
p226
aVIn this particular case, given the evidence that's so far come out,
p227
aVit suggests the FBI made it possible for these guys
p228
aVto move along in a plan to go to Syria
p229
aVwhen they were never close  to that in the first place.
p230
aa(lp231
VTR: Thanks a lot, that's amazing. TA: Thank you.
