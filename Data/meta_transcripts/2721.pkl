VSo it all came to life
p4
aVin a dark bar in Madrid.
p5
aVI encountered my colleague from McGill, Michael Meaney.
p6
aVAnd we were drinking a few beers,
p7
aVand like scientists do,
p8
aVhe told me about his work.
p9
aVAnd he told me that he is interested in how mother rats lick their pups
p10
aVafter they were born.
p11
aVAnd I was sitting there and saying,
p12
aV"This is where my tax dollars are wasted \u2014
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
Von this kind of soft science."
p17
aa(lp18
VAnd he started telling me
p19
aVthat the rats, like humans,
p20
aVlick their pups in very different ways.
p21
aVSome mothers do a lot of that,
p22
aVsome mothers do very little,
p23
aVand most are in between.
p24
aVBut what's interesting about it
p25
aVis when he follows these pups when they become adults \u2014
p26
aVlike, years in human life, long after their mother died.
p27
aVThey are completely different animals.
p28
aVThe animals that were licked and groomed heavily,
p29
aVthe high-licking and grooming,
p30
aVare not stressed.
p31
aVThey have different sexual behavior.
p32
aVThey have a different way of living
p33
aVthan those that were not treated as intensively by their mothers.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo then I was thinking to myself:
p36
aVIs this magic?
p37
aVHow does this work?
p38
aVAs geneticists would like you to think,
p39
aVperhaps the mother had the "bad mother" gene
p40
aVthat caused her pups to be stressful,
p41
aVand then it was passed from generation to generation;
p42
aVit's all determined by genetics.
p43
aVOr is it possible that something else is going on here?
p44
aa(lp45
VIn rats, we can ask this question and answer it.
p46
aVSo what we did is a cross-fostering experiment.
p47
aVYou essentially separate the litter, the babies of this rat, at birth,
p48
aVto two kinds of fostering mothers \u2014
p49
aVnot the real mothers, but mothers that will take care of them:
p50
aVhigh-licking mothers and low-licking mothers.
p51
aVAnd you can do the opposite with the low-licking pups.
p52
aVAnd the remarkable answer was,
p53
aVit wasn't important what gene you got from your mother.
p54
aVIt was not the biological mother that defined this property of these rats.
p55
aVIt is the mother that took care of the pups.
p56
aVSo how can this work?
p57
aa(lp58
VI am an a epigeneticist.
p59
aVI am interested in how genes are marked
p60
aVby a chemical mark
p61
aVduring embryogenesis, during the time we're in the womb of our mothers,
p62
aVand decide which gene will be expressed
p63
aVin what tissue.
p64
aVDifferent genes are expressed in the brain than in the liver and the eye.
p65
aVAnd we thought: Is it possible
p66
aVthat the mother is somehow reprogramming the gene of her offspring
p67
aVthrough her behavior?
p68
aVAnd we spent 10 years,
p69
aVand we found that there is a cascade of biochemical events
p70
aVby which the licking and grooming of the mother, the care of the mother,
p71
aVis translated to biochemical signals
p72
aVthat go into the nucleus and into the DNA
p73
aVand program it differently.
p74
aVSo now the animal can prepare itself for life:
p75
aVIs life going to be harsh?
p76
aVIs there going to be a lot of food?
p77
aVAre there going to be a lot of cats and snakes around,
p78
aVor will I live in an upper-class neighborhood
p79
aVwhere all I have to do is behave well and proper,
p80
aVand that will gain me social acceptance?
p81
aVAnd now one can think about how important that process can be
p82
aVfor our lives.
p83
aa(lp84
VWe inherit our DNA from our ancestors.
p85
aVThe DNA is old.
p86
aVIt evolved during evolution.
p87
aVBut it doesn't tell us if you are going to be born in Stockholm,
p88
aVwhere the days are long in the summer and short in the winter,
p89
aVor in Ecuador,
p90
aVwhere there's an equal number of hours for day and night all year round.
p91
aVAnd that has such an enormous [effect] on our physiology.
p92
aVSo what we suggest is, perhaps what happens early in life,
p93
aVthose signals that come through the mother,
p94
aVtell the child what kind of social world you're going to be living in.
p95
aVIt will be harsh, and you'd better be anxious and be stressful,
p96
aVor it's going to be an easy world, and you have to be different.
p97
aVIs it going to be a world with a lot of light or little light?
p98
aVIs it going to be a world with a lot of food or little food?
p99
aVIf there's no food around,
p100
aVyou'd better develop your brain to binge whenever you see a meal,
p101
aVor store every piece of food that you have as fat.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo this is good.
p104
aVEvolution has selected this
p105
aVto allow our fixed, old DNA to function in a dynamic way
p106
aVin new environments.
p107
aVBut sometimes things can go wrong;
p108
aVfor example, if you're born to a poor family
p109
aVand the signals are, "You better binge,
p110
aVyou better eat every piece of food you're going to encounter."
p111
aVBut now we humans and our brain have evolved,
p112
aVhave changed evolution even faster.
p113
aVNow you can buy McDonald's for one dollar.
p114
aVAnd therefore, the preparation that we had by our mothers
p115
aVis turning out to be maladaptive.
p116
aVThe same preparation that was supposed to protect us from hunger and famine
p117
aVis going to cause obesity,
p118
aVcardiovascular problems and metabolic disease.
p119
aVSo this concept that genes could be marked by our experience,
p120
aVand especially the early life experience,
p121
aVcan provide us a unifying explanation
p122
aVof both health and disease.
p123
aa(lp124
VBut is true only for rats?
p125
aVThe problem is, we cannot test this in humans,
p126
aVbecause ethically, we cannot administer child adversity in a random way.
p127
aVSo if a poor child develops a certain property,
p128
aVwe don't know whether this is caused by poverty
p129
aVor whether poor people have bad genes.
p130
aVSo geneticists will try to tell you that poor people are poor
p131
aVbecause their genes make them poor.
p132
aVEpigeneticists will tell you
p133
aVpoor people are in a bad environment or an impoverished environment
p134
aVthat creates that phenotype, that property.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo we moved to look into our cousins, the monkeys.
p137
aVMy colleague, Stephen Suomi, has been rearing monkeys
p138
aVin two different ways:
p139
aVrandomly separated the monkey from the mother
p140
aVand reared her with a nurse
p141
aVand surrogate motherhood conditions.
p142
aVSo these monkeys didn't have a mother; they had a nurse.
p143
aVAnd other monkeys were reared with their normal, natural mothers.
p144
aVAnd when they were old, they were completely different animals.
p145
aVThe monkeys that had a mother did not care about alcohol,
p146
aVthey were not sexually aggressive.
p147
aVThe monkeys that didn't have a mother were aggressive, were stressed
p148
aVand were alcoholics.
p149
aVSo we looked at their DNA early after birth, to see:
p150
aVIs it possible that the mother is marking?
p151
aVIs there a signature of the mother in the DNA of the offspring?
p152
aa(lp153
VThese are Day-14 monkeys,
p154
aVand what you see here is the modern way by which we study epigenetics.
p155
aVWe can now map those chemical marks, which we call methylation marks,
p156
aVon DNA at a single nucleotide resolution.
p157
aVWe can map the entire genome.
p158
aVWe can now compare the monkey that had a mother or not.
p159
aVAnd here's a visual presentation of this.
p160
aVWhat you see is the genes that got more methylated are red.
p161
aVThe genes that got less methylated are green.
p162
aVYou can see many genes are changing,
p163
aVbecause not having a mother is not just one thing \u2014
p164
aVit affects the whole way;
p165
aVit sends signals about the whole way your world is going to look
p166
aVwhen you become an adult.
p167
aVAnd you can see the two groups of monkeys
p168
aVextremely well-separated from each other.
p169
aVHow early does this develop?
p170
aVThese monkeys already didn't see their mothers,
p171
aVso they had a social experience.
p172
aVDo we sense our social status, even at the moment of birth?
p173
aa(lp174
VSo in this experiment, we took placentas of monkeys
p175
aVthat had different social status.
p176
aVWhat's interesting about social rank is that across all living beings,
p177
aVthey will structure themselves by hierarchy.
p178
aVMonkey number one is the boss;
p179
aVmonkey number four is the peon.
p180
aVYou put four monkeys in a cage,
p181
aVthere will always be a boss and always be a peon.
p182
aVAnd what's interesting is that the monkey number one
p183
aVis much healthier than monkey number four.
p184
aVAnd if you put them in a cage,
p185
aVmonkey number one will not eat as much.
p186
aVMonkey number four will eat [a lot].
p187
aVAnd what you see here in this methylation mapping,
p188
aVa dramatic separation at birth
p189
aVof the animals that had a high social status
p190
aVversus the animals that did not have a high status.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo we are born already knowing the social information,
p193
aVand that social information is not bad or good,
p194
aVit just prepares us for life,
p195
aVbecause we have to program our biology differently
p196
aVif we are in the high or the low social status.
p197
aa(lp198
VBut how can you study this in humans?
p199
aVWe can't do experiments, we can't administer adversity to humans.
p200
aVBut God does experiments with humans,
p201
aVand it's called natural disasters.
p202
aa(lp203
VOne of the hardest natural disasters in Canadian history
p204
aVhappened in my province of Quebec.
p205
aVIt's the ice storm of 1998.
p206
aVWe lost our entire electrical grid because of an ice storm
p207
aVwhen the temperatures were, in the dead of winter in Quebec,
p208
aVminus 20 to minus 30.
p209
aVAnd there were pregnant mothers during that time.
p210
aVAnd my colleague Suzanne King followed the children of these mothers
p211
aVfor 15 years.
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd what happened was, that as the stress increased \u2014
p214
aVand here we had objective measures of stress:
p215
aVHow long were you without power? Where did you spend your time?
p216
aVWas it in your mother-in-law's apartment or in some posh country home?
p217
aVSo all of these added up to a social stress scale,
p218
aVand you can ask the question:
p219
aVHow did the children look?
p220
aVAnd it appears that as stress increases,
p221
aVthe children develop more autism,
p222
aVthey develop more metabolic diseases
p223
aVand they develop more autoimmune diseases.
p224
aVWe would map the methylation state,
p225
aVand again, you see the green genes becoming red as stress increases,
p226
aVthe red genes becoming green as stress increases,
p227
aVan entire rearrangement of the genome in response to stress.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo if we can program genes,
p230
aVif we are not just the slaves of the history of our genes,
p231
aVthat they could be programmed, can we deprogram them?
p232
aVBecause epigenetic causes can cause diseases like cancer,
p233
aVmetabolic disease
p234
aVand mental health diseases.
p235
aa(lp236
VLet's talk about cocaine addiction.
p237
aVCocaine addiction is a terrible situation
p238
aVthat can lead to death and to loss of human life.
p239
aVWe asked the question:
p240
aVCan we reprogram the addicted brain
p241
aVto make that animal not addicted anymore?
p242
aVWe used a cocaine addiction model
p243
aVthat recapitulates what happens in humans.
p244
aVIn humans, you're in high school,
p245
aVsome friends suggest you use some cocaine,
p246
aVyou take cocaine, nothing happens.
p247
aVMonths pass by, something reminds you of what happened the first time,
p248
aVa pusher pushes cocaine,
p249
aVand you become addicted and your life has changed.
p250
aa(lp251
VIn rats, we do the same thing.
p252
aVMy colleague, Gal Yadid,
p253
aVhe trains the animals to get used to cocaine,
p254
aVthen for one month, no cocaine.
p255
aVThen he reminds them of the party when they saw the cocaine the first time
p256
aVby cue, the colors of the cage when they saw cocaine.
p257
aVAnd they go crazy.
p258
aVThey will press the lever to get cocaine
p259
aVuntil they die.
p260
aVWe first determined that the difference between these animals
p261
aVis that during that time when nothing happens,
p262
aVthere's no cocaine around,
p263
aVtheir epigenome is rearranged.
p264
aVTheir genes are re-marked in a different way,
p265
aVand when the cue comes, their genome is ready
p266
aVto develop this addictive phenotype.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo we treated these animals with drugs that either increase DNA methylation,
p269
aVwhich was the epigenetic marker to look at,
p270
aVor decrease epigenetic markings.
p271
aVAnd we found that if we increased methylation,
p272
aVthese animals go even crazier.
p273
aVThey become more craving for cocaine.
p274
aVBut if we reduce the DNA methylation,
p275
aVthe animals are not addicted anymore.
p276
aVWe have reprogrammed them.
p277
aVAnd a fundamental difference between an epigenetic drug
p278
aVand any other drug
p279
aVis that with epigenetic drugs,
p280
aVwe essentially remove the signs of experience,
p281
aVand once they're gone,
p282
aVthey will not come back unless you have the same experience.
p283
aVThe animal now is reprogrammed.
p284
aVSo when we visited the animals 30 days, 60 days later,
p285
aVwhich is in human terms many years of life,
p286
aVthey were still not addicted \u2014 by a single epigenetic treatment.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo what did we learn about DNA?
p289
aVDNA is not just a sequence of letters;
p290
aVit's not just a script.
p291
aVDNA is a dynamic movie.
p292
aVOur experiences are being written into this movie, which is interactive.
p293
aVYou're, like, watching a movie of your life, with the DNA,
p294
aVwith your remote control.
p295
aVYou can remove an actor and add an actor.
p296
aVAnd so you have, in spite of the deterministic nature of genetics,
p297
aVyou have control of the way your genes look,
p298
aVand this has a tremendous optimistic message
p299
aVfor the ability to now encounter some of the deadly diseases
p300
aVlike cancer, mental health,
p301
aVwith a new approach,
p302
aVlooking at them as maladaptation.
p303
aVAnd if we can epigenetically intervene,
p304
aV[we can] reverse the movie by removing an actor
p305
aVand setting up a new narrative.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo what I told you today is,
p308
aVour DNA is really combined of two components,
p309
aVtwo layers of information.
p310
aVOne layer of information is old,
p311
aVevolved from millions of years of evolution.
p312
aVIt is fixed and very hard to change.
p313
aVThe other layer of information is the epigenetic layer,
p314
aVwhich is open and dynamic
p315
aVand sets up a narrative that is interactive,
p316
aVthat allows us to control, to a large extent, our destiny,
p317
aVto help the destiny of our children
p318
aVand to hopefully conquer disease
p319
aVand serious health challenges
p320
aVthat have plagued humankind for a long time.
p321
aa(lp322
VSo even though we are determined
p323
aVby our genes,
p324
aVwe have a degree of freedom
p325
aVthat can set up our life to a life of responsibility.
p326
