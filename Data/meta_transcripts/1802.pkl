VMotor racing is a funny old business.
p4
aVWe make a new car every year,
p5
aVand then we spend the rest of the season
p6
aVtrying to understand what it is we've built
p7
aVto make it better, to make it faster.
p8
aVAnd then the next year, we start again.
p9
aVNow, the car you see in front of you is quite complicated.
p10
aVThe chassis is made up of about 11,000 components,
p11
aVthe engine another 6,000,
p12
aVthe electronics about eight and a half thousand.
p13
aVSo there's about 25,000 things there that can go wrong.
p14
aVSo motor racing is very much about attention to detail.
p15
aVThe other thing about Formula 1 in particular
p16
aVis we're always changing the car.
p17
aVWe're always trying to make it faster.
p18
aVSo every two weeks, we will be making
p19
aVabout 5,000 new components to fit to the car.
p20
aVFive to 10 percent of the race car
p21
aVwill be different every two weeks of the year.
p22
aVSo how do we do that?
p23
aVWell, we start our life with the racing car.
p24
aVWe have a lot of sensors on the car to measure things.
p25
aVOn the race car in front of you here
p26
aVthere are about 120 sensors when it goes into a race.
p27
aVIt's measuring all sorts of things around the car.
p28
aVThat data is logged. We're logging about
p29
aV500 different parameters within the data systems,
p30
aVabout 13,000 health parameters and events
p31
aVto say when things are not working the way they should do,
p32
aVand we're sending that data back to the garage
p33
aVusing telemetry at a rate of two to four megabits per second.
p34
aVSo during a two-hour race, each car will be sending
p35
aV750 million numbers.
p36
aVThat's twice as many numbers as words that each of us
p37
aVspeaks in a lifetime.
p38
aVIt's a huge amount of data.
p39
aVBut it's not enough just to have data and measure it.
p40
aVYou need to be able to do something with it.
p41
aVSo we've spent a lot of time and effort
p42
aVin turning the data into stories
p43
aVto be able to tell, what's the state of the engine,
p44
aVhow are the tires degrading,
p45
aVwhat's the situation with fuel consumption?
p46
aVSo all of this is taking data
p47
aVand turning it into knowledge that we can act upon.
p48
aVOkay, so let's have a look at a little bit of data.
p49
aVLet's pick a bit of data from
p50
aVanother three-month-old patient.
p51
aVThis is a child, and what you're seeing here is real data,
p52
aVand on the far right-hand side,
p53
aVwhere everything starts getting a little bit catastrophic,
p54
aVthat is the patient going into cardiac arrest.
p55
aVIt was deemed to be an unpredictable event.
p56
aVThis was a heart attack that no one could see coming.
p57
aVBut when we look at the information there,
p58
aVwe can see that things are starting to become
p59
aVa little fuzzy about five minutes or so before the cardiac arrest.
p60
aVWe can see small changes
p61
aVin things like the heart rate moving.
p62
aVThese were all undetected by normal thresholds
p63
aVwhich would be applied to data.
p64
aVSo the question is, why couldn't we see it?
p65
aVWas this a predictable event?
p66
aVCan we look more at the patterns in the data
p67
aVto be able to do things better?
p68
aVSo this is a child,
p69
aVabout the same age as the racing car on stage,
p70
aVthree months old.
p71
aVIt's a patient with a heart problem.
p72
aVNow, when you look at some of the data on the screen above,
p73
aVthings like heart rate, pulse, oxygen, respiration rates,
p74
aVthey're all unusual for a normal child,
p75
aVbut they're quite normal for the child there,
p76
aVand so one of the challenges you have in health care is,
p77
aVhow can I look at the patient in front of me,
p78
aVhave something which is specific for her,
p79
aVand be able to detect when things start to change,
p80
aVwhen things start to deteriorate?
p81
aVBecause like a racing car, any patient,
p82
aVwhen things start to go bad, you have a short time
p83
aVto make a difference.
p84
aVSo what we did is we took a data system
p85
aVwhich we run every two weeks of the year in Formula 1
p86
aVand we installed it on the hospital computers
p87
aVat Birmingham Children's Hospital.
p88
aVWe streamed data from the bedside instruments
p89
aVin their pediatric intensive care
p90
aVso that we could both look at the data in real time
p91
aVand, more importantly, to store the data
p92
aVso that we could start to learn from it.
p93
aVAnd then, we applied an application on top
p94
aVwhich would allow us to tease out the patterns in the data
p95
aVin real time so we could see what was happening,
p96
aVso we could determine when things started to change.
p97
aVNow, in motor racing, we're all a little bit ambitious,
p98
aVaudacious, a little bit arrogant sometimes,
p99
aVso we decided we would also look at the children
p100
aVas they were being transported to intensive care.
p101
aVWhy should we wait until they arrived in the hospital
p102
aVbefore we started to look?
p103
aVAnd so we installed a real-time link
p104
aVbetween the ambulance and the hospital,
p105
aVjust using normal 3G telephony to send that data
p106
aVso that the ambulance became an extra bed
p107
aVin intensive care.
p108
aVAnd then we started looking at the data.
p109
aVSo the wiggly lines at the top, all the colors,
p110
aVthis is the normal sort of data you would see on a monitor \u2014
p111
aVheart rate, pulse, oxygen within the blood,
p112
aVand respiration.
p113
aVThe lines on the bottom, the blue and the red,
p114
aVthese are the interesting ones.
p115
aVThe red line is showing an automated version
p116
aVof the early warning score
p117
aVthat Birmingham Children's Hospital were already running.
p118
aVThey'd been running that since 2008,
p119
aVand already have stopped cardiac arrests
p120
aVand distress within the hospital.
p121
aVThe blue line is an indication
p122
aVof when patterns start to change,
p123
aVand immediately, before we even started
p124
aVputting in clinical interpretation,
p125
aVwe can see that the data is speaking to us.
p126
aVIt's telling us that something is going wrong.
p127
aVThe plot with the red and the green blobs,
p128
aVthis is plotting different components
p129
aVof the data against each other.
p130
aVThe green is us learning what is normal for that child.
p131
aVWe call it the cloud of normality.
p132
aVAnd when things start to change,
p133
aVwhen conditions start to deteriorate,
p134
aVwe move into the red line.
p135
aVThere's no rocket science here.
p136
aVIt is displaying data that exists already in a different way,
p137
aVto amplify it, to provide cues to the doctors,
p138
aVto the nurses, so they can see what's happening.
p139
aVIn the same way that a good racing driver
p140
aVrelies on cues to decide when to apply the brakes,
p141
aVwhen to turn into a corner,
p142
aVwe need to help our physicians and our nurses
p143
aVto see when things are starting to go wrong.
p144
aVSo we have a very ambitious program.
p145
aVWe think that the race is on to do something differently.
p146
aVWe are thinking big. It's the right thing to do.
p147
aVWe have an approach which, if it's successful,
p148
aVthere's no reason why it should stay within a hospital.
p149
aVIt can go beyond the walls.
p150
aVWith wireless connectivity these days,
p151
aVthere is no reason why patients, doctors and nurses
p152
aValways have to be in the same place
p153
aVat the same time.
p154
aVAnd meanwhile, we'll take our little three-month-old baby,
p155
aVkeep taking it to the track, keeping it safe,
p156
aVand making it faster and better.
p157
aVThank you very much.
