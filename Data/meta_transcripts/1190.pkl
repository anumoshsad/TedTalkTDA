VIt's the Second World War.
p4
aVA German prison camp.
p5
aVAnd this man,
p6
aVArchie Cochrane,
p7
aVis a prisoner of war and a doctor,
p8
aVand he has a problem.
p9
aVThe problem is that the men under his care
p10
aVare suffering
p11
aVfrom an excruciating and debilitating condition
p12
aVthat Archie doesn't really understand.
p13
aVThe symptoms
p14
aVare this horrible swelling up of fluids under the skin.
p15
aVBut he doesn't know whether it's an infection, whether it's to do with malnutrition.
p16
aVHe doesn't know how to cure it.
p17
aVAnd he's operating in a hostile environment.
p18
aVAnd people do terrible things in wars.
p19
aVThe German camp guards, they've got bored.
p20
aVThey've taken to just firing into the prison camp at random
p21
aVfor fun.
p22
aVOn one particular occasion,
p23
aVone of the guards threw a grenade into the prisoners' lavatory
p24
aVwhile it was full of prisoners.
p25
aVHe said he heard suspicious laughter.
p26
aVAnd Archie Cochrane, as the camp doctor,
p27
aVwas one of the first men in
p28
aVto clear up the mess.
p29
aVAnd one more thing:
p30
aVArchie was suffering from this illness himself.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo the situation seemed pretty desperate.
p33
aVBut Archie Cochrane
p34
aVwas a resourceful person.
p35
aVHe'd already smuggled vitamin C into the camp,
p36
aVand now he managed
p37
aVto get hold of supplies of marmite
p38
aVon the black market.
p39
aVNow some of you will be wondering what marmite is.
p40
aVMarmite is a breakfast spread beloved of the British.
p41
aVIt looks like crude oil.
p42
aVIt tastes ...
p43
aVzesty.
p44
aVAnd importantly,
p45
aVit's a rich source
p46
aVof vitamin B12.
p47
aVSo Archie splits the men under his care as best he can
p48
aVinto two equal groups.
p49
aVHe gives half of them vitamin C.
p50
aVHe gives half of them vitamin B12.
p51
aVHe very carefully and meticulously notes his results
p52
aVin an exercise book.
p53
aVAnd after just a few days,
p54
aVit becomes clear
p55
aVthat whatever is causing this illness,
p56
aVmarmite is the cure.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo Cochrane then goes to the Germans who are running the prison camp.
p59
aVNow you've got to imagine at the moment \u2014
p60
aVforget this photo, imagine this guy
p61
aVwith this long ginger beard and this shock of red hair.
p62
aVHe hasn't been able to shave \u2014 a sort of Billy Connolly figure.
p63
aVCochrane, he starts ranting at these Germans
p64
aVin this Scottish accent \u2014
p65
aVin fluent German, by the way, but in a Scottish accent \u2014
p66
aVand explains to them how German culture was the culture
p67
aVthat gave Schiller and Goethe to the world.
p68
aVAnd he can't understand
p69
aVhow this barbarism can be tolerated,
p70
aVand he vents his frustrations.
p71
aVAnd then he goes back to his quarters,
p72
aVbreaks down and weeps
p73
aVbecause he's convinced that the situation is hopeless.
p74
aVBut a young German doctor
p75
aVpicks up Archie Cochrane's exercise book
p76
aVand says to his colleagues,
p77
aV"This evidence is incontrovertible.
p78
aVIf we don't supply vitamins to the prisoners,
p79
aVit's a war crime."
p80
aVAnd the next morning,
p81
aVsupplies of vitamin B12 are delivered to the camp,
p82
aVand the prisoners begin to recover.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow I'm not telling you this story
p85
aVbecause I think Archie Cochrane is a dude,
p86
aValthough Archie Cochrane is a dude.
p87
aVI'm not even telling you the story
p88
aVbecause I think we should be running
p89
aVmore carefully controlled randomized trials
p90
aVin all aspects of public policy,
p91
aValthough I think that would also be completely awesome.
p92
aVI'm telling you this story
p93
aVbecause Archie Cochrane, all his life,
p94
aVfought against a terrible affliction,
p95
aVand he realized it was debilitating to individuals
p96
aVand it was corrosive to societies.
p97
aVAnd he had a name for it.
p98
aVHe called it the God complex.
p99
aVNow I can describe the symptoms of the God complex very, very easily.
p100
aVSo the symptoms of the complex
p101
aVare, no matter how complicated the problem,
p102
aVyou have an absolutely overwhelming belief
p103
aVthat you are infallibly right in your solution.
p104
aa(lp105
VNow Archie was a doctor,
p106
aVso he hung around with doctors a lot.
p107
aVAnd doctors suffer from the God complex a lot.
p108
aVNow I'm an economist, I'm not a doctor,
p109
aVbut I see the God complex around me all the time
p110
aVin my fellow economists.
p111
aVI see it in our business leaders.
p112
aVI see it in the politicians we vote for \u2014
p113
aVpeople who, in the face of an incredibly complicated world,
p114
aVare nevertheless absolutely convinced
p115
aVthat they understand the way that the world works.
p116
aVAnd you know, with the future billions that we've been hearing about,
p117
aVthe world is simply far too complex
p118
aVto understand in that way.
p119
aa(lp120
VWell let me give you an example.
p121
aVImagine for a moment
p122
aVthat, instead of Tim Harford in front of you,
p123
aVthere was Hans Rosling presenting his graphs.
p124
aVYou know Hans:
p125
aVthe Mick Jagger of TED.
p126
aV(Laughter)
p127
aVAnd he'd be showing you these amazing statistics,
p128
aVthese amazing animations.
p129
aVAnd they are brilliant; it's wonderful work.
p130
aVBut a typical Hans Rosling graph:
p131
aVthink for a moment, not what it shows,
p132
aVbut think instead about what it leaves out.
p133
aVSo it'll show you GDP per capita,
p134
aVpopulation, longevity,
p135
aVthat's about it.
p136
aVSo three pieces of data for each country \u2014
p137
aVthree pieces of data.
p138
aVThree pieces of data is nothing.
p139
aVI mean, have a look at this graph.
p140
aa(lp141
VThis is produced by the physicist Cesar Hidalgo.
p142
aVHe's at MIT.
p143
aVNow you won't be able to understand a word of it,
p144
aVbut this is what it looks like.
p145
aVCesar has trolled the database
p146
aVof over 5,000 different products,
p147
aVand he's used techniques of network analysis
p148
aVto interrogate this database
p149
aVand to graph relationships between the different products.
p150
aVAnd it's wonderful, wonderful work.
p151
aVYou show all these interconnections, all these interrelations.
p152
aVAnd I think it'll be profoundly useful
p153
aVin understanding how it is that economies grow.
p154
aVBrilliant work.
p155
aVCesar and I tried to write a piece for The New York Times Magazine
p156
aVexplaining how this works.
p157
aVAnd what we learned
p158
aVis Cesar's work is far too good to explain
p159
aVin The New York Times Magazine.
p160
aa(lp161
VFive thousand products \u2014
p162
aVthat's still nothing.
p163
aVFive thousand products \u2014
p164
aVimagine counting every product category
p165
aVin Cesar Hidalgo's data.
p166
aVImagine you had one second
p167
aVper product category.
p168
aVIn about the length of this session,
p169
aVyou would have counted all 5,000.
p170
aVNow imagine doing the same thing
p171
aVfor every different type of product on sale in Walmart.
p172
aVThere are 100,000 there. It would take you all day.
p173
aVNow imagine trying to count
p174
aVevery different specific product and service
p175
aVon sale in a major economy
p176
aVsuch as Tokyo, London or New York.
p177
aVIt's even more difficult in Edinburgh
p178
aVbecause you have to count all the whisky and the tartan.
p179
aVIf you wanted to count every product and service
p180
aVon offer in New York \u2014
p181
aVthere are 10 billion of them \u2014
p182
aVit would take you 317 years.
p183
aVThis is how complex the economy we've created is.
p184
aVAnd I'm just counting toasters here.
p185
aVI'm not trying to solve the Middle East problem.
p186
aVThe complexity here is unbelievable.
p187
aVAnd just a piece of context \u2014
p188
aVthe societies in which our brains evolved
p189
aVhad about 300 products and services.
p190
aVYou could count them in five minutes.
p191
aa(lp192
VSo this is the complexity of the world that surrounds us.
p193
aVThis perhaps is why
p194
aVwe find the God complex so tempting.
p195
aVWe tend to retreat and say, "We can draw a picture,
p196
aVwe can post some graphs,
p197
aVwe get it, we understand how this works."
p198
aVAnd we don't.
p199
aVWe never do.
p200
aVNow I'm not trying to deliver a nihilistic message here.
p201
aVI'm not trying to say we can't solve
p202
aVcomplicated problems in a complicated world.
p203
aVWe clearly can.
p204
aVBut the way we solve them
p205
aVis with humility \u2014
p206
aVto abandon the God complex
p207
aVand to actually use a problem-solving technique that works.
p208
aVAnd we have a problem-solving technique that works.
p209
aVNow you show me
p210
aVa successful complex system,
p211
aVand I will show you a system
p212
aVthat has evolved through trial and error.
p213
aa(lp214
VHere's an example.
p215
aVThis baby was produced through trial and error.
p216
aVI realize that's an ambiguous statement.
p217
aVMaybe I should clarify it.
p218
aVThis baby is a human body: it evolved.
p219
aVWhat is evolution?
p220
aVOver millions of years, variation and selection,
p221
aVvariation and selection \u2014
p222
aVtrial and error,
p223
aVtrial and error.
p224
aVAnd it's not just biological systems
p225
aVthat produce miracles through trial and error.
p226
aVYou could use it in an industrial context.
p227
aa(lp228
VSo let's say you wanted to make detergent.
p229
aVLet's say you're Unilever
p230
aVand you want to make detergent in a factory near Liverpool.
p231
aVHow do you do it?
p232
aVWell you have this great big tank full of liquid detergent.
p233
aVYou pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle.
p234
aVYou create a spray of detergent.
p235
aVThen the spray dries. It turns into powder.
p236
aVIt falls to the floor.
p237
aVYou scoop it up. You put it in cardboard boxes.
p238
aVYou sell it at a supermarket.
p239
aVYou make lots of money.
p240
aVHow do you design that nozzle?
p241
aVIt turns out to be very important.
p242
aVNow if you ascribe to the God complex,
p243
aVwhat you do is you find yourself a little God.
p244
aVYou find yourself a mathematician; you find yourself a physicist \u2014
p245
aVsomebody who understands the dynamics of this fluid.
p246
aVAnd he will, or she will,
p247
aVcalculate the optimal design of the nozzle.
p248
aVNow Unilever did this and it didn't work \u2014
p249
aVtoo complicated.
p250
aVEven this problem, too complicated.
p251
aa(lp252
VBut the geneticist Professor Steve Jones
p253
aVdescribes how Unilever actually did solve this problem \u2014
p254
aVtrial and error,
p255
aVvariation and selection.
p256
aVYou take a nozzle
p257
aVand you create 10 random variations on the nozzle.
p258
aVYou try out all 10; you keep the one that works best.
p259
aVYou create 10 variations on that one.
p260
aVYou try out all 10. You keep the one that works best.
p261
aVYou try out 10 variations on that one.
p262
aVYou see how this works, right?
p263
aVAnd after 45 generations,
p264
aVyou have this incredible nozzle.
p265
aVIt looks a bit like a chess piece \u2014
p266
aVfunctions absolutely brilliantly.
p267
aVWe have no idea
p268
aVwhy it works,
p269
aVno idea at all.
p270
aVAnd the moment you step back from the God complex \u2014
p271
aVlet's just try to have a bunch of stuff;
p272
aVlet's have a systematic way of determining what's working and what's not \u2014
p273
aVyou can solve your problem.
p274
aa(lp275
VNow this process of trial and error
p276
aVis actually far more common in successful institutions
p277
aVthan we care to recognize.
p278
aVAnd we've heard a lot about how economies function.
p279
aVThe U.S. economy is still the world's greatest economy.
p280
aVHow did it become the world's greatest economy?
p281
aVI could give you all kinds of facts and figures
p282
aVabout the U.S. economy,
p283
aVbut I think the most salient one is this:
p284
aVten percent of American businesses
p285
aVdisappear every year.
p286
aVThat is a huge failure rate.
p287
aVIt's far higher than the failure rate of, say, Americans.
p288
aVTen percent of Americans don't disappear every year.
p289
aVWhich leads us to conclude
p290
aVAmerican businesses fail faster than Americans,
p291
aVand therefore American businesses are evolving faster than Americans.
p292
aVAnd eventually, they'll have evolved to such a high peak of perfection
p293
aVthat they will make us all their pets \u2014
p294
aV(Laughter)
p295
aVif, of course, they haven't already done so.
p296
aVI sometimes wonder.
p297
aVBut it's this process of trial and error
p298
aVthat explains this great divergence,
p299
aVthis incredible performance of Western economies.
p300
aVIt didn't come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge.
p301
aVIt's come through trial and error.
p302
aa(lp303
VNow I've been sort of banging on about this
p304
aVfor the last couple of months,
p305
aVand people sometimes say to me,
p306
aV"Well Tim, it's kind of obvious.
p307
aVObviously trial and error is very important.
p308
aVObviously experimentation is very important.
p309
aVNow why are you just wandering around saying this obvious thing?"
p310
aa(lp311
VSo I say, okay, fine.
p312
aVYou think it's obvious?
p313
aVI will admit it's obvious
p314
aVwhen schools
p315
aVstart teaching children
p316
aVthat there are some problems that don't have a correct answer.
p317
aVStop giving them lists of questions
p318
aVevery single one of which has an answer.
p319
aVAnd there's an authority figure in the corner
p320
aVbehind the teacher's desk who knows all the answers.
p321
aVAnd if you can't find the answers,
p322
aVyou must be lazy or stupid.
p323
aVWhen schools stop doing that all the time,
p324
aVI will admit that, yes,
p325
aVit's obvious that trial and error is a good thing.
p326
aVWhen a politician stands up
p327
aVcampaigning for elected office
p328
aVand says, "I want to fix our health system.
p329
aVI want to fix our education system.
p330
aVI have no idea how to do it.
p331
aVI have half a dozen ideas.
p332
aVWe're going to test them out. They'll probably all fail.
p333
aVThen we'll test some other ideas out.
p334
aVWe'll find some that work. We'll build on those.
p335
aVWe'll get rid of the ones that don't." \u2014
p336
aVwhen a politician campaigns on that platform,
p337
aVand more importantly, when voters like you and me
p338
aVare willing to vote for that kind of politician,
p339
aVthen I will admit
p340
aVthat it is obvious that trial and error works, and that \u2014 thank you.
p341
aa(lp342
V(Applause)
p343
aa(lp344
VUntil then, until then
p345
aVI'm going to keep banging on about trial and error
p346
aVand why we should abandon the God complex.
p347
aVBecause it's so hard
p348
aVto admit our own fallibility.
p349
aVIt's so uncomfortable.
p350
aVAnd Archie Cochrane understood this as well as anybody.
p351
aVThere's this one trial he ran
p352
aVmany years after World War II.
p353
aVHe wanted to test out
p354
aVthe question of, where is it
p355
aVthat patients should recover
p356
aVfrom heart attacks?
p357
aVShould they recover in a specialized cardiac unit in hospital,
p358
aVor should they recover at home?
p359
aVAll the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down.
p360
aVThey had the God complex in spades.
p361
aVThey knew that their hospitals were the right place for patients,
p362
aVand they knew it was very unethical
p363
aVto run any kind of trial or experiment.
p364
aa(lp365
VNevertheless, Archie managed to get permission to do this.
p366
aVHe ran his trial.
p367
aVAnd after the trial had been running for a little while,
p368
aVhe gathered together all his colleagues
p369
aVaround his table,
p370
aVand he said, "Well, gentlemen,
p371
aVwe have some preliminary results.
p372
aVThey're not statistically significant.
p373
aVBut we have something.
p374
aVAnd it turns out that you're right and I'm wrong.
p375
aVIt is dangerous for patients
p376
aVto recover from heart attacks at home.
p377
aVThey should be in hospital."
p378
aVAnd there's this uproar, and all the doctors start pounding the table
p379
aVand saying, "We always said you were unethical, Archie.
p380
aVYou're killing people with your clinical trials. You need to shut it down now.
p381
aVShut it down at once."
p382
aVAnd there's this huge hubbub.
p383
aVArchie lets it die down.
p384
aVAnd then he says, "Well that's very interesting, gentlemen,
p385
aVbecause when I gave you the table of results,
p386
aVI swapped the two columns around.
p387
aVIt turns out your hospitals are killing people,
p388
aVand they should be at home.
p389
aVWould you like to close down the trial now,
p390
aVor should we wait until we have robust results?"
p391
aVTumbleweed
p392
aVrolls through the meeting room.
p393
aa(lp394
VBut Cochrane would do that kind of thing.
p395
aVAnd the reason he would do that kind of thing
p396
aVis because he understood
p397
aVit feels so much better
p398
aVto stand there and say,
p399
aV"Here in my own little world,
p400
aVI am a god, I understand everything.
p401
aVI do not want to have my opinions challenged.
p402
aVI do not want to have my conclusions tested."
p403
aVIt feels so much more comfortable
p404
aVsimply to lay down the law.
p405
aVCochrane understood
p406
aVthat uncertainty, that fallibility,
p407
aVthat being challenged, they hurt.
p408
aVAnd you sometimes need to be shocked out of that.
p409
aVNow I'm not going to pretend that this is easy.
p410
aVIt isn't easy.
p411
aVIt's incredibly painful.
p412
aa(lp413
VAnd since I started talking about this subject
p414
aVand researching this subject,
p415
aVI've been really haunted by something
p416
aVa Japanese mathematician said on the subject.
p417
aVSo shortly after the war,
p418
aVthis young man, Yutaka Taniyama,
p419
aVdeveloped this amazing conjecture
p420
aVcalled the Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture.
p421
aVIt turned out to be absolutely instrumental
p422
aVmany decades later
p423
aVin proving Fermat's Last Theorem.
p424
aVIn fact, it turns out it's equivalent
p425
aVto proving Fermat's Last Theorem.
p426
aVYou prove one, you prove the other.
p427
aVBut it was always a conjecture.
p428
aVTaniyama tried and tried and tried
p429
aVand he could never prove that it was true.
p430
aVAnd shortly before his 30th birthday in 1958,
p431
aVYutaka Taniyama killed himself.
p432
aVHis friend, Goro Shimura \u2014
p433
aVwho worked on the mathematics with him \u2014
p434
aVmany decades later, reflected on Taniyama's life.
p435
aVHe said,
p436
aV"He was not a very careful person
p437
aVas a mathematician.
p438
aVHe made a lot of mistakes.
p439
aVBut he made mistakes in a good direction.
p440
aVI tried to emulate him,
p441
aVbut I realized
p442
aVit is very difficult
p443
aVto make good mistakes."
p444
