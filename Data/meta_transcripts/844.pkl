VHi, my name is Roz Savage
p4
aVand I row across oceans.
p5
aVFour years ago, I rowed solo across the Atlantic,
p6
aVand since then, I've done two out of three stages
p7
aVacross the Pacific,
p8
aVfrom San Francisco to Hawaii
p9
aVand from Hawaii to Kiribati.
p10
aVAnd tomorrow, I'll be leaving this boat
p11
aVto fly back to Kiribati
p12
aVto continue with the third and final stage
p13
aVof my row across the Pacific.
p14
aVCumulatively, I will have rowed
p15
aVover 8,000 miles,
p16
aVtaken over three million oar strokes
p17
aVand spent more than 312 days alone
p18
aVon the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat.
p19
aVThis has given me a very
p20
aVspecial relationship with the ocean.
p21
aVWe have a bit of a love/hate thing going on.
p22
aVI feel a bit about it like I did about
p23
aVa very strict math teacher that I once had at school.
p24
aVI didn't always like her, but I did respect her,
p25
aVand she taught me a heck of a lot.
p26
aVSo today I'd like to share with you
p27
aVsome of my ocean adventures
p28
aVand tell you a little bit about what they've taught me,
p29
aVand how I think we can maybe take some of those lessons
p30
aVand apply them to this environmental challenge
p31
aVthat we face right now.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, some of you might be thinking,
p34
aV"Hold on a minute. She doesn't look very much like an ocean rower.
p35
aVIsn't she meant to be about this tall
p36
aVand about this wide
p37
aVand maybe look a bit more like these guys?"
p38
aVYou'll notice, they've all got something that I don't.
p39
aVWell, I don't know what you're thinking, but I'm talking about the beards. (Laughter)
p40
aVAnd no matter how long I've spent on the ocean,
p41
aVI haven't yet managed to muster a decent beard,
p42
aVand I hope that it remains that way.
p43
aa(lp44
VFor a long time, I didn't believe that I could have a big adventure.
p45
aVThe story that I told myself was
p46
aVthat adventurers looked like this.
p47
aVI didn't look the part.
p48
aVI thought there were them and there were us,
p49
aVand I was not one of them.
p50
aVSo for 11 years, I conformed.
p51
aVI did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do.
p52
aVI was working in an office in London
p53
aVas a management consultant.
p54
aVAnd I think I knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me.
p55
aVBut that kind of conditioning
p56
aVjust kept me there for so many years,
p57
aVuntil I reached my mid-30s and I thought,
p58
aV"You know, I'm not getting any younger.
p59
aVI feel like I've got a purpose in this life, and I don't know what it is,
p60
aVbut I'm pretty certain that management consultancy is not it.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo, fast forward a few years.
p63
aVI'd gone through some changes.
p64
aVTo try and answer that question of,
p65
aV"What am I supposed to be doing with my life?"
p66
aVI sat down one day
p67
aVand wrote two versions of my own obituary,
p68
aVthe one that I wanted, a life of adventure,
p69
aVand the one that I was actually heading for
p70
aVwhich was a nice, normal, pleasant life,
p71
aVbut it wasn't where I wanted to be by the end of my life.
p72
aVI wanted to live a life that I could be proud of.
p73
aVAnd I remember looking at these two versions of my obituary
p74
aVand thinking, "Oh boy,
p75
aVI'm on totally the wrong track here.
p76
aVIf I carry on living as I am now,
p77
aVI'm just not going to end up where I want to be
p78
aVin five years, or 10 years,
p79
aVor at the end of my life."
p80
aVI made a few changes,
p81
aVlet go of some loose trappings of my old life,
p82
aVand through a bit of a leap of logic,
p83
aVdecided to row across the Atlantic Ocean.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VThe Atlantic Rowing Race runs from the Canaries to Antigua,
p88
aVit's about 3,000 miles,
p89
aVand it turned out to be
p90
aVthe hardest thing I had ever done.
p91
aVSure, I had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone,
p92
aVbut what I'd sort of failed to notice was that
p93
aVgetting out of your comfort zone is, by definition,
p94
aVextremely uncomfortable.
p95
aVAnd my timing was not great either:
p96
aV2005, when I did the Atlantic,
p97
aVwas the year of Hurricane Katrina.
p98
aVThere were more tropical storms in the North Atlantic
p99
aVthan ever before, since records began.
p100
aVAnd pretty early on,
p101
aVthose storms started making their presence known.
p102
aa(lp103
VAll four of my oars broke
p104
aVbefore I reached halfway across.
p105
aVOars are not supposed to look like this.
p106
aVBut what can you do? You're in the middle of the ocean.
p107
aVOars are your only means of propulsion.
p108
aVSo I just had to look around the boat
p109
aVand figure out what I was going to use
p110
aVto fix up these oars so that I could carry on.
p111
aVSo I found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape
p112
aVand splintered the boat hook
p113
aVto the oars to reinforce it.
p114
aVThen, when that gave out,
p115
aVI sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat
p116
aVand used those.
p117
aVAnd then when those gave out, I cannibalized one of the broken oars.
p118
aVI'd never been very good at fixing stuff
p119
aVwhen I was living my old life,
p120
aVbut it's amazing how resourceful you can become
p121
aVwhen you're in the middle of the ocean
p122
aVand there's only one way to get to the other side.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd the oars kind of became a symbol
p125
aVof just in how many ways
p126
aVI went beyond what I thought were my limits.
p127
aVI suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders
p128
aVand saltwater sores on my bottom.
p129
aVI really struggled psychologically,
p130
aVtotally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge,
p131
aVrealizing that, if I carried on moving at two miles an hour,
p132
aV3,000 miles was going to
p133
aVtake me a very, very long time.
p134
aVThere were so many times
p135
aVwhen I thought I'd hit that limit,
p136
aVbut had no choice but to just carry on
p137
aVand try and figure out how I was going to get to the other side
p138
aVwithout driving myself crazy.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd eventually after
p141
aV103 days at sea,
p142
aVI arrived in Antigua.
p143
aVI don't think I've ever felt so happy
p144
aVin my entire life.
p145
aVIt was a bit like finishing a marathon
p146
aVand getting out of solitary confinement
p147
aVand winning an Oscar all rolled into one.
p148
aVI was euphoric.
p149
aVAnd to see all the people coming out to greet me
p150
aVand standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering,
p151
aVI just felt like a movie star.
p152
aVIt was absolutely wonderful.
p153
aVAnd I really learned then that, the bigger the challenge,
p154
aVthe bigger the sense of achievement
p155
aVwhen you get to the end of it.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo this might be a good moment to take a quick time-out
p158
aVto answer a few FAQs about ocean rowing
p159
aVthat might be going through your mind.
p160
aVNumber one that I get asked: What do you eat?
p161
aVA few freeze-dried meals, but mostly I try and eat
p162
aVmuch more unprocessed foods.
p163
aVSo I grow my own beansprouts.
p164
aVI eat fruits and nut bars,
p165
aVa lot of nuts.
p166
aVAnd generally arrive about 30 pounds lighter
p167
aVat the other end.
p168
aVQuestion number two: How do you sleep?
p169
aVWith my eyes shut. Ha-ha.
p170
aVI suppose what you mean is:
p171
aVWhat happens to the boat while I'm sleeping?
p172
aVWell, I plan my route so that I'm drifting
p173
aVwith the winds and the currents while I'm sleeping.
p174
aVOn a good night, I think my best ever was 11 miles
p175
aVin the right direction.
p176
aVWorst ever, 13 miles in the wrong direction.
p177
aVThat's a bad day at the office.
p178
aVWhat do I wear?
p179
aVMostly, a baseball cap,
p180
aVrowing gloves and a smile \u2014 or a frown,
p181
aVdepending on whether I went backwards overnight \u2014
p182
aVand lots of sun lotion.
p183
aVDo I have a chase boat?
p184
aVNo I don't. I'm totally self-supporting out there.
p185
aVI don't see anybody for the whole time
p186
aVthat I'm at sea, generally.
p187
aVAnd finally: Am I crazy?
p188
aVWell, I leave that one up to you to judge.
p189
aa(lp190
VSo, how do you top rowing across the Atlantic?
p191
aVWell, naturally, you decide to row across the Pacific.
p192
aVWell, I thought the Atlantic was big,
p193
aVbut the Pacific is really, really big.
p194
aVI think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps.
p195
aVI don't know for sure that the Brits
p196
aVinvented this particular view of the world, but I suspect we might have done so:
p197
aVwe are right in the middle,
p198
aVand we've cut the Pacific in half
p199
aVand flung it to the far corners of the world.
p200
aVWhereas if you look in Google Earth,
p201
aVthis is how the Pacific looks.
p202
aVIt pretty much covers half the planet.
p203
aVYou can just see a little bit of North America up here
p204
aVand a sliver of Australia down there.
p205
aVIt is really big \u2014
p206
aV65 million square miles \u2014
p207
aVand to row in a straight line across it
p208
aVwould be about 8,000 miles.
p209
aVUnfortunately, ocean rowboats
p210
aVvery rarely go in a straight line.
p211
aVBy the time I get to Australia,
p212
aVif I get to Australia,
p213
aVI will have rowed probably nine or 10,000 miles in all.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo, because nobody in their straight mind would row
p216
aVstraight past Hawaii without dropping in,
p217
aVI decided to cut this very big undertaking
p218
aVinto three segments.
p219
aVThe first attempt didn't go so well.
p220
aVIn 2007, I did a rather involuntary capsize drill
p221
aVthree times in 24 hours.
p222
aVA bit like being in a washing machine.
p223
aVBoat got a bit dinged up,
p224
aVso did I.
p225
aVI blogged about it. Unfortunately, somebody
p226
aVwith a bit of a hero complex decided that
p227
aVthis damsel was in distress and needed saving.
p228
aVThe first I knew about this was when the Coast Guard plane turned up overhead.
p229
aVI tried to tell them to go away.
p230
aVWe had a bit of a battle of wills.
p231
aVI lost and got airlifted.
p232
aVAwful, really awful.
p233
aVIt was one of the worst feelings of my life,
p234
aVas I was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter
p235
aVand looked down at my trusty little boat
p236
aVrolling around in the 20 foot waves
p237
aVand wondering if I would ever see her again.
p238
aVSo I had to launch a very expensive
p239
aVsalvage operation
p240
aVand then wait another nine months
p241
aVbefore I could get back out onto the ocean again.
p242
aa(lp243
VBut what do you do?
p244
aVFall down nine times, get up 10.
p245
aVSo, the following year, I set out
p246
aVand, fortunately, this time made it safely across to Hawaii.
p247
aVBut it was not without misadventure.
p248
aVMy watermaker broke,
p249
aVonly the most important piece of kit that I have on the boat.
p250
aVPowered by my solar panels,
p251
aVit sucks in saltwater
p252
aVand turns it into freshwater.
p253
aVBut it doesn't react very well to being immersed in ocean,
p254
aVwhich is what happened to it.
p255
aVFortunately, help was at hand.
p256
aa(lp257
VThere was another unusual boat out there
p258
aVat the same time, doing as I was doing,
p259
aVbringing awareness to the North Pacific Garbage Patch,
p260
aVthat area in the North Pacific about twice the size of Texas,
p261
aVwith an estimated 3.5 million
p262
aVtons of trash in it,
p263
aVcirculating at the center of
p264
aVthat North Pacific Gyre.
p265
aVSo, to make the point, these guys
p266
aVhad actually built their boat out of plastic trash,
p267
aV15,000 empty water bottles
p268
aVlatched together into two pontoons.
p269
aVThey were going very slowly.
p270
aVPartly, they'd had a bit of a delay.
p271
aVThey'd had to pull in at Catalina Island shortly after they left Long Beach
p272
aVbecause the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone,
p273
aVand they were starting to sink.
p274
aVSo they'd had to pull in and do all the lids up.
p275
aa(lp276
VBut, as I was approaching the end of my water reserves,
p277
aVluckily, our courses were converging.
p278
aVThey were running out of food; I was running out of water.
p279
aVSo we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up.
p280
aVAnd it took about a week
p281
aVfor us to actually gradually converge.
p282
aVI was doing a pathetically slow speed
p283
aVof about 1.3 knots,
p284
aVand they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4:
p285
aVit was like two snails in a mating dance.
p286
aVBut, eventually, we did manage to meet up
p287
aVand Joel hopped overboard,
p288
aVcaught us a beautiful, big mahi-mahi,
p289
aVwhich was the best food I'd had
p290
aVin, ooh, at least three months.
p291
aa(lp292
VFortunately, the one that he caught that day
p293
aVwas better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier.
p294
aVWhen they opened this one up,
p295
aVthey found its stomach was full of plastic.
p296
aVAnd this is really bad news because plastic
p297
aVis not an inert substance.
p298
aVIt leaches out chemicals
p299
aVinto the flesh of the poor critter that ate it,
p300
aVand then we come along and eat that poor critter,
p301
aVand we get some of the toxins accumulating
p302
aVin our bodies as well.
p303
aVSo there are very real implications for human health.
p304
aa(lp305
VI eventually made it to Hawaii still alive.
p306
aVAnd, the following year, set out
p307
aVon the second stage of the Pacific,
p308
aVfrom Hawaii down to Tarawa.
p309
aVAnd you'll notice something about Tarawa;
p310
aVit is very low-lying.
p311
aVIt's that little green sliver on the horizon,
p312
aVwhich makes them very nervous
p313
aVabout rising oceans.
p314
aVThis is big trouble for these guys.
p315
aVThey've got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level.
p316
aVAnd also, as an increase in extreme
p317
aVweather events due to climate change,
p318
aVthey're expecting more waves
p319
aVto come in over the fringing reef,
p320
aVwhich will contaminate their fresh water supply.
p321
aVI had a meeting with the president there,
p322
aVwho told me about his
p323
aVexit strategy for his country.
p324
aVHe expects that within the next 50 years,
p325
aVthe 100,000 people that live there
p326
aVwill have to relocate to
p327
aVNew Zealand or Australia.
p328
aVAnd that made me think about how would I feel
p329
aVif Britain was going to disappear under the waves;
p330
aVif the places where I'd been born
p331
aVand gone to school
p332
aVand got married,
p333
aVif all those places were just going to disappear forever.
p334
aVHow, literally, ungrounded
p335
aVthat would make me feel.
p336
aa(lp337
VVery shortly, I'll be setting out to try and get to Australia,
p338
aVand if I'm successful, I'll be the first woman ever to row solo
p339
aVall the way across the Pacific.
p340
aVAnd I try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues,
p341
aVto bring a human face to the ocean.
p342
aVIf the Atlantic was about my inner journey,
p343
aVdiscovering my own capabilities,
p344
aVmaybe the Pacific has been about my outer journey,
p345
aVfiguring out how I can use
p346
aVmy interesting career choice
p347
aVto be of service to the world,
p348
aVand to take some of those things that I've learned out there
p349
aVand apply them to the situation
p350
aVthat humankind now finds itself in.
p351
aa(lp352
VI think there are probably three key points here.
p353
aVThe first one is about
p354
aVthe stories that we tell ourselves.
p355
aVFor so long, I told myself
p356
aVthat I couldn't have an adventure
p357
aVbecause I wasn't six foot tall
p358
aVand athletic and bearded.
p359
aVAnd then that story changed.
p360
aVI found out that people had rowed across oceans.
p361
aVI even met one of them and she was just about my size.
p362
aVSo even though I didn't grow any taller,
p363
aVI didn't sprout a beard,
p364
aVsomething had changed: My interior dialogue had changed.
p365
aVAt the moment, the story that we collectively tell ourselves
p366
aVis that we need all this stuff,
p367
aVthat we need oil.
p368
aVBut what about if we just change that story?
p369
aVWe do have alternatives,
p370
aVand we have the power of free will
p371
aVto choose those alternatives, those sustainable ones,
p372
aVto create a greener future.
p373
aa(lp374
VThe second point is about
p375
aVthe accumulation of tiny actions.
p376
aVWe might think that anything that we do as an individual
p377
aVis just a drop in the ocean, that it can't really make a difference.
p378
aVBut it does. Generally, we haven't
p379
aVgot ourselves into this mess through big disasters.
p380
aVYes, there have been the Exxon Valdezes
p381
aVand the Chernobyls,
p382
aVbut mostly it's been an accumulation
p383
aVof bad decisions
p384
aVby billions of individuals,
p385
aVday after day and year after year.
p386
aVAnd, by the same token, we can turn that tide.
p387
aVWe can start making better,
p388
aVwiser, more sustainable decisions.
p389
aVAnd when we do that, we're not just one person.
p390
aVAnything that we do spreads ripples.
p391
aVOther people will see if you're in the supermarket line
p392
aVand you pull out your
p393
aVreusable grocery bag.
p394
aVMaybe if we all start doing this,
p395
aVwe can make it socially unacceptable
p396
aVto say yes to plastic in the checkout line.
p397
aVThat's just one example.
p398
aVThis is a world-wide community.
p399
aa(lp400
VThe other point:
p401
aVIt's about taking responsibility.
p402
aVFor so much of my life,
p403
aVI wanted something else to make me happy.
p404
aVI thought if I had the right house or the right car
p405
aVor the right man in my life,
p406
aVthen I could be happy.
p407
aVBut when I wrote that obituary exercise,
p408
aVI actually grew up a little bit in that moment
p409
aVand realized that I needed to create my own future.
p410
aVI couldn't just wait passively
p411
aVfor happiness to come and find me.
p412
aVAnd I suppose I'm a selfish environmentalist.
p413
aVI plan on being around for a long time,
p414
aVand when I'm 90 years old,
p415
aVI want to be happy and healthy.
p416
aVAnd it's very difficult to be happy
p417
aVon a planet that's racked
p418
aVwith famine and drought.
p419
aVIt's very difficult to be healthy on a planet
p420
aVwhere we've poisoned the earth
p421
aVand the sea and the air.
p422
aa(lp423
VSo, shortly, I'm going to be
p424
aVlaunching a new initiative
p425
aVcalled Eco-Heroes.
p426
aVAnd the idea here is that
p427
aVall our Eco-Heroes will log at least one green deed every day.
p428
aVIt's meant to be a bit of a game.
p429
aVWe're going to make an iPhone app out of it.
p430
aVWe just want to try and create that awareness
p431
aVbecause, sure, changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world,
p432
aVbut that attitude,
p433
aVthat awareness that leads you to change the light bulb
p434
aVor take your reusable coffee mug,
p435
aVthat is what could change the world.
p436
aa(lp437
VI really believe that we stand
p438
aVat a very important point in history.
p439
aVWe have a choice. We've been blessed,
p440
aVor cursed, with free will.
p441
aVWe can choose a greener future,
p442
aVand we can get there
p443
aVif we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time.
p444
aa(lp445
VThank you.
