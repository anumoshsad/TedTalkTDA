VLadies and gentlemen,
p4
aVI present to you the human genome.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Applause)
p7
aa(lp8
VChromosome one \u2014 top left, bottom right \u2014 are the sex chromosomes.
p9
aVWomen have two copies of that big X chromosome;
p10
aVmen have the X and, of course, that small copy of the Y.
p11
aVSorry boys, but it's just a tiny little thing that makes you different.
p12
aVSo if you zoom in on this genome,
p13
aVthen what you see, of course, is this double-helix structure \u2014
p14
aVthe code of life spelled out with these four biochemical letters,
p15
aVor we call them bases: A, C, G and T.
p16
aVHow many are there in the human genome? Three billion.
p17
aVIs that a big number?
p18
aVWell, everybody can throw around big numbers.
p19
aVBut in fact, if I were to place one base
p20
aVon each pixel of this 1280x800-resolution screen,
p21
aVwe would need 3,000 screens to take a look at the genome.
p22
aVSo it's really quite big.
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd perhaps because of its size,
p25
aVa group of people \u2014 all, by the way, with Y chromosomes \u2014
p26
aVdecided they would want to sequence it.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd so 15 years, actually, and about four billion dollars later,
p31
aVthe genome was sequenced and published.
p32
aVIn 2003, the final version was published, and they keep working on it.
p33
aVThat was all done on a machine like this.
p34
aVIt costs about a dollar for each base \u2014 a very slow way of doing it.
p35
aa(lp36
VWell, folks, I'm here to tell you
p37
aVthat the world has completely changed,
p38
aVand none of you know about it.
p39
aVSo now what we do is take a genome,
p40
aVwe make maybe 50 copies of it,
p41
aVwe cut all those copies up into little 50-base reads,
p42
aVand then we sequence them, massively parallel.
p43
aVThen we bring that into software and reassemble it,
p44
aVand tell you what the story is.
p45
aVSo to give you a picture of what this looks like,
p46
aVthe Human Genome Project: 3 gigabases, right?
p47
aVOne run on one of these modern machines: 200 gigabases in a week.
p48
aVAnd that 200 is going to change to 600 this summer,
p49
aVand there's no sign of this pace slowing.
p50
aVThe price of a base, to sequence a base,
p51
aVhas fallen 100 million times.
p52
aVThat's the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in 1998,
p53
aVwaiting until 2011,
p54
aVand now you can drive to Jupiter and back twice.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VWorld population,
p59
aVPC placements,
p60
aVthe archive of all of medical literature,
p61
aVMoore's law,
p62
aVthe old way of sequencing,
p63
aVand here's all the new stuff.
p64
aVGuys, this is a long scale;
p65
aVyou don't typically see lines that go up like that.
p66
aVSo the worldwide capacity to sequence human genomes
p67
aVis something like 50,000 to 100,000 human genomes this year.
p68
aVWe know this based on the machines that are being placed.
p69
aVThis is expected to double, triple or maybe quadruple
p70
aVyear over year for the foreseeable future.
p71
aVIn fact, there's one lab in particular
p72
aVthat represents 20 percent of all that capacity:
p73
aVIt's called the Beijing Genomics Institute.
p74
aVThe Chinese are absolutely winning this race to the new Moon, by the way.
p75
aVWhat does this mean for medicine?
p76
aa(lp77
VSo a woman, age 37,
p78
aVpresents with stage 2 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.
p79
aVShe is treated with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation.
p80
aVShe goes home.
p81
aVTwo years later,
p82
aVshe comes back with stage 3C ovarian cancer, unfortunately;
p83
aVtreated again with surgery and chemotherapy.
p84
aVShe comes back three years later at age 42
p85
aVwith more ovarian cancer, more chemotherapy.
p86
aVSix months later,
p87
aVshe comes back with acute myeloid leukemia.
p88
aVShe goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo first: the way in which this woman was treated,
p91
aVin as little as 10 years, will look like bloodletting.
p92
aVAnd it's because of people like my colleague, Rick Wilson,
p93
aVat the Genome Institute at Washington University,
p94
aVwho decided to take a look at this woman postmortem.
p95
aVAnd he took skin cells, healthy skin
p96
aVand cancerous bone marrow,
p97
aVand sequenced the whole genomes of both of them
p98
aVin a couple of weeks, no big deal.
p99
aVThen he compared those two genomes in software,
p100
aVand what he found, among other things,
p101
aVwas a deletion \u2014 a 2,000-base deletion across three billion bases
p102
aVin a particular gene called TP53.
p103
aVIf you have this deleterious mutation in this gene,
p104
aVyou're 90 percent likely to get cancer in your life.
p105
aa(lp106
VSo unfortunately, this doesn't help this woman,
p107
aVbut it does have severe \u2014 profound, if you will \u2014
p108
aVimplications to her family.
p109
aVI mean, if they have the same mutation,
p110
aVand they get this genetic test and they understand it,
p111
aVthen they can get regular screens and can catch cancer early,
p112
aVand potentially live a significantly longer life.
p113
aa(lp114
VLet me introduce you to the Beery twins,
p115
aVdiagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two.
p116
aVTheir mom is a very brave woman who didn't believe it;
p117
aVthe symptoms weren't matching up.
p118
aVAnd through some heroic efforts and a lot of Internet searching,
p119
aVshe was able to convince the medical community
p120
aVthat, in fact, they had something else.
p121
aVThey had dopa-responsive dystonia.
p122
aVAnd so they were given L-Dopa,
p123
aVand their symptoms did improve,
p124
aVbut they weren't totally asymptomatic.
p125
aVSignificant problems remained.
p126
aa(lp127
VTurns out the gentleman in this picture is a guy named Joe Beery,
p128
aVwho was lucky enough to be the CIO
p129
aVof a company called Life Technologies.
p130
aVThey're one of two companies
p131
aVthat makes these massive whole-genome sequencing tools.
p132
aVAnd so he got his kids sequenced.
p133
aVWhat they found was a series of mutations in a gene called SPR,
p134
aVwhich is responsible for producing serotonin, among other things.
p135
aVSo on top of L-Dopa, they gave these kids a serotonin precursor drug,
p136
aVand they're effectively normal now.
p137
aVGuys, this would never have happened without whole-genome sequencing.
p138
aVAt the time \u2014 this was a few years ago \u2014 it cost $100,000.
p139
aVToday it's $10,000, next year, $1,000,
p140
aVthe year after, $100, give or take a year.
p141
aVThat's how fast this is moving.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo here's little Nick \u2014
p144
aVlikes Batman and squirt guns.
p145
aVAnd it turns out Nick shows up at the children's hospital
p146
aVwith this distended belly, like a famine victim.
p147
aVAnd it's not that he's not eating; it's that when he eats,
p148
aVhis intestine basically opens up and feces spill out into his gut.
p149
aVSo a hundred surgeries later,
p150
aVhe looks at his mom and says, "Mom, please pray for me.
p151
aVI'm in so much pain."
p152
aVHis pediatrician happens to have a background in clinical genetics
p153
aVand he has no idea what's going on,
p154
aVbut he says, "Let's get this kid's genome sequenced."
p155
aVAnd what they find is a single-point mutation
p156
aVin a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death.
p157
aVSo the theory is that he's having some immunological reaction
p158
aVto what's going on \u2014 to the food, essentially.
p159
aVAnd that's a natural reaction, which causes some programmed cell death,
p160
aVbut the gene that regulates that down is broken.
p161
aVAnd so this informs, among other things, of course,
p162
aVa treatment for bone marrow transplant, which he undertakes.
p163
aVAnd after nine months of grueling recovery,
p164
aVhe's now eating steak with A1 sauce.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VThe prospect of using the genome as a universal diagnostic
p169
aVis upon us today.
p170
aVToday. It's here.
p171
aVAnd what it means for all of us
p172
aVis that everybody in this room could live an extra 5, 10, 20 years,
p173
aVjust because of this one thing.
p174
aVWhich is a fantastic story,
p175
aVunless you think about humanity's footprint on the planet,
p176
aVand our ability to keep up food production.
p177
aVSo it turns out
p178
aVthat the very same technology is also being used to grow new lines
p179
aVof corn, wheat, soybean and other crops
p180
aVthat are highly tolerant of drought, of flood,
p181
aVof pests and pesticides.
p182
aVNow, look \u2014
p183
aVas long as we continue to increase the population,
p184
aVwe'll have to continue to grow and eat genetically modified foods.
p185
aVAnd that's the only position I'll take today.
p186
aVUnless there's anybody in the audience
p187
aVwho'd like to volunteer to stop eating?
p188
aVNone, not one.
p189
aa(lp190
VThis is a typewriter,
p191
aVa staple of every desktop for decades.
p192
aVAnd, in fact, the typewriter was essentially deleted by this thing.
p193
aVAnd then more general versions of word processors came about.
p194
aVBut ultimately, it was a disruption on top of a disruption.
p195
aVIt was Bob Metcalfe inventing the Ethernet,
p196
aVand the connection of all these computers
p197
aVthat fundamentally changed everything.
p198
aVSuddenly we had Netscape, we had Yahoo.
p199
aVAnd we had, indeed, the entire dot-com bubble.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VNot to worry though,
p204
aVthat was quickly rescued by the iPod, Facebook
p205
aVand, indeed, Angry Birds.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VLook, this is where we are today.
p210
aVThis is the genomic revolution today. This is where we are.
p211
aVWhat I'd like you to consider is:
p212
aVWhat does it mean
p213
aVwhen these dots don't represent the individual bases of your genome,
p214
aVbut they connect to genomes all across the planet?
p215
aVI just recently had to buy life insurance, and I was required to answer:
p216
aVA. I have never had a genetic test;
p217
aVB. I've had one, here you go;
p218
aVor C. I've had one and I'm not telling.
p219
aVThankfully, I was able to answer A,
p220
aVand I say that honestly, in case my life insurance agent is listening.
p221
aVBut what would have happened if I had said C?
p222
aa(lp223
VConsumer applications for genomics will flourish.
p224
aVDo you want to see if you're genetically compatible
p225
aVwith your girlfriend?
p226
aVDNA sequencing on your iPhone? There's an app for that.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VPersonalized genomic massage, anyone?
p231
aVThere's already a lab today that tests for allele 334 of the AVPR1 gene,
p232
aVthe so-called cheating gene.
p233
aa(lp234
V(Laughter)
p235
aa(lp236
VSo anybody who's here today with your significant other,
p237
aVjust turn over to them, swab their mouth, send it to the lab
p238
aVand you'll know for sure.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VDo you really want to elect a president
p243
aVwhose genome suggests cardiomyopathy?
p244
aVThink of it \u2014 it's 2016,
p245
aVand the leading candidate releases
p246
aVnot only her four years of back-tax returns,
p247
aVbut also her personal genome.
p248
aVAnd it looks really good.
p249
aVThen she challenges all her competitors to do the same.
p250
aVDo you think that's not going to happen?
p251
aVDo you think it would have helped John McCain?
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
VHow many people in the audience have the last name Resnick, like me?
p256
aVRaise your hand.
p257
aVAnybody? Nobody.
p258
aVTypically, there's one or two.
p259
aVSo my father's father was one of 10 Resnick brothers.
p260
aVThey all hated each other, and all moved to different parts of the planet.
p261
aVSo it's likely I'm related to every Resnick that I ever meet,
p262
aVbut I don't know.
p263
aVSo imagine if my genome were De-identified, sitting in software,
p264
aVAnd a third cousin's genome was also sitting there,
p265
aVand there was software that could compare the two
p266
aVand make these associations.
p267
aVNot hard to imagine. My company has software that does this right now.
p268
aVImagine one more thing,
p269
aVthat that software is able to ask both parties for mutual consent:
p270
aV"Would you be willing to meet your third cousin?"
p271
aVAnd if we both say yes \u2014 voilà!
p272
aVWelcome to Chromosomally LinkedIn.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VNow this is probably a good thing, right?
p277
aVBigger clan gatherings and so on.
p278
aVBut maybe it's a bad thing as well.
p279
aVHow many fathers in the room? Raise your hands.
p280
aVOK, so experts think that one to three percent of you
p281
aVare not actually the father of your child.
p282
aa(lp283
V(Laughter)
p284
aa(lp285
VLook \u2014
p286
aa(lp287
V(Laughter)
p288
aa(lp289
VThese genomes, these 23 chromosomes,
p290
aVthey don't in any way represent the quality of our relationships
p291
aVor the nature of our society \u2014 at least not yet.
p292
aVAnd like any new technology,
p293
aVit's really in humanity's hands
p294
aVto wield it for the betterment of mankind
p295
aVor not.
p296
aVAnd so I urge you all to wake up and to tune in
p297
aVand to influence the genomic revolution that's happening all around you.
p298
aa(lp299
VThank you.
