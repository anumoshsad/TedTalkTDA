VIt is actually a reality today
p4
aVthat you can download products from the Web \u2014
p5
aVproduct data, I should say, from the Web \u2014
p6
aVperhaps tweak it and personalize it
p7
aVto your own preference or your own taste,
p8
aVand have that information sent
p9
aVto a desktop machine
p10
aVthat will fabricate it for you on the spot.
p11
aVWe can actually build for you,
p12
aVvery rapidly,
p13
aVa physical object.
p14
aVAnd the reason we can do this
p15
aVis through an emerging technology
p16
aVcalled additive manufacturing,
p17
aVor 3D printing.
p18
aa(lp19
VThis is a 3D printer.
p20
aVThey have been around
p21
aVfor almost 30 years now,
p22
aVwhich is quite amazing to think of,
p23
aVbut they're only just starting
p24
aVto filter into the public arena.
p25
aVAnd typically, you would take data,
p26
aVlike the data of a pen here,
p27
aVwhich would be a geometric representation of that product in 3D,
p28
aVand we would pass that data with material
p29
aVinto a machine.
p30
aVAnd a process that would happen in the machine
p31
aVwould mean layer by layer that product would be built.
p32
aVAnd we can take out the physical product,
p33
aVand ready to use,
p34
aVor to, perhaps, assemble into something else.
p35
aa(lp36
VBut if these machines have been around for almost 30 years,
p37
aVwhy don't we know about them?
p38
aVBecause typically they've been too inefficient,
p39
aVinaccessible,
p40
aVthey've not been fast enough,
p41
aVthey've been quite expensive.
p42
aVBut today,
p43
aVit is becoming a reality
p44
aVthat they are now becoming successful.
p45
aVMany barriers are breaking down.
p46
aVThat means that you guys
p47
aVwill soon be able to access one of these machines,
p48
aVif not this minute.
p49
aVAnd it will change and disrupt
p50
aVthe landscape of manufacturing,
p51
aVand most certainly our lives, our businesses
p52
aVand the lives of our children.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo how does it work?
p55
aVIt typically reads CAD data,
p56
aVwhich is a product design data
p57
aVcreated on professional product design programs.
p58
aVAnd here you can see an engineer \u2014
p59
aVit could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer \u2014
p60
aVcreate a product in 3D.
p61
aVAnd this data gets sent to a machine
p62
aVthat slices the data
p63
aVinto two-dimensional representations of that product
p64
aVall the way through \u2014
p65
aValmost like slicing it like salami.
p66
aVAnd that data, layer by layer, gets passed through the machine,
p67
aVstarting at the base of the product
p68
aVand depositing material, layer upon layer,
p69
aVinfusing the new layer of materials to the old layer
p70
aVin an additive process.
p71
aVAnd this material that's deposited
p72
aVeither starts as a liquid form
p73
aVor a material powder form.
p74
aVAnd the bonding process can happen
p75
aVby either melting and depositing or depositing then melting.
p76
aVIn this case, we can see a laser sintering machine developed by EOS.
p77
aVIt's actually using a laser
p78
aVto fuse the new layer of material to the old layer.
p79
aVAnd over time \u2014
p80
aVquite rapidly actually, in a number of hours \u2014
p81
aVwe can build a physical product,
p82
aVready to take out of the machine and use.
p83
aVAnd this is quite an extraordinary idea,
p84
aVbut it is reality today.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo all these products that you can see on the screen
p87
aVwere made in the same way.
p88
aVThey were all 3D printed.
p89
aVAnd you can see,
p90
aVthey're ranging from shoes,
p91
aVrings that were made out of stainless steal,
p92
aVphone covers out of plastic,
p93
aVall the way through to spinal implants, for example,
p94
aVthat were created out of medical-grade titanium,
p95
aVand engine parts.
p96
aVBut what you'll notice about all of these products
p97
aVis they're very, very intricate.
p98
aVThe design is quite extraordinary.
p99
aVBecause we're taking this data in 3D form,
p100
aVslicing it up before it gets past the machine,
p101
aVwe can actually create structures
p102
aVthat are more intricate
p103
aVthan any other manufacturing technology \u2014
p104
aVor, in fact, are impossible to build in any other way.
p105
aVAnd you can create parts with moving components,
p106
aVhinges, parts within parts.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo in some cases, we can abolish totally
p109
aVthe need for manual labor.
p110
aVIt sounds great.
p111
aVIt is great.
p112
aVWe can have 3D printers today
p113
aVthat build structures like these.
p114
aVThis is almost three meters high.
p115
aVAnd this was built
p116
aVby depositing artificial sandstone layer upon layer
p117
aVin layers of about five millimeters to 10 mm in thickness \u2014
p118
aVslowly growing this structure.
p119
aVThis was created by an architectural firm called Shiro.
p120
aVAnd you can actually walk into it.
p121
aVAnd on the other end of the spectrum,
p122
aVthis is a microstructure.
p123
aVIt's created depositing layers
p124
aVof about four microns.
p125
aVSo really the resolution is quite incredible.
p126
aVThe detail that you can get today
p127
aVis quite amazing.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo who's using it?
p130
aVTypically, because we can create products very rapidly,
p131
aVit's been used by product designers,
p132
aVor anyone who wanted to prototype a product
p133
aVand very quickly create or reiterate a design.
p134
aVAnd actually what's quite amazing about this technology as well
p135
aVis that you can create bespoke products en masse.
p136
aVThere's very little economies of scale.
p137
aVSo you can now create one-offs very easily.
p138
aVArchitects, for example,
p139
aVthey want to create prototypes of buildings.
p140
aVAgain you can see,
p141
aVthis is a building of the Free University in Berlin
p142
aVand it was designed by Foster and Partners.
p143
aVAgain, not buildable in any other way.
p144
aVAnd very hard to even create this by hand.
p145
aa(lp146
VNow this is an engine component.
p147
aVIt was developed by a company called Within Technologies
p148
aVand 3T RPD.
p149
aVIt's very, very, very detailed
p150
aVinside with the design.
p151
aVNow 3D printing
p152
aVcan break away barriers in design
p153
aVwhich challenge the constraints
p154
aVof mass production.
p155
aVIf we slice into this product which is actually sitting here,
p156
aVyou can see that it has a number of cooling channels pass through it,
p157
aVwhich means it's a more efficient product.
p158
aVYou can't create this with standard manufacturing techniques
p159
aVeven if you tried to do it manually.
p160
aVIt's more efficient
p161
aVbecause we can now create all these cavities within the object
p162
aVthat cool fluid.
p163
aVAnd it's used by aerospace
p164
aVand automotive.
p165
aVIt's a lighter part
p166
aVand it uses less material waste.
p167
aVSo it's overall performance and efficiency
p168
aVjust exceeds standard mass produced products.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd then taking this idea
p171
aVof creating a very detailed structure,
p172
aVwe can apply it to honeycomb structures
p173
aVand use them within implants.
p174
aVTypically an implant
p175
aVis more effective within the body
p176
aVif it's more porous,
p177
aVbecause our body tissue will grow into it.
p178
aVThere's a lower chance of rejection.
p179
aVBut it's very hard to create that in standard ways.
p180
aVWith 3D printing,
p181
aVwe're seeing today
p182
aVthat we can create much better implants.
p183
aVAnd in fact, because we can create
p184
aVbespoke products en masse, one-offs,
p185
aVwe can create implants
p186
aVthat are specific to individuals.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo as you can see,
p189
aVthis technology and the quality of what comes out of the machines is fantastic.
p190
aVAnd we're starting to see it being used
p191
aVfor final end products.
p192
aVAnd in fact, as the detail is improving,
p193
aVthe quality is improving,
p194
aVthe price of the machines are falling
p195
aVand they're becoming quicker.
p196
aVThey're also now small enough
p197
aVto sit on a desktop.
p198
aVYou can buy a machine today for about $300
p199
aVthat you can create yourself,
p200
aVwhich is quite incredible.
p201
aa(lp202
VBut then it begs the question,
p203
aVwhy don't we all have one in our home?
p204
aVBecause, simply, most of us here today
p205
aVdon't know how to create the data
p206
aVthat a 3D printer reads.
p207
aVIf I gave you a 3D printer,
p208
aVyou wouldn't know how to direct it
p209
aVto make what you want it to.
p210
aVBut there are more and more
p211
aVtechnologies, software and processes today
p212
aVthat are breaking down those barriers.
p213
aVI believe we're at a tipping point
p214
aVwhere this is now something
p215
aVthat we can't avoid.
p216
aVThis technology
p217
aVis really going to disrupt
p218
aVthe landscape of manufacturing
p219
aVand, I believe, cause a revolution
p220
aVin manufacturing.
p221
aa(lp222
VSo today,
p223
aVyou can download products from the Web \u2014
p224
aVanything you would have on your desktop,
p225
aVlike pens, whistles, lemon squeezers.
p226
aVYou can use software like Google SketchUp
p227
aVto create products from scratch
p228
aVvery easily.
p229
aV3D printing can be also used
p230
aVto download spare parts from the Web.
p231
aVSo imagine you have, say,
p232
aVa Hoover in your home
p233
aVand it has broken down. You need a spare part,
p234
aVbut you realize that Hoover's been discontinued.
p235
aVCan you imagine going online \u2014
p236
aVthis is a reality \u2014
p237
aVand finding that spare part
p238
aVfrom a database of geometries
p239
aVof that discontinued product
p240
aVand downloading that information, that data,
p241
aVand having the product made for you at home,
p242
aVready to use, on your demand?
p243
aVAnd in fact, because we can create spare parts
p244
aVwith things the machines
p245
aVare quite literally making themselves.
p246
aVYou're having machines fabricate themselves.
p247
aVThese are parts of a RepRap machine,
p248
aVwhich is a kind of desktop printer.
p249
aa(lp250
VBut what interests my company the most
p251
aVis the fact that you can create
p252
aVindividual unique products en masse.
p253
aVThere's no need to do a run
p254
aVof thousands of millions
p255
aVor send that product to be injection molded in China.
p256
aVYou can just make it physically on the spot.
p257
aVWhich means
p258
aVthat we can now present to the public
p259
aVthe next generation of customization.
p260
aVThis is something that is now possible today,
p261
aVthat you can direct personally
p262
aVhow you want your products to look.
p263
aa(lp264
VWe're all familiar with the idea
p265
aVof customization or personalization.
p266
aVBrands like Nike are doing it.
p267
aVIt's all over the Web.
p268
aVIn fact, every major household name
p269
aVis allowing you
p270
aVto interact with their products
p271
aVon a daily basis \u2014
p272
aVall the way from Smart Cars
p273
aVto Prada
p274
aVto Ray Ban, for example.
p275
aVBut this is not really mass customization;
p276
aVit's known as variant production,
p277
aVvariations of the same product.
p278
aVWhat you could do is really influence your product now
p279
aVand shape-manipulate your product.
p280
aa(lp281
VI'm not sure about you guys,
p282
aVbut I've had experiences
p283
aVwhen I've walked into a store and I've know exactly what I've wanted
p284
aVand I've searched everywhere for that perfect lamp
p285
aVthat I know where I want to sit in my house
p286
aVand I just can't find the right thing,
p287
aVor that perfect piece of jewelry
p288
aVas a gift or for myself.
p289
aVImagine that you can now
p290
aVengage with a brand
p291
aVand interact,
p292
aVso that you can pass your personal attributes
p293
aVto the products that you're about to buy.
p294
aa(lp295
VYou can today
p296
aVdownload a product with software like this,
p297
aVview the product in 3D.
p298
aVThis is the sort of 3D data
p299
aVthat a machine will read.
p300
aVThis is a lamp.
p301
aVAnd you can start iterating the design.
p302
aVYou can direct what color that product will be,
p303
aVperhaps what material.
p304
aVAnd also, you can engage in shape manipulation of that product,
p305
aVbut within boundaries that are safe.
p306
aVBecause obviously the public are not professional product designers.
p307
aVThe piece of software will keep an individual
p308
aVwithin the bounds of the possible.
p309
aVAnd when somebody is ready to purchase the product
p310
aVin their personalized design,
p311
aVthey click "Enter" and this data gets converted
p312
aVinto the data that a 3D printer reads
p313
aVand gets passed to a 3D printer,
p314
aVperhaps on someone's desktop.
p315
aa(lp316
VBut I don't think that that's immediate.
p317
aVI don't think that will happen soon.
p318
aVWhat's more likely, and we're seeing it today,
p319
aVis that data gets sent
p320
aVto a local manufacturing center.
p321
aVThis means lower carbon footprint.
p322
aVWe're now, instead of shipping a product across the world,
p323
aVwe're sending data across the Internet.
p324
aVHere's the product being built.
p325
aVYou can see, this came out of the machine in one piece
p326
aVand the electronics were inserted later.
p327
aVIt's this lamp, as you can see here.
p328
aVSo as long as you have the data,
p329
aVyou can create the part on demand.
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd you don't necessarily need to use this
p332
aVfor just aesthetic customization,
p333
aVyou can use it for functional customization,
p334
aVscanning parts of the body
p335
aVand creating things that are made to fit.
p336
aVSo we can run this through to something like prosthetics,
p337
aVwhich is highly specialized to an individual's handicap.
p338
aVOr we can create very specific prosthetics
p339
aVfor that individual.
p340
aVScanning teeth today,
p341
aVyou can have your teeth scanned
p342
aVand dental coatings made in this way to fit you.
p343
aVWhile you wait at the dentist,
p344
aVa machine will quietly be creating this for you
p345
aVready to insert in the teeth.
p346
aa(lp347
VAnd the idea of now creating implants,
p348
aVscanning data, an MRI scan of somebody
p349
aVcan now be converted into 3D data
p350
aVand we can create very specific implants for them.
p351
aVAnd applying this
p352
aVto the idea of building up what's in our bodies.
p353
aVYou know, this is pair of lungs and the bronchial tree.
p354
aVIt's very intricate.
p355
aVYou couldn't really create this or simulate it in any other way.
p356
aVBut with MRI data,
p357
aVwe can just build the product,
p358
aVas you can see, very intricately.
p359
aVUsing this process,
p360
aVpioneers in the industry are layering up cells today.
p361
aVSo one of the pioneers, for example, is Dr. Anthony Atala,
p362
aVand he has been working
p363
aVon layering cells to create body parts \u2014
p364
aVbladders, valves, kidneys.
p365
aVNow this is not something that's ready for the public,
p366
aVbut it is in working progress.
p367
aa(lp368
VSo just to finalize, we're all individual.
p369
aVWe all have different preferences, different needs.
p370
aVWe like different things.
p371
aVWe're all different sizes and our companies the same.
p372
aVBusinesses want different things.
p373
aVWithout a doubt in my mind,
p374
aVI believe that this technology
p375
aVis going to cause a manufacturing revolution
p376
aVand will change the landscape of manufacturing as we know it.
p377
aa(lp378
