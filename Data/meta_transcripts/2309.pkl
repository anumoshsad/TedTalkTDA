VFor the past decade,
p4
aVI've been studying non-state armed groups:
p5
aVarmed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or militias.
p6
aVI document what these groups do when they're not shooting.
p7
aVMy goal is to better understand these violent actors
p8
aVand to study ways to encourage transition from violent engagement
p9
aVto nonviolent confrontation.
p10
aVI work in the field, in the policy world and in the library.
p11
aa(lp12
VUnderstanding non-state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict,
p13
aVbecause war has changed.
p14
aVIt used to be a contest between states.
p15
aVNo longer.
p16
aVIt is now a conflict between states and non-state actors.
p17
aVFor example, of the 216 peace agreements
p18
aVsigned between 1975 and 2011,
p19
aV196 of them were between a state and a non-state actor.
p20
aVSo we need to understand these groups; we need to either engage them
p21
aVor defeat them in any conflict resolution process that has to be successful.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo how do we do that?
p24
aVWe need to know what makes these organizations tick.
p25
aVWe know a lot about how they fight, why they fight,
p26
aVbut no one looks at what they're doing when they're not fighting.
p27
aVYet, armed struggle and unarmed politics are related.
p28
aVIt is all part of the same organization.
p29
aVWe cannot understand these groups, let alone defeat them,
p30
aVif we don't have the full picture.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd armed groups today are complex organizations.
p33
aVTake the Lebanese Hezbollah,
p34
aVknown for its violent confrontation against Israel.
p35
aVBut since its creation in the early 1980s,
p36
aVHezbollah has also set up a political party,
p37
aVa social-service network, and a military apparatus.
p38
aVSimilarly, the Palestinian Hamas,
p39
aVknown for its suicide attacks against Israel,
p40
aValso runs the Gaza Strip since 2007.
p41
aVSo these groups do way more than just shoot.
p42
aVThey multi-task.
p43
aVThey set up complex communication machines \u2014
p44
aVradio stations, TV channels,
p45
aVInternet websites and social media strategies.
p46
aVAnd up here, you have the ISIS magazine,
p47
aVprinted in English and published to recruit.
p48
aVArmed groups also invest in complex fund-raising \u2014
p49
aVnot looting, but setting up profitable businesses;
p50
aVfor example, construction companies.
p51
aVNow, these activities are keys.
p52
aVThey allow these groups to increase their strength,
p53
aVincrease their funds,
p54
aVto better recruit and to build their brand.
p55
aa(lp56
VArmed groups also do something else:
p57
aVthey build stronger bonds with the population
p58
aVby investing in social services.
p59
aVThey build schools, they run hospitals,
p60
aVthey set up vocational-training programs or micro-loan programs.
p61
aVHezbollah offers all of these services and more.
p62
aVArmed groups also seek to win the population over
p63
aVby offering something that the state is not providing:
p64
aVsafety and security.
p65
aVThe initial rise of the Taliban in war-torn Afghanistan,
p66
aVor even the beginning of the ascent of ISIS,
p67
aVcan be understood also by looking at these groups' efforts
p68
aVto provide security.
p69
aVNow, unfortunately, in these cases,
p70
aVthe provision of security came at an unbearably high price
p71
aVfor the population.
p72
aVBut in general, providing social services fills a gap,
p73
aVa governance gap left by the government,
p74
aVand allows these groups to increase their strength
p75
aVand their power.
p76
aVFor example, the 2006 electoral victory of the Palestinian Hamas
p77
aVcannot be understood without acknowledging the group's social work.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, this is a really complex picture,
p80
aVyet in the West, when we look at armed groups,
p81
aVwe only think of the violent side.
p82
aVBut that's not enough to understand these groups' strength,
p83
aVstrategy or long-term vision.
p84
aVThese groups are hybrid.
p85
aVThey rise because they fill a gap left by the government,
p86
aVand they emerge to be both armed and political,
p87
aVengage in violent struggle and provide governance.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated,
p90
aVthe less we can think of them as the opposite of a state.
p91
aVNow, what do you call a group like Hezbollah?
p92
aVThey run part of a territory, they administer all their functions,
p93
aVthey pick up the garbage, they run the sewage system.
p94
aVIs this a state? Is it a rebel group?
p95
aVOr maybe something else, something different and new?
p96
aVAnd what about ISIS?
p97
aVThe lines are blurred.
p98
aVWe live in a world of states, non-states, and in-between,
p99
aVand the more states are weak, like in the Middle East today,
p100
aVthe more non-state actors step in and fill that gap.
p101
aVThis matters for governments, because to counter these groups,
p102
aVthey will have to invest more in non-military tools.
p103
aVFilling that governance gap
p104
aVhas to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
p105
aVThis also matters very much for peacemaking and peacebuilding.
p106
aVIf we better understand armed groups,
p107
aVwe will better know what incentives to offer
p108
aVto encourage the transition from violence to nonviolence.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo in this new contest between states and non-states,
p111
aVmilitary power can win some battles,
p112
aVbut it will not give us peace nor stability.
p113
aVTo achieve these objectives,
p114
aVwhat we need is a long-term investment in filling that security gap,
p115
aVin filling that governance gap
p116
aVthat allowed these groups to thrive in the first place.
p117
