VI coined my own definition of success in 1934,
p4
aVwhen I was teaching at a high school in South Bend, Indiana,
p5
aVbeing a little bit disappointed, and [disillusioned] perhaps,
p6
aVby the way parents of the youngsters in my English classes
p7
aVexpected their youngsters to get an A or a B.
p8
aVThey thought a C was all right for the neighbors' children,
p9
aVbecause they were all average.
p10
aVBut they weren't satisfied when their own \u2014
p11
aVit would make the teacher feel that they had failed, or the youngster had failed.
p12
aVAnd that's not right.
p13
aVThe good Lord in his infinite wisdom didn't create us all equal
p14
aVas far as intelligence is concerned,
p15
aVany more than we're equal for size, appearance.
p16
aa(lp17
VNot everybody could earn an A or a B, and I didn't like that way of judging,
p18
aVand I did know how the alumni of various schools
p19
aVback in the '30s judged coaches and athletic teams.
p20
aVIf you won them all, you were considered to be reasonably successful \u2014
p21
aVnot completely.
p22
aVBecause I found out \u2014
p23
aVwe had a number of years at UCLA where we didn't lose a game.
p24
aVBut it seemed that we didn't win each individual game
p25
aVby the margin that some of our alumni had predicted \u2014
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aVAnd quite frequently I really felt that they had backed up their predictions
p28
aVin a more materialistic manner.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VBut that was true back in the 30s, so I understood that.
p33
aVBut I didn't like it, I didn't agree with it.
p34
aVI wanted to come up with something I hoped could make me a better teacher,
p35
aVand give the youngsters under my supervision,
p36
aVbe it in athletics or the English classroom,
p37
aVsomething to which to aspire,
p38
aVother than just a higher mark in the classroom,
p39
aVor more points in some athletic contest.
p40
aa(lp41
VI thought about that for quite a spell,
p42
aVand I wanted to come up with my own definition.
p43
aVI thought that might help.
p44
aVAnd I knew how Mr. Webster defined it,
p45
aVas the accumulation of material possessions
p46
aVor the attainment of a position of power or prestige, or something of that sort,
p47
aVworthy accomplishments perhaps,
p48
aVbut in my opinion, not necessarily indicative of success.
p49
aVSo I wanted to come up with something of my own.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd I recalled \u2014
p52
aVI was raised on a small farm in Southern Indiana,
p53
aVand Dad tried to teach me and my brothers
p54
aVthat you should never try to be better than someone else.
p55
aVI'm sure at the time he did that, I didn't \u2014 it didn't \u2014
p56
aVwell, somewhere, I guess in the hidden recesses of the mind,
p57
aVit popped out years later.
p58
aVNever try to be better than someone else,
p59
aValways learn from others.
p60
aVNever cease trying to be the best you can be \u2014
p61
aVthat's under your control.
p62
aVIf you get too engrossed and involved and concerned
p63
aVin regard to the things over which you have no control,
p64
aVit will adversely affect the things over which you have control.
p65
aVThen I ran across this simple verse that said,
p66
aV"At God's footstool to confess,
p67
aVa poor soul knelt, and bowed his head.
p68
aV'I failed!' he cried.
p69
aVThe Master said, 'Thou didst thy best, that is success.'"
p70
aa(lp71
VFrom those things, and one other perhaps,
p72
aVI coined my own definition of success, which is:
p73
aVPeace of mind attained only through self-satisfaction
p74
aVin knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you're capable.
p75
aVI believe that's true.
p76
aVIf you make the effort to do the best of which you're capable,
p77
aVtrying to improve the situation that exists for you,
p78
aVI think that's success,
p79
aVand I don't think others can judge that;
p80
aVit's like character and reputation \u2014
p81
aVyour reputation is what you're perceived to be;
p82
aVyour character is what you really are.
p83
aVAnd I think that character is much more important
p84
aVthan what you are perceived to be.
p85
aVYou'd hope they'd both be good,
p86
aVbut they won't necessarily be the same.
p87
aVWell, that was my idea that I was going to try to get across to the youngsters.
p88
aa(lp89
VI ran across other things.
p90
aVI love to teach, and it was mentioned by the previous speaker
p91
aVthat I enjoy poetry, and I dabble in it a bit, and love it.
p92
aVThere are some things that helped me, I think,
p93
aVbe better than I would have been.
p94
aVI know I'm not what I ought to be, what I should be,
p95
aVbut I think I'm better than I would have been
p96
aVif I hadn't run across certain things.
p97
aVOne was just a little verse that said,
p98
aa(lp99
V"No written word, no spoken plea
p100
aVcan teach our youth what they should be;
p101
aVnor all the books on all the shelves \u2014
p102
aVit's what the teachers are themselves."
p103
aa(lp104
VThat made an impression on me in the 1930s.
p105
aVAnd I tried to use that more or less in my teaching,
p106
aVwhether it be in sports, or whether it be in the English classroom.
p107
aVI love poetry and always had an interest in that somehow.
p108
aVMaybe it's because Dad used to read to us at night,
p109
aVby coal oil lamp \u2014
p110
aVwe didn't have electricity in our farm home.
p111
aVAnd Dad would read poetry to us. So I always liked it.
p112
aVAnd about the same time I ran across this one verse,
p113
aVI ran across another one.
p114
aVSomeone asked a lady teacher why she taught,
p115
aVand after some time, she said she wanted to think about that.
p116
aVThen she came up and said,
p117
aa(lp118
V"They ask me why I teach, and I reply,
p119
aV'Where could I find such splendid company?'
p120
aVThere sits a statesman, strong, unbiased, wise;
p121
aVanother Daniel Webster, silver-tongued.
p122
aVA doctor sits beside him, whose quick, steady hand may mend a bone,
p123
aVor stem the life-blood's flow.
p124
aVAnd there a builder; upward rise the arch of a church he builds,
p125
aVwherein that minister may speak the word of God,
p126
aVand lead a stumbling soul to touch the Christ.
p127
aVAnd all about, a gathering of teachers,
p128
aVfarmers, merchants, laborers \u2014
p129
aVthose who work and vote and build
p130
aVand plan and pray into a great tomorrow.
p131
aVAnd I may say, I may not see the church,
p132
aVor hear the word, or eat the food their hands may grow,
p133
aVbut yet again I may;
p134
aVAnd later I may say,
p135
aVI knew him once, and he was weak, or strong, or bold or proud or gay.
p136
aVI knew him once, but then he was a boy.
p137
aVThey ask me why I teach and I reply,
p138
aV'Where could I find such splendid company?'"
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd I believe the teaching profession \u2014
p141
aVit's true, you have so many youngsters,
p142
aVand I've got to think of my youngsters at UCLA \u2014
p143
aV30-some attorneys, 11 dentists and doctors,
p144
aVmany, many teachers and other professions.
p145
aVAnd that gives you a great deal of pleasure,
p146
aVto see them go on.
p147
aVI always tried to make the youngsters feel that they're there to get an education,
p148
aVnumber one; basketball was second, because it was paying their way,
p149
aVand they do need a little time for social activities,
p150
aVbut you let social activities take a little precedence over the other two,
p151
aVand you're not going to have any very long.
p152
aVSo that was the idea that I tried to get across
p153
aVto the youngsters under my supervision.
p154
aa(lp155
VI had three rules, pretty much,
p156
aVthat I stuck with practically all the time.
p157
aVI'd learned these prior to coming to UCLA, and I decided they were very important.
p158
aVOne was "Never be late."
p159
aVLater on I said certain things \u2014
p160
aVthe players, if we were leaving for somewhere, had to be neat and clean.
p161
aVThere was a time when I made them wear jackets and shirts and ties.
p162
aVThen I saw our chancellor coming to school in denims and turtlenecks,
p163
aVand thought, it's not right for me to keep this other [rule] so I let them just \u2014
p164
aVthey had to be neat and clean.
p165
aVI had one of my greatest players that you probably heard of, Bill Walton.
p166
aVHe came to catch the bus; we were leaving for somewhere to play.
p167
aVAnd he wasn't clean and neat, so I wouldn't let him go.
p168
aVHe couldn't get on the bus,
p169
aVhe had to go home and get cleaned up
p170
aVto get to the airport.
p171
aVSo I was a stickler for that. I believed in that.
p172
aVI believe in time; very important.
p173
aVI believe you should be on time, but I felt at practice, for example \u2014
p174
aVwe start on time, we close on time.
p175
aVThe youngsters didn't have to feel that we were going to keep them over.
p176
aa(lp177
VWhen I speak at coaching clinics, I often tell young coaches \u2014
p178
aVand at coaching clinics, more or less,
p179
aVthey'll be the younger coaches getting in the profession.
p180
aVMost of them are young, you know, and probably newly-married.
p181
aVAnd I tell them, "Don't run practices late,
p182
aVbecause you'll go home in a bad mood,
p183
aVand that's not good, for a young married man to go home in a bad mood.
p184
aVWhen you get older, it doesn't make any difference, but \u2014"
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VSo I did believe: on time.
p189
aa(lp190
VI believe starting on time, and I believe closing on time.
p191
aVAnd another one I had was, not one word of profanity.
p192
aVOne word of profanity, and you are out of here for the day.
p193
aVIf I see it in a game, you're going to come out and sit on the bench.
p194
aVAnd the third one was, never criticize a teammate.
p195
aVI didn't want that. I used to tell them I was paid to do that.
p196
aVThat's my job. I'm paid to do it. Pitifully poor, but I am paid to do it.
p197
aVNot like the coaches today, for gracious sakes, no.
p198
aVIt's a little different than it was in my day.
p199
aVThose were three things that I stuck with pretty closely all the time.
p200
aVAnd those actually came from my dad.
p201
aVThat's what he tried to teach me and my brothers at one time.
p202
aa(lp203
VI came up with a pyramid eventually,
p204
aVthat I don't have the time to go on that.
p205
aVBut that helped me, I think, become a better teacher.
p206
aVIt's something like this:
p207
aVAnd I had blocks in the pyramid,
p208
aVand the cornerstones being industriousness and enthusiasm,
p209
aVworking hard and enjoying what you're doing,
p210
aVcoming up to the apex,
p211
aVaccording to my definition of success.
p212
aVAnd right at the top, faith and patience.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd I say to you, in whatever you're doing,
p215
aVyou must be patient.
p216
aVYou have to have patience to \u2014 we want things to happen.
p217
aVWe talk about our youth being impatient a lot, and they are.
p218
aVThey want to change everything. They think all change is progress.
p219
aVAnd we get a little older \u2014 we sort of let things go.
p220
aVAnd we forget there is no progress without change.
p221
aVSo you must have patience,
p222
aVand I believe that we must have faith.
p223
aVI believe that we must believe, truly believe.
p224
aVNot just give it word service,
p225
aVbelieve that things will work out as they should,
p226
aVproviding we do what we should.
p227
aVI think our tendency is to hope things will turn out the way we want them to
p228
aVmuch of the time,
p229
aVbut we don't do the things that are necessary
p230
aVto make those things become reality.
p231
aVI worked on this for some 14 years,
p232
aVand I think it helped me become a better teacher.
p233
aVBut it all revolved around that original definition of success.
p234
aa(lp235
VYou know, a number of years ago,
p236
aVthere was a Major League Baseball umpire by the name of George Moriarty.
p237
aVHe spelled Moriarty with only one 'i'.
p238
aVI'd never seen that before, but he did.
p239
aVBig league baseball players \u2014
p240
aVthey're very perceptive about those things,
p241
aVand they noticed he had only one 'i' in his name.
p242
aVYou'd be surprised how many also told him
p243
aVthat that was one more than he had in his head
p244
aVat various times.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VBut he wrote something where I think he did
p249
aVwhat I tried to do in this pyramid.
p250
aVHe called it "The Road Ahead, or the Road Behind."
p251
aVHe said, "Sometimes I think the Fates must grin as we denounce them and insist
p252
aVthe only reason we can't win, is the Fates themselves have missed.
p253
aVYet there lives on the ancient claim:
p254
aVwe win or lose within ourselves.
p255
aVThe shining trophies on our shelves can never win tomorrow's game.
p256
aVYou and I know deeper down, there's always a chance to win the crown.
p257
aVBut when we fail to give our best,
p258
aVwe simply haven't met the test, of giving all and saving none
p259
aVuntil the game is really won;
p260
aVof showing what is meant by grit;
p261
aVof playing through when others quit;
p262
aVof playing through, not letting up.
p263
aVIt's bearing down that wins the cup.
p264
aVOf dreaming there's a goal ahead; of hoping when our dreams are dead;
p265
aVof praying when our hopes have fled; yet losing, not afraid to fall,
p266
aVif, bravely, we have given all.
p267
aVFor who can ask more of a man than giving all within his span.
p268
aVGiving all, it seems to me, is not so far from victory.
p269
aVAnd so the Fates are seldom wrong, no matter how they twist and wind.
p270
aVIt's you and I who make our fates \u2014
p271
aVwe open up or close the gates on the road ahead or the road behind."
p272
aa(lp273
VReminds me of another set of threes that my dad tried to get across to us:
p274
aVDon't whine. Don't complain. Don't make excuses.
p275
aVJust get out there,
p276
aVand whatever you're doing, do it to the best of your ability.
p277
aVAnd no one can do more than that.
p278
aVI tried to get across, too, that \u2014
p279
aVmy opponents will tell you \u2014 you never heard me mention winning.
p280
aVNever mention winning.
p281
aVMy idea is that you can lose when you outscore somebody in a game,
p282
aVand you can win when you're outscored.
p283
aVI've felt that way on certain occasions, at various times.
p284
aVAnd I just wanted them to be able to hold their head up after a game.
p285
aVI used to say that when a game is over,
p286
aVand you see somebody that didn't know the outcome,
p287
aVI hope they couldn't tell by your actions
p288
aVwhether you outscored an opponent or the opponent outscored you.
p289
aa(lp290
VThat's what really matters:
p291
aVif you make an effort to do the best you can regularly,
p292
aVthe results will be about what they should be.
p293
aVNot necessarily what you'd want them to be but they'll be about what they should;
p294
aVonly you will know whether you can do that.
p295
aVAnd that's what I wanted from them more than anything else.
p296
aVAnd as time went by, and I learned more about other things,
p297
aVI think it worked a little better,
p298
aVas far as the results.
p299
aVBut I wanted the score of a game to be the byproduct of these other things,
p300
aVand not the end itself.
p301
aVI believe it was one great philosopher who said \u2014
p302
aVno, no \u2014 Cervantes.
p303
aVCervantes said, "The journey is better than the end."
p304
aVAnd I like that.
p305
aVI think that it is \u2014 it's getting there.
p306
aVSometimes when you get there, there's almost a let down.
p307
aVBut it's the getting there that's the fun.
p308
aVAs a basketball coach at UCLA, I liked our practices to be the journey,
p309
aVand the game would be the end, the end result.
p310
aVI liked to go up and sit in the stands and watch the players play,
p311
aVand see whether I'd done a decent job during the week.
p312
aVThere again, it's getting the players to get that self-satisfaction,
p313
aVin knowing that they'd made the effort to do the best of which they are capable.
p314
aa(lp315
VSometimes I'm asked who was the best player I had, or the best teams.
p316
aVI can never answer that.
p317
aVAs far as the individuals are concerned \u2014
p318
aVI was asked one time about that,
p319
aVand they said,
p320
aV"Suppose that you, in some way, could make the perfect player.
p321
aVWhat would you want?"
p322
aVAnd I said, "Well, I'd want one that knew why he was at UCLA:
p323
aVto get an education, he was a good student,
p324
aVreally knew why he was there in the first place.
p325
aVBut I'd want one that could play, too.
p326
aVI'd want one to realize that defense usually wins championships,
p327
aVand who would work hard on defense.
p328
aVBut I'd want one who would play offense, too.
p329
aVI'd want him to be unselfish,
p330
aVand look for the pass first and not shoot all the time.
p331
aVAnd I'd want one that could pass and would pass.
p332
aa(lp333
V(Laughter)
p334
aa(lp335
VI've had some that could and wouldn't,
p336
aVand I've had some that would and could.
p337
aa(lp338
V(Laughter)
p339
aa(lp340
VSo, yeah, I'd want that.
p341
aa(lp342
VAnd I wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside.
p343
aVI wanted them to be good inside too.
p344
aa(lp345
V(Laughter)
p346
aa(lp347
VI'd want them to be able to rebound well at both ends, too.
p348
aVWhy not just take someone like Keith Wilkes and let it go at that.
p349
aVHe had the qualifications.
p350
aVNot the only one, but he was one that I used in that particular category,
p351
aVbecause I think he made the effort to become the best.
p352
aVThere was a couple.
p353
aa(lp354
VI mention in my book, "They Call Me Coach,"
p355
aVtwo players that gave me great satisfaction,
p356
aVthat came as close as I think anyone I ever had to reach their full potential:
p357
aVone was Conrad Burke, and one was Doug McIntosh.
p358
aVWhen I saw them as freshmen, on our freshmen team \u2014
p359
aVfreshmen couldn't play varsity when I taught.
p360
aVI thought, "Oh gracious, if these two players, either one of them" \u2014
p361
aVthey were different years, but I thought about each one at the time he was there \u2014
p362
aV"Oh, if he ever makes the varsity,
p363
aVour varsity must be pretty miserable, if he's good enough to make it."
p364
aVAnd you know, one of them was a starting player for a season and a half.
p365
aVThe other one, his next year, played 32 minutes in a national championship game,
p366
aVDid a tremendous job for us.
p367
aVThe next year, he was a starting player on the national championship team,
p368
aVand here I thought he'd never play a minute, when he was \u2014
p369
aVso those are the things that give you great joy,
p370
aVand great satisfaction to see.
p371
aa(lp372
VNeither one of those youngsters could shoot very well.
p373
aVBut they had outstanding shooting percentages,
p374
aVbecause they didn't force it.
p375
aVAnd neither one could jump very well,
p376
aVbut they kept good position, and so they did well rebounding.
p377
aVThey remembered that every shot that's taken, they assumed would be missed.
p378
aVI've had too many stand around and wait to see if it's missed,
p379
aVthen they go and it's too late, somebody else is in there ahead of them.
p380
aVThey weren't very quick, but they played good position,
p381
aVkept in good balance.
p382
aVAnd so they played pretty good defense for us.
p383
aVSo they had qualities that \u2014 they came close to \u2014
p384
aVas close to reaching possibly their full potential
p385
aVas any players I ever had.
p386
aVSo I consider them to be as successful as Lewis Alcindor or Bill Walton,
p387
aVor many of the others that we had;
p388
aVthere were some outstanding players.
p389
aa(lp390
VHave I rambled enough?
p391
aVI was told that when he makes his appearance, I was supposed to shut up.
