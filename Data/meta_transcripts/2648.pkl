VThis is a tuberculosis ward,
p4
aVand at the time this picture was taken in the late 1800s,
p5
aVone in seven of all people
p6
aVdied from tuberculosis.
p7
aVWe had no idea what was causing this disease.
p8
aVThe hypothesis was actually
p9
aVit was your constitution that made you susceptible.
p10
aVAnd it was a highly romanticized disease.
p11
aVIt was also called consumption,
p12
aVand it was the disorder of poets
p13
aVand artists and intellectuals.
p14
aVAnd some people actually thought it gave you heightened sensitivity
p15
aVand conferred creative genius.
p16
aa(lp17
VBy the 1950s,
p18
aVwe instead knew that tuberculosis was caused
p19
aVby a highly contagious bacterial infection,
p20
aVwhich is slightly less romantic,
p21
aVbut that had the upside
p22
aVof us being able to maybe develop drugs to treat it.
p23
aVSo doctors had discovered a new drug, iproniazid,
p24
aVthat they were optimistic might cure tuberculosis,
p25
aVand they gave it to patients,
p26
aVand patients were elated.
p27
aVThey were more social, more energetic.
p28
aVOne medical report actually says they were "dancing in the halls."
p29
aVAnd unfortunately,
p30
aVthis was not necessarily because they were getting better.
p31
aVA lot of them were still dying.
p32
aVAnother medical report describes them as being "inappropriately happy."
p33
aVAnd that is how the first antidepressant was discovered.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo accidental discovery is not uncommon in science,
p36
aVbut it requires more than just a happy accident.
p37
aVYou have to be able to recognize it for discovery to occur.
p38
aa(lp39
VAs a neuroscientist, I'm going to talk to you a little bit
p40
aVabout my firsthand experience
p41
aVwith whatever you want to call the opposite of dumb luck \u2014
p42
aVlet's call it smart luck.
p43
aVBut first, a bit more background.
p44
aa(lp45
VThankfully, since the 1950s,
p46
aVwe've developed some other drugs and we can actually now cure tuberculosis.
p47
aVAnd at least in the United States, though not necessarily in other countries,
p48
aVwe have closed our sanitoriums
p49
aVand probably most of you are not too worried about TB.
p50
aVBut a lot of what was true in the early 1900s
p51
aVabout infectious disease,
p52
aVwe can say now about psychiatric disorders.
p53
aa(lp54
VWe are in the middle of an epidemic of mood disorders
p55
aVlike depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.
p56
aVOne in four of all adults in the United States
p57
aVsuffers from mental illness,
p58
aVwhich means that if you haven't experienced it personally
p59
aVor someone in your family hasn't,
p60
aVit's still very likely that someone you know has,
p61
aVthough they may not talk about it.
p62
aVDepression has actually now surpassed
p63
aVHIV/AIDS, malaria, diabetes and war
p64
aVas the leading cause of disability worldwide.
p65
aVAnd also, like tuberculosis in the 1950s,
p66
aVwe don't know what causes it.
p67
aVOnce it's developed, it's chronic,
p68
aVlasts a lifetime,
p69
aVand there are no known cures.
p70
aa(lp71
VThe second antidepressant we discovered,
p72
aValso by accident, in the 1950s,
p73
aVfrom an antihistamine that was making people manic,
p74
aVimipramine.
p75
aVAnd in both the case of the tuberculosis ward and the antihistamine,
p76
aVsomeone had to be able to recognize
p77
aVthat a drug that was designed to do one thing \u2014
p78
aVtreat tuberculosis or suppress allergies \u2014
p79
aVcould be used to do something very different \u2014
p80
aVtreat depression.
p81
aVAnd this sort of repurposing is actually quite challenging.
p82
aVWhen doctors first saw this mood-enhancing effect of iproniazid,
p83
aVthey didn't really recognize what they saw.
p84
aVThey were so used to thinking about it
p85
aVfrom the framework of being a tuberculosis drug
p86
aVthat they actually just listed it
p87
aVas a side effect, an adverse side effect.
p88
aa(lp89
VAs you can see here,
p90
aVa lot of these patients in 1954 are experiencing severe euphoria.
p91
aVAnd they were worried that this might somehow interfere
p92
aVwith their recovering from tuberculosis.
p93
aVSo they recommended that iproniazid only be used in cases of extreme TB
p94
aVand in patients that were highly emotionally stable,
p95
aVwhich is of course the exact opposite of how we use it as an antidepressant.
p96
aVThey were so used to looking at it from the perspective of this one disease,
p97
aVthey could not see the larger implications for another disease.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd to be fair, it's not entirely their fault.
p100
aVFunctional fixedness is a bias that affects all of us.
p101
aVIt's a tendency to only be able to think of an object
p102
aVin terms of its traditional use or function.
p103
aVAnd mental set is another thing. Right?
p104
aVThat's sort of this preconceived framework
p105
aVwith which we approach problems.
p106
aVAnd that actually makes repurposing pretty hard for all of us,
p107
aVwhich is, I guess, why they gave a TV show to the guy who was,
p108
aVlike, really great at repurposing.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VSo the effects in both the case of iproniazid and imipramine,
p113
aVthey were so strong \u2014
p114
aVthere was mania, or people dancing in the halls.
p115
aVIt's actually not that surprising they were caught.
p116
aVBut it does make you wonder what else we've missed.
p117
aVSo iproniazid and imipramine,
p118
aVthey're more than just a case study in repurposing.
p119
aVThey have two other things in common that are really important.
p120
aVOne, they have terrible side effects.
p121
aVThat includes liver toxicity,
p122
aVweight gain of over 50 pounds,
p123
aVsuicidality.
p124
aVAnd two, they both increase levels of serotonin,
p125
aVwhich is a chemical signal in the brain,
p126
aVor a neurotransmitter.
p127
aVAnd those two things together, right, one or the two,
p128
aVmay not have been that important,
p129
aVbut the two together meant that we had to develop safer drugs,
p130
aVand that serotonin seemed like a pretty good place to start.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo we developed drugs to more specifically focus on serotonin,
p133
aVthe selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, so the SSRIs,
p134
aVthe most famous of which is Prozac.
p135
aVAnd that was 30 years ago,
p136
aVand since then we have mostly just worked on optimizing those drugs.
p137
aVAnd the SSRIs, they are better than the drugs that came before them,
p138
aVbut they still have a lot of side effects,
p139
aVincluding weight gain, insomnia,
p140
aVsuicidality \u2014
p141
aVand they take a really long time to work,
p142
aVsomething like four to six weeks in a lot of patients.
p143
aVAnd that's in the patients where they do work.
p144
aVThere are a lot of patients where these drugs don't work.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd that means now, in 2016,
p147
aVwe still have no cures for any mood disorders,
p148
aVjust drugs that suppress symptoms,
p149
aVwhich is kind of the difference between taking a painkiller for an infection
p150
aVversus an antibiotic.
p151
aVA painkiller will make you feel better,
p152
aVbut is not going to do anything to treat that underlying disease.
p153
aVAnd it was this flexibility in our thinking
p154
aVthat let us recognize that iproniazid and imipramine
p155
aVcould be repurposed in this way,
p156
aVwhich led us to the serotonin hypothesis,
p157
aVwhich we then, ironically, fixated on.
p158
aVThis is brain signaling, serotonin,
p159
aVfrom an SSRI commercial.
p160
aVIn case you're not clear, this is a dramatization.
p161
aVAnd in science, we try and remove our bias, right,
p162
aVby running double-blinded experiments
p163
aVor being statistically agnostic as to what our results will be.
p164
aVBut bias creeps in more insidiously in what we choose to study
p165
aVand how we choose to study it.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo we've focused on serotonin now for the past 30 years,
p168
aVoften to the exclusion of other things.
p169
aVWe still have no cures,
p170
aVand what if serotonin isn't all there is to depression?
p171
aVWhat if it's not even the key part of it?
p172
aVThat means no matter how much time
p173
aVor money or effort we put into it,
p174
aVit will never lead to a cure.
p175
aa(lp176
VIn the past few years, doctors have discovered
p177
aVprobably what is the first truly new antidepressant since the SSRIs,
p178
aVCalypsol,
p179
aVand this drug works very quickly, within a few hours or a day,
p180
aVand it doesn't work on serotonin.
p181
aVIt works on glutamate, which is another neurotransmitter.
p182
aVAnd it's also repurposed.
p183
aVIt was traditionally used as anesthesia in surgery.
p184
aVBut unlike those other drugs,
p185
aVwhich were recognized pretty quickly,
p186
aVit took us 20 years
p187
aVto realize that Calypsol was an antidepressant,
p188
aVdespite the fact that it's actually a better antidepressant,
p189
aVprobably, than those other drugs.
p190
aVIt's actually probably because of the fact that it's a better antidepressant
p191
aVthat it was harder for us to recognize.
p192
aVThere was no mania to signal its effects.
p193
aa(lp194
VSo in 2013, up at Columbia University,
p195
aVI was working with my colleague,
p196
aVDr. Christine Ann Denny,
p197
aVand we were studying Calypsol as an antidepressant in mice.
p198
aVAnd Calypsol has, like, a really short half-life,
p199
aVwhich means it's out of your body within a few hours.
p200
aVAnd we were just piloting.
p201
aVSo we would give an injection to mice,
p202
aVand then we'd wait a week,
p203
aVand then we'd run another experiment to save money.
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd one of the experiments I was running,
p206
aVwe would stress the mice,
p207
aVand we used that as a model of depression.
p208
aVAnd at first it kind of just looked like it didn't really work at all.
p209
aVSo we could have stopped there.
p210
aVBut I have run this model of depression for years,
p211
aVand the data just looked kind of weird.
p212
aVIt didn't really look right to me.
p213
aVSo I went back,
p214
aVand we reanalyzed it
p215
aVbased on whether or not they had gotten that one injection of Calypsol
p216
aVa week beforehand.
p217
aVAnd it looked kind of like this.
p218
aVSo if you look at the far left,
p219
aVif you put a mouse in a new space,
p220
aVthis is the box, it's very exciting,
p221
aVa mouse will walk around and explore,
p222
aVand you can see that pink line is actually the measure of them walking.
p223
aVAnd we also give it another mouse in a pencil cup
p224
aVthat it can decide to interact with.
p225
aVThis is also a dramatization, in case that's not clear.
p226
aVAnd a normal mouse will explore.
p227
aVIt will be social.
p228
aVCheck out what's going on.
p229
aVIf you stress a mouse in this depression model,
p230
aVwhich is the middle box,
p231
aVthey aren't social, they don't explore.
p232
aVThey mostly just kind of hide in that back corner, behind a cup.
p233
aVYet the mice that had gotten that one injection of Calypsol,
p234
aVhere on your right,
p235
aVthey were exploring, they were social.
p236
aVThey looked like they had never been stressed at all,
p237
aVwhich is impossible.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo we could have just stopped there,
p240
aVbut Christine had also used Calypsol before as anesthesia,
p241
aVand a few years ago she had seen
p242
aVthat it seemed to have some weird effects on cells
p243
aVand some other behavior
p244
aVthat also seemed to last long after the drug,
p245
aVmaybe a few weeks.
p246
aVSo we were like, OK,
p247
aVmaybe this is not completely impossible,
p248
aVbut we were really skeptical.
p249
aa(lp250
VSo we did what you do in science when you're not sure,
p251
aVand we ran it again.
p252
aVAnd I remember being in the animal room,
p253
aVmoving mice from box to box to test them,
p254
aVand Christine was actually sitting on the floor with the computer in her lap
p255
aVso the mice couldn't see her,
p256
aVand she was analyzing the data in real time.
p257
aVAnd I remember us yelling,
p258
aVwhich you're not supposed to do in an animal room where you're testing,
p259
aVbecause it had worked.
p260
aVIt seemed like these mice were protected against stress,
p261
aVor they were inappropriately happy, however you want to call it.
p262
aVAnd we were really excited.
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd then we were really skeptical, because it was too good to be true.
p265
aVSo we ran it again.
p266
aVAnd then we ran it again in a PTSD model,
p267
aVand we ran it again in a physiological model,
p268
aVwhere all we did was give stress hormones.
p269
aVAnd we had our undergrads run it.
p270
aVAnd then we had our collaborators halfway across the world in France run it.
p271
aVAnd every time someone ran it, they confirmed the same thing.
p272
aVIt seemed like this one injection of Calypsol
p273
aVwas somehow protecting against stress for weeks.
p274
aa(lp275
VAnd we only published this a year ago,
p276
aVbut since then other labs have independently confirmed this effect.
p277
aVSo we don't know what causes depression,
p278
aVbut we do know that stress is the initial trigger
p279
aVin 80 percent of cases,
p280
aVand depression and PTSD are different diseases,
p281
aVbut this is something they share in common.
p282
aVRight? It is traumatic stress
p283
aVlike active combat or natural disasters
p284
aVor community violence or sexual assault
p285
aVthat causes post-traumatic stress disorder,
p286
aVand not everyone that is exposed to stress develops a mood disorder.
p287
aVAnd this ability to experience stress and be resilient
p288
aVand bounce back and not develop depression or PTSD
p289
aVis known as stress resilience,
p290
aVand it varies between people.
p291
aVAnd we have always thought of it as just sort of this passive property.
p292
aVIt's the absence of susceptibility factors
p293
aVand risk factors for these disorders.
p294
aVBut what if it were active?
p295
aVMaybe we could enhance it,
p296
aVsort of akin to putting on armor.
p297
aa(lp298
VWe had accidentally discovered the first resilience-enhancing drug.
p299
aVAnd like I said, we only gave a tiny amount of the drug,
p300
aVand it lasted for weeks,
p301
aVand that's not like anything you see with antidepressants.
p302
aa(lp303
VBut it is actually kind of similar to what you see in immune vaccines.
p304
aVSo in immune vaccines, you'll get your shots,
p305
aVand then weeks, months, years later,
p306
aVwhen you're actually exposed to bacteria,
p307
aVit's not the vaccine in your body that protects you.
p308
aVIt's your own immune system
p309
aVthat's developed resistance and resilience to this bacteria that fights it off,
p310
aVand you actually never get the infection,
p311
aVwhich is very different from, say, our treatments. Right?
p312
aVIn that case, you get the infection, you're exposed to the bacteria,
p313
aVyou're sick, and then you take, say, an antibiotic which cures it,
p314
aVand those drugs are actually working to kill the bacteria.
p315
aVOr similar to as I said before, with this palliative,
p316
aVyou'll take something that will suppress the symptoms,
p317
aVbut it won't treat the underlying infection,
p318
aVand you'll only feel better during the time in which you're taking it,
p319
aVwhich is why you have to keep taking it.
p320
aVAnd in depression and PTSD \u2014
p321
aVhere we have your stress exposure \u2014
p322
aVwe only have palliative care.
p323
aVAntidepressants only suppress symptoms,
p324
aVand that is why you basically have to keep taking them
p325
aVfor the life of the disease,
p326
aVwhich is often the length of your own life.
p327
aa(lp328
VSo we're calling our resilience-enhancing drugs "paravaccines,"
p329
aVwhich means vaccine-like,
p330
aVbecause it seems like they might have the potential
p331
aVto protect against stress
p332
aVand prevent mice from developing
p333
aVdepression and post-traumatic stress disorder.
p334
aVAlso, not all antidepressants are also paravaccines.
p335
aVWe tried Prozac as well,
p336
aVand that had no effect.
p337
aa(lp338
VSo if this were to translate into humans,
p339
aVwe might be able to protect people
p340
aVwho are predictably at risk
p341
aVagainst stress-induced disorders like depression and PTSD.
p342
aVSo that's first responders and firefighters,
p343
aVrefugees, prisoners and prison guards,
p344
aVsoldiers, you name it.
p345
aa(lp346
VAnd to give you a sense of the scale of these diseases,
p347
aVin 2010, the global burden of disease
p348
aVwas estimated at 2.5 trillion dollars,
p349
aVand since they are chronic,
p350
aVthat cost is compounding and is therefore expected to rise
p351
aVup to six trillion dollars in just the next 15 years.
p352
aa(lp353
VAs I mentioned before,
p354
aVrepurposing can be challenging because of our prior biases.
p355
aVCalypsol has another name,
p356
aVketamine,
p357
aVwhich also goes by another name,
p358
aVSpecial K,
p359
aVwhich is a club drug and drug of abuse.
p360
aVIt's still used across the world as an anesthetic.
p361
aVIt's used in children. We use it on the battlefield.
p362
aVIt's actually the drug of choice in a lot of developing nations,
p363
aVbecause it doesn't affect breathing.
p364
aVIt is on the World Health Organization list of most essential medicines.
p365
aa(lp366
VIf we had discovered ketamine as a paravaccine first,
p367
aVit'd be pretty easy for us to develop it,
p368
aVbut as is, we have to compete with our functional fixedness
p369
aVand mental set that kind of interfere.
p370
aVFortunately, it's not the only compound we have discovered
p371
aVthat has these prophylactic, paravaccine qualities,
p372
aVbut all of the other drugs we've discovered,
p373
aVor compounds if you will, they're totally new,
p374
aVthey have to go through the entire FDA approval process \u2014
p375
aVif they make it before they can ever be used in humans.
p376
aVAnd that will be years.
p377
aVSo if we wanted something sooner,
p378
aVketamine is already FDA-approved.
p379
aVIt's generic, it's available.
p380
aVWe could develop it for a fraction of the price and a fraction of the time.
p381
aa(lp382
VBut actually, beyond functional fixedness and mental set,
p383
aVthere's a real other challenge to repurposing drugs,
p384
aVwhich is policy.
p385
aVThere are no incentives in place
p386
aVonce a drug is generic and off patent and no longer exclusive
p387
aVto encourage pharma companies to develop them,
p388
aVbecause they don't make money.
p389
aVAnd that's not true for just ketamine. That is true for all drugs.
p390
aVRegardless, the idea itself is completely novel in psychiatry,
p391
aVto use drugs to prevent mental illness
p392
aVas opposed to just treat it.
p393
aa(lp394
VIt is possible that 20, 50, 100 years from now,
p395
aVwe will look back now at depression and PTSD
p396
aVthe way we look back at tuberculosis sanitoriums
p397
aVas a thing of the past.
p398
aVThis could be the beginning of the end of the mental health epidemic.
p399
aa(lp400
VBut as a great scientist once said,
p401
aV"Only a fool is sure of anything.
p402
aVA wise man keeps on guessing."
