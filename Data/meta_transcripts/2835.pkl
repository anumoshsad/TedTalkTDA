VHow many companies have you interacted with today?
p4
aa(lp5
VWell, you got up in the morning,
p6
aVtook a shower,
p7
aVwashed your hair,
p8
aVused a hair dryer,
p9
aVate breakfast \u2014
p10
aVate cereals, fruit, yogurt, whatever \u2014
p11
aVhad coffee \u2014
p12
aVtea.
p13
aVYou took public transport to come here,
p14
aVor maybe used your private car.
p15
aVYou interacted with the company that you work for or that you own.
p16
aVYou interacted with your clients,
p17
aVyour customers,
p18
aVand so on and so forth.
p19
aVI'm pretty sure there are at least seven companies
p20
aVyou've interacted with today.
p21
aa(lp22
VLet me tell you a stunning statistic.
p23
aVOne out of seven large, public corporations
p24
aVcommit fraud every year.
p25
aVThis is a US academic study that looks at US companies \u2014
p26
aVI have no reason to believe that it's different in Europe.
p27
aVThis is a study that looks at both detected and undetected fraud
p28
aVusing statistical methods.
p29
aVThis is not petty fraud.
p30
aVThese frauds cost the shareholders of these companies,
p31
aVand therefore society,
p32
aVon the order of 380 billion dollars per year.
p33
aa(lp34
VWe can all think of some examples, right?
p35
aVThe car industry's secrets aren't quite so secret anymore.
p36
aVFraud has become a feature,
p37
aVnot a bug,
p38
aVof the financial services industry.
p39
aVThat's not me who's claiming that,
p40
aVthat's the president of the American Finance Association
p41
aVwho stated that in his presidential address.
p42
aVThat's a huge problem if you think about, especially,
p43
aVan economy like Switzerland,
p44
aVwhich relies so much on the trust put into its financial industry.
p45
aa(lp46
VOn the other hand,
p47
aVthere are six out of seven companies who actually remain honest
p48
aVdespite all temptations to start engaging in fraud.
p49
aVThere are whistle-blowers like Michael Woodford,
p50
aVwho blew the whistle on Olympus.
p51
aVThese whistle-blowers risk their careers,
p52
aVtheir friendships,
p53
aVto bring out the truth about their companies.
p54
aVThere are journalists like Anna Politkovskaya
p55
aVwho risk even their lives to report human rights violations.
p56
aVShe got killed \u2014
p57
aVevery year,
p58
aVaround 100 journalists get killed
p59
aVbecause of their conviction to bring out the truth.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo in my talk today,
p62
aVI want to share with you some insights I've obtained and learned
p63
aVin the last 10 years of conducting research in this.
p64
aVI'm a researcher, a scientist working with economists,
p65
aVfinancial economists,
p66
aVethicists, neuroscientists,
p67
aVlawyers and others
p68
aVtrying to understand what makes humans tick,
p69
aVand how can we address this issue of fraud in corporations
p70
aVand therefore contribute to the improvement of the world.
p71
aa(lp72
VI want to start by sharing with you two very distinct visions
p73
aVof how people behave.
p74
aVFirst, meet Adam Smith,
p75
aVfounding father of modern economics.
p76
aVHis basic idea was that if everybody behaves in their own self-interests,
p77
aVthat's good for everybody in the end.
p78
aVSelf-interest isn't a narrowly defined concept
p79
aVjust for your immediate utility.
p80
aVIt has a long-run implication.
p81
aVLet's think about that.
p82
aVThink about this dog here.
p83
aVThat might be us.
p84
aVThere's this temptation \u2014
p85
aVI apologize to all vegetarians, but \u2014
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VDogs do like the bratwurst.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aVNow, the straight-up, self-interested move here
p93
aVis to go for that.
p94
aVSo my friend Adam here might jump up,
p95
aVget the sausage and thereby ruin all this beautiful tableware.
p96
aVBut that's not what Adam Smith meant.
p97
aVHe didn't mean disregard all consequences \u2014
p98
aVto the contrary.
p99
aVHe would have thought,
p100
aVwell, there may be negative consequences,
p101
aVfor example,
p102
aVthe owner might be angry with the dog
p103
aVand the dog, anticipating that, might not behave in this way.
p104
aVThat might be us,
p105
aVweighing the benefits and costs of our actions.
p106
aa(lp107
VHow does that play out?
p108
aVWell, many of you, I'm sure,
p109
aVhave in your companies,
p110
aVespecially if it's a large company,
p111
aVa code of conduct.
p112
aVAnd then if you behave according to that code of conduct,
p113
aVthat improves your chances of getting a bonus payment.
p114
aVAnd on the other hand, if you disregard it,
p115
aVthen there are higher chances of not getting your bonus
p116
aVor its being diminished.
p117
aVIn other words,
p118
aVthis is a very economic motivation
p119
aVof trying to get people to be more honest,
p120
aVor more aligned with the corporation's principles.
p121
aa(lp122
VSimilarly, reputation is a very powerful economic force, right?
p123
aVWe try to build a reputation,
p124
aVmaybe for being honest,
p125
aVbecause then people trust us more in the future.
p126
aVRight?
p127
aVAdam Smith talked about the baker
p128
aVwho's not producing good bread out of his benevolence
p129
aVfor those people who consume the bread,
p130
aVbut because he wants to sell more future bread.
p131
aVIn my research, we find, for example,
p132
aVat the University of Zurich,
p133
aVthat Swiss banks who get caught up in media,
p134
aVand in the context, for example,
p135
aVof tax evasion, of tax fraud,
p136
aVhave bad media coverage.
p137
aVThey lose net new money in the future
p138
aVand therefore make lower profits.
p139
aVThat's a very powerful reputational force.
p140
aVBenefits and costs.
p141
aa(lp142
VHere's another viewpoint of the world.
p143
aVMeet Immanuel Kant,
p144
aV18th-century German philosopher superstar.
p145
aVHe developed this notion
p146
aVthat independent of the consequences,
p147
aVsome actions are just right
p148
aVand some are just wrong.
p149
aVIt's just wrong to lie, for example.
p150
aVSo, meet my friend Immanuel here.
p151
aVHe knows that the sausage is very tasty,
p152
aVbut he's going to turn away because he's a good dog.
p153
aVHe knows it's wrong to jump up
p154
aVand risk ruining all this beautiful tableware.
p155
aVIf you believe that people are motivated like that,
p156
aVthen all the stuff about incentives,
p157
aVall the stuff about code of conduct and bonus systems and so on,
p158
aVdoesn't make a whole lot of sense.
p159
aVPeople are motivated by different values perhaps.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo, what are people actually motivated by?
p162
aVThese two gentlemen here have perfect hairdos,
p163
aVbut they give us very different views of the world.
p164
aVWhat do we do with this?
p165
aVWell, I'm an economist
p166
aVand we conduct so-called experiments to address this issue.
p167
aVWe strip away facts which are confusing in reality.
p168
aVReality is so rich, there is so much going on,
p169
aVit's almost impossible to know what drives people's behavior really.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo let's do a little experiment together.
p172
aVImagine the following situation.
p173
aVYou're in a room alone,
p174
aVnot like here.
p175
aVThere's a five-franc coin like the one I'm holding up right now
p176
aVin front of you.
p177
aVHere are your instructions:
p178
aVtoss the coin four times,
p179
aVand then on a computer terminal in front of you,
p180
aVenter the number of times tails came up.
p181
aVThis is the situation.
p182
aVHere's the rub.
p183
aVFor every time that you announce that you had a tails throw,
p184
aVyou get paid five francs.
p185
aVSo if you say I had two tails throws,
p186
aVyou get paid 10 francs.
p187
aVIf you say you had zero, you get paid zero francs.
p188
aVIf you say, "I had four tails throws,"
p189
aVthen you get paid 20 francs.
p190
aVIt's anonymous,
p191
aVnobody's watching what you're doing,
p192
aVand you get paid that money anonymously.
p193
aa(lp194
VI've got two questions for you.
p195
aa(lp196
V(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
VYou know what's coming now, right?
p199
aVFirst, how would you behave in that situation?
p200
aVThe second, look to your left and look to your right \u2014
p201
aa(lp202
V(Laughter)
p203
aa(lp204
Vand think about how the person sitting next to you
p205
aVmight behave in that situation.
p206
aa(lp207
VWe did this experiment for real.
p208
aVWe did it at the Manifesta art exhibition
p209
aVthat took place here in Zurich recently,
p210
aVnot with students in the lab at the university
p211
aVbut with the real population,
p212
aVlike you guys.
p213
aVFirst, a quick reminder of stats.
p214
aVIf I throw the coin four times and it's a fair coin,
p215
aVthen the probability that it comes up four times tails
p216
aVis 6.25 percent.
p217
aVAnd I hope you can intuitively see
p218
aVthat the probability that all four of them are tails is much lower
p219
aVthan if two of them are tails, right?
p220
aa(lp221
VHere are the specific numbers.
p222
aVHere's what happened.
p223
aVPeople did this experiment for real.
p224
aVAround 30 to 35 percent of people said,
p225
aV"Well, I had four tails throws."
p226
aVThat's extremely unlikely.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VBut the really amazing thing here,
p231
aVperhaps to an economist,
p232
aVis there are around 65 percent of people who did not say I had four tails throws,
p233
aVeven though in that situation,
p234
aVnobody's watching you,
p235
aVthe only consequence that's in place
p236
aVis you get more money if you say four than less.
p237
aVYou leave 20 francs on the table by announcing zero.
p238
aVI don't know whether the other people all were honest
p239
aVor whether they also said a little bit higher or lower than what they did
p240
aVbecause it's anonymous.
p241
aVWe only observed the distribution.
p242
aVBut what I can tell you \u2014 and here's another coin toss.
p243
aVThere you go, it's tails.
p244
aa(lp245
V(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
VDon't check, OK?
p248
aa(lp249
V(Laughter)
p250
aa(lp251
VWhat I can tell you
p252
aVis that not everybody behaved like Adam Smith would have predicted.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo what does that leave us with?
p255
aVWell, it seems people are motivated by certain intrinsic values
p256
aVand in our research, we look at this.
p257
aVWe look at the idea that people have so-called protected values.
p258
aVA protected value isn't just any value.
p259
aVA protected value is a value where you're willing to pay a price
p260
aVto uphold that value.
p261
aVYou're willing to pay a price to withstand the temptation to give in.
p262
aVAnd the consequence is you feel better
p263
aVif you earn money in a way that's consistent with your values.
p264
aa(lp265
VLet me show you this again in the metaphor of our beloved dog here.
p266
aVIf we succeed in getting the sausage without violating our values,
p267
aVthen the sausage tastes better.
p268
aVThat's what our research shows.
p269
aVIf, on the other hand,
p270
aVwe do so \u2014
p271
aVif we get the sausage
p272
aVand in doing so we actually violate values,
p273
aVwe value the sausage less.
p274
aVQuantitatively, that's quite powerful.
p275
aVWe can measure these protected values,
p276
aVfor example,
p277
aVby a survey measure.
p278
aVSimple, nine-item survey that's quite predictive in these experiments.
p279
aVIf you think about the average of the population
p280
aVand then there's a distribution around it \u2014
p281
aVpeople are different, we all are different.
p282
aVPeople who have a set of protected values
p283
aVthat's one standard deviation above the average,
p284
aVthey discount money they receive by lying by about 25 percent.
p285
aVThat means a dollar received when lying
p286
aVis worth to them only 75 cents
p287
aVwithout any incentives you put in place for them to behave honestly.
p288
aVIt's their intrinsic motivation.
p289
aa(lp290
VBy the way, I'm not a moral authority.
p291
aVI'm not saying I have all these beautiful values, right?
p292
aVBut I'm interested in how people behave
p293
aVand how we can leverage that richness in human nature
p294
aVto actually improve the workings of our organizations.
p295
aa(lp296
VSo there are two very, very different visions here.
p297
aVOn the one hand,
p298
aVyou can appeal to benefits and costs
p299
aVand try to get people to behave according to them.
p300
aVOn the other hand,
p301
aVyou can select people who have the values
p302
aVand the desirable characteristics, of course \u2014
p303
aVcompetencies that go in line with your organization.
p304
aa(lp305
VI do not yet know where these protected values really come from.
p306
aVIs it nurture or is it nature?
p307
aVWhat I can tell you
p308
aVis that the distribution looks pretty similar for men and women.
p309
aVIt looks pretty similar for those who had studied economics
p310
aVor those who had studied psychology.
p311
aVIt looks even pretty similar around different age categories
p312
aVamong adults.
p313
aVBut I don't know yet how this develops over a lifetime.
p314
aVThat will be the subject of future research.
p315
aa(lp316
VThe idea I want to leave you with
p317
aVis it's all right to appeal to incentives.
p318
aVI'm an economist;
p319
aVI certainly believe in the fact that incentives work.
p320
aVBut do think about selecting the right people
p321
aVrather than having people and then putting incentives in place.
p322
aVSelecting the right people with the right values
p323
aVmay go a long way to saving a lot of trouble
p324
aVand a lot of money
p325
aVin your organizations.
p326
aVIn other words,
p327
aVit will pay off to put people first.
p328
aa(lp329
VThank you.
