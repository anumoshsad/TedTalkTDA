VWhat I'm going to do, in the spirit of collaborative creativity,
p4
aVis simply repeat many of the points
p5
aVthat the three people before me have already made,
p6
aVbut do them \u2014
p7
aVthis is called "creative collaboration;"
p8
aVit's actually called "borrowing" \u2014
p9
aVbut do it through a particular perspective,
p10
aVand that is to ask about the role of users and consumers
p11
aVin this emerging world of
p12
aVcollaborative creativity
p13
aVthat Jimmy and others have talked about.
p14
aa(lp15
VLet me just ask you, to start with,
p16
aVthis simple question:
p17
aVwho invented the mountain bike?
p18
aVBecause traditional economic theory would say,
p19
aVwell, the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation
p20
aVthat had a big R&D lab
p21
aVwhere they were thinking up new projects,
p22
aVand it came out of there. It didn't come from there.
p23
aVAnother answer might be, well, it came from a sort of lone genius
p24
aVworking in his garage, who,
p25
aVworking away on different kinds of bikes, comes up
p26
aVwith a bike out of thin air.
p27
aa(lp28
VIt didn't come from there. The mountain bike
p29
aVcame from users, came from young users,
p30
aVparticularly a group in Northern California,
p31
aVwho were frustrated with traditional racing bikes,
p32
aVwhich were those sort of bikes that Eddy Merckx rode,
p33
aVor your big brother, and they're very glamorous.
p34
aVBut also frustrated with the bikes that your dad rode,
p35
aVwhich sort of had big handlebars like that, and they were too heavy.
p36
aVSo, they got the frames from these big bikes,
p37
aVput them together with the gears from the racing bikes,
p38
aVgot the brakes from motorcycles,
p39
aVand sort of mixed and matched various ingredients.
p40
aVAnd for the first, I don't know, three to five years of their life,
p41
aVmountain bikes were known as "clunkers."
p42
aVAnd they were just made in a community of bikers,
p43
aVmainly in Northern California.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd then one of these companies that was importing parts
p46
aVfor the clunkers decided to set up in business,
p47
aVstart selling them to other people,
p48
aVand gradually another company emerged out of that, Marin,
p49
aVand it probably was, I don't know,
p50
aV10, maybe even 15, years,
p51
aVbefore the big bike companies
p52
aVrealized there was a market.
p53
aVThirty years later,
p54
aVmountain bike sales
p55
aVand mountain bike equipment
p56
aVaccount for 65 percent of bike sales in America.
p57
aVThat's 58 billion dollars.
p58
aa(lp59
VThis is a category entirely created by consumers
p60
aVthat would not have been created by the mainstream bike market
p61
aVbecause they couldn't see the need,
p62
aVthe opportunity;
p63
aVthey didn't have the incentive to innovate.
p64
aVThe one thing I think I disagree with
p65
aVabout Yochai's presentation
p66
aVis when he said the Internet causes
p67
aVthis distributive capacity for innovation to come alive.
p68
aVIt's when the Internet combines
p69
aVwith these kinds of passionate pro-am consumers \u2014
p70
aVwho are knowledgeable; they've got the incentive to innovate;
p71
aVthey've got the tools; they want to \u2014
p72
aVthat you get this kind of explosion
p73
aVof creative collaboration.
p74
aVAnd out of that, you get the need for the kind of things
p75
aVthat Jimmy was talking about, which is our new kinds of organization,
p76
aVor a better way to put it:
p77
aVhow do we organize ourselves without organizations?
p78
aVThat's now possible; you don't need an organization to be organized,
p79
aVto achieve large and complex tasks,
p80
aVlike innovating new software programs.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo this is a huge challenge
p83
aVto the way we think creativity comes about.
p84
aVThe traditional view, still enshrined
p85
aVin much of the way that we think about creativity
p86
aV\u2014 in organizations, in government \u2014
p87
aVis that creativity is about special people:
p88
aVwear baseball caps the wrong way round,
p89
aVcome to conferences like this, in special places,
p90
aVelite universities, R&D labs in the forests, water,
p91
aVmaybe special rooms in companies painted funny colors,
p92
aVyou know, bean bags, maybe the odd table-football table.
p93
aVSpecial people, special places, think up special ideas,
p94
aVthen you have a pipeline that takes the ideas
p95
aVdown to the waiting consumers, who are passive.
p96
aVThey can say "yes" or "no" to the invention.
p97
aVThat's the idea of creativity.
p98
aVWhat's the policy recommendation out of that
p99
aVif you're in government, or you're running a large company?
p100
aVMore special people, more special places.
p101
aVBuild creative clusters in cities;
p102
aVcreate more R&D parks, so on and so forth.
p103
aVExpand the pipeline down to the consumers.
p104
aa(lp105
VWell this view, I think, is increasingly wrong.
p106
aVI think it's always been wrong,
p107
aVbecause I think always creativity has been highly collaborative,
p108
aVand it's probably been largely interactive.
p109
aVBut it's increasingly wrong, and one of the reasons it's wrong
p110
aVis that the ideas are flowing back up the pipeline.
p111
aVThe ideas are coming back from the consumers,
p112
aVand they're often ahead of the producers.
p113
aVWhy is that?
p114
aVWell, one issue
p115
aVis that radical innovation,
p116
aVwhen you've got ideas that
p117
aVaffect a large number of technologies or people,
p118
aVhave a great deal of uncertainty attached to them.
p119
aVThe payoffs to innovation are greatest
p120
aVwhere the uncertainty is highest.
p121
aVAnd when you get a radical innovation,
p122
aVit's often very uncertain how it can be applied.
p123
aa(lp124
VThe whole history of telephony
p125
aVis a story of dealing with that uncertainty.
p126
aVThe very first landline telephones,
p127
aVthe inventors thought
p128
aVthat they would be used for people to listen in
p129
aVto live performances
p130
aVfrom West End theaters.
p131
aVWhen the mobile telephone companies invented SMS,
p132
aVthey had no idea what it was for;
p133
aVit was only when that technology got into the hands
p134
aVof teenage users
p135
aVthat they invented the use.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo the more radical the innovation,
p138
aVthe more the uncertainty,
p139
aVthe more you need innovation in use
p140
aVto work out what a technology is for.
p141
aVAll of our patents, our entire approach
p142
aVto patents and invention, is based on the idea
p143
aVthat the inventor knows what the invention is for;
p144
aVwe can say what it's for.
p145
aVMore and more, the inventors of things
p146
aVwill not be able to say that in advance.
p147
aVIt will be worked out in use,
p148
aVin collaboration with users.
p149
aVWe like to think that invention is
p150
aVa sort of moment of creation:
p151
aVthere is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea.
p152
aVThe truth is that most creativity
p153
aVis cumulative and collaborative;
p154
aVlike Wikipedia, it develops over a long period of time.
p155
aa(lp156
VThe second reason why users are more and more important
p157
aVis that they are the source of big, disruptive innovations.
p158
aVIf you want to find the big new ideas,
p159
aVit's often difficult to find them in mainstream markets,
p160
aVin big organizations.
p161
aVAnd just look inside large organizations
p162
aVand you'll see why that is so.
p163
aVSo, you're in a big corporation.
p164
aVYou're obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder.
p165
aVDo you go into your board and say,
p166
aV"Look, I've got a fantastic idea
p167
aVfor an embryonic product
p168
aVin a marginal market,
p169
aVwith consumers we've never dealt with before,
p170
aVand I'm not sure it's going to have a big payoff, but it could be really, really big in the future?"
p171
aVNo, what you do, is you go in and you say,
p172
aV"I've got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovation
p173
aVto an existing product we sell through existing channels
p174
aVto existing users, and I can guarantee
p175
aVyou get this much return out of it over the next three years."
p176
aa(lp177
VBig corporations have an in-built tendency
p178
aVto reinforce past success.
p179
aVThey've got so much sunk in it
p180
aVthat it's very difficult for them to spot
p181
aVemerging new markets. Emerging new markets, then,
p182
aVare the breeding grounds for passionate users.
p183
aVBest example:
p184
aVwho in the music industry,
p185
aV30 years ago, would have said,
p186
aV"Yes, let's invent a musical form
p187
aVwhich is all about dispossessed black men
p188
aVin ghettos expressing their frustration
p189
aVwith the world through a form of music
p190
aVthat many people find initially quite difficult to listen to.
p191
aVThat sounds like a winner; we'll go with it."
p192
aV(Laughter).
p193
aVSo what happens? Rap music is created by the users.
p194
aVThey do it on their own tapes, with their own recording equipment;
p195
aVthey distribute it themselves.
p196
aV30 years later,
p197
aVrap music is the dominant musical form of popular culture \u2014
p198
aVwould never have come from the big companies.
p199
aVHad to start \u2014 this is the third point \u2014
p200
aVwith these pro-ams.
p201
aa(lp202
VThis is the phrase that I've used in
p203
aVsome stuff which I've done
p204
aVwith a think tank in London called Demos,
p205
aVwhere we've been looking at these people who are amateurs \u2014
p206
aVi.e., they do it for the love of it \u2014
p207
aVbut they want to do it to very high standards.
p208
aVAnd across a whole range of fields \u2014
p209
aVfrom software, astronomy,
p210
aVnatural sciences,
p211
aVvast areas of leisure and culture
p212
aVlike kite-surfing, so on and so forth \u2014
p213
aVyou find people who want to do things because they love it,
p214
aVbut they want to do these things to very high standards.
p215
aVThey work at their leisure, if you like.
p216
aVThey take their leisure very seriously:
p217
aVthey acquire skills; they invest time;
p218
aVthey use technology that's getting cheaper \u2014 it's not just the Internet:
p219
aVcameras, design technology,
p220
aVleisure technology, surfboards, so on and so forth.
p221
aVLargely through globalization,
p222
aVa lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper.
p223
aVMore knowledgeable consumers, more educated,
p224
aVmore able to connect with one another,
p225
aVmore able to do things together.
p226
aVConsumption, in that sense, is an expression
p227
aVof their productive potential.
p228
aVWhy, we found, people were interested in this,
p229
aVis that at work they don't feel very expressed.
p230
aVThey don't feel as if they're doing something that really matters to them,
p231
aVso they pick up these kinds of activities.
p232
aVThis has huge organizational implications
p233
aVfor very large areas of life.
p234
aa(lp235
VTake astronomy as an example,
p236
aVwhich Yochai has already mentioned.
p237
aVTwenty years ago, 30 years ago,
p238
aVonly big professional astronomers
p239
aVwith very big telescopes could see far into space.
p240
aVAnd there's a big telescope in Northern England called Jodrell Bank,
p241
aVand when I was a kid, it was amazing,
p242
aVbecause the moon shots would take off, and this thing would move on rails.
p243
aVAnd it was huge \u2014 it was absolutely enormous.
p244
aVNow, six
p245
aVamateur astronomers, working with the Internet,
p246
aVwith Dobsonian digital telescopes \u2014
p247
aVwhich are pretty much open source \u2014
p248
aVwith some light sensors
p249
aVdeveloped over the last 10 years, the Internet \u2014
p250
aVthey can do what Jodrell Bank could only do 30 years ago.
p251
aVSo here in astronomy, you have this vast explosion
p252
aVof new productive resources.
p253
aVThe users can be producers.
p254
aa(lp255
VWhat does this mean, then, for our
p256
aVorganizational landscape?
p257
aVWell, just imagine a world,
p258
aVfor the moment, divided into two camps.
p259
aVOver here, you've got the old, traditional corporate model:
p260
aVspecial people, special places;
p261
aVpatent it, push it down the pipeline
p262
aVto largely waiting, passive consumers.
p263
aVOver here, let's imagine we've got
p264
aVWikipedia, Linux, and beyond \u2014 open source.
p265
aVThis is open; this is closed.
p266
aVThis is new; this is traditional.
p267
aVWell, the first thing you can say, I think with certainty,
p268
aVis what Yochai has said already \u2014
p269
aVis there is a great big struggle
p270
aVbetween those two organizational forms.
p271
aVThese people over there will do everything they can
p272
aVto stop these kinds of organizations succeeding,
p273
aVbecause they're threatened by them.
p274
aVAnd so the debates about
p275
aVcopyright, digital rights, so on and so forth \u2014
p276
aVthese are all about trying to stifle, in my view,
p277
aVthese kinds of organizations.
p278
aVWhat we're seeing is a complete corruption
p279
aVof the idea of patents and copyright.
p280
aVMeant to be a way to incentivize invention,
p281
aVmeant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge,
p282
aVthey are increasingly being used by large companies
p283
aVto create thickets of patents
p284
aVto prevent innovation taking place.
p285
aa(lp286
VLet me just give you two examples.
p287
aVThe first is: imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist
p288
aVand saying, "I've got a fantastic idea.
p289
aVI've invented this brilliant new program
p290
aVthat is much, much better than Microsoft Outlook."
p291
aVWhich venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture
p292
aVcompeting with Microsoft, with Microsoft Outlook? No one.
p293
aVThat is why the competition with Microsoft is bound to come \u2014
p294
aVwill only come \u2014
p295
aVfrom an open-source kind of project.
p296
aa(lp297
VSo, there is a huge competitive argument
p298
aVabout sustaining the capacity
p299
aVfor open-source and consumer-driven innovation,
p300
aVbecause it's one of the greatest
p301
aVcompetitive levers against monopoly.
p302
aVThere'll be huge professional arguments as well.
p303
aVBecause the professionals, over here
p304
aVin these closed organizations \u2014
p305
aVthey might be academics; they might be programmers;
p306
aVthey might be doctors; they might be journalists \u2014
p307
aVmy former profession \u2014
p308
aVsay, "No, no \u2014 you can't trust these people over here."
p309
aa(lp310
VWhen I started in journalism \u2014
p311
aVFinancial Times, 20 years ago \u2014
p312
aVit was very, very exciting
p313
aVto see someone reading the newspaper.
p314
aVAnd you'd kind of look over their shoulder on the Tube
p315
aVto see if they were reading your article.
p316
aVUsually they were reading the share prices,
p317
aVand the bit of the paper with your article on
p318
aVwas on the floor, or something like that,
p319
aVand you know, "For heaven's sake, what are they doing!
p320
aVThey're not reading my brilliant article!"
p321
aVAnd we allowed users, readers,
p322
aVtwo places where they could contribute to the paper:
p323
aVthe letters page, where they could write a letter in,
p324
aVand we would condescend to them, cut it in half,
p325
aVand print it three days later.
p326
aVOr the op-ed page, where if they knew the editor \u2014
p327
aVhad been to school with him, slept with his wife \u2014
p328
aVthey could write an article for the op-ed page.
p329
aVThose were the two places.
p330
aa(lp331
VShock, horror: now, the readers want to be writers and publishers.
p332
aVThat's not their role; they're supposed to read what we write.
p333
aVBut they don't want to be journalists. The journalists think
p334
aVthat the bloggers want to be journalists;
p335
aVthey don't want to be journalists; they just want to have a voice.
p336
aVThey want to, as Jimmy said, they want to have a dialogue, a conversation.
p337
aVThey want to be part of that flow of information.
p338
aVWhat's happening there is that the whole domain
p339
aVof creativity is expanding.
p340
aVSo, there's going to be a tremendous struggle.
p341
aVBut, also, there's going to be tremendous movement
p342
aVfrom the open to the closed.
p343
aa(lp344
VWhat you'll see, I think, is two things that are critical,
p345
aVand these, I think, are two challenges
p346
aVfor the open movement.
p347
aVThe first is:
p348
aVcan we really survive on volunteers?
p349
aVIf this is so critical,
p350
aVdo we not need it funded, organized, supported
p351
aVin much more structured ways?
p352
aVI think the idea of creating the Red Cross
p353
aVfor information and knowledge is a fantastic idea,
p354
aVbut can we really organize that, just on volunteers?
p355
aVWhat kind of changes do we need in public policy
p356
aVand funding to make that possible?
p357
aVWhat's the role of the BBC,
p358
aVfor instance, in that world?
p359
aVWhat should be the role of public policy?
p360
aVAnd finally, what I think you will see
p361
aVis the intelligent, closed organizations
p362
aVmoving increasingly in the open direction.
p363
aVSo it's not going to be a contest between two camps,
p364
aVbut, in between them, you'll find all sorts of interesting places
p365
aVthat people will occupy.
p366
aVNew organizational models coming about,
p367
aVmixing closed and open in tricky ways.
p368
aVIt won't be so clear-cut; it won't be Microsoft versus Linux \u2014
p369
aVthere'll be all sorts of things in between.
p370
aVAnd those organizational models, it turns out,
p371
aVare incredibly powerful,
p372
aVand the people who can understand them
p373
aVwill be very, very successful.
p374
aa(lp375
VLet me just give you one final example
p376
aVof what that means.
p377
aVI was in Shanghai,
p378
aVin an office block
p379
aVbuilt on what was a rice paddy five years ago \u2014
p380
aVone of the 2,500 skyscrapers
p381
aVthey've built in Shanghai in the last 10 years.
p382
aVAnd I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan.
p383
aVTimothy Chan set up an Internet business
p384
aVin 2000.
p385
aVDidn't go into the Internet, kept his money,
p386
aVdecided to go into computer games.
p387
aVHe runs a company called Shanda,
p388
aVwhich is the largest computer games company in China.
p389
aVNine thousand servers all over China,
p390
aVhas 250 million subscribers.
p391
aVAt any one time, there are four million people playing one of his games.
p392
aVHow many people does he employ
p393
aVto service that population?
p394
aV500 people.
p395
aVWell, how can he service
p396
aV250 million people from 500 employees?
p397
aVBecause basically, he doesn't service them.
p398
aVHe gives them a platform;
p399
aVhe gives them some rules; he gives them the tools
p400
aVand then he kind of orchestrates the conversation;
p401
aVhe orchestrates the action.
p402
aVBut actually, a lot of the content
p403
aVis created by the users themselves.
p404
aVAnd it creates a kind of stickiness
p405
aVbetween the community and the company
p406
aVwhich is really, really powerful.
p407
aa(lp408
VThe best measure of that: so you go into one of his games,
p409
aVyou create a character
p410
aVthat you develop in the course of the game.
p411
aVIf, for some reason, your credit card bounces,
p412
aVor there's some other problem,
p413
aVyou lose your character.
p414
aVYou've got two options.
p415
aVOne option: you can create a new character,
p416
aVright from scratch, but with none of the history of your player.
p417
aVThat costs about 100 dollars.
p418
aVOr you can get on a plane, fly to Shanghai,
p419
aVqueue up outside Shanda's offices \u2014
p420
aVcost probably 600, 700 dollars \u2014
p421
aVand reclaim your character, get your history back.
p422
aVEvery morning, there are 600 people queuing
p423
aVoutside their offices
p424
aVto reclaim these characters. (Laughter)
p425
aVSo this is about companies built on communities,
p426
aVthat provide communities with tools,
p427
aVresources, platforms in which they can share.
p428
aVHe's not open source,
p429
aVbut it's very, very powerful.
p430
aa(lp431
VSo here is one of the challenges, I think,
p432
aVfor people like me, who
p433
aVdo a lot of work with government.
p434
aVIf you're a games company,
p435
aVand you've got a million players in your game,
p436
aVyou only need one percent of them
p437
aVto be co-developers, contributing ideas,
p438
aVand you've got a development workforce
p439
aVof 10,000 people.
p440
aVImagine you could take all the children
p441
aVin education in Britain, and one percent of them
p442
aVwere co-developers of education.
p443
aVWhat would that do to the resources available
p444
aVto the education system?
