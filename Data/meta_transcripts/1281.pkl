VLet me introduce to you Rezero.
p4
aVThis little fellow was developed
p5
aVby a group of 10 undergraduate students
p6
aVat the Autonomous Systems Laboratory
p7
aVat ETH-Zurich.
p8
aa(lp9
VOur robot belongs to a family of robots
p10
aVcalled Ballbots.
p11
aVInstead of wheels, a Ballbot is balancing
p12
aVand moving on one single ball.
p13
aVThe main characteristics of such a system is
p14
aVthat there's one sole contact point to the ground.
p15
aVThis means that the robot
p16
aVis inherently unstable.
p17
aVIt's like when I am trying to stand
p18
aVon one foot.
p19
aa(lp20
VYou might ask yourself, what's the usefulness
p21
aVof a robot that's unstable?
p22
aVNow we'll explain that in a second.
p23
aVLet me first explain how Rezero
p24
aVactually keeps his balance.
p25
aVRezero keeps his balance by constantly
p26
aVmeasuring his pitch angle with a sensor.
p27
aVHe then counteracts and avoids toppling over
p28
aVby turning the motors appropriately.
p29
aVThis happens 160 times per second,
p30
aVand if anything fails in this process,
p31
aVRezero would immediately fall to the ground.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow to move and to balance,
p34
aVRezero needs to turn the ball.
p35
aVThe ball is driven by three special wheels
p36
aVthat allow Rezero to move into any direction
p37
aVand also move around his own axis
p38
aVat the same time.
p39
aVDue to his instability, Rezero is always
p40
aVin motion. Now here's the trick.
p41
aVIt's indeed exactly this instability that allows
p42
aVa robot to move very [dynamically].
p43
aVLet's play a little.
p44
aVYou may have wondered what happens
p45
aVif I give the robot a little push.
p46
aVIn this mode, he's trying to maintain
p47
aVhis position.
p48
aa(lp49
VFor the next demo, I'd like you to introduce
p50
aVto my colleagues Michael, on the computer,
p51
aVand Thomas who's helping me onstage.
p52
aVIn the next mode, Rezero is passive,
p53
aVand we can move him around.
p54
aVWith almost no force I can control
p55
aVhis position and his velocity.
p56
aVI can also make him spin.
p57
aVIn the next mode, we can get Rezero
p58
aVto follow a person.
p59
aVHe's now keeping a constant distance to Thomas.
p60
aVThis works with a laser sensor
p61
aVthat's mounted on top of Rezero.
p62
aVWith the same method, we can also
p63
aVget him to circle a person.
p64
aVWe call this the orbiting mode.
p65
aVAll right, thank you, Thomas.
p66
aV(Applause)
p67
aa(lp68
VNow, what's the use of this technology?
p69
aVFor now, it's an experiment, but let me
p70
aVshow you some possible future applications.
p71
aVRezero could be used in exhibitions or parks.
p72
aVWith a screen it could inform people or show
p73
aVthem around in a fun and entertaining way.
p74
aVIn a hospital, this device could be used to
p75
aVcarry around medical equipment.
p76
aVDue to the Ballbot system, it has a very small
p77
aVfootprint and it's also easy to move around.
p78
aVAnd of course, who wouldn't like
p79
aVto take a ride on one of these.
p80
aVAnd these are more practical applications.
p81
aVBut there's also a certain beauty
p82
aVwithin this technology.
