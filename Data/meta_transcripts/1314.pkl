VThere's a poem written
p4
aVby a very famous English poet
p5
aVat the end of the 19th century.
p6
aVIt was said to echo in Churchill's brain
p7
aVin the 1930s.
p8
aVAnd the poem goes:
p9
aV"On the idle hill of summer,
p10
aVlazy with the flow of streams,
p11
aVhark I hear a distant drummer,
p12
aVdrumming like a sound in dreams,
p13
aVfar and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by,
p14
aVdear to friend and food to powder,
p15
aVsoldiers marching,
p16
aVsoon to die."
p17
aVThose who are interested in poetry,
p18
aVthe poem is "A Shropshire Lad" written by A.E. Housman.
p19
aa(lp20
VBut what Housman understood,
p21
aVand you hear it in the symphonies of Nielsen too,
p22
aVwas that the long, hot, silvan summers
p23
aVof stability of the 19th century
p24
aVwere coming to a close,
p25
aVand that we were about to move
p26
aVinto one of those terrifying periods of history
p27
aVwhen power changes.
p28
aVAnd these are always periods, ladies and gentlemen,
p29
aVaccompanied by turbulence,
p30
aVand all too often by blood.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd my message for you
p33
aVis that I believe we are condemned, if you like,
p34
aVto live at just one of those moments in history
p35
aVwhen the gimbals upon which
p36
aVthe established order of power is beginning to change
p37
aVand the new look of the world,
p38
aVthe new powers that exist in the world,
p39
aVare beginning to take form.
p40
aVAnd these are \u2014 and we see it very clearly today \u2014
p41
aVnearly always highly turbulent times, highly difficult times,
p42
aVand all too often very bloody times.
p43
aVBy the way, it happens about once every century.
p44
aa(lp45
VYou might argue that the last time it happened \u2014
p46
aVand that's what Housman felt coming and what Churchill felt too \u2014
p47
aVwas that when power passed from the old nations,
p48
aVthe old powers of Europe,
p49
aVacross the Atlantic to the new emerging power
p50
aVof the United States of America \u2014
p51
aVthe beginning of the American century.
p52
aVAnd of course, into the vacuum
p53
aVwhere the too-old European powers used to be
p54
aVwere played the two bloody catastrophes
p55
aVof the last century \u2014
p56
aVthe one in the first part and the one in the second part: the two great World Wars.
p57
aVMao Zedong used to refer to them as the European civil wars,
p58
aVand it's probably a more accurate way of describing them.
p59
aa(lp60
VWell, ladies and gentlemen,
p61
aVwe live at one of those times.
p62
aVBut for us, I want to talk about three factors today.
p63
aVAnd the first of these, the first two of these,
p64
aVis about a shift in power.
p65
aVAnd the second is about some new dimension which I want to refer to,
p66
aVwhich has never quite happened in the way it's happening now.
p67
aVBut let's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world.
p68
aVAnd what is happening today
p69
aVis, in one sense, frightening
p70
aVbecause it's never happened before.
p71
aVWe have seen lateral shifts of power \u2014
p72
aVthe power of Greece passed to Rome
p73
aVand the power shifts that occurred
p74
aVduring the European civilizations \u2014
p75
aVbut we are seeing something slightly different.
p76
aVFor power is not just moving laterally
p77
aVfrom nation to nation.
p78
aVIt's also moving vertically.
p79
aa(lp80
VWhat's happening today is that the power that was encased,
p81
aVheld to accountability, held to the rule of law,
p82
aVwithin the institution of the nation state
p83
aVhas now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage.
p84
aVThe globalization of power \u2014
p85
aVwe talk about the globalization of markets,
p86
aVbut actually it's the globalization of real power.
p87
aVAnd where, at the nation state level
p88
aVthat power is held to accountability
p89
aVsubject to the rule of law,
p90
aVon the international stage it is not.
p91
aVThe international stage and the global stage where power now resides:
p92
aVthe power of the Internet, the power of the satellite broadcasters,
p93
aVthe power of the money changers \u2014
p94
aVthis vast money-go-round
p95
aVthat circulates now 32 times the amount of money necessary
p96
aVfor the trade it's supposed to be there to finance \u2014
p97
aVthe money changers, if you like,
p98
aVthe financial speculators
p99
aVthat have brought us all to our knees quite recently,
p100
aVthe power of the multinational corporations
p101
aVnow developing budgets
p102
aVoften bigger than medium-sized countries.
p103
aVThese live in a global space
p104
aVwhich is largely unregulated,
p105
aVnot subject to the rule of law,
p106
aVand in which people may act free of constraint.
p107
aa(lp108
VNow that suits the powerful
p109
aVup to a moment.
p110
aVIt's always suitable for those who have the most power
p111
aVto operate in spaces without constraint,
p112
aVbut the lesson of history is that, sooner or later,
p113
aVunregulated space \u2014
p114
aVspace not subject to the rule of law \u2014
p115
aVbecomes populated, not just by the things you wanted \u2014
p116
aVinternational trade, the Internet, etc. \u2014
p117
aVbut also by the things you don't want \u2014
p118
aVinternational criminality, international terrorism.
p119
aVThe revelation of 9/11
p120
aVis that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth,
p121
aVnevertheless,
p122
aVthose who inhabit that space can attack you
p123
aVeven in your most iconic of cities
p124
aVone bright September morning.
p125
aVIt's said that something like 60 percent
p126
aVof the four million dollars that was taken to fund 9/11
p127
aVactually passed through the institutions of the Twin Towers
p128
aVwhich 9/11 destroyed.
p129
aVYou see, our enemies also use this space \u2014
p130
aVthe space of mass travel, the Internet, satellite broadcasters \u2014
p131
aVto be able to get around their poison,
p132
aVwhich is about destroying our systems and our ways.
p133
aa(lp134
VSooner or later,
p135
aVsooner or later,
p136
aVthe rule of history
p137
aVis that where power goes
p138
aVgovernance must follow.
p139
aVAnd if it is therefore the case, as I believe it is,
p140
aVthat one of the phenomenon of our time
p141
aVis the globalization of power,
p142
aVthen it follows that one of the challenges of our time
p143
aVis to bring governance to the global space.
p144
aVAnd I believe that the decades ahead of us now
p145
aVwill be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent
p146
aVthe more or less we are able to achieve that aim:
p147
aVto bring governance to the global space.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow notice, I'm not talking about government.
p150
aVI'm not talking about setting up
p151
aVsome global democratic institution.
p152
aVMy own view, by the way, ladies and gentlemen,
p153
aVis that this is unlikely to be done
p154
aVby spawning more U.N. institutions.
p155
aVIf we didn't have the U.N., we'd have to invent it.
p156
aVThe world needs an international forum.
p157
aVIt needs a means by which you can legitimize international action.
p158
aVBut when it comes to governance of the global space,
p159
aVmy guess is this won't happen
p160
aVthrough the creation of more U.N. institutions.
p161
aVIt will actually happen by the powerful coming together
p162
aVand making treaty-based systems,
p163
aVtreaty-based agreements,
p164
aVto govern that global space.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd if you look, you can see them happening, already beginning to emerge.
p167
aVThe World Trade Organization: treaty-based organization,
p168
aVentirely treaty-based,
p169
aVand yet, powerful enough to hold even the most powerful, the United States,
p170
aVto account if necessary.
p171
aVKyoto: the beginnings of struggling to create
p172
aVa treaty-based organization.
p173
aVThe G20:
p174
aVwe know now that we have to put together an institution
p175
aVwhich is capable of bringing governance
p176
aVto that financial space for financial speculation.
p177
aVAnd that's what the G20 is, a treaty-based institution.
p178
aa(lp179
VNow there's a problem there,
p180
aVand we'll come back to it in a minute,
p181
aVwhich is that if you bring the most powerful together
p182
aVto make the rules in treaty-based institutions,
p183
aVto fill that governance space,
p184
aVthen what happens to the weak who are left out?
p185
aVAnd that's a big problem,
p186
aVand we'll return to it in just a second.
p187
aa(lp188
VSo there's my first message,
p189
aVthat if you are to pass through these turbulent times
p190
aVmore or less turbulently,
p191
aVthen our success in doing that
p192
aVwill in large measure depend on our capacity
p193
aVto bring sensible governance
p194
aVto the global space.
p195
aVAnd watch that beginning to happen.
p196
aVMy second point is,
p197
aVand I know I don't have to talk to an audience like this
p198
aVabout such a thing,
p199
aVbut power is not just shifting vertically,
p200
aVit's also shifting horizontally.
p201
aa(lp202
VYou might argue that the story, the history of civilizations,
p203
aVhas been civilizations gathered around seas \u2014
p204
aVwith the first ones around the Mediterranean,
p205
aVthe more recent ones in the ascendents of Western power around the Atlantic.
p206
aVWell it seems to me
p207
aVthat we're now seeing a fundamental shift of power, broadly speaking,
p208
aVaway from nations gathered around the Atlantic [seaboard]
p209
aVto the nations gathered around the Pacific rim.
p210
aVNow that begins with economic power,
p211
aVbut that's the way it always begins.
p212
aVYou already begin to see the development of foreign policies,
p213
aVthe augmentation of military budgets
p214
aVoccurring in the other growing powers in the world.
p215
aVI think actually
p216
aVthis is not so much a shift from the West to the East;
p217
aVsomething different is happening.
p218
aa(lp219
VMy guess is, for what it's worth,
p220
aVis that the United States will remain
p221
aVthe most powerful nation on earth
p222
aVfor the next 10 years, 15,
p223
aVbut the context in which she holds her power
p224
aVhas now radically altered; it has radically changed.
p225
aVWe are coming out of 50 years,
p226
aVmost unusual years, of history
p227
aVin which we have had a totally mono-polar world,
p228
aVin which every compass needle
p229
aVfor or against
p230
aVhas to be referenced by its position to Washington \u2014
p231
aVa world bestrode by a single colossus.
p232
aVBut that's not a usual case in history.
p233
aVIn fact, what's now emerging
p234
aVis the much more normal case of history.
p235
aVYou're beginning to see the emergence
p236
aVof a multi-polar world.
p237
aa(lp238
VUp until now,
p239
aVthe United States has been the dominant feature of our world.
p240
aVThey will remain the most powerful nation,
p241
aVbut they will be the most powerful nation
p242
aVin an increasingly multi-polar world.
p243
aVAnd you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up \u2014
p244
aVin China, of course,
p245
aVthough my own guess is that China's ascent to greatness is not smooth.
p246
aVIt's going to be quite grumpy
p247
aVas China begins to democratize her society
p248
aVafter liberalizing her economy.
p249
aVBut that's a subject of a different discussion.
p250
aVYou see India, you see Brazil.
p251
aVYou see increasingly
p252
aVthat the world now looks actually, for us Europeans,
p253
aVmuch more like Europe in the 19th century.
p254
aa(lp255
VEurope in the 19th century:
p256
aVa great British foreign secretary, Lord Canning,
p257
aVused to describe it as the "European concert of powers."
p258
aVThere was a balance, a five-sided balance.
p259
aVBritain always played to the balance.
p260
aVIf Paris got together with Berlin,
p261
aVBritain got together with Vienna and Rome to provide a counterbalance.
p262
aVNow notice,
p263
aVin a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world,
p264
aVyou have fixed alliances \u2014
p265
aVNATO, the Warsaw Pact.
p266
aVA fixed polarity of power
p267
aVmeans fixed alliances.
p268
aVBut a multiple polarity of power
p269
aVmeans shifting and changing alliances.
p270
aVAnd that's the world we're coming into,
p271
aVin which we will increasingly see
p272
aVthat our alliances are not fixed.
p273
aVCanning, the great British foreign secretary once said,
p274
aV"Britain has a common interest,
p275
aVbut no common allies."
p276
aVAnd we will see increasingly
p277
aVthat even we in the West
p278
aVwill reach out, have to reach out,
p279
aVbeyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powers
p280
aVto make alliances with others
p281
aVif we want to get things done in the world.
p282
aa(lp283
VNote, that when we went into Libya,
p284
aVit was not good enough for the West to do it alone;
p285
aVwe had to bring others in.
p286
aVWe had to bring, in this case, the Arab League in.
p287
aVMy guess is Iraq and Afghanistan are the last times
p288
aVwhen the West has tried to do it themselves,
p289
aVand we haven't succeeded.
p290
aVMy guess
p291
aVis that we're reaching the beginning of the end of 400 years \u2014
p292
aVI say 400 years because it's the end of the Ottoman Empire \u2014
p293
aVof the hegemony of Western power,
p294
aVWestern institutions and Western values.
p295
aVYou know, up until now, if the West got its act together,
p296
aVit could propose and dispose
p297
aVin every corner of the world.
p298
aVBut that's no longer true.
p299
aVTake the last financial crisis
p300
aVafter the Second World War.
p301
aVThe West got together \u2014
p302
aVthe Bretton Woods Institution, World Bank, International Monetary Fund \u2014
p303
aVthe problem solved.
p304
aVNow we have to call in others.
p305
aVNow we have to create the G20.
p306
aVNow we have to reach beyond the cozy circle
p307
aVof our Western friends.
p308
aa(lp309
VLet me make a prediction for you,
p310
aVwhich is probably even more startling.
p311
aVI suspect we are now reaching the end
p312
aVof 400 years
p313
aVwhen Western power was enough.
p314
aVPeople say to me, "The Chinese, of course,
p315
aVthey'll never get themselves involved
p316
aVin peace-making, multilateral peace-making around the world."
p317
aVOh yes? Why not?
p318
aVHow many Chinese troops
p319
aVare serving under the blue beret, serving under the blue flag,
p320
aVserving under the U.N. command in the world today?
p321
aV3,700.
p322
aVHow many Americans? 11.
p323
aVWhat is the largest naval contingent
p324
aVtackling the issue of Somali pirates?
p325
aVThe Chinese naval contingent.
p326
aVOf course they are, they are a mercantilist nation.
p327
aVThey want to keep the sea lanes open.
p328
aVIncreasingly, we are going to have to do business
p329
aVwith people with whom we do not share values,
p330
aVbut with whom, for the moment, we share common interests.
p331
aVIt's a whole new different way
p332
aVof looking at the world that is now emerging.
p333
aa(lp334
VAnd here's the third factor,
p335
aVwhich is totally different.
p336
aVToday in our modern world,
p337
aVbecause of the Internet,
p338
aVbecause of the kinds of things people have been talking about here,
p339
aVeverything is connected to everything.
p340
aVWe are now interdependent.
p341
aVWe are now interlocked,
p342
aVas nations, as individuals,
p343
aVin a way which has never been the case before,
p344
aVnever been the case before.
p345
aVThe interrelationship of nations,
p346
aVwell it's always existed.
p347
aVDiplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations.
p348
aVBut now we are intimately locked together.
p349
aVYou get swine flu in Mexico,
p350
aVit's a problem for Charles de Gaulle Airport
p351
aV24 hours later.
p352
aVLehman Brothers goes down, the whole lot collapses.
p353
aVThere are fires in the steppes of Russia,
p354
aVfood riots in Africa.
p355
aa(lp356
VWe are all now deeply, deeply, deeply interconnected.
p357
aVAnd what that means
p358
aVis the idea of a nation state acting alone,
p359
aVnot connected with others,
p360
aVnot working with others,
p361
aVis no longer a viable proposition.
p362
aVBecause the actions of a nation state
p363
aVare neither confined to itself,
p364
aVnor is it sufficient for the nation state itself
p365
aVto control its own territory,
p366
aVbecause the effects outside the nation state
p367
aVare now beginning to affect what happens inside them.
p368
aa(lp369
VI was a young soldier
p370
aVin the last of the small empire wars of Britain.
p371
aVAt that time, the defense of my country
p372
aVwas about one thing and one thing only:
p373
aVhow strong was our army, how strong was our air force,
p374
aVhow strong was our navy and how strong were our allies.
p375
aVThat was when the enemy was outside the walls.
p376
aVNow the enemy is inside the walls.
p377
aVNow if I want to talk about the defense of my country,
p378
aVI have to speak to the Minister of Health
p379
aVbecause pandemic disease is a threat to my security,
p380
aVI have to speak to the Minister of Agriculture
p381
aVbecause food security is a threat to my security,
p382
aVI have to speak to the Minister of Industry
p383
aVbecause the fragility of our hi-tech infrastructure
p384
aVis now a point of attack for our enemies \u2014
p385
aVas we see from cyber warfare \u2014
p386
aVI have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairs
p387
aVbecause who has entered my country,
p388
aVwho lives in that terraced house in that inner city
p389
aVhas a direct effect on what happens in my country \u2014
p390
aVas we in London saw in the 7/7 bombings.
p391
aVIt's no longer the case that the security of a country
p392
aVis simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense.
p393
aVIt's its capacity to lock together its institutions.
p394
aa(lp395
VAnd this tells you something very important.
p396
aVIt tells you that, in fact,
p397
aVour governments, vertically constructed,
p398
aVconstructed on the economic model of the Industrial Revolution \u2014
p399
aVvertical hierarchy, specialization of tasks,
p400
aVcommand structures \u2014
p401
aVhave got the wrong structures completely.
p402
aVYou in business know
p403
aVthat the paradigm structure of our time, ladies and gentlemen,
p404
aVis the network.
p405
aVIt's your capacity to network that matters,
p406
aVboth within your governments and externally.
p407
aa(lp408
VSo here is Ashdown's third law.
p409
aVBy the way, don't ask me about Ashdown's first law and second law
p410
aVbecause I haven't invented those yet;
p411
aVit always sounds better if there's a third law, doesn't it?
p412
aVAshdown's third law is that in the modern age,
p413
aVwhere everything is connected to everything,
p414
aVthe most important thing about what you can do
p415
aVis what you can do with others.
p416
aVThe most important bit about your structure \u2014
p417
aVwhether you're a government, whether you're an army regiment,
p418
aVwhether you're a business \u2014
p419
aVis your docking points, your interconnectors,
p420
aVyour capacity to network with others.
p421
aVYou understand that in industry;
p422
aVgovernments don't.
p423
aa(lp424
VBut now one final thing.
p425
aVIf it is the case, ladies and gentlemen \u2014 and it is \u2014
p426
aVthat we are now locked together
p427
aVin a way that has never been quite the same before,
p428
aVthen it's also the case that we share a destiny with each other.
p429
aVSuddenly and for the very first time,
p430
aVcollective defense, the thing that has dominated us
p431
aVas the concept of securing our nations,
p432
aVis no longer enough.
p433
aVIt used to be the case
p434
aVthat if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe, I was safe;
p435
aVif my country was more powerful than their country, I was safe;
p436
aVmy alliance, like NATO, was more powerful than their alliance, I was safe.
p437
aVIt is no longer the case.
p438
aVThe advent of the interconnectedness
p439
aVand of the weapons of mass destruction
p440
aVmeans that, increasingly,
p441
aVI share a destiny with my enemy.
p442
aa(lp443
VWhen I was a diplomat
p444
aVnegotiating the disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union
p445
aVin Geneva in the 1970s,
p446
aVwe succeeded because we understood
p447
aVwe shared a destiny with them.
p448
aVCollective security is not enough.
p449
aVPeace has come to Northern Ireland
p450
aVbecause both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn't work.
p451
aVThey shared a destiny with their enemies.
p452
aVOne of the great barriers to peace in the Middle East
p453
aVis that both sides, both Israel and, I think, the Palestinians,
p454
