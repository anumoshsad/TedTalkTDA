VWhat's the scariest thing you've ever done?
p4
aVOr another way to say it is,
p5
aVwhat's the most dangerous  thing that you've ever done?
p6
aVAnd why did you do it?
p7
aVI know what the most dangerous thing is
p8
aVthat I've ever done
p9
aVbecause NASA does the math.
p10
aVYou look back to the first five shuttle launches,
p11
aVthe odds of a catastrophic event
p12
aVduring the first five shuttle launches
p13
aVwas one in nine.
p14
aVAnd even when I first flew in the shuttle
p15
aVback in 1995, 74 shuttle flight,
p16
aVthe odds were still now that we look back
p17
aVabout one in 38 or so \u2014 one in 35, one in 40.
p18
aVNot great odds, so it's a really interesting day
p19
aVwhen you wake up at the Kennedy Space Center
p20
aVand you're going to go to space that day
p21
aVbecause you realize by the end of the day
p22
aVyou're either going to be floating  effortlessly, gloriously in space,
p23
aVor you'll be dead.
p24
aVYou go into, at the Kennedy Space Center,
p25
aVthe suit-up room,
p26
aVthe same room that our childhood heroes
p27
aVgot dressed in,
p28
aVthat Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin got suited in
p29
aVto go ride the Apollo rocket to the moon.
p30
aVAnd I got my pressure suit built around me
p31
aVand rode down outside in the van
p32
aVheading out to the launchpad \u2014
p33
aVin the Astro van \u2014 heading out to the launchpad,
p34
aVand as you come around the corner
p35
aVat the Kennedy Space Center,
p36
aVit's normally predawn, and in the distance,
p37
aVlit up by the huge xenon lights,
p38
aVis your spaceship \u2014
p39
aVthe vehicle that is going to take you off the planet.
p40
aVThe crew is sitting in the Astro van
p41
aVsort of hushed, almost holding hands,
p42
aVlooking at that as it gets bigger and bigger.
p43
aVWe ride the elevator up
p44
aVand we crawl in, on your hands and knees
p45
aVinto the spaceship, one at a time,
p46
aVand you worm your way up
p47
aVinto your chair and plunk yourself down
p48
aVon your back.
p49
aVAnd the hatch is closed,
p50
aVand suddenly,
p51
aVwhat has been a lifetime of both dreams and denial
p52
aVis becoming real,
p53
aVsomething that I dreamed about,
p54
aVin fact, that I chose to do when I was nine years old,
p55
aVis now suddenly within not too many minutes
p56
aVof actually happening.
p57
aVIn the astronaut business \u2014
p58
aVthe shuttle is a very complicated vehicle;
p59
aVit's the most complicated flying machine ever built.
p60
aVAnd in the astronaut business,  we have a saying, which is,
p61
aVthere is no problem so bad
p62
aVthat you can't make it worse.
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aVAnd so you're very conscious in the cockpit;
p65
aVyou're thinking about all of the things
p66
aVthat you might have to do,
p67
aVall the switches and all the  wickets you have to go through.
p68
aVAnd as the time gets closer and closer,
p69
aVthis excitement is building.
p70
aVAnd then about three and a  half minutes before launch,
p71
aVthe huge nozzles on the back,
p72
aVlike the size of big church bells,
p73
aVswing back and forth
p74
aVand the mass of them is such
p75
aVthat it sways the whole vehicle,
p76
aVlike the vehicle is alive underneath you,
p77
aVlike an elephant getting up  off its knees or something.
p78
aVAnd then about 30 seconds before launch,
p79
aVthe vehicle is completely alive \u2014
p80
aVit is ready to go \u2014
p81
aVthe APUs are running,
p82
aVthe computers are all self-contained,
p83
aVit's ready to leave the planet.
p84
aVAnd 15 seconds before launch, this happens:
p85
aV(Video) Voice: 12, 11, 10,
p86
aVnine, eight, seven, six \u2014
p87
aV(Space shuttle preparing for takeoff)
p88
aV\u2014 start, two, one,
p89
aVbooster ignition, and liftoff of  the space shuttle Discovery,
p90
aVreturning to the space station, paving the way ...
p91
aV(Space shuttle taking off)
p92
aa(lp93
VChris Hadfield: It is incredibly powerful
p94
aVto be on board one of these things.
p95
aVYou are in the grip of something
p96
aVthat is vastly more powerful than yourself.
p97
aVIt's shaking you so hard you can't focus
p98
aVon the instruments in front of you.
p99
aVIt's like you're in the jaws of some enormous dog
p100
aVand there's a foot in the small of your back
p101
aVpushing you into space,
p102
aVaccelerating wildly straight up,
p103
aVshouldering your way through the air,
p104
aVand you're in a very complex place \u2014
p105
aVpaying attention, watching the vehicle
p106
aVgo through each one of its wickets
p107
aVwith a steadily increasing smile on your face.
p108
aVAfter two minutes, those solid rockets explode off
p109
aVand then you just have the liquid engines,
p110
aVthe hydrogen and oxygen,
p111
aVand it's as if you're in a dragster
p112
aVwith your foot to the floor
p113
aVand accelerating like you've never accelerated.
p114
aVYou get lighter and lighter,
p115
aVthe force gets on us heavier and heavier.
p116
aVIt feels like
p117
aVsomeone's pouring cement on you or something.
p118
aVUntil finally,
p119
aVafter about eight minutes and 40 seconds or so,
p120
aVwe are finally at exactly the right altitude,
p121
aVexactly the right speed,
p122
aVthe right direction, the engine shut off,
p123
aVand we're weightless.
p124
aVAnd we're alive.
p125
aa(lp126
VIt's an amazing experience.
p127
aVBut why would we take that risk?
p128
aVWhy would you do something that dangerous?
p129
aa(lp130
VIn my case the answer is fairly straightforward.
p131
aVI was inspired as a youngster
p132
aVthat this was what I wanted to do.
p133
aVI watched the first people walk on the moon
p134
aVand to me, it was just an obvious thing \u2014
p135
aVI want to somehow turn myself into that.
p136
aVBut the real question is,
p137
aVhow do you deal with the danger of it
p138
aVand the fear that comes from it?
p139
aVHow do you deal with fear versus danger?
p140
aVAnd having the goal in mind, thinking about where it might lead,
p141
aVdirected me to a life of
p142
aVlooking at all of the small details to allow
p143
aVthis to become possible,
p144
aVto be able to launch and go  help build a space station
p145
aVwhere you are on board a million-pound creation
p146
aVthat's going around the world at five miles a second,
p147
aVeight kilometers a second,
p148
aVaround the world 16 times a day,
p149
aVwith experiments on board that are teaching us
p150
aVwhat the substance of the universe is made of
p151
aVand running 200 experiments inside.
p152
aVBut maybe even more importantly,
p153
aVallowing us to see the world in a way
p154
aVthat is impossible through any other means,
p155
aVto be able to look down
p156
aVand have \u2014 if your jaw could drop, it would \u2014
p157
aVthe jaw-dropping gorgeousness of the turning orb
p158
aVlike a self-propelled art gallery of fantastic,
p159
aVconstantly changing beauty that is the world itself.
p160
aVAnd you see, because of the speed,
p161
aVa sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes
p162
aVfor half a year.
p163
aVAnd the most magnificent part of all that
p164
aVis to go outside on a spacewalk.
p165
aVYou are in a one-person spaceship
p166
aVthat is your spacesuit,
p167
aVand you're going through space with the world.
p168
aVIt's an entirely different perspective,
p169
aVyou're not looking up at the universe,
p170
aVyou and the Earth are going  through the universe together.
p171
aVAnd you're holding on with one hand,
p172
aVlooking at the world turn beside you.
p173
aVIt's roaring silently
p174
aVwith color and texture as it pours by
p175
aVmesmerizingly next to you.
p176
aVAnd if you can tear your eyes away from that
p177
aVand you look under your arm
p178
aVdown at the rest of everything,
p179
aVit's unfathomable blackness,
p180
aVwith a texture you feel like you  could stick your hand into.
p181
aVand you are holding on with one hand,
p182
aVone link to the other seven billion people.
p183
aVAnd I was outside on my first spacewalk
p184
aa(lp185
Vwhen my left eye went blind,
p186
aVand I didn't know why.
p187
aVSuddenly my left eye slammed shut
p188
aVin great pain
p189
aVand I couldn't figure out why my eye wasn't working.
p190
aVI was thinking, what do I do next?
p191
aVI thought, well maybe that's why we have two eyes,
p192
aVso I kept working.
p193
aVBut unfortunately, without gravity,
p194
aVtears don't fall.
p195
aVSo you just get a bigger and  bigger ball of whatever that is
p196
aVmixed with your tears on your eye
p197
aVuntil eventually, the ball becomes so big
p198
aVthat the surface tension takes it  across the bridge of your nose
p199
aVlike a tiny little waterfall
p200
aVand goes "goosh" into your other eye,
p201
aVand now I was completely blind
p202
aVoutside the spaceship.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo what's the scariest thing you've ever done?
p205
aV(Laughter)
p206
aVMaybe it's spiders.
p207
aVA lot of people are afraid of spiders.
p208
aVI think you should be afraid of spiders \u2014
p209
aVspiders are creepy and they've got long, hairy legs,
p210
aVand spiders like this one, the brown recluse \u2014
p211
aVit's horrible. If a brown recluse bites you,
p212
aVyou end with one of these  horrible, big necrotic things
p213
aVon your leg
p214
aVand there might be one right now
p215
aVsitting on the chair behind you, in fact.
p216
aVAnd how do you know?
p217
aVAnd so a spider lands on you,
p218
aVand you go through this great, spasmy attack
p219
aVbecause spiders are scary.
p220
aVBut then you could say, well  is there a brown recluse
p221
aVsitting on the chair beside me or not?
p222
aVI don't know. Are there brown recluses here?
p223
aVSo if you actually do the research, you find out that
p224
aVin the world there are about  50,000 different types of spiders,
p225
aVand there are about two dozen that are venomous
p226
aVout of 50,000.
p227
aVAnd if you're in Canada, because of the cold winters
p228
aVhere in B.C., there's about 720,  730 different types of spiders
p229
aVand there's one \u2014 one \u2014
p230
aVthat is venomous,
p231
aVand its venom isn't even fatal,
p232
aVit's just kind of like a nasty sting.
p233
aVAnd that spider \u2014 not only that,
p234
aVbut that spider has beautiful markings on it,
p235
aVit's like "I'm dangerous. I got a big radiation  symbol on my back, it's the black widow."
p236
aVSo, if you're even slightly careful
p237
aVyou can avoid running into the one spider \u2014
p238
aVand it lives close the ground,
p239
aVyou're walking along, you are  never going to go through
p240
aVa spider web where a black widow bites you.
p241
aVSpider webs like this, it doesn't build those,
p242
aVit builds them down in the corners.
p243
aVAnd its a black widow because
p244
aVthe female spider eats the male;
p245
aVit doesn't care about you.
p246
aVSo in fact,
p247
aVthe next time you walk into a spiderweb,
p248
aVyou don't need to panic and go  with your caveman reaction.
p249
aVThe danger is entirely different than the fear.
p250
aa(lp251
VHow do you get around it, though?
p252
aVHow do you change your behavior?
p253
aVWell, next time you see a spiderweb,
p254
aVhave a good look, make sure  it's not a black widow spider,
p255
aVand then walk into it.
p256
aVAnd then you see another spiderweb
p257
aVand walk into that one.
p258
aVIt's just a little bit of fluffy stuff. It's not a big deal.
p259
aVAnd the spider that may come out is  no more threat to you than a lady bug
p260
aVor a butterfly.
p261
aVAnd then I guarantee you if you  walk through 100 spiderwebs
p262
aVyou will have changed
p263
aVyour fundamental human behavior,
p264
aVyour caveman reaction,
p265
aVand you will now be able to walk  in the park in the morning
p266
aVand not worry about that spiderweb \u2014
p267
aVor into your grandma's attic or whatever,
p268
aVinto your own basement.
p269
aVAnd you can apply this to anything.
p270
aa(lp271
VIf you're outside on a spacewalk and you're blinded,
p272
aVyour natural reaction would be to panic, I think.
p273
aVIt would make you nervous and worried.
p274
aVBut we had considered all the venom,
p275
aVand we had practiced with a whole  variety of different spiderwebs.
p276
aVWe knew everything there is to know
p277
aVabout the spacesuit
p278
aVand we trained underwater thousands of times.
p279
aVAnd we don't just practice things going right,
p280
aVwe practice things going wrong all the time,
p281
aVso that you are constantly walking  through those spiderwebs.
p282
aVAnd not just underwater, but  also in virtual reality labs
p283
aVwith the helmet and the gloves
p284
aVso you feel like it's realistic.
p285
aVSo when you finally actually  get outside on a spacewalk,
p286
aVit feels much different than it would
p287
aVif you just went out first time.
p288
aVAnd even if you're blinded,
p289
aVyour natural, panicky reaction doesn't happen.
p290
aVInstead you kind of look around and go,
p291
aV"Okay, I can't see,
p292
aVbut I can hear, I can talk,
p293
aVScott Parazynski is out here with me.
p294
aVHe could come over and help me."
p295
aVWe actually practiced incapacitated crew rescue,
p296
aVso he could float me like a blimp
p297
aVand stuff me into the airlock if he had to.
p298
aVI could find my own way back.
p299
aVIt's not nearly as big a deal.
p300
aVAnd actually, if you keep on crying for a while,
p301
aVwhatever that gunk was that's  in your eye starts to dilute
p302
aVand you can start to see again,
p303
aVand Houston, if you negotiate with them,
p304
aVthey will let you then keep working.
p305
aVWe finished everything on the spacewalk
p306
aVand when we came back inside,
p307
aVJeff got some cotton batting and took  the crusty stuff around my eyes,
p308
aVand it turned out it was just the anti-fog,
p309
aVsort of a mixture of oil and soap, that got in my eye.
p310
aVAnd now we use Johnson's No More Tears,
p311
aVwhich we probably should've been using
p312
aVright from the very beginning. (Laughter)
p313
aa(lp314
VBut the key to that is
p315
aVby looking at the difference
p316
aVbetween perceived danger and actual danger,
p317
aVwhere is the real risk?
p318
aVWhat is the real thing that you should be afraid of?
p319
aVNot just a generic fear of bad things happening.
p320
aVYou can fundamentally change  your reaction to things
p321
aVso that it allows you to go places
p322
aVand see things and do things
p323
aVthat otherwise would be completely denied to you ...
p324
aa(lp325
Vwhere you could see the  hardpan south of the Sahara,
p326
aVor you can see New York City
p327
aVin a way that is almost dreamlike,
p328
aVor the unconscious gingham  of Eastern Europe fields
p329
aVor the Great Lakes
p330
aVas a collection of small puddles.
p331
aVYou can see the fault lines of San Francisco
p332
aVand the way the water pours out under the bridge,
p333
aVjust entirely different
p334
aVthan any other way that you could have
p335
aVif you had not found a way to conquer your fear.
p336
aVYou see a beauty that otherwise
p337
aVnever would have happened.
p338
aa(lp339
VIt's time to come home at the end.
p340
aVThis is our spaceship,
p341
aVthe Soyuz, that little one.
p342
aVThree of us climb in,
p343
aVand then this spaceship detaches from the station
p344
aVand falls into the atmosphere.
p345
aVThese two parts here
p346
aVactually melt, we jettison them and they burn up
p347
aVin the atmosphere.
p348
aVThe only part that survives is the little bullet
p349
aVthat we're riding in,
p350
aVand it falls into the atmosphere,
p351
aVand in essence
p352
aVyou are riding a meteorite home,
p353
aVand riding meteorites is scary,
p354
aVand it ought to be.
p355
aVBut instead of riding into the atmosphere
p356
aVjust screaming, like you would
p357
aVif suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite
p358
aVback to Earth \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p359
aVinstead, 20 years previously
p360
aVwe had started studying Russian,
p361
aVand then once you learn Russian, then we
p362
aVlearned orbital mechanics in Russian,
p363
aVand then we learned vehicle control theory,
p364
aVand then we got into the simulator
p365
aVand practiced over and over and over again.
p366
aVAnd in fact, you can fly this meteorite
p367
aVand steer it and land in about a 15-kilometer circle
p368
aVanywhere on the Earth.
p369
aVSo in fact, when our crew was coming back
p370
aVinto the atmosphere inside the Soyuz,
p371
aVwe weren't screaming, we were laughing;
p372
aVit was fun.
p373
aVAnd when the great big parachute opened,
p374
aVwe knew that if it didn't open
p375
aVthere's a second parachute,
p376
aVand it runs on a nice little clockwork mechanism.
p377
aVSo we came back, we came thundering back
p378
aVto Earth and this is what it looked like
p379
aVto land in a Soyuz, in Kazakhstan.
p380
aV(Video) Reporter: And you can see one of those
p381
aVsearch and recovery helicopters, once again
p382
aVthat helicopter part of dozen such Russian
p383
aVMi-8 helicopters.
p384
aVTouchdown \u2014 3:14 and 48 seconds,
p385
aVa.m. Central Time.
p386
aVCH: And you roll to a stop
p387
aVas if someone threw your  spaceship at the ground
p388
aVand it tumbles end over end,
p389
aVbut you're ready for it
p390
aVyou're in a custom-built seat,
p391
aVyou know how the shock absorber works.
p392
aVAnd then eventually the Russians reach in,
p393
aVdrag you out,
p394
aVplunk you into a chair,
p395
aVand you can now look back at
p396
aVwhat was an incredible experience.
p397
aVYou have taken the dreams of that
p398
aVnine-year-old boy,
p399
aVwhich were impossible
p400
aVand dauntingly scary,
p401
aVdauntingly terrifying,
p402
aVand put them into practice,
p403
aVand figured out a way to reprogram yourself,
p404
aVto change your primal fear
p405
aVso that it allowed you to come back
p406
aVwith a set of experiences and a level of inspiration
p407
aVfor other people
p408
aVthat never could have been possible otherwise.
p409
aVJust to finish, they asked me to play that guitar.
p410
aVI know this song,
p411
aVand it's really a tribute to the genius
p412
aVof David Bowie himself,
p413
aVbut it's also, I think,
p414
aVa reflection of the fact that we are not machines
p415
aVexploring the universe,
p416
aVwe are people,
p417
aVand we're taking
p418
aVthat ability to adapt
p419
aVand that ability to understand
p420
aVand the ability to take
p421
aVour own self-perception into a new place.
