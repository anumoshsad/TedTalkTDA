VImagine you're in Rome,
p4
aVand you've made your way to the Vatican Museums.
p5
aVAnd you've been shuffling down long corridors,
p6
aVpast statues, frescoes, lots and lots of stuff.
p7
aVYou're heading towards the Sistine Chapel.
p8
aVAt last \u2014 a long corridor, a stair and a door.
p9
aVYou're at the threshold of the Sistine Chapel.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo what are you expecting?
p12
aVSoaring domes? Choirs of angels?
p13
aVWe don't really have any of that there.
p14
aVInstead, you may ask yourself, what do we have?
p15
aa(lp16
VWell, curtains up on the Sistine Chapel.
p17
aVAnd I mean literally, you're surrounded by painted curtains,
p18
aVthe original decoration of this chapel.
p19
aVChurches used tapestries not just to keep out cold during long masses,
p20
aVbut as a way to represent the great theater of life.
p21
aVThe human drama in which each one of us plays a part is a great story,
p22
aVa story that encompasses the whole world
p23
aVand that came to unfold in the three stages
p24
aVof the painting in the Sistine Chapel.
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, this building started out as a space for a small group
p27
aVof wealthy, educated Christian priests.
p28
aVThey prayed there. They elected their pope there.
p29
aVFive hundred years ago,
p30
aVit was the ultimate ecclesiastical man cave.
p31
aVSo, you may ask, how can it be that today it attracts and delights
p32
aVfive million people a year,
p33
aVfrom all different backgrounds?
p34
aVBecause in that compressed space, there was a creative explosion,
p35
aVignited by the electric excitement of new geopolitical frontiers,
p36
aVwhich set on fire the ancient missionary tradition of the Church
p37
aVand produced one of the greatest works of art in history.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow, this development took place as a great evolution,
p40
aVmoving from the beginning of a few elite,
p41
aVand eventually able to speak to audiences of people
p42
aVthat come from all over the world.
p43
aVThis evolution took place in three stages,
p44
aVeach one linked to a historical circumstance.
p45
aVThe first one was rather limited in scope.
p46
aVIt reflected the rather parochial perspective.
p47
aVThe second one took place after worldviews were dramatically altered
p48
aVafter Columbus's historical voyage;
p49
aVand the third,
p50
aVwhen the Age of Discovery was well under way
p51
aVand the Church rose to the challenge
p52
aVof going global.
p53
aa(lp54
VThe original decoration of this church reflected a smaller world.
p55
aVThere were busy scenes
p56
aVthat told the stories of the lives of Jesus and Moses,
p57
aVreflecting the development of the Jewish and Christian people.
p58
aVThe man who commissioned this, Pope Sixtus IV,
p59
aVassembled a dream team of Florentine art,
p60
aVincluding men like Sandro Botticelli
p61
aVand the man who would become Michelangelo's future painting teacher,
p62
aVGhirlandaio.
p63
aVThese men, they blanketed the walls with a frieze of pure color,
p64
aVand in these stories you'll notice familiar landscapes,
p65
aVthe artists using Roman monuments or a Tuscan landscape
p66
aVto render a faraway story, something much more familiar.
p67
aVWith the addition of images of the Pope's friends and family,
p68
aVthis was a perfect decoration for a small court
p69
aVlimited to the European continent.
p70
aVBut in 1492, the New World was discovered,
p71
aVhorizons were expanding,
p72
aVand this little 133 by 46-foot microcosm had to expand as well.
p73
aVAnd it did,
p74
aVthanks to a creative genius,
p75
aVa visionary and an awesome story.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow, the creative genius was Michelangelo Buonarroti,
p78
aV33 years old when he was tapped to decorate 12,000 square feet of ceiling,
p79
aVand the deck was stacked against him \u2014
p80
aVhe had trained in painting but had left to pursue sculpture.
p81
aVThere were angry patrons in Florence because he had left a stack
p82
aVof incomplete commissions,
p83
aVlured to Rome by the prospect of a great sculptural project,
p84
aVand that project had fallen through.
p85
aVAnd he had been left with a commission to paint 12 apostles
p86
aVagainst a decorative background in the Sistine Chapel ceiling,
p87
aVwhich would look like every other ceiling in Italy.
p88
aa(lp89
VBut genius rose to the challenge.
p90
aVIn an age when a man dared to sail across the Atlantic Ocean,
p91
aVMichelangelo dared to chart new artistic waters.
p92
aVHe, too, would tell a story \u2014
p93
aVno Apostles \u2014 but a story of great beginnings,
p94
aVthe story of Genesis.
p95
aa(lp96
VNot really an easy sell, stories on a ceiling.
p97
aVHow would you be able to read a busy scene from 62 feet below?
p98
aVThe painting technique that had been handed on for 200 years
p99
aVin Florentine studios was not equipped for this kind of a narrative.
p100
aa(lp101
VBut Michelangelo wasn't really a painter,
p102
aVand so he played to his strengths.
p103
aVInstead of being accustomed to filling space with busyness,
p104
aVhe took a hammer and chisel and hacked away at a piece of marble
p105
aVto reveal the figure within.
p106
aVMichelangelo was an essentialist;
p107
aVhe would tell his story in massive, dynamic bodies.
p108
aa(lp109
VThis plan was embraced by the larger-than-life Pope Julius II,
p110
aVa man who was unafraid of Michelangelo's brazen genius.
p111
aVHe was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV,
p112
aVand he had been steeped in art for 30 years and he knew its power.
p113
aVAnd history has handed down the moniker of the Warrior Pope,
p114
aVbut this man's legacy to the Vatican \u2014 it wasn't fortresses and artillery,
p115
aVit was art.
p116
aVHe left us the Raphael Rooms, the Sistine Chapel.
p117
aVHe left St. Peter's Basilica
p118
aVas well as an extraordinary collection of Greco-Roman sculptures \u2014
p119
aVdecidedly un-Christian works that would become the seedbed
p120
aVof the world's first modern museum, the Vatican Museums.
p121
aVJulius was a man
p122
aVwho envisioned a Vatican that would be eternally relevant
p123
aVthrough grandeur and through beauty,
p124
aVand he was right.
p125
aVThe encounter between these two giants, Michelangelo and Julius II,
p126
aVthat's what gave us the Sistine Chapel.
p127
aVMichelangelo was so committed to this project,
p128
aVthat he succeeded in getting the job done in three and a half years,
p129
aVusing a skeleton crew and spending most of the time, hours on end,
p130
aVreaching up above his head to paint the stories on the ceiling.
p131
aa(lp132
VSo let's look at this ceiling
p133
aVand see storytelling gone global.
p134
aVNo more familiar artistic references to the world around you.
p135
aVThere's just space and structure and energy;
p136
aVa monumental painted framework which opens onto nine panels,
p137
aVmore driven by sculptural form than painterly color.
p138
aVAnd we stand in the far end by the entrance,
p139
aVfar from the altar and from the gated enclosure intended for the clergy
p140
aVand we peer into the distance, looking for a beginning.
p141
aVAnd whether in scientific inquiry or in biblical tradition,
p142
aVwe think in terms of a primal spark.
p143
aVMichelangelo gave us an initial energy
p144
aVwhen he gave us the separation of light and dark,
p145
aVa churning figure blurry in the distance,
p146
aVcompressed into a tight space.
p147
aVThe next figure looms larger,
p148
aVand you see a figure hurtling from one side to the next.
p149
aVHe leaves in his wake the sun, the moon, vegetation.
p150
aVMichelangelo didn't focus on the stuff that was being created,
p151
aVunlike all the other artists.
p152
aVHe focused on the act of creation.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd then the movement stops, like a caesura in poetry
p155
aVand the creator hovers.
p156
aVSo what's he doing?
p157
aVIs he creating land? Is he creating sea?
p158
aVOr is he looking back over his handiwork, the universe and his treasures,
p159
aVjust like Michelangelo must have,
p160
aVlooking back over his work in the ceiling
p161
aVand proclaiming, "It is good."
p162
aa(lp163
VSo now the scene is set,
p164
aVand you get to the culmination of creation, which is man.
p165
aVAdam leaps to the eye, a light figure against a dark background.
p166
aVBut looking closer,
p167
aVthat leg is pretty languid on the ground,
p168
aVthe arm is heavy on the knee.
p169
aVAdam lacks that interior spark
p170
aVthat will impel him to greatness.
p171
aVThat spark is about to be conferred by the creator in that finger,
p172
aVwhich is one millimeter from the hand of Adam.
p173
aVIt puts us at the edge of our seats,
p174
aVbecause we're one moment from that contact,
p175
aVthrough which that man will discover his purpose,
p176
aVleap up and take his place at the pinnacle of creation.
p177
aa(lp178
VAnd then Michelangelo threw a curveball.
p179
aVWho is in that other arm?
p180
aVEve, first woman.
p181
aVNo, she's not an afterthought. She's part of the plan.
p182
aVShe's always been in his mind.
p183
aVLook at her, so intimate with God that her hand curls around his arm.
p184
aVAnd for me, an American art historian from the 21st century,
p185
aVthis was the moment that the painting spoke to me.
p186
aVBecause I realized that this representation of the human drama
p187
aVwas always about men and women \u2014
p188
aVso much so, that the dead center, the heart of the ceiling,
p189
aVis the creation of woman, not Adam.
p190
aVAnd the fact is, that when you see them together in the Garden of Eden,
p191
aVthey fall together
p192
aVand together their proud posture turns into folded shame.
p193
aa(lp194
VYou are at critical juncture now in the ceiling.
p195
aVYou are exactly at the point where you and I can go
p196
aVno further into the church.
p197
aVThe gated enclosure keeps us out of the inner sanctum,
p198
aVand we are cast out much like Adam and Eve.
p199
aVThe remaining scenes in the ceiling,
p200
aVthey mirror the crowded chaos of the world around us.
p201
aVYou have Noah and his Ark and the flood.
p202
aVYou have Noah. He's making a sacrifice and a covenant with God.
p203
aVMaybe he's the savior.
p204
aVOh, but no, Noah is the one who grew grapes, invented wine,
p205
aVgot drunk and passed out naked in his barn.
p206
aVIt is a curious way to design the ceiling,
p207
aVnow starting out with God creating life,
p208
aVending up with some guy blind drunk in a barn.
p209
aVAnd so, compared with Adam,
p210
aVyou might think Michelangelo is making fun of us.
p211
aa(lp212
VBut he's about to dispel the gloom
p213
aVby using those bright colors right underneath Noah:
p214
aVemerald, topaz, scarlet on the prophet Zechariah.
p215
aVZechariah foresees a light coming from the east,
p216
aVand we are turned at this juncture to a new destination,
p217
aVwith sibyls and prophets who will lead us on a parade.
p218
aVYou have the heroes and heroines who make safe the way,
p219
aVand we follow the mothers and fathers.
p220
aVThey are the motors of this great human engine, driving it forward.
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd now we're at the keystone of the ceiling,
p223
aVthe culmination of the whole thing,
p224
aVwith a figure that looks like he's about to fall out of his space
p225
aVinto our space,
p226
aVencroaching our space.
p227
aa(lp228
VThis is the most important juncture.
p229
aVPast meets present.
p230
aVThis figure, Jonah, who spent three days in the belly of the whale,
p231
aVfor the Christians, is the symbol of the renewal of humanity
p232
aVthrough Jesus' sacrifice,
p233
aVbut for the multitudes of visitors to that museum
p234
aVfrom all faiths who visit there every day,
p235
aVhe is the moment the distant past encounters and meets immediate reality.
p236
aa(lp237
VAll of this brings us to the yawning archway of the altar wall,
p238
aVwhere we see Michelangelo's Last Judgment,
p239
aVpainted in 1534 after the world had changed again.
p240
aVThe Reformation had splintered the Church,
p241
aVthe Ottoman Empire had made Islam a household word
p242
aVand Magellan had found a route into the Pacific Ocean.
p243
aVHow is a 59-year-old artist who has never been any further than Venice
p244
aVgoing to speak to this new world?
p245
aVMichelangelo chose to paint destiny,
p246
aVthat universal desire,
p247
aVcommon to all of us,
p248
aVto leave a legacy of excellence.
p249
aVTold in terms of the Christian vision of the Last Judgment,
p250
aVthe end of the world,
p251
aVMichelangelo gave you a series of figures
p252
aVwho are wearing these strikingly beautiful bodies.
p253
aVThey have no more covers, no more portraits
p254
aVexcept for a couple.
p255
aVIt's a composition only out of bodies,
p256
aV391, no two alike,
p257
aVunique like each and every one of us.
p258
aVThey start in the lower corner, breaking away from the ground,
p259
aVstruggling and trying to rise.
p260
aVThose who have risen reach back to help others,
p261
aVand in one amazing vignette,
p262
aVyou have a black man and a white man pulled up together
p263
aVin an incredible vision of human unity
p264
aVin this new world.
p265
aVThe lion's share of the space goes to the winner's circle.
p266
aVThere you find men and women completely nude like athletes.
p267
aVThey are the ones who have overcome adversity,
p268
aVand Michelangelo's vision of people who combat adversity,
p269
aVovercome obstacles \u2014
p270
aVthey're just like athletes.
p271
aVSo you have men and women flexing and posing
p272
aVin this extraordinary spotlight.
p273
aVPresiding over this assembly is Jesus,
p274
aVfirst a suffering man on the cross,
p275
aVnow a glorious ruler in Heaven.
p276
aVAnd as Michelangelo proved in his painting,
p277
aVhardship, setbacks and obstacles,
p278
aVthey don't limit excellence, they forge it.
p279
aa(lp280
VNow, this does lead us to one odd thing.
p281
aVThis is the Pope's private chapel,
p282
aVand the best way you can describe that is indeed a stew of nudes.
p283
aVBut Michelangelo was trying to use only the best artistic language,
p284
aVthe most universal artistic language he could think of:
p285
aVthat of the human body.
p286
aVAnd so instead of the way of showing virtue such as fortitude or self-mastery,
p287
aVhe borrowed from Julius II's wonderful collection of sculptures
p288
aVin order to show inner strength as external power.
p289
aa(lp290
VNow, one contemporary did write
p291
aVthat the chapel was too beautiful to not cause controversy.
p292
aVAnd so it did.
p293
aVMichelangelo soon found that thanks to the printing press,
p294
aVcomplaints about the nudity spread all over the place,
p295
aVand soon his masterpiece of human drama was labeled pornography,
p296
aVat which point he added two more portraits,
p297
aVone of the man who criticized him, a papal courtier,
p298
aVand the other one of himself as a dried up husk, no athlete,
p299
aVin the hands of a long-suffering martyr.
p300
aVThe year he died he saw several of these figures covered over,
p301
aVa triumph for trivial distractions over his great exhortation to glory.
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd so now we stand
p304
aVin the here and now.
p305
aVWe are caught in that space
p306
aVbetween beginnings and endings,
p307
aVin the great, huge totality of the human experience.
p308
aVThe Sistine Chapel forces us to look around as if it were a mirror.
p309
aVWho am I in this picture?
p310
aVAm I one of the crowd?
p311
aVAm I the drunk guy?
p312
aVAm I the athlete?
p313
aVAnd as we leave this haven of uplifting beauty,
p314
aVwe are inspired to ask ourselves life's biggest questions:
p315
aVWho am I, and what role do I play in this great theater of life?
p316
aa(lp317
VThank you.
p318
aa(lp319
V(Applause)
p320
aa(lp321
VBruno Giussani: Elizabeth Lev, thank you.
p322
aa(lp323
VElizabeth, you mentioned this whole issue of pornography,
p324
aVtoo many nudes and too many daily life scenes and improper things
p325
aVin the eyes of the time.
p326
aVBut actually the story is bigger.
p327
aVIt's not just touching up and covering up some of the figures.
p328
aVThis work of art was almost destroyed because of that.
p329
aa(lp330
VElizabeth Lev: The effect of the Last Judgment was enormous.
p331
aVThe printing press made sure that everybody saw it.
p332
aVAnd so, this wasn't something that happened within a couple of weeks.
p333
aVIt was something that happened over the space of 20 years
p334
aVof editorials and complaints,
p335
aVsaying to the Church,
p336
aV"You can't possibly tell us how to live our lives.
p337
aVDid you notice you have pornography in the Pope's chapel?"
p338
aVAnd so after complaints and insistence
p339
aVof trying to get this work destroyed,
p340
aVit was finally the year that Michelangelo died
p341
aVthat the Church finally found a compromise,
p342
aVa way to save the painting,
p343
aVand that was in putting up these extra 30 covers,
p344
aVand that happens to be the origin of fig-leafing.
p345
aVThat's where it all came about,
p346
aVand it came about from a church that was trying to save a work of art,
p347
aVnot indeed deface or destroyed it.
p348
aa(lp349
VBG: This, what you just gave us, is not the classic tour
p350
aVthat people get today when they go to the Sistine Chapel.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Laughter)
p353
aa(lp354
VEL: I don't know, is that an ad?
p355
aa(lp356
V(Laughter)
p357
aa(lp358
VBG: No, no, no, not necessarily, it is a statement.
p359
aVThe experience of art today is encountering problems.
p360
aVToo many people want to see this there,
p361
aVand the result is five million people going through that tiny door
p362
aVand experiencing it in a completely different way
p363
aVthan we just did.
p364
aa(lp365
VEL: Right. I agree. I think it's really nice to be able to pause and look.
p366
aVBut also realize, even when you're in those days,
p367
aVwith 28,000 people a day,
p368
aVeven those days when you're in there with all those other people,
p369
aVlook around you and think how amazing it is
p370
aVthat some painted plaster from 500 years ago
p371
aVcan still draw all those people standing side by side with you,
p372
aVlooking upwards with their jaws dropped.
p373
aVIt's a great statement about how beauty truly can speak to us all
p374
aVthrough time and through geographic space.
p375
aa(lp376
VBG: Liz, grazie.
p377
