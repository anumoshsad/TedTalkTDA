VTwenty-eight years ago, I was a broken man.
p4
aVAnd you probably wouldn't be able to tell that if you met me.
p5
aVI had a good job at a well-respected academic institution.
p6
aVI dressed well, of course.
p7
aVBut my insides were rotting away.
p8
aVYou see, I grew up in a family riddled with addiction,
p9
aVand as a kid, I also struggled
p10
aVwith coming to terms with my own sexuality.
p11
aVAnd even though I couldn't name it then,
p12
aVgrowing up as a gay kid
p13
aVjust compounded my issues of isolation and insecurities.
p14
aVBut drinking took all of that away.
p15
aa(lp16
VLike many, I drank at an early age.
p17
aVI continued to drink my way through college.
p18
aVAnd when I finally did come out in the early 1980s,
p19
aVabout the only places to meet other gay people,
p20
aVto socialize,
p21
aVto be yourself, were gay bars.
p22
aVAnd what do you do in gay bars?
p23
aVYou drink.
p24
aVAnd I did \u2014
p25
aVa lot.
p26
aa(lp27
VMy story is not unique.
p28
aVLike millions of Americans, my disease progressed undiagnosed.
p29
aVIt took me to people and places and things
p30
aVthat I never would have chosen.
p31
aVIt wasn't until an intersection with the law
p32
aVgave me an "opportunity" to get care,
p33
aVthat I began my journey of recovery.
p34
aa(lp35
VMy journey of recovery has been filled with love and with joy,
p36
aVbut it hasn't been without pain.
p37
aVLike many of you, I've lost too many friends and family to this disease.
p38
aVI've heard too many heartbreaking stories
p39
aVof people who've lost loved ones to addiction.
p40
aVAnd I've also lost countless friends to HIV and AIDS.
p41
aa(lp42
VOur current opioid epidemic and the AIDS epidemic
p43
aVtragically have much in common.
p44
aVRight now, we are in the midst of one of the greatest health crises of our time.
p45
aVDuring 2014 alone, 28,000 people
p46
aVdied of drug overdoses associated with prescription drugs and heroin.
p47
aVDuring the 1980s, scores of people were dying from HIV and AIDS.
p48
aVPublic officials ignored it.
p49
aVSome wouldn't even utter the words.
p50
aVThey didn't want treatment.
p51
aVAnd tragically, there are many parallels with our current epidemic.
p52
aVSome called it the gay plague.
p53
aVThey called for quarantines.
p54
aVThey wanted to separate the innocent victims from the rest of us.
p55
aVI was afraid we were losing this battle
p56
aVbecause people were blaming us for being sick.
p57
aVPublic policy was being held hostage by stigma and fear,
p58
aVand also held hostage
p59
aVwere compassion, care, research, recovery and treatment.
p60
aa(lp61
VBut we changed all that.
p62
aVBecause out of the pain of those deaths,
p63
aVwe saw a social and political movement.
p64
aVAIDS galvanized us into action;
p65
aVto stand up, to speak up and to act out.
p66
aVAnd it also galvanized the LGBT movement.
p67
aVWe knew we were in a battle for our lives
p68
aVbecause silence equaled death,
p69
aVbut we changed, and we made things happen.
p70
aVAnd right now, we have the potential
p71
aVto see the end of HIV/AIDS in our lifetime.
p72
aVThese changes came in no small part
p73
aVby the courageous, yet simple decision
p74
aVfor people to come out
p75
aVto their neighbors, to their friends, to their families
p76
aVand to their coworkers.
p77
aa(lp78
VYears ago, I was a volunteer for the Names Project.
p79
aVThis was an effort started by Cleve Jones in San Francisco
p80
aVto show that people who died of AIDS
p81
aVhad names
p82
aVand faces and families
p83
aVand people who loved them.
p84
aVI still recall unfolding the AIDS memorial quilt
p85
aVon the National Mall on a brilliant day in October, 1988.
p86
aa(lp87
VSo fast forward to 2015.
p88
aVThe Supreme Court's decision to strike down the ban on same-sex marriage.
p89
aVMy husband, Dave, and I walk over to the steps of the Supreme Court
p90
aVto celebrate that decision with so many other people,
p91
aVand I couldn't help but think how far we came around LGBT rights
p92
aVand yet how far we needed to go around issues of addiction.
p93
aa(lp94
VWhen I was nominated by President Obama
p95
aVto be his Director of Drug Policy,
p96
aVI was very open about my recovery and about the fact that I was a gay man.
p97
aVAnd at no point during my confirmation process \u2014
p98
aVat least that I know of \u2014
p99
aVdid the fact that I was a gay man come to bear on my candidacy
p100
aVor my fitness to do this job.
p101
aVBut my addiction did.
p102
aVAt one point, a congressional staffer said that there was no way
p103
aVthat I was going to be confirmed by the United States Senate
p104
aVbecause of my past,
p105
aVdespite the fact that I had been in recovery for over 20 years,
p106
aVand despite the fact
p107
aVthat this job takes a little bit of knowledge around addiction.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VSo, you know, this is the stigma
p112
aVthat people with substance use disorders
p113
aVface every single day,
p114
aVand you know, I have to tell you
p115
aVit's still why I'm more comfortable coming out as a gay man
p116
aVthan I am as a person with a history of addiction.
p117
aa(lp118
VNearly every family in America is affected by addiction.
p119
aVYet, unfortunately, too often, it's not talked about openly and honestly.
p120
aVIt's whispered about.
p121
aVIt's met with derision and scorn.
p122
aVWe hear these stories, time and time again, on TV, online,
p123
aVwe hear it from public officials, and we hear it from family and friends.
p124
aVAnd those of us with an addiction, we hear those voices,
p125
aVand somehow we believe that we are less deserving of care and treatment.
p126
aVToday in the United States, only one in nine people
p127
aVget care and treatment for their disorder.
p128
aVOne in nine.
p129
aVThink about that.
p130
aa(lp131
VGenerally, people with other diseases get care and treatment.
p132
aVIf you have cancer, you get treatment,
p133
aVif you have diabetes, you get treatment.
p134
aVIf you have a heart attack,
p135
aVyou get emergency services, and you get referred to care.
p136
aVBut somehow people with addiction have to wait for treatment
p137
aVor often can't get when they need it.
p138
aVAnd left untreated, addiction has significant, dire consequences.
p139
aVAnd for many people that means death or incarceration.
p140
aVWe've been down that road before.
p141
aa(lp142
VFor too long our country felt
p143
aVlike we could arrest our way out of this problem.
p144
aVBut we know that we can't.
p145
aVDecades of scientific research has shown
p146
aVthat this is a medical issue \u2014
p147
aVthat this is a chronic medical condition
p148
aVthat people inherit and that people develop.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo the Obama administration has taken a different tack on drug policy.
p151
aVWe've developed and implemented a comprehensive plan
p152
aVto expand prevention services, treatment services,
p153
aVearly intervention and recovery support.
p154
aVWe've pushed criminal justice reform.
p155
aVWe've knocked down barriers to give people second chances.
p156
aVWe see public health and public safety officials working hand in hand
p157
aVat the community level.
p158
aVWe see police chiefs across the country guiding people to treatment
p159
aVinstead of jail and incarceration.
p160
aVWe see law enforcement and other first responders
p161
aVreversing overdoses with naloxone to give people a second chance for care.
p162
aVThe Affordable Care Act is the biggest expansion
p163
aVof substance use disorder treatment in a generation,
p164
aVand it also calls for the integration of treatment services within primary care.
p165
aVBut fundamentally, all of this work is not enough.
p166
aVUnless we change the way that we view people with addiction
p167
aVin the United States.
p168
aa(lp169
VYears ago when I finally understood that I had a problem
p170
aVand I knew that I needed help,
p171
aVI was too afraid to ask for it.
p172
aVI felt that people would think I was stupid, that I was weak-willed,
p173
aVthat I was morally flawed.
p174
aVBut I talk about my recovery because I want to make change.
p175
aVI want us to see that we need to be open and candid about who we are
p176
aVand what we can do.
p177
aVI am public about my own recovery
p178
aVnot to be self-congratulatory.
p179
aVI am open about my own recovery to change public opinion,
p180
aVto change public policy
p181
aVand to change the course of this epidemic and empower the millions of Americans
p182
aVwho struggle with this journey
p183
aVto be open and candid about who they are.
p184
aVPeople are more than their disease.
p185
aVAnd all of us have the opportunity to change public opinion
p186
aVand to change public policy.
p187
aa(lp188
VAll of us know someone who has an addiction,
p189
aVand all of us can do our part
p190
aVto change how we view people with addiction in the United States.
p191
aVSo when you see someone with an addiction,
p192
aVdon't think of a drunk or a junkie or an addict or an abuser \u2014
p193
aVsee a person;
p194
aVoffer them help;
p195
aVgive them kindness and compassion.
p196
aVAnd together, we can be part
p197
aVof a growing movement in the United States
p198
aVto change how we view people with addiction.
p199
aa(lp200
VTogether we can change public policy.
p201
aVWe can ensure that people get care when they need it,
p202
aVjust like any other disease.
p203
aVWe can be part of a growing, unstoppable movement
p204
aVto have millions of Americans enter recovery,
p205
aVand put an end to this epidemic.
p206
aa(lp207
VThank you very much.
