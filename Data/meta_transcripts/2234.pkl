VThis is a story about capitalism.
p4
aVIt's a system I love
p5
aVbecause of the successes and opportunities it's afforded me and millions of others.
p6
aa(lp7
VI started in my 20s trading commodities, cotton in particular, in the pits,
p8
aVand if there was ever a free market free-for-all, this was it,
p9
aVwhere men wearing ties  but acting like gladiators
p10
aVfought literally  and physically for a profit.
p11
aa(lp12
VFortunately, I was good enough that by the time I was 30,
p13
aVI was able to move into the upstairs  world of money management,
p14
aVwhere I spent the next three decades as a global macro trader.
p15
aVAnd over that time, I've seen a lot of crazy things in the markets,
p16
aVand I've traded a lot of crazy manias.
p17
aVAnd unfortunately,
p18
aVI'm sad to report that right now  we might be in the grips
p19
aVof one of the most disastrous, certainly of my career,
p20
aVand one consistent takeaway is manias never end well.
p21
aa(lp22
VNow, over the past 50 years,
p23
aVwe as a society have come to view our companies and corporations
p24
aVin a very narrow, almost monomaniacal fashion
p25
aVwith regard to how we value them,
p26
aVand we have put so much emphasis on profits,
p27
aVon short-term quarterly earnings and share prices,
p28
aVat the exclusion of all else.
p29
aVIt's like we've ripped the humanity out of our companies.
p30
aVNow, we don't do that \u2014 conveniently reduce something
p31
aVto a set of numbers that you can play with like Lego toys \u2014
p32
aVwe don't do that in our individual life.
p33
aVWe don't treat somebody or value them
p34
aVbased on their monthly income  or their credit score,
p35
aVbut we have this double standard
p36
aVwhen it comes to the way that we value our businesses,
p37
aVand you know what?
p38
aVIt's threatening the very underpinnings of our society.
p39
aVAnd here's how you'll see.
p40
aa(lp41
VThis chart is corporate profit margins going back 40 years
p42
aVas a percentage of revenues,
p43
aVand you can see that we're at a 40-year high of 12.5 percent.
p44
aVNow, hooray if you're a shareholder,
p45
aVbut if you're the other side of that, and you're the average American worker,
p46
aVthen you can see it's not such a good thing.
p47
aV["U.S. Share of Income Going to Labor vs. CEO-to-Worker Compensation Ratio"]
p48
aa(lp49
VNow, higher profit margins do not increase societal wealth.
p50
aVWhat they actually do is they exacerbate income inequality,
p51
aVand that's not a good thing.
p52
aVBut intuitively, that makes sense, right?
p53
aVBecause if the top 10 percent of American families
p54
aVown 90 percent of the stocks,
p55
aVas they take a greater share of corporate profits,
p56
aVthen there's less wealth left for the rest of society.
p57
aa(lp58
VAgain, income inequality is not a good thing.
p59
aVThis next chart, made by The Equality Trust,
p60
aVshows 21 countries from Austria to Japan to New Zealand.
p61
aVOn the horizontal axis is income inequality.
p62
aVThe further to the right you go, the greater the income inequality.
p63
aVOn the vertical axis are nine social and health metrics.
p64
aVThe more you go up that, the worse the problems are,
p65
aVand those metrics include life expectancy, teenage pregnancy, literacy,
p66
aVsocial mobility, just to name a few.
p67
aVNow, those of you in the audience who are Americans may wonder,
p68
aVwell, where does the United States rank?
p69
aVWhere does it lie on that chart?
p70
aVAnd guess what?
p71
aVWe're literally off the chart.
p72
aVYes, that's us,
p73
aVwith the greatest income inequality
p74
aVand the greatest social problems, according to those metrics.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow, here's a macro forecast that's easy to make,
p77
aVand that's, that gap between the wealthiest and the poorest,
p78
aVit will get closed.
p79
aVHistory always does it.
p80
aVIt typically happens in one of three ways:
p81
aVeither through revolution, higher taxes, or wars.
p82
aVNone of those are on my bucket list.
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aa(lp85
VNow, there's another way to do it,
p86
aVand that's by increasing justness in corporate behavior,
p87
aVbut the way that we're operating right now,
p88
aVthat would require a tremendous change in behavior,
p89
aVand like an addict trying to kick a habit,
p90
aVthe first step is to acknowledge that you have a problem.
p91
aVAnd let me just say, this profits mania that we're on
p92
aVis so deeply entrenched
p93
aVthat we don't even realize how we're harming society.
p94
aVHere's a small but startling example of exactly how we're doing that:
p95
aVthis chart shows corporate giving
p96
aVas a percentage of profits,  not revenues, over the last 30 years.
p97
aVJuxtapose that to the earlier chart of corporate profit margins,
p98
aVand I ask you, does that feel right?
p99
aa(lp100
VIn all fairness, when I started writing this, I thought,
p101
aV"Oh wow, what does my company, what does Tudor do?"
p102
aVAnd I realized we give one percent of corporate profits
p103
aVto charity every year.
p104
aVAnd I'm supposed to be a philanthropist.
p105
aVWhen I realized that, I literally wanted to throw up.
p106
aVBut the point is, this mania is so deeply entrenched
p107
aVthat well-intentioned people like myself don't even realize that we're part of it.
p108
aa(lp109
VNow, we're not going to change corporate behavior
p110
aVby simply increasing corporate philanthropy or charitable contributions.
p111
aVAnd oh, by the way, we've since quadrupled that,
p112
aVbut \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 Please.
p113
aVBut we can do it by driving more just behavior.
p114
aVAnd one way to do it is actually trusting
p115
aVthe system that got us here in the first place,
p116
aVand that's the free market system.
p117
aVAbout a year ago, some friends of mine and I
p118
aVstarted a not-for-profit called Just Capital.
p119
aVIts mission is very simple:
p120
aVto help companies and corporations
p121
aVlearn how to operate in a more just fashion by using the public's input
p122
aVto define exactly what the criteria are for just corporate behavior.
p123
aVNow, right now, there's no widely accepted standard
p124
aVthat a company or corporation can follow, and that's where Just Capital comes in,
p125
aVbecause beginning this year and every year we'll be conducting a nationwide survey
p126
aVof a representative sample of 20,000 Americans
p127
aVto find out exactly what they think
p128
aVare the criteria for justness in corporate behavior.
p129
aVNow, this is a model that's going to start in the United States
p130
aVbut can be expanded anywhere around the globe,
p131
aVand maybe we'll find out
p132
aVthat the most important thing for the public
p133
aVis that we create living wage jobs, or make healthy products,
p134
aVor help, not harm, the environment.
p135
aVAt Just Capital, we don't know, and it's not for us to decide.
p136
aVWe're but messengers,
p137
aVbut we have 100 percent confidence  and faith in the American public
p138
aVto get it right.
p139
aVSo we'll release the findings this September for the first time,
p140
aVand then next year, we'll poll again,
p141
aVand we'll take the additive step this time
p142
aVof ranking the 1,000 largest U.S. companies
p143
aVfrom number one to number 1,000 and everything in between.
p144
aVWe're calling it the Just Index,
p145
aVand remember, we're an independent not-for-profit with no bias,
p146
aVand we will be giving the American public a voice.
p147
aVAnd maybe over time, we'll find out that as people come to know
p148
aVwhich companies are the most just,
p149
aVhuman and economic resources will be driven towards them,
p150
aVand they'll become the most prosperous
p151
aVand help our country be the most prosperous.
p152
aa(lp153
VNow, capitalism has been responsible for every major innovation
p154
aVthat's made this world a more inspiring and wonderful place to live in.
p155
aVCapitalism has to be based on justice.
p156
aVIt has to be, and now more than ever,
p157
aVwith economic divisions growing wider every day.
p158
aVIt's estimated that 47 percent of American workers
p159
aVcan be displaced in the next 20 years.
p160
aVI'm not against progress.
p161
aVI want the driverless car and the jet pack just like everyone else.
p162
aVBut I'm pleading for recognition that with increased wealth and profits
p163
aVhas to come greater corporate social responsibility.
p164
aa(lp165
V"If justice is removed," said Adam Smith, the father of capitalism,
p166
aV"the great, the immense fabric of human society must in a moment
p167
aVcrumble into atoms."
p168
aa(lp169
VNow, when I was young, and there was a problem,
p170
aVmy mama used to always sigh and shake her head and say,
p171
aV"Have mercy, have mercy."
p172
aVNow's not the time for us, for the rest of us to show them mercy.
p173
aVThe time is now for us to show them fairness,
p174
aVand we can do that, you and I,
p175
aVby starting where we work, in the businesses that we operate in.
p176
aVAnd when we put justness on par with profits,
p177
aVwe'll get the most wonderful thing in all the world.
p178
aVWe'll take back our humanity.
p179
aa(lp180
VThank you.
