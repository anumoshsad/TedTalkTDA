VIn the great 1980s movie  "The Blues Brothers,"
p4
aVthere's a scene where John Belushi goes to visit Dan Aykroyd in his apartment
p5
aVin Chicago for the very first time.
p6
aVIt's a cramped, tiny space
p7
aVand it's just three feet away from the train tracks.
p8
aVAs John sits on Dan's bed,
p9
aVa train goes rushing by,
p10
aVrattling everything in the room.
p11
aVJohn asks, "How often does that train go by?"
p12
aVDan replies, "So often, you won't even notice it."
p13
aVAnd then, something falls off the wall.
p14
aa(lp15
VWe all know what he's talking about.
p16
aVAs human beings, we get used to everyday things
p17
aVreally fast.
p18
aVAs a product designer, it's my job to see those everyday things,
p19
aVto feel them, and try to improve upon them.
p20
aVFor example, see this piece of fruit?
p21
aVSee this little sticker?
p22
aVThat sticker wasn't there when I was a kid.
p23
aVBut somewhere as the years passed,
p24
aVsomeone had the bright idea to put that sticker on the fruit.
p25
aVWhy?
p26
aVSo it could be easier for us
p27
aVto check out  at the grocery counter.
p28
aa(lp29
VWell that's great,
p30
aVwe can get in and out of the store quickly.
p31
aVBut now, there's a new problem.
p32
aVWhen we get home and we're hungry
p33
aVand we see this ripe, juicy piece of fruit on the counter,
p34
aVwe just want to pick it up and eat it.
p35
aVExcept now, we have to look for this little sticker.
p36
aVAnd dig at it with our nails, damaging the flesh.
p37
aVThen rolling up that sticker \u2014
p38
aVyou know what I mean.
p39
aVAnd then trying to flick it off your fingers.
p40
aV(Applause)
p41
aVIt's not fun,
p42
aVnot at all.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut something interesting happened.
p45
aVSee the first time you did it, you probably felt those feelings.
p46
aVYou just wanted to eat the piece of fruit.
p47
aVYou felt upset.
p48
aVYou just wanted to dive in.
p49
aVBy the 10th time,
p50
aVyou started to become less upset
p51
aVand you just started peeling the label off.
p52
aVBy the 100th time, at least for me,
p53
aVI became numb to it.
p54
aVI simply picked up the piece of fruit,
p55
aVdug at it with my nails, tried to flick it off,
p56
aVand then wondered,
p57
aV"Was there another sticker?"
p58
aa(lp59
VSo why is that?
p60
aVWhy do we get used to everyday things?
p61
aVWell as human beings, we have limited brain power.
p62
aVAnd so our brains encode the  everyday things we do into habits
p63
aVso we can free up space  to learn new things.
p64
aVIt's a process called habituation
p65
aVand it's one of the most basic ways, as humans, we learn.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow, habituation isn't always bad.
p68
aVRemember learning to drive?
p69
aVI sure do.
p70
aVYour hands clenched at 10 and 2 on the wheel,
p71
aVlooking at every single object out there \u2014
p72
aVthe cars, the lights, the pedestrians.
p73
aVIt's a nerve-wracking experience.
p74
aVSo much so, that I couldn't even talk to anyone else in the car
p75
aVand I couldn't even listen to music.
p76
aVBut then something interesting happened.
p77
aVAs the weeks went by, driving became easier and easier.
p78
aVYou habituated it.
p79
aVIt started to become  fun and second nature.
p80
aVAnd then, you could talk  to your friends again
p81
aVand listen to music.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo there's a good reason why our brains habituate things.
p84
aVIf we didn't, we'd notice every little detail,
p85
aVall the time.
p86
aVIt would be exhausting,
p87
aVand we'd have no time to learn about new things.
p88
aa(lp89
VBut sometimes, habituation isn't good.
p90
aVIf it stops us from noticing  the problems that are around us,
p91
aVwell, that's bad.
p92
aVAnd if it stops us from noticing  and fixing those problems,
p93
aVwell, then that's really bad.
p94
aa(lp95
VComedians know all about this.
p96
aVJerry Seinfeld's entire career was built on noticing those little details,
p97
aVthose idiotic things we do every day that we don't even remember.
p98
aVHe tells us about the time  he visited his friends
p99
aVand he just wanted to take  a comfortable shower.
p100
aVHe'd reach out and grab the handle and turn it slightly one way,
p101
aVand it was 100 degrees too hot.
p102
aVAnd then he'd turn it the other way, and it was 100 degrees too cold.
p103
aVHe just wanted a comfortable shower.
p104
aVNow, we've all been there,
p105
aVwe just don't remember it.
p106
aVBut Jerry did,
p107
aVand that's a comedian's job.
p108
aa(lp109
VBut designers, innovators  and entrepreneurs,
p110
aVit's our job to not just notice those things,
p111
aVbut to go one step further and try to fix them.
p112
aa(lp113
VSee this, this person,
p114
aVthis is Mary Anderson.
p115
aVIn 1902 in New York City,
p116
aVshe was visiting.
p117
aVIt was a cold, wet, snowy day and she was warm inside a streetcar.
p118
aVAs she was going to her destination, she noticed the driver opening the window
p119
aVto clean off the excess snow so he could drive safely.
p120
aVWhen he opened the window, though, he let all this cold, wet air inside,
p121
aVmaking all the passengers miserable.
p122
aVNow probably, most of those  passengers just thought,
p123
aV"It's a fact of life, he's got to open the window to clean it.
p124
aVThat's just how it is."
p125
aVBut Mary didn't.
p126
aVMary thought,
p127
aV"What if the diver could actually clean the windshield from the inside
p128
aVso that he could stay safe and drive
p129
aVand the passengers could  actually stay warm?"
p130
aVSo she picked up her sketchbook right then and there,
p131
aVand began drawing what would become the world's first windshield wiper.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow as a product designer, I try to learn from people like Mary
p134
aVto try to see the world  the way it really is,
p135
aVnot the way we think it is.
p136
aVWhy?
p137
aVBecause it's easy to solve a problem that almost everyone sees.
p138
aVBut it's hard to solve a problem that almost no one sees.
p139
aa(lp140
VNow some people think you're born with this ability
p141
aVor you're not,
p142
aVas if Mary Anderson was hardwired at birth to see the world more clearly.
p143
aVThat wasn't the case for me.
p144
aVI had to work at it.
p145
aVDuring my years at Apple,
p146
aVSteve Jobs challenged us to come into work every day,
p147
aVto see our products through  the eyes of the customer,
p148
aVthe new customer,
p149
aVthe one that has fears  and possible frustrations
p150
aVand hopeful exhilaration that their new technology product
p151
aVcould work straightaway for them.
p152
aVHe called it staying beginners,
p153
aVand wanted to make sure that we focused on those tiny little details
p154
aVto make them faster, easier and seamless for the new customers.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo I remember this clearly in the very earliest days of the iPod.
p157
aVSee, back in the '90s,
p158
aVbeing a gadget freak like I am,
p159
aVI would rush out to the store for the very, very latest gadget.
p160
aVI'd take all the time to get to the store,
p161
aVI'd check out, I'd come back home, I'd start to unbox it.
p162
aVAnd then, there was  another little sticker:
p163
aVthe one that said, "Charge before use."
p164
aa(lp165
VWhat!
p166
aVI can't believe it!
p167
aVI just spent all this time buying this product
p168
aVand now I have to charge before use.
p169
aVI have to wait what felt like an eternity to use that coveted new toy.
p170
aVIt was crazy.
p171
aa(lp172
VBut you know what?
p173
aVAlmost every product back then did that.
p174
aVWhen it had batteries in it,
p175
aVyou had to charge it before you used it.
p176
aVWell, Steve noticed that
p177
aVand he said,
p178
aV"We're not going to let that  happen to our product."
p179
aVSo what did we do?
p180
aVTypically, when you have a product that has a hard drive in it,
p181
aVyou run it for about  30 minutes in the factory
p182
aVto make sure that hard drive's going  to be working years later
p183
aVfor the customer after they  pull it out of the box.
p184
aVWhat did we do instead?
p185
aVWe ran that product for over two hours.
p186
aVWhy?
p187
aVWell, first off, we could make a higher quality product,
p188
aVbe easy to test,
p189
aVand make sure it was great for the customer.
p190
aVBut most importantly,
p191
aVthe battery came fully charged right out of the box,
p192
aVready to use.
p193
aVSo that customer,  with all that exhilaration,
p194
aVcould just start using the product.
p195
aVIt was great, and it worked.
p196
aVPeople liked it.
p197
aa(lp198
VToday, almost every product that you get that's battery powered
p199
aVcomes out of the box fully charged,
p200
aVeven if it doesn't have a hard drive.
p201
aVBut back then, we noticed  that detail and we fixed it,
p202
aVand now everyone else does that as well.
p203
aVNo more, "Charge before use."
p204
aa(lp205
VSo why am I telling you this?
p206
aVWell, it's seeing the invisible problem,
p207
aVnot just the obvious problem, that's important,
p208
aVnot just for product design, but for everything we do.
p209
aVYou see, there are invisible problems all around us,
p210
aVones we can solve.
p211
aVBut first we need to see them, to feel them.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo, I'm hesitant to give you any tips
p214
aVabout neuroscience or psychology.
p215
aVThere's far too many experienced people in the TED community
p216
aVwho would know much more about that than I ever will.
p217
aVBut let me leave you with a few tips that I do,
p218
aVthat we all can do, to fight habituation.
p219
aa(lp220
VMy first tip is to look broader.
p221
aVYou see, when you're tackling a problem,
p222
aVsometimes, there are a lot of steps that lead up to that problem.
p223
aVAnd sometimes, a lot  of steps after it.
p224
aVIf you can take a step back and look broader,
p225
aVmaybe you can change some of those boxes
p226
aVbefore the problem.
p227
aVMaybe you can combine them.
p228
aVMaybe you can remove them altogether to make that better.
p229
aa(lp230
VTake thermostats, for instance.
p231
aVIn the 1900s when they first came out, they were really simple to use.
p232
aVYou could turn them up or turn them down.
p233
aVPeople understood them.
p234
aVBut in the 1970s,
p235
aVthe energy crisis struck,
p236
aVand customers started thinking about how to save energy.
p237
aVSo what happened?
p238
aVThermostat designers decided  to add a new step.
p239
aVInstead of just turning up and down,
p240
aVyou now had to program it.
p241
aVSo you could tell it the temperature you wanted at a certain time.
p242
aVNow that seemed great.
p243
aVEvery thermostat had started adding that feature.
p244
aVBut it turned out that no one saved any energy.
p245
aVNow, why is that?
p246
aVWell, people couldn't predict the future.
p247
aVThey just didn't know how their weeks would change season to season,
p248
aVyear to year.
p249
aVSo no one was saving energy,
p250
aVand what happened?
p251
aa(lp252
VThermostat designers went back to the drawing board
p253
aVand they focused on that programming step.
p254
aVThey made better U.I.s,
p255
aVthey made better documentation.
p256
aVBut still, years later, people were not saving any energy
p257
aVbecause they just couldn't predict the future.
p258
aVSo what did we do?
p259
aVWe put a machine-learning algorithm in instead of the programming
p260
aVthat would simply watch when you turned it up and down,
p261
aVwhen you liked a certain temperature when you got up,
p262
aVor when you went away.
p263
aVAnd you know what?
p264
aVIt worked.
p265
aVPeople are saving energy  without any programming.
p266
aa(lp267
VSo, it doesn't matter what you're doing.
p268
aVIf you take a step back  and look at all the boxes,
p269
aVmaybe there's a way to remove one or combine them
p270
aVso that you can make  that process much simpler.
p271
aVSo that's my first tip: look broader.
p272
aa(lp273
VFor my second tip, it's to look closer.
p274
aVOne of my greatest teachers  was my grandfather.
p275
aVHe taught me all about the world.
p276
aVHe taught me how things were built and how they were repaired,
p277
aVthe tools and techniques necessary to make a successful project.
p278
aVI remember one story  he told me about screws,
p279
aVand about how you need to have the right screw for the right job.
p280
aVThere are many different screws:
p281
aVwood screws, metal screws, anchors, concrete screws,
p282
aVthe list went on and on.
p283
aVOur job is to make products that are easy to install
p284
aVfor all of our customs themselves without professionals.
p285
aVSo what did we do?
p286
aVI remembered that story  that my grandfather told me,
p287
aVand so we thought,
p288
aV"How many different screws  can we put in the box?
p289
aVWas it going to be two, three, four, five?
p290
aVBecause there's so many different wall types."
p291
aVSo we thought about it, we optimized it,
p292
aVand we came up with three different screws to put in the box.
p293
aVWe thought that was going to solve the problem.
p294
aVBut it turned out, it didn't.
p295
aa(lp296
VSo we shipped the product,
p297
aVand people weren't having a great experience.
p298
aVSo what did we do?
p299
aVWe went back to the drawing board
p300
aVjust instantly after we figured out we didn't get it right.
p301
aVAnd we designed a special screw, a custom screw,
p302
aVmuch to the chagrin of our investors.
p303
aVThey were like, "Why are you spending so much time on a little screw?
p304
aVGet out there and sell more!"
p305
aVAnd we said, "We will sell more if we get this right."
p306
aVAnd it turned out, we did.
p307
aVWith that custom little screw, there was just one screw in the box,
p308
aVthat was easy to mount and put on the wall.
p309
aa(lp310
VSo if we focus on those tiny details, the ones we may not see
p311
aVand we look at them as we say,
p312
aV"Are those important
p313
aVor is that the way we've always done it?
p314
aVMaybe there's a way to get rid of those."
p315
aa(lp316
VSo my last piece of advice is to think younger.
p317
aVEvery day, I'm confronted with interesting questions from my three young kids.
p318
aVThey come up with questions like,
p319
aV"Why can't cars fly around traffic?"
p320
aVOr, "Why don't my shoelaces have Velcro instead?"
p321
aVSometimes, those questions are smart.
p322
aVMy son came to me the other day and I asked him,
p323
aV"Go run out to the mailbox  and check it."
p324
aVHe looked at me, puzzled, and said,
p325
aV"Why doesn't the mailbox just check itself and tell us when it has mail?" (Laughter)
p326
aVI was like, "That's a pretty  good question."
p327
aVSo, they can ask tons of questions
p328
aVand sometimes we find out we just don't have the right answers.
p329
aVWe say, "Son, that's just the way the world works."
p330
aVSo the more we're exposed to something,
p331
aVthe more we get used to it.
p332
aVBut kids haven't been around  long enough
p333
aVto get used to those things.
p334
aVAnd so when they run into problems,
p335
aVthey immediately try to solve them,
p336
aVand sometimes they find a better way,
p337
aVand that way really is better.
p338
aa(lp339
VSo my advice that we take to heart is to have young people on your team,
p340
aVor people with young minds.
p341
aVBecause if you have those young minds,
p342
aVthey cause everyone in the room to think younger.
p343
aVPicasso once said,  "Every child is an artist.
p344
aVThe problem is when he or she grows up, is how to remain an artist."
p345
aVWe all saw the world more clearly when we saw it for the first time,
p346
aVbefore a lifetime of habits  got in the way.
p347
aVOur challenge is to get back there,
p348
aVto feel that frustration,
p349
aVto see those little details,
p350
aVto look broader,
p351
aVlook closer,
p352
aVand to think younger
p353
aVso we can stay beginners.
p354
aa(lp355
VIt's not easy.
p356
aVIt requires us pushing back
p357
aVagainst one of the most basic ways we make sense of the world.
p358
aVBut if we do,
p359
aVwe could do some pretty amazing things.
p360
aVFor me, hopefully, that's better product design.
p361
aVFor you, that could mean something else, something powerful.
p362
aa(lp363
VOur challenge is to wake up  each day and say,
p364
aV"How can I experience the world better?"
p365
aVAnd if we do, maybe, just maybe,
p366
aVwe can get rid of these dumb little stickers.
p367
aa(lp368
VThank you very much.
