p22
aa(lp23
VThank you very much, thanks for the warm welcome.
p24
aVThat dive you just watched is a journey \u2014
p25
aVa journey between two breaths.
p26
aVA journey that takes place between two breaths \u2014
p27
aVthe last one before diving into the water,
p28
aVand the first one, coming back to the surface.
p29
aVThat dive is a journey to the very limits of human possibility,
p30
aVa journey into the unknown.
p31
aVBut it's also, and above all, an inner journey,
p32
aVwhere a number of things happen,
p33
aVphysiologically as well as mentally.
p34
aVAnd that's why I'm here today,
p35
aVto share my journey with you and to take you along with me.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo, we start with the last breath.
p38
aV(Breathing in)
p39
aV(Breathing out)
p40
aVAs you noticed, that last breath in is slow, deep and intense.
p41
aVIt ends with a special technique called the carp,
p42
aVwhich allows me to store one to two extra liters of air in my lungs
p43
aVby compressing it.
p44
aVWhen I leave the surface, I have about 10 liters of air in my lungs.
p45
aVAs soon as I leave the surface the first mechanism kicks in:
p46
aVthe diving reflex.
p47
aVThe first thing the diving reflex does is make your heart rate drop.
p48
aVMy heart beat will drop from about 60-70 per minute
p49
aVto about 30-40 beats per minute
p50
aVin a matter of seconds; almost immediately.
p51
aa(lp52
VNext, the diving reflex causes peripheral vasoconstriction,
p53
aVwhich means that the blood flow will leave the body's extremities
p54
aVto feed the most important organs:
p55
aVthe lungs, the heart and the brain.
p56
aVThis mechanism is innate.
p57
aVI cannot control it.
p58
aVIf you go underwater, even if you've never done it before,
p59
aVyou'll experience the exact same effects.
p60
aVAll human beings share this characteristic.
p61
aVAnd what's extraordinary
p62
aVis that we share this instinct with marine mammals \u2014
p63
aVall marine mammals: dolphins, whales, sea lions, etc.
p64
aVWhen they dive deep into the ocean, these mechanisms become activated,
p65
aVbut to a greater extent.
p66
aVAnd, of course, it works much better for them.
p67
aVIt's absolutely fascinating.
p68
aa(lp69
VRight as I leave the surface,
p70
aVnature gives me a push in the right direction,
p71
aVallowing me to descend with confidence.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo as I dive deeper into the blue,
p74
aVthe pressure slowly starts to squeeze my lungs.
p75
aVAnd since it's the amount of air in my lungs that makes me float,
p76
aVthe farther down I go, the more pressure there is on my lungs,
p77
aVthe less air they contain and the easier it is for my body to fall.
p78
aVAnd at one point, around 35 or 40 meters down,
p79
aVI don't even need to swim.
p80
aVMy body is dense and heavy enough to fall into the depths by itself,
p81
aVand I enter what's called the free fall phase.
p82
aVThe free fall phase is the best part of the dive.
p83
aVIt's the reason I still dive.
p84
aVBecause it feels like you're being pulled down
p85
aVand you don't need to do anything.
p86
aVI can go from 35 meters to 123 meters without making a single movement.
p87
aVI let myself be pulled by the depths,
p88
aVand it feels like I'm flying underwater.
p89
aVIt's truly an amazing feeling \u2014 an extraordinary feeling of freedom.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd so I slowly continue sliding to the bottom.
p92
aV40 meters down,
p93
aV50 meters down,
p94
aVand between 50 and 60 meters, a second physiological response kicks in.
p95
aVMy lungs reach residual volume,
p96
aVbelow which they're not supposed to be compressed, in theory.
p97
aVAnd this second response is called blood shift,
p98
aVor "pulmonary erection" in French.
p99
aVI prefer "blood shift."
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VSo blood shift \u2014 how does it work?
p104
aVThe capillaries in the lungs become engorged with blood \u2014
p105
aVwhich is caused by the suction \u2014
p106
aVso the lungs can harden
p107
aVand protect the whole chest cavity from being crushed.
p108
aVIt prevents the two walls of the lungs from collapsing,
p109
aVfrom sticking together and caving in.
p110
aVThanks to this phenomenon, which we also share with marine mammals,
p111
aVI'm able to continue with my dive.
p112
aa(lp113
V60, 70 meters down, I keep falling, faster and faster,
p114
aVbecause the pressure is crushing my body more and more.
p115
aVBelow 80 meters,
p116
aVthe pressure becomes a lot stronger,
p117
aVand I start to feel it physically.
p118
aVI really start to feel the suffocation.
p119
aVYou can see what it looks like \u2014 not pretty at all.
p120
aVThe diaphragm is completely collapsed, the rib cage is squeezed in,
p121
aVand mentally, there is something going on as well.
p122
aa(lp123
VYou may be thinking, "This doesn't look enjoyable.
p124
aVHow do you do it?"
p125
aVIf I relied on my earthly reflexes \u2014
p126
aVwhat do we do above water when there's a problem?
p127
aVWe resist, we go against it.
p128
aVWe fight.
p129
aVUnderwater, that doesn't work.
p130
aVIf you try that underwater, you might tear your lungs,
p131
aVspit up blood, develop an edema
p132
aVand you'll have to stop diving for a good amount of time.
p133
aVSo what you need to do, mentally, is to tell yourself
p134
aVthat nature and the elements are stronger than you.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd so I let the water crush me.
p137
aVI accept the pressure and go with it.
p138
aVAt this point, my body receives this information,
p139
aVand my lungs start relaxing.
p140
aVI relinquish all control, and relax completely.
p141
aVThe pressure starts crushing me, and it doesn't feel bad at all.
p142
aVI even feel like I'm in a cocoon, protected.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd the dive continues.
p145
aV80, 85 meters down,
p146
aV90,
p147
aV100.
p148
aV100 meters \u2014 the magic number.
p149
aVIn every sport, it's a magic number.
p150
aVFor swimmers and athletes and also for us, free divers,
p151
aVit's a number everyone dreams of.
p152
aVEveryone wishes one day to be able to get to 100 meters.
p153
aVAnd it's a symbolic number for us,
p154
aVbecause in the 1970s, doctors and physiologists did their math,
p155
aVand predicted that the human body would not be able to go below 100 meters.
p156
aVBelow that, they said, the human body would implode.
p157
aVAnd then the Frenchman, Jacques Mayol \u2014
p158
aVyou all know him as the hero in "The Big Blue" \u2014
p159
aVcame along and dived down to 100 meters.
p160
aVHe even reached 105 meters.
p161
aVAt that time, he was doing "no limits."
p162
aVHe'd use weights to descend faster and come back up with a balloon,
p163
aVjust like in the movie.
p164
aVToday, we go down 200 meters in no limit free diving.
p165
aVI can do 123 meters by simply using muscle strength.
p166
aVAnd in a way, it's all thanks to him, because he challenged known facts,
p167
aVand with a sweep of his hand, got rid of the theoretical beliefs
p168
aVand all the mental limits that we like to impose on ourselves.
p169
aVHe showed us that the human body has an infinite ability to adapt.
p170
aa(lp171
VSo I carry on with my dive.
p172
aV105, 110, 115.
p173
aVThe bottom is getting closer.
p174
aV120,
p175
aV123 meters.
p176
aVI'm at the bottom.
p177
aa(lp178
VAnd now, I'd like to ask you to join me and put yourself in my place.
p179
aVClose your eyes.
p180
aVImagine you get to 123 meters.
p181
aVThe surface is far, far away.
p182
aVYou're alone.
p183
aVThere's hardly any light.
p184
aVIt's cold \u2014
p185
aVfreezing cold.
p186
aVThe pressure is crushing you completely \u2014
p187
aV13 times stronger than on the surface.
p188
aVAnd I know what you're thinking:
p189
aV"This is horrible.
p190
aVWhat the hell am I doing here?
p191
aVHe's insane."
p192
aVBut no.
p193
aVThat's not what I think when I'm down there.
p194
aVWhen I'm at the bottom, I feel good.
p195
aVI get this extraordinary feeling of well-being.
p196
aVMaybe it's because I've completely released all tensions
p197
aVand let myself go.
p198
aVI feel great, without the need to breathe.
p199
aa(lp200
VAlthough, you'd agree, I should be worried.
p201
aVI feel like a tiny dot, a little drop of water,
p202
aVfloating in the middle of the ocean.
p203
aVAnd each time, I picture the same image.
p204
aV[The Pale Blue Dot]
p205
aVIt's that small dot the arrow is pointing to.
p206
aVDo you know what it is?
p207
aVIt's planet Earth.
p208
aVPlanet Earth, photographed by the Voyager probe,
p209
aVfrom 4 billion kilometers away.
p210
aVAnd it shows that our home is that small dot over there,
p211
aVfloating in the middle of nothing.
p212
aa(lp213
VThat's how I feel
p214
aVwhen I'm at the bottom, at 123 meters.
p215
aVI feel like a small dot,
p216
aVa speck of dust, stardust,
p217
aVfloating in the middle of the cosmos,
p218
aVin the middle of nothing, in the immensity of space.
p219
aVIt's a fascinating sensation,
p220
aVbecause when I look up, down, left, right, in front, behind,
p221
aVI see the same thing: the infinite deep blue.
p222
aVNowhere else on Earth you can experience this \u2014
p223
aVlooking all around you, and seeing the same thing.
p224
aVIt's extraordinary.
p225
aVAnd at that moment,
p226
aVI still get that feeling each time, building up inside of me \u2014
p227
aVthe feeling of humility.
p228
aa(lp229
VLooking at this picture, I feel very humble \u2014
p230
aVjust like when I'm all the way down at the bottom \u2014
p231
aVbecause I'm nothing,
p232
aVI'm a little speck of nothingness lost in all of time and space.
p233
aVAnd it still is absolutely fascinating.
p234
aVI decide to go back to the surface, because this is not where I belong.
p235
aVI belong up there, on the surface.
p236
aa(lp237
VSo I start heading back up.
p238
aVI get something of a shock
p239
aVat the very moment when I decide to go up.
p240
aVFirst, because it takes a huge effort to tear yourself away from the bottom.
p241
aVIt pulled you down on the way in,
p242
aVand will do the same on the way up.
p243
aVYou have to swim twice as hard.
p244
aVThen, I'm hit with another phenomenon known as narcosis.
p245
aVI don't know if you've heard of that.
p246
aVIt's called nitrogen narcosis.
p247
aVIt's something that happens to scuba divers,
p248
aVbut it can happen to free divers.
p249
aVIt's caused by nitrogen dissolving in the blood,
p250
aVwhich causes confusion
p251
aVbetween the conscious and unconscious mind.
p252
aVA flurry of thoughts goes spinning through your head.
p253
aVYou can't control them, and you shouldn't try to \u2014
p254
aVyou have to let it happen.
p255
aVThe more you try to control it, the harder it is to manage.
p256
aVThen, a third thing happens:
p257
aVthe desire to breathe.
p258
aVI'm not a fish, I'm a human being,
p259
aVand the desire to breathe reminds me of that fact.
p260
aVAround 60, 70 meters,
p261
aVyou start to feel the need to breathe.
p262
aVAnd with everything else that's going on,
p263
aVyou can very easily lose your ground
p264
aVand start to panic.
p265
aVWhen that happens, you think, "Where's the surface?
p266
aVI want to go up. I want to breathe now."
p267
aVYou should not do that.
p268
aVNever look up to the surface \u2014
p269
aVnot with your eyes, or your mind.
p270
aVYou should never picture yourself up there.
p271
aVYou have to stay in the present.
p272
aVI look at the rope right in front of me, leading me back to the surface.
p273
aVAnd I focus on that, on the present moment.
p274
aVBecause if I think about the surface, I panic.
p275
aVAnd if I panic, it's over.
p276
aVTime goes faster this way.
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd at 30 meters: deliverance.
p279
aVI'm not alone any more.
p280
aVThe safety divers, my guardian angels, join me.
p281
aVThey leave the surface, we meet at 30 meters,
p282
aVand they escort me for the final few meters,
p283
aVwhere potential problems could arise.
p284
aVEvery time I see them, I think to myself,
p285
aV"It's thanks to you."
p286
aVIt's thanks to them, my team, that I'm here.
p287
aVIt brings back the sense of humility.
p288
aVWithout my team, without all the people around me,
p289
aVthe adventure into the deep would be impossible.
p290
aVA journey into the deep is above all a group effort.
p291
aa(lp292
VSo I'm happy to finish my journey with them,
p293
aVbecause I wouldn't be here if it weren't for them.
p294
aV20 meters, 10 meters,
p295
aVmy lungs slowly return to their normal volume.
p296
aVBuoyancy pushes me up to the surface.
p297
aVFive meters below the surface, I start to breathe out,
p298
aVso that as soon as I get to the surface all I do is breathe in.
p299
aVAnd so I arrive at the surface.
p300
aV(Breathing in)
p301
aVAir floods into my lungs.
p302
aVIt's like being born again, a relief.
p303
aVIt feels good.
p304
aVThough the journey was extraordinary,
p305
aVI do need to feel those small oxygen molecules fueling my body.
p306
aVIt's an extraordinary sensation, but at the same time it's traumatizing.
p307
aVIt's a shock to the system, as you can you imagine.
p308
aVI go from complete darkness to the light of day,
p309
aVfrom the near-silence of the depths to the commotion up top.
p310
aVIn terms of touch, I go from the soft, velvety feeling of the water,
p311
aVto air rubbing across my face.
p312
aVIn terms of smell,
p313
aVthere is air rushing into my lungs.
p314
aa(lp315
VAnd in return, my lungs open up.
p316
aVThey were completely squashed just 90 seconds ago,
p317
aVand now, they've opened up again.
p318
aVSo all of this affects quite a lot of things.
p319
aVI need a few seconds to come back,
p320
aVand to feel "all there" again.
p321
aVBut that needs to happen quickly,
p322
aVbecause the judges are there to verify my performance;
p323
aVI need to show them I'm in perfect physical condition.
p324
aVYou saw in the video, I was doing a so-called exit protocol.
p325
aVOnce at the surface, I have 15 seconds to take off my nose clip,
p326
aVgive this signal and say (English) "I am OK."
p327
aVPlus, you need to be bilingual.
p328
aa(lp329
V(Laughter)
p330
aa(lp331
VOn top of everything \u2014
p332
aVthat's not very nice.
p333
aVOnce the protocol is completed, the judges show me a white card,
p334
aVand that's when the joy starts.
p335
aVI can finally celebrate what has just happened.
p336
aa(lp337
VSo, the journey I've just described to you
p338
aVis a more extreme version of free diving.
p339
aVLuckily, it's far from just that.
p340
aVFor the past few years,
p341
aVI've been trying to show another side of free diving,
p342
aVbecause the media mainly talks about competitions and records.
p343
aVBut free diving is more than just that.
p344
aVIt's about being at ease in the water.
p345
aVIt's extremely beautiful, very poetic and artistic.
p346
aa(lp347
VSo my wife and I decided to film it
p348
aVand try to show another side of it,
p349
aVmostly to make people want to go into the water.
p350
aVLet me show you some images to finish my story.
p351
aVIt's a mix of beautiful underwater photos.
p352
aa(lp353
V(Music)
p354
aa(lp355
VI'd like you to know that if one day you try to stop breathing,
p356
aVyou'll realize that when you stop breathing,
p357
aVyou stop thinking, too.
p358
aVIt calms your mind.
p359
aa(lp360
VToday, in the 21st century, we're under so much pressure.
p361
aVOur minds are overworked, we think at a million miles an hour,
p362
aVwe're always stressed.
p363
aVBeing able to free dive lets you, just for a moment,
p364
aVrelax your mind.
p365
aVHolding your breath underwater
p366
aVmeans giving yourself the chance to experience weightlessness.
p367
aVIt means being underwater, floating,
p368
aVwith your body completely relaxed, letting go of all your tensions.
p369
aVThis is our plight in the 21st century:
p370
aVour backs hurt, our necks hurt, everything hurts,
p371
aVbecause we're stressed and tense all the time.
p372
aVBut when you're in the water,
p373
aVyou let yourself float, as if you were in space.
p374
aVYou let yourself go completely.
p375
aVIt's an extraordinary feeling.
p376
aVYou can finally get in touch with your body, mind and spirit.
p377
aVEverything feels better, all at once.
p378
aa(lp379
VLearning how to free dive is also about learning to breathe correctly.
p380
aVWe breathe with our first breath at birth, up until our last one.
p381
aVBreathing gives rhythm to our lives.
p382
aVLearning how to breathe better is learning how to live better.
p383
aVHolding your breath in the sea, not necessarily at 100 meters,
p384
aVbut maybe at two or three,
p385
aVputting on your goggles, a pair of flippers,
p386
aVmeans you can go see another world,
p387
aVanother universe, completely magical.
p388
aVYou can see little fish, seaweed, the flora and fauna,
p389
aVyou can watch it all discreetly,
p390
aVsliding underwater, looking around, and coming back to the surface,
p391
aVleaving no trace.
p392
aVIt's an amazing feeling to become one with nature like that.
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd if I may say one more thing,
p395
aVholding your breath, being in the water, finding this underwater world \u2014
p396
aVit's all about connecting with yourself.
p397
aVYou heard me talk a lot about the body's memory
p398
aVthat dates back millions of years, to our marine origins.
p399
aVThe day you get back into the water,
p400
aVwhen you hold your breath for a few seconds,
p401
aVyou will reconnect with those origins.
p402
aVAnd I guarantee
p403
aVit's absolute magic.
p404
aVI encourage you to try it out.
p405
