VThere was a time in my life
p4
aVwhen everything seemed perfect.
p5
aVEverywhere I went, I felt at home.
p6
aVEveryone I met,
p7
aVI felt I knew them for as long as I could remember.
p8
aVAnd I want to share with you how I came to that place
p9
aVand what I've learned since I left it.
p10
aa(lp11
VThis is where it began.
p12
aVAnd it raises an existential question,
p13
aVwhich is, if I'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness,
p14
aVwhy am I not visible in the photograph,
p15
aVand where is this time and place?
p16
aVThis is Los Angeles, California, where I live.
p17
aVThis is a police photo. That's actually my car.
p18
aVWe're less than a mile from one of the largest hospitals in Los Angeles,
p19
aVcalled Cedars-Sinai.
p20
aVAnd the situation is that a car full of paramedics
p21
aVon their way home from the hospital after work
p22
aVhave run across the wreckage,
p23
aVand they've advised the police
p24
aVthat there were no survivors inside the car,
p25
aVthat the driver's dead, that I'm dead.
p26
aVAnd the police are waiting for the fire department to arrive
p27
aVto cut apart the vehicle
p28
aVto extract the body of the driver.
p29
aVAnd when they do, they find that behind the glass,
p30
aVthey find me.
p31
aVAnd my skull's crushed and my collar bone is crushed;
p32
aVall but two of my ribs,
p33
aVmy pelvis and both arms \u2014
p34
aVthey're all crushed, but there is still a pulse.
p35
aVAnd they get me to that nearby hospital,
p36
aVCedars-Sinai,
p37
aVwhere that night I receive, because of my internal bleeding,
p38
aV45 units of blood \u2014
p39
aVwhich means full replacements of all the blood in me \u2014
p40
aVbefore they're able to staunch the flow.
p41
aVI'm put on full life support,
p42
aVand I have a massive stroke,
p43
aVand my brain drops into a coma.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow comas are measured
p46
aVon a scale from 15 down to three.
p47
aVFifteen is a mild coma. Three is the deepest.
p48
aVAnd if you look, you'll see that there's only one way you can score three.
p49
aVIt's essentially there's no sign of life
p50
aVfrom outside at all.
p51
aVI spent more than a month in a Glasgow Coma Scale three,
p52
aVand it is inside that deepest level of coma,
p53
aVon the rim between my life and my death,
p54
aVthat I'm experiencing the full connection and full consciousness
p55
aVof inner space.
p56
aa(lp57
VFrom my family looking in from outside,
p58
aVwhat they're trying to figure out
p59
aVis a different kind of existential question,
p60
aVwhich is, how far is it going to be possible to bridge
p61
aVfrom the comatose potential mind that they're looking at
p62
aVto an actual mind,
p63
aVwhich I define simply
p64
aVas the functioning of the brain
p65
aVthat is remaining inside my head.
p66
aVNow to put this into a broader context,
p67
aVI want you to imagine that you are an eternal alien
p68
aVwatching the Earth from outer space,
p69
aVand your favorite show on intergalactic satellite television
p70
aVis the Earth channel,
p71
aVand your favorite show is the Human Show.
p72
aVAnd the reason I think it would be so interesting to you
p73
aVis because consciousness is so interesting.
p74
aVIt's so unpredictable
p75
aVand so fragile.
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd this is how we began.
p78
aVWe all began in the Awash Valley in Ethiopia.
p79
aVThe show began with tremendous special effects,
p80
aVbecause there were catastrophic climate shifts \u2014
p81
aVwhich sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today.
p82
aVBecause of the Earth tilting on its axis
p83
aVand those catastrophic climate shifts,
p84
aVwe had to figure out how to find better food,
p85
aVand we had to learn \u2014 there's Lucy; that's how we all began \u2014
p86
aVwe had to learn how to crack open animal bones,
p87
aVuse tools to do that, to feed on the marrow,
p88
aVto grow our brains more.
p89
aVSo we actually grew our consciousness
p90
aVin response to this global threat.
p91
aa(lp92
VNow you also continue to watch
p93
aVas consciousness evolved to the point
p94
aVthat here in India, in Madhya Pradesh,
p95
aVthere's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found.
p96
aVIt's a cupule that took 40 to 50,000 blows with a stone tool to create,
p97
aVand it's the first known expression of art
p98
aVon the planet.
p99
aVAnd the reason it connects us with consciousness today
p100
aVis that all of us still today,
p101
aVthe very first shape we draw as a child
p102
aVis a circle.
p103
aVAnd then the next thing we do is we put a dot in the center of the circle.
p104
aVWe create an eye \u2014
p105
aVand the eye that evolves through all of our history.
p106
aVThere's the Egyptian god Horus,
p107
aVwhich symbolizes prosperity, wisdom and health.
p108
aVAnd that comes down right way to the present
p109
aVwith the dollar bill in the United States,
p110
aVwhich has on it an eye of providence.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo watching all of this show from outer space,
p113
aVyou think we get it, we understand
p114
aVthat the most precious resource on the blue planet
p115
aVis our consciousness.
p116
aVBecause it's the first thing we draw;
p117
aVwe surround ourselves with images of it;
p118
aVit's probably the most common image on the planet.
p119
aVBut we don't. We take our consciousness for granted.
p120
aVWhile I was producing in Los Angeles, I never thought about it for a second.
p121
aVUntil it was stripped from me, I never thought about it.
p122
aVAnd what I've learned since that event
p123
aVand during my recovery
p124
aVis that consciousness is under threat on this planet
p125
aVin ways it's never been under threat before.
p126
aVThese are just some examples.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd the reason I'm so honored to be here
p129
aVto talk today in India
p130
aVis because India has the sad distinction
p131
aVof being the head injury capital of the world.
p132
aVThat statistic is so sad.
p133
aVThere is no more drastic and sudden gap created
p134
aVbetween potential and actual mind
p135
aVthan a severe head injury.
p136
aVEach one can entail up to a decade of rehabilitation,
p137
aVwhich means that India, unless something changes,
p138
aVis accumulating a need
p139
aVfor millennia of rehabilitation.
p140
aVWhat you find in the United States
p141
aVis an injury every 20 seconds \u2014 that's one and a half million every year \u2014
p142
aVstroke every 40 seconds,
p143
aVAlzheimer's disease, every 70 seconds somebody succumbs to that.
p144
aVAll of these represent gaps
p145
aVbetween potential mind and actual mind.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd here are some of the other categories, if you look at the whole planet.
p148
aVThe World Health Organization tells us
p149
aVthat depression is the number one disease on Earth
p150
aVin terms of years lived with disability.
p151
aVWe find that the number two source of disability
p152
aVis depression in the age group
p153
aVof 15 to 44.
p154
aVOur children are becoming depressed
p155
aVat an alarming rate.
p156
aVI discovered during my recovery
p157
aVthe third leading cause of death amongst teenagers
p158
aVis suicide.
p159
aVIf you look at some of these other items \u2014 concussions.
p160
aVHalf of E.R. admissions from adolescents
p161
aVare for concussions.
p162
aVIf I talk about migraine,
p163
aV40 percent of the population
p164
aVsuffer episodic headaches.
p165
aVFifteen percent suffer migraines
p166
aVthat wipe them out for days on end.
p167
aa(lp168
VAll of this is leading \u2014 computer addiction,
p169
aVjust to cover that: the most frequent thing we do
p170
aVis use digital devices.
p171
aVThe average teenager
p172
aVsends 3,300 texts every [month].
p173
aVWe're talking about a society that is retreating
p174
aVinto depression and disassociation
p175
aVwhen we are potentially confronting
p176
aVthe next great catastrophic climate shift.
p177
aVSo what you'd be wondering, watching the Human Show,
p178
aVis are we going to confront and address
p179
aVthe catastrophic climate shift that may be heading our way
p180
aVby growing our consciousness,
p181
aVor are we going to continue to retreat?
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd that then might lead you
p184
aVto watch an episode one day
p185
aVof Cedars-Sinai medical center
p186
aVand a consideration of the difference between potential mind and actual mind.
p187
aVThis is a dense array EEG MRI
p188
aVtracking 156 channels of information.
p189
aVIt's not my EEG at Cedars;
p190
aVit's your EEG tonight and last night.
p191
aVIt's the what our minds do every night
p192
aVto digest the day
p193
aVand to prepare to bridge from the potential mind when we're asleep
p194
aVto the actual mind when we awaken the following morning.
p195
aVThis is how I was when I returned from the hospital
p196
aVafter nearly four months.
p197
aVThe horseshoe shape you can see on my skull
p198
aVis where they operated and went inside my brain
p199
aVto do the surgeries they needed to do to rescue my life.
p200
aVBut if you look into the eye of consciousness, that single eye you can see,
p201
aVI'm looking down,
p202
aVbut let me tell you how I felt at that point.
p203
aVI didn't feel empty; I felt everything simultaneously.
p204
aVI felt empty and full, hot and cold,
p205
aVeuphoric and depressed
p206
aVbecause the brain is the world's first
p207
aVfully functional quantum computer;
p208
aVit can occupy multiple states at the same time.
p209
aVAnd with all the internal regulators of my brain damaged,
p210
aVI felt everything simultaneously.
p211
aa(lp212
VBut let's swivel around and look at me frontally.
p213
aVThis is now flash-forward to the point in time
p214
aVwhere I've been discharged by the health system.
p215
aVLook into those eyes. I'm not able to focus those eyes.
p216
aVI'm not able to follow a line of text in a book.
p217
aVBut the system has moved me on
p218
aVbecause, as my family started to discover,
p219
aVthere is no long-term concept
p220
aVin the health care system.
p221
aVNeurological damage, 10 years of rehab,
p222
aVrequires a long-term perspective.
p223
aa(lp224
VBut let's take a look behind my eyes.
p225
aVThis is a gamma radiation spec scan
p226
aVthat uses gamma radiation
p227
aVto map three-dimensional function within the brain.
p228
aVIt requires a laboratory to see it in three dimension,
p229
aVbut in two dimensions I think you can see
p230
aVthe beautiful symmetry and illumination
p231
aVof a normal mind at work.
p232
aVHere's my brain.
p233
aVThat is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain
p234
aVbeing destroyed by the stroke.
p235
aVSo my family, as we moved forward
p236
aVand discovered that the health care system had moved us by,
p237
aVhad to try to find solutions and answers.
p238
aVAnd during that process \u2014 it took many years \u2014
p239
aVone of the doctors said that my recovery, my degree of advance,
p240
aVsince the amount of head injury I'd suffered,
p241
aVwas miraculous.
p242
aVAnd that was when I started to write a book,
p243
aVbecause I didn't think it was miraculous.
p244
aVI thought there were miraculous elements,
p245
aVbut I also didn't think it was right
p246
aVthat one should have to struggle and search for answers
p247
aVwhen this is a pandemic within our society.
p248
aa(lp249
VSo from this experience of my recovery,
p250
aVI want to share four particular aspects \u2014
p251
aVI call them the four C's of consciousness \u2014
p252
aVthat helped me grow my potential mind
p253
aVback towards the actual mind that I work with every day.
p254
aVThe first C is cognitive training.
p255
aVUnlike the smashed glass of my car,
p256
aVplasticity of the brain
p257
aVmeans that there was always a possibility, with treatment,
p258
aVto train the brain
p259
aVso that you can regain and raise your level of awareness and consciousness.
p260
aVPlasticity means that there was always
p261
aVhope for our reason \u2014
p262
aVhope for our ability to rebuild that function.
p263
aVIndeed, the mind can redefine itself,
p264
aVand this is demonstrated by two specialists called Hagen and Silva
p265
aVback in the 1970's.
p266
aVThe global perspective
p267
aVis that up to 30 percent of children in school
p268
aVhave learning weaknesses
p269
aVthat are not self-correcting,
p270
aVbut with appropriate treatment,
p271
aVthey can be screened for and detected and corrected
p272
aVand avoid their academic failure.
p273
aVBut what I discovered is it's almost impossible to find anyone
p274
aVwho provides that treatment or care.
p275
aa(lp276
VHere's what my neuropsychologist provided for me
p277
aVwhen I actually found somebody who could apply it.
p278
aVI'm not a doctor, so I'm not going to talk about the various subtests.
p279
aVLet's just talk about full-scale I.Q.
p280
aVFull-scale I.Q. is the mental processing \u2014
p281
aVhow fast you can acquire information,
p282
aVretain it and retrieve it \u2014
p283
aVthat is essential for success in life today.
p284
aVAnd you can see here there are three columns.
p285
aVUntestable \u2014 that's when I'm in my coma.
p286
aVAnd then I creep up to the point that I get a score of 79,
p287
aVwhich is just below average.
p288
aVIn the health care system, if you touch average, you're done.
p289
aVThat's when I was discharged from the system.
p290
aVWhat does average I.Q. really mean?
p291
aVIt meant that when I was given two and a half hours
p292
aVto take a test that anyone here
p293
aVwould take in 50 minutes,
p294
aVI might score an F.
p295
aVThis is a very, very low level
p296
aVin order to be kicked out of the health care system.
p297
aVThen I underwent cognitive training.
p298
aVAnd let me show you what happened to the right-hand column
p299
aVwhen I did my cognitive training over a period of time.
p300
aVThis is not supposed to occur.
p301
aVI.Q. is supposed to stabilize and solidify
p302
aVat the age of eight.
p303
aa(lp304
VNow the Journal of the National Medical Association
p305
aVgave my memoir a full clinical review,
p306
aVwhich is very unusual.
p307
aVI'm not a doctor. I have no medical background whatsoever.
p308
aVBut they felt the evidences
p309
aVthat there was important, valuable information in the book,
p310
aVand they commented about it when they gave the full peer review to it.
p311
aVBut they asked one question. They said, "Is this repeatable?"
p312
aVThat was a fair question
p313
aVbecause my memoir was simply how I found solutions that worked for me.
p314
aa(lp315
VThe answer is yes, and for the first time,
p316
aVit's my pleasure to be able to share two examples.
p317
aVHere's somebody, what they did as they went through cognitive training
p318
aVat ages seven and 11.
p319
aVAnd here's another person in, call it, high school and college.
p320
aVAnd this person is particularly interesting.
p321
aVI won't go into the intrascatter that's in the subtests,
p322
aVbut they still had a neurologic issue.
p323
aVBut that person could be identified
p324
aVas having a learning disability.
p325
aVAnd with accommodation, they went on to college
p326
aVand had a full life in terms of their opportunities.
p327
aa(lp328
VSecond aspect:
p329
aVI still had crushing migraine headaches.
p330
aVTwo elements that worked for me here
p331
aVare \u2014 the first is 90 percent, I learned, of head and neck pain
p332
aVis through muscular-skeletal imbalance.
p333
aVThe craniomandibular system is critical to that.
p334
aVAnd when I underwent it and found solutions,
p335
aVthis is the interrelationship between the TMJ and the teeth.
p336
aVUp to 30 percent of the population
p337
aVhave a disorder, disease or dysfunction in the jaw
p338
aVthat affects the entire body.
p339
aVI was fortunate to find a dentist
p340
aVwho applied this entire universe
p341
aVof technology you're about to see
p342
aVto establish that if he repositioned my jaw,
p343
aVthe headaches pretty much resolved,
p344
aVbut that then my teeth weren't in the right place.
p345
aVHe then held my jaw in the right position
p346
aVwhile orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment.
p347
aVSo my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position.
p348
aVThis affected my entire body.
p349
aa(lp350
VIf that sounds like a very, very strange thing to say
p351
aVand rather a bold statement \u2014
p352
aVHow can the jaw affect the entire body? \u2014
p353
aVlet me simply point out to you,
p354
aVif I ask you tomorrow
p355
aVto put one grain of sand between your teeth
p356
aVand go for a nice long walk,
p357
aVhow far would you last
p358
aVbefore you had to remove that grain of sand?
p359
aVThat tiny misalignment.
p360
aVBear in mind, there are no nerves in the teeth.
p361
aVThat's why the same between the before and after that this shows,
p362
aVit's hard to see the difference.
p363
aVNow just trying putting a few grains of sand between your teeth
p364
aVand see the difference it makes.
p365
aVI still had migraine headaches.
p366
aa(lp367
VThe next issue that resolved
p368
aVwas that, if 90 percent of head and neck pain
p369
aVis caused by imbalance,
p370
aVthe other 10 percent, largely \u2014
p371
aVif you set aside aneurysms, brain cancer
p372
aVand hormonal issues \u2014
p373
aVis the circulation.
p374
aVImagine the blood flowing through your body \u2014
p375
aVI was told at UCLA Medical Center \u2014
p376
aVas one sealed system.
p377
aVThere's a big pipe with the blood flowing through it,
p378
aVand around that pipe are the nerves
p379
aVdrawing their nutrient supply from the blood.
p380
aVThat's basically it.
p381
aVIf you press on a hose pipe in a sealed system,
p382
aVit bulges someplace else.
p383
aVIf that some place else where it bulges
p384
aVis inside the biggest nerve in your body, your brain,
p385
aVyou get a vascular migraine.
p386
aVThis is a level of pain that's only known
p387
aVto other people who suffer vascular migraines.
p388
aVUsing this technology,
p389
aVthis is mapping in three dimensions.
p390
aVThis is an MRI MRA MRV,
p391
aVa volumetric MRI.
p392
aVUsing this technology, the specialists at UCLA Medical Center
p393
aVwere able to identify
p394
aVwhere that compression in the hose pipe was occurring.
p395
aVA vascular surgeon removed most of the first rib on both sides of my body.
p396
aVAnd in the following months and years,
p397
aVI felt the neurological flow of life itself returning.
p398
aa(lp399
VCommunication, the next C. This is critical.
p400
aVAll consciousness is about communication.
p401
aVAnd here, by great fortune,
p402
aVone of my father's clients
p403
aVhad a husband who worked
p404
aVat the Alfred Mann Foundation for Scientific Research.
p405
aVAlfred Mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator
p406
aVwho's fascinated with bridging gaps in consciousness,
p407
aVwhether to restore hearing to the deaf, vision to the blind
p408
aVor movement to the paralyzed.
p409
aVAnd I'm just going to give you an example today
p410
aVof movement to the paralyzed.
p411
aVI've brought with me, from Southern California,
p412
aVthe FM device.
p413
aVThis is it being held in the hand.
p414
aVIt weighs less than a gram.
p415
aVSo two of them implanted in the body would weigh less than a dime.
p416
aVFive of them would still weigh less
p417
aVthan a rupee coin.
p418
aa(lp419
VWhere does it go inside the body?
p420
aVIt has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion-free
p421
aVfor over 80 years.
p422
aVSo it goes in and it stays there.
p423
aVHere are the implantation sites.
p424
aVThe concept that they're working towards \u2014 and they have working prototypes \u2014
p425
aVis that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body
p426
aVwhere they're needed.
p427
aVThe main unit will then go inside the brain.
p428
aVAn FM device in the cortex of the brain, the motor cortex,
p429
aVwill send signals in real time
p430
aVto the motor points in the relevant muscles
p431
aVso that the person will be able to move their arm, let's say, in real time,
p432
aVif they've lost control of their arm.
p433
aVAnd other FM devices implanted in fingertips,
p434
aVon contacting a surface,
p435
aVwill send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain,
p436
aVso that the person feels a sense of touch.
p437
aVIs this science fiction? No,
p438
aVbecause I'm wearing the first application of this technology.
p439
aVI don't have the ability to control my left foot.
p440
aVA radio device is controlling every step I take,
p441
aVand a sensor picks up my foot for me
p442
aVevery time I walk.
p443
aa(lp444
VAnd in closing, I want to share
p445
aVthe personal reason why this meant so much to me
p446
aVand changed the direction of my life.
p447
aVIn my coma, one of the presences I sensed
p448
aVwas someone I felt was a protector.
p449
aVAnd when I came out of my coma, I recognized my family,
p450
aVbut I didn't remember my own past.
p451
aVGradually, I remembered the protector was my wife.
p452
aVAnd I whispered the good news
p453
aVthrough my broken jaw, which was wired shut,
p454
aVto my night nurse.
p455
aVAnd the following morning, my mother came to explain
p456
aVthat I'd not always been in this bed, in this room,
p457
aVthat I'd been working in film and television
p458
aVand that I had been in a crash
p459
aVand that, yes, I was married,
p460
aVbut Marcy had been killed instantly in the crash.
p461
aVAnd during my time in coma,
p462
aVshe had been laid to rest in her hometown of Phoenix.
p463
aVNow in the dark years that followed, I had to work out what remained for me
p464
aVif everything that made today special was gone.
p465
aVAnd as I discovered these threats to consciousness
p466
aVand how they are surrounding the world
p467
aVand enveloping the lives of more and more people every day,
p468
aVI discovered what truly remained.
p469
aVI believe that we can overcome the threats to our consciousness,
p470
aVthat the Human Show can stay on the air
p471
aVfor millennia to come.
p472
aVI believe that we can all rise and shine.

VYou know,
p483
aVwhen I heard Simon's \u2014
p484
aVplease sit down; I just want to talk to him for a second \u2014
p485
aVwhen I read his book, I went to LA to meet him.
p486
aVAnd so I was sitting in this restaurant,
p487
aVwaiting for a man to come by
p488
aVwho obviously would have some difficulty ...
p489
aVI don't know what I had in my mind.
p490
aVAnd he was walking around.
p491
aVI didn't expect that person that I was going to meet
p492
aVto be him.
p493
aVAnd then we met and we talked,
p494
aVand I'm like, he doesn't look
p495
aVlike somebody who was built out of nothing.
p496
aVAnd then I was amazed
p497
aVat what role technology played
p498
aVin your recovery.
p499
aVAnd we have his book outside
p500
aVin the bookshop.
p501
aVThe thing that amazed me
p502
aVis the painstaking detail
p503
aVwith which he has written
p504
aVevery hospital he has been to,
p505
aVevery treatment he got,
p506
aVevery near-miss he had,
p507
aVand how accidentally he stumbled upon innovations.
p508
aVSo I think this one detail
p509
aVwent past people really quick.
p510
aVTell a little bit about what you're wearing on your leg.
p511
aa(lp512
VSimon Lewis: I knew when I was timing this
p513
aVthat there wouldn't be time for me to do anything about \u2014
p514
aVWell this is it. This is the control unit.
p515
aVAnd this records every single step I've taken
p516
aVfor, ooh, five or six years now.
p517
aVAnd if I do this, probably the mic won't hear it.
p518
aVThat little chirp followed by two chirps is now switched on.
p519
aVWhen I press it again, it'll chirp three times,
p520
aVand that'll mean that it's armed and ready to go.
p521
aVAnd that's my friend. I mean, I charge it every night.
p522
aVAnd it works. It works.
p523
aVAnd what I would love to add because I didn't have time ...
p524
aa(lp525
VWhat does it do? Well actually, I'll show you down here.
p526
aVThis down here, if the camera can see that,
p527
aVthat is a small antenna.
p528
aVUnderneath my heel, there is a sensor
p529
aVthat detects when my foot leaves the ground \u2014
p530
aVwhat's called the heel lift.
p531
aVThis thing blinks all the time; I'll leave it out, so you might be able to see it.
p532
aVBut this is blinking all the time. It's sending signals in real time.
p533
aVAnd if you walk faster, if I walk faster,
p534
aVit detects what's called the time interval,
p535
aVwhich is the interval between each heel lift.
p536
aVAnd it accelerates the amount and level of the stimulation.
p537
aVThe other things they've worked on \u2014 I didn't have time to say this in my talk \u2014
p538
aVis they've restored functional hearing
p539
aVto thousands of deaf people.
p540
aa(lp541
VI could tell you the story: this was going to be an abandoned technology,
p542
aVbut Alfred Mann met the doctor who was going to retire,
p543
aV[Dr. Schindler.]
p544
aVAnd he was going to retire \u2014 all the technology was going to be lost,
p545
aVbecause not a single medical manufacturer would take it on
p546
aVbecause it was a small issue.
p547
aVBut there's millions of deaf people in the world,
p548
aVand the Cochlear implant has given hearing to thousands of deaf people now.
p549
aVIt works.
p550
aVAnd the other thing is they're working on artificial retinas for the blind.
p551
aVAnd this, this is the implantable generation.
p552
aVBecause what I didn't say in my talk
p553
aVis this is actually exoskeletal.
p554
aVI should clarify that.
p555
aVBecause the first generation is exoskeletal,
p556
aVit's wrapped around the leg,
p557
aVaround the affected limb.
p558
aVI must tell you, they're an amazing \u2014
p559
aVthere's a hundred people who work in that building \u2014
p560
aVengineers, scientists,
p561
aVand other team members \u2014 all the time.
p562
aa(lp563
VAlfred Mann has set up this foundation
p564
aVto advance this research
p565
aVbecause he saw
p566
aVthere's no way venture capital would come in for something like this.
p567
aVThe audience is too small.
p568
aVYou'd think, there's plenty of paralyzed people in the world,
p569
aVbut the audience is too small,
p570
aVand the amount of research, the time it takes,
p571
aVthe FDA clearances,
p572
aVthe payback time is too long
p573
aVfor V.C. to be interested.
p574
aVSo he saw a need and he stepped in.
p575
aVHe's a very, very remarkable man.
p576
aVHe's done a lot of very cutting-edge science.
p577
aa(lp578
VLP: So when you get a chance, spend some time with Simon.
