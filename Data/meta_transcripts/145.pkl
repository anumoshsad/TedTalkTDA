VI study ants, and that's because I like to think about how organizations work.
p4
aVAnd in particular, how the simple parts of organizations
p5
aVinteract to create the behavior of the whole organization.
p6
aVSo, ant colonies are a good example of an organization like that,
p7
aVand there are many others. The web is one.
p8
aVThere are many biological systems like that \u2014
p9
aVbrains, cells, developing embryos.
p10
aa(lp11
VThere are about 10,000 species of ants.
p12
aVThey all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens,
p13
aVand then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers.
p14
aVAnd all ant colonies have in common that there's no central control.
p15
aVNobody tells anybody what to do.
p16
aVThe queen just lays the eggs. There's no management.
p17
aVNo ant directs the behavior of any other ant.
p18
aVAnd I try to figure out how that works.
p19
aVAnd I've been working for the past 20 years
p20
aVon a population of seed-eating ants in southeastern Arizona.
p21
aa(lp22
VHere's my study site. This is really a picture of ants,
p23
aVand the rabbit just happens to be there.
p24
aVAnd these ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds.
p25
aVThis is the nest of the mature colony, and there's the nest entrance.
p26
aVAnd they forage maybe for about 20 meters away,
p27
aVgather up the seeds and bring them back to the nest, and store them.
p28
aVAnd every year I go there and make a map of my study site.
p29
aVThis is just a road. And it's not very big:
p30
aVit's about 250 meters on one side, 400 on the other.
p31
aVAnd every colony has a name, which is a number,
p32
aVwhich is painted on a rock. And I go there every year
p33
aVand look for all the colonies that were alive the year before,
p34
aVand figure out which ones have died, and put all the new ones on the map.
p35
aVAnd by doing this I know how old they all are.
p36
aVAnd because of that, I've been able to study how their behavior changes
p37
aVas the colony gets older and larger.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo I want to tell you about the life cycle of a colony.
p40
aVAnts never make more ants; colonies make more colonies.
p41
aVAnd they do that by each year sending out the reproductives \u2014
p42
aVthose are the ones with wings \u2014 on a mating flight.
p43
aVSo every year, on the same day \u2014 and it's a mystery exactly how that happens \u2014
p44
aVeach colony sends out its virgin, unmated queens with wings, and the males,
p45
aVand they all fly to a common place. And they mate.
p46
aVAnd this shows a recently virgin queen. Here's her wings.
p47
aVAnd she's in the process of mating with this male,
p48
aVand there's another male on top waiting his turn.
p49
aVOften the queens mate more than once.
p50
aVAnd after that, the males all die. That's it for them.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd then the newly mated queens fly off somewhere, drop their wings,
p55
aVdig a hole and go into that hole and start laying eggs.
p56
aVAnd they will live for 15 or 20 years, continuing to lay eggs
p57
aVusing the sperm from that original mating.
p58
aVSo the queen goes down in there.
p59
aVShe lays eggs, she feeds the larvae \u2014 so an ant starts as an egg, then it's a larva.
p60
aVShe feeds the larvae by regurgitating from her fat reserves.
p61
aVThen, as soon as the ants \u2014 the first group of ants \u2014 emerge,
p62
aVthey're larvae. Then they're pupae. Then they come out as adult ants.
p63
aVThey go out, they get the food, they dig the nest,
p64
aVand the queen never comes out again.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo this is a one-year-old colony \u2014 this happens to be 536.
p67
aVThere's the nest entrance, there's a pencil for scale.
p68
aVSo this is the colony founded by a queen the previous summer.
p69
aVThis is a three-year-old colony.
p70
aVThere's the nest entrance, there's a pencil for scale.
p71
aVThey make a midden, a pile of refuse \u2014 mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat.
p72
aVThis is a five-year-old colony. This is the nest entrance, here's a pencil for scale.
p73
aVThis is about as big as they get, about a meter across.
p74
aVAnd then this is how colony size and numbers of worker ants changes \u2014
p75
aVso this is about 10,000 worker ants \u2014
p76
aVchanges as a function of colony age, in years.
p77
aVSo it starts out with zero ants, just the founding queen,
p78
aVand it grows to a size of about 10 or 12 thousand ants when the colony is five.
p79
aVAnd it stays that size until the queen dies
p80
aVand there's nobody to make more ants, when she's about 15 or 20 years old.
p81
aVAnd it's when they reach this stable size, in numbers of ants,
p82
aVthat they start to reproduce.
p83
aVThat is, to send more winged queens and males to that year's mating flight.
p84
aVAnd I know how colony size changes as a function of colony age
p85
aVbecause I've dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants. (Laughter)
p86
aVSo that's not the most fun part of this research, although it's interesting.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VReally the question that I think about with these ants is what I call task allocation.
p91
aVThat's not just how is the colony organized,
p92
aVbut how does it change what it's doing?
p93
aVHow is it that the colony manages to adjust
p94
aVthe numbers of workers performing each task as conditions change?
p95
aVSo, things happen to an ant colony.
p96
aVWhen it rains in the summer, it floods in the desert.
p97
aVThere's a lot of damage to the nest,
p98
aVand extra ants are needed to clean up that mess.
p99
aVWhen extra food becomes available \u2014
p100
aVand this is what everybody knows about picnics \u2014
p101
aVthen extra ants are allocated to collect the food.
p102
aVSo, with nobody telling anybody what to do, how is it that
p103
aVthe colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task?
p104
aVAnd that's the process that I call task allocation.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd in harvester ants, I divide the tasks
p107
aVof the ants I see just outside the nest
p108
aVinto these four categories: where an ant is foraging,
p109
aVwhen it's out along the foraging trail, searching for food or bringing food back.
p110
aVThe patrollers \u2014 that's supposed to be a magnifying glass \u2014
p111
aVare an interesting group that go out early in the morning
p112
aVbefore the foragers are active.
p113
aVThey somehow choose the direction that the foragers will go,
p114
aVand by coming back \u2014 just by making it back \u2014
p115
aVthey tell the foragers that it's safe to go out.
p116
aVThen the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest,
p117
aVand I wanted to say that the nests look a lot like Bill Lishman's house.
p118
aVThat is, that there are chambers inside,
p119
aVthey line the walls of the chambers with moist soil
p120
aVand it dries to a kind of an adobe-like surface in it.
p121
aVIt also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings
p122
aVof the Hopi people that are in that area.
p123
aVAnd the nest maintenance workers do that inside the nest,
p124
aVand then they come out of the nest carrying bits of dry soil in their mandibles.
p125
aVSo you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand,
p126
aVput it down, turn around, and go back in.
p127
aVAnd finally, the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage.
p128
aVSo what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse.
p129
aVOn one day, it'll all be here, and then the next day
p130
aVthey'll move it over there, and then they'll move it back.
p131
aVSo that's what the midden workers do.
p132
aVAnd these four groups are just the ants outside the nest.
p133
aVSo that's only about 25 percent of the colony, and they're the oldest ants.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo, an ant starts out somewhere near the queen.
p136
aVAnd when we dig up nests we find they're about as deep
p137
aVas the colony is wide, so about a meter deep for the big old nests.
p138
aVAnd then there's another long tunnel and a chamber, where we often find the queen,
p139
aVafter eight hours of hacking away at the rock with pickaxes.
p140
aVI don't think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe
p141
aVand my crew of students with pickaxes,
p142
aVbut instead because when there's flooding,
p143
aVoccasionally the colony has to go down deep.
p144
aVSo there's this whole network of chambers.
p145
aVThe queen's in there somewhere; she just lays eggs.
p146
aVThere's the larvae, and they consume most of the food.
p147
aVAnd this is true of most ants \u2014
p148
aVthat the ants you see walking around don't do much eating.
p149
aVThey bring it back and feed it to the larvae.
p150
aVWhen the foragers come in with food, they just drop it into the upper chamber,
p151
aVand other ants come up from below, get the food,
p152
aVbring it back, husk the seeds, and pile them up.
p153
aVThere are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest.
p154
aVAnd curiously, and interestingly, it looks as though at any time
p155
aVabout half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing.
p156
aVSo, despite what it says in the Bible,
p157
aVabout, you know, "Look to the ant, thou sluggard,"
p158
aVin fact, you could think of those ants as reserves.
p159
aVThat is to say, if something happened \u2014 and I've never seen anything like this happen,
p160
aVbut I've only been looking for 20 years \u2014
p161
aVif something happened, they might all come out if they were needed.
p162
aVBut in fact, mostly they're just hanging around in there.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd I think it's a very interesting question \u2014
p165
aVwhat is there about the way the colony is organized
p166
aVthat might give some function to a reserve of ants who are doing nothing?
p167
aVAnd they sort of stand as a buffer in between
p168
aVthe ants working deep inside the nest and the ants working outside.
p169
aVAnd if you mark ants that are working outside, and dig up a colony,
p170
aVyou never see them deep down.
p171
aVSo what's happening is that the ants work inside the nest when they're younger.
p172
aVThey somehow get into this reserve.
p173
aVAnd then eventually they get recruited to join this exterior workforce.
p174
aVAnd once they belong to the ants that work outside, they never go back down.
p175
aVNow ants \u2014 most ants, including these, don't see very well.
p176
aVThey have eyes, they can distinguish between light and dark,
p177
aVbut they mostly work by smell.
p178
aVSo just to reinforce that what you might have thought
p179
aVabout ant queens isn't true \u2014
p180
aVyou know, even if the queen did have the intelligence
p181
aVto send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers
p182
aVto tell the ants outside what to do,
p183
aVthere is no way that such messages could make it in time to see
p184
aVthe shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest.
p185
aVSo that's one way that we know the queen isn't directing the behavior of the colony.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo when I first set out to work on task allocation,
p188
aVmy first question was, "What's the relationship
p189
aVbetween the ants doing different tasks?
p190
aVDoes it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing?
p191
aVDoes it matter to the midden workers what the patrollers are doing?"
p192
aVAnd I was working in the context of a view of ant colonies in which each ant
p193
aVwas somehow dedicated to its task from birth
p194
aVand sort of performed independently of the others,
p195
aVknowing its place on the assembly line.
p196
aVAnd instead I wanted to ask, "How are the different task groups interdependent?"
p197
aa(lp198
VSo I did experiments where I changed one thing.
p199
aVSo for example, I created more work for the nest maintenance workers
p200
aVby putting out a pile of toothpicks near the nest entrance,
p201
aVearly in the morning when the nest maintenance workers are first active.
p202
aVThis is what it looks like about 20 minutes later.
p203
aVHere it is about 40 minutes later.
p204
aVAnd the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks
p205
aVto the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there.
p206
aVAnd what I wanted to know was, "OK,
p207
aVhere's a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited \u2014
p208
aVis this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks?"
p209
aVThen we repeated all those experiments with the ants marked.
p210
aVSo here's some blue nest maintenance workers.
p211
aVAnd lately we've gotten more sophisticated
p212
aVand we have this three-color system.
p213
aVAnd we can mark them individually so we know which ant is which.
p214
aVWe started out with model airplane paint
p215
aVand then we found these wonderful little Japanese markers,
p216
aVand they work really well.
p217
aVAnd so just to summarize the result,
p218
aVwell it turns out that yes, the different tasks are interdependent.
p219
aVSo, if I change the numbers performing one task,
p220
aVit changes the numbers performing another.
p221
aVSo for example, if I make a mess
p222
aVthat the nest maintenance workers have to clean up,
p223
aVthen I see fewer ants out foraging.
p224
aVAnd this was true for all the pair-wise combinations of tasks.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnd the second result, which was surprising to a lot of people,
p227
aVwas that ants actually switch tasks.
p228
aVThe same ant doesn't do the same task over and over its whole life.
p229
aVSo for example, if I put out extra food, everybody else \u2014
p230
aVthe midden workers stop doing midden work and go get the food,
p231
aVthey become foragers.
p232
aVThe nest maintenance workers become foragers.
p233
aVThe patrollers become foragers.
p234
aVBut not every transition is possible. And this shows how it works.
p235
aVLike I just said, if there is more food to collect, the patrollers, the midden workers,
p236
aVthe nest maintenance workers will all change to forage.
p237
aVIf there's more patrolling to do \u2014
p238
aVso I created a disturbance, so extra patrollers were needed \u2014
p239
aVthe nest maintenance workers will switch to patrol.
p240
aVBut if more nest maintenance work is needed \u2014
p241
aVfor example, if I put out a bunch of toothpicks \u2014
p242
aVthen nobody will ever switch back to nest maintenance,
p243
aVthey have to get nest maintenance workers from inside the nest.
p244
aVSo foraging acts as a sink, and the ants inside the nest act as a source.
p245
aVAnd finally, it looks like each ant is deciding
p246
aVmoment to moment whether to be active or not.
p247
aa(lp248
VSo, for example, when there's extra nest maintenance work to do,
p249
aVit's not that the foragers switch over. I know that they don't do that.
p250
aVBut the foragers somehow decide not to come out.
p251
aVAnd here was the most intriguing result: the task allocation.
p252
aVThis process changes with colony age, and it changes like this.
p253
aVWhen I do these experiments with older colonies \u2014
p254
aVso ones that are five years or older \u2014
p255
aVthey're much more consistent from one time to another
p256
aVand much more homeostatic. The worse things get,
p257
aVthe more I hassle them, the more they act like undisturbed colonies.
p258
aVWhereas the young, small colonies \u2014
p259
aVthe two-year-old colonies of just 2,000 ants \u2014 are much more variable.
p260
aVAnd the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year.
p261
aVIt could be this year, or this year.
p262
aVSo, the ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable
p263
aVare not any older than the ants in the younger colony.
p264
aVIt's not due to the experience of older, wiser ants.
p265
aVInstead, something about the organization
p266
aVmust be changing as the colony gets older.
p267
aVAnd the obvious thing that's changing is its size.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo since I've had this result, I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out
p270
aVwhat kinds of decision rules \u2014 very simple, local, probably olfactory, chemical
p271
aVrules could an ant could be using, since no ant can assess the global situation \u2014
p272
aVthat would have the outcome that I see,
p273
aVthese predictable dynamics, in who does what task.
p274
aVAnd it would change as the colony gets larger.
p275
aVAnd what I've found out is that ants are using a network of antennal contact.
p276
aVSo anybody who's ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae.
p277
aVThey smell with their antennae.
p278
aVWhen one ant touches another, it's smelling it,
p279
aVand it can tell, for example, whether the other ant is a nest mate
p280
aVbecause ants cover themselves and each other, through grooming,
p281
aVwith a layer of grease, which carries a colony-specific odor.
p282
aVAnd what we're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts,
p283
aVthe rate at which it meets ants of other tasks, in deciding what to do.
p284
aVAnd so what the message is, is not any message
p285
aVthat they transmit from one ant to another, but the pattern.
p286
aVThe pattern itself is the message.
p287
aVAnd I'll tell you a little bit more about that.
p288
aa(lp289
VBut first you might be wondering:
p290
aVhow is it that an ant can tell, for example, I'm a forager.
p291
aVI expect to meet another forager every so often.
p292
aVBut if instead I start to meet a higher number of nest maintenance workers,
p293
aVI'm less likely to forage.
p294
aVSo it has to know the difference between
p295
aVa forager and a nest maintenance worker.
p296
aVAnd we've learned that, in this species \u2014
p297
aVand I suspect in others as well \u2014
p298
aVthese hydrocarbons, this layer of grease on the outside of ants,
p299
aVis different as ants perform different tasks.
p300
aVAnd we've done experiments that show that
p301
aVthat's because the longer an ant stays outside,
p302
aVthe more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface change,
p303
aVand so they come to smell different by doing different tasks.
p304
aVAnd they can use that task-specific odor in cuticular hydrocarbons \u2014
p305
aVthey can use that in their brief antennal contacts to somehow
p306
aVkeep track of the rate at which they're meeting ants of certain tasks.
p307
aVAnd we've just recently demonstrated this
p308
aVby putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads,
p309
aVand dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate.
p310
aVAnd it turns out that ants will respond to the right rate of contact
p311
aVwith a glass bead with hydrocarbon extract on it,
p312
aVas they would to contact with real ants.
p313
aa(lp314
VSo I want now to show you a bit of film \u2014
p315
aVand this will start out, first of all, showing you the nest entrance.
p316
aVSo the idea is that ants are coming in and out of the nest entrance.
p317
aVThey've gone out to do different tasks, and the rate at which they meet
p318
aVas they come in and out of the nest entrance determines, or influences,
p319
aVeach ant's decision about whether to go out, and which task to perform.
p320
aVThis is taken through a fiber optics microscope. It's down inside the nest.
p321
aVIn the beginning you see the ants
p322
aVjust kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope.
p323
aVBut the idea is that the ants are in there,
p324
aVand each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants past it \u2014
p325
aVa stream of contacts with other ants.
p326
aVAnd the pattern of these interactions determines
p327
aVwhether the ant comes back out, and what it does when it comes back out.
p328
aVYou can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these.
p329
aVEach ant, then, as it comes back in, is contacting other ants.
p330
aVAnd the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance
p331
aVto decide whether to go out on their next trip,
p332
aVare contacting the ants coming in.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo, what's interesting about this system is that it's messy.
p335
aVIt's variable. It's noisy. And, in particular, in two ways.
p336
aVThe first is that the experience of the ant \u2014 of each ant \u2014 can't be very predictable.
p337
aVBecause the rate at which ants come back depends on
p338
aVall the little things that happen to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside.
p339
aVAnd the second thing is that an ant's ability to assess this pattern
p340
aVmust be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting.
p341
aVSo, we do a lot of simulation and modeling, and also experimental work,
p342
aVto try to figure out how those two kinds of noise combine to,
p343
aVin the aggregate, produce the predictable behavior of ant colonies.
p344
aa(lp345
VAgain, I don't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions
p346
aVproduces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork.
p347
aVIn fact, if you watch ants at all, you end up trying to help them
p348
aVbecause they never seem to be doing anything
p349
aVexactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing it.
p350
aVSo it's not really that out of these haphazard contacts, perfection arises.
p351
aVBut it works pretty well.
p352
aVAnts have been around for several hundred million years.
p353
aVThey cover the earth, except for Antarctica.
p354
aVSomething that they're doing is clearly successful enough
p355
aVthat this pattern of haphazard contacts, in the aggregate,
p356
aVproduces something that allows ants to make a lot more ants.
p357
aVAnd one of the things that we're studying is how natural selection
p358
aVmight be acting now to shape this use of interaction patterns \u2014
p359
aVthis network of interaction patterns \u2014
p360
aVto perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies.
p361
aa(lp362
VSo the one thing, though, that I want you to remember about this
p363
aVis that these patterns of interactions
p364
aVare something that you'd expect to be closely connected to colony size.
p365
aVThe simplest idea is that when an ant is in a small colony \u2014
p366
aVand an ant in a large colony can use the same rule,
p367
aVlike "I expect to meet another forager every three seconds."
p368
aVBut in a small colony, it's likely to meet fewer foragers,
p369
aVjust because there are fewer other foragers there to meet.
p370
aVSo this is the kind of rule that, as the colony develops and gets older and larger,
p371
aVwill produce different behavior in an old colony and a small young one.
