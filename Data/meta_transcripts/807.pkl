VYou know for me, the interest in contemporary forms of slavery
p4
aVstarted with a leaflet that I picked up in London.
p5
aVIt was the early '90s,
p6
aVand I was at a public event.
p7
aVI saw this leaflet and it said,
p8
aV"There are millions of slaves in the world today."
p9
aVAnd I thought, "No way, no way."
p10
aVAnd I'm going to admit to hubris.
p11
aVBecause I also, I'm going to admit to you,
p12
aVI also thought, "How can I be like
p13
aVa hot-shot young full professor
p14
aVwho teaches human rights and not know this?
p15
aVSo it can't be true."
p16
aa(lp17
VWell, if you teach, if you worship
p18
aVin the temple of learning,
p19
aVdo not mock the gods,
p20
aVbecause they will take you,
p21
aVfill you with curiosity and desire,
p22
aVand drive you. Drive you with a passion
p23
aVto change things.
p24
aVI went out and did a lit review,
p25
aV3,000 articles on the key word "slavery."
p26
aVTwo turned out to be about contemporary \u2014 only two.
p27
aVAll the rest were historical.
p28
aVThey were press pieces and they were full of outrage,
p29
aVthey were full of speculation, they were anecdotal \u2014
p30
aVno solid information.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo, I began to do a research project of my own.
p33
aVI went to five countries around the world.
p34
aVI looked at slaves. I met slaveholders,
p35
aVand I looked very deeply
p36
aVinto slave-based businesses
p37
aVbecause this is an economic crime.
p38
aVPeople do not enslave people to be mean to them.
p39
aVThey do it to make a profit.
p40
aVAnd I've got to tell you, what I found out in the world
p41
aVin four different continents,
p42
aVwas depressingly familiar.
p43
aVLike this:
p44
aVAgricultural workers in Africa,
p45
aVwhipped and beaten,
p46
aVshowing us how they were beaten in the fields
p47
aVbefore they escaped from slavery
p48
aVand met up with our film crew.
p49
aVIt was mind-blowing.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd I want to be very clear.
p52
aVI'm talking about real slavery.
p53
aVThis is not about lousy marriages,
p54
aVthis is not about jobs that suck.
p55
aVThis is about people who can not walk away,
p56
aVpeople who are forced to work without pay,
p57
aVpeople who are operating 24/7
p58
aVunder a threat of violence
p59
aVand have no pay.
p60
aVIt's real slavery in exactly the same way
p61
aVthat slavery would be recognized
p62
aVthroughout all of human history.
p63
aa(lp64
VNow, where is it?
p65
aVWell, this map in the sort of redder, yellower colors
p66
aVare the places with the highest densities of slavery.
p67
aVBut in fact that kind of bluey color
p68
aVare the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery.
p69
aVAnd you might notice that it's only Iceland and Greenland
p70
aVwhere we can't find any cases of enslavement
p71
aVaround the world.
p72
aa(lp73
VWe're also particularly interested
p74
aVand looking very carefully
p75
aVat places where
p76
aVslaves are being used to perpetrate
p77
aVextreme environmental destruction.
p78
aVAround the world, slaves are used to destroy the environment,
p79
aVcutting down trees in the Amazon; destroying
p80
aVforest areas in West Africa;
p81
aVmining and spreading mercury around
p82
aVin places like Ghana and the Congo;
p83
aVdestroying the coastal ecosystems in South Asia.
p84
aVIt's a pretty harrowing linkage
p85
aVbetween what's happening to our environment
p86
aVand what's happening to our human rights.
p87
aa(lp88
VNow, how on Earth did we get to a situation like this,
p89
aVwhere we have 27 million people
p90
aVin slavery in the year 2010?
p91
aVThat's double the number that came out of Africa
p92
aVin the entire transatlantic slave trade.
p93
aVWell, it builds up with these factors.
p94
aVThey are not causal, they are actually supporting factors.
p95
aVOne we all know about, the population explosion:
p96
aVthe world goes from two billion people to almost
p97
aVseven billion people in the last 50 years.
p98
aVBeing numerous does not make you a slave.
p99
aVAdd in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people
p100
aVin the developing world,
p101
aVcaused by civil wars, ethnic conflicts,
p102
aVkleptocratic governments, disease ... you name it, you know it.
p103
aa(lp104
VWe understand how that works. In some countries
p105
aVall of those things happen at once,
p106
aVlike Sierra Leone a few years ago,
p107
aVand push enormous parts ... about a billion people in the world, in fact,
p108
aVas we know, live on the edge,
p109
aVlive in situations where
p110
aVthey don't have any opportunity and are usually even destitute.
p111
aVBut that doesn't make you a slave either.
p112
aVWhat it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerable
p113
aVinto a slave, is the absence of the rule of law.
p114
aVIf the rule of law is sound, it protects
p115
aVthe poor and it protects the vulnerable.
p116
aVBut if corruption creeps in
p117
aVand people don't have the opportunity
p118
aVto have that protection of the rule of law,
p119
aVthen if you can use violence,
p120
aVif you can use violence with impunity,
p121
aVyou can reach out and harvest the vulnerable
p122
aVinto slavery.
p123
aa(lp124
VWell, that is precisely what has happened around the world.
p125
aVThough, for a lot of people,
p126
aVthe people who step
p127
aVinto slavery today
p128
aVdon't usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head.
p129
aVThey come into slavery because
p130
aVsomeone has asked them this question.
p131
aa(lp132
VAll around the world I've been told an almost identical story.
p133
aVPeople say, "I was home,
p134
aVsomeone came into our village,
p135
aVthey stood up in the back of a truck, they said, 'I've got jobs,
p136
aVwho needs a job?'"
p137
aVAnd they did exactly what
p138
aVyou or I would do in the same situation.
p139
aVThey said, "That guy looked sketchy. I was suspicious,
p140
aVbut my children were hungry.
p141
aVWe needed medicine.
p142
aVI knew I had to do anything I could
p143
aVto earn some money to support the people I care about."
p144
aVThey climb into the back of the truck. They go off with the person who recruits them.
p145
aVTen miles, 100 miles, 1,000 miles later,
p146
aVthey find themselves in dirty, dangerous, demeaning work.
p147
aVThey take it for a little while,
p148
aVbut when they try to leave, bang!, the hammer comes down,
p149
aVand they discover they're enslaved.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow, that kind of slavery
p152
aVis, again, pretty much what slavery has been all through human history.
p153
aVBut there is one thing that is particularly remarkable
p154
aVand novel about slavery today,
p155
aVand that is a complete collapse
p156
aVin the price of human beings \u2014
p157
aVexpensive in the past, dirt cheap now.
p158
aVEven the business programs have started
p159
aVpicking up on this.
p160
aVI just want to share a little clip for you.
p161
aa(lp162
VDaphne: OK. Llively discussion guaranteed here, as always,
p163
aVas we get macro and talk commodities.
p164
aVContinuing here in the studio with our guest Michael O'Donohue,
p165
aVhead of commodities at Four Continents Capital Management.
p166
aVAnd we're also joined by Brent Lawson
p167
aVfrom Lawson Frisk Securities.
p168
aa(lp169
VBrent Lawson: Happy to be here.
p170
aa(lp171
VD: Good to have you with us, Brent.
p172
aVNow, gentlemen ... Brent, where is your money going this year?
p173
aa(lp174
VBL: Well Daphne, we've been going short on gas and oil recently
p175
aVand casting our net just a little bit wider.
p176
aVWe really like the human being story a lot.
p177
aVIf you look at a long-term chart,
p178
aVprices are at historical lows and yet global demand
p179
aVfor forced labor is still real strong.
p180
aVSo, that's a scenario that we think we should be capitalizing on.
p181
aa(lp182
VD: Michael, what's your take on the people story? Are you interested?
p183
aa(lp184
VMichael O'Donoghue: Oh definitely. Non-voluntary labor's greatest advantage
p185
aVas an asset is the endless supply.
p186
aVWe're not about to run out of people. No other commodity has that.
p187
aa(lp188
VBL: Daphne, if I may draw your attention to one thing.
p189
aVThat is that private equity has been sniffing around,
p190
aVand that tells me that this market is about to explode.
p191
aVAfricans and Indians, as usual,
p192
aVSouth Americans, and Eastern Europeans in particular
p193
aVare on our buy list.
p194
aa(lp195
VD: Interesting. Micheal, bottom line, what do you recommend?
p196
aa(lp197
VMO: We're recommending to our clients
p198
aVa buy and hold strategy.
p199
aVThere's no need to play the market.
p200
aVThere's a lot of vulnerable people out there. It's very exciting.
p201
aa(lp202
VD: Exciting stuff indeed. Gentlemen, thank you very much.
p203
aa(lp204
VKevin Bales: Okay, you figured it out. That's a spoof.
p205
aVThough I enjoyed watching
p206
aVyour jaws drop, drop, drop, until you got it.
p207
aVMTV Europe worked with us and made that spoof,
p208
aVand they've been slipping it in between music videos
p209
aVwithout any introduction, which I think is kind of fun.
p210
aVHere's the reality.
p211
aVThe price of human beings across the last 4,000 years
p212
aVin today's money has averaged about 40,000 dollars.
p213
aVCapital purchase items.
p214
aVYou can see that the lines cross when the population explodes.
p215
aa(lp216
VThe average price of a human being today,
p217
aVaround the world, is about 90 dollars.
p218
aVThey are more expensive in places like North America.
p219
aVSlaves cost between 3,000 to 8,000 dollars in North America,
p220
aVbut I could take you places in India or Nepal
p221
aVwhere human beings can be acquired for five or 10 dollars.
p222
aVThey key here is that
p223
aVpeople have ceased to be that capital purchase item
p224
aVand become like Styrofoam cups.
p225
aVYou buy them cheaply, you use them,
p226
aVyou crumple them up, and then when you're done
p227
aVwith them you just throw them away.
p228
aa(lp229
VThese young boys are in Nepal.
p230
aVThey are basically the transport system
p231
aVon a quarry run by a slaveholder.
p232
aVThere are no roads there, so they carry loads of stone
p233
aVon their backs, often of their own weight,
p234
aVup and down the Himalaya Mountains.
p235
aVOne of their mothers said to us,
p236
aV"You know, we can't survive here,
p237
aVbut we can't even seem to die either."
p238
aVIt's a horrible situation.
p239
aVAnd if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this,
p240
aVit's that there are also \u2014
p241
aVin addition to young men like this who are still enslaved \u2014
p242
aVthere are ex-slaves who are now working to free others.
p243
aVOr, we say, Frederick Douglass is in the house.
p244
aa(lp245
VI don't know if you've ever had a daydream
p246
aVabout, "Wow. What would it be like to meet Harriet Tubman?
p247
aVWhat would it be like to meet Frederick Douglass?"
p248
aVI've got to say, one of the most exciting parts about my job
p249
aVis that I get to,
p250
aVand I want to introduce you to one of those.
p251
aVHis name is James Kofi Annan. He was a slave child in Ghana
p252
aVenslaved in the fishing industry,
p253
aVand he now, after escape and building a new life,
p254
aVhas formed an organization that we work closely with
p255
aVto go back and get people out of slavery.
p256
aVThis is not James, this is one of the kids that he works with.
p257
aa(lp258
VJames Kofi Annan (Video): He was hit with a paddle
p259
aVin the head. And this reminds me
p260
aVof my childhood when I used to work here.
p261
aa(lp262
VKB: James and our country director in Ghana,
p263
aVEmmanuel Otoo are now receiving regular death threats
p264
aVbecause the two of them managed to get
p265
aVconvictions and imprisonment for three human traffickers
p266
aVfor the very first time in Ghana
p267
aVfor enslaving people, from the fishing industry,
p268
aVfor enslaving children.
p269
aa(lp270
VNow, everything I've been telling you,
p271
aVI admit, is pretty disheartening.
p272
aVBut there is actually a very positive side to this,
p273
aVand that is this: The 27 million people
p274
aVwho are in slavery today,
p275
aVthat's a lot of people, but it's also
p276
aVthe smallest fraction
p277
aVof the global population to ever be in slavery.
p278
aVAnd likewise, the 40 billion dollars that they generate
p279
aVinto the global economy each year
p280
aVis the tiniest proportion of the global economy
p281
aVto ever be represented by slave labor.
p282
aa(lp283
VSlavery, illegal in every country
p284
aVhas been pushed to the edges of our global society.
p285
aVAnd in a way, without us even noticing,
p286
aVhas ended up standing on the precipice
p287
aVof its own extinction,
p288
aVwaiting for us to give it a big boot
p289
aVand knock it over. And get rid of it.
p290
aVAnd it can be done.
p291
aa(lp292
VNow, if we do that, if we put the resources
p293
aVand the focus to it,
p294
aVwhat does it actually cost to get people out of slavery?
p295
aVWell, first, before I even tell you the cost
p296
aVI've got to be absolutely clear.
p297
aVWe do not buy people out of slavery.
p298
aVBuying people out of slavery is like
p299
aVpaying a burglar to get your television back;
p300
aVit's abetting a crime.
p301
aVLiberation, however, costs some money.
p302
aa(lp303
VLiberation, and more importantly
p304
aVall the work that comes after liberation.
p305
aVIt's not an event, it's a process.
p306
aVIt's about helping people to build lives of dignity,
p307
aVstability, economic autonomy,
p308
aVcitizenship.
p309
aVWell, amazingly,
p310
aVin places like India where costs are very low,
p311
aVthat family, that three-generation family that you see there
p312
aVwho were in hereditary slavery \u2014
p313
aVso, that granddad there, was born a baby into slavery \u2014
p314
aVbut the total cost, amortized
p315
aVacross the rest of the work,
p316
aVwas about 150 dollars to bring that family
p317
aVout of slavery and then take them through a two year process
p318
aVto build a stable life of citizenship and education.
p319
aa(lp320
VA boy in Ghana rescued from fishing slavery, about 400 dollars.
p321
aVIn the United States, North America,
p322
aVmuch more expensive. Legal costs, medical costs ...
p323
aVwe understand that it's expensive here:
p324
aVabout 30,000 dollars.
p325
aVBut most of the people in the world in slavery
p326
aVlive in those places where
p327
aVthe costs are lowest.
p328
aVAnd in fact, the global average is about what it is
p329
aVfor Ghana.
p330
aa(lp331
VAnd that means, when you multiply it up,
p332
aVthe estimated cost of
p333
aVnot just freedom but sustainable freedom
p334
aVfor the entire 27 million people on the planet in slavery
p335
aVis something like 10.8 billion dollars \u2014
p336
aVwhat Americans spend on potato chips and pretzels,
p337
aVwhat Seattle is going to spend on its light rail system:
p338
aVusually the annual expenditure in this country on blue jeans,
p339
aVor in the last holiday period
p340
aVwhen we bought GameBoys and iPods and other tech gifts for people,
p341
aVwe spent 10.8 billion dollars.
p342
aVIntel's fourth quarter earnings: 10.8 billion.
p343
aa(lp344
VIt's not a lot of money at the global level.
p345
aVIn fact, it's peanuts.
p346
aVAnd the great thing about it is that
p347
aVit's not money down a hole,
p348
aVthere is a freedom dividend. When you let people out of slavery
p349
aVto work for themselves,
p350
aVare they motivated?
p351
aVThey take their kids out of the workplace,
p352
aVthey build a school, they say,
p353
aV"We're going to have stuff we've never had before like three squares,
p354
aVmedicine when we're sick,
p355
aVclothing when we're cold."
p356
aVThey become consumers and producers
p357
aVand local economies begin to spiral up very rapidly.
p358
aa(lp359
VThat's important, all of that
p360
aVabout how we rebuild sustainable freedom,
p361
aVbecause we'd never want to repeat
p362
aVwhat happened in this country in 1865.
p363
aVFour million people were lifted up out of slavery
p364
aVand then dumped.
p365
aVDumped without political participation,
p366
aVdecent education,
p367
aVany kind of real opportunity
p368
aVin terms of economic lives,
p369
aVand then sentenced to generations of
p370
aVviolence and prejudice and discrimination.
p371
aVAnd America is still paying the price
p372
aVfor the botched emancipation of 1865.
p373
aa(lp374
VWe have made a commitment
p375
aVthat we will never let people
p376
aVcome out of slavery on our watch,
p377
aVand end up as second class citizens.
p378
aVIt's just not going to happen.
p379
aVThis is what liberation really looks like.
p380
aVChildren rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in Ghana,
p381
aVreunited with their parents,
p382
aVand then taken with their parents back to their villages
p383
aVto rebuild their economic well-being
p384
aVso that they become slave-proof \u2014
p385
aVabsolutely unenslaveable.
p386
aa(lp387
VNow, this woman
p388
aVlived in a village in Nepal.
p389
aVWe'd been working there about a month.
p390
aVThey had just begun to come out of a hereditary kind of slavery.
p391
aVThey'd just begun to light up a little bit,
p392
aVopen up a little bit.
p393
aVBut when we went to speak with her, when we took this photograph,
p394
aVthe slaveholders were still menacing us
p395
aVfrom the sidelines. They hadn't been really pushed back.
p396
aVI was frightened. We were frightened.
p397
aVWe said to her, "Are you worried? Are you upset?"
p398
aa(lp399
VShe said, "No, because we've got hope now.
p400
aVHow could we not succeed," she said,
p401
aV"when people like you from the other side of the world
p402
aVare coming here to stand beside us?"
p403
aa(lp404
VOkay, we have to ask ourselves,
p405
aVare we willing to live in a world with slavery?
p406
aVIf we don't take action, we just leave ourselves open
p407
aVto have someone else jerk the strings
p408
aVthat tie us to slavery in the products we buy,
p409
aVand in our government policies.
p410
aVAnd yet, if there's one thing that every human being can agree on,
p411
aVI think it's that slavery should end.
p412
aa(lp413
VAnd if there is a fundamental violation
p414
aVof our human dignity
p415
aVthat we would all say is horrific,
p416
aVit's slavery.
p417
aVAnd we've got to say,
p418
aVwhat good is all of our intellectual
p419
aVand political and economic power \u2014
p420
aVand I'm really thinking intellectual power in this room \u2014
p421
aVif we can't use it to bring slavery to an end?
p422
aVI think there is enough intellectual power in this room
p423
aVto bring slavery to an end.
p424
aVAnd you know what? If we can't do that,
p425
aVif we can't use our intellectual power to end slavery,
p426
aVthere is one last question:
p427
aVAre we truly free?
p428
aVOkay, thank you so much.
