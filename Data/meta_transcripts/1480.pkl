VTwo weeks ago,
p4
aVI was sitting at the kitchen table with my wife Katya,
p5
aVand we were talking about what I was going to talk about today.
p6
aVWe have an 11-year-old son; his name is Lincoln.
p7
aVHe was sitting at the same table, doing his math homework.
p8
aVAnd during a pause in my conversation with Katya,
p9
aVI looked over at Lincoln
p10
aVand I was suddenly thunderstruck
p11
aVby a recollection of a client of mine.
p12
aa(lp13
VMy client was a guy named Will.
p14
aVHe was from North Texas.
p15
aVHe never knew his father very well,
p16
aVbecause his father left his mom while she was pregnant with him.
p17
aVAnd so, he was destined to be raised by a single mom,
p18
aVwhich might have been all right
p19
aVexcept that this particular single mom was a paranoid schizophrenic,
p20
aVand when Will was five years old,
p21
aVshe tried to kill him with a butcher knife.
p22
aa(lp23
VShe was taken away by authorities and placed in a psychiatric hospital,
p24
aVand so for the next several years Will lived with his older brother,
p25
aVuntil he committed suicide by shooting himself through the heart.
p26
aVAnd after that Will bounced around from one family member to another,
p27
aVuntil, by the time he was nine years old, he was essentially living on his own.
p28
aa(lp29
VThat morning that I was sitting with Katya and Lincoln,
p30
aVI looked at my son, and I realized that when my client, Will, was his age,
p31
aVhe'd been living by himself for two years.
p32
aVWill eventually joined a gang
p33
aVand committed a number of very serious crimes,
p34
aVincluding, most seriously of all,
p35
aVa horrible, tragic murder.
p36
aVAnd Will was ultimately executed as punishment for that crime.
p37
aa(lp38
VBut I don't want to talk today about the morality of capital punishment.
p39
aVI certainly think that my client shouldn't have been executed,
p40
aVbut what I would like to do today instead
p41
aVis talk about the death penalty in a way I've never done before,
p42
aVin a way that is entirely noncontroversial.
p43
aa(lp44
VI think that's possible,
p45
aVbecause there is a corner of the death penalty debate \u2014
p46
aVmaybe the most important corner \u2014
p47
aVwhere everybody agrees,
p48
aVwhere the most ardent death penalty supporters
p49
aVand the most vociferous abolitionists are on exactly the same page.
p50
aVThat's the corner I want to explore.
p51
aa(lp52
VBefore I do that, though, I want to spend a couple of minutes
p53
aVtelling you how a death penalty case unfolds,
p54
aVand then I want to tell you two lessons
p55
aVthat I have learned over the last 20 years as a death penalty lawyer
p56
aVfrom watching well more than a hundred cases unfold in this way.
p57
aa(lp58
VYou can think of a death penalty case as a story that has four chapters.
p59
aVThe first chapter of every case is exactly the same, and it is tragic.
p60
aVIt begins with the murder of an innocent human being,
p61
aVand it's followed by a trial
p62
aVwhere the murderer is convicted and sent to death row,
p63
aVand that death sentence is ultimately upheld by the state appellate court.
p64
aa(lp65
VThe second chapter consists of a complicated legal proceeding
p66
aVknown as a state habeas corpus appeal.
p67
aVThe third chapter is an even more complicated legal proceeding
p68
aVknown as a federal habeas corpus proceeding.
p69
aVAnd the fourth chapter is one where a variety of things can happen.
p70
aVThe lawyers might file a clemency petition,
p71
aVthey might initiate even more complex litigation,
p72
aVor they might not do anything at all.
p73
aVBut that fourth chapter always ends with an execution.
p74
aa(lp75
VWhen I started representing death row inmates more than 20 years ago,
p76
aVpeople on death row did not have a right to a lawyer
p77
aVin either the second or the fourth chapter of this story.
p78
aVThey were on their own.
p79
aVIn fact, it wasn't until the late 1980s
p80
aVthat they acquired a right to a lawyer during the third chapter of the story.
p81
aVSo what all of these death row inmates had to do was rely on volunteer lawyers
p82
aVto handle their legal proceedings.
p83
aVThe problem is that there were way more guys on death row
p84
aVthan there were lawyers
p85
aVwho had both the interest and the expertise to work on these cases.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd so inevitably,
p88
aVlawyers drifted to cases that were already in chapter four \u2014
p89
aVthat makes sense, of course.
p90
aVThose are the cases that are most urgent;
p91
aVthose are the guys who are closest to being executed.
p92
aVSome of these lawyers were successful;
p93
aVthey managed to get new trials for their clients.
p94
aVOthers of them managed to extend the lives of their clients,
p95
aVsometimes by years, sometimes by months.
p96
aa(lp97
VBut the one thing that didn't happen
p98
aVwas that there was never a serious and sustained decline
p99
aVin the number of annual executions in Texas.
p100
aVIn fact, as you can see from this graph,
p101
aVfrom the time that the Texas execution apparatus got efficient
p102
aVin the mid- to late 1990s,
p103
aVthere have only been a couple of years
p104
aVwhere the number of annual executions dipped below 20.
p105
aa(lp106
VIn a typical year in Texas,
p107
aVwe're averaging about two people a month.
p108
aVIn some years in Texas, we've executed close to 40 people,
p109
aVand this number has never significantly declined over the last 15 years.
p110
aVAnd yet, at the same time that we continue to execute
p111
aVabout the same number of people every year,
p112
aVthe number of people who we're sentencing to death on an annual basis
p113
aVhas dropped rather steeply.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo we have this paradox,
p116
aVwhich is that the number of annual executions has remained high
p117
aVbut the number of new death sentences has gone down.
p118
aVWhy is that?
p119
aVIt can't be attributed to a decline in the murder rate,
p120
aVbecause the murder rate has not declined nearly so steeply
p121
aVas the red line on that graph has gone down.
p122
aVWhat has happened instead
p123
aVis that juries have started to sentence more and more people to prison
p124
aVfor the rest of their lives without the possibility of parole,
p125
aVrather than sending them to the execution chamber.
p126
aa(lp127
VWhy has that happened?
p128
aVIt hasn't happened because of a dissolution
p129
aVof popular support for the death penalty.
p130
aVDeath penalty opponents take great solace in the fact
p131
aVthat death penalty support in Texas is at an all-time low.
p132
aVDo you know what all-time low in Texas means?
p133
aVIt means that it's in the low 60 percent.
p134
aVNow, that's really good compared to the mid-1980s,
p135
aVwhen it was in excess of 80 percent,
p136
aVbut we can't explain the decline in death sentences
p137
aVand the affinity for life without the possibility of parole
p138
aVby an erosion of support for the death penalty,
p139
aVbecause people still support the death penalty.
p140
aa(lp141
VWhat's happened to cause this phenomenon?
p142
aVWhat's happened is that lawyers who represent death row inmates
p143
aVhave shifted their focus to earlier and earlier chapters
p144
aVof the death penalty story.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo 25 years ago, they focused on chapter four.
p147
aVAnd they went from chapter four 25 years ago
p148
aVto chapter three in the late 1980s.
p149
aVAnd they went from chapter three in the late 1980s
p150
aVto chapter two in the mid-1990s.
p151
aVAnd beginning in the mid- to late 1990s,
p152
aVthey began to focus on chapter one of the story.
p153
aa(lp154
VNow, you might think that this decline in death sentences
p155
aVand the increase in the number of life sentences
p156
aVis a good thing or a bad thing.
p157
aVI don't want to have a conversation about that today.
p158
aVAll that I want to tell you is that the reason that this has happened
p159
aVis because death penalty lawyers have understood
p160
aVthat the earlier you intervene in a case,
p161
aVthe greater the likelihood that you're going to save your client's life.
p162
aVThat's the first thing I've learned.
p163
aa(lp164
VHere's the second thing I learned:
p165
aVMy client Will was not the exception to the rule;
p166
aVhe was the rule.
p167
aVI sometimes say, if you tell me the name of a death row inmate \u2014
p168
aVdoesn't matter what state he's in,
p169
aVdoesn't matter if I've ever met him before \u2014
p170
aVI'll write his biography for you.
p171
aVAnd eight out of 10 times,
p172
aVthe details of that biography will be more or less accurate.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd the reason for that is that 80 percent of the people on death row
p175
aVare people who came from the same sort of dysfunctional family that Will did.
p176
aVEighty percent of the people on death row
p177
aVare people who had exposure to the juvenile justice system.
p178
aVThat's the second lesson that I've learned.
p179
aa(lp180
VNow we're right on the cusp of that corner
p181
aVwhere everybody's going to agree.
p182
aVPeople in this room might disagree
p183
aVabout whether Will should have been executed,
p184
aVbut I think everybody would agree
p185
aVthat the best possible version of his story
p186
aVwould be a story where no murder ever occurs.
p187
aVHow do we do that?
p188
aa(lp189
VWhen our son Lincoln was working on that math problem two weeks ago,
p190
aVit was a big, gnarly problem.
p191
aVAnd he was learning how, when you have a big old gnarly problem,
p192
aVsometimes the solution is to slice it into smaller problems.
p193
aVThat's what we do for most problems \u2014
p194
aVin math, in physics, even in social policy \u2014
p195
aVwe slice them into smaller, more manageable problems.
p196
aVBut every once in a while, as Dwight Eisenhower said,
p197
aVthe way you solve a problem is to make it bigger.
p198
aa(lp199
VThe way we solve this problem
p200
aVis to make the issue of the death penalty bigger.
p201
aVWe have to say, all right.
p202
aVWe have these four chapters of a death penalty story,
p203
aVbut what happens before that story begins?
p204
aVHow can we intervene in the life of a murderer
p205
aVbefore he's a murderer?
p206
aVWhat options do we have to nudge that person off of the path
p207
aVthat is going to lead to a result that everybody \u2014
p208
aVdeath penalty supporters and death penalty opponents \u2014
p209
aVstill think is a bad result:
p210
aVthe murder of an innocent human being?
p211
aa(lp212
VYou know, sometimes people say that something isn't rocket science.
p213
aVAnd by that, what they mean is rocket science is really complicated
p214
aVand this problem that we're talking about now is really simple.
p215
aVWell that's rocket science;
p216
aVthat's the mathematical expression for the thrust created by a rocket.
p217
aVWhat we're talking about today is just as complicated.
p218
aVWhat we're talking about today is also rocket science.
p219
aa(lp220
VMy client Will and 80 percent of the people on death row
p221
aVhad five chapters in their lives
p222
aVthat came before the four chapters of the death penalty story.
p223
aVI think of these five chapters as points of intervention,
p224
aVplaces in their lives
p225
aVwhen our society could've intervened in their lives
p226
aVand nudged them off of the path that they were on
p227
aVthat created a consequence that we all \u2014
p228
aVdeath penalty supporters or death penalty opponents \u2014
p229
aVsay was a bad result.
p230
aa(lp231
VNow, during each of these five chapters:
p232
aVwhen his mother was pregnant with him;
p233
aVin his early childhood years;
p234
aVwhen he was in elementary school;
p235
aVwhen he was in middle school and then high school;
p236
aVand when he was in the juvenile justice system \u2014
p237
aVduring each of those five chapters,
p238
aVthere were a wide variety of things that society could have done.
p239
aVIn fact, if we just imagine
p240
aVthat there are five different modes of intervention,
p241
aVthe way that society could intervene in each of those five chapters,
p242
aVand we could mix and match them any way we want,
p243
aVthere are 3,000 \u2014 more than 3,000 \u2014 possible strategies
p244
aVthat we could embrace
p245
aVin order to nudge kids like Will off of the path that they're on.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo I'm not standing here today with the solution.
p248
aVBut the fact that we still have a lot to learn,
p249
aVthat doesn't mean that we don't know a lot already.
p250
aVWe know from experience in other states
p251
aVthat there are a wide variety of modes of intervention
p252
aVthat we could be using in Texas,
p253
aVand in every other state that isn't using them,
p254
aVin order to prevent a consequence that we all agree is bad.
p255
aa(lp256
VI'll just mention a few.
p257
aVI won't talk today about reforming the legal system.
p258
aVThat's probably a topic
p259
aVthat is best reserved for a room full of lawyers and judges.
p260
aVInstead, let me talk about a couple of modes of intervention
p261
aVthat we can all help accomplish,
p262
aVbecause they are modes of intervention that will come about
p263
aVwhen legislators and policymakers, when taxpayers and citizens,
p264
aVagree that that's what we ought to be doing
p265
aVand that's how we ought to be spending our money.
p266
aa(lp267
VWe could be providing early childhood care
p268
aVfor economically disadvantaged and otherwise troubled kids,
p269
aVand we could be doing it for free.
p270
aVAnd we could be nudging kids like Will off of the path that we're on.
p271
aVThere are other states that do that, but we don't.
p272
aa(lp273
VWe could be providing special schools,
p274
aVat both the high school level and the middle school level,
p275
aVbut even in K-5,
p276
aVthat target economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids,
p277
aVand particularly kids who have had exposure to the juvenile justice system.
p278
aVThere are a handful of states that do that;
p279
aVTexas doesn't.
p280
aa(lp281
VThere's one other thing we can be doing \u2014 well, there are a bunch of other things \u2014
p282
aVthere's one other thing that I'm going to mention,
p283
aVand this is going to be the only controversial thing that I say today.
p284
aVWe could be intervening much more aggressively
p285
aVinto dangerously dysfunctional homes,
p286
aVand getting kids out of them
p287
aVbefore their moms pick up butcher knives and threaten to kill them.
p288
aVIf we're going to do that, we need a place to put them.
p289
aa(lp290
VEven if we do all of those things,
p291
aVsome kids are going to fall through the cracks
p292
aVand they're going to end up in that last chapter
p293
aVbefore the murder story begins,
p294
aVthey're going to end up in the juvenile justice system.
p295
aVAnd even if that happens, it's not yet too late.
p296
aVThere's still time to nudge them,
p297
aVif we think about nudging them rather than just punishing them.
p298
aa(lp299
VThere are two professors in the Northeast \u2014
p300
aVone at Yale and one at Maryland \u2014
p301
aVthey set up a school that is attached to a juvenile prison.
p302
aVAnd the kids are in prison, but they go to school
p303
aVfrom eight in the morning until four in the afternoon.
p304
aVNow, it was logistically difficult.
p305
aVThey had to recruit teachers who wanted to teach inside a prison,
p306
aVthey had to establish strict separation
p307
aVbetween the people who work at the school and the prison authorities,
p308
aVand most dauntingly of all,
p309
aVthey needed to invent a new curriculum because you know what?
p310
aVPeople don't come into and out of prison on a semester basis.
p311
aa(lp312
V(Laughter)
p313
aa(lp314
VBut they did all those things.
p315
aa(lp316
VNow, what do all of these things have in common?
p317
aVWhat all of these things have in common is that they cost money.
p318
aVSome of the people in the room might be old enough
p319
aVto remember the guy on the old oil filter commercial.
p320
aVHe used to say, "Well, you can pay me now or you can pay me later."
p321
aVWhat we're doing in the death penalty system
p322
aVis we're paying later.
p323
aa(lp324
VBut the thing is that for every 15,000 dollars
p325
aVthat we spend intervening
p326
aVin the lives of economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids
p327
aVin those earlier chapters,
p328
aVwe save 80,000 dollars in crime-related costs down the road.
p329
aVEven if you don't agree that there's a moral imperative that we do it,
p330
aVit just makes economic sense.
p331
aa(lp332
VI want to tell you about the last conversation that I had with Will.
p333
aVIt was the day that he was going to be executed,
p334
aVand we were just talking.
p335
aVThere was nothing left to do in his case.
p336
aVAnd we were talking about his life.
p337
aVAnd he was talking first about his dad, who he hardly knew, who had died,
p338
aVand then about his mom, who he did know, who was still alive.
p339
aa(lp340
VAnd I said to him,
p341
aV"I know the story.
p342
aVI've read the records.
p343
aVI know that she tried to kill you."
p344
aVI said, "But I've always wondered
p345
aVwhether you really actually remember that."
p346
aVI said, "I don't remember anything from when I was five years old.
p347
aVMaybe you just remember somebody telling you."
p348
aa(lp349
VAnd he looked at me and he leaned forward,
p350
aVand he said, "Professor," \u2014
p351
aVhe'd known me for 12 years, he still called me Professor.
p352
aVHe said, "Professor, I don't mean any disrespect by this,
p353
aVbut when your mama picks up a butcher knife
p354
aVthat looks bigger than you are,
p355
aVand chases you through the house screaming she's going to kill you,
p356
aVand you have to lock yourself in the bathroom
p357
aVand lean against the door
p358
aVand holler for help until the police get there,"
p359
aVhe looked at me and he said,
p360
aV"that's something you don't forget."
p361
aa(lp362
VI hope there's one thing you all won't forget:
p363
aVIn between the time you arrived here this morning
p364
aVand the time we break for lunch,
p365
aVthere are going to be four homicides in the United States.
p366
aVWe're going to devote enormous social resources
p367
aVto punishing the people who commit those crimes,
p368
aVand that's appropriate
p369
aVbecause we should punish people who do bad things.
p370
aVBut three of those crimes are preventable.
p371
aa(lp372
VIf we make the picture bigger
p373
aVand devote our attention to the earlier chapters,
p374
aVthen we're never going to write the first sentence
p375
aVthat begins the death penalty story.
p376
aa(lp377
VThank you.
