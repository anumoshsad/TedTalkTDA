VWhen I was 14 years old, I was interested in science \u2014
p4
aVfascinated by it, excited to learn about it.
p5
aVAnd I had a high school science teacher who would say to the class,
p6
aV"The girls don't have to listen to this."
p7
aa(lp8
VEncouraging, yes.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VI chose not to listen \u2014 but to that statement alone.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo let me take you to the Andes mountains in Chile,
p15
aV500 kilometers, 300 miles northeast of Santiago.
p16
aVIt's very remote, it's very dry and it's very beautiful.
p17
aVAnd there's not much there.
p18
aVThere are condors, there are tarantulas,
p19
aVand at night, when the light dims,
p20
aVit reveals one of the darkest skies on Earth.
p21
aVIt's kind of a magic place, the mountain.
p22
aVIt's a wonderful combination of very remote mountaintop
p23
aVwith exquisitely sophisticated technology.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd our ancestors, for as long as there's been recorded history,
p26
aVhave looked at the night sky and pondered the nature of our existence.
p27
aVAnd we're no exception, our generation.
p28
aVThe only difficulty is that the night sky now is blocked
p29
aVby the glare of city lights.
p30
aVAnd so astronomers go to these very remote mountaintops
p31
aVto view and to study the cosmos.
p32
aVSo telescopes are our window to the cosmos.
p33
aa(lp34
VIt's no exaggeration to say that the Southern Hemisphere is going to be
p35
aVthe future of astronomy for the 21st century.
p36
aVWe have an array of existing telescopes already,
p37
aVin the Andes mountains in Chile,
p38
aVand that's soon to be joined by a really sensational array of new capability.
p39
aVThere will be two international groups that are going to be building
p40
aVgiant telescopes, sensitive to optical radiation, as our eyes are.
p41
aVThere will be a survey telescope
p42
aVthat will be scanning the sky every few nights.
p43
aVThere will be radio telescopes,
p44
aVsensitive to long-wavelength radio radiation.
p45
aVAnd then there will be telescopes in space.
p46
aVThere'll be a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope;
p47
aVit's called the James Webb Telescope,
p48
aVand it will be launched in 2018.
p49
aVThere'll be a satellite called TESS
p50
aVthat will discover planets outside of our solar system.
p51
aa(lp52
VFor the last decade, I've been leading a group \u2014
p53
aVa consortium \u2014 international group,
p54
aVto build what will be, when it's finished,
p55
aVthe largest optical telescope in existence.
p56
aVIt's called the Giant Magellan Telescope, or GMT.
p57
aVThis telescope is going to have mirrors that are 8.4 meters in diameter \u2014
p58
aVeach of the mirrors.
p59
aVThat's almost 27 feet.
p60
aVSo it dwarfs this stage \u2014 maybe out to the fourth row in this audience.
p61
aVEach of the seven mirrors in this telescope
p62
aVwill be almost 27 feet in diameter.
p63
aVTogether, the seven mirrors in this telescope will comprise
p64
aV80 feet in diameter.
p65
aVSo, essentially the size of this entire auditorium.
p66
aVThe whole telescope will stand about 43 meters high,
p67
aVand again, being in Rio,
p68
aVsome of you have been to see the statue of the giant Christ.
p69
aVThe scale is comparable in height;
p70
aVin fact, it's smaller than this telescope will be.
p71
aVIt's comparable to the size of the Statue of Liberty.
p72
aVAnd it's going to be housed in an enclosure that's 22 stories \u2014
p73
aV60 meters high.
p74
aVBut it's an unusual building to protect this telescope.
p75
aVIt will have open windows to the sky,
p76
aVbe able to point and look at the sky,
p77
aVand it will actually rotate on a base \u2014
p78
aV2,000 tons of rotating building.
p79
aa(lp80
VThe Giant Magellan Telescope will have 10 times the resolution
p81
aVof the Hubble Space Telescope.
p82
aVIt will be 20 million times more sensitive than the human eye.
p83
aVAnd it may, for the first time ever, be capable of finding life on planets
p84
aVoutside of our solar system.
p85
aVIt's going to allow us to look back at the first light in the universe \u2014
p86
aVliterally, the dawn of the cosmos.
p87
aVThe cosmic dawn.
p88
aVIt's a telescope that's going to allow us to peer back,
p89
aVwitness galaxies as they were when they were actually assembling,
p90
aVthe first black holes in the universe, the first galaxies.
p91
aa(lp92
VNow, for thousands of years, we have been studying the cosmos,
p93
aVwe've been wondering about our place in the universe.
p94
aVThe ancient Greeks told us
p95
aVthat the Earth was the center of the universe.
p96
aVFive hundred years ago, Copernicus displaced the Earth,
p97
aVand put the Sun at the heart of the cosmos.
p98
aVAnd as we've learned over the centuries,
p99
aVsince Galileo Galilei, the Italian scientist,
p100
aVfirst turned, in that time, a two-inch, very small telescope, to the sky,
p101
aVevery time we have built larger telescopes,
p102
aVwe have learned something about the universe;
p103
aVwe've made discoveries, without exception.
p104
aVWe've learned in the 20th century that the universe is expanding
p105
aVand that our own solar system is not at the center of that expansion.
p106
aVWe know now that the universe is made of about 100 billion galaxies
p107
aVthat are visible to us,
p108
aVand each one of those galaxies has 100 billion stars within it.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo we're looking now at the deepest image of the cosmos
p111
aVthat's ever been taken.
p112
aVIt was taken using the Hubble Space Telescope,
p113
aVand by pointing the telescope at what was previously a blank region of sky,
p114
aVbefore the launch of Hubble.
p115
aVAnd if you can imagine this tiny area,
p116
aVit's only one-fiftieth of the size of the full moon.
p117
aVSo, if you can imagine the full moon.
p118
aVAnd there are now 10,000 galaxies visible within that image.
p119
aVAnd the faintness of those images and the tiny size is only a result
p120
aVof the fact that those galaxies are so far away, the vast distances.
p121
aVAnd each of those galaxies may contain within it
p122
aVa few billion or even hundreds of billions of individual stars.
p123
aVTelescopes are like time machines.
p124
aVSo the farther back we look in space, the further back we see in time.
p125
aVAnd they're like light buckets \u2014 literally, they collect light.
p126
aVSo larger the bucket, the larger the mirror we have,
p127
aVthe more light we can see, and the farther back we can view.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo, we've learned in the last century
p130
aVthat there are exotic objects in the universe \u2014 black holes.
p131
aVWe've even learned that there's dark matter and dark energy
p132
aVthat we can't see.
p133
aVSo you're looking now at an actual image of dark matter.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VYou got it. Not all audiences get that.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VSo the way we infer the presence of dark matter \u2014
p142
aVwe can't see it \u2014 but there's an unmistakable tug, due to gravity.
p143
aVWe now can look out, we see this sea of galaxies
p144
aVin a universe that's expanding.
p145
aa(lp146
VWhat I do myself is to measure the expansion of the universe,
p147
aVand one of the projects that I carried out in the 1990s
p148
aVused the Hubble Space Telescope to measure how fast the universe is expanding.
p149
aVWe can now trace back to 14 billion years.
p150
aVWe've learned over time that stars have individual histories;
p151
aVthat is, they have birth, they have middle ages
p152
aVand some of them even have dramatic deaths.
p153
aVSo the embers from those stars actually then form the new stars that we see,
p154
aVmost of which turn out to have planets going around them.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd one of the really surprising results in the last 20 years
p157
aVhas been the discovery of other planets going around other stars.
p158
aVThese are called exoplanets.
p159
aVAnd until 1995, we didn't even know the existence of any other planets,
p160
aVother than going around our own sun.
p161
aVBut now, there are almost 2,000 other planets orbiting other stars
p162
aVthat we can now detect, measure masses for.
p163
aVThere are 500 of those that are multiple-planet systems.
p164
aVAnd there are 4,000 \u2014 and still counting \u2014 other candidates
p165
aVfor planets orbiting other stars.
p166
aVThey come in a bewildering variety of different kinds.
p167
aVThere are Jupiter-like planets that are hot,
p168
aVthere are other planets that are icy, there are water worlds
p169
aVand there are rocky planets like the Earth, so-called "super-Earths,"
p170
aVand there have even been planets that have been speculated diamond worlds.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo we know there's at least one planet, our own Earth, in which there is life.
p173
aVWe've even found planets that are orbiting two stars.
p174
aVThat's no longer the province of science fiction.
p175
aVSo around our own planet, we know there's life,
p176
aVwe've developed a complex life, we now can question our own origins.
p177
aVAnd given all that we've discovered, the overwhelming numbers now suggest
p178
aVthat there may be millions, perhaps \u2014 maybe even hundreds of millions \u2014
p179
aVof other [planets] that are close enough \u2014
p180
aVjust the right distance from their stars that they're orbiting \u2014
p181
aVto have the existence of liquid water and maybe could potentially support life.
p182
aVSo we marvel now at those odds, the overwhelming odds,
p183
aVand the amazing thing is that within the next decade,
p184
aVthe GMT may be able to take spectra of the atmospheres of those planets,
p185
aVand determine whether or not they have the potential for life.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo, what is the GMT project?
p188
aVIt's an international project.
p189
aVIt includes Australia, South Korea, and I'm happy to say, being here in Rio,
p190
aVthat the newest partner in our telescope is Brazil.
p191
aa(lp192
V(Applause)
p193
aa(lp194
VIt also includes a number of institutions across the United States,
p195
aVincluding Harvard University,
p196
aVthe Smithsonian and the Carnegie Institutions,
p197
aVand the Universities of Arizona, Chicago, Texas-Austin and Texas A&M University.
p198
aVIt also involves Chile.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo, the making of the mirrors in this telescope is also fascinating
p201
aVin its own right.
p202
aVTake chunks of glass, melt them in a furnace that is itself rotating.
p203
aVThis happens underneath the football stadium
p204
aVat the University of Arizona.
p205
aVIt's tucked away under 52,000 seats.
p206
aVNobody know it's happening.
p207
aVAnd there's essentially a rotating cauldron.
p208
aVThe mirrors are cast and they're cooled very slowly,
p209
aVand then they're polished to an exquisite precision.
p210
aVAnd so, if you think about the precision of these mirrors,
p211
aVthe bumps on the mirror, over the entire 27 feet,
p212
aVamount to less than one-millionth of an inch.
p213
aVSo, can you visualize that?
p214
aVOw!
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VThat's one five-thousandths of the width of one of my hairs,
p219
aVover this entire 27 feet.
p220
aVIt's a spectacular achievement.
p221
aVIt's what allows us to have the precision that we will have.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo, what does that precision buy us?
p224
aVSo the GMT, if you can imagine \u2014
p225
aVif I were to hold up a coin, which I just happen to have,
p226
aVand I look at the face of that coin, I can see from here
p227
aVthe writing on the coin; I can see the face on that coin.
p228
aVMy guess that even in the front row, you can't see that.
p229
aVBut if we were to turn the Giant Magellan Telescope,
p230
aVall 80-feet diameter that we see in this auditorium,
p231
aVand point it 200 miles away,
p232
aVif I were standing in São Paulo, we could resolve the face of this coin.
p233
aVThat's the extraordinary resolution and power of this telescope.
p234
aVAnd if we were \u2014
p235
aa(lp236
V(Applause)
p237
aa(lp238
VIf an astronaut went up to the Moon, a quarter of a million miles away,
p239
aVand lit a candle \u2014 a single candle \u2014
p240
aVthen we would be able to detect it, using the GMT.
p241
aVQuite extraordinary.
p242
aa(lp243
VThis is a simulated image of a cluster in a nearby galaxy.
p244
aV"Nearby" is astronomical, it's all relative.
p245
aVIt's tens of millions of light-years away.
p246
aVThis is what this cluster would look like.
p247
aVSo look at those four bright objects,
p248
aVand now lets compare it with a camera on the Hubble Space Telescope.
p249
aVYou can see faint detail that starts to come through.
p250
aVAnd now finally \u2014 and look how dramatic this is \u2014 this is what the GMT will see.
p251
aVSo, keep your eyes on those bright images again.
p252
aVThis is what we see on one of the most powerful existing telescopes on the Earth,
p253
aVand this, again, what the GMT will see.
p254
aVExtraordinary precision.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo, where are we?
p257
aVWe have now leveled the top of the mountaintop in Chile.
p258
aVWe blasted that off.
p259
aVWe've tested and polished the first mirror.
p260
aVWe've cast the second and the third mirrors.
p261
aVAnd we're about to cast the fourth mirror.
p262
aVWe had a series of reviews this year,
p263
aVinternational panels that came in and reviewed us,
p264
aVand said, "You're ready to go to construction."
p265
aVAnd so we plan on building this telescope with the first four mirrors.
p266
aVWe want to get on the air quickly, and be taking science data \u2014
p267
aVwhat we astronomers call "first light," in 2021.
p268
aVAnd the full telescope will be finished in the middle of the next decade,
p269
aVwith all seven mirrors.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo we're now poised to look back at the distant universe,
p272
aVthe cosmic dawn.
p273
aVWe'll be able to study other planets in exquisite detail.
p274
aa(lp275
VBut for me, one of the most exciting things about building the GMT
p276
aVis the opportunity to actually discover something
p277
aVthat we don't know about \u2014 that we can't even imagine at this point,
p278
aVsomething completely new.
p279
aVAnd my hope is that with the construction of this and other facilities,
p280
aVthat many young women and men will be inspired to reach for the stars.
p281
aa(lp282
VThank you very much.
p283
aVObrigado.
p284
aa(lp285
V(Applause)
p286
aa(lp287
VBruno Giussani: Thank you, Wendy.
p288
aVStay with me, because I have a question for you.
p289
aVYou mentioned different facilities.
p290
aVSo the Magellan Telescope is going up, but also ALMA and others in Chile
p291
aVand elsewhere, including in Hawaii.
p292
aVIs it about cooperation and complementarity, or about competition?
p293
aVI know there's competition in terms of funding, but what about the science?
p294
aa(lp295
VWendy Freedman: In terms of the science, they're very complementary.
p296
aVThe telescopes that are in space, the telescopes on the ground,
p297
aVtelescopes with different wavelength capability,
p298
aVtelescopes even that are similar, but different instruments \u2014
p299
aVthey will all look at different parts of the questions that we're asking.
p300
aVSo when we discover other planets, we'll be able to test those observations,
p301
aVwe'll be able to measure the atmospheres,
p302
aVbe able to look in space with very high resolution.
p303
aVSo, they're very complementary.
p304
aVYou're right about the funding, we compete;
p305
aVbut scientifically, it's very complementary.
p306
aa(lp307
