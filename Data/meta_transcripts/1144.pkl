VMy name is Amit.
p4
aVAnd 18 months ago, I had another job at Google,
p5
aVand I pitched this idea
p6
aVof doing something with museums and art
p7
aVto my boss who's actually here,
p8
aVand she allowed me to do it.
p9
aVAnd it took 18 months.
p10
aVA lot of fun, negotiations and stories, I can tell you,
p11
aVwith 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
p12
aVBut I'm going to focus on the demo.
p13
aVThere are a lot of stories about why we did this.
p14
aa(lp15
VI think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide,
p16
aVand it's access.
p17
aVAnd I grew up in India.
p18
aVI had a great education \u2014 I'm not complaining \u2014
p19
aVbut I didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks.
p20
aVAnd so when I started traveling and going to these museums,
p21
aVI started learning a lot.
p22
aVAnd while working at Google,
p23
aVI tried to put this desire
p24
aVto make it more accessible with technology together.
p25
aVSo we formed a team, a great team of people,
p26
aVand we started doing this.
p27
aa(lp28
VI'm going to probably get into the demo
p29
aVand then tell you a couple of the interesting things
p30
aVwe've had since launch.
p31
aVSo, simple: you come to GoogleArtProject.com.
p32
aVYou look around at all these museums here.
p33
aVYou've got the Uffizi, you've got the MoMA,
p34
aVthe Hermitage, the Rijks, the Van Gogh.
p35
aVI'm going to actually get to one of my favorites,
p36
aVthe Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
p37
aVTwo ways of going in \u2014 very simple.
p38
aVClick and, bang, you're in this museum.
p39
aVIt doesn't matter where you are \u2014
p40
aVBombay, Mexico, it doesn't really matter.
p41
aVYou move around, you have fun.
p42
aVYou want to navigate around the museum?
p43
aVOpen the plan up,
p44
aVand, in one click, jump.
p45
aVYou're in there, you want to go to the end of the corridor.
p46
aVKeep going. Have fun.
p47
aVExplore.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Applause)
p50
aa(lp51
VThanks. I haven't come to the best part.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VSo now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings,
p56
aV"The Harvesters" by Pieter Bruegel at the Met.
p57
aVI see this plus sign.
p58
aVIf the museum has given us the image, you click on it.
p59
aVNow this is one of the images.
p60
aVSo this is all of the meta-data information.
p61
aVFor those of you who are truly interested in art,
p62
aVyou can click this \u2014 but I'm going to click this off right now.
p63
aVAnd this is one of these images that we captured
p64
aVin what we call gigapixel technology.
p65
aVSo this image, for example,
p66
aVhas close to, I think, around 10 billion pixels.
p67
aVAnd I get a lot of people asking me:
p68
aV"What do you get for 10 billion pixels?"
p69
aVSo I'm going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels.
p70
aVYou can zoom around very simply.
p71
aVYou see some fun stuff happening here.
p72
aVI love this guy; his expression is priceless.
p73
aa(lp74
VBut then you really want to go deep.
p75
aVAnd so I started playing around,
p76
aVand I found something going on over here.
p77
aVAnd I was like, "Hold on. That sounds interesting."
p78
aVWent in, and I started noticing
p79
aVthat these kids were actually beating something.
p80
aVI did a little research, spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met,
p81
aVand actually found out that this is a game
p82
aVcalled squall,
p83
aVwhich involves beating a goose with a stick
p84
aVon Shrove Tuesday.
p85
aVAnd apparently it was quite popular.
p86
aVI don't know why they did it,
p87
aVbut I learned something about it.
p88
aVNow just to get really deep in, you can really get to the cracks.
p89
aVNow just to give you some perspective,
p90
aVI'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get.
p91
aVHere is where we were,
p92
aVand this is the painting.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Applause)
p95
aa(lp96
VThe best is yet to come \u2014 so in a second.
p97
aVSo now let's just quickly
p98
aVjump into the MoMA, again in New York.
p99
aVSo another one of my favorites, "The Starry Night."
p100
aVNow the example I showed you was all about finding details.
p101
aVBut what if you want to see brush strokes?
p102
aVAnd what if you want to see
p103
aVhow Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece?
p104
aVYou zoom in. You really go in.
p105
aVI'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting,
p106
aVand I'm really going to get to the cracks.
p107
aVThis is "The Starry Night,"
p108
aVI think, never seen like this before.
p109
aa(lp110
VI'm going to show you my other favorite feature.
p111
aVThere's a lot of other stuff here, but I don't have time.
p112
aVThis is the real cool part. It's called Collections.
p113
aVAny one of you, anybody \u2014
p114
aVdoesn't matter if you're rich, if you're poor,
p115
aVif you have a fancy house \u2014 doesn't matter.
p116
aVYou can go and create your own museum online \u2014
p117
aVcreate your own collection across all these images.
p118
aVVery simply, you go in \u2014
p119
aVand I've created this, called The Power of Zoom \u2014
p120
aVyou can just zoom around.
p121
aVThis is "The Ambassadors," based in the National Gallery.
p122
aVYou can annotate the stuff, send it to your friends
p123
aVand really get a conversation going
p124
aVabout what you're feeling
p125
aVwhen you go through these masterpieces.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo I think, in conclusion,
p128
aVfor me, the main thing
p129
aVis that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google.
p130
aVIt doesn't, in my opinion, even come from the museums.
p131
aVI probably shouldn't say that.
p132
aVIt really comes from these artists.
p133
aVAnd that's been my humbling experience in this.
p134
aVI mean, I hope in this digital medium
p135
aVthat we do justice to their artwork
p136
aVand represent it properly online.
p137
aVAnd the biggest question I get asked nowadays
p138
aVis, "Did you do this
p139
aVto replicate the experience of going to a museum?"
p140
aVAnd the answer is no.
p141
aVIt's to supplement the experience.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd that's it. Thank you.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Applause)
p146
aa(lp147
VThank you.
