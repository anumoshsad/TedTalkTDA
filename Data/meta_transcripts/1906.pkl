VPat Mitchell: Your first time back on the TEDWomen stage.
p4
aa(lp5
VSheryl Sandberg: First time back. Nice to see everyone. It's always so nice to look out
p6
aVand see so many women.
p7
aVIt's so not my regular experience,  as I know anyone else's.
p8
aa(lp9
VPM: So when we first started talking about, maybe the subject wouldn't be social media,
p10
aVwhich we assumed it would be, but  that you had very much on your mind
p11
aVthe missing leadership positions, particularly  in the sector of technology and social media.
p12
aVBut how did that evolve for you as a thought, and end up being the TED Talk that you gave?
p13
aa(lp14
VSS: So I was really scared to get on  this stage and talk about women,
p15
aVbecause I grew up in the business  world, as I think so many of us did.
p16
aVYou never talk about being a woman, because  someone might notice that you're a woman, right?
p17
aVThey might notice. Or worse, if you say "woman,"  people on the other end of the table
p18
aVthink you're asking for special  treatment, or complaining.
p19
aVOr worse, about to sue them.  And so I went through \u2014 (Laughter)
p20
aVRight? I went through my entire business career,
p21
aVand never spoke about being a woman,  never spoke about it publicly.
p22
aVBut I also had noticed that it wasn't working.
p23
aa(lp24
VI came out of college over  20 years ago, and I thought
p25
aVthat all of my peers were men and women,  all the people above me were all men,
p26
aVbut that would change,
p27
aVbecause your generation had done such  an amazing job fighting for equality,
p28
aVequality was now ours for the taking. And it wasn't.
p29
aVBecause year after year, I was one of fewer and fewer,
p30
aVand now, often the only woman in a room.
p31
aVAnd I talked to a bunch of people about,
p32
aVshould I give a speech at TEDWomen  about women, and they said, oh no, no.
p33
aVIt will end your business career. You  cannot be a serious business executive
p34
aVand speak about being a woman.  You'll never be taken seriously again.
p35
aa(lp36
VBut fortunately, there were the few, the proud \u2014 like you \u2014 who told me I should give the speech,
p37
aVand I asked myself the question  Mark Zuckerberg might \u2014
p38
aVthe founder of Facebook and my boss \u2014
p39
aVasks all of us, which is, what  would I do if I wasn't afraid?
p40
aVAnd the answer to what would I do if I wasn't  afraid is I would get on the TED stage,
p41
aVand talk about women, and leadership.  And I did, and survived. (Applause)
p42
aa(lp43
VPM: I would say, not only survived.  I'm thinking of that moment, Sheryl,
p44
aVwhen you and I were standing backstage  together, and you turned to me,
p45
aVand you told me a story.
p46
aVAnd I said \u2014 very last minute \u2014 you know,  you really should share that story.
p47
aa(lp48
VSS: Oh, yeah. PM: What was that story?
p49
aa(lp50
VSS: Well, it's an important part of the  journey. So I had \u2014 TEDWomen \u2014
p51
aVthe original one was in D.C. \u2014 so I live here,  so I had gotten on a plane the day before,
p52
aVand my daughter was three, she was  clinging to my leg: "Mommy, don't go."
p53
aVAnd Pat's a friend, and so, not related  to the speech I was planning on giving,
p54
aVwhich was chock full of facts and  figures, and nothing personal,
p55
aVI told Pat the story. I said, well,  I'm having a hard day.
p56
aVYesterday my daughter was clinging  to my leg, and "Don't go."
p57
aa(lp58
VAnd you looked at me and said,  you have to tell that story.
p59
aVI said, on the TED stage? Are you kidding?
p60
aVI'm going to get on a stage and admit  my daughter was clinging to my leg?
p61
aVAnd you said yes, because if you want to talk  about getting more women into leadership roles,
p62
aVyou have to be honest about how hard it is.
p63
aVAnd I did. And I think that's a really  important part of the journey.
p64
aa(lp65
VThe same thing happened when I wrote my book.  I started writing the book. I wrote a first chapter,
p66
aVI thought it was fabulous. It was  chock-full of data and figures,
p67
aVI had three pages on matrilineal Maasai  tribes, and their sociological patterns.
p68
aVMy husband read it and he was like, this  is like eating your Wheaties. (Laughter)
p69
aVNo one \u2014 and I apologize to Wheaties if there's  someone \u2014 no one, no one will read this book.
p70
aVAnd I realized through the process that I  had to be more honest and more open,
p71
aVand I had to tell my stories. My stories of still  not feeling as self-confident as I should,
p72
aVin many situations. My first and  failed marriage. Crying at work.
p73
aVFelling like I didn't belong there,  feeling guilty to this day.
p74
aVAnd part of my journey, starting on this stage,  going to "Lean In," going to the foundation,
p75
aVis all about being more open and  honest about those challenges,
p76
aVso that other women can be more open and honest,
p77
aVand all of us can work together towards real equality.
p78
aa(lp79
VPM: I think that one of the most  striking parts about the book,
p80
aVand in my opinion, one of the reasons it's hit such  a nerve and is resonating around the world,
p81
aVis that you are personal in the book,  and that you do make it clear that,
p82
aVwhile you've observed some things that are  very important for other women to know,
p83
aVthat you've had the same challenges  that many others of us have,
p84
aVas you faced the hurdles and the barriers and  possibly the people who don't believe the same.
p85
aVSo talk about that process: deciding  you'd go public with the private part,
p86
aVand then you would also put yourself in  the position of something of an expert
p87
aVon how to resolve those challenges.
p88
aa(lp89
VSS: After I did the TED Talk, what happened was \u2014
p90
aVyou know, I never really expected to write  a book, I'm not an author, I'm not a writer,
p91
aVand it was viewed a lot, and it really  started impacting people's lives.
p92
aVI got this great \u2014- one of the first  letters I got was from a woman
p93
aVwho said that she was offered a really big  promotion at work, and she turned it down,
p94
aVand she told her best friend she turned  it down, and her best friend said,
p95
aVyou really need to watch this TED Talk.
p96
aVAnd so she watched this TED Talk, and she  went back the next day, she took the job,
p97
aVshe went home, and she handed her  husband the grocery list. (Laughter)
p98
aVAnd she said, I can do this.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd what really mattered to me \u2014 it wasn't  only women in the corporate world,
p101
aVeven though I did hear from a lot of  them, and it did impact a lot of them,
p102
aVit was also people of all different circumstances.
p103
aVThere was a doctor I met who was an  attending physician at Johns Hopkins,
p104
aVand he said that until he saw my TED  Talk, it never really occurred to him
p105
aVthat even though half the students in  his med school classes were women,
p106
aVthey weren't speaking as much as  the men as he did his rounds.
p107
aVSo he started paying attention, and as he waited for  raised hands, he realized the men's hands were up.
p108
aVSo he started encouraging the  women to raise their hands more,
p109
aVand it still didn't work.
p110
aVSo he told everyone, no more  hand raising, I'm cold-calling.
p111
aVSo he could call evenly on men and women.  And what he proved to himself was that
p112
aVthe women knew the answers just as well or better,
p113
aVand he was able to go back  to them and tell them that.
p114
aVAnd then there was the woman, stay-at-home  mom, lives in a really difficult neighborhood,
p115
aVwith not a great school, she said that TED  Talk \u2014 she's never had a corporate job,
p116
aVbut that TED Talk inspired her to go to her school  and fight for a better teacher for her child.
p117
aVAnd I guess it was part of was finding my own voice.
p118
aVAnd I realized that other women and  men could find their voice through it,
p119
aVwhich is why I went from the talk to the book.
p120
aa(lp121
VPM: And in the book, you not only found your  voice, which is clear and strong in the book,
p122
aVbut you also share what you've learned \u2014
p123
aVthe experiences of other people in the lessons.
p124
aVAnd that's what I'm thinking about  in terms of putting yourself in a \u2014
p125
aVyou became a sort of expert in how you lean in.
p126
aVSo what did that feel like, and  become like in your life?
p127
aVTo launch not just a book, not just  a best-selling, best-viewed talk,
p128
aVbut a movement, where people began to  literally describe their actions at work as,
p129
aVI'm leaning in.
p130
aa(lp131
VSS: I mean, I'm grateful, I'm honored,  I'm happy, and it's the very beginning.
p132
aVSo I don't know if I'm an expert, or if anyone is  an expert. I certainly have done a lot of research.
p133
aVI have read every study, I have  pored over the materials,
p134
aVand the lessons are very clear.  Because here's what we know:
p135
aVWhat we know is that stereotypes are holding women  back from leadership roles all over the world.
p136
aVIt's so striking. "Lean In" is very global,  I've been all over the world,
p137
aVtalking about it, and \u2014 cultures are so different.
p138
aVEven within our own country, to Japan,  to Korea, to China, to Asia, Europe,
p139
aVthey're so different. Except for one thing: gender.
p140
aVAll over the world, no matter what our cultures are,
p141
aVwe think men should be strong,  assertive, aggressive, have voice;
p142
aVwe think women should speak  when spoken to, help others.
p143
aa(lp144
VNow we have, all over the world,
p145
aVwomen are called "bossy."  There is a word for "bossy,"
p146
aVfor little girls, in every language there's one.
p147
aVIt's a word that's pretty much not used for little boys,
p148
aVbecause if a little boy leads,  there's no negative word for it,
p149
aVit's expected. But if a little girl leads, she's bossy.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow I know there aren't a lot of  men here, but bear with me.
p152
aVIf you're a man, you'll have  to represent your gender.
p153
aVPlease raise your hand if you've been  told you're too aggressive at work.
p154
aV(Laughter) There's always a few, it runs about  five percent. Okay, get ready, gentlemen.
p155
aVIf you're a woman, please raise your hand if you've  ever been told you're too aggressive at work.
p156
aV(Laughter) That is what audiences have  said in every country in the world,
p157
aVand it's deeply supported by the data.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow, do we think women are more  aggressive than men? Of course not.
p160
aVIt's just that we judge them through a different lens,
p161
aVand a lot of the character traits that you must  exhibit to perform at work, to get results, to lead,
p162
aVare ones that we think, in a man, he's a boss,
p163
aVand in a woman, she's bossy.
p164
aVAnd the good news about this is that we  can change this by acknowledging it.
p165
aa(lp166
VOne of the happiest moments  I had in this whole journey is,
p167
aVafter the book came out, I stood on a stage  with John Chambers, the CEO of Cisco.
p168
aVHe read the book. He stood on a stage with me, he  invited me in front of his whole management team,
p169
aVmen and women, and he said, I thought we  were good at this. I thought I was good at this.
p170
aVAnd then I read this book, and I  realized that we \u2014 my company \u2014
p171
aVwe have called all of our  senior women too aggressive,
p172
aVand I'm standing on this stage, and I'm sorry.
p173
aVAnd I want you to know we're  never going to do it again.
p174
aa(lp175
VPM: Can we send that to a lot of other  people that we know? (Applause)
p176
aa(lp177
VSS: And so John is doing that because  he believes it's good for his company,
p178
aVand so this kind of acknowledgement  of these biases can change it.
p179
aVAnd so next time you all see  someone call a little girl "bossy,"
p180
aVyou walk right up to that person,  big smile, and you say,
p181
aV"That little girl's not bossy. That little girl has  executive leadership skills." (Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VPM: I know that's what you're telling your daughter.  SS: Absolutely.
p184
aa(lp185
VPM: And you did focus in the book \u2014 and  the reason, as you said, in writing it,
p186
aVwas to create a dialogue about this.
p187
aVI mean, let's just put it out there,  face the fact that women are \u2014
p188
aVin a time when we have more open  doors, and more opportunities \u2014
p189
aVare still not getting to the leadership positions.
p190
aVSo in the months that have come since the book,
p191
aVin which "Lean In" focused on that and said,
p192
aVhere are some of the challenges that remain, and  many of them we have to own within ourselves
p193
aVand look at ourselves. What has changed?
p194
aVHave you seen changes?
p195
aa(lp196
VSS: Well, there's certainly more  dialogue, which is great.
p197
aVBut what really matters to me,  and I think all of us, is action.
p198
aVSo everywhere I go, CEOs,  they're mostly men, say to me,
p199
aVyou're costing me so much money
p200
aVbecause all the women want to  be paid as much as the men.
p201
aVAnd to them I say, I'm not sorry at all. (Laughter)
p202
aVAt all. I mean, the women should  be paid as much as the men.
p203
aa(lp204
VEverywhere I go, women tell me they ask for raises.
p205
aVEverywhere I go, women say they're getting  better relationships with their spouses,
p206
aVasking for more help at home, asking for the  promotions they should be getting at work,
p207
aVand importantly, believing it  themselves. Even little things.
p208
aVOne of the governors of one of the states told me  that he didn't realize that more women were, in fact,
p209
aVliterally sitting on the side  of the room, which they are,
p210
aVand now he made a rule that all the women  on his staff need to sit at the table.
p211
aa(lp212
VThe foundation I started along  with the book "Lean In"
p213
aVhelps women, or men, start circles \u2014 small groups,
p214
aVit can be 10, it can be however many  you want, which meet once a month.
p215
aVI would have hoped that by now, we'd have  about 500 circles. That would've been great.
p216
aVYou know, 500 times roughly 10.
p217
aVThere are over 12,000 circles  in 50 countries in the world.
p218
aa(lp219
VPM: Wow, that's amazing.
p220
aa(lp221
VSS: And these are people who  are meeting every single month.
p222
aVI met one of them, I was in Beijing.
p223
aVA group of women, they're all about 29 or 30,  they started the first Lean In circle in Beijing,
p224
aVseveral of them grew up in very poor, rural China.
p225
aVThese women are 29, they are told by  their society that they are "left over,"
p226
aVbecause they are not yet married,
p227
aVand the process of coming together  once a month at a meeting
p228
aVis helping them define who they are for themselves.
p229
aVWhat they want in their careers. The  kind of partners they want, if at all.
p230
aVI looked at them, we went around  and introduced ourselves,
p231
aVand they all said their names  and where they're from,
p232
aVand I said, I'm Sheryl Sandberg,  and this was my dream.
p233
aVAnd I kind of just started crying.
p234
aVRight, which, I admit, I do. Right?  I've talked about it before.
p235
aVBut the fact that a woman so far away out in  the world, who grew up in a rural village,
p236
aVwho's being told to marry someone  she doesn't want to marry,
p237
aVcan now go meet once a month with  a group of people and refuse that,
p238
aVand find life on her own terms.
p239
aVThat's the kind of change we have to hope for.
p240
aa(lp241
VPM: Have you been surprised by  the global nature of the message?
p242
aVBecause I think when the book first  came out, many people thought,
p243
aVwell, this is a really important handbook  for young women on their way up.
p244
aVThey need to look at this, anticipate  the barriers, and recognize them,
p245
aVput them out in the open, have the dialogue about it,
p246
aVbut that it's really for women who are that.  Doing that. Pursuing the corporate world.
p247
aVAnd yet the book is being read, as you  say, in rural and developing countries.
p248
aVWhat part of that has surprised you, and  perhaps led to a new perspective on your part?
p249
aa(lp250
VSS: The book is about self-confidence,  and about equality.
p251
aVAnd it turns out, everywhere in the world,  women need more self-confidence,
p252
aVbecause the world tells us we're not equal to men.
p253
aVEverywhere in the world, we live in  a world where the men get "and,"
p254
aVand women get "or."
p255
aVI've never met a man who's been  asked how he does it all. (Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
VAgain, I'm going to turn to the men in the audience:
p258
aVPlease raise your hand if you've  been asked, how do you do it all?
p259
aV(Laughter)
p260
aVMen only.
p261
aVWomen, women. Please raise your hand  if you've been asked how you do it all?
p262
aVWe assume men can do it all,  slash \u2014 have jobs and children.
p263
aVWe assume women can't, and that's ridiculous,
p264
aVbecause the great majority of women everywhere  in the world, including the United States,
p265
aVwork full time and have children.
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd I think people don't fully understand  how broad the message is.
p268
aVThere is a circle that's been started  for rescued sex workers in Miami.
p269
aVThey're using "Lean In" to help  people make the transition
p270
aVback to what would be a fair life, really rescuing  them from their pimps, and using it.
p271
aVThere are dress-for-success groups  in Texas which are using the book,
p272
aVfor women who have never been to college.
p273
aVAnd we know there are groups  all the way to Ethiopia.
p274
aVAnd so these messages of equality \u2014 of how women  are told they can't have what men can have \u2014
p275
aVhow we assume that leadership is for men,  how we assume that voice is for men,
p276
aVthese affect all of us, and I  think they are very universal.
p277
aVAnd it's part of what TEDWomen does.
p278
aVIt unites all of us in a cause we have to believe in,
p279
aVwhich is more women, more voice, more equality.
p280
aa(lp281
VPM: If you were invited now to  make another TEDWomen talk,
p282
aVwhat would you say that is a result  of this experience, for you personally,
p283
aVand what you've learned about women, and men,
p284
aVas you've made this journey?
p285
aa(lp286
VSS: I think I would say \u2014 I tried to say this strongly,
p287
aVbut I think I can say it more strongly \u2014
p288
aVI want to say that the status quo is not enough.
p289
aVThat it's not good enough, that it's  not changing quickly enough.
p290
aVSince I gave my TED Talk and published my book,  another year of data came out from the U.S. Census.
p291
aVAnd you know what we found?
p292
aVNo movement in the wage gap  for women in the United States.
p293
aVSeventy-seven cents to the dollar.
p294
aVIf you are a black woman, 64 cents.
p295
aVIf you are a Latina, we're at 54 cents.
p296
aVDo you know when the last  time those numbers went up?
p297
aV2002.
p298
aVWe are stagnating, we are  stagnating in so many ways.
p299
aVAnd I think we are not really being honest about that,
p300
aVfor so many reasons. It's so  hard to talk about gender.
p301
aVWe shy away from the word "feminist,"  a word I really think we need to embrace.
p302
aVWe have to get rid of the  word bossy and bring back \u2014
p303
aV(Applause)
p304
aVI think I would say in a louder voice,  we need to get rid of the word "bossy"
p305
aVand bring back the word "feminist,"  because we need it.
p306
aV(Applause)
p307
aa(lp308
VPM: And we all need to do a lot more leaning in.
p309
aa(lp310
VSS: A lot more leaning in.
p311
aa(lp312
VPM: Thank you, Sheryl.
p313
aVThanks for leaning in and saying yes.
