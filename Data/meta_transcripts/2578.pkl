VTwelve years ago, I picked up a camera for the first time
p4
aVto film the olive harvest in a Palestinian village in the West Bank.
p5
aVI thought I was there to make a single documentary
p6
aVand would then move on to some other part of the world.
p7
aVBut something kept bringing me back.
p8
aa(lp9
VNow, usually, when international audiences hear about that part of the world,
p10
aVthey often just want that conflict to go away.
p11
aVThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict is bad, and we wish it could just disappear.
p12
aVWe feel much the same way about other conflicts around the world.
p13
aVBut every time we turn our attention to the news,
p14
aVit seems like one more country has gone up in flames.
p15
aVSo I've been wondering
p16
aVwhether we should not start looking at conflict in a different way \u2014
p17
aVwhether instead of simply wishing to end conflict,
p18
aVwe focus instead on how to wage conflict.
p19
aVThis has been a big question for me,
p20
aVone I've pursued together with my team at the nonprofit Just Vision.
p21
aVAfter witnessing several different kinds of struggles in the Middle East,
p22
aVI started noticing some patterns on the more successful ones.
p23
aVI wondered whether these variables held across cases, and if they did,
p24
aVwhat lessons we could glean for waging constructive conflict,
p25
aVin Palestine, Israel and elsewhere.
p26
aa(lp27
VThere is some science about this.
p28
aVIn a study of 323 major political conflicts
p29
aVfrom 1900 to 2006,
p30
aVMaria Stephan and Erica Chenoweth found that nonviolent campaigns
p31
aVwere almost 100 percent more likely to lead to success than violent campaigns.
p32
aVNonviolent campaigns are also less likely to cause physical harm
p33
aVto those waging the campaign,
p34
aVas well as their opponents.
p35
aVAnd, critically, they typically lead to more peaceful and democratic societies.
p36
aVIn other words, nonviolent resistance is a more effective and constructive way
p37
aVof waging conflict.
p38
aa(lp39
VBut if that's such an easy choice, why don't more groups use it?
p40
aVPolitical scientist Victor Asal and colleagues
p41
aVhave looked at several factors
p42
aVthat shape a political group's choice of tactics.
p43
aVAnd it turns out that the greatest predictor
p44
aVof a movement's decision to adopt nonviolence or violence
p45
aVis not whether that group is more left-wing or right-wing,
p46
aVnot whether the group is more or less influenced by religious beliefs,
p47
aVnot whether it's up against a democracy or a dictatorship,
p48
aVand not even the levels of repression that that group is facing.
p49
aVThe greatest predictor of a movement's decision to adopt nonviolence
p50
aVis its ideology regarding the role of women in public life.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Applause)
p53
aa(lp54
VWhen a movement includes in its discourse
p55
aVlanguage around gender equality,
p56
aVit increases dramatically the chances it will adopt nonviolence,
p57
aVand thus, the likelihood it will succeed.
p58
aa(lp59
VThe research squared up with my own documentation
p60
aVof political organizing in Israel and Palestine.
p61
aVI've noticed that movements which welcome women into leadership positions,
p62
aVsuch as the one I documented in a village called Budrus,
p63
aVwere much more likely to achieve their goals.
p64
aVThis village was under a real threat of being wiped off the map
p65
aVwhen Israel started building the separation barrier.
p66
aVThe proposed route would require
p67
aVthe destruction of this community's olive groves, their cemeteries
p68
aVand would ultimately enclose the village from all sides.
p69
aVThrough inspired local leadership,
p70
aVthey launched a nonviolent resistance campaign to stop that from happening.
p71
aVThe odds were massively stacked against them.
p72
aVBut they had a secret weapon:
p73
aVa 15-year-old girl
p74
aVwho courageously jumped in front of a bulldozer
p75
aVwhich was about to uproot an olive tree, stopping it.
p76
aVIn that moment, the community of Budrus realized what was possible
p77
aVif they welcomed and encouraged women to participate in public life.
p78
aVAnd so it was that the women of Budrus went to the front lines day after day,
p79
aVusing their creativity and acumen to overcome multiple obstacles they faced
p80
aVin a 10-month unarmed struggle.
p81
aVAnd as you can probably tell at this point,
p82
aVthey win at the end.
p83
aa(lp84
VThe separation barrier was changed completely
p85
aVto the internationally recognized green line,
p86
aVand the women of Budrus came to be known across the West Bank
p87
aVfor their indomitable energy.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Applause)
p90
aa(lp91
VThank you.
p92
aa(lp93
VI want to pause for a second, which you helped me do,
p94
aVbecause I do want to tackle two very serious misunderstandings
p95
aVthat could happen at this point.
p96
aVThe first one is that I don't believe
p97
aVwomen are inherently or essentially more peaceful than men.
p98
aVBut I do believe that in today's world,
p99
aVwomen experience power differently.
p100
aVHaving had to navigate being in the less powerful position
p101
aVin multiple aspects of their lives,
p102
aVwomen are often more adept
p103
aVat how to surreptitiously pressure for change
p104
aVagainst large, powerful actors.
p105
aVThe term "manipulative," often charged against women in a derogatory way,
p106
aVreflects a reality in which women have often had to find ways
p107
aVother than direct confrontation to achieve their goals.
p108
aVAnd finding alternatives to direct confrontation
p109
aVis at the core of nonviolent resistance.
p110
aa(lp111
VNow to the second potential misunderstanding.
p112
aVI've been talking a lot about my experiences in the Middle East,
p113
aVand some of you might be thinking now
p114
aVthat the solution then is for us to educate Muslim and Arab societies
p115
aVto be more inclusive of their women.
p116
aVIf we were to do that, they would be more successful.
p117
aVThey do not need this kind of help.
p118
aVWomen have been part of the most influential movements
p119
aVcoming out of the Middle East,
p120
aVbut they tend to be invisible to the international community.
p121
aVOur cameras are largely focused on the men
p122
aVwho often end up involved in the more confrontational scenes
p123
aVthat we find so irresistible in our news cycle.
p124
aVAnd we end up with a narrative that not only erases women
p125
aVfrom the struggles in the region
p126
aVbut often misrepresents the struggles themselves.
p127
aa(lp128
VIn the late 1980s, an uprising started in Gaza,
p129
aVand quickly spread to the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
p130
aVIt came to be known as the First Intifada,
p131
aVand people who have any visual memory of it
p132
aVgenerally conjure up something like this:
p133
aVPalestinian men throwing rocks at Israeli tanks.
p134
aVThe news coverage at the time
p135
aVmade it seem like stones, Molotov cocktails and burning tires
p136
aVwere the only activities taking place in the Intifada.
p137
aVThis period, though, was also marked by widespread nonviolent organizing
p138
aVin the forms of strikes, sit-ins and the creation of parallel institutions.
p139
aa(lp140
VDuring the First Intifada,
p141
aVwhole sectors of the Palestinian civilian population mobilized,
p142
aVcutting across generations, factions and class lines.
p143
aVThey did this through networks of popular committees,
p144
aVand their use of direct action and communal self-help projects
p145
aVchallenged Israel's very ability
p146
aVto continue ruling the West Bank and Gaza.
p147
aVAccording to the Israeli Army itself,
p148
aV97 percent of activities during the First Intifada were unarmed.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd here's another thing that is not part of our narrative about that time.
p151
aVFor 18 months in the Intifada,
p152
aVwomen were the ones calling the shots behind the scenes:
p153
aVPalestinian women from all walks of life
p154
aVin charge of mobilizing hundreds of thousands of people
p155
aVin a concerted effort to withdraw consent from the occupation.
p156
aVNaela Ayesh, who strived to build a self-sufficient Palestinian economy
p157
aVby encouraging women in Gaza to grow vegetables in their backyards,
p158
aVan activity deemed illegal by the Israeli authorities at that time;
p159
aVRabeha Diab, who took over decision-making authority
p160
aVfor the entire uprising
p161
aVwhen the men who had been running it
p162
aVwere deported;
p163
aVFatima Al Jaafari, who swallowed leaflets containing the uprising's directives
p164
aVin order to spread them across the territories
p165
aVwithout getting caught;
p166
aVand Zahira Kamal,
p167
aVwho ensured the longevity of the uprising
p168
aVby leading an organization
p169
aVthat went from 25 women to 3,000 in a single year.
p170
aVDespite their extraordinary achievements,
p171
aVnone of these women have made it into our narrative of the First Intifada.
p172
aa(lp173
VWe do this in other parts of the globe, too.
p174
aVIn our history books, for instance, and in our collective consciousness,
p175
aVmen are the public faces and spokespersons
p176
aVfor the 1960s struggle for racial justice in the United States.
p177
aVBut women were also a critical driving force,
p178
aVmobilizing, organizing, taking to the streets.
p179
aVHow many of us think of Septima Clark
p180
aVwhen we think of the United States Civil Rights era?
p181
aVRemarkably few.
p182
aVBut she played a crucial role in every phase of the struggle,
p183
aVparticularly by emphasizing literacy and education.
p184
aVShe's been omitted, ignored,
p185
aVlike so many other women who played critical roles
p186
aVin the United States Civil Rights Movement.
p187
aa(lp188
VThis is not about getting credit.
p189
aVIt's more profound than that.
p190
aVThe stories we tell matter deeply to how we see ourselves,
p191
aVand to how we believe movements are run
p192
aVand how movements are won.
p193
aVThe stories we tell about a movement like the First Intifada
p194
aVor the United States Civil Rights era
p195
aVmatter deeply and have a critical influence
p196
aVin the choices Palestinians,
p197
aVAmericans
p198
aVand people around the world will make
p199
aVnext time they encounter an injustice
p200
aVand develop the courage to confront it.
p201
aVIf we do not lift up the women who played critical roles in these struggles,
p202
aVwe fail to offer up role models to future generations.
p203
aVWithout role models, it becomes harder
p204
aVfor women to take up their rightful space
p205
aVin public life.
p206
aVAnd as we saw earlier,
p207
aVone of the most critical variables
p208
aVin determining whether a movement will be successful or not
p209
aVis a movement's ideology regarding the role of women
p210
aVin public life.
p211
aa(lp212
VThis is a question of whether we're moving
p213
aVtowards more democratic and peaceful societies.
p214
aVIn a world where so much change is happening,
p215
aVand where change is bound to continue at an increasingly faster pace,
p216
aVit is not a question of whether we will face conflict,
p217
aVbut rather a question
p218
aVof which stories will shape
p219
aVhow we choose to wage conflict.
