(lp3
VSo I would like to start by telling you about one of my greatest friends,
p4
aVOkoloma Maduewesi.
p5
aVOkoloma lived on my street
p6
aVand looked after me like a big brother.
p7
aVIf I liked a boy, I would ask Okoloma's opinion.
p8
aVOkoloma died in the notorious Sosoliso plane crash
p9
aVin Nigeria in December of 2005.
p10
aVAlmost exactly seven years ago.
p11
aVOkoloma was a person I could argue with, laugh with and truly talk to.
p12
aVHe was also the first person to call me a feminist.
p13
aa(lp14
VI was about fourteen, we were at his house, arguing.
p15
aVBoth of us bristling with half bit knowledge
p16
aVfrom books that we had read.
p17
aVI don't remember what this particular argument was about,
p18
aVbut I remember that as I argued and argued,
p19
aVOkoloma looked at me and said, "You know, you're a feminist."
p20
aVIt was not a compliment.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VI could tell from his tone,
p25
aVthe same tone that you would use to say something like,
p26
aV"You're a supporter of terrorism."
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VI did not know exactly what this word "feminist" meant,
p31
aVand I did not want Okoloma to know that I did not know.
p32
aVSo I brushed it aside, and I continued to argue.
p33
aVAnd the first thing I planned to do when I got home
p34
aVwas to look up the word "feminist" in the dictionary.
p35
aa(lp36
VNow fast forward to some years later,
p37
aVI wrote a novel about a man who among other things beats his wife
p38
aVand whose story doesn't end very well.
p39
aVWhile I was promoting the novel in Nigeria,
p40
aVa journalist, a nice, well-meaning man,
p41
aVtold me he wanted to advise me.
p42
aVAnd for the Nigerians here,
p43
aVI'm sure we're all familiar
p44
aVwith how quick our people are to give unsolicited advice.
p45
aVHe told me that people were saying that my novel was feminist
p46
aVand his advice to me \u2014
p47
aVand he was shaking his head sadly as he spoke \u2014
p48
aVwas that I should never call myself a feminist
p49
aVbecause feminists are women who are unhappy
p50
aVbecause they cannot find husbands.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VSo I decided to call myself "a happy feminist."
p55
aVThen an academic, a Nigerian woman told me
p56
aVthat feminism was not our culture
p57
aVand that feminism wasn't African,
p58
aVand that I was calling myself a feminist
p59
aVbecause I had been corrupted by "Western books."
p60
aVWhich amused me,
p61
aVbecause a lot of my early readings were decidedly unfeminist.
p62
aVI think I must have read every single Mills & Boon romance published
p63
aVbefore I was sixteen.
p64
aVAnd each time I tried to read those books
p65
aVcalled "the feminist classics,"
p66
aVI'd get bored, and I really struggled to finish them.
p67
aVBut anyway, since feminism was un-African,
p68
aVI decided that I would now call myself "a happy African feminist."
p69
aVAt some point I was a happy African feminist who does not hate men
p70
aVand who likes lip gloss
p71
aVand who wears high heels for herself but not for men.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VOf course a lot of this was tongue-in-cheek,
p76
aVbut that word feminist is so heavy with baggage, negative baggage.
p77
aVYou hate men, you hate bras,
p78
aVyou hate African culture, that sort of thing.
p79
aa(lp80
VNow here's a story from my childhood.
p81
aVWhen I was in primary school,
p82
aVmy teacher said at the beginning of term that she would give the class a test
p83
aVand whoever got the highest score would be the class monitor.
p84
aVNow, class monitor was a big deal.
p85
aVIf you were a class monitor,
p86
aVyou got to write down the names of noisemakers \u2014
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
Vwhich was having enough power of its own.
p91
aVBut my teacher would also give you a cane to hold in your hand
p92
aVwhile you walk around and patrol the class for noisemakers.
p93
aVNow, of course you were not actually allowed to use the cane.
p94
aVBut it was an exciting prospect for the nine-year-old me.
p95
aVI very much wanted to be the class monitor.
p96
aVAnd I got the highest score on the test.
p97
aVThen, to my surprise, my teacher said that the monitor had to be a boy.
p98
aVShe had forgotten to make that clear earlier
p99
aVbecause she assumed it was ... obvious.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VA boy had the second highest score on the test,
p104
aVand he would be monitor.
p105
aVNow, what was even more interesting about this
p106
aVis that the boy was a sweet, gentle soul
p107
aVwho had no interest in patrolling the class with the cane,
p108
aVwhile I was full of ambition to do so.
p109
aVBut I was female and he was male,
p110
aVand so he became the class monitor.
p111
aVAnd I've never forgotten that incident.
p112
aa(lp113
VI often make the mistake of thinking
p114
aVthat something that is obvious to me is just as obvious to everyone else.
p115
aVNow, take my dear friend Louis
p116
aVfor example.
p117
aVLouis is a brilliant, progressive man,
p118
aVand we would have conversations and he would tell me,
p119
aV"I don't know what you mean by things being different or harder for women.
p120
aVMaybe in the past, but not now."
p121
aVAnd I didn't understand how Louis could not see what seems so self-evident.
p122
aVThen one evening, in Lagos, Louis and I went out with friends.
p123
aVAnd for people here who are not familiar with Lagos,
p124
aVthere's that wonderful Lagos' fixture,
p125
aVthe sprinkling of energetic men who hang around outside establishments
p126
aVand very dramatically "help" you park your car.
p127
aVI was impressed with the particular theatrics
p128
aVof the man who found us a parking spot that evening.
p129
aVAnd so as we were leaving, I decided to leave him a tip.
p130
aVI opened my bag,
p131
aVput my hand inside my bag,
p132
aVbrought out my money that I had earned from doing my work,
p133
aVand I gave it to the man.
p134
aVAnd he, this man who was very grateful and very happy,
p135
aVtook the money from me,
p136
aVlooked across at Louis
p137
aVand said, "Thank you, sir!"
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VLouis looked at me, surprised,
p142
aVand asked, "Why is he thanking me? I didn't give him the money."
p143
aVThen I saw realization dawn on Louis' face.
p144
aVThe man believed that whatever money I had
p145
aVhad ultimately come from Louis.
p146
aVBecause Louis is a man.
p147
aa(lp148
VMen and women are different.
p149
aVWe have different hormones, we have different sexual organs,
p150
aVwe have different biological abilities.
p151
aVWomen can have babies, men can't.
p152
aVAt least not yet.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VMen have testosterone and are in general physically stronger than women.
p157
aVThere's slightly more women than men in the world,
p158
aVabout 52 percent of the world's population is female.
p159
aVBut most of the positions of power and prestige are occupied by men.
p160
aVThe late Kenyan Nobel Peace laureate,
p161
aVWangari Maathai,
p162
aVput it simply and well when she said:
p163
aV"The higher you go, the fewer women there are."
p164
aVIn the recent US elections we kept hearing of the Lilly Ledbetter law,
p165
aVand if we go beyond the nicely alliterative name of that law,
p166
aVit was really about a man and a woman
p167
aVdoing the same job, being equally qualified,
p168
aVand the man being paid more because he's a man.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo in the literal way, men rule the world,
p171
aVand this made sense a thousand years ago
p172
aVbecause human beings lived then in a world
p173
aVin which physical strength was the most important attribute for survival.
p174
aVThe physically stronger person was more likely to lead,
p175
aVand men, in general, are physically stronger.
p176
aVOf course there are many exceptions.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VBut today we live in a vastly different world.
p181
aVThe person more likely to lead is not the physically stronger person;
p182
aVit is the more creative person, the more intelligent person,
p183
aVthe more innovative person,
p184
aVand there are no hormones for those attributes.
p185
aVA man is as likely as a woman to be intelligent,
p186
aVto be creative, to be innovative.
p187
aVWe have evolved;
p188
aVbut it seems to me that our ideas of gender had not evolved.
p189
aa(lp190
VSome weeks ago, I walked into a lobby of one of the best Nigerian hotels.
p191
aVI thought about naming the hotel, but I thought I probably shouldn't.
p192
aVAnd a guard at the entrance stopped me and asked me annoying questions,
p193
aVbecause their automatic assumption is
p194
aVthat a Nigerian female walking into a hotel alone is a sex worker.
p195
aVAnd by the way,
p196
aVwhy do these hotels focus on the ostensible supply
p197
aVrather than the demand for sex workers?
p198
aVIn Lagos I cannot go alone into many "reputable" bars and clubs.
p199
aVThey just don't let you in if you're a woman alone,
p200
aVyou have to be accompanied by a man.
p201
aVEach time I walk into a Nigerian restaurant with a man,
p202
aVthe waiter greets the man and ignores me.
p203
aVThe waiters are products \u2014
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VAt this some women felt like, "Yes! I thought that!"
p208
aVThe waiters are products of a society
p209
aVthat has taught them that men are more important than women.
p210
aVAnd I know that waiters don't intend any harm.
p211
aVBut it's one thing to know intellectually and quite another to feel it emotionally.
p212
aVEach time they ignore me, I feel invisible.
p213
aVI feel upset.
p214
aVI want to tell them that I am just as human as the man,
p215
aVthat I'm just as worthy of acknowledgment.
p216
aVThese are little things,
p217
aVbut sometimes it's the little things that sting the most.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd not long ago, I wrote an article
p220
aVabout what it means to be young and female in Lagos,
p221
aVand the printers told me,
p222
aV"It was so angry."
p223
aVOf course it was angry!
p224
aa(lp225
V(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VI am angry.
p228
aVGender as it functions today is a grave injustice.
p229
aVWe should all be angry.
p230
aVAnger has a long history of bringing about positive change;
p231
aVbut, in addition to being angry, I'm also hopeful.
p232
aVBecause I believe deeply in the ability of human beings
p233
aVto make and remake themselves for the better.
p234
aa(lp235
VGender matters everywhere in the world,
p236
aVbut I want to focus on Nigeria
p237
aVand on Africa in general,
p238
aVbecause it is where I know, and because it is where my heart is.
p239
aVAnd I would like today to ask
p240
aVthat we begin to dream about and plan for a different world,
p241
aVa fairer world,
p242
aVa world of happier men and happier women who are truer to themselves.
p243
aVAnd this is how to start:
p244
aVwe must raise our daughters differently.
p245
aVWe must also raise our sons differently.
p246
aVWe do a great disservice to boys on how we raise them;
p247
aVwe stifle the humanity of boys.
p248
aVWe define masculinity in a very narrow way,
p249
aVmasculinity becomes this hard, small cage
p250
aVand we put boys inside the cage.
p251
aVWe teach boys to be afraid of fear.
p252
aVWe teach boys to be afraid of weakness, of vulnerability.
p253
aVWe teach them to mask their true selves,
p254
aVbecause they have to be, in Nigerian speak, "hard man!"
p255
aVIn secondary school, a boy and a girl, both of them teenagers,
p256
aVboth of them with the same amount of pocket money, would go out
p257
aVand then the boy would be expected always to pay,
p258
aVto prove his masculinity.
p259
aVAnd yet we wonder why boys are more likely to steal money from their parents.
p260
aa(lp261
VWhat if both boys and girls were raised
p262
aVnot to link masculinity with money?
p263
aVWhat if the attitude was not "the boy has to pay"
p264
aVbut rather "whoever has more should pay?"
p265
aVNow, of course because of that historical advantage,
p266
aVit is mostly men who will have more today,
p267
aVbut if we start raising children differently,
p268
aVthen in fifty years, in a hundred years,
p269
aVboys will no longer have the pressure of having to prove this masculinity.
p270
aVBut by far the worst thing we do to males,
p271
aVby making them feel that they have to be hard,
p272
aVis that we leave them with very fragile egos.
p273
aVThe more "hard man" the man feels compelled to be,
p274
aVthe weaker his ego is.
p275
aVAnd then we do a much greater disservice to girls
p276
aVbecause we raise them to cater to the fragile egos of men.
p277
aVWe teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller,
p278
aVwe say to girls,
p279
aV"You can have ambition, but not too much."
p280
aa(lp281
V(Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
V"You should aim to be successful, but not too successful,
p284
aVotherwise you would threaten the man."
p285
aVIf you are the breadwinner in your relationship with a man,
p286
aVyou have to pretend that you're not,
p287
aVespecially in public,
p288
aVotherwise you will emasculate him.
p289
aa(lp290
VBut what if we question the premise itself?
p291
aVWhy should a woman's success be a threat to a man?
p292
aVWhat if we decide to simply dispose of that word,
p293
aVand I don't think there's an English word I dislike more than "emasculation."
p294
aVA Nigerian acquaintance once asked me
p295
aVif I was worried that men would be intimidated by me.
p296
aVI was not worried at all.
p297
aVIn fact, it had not occurred to me to be worried
p298
aVbecause a man who would be intimidated by me
p299
aVis exactly the kind of man I would have no interest in.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Laughter)
p302
aa(lp303
V(Applause)
p304
aa(lp305
VBut still I was really struck by this.
p306
aVBecause I'm female, I'm expected to aspire to marriage;
p307
aVI'm expected to make my life choices
p308
aValways keeping in mind that marriage is the most important.
p309
aVA marriage can be a good thing;
p310
aVit can be a source of joy and love and mutual support.
p311
aVBut why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
p312
aVand we don't teach boys the same?
p313
aa(lp314
VI know a woman who decided to sell her house
p315
aVbecause she didn't want to intimidate a man who might marry her.
p316
aVI know an unmarried woman in Nigeria who, when she goes to conferences,
p317
aVwears a wedding ring
p318
aVbecause according to her,
p319
aVshe wants the other participants in the conference to "give her respect."
p320
aVI know young women who are under so much pressure
p321
aVfrom family, from friends, even from work to get married,
p322
aVand they're pushed to make terrible choices.
p323
aVA woman at a certain age who is unmarried,
p324
aVour society teaches her to see it as a deep, personal failure.
p325
aVAnd a man at a certain age who is unmarried,
p326
aVwe just think he hasn't come around to making his pick.
p327
aa(lp328
V(Laughter)
p329
aa(lp330
VIt's easy for us to say,
p331
aV"Oh, but women can just say no to all of this."
p332
aVBut the reality is more difficult and more complex.
p333
aVWe're all social beings.
p334
aVWe internalize ideas from our socialization.
p335
aVEven the language we use
p336
aVin talking about marriage and relationships illustrates this.
p337
aVThe language of marriage is often the language of ownership
p338
aVrather than the language of partnership.
p339
aVWe use the word "respect"
p340
aVto mean something a woman shows a man
p341
aVbut often not something a man shows a woman.
p342
aa(lp343
VBoth men and women in Nigeria will say \u2014
p344
aVthis is an expression I'm very amused by \u2014
p345
aV"I did it for peace in my marriage."
p346
aVNow, when men say it,
p347
aVit is usually about something that they should not be doing anyway.
p348
aa(lp349
V(Laughter)
p350
aa(lp351
VSometimes they say it to their friends,
p352
aVit's something to say to their friends in a kind of fondly exasperated way,
p353
aVyou know, something that ultimately proves how masculine they are,
p354
aVhow needed, how loved.
p355
aV"Oh, my wife said I can't go to the club every night,
p356
aVso for peace in my marriage, I do it only on weekends."
p357
aa(lp358
V(Laughter)
p359
aa(lp360
VNow, when a woman says, "I did it for peace in my marriage,"
p361
aVshe's usually talking about giving up a job,
p362
aVa dream,
p363
aVa career.
p364
aVWe teach females that in relationships,
p365
aVcompromise is what women do.
p366
aVWe raise girls to see each other as competitors \u2014
p367
aVnot for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing,
p368
aVbut for attention of men.
p369
aVWe teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings
p370
aVin the way that boys are.
p371
aVIf we have sons, we don't mind knowing about our sons' girlfriends.
p372
aVBut our daughters' boyfriends? God forbid.
p373
aa(lp374
V(Laughter)
p375
aa(lp376
VBut of course when the time is right,
p377
aVwe expect those girls to bring back the perfect man to be their husbands.
p378
aVWe police girls, we praise girls for virginity,
p379
aVbut we don't praise boys for virginity,
p380
aVand it's always made me wonder how exactly this is supposed to work out because ...
p381
aa(lp382
V(Laughter)
p383
aa(lp384
V(Applause)
p385
aa(lp386
VI mean, the loss of virginity is usually a process that involves ...
p387
aa(lp388
VRecently a young woman was gang raped in a university in Nigeria,
p389
aVI think some of us know about that.
p390
aVAnd the response of many young Nigerians, both male and female,
p391
aVwas something along the lines of this:
p392
aV"Yes, rape is wrong.
p393
aVBut what is a girl doing in a room with four boys?"
p394
aVNow, if we can forget the horrible inhumanity of that response,
p395
aVthese Nigerians have been raised to think of women as inherently guilty,
p396
aVand they have been raised to expect so little of men
p397
aVthat the idea of men as savage beings without any control
p398
aVis somehow acceptable.
p399
aVWe teach girls shame.
p400
aV"Close your legs." "Cover yourself."
p401
aVWe make them feel as though by being born female
p402
aVthey're already guilty of something.
p403
aVAnd so, girls grow up to be women
p404
aVwho cannot see they have desire.
p405
aVThey grow up to be women who silence themselves.
p406
aVThey grow up to be women who cannot say what they truly think,
p407
aVand they grow up \u2014
p408
aVand this is the worst thing we did to girls \u2014
p409
aVthey grow up to be women who have turned pretense into an art form.
p410
aa(lp411
V(Applause)
p412
aa(lp413
VI know a woman who hates domestic work,
p414
aVshe just hates it,
p415
aVbut she pretends that she likes it,
p416
aVbecause she's been taught that to be "good wife material"
p417
aVshe has to be \u2014 to use that Nigerian word \u2014
p418
aVvery "homely."
p419
aVAnd then she got married,
p420
aVand after a while her husband's family began to complain that she had changed.
p421
aa(lp422
V(Laughter)
p423
aa(lp424
VActually, she had not changed,
p425
aVshe just got tired of pretending.
p426
aa(lp427
VThe problem with gender,
p428
aVis that it prescribes how we should be
p429
aVrather than recognizing how we are.
p430
aa(lp431
VNow imagine how much happier we would be,
p432
aVhow much freer to be our true individual selves,
p433
aVif we didn't have the weight of gender expectations.
p434
aVBoys and girls are undeniably different biologically,
p435
aVbut socialization exaggerates the differences
p436
aVand then it becomes a self-fulfilling process.
p437
aVNow, take cooking for example.
p438
aVToday women in general are more likely to do the housework than men,
p439
aVthe cooking and cleaning.
p440
aVBut why is that?
p441
aVIs it because women are born with a cooking gene?
p442
aa(lp443
V(Laughter)
p444
aa(lp445
VOr because over years they have been socialized to see cooking as their role?
p446
aVActually, I was going to say that maybe women are born with a cooking gene,
p447
aVuntil I remember that the majority of the famous cooks in the world,
p448
aVwhom we give the fancy title of "chefs,"
p449
aVare men.
p450
aa(lp451
VI used to look up to my grandmother
p452
aVwho was a brilliant, brilliant woman,
p453
aVand wonder how she would have been
p454
aVif she had the same opportunities as men when she was growing up.
p455
aa(lp456
VNow today, there are many more opportunities for women
p457
aVthan there were during my grandmother's time
p458
aVbecause of changes in policy, changes in law,
p459
aVall of which are very important.
p460
aVBut what matters even more is our attitude, our mindset,
p461
aVwhat we believe and what we value about gender.
p462
aVWhat if in raising children
p463
aVwe focus on ability instead of gender?
p464
aVWhat if in raising children we focus on interest instead of gender?
p465
aa(lp466
VI know a family who have a son and a daughter,
p467
aVboth of whom are brilliant at school,
p468
aVwho are wonderful, lovely children.
p469
aVWhen the boy is hungry, the parents say to the girl,
p470
aV"Go and cook Indomie noodles for your brother."
p471
aa(lp472
V(Laughter)
p473
aa(lp474
VNow, the daughter doesn't particularly like to cook Indomie noodles,
p475
aVbut she's a girl, and so she has to.
p476
aVNow, what if the parents,
p477
aVfrom the beginning,
p478
aVtaught both the boy and the girl to cook Indomie?
p479
aVCooking, by the way, is a very useful skill for boys to have.
p480
aVI've never thought it made sense to leave such a crucial thing,
p481
aVthe ability to nourish oneself \u2014
p482
aa(lp483
V(Laughter)
p484
aa(lp485
Vin the hands of others.
p486
aa(lp487
V(Applause)
p488
aa(lp489
VI know a woman who has the same degree and the same job as her husband.
p490
aVWhen they get back from work, she does most of the housework,
p491
aVwhich I think is true for many marriages.
p492
aVBut what struck me about them
p493
aVwas that whenever her husband changed the baby's diaper,
p494
aVshe said "thank you" to him.
p495
aVNow, what if she saw this as perfectly normal and natural
p496
aVthat he should, in fact, care for his child?
p497
aa(lp498
V(Laughter)
p499
aa(lp500
VI'm trying to unlearn many of the lessons of gender
p501
aVthat I internalized when I was growing up.
p502
aVBut I sometimes still feel very vulnerable in the face of gender expectations.
p503
aVThe first time I taught a writing class in graduate school,
p504
aVI was worried.
p505
aVI wasn't worried about the material I would teach
p506
aVbecause I was well-prepared,
p507
aVand I was going to teach what I enjoy teaching.
p508
aVInstead, I was worried about what to wear.
p509
aVI wanted to be taken seriously.
p510
aVI knew that because I was female
p511
aVI will automatically have to prove my worth.
p512
aVAnd I was worried that if I looked too feminine,
p513
aVI would not be taken seriously.
p514
aVI really wanted to wear my shiny lip gloss and my girly skirt,
p515
aVbut I decided not to.
p516
aVInstead, I wore a very serious,
p517
aVvery manly and very ugly suit.
p518
aa(lp519
V(Laughter)
p520
aa(lp521
VBecause the sad truth is that when it comes to appearance
p522
aVwe start off with men as the standard, as the norm.
p523
aVIf a man is getting ready for a business meeting,
p524
aVhe doesn't worry about looking too masculine
p525
aVand therefore not being taken for granted.
p526
aVIf a woman has to get ready for business meeting,
p527
aVshe has to worry about looking too feminine
p528
aVand what it says and whether or not she will be taken seriously.
p529
aa(lp530
VI wish I had not worn that ugly suit that day.
p531
aVI've actually banished it from my closet, by the way.
p532
aVHad I then the confidence that I have now to be myself,
p533
aVmy students would have benefited even more from my teaching,
p534
aVbecause I would have been more comfortable
p535
aVand more fully and more truly myself.
p536
aVI have chosen to no longer be apologetic for my femaleness
p537
aVand for my femininity.
p538
aa(lp539
V(Applause)
p540
aa(lp541
VAnd I want to be respected in all of my femaleness
p542
aVbecause I deserve to be.
p543
aVGender is not an easy conversation to have.
p544
aVFor both men and women,
p545
aVto bring up gender is sometimes to encounter almost immediate resistance.
p546
aVI can imagine some people here are actually thinking,
p547
aV"Women too do sef."
p548
aVSome of the men here might be thinking,
p549
aV"OK, all of this is interesting,
p550
aVbut I don't think like that."
p551
aVAnd that is part of the problem.
p552
aa(lp553
VThat many men do not actively think about gender
p554
aVor notice gender
p555
aVis part of the problem of gender.
p556
aVThat many men, say, like my friend Louis,
p557
aVthat everything is fine now.
p558
aVAnd that many men do nothing to change it.
p559
aVIf you are a man and you walk into a restaurant with a woman
p560
aVand the waiter greets only you,
p561
aVdoes it occur to you to ask the waiter,
p562
aV"Why haven't you greeted her?"
p563
aVBecause gender can be \u2014
p564
aa(lp565
V(Laughter)
p566
aa(lp567
VActually, we may repose part of a longer version of this talk.
p568
aVSo, because gender can be a very uncomfortable conversation to have,
p569
aVthere are very easy ways to close it, to close the conversation.
p570
aVSo some people will bring up evolutionary biology and apes,
p571
aVhow, you know, female apes bow down to male apes
p572
aVand that sort of thing.
p573
aVBut the point is we're not apes.
p574
aa(lp575
V(Laughter)
p576
aa(lp577
V(Applause)
p578
aa(lp579
VApes also live on trees and have earthworms for breakfast,
p580
aVand we don't.
p581
aVSome people will say, "Well, poor men also have a hard time."
p582
aVAnd this is true.
p583
aVBut that is not what this \u2014
p584
aa(lp585
V(Laughter)
p586
aa(lp587
VBut this is not what this conversation is about.
p588
aVGender and class are different forms of oppression.
p589
aVI actually learned quite a bit about systems of oppression
p590
aVand how they can be blind to one another
p591
aVby talking to black men.
p592
aa(lp593
VI was once talking to a black man about gender
p594
aVand he said to me,
p595
aV"Why do you have to say 'my experience as a woman'?
p596
aVWhy can't it be
p597
aV'your experience as a human being'?"
p598
aVNow, this was the same man
p599
aVwho would often talk about his experience as a black man.
p600
aa(lp601
VGender matters.
p602
aVMen and women experience the world differently.
p603
aVGender colors the way we experience the world.
p604
aVBut we can change that.
p605
aa(lp606
VSome people will say,
p607
aV"Oh, but women have the real power,
p608
aVbottom power."
p609
aVAnd for non-Nigerians, bottom power is an expression
p610
aVwhich I suppose means something like a woman
p611
aVwho uses her sexuality to get favors from men.
p612
aVBut bottom power is not power at all.
p613
aVBottom power means that a woman
p614
aVsimply has a good root to tap into, from time to time \u2014
p615
aVsomebody else's power.
p616
aVAnd then, of course, we have to wonder
p617
aVwhat happens when that somebody else is in a bad mood,
p618
aVor sick
p619
aVor impotent.
p620
aa(lp621
V(Laughter)
p622
aa(lp623
VSome people will say that a woman being subordinate to a man is our culture.
p624
aVBut culture is constantly changing.
p625
aVI have beautiful twin nieces who are fifteen and live in Lagos.
p626
aVIf they had been born a hundred years ago
p627
aVthey would have been taken away and killed.
p628
aVBecause it was our culture, it was our culture to kill twins.
p629
aa(lp630
VSo what is the point of culture?
p631
aVI mean there's the decorative,
p632
aVthe dancing ...
p633
aVbut also, culture really is about preservation and continuity of a people.
p634
aVIn my family,
p635
aVI am the child who is most interested in the story of who we are,
p636
aVin our traditions,
p637
aVin the knowledge about ancestral lands.
p638
aVMy brothers are not as interested as I am.
p639
aVBut I cannot participate,
p640
aVI cannot go to umunna meetings,
p641
aVI cannot have a say.
p642
aVBecause I'm female.
p643
aVCulture does not make people,
p644
aVpeople make culture.
p645
aVSo if it is in fact true \u2014
p646
aa(lp647
V(Applause)
p648
aa(lp649
VSo if it is in fact true
p650
aVthat the full humanity of women is not our culture,
p651
aVthen we must make it our culture.
p652
aa(lp653
VI think very often of my dear friend, Okoloma Maduewesi.
p654
aVMay he and all the others who passed away in that Sosoliso crash
p655
aVcontinue to rest in peace.
p656
aVHe will always be remembered by those of us who loved him.
p657
aVAnd he was right that day many years ago when he called me a feminist.
p658
aa(lp659
VI am a feminist.
p660
aVAnd when I looked up the word in the dictionary that day,
p661
aVthis is what it said:
p662
aV"Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political
p663
aVand economic equality of the sexes."
p664
aVMy great grandmother, from the stories I've heard,
p665
aVwas a feminist.
p666
aVShe ran away from the house of the man she did not want to marry
p667
aVand ended up marrying the man of her choice.
p668
aVShe refused, she protested, she spoke up
p669
aVwhenever she felt she was being deprived of access, of land, that sort of thing.
p670
aa(lp671
VMy great grandmother did not know that word "feminist,"
p672
aVbut it doesn't mean that she wasn't one.
p673
aVMore of us should reclaim that word.
p674
aVMy own definition of feminist is:
p675
aV"A feminist is a man or a woman
p676
aVwho says \u2014
p677
aa(lp678
V(Laughter)
p679
aa(lp680
V(Applause)
p681
aa(lp682
VA feminist is a man or a woman who says,
p683
aV"Yes, there's a problem with gender as it is today,
p684
aVand we must fix it.
p685
aVWe must do better."
p686
aVThe best feminist I know
p687
aVis my brother Kene.
p688
aVHe's also a kind, good-looking, lovely man,
p689
aVand he's very masculine.
p690
aa(lp691
VThank you.
