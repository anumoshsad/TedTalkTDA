VI love museums.
p4
aVHave you guys ever been to the Natural History Museum?
p5
aVIn New York City?
p6
aa(lp7
V(Applause)
p8
aa(lp9
VSo one of the things that I do is I take my kids to the museum.
p10
aVRecently I took them to the Natural History Museum.
p11
aVI had my two sons with me, Sabian and Dabith.
p12
aVAnd we go into the front entrance of the museum,
p13
aVand there's that amazing sculpture of Teddy Roosevelt out there.
p14
aVYou guys know which one I'm talking about.
p15
aVTeddy Roosevelt is sitting there with one hand on the horse,
p16
aVbold, strong, sleeves rolled up.
p17
aVI don't know if he's bare-chested, but it kind of feels like it.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd on the left-hand side of him is a Native American walking.
p22
aVAnd on the right-hand side of him is an African-American walking.
p23
aVAnd as we're moving up the stairs,
p24
aVgetting closer to the sculpture,
p25
aVmy oldest son, who's nine, says,
p26
aV"Dad, how come he gets to ride,
p27
aVand they have to walk?"
p28
aa(lp29
VIt stopped me in my tracks.
p30
aVIt stopped me in my tracks.
p31
aVThere was so much history
p32
aVthat we would have to go through to try to explain that,
p33
aVand that's something I try to do with them anyways.
p34
aVIt's a question that I probably would have never really asked.
p35
aVBut fundamentally what he was saying was,
p36
aV"That doesn't look fair.
p37
aVDad, that doesn't look fair.
p38
aVAnd why is this thing that's so not fair
p39
aVsitting outside of such an amazing institution."
p40
aVAnd his question got me wondering,
p41
aVis there a way for us to amend our public sculptures,
p42
aVour national monuments?
p43
aVNot erase them,
p44
aVbut is there a way to amend them?
p45
aa(lp46
VNow, I didn't grow up going to museums.
p47
aVThat's not my history.
p48
aVMy mother was 15 years old when I was born.
p49
aVShe is amazing.
p50
aVMy father was struggling with his own things
p51
aVfor most of my life.
p52
aVIf you really want to know the truth,
p53
aVthe only reason I got into art is because of a woman.
p54
aVThere was this amazing, amazing, fantastic, beautiful, smart woman,
p55
aVfour years older than me,
p56
aVand I wanted to go out with her.
p57
aVBut she said, "You're too young
p58
aVand you're not thinking about your future."
p59
aVSo I ran on down to the junior college,
p60
aVregistered for some classes,
p61
aVran on back,
p62
aVand basically was like, "I'm thinking about my future now."
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
V"Can we go out?"
p67
aa(lp68
VFor the record, she's even more amazing.
p69
aVI married her.
p70
aa(lp71
V(Applause)
p72
aa(lp73
VSo when I randomly ran down to the junior college
p74
aVand registered for classes,
p75
aVI really wasn't paying attention to what I was registering to.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VSo I ended up with an art history class,
p80
aVand I didn't know a thing about art history.
p81
aVBut something amazing happened when I went into that class.
p82
aVFor the first time in my academic career,
p83
aVmy visual intelligence was required of me.
p84
aVFor the first time.
p85
aVThe professor would put up an image,
p86
aVbold strokes of blues and yellows, and say, "Who's that?"
p87
aVAnd I'd go, "That's Van Gogh. Clearly that is Van Gogh.
p88
aVI got this."
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VI got a B in that class.
p93
aVFor me, that was amazing.
p94
aVIn high school, let's just say I wasn't a great student. OK?
p95
aVIn high school, my GPA was .65.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VDecimal point first, six five.
p100
aVSo me getting a B was huge, huge,
p101
aVabsolutely huge.
p102
aVAnd because of the fact that I realized that I was able to learn things visually
p103
aVthat I couldn't learn in other ways,
p104
aVthis became my strategy, this became my tactic
p105
aVfor understanding everything else.
p106
aVI wanted to stay in this relationship. Things were going well.
p107
aa(lp108
VI decided, let me keep taking these art history classes.
p109
aVOne of the last art history classes, I will not forget, I will never forget.
p110
aVIt was one of those survey art history classes.
p111
aVAnybody ever have one of those survey art history classes,
p112
aVwhere they try to teach you the entire history of art
p113
aVin a single semester?
p114
aVI'm talking about cave paintings and Jackson Pollock
p115
aVjust crunched together all in the same \u2014
p116
aVIt doesn't really work, but they try anyway.
p117
aVWell, at the beginning of the semester,
p118
aVI looked at the book,
p119
aVand in this 400-page book was about a 14-page section
p120
aVthat was on black people in painting.
p121
aVNow, this was a crammed in section
p122
aVthat had representations of black people in painting
p123
aVand black people who painted.
p124
aVIt was poorly curated, let's just put it that way.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VNonetheless I was really excited about it,
p129
aVbecause in all the other classes that I had,
p130
aVwe didn't even have that conversation.
p131
aVWe didn't talk about it at all.
p132
aVSo imagine my surprise
p133
aVwhen I get to class
p134
aVand on the day that we're supposed to go over that particular chapter,
p135
aVmy professor announces,
p136
aV"We're going to skip this chapter today
p137
aVbecause we do not have time to go through it."
p138
aa(lp139
V"Whoa, I'm sorry, hold on, professor, professor.
p140
aVI'm sorry. This is a really important chapter to me.
p141
aVAre we going to go over it at any point?"
p142
aa(lp143
V"Titus, we don't have time for this."
p144
aa(lp145
V"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
p146
aVplease, I really need to understand.
p147
aVClearly the author thinks that this is significant.
p148
aVWhy are we skipping over this?"
p149
aa(lp150
V"Titus, I do not have time for this."
p151
aa(lp152
V"OK, last question, I'm really sorry here.
p153
aVWhen can we talk, because we need to talk."
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VI went to her office hours.
p158
aVI ended up getting kicked out of her office.
p159
aVI went to the dean.
p160
aVThe dean finally told me, "I can't force her to teach anything."
p161
aVAnd I knew in that moment if I wanted to understand this history,
p162
aVif I wanted to understand the roles of those folks who had to walk,
p163
aVI was probably going to have to figure that out myself.
p164
aVSo ...
p165
aVabove you right here on the slide
p166
aVis a painting by Frans Hals.
p167
aVThis is one of the kinds of images
p168
aVthat was in that chapter.
p169
aVI taught myself how to paint
p170
aVby going to museums and looking at images like this.
p171
aa(lp172
VI want to show you something.
p173
aa(lp174
VI made this.
p175
aVI \u2014
p176
aa(lp177
V(Applause)
p178
aa(lp179
VI made some alterations.
p180
aVYou'll see there are some slight differences in the painting.
p181
aVAll this art history that I had been absorbing
p182
aVhelped me to realize that painting is a language.
p183
aVThere is a reason
p184
aVwhy he is the highest in the composition here.
p185
aVThere is a reason
p186
aVwhy the painter is showing us this gold necklace here.
p187
aVHe's trying to tell us something about the economic status
p188
aVof these people in these paintings.
p189
aVPainting is a visual language
p190
aVwhere everything in the painting
p191
aVis meaningful, is important.
p192
aVIt's coded.
p193
aVBut sometimes, because of the compositional structure,
p194
aVbecause of compositional hierarchy,
p195
aVit's hard to see other things.
p196
aVThis silk is supposed to tell us also that they have quite a bit of money.
p197
aVThere's more written
p198
aVabout dogs in art history
p199
aVthan there are about this other character here.
p200
aVHistorically speaking, in research on these kinds of paintings,
p201
aVI can find out more about the lace
p202
aVthat the woman is wearing in this painting \u2014
p203
aVthe manufacturer of the lace \u2014 than I can about this character here,
p204
aVabout his dreams, about his hopes,
p205
aVabout what he wanted out of life.
p206
aa(lp207
VI want to show you something.
p208
aVI don't want you to think
p209
aVthat this is about eradication.
p210
aVIt's not.
p211
aVThe oil that you saw me just put inside of this paint
p212
aVis linseed oil.
p213
aVIt becomes transparent over time,
p214
aVso eventually what's going to happen
p215
aVis these faces
p216
aVwill emerge a little bit.
p217
aVWhat I'm trying to do,
p218
aVwhat I'm trying to show you,
p219
aVis how to shift your gaze just slightly,
p220
aVjust momentarily,
p221
aVjust momentarily,
p222
aVto ask yourself the question,
p223
aVwhy do some have to walk?
p224
aVWhat is the impact of these kinds of sculptures at museums?
p225
aVWhat is the impact of these kinds of paintings
p226
aVon some of our most vulnerable in society,
p227
aVseeing these kinds of depictions of themselves all the time?
p228
aVI'm not saying erase it.
p229
aVWe can't erase this history.
p230
aVIt's real. We have to know it.
p231
aVI think of it in the same way
p232
aVwe think of \u2014
p233
aa(lp234
VLet me step back a second.
p235
aVYou remember old-school cameras,
p236
aVwhere when you took a picture, you actually had to focus. Right?
p237
aVYou'd put the camera up,
p238
aVand if I wanted you in focus,
p239
aVI would move the lens a little to the left
p240
aVand you would come forward.
p241
aVI could move the lens a little to the right,
p242
aVand you would go back and the folks in the background would come out.
p243
aVI'm just trying to do that here.
p244
aVI'm trying to give you that opportunity.
p245
aVI'm trying to answer that question
p246
aVthat my son had.
p247
aVI want to make paintings,
p248
aVI want to make sculptures
p249
aVthat are honest,
p250
aVthat wrestle with the struggles of our past
p251
aVbut speak to the diversity and the advances of our present.
p252
aVAnd we can't do that by taking an eraser and getting rid of stuff.
p253
aVThat's just not going to work.
p254
aVI think that we should do it in the same way
p255
aVthe American Constitution works.
p256
aVWhen we have a situation
p257
aVwhere we want to change a law in the American Constitution,
p258
aVwe don't erase the other one.
p259
aVAlongside that is an amendment,
p260
aVsomething that says,
p261
aV"This is where we were, but this is where we are right now."
p262
aVI figure if we can do that,
p263
aVthen that will help us understand a little bit
p264
aVabout where we're going.
p265
aa(lp266
VThank you.
