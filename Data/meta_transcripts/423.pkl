VIt's amazing, when you meet a head of state and you say,
p4
aV"What is your most precious natural resource?" \u2014
p5
aVthey will not say children at first.
p6
aVAnd then when you say children,
p7
aVthey will pretty quickly agree with you.

V(Video): We're traveling today with
p10
aVthe Minister of Defense of Colombia,
p11
aVhead of the army and the head of the police,
p12
aVand we're dropping off 650 laptops
p13
aVtoday to children
p14
aVwho have no television, no telephone
p15
aVand have been in a community
p16
aVcut off from the rest of the world
p17
aVfor the past 40 years.
p18
aa(lp19
VThe importance of delivering laptops to this region
p20
aVis connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected
p21
aVbecause of the FARC,
p22
aVthe guerrillas that started off 40 years ago
p23
aVas a political movement and then became a drug movement.
p24
aVThere are one billion children in the world,
p25
aVand 50 percent of them don't have electricity
p26
aVat home or at school.
p27
aVAnd in some countries \u2014 let me pick Afghanistan \u2014
p28
aV75 percent of the little girls don't go to school.
p29
aVAnd I don't mean that they drop out of school
p30
aVin the third or fourth grade \u2014 they don't go.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo in the three years
p33
aVsince I talked at TED and showed a prototype,
p34
aVit's gone from an idea
p35
aVto a real laptop.
p36
aVWe have half a million laptops today
p37
aVin the hands of children.
p38
aVWe have about a quarter of a million in transit
p39
aVto those and other children,
p40
aVand then there are another quarter of a million more
p41
aVthat are being ordered at this moment.
p42
aVSo, in rough numbers, there are a million laptops.
p43
aVThat's smaller than I predicted \u2014
p44
aVI predicted three to 10 million \u2014
p45
aVbut is still a very large number.
p46
aa(lp47
VIn Colombia, we have about 3,000 laptops.
p48
aVIt's the Minister of Defense with whom we're working,
p49
aVnot the Minister of Education, because it is seen as
p50
aVa strategic defense issue
p51
aVin the sense of liberating these zones
p52
aVthat had been completely closed off,
p53
aVin which the people who had been causing, if you will,
p54
aV40 years' worth of bombings and kidnappings
p55
aVand assassinations lived.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd suddenly,
p58
aVthe kids have connected laptops.
p59
aVThey've leapfrogged.
p60
aVThe change is absolutely monumental,
p61
aVbecause it's not just opening it up,
p62
aVbut it's opening it up to the rest of the world.
p63
aVSo yes, they're building roads, yes, they're putting in telephone,
p64
aVyes, there will be television.
p65
aVBut the kids six to 12 years old
p66
aVare surfing the Internet in Spanish and in local languages,
p67
aVso the children grow up
p68
aVwith access to information,
p69
aVwith a window into the rest of the world.
p70
aVBefore, they were closed off.
p71
aa(lp72
VInterestingly enough, in other countries,
p73
aVit will be the Minister of Finance who sees it
p74
aVas an engine of economic growth.
p75
aVAnd that engine is going to see the results in 20 years.
p76
aVIt's not going to happen, you know, in one year,
p77
aVbut it's an important, deeply economic
p78
aVand cultural change
p79
aVthat happens through children.
p80
aVThirty-one countries in total are involved,
p81
aVand in the case of Uruguay,
p82
aVhalf the children already have them,
p83
aVand by the middle of 2009,
p84
aVevery single child in Uruguay will have a laptop \u2014
p85
aVa little green laptop.
p86
aa(lp87
VNow what are some of the results?
p88
aVSome of the results
p89
aVthat go across every single country
p90
aVinclude teachers saying
p91
aVthey have never loved teaching so much,
p92
aVand reading comprehension
p93
aVmeasured by third parties \u2014 not by us \u2014 skyrockets.
p94
aVProbably the most important thing we see
p95
aVis children teaching parents.
p96
aVThey own the laptops. They take them home.
p97
aVAnd so when I met with three children from the schools,
p98
aVwho had traveled all day to come to Bogota,
p99
aVone of the three children brought her mother.
p100
aVAnd the reason she brought her mother
p101
aVis that this six-year-old child
p102
aVhad been teaching her mother
p103
aVhow to read and write.
p104
aVHer mother had not gone to primary school.
p105
aVAnd this is such an inversion,
p106
aVand such a wonderful example
p107
aVof children being the agents of change.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo now, in closing, people say,
p110
aVnow why laptops?
p111
aVLaptops are a luxury; it's like giving them iPods. No.
p112
aVThe reason you want laptops
p113
aVis that the word is education, not laptop.
p114
aVThis is an education project, not a laptop project.
p115
aVThey need to learn learning. And then, just think \u2014
p116
aVthey can have, let's say, 100 books.
p117
aVIn a village, you have 100 laptops,
p118
aVeach with a different set of 100 books,
p119
aVand so that village suddenly has 10,000 books.
p120
aVYou and I didn't have 10,000 books when we went to primary school.
p121
aa(lp122
VSometimes school is under a tree,
p123
aVor in many cases, the teacher has only a fifth-grade education,
p124
aVso you need a collaborative model of learning,
p125
aVnot just building more schools and training more teachers,
p126
aVwhich you have to do anyway.
p127
aVSo we're once again doing "Give One, Get One."
p128
aVLast year, we ran a "Give One, Get One" program,
p129
aVand it generated over 100,000 laptops
p130
aVthat we were then able to give free.
p131
aVAnd by being a zero-dollar laptop,
p132
aVwe can go to countries that can't afford it at all.
p133
aVAnd that's what we did. We went to Haiti,
p134
aVwe went to Rwanda, Afghanistan,
p135
aVEthiopia, Mongolia.
p136
aVPlaces that are not markets,
p137
aVseeding it with the principles of
p138
aVsaturation, connectivity, low ages, etc.
p139
aVAnd then we can actually roll out large numbers.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo think of it this way:
p142
aVthink of it as inoculating children
p143
aVagainst ignorance.
p144
aVAnd think of the laptop as a vaccine.
p145
aVYou don't vaccinate a few children.
p146
aVYou vaccinate all the children in an area.
