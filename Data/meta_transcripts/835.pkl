VGood morning.
p4
aVHappy to see so many fine folks out here
p5
aVand so many smiling faces.
p6
aVI have a very peculiar
p7
aVbackground, attitude and approach
p8
aVto the real world
p9
aVbecause I am a conjurer.
p10
aVNow, I prefer that term over magician,
p11
aVbecause if I were a magician, that would mean
p12
aVthat I use spells and incantations
p13
aVand weird gestures
p14
aVin order to accomplish real magic.
p15
aVNo, I don't do that; I'm a conjurer,
p16
aVwho is someone who pretends to be
p17
aVa real magician. (Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VNow, how do we go about that sort of thing?
p20
aVWe depend on the fact
p21
aVthat audiences, such as yourselves,
p22
aVwill make assumptions.
p23
aVFor example, when I walked up here
p24
aVand I took the microphone from the stand
p25
aVand switched it on,
p26
aVyou assumed this was a microphone, which it is not.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aVAs a matter of fact, this is something
p29
aVthat about half of you, more than half of you will not be familiar with.
p30
aVIt's a beard trimmer, you see?
p31
aVAnd it makes a very bad microphone;
p32
aVI've tried it many times. (Laughter)
p33
aVThe other assumption that you made \u2014
p34
aVand this little lesson is to show you
p35
aVthat you will make assumptions.
p36
aVNot only that you can, but that you will
p37
aVwhen they are properly suggested to you.
p38
aVYou believe I'm looking at you.
p39
aVWrong. I'm not looking at you. I can't see you.
p40
aVI know you're out there, they told me backstage, it's a full house and such.
p41
aVI know you're there because I can hear you,
p42
aVbut I can't see you because I normally wear glasses.
p43
aVThese are not glasses, these are empty frames. (Laughter)
p44
aVQuite empty frames.
p45
aa(lp46
VNow why would a grown man appear before you
p47
aVwearing empty frames on his face?
p48
aVTo fool you, ladies and gentlemen,
p49
aVto deceive you, to show that you, too,
p50
aVcan make assumptions.
p51
aVDon't you ever forget that.
p52
aVNow, I have to do something \u2014 first of all, switch to real glasses
p53
aVso I can actually see you,
p54
aVwhich would probably be a convenience. I don't know.
p55
aVI haven't had a good look. Well, it's not that great a convenience.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VI have to do something now, which seems
p60
aVa little bit strange for a magician.
p61
aVBut I'm going to take some medication.
p62
aVThis is a full bottle of
p63
aVCalms Forte.
p64
aVI'll explain that in just a moment.
p65
aVIgnore the instructions,
p66
aVthat's what the government has to put in there
p67
aVto confuse you, I'm sure.
p68
aVI will take enough of these. Mm.
p69
aVIndeed, the whole container.
p70
aVThirty-two tablets of Calms Forte.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow that I've done that \u2014 I'll explain it in a moment \u2014
p73
aVI must tell you that
p74
aVI am an actor.
p75
aVI'm an actor who plays a specific part.
p76
aVI play the part of a magician,
p77
aVa wizard, if you will, a real wizard.
p78
aVIf someone were to appear on this stage in front of me
p79
aVand actually claim to be
p80
aVan ancient prince of Denmark named Hamlet,
p81
aVyou would be insulted
p82
aVand rightly so.
p83
aVWhy would a man assume that you would believe
p84
aVsomething bizarre like this?
p85
aVBut there exists out there
p86
aVa very large population
p87
aVof people who will tell you
p88
aVthat they have psychic, magical powers
p89
aVthat they can predict the future,
p90
aVthat they can make contact with the deceased.
p91
aVOh, they also say
p92
aVthey will sell you astrology
p93
aVor other fortunetelling methods.
p94
aVOh, they gladly sell you that, yes.
p95
aVAnd they also say
p96
aVthat they can give you perpetual motion machines
p97
aVand free energy systems.
p98
aVThey claim to be psychics,
p99
aVor sensitives, whatever they can.
p100
aa(lp101
VBut the one thing that has made a big comeback
p102
aVjust recently
p103
aVis this business of
p104
aVspeaking with the dead.
p105
aVNow, to my innocent mind,
p106
aVdead implies
p107
aVincapable of communicating. (Laughter)
p108
aVYou might agree with me on that.
p109
aVBut these people, they tend to tell you that
p110
aVnot only can they communicate with the dead \u2014
p111
aV"Hi, there" \u2014
p112
aVbut they can hear the dead as well,
p113
aVand they can relay this information back to the living.
p114
aVI wonder if that's true.
p115
aVI don't think so, because
p116
aVthis subculture of people
p117
aVuse exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do,
p118
aVexactly the same \u2014
p119
aVthe same physical methods, the same psychological methods \u2014
p120
aVand they effectively and profoundly
p121
aVdeceive millions of people around the earth,
p122
aVto their detriment.
p123
aVThey deceive these people,
p124
aVcosts them a lot of money,
p125
aVcost them a lot of emotional anguish.
p126
aVBillions of dollars are spent
p127
aVevery year, all over the globe,
p128
aVon these charlatans.
p129
aa(lp130
VNow, I have two questions
p131
aVI would like to ask these people
p132
aVif I had the opportunity to do so.
p133
aVFirst question: If I want to ask them to call up \u2014
p134
aVbecause they do hear them through the ear.
p135
aVThey listen to the spirits like this \u2014
p136
aVI'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother
p137
aVbecause, when she died, she had the family will,
p138
aVand she secreted it someplace. We don't know where it is,
p139
aVso we ask Granny, "Where is the will, Granny?"
p140
aVWhat does Granny say? She says, "I'm in heaven and it's wonderful.
p141
aVI'm here with all my old friends, my deceased friends,
p142
aVand my family
p143
aVand all the puppy dogs and the kittens that I used to have when I was a little girl.
p144
aVAnd I love you, and I'll always be with you.
p145
aVGood bye."
p146
aVAnd she didn't answer the damn question!
p147
aVWhere is the will?
p148
aVNow, she could easily have said,
p149
aV"Oh, it's in the library on the second shelf, behind the encyclopedia,"
p150
aVbut she doesn't say that. No, she doesn't.
p151
aVShe doesn't bring any useful information to us.
p152
aVWe paid a lot of money for that information,
p153
aVbe we didn't get it.
p154
aa(lp155
VThe second question that I'd like to ask, rather simple:
p156
aVSuppose I ask them to contact
p157
aVthe spirit of my deceased father-in-law, as an example.
p158
aVWhy do they insist on saying \u2014
p159
aVremember, they speak into this ear \u2014
p160
aVwhy do they say, "My name starts with J or M?"
p161
aVIs this a hunting game?
p162
aVHunting and fishing? What is it?
p163
aVIs it 20 questions? No, it's more like 120 questions.
p164
aVBut it is a cruel, vicious,
p165
aVabsolutely conscienceless \u2014
p166
aVI'll be all right, keep your seats (Laughter) \u2014
p167
aVgame that these people play.
p168
aVAnd they take advantage of the innocent, the naive,
p169
aVthe grieving, the needy people out there.
p170
aa(lp171
VNow, this is a process
p172
aVthat is called cold reading.
p173
aVThere's one fellow out there,
p174
aVVan Praagh is his name, James Van Praagh.
p175
aVHe's one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing.
p176
aVJohn Edward, Sylvia Browne
p177
aVand Rosemary Altea, they are other operators.
p178
aVThere are hundreds of them all over the earth, but in this country,
p179
aVJames Van Praagh is very big.
p180
aVAnd what does he do? He likes to tell you
p181
aVhow the deceased got deceased,
p182
aVthe people he's talking to through his ear, you see?
p183
aVSo what he says is, very often, is like this: he says,
p184
aV"He tells me, he tells me, before he passed,
p185
aVthat he had trouble breathing."
p186
aVFolks, that's what dying is all about!
p187
aV(Laughter)
p188
aVYou stop breathing, and then you're dead.
p189
aVIt's that simple.
p190
aVAnd that's the kind of information they're going to bring back to you?
p191
aVI don't think so.
p192
aVNow, these people will make guesses, they'll say things like,
p193
aV"Why am I getting electricity?
p194
aVHe's saying to me, 'Electricity.'
p195
aVWas he an electrician?" "No."
p196
aV"Did he ever have an electric razor?" "No."
p197
aVIt was a game of hunting questions like this.
p198
aVThis is what they go through.
p199
aa(lp200
VNow, folks often ask us
p201
aVat the James Randi Educational Foundation,
p202
aVthey call me, they say, "Why are you so concerned about this, Mr. Randi?
p203
aVIsn't it just a lot of fun?"
p204
aVNo, it is not fun. It is a cruel farce.
p205
aVNow, it may bring a certain amount of comfort,
p206
aVbut that comfort lasts
p207
aVonly about 20 minutes or so.
p208
aVAnd then the people look in the mirror, and they say,
p209
aVI just paid a lot of money for that reading.
p210
aVAnd what did she say to me? 'I love you!'"
p211
aVThey always say that.
p212
aVThey don't get any information,
p213
aVthey don't get any value for what they spend.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow, Sylvia Browne is the big operator.
p216
aVWe call her "The Talons."
p217
aVSylvia Browne \u2014 thank you \u2014
p218
aVSylvia Browne is the big operator
p219
aVin this field at this very moment.
p220
aVNow, Sylvia Browne \u2014 just to show you \u2014
p221
aVshe actually gets 700 dollars
p222
aVfor a 20 minute reading over the telephone,
p223
aVshe doesn't even go there in person,
p224
aVand you have to wait up to two years because
p225
aVshe's booked ahead that amount of time.
p226
aVYou pay by credit card or whatever,
p227
aVand then she will call you
p228
aVsometime in the next two years.
p229
aVYou can tell it's her. "Hello, this is Sylvia Browne."
p230
aVThat's her, you can tell right away.
p231
aVNow, Montel Williams is an intelligent man.
p232
aVWe all know who he is on television.
p233
aVHe's well educated, he's smart,
p234
aVhe knows what Sylvia Browne is doing
p235
aVbut he doesn't give a damn.
p236
aVHe just doesn't care.
p237
aVBecause, the bottom line is, the sponsors love it,
p238
aVand he will expose her
p239
aVto television publicity all the time.
p240
aa(lp241
VNow, what does Sylvia Browne give you for that 700 dollars?
p242
aVShe gives you the names of your guardian angels, that's first.
p243
aVNow, without that, how could we possibly function? (Laughter)
p244
aVShe gives you the names of previous lives,
p245
aVwho you were in previous lives.
p246
aVDuh.
p247
aVIt turns out that the women
p248
aVthat she gives readings for
p249
aVwere all Babylonian princesses, or something like that.
p250
aVAnd the men were all Grecian warriors
p251
aVfighting with Agamemnon.
p252
aVNothing is ever said about
p253
aVa 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of London
p254
aVwho died of consumption.
p255
aVHe isn't worth bringing back, obviously.
p256
aVAnd the strange thing \u2014 folks, you may have noticed this too.
p257
aVYou see these folks on television \u2014
p258
aVthey never call anybody back from hell. (Laughter)
p259
aVEveryone comes back from heaven, but never from hell.
p260
aVIf they call back any of my friends,
p261
aVthey're not going to... Well, you see the story.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
VNow, Sylvia Browne is an exception,
p266
aVan exception in one way,
p267
aVbecause the James Randi Educational Foundation, my foundation,
p268
aVoffers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds.
p269
aVVery simply won.
p270
aVAll you have to do is prove any paranormal, occult
p271
aVor supernatural event or power of any kind
p272
aVunder proper observing conditions.
p273
aVIt's very easy, win the million dollars.
p274
aVSylvia Browne is an exception in that
p275
aVshe's the only professional psychic
p276
aVin the whole world
p277
aVthat has accepted our challenge.
p278
aVShe did this on the "Larry King Live" show on CNN
p279
aVsix and a half years ago.
p280
aVAnd we haven't heard from her since. Strange.
p281
aVShe said that, first of all, that she didn't know how to contact me.
p282
aVDuh.
p283
aVA professional psychic who speaks to dead people,
p284
aVshe can't reach me?
p285
aV(Laughter)
p286
aVI'm alive, you may have noticed.
p287
aVWell, pretty well anyway.
p288
aVShe couldn't reach me. Now she says she doesn't want to reach me
p289
aVbecause I'm a godless person.
p290
aVAll the more reason to take the million dollars,
p291
aVwouldn't you think, Sylvia?
p292
aa(lp293
VNow these people need to be stopped, seriously now.
p294
aVThey need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce.
p295
aVWe get people coming to the foundation all the time.
p296
aVThey're ruined financially and emotionally
p297
aVbecause they've given their money and their faith
p298
aVto these people.
p299
aa(lp300
VNow, I popped some pills earlier.
p301
aVI have to explain that to you.
p302
aVHomeopathy, let's find out what that's all about.
p303
aVHmm. You've heard of it.
p304
aVIt's an alternative form of healing, right?
p305
aVHomeopathy actually consists \u2014 and that's what this is.
p306
aVThis is Calms Forte,
p307
aV32 caplets of sleeping pills! I forgot to tell you that.
p308
aVI just ingested
p309
aVsix and a half days worth of sleeping pills.
p310
aV(Laughter)
p311
aVSix and a half days, that certainly is a fatal dose.
p312
aVIt says right on the back here,
p313
aV"In case of overdose,
p314
aVcontact your poison control center immediately,"
p315
aVand it gives an 800 number.
p316
aVKeep your seats \u2014 it's going to be okay.
p317
aVI don't really need it
p318
aVbecause I've been doing this stunt
p319
aVfor audiences all over the world
p320
aVfor the last eight or 10 years,
p321
aVtaking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills.
p322
aa(lp323
VWhy don't they affect me?
p324
aV(Laughter)
p325
aV(Applause)
p326
aVThe answer may surprise you.
p327
aVWhat is homeopathy?
p328
aVIt's taking a medicine that really works
p329
aVand diluting it down
p330
aVwell beyond Avogadro's limit.
p331
aVDiluting it down to the point
p332
aVwhere there's none of it left. (Laughter)
p333
aVNow folks, this is not
p334
aVjust a metaphor I'm going to give you now, it's true.
p335
aVIt's exactly equivalent to taking
p336
aVone 325 milligram aspirin tablet,
p337
aVthrowing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe,
p338
aVand then stirring it up, obviously with a very big stick,
p339
aVand waiting two years or so
p340
aVuntil the solution is homogeneous.
p341
aVThen, when you get a headache,
p342
aVyou take a sip of this water, and \u2014 voila! \u2014 it is gone.
p343
aV(Laughter)
p344
aVNow that is true. That is what homeopathy is all about.
p345
aa(lp346
VAnd another claim that they make \u2014 you'll love this one \u2014
p347
aVthe more dilute the medicine is, they say,
p348
aVthe more powerful it is.
p349
aVNow wait a minute, we heard about a guy in Florida.
p350
aVThe poor man, he was on homeopathic medicine.
p351
aVHe died of an overdose.
p352
aVHe forgot to take his pill.
p353
aV(Laughter)
p354
aVWork on it. Work on it.
p355
aVIt's a ridiculous thing. It is absolutely ridiculous.
p356
aVI don't know what we're doing,
p357
aVbelieving in all this nonsense over all these years.
p358
aa(lp359
VNow, let me tell you,
p360
aVThe James Randi Educational Foundation
p361
aVis waving this very big carrot,
p362
aVbut I must say, the fact that nobody
p363
aVhas taken us up on this offer
p364
aVdoesn't mean that the powers don't exist.
p365
aVThey might, some place out there.
p366
aVMaybe these people are just independently wealthy.
p367
aVWell, with Sylvia Browne I would think so.
p368
aVYou know, 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading
p369
aVover the telephone \u2014
p370
aVthat's more than lawyers make!
p371
aVI mean that's a fabulous amount of money.
p372
aVThese people don't need the million dollars perhaps,
p373
aVbut wouldn't you think they'd like to take it
p374
aVjust to make me look silly?
p375
aVJust to get rid of this godless person out there
p376
aVthat Sylvia Browne talks about all the time?
p377
aa(lp378
VI think that something needs to be done about this.
p379
aVWe really would love to have suggestions from you folks
p380
aVon how to contact federal, state
p381
aVand local authorities
p382
aVto get them to do something.
p383
aVIf you find out \u2014 now I understand.
p384
aVWe've seen people, even today, speaking to us
p385
aVabout AIDS epidemics
p386
aVand starving kids around the world
p387
aVand impure water supplies that people have to suffer with.
p388
aVThose are very important,
p389
aVcritically important to us.
p390
aVAnd we must do something about those problems.
p391
aVBut at the same time,
p392
aVas Arthur C. Clarke said,
p393
aVThe rotting of the human mind,
p394
aVthe business of believing in the paranormal and the occult
p395
aVand the supernatural \u2014
p396
aVall of this total nonsense,
p397
aVthis medieval thinking \u2014
p398
aVI think something should be done about that,
p399
aVand it all lies in education.
p400
aVLargely, it's the media
p401
aVwho are to blame for this sort of thing.
p402
aVThey shamelessly promote
p403
aVall kinds of nonsense of this sort
p404
aVbecause it pleases the sponsors.
p405
aVIt's the bottom line, the dollar line.
p406
aVThat's what they're looking at.
p407
aa(lp408
VWe really must do something about this.
p409
aVI'm willing to take your suggestions,
p410
aVand I'm willing to have you
p411
aVtune in to our webpage.
p412
aVIt's www.randi.org.
p413
aVGo in there and look at the archives,
p414
aVand you will begin to understand much more
p415
aVof what I've been talking about today.
p416
aVYou will see the records that we have.
p417
aVThere's nothing like sitting in that library
p418
aVand having a family appear there
p419
aVand say that Mum gave away all the family fortune.
p420
aVShe cashed in the CDs,
p421
aVshe gave away the stocks and the certificates.
p422
aVThat's really sad to hear,
p423
aVand it hasn't helped them one bit,
p424
aVhasn't solved any of their problems.
p425
aVYes, there could be a rotting of the American mind,
p426
aVand of the minds all the way around the earth,
p427
aVif we don't start to think sensibly about these things.
p428
aa(lp429
VNow, we've offered this carrot,
p430
aVas I say, we've dangled the carrot.
p431
aVWe're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it.
p432
aVOh, we get lots of them,
p433
aVhundreds of them every year come by.
p434
aVThese are dowsers and people
p435
aVwho think that they can talk to the dead as well,
p436
aVbut they're amateurs; they don't know how to evaluate
p437
aVtheir own so-called powers.
p438
aVThe professionals never come near us,
p439
aVexcept in that case of Sylvia Browne
p440
aVthat I told you about a moment ago.
p441
aVShe did accept and then backed away.
p442
aVLadies and gentlemen,
p443
aVI'm James Randi,
p444
aVand I'm waiting.
p445
