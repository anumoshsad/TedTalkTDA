VSo my name is Amy Webb,
p4
aVand a few years ago I found myself at the end
p5
aVof yet another fantastic relationship
p6
aVthat came burning down in a spectacular fashion.
p7
aVAnd I thought, what's wrong with me?
p8
aVI don't understand why this keeps happening.
p9
aa(lp10
VSo I asked everybody in my life what they thought.
p11
aVI turned to my grandmother, who always had plenty of advice,
p12
aVand she said, "Stop being so picky.
p13
aVYou've got to date around.
p14
aVAnd most importantly,
p15
aVtrue love will find you when you least expect it."
p16
aa(lp17
VNow as it turns out,
p18
aVI'm somebody who thinks a lot about data,
p19
aVas you'll soon find.
p20
aVI am constantly swimming in numbers, formulas and charts.
p21
aVI also have a very tight-knit family,
p22
aVand I'm very, very close with my sister,
p23
aVand as a result, I wanted to have the same type of family when I grew up.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo I'm at the end of this bad breakup,
p26
aVI'm 30 years old,
p27
aVI figure I'm probably going to have to date somebody for about six months
p28
aVbefore I'm ready to get monogamous
p29
aVand before we can sort of cohabitate,
p30
aVand we have to do that for a while before we can get engaged.
p31
aVAnd if I want to start having children by the time I'm 35,
p32
aVthat meant that I would have had to have been on my way to marriage
p33
aVfive years ago.
p34
aVSo that wasn't going to work.
p35
aa(lp36
VIf my strategy was to least-expect my way into true love,
p37
aVthen the variable that I had to deal with was serendipity.
p38
aVIn short, I was trying to figure out
p39
aVwhat's the probability of my finding Mr. Right?
p40
aVWell, at the time I was living in the city of Philadelphia,
p41
aVand it's a big city, and I figured,
p42
aVin this entire place, there are lots of possibilities.
p43
aVSo again, I started doing some math.
p44
aVPopulation of Philadelphia: it has 1.5 million people.
p45
aVI figure about half of that are men,
p46
aVso that takes the number down to 750,000.
p47
aVI'm looking for a guy between the ages of 30 and 36,
p48
aVwhich was only four percent of the population,
p49
aVso now I'm dealing with the possibility of 30,000 men.
p50
aVI was looking for somebody who was Jewish,
p51
aVbecause I am and that was important to me.
p52
aVThat's only 2.3 percent of the population.
p53
aVI figure I'm attracted to maybe one out of 10 of those men,
p54
aVand there was no way I was going to deal with somebody who was an avid golfer.
p55
aVSo that basically meant there were 35 men for me
p56
aVthat I could possibly date
p57
aVin the entire city of Philadelphia.
p58
aa(lp59
VIn the meantime, my very large Jewish family
p60
aVwas already all married and well on their way
p61
aVto having lots and lots of children,
p62
aVand I felt like I was under tremendous peer pressure
p63
aVto get my life going already.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo I have two possible strategies at this point
p66
aVI'm sort of figuring out.
p67
aVOne, I can take my grandmother's advice
p68
aVand sort of least-expect my way
p69
aVinto maybe bumping into the one out of 35 possible men
p70
aVin the entire 1.5-million-person city of Philadelphia,
p71
aVor I could try online dating.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, I like the idea of online dating,
p74
aVbecause it's predicated on an algorithm,
p75
aVand that's really just a simple way of saying
p76
aVI've got a problem, I'm going to use some data,
p77
aVrun it through a system and get to a solution.
p78
aVSo online dating is the second most popular way
p79
aVthat people now meet each other,
p80
aVbut as it turns out, algorithms have been around
p81
aVfor thousands of years in almost every culture.
p82
aVIn fact, in Judaism, there were matchmakers a long time ago,
p83
aVand though they didn't have an explicit algorithm per se,
p84
aVthey definitely were running through formulas in their heads,
p85
aVlike, is the girl going to like the boy?
p86
aVAre the families going to get along?
p87
aVWhat's the rabbi going to say?
p88
aVAre they going to start having children right away?
p89
aVThe matchmaker would sort of think through all of this,
p90
aVput two people together, and that would be the end of it.
p91
aVSo in my case, I thought,
p92
aVwell, will data and an algorithm lead me to my Prince Charming?
p93
aVSo I decided to sign on.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, there was one small catch.
p96
aVAs I'm signing on to the various dating websites,
p97
aVas it happens, I was really, really busy.
p98
aVBut that actually wasn't the biggest problem.
p99
aVThe biggest problem is that I hate filling out questionnaires of any kind,
p100
aVand I certainly don't like questionnaires that are like Cosmo quizzes.
p101
aVSo I just copied and pasted from my résumé.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VSo in the descriptive part up top,
p106
aVI said that I was an award-winning journalist
p107
aVand a future thinker.
p108
aVWhen I was asked about fun activities and my ideal date,
p109
aVI said monetization and fluency in Japanese.
p110
aVI talked a lot about JavaScript.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VSo obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward.
p115
aVBut the real failure was that there were plenty of men for me to date.
p116
aVThese algorithms had a sea full of men
p117
aVthat wanted to take me out on lots of dates \u2014
p118
aVwhat turned out to be truly awful dates.
p119
aa(lp120
VThere was this guy Steve, the I.T. guy.
p121
aVThe algorithm matched us up because we share a love of gadgets,
p122
aVwe share a love of math and data and '80s music,
p123
aVand so I agreed to go out with him.
p124
aVSo Steve the I.T. guy invited me out
p125
aVto one of Philadelphia's white-table-cloth,
p126
aVextremely expensive restaurants.
p127
aVAnd we went in, and right off the bat,
p128
aVour conversation really wasn't taking flight,
p129
aVbut he was ordering a lot of food.
p130
aVIn fact, he didn't even bother looking at the menu.
p131
aVHe was ordering multiple appetizers, multiple entrées, for me as well,
p132
aVand suddenly there are piles and piles of food on our table,
p133
aValso lots and lots of bottles of wine.
p134
aVSo we're nearing the end of our conversation
p135
aVand the end of dinner, and I've decided
p136
aVSteve the I.T. guy and I are really just not meant for each other,
p137
aVbut we'll part ways as friends,
p138
aVwhen he gets up to go to the bathroom,
p139
aVand in the meantime, the bill comes to our table.
p140
aVAnd listen, I'm a modern woman.
p141
aVI am totally down with splitting the bill.
p142
aVBut then Steve the I.T. guy didn't come back.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Gasping)
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd that was my entire month's rent.
p147
aa(lp148
V(Audience gasps)
p149
aa(lp150
VSo needless to say, I was not having a good night.
p151
aVSo I run home, I call my mother, I call my sister,
p152
aVand as I do, at the end of each one of these terrible, terrible dates,
p153
aVI regale them with the details.
p154
aVAnd they say to me,
p155
aV"Stop complaining."
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
V"You're just being too picky."
p160
aa(lp161
VSo I said, fine, from here on out I'm only going on dates
p162
aVwhere I know there's Wi-Fi, and I'm bringing my laptop.
p163
aVI'm going to shove it into my bag,
p164
aVI'm going to have this email template,
p165
aVand I'm going to fill it out and collect information
p166
aVon all these different data points during the date
p167
aVto prove to everybody that empirically,
p168
aVthese dates really are terrible.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VSo I started tracking things like really stupid, awkward, sexual remarks;
p173
aVbad vocabulary;
p174
aVthe number of times a man forced me to high-five him.
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VSo I started to crunch some numbers,
p179
aVand that allowed me to make some correlations.
p180
aVSo as it turns out,
p181
aVfor some reason, men who drink Scotch reference kinky sex immediately.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VWell, it turns out that these probably weren't bad guys.
p186
aVThere were just bad for me.
p187
aVAnd as it happens, the algorithms that were setting us up,
p188
aVthey weren't bad either.
p189
aVThese algorithms were doing exactly what they were designed to do,
p190
aVwhich was to take our user-generated information,
p191
aVin my case, my résumé,
p192
aVand match it up with other people's information.
p193
aVSee, the real problem here is that,
p194
aVwhile the algorithms work just fine,
p195
aVyou and I don't,
p196
aVwhen confronted with blank windows
p197
aVwhere we're supposed to input our information online.
p198
aVVery few of us have the ability
p199
aVto be totally and brutally honest with ourselves.
p200
aVThe other problem is that these websites are asking us
p201
aVquestions like, are you a dog person or a cat person?
p202
aVDo you like horror films or romance films?
p203
aVI'm not looking for a pen pal.
p204
aVI'm looking for a husband. Right?
p205
aVSo there's a certain amount of superficiality in that data.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo I said fine, I've got a new plan.
p208
aVI'm going to keep using these online dating sites,
p209
aVbut I'm going to treat them as databases,
p210
aVand rather than waiting for an algorithm to set me up,
p211
aVI think I'm going to try reverse-engineering this entire system.
p212
aVSo knowing that there was superficial data
p213
aVthat was being used to match me up with other people,
p214
aVI decided instead to ask my own questions.
p215
aVWhat was every single possible thing
p216
aVthat I could think of that I was looking for in a mate?
p217
aa(lp218
VSo I started writing
p219
aVand writing and writing,
p220
aVand at the end, I had amassed 72 different data points.
p221
aVI wanted somebody was Jew-ish,
p222
aVso I was looking for somebody
p223
aVwho had the same background and thoughts on our culture,
p224
aVbut wasn't going to force me to go to shul every Friday and Saturday.
p225
aVI wanted somebody who worked hard,
p226
aVbecause work for me is extremely important,
p227
aVbut not too hard.
p228
aVFor me, the hobbies that I have
p229
aVare really just new work projects that I've launched.
p230
aVI also wanted somebody who not only wanted two children,
p231
aVbut was going to have the same attitude toward parenting that I do,
p232
aVso somebody who was going to be totally okay
p233
aVwith forcing our child to start taking piano lessons at age three,
p234
aVand also maybe computer science classes if we could wrangle it.
p235
aVSo things like that, but I also wanted somebody
p236
aVwho would go to far-flung, exotic places, like Petra, Jordan.
p237
aVI also wanted somebody who would weigh 20 pounds more than me at all times,
p238
aVregardless of what I weighed.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VSo I now have these 72 different data points,
p243
aVwhich, to be fair, is a lot.
p244
aVSo what I did was, I went through and I prioritized that list.
p245
aVI broke it into a top tier and a second tier of points,
p246
aVand I ranked everything starting at 100
p247
aVand going all the way down to 91,
p248
aVand listing things like I was looking for somebody who was really smart,
p249
aVwho would challenge and stimulate me,
p250
aVand balancing that with a second tier and a second set of points.
p251
aVThese things were also important to me but not necessarily deal-breakers.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
VSo once I had all this done, I then built a scoring system,
p256
aVbecause what I wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate
p257
aVwhether or not I thought the guy that I found online
p258
aVwould be a match with me.
p259
aVI figured there would be a minimum of 700 points
p260
aVbefore I would agree to email somebody or respond to an email message.
p261
aVFor 900 points, I'd agree to go out on a date,
p262
aVand I wouldn't even consider any kind of relationship
p263
aVbefore somebody had crossed the 1,500 point threshold.
p264
aa(lp265
VWell, as it turns out, this worked pretty well.
p266
aVSo I go back online now.
p267
aVI found Jewishdoc57
p268
aVwho's incredibly good-looking, incredibly well-spoken,
p269
aVhe had hiked Mt. Fuji,
p270
aVhe had walked along the Great Wall.
p271
aVHe likes to travel
p272
aVas long as it doesn't involve a cruise ship.
p273
aVAnd I thought,
p274
aVI've done it!
p275
aVI've cracked the code.
p276
aVI have just found the Jewish Prince Charming
p277
aVof my family's dreams.
p278
aa(lp279
VThere was only one problem:
p280
aVHe didn't like me back.
p281
aVAnd I guess the one variable that I haven't considered
p282
aVis the competition.
p283
aVWho are all of the other women on these dating sites?
p284
aVI found SmileyGirl1978.
p285
aVShe said she was a "Fun girl who is Happy and Outgoing."
p286
aVShe listed her job as "teacher."
p287
aVShe said she is "silly, nice and friendly."
p288
aVShe likes to make people laugh "alot."
p289
aa(lp290
VAt this moment I knew,
p291
aVclicking profile after profile that looked like this,
p292
aVthat I needed to do some market research.
p293
aVSo I created 10 fake male profiles.
p294
aVNow, before I lose all of you \u2014
p295
aa(lp296
V(Laughter) \u2014
p297
aa(lp298
Vunderstand that I did this strictly to gather data
p299
aVabout everybody else in the system.
p300
aVI didn't carry on crazy Catfish-style relationships with anybody.
p301
aVI really was just scraping their data.
p302
aVBut I didn't want everybody's data.
p303
aVI only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted
p304
aVto the type of man that I really, really wanted to marry.
p305
aa(lp306
VWhen I released these men into the wild,
p307
aVI did follow some rules.
p308
aVSo I didn't reach out to any woman first.
p309
aVI just waited to see who these profiles were going to attract,
p310
aVand mainly what I was looking at was two different data sets.
p311
aVSo I was looking at qualitative data,
p312
aVso what was the humor, the tone,
p313
aVthe voice, the communication style
p314
aVthat these women shared in common?
p315
aVAnd also quantitative data,
p316
aVso what was the average length of their profile,
p317
aVhow much time was spent between messages?
p318
aVWhat I was trying to get at here was that I figured, in person,
p319
aVI would be just as competitive as a SmileyGirl1978.
p320
aVI wanted to figure out how to maximize my own profile online.
p321
aa(lp322
VWell, one month later,
p323
aVI had a lot of data, and I was able to do another analysis.
p324
aVAnd as it turns out, content matters a lot.
p325
aVSo smart people tend to write a lot \u2014
p326
aV3,000, 4,000, 5,000 words about themselves,
p327
aVwhich may all be very, very interesting.
p328
aVThe challenge here, though, is that the popular men and women
p329
aVare sticking to 97 words on average
p330
aVthat are written very, very well,
p331
aVeven though it may not seem like it all the time.
p332
aVThe other hallmark of the people who do this well
p333
aVis that they're using non-specific language.
p334
aVSo in my case,
p335
aV"The English Patient" is my most favorite movie ever,
p336
aVbut it doesn't work to use that in a profile,
p337
aVbecause that's a superficial data point,
p338
aVand somebody may disagree
p339
aVand decide they don't want to go out
p340
aVbecause they didn't like sitting through the three-hour movie.
p341
aa(lp342
VAlso, optimistic language matters a lot.
p343
aVSo this is a word cloud
p344
aVhighlighting the most popular words that were used
p345
aVby the most popular women,
p346
aVwords like "fun" and "girl" and "love."
p347
aVAnd what I realized was not that I had to dumb down my own profile.
p348
aVRemember, I'm somebody who said
p349
aVthat I speak fluent Japanese and I know JavaScript
p350
aVand I was okay with that.
p351
aVThe difference is that it's about being more approachable
p352
aVand helping people understand the best way to reach out to you.
p353
aa(lp354
VAnd as it turns out, timing is also really, really important.
p355
aVJust because you have access to somebody's mobile phone number
p356
aVor their instant message account
p357
aVand it's 2 o'clock in the morning and you happen to be awake,
p358
aVdoesn't mean that that's a good time to communicate with those people.
p359
aVThe popular women on these online sites
p360
aVspend an average of 23 hours in between each communication.
p361
aVAnd that's what we would normally do in the usual process of courtship.
p362
aa(lp363
VAnd finally \u2014
p364
aVthere were the photos.
p365
aVAll of the women who were popular showed some skin.
p366
aVThey all looked really great,
p367
aVwhich turned out to be in sharp contrast
p368
aVto what I had uploaded.
p369
aa(lp370
V(Laughter)
p371
aa(lp372
VOnce I had all of this information,
p373
aVI was able to create a super profile,
p374
aVso it was still me,
p375
aVbut it was me optimized now for this ecosystem.
p376
aVAnd as it turns out, I did a really good job.
p377
aVI was the most popular person online.
p378
aa(lp379
V(Laughter)
p380
aa(lp381
V(Applause)
p382
aa(lp383
VAnd as it turns out, lots and lots of men wanted to date me.
p384
aVSo I call my mom, I call my sister, I call my grandmother.
p385
aVI'm telling them about this fabulous news,
p386
aVand they say, "This is wonderful! How soon are you going out?"
p387
aVI said, "Actually, I'm not going to go out with anybody."
p388
aVBecause remember, in my scoring system,
p389
aVthey have to reach a minimum threshold of 700 points,
p390
aVand none of them have done that.
p391
aVThey said, "What? You're still being too damn picky."
p392
aa(lp393
VWell, not too long after that, I found this guy, Thevenin,
p394
aVand he said that he was culturally Jewish,
p395
aVhe said that his job was an arctic baby seal hunter,
p396
aVwhich I thought was very clever.
p397
aVHe talked in detail about travel.
p398
aVHe made a lot of really interesting cultural references.
p399
aVHe looked and talked exactly like what I wanted,
p400
aVand immediately, he scored 850 points.
p401
aVIt was enough for a date.
p402
aa(lp403
VThree weeks later, we met up in person
p404
aVfor what turned out to be a 14-hour-long conversation
p405
aVthat went from coffee shop to restaurant
p406
aVto another coffee shop to another restaurant,
p407
aVand when he dropped me back off at my house that night
p408
aVI re-scored him \u2014
p409
aa(lp410
V[1,050 points!]
p411
aa(lp412
VThought, you know what,
p413
aVthis entire time, I haven't been picky enough.
p414
aVWell, a year and a half after that,
p415
aVwe were non-cruise ship traveling
p416
aVthrough Petra, Jordan,
p417
aVwhen he got down on his knee and proposed.
p418
aVA year after that, we were married,
p419
aVand about a year and a half after that,
p420
aVour daughter, Petra, was born.
p421
aa(lp422
VAudience: Oh!
p423
aa(lp424
V(Applause)
p425
aa(lp426
V[What it means...]
p427
aa(lp428
VObviously, I'm having a fabulous life, so \u2014
p429
aa(lp430
V(Laughter)
p431
aa(lp432
VThe question is, what does all of this mean for you?
p433
aa(lp434
VWell, as it turns out, there is an algorithm for love.
p435
aVIt's just not the ones that we're being presented with online.
p436
aVIn fact, it's something that you write yourself.
p437
aVSo whether you're looking for a husband or a wife
p438
aVor you're trying to find your passion
p439
aVor you're trying to start a business,
p440
aVall you have to really do is figure out your own framework
p441
aVand play by your own rules,
p442
aVand feel free to be as picky as you want.
p443
aa(lp444
VWell, on my wedding day,
p445
aVI had a conversation again with my grandmother,
p446
aVand she said, "All right, maybe I was wrong.
p447
aVIt looks like you did come up with a really, really great system.
p448
aVNow, your matzah balls ...
p449
aVThey should be fluffy, not hard."
p450
aa(lp451
V(Laughter)
p452
aa(lp453
VAnd I'll take her advice on that.
