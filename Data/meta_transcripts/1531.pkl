VLike many of you, I'm one of the lucky people.
p4
aVI was born to a family where education was pervasive.
p5
aVI'm a third-generation PhD, a daughter of two academics.
p6
aVIn my childhood, I played around in my father's university lab.
p7
aVSo it was taken for granted that I attend some of the best universities,
p8
aVwhich in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity.
p9
aa(lp10
VUnfortunately, most of the people in the world are not so lucky.
p11
aVIn some parts of the world, for example, South Africa,
p12
aVeducation is just not readily accessible.
p13
aVIn South Africa, the educational system was constructed
p14
aVin the days of apartheid for the white minority.
p15
aVAnd as a consequence, today there is just not enough spots
p16
aVfor the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education.
p17
aVThat scarcity led to a crisis in January of this year
p18
aVat the University of Johannesburg.
p19
aVThere were a handful of positions left open
p20
aVfrom the standard admissions process, and the night before
p21
aVthey were supposed to open that for registration,
p22
aVthousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long,
p23
aVhoping to be first in line to get one of those positions.
p24
aVWhen the gates opened, there was a stampede,
p25
aVand 20 people were injured and one woman died.
p26
aVShe was a mother who gave her life
p27
aVtrying to get her son a chance at a better life.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut even in parts of the world like the United States
p30
aVwhere education is available, it might not be within reach.
p31
aVThere has been much discussed in the last few years
p32
aVabout the rising cost of health care.
p33
aVWhat might not be quite as obvious to people
p34
aVis that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition
p35
aVhas been increasing at almost twice the rate,
p36
aVfor a total of 559 percent since 1985.
p37
aVThis makes education unaffordable for many people.
p38
aa(lp39
VFinally, even for those who do manage to get the higher education,
p40
aVthe doors of opportunity might not open.
p41
aVOnly a little over half of recent college graduates
p42
aVin the United States who get a higher education
p43
aVactually are working in jobs that require that education.
p44
aVThis, of course, is not true for the students
p45
aVwho graduate from the top institutions,
p46
aVbut for many others, they do not get the value
p47
aVfor their time and their effort.
p48
aa(lp49
VTom Friedman, in his recent New York Times article,
p50
aVcaptured, in the way that no one else could, the spirit behind our effort.
p51
aVHe said the big breakthroughs are what happen
p52
aVwhen what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary.
p53
aVI've talked about what's desperately necessary.
p54
aVLet's talk about what's suddenly possible.
p55
aa(lp56
VWhat's suddenly possible was demonstrated by
p57
aVthree big Stanford classes,
p58
aVeach of which had an enrollment of 100,000 people or more.
p59
aVSo to understand this, let's look at one of those classes,
p60
aVthe Machine Learning class offered by my colleague
p61
aVand cofounder Andrew Ng.
p62
aVAndrew teaches one of the bigger Stanford classes.
p63
aVIt's a Machine Learning class,
p64
aVand it has 400 people enrolled every time it's offered.
p65
aVWhen Andrew taught the Machine Learning class to the general public,
p66
aVit had 100,000 people registered.
p67
aVSo to put that number in perspective,
p68
aVfor Andrew to reach that same size audience
p69
aVby teaching a Stanford class,
p70
aVhe would have to do that for 250 years.
p71
aVOf course, he'd get really bored.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo, having seen the impact of this,
p74
aVAndrew and I decided that we needed to really try and scale this up,
p75
aVto bring the best quality education to as many people as we could.
p76
aVSo we formed Coursera,
p77
aVwhose goal is to take the best courses
p78
aVfrom the best instructors at the best universities
p79
aVand provide it to everyone around the world for free.
p80
aVWe currently have 43 courses on the platform
p81
aVfrom four universities across a range of disciplines,
p82
aVand let me show you a little bit of an overview
p83
aVof what that looks like.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Video) Robert Ghrist: Welcome to Calculus.
p86
aa(lp87
VEzekiel Emanuel: Fifty million people are uninsured.
p88
aa(lp89
VScott Page: Models help us design more effective institutions and policies.
p90
aVWe get unbelievable segregation.
p91
aa(lp92
VScott Klemmer: So Bush imagined that in the future,
p93
aVyou'd wear a camera right in the center of your head.
p94
aa(lp95
VMitchell Duneier: Mills wants the student of sociology to develop the quality of mind ...
p96
aa(lp97
VRG: Hanging cable takes on the form of a hyperbolic cosine.
p98
aa(lp99
VNick Parlante: For each pixel in the image, set the red to zero.
p100
aa(lp101
VPaul Offit: ... Vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus.
p102
aa(lp103
VDan Jurafsky: Does Lufthansa serve breakfast and San Jose? Well, that sounds funny.
p104
aa(lp105
VDaphne Koller: So this is which coin you pick, and this is the two tosses.
p106
aa(lp107
VAndrew Ng: So in large-scale machine learning, we'd like to come up with computational ...
p108
aa(lp109
V(Applause)
p110
aa(lp111
VDK: It turns out, maybe not surprisingly,
p112
aVthat students like getting the best content
p113
aVfrom the best universities for free.
p114
aVSince we opened the website in February,
p115
aVwe now have 640,000 students from 190 countries.
p116
aVWe have 1.5 million enrollments,
p117
aV6 million quizzes in the 15 classes that have launched
p118
aVso far have been submitted, and 14 million videos have been viewed.
p119
aa(lp120
VBut it's not just about the numbers,
p121
aVit's also about the people.
p122
aVWhether it's Akash, who comes from a small town in India
p123
aVand would never have access in this case
p124
aVto a Stanford-quality course
p125
aVand would never be able to afford it.
p126
aVOr Jenny, who is a single mother of two
p127
aVand wants to hone her skills
p128
aVso that she can go back and complete her master's degree.
p129
aVOr Ryan, who can't go to school,
p130
aVbecause his immune deficient daughter
p131
aVcan't be risked to have germs come into the house,
p132
aVso he couldn't leave the house.
p133
aVI'm really glad to say \u2014
p134
aVrecently, we've been in correspondence with Ryan \u2014
p135
aVthat this story had a happy ending.
p136
aVBaby Shannon \u2014 you can see her on the left \u2014
p137
aVis doing much better now,
p138
aVand Ryan got a job by taking some of our courses.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo what made these courses so different?
p141
aVAfter all, online course content has been available for a while.
p142
aVWhat made it different was that this was real course experience.
p143
aVIt started on a given day,
p144
aVand then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis
p145
aVand do homework assignments.
p146
aVAnd these would be real homework assignments
p147
aVfor a real grade, with a real deadline.
p148
aVYou can see the deadlines and the usage graph.
p149
aVThese are the spikes showing
p150
aVthat procrastination is global phenomenon.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VAt the end of the course,
p155
aVthe students got a certificate.
p156
aVThey could present that certificate
p157
aVto a prospective employer and get a better job,
p158
aVand we know many students who did.
p159
aVSome students took their certificate
p160
aVand presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled
p161
aVfor actual college credit.
p162
aVSo these students were really getting something meaningful
p163
aVfor their investment of time and effort.
p164
aa(lp165
VLet's talk a little bit about some of the components
p166
aVthat go into these courses.
p167
aVThe first component is that when you move away
p168
aVfrom the constraints of a physical classroom
p169
aVand design content explicitly for an online format,
p170
aVyou can break away from, for example,
p171
aVthe monolithic one-hour lecture.
p172
aVYou can break up the material, for example,
p173
aVinto these short, modular units of eight to 12 minutes,
p174
aVeach of which represents a coherent concept.
p175
aVStudents can traverse this material in different ways,
p176
aVdepending on their background, their skills or their interests.
p177
aVSo, for example, some students might benefit
p178
aVfrom a little bit of preparatory material
p179
aVthat other students might already have.
p180
aVOther students might be interested in a particular
p181
aVenrichment topic that they want to pursue individually.
p182
aVSo this format allows us to break away
p183
aVfrom the one-size-fits-all model of education,
p184
aVand allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum.
p185
aa(lp186
VOf course, we all know as educators
p187
aVthat students don't learn by sitting and passively watching videos.
p188
aVPerhaps one of the biggest components of this effort
p189
aVis that we need to have students
p190
aVwho practice with the material
p191
aVin order to really understand it.
p192
aVThere's been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this.
p193
aVThis one that appeared in Science last year, for example,
p194
aVdemonstrates that even simple retrieval practice,
p195
aVwhere students are just supposed to repeat
p196
aVwhat they already learned
p197
aVgives considerably improved results
p198
aVon various achievement tests down the line
p199
aVthan many other educational interventions.
p200
aa(lp201
VWe've tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform,
p202
aVas well as other forms of practice in many ways.
p203
aVFor example, even our videos are not just videos.
p204
aVEvery few minutes, the video pauses
p205
aVand the students get asked a question.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Video) SP: ... These four things. Prospect theory, hyperbolic discounting,
p208
aVstatus quo bias, base rate bias. They're all well documented.
p209
aVSo they're all well documented deviations from rational behavior.
p210
aa(lp211
VDK: So here the video pauses,
p212
aVand the student types in the answer into the box
p213
aVand submits. Obviously they weren't paying attention.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VSo they get to try again,
p218
aVand this time they got it right.
p219
aVThere's an optional explanation if they want.
p220
aVAnd now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture.
p221
aVThis is a kind of simple question
p222
aVthat I as an instructor might ask in class,
p223
aVbut when I ask that kind of a question in class,
p224
aV80 percent of the students
p225
aVare still scribbling the last thing I said,
p226
aV15 percent are zoned out on Facebook,
p227
aVand then there's the smarty pants in the front row
p228
aVwho blurts out the answer
p229
aVbefore anyone else has had a chance to think about it,
p230
aVand I as the instructor am terribly gratified
p231
aVthat somebody actually knew the answer.
p232
aVAnd so the lecture moves on before, really,
p233
aVmost of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked.
p234
aVHere, every single student
p235
aVhas to engage with the material.
p236
aa(lp237
VAnd of course these simple retrieval questions
p238
aVare not the end of the story.
p239
aVOne needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions,
p240
aVand one also needs to provide the students with feedback
p241
aVon those questions.
p242
aVNow, how do you grade the work of 100,000 students
p243
aVif you do not have 10,000 TAs?
p244
aVThe answer is, you need to use technology
p245
aVto do it for you.
p246
aVNow, fortunately, technology has come a long way,
p247
aVand we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework.
p248
aVIn addition to multiple choice
p249
aVand the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video,
p250
aVwe can also grade math, mathematical expressions
p251
aVas well as mathematical derivations.
p252
aVWe can grade models, whether it's
p253
aVfinancial models in a business class
p254
aVor physical models in a science or engineering class
p255
aVand we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments.
p256
aa(lp257
VLet me show you one that's actually pretty simple
p258
aVbut fairly visual.
p259
aVThis is from Stanford's Computer Science 101 class,
p260
aVand the students are supposed to color-correct
p261
aVthat blurry red image.
p262
aVThey're typing their program into the browser,
p263
aVand you can see they didn't get it quite right, Lady Liberty is still seasick.
p264
aVAnd so, the student tries again, and now they got it right, and they're told that,
p265
aVand they can move on to the next assignment.
p266
aVThis ability to interact actively with the material
p267
aVand be told when you're right or wrong
p268
aVis really essential to student learning.
p269
aa(lp270
VNow, of course we cannot yet grade
p271
aVthe range of work that one needs for all courses.
p272
aVSpecifically, what's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work
p273
aVthat is so essential in such disciplines
p274
aVas the humanities, the social sciences, business and others.
p275
aVSo we tried to convince, for example,
p276
aVsome of our humanities faculty
p277
aVthat multiple choice was not such a bad strategy.
p278
aVThat didn't go over really well.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo we had to come up with a different solution.
p281
aVAnd the solution we ended up using is peer grading.
p282
aVIt turns out that previous studies show,
p283
aVlike this one by Saddler and Good,
p284
aVthat peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy
p285
aVfor providing reproducible grades.
p286
aVIt was tried only in small classes,
p287
aVbut there it showed, for example,
p288
aVthat these student-assigned grades on the y-axis
p289
aVare actually very well correlated
p290
aVwith the teacher-assigned grade on the x-axis.
p291
aVWhat's even more surprising is that self-grades,
p292
aVwhere the students grade their own work critically \u2014
p293
aVso long as you incentivize them properly
p294
aVso they can't give themselves a perfect score \u2014
p295
aVare actually even better correlated with the teacher grades.
p296
aVAnd so this is an effective strategy
p297
aVthat can be used for grading at scale,
p298
aVand is also a useful learning strategy for the students,
p299
aVbecause they actually learn from the experience.
p300
aVSo we now have the largest peer-grading pipeline ever devised,
p301
aVwhere tens of thousands of students
p302
aVare grading each other's work,
p303
aVand quite successfully, I have to say.
p304
aa(lp305
VBut this is not just about students
p306
aVsitting alone in their living room working through problems.
p307
aVAround each one of our courses,
p308
aVa community of students had formed,
p309
aVa global community of people
p310
aVaround a shared intellectual endeavor.
p311
aVWhat you see here is a self-generated map
p312
aVfrom students in our Princeton Sociology 101 course,
p313
aVwhere they have put themselves on a world map,
p314
aVand you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort.
p315
aa(lp316
VStudents collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways.
p317
aVFirst of all, there was a question and answer forum,
p318
aVwhere students would pose questions,
p319
aVand other students would answer those questions.
p320
aVAnd the really amazing thing is,
p321
aVbecause there were so many students,
p322
aVit means that even if a student posed a question
p323
aVat 3 o'clock in the morning,
p324
aVsomewhere around the world,
p325
aVthere would be somebody who was awake
p326
aVand working on the same problem.
p327
aVAnd so, in many of our courses,
p328
aVthe median response time for a question
p329
aVon the question and answer forum was 22 minutes.
p330
aVWhich is not a level of service I have ever offered to my Stanford students.
p331
aa(lp332
V(Laughter)
p333
aa(lp334
VAnd you can see from the student testimonials
p335
aVthat students actually find
p336
aVthat because of this large online community,
p337
aVthey got to interact with each other in many ways
p338
aVthat were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom.
p339
aVStudents also self-assembled,
p340
aVwithout any kind of intervention from us,
p341
aVinto small study groups.
p342
aVSome of these were physical study groups
p343
aValong geographical constraints
p344
aVand met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets.
p345
aVThis is the San Francisco study group,
p346
aVbut there were ones all over the world.
p347
aVOthers were virtual study groups,
p348
aVsometimes along language lines or along cultural lines,
p349
aVand on the bottom left there,
p350
aVyou see our multicultural universal study group
p351
aVwhere people explicitly wanted to connect
p352
aVwith people from other cultures.
p353
aa(lp354
VThere are some tremendous opportunities
p355
aVto be had from this kind of framework.
p356
aVThe first is that it has the potential of giving us
p357
aVa completely unprecedented look
p358
aVinto understanding human learning.
p359
aVBecause the data that we can collect here is unique.
p360
aVYou can collect every click, every homework submission,
p361
aVevery forum post from tens of thousands of students.
p362
aVSo you can turn the study of human learning
p363
aVfrom the hypothesis-driven mode
p364
aVto the data-driven mode, a transformation that,
p365
aVfor example, has revolutionized biology.
p366
aVYou can use these data to understand fundamental questions
p367
aVlike, what are good learning strategies
p368
aVthat are effective versus ones that are not?
p369
aVAnd in the context of particular courses,
p370
aVyou can ask questions
p371
aVlike, what are some of the misconceptions that are more common
p372
aVand how do we help students fix them?
p373
aa(lp374
VSo here's an example of that,
p375
aValso from Andrew's Machine Learning class.
p376
aVThis is a distribution of wrong answers
p377
aVto one of Andrew's assignments.
p378
aVThe answers happen to be pairs of numbers,
p379
aVso you can draw them on this two-dimensional plot.
p380
aVEach of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer.
p381
aVThe big cross at the top left
p382
aVis where 2,000 students
p383
aVgave the exact same wrong answer.
p384
aVNow, if two students in a class of 100
p385
aVgive the same wrong answer,
p386
aVyou would never notice.
p387
aVBut when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer,
p388
aVit's kind of hard to miss.
p389
aVSo Andrew and his students went in,
p390
aVlooked at some of those assignments,
p391
aVunderstood the root cause of the misconception,
p392
aVand then they produced a targeted error message
p393
aVthat would be provided to every student
p394
aVwhose answer fell into that bucket,
p395
aVwhich means that students who made that same mistake
p396
aVwould now get personalized feedback
p397
aVtelling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively.
p398
aa(lp399
VSo this personalization is something that one can then build
p400
aVby having the virtue of large numbers.
p401
aVPersonalization is perhaps
p402
aVone of the biggest opportunities here as well,
p403
aVbecause it provides us with the potential
p404
aVof solving a 30-year-old problem.
p405
aVEducational researcher Benjamin Bloom, in 1984,
p406
aVposed what's called the 2 sigma problem,
p407
aVwhich he observed by studying three populations.
p408
aVThe first is the population that studied in a lecture-based classroom.
p409
aVThe second is a population of students that studied
p410
aVusing a standard lecture-based classroom,
p411
aVbut with a mastery-based approach,
p412
aVso the students couldn't move on to the next topic
p413
aVbefore demonstrating mastery of the previous one.
p414
aVAnd finally, there was a population of students
p415
aVthat were taught in a one-on-one instruction using a tutor.
p416
aVThe mastery-based population was a full standard deviation,
p417
aVor sigma, in achievement scores better
p418
aVthan the standard lecture-based class,
p419
aVand the individual tutoring gives you 2 sigma
p420
aVimprovement in performance.
p421
aa(lp422
VTo understand what that means,
p423
aVlet's look at the lecture-based classroom,
p424
aVand let's pick the median performance as a threshold.
p425
aVSo in a lecture-based class,
p426
aVhalf the students are above that level and half are below.
p427
aVIn the individual tutoring instruction,
p428
aV98 percent of the students are going to be above that threshold.
p429
aVImagine if we could teach so that 98 percent of our students
p430
aVwould be above average.
p431
aVHence, the 2 sigma problem.
p432
aa(lp433
VBecause we cannot afford, as a society,
p434
aVto provide every student with an individual human tutor.
p435
aVBut maybe we can afford to provide each student
p436
aVwith a computer or a smartphone.
p437
aVSo the question is, how can we use technology
p438
aVto push from the left side of the graph, from the blue curve,
p439
aVto the right side with the green curve?
p440
aVMastery is easy to achieve using a computer,
p441
aVbecause a computer doesn't get tired
p442
aVof showing you the same video five times.
p443
aVAnd it doesn't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times,
p444
aVwe've seen that in many of the examples that I've shown you.
p445
aVAnd even personalization
p446
aVis something that we're starting to see the beginnings of,
p447
aVwhether it's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum
p448
aVor some of the personalized feedback that we've shown you.
p449
aVSo the goal here is to try and push,
p450
aVand see how far we can get towards the green curve.
p451
aa(lp452
VSo, if this is so great, are universities now obsolete?
p453
aVWell, Mark Twain certainly thought so.
p454
aVHe said that, "College is a place where a professor's lecture notes
p455

p456
aVwithout passing through the brains of either."

VI beg to differ with Mark Twain, though.
p461
aVI think what he was complaining about is not
p462
aVuniversities but rather the lecture-based format
p463
aVthat so many universities spend so much time on.
p464
aVSo let's go back even further, to Plutarch,
p465
aVwho said that, "The mind is not a vessel that needs filling,
p466
aVbut wood that needs igniting."
p467
aVAnd maybe we should spend less time at universities
p468
aVfilling our students' minds with content
p469
aVby lecturing at them, and more time igniting their creativity,
p470
aVtheir imagination and their problem-solving skills
p471
aVby actually talking with them.
p472
aa(lp473
VSo how do we do that?
p474
aVWe do that by doing active learning in the classroom.
p475
aVSo there's been many studies, including this one,
p476
aVthat show that if you use active learning,
p477
aVinteracting with your students in the classroom,
p478
aVperformance improves on every single metric \u2014
p479
aVon attendance, on engagement and on learning
p480
aVas measured by a standardized test.
p481
aVYou can see, for example, that the achievement score
p482
aValmost doubles in this particular experiment.
p483
aVSo maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities.
p484
aa(lp485
VSo to summarize, if we could offer a top quality education
p486
aVto everyone around the world for free,
p487
aVwhat would that do? Three things.
p488
aVFirst it would establish education as a fundamental human right,
p489
aVwhere anyone around the world
p490
aVwith the ability and the motivation
p491
aVcould get the skills that they need
p492
aVto make a better life for themselves,
p493
aVtheir families and their communities.
p494
aa(lp495
VSecond, it would enable lifelong learning.
p496
aVIt's a shame that for so many people,
p497
aVlearning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college.
p498
aVBy having this amazing content be available,
p499
aVwe would be able to learn something new
p500
aVevery time we wanted,
p501
aVwhether it's just to expand our minds
p502
aVor it's to change our lives.
p503
aa(lp504
VAnd finally, this would enable a wave of innovation,
p505
aVbecause amazing talent can be found anywhere.
p506
aVMaybe the next Albert Einstein or the next Steve Jobs
p507
aVis living somewhere in a remote village in Africa.
p508
aVAnd if we could offer that person an education,
p509
aVthey would be able to come up with the next big idea
p510
aVand make the world a better place for all of us.
p511
