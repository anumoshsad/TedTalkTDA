VI would like to share with you today
p4
aVa project that has changed how I approach
p5
aVand practice architecture:
p6
aVthe Fez River Rehabilitation Project.
p7
aa(lp8
VMy hometown of Fez, Morocco,
p9
aVboasts one of the largest walled medieval cities in the world,
p10
aVcalled the medina, nestled in a river valley.
p11
aVThe entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
p12
aVSince the 1950s, as the population of the medina grew,
p13
aVbasic urban infrastructure
p14
aVsuch as green open spaces and sewage
p15
aVquickly changed and got highly stressed.
p16
aVOne of the biggest casualties of the situation
p17
aVwas the Fez River, which bisects the medina in its middle
p18
aVand has been considered for many centuries
p19
aVas the city's very soul.
p20
aVIn fact, one can witness the presence
p21
aVof the river's extensive water network
p22
aVall throughout the city,
p23
aVin places such as private and public fountains.
p24
aa(lp25
VUnfortunately, because of the pollution of the river,
p26
aVit has been covered little by little
p27
aVby concrete slabs since 1952.
p28
aVThis process of erasure was coupled
p29
aVwith the destruction of many houses
p30
aValong the river banks
p31
aVto be able to make machineries
p32
aVenter the narrow pedestrian network of the medina.
p33
aVThose urban voids quickly became illegal parking
p34
aVor trash yards.
p35
aVActually, the state of the river
p36
aVbefore entering the medina is pretty healthy.
p37
aVThen pollution takes its toll,
p38
aVmainly due to untreated sewage
p39
aVand chemical dumping from crafts such as tanning.
p40
aVAt some point, I couldn't bear
p41
aVthe desecration of the river,
p42
aVsuch an important part of my city,
p43
aVand I decided to take action,
p44
aVespecially after I heard that the city
p45
aVreceived a grant to divert sewage water
p46
aVand to treat it.
p47
aa(lp48
VWith clean water, suddenly
p49
aVthe uncovering of the river became possible,
p50
aVand with luck and actually a lot of pushing,
p51
aVmy partner Takako Tajima and I
p52
aVwere commissioned by the city to work with a team of engineers
p53
aVto uncover the river.
p54
aVHowever, we were sneaky,
p55
aVand we proposed more:
p56
aVto convert riverbanks into pedestrian pathways,
p57
aVand then to connect these pathways
p58
aVback to the city fabric,
p59
aVand finally to convert the urban voids
p60
aValong the riverbanks into public spaces
p61
aVthat are lacking in the Medina of Fez.
p62
aVI will show you briefly now
p63
aVtwo of these public spaces.
p64
aa(lp65
VThe first one is the Rcif Plaza,
p66
aVwhich sits actually right on top of the river,
p67
aVwhich you can see here in dotted lines.
p68
aVThis plaza used to be a chaotic transportation hub
p69
aVthat actually compromised the urban integrity
p70
aVof the medina, that has the largest
p71
aVpedestrian network in the world.
p72
aVAnd right beyond the historic bridge that you can see here,
p73
aVright next to the plaza,
p74
aVyou can see that the river looked like
p75
aVa river of trash.
p76
aVInstead, what we proposed is to make
p77
aVthe plaza entirely pedestrian,
p78
aVto cover it with recycled leather canopies,
p79
aVand to connect it to the banks of the river.
p80
aa(lp81
VThe second site of intervention
p82
aVis also an urban void along the river banks,
p83
aVand it used to be an illegal parking,
p84
aVand we proposed to transform it
p85
aVinto the first playground in the medina.
p86
aVThe playground is constructed using recycled tires
p87
aVand also is coupled with a constructed wetland
p88
aVthat not only cleans the water of the river
p89
aVbut also retains it when floods occur.
p90
aa(lp91
VAs the project progressed and received several design awards,
p92
aVnew stakeholders intervened
p93
aVand changed the project goals and design.
p94
aVThe only way for us to be able to bring
p95
aVthe main goals of the project ahead
p96
aVwas for us to do something very unusual
p97
aVthat usually architects don't do.
p98
aVIt was for us to take our design ego
p99
aVand our sense of authorship
p100
aVand put it in the backseat
p101
aVand to focus mainly on being activists
p102
aVand on trying to coalesce
p103
aVall of the agendas of stakeholders
p104
aVand focus on the main goals of the project:
p105
aVthat is, to uncover the river, treat its water,
p106
aVand provide public spaces for all.
p107
aVWe were actually very lucky,
p108
aVand many of those goals happened
p109
aVor are in the process of happening.
p110
aVLike, you can see here in the Rcif Plaza.
p111
aVThis is how it looked like about six years ago.
p112
aVThis is how it looks like today.
p113
aVIt's still under construction,
p114
aVbut actually it is heavily used
p115
aVby the local population.
p116
aVAnd finally, this is how the Rcif Plaza will look like
p117
aVwhen the project is completed.
p118
aVThis is the river, covered, used as a trash yard.
p119
aVThen after many years of work,
p120
aVthe river with clean water, uncovered.
p121
aVAnd finally, you can see here the river
p122
aVwhen the project will be completed.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo for sure, the Fez River Rehabilitation
p125
aVwill keep on changing and adapting
p126
aVto the sociopolitical landscape of the city,
p127
aVbut we strongly believe that by reimagining
p128
aVthe role and the agency of the architect,
p129
aVwe have set up the core idea of the project into motion;
p130
aVthat is, to transform the river from sewage
p131
aVto public space for all,
p132
aVthereby making sure that the city of Fez
p133
aVwill remain a living city for its inhabitants
p134
aVrather than a mummified heritage.
p135
