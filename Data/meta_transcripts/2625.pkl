VChris Anderson: So, Jon, this feels scary.
p4
aa(lp5
VJonathan Haidt: Yeah.
p6
aa(lp7
VCA: It feels like the world is in a place
p8
aVthat we haven't seen for a long time.
p9
aVPeople don't just disagree in the way that we're familiar with,
p10
aVon the left-right political divide.
p11
aVThere are much deeper differences afoot.
p12
aVWhat on earth is going on, and how did we get here?
p13
aa(lp14
VJH: This is different.
p15
aVThere's a much more apocalyptic sort of feeling.
p16
aVSurvey research by Pew Research shows
p17
aVthat the degree to which we feel that the other side is not just \u2014
p18
aVwe don't just dislike them; we strongly dislike them,
p19
aVand we think that they are a threat to the nation.
p20
aVThose numbers have been going up and up,
p21
aVand those are over 50 percent now on both sides.
p22
aVPeople are scared,
p23
aVbecause it feels like this is different than before; it's much more intense.
p24
aa(lp25
VWhenever I look at any sort of social puzzle,
p26
aVI always apply the three basic principles of moral psychology,
p27
aVand I think they'll help us here.
p28
aVSo the first thing that you have to always keep in mind
p29
aVwhen you're thinking about politics
p30
aVis that we're tribal.
p31
aVWe evolved for tribalism.
p32
aVOne of the simplest and greatest insights into human social nature
p33
aVis the Bedouin proverb:
p34
aV"Me against my brother;
p35
aVme and my brother against our cousin;
p36
aVme and my brother and cousins against the stranger."
p37
aVAnd that tribalism allowed us to create large societies
p38
aVand to come together in order to compete with others.
p39
aVThat brought us out of the jungle and out of small groups,
p40
aVbut it means that we have eternal conflict.
p41
aVThe question you have to look at is:
p42
aVWhat aspects of our society are making that more bitter,
p43
aVand what are calming them down?
p44
aa(lp45
VCA: That's a very dark proverb.
p46
aVYou're saying that that's actually baked into most people's mental wiring
p47
aVat some level?
p48
aa(lp49
VJH: Oh, absolutely. This is just a basic aspect of human social cognition.
p50
aVBut we can also live together really peacefully,
p51
aVand we've invented all kinds of fun ways of, like, playing war.
p52
aVI mean, sports, politics \u2014
p53
aVthese are all ways that we get to exercise this tribal nature
p54
aVwithout actually hurting anyone.
p55
aVWe're also really good at trade and exploration and meeting new people.
p56
aVSo you have to see our tribalism as something that goes up or down \u2014
p57
aVit's not like we're doomed to always be fighting each other,
p58
aVbut we'll never have world peace.
p59
aa(lp60
VCA: The size of that tribe can shrink or expand.
p61
aa(lp62
VJH: Right.
p63
aa(lp64
VCA: The size of what we consider "us"
p65
aVand what we consider "other" or "them"
p66
aVcan change.
p67
aVAnd some people believed that process could continue indefinitely.
p68
aa(lp69
VJH: That's right.
p70
aa(lp71
VCA: And we were indeed expanding the sense of tribe for a while.
p72
aa(lp73
VJH: So this is, I think,
p74
aVwhere we're getting at what's possibly the new left-right distinction.
p75
aVI mean, the left-right as we've all inherited it,
p76
aVcomes out of the labor versus capital distinction,
p77
aVand the working class, and Marx.
p78
aVBut I think what we're seeing now, increasingly,
p79
aVis a divide in all the Western democracies
p80
aVbetween the people who want to stop at nation,
p81
aVthe people who are more parochial \u2014
p82
aVand I don't mean that in a bad way \u2014
p83
aVpeople who have much more of a sense of being rooted,
p84
aVthey care about their town, their community and their nation.
p85
aVAnd then those who are anti-parochial and who \u2014
p86
aVwhenever I get confused, I just think of the John Lennon song "Imagine."
p87
aV"Imagine there's no countries, nothing to kill or die for."
p88
aVAnd so these are the people who want more global governance,
p89
aVthey don't like nation states, they don't like borders.
p90
aVYou see this all over Europe as well.
p91
aVThere's a great metaphor guy \u2014 actually, his name is Shakespeare \u2014
p92
aVwriting ten years ago in Britain.
p93
aVHe had a metaphor:
p94
aV"Are we drawbridge-uppers or drawbridge-downers?"
p95
aVAnd Britain is divided 52-48 on that point.
p96
aVAnd America is divided on that point, too.
p97
aa(lp98
VCA: And so, those of us who grew up with The Beatles
p99
aVand that sort of hippie philosophy of dreaming of a more connected world \u2014
p100
aVit felt so idealistic and "how could anyone think badly about that?"
p101
aVAnd what you're saying is that, actually,
p102
aVmillions of people today feel that that isn't just silly;
p103
aVit's actually dangerous and wrong, and they're scared of it.
p104
aa(lp105
VJH: I think the big issue, especially in Europe but also here,
p106
aVis the issue of immigration.
p107
aVAnd I think this is where we have to look very carefully
p108
aVat the social science about diversity and immigration.
p109
aVOnce something becomes politicized,
p110
aVonce it becomes something that the left loves and the right \u2014
p111
aVthen even the social scientists can't think straight about it.
p112
aVNow, diversity is good in a lot of ways.
p113
aVIt clearly creates more innovation.
p114
aVThe American economy has grown enormously from it.
p115
aVDiversity and immigration do a lot of good things.
p116
aVBut what the globalists, I think, don't see,
p117
aVwhat they don't want to see,
p118
aVis that ethnic diversity cuts social capital and trust.
p119
aa(lp120
VThere's a very important study by Robert Putnam,
p121
aVthe author of "Bowling Alone,"
p122
aVlooking at social capital databases.
p123
aVAnd basically, the more people feel that they are the same,
p124
aVthe more they trust each other,
p125
aVthe more they can have a redistributionist welfare state.
p126
aVScandinavian countries are so wonderful
p127
aVbecause they have this legacy of being small, homogenous countries.
p128
aVAnd that leads to a progressive welfare state,
p129
aVa set of progressive left-leaning values, which says,
p130
aV"Drawbridge down! The world is a great place.
p131
aVPeople in Syria are suffering \u2014 we must welcome them in."
p132
aVAnd it's a beautiful thing.
p133
aVBut if, and I was in Sweden this summer,
p134
aVif the discourse in Sweden is fairly politically correct
p135
aVand they can't talk about the downsides,
p136
aVyou end up bringing a lot of people in.
p137
aVThat's going to cut social capital,
p138
aVit makes it hard to have a welfare state
p139
aVand they might end up, as we have in America,
p140
aVwith a racially divided, visibly racially divided, society.
p141
aVSo this is all very uncomfortable to talk about.
p142
aVBut I think this is the thing, especially in Europe and for us, too,
p143
aVwe need to be looking at.
p144
aa(lp145
VCA: You're saying that people of reason,
p146
aVpeople who would consider themselves not racists,
p147
aVbut moral, upstanding people,
p148
aVhave a rationale that says humans are just too different;
p149
aVthat we're in danger of overloading our sense of what humans are capable of,
p150
aVby mixing in people who are too different.
p151
aa(lp152
VJH: Yes, but I can make it much more palatable
p153
aVby saying it's not necessarily about race.
p154
aVIt's about culture.
p155
aVThere's wonderful work by a political scientist named Karen Stenner,
p156
aVwho shows that when people have a sense
p157
aVthat we are all united, we're all the same,
p158
aVthere are many people who have a predisposition to authoritarianism.
p159
aVThose people aren't particularly racist
p160
aVwhen they feel as through there's not a threat
p161
aVto our social and moral order.
p162
aVBut if you prime them experimentally
p163
aVby thinking we're coming apart, people are getting more different,
p164
aVthen they get more racist, homophobic, they want to kick out the deviants.
p165
aVSo it's in part that you get an authoritarian reaction.
p166
aVThe left, following through the Lennonist line \u2014
p167
aVthe John Lennon line \u2014
p168
aVdoes things that create an authoritarian reaction.
p169
aa(lp170
VWe're certainly seeing that in America with the alt-right.
p171
aVWe saw it in Britain, we've seen it all over Europe.
p172
aVBut the more positive part of that
p173
aVis that I think the localists, or the nationalists, are actually right \u2014
p174
aVthat, if you emphasize our cultural similarity,
p175
aVthen race doesn't actually matter very much.
p176
aVSo an assimilationist approach to immigration
p177
aVremoves a lot of these problems.
p178
aVAnd if you value having a generous welfare state,
p179
aVyou've got to emphasize that we're all the same.
p180
aa(lp181
VCA: OK, so rising immigration and fears about that
p182
aVare one of the causes of the current divide.
p183
aVWhat are other causes?
p184
aa(lp185
VJH: The next principle of moral psychology
p186
aVis that intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second.
p187
aVYou've probably heard the term "motivated reasoning"
p188
aVor "confirmation bias."
p189
aVThere's some really interesting work
p190
aVon how our high intelligence and our verbal abilities
p191
aVmight have evolved not to help us find out the truth,
p192
aVbut to help us manipulate each other, defend our reputation ...
p193
aVWe're really, really good at justifying ourselves.
p194
aVAnd when you bring group interests into account,
p195
aVso it's not just me, it's my team versus your team,
p196
aVwhereas if you're evaluating evidence that your side is wrong,
p197
aVwe just can't accept that.
p198
aVSo this is why you can't win a political argument.
p199
aVIf you're debating something,
p200
aVyou can't persuade the person with reasons and evidence,
p201
aVbecause that's not the way reasoning works.
p202
aVSo now, give us the internet, give us Google:
p203
aV"I heard that Barack Obama was born in Kenya.
p204
aVLet me Google that \u2014 oh my God! 10 million hits! Look, he was!"
p205
aa(lp206
VCA: So this has come as an unpleasant surprise to a lot of people.
p207
aVSocial media has often been framed by techno-optimists
p208
aVas this great connecting force that would bring people together.
p209
aVAnd there have been some unexpected counter-effects to that.
p210
aa(lp211
VJH: That's right.
p212
aVThat's why I'm very enamored of yin-yang views
p213
aVof human nature and left-right \u2014
p214
aVthat each side is right about certain things,
p215
aVbut then it goes blind to other things.
p216
aVAnd so the left generally believes that human nature is good:
p217
aVbring people together, knock down the walls and all will be well.
p218
aVThe right \u2014 social conservatives, not libertarians \u2014
p219
aVsocial conservatives generally believe people can be greedy
p220
aVand sexual and selfish,
p221
aVand we need regulation, and we need restrictions.
p222
aVSo, yeah, if you knock down all the walls,
p223
aVallow people to communicate all over the world,
p224
aVyou get a lot of porn and a lot of racism.
p225
aa(lp226
VCA: So help us understand.
p227
aVThese principles of human nature have been with us forever.
p228
aVWhat's changed that's deepened this feeling of division?
p229
aa(lp230
VJH: You have to see six to ten different threads all coming together.
p231
aVI'll just list a couple of them.
p232
aVSo in America, one of the big \u2014 actually, America and Europe \u2014
p233
aVone of the biggest ones is World War II.
p234
aVThere's interesting research from Joe Henrich and others
p235
aVthat says if your country was at war,
p236
aVespecially when you were young,
p237
aVthen we test you 30 years later in a commons dilemma
p238
aVor a prisoner's dilemma,
p239
aVyou're more cooperative.
p240
aVBecause of our tribal nature, if you're \u2014
p241
aVmy parents were teenagers during World War II,
p242
aVand they would go out looking for scraps of aluminum
p243
aVto help the war effort.
p244
aVI mean, everybody pulled together.
p245
aVAnd so then these people go on,
p246
aVthey rise up through business and government,
p247
aVthey take leadership positions.
p248
aVThey're really good at compromise and cooperation.
p249
aVThey all retire by the '90s.
p250
aVSo we're left with baby boomers by the end of the '90s.
p251
aVAnd their youth was spent fighting each other within each country,
p252
aVin 1968 and afterwards.
p253
aVThe loss of the World War II generation, "The Greatest Generation,"
p254
aVis huge.
p255
aVSo that's one.
p256
aa(lp257
VAnother, in America, is the purification of the two parties.
p258
aVThere used to be liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats.
p259
aVSo America had a mid-20th century that was really bipartisan.
p260
aVBut because of a variety of factors that started things moving,
p261
aVby the 90's, we had a purified liberal party and conservative party.
p262
aVSo now, the people in either party really are different,
p263
aVand we really don't want our children to marry them,
p264
aVwhich, in the '60s, didn't matter very much.
p265
aVSo, the purification of the parties.
p266
aVThird is the internet and, as I said,
p267
aVit's just the most amazing stimulant for post-hoc reasoning and demonization.
p268
aa(lp269
VCA: The tone of what's happening on the internet now is quite troubling.
p270
aVI just did a quick search on Twitter about the election
p271
aVand saw two tweets next to each other.
p272
aVOne, against a picture of racist graffiti:
p273
aV"This is disgusting!
p274
aVUgliness in this country, brought to us by #Trump."
p275
aVAnd then the next one is:
p276
aV"Crooked Hillary dedication page. Disgusting!"
p277
aVSo this idea of "disgust" is troubling to me.
p278
aVBecause you can have an argument or a disagreement about something,
p279
aVyou can get angry at someone.
p280
aVDisgust, I've heard you say, takes things to a much deeper level.
p281
aa(lp282
VJH: That's right. Disgust is different.
p283
aVAnger \u2014 you know, I have kids.
p284
aVThey fight 10 times a day,
p285
aVand they love each other 30 times a day.
p286
aVYou just go back and forth: you get angry, you're not angry;
p287
aVyou're angry, you're not angry.
p288
aVBut disgust is different.
p289
aVDisgust paints the person as subhuman, monstrous,
p290
aVdeformed, morally deformed.
p291
aVDisgust is like indelible ink.
p292
aVThere's research from John Gottman on marital therapy.
p293
aVIf you look at the faces \u2014 if one of the couple shows disgust or contempt,
p294
aVthat's a predictor that they're going to get divorced soon,
p295
aVwhereas if they show anger, that doesn't predict anything,
p296
aVbecause if you deal with anger well, it actually is good.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo this election is different.
p299
aVDonald Trump personally uses the word "disgust" a lot.
p300
aVHe's very germ-sensitive, so disgust does matter a lot \u2014
p301
aVmore for him, that's something unique to him \u2014
p302
aVbut as we demonize each other more,
p303
aVand again, through the Manichaean worldview,
p304
aVthe idea that the world is a battle between good and evil
p305
aVas this has been ramping up,
p306
aVwe're more likely not just to say they're wrong or I don't like them,
p307
aVbut we say they're evil, they're satanic,
p308
aVthey're disgusting, they're revolting.
p309
aVAnd then we want nothing to do with them.
p310
aVAnd that's why I think we're seeing it, for example, on campus now.
p311
aVWe're seeing more the urge to keep people off campus,
p312
aVsilence them, keep them away.
p313
aVI'm afraid that this whole generation of young people,
p314
aVif their introduction to politics involves a lot of disgust,
p315
aVthey're not going to want to be involved in politics as they get older.
p316
aa(lp317
VCA: So how do we deal with that?
p318
aVDisgust. How do you defuse disgust?
p319
aa(lp320
VJH: You can't do it with reasons.
p321
aVI think ...
p322
aVI studied disgust for many years, and I think about emotions a lot.
p323
aVAnd I think that the opposite of disgust is actually love.
p324
aVLove is all about, like ...
p325
aVDisgust is closing off, borders.
p326
aVLove is about dissolving walls.
p327
aVSo personal relationships, I think,
p328
aVare probably the most powerful means we have.
p329
aVYou can be disgusted by a group of people,
p330
aVbut then you meet a particular person
p331
aVand you genuinely discover that they're lovely.
p332
aVAnd then gradually that chips away or changes your category as well.
p333
aVThe tragedy is, Americans used to be much more mixed up in the their towns
p334
aVby left-right or politics.
p335
aVAnd now that it's become this great moral divide,
p336
aVthere's a lot of evidence that we're moving to be near people
p337
aVwho are like us politically.
p338
aVIt's harder to find somebody who's on the other side.
p339
aVSo they're over there, they're far away.
p340
aVIt's harder to get to know them.
p341
aa(lp342
VCA: What would you say to someone or say to Americans,
p343
aVpeople generally,
p344
aVabout what we should understand about each other
p345
aVthat might help us rethink for a minute
p346
aVthis "disgust" instinct?
p347
aa(lp348
VJH: Yes.
p349
aVA really important thing to keep in mind \u2014
p350
aVthere's research by political scientist Alan Abramowitz,
p351
aVshowing that American democracy is increasingly governed
p352
aVby what's called "negative partisanship."
p353
aVThat means you think, OK there's a candidate,
p354
aVyou like the candidate, you vote for the candidate.
p355
aVBut with the rise of negative advertising
p356
aVand social media and all sorts of other trends,
p357
aVincreasingly, the way elections are done
p358
aVis that each side tries to make the other side so horrible, so awful,
p359
aVthat you'll vote for my guy by default.
p360
aa(lp361
VAnd so as we more and more vote against the other side
p362
aVand not for our side,
p363
aVyou have to keep in mind that if people are on the left,
p364
aVthey think, "Well, I used to think that Republicans were bad,
p365
aVbut now Donald Trump proves it.
p366
aVAnd now every Republican, I can paint with all the things
p367
aVthat I think about Trump."
p368
aVAnd that's not necessarily true.
p369
aVThey're generally not very happy with their candidate.
p370
aa(lp371
VThis is the most negative partisanship election in American history.
p372
aVSo you have to first separate your feelings about the candidate
p373
aVfrom your feelings about the people who are given a choice.
p374
aVAnd then you have to realize that,
p375
aVbecause we all live in a separate moral world \u2014
p376
aVthe metaphor I use in the book is that we're all trapped in "The Matrix,"
p377
aVor each moral community is a matrix, a consensual hallucination.
p378
aVAnd so if you're within the blue matrix,
p379
aVeverything's completely compelling that the other side \u2014
p380
aVthey're troglodytes, they're racists, they're the worst people in the world,
p381
aVand you have all the facts to back that up.
p382
aVBut somebody in the next house from yours
p383
aVis living in a different moral matrix.
p384
aVThey live in a different video game,
p385
aVand they see a completely different set of facts.
p386
aVAnd each one sees different threats to the country.
p387
aVAnd what I've found from being in the middle
p388
aVand trying to understand both sides is: both sides are right.
p389
aVThere are a lot of threats to this country,
p390
aVand each side is constitutionally incapable of seeing them all.
p391
aa(lp392
VCA: So, are you saying that we almost need a new type of empathy?
p393
aVEmpathy is traditionally framed as:
p394
aV"Oh, I feel your pain. I can put myself in your shoes."
p395
aVAnd we apply it to the poor, the needy, the suffering.
p396
aVWe don't usually apply it to people who we feel as other,
p397
aVor we're disgusted by.
p398
aa(lp399
VJH: No. That's right.
p400
aa(lp401
VCA: What would it look like to build that type of empathy?
p402
aa(lp403
VJH: Actually, I think ...
p404
aVEmpathy is a very, very hot topic in psychology,
p405
aVand it's a very popular word on the left in particular.
p406
aVEmpathy is a good thing, and empathy for the preferred classes of victims.
p407
aVSo it's important to empathize
p408
aVwith the groups that we on the left think are so important.
p409
aVThat's easy to do, because you get points for that.
p410
aa(lp411
VBut empathy really should get you points if you do it when it's hard to do.
p412
aVAnd, I think ...
p413
aVYou know, we had a long 50-year period of dealing with our race problems
p414
aVand legal discrimination,
p415
aVand that was our top priority for a long time
p416
aVand it still is important.
p417
aVBut I think this year,
p418
aVI'm hoping it will make people see
p419
aVthat we have an existential threat on our hands.
p420
aVOur left-right divide, I believe,
p421
aVis by far the most important divide we face.
p422
aVWe still have issues about race and gender and LGBT,
p423
aVbut this is the urgent need of the next 50 years,

aVand things aren't going to get better on their own.
p425
aVSo we're going to need to do a lot of institutional reforms,
p426
aVand we could talk about that,
p427
aVbut that's like a whole long, wonky conversation.
p428
aVBut I think it starts with people realizing that this is a turning point.
p429
aVAnd yes, we need a new kind of empathy.
p430
aVWe need to realize:
p431
aVthis is what our country needs,
p432
aVand this is what you need if you don't want to \u2014
p433
aVRaise your hand if you want to spend the next four years
p434
aVas angry and worried as you've been for the last year \u2014 raise your hand.
p435
aVSo if you want to escape from this,
p436
aVread Buddha, read Jesus, read Marcus Aurelius.
p437
aVThey have all kinds of great advice for how to drop the fear,
p438
aVreframe things,
p439
aVstop seeing other people as your enemy.
p440
aVThere's a lot of guidance in ancient wisdom for this kind of empathy.

VCA: Here's my last question:
p443
aVPersonally, what can people do to help heal?
p444
aa(lp445
VJH: Yeah, it's very hard to just decide to overcome your deepest prejudices.
p446
aVAnd there's research showing
p447
aVthat political prejudices are deeper and stronger than race prejudices
p448
aVin the country now.
p449
aVSo I think you have to make an effort \u2014 that's the main thing.
p450
aVMake an effort to actually meet somebody.
p451
aVEverybody has a cousin, a brother-in-law,
p452
aVsomebody who's on the other side.
p453
aVSo, after this election \u2014
p454
aVwait a week or two,
p455
aVbecause it's probably going to feel awful for one of you \u2014
p456
aVbut wait a couple weeks, and then reach out and say you want to talk.
p457
aVAnd before you do it,
p458
aVread Dale Carnegie, "How to Win Friends and Influence People" \u2014
p459
aa(lp460
V(Laughter)
p461
aa(lp462
VI'm totally serious.
p463
aVYou'll learn techniques if you start by acknowledging,
p464
aVif you start by saying,
p465
aV"You know, we don't agree on a lot,
p466
aVbut one thing I really respect about you, Uncle Bob,"
p467
aVor "... about you conservatives, is ... "
p468
aVAnd you can find something.
p469
aVIf you start with some appreciation, it's like magic.
p470
aVThis is one of the main things I've learned
p471
aVthat I take into my human relationships.
p472
aVI still make lots of stupid mistakes,
p473
aVbut I'm incredibly good at apologizing now,
p474
aVand at acknowledging what somebody was right about.
p475
aVAnd if you do that,
p476
aVthen the conversation goes really well, and it's actually really fun.
p477
aa(lp478
VCA: Jon, it's absolutely fascinating speaking with you.
p479
aVIt really does feel like the ground that we're on
p480
aVis a ground populated by deep questions of morality and human nature.
p481
aVYour wisdom couldn't be more relevant.
p482
aVThank you so much for sharing this time with us.
