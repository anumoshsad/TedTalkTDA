VIn the past several days, I heard people talking about China.
p4
aVAnd also, I talked to friends about China and Chinese Internet.
p5
aVSomething is very challenging to me.
p6
aVI want to make my friends understand:
p7
aVChina is complicated.
p8
aVSo I always want to tell the story, like,
p9
aVone hand it is that, the other hand is that.
p10
aVYou can't just tell a one sided story.
p11
aVI'll give an example. China is a BRIC country.
p12
aVBRIC country means Brazil, Russia, India and China.
p13
aVThis emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy.
p14
aVBut at the same time, on the other hand,
p15
aVChina is a SICK country,
p16
aVthe terminology coined by Facebook IPO papers \u2014 file.
p17
aVHe said the SICK country means Syria, Iran, China and North Korea.
p18
aVThe four countries have no access to Facebook.
p19
aVSo basically, China is a SICK BRIC country.
p20
aa(lp21
V(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VAnother project was built up
p24
aVto watch China and Chinese Internet.
p25
aVAnd now, today I want to tell you my personal
p26
aVobservation in the past several years, from that wall.
p27
aVSo, if you are a fan of the Game of Thrones,
p28
aVyou definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom.
p29
aVIt prevents weird things from the north.
p30
aa(lp31
VSame was true for China.
p32
aVIn the north, there was a great wall, Chang Cheng.
p33
aVIt protected China from invaders for 2,000 years.
p34
aVBut China also has a great firewall.
p35
aVThat's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world.
p36
aVIt's not only to defend the Chinese regime from overseas,
p37
aVfrom the universal values, but also to prevent
p38
aVChina's own citizens to access the global free Internet,
p39
aVand even separate themselves into blocks, not united.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo, basically the "Internet" has two Internets.
p42
aVOne is the Internet, the other is the Chinanet.
p43
aVBut if you think the Chinanet is something
p44
aVlike a deadland, wasteland, I think it's wrong.
p45
aVBut we also use a very simple metaphor, the cat and the mouse game,
p46
aVto describe in the past 15 years
p47
aVthe continuing fight between Chinese
p48
aVcensorship, government censorship, the cat,
p49
aVand the Chinese Internet users. That means us, the mouse.
p50
aVBut sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo today I want to upgrade it to 2.0 version.
p53
aVIn China, we have 500 million Internet users.
p54
aVThat's the biggest population of Netizens, Internet users, in the whole world.
p55
aVSo even though China's is a totally censored Internet,
p56
aVbut still, Chinese Internet society is really booming.
p57
aVHow to make it? It's simple.
p58
aVYou have Google, we have Baidu.
p59
aVYou have Twitter, we have Weibo.
p60
aVYou have Facebook, we have Renren.
p61
aVYou have YouTube, we have Youku and Tudou.
p62
aVThe Chinese government blocked every
p63
aVsingle international Web 2.0 service,
p64
aVand we Chinese copycat every one.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VSo, that's the kind of the thing I call smart censorship.
p69
aVThat's not only to censor you.
p70
aVSometimes this Chinese national Internet policy is very simple:
p71
aVBlock and clone.
p72
aVOn the one hand, he wants to satisfy people's need of a social network,
p73
aVwhich is very important; people really love social networking.
p74
aVBut on the other hand, they want to keep the server
p75
aVin Beijing so they can access the data any time they want.
p76
aVThat's also the reason Google was pulled out from China,
p77
aVbecause they can't accept the fact
p78
aVthat Chinese government wants to keep the server.
p79
aa(lp80
VSometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands.
p81
aVFor example, Mubarak, he shut down the Internet.
p82
aVHe wanted to prevent the Netizens [from criticizing] him.
p83
aVBut once Netizens can't go online, they go in the street.
p84
aVAnd now the result is very simple.
p85
aVWe all know Mubarak is technically dead.
p86
aVBut also, Ben Ali, Tunisian president,
p87
aVdidn't follow the second rule.
p88
aVThat means keep the server in your hands.
p89
aVHe allowed Facebook, a U.S.-based service,
p90
aVto continue to stay on inside of Tunisia.
p91
aVSo he can't prevent it, his own citizens to post
p92
aVcritical videos against his corruption.
p93
aVThe same thing happend. He was the first
p94
aVto topple during the Arab Spring.
p95
aa(lp96
VBut those two very smart international censorship policies
p97
aVdidn't prevent Chinese social media [from] becoming a really public sphere,
p98
aVa pathway of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials.
p99
aVBecause we have 300 million microbloggers in China.
p100
aVIt's the entire population of the United States.
p101
aVSo when these 300 million people, microbloggers,
p102
aVeven they block the tweet in our censored platform.
p103
aVBut itself \u2014 the Chinanet \u2014 but itself can create
p104
aVvery powerful energy, which has never happened
p105
aVin the Chinese history.
p106
aa(lp107
V2011, in July, two [unclear] trains crashed,
p108
aVin Wenzhou, a southern city.
p109
aVRight after the train crash,
p110
aVauthorities literally wanted to cover up the train, bury the train.
p111
aVSo it angered the Chinese Netizens.
p112
aVThe first five days after the train crash,
p113
aVthere were 10 million criticisms of the posting
p114
aVon social media, which never happened in Chinese history.
p115
aVAnd later this year, the rail minister
p116
aVwas sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years.
p117
aa(lp118
VAnd also, recently, very funny debate between
p119
aVthe Beijing Environment Ministry
p120
aVand the American Embassy in Beijing
p121
aVbecause the Ministry blamed
p122
aVthe American Embassy for intervening in
p123
aVChinese internal politics by disclosing
p124
aVthe air quality data of Beijing.
p125
aVSo, the up is the Embassy data, the PM 2.5.
p126
aVHe showed 148, they showed it's dangerous for the sensitive group.
p127
aVSo a suggestion, it's not good to go outside.
p128
aVBut that is the Ministry's data. He shows 50.
p129
aVHe says it's good. It's good to go outside.
p130
aVBut 99 percent of Chinese microbloggers
p131
aVstand firmly on the Embassy's side.
p132
aVI live in Beijing. Every day, I just watch
p133
aVthe American Embassy's data to decide whether I should open my window.
p134
aa(lp135
VWhy is Chinese social networking, even within the censorship,
p136
aVso booming? Part of the reason is Chinese languages.
p137
aVYou know, Twitter and Twitter clones have a kind of
p138
aVa limitation of 140 characters.
p139
aVBut in English it's 20 words or a sentence with a short link.
p140
aVMaybe in Germany, in German language, it may be just "Aha!"
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VBut in Chinese language, it's really about 140 characters,
p145
aVmeans a paragraph, a story.
p146
aVYou can almost have all the journalistic elements there.
p147
aVFor example, this is Hamlet, of Shakespeare.
p148
aVIt's the same content. One, you can see exactly
p149
aVone Chinese tweet is equal to 3.5 English tweets.
p150
aVChinese is always cheating, right?
p151
aVSo because of this, the Chinese really regard this
p152
aVmicroblogging as a media, not only a headline to media.
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd also, the clone, Sina company is
p155
aVthe guy who cloned Twitter.
p156
aVIt even has its own name, with Weibo.
p157
aV"Weibo" is the Chinese translation for "microblog".
p158
aVIt has its own innovation.
p159
aVAt the commenting area, [it makes] the Chinese Weibo
p160
aVmore like Facebook, rather than the original Twitter.
p161
aVSo these innovations and clones, as the Weibo and microblogging,
p162
aVwhen it came to China in 2009,
p163
aVit immediately became a media platform itself.
p164
aVIt became the media platform of 300 million readers.
p165
aVIt became the media.
p166
aVAnything not mentioned in Weibo,
p167
aVit does not appear to exist for the Chinese public.
p168
aa(lp169
VBut also, Chinese social media is
p170
aVreally changing Chinese mindsets and Chinese life.
p171
aVFor example, they give the voiceless people
p172
aVa channel to make your voice heard.
p173
aVWe had a petition system. It's a remedy outside the judicial system,
p174
aVbecause the Chinese central government wants to keep a myth:
p175
aVThe emperor is good. The old local officials are thugs.
p176
aVSo that's why the petitioner, the victims, the peasants,
p177
aVwant to take the train to Beijing to petition to the central government,
p178
aVthey want the emperor to settle the problem.
p179
aVBut when more and more people go to Beijing,
p180
aVthey also cause the risk of a revolution.
p181
aVSo they send them back in recent years.
p182
aVAnd even some of them were put into black jails.
p183
aVBut now we have Weibo, so I call it the Weibo petition.
p184
aVPeople just use their cell phones to tweet.
p185
aa(lp186
VSo your sad stories, by some chance your story
p187
aVwill be picked up by reporters, professors or celebrities.
p188
aVOne of them is Yao Chen,
p189
aVshe is the most popular microblogger in China,
p190
aVwho has about 21 million followers.
p191
aVThey're almost like a national TV station.
p192
aVIf you \u2014 so a sad story will be picked up by her.
p193
aVSo this Weibo social media, even in the censorship,
p194
aVstill gave the Chinese a real chance for 300 million people
p195
aVevery day chatting together, talking together.
p196
aVIt's like a big TED, right?
p197
aVBut also, it is like the first time a public sphere
p198
aVhappened in China.
p199
aVChinese people start to learn how to negotiate
p200
aVand talk to people.
p201
aa(lp202
VBut also, the cat, the censorship, is not sleeping.
p203
aVIt's so hard to post some sensitive words on the Chinese Weibo.
p204
aVFor example, you can't post the name of the president,
p205
aVHu Jintao, and also you can't post the city of Chongqing, the name,
p206
aVand until recently, you can't search the surname of top leaders.
p207
aVSo, the Chinese are very good at these puns
p208
aVand alternative wording and even memes.
p209
aVThey even name themselves \u2014 you know,
p210
aVuse the name of this world-changing
p211
aVbattle between the grass-mud horse and the river crab.
p212
aVThe grass-mud horse is caoníma,
p213
aVis the phonogram for motherfucker,
p214
aVthe Netizens call themselves.
p215
aVRiver crab is héxiè, is the phonogram for
p216
aVharmonization, for censorship.
p217
aVSo that's kind of a caoníma versus the héxiè, that's very good.
p218
aVSo, when some very political, exciting moments happened,
p219
aVyou can see on Weibo, you see a lot of very weird stories happened.
p220
aVWeird phrases and words, even if you have a PhD
p221
aVof Chinese language, you can't understand them.
p222
aa(lp223
VBut you can't even expand more, no, because
p224
aVChinese Sina Weibo, when it was founded
p225
aVwas exactly one month after the official blocking of Twitter.com.
p226
aVThat means from the very beginning,
p227
aVWeibo has already convinced the Chinese government,
p228
aVwe will not become the stage for
p229
aVany kind of a threat to the regime.
p230
aVFor example, anything you want to post,
p231
aVlike "get together" or "meet up" or "walk,"
p232
aVit is automatically recorded and data mined
p233
aVand reported to a poll for further political analyzing.
p234
aVEven if you want to have some gathering,
p235
aVbefore you go there, the police are already waiting for you.
p236
aVWhy? Because they have the data.
p237
aVThey have everything in their hands.
p238
aVSo they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the dissident.
p239
aVSo the crackdown is very serious.
p240
aa(lp241
VBut I want you to notice a very funny thing
p242
aVduring the process of the cat-and-mouse.
p243
aVThe cat is the censorship, but Chinese is not only one cat,
p244
aVbut also has local cats. Central cat and local cats.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VYou know, the server is in the [central] cats' hands,
p249
aVso even that \u2014 when the Netizens criticize the local government,
p250
aVthe local government has not any access to the data in Beijing.
p251
aVWithout bribing the central cats,
p252
aVhe can do nothing, only apologize.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo these three years, in the past three years,
p255
aVsocial movements about microblogging
p256
aVreally changed local government,
p257
aVbecame more and more transparent,
p258
aVbecause they can't access the data.
p259
aVThe server is in Beijing.
p260
aVThe story about the train crash,
p261
aVmaybe the question is not about why 10 million
p262
aVcriticisms in five days, but why the Chinese central government
p263
aVallowed the five days of freedom of speech online.
p264
aVIt's never happened before.
p265
aVAnd so it's very simple, because even the top leaders
p266
aVwere fed up with this guy, this independent kingdom.
p267
aVSo they want an excuse \u2014
p268
aVpublic opinion is a very good excuse to punish him.
p269
aa(lp270
VBut also, the Bo Xilai case recently, very big news,
p271
aVhe's a princeling.
p272
aVBut from February to April this year,
p273
aVWeibo really became a marketplace of rumors.
p274
aVYou can almost joke everything about these princelings,
p275
aVeverything! It's almost like you're living in the United States.
p276
aVBut if you dare to retweet or mention any fake coup
p277
aVabout Beijing, you definitely will be arrested.
p278
aVSo this kind of freedom is a targeted and precise window.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo Chinese in China, censorship is normal.
p281
aVSomething you find is, freedom is weird.
p282
aVSomething will happen behind it.
p283
aVBecause he was a very popular Leftist leader,
p284
aVso the central government wanted to purge him,
p285
aVand he was very cute, he convinced all the Chinese people,
p286
aVwhy he is so bad.
p287
aVSo Weibo, the 300 million public sphere,
p288
aVbecame a very good, convenient tool for a political fight.
p289
aa(lp290
VBut this technology is very new,
p291
aVbut technically is very old.
p292
aVIt was made famous by Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong,
p293
aVbecause he mobilized millions of Chinese people
p294
aVin the Cultural Revolution to destroy every local government.
p295
aVIt's very simple, because Chinese central government
p296
aVdoesn't need to even lead the public opinion.
p297
aVThey just give them a target window to not censor people.
p298
aVNot censoring in China has become a political tool.
p299
aa(lp300
VSo that's the update about this game, cat-and-mouse.
p301
aVSocial media changed Chinese mindset.
p302
aVMore and more Chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech
p303
aVand human rights as their birthright,
p304
aVnot some imported American privilege.
p305
aVBut also, it gave the Chinese a national public sphere
p306
aVfor people to, it's like a training of their citizenship,
p307
aVpreparing for future democracy.
p308
aVBut it didn't change the Chinese political system,
p309
aVand also the Chinese central government utilized this
p310
aVcentralized server structure to strengthen its power
p311
aVto counter the local government and the different factions.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo, what's the future?
p314
aVAfter all, we are the mouse.
p315
aVWhatever the future is, we should fight against the [cat].
p316
aVThere is not only in China, but also in the United States
p317
aVthere are some very small, cute but bad cats.
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
VSOPA, PIPA, ACTA, TPP and ITU.
p322
aVAnd also, like Facebook and Google, they claim they are friends of the mouse,
p323
aVbut sometimes we see them dating the cats.
p324
aVSo my conclusion is very simple.
p325
aVWe Chinese fight for our freedom,
p326
aVyou just watch your bad cats.
p327
aVDon't let them hook [up] with the Chinese cats.
p328
aVOnly in this way, in the future,
p329
aVwe will achieve the dreams of the mouse:
p330
aVthat we can tweet anytime, anywhere, without fear.
p331
aa(lp332
V(Applause)
p333
aa(lp334
VThank you.
