VOliver was an extremely dashing,
p4
aVhandsome, charming and largely unstable male
p5
aVthat I completely lost my heart to.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VHe was a Bernese mountain dog,
p10
aVand my ex-husband and I adopted him,
p11
aVand about six months in,
p12
aVwe realized that he was a mess.
p13
aVHe had such paralyzing separation anxiety
p14
aVthat we couldn't leave him alone.
p15
aVOnce, he jumped out of our third floor apartment.
p16
aVHe ate fabric. He ate things, recyclables.
p17
aVHe hunted flies that didn't exist.
p18
aVHe suffered from hallucinations.
p19
aVHe was diagnosed with a canine compulsive disorder
p20
aVand that's really just the tip of the iceberg.
p21
aa(lp22
VBut like with humans,
p23
aVsometimes it's six months in
p24
aVbefore you realize that
p25
aVthe person that you love has some issues.
p26
aV(Laughter)
p27
aVAnd most of us do not take the person we're dating
p28
aVback to the bar where we met them
p29
aVor give them back to the friend that introduced us,
p30
aVor sign them back up on Match.com.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aVWe love them anyway,
p33
aVand we stick to it,
p34
aVand that is what I did with my dog.
p35
aVAnd I was a \u2014 I'd studied biology.
p36
aVI have a Ph.D. in history of science
p37
aVfrom MIT,
p38
aVand had you asked me 10 years ago
p39
aVif a dog I loved, or just dogs generally,
p40
aVhad emotions, I would have said yes,
p41
aVbut I'm not sure that I would have told you
p42
aVthat they can also wind up with an anxiety disorder,
p43
aVa Prozac prescription and a therapist.
p44
aVBut then, I fell in love, and I realized that they can,
p45
aVand actually trying to help my own dog
p46
aVovercome his panic and his anxiety,
p47
aVit just changed my life.
p48
aVIt cracked open my world.
p49
aVAnd I spent the last seven years, actually,
p50
aVlooking into this topic of mental illness in other animals.
p51
aVCan they be mentally ill like people,
p52
aVand if so, what does it mean about us?
p53
aVAnd what I discovered is that I do believe
p54
aVthey can suffer from mental illness,
p55
aVand actually looking and trying to identify mental illness in them
p56
aVoften helps us be better friends to them
p57
aVand also can help us better understand ourselves.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo let's talk about diagnosis for a minute.
p60
aVMany of us think that we can't know
p61
aVwhat another animal is thinking,
p62
aVand that is true,
p63
aVbut any of you in relationships \u2014
p64
aVat least this is my case \u2014
p65
aVjust because you ask someone that you're with
p66
aVor your parent or your child how they feel
p67
aVdoesn't mean that they can tell you.
p68
aVThey may not have words to explain
p69
aVwhat it is that they're feeling,
p70
aVand they may not know.
p71
aVIt's actually a pretty recent phenomenon
p72
aVthat we feel that we have to talk to someone
p73
aVto understand their emotional distress.
p74
aVBefore the early 20th century,
p75
aVphysicians often diagnosed emotional distress
p76
aVin their patients just by observation.
p77
aVIt also turns out that thinking about
p78
aVmental illness in other animals
p79
aVisn't actually that much of a stretch.
p80
aVMost mental disorders in the United States
p81
aVare fear and anxiety disorders,
p82
aVand when you think about it, fear and anxiety
p83
aVare actually really extremely helpful animal emotions.
p84
aVUsually we feel fear and anxiety in situations that are dangerous,
p85
aVand once we feel them,
p86
aVwe then are motivated to move away
p87
aVfrom whatever is dangerous.
p88
aVThe problem is when we begin to feel fear and anxiety in situations that don't call for it.
p89
aVMood disorders, too, may actually just be
p90
aVthe unfortunate downside of being a feeling animal,
p91
aVand obsessive compulsive disorders also
p92
aVare often manifestations of a really healthy animal thing
p93
aVwhich is keeping yourself clean and groomed.
p94
aVThis tips into the territory of mental illness
p95
aVwhen you do things like
p96
aVcompulsively over-wash your hands or paws,
p97
aVor you develop a ritual that's so extreme
p98
aVthat you can't sit down to a bowl of food
p99
aVunless you engage in that ritual.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo for humans, we have the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual,"
p102
aVwhich is basically an atlas
p103
aVof the currently agreed-upon mental disorders.
p104
aVIn other animals, we have YouTube.
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aVThis is just one search I did for "OCD dog"
p107
aVbut I encourage all of you
p108
aVto look at "OCD cat."
p109
aVYou will be shocked by what you see.
p110
aVI'm going to show you just a couple examples.
p111
aVThis is an example of shadow-chasing.
p112
aVI know, and it's funny and in some ways it's cute.
p113
aVThe issue, though, is that dogs can develop compulsions like this
p114
aVthat they then engage in all day.
p115
aVSo they won't go for a walk,
p116
aVthey won't hang out with their friends,
p117
aVthey won't eat.
p118
aVThey'll develop fixations
p119
aVlike chasing their tails compulsively.
p120
aa(lp121
VHere's an example of a cat named Gizmo.
p122
aVHe looks like he's on a stakeout
p123
aVbut he does this for many, many, many hours a day.
p124
aVHe just sits there and he will paw and paw and paw
p125
aVat the screen.
p126
aVThis is another example of what's considered
p127
aVa stereotypic behavior.
p128
aVThis is a sun bear at the Oakland Zoo named Ting Ting.
p129
aVAnd if you just sort of happened upon this scene,
p130
aVyou might think that Ting Ting
p131
aVis just playing with a stick,
p132
aVbut Ting Ting does this all day,
p133
aVand if you pay close attention
p134
aVand if I showed you guys the full half-hour of this clip,
p135
aVyou'd see that he does the exact same thing
p136
aVin the exact same order, and he spins the stick
p137
aVin the exact same way every time.
p138
aVOther super common behaviors that you may see,
p139
aVparticularly in captive animals,
p140
aVare pacing stereotypies or swaying stereotypies,
p141
aVand actually, humans do this too,
p142
aVand in us, we'll sway,
p143
aVwe'll move from side to side.
p144
aVMany of us do this, and sometimes
p145
aVit's an effort to soothe ourselves,
p146
aVand I think in other animals that is often the case too.
p147
aa(lp148
VBut it's not just stereotypic behaviors
p149
aVthat other animals engage in.
p150
aVThis is Gigi. She's a gorilla that lives
p151
aVat the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston.
p152
aVShe actually has a Harvard psychiatrist,
p153
aVand she's been treated for a mood disorder
p154
aVamong other things.
p155
aVMany animals develop mood disorders.
p156
aVLots of creatures \u2014
p157
aVthis horse is just one example \u2014
p158
aVdevelop self-destructive behaviors.
p159
aVThey'll gnaw on things
p160
aVor do other things that may also soothe them,
p161
aVeven if they're self-destructive,
p162
aVwhich could be considered similar
p163
aVto the ways that some humans cut themselves.
p164
aa(lp165
VPlucking.
p166
aVTurns out, if you have fur or feathers or skin,
p167
aVyou can pluck yourself compulsively,
p168
aVand some parrots actually have been studied
p169
aVto better understand trichotillomania, or compulsive plucking in humans,
p170
aVsomething that affects
p171
aV20 million Americans right now.
p172
aVLab rats pluck themselves too.
p173
aVIn them, it's called barbering.
p174
aVCanine veterans of conflicts of Iraq and Afghanistan
p175
aVare coming back with what's considered canine PTSD,
p176
aVand they're having a hard time reentering civilian life
p177
aVwhen they come back from deployments.
p178
aVThey can be too scared to approach men with beards
p179
aVor to hop into cars.
p180
aa(lp181
VI want to be careful and be clear, though.
p182
aVI do not think that canine PTSD
p183
aVis the same as human PTSD.
p184
aVBut I also do not think that my PTSD
p185
aVis like your PTSD,
p186
aVor that my anxiety or that my sadness is like yours.
p187
aVWe are all different.
p188
aVWe also all have very different susceptibilities.
p189
aVSo two dogs, raised in the same household,
p190
aVexposed to the very same things,
p191
aVone may develop, say, a debilitating fear of motorcycles,
p192
aVor a phobia of the beep of the microwave,
p193
aVand another one is going to be just fine.
p194
aa(lp195
VSo one thing that people ask me pretty frequently:
p196
aVIs this just an instance of humans
p197
aVdriving other animals crazy?
p198
aVOr, is animal mental illness just a result of mistreatment or abuse?
p199
aVAnd it turns out we're actually
p200
aVso much more complicated than that.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo one great thing that has happened to me
p203
aVis recently I published a book on this,
p204
aVand every day now that I open my email
p205
aVor when I go to a reading
p206
aVor even when I go to a cocktail party,
p207
aVpeople tell me their stories
p208
aVof the animals that they have met.
p209
aVAnd recently, I did a reading in California,
p210
aVand a woman raised her hand after the talk and she said,
p211
aV"Dr. Braitman, I think my cat has PTSD."
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd I said, "Well, why? Tell me a little bit about it."
p214
aa(lp215
VSo, Ping is her cat. She was a rescue,
p216
aVand she used to live with an elderly man,
p217
aVand one day the man was vacuuming
p218
aVand he suffered a heart attack, and he died.
p219
aVA week later, Ping was discovered in the apartment
p220
aValongside the body of her owner,
p221
aVand the vacuum had been running the entire time.
p222
aVFor many months, up to I think two years after that incident,
p223
aVshe was so scared she couldn't be in the house when anyone was cleaning.
p224
aVShe was quite literally a scaredy cat.
p225
aVShe would hide in the closet.
p226
aVShe was un-self-confident and shaky,
p227
aVbut with the loving support of her family,
p228
aVa lot of a time, and their patience,
p229
aVnow, three years later,
p230
aVshe's actually a happy, confident cat.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnother story of trauma and recovery that I came across
p233
aVwas actually a few years ago.
p234
aVI was in Thailand to do some research.
p235
aVI met a monkey named Boonlua,
p236
aVand when Boonlua was a baby,
p237
aVhe was attacked by a pack of dogs,
p238
aVand they ripped off both of his legs and one arm,
p239
aVand Boonlua dragged himself to a monastery,
p240
aVwhere the monks took him in.
p241
aVThey called in a veterinarian, who treated his wounds.
p242
aVEventually, Boonlua wound up
p243
aVat an elephant facility,
p244
aVand the keepers really decided to take him under their wing,
p245
aVand they figured out what he liked,
p246
aVwhich, it turned out, was mint Mentos
p247
aVand Rhinoceros beetles and eggs.
p248
aVBut they worried, because he was social, that he was lonely,
p249
aVand they didn't want to put him in with another monkey,
p250
aVbecause they thought with just one arm,
p251
aVhe wouldn't be able to defend himself or even play.
p252
aVAnd so they gave him a rabbit,
p253
aVand Boonlua was immediately a different monkey.
p254
aVHe was extremely happy to be with this rabbit.
p255
aVThey groomed each other, they become close friends,
p256
aVand then the rabbit had bunnies,
p257
aVand Boonlua was even happier than he was before,
p258
aVand it had in a way given him
p259
aVa reason to wake up in the morning,
p260
aVand in fact it gave him such a reason to wake up
p261
aVthat he decided not to sleep.
p262
aVHe became extremely protective of these bunnies,
p263
aVand he stopped sleeping,
p264
aVand he would sort of nod off
p265
aVwhile trying to take care of them.
p266
aVIn fact, he was so protective and so affectionate
p267
aVwith these babies that the sanctuary
p268
aVeventually had to take them away from him
p269
aVbecause he was so protective, he was worried
p270
aVthat their mother might hurt them.
p271
aVSo after they were taken away, the sanctuary staff
p272
aVworried that he would fall into a depression,
p273
aVand so to avoid that,
p274
aVthey gave him another rabbit friend.
p275
aV(Laughter)
p276
aVMy official opinion is that he does not look depressed.
p277
aV(Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VSo one thing that I would really like people to feel
p280
aVis that you really should feel empowered
p281
aVto make some assumptions
p282
aVabout the creatures that you know well.
p283
aVSo when it comes to your dog
p284
aVor your cat or maybe your one-armed monkey
p285
aVthat you happen to know,
p286
aVif you think that they are traumatized or depressed,
p287
aVyou're probably right.
p288
aVThis is extremely anthropomorphic,
p289
aVor the assignation of human characteristics
p290
aVonto non-human animals or things.
p291
aVI don't think, though, that that's a problem.
p292
aVI don't think that we can not anthropomorphize.
p293
aVIt's not as if you can take your human brain out of your head
p294
aVand put it in a jar and then use it
p295
aVto think about another animal thinking.
p296
aVWe will always be one animal wondering
p297
aVabout the emotional experience of another animal.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo then the choice becomes, how do you anthropomorphize well?
p300
aVOr do you anthropomorphize poorly?
p301
aVAnd anthropomorphizing poorly
p302
aVis all too common.
p303
aV(Laughter)
p304
aVIt may include dressing your corgis up and throwing them a wedding,
p305
aVor getting too close to exotic wildlife because
p306
aVyou believe that you had a spiritual connection.
p307
aVThere's all manner of things.
p308
aVAnthropomorphizing well, however, I believe is based
p309
aVon accepting our animal similarities with other species
p310
aVand using them to make assumptions
p311
aVthat are informed about other  animals' minds and experiences,
p312
aVand there's actually an entire industry
p313
aVthat is in some ways based on anthropomorphizing well,
p314
aVand that is the psychopharmaceutical industry.
p315
aa(lp316
VOne in five Americans is currently taking a psychopharmaceutical drug,
p317
aVfrom the antidepressants and antianxiety medications
p318
aVto the antipsychotics.
p319
aVIt turns out that we owe this
p320
aVentire psychopharmaceutical arsenal
p321
aVto other animals.
p322
aVThese drugs were tested in non-human animals first,
p323
aVand not just for toxicity but for behavioral effects.
p324
aVThe very popular antipsychotic Thorazine
p325
aVfirst relaxed rats before it relaxed people.
p326
aVThe antianxiety medication Librium
p327
aVwas given to cats selected for their meanness in the 1950s
p328
aVand made them into peaceable felines.
p329
aVAnd even antidepressants were first tested in rabbits.
p330
aa(lp331
VToday, however, we are not just giving these drugs
p332
aVto other animals as test subjects,
p333
aVbut they're giving them these drugs as patients,
p334
aVboth in ethical and much less ethical ways.
p335
aVSeaWorld gives mother orcas antianxiety medications
p336
aVwhen their calves are taken away.
p337
aVMany zoo gorillas have been given antipsychotics
p338
aVand antianxiety medications.
p339
aVBut dogs like my own Oliver
p340
aVare given antidepressants and some antianxiety medications
p341
aVto keep them from jumping out of buildings
p342
aVor jumping into traffic.
p343
aVJust recently, actually, a study came out in "Science"
p344
aVthat showed that even crawdads
p345
aVresponded to antianxiety medication.
p346
aVIt made them braver, less skittish,
p347
aVand more likely to explore their environment.
p348
aa(lp349
VIt's hard to know how many animals are on these drugs,
p350
aVbut I can tell you that the animal pharmaceutical industry
p351
aVis immense and growing,
p352
aVfrom seven billion dollars in 2011
p353
aVto a projected 9.25 billion by the year 2015.
p354
aa(lp355
VSome animals are on these drugs indefinitely.
p356
aVOthers, like one bonobo who lives in Milwaukee
p357
aVat the zoo there was on them
p358
aVuntil he started to save his Paxil prescription
p359
aVand then distribute it among the other bonobos.
p360
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p361
aa(lp362
VMore than psychopharmaceuticals, though,
p363
aVthere are many, many, many other
p364
aVtherapeutic interventions that help other creatures.
p365
aVAnd here is a place where I think actually
p366
aVthat veterinary medicine can teach something
p367
aVto human medicine,
p368
aVwhich is, if you take your dog, who is, say,
p369
aVcompulsively chasing his tail,
p370
aVinto the veterinary behaviorist,
p371
aVtheir first action isn't to reach for the prescription pad;
p372
aVit's to ask you about your dog's life.
p373
aVThey want to know how often your dog gets outside.
p374
aVThey want to know how much exercise your dog is getting.
p375
aVThey want to know how much social time
p376
aVwith other dogs and other humans.
p377
aVThey want to talk to you about what sorts of therapies,
p378
aVlargely behavior therapies,
p379
aVyou've tried with that animal.
p380
aVThose are the things that often tend to help the most,
p381
aVespecially when combined with psychopharmaceuticals.
p382
aa(lp383
VThe thing, though, I believe, that helps the most,
p384
aVparticularly with social animals,
p385
aVis time with other social animals.
p386
aVIn many ways, I feel like I became a service animal
p387
aVto my own dog,
p388
aVand I have seen parrots do it for people
p389
aVand people do it for parrots
p390
aVand dogs do it for elephants
p391
aVand elephants do it for other elephants.
p392
aVI don't know about you;
p393
aVI get a lot of Internet forwards
p394
aVof unlikely animal friendships.
p395
aVI also think it's a huge part of Facebook,
p396
aVthe monkey that adopts the cat
p397
aVor the great dane who adopted the orphaned fawn,
p398
aVor the cow that makes friends with the pig,
p399
aVand had you asked me eight, nine years ago, about these,
p400
aVI would have told you that they were hopelessly sentimental
p401
aVand maybe too anthropomorphic in the wrong way
p402
aVand maybe even staged, and what I can tell you now
p403
aVis that there is actually something to this.
p404
aVThis is legit. In fact, some interesting studies
p405
aVhave pointed to oxytocin levels,
p406
aVwhich are a kind of bonding hormone
p407
aVthat we release when we're having sex or nursing
p408
aVor around someone that we care for extremely,
p409
aVoxytocin levels raising in both humans and dogs
p410
aVwho care about each other
p411
aVor who enjoy each other's company,
p412
aVand beyond that, other studies show that oxytocin
p413
aVraised even in other pairs of animals,
p414
aVso, say, in goats and dogs who were friends and played with each other,
p415
aVtheir levels spiked afterwards.
p416
aa(lp417
VI have a friend who really showed me that
p418
aVmental health is in fact a two-way street.
p419
aVHis name is Lonnie Hodge, and he's a veteran of Vietnam.
p420
aVWhen he returned, he started working
p421
aVwith survivors of genocide and a lot of people
p422
aVwho had gone through war trauma.
p423
aVAnd he had PTSD and also a fear of heights,
p424
aVbecause in Vietnam, he had been
p425
aVrappelling backwards out of helicopters
p426
aVover the skids,
p427
aVand he was givena service dog named Gander, a labradoodle,
p428
aVto help him with PTSD and his fear of heights.
p429
aVThis is them actually on the first day that they met,
p430
aVwhich is amazing, and since then,
p431
aVthey've spent a lot of time together
p432
aVvisiting with other veterans suffering from similar issues.
p433
aVBut what's so interesting to me about Lonnie and Gander's relationship
p434
aVis about a few months in,
p435
aVGander actually developed a fear of heights,
p436
aVprobably because he was watching Lonnie so closely.
p437
aVWhat's pretty great about this, though, is that he's still a fantastic service dog,
p438
aVbecause now, when they're both at a great height,
p439
aVLonnie is so concerned with Gander's well-being
p440
aVthat he forgets to be scared of the heights himself.
p441
aa(lp442
VSince I've spent so much time with these stories,
p443
aVdigging into archives,
p444
aVI literally spent years doing this research,
p445
aVand it's changed me.
p446
aVI no longer look at animals at the species level.
p447
aVI look at them as individuals,
p448
aVand I think about them as creatures
p449
aVwith their own individual weather systems
p450
aVguiding their behavior and informing
p451
aVhow they respond to the world.
p452
aVAnd I really believe that this has made me
p453
aVa more curious and a more empathetic person,
p454
aVboth to the animals that share my bed
p455
aVand occasionally wind up on my plate,
p456
aVbut also to the people that I know
p457
aVwho are suffering from anxiety
p458
aVand from phobias and all manner of other things,
p459
aVand I really do believe that
p460
aVeven though you can't know exactly
p461
aVwhat's going on in the mind of a pig
p462
