VFor me they normally happen, these career crises,
p4
aVoften, actually, on a Sunday evening,
p5
aVjust as the sun is starting to set,
p6
aVand the gap between my hopes for myself and the reality of my life
p7
aVstarts to diverge so painfully
p8
aVthat I normally end up weeping into a pillow.
p9
aa(lp10
VI'm mentioning all this \u2014
p11
aVI'm mentioning all this because I think this is not merely a personal problem;
p12
aVyou may think I'm wrong in this,
p13
aVbut I think we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated
p14
aVby career crises, by moments when what we thought we knew \u2014
p15
aVabout our lives, about our careers \u2014
p16
aVcomes into contact with a threatening sort of reality.
p17
aa(lp18
VIt's perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living.
p19
aVIt's perhaps harder than ever before
p20
aVto stay calm, to be free of career anxiety.
p21
aVI want to look now, if I may, at some of the reasons
p22
aVwhy we might be feeling anxiety about our careers.
p23
aVWhy we might be victims of these career crises,
p24
aVas we're weeping softly into our pillows.
p25
aVOne of the reasons why we might be suffering
p26
aVis that we are surrounded by snobs.
p27
aa(lp28
VIn a way, I've got some bad news,
p29
aVparticularly to anybody who's come to Oxford from abroad.
p30
aVThere's a real problem with snobbery,
p31
aVbecause sometimes people from outside the U.K.
p32
aVimagine that snobbery is a distinctively U.K. phenomenon,
p33
aVfixated on country houses and titles.
p34
aVThe bad news is that's not true.
p35
aVSnobbery is a global phenomenon; we are a global organization,
p36
aVthis is a global phenomenon.
p37
aVWhat is a snob?
p38
aVA snob is anybody who takes a small part of you,
p39
aVand uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are.
p40
aVThat is snobbery.
p41
aa(lp42
VThe dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery.
p43
aVYou encounter it within minutes at a party, when you get asked
p44
aVthat famous iconic question of the early 21st century,
p45
aV"What do you do?"
p46
aVAccording to how you answer that question,
p47
aVpeople are either incredibly delighted to see you,
p48
aVor look at their watch and make their excuses.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, the opposite of a snob is your mother.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VNot necessarily your mother, or indeed mine,
p57
aVbut, as it were, the ideal mother,
p58
aVsomebody who doesn't care about your achievements.
p59
aVUnfortunately, most people are not our mothers.
p60
aVMost people make a strict correlation between how much time,
p61
aVand if you like, love \u2014
p62
aVnot romantic love, though that may be something \u2014
p63
aVbut love in general, respect \u2014 they are willing to accord us,
p64
aVthat will be strictly defined by our position in the social hierarchy.
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd that's a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers
p67
aVand indeed start caring so much about material goods.
p68
aVYou know, we're often told that we live in very materialistic times,
p69
aVthat we're all greedy people.
p70
aVI don't think we are particularly materialistic.
p71
aVI think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards
p72
aVto the acquisition of material goods.
p73
aVIt's not the material goods we want; it's the rewards we want.
p74
aVIt's a new way of looking at luxury goods.
p75
aVThe next time you see somebody driving a Ferrari, don't think,
p76
aV"This is somebody who's greedy."
p77
aVThink, "This is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love."
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VFeel sympathy, rather than contempt.
p82
aa(lp83
VThere are other reasons \u2014
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VThere are other reasons why it's perhaps harder now to feel calm than ever before.
p88
aVOne of these, and it's paradoxical,
p89
aVbecause it's linked to something that's rather nice,
p90
aVis the hope we all have for our careers.
p91
aVNever before have expectations been so high
p92
aVabout what human beings can achieve with their lifespan.
p93
aVWe're told, from many sources, that anyone can achieve anything.
p94
aVWe've done away with the caste system,
p95
aVwe are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please.
p96
aVAnd it's a beautiful idea.
p97
aVAlong with that is a kind of spirit of equality;
p98
aVwe're all basically equal.
p99
aVThere are no strictly defined hierarchies.
p100
aVThere is one really big problem with this,
p101
aVand that problem is envy.
p102
aVEnvy, it's a real taboo to mention envy,
p103
aVbut if there's one dominant emotion in modern society, that is envy.
p104
aVAnd it's linked to the spirit of equality.
p105
aa(lp106
VLet me explain.
p107
aVI think it would be very unusual for anyone here, or anyone watching,
p108
aVto be envious of the Queen of England.
p109
aVEven though she is much richer than any of you are,
p110
aVand she's got a very large house,
p111
aVthe reason why we don't envy her is because she's too weird.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VShe's simply too strange.
p116
aVWe can't relate to her, she speaks in a funny way,
p117
aVshe comes from an odd place.
p118
aVSo we can't relate to her,
p119
aVand when you can't relate to somebody, you don't envy them.
p120
aa(lp121
VThe closer two people are \u2014 in age, in background,
p122
aVin the process of identification \u2014 the more there's a danger of envy,
p123
aVwhich is incidentally why none of you should ever go to a school reunion,
p124
aVbecause there is no stronger reference point than people one was at school with.
p125
aVThe problem of modern society is it turns the whole world into a school.
p126
aVEverybody's wearing jeans, everybody's the same.
p127
aVAnd yet, they're not.
p128
aVSo there's a spirit of equality combined with deep inequality,
p129
aVwhich can make for a very stressful situation.
p130
aa(lp131
VIt's probably as unlikely that you would nowadays
p132
aVbecome as rich and famous as Bill Gates,
p133
aVas it was unlikely in the 17th century
p134
aVthat you would accede to the ranks of the French aristocracy.
p135
aVBut the point is, it doesn't feel that way.
p136
aVIt's made to feel, by magazines and other media outlets,
p137
aVthat if you've got energy, a few bright ideas about technology, a garage \u2014
p138
aVyou, too, could start a major thing.
p139
aa(lp140
V(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VThe consequences of this problem make themselves felt in bookshops.
p143
aVWhen you go to a large bookshop and look at the self-help sections,
p144
aVas I sometimes do \u2014
p145
aVif you analyze self-help books produced in the world today,
p146
aVthere are basically two kinds.
p147
aVThe first kind tells you, "You can do it! You can make it! Anything's possible!"
p148
aVThe other kind tells you how to cope with what we politely call "low self-esteem,"
p149
aVor impolitely call, "feeling very bad about yourself."
p150
aa(lp151
VThere's a real correlation
p152
aVbetween a society that tells people that they can do anything,
p153
aVand the existence of low self-esteem.
p154
aVSo that's another way in which something quite positive can have a nasty kickback.
p155
aVThere is another reason why we might be feeling more anxious \u2014
p156
aVabout our careers, about our status in the world today, than ever before.
p157
aVAnd it's, again, linked to something nice.
p158
aVAnd that nice thing is called meritocracy.
p159
aa(lp160
VEverybody, all politicians on Left and Right,
p161
aVagree that meritocracy is a great thing,
p162
aVand we should all be trying to make our societies really, really meritocratic.
p163
aVIn other words \u2014 what is a meritocratic society?
p164
aVA meritocratic society is one in which, if you've got talent and energy and skill,
p165
aVyou will get to the top, nothing should hold you back.
p166
aVIt's a beautiful idea.
p167
aVThe problem is, if you really believe in a society
p168
aVwhere those who merit to get to the top, get to the top,
p169
aVyou'll also, by implication, and in a far more nasty way,
p170
aVbelieve in a society where those who deserve to get to the bottom
p171
aValso get to the bottom and stay there.
p172
aVIn other words, your position in life comes to seem not accidental,
p173
aVbut merited and deserved.
p174
aVAnd that makes failure seem much more crushing.
p175
aa(lp176
VYou know, in the Middle Ages, in England,
p177
aVwhen you met a very poor person,
p178
aVthat person would be described as an "unfortunate" \u2014
p179
aVliterally, somebody who had not been blessed by fortune, an unfortunate.
p180
aVNowadays, particularly in the United States,
p181
aVif you meet someone at the bottom of society,
p182
aVthey may unkindly be described as a "loser."
p183
aVThere's a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser,
p184
aVand that shows 400 years of evolution in society
p185
aVand our belief in who is responsible for our lives.
p186
aVIt's no longer the gods, it's us. We're in the driving seat.
p187
aa(lp188
VThat's exhilarating if you're doing well,
p189
aVand very crushing if you're not.
p190
aVIt leads, in the worst cases \u2014
p191
aVin the analysis of a sociologist like Emil Durkheim \u2014
p192
aVit leads to increased rates of suicide.
p193
aVThere are more suicides in developed, individualistic countries
p194
aVthan in any other part of the world.
p195
aVAnd some of the reason for that
p196
aVis that people take what happens to them extremely personally \u2014
p197
aVthey own their success, but they also own their failure.
p198
aa(lp199
VIs there any relief from some of these pressures
p200
aVthat I've been outlining?
p201
aVI think there is.
p202
aVI just want to turn to a few of them.
p203
aVLet's take meritocracy.
p204
aVThis idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to,
p205
aVI think it's a crazy idea, completely crazy.
p206
aVI will support any politician of Left and Right,
p207
aVwith any halfway-decent meritocratic idea;
p208
aVI am a meritocrat in that sense.
p209
aVBut I think it's insane to believe
p210
aVthat we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic;
p211
aVit's an impossible dream.
p212
aa(lp213
VThe idea that we will make a society where literally everybody is graded,
p214
aVthe good at the top, bad at the bottom,
p215
aVexactly done as it should be, is impossible.
p216
aVThere are simply too many random factors:
p217
aVaccidents, accidents of birth,
p218
aVaccidents of things dropping on people's heads, illnesses, etc.
p219
aVWe will never get to grade them,
p220
aVnever get to grade people as they should.
p221
aa(lp222
VI'm drawn to a lovely quote by St. Augustine in "The City of God,"
p223
aVwhere he says, "It's a sin to judge any man by his post."
p224
aVIn modern English that would mean
p225
aVit's a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to,
p226
aVdependent on their business card.
p227
aVIt's not the post that should count.
p228
aVAccording to St. Augustine, only God can really put everybody in their place;
p229
aVhe's going to do that on the Day of Judgment,
p230
aVwith angels and trumpets, and the skies will open.
p231
aVInsane idea, if you're a secularist person, like me.
p232
aVBut something very valuable in that idea, nevertheless.
p233
aa(lp234
VIn other words, hold your horses when you're coming to judge people.
p235
aVYou don't necessarily know what someone's true value is.
p236
aVThat is an unknown part of them,
p237
aVand we shouldn't behave as though it is known.
p238
aVThere is another source of solace and comfort for all this.
p239
aVWhen we think about failing in life, when we think about failure,
p240
aVone of the reasons why we fear failing
p241
aVis not just a loss of income, a loss of status.
p242
aVWhat we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others.
p243
aVAnd it exists.
p244
aa(lp245
VThe number one organ of ridicule, nowadays, is the newspaper.
p246
aVIf you open the newspaper any day of the week,
p247
aVit's full of people who've messed up their lives.
p248
aVThey've slept with the wrong person, taken the wrong substance,
p249
aVpassed the wrong piece of legislation \u2014
p250
aVwhatever it is, and then are fit for ridicule.
p251
aVIn other words, they have failed. And they are described as "losers."
p252
aVNow, is there any alternative to this?
p253
aVI think the Western tradition shows us one glorious alternative, which is tragedy.
p254
aa(lp255
VTragic art, as it developed in the theaters of ancient Greece,
p256
aVin the fifth century B.C., was essentially an art form
p257
aVdevoted to tracing how people fail,
p258
aVand also according them a level of sympathy,
p259
aVwhich ordinary life would not necessarily accord them.
p260
aVA few years ago, I was thinking about this,
p261
aVand I went to "The Sunday Sport,"
p262
aVa tabloid newspaper I don't recommend you start reading
p263
aVif you're not familiar with it already.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd I went to talk to them
p268
aVabout certain of the great tragedies of Western art.
p269
aVI wanted to see how they would seize the bare bones of certain stories,
p270
aVif they came in as a news item at the news desk on a Saturday afternoon.
p271
aa(lp272
VI mentioned Othello; they'd not heard of it but were fascinated.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VI asked them to write a headline for the story.
p277
aVThey came up with "Love-Crazed Immigrant Kills Senator's Daughter."
p278
aVSplashed across the headline.
p279
aVI gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary.
p280
aVAgain, a book they were enchanted to discover.
p281
aVAnd they wrote "Shopaholic Adulteress Swallows Arsenic After Credit Fraud."
p282
aa(lp283
V(Laughter)
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd then my favorite \u2014
p286
aVthey really do have a kind of genius of their own, these guys \u2014
p287
aVmy favorite is Sophocles' Oedipus the King:
p288
aV"Sex With Mum Was Blinding."
p289
aa(lp290
V(Laughter)
p291
aa(lp292
V(Applause)
p293
aa(lp294
VIn a way, if you like, at one end of the spectrum of sympathy,
p295
aVyou've got the tabloid newspaper.
p296
aVAt the other end of the spectrum, you've got tragedy and tragic art.
p297
aVAnd I suppose I'm arguing that we should learn a little bit
p298
aVabout what's happening in tragic art.
p299
aVIt would be insane to call Hamlet a loser.
p300
aVHe is not a loser, though he has lost.
p301
aVAnd I think that is the message of tragedy to us,
p302
aVand why it's so very, very important, I think.
p303
aa(lp304
VThe other thing about modern society and why it causes this anxiety,
p305
aVis that we have nothing at its center that is non-human.
p306
aVWe are the first society to be living in a world
p307
aVwhere we don't worship anything other than ourselves.
p308
aVWe think very highly of ourselves, and so we should;
p309
aVwe've put people on the Moon, done all sorts of extraordinary things.
p310
aVAnd so we tend to worship ourselves. Our heroes are human heroes.
p311
aVThat's a very new situation.
p312
aVMost other societies have had, right at their center,
p313
aVthe worship of something transcendent: a god, a spirit, a natural force,
p314
aVthe universe, whatever it is \u2014 something else that is being worshiped.
p315
aVWe've slightly lost the habit of doing that,
p316
aVwhich is, I think, why we're particularly drawn to nature.
p317
aVNot for the sake of our health, though it's often presented that way,
p318
aVbut because it's an escape from the human anthill.
p319
aVIt's an escape from our own competition,
p320
aVand our own dramas.
p321
aVAnd that's why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans,
p322
aVand contemplating the Earth from outside its perimeters, etc.
p323
aVWe like to feel in contact with something that is non-human,
p324
aVand that is so deeply important to us.
p325
aa(lp326
VWhat I think I've been talking about really is success and failure.
p327
aVAnd one of the interesting things about success
p328
aVis that we think we know what it means.
p329
aVIf I said that there's somebody behind the screen who's very successful,
p330
aVcertain ideas would immediately come to mind.
p331
aVYou'd think that person might have made a lot of money,
p332
aVachieved renown in some field.
p333
aVMy own theory of success \u2014
p334
aVI'm somebody who's very interested in success,
p335
aVI really want to be successful,
p336
aValways thinking, how can I be more successful?
p337
aVBut as I get older, I'm also very nuanced about what that word "success" might mean.
p338
aa(lp339
VHere's an insight that I've had about success:
p340
aVYou can't be successful at everything.
p341
aVWe hear a lot of talk about work-life balance.
p342
aVNonsense.
p343
aVYou can't have it all. You can't.
p344
aVSo any vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on,
p345
aVwhere the element of loss is.
p346
aVAnd I think any wise life will accept,
p347
aVas I say, that there is going to be an element where we're not succeeding.
p348
aa(lp349
VAnd the thing about a successful life is that a lot of the time,
p350
aVour ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own.
p351
aVThey're sucked in from other people;
p352
aVchiefly, if you're a man, your father, and if you're a woman, your mother.
p353
aVPsychoanalysis has been drumming home this message for about 80 years.
p354
aVNo one's quite listening hard enough, but I very much believe it's true.
p355
aa(lp356
VAnd we also suck in messages from everything from the television,
p357
aVto advertising, to marketing, etc.
p358
aVThese are hugely powerful forces
p359
aVthat define what we want and how we view ourselves.
p360
aVWhen we're told that banking is a very respectable profession,
p361
aVa lot of us want to go into banking.
p362
aVWhen banking is no longer so respectable, we lose interest in banking.
p363
aVWe are highly open to suggestion.
p364
aa(lp365
VSo what I want to argue for is not that we should give up
p366
aVon our ideas of success,
p367
aVbut we should make sure that they are our own.
p368
aVWe should focus in on our ideas,
p369
aVand make sure that we own them;
p370
aVthat we are truly the authors of our own ambitions.
p371
aVBecause it's bad enough not getting what you want,
p372
aVbut it's even worse to have an idea of what it is you want,
p373
aVand find out, at the end of the journey,
p374
aVthat it isn't, in fact, what you wanted all along.
p375
aa(lp376
VSo, I'm going to end it there.
p377
aVBut what I really want to stress is: by all means, success, yes.
p378
aVBut let's accept the strangeness of some of our ideas.
p379
aVLet's probe away at our notions of success.
p380
aVLet's make sure our ideas of success are truly our own.
p381
aa(lp382
VThank you very much.
p383
aa(lp384
V(Applause)
p385
aa(lp386
VChris Anderson: That was fascinating.
p387
aVBut how do you reconcile this idea
p388
aVof it being bad to think of someone as a "loser,"
p389
aVwith the idea that a lot of people like, of seizing control of your life,
p390
aVand that a society that encourages that,
p391
aVperhaps has to have some winners and losers?
p392
aa(lp393
VAlain De Botton: Yes, I think it's merely the randomness
p394
aVof the winning and losing process that I want to stress,
p395
aVbecause the emphasis nowadays is so much on the justice of everything,
p396
aVand politicians always talk about justice.
p397
aVNow I'm a firm believer in justice, I just think that it's impossible.
p398
aVSo we should do everything we can to pursue it,
p399
aVbut we should always remember that whoever is facing us,
p400
aVwhatever has happened in their lives,
p401
aVthere will be a strong element of the haphazard.
p402
aVThat's what I'm trying to leave room for;
p403
aVotherwise, it can get quite claustrophobic.
p404
aa(lp405
VCA: I mean, do you believe that you can combine
p406
aVyour kind of kinder, gentler philosophy of work
p407
aVwith a successful economy?
p408
aVOr do you think that you can't,
p409
aVbut it doesn't matter that much that we're putting too much emphasis on that?
p410
aa(lp411
VAB: The nightmare thought
p412
aVis that frightening people is the best way to get work out of them,
p413
aVand that somehow the crueler the environment,
p414
aVthe more people will rise to the challenge.
p415
aVYou want to think, who would you like as your ideal dad?
p416
aVAnd your ideal dad is somebody who is tough but gentle.
p417
aVAnd it's a very hard line to make.
p418
aVWe need fathers, as it were, the exemplary father figures in society,
p419
aVavoiding the two extremes,
p420
aVwhich is the authoritarian disciplinarian on the one hand,
p421
aVand on the other, the lax, no-rules option.
p422
