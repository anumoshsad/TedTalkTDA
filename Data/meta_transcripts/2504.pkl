VBy raising your hand,
p4
aVhow many of you know at least one person on the screen?
p5
aVWow, it's almost a full house.
p6
aVIt's true, they are very famous in their fields.
p7
aVAnd do you know what all of them have in common?
p8
aVThey all died of pancreatic cancer.
p9
aVHowever, although it's very, very sad this news,
p10
aVit's also thanks to their personal stories
p11
aVthat we have raised awareness of how lethal this disease can be.
p12
aa(lp13
VIt's become the third cause of cancer deaths,
p14
aVand only eight percent of the patients will survive beyond five years.
p15
aVThat's a very tiny number,
p16
aVespecially if you compare it with breast cancer,
p17
aVwhere the survival rate is almost 90 percent.
p18
aVSo it doesn't really come as a surprise
p19
aVthat being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer
p20
aVmeans facing an almost certain death sentence.
p21
aVWhat's shocking, though, is that in the last 40 years,
p22
aVthis number hasn't changed a bit,
p23
aVwhile much more progress has been made
p24
aVwith other types of tumors.
p25
aVSo how can we make pancreatic cancer treatment more effective?
p26
aVAs a biomedical entrepreneur,
p27
aVI like to work on problems that seem impossible,
p28
aVunderstanding their limitations
p29
aVand trying to find new, innovative solutions
p30
aVthat can change their outcome.
p31
aa(lp32
VThe first piece of bad news with pancreatic cancer
p33
aVis that your pancreas is in the middle of your belly, literally.
p34
aVIt's depicted in orange on the screen.
p35
aVBut you can barely see it
p36
aVuntil I remove all the other organs in front.
p37
aVIt's also surrounded by many other vital organs,
p38
aVlike the liver, the stomach, the bile duct.
p39
aVAnd the ability of the tumor to grow into those organs
p40
aVis the reason why pancreatic cancer
p41
aVis one of the most painful tumor types.
p42
aVThe hard-to-reach location also prevents the doctor
p43
aVfrom surgically removing it,
p44
aVas is routinely done for breast cancer, for example.
p45
aVSo all of these reasons leave chemotherapy as the only option
p46
aVfor the pancreatic cancer patient.
p47
aa(lp48
VThis brings us to the second piece of bad news.
p49
aVPancreatic cancer tumors have very few blood vessels.
p50
aVWhy should we care about the blood vessel of a tumor?
p51
aVLet's think for a second how chemotherapy works.
p52
aVThe drug is injected in the vein
p53
aVand it navigates throughout the body until it reaches the tumor site.
p54
aVIt's like driving on a highway, trying to reach a destination.
p55
aVBut what if your destination doesn't have an exit on the highway?
p56
aVYou will never get there.
p57
aVAnd that's exactly the same problem
p58
aVfor chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer.
p59
aVThe drugs navigate throughout all of your body.
p60
aVThey will reach healthy organs,
p61
aVresulting in high toxic effect for the patients overall,
p62
aVbut very little will go to the tumor.
p63
aVTherefore, the efficacy is very limited.
p64
aa(lp65
VTo me, it seems very counterintuitive to have a whole-body treatment
p66
aVto target a specific organ.
p67
aVHowever, in the last 40 years,
p68
aVa lot of money, research and effort have gone towards
p69
aVfinding new, powerful drugs to treat pancreatic cancer,
p70
aVbut nothing has been done in changing the way
p71
aVwe deliver them to the patient.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo after two pieces of bad news,
p74
aVI'm going to give you good news, hopefully.
p75
aVWith a collaborator at MIT
p76
aVand the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston,
p77
aVwe have revolutionized the way we treat cancer
p78
aVby making localized drug delivery a reality.
p79
aVWe are basically parachuting you on top of your destination,
p80
aVavoiding your having to drive all around the highway.
p81
aVWe have embedded the drug into devices that look like this one.
p82
aVThey are flexible enough that they can be folded
p83
aVto fit into the catheter,
p84
aVso the doctor can implant it directly on top of the tumor
p85
aVwith minimally invasive surgery.
p86
aVBut they are solid enough that once they are positioned
p87
aVon top of the tumor,
p88
aVthey will act as a cage.
p89
aVThey will actually physically prevent the tumor
p90
aVfrom entering other organs,
p91
aVcontrolling the metastasis.
p92
aa(lp93
VThe devices are also biodegradable.
p94
aVThat means that once in the body,
p95
aVthey start dissolving,
p96
aVdelivering the drug only locally, slowly and more effectively
p97
aVthan what is done with the current whole-body treatment.
p98
aVIn pre-clinical study, we have demonstrated
p99
aVthat this localized approach
p100
aVis able to improve by 12 times the response to treatment.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo we took a drug that is already known
p103
aVand by just delivering it locally where it's needed the most,
p104
aVwe allow a response that is 12 times more powerful,
p105
aVreducing the systemic toxic effect.
p106
aVWe are working relentlessly to bring this technology to the next level.
p107
aVWe are finalizing the pre-clinical testing
p108
aVand the animal model required prior to asking the FDA for approval
p109
aVfor clinical trials.
p110
aa(lp111
VCurrently, the majority of patients will die from pancreatic cancer.
p112
aVWe are hoping that one day,
p113
aVwe can reduce their pain, extend their life
p114
aVand potentially make pancreatic cancer
p115
aVa curable disease.
p116
aa(lp117
VBy rethinking the way we deliver the drug,
p118
aVwe don't only make it more powerful and less toxic,
p119
aVwe are also opening the door to finding new innovative solutions
p120
aVfor almost all other impossible problems
p121
aVin pancreatic cancer patients and beyond.
p122
aa(lp123
VThank you very much.
