VIt was an incredible surprise to me
p4
aVto find out that there was actually an organization that cared about both parts of my life.
p5
aVBecause, basically,
p6
aVI work as a theoretical physicist.
p7
aVI develop and test models of the Big Bang,
p8
aVusing observational data.
p9
aVAnd I've been moonlighting for the last five years
p10
aVhelping with a project in Africa.
p11
aVAnd, I get a lot of flak for this at Cambridge.
p12
aVPeople wonder, you know, "How do you have time to do this?" And so on.
p13
aVAnd so it was simply astonishing to me
p14
aVto find an organization that actually appreciated both those sides.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo I thought I'd start off by just telling you a little bit about myself
p17
aVand why I lead this schizophrenic life.
p18
aVWell, I was born in South Africa and my parents were imprisoned
p19
aVfor resisting the racist regime.
p20
aVWhen they were released, we left and we went as refugees to Kenya and Tanzania.
p21
aVBoth were very young countries then,
p22
aVand full of hope for the future.
p23
aa(lp24
VWe had an amazing childhood. We didn't have any money,
p25
aVbut we were outdoors most of the time.
p26
aVWe had fantastic friends and we saw the wonders of the world,
p27
aVlike Kilimanjaro, Serengeti and the Olduvai Gorge.
p28
aVWell, then we moved to London for high school.
p29
aVAnd after that \u2014 there's nothing much to say about that.
p30
aVIt was rather dull. But I came back to Africa
p31
aVat the age of 17, as a volunteer teacher
p32
aVto Lesotho, which is a tiny country,
p33
aVsurrounded at that time by apartheid South Africa.
p34
aa(lp35
VWell, 80 percent of the men in Lesotho
p36
aVworked in the mines over the border,
p37
aVin brutal conditions.
p38
aVNevertheless, I \u2014 as I'm sure \u2014 as a rather irritating young, white man
p39
aVcoming into their village, I was welcomed with incredible hospitality and warmth.
p40
aVBut the kids were the best part.
p41
aVThe kids were amazing: extremely eager and often very bright.
p42
aVAnd I'm just going to tell you one story,
p43
aVwhich got through to me.
p44
aa(lp45
VI used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible,
p46
aVto try to connect the academic stuff with the real world.
p47
aVAnd they weren't used to that.
p48
aVBut I took them outside one day and I said,
p49
aV"I want you to estimate the height of the building."
p50
aVAnd I expected them to put a ruler next to the wall,
p51
aVsize it up with a finger, and make an estimate of the height.
p52
aVBut there was one little boy, very small for his age.
p53
aVHe was the son of one of the poorest families in the village.
p54
aVAnd he wasn't doing that. He was scribbling with chalk on the pavement.
p55
aVAnd so, I said \u2014 I was annoyed \u2014 I said, "What are you doing?
p56
aVI want you to estimate the height of the building."
p57
aVHe said, "OK. I measured the height of a brick.
p58
aVI counted the number of bricks and now I'm multiplying."
p59
aVWell \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 I hadn't thought of that one.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd many experiences like this happened to me.
p62
aVAnother one is that I met a miner. He was home on his three-month leave from the mines.
p63
aVSitting next to him one day, he said, "There's only one thing that I really loved at school.
p64
aVAnd you know what it was? Shakespeare." And he recited some to me.
p65
aVAnd these and many similar experiences convinced me
p66
aVthat there are just tons of bright kids in Africa
p67
aV\u2014 inventive kids, intellectual kids \u2014
p68
aVand starved of opportunity.
p69
aVAnd if Africa is going to get fixed, it's by them, not by us.
p70
aVWell, after \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 that's the truth.
p71
aa(lp72
VWell, after Lesotho, I traveled across Africa
p73
aVbefore returning to England
p74
aV\u2014 so gray and depressing, in comparison.
p75
aVAnd I went to Cambridge. And there, I fell for theoretical physics.
p76
aVWell, I'm not going to explain this equation,
p77
aVbut theoretical physics is really an amazing subject.
p78
aVWe can write down all the laws of physics we know in one line.
p79
aVAnd, admittedly, it's in a very shorthand notation.
p80
aVAnd it contains 18 free parameters,
p81
aVOK, which we have to fit to the data.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo it's not the final story,
p84
aVbut it's an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know
p85
aVabout nature at the most basic level.
p86
aVAnd apart from a few very important loose ends, which you've heard about here \u2014
p87
aVlike dark energy and dark matter \u2014
p88
aVthis equation describes,
p89
aVseems to describe everything about the universe and what's in it.
p90
aa(lp91
VBut there's one big puzzle remaining,
p92
aVand this was most succinctly put to me by my primary school math teacher in
p93
aVTanzania, who's a wonderful Scottish lady
p94
aVwho I still stay in touch with.
p95
aVAnd she's now in her 80s.
p96
aVAnd when I try to explain my work to her, she waved away all the details, and she said,
p97
aV"Neil, there's only one question that really matters.
p98
aVWhat banged?" (Laughter)
p99
aV"Everyone talks about the Big Bang. What banged?"
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd she's right. It's a question we've all been avoiding.
p102
aVThe standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence,
p103
aVfull of a strange kind of energy
p104
aV\u2014 inflationary energy \u2014 which blew it up.
p105
aVBut the puzzle of why the universe emerged in that peculiar state
p106
aVis completely unsolved.
p107
aVNow, I worked on that theory for a while, with Stephen Hawking and others.
p108
aVBut then I began to explore another alternative.
p109
aVThe alternative is that the Big Bang wasn't the beginning.
p110
aVPerhaps the universe existed before the bang,
p111
aVand the bang was just a violent event in a pre-existing universe.
p112
aa(lp113
VWell, this possibility is actually suggested
p114
aVby the latest theories, the unified theories,
p115
aVwhich try to explain all those 18 free parameters
p116
aVin a single framework, which will hopefully predict all of them.
p117
aVAnd I'll just share a cartoon of this idea here.
p118
aVIt's all I can convey. According to these theories,
p119
aVthere are extra dimensions of space, not just the three we're familiar with,
p120
aVbut at every point in the room there are more dimensions.
p121
aVAnd in particular, there's one rather strange one,
p122
aVin the most elegant unified theories we have.
p123
aVThe strange one looks likes this:
p124
aVthat we live in a three-dimensional world.
p125
aVWe live in one of these worlds, and I can only show it as a sheet,
p126
aVbut it's really three-dimensional.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd a tiny distance away, there's another sheet,
p129
aValso three-dimensional, and they're separated by a gap.
p130
aVThe gap is very tiny, and I've blown it up so you can see it.
p131
aVBut it's really a tiny fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus.
p132
aVI won't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this,
p133
aVbut it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know.
p134
aVWell, I got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question.
p135
aVWhich is, what happens if these two, three-dimensional worlds
p136
aVshould actually collide?
p137
aVAnd if they collide, it would look a lot like the Big Bang.
p138
aVBut it's slightly different than in the conventional picture.
p139
aVThe conventional picture of the Big Bang is a point.
p140
aVEverything comes out of a point;
p141
aVyou have infinite density. And all the equations break down.
p142
aVNo hope of describing that.
p143
aa(lp144
VIn this picture, you'll notice,
p145
aVthe bang is extended. It's not a point.
p146
aVThe density of matter is finite, and we have a chance
p147
aVof a consistent set of equations that can describe the whole process.
p148
aVSo, to cut a long story short, we've explored this alternative.
p149
aVWe've shown that it can fit
p150
aVall of the data that we have about the formation of galaxies,
p151
aVthe fluctuations in the microwave background.
p152
aVFurthermore, there's an experimental way
p153
aVto tell this theory, apart from the inflationary explanation that I told you before.
p154
aVIt involves gravitational waves.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd in this scenario, not only was the Big Bang not the beginning,
p157
aVas you can see from the picture,
p158
aVit can happen over and over again.
p159
aVIt may be that we live in an endless universe,
p160
aVboth in space and in time.
p161
aVAnd there've been bangs in the past, and there will be bangs in the future.
p162
aVAnd maybe we live in an endless universe.
p163
aVWell, making and testing models of the universe
p164
aVis, for me, the best way I have of enjoying and appreciating the universe.
p165
aVWe need to make the best mathematical models we can,
p166
aVthe most consistent ones.
p167
aVAnd then we scrutinize them, logically and with data.
p168
aVAnd we try to convince ourselves \u2014
p169
aVwe really try to convince ourselves they're wrong.
p170
aVThat's progress: when we prove things wrong.
p171
aVAnd gradually, we hopefully move closer and closer to understanding the world.
p172
aa(lp173
VAs I pursued my career, something was always gnawing away inside me.
p174
aVWhat about Africa?
p175
aVWhat about those kids I'd left behind?
p176
aVInstead of developing, as we'd all hoped in the '60s,
p177
aVthings had gotten worse.
p178
aVAfrica was gripped by poverty, disease and war.
p179
aVThis is very graphically shown by the Worldmapper website and project.
p180
aVAnd so the idea is to represent each country
p181
aVon a map, but scale the area according to some quantity.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo here's just the standard area map of the world.
p184
aVBy the way, Africa is very large.
p185
aVAnd the next map now shows Africa's GDP in 1960,
p186
aVaround the time of independence for many African states.
p187
aVNow, this is 1990, and then 2002. And here's a projection for 2015.
p188
aVBig changes are happening in the world,
p189
aVbut they're not helping Africa.
p190
aa(lp191
VWhat about Africa's population? The population isn't out of proportion to its area,
p192
aVbut Africa leads the world in deaths from often preventable causes:
p193
aVmalnutrition, simple infections and birth complications.
p194
aVThen there's HIV/AIDS. And then there are deaths from war.
p195
aVOK, currently there are 45,000 people a month dying in the Congo,
p196
aVas a consequence of the war
p197
aVthere over coltan and diamonds and other things.
p198
aVIt's still going on.
p199
aa(lp200
VWhat about Africa's capacity to do something about these problems?
p201
aVWell, here's the number of physicians in Africa.
p202
aVHere's the number of people in higher education.
p203
aVAnd here \u2014 most shocking to me \u2014
p204
aVthe number of scientific research papers coming out of Africa.
p205
aVIt just doesn't exist scientifically.
p206
aVAnd this was very eloquently argued at TED Africa:
p207
aVthat all of the aid that's been given
p208
aVhas completely failed to put Africa onto its own two feet.
p209
aa(lp210
VWell, the transition to democracy in South Africa in 1994
p211
aVwas literally a dream come true for many of us.
p212
aVMy parents were both elected to the first parliament,
p213
aValongside Nelson and Winnie Mandela. They were the only other couple.
p214
aVAnd in 2001, I took a research leave to visit them.
p215
aVAnd while I was busy working \u2014 I was working on these colliding worlds, in the day.
p216
aVBut I learned that there was a desperate shortage of skills,
p217
aVespecially mathematical skills, in industry, in government, in education.
p218
aa(lp219
VThe ability to make and test models has become essential,
p220
aVnot only to every single area of science today,
p221
aVbut also to modern society itself.
p222
aVAnd if you don't have math, you're not going to enter the modern age.
p223
aVSo I had an idea. And the idea was very simple.
p224
aVThe idea was to set up an African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, or AIMS.
p225
aVAnd let's recruit students from the whole of Africa,
p226
aVbring them together with lecturers from all over the world,
p227
aVand we'll try to give them a fantastic education.
p228
aa(lp229
VWell, as a Cambridge professor, I had many contacts.
p230
aVAnd to my astonishment, they backed me 100 percent.
p231
aVThey said, "Go and do it,
p232
aVand we'll come and lecture."
p233
aVAnd I knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant students
p234
aVfrom these countries \u2014 where they don't have any opportunities \u2014 together
p235
aVwith the best lecturers in the world \u2014
p236
aVwho I knew would come, because of the interest in Africa \u2014
p237
aVand put them together and just let the sparks fly.
p238
aVSo we bought a derelict hotel near Cape Town.
p239
aVIt's an 80-room Art Deco hotel from the 1920s.
p240
aVThe area was kind of seedy, so we got an 80-room hotel for 100,000 dollars.
p241
aVIt's a beautiful building. We decided we would refurbish it
p242
aVand then put out the word:
p243
aVwe're going to start the best math institute in Africa
p244
aVin this hotel.
p245
aa(lp246
VWell, the new South Africa is a very exciting country.
p247
aVAnd those of you who haven't been there, you should go.
p248
aVIt's very, very interesting what's happening.
p249
aVAnd we recruited wonderful staff,
p250
aVhighly motivated staff.
p251
aVThe other thing that's happened, which was good for us, is the Internet.
p252
aVEven though the Internet is very expensive all over Africa,
p253
aVthere are Internet cafes everywhere.
p254
aVAnd bright young Africans are desperate to join the global community,
p255
aVto be successful \u2014 and they're very ambitious.
p256
aVThey want to be the next Einstein.
p257
aa(lp258
VAnd so when word came out that AIMS was opening,
p259
aVit spread very quickly via e-mail and our website.
p260
aVAnd we got lots of applicants.
p261
aVWell, we designed AIMS as a 24-hour learning environment,
p262
aVand it was fantastic to start a university from the beginning.
p263
aVYou have to rethink, what is the university for?
p264
aVAnd that's really exciting.
p265
aVSo we designed it to have interactive teaching.
p266
aVNo droning on at the chalkboard.
p267
aVWe emphasize problem-solving, working in groups,
p268
aVevery student discovering and maximizing their own potential
p269
aVand not chasing grades.
p270
aa(lp271
VEveryone lives together in this hotel \u2014 lecturers and students \u2014
p272
aVand it's not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at 1 a.m.
p273
aVThe students don't usually leave the computer lab till 2 or 3 a.m.
p274
aVAnd then they're up again at eight in the morning.
p275
aVLectures, problem-solving and so on. It's an extraordinary place.
p276
aVWe especially emphasize areas of great relevance to Africa's development,
p277
aVbecause, in those areas, scientists working in Africa will have a competitive advantage.
p278
aVThey'll publish, be invited to conferences.
p279
aVThey'll do well. They'll have successful careers.
p280
aa(lp281
VAnd AIMS has done extremely well.
p282
aVHere is a list of last year's graduates, graduated in June,
p283
aVand what they're currently doing \u2014 48 of them.
p284
aVAnd where they are is indicated over here.
p285
aVAnd where they've gone. So these are all postgraduate students.
p286
aVAnd they've all gone on to master's and Ph.D. degrees in excellent places.
p287
aVFive students can be educated at AIMS
p288
aVfor the cost of educating one in the U.S. or Europe.
p289
aVBut more important, the pan-African student body
p290
aVis a continual source of strength, pride and commitment to Africa.
p291
aVWe illustrate AIMS' progress by coloring in the countries of Africa.
p292
aa(lp293
VSo here you can see behind this list.
p294
aVWhen a county is colored yellow, we've received an application;
p295
aVorange, we've accepted an application; and green,
p296
aVa student has graduated.
p297
aVSo here is where we were after the first graduation in 2004.
p298
aVAnd we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green.
p299
aVSo there's 2005, -6, -7, -8.
p300
aV(Applause)
p301
aVWe're well on the way to achieving our initial goal.
p302
aa(lp303
VWe had some of the students filmed at home before they came to AIMS.
p304
aVAnd I'll just show you one.
p305
aVTendai Mugwagwa: My name is Tendai Mugwagwa.
p306
aVI have a Bachelor of Science with an education degree.
p307
aVI will be attending AIMS.
p308
aVMy understanding of the course is that it covers quite a lot.
p309
aVYou know, from physics to medicine,
p310
aVin particular, epidemiology and also mathematical modeling.
p311
aVNeil Turok: So Tendai came to AIMS and did very well.
p312
aVAnd I'll let her take it from there.
p313
aa(lp314
VTM: My name is Tendai Mugwagwa
p315
aVand I was a student at AIMS in 2003 and 2004.
p316
aVAfter leaving AIMS, I went on to do a master's in applied mathematics
p317
aVat the University of Cape Town in South Africa.
p318
aVAfter that, I came to the Netherlands
p319
aVwhere I'm now doing a Ph.D. in theoretical immunology.
p320
aa(lp321
VProfessor: Tendai is working very independently.
p322
aVShe communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital.
p323
aVSo all in all I have a very good Ph.D. student from South Africa.
p324
aVSo I'm happy she's here.
p325
aa(lp326
VNT: Another student in the first year of AIMS was Shehu.
p327
aVAnd he's shown here with his favorite high school teacher.
p328
aVAnd then entering university in northern Nigeria.
p329
aVAnd after AIMS, Shehu wanted to do high-energy physics,
p330
aVand he came to Cambridge.
p331
aVHe's about to finish his Ph.D.,
p332
aVand he was filmed recently with someone you all know.
p333
aa(lp334
VShehu: And from there we will be able to,
p335
aVhopefully, make better predictions and then we compare it
p336
aVto the graph and also make some predictions.
p337
aa(lp338
VStephen Hawking: That is nice.
p339
aa(lp340
VNT: Here are the current students at AIMS. There are 53 of them
p341
aVfrom 20 different countries, including 20 women.
p342
aVSo now I'm going to get to my TED business.
p343
aVWell, we had a party. This is Africa \u2014
p344
aVwe have good parties in Africa. And last month, they threw a surprise party for me.
p345
aVHere's somebody you've seen already.
p346
aV(Applause)
p347
aVI want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture.
p348
aVSo, we were having a party,
p349
aVas you can see they're completely eclipsing me at this point.
p350
aVThis is Ezra. She's from Darfur.
p351
aVShe's a physicist, and somehow stays smiling,
p352
aVin spite of everything going on back home.
p353
aVBut she wants to continue in physics, and she's doing extremely well.
p354
aVThis is Lydia. Lydia is the first ever woman
p355
aVto graduate in mathematics in the Central African Republic.
p356
aVAnd she's now at AIMS. (Applause)
p357
aa(lp358
VSo now let me get to our TED wish.
p359
aVWell, it's not my TED wish; it's our wish, as you've already gathered.
p360
aVAnd our wish has two parts:
p361
aVone is a dream and the other's a plan. OK.
p362
aVOur TED dream is that the next Einstein will be African. (Applause)
p363
aVIn striving for the heights of creative genius,
p364
aVwe want to give thousands of people the motivation,
p365
aVthe encouragement and the courage
p366
aVto obtain the high-level skills they need to help Africa.
p367
aVAmong them will be not only brilliant scientists \u2014
p368
aVI'm sure of that from what we've seen at AIMS \u2014
p369
aVthey'll also be the African Gates, Brins and Pages of the future.
p370
aa(lp371
VWell, I said we also have a plan. And our plan is quite simple.
p372
aVAIMS is now a proven model.
p373
aVAnd what we need to do is to replicate it.
p374
aVWe want to roll out 15 AIMS centers in the next five years, all over Africa.
p375
aVEach will have a pan-African student body,
p376
aVbut specialize in a different area of science.
p377
aVWe want to use science to overcome the national and cultural barriers,
p378
aVas it does at AIMS.
p379
aVAnd we want to add elements to the curriculum.
p380
aVWe want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills.
p381
aa(lp382
VThe expanded AIMS will be a coherent pan-African institution,
p383
aVand its graduates will form a powerful network,
p384
aVworking together for peace and progress across the continent.
p385
aVOver the last year,
p386
aVwe've been visiting sites in Africa,
p387
aVlooking at potential sites for new AIMS centers.
p388
aVAnd here are the ones we've selected.
p389
aVAnd each of these centers has a strong local team,
p390
aVeach is in a beautiful place, an interesting place,
p391
aVwhich international lecturers will be happy to visit.
p392
aVAnd our partners across Africa are extremely enthusiastic about this.
p393
aVEveryone wants an AIMS center in their country.
p394
aa(lp395
VAnd last November,
p396
aVthe conference of all the African ministers of science and technology,
p397
aVheld in Mombasa, called for a comprehensive plan to roll out AIMS.
p398
aVSo we have political support right across the continent.
p399
aVIt won't be easy.
p400
aVAt every site there will be huge challenges.
p401
aVLocal scientists must play leading roles
p402
aVand governments must be persuaded to buy in.
p403
aVConditions are very difficult,
