VContagious is a good word.
p4
aVEven in the times of H1N1, I like the word.
p5
aVLaughter is contagious. Passion is contagious.
p6
aVInspiration is contagious.
p7
aVWe've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers.
p8
aVBut for me, what was contagious about all of them
p9
aVwas that they were infected by something I call the
p10
aV"I Can" bug.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo, the question is, why only them?
p13
aVIn a country of a billion people and some,
p14
aVwhy so few?
p15
aVIs it luck? Is it chance?
p16
aVCan we all not systematically and consciously
p17
aVget infected?
p18
aVSo, in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story.
p19
aVI got infected when I was 17,
p20
aVwhen, as a student of the design college,
p21
aVI encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas,
p22
aVchallenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me.
p23
aVAnd I was struck by just how wonderful it felt,
p24
aVand how contagious that feeling was.
p25
aVI also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo, when I started Riverside school 10 years ago it became a lab,
p28
aVa lab to prototype and refine a design process
p29
aVthat could consciously infect the mind with the "I Can" bug.
p30
aVAnd I uncovered
p31
aVthat if learning is embedded in real-world context,
p32
aVthat if you blur the boundaries between school and life,
p33
aVthen children go through a journey of "aware,"
p34
aVwhere they can see the change,
p35
aV"enable," be changed,
p36
aVand then "empower," lead the change.
p37
aVAnd that directly increased student wellbeing.
p38
aVChildren became more competent,
p39
aVand less helpless.
p40
aVBut this was all common sense.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo, I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what
p43
aVcommon practice looks like at Riverside.
p44
aVA little background: when my grade five was learning about child rights,
p45
aVthey were made to roll incense sticks,
p46
aVagarbattis, for eight hours
p47
aVto experience what it means to be a child laborer.
p48
aVIt transformed them. What you will see is their journey,
p49
aVand then their utter conviction
p50
aVthat they could go out and change the world.
p51
aV(Music)
p52
aa(lp53
VThat's them rolling.
p54
aVAnd in two hours, after their backs were broke,
p55
aVthey were changed.
p56
aVAnd once that happened,
p57
aVthey were out in the city convincing everybody
p58
aVthat child labor just had to be abolished.
p59
aVAnd look at Ragav, that moment when his face changes
p60
aVbecause he's been able to understand that he
p61
aVhas shifted that man's mindset.
p62
aVAnd that can't happen in a classroom.
p63
aVSo, when Ragav experienced that
p64
aVhe went from "teacher told me,"
p65
aVto "I am doing it." And that's the "I Can" mindshift.
p66
aVAnd it is a process that can be energized and nurtured.
p67
aa(lp68
VBut we had parents who said,
p69
aV"Okay, making our children good human beings is all very well,
p70
aVbut what about math and science and English?
p71
aVShow us the grades."
p72
aVAnd we did. The data was conclusive.
p73
aVWhen children are empowered,
p74
aVnot only do they do good,
p75
aVthey do well, in fact very well,
p76
aVas you can see in this national benchmarking assessment
p77
aVtaken by over 2,000 schools in India,
p78
aVRiverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India
p79
aVin math, English and science.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo, it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside.
p82
aVSo, on August 15th, Independence Day, 2007,
p83
aVthe children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad.
p84
aVNow it was not about Riverside school.
p85
aVIt was about all children. So, we were shameless.
p86
aVWe walked into the offices of the municipal corporation, the police,
p87
aVthe press, businesses,
p88
aVand basically said, "When are you going to wake up
p89
aVand recognize the potential that resides in every child?
p90
aVWhen will you include the child in the city?
p91
aVBasically, open your hearts and your minds to the child."
p92
aa(lp93
VSo, how did the city respond?
p94
aVSince 2007 every other month
p95
aVthe city closes down the busiest streets for traffic
p96
aVand converts it into a playground for children and childhood.
p97
aVHere was a city telling its child, "You can."
p98
aVA glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad.
p99
aVVideo: [Unclear]
p100
aVSo, the busiest streets closed down.
p101
aVWe have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us.
p102
aVIt gets taken over by children.
p103
aVThey are skating. They are doing street plays.
p104
aVThey are playing, all free, for all children.
p105
aV(Music)
p106
aa(lp107
VAtul Karwal: aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier.
p108
aVAnd we plan to extend this to other parts of the city.
p109
aV(Music)
p110
aa(lp111
VKiran Bir Sethi: And the city will give free time.
p112
aVAnd Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world.
p113
aa(lp114
VGeet Sethi: When a city gives to the children,
p115
aVin the future the children will give back to the city.
p116
aV(Music)
p117
aa(lp118
VKBS: And because of that,
p119
aVAhmedabad is known as India's first child-friendly city.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo, you're getting the pattern. First 200 children at Riverside.
p122
aVThen 30,000 children in Ahmedabad, and growing.
p123
aVIt was time now to infect India.
p124
aVSo, on August 15th,
p125
aVagain, Independence Day, 2009,
p126
aVempowered with the same process,
p127
aVwe empowered 100,000 children to say, "I can."
p128
aVHow? We designed a simple toolkit,
p129
aVconverted it into eight languages,
p130
aVand reached 32,000 schools.
p131
aVWe basically gave children a very simple challenge.
p132
aVWe said, take one idea,
p133
aVanything that bothers you,
p134
aVchoose one week,
p135
aVand change a billion lives.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd they did. Stories of change
p138
aVpoured in from all over India,
p139
aVfrom Nagaland in the east,
p140
aVto Jhunjhunu in the west,
p141
aVfrom Sikkim in the north, to Krishnagiri in the south.
p142
aVChildren were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems.
p143
aVRight from loneliness to filling potholes in the street
p144
aVto alcoholism,
p145
aVand 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages
p146
aVin Rajasthan.
p147
aVI mean, it was incredible.
p148
aVBasically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children
p149
aVand say, "You can," then they will.
p150
aVInfection in India.
p151
aVThis is in Rajasthan, a rural village.
p152
aa(lp153
VChild: Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write.
p154
aVKBS: First time, a rally and a street play in a rural school \u2014
p155
aVunheard of \u2014 to tell their parents why literacy is important.
p156
aVLook at what their parents says.
p157
aa(lp158
VMan: This program is wonderful.
p159
aVWe feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write.
p160
aa(lp161
VWoman: I am so happy that my students did this campaign.
p162
aVIn the future, I will never doubt my students' abilities.
p163
aVSee? They have done it.
p164
aa(lp165
VKBS: An inner city school in Hyderabad.
p166
aVGirl: 581. This house is 581 ...
p167
aa(lp168
VWe have to start collecting from 555.
p169
aa(lp170
VKBS: Girls and boys in Hyderabad, going out,
p171
aVpretty difficult, but they did it.
p172
aa(lp173
VWoman: Even though they are so young, they have done such good work.
p174
aVFirst they have cleaned the society, then it will be Hyderabad, and soon India.
p175
aa(lp176
VWoman: It was a revelation for me. It doesn't strike me
p177
aVthat they had so much inside them.
p178
aa(lp179
VGirl: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
p180
aVFor our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you,
p181
aVfor a very good cause,
p182
aVthe money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids.
p183
aVAre you ready, ladies and gentlemen? Audience: Yes!
p184
aVGirl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!
p185
aVGirl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!
p186
aa(lp187
VKBS: So, the charter of compassion starts right here.
p188
aVStreet plays, auctions, petitions.
p189
aVI mean, they were changing lives.
p190
aVIt was incredible.
p191
aVSo, how can we still stay immune?
p192
aVHow can we stay immune to that passion, that energy, that excitement?
p193
aVI know it's obvious,
p194
aVbut I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change, Gandhiji.
p195
aV70 years ago, it took one man
p196
aVto infect an entire nation
p197
aVwith the power of "We can."
p198
aa(lp199
VSo, today who is it going to take
p200
aVto spread the infection from 100,000 children
p201
aVto the 200 million children in India?
p202
aVLast I heard, the preamble still said, "We, the people of India," right?
p203
aVSo, if not us, then who?
p204
aVIf not now, then when?
p205
aVLike I said, contagious is a good word.
p206
aVThank you.
