VWell, good afternoon.
p4
aVHow many of you
p5
aVtook the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge?
p6
aV(Applause)
p7
aVWoo hoo!
p8
aVWell, I have to tell you, from  the bottom of our hearts,
p9
aVthank you so very, very much.
p10
aVDo you know to date the ALS Association
p11
aVhas raised 125 million dollars?
p12
aVWoo hoo! (Applause)
p13
aa(lp14
VIt takes me back to the summer of 2011.
p15
aVMy family, my kids had all grown up.
p16
aVWe were officially empty nesters,
p17
aVand we decided, let's  go on a family vacation.
p18
aVJenn, my daughter, and my son-in-law
p19
aVcame down from New York.
p20
aVMy youngest, Andrew,
p21
aVhe came down from his home in Charlestown
p22
aVwhere he was working in Boston,
p23
aVand my son Pete,
p24
aVwho had played at  Boston College, baseball,
p25
aVhad played baseball  professionally in Europe,
p26
aVand had now come home and was selling group insurance, he also joined us.
p27
aVAnd one night, I found myself
p28
aVhaving a beer with Pete,
p29
aVand Pete was looking at  me and he just said,
p30
aV"You know, Mom, I don't know,
p31
aVselling group insurance  is just not my passion."
p32
aVHe said, "I just don't feel  I'm living up to my potential.
p33
aVI don't feel this is my mission in life."
p34
aVAnd he said, "You know,  oh by the way, Mom,
p35
aVI have to leave early from vacation
p36
aVbecause my inter-city league team  that I play for made the playoffs,
p37
aVand I have to get back to Boston  because I can't let my team down.
p38
aVI'm just not as passionate about my job
p39
aVas I am about baseball."
p40
aa(lp41
VSo off Pete went, and  left the family vacation \u2014
p42
aVbreak a mother's heart \u2014
p43
aVand he went, and we  followed four days later
p44
aVto see the next playoff game.
p45
aVWe're at the playoff game,  Pete's at the plate,
p46
aVand a fastball's coming in,
p47
aVand it hits him on the wrist.
p48
aVOh, Pete.
p49
aVHis wrist went completely limp, like this.
p50
aVSo for the next six months,
p51
aVPete went back to his home in Southie,
p52
aVkept working that unpassionate job,
p53
aVand was going to doctors
p54
aVto see what was wrong with this wrist
p55
aVthat never came back.
p56
aa(lp57
VSix months later, in March,
p58
aVhe called my husband  and me, and he said,
p59
aV"Oh, Mom and Dad, we have a doctor
p60
aVthat found a diagnosis for that wrist.
p61
aVDo you want to come with the doctor's appointment with me?"
p62
aVI said, "Sure, we'll come in."
p63
aVThat morning, Pete, John and I
p64
aVall got up, got dressed, got in our cars \u2014
p65
aVthree separate cars
p66
aVbecause we were going to go to work
p67
aVafter the doctor's appointment to find out what happened to the wrist.
p68
aVWe walked into the  neurologist's office, sat down,
p69
aVfour doctors walk in,
p70
aVand the head neurologist sits down.
p71
aVAnd he says, "Well, Pete, we've been looking at all the tests,
p72
aVand I have to tell you,  it's not a sprained wrist,
p73
aVit's not a broken wrist,
p74
aVit's not nerve damage in the wrist,
p75
aVit's not an infection,
p76
aVit's not Lyme disease."
p77
aVAnd there was this deliberate  elimination going up,
p78
aVand I was thinking to myself,
p79
aVwhere is he going with this?
p80
aVThen he put his hands on his knees,
p81
aVhe looked right at my  27-year-old kid, and said,
p82
aV"I don't know how to  tell a 27-year-old this:
p83
aVPete, you have ALS."
p84
aVALS?
p85
aVI had had a friend whose  80-year-old father had ALS.
p86
aVI looked at my husband, he looked at me,
p87
aVand then we looked at the  doctor, and we said, "ALS?
p88
aVOkay, what treatment? Let's go.
p89
aVWhat do we do? Let's go."
p90
aVAnd he looked at us, and he said, "Mr. and Mrs. Frates,
p91
aVI'm sorry to tell you this,
p92
aVbut there's no treatment  and there's no cure."
p93
aVWe were the worst culprits.
p94
aVWe didn't even understand
p95
aVthat it had been 75 years since Lou Gehrig
p96
aVand nothing had been done  in the progress against ALS.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo we all went home, and Jenn and Dan
p99
aVflew home from Wall Street,
p100
aVAndrew came home from Charlestown,
p101
aVand Pete went to B.C. to pick up
p102
aVhis then-girlfriend Julie  and brought her home,
p103
aVand six hours later after diagnosis,
p104
aVwe're sitting around  having a family dinner,
p105
aVand we're having small chat.
p106
aVI don't even remember  cooking dinner that night.
p107
aVBut then our leader, Pete, set the vision,
p108
aVand talked to us just like  we were his new team.
p109
aVHe said, "There will be  no wallowing, people."
p110
aVHe goes, "We're not looking back,
p111
aVwe're looking forward.
p112
aVWhat an amazing opportunity  we have to change the world.
p113
aVI'm going to change the face
p114
aVof this unacceptable situation of ALS.
p115
aVWe're going to move the needle,
p116
aVand I'm going to get it in front of philanthropists like Bill Gates."
p117
aVAnd that was it. We  were given our directive.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo in the days and months that followed,
p120
aVwithin a week, we had  our brothers and sisters
p121
aVand our family come to us,
p122
aVthat they were already  creating Team Frate Train.
p123
aVUncle Dave, he was the webmaster;
p124
aVUncle Artie, he was the accountant;
p125
aVAuntie Dana, she was the graphic artist;
p126
aVand my youngest son, Andrew,
p127
aVquit his job, left his  apartment in Charlestown
p128
aVand says, "I'm going to take care  of Pete and be his caregiver."
p129
aVThen all those people,  classmates, teammates,
p130
aVcoworkers that Pete had inspired
p131
aVthroughout his whole life,
p132
aVthe circles of Pete all started intersecting with one another,
p133
aVand made Team Frate Train.
p134
aa(lp135
VSix months after diagnosis,
p136
aVPete was given an award at a  research summit for advocacy.
p137
aVHe got up and gave a very eloquent speech,
p138
aVand at the end of the  speech, there was a panel,
p139
aVand on the panel were these pharmaceutical executives
p140
aVand biochemists and clinicians
p141
aVand I'm sitting there and  I'm listening to them
p142
aVand most of the content  went straight over my head.
p143
aVI avoided every science  class I ever could.
p144
aVBut I was watching these people, and I was listening to them,
p145
aVand they were saying,  "I, I do this, I do that,"
p146
aVand there was a real  unfamiliarity between them.
p147
aVSo at the end of their talk, the panel,
p148
aVthey had questions and answers,
p149
aVand boom, my hand went right up,
p150
aVand I get the microphone,
p151
aVand I look at them and I say, "Thank you.
p152
aVThank you so much for working in ALS.
p153
aVIt means so very much to us."
p154
aVI said, "But I do have to tell you
p155
aVthat I'm watching your body language
p156
aVand I'm listening to what you're saying.
p157
aVIt just doesn't seem like there's a whole  lot of collaboration going on here.
p158
aVAnd not only that, where's the flip chart
p159
aVwith the action items and the  follow-up and the accountability?
p160
aVWhat are you going to do  after you leave this room?"
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd then I turned around
p163
aVand there was about 200 pairs  of eyes just staring at me.
p164
aVAnd it was that point that I realized
p165
aVthat I had talked about  the elephant in the room.
p166
aVThus my mission had begun.
p167
aVSo over the next couple of years,
p168
aVPete \u2014 we've had our highs and our lows.
p169
aVPete was put on a compassionate use drug.
p170
aVIt was hope in a bottle for  the whole ALS community.
p171
aVIt was in a phase III trial.
p172
aVThen six months later, the  data comes back: no efficacy.
p173
aVWe were supposed to  have therapies overseas,
p174
aVand the rug was  pulled out from under us.
p175
aVSo for the next two years,
p176
aVwe just watched my son  be taken away from me,
p177
aVlittle by little every day.
p178
aVTwo and a half years ago,
p179
aVPete was hitting home  runs at baseball fields.
p180
aVToday, Pete's completely paralyzed.
p181
aVHe can't hold his head up any longer.
p182
aVHe's confined to a motorized wheelchair.
p183
aVHe can no longer swallow or eat.
p184
aVHe has a feeding tube.
p185
aVHe can't speak.
p186
aVHe talks with eye gaze technology
p187
aVand a speech generating device,
p188
aVand we're watching his lungs,
p189
aVbecause his diaphragm  eventually is going to give out
p190
aVand then the decision will be made to put him on a ventilator or not.
p191
aVALS robs the human of all their physical  parts, but the brain stays intact.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo July 4th, 2014,
p194
aV75th year of Lou Gehrig's  inspirational speech comes,
p195
aVand Pete is asked by MLB.com to write an article in the Bleacher Report.
p196
aVAnd it was very significant, because he  wrote it using his eye gaze technology.
p197
aa(lp198
VTwenty days later,  the ice started to fall.
p199
aVOn July 27th, Pete's  roommate in New York City,
p200
aVwearing a Quinn For The Win shirt,
p201
aVsignifying Pat Quinn, another  ALS patient known in New York,
p202
aVand B.C. shorts
p203
aVsaid, "I'm taking the ALS  Ice Bucket Challenge,"
p204
aVpicked up the ice, put it over his head.
p205
aV"And I'm nominating ..."  And he sent it up to Boston.
p206
aVAnd that was on July 27th.
p207
aVOver the next couple  of days, our news feed
p208
aVwas full of family and friends.
p209
aVIf you haven't gone back, the nice thing about Facebook
p210
aVis that you have the dates, you can go back.
p211
aVYou've got to see Uncle Artie's  human Bloody Mary.
p212
aVI'm telling you, it's one of the best ones,
p213
aVand that was probably in day two.
p214
aVBy about day four, Uncle  Dave, the webmaster,
p215
aVhe isn't on Facebook,
p216
aVand I get a text from him,  and it says, "Nancy,
p217
aVwhat the hell is going on?"
p218
aVUncle Dave gets a hit  every time Pete's website
p219
aVis gone onto, and his  phone was blowing up.
p220
aVSo we all sat down and we realized,
p221
aVmoney is coming in \u2014 how amazing.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo we knew awareness  would lead to funding,
p224
aVwe just didn't know it would only take a couple of days.
p225
aVSo we got together, put our best  501(c)(3)s on Pete's website,
p226
aVand off we went.
p227
aVSo week one, Boston media.
p228
aVWeek two, national media.
p229
aVIt was during week two  that our neighbor next door
p230
aVopened up our door and threw a pizza
p231
aVacross the kitchen floor, saying,
p232
aV"I think you people might  need food in there."
p233
aV(Laughter)
p234
aVWeek three, celebrities \u2014  Entertainment Tonight,
p235
aVAccess Hollywood.
p236
aVWeek four, global \u2014 BBC, Irish Radio.
p237
aVDid anyone see "Lost In Translation"?
p238
aVMy husband did Japanese television.
p239
aVIt was interesting.
p240
aV(Laughter)
p241
aVAnd those videos, the popular ones.
p242
aVPaul Bissonnette's  glacier video, incredible.
p243
aVHow about the redemption nuns of Dublin?
p244
aVWho's seen that one?
p245
aVIt's absolutely fantastic.
p246
aVJ.T., Justin Timberlake.
p247
aVThat's when we knew, that  was a real A-list celebrity.
p248
aVI go back on my texts, and I can see
p249
aV"JT! JT!" My sister texting me.
p250
aVAngela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany.
p251
aVIncredible.
p252
aVAnd the ALS patients,
p253
aVyou know what their favorite ones are, and their families'?
p254
aVAll of them.
p255
aVBecause this misunderstood and  underfunded "rare" disease,
p256
aVthey just sat and watched people  saying it over and over: "ALS, ALS."
p257
aVIt was unbelievable.
p258
aa(lp259
VAnd those naysayers,
p260
aVlet's just talk a couple  of stats, shall we?
p261
aVOkay, so the ALS Association,
p262
aVthey think by year end, it'll be 160 million dollars.
p263
aVALS TDI in Cambridge,
p264
aVthey raised three million dollars.
p265
aVWell, guess what?
p266
aVThey had a clinical trial for a drug that they've been developing.
p267
aVIt was on a three-year track for funding.
p268
aVTwo months.
p269
aVIt's coming out starting in two months.
p270
aV(Applause)
p271
aVAnd YouTube has reported
p272
aVthat over 150 countries have posted Ice Bucket Challenges for ALS.
p273
aVAnd Facebook, 2.5 million videos,
p274
aVand I had the awesome adventure
p275
aVvisiting the Facebook campus last week,
p276
aVand I said to them, "I know what it was like in my house.
p277
aVI can't imagine what it  was like around here."
p278
aVAll she said was, "Jaw-dropping."
p279
aa(lp280
VAnd my family's favorite video?
p281
aVBill Gates.
p282
aVBecause the night Pete was diagnosed,
p283
aVhe told us that he was going to get ALS in front of philanthropists like Bill Gates,
p284
aVand he did it.
p285
aVGoal number one, check.
p286
aVNow on to the treatment and cure.
p287
aV(Applause)
p288
aa(lp289
VSo okay, after all of this ice,
p290
aVwe know that it was much more
p291
aVthan just pouring buckets of  ice water over your head,
p292
aVand I really would like to leave you
p293
aVwith a couple of things that  I'd like you to remember.
p294
aVThe first thing is,
p295
aVevery morning when you wake up,
p296
aVyou can choose to live your day in positivity.
p297
aVWould any of you blame me
p298
aVif I just was in the fetal position
p299
aVand pulled the covers  over my head every day?
p300
aVNo, I don't think anybody would blame me,
p301
aVbut Pete has inspired us to wake up
p302
aVevery morning and be  positive and proactive.
p303
aVI actually had to ditch support groups
p304
aVbecause everybody was in there saying that
p305
aVspraying their lawns with chemicals,
p306
aVthat's why they got ALS,
p307
aVand I was like, "I don't think so,"
p308
aVbut I had to get away from the negativity.
p309
aa(lp310
VThe second thing I want to leave you with
p311
aVis the person at the  middle of the challenge
p312
aVhas to be willing to have  the mental toughness
p313
aVto put themselves out there.
p314
aVPete still goes to baseball games
p315
aVand he still sits with his  teammates in the dugout,
p316
aVand he hangs his gravity feed bag
p317
aVright on the cages.
p318
aVYou'll see the kids, they're  up there hanging it up.
p319
aV"Pete, is that okay?" "Yup."
p320
aVAnd then they put it  right into his stomach.
p321
aVBecause he wants them to see what the reality of this is,
p322
aVand how he's never, ever going to give up.
p323
aa(lp324
VAnd the third thing I  want to leave you with:
p325
aVIf you ever come across a situation
p326
aVthat you see as so unacceptable,
p327
aVI want you to dig down as deep as you can
p328
aVand find your best mother bear
p329
aVand go after it.
p330
aV(Applause)
p331
aVThank you.
p332
aV(Applause)
p333
aa(lp334
VI know that I'm running over,
p335
aVbut I've got to leave you with this:
p336
aVthe gifts that my son has given me.
p337
aVI have had 29 years
p338
aVof having the honor of being the mother
p339
aVof Pete Frates.
p340
aVPete Frates has been inspiring  and leading his whole life.
p341
aVHe's thrown out kindness,
p342
aVand all that kindness  has come back to him.
p343
aVHe walks the face of the Earth  right now and knows why he's here.
p344
aVWhat a gift.
p345
aa(lp346
VThe second thing that my son has given me
p347
aVis he's given me my mission in life.
p348
aVNow I know why I'm here.
p349
aVI'm going to save my son,
p350
aVand if it doesn't happen in time for him,
p351
aVI'm going to work so that no other mother
p352
aVhas to go through what I'm going through.
p353
aa(lp354
VAnd the third thing,  and last but not least
p355
aVgift that my son has given me,
p356
aVas an exclamation point
p357
aVto the miraculous month
p358
aVof August 2014:
p359
aVThat girlfriend that he went to get on  the night of diagnosis is now his wife,
p360
aVand Pete and Julie have given me my  granddaughter, Lucy Fitzgerald Frates.
p361
aVLucy Fitzgerald Frates came two weeks early
p362
aVas the exclamation point
p363
aVon August 31st, 2014.
p364
aa(lp365
VAnd so \u2014
p366
aV(Applause) \u2014
p367
aVAnd so let me leave you with  Pete's words of inspiration
p368
aVthat he would use to classmates, coworkers and teammates.
p369
aVBe passionate.
p370
aVBe genuine.
p371
aVBe hardworking.
p372
aVAnd don't forget to be great.
p373
aa(lp374
VThank you. (Applause)
