VSo I want to talk today about an idea. It's a big idea.
p4
aVActually, I think it'll eventually
p5
aVbe seen as probably the single biggest idea
p6
aVthat's emerged in the past century.
p7
aVIt's the idea of computation.
p8
aVNow, of course, that idea has brought us
p9
aVall of the computer technology we have today and so on.
p10
aVBut there's actually a lot more to computation than that.
p11
aVIt's really a very deep, very powerful, very fundamental idea,
p12
aVwhose effects we've only just begun to see.
p13
aa(lp14
VWell, I myself have spent the past 30 years of my life
p15
aVworking on three large projects
p16
aVthat really try to take the idea of computation seriously.
p17
aVSo I started off at a young age as a physicist
p18
aVusing computers as tools.
p19
aVThen, I started drilling down,
p20
aVthinking about the computations I might want to do,
p21
aVtrying to figure out what primitives they could be built up from
p22
aVand how they could be automated as much as possible.
p23
aVEventually, I created a whole structure
p24
aVbased on symbolic programming and so on
p25
aVthat let me build Mathematica.
p26
aVAnd for the past 23 years, at an increasing rate,
p27
aVwe've been pouring more and more ideas
p28
aVand capabilities and so on into Mathematica,
p29
aVand I'm happy to say that that's led to many good things
p30
aVin R & D and education,
p31
aVlots of other areas.
p32
aVWell, I have to admit, actually,
p33
aVthat I also had a very selfish reason for building Mathematica:
p34
aVI wanted to use it myself,
p35
aVa bit like Galileo got to use his telescope
p36
aV400 years ago.
p37
aVBut I wanted to look not at the astronomical universe,
p38
aVbut at the computational universe.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo we normally think of programs as being
p41
aVcomplicated things that we build
p42
aVfor very specific purposes.
p43
aVBut what about the space of all possible programs?
p44
aVHere's a representation of a really simple program.
p45
aVSo, if we run this program,
p46
aVthis is what we get.
p47
aVVery simple.
p48
aVSo let's try changing the rule
p49
aVfor this program a little bit.
p50
aVNow we get another result,
p51
aVstill very simple.
p52
aVTry changing it again.
p53
aVYou get something a little bit more complicated.
p54
aVBut if we keep running this for a while,
p55
aVwe find out that although the pattern we get is very intricate,
p56
aVit has a very regular structure.
p57
aVSo the question is: Can anything else happen?
p58
aVWell, we can do a little experiment.
p59
aVLet's just do a little mathematical experiment, try and find out.
p60
aa(lp61
VLet's just run all possible programs
p62
aVof the particular type that we're looking at.
p63
aVThey're called cellular automata.
p64
aVYou can see a lot of diversity in the behavior here.
p65
aVMost of them do very simple things,
p66
aVbut if you look along all these different pictures,
p67
aVat rule number 30,
p68
aVyou start to see something interesting going on.
p69
aVSo let's take a closer look
p70
aVat rule number 30 here.
p71
aVSo here it is.
p72
aVWe're just following this very simple rule at the bottom here,
p73
aVbut we're getting all this amazing stuff.
p74
aVIt's not at all what we're used to,
p75
aVand I must say that, when I first saw this,
p76
aVit came as a huge shock to my intuition.
p77
aVAnd, in fact, to understand it,
p78
aVI eventually had to create
p79
aVa whole new kind of science.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VThis science is different, more general,
p84
aVthan the mathematics-based science that we've had
p85
aVfor the past 300 or so years.
p86
aVYou know, it's always seemed like a big mystery:
p87
aVhow nature, seemingly so effortlessly,
p88
aVmanages to produce so much
p89
aVthat seems to us so complex.
p90
aVWell, I think we've found its secret:
p91
aVIt's just sampling what's out there in the computational universe
p92
aVand quite often getting things like Rule 30
p93
aVor like this.
p94
aVAnd knowing that starts to explain
p95
aVa lot of long-standing mysteries in science.
p96
aVIt also brings up new issues, though,
p97
aVlike computational irreducibility.
p98
aVI mean, we're used to having science let us predict things,
p99
aVbut something like this
p100
aVis fundamentally irreducible.
p101
aVThe only way to find its outcome
p102
aVis, effectively, just to watch it evolve.
p103
aVIt's connected to, what I call,
p104
aVthe principle of computational equivalence,
p105
aVwhich tells us that even incredibly simple systems
p106
aVcan do computations as sophisticated as anything.
p107
aVIt doesn't take lots of technology or biological evolution
p108
aVto be able to do arbitrary computation;
p109
aVjust something that happens, naturally,
p110
aVall over the place.
p111
aVThings with rules as simple as these can do it.
p112
aVWell, this has deep implications
p113
aVabout the limits of science,
p114
aVabout predictability and controllability
p115
aVof things like biological processes or economies,
p116
aVabout intelligence in the universe,
p117
aVabout questions like free will
p118
aVand about creating technology.
p119
aa(lp120
VYou know, in working on this science for many years,
p121
aVI kept wondering,
p122
aV"What will be its first killer app?"
p123
aVWell, ever since I was a kid,
p124
aVI'd been thinking about systematizing knowledge
p125
aVand somehow making it computable.
p126
aVPeople like Leibniz had wondered about that too
p127
aV300 years earlier.
p128
aVBut I'd always assumed that to make progress,
p129
aVI'd essentially have to replicate a whole brain.
p130
aVWell, then I got to thinking:
p131
aVThis scientific paradigm of mine suggests something different \u2014
p132
aVand, by the way, I've now got
p133
aVhuge computation capabilities in Mathematica,
p134
aVand I'm a CEO with some worldly resources
p135
aVto do large, seemingly crazy, projects \u2014
p136
aVSo I decided to just try to see
p137
aVhow much of the systematic knowledge that's out there in the world
p138
aVwe could make computable.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo, it's been a big, very complex project,
p141
aVwhich I was not sure was going to work at all.
p142
aVBut I'm happy to say it's actually going really well.
p143
aVAnd last year we were able
p144
aVto release the first website version
p145
aVof Wolfram Alpha.
p146
aVIts purpose is to be a serious knowledge engine
p147
aVthat computes answers to questions.
p148
aVSo let's give it a try.
p149
aVLet's start off with something really easy.
p150
aVHope for the best.
p151
aVVery good. Okay.
p152
aVSo far so good.
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aVLet's try something a little bit harder.
p155
aVLet's do
p156
aVsome mathy thing,
p157
aVand with luck it'll work out the answer
p158
aVand try and tell us some interesting things
p159
aVthings about related math.
p160
aVWe could ask it something about the real world.
p161
aVLet's say \u2014 I don't know \u2014
p162
aVwhat's the GDP of Spain?
p163
aVAnd it should be able to tell us that.
p164
aVNow we could compute something related to this,
p165
aVlet's say ... the GDP of Spain
p166
aVdivided by, I don't know,
p167
aVthe \u2014 hmmm ...
p168
aVlet's say the revenue of Microsoft.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter)
p171
aa(lp172
VThe idea is that we can just type this in,
p173
aVthis kind of question in, however we think of it.
p174
aVSo let's try asking a question,
p175
aVlike a health related question.
p176
aVSo let's say we have a lab finding that ...
p177
aVyou know, we have an LDL level of 140
p178
aVfor a male aged 50.
p179
aVSo let's type that in, and now Wolfram Alpha
p180
aVwill go and use available public health data
p181
aVand try and figure out
p182
aVwhat part of the population that corresponds to and so on.
p183
aVOr let's try asking about, I don't know,
p184
aVthe International Space Station.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd what's happening here is that
p187
aVWolfram Alpha is not just looking up something;
p188
aVit's computing, in real time,
p189
aVwhere the International Space Station is right now at this moment,
p190
aVhow fast it's going, and so on.
p191
aVSo Wolfram Alpha knows about lots and lots of kinds of things.
p192
aVIt's got, by now,
p193
aVpretty good coverage of everything you might find
p194
aVin a standard reference library.
p195
aVBut the goal is to go much further
p196
aVand, very broadly, to democratize
p197
aVall of this knowledge,
p198
aVand to try and be an authoritative
p199
aVsource in all areas.
p200
aVTo be able to compute answers to specific questions that people have,
p201
aVnot by searching what other people
p202
aVmay have written down before,
p203
aVbut by using built in knowledge
p204
aVto compute fresh new answers to specific questions.
p205
aa(lp206
VNow, of course, Wolfram Alpha
p207
aVis a monumentally huge, long-term project
p208
aVwith lots and lots of challenges.
p209
aVFor a start, one has to curate a zillion
p210
aVdifferent sources of facts and data,
p211
aVand we built quite a pipeline of Mathematica automation
p212
aVand human domain experts for doing this.
p213
aVBut that's just the beginning.
p214
aVGiven raw facts or data
p215
aVto actually answer questions,
p216
aVone has to compute:
p217
aVone has to implement all those methods and models
p218
aVand algorithms and so on
p219
aVthat science and other areas have built up over the centuries.
p220
aVWell, even starting from Mathematica,
p221
aVthis is still a huge amount of work.
p222
aVSo far, there are about 8 million lines
p223
aVof Mathematica code in Wolfram Alpha
p224
aVbuilt by experts from many, many different fields.
p225
aa(lp226
VWell, a crucial idea of Wolfram Alpha
p227
aVis that you can just ask it questions
p228
aVusing ordinary human language,
p229
aVwhich means that we've got to be able to take
p230
aVall those strange utterances that people type into the input field
p231
aVand understand them.
p232
aVAnd I must say that I thought that step
p233
aVmight just be plain impossible.
p234
aVTwo big things happened:
p235
aVFirst, a bunch of new ideas about linguistics
p236
aVthat came from studying the computational universe;
p237
aVand second, the realization that having actual computable knowledge
p238
aVcompletely changes how one can
p239
aVset about understanding language.
p240
aVAnd, of course, now
p241
aVwith Wolfram Alpha actually out in the wild,
p242
aVwe can learn from its actual usage.
p243
aVAnd, in fact, there's been
p244
aVan interesting coevolution that's been going on
p245
aVbetween Wolfram Alpha
p246
aVand its human users,
p247
aVand it's really encouraging.
p248
aVRight now, if we look at web queries,
p249
aVmore than 80 percent of them get handled successfully the first time.
p250
aVAnd if you look at things like the iPhone app,
p251
aVthe fraction is considerably larger.
p252
aVSo, I'm pretty pleased with it all.
p253
aa(lp254
VBut, in many ways,
p255
aVwe're still at the very beginning with Wolfram Alpha.
p256
aVI mean, everything is scaling up very nicely
p257
aVand we're getting more confident.
p258
aVYou can expect to see Wolfram Alpha technology
p259
aVshowing up in more and more places,
p260
aVworking both with this kind of public data, like on the website,
p261
aVand with private knowledge
p262
aVfor people and companies and so on.
p263
aVYou know, I've realized that Wolfram Alpha actually gives one
p264
aVa whole new kind of computing
p265
aVthat one can call knowledge-based computing,
p266
aVin which one's starting not just from raw computation,
p267
aVbut from a vast amount of built-in knowledge.
p268
aVAnd when one does that, one really changes
p269
aVthe economics of delivering computational things,
p270
aVwhether it's on the web or elsewhere.
p271
aa(lp272
VYou know, we have a fairly interesting situation right now.
p273
aVOn the one hand, we have Mathematica,
p274
aVwith its sort of precise, formal language
p275
aVand a huge network
p276
aVof carefully designed capabilities
p277
aVable to get a lot done in just a few lines.
p278
aVLet me show you a couple of examples here.
p279
aVSo here's a trivial piece of Mathematica programming.
p280
aVHere's something where we're sort of
p281
aVintegrating a bunch of different capabilities here.
p282
aVHere we'll just create, in this line,
p283
aVa little user interface that allows us to
p284
aVdo something fun there.
p285
aVIf you go on, that's a slightly more complicated program
p286
aVthat's now doing all sorts of algorithmic things
p287
aVand creating user interface and so on.
p288
aVBut it's something that is very precise stuff.
p289
aVIt's a precise specification with a precise formal language
p290
aVthat causes Mathematica to know what to do here.
p291
aa(lp292
VThen on the other hand, we have Wolfram Alpha,
p293
aVwith all the messiness of the world
p294
aVand human language and so on built into it.
p295
aVSo what happens when you put these things together?
p296
aVI think it's actually rather wonderful.
p297
aVWith Wolfram Alpha inside Mathematica,
p298
aVyou can, for example, make precise programs
p299
aVthat call on real world data.
p300
aVHere's a real simple example.
p301
aVYou can also just sort of give vague input
p302
aVand then try and have Wolfram Alpha
p303
aVfigure out what you're talking about.
p304
aVLet's try this here.
p305
aVBut actually I think the most exciting thing about this
p306
aVis that it really gives one the chance
p307
aVto democratize programming.
p308
aVI mean, anyone will be able to say what they want in plain language.
p309
aVThen, the idea is that Wolfram Alpha will be able to figure out
p310
aVwhat precise pieces of code
p311
aVcan do what they're asking for
p312
aVand then show them examples that will let them pick what they need
p313
aVto build up bigger and bigger, precise programs.
p314
aVSo, sometimes, Wolfram Alpha
p315
aVwill be able to do the whole thing immediately
p316
aVand just give back a whole big program that you can then compute with.
p317
aVHere's a big website
p318
aVwhere we've been collecting lots of educational
p319
aVand other demonstrations about lots of kinds of things.
p320
aVI'll show you one example here.
p321
aVThis is just an example of one of these computable documents.
p322
aVThis is probably a fairly small
p323
aVpiece of Mathematica code
p324
aVthat's able to be run here.
p325
aa(lp326
VOkay. Let's zoom out again.
p327
aVSo, given our new kind of science,
p328
aVis there a general way to use it to make technology?
p329
aVSo, with physical materials,
p330
aVwe're used to going around the world
p331
aVand discovering that particular materials
p332
aVare useful for particular
p333
aVtechnological purposes.
p334
aVWell, it turns out we can do very much the same kind of thing
p335
aVin the computational universe.
p336
aVThere's an inexhaustible supply of programs out there.
p337
aVThe challenge is to see how to
p338
aVharness them for human purposes.
p339
aVSomething like Rule 30, for example,
p340
aVturns out to be a really good randomness generator.
p341
aVOther simple programs are good models
p342
aVfor processes in the natural or social world.
p343
aVAnd, for example, Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica
p344
aVare actually now full of algorithms
p345
aVthat we discovered by searching the computational universe.
p346
aVAnd, for example, this \u2014 if we go back here \u2014
p347
aVthis has become surprisingly popular
p348
aVamong composers
p349
aVfinding musical forms by searching the computational universe.
p350
aVIn a sense, we can use the computational universe
p351
aVto get mass customized creativity.
p352
aVI'm hoping we can, for example,
p353
aVuse that even to get Wolfram Alpha
p354
aVto routinely do invention and discovery on the fly,
p355
aVand to find all sorts of wonderful stuff
p356
aVthat no engineer
p357
aVand no process of incremental evolution would ever come up with.
p358
aa(lp359
VWell, so, that leads to kind of an ultimate question:
p360
aVCould it be that someplace out there in the computational universe
p361
aVwe might find our physical universe?
p362
aVPerhaps there's even some quite simple rule,
p363
aVsome simple program for our universe.
p364
aVWell, the history of physics would have us believe
p365
aVthat the rule for the universe must be pretty complicated.
p366
aVBut in the computational universe,
p367
aVwe've now seen how rules that are incredibly simple
p368
aVcan produce incredibly rich and complex behavior.
p369
aVSo could that be what's going on with our whole universe?
p370
aVIf the rules for the universe are simple,
p371
aVit's kind of inevitable that they have to be
p372
aVvery abstract and very low level;
p373
aVoperating, for example, far below
p374
aVthe level of space or time,
p375
aVwhich makes it hard to represent things.
p376
aVBut in at least a large class of cases,
p377
aVone can think of the universe as being
p378
aVlike some kind of network,
p379
aVwhich, when it gets big enough,
p380
aVbehaves like continuous space
p381
aVin much the same way as having lots of molecules
p382
aVcan behave like a continuous fluid.
p383
aVWell, then the universe has to evolve by applying
p384
aVlittle rules that progressively update this network.
p385
aVAnd each possible rule, in a sense,
p386
aVcorresponds to a candidate universe.
p387
aa(lp388
VActually, I haven't shown these before,
p389
aVbut here are a few of the candidate universes
p390
aVthat I've looked at.
p391
aVSome of these are hopeless universes,
p392
aVcompletely sterile,
p393
aVwith other kinds of pathologies like no notion of space,
p394
aVno notion of time, no matter,
p395
aVother problems like that.
p396
aVBut the exciting thing that I've found in the last few years
p397
aVis that you actually don't have to go very far
p398
aVin the computational universe
p399
aVbefore you start finding candidate universes
p400
aVthat aren't obviously not our universe.
p401
aVHere's the problem:
p402
aVAny serious candidate for our universe
p403
aVis inevitably full of computational irreducibility.
p404
aVWhich means that it is irreducibly difficult
p405
aVto find out how it will really behave,
p406
aVand whether it matches our physical universe.
p407
aVA few years ago, I was pretty excited to discover
p408
aVthat there are candidate universes with incredibly simple rules
p409
aVthat successfully reproduce special relativity,
p410
aVand even general relativity and gravitation,
p411
aVand at least give hints of quantum mechanics.
p412
aVSo, will we find the whole of physics?
p413
aVI don't know for sure,
p414
aVbut I think at this point it's sort of
p415
aValmost embarrassing not to at least try.
p416
aa(lp417
VNot an easy project.
p418
aVOne's got to build a lot of technology.
p419
aVOne's got to build a structure that's probably
p420
aVat least as deep as existing physics.
p421
aVAnd I'm not sure what the best way to organize the whole thing is.
p422
aVBuild a team, open it up, offer prizes and so on.
p423
aVBut I'll tell you, here today,
p424
aVthat I'm committed to seeing this project done,
p425
aVto see if, within this decade,
p426
aVwe can finally hold in our hands
p427
aVthe rule for our universe
p428
aVand know where our universe lies
p429
aVin the space of all possible universes ...
p430
aVand be able to type into Wolfram Alpha, "the theory of the universe,"
p431
aVand have it tell us.
p432
aa(lp433
V(Laughter)
p434
aa(lp435
VSo I've been working on the idea of computation
p436
aVnow for more than 30 years,
p437
aVbuilding tools and methods and turning intellectual ideas
p438
aVinto millions of lines of code
p439
aVand grist for server farms and so on.
p440
aVWith every passing year,
p441
aVI realize how much more powerful
p442
aVthe idea of computation really is.
p443
aVIt's taken us a long way already,
p444
aVbut there's so much more to come.
p445
aVFrom the foundations of science
p446
aVto the limits of technology
p447
aVto the very definition of the human condition,
p448
aVI think computation is destined to be
p449
aVthe defining idea of our future.
p450
aa(lp451
VThank you.
p452
aa(lp453
V(Applause)
p454
aa(lp455
VChris Anderson: That was astonishing.
p456
aVStay here. I've got a question.
p457
aa(lp458
V(Applause)
p459
aa(lp460
VSo, that was, fair to say, an astonishing talk.
p461
aVAre you able to say in a sentence or two
p462
aVhow this type of thinking
p463
aVcould integrate at some point
p464
aVto things like string theory or the kind of things that people think of
p465
aVas the fundamental explanations of the universe?
p466
aa(lp467
VStephen Wolfram: Well, the parts of physics
p468
aVthat we kind of know to be true,

aVthings like the standard model of physics:
p470
aVwhat I'm trying to do better reproduce the standard model of physics
p471
aVor it's simply wrong.
p472
aVThe things that people have tried to do in the last 25 years or so
p473
aVwith string theory and so on
p474
aVhave been an interesting exploration
p475
aVthat has tried to get back to the standard model,
p476
aVbut hasn't quite gotten there.
p477
aVMy guess is that some great simplifications of what I'm doing
p478
aVmay actually have considerable resonance
p479
aVwith what's been done in string theory,
p480
aVbut that's a complicated math thing
p481
aVthat I don't yet know how it's going to work out.

VCA: Benoit Mandelbrot is in the audience.
p484
aVHe also has shown how complexity
p485
aVcan arise out of a simple start.
p486
aVDoes your work relate to his?
p487
aa(lp488
VSW: I think so.

aVI view Benoit Mandelbrot's work
p490
aVas one of the founding contributions
p491
aVto this kind of area.
p492
aVBenoit has been particularly interested
p493
aVin nested patterns, in fractals and so on,
p494
aVwhere the structure is something
p495
aVthat's kind of tree-like,
p496
aVand where there's sort of a big branch that makes little branches
p497
aVand even smaller branches and so on.
p498
aVThat's one of the ways
p499
aVthat you get towards true complexity.
p500
aVI think things like the Rule 30 cellular automaton
p501
aVget us to a different level.
p502
aVIn fact, in a very precise way, they get us to a different level
p503
aVbecause they seem to be things that are
p504
aVcapable of complexity
p505
aVthat's sort of as great as complexity can ever get ...
