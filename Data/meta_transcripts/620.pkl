VI'm going to talk about your mindset.
p4
aVDoes your mindset correspond to my dataset?
p5
aV(Laughter)
p6
aVIf not, one or the other needs upgrading, isn't it?
p7
aa(lp8
VWhen I talk to my students about global issues,
p9
aVand I listen to them in the coffee break,
p10
aVthey always talk about "we" and "them."
p11
aVAnd when they come back into the lecture room
p12
aVI ask them, "What do you mean with "we" and "them"?
p13
aV"Oh, it's very easy. It's the western world and it's the developing world," they say.
p14
aV"We learned it in college."
p15
aVAnd what is the definition then? "The definition?
p16
aVEveryone knows," they say.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut then you know, I press them like this.
p19
aVSo one girl said, very cleverly, "It's very easy.
p20
aVWestern world is a long life in a small family.
p21
aVDeveloping world is a short life in a large family."
p22
aVAnd I like that definition, because it enabled me
p23
aVto transfer their mindset
p24
aVinto the dataset.
p25
aVAnd here you have the dataset.
p26
aVSo, you can see that what we have on this axis here
p27
aVis size of family. One, two, three, four, five
p28
aVchildren per woman on this axis.
p29
aVAnd here, length of life, life expectancy,
p30
aV30, 40, 50.
p31
aVExactly what the students said was their concept about the world.
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd really this is about the bedroom.
p34
aVWhether the man and woman decide to have small family,
p35
aVand take care of their kids, and how long they will live.
p36
aVIt's about the bathroom and the kitchen. If you have soap, water and food, you know,
p37
aVyou can live long.
p38
aVAnd the students were right. It wasn't that the world consisted \u2014
p39
aVthe world consisted here, of one set of countries over here,
p40
aVwhich had large families and short life. Developing world.
p41
aVAnd we had one set of countries up there
p42
aVwhich was the western world.
p43
aVThey had small families and long life.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd you are going to see here
p46
aVthe amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime.
p47
aVThen the developing countries applied
p48
aVsoap and water, vaccination.
p49
aVAnd all the developing world started to apply family planning.
p50
aVAnd partly to USA who help to provide
p51
aVtechnical advice and investment.
p52
aVAnd you see all the world moves over to a two child family,
p53
aVand a life with 60 to 70 years.
p54
aa(lp55
VBut some countries remain back in this area here.
p56
aVAnd you can see we still have Afghanistan down here.
p57
aVWe have Liberia. We have Congo.
p58
aVSo we have countries living there.
p59
aVSo the problem I had
p60
aVis that the worldview that my students had
p61
aVcorresponds to reality in the world
p62
aVthe year their teachers were born.
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aV(Applause)
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd we, in fact, when we have played this over the world.
p67
aVI was at the Global Health Conference here in Washington last week,
p68
aVand I could see the wrong concept
p69
aVeven active people in United States had,
p70
aVthat they didn't realize the improvement
p71
aVof Mexico there, and China, in relation to United States.
p72
aVLook here when I move them forward.
p73
aVHere we go.
p74
aVThey catch up. There's Mexico.
p75
aVIt's on par with United States in these two social dimensions.
p76
aVThere was less than five percent
p77
aVof the specialists in Global Health that was aware of this.
p78
aVThis great nation, Mexico,
p79
aVhas the problem that arms are coming from North,
p80
aVacross the borders, so they had to stop that,
p81
aVbecause they have this strange relationship to the United States, you know.
p82
aa(lp83
VBut if I would change this axis here,
p84
aVI would instead put income per person.
p85
aVIncome per person. I can put that here.
p86
aVAnd we will then see
p87
aVa completely different picture.
p88
aVBy the way, I'm teaching you
p89
aVhow to use our website, Gapminder World,
p90
aVwhile I'm correcting this,
p91
aVbecause this is a free utility on the net.
p92
aVAnd when I now finally got it right,
p93
aVI can go back 200 years in history.
p94
aVAnd I can find United States up there.
p95
aVAnd I can let the other countries be shown.
p96
aVAnd now I have income per person on this axis.
p97
aVAnd United States only had some, one, two thousand dollars at that time.
p98
aVAnd the life expectancy was 35 to 40 years,
p99
aVon par with Afghanistan today.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd what has happened in the world, I will show now.
p102
aVThis is instead of studying history
p103
aVfor one year at university.
p104
aVYou can watch me for one minute now and you'll see the whole thing.
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aVYou can see how the brown bubbles, which is west Europe,
p107
aVand the yellow one, which is the United States,
p108
aVthey get richer and richer and also
p109
aVstart to get healthier and healthier.
p110
aVAnd this is now 100 years ago,
p111
aVwhere the rest of the world remains behind.
p112
aVHere we come. And that was the influenza.
p113
aVThat's why we are so scared about flu, isn't it?
p114
aVIt's still remembered. The fall of life expectancy.
p115
aVAnd then we come up. Not until
p116
aVindependence started.
p117
aa(lp118
VLook here You have China over there,
p119
aVyou have India over there,
p120
aVand this is what has happened.
p121
aVDid you note there, that we have Mexico up there?
p122
aVMexico is not at all on par with the United States,
p123
aVbut they are quite close.
p124
aVAnd especially, it's interesting to see
p125
aVChina and the United States
p126
aVduring 200 years,
p127
aVbecause I have my oldest son now working for Google,
p128
aVafter Google acquired this software.
p129
aVBecause in fact, this is child labor. My son and his wife sat in a closet
p130
aVfor many years and developed this.
p131
aVAnd my youngest son, who studied Chinese in Beijing.
p132
aVSo they come in with the two perspectives I have, you know?
p133
aVAnd my son, youngest son who studied in Beijing,
p134
aVin China, he got a long-term perspective.
p135
aVWhereas when my oldest son, who works for Google,
p136
aVhe should develop by quarter, or by half-year.
p137
aVOr Google is quite generous, so he can have one or two years to go.
p138
aa(lp139
VBut in China they look generation after generation
p140
aVbecause they remember
p141
aVthe very embarrassing period, for 100 years,
p142
aVwhen they went backwards.
p143
aVAnd then they would remember the first part
p144
aVof last century, which was really bad,
p145
aVand we could go by this so-called Great Leap Forward.
p146
aVBut this was 1963.
p147
aVMao Tse-Tung eventually brought health to China,
p148
aVand then he died, and then Deng Xiaoping started
p149
aVthis amazing move forward.
p150
aa(lp151
VIsn't it strange to see that the United States
p152
aVfirst grew the economy, and then gradually got rich?
p153
aVWhereas China could get healthy much earlier,
p154
aVbecause they applied the knowledge of education, nutrition,
p155
aVand then also benefits of penicillin
p156
aVand vaccines and family planning.
p157
aVAnd Asia could have social development
p158
aVbefore they got the economic development.
p159
aVSo to me, as a public health professor,
p160
aVit's not strange that all these countries grow so fast now.
p161
aa(lp162
VBecause what you see here, what you see here
p163
aVis the flat world of Thomas Friedman,
p164
aVisn't it.
p165
aVIt's not really, really flat.
p166
aVBut the middle income countries \u2014
p167
aVand this is where I suggest to my students,
p168
aVstop using the concept "developing world."
p169
aVBecause after all, talking about the developing world
p170
aVis like having two chapters in the history of the United States.
p171
aa(lp172
VThe last chapter is about present, and president Obama,
p173
aVand the other is about the past,
p174
aVwhere you cover everything from Washington
p175
aVto Eisenhower.
p176
aVBecause Washington to Eisenhower,
p177
aVthat is what we find in the developing world.
p178
aVWe could actually go to Mayflower
p179
aVto Eisenhower,
p180
aVand that would be put together into a developing world,
p181
aVwhich is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way,
p182
aVwhich have great entrepreneurs,
p183
aVbut also have the collapsing countries.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo, how could we make better sense about this?
p186
aVWell, one way of trying is to see whether we could
p187
aVlook at income distribution.
p188
aVThis is the income distribution of peoples in the world,
p189
aVfrom $1. This is where you have food to eat.
p190
aVThese people go to bed hungry.
p191
aVAnd this is the number of people.
p192
aVThis is $10, whether you have a public or a private
p193
aVhealth service system. This is where you can
p194
aVprovide health service for your family and school for your children,
p195
aVand this is OECD countries:
p196
aVGreen, Latin America, East Europe.
p197
aVThis is East Asia, and the light blue there is South Asia.
p198
aa(lp199
VAnd this is how the world changed.
p200
aVIt changed like this.
p201
aVCan you see how it's growing? And how hundreds of millions
p202
aVand billions is coming out of poverty in Asia?
p203
aVAnd it goes over here?
p204
aVAnd I come now, into projections,
p205
aVbut I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there, you know, because \u2014
p206
aV(Laughter)
p207
aVthat's where the projections are not valid any longer.
p208
aVProbably the world will do this.
p209
aVand then it will continue forward like this.
p210
aVBut more or less, this is what will happen,
p211
aVand we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided.
p212
aa(lp213
VWe have the high income countries here,
p214
aVwith the United States as a leading power;
p215
aVwe have the emerging economies in the middle,
p216
aVwhich provide a lot of the funding for the bailout;
p217
aVand we have the low income countries here.
p218
aVYeah, this is a fact that from where the money comes,
p219
aVthey have been saving, you know, over the last decade.
p220
aVAnd here we have the low income countries
p221
aVwhere entrepreneurs are.
p222
aVAnd here we have the countries in collapse and war,
p223
aVlike Afghanistan, Somalia, parts of Congo, Darfur.
p224
aVWe have all this at the same time.
p225
aa(lp226
VThat's why it's so problematic to describe what has happened
p227
aVin the developing world.
p228
aVBecause it's so different, what has happened there.
p229
aVAnd that's why I suggest
p230
aVa slightly different approach of what you would call it.
p231
aVAnd you have huge differences within countries also.
p232
aVI heard that your departments here were by regions.
p233
aVHere you have Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia,
p234
aVEast Asia, Arab states,
p235
aVEast Europe, Latin America, and OECD.
p236
aVAnd on this axis, GDP.
p237
aVAnd on this, heath, child survival,
p238
aVand it doesn't come as a surprise
p239
aVthat Africa south of Sahara is at the bottom.
p240
aa(lp241
VBut when I split it, when I split it
p242
aVinto country bubbles,
p243
aVthe size of the bubbles here is the population.
p244
aVThen you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius, completely different.
p245
aVThere is such a difference within Sub-Saharan Africa.
p246
aVAnd I can split the others. Here is the South Asian,
p247
aVArab world.
p248
aVNow all your different departments.
p249
aVEast Europe, Latin America, and OECD countries.
p250
aVAnd here were are. We have a continuum in the world.
p251
aVWe cannot put it into two parts.
p252
aa(lp253
VIt is Mayflower down here. It is Washington here,
p254
aVbuilding, building countries.
p255
aVIt's Lincoln here, advancing them.
p256
aVIt's Eisenhower bringing modernity into the countries.
p257
aVAnd then it's United States today, up here.
p258
aVAnd we have countries all this way.
p259
aVNow, this is the important thing
p260
aVof understanding how the world has changed.
p261
aVAt this point I decided to make a pause.
p262
aV(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd it is my task, on behalf of the rest of the world,
p265
aVto convey a thanks to the U.S. taxpayers,
p266
aVfor Demographic Health Survey.
p267
aVMany are not aware of \u2014 no, this is not a joke.
p268
aVThis is very serious.
p269
aVIt is due to USA's continuous sponsoring
p270
aVduring 25 years of the very good methodology
p271
aVfor measuring child mortality
p272
aVthat we have a grasp of what's happening in the world.
p273
aV(Applause)
p274
aVAnd it is U.S. government at its best,
p275
aVwithout advocacy, providing facts,
p276
aVthat it's useful for the society.
p277
aVAnd providing data free of charge
p278
aVon the internet, for the world to use. Thank you very much.
p279
aa(lp280
VQuite the opposite of the World Bank,
p281
aVwho compiled data with government money,
p282
aVtax money, and then they sell it to add a little profit,
p283
aVin a very inefficient, Gutenberg way.
p284
aV(Applause)
p285
aVBut the people doing that at the World Bank
p286
aVare among the best in the world.
p287
aVAnd they are highly skilled professionals.
p288
aVIt's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies
p289
aVto deal with the world in the modern way, as we do.
p290
aVAnd when it comes to free data and transparency,
p291
aVUnited States of America is one of the best.
p292
aVAnd that doesn't come easy from the mouth of a Swedish public health professor.
p293
aV(Laughter)
p294
aVAnd I'm not paid to come here, no.
p295
aa(lp296
VI would like to show you what happens with the data,
p297
aVwhat we can show with this data.
p298
aVLook here. This is the world.
p299
aVWith income down there and child mortality.
p300
aVAnd what has happened in the world?
p301
aVSince 1950, during the last 50 years
p302
aVwe have had a fall in child mortality.
p303
aVAnd it is the DHS that makes it possible to know this.
p304
aVAnd we had an increase in income.
p305
aVAnd the blue former developing countries
p306
aVare mixing up with the former industrialized western world.
p307
aVWe have a continuum. But we still have, of course,
p308
aVCongo, up there. We still have as poor countries
p309
aVas we have had, always, in history.
p310
aVAnd that's the bottom billion, where we've heard today
p311
aVabout a completely new approach to do it.
p312
aa(lp313
VAnd how fast has this happened?
p314
aVWell, MDG 4.
p315
aVThe United States has not been so eager
p316
aVto use MDG 4.
p317
aVBut you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it,
p318
aVbecause it's the only child mortality that we can measure.
p319
aVAnd we used to say that it should fall four percent per year.
p320
aVLet's see what Sweden has done.
p321
aVWe used to boast about fast social progress.
p322
aVThat's where we were, 1900.
p323
aV1900, Sweden was there.
p324
aVSame child mortality as Bangladesh had, 1990,
p325
aVthough they had lower income.
p326
aVThey started very well. They used the aid well.
p327
aVThey vaccinated the kids. They get better water.
p328
aVAnd they reduced child mortality,
p329
aVwith an amazing 4.7 percent per year. They beat Sweden.
p330
aVI run Sweden the same 16 year period.
p331
aa(lp332
VSecond round, it's Sweden, 1916,
p333
aVagainst Egypt, 1990.
p334
aVHere we go. Once again the USA is part of the reason here.
p335
aVThey get safe water, they get food for the poor,
p336
aVand they get malaria eradicated.
p337
aV5.5 percent. They are faster than the millennium development goal.
p338
aa(lp339
VAnd third chance for Sweden, against Brazil here.
p340
aVBrazil here has amazing social improvement
p341
aVover the last 16 years,
p342
aVand they go faster than Sweden.
p343
aVThis means that the world is converging.
p344
aVThe middle income countries,
p345
aVthe emerging economy, they are catching up.
p346
aVThey are moving to cities,
p347
aVwhere they also get better assistance for that.
p348
aa(lp349
VWell the Swedish students protest at this point.
p350
aVThey say, "This is not fair,
p351
aVbecause these countries had vaccines and antibiotics
p352
aVthat were not available for Sweden.
p353
aVWe have to do real-time competition."
p354
aVOkay. I give you Singapore, the year I was born.
p355
aVSingapore had twice the child mortality of Sweden.
p356
aVIt's the most tropical country in the world,
p357
aVa marshland on the equator.
p358
aVAnd here we go. It took a little time for them to get independent.
p359
aVBut then they started to grow their economy.
p360
aVAnd they made the social investment. They got away malaria.
p361
aVThey got a magnificent health system
p362
aVthat beat both the U.S. and Sweden.
p363
aVWe never thought it would happen that they would win over Sweden!
p364
aV(Applause)
p365
aa(lp366
VAll these green countries are achieving millennium development goals.
p367
aVThese yellow are just about to be doing this.
p368
aVThese red are the countries that doesn't do it, and the policy has to be improved.
p369
aVNot simplistic extrapolation.
p370
aVWe have to really find a way
p371
aVof supporting those countries in a better way.
p372
aVWe have to respect the middle income countries
p373
aVon what they are doing.
p374
aVAnd we have to fact-base the whole way we look at the world.
p375
aa(lp376
VThis is dollar per person. This is HIV in the countries.
p377
aVThe blue is Africa.
p378
aVThe size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected.
p379
aVYou see the tragedy in South Africa there.
p380
aVAbout 20 percent of the adult population are infected.
p381
aVAnd in spite of them having quite a high income,
p382
aVthey have a huge number of HIV infected.
p383
aVBut you also see that there are African countries down here.
p384
aVThere is no such thing as an HIV epidemic in Africa.
p385
aVThere's a number, five to 10 countries in Africa
p386
aVthat has the same level as Sweden and United States.
p387
aVAnd there are others who are extremely high.
p388
aa(lp389
VAnd I will show you that what has happened
p390
aVin one of the best countries, with the most vibrant economy
p391
aVin Africa and a good governance, Botswana.
p392
aVThey have a very high level. It's coming down.
p393
aVBut now it's not falling,
p394
aVbecause there, with help from PEPFAR,
p395
aVit's working with treatment. And people are not dying.
p396
aVAnd you can see it's not that easy,
p397
aVthat it is war which caused this.
p398
aVBecause here, in Congo, there is war.
p399
aVAnd here, in Zambia, there is peace.
p400
aa(lp401
VAnd it's not the economy. Richer country has a little higher.
p402
aVIf I split Tanzania in its income,
p403
aVthe richer 20 percent in Tanzania
p404
aVhas more HIV than the poorest one.
p405
aVAnd it's really different within each country.
p406
aVLook at the provinces of Kenya. They are very different.
p407
aVAnd this is the situation you see.
p408
aVIt's not deep poverty. It's the special situation,
p409
aVprobably of concurrent sexual partnership
p410
aVamong part of the heterosexual population
p411
aVin some countries, or some parts of countries,
p412
aVin south and eastern Africa.
p413
aa(lp414
VDon't make it Africa. Don't make it a race issue.
p415
aVMake it a local issue. And do prevention at each place,
p416
aVin the way it can be done there.
p417
aVSo to just end up,
p418
aVthere are things of suffering
p419
aVin the one billion poorest, which we don't know.
p420
aVThose who live beyond the cellphone,
p421
aVthose who have yet to see a computer,
p422
aVthose who have no electricity at home.
p423
aa(lp424
VThis is the disease, Konzo, I spent 20 years
p425
aVelucidating in Africa.
p426
aVIt's caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation.
p427
aVIt's similar to the pellagra epidemic in Mississippi in the '30s.
p428
aVIt's similar to other nutritional diseases.
p429
aVIt will never affect a rich person.
p430
aa(lp431
VWe have seen it here in Mozambique.
p432
aVThis is the epidemic in Mozambique. This is an epidemic in northern Tanzania.
p433
aVYou never heard about the disease.
p434
aVBut it's much more than Ebola
p435
aVthat has been affected by this disease.
p436
aVCause crippling throughout the world.
p437
aVAnd over the last two years,
p438
aV2,000 people has been crippled
p439
aVin the southern tip of Bandundu region.
p440
aVThat used to be the illegal diamond trade,
p441
aVfrom the UNITA-dominated area in Angola.
p442
aVThat has now disappeared,
p443
aVand they are now in great economic problem.
p444
aVAnd one week ago, for the first time,
p445
aVthere were four lines on the Internet.
p446
aa(lp447
VDon't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies
p448
aVand the great capacity
p449
aVof people in the middle income countries
