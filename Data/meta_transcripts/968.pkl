VSo I want to tell you a story \u2014 an encouraging story \u2014
p4
aVabout addressing
p5
aVdesperation, depression and despair in Afghanistan,
p6
aVand what we have learned from it,
p7
aVand how to help people
p8
aVto overcome traumatic experiences
p9
aVand how to help them to regain some confidence
p10
aVin the time ahead \u2014 in the future \u2014
p11
aVand how to participate again in everyday life.
p12
aVSo, I am a Jungian psychoanalyst,
p13
aVand I went to Afghanistan in January 2004, by chance,
p14
aVon an assignment for Medica Mondiale.
p15
aVJung in Afghanistan \u2014
p16
aVyou get the picture.
p17
aVAfghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world,
p18
aVand 70 percent of the people are illiterate.
p19
aVWar and malnutrition kills people
p20
aVtogether with hope.
p21
aVYou may know this from the media,
p22
aVbut what you may not know
p23
aVis that the average age of the Afghan people is 17 years old,
p24
aVwhich means they grow up in such an environment
p25
aVand \u2014 I repeat myself \u2014
p26
aVin 30 years of war.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo this translates
p29
aVinto ongoing violence,
p30
aVforeign interests, bribery,
p31
aVdrugs, ethnic conflicts,
p32
aVbad health, shame, fear
p33
aVand cumulative traumatic experiences.
p34
aVLocal and foreign military
p35
aVare supposed to build peace together with the donors
p36
aVand the governmental and non-governmental organizations.
p37
aVAnd people had hope, yes,
p38
aVbut until they realized
p39
aVtheir situation worsens every day \u2014
p40
aVeither because they are being killed
p41
aVor because, somehow,
p42
aVthey are poorer than eight years ago.
p43
aVOne figure for that:
p44
aV54 percent of the children under the age of five years
p45
aVsuffer from malnutrition.
p46
aa(lp47
VYet, there is hope.
p48
aVOne day a man told me,
p49
aV"My future does not look brilliant,
p50
aVbut I want to have a brilliant future for my son."
p51
aVThis is a picture I took in 2005,
p52
aVwalking on Fridays over the hills in Kabul,
p53
aVand for me it's a symbolic picture
p54
aVof an open future for a young generation.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo, doctors prescribe medication.
p57
aVAnd donors
p58
aVare supposed to bring peace
p59
aVby building schools and roads.
p60
aVMilitary collect weapons,
p61
aVand depression stays intact.
p62
aVWhy?
p63
aVBecause people don't have tools
p64
aVto cope with it, to get over it.
p65
aVSo, soon after my arrival,
p66
aVI had confirmed something which I had already known;
p67
aVthat my instruments come from the heart of modern Europe, yes.
p68
aVHowever, what can wound us
p69
aVand our reaction to those wounds \u2014
p70
aVthey are universal.
p71
aVAnd the big challenge
p72
aVwas how to understand the meaning of the symptom
p73
aVin this specific cultural context.
p74
aVAfter a counseling session, a woman said to me,
p75
aV"Because you have felt me, I can feel myself again,
p76
aVand I want to participate again
p77
aVin my family life."
p78
aVThis was very important,
p79
aVbecause the family is central
p80
aVin Afghans' social system.
p81
aa(lp82
VNo one can survive alone.
p83
aVAnd if people feel used, worthless and ashamed,
p84
aVbecause something horrible has happened to them,
p85
aVthen they retreat, and they fall into social isolation,
p86
aVand they do not dare to tell this evil
p87
aVto other people or to their loved ones,
p88
aVbecause they do not want to burden them.
p89
aVAnd very often violence is a way to cope with it.
p90
aVTraumatized people also easily lose control \u2014
p91
aVsymptoms are hyper-arousal and memory flashbacks \u2014
p92
aVso people are in a constant fear
p93
aVthat those horrible feelings of that traumatic event
p94
aVmight come back unexpectedly,
p95
aVsuddenly,
p96
aVand they cannot control it.
p97
aVTo compensate this loss of inner control,
p98
aVthey try to control the outside,
p99
aVvery understandably \u2014 mostly the family \u2014
p100
aVand unfortunately,
p101
aVthis fits very well
p102
aVinto the traditional side,
p103
aVregressive side, repressive side,
p104
aVrestrictive side of the cultural context.
p105
aVSo, husbands start beating wives,
p106
aVmothers and fathers beat their children,
p107
aVand afterward, they feel awful.
p108
aVThey did not want to do this, it just happened \u2014
p109
aVthey lost control.
p110
aVThe desperate try
p111
aVto restore order and normality,
p112
aVand if we are not able to cut this circle of violence,
p113
aVit will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt.
p114
aVAnd partly this is already happening.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo everybody needs a sense for the future,
p117
aVand the Afghan sense of the future
p118
aVis shattered.
p119
aVBut let me repeat the words of the woman.
p120
aV"Because you have felt me,
p121
aVI can feel myself again."
p122
aVSo the key here is empathy.
p123
aVSomebody has to be a witness
p124
aVto what has happened to you.
p125
aVSomebody has to feel how you felt.
p126
aVAnd somebody has to see you and listen to you.
p127
aVEverybody must be able
p128
aVto know what he or she has experienced is true,
p129
aVand this only goes with another person.
p130
aVSo everybody must be able to say,
p131
aV"This happened to me, and it did this with me,
p132
aVbut I'm able to live with it, to cope with it,
p133
aVand to learn from it.
p134
aVAnd I want to engage myself
p135
aVin the bright future for my children
p136
aVand the children of my children,
p137
aVand I will not marry-off my 13 year-old daughter," \u2014
p138
aVwhat happens too often in Afghanistan.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo something can be done,
p141
aVeven in such extreme environments as Afghanistan.
p142
aVAnd I started thinking about a counseling program.
p143
aVBut, of course, I needed help and funds.
p144
aVAnd one evening,
p145
aVI was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in Kabul,
p146
aVand he asked what I thought would be good in Afghanistan.
p147
aVAnd I explained to him quickly,
p148
aVI would train psycho-social counselors,
p149
aVI would open centers, and I explained to him why.
p150
aVThis man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening
p151
aVand said, "If you want to do this, call me."
p152
aVAt that time, it was the head of Caritas Germany.
p153
aa(lp154
VSo, I was able to launch a three-year project with Caritas Germany,
p155
aVand we trained 30 Afghan women and men,
p156
aVand we opened 15 counseling centers in Kabul.
p157
aVThis was our sign \u2014 it's hand-painted,
p158
aVand we had 45 all over Kabul.
p159
aVEleven thousand people came \u2014 more than that.
p160
aVAnd 70 percent regained their lives.
p161
aVThis was a very exciting time,
p162
aVdeveloping this with my wonderful Afghan team.
p163
aVAnd they are working with me up to today.
p164
aVWe developed a culturally-sensitive
p165
aVpsycho-social counseling approach.
p166
aVSo, from 2008 up until today,
p167
aVa substantial change and step forward
p168
aVhas been taking place.
p169
aa(lp170
VThe European Union delegation in Kabul
p171
aVcame into this and hired me to work
p172
aVinside the Ministry of Public Health,
p173
aVto lobby this approach \u2014
p174
aVwe succeeded.
p175
aVWe revised the mental health component
p176
aVof the primary health care services
p177
aVby adding psycho-social care
p178
aVand psycho-social counselors to the system.
p179
aVThis means, certainly, to retrain all health staff.
p180
aVBut for that, we already have the training manuals,
p181
aVwhich are approved by the Ministry
p182
aVand moreover, this approach is now part
p183
aVof the mental health strategy in Afghanistan.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo we also have implemented it already
p186
aVin some selected clinics in three provinces,
p187
aVand you are the first to see the results.
p188
aVWe wanted to know if what is being done is effective.
p189
aVAnd here you can see
p190
aVthe patients all had symptoms of depression,
p191
aVmoderate and severe.
p192
aVAnd the red line is the treatment as usual \u2014
p193
aVmedication with a medical doctor.
p194
aVAnd all the symptoms
p195
aVstayed the same or even got worse.
p196
aVAnd the green line is treatment with psycho-social counseling only,
p197
aVwithout medication.
p198
aVAnd you can see the symptoms almost completely go away,
p199
aVand the psycho-social stress has dropped significantly,
p200
aVwhich is explicable,
p201
aVbecause you cannot take away the psycho-social stresses,
p202
aVbut you can learn how to cope with them.
p203
aVSo this makes us very happy,
p204
aVbecause now we also have some evidence
p205
aVthat this is working.
p206
aa(lp207
VSo here you see,
p208
aVthis is a health facility in Northern Afghanistan,
p209
aVand every morning it looks like this all over.
p210
aVAnd doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients,
p211
aVbut now this will change.
p212
aVThey go to the clinics,
p213
aVbecause they want to cure their immediate symptoms,
p214
aVand they will find somebody to talk to
p215
aVand discuss these issues
p216
aVand talk about what is burdening them
p217
aVand find solutions, develop their resources,
p218
aVlearn tools to solve their family conflicts
p219
aVand gain some confidence in the future.
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd I would like to share one short vignette.
p222
aVOne Hazara said to his Pashtun counselor,
p223
aV"If we were to have met some years ago,
p224
aVthen we would have killed each other.
p225
aVAnd now you are helping me
p226
aVto regain some confidence in the future."
p227
aVAnd another counselor said to me after the training,
p228
aV"You know, I never knew why I survived the killings in my village,
p229
aVbut now I know,
p230
aVbecause I am part of a nucleus
p231
aVof a new peaceful society in Afghanistan."
p232
aVSo I believe this kept me running.
p233
aVAnd this is a really emancipatory and political contribution
p234
aVto peace and reconciliation.
p235
aVAnd also \u2014 I think \u2014
p236
aVwithout psycho-social therapy,
p237
aVand without considering this
p238
aVin all humanitarian projects,
p239
aVwe cannot build-up civil societies.
p240
aa(lp241
VI thought it was an idea worth spreading,
p242
aVand I think it must be,
p243
aVcan be, could be replicated elsewhere.
p244
aa(lp245
VI thank you for your attention.
