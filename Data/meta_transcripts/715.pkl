VActually, I come from Britain,
p4
aVbut I've been living in Maldives for 26 years now.
p5
aVSo, that's home really.
p6
aVThe Maldives, as I'm sure you're aware, are a chain of islands
p7
aVoff the southwest coast of India here.
p8
aVCapital, Malé, where I live.
p9
aVActually, sitting here today in Mysore,
p10
aVwe're closer to Malé than we are to Delhi, for example.
p11
aa(lp12
VIf you're in IT, India, obviously, is the place to be at the moment.
p13
aVBut if you're a marine biologist, Maldives is not such a bad place to be.
p14
aVAnd it has been my home these years.
p15
aVFor those of you who've been there, fantastic coral reefs,
p16
aVfantastic diving, fantastic snorkeling.
p17
aVI spend as much of my time as possible
p18
aVinvestigating the marine life.
p19
aVI study fish,
p20
aValso the bigger things, whales and dolphins.
p21
aa(lp22
VThis is a blue whale. We have blue whales
p23
aVin the waters around here, off Maldives,
p24
aVaround the waters of India. You can see them off Kerala.
p25
aVAnd, in fact, we're very lucky in this region.
p26
aVOne of the best places in the world to see blue whales
p27
aVis here in this region.
p28
aVIn Sri Lanka, if you go down to the south coast of Sri Lanka,
p29
aVduring the northeast monsoon season,
p30
aVyou can see blue whales very, very easily.
p31
aVIt's probably the best place in the world to see them.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, when I talk about the northeast monsoon season,
p34
aVI'm sure many of you here know exactly what I mean,
p35
aVbut perhaps some of you are not quite so sure.
p36
aVI need to explain a little bit about monsoons.
p37
aVNow, monsoon, the root of the word "monsoon"
p38
aVcomes from the word "season."
p39
aa(lp40
VSo, it's just a season. And there are two seasons in most of South Asia.
p41
aVAnd in the summer India heats up, gets very hot.
p42
aVHot air rises, and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it.
p43
aVAnd the way it works is, it comes from the southwest.
p44
aVIt comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India.
p45
aVSo it comes from the southwest. It's a southwest monsoon.
p46
aVPicks up moisture as it crosses the ocean.
p47
aVThat's what brings the monsoon rain.
p48
aVAnd then in the winter things cool down.
p49
aVHigh pressure builds over India.
p50
aVAnd the whole system goes into reverse.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo, the wind is now coming from the northeast
p53
aVout of India, across the Indian Ocean,
p54
aVthis way towards Africa.
p55
aVKeep that in mind.
p56
aVNow, I'm a marine biologist, but I'm actually
p57
aVa bit of an old fashioned naturalist, I suppose.
p58
aVI'm interested in all sorts of things, almost everything that moves,
p59
aVincluding dragonflies. And I'm actually
p60
aVgoing to talk, this afternoon, about dragonflies.
p61
aVThis is a very beautiful species, it's called the Oriental Scarlet.
p62
aa(lp63
VAnd one thing you need to know about dragonflies,
p64
aVone important thing,
p65
aVis that they lay their eggs in fresh water.
p66
aVThey need fresh water to breed.
p67
aVThey lay the eggs into fresh water.
p68
aVLittle larvae hatch out in fresh water.
p69
aVThey feed on other little things. They feed on mosquito larvae.
p70
aVSo, they're very important.
p71
aVThey control mosquito larvae, among other things.
p72
aVAnd they grow and grow by stages. And they climb out
p73
aVof the water, burst out, as the adult which we see.
p74
aVAnd typically, there is a lot of variation,
p75
aVbut if you have a dragonfly with, say, a one year life cycle,
p76
aVwhich is quite typical, the larva, living in the fresh water,
p77
aVlives for 10 or 11 months.
p78
aVAnd then the adult, which comes after, lives for one or two months.
p79
aVSo it's essentially a freshwater animal.
p80
aVIt really does need fresh water.
p81
aa(lp82
VNow, the particular species of dragonfly
p83
aVI want to talk about is this one,
p84
aVbecause most dragonflies, like the one we've just seen,
p85
aVwhen the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life,
p86
aVit doesn't go very far. It can't travel very far.
p87
aVA few kilometers, maybe, is quite typical.
p88
aVThey are very good fliers, but they don't go too far.
p89
aVBut this guy is an exception.
p90
aVAnd this is called the Globe Skimmer,
p91
aVor Wandering Glider.
p92
aVAnd, as the name might suggest, it is found pretty much around the world.
p93
aVIt lives throughout the tropics, the Americas,
p94
aVAfrica, Asia, Australia, into the Pacific.
p95
aVAnd it wanders far and wide. We know that much about it.
p96
aVBut it really hasn't been studied very much.
p97
aa(lp98
VIt's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly.
p99
aVIf you're going to study dragonflies, you want to study those really bright beautiful ones,
p100
aVlike that red one. Or the really rare ones, the endemic endangered ones.
p101
aVThis is, it seems a bit dull you know.
p102
aVIt's sort of dull-colored. And it's fairly common.
p103
aVAnd it occurs everywhere \u2014 you know, why bother?
p104
aVBut if you take that attitude, you're actually missing something rather special.
p105
aVBecause this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell.
p106
aVAnd I feel very privileged to have stumbled across it
p107
aVliving in the Maldives.
p108
aa(lp109
VWhen I first went to the Maldives,
p110
aVdead keen on diving, spent as much of my time
p111
aVas I could in and under the water.
p112
aVDidn't notice any dragonflies; maybe they were there, maybe they weren't.
p113
aVDidn't notice them.
p114
aVBut after some time, after some months, one day
p115
aVas I was going out and about,
p116
aVsuddenly I noticed hundreds of dragonflies, hundreds of dragonflies.
p117
aVSomething like this, these are all this species Globe Skimmer.
p118
aVI didn't know at the time, but I know now,
p119
aVthey're Globe Skimmers, hundreds of them.
p120
aVAnd they were there for some time. And then they were gone.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd I didn't think anything more of it until
p123
aVthe following year, when it happened again,
p124
aVand then the year after that, and then the year after that.
p125
aVAnd I was a bit slow, I didn't really take too much notice.
p126
aVBut I asked some Maldivian friends and colleagues, and yes they come every year.
p127
aVAnd I asked people about them and yes,
p128
aVthey knew, but they didn't know anything,
p129
aVwhere they came from, or anything.
p130
aVAnd again I didn't think too much of it.
p131
aVBut slowly it began to dawn on me that something
p132
aVrather special was happening.
p133
aa(lp134
VBecause dragonflies need fresh water to breed.
p135
aVAnd the Maldives, and I'm sure some of you have been there \u2014
p136
aVso here is home.
p137
aVSo, Maldives, beautiful place.
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aVIt's built entirely of coral reefs.
p140
aVAnd on top of the coral reefs are sand banks.
p141
aVAverage height, about that much above sea level.
p142
aVSo, global warming, sea level rise, it's a real serious issue.
p143
aVBut I'm not going to talk about that.
p144
aVAnother important point of these sand banks
p145
aVis that when it rains,
p146
aVthe rainwater soaks down into the soil. So, it's gone.
p147
aVSo, it stays under the soil.
p148
aVThe trees can put their roots into it.
p149
aVHumans can dig holes and make a well.
p150
aa(lp151
VBut dragonflies \u2014 a bit tricky.
p152
aVThere is no surface fresh water.
p153
aVThere are no ponds, streams, rivers, lakes,
p154
aVnothing like that.
p155
aVSo, why is it that every year
p156
aVmillions of dragonflies, millions,
p157
aVmillions of dragonflies turn up?
p158
aVI got a little bit curious. In fact I'll stop here,
p159
aVbecause I want to ask, and there is a lot of people who,
p160
aVfrom India of course, people who grew up spending your childhood here.
p161
aVThose of you who are Indian or spent your childhood here,
p162
aVlet me have a show of hands, who of you \u2014
p163
aVnot yet, not yet!
p164
aVYou're too keen. You're too keen. No. Hang on. Hang on.
p165
aVWait for the go. I'll say go.
p166
aa(lp167
VThose of you who grew up in India,
p168
aVdo you remember in your childhood, dragonflies,
p169
aVswarms of dragonflies? Maybe at school,
p170
aVmaybe tying little bits of string onto them?
p171
aVMaybe pulling bits off? I'm not asking about that.
p172
aVYou've only got to say, do you remember seeing lots of dragonflies.
p173
aVAny hands? Any hands? Yes. Thank you. Thank you.
p174
aVIt's a widespread phenomenon
p175
aVthroughout South Asia, including the Maldives.
p176
aVAnd I got a bit curious about it.
p177
aa(lp178
VIn the Maldives \u2014 now, in India there is plenty of water,
p179
aVso, dragonflies, yeah, of course. Why not?
p180
aVBut in Maldives, no fresh water. So, what on Earth is going on?
p181
aVAnd the first thing I did was started recording
p182
aVwhen they turned up in the Maldives.
p183
aVAnd there is the answer, 21st of October.
p184
aVNot every year, that's the average date.
p185
aVSo, I've been writing it down for 15 years now.
p186
aVYou'd think they're coming from India. It's the closest place.
p187
aVBut in October, remember, we're still in southwest monsoon,
p188
aVMaldives is still in the southwest monsoon.
p189
aVBut wind is, invariably, every time, is from the west.
p190
aVIt's going towards India, not from India.
p191
aVSo, are these things, how are these things getting here?
p192
aVAre they coming from India against the wind?
p193
aVSeemed a bit unlikely.
p194
aa(lp195
VSo, next thing I did is I got on the phone.
p196
aVMaldives is a long archipelago.
p197
aVIt stretches about 500 miles, of course it's India here.
p198
aVI got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues.
p199
aVWhen do you see the dragonflies appear?
p200
aVAnd pretty soon, a picture started emerging.
p201
aVIn Bangalore, a colleague there sent me
p202
aVinformation for three years, average,
p203
aV24th of September, so late September.
p204
aVDown in Trivandrum, a bit later.
p205
aVFar north of Maldives, a bit later.
p206
aVThen Malé, then further south.
p207
aVAnd then the southernmost Maldives.
p208
aVIt's pretty obvious, they're coming from India.
p209
aVBut they are coming 400 miles across the ocean, against the wind.
p210
aVHow on Earth are they doing that?
p211
aVI didn't know.
p212
aa(lp213
VThe next thing I did was I started counting dragonflies.
p214
aVI wanted to know about their seasonality,
p215
aVwhat time of year, this is when they first arrive,
p216
aVbut how long are they around for? Does that give any clues?
p217
aVSo, I started a very rigorous scientific process.
p218
aVI had a rigorous scientific transect.
p219
aVI got on my bicycle,
p220
aVand I cycled around the island of Malé.
p221
aVIt's about five kilometers around,
p222
aVcounting the dragonflies as I go,
p223
aVtrying not to bump into people as I'm looking in the trees.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd they're here for a very short time,
p226
aVOctober, November, December. That's it.
p227
aVAnd then they tail off, there's a few, but that's it.
p228
aVOctober, November, December. That is not the northeast monsoon season.
p229
aVThat's not the southwest season.
p230
aVThat's the inter-monsoon,
p231
aVthe time when the monsoon changes.
p232
aa(lp233
VNow, what I said was, you get the southwest monsoon going one way,
p234
aVand then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way.
p235
aVAnd that sort of gives the impression you've got one air mass
p236
aVgoing up and down, up and down. It doesn't work like that.
p237
aVWhat happens, actually, is there is two air masses.
p238
aVAnd there is a front between them, and the front moves.
p239
aVSo, if you've got India here,
p240
aVwhen the front is up above India you're into the southwest monsoon.
p241
aVThen the front moves into the northeast monsoon.
p242
aVAnd that front in the middle is not vertical,
p243
aVit's at an angle.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo, as it comes over towards Malé
p246
aVI'm standing in Malé underneath the front.
p247
aVI can be in the southwest monsoon.
p248
aVBut the wind above is from the northeast monsoon.
p249
aVSo, the dragonflies are actually coming from India on the northeast monsoon,
p250
aVbut at an altitude at 1,000 to 2,000 meters up in the air. Incredible.
p251
aVThese little insects, it's the same ones we see out here [in India],
p252
aVtwo inches long, five centimeters long,
p253
aVflying in their millions, 400 miles across the ocean,
p254
aVat 2,000 meters up. Quite incredible.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo, I was quite pleased with myself. I thought wow, I've tracked this one,
p257
aVI know how they come here. Then I scratched my head a bit,
p258
aVand that's okay,
p259
aVI know how they come here, but why do they come here?
p260
aVWhat are millions of dragonflies doing, flying out over the ocean every year
p261
aVto their apparent doom?
p262
aVIt doesn't make sense. There is nothing for them in Maldives.
p263
aVWhat on Earth are they doing?
p264
aVWell, to cut a long story short,
p265
aVthey're actually flying right across the ocean.
p266
aVThey're making it all the way across to East Africa.
p267
aa(lp268
VI know that because I have friends who work on fisheries' research vessels
p269
aVwho have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean.
p270
aVI know because we have reports from Seychelles,
p271
aVwhich fit in as well, down here.
p272
aVAnd I know because
p273
aVwhen you look at the rainfall,
p274
aVthese particular insects, these Globe Skimmers
p275
aVbreed in temporary rain water pools.
p276
aVOkay, they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are,
p277
aVthe monsoon rains.
p278
aVThe larvae have to develop very quickly.
p279
aVThey only take six weeks. Instead of 11 months, they're six weeks.
p280
aVThey're up, and they're off.
p281
aa(lp282
VNow, here we have, in case you can't read at the back,
p283
aVthe top is rainfall for India.
p284
aVAnd we're starting in June. So this is the monsoon rain.
p285
aVBy September, October, it's drying out.
p286
aVNothing for these dragonflies. There is no more seasonal rain.
p287
aVThey've got to go hunting for seasonal rain.
p288
aVAnd they fly south. As the monsoon withdraws to the south
p289
aVthey come down through Karnataka, into Kerala.
p290
aVAnd then they run out of land.
p291
aVBut they are incredibly good fliers. This particular species,
p292
aVit can fly for thousands of kilometers.
p293
aVAnd it just keeps going. And the wind, the northeast wind
p294
aVswooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to Africa,
p295
aVwhere it's raining.
p296
aVAnd they are breeding in the rains of Africa.
p297
aVNow, this is southeast Africa. It makes it look like there are sort of
p298
aVtwo breeding periods here. It's slightly more complicated than that.
p299
aa(lp300
VWhat's happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here.
p301
aVAnd the dragonflies you can see today
p302
aVoutside here, on the campus,
p303
aVare the young of this generation.
p304
aVThey hatched out in India.
p305
aVThey're looking for somewhere to breed. If it rains here they'll breed.
p306
aVBut most of them are going to carry on. And next stop,
p307
aVperhaps only four or five days away is going to be East Africa.
p308
aVThe wind will swoosh them out across here.
p309
aVIf they pass the Maldives they might go and have a look,
p310
aVnothing there, they'll carry on.
p311
aa(lp312
VHere, here, Kenya, East Africa,
p313
aVthey've actually just come out of a long drought.
p314
aVJust last week the rains broke. The short rains broke
p315
aVand it's raining there now.
p316
aVAnd the dragonflies are there. I have reports from my various contacts.
p317
aVThe dragonflies are here now. They're breeding there.
p318
aVWhen those guys, they'll lay their eggs now.
p319
aVThey'll hatch out in six weeks. By that time
p320
aVthe seasonal rains have moved on. It's not there, it's down here.
p321
aVThey'll fly down here. And the clever thing is
p322
aVthe wind is always converging to where the rain is.
p323
aVThe rain occurs, these are summer rains.
p324
aVThis is a summer monsoon.
p325
aVThe sun is overhead there. Summer rains in southern Africa.
p326
aVThe sun is overhead, maximum heating,
p327
aVmaximum evaporation, maximum clouds,
p328
aVmaximum rainfall,
p329
aVmaximum opportunities for reproduction.
p330
aa(lp331
VNot only that, because you have this convection,
p332
aVyou have this rising of the air
p333
aVwhere it's hot, air is drawn in.
p334
aVThere's a convergence. So, wherever the rain is falling,
p335
aVthe air is drawn towards it to replace the air that's rising.
p336
aVSo, the little fellow that hatches out here,
p337
aVhe gets up into the air, he is automatically carried
p338
aVto where the rain is falling.
p339
aVLay their eggs, next generation, they come up,
p340
aVautomatically carried to where the rain is falling.
p341
aVIt's now back there. They come out, it's time to come back.
p342
aVSo, in four generations, one, two, three,
p343
aVfour and then back.
p344
aa(lp345
VA complete circuit of the Indian Ocean.
p346
aVThis is a circuit of about 16,000 kilometers.
p347
aV16,000 kilometers, four generations, mind you,
p348
aVfor a two inch long insect. It's quite incredible.
p349
aVThose of you from North America
p350
aVwill be familiar with the Monarch butterfly.
p351
aVWhich, up until now has had the longest known insect migration.
p352
aVIt's only half the length of this one.
p353
aVAnd this crossing here, of the ocean,
p354
aVis the only truly regular transoceanic crossing
p355
aVof any insect.
p356
aVA quite incredible feat.
p357
aVAnd I only stumbled on this because I was living in Malé,
p358
aVin Maldives for long enough
p359
aVfor it to percolate into my brain
p360
aVthat something rather special was going on.
p361
aa(lp362
VBut dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing.
p363
aVThere is more to the story.
p364
aVI'm also interested in birds. And I'm familiar
p365
aVwith this fellow. This is a rather special bird.
p366
aVIt's a falcon. It's called the eastern red-footed falcon, obviously.
p367
aVBut it's also called the Amur Falcon.
p368
aVAnd it's called the Amur Falcon
p369
aVbecause it breeds in Amurland.
p370
aVWhich is an area along the Amur River, which is up here.
p371
aVIt's the border, much of it is the border
p372
aVbetween China and Russia, up here in the far east.
p373
aa(lp374
VSo, Siberia, Manchuria.
p375
aVAnd that's where it breeds.
p376
aVAnd if you're a falcon it's quite a nice place to be in the summer.
p377
aVBut it's a pretty miserable place to be in the winter.
p378
aVIt's, well, you can imagine.
p379
aVSo, as any sensible bird would do,
p380
aVhe moves south. They move south. The whole population moves south.
p381
aVBut then the being sensible stopped.
p382
aVSo, now they don't stop here, or even down here.
p383
aVNo, they turn across here.
p384
aVThey have a little refueling stop in northeastern India.
p385
aVThey come to the latitude of about Mumbai or Goa.
p386
aVAnd then they strike out across the ocean, down to Kenya.
p387
aVAnd down here, and they winter down here [in southern Africa].
p388
aVIncredible. This is the most extraordinary migration
p389
aVof any bird of prey. A quite incredible migration.
p390
aa(lp391
VAnd they are not the only one that makes the crossing.
p392
aVThey have the most incredible journey, but several make the crossing from India
p393
aVto Africa. Includes this one, the hobby.
p394
aVThis fellow is a very nice bird, this is the Pied cuckoo.
p395
aVThose of you from northern India will be familiar with this.
p396
aVIt comes with the monsoons.
p397
aVThis time of year they cross back to Africa.
p398
aVAnd this guy, the roller, a rather beautiful bird.
p399
aVIt's known as the Eurasian Roller. In India it occurs in the northwest,
p400
aVso it's known as the Kashmir Roller.
p401
aVAnd these birds, what I've done is I've complied all the records,
p402
aVall the available records of these birds,
p403
aVput them together, and found out they migrate at exactly the same time
p404
aVas the dragonflies.
p405
aVThey make use of exactly the same winds.
p406
aVThey travel at exactly the same time with the same winds
p407
aVto make the crossing. I know they travel at the same altitude.
p408
aa(lp409
VIt's known about the Amur Falcon. This guy, unfortunately,
p410
aVone of these met an unfortunate end.
p411
aVHe was flying off the coast of Goa,
p412
aV21 years ago, 1988. October, 1988.
p413
aVAn Indian Navy jet was flying off Goa,
p414
aVbang! In the middle of the night. Fortunately, a two engine jet
p415
aVgot back to base, and they pulled the remains of one of these [Eurasian Rollers] out.
