VImagine you're walking through a forest.
p4
aVI'm guessing you're thinking of a collection of trees,
p5
aVwhat we foresters call a stand,
p6
aVwith their rugged stems and their beautiful crowns.
p7
aVYes, trees are the foundation of forests,
p8
aVbut a forest is much more than what you see,
p9
aVand today I want to change the way you think about forests.
p10
aVYou see, underground there is this other world,
p11
aVa world of infinite biological pathways
p12
aVthat connect trees and allow them to communicate
p13
aVand allow the forest to behave as though it's a single organism.
p14
aVIt might remind you of a sort of intelligence.
p15
aa(lp16
VHow do I know this?
p17
aVHere's my story.
p18
aVI grew up in the forests of British Columbia.
p19
aVI used to lay on the forest floor and stare up at the tree crowns.
p20
aVThey were giants.
p21
aVMy grandfather was a giant, too.
p22
aVHe was a horse logger,
p23
aVand he used to selectively cut cedar poles from the inland rainforest.
p24
aVGrandpa taught me about the quiet and cohesive ways of the woods,
p25
aVand how my family was knit into it.
p26
aVSo I followed in grandpa's footsteps.
p27
aa(lp28
VHe and I had this curiosity about forests,
p29
aVand my first big "aha" moment
p30
aVwas at the outhouse by our lake.
p31
aVOur poor dog Jigs had slipped and fallen into the pit.
p32
aVSo grandpa ran up with his shovel to rescue the poor dog.
p33
aVHe was down there, swimming in the muck.
p34
aVBut as grandpa dug through that forest floor,
p35
aVI became fascinated with the roots,
p36
aVand under that, what I learned later was the white mycelium
p37
aVand under that the red and yellow mineral horizons.
p38
aVEventually, grandpa and I rescued the poor dog,
p39
aVbut it was at that moment that I realized
p40
aVthat that palette of roots and soil
p41
aVwas really the foundation of the forest.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd I wanted to know more.
p44
aVSo I studied forestry.
p45
aVBut soon I found myself working alongside the powerful people
p46
aVin charge of the commercial harvest.
p47
aVThe extent of the clear-cutting
p48
aVwas alarming,
p49
aVand I soon found myself conflicted by my part in it.
p50
aVNot only that, the spraying and hacking of the aspens and birches
p51
aVto make way for the more commercially valuable planted pines and firs
p52
aVwas astounding.
p53
aVIt seemed that nothing could stop this relentless industrial machine.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo I went back to school,
p56
aVand I studied my other world.
p57
aVYou see, scientists had just discovered in the laboratory in vitro
p58
aVthat one pine seedling root
p59
aVcould transmit carbon to another pine seedling root.
p60
aVBut this was in the laboratory,
p61
aVand I wondered, could this happen in real forests?
p62
aVI thought yes.
p63
aVTrees in real forests might also share information below ground.
p64
aVBut this was really controversial,
p65
aVand some people thought I was crazy,
p66
aVand I had a really hard time getting research funding.
p67
aVBut I persevered,
p68
aVand I eventually conducted some experiments deep in the forest,
p69
aV25 years ago.
p70
aVI grew 80 replicates of three species:
p71
aVpaper birch, Douglas fir, and western red cedar.
p72
aVI figured the birch and the fir would be connected in a belowground web,
p73
aVbut not the cedar.
p74
aVIt was in its own other world.
p75
aVAnd I gathered my apparatus,
p76
aVand I had no money, so I had to do it on the cheap.
p77
aVSo I went to Canadian Tire \u2014
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
Vand I bought some plastic bags and duct tape and shade cloth,
p82
aVa timer, a paper suit, a respirator.
p83
aVAnd then I borrowed some high-tech stuff from my university:
p84
aVa Geiger counter, a scintillation counter, a mass spectrometer, microscopes.
p85
aVAnd then I got some really dangerous stuff:
p86
aVsyringes full of radioactive carbon-14 carbon dioxide gas
p87
aVand some high pressure bottles
p88
aVof the stable isotope carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.
p89
aVBut I was legally permitted.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VOh, and I forgot some stuff,
p94
aVimportant stuff: the bug spray,
p95
aVthe bear spray, the filters for my respirator.
p96
aVOh well.
p97
aa(lp98
VThe first day of the experiment, we got out to our plot
p99
aVand a grizzly bear and her cub chased us off.
p100
aVAnd I had no bear spray.
p101
aVBut you know, this is how forest research in Canada goes.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VSo I came back the next day,
p106
aVand mama grizzly and her cub were gone.
p107
aVSo this time, we really got started,
p108
aVand I pulled on my white paper suit,
p109
aVI put on my respirator,
p110
aVand then
p111
aVI put the plastic bags over my trees.
p112
aVI got my giant syringes,
p113
aVand I injected the bags
p114
aVwith my tracer isotope carbon dioxide gases,
p115
aVfirst the birch.
p116
aVI injected carbon-14, the radioactive gas,
p117
aVinto the bag of birch.
p118
aVAnd then for fir,
p119
aVI injected the stable isotope carbon-13 carbon dioxide gas.
p120
aVI used two isotopes,
p121
aVbecause I was wondering
p122
aVwhether there was two-way communication going on between these species.
p123
aVI got to the final bag,
p124
aVthe 80th replicate,
p125
aVand all of a sudden mama grizzly showed up again.
p126
aVAnd she started to chase me,
p127
aVand I had my syringes above my head,
p128
aVand I was swatting the mosquitos, and I jumped into the truck,
p129
aVand I thought,
p130
aV"This is why people do lab studies."
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VI waited an hour.
p135
aVI figured it would take this long
p136
aVfor the trees to suck up the CO2 through photosynthesis,
p137
aVturn it into sugars, send it down into their roots,
p138
aVand maybe, I hypothesized,
p139
aVshuttle that carbon belowground to their neighbors.
p140
aVAfter the hour was up,
p141
aVI rolled down my window,
p142
aVand I checked for mama grizzly.
p143
aVOh good, she's over there eating her huckleberries.
p144
aVSo I got out of the truck and I got to work.
p145
aVI went to my first bag with the birch. I pulled the bag off.
p146
aVI ran my Geiger counter over its leaves.
p147
aVKkhh!
p148
aVPerfect.
p149
aVThe birch had taken up the radioactive gas.
p150
aVThen the moment of truth.
p151
aVI went over to the fir tree.
p152
aVI pulled off its bag.
p153
aVI ran the Geiger counter up its needles,
p154
aVand I heard the most beautiful sound.
p155
aVKkhh!
p156
aVIt was the sound of birch talking to fir,
p157
aVand birch was saying, "Hey, can I help you?"
p158
aVAnd fir was saying, "Yeah, can you send me some of your carbon?
p159
aVBecause somebody threw a shade cloth over me."
p160
aVI went up to cedar, and I ran the Geiger counter over its leaves,
p161
aVand as I suspected,
p162
aVsilence.
p163
aVCedar was in its own world.
p164
aVIt was not connected into the web interlinking birch and fir.
p165
aa(lp166
VI was so excited,
p167
aVI ran from plot to plot and I checked all 80 replicates.
p168
aVThe evidence was clear.
p169
aVThe C-13 and C-14 was showing me
p170
aVthat paper birch and Douglas fir were in a lively two-way conversation.
p171
aVIt turns out at that time of the year,
p172
aVin the summer,
p173
aVthat birch was sending more carbon to fir than fir was sending back to birch,
p174
aVespecially when the fir was shaded.
p175
aVAnd then in later experiments, we found the opposite,
p176
aVthat fir was sending more carbon to birch than birch was sending to fir,
p177
aVand this was because the fir was still growing while the birch was leafless.
p178
aVSo it turns out the two species were interdependent,
p179
aVlike yin and yang.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd at that moment, everything came into focus for me.
p182
aVI knew I had found something big,
p183
aVsomething that would change the way we look at how trees interact in forests,
p184
aVfrom not just competitors
p185
aVbut to cooperators.
p186
aVAnd I had found solid evidence
p187
aVof this massive belowground communications network,
p188
aVthe other world.
p189
aa(lp190
VNow, I truly hoped and believed
p191
aVthat my discovery would change how we practice forestry,
p192
aVfrom clear-cutting and herbiciding
p193
aVto more holistic and sustainable methods,
p194
aVmethods that were less expensive and more practical.
p195
aVWhat was I thinking?
p196
aVI'll come back to that.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo how do we do science in complex systems like forests?
p199
aVWell, as forest scientists, we have to do our research in the forests,
p200
aVand that's really tough, as I've shown you.
p201
aVAnd we have to be really good at running from bears.
p202
aVBut mostly, we have to persevere
p203
aVin spite of all the stuff stacked against us.
p204
aVAnd we have to follow our intuition and our experiences
p205
aVand ask really good questions.
p206
aVAnd then we've got to gather our data and then go verify.
p207
aVFor me, I've conducted and published hundreds of experiments in the forest.
p208
aVSome of my oldest experimental plantations are now over 30 years old.
p209
aVYou can check them out.
p210
aVThat's how forest science works.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo now I want to talk about the science.
p213
aVHow were paper birch and Douglas fir communicating?
p214
aVWell, it turns out they were conversing not only in the language of carbon
p215
aVbut also nitrogen and phosphorus
p216
aVand water and defense signals and allele chemicals and hormones \u2014
p217
aVinformation.
p218
aVAnd you know, I have to tell you, before me, scientists had thought
p219
aVthat this belowground mutualistic symbiosis called a mycorrhiza
p220
aVwas involved.
p221
aVMycorrhiza literally means "fungus root."
p222
aVYou see their reproductive organs when you walk through the forest.
p223
aVThey're the mushrooms.
p224
aVThe mushrooms, though, are just the tip of the iceberg,
p225
aVbecause coming out of those stems are fungal threads that form a mycelium,
p226
aVand that mycelium infects and colonizes the roots
p227
aVof all the trees and plants.
p228
aVAnd where the fungal cells interact with the root cells,
p229
aVthere's a trade of carbon for nutrients,
p230
aVand that fungus gets those nutrients by growing through the soil
p231
aVand coating every soil particle.
p232
aVThe web is so dense that there can be hundreds of kilometers of mycelium
p233
aVunder a single footstep.
p234
aVAnd not only that, that mycelium connects different individuals in the forest,
p235
aVindividuals not only of the same species but between species, like birch and fir,
p236
aVand it works kind of like the Internet.
p237
aa(lp238
VYou see, like all networks,
p239
aVmycorrhizal networks have nodes and links.
p240
aVWe made this map by examining the short sequences of DNA
p241
aVof every tree and every fungal individual in a patch of Douglas fir forest.
p242
aVIn this picture, the circles represent the Douglas fir, or the nodes,
p243
aVand the lines represent the interlinking fungal highways, or the links.
p244
aa(lp245
VThe biggest, darkest nodes are the busiest nodes.
p246
aVWe call those hub trees,
p247
aVor more fondly, mother trees,
p248
aVbecause it turns out that those hub trees nurture their young,
p249
aVthe ones growing in the understory.
p250
aVAnd if you can see those yellow dots,
p251
aVthose are the young seedlings that have established within the network
p252
aVof the old mother trees.
p253
aVIn a single forest, a mother tree can be connected to hundreds of other trees.
p254
aVAnd using our isotope tracers,
p255
aVwe have found that mother trees
p256
aVwill send their excess carbon through the mycorrhizal network
p257
aVto the understory seedlings,
p258
aVand we've associated this with increased seedling survival
p259
aVby four times.
p260
aa(lp261
VNow, we know we all favor our own children,
p262
aVand I wondered, could Douglas fir recognize its own kin,
p263
aVlike mama grizzly and her cub?
p264
aVSo we set about an experiment,
p265
aVand we grew mother trees with kin and stranger's seedlings.
p266
aVAnd it turns out they do recognize their kin.
p267
aVMother trees colonize their kin with bigger mycorrhizal networks.
p268
aVThey send them more carbon below ground.
p269
aVThey even reduce their own root competition
p270
aVto make elbow room for their kids.
p271
aVWhen mother trees are injured or dying,
p272
aVthey also send messages of wisdom on to the next generation of seedlings.
p273
aVSo we've used isotope tracing
p274
aVto trace carbon moving from an injured mother tree
p275
aVdown her trunk into the mycorrhizal network
p276
aVand into her neighboring seedlings,
p277
aVnot only carbon but also defense signals.
p278
aVAnd these two compounds
p279
aVhave increased the resistance of those seedlings to future stresses.
p280
aVSo trees talk.
p281
aa(lp282
V(Applause)
p283
aa(lp284
VThank you.
p285
aa(lp286
VThrough back and forth conversations,
p287
aVthey increase the resilience of the whole community.
p288
aVIt probably reminds you of our own social communities,
p289
aVand our families,
p290
aVwell, at least some families.
p291
aa(lp292
V(Laughter)
p293
aa(lp294
VSo let's come back to the initial point.
p295
aVForests aren't simply collections of trees,
p296
aVthey're complex systems with hubs and networks
p297
aVthat overlap and connect trees and allow them to communicate,
p298
aVand they provide avenues for feedbacks and adaptation,
p299
aVand this makes the forest resilient.
p300
aVThat's because there are many hub trees and many overlapping networks.
p301
aVBut they're also vulnerable,
p302
aVvulnerable not only to natural disturbances
p303
aVlike bark beetles that preferentially attack big old trees
p304
aVbut high-grade logging and clear-cut logging.
p305
aVYou see, you can take out one or two hub trees,
p306
aVbut there comes a tipping point,
p307
aVbecause hub trees are not unlike rivets in an airplane.
p308
aVYou can take out one or two and the plane still flies,
p309
aVbut you take out one too many,
p310
aVor maybe that one holding on the wings,
p311
aVand the whole system collapses.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo now how are you thinking about forests? Differently?
p314
aa(lp315
V(Audience) Yes.
p316
aa(lp317
VCool.
p318
aVI'm glad.
p319
aa(lp320
VSo, remember I said earlier that I hoped that my research,
p321
aVmy discoveries would change the way we practice forestry.
p322
aVWell, I want to take a check on that 30 years later here in western Canada.
p323
aa(lp324
VThis is about 100 kilometers to the west of us,
p325
aVjust on the border of Banff National Park.
p326
aVThat's a lot of clear-cuts.
p327
aVIt's not so pristine.
p328
aVIn 2014, the World Resources Institute reported that Canada in the past decade
p329
aVhas had the highest forest disturbance rate of any country worldwide,
p330
aVand I bet you thought it was Brazil.
p331
aVIn Canada, it's 3.6 percent per year.
p332
aVNow, by my estimation, that's about four times the rate that is sustainable.
p333
aa(lp334
VNow, massive disturbance at this scale is known to affect hydrological cycles,
p335
aVdegrade wildlife habitat,
p336
aVand emit greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere,
p337
aVwhich creates more disturbance and more tree diebacks.
p338
aa(lp339
VNot only that, we're continuing to plant one or two species
p340
aVand weed out the aspens and birches.
p341
aVThese simplified forests lack complexity,
p342
aVand they're really vulnerable to infections and bugs.
p343
aVAnd as climate changes,
p344
aVthis is creating a perfect storm
p345
aVfor extreme events, like the massive mountain pine beetle outbreak
p346
aVthat just swept across North America,
p347
aVor that megafire in the last couple months in Alberta.
p348
aa(lp349
VSo I want to come back to my final question:
p350
aVinstead of weakening our forests,
p351
aVhow can we reinforce them and help them deal with climate change?
p352
aVWell, you know, the great thing about forests as complex systems
p353
aVis they have enormous capacity to self-heal.
p354
aVIn our recent experiments,
p355
aVwe found with patch-cutting and retention of hub trees
p356
aVand regeneration to a diversity of species and genes and genotypes
p357
aVthat these mycorrhizal networks, they recover really rapidly.
p358
aVSo with this in mind, I want to leave you with four simple solutions.
p359
aVAnd we can't kid ourselves that these are too complicated to act on.
p360
aa(lp361
VFirst, we all need to get out in the forest.
p362
aVWe need to reestablish local involvement in our own forests.
p363
aVYou see, most of our forests now
p364
aVare managed using a one-size-fits-all approach,
p365
aVbut good forest stewardship requires knowledge of local conditions.
p366
aa(lp367
VSecond, we need to save our old-growth forests.
p368
aVThese are the repositories of genes and mother trees and mycorrhizal networks.
p369
aVSo this means less cutting.
p370
aVI don't mean no cutting, but less cutting.
p371
aa(lp372
VAnd third, when we do cut,
p373
aVwe need to save the legacies,
p374
aVthe mother trees and networks,
p375
aVand the wood, the genes,
p376
aVso they can pass their wisdom onto the next generation of trees
p377
aVso they can withstand the future stresses coming down the road.
p378
aVWe need to be conservationists.
p379
aa(lp380
VAnd finally, fourthly and finally,
p381
aVwe need to regenerate our forests with a diversity of species
p382
aVand genotypes and structures
p383
aVby planting and allowing natural regeneration.
p384
aVWe have to give Mother Nature the tools she needs
p385
aVto use her intelligence to self-heal.
p386
aVAnd we need to remember that forests aren't just a bunch of trees
p387
aVcompeting with each other,
p388
aVthey're supercooperators.
p389
aa(lp390
VSo back to Jigs.
p391
aVJigs's fall into the outhouse showed me this other world,
p392
aVand it changed my view of forests.
p393
aVI hope today to have changed how you think about forests.
p394
aa(lp395
VThank you.
