VI'm here to share my photography.
p4
aVOr is it photography?
p5
aVBecause, of course, this is a photograph
p6
aVthat you can't take with your camera.
p7
aa(lp8
VYet, my interest in photography started
p9
aVas I got my first digital camera
p10
aVat the age of 15.
p11
aVIt mixed with my earlier passion for drawing,
p12
aVbut it was a bit different,
p13
aVbecause using the camera,
p14
aVthe process was in the planning instead.
p15
aVAnd when you take a photograph with a camera,
p16
aVthe process ends when you press the trigger.
p17
aVSo to me it felt like photography was more about
p18
aVbeing at the right place and the right time.
p19
aVI felt like anyone could do that.
p20
aa(lp21
VSo I wanted to create something different,
p22
aVsomething where the process starts
p23
aVwhen you press the trigger.
p24
aVPhotos like this:
p25
aVconstruction going on along a busy road.
p26
aVBut it has an unexpected twist.
p27
aVAnd despite that,
p28
aVit retains a level of realism.
p29
aVOr photos like these \u2014
p30
aVboth dark and colorful,
p31
aVbut all with a common goal
p32
aVof retaining the level of realism.
p33
aVWhen I say realism,
p34
aVI mean photo-realism.
p35
aVBecause, of course,
p36
aVit's not something you can capture really,
p37
aVbut I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow
p38
aVas a photograph.
p39
aVPhotos where you will need a brief moment to think
p40
aVto figure out the trick.
p41
aVSo it's more about capturing an idea
p42
aVthan about capturing a moment really.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut what's the trick
p45
aVthat makes it look realistic?
p46
aVIs it something about the details
p47
aVor the colors?
p48
aVIs it something about the light?
p49
aVWhat creates the illusion?
p50
aVSometimes the perspective is the illusion.
p51
aVBut in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world
p52
aVand how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface.
p53
aVIt's not really what is realistic,
p54
aVit's what we think looks realistic really.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo I think the basics
p57
aVare quite simple.
p58
aVI just see it as a puzzle of reality
p59
aVwhere you can take different pieces of reality and put it together
p60
aVto create alternate reality.
p61
aVAnd let me show you a simple example.
p62
aVHere we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects,
p63
aVsomething we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world.
p64
aVBut combined in a certain way,
p65
aVthey can create something that still looks three-dimensional,
p66
aVlike it could exist.
p67
aVBut at the same time, we know it can't.
p68
aVSo we trick our brains,
p69
aVbecause our brain simply doesn't accept the fact
p70
aVthat it doesn't really make sense.
p71
aVAnd I see the same process
p72
aVwith combining photographs.
p73
aVIt's just really about combining different realities.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo the things that make a photograph look realistic,
p76
aVI think it's the things that we don't even think about,
p77
aVthe things all around us in our daily lives.
p78
aVBut when combining photographs,
p79
aVthis is really important to consider,
p80
aVbecause otherwise it just looks wrong somehow.
p81
aVSo I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow
p82
aVto achieve a realistic result.
p83
aVAs you can see, these images aren't really special.
p84
aVBut combined, they can create something like this.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo the first rule is that photos combined
p87
aVshould have the same perspective.
p88
aVSecondly, photos combined
p89
aVshould have the same type of light.
p90
aVAnd these two images both fulfill these two requirements \u2014
p91
aVshot at the same height and in the same type of light.
p92
aVThe third one is about making it impossible to distinguish
p93
aVwhere the different images begin and end
p94
aVby making it seamless.
p95
aVMake it impossible to say
p96
aVhow the image actually was composed.
p97
aVSo by matching color, contrast and brightness
p98
aVin the borders between the different images,
p99
aVadding photographic defects
p100
aVlike depth of field,
p101
aVdesaturated colors and noise,
p102
aVwe erase the borders between the different images
p103
aVand make it look like one single image,
p104
aVdespite the fact that one image
p105
aVcan contain hundreds of layers basically.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo here's another example.
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aVOne might think that this is just an image of a landscape
p110
aVand the lower part is what's manipulated.
p111
aVBut this image is actually entirely composed
p112
aVof photographs from different locations.
p113
aVI personally think that it's easier to actually create a place
p114
aVthan to find a place,
p115
aVbecause then you don't need to compromise
p116
aVwith the ideas in your head.
p117
aVBut it does require a lot of planning.
p118
aVAnd getting this idea during winter,
p119
aVI knew that I had several months to plan it,
p120
aVto find the different locations
p121
aVfor the pieces of the puzzle basically.
p122
aVSo for example,
p123
aVthe fish was captured on a fishing trip.
p124
aVThe shores are from a different location.
p125
aVThe underwater part was captured in a stone pit.
p126
aVAnd yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red
p127
aVto make it look more Swedish.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo to achieve a realistic result,
p130
aVI think it comes down to planning.
p131
aVIt always starts with a sketch, an idea.
p132
aVThen it's about combining the different photographs.
p133
aVAnd here every piece is very well planned.
p134
aVAnd if you do a good job capturing the photos,
p135
aVthe result can be quite beautiful
p136
aVand also quite realistic.
p137
aVSo all the tools are out there,
p138
aVand the only thing that limits us
p139
aVis our imagination.
