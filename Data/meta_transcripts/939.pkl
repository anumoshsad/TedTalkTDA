VCartoons are basically short stories.
p4
aVI tried to find one that didn't have a whole lot of words.
p5
aVNot all of them have happy endings.
p6
aVSo how did I get started cartooning?
p7
aVI doodled a lot as a kid,
p8
aVand if you spend enough time doodling,
p9
aVsooner or later, something happens:
p10
aVall your career options run out.
p11
aVSo you have to make a living cartooning.
p12
aa(lp13
VActually, I fell in love with the ocean when I was a little boy,
p14
aVwhen I was about eight or nine.
p15
aVAnd I was particularly fascinated with sharks.
p16
aVThis is some of my early work.
p17
aVEventually, my mom took the red crayon away,
p18
aVso it was [unclear].
p19
aVBut I'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine
p20
aVthat really made me see the ocean differently,
p21
aVand it's become the foundation of my work
p22
aVbecause, I feel like, if in a day,
p23
aVI can see the ocean differently,
p24
aVthen I can evoke that same kind of change in others,
p25
aVespecially kids.
p26
aVBefore that day, this is how I saw the ocean.
p27
aVIt's just a big blue surface.
p28
aVAnd this is how we've seen the ocean since the beginning of time.
p29
aVIt's a mystery.
p30
aVThere's been a lot of folklore
p31
aVdeveloped around the ocean,
p32
aVmostly negative.
p33
aVAnd that prompted people to make maps like this,
p34
aVwith all kinds of wonderful detail on the land,
p35
aVbut when you get to the waters edge,
p36
aVthe ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint.
p37
aVAnd this is the way I saw the ocean at school \u2014
p38
aVas if to say, "All geography and science lessons
p39
aVstop at water's edge.
p40
aVThis part's not going to be on the test."
p41
aa(lp42
VBut that day I flew low over the islands \u2014
p43
aVit was a family trip to the Caribbean,
p44
aVand I flew in a small plane low over the islands.
p45
aVThis is what I saw. I saw hills and valleys.
p46
aVI saw forests and meadows.
p47
aVI saw grottoes and secret gardens
p48
aVand places I'd love to hide as a kid,
p49
aVif I could only breathe underwater.
p50
aVAnd best of all, I saw the animals.
p51
aVI saw a manta ray that looked as big as the plane I was flying in.
p52
aVAnd I flew over a lagoon with a shark in it,
p53
aVand that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo from that day on, I was an ordinary kid
p56
aVwalking around on dry land,
p57
aVbut my head was down there, underwater.
p58
aVUp until that day,
p59
aVthese were the animals that were most common in my life.
p60
aVThese were the ones I'd like to draw \u2014
p61
aVall variations of four legs and fur.
p62
aVBut when you got to the ocean,
p63
aVmy imagination was no competition for nature.
p64
aVEvery time I'd come up with a crazy cartoon character on the drawing board,
p65
aVI'd find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier.
p66
aVAnd the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon
p67
aVand this enormous humpback whale
p68
aVwas like something out of a science-fiction movie.
p69
aa(lp70
VWhenever I talk to kids, I always like to tell them,
p71
aVthe biggest animal that ever lived is still alive.
p72
aVIt's not a dinosaur; it's a whale,
p73
aVanimals as big as office buildings
p74
aVstill swimming around out there in our ocean.
p75
aVSpeaking of dinosaurs, sharks are basically
p76
aVthe same fish they were 300 million years ago.
p77
aVSo if you ever fantasize about going back in time
p78
aVand seeing what a dinosaur looked like,
p79
aVthat's what a dinosaur looks like.
p80
aVSo you have living dinosaurs
p81
aVand space aliens,
p82
aVanimals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions.
p83
aVIt's just incredible; no Hollywood designer
p84
aVcould come up with something more interesting than that.
p85
aVOr this fangtooth. The particles in the water
p86
aVmake it look like it's floating in outer space.
p87
aVCould you image if we looked through the Hubble Telescope
p88
aVand we saw that?
p89
aVIt would start a whole new space race.
p90
aVBut instead, we stick a camera in the deep ocean,
p91
aVand we see a fish, and it doesn't capture our imagination
p92
aVas a society.
p93
aVWe say to ourselves,
p94
aV"Maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something."
p95
aa(lp96
VSo, what I'd like to do now
p97
aVis try a little drawing.
p98
aVSo, I'm going to try to draw this fangtooth here.
p99
aVI love to draw the deep sea fish,
p100
aVbecause they are so ugly,
p101
aVbut beautiful in their own way.
p102
aVMaybe we can give him a little bioluminescence here \u2014
p103
aVgive him a headlight,
p104
aVmaybe a brake light,
p105
aVturn signals.
p106
aVBut it's easy to see why these animals
p107
aVmake such great cartoon characters,
p108
aVtheir shapes and sizes.
p109
aVSo some of them actually seem to have powers
p110
aVlike superheroes in a comic book.
p111
aVFor instance,
p112
aVtake these sea turtles.
p113
aVThey kind of have a sixth sense
p114
aVlike Superman's x-ray vision.
p115
aVThey can sense the magnetic fields of the earth.
p116
aVAnd they can use that sense
p117
aVto navigate hundreds of miles of open ocean.
p118
aVI kind of give my turtle hands
p119
aVjust to make them an easier cartoon character to work with.
p120
aVOr take this sea cucumber.
p121
aVIt's not an animal we draw cartoons of
p122
aVor draw at all.
p123
aVHe's like an underwater Spiderman.
p124
aVHe shoots out these sticky webs
p125
aVto entangle his enemy.
p126
aVOf course, sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears,
p127
aVwhich, in my opinion, makes them much more interesting a superhero.
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aVHe can't spin a web anytime; he's got to pull his pants down first.
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VOr the blowfish.
p134
aVThe blowfish is like the Incredible Hulk.
p135
aVIt can change its body
p136
aVinto a big, intimidating fish
p137
aVin a matter of seconds.
p138
aVI'm going to draw this blowfish uninflated.
p139
aVAnd then I'm going to attempt
p140
aVonscreen animation here.
p141
aVLet's see.
p142
aVTry and inflate it.
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aV"You talkin' to me?" See, he can inflate himself
p145
aVwhen he wants to be intimidating.
p146
aVOr take this swordfish.
p147
aVCould you imagine being born with a tool for a nose?
p148
aVDo you think he wakes up in the morning, looks in the mirror and says,
p149
aV"Somebody's getting stabbed today."
p150
aVOr this lionfish for instance.
p151
aVImagine trying to make friends
p152
aVcovered with razor-sharp poisonous barbs.
p153
aVIt's not something you want to put on your Facebook page, right?
p154
aa(lp155
VMy characters are \u2014
p156
aVmy lead character's a shark named Sherman.
p157
aVHe's a great white shark.
p158
aVAnd I kind of broke the mold with Sherman.
p159
aVI didn't want to go with this ruthless
p160
aVpredator image.
p161
aVHe's kind of just out there making a living.
p162
aVHe's sort of a Homer Simpson with fins.
p163
aVAnd then his sidekick
p164
aVis a sea turtle, as I mentioned before, named Filmore.
p165
aVHe uses his wonderful skills at navigation
p166
aVto wander the oceans, looking for a mate.
p167
aVAnd he does manage to find them,
p168
aVbut great navigation skills, lousy pick-up lines.
p169
aVHe never seems
p170
aVto settle on
p171
aVany particular girl.
p172
aVI have a hermit crab named Hawthorne,
p173
aVwho doesn't get a lot of respect as a hermit crab,
p174
aVso he kind of wishes
p175
aVhe were a great white shark.
p176
aVAnd then I'll introduce you to one more character,
p177
aVthis guy, Ernest,
p178
aVwho is basically a juvenile delinquent
p179
aVin a fish body.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo with characters, you can make stories.
p182
aVSometimes making a story is as easy
p183
aVas putting two characters in a room
p184
aVand seeing what happens.
p185
aVSo, imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom.
p186
aV(Laughter)
p187
aVOr, sometimes I take them to places
p188
aVthat people have never heard of because they're underwater.
p189
aVFor instance, I took them skiing in the Mid-Atlantic Range,
p190
aVwhich is this range of mountains in the middle of the Atlantic.
p191
aVI've taken them to the Sea of Japan,
p192
aVwhere they met giant jellyfish.
p193
aVI've taken them camping in the kelp forests of California.
p194
aa(lp195
VThis next one here,
p196
aVI did a story on the census of marine life.
p197
aVAnd that was a lot of fun because, as most of you know,
p198
aVit's a real project we've heard about.
p199
aVBut it was a chance for me to introduce readers
p200
aVto a lot of crazy undersea characters.
p201
aVSo we start off the story with Ernest,
p202
aVwho volunteers as a census taker.
p203
aVHe goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish.
p204
aVThen he meets the yeti crab,
p205
aVthe famous vampire squid \u2014 elusive, hard to find \u2014
p206
aVand the Dumbo octopus, which looks so much like a cartoon in real life
p207
aVthat really didn't have to change a thing when I drew it.
p208
aa(lp209
VI did another story on marine debris.
p210
aVI was speaking to a lot of my friends
p211
aVin the conservation business,
p212
aVand they \u2014
p213
aVI asked them, "So what's one issue you would like everyone to know more about?"
p214
aVAnd they said \u2014 this one friend of mine said,
p215
aV"I've got one word for you: plastic."
p216
aVAnd I told him, "Well, I need something a little sexier than that.
p217
aVPlastic just is not going to do it."
p218
aVWe sort of worked things out.
p219
aVHe wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride,
p220
aVwhich doesn't really work in voice balloons very well.
p221
aVI couldn't fit them in.
p222
aVSo what I did was I made an adventure strip.
p223
aa(lp224
VBasically, this bottle travels a long way.
p225
aVWhat I'm trying to tell readers
p226
aVis that plastic doesn't really go away;
p227
aVit just continues to wash downstream.
p228
aVAnd a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean,
p229
aVwhich is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it,
p230
aVespecially if they can't stand each other, like these two.
p231
aVSo, I sent them to Boise, Idaho,
p232
aVwhere they dropped a plastic bottle
p233
aVinto the Boise sewer system.
p234
aVAnd it ended up in the Boise River
p235
aVand then on to the Columbia River
p236
aVand then to the mouth of the Columbia
p237
aVand to the Pacific Ocean
p238
aVand then on to this place called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch \u2014
p239
aVwhich is this giant Pacific gyre in the North Pacific,
p240
aVwhere a lot of this plastic ends up floating around \u2014
p241
aVand then back onto the lagoon.
p242
aVSo that was basically a buddy story
p243
aVwith a plastic bottle following along.
p244
aVSo a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway,
p245
aVbut we really talked about marine debris and plastic
p246
aVin the course of that one.
p247
aa(lp248
VThe third storyline I did about a year and a half ago
p249
aVwas probably my most difficult.
p250
aVIt was on shark finning, and I felt really strongly
p251
aVabout this issue.
p252
aVAnd I felt like, since my main character was a shark,
p253
aVthe comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this.
p254
aVNow, finning is the act
p255
aVof taking a shark, cutting the valuable fins off
p256
aVand throwing the live animal back in the water.
p257
aVIt's cruel, it's wasteful.
p258
aVThere's nothing funny or entertaining about it,
p259
aVbut I really wanted to take this issue on.
p260
aVI had to kill my main character, who is a shark.
p261
aa(lp262
VWe start with Sherman in a Chinese restaurant,
p263
aVwho gets a fortune that he's about to get caught by a trawler,
p264
aVwhich he does.
p265
aVAnd then he dies.
p266
aVHe gets finned, and then he gets thrown overboard.
p267
aVOstensibly, he's dead now.
p268
aVAnd so I killed a character that's been in the newspaper for 15 years.
p269
aVSo I got a lot of reader feedback on that one.
p270
aVMeanwhile, the other characters are talking about shark fin soup.
p271
aVI do three or four strips after that
p272
aVwhere we explore the finning issue
p273
aVand the shark fin soup issue.
p274
aVSherman's up in shark heaven.
p275
aVThis is what I love about comic strips, you know.
p276
aVYou really don't have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief
p277
aVbecause, if you start with a talking shark,
p278
aVreaders pretty much check their disbelief at the door.
p279
aVYou can kind of do anything.
p280
aVIt becomes a near-death experience for Sherman.
p281
aVMeanwhile, Ernest finds his fins on the internet.
p282
aVThere was a real website based in China
p283
aVthat actually sold shark fins,
p284
aVso I kind of exposed that.
p285
aVAnd he clicks the "buy now" button.
p286
aVAnd voila, next-day air, they show up,
p287
aVand they surgically reattach them.
p288
aVI ended that series with a kind of a mail-in petition
p289
aVthat encouraged our National Marine Fishery Service,
p290
aVto force other countries
p291
aVto have a stronger stance with shark management.
p292
aa(lp293
V(Applause)
p294
aa(lp295
VThanks.
p296
aVI'd like to end with a little metaphor here.
p297
aVI've been trying to think of a metaphor to represent Mission Blue,
p298
aVand this is what I came up with.
p299
aVImagine you're in an enormous room,
p300
aVand it's as dark as a cave.
p301
aVAnd you can have anything in that room, anything you want,
p302
aVbut you can't see anything.
p303
aVYou've been given one tool, a hammer.
p304
aVSo you wander around in the darkness, and you bump into something,
p305
aVand it feels like it's made of stone.
p306
aVIt's big, it's heavy. You can't carry it away,
p307
aVso you bang it with your hammer, and you break off a piece.
p308
aVAnd you take the piece out into the daylight.
p309
aVAnd you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster.
p310
aVSo you say to yourself, "Well, that's worth something."
p311
aVSo you go back into the room,
p312
aVand you break this thing to pieces, and you haul it away.
p313
aVAnd you find other things, and you break that up, and you haul those away.
p314
aVAnd you're getting all kinds of cool stuff.
p315
aVAnd you hear other people doing the same thing.
p316
aVSo you get this sense of urgency,
p317
aVlike you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible.
p318
aVAnd then some yells, "Stop!"
p319
aVAnd they turn up the lights.
p320
aVAnd you realize where you are; you're in the Louvre.
p321
aVAnd you've taken all this complexity and beauty,
p322
aVand you've turned it into a cheap commodity.
p323
aa(lp324
VAnd that's what we're doing with the ocean.
p325
aVAnd part of what Mission Blue is about
p326
aVis yelling, "Stop!"
p327
aVso that each of us \u2014
p328
aVexplorer, scientist, cartoonist, singer, chef \u2014
p329
aVcan turn up the lights in their own way.
p330
aVAnd that's what I hope my comic strip does in a small way.
p331
aVThat's why I like what I do.
p332
aa(lp333
VThanks for listening.
