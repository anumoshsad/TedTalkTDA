VI'm a neuroscientist, and I study decision-making.
p4
aVI do experiments to test how different chemicals
p5
aVin the brain influence the choices we make.
p6
aa(lp7
VI'm here to tell you the secret to successful decision-making:
p8
aVa cheese sandwich.
p9
aVThat's right. According to scientists, a cheese sandwich
p10
aVis the solution to all your tough decisions.
p11
aa(lp12
VHow do I know? I'm the scientist who did the study.
p13
aa(lp14
VA few years ago, my colleagues and I were interested
p15
aVin how a brain chemical called serotonin
p16
aVwould influence people's decisions in social situations.
p17
aVSpecifically, we wanted to know how serotonin would affect
p18
aVthe way people react when they're treated unfairly.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo we did an experiment.
p21
aVWe manipulated people's serotonin levels by giving them
p22
aVthis really disgusting-tasting artificial lemon-flavored drink
p23
aVthat works by taking away the raw ingredient for serotonin
p24
aVin the brain.
p25
aVThis is the amino acid tryptophan.
p26
aVSo what we found was, when tryptophan was low,
p27
aVpeople were more likely to take revenge
p28
aVwhen they're treated unfairly.
p29
aa(lp30
VThat's the study we did, and here are some of the headlines
p31
aVthat came out afterwards.
p32
aa(lp33
V("A cheese sandwich is all you need for strong decision-making")
p34
aa(lp35
V("What a friend we have in cheeses")
p36
aa(lp37
V("Eating Cheese and Meat May Boost Self-Control") At this point, you might be wondering, did I miss something?
p38
aa(lp39
V("Official! Chocolate stops you being grumpy") Cheese? Chocolate? Where did that come from?
p40
aVAnd I thought the same thing myself when these came out,
p41
aVbecause our study had nothing to do with cheese or chocolate.
p42
aVWe gave people this horrible-tasting drink
p43
aVthat affected their tryptophan levels.
p44
aVBut it turns out that tryptophan also happens to be found
p45
aVin cheese and chocolate.
p46
aVAnd of course when science says cheese and chocolate
p47
aVhelp you make better decisions, well, that's sure to grab people's attention.
p48
aVSo there you have it:
p49
aVthe evolution of a headline.
p50
aa(lp51
VWhen this happened, a part of me thought, well,
p52
aVwhat's the big deal?
p53
aVSo the media oversimplified a few things, but in the end,
p54
aVit's just a news story.
p55
aVAnd I think a lot of scientists have this attitude.
p56
aVBut the problem is that this kind of thing happens all the time,
p57
aVand it affects not just the stories you read in the news
p58
aVbut also the products you see on the shelves.
p59
aVWhen the headlines rolled, what happened was,
p60
aVthe marketers came calling.
p61
aVWould I be willing to provide a scientific endorsement
p62
aVof a mood-boosting bottled water?
p63
aVOr would I go on television to demonstrate,
p64
aVin front of a live audience,
p65
aVthat comfort foods really do make you feel better?
p66
aVI think these folks meant well, but had I taken them up on their offers,
p67
aVI would have been going beyond the science,
p68
aVand good scientists are careful not to do this.
p69
aa(lp70
VBut nevertheless, neuroscience is turning up more and more in marketing.
p71
aVHere's one example: Neuro drinks,
p72
aVa line of products, including Nuero Bliss here,
p73
aVwhich according to its label helps reduce stress,
p74
aVenhances mood, provides focused concentration,
p75
aVand promotes a positive outlook.
p76
aVI have to say, this sounds awesome. (Laughter)
p77
aVI could totally have used this 10 minutes ago.
p78
aVSo when this came up in my local shop, naturally I was
p79
aVcurious about some of the research backing these claims.
p80
aVSo I went to the company's website looking to find
p81
aVsome controlled trials of their products.
p82
aVBut I didn't find any.
p83
aa(lp84
VTrial or no trial, these claims are front and center
p85
aVon their label right next to a picture of a brain.
p86
aVAnd it turns out that pictures of brains have special properties.
p87
aVA couple of researchers asked a few hundred people
p88
aVto read a scientific article.
p89
aVFor half the people, the article included a brain image,
p90
aVand for the other half, it was the same article
p91
aVbut it didn't have a brain image.
p92
aVAt the end \u2014 you see where this is going \u2014
p93
aVpeople were asked whether they agreed
p94
aVwith the conclusions of the article.
p95
aVSo this is how much people agree with the conclusions
p96
aVwith no image.
p97
aVAnd this is how much they agree with the same article
p98
aVthat did include a brain image.
p99
aVSo the take-home message here is,
p100
aVdo you want to sell it? Put a brain on it.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow let me pause here and take a moment to say that
p103
aVneuroscience has advanced a lot in the last few decades,
p104
aVand we're constantly discovering amazing things
p105
aVabout the brain.
p106
aVLike, just a couple of weeks ago, neuroscientists at MIT
p107
aVfigured out how to break habits in rats
p108
aVjust by controlling neural activity in a specific part of their brain.
p109
aVReally cool stuff.
p110
aVBut the promise of neuroscience has led to some really
p111
aVhigh expectations and some overblown, unproven claims.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo what I'm going to do is show you how to spot
p114
aVa couple of classic moves, dead giveaways, really,
p115
aVfor what's variously been called neuro-bunk,
p116
aVneuro-bollocks, or, my personal favorite, neuro-flapdoodle.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans
p119
aVto read people's thoughts and emotions.
p120
aVHere's a study published by a team of researchers
p121
aVas an op-ed in The New York Times.
p122
aVThe headline? "You Love Your iPhone. Literally."
p123
aVIt quickly became the most emailed article on the site.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo how'd they figure this out?
p126
aVThey put 16 people inside a brain scanner
p127
aVand showed them videos of ringing iPhones.
p128
aVThe brain scans showed activation in a part of the brain
p129
aVcalled the insula, a region they say
p130
aVis linked to feelings of love and compassion.
p131
aVSo they concluded that because they saw activation in the insula,
p132
aVthis meant the subjects loved their iPhones.
p133
aVNow there's just one problem with this line of reasoning,
p134
aVand that's that the insula does a lot.
p135
aVSure, it is involved in positive emotions
p136
aVlike love and compassion,
p137
aVbut it's also involved in tons of other processes,
p138
aVlike memory, language, attention,
p139
aVeven anger, disgust and pain.
p140
aVSo based on the same logic, I could equally conclude
p141
aVyou hate your iPhone.
p142
aVThe point here is, when you see activation in the insula,
p143
aVyou can't just pick and choose your favorite explanation
p144
aVfrom off this list, and it's a really long list.
p145
aVMy colleagues Tal Yarkoni and Russ Poldrack
p146
aVhave shown that the insula pops up in almost a third
p147
aVof all brain imaging studies that have ever been published.
p148
aVSo chances are really, really good
p149
aVthat your insula is going off right now,
p150
aVbut I won't kid myself
p151
aVto think this means you love me.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo speaking of love and the brain,
p154
aVthere's a researcher, known to some as Dr. Love,
p155
aVwho claims that scientists have found the glue
p156
aVthat holds society together,
p157
aVthe source of love and prosperity.
p158
aVThis time it's not a cheese sandwich.
p159
aVNo, it's a hormone called oxytocin.
p160
aVYou've probably heard of it.
p161
aVSo, Dr. Love bases his argument on studies showing
p162
aVthat when you boost people's oxytocin,
p163
aVthis increases their trust, empathy and cooperation.
p164
aVSo he's calling oxytocin "the moral molecule."
p165
aa(lp166
VNow these studies are scientifically valid,
p167
aVand they've been replicated, but they're not the whole story.
p168
aVOther studies have shown that boosting oxytocin
p169
aVincreases envy. It increases gloating.
p170
aVOxytocin can bias people to favor their own group
p171
aVat the expense of other groups.
p172
aVAnd in some cases, oxytocin can even decrease cooperation.
p173
aVSo based on these studies, I could say oxytocin
p174
aVis an immoral molecule, and call myself Dr. Strangelove.
p175
aV(Laughter)
p176
aa(lp177
VSo we've seen neuro-flapdoodle all over the headlines.
p178
aVWe see it in supermarkets, on book covers.
p179
aVWhat about the clinic?
p180
aa(lp181
VSPECT imaging is a brain-scanning technology
p182
aVthat uses a radioactive tracer
p183
aVto track blood flow in the brain.
p184
aVFor the bargain price of a few thousand dollars,
p185
aVthere are clinics in the U.S. that will give you
p186
aVone of these SPECT scans and use the image
p187
aVto help diagnose your problems.
p188
aVThese scans, the clinics say, can help
p189
aVprevent Alzheimer's disease,
p190
aVsolve weight and addiction issues,
p191
aVovercome marital conflicts,
p192
aVand treat, of course, a variety of mental illnesses
p193
aVranging from depression to anxiety to ADHD.
p194
aVThis sounds great. A lot of people agree.
p195
aVSome of these clinics are pulling in tens of millions
p196
aVof dollars a year in business.
p197
aa(lp198
VThere's just one problem.
p199
aVThe broad consensus in neuroscience
p200
aVis that we can't yet diagnose mental illness
p201
aVfrom a single brain scan.
p202
aVBut these clinics have treated
p203
aVtens of thousands of patients to date,
p204
aVmany of them children,
p205
aVand SPECT imaging involves a radioactive injection,
p206
aVso exposing people to radiation, potentially harmful.
p207
aa(lp208
VI am more excited than most people, as a neuroscientist,
p209
aVabout the potential for neuroscience to treat mental illness
p210
aVand even maybe to make us better and smarter.
p211
aVAnd if one day we can say that cheese and chocolate
p212
aVhelp us make better decisions, count me in.
p213
aVBut we're not there yet.
p214
aVWe haven't found a "buy" button inside the brain,
p215
aVwe can't tell whether someone is lying or in love
p216
aVjust by looking at their brain scans,
p217
aVand we can't turn sinners into saints with hormones.
p218
aVMaybe someday we will, but until then,
p219
aVwe have to be careful that we don't let overblown claims
p220
aVdetract resources and attention away from the real science
p221
aVthat's playing a much longer game.
p222
aa(lp223
VSo here's where you come in.
p224
aVIf someone tries to sell you something with a brain on it,
p225
aVdon't just take them at their word.
p226
aVAsk the tough questions. Ask to see the evidence.
p227
aVAsk for the part of the story that's not being told.
p228
aVThe answers shouldn't be simple, because the brain isn't simple.
p229
aVBut that's not stopping us from trying to figure it out anyway.
p230
aa(lp231
