VTen years ago,
p4
aVI had my first exhibition here.
p5
aVI had no idea if it would work or was at all possible,
p6
aVbut with a few small steps and a very steep learning curve,
p7
aVI made my first sculpture, called "The Lost Correspondent."
p8
aVTeaming up with a marine biologist and a local dive center,
p9
aVI submerged the work off the coast of Grenada,
p10
aVin an area decimated by Hurricane Ivan.
p11
aVAnd then this incredible thing happened.
p12
aVIt transformed.
p13
aVOne sculpture became two.
p14
aVTwo quickly became 26.
p15
aVAnd before I knew it,
p16
aVwe had the world's first underwater sculpture park.
p17
aa(lp18
VIn 2009, I moved to Mexico and started by casting local fisherman.
p19
aVThis grew to a small community,
p20
aVto almost an entire movement of people in defense of the sea.
p21
aVAnd then finally, to an underwater museum,
p22
aVwith over 500 living sculptures.
p23
aVGardening, it seems, is not just for greenhouses.
p24
aVWe've since scaled up the designs:
p25
aV"Ocean Atlas," in the Bahamas, rising 16 feet up to the surface
p26
aVand weighing over 40 tons,
p27
aVto now currently in Lanzarote,
p28
aVwhere I'm making an underwater botanical garden,
p29
aVthe first of its kind in the Atlantic Ocean.
p30
aa(lp31
VEach project, we use materials and designs that help encourage life;
p32
aVa long-lasting pH-neutral cement provides a stable and permanent platform.
p33
aVIt is textured to allow coral polyps to attach.
p34
aVWe position them down current from natural reefs
p35
aVso that after spawning, there's areas for them to settle.
p36
aVThe formations are all configured so that they aggregate fish
p37
aVon a really large scale.
p38
aVEven this VW Beetle has an internal living habitat
p39
aVto encourage crustaceans such as lobsters and sea urchins.
p40
aa(lp41
VSo why exhibit my work in the ocean?
p42
aVBecause honestly, it's really not easy.
p43
aVWhen you're in the middle of the sea under a hundred-foot crane,
p44
aVtrying to lower eight tons down to the sea floor,
p45
aVyou start to wonder whether I shouldn't have taken up watercolor painting instead.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VBut in the end, the results always blow my mind.
p50
aa(lp51
V(Music)
p52
aa(lp53
VThe ocean is the most incredible exhibition space
p54
aVan artist could ever wish for.
p55
aVYou have amazing lighting effects changing by the hour,
p56
aVexplosions of sand covering the sculptures in a cloud of mystery,
p57
aVa unique timeless quality
p58
aVand the procession of inquisitive visitors,
p59
aVeach lending their own special touch to the site.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Music)
p62
aa(lp63
VBut over the years,
p64
aVI've realized that the greatest thing about what we do,
p65
aVthe really humbling thing about the work,
p66
aVis that as soon as we submerge the sculptures,
p67
aVthey're not ours anymore,
p68
aVbecause as soon as we sink them,
p69
aVthe sculptures, they belong to the sea.
p70
aVAs new reefs form, a new world literally starts to evolve,
p71
aVa world that continuously amazes me.
p72
aVIt's a bit of a cliché, but nothing man-made
p73
aVcan ever match the imagination of nature.
p74
aa(lp75
VSponges look like veins across the faces.
p76
aVStaghorn coral morphs the form.
p77
aVFireworms scrawl white lines as they feed.
p78
aVTunicates explode from the faces.
p79
aVSea urchins crawl across the bodies feeding at night.
p80
aVCoralline algae applies a kind of purple paint.
p81
aVThe deepest red I've ever seen in my life lives underwater.
p82
aVGorgonian fans oscillate with the waves.
p83
aVPurple sponges breathe water like air.
p84
aVAnd grey angelfish glide silently overhead.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd the amazing response we've had to these works
p87
aVtells me that we've managed to plug into something really primal,
p88
aVbecause it seems that these images translate across the world,
p89
aVand that's made me focus on my responsibility as an artist
p90
aVand about what I'm trying to achieve.
p91
aVI'm standing here today on this boat in the middle of the ocean,
p92
aVand this couldn't be a better place
p93
aVto talk about the really, really important effect of my work.
p94
aVBecause as we all know,
p95
aVour reefs are dying, and our oceans are in trouble.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo here's the thing:
p98
aVthe most used, searched and shared image
p99
aVof all my work thus far is this.
p100
aVAnd I think this is for a reason,
p101
aVor at least I hope it is.
p102
aVWhat I really hope is that people are beginning to understand
p103
aVthat when we think of the environment and the destruction of nature,
p104
aVthat we need to start thinking about our oceans, too.
p105
aa(lp106
VSince building these sites, we've seen some phenomenal
p107
aVand unexpected results.
p108
aVBesides creating over 800 square meters of new habitats and living reef,
p109
aVvisitors to the marine park in Cancun now divide half their time
p110
aVbetween the museum and the natural reefs,
p111
aVproviding significant rest for natural, overstressed areas.
p112
aVVisitors to "Ocean Atlas" in the Bahamas highlighted a leak
p113
aVfrom a nearby oil refinery.
p114
aVThe subsequent international media forced the local government
p115
aVto pledge 10 million dollars in coastal cleanups.
p116
aVThe sculpture park in Grenada was instrumental
p117
aVin the government designating a spot \u2014 a marine-protected area.
p118
aVEntrance fees to the park now help fund park rangers
p119
aVto manage tourism and fishing quotas.
p120
aVThe site was actually listed as a "Wonder of the World"
p121
aVby National Geographic.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo why are we all here today in this room?
p124
aVWhat do we all have in common?
p125
aVI think we all share a fear
p126
aVthat we don't protect our oceans enough.
p127
aVAnd one way of thinking about this
p128
aVis that we don't regard our oceans as sacred,
p129
aVand we should.
p130
aVWhen we see incredible places \u2014
p131
aVlike the Himalayas or the La Sagrada Família,
p132
aVor the Mona Lisa, even \u2014
p133
aVwhen we see these incredible places and things,
p134
aVwe understand their importance.
p135
aVWe call them sacred,
p136
aVand we do our best to cherish them, to protect them
p137
aVand to keep them safe.
p138
aVBut in order to do that,
p139
aVwe are the ones that have to assign that value;
p140
aVotherwise, it will be desecrated
p141
aVby someone who doesn't understand that value.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo I want to finish up tonight by talking about sacred things.
p144
aVWhen we were naming the site in Cancun,
p145
aVwe named it a museum for a very important and simple reason:
p146
aVmuseums are places of preservation,
p147
aVof conservation and of education.
p148
aVThey're places where we keep objects of great value to us,
p149
aVwhere we simply treasure them for them being themselves.
p150
aVIf someone was to throw an egg at the Sistine Chapel,
p151
aVwe'd all go crazy.
p152
aVIf someone wanted to build a seven-star hotel
p153
aVat the bottom of the Grand Canyon,
p154
aVthen we would laugh them out of Arizona.
p155
aVYet every day we dredge, pollute and overfish our oceans.
p156
aVAnd I think it's easier for us to do that,
p157
aVbecause when we see the ocean,
p158
aVwe don't see the havoc we're wreaking.
p159
aVBecause for most people,
p160
aVthe ocean is like this.
p161
aVAnd it's really hard
p162
aVto think of something that's just so plain and so enormous, as fragile.
p163
aVIt's simply too massive, too vast, too endless.
p164
aVAnd what do you see here?
p165
aVI think most people actually look past to the horizon.
p166
aVSo I think there's a real danger
p167
aVthat we never really see the sea,
p168
aVand if we don't really see it,
p169
aVif it doesn't have its own iconography,
p170
aVif we miss its majesty,
p171
aVthen there's a big danger that we take it for granted.
p172
aa(lp173
VCancun is famous for spring break,
p174
aVtequila and foam parties.
p175
aVAnd its waters are where frat boys can ride around on Jet Skis
p176
aVand banana boats.
p177
aVBut because of our work there, there's now a little corner of Cancun
p178
aVthat is simply precious for being itself.
p179
aVAnd we don't want to stop in Grenada,
p180
aVin Cancun or the Bahamas.
p181
aVJust last month, I installed these Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
p182
aVin the Thames River,
p183
aVin central London, right in front of the Houses of Parliament,
p184
aVputting a stark message about climate change
p185
aVin front of the people that have the power to help change things.
p186
aa(lp187
VBecause for me, this is just the beginning of the mission.
p188
aVWe want to team up with other inventors,
p189
aVcreators, philanthropists, educators, biologists,
p190
aVto see better futures for our oceans.
p191
aVAnd we want to see beyond sculpture,
p192
aVbeyond art, even.
p193
aa(lp194
VSay you're a 14-year-old kid from the city,
p195
aVand you've never seen the ocean.
p196
aVAnd instead of getting taken to the natural history museum
p197
aVor an aquarium,
p198
aVyou get taken out to the ocean,
p199
aVto an underwater Noah's Ark,
p200
aVwhich you can access through a dry-glass viewing tunnel,
p201
aVwhere you can see all the wildlife of the land
p202
aVbe colonized by the wildlife of the ocean.
p203
aVClearly, it would blow your mind.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo let's think big and let's think deep.
p206
aVWho knows where our imagination and willpower can lead us?
p207
aVI hope that by bringing our art into the ocean,
p208
aVthat not only do we take advantage of amazing creativity
p209
aVand visual impact of the setting,
p210
aVbut that we are also giving something back,
p211
aVand by encouraging new environments to thrive,
p212
aVand in some way opening up a new \u2014 or maybe it's a really old way
p213
aVof seeing the seas:
p214
aVas delicate, precious places,
p215
aVworthy of our protection.
p216
aa(lp217
VOur oceans are sacred.
p218
aa(lp219
VThank you.
