VSomeone who looks like me walks past you in the street.
p4
aVDo you think they're a mother,
p5
aVa refugee
p6
aVor a victim of oppression?
p7
aVOr do you think they're a cardiologist,
p8
aVa barrister
p9
aVor maybe your local politician?
p10
aVDo you look me up and down,
p11
aVwondering how hot I must get
p12
aVor if my husband has forced me to wear this outfit?
p13
aVWhat if I wore my scarf like this?
p14
aa(lp15
VI can walk down the street in the exact same outfit
p16
aVand what the world expects of me and the way I'm treated
p17
aVdepends on the arrangement of this piece of cloth.
p18
aVBut this isn't going to be another monologue about the hijab
p19
aVbecause Lord knows, Muslim women are so much more than the piece of cloth
p20
aVthey choose, or not, to wrap their head in.
p21
aVThis is about looking beyond your bias.
p22
aa(lp23
VWhat if I walked past you and later on
p24
aVyou'd found out that actually I was a race car engineer,
p25
aVand that I designed my own race car and I ran my university's race team,
p26
aVbecause it's true.
p27
aVWhat if I told you that I was actually trained as a boxer for five years,
p28
aVbecause that's true, too.
p29
aVWould it surprise you?
p30
aVWhy?
p31
aa(lp32
VLadies and gentlemen, ultimately,
p33
aVthat surprise and the behaviors associated with it
p34
aVare the product of something  called unconscious bias,
p35
aVor implicit prejudice.
p36
aVAnd that results in the ridiculously detrimental
p37
aVlack of diversity in our workforce,
p38
aVparticularly in areas of influence.
p39
aVHello, Australian Federal Cabinet.
p40
aV(Applause)
p41
aa(lp42
VLet me just set something out from the outset:
p43
aVUnconscious bias is not the same as conscious discrimination.
p44
aVI'm not saying that in all of you,  there's a secret sexist or racist
p45
aVor ageist lurking within,  waiting to get out.
p46
aVThat's not what I'm saying.
p47
aVWe all have our biases.
p48
aVThey're the filters through which we see the world around us.
p49
aVI'm not accusing anyone,
p50
aVbias is not an accusation.
p51
aVRather, it's something that  has to be identified,
p52
aVacknowledged and mitigated against.
p53
aVBias can be about race,
p54
aVit can be about gender.
p55
aVIt can also be about class, education, disability.
p56
aVThe fact is, we all have biases against what's different,
p57
aVwhat's different to our social norms.
p58
aa(lp59
VThe thing is, if we want  to live in a world
p60
aVwhere the circumstances of your birth
p61
aVdo not dictate your future
p62
aVand where equal opportunity is ubiquitous,
p63
aVthen each and every one of us has a role to play
p64
aVin making sure unconscious bias does not determine our lives.
p65
aa(lp66
VThere's this really famous experiment in the space of unconscious bias
p67
aVand that's in the space of gender in the 1970s and 1980s.
p68
aVSo orchestras, back in the day, were made up mostly of dudes,
p69
aVup to only five percent were female.
p70
aVAnd apparently, that was because men played it differently,
p71
aVpresumably better, presumably.
p72
aVBut in 1952, The Boston Symphony Orchestra
p73
aVstarted an experiment.
p74
aVThey started blind auditions.
p75
aVSo rather than face-to-face auditions, you would have to play behind a screen.
p76
aVNow funnily enough,
p77
aVno immediate change was registered
p78
aVuntil they asked the audition-ers to take their shoes off
p79
aVbefore they entered the room.
p80
aVbecause the clickity-clack  of the heels
p81
aVagainst the hardwood floors
p82
aVwas enough to give the ladies away.
p83
aVNow get this,
p84
aVthere results of the audition showed
p85
aVthat there was a 50 percent increased chance
p86
aVa woman would progress past the preliminary stage.
p87
aVAnd it almost tripled  their chances of getting in.
p88
aVWhat does that tell us?
p89
aVWell, unfortunately for the guys, men actually didn't play differently,
p90
aVbut there was the perception that they did.
p91
aVAnd it was that bias that was determining their outcome.
p92
aa(lp93
VSo what we're doing here  is identifying and acknowledging
p94
aVthat a bias exists.
p95
aVAnd look, we all do it.
p96
aVLet me give you an example.
p97
aVA son and his father are in  a horrible car accident.
p98
aVThe father dies on impact
p99
aVand the son, who's severely injured, is rushed to hospital.
p100
aVThe surgeon looks at the son when they arrive and is like,
p101
aV"I can't operate."
p102
aVWhy?
p103
aV"The boy is my son."
p104
aVHow can that be?
p105
aVLadies and gentlemen,
p106
aVthe surgeon is his mother.
p107
aVNow hands up \u2014 and it's okay \u2014
p108
aVbut hands up if you initially assumed the surgeon was a guy?
p109
aVThere's evidence that that unconscious bias exists,
p110
aVbut we all just have to acknowledge that it's there
p111
aVand then look at ways  that we can move past it
p112
aVso that we can look at solutions.
p113
aa(lp114
VNow one of the interesting things
p115
aVaround the space of unconscious bias is the topic of quotas.
p116
aVAnd this something  that's often brought up.
p117
aVAnd of of the criticisms  is this idea of merit.
p118
aVLook, I don't want to be picked  because I'm a chick,
p119
aVI want to be picked because  I have merit,
p120
aVbecause I'm the best person for the job.
p121
aVIt's a sentiment that's pretty common among female engineers
p122
aVthat I work with and that I know.
p123
aVAnd yeah, I get it, I've been there.
p124
aVBut, if the merit idea was true,
p125
aVwhy would identical resumes,  in an experiment done in 2012 by Yale,
p126
aVidentical resumes sent out for a lab technician,
p127
aVwhy would Jennifers be deemed less competent,
p128
aVbe less likely to be offered the job,
p129
aVand be paid less than Johns.
p130
aVThe unconscious bias is there,
p131
aVbut we just have to look at how we can move past it.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd, you know, it's interesting,
p134
aVthere's some research that talks about
p135
aVwhy this is the case and it's called the merit paradox.
p136
aVAnd in organizations \u2014 and this is kind of ironic \u2014
p137
aVin organizations that talk about merit being their primary value-driver
p138
aVin terms of who they hire,
p139
aVthey were more likely to hire dudes and more likely to pay the guys more
p140
aVbecause apparently merit  is a masculine quality.
p141
aVBut, hey.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo you guys think you've got  a good read on me,
p144
aVyou kinda think you know what's up.
p145
aVCan you imagine me running one of these?
p146
aVCan you imagine me walking in and being like,
p147
aV"Hey boys, this is what's up. This is how it's done."
p148
aVWell, I'm glad you can.
p149
aV(Applause)
p150
aVBecause ladies and gentlemen, that's my day job.
p151
aVAnd the cool thing about it is that it's pretty entertaining.
p152
aVActually, in places like Malaysia,
p153
aVMuslim women on rigs  isn't even comment-worthy.
p154
aVThere are that many of them.
p155
aVBut, it is entertaining.
p156
aa(lp157
VI remember, I was telling one of the guys,
p158
aV"Hey, mate, look, I really want  to learn how to surf."
p159
aVAnd he's like, "Yassmin, I don't know how you can surf
p160
aVwith all that gear you've got on,
p161
aVand I don't know any women-only beaches."
p162
aVAnd then, the guy came up  with a brilliant idea,
p163
aVhe was like, "I know, you run that organization
p164
aVYouth Without Borders, right?
p165
aVWhy don't you start a clothing line for Muslim chicks in beaches.
p166
aVYou can call it  Youth Without Boardshorts."
p167
aV(Laughter)
p168
aVAnd I was like, "Thanks, guys."
p169
aVAnd I remember another bloke  telling me that
p170
aVI should eat all the yogurt I could
p171
aVbecause that was the only culture  I was going to get around there.
p172
aa(lp173
VBut, the problem is, it's kind of true
p174
aVbecause there's an intense  lack of diversity in our workforce,
p175
aVparticularly in places of influence.
p176
aVNow, in 2010,
p177
aVThe Australian National University did an experiment
p178
aVwhere they sent out 4,000 identical applications
p179
aVto entry level jobs, essentially.
p180
aVTo get the same number of interviews as someone with an Anglo-Saxon name,
p181
aVif you were Chinese, you had  to send out 68 percent more applications.
p182
aVIf you were Middle Eastern \u2014 Abdel-Magied \u2014
p183
aVyou had to send out 64 percent,
p184
aVand if you're Italian,  you're pretty lucky,
p185
aVyou only have to send out 12 percent more.
p186
aVIn places like Silicon Valley, it's not that much better.
p187
aVIn Google, they put out  some diversity results
p188
aVand 61 percent white, 30 percent Asian and nine, a bunch of blacks, Hispanics,
p189
aVall that kind of thing.
p190
aVAnd the rest of the tech world is not that much better
p191
aVand they've acknowledged it,
p192
aVbut I'm not really sure what they're doing about it.
p193
aa(lp194
VThe thing is, it doesn't trickle up.
p195
aVIn a study done by Green Park,
p196
aVwho are a British senior exec supplier,
p197
aVthey said that over half of the FTSE 100 companies
p198
aVdon't have a nonwhite leader at their board level,
p199
aVexecutive or non-executive.
p200
aVAnd two out of every three don't have an executive
p201
aVwho's from a minority.
p202
aVAnd most of the minorities  that are at that sort of level
p203
aVare non-executive board directors.
p204
aVSo their influence isn't that great.
p205
aa(lp206
VI've told you a bunch of terrible things.
p207
aVYou're like, "Oh my god, how bad is that? What can I do about it?"
p208
aVWell, fortunately,
p209
aVwe've identified that there's a problem.
p210
aVThere's a lack of opportunity, and that's due to unconscious bias.
p211
aVBut you might be sitting  there thinking,
p212
aV"I ain't brown. What's that got to do with me?"
p213
aVLet me offer you a solution.
p214
aVAnd as I've said before,
p215
aVwe live in a world where we're looking for an ideal.
p216
aVAnd if we want to create a world
p217
aVwhere the circumstances of your birth don't matter,
p218
aVwe all have to be part of the solution.
p219
aVAnd interestingly, the author of the lab resume experiment
p220
aVoffered some sort of a solution.
p221
aVShe said the one thing that brought the successful women together,
p222
aVthe one thing that they had in common,
p223
aVwas the fact that they had good mentors.
p224
aa(lp225
VSo mentoring, we've all kind of heard that before,
p226
aVit's in the vernacular.
p227
aVHere's another challenge for you.
p228
aVI challenge each and every one of you to mentor someone different.
p229
aVThink about it.
p230
aVEveryone wants to mentor someone who kind of is familiar,
p231
aVwho looks like us,
p232
aVwe have shared experiences.
p233
aVIf I see a Muslim chick  who's got a bit of attitude,
p234
aVI'm like, "What's up? We can hang out."
p235
aVYou walk into a room and there's someone who went to the same school,
p236
aVyou play the same sports,
p237
aVthere's a high chance that you're going to want to help that person out.
p238
aVBut for the person in the room who has no shared experiences with you
p239
aVit becomes extremely difficult  to find that connection.
p240
aa(lp241
VThe idea of finding someone  different to mentor,
p242
aVsomeone who doesn't come from the same background as you,
p243
aVwhatever that background is,
p244
aVis about opening doors  for people who couldn't even get
p245
aVto the damn hallway.
p246
aa(lp247
VBecause ladies and gentlemen, the world is not just.
p248
aVPeople are not born  with equal opportunity.
p249
aVI was born in one of the poorest cities in the world, Khartoum.
p250
aVI was born brown, I was born female,
p251
aVand I was born Muslim in a world that is pretty suspicious of us
p252
aVfor reasons I can't control.
p253
aVHowever, I also acknowledge the fact that I was born with privilege.
p254
aVI was born with amazing parents,
p255
aVI was given an education
p256
aVand had the blessing of migrating to Australia.
p257
aVBut also, I've been blessed with amazing mentors
p258
aVwho've opened doors for me  that I didn't even know were there.
p259
aVA mentor who said to me,
p260
aV"Hey, your story's interesting.
p261
aVLet's write something about it so that I can share it with people."
p262
aVA mentor who said,
p263
aV"I know you're all those things that don't belong on an Australian rig,
p264
aVbut come on anyway."
p265
aVAnd here I am, talking to you.
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd I'm not the only one.
p268
aVThere's all sorts of people in my communities
p269
aVthat I see have been helped out by mentors.
p270
aVA young Muslim man in Sydney
p271
aVwho ended up using his mentor's help
p272
aVto start up a poetry slam in Bankstown
p273
aVand now it's a huge thing.
p274
aVAnd he's able to change the lives of so many other young people.
p275
aVOr a lady here in Brisbane,
p276
aVan Afghan lady who's a refugee,
p277
aVwho could barely speak English when she came to Australia,
p278
aVher mentors helped her become a doctor
p279
aVand she took our Young Queenslander  of the Year Award in 2008.
p280
aVShe's an inspiration.
p281
aVThis is so not smooth.
p282
aa(lp283
VThis is me.
p284
aVBut I'm also the woman in the rig clothes,
p285
aVand I'm also the woman who was in the abaya at the beginning.
p286
aVWould you have chosen to mentor me if you had seen me
p287
aVin one of those other versions of who I am?
p288
aVBecause I'm that same person.
p289
aVWe have to look past our unconscious bias,
p290
aVfind someone to mentor who's at the opposite end of your spectrum
p291
aVbecause structural change takes time,
p292
aVand I don't have that level of patience.
p293
aVSo if we're going to create a change,
p294
aVif we're going to create a world
p295
aVwhere we all have those kinds of opportunities,
p296
aVthen choose to open doors for people.
p297
aVBecause you might think that diversity has nothing to do with you,
p298
aVbut we are all part of this system
p299
aVand we can all be part of that solution.
p300
aa(lp301
VAnd if you don't know where to find someone different,
p302
aVgo to the places you wouldn't usually go.
p303
aVIf you enroll in private high school tutoring,
p304
aVgo to your local state school
p305
aVor maybe just drop into your local refugee tutoring center.
p306
aVOr perhaps you work at an office.
p307
aVTake out that new grad who looks totally out of place \u2014
p308
aV'cause that was me \u2014
p309
aVand open doors for them,
p310
aVnot in a tokenistic way, because we're not victims,
p311
aVbut show them the opportunities
p312
aVbecause opening up your world
p313
aVwill make you realize that  you have access to doors
p314
aVthat they didn't even know existed
p315
aVand you didn't even know they didn't have.
p316
aa(lp317
VLadies and gentlemen,
p318
aVthere is a problem in our community with lack of opportunity,
p319
aVespecially due to unconscious bias.
p320
aVBut each and every one one of you has the potential to change that.
p321
aVI know you've been given a lot of challenges today,
p322
aVbut if you can take this one piece and think about it a little differently,
p323
aVbecause diversity is magic.
p324
aVAnd I encourage you to look past your initial perceptions
p325
aVbecause I bet you,
p326
aVthey're probably wrong.
p327
aa(lp328
VThank you.
