VThe world is changing
p4
aVwith really remarkable speed.
p5
aVIf you look at the chart at the top here,
p6
aVyou'll see that in 2025,
p7
aVthese Goldman Sachs projections
p8
aVsuggest that the Chinese economy
p9
aVwill be almost the same size as the American economy.
p10
aVAnd if you look at the chart
p11
aVfor 2050,
p12
aVit's projected that the Chinese economy
p13
aVwill be twice the size of the American economy,
p14
aVand the Indian economy will be almost the same size
p15
aVas the American economy.
p16
aVAnd we should bear in mind here
p17
aVthat these projections were drawn up
p18
aVbefore the Western financial crisis.
p19
aa(lp20
VA couple of weeks ago,
p21
aVI was looking at the latest projection
p22
aVby BNP Paribas
p23
aVfor when China
p24
aVwill have a larger economy
p25
aVthan the United States.
p26
aVGoldman Sachs projected 2027.
p27
aVThe post-crisis projection
p28
aVis 2020.
p29
aVThat's just a decade away.
p30
aVChina is going to change the world
p31
aVin two fundamental respects.
p32
aVFirst of all,
p33
aVit's a huge developing country
p34
aVwith a population of 1.3 billion people,
p35
aVwhich has been growing for over 30 years
p36
aVat around 10 percent a year.
p37
aa(lp38
VAnd within a decade,
p39
aVit will have the largest economy in the world.
p40
aVNever before in the modern era
p41
aVhas the largest economy in the world
p42
aVbeen that of a developing country,
p43
aVrather than a developed country.
p44
aVSecondly,
p45
aVfor the first time in the modern era,
p46
aVthe dominant country in the world \u2014
p47
aVwhich I think is what China will become \u2014
p48
aVwill be not from the West
p49
aVand from very, very different civilizational roots.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow, I know it's a widespread assumption in the West
p52
aVthat as countries modernize,
p53
aVthey also westernize.
p54
aVThis is an illusion.
p55
aVIt's an assumption that modernity
p56
aVis a product simply of competition, markets and technology.
p57
aVIt is not. It is also shaped equally
p58
aVby history and culture.
p59
aVChina is not like the West,
p60
aVand it will not become like the West.
p61
aVIt will remain in very fundamental respects
p62
aVvery different.
p63
aVNow the big question here is obviously,
p64
aVhow do we make sense of China?
p65
aVHow do we try to understand what China is?
p66
aVAnd the problem we have in the West at the moment, by and large,
p67
aVis that the conventional approach
p68
aVis that we understand it really in Western terms,
p69
aVusing Western ideas.
p70
aVWe can't.
p71
aVNow I want to offer you
p72
aVthree building blocks
p73
aVfor trying to understand what China is like,
p74
aVjust as a beginning.
p75
aa(lp76
VThe first is this:
p77
aVthat China is not really a nation-state.
p78
aVOkay, it's called itself a nation-state
p79
aVfor the last hundred years,
p80
aVbut everyone who knows anything about China
p81
aVknows it's a lot older than this.
p82
aVThis was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty
p83
aVin 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period \u2014
p84
aVthe birth of modern China.
p85
aVAnd you can see it against the boundaries of modern China.
p86
aVOr immediately afterward, the Han Dynasty,
p87
aVstill 2,000 years ago.
p88
aVAnd you can see already it occupies
p89
aVmost of what we now know as Eastern China,
p90
aVwhich is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then
p91
aVand live now.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow what is extraordinary about this
p94
aVis, what gives China its sense of being China,
p95
aVwhat gives the Chinese
p96
aVthe sense of what it is to be Chinese,
p97
aVcomes not from the last hundred years,
p98
aVnot from the nation-state period,
p99
aVwhich is what happened in the West,
p100
aVbut from the period, if you like,
p101
aVof the civilization-state.
p102
aVI'm thinking here, for example,
p103
aVof customs like ancestral worship,
p104
aVof a very distinctive notion of the state,
p105
aVlikewise, a very distinctive notion of the family,
p106
aVsocial relationships like guanxi,
p107
aVConfucian values and so on.
p108
aVThese are all things that come
p109
aVfrom the period of the civilization-state.
p110
aVIn other words, China, unlike the Western states and most countries in the world,
p111
aVis shaped by its sense of civilization,
p112
aVits existence as a civilization-state,
p113
aVrather than as a nation-state.
p114
aVAnd there's one other thing to add to this, and that is this:
p115
aVOf course we know China's big, huge,
p116
aVdemographically and geographically,
p117
aVwith a population of 1.3 billion people.
p118
aVWhat we often aren't really aware of
p119
aVis the fact
p120
aVthat China is extremely diverse
p121
aVand very pluralistic,
p122
aVand in many ways very decentralized.
p123
aVYou can't run a place on this scale simply from Beijing,
p124
aVeven though we think this to be the case.
p125
aVIt's never been the case.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo this is China, a civilization-state,
p128
aVrather than a nation-state.
p129
aVAnd what does it mean?
p130
aVWell, I think it has all sorts of profound implications.
p131
aVI'll give you two quick ones.
p132
aVThe first is that
p133
aVthe most important political value for the Chinese
p134
aVis unity,
p135
aVis the maintenance
p136
aVof Chinese civilization.
p137
aVYou know, 2,000 years ago, Europe:
p138
aVbreakdown \u2014 the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire.
p139
aVIt divided, and it's remained divided ever since.
p140
aVChina, over the same time period,
p141
aVwent in exactly the opposite direction,
p142
aVvery painfully holding this huge civilization,
p143
aVcivilization-state, together.
p144
aa(lp145
VThe second
p146
aVis maybe more prosaic,
p147
aVwhich is Hong Kong.
p148
aVDo you remember the handover of Hong Kong
p149
aVby Britain to China in 1997?
p150
aVYou may remember
p151
aVwhat the Chinese constitutional proposition was.
p152
aVOne country, two systems.
p153
aVAnd I'll lay a wager
p154
aVthat barely anyone in the West believed them.
p155
aV"Window dressing.
p156
aVWhen China gets its hands on Hong Kong,
p157
aVthat won't be the case."
p158
aVThirteen years on,
p159
aVthe political and legal system in Hong Kong
p160
aVis as different now as it was in 1997.
p161
aVWe were wrong. Why were we wrong?
p162
aVWe were wrong because we thought, naturally enough,
p163
aVin nation-state ways.
p164
aVThink of German unification, 1990.
p165
aVWhat happened?
p166
aVWell, basically the East was swallowed by the West.
p167
aVOne nation, one system.
p168
aVThat is the nation-state mentality.
p169
aVBut you can't run a country like China,
p170
aVa civilization-state,
p171
aVon the basis of one civilization, one system.
p172
aVIt doesn't work.
p173
aVSo actually the response of China
p174
aVto the question of Hong Kong \u2014
p175
aVas it will be to the question of Taiwan \u2014
p176
aVwas a natural response:
p177
aVone civilization, many systems.
p178
aa(lp179
VLet me offer you another building block
p180
aVto try and understand China \u2014
p181
aVmaybe not sort of a comfortable one.
p182
aVThe Chinese have a very, very different
p183
aVconception of race
p184
aVto most other countries.
p185
aVDo you know,
p186
aVof the 1.3 billion Chinese,
p187
aVover 90 percent of them
p188
aVthink they belong to the same race,
p189
aVthe Han?
p190
aVNow, this is completely different
p191
aVfrom the world's [other] most populous countries.
p192
aVIndia, the United States,
p193
aVIndonesia, Brazil \u2014
p194
aVall of them are multiracial.
p195
aVThe Chinese don't feel like that.
p196
aVChina is only multiracial
p197
aVreally at the margins.
p198
aVSo the question is, why?
p199
aVWell the reason, I think, essentially
p200
aVis, again, back to the civilization-state.
p201
aVA history of at least 2,000 years,
p202
aVa history of conquest, occupation,
p203
aVabsorption, assimilation and so on,
p204
aVled to the process by which,
p205
aVover time, this notion of the Han emerged \u2014
p206
aVof course, nurtured
p207
aVby a growing and very powerful sense
p208
aVof cultural identity.
p209
aa(lp210
VNow the great advantage of this historical experience
p211
aVhas been that, without the Han,
p212
aVChina could never have held together.
p213
aVThe Han identity has been the cement
p214
aVwhich has held this country together.
p215
aVThe great disadvantage of it
p216
aVis that the Han have a very weak conception
p217
aVof cultural difference.
p218
aVThey really believe
p219
aVin their own superiority,
p220
aVand they are disrespectful
p221
aVof those who are not.
p222
aVHence their attitude, for example,
p223
aVto the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans.
p224
aa(lp225
VOr let me give you my third building block,
p226
aVthe Chinese state.
p227
aVNow the relationship
p228
aVbetween the state and society in China
p229
aVis very different from that in the West.
p230
aVNow we in the West
p231
aVoverwhelmingly seem to think \u2014 in these days at least \u2014
p232
aVthat the authority and legitimacy of the state
p233
aVis a function of democracy.
p234
aVThe problem with this proposition
p235
aVis that the Chinese state
p236
aVenjoys more legitimacy
p237
aVand more authority
p238
aVamongst the Chinese
p239
aVthan is true
p240
aVwith any Western state.
p241
aVAnd the reason for this
p242
aVis because \u2014
p243
aVwell, there are two reasons, I think.
p244
aVAnd it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy,
p245
aVbecause in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy.
p246
aVAnd the reason for this is,
p247
aVfirstly, because the state in China
p248
aVis given a very special \u2014
p249
aVit enjoys a very special significance
p250
aVas the representative,
p251
aVthe embodiment and the guardian
p252
aVof Chinese civilization,
p253
aVof the civilization-state.
p254
aVThis is as close as China gets
p255
aVto a kind of spiritual role.
p256
aa(lp257
VAnd the second reason is because,
p258
aVwhereas in Europe
p259
aVand North America,
p260
aVthe state's power is continuously challenged \u2014
p261
aVI mean in the European tradition,
p262
aVhistorically against the church,
p263
aVagainst other sectors of the aristocracy,
p264
aVagainst merchants and so on \u2014
p265
aVfor 1,000 years,
p266
aVthe power of the Chinese state
p267
aVhas not been challenged.
p268
aVIt's had no serious rivals.
p269
aVSo you can see
p270
aVthat the way in which power has been constructed in China
p271
aVis very different from our experience
p272
aVin Western history.
p273
aVThe result, by the way,
p274
aVis that the Chinese have a very different view of the state.
p275
aVWhereas we tend to view it as an intruder,
p276
aVa stranger,
p277
aVcertainly an organ
p278
aVwhose powers need to be limited
p279
aVor defined and constrained,
p280
aVthe Chinese don't see the state like that at all.
p281
aVThe Chinese view the state
p282
aVas an intimate \u2014 not just as an intimate actually,
p283
aVas a member of the family \u2014
p284
aVnot just in fact as a member of the family,
p285
aVbut as the head of the family,
p286
aVthe patriarch of the family.
p287
aVThis is the Chinese view of the state \u2014
p288
aVvery, very different to ours.
p289
aVIt's embedded in society in a different kind of way
p290
aVto what is the case
p291
aVin the West.
p292
aa(lp293
VAnd I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here,
p294
aVin the Chinese context,
p295
aVis a new kind of paradigm,
p296
aVwhich is different from anything
p297
aVwe've had to think about in the past.
p298
aVKnow that China believes in the market and the state.
p299
aVI mean, Adam Smith,
p300
aValready writing in the late 18th century, said,
p301
aV"The Chinese market is larger and more developed
p302
aVand more sophisticated
p303
aVthan anything in Europe."
p304
aVAnd, apart from the Mao period,
p305
aVthat has remained more or less the case ever since.
p306
aVBut this is combined
p307
aVwith an extremely strong and ubiquitous state.
p308
aVThe state is everywhere in China.
p309
aVI mean, it's leading firms \u2014
p310
aVmany of them are still publicly owned.
p311
aVPrivate firms, however large they are, like Lenovo,
p312
aVdepend in many ways on state patronage.
p313
aVTargets for the economy and so on
p314
aVare set by the state.
p315
aVAnd the state, of course, its authority flows into lots of other areas \u2014
p316
aVas we are familiar with \u2014
p317
aVwith something like the one-child policy.
p318
aa(lp319
VMoreover, this is a very old state tradition,
p320
aVa very old tradition of statecraft.
p321
aVI mean, if you want an illustration of this,
p322
aVthe Great Wall is one.
p323
aVBut this is another, this is the Grand Canal,
p324
aVwhich was constructed in the first instance
p325
aVin the fifth century B.C.
p326
aVand was finally completed
p327
aVin the seventh century A.D.
p328
aVIt went for 1,114 miles,
p329
aVlinking Beijing
p330
aVwith Hangzhou and Shanghai.
p331
aVSo there's a long history
p332
aVof extraordinary state infrastructural projects
p333
aVin China,
p334
aVwhich I suppose helps us to explain what we see today,
p335
aVwhich is something like the Three Gorges Dam
p336
aVand many other expressions
p337
aVof state competence
p338
aVwithin China.
p339
aVSo there we have three building blocks
p340
aVfor trying to understand the difference that is China \u2014
p341
aVthe civilization-state,
p342
aVthe notion of race
p343
aVand the nature of the state
p344
aVand its relationship to society.
p345
aa(lp346
VAnd yet we still insist, by and large,
p347
aVin thinking that we can understand China
p348
aVby simply drawing on Western experience,
p349
aVlooking at it through Western eyes,
p350
aVusing Western concepts.
p351
aVIf you want to know why
p352
aVwe unerringly seem to get China wrong \u2014
p353
aVour predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect \u2014
p354
aVthis is the reason.
p355
aVUnfortunately, I think,
p356
aVI have to say that I think
p357
aVattitude towards China
p358
aVis that of a kind of little Westerner mentality.
p359
aVIt's kind of arrogant.
p360
aVIt's arrogant in the sense
p361
aVthat we think that we are best,
p362
aVand therefore we have the universal measure.
p363
aVAnd secondly, it's ignorant.
p364
aVWe refuse to really address
p365
aVthe issue of difference.
p366
aVYou know, there's a very interesting passage
p367
aVin a book by Paul Cohen, the American historian.
p368
aVAnd Paul Cohen argues
p369
aVthat the West thinks of itself
p370
aVas probably the most cosmopolitan
p371
aVof all cultures.
p372
aVBut it's not.
p373
aVIn many ways,
p374
aVit's the most parochial,
p375
aVbecause for 200 years,
p376
aVthe West has been so dominant in the world
p377
aVthat it's not really needed
p378
aVto understand other cultures,
p379
aVother civilizations.
p380
aVBecause, at the end of the day,
p381
aVit could, if necessary by force,
p382
aVget its own way.
p383
aVWhereas those cultures \u2014
p384
aVvirtually the rest of the world, in fact,
p385
aVwhich have been in a far weaker position, vis-a-vis the West \u2014
p386
aVhave been thereby forced to understand the West,
p387
aVbecause of the West's presence in those societies.
p388
aVAnd therefore, they are, as a result,
p389
aVmore cosmopolitan in many ways than the West.
p390
aa(lp391
VI mean, take the question of East Asia.
p392
aVEast Asia: Japan, Korea, China, etc. \u2014
p393
aVa third of the world's population lives there.
p394
aVNow the largest economic region in the world.
p395
aVAnd I'll tell you now,
p396
aVthat East Asianers, people from East Asia,
p397
aVare far more knowledgeable
p398
aVabout the West
p399
aVthan the West is about East Asia.
p400
aVNow this point is very germane, I'm afraid,
p401
aVto the present.
p402
aVBecause what's happening? Back to that chart at the beginning,
p403
aVthe Goldman Sachs chart.
p404
aVWhat is happening
p405
aVis that, very rapidly in historical terms,
p406
aVthe world is being driven
p407
aVand shaped,
p408
aVnot by the old developed countries,
p409
aVbut by the developing world.
p410
aVWe've seen this
p411
aVin terms of the G20
p412
aVusurping very rapidly the position of the G7,
p413
aVor the G8.
p414
aVAnd there are two consequences of this.
p415
aVFirst, the West
p416
aVis rapidly losing
p417
aVits influence in the world.
p418
aVThere was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago \u2014
p419
aVCopenhagen, climate change conference.
p420
aVEurope was not at the final negotiating table.
p421
aVWhen did that last happen?
p422
aVI would wager it was probably about 200 years ago.
p423
aVAnd that is what is going to happen in the future.
p424
aa(lp425
VAnd the second implication
p426
aVis that the world will inevitably, as a consequence,
p427
aVbecome increasingly unfamiliar to us,
p428
aVbecause it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories
p429
aVthat we are not really familiar with,
p430
aVor conversant with.
p431
aVAnd at last, I'm afraid \u2014 take Europe;
p432
aVAmerica is slightly different \u2014
p433
aVbut Europeans by and large, I have to say,
p434
aVare ignorant,
p435
aVare unaware
p436
aVabout the way the world is changing.
p437
aVSome people \u2014 I've got an English friend in China,
p438
aVand he said, "The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion."
p439
aVWell, maybe that's true,
p440
aVmaybe that's an exaggeration.
p441
aVBut there's another problem which goes along with this \u2014
p442
aVthat Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world \u2014
p443
aVand that is a sort of
p444
aVloss of a sense of the future.
p445
aVI mean, Europe once, of course, once commanded the future
p446
aVin its confidence.
p447
aVTake the 19th century, for example.
p448
aVBut this, alas, is no longer true.
p449
aa(lp450
VIf you want to feel the future, if you want to taste the future,
p451
aVtry China \u2014 there's old Confucius.
p452
aVThis is a railway station
p453
aVthe likes of which you've never seen before.
p454
aVIt doesn't even look like a railway station.
p455
aVThis is the new [Wuhan] railway station
p456
aVfor the high-speed trains.
p457
aVChina already has a bigger network
p458
aVthan any other country in the world
p459
aVand will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together.
p460
aVOr take this: now this is an idea,
p461
aVbut it's an idea to be tried out shortly
p462
aVin a suburb of Beijing.
p463
aVHere you have a megabus,
p464
aVon the upper deck carries about 2,000 people.
p465
aVIt travels on rails
p466
aVdown a suburban road,
p467
aVand the cars travel underneath it.
p468
aVAnd it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour.
p469
aVNow this is the way things are going to move,
p470
aVbecause China has a very specific problem,
p471
aVwhich is different from Europe
p472
aVand different from the United States:
p473
aVChina has huge numbers of people and no space.
p474
aVSo this is a solution to a situation
p475
aVwhere China's going to have
p476
aVmany, many, many cities
p477
aVover 20 million people.
p478
aa(lp479
VOkay, so how would I like to finish?
p480
aVWell, what should our attitude be
