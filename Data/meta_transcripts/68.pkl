VI've got apparently 18 minutes
p4
aVto convince you that history has a direction, an arrow;
p5
aVthat in some fundamental sense, it's good;
p6
aVthat the arrow points to something positive.
p7
aVNow, when the TED people first approached me about giving this upbeat talk \u2014
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aV\u2014 that was before the cartoon of Muhammad had triggered global rioting.
p10
aVIt was before the avian flu had reached Europe.
p11
aVIt was before Hamas had won the Palestinian election,
p12
aVeliciting various counter-measures by Israel.
p13
aVAnd to be honest, if I had known when I was asked to give this upbeat talk
p14
aVthat even as I was giving the upbeat talk,
p15
aVthe apocalypse would be unfolding \u2014
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aV\u2014 I might have said, "Is it okay if I talk about something else?"
p18
aVBut I didn't, OK. So we're here. I'll do what I can. I'll do what I can.
p19
aa(lp20
VI've got to warn you:
p21
aVthe sense in which my worldview is upbeat has always been kind of subtle,
p22
aVsometimes even elusive.
p23
aV(Laughter)
p24
aVThe sense in which I can be uplifting and inspiring \u2014
p25
aVI mean, there's always been a kind of a certain grim dimension
p26
aVto the way I try to uplift, so if grim inspiration \u2014
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aV\u2014 if grim inspiration is not a contradiction in terms, that is, I'm afraid,
p29
aVthe most you can hope for. OK, today \u2014 that's if I succeed.
p30
aVI'll see what I can do. OK?
p31
aa(lp32
VNow, in one sense,
p33
aVthe claim that history has a direction is not that controversial.
p34
aVIf you're just talking about social structure,
p35
aVOK, clearly that's gotten more complex
p36
aVa little over the last 10,000 years \u2014 has reached higher and higher levels.
p37
aVAnd in fact, that's actually sustaining
p38
aVa long-standing trend that predates human beings, OK,
p39
aVthat biological evolution was doing for us.
p40
aVBecause what happened in the beginning, this stuff encases itself in a cell,
p41
aVthen cells start hanging out together in societies.
p42
aVEventually they get so close, they form multicellular organisms,
p43
aVthen you get complex multicellular organisms; they form societies.
p44
aa(lp45
VBut then at some point, one of these multicellular organisms
p46
aVdoes something completely amazing with this stuff, which is
p47
aVit launches a whole second kind of evolution: cultural evolution.
p48
aVAnd amazingly, that evolution sustains the trajectory
p49
aVthat biological evolution had established toward greater complexity.
p50
aVBy cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas.
p51
aVA lot of you have heard the term "memes." The evolution of technology,
p52
aVI pay a lot of attention to, so, you know,
p53
aVone of the first things you got was a little hand axe.
p54
aVGenerations go by, somebody says, hey, why don't we put it on a stick?
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aVJust absolutely delights the little ones.
p57
aVNext best thing to a video game.
p58
aa(lp59
VThis may not seem to impress,
p60
aVbut technological evolution is progressive, so another 10, 20,000 years,
p61
aVand armaments technology takes you here.
p62
aV(Laughter)
p63
aVImpressive. And the rate of technological evolution speeds up,
p64
aVso a mere quarter of a century after this, you get this, OK.
p65
aV(Laughter)
p66
aVAnd this.
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aVI'm sorry \u2014 it was a cheap laugh, but I wanted to find a way
p69
aVto transition back to this idea of the unfolding apocalypse,
p70
aVand I thought that might do it.
p71
aV(Applause)
p72
aa(lp73
VSo, what threatens to happen with this unfolding apocalypse
p74
aVis the collapse of global social organization.
p75
aVNow, first let me remind you how much work it took to get us where we are,
p76
aVto be on the brink of true global social organization.
p77
aVOriginally, you had the most complex societies, the hunter-gatherer village.
p78
aVStonehenge is the remnant of a chiefdom,
p79
aVwhich is what you get with the invention of agriculture: multi-village polity
p80
aVwith centralized rule.
p81
aVWith the invention of writing, you start getting cities. This is blurry. I kind of like that
p82
aVbecause it makes it look like a one-celled organism and reminds you
p83
aVhow many levels organic organization has already moved through
p84
aVto get to this point. And then you get to, you know, you get empires.
p85
aa(lp86
VI want to stress, you know, social organization can transcend political bounds.
p87
aVThis is the Silk Road connecting the Chinese Empire and the Roman Empire.
p88
aVSo you had social complexity spanning the whole continent,
p89
aVeven if no polity did similarly. Today, you've got nation states.
p90
aVPoint is: there's obviously collaboration and organization going on
p91
aVbeyond national bounds.
p92
aVThis is actually just a picture of the earth at night,
p93
aVand I'm just putting it up because I think it's pretty.
p94
aVDoes kind of convey the sense that this is an integrated system.
p95
aa(lp96
VNow, I explained this growth of complexity by reference to something
p97
aVcalled "non-zero sumness."
p98
aVAssuming that a few of you did not do the assigned reading, very quickly,
p99
aVthe key idea is the distinction between zero-sum games, in which correlations
p100
aVare inverse: always a winner and a loser.
p101
aVNon-zero-sum games in which correlations can be positive, OK.
p102
aVSo like in tennis, usually it's win-lose;
p103
aVit always adds up to zero-zero-sum. But if you're playing doubles,
p104
aVthe person on your side of the net, they're in the same boat as you,
p105
aVso you're playing a non-zero-sum game with them.
p106
aVIt's either for the better or for the worse, OK.
p107
aVA lot of forms of non-zero-sum behavior in the realm of economics and so on
p108
aVin everyday life often leads to cooperation.
p109
aa(lp110
VThe argument I make is basically that, well,
p111
aVnon-zero-sum games have always been part of life.
p112
aVYou have them in hunter-gatherer societies,
p113
aVbut then through technological evolution, new forms of technology arise
p114
aVthat facilitate or encourage the playing of non-zero-sum games,
p115
aVinvolving more people over larger territory.
p116
aVSocial structure adapts to accommodate this possibility and
p117
aVto harness this productive potential, so you get cities, you know,
p118
aVand you get all the non-zero-sum games you don't think about
p119
aVthat are being played across the world.
p120
aVLike, have you ever thought when you buy a car,
p121
aVhow many people on how many different continents contributed
p122
aVto the manufacture of that car? Those are people in effect
p123
aVyou're playing a non-zero-sum game with.
p124
aVI mean, there are certainly plenty of them around.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow, this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way,
p127
aVbecause when you think of non-zero, you think win-win, you know,
p128
aVthat's good. Well, there are a few reasons
p129
aVthat actually it's not intrinsically upbeat.
p130
aVFirst of all, it can accommodate; it doesn't deny the existence
p131
aVof inequality exploitation war.
p132
aVBut there's a more fundamental reason
p133
aVthat it's not intrinsically upbeat, because a non-zero-sum game,
p134
aVall it tells you for sure is that the fortunes will be correlated for better or worse.
p135
aVIt doesn't necessarily predict a win-win outcome.
p136
aa(lp137
VSo, in a way, the question is: on what grounds
p138
aVam I upbeat at all about history? And the answer is,
p139
aVfirst of all, on balance I would say people have played their games
p140
aVto more win-win outcomes than lose-lose outcomes. On balance,
p141
aVI think history is a net positive in the non-zero-sum game department.
p142
aVAnd a testament to this is the thing that most amazes me,
p143
aVmost impresses me, and most uplifts me,
p144
aVwhich is that there is a moral dimension to history;
p145
aVthere is a moral arrow. We have seen moral progress over time.
p146
aa(lp147
V2,500 years ago, members of one Greek city-state
p148
aVconsidered members of another Greek city-state subhuman
p149
aVand treated them that way. And then this moral revolution arrived,
p150
aVand they decided that actually, no, Greeks are human beings.
p151
aVIt's just the Persians who aren't fully human
p152
aVand don't deserve to be treated very nicely.
p153
aa(lp154
VBut this was progress \u2014 you know, give them credit. And now today,
p155
aVwe've seen more progress. I think \u2014 I hope \u2014 most people here would say
p156
aVthat all people everywhere are human beings,
p157
aVdeserve to be treated decently,
p158
aVunless they do something horrendous, regardless of race or religion.
p159
aVAnd you have to read your ancient history to realize what a revolution that has been,
p160
aVOK. This was not a prevalent view,
p161
aVfew thousand years ago, and I attribute it to this non-zero-sum dynamic.
p162
aVI think that's the reason there is as much tolerance toward nationalities,
p163
aVethnicities, religions as there is today. If you asked me,
p164
aVyou know, why am I not in favor of bombing Japan,
p165
aVwell, I'm only half-joking when I say they built my car.
p166
aVWe have this non-zero-sum relationship,
p167
aVand I think that does lead to a kind of a tolerance to the extent that you realize
p168
aVthat someone else's welfare is positively correlated with yours \u2014
p169
aVyou're more likely to cut them a break.
p170
aa(lp171
VI kind of think this is a kind of a business-class morality.
p172
aVUnfortunately, I don't fly trans-Atlantic business class often enough
p173
aVto know, or any other kind of business class really,
p174
aVbut I assume that in business class, you don't hear many expressions of, you know,
p175
aVbigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups,
p176
aVbecause the people who are flying trans-Atlantic business class
p177
aVare doing business with all these people; they're making money
p178
aVoff all these people. And I really do think that, in that sense at least,
p179
aVcapitalism has been a constructive force,
p180
aVand more fundamentally, it's a non-zero-sumness
p181
aVthat has been a constructive force in expanding people's realm
p182
aVof moral awareness. I think the non-zero-sum dynamic,
p183
aVwhich is not only economic by any means \u2014 it's not always commerce \u2014
p184
aVbut it has driven us to the verge of a moral truth,
p185
aVwhich is the fundamental equality of everyone. It has done that.
p186
aVAs it has moved global, moved us toward a global level of social organization,
p187
aVit has driven us toward moral truth.
p188
aVI think that's wonderful.
p189
aa(lp190
VNow, back to the unfolding apocalypse.
p191
aVAnd you may wonder, OK, that's all fine,
p192
aVsounds great \u2014 moral direction in history \u2014
p193
aVbut what about this so-called clash of civilizations? Well, first of all,
p194
aVI would emphasize that it fits into the non-zero-sum framework,
p195
aVOK. If you look at the relationship
p196
aVbetween the so-called Muslim world and Western world \u2014
p197
aVtwo terms I don't like, but can't really avoid;
p198
aVin such a short span of time, they're efficient if nothing else \u2014
p199
aVit is non-zero-sum. And by that I mean,
p200
aVif people in the Muslim world get more hateful, more resentful,
p201
aVless happy with their place in the world,
p202
aVit'll be bad for the West. If they get more happy, it'll be good for the West.
p203
aVSo that is a non-zero-sum dynamic.
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd I would say the non-zero-sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time
p206
aVbecause of technological trends, but more intense in a kind of negative way.
p207
aVIt's the downside correlation of their fortunes that will become more and more possible.
p208
aVAnd one reason is because of something I call the "growing lethality of hatred."
p209
aVMore and more, it's possible for grassroots hatred abroad
p210
aVto manifest itself in the form of organized violence on American soil.
p211
aVAnd that's pretty new, and I think it's probably going to get a lot worse
p212
aV\u2014 this capacity \u2014 because of
p213
aVtrends in information technology, in technologies that can be used
p214
aVfor purposes of munitions like biotechnology and nanotechnology.
p215
aVWe may be hearing more about that today.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd there's something I worry about especially, which is that
p218
aVthis dynamic will lead to a kind of a feedback cycle that puts us on a slippery slope.
p219
aVWhat I have in mind is: terrorism happens here; we overreact to it.
p220
aVThat, you know, we're not sufficiently surgical in our retaliation
p221
aVleads to more hatred abroad, more terrorism.
p222
aVWe overreact because being human, we feel like retaliating,
p223
aVand it gets worse and worse and worse.
p224
aVYou could call this the positive feedback of negative vibes,
p225
aVbut I think in something so spooky,
p226
aVwe really shouldn't have the word positive there at all, even in a technical sense.
p227
aVSo let's call it the death spiral of negativity.
p228
aV(Laughter)
p229
aVI assure you if it happens, at the end, both the West
p230
aVand the Muslim world will have suffered.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo, what do we do? Well, first of all, we can do a lot more with arms control,
p233
aVthe international regulation of dangerous technologies.
p234
aVI have a whole global governance sermon
p235
aVthat I will spare you right now,
p236
aVbecause I don't think that's going to be enough anyway, although it's essential.
p237
aVI think we're going to have to have a major round
p238
aVof moral progress in the world.
p239
aVI think you're just going to have to see less hatred among groups,
p240
aVless bigotry, and, you know, racial groups, religious groups, whatever.
p241
aVI've got to admit I feel silly saying that.
p242
aVIt sounds so kind of Pollyannaish. I feel like Rodney King, you know,
p243
aVsaying, why can't we all just get along?
p244
aVBut hey, I don't really see any alternative, given the way I read the situation.
p245
aVThere's going to have to be moral progress.
p246
aVThere's going to have to be a lessening of the amount of hatred in the world,
p247
aVgiven how dangerous it's becoming.
p248
aVIn my defense, I'd say, as naive as this may sound,
p249
aVit's ultimately grounded in cynicism.
p250
aa(lp251
VThat is to say \u2014
p252
aV(Laughter)
p253
aV\u2014 thank you, thank you. That is to say, remember: my whole view
p254
aVof morality is that it boils down to self-interest.
p255
aVIt's when people's fortunes are correlated.
p256
aVIt's when your welfare conduces to mine, that I decide, oh yeah,
p257
aVI'm all in favor of your welfare. That's what's responsible
p258
aVfor this growth of this moral progress so far,
p259
aVand I'm saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes,
p260
aVand if people respond to it intelligently, we will see
p261
aVthe development of tolerance and so on \u2014
p262
aVthe norms that we need, you know.
p263
aVWe will see the further evolution of this kind of business-class morality.
p264
aa(lp265
VSo, these two things, you know, if they get people's attention
p266
aVand drive home the positive correlation and people do what's in their self-interests,
p267
aVwhich is further the moral evolution,
p268
aVthen they could actually have a constructive effect.
p269
aVAnd that's why I lump growing lethality of hatred
p270
aVand death spiral of negativity under the general rubric,
p271
aVreasons to be cheerful.
p272
aV(Laughter)
p273
aVDoing the best I can, OK.
p274
aV(Laughter)
p275
aVI never called myself Mr. Uplift.
p276
aVI'm just doing what I can here.
p277
aV(Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VNow, launching a moral revolution has got to be hard, right?
p280
aVI mean, what do you do?
p281
aVAnd I think the answer is a lot of different people
p282
aVare going to have to do a lot of different things.
p283
aVWe all start where we are. Speaking as an American
p284
aVwho has children whose security 10, 20, 30 years down the road
p285
aVI worry about \u2014 what I personally want to start out doing
p286
aVis figuring out why so many people around the world hate us, OK.
p287
aVI think that's a worthy research project myself.
p288
aVI also like it because it's an intrinsically kind of morally redeeming exercise.
p289
aVBecause to understand why somebody
p290
aVin a very different culture does something \u2014
p291
aVsomebody you're kind of viewing as alien,
p292
aVwho's doing things you consider strange
p293
aVin a culture you consider strange \u2014 to really understand why they do
p294
aVthe things they do is a morally redeeming accomplishment,
p295
aVbecause you've got to relate their experience to yours.
p296
aVTo really understand it, you've got to say, "Oh, I get it.
p297
aVSo when they feel resentful, it's kind of like
p298
aVthe way I feel resentful when this happens,
p299
aVand for somewhat the same reasons." That's true understanding.
p300
aVAnd I think that is an expansion of your moral compass when you manage to do that.
p301
aa(lp302
VIt's especially hard to do when people hate you, OK,
p303
aVbecause you don't really, in a sense, want
p304
aVto completely understand why people hate you.
p305
aVI mean, you want to hear the reason, but you don't want to be able to relate to it.
p306
aVYou don't want it to make sense, right? (Laughter)
p307
aVYou don't want to say, "Well, yeah, I can kind of understand
p308
aVhow a human being in those circumstances
p309
aVwould hate the country I live in." That's not a pleasant thing,
p310
aVbut I think it's something that we're going to have to get used to and
p311
aa(lp312
Vwork on. Now, I want to stress that to understand, you know \u2014
p313
aVthere are people who don't like this whole business of understanding
p314
aVthe grassroots, the root causes of things; they don't want to know
p315
aVwhy people hate us. I want to understand it.
p316
aVThe reason you're trying to understand why they hate us,
p317
aVis to get them to quit hating us. The idea
p318
aVwhen you go through this moral exercise of really coming to appreciate
p319
aVtheir humanity and better understand them, is part of an effort
p320
aVto get them to appreciate your humanity in the long run.
p321
aVI think it's the first step toward that. That's the long-term goal.
p322
aa(lp323
VThere are people who worry about this, and in fact,
p324
aVI, myself, apparently, was denounced on national TV
p325
aVa couple of nights ago because of an op-ed I'd written.
p326
aVIt was kind of along these lines, and the allegation was
p327
aVthat I have, quote, "affection for terrorists."
p328
aVNow, the good news is that the person who said it was Ann Coulter.
p329
aV(Laughter)
p330
aV(Applause)
p331
aVI mean, if you've got to have an enemy, do make it Ann Coulter.
p332
aV(Laughter)
p333
aVBut it's not a crazy concern, OK, because understanding behavior
p334
aVcan lead to a kind of empathy,
p335
aVand it can make it a little harder to deliver tough love, and so on.
p336
aVBut I think we're a lot closer to erring on the side of not comprehending
p337
aVthe situation clearly enough, than in comprehending it so clearly
p338
aVthat we just can't, you know, get the army out to kill terrorists.
p339
aa(lp340
VSo I'm not really worried about it. So \u2014
p341
aV(Laughter)
p342
aV\u2014 I mean, we're going to have to work on a lot of fronts,
p343
aVbut if we succeed \u2014 if we succeed \u2014 then once again,
p344
aVnon-zero-sumness and the recognition of non-zero-sum dynamics
p345
aVwill have forced us to a higher moral level.
p346
aVAnd a kind of saving higher moral level,
p347
aVsomething that kind of literally saves the world.
p348
aVIf you look at the word "salvation" in the Bible \u2014
p349
aVthe Christian usage that we're familiar with \u2014
p350
aVsaving souls, that people go to heaven \u2014 that's actually a latecomer.
p351
aVThe original meaning of the word "salvation" in the Bible is about saving the social system.
p352
aV"Yahweh is our Savior" means "He has saved the nation of Israel,"
p353
aVwhich at the time, was a pretty high-level social organization.
p354
aa(lp355
VNow, social organization has reached the global level, and I guess,
p356
aVif there's good news I can say I'm bringing you, it's just that
p357
aVall the salvation of the world requires is the intelligent pursuit
p358
aVof self-interests in a disciplined and careful way.
p359
aVIt's going to be hard. I say we give it a shot anyway
p360
aVbecause we've just come too far to screw it up now.
p361
aVThanks.
