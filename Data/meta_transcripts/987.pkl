VSo yeah, I'm a newspaper cartoonist \u2014
p4
aVpolitical cartoonist.
p5
aVI don't know if you've heard about it \u2014 newspapers?
p6
aVIt's a sort of paper-based reader.
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aVIt's lighter than an iPad,
p9
aVit's a bit cheaper.
p10
aVYou know what they say?
p11
aVThey say the print media is dying \u2014
p12
aVwho says that? Well, the media.
p13
aVBut this is no news, right?
p14
aVYou've read about it already.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VLadies and gentlemen,
p19
aVthe world has gotten smaller.
p20
aVI know it's a cliche, but look,
p21
aVlook how small,
p22
aVhow tiny it has gotten.
p23
aVAnd you know the reason why, of course.
p24
aVThis is because of technology \u2014 yeah.
p25
aV(Laughter)
p26
aVAny computer designers in the room?
p27
aVYeah well,
p28
aVyou guys are making my life miserable
p29
aVbecause track pads used to be round,
p30
aVa nice round shape.
p31
aVThat makes a good cartoon.
p32
aVBut what are you going to do with a flat track pad,
p33
aVthose square things?
p34
aVThere's nothing I can do as a cartoonist.
p35
aVWell, I know the world is flat now.
p36
aVThat's true.
p37
aVAnd the Internet has reached
p38
aVevery corner of the world,
p39
aVthe poorest, the remotest places.
p40
aVEvery village in Africa now has a cyber cafe.
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aVDon't go asking for a Frappuccino there.
p43
aVSo we are bridging the digital divide.
p44
aVThe Third World is connected,
p45
aVwe are connected.
p46
aVAnd what happens next?
p47
aVWell, you've got mail.
p48
aVYeah.
p49
aVWell, the Internet has empowered us.
p50
aVIt has empowered you,
p51
aVit has empowered me
p52
aVand it has empowered some other guys as well.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VYou know, these last two cartoons \u2014
p57
aVI did them live
p58
aVduring a conference in Hanoi.
p59
aVAnd they were not used to that
p60
aVin communist 2.0 Vietnam.
p61
aV(Laughter)
p62
aVSo I was cartooning live on a wide screen \u2014
p63
aVit was quite a sensation \u2014
p64
aVand then this guy came to me.
p65
aVHe was taking pictures of me and of my sketches,
p66
aVand I thought, "This is great, a Vietnamese fan."
p67
aVAnd as he came the second day,
p68
aVI thought, "Wow, that's really a cartoon lover."
p69
aVAnd on the third day, I finally understood,
p70
aVthe guy was actually on duty.
p71
aVSo by now, there must be a hundred pictures of me
p72
aVsmiling with my sketches
p73
aVin the files of the Vietnamese police.
p74
aa(lp75
V(Laughter)
p76
aa(lp77
VNo, but it's true: the Internet has changed the world.
p78
aVIt has rocked the music industry;
p79
aVit has changed the way we consume music.
p80
aVFor those of you old enough to remember,
p81
aVwe used to have to go to the store
p82
aVto steal it.
p83
aV(Laughter)
p84
aVAnd it has changed the way
p85
aVyour future employer
p86
aVwill look at your application.
p87
aVSo be careful
p88
aVwith that Facebook account \u2014
p89
aVyour momma told you, be careful.
p90
aVAnd technology has set us free \u2014
p91
aVthis is free WiFi.
p92
aVBut yeah, it has liberated us
p93
aVfrom the office desk.
p94
aVThis is your life,
p95
aVenjoy it.
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVIn short, technology, the internet,
p98
aVthey have changed our lifestyle.
p99
aVTech guru, like this man \u2014
p100
aVthat a German magazine called the philosopher of the 21st century \u2014
p101
aVthey are shaping the way we do things.
p102
aVThey are shaping the way we consume.
p103
aVThey are shaping our very desires.
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aV(Applause)
p106
aVYou will not like it.
p107
aVAnd technology has even changed
p108
aVour relationship to God.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VNow I shouldn't get into this.
p113
aVReligion and political cartoons,
p114
aVas you may have heard,
p115
aVmake a difficult couple,
p116
aVever since that day of 2005,
p117
aVwhen a bunch of cartoonists in Denmark
p118
aVdrew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world \u2014
p119
aVdemonstrations, fatwa,
p120
aVthey provoked violence. People died in the violence.
p121
aVThis was so sickening;
p122
aVpeople died because of cartoons.
p123
aVI mean \u2014
p124
aVI had the feeling at the time
p125
aVthat cartoons had been used by both sides, actually.
p126
aVThey were used first by a Danish newspaper,
p127
aVwhich wanted to make a point on Islam.
p128
aVA Danish cartoonist told me he was one of the 24
p129
aVwho received the assignment to draw the prophet \u2014
p130
aV12 of them refused. Did you know that?
p131
aVHe told me, "Nobody has to tell me what I should draw.
p132
aVThis is not how it works."
p133
aVAnd then, of course, they were used
p134
aVby extremists and politicians on the other side.
p135
aVThey wanted to stir up controversy.
p136
aVYou know the story.
p137
aVWe know that cartoons can be used as weapons.
p138
aVHistory tells us,
p139
aVthey've been used by the Nazis
p140
aVto attack the Jews.
p141
aVAnd here we are now.
p142
aVIn the United Nations,
p143
aVhalf of the world is pushing
p144
aVto penalize the offense to religion \u2014
p145
aVthey call it the defamation of religion \u2014
p146
aVwhile the other half of the world is fighting back
p147
aVin defense of freedom of speech.
p148
aVSo the clash of civilizations is here,
p149
aVand cartoons are at the middle of it?
p150
aVThis got me thinking.
p151
aVNow you see me thinking
p152
aVat my kitchen table,
p153
aVand since you're in my kitchen,
p154
aVplease meet my wife.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VIn 2006, a few months after,
p159
aVI went Ivory Coast \u2014
p160
aVWestern Africa.
p161
aVNow, talk of a divided place \u2014 the country was cut in two.
p162
aVYou had a rebellion in the North,
p163
aVthe government in the South \u2014 the capital, Abidjan \u2014
p164
aVand in the middle, the French army.
p165
aVThis looks like a giant hamburger.
p166
aVYou don't want to be the ham in the middle.
p167
aVI was there to report on that story
p168
aVin cartoons.
p169
aVI've been doing this for the last 15 years;
p170
aVit's my side job, if you want.
p171
aVSo you see the style is different.
p172
aVThis is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning.
p173
aVI went to places like Gaza
p174
aVduring the war in 2009.
p175
aVSo this is really journalism in cartoons.
p176
aVYou'll hear more and more about it.
p177
aVThis is the future of journalism, I think.
p178
aa(lp179
VAnd of course, I went to see the rebels in the north.
p180
aVThose were poor guys fighting for their rights.
p181
aVThere was an ethnic side to this conflict
p182
aVas very often in Africa.
p183
aVAnd I went to see the Dozo.
p184
aVThe Dozo, they are the traditional hunters
p185
aVof West Africa.
p186
aVPeople fear them \u2014
p187
aVthey help the rebellion a lot.
p188
aVThey are believed to have magical powers.
p189
aVThey can disappear and escape bullets.
p190
aVI went to see a Dozo chief;
p191
aVhe told me about his magical powers.
p192
aVHe said, "I can chop your head off right away
p193
aVand bring you back to life."
p194
aVI said, "Well, maybe we don't have time for this right now."
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aV"Another time."
p197
aa(lp198
VSo back in Abidjan,
p199
aVI was given a chance to lead a workshop
p200
aVwith local cartoonists there
p201
aVand I thought, yes,
p202
aVin a context like this, cartoons can really be used as weapons
p203
aVagainst the other side.
p204
aVI mean, the press in Ivory Coast was bitterly divided \u2014
p205
aVit was compared to the media in Rwanda
p206
aVbefore the genocide \u2014
p207
aVso imagine.
p208
aVAnd what can a cartoonist do?
p209
aVSometimes editors would tell their cartoonists
p210
aVto draw what they wanted to see,
p211
aVand the guy has to feed his family, right?
p212
aVSo the idea was pretty simple.
p213
aVWe brought together cartoonists
p214
aVfrom all sides in Ivory Coast.
p215
aVWe took them away from their newspaper for three days.
p216
aVAnd I asked them to do a project together,
p217
aVtackle the issues affecting their country
p218
aVin cartoons, yes, in cartoons.
p219
aVShow the positive power of cartoons.
p220
aVIt's a great tool of communication
p221
aVfor bad or for good.
p222
aVAnd cartoons can cross boundaries,
p223
aVas you have seen.
p224
aVAnd humor is a good way, I think,
p225
aVto address serious issues.
p226
aVAnd I'm very proud of what they did.
p227
aVI mean, they didn't agree with each other \u2014 that was not the point.
p228
aVAnd I didn't ask them to do nice cartoons.
p229
aVThe first day, they were even shouting at each other.
p230
aVBut they came up with a book,
p231
aVlooking back at 13 years
p232
aVof political crisis in Ivory Coast.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo the idea was there.
p235
aVAnd I've been doing projects like this,
p236
aVin 2009 in Lebanon,
p237
aVthis year in Kenya, back in January.
p238
aVIn Lebanon, it was not a book.
p239
aVThe idea was to have \u2014
p240
aVthe same principal, a divided country \u2014
p241
aVtake cartoonists from all sides
p242
aVand let them do something together.
p243
aVSo in Lebanon,
p244
aVwe enrolled the newspaper editors,
p245
aVand we got them to publish
p246
aVeight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page,
p247
aVaddressing the issue affecting Lebanon,
p248
aVlike religion in politics and everyday life.
p249
aVAnd it worked.
p250
aVFor three days, almost all the newspapers of Beirut
p251
aVpublished all those cartoonists together \u2014
p252
aVanti-government,
p253
aVpro-government,
p254
aVChristian,
p255
aVMuslim, of course,
p256
aVEnglish-speaking, well, you name it.
p257
aVSo this was a great project.
p258
aVAnd then in Kenya, what we did
p259
aVwas addressing the issue of ethnicity,
p260
aVwhich is a poison in a lot of places in Africa.
p261
aVAnd we did video clips \u2014
p262
aVyou can see them if you go to YouTube/Kenyatoons.
p263
aa(lp264
VSo, preaching for freedom of speech
p265
aVis easy here,
p266
aVbut as you have seen
p267
aVin contexts of repression or division,
p268
aVagain, what can a cartoonist do?
p269
aVHe has to keep his job.
p270
aVWell I believe that in any context anywhere,
p271
aVhe always has the choice at least
p272
aVnot to do a cartoon
p273
aVthat will feed hatred.
p274
aVAnd that's the message I try to convey to them.
p275
aVI think we all always have the choice in the end
p276
aVnot to do the bad thing.
p277
aVBut we need to support
p278
aVthese [unclear], critical
p279
aVand responsible voices
p280
aVin Africa, in Lebanon,
p281
aVin your local newspaper,
p282
aVin the Apple store.
p283
aVToday, tech companies
p284
aVare the world's largest editors.
p285
aVThey decide what is too offensive
p286
aVor too provocative for you to see.
p287
aVSo really, it's not about the freedom of cartoonists;
p288
aVit's about your freedoms.
p289
aVAnd for dictators all over the world,
p290
aVthe good news
p291
aVis when cartoonists,
p292
aVjournalists and activists shut up.
p293
aa(lp294
