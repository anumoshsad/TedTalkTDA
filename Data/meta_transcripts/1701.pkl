VI'm going to talk about the strategizing brain.
p4
aVWe're going to use an unusual combination of tools
p5
aVfrom game theory and neuroscience
p6
aVto understand how people interact socially when value is on the line.
p7
aa(lp8
VSo game theory is a branch of, originally, applied mathematics,
p9
aVused mostly in economics and political science, a little bit in biology,
p10
aVthat gives us a mathematical taxonomy of social life
p11
aVand it predicts what people are likely to do
p12
aVand believe others will do
p13
aVin cases where everyone's actions affect everyone else.
p14
aVThat's a lot of things: competition, cooperation, bargaining,
p15
aVgames like hide-and-seek, and poker.
p16
aa(lp17
VHere's a simple game to get us started.
p18
aVEveryone chooses a number from zero to 100,
p19
aVwe're going to compute the average of those numbers,
p20
aVand whoever's closest to two-thirds of the average wins a fixed prize.
p21
aVSo you want to be a little bit below the average number,
p22
aVbut not too far below, and everyone else wants to be
p23
aVa little bit below the average number as well.
p24
aVThink about what you might pick.
p25
aVAs you're thinking, this is a toy model of something like
p26
aVselling in the stock market during a rising market. Right?
p27
aVYou don't want to sell too early, because you miss out on profits,
p28
aVbut you don't want to wait too late
p29
aVto when everyone else sells, triggering a crash.
p30
aVYou want to be a little bit ahead of the competition, but not too far ahead.
p31
aVOkay, here's two theories about how people might think about this,
p32
aVand then we'll see some data.
p33
aVSome of these will sound familiar because you probably are
p34
aVthinking that way. I'm using my brain theory to see.
p35
aVA lot of people say, "I really don't know what people are going to pick,
p36
aVso I think the average will be 50."
p37
aVThey're not being really strategic at all.
p38
aV"And I'll pick two-thirds of 50. That's 33." That's a start.
p39
aVOther people who are a little more sophisticated,
p40
aVusing more working memory,
p41
aVsay, "I think people will pick 33 because they're going to pick a response to 50,
p42
aVand so I'll pick 22, which is two-thirds of 33."
p43
aVThey're doing one extra step of thinking, two steps.
p44
aVThat's better. And of course, in principle,
p45
aVyou could do three, four or more,
p46
aVbut it starts to get very difficult.
p47
aVJust like in language and other domains, we know that it's hard for people to parse
p48
aVvery complex sentences with a kind of recursive structure.
p49
aVThis is called a cognitive hierarchy theory, by the way.
p50
aVIt's something that I've worked on and a few other people,
p51
aVand it indicates a kind of hierarchy along with
p52
aVsome assumptions about how many people stop at different steps
p53
aVand how the steps of thinking are affected
p54
aVby lots of interesting variables and variant people, as we'll see in a minute.
p55
aVA very different theory, a much more popular one, and an older one,
p56
aVdue largely to John Nash of "A Beautiful Mind" fame,
p57
aVis what's called equilibrium analysis.
p58
aVSo if you've ever taken a game theory course at any level,
p59
aVyou will have learned a little bit about this.
p60
aVAn equilibrium is a mathematical state in which everybody
p61
aVhas figured out exactly what everyone else will do.
p62
aVIt is a very useful concept, but behaviorally,
p63
aVit may not exactly explain what people do
p64
aVthe first time they play these types of economic games
p65
aVor in situations in the outside world.
p66
aVIn this case, the equilibrium makes a very bold prediction,
p67
aVwhich is everyone wants to be below everyone else,
p68
aVtherefore they'll play zero.
p69
aa(lp70
VLet's see what happens. This experiment's been done many, many times.
p71
aVSome of the earliest ones were done in the '90s
p72
aVby me and Rosemarie Nagel and others.
p73
aVThis is a beautiful data set of 9,000 people who wrote in
p74
aVto three newspapers and magazines that had a contest.
p75
aVThe contest said, send in your numbers
p76
aVand whoever is close to two-thirds of the average will win a big prize.
p77
aVAnd as you can see, there's so much data here, you can see the spikes very visibly.
p78
aVThere's a spike at 33. Those are people doing one step.
p79
aVThere is another spike visible at 22.
p80
aVAnd notice, by the way, that most people pick numbers right around there.
p81
aVThey don't necessarily pick exactly 33 and 22.
p82
aVThere's something a little bit noisy around it.
p83
aVBut you can see those spikes, and they're there.
p84
aVThere's another group of people who seem to have
p85
aVa firm grip on equilibrium analysis,
p86
aVbecause they're picking zero or one.
p87
aVBut they lose, right?
p88
aVBecause picking a number that low is actually a bad choice
p89
aVif other people aren't doing equilibrium analysis as well.
p90
aVSo they're smart, but poor.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VWhere are these things happening in the brain?
p95
aVOne study by Coricelli and Nagel gives a really sharp, interesting answer.
p96
aVSo they had people play this game
p97
aVwhile they were being scanned in an fMRI,
p98
aVand two conditions: in some trials,
p99
aVthey're told you're playing another person
p100
aVwho's playing right now and we're going to match up
p101
aVyour behavior at the end and pay you if you win.
p102
aVIn the other trials, they're told, you're playing a computer.
p103
aVThey're just choosing randomly.
p104
aVSo what you see here is a subtraction
p105
aVof areas in which there's more brain activity
p106
aVwhen you're playing people compared to playing the computer.
p107
aVAnd you see activity in some regions we've seen today,
p108
aVmedial prefrontal cortex, dorsomedial, however, up here,
p109
aVventromedial prefrontal cortex,
p110
aVanterior cingulate, an area that's involved
p111
aVin lots of types of conflict resolution, like if you're playing "Simon Says,"
p112
aVand also the right and left temporoparietal junction.
p113
aVAnd these are all areas which are fairly reliably known
p114
aVto be part of what's called a "theory of mind" circuit,
p115
aVor "mentalizing circuit."
p116
aVThat is, it's a circuit that's used to imagine what other people might do.
p117
aVSo these were some of the first studies to see this
p118
aVtied in to game theory.
p119
aa(lp120
VWhat happens with these one- and two-step types?
p121
aVSo we classify people by what they picked,
p122
aVand then we look at the difference between
p123
aVplaying humans versus playing computers,
p124
aVwhich brain areas are differentially active.
p125
aVOn the top you see the one-step players.
p126
aVThere's almost no difference.
p127
aVThe reason is, they're treating other people like a computer, and the brain is too.
p128
aVThe bottom players, you see all the activity in dorsomedial PFC.
p129
aVSo we know that those two-step players are doing something differently.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow if you were to step back and say, "What can we do with this information?"
p132
aVyou might be able to look at brain activity and say,
p133
aV"This person's going to be a good poker player,"
p134
aVor, "This person's socially naive,"
p135
aVand we might also be able to study things
p136
aVlike development of adolescent brains
p137
aVonce we have an idea of where this circuitry exists.
p138
aa(lp139
VOkay. Get ready.
p140
aVI'm saving you some brain activity,
p141
aVbecause you don't need to use your hair detector cells.
p142
aVYou should use those cells to think carefully about this game.
p143
aVThis is a bargaining game.
p144
aVTwo players who are being scanned using EEG electrodes
p145
aVare going to bargain over one to six dollars.
p146
aVIf they can do it in 10 seconds, they're going to actually earn that money.
p147
aVIf 10 seconds goes by and they haven't made a deal, they get nothing.
p148
aVThat's kind of a mistake together.
p149
aVThe twist is that one player, on the left,
p150
aVis informed about how much on each trial there is.
p151
aVThey play lots of trials with different amounts each time.
p152
aVIn this case, they know there's four dollars.
p153
aVThe uninformed player doesn't know,
p154
aVbut they know that the informed player knows.
p155
aVSo the uninformed player's challenge is to say,
p156
aV"Is this guy really being fair
p157
aVor are they giving me a very low offer
p158
aVin order to get me to think that there's only one or two dollars available to split?"
p159
aVin which case they might reject it and not come to a deal.
p160
aVSo there's some tension here between trying to get the most money
p161
aVbut trying to goad the other player into giving you more.
p162
aVAnd the way they bargain is to point on a number line
p163
aVthat goes from zero to six dollars,
p164
aVand they're bargaining over how much the uninformed player gets,
p165
aVand the informed player's going to get the rest.
p166
aVSo this is like a management-labor negotiation
p167
aVin which the workers don't know how much profits
p168
aVthe privately held company has, right,
p169
aVand they want to maybe hold out for more money,
p170
aVbut the company might want to create the impression
p171
aVthat there's very little to split: "I'm giving you the most that I can."
p172
aa(lp173
VFirst some behavior. So a bunch of the subject pairs, they play face to face.
p174
aVWe have some other data where they play across computers.
p175
aVThat's an interesting difference, as you might imagine.
p176
aVBut a bunch of the face-to-face pairs
p177
aVagree to divide the money evenly every single time.
p178
aVBoring. It's just not interesting neurally.
p179
aVIt's good for them. They make a lot of money.
p180
aVBut we're interested in, can we say something about
p181
aVwhen disagreements occur versus don't occur?
p182
aa(lp183
VSo this is the other group of subjects who often disagree.
p184
aVSo they have a chance of \u2014 they bicker and disagree
p185
aVand end up with less money.
p186
aVThey might be eligible to be on "Real Housewives," the TV show.
p187
aVYou see on the left,
p188
aVwhen the amount to divide is one, two or three dollars,
p189
aVthey disagree about half the time,
p190
aVand when the amount is four, five, six, they agree quite often.
p191
aVThis turns out to be something that's predicted
p192
aVby a very complicated type of game theory
p193
aVyou should come to graduate school at CalTech and learn about.
p194
aVIt's a little too complicated to explain right now,
p195
aVbut the theory tells you that this shape kind of should occur.
p196
aVYour intuition might tell you that too.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow I'm going to show you the results from the EEG recording.
p199
aVVery complicated. The right brain schematic
p200
aVis the uninformed person, and the left is the informed.
p201
aVRemember that we scanned both brains at the same time,
p202
aVso we can ask about time-synced activity
p203
aVin similar or different areas simultaneously,
p204
aVjust like if you wanted to study a conversation
p205
aVand you were scanning two people talking to each other
p206
aVand you'd expect common activity in language regions
p207
aVwhen they're actually kind of listening and communicating.
p208
aVSo the arrows connect regions that are active at the same time,
p209
aVand the direction of the arrows flows
p210
aVfrom the region that's active first in time,
p211
aVand the arrowhead goes to the region that's active later.
p212
aVSo in this case, if you look carefully,
p213
aVmost of the arrows flow from right to left.
p214
aVThat is, it looks as if the uninformed brain activity
p215
aVis happening first,
p216
aVand then it's followed by activity in the informed brain.
p217
aVAnd by the way, these were trials where their deals were made.
p218
aVThis is from the first two seconds.
p219
aVWe haven't finished analyzing this data,
p220
aVso we're still peeking in, but the hope is
p221
aVthat we can say something in the first couple of seconds
p222
aVabout whether they'll make a deal or not,
p223
aVwhich could be very useful in thinking about avoiding litigation
p224
aVand ugly divorces and things like that.
p225
aVThose are all cases in which a lot of value is lost
p226
aVby delay and strikes.
p227
aa(lp228
VHere's the case where the disagreements occur.
p229
aVYou can see it looks different than the one before.
p230
aVThere's a lot more arrows.
p231
aVThat means that the brains are synced up
p232
aVmore closely in terms of simultaneous activity,
p233
aVand the arrows flow clearly from left to right.
p234
aVThat is, the informed brain seems to be deciding,
p235
aV"We're probably not going to make a deal here."
p236
aVAnd then later there's activity in the uninformed brain.
p237
aa(lp238
VNext I'm going to introduce you to some relatives.
p239
aVThey're hairy, smelly, fast and strong.
p240
aVYou might be thinking back to your last Thanksgiving.
p241
aVMaybe if you had a chimpanzee with you.
p242
aVCharles Darwin and I and you broke off from the family tree
p243
aVfrom chimpanzees about five million years ago.
p244
aVThey're still our closest genetic kin.
p245
aVWe share 98.8 percent of the genes.
p246
aVWe share more genes with them than zebras do with horses.
p247
aVAnd we're also their closest cousin.
p248
aVThey have more genetic relation to us than to gorillas.
p249
aVSo how humans and chimpanzees behave differently
p250
aVmight tell us a lot about brain evolution.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo this is an amazing memory test
p253
aVfrom Nagoya, Japan, Primate Research Institute,
p254
aVwhere they've done a lot of this research.
p255
aVThis goes back quite a ways. They're interested in working memory.
p256
aVThe chimp is going to see, watch carefully,
p257
aVthey're going to see 200 milliseconds' exposure
p258
aV\u2014 that's fast, that's eight movie frames \u2014
p259
aVof numbers one, two, three, four, five.
p260
aVThen they disappear and they're replaced by squares,
p261
aVand they have to press the squares
p262
aVthat correspond to the numbers from low to high
p263
aVto get an apple reward.
p264
aVLet's see how they can do it.
p265
aVThis is a young chimp. The young ones
p266
aVare better than the old ones, just like humans.
p267
aVAnd they're highly experienced, so they've done this
p268
aVthousands and thousands of time.
p269
aVObviously there's a big training effect, as you can imagine.
p270
aV(Laughter)
p271
aVYou can see they're very blasé and kind of effortless.
p272
aVNot only can they do it very well, they do it in a sort of lazy way.
p273
aVRight? Who thinks you could beat the chimps?
p274
aVWrong. (Laughter)
p275
aVWe can try. We'll try. Maybe we'll try.
p276
aa(lp277
VOkay, so the next part of this study
p278
aVI'm going to go quickly through
p279
aVis based on an idea of Tetsuro Matsuzawa.
p280
aVHe had a bold idea that \u2014 what he called the cognitive trade-off hypothesis.
p281
aVWe know chimps are faster and stronger.
p282
aVThey're also very obsessed with status.
p283
aVHis thought was, maybe they've preserved brain activities
p284
aVand they practice them in development
p285
aVthat are really, really important to them
p286
aVto negotiate status and to win,
p287
aVwhich is something like strategic thinking during competition.
p288
aVSo we're going to check that out
p289
aVby having the chimps actually play a game
p290
aVby touching two touch screens.
p291
aVThe chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers.
p292
aVThey're going to press left or right.
p293
aVOne chimp is called a matcher.
p294
aVThey win if they press left, left,
p295
aVlike a seeker finding someone in hide-and-seek, or right, right.
p296
aVThe mismatcher wants to mismatch.
p297
aVThey want to press the opposite screen of the chimp.
p298
aVAnd the rewards are apple cube rewards.
p299
aVSo here's how game theorists look at these data.
p300
aVThis is a graph of the percentage of times
p301
aVthe matcher picked right on the x-axis,
p302
aVand the percentage of times they predicted right
p303
aVby the mismatcher on the y-axis.
p304
aVSo a point here is the behavior by a pair of players,
p305
aVone trying to match, one trying to mismatch.
p306
aVThe NE square in the middle \u2014 actually NE, CH and QRE \u2014
p307
aVthose are three different theories of Nash equilibrium, and others,
p308
aVtells you what the theory predicts,
p309
aVwhich is that they should match 50-50,
p310
aVbecause if you play left too much, for example,
p311
aVI can exploit that if I'm the mismatcher by then playing right.
p312
aVAnd as you can see, the chimps, each chimp is one triangle,
p313
aVare circled around, hovering around that prediction.
p314
aa(lp315
VNow we move the payoffs.
p316
aVWe're actually going to make the left, left payoff for the matcher a little bit higher.
p317
aVNow they get three apple cubes.
p318
aVGame theoretically, that should actually make the mismatcher's behavior shift,
p319
aVbecause what happens is, the mismatcher will think,
p320
aVoh, this guy's going to go for the big reward,
p321
aVand so I'm going to go to the right, make sure he doesn't get it.
p322
aVAnd as you can see, their behavior moves up
p323
aVin the direction of this change in the Nash equilibrium.
p324
aVFinally, we changed the payoffs one more time.
p325
aVNow it's four apple cubes,
p326
aVand their behavior again moves towards the Nash equilibrium.
p327
aVIt's sprinkled around, but if you average the chimps out,
p328
aVthey're really, really close, within .01.
p329
aVThey're actually closer than any species we've observed.
p330
aa(lp331
VWhat about humans? You think you're smarter than a chimpanzee?
p332
aVHere's two human groups in green and blue.
p333
aVThey're closer to 50-50. They're not responding to payoffs as closely,
p334
aVand also if you study their learning in the game,
p335
aVthey aren't as sensitive to previous rewards.
p336
aVThe chimps are playing better than the humans,
p337
aVbetter in the sense of adhering to game theory.
p338
aVAnd these are two different groups of humans
p339
aVfrom Japan and Africa. They replicate quite nicely.
p340
aVNone of them are close to where the chimps are.
p341
aa(lp342
VSo here are some things we learned today.
p343
aVPeople seem to do a limited amount of strategic thinking
p344
aVusing theory of mind.
p345
aVWe have some preliminary evidence from bargaining
p346
aVthat early warning signs in the brain might be used to predict
p347
aVwhether there will be a bad disagreement that costs money,
p348
aVand chimps are better competitors than humans,
p349
aVas judged by game theory.
