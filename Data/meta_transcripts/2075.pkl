VI'm an industrial engineer.
p4
aVThe goal in my life has always been to make
p5
aVmore and more products
p6
aVin the least amount of time and resources.
p7
aVWhile working at Toyota,
p8
aVall I knew was how to make cars
p9
aVuntil I met Dr. Akira Miyawaki,
p10
aVwho came to our factory to make a forest in it
p11
aVin order to make it carbon-neutral.
p12
aVI was so fascinated
p13
aVthat I decided to learn this methodology
p14
aVby joining his team as a volunteer.
p15
aVSoon, I started making a forest
p16
aVin the backyard of my own house,
p17
aVand this is how it looks after three years.
p18
aa(lp19
VThese forests,
p20
aVcompared to a conventional plantation,
p21
aVgrow 10 times faster,
p22
aVthey're 30 times more dense,
p23
aVand 100 times more biodiverse.
p24
aVWithin two years of having this forest in our backyard,
p25
aVI could observe that the groundwater
p26
aVdidn't dry during summers,
p27
aVthe number of bird species I spotted in this area
p28
aVdoubled.
p29
aVQuality of air became better,
p30
aVand we started harvesting seasonal fruits
p31
aVgrowing effortlessly
p32
aVright in the backyard of our house.
p33
aa(lp34
VI wanted to make more of these forests.
p35
aVI was so moved by these results
p36
aVthat I wanted to make these forests
p37
aVwith the same acumen with which we make cars
p38
aVor write software or do any mainstream business,
p39
aVso I founded a company
p40
aVwhich is an end-to-end service provider
p41
aVto create these native natural forests.
p42
aVBut to make afforestation as a mainstream business
p43
aVor an industry, we had to standardize
p44
aVthe process of forest-making.
p45
aVSo we benchmarked the Toyota Production System
p46
aVknown for its quality and efficiency
p47
aVfor the process of forest-making.
p48
aa(lp49
VFor an example, the core of TPS,
p50
aVToyota Production System, lies in heijunka,
p51
aVwhich is making manufacturing
p52
aVof different models of cars
p53
aVon a single assembly line.
p54
aVWe replaced these cars with trees,
p55
aVusing which now we can make multi-layered forests.
p56
aVThese forests utilize 100 percent vertical space.
p57
aVThey are so dense
p58
aVthat one can't even walk into them.
p59
aVFor an example, we can make a 300-tree forest
p60
aVin an area as small as the parking spaces of six cars.
p61
aVIn order to reduce cost and our own carbon footprint,
p62
aVwe started utilizing local biomass
p63
aVas soil amender and fertilizers.
p64
aVFor example, coconut shells crushed in a machine
p65
aVmixed with rice straw,
p66
aVpowder of rice husk mixed with organic manure
p67
aVis finally dumped in soil on which
p68
aVour forest is planted.
p69
aVOnce planted, we use grass or rice straw
p70
aVto cover the soil
p71
aVso that all the water which goes into irrigation
p72
aVdoesn't get evaporated back into the atmosphere.
p73
aVAnd using these simple improvisations,
p74
aVtoday we can make a forest
p75
aVfor a cost as low as the cost of an iPhone.
p76
aa(lp77
VToday, we are making forests in houses,
p78
aVin schools, even in factories with the corporates.
p79
aVBut that's not enough.
p80
aVThere is a huge number of people
p81
aVwho want to take matters into their own hands.
p82
aVSo we let it happen.
p83
aVToday, we are working on an Internet-based platform
p84
aVwhere we are going to share our methodology
p85
aVon an open source
p86
aVusing which anyone and everyone
p87
aVcan make their own forest
p88
aVwithout our physical presence being there,
p89
aVusing our methodology.
p90
aVAt the click of a button,
p91
aVthey can get to know all the native species
p92
aVof their place.
p93
aVBy installing a small hardware probe on site,
p94
aVwe can do remote soil testing,
p95
aVusing which we can give step-by-step instructions
p96
aVon forest-making remotely.
p97
aVAlso we can monitor the growth of this forest
p98
aVwithout being on site.
p99
aa(lp100
VThis methodology, I believe,
p101
aVhas a potential.
p102
aVBy sharing, we can actually bring back our native forests.
p103
aVNow, when you go back home,
p104
aVif you see a barren piece of land,
p105
aVdo remember that it can be a potential forest.
p106
aa(lp107
VThank you very much. Thanks.
