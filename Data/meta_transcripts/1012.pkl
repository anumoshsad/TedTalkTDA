VSo, a funny thing happened
p4
aVon my way to becoming a brilliant, world-class neuropsychologist:
p5
aVI had a baby.
p6
aVAnd that's not to say
p7
aVI ever went on to become a brilliant, world-class neuropsychologist.
p8
aVSorry, TED.
p9
aVBut I did go on to be a reasonably astute,
p10
aVarguably world-class worrier.
p11
aVOne of my girlfriends in graduate school, Marie,
p12
aVsaid, "Kim, I figured it out.
p13
aVIt's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else;
p14
aVit's just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are."
p15
aa(lp16
VSo in the spirit of full disclosure,
p17
aVI brought some pictures to share.
p18
aVAwwww.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VI'll just say: July.
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VZip!
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VFor safety.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VWater wings \u2014
p35
aVan inch of water.
p36
aVAnd then, finally, all suited up
p37
aVfor the 90-minute drive to Copper Mountain.
p38
aVSo you can get kind of a feel for this.
p39
aVSo my baby, Vander, is eight years old now.
p40
aVAnd, despite being cursed with my athletic inability,
p41
aVhe plays soccer.
p42
aVHe's interested in playing football.
p43
aVHe wants to learn how to ride a unicycle.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo why would I worry?
p46
aVBecause this is what I do. This is what I teach.
p47
aVIt's what I study. It's what I treat.
p48
aVAnd I know that kids get concussed every year.
p49
aVIn fact, more than four million people sustain a concussion every year,
p50
aVand these data are just among kids under 14
p51
aVwho were seen in emergency rooms.
p52
aVAnd so when kids sustain a concussion,
p53
aVwe talk about them getting dinged or getting their bell rung,
p54
aVbut what is it that we're really talking about?
p55
aVLet's take a look.
p56
aa(lp57
V[Concussive Force]
p58
aa(lp59
V"Starsky and Hutch"? Arguably, yes.
p60
aVSo, a car accident.
p61
aVForty miles an hour into a fixed barrier:
p62
aV35 Gs.
p63
aVA heavyweight boxer punches you straight in the face:
p64
aV58 Gs.
p65
aa(lp66
V(Music)
p67
aa(lp68
VIn case you missed it, we'll look again.
p69
aVSo look to the right-hand side of the screen.
p70
aa(lp71
V(Music)
p72
aa(lp73
VWhat would you say?
p74
aVHow many Gs?
p75
aVClose.
p76
aVSeventy-two?
p77
aVWould it be crazy to know:
p78
aV103 Gs?
p79
aVThe average concussive impact
p80
aVis 95 Gs.
p81
aVNow, when the kid on the right doesn't get up,
p82
aVwe know they've had a concussion.
p83
aa(lp84
VBut how about the kid on the left,
p85
aVor the athlete that leaves the field of play?
p86
aVHow do we know if he or she has sustained a concussion?
p87
aVHow do we know
p88
aVthat legislation that would require they be pulled from play,
p89
aVcleared for return to play,
p90
aVapplies to them?
p91
aVThe definition of concussion
p92
aVdoesn't actually require a loss of consciousness.
p93
aVIt requires only a change in consciousness,
p94
aVand that can be any one or a number of symptoms,
p95
aVincluding feeling foggy, feeling dizzy,
p96
aVhearing a ringing in your ear,
p97
aVbeing more impulsive or hostile than usual.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo given all of that and given how darn neurotic I am,
p100
aVhow do I get any sleep at all?
p101
aVBecause I know our brains are resilient.
p102
aVThey're designed to recover from an injury.
p103
aVIf \u2014 God forbid \u2014
p104
aVany of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion,
p105
aVmost of us would go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours
p106
aVto a couple of weeks.
p107
aVBut kids are more vulnerable to brain injury.
p108
aVIn fact, high-school athletes are three times more likely
p109
aVto sustain catastrophic injuries
p110
aVrelative even to their college-age peers,
p111
aVand it takes them longer to return to a symptom-free baseline.
p112
aVAfter that first injury,
p113
aVtheir risk for second injury is exponentially greater.
p114
aVFrom there, their risk for a third injury, greater still, and so on.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd here's the really alarming part:
p117
aVWe don't fully understand the long-term impact of multiple injuries.
p118
aVYou guys may be familiar with this research
p119
aVthat's coming out of the NFL.
p120
aVIn a nutshell, this research suggests that,
p121
aVamong retired NFL players with three or more career concussions,
p122
aVthe incidence of early-onset dementing disease
p123
aVis much greater than it is for the general population.
p124
aVSo you've all seen that \u2014 New York Times, you've seen it.
p125
aVWhat you may not be familiar with
p126
aVis that this research was spearheaded by NFL wives who said,
p127
aV"Isn't it weird that my 46-year-old husband
p128
aVis forever losing his keys?"
p129
aV"Isn't it weird that my 47-year-old husband
p130
aVis forever losing the car?"
p131
aV"Isn't it weird that my 48-year-old husband
p132
aVis forever losing his way home
p133
aVin the car, from the driveway?"
p134
aVI may have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child.
p135
aVSo it's going to be really important
p136
aVthat he be able to drive me around someday.
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VSo, how do we guarantee the safety of our kids?
p141
aVHow can we 100 percent guarantee the safety of our kids?
p142
aVLet me tell you what I've come up with.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VIf only.
p147
aVMy little boy's right there, and he's like, "She's not kidding.
p148
aVShe's totally not kidding."
p149
aVSo in all seriousness:
p150
aVShould my kid play football?
p151
aVShould your kid play football?
p152
aVI don't know.
p153
aVBut I do know there are three things you can do.
p154
aVThe first: study up.
p155
aVYou have to be familiar with the issues we're talking about today.
p156
aVThere are some great resources out there.
p157
aa(lp158
VThe CDC has a program, HEADS UP.
p159
aVIt's at CDC.gov.
p160
aVHEADS UP is specific to concussion in kids.
p161
aVThe second is a resource I'm personally really proud of.
p162
aVWe've just rolled this out in the last couple months \u2014
p163
aVCO Kids With Brain Injury.
p164
aVThis is a great resource for student athletes,
p165
aVteachers, parents, professionals, athletic and coaching staff.
p166
aVIt's a great place to start if you have questions.
p167
aa(lp168
VThe second thing is: speak up.
p169
aVJust two weeks ago,
p170
aVa bill introduced by Senator Kefalas
p171
aVthat would have required athletes, kids under 18,
p172
aVto wear a helmet when they're riding their bike,
p173
aVdied in committee.
p174
aVIt died, in large part,
p175
aVbecause it lacked constituent buy-in;
p176
aVit lacked stakeholder traction.
p177
aVNow, I'm not here to tell you
p178
aVwhat kind of legislation you should or shouldn't support,
p179
aVbut I am going to tell you that, if it matters to you,
p180
aVyour legislators need to know that.
p181
aa(lp182
VSpeak up also with coaching staff.
p183
aVAsk about what kind of protective equipment is available.
p184
aVWhat's the budget for protective equipment?
p185
aVHow old it is?
p186
aVMaybe offer to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear.
p187
aa(lp188
VWhich brings us to: suit up.
p189
aVWear a helmet.
p190
aVThe only way to prevent a bad outcome
p191
aVis to prevent that first injury from happening.
p192
aVRecently, one of my graduate students, Tom, said,
p193
aV"Kim, I've decided to wear a bike helmet on the way to class."
p194
aVAnd Tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet
p195
aVcan reduce the g-force of impact by half.
p196
aVNow, I thought it was because I have this totally compelling helmet crusade,
p197
aVthis epiphany of Tom's.
p198
aVAs it turns out, it occurred to Tom that a $20 helmet
p199
aVis a good way to protect a $100,000 graduate education.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter)
p202
aa(lp203
VSo ...
p204
aVShould Vander play football?
p205
aVI can't say no,
p206
aVbut I can guarantee that every time he leaves the house,
p207
aVthat kid's wearing a helmet \u2014
p208
aVlike, to the car,
p209
aVor at school.
p210
aVSo whether athlete, scholar,
p211
aVoverprotected kid, neurotic mom,
p212
aVor otherwise,
p213
aVhere's my baby, Vander,
p214
aVreminding you
p215
aVto mind your matter.
p216
aa(lp217
VThank you.
