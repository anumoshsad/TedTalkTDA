VWelcome to 10,000 feet.
p4
aVLet me explain why we are here
p5
aVand why some of you have a pine cone close to you.
p6
aVOnce upon a time, I did a book called "How Buildings Learn."
p7
aVToday's event you might call "How Mountains Teach."
p8
aVA little background: For 10 years I've been trying to figure out how to
p9
aVhack civilization so that we can get long-term thinking
p10
aVto be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare \u2014
p11
aVor in some cases, non-existent.
p12
aVIt would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking
p13
aVof the now not just as next week or next quarter, but you know,
p14
aVnext 10,000 years and the last 10,000 years \u2014
p15
aVbasically civilization's story so far.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo we have the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco.
p18
aVIt's an incubator for about a dozen projects,
p19
aVall having to do with continuity over the long term.
p20
aVOur core project is a rather ambitious folly \u2014
p21
aVI suppose, a mythic undertaking: to build a 10,000-year clock
p22
aVthat can really keep good time for that long a period.
p23
aVAnd the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious.
p24
aVGo to the clock. And what we have here is something
p25
aVmany of you saw here three years ago.
p26
aVIt's the first working prototype of the clock.
p27
aVIt's about nine feet high.
p28
aVDesigned by Danny Hillis and Alexander Rose. It's presently in London,
p29
aVand is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo the design problem for today is going to be,
p32
aVhow do you house an eventual monumental clock like this
p33
aVso it can really tick, save time beautifully for 100 centuries?
p34
aVWell, this was the first solution.
p35
aVAlexander Rose came up with this idea
p36
aVof a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps.
p37
aVAnd it looked like a way to go, until you start thinking
p38
aVabout, what does deep time do to a building?
p39
aVWell, this is what deep time does to a building.
p40
aVThis is the Parthenon. It's only 2,450 years old,
p41
aVand look what happened to it.
p42
aVHere's a beautiful project. They really knew it'd last forever,
p43
aVbecause they'd build it out of absolutely huge stones.
p44
aVAnd now it's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for.
p45
aVThat's what happens to buildings. They're vulnerable.
p46
aVEven the most durable and intactable buildings,
p47
aVlike the pyramids of Giza, are in bad shape when you look up close.
p48
aVThey've been looted inside and out.
p49
aVAnd they're built to protect things but they don't protect things.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo we got to thinking, if you can't put things safely in a building,
p52
aVwhere can you safely put them? We thought, OK, underground.
p53
aVHow about underground with a view?
p54
aVUnderground in a place that's really solid.
p55
aVSo the obvious answer was, we need a mountain.
p56
aVYou don't want just any mountain.
p57
aVYou need absolutely the right mountain
p58
aVif you're going to have a clock for 10,000 years.
p59
aVSo here's an image of the long view of the search problem.
p60
aVAnd we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain,
p61
aVso we got looking in the dry areas of the Southwest.
p62
aVWe looked at mesas in New Mexico.
p63
aVWe were looking at dead volcanoes in Arizona.
p64
aa(lp65
VThen Roger Kennedy, who was the director of the National Parks Service,
p66
aVled us to Eastern Nevada,
p67
aVto America's newest and oldest national park,
p68
aVwhich is called Great Basin National Park.
p69
aVIt's right on the eastern border of Nevada.
p70
aVIt's the highest range in the state \u2014 over 13,000 feet.
p71
aVAnd you'll notice that on the left, on the left, on the west, it's very steep,
p72
aVand on the right it's gentle.
p73
aVThis place is remote. It's over 200 miles from any major city.
p74
aVIt's nowhere near any Interstate or railroad.
p75
aVAnd it's \u2014 the only thing that goes by is what's called
p76
aVAmerica's loneliest highway, U.S. 50.
p77
aa(lp78
VNow, inside the yellow line here, on the right is \u2014 that's all national park.
p79
aVInside the green line is national forest.
p80
aVAnd then over to the left is Bureau of Land Management land and some private land.
p81
aVNow, as it happened, that two-mile-long strip right in the middle,
p82
aVthis vertical, was available because it was private land.
p83
aVAnd thanks to Jay Walker who was here and Mitch Kapor who was here,
p84
aVwho started the process, Long Now was able to get that two-mile-long strip of land.
p85
aVAnd now let's look at the grand truth of what's there.
p86
aa(lp87
VWe're in Pole Canyon, looking west up the western escarpment
p88
aVof Mount Washington, which is 11,600 feet on top.
p89
aVThose white cliffs are a dense Cambrian limestone.
p90
aVThat's a 2,000-foot thick formation,
p91
aVand it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock.
p92
aVIt would be a pilgrimage to get to it; it would be a serious hike
p93
aVto get up to where the clock is.
p94
aVSo last June, the Long Now board, some staff and some donors
p95
aVand advisors, made a two-week expedition to the mountain
p96
aVto explore it and investigate, one, if it's the right mountain,
p97
aVand two, if it's the right mountain, how it might actually work for us.
p98
aa(lp99
VNow Danny Hillis sort of framed the problem.
p100
aVHe has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work.
p101
aVIt's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure.
p102
aVIt starts with the image. The image is a picture you have in your mind
p103
aVof the goal at the end of the journey.
p104
aVIn this case it might well be an image of the clock.
p105
aVThen there's the point of embarkation, that is, the point of transition
p106
aVfrom ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest.
p107
aVThen \u2014 this is a nice image of it, there's the labyrinth.
p108
aVThe labyrinth is a concept, it's like a twilight zone,
p109
aVit's a place where it's difficult, where you get disoriented,
p110
aVmaybe you get scared \u2014 but you have to go through it
p111
aVif you're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration.
p112
aVThen there should always be in sight the draw \u2014
p113
aVa kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth
p114
aVto finish the process of getting there.
p115
aa(lp116
VNow Brian Eno, who's been in the thick of the Long Now process,
p117
aVspent two years making a C.D. called "January 7003,"
p118
aVand it's "Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now."
p119
aVBased on \u2014 parts of it are based on an algorithm that Danny Hillis developed,
p120
aVso that a peal of 10 bells
p121
aVmakes a different peal every day for 10,000 years.
p122
aVThe Hillis algorithm. 10 factorial gives you that number.
p123
aVAnd in fact, pretty soon we'll hear the sound.
p124
aVJanuary 7003. There it is.
p125
aa(lp126
VOK, back to Danny's list.
p127
aVNumber five of the seven is the payoff. This is it. The climax.
p128
aVThe goal. The main thing that you're trying to get to.
p129
aVAnd then Danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff.
p130
aVSomething you didn't expect that caps what you did expect.
p131
aVThen there's the return.
p132
aVYou've got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world,
p133
aVso you have time to assimilate what you've learned.
p134
aVAnd then, how about a memento? Number seven.
p135
aVAt the end of it there's something physical,
p136
aVa kind of reward that you take away.
p137
aVIt might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain.
p138
aVSomething that's just yours.
p139
aVHow do you study a mountain
p140
aVfor the kinds of things we're talking about?
p141
aVThis is not a normal building project.
p142
aVWhat do you look for?
p143
aVWhat are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions?
p144
aa(lp145
VStart with borders. If you look on the left side of the cliffs here,
p146
aVthat's national park. That's sacrosanct \u2014
p147
aVyou can't do anything with that. To the right of it is national forest.
p148
aVThere's possibilities. The borders are important.
p149
aVOther elements were mines, weather, approaches and elevation.
p150
aVAnd especially trees. Look at those things up on top there.
p151
aVIt turns out that Mount Washington is covered with bristlecone pines.
p152
aVThey're the world's oldest living thing.
p153
aVPeople think they're just the size of shrubs, but that's not actually true.
p154
aVThere are trees on that mountain that are 5,000 years old and still living.
p155
aVThe wood is so solid it's like stone, and it lasts for a long time.
p156
aVSo when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain,
p157
aVsome of them go back 10,000 years.
p158
aVThe stone itself is absolutely beautiful,
p159
aVsculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there.
p160
aVWe had tree ring analysts from the University of Arizona
p161
aVjoin us on the expedition.
p162
aa(lp163
VNow, if you guys have a pine cone handy,
p164
aVnow's a good time to put it in your hand and feel it, especially on the end.
p165
aVThat's interesting.
p166
aVYou'll find out why it's called a bristlecone pine. A little sensory experience.
p167
aVHere's Danny Hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest
p168
aVon Long Now land. I should say that the age of bristlecones
p169
aVwas discovered, led by a theory.
p170
aVEdmund Schulman in the 1950s
p171
aVhad been studying trees under great stress at Timberline,
p172
aVand came to the realization that he put in an article in Science magazine
p173
aVcalled, "Longevity under Adversity in Conifers."
p174
aVAnd then, based on that principle, he started looking around
p175
aVat the various trees at Timberline,
p176
aVand realized that the bristlecone pines \u2014
p177
aVhe found some in the White Mountains that were over 4,000 years old.
p178
aVLongevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right.
p179
aa(lp180
VOK, onto the mines. The first asking price for the property
p181
aVwhen we looked at it in 1998 was one billion dollars for 180 acres and a couple of mines.
p182
aVBecause the owner said, "There's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain."
p183
aVAnd we said, "Wow, that's great. Listen, we'll counter. How about zero?
p184
aa(lp185
V(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd we're a non-profit foundation, you can give us the property
p188
aVand take a hell of a tax deduction.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VAll you have to do is prove to the government it's worth a billion dollars."
p193
aa(lp194
VWell, a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth,
p195
aVand by and by, thanks to Mitch and Jay,
p196
aVwe were able to buy the whole property for 140,000 dollars.
p197
aVThis is one of the mines. It doesn't have any beryllium in it.
p198
aVIt's called the Pole Adit. And it does have tungsten,
p199
aVa little bit of tungsten, left over, that's the kind of mine it was.
p200
aVBut it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line,
p201
aVdue east into the range, into very interesting territory \u2014 except that,
p202
aVas you'll see when we go inside in a minute,
p203
aVwe were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale.
p204
aVAnd shale is not quite completely competent rock.
p205
aVCompetent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring.
p206
aVThe shale would like some shoring,
p207
aVand so parts of it are caved in in there.
p208
aa(lp209
VThat's Ben Roberts from \u2014 he's the bat specialist from the National Park.
p210
aVBut there are many wonders back in there, like this weird fungus
p211
aVon some of the collapsed timbers.
p212
aVOK, here's another mine that's up on top of the property,
p213
aVand it dates back to 1870.
p214
aVThat's what the property was originally built around \u2014
p215
aVit was a set of mining claims. It was a very productive silver mine.
p216
aVIn fact, it was the highest-operating mine in Nevada,
p217
aVand it ran year round.
p218
aVYou can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet.
p219
aVYou may recognize a couple of the miners there.
p220
aVThere's Jeff Bezos on the right and Paul Saville on the left looking for galena,
p221
aVwhich is the lead-silver thing. They didn't find any.
p222
aVThey both kept their day jobs. Here's the last mine.
p223
aa(lp224
VIt's called the Bonanza Adit. It's down in a canyon.
p225
aVAnd Alexander Rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people
p226
aVfrom the National Park to survey the whole mine. It's a mile deep.
p227
aVAnd they also found four species of bats in there.
p228
aVNow, almost all those mines, by the way, meet underneath the mountain.
p229
aVThey don't quite, but it's something to think about.
p230
aVThey don't quite meet.
p231
aVLet's go to weather. Mountains specialize in interesting weather.
p232
aVWay more interesting than Monterey even today.
p233
aa(lp234
VAnd so one Tuesday morning last June, there we were.
p235
aVWoke up in the morning \u2014 the mountain was covered with snow.
p236
aVThat was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again,
p237
aVthanks to Mitch Kapor, we're building up there.
p238
aVAnd it's a pretty interesting scene.
p239
aVThis is, on the left there, the joyful lady is Pat Irwin,
p240
aVwho's the regional head of the National Forest Service,
p241
aVand they gave us the temporary use permit to be there.
p242
aVWe want a temporary use permit for the clock, eventually \u2014
p243
aV10,000-year temporary use permit.
p244
aa(lp245
V(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
VThe weather station's pretty interesting.
p248
aVKurt Bollacker and Alexander Rose designed a radically wireless station.
p249
aVIt runs on solar, and it sends a signal with that antenna
p250
aVand bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere
p251
aVto a place in Bozeman, Montana, where the data is taken down
p252
aVand then sent through landlines to San Francisco,
p253
aVwhere we put the data in real time up on our website.
p254
aVAnd there you see a week of weather at 9,400 feet on Mount Washington.
p255
aVLet's go to approaches.
p256
aVAs it happens, there are no trails anywhere on Mount Washington,
p257
aVjust a few old mining roads like this,
p258
aVso you have to bushwhack everywhere.
p259
aVBut there's no bears, and there's no poison oak,
p260
aVand there's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time.
p261
aVYou can hike for days and not encounter anybody.
p262
aa(lp263
VWell, here's a potential approach.
p264
aVYou need to come up the Lincoln Canyon.
p265
aVIt's this beautiful world all of its own, surrounded by cliffs,
p266
aVand it's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom,
p267
aVuntil you get to this barrier, and it actually presents a problem.
p268
aVSo you can scratch Lincoln Canyon as an approach.
p269
aVAnother possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain.
p270
aVYou can see why we sometimes call it Long Mountain.
p271
aVAnd from where you're standing at 6,000 feet in the valley,
p272
aVit's an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest
p273
aVthrough that knoll at the front at 7,600 feet.
p274
aVAnd you can carry right on up through meadows
p275
aVand steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at 10,500 feet,
p276
aVwhere there's a bit of a problem.
p277
aa(lp278
VNow, Jeff Bezos advised us when he left at the end of the expedition,
p279
aV"Make the clock inaccessible.
p280
aVThe harder it is to get to, the more people will value it."
p281
aVAnd check \u2014 those are 600-foot vertical walls there.
p282
aVSo Alexander Rose wanted to explore this route,
p283
aVand he started over here on the left from his pickup truck
p284
aVat 8,900 feet and headed up the mountain.
p285
aVNow, as you gain elevation your IQ goes down \u2014
p286
aa(lp287
V(Laughter)
p288
aa(lp289
Vbut your emotional affect goes up,
p290
aVwhich is great for having a mythic experience,
p291
aVwhether you want to or not.
p292
aVIn fact, Danny Hillis can estimate altitude
p293
aVby how much math he can't do in his head.
p294
aa(lp295
V(Laughter)
p296
aa(lp297
VNow, I happened to be on the radio with Alexander
p298
aVwhen he got to this point at the base of the cliffs, and he said, quote,
p299
aV"There's a hidden notch. I think I can get up a ways."
p300
aVNow, he's a rock climber, but you know, he's our executive director.
p301
aVI don't want him killed. I know he's going to love cliffs.
p302
aVI'm saying, "Be careful, be careful, be careful."
p303
aVThen he starts going up, and the next thing I hear is,
p304
aV"I'm half-way up. It's like climbing stairs. I'm going up 60 degrees.
p305
aVIt's a secret passage. It's like something from Tolkien."
p306
aVAnd I'm going, "Careful, careful. Please be careful."
p307
aVAnd then, of course, the next thing I hear is,
p308
aV"I've made it to the top. You can see all of creation from up here."
p309
aVAnd he dashed across the top of the mountains.
p310
aa(lp311
VIn fact, there he is. That's Alexander Rose.
p312
aVFirst ascent of the western face to Mount Washington,
p313
aVand a solo ascent at that.
p314
aVThis discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs
p315
aVand what to do with them.
p316
aVWe realized that we had to name this thing that Alexander discovered.
p317
aVHow about Zander's Crevice? No.
p318
aa(lp319
V(Laughter)
p320
aa(lp321
VSo we finally decided on Alexander's Siq.
p322
aVZander's Siq is named after \u2014 some of you have been to Petra,
p323
aVthere's this wonderful slot canyon that leads into Petra
p324
aVcalled the Siq, and so this is the Siq.
p325
aVAnd it really is hidden. I can't find it in this image,
p326
aVand I'm not sure you can.
p327
aVOnly when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there,
p328
aVand that brings it out.
p329
aa(lp330
VNow, Danny and I were up at this same area one day,
p331
aVand Danny looked over to the right
p332
aVand noticed something halfway up the cliffs,
p333
aVwhich is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it,
p334
aVand supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain
p335
aVcould come out onto that shelf and look down at the view.
p336
aVAnd the people toiling up the mountain could see them,
p337
aVthese tiny little people up there, incredibly halfway up the cliff.
p338
aVHow did they get there? Do I have to do that?
p339
aVAnd so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth.
p340
aVYou can get another angle on Danny's porch
p341
aVby going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there.
p342
aVAnd you need to know that Danny's clock is to be kept accurate
p343
aVby a ray of sunshine, that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day,
p344
aVand the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger
p345
aVwhich resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate.
p346
aVSo even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on,
p347
aVthe clock will keep perfectly good time.
p348
aa(lp349
VSo here we're looking from the south, look north.
p350
aVThis is all Forest Service land. If you go up on top of those cliffs,
p351
aVthat's some of the Long Now land in those trees.
p352
aVAnd if you go up there and look back, then you'll get a sense of
p353
aVwhat the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain.
p354
aVThat's the long view. That's 80 miles to the horizon.
p355
aVAnd that's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs.
p356
aVThat's a different place to be. It's 11,400 feet and it's exquisite.
p357
aVNow, if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs,
p358
aVit's 600 foot, just about a yard to the left of Kurt Bollacker's foot,
p359
aVthere is a 600-foot drop. He's ambling on over to Zander's Siq.
p360
aVThat's what it looks like looking down it.
p361
aVWe should probably put in a rail or something.
p362
aVOver on the eastern side it's gentle, as you can see.
p363
aVAnd that's not snow \u2014 that's what the white limestone looks like.
p364
aVYou also see there a bighorn sheep.
p365
aVTheir herd was reintroduced from Wyoming.
p366
aVAnd they're doing pretty well, but they've got a bit of trouble.
p367
aa(lp368
VThis is Danny Hillis, and he's figuring out a design problem.
p369
aVhe's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of Long Now land
p370
aVwould appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain.
p371
aVbecause the real peak is hidden around the corner.
p372
aVThis is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest.
p373
aVAnd as it turned out the answer is, yes,
p374
aVthat is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak,
p375
aVand that might be conjured with.
p376
aVWe gradually realized we have three serious design domains to work on with this.
p377
aVOne is the experience of the mountain.
p378
aVAnother is the experience in the mountain.
p379
aVAnd the third is the experience from the mountain,
p380
aVwhich is really dominated by the view shed
p381
aVof the spring valley there behind Danny,
p382
aVand if you look off to the right, out there,
p383
aV15 miles across to the Schell Creek range.

VIn the front, there are 10 ranches strung right along the base of the mountains
p386
aVusing the water from the mountains.
p387
aVIn fact, there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air.
p388
aVOne of the ranches is called the Kirkeby Ranch,
p389
aVand I'll take you there for a minute.
p390
aVIt's a very nice ranch.
p391
aVAlfalfa and cattle, run by Paul and Ronnie Brenham,
p392
aVand it's pretty idyllic. It's also hard work.
p393
aVAnd most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going.
p394
aVThis is their view to the west of the Schell Creek range.
p395
aVAnd if you go out to that line of trees at the far end,
p396
aVyou'll see what the valley used to look like.
p397
aVThis is Rocky Mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years.
p398
aa(lp399
VAnd a scheme emerged that Long Now is looking to see
p400
aVif it might be possible to buy up the whole valley,
p401
aVbecause those 10 ranches with their 17,000 acres
p402
aVdominate a 500 square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on,
p403
aVand there's a possibility that you could get the whole thing
p404
aVfor five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition,
p405
aVand somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park,
p406
aVand it would double the size of Great Basin National Park. That would be swell.
p407
aa(lp408
VOK, let's take one more look at the mountain itself.
p409
aVThe clock experience should be profound,
p410
aVbut from the outside it should be invisible.
p411
aVNow, at the base of the high cliffs there's this natural cave.
p412
aVIt's only about 12 feet deep, but what if it were deepened from inside?
p413
aVYou excavated from somewhere, came up from inside and deepened it.
p414
aVAnd then you could have an entrance
p415
aVwhich was very rough and narrow as you first went in,
p416
aVthat gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite.
p417
aVAnd this stone takes a perfect polish.
p418
aVYou'd have a polished set of passages and chambers in there
p419
aVeventually leading to the 10,000 year clock.
p420
aa(lp421
VAnd it's not a mine. This would be a nuanced evocation
p422
aVof the basic structure of the mountain,
p423
aVand you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from outside.
p424
aVThis is architecture not made by building,
p425
aVbut by what you very carefully take away.
p426
aVSo that's what the mountain taught us.
p427
aVMost of the amazingness of the clock
p428
aVwe can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain.
p429
aVAll we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them.
p430
aVIt's not a clock in a mountain \u2014 it's a mountain clock.
p431
aVNow, the Tewa Indians in the Southwest have a saying
p432
aVfor what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything.
p433
aVThey say, "pin peya obe" \u2014 welcome to the mountain.
p434
aa(lp435
VThank you.
