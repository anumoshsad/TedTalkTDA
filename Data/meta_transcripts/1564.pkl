VIt's time to start designing for our ears.
p4
aVArchitects and designers tend to focus
p5
aVexclusively on these.
p6
aVThey use these to design with and they design for them,
p7
aVwhich is why we end up sitting in restaurants that look
p8
aVlike this \u2014 (loud crowd noise) \u2014 and sound like this,
p9
aVshouting from a foot away to try and be heard
p10
aVby our dinner companion,
p11
aVor why we get on airplanes \u2014 (flight attendant announcements) \u2014 which cost 200 million pounds,
p12
aVwith somebody talking through an old-fashioned telephone handset
p13
aVon a cheap stereo system,
p14
aVmaking us jump out of our skins.
p15
aa(lp16
VWe're designing environments that make us crazy. (Laughter)
p17
aVAnd it's not just our quality of life which suffers.
p18
aVIt's our health,
p19
aVour social behavior, and our productivity as well.
p20
aa(lp21
VHow does this work? Well, two ways.
p22
aVFirst of all, ambience. I have a whole TEDTalk about this.
p23
aVSound affects us physiologically, psychologically,
p24
aVcognitively and behaviorally all the time.
p25
aVThe sound around us is affecting us
p26
aVeven though we're not conscious of it.
p27
aVThere's a second way though, as well.
p28
aVThat's interference. Communication requires sending
p29
aVand receiving, and I have another whole TEDTalk
p30
aVabout the importance of conscious listening,
p31
aVbut I can send as well as I like,
p32
aVand you can be brilliant conscious listeners.
p33
aVIf the space I'm sending it in is not effective,
p34
aVthat communication can't happen.
p35
aa(lp36
VSpaces tend to include noise and acoustics.
p37
aVA room like this has acoustics, this one very good acoustics.
p38
aVMany rooms are not so good.
p39
aVLet me give you some examples from a couple of areas
p40
aVwhich I think we all care about: health and education.
p41
aV(Hospital noises) When I was visiting my terminally ill father
p42
aVin a hospital, I was asking myself,
p43
aVhow does anybody get well in a place that sounds like this?
p44
aVHospital sound is getting worse all the time.
p45
aVNoise levels in hospitals have doubled
p46
aVin the last few years, and it affects not just the patients
p47
aVbut also the people working there.
p48
aVI think we would like for dispensing errors to be zero,
p49
aVwouldn't we? And yet, as noise levels go up, so do
p50
aVthe errors in dispensing made by the staff in hospitals.
p51
aVMost of all, though, it affects the patients,
p52
aVand that could be you, it could be me.
p53
aVSleep is absolutely crucial for recovery.
p54
aVIt's when we regenerate, when we rebuild ourselves,
p55
aVand with threatening noise like this going on,
p56
aVyour body, even if you are able to sleep, your body
p57
aVis telling you, "I'm under threat. This is dangerous."
p58
aVAnd the quality of sleep is degraded, and so is our recovery.
p59
aVThere are just huge benefits to come
p60
aVfrom designing for the ears in our health care.
p61
aVThis is an area I intend to take on this year.
p62
aa(lp63
VEducation.
p64
aVWhen I see a classroom that looks like this,
p65
aVcan you imagine how this sounds?
p66
aVI am forced to ask myself a question.
p67
aV("Do architects have ears?") (Laughter)
p68
aVNow, that's a little unfair. Some of my best friends
p69
aVare architects. (Laughter) And they definitely do have ears.
p70
aVBut I think sometimes they don't use them
p71
aVwhen they're designing buildings. Here's a case in point.
p72
aVThis is a 32-million-pound flagship academy school
p73
aVwhich was built quite recently in the U.K. and designed
p74
aVby one of Britain's top architects.
p75
aVUnfortunately, it was designed like a corporate
p76
aVheadquarters, with a vast central atrium
p77
aVand classrooms leading off it with no back walls at all.
p78
aVThe children couldn't hear their teachers.
p79
aVThey had to go back in and spend 600,000 pounds
p80
aVputting the walls in. Let's stop this madness
p81
aVof open plan classrooms right now, please.
p82
aa(lp83
VIt's not just these modern buildings which suffer.
p84
aVOld-fashioned classrooms suffer too.
p85
aVA study in Florida just a few years ago found
p86
aVthat if you're sitting where this photograph was taken
p87
aVin the classroom, row four, speech intelligibility
p88
aVis just 50 percent.
p89
aVChildren are losing one word in two.
p90
aVNow that doesn't mean they only get half their education,
p91
aVbut it does mean they have to work very hard
p92
aVto join the dots and understand what's going on.
p93
aa(lp94
VThis is affected massively by reverberation time,
p95
aVhow reverberant a room is.
p96
aVIn a classroom with a reverberation time of 1.2 seconds,
p97
aVwhich is pretty common, this is what it sounds like.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Inaudible echoing voice)
p100
aa(lp101
VNot so good, is it?
p102
aVIf you take that 1.2 seconds down to 0.4 seconds
p103
aVby installing acoustic treatments, sound absorbing materials
p104
aVand so forth, this is what you get.
p105
aa(lp106
VVoice: In language, infinitely many words can be written
p107
aVwith a small set of letters. In arithmetic,
p108
aVinfinitely many numbers can be composed
p109
aVfrom just a few digits with the help of the simple zero.
p110
aa(lp111
VJulian Treasure: What a difference.
p112
aVNow that education you would receive,
p113
aVand thanks to the British acoustician Adrian James
p114
aVfor those simulations. The signal was the same,
p115
aVthe background noise was the same.
p116
aVAll that changed was the acoustics of the classroom
p117
aVin those two examples.
p118
aa(lp119
VIf education can be likened to watering a garden,
p120
aVwhich is a fair metaphor, sadly, much of the water
p121
aVis evaporating before it reaches the flowers,
p122
aVespecially for some groups,
p123
aVfor example, those with hearing impairment.
p124
aVNow that's not just deaf children. That could be any child
p125
aVwho's got a cold, glue ear, an ear infection,
p126
aVeven hay fever. On a given day, one in eight children
p127
aVfall into that group, on any given day.
p128
aVThen you have children for whom English is a second language,
p129
aVor whatever they're being taught in is a second language.
p130
aVIn the U.K., that's more than 10 percent of the school population.
p131
aVAnd finally, after Susan Cain's wonderful TEDTalk in February,
p132
aVwe know that introverts find it very difficult to relate
p133
aVwhen they're in a noisy environment doing group work.
p134
aVAdd those up. That is a lot of children
p135
aVwho are not receiving their education properly.
p136
aa(lp137
VIt's not just the children who are affected, though.
p138
aV(Noisy conversation) This study in Germany found
p139
aVthe average noise level in classrooms is 65 decibels.
p140
aVI have to really raise my voice to talk over 65 decibels
p141
aVof sound, and teachers are not just raising their voices.
p142
aVThis chart maps the teacher's heart rate
p143
aVagainst the noise level.
p144
aVNoise goes up, heart rate goes up.
p145
aVThat is not good for you.
p146
aVIn fact, 65 decibels is the very level at which this big survey
p147
aVof all the evidence on noise and health found that, that is
p148
aVthe threshold for the danger of myocardial infarction.
p149
aVTo you and me, that's a heart attack.
p150
aVIt may not be pushing the boat out too far to suggest
p151
aVthat many teachers are losing significant life expectancy
p152
aVby teaching in environments like that day after day.
p153
aa(lp154
VWhat does it cost to treat a classroom
p155
aVdown to that 0.4-second reverberation time?
p156
aVTwo and a half thousand pounds.
p157
aVAnd the Essex study which has just been done in the U.K.,
p158
aVwhich incidentally showed that when you do this,
p159
aVyou do not just make a room that's suitable
p160
aVfor hearing-impaired children, you make a room
p161
aVwhere behavior improves, and results improve significantly,
p162
aVthis found that sending a child out of area to a school
p163
aVthat does have such a room, if you don't have one,
p164
aVcosts 90,000 pounds a year.
p165
aVI think the economics are pretty clear on this.
p166
aa(lp167
VI'm glad that debate is happening on this.
p168
aVI just moderated a major conference in London
p169
aVa few weeks ago called Sound Education,
p170
aVwhich brought together top acousticians,
p171
aVgovernment people, teachers, and so forth.
p172
aVWe're at last starting to debate this issue, and the benefits
p173
aVthat are available for designing for the ears in education,
p174
aVunbelievable.
p175
aVOut of that conference, incidentally, also came
p176
aVa free app which is designed to help children study
p177
aVif they're having to work at home, for example,
p178
aVin a noisy kitchen.
p179
aVAnd that's free out of that conference.
p180
aa(lp181
VLet's broaden the perspective a little bit
p182
aVand look at cities.
p183
aVWe have urban planners.
p184
aVWhere are the urban sound planners?
p185
aVI don't know of one in the world, and the opportunity is there
p186
aVto transform our experience in our cities.
p187
aVThe World Health Organization estimates
p188
aVthat a quarter of Europe's population is having its sleep
p189
aVdegraded by noise in cities. We can do better than that.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd in our offices, we spend a lot of time at work.
p192
aVWhere are the office sound planners?
p193
aVPeople who say, don't sit that team next to this team,
p194
aVbecause they like noise and they need quiet.
p195
aVOr who say, don't spend all your budget on a huge screen
p196
aVin the conference room,
p197
aVand then place one tiny microphone
p198
aVin the middle of a table for 30 people. (Laughter)
p199
aVIf you can hear me, you can understand me
p200
aVwithout seeing me. If you can see me without hearing me,
p201
aVthat does not work.
p202
aVSo office sound is a huge area, and incidentally,
p203
aVnoise in offices has been shown to make people
p204
aVless helpful, less enjoy their teamwork,
p205
aVand less productive at work.
p206
aa(lp207
VFinally, we have homes. We use interior designers.
p208
aVWhere are the interior sound designers?
p209
aVHey, let's all be interior sound designers,
p210
aVtake on listening to our rooms and designing sound
p211
aVthat's effective and appropriate.
p212
aa(lp213
VMy friend Richard Mazuch, an architect in London,
p214
aVcoined the phrase "invisible architecture."
p215
aVI love that phrase.
p216
aVIt's about designing, not appearance, but experience,
p217
aVso that we have spaces that sound as good as they look,
p218
aVthat are fit for purpose, that improve our quality of life,
p219
aVour health and well being, our social behavior
p220
aVand our productivity.
p221
aa(lp222
VIt's time to start designing for the ears.
p223
aVThank you. (Applause)
