VI'm going to start by asking you a question:
p4
aVIs anyone familiar with the blue algae problem?
p5
aVOkay, so most of you are.
p6
aVI think we can all agree it's a serious issue.
p7
aVNobody wants to drink blue algae-contaminated water,
p8
aVor swim in a blue algae-infested lake.
p9
aVRight?
p10
aa(lp11
VI hope you won't be disappointed,
p12
aVbut today, I won't be talking about blue algae.
p13
aVInstead, I'll be talking about the main cause
p14
aVat the root of this issue,
p15
aVwhich I will be referring to as the phosphorus crisis.
p16
aVWhy have I chosen to talk to you about the phosphorus crisis today?
p17
aVFor the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it.
p18
aVAnd by the end of my presentation, I hope that the general public
p19
aVwill be more aware of this crisis and this issue.
p20
aa(lp21
VNow, the problem is that if I ask,
p22
aVwhy do we find ourselves in this situation with blue algae?
p23
aVThe answer is that it comes from how we farm.
p24
aVWe use fertilizers in our farming, chemical fertilizers.
p25
aVWhy do we use chemical fertilizers in agriculture?
p26
aVBasically, to help plants grow and to produce a better yield.
p27
aVThe issue is that this is set to engender
p28
aVan environmental problem that is without precedent.
p29
aa(lp30
VBefore going further, let me give you a crash course in plant biology.
p31
aVSo, what does a plant need in order to grow?
p32
aVA plant, quite simply, needs light, it needs CO2,
p33
aVbut even more importantly, it needs nutrients,
p34
aVwhich it draws from the soil.
p35
aVSeveral of these nutrients are essential chemical elements:
p36
aVphosphorus, nitrogen and calcium.
p37
aVSo, the plant\u2019s roots will extract these resources.
p38
aa(lp39
VToday I'll be focusing on a major problem that is linked to phosphorus.
p40
aVWhy phosphorus in particular?
p41
aVBecause it is the most problematic chemical element.
p42
aVBy the end of my presentation, you will have seen
p43
aVwhat these problems are, and where we are today.
p44
aa(lp45
VPhosphorus is a chemical element
p46
aVthat is essential to life. This is a very important point.
p47
aVI\u2019d like everyone to understand precisely what the phosphorus issue is.
p48
aVPhosphorus is a key component in several molecules,
p49
aVin many of our molecules of life.
p50
aVExperts in the field will know
p51
aVthat cellular communication is phosphorus-based \u2014
p52
aVphosphorylation, dephosphorylation.
p53
aVCell membranes are phosphorus-based: These are called phospholipids.
p54
aVThe energy in all living things, ATP, is phosphorus-based.
p55
aVAnd more importantly still, phosphorus is a key component of DNA,
p56
aVsomething everyone is familiar with, and which is shown in this image.
p57
aVDNA is our genetic heritage.
p58
aVIt is extremely important, and once again, phosphorus is a key player.
p59
aa(lp60
VNow, where do we find this phosphorus?
p61
aVAs humans, where do we find it?
p62
aVAs I explained earlier,
p63
aVplants extract phosphorus from the soil, through water.
p64
aVSo, we humans get it from the things we eat:
p65
aVplants, vegetables, fruits,
p66
aVand also from eggs, meat and milk.
p67
aVIt\u2019s true that some humans eat better than others.
p68
aVSome are happier than others.
p69
aVAnd now, looking at this picture, which speaks for itself,
p70
aVwe see modern agriculture,
p71
aVwhich I also refer to as intensive agriculture.
p72
aVIntensive agriculture is based on the use of chemical fertilizers.
p73
aVWithout them, we would not manage to produce enough
p74
aVto feed the world's population.
p75
aVSpeaking of humans, there are currently 7 billion of us on Earth.
p76
aVIn less than 40 years, there will be 9 billion of us.
p77
aVAnd the question is a simple one: Do we have enough phosphorus
p78
aVto feed our future generations?
p79
aa(lp80
VSo, in order to understand these issues, where do we find our phosphorus?
p81
aVLet me explain.
p82
aVBut first, let\u2019s just suppose
p83
aVthat we are using 100 percent of a given dose of phosphorus.
p84
aVOnly 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant. Eighty-five percent is lost.
p85
aVIt goes into the soil, ending its journey in the lakes,
p86
aVresulting in lakes with extra phosphorus, which leads to the blue algae problem.
p87
aVSo, you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a problem here, something that is illogical.
p88
aVA hundred percent of the phosphorus is used, but only 15 percent goes to the plant.
p89
aVYou\u2019re going to tell me it\u2019s wasteful.
p90
aVYes, it is. What is worse is that it is very expensive.
p91
aVNobody wants to throw their money out the window,
p92
aVbut unfortunately that's what is happening here.
p93
aVEighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost.
p94
aVModern agriculture depends on phosphorus.
p95
aVAnd because in order to get 15 percent of it to the plant, all the rest is lost,
p96
aVwe have to add more and more.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow, where will we get this phosphorus from?
p99
aVBasically, we get it out of mines.
p100
aVThis is the cover of an extraordinary article
p101
aVpublished in Nature in 2009,
p102
aVwhich really launched the discussion about the phosphorus crisis.
p103
aVPhosphorus, a nutrient essential to life, which is becoming increasingly scarce,
p104
aVyet nobody is talking about it.
p105
aVAnd everyone agrees: Politicians and scientists are in agreement
p106
aVthat we are headed for a phosphorus crisis.
p107
aa(lp108
VWhat you are seeing here is an open-pit mine in the U.S.,
p109
aVand to give you an idea of the dimensions of this mine,
p110
aVif you look in the top right-hand corner, the little crane you can see,
p111
aVthat is a giant crane.
p112
aVSo that really puts it into perspective.
p113
aVSo, we get phosphorus from mines.
p114
aVAnd if I make a comparison with oil,
p115
aVthere\u2019s an oil crisis, we talk about it, we talk about global warming,
p116
aVyet we never mention the phosphorus crisis.
p117
aVTo come back to the oil problem, oil is something we can replace.
p118
aVWe can use biofuels, or solar power,
p119
aVor hydropower, but phosphorus is an essential element,
p120
aVindispensable to life, and we can\u2019t replace it.
p121
aa(lp122
VWhat is the current state of the world's phosphorus reserves?
p123
aVThis graph gives you a rough idea of where we are today.
p124
aVThe black line represents predictions for phosphorus reserves.
p125
aVIn 2030, we\u2019ll reach the peak.
p126
aVBy the end of this century, it will all be gone.
p127
aVThe dotted line shows where we are today.
p128
aVAs you can see, they meet in 2030, I\u2019ll be retired by then.
p129
aVBut we are indeed heading for a major crisis,
p130
aVand I\u2019d like people to become aware of this problem.
p131
aa(lp132
VDo we have a solution?
p133
aVWhat are we to do? We are faced with a paradox.
p134
aVLess and less phosphorus will be available.
p135
aVBy 2050 there will be 9 billion of us,
p136
aVand according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization,
p137
aVwe will need to produce twice as much food in 2050 than we do today.
p138
aVSo, we will have less phosphorus, but we'll need to produce more food.
p139
aVWhat should we do?
p140
aVIt truly is a paradoxical situation.
p141
aVDo we have a solution, or an alternative
p142
aVwhich will allow us to optimize phosphorus use?
p143
aa(lp144
VRemember that 80 percent is destined to be lost.
p145
aVThe solution I'm offering today is one that has existed for a very long time,
p146
aVeven before plants existed on Earth,
p147
aVand it's a microscopic mushroom that is very mysterious,
p148
aVvery simple, and yet also extremely complex.
p149
aVI've been fascinated by this little mushroom for over 16 years now.
p150
aVIt has led me to further my research
p151
aVand to use it as a model for my laboratory research.
p152
aa(lp153
VThis mushroom exists in symbiosis with the roots.
p154
aVBy symbiosis, I mean a bidirectional and mutually beneficial association
p155
aVwhich is also called mycorrhiza.
p156
aVThis slide illustrates the elements of a mycorrhiza.
p157
aVYou\u2019re looking at the root of wheat,
p158
aVone of the world\u2019s most important plants.
p159
aVNormally, a root will find phosphorus all by itself.
p160
aVIt will go in search of phosphorus,
p161
aVbut only within the one millimeter which surrounds it.
p162
aVBeyond one millimeter, the root is ineffective.
p163
aVIt cannot go further in its search for phosphorus.
p164
aVNow, imagine this tiny, microscopic mushroom.
p165
aVIt grows much faster,
p166
aVand is much better designed to seek out phosphorus.
p167
aVIt can go beyond the root\u2019s one-millimeter scope
p168
aVto seek out phosphorus.
p169
aa(lp170
VI haven\u2019t invented anything at all;
p171
aVit's a biotechnology that has existed for 450 million years.
p172
aVAnd over time, this mushroom has evolved and adapted to seek out
p173
aVeven the tiniest trace of phosphorus, and to put it to use,
p174
aVto make it available to the plant.
p175
aVWhat you\u2019re seeing here, in the real world, is a carrot root,
p176
aVand the mushroom with its very fine filaments.
p177
aVLooking closer, we can see that this mushroom
p178
aVis very gentle in its penetration.
p179
aVIt will proliferate between the root's cells,
p180
aVeventually penetrating a cell
p181
aVand starting to form a typical arbuscular structure,
p182
aVwhich will considerably increase the exchange interface
p183
aVbetween the plant and the mushroom.
p184
aVAnd it is through this structure that mutual exchanges will occur.
p185
aVIt\u2019s a win-win trade:
p186
aVI give you phosphorus, and you feed me.
p187
aVTrue symbiosis.
p188
aa(lp189
VNow let's add a mycorrhiza plant
p190
aVinto the diagram I used earlier.
p191
aVAnd instead of using a 100 percent dose, I\u2019m going to reduce it to 25 percent.
p192
aVYou\u2019ll see that of this 25 percent, most will benefit the plant,
p193
aVmore than 90 percent.
p194
aVA very small amount of phosphorus will remain in the soil.
p195
aVThat's completely natural.
p196
aVWhat's more is that in certain cases, we don't even need to add phosphorus.
p197
aa(lp198
VIf you recall the graphs I showed you earlier,
p199
aV85 percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil,
p200
aVand the plants are unable to access it.
p201
aVEven though it is present in the soil, it is in insoluble form.
p202
aVThe plant is only able to seek out soluble forms.
p203
aVThe mushroom is capable of dissolving this insoluble form
p204
aVand making it available for the plant to use.
p205
aVTo further support my argument, here is a picture that speaks for itself.
p206
aVThese are trials in a field of sorghum.
p207
aVOn the left side, you see the yield produced using conventional agriculture,
p208
aVwith a 100 percent phosphorus dose.
p209
aVOn the other side, the dose was reduced to 50 percent,
p210
aVand just look at the yield.
p211
aVWith only a half-dose, we achieved a better yield.
p212
aa(lp213
VThis is to show you that this method works.
p214
aVAnd in some cases, in Cuba, Mexico and India,
p215
aVthe dose can be reduced to 25 percent, and in several other cases,
p216
aVthere's no need to add any phosphorus at all,
p217
aVbecause the mushrooms are so well adapted
p218
aVto finding phosphorus and drawing it from the soil.
p219
aVThis is an example of soy production in Canada.
p220
aVMycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other.
p221
aVAnd here, where blue indicates a better yield, and yellow a weaker yield.
p222
aVThe black rectangle is the plot
p223
aVfrom which the mycorrhiza was added.
p224
aVIn other words, as I already said, I have invented nothing.
p225
aVMycorrhiza has existed for 450 million years,
p226
aVand it has even helped modern-day plant species to diversify.
p227
aa(lp228
VSo, this it isn't something that is still undergoing lab tests.
p229
aVMycorrhiza exists, it works,
p230
aVit's produced at an industrial scale and commercialized worldwide.
p231
aVThe problem is that people are not aware of it.
p232
aVPeople like food producers and farmers are still not aware of this problem.
p233
aVWe have a technology that works,
p234
aVand one that, if used correctly, will alleviate some of the pressure
p235
aVwe are putting on the world's phosphorus reserves.
p236
aa(lp237
VIn conclusion, I am a scientist and a dreamer.
p238
aVI'm passionate about this topic.
p239
aVSo if you were to ask me what my retirement dream is,
p240
aVwhich will be at the moment we reach that phosphorus peak,
p241
aVit would be that we use one label, "Made with mycorrhiza,"
p242
aVand that my children and grandchildren
p243
aVbuy products bearing that label too.
p244
aa(lp245
VThank you for your attention.
