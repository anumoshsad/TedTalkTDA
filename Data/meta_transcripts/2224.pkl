V(Clicking)
p4
aVI was born with bilateral retinoblastoma,
p5
aVretinal cancer.
p6
aVMy right eye was removed
p7
aVat seven months of age.
p8
aVI was 13 months when they removed my left eye.
p9
aVThe first thing I did upon awakening from that last surgery
p10
aVwas to climb out of my crib
p11
aVand begin wandering around the intensive care nursery,
p12
aVprobably looking for the one who did this to me.
p13
aV(Laughter)
p14
aVEvidently, wandering around the nursery
p15
aVwas not a problem for me without eyes.
p16
aVThe problem was getting caught.
p17
aa(lp18
VIt's impressions about blindness
p19
aVthat are far more threatening
p20
aVto blind people than the blindness itself.
p21
aVThink for a moment about your own impressions of blindness.
p22
aVThink about your reactions when I first came onto the stage,
p23
aVor the prospect of your own blindness,
p24
aVor a loved one going blind.
p25
aVThe terror is incomprehensible to most of us,
p26
aVbecause blindness
p27
aVis thought to epitomize ignorance and unawareness,
p28
aVhapless exposure to the ravages of the dark unknown.
p29
aVHow poetic.
p30
aa(lp31
VFortunately for me, my parents were not poetic.
p32
aVThey were pragmatic.
p33
aVThey understood that ignorance and fear were but matters of the mind,
p34
aVand the mind is adaptable.
p35
aVThey believed that I should grow up
p36
aVto enjoy the same freedoms and responsibilities as everyone else.
p37
aVIn their own words, I would move out \u2014
p38
aVwhich I did when I was 18 \u2014
p39
aVI will pay taxes \u2014
p40
aVthanks \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p41
aVand they knew the difference between love and fear.
p42
aVFear immobilizes us in the face of challenge.
p43
aVThey knew that blindness would pose a significant challenge.
p44
aVI was not raised with fear.
p45
aVThey put my freedom first before all else,
p46
aVbecause that is what love does.
p47
aa(lp48
VNow, moving forward, how do I manage today?
p49
aVThe world is a much larger nursery.
p50
aVFortunately, I have my trusty long cane,
p51
aVlonger than the canes used by most blind people.
p52
aVI call it my freedom staff.
p53
aVIt will keep me, for example,
p54
aVfrom making an undignified  departure from the stage. (Laughter)
p55
aVI do see that cliff edge.
p56
aVThey warned us earlier that every imaginable mishap
p57
aVhas occurred to speakers up here on the stage.
p58
aVI don't care to set a new precedent.
p59
aa(lp60
VBut beyond that,
p61
aVmany of you may have heard me clicking as I came onto the stage \u2014
p62
aV(Clicking) \u2014
p63
aVwith my tongue.
p64
aVThose are flashes of sound
p65
aVthat go out and reflect from surfaces all around me,
p66
aVjust like a bat's sonar,
p67
aVand return to me with patterns,  with pieces of information,
p68
aVmuch as light does for you.
p69
aVAnd my brain, thanks to my parents,
p70
aVhas been activated to form images in my visual cortex,
p71
aVwhich we now call the imaging system,
p72
aVfrom those patterns of information, much as your brain does.
p73
aVI call this process flash sonar.
p74
aVIt is how I have learned to see through my blindness,
p75
aVto navigate my journey
p76
aVthrough the dark unknowns of my own challenges,
p77
aVwhich has earned me the moniker
p78
aV"the remarkable Batman."
p79
aa(lp80
VNow, Batman I will accept.
p81
aVBats are cool. Batman is cool.
p82
aVBut I was not raised to think of myself as in any way remarkable.
p83
aVI have always regarded myself much like anyone else
p84
aVwho navigates the dark unknowns of their own challenges.
p85
aVIs that so remarkable?
p86
aVI do not use my eyes, I use my brain.
p87
aa(lp88
VNow, someone, somewhere,
p89
aVmust think that's remarkable, or I wouldn't be up here,
p90
aVbut let's consider this for a moment.
p91
aVEveryone out there
p92
aVwho faces or who has ever faced a challenge,
p93
aVraise your hands.
p94
aVWhoosh. Okay.
p95
aVLots of hands going up, a moment, let me do a head count.
p96
aV(Clicking)
p97
aVThis will take a while. (Clicking) (Laughter)
p98
aVOkay, lots of hands in the air.
p99
aVKeep them up. I have an idea.
p100
aVThose of you who use your brains to navigate these challenges,
p101
aVput your hands down.
p102
aVOkay, anyone with your hands still up
p103
aVhas challenges of your own. (Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VSo we all face challenges,
p106
aVand we all face the dark unknown,
p107
aVwhich is endemic to most challenges, which is what most of us fear, okay?
p108
aVBut we all have brains
p109
aVthat allow us, that activate to allow us
p110
aVto navigate the journey through these challenges. Okay?
p111
aa(lp112
VCase in point: I came up here
p113
aVand \u2014 (Clicking) \u2014 they wouldn't tell me
p114
aVwhere the lectern was.
p115
aVSo you can't trust those TED folks.
p116
aV"Find it yourself," they said.
p117
aVSo \u2014 (Laughter)
p118
aVAnd the feedback for the P.A. system is no help at all.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo now I present to you a challenge.
p121
aVSo if you'd all close your eyes for just a moment, okay?
p122
aVAnd you're going to learn a bit of flash sonar.
p123
aVI'm going to make a sound.
p124
aVI'm going to hold this panel in front  of me, but I'm not going to move it.
p125
aVJust listen to the sound for a moment.
p126
aVShhhhhhhhhh.
p127
aVOkay, nothing very interesting.
p128
aVNow, listen to what happens to that same exact sound
p129
aVwhen I move the panel.
p130
aVShhhhhhhhhhh.  (Pitch getting higher and lower)
p131
aVYou do not know the power of the dark side.
p132
aV(Laughter)
p133
aVI couldn't resist.
p134
aa(lp135
VOkay, now keep your eyes closed
p136
aVbecause, did you hear the difference?
p137
aVOkay. Now, let's be sure.
p138
aVFor your challenge,
p139
aVyou tell me, just say "now" when you hear the panel start to move.
p140
aVOkay? We'll relax into this.
p141
aa(lp142
VShhhhhhh.
p143
aa(lp144
VAudience: Now. Daniel Kish: Good. Excellent.
p145
aVOpen your eyes.
p146
aVAll right. So just a few centimeters,
p147
aVyou would notice the difference.
p148
aVYou've experienced sonar.
p149
aVYou'd all make great blind people. (Laughter)
p150
aVLet's have a look at what can happen
p151
aVwhen this activation process
p152
aVis given some time and attention.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Video) Juan Ruiz: It's like you guys can see with your eyes
p155
aVand we can see with our ears.
p156
aa(lp157
VBrian Bushway: It's not a matter of enjoying it more or less,
p158
aVit's about enjoying it differently.
p159
aa(lp160
VShawn Marsolais: It goes across. DK: Yeah.
p161
aa(lp162
VSM: And then it's gradually coming back down again.
p163
aa(lp164
VDK: Yes! SM: That's amazing.
p165
aVI can, like, see the car. Holy mother!
p166
aa(lp167
VJ. Louchart: I love being blind.
p168
aVIf I had the opportunity, honestly, I wouldn't go back to being sighted.
p169
aa(lp170
VJR: The bigger the goal, the more obstacles you'll face,
p171
aVand on the other side of that goal
p172
aVis victory.
p173
aV[In Italian]
p174
aV(Applause)
p175
aa(lp176
VDK: Now, do these people look terrified?
p177
aVNot so much.
p178
aVWe have delivered activation training
p179
aVto tens of thousands of blind and sighted people from all backgrounds
p180
aVin nearly 40 countries.
p181
aVWhen blind people learn to see,
p182
aVsighted people seem inspired
p183
aVto want to learn to see their way better, more clearly, with less fear,
p184
aVbecause this exemplifies the immense capacity within us all
p185
aVto navigate any type of challenge, through any form of darkness,
p186
aVto discoveries unimagined
p187
aVwhen we are activated.
p188
aa(lp189
VI wish you all a most activating journey.
p190
aa(lp191
VThank you very much.
p192
aa(lp193
V(Applause)
p194
aa(lp195
VChris Anderson: Daniel, my friend.
p196
aVAs I know you can see, it's a spectacular standing ovation at TED.
p197
aVThank you for an extraordinary talk.
p198
aVJust one more question about your world, your inner world that you construct.
p199
aVWe think that we have things in our world that you as a blind person don't have,
p200
aVbut what's your world like?
p201
aVWhat do you have that we don't have?
p202
aa(lp203
VDK: Three hundred and sixty-degree view,
p204
aVso my sonar works about as well behind me as it does in front of me.
p205
aVIt works around corners.
p206
aVIt works through surfaces.
p207
aVGenerally, it's kind of a fuzzy three-dimensional geometry.
p208
aVOne of my students, who has now become an instructor,
p209
aVwhen he lost his vision, after a few months
p210
aVhe was sitting in his three story house
p211
aVand he realized that he could hear everything going on throughout the house:
p212
aVconversations, people in the kitchen, people in the bathroom,
p213
aVseveral floors away, several walls away.
p214
aVHe said it was something like having x-ray vision.
p215
aa(lp216
VCA: What do you picture that you're in right now?
p217
aVHow do you picture this theater?
p218
aa(lp219
VDK: Lots of loudspeakers, quite frankly.
p220
aVIt's interesting.  When people make a sound,
p221
aVwhen they laugh, when they fidget, when they take a drink or blow their nose
p222
aVor whatever, I hear everything.
p223
aVI hear every little movement that every single person makes.
p224
aVNone of it really escapes my attention,
p225
aVand then, from a sonar perspective,
p226
aVthe size of the room, the curvature  of the audience around the stage,
p227
aVit's the height of the room.
p228
aVLike I say, it's all that kind  of three-dimensional surface geometry
p229
aVall around me.
p230
aa(lp231
VCA: Well, Daniel, you have done a spectacular job
p232
aVof helping us all see the world in a different way.
p233
aVThanks so much for that, truly. DK: Thank you.
