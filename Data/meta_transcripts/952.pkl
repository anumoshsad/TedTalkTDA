VI am a cultural omnivore,
p4
aVone whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an iPod \u2014
p5
aVan iPod that contains Wagner and Mozart,
p6
aVpop diva Christina Aguilera,
p7
aVcountry singer Josh Turner,
p8
aVgangsta rap artist Kirk Franklin,
p9
aVconcerti, symphonies and more and more.
p10
aVI'm a voracious reader,
p11
aVa reader who deals with Ian McEwan down to Stephanie Meyer.
p12
aVI have read the Twilight tetralogy.
p13
aVAnd one who lives for my home theater,
p14
aVa home theater where I devour DVDs, video on demand
p15
aVand a lot of television.
p16
aVFor me, "Law & Order: SVU," Tina Fey and "30 Rock"
p17
aVand "Judge Judy" \u2014
p18
aV"The people are real, the cases are real, the rulings are final."
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VNow, I'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions,
p23
aVespecially my passion for "Judge Judy,"
p24
aVand you'd fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us,
p25
aVbut I'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life,
p26
aVa passion for the live professional performing arts,
p27
aVperforming arts that represent the orchestral repertoire, yes,
p28
aVbut jazz as well, modern dance, opera,
p29
aVtheater and more and more and more.
p30
aa(lp31
VFrankly, it's a sector that many of us who work in the field
p32
aVworry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology.
p33
aVWhile we initially heralded the Internet as the fantastic new marketing device
p34
aVthat was going to solve all our problems,
p35
aVwe now realize that the Internet is, if anything,
p36
aVtoo effective in that regard.
p37
aVDepending on who you read, an arts organization
p38
aVor an artist, who tries to attract the attention
p39
aVof a potential single ticket buyer,
p40
aVnow competes with between three and 5,000 different marketing messages
p41
aVa typical citizen sees every single day.
p42
aVWe now know, in fact,
p43
aVthat technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time.
p44
aVFive years ago,
p45
aVGen Xers spent 20.7 hours online and TV, the majority on TV.
p46
aVGen Yers spent even more \u2014
p47
aV23.8 hours, the majority online.
p48
aVAnd now, a typical university-entering student arrives at college
p49
aValready having spent 20,000 hours online
p50
aVand an additional 10,000 hours playing video games \u2014
p51
aVa stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context
p52
aVwhere video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined.
p53
aa(lp54
VMoreover, we're afraid that technology
p55
aVhas altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption.
p56
aVThanks to the Internet,
p57
aVwe believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it,
p58
aVdelivered to our own doorstep.
p59
aVWe can shop at three in the morning or eight at night,
p60
aVordering jeans tailor-made for our unique body types.
p61
aVExpectations of personalization and customization
p62
aVthat the live performing arts \u2014
p63
aVwhich have set curtain times, set venues,
p64
aVattendant inconveniences of travel, parking and the like \u2014
p65
aVsimply cannot meet.
p66
aVAnd we're all acutely aware:
p67
aVwhat's it going to mean in the future
p68
aVwhen we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars
p69
aVfor a symphony, opera or ballet ticket,
p70
aVwhen that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet
p71
aV24 hours a day for 99 cents a song or for free?
p72
aVThese are enormous questions for those of us that work in this terrain.
p73
aVBut as particular as they feel to us, we know we're not alone.
p74
aa(lp75
VAll of us are engaged
p76
aVin a seismic, fundamental realignment of culture and communications,
p77
aVa realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry,
p78
aVthe magazine industry, the book and publishing industry and more.
p79
aVSaddled in the performing arts as we are, by antiquated union agreements
p80
aVthat inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming,
p81
aVlocked into large facilities that were designed to ossify
p82
aVthe ideal relationship between artist and audience
p83
aVmost appropriate to the 19th century
p84
aVand locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues,
p85
aVwhere we charge exorbitant prices.
p86
aVMany of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records
p87
aVand ask ourselves, "Are we next?"
p88
aVEveryone I talk to in performing arts resonates to the words of Adrienne Rich,
p89
aVwho, in "Dreams of a Common Language," wrote,
p90
aV"We are out in a country that has no language, no laws.
p91
aVWhatever we do together is pure invention.
p92
aVThe maps they gave us are out of date by years."
p93
aVAnd for those of you who love the arts,
p94
aVaren't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day?
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
V(Applause)
p99
aa(lp100
VNow, rather than saying that we're on the brink of our own annihilation,
p101
aVI prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation,
p102
aVa reformation like the religious Reformation of the 16th century.
p103
aVThe arts reformation, like the religious Reformation,
p104
aVis spurred in part by technology,
p105
aVwith indeed, the printing press really leading the charge
p106
aVon the religious Reformation.
p107
aVBoth reformations were predicated on fractious discussion,
p108
aVinternal self-doubt
p109
aVand massive realignment of antiquated business models.
p110
aVAnd at heart, both reformations, I think, were asking the questions:
p111
aVwho's entitled to practice?
p112
aVHow are they entitled to practice?
p113
aVAnd indeed, do we need anyone to intermediate for us
p114
aVin order to have an experience with a spiritual divine?
p115
aa(lp116
VChris Anderson, someone I trust you all know,
p117
aVeditor in chief of Wired magazine and author of The Long Tail,
p118
aVreally was the first, for me, to nail a lot of this.
p119
aVHe wrote a long time ago, you know,
p120
aVthanks to the invention of the Internet, web technology, minicams and more,
p121
aVthe means of artistic production have been democratized
p122
aVfor the first time in all of human history.
p123
aVIn the 1930s, if any of you wanted to make a movie,
p124
aVyou had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO,
p125
aVbecause who could afford a movie set
p126
aVand lighting equipment and editing equipment
p127
aVand scoring, and more?
p128
aVAnd now who in this room doesn't know a 14 year-old
p129
aVhard at work on her second, third, or fourth movie?
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VSimilarly, the means of artistic distribution
p134
aVhave been democratized for the first time in human history.
p135
aVAgain, in the '30s, Warner Brothers, RKO did that for you.
p136
aVNow, go to YouTube, Facebook;
p137
aVyou have worldwide distribution
p138
aVwithout leaving the privacy of your own bedroom.
p139
aa(lp140
VThis double impact is occasioning
p141
aVa massive redefinition of the cultural market,
p142
aVa time when anyone is a potential author.
p143
aVFrankly, what we're seeing now in this environment
p144
aVis a massive time, when the entire world is changing
p145
aVas we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting.
p146
aVBut the number of arts participants,
p147
aVpeople who write poetry, who sing songs, who perform in church choirs,
p148
aVis exploding beyond our wildest imaginations.
p149
aVThis group, others have called the pro-ams,
p150
aVamateur artists doing work at a professional level.
p151
aVYou see them on YouTube, in dance competitions,
p152
aVfilm festivals and more.
p153
aVThey are radically expanding
p154
aVour notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary,
p155
aVwhile they are challenging and undermining
p156
aVthe cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions.
p157
aVUltimately, we now live in a world defined not by consumption,
p158
aVbut by participation.
p159
aa(lp160
VBut I want to be clear,
p161
aVjust as the religious Reformation did not spell the end
p162
aVto the formal Church or to the priesthood;
p163
aVI believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance.
p164
aVThey currently are the best opportunities
p165
aVfor artists to have lives of economic dignity \u2014
p166
aVnot opulence, of dignity.
p167
aVAnd they are the places where artists
p168
aVwho deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources
p169
aVwill find a home.
p170
aVBut to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community
p171
aVis, by far, too shortsighted.
p172
aVAnd indeed, while we've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional,
p173
aVthe single most exciting development in the last five to 10 years
p174
aVhas been the rise of the professional hybrid artist,
p175
aVthe professional artist who works,
p176
aVnot primarily in the concert hall or on the stage;
p177
aVbut most frequently around women's rights, or human rights,
p178
aVor on global warming issues or AIDS relief for more \u2014
p179
aVnot out of economic necessity,
p180
aVbut out of a deep, organic conviction
p181
aVthat the work that she or he is called to do
p182
aVcannot be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment.
p183
aa(lp184
VToday's dance world is not defined solely
p185
aVby the Royal Winnipeg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada,
p186
aVbut by Liz Lerman's Dance Exchange \u2014
p187
aVa multi-generational, professional dance company,
p188
aVwhose dancers range in age from 18 to 82,
p189
aVand who work with genomic scientists to embody the DNA strand
p190
aVand with nuclear physicists at CERN.
p191
aVToday's professional theater community
p192
aVis defined, not only the Shaw and Stratford Festivals,
p193
aVbut by the Cornerstone Theater of Los Angeles \u2014
p194
aVa collective of artists that after 9/11,
p195
aVbrought together 10 different religious communities \u2014
p196
aVthe Baha'i, the Catholic,
p197
aVthe Muslim, the Jewish,
p198
aVeven the Native American
p199
aVand the gay and lesbian communities of faith,
p200
aVhelping them create their own individual plays
p201
aVand one massive play,
p202
aVwhere they explored the differences in their faith
p203
aVand found commonality
p204
aVas an important first step toward cross-community healing.
p205
aVToday's performers, like Rhodessa Jones, work in women's prisons,
p206
aVhelping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration,
p207
aVwhile today's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs
p208
aVto find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more.
p209
aVAnd indeed, I think, rather than being annihilated,
p210
aVthe performing arts are poised on the brink of a time
p211
aVwhen we will be more important than we have ever been.
p212
aa(lp213
VYou know, we've said for a long time,
p214
aVwe are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town.
p215
aVAnd absolutely \u2014
p216
aVI hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community
p217
aVgenerates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy,
p218
aVdollars spent in restaurants or on parking,
p219
aVat the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes,
p220
aVthe piano tuner who tunes the instruments, and more.
p221
aVBut the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward,
p222
aVespecially in industries we can't even imagine yet,
p223
aVjust as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries,
p224
aVwhich few, if any of us, could have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago.
p225
aVBusiness leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence,
p226
aVthe ability to listen deeply,
p227
aVto have empathy,
p228
aVto articulate change, to motivate others \u2014
p229
aVthe very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter.
p230
aa(lp231
VEspecially now,
p232
aVas we all must confront the fallacy of a market-only orientation,
p233
aVuninformed by social conscience;
p234
aVwe must seize and celebrate the power of the arts
p235
aVto shape our individual and national characters,
p236
aVand especially characters of the young people,
p237
aVwho all too often are subjected to bombardment of sensation,
p238
aVrather than digested experience.
p239
aVUltimately, especially now in this world,
p240
aVwhere we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws,
p241
aVin reality TV that thrives on humiliation,
p242
aVand in a context of analysis,
p243
aVwhere the thing we hear most repeatedly, day in, day out in the United States,
p244
aVin every train station, every bus station, every plane station is,
p245
aV"Ladies and gentlemen,
p246
aVplease report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals
p247
aVto the authorities nearest to you,"
p248
aVwhen all of these ways we are encouraged
p249
aVto view our fellow human being with hostility and fear
p250
aVand contempt and suspicion.
p251
aa(lp252
VThe arts, whatever they do, whenever they call us together,
p253
aVinvite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity.
p254
aVGod knows, if we ever needed that capacity in human history,
p255
aVwe need it now.
p256
aVYou know, we're bound together,
p257
aVnot, I think by technology, entertainment and design,
p258
aVbut by common cause.
p259
aVWe work to promote healthy vibrant societies,
p260
aVto ameliorate human suffering,
p261
aVto promote a more thoughtful, substantive, empathic world order.
p262
aa(lp263
VI salute all of you as activists in that quest
p264
aVand urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work,
p265
aVwhatever your purpose may be.
p266
aVI promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation
p267
aVis stretched out in friendship for now and years to come.
p268
aVAnd I thank you for your kindness and your patience
p269
aVin listening to me this afternoon.
p270
aa(lp271
VThank you, and Godspeed.
