VI'm actually here
p4
aVto make a challenge to people.
p5
aVI know there have been many challenges made to people.
p6
aVThe one I'm going to make
p7
aVis that it is time for us to reclaim
p8
aVwhat peace really means.
p9
aVPeace is not "Kumbaya, my Lord."
p10
aVPeace is not the dove and the rainbow \u2014
p11
aVas lovely as they are.
p12
aVWhen I see the symbols
p13
aVof the rainbow and the dove,
p14
aVI think of personal serenity.
p15
aVI think of meditation.
p16
aVI do not think
p17
aVabout what I consider to be peace,
p18
aVwhich is sustainable peace
p19
aVwith justice and equality.
p20
aVIt is a sustainable peace
p21
aVin which the majority of people
p22
aVon this planet
p23
aVhave access to enough resources
p24
aVto live dignified lives,
p25
aVwhere these people have enough access
p26
aVto education
p27
aVand health care,
p28
aVso that they can live in freedom from want
p29
aVand freedom from fear.
p30
aVThis is called human security.
p31
aVAnd I am not a complete pacifist
p32
aVlike some of my really, really heavy-duty,
p33
aVnon-violent friends,
p34
aVlike Mairead McGuire.
p35
aVI understand that humans
p36
aVare so "messed up" \u2014
p37
aVto use a nice word,
p38
aVbecause I promised my mom
p39
aVI'd stop using the F-bomb in public.
p40
aVAnd I'm trying harder and harder.
p41
aVMom, I'm really trying.
p42
aa(lp43
VWe need a little bit of police;
p44
aVwe need a little bit of military,
p45
aVbut for defense.
p46
aVWe need to redefine
p47
aVwhat makes us secure
p48
aVin this world.
p49
aVIt is not arming our country
p50
aVto the teeth.
p51
aVIt is not getting other countries
p52
aVto arm themselves to the teeth
p53
aVwith the weapons that we produce
p54
aVand we sell them.
p55
aVIt is using that money more rationally
p56
aVto make the countries of the world secure,
p57
aVto make the people of the world secure.
p58
aVI was thinking about
p59
aVthe recent ongoings
p60
aVin Congress,
p61
aVwhere the president is offering
p62
aV8.4 billion dollars
p63
aVto try to get the START vote.
p64
aVI certainly support the START vote.
p65
aVBut he's offering 84 billion dollars
p66
aVfor the modernizing
p67
aVof nuclear weapons.
p68
aVDo you know the figure that the U.N. talks about
p69
aVfor fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals
p70
aVis 80 billion dollars?
p71
aVJust that little bit of money,
p72
aVwhich to me, I wish it was in my bank account \u2014
p73
aVit's not, but ...
p74
aVIn global terms, it's a little bit of money.
p75
aVBut it's going to modernize weapons
p76
aVwe do not need
p77
aVand will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime,
p78
aVunless we get up off our ...
p79
aVand take action to make it happen,
p80
aVunless we begin to believe
p81
aVthat all of the things that we've been hearing about
p82
aVin these last two days
p83
aVare elements of what come together
p84
aVto make human security.
p85
aVIt is saving the tigers.
p86
aVIt is stopping the tar sands.
p87
aVIt is having access
p88
aVto medical equipment
p89
aVthat can actually tell who does have cancer.
p90
aVIt is all of those things.
p91
aVIt is using our money for all of those things.
p92
aVIt is about action.
p93
aa(lp94
VI was in Hiroshima
p95
aVa couple of weeks ago,
p96
aVand His Holiness \u2014
p97
aVwe're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city,
p98
aVand there were about eight of us Nobel laureates.
p99
aVAnd he's a bad guy. He's like a bad kid in church.
p100
aVWe're staring at everybody, waiting our turn to speak,
p101
aVand he leans over to me, and he says,
p102
aV"Jody, I'm a Buddhist monk."
p103
aVI said, "Yes, Your Holiness.
p104
aVYour robe gives it away."
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aVHe said, "You know
p107
aVthat I kind of like meditation, and I pray."
p108
aVI said, "That's good. That's good.
p109
aVWe need that in the world.
p110
aVI don't follow that, but that's cool."
p111
aVAnd he says, "But I have become skeptical.
p112
aVI do not believe
p113
aVthat meditation and prayer
p114
aVwill change this world.
p115
aVI think what we need
p116
aVis action."
p117
aVHis Holiness, in his robes,
p118
aVis my new action hero.
p119
aa(lp120
VI spoke with Aung Sun Suu Kyi
p121
aVa couple of days ago.
p122
aVAs most of you know,
p123
aVshe's a hero for democracy in her country, Burma.
p124
aVYou probably also know
p125
aVthat she has spent 15 of the last 20 years
p126
aVimprisoned for her efforts
p127
aVto bring about democracy.
p128
aVShe was just released a couple of weeks ago,
p129
aVand we're very concerned to see how long she will be free,
p130
aVbecause she is already out in the streets in Rangoon,
p131
aVagitating for change.
p132
aVShe is already out in the streets, working with the party
p133
aVto try to rebuild it.
p134
aVBut I talked to her for a range of issues.
p135
aVBut one thing that I want to say,
p136
aVbecause it's similar to what His Holiness said.
p137
aVShe said, "You know, we have a long road to go
p138
aVto finally get democracy in my country.
p139
aVBut I don't believe in hope
p140
aVwithout endeavor.
p141
aVI don't believe in the hope of change,
p142
aVunless we take action
p143
aVto make it so."
p144
aa(lp145
VHere's another woman hero of mine.
p146
aVShe's my friend, Dr. Shirin Ebadi,
p147
aVthe first Muslim woman
p148
aVto receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
p149
aVShe has been in exile
p150
aVfor the last year and a half.
p151
aVYou ask her where she lives \u2014 where does she live in exile?
p152
aVShe says the airports of the world.
p153
aVShe is traveling because she was out of the country
p154
aVat the time of the elections.
p155
aVAnd instead of going home,
p156
aVshe conferred with all the other women that she works with,
p157
aVwho said to her, "Stay out. We need you out.
p158
aVWe need to be able to talk to you out there,
p159
aVso that you can give the message
p160
aVof what's happening here."
p161
aVA year and a half \u2014
p162
aVshe's out speaking
p163
aVon behalf of the other women in her country.
p164
aa(lp165
VWangari Maathai \u2014
p166
aV2004 Peace laureate.
p167
aVThey call her the "Tree Lady,"
p168
aVbut she's more than the Tree Lady.
p169
aVWorking for peace
p170
aVis very creative.
p171
aVIt's hard work every day.
p172
aVWhen she was planting those trees,
p173
aVI don't think most people understand
p174
aVthat, at the same time,
p175
aVshe was using the action
p176
aVof getting people together to plant those trees
p177
aVto talk about how to overcome
p178
aVthe authoritarian government in her country.
p179
aVPeople could not gather
p180
aVwithout getting busted and taken to jail.
p181
aVBut if they were together planting trees for the environment,
p182
aVit was okay \u2014
p183
aVcreativity.
p184
aVBut it's not just iconic women
p185
aVlike Shirin,
p186
aVlike Aung Sun Suu Kyi, like Wangari Maathai \u2014
p187
aVit is other women in the world
p188
aVwho are also struggling together
p189
aVto change this world.
p190
aa(lp191
VThe Women's League of Burma,
p192
aV11 individual organizations of Burmese women
p193
aVcame together because there's strength in numbers.
p194
aVWorking together is what changes our world.
p195
aVThe Million Signatures Campaign
p196
aVof women inside Burma
p197
aVworking together to change human rights,
p198
aVto bring democracy to that country.
p199
aVWhen one is arrested and taken to prison,
p200
aVanother one comes out and joins the movement,
p201
aVrecognizing that if they work together,
p202
aVthey will ultimately bring change
p203
aVin their own country.
p204
aa(lp205
VMairead McGuire in the middle,
p206
aVBetty Williams on the right-hand side \u2014
p207
aVbringing peace to Northern Ireland.
p208
aVI'll tell you the quick story.
p209
aVAn IRA driver was shot,
p210
aVand his car plowed into people
p211
aVon the side of the street.
p212
aVThere was a mother and three children.
p213
aVThe children were killed on the spot.
p214
aVIt was Mairead's sister.
p215
aVInstead of giving in
p216
aVto grief, depression, defeat
p217
aVin the face of that violence,
p218
aVMairead hooked up with Betty \u2014
p219
aVa staunch Protestant and a staunch Catholic \u2014
p220
aVand they took to the streets
p221
aVto say, "No more violence."
p222
aVAnd they were able to get
p223
aVtens of thousands of, primarily, women, some men,
p224
aVin the streets to bring about change.
p225
aVAnd they have been
p226
aVpart of what brought peace to Northern Ireland,
p227
aVand they're still working on it,
p228
aVbecause there's still a lot more to do.
p229
aa(lp230
VThis is Rigoberta Menchu Tum.
p231
aVShe also received the Peace Prize.
p232
aVShe is now running for president.
p233
aVShe is educating the indigenous people of her country
p234
aVabout what it means to be a democracy,
p235
aVabout how you bring democracy to the country,
p236
aVabout educating, about how to vote \u2014
p237
aVbut that democracy is not just about voting;
p238
aVit's about being an active citizen.
p239
aa(lp240
VThat's what I got stuck doing \u2014
p241
aVthe landmine campaign.
p242
aVOne of the things that made this campaign work
p243
aVis because we grew from two NGOs
p244
aVto thousands
p245
aVin 90 countries around the world,
p246
aVworking together in common cause to ban landmines.
p247
aVSome of the people who worked in our campaign
p248
aVcould only work maybe an hour a month.
p249
aVThey could maybe volunteer that much.
p250
aVThere were others, like myself,
p251
aVwho were full-time.
p252
aVBut it was the actions, together, of all of us
p253
aVthat brought about that change.
p254
aa(lp255
VIn my view, what we need today
p256
aVis people getting up
p257
aVand taking action
p258
aVto reclaim the meaning of peace.
p259
aVIt's not a dirty word.
p260
aVIt's hard work every single day.
p261
aVAnd if each of us
p262
aVwho cares about the different things we care about
p263
aVgot up off our butts
p264
aVand volunteered
p265
aVas much time as we could,
p266
aVwe would change this world,
p267
aVwe would save this world.
p268
aVAnd we can't wait for the other guy. We have to do it ourselves.
p269
