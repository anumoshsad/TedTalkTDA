p8
aa(lp9
VThank you!
p10
aa(lp11
V(Applause continues)
p12
aa(lp13
VThank you very much.
p14
aVLike the speaker before me \u2014 I am a TED virgin, I guess.
p15
aVI'm also the first time here, and ...
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VI don't know what to say!
p20
aa(lp21
V(Applause)
p22
aa(lp23
VI'm really happy that Mr. Anderson invited me.
p24
aVI'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone.
p25
aVAnd the song that I just played was by Josef Hofmann.
p26
aVIt's called "Kaleidoscope."
p27
aVAnd Hofmann is a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century,
p28
aVand he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time.
p29
aa(lp30
VI have another piece that I'd like to play for you.
p31
aVIt's called "Abegg Variations," by Robert Schumann,
p32
aVa German 19th-century composer.
p33
aVThe name "Abegg" is actually A-B-E-G-G,
p34
aVand that's the main theme in the melody.
p35
aV(Plays the notes A, B, E, G and G)
p36
aVThat comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends.
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
VBut he wrote that for his wife.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VSo actually, if you listen carefully,
p45
aVthere are supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme.
p46
aVIt's written around 1834,
p47
aVso even though it's old, I hope you'll like it.
p48

V(Music ends)
p52
aa(lp53
V(Applause)
p54
aa(lp55
VNow comes the part that I hate.
p56
aVWell, because Mr. Anderson told me
p57
aVthat this session is called "Sync and Flow,"
p58
aVI was wondering, "What do I know that these geniuses don't?"
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VSo, I'll talk about musical composition,
p63
aVeven though I don't know where to start.
p64
aa(lp65
VHow do I compose?
p66
aVI think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose.
p67
aVWhat I do first is, I make a lot of little musical ideas
p68
aVyou can just improvise here at the piano \u2014
p69
aVand I choose one of those to become my main theme, my main melody,
p70
aVlike the Abegg that you just heard.
p71
aVAnd once I choose my main theme, I have to decide:
p72
aVOut of all the styles in music, what kind of style do I want?
p73
aVAnd this year, I composed a Romantic style.
p74
aVSo for inspiration, I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky
p75
aVand all the great Romantic composers.
p76
aa(lp77
VNext, I make the structure of the entire piece with my teachers.
p78
aVThey help me plan out the whole piece.
p79
aVAnd then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas,
p80
aVbecause then you have to think.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd then, when the piece takes somewhat of a solified form \u2014
p85
aVsolidified, excuse me \u2014 solidified form,
p86
aVyou're supposed to actually polish the piece, polish the details,
p87
aVand then polish the overall performance of the composition.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd another thing that I enjoy doing is drawing.
p90
aVDrawing, because I like to draw, you know, Japanese anime art.
p91
aVI think that's a craze among teens right now.
p92
aVAnd once I realized it,
p93
aVthere's a parallel between creating music and creating art,
p94
aVbecause for your motive, or your little initial idea for your drawing,
p95
aVit's your character \u2014 you want to decide who you want to draw,
p96
aVor if you want to draw an original character.
p97
aVAnd then you want to decide: How are you going to draw the character?
p98
aVLike, am I going to use one page? Am I going to draw it on the computer?
p99
aVAm I going to use a two-page spread like a comic book?
p100
aVFor a more grandiose effect, I guess.
p101
aVAnd then you have to do the initial sketch of the character,
p102
aVwhich is like your structure of a piece,
p103
aVand then you add pen and pencil, and whatever details that you need \u2014
p104
aVthat's polishing the drawing.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind,
p107
aVbecause I know I'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted.
p108
aVSo if I'm trying to do homework and I don't feel like it,
p109
aVI'll try to draw or, you know, waste my time.
p110
aVAnd then what happens is, sometimes I absolutely can't draw
p111
aVor I can't compose at all,
p112
aVand then it's like there's too much on your mind.
p113
aVYou can't focus on what you're supposed to do.
p114
aVAnd sometimes, if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it,
p115
aVyou'll get something out of it, but it doesn't come naturally.
p116
aa(lp117
VWhat happens is, if something magical happens,
p118
aVif something natural happens to you,
p119
aVyou're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly,
p120
aVand then that's what I consider "flow,"
p121
aVbecause that's when everything clicks and you're able to do anything.
p122
aVYou feel like you're on top of your game and you can do anything you want.
p123
aa(lp124
VI'm not going to play my own composition today because,
p125
aValthough I did finish it, it's way too long.
p126
aVInstead, I'd like to try something called "improvisation."
p127
aVI have here seven note cards,
p128
aVone with each note of the musical alphabet.
p129
aVAnd I'd like someone to come up here and choose five \u2014
p130
aVanyone to come up here and choose five \u2014
p131
aVand then I can make it into some sort of melody,
p132
aVand I'll improvise it.
p133
aVWow. A volunteer, yay!
p134

VGoldie Hawn: Thank you. Choose five?
p142
aa(lp143
VJL: Yes, five cards. Any five cards.
p144
aa(lp145
VGH: OK, one. JL: OK.
p146
aa(lp147
VGH: Two. JL: Yes.
p148
aa(lp149
VGH: Three.
p150
aa(lp151
VGH: Oh, D and F \u2014 too familiar.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
VJL: One more. GH: OK. "E" for "effort."
p156
aa(lp157
VJL: Would you mind reading them out in the order that you chose them?
p158
aa(lp159
VGH: OK \u2014 C, G, B, A and E.
p160
aa(lp161
VJL: Thank you very much!
p162
aa(lp163
VGH: You're welcome. And what about these?
p164
aa(lp165
VJL: I won't use them. Thank you!
p166
aa(lp167
V(Applause)
p168
aa(lp169
VNow, she chose C, G, B, A, E.
p170
aVI'm going to try to put that in some sort of order.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Plays notes)
p173
aa(lp174
VOK, that's nice.
p175
aVSo, I'm going to have a moment to think,
p176
aVand I'll try to make something out of it.
