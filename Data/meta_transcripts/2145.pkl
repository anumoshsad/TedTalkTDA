VTen years ago,
p4
aVI got a phone call that changed my life.
p5
aVAt the time, I was  cardiologist at UCLA,
p6
aVspecializing in cardiac  imaging techniques.
p7
aVThe call came from a veterinarian at the Los Angeles Zoo.
p8
aVAn elderly female chimpanzee
p9
aVhad woken up with a facial droop
p10
aVand the veterinarians were worried that she'd had a stroke.
p11
aVThey asked if I'd  come to the zoo
p12
aVand image the animal's heart
p13
aVto look for a possible cardiac cause.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, to be clear, North American zoos are staffed
p16
aVby highly qualified,  board-certified veterinarians
p17
aVwho take outstanding  care of their animal patients.
p18
aVBut occasionally, they do reach into  the human medical community,
p19
aVparticularly for some  speciality consultation,
p20
aVand I was one of the lucky physicians who was invited in to help.
p21
aVI had a chance to rule out a stroke in this chimpanzee
p22
aVand make sure that this gorilla  didn't have a torn aorta,
p23
aVevaluate this macaw for a heart murmur,
p24
aVmake sure that this California sea lion's paricardium wasn't inflamed,
p25
aVand in this picture, I'm listening to the heart of a lion
p26
aVafter a lifesaving,  collaborative procedure
p27
aVwith veterinarians and physicians
p28
aVwhere we drained 700 cc's of  fluid from the sac
p29
aVin which this lion's  heart was contained.
p30
aVAnd this procedure, which I have done on many human patients,
p31
aVwas identical, with the exception of that paw and that tail.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow most of the time, I was working at UCLA Medical Center with physicians,
p34
aVdiscussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments
p35
aVfor my human patients,
p36
aVbut some of the time, I was working at the Los Angeles Zoo
p37
aVwith veterinarians, discussing  symptoms and diagnoses and treatments
p38
aVfor their animal patients.
p39
aVAnd occasionally, on  the very same day,
p40
aVI went on rounds at  UCLA Medical Center
p41
aVand at the Los Angeles Zoo.
p42
aVAnd here's what started coming into very clear focus for me.
p43
aVPhysicians and veterinarians were essentially taking care
p44
aVof the same disorders in their  animal and human patients:
p45
aVcongestive heart failure, brain tumors,
p46
aVleukemia, diabetes,  arthritis, ALS, breast cancer,
p47
aVeven psychiatric syndromes like depression, anxiety,
p48
aVcompulsions, eating disorders and self-injury.
p49
aa(lp50
VNow, I've got a confession to make.
p51
aVEven though I studied comparative physiology and evolutionary biology
p52
aVas an undergrad \u2014
p53
aVI had even written my senior  thesis on Darwinian theory \u2014
p54
aVlearning about the  significant overlap
p55
aVbetween the disorders of  animals and humans,
p56
aVit came as a much needed  wake-up call for me.
p57
aVSo I started wondering, with all of these overlaps,
p58
aVhow was it that I had never thought to ask a veterinarian,
p59
aVor consult the veterinary literature,
p60
aVfor insights into one  of my human patients?
p61
aVWhy had I never, nor had any of my  physician friends and colleagues
p62
aVwhom I asked, ever attended  a veterinary conference?
p63
aVFor that matter, why was  any of this a surprise?
p64
aVI mean, look, every single physician accepts some biological connection
p65
aVbetween animals and humans.
p66
aVEvery medication that we prescribe or that we've taken ourselves
p67
aVor we've given to our families
p68
aVhas first been tested on an animal.
p69
aa(lp70
VBut there's something very different
p71
aVabout giving an animal a  medication or a human disease
p72
aVand the animal developing  congestive heart failure
p73
aVor diabetes or breast cancer  on their own.
p74
aVNow, maybe some of the surprise
p75
aVcomes from the increasing separation in our world
p76
aVbetween the urban and the nonurban.
p77
aVYou know, we hear about these city kids
p78
aVwho think that wool grows on trees
p79
aVor that cheese comes from a plant.
p80
aVWell, today's human hospitals,
p81
aVincreasingly, are turning into these gleaming cathedrals of technology.
p82
aVAnd this creates a psychological distance between the human patients
p83
aVwho are being treated there
p84
aVand animal patients who are living in oceans
p85
aVand farms and jungles.
p86
aa(lp87
VBut I think there's an  even deeper reason.
p88
aVPhysicians and scientists, we accept intellectually that our species,
p89
aVHomo sapiens, is merely  one species,
p90
aVno more unique or special than any other.
p91
aVBut in our hearts, we don't  completely believe that.
p92
aVI feel it myself when I'm  listening to Mozart
p93
aVor looking at pictures of the  Mars Rover on my MacBook.
p94
aVI feel that tug of  human exceptionalism,
p95
aVeven as I recognize the  scientifically isolating cost
p96
aVof seeing ourselves as a superior species, apart.
p97
aVWell, I'm trying these days.
p98
aVWhen I see a human patient now, I always ask,
p99
aVwhat do the animal doctors know about this problem that I don't know?
p100
aVAnd, might I be taking better  care of my human patient
p101
aVif I saw them as a human animal patient?
p102
aa(lp103
VHere are a few examples of the  kind of exciting connections
p104
aVthat this kind of  thinking has led me to.
p105
aVFear-induced heart failure.
p106
aVAround the year 2000,
p107
aVhuman cardiologists "discovered" emotionally induced heart failure.
p108
aVIt was described in a gambling father  who had lost his life's savings
p109
aVwith a roll of the dice,
p110
aVin a bride who'd been left at the alter.
p111
aVBut it turns out, this  "new" human diagnosis
p112
aVwas neither new, nor was it uniquely human.
p113
aVVeterinarians had been diagnosing,  treating and even preventing
p114
aVemotionally induced symptoms in animals
p115
aVranging from monkeys to flamingos, from to deer to rabbits,
p116
aVsince the 1970s.
p117
aVHow many human lives  might have been saved
p118
aVif this veterinary knowledge had been put into the hands
p119
aVof E.R. docs and cardiologists?
p120
aa(lp121
VSelf-injury.
p122
aVSome human patients  harm themselves.
p123
aVSome pluck out patches of hair,
p124
aVothers actually cut themselves.
p125
aVSome animal patients  also harm themselves.
p126
aVThere are birds that  pluck out feathers.
p127
aVThere are stallions that repetitively bite their flanks until they bleed.
p128
aVBut veterinarians have very specific and very effective ways
p129
aVof treating and even preventing self-injury
p130
aVin their self-injuring animals.
p131
aVShouldn't this veterinary knowledge be put into the hands
p132
aVof psychotherapists and  parents and patients
p133
aVstruggling with self-injury?
p134
aa(lp135
VPostpartum depression and  postpartum psychosis.
p136
aVSometimes, soon after giving birth,
p137
aVsome women become depressed,
p138
aVand sometimes they become seriously  depressed and even psychotic.
p139
aVThey may neglect their newborn,
p140
aVand in some extreme cases,
p141
aVeven harm the child.
p142
aVEquine veterinarians also know that occasionally,
p143
aVa mare, soon after giving birth,
p144
aVwill neglect the foal, refusing to nurse,
p145
aVand in some instances, kick the foal, even to death.
p146
aVBut veterinarians have devised
p147
aVan intervention to deal with this foal rejection syndrome
p148
aVthat involves increasing  oxytocin in the mare.
p149
aVOxytocin is the bonding hormone,
p150
aVand this leads to renewed interest,
p151
aVon the part of the mare, in her foal.
p152
aVShouldn't this information
p153
aVbe put into the hands of ob/gyn's
p154
aVand family doctors and patients
p155
aVwho are struggling with postpartum depression and psychosis?
p156
aa(lp157
VWell, despite all of this promise,
p158
aVunfortunately the gulf between our fields remains large.
p159
aVTo explain it, I'm afraid I'm going  to have to air some dirty laundry.
p160
aVSome physicians can be real snobs
p161
aVabout doctors who are not M.D.'s.
p162
aVI'm talking about dentists and  optometrists and psychologists,
p163
aVbut maybe especially animal doctors.
p164
aVOf course, most physicians don't realize that it is harder
p165
aVto get into vet school these days than medical school,
p166
aVand that when we go  to medical school,
p167
aVwe learn everything  there is to know
p168
aVabout one species, Homo sapiens,
p169
aVbut veterinarians need to learn about health and disease
p170
aVin mammals, amphibians, reptiles, fish and birds.
p171
aVSo I don't blame the vets for feeling annoyed
p172
aVby my profession's condescension and ignorance.
p173
aVBut here's one from the vets:
p174
aVWhat do you call a veterinarian
p175
aVwho can only take  care of one species?
p176
aVA physician. (Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VClosing the gap has become  a passion for me,
p179
aVand I'm doing this  through programs
p180
aVlike Darwin on Rounds at UCLA,
p181
aVwhere we're bringing animal experts  and evolutionary biologists
p182
aVand embedding them on our medical teams
p183
aVwith our interns and our residents.
p184
aVAnd through Zoobiquity conferences,
p185
aVwhere we bring medical schools  together with veterinary schools
p186
aVfor collabortive discussions
p187
aVof the shared diseases and disorders
p188
aVof animal and human patients.
p189
aVAt Zoobiquity conferences,
p190
aVparticipants learn how treating breast cancer in a tiger
p191
aVcan help us better treat breast cancer
p192
aVin a kindergarten teacher;
p193
aVhow understanding polycystic overies in a Holstein cow
p194
aVcan help us better take care
p195
aVof a dance instructor  with painful periods;
p196
aVand how better understanding the  treatment of separation anxiety
p197
aVin a high-strung Sheltie
p198
aVcan help an anxious young child struggling with his first days of school.
p199
aa(lp200
VIn the United States and now  internationally, at Zoobiquity conferences
p201
aVphysicians and veterinarians check  their attitudes and their preconceptions
p202
aVat the door and come  together as colleagues,
p203
aVas peers, as doctors.
p204
aVAfter all, we humans  are animals, too,
p205
aVand it's time for us physicians to embrace
p206
aVour patients' and our own animal natures
p207
aVand join veterinarians
p208
aVin a species-spanning approach to health.
p209
aa(lp210
VBecause it turns out,
p211
aVsome of the best and  most humanistic medicine
p212
aVis being practiced by doctors whose patients aren't human.
p213
aVAnd one of the best ways  we can take care
p214
aVof the human patient is by  paying close attention
p215
aVto how all the other  patients on the planet
p216
aVlive, grow, get sick and heal.
