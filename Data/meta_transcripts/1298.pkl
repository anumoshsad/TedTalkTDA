VOkay, I have no idea what we're going to play.
p4
aVI won't be able to tell you what it is until it happens.
p5
aVI didn't realize there was going to be a little music before.
p6
aVSo I think I'm going to start with what I just heard.

p11
aa(lp12
VOkay, so first of all,
p13
aVlet's welcome Mr. Jamire Williams on the drums,
p14
aV(Applause)
p15
aVBurniss Travis on the bass,
p16
aV(Applause)
p17
aVand Mr. Christian Sands on the piano.

aa(lp21
VSo the bandstand, as we call it,
p22
aVthis is an incredible space.
p23
aVIt is really a sacred space.
p24
aVAnd one of the things that is really sacred about it
p25
aVis that you have no opportunity to think about the future,
p26
aVor the past.
p27
aVYou really are alive right here in this moment.
p28
aVThere are so many decisions being made
p29
aVwhen you walk on the bandstand.
p30
aVWe had no idea what key we were going to play in.
p31
aVIn the middle, we sort of made our way
p32
aVinto a song called "Titi Boom."
p33
aVBut that could have happened \u2014 maybe, maybe not.
p34
aVEveryone's listening. We're responding.
p35
aVYou have no time for projected ideas.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo the idea of a mistake:
p38
aVFrom the perspective of a jazz musician,
p39
aVit's easier to talk about someone else's mistake.
p40
aVSo the way I perceive a mistake when I'm on the bandstand \u2014
p41
aVfirst of all, we don't really see it as a mistake.
p42
aVThe only mistake lies
p43
aVin that I'm not able to perceive
p44
aVwhat it is that someone else did.
p45
aVEvery "mistake" is an opportunity in jazz.
p46
aVSo it's hard to even describe
p47
aVwhat a funny note would be.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo for example, if I played a color, like we were playing on a palette,
p50
aVthat sounded like this ...
p51
aV(Music)
p52
aVSo if Christian played a note \u2014 like play an F.
p53
aV(Music)
p54
aVSee, these are all right inside of the color palette.
p55
aVIf you played an E.
p56
aVSee, these all lie right inside
p57
aVof this general emotional palette that we were painting.
p58
aVIf you played an F# though,
p59
aV(Dissonance)
p60
aVto most people's ears, they would perceive that as a mistake.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo I'm going to show you, we're going to play just for a second.
p63
aVAnd we're going to play on this palette.
p64
aVAnd at some point, Christian will introduce this note.
p65
aVAnd we won't react to it.
p66
aVHe'll introduce it for a second
p67
aVand then I'll stop, I'll talk for a second.
p68
aVWe'll see what happens when we play with this palette.
p69
aa(lp70
V(Music)
p71
aa(lp72
VSo someone could conceptually perceive that as a mistake.
p73
aVThe only way that I would say it was a mistake
p74
aVis in that we didn't react to it.
p75
aVIt was an opportunity that was missed.
p76
aVSo it's unpredictable. We'll paint this palette again.
p77
aVHe'll play it. I don't know how we'll react to it, but something will change.
p78
aVWe'll all accept his ideas,
p79
aVor not.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Music)
p82
aa(lp83
VSo you see, he played this note.
p84
aVI ended up creating a melody out of it.
p85
aVThe texture changed in the drums this time.
p86
aVIt got a little bit more rhythmic, a little bit more intense
p87
aVin response to how I responded to it.
p88
aVSo there is no mistake.
p89
aVThe only mistake is if I'm not aware,
p90
aVif each individual musician is not aware
p91
aVand accepting enough of his fellow band member
p92
aVto incorporate the idea and we don't allow for creativity.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo jazz, this bandstand is absolutely amazing.
p95
aVIt's a very purifying experience.
p96
aVAnd I know that I speak for all of us when I tell you that we don't take it for granted.
p97
aVWe know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing.
p98
aVSo how does this all relate to behavioral finance?
p99
aVWell we're jazz musicians,
p100
aVso stereotypically we don't have a great relationship to finance.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VAnyway, I just wanted to sort of point out the way that we handle it.
p105
aVAnd the other dynamic of it
p106
aVis that we don't micromanage in jazz.
p107
aVYou have some people who do.
p108
aVBut what that does
p109
aVis it actually limits the artistic possibilities.
p110
aVIf I come up and I dictate to the band
p111
aVthat I want to play like this and I want the music to go this way,
p112
aVand I just jump right in ...
p113
aVready, just play some time.
p114
aVOne, two, one, two, three, four.
p115
aV(Music)
p116
aVIt's kind of chaotic because I'm bullying my ideas.
p117
aVI'm telling them, "You come with me over this way."
p118
aa(lp119
VIf I really want the music to go there,
p120
aVthe best way for me to do it is to listen.
p121
aVThis is a science of listening.
p122
aVIt has far more to do with what I can perceive
p123
aVthan what it is that I can do.
p124
aVSo if I want the music to get to a certain level of intensity,
p125
aVthe first step for me is
p126
aVto be patient, to listen to what's going on
p127
aVand pull from something that's going on around me.
p128
aVWhen you do that, you engage and inspire the other musicians
p129
aVand they give you more, and gradually it builds.
p130
aVWatch. One, two, a one, two, three, four.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Music)
p133
aa(lp134
VTotally different experience when I'm pulling ideas.
p135
aVIt's much more organic. It's much more nuanced.
p136
aVIt's not about bullying my vision or anything like that.
p137
aVIt's about being here in the moment,
p138
aVaccepting one another
p139
aVand allowing creativity to flow.
