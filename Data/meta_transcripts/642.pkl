VThank you.
p4
aVTwo years ago, I stood on the TED stage in Arusha, Tanzania.
p5
aVI spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations.
p6
aVIt was a simple machine that changed my life.
p7
aa(lp8
VBefore that time,
p9
aVI had never been away from my home
p10
aVin Malawi.
p11
aVI had never used a computer.
p12
aVI had never seen an Internet.
p13
aVOn the stage that day, I was so nervous.
p14
aVMy English lost,
p15
aVI wanted to vomit.
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aVI had never been surrounded by so many azungu,
p18
aVwhite people.
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VThere was a story I wouldn't tell you then.
p22
aVBut well, I'm feeling good right now.
p23
aVI would like to share that story today.
p24
aVWe have seven children in my family.
p25
aVAll sisters, excepting me.
p26
aVThis is me with my dad when I was a little boy.
p27
aVBefore I discovered the wonders of science,
p28
aVI was just a simple farmer
p29
aVin a country of poor farmers.
p30
aVLike everyone else, we grew maize.
p31
aa(lp32
VOne year our fortune turned very bad.
p33
aVIn 2001 we experienced an awful famine.
p34
aVWithin five months all Malawians began to starve to death.
p35
aVMy family ate one meal per day, at night.
p36
aVOnly three swallows of nsima for each one of us.
p37
aVThe food passes through our bodies.
p38
aVWe drop down to nothing.
p39
aa(lp40
VIn Malawi, the secondary school,
p41
aVyou have to pay school fees.
p42
aVBecause of the hunger, I was forced to drop out of school.
p43
aVI looked at my father
p44
aVand looked at those dry fields.
p45
aVIt was the future I couldn't accept.
p46
aa(lp47
VI felt very happy to be at the secondary school,
p48
aVso I was determined to do anything possible
p49
aVto receive education.
p50
aVSo I went to a library.
p51
aVI read books, science books, especially physics.
p52
aVI couldn't read English that well.
p53
aVI used diagrams and pictures
p54
aVto learn the words around them.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnother book put that knowledge in my hands.
p57
aVIt said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity.
p58
aVPump water meant irrigation,
p59
aVa defense against hunger,
p60
aVwhich we were experiencing by that time.
p61
aVSo I decided I would build one windmill for myself.
p62
aVBut I didn't have materials to use,
p63
aVso I went to a scrap yard
p64
aVwhere I found my materials.
p65
aVMany people, including my mother,
p66
aVsaid I was crazy.
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VI found a tractor fan,
p70
aVshock absorber, PVC pipes.
p71
aVUsing a bicycle frame
p72
aVand an old bicycle dynamo,
p73
aVI built my machine.
p74
aVIt was one light at first.
p75
aVAnd then four lights,
p76
aVwith switches, and even a circuit breaker,
p77
aVmodeled after an electric bell.
p78
aVAnother machine pumps water
p79
aVfor irrigation.
p80
aa(lp81
VQueues of people start lining up at my house
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aVto charge their mobile phone.
p84
aV(Applause)
p85
aVI could not get rid of them.
p86
aV(Laughter)
p87
aVAnd the reporters came too,
p88
aVwhich lead to bloggers
p89
aVand which lead to a call from something called TED.
p90
aVI had never seen an airplane before.
p91
aVI had never slept in a hotel.
p92
aVSo, on stage that day in Arusha,
p93
aVmy English lost,
p94
aVI said something like,
p95
aV"I tried. And I made it."
p96
aa(lp97
VSo I would like to say something
p98
aVto all the people out there like me
p99
aVto the Africans, and the poor
p100
aVwho are struggling with your dreams.
p101
aVGod bless.
p102
aVMaybe one day you will watch this on the Internet.
p103
aVI say to you, trust yourself and believe.
p104
aVWhatever happens, don't give up.
p105
aVThank you.
