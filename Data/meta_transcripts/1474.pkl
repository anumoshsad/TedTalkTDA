VI am no designer, nope, no way.
p4
aVMy dad was,
p5
aVwhich is kind of an interesting way to grow up.
p6
aVI had to figure out what it is my dad did
p7
aVand why it was important.
p8
aa(lp9
VDad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up,
p10
aVyou know, "Bad design is just people not thinking, John," he would say
p11
aVwhenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower
p12
aVor, say, a typewriter ribbon would get tangled
p13
aVor an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen.
p14
aa(lp15
VYou know, "Design \u2014 bad design, there's just no excuse for it.
p16
aVIt's letting stuff happen without thinking about it.
p17
aVEvery object should be about something, John.
p18
aVIt should imagine a user.
p19
aVIt should cast that user in a story starring the user and the object.
p20
aa(lp21
VGood design," my dad said, "is about supplying intent."
p22
aVThat's what he said.
p23
aa(lp24
VDad helped design the control panels for the IBM 360 computer.
p25
aVThat was a big deal; that was important. He worked for Kodak for a while; that was important.
p26
aVHe designed chairs and desks and other office equipment for Steelcase; that was important.
p27
aVI knew design was important in my house because, for heaven's sake, it put food on our table, right?
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd design was in everything my dad did.
p30
aVHe had a Dixieland jazz band when we were growing up,
p31
aVand he would always cover Louis Armstrong tunes.
p32
aVAnd I would ask him every once in a while,
p33
aa(lp34
V"Dad, do you want it to sound like the record?"
p35
aVWe had lots of old jazz records lying around the house.
p36
aVAnd he said, "No, never, John, never.
p37
aVThe song is just a given, that's how you have to think about it.
p38
aVYou gotta make it your own. You gotta design it.
p39
aVShow everyone what you intend," is what he said.
p40
aV"Doing that, acting by design, is what we all should be doing.
p41
aVIt's where we all belong."
p42
aa(lp43
VAll of us? Designers?
p44
aVOh, oh, Dad. Oh, Dad.
p45
aa(lp46
VThe song is just a given.
p47
aVIt's how you cover it that matters.
p48
aVWell, let's hold on to that thought for just a minute.
p49
aVIt's kind of like this wheelchair I'm in, right?
p50
aVThe original tune? It's a little scary.
p51
aa(lp52
V"Ooh, what happened to that dude?
p53
aVHe can't walk. Anybody know the story?
p54
aVAnybody?"
p55
aa(lp56
VI don't like to talk about this very much, but I'll tell you guys the story today.
p57
aVAll right, exactly 36 years ago this week, that's right,
p58
aVI was in a poorly designed automobile
p59
aVthat hit a poorly designed guardrail
p60
aVon a poorly designed road in Pennsylvania,
p61
aVand plummeted down a 200-foot embankment
p62
aVand killed two people in the car.
p63
aVBut ever since then, the wheelchair has been a given in my life.
p64
aVMy life, at the mercy of good design and bad design.
p65
aa(lp66
VThink about it. Now, in design terms,
p67
aVa wheelchair is a very difficult object.
p68
aVIt mostly projects tragedy and fear and misfortune,
p69
aVand it projects that message, that story, so strongly
p70
aVthat it almost blots out anything else.
p71
aa(lp72
VI roll swiftly through an airport, right?
p73
aVAnd moms grab their kids out of the way and say, "Don't stare!"
p74
aVThe poor kid, you know, has this terrified look on his face, God knows what they think.
p75
aVAnd for decades, I'm going,
p76
aVwhy does this happen? What can I do about it? How can I change this? I mean there must be something.
p77
aVSo I would roll, I'd make no eye contact \u2014 just kinda frown, right?
p78
aVOr I'd dress up really, really sharply or something.
p79
aVOr I'd make eye contact with everyone \u2014
p80
aVthat was really creepy; that didn't work at all.
p81
aV(Laughter)
p82
aVYou know anything, I'd try. I wouldn't shower for a week \u2014 nothing worked.
p83
aa(lp84
VNothing whatsoever worked until a few years ago,
p85
aVmy six-year-old daughters were looking at this wheelchair catalog that I had, and they said,
p86
aa(lp87
V"Oh, Dad! Dad! Look, you gotta get these, these flashy wheels \u2014 you gotta get 'em!"
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd I said, "Oh, girls, Dad is a very important journalist,
p90
aVthat just wouldn't do at all."
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd of course, they immediately concluded,
p93
aa(lp94
V"Oh, what a bummer, Dad. Journalists aren't allowed to have flashy wheels.
p95
aVI mean, how important could you be then?" they said.
p96
aa(lp97
VI went, "Wait a minute, all right, right \u2014 I'll get the wheels." Purely out of protest,
p98
aa(lp99
VI got the flashy wheels, and I installed them and \u2014
p100
aVcheck this out. Could I have my special light cue please?
p101
aV(Laughter)
p102
aVLook at that!
p103
aVNow ... look at, look at this! Look at this!
p104
aa(lp105
VSo what you are looking at here
p106
aVhas completely changed my life,
p107
aVI mean totally changed my life.
p108
aVInstead of blank stares and awkwardness,
p109
aVnow it is pointing and smiling!
p110
aa(lp111
VPeople going, "Awesome wheels, dude! Those are awesome!
p112
aVI mean, I want some of those wheels!" Little kids say,
p113
aV"Can I have a ride?"
p114
aV(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd of course there's the occasional person \u2014
p117
aVusually a middle-aged male who will say,
p118
aV"Oh, those wheels are great!
p119
aVI guess they're for safety, right?"
p120
aV(Laughter)
p121
aVNo! They're not for safety.
p122
aVNo, no, no, no, no.
p123
aa(lp124
VWhat's the difference here,
p125
aVthe wheelchair with no lights
p126
aVand the wheelchair with lights?
p127
aVThe difference is intent.
p128
aVThat's right, that's right; I'm no longer a victim.
p129
aVI chose to change the situation \u2014 I'm the Commander of the Starship Wheelchair with the phaser wheels in the front. Right?
p130
aVIntent changes the picture completely.
p131
aVI choose to enhance
p132
aVthis rolling experience
p133
aVwith a simple design element.
p134
aVActing with intent.
p135
aVIt conveys authorship.
p136
aVIt suggests that someone is driving.
p137
aVIt's reassuring; people are drawn to it.
p138
aVSomeone making the experience their own.
p139
aVCovering the tragic tune
p140
aVwith something different,
p141
aVsomething radically different.
p142
aVPeople respond to that.
p143
aa(lp144
VNow it seems simple, but actually I think
p145
aVin our society and culture in general,
p146
aVwe have a huge problem with intent.
p147
aVNow go with me here. Look at this guy. You know who this is?
p148
aVIt's Anders Breivik. Now, if he intended to kill
p149
aVin Olso, Norway last year,
p150
aVdozens and dozens of young people \u2014
p151
aVif he intended to do that,
p152
aVhe's a vicious criminal. We punish him.
p153
aVLife in prison. Death penalty in the United States, not so much in Norway.
p154
aVBut, if he instead acted out of a delusional fantasy,
p155
aVif he was motivated by some random mental illness,
p156
aVhe's in a completely different category.
p157
aVWe may put him away for life, but
p158
aVwe watch him clinically.
p159
aVIt's a completely different domain.
p160
aVAs an intentional murderer,
p161
aVAnders Breivik is merely evil.
p162
aVBut as a dysfunctional,
p163
aVas a dysfunctional murderer/psychotic,
p164
aVhe's something much more complicated.
p165
aVHe's the breath of some
p166
aVprimitive, ancient chaos.
p167
aVHe's the random state of nature
p168
aVwe emerged from.
p169
aVHe's something very, very different.
p170
aa(lp171
VIt's as though intent is an essential component for humanity.
p172
aVIt's what we're supposed to do somehow.
p173
aVWe're supposed to act with intent.
p174
aVWe're supposed to do things by design.
p175
aVIntent is a marker for civilization.
p176
aa(lp177
VNow here's an example a little closer to home:
p178
aVMy family is all about intent.
p179
aVYou can probably tell there are two sets of twins,
p180
aVthe result of IVF technology, in vitro fertilization technology,
p181
aVdue to some physical limitations I won't go into.
p182
aVAnyway, in vitro technology, IVF,
p183
aVis about as intentional as agriculture.
p184
aVLet me tell you, some of you may have the experience.
p185
aVIn fact, the whole technology of sperm extraction
p186
aVfor spinal cord-injured males was invented by a veterinarian.
p187
aVI met the dude. He's a great guy.
p188
aVHe carried this big leather bag full of sperm probes for
p189
aVall of the animals that he'd worked with,
p190
aVall the different animals.
p191
aVProbes he designed,
p192
aVand in fact, he was really, really proud of these probes.
p193
aa(lp194
VHe would say, "You're right between horse and squirrel, John."
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aVBut anyway, so when my wife and I decided
p197
aVto upgrade our early middle age \u2014 we had four kids, after all \u2014
p198
aVwith a little different technology
p199
aVthat I won't explain in too much detail here \u2014
p200
aVmy urologist assured me I had nothing whatsoever to worry about.
p201
aa(lp202
V"No need for birth control, Doc, are you sure about that?"
p203
aa(lp204
V"John, John, I looked at your chart.
p205
aVFrom your sperm tests we can
p206
aVconfidently say that
p207
aVyou're basically a form of birth control."
p208
aa(lp209
VWell!
p210
aV(Laughter)
p211
aVWhat a liberating thought! Yes!
p212
aVAnd after a couple very liberating weekends,
p213
aVmy wife and I,
p214
aVutilizing some cutting-edge erectile technology
p215
aVthat is certainly worthy of a TEDTalk someday
p216
aVbut I won't get into it now,
p217
aVwe noticed some familiar, if unexpected, symptoms.
p218
aVI wasn't exactly a form of birth control.
p219
aVLook at that font there. My wife was so pissed.
p220
aa(lp221
VI mean, did a designer come up with that?
p222
aVNo, I don't think a designer did come up with that.
p223
aVIn fact, maybe that's the problem.
p224
aVAnd so, little Ajax was born.
p225
aVHe's like our other children,
p226
aVbut the experience is completely different.
p227
aVIt's something like my accident, right?
p228
aVHe came out of nowhere.
p229
aVBut we all had to change,
p230
aVbut not just react to the given;
p231
aVwe bend to this new experience with intent.
p232
aVWe're five now. Five.
p233
aVFacing the given with intent. Doing things by design.
p234
aVHey, the name Ajax \u2014 you can't get much more intentional than that, right?
p235
aVWe're really hoping he thanks us for that later on.
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VBut I never became a designer. No, no, no, no. Never attempted. Never even close.
p239
aVI did love some great designs as I was growing up:
p240
aVThe HP 35S calculator \u2014 God, I loved that thing. Oh God, I wish I had one.
p241
aVMan, I love that thing.
p242
aVI could afford that.
p243
aVOther designs I really couldn't afford, like the 1974 911 Targa.
p244
aVIn school, I studied nothing close to design or engineering;
p245
aVI studied useless things like the Classics,
p246
aVbut there were some lessons even there \u2014
p247
aVthis guy, Plato, it turns out he's a designer.
p248
aVHe designed a state in "The Republic,"
p249
aVa design never implemented.
p250
aVListen to one of the design features
p251
aVof Plato's Government 4.0:
p252
aa(lp253
V"The State in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern
p254
aVis always the best and most quietly governed,
p255
aVand the State in which they are most eager, the worst."
p256
aa(lp257
VWell, got that wrong, didn't we?
p258
aVBut look at that statement; it's all about intent. That's what I love about it.
p259
aVBut consider what Plato is doing here. What is he doing?
p260
aVIt's a grand idea of design \u2014 a huge idea of design,
p261
aVcommon to all of the voices of religion and philosophy
p262
aVthat emerged in the Classical period.
p263
aVWhat was going on then?
p264
aVThey were trying to answer the question of
p265
aVwhat would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive?
p266
aVAs the human race emerged from a prehistoric chaos,
p267
aVa confrontation with random, brutal nature,
p268
aVthey suddenly had a moment to think \u2014 and there was a lot to think about.
p269
aVAll of a sudden, human existence needed an intent.
p270
aVHuman life needed a reason.
p271
aVReality itself needed a designer.
p272
aVThe given was replaced
p273
aVby various aspects of intent,
p274
aVby various designs,
p275
aVby various gods.
p276
aVGods we're still fighting about. Oh yeah.
p277
aa(lp278
VToday we don't confront the chaos of nature.
p279
aVToday it is the chaos of humanity's impact on the Earth itself that we confront.
p280
aVThis young discipline called design, I think,
p281
aVis in fact the emerging ethos
p282
aVformulating and then answering a very new question:
p283
aVWhat shall we do now
p284
aVin the face of the chaos that we have created?
p285
aVWhat shall we do?
p286
aVHow shall we inscribe intent
p287
aVon all the objects we create,
p288
aVon all the circumstances we create,
p289
aVon all the places we change?
p290
aVThe consequences of a planet with 7 billion people and counting.
p291
aVThat's the tune we're all covering today, all of us.
p292
aVAnd we can't just imitate the past. No.
p293
aVThat won't do.
p294
aVThat won't do at all.
p295
aa(lp296
VHere's my favorite design moment:
p297
aVIn the city of Kinshasa in Zaire in the 1990s,
p298
aVI was working for ABC News, and I was reporting on
p299
aVthe fall of Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator, the brutal dictator in Zaire,
p300
aVwho raped and pillaged that country.
p301
aVThere was rioting in the middle of Kinshasa.
p302
aVThe place was falling apart; it was a horrible, horrible place,
p303
aVand I needed to go and explore the center of Kinshasa
p304
aVto report on the rioting and the looting.
p305
aVPeople were carrying off vehicles, carrying off pieces of buildings.
p306
aVSoldiers were in the streets shooting at looters and herding some in mass arrests.
p307
aVIn the middle of this chaos, I'm rolling around in a wheelchair,
p308
aVand I was completely invisible. Completely.
p309
aVI was in a wheelchair; I didn't look like a looter.
p310
aVI was in a wheelchair; I didn't look like a journalist, particularly, at least from their perspective.
p311
aVAnd I didn't look like a soldier, that's for sure.
p312
aVI was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of Zaire, completely invisible.
p313
aVAnd all of a sudden, from around a corner, comes this young man, paralyzed, just like me,
p314
aVin this metal and wood and leather
p315
aVpedal, three-wheel tricycle-wheelchair device,
p316
aVand he pedals up to me as fast as he can.
p317
aa(lp318
VHe goes, "Hey, mister! Mister!"
p319
aa(lp320
VAnd I looked at him \u2014
p321
aVhe didn't know any other English than that, but we didn't need English, no, no, no, no, no.
p322
aVWe sat there and compared wheels and tires and spokes and tubes.
p323
aVAnd I looked at his whacky pedal mechanism;
p324
aVhe was full of pride over his design.
p325
aVI wish I could show you that contraption.
p326
aVHis smile, our glow
p327
aVas we talked a universal language
p328
aVof design,
p329
aVinvisible to the chaos around us.
p330
aVHis machine: homemade, bolted, rusty, comical.
p331
aVMy machine: American-made, confident, sleek.
p332
aVHe was particularly proud of the comfortable seat, really comfortable seat
p333
aVhe had made in his chariot
p334
aVand its beautiful fabric fringe around the edge.
p335
aVOh, I wish I'd had those sparkly wheels back then to have shown him, man!
p336
aVHe would have loved those! Oh yeah.
p337
aVHe would have understood those;
p338
aVa chariot of pure intent \u2014 think about it \u2014
p339
aVin a city out of control.
p340
aVDesign blew it all away for a moment.
p341
aVWe spoke for a few minutes and then each of us vanished back into the chaos.
p342
aVHe went back to the streets of Kinshasa;
p343
aVI went to my hotel. And I think of him now, now ...
p344
aa(lp345
VAnd I pose this question.
p346
aVAn object imbued with intent \u2014
p347
aVit has power,
p348
aVit's treasure, we're drawn to it.
p349
aVAn object devoid of intent \u2014
p350
aVit's random, it's imitative,
p351
aVit repels us. It's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away.
p352
aVThis is what we must demand of our lives,
p353
aVof our objects, of our things, of our circumstances:
p354
aVliving with intent.
p355
aVAnd I have to say
p356
aVthat on that score, I have a very unfair advantage over all of you.
p357
aa(lp358
VAnd I want to explain it to you now because this is a very special day.
p359
aVThirty-six years ago at nearly this moment,
p360
aVa 19-year-old boy awoke from a coma
p361
aVto ask a nurse a question,
p362
aVbut the nurse was already there with an answer.
p363
aa(lp364
V"You've had a terrible accident, young man. You've broken your back.
p365
aVYou'll never walk again."
p366
aa(lp367
VI said, "I know all that \u2014 what day is it?"
p368
aVYou see, I knew that the car had gone over the guardrail on the 28th of February,
p369
aVand I knew that 1976 was a leap year.
p370
aa(lp371
V"Nurse! Is this the 28th or the 29th?"
p372
aa(lp373
VAnd she looked at me and said,
p374
aV"It's March 1st."
p375
aa(lp376
VAnd I went, "Oh my God.
p377
aVI've got some catching up to do!"
p378
aVAnd from that moment, I knew
p379
aVthe given was that accident;
p380
aVI had no option but to make up
p381
aVthis new life without walking.
p382
aVIntent \u2014 a life with intent \u2014
p383
aVlived by design,
p384
aVcovering the original
p385
aVwith something better.
p386
aVIt's something for all of us to do or find a way to do in these times.
p387
aa(lp388
VTo get back to this,
p389
aVto get back to design,
p390
aVand as my daddy suggested a long time ago,
p391
aa(lp392
V"Make the song your own, John.
p393
aVShow everybody what you intend."
p394
aa(lp395
VDaddy,
p396
aVthis one's for you.
