VWe're going to go on a dive to the deep sea,
p4
aVand anyone that's had that lovely opportunity
p5
aVknows that for about two and half hours on the way down,
p6
aVit's a perfectly positively pitch-black world.
p7
aVAnd we used to see the most mysterious animals out the window
p8
aVthat you couldn't describe:
p9
aVthese blinking lights \u2014 a world of bioluminescence, like fireflies.
p10
aVDr. Edith Widder \u2014 she's now at the Ocean Research and Conservation Association \u2014
p11
aVwas able to come up with a camera
p12
aVthat could capture some of these incredible animals,
p13
aVand that's what you're seeing here on the screen.
p14
aa(lp15
VThat's all bioluminescence. Like I said: just like fireflies.
p16
aVThere's a flying turkey under a tree.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VI'm a geologist by training.
p21
aVBut I love that.
p22
aVAnd you see, some of the bioluminescence they use to avoid being eaten,
p23
aVsome they use to attract prey,
p24
aVbut all of it, from an artistic point of view,
p25
aVis just positively amazing.
p26
aVAnd a lot of what goes on inside \u2014
p27
aVThere's a fish with glowing eyes, pulsating eyes.
p28
aVSome of the colors are designed to hypnotize,
p29
aVthese lovely patterns.
p30
aVAnd then this last one,
p31
aVone of my favorites, this pinwheel design.
p32
aVJust absolutely amazing, every single dive.
p33
aa(lp34
VThat's the unknown world, and today we've only explored
p35
aVabout 3 percent of what's out there in the ocean.
p36
aVAlready we've found the world's highest mountains,
p37
aVthe world's deepest valleys,
p38
aVunderwater lakes, underwater waterfalls \u2014
p39
aVa lot of that we shared with you from the stage.
p40
aVAnd in a place where we thought no life at all,
p41
aVwe find more life, we think, and diversity and density
p42
aVthan the tropical rainforest,
p43
aVwhich tells us that we don't know much about this planet at all.
p44
aVThere's still 97 percent,
p45
aVand either that 97 percent is empty or just full of surprises.
p46
aa(lp47
VBut I want to jump up to shallow water now
p48
aVand look at some creatures that are positively amazing.
p49
aVCephalopods \u2014 head-foots.
p50
aVAs a kid I knew them as calamari, mostly.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VThis is an octopus.
p55
aVThis is the work of Dr. Roger Hanlon at the Marine Biological Lab,
p56
aVand it's just fascinating how cephalopods can,
p57
aVwith their incredible eyes, sense their surroundings,
p58
aVlook at light, look at patterns.
p59
aVHere's an octopus moving across the reef,
p60
aVfinds a spot to settle down, curls up and then disappears into the background.
p61
aVTough thing to do.
p62
aa(lp63
VIn the next bit, we're going to see a couple squid.
p64
aVNow males, when they fight,
p65
aVif they're really aggressive, they turn white.
p66
aVAnd these two males are fighting.
p67
aVThey do it by bouncing their butts together,
p68
aVwhich is an interesting concept.
p69
aVNow, here's a male on the left and a female on the right,
p70
aVand the male has managed to split his coloration
p71
aVso the female only always sees the kinder, gentler squid in him.
p72
aa(lp73
V(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VLet's take a look at it again. Watch the coloration:
p76
aVwhite on the right, brown on the left.
p77
aVHe takes a step back,
p78
aVhe's keeping off the other males by splitting his body,
p79
aVand comes up on the other side \u2014
p80
aVBingo!
p81
aVNow, I'm told that's not not just a squid phenomenon with males,
p82
aVbut I don't know.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VCuttlefish. I love cuttlefish.
p87
aVThis is a Giant Australian Cuttlefish.
p88
aVAnd there he is, his droopy little eyes up here.
p89
aVBut they can do pretty amazing things, too.
p90
aVHere we're going to see one backing into a crevice,
p91
aVand watch his tentacles \u2014
p92
aVhe just pulls them in, makes them look just like algae.
p93
aVDisappears right into the background.
p94
aVPositively amazing.
p95
aVHere's two males fighting.
p96
aVOnce again, they're smart enough, these cephalopods;
p97
aVthey know not to hurt each other.
p98
aVBut look at the patterns that they can do with their skin.
p99
aVThat's an amazing thing.
p100
aa(lp101
VHere's an octopus.
p102
aVSometimes they don't want to be seen when they move,
p103
aVbecause predators can see them.
p104
aVThis guy can make himself look like a rock,
p105
aVand, looking at his environment,
p106
aVcan actually slide across the bottom,
p107
aVusing the waves and the shadows so he can't be seen.
p108
aVHis motion blends right into the background \u2014
p109
aVthe moving rock trick.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo, we're learning lots new from the shallow water.
p112
aVStill exploring the deep, but learning lots from the shallow water.
p113
aVThere's a good reason why:
p114
aVthe shallow water's full of predators \u2014 here's a barracuda \u2014
p115
aVand if you're an octopus or a cephalopod,
p116
aVyou need to really understand how to use your surroundings to hide.
p117
aa(lp118
VIn the next scene, you're going to see a nice coral bottom.
p119
aVAnd you see that an octopus would stand out
p120
aVvery easily there if you couldn't use your camouflage,
p121
aVuse your skin to change color and texture.
p122
aVHere's some algae in the foreground \u2014
p123
aVand an octopus.
p124
aVAin't that amazing?
p125
aa(lp126
VNow, Roger spooked him, so he took off in a cloud of ink,
p127
aVand when he lands, the octopus says, "Oh, I've been seen.
p128
aVThe best thing to do is to get as big as I can get."
p129
aVThat big brown makes his eyespot very big.
p130
aVSo, he's bluffing. Let's do it backwards.
p131
aVI thought he was joking when he first showed it to me.
p132
aVI thought it was all graphics. So here it is in reverse.
p133
aVWatch the skin color; watch the skin texture.
p134
aVJust an amazing animal, it can change color and texture
p135
aVto match the surroundings.
p136
aVWatch him blend right into this algae.
p137
aVOne, two, three.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Applause)
p140
aa(lp141
VAnd now he's gone, and so am I. Thank you very much.
