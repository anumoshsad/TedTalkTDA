VI bring to you
p4
aVa message from
p5
aVtens of thousands of people \u2014
p6
aVin the villages, in the slums,
p7
aVin the hinterland of the country \u2014
p8
aVwho have solved problems
p9
aVthrough their own genius,
p10
aVwithout any
p11
aVoutside help.
p12
aVWhen our home minister announces
p13
aVa few weeks ago
p14
aVa war on
p15
aVone third of India,
p16
aVabout 200 districts that he mentioned
p17
aVwere ungovernable,
p18
aVhe missed the point.
p19
aVThe point that we have been stressing
p20
aVfor the last 21 years,
p21
aVthe point that
p22
aVpeople may be economically poor,
p23
aVbut they're not poor in the mind.
p24
aVIn other words,
p25
aVthe minds on the margin
p26
aVare not the marginal minds.
p27
aVThat is the message,
p28
aVwhich we started 31 years ago.
p29
aVAnd what did it start?
p30
aa(lp31
VLet me just tell you, briefly, my personal journey,
p32
aVwhich led me to come to this point.
p33
aVIn '85, '86, I was in Bangladesh
p34
aVadvising the government and the research council there
p35
aVhow to help scientists work on the lands,
p36
aVon the fields of the poor people,
p37
aVand how to develop research technologies,
p38
aVwhich are based on the knowledge of the people.
p39
aVI came back in '86.
p40
aVI had been tremendously invigorated
p41
aVby the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country,
p42
aVwhich had 60 percent landlessness
p43
aVbut amazing creativity.
p44
aVI started looking at my own work:
p45
aVThe work that I had done
p46
aVfor the previous 10 years,
p47
aValmost every time,
p48
aVhad instances of knowledge
p49
aVthat people had shared.
p50
aa(lp51
VNow, I was paid in dollars as a consultant,
p52
aVand I looked at my income tax return
p53
aVand tried to ask myself: "Is there a line in my return,
p54
aVwhich shows how much of this income has gone
p55
aVto the people whose knowledge
p56
aVhas made it possible?
p57
aVWas it because I'm brilliant
p58
aVthat I'm getting this reward, or because of the revolution?
p59
aVIs it that I write very well?
p60
aVIs it that I articulate very well?
p61
aVIs it that I analyze the data very well?
p62
aVIs it because I'm a professor, and, therefore,
p63
aVI must be entitled to this reward from society?"
p64
aVI tried to convince myself that, "No, no,
p65
aVI have worked for the policy changes.
p66
aVYou know, the public policy will become
p67
aVmore responsive to the needs of the poor,
p68
aVand, therefore I think it's okay."
p69
aVBut it appeared to me
p70
aVthat all these years that I'd been working on exploitation \u2014
p71
aVexploitation by landlords,
p72
aVby moneylenders, by traders \u2014
p73
aVgave me an insight that
p74
aVprobably I was also an exploiter,
p75
aVbecause there was no line in my income tax return
p76
aVwhich showed this income accrued
p77
aVbecause of the brilliance of the people \u2014
p78
aVthose people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me \u2014
p79
aVand nothing ever went back to them.
p80
aVSo much so, that much of my work till that time
p81
aVwas in the English language.
p82
aa(lp83
VThe majority of the people from whom I learned didn't know English.
p84
aVSo what kind of a contributor was I?
p85
aVI was talking about social justice,
p86
aVand here I was, a professional
p87
aVwho was pursuing the most unjust act \u2014
p88
aVof taking knowledge from the people, making them anonymous,
p89
aVgetting rent from that knowledge
p90
aVby sharing it and doing consultancy, writing papers and
p91
aVpublishing them in the papers,
p92
aVgetting invited to the conferences,
p93
aVgetting consultancies and whatever have you.
p94
aVSo then, a dilemma rose in the mind that,
p95
aVif I'm also an exploiter, then this is not right;
p96
aVlife cannot go on like that.
p97
aVAnd this was a moment of great pain and trauma
p98
aVbecause I couldn't live with it any longer.
p99
aVSo I did a review of
p100
aVethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research,
p101
aVwrote, read about 100 papers.
p102
aVAnd I came to the conclusion that
p103
aVwhile dilemma is unique,
p104
aVdilemma is not unique; the solution had to be unique.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd one day \u2014 I don't know what happened \u2014
p107
aVwhile coming back from the office towards home,
p108
aVmaybe I saw a honey bee
p109
aVor it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee,
p110
aVlife would be wonderful.
p111
aVWhat the honey bee does: it pollinates,
p112
aVtakes nectar from the flower,
p113
aVpollinates another flower, cross-pollinates.
p114
aVAnd when it takes the nectar,
p115
aVthe flowers don't feel shortchanged.
p116
aVIn fact, they invite the honey bees
p117
aVthrough their colors,
p118
aVand the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves.
p119
aVThese are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network:
p120
aVthat whenever we learn something from people
p121
aVit must be shared with them in their language.
p122
aVThey must not remain anonymous.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd I must tell you that after 20 years,
p125
aVI have not made one percent of change
p126
aVin the professional practice of this art.
p127
aVThat is a great tragedy \u2014 which I'm carrying still with me
p128
aVand I hope that all of you will carry this with you \u2014
p129
aVthat the profession still legitimizes publication
p130
aVof knowledge of people without attributing them
p131
aVby making them anonymous.
p132
aVThe research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences
p133
aVor Research Councils of the U.K.
p134
aVor of Indian Councils of Science Research
p135
aVdo not require
p136
aVthat whatever you learn from people, you must share back with them.
p137
aVWe are talking about an accountable society,
p138
aVa society that is fair and just,
p139
aVand we don't even do justice in the knowledge market.
p140
aVAnd India wants to be a knowledge society.
p141
aVHow will it be a knowledge society?
p142
aVSo, obviously, you cannot have two principles of justice,
p143
aVone for yourself and one for others.
p144
aVIt must be the same.
p145
aVYou cannot discriminate.
p146
aVYou cannot be in favor of your own values,
p147
aVwhich are at a distance from
p148
aVthe values that you espouse.
p149
aVSo, fairness to one and to the other
p150
aVis not divisible.
p151
aa(lp152
VLook at this picture.
p153
aVCan you tell me where has it been taken from,
p154
aVand what is it meant for? Anybody?
p155
aVI'm a professor; I must quiz you. (Laughter)
p156
aVAnybody? Any guess at all?
p157
aVPardon? (Audience Member: Rajasthan.)
p158
aVAnil Gupta: But what has it been used for? What has it been used for?
p159
aV(Murmuring)
p160
aVPardon?
p161
aVYou know, you're so right. We must give him a hand,
p162
aVbecause this man knows how insensitive our government is.
p163
aVLook at this. This is the site of the government of India.
p164
aVIt invites tourists
p165
aVto see the shame of our country.
p166
aVI'm so sorry to say that.
p167
aVIs this a beautiful picture
p168
aVor is it a terrible picture?
p169
aVIt depends upon how you look at the life of the people.
p170
aVIf this woman has to carry water on her head
p171
aVfor miles and miles and miles,
p172
aVyou cannot be celebrating that.
p173
aVWe should be doing something about it.
p174
aVAnd let me tell you, with all the science and technology at our command,
p175
aVmillions of women still carry water on their heads.
p176
aVAnd we do not ask this question.
p177
aa(lp178
VYou must have taken tea in the morning.
p179
aVThink for a minute.
p180
aVThe leaves of the tea, plucked from the bushes;
p181
aVyou know what the action is? The action is:
p182
aVThe lady picks up a few leaves, puts them in the basket on the backside.
p183
aVJust do it 10 times;
p184
aVyou will realize the pain in this shoulder.
p185
aVAnd she does it a few thousand times
p186
aVevery day.
p187
aVThe rice that you ate in the lunch, and you will eat today,
p188
aVis transplanted by women
p189
aVbending in a very awkward posture,
p190
aVmillions of them,
p191
aVevery season, in the paddy season,
p192
aVwhen they transplant paddy
p193
aVwith their feet in the water.
p194
aVAnd feet in the water will develop fungus,
p195
aVinfections,
p196
aVand that infection pains
p197
aVbecause then other insects bite that point.
p198
aVAnd every year,
p199
aV99.9 percent of the paddy is transplanted manually.
p200
aVNo machines have been developed.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo the silence of scientists,
p203
aVof technologists, of public policy makers,
p204
aVof the change agent, drew our attention that this is not on, this is not on;
p205
aVthis is not the way society will work.
p206
aVThis is not what our parliament would do. You know,
p207
aVwe have a program for employment:
p208
aVOne hundred, 250 million people
p209
aVhave to be given jobs for 100 days by this great country.
p210
aVDoing what? Breaking stones, digging earth.
p211
aVSo we asked a question to the parliament:
p212
aVDo poor have heads?
p213
aVDo poor have legs, mouth and hands, but no head?
p214
aa(lp215
VSo Honey Bee Network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich.
p216
aVAnd what has happened?
p217
aVAn anonymous, faceless, nameless person
p218
aVgets in contact with the network,
p219
aVand then gets an identity.
p220
aVThis is what Honey Bee Network is about.
p221
aVAnd this network grew voluntarily,
p222
aVcontinues to be voluntary,
p223
aVand has tried to map the minds
p224
aVof millions of people
p225
aVof our country and other parts of the world who are creative.
p226
aVThey could be creative in terms of education,
p227
aVthey may be creative in terms of culture,
p228
aVthey may be creative in terms of institutions;
p229
aVbut a lot of our work is in the field of technological creativity,
p230
aVthe innovations,
p231
aVeither in terms of contemporary innovations,
p232
aVor in terms of traditional knowledge.
p233
aVAnd it all begins with curiosity.
p234
aVIt all begins with curiosity.
p235
aa(lp236
VThis person, whom we met \u2014 and you will see it on the website,
p237
aVwww.sristi.org \u2014 this tribal person,
p238
aVhe had a wish.
p239
aVAnd he said, "If my wish gets fulfilled" \u2014
p240
aVsomebody was sick and he had to monitor \u2014
p241
aV"God, please cure him.
p242
aVAnd if you cure him, I will get my wall painted."
p243
aVAnd this is what he got painted.
p244
aVSomebody was talking yesterday about Maslowian hierarchy.
p245
aVThere could be nothing more wrong than
p246
aVthe Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs
p247
aVbecause the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment.
p248
aVKabir, Rahim, all the great Sufi saints,
p249
aVthey were all poor people,
p250
aVand they had a great reason. (Applause)
p251
aVPlease do not ever think that
p252
aVonly after meeting your physiological needs and other needs
p253
aVcan you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment.
p254
aVAny person anywhere is capable
p255
aVof rising to that highest point of attainment,
p256
aVonly by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something.
p257
aa(lp258
VLook at this.
p259
aVWe saw it in Shodh Yatra. Every six months we walk
p260
aVin different parts of the country.
p261
aVI've walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years.
p262
aVSo on the wayside
p263
aVwe found these dung cakes,
p264
aVwhich are used as a fuel.
p265
aVNow, this lady, on the wall of the dung cake heap,
p266
aVhas made a painting.
p267
aVThat's the only space she could express her creativity.
p268
aVAnd she's so marvelous.
p269
aVLook at this lady, Ram Timari Devi,
p270
aVon a grain bin. In Champaran, we had a Shodh Yatra
p271
aVand we were walking
p272
aVin the land where Gandhiji went
p273
aVto hear about the tragedy, pain
p274
aVof indigo growers.
p275
aVBhabi Mahato in Purulia and Bankura.
p276
aVLook at what she has done.
p277
aVThe whole wall is her canvas. She's sitting there with a broom.
p278
aVIs she an artisan or an artist?
p279
aVObviously she's an artist; she's a creative person.
p280
aVIf we can create markets for these artists,
p281
aVwe will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones.
p282
aVThey will be paid for what they are good at, not what they're bad at.
p283
aV(Applause)
p284
aa(lp285
VLook at what Rojadeen has done.
p286
aVIn Motihari in Champaran,
p287
aVthere are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack
p288
aVand, obviously, there's a limited market for tea.
p289
aVEvery morning you have tea, as well as coffee.
p290
aVSo he thought, why don't I convert
p291
aVa pressure cooker into a coffee machine?
p292
aVSo this is a coffee machine. Just takes a few hundred rupees.
p293
aVPeople bring their own cooker,
p294
aVhe attaches a valve and a steam pipe,
p295
aVand now he gives you espresso coffee. (Laughter)
p296
aVNow, this is a real, affordable
p297
aVcoffee percolator that works on gas.
p298
aV(Applause)
p299
aVLook at what Sheikh Jahangir has done.
p300
aVA lot of poor people do not have
p301
aVenough grains to get ground.
p302
aVSo this fellow is bringing
p303
aVa flour-grinding machine on a two-wheeler.
p304
aVIf you have 500 grams, 1000, one kilogram,
p305
aVhe will grind it for it for you; the flourmill will not grind such a small quantity.
p306
aa(lp307
VPlease understand the problem of poor people.
p308
aVThey have needs which
p309
aVhave to be met efficiently
p310
aVin terms of energy, in terms of cost, in terms of quality.
p311
aVThey don't want second-standard, second-quality outputs.
p312
aVBut to be able to give them high-quality output
p313
aVyou need to adapt technology to their needs.
p314
aVAnd that is what Sheikh Jahangir did.
p315
aVBut that's not enough, what he did. Look at what he did here.
p316
aVIf you have clothes, and you don't have enough time to wash them,
p317
aVhe brought a washing machine
p318
aVto your doorstep, mounted on a two-wheeler.
p319
aVSo here's a model where
p320
aVa two-wheeler washing machine ...
p321
aVHe is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep.
p322
aV(Applause)
p323
aVYou bring your water, you bring your soap,
p324
aVI wash the clothes for you. Charge 50 paisa, one rupee
p325
aVfor you per lot,
p326
aVand a new business model can emerge.
p327
aVNow, what we need is, we need
p328
aVpeople who will be able to scale them up.
p329
aa(lp330
VLook at this.
p331
aVIt looks like a beautiful photograph.
p332
aVBut you know what it is? Can anybody guess what it is?
p333
aVSomebody from India would know, of course.
p334
aVIt's a tawa.
p335
aVIt's a hot plate made of clay.
p336
aVNow, what is the beauty in it?
p337
aVWhen you have a non-stick pan,
p338
aVit costs about,
p339
aVmaybe, 250 rupees,
p340
aVfive dollars, six dollars.
p341
aVThis is less than a dollar
p342
aVand this is non-stick;
p343
aVit is coated with one of these
p344
aVfood-grade materials.
p345
aVAnd the best part is that,
p346
aVwhile you use a costly non-stick pan,
p347
aVyou eat the so-called Teflon
p348
aVor Teflon-like material
p349
aVbecause after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone?
p350
aVIt has gone in your stomach. It was not meant for that. (Laughter)
p351
aVYou know? But here
p352
aVin this clay hot plate,
p353
aVit will never go into your stomach.
p354
aVSo it is better, it is safer;
p355
aVit is affordable, it is energy-efficient.
p356
aVIn other words, solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper,
p357
aVneed not be, so-called, jugaad, need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement.
p358
aa(lp359
VThey have to be better, they have to be more efficient,
p360
aVthey have to be affordable.
p361
aVAnd that is what Mansukh Bhai Prajapati has done.
p362
aVHe has designed this plate with a handle.
p363
aVAnd now with one dollar,
p364
aVyou can afford a better alternative
p365
aVthan the people market is offering you.
p366
aVThis lady, she developed
p367
aVa herbal pesticide formulation.
p368
aVWe filed the patent for her,
p369
aVthe National Innovation Foundation.
p370
aVAnd who knows? Somebody will license this technology
p371
aVand develop marketable products,
p372
aVand she would get revenue.
p373
aVNow, let me mention one thing:
p374
aVI think we need a polycentric model of development,
p375
aVwhere a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country,
p376
aVin different parts of the world,
p377
aVwould solve the needs of locality
p378
aVin a very efficient and adaptive manner.
p379
aVHigher the local fit,
p380
aVgreater is the chance of scaling up.
p381
aa(lp382
VIn the scaling up,
p383
aVthere's an inherent inadequacy
p384
aVto match the needs of the local people,
p385
aVpoint by point, with the supply that you're making.
p386
aVSo why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch?
p387
aVThings can scale up, and they have scaled up.
p388
aVFor example, cell phones: We have 400 million cellphones in this country.
p389
aVNow, it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone,
p390
aVonly three options on the cellphone.
p391
aVIt has 300 options, I'm paying for 300; I'm using only three
p392
aVbut I'm willing to live with it, therefore it is scaling up.
p393
aVBut if I had to get a match to match,
p394
aVobviously, I would need a different design of a cellphone.
p395
aVSo what we're saying is that scalability
p396
aVshould not become an enemy of sustainability.
p397
aVThere must be a place in the world
p398
aVfor solutions that are only relevant for a locality,
p399
aVand yet, one can be able to fund them.
p400
aa(lp401
VOne of the greatest studies that we've been finding is
p402
aVthat many times investors would ask this question \u2014
p403
aV"What is a scalable model?" \u2014
p404
aVas if the need of a community, which is only
p405
aVlocated in a space and time
p406
aVand has those needs only located in those places,
p407
aVhas no legitimate right to get them for free
p408
aVbecause it's not part of a larger scale.
p409
aVSo either you sub-optimize your needs to a larger scale
p410
aVor else you remain out.
p411
aVNow, the eminent model, the long-tail model
p412
aVtells you that small sales
p413
aVof a large number of books, for example,
p414
aVhaving only a few copies sold
p415
aVcan still be a viable model.
p416
aVAnd we must find a mechanism where
p417
aVpeople will pool in the portfolio, will invest in the portfolio,
p418
aVwhere different innovations will go to
p419
aVa small number of people in their localities,
p420
aVand yet, the overall platform of the model will become viable.
p421
aa(lp422
VLook at what he is doing.
p423
aVSaidullah Sahib is an amazing man.
p424
aVAt the age of 70,
p425
aVhe is linking up something very creative.
p426
aa(lp427
V(Music)
p428
aa(lp429
VSaidullah Sahib: I couldn't wait for the boat.
p430
aVI had to meet my love.
p431
aVMy desperation made me an innovator.
p432
aVEven love needs help from technology.
p433
aVInnovation is the light of my wife, Noor.
p434
aVNew inventions are the passion of my life.
p435
aVMy technology.
p436
aa(lp437
V(Applause)
p438
aa(lp439
VAG: Saidulluh Sahib is
p440
aVin Motihari, again in Champaran.
p441
aVWonderful human being,
p442
aVbut he stills sells, at this age,
p443
aVhoney on a cycle to earn his livelihood,
p444
aVbecause we haven't been able to convince the water park people,
p445
aVthe lake people, in [unclear] operations.
p446
aVAnd we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people
p447
aVin Mumbai \u2014 where there was a flood a few years ago
p448
aVand people had to walk 20 kilometers, wading in the water \u2014
p449
aVthat, look, you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office
p450
aVbecause you can then go to those lanes
p451
aVwhere your buses will not go, where your transport will not go.
p452
aVSo we have not yet cracked the problem
p453
aVof making it available as a rescue device,
p454
aVas a vending device during the floods in eastern India,
p455
aVwhen you have to deliver things to people

VWhat has Appachan done? Appachan, unfortunately, is no more,
p461
aVbut he has left behind a message.
p462
aVA very powerful message
p463
aa(lp464
VAppachan: I watch the world wake up every day.
p465

p467
aa(lp468
VIt's not that a coconut fell on my head,
p469
aVand I came upon this idea.
p470
aVWith no money to fund my studies,
p471
aVI scaled new heights.
p472
aVNow, they call me the local Spiderman.
p473
aVMy technology.

VAG: Many of you
p478
aVmight not realize and believe
p479
aVthat we have sold this product internationally \u2014
p480
aVwhat I call a G2G model,
p481
aVgrassroots to global.
p482
aVAnd a professor in the University of Massachusetts,
p483
aVin the zoology department,
p484
aVbought this climber because she wanted
p485
aVto study the insect diversity
p486
aVof the top of the tree canopy.
p487
aVAnd this device makes it possible
p488
aVfor her to take samples from a larger number of palms,
p489
aVrather than only a few,
p490
aVbecause otherwise she had to make a big platform
p491
aVand then climb her [unclear] would climb on that.
p492
aVSo, you know, we are advancing the frontiers of science.
p493
aa(lp494
VRemya Jose has developed ...
p495
aVyou can go to the YouTube and find India Innovates
p496
aVand then you will find these videos.
p497
aVInnovation by her when she was in class 10th:
p498
aVa washing machine-cum-exercising machine.
p499
aVMr. Kharai who is a physically challenged person,
p500
aVone and a half foot height, only.
p501
aVBut he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy
p502
aVand freedom and flexibility.
p503
aVThis innovation is from the slums of Rio.
p504
aVAnd this person, Mr. Ubirajara.
p505
aVWe were talking about, my friends in Brazil,
p506
aVhow we scale up this model in China and Brazil.
p507
aVAnd we have a very vibrant network in China, particularly,
p508
aVbut also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world.
p509
aVThis stand on the front wheel, you will not find on any cycle.
p510
aVIndia and China have the largest number of cycles.
p511
aVBut this innovation emerged in Brazil.
p512
aa(lp513
VThe point is, none of us should be parochial,
p514
aVnone of us should be so nationalistic to believe
p515
aVthat all good ideas will come only from our country.
p516
aVNo, we have to have the humility to learn
p517
aVfrom knowledge of economically poor people, wherever they are.
p518
aVAnd look at this whole range of cycle-based innovations:
p519
aVcycle that's a sprayer, cycle that
p520
aVgenerates energy from the shocks on the road.
p521
aVI can't change the condition of the road,
p522
aVbut I can make the cycle run faster.
p523
aVThat is what Kanak Das has done.
p524
aVAnd in South Africa,
p525
aVwe had taken our innovators,
p526
aVand many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa
p527
aVas to how innovation can become
p528
aVa means of liberation
p529
aVfrom the drudgery that people have.
p530
aVAnd this is a donkey cart which they modified.
p531
aVThere's an axle here, of 30, 40 kg,
p532
aVserving no purpose.
p533
aVRemove it, the cart needs one donkey less.
p534
aa(lp535
VThis is in China. This girl needed a breathing apparatus.
p536
aVThese three people in the village
p537
aVsat down and decided to think,
p538
aV"How do we elongate the life of this girl of our village?"
p539
aVThey were not related to her, but they tried to find out,
p540
aV"How can we use ... "
p541
aVThey used a cycle, they put together a breathing apparatus.
p542
aVAnd this breathing apparatus now saved the life,
p543
aVand she's very welcome.
p544
aa(lp545
VThere's a whole range of innovations that we have.
p546
aVA car, which runs on compressed air
p547
aVwith six paisa per kilometer.
p548
aVAssam, Kanak Gogoi.
p549
aVAnd you would not find this car in U.S. or Europe,
p550
aVbut this is available in India.
p551
aVNow, this lady, she used to do the winding of the yarn
p552
aVfor Pochampally Saree.
p553
aVIn one day, 18,000 times,
p554
aVshe had to do this winding
p555
aVto generate two sarees.
p556
aVThis is what her son has done after seven years of struggle.
p557
aVShe said, "Change your profession."
p558
aVHe said, "I can't. This is the only thing I know, but I'll invent a machine,
p559
aVwhich will solve your problem."
p560
aVAnd this is what he did, a sewing machine in Uttar Pradesh.
p561
aVSo, this is what SRISTI is saying:
p562
aV"Give me a place to stand, and I will move the world."
p563
aa(lp564
VI will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children
p565
aVfor creativity, a whole range of things.
p566
aVWe have sold things all over the world,
p567
aVfrom Ethiopia to Turkey to U.S. to wherever.
p568
aVProducts have gone to the market, a few.
p569
aVThese are the people whose knowledge made
p570
aVthis Herbavate cream for eczema possible.
p571
aVAnd here, a company which licensed this herbal pesticide
p572
aVput a photograph of the innovator on the packing
p573
aVso that every time a user uses it,
p574
aVit asks the user, "You can also be an innovator.
p575
aVIf you have an idea, send it back to us."
p576
aVSo, creativity counts, knowledge matters,
p577
aVinnovations transform, incentives inspire.
p578
aVAnd incentives: not just material, but also non-material incentives.
p579
