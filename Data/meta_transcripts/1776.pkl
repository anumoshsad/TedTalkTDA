VI'm going to be talking about designing humor,
p4
aVwhich is sort of an interesting thing, but it goes
p5
aVto some of the discussions about constraints,
p6
aVand how in certain contexts, humor is right,
p7
aVand in other contexts it's wrong.
p8
aa(lp9
VNow, I'm from New York,
p10
aVso it's 100 percent satisfaction here.
p11
aVActually, that's ridiculous, because when it comes to humor,
p12
aV75 percent is really absolutely the best you can hope for.
p13
aVNobody is ever satisfied 100 percent with humor
p14
aVexcept this woman.
p15
aa(lp16
V(Video) Woman: (Laughs)
p17
aa(lp18
VBob Mankoff: That's my first wife.
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aVThat part of the relationship went fine.
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aa(lp23
VNow let's look at this cartoon.
p24
aVOne of the things I'm pointing out is that
p25
aVcartoons appear within the context
p26
aVof The New Yorker magazine,
p27
aVthat lovely Caslon type, and it seems
p28
aVlike a fairly benign cartoon within this context.
p29
aVIt's making a little bit fun of getting older,
p30
aVand, you know, people might like it.
p31
aa(lp32
VBut like I said, you cannot satisfy everyone.
p33
aVYou couldn't satisfy this guy.
p34
aa(lp35
V"Another joke on old white males. Ha ha. The wit.
p36
aVIt's nice, I'm sure to be young and rude,
p37
aVbut some day you'll be old, unless you drop dead as I wish."
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VThe New Yorker is rather a sensitive environment,
p42
aVvery easy for people to get their nose out of joint.
p43
aVAnd one of the things that you realize
p44
aVis it's an unusual environment.
p45
aVHere I'm one person talking to you.
p46
aVYou're all collective. You all hear each other laugh and know each other laugh.
p47
aVIn The New Yorker, it goes out to a wide audience,
p48
aVand when you actually look at that,
p49
aVand nobody knows what anybody else is laughing at,
p50
aVand when you look at that the subjectivity involved in humor
p51
aVis really interesting.
p52
aa(lp53
VLet's look at this cartoon.
p54
aa(lp55
V"Discouraging data on the antidepressant."
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VIndeed, it is discouraging.
p60
aVNow, you would think, well, look,
p61
aVmost of you laughed at that.
p62
aVRight? You thought it was funny.
p63
aVIn general, that seems like a funny cartoon,
p64
aVbut let's look what online survey I did.
p65
aVGenerally, about 85 percent of the people liked it.
p66
aVA hundred and nine voted it a 10, the highest. Ten voted it one.
p67
aVBut look at the individual responses.
p68
aa(lp69
V"I like animals!!!!!" Look how much they like them.
p70
aV(Laughter)
p71
aV"I don't want to hurt them. That doesn't seem very funny to me."
p72
aa(lp73
VThis person rated it a two.
p74
aV"I don't like to see animals suffer \u2014 even in cartoons."
p75
aa(lp76
VTo people like this, I point out we use anesthetic ink.
p77
aVOther people thought it was funny.
p78
aVThat actually is the true nature of the distribution of humor
p79
aVwhen you don't have the contagion of humor.
p80
aa(lp81
VHumor is a type of entertainment.
p82
aVAll entertainment contains a little frisson of danger,
p83
aVsomething that might happen wrong,
p84
aVand yet we like it when there's protection.
p85
aVThat's what a zoo is. It's danger. The tiger is there.
p86
aVThe bars protect us. That's sort of fun, right?
p87
aVThat's a bad zoo.
p88
aV(Laughter)
p89
aVIt's a very politically correct zoo, but it's a bad zoo.
p90
aVBut this is a worse one.
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aVSo in dealing with humor in the context of The New Yorker,
p93
aVyou have to see, where is that tiger going to be?
p94
aVWhere is the danger going to exist?
p95
aVHow are you going to manage it?
p96
aVMy job is to look at 1,000 cartoons a week.
p97
aVBut The New Yorker only can take 16 or 17 cartoons,
p98
aVand we have 1,000 cartoons.
p99
aVOf course, many, many cartoons must be rejected.
p100
aVNow, we could fit more cartoons in the magazine
p101
aVif we removed the articles.
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aVBut I feel that would be a huge loss,
p104
aVone I could live with, but still huge.
p105
aa(lp106
VCartoonists come in through the magazine every week.
p107
aVThe average cartoonist who stays with the magazine
p108
aVdoes 10 or 15 ideas every week.
p109
aVBut they mostly are going to be rejected.
p110
aVThat's the nature of any creative activity.
p111
aVMany of them fade away. Some of them stay.
p112
aa(lp113
VMatt Diffee is one of them.
p114
aVHere's one of his cartoons.
p115
aV(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VDrew Dernavich. "Accounting night at the improv."
p118
aV"Now is the part of the show when we ask the audience
p119
aVto shout out some random numbers."
p120
aa(lp121
VPaul Noth. "He's all right. I just wish he were a little more pro-Israel."
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VNow I know all about rejection,
p125
aVbecause when I quit \u2014 actually, I was booted out of \u2014 psychology school
p126
aVand decided to become a cartoonist, a natural segue,
p127
aVfrom 1974 to 1977 I submitted 2,000 cartoons to The New Yorker,
p128
aVand got 2,000 cartoons rejected by The New Yorker.
p129
aVAt a certain point, this rejection slip, in 1977 \u2014
p130
aV[We regret that we are unable to use the enclosed material. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider it.] \u2014
p131
aVmagically changed to this.
p132
aV[Hey! You sold one. No shit! You really sold a cartoon to the fucking New Yorker magazine.]
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVNow of course that's not what happened,
p135
aVbut that's the emotional truth.
p136
aVAnd of course, that is not New Yorker humor.
p137
aa(lp138
VWhat is New Yorker humor?
p139
aVWell, after 1977, I broke into The New Yorker and started selling cartoons.
p140
aVFinally, in 1980, I received the revered
p141
aVNew Yorker contract,
p142
aVwhich I blurred out parts because it's none of your business.
p143
aa(lp144
VFrom 1980. "Dear Mr. Mankoff, confirming the agreement
p145
aVthere of \u2014 " blah blah blah blah \u2014 blur \u2014
p146
aV"for any idea drawings."
p147
aa(lp148
VWith respect to idea drawings, nowhere in the contract
p149
aVis the word "cartoon" mentioned.
p150
aVThe word "idea drawings," and that's the sine qua non of New Yorker cartoons.
p151
aVSo what is an idea drawing? An idea drawing is something
p152
aVthat requires you to think.
p153
aVNow that's not a cartoon. It requires thinking
p154
aVon the part of the cartoonist and thinking on your part
p155
aVto make it into a cartoon.
p156
aV(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VHere are some, generally you get my cast of cartoon mind.
p159
aa(lp160
V"There is no justice in the world. There is some justice in the world. The world is just."
p161
aa(lp162
VThis is What Lemmings Believe.
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VThe New Yorker and I, when we made comments,
p167
aVthe cartoon carries a certain ambiguity about what it actually is.
p168
aVWhat is it, the cartoon? Is it really about lemmings?
p169
aVNo. It's about us.
p170
aVYou know, it's my view basically about religion,
p171
aVthat the real conflict and all the fights between religion
p172
aVis who has the best imaginary friend.
p173
aV(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd this is my most well-known cartoon.
p176
aV"No, Thursday's out. How about never \u2014 is never good for you?"
p177
aVIt's been reprinted thousands of times, totally ripped off.
p178
aVIt's even on thongs,
p179
aVbut compressed to "How about never \u2014 is never good for you?"
p180
aa(lp181
VNow these look like very different forms of humor
p182
aVbut actually they bear a great similarity.
p183
aVIn each instance, our expectations are defied.
p184
aVIn each instance, the narrative gets switched.
p185
aVThere's an incongruity and a contrast.
p186
aVIn "No, Thursday's out. How about never \u2014 is never good for you?"
p187
aVwhat you have is the syntax of politeness
p188
aVand the message of being rude.
p189
aVThat really is how humor works. It's a cognitive synergy
p190
aVwhere we mash up these two things which don't go together
p191
aVand temporarily in our minds exist.
p192
aVHe is both being polite and rude.
p193
aVIn here, you have the propriety of The New Yorker
p194
aVand the vulgarity of the language.
p195
aVBasically, that's the way humor works.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo I'm a humor analyst, you would say.
p198
aVNow E.B. White said, analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog.
p199
aVNobody is much interested, and the frog dies.
p200
aVWell, I'm going to kill a few, but there won't be any genocide.
p201
aVBut really, it makes me \u2014
p202
aVLet's look at this picture. This is an interesting picture,
p203
aVThe Laughing Audience.
p204
aVThere are the people, fops up there,
p205
aVbut everybody is laughing, everybody is laughing
p206
aVexcept one guy.
p207
aVThis guy. Who is he? He's the critic.
p208
aVHe's the critic of humor,
p209
aVand really I'm forced to be in that position,
p210
aVwhen I'm at The New Yorker, and that's the danger
p211
aVthat I will become this guy.
p212
aa(lp213
VNow here's a little video made by Matt Diffee, sort of
p214
aVhow they imagine if we really exaggerated that.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Video) Bob Mankoff: "Oooh, no.
p217
aVEhhh.
p218
aVOooh. Hmm. Too funny.
p219
aVNormally I would but I'm in a pissy mood.
p220
aVI'll enjoy it on my own. Perhaps.
p221
aVNo. Nah. No.
p222
aVOverdrawn. Underdrawn.
p223
aVDrawn just right, still not funny enough.
p224
aVNo. No.
p225
aVFor God's sake no, a thousand times no.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Music)
p228
aa(lp229
VNo. No. No. No. No. [Four hours later]
p230
aVHey, that's good, yeah, whatcha got there?
p231
aa(lp232
VOffice worker: Got a ham and swiss on rye?BM: No.
p233
aa(lp234
VOffice worker: Okay. Pastrami on sourdough?BM: No.
p235
aa(lp236
VOffice worker: Smoked turkey with bacon?BM: No.
p237
aa(lp238
VOffice worker: Falafel?BM: Let me look at it.
p239
aVEh, no.
p240
aVOffice worker: Grilled cheese?BM: No.
p241
aVOffice worker: BLT?BM: No.
p242
aa(lp243
VOffice worker: Black forest ham and mozzarella with apple mustard?BM: No.
p244
aa(lp245
VOffice worker: Green bean salad?BM: No.
p246
aa(lp247
V(Music)
p248
aa(lp249
VNo. No.
p250
aVDefinitely no. [Several hours after lunch]
p251
aa(lp252
V(Siren)
p253
aa(lp254
VNo. Get out of here.
p255
aa(lp256
V(Laughter)
p257
aa(lp258
VThat's sort of an exaggeration of what I do.
p259
aa(lp260
VNow, we do reject, many, many, many cartoons,
p261
aVso many that there are many books called "The Rejection Collection."
p262
aV"The Rejection Collection" is not quite New Yorker kind of humor.
p263
aVAnd you might notice the bum on the sidewalk here
p264
aVwho is boozing and his ventriloquist dummy is puking.
p265
aVSee, that's probably not going to be New Yorker humor.
p266
aVIt's actually put together by Matt Diffee, one of our cartoonists.
p267
aa(lp268
VSo I'll give you some examples of rejection collection humor.
p269
aa(lp270
V"I'm thinking about having a child."
p271
aa(lp272
V(Laughter)
p273
aa(lp274
VThere you have an interesting \u2014 the guilty laugh,
p275
aVthe laugh against your better judgment.
p276
aa(lp277
V(Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
V"Ass-head. Please help."
p280
aa(lp281
V(Laughter)
p282
aa(lp283
VNow, in fact, within a context of this book,
p284
aVwhich says, "Cartoons you never saw and never will see
p285
aVin The New Yorker," this humor is perfect.
p286
aVI'm going to explain why.
p287
aVThere's a concept about humor about it being
p288
aVa benign violation.
p289
aVIn other words, for something to be funny, we've got to think
p290
aVit's both wrong and also okay at the same time.
p291
aVIf we think it's completely wrong, we say, "That's not funny."
p292
aVAnd if it's completely okay, what's the joke? Okay?
p293
aVAnd so, this benign, that's true of "No, Thursday's out. How about never \u2014 is never good for you?"
p294
aVIt's rude. The world really shouldn't be that way.
p295
aVWithin that context, we feel it's okay.
p296
aVSo within this context, "Asshead. Please help"
p297
aVis a benign violation.
p298
aa(lp299
VWithin the context of The New Yorker magazine ...
p300
aV"T-Cell Army: Can the body's immune response
p301
aVhelp treat cancer?" Oh, goodness.
p302
aVYou're reading about this smart stuff,
p303
aVthis intelligent dissection of the immune system.
p304
aVYou glance over at this, and it says,
p305
aV"Asshead. Please help"? God.
p306
aVSo there the violation is malign. It doesn't work.
p307
aVThere is no such thing as funny in and of itself.
p308
aVEverything will be within the context and our expectations.
p309
aa(lp310
VOne way to look at it is this.
p311
aVIt's sort of called a meta-motivational theory about how we look,
p312
aVa theory about motivation and the mood we're in
p313
aVand how the mood we're in determines the things we like
p314
aVor dislike.
p315
aVWhen we're in a playful mood, we want excitement.
p316
aVWe want high arousal. We feel excited then.
p317
aVIf we're in a purposeful mood, that makes us anxious.
p318
aV"The Rejection Collection" is absolutely in this field.
p319
aVYou want to be stimulated. You want to be aroused.
p320
aVYou want to be transgressed.
p321
aVIt's like this, like an amusement park.
p322
aa(lp323
VVoice: Here we go. (Screams)
p324
aa(lp325
VHe laughs. He is both in danger and safe,
p326
aVincredibly aroused. There's no joke. No joke needed.
p327
aVIf you arouse people enough and get them stimulated enough,
p328
aVthey will laugh at very, very little.
p329
aa(lp330
VThis is another cartoon from "The Rejection Collection."
p331
aV"Too snug?"
p332
aVThat's a cartoon about terrorism.
p333
aVThe New Yorker occupies a very different space.
p334
aVIt's a space that is playful in its own way, and also purposeful,
p335
aVand in that space, the cartoons are different.
p336
aa(lp337
VNow I'm going to show you cartoons The New Yorker did
p338
aVright after 9/11, a very, very sensitive area when humor could be used.
p339
aVHow would The New Yorker attack it?
p340
aVIt would not be with a guy with a bomb saying, "Too snug?"
p341
aVOr there was another cartoon I didn't show because
p342
aVactually I thought maybe people would be offended.
p343
aVThe great Sam Gross cartoon, this happened
p344
aVafter the Muhammad controversy where it's Muhammad in heaven,
p345
aVthe suicide bomber is all in little pieces,
p346
aVand he's saying to the suicide bomber,
p347
aV"You'll get the virgins when we find your penis."
p348
aa(lp349
V(Laughter)
p350
aa(lp351
VBetter left undrawn.
p352
aa(lp353
VThe first week we did no cartoons.
p354
aVThat was a black hole for humor, and correctly so.
p355
aVIt's not always appropriate every time.
p356
aVBut the next week, this was the first cartoon.
p357
aa(lp358
V"I thought I'd never laugh again. Then I saw your jacket."
p359
aa(lp360
VIt basically was about, if we were alive,
p361
aVwe were going to laugh. We were going to breathe.
p362
aVWe were going to exist. Here's another one.
p363
aa(lp364
V"I figure if I don't have that third martini, then the terrorists win."
p365
aa(lp366
VThese cartoons are not about them. They're about us.
p367
aVThe humor reflects back on us.
p368
aVThe easiest thing to do with humor, and it's perfectly legitimate,
p369
aVis a friend makes fun of an enemy.
p370
aVIt's called dispositional humor.
p371
aVIt's 95 percent of the humor. It's not our humor.
p372
aa(lp373
VHere's another cartoon.
p374
aa(lp375
V"I wouldn't mind living in a fundamentalist Islamic state."
p376
aa(lp377
V(Laughter)
p378
aa(lp379
VHumor does need a target.
p380
aVBut interestingly, in The New Yorker, the target is us.
p381
aVThe target is the readership and the people who do it.
p382
aVThe humor is self-reflective
p383
aVand makes us think about our assumptions.
p384
aVLook at this cartoon by Roz Chast, the guy reading the obituary.
p385
aa(lp386
V"Two years younger than you, 12 years older than you,
p387
aVthree years your junior, your age on the dot,
p388
aVexactly your age."
p389
aa(lp390
VThat is a deeply profound cartoon.
p391
aVAnd so The New Yorker is also trying to, in some way,
p392
aVmake cartoons say something besides funny
p393
aVand something about us. Here's another one.
p394
aa(lp395
V"I started my vegetarianism for health reasons,
p396
aVThen it became a moral choice, and now it's just to annoy people."
p397
aa(lp398
V(Laughter)
p399
aa(lp400
V"Excuse me \u2014 I think there's something wrong with this
p401
aVin a tiny way that no one other than me would ever be able to pinpoint."
p402
aa(lp403
VSo it focuses on our obsessions, our narcissism,
p404
aVour foils and our foibles, really not someone else's.
p405
aa(lp406
VThe New Yorker demands
p407
aVsome cognitive work on your part,
p408
aVand what it demands is what Arthur Koestler,
p409
aVwho wrote "The Act of Creation" about the relationship
p410
aVbetween humor, art and science,
p411
aVis what's called bisociation.
p412
aVYou have to bring together ideas from different frames of reference,
p413
aVand you have to do it quickly to understand the cartoon.
p414
aVIf the different frames of reference don't come together
p415
aVin about .5 seconds, it's not funny,
p416
aVbut I think they will for you here.
p417
aVDifferent frames of reference.
p418
aa(lp419
V"You slept with her, didn't you?"
p420
aa(lp421
V(Laughter)
p422
aa(lp423
V"Lassie! Get help!!"
p424
aa(lp425
V(Laughter)
p426
aa(lp427
VIt's called French Army Knife.
p428
aa(lp429
V(Laughter)
p430
aa(lp431
VAnd this is Einstein in bed. "To you it was fast."
p432
aa(lp433
V(Laughter)
p434
aa(lp435
VNow there are some cartoons that are puzzling.
p436
aVLike, this cartoon would puzzle many people.
p437
aVHow many people know what this cartoon means?
p438
aVThe dog is signaling he wants to go for a walk.
p439
aVThis is the signal for a catcher to walk the dog.
p440
aVThat's why we run a feature in the cartoon issue every year
p441
aVcalled "I Don't Get It: The New Yorker Cartoon I.Q. Test."
p442
aV(Laughter)
p443
aa(lp444
VThe other thing The New Yorker plays around with
p445
aVis incongruity, and incongruity, I've shown you,
p446
aVis sort of the basis of humor.
p447
aVSomething that's completely normal or logical isn't going to be funny.
p448
aVBut the way incongruity works is, observational humor
p449
aVis humor within the realm of reality.
p450
aa(lp451
V"My boss is always telling me what to do." Okay?
p452
aVThat could happen. It's humor within the realm of reality.
p453
aa(lp454
VHere, cowboy to a cow:
p455
aV"Very impressive. I'd like to find 5,000 more like you."
p456
aa(lp457
VWe understand that. It's absurd. But we're putting the two together.
p458
aa(lp459
VHere, in the nonsense range:
p460
aa(lp461
V"Damn it, Hopkins, didn't you get yesterday's memo?"
p462
aa(lp463
VNow that's a little puzzling, right? It doesn't quite come together.
p464
aVIn general, people who enjoy more nonsense,
p465
aVenjoy more abstract art,
p466
aVthey tend to be liberal, less conservative, that type of stuff.
p467
aVBut for us, and for me, helping design the humor,
p468
aVit doesn't make any sense to compare one to the other.
