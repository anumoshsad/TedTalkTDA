VI think it was in my second grade that I was caught
p4
aVdrawing the bust of a nude by Michelangelo.
p5
aVI was sent straight away to my school principal,
p6
aVand my school principal, a sweet nun,
p7
aVlooked at my book with disgust,
p8
aVflipped through the pages, saw all the nudes \u2014
p9
aVyou know, I'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and I'd copy her \u2014
p10
aVand the nun slapped me on my face and said,
p11
aV"Sweet Jesus, this kid has already begun."
p12
aa(lp13
VI had no clue what she was talking about,
p14
aVbut it was convincing enough for me never to draw again
p15
aVuntil the ninth grade.
p16
aVThanks to a really boring lecture,
p17
aVI started caricaturing my teachers in school.
p18
aVAnd, you know, I got a lot of popularity.
p19
aVI don't play sports. I'm really bad at sports.
p20
aVI don't have the fanciest gadgets at home.
p21
aVI'm not on top of the class.
p22
aVSo for me, cartooning gave me a sense of identity.
p23
aVI got popular, but I was scared I'd get caught again.
p24
aVSo what I did was I quickly put together
p25
aVa collage of all the teachers I had drawn,
p26
aVglorified my school principal, put him right on top,
p27
aVand gifted it to him.
p28
aVHe had a good laugh at the other teachers
p29
aVand put it up on the notice board.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVThis is a part of that.
p32
aVAnd I became a school hero.
p33
aVAll my seniors knew me. I felt really special.
p34
aa(lp35
VI have to tell you a little bit about my family.
p36
aVThat's my mother. I love her to bits.
p37
aVShe's the one who taught me how to draw and, more importantly, how to love.
p38
aVShe's a bit of a hippie.
p39
aVShe said, "Don't say that," but I'm saying it anyway.
p40
aVThe rest of my family are boring academics,
p41
aVbusy collecting Ivy League decals for our classic Ambassador car.
p42
aVMy father's a little different.
p43
aVMy father believed in a holistic approach to living,
p44
aVand, you know, every time he taught us,
p45
aVhe'd say, "I hate these books,
p46
aVbecause these books are hijacked by Industrial Revolution."
p47
aa(lp48
VWhile he still held that worldview, I was 16,
p49
aVI got the best lawyer in town,
p50
aVmy older brother Karthik,
p51
aVand I sat him down, and I said, "Pa,
p52
aVfrom today onwards I've decided
p53
aVI'm going to be disciplined,
p54
aVI'm going to be curious,
p55
aVI'm going to learn something new every day,
p56
aVI'm going to be very hard working,
p57
aVand I'm not going to depend on you
p58
aVemotionally or financially."
p59
aVAnd he was very impressed. He was all tearing up. Ready to hug me.
p60
aVAnd I said, "Hold that thought."
p61
aVI said, "Can I quit school then?"
p62
aa(lp63
VBut, to cut a long story short,
p64
aVI quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist.
p65
aVI must have done about 30,000 caricatures.
p66
aVI would do birthday parties, weddings, divorces,
p67
aVanything for anyone who wanted to use my services.
p68
aVBut, most importantly, while I was traveling,
p69
aVI taught children cartooning,
p70
aVand in exchange, I learned how to be spontaneous.
p71
aVAnd mad and crazy and fun.
p72
aVWhen I started teaching them, I said let me start doing this professionally.
p73
aVWhen I was 18 I started my own school.
p74
aVHowever, an 18 year-old trying to start a school
p75
aVis not easy unless you have a big patron
p76
aVor a big supporter.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo I was flipping through the pages of the Times of India
p79
aVwhen I saw that the Prime Minister of India
p80
aVwas visiting my home town, Bangalore.
p81
aVAnd, you know, just like how
p82
aVevery cartoonist knows Bush here,
p83
aVand if you had to meet Bush,
p84
aVit would be the funnest thing because
p85
aVhis face was a cartoonist's delight.
p86
aVI had to meet my Prime Minister.
p87
aVI went to the place where
p88
aVhis helicopter was about to land.
p89
aVI saw layers of security.
p90
aVI caricatured my way through three layers
p91
aVby just impressing the guards,
p92
aVbut I got stuck. I got stuck at the third.
p93
aVAnd what happened was, to my luck,
p94
aVI saw a nuclear scientist
p95
aVat whose party I had done cartoons.
p96
aVI ran up to him, and said, "Hello, sir. How do you do?"
p97
aVHe said, "What are you doing here, Raghava?"
p98
aVI said, "I'm here to meet the Prime Minister."
p99
aVHe said, "Oh, so am I."
p100
aVI hopped into his car, and off we went
p101
aVthrough the remaining layers of security.
p102
aV(Applause)
p103
aVThank you.
p104
aVI sat him down, I caricatured him,
p105
aVand since then I've caricatured hundreds of celebrities.
p106
aa(lp107
VThis is one I remember fondly.
p108
aVSalman Rushdie was pissed-off I think
p109
aVbecause I altered the map of New York, if you notice.
p110
aV(Laughter)
p111
aVAnyway, the next slide I'm about to show you \u2014
p112
aV(Laughter)
p113
aVShould I just turn that off?
p114
aVThe next slide I'm about to show you,
p115
aVis a little more serious.
p116
aVI was hesitant to include this in my presentation
p117
aVbecause this cartoon was published
p118
aVsoon after 9/11.
p119
aVWhat was, for me, a very naive observation,
p120
aVturned out to be a disaster.
p121
aVThat evening, I came home to hundreds of hate mails,
p122
aVhundreds of people telling me how they
p123
aVcould have lived another day without seeing this.
p124
aVI was also asked to leave the organization,
p125
aVa cartoonists' organization in America,
p126
aVthat for me was my lifeline.
p127
aVThat's when I realized, you know, cartoons are really powerful,
p128
aVart comes with responsibility.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnyway, what I did was I decided
p131
aVthat I need to take a break.
p132
aVI quit my job at the papers, I closed my school,
p133
aVand I wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks,
p134
aVand I decided to go traveling.
p135
aVWhen I went traveling, I remember,
p136
aVI met this fabulous old man,
p137
aVwho I met when I was caricaturing,
p138
aVwho turned out to be an artist, in Italy.
p139
aVHe invited me to his studio. He said, "Come and visit."
p140
aVWhen I went, I saw the ghastliest thing ever.
p141
aVI saw this dead, naked effigy of himself
p142
aVhanging from the ceiling.
p143
aVI said, "Oh, my God. What is that?"
p144
aVAnd I asked him, and he said,
p145
aV"Oh, that thing? In the night, I die.
p146
aVIn the morning, I am born again."
p147
aVI thought he was koo koo,
p148
aVbut something about that really stuck.
p149
aVI loved it. I thought there was something really beautiful about that.
p150
aVSo I said, "I am dead, so I need to be born again."
p151
aa(lp152
VSo, I wanted to be a painter like him,
p153
aVexcept, I don't know how to paint.
p154
aVSo, I tried going to the art store.
p155
aVYou know, there are a hundred types of brushes.
p156
aVForget it, they will confuse you
p157
aVeven if you know how to draw.
p158
aVSo I decided, I'm going to learn to paint by myself.
p159
aVI'm going to show you a very quick clip
p160
aVto show you how I painted and a little bit
p161
aVabout my city, Bangalore.
p162
aV(Music)
p163
aVThey had to be larger than life.
p164
aVEverything had to be larger. The next painting was even bigger.
p165
aVAnd even bigger.
p166
aVAnd for me it was, I had to dance while I painted.
p167
aVIt was so exciting.
p168
aVExcept, I even started painting dancers.
p169
aVHere for example is a Flamenco dancer,
p170
aVexcept there was one problem.
p171
aVI didn't know the dance form, so I started following them,
p172
aVand I made some money,
p173
aVsold my paintings and would rush off
p174
aVto France or Spain and work with them.
p175
aVThat's Pepe Linares, the renowned Flamenco singer.
p176
aa(lp177
VBut I had one problem, my paintings never danced.
p178
aVAs much energy as I put into them
p179
aVwhile making them, they never danced.
p180
aVSo I decided \u2014 I had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning.
p181
aVI called my friends, painted on their bodies,
p182
aVand had them dance in front of a painting.
p183
aVAnd, all of a sudden, my paintings came alive.
p184
aVAnd then I was fortunate enough
p185
aVto actually perform this in California with Velocity Circus.
p186
aVAnd I sat like you guys there in the audience.
p187
aVAnd I saw my work come alive.
p188
aVYou know, normally you work in isolation,
p189
aVand you show at a gallery,
p190
aVbut here, the work was coming alive,
p191
aVand it had some other artists working with me.
p192
aa(lp193
VThe collaborative effort was fabulous.
p194
aVI said, I'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody I meet.
p195
aVI started doing fashion.
p196
aVThis is a fashion show we held in London.
p197
aVThe best collaboration, of course, is with children.
p198
aVThey are ruthless, they are honest,
p199
aVbut they're full of energy and fun.
p200
aVThis is a work, a library I designed for the Robin Hood Foundation.
p201
aVAnd I must say, I spent time in the Bronx
p202
aVworking with these kids.
p203
aVAnd, in exchange for me working with them,
p204
aVthey taught me how to be cool.
p205
aVI don't think I've succeeded, but they've taught me.
p206
aVThey said, "Stop saying sorry. Say, my bad."
p207
aV(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VThen I said, all this is good,
p210
aVbut I want to paint like a real painter.
p211
aVAmerican education is so expensive.
p212
aVI was in India, and I was walking down the streets,
p213
aVand I saw a billboard painter.
p214
aVAnd these guys paint humongous paintings,
p215
aVand they look really good.
p216
aVAnd I wondered how they did it from so close.
p217
aVSo, one day I had the opportunity to meet one of these guys,
p218
aVand I said, "How do you paint like that? Who taught you?"
p219
aVAnd he said, "Oh, it's very easy. I can teach you,
p220
aVbut we're leaving the city,
p221
aVbecause billboard painters are a dying,
p222
aVextinct bunch of artists,
p223
aVbecause digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them."
p224
aVI said, in exchange for education in how to paint,
p225
aVI will support them, and I started a company.
p226
aVAnd since then, I've been painting all over the place.
p227
aVThis is a painting I did of my wife in my apartment.
p228
aVThis is another painting.
p229
aVAnd, in fact, I started painting on anything,
p230
aVand started sending them around town.
p231
aa(lp232
VSince I mentioned my wife, the most important collaboration
p233
aVhas been with her, Netra.
p234
aVNetra and I met when she was 18.
p235
aVI must have been 19 and a half then,
p236
aVand it was love at first sight.
p237
aVI lived in India. She lived in America.
p238
aVShe'd come every two months to visit me,
p239
aVand then I said I'm the man,
p240
aVI'm the man, and I have to reciprocate.
p241
aVI have to travel seven oceans, and I have to come and see you.
p242
aVI did that twice, and I went broke.
p243
aVSo then I said, "Nets, what do I do?"
p244
aVShe said, "Why don't you send me your paintings?
p245
aVMy dad knows a bunch of rich guys.
p246
aVWe'll try and con them into buying it,
p247
aVand then..."
p248
aVBut it turned out, after I sent the works to her,
p249
aVthat her dad's friends,
p250
aVlike most of you, are geeks.
p251
aVI'm joking.
p252
aV(Laughter)
p253
aVNo, they were really big geeks,
p254
aVand they didn't know much about art.
p255
aVSo Netra was stuck with 30 paintings of mine.
p256
aa(lp257
VSo what we did was we rented a little van
p258
aVand we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it.
p259
aVShe contacted anyone and everyone
p260
aVwho was willing to buy my work.
p261
aVShe made enough money, she sold off the whole collection
p262
aVand made enough money to move me for four years
p263
aVwith lawyers, a company, everything,
p264
aVand she became my manager.
p265
aVThat's us in New York.
p266
aVNotice one thing,
p267
aVwe're equal here.
p268
aVSomething happened along the line.
p269
aV(Laughter)
p270
aa(lp271
VBut this brought me \u2014 with Netra managing my career \u2014
p272
aVit brought me a lot of success.
p273
aVI was really happy. I thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar.
p274
aVI loved the attention.
p275
aVThis is all the press we got, and we said,
p276
aVit's time to celebrate.
p277
aVAnd I said that the best way to celebrate is to marry Netra.
p278
aVI said, "Let's get married."
p279
aVAnd I said, "Not just married. Let's invite everyone who's helped us,
p280
aVall the people who bought our work."
p281
aVAnd you won't believe it, we put together a list of 7,000 people,
p282
aVwho had made a difference \u2014 a ridiculous list,
p283
aVbut I was determined to bring them to India, so \u2014
p284
aVa lot of them were in India.
p285
aV150 artists volunteered to help me with my wedding.
p286
aVWe had fashion designers, installation artists,
p287
aVmodels, we had makeup artists, jewelry designers,
p288
aVall kinds of people working with me
p289
aVto make my wedding an art installation.
p290
aVAnd I had a special installation in tribute to my in-laws.
p291
aVI had the vegetable carvers work on that for me.
p292
aa(lp293
VBut all this excitement led
p294
aVto the press writing about us.
p295
aVWe were in the papers, we're still in the news three years later,
p296
aVbut, unfortunately, something tragic happened right after.
p297
aVMy mother fell very ill.
p298
aVI love my mother
p299
aVand I was told all of a sudden that she was going to die.
p300
aVAnd they said you have to say bye to her,
p301
aVyou have to do what you have to do.
p302
aVAnd I was devastated.
p303
aVI had shows booked up for another year.
p304
aVI was on a high.
p305
aVAnd I couldn't. I could not.
p306
aa(lp307
VMy life was not exuberant.
p308
aVI could not live this larger than life person.
p309
aVI started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind.
p310
aVOf course, my work turned ugly,
p311
aVbut another thing happened.
p312
aVI lost all my audiences.
p313
aVThe Bollywood stars who I would party with
p314
aVand buy my work disappeared.
p315
aVThe collectors, the friends, the press,
p316
aVeveryone said, "Nice, but thank you."
p317
aV"No thank you," was more like it.
p318
aVBut I wanted people to actually
p319
aVfeel my work from their gut,
p320
aVbecause I was painting it from my gut.
p321
aVIf they wanted beauty,
p322
aVI said, this is the beauty I'm willing to give you. It's politicized.
p323
aVOf course, none of them liked it.
p324
aa(lp325
VMy works also turned autobiographical.
p326
aVAt this point, something else happened.
p327
aVA very, very dear friend of mine
p328
aVcame out of the closet,
p329
aVand in India at that time, it was illegal to be gay,
p330
aVand it's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person.
p331
aVI was very upset.
p332
aVI remember the time when my mother used to dress me up
p333
aVas a little girl \u2014 that's me there \u2014
p334
aVbecause she wanted a girl, and she has only boys.
p335
aV(Laughter)
p336
aVAnyway, I don't know what my friends are going to say after this talk.
p337
aVIt's a secret.
p338
aa(lp339
VSo, after this, my works turned a little violent.
p340
aVI talked about this masculinity that one need not perform.
p341
aVAnd I talked about the weakness of male sexuality.
p342
aVThis time, not only did my collectors disappear,
p343
aVthe political activists decided to ban me
p344
aVand to threaten me
p345
aVand to forbid me from showing.
p346
aVIt turned nasty, and I'm a bit of a chicken.
p347
aVI can't deal with any threat. This was a big threat.
p348
aa(lp349
VSo, I decided it was time
p350
aVto end and go back home.
p351
aVThis time I said let's try something different.
p352
aVI need to be reborn again.
p353
aVAnd I thought the best way, as most of you know who have children,
p354
aVthe best way to have a new lease on life,
p355
aVis to have a child.
p356
aVI decided to have a child,
p357
aVand before I did that, I quickly studied what can go wrong.
p358
aVHow can a family get dysfunctional?
p359
aVAnd Rudra was born.
p360
aVThat's my little son.
p361
aa(lp362
VAnd two magical things happened after he was born.
p363
aVMy mother miraculously recovered
p364
aVafter a serious operation,
p365
aVand this man was elected president of this country.
p366
aVYou know I sat at home and I watched.
p367
aVI teared up and I said that's where I want to be.
p368
aVSo Netra and I wound up our life,
p369
aVclosed up everything we had,
p370
aVand we decided to move to New York.
p371
aVAnd this was just eight months ago.
p372
aa(lp373
VI moved back to New York, my work has changed.
p374
aVEverything about my work has become more whimsical.
p375
aVThis one is called "What the Fuck Was I Thinking?"
p376
aVIt talks about mental incest.
p377
aVYou know, I may appear to be a very nice, clean, sweet boy.
p378
aVBut I'm not. I'm capable of thinking anything.
p379
aVBut I'm very civil in my action, I assure you.
p380
aV(Laughter)
p381
aVThese are just different cartoons.
p382
aa(lp383
VAnd, before I go, I want to tell you a little story.
p384
aVI was talking to mother and father this morning,
p385
aVand my dad said, "I know you have so much you want to say,
p386
aVbut you have to talk about your work with children."
p387
aVSo I said, okay.
p388
aa(lp389
VI work with children all over the world,
p390
aVand that's an entirely different talk,
p391
aVbut I want to leave you with one story
p392
aVthat really, really inspired me.
p393
aVI met Belinda when she was 16.
p394
aVI was 17.
p395
aVI was in Australia,
p396
aVand Belinda had cancer,
p397
aVand I was told she's not going to live very long.
p398
aVThey, in fact, told me three weeks.
p399
aVI walk into her room, and there was a shy girl,
p400
aVand she was bald, and she was trying to hide her baldness.
p401
aVI whipped out my pen, and I started drawing on her head
p402
aVand I drew a crown for her.
p403
aVAnd then, we started talking, and we spent a lovely time \u2014
p404
aVI told her how I ended up in Australia,
p405
aVhow I backpacked and who I conned, and how I got a ticket,
p406
aVand all the stories.
p407
aVAnd I drew it out for her.
p408
aVAnd then I left.
p409
aVBelinda died
p410
aVand within a few days of her death,
p411
aVthey published a book for her,
p412
aVand she used my cartoon on the cover.
p413
aVAnd she wrote a little note, she said,
p414
aV"Hey Rags, thank you for the magic carpet ride around the world."
p415
aa(lp416
VFor me, my art is my magic carpet ride.
p417
aVI hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride,
p418
aVand touch children and be honest.
p419
aVThank you so much.
