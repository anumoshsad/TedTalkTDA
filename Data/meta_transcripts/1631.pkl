VI essentially drag sledges for a living,
p4
aVso it doesn't take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually,
p5
aVbut I'm going to read this question
p6
aVfrom an interview earlier this year:
p7
aV"Philosophically, does the constant supply of information
p8
aVsteal our ability to imagine
p9
aVor replace our dreams of achieving?
p10
aVAfter all, if it is being done somewhere by someone,
p11
aVand we can participate virtually,
p12
aVthen why bother leaving the house?"
p13
aa(lp14
VI'm usually introduced as a polar explorer.
p15
aVI'm not sure that's the most progressive or 21st-century
p16
aVof job titles, but I've spent more than two percent now
p17
aVof my entire life living in a tent inside the Arctic Circle,
p18
aVso I get out of the house a fair bit.
p19
aVAnd in my nature, I guess, I am a doer of things
p20
aVmore than I am a spectator or a contemplator of things,
p21
aVand it's that dichotomy, the gulf between ideas and action
p22
aVthat I'm going to try and explore briefly.
p23
aa(lp24
VThe pithiest answer to the question "why?"
p25
aVthat's been dogging me for the last 12 years
p26
aVwas credited certainly to this chap, the rakish-looking gentleman
p27
aVstanding at the back, second from the left,
p28
aVGeorge Lee Mallory. Many of you will know his name.
p29
aVIn 1924 he was last seen disappearing into the clouds
p30
aVnear the summit of Mt. Everest.
p31
aVHe may or may not have been the first person to climb Everest,
p32
aVmore than 30 years before Edmund Hillary.
p33
aVNo one knows if he got to the top. It's still a mystery.
p34
aVBut he was credited with coining the phrase, "Because it's there."
p35
aVNow I'm not actually sure that he did say that.
p36
aVThere's very little evidence to suggest it, but what he did say
p37
aVis actually far nicer,
p38
aVand again, I've printed this. I'm going to read it out.
p39
aa(lp40
V"The first question which you will ask
p41
aVand which I must try to answer is this:
p42
aVWhat is the use of climbing Mt. Everest?
p43
aVAnd my answer must at once be, it is no use.
p44
aVThere is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever.
p45
aVOh, we may learn a little about the behavior
p46
aVof the human body at high altitudes,
p47
aVand possibly medical men may turn our observation
p48
aVto some account for the purposes of aviation,
p49
aVbut otherwise nothing will come of it.
p50
aVWe shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver,
p51
aVand not a gem, nor any coal or iron.
p52
aVWe shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted
p53
aVwith crops to raise food. So it is no use.
p54
aVIf you cannot understand that there is something in man
p55
aVwhich responds to the challenge of this mountain
p56
aVand goes out to meet it, that the struggle
p57
aVis the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward,
p58
aVthen you won't see why we go.
p59
aVWhat we get from this adventure is just sheer joy,
p60
aVand joy, after all, is the end of life.
p61
aVWe don't live to eat and make money.
p62
aVWe eat and make money to be able to enjoy life.
p63
aVThat is what life means, and that is what life is for."
p64
aa(lp65
VMallory's argument that leaving the house,
p66
aVembarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun,
p67
aVhowever, doesn't tally that neatly with my own experience.
p68
aVThe furthest I've ever got away from my front door
p69
aVwas in the spring of 2004. I still don't know exactly
p70
aVwhat came over me, but my plan was to make
p71
aVa solo and unsupported crossing of the Arctic Ocean.
p72
aVI planned essentially to walk from the north coast of Russia
p73
aVto the North Pole, and then to carry on to the north coast of Canada.
p74
aVNo one had ever done this. I was 26 at the time.
p75
aVA lot of experts were saying it was impossible,
p76
aVand my mum certainly wasn't very keen on the idea.
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VThe journey from a small weather station on the north coast
p80
aVof Siberia up to my final starting point,
p81
aVthe edge of the pack ice, the coast of the Arctic Ocean,
p82
aVtook about five hours, and if anyone watched fearless
p83
aVFelix Baumgartner going up, rather than just coming down,
p84
aVyou'll appreciate the sense of apprehension,
p85
aVas I sat in a helicopter thundering north,
p86
aVand the sense, I think if anything, of impending doom.
p87
aVI sat there wondering what on Earth I had gotten myself into.
p88
aVThere was a bit of fun, a bit of joy.
p89
aVI was 26. I remember sitting there
p90
aVlooking down at my sledge. I had my skis ready to go,
p91
aVI had a satellite phone, a pump-action shotgun
p92
aVin case I was attacked by a polar bear.
p93
aVI remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter.
p94
aVWe were both thundering through this incredible Siberian dawn,
p95
aVand part of me felt a bit like a cross between Jason Bourne
p96
aVand Wilfred Thesiger. Part of me
p97
aVfelt quite proud of myself, but mostly I was just utterly terrified.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd that journey lasted 10 weeks, 72 days.
p100
aVI didn't see anyone else. We took this photo next to the helicopter.
p101
aVBeyond that, I didn't see anyone for 10 weeks.
p102
aVThe North Pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea,
p103
aVso I'm traveling over the frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean.
p104
aVNASA described conditions that year as the worst since records began.
p105
aVI was dragging 180 kilos of food and fuel and supplies,
p106
aVabout 400 pounds. The average temperature for the 10 weeks
p107
aVwas minus 35. Minus 50 was the coldest.
p108
aVSo again, there wasn't an awful lot of joy or fun to be had.
p109
aa(lp110
VOne of the magical things about this journey, however,
p111
aVis that because I'm walking over the sea,
p112
aVover this floating, drifting, shifting crust of ice
p113
aVthat's floating on top of the Arctic Ocean is
p114
aVit's an environment that's in a constant state of flux.
p115
aVThe ice is always moving, breaking up, drifting around,
p116
aVrefreezing, so the scenery that I saw for nearly 3 months
p117
aVwas unique to me. No one else will ever, could ever,
p118
aVpossibly see the views, the vistas, that I saw for 10 weeks.
p119
aVAnd that, I guess, is probably the finest argument for leaving the house.
p120
aVI can try to tell you what it was like,
p121
aVbut you'll never know what it was like,
p122
aVand the more I try to explain that I felt lonely,
p123
aVI was the only human being in 5.4 million square-miles,
p124
aVit was cold, nearly minus 75 with windchill on a bad day,
p125
aVthe more words fall short, and I'm unable to do it justice.
p126
aVAnd it seems to me, therefore, that the doing,
p127
aVyou know, to try to experience, to engage, to endeavor,
p128
aVrather than to watch and to wonder, that's where
p129
aVthe real meat of life is to be found,
p130
aVthe juice that we can suck out of our hours and days.
p131
aVAnd I would add a cautionary note here, however.
p132
aVIn my experience, there is something addictive
p133
aVabout tasting life at the very edge of what's humanly possible.
p134
aVNow I don't just mean in the field of
p135
aVdaft macho Edwardian style derring-do,
p136
aVbut also in the fields of pancreatic cancer,
p137
aVthere is something addictive about this, and in my case,
p138
aVI think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed
p139
aVfrom having a crack habit.
p140
aVI can't explain quite how good it is until you've tried it,
p141
aVbut it has the capacity to burn up all the money I can get my hands on,
p142
aVto ruin every relationship I've ever had,
p143
aVso be careful what you wish for.
p144
aa(lp145
VMallory postulated that there is something in man
p146
aVthat responds to the challenge of the mountain,
p147
aVand I wonder if that's the case whether there's something
p148
aVin the challenge itself, in the endeavor, and particularly
p149
aVin the big, unfinished, chunky challenges that face humanity
p150
aVthat call out to us, and in my experience that's certainly the case.
p151
aVThere is one unfinished challenge
p152
aVthat's been calling out to me for most of my adult life.
p153
aa(lp154
VMany of you will know the story.
p155
aVThis is a photo of Captain Scott and his team.
p156
aVScott set out just over a hundred years ago to try
p157
aVto become the first person to reach the South Pole.
p158
aVNo one knew what was there. It was utterly unmapped
p159
aVat the time. We knew more about the surface of the moon
p160
aVthan we did about the heart of Antarctica.
p161
aVScott, as many of you will know, was beaten to it
p162
aVby Roald Amundsen and his Norwegian team,
p163
aVwho used dogs and dogsleds. Scott's team were on foot,
p164
aVall five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges,
p165
aVand they arrived at the pole to find the Norwegian flag already there,
p166
aVI'd imagine pretty bitter and demoralized.
p167
aVAll five of them turned and started walking back to the coast
p168
aVand all five died on that return journey.
p169
aa(lp170
VThere is a sort of misconception nowadays that
p171
aVit's all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure.
p172
aVWhen I talk about Antarctica, people often say,
p173
aV"Hasn't, you know, that's interesting,
p174
aVhasn't that Blue Peter presenter just done it on a bike?"
p175
aVOr, "That's nice. You know, my grandmother's going
p176
aVon a cruise to Antarctica next year. You know.
p177
aVIs there a chance you'll see her there?"
p178
aV(Laughter)
p179
aa(lp180
VBut Scott's journey remains unfinished.
p181
aVNo one has ever walked from the very coast of Antarctica
p182
aVto the South Pole and back again.
p183
aVIt is, arguably, the most audacious endeavor
p184
aVof that Edwardian golden age of exploration,
p185
aVand it seemed to me high time, given everything
p186
aVwe have figured out in the century since
p187
aVfrom scurvy to solar panels, that it was high time
p188
aVsomeone had a go at finishing the job.
p189
aVSo that's precisely what I'm setting out to do.
p190
aa(lp191
VThis time next year, in October, I'm leading a team of three.
p192
aVIt will take us about four months to make this return journey.
p193
aVThat's the scale. The red line is obviously halfway to the pole.
p194
aVWe have to turn around and come back again.
p195
aVI'm well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be
p196
aVblogging and tweeting. You'll be able to live
p197
aVvicariously and virtually through this journey
p198
aVin a way that no one has ever before.
p199
aVAnd it'll also be a four-month chance for me to finally
p200
aVcome up with a pithy answer to the question, "Why?"
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd our lives today are safer and more comfortable
p203
aVthan they have ever been. There certainly isn't much call
p204
aVfor explorers nowadays. My career advisor at school
p205
aVnever mentioned it as an option.
p206
aVIf I wanted to know, for example,
p207
aVhow many stars were in the Milky Way,
p208
aVhow old those giant heads on Easter Island were,
p209
aVmost of you could find that out right now
p210
aVwithout even standing up.
p211
aVAnd yet, if I've learned anything in nearly 12 years now
p212
aVof dragging heavy things around cold places,
p213
aVit is that true, real inspiration and growth
p214
aVonly comes from adversity and from challenge,
p215
aVfrom stepping away from what's comfortable and familiar
p216
aVand stepping out into the unknown.
p217
aVIn life, we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to,
p218
aVand I think metaphorically speaking, at least,
p219
aVwe could all benefit from getting outside the house
p220
aVa little more often, if only we could summon up the courage.
p221
aVI certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit
p222
aVand take a look at what's outside.
p223
aVThank you very much.
