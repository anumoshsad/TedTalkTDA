VSo this right here
p4
aVis the tiny village of Elle, close to Lista.
p5
aVIt's right at the southernmost tip of Norway.
p6
aVAnd on January 2 this year,
p7
aVan elderly guy who lives in the village,
p8
aVhe went out to see what was cast ashore
p9
aVduring a recent storm.
p10
aVAnd on a patch of grass right next to the water's edge,
p11
aVhe found a wetsuit.
p12
aVIt was grey and black, and he thought it looked cheap.
p13
aVOut of each leg of the wetsuit
p14
aVthere were sticking two white bones.
p15
aVIt was clearly the remains of a human being.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd usually, in Norway, dead people are identified quickly.
p18
aVSo the police started searching
p19
aVthrough missing reports from the local area,
p20
aVnational missing reports,
p21
aVand looked for accidents with a possible connection.
p22
aVThey found nothing.
p23
aVSo they ran a DNA profile,
p24
aVand they started searching internationally through Interpol.
p25
aVNothing.
p26
aVThis was a person that nobody seemed to be missing.
p27
aVIt was an invisible life heading for a nameless grave.
p28
aVBut then, after a month,
p29
aVthe police in Norway got a message from the police in the Netherlands.
p30
aVA couple of months earlier, they had found a body,
p31
aVin an identical wetsuit, and they had no idea who this person was.
p32
aVBut the police in the Netherlands managed to trace the wetsuit
p33
aVby an RFID chip that was sewn in the suit.
p34
aVSo they were then able to tell
p35
aVthat both wetsuits were bought by the same customer at the same time,
p36
aVOctober 7, 2014,
p37
aVin the French city of Calais by the English Channel.
p38
aVBut this was all they were able to figure out.
p39
aVThe customer paid cash.
p40
aVThere was no surveillance footage from the shop.
p41
aVSo it became a cold case.
p42
aa(lp43
VWe heard this story,
p44
aVand it triggered me and my colleague, photographer Tomm Christiansen,
p45
aVand we of course had the obvious question: who were these people?
p46
aVAt the time, I'd barely heard about Calais,
p47
aVbut it took about two or three seconds to figure out
p48
aVCalais is basically known for two things.
p49
aVIt's the spot in continental Europe closest to Britain,
p50
aVand a lot of migrants and refugees are staying in this camp
p51
aVand are trying desperately to cross over to Britain.
p52
aVAnd right there was a plausible theory about the identity of the two people,
p53
aVand the police made this theory as well.
p54
aVBecause if you or I or anybody else with a firm connection to Europe
p55
aVgoes missing off the coast of France, people would just know.
p56
aVYour friends or family would report you missing,
p57
aVthe police would come search for you, the media would know,
p58
aVand there would be pictures of you on lampposts.
p59
aVIt's difficult to disappear without a trace.
p60
aVBut if you just fled the war in Syria,
p61
aVand your family, if you have any family left,
p62
aVdon't necessarily know where you are,
p63
aVand you're staying here illegally
p64
aVamongst thousands of others who come and go every day.
p65
aVWell, if you disappear one day, nobody will notice.
p66
aVThe police won't come search for you because nobody knows you're gone.
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd this is what happened to Shadi Omar Kataf
p69
aVand Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.
p70
aa(lp71
VMe and Tomm went to Calais for the first time in April this year,
p72
aVand after three months of investigation, we were able to tell the story
p73
aVabout how these two young men fled the war in Syria,
p74
aVended up stuck in Calais,
p75
aVbought wetsuits and drowned in what seems to have been an attempt
p76
aVto swim across the English Channel in order to reach England.
p77
aVIt is a story about the fact that everybody has a name,
p78
aVeverybody has a story, everybody is someone.
p79
aVBut it is also a story about what it's like to be a refugee in Europe today.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo this is where we started our search.
p82
aVThis is in Calais.
p83
aVRight now, between 3,500 and 5,000 people are living here
p84
aVunder horrible conditions.
p85
aVIt has been dubbed the worst refugee camp in Europe.
p86
aVLimited access to food, limited access to water,
p87
aVlimited access to health care.
p88
aVDisease and infections are widespread.
p89
aVAnd they're all stuck here because they're trying to get to England
p90
aVin order to claim asylum.
p91
aVAnd they do that by hiding in the back of trucks headed for the ferry,
p92
aVor the Eurotunnel,
p93
aVor they sneak inside the tunnel terminal at night
p94
aVto try to hide on the trains.
p95
aa(lp96
VMost want to go to Britain because they know the language,
p97
aVand so they figure it would be easier to restart their lives from there.
p98
aVThey want to work, they want to study,
p99
aVthey want to be able to continue their lives.
p100
aVA lot of these people are highly educated and skilled workers.
p101
aVIf you go to Calais and talk to refugees, you'll meet lawyers, politicians,
p102
aVengineers, graphic designers, farmers, soldiers.
p103
aVYou've got the whole spectrum.
p104
aVBut who all of these people are
p105
aVusually gets lost in the way we talk about refugees and migrants,
p106
aVbecause we usually do that in statistics.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo you have 60 million refugees globally.
p109
aVAbout half a million have made the crossing
p110
aVover the Mediterranean into Europe so far this year,
p111
aVand roughly 4,000 are staying in Calais.
p112
aVBut these are numbers,
p113
aVand the numbers don't say anything about who these people are,
p114
aVwhere they came from, or why they're here.
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd first, I want to tell you about one of them.
p117
aVThis is 22-year-old Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria.
p118
aVWe first heard about him after being in Calais the first time
p119
aVlooking for answers to the theory of the two dead bodies.
p120
aVAnd after a while, we heard this story
p121
aVabout a Syrian man who was living in Bradford in England,
p122
aVand had been desperately searching for his nephew Mouaz for months.
p123
aVAnd it turned out the last time anybody had heard anything from Mouaz
p124
aVwas October 7, 2014.
p125
aVThat was the same date the wetsuits were bought.
p126
aVSo we flew over there and we met the uncle
p127
aVand we did DNA samples of him,
p128
aVand later on got additional DNA samples from Mouaz's closest relative
p129
aVwho now lives in Jordan.
p130
aVThe analysis concluded
p131
aVthe body who was found in a wetsuit on a beach in the Netherlands
p132
aVwas actually Mouaz Al Balkhi.
p133
aVAnd while we were doing all this investigation,
p134
aVwe got to know Mouaz's story.
p135
aVHe was born in the Syrian capital of Damascus in 1991.
p136
aVHe was raised in a middle class family,
p137
aVand his father in the middle there is a chemical engineer
p138
aVwho spent 11 years in prison for belonging to the political opposition in Syria.
p139
aVWhile his father was in prison,
p140
aVMouaz took responsibility and he cared for his three sisters.
p141
aVThey said he was that kind of guy.
p142
aVMouaz studied to become an electrical engineer
p143
aVat the University of Damascus.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo a couple of years into the Syrian war,
p146
aVthe family fled Damascus and went to the neighboring country, Jordan.
p147
aVTheir father had problems finding work in Jordan,
p148
aVand Mouaz could not continue his studies,
p149
aVso he figured, "OK, the best thing I can do to help my family
p150
aVwould be to go somewhere where I can finish my studies
p151
aVand find work."
p152
aVSo he goes to Turkey.
p153
aa(lp154
VIn Turkey, he's not accepted at a university,
p155
aVand once he had left Jordan as a refugee, he was not allowed to reenter.
p156
aVSo then he decides to head for the UK,
p157
aVwhere his uncle lives.
p158
aVHe makes it into Algeria, walks into Libya,
p159
aVpays a people smuggler to help him with the crossing into Italy by boat,
p160
aVand from there on he heads to Dunkirk,
p161
aVthe city right next to Calais by the English Channel.
p162
aVWe know he made at least 12 failed attempts to cross the English Channel
p163
aVby hiding in a truck.
p164
aVBut at some point, he must have given up all hope.
p165
aVThe last night we know he was alive,
p166
aVhe spent at a cheap hotel close to the train station in Dunkirk.
p167
aVWe found his name in the records, and he seems to have stayed there alone.
p168
aVThe day after, he went into Calais, entered a sports shop
p169
aVa couple of minutes before 8 o'clock in the evening,
p170
aValong with Shadi Kataf.
p171
aVThey both bought wetsuits,
p172
aVand the woman in the shop
p173
aVwas the last person we know of to have seen them alive.
p174
aVWe have tried to figure out where Shadi met Mouaz,
p175
aVbut we weren't able to do that.
p176
aVBut they do have a similar story.
p177
aVWe first heard about Shadi after a cousin of his, living in Germany,
p178
aVhad read an Arabic translation of the story made of Mouaz on Facebook.
p179
aVSo we got in touch with him.
p180
aVShadi, a couple of years older than Mouaz,
p181
aVwas also raised in Damascus.
p182
aVHe was a working kind of guy.
p183
aVHe ran a tire repair shop and later worked in a printing company.
p184
aVHe lived with his extended family,
p185
aVbut their house got bombed early in the war.
p186
aVSo the family fled to an area of Damascus known as Camp Yarmouk.
p187
aa(lp188
VYarmouk is being described as the worst place to live
p189
aVon planet Earth.
p190
aVThey've been bombed by the military, they've been besieged,
p191
aVthey've been stormed by ISIS
p192
aVand they've been cut off from supplies for years.
p193
aVThere was a UN official who visited last year,
p194
aVand he said, "They ate all the grass so there was no grass left."
p195
aVOut of a population of 150,000,
p196
aVonly 18,000 are believed to still be left in Yarmouk.
p197
aVShadi and his sisters got out.
p198
aVThe parents are still stuck inside.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo Shadi and one of his sisters, they fled to Libya.
p201
aVThis was after the fall of Gaddafi,
p202
aVbut before Libya turned into full-blown civil war.
p203
aVAnd in this last remaining sort of stability in Libya,
p204
aVShadi took up scuba diving, and he seemed to spend most of his time underwater.
p205
aVHe fell completely in love with the ocean,
p206
aVso when he finally decided that he could no longer be in Libya,
p207
aVlate August 2014,
p208
aVhe hoped to find work as a diver when he reached Italy.
p209
aVReality was not that easy.
p210
aVWe don't know much about his travels
p211
aVbecause he had a hard time communicating with his family,
p212
aVbut we do know that he struggled.
p213
aVAnd by the end of September,
p214
aVhe was living on the streets somewhere in France.
p215
aVOn October 7, he calls his cousin in Belgium,
p216
aVand explains his situation.
p217
aVHe said, "I'm in Calais. I need you to come get my backpack and my laptop.
p218
aVI can't afford to pay the people smugglers to help me with the crossing to Britain,
p219
aVbut I will go buy a wetsuit and I will swim."
p220
aVHis cousin, of course, tried to warn him not to,
p221
aVbut Shadi's battery on the phone went flat,
p222
aVand his phone was never switched on again.
p223
aVWhat was left of Shadi was found nearly three months later,
p224
aV800 kilometers away
p225
aVin a wetsuit on a beach in Norway.
p226
aVHe's still waiting for his funeral in Norway,
p227
aVand none of his family will be able to attend.
p228
aa(lp229
VMany may think that the story about Shadi and Mouaz
p230
aVis a story about death,
p231
aVbut I don't agree.
p232
aVTo me, this is a story about two questions that I think we all share:
p233
aVwhat is a better life,
p234
aVand what am I willing to do to achieve it?
p235
aVAnd to me, and probably a lot of you,
p236
aVa better life would mean
p237
aVbeing able to do more of what we think of as meaningful,
p238
aVwhether that be spending more time with your family and friends,
p239
aVtravel to an exotic place,
p240
aVor just getting money to buy that cool new device
p241
aVor a pair of new sneakers.
p242
aVAnd this is all within our reach pretty easily.
p243
aa(lp244
VBut if you are fleeing a war zone,
p245
aVthe answers to those two questions are dramatically different.
p246
aVA better life is a life in safety.
p247
aVIt's a life in dignity.
p248
aVA better life means not having your house bombed,
p249
aVnot fearing being kidnapped.
p250
aVIt means being able to send your children to school,
p251
aVgo to university,
p252
aVor just find work to be able to provide for yourself and the ones you love.
p253
aVA better life would be a future of some possibilities
p254
aVcompared to nearly none,
p255
aVand that's a strong motivation.
p256
aVAnd I have no trouble imagining
p257
aVthat after spending weeks or even months
p258
aVas a second-grade citizen,
p259
aVliving on the streets or in a horrible makeshift camp
p260
aVwith a stupid, racist name like "The Jungle,"
p261
aVmost of us would be willing to do just about anything.
p262
aVIf I could ask Shadi and Mouaz
p263
aVthe second they stepped into the freezing waters of the English Channel,
p264
aVthey would probably say, "This is worth the risk,"
p265
aVbecause they could no longer see any other option.
p266
aVAnd that's desperation,
p267
aVbut that's the reality of living as a refugee in Western Europe in 2015.
p268
aa(lp269
VThank you.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Applause)
p272
aa(lp273
VBruno Giussani: Thank you, Anders.
p274
aVThis is Tomm Christiansen,
p275
aVwho took most of the pictures you have seen and they've done reporting together.
p276
aVTomm, you two have been back to Calais recently.
p277
aVThis was the third trip.
p278
aVIt was after the publication of the article.
p279
aVWhat has changed? What have you seen there?
p280
aa(lp281
VTomm Christiansen: The first time we were in Calais,
p282
aVit was about 1,500 refugees there.
p283
aVThey had a difficult time, but they were positive, they had hope.
p284
aVThe last time, the camp has grown, maybe four or five thousand people.
p285
aVIt seemed more permanent, NGOs have arrived,
p286
aVa small school has opened.
p287
aVBut the thing is that the refugees have stayed for a longer time,
p288
aVand the French government has managed to seal off the borders better,
p289
aVso now The Jungle is growing,
p290
aValong with the despair and hopelessness among the refugees.
p291
aa(lp292
VBG: Are you planning to go back? And continue the reporting?
p293
aa(lp294
VTC: Yes.
p295
aa(lp296
VBG: Anders, I'm a former journalist,
p297
aVand to me, it's amazing that in the current climate
p298
aVof slashing budgets and publishers in crisis,
p299
aVDagbladet has consented so many resources for this story,
p300
aVwhich tells a lot about newspapers taking the responsibility,
p301
aVbut how did you sell it to your editors?
p302
aa(lp303
VAnders Fjellberg: It wasn't easy at first,
p304
aVbecause we weren't able to know what we actually could figure out.
p305
aVAs soon as it became clear
p306
aVthat we actually could be able to identify who the first one was,
p307
aVwe basically got the message that we could do whatever we wanted,
p308
aVjust travel wherever you need to go, do whatever you need to do,
p309
aVjust get this done.
p310
aa(lp311
VBG: That's an editor taking responsibility.
p312
aVThe story, by the way, has been translated and published
p313
aVacross several European countries, and certainly will continue to do.
p314
aVAnd we want to read the updates from you. Thank you Anders. Thank you Tomm.
