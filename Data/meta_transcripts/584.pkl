VI'm going to talk about post-conflict recovery
p4
aVand how we might do post-conflict recovery better.
p5
aVThe record on post-conflict recovery is not very impressive.
p6
aV40 percent of all post-conflict situations,
p7
aVhistorically, have reverted back to conflict within a decade.
p8
aVIn fact, they've accounted for half of all civil wars.
p9
aVWhy has the record been so poor?
p10
aVWell, the conventional approach
p11
aVto post-conflict situations
p12
aVhas rested on, on kind of, three principles.
p13
aa(lp14
VThe first principle is: it's the politics that matters.
p15
aVSo, the first thing that is prioritized is politics.
p16
aVTry and build a political settlement first.
p17
aVAnd then the second step is to say,
p18
aV"The situation is admittedly dangerous, but only for a short time."
p19
aVSo get peacekeepers there, but get them home as soon as possible.
p20
aVSo, short-term peacekeepers.
p21
aVAnd thirdly, what is the exit strategy for the peacekeepers?
p22
aVIt's an election.
p23
aVThat will produce a legitimate and accountable government.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo that's the conventional approach.
p26
aVI think that approach denies reality.
p27
aVWe see that there is no quick fix.
p28
aVThere's certainly no quick security fix.
p29
aVI've tried to look at the risks of reversion to conflict,
p30
aVduring our post-conflict decade.
p31
aVAnd the risks stay high throughout the decade.
p32
aVAnd they stay high regardless of the political innovations.
p33
aVDoes an election produce an accountable and legitimate government?
p34
aVWhat an election produces is a winner and a loser.
p35
aVAnd the loser is unreconciled.
p36
aVThe reality is that we need to reverse the sequence.
p37
aVIt's not the politics first;
p38
aVit's actually the politics last.
p39
aVThe politics become easier as the decade progresses
p40
aVif you're building on a foundation
p41
aVof security and economic development \u2014
p42
aVthe rebuilding of prosperity.
p43
aa(lp44
VWhy does the politics get easier?
p45
aVAnd why is it so difficult initially?
p46
aVBecause after years of stagnation and decline,
p47
aVthe mentality of politics is that it's a zero-sum game.
p48
aVIf the reality is stagnation,
p49
aVI can only go up if you go down.
p50
aVAnd that doesn't produce a productive politics.
p51
aVAnd so the mentality has to shift from
p52
aVzero-sum to positive-sum
p53
aVbefore you can get a productive politics.
p54
aVYou can only get positive, that mental shift,
p55
aVif the reality is that prosperity is being built.
p56
aVAnd in order to build prosperity, we need security in place.
p57
aVSo that is what you get when you face reality.
p58
aVBut the objective of facing reality
p59
aVis to change reality.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd so now let me suggest
p62
aVtwo complimentary approaches
p63
aVto changing the reality of the situations.
p64
aVThe first is to recognize the interdependence
p65
aVof three key actors, who are different actors,
p66
aVand at the moment are uncoordinated.
p67
aVThe first actor is the Security Council.
p68
aVThe Security Council typically has the responsibility
p69
aVfor providing the peacekeepers
p70
aVwho build the security.
p71
aVAnd that needs to be recognized,
p72
aVfirst of all, that peacekeeping works.
p73
aVIt is a cost-effective approach.
p74
aVIt does increase security.
p75
aVBut it needs to be done long-term.
p76
aVIt needs to be a decade-long approach,
p77
aVrather than just a couple of years.
p78
aVThat's one actor, the Security Council.
p79
aa(lp80
VThe second actor, different cast of guys,
p81
aVis the donors.
p82
aVThe donors provide post-conflict aid.
p83
aVTypically in the past,
p84
aVthe donors have been interested in the first couple of years,
p85
aVand then they got bored.
p86
aVThey moved on to some other situation.
p87
aVPost-conflict economic recovery
p88
aVis a slow process.
p89
aVThere are no quick processes in economics
p90
aVexcept decline.
p91
aVYou can do that quite fast.
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aVSo the donors have to stick with this situation
p94
aVfor at least a decade.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd then the third key actor
p97
aVis the post-conflict government.
p98
aVAnd there are two key things it's got to do.
p99
aVOne is it's got to do economic reform,
p100
aVnot fuss about the political constitution.
p101
aVIt's got to reform economic policy.
p102
aVWhy? Because during conflict
p103
aVeconomic policy typically deteriorates.
p104
aVGovernments snatch short-term opportunities
p105
aVand, by the end of the conflict, the chickens have come home to roost.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo this legacy of conflict is really bad economic policy.
p108
aVSo there is a reform agenda, and there is an inclusion agenda.
p109
aVThe inclusion agenda doesn't come from elections.
p110
aVElections produce a loser, who is then excluded.
p111
aVSo the inclusion agenda means genuinely
p112
aVbringing people inside the tent.
p113
aVSo those three actors.
p114
aVAnd they are interdependent
p115
aVover a long term.
p116
aVIf the Security Council doesn't commit to security
p117
aVover the course of a decade,
p118
aVyou don't get the reassurance which produces private investment.
p119
aVIf you don't get the policy reform and the aid,
p120
aVyou don't get the economic recovery,
p121
aVwhich is the true exit strategy for the peacekeepers.
p122
aVSo we should recognize that interdependence,
p123
aVby formal, mutual commitments.
p124
aVThe United Nations actually has a language
p125
aVfor these mutual commitments, the recognition of mutual commitments;
p126
aVit's called the language of compact.
p127
aVAnd so we need a post-conflict compact.
p128
aVThe United Nations even has an agency which could broker these compacts;
p129
aVit's called the Peace Building Commission.
p130
aa(lp131
VIt would be ideal to have a standard set of norms
p132
aVwhere, when we got to a post-conflict situation,
p133
aVthere was an expectation of these mutual commitments
p134
aVfrom the three parties.
p135
aVSo that's idea one:
p136
aVrecognize interdependence.
p137
aVAnd now let me turn to the second approach, which is complimentary.
p138
aVAnd that is to focus on a few critical objectives.
p139
aVTypical post-conflict situation is a zoo
p140
aVof different actors with different priorities.
p141
aVAnd indeed, unfortunately, if you navigate by needs
p142
aVyou get a very unfocused agenda,
p143
aVbecause in these situations, needs are everywhere,
p144
aVbut the capacity to implement change is very limited.
p145
aVSo we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd I want to suggest that in the typical post-conflict situation
p148
aVthree things are critical.
p149
aVOne is jobs.
p150
aVOne is improvements in basic services \u2014
p151
aVespecially health, which is a disaster during conflict.
p152
aVSo jobs, health, and clean government.
p153
aVThose are the three critical priorities.
p154
aVSo I'm going to talk a little about each of them.
p155
aa(lp156
VJobs.
p157
aVWhat is a distinctive approach
p158
aVto generating jobs in post-conflict situations?
p159
aVAnd why are jobs so important?
p160
aVJobs for whom? Especially jobs for young men.
p161
aVIn post-conflict situations,
p162
aVthe reason that they so often revert to conflict,
p163
aVis not because elderly women get upset.
p164
aVIt's because young men get upset.
p165
aVAnd why are they upset? Because they have nothing to do.
p166
aVAnd so we need a process of generating jobs,
p167
aVfor ordinary young men, fast.
p168
aVNow, that is difficult.
p169
aVGovernments in post-conflict situation
p170
aVoften respond by puffing up the civil service.
p171
aVThat is not a good idea.
p172
aVIt's not sustainable.
p173
aVIn fact, you're building a long-term liability
p174
aVby inflating civil service.
p175
aVBut getting the private sector to expand is also difficult,
p176
aVbecause any activity which is open to international trade
p177
aVis basically going to be uncompetitive
p178
aVin a post-conflict situation.
p179
aVThese are not environments where you can build export manufacturing.
p180
aa(lp181
VThere's one sector which isn't exposed to international trade,
p182
aVand which can generate a lot of jobs,
p183
aVand which is, in any case, a sensible sector
p184
aVto expand, post-conflict,
p185
aVand that is the construction sector.
p186
aVThe construction sector has a vital role,
p187
aVobviously, in reconstruction.
p188
aVBut typically that sector has withered away during conflict.
p189
aVDuring conflict people are doing destruction.
p190
aVThere isn't any construction going on. And so the sector shrivels away.
p191
aVAnd then when you try and expand it,
p192
aVbecause it's shriveled away,
p193
aVyou encounter a lot of bottlenecks.
p194
aVBasically, prices soar
p195
aVand crooked politicians then milk the rents from the sector,
p196
aVbut it doesn't generate any jobs.
p197
aVAnd so the policy priority is to break the bottlenecks
p198
aVin expanding the construction sector.
p199
aa(lp200
VWhat might the bottlenecks be?
p201
aVJust think what you have to do
p202
aVsuccessfully to build a structure, using a lot of labor.
p203
aVFirst you need access to land.
p204
aVOften the legal system is broken down
p205
aVso you can't even get access to land.
p206
aVSecondly you need skills,
p207
aVthe mundane skills of the construction sector.
p208
aVIn post-conflict situations we don't just need Doctors Without Borders,
p209
aVwe need Bricklayers Without Borders,
p210
aVto rebuild the skill set.
p211
aVWe need firms. The firms have gone away.
p212
aVSo we need to encourage the growth of local firms.
p213
aVIf we do that, we not only get the jobs,
p214
aVwe get the improvements in public infrastructure,
p215
aVthe restoration of public infrastructure.
p216
aa(lp217
VLet me turn from jobs to the second objective,
p218
aVwhich is improving basic social services.
p219
aVAnd to date, there has been a sort of a schizophrenia
p220
aVin the donor community,
p221
aVas to how to build basic services
p222
aVin post-conflict sectors.
p223
aVOn the one hand it pays lip service
p224
aVto the idea of rebuild an effective state
p225
aVin the image of Scandinavia in the 1950s.
p226
aVLets develop line ministries of this, that, and the other,
p227
aVthat deliver these services.
p228
aVAnd it's schizophrenic because in their hearts
p229
aVdonors know that's not a realistic agenda,
p230
aVand so what they also do is the total bypass:
p231
aVjust fund NGOs.
p232
aa(lp233
VNeither of those approaches is sensible.
p234
aVAnd so what I'd suggest
p235
aVis what I call Independent Service Authorities.
p236
aVIt's to split the functions of a monopoly line ministry up into three.
p237
aVThe planning function and policy function stays with the ministry;
p238
aVthe delivery of services on the ground,
p239
aVyou should use whatever works \u2014
p240
aVchurches, NGOs, local communities,
p241
aVwhatever works.
p242
aVAnd in between, there should be a public agency,
p243
aVthe Independent Service Authority,
p244
aVwhich channels public money,
p245
aVand especially donor money,
p246
aVto the retail providers.
p247
aVSo the NGOs become part of a public government system,
p248
aVrather than independent of it.
p249
aa(lp250
VOne advantage of that is that you can allocate money coherently.
p251
aVAnother is, you can make NGOs accountable.
p252
aVYou can use yardstick competition,
p253
aVso they have to compete against each other
p254
aVfor the resources.
p255
aVThe good NGOs, like Oxfam, are very keen on this idea.
p256
aVThey want to have the discipline and accountability.
p257
aVSo that's a way to get basic services scaled up.
p258
aVAnd because the government would be funding it,
p259
aVit would be co-branding these services.
p260
aVSo they wouldn't be provided thanks to
p261
aVthe United States government and some NGO.
p262
aVThey would be co-branded
p263
aVas being done by the post-conflict government, in the country.
p264
aVSo, jobs, basic services, finally, clean government.
p265
aa(lp266
VClean means follow their money.
p267
aVThe typical post-conflict government is so short of money
p268
aVthat it needs our money
p269
aVjust to be on a life-support system.
p270
aVYou can't get the basic functions of the state done
p271
aVunless we put money into the core budget of these countries.
p272
aVBut, if we put money into the core budget,
p273
aVwe know that there aren't the budget systems with integrity
p274
aVthat mean that money will be well spent.
p275
aVAnd if all we do is put money in and close our eyes
p276
aVit's not just that the money is wasted \u2014
p277
aVthat's the least of the problems \u2014
p278
aVit's that the money is captured.
p279
aVIt's captured by the crooks who are at the heart of the political problem.
p280
aVAnd so inadvertently we empower the people who are the problem.
p281
aa(lp282
VSo building clean government means, yes, provide money
p283
aVto the budget,
p284
aVbut also provide a lot of scrutiny,
p285
aVwhich means a lot of technical assistance that follows the money.
p286
aVPaddy Ashdown, who was the grand high nabob of Bosnia
p287
aVto the United Nations,
p288
aVin his book about his experience, he said,
p289
aV"I realize what I needed
p290
aVwas accountants without borders,
p291
aVto follow that money."
p292
aVSo that's the \u2014 let me wrap up,
p293
aVthis is the package.
p294
aa(lp295
VWhat's the goal?
p296
aVIf we follow this, what would we hope to achieve?
p297
aVThat after 10 years,
p298
aVthe focus on the construction sector
p299
aVwould have produced both jobs
p300
aVand, hence, security \u2014
p301
aVbecause young people would have jobs \u2014
p302
aVand it would have reconstructed the infrastructure.
p303
aVSo that's the focus on the construction sector.
p304
aVThe focus on the basic service delivery
p305
aVthrough these independent service authorities
p306
aVwould have rescued basic services
p307
aVfrom their catastrophic levels,
p308
aVand it would have given ordinary people
p309
aVthe sense that the government was doing something useful.
p310
aVThe emphasis on clean government
p311
aVwould have gradually squeezed out the political crooks,
p312
aVbecause there wouldn't be any money
p313
aVin taking part in the politics.
p314
aVAnd so gradually the selection,
p315
aVthe composition of politicians,
p316
aVwould shift from the crooked to the honest.
p317
aVWhere would that leave us?
p318
aVGradually it would shift
p319
aVfrom a politics of plunder
p320
aVto a politics of hope. Thank you.
