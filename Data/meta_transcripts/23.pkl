VI love trees, and I'm very lucky,
p4
aVbecause we live near a wonderful arboretum,
p5
aVand Sundays, usually, I'd go there with my wife
p6
aVand now, with my four-year-old,
p7
aVand we'd climb in the trees, we'd play hide and seek.
p8
aVThe second school I was at had big trees too,
p9
aVhad a fantastic tulip tree, I think it was the biggest in the country,
p10
aVand it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation
p11
aVaround it, around the playing fields.
p12
aa(lp13
VOne day I was grabbed by some of my classmates,
p14
aVand taken in the bushes \u2014 I was stripped; I was attacked;
p15
aVI was abused; and this came out of the blue.
p16
aVNow, the reason I say that, because, afterwards, I was thinking \u2014
p17
aVwell, I went back into the school \u2014 I felt dirty; I felt betrayed;
p18
aVI felt ashamed, but mainly \u2014 mainly, I felt powerless.
p19
aVAnd 30 years later I was sitting in an airplane,
p20
aVnext to a lady called Veronica, who came from Chile,
p21
aVand we were on a human rights tour,
p22
aVand she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured,
p23
aVand, from my very privileged position,
p24
aVthis was the only reference point that I had.
p25
aVAnd it was an amazing learning experience
p26
aVbecause, for me, human rights have been something in which I had,
p27
aVyou know, a part-time interest, but, mainly,
p28
aVit was something that happened to other people over there.
p29
aa(lp30
VBut I got a phone call from Bono in 1985 and, as you know,
p31
aVhe's a great singer, but he's a magnificent hustler, and \u2014
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter) \u2014
p34
aa(lp35
Va very hard guy to say no to, and he was saying,
p36
aVyou know, just after I'd done the Biko song,
p37
aVwe're going to do a tour for Amnesty,
p38
aVyou have to be on it, and really that was the first time
p39
aVthat I'd been out and started meeting people
p40
aVwho'd watched their family being shot in front of them,
p41
aVwho'd had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean,
p42
aVand suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world,
p43
aVand I couldn't really walk away in quite the same way as before.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo I got involved with this tour, which was for Amnesty,
p46
aVand then in '88 I took over Bono's job trying to learn how to hustle.
p47
aVI didn't do it as well, but we managed to get Youssou N'Dour, Sting,
p48
aVTracy Chapman, and Bruce Springsteen to go 'round the world for Amnesty,
p49
aVand it was an amazing experience.
p50
aVAnd, once again, I got an extraordinary education,
p51
aVand it was the first time, really,
p52
aVthat I'd met a lot of these people in the different countries,
p53
aVand these human rights stories became very physical,
p54
aVand, again, I couldn't really walk away quite so comfortably.
p55
aa(lp56
VBut the thing that really amazed me, that I had no idea,
p57
aVwas that you could suffer in this way
p58
aVand then have your whole experience, your story, denied,
p59
aVburied and forgotten.
p60
aVAnd it seemed that whenever there was a camera around,
p61
aVor a video or film camera,
p62
aVit was a great deal harder to do \u2014 for those in power to bury the story.
p63
aVAnd Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours
p64
aVand there was a decision then \u2014
p65
aVwell, we made a proposal, for a couple of years,
p66
aVabout trying to set up a division
p67
aVthat was going to give cameras to human rights activists.
p68
aVIt didn't really get anywhere,
p69
aVand then the Rodney King incident happened, and people thought,
p70
aVOK, if you have a camera in the right place at the right time,
p71
aVor, perhaps, the wrong time, depending who you are,
p72
aVthen you can actually start doing something,
p73
aVand campaigning, and being heard,
p74
aVand telling people about what's going on.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo, WITNESS was started in '92
p77
aVand it's since given cameras out in over 60 countries.
p78
aVAnd we campaign with activist groups
p79
aVand help them tell their story and, in fact,
p80
aVI will show you in a moment one of the most recent campaigns,
p81
aVand I'm afraid it's a story from Uganda,
p82
aVand, although we had a wonderful story from Uganda yesterday,
p83
aVthis one isn't quite so good.
p84
aVIn the north of Uganda,
p85
aVthere are something like 1.5 million internally displaced people,
p86
aVpeople who are not refugees in another country,
p87
aVbut because of the civil war, which has been going on for about 20 years,
p88
aVthey have nowhere to live.
p89
aVAnd 20,000 kids have been taken away to become child soldiers,
p90
aVand the International Criminal Court is going after five of the leaders of the \u2014
p91
aVnow, what's it called?
p92
aVI forget the name of the of the army \u2014
p93
aVit's Lord's Resistance Army, I believe \u2014
p94
aVbut the government, also, doesn't have a clean sheet,
p95
aVso if we could run the first video.
p96
aa(lp97

p98
aVWoman: Life in the camp is never simple. Even today life is difficult.
p99
aVWe stay because of the fear that what pushed us into the camp ...
p100
aVstill exists back home.
p101
aVText: "Between Two Fires: Torture and Displacement in Northern Uganda"
p102
aVMan: When we were at home, it was Kony's [rebel] soldiers disturbing us.
p103
aVAt first, we were safe in the camp.
p104
aVBut later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot.
p105
aa(lp106
V(Chanting)
p107
aVJennifer: A soldier walked onto the road, asking where we'd been.
p108
aVEvelyn and I hid behind my mother.
p109
aVEvelyn: He ordered us to sit down, so we sat down.
p110
aVThe other soldier also came.
p111
aVJennifer: The man came and started undressing me.
p112
aVThe other one carried Evelyn aside.
p113
aVThe one who was defiling me then left me and went to rape Evelyn.
p114
aVAnd the one who was raping Evelyn came and defiled me also.
p115
aVMan: The soldiers with clubs this long beat us to get a confession.
p116
aVThey kept telling us, "Tell the truth!" as they beat us.
p117
aVWoman: They insisted that I was lying.
p118
aVAt that moment, they fired and shot off my fingers.
p119
aVI fell. They ran to join the others ... leaving me for dead.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Music)
p122
aVText: Uganda ratified the Convention Against Torture in 1986.
p123
aVTorture is defined as any act by which severe pain of suffering,
p124
aVwhether physical or mental,
p125
aVis intentionally inflicted by a person acting in an official capacity
p126
aVto obtain information or a confession, to punish, coerce or intimidate.
p127
aa(lp128
VPeter Gabriel: So torture is not something that always happens on other soil.
p129
aVIn my country, it was \u2014
p130
aVwe had been looking at pictures of British soldiers beating up young Iraqis;
p131
aVwe've got Abu Ghraib; we've got Guantanamo Bay.
p132
aVI had a driver on my way to Newark Airport,
p133
aVand he told me a story that, in the middle of the night, 4 a.m.,
p134
aVhe'd been taken out of his home in Queens \u2014 taken to a place in the Midwest,
p135
aVthat he was interrogated and tortured
p136
aVand returned to the street four weeks later,
p137
aVbecause he had the same \u2014 he was Middle Eastern,
p138
aVand he had the same name as one of the 9/11 pilots,
p139
aVand that may or may not be true \u2014
p140
aVI didn't think he was a liar, though.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd, I think, if we look around the world,
p143
aVas well as the polar ice caps melting,
p144
aVhuman rights, which have been fought for,
p145
aVfor many hundreds of years in some cases,
p146
aVare, also, eroding very fast,
p147
aVand that is something that we need to take a look at
p148
aVand, maybe, start campaigning for.
p149
aVI mean, here, too, one of our partners was at Van Jones
p150
aVand the Books Not Bars project \u2014 they have managed,
p151
aVwith their footage in California
p152
aVto change the youth correction systems employed,
p153
aVand it's much \u2014 much \u2014 I think, more humane methods
p154
aVare being looked at, how you should lock up young kids,
p155
aVand that's questionable to start off.
p156
aVAnd as the story of Mr. Morales, just down the road,
p157
aVexcuse me, Mr. Gabriel,
p158
aVwould you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit?
p159
aVNo, not at all, no problem, take your time.
p160
aVBut this, surely, whoever that man is, whatever he's done,
p161
aVthis is cruel and unusual punishment.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnyway, WITNESS has been trying to arm the brave people
p164
aVwho often put their lives at risk around the world, with cameras,
p165
aVand I'd like to show you just a little more of that. Thank you.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Thunder) Text: You can say a story is fabricated.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Music)
p170
aVText: You can say a jury is corrupt.
p171
aVYou can say a person is lying.
p172
aVYou can say you don't trust newspapers.
p173
aVBut you can't say
p174
aVwhat you just saw
p175
aVnever happened.
p176
aVHelp WITNESS give cameras to the world.
p177
aVShoot a video;
p178
aVexpose injustice;
p179
aVreveal the truth;
p180
aVshow us what's wrong with the world;
p181
aVand maybe
p182
aVwe can help
p183
aVmake it
p184
aVright.
p185
aVWITNESS.
p186
aVAll the video you have just seen was recorded by
p187
aVhuman rights groups working with WITNESS.
p188

aa(lp191
VPG: WITNESS was born of technological innovation \u2014
p192
aVin a sense the small, portable, DV cam
p193
aVwas really what allowed it to come into being.
p194
aVAnd we've also been trying to get computers out to the world,
p195
aVso that groups can communicate much more effectively,
p196
aVcampaign much more effectively,
p197
aVbut now we have the wonderful possibility,
p198
aVwhich is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it,
p199
aVbecause that is cheap; it's ubiquitous; and it's moving fast
p200
aVall around the world \u2014 and it's very exciting for us.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd so, the dream is that we could have a world
p203
aVin which anyone who has anything bad happen to them of this sort
p204
aVhas a chance of getting their story uploaded,
p205
aVbeing seen, being watched,
p206
aVthat they really know that they can be heard,
p207
aVthat there would be a giant website,
p208
aVmaybe, a little like Google Earth,
p209
aVand you could fly over and find out the realities of what's going,
p210
aVfor the world's inhabitants. In a way
p211
aVwhat this technology is allowing is, really,
p212
aVthat a lot of the problems of the world can have a human face,
p213
aVthat we can actually see who's dying of AIDS
p214
aVor who's being beaten up, for the first time,
p215
aVand we can hear their stories in a way that the blogger culture \u2014
p216
aVif we can move that into these sort of fields,
p217
aVI think we can really transform the world in all sorts of ways.
p218
aVThere could be a new movement growing up,
p219
aVrising from the ground, reaching for the light,
p220
aVand growing strong, just like a tree. Thank you.
