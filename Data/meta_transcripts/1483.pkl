VGood evening.
p4
aa(lp5
VWe are in this wonderful
p6
aVopen-air amphitheater
p7
aVand we are enjoying ourselves
p8
aVin that mild evening
p9
aVtemperature tonight,
p10
aVbut when Qatar will host
p11
aVthe football World Cup
p12
aV10 years from now,
p13
aV2022,
p14
aVwe already heard it will be
p15
aVin the hot, very hot and sunny
p16
aVsummer months of June and July.
p17
aVAnd when Qatar has been assigned
p18
aVto the World Cup all, many
p19
aVpeople around the world have been
p20
aVwondering, how would it be
p21
aVpossible that football players
p22
aVshow spectacular football,
p23
aVrun around in this desert
p24
aVclimate? How would it be
p25
aVpossible that spectators sit,
p26
aVenjoy themselves in open-air
p27
aVstadia in this hot environment?
p28
aa(lp29
VTogether with the architects of
p30
aVAlbert Speer & Partner, our engineers
p31
aVfrom Transsolar have been
p32
aVsupporting, have been developing
p33
aVopen-air stadia based on 100 percent
p34
aVsolar power, on 100 percent solar cooling.
p35
aa(lp36
VLet me tell you about that,
p37
aVbut let me start with comfort.
p38
aVLet me start with the aspect
p39
aVof comfort, because many people
p40
aVare confusing
p41
aVambient temperature
p42
aVwith thermal comfort.
p43
aa(lp44
VWe are used to looking at charts like
p45
aVthat, and you see this red line
p46
aVshowing the air temperature
p47
aVin June and July, and yes, that's right,
p48
aVit's picking up to 45 degrees C.
p49
aVIt's actually very hot.
p50
aVBut air temperature is not
p51
aVthe full set of climatic
p52
aVparameters which define comfort.
p53
aa(lp54
VLet me show you analysis
p55
aVa colleague of mine did looking
p56
aVon different football, World Cups,
p57
aVOlympic Games around the world,
p58
aVlooking on the comfort
p59
aVand analyzing the comfort
p60
aVpeople have perceived at these
p61
aVdifferent sport activities,
p62
aVand let me start with Mexico.
p63
aa(lp64
VMexico temperature has been, air
p65
aVtemperature has been something between
p66
aV15, up to 30 degrees C, and people
p67
aVenjoyed themselves.
p68
aVIt was a very comfortable game
p69
aVin Mexico City. Have a look.
p70
aVOrlando, same kind of stadium,
p71
aVopen-air stadium. People have
p72
aVbeen sitting in the strong sun,
p73
aVin the very high humidity
p74
aVin the afternoon, and they
p75
aVdid not enjoy. It was not comfortable.
p76
aVThe air temperature was not too high, but it was not
p77
aVcomfortable during these games.
p78
aa(lp79
VWhat about Seoul? Seoul, because
p80
aVof broadcast rights, all the
p81
aVgames have been in the late
p82
aVafternoon. Sun has already been
p83
aVset, so the games have been
p84
aVperceived as comfortable.
p85
aa(lp86
VWhat about Athens? Mediterranean
p87
aVclimate, but in the sun it was
p88
aVnot comfortable. They didn't perceive comfort.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd we know that from Spain,
p91
aVwe know that "sol y sombra."
p92
aVIf you have a ticket, and you
p93
aVget a ticket for the shade,
p94
aVyou pay more, because you're
p95
aVin a more comfortable environment.
p96
aa(lp97
VWhat about Beijing?
p98
aVIt's again, sun in the day
p99
aVand high humidity,
p100
aVand it was not comfortable.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo if I overlay, and if you
p103
aVoverlay all these comfort
p104
aVenvelopes, what we see is,
p105
aVin all these places, air temperature has
p106
aVbeen ranging something from 25
p107
aVto 35, and if you go on
p108
aVthe line, 30, of 30 degrees C
p109
aVambient temperatures. If you
p110
aVgo along that line you see
p111
aVthere has been all kind of
p112
aVcomfort, all kinds of perceived
p113
aVoutdoor comfort, ranging from
p114
aVvery comfortable
p115
aVto very uncomfortable.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo why is that?
p118
aVThis is because there are
p119
aVmore parameters influencing
p120
aVour thermal comfort, which is
p121
aVthe sun, the direct sun,
p122
aVthe diffuse sun, which is wind,
p123
aVstrong wind, mild wind, which is
p124
aVair humidity, which is
p125
aVthe radiant temperature of the
p126
aVsurroundings where we are in.
p127
aVAnd this is air temperature.
p128
aa(lp129
VAll these parameters go into
p130
aVthe comfort feeling of our
p131
aVhuman body, and scientists
p132
aVhave developed a parameter,
p133
aVwhich is the perceived
p134
aVtemperature, where all these
p135
aVparameters go in and help
p136
aVdesigners to understand
p137
aVwhich is the driving parameter
p138
aVthat I feel comfort or that
p139
aVI don't feel comfort.
p140
aVWhich is the driving parameter
p141
aVwhich gives me a perceived
p142
aVtemperature? And these parameters,
p143
aVthese climatic parameters are
p144
aVrelated to the human metabolism.
p145
aa(lp146
VBecause of our metabolism,
p147
aVwe as human beings,
p148
aVwe produce heat.
p149
aVI'm excited, I'm talking to you,
p150
aVI'm probably producing
p151
aV150 watts
p152
aVat the moment. You are sitting,
p153
aVyou are relaxed, you're looking
p154
aVat me. It's probably 100
p155
aVwatts each person is producing,
p156
aVand we need to get rid of that
p157
aVenergy. I need, with my body,
p158
aVto get rid of the energy, and
p159
aVthe harder it is for myself,
p160
aVfor my body, to get rid of the
p161
aVenergy, the less comfort I feel.
p162
aVThat's it. And if I don't
p163
aVget rid of the energy,
p164
aVI will die.
p165
aa(lp166
VIf we overlay what happens
p167
aVduring the football World Cup,
p168
aVwhat will happen in June, July,
p169
aVwe will see, yes, air
p170
aVtemperature will be much higher,
p171
aVbut because the games and
p172
aVthe plays will be in the afternoon,
p173
aVit's probably the same comfort
p174
aVrating we've found in other
p175
aVplaces which has perceived
p176
aVas non-comfortable.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo we sat together with a team
p179
aVwhich prepared the Bid Book, or goal,
p180
aVthat we said, let's aim
p181
aVfor perceived temperature,
p182
aVfor outdoor comfort in this range,
p183
aVwhich is perceived with a
p184
aVtemperature of 32 degrees
p185
aVCelsius perceived temperature,
p186
aVwhich is extremely comfortable.
p187
aVPeople would feel really fine
p188
aVin an open outdoor environment.
p189
aa(lp190
VBut what does it mean?
p191
aVIf we just look on what happens,
p192
aVwe see, temperature's too high.
p193
aVIf we apply the best architectural design,
p194
aVclimate engineering design,
p195
aVwe won't get much better.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo we need to do something active.
p198
aVWe need, for instance, to bring
p199
aVin radiant cooling technology,
p200
aVand we need to combine this
p201
aVwith so-called soft conditioning.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd how does it look like in a stadium?
p204
aVSo the stadium has a few
p205
aVelements which create that
p206
aVoutdoor comfort. First of all,
p207
aVit's shading. It needs
p208
aVto protect where the people
p209
aVare sitting against strong
p210
aVand warm wind.
p211
aa(lp212
VBut that's not all what we need
p213
aVto do. We need to use
p214
aVactive systems.
p215
aVInstead of blowing a hurricane
p216
aVof chilled air through the stadium,
p217
aVwe can use radiant
p218
aVcooling technologies, like a
p219
aVfloor heating system where water
p220
aVpipes are embedded in the floor.
p221
aVAnd just by using cold water
p222
aVgoing through the water pipes,
p223
aVyou can release the heat
p224
aVwhich is absorbed during the day
p225
aVin the stadium, so you can
p226
aVcreate that comfort, and then by
p227
aVadding dry air instead of
p228
aVdown-chilled air, the spectators
p229
aVand the football players can
p230
aVadjust to their individual
p231
aVcomfort needs, to their
p232
aVindividual energy balance.
p233
aVThey can adjust and find
p234
aVtheir comfort they need to find.
p235
aa(lp236
VThere are 12 stadia probably
p237
aVto come, but there are
p238
aV32 training pitches where
p239
aVall the individual countries
p240
aVare going to train.
p241
aVWe applied the same concept:
p242
aVshading of the training pitch,
p243
aVusing a shelter against wind,
p244
aVthen using the grass.
p245
aVNatural-watered lawn is a
p246
aVvery good cooling source
p247
aVstabilizing temperature,
p248
aVand using dehumidified air to
p249
aVcreate comfort.
p250
aa(lp251
VBut even the best passive design
p252
aVwouldn't help.
p253
aVWe need active system.
p254
aVAnd how do we do that?
p255
aa(lp256
VOur idea for the bid was
p257
aV100 percent solar cooling,
p258
aVbased on the idea that we use
p259
aVthe roof of the stadia,
p260
aVwe cover the roofs of the stadia
p261
aVwith PV systems.
p262
aVWe don't borrow any energy
p263
aVfrom history.
p264
aVWe are not using fossil energies.
p265
aVWe are not borrowing energy
p266
aVfrom our neighbors.
p267
aVWe're using energy we can harvest
p268
aVon our roofs, and also on the
p269
aVtraining pitches, which will be
p270
aVcovered with large, flexible
p271
aVmembranes, and we will see
p272
aVin the next years an industry
p273
aVcoming up with flexible
p274
aVphotovoltaics, giving
p275
aVthe possibilities of shading
p276
aVagainst strong sun and producing
p277
aVelectric energy in the same time.
p278
aa(lp279
VAnd this energy now is
p280
aVharvested throughout the year,
p281
aVsent into the grid,
p282
aVis replacing fossils
p283
aVin the grid, and when I need it
p284
aVfor the cooling, I take it
p285
aVback from the grid and I
p286
aVuse the solar energy
p287
aVwhich I have brought to the grid
p288
aVback when I need
p289
aVit for the solar cooling.
p290
aVAnd I can do that in the first
p291
aVyear and I can balance that
p292
aVin the next 10, and the next
p293
aV20 years, this energy,
p294
aVwhich is necessary to condition
p295
aVa World Cup in Qatar,
p296
aVthe next 20 years, this energy
p297
aVgoes into the grid of Qatar.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo this \u2014 (Applause)
p300
aa(lp301
VThank you very much. (Applause)
p302
aa(lp303
VThis is not only useful
p304
aVfor stadia. We can use that also
p305
aVin open-air places and streets,
p306
aVand we've been working on
p307
aVthe City of the Future
p308
aVin Masdar, which is in the
p309
aVUnited Emirates, Abu Dhabi.
p310
aVAnd I had the pleasure to work
p311
aVon the central plaza.
p312
aVAnd the same idea to use there,
p313
aVto create outdoor conditions
p314
aVwhich are perceived
p315
aVas comfortable. People enjoy
p316
aVgoing there instead of going
p317
aVinto a shopping mall, which is
p318
aVchilled down and which is
p319
aVcooled. We wanted to create
p320
aVan outdoor space
p321
aVwhich is so comfortable that
p322
aVpeople can go there in the
p323
aVearly afternoon, even in these
p324
aVsunny and hot summer months,
p325
aVand they can enjoy and meet there
p326
aVwith their families. (Applause)
p327
aa(lp328
VAnd the same concept:
p329
aVshade against the sun,
p330
aVshade against the wind,
p331
aVand use, use and take advantage
p332
aVof the sun you can harvest
p333
aVon your footprint.
p334
aVAnd these beautiful umbrellas.
p335
aa(lp336
VSo I'd like to encourage you
p337
aVto pay attention to your
p338
aVthermal comfort, to your
p339
aVthermal environment,
p340
aVtonight and tomorrow,
p341
aVand if you'd like to learn more
p342
aVabout that, I invite you
p343
aVto go to our website.
p344
aVWe uploaded a very simple
p345
aVperceived temperature calculator
p346
aVwhere you can check out
p347
aVabout your outdoor comfort.
p348
aVAnd I also hope that you
p349
aVshare the idea that
p350
aVif engineers and designers
p351
aVcan use all these different
p352
aVclimatic parameters,
p353
aVit will be possible to create
p354
aVreally good and comfortable
p355
aVoutdoor conditions,
p356
aVto change our thermal perception
p357
aVthat we feel comfortable
p358
aVin an outdoor environment,
p359
aVand we can do that
p360
aVwith the best passive design,
p361
aVbut also using the energy source
p362
aVof the site in Qatar which is
p363
aVthe sun.
p364
