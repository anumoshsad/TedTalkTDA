VSo what does the happiest man in the world look like?
p4
aVHe certainly doesn't look like me.
p5
aVHe looks like this.
p6
aVHis name is Matthieu Ricard.
p7
aVSo how do you get to be the happiest man in the world?
p8
aVWell it turns out
p9
aVthere is a way to measure happiness in the brain.
p10
aVAnd you do that by measuring the relative activation
p11
aVof the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI,
p12
aVversus the right prefrontal cortex.
p13
aVAnd Matthieu's happiness measure
p14
aVis off the charts.
p15
aVHe's by far the happiest man
p16
aVever measured by science.
p17
aVWhich leads us to a question:
p18
aVWhat was he thinking when he was being measured?
p19
aVPerhaps something very naughty.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aVActually, he was meditating
p22
aVon compassion.
p23
aVMatthieu's own experience
p24
aVis that compassion is the happiest state ever.
p25
aa(lp26
VReading about Matthieu
p27
aVwas one of the pivotal moments of my life.
p28
aVMy dream
p29
aVis to create the conditions
p30
aVfor world peace in my lifetime \u2014
p31
aVand to do that
p32
aVby creating the conditions
p33
aVfor inner peace
p34
aVand compassion
p35
aVon a global scale.
p36
aVAnd learning about Matthieu
p37
aVgave me a new angle to look at my work.
p38
aVMatthieu's brain scan shows
p39
aVthat compassion is not a chore.
p40
aVCompassion is something that creates happiness.
p41
aVCompassion is fun.
p42
aVAnd that mind-blowing insight
p43
aVchanges the entire game.
p44
aVBecause if compassion was a chore,
p45
aVnobody's going to do it,
p46
aVexcept maybe the Dalai Lama or something.
p47
aVBut if compassion was fun,
p48
aVeverybody's going to do it.
p49
aVTherefore,
p50
aVto create the conditions for global compassion,
p51
aVall we have to do
p52
aVis to reframe compassion
p53
aVas something that is fun.
p54
aa(lp55
VBut fun is not enough.
p56
aVWhat if compassion
p57
aVis also profitable?
p58
aVWhat if compassion is also good for business?
p59
aVThen, every boss, every manager in the world,
p60
aVwill want to have compassion \u2014
p61
aVlike this.
p62
aVThat would create the conditions
p63
aVfor world peace.
p64
aVSo, I started paying attention
p65
aVto what compassion looks like in a business setting.
p66
aVFortunately, I didn't have to look very far.
p67
aVBecause what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes \u2014
p68
aVin Google, my company.
p69
aa(lp70
VI know there are other compassionate companies in the world,
p71
aVbut Google is the place I'm familiar with
p72
aVbecause I've been there for 10 years,
p73
aVso I'll use Google as the case study.
p74
aVGoogle is a company
p75
aVborn of idealism.
p76
aVIt's a company that thrives on idealism.
p77
aVAnd maybe because of that,
p78
aVcompassion is organic
p79
aVand widespread company-wide.
p80
aVIn Google, expressions of corporate compassion
p81
aValmost always follow the same pattern.
p82
aVIt's sort of a funny pattern.
p83
aVIt starts with a small group of Googlers
p84
aVtaking the initiative to do something.
p85
aVAnd they don't usually ask for permission;
p86
aVthey just go ahead and do it,
p87
aVand then other Googlers join in, and it just gets bigger and bigger.
p88
aVAnd sometimes it gets big enough
p89
aVto become official.
p90
aVSo in other words,
p91
aVit almost always starts from the bottom up.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd let me give you some examples.
p94
aVThe first example is the largest annual community event \u2014
p95
aVwhere Googlers from around the world
p96
aVdonate their labor to their local communities \u2014
p97
aVwas initiated and organized
p98
aVby three employees
p99
aVbefore it became official,
p100
aVbecause it just became too big.
p101
aVAnother example, three Googlers \u2014
p102
aVa chef, an engineer
p103
aVand, most funny, a massage therapist \u2014
p104
aVthree of them, they learned about a region in India
p105
aVwhere 200,000 people live
p106
aVwithout a single medical facility.
p107
aVSo what do they do?
p108
aVThey just go ahead and start a fundraiser.
p109
aVAnd they raise enough money to build this hospital \u2014
p110
aVthe first hospital of its kind
p111
aVfor 200,000 people.
p112
aVDuring the Haiti earthquake,
p113
aVa number of engineers and product managers
p114
aVspontaneously came together
p115
aVand stayed overnight
p116
aVto build a tool
p117
aVto allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones.
p118
aVAnd expressions of compassion
p119
aVare also found in our international offices.
p120
aa(lp121
VIn China for example,
p122
aVone mid-level employee
p123
aVinitiated the largest social action competition in China,
p124
aVinvolving more than 1,000 schools in China,
p125
aVworking on issues
p126
aVsuch as education, poverty,
p127
aVhealth care and the environment.
p128
aVThere is so much organic social action
p129
aVall around Google
p130
aVthat the company decided to form
p131
aVa social responsibility team
p132
aVjust to support these efforts.
p133
aVAnd this idea, again,
p134
aVcame from the grassroots,
p135
aVfrom two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions
p136
aVand volunteered themselves for the job.
p137
aVAnd I found it fascinating
p138
aVthat the social responsibility team
p139
aVwas not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy.
p140
aVIt was two persons saying, "Let's do this,"
p141
aVand the company said, "Yes."
p142
aVSo it turns out
p143
aVthat Google is a compassionate company,
p144
aVbecause Googlers found
p145
aVcompassion to be fun.
p146
aa(lp147
VBut again, fun is not enough.
p148
aVThere are also real business benefits.
p149
aVSo what are they?
p150
aVThe first benefit of compassion
p151
aVis that it creates highly effective business leaders.
p152
aVWhat does that mean?
p153
aVThere are three components of compassion.
p154
aVThere is the affective component,
p155
aVwhich is, "I feel for you."
p156
aVThere is the cognitive component,
p157
aVwhich is, "I understand you."
p158
aVAnd there is a motivational component,
p159
aVwhich is, "I want to help you."
p160
aVSo what has this got to do with business leadership?
p161
aVAccording to a very comprehensive study
p162
aVled by Jim Collins,
p163
aVand documented in the book "Good to Great,"
p164
aVit takes a very special kind of leader
p165
aVto bring a company
p166
aVfrom goodness to greatness.
p167
aVAnd he calls them "Level 5 leaders."
p168
aVThese are leaders
p169
aVwho, in addition to being highly capable,
p170
aVpossess two important qualities,
p171
aVand they are
p172
aVhumility and ambition.
p173
aVThese are leaders
p174
aVwho are highly ambitious for the greater good.
p175
aVAnd because they're ambitious for a greater good,
p176
aVthey feel no need to inflate their own egos.
p177
aVAnd they, according to the research,
p178
aVmake the best business leaders.
p179
aVAnd if you look at these qualities
p180
aVin the context of compassion,
p181
aVwe find
p182
aVthat the cognitive and affective components of compassion \u2014
p183
aVunderstanding people and empathizing with people \u2014
p184
aVinhibits, tones down,
p185
aVwhat I call the excessive self-obsession that's in us,
p186
aVtherefore creating the conditions
p187
aVfor humility.
p188
aa(lp189
VThe motivational component of compassion
p190
aVcreates ambition for greater good.
p191
aVIn other words,
p192
aVcompassion is the way to grow Level 5 leaders.
p193
aVAnd this is the first compelling business benefit.
p194
aVThe second compelling benefit of compassion
p195
aVis that it creates an inspiring workforce.
p196
aVEmployees mutually inspire each other
p197
aVtowards greater good.
p198
aVIt creates a vibrant, energetic community
p199
aVwhere people admire and respect each other.
p200
aVI mean, you come to work in the morning,
p201
aVand you work with three guys
p202
aVwho just up and decide to build a hospital in India.
p203
aVIt's like how can you not be inspired by those people \u2014
p204
aVyour own coworkers?
p205
aVSo this mutual inspiration
p206
aVpromotes collaboration,
p207
aVinitiative and creativity.
p208
aVIt makes us a highly effective company.
p209
aa(lp210
VSo, having said all that,
p211
aVwhat is the secret formula
p212
aVfor brewing compassion
p213
aVin the corporate setting?
p214
aVIn our experience,
p215
aVthere are three ingredients.
p216
aVThe first ingredient
p217
aVis to create a culture
p218
aVof passionate concern
p219
aVfor the greater good.
p220
aVSo always think:
p221
aVhow is your company and your job
p222
aVserving the greater good?
p223
aVOr, how can you further serve
p224
aVthe greater good?
p225
aVThis awareness of serving the greater good
p226
aVis very self-inspiring
p227
aVand it creates fertile ground
p228
aVfor compassion to grow in.
p229
aVThat's one.
p230
aa(lp231
VThe second ingredient
p232
aVis autonomy.
p233
aVSo in Google, there's a lot of autonomy.
p234
aVAnd one of our most popular managers jokes that,
p235
aVthis is what he says,
p236
aV"Google is a place
p237
aVwhere the inmates run the asylum."
p238
aVAnd he considers himself one of the inmates.
p239
aVIf you already have
p240
aVa culture of compassion
p241
aVand idealism
p242
aVand you let your people roam free,
p243
aVthey will do the right thing
p244
aVin the most compassionate way.
p245
aa(lp246
VThe third ingredient
p247
aVis to focus on inner development
p248
aVand personal growth.
p249
aVLeadership training in Google, for example,
p250
aVplaces a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities,
p251
aVsuch as self-awareness, self-mastery,
p252
aVempathy and compassion,
p253
aVbecause we believe
p254
aVthat leadership begins
p255
aVwith character.
p256
aVWe even created a seven-week curriculum
p257
aVon emotion intelligence,
p258
aVwhich we jokingly call "Searching Inside Yourself."
p259
aVIt's less naughty than it sounds.
p260
aVSo I'm an engineer by training,
p261
aVbut I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course,
p262
aVwhich I find kind of funny,
p263
aVbecause this is a company that trusts an engineer
p264
aVto teach emotion intelligence.
p265
aVWhat a company.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Laughter)
p268
aa(lp269
VSo "Search Inside Yourself" \u2014 how does it work?
p270
aVIt works in three steps.
p271
aVThe first step
p272
aVis attention training.
p273
aVAttention is the basis
p274
aVof all higher cognitive and emotional abilities.
p275
aVTherefore, any curriculum
p276
aVfor training emotion intelligence
p277
aVhas to begin with attention training.
p278
aVThe idea here is to train attention
p279
aVto create a quality of mind
p280
aVthat is calm and clear
p281
aVat the same time.
p282
aVAnd this creates the foundation
p283
aVfor emotion intelligence.
p284
aVThe second step follows the first step.
p285
aa(lp286
VThe second step is developing self-knowledge
p287
aVand self-mastery.
p288
aVSo using the supercharged attention from step one,
p289
aVwe create a high-resolution perception
p290
aVinto the cognitive and emotive processes.
p291
aVWhat does that mean?
p292
aVIt means being able to observe our thought stream
p293
aVand the process of emotion
p294
aVwith high clarity,
p295
aVobjectivity
p296
aVand from a third-person perspective.
p297
aVAnd once you can do that,
p298
aVyou create the kind of self-knowledge
p299
aVthat enables self-mastery.
p300
aa(lp301
VThe third step, following the second step,
p302
aVis to create new mental habits.
p303
aVWhat does that mean? Imagine this.
p304
aVImagine whenever you meet any other person,
p305
aVany time you meet a person,
p306
aVyour habitual, instinctive first thought
p307
aVis, "I want you to be happy.
p308
aVI want you to be happy."
p309
aVImagine you can do that.
p310
aVHaving this habit, this mental habit,
p311
aVchanges everything at work.
p312
aVBecause this good will
p313
aVis unconsciously picked up by other people,
p314
aVand it creates trust,
p315
aVand trust creates a lot of good working relationships.
p316
aVAnd this also creates the conditions
p317
aVfor compassion in the workplace.
p318
aVSomeday, we hope to open-source
p319
aV"Search Inside Yourself"
p320
aVso that everybody in the corporate world
p321
aVwill at least be able to use it as a reference.
p322
aa(lp323
VAnd in closing,
p324
aVI want to end the same place I started,
p325
aVwith happiness.
p326
aVI want to quote this guy \u2014 the guy in robes, not the other guy \u2014
p327
aVthe Dalai Lama,
p328
aVwho said, "If you want others to be happy,
p329
aVpractice compassion.
p330
aVIf you want to be happy,
p331
aVpractice compassion."
p332
aVI found this to be true,
p333
aVboth on the individual level
p334
aVand at a corporate level.
p335
aVAnd I hope that compassion
p336
aVwill be both fun and profitable for you too.
p337
aa(lp338
VThank you.
