VYour company launches a search for an open position.
p4
aVThe applications start rolling in,
p5
aVand the qualified candidates are identified.
p6
aVNow the choosing begins.
p7
aVPerson A: Ivy League, 4.0, flawless resume,
p8
aVgreat recommendations.
p9
aVAll the right stuff.
p10
aVPerson B: state school, fair amount of job hopping,
p11
aVand odd jobs like cashier and singing waitress.
p12
aVBut remember \u2014 both are qualified.
p13
aVSo I ask you:
p14
aVwho are you going to pick?
p15
aa(lp16
VMy colleagues and I created very official terms
p17
aVto describe two distinct categories of candidates.
p18
aVWe call A "the Silver Spoon,"
p19
aVthe one who clearly had advantages and was destined for success.
p20
aVAnd we call B "the Scrapper,"
p21
aVthe one who had to fight against tremendous odds
p22
aVto get to the same point.
p23
aVYou just heard a human resources director refer to people
p24
aVas Silver Spoons and Scrappers \u2014
p25
aa(lp26
V(Laughter)
p27
aa(lp28
Vwhich is not exactly politically correct and sounds a bit judgmental.
p29
aVBut before my human resources certification gets revoked \u2014
p30
aa(lp31
V(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
Vlet me explain.
p34
aa(lp35
VA resume tells a story.
p36
aVAnd over the years, I've learned something about people
p37
aVwhose experiences read like a patchwork quilt,
p38
aVthat makes me stop and fully consider them
p39
aVbefore tossing their resumes away.
p40
aVA series of odd jobs may indicate
p41
aVinconsistency, lack of focus, unpredictability.
p42
aVOr it may signal a committed struggle against obstacles.
p43
aVAt the very least, the Scrapper deserves an interview.
p44
aa(lp45
VTo be clear,
p46
aVI don't hold anything against the Silver Spoon;
p47
aVgetting into and graduating from an elite university
p48
aVtakes a lot of hard work and sacrifice.
p49
aVBut if your whole life has been engineered toward success,
p50
aVhow will you handle the tough times?
p51
aVOne person I hired felt that because he attended an elite university,
p52
aVthere were certain assignments that were beneath him,
p53
aVlike temporarily doing manual labor to better understand an operation.
p54
aVEventually, he quit.
p55
aVBut on the flip side,
p56
aVwhat happens when your whole life is destined for failure
p57
aVand you actually succeed?
p58
aa(lp59
VI want to urge you to interview the Scrapper.
p60
aVI know a lot about this because I am a Scrapper.
p61
aVBefore I was born,
p62
aVmy father was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia,
p63
aVand he couldn't hold a job in spite of his brilliance.
p64
aVOur lives were one part "Cuckoo's Nest,"
p65
aVone part "Awakenings"
p66
aVand one part "A Beautiful Mind."
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VI'm the fourth of five children raised by a single mother
p71
aVin a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York.
p72
aVWe never owned a home, a car, a washing machine,
p73
aVand for most of my childhood, we didn't even have a telephone.
p74
aVSo I was highly motivated
p75
aVto understand the relationship between business success and Scrappers,
p76
aVbecause my life could easily have turned out very differently.
p77
aVAs I met successful business people
p78
aVand read profiles of high-powered leaders,
p79
aVI noticed some commonality.
p80
aa(lp81
VMany of them had experienced early hardships,
p82
aVanywhere from poverty, abandonment,
p83
aVdeath of a parent while young,
p84
aVto learning disabilities, alcoholism and violence.
p85
aVThe conventional thinking has been that trauma leads to distress,
p86
aVand there's been a lot of focus on the resulting dysfunction.
p87
aVBut during studies of dysfunction, data revealed an unexpected insight:
p88
aVthat even the worst circumstances can result in growth and transformation.
p89
aVA remarkable and counterintuitive phenomenon has been discovered,
p90
aVwhich scientists call Post Traumatic Growth.
p91
aa(lp92
VIn one study designed to measure the effects of adversity
p93
aVon children at risk,
p94
aVamong a subset of 698 children
p95
aVwho experienced the most severe and extreme conditions,
p96
aVfully one-third grew up to lead healthy, successful and productive lives.
p97
aVIn spite of everything and against tremendous odds, they succeeded.
p98
aVOne-third.
p99
aa(lp100
VTake this resume.
p101
aVThis guy's parents give him up for adoption.
p102
aVHe never finishes college.
p103
aVHe job-hops quite a bit,
p104
aVgoes on a sojourn to India for a year,
p105
aVand to top it off, he has dyslexia.
p106
aVWould you hire this guy?
p107
aVHis name is Steve Jobs.
p108
aa(lp109
VIn a study of the world's most highly successful entrepreneurs,
p110
aVit turns out a disproportionate number have dyslexia.
p111
aVIn the US,
p112
aV35 percent of the entrepreneurs studied had dyslexia.
p113
aVWhat's remarkable \u2014 among those entrepreneurs
p114
aVwho experience post traumatic growth,
p115
aVthey now view their learning disability
p116
aVas a desirable difficulty which provided them an advantage
p117
aVbecause they became better listeners and paid greater attention to detail.
p118
aVThey don't think they are who they are in spite of adversity,
p119
aVthey know they are who they are because of adversity.
p120
aVThey embrace their trauma and hardships
p121
aVas key elements of who they've become,
p122
aVand know that without those experiences,
p123
aVthey might not have developed the muscle and grit required
p124
aVto become successful.
p125
aa(lp126
VOne of my colleagues had his life completely upended
p127
aVas a result of the Chinese Cultural Revolution in 1966.
p128
aVAt age 13, his parents were relocated to the countryside,
p129
aVthe schools were closed
p130
aVand he was left alone in Beijing to fend for himself until 16,
p131
aVwhen he got a job in a clothing factory.
p132
aVBut instead of accepting his fate,
p133
aVhe made a resolution that he would continue his formal education.
p134
aVEleven years later, when the political landscape changed,
p135
aVhe heard about a highly selective university admissions test.
p136
aVHe had three months to learn the entire curriculum
p137
aVof middle and high school.
p138
aVSo, every day he came home from the factory,
p139
aVtook a nap, studied until 4am, went back to work
p140
aVand repeated this cycle every day for three months.
p141
aVHe did it, he succeeded.
p142
aVHis commitment to his education was unwavering, and he never lost hope.
p143
aVToday, he holds a master's degree,
p144
aVand his daughters each have degrees from Cornell and Harvard.
p145
aa(lp146
VScrappers are propelled by the belief
p147
aVthat the only person you have full control over is yourself.
p148
aVWhen things don't turn out well,
p149
aVScrappers ask, "What can I do differently to create a better result?"
p150
aVScrappers have a sense of purpose
p151
aVthat prevents them from giving up on themselves,
p152
aVkind of like if you've survived poverty, a crazy father and several muggings,
p153
aVyou figure, "Business challenges? \u2014
p154
aa(lp155
V(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VReally?
p158
aVPiece of cake. I got this."
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd that reminds me \u2014 humor.
p163
aVScrappers know that humor gets you through the tough times,
p164
aVand laughter helps you change your perspective.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd finally, there are relationships.
p167
aVPeople who overcome adversity don't do it alone.
p168
aVSomewhere along the way,
p169
aVthey find people who bring out the best in them
p170
aVand who are invested in their success.
p171
aVHaving someone you can count on no matter what
p172
aVis essential to overcoming adversity.
p173
aVI was lucky.
p174
aVIn my first job after college,
p175
aVI didn't have a car, so I carpooled across two bridges
p176
aVwith a woman who was the president's assistant.
p177
aVShe watched me work
p178
aVand encouraged me to focus on my future
p179
aVand not dwell on my past.
p180
aVAlong the way I've met many people
p181
aVwho've provided me brutally honest feedback,
p182
aVadvice and mentorship.
p183
aVThese people don't mind
p184
aVthat I once worked as a singing waitress to help pay for college.
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VI'll leave you with one final, valuable insight.
p189
aVCompanies that are committed to diversity and inclusive practices
p190
aVtend to support Scrappers
p191
aVand outperform their peers.
p192
aVAccording to DiversityInc,
p193
aVa study of their top 50 companies for diversity
p194
aVoutperformed the S&P 500 by 25 percent.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo back to my original question.
p197
aVWho are you going to bet on:
p198
aVSilver Spoon or Scrapper?
p199
aVI say choose the underestimated contender,
p200
aVwhose secret weapons are passion and purpose.
p201
aa(lp202
VHire the Scrapper.
