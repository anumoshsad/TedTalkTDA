VAbout 15 years ago, I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong.
p4
aVAnd at the time I was very superstitious.
p5
aVSo, upon landing \u2014 this was still at the old Hong Kong airport
p6
aVthat's Kai Tak, when it was smack in the middle of the city \u2014
p7
aVI thought, "If I see something good, I'm going to have a great time here in
p8
aVmy two weeks. And if I see something negative, I'm going to be miserable, indeed."
p9
aa(lp10
VSo the plane landed in between the buildings
p11
aVand got to a full stop in front of this little billboard.
p12
aV(Laughter)
p13
aVAnd I actually went to see some of the design companies
p14
aVin Hong Kong in my stay there.
p15
aVAnd it turned out that \u2014
p16
aVI just went to see, you know, what they are doing in Hong Kong.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut I actually walked away with a great job offer.
p19
aVAnd I flew back to Austria, packed my bags,
p20
aVand, another week later, I was again on my way to Hong Kong
p21
aVstill superstitions and thinking, "Well, if that 'Winner' billboard is still up,
p22
aVI'm going to have a good time working here.
p23
aV(Laughter)
p24
aVBut if it's gone, it's going to be really miserable and stressful."
p25
aVSo it turned out that not only was the billboard still up
p26
aVbut they had put this one right next to it.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aVOn the other hand, it also taught me where superstition gets me
p29
aVbecause I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VHowever, I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life \u2014
p33
aVof, you know, I think what the conference brochure refers to
p34
aVas "moments that take your breath away."
p35
aVAnd since I'm a big list maker, I actually listed them all.
p36
aV(Laughter)
p37
aVNow, you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them
p38
aVand I won't read them for you.
p39
aVI know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people's happinesses.
p40
aV(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VWhat I did do, though is, I actually looked at them from a design standpoint
p43
aVand just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design.
p44
aVAnd, very surprisingly, over half of them had, actually, something to do with design.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo there are, of course, two different possibilities.
p47
aVThere's one from a consumer's point of view \u2014
p48
aVwhere I was happy while experiencing design.
p49
aVAnd I'll just give you one example. I had gotten my first Walkman.
p50
aVThis is 1983.
p51
aVMy brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle
p52
aVthat he was willing to borrow to me freely.
p53
aVAnd The Police's "Synchronicity"
p54
aVcassette had just been released
p55
aVand there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz.
p56
aVSo you could drive up into the mountains
p57
aVfreely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman.
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aVAnd I remember it as a true moment of happiness.
p60
aVYou know, of course, they are related to this combination of
p61
aVat least two of them being, you know, design objects.
p62
aVAnd, you know, there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design
p63
aVbut the motorcycle incident would definitely be, you know,
p64
aVsituated somewhere here \u2014 right in there between Delight and Bliss.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, there is the other part, from a designer's standpoint \u2014
p67
aVif you're happy while actually doing it.
p68
aVAnd one way to see how happy designers are when they're designing could be to
p69
aVlook at the authors' photos on the back of their monographs?
p70
aV(Laughter)
p71
aVSo, according to this, the Australians and the Japanese
p72
aVas well as the Mexicans
p73
aVare very happy.
p74
aV(Laughter)
p75
aVWhile, somewhat, the Spaniards ...
p76
aVand, I think, particularly, the Swiss
p77
aV(Laughter),
p78
aVdon't seem to be doing all that well.
p79
aV(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VLast November, a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum,
p82
aVin a skyscraper, up on the 56th floor.
p83
aVAnd their inaugural exhibit was called "Happiness."
p84
aVAnd I went, very eagerly, to see it, because \u2014
p85
aVwell, also, with an eye on this conference.
p86
aVAnd they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas.
p87
aVUnder "Arcadia," they showed things like this, from the Edo period \u2014
p88
aVa hundred ways to write "happiness" in different forms.
p89
aVOr they had this apple by Yoko Ono \u2014 that, of course, later on
p90
aVwas, you know, made into the label for The Beatles.
p91
aa(lp92
VUnder "Nirvana" they showed this Constable painting.
p93
aVAnd there was a little \u2014 an interesting theory about abstraction.
p94
aVThis is a blue field \u2014 it's actually an Yves Klein painting.
p95
aVAnd the theory was that if you abstract an image, you really, you know
p96
aVopen as much room for the un-representable \u2014
p97
aVand, therefore, you know, are able to involve the viewer more.
p98
aa(lp99
VThen, under "Desire," they showed these Shunsho paintings \u2014
p100
aValso from the Edo period \u2014 ink on silk.
p101
aVAnd, lastly, under "Harmony," they had this 13th-century mandala from Tibet.
p102
aa(lp103
VNow, what I took away from the exhibit was that
p104
aVmaybe with the exception of the mandala
p105
aVmost of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness
p106
aVand not about happiness.
p107
aVAnd I felt a little bit cheated, because the visualization \u2014
p108
aVthat's a really easy thing to do.
p109
aVAnd, you know, my studio \u2014 we've done it all the time.
p110
aVThis is, you know, a book.
p111
aVA happy dog \u2014 and you take it out, it's an aggressive dog.
p112
aVIt's a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne.
p113
aVOr a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face.
p114
aVYou know, that's not a big deal to accomplish.
p115
aa(lp116
VIt has gotten to the point where, you know, within advertising
p117
aVor within the movie industry, "happy" has gotten such a bad reputation that
p118
aVif you actually want to do something with the subject
p119
aVand still appear authentic, you almost would have to, you know,
p120
aVdo it from a cynical point of view.
p121
aVThis is, you know, the movie poster.
p122
aVOr we, a couple of weeks ago, designed a box set for The Talking Heads
p123
aVwhere the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has, very much, a dark side to it.
p124
aa(lp125
VMuch, much more difficult is this, where the designs actually can evoke happiness \u2014
p126
aVand I'm going to just show you three that actually did this for me.
p127
aVThis is a campaign done by a young artist in New York, who calls himself "True."
p128
aVEverybody who has ridden the New York subway system will be
p129
aVfamiliar with these signs?
p130
aVTrue printed his own version of these signs.
p131
aVMet every Wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends.
p132
aVThey divided up the different subway lines and added their own version.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVSo this is one.
p135
aV(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VNow, the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs.
p138
aVSo you're
p139
aV(Laughter)
p140
aVyou're really bored in the subway, and you kind of stare at something.
p141
aVAnd it takes you a while until it actually \u2014
p142
aVyou realize that this says something different than what it normally says.
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aVI mean, that's, at least, how it made me happy.
p145
aV(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VNow, True is a real humanitarian.
p148
aVHe didn't want any of his friends to be arrested,
p149
aVso he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card.
p150
aV(Laughter)
p151
aVAnd also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody \u2014
p152
aVsort of like pretending that it's an art project
p153
aVfinanced by The Metropolitan Transit Authority.
p154
aV(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VAnother New York project.
p157
aVThis is at P.S. 1 \u2014 a sculpture that's basically a square room
p158
aVby James Turrell, that has a retractable ceiling.
p159
aVOpens up at dusk and dawn every day.
p160
aVYou don't see the horizon.
p161
aVYou're just in there, watching the incredible, subtle changes of color in the sky.
p162
aVAnd the room is truly something to be seen.
p163
aVPeople's demeanor changes when they go in there.
p164
aVAnd, for sure, I haven't looked at the sky in the same way
p165
aVafter spending an hour in there.
p166
aa(lp167
VThere are, of course, more than those three projects that I'm showing here.
p168
aVI would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz' "Cloud"
p169
aVa couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy, as well.
p170
aVBut my last project is, again, from a young designer in New York.
p171
aVHe's from Korea originally.
p172
aVAnd he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles \u2014
p173
aVempty speech bubbles stickers, large ones and small ones.
p174
aVAnd he goes around New York and just puts them, empty as they are, on posters.
p175
aV(Laughter)
p176
aVAnd other people go and fill them in.
p177
aV(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VThis one says, "Please let me die in peace."
p180
aV(Laughter)
p181
aVI think that was \u2014
p182
aVthe most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good.
p183
aVThis is on a musician poster, that says:
p184
aV"I am concerned that my CD will not sell more than 200,000 units
p185
aVand that, as a result, my recoupable advance
p186
aVfrom my label will be taken from me,
p187
aVafter which, my contract will be cancelled,
p188
aVand I'll be back doing Journey covers on Bleecker Street."
p189
aV(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VI think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins.
p192
aVJee gets to have his project;
p193
aVthe public gets a sweeter environment;
p194
aVand different public gets a place to express itself;
p195
aVand the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads.
p196
aV(Laughter)
p197
aa(lp198
VWell, there was a question, of course, that was on my mind for a while:
p199
aVYou know, can I do more of the things that I like doing in design
p200
aVand less of the ones that I don't like to be doing?
p201
aVWhich brought me back to my list making \u2014
p202
aVyou know, just to see what I actually like about my job.
p203
aa(lp204
VYou know, one is: just working without pressure.
p205
aVThen: working concentrated, without being frazzled.
p206
aVOr, as Nancy said before, like really immerse oneself into it.
p207
aVTry not to get stuck doing the same thing \u2014
p208
aVor try not get stuck behind the computer all day.
p209
aVThis is, you know, related to it: getting out of the studio.
p210
aVThen, of course, trying to, you know, work on things
p211
aVwhere the content is actually important for me.
p212
aVAnd being able to enjoy the end results.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd then I found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained
p215
aVall the things that I thought I learned in my life so far.
p216
aVAnd, just about at that time, an Austrian magazine called and asked
p217
aVif we would want to do six spreads \u2014 design six spreads
p218
aVthat work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine?
p219
aVAnd the whole thing just fell together.
p220
aVSo I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned \u2014
p221
aVin this case, "Everything I do always comes back to me" \u2014
p222
aVand we made these spreads right out of this.
p223
aVSo it was: "Everything
p224
aVI do
p225
aValways
p226
aVcomes
p227
aVback
p228
aVto me."
p229
aa(lp230
VA couple of weeks ago, a
p231
aV(Laughter)
p232
aVFrench company asked us to design five billboards for them.
p233
aVAgain, we could supply the content for it.
p234
aVSo I just picked another one.
p235
aVAnd this was two weeks ago.
p236
aVWe flew to Arizona \u2014 the designer who works with me, and myself \u2014
p237
aVand photographed this one.
p238
aVSo it's: "Trying
p239
aVto look
p240
aVgood
p241
aVlimits
p242
aVmy life."
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd then we did one more of these.
p245
aVThis is, again, for a magazine, dividing pages.
p246
aVThis is: "Having" \u2014
p247
aVthis is the same thing;
p248
aVit's just, you know, photographed from the side.
p249
aVThis is from the front.
p250
aVThen it's: "guts."
p251
aVAgain, it's the same thing \u2014 "guts" is just the same room, reworked.
p252
aVThen it's: "always
p253
aVworks out."
p254
aVThen it's "for," with the light on.
p255
aV(Laughter)
p256
aVAnd it's "me."
p257
aa(lp258
VThank you so much.
