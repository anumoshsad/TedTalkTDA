VI'm going to be showing some of the cybercriminals'
p4
aVlatest and nastiest creations.
p5
aVSo basically, please don't go and download
p6
aVany of the viruses that I show you.
p7
aa(lp8
VSome of you might be wondering what a cybersecurity specialist looks like,
p9
aVand I thought I'd give you a quick insight
p10
aVinto my career so far.
p11
aVIt's a pretty accurate description.
p12
aVThis is what someone that specializes
p13
aVin malware and hacking looks like.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo today, computer viruses and trojans,
p16
aVdesigned to do everything from stealing data
p17
aVto watching you in your webcam
p18
aVto the theft of billions of dollars.
p19
aVSome malicious code today goes as far
p20
aVas targeting power, utilities and infrastructure.
p21
aa(lp22
VLet me give you a quick snapshot
p23
aVof what malicious code is capable of today.
p24
aVRight now, every second, eight new users
p25
aVare joining the Internet.
p26
aVToday, we will see 250,000 individual new computer viruses.
p27
aVWe will see 30,000 new infected websites.
p28
aVAnd, just to kind of tear down a myth here,
p29
aVlots of people think that when you get infected
p30
aVwith a computer virus, it's because you went to a porn site.
p31
aVRight? Well, actually, statistically speaking,
p32
aVif you only visit porn sites, you're safer.
p33
aVPeople normally write that down, by the way. (Laughter)
p34
aVActually, about 80 percent of these
p35
aVare small business websites getting infected.
p36
aa(lp37
VToday's cybercriminal, what do they look like?
p38
aVWell, many of you have the image, don't you,
p39
aVof the spotty teenager sitting in a basement,
p40
aVhacking away for notoriety.
p41
aVBut actually today, cybercriminals
p42
aVare wonderfully professional and organized.
p43
aVIn fact, they have product adverts.
p44
aVYou can go online and buy a hacking service
p45
aVto knock your business competitor offline.
p46
aVCheck out this one I found.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Video) Man: So you're here for one reason,
p49
aVand that reason is
p50
aVbecause you need your business competitors,
p51
aVrivals, haters, or whatever the reason is, or who,
p52
aVthey are to go down.
p53
aVWell you, my friend, you've came to the right place.
p54
aVIf you want your business competitors to go down,
p55
aVwell, they can.
p56
aVIf you want your rivals to go offline, well, they will.
p57
aVNot only that, we are providing a short-term-to-long-term
p58
aVDDOS service or scheduled attack,
p59
aVstarting five dollars per hour for small personal websites
p60
aVto 10 to 50 dollars per hour.
p61
aa(lp62
VJames Lyne: Now, I did actually pay
p63
aVone of these cybercriminals to attack my own website.
p64
aVThings got a bit tricky when I tried to expense it at the company.
p65
aVTurns out that's not cool.
p66
aVBut regardless, it's amazing how many products
p67
aVand services are available now to cybercriminals.
p68
aVFor example, this testing platform,
p69
aVwhich enables the cybercriminals
p70
aVto test the quality of their viruses
p71
aVbefore they release them on the world.
p72
aVFor a small fee, they can upload it
p73
aVand make sure everything is good.
p74
aa(lp75
VBut it goes further.
p76
aVCybercriminals now have crime packs
p77
aVwith business intelligence reporting dashboards
p78
aVto manage the distribution of their malicious code.
p79
aVThis is the market leader in malware distribution,
p80
aVthe Black Hole Exploit Pack,
p81
aVresponsible for nearly one third of malware distribution
p82
aVin the last couple of quarters.
p83
aVIt comes with technical installation guides,
p84
aVvideo setup routines,
p85
aVand get this, technical support.
p86
aVYou can email the cybercriminals and they'll tell you
p87
aVhow to set up your illegal hacking server.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo let me show you what malicious code looks like today.
p90
aVWhat I've got here is two systems,
p91
aVan attacker, which I've made look all Matrix-y and scary,
p92
aVand a victim, which you might recognize from home or work.
p93
aVNow normally, these would be on different sides
p94
aVof the planet or of the Internet,
p95
aVbut I've put them side by side
p96
aVbecause it makes things much more interesting.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow, there are many ways you can get infected.
p99
aVYou will have come in contact with some of them.
p100
aVMaybe some of you have received an email
p101
aVthat says something like, "Hi, I'm a Nigerian banker,
p102
aVand I'd like to give you 53 billion dollars
p103
aVbecause I like your face."
p104
aVOr funnycats.exe, which rumor has it
p105
aVwas quite successful in China's recent campaign against America.
p106
aa(lp107
VNow there are many ways you can get infected.
p108
aVI want to show you a couple of my favorites.
p109
aVThis is a little USB key.
p110
aVNow how do you get a USB key to run in a business?
p111
aVWell, you could try looking really cute.
p112
aVAwww.
p113
aVOr, in my case, awkward and pathetic.
p114
aVSo imagine this scenario: I walk into one of your businesses,
p115
aVlooking very awkward and pathetic, with a copy of my C.V.
p116
aVwhich I've covered in coffee,
p117
aVand I ask the receptionist to plug in this USB key
p118
aVand print me a new one.
p119
aVSo let's have a look here on my victim computer.
p120
aVWhat I'm going to do is plug in the USB key.
p121
aVAfter a couple of seconds,
p122
aVthings start to happen on the computer on their own,
p123
aVusually a bad sign.
p124
aVThis would, of course, normally happen
p125
aVin a couple of seconds, really, really quickly,
p126
aVbut I've kind of slowed it down
p127
aVso you can actually see the attack occurring.
p128
aVMalware is very boring otherwise.
p129
aVSo this is writing out the malicious code,
p130
aVand a few seconds later, on the left-hand side,
p131
aVyou'll see the attacker's screen get some interesting new text.
p132
aVNow if I place the mouse cursor over it,
p133
aVthis is what we call a command prompt,
p134
aVand using this we can navigate around the computer.
p135
aVWe can access your documents, your data.
p136
aVYou can turn on the webcam.
p137
aVThat can be very embarrassing.
p138
aVOr just to really prove a point,
p139
aVwe can launch programs like my personal favorite,
p140
aVthe Windows Calculator.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo isn't it amazing how much control
p143
aVthe attackers can get with such a simple operation?
p144
aVLet me show you how most malware
p145
aVis now distributed today.
p146
aVWhat I'm going to do is open up a website
p147
aVthat I wrote.
p148
aVIt's a terrible website. It's got really awful graphics.
p149
aVAnd it's got a comments section here
p150
aVwhere we can submit comments to the website.
p151
aVMany of you will have used something a bit like this before.
p152
aVUnfortunately, when this was implemented,
p153
aVthe developer was slightly inebriated
p154
aVand managed to forget
p155
aVall of the secure coding practices he had learned.
p156
aVSo let's imagine that our attacker,
p157
aVcalled Evil Hacker just for comedy value,
p158
aVinserts something a little nasty.
p159
aVThis is a script.
p160
aVIt's code which will be interpreted on the webpage.
p161
aVSo I'm going to submit this post,
p162
aVand then, on my victim computer,
p163
aVI'm going to open up the web browser
p164
aVand browse to my website,
p165
aVwww.incrediblyhacked.com.
p166
aVNotice that after a couple of seconds,
p167
aVI get redirected.
p168
aVThat website address at the top there,
p169
aVwhich you can just about see, microshaft.com,
p170
aVthe browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs,
p171
aVand up pops fake antivirus.
p172
aVThis is a virus pretending to look like antivirus software,
p173
aVand it will go through and it will scan the system,
p174
aVhave a look at what its popping up here.
p175
aVIt creates some very serious alerts.
p176
aVOh look, a child porn proxy server.
p177
aVWe really should clean that up.
p178
aVWhat's really insulting about this is
p179
aVnot only does it provide the attackers with access to your data,
p180
aVbut when the scan finishes, they tell you
p181
aVin order to clean up the fake viruses,
p182
aVyou have to register the product.
p183
aVNow I liked it better when viruses were free.
p184
aV(Laughter)
p185
aVPeople now pay cybercriminals money
p186
aVto run viruses,
p187
aVwhich I find utterly bizarre.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo anyway, let me change pace a little bit.
p190
aVChasing 250,000 pieces of malware a day
p191
aVis a massive challenge,
p192
aVand those numbers are only growing
p193
aVdirectly in proportion to the length of my stress line, you'll note here.
p194
aVSo I want to talk to you briefly
p195
aVabout a group of hackers we tracked for a year
p196
aVand actually found \u2014
p197
aVand this is a rare treat in our job.
p198
aVNow this was a cross-industry collaboration,
p199
aVpeople from Facebook, independent researchers,
p200
aVguys from Sophos.
p201
aVSo here we have a couple of documents
p202
aVwhich our cybercriminals had uploaded
p203
aVto a cloud service, kind of like Dropbox or SkyDrive,
p204
aVlike many of you might use.
p205
aVAt the top, you'll notice a section of source code.
p206
aVWhat this would do is send the cybercriminals
p207
aVa text message every day telling them how much money
p208
aVthey'd made that day,
p209
aVso a kind of cybercriminal billings report, if you will.
p210
aVIf you look closely, you'll notice a series
p211
aVof what are Russian telephone numbers.
p212
aVNow that's obviously interesting,
p213
aVbecause that gives us a way of finding our cybercriminals.
p214
aVDown below, highlighted in red,
p215
aVin the other section of source code,
p216
aVis this bit "leded:leded."
p217
aVThat's a username,
p218
aVkind of like you might have on Twitter.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo let's take this a little further.
p221
aVThere are a few other interesting pieces
p222
aVthe cybercriminals had uploaded.
p223
aVLots of you here will use smartphones
p224
aVto take photos and post them from the conference.
p225
aVAn interesting feature of lots of modern smartphones
p226
aVis that when you take a photo,
p227
aVit embeds GPS data about where that photo was taken.
p228
aVIn fact, I've been spending a lot of time
p229
aVon Internet dating sites recently,
p230
aVobviously for research purposes,
p231
aVand I've noticed that about 60 percent
p232
aVof the profile pictures on Internet dating sites
p233
aVcontain the GPS coordinates of where the photo was taken,
p234
aVwhich is kind of scary
p235
aVbecause you wouldn't give out your home address
p236
aVto lots of strangers,
p237
aVbut we're happy to give away our GPS coordinates
p238
aVto plus or minus 15 meters.
p239
aVAnd our cybercriminals had done the same thing.
p240
aVSo here's a photo which resolves to St. Petersburg.
p241
aVWe then deploy the incredibly advanced hacking tool.
p242
aVWe used Google.
p243
aVUsing the email address, the telephone number
p244
aVand the GPS data, on the left you see an advert
p245
aVfor a BMW that one of our cybercriminals is selling,
p246
aVon the other side an advert for the sale of sphynx kittens.
p247
aVOne of these was more stereotypical for me.
p248
aVA little more searching, and here's our cybercriminal.
p249
aVImagine, these are hardened cybercriminals
p250
aVsharing information scarcely.
p251
aVImagine what you could find
p252
aVabout each of the people in this room.
p253
aVA bit more searching through the profile
p254
aVand there's a photo of their office.
p255
aVThey were working on the third floor.
p256
aVAnd you can also see some photos
p257
aVfrom his business companion
p258
aVwhere he has a taste in a certain kind of image.
p259
aVIt turns out he's a member of the Russian Adult Webmasters Federation.
p260
aa(lp261
VBut this is where our investigation starts to slow down.
p262
aVThe cybercriminals have locked down their profiles quite well.
p263
aVAnd herein is the greatest lesson
p264
aVof social media and mobile devices for all of us right now.
p265
aVOur friends, our families and our colleagues
p266
aVcan break our security even when we do the right things.
p267
aVThis is MobSoft, one of the companies
p268
aVthat this cybercriminal gang owned,
p269
aVand an interesting thing about MobSoft
p270
aVis the 50-percent owner of this
p271
aVposted a job advert,
p272
aVand this job advert matched one of the telephone numbers
p273
aVfrom the code earlier.
p274
aVThis woman was Maria,
p275
aVand Maria is the wife of one of our cybercriminals.
p276
aVAnd it's kind of like she went into her social media settings
p277
aVand clicked on every option imaginable
p278
aVto make herself really, really insecure.
p279
aVBy the end of the investigation,
p280
aVwhere you can read the full 27-page report at that link,
p281
aVwe had photos of the cybercriminals,
p282
aVeven the office Christmas party
p283
aVwhen they were out on an outing.
p284
aVThat's right, cybercriminals do have Christmas parties,
p285
aVas it turns out.
p286
aVNow you're probably wondering what happened to these guys.
p287
aVLet me come back to that in just a minute.
p288
aa(lp289
VI want to change pace to one last little demonstration,
p290
aVa technique that is wonderfully simple and basic,
p291
aVbut is interesting in exposing how much information
p292
aVwe're all giving away,
p293
aVand it's relevant because it applies to us as a TED audience.
p294
aVThis is normally when people start kind of shuffling in their pockets
p295
aVtrying to turn their phones onto airplane mode desperately.
p296
aa(lp297
VMany of you all know about the concept
p298
aVof scanning for wireless networks.
p299
aVYou do it every time you take out your iPhone or your Blackberry
p300
aVand connect to something like TEDAttendees.
p301
aVBut what you might not know
p302
aVis that you're also beaming out a list of networks
p303
aVyou've previously connected to,
p304
aVeven when you're not using wireless actively.
p305
aVSo I ran a little scan.
p306
aVI was relatively inhibited compared to the cybercriminals,
p307
aVwho wouldn't be so concerned by law,
p308
aVand here you can see my mobile device.
p309
aVOkay? So you can see a list of wireless networks.
p310
aVTEDAttendees, HyattLB. Where do you think I'm staying?
p311
aVMy home network, PrettyFlyForAWifi,
p312
aVwhich I think is a great name.
p313
aVSophos_Visitors, SANSEMEA, companies I work with.
p314
aVLoganwifi, that's in Boston. HiltonLondon.
p315
aVCIASurveillanceVan.
p316
aVWe called it that at one of our conferences
p317
aVbecause we thought that would freak people out,
p318
aVwhich is quite fun.
p319
aVThis is how geeks party.
p320
aa(lp321
VSo let's make this a little bit more interesting.
p322
aVLet's talk about you.
p323
aVTwenty-three percent of you have been to Starbucks
p324
aVrecently and used the wireless network.
p325
aVThings get more interesting.
p326
aVForty-six percent of you I could link to a business,
p327
aVXYZ Employee network.
p328
aVThis isn't an exact science, but it gets pretty accurate.
p329
aVSeven hundred and sixty-one of you I could identify a hotel you'd been to recently,
p330
aVabsolutely with pinpoint precision somewhere on the globe.
p331
aVTwo hundred and thirty-four of you, well, I know where you live.
p332
aVYour wireless network name is so unique
p333
aVthat I was able to pinpoint it
p334
aVusing data available openly on the Internet
p335
aVwith no hacking or clever, clever tricks.
p336
aVAnd I should mention as well that
p337
aVsome of you do use your names,
p338
aV"James Lyne's iPhone," for example.
p339
aVAnd two percent of you have a tendency to extreme profanity.
p340
aa(lp341
VSo something for you to think about:
p342
aVAs we adopt these new applications and mobile devices,
p343
aVas we play with these shiny new toys,
p344
aVhow much are we trading off convenience
p345
aVfor privacy and security?
p346
aVNext time you install something,
p347
aVlook at the settings and ask yourself,
p348
aV"Is this information that I want to share?
p349
aVWould someone be able to abuse it?"
p350
aa(lp351
VWe also need to think very carefully
p352
aVabout how we develop our future talent pool.
p353
aVYou see, technology's changing at a staggering rate,
p354
aVand that 250,000 pieces of malware
p355
aVwon't stay the same for long.
p356
aVThere's a very concerning trend
p357
aVthat whilst many people coming out of schools now
p358
aVare much more technology-savvy, they know how to use technology,
p359
aVfewer and fewer people are following the feeder subjects
p360
aVto know how that technology works under the covers.
p361
aVIn the U.K., a 60 percent reduction since 2003,
p362
aVand there are similar statistics all over the world.
p363
aa(lp364
VWe also need to think about the legal issues in this area.
p365
aVThe cybercriminals I talked about,
p366
aVdespite theft of millions of dollars,
p367
aVactually still haven't been arrested,
p368
aVand at this point possibly never will.
p369
aVMost laws are national in their implementation,
p370
aVdespite cybercrime conventions, where the Internet
p371
aVis borderless and international by definition.
p372
aVCountries do not agree, which makes this area
p373
aVexceptionally challenging from a legal perspective.
p374
aa(lp375
VBut my biggest ask is this:
p376
aVYou see, you're going to leave here
p377
aVand you're going to see some astonishing stories in the news.
p378
aVYou're going to read about malware doing incredible
p379
aVand terrifying, scary things.
p380
aVHowever, 99 percent of it works
p381
aVbecause people fail to do the basics.
p382
aVSo my ask is this: Go online,
p383
aVfind these simple best practices,
p384
aVfind out how to update and patch your computer.
p385
aVGet a secure password.
p386
aVMake sure you use a different password
p387
aVon each of your sites and services online.
p388
aVFind these resources. Apply them.
p389
aa(lp390
VThe Internet is a fantastic resource
p391
aVfor business, for political expression,
p392
aVfor art and for learning.
p393
aVHelp me and the security community
p394
aVmake life much, much more difficult
p395
aVfor cybercriminals.
p396
aa(lp397
VThank you.
