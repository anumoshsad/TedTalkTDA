VI grew up
p4
aVdiagnosed as phobically shy,
p5
aVand, like at least 20 other people
p6
aVin a room of this size,
p7
aVI was a stutterer.
p8
aVDo you dare raise your hand?
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd it sticks with us. It really does stick with us,
p11
aVbecause when we are treated that way,
p12
aVwe feel invisible sometimes,
p13
aVor talked around and at.
p14
aVAnd as I started to look at people,
p15
aVwhich is mostly all I did,
p16
aVI noticed that some people
p17
aVreally wanted attention and recognition.
p18
aVRemember, I was young then.
p19
aVSo what did they do?
p20
aVWhat we still do perhaps too often.
p21
aVWe talk about ourselves.
p22
aVAnd yet there are other people I observed
p23
aVwho had what I called a mutuality mindset.
p24
aVIn each situation, they found a way to talk about us
p25
aVand create that "us" idea.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo my idea to reimagine the world
p28
aVis to see it one where we all become
p29
aVgreater opportunity-makers with and for others.
p30
aVThere's no greater opportunity
p31
aVor call for action for us now
p32
aVthan to become opportunity-makers
p33
aVwho use best talents together more often
p34
aVfor the greater good
p35
aVand accomplish things we couldn't have done on our own.
p36
aVAnd I want to talk to you about that,
p37
aVbecause even more than giving,
p38
aVeven more than giving,
p39
aVis the capacity for us to do something smarter
p40
aVtogether for the greater good
p41
aVthat lifts us both up
p42
aVand that can scale.
p43
aVThat's why I'm sitting here.
p44
aVBut I also want to point something else out:
p45
aVEach one of you
p46
aVis better than anybody else at something.
p47
aVThat disproves that popular notion
p48
aVthat if you're the smartest person in the room,
p49
aVyou're in the wrong room.
p50
aV(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VSo let me tell you about
p53
aVa Hollywood party I went to a couple years back,
p54
aVand I met this up-and-coming actress,
p55
aVand we were soon talking about something
p56
aVthat we both felt passionately about: public art.
p57
aVAnd she had the fervent belief
p58
aVthat every new building in Los Angeles
p59
aVshould have public art in it.
p60
aVShe wanted a regulation for it,
p61
aVand she fervently started \u2014
p62
aVwho is here from Chicago? \u2014
p63
aVshe fervently started talking about
p64
aVthese bean-shaped reflective sculptures
p65
aVin Millennium Park,
p66
aVand people would walk up to it
p67
aVand they'd smile in the reflection of it,
p68
aVand they'd pose and they'd vamp
p69
aVand they'd take selfies together,
p70
aVand they'd laugh.
p71
aVAnd as she was talking, a  thought came to my mind.
p72
aVI said, "I know someone you ought to meet.
p73
aVHe's getting out of San Quentin  in a couple of weeks" \u2014
p74
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p75
aV"and he shares your fervent desire
p76
aVthat art should engage and enable people to connect."
p77
aVHe spent five years in solitary,
p78
aVand I met him because I gave a speech at San Quentin,
p79
aVand he's articulate
p80
aVand he's rather easy on  the eyes because he's buff.
p81
aVHe had workout regime he did every day.
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aVI think she was following me at that point.
p84
aVI said, "He'd be an unexpected ally."
p85
aVAnd not just that. There's James. He's an architect
p86
aVand he's a professor, and he loves place-making,
p87
aVand place-making is when you have
p88
aVthose mini-plazas and those urban walkways
p89
aVand where they're dotted with art,
p90
aVwhere people draw and  come up and talk sometimes.
p91
aVI think they'd make good allies.
p92
aVAnd indeed they were.
p93
aVThey met together. They prepared.
p94
aVThey spoke in front of the  Los Angeles City Council.
p95
aVAnd the council members not only passed the regulation,
p96
aVhalf of them came down and asked to pose with them afterwards.
p97
aVThey were startling,  compelling and credible.
p98
aVYou can't buy that.
p99
aa(lp100
VWhat I'm asking you to consider
p101
aVis what kind of opportunity- makers we might become,
p102
aVbecause more than wealth
p103
aVor fancy titles
p104
aVor a lot of contacts, it's our capacity to connect
p105
aVaround each other's  better side and bring it out.
p106
aVAnd I'm not saying this is easy,
p107
aVand I'm sure many of you have made the wrong moves too
p108
aVabout who you wanted to connect with,
p109
aVbut what I want to suggest is,
p110
aVthis is an opportunity.
p111
aVI started thinking about it
p112
aVway back when I was a  Wall Street Journal reporter
p113
aVand I was in Europe and I was supposed to cover trends
p114
aVand trends that transcended business
p115
aVor politics or lifestyle.
p116
aVSo I had to have contacts
p117
aVin different worlds very different than mine,
p118
aVbecause otherwise you couldn't spot the trends.
p119
aVAnd third, I had to write the story
p120
aVin a way stepping into the reader's shoes,
p121
aVso they could see how these  trends could affect their lives.
p122
aVThat's what opportunity-makers do.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd here's a strange thing:
p125
aVUnlike an increasing number of Americans
p126
aVwho are working and living  and playing with people
p127
aVwho think exactly like them
p128
aVbecause we then become more rigid and extreme,
p129
aVopportunity-makers are actively seeking situations
p130
aVwith people unlike them,
p131
aVand they're building relationships,
p132
aVand because they do that,
p133
aVthey have trusted relationships
p134
aVwhere they can bring the right team in
p135
aVand recruit them to solve a  problem better and faster
p136
aVand seize more opportunities.
p137
aVThey're not affronted by differences,
p138
aVthey're fascinated by them,
p139
aVand that is a huge shift in mindset,
p140
aVand once you feel it, you  want it to happen a lot more.
p141
aVThis world is calling out for us  to have a collective mindset,
p142
aVand I believe in doing that.
p143
aVIt's especially important now.
p144
aVWhy is it important now?
p145
aVBecause things can be devised like drones
p146
aVand drugs and data collection,
p147
aVand they can be devised by more people
p148
aVand cheaper ways for beneficial purposes
p149
aVand then, as we know from the news every day,
p150
aVthey can be used for dangerous ones.
p151
aVIt calls on us, each of us,
p152
aVto a higher calling.
p153
aa(lp154
VBut here's the icing on the cake:
p155
aVIt's not just the first opportunity
p156
aVthat you do with somebody else
p157
aVthat's probably your greatest,
p158
aVas an institution or an individual.
p159
aVIt's after you've had that experience
p160
aVand you trust each other.
p161
aVIt's the unexpected things
p162
aVthat you devise later on
p163
aVyou never could have predicted.
p164
aVFor example, Marty is the husband  of that actress I mentioned,
p165
aVand he watched them  when they were practicing,
p166
aVand he was soon talking to Wally,
p167
aVmy friend the ex-con,
p168
aVabout that exercise regime.
p169
aVAnd he thought,
p170
aVI have a set of racquetball courts.
p171
aVThat guy could teach it.
p172
aVA lot of people who work there are members at my courts.
p173
aVThey're frequent travelers.
p174
aVThey could practice in their hotel room,
p175
aVno equipment provided.
p176
aVThat's how Wally got hired.
p177
aVNot only that, years later
p178
aVhe was also teaching racquetball.
p179
aVYears after that,
p180
aVhe was teaching the racquetball teachers.
p181
aVWhat I'm suggesting is, when  you connect with people
p182
aVaround a shared interest and action,
p183
aVyou're accustomed to serendipitous
p184
aVthings happening into the future,
p185
aVand I think that's what we're looking at.
p186
aVWe open ourselves up to those opportunities,
p187
aVand in this room  are key players in technology,
p188
aVkey players who are uniquely positioned to do this,
p189
aVto scale systems and projects together.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo here's what I'm calling for you to do.
p192
aVRemember the three traits of opportunity-makers.
p193
aVOpportunity-makers keep honing their top strength
p194
aVand they become pattern seekers.
p195
aVThey get involved in different  worlds than their worlds
p196
aVso they're trusted and they  can see those patterns,
p197
aVand they communicate to connect
p198
aVaround sweet spots of shared interest.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo what I'm asking you is,
p201
aVthe world is hungry.
p202
aVI truly believe, in my firsthand experience,
p203
aVthe world is hungry for us
p204
aVto unite together as opportunity-makers
p205
aVand to emulate those behaviors
p206
aVas so many of you already do \u2014
p207
aVI know that firsthand \u2014
p208
aVand to reimagine a world
p209
aVwhere we use our best talents together
p210
aVmore often to accomplish greater things together
p211
aVthan we could on our own.
p212
aVJust remember,
p213
aVas Dave Liniger once said,
p214
aV"You can't succeed
p215
aVcoming to the potluck with only a fork."
p216
aV(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VThank you very much.
p219
aVThank you. (Applause)
