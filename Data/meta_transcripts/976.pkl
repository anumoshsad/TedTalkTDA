VSometimes I go browsing
p4
aV[through] a very old magazine.
p5
aVI found this observation test
p6
aVabout the story of the ark.
p7
aVAnd the artist that drew this observation test
p8
aVdid some errors, had some mistakes \u2014
p9
aVthere are more or less 12 mistakes.
p10
aVSome of them are very easy.
p11
aVThere is a funnel, an aerial part,
p12
aVa lamp and clockwork key on the ark.
p13
aVSome of them are about the animals, the number.
p14
aVBut there is a much more fundamental mistake
p15
aVin the overall story of the ark
p16
aVthat's not reported here.
p17
aVAnd this problem is: where are the plants?
p18
aVSo now we have God
p19
aVthat is going to submerge Earth permanently
p20
aVor at least for a very long period,
p21
aVand no one is taking care of plants.
p22
aVNoah needed to take two of every kind of bird,
p23
aVof every kind of animal,
p24
aVof every kind of creature that moves,
p25
aVbut no mention about plants.
p26
aVWhy?
p27
aVIn another part of the same story,
p28
aVall the living creatures
p29
aVare just the living creatures
p30
aVthat came out from the ark,
p31
aVso birds, livestock and wild animals.
p32
aVPlants are not living creatures \u2014
p33
aVthis is the point.
p34
aVThat is a point that is not
p35
aVcoming out from the Bible,
p36
aVbut it's something that
p37
aVreally accompanied humanity.
p38
aa(lp39
VLet's have a look at this nice code
p40
aVthat is coming from a Renaissance book.
p41
aVHere we have the description
p42
aVof the order of nature.
p43
aVIt's a nice description because it's starting from left \u2014
p44
aVyou have the stones \u2014
p45
aVimmediately after the stones, the plants
p46
aVthat are just able to live.
p47
aVWe have the animals that are able to live and to sense,
p48
aVand on the top of the pyramid,
p49
aVthere is the man.
p50
aVThis is not the common man.
p51
aVThe "Homo studiosus" \u2014 the studying man.
p52
aVThis is quite comforting
p53
aVfor people like me \u2014 I'm a professor \u2014
p54
aVthis to be over there on the top of creation.
p55
aVBut it's something completely wrong.
p56
aVYou know very well about professors.
p57
aVBut it's also wrong about plants,
p58
aVbecause plants are not just able to live;
p59
aVthey are able to sense.
p60
aVThey are much more sophisticated
p61
aVin sensing than animals.
p62
aVJust to give you an example,
p63
aVevery single root apex
p64
aVis able to detect and to monitor
p65
aVconcurrently and continuously
p66
aVat least 15 different chemical
p67
aVand physical parameters.
p68
aVAnd they also are able to show and to exhibit
p69
aVsuch a wonderful and complex behavior
p70
aVthat can be described just with the term of intelligence.
p71
aVWell, but this is something \u2014
p72
aVthis underestimation of plants is something
p73
aVthat is always with us.
p74
aa(lp75
VLet's have a look at this short movie now.
p76
aVWe have David Attenborough.
p77
aVNow David Attenborough is really a plant lover;
p78
aVhe did some of the most beautiful movies
p79
aVabout plant behavior.
p80
aVNow, when he speaks about plants,
p81
aVeverything is correct.
p82
aVWhen he speaks about animals,
p83
aV[he] tends to remove the fact
p84
aVthat plants exist.
p85
aVThe blue whale,
p86
aVthe biggest creature that exists on the planet \u2014
p87
aVthat is wrong, completely wrong.
p88
aVThe blue whale, it's a dwarf
p89
aVif compared with the real biggest creature
p90
aVthat exists on the planet \u2014
p91
aVthat is, this wonderful,
p92
aVmagnificent Sequoiadendron giganteum.
p93
aV(Applause)
p94
aVAnd this is a living organism
p95
aVthat has a mass of at least 2,000 tons.
p96
aVNow, the story
p97
aVthat plants are some low-level organisms
p98
aVhas been formalized
p99
aVmany times ago by Aristotle,
p100
aVthat in "De Anima" \u2014
p101
aVthat is a very influential book for the Western civilization \u2014
p102
aVwrote that the plants are on the edge
p103
aVbetween living and not living.
p104
aVThey have just a kind of very low-level soul.
p105
aVIt's called the vegetative soul,
p106
aVbecause they lack movement,
p107
aVand so they don't need to sense.
p108
aVLet's see.
p109
aa(lp110
VOkay, some of the movements of the plants are very well-known.
p111
aVThis is a very fast movement.
p112
aVThis is a Dionaea, a Venus fly trap
p113
aVhunting snails \u2014
p114
aVsorry for the snail.
p115
aVThis has been something that has been refused for centuries,
p116
aVdespite the evidence.
p117
aVNo one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal,
p118
aVbecause it was against the order of nature.
p119
aVBut plants are also able
p120
aVto show a lot of movement.
p121
aVSome of them are very well known, like the flowering.
p122
aVIt's just a question to use some techniques
p123
aVlike the time lapse.
p124
aVSome of them are much more sophisticated.
p125
aVLook at this young bean
p126
aVthat is moving to catch the light every time.
p127
aVAnd it's really so graceful;
p128
aVit's like a dancing angel.
p129
aVThey are also able to play \u2014
p130
aVthey are really playing.
p131
aVThese are young sunflowers,
p132
aVand what they are doing
p133
aVcannot be described
p134
aVwith any other terms than playing.
p135
aVThey are training themselves,
p136
aVas many young animals do,
p137
aVto the adult life
p138
aVwhere they will be called to track the sun
p139
aVall the day.
p140
aVThey are able to respond to gravity, of course,
p141
aVso the shoots are growing
p142
aVagainst the vector of gravity
p143
aVand the roots toward the vector of gravity.
p144
aVBut they are also able to sleep.
p145
aVThis is one, Mimosa pudica.
p146
aVSo during the night,
p147
aVthey curl the leaves
p148
aVand reduce the movement,
p149
aVand during the day, you have the opening of the leaves \u2014
p150
aVthere is much more movement.
p151
aVThis is interesting
p152
aVbecause this sleeping machinery,
p153
aVit's perfectly conserved.
p154
aVIt's the same in plants, in insects
p155
aVand in animals.
p156
aVAnd so if you need to study this sleeping problem,
p157
aVit's easy to study on plants, for example,
p158
aVthan in animals
p159
aVand it's much more easy even ethically.
p160
aVIt's a kind of vegetarian
p161
aVexperimentation.
p162
aa(lp163
VPlants are even able to communicate \u2014
p164
aVthey are extraordinary communicators.
p165
aVThey communicate with other plants.
p166
aVThey are able to distinguish kin and non-kin.
p167
aVThey communicate
p168
aVwith plants of other species
p169
aVand they communicate with animals
p170
aVby producing chemical volatiles,
p171
aVfor example, during the pollination.
p172
aVNow with the pollination, it's a very serious issue for plants,
p173
aVbecause they move the pollen from one flower to the other,
p174
aVyet they cannot move from one flower to the other.
p175
aVSo they need a vector \u2014
p176
aVand this vector,
p177
aVit's normally an animal.
p178
aVMany insects
p179
aVhave been used by plants as vectors
p180
aVfor the transport of the pollination,
p181
aVbut not just insects; even birds, reptiles,
p182
aVand mammals like bats rats
p183
aVare normally used for the transportation of the pollen.
p184
aVThis is a serious business.
p185
aVWe have the plants that are giving to the animals
p186
aVa kind of sweet substance \u2014
p187
aVvery energizing \u2014
p188
aVhaving in change this transportation of the pollen.
p189
aVBut some plants are manipulating animals,
p190
aVlike in the case of orchids
p191
aVthat promise sex and nectar
p192
aVand give in change nothing
p193
aVfor the transportation of the pollen.
p194
aa(lp195
VNow, there is a big problem
p196
aVbehind all this behavior that we have seen.
p197
aVHow is it possible to do this without a brain?
p198
aVWe need to wait until 1880,
p199
aVwhen this big man,
p200
aVCharles Darwin,
p201
aVpublishes a wonderful, astonishing book
p202
aVthat starts a revolution.
p203
aVThe title is "The Power of Movement in Plants."
p204
aVNo one was allowed to speak about movement in plants
p205
aVbefore Charles Darwin.
p206
aVIn his book,
p207
aVassisted by his son, Francis \u2014
p208
aVwho was the first professor of plant physiology in the world, in Cambridge \u2014
p209
aVthey took into consideration every single movement
p210
aVfor 500 pages.
p211
aVAnd in the last paragraph of the book,
p212
aVit's a kind of stylistic mark,
p213
aVbecause normally Charles Darwin stored,
p214
aVin the last paragraph of a book,
p215
aVthe most important message.
p216
aVHe wrote that,
p217
aV"It's hardly an exaggeration
p218
aVto say that the tip of the radical
p219
aVacts like the brain
p220
aVof one of the lower animals."
p221
aVThis is not a metaphor.
p222
aVHe wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends
p223
aVwho was J.D. Hooker, or at that time, president of the Royal Society,
p224
aVso the maximum scientific authority in Britain
p225
aVspeaking about the brain in the plants.
p226
aa(lp227
VNow, this is a root apex
p228
aVgrowing against a slope.
p229
aVSo you can recognize this kind of movement,
p230
aVthe same movement that worms, snakes
p231
aVand every animal
p232
aVthat are moving on the ground without legs
p233
aVis able to display.
p234
aVAnd it's not an easy movement
p235
aVbecause, to have this kind of movement,
p236
aVyou need to move different regions of the root
p237
aVand to synchronize these different regions
p238
aVwithout having a brain.
p239
aVSo we studied the root apex
p240
aVand we found that there is a specific region
p241
aVthat is here, depicted in blue \u2014
p242
aVthat is called the "transition zone."
p243
aVAnd this region, it's a very small region \u2014
p244
aVit's less than one millimeter.
p245
aVAnd in this small region
p246
aVyou have the highest consumption
p247
aVof oxygen in the plants
p248
aVand more important,
p249
aVyou have these kinds of signals here.
p250
aVThe signals that you are seeing here are action potential,
p251
aVare the same signals
p252
aVthat the neurons of my brain, of our brain,
p253
aVuse to exchange information.
p254
aVNow we know that a root apex
p255
aVhas just a few hundred cells
p256
aVthat show this kind of feature,
p257
aVbut we know how big
p258
aVthe root apparatus of a small plant, like a plant of rye.
p259
aVWe have almost
p260
aV14 million roots.
p261
aVWe have 11 and a half million
p262
aVroot apex
p263
aVand a total length of 600 or more kilometers
p264
aVand a very high surface area.
p265
aa(lp266
VNow let's imagine
p267
aVthat each single root apex
p268
aVis working in network with all the others.
p269
aVHere were have on the left, the Internet
p270
aVand on the right, the root apparatus.
p271
aVThey work in the same way.
p272
aVThey are a network
p273
aVof small computing machines,
p274
aVworking in networks.
p275
aVAnd why are they so similar?
p276
aVBecause they evolved
p277
aVfor the same reason:
p278
aVto survive predation.
p279
aVThey work in the same way.
p280
aVSo you can remove 90 percent of the root apparatus
p281
aVand the plants [continue] to work.
p282
aVYou can remove 90 percent of the Internet
p283
aVand it is [continuing] to work.
p284
aVSo, a suggestion
p285
aVfor the people working with networks:
p286
aVplants are able
p287
aVto give you good suggestions
p288
aVabout how to evolve networks.
p289
aa(lp290
VAnd another possibility
p291
aVis a technological possibility.
p292
aVLet's imagine
p293
aVthat we can build robots
p294
aVand robots that are inspired by plants.
p295
aVUntil now,
p296
aVthe man was inspired
p297
aVjust by man or the animals
p298
aVin producing a robot.
p299
aVWe have the animaloid \u2014
p300
aVand the normal robots inspired by animals,
p301
aVinsectoid, so on.
p302
aVWe have the androids
p303
aVthat are inspired by man.
p304
aVBut why have we not any plantoid?
p305
aVWell, if you want to fly,
p306
aVit's good that you look at birds \u2014
p307
aVto be inspired by birds.
p308
aVBut if you want to explore soils,
p309
aVor if you want to colonize
p310
aVnew territory,
p311
aVto best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants
p312
aVthat are masters in doing this.
p313
aVWe have another possibility
p314
aVwe are working [on] in our lab,
p315
aV[which] is to build hybrids.
p316
aVIt's much more easy to build hybrids.
p317
aVHybrid means it's something
p318
aVthat's half living and half machine.
p319
aVIt's much more easy to work with plants
p320
aVthan with animals.
p321
aVThey have computing power,
p322
aVthey have electrical signals.
p323
aVThe connection with the machine is much more easy,
p324
aVmuch more even ethically possible.
p325
aVAnd these are three possibilities
p326
aVthat we are working on
p327
aVto build hybrids,
p328
aVdriven by algae
p329
aVor by the leaves at the end,
p330
aVby the most, most powerful parts of the plants,
p331
aVby the roots.
p332
aa(lp333
VWell, thank you for your attention.
p334
aVAnd before I finish,
p335
aVI would like to reassure that no snails were harmed
p336
aVin making this presentation.
p337
aVThank you.
