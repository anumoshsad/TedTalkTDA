VSo I'll be talking about the success of my campus,
p4
aVthe University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC,
p5
aVin educating students of all types,
p6
aVacross the arts and humanities and the science and engineering areas.
p7
aVWhat makes our story especially important
p8
aVis that we have learned so much from a group of students
p9
aVwho are typically not at the top of the academic ladder \u2014
p10
aVstudents of color, students underrepresented in selected areas.
p11
aVAnd what makes the story especially unique
p12
aVis that we have learned how to help African-American students, Latino students,
p13
aVstudents from low-income backgrounds,
p14
aVto become some of the best in the world in science and engineering.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd so I begin with a story about my childhood.
p17
aVWe all are products of our childhood experiences.
p18
aVIt's hard for me to believe that it's been 50 years
p19
aVsince I had the experience of being a ninth grade kid in Birmingham, Alabama,
p20
aVa kid who loved getting A's,
p21
aVa kid who loved math, who loved to read,
p22
aVa kid who would say to the teacher \u2014
p23
aVwhen the teacher said, "Here are 10 problems," to the class,
p24
aVthis little fat kid would say, "Give us 10 more."
p25
aVAnd the whole class would say, "Shut up, Freeman."
p26
aVAnd there was a designated kicker every day.
p27
aVAnd so I was always asking this question:
p28
aV"Well how could we get more kids to really love to learn?"
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd amazingly, one week in church,
p31
aVwhen I really didn't want to be there
p32
aVand I was in the back of the room being placated by doing math problems,
p33
aVI heard this man say this:
p34
aV"If we can get the children
p35
aVto participate in this peaceful demonstration here in Birmingham,
p36
aVwe can show America that even children know the difference between right and wrong
p37
aVand that children really do want to get the best possible education."
p38
aVAnd I looked up and said, "Who is that man?"
p39
aVAnd they said his name was Dr. Martin Luther King.
p40
aVAnd I said to my parents, "I've got to go.
p41
aVI want to go. I want to be a part of this."
p42
aVAnd they said, "Absolutely not."
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd we had a rough go of it.
p47
aVAnd at that time, quite frankly, you really did not talk back to your parents.
p48
aVAnd somehow I said, "You know, you guys are hypocrites.
p49
aVYou make me go to this. You make me listen.
p50
aVThe man wants me to go, and now you say no."
p51
aVAnd they thought about it all night.
p52
aVAnd they came into my room the next morning.
p53
aVThey had not slept.
p54
aVThey had been literally crying and praying and thinking,
p55
aV"Will we let our 12-year-old
p56
aVparticipate in this march and probably have to go to jail?"
p57
aVAnd they decided to do it.
p58
aVAnd when they came in to tell me,
p59
aVI was at first elated.
p60
aVAnd then all of a sudden I began thinking about the dogs and the fire hoses,
p61
aVand I got really scared, I really did.
p62
aVAnd one of the points I make to people all the time
p63
aVis that sometimes when people do things that are courageous,
p64
aVit doesn't really mean that they're that courageous.
p65
aVIt simply means that they believe it's important to do it.
p66
aa(lp67
VI wanted a better education.
p68
aVI did not want to have to have hand-me-down books.
p69
aVI wanted to know that the school I attended
p70
aVnot only had good teachers, but the resources we needed.
p71
aVAnd as a result of that experience,
p72
aVin the middle of the week, while I was there in jail,
p73
aVDr. King came and said with our parents,
p74
aV"What you children do this day
p75
aVwill have an impact on children who have not been born."
p76
aa(lp77
VI recently realized that two-thirds of Americans today
p78
aVhad not been born at the time of 1963.
p79
aVAnd so for them, when they hear about the Children's Crusade in Birmingham,
p80
aVin many ways, if they see it on TV,
p81
aVit's like our looking at the 1863 "Lincoln" movie:
p82
aVIt's history.
p83
aVAnd the real question is, what lessons did we learn?
p84
aVWell amazingly, the most important for me was this:
p85
aVThat children can be empowered to take ownership of their education.
p86
aVThey can be taught to be passionate
p87
aVabout wanting to learn and to love the idea of asking questions.
p88
aa(lp89
VAnd so it is especially significant
p90
aVthat the university I now lead,
p91
aVthe University of Maryland, Baltimore County, UMBC,
p92
aVwas founded the very year I went to jail with Dr. King, in 1963.
p93
aVAnd what made that institutional founding especially important
p94
aVis that Maryland is the South, as you know,
p95
aVand, quite frankly, it was the first university in our state
p96
aVfounded at a time when students of all races could go there.
p97
aVAnd so we had black and white students and others who began to attend.
p98
aVAnd it has been for 50 years an experiment.
p99
aVThe experiment is this:
p100
aVIs it possible to have institutions in our country, universities,
p101
aVwhere people from all backgrounds can come and learn
p102
aVand learn to work together and learn to become leaders
p103
aVand to support each other in that experience?
p104
aa(lp105
VNow what is especially important about that experience for me is this:
p106
aVWe found that we could do a lot in the arts and humanities and social sciences.
p107
aVAnd so we began to work on that, for years in the '60s.
p108
aVAnd we produced a number of people in law, all the way to the humanities.
p109
aVWe produced great artists. Beckett is our muse.
p110
aVA lot of our students get into theater.
p111
aVIt's great work.
p112
aVThe problem that we faced was the same problem America continues to face \u2014
p113
aVthat students in the sciences and engineering,
p114
aVblack students were not succeeding.
p115
aVBut when I looked at the data,
p116
aVwhat I found was that, quite frankly, students in general,
p117
aVlarge numbers were not making it.
p118
aVAnd as a result of that,
p119
aVwe decided to do something that would help, first of all,
p120
aVthe group at the bottom, African-American students, and then Hispanic students.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd Robert and Jane Meyerhoff, philanthropists, said, "We'd like to help."
p123
aVRobert Meyerhoff said, "Why is it that everything I see on TV about black boys,
p124
aVif it's not about basketball, is not positive?
p125
aVI'd like to make a difference, to do something that's positive."
p126
aVWe married those ideas, and we created this Meyerhoff Scholars program.
p127
aVAnd what is significant about the program
p128
aVis that we learned a number of things.
p129
aVAnd the question is this:
p130
aVHow is it that now we lead the country in producing African-Americans
p131
aVwho go on to complete Ph.D.'s in science and engineering and M.D./Ph.D.'s?
p132
aVThat's a big deal. Give me a hand for that. That's a big deal.
p133
aVThat's a big deal. It really is.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Applause)
p136
aa(lp137
VYou see, most people don't realize
p138
aVthat it's not just minorities who don't do well in science and engineering.
p139
aVQuite frankly, you're talking about Americans.
p140
aVIf you don't know it, while 20 percent of blacks and Hispanics
p141
aVwho begin with a major in science and engineering
p142
aVwill actually graduate in science and engineering,
p143
aVonly 32 percent of whites who begin with majors in those areas
p144
aVactually succeed and graduate in those areas,
p145
aVand only 42 percent of Asian-Americans.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd so, the real question is, what is the challenge?
p148
aVWell a part of it, of course, is K-12.
p149
aVWe need to strengthen K-12.
p150
aVBut the other part has to do with the culture
p151
aVof science and engineering on our campuses.
p152
aVWhether you know it or not, large numbers of students with high SAT's
p153
aVand large numbers of A.P. credits
p154
aVwho go to the most prestigious universities in our country
p155
aVbegin in pre-med or pre-engineering and engineering, and they end up changing their majors.
p156
aVAnd the number one reason, we find, quite frankly,
p157
aVis they did not do well in first year science courses.
p158
aVIn fact, we call first year science and engineering, typically around America,
p159
aVweed-out courses or barrier courses.
p160
aa(lp161
VHow many of you in this audience know somebody
p162
aVwho started off in pre-med or engineering
p163
aVand changed their major within a year or two?
p164
aVIt's an American challenge. Half of you in the room.
p165
aVI know. I know. I know.
p166
aVAnd what is interesting about that
p167
aVis that so many students are smart and can do it.
p168
aVWe need to find ways of making it happen.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo what are the four things we did to help minority students
p171
aVthat now are helping students in general?
p172
aVNumber one: high expectations.
p173
aVIt takes an understanding of the academic preparation of students \u2014
p174
aVtheir grades, the rigor of the course work,
p175
aVtheir test-taking skills, their attitude,
p176
aVthe fire in their belly, the passion for the work, to make it.
p177
aVAnd so doing things to help students prepare to be in that position, very important.
p178
aVBut equally important, it takes an understanding that it's hard work that makes the difference.
p179
aVI don't care how smart you are or how smart you think you are.
p180
aVSmart simply means you're ready to learn.
p181
aVYou're excited about learning and you want to ask good questions.
p182
aa(lp183
VI. I. Rabi, a Nobel laureate, said that when he was growing up in New York,
p184
aVall of his friends' parents would ask them
p185
aV"What did you learn in school?" at the end of a day.
p186
aVAnd he said, in contrast, his Jewish mother would say,
p187
aV"Izzy, did you ask a good question today?"
p188
aVAnd so high expectations have to do with curiosity
p189
aVand encouraging young people to be curious.
p190
aVAnd as a result of those high expectations,
p191
aVwe began to find students we wanted to work with
p192
aVto see what could we do to help them,
p193
aVnot simply to survive in science and engineering,
p194
aVbut to become the very best, to excel.
p195
aa(lp196
VInterestingly enough, an example:
p197
aVOne young man who earned a C in the first course and wanted to go on to med school,
p198
aVwe said, "We need to have you retake the course,
p199
aVbecause you need a strong foundation if you're going to move to the next level."
p200
aVEvery foundation makes the difference in the next level.
p201
aVHe retook the course.
p202
aVThat young man went on to graduate from UMBC,
p203
aVto become the first black to get the M.D./Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania.
p204
aVHe now works at Harvard.
p205
aVNice story. Give him a hand for that too.
p206
aa(lp207
V(Applause)
p208
aa(lp209
VSecondly, it's not about test scores only.
p210
aVTest scores are important, but they're not the most important thing.
p211
aVOne young woman had great grades, but test scores were not as high.
p212
aVBut she had a factor that was very important.
p213
aVShe never missed a day of school, K-12.
p214
aVThere was fire in that belly.
p215
aVThat young woman went on, and she is today with an M.D./Ph.D. from Hopkins.
p216
aVShe's on the faculty, tenure track in psychiatry, Ph.D. in neuroscience.
p217
aVShe and her adviser have a patent on a second use of Viagra for diabetes patients.
p218
aVBig hand for her. Big hand for her.
p219
aV(Applause)
p220
aVAnd so high expectations, very important.
p221
aa(lp222
VSecondly, the idea of building community among the students.
p223
aVYou all know that so often in science and engineering
p224
aVwe tend to think cutthroat.
p225
aVStudents are not taught to work in groups.
p226
aVAnd that's what we work to do with that group
p227
aVto get them to understand each other,
p228
aVto build trust among them, to support each other,
p229
aVto learn how to ask good questions,
p230
aVbut also to learn how to explain concepts with clarity.
p231
aVAs you know, it's one thing to earn an A yourself,
p232
aVit's another thing to help someone else do well.
p233
aVAnd so to feel that sense of responsibility makes all the difference in the world.
p234
aVSo building community among those students, very important.
p235
aa(lp236
VThird, the idea of, it takes researchers to produce researchers.
p237
aVWhether you're talking about artists producing artists
p238
aVor you're talking about people getting into the social sciences,
p239
aVwhatever the discipline \u2014 and especially in science and engineering, as in art, for example \u2014
p240
aVyou need scientists to pull the students into the work.
p241
aVAnd so our students are working in labs regularly.
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd one great example that you'll appreciate:
p244
aVDuring a snowstorm in Baltimore several years ago,
p245
aVthe guy on our campus with this Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant
p246
aVliterally came back to work in his lab after several days,
p247
aVand all these students had refused to leave the lab.
p248
aVThey had food they had packed out.
p249
aVThey were in the lab working,
p250
aVand they saw the work, not as schoolwork, but as their lives.
p251
aVThey knew they were working on AIDS research.
p252
aVThey were looking at this amazing protein design.
p253
aVAnd what was interesting was each one of them focused on that work.
p254
aVAnd he said, "It doesn't get any better than that."
p255
aa(lp256
VAnd then finally, if you've got the community
p257
aVand you've got the high expectations and you've got researchers producing researchers,
p258
aVyou have to have people who are willing as faculty
p259
aVto get involved with those students, even in the classroom.
p260
aVI'll never forget a faculty member calling the staff and saying,
p261
aV"I've got this young man in class, a young black guy,
p262
aVand he seems like he's just not excited about the work.
p263
aVHe's not taking notes. We need to talk to him."
p264
aVWhat was significant was that the faculty member was observing every student
p265
aVto understand who was really involved and who was not
p266
aVand was saying, "Let me see how I can work with them.
p267
aVLet me get the staff to help me out."
p268
aVIt was that connecting.
p269
aVThat young man today is actually a faculty member M.D./Ph.D. in neuroengineering at Duke.
p270
aVGive him a big hand for that.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Applause)
p273
aa(lp274
VAnd so the significance is that we have now developed this model
p275
aVthat is helping us, not only finally with evaluation, assessing what works.
p276
aVAnd what we learned was that we needed to think about redesigning courses.
p277
aVAnd so we redesigned chemistry, we redesigned physics.
p278
aVBut now we are looking at redesigning the humanities and social sciences.
p279
aVBecause so many students are bored in class.
p280
aVDo you know that?
p281
aVMany students, K-12 and in universities,
p282
aVdon't want to just sit there and listen to somebody talk.
p283
aVThey need to be engaged.
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd so we have done \u2014 if you look at our website at the Chemistry Discovery Center,
p286
aVyou'll see people coming from all over the country
p287
aVto look at how we are redesigning courses,
p288
aVhaving an emphasis on collaboration, use of technology,
p289
aVusing problems out of our biotech companies on our campus,
p290
aVand not giving students the theories,
p291
aVbut having them struggle with those theories.
p292
aVAnd it's working so well that throughout our university system in Maryland,
p293
aVmore and more courses are being redesigned.
p294
aa(lp295
VIt's called academic innovation.
p296
aa(lp297
VAnd what does all of that mean?
p298
aVIt means that now, not just in science and engineering,
p299
aVwe now have programs in the arts, in the humanities, in the social sciences,
p300
aVin teacher education, even particularly for women in I.T.
p301
aVIf you don't know it, there's been a 79-percent decline
p302
aVin the number of women majoring in computer science just since 2000.
p303
aVAnd what I'm saying is that what will make the difference
p304
aVwill be building community among students,
p305
aVtelling young women, young minority students and students in general,
p306
aVyou can do this work.
p307
aVAnd most important, giving them a chance to build that community
p308
aVwith faculty pulling them into the work
p309
aVand our assessing what works and what does not work.
p310
aVMost important, if a student has a sense of self,
p311
aVit is amazing how the dreams and the values
p312
aVcan make all the difference in the world.
p313
aa(lp314
VWhen I was a 12-year-old child in the jail in Birmingham,
p315
aVI kept thinking, "I wonder what my future could be."
p316
aVI had no idea that it was possible for this little black boy in Birmingham
p317
aVto one day be president of a university that has students from 150 countries,
p318
aVwhere students are not there just to survive,
p319
aVwhere they love learning, where they enjoy being the best,
p320
aVwhere they will one day change the world.
p321
aa(lp322
VAristotle said, "Excellence is never an accident.
p323
aVIt is the result of high intention, sincere effort and intelligent execution.
p324
aVIt represents the wisest option among many alternatives."
p325
aVAnd then he said something that gives me goosebumps.
p326
aVHe said, "Choice, not chance, determines your destiny."
p327
aVChoice, not chance, determines your destiny, dreams and values.
p328
aa(lp329
VThank you all very much.
