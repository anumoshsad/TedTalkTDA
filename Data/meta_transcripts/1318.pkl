VI was told to come here and tell you all stories,
p4
aVbut what I'd like to do is instead tell you why I'm suspicious of stories,
p5
aVwhy stories make me nervous.
p6
aVIn fact, the more inspired a story makes me feel,
p7
aVvery often, the more nervous I get.
p8
aV(Laughter)
p9
aVSo the best stories are often the trickiest ones.
p10
aVThe good and bad things about stories is that they are a kind of filter.
p11
aVThey take a lot of information, and they leave some of it out,
p12
aVand they keep some of it in.
p13
aVBut the thing about this filter is that it always leaves the same things in.
p14
aVYou're always left with the same few simple stories.
p15
aVThere is the old saying that just about every story
p16
aVcan be summed up as "a stranger came to town."
p17
aVThere is a book by Christopher Booker,
p18
aVwhere he claims there are really just seven types of stories.
p19
aVThere is monster, rags to riches, quest,
p20
aVvoyage and return, comedy, tragedy, rebirth.
p21
aVYou don't have to agree with that list exactly,
p22
aVbut the point is this: if you think in terms of stories,
p23
aVyou're telling yourself the same things over and over again.
p24
aVThere was a study done, we asked some people\u2014
p25
aVpeople were asked to describe their lives.
p26
aVWhen asked to describe their lives,
p27
aVwhat is interesting is how few people said "mess".
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aVIt's probably the best answer, I don't mean that in a bad way.
p30
aV"Mess" can be liberating, "mess" can be empowering,
p31
aV"mess" can be a way of drawing upon multiple strengths.
p32
aVBut what people wanted to say was, "My life is a journey."
p33
aV51% wanted to turn his or her life into a story.
p34
aV11% said, "My life is a battle." Again, that is a kind of story.
p35
aV8% said, "My life is a novel." 5% said, "My life is a play."
p36
aVI don't think anyone said, "My life is a reality TV show."
p37
aV(Laughter)
p38
aVBut again, we're imposing order on the mess we observe,
p39
aVand it's taking the same patterns,
p40
aVand the thing is when something is in the form of a story,
p41
aVoften, we remember it when we shouldn't.
p42
aVSo how many of you know the story
p43
aVabout George Washington and the cherry tree?
p44
aVIt's not obvious that is exactly what happened.
p45
aVThe story of Paul Revere, it's not obvious that that is exactly the way it happened.
p46
aVSo again, we should be suspicious of stories.
p47
aVWe're biologically programmed to respond to them.
p48
aVThey contain a lot of information. They have social power.
p49
aVThey connect us to other people.
p50
aVSo they are like a candy that we're fed
p51
aVwhen we consume political information, when we read novels.
p52
aVWhen we read non-fiction books, we're really being fed stories.
p53
aVNon-fiction is, in a sense, the new fiction.
p54
aVThe book may happen to say true things,
p55
aVbut again, everything's taking the same form of these stories.
p56
aVSo what are the problems of relying too heavily on stories?
p57
aVYou view your life like this
p58
aVinstead of the mess that it is or it ought to be.
p59
aVBut more specifically, I think of a few major problems
p60
aVwhen we think too much in terms of narrative.
p61
aVFirst, narratives tend to be too simple,
p62
aVfor the point of a narrative is to strip it away,
p63
aVnot just into 18 minutes,
p64
aVbut most narratives  you can present in a sentence or two.
p65
aVWhen you strip away detail,
p66
aVyou tend to tell stories in terms of good versus evil,
p67
aVwhether it's a story about your own life or a story about politics.
p68
aVI know some things actually are good versus evil, we all know this, right?
p69
aVBut I think, as a general rule,
p70
aVwe're too inclined to tell the good versus evil story.
p71
aVAs a simple rule of thumb,
p72
aVjust imagine that every time you're telling a good versus evil story,
p73
aVyou're basically lowering your IQ by ten points or more.
p74
aVIf you just adopt that as a kind of inner mental habit,
p75
aVit's, in my view, one way to get a lot smarter pretty quickly.
p76
aVYou don't have to read any books.
p77
aVJust imagine yourself pressing a button
p78
aVevery time you tell the good versus evil story,
p79
aVand by pressing that button,
p80
aVyou're lowering your IQ by ten points or more.
p81
aVAnother set of stories that are popular\u2014
p82
aVif you know Oliver Stone's movies, or Michael Moore's movies,
p83
aVyou can't make a movie and say: "It was all a big accident."
p84
aVNo, it has to be a conspiracy, people plotting together,
p85
aVbecause in a story, a story is about intention.
p86
aVA story is not about spontaneous order or complex human institutions
p87
aVwhich are the product of human action, but not of human design.
p88
aVNo, a story is about evil people plotting together.
p89
aVSo when you hear stories about plots,
p90
aVor even stories about good people plotting things together,
p91
aVjust like when you're watching movies,
p92
aVthis, again, is reason to be suspicious.
p93
aVAs a good rule of thumb, if you're asking:
p94
aV"When I hear a story, when should I be especially suspicious?"
p95
aVIf you hear a story and you think: "Wow, that would make a great movie!"
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aVThat's when the "uh-oh" reaction should pop in a bit more,
p98
aVand you should start thinking in terms
p99
aVof how the whole thing is maybe a bit of a mess.
p100
aVAnother common story or storyline is the claim that we "have to get tough".
p101
aVYou'll hear this in so many contexts.
p102
aVWe have to get tough with the banks. We had to get tough with the labor unions.
p103
aVWe need to get tough with some other country,
p104
aVsome foreign dictator, someone we're negotiating with.
p105
aVAgain, the point is not against getting tough.
p106
aVSometimes we should get tough.
p107
aVThat we got tough with the Nazis was a good thing.
p108
aVBut this is again a story we fall back upon all too readily, all too quickly.
p109
aVWhen we don't really know why something happened,
p110
aVwe blame someone, and we say: "We need to get tough with them!"
p111
aVAs if it had never occurred to your predecessor,
p112
aVthis idea of getting tough.
p113
aVI view it usually as a kind of mental laziness.
p114
aVIt's a simple story you tell: "We need to get tough,
p115
aVwe needed to get tough, we will have to get tough."
p116
aVUsually, that is a kind of warning signal.
p117
aVAnother kind of problem with stories is
p118
aVyou can only fit so many stories into your mind at once,
p119
aVor in the course of a day, or even over the course of a lifetime.
p120
aVSo your stories are serving too many purposes.
p121
aVFor instance, just to get out of bed in the morning,
p122
aVyou tell yourself the story
p123
aVthat your job is really important, what you're doing is really important
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aVand maybe it is, but I tell myself that story even when it's not.
p126
aVAnd you know what? That story works.
p127
aVIt gets me out of bed.
p128
aVIt's a kind of self-deception,
p129
aVbut the problem comes when I need to change that story.
p130
aVThe whole point of the story is that I grab onto it and I hold it,
p131
aVand it gets me out of bed.
p132
aVSo when I'm really doing something that is actually just a waste of time,
p133
aVin my mess of a life,
p134
aVI'm too tied into my story that got me out of bed,
p135
aVand ideally, I ought to have some very complex story map in my mind,
p136
aVyou know, with combinatorials and a matrix of computation, and the like,
p137
aVbut that is not how stories work.
p138
aVStories in order to work  have to be simple,
p139
aVeasily grasped, easily told to others, easily remembered.
p140
aVSo stories will serve dual and conflicting purposes,
p141
aVand very often they will lead us astray.
p142
aVI used to think I was within the camp of economists,
p143
aVI was one of the good guys, and I was allied with other good guys,
p144
aVand we were fighting the ideas of the bad guys.
p145
aVI used to think that!
p146
aVAnd probably, I was wrong.
p147
aVMaybe sometimes, I'm one of the good guys,
p148
aVbut on some issues, I finally realized: "Hey, I wasn't one of the good guys."
p149
aVI'm not sure I was the bad guy in the sense of having evil intent,
p150
aVbut it was very hard for me to get away with that story.
p151
aVOne interesting thing about cognitive biases
p152
aVis they are the subject of so many books these days.
p153
aVThere's the Nudge book, the Sway book, the Blink book,
p154
aVlike the one-title book,
p155
aVall about the ways in which we screw up.
p156
aVAnd there are so many ways,
p157
aVbut what I find interesting is that none of these books identify
p158
aVwhat, to me, is the single, central, most important way we screw up,
p159
aVand that is that we tell ourselves too many stories,
p160
aVor we are too easily seduced by stories.
p161
aVWhy don't these books tell us that?
p162
aVIt's because the books themselves are all about stories.
p163
aVThe more of these books you read, you're learning about some of your biases,
p164
aVbut you're making some of your other biases essentially worse.
p165
aVSo the books themselves are part of your cognitive bias.
p166
aVOften, people buy them as a kind of talisman, like:
p167
aV"I bought this book. I won't be 'Predictably Irrational'."
p168
aV(Laughter)
p169
aVIt's like people want to hear the worst,
p170
aVso psychologically, they can prepare for it or defend against it.
p171
aVIt's why there is such a market for pessimism.
p172
aVBut to think that by buying the book gets you somewhere,
p173
aVthat's maybe the bigger fallacy.
p174
aVIt's just like the evidence that shows that the most dangerous people
p175
aVare those who have been taught some financial literacy.
p176
aVThey're the ones who go out and make the worst mistakes.
p177
aVIt's the people who realize they don't know anything at all,
p178
aVthat end up doing pretty well.
p179
aVA third problem with stories
p180
aVis that outsiders manipulate us using stories,
p181
aVand we all like to think advertising only works on the other guy,
p182
aVbut, of course, that's not how it is, advertising works on all of us.
p183
aVSo if you're too attached to stories,
p184
aVwhat will happen is people selling products come along,
p185
aVand they will bundle their product with a story.
p186
aVYou're like, "Hey, a free story!"
p187
aVAnd you end up buying the product,
p188
aVbecause the product and the story go together.
p189
aV(Laugther)
p190
aVIf you think about how capitalism works,
p191
aVthere is a bias here.
p192
aVLet's consider two kinds of stories about cars.
p193
aVStory A is: "Buy this car,
p194
aVand you will have beautiful, romantic partners and a fascinating life."
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aVThere are a lot of people
p197
aVwho have a financial incentive to promote that story.
p198
aVBut, say, the alternative story is:
p199
aV"You don't actually need a car as nice as your income would indicate.
p200
aVWhat you usually do is look at what your peers do and copy them.
p201
aVThat is a good heuristic for lots of problems,
p202
aVbut when it comes to cars, just buy a Toyota."
p203
aV(Laughter)
p204
aVMaybe Toyota has an incentive there,
p205
aVbut even Toyota is making more money off the luxury cars,
p206
aVand less money off the cheaper cars.
p207
aVSo if you think which set of stories you end up hearing,
p208
aVyou end up hearing the glamor stories, the seductive stories,
p209
aVand again I'm telling you, don't trust them.
p210
aVThere are people using your love of stories to manipulate you.
p211
aVPull back and say:
p212
aV"What are the messages,
p213
aVwhat are the stories that no one has an incentive to tell?"
p214
aVStart telling yourself those, and then see if any of your decisions change.
p215
aVThat is one simple way.
p216
aVYou can never get out of the pattern of thinking in terms of stories,
p217
aVbut you can improve the extent to which you think in stories,
p218
aVand make some better decisions.
p219
aVSo if I'm thinking about this talk, I'm wondering, of course,
p220
aVwhat is it you take away from this talk?
p221
aVWhat story do you take away from Tyler Cowen?
p222
aVOne story you might be like the story of the quest.
p223
aV"Tyler was a man on a quest.
p224
aVTyler came here, and he told us not to think so much in terms of stories."
p225
aVThat would be a story you could tell about this talk.
p226
aV(Laughter)
p227
aVIt would fit a pretty well-known pattern.
p228
aVYou might remember it. You could tell it to other people.
p229
aV"This weird guy came, and he said,
p230
aV'Don't think in terms of stories. Let me tell you what happened today!'"
p231
aV(Laughter)
p232
aVAnd you tell your story.
p233
aV(Laugther)
p234
aVAnother possibility is you might tell a story of rebirth.
p235
aVYou might say, "I used to think too much in terms of stories
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aVbut then I heard Tyler Cowen
p238
aV(Laughter)
p239
aVand now I think less in terms of stories!"
p240
aVThat too is a narrative you will remember,
p241
aVyou can tell to other people, and again, it may stick.
p242
aVYou also could tell a story of deep tragedy.
p243
aV"This guy Tyler Cowen came
p244
aV(Laughter)
p245
aVand he told us not to think in terms of stories,
p246
aVbut all he could do was tell us stories
p247
aV(Laughter)
p248
aVabout how other people think too much in terms of stories."
p249
aV(Laughter)
p250
aVSo, today, which is it? Is it like quest, rebirth, tragedy?
p251
aVOr maybe some combination of the three?
p252
aVI'm really not sure, and I'm not here to tell you
p253
aVto burn your DVD player and throw out your Tolstoy.
p254
aVTo think in terms of stories is fundamentally human.
p255
aVThere is a Gabriel Garcia Marquez memoir "Living to Tell the Tale"
p256
aVthat we use memory in stories to make sense of what we've done,
p257
aVto give meaning to our lives, to establish connections with other people.
p258
aVNone of this will go away, should go away, or can go away.
p259
aVBut again, as an economist, I'm thinking about life on the margin,
p260
aVthe extra decision.
p261
aVShould we think more in terms of stories, or less in terms of stories?
p262
aVWhen we hear stories, should we be more suspicious?
p263
aVAnd what kind of stories should we be suspicious of?
p264
aVAgain, I'm telling you it's the stories, very often, that you like the most,
p265
aVthat you find the most rewarding, the most inspiring.
p266
aVThe stories that don't focus on opportunity cost,
p267
aVor the complex, unintended consequences of human action,
p268
aVbecause that very often does not make for a good story.
p269
aVSo often a story is a story of triumph, a story of struggle;
p270
aVthere are opposing forces, which are either evil or ignorant;
p271
aVthere is a person on a quest, someone making a voyage,
p272
aVand a stranger coming to town.
p273
aVAnd those are your categories, but don't let them make you too happy.
p274
aV(Laughter)
p275
aVAs an alternative,
p276
aVat the margin - again, no burning of Tolstoy -
p277
aVbut just be a little more messy.
p278
aVIf I actually had to live those journeys, and quests, and battles,
p279
aVthat would be so oppressive to me!
p280
aVIt's like, my goodness, can't I just have my life
p281
aVin its messy, ordinary  - I hesitate to use the word - glory
p282
aVbut that it's fun for me?
p283
aVDo I really have to follow some kind of narrative?
p284
aVCan't I just live?
p285
aVSo be more comfortable with messy.
p286
aVBe more comfortable with agnostic,
p287
aVand I mean this about the things that make you feel good.
p288
aVIt's so easy to pick out a few areas to be agnostic in,
p289
aVand then feel good about it,
p290
aVlike, "I am agnostic about religion, or politics."
p291
aVIt's a kind of portfolio move you make to be more dogmatic elsewhere, right?
p292
aV(Laughter)
p293
aVSometimes,
p294
aVthe most intellectually trustworthy people are the ones who pick one area,
p295
aVand they are totally dogmatic in that, so pig-headedly unreasonable,
p296
aVthat you think, "How can they possibly believe that?"
p297
aVBut it soaks up their stubbornness,
p298
aVand then, on other things, they can be pretty open-minded.
p299
aVSo don't fall into the trap of thinking because you're agnostic on some things,
p300
aVthat you're being fundamentally reasonable
p301
aVabout your self-deception, your stories, and your open-mindedness.
p302
aV(Laughter)
p303
aV[Think about] this idea of hovering, of epistemological hovering,
p304
aVand messiness, and incompleteness,
p305
aV[and how] not everything  ties up into a neat bow,
p306
aVand you're really not on a journey here.
p307
aVYou're here for some messy reason or reasons,
p308
aVand maybe you don't know what it is, and maybe I don't know what it is,
p309
aVbut anyway, I'm happy to be invited, and thank you all for listening.
