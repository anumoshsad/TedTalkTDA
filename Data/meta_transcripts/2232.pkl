VThis is a kindergarten we designed in 2007.
p4
aVWe made this kindergarten  to be a circle.
p5
aVIt's a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof.
p6
aVIf you are a parent,
p7
aVyou know that kids love to keep making circles.
p8
aVThis is how the rooftop looks.
p9
aa(lp10
VAnd why did we design this?
p11
aVThe principal of this kindergarten said,
p12
aV"No, I don't want a handrail."
p13
aVI said, "It's impossible."
p14
aVBut he insisted: "How about having a net sticking out from the edge of the roof?
p15
aVSo that it can catch the children falling off?"
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aVI said, "It's impossible."
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd of course, the government official said,
p20
aV"Of course you have to have a handrail."
p21
aVBut we could keep  that idea around the trees.
p22
aVThere are three trees popping through.
p23
aVAnd we were allowed to call  this rope as a handrail.
p24
aVBut of course, rope has nothing to do with them.
p25
aVThey fall into the net.
p26
aVAnd you get more,
p27
aVand more,
p28
aVmore.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVSometimes 40 children  are around a tree.
p31
aVThe boy on the branch,
p32
aVhe loves the tree so he is eating the tree.
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd at the time of an event,
p36
aVthey sit on the edge.
p37
aVIt looks so nice from underneath.
p38
aVMonkeys in the zoo.
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVFeeding time.
p41
aV(Laughter)  (Applause)
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd we made the roof as low as possible,
p44
aVbecause we wanted to see children on top of the roof,
p45
aVnot only underneath the roof.
p46
aVAnd if the roof is too high, you see only the ceiling.
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd the leg washing place \u2014 there are many kinds of water taps.
p49
aVYou see with the flexible tubes,
p50
aVyou want to spray water to your friends,
p51
aVand the shower,
p52
aVand the one in front is quite normal.
p53
aVBut if you look at this,
p54
aVthe boy is not washing his boots,
p55
aVhe's putting water into his boots.
p56
aV(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VThis kindergarten is completely open, most of the year.
p59
aVAnd there is no boundary between inside and outside.
p60
aVSo it means basically this architecture is a roof.
p61
aVAnd also there is no boundary between classrooms.
p62
aVSo there is no acoustic barrier at all.
p63
aVWhen you put many children in a quiet box,
p64
aVsome of them get really nervous.
p65
aVBut in this kindergarten,
p66
aVthere is no reason they get nervous.
p67
aVBecause there is no boundary.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd the principal says
p70
aVif the boy in the corner doesn't want to stay in the room,
p71
aVwe let him go.
p72
aVHe will come back eventually, because it's a circle, it comes back.
p73
aV(Laughter)
p74
aa(lp75
VBut the point is, in that kind of occasion,
p76
aVusually children try to hide somewhere.
p77
aVBut here, just they leave and come back.
p78
aVIt's a natural process.
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd secondly, we consider noise very important.
p81
aVYou know that children sleep better in noise.
p82
aVThey don't sleep in a quiet space.
p83
aVAnd in this kindergarten,
p84
aVthese children show amazing concentration in class.
p85
aVAnd you know, our kind grew up in the jungle with noise.
p86
aVThey need noise.
p87
aVAnd you know, you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar.
p88
aVYou are not supposed to be in silence.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd you know, these days
p91
aVwe are trying to make everything under control.
p92
aVYou know, it's completely open.
p93
aVAnd you should know that
p94
aVwe can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter.
p95
aVIn summer you go swimming.
p96
aVThe sand is 50 degrees.
p97
aVAnd also, you should know that you are waterproof.
p98
aVYou never melt in rain.
p99
aVSo, children are supposed to be outside.
p100
aVSo that is how we should treat them.
p101
aa(lp102
VThis is how they divide classrooms.
p103
aVThey are supposed to help teachers.
p104
aVThey don't.
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aVI didn't put him in.
p107
aVA classroom.
p108
aVAnd a washbasin.
p109
aVThey talk to each other around the well.
p110
aVAnd there are always  some trees in the classroom.
p111
aVA monkey trying to fish another monkey from above.
p112
aV(Laughter)
p113
aVMonkeys.
p114
aV(Laughter)
p115
aVAnd each classroom has at least one skylight.
p116
aVAnd this is where Santa Claus comes down at the time of Christmas.
p117
aa(lp118
VThis is the annex building,
p119
aVright next to that oval-shaped kindergarten.
p120
aVThe building is only five meters tall with seven floors.
p121
aVAnd of course, the ceiling height is very low.
p122
aVSo you have to consider safety.
p123
aVSo, we put our children, a daughter and a son.
p124
aVThey tried to go in.
p125
aVHe hit his head.
p126
aVHe's okay. His skull is quite strong.
p127
aVHe is resilient. It's my son.
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aVAnd he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off.
p130
aVAnd then we put other children.
p131
aa(lp132
VThe traffic jam is awful in Tokyo, as you know.
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVThe driver in front, she needs to learn how to drive.
p135
aVNow these days,
p136
aVkids need a small dosage of danger.
p137
aVAnd in this kind of occasion,
p138
aVthey learn to help each other.
p139
aVThis is society. This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days.
p140
aa(lp141
VNow, this drawing is showing the movement of a boy
p142
aVbetween 9:10 and 9:30.
p143
aVAnd the circumference of this building is 183 meters.
p144
aVSo it's not exactly small at all.
p145
aVAnd this boy did 6,000 meters in the morning.
p146
aVBut the surprise is yet to come.
p147
aVThe children in this kindergarten do 4,000 meters on average.
p148
aVAnd these children have the highest athletic abilities
p149
aVamong many kindergartens.
p150
aVThe principal says,
p151
aV"I don't train them. We leave them on top of the roof.
p152
aVJust like sheep."
p153
aV(Laughter)
p154
aVThey keep running.
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aa(lp157
VMy point is don't control them,
p158
aVdon't protect them too much,
p159
aVand they need to tumble sometimes.
p160
aVThey need to get some injury.
p161
aVAnd that makes them learn
p162
aVhow to live in this world.
p163
aVI think architecture is capable of changing this world,
p164
aVand people's lives.
p165
aVAnd this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children.
p166
aa(lp167
VThank you very much.
