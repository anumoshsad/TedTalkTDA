VSo anyway, who am I?
p4
aVI usually say to people, when they say, "What do you do?"
p5
aVI say, "I do hardware,"
p6
aVbecause it sort of conveniently encompasses everything I do.
p7
aVAnd I recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some
p8
aVValley event, to which he replied, "How quaint."
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VAnd I sort of really was dumbstruck.
p13
aVAnd I really should have said something smart.
p14
aVAnd now I've had a little bit of time to think about it,
p15
aVI would have said, "Well, you know,
p16
aVif we look at the next 100 years
p17
aVand we've seen all these problems in the last few days,
p18
aVmost of the big issues \u2014 clean water, clean energy \u2014
p19
aVand they're interchangeable in some respects \u2014
p20
aVand cleaner, more functional materials \u2014
p21
aVthey all look to me to be hardware problems.
p22
aVThis doesn't mean we should ignore software,
p23
aVor information, or computation."
p24
aVAnd that's in fact probably what I'm going to try and tell you about.
p25
aa(lp26
VSo, this talk is going to be about how do we make things
p27
aVand what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future.
p28
aVNow, TED sends you a lot of spam if you're a speaker
p29
aVabout "do this, do that" and you fill out all these forms,
p30
aVand you don't actually know how they're going to describe you,
p31
aVand it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist.
p32
aVAnd I've always been nervous about the term "futurist,"
p33
aVbecause you seem doomed to failure because you can't really predict it.
p34
aVAnd I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have,
p35
aVand said, "You know, well, if I have to talk about the future, what is it?"
p36
aVAnd George Homsey, a great guy, said, "Oh, the future is amazing.
p37
aVIt is so much stranger than you think.
p38
aVWe're going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut,
p39
aVand we're going to make your poo smell like peppermint."
p40
aa(lp41
V(Laughter)
p42
aa(lp43
VSo, you may think that's sort of really crazy,
p44
aVbut there are some pretty amazing things that are happening
p45
aVthat make this possible.
p46
aVSo, this isn't my work, but it's work of good friends of mine at MIT.
p47
aVThis is called the registry of standard biological parts.
p48
aVThis is headed by Drew Endy and Tom Knight
p49
aVand a few other very, very bright individuals.
p50
aVBasically, what they're doing is looking at biology as a programmable system.
p51
aVLiterally, think of proteins as subroutines
p52
aVthat you can string together to execute a program.
p53
aVNow, this is actually becoming such an interesting idea.
p54
aVThis is a state diagram. That's an extremely simple computer.
p55
aa(lp56
VThis one is a two-bit counter.
p57
aVSo that's essentially the computational equivalent of two light switches.
p58
aVAnd this is being built by a group of students at Zurich
p59
aVfor a design competition in biology.
p60
aVAnd from the results of the same competition last year,
p61
aVa University of Texas team of students programmed bacteria
p62
aVso that they can detect light and switch on and off.
p63
aVSo this is interesting in the sense that you can now
p64
aVdo "if-then-for" statements in materials, in structure.
p65
aVThis is a pretty interesting trend,
p66
aVbecause we used to live in a world where everyone's said glibly,
p67
aV"Form follows function," but I think I've sort of grown up in a world
p68
aV\u2014 you listened to Neil Gershenfeld yesterday;
p69
aVI was in a lab associated with his \u2014 where it's really a world
p70
aVwhere information defines form and function.
p71
aa(lp72
VI spent six years thinking about that,
p73
aVbut to show you the power of art over science \u2014
p74
aVthis is actually one of the cartoons I write. These are called "HowToons."
p75
aVI work with a fabulous illustrator called Nick Dragotta.
p76
aVTook me six years at MIT,
p77
aVand about that many pages to describe what I was doing,
p78
aVand it took him one page. And so this is our muse Tucker.
p79
aVHe's an interesting little kid \u2014 and his sister, Celine \u2014
p80
aVand what he's doing here
p81
aVis observing the self-assembly of his Cheerios in his cereal bowl.
p82
aVAnd in fact you can program the self-assembly of things,
p83
aVso he starts chocolate-dipping edges,
p84
aVchanging the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity.
p85
aVIn theory, if you program those sufficiently,
p86
aVyou should be able to do something pretty interesting
p87
aVand make a very complex structure.
p88
aVIn this case, he's done self-replication of a complex 3D structure.
p89
aVAnd that's what I thought about for a long time,
p90
aVbecause this is how we currently make things.
p91
aVThis is a silicon wafer, and essentially
p92
aVthat's just a whole bunch of layers of two-dimensional stuff, sort of layered up.
p93
aVThe feature side is \u2014 you know, people will say,
p94
aV[unclear] down around about 65 nanometers now.
p95
aa(lp96
VOn the right, that's a radiolara.
p97
aVThat's a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans.
p98
aVAnd that has feature sizes down to about 20 nanometers,
p99
aVand it's a complex 3D structure.
p100
aVWe could do a lot more with computers and things generally
p101
aVif we knew how to build things this way.
p102
aVThe secret to biology is, it builds computation
p103
aVinto the way it makes things. So this little thing here, polymerase,
p104
aVis essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating DNA.
p105
aVAnd the ribosome here is another little computer
p106
aVthat helps in the translation of the proteins.
p107
aVI thought about this
p108
aVin the sense that it's great to build in biological materials,
p109
aVbut can we do similar things?
p110
aVCan we get self-replicating-type behavior?
p111
aVCan we get complex 3D structure automatically assembling
p112
aVin inorganic systems?
p113
aVBecause there are some advantages to inorganic systems,
p114
aVlike higher speed semiconductors, etc.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo, this is some of my work
p117
aVon how do you do an autonomously self-replicating system.
p118
aVAnd this is sort of Babbage's revenge.
p119
aVThese are little mechanical computers.
p120
aVThese are five-state state machines.
p121
aVSo, that's about three light switches lined up.
p122
aVIn a neutral state, they won't bind at all.
p123
aVNow, if I make a string of these, a bit string,
p124
aVthey will be able to replicate.
p125
aVSo we start with white, blue, blue, white.
p126
aVThat encodes; that will now copy. From one comes two,
p127
aVand then from two comes three.
p128
aVAnd so you've got this sort of replicating system.
p129
aVIt was work actually by Lionel Penrose,
p130
aVfather of Roger Penrose, the tiles guy.
p131
aVHe did a lot of this work in the '60s,
p132
aVand so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow
p133
aVas we went down the digital computer revolution, but it's now coming back.
p134
aa(lp135
VSo now I'm going to show you the hands-free, autonomous self-replication.
p136
aVSo we've tracked in the video the input string,
p137
aVwhich was green, green, yellow, yellow, green.
p138
aVWe set them off on this air hockey table.
p139
aVYou know, high science uses air hockey tables \u2014
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
V\u2014 and if you watch this thing long enough you get dizzy,
p144
aVbut what you're actually seeing is copies of that original string
p145
aVemerging from the parts bin that you have here.
p146
aVSo we've got autonomous replication of bit strings.
p147
aVSo, why would you want to replicate bit strings?
p148
aVWell, it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme,
p149
aVthat you can take a linear string, which is a convenient thing to copy,
p150
aVand you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3D structure.
p151
aVSo I was trying to, you know, take the engineer's version:
p152
aVCan we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials
p153
aVthat will do the same thing?
p154
aa(lp155
VSo what I'm showing you here is that we can make a 2D shape \u2014
p156
aVthe B \u2014 assemble from a string of components
p157
aVthat follow extremely simple rules.
p158
aVAnd the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here,
p159
aVand the incredibly simple state machines in the previous design,
p160
aVwas that you don't need digital logic to do computation.
p161
aVAnd that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips.
p162
aVSo you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo, Neil Gershenfeld showed you this video on Wednesday, I believe,
p165
aVbut I'll show you again.
p166
aVThis is literally the colored sequence of those tiles.
p167
aVEach different color has a different magnetic polarity,
p168
aVand the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out.
p169
aVNow, hopefully, those of you who know anything about graph theory
p170
aVcan look at that, and that will satisfy you
p171
aVthat that can also do arbitrary 3D structure,
p172
aVand in fact, you know, I can now take a dog, carve it up
p173
aVand then reassemble it so it's a linear string
p174
aVthat will fold from a sequence. And now
p175
aVI can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits.
p176
aVSo, you know, it's a pretty interesting world
p177
aVwhen you start looking at the world a little bit differently.
p178
aVAnd the universe is now a compiler.
p179
aVAnd so I'm thinking about, you know, what are the programs
p180
aVfor programming the physical universe?
p181
aVAnd how do we think about materials and structure,
p182
aVsort of as an information and computation problem?
p183
aVNot just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point,
p184
aVbut that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic, are the computers.
p185
aa(lp186
VHaving totally absorbed this philosophy,
p187
aVI started looking at a lot of problems a little differently.
p188
aVWith the universe as a computer,
p189
aVyou can look at this droplet of water
p190
aVas having performed the computations.
p191
aVYou set a couple of boundary conditions, like gravity,
p192
aVthe surface tension, density, etc., and then you press "execute,"
p193
aVand magically, the universe produces you a perfect ball lens.
p194
aVSo, this actually applied to the problem
p195
aVof \u2014 so there's a half a billion to a billion people in the world
p196
aVdon't have access to cheap eyeglasses.
p197
aVSo can you make a machine
p198
aVthat could make any prescription lens very quickly on site?
p199
aVThis is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition.
p200
aVIf it's circular, you make a spherical lens.
p201
aVIf it's elliptical, you can make an astigmatic lens.
p202
aVYou then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure \u2014
p203
aVso that's part of the extra program.
p204
aVAnd literally with only those two inputs \u2014
p205
aVso, the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure \u2014
p206
aVyou can define an infinite number of lenses
p207
aVthat cover the range of human refractive error,
p208
aVfrom minus 12 to plus eight diopters, up to four diopters of cylinder.
p209
aVAnd then literally, you now pour on a monomer.
p210
aVYou know, I'll do a Julia Childs here.
p211
aVThis is three minutes of UV light.
p212
aVAnd you reverse the pressure on your membrane
p213
aVonce you've cooked it. Pop it out.
p214
aVI've seen this video, but I still don't know if it's going to end right.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VSo you reverse this. This is a very old movie,
p219
aVso with the new prototypes, actually both surfaces are flexible,
p220
aVbut this will show you the point.
p221
aVNow you've finished the lens, you literally pop it out.
p222
aVThat's next year's Yves Klein, you know, eyeglasses shape.
p223
aVAnd you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters.
p224
aVAnd as I rotate it against this side shot, you'll see that that has cylinder,
p225
aVand that was programmed in \u2014
p226
aVliterally into the physics of the system.
p227
aVSo, this sort of thinking about structure as computation
p228
aVand structure as information leads to other things, like this.
p229
aa(lp230
VThis is something that my people at SQUID Labs
p231
aVare working on at the moment, called "electronic rope."
p232
aVSo literally, you think about a rope. It has very complex structure in the weave.
p233
aVAnd under no load, it's one structure.
p234
aVUnder a different load, it's a different structure. And you can actually exploit that
p235
aVby putting in a very small number of
p236
aVconducting fibers to actually make it a sensor.
p237
aVSo this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope
p238
aVat any particular point in the rope.
p239
aVJust by thinking about the physics of the world,
p240
aVmaterials as the computer,
p241
aVyou can start to do things like this.
p242
aa(lp243
VI'm going to segue a little here.
p244
aVI guess I'm just going to casually tell you the types of things
p245
aVthat I think about with this.
p246
aVOne thing I'm really interested about this right now is, how,
p247
aVif you're really taking this view of the universe as a computer,
p248
aVhow do we make things in a very general sense,
p249
aVand how might we share the way we make things in a general sense
p250
aVthe same way you share open source hardware?
p251
aVAnd a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits
p252
aVof having lots of people look at problems,
p253
aVshare the information and work on those things together.
p254
aVSo, a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time,
p255
aVand unless Lisa Randall changes that,
p256
aVwe'll continue to move in linear time.
p257
aVSo that means anything you do, or anything you make,
p258
aVyou produce a sequence of steps \u2014
p259
aVand I think Lego in the '70s nailed this,
p260
aVand they did it most elegantly.
p261
aVBut they can show you how to build things in sequence.
p262
aVSo, I'm thinking about, how can we generalize
p263
aVthe way we make all sorts of things,
p264
aVso you end up with this sort of guy, right?
p265
aVAnd I think this applies across a very broad \u2014 sort of, a lot of concepts.
p266
aa(lp267
VYou know, Cameron Sinclair yesterday said,
p268
aV"How do I get everyone to collaborate on design
p269
aVglobally to do housing for humanity?"
p270
aVAnd if you've seen Amy Smith,
p271
aVshe talks about how you get students at MIT
p272
aVto work with communities in Haiti.
p273
aVAnd I think we have to sort of redefine and rethink
p274
aVhow we define structure and materials and assembly things,
p275
aVso that we can really share the information
p276
aVon how you do those things in a more profound way
p277
aVand build on each other's source code for structure.
p278
aVI don't know exactly how to do this yet,
p279
aVbut, you know, it's something being actively thought about.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo, you know, that leads to questions
p282
aVlike, is this a compiler? Is this a sub-routine?
p283
aVInteresting things like that.
p284
aVMaybe I'm getting a little too abstract, but you know,
p285
aVthis is the sort of \u2014 returning to our comic characters \u2014
p286
aVthis is sort of the universe, or a different universe view,
p287
aVthat I think is going to be very prevalent in the future \u2014
p288
aVfrom biotech to materials assembly. It was great to hear Bill Joy.
p289
aVThey're starting to invest in materials science,
p290
aVbut these are the new things in materials science.
p291
aVHow do we put real information and real structure into new ideas,
p292
aVand see the world in a different way? And it's not going to be binary code
p293
aVthat defines the computers of the universe \u2014
p294
aVit's sort of an analog computer.
p295
aVBut it's definitely an interesting new worldview.
p296
aa(lp297
VI've gone too far. So that sounds like it's it.
p298
aVI've probably got a couple of minutes of questions,
p299
aVor I can show \u2014 I think they also said that I do extreme stuff
p300
aVin the introduction, so I may have to explain that.
p301
aVSo maybe I'll do that with this short video.
p302
aa(lp303
VSo this is actually a 3,000-square-foot kite,
p304
aVwhich also happens to be a minimal energy surface.
p305
aVSo returning to the droplet, again,
p306
aVthinking about the universe in a new way.
p307
aVThis is a kite designed by a guy called Dave Kulp.
p308
aVAnd why do you want a 3,000-square-foot kite?
p309
aVSo that's a kite the size of your house.
p310
aVAnd so you want that to tow boats very fast.
p311
aVSo I've been working on this a little, also,
p312
aVwith a couple of other guys.
p313
aVBut, you know, this is another way to look at the \u2014
p314
aVif you abstract again,
p315
aVthis is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe.
p316
aVYou could just hang it as a bed sheet,
p317
aVbut again, the computation of all the physics
p318
aVgives you the aerodynamic shape.
p319
aVAnd so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed
p320
aVwith systems like that. So that's sort of another interesting aspect of the future.
