VImagine that you're a pig farmer.
p4
aVYou live on a small farm in the Philippines.
p5
aVYour animals are your family's sole source of income \u2014
p6
aVas long as they're healthy.
p7
aVYou know that any day,
p8
aVone of your pigs can catch the flu,
p9
aVthe swine flu.
p10
aVLiving in tight quarters, one pig coughing and sneezing
p11
aVmay soon lead to the next pig coughing and sneezing,
p12
aVuntil an outbreak of swine flu has taken over your farm.
p13
aVIf it's a bad enough virus,
p14
aVthe health of your herd may be gone in the blink of an eye.
p15
aVIf you called in a veterinarian,
p16
aVhe or she would visit your farm and take samples
p17
aVfrom your pigs' noses and mouths.
p18
aVBut then they would have to drive back into the city
p19
aVto test those samples in their central lab.
p20
aVTwo weeks later, you'd hear back the results.
p21
aVTwo weeks may be just enough time for infection to spread
p22
aVand take away your way of life.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut it doesn't have to be that way.
p25
aVToday, farmers can take those samples themselves.
p26
aVThey can jump right into the pen and swab their pigs' noses and mouths
p27
aVwith a little filter paper,
p28
aVplace that little filter paper in a tiny tube,
p29
aVand mix it with some chemicals that will extract genetic material
p30
aVfrom their pigs' noses and mouths.
p31
aVAnd without leaving their farms,
p32
aVthey take a drop of that genetic material
p33
aVand put it into a little analyzer smaller than a shoebox,
p34
aVprogram it to detect DNA or RNA from the swine flu virus,
p35
aVand within one hour get back the results, visualize the results.
p36
aVThis reality is possible
p37
aVbecause today we're living in the era of personal DNA technology.
p38
aVEvery one of us can actually test DNA ourselves.
p39
aa(lp40
VDNA is the fundamental molecule the carries genetic instructions
p41
aVthat help build the living world.
p42
aVHumans have DNA.
p43
aVPigs have DNA.
p44
aVEven bacteria and some viruses have DNA too.
p45
aVThe genetic instructions encoded in DNA inform how our bodies develop,
p46
aVgrow, function.
p47
aVAnd in many cases, that same information can trigger disease.
p48
aVYour genetic information
p49
aVis strung into a long and twisted molecule, the DNA double helix,
p50
aVthat has over three billion letters,
p51
aVbeginning to end.
p52
aVBut the lines that carry meaningful information
p53
aVare usually very short \u2014
p54
aVa few dozen to several thousand letters long.
p55
aVSo when we're looking to answer a question based on DNA,
p56
aVwe actually don't need to read
p57
aVall those three billion letters, typically.
p58
aVThat would be like getting hungry at night
p59
aVand having to flip through the whole phone book
p60
aVfrom cover to cover,
p61
aVpausing at every line,
p62
aVjust to find the nearest pizza joint.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VLuckily, three decades ago,
p67
aVhumans started to invent tools
p68
aVthat can find any specific line of genetic information.
p69
aVThese DNA machines are wonderful.
p70
aVThey can find any line in DNA.
p71
aVBut once they find it,
p72
aVthat DNA is still tiny, and surrounded by so much other DNA,
p73
aVthat what these machines then do is copy the target gene,
p74
aVand one copy piles on top of another,
p75
aVmillions and millions and millions of copies,
p76
aVuntil that gene stands out against the rest;
p77
aVuntil we can visualize it,
p78
aVinterpret it, read it, understand it,
p79
aVuntil we can answer:
p80
aVDoes my pig have the flu?
p81
aVOr other questions buried in our own DNA:
p82
aVAm I at risk of cancer?
p83
aVAm I of Irish descent?
p84
aVIs that child my son?
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VThis ability to make copies of DNA, as simple as it sounds,
p89
aVhas transformed our world.
p90
aVScientists use it every day to detect and address disease,
p91
aVto create innovative medicines,
p92
aVto modify foods,
p93
aVto assess whether our food is safe to eat
p94
aVor whether it's contaminated with deadly bacteria.
p95
aVEven judges use the output of these machines in court
p96
aVto decide whether someone is innocent or guilty based on DNA evidence.
p97
aVThe inventor of this DNA-copying technique
p98
aVwas awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993.
p99
aVBut for 30 years,
p100
aVthe power of genetic analysis has been confined to the ivory tower,
p101
aVor bigwig PhD scientist work.
p102
aVWell, several companies around the world
p103
aVare working on making this same technology accessible
p104
aVto everyday people like the pig farmer,
p105
aVlike you.
p106
aa(lp107
VI cofounded one of these companies.
p108
aVThree years ago,
p109
aVtogether with a fellow biologist and friend of mine,
p110
aVZeke Alvarez Saavedra,
p111
aVwe decided to make personal DNA machines
p112
aVthat anyone could use.
p113
aVOur goal was to bring DNA science to more people in new places.
p114
aVWe started working in our basements.
p115
aVWe had a simple question:
p116
aVWhat could the world look like
p117
aVif everyone could analyze DNA?
p118
aVWe were curious,
p119
aVas curious as you would have been if I had shown you this picture in 1980.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VYou would have thought, "Wow!
p124
aVI can now call my Aunt Glenda from the car
p125
aVand wish her a happy birthday.
p126
aVI can call anyone, anytime.
p127
aVThis is the future!"
p128
aVLittle did you know,
p129
aVyou would tap on that phone to make dinner reservations
p130
aVfor you and Aunt Glenda to celebrate together.
p131
aVWith another tap, you'd be ordering her gift.
p132
aVAnd yet one more tap,
p133
aVand you'd be "liking" Auntie Glenda on Facebook.
p134
aVAnd all of this, while sitting on the toilet.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VIt is notoriously hard to predict where new technology might take us.
p139
aVAnd the same is true for personal DNA technology today.
p140
aa(lp141
VFor example, I could never have imagined
p142
aVthat a truffle farmer, of all people,
p143
aVwould use personal DNA machines.
p144
aVDr. Paul Thomas grows truffles for a living.
p145
aVWe see him pictured here,
p146
aVholding the first UK-cultivated truffle in his hands, on one of his farms.
p147
aVTruffles are this delicacy
p148
aVthat stems from a fungus growing on the roots of living trees.
p149
aVAnd it's a rare fungus.
p150
aVSome species may fetch 3,000, 7,000, or more dollars per kilogram.
p151
aVI learned from Paul
p152
aVthat the stakes for a truffle farmer can be really high.
p153
aVWhen he sources new truffles to grow on his farms,
p154
aVhe's exposed to the threat of knockoffs \u2014
p155
aVtruffles that look and feel like the real thing,
p156
aVbut they're of lower quality.
p157
aVBut even to a trained eye like Paul's,
p158
aVeven when looked at under a microscope,
p159
aVthese truffles can pass for authentic.
p160
aVSo in order to grow the highest quality truffles,
p161
aVthe ones that chefs all over the world will fight over,
p162
aVPaul has to use DNA analysis.
p163
aVIsn't that mind-blowing?
p164
aVI bet you will never look at that black truffle risotto again
p165
aVwithout thinking of its genes.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VBut personal DNA machines can also save human lives.
p170
aVProfessor Ian Goodfellow is a virologist at the University of Cambridge.
p171
aVLast year he traveled to Sierra Leone.
p172
aVWhen the Ebola outbreak broke out in Western Africa,
p173
aVhe quickly realized that doctors there lacked the basic tools
p174
aVto detect and combat disease.
p175
aVResults could take up to a week to come back \u2014
p176
aVthat's way too long for the patients and the families who are suffering.
p177
aVIan decided to move his lab into Makeni, Sierra Leone.
p178
aVHere we see Ian Goodfellow
p179
aVmoving over 10 tons of equipment into a pop-up tent
p180
aVthat he would equip to detect and diagnose the virus
p181
aVand sequence it within 24 hours.
p182
aVBut here's a surprise:
p183
aVthe same equipment that Ian could use at his lab in the UK
p184
aVto sequence and diagnose Ebola,
p185
aVjust wouldn't work under these conditions.
p186
aVWe're talking 35 Celsius heat and over 90 percent humidity here.
p187
aVBut instead, Ian could use personal DNA machines
p188
aVsmall enough to be placed in front of the air-conditioning unit
p189
aVto keep sequencing the virus
p190
aVand keep saving lives.
p191
aa(lp192
VThis may seem like an extreme place for DNA analysis,
p193
aVbut let's move on to an even more extreme environment:
p194
aVouter space.
p195
aVLet's talk about DNA analysis in space.
p196
aVWhen astronauts live aboard the International Space Station,
p197
aVthey're orbiting the planet 250 miles high.
p198
aVThey're traveling at 17,000 miles per hour.
p199
aVPicture that \u2014
p200
aVyou're seeing 15 sunsets and sunrises every day.
p201
aVYou're also living in microgravity,
p202
aVfloating.
p203
aVAnd under these conditions, our bodies can do funky things.
p204
aVOne of these things is that our immune systems get suppressed,
p205
aVmaking astronauts more prone to infection.
p206
aa(lp207
VA 16-year-old girl,
p208
aVa high school student from New York, Anna-Sophia Boguraev,
p209
aVwondered whether changes to the DNA of astronauts
p210
aVcould be related to this immune suppression,
p211
aVand through a science competition called "Genes In Space,"
p212
aVAnna-Sophia designed an experiment to test this hypothesis
p213
aVusing a personal DNA machine aboard the International Space Station.
p214
aVHere we see Anna-Sophia on April 8, 2016, in Cape Canaveral,
p215
aVwatching her experiment launch to the International Space Station.
p216
aVThat cloud of smoke is the rocket
p217
aVthat brought Anna-Sophia's experiment to the International Space Station,
p218
aVwhere, three days later,
p219
aVastronaut Tim Peake carried out her experiment \u2014
p220
aVin microgravity.
p221
aVPersonal DNA machines are now aboard the International Space Station,
p222
aVwhere they can help monitor living conditions
p223
aVand protect the lives of astronauts.
p224
aa(lp225
VA 16-year-old designing a DNA experiment
p226
aVto protect the lives of astronauts
p227
aVmay seem like a rarity, the mark of a child genius.
p228
aVWell, to me, it signals something bigger:
p229
aVthat DNA technology is finally within the reach of every one of you.
p230
aa(lp231
VA few years ago,
p232
aVa college student armed with a personal computer
p233
aVcould code an app,
p234
aVan app that is now a social network with more than one billion users.
p235
aVCould we be moving into a world
p236
aVof one personal DNA machine in every home?
p237
aa(lp238
VI know families who are already living in this reality.
p239
aVThe Daniels family, for example,
p240
aVset up a DNA lab in the basement of their suburban Chicago home.
p241
aVThis is not a family made of PhD scientists.
p242
aVThis is a family like any other.
p243
aVThey just like to spend time together doing fun, creative things.
p244
aVBy day, Brian is an executive at a private equity firm.
p245
aVAt night and on weekends, he experiments with DNA
p246
aValongside his kids, ages seven and nine,
p247
aVas a way to explore the living world.
p248
aVLast time I called them,
p249
aVthey were checking out homegrown produce from the backyard garden.
p250
aVThey were testing tomatoes that they had picked,
p251
aVtaking the flesh of their skin, putting it in a test tube,
p252
aVmixing it with chemicals to extract DNA
p253
aVand then using their home DNA copier
p254
aVto test those tomatoes for genetically engineered traits.
p255
aa(lp256
VFor the Daniels family,
p257
aVthe personal DNA machine is like the chemistry set
p258
aVfor the 21st century.
p259
aVMost of us may not yet be diagnosing genetic conditions
p260
aVin our kitchen sinks
p261
aVor doing at-home paternity testing.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Laughter)
p264
aa(lp265
VBut we've definitely reached a point in history
p266
aVwhere every one of you could actually get hands-on with DNA
p267
aVin your kitchen.
p268
aVYou could copy, paste and analyze DNA
p269
aVand extract meaningful information from it.
p270
aVAnd it's at times like this that profound transformation
p271
aVis bound to happen;
p272
aVmoments when a transformative, powerful technology
p273
aVthat was before limited to a select few in the ivory tower,
p274
aVfinally becomes within the reach of every one of us,
p275
aVfrom farmers to schoolchildren.
p276
aVThink about the moment
p277
aVwhen phones stopped being plugged into the wall by cords,
p278
aVor when computers left the mainframe
p279
aVand entered your home or your office.
p280
aa(lp281
VThe ripples of the personal DNA revolution
p282
aVmay be hard to predict,
p283
aVbut one thing is certain:
p284
aVrevolutions don't go backwards,
p285
aVand DNA technology is already spreading faster than our imagination.
p286
aa(lp287
VSo if you're curious,
p288
aVget up close and personal with DNA \u2014 today.
p289
aVIt is in our DNA to be curious.
p290
