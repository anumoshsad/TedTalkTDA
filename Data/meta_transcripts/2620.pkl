VHi.
p4
aVI want to talk about understanding, and the nature of understanding,
p5
aVand what the essence of understanding is,
p6
aVbecause understanding is something we aim for, everyone.
p7
aVWe want to understand things.
p8
aVMy claim is that understanding has to do
p9
aVwith the ability to change your perspective.
p10
aVIf you don't have that, you don't have understanding.
p11
aVSo that is my claim.
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd I want to focus on mathematics.
p14
aVMany of us think of mathematics as addition, subtraction,
p15
aVmultiplication, division,
p16
aVfractions, percent, geometry, algebra \u2014 all that stuff.
p17
aVBut actually, I want to talk about the essence of mathematics as well.
p18
aVAnd my claim is that mathematics has to do with patterns.
p19
aa(lp20
VBehind me, you see a beautiful pattern,
p21
aVand this pattern actually emerges just from drawing circles
p22
aVin a very particular way.
p23
aVSo my day-to-day definition of mathematics that I use every day
p24
aVis the following:
p25
aVFirst of all, it's about finding patterns.
p26
aVAnd by "pattern," I mean a connection, a structure, some regularity,
p27
aVsome rules that govern what we see.
p28
aVSecond of all,
p29
aVI think it is about representing these patterns with a language.
p30
aVWe make up language if we don't have it,
p31
aVand in mathematics, this is essential.
p32
aVIt's also about making assumptions
p33
aVand playing around with these assumptions and just seeing what happens.
p34
aVWe're going to do that very soon.
p35
aVAnd finally, it's about doing cool stuff.
p36
aVMathematics enables us to do so many things.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo let's have a look at these patterns.
p39
aVIf you want to tie a tie knot,
p40
aVthere are patterns.
p41
aVTie knots have names.
p42
aVAnd you can also do the mathematics of tie knots.
p43
aVThis is a left-out, right-in, center-out and tie.
p44
aVThis is a left-in, right-out, left-in, center-out and tie.
p45
aVThis is a language we made up for the patterns of tie knots,
p46
aVand a half-Windsor is all that.
p47
aVThis is a mathematics book about tying shoelaces
p48
aVat the university level,
p49
aVbecause there are patterns in shoelaces.
p50
aVYou can do it in so many different ways.
p51
aVWe can analyze it.
p52
aVWe can make up languages for it.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd representations are all over mathematics.
p55
aVThis is Leibniz's notation from 1675.
p56
aVHe invented a language for patterns in nature.
p57
aVWhen we throw something up in the air,
p58
aVit falls down.
p59
aVWhy?
p60
aVWe're not sure, but we can represent this with mathematics in a pattern.
p61
aa(lp62
VThis is also a pattern.
p63
aVThis is also an invented language.
p64
aVCan you guess for what?
p65
aVIt is actually a notation system for dancing, for tap dancing.
p66
aVThat enables him as a choreographer to do cool stuff, to do new things,
p67
aVbecause he has represented it.
p68
aa(lp69
VI want you to think about how amazing representing something actually is.
p70
aVHere it says the word "mathematics."
p71
aVBut actually, they're just dots, right?
p72
aVSo how in the world can these dots represent the word?
p73
aVWell, they do.
p74
aVThey represent the word "mathematics,"
p75
aVand these symbols also represent that word
p76
aVand this we can listen to.
p77
aVIt sounds like this.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Beeps)
p80
aa(lp81
VSomehow these sounds represent the word and the concept.
p82
aVHow does this happen?
p83
aVThere's something amazing going on about representing stuff.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo I want to talk about that magic that happens
p86
aVwhen we actually represent something.
p87
aVHere you see just lines with different widths.
p88
aVThey stand for numbers for a particular book.
p89
aVAnd I can actually recommend this book, it's a very nice book.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VJust trust me.
p94
aa(lp95
VOK, so let's just do an experiment,
p96
aVjust to play around with some straight lines.
p97
aVThis is a straight line.
p98
aVLet's make another one.
p99
aVSo every time we move, we move one down and one across,
p100
aVand we draw a new straight line, right?
p101
aVWe do this over and over and over,
p102
aVand we look for patterns.
p103
aVSo this pattern emerges,
p104
aVand it's a rather nice pattern.
p105
aVIt looks like a curve, right?
p106
aVJust from drawing simple, straight lines.
p107
aa(lp108
VNow I can change my perspective a little bit. I can rotate it.
p109
aVHave a look at the curve.
p110
aVWhat does it look like?
p111
aVIs it a part of a circle?
p112
aVIt's actually not a part of a circle.
p113
aVSo I have to continue my investigation and look for the true pattern.
p114
aVPerhaps if I copy it and make some art?
p115
aVWell, no.
p116
aVPerhaps I should extend the lines like this,
p117
aVand look for the pattern there.
p118
aVLet's make more lines.
p119
aVWe do this.
p120
aVAnd then let's zoom out and change our perspective again.
p121
aVThen we can actually see that what started out as just straight lines
p122
aVis actually a curve called a parabola.
p123
aVThis is represented by a simple equation,
p124
aVand it's a beautiful pattern.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo this is the stuff that we do.
p127
aVWe find patterns, and we represent them.
p128
aVAnd I think this is a nice day-to-day definition.
p129
aVBut today I want to go a little bit deeper,
p130
aVand think about what the nature of this is.
p131
aVWhat makes it possible?
p132
aVThere's one thing that's a little bit deeper,
p133
aVand that has to do with the ability to change your perspective.
p134
aVAnd I claim that when you change your perspective,
p135
aVand if you take another point of view,
p136
aVyou learn something new about what you are watching
p137
aVor looking at or hearing.
p138
aVAnd I think this is a really important thing that we do all the time.
p139
aa(lp140
VSo let's just look at this simple equation,
p141
aVx + x = 2 \u2022 x.
p142
aVThis is a very nice pattern, and it's true,
p143
aVbecause 5 + 5 = 2 \u2022 5, etc.
p144
aVWe've seen this over and over, and we represent it like this.
p145
aVBut think about it: this is an equation.
p146
aVIt says that something is equal to something else,
p147
aVand that's two different perspectives.
p148
aVOne perspective is, it's a sum.
p149
aVIt's something you plus together.
p150
aVOn the other hand, it's a multiplication,
p151
aVand those are two different perspectives.
p152
aVAnd I would go as far as to say that every equation is like this,
p153
aVevery mathematical equation where you use that equality sign
p154
aVis actually a metaphor.
p155
aVIt's an analogy between two things.
p156
aVYou're just viewing something and taking two different points of view,
p157
aVand you're expressing that in a language.
p158
aa(lp159
VHave a look at this equation.
p160
aVThis is one of the most beautiful equations.
p161
aVIt simply says that, well,
p162
aVtwo things, they're both -1.
p163
aVThis thing on the left-hand side is -1, and the other one is.
p164
aVAnd that, I think, is one of the essential parts
p165
aVof mathematics \u2014 you take different points of view.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo let's just play around.
p168
aVLet's take a number.
p169
aVWe know four-thirds. We know what four-thirds is.
p170
aVIt's 1.333, but we have to have those three dots,
p171
aVotherwise it's not exactly four-thirds.
p172
aVBut this is only in base 10.
p173
aVYou know, the number system, we use 10 digits.
p174
aVIf we change that around and only use two digits,
p175
aVthat's called the binary system.
p176
aVIt's written like this.
p177
aVSo we're now talking about the number.
p178
aVThe number is four-thirds.
p179
aVWe can write it like this,
p180
aVand we can change the base, change the number of digits,
p181
aVand we can write it differently.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo these are all representations of the same number.
p184
aVWe can even write it simply, like 1.3 or 1.6.
p185
aVIt all depends on how many digits you have.
p186
aVOr perhaps we just simplify and write it like this.
p187
aVI like this one, because this says four divided by three.
p188
aVAnd this number expresses a relation between two numbers.
p189
aVYou have four on the one hand and three on the other.
p190
aVAnd you can visualize this in many ways.
p191
aVWhat I'm doing now is viewing that number from different perspectives.
p192
aVI'm playing around.
p193
aVI'm playing around with how we view something,
p194
aVand I'm doing it very deliberately.
p195
aVWe can take a grid.
p196
aVIf it's four across and three up, this line equals five, always.
p197
aVIt has to be like this. This is a beautiful pattern.
p198
aVFour and three and five.
p199
aVAnd this rectangle, which is 4 x 3,
p200
aVyou've seen a lot of times.
p201
aVThis is your average computer screen.
p202
aV800 x 600 or 1,600 x 1,200
p203
aVis a television or a computer screen.
p204
aa(lp205
VSo these are all nice representations,
p206
aVbut I want to go a little bit further and just play more with this number.
p207
aVHere you see two circles. I'm going to rotate them like this.
p208
aVObserve the upper-left one.
p209
aVIt goes a little bit faster, right?
p210
aVYou can see this.
p211
aVIt actually goes exactly four-thirds as fast.
p212
aVThat means that when it goes around four times,
p213
aVthe other one goes around three times.
p214
aVNow let's make two lines, and draw this dot where the lines meet.
p215
aVWe get this dot dancing around.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd this dot comes from that number.
p220
aVRight? Now we should trace it.
p221
aVLet's trace it and see what happens.
p222
aVThis is what mathematics is all about.
p223
aVIt's about seeing what happens.
p224
aVAnd this emerges from four-thirds.
p225
aVI like to say that this is the image of four-thirds.
p226
aVIt's much nicer \u2014 (Cheers)
p227
aa(lp228
VThank you!
p229
aa(lp230
V(Applause)
p231
aVThis is not new.
p232
aVThis has been known for a long time, but \u2014
p233
aa(lp234
V(Laughter)
p235
aa(lp236
VBut this is four-thirds.
p237
aa(lp238
VLet's do another experiment.
p239
aVLet's now take a sound, this sound: (Beep)
p240
aa(lp241
VThis is a perfect A, 440Hz.
p242
aVLet's multiply it by two.
p243
aVWe get this sound. (Beep)
p244
aa(lp245
VWhen we play them together, it sounds like this.
p246
aVThis is an octave, right?
p247
aVWe can do this game. We can play a sound, play the same A.
p248
aVWe can multiply it by three-halves.
p249
aa(lp250
V(Beep)
p251
aa(lp252
VThis is what we call a perfect fifth.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Beep)
p255
aa(lp256
VThey sound really nice together.
p257
aVLet's multiply this sound by four-thirds. (Beep)
p258
aa(lp259
VWhat happens?
p260
aVYou get this sound. (Beep)
p261
aa(lp262
VThis is the perfect fourth.
p263
aVIf the first one is an A, this is a D.
p264
aVThey sound like this together. (Beeps)
p265
aa(lp266
VThis is the sound of four-thirds.
p267
aVWhat I'm doing now, I'm changing my perspective.
p268
aVI'm just viewing a number from another perspective.
p269
aa(lp270
VI can even do this with rhythms, right?
p271
aVI can take a rhythm and play three beats at one time (Drumbeats)
p272
aa(lp273
Vin a period of time,
p274
aVand I can play another sound four times in that same space.
p275
aa(lp276
V(Clanking sounds)
p277
aa(lp278
VSounds kind of boring, but listen to them together.
p279
aa(lp280
V(Drumbeats and clanking sounds)
p281
aa(lp282
V(Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
VHey! So.
p285
aa(lp286
V(Laughter)
p287
aa(lp288
VI can even make a little hi-hat.
p289
aa(lp290
V(Drumbeats and cymbals)
p291
aa(lp292
VCan you hear this?
p293
aVSo, this is the sound of four-thirds.
p294
aVAgain, this is as a rhythm.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Drumbeats and cowbell)
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd I can keep doing this and play games with this number.
p299
aVFour-thirds is a really great number. I love four-thirds!
p300
aa(lp301
V(Laughter)
p302
aa(lp303
VTruly \u2014 it's an undervalued number.
p304
aVSo if you take a sphere and look at the volume of the sphere,
p305
aVit's actually four-thirds of some particular cylinder.
p306
aVSo four-thirds is in the sphere. It's the volume of the sphere.
p307
aa(lp308
VOK, so why am I doing all this?
p309
aVWell, I want to talk about what it means to understand something
p310
aVand what we mean by understanding something.
p311
aVThat's my aim here.
p312
aVAnd my claim is that you understand something
p313
aVif you have the ability to view it from different perspectives.
p314
aVLet's look at this letter. It's a beautiful R, right?
p315
aVHow do you know that?
p316
aVWell, as a matter of fact, you've seen a bunch of R's,
p317
aVand you've generalized
p318
aVand abstracted all of these and found a pattern.
p319
aVSo you know that this is an R.
p320
aa(lp321
VSo what I'm aiming for here is saying something
p322
aVabout how understanding and changing your perspective
p323
aVare linked.
p324
aVAnd I'm a teacher and a lecturer,
p325
aVand I can actually use this to teach something,
p326
aVbecause when I give someone else another story, a metaphor, an analogy,
p327
aVif I tell a story from a different point of view,
p328
aVI enable understanding.
p329
aVI make understanding possible,
p330
aVbecause you have to generalize over everything you see and hear,
p331
aVand if I give you another perspective, that will become easier for you.
p332
aa(lp333
VLet's do a simple example again.
p334
aVThis is four and three. This is four triangles.
p335
aVSo this is also four-thirds, in a way.
p336
aVLet's just join them together.
p337
aVNow we're going to play a game; we're going to fold it up
p338
aVinto a three-dimensional structure.
p339
aVI love this.
p340
aVThis is a square pyramid.
p341
aVAnd let's just take two of them and put them together.
p342
aVSo this is what is called an octahedron.
p343
aVIt's one of the five platonic solids.
p344
aVNow we can quite literally change our perspective,
p345
aVbecause we can rotate it around all of the axes
p346
aVand view it from different perspectives.
p347
aVAnd I can change the axis,
p348
aVand then I can view it from another point of view,
p349
aVbut it's the same thing, but it looks a little different.
p350
aVI can do it even one more time.
p351
aa(lp352
VEvery time I do this, something else appears,
p353
aVso I'm actually learning more about the object
p354
aVwhen I change my perspective.
p355
aVI can use this as a tool for creating understanding.
p356
aVI can take two of these and put them together like this
p357
aVand see what happens.
p358
aVAnd it looks a little bit like the octahedron.
p359
aVHave a look at it if I spin it around like this.
p360
aVWhat happens?
p361
aVWell, if you take two of these, join them together and spin it around,
p362
aVthere's your octahedron again,
p363
aVa beautiful structure.
p364
aVIf you lay it out flat on the floor,
p365
aVthis is the octahedron.
p366
aVThis is the graph structure of an octahedron.
p367
aVAnd I can continue doing this.
p368
aVYou can draw three great circles around the octahedron,
p369
aVand you rotate around,
p370
aVso actually three great circles is related to the octahedron.
p371
aVAnd if I take a bicycle pump and just pump it up,
p372
aVyou can see that this is also a little bit like the octahedron.
p373
aVDo you see what I'm doing here?
p374
aVI am changing the perspective every time.
p375
aa(lp376
VSo let's now take a step back \u2014
p377
aVand that's actually a metaphor, stepping back \u2014
p378
aVand have a look at what we're doing.
p379
aVI'm playing around with metaphors.
p380
aVI'm playing around with perspectives and analogies.
p381
aVI'm telling one story in different ways.
p382
aVI'm telling stories.
p383
aVI'm making a narrative; I'm making several narratives.
p384
aVAnd I think all of these things make understanding possible.
p385
aVI think this actually is the essence of understanding something.
p386
aVI truly believe this.
p387
aa(lp388
VSo this thing about changing your perspective \u2014
p389
aVit's absolutely fundamental for humans.
p390
aVLet's play around with the Earth.
p391
aVLet's zoom into the ocean, have a look at the ocean.
p392
aVWe can do this with anything.
p393
aVWe can take the ocean and view it up close.
p394
aVWe can look at the waves.
p395
aVWe can go to the beach.
p396
aVWe can view the ocean from another perspective.
p397
aVEvery time we do this, we learn a little bit more about the ocean.
p398
aVIf we go to the shore, we can kind of smell it, right?
p399
aVWe can hear the sound of the waves.
p400
aVWe can feel salt on our tongues.
p401
aVSo all of these are different perspectives.
p402
aVAnd this is the best one.
p403
aVWe can go into the water.
p404
aVWe can see the water from the inside.
p405
aVAnd you know what?
p406
aVThis is absolutely essential in mathematics and computer science.
p407
aVIf you're able to view a structure from the inside,
p408
aVthen you really learn something about it.
p409
aVThat's somehow the essence of something.
p410
aa(lp411
VSo when we do this, and we've taken this journey
p412
aVinto the ocean,
p413
aVwe use our imagination.
p414
aVAnd I think this is one level deeper,
p415
aVand it's actually a requirement for changing your perspective.
p416
aVWe can do a little game.
p417
aVYou can imagine that you're sitting there.
p418
aVYou can imagine that you're up here, and that you're sitting here.
p419
aVYou can view yourselves from the outside.
p420
aVThat's really a strange thing.
p421
aVYou're changing your perspective.
p422
aVYou're using your imagination,
p423
aVand you're viewing yourself from the outside.
p424
aVThat requires imagination.
p425
aa(lp426
VMathematics and computer science are the most imaginative art forms ever.
p427
aVAnd this thing about changing perspectives
p428
aVshould sound a little bit familiar to you,
p429
aVbecause we do it every day.
p430
aVAnd then it's called empathy.
p431
aVWhen I view the world from your perspective,
p432
aVI have empathy with you.
p433
aVIf I really, truly understand
p434
aVwhat the world looks like from your perspective,
p435
aVI am empathetic.
p436
aVThat requires imagination.
p437
aVAnd that is how we obtain understanding.
p438
aVAnd this is all over mathematics and this is all over computer science,
p439
aVand there's a really deep connection between empathy and these sciences.
p440
aa(lp441
VSo my conclusion is the following:
p442
aVunderstanding something really deeply
p443
aVhas to do with the ability to change your perspective.
p444
aVSo my advice to you is: try to change your perspective.
p445
aVYou can study mathematics.
p446
aVIt's a wonderful way to train your brain.
p447
aVChanging your perspective makes your mind more flexible.
p448
aVIt makes you open to new things,
p449
aVand it makes you able to understand things.
p450
aVAnd to use yet another metaphor:
p451
aVhave a mind like water.
p452
aVThat's nice.
p453
aa(lp454
VThank you.
