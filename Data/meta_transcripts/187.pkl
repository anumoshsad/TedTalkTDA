p4
aVI want to talk to you a little bit about user-generated content.
p5
aVI'm going to tell you three stories on the way to one argument
p6
aVthat's going to tell you a little bit
p7
aVabout how we open user-generated content up for business.
p8
aVSo, here's the first story.
p9
aa(lp10
V1906. This man, John Philip Sousa, traveled to this place,
p11
aVthe United States Capitol, to talk about this technology,
p12
aVwhat he called the, quote, "talking machines."
p13
aVSousa was not a fan of the talking machines.
p14
aVThis is what he had to say.
p15
aV"These talking machines are going to ruin artistic development
p16
aVof music in this country.
p17
aVWhen I was a boy, in front of every house in the summer evenings,
p18
aVyou would find young people together
p19
aVsinging the songs of the day, or the old songs.
p20
aVToday, you hear these infernal machines going night and day.
p21
aVWe will not have a vocal chord left," Sousa said.
p22
aV"The vocal chords will be eliminated by a process of evolution
p23
aVas was the tail of man when he came from the ape."
p24
aa(lp25
VNow, this is the picture I want you to focus on.
p26
aVThis is a picture of culture.
p27
aVWe could describe it using modern computer terminology
p28
aVas a kind of read-write culture.
p29
aVIt's a culture where people participate in the creation
p30
aVand the re-creation of their culture. In that sense, it's read-write.
p31
aVSousa's fear was that we would lose that capacity
p32
aVbecause of these, quote, "infernal machines." They would take it away.
p33
aVAnd in its place, we'd have the opposite of read-write culture,
p34
aVwhat we could call read-only culture.
p35
aVCulture where creativity was consumed
p36
aVbut the consumer is not a creator.
p37
aVA culture which is top-down, owned,
p38
aVwhere the vocal chords of the millions have been lost.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow, as you look back at the twentieth century,
p41
aVat least in what we think of as the, quote, "developed world" \u2014
p42
aVhard not to conclude that Sousa was right.
p43
aVNever before in the history of human culture
p44
aVhad it been as professionalized, never before as concentrated.
p45
aVNever before has creativity of the millions
p46
aVbeen as effectively displaced,
p47
aVand displaced because of these, quote, "infernal machines."
p48
aVThe twentieth century was that century
p49
aVwhere, at least for those places we know the best,
p50
aVculture moved from this read-write to read-only existence.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo, second. Land is a kind of property \u2014
p53
aVit is property. It's protected by law.
p54
aVAs Lord Blackstone described it, land is protected by trespass law,
p55
aVfor most of the history of trespass law,
p56
aVby presuming it protects the land all the way down below
p57
aVand to an indefinite extent upward.
p58
aVNow, that was a pretty good system
p59
aVfor most of the history of the regulation of land,
p60
aVuntil this technology came along, and people began to wonder,
p61
aVwere these instruments trespassers
p62
aVas they flew over land without clearing the rights
p63
aVof the farms below as they traveled across the country?
p64
aVWell, in 1945, Supreme Court got a chance to address that question.
p65
aa(lp66
VTwo farmers, Thomas Lee and Tinie Causby, who raised chickens,
p67
aVhad a significant complaint because of these technologies.
p68
aVThe complaint was that their
p69
aVchickens followed the pattern of the airplanes
p70
aVand flew themselves into the walls of the barn
p71
aVwhen the airplanes flew over the land.
p72
aVAnd so they appealed to Lord Blackstone
p73
aVto say these airplanes were trespassing.
p74
aVSince time immemorial, the law had said,
p75
aVyou can't fly over the land without permission of the landowner,
p76
aVso this flight must stop.
p77
aVWell, the Supreme Court considered this 100-years tradition
p78
aVand said, in an opinion written by Justice Douglas,
p79
aVthat the Causbys must lose.
p80
aVThe Supreme Court said the doctrine protecting land
p81
aVall the way to the sky has no place in the modern world,
p82
aVotherwise every transcontinental flight would
p83
aVsubject the operator to countless trespass suits.
p84
aVCommon sense, a rare idea in the law, but here it was. Common sense \u2014
p85
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p86
aVRevolts at the idea. Common sense.
p87
aa(lp88
VFinally. Before the Internet, the last great terror
p89
aVto rain down on the content industry
p90
aVwas a terror created by this technology. Broadcasting:
p91
aVa new way to spread content,
p92
aVand therefore a new battle over the control
p93
aVof the businesses that would spread content.
p94
aVNow, at that time, the entity,
p95
aVthe legal cartel, that controlled the performance rights
p96
aVfor most of the music that would be broadcast
p97
aVusing these technologies was ASCAP.
p98
aVThey had an exclusive license on the most popular content,
p99
aVand they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrate
p100
aVto the broadcasters who really was in charge.
p101
aVSo, between 1931 and 1939, they raised rates by some 448 percent,
p102
aVuntil the broadcasters finally got together
p103
aVand said, okay, enough of this.
p104
aVAnd in 1939, a lawyer, Sydney Kaye, started something
p105
aVcalled Broadcast Music Inc. We know it as BMI.
p106
aVAnd BMI was much more democratic in the art
p107
aVthat it would include within its repertoire,
p108
aVincluding African American music for the first time in the repertoire.
p109
aVBut most important was that BMI took public domain works
p110
aVand made arrangements of them, which they gave away for free
p111
aVto their subscribers. So that in 1940,
p112
aVwhen ASCAP threatened to double their rates,
p113
aVthe majority of broadcasters switched to BMI.
p114
aVNow, ASCAP said they didn't care.
p115
aVThe people will revolt, they predicted, because the very best music
p116
aVwas no longer available, because they had shifted
p117
aVto the second best public domain provided by BMI.
p118
aVWell, they didn't revolt, and in 1941, ASCAP cracked.
p119
aVAnd the important point to recognize
p120
aVis that even though these broadcasters
p121
aVwere broadcasting something you would call second best,
p122
aVthat competition was enough to break, at that time,
p123
aVthis legal cartel over access to music.
p124
aa(lp125
VOkay. Three stories. Here's the argument.
p126
aVIn my view, the most significant thing to recognize
p127
aVabout what this Internet is doing
p128
aVis its opportunity to revive the read-write culture
p129
aVthat Sousa romanticized.
p130
aVDigital technology is the opportunity
p131
aVfor the revival of these vocal chords
p132
aVthat he spoke so passionately to Congress about.
p133
aVUser-generated content, spreading in businesses
p134
aVin extraordinarily valuable ways like these,
p135
aVcelebrating amateur culture.
p136
aVBy which I don't mean amateurish culture,
p137
aVI mean culture where people produce
p138
aVfor the love of what they're doing and not for the money.
p139
aVI mean the culture that your kids are producing all the time.
p140
aVFor when you think of what Sousa romanticized
p141
aVin the young people together, singing the songs of the day,
p142
aVof the old songs, you should recognize
p143
aVwhat your kids are doing right now.
p144
aVTaking the songs of the day and the old songs
p145
aVand remixing them to make them something different.
p146
aVIt's how they understand access to this culture.
p147
aVSo, let's have some very few examples
p148
aVto get a sense of what I'm talking about here.
p149
aa(lp150
VHere's something called Anime Music Video, first example,
p151
aVtaking anime captured from television
p152
aVre-edited to music tracks.
p153
aV(Music)
p154
aVThis one you should be \u2014 confidence. Jesus survives. Don't worry.
p155
aV(Music)
p156
aV(Laughter)
p157
aVAnd this is the best.
p158
aV(Music)
p159
aVMy love ...
p160
aVThere's only you in my life ...
p161
aVThe only thing that's bright ...
p162
aVMy first love ...
p163
aVYou're every breath that I take ...
p164
aVYou're every step I make ...
p165
aVAnd I ....
p166
aVI want to share all my love with you ...
p167
aVNo one else will do ...
p168
aVAnd your eyes ...
p169
aVThey tell me how much you care ...
p170
aV(Music)
p171
aVSo, this is remix, right?
p172
aV(Applause)
p173
aVAnd it's important to emphasize that what this is not
p174
aVis not what we call, quote, "piracy."
p175
aVI'm not talking about nor justifying
p176
aVpeople taking other people's content in wholesale
p177
aVand distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner.
p178
aVI'm talking about people taking and recreating
p179
aVusing other people's content, using digital technologies
p180
aVto say things differently.
p181
aVNow, the importance of this
p182
aVis not the technique that you've seen here.
p183
aVBecause, of course, every technique that you've seen here
p184
aVis something that television and film producers
p185
aVhave been able to do for the last 50 years.
p186
aVThe importance is that that technique has been democratized.
p187
aVIt is now anybody with access to a $1,500 computer
p188
aVwho can take sounds and images from the culture around us
p189
aVand use it to say things differently.
p190
aVThese tools of creativity have become tools of speech.
p191
aVIt is a literacy for this generation. This is how our kids speak.
p192
aVIt is how our kids think. It is what your kids are
p193
aVas they increasingly understand digital technologies
p194
aVand their relationship to themselves.
p195
aa(lp196
VNow, in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies,
p197
aVthe law has not greeted this Sousa revival
p198
aVwith very much common sense.
p199
aVInstead, the architecture of copyright law
p200
aVand the architecture of digital technologies,
p201
aVas they interact, have produced the presumption
p202
aVthat these activities are illegal.
p203
aVBecause if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies,
p204
aVthen in the digital world the one fact we can't escape
p205
aVis that every single use of culture produces a copy.
p206
aVEvery single use therefore requires permission;
p207
aVwithout permission, you are a trespasser.
p208
aVYou're a trespasser with about as much sense
p209
aVas these people were trespassers.
p210
aVCommon sense here, though, has not yet revolted
p211
aVin response to this response that the law has offered
p212
aVto these forms of creativity.
p213
aVInstead, what we've seen
p214
aVis something much worse than a revolt.
p215
aVThere's a growing extremism that comes from both sides
p216
aVin this debate, in response to this conflict
p217
aVbetween the law and the use of these technologies.
p218
aa(lp219
VOne side builds new technologies, such as one recently announced
p220
aVthat will enable them
p221
aVto automatically take down from sites like YouTube
p222
aVany content that has any copyrighted content in it,
p223
aVwhether or not there's a judgment of fair use
p224
aVthat might be applied to the use of that content.
p225
aVAnd on the other side, among our kids,
p226
aVthere's a growing copyright abolitionism,
p227
aVa generation that rejects the very notion
p228
aVof what copyright is supposed to do, rejects copyright
p229
aVand believes that the law is nothing more than an ass
p230
aVto be ignored and to be fought at every opportunity possible.
p231
aVThe extremism on one side begets extremism on the other,
p232
aVa fact we should have learned many, many times over,
p233
aVand both extremes in this debate are just wrong.
p234
aVNow, the balance that I try to fight for,
p235
aVI, as any good liberal, try to fight for first
p236
aVby looking to the government. Total mistake, right?
p237
aV(Laughter)
p238
aa(lp239
VLooked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them
p240
aVto do something to make the system make more sense.
p241
aVIt failed partly because the courts are too passive,
p242
aVpartly because the legislatures are corrupted,
p243
aVby which I don't mean that there's bribery
p244
aVoperating to stop real change,
p245
aVbut more the economy of influence that governs how Congress functions
p246
aVmeans that policymakers here will not understand this
p247
aVuntil it's too late to fix it.
p248
aVSo, we need something different, we need a different kind of solution.
p249
aVAnd the solution here, in my view, is a private solution,
p250
aVa solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again,
p251
aVand to realize the economic potential of that,
p252
aVand that's where the story of BMI becomes relevant.
p253
aVBecause, as BMI demonstrated, competition here
p254
aVcan achieve some form of balance. The same thing can happen now.
p255
aVWe don't have a public domain to draw upon now,
p256
aVso instead what we need is two types of changes.
p257
aa(lp258
VFirst, that artists and creators embrace the idea,
p259
aVchoose that their work be made available more freely.
p260
aVSo, for example, they can say their work is available freely
p261
aVfor non-commercial, this amateur-type of use,
p262
aVbut not freely for any commercial use.
p263
aVAnd second, we need the businesses
p264
aVthat are building out this read-write culture
p265
aVto embrace this opportunity expressly, to enable it,
p266
aVso that this ecology of free content, or freer content,
p267
aVcan grow on a neutral platform
p268
aVwhere they both exist simultaneously,
p269
aVso that more-free can compete with less-free,
p270
aVand the opportunity to develop the creativity in that competition
p271
aVcan teach one the lessons of the other.
p272
aa(lp273
VNow, I would talk about one particular such plan
p274
aVthat I know something about,
p275
aVbut I don't want to violate TED's first commandment of selling,
p276
aVso I'm not going to talk about this at all.
p277
aVI'm instead just going to remind you of the point that BMI teaches us.
p278
aVThat artist choice is the key for new technology
p279
aVhaving an opportunity to be open for business,
p280
aVand we need to build artist choice here
p281
aVif these new technologies are to have that opportunity.
p282
aVBut let me end with something I think much more important \u2014
p283
aVmuch more important than business.
p284
aVIt's the point about how this connects to our kids.
p285
aVWe have to recognize they're different from us. This is us, right?
p286
aV(Laughter)
p287
aVWe made mixed tapes; they remix music.
p288
aVWe watched TV; they make TV.
p289
aa(lp290
VIt is technology that has made them different,
p291
aVand as we see what this technology can do,
p292
aVwe need to recognize you can't kill
p293
aVthe instinct the technology produces. We can only criminalize it.
p294
aVWe can't stop our kids from using it.
p295
aVWe can only drive it underground.
p296
aVWe can't make our kids passive again.
p297
aVWe can only make them, quote, "pirates." And is that good?
p298
aVWe live in this weird time. It's kind of age of prohibitions,
p299
aVwhere in many areas of our life,
p300
aVwe live life constantly against the law.
p301
aVOrdinary people live life against the law,
p302
aVand that's what I \u2014 we are doing to our kids.
p303
aVThey live life knowing they live it against the law.
p304
aVThat realization is extraordinarily corrosive,
p305
aVextraordinarily corrupting.
p306
aVAnd in a democracy, we ought to be able to do better.
p307
aVDo better, at least for them, if not for opening for business.
p308
aVThank you very much.
