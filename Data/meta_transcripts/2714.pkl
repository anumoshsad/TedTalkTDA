VWell, as many of you know,
p4
aVthe results of the recent election were as follows:
p5
aVHillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate
p6
aVwon a landslide victory
p7
aVwith 52 percent of the overall vote.
p8
aVJill Stein, the Green candidate,
p9
aVcame a distant second, with 19 percent.
p10
aVDonald J. Trump, the Republic candidate,
p11
aVwas hot on her heels with 14 percent,
p12
aVand the remainder of the vote were shared between abstainers
p13
aVand Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate.
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VNow, what parallel universe do you suppose I live in?
p18
aVWell, I don't live in a parallel universe.
p19
aVI live in the world, and that is how the world voted.
p20
aVSo let me take you back and explain what I mean by that.
p21
aa(lp22
VIn June this year,
p23
aVI launched something called the Global Vote.
p24
aVAnd the Global Vote does exactly what it says on the tin.
p25
aVFor the first time in history,
p26
aVit lets anybody, anywhere in the world,
p27
aVvote in the elections of other people's countries.
p28
aVNow, why would you do that?
p29
aVWhat's the point?
p30
aVWell, let me show you what it looks like.
p31
aVYou go to a website,
p32
aVrather a beautiful website,
p33
aVand then you select an election.
p34
aVHere's a bunch that we've already covered.
p35
aVWe do about one a month, or thereabouts.
p36
aVSo you can see Bulgaria, the United States of America,
p37
aVSecretary-General of the United Nations,
p38
aVthe Brexit referendum at the end there.
p39
aVYou select the election that you're interested in,
p40
aVand you pick the candidates.
p41
aVThese are the candidates from the recent presidential election
p42
aVin the tiny island nation of São Tomé and Príncipe,
p43
aV199,000 inhabitants,
p44
aVoff the coast of West Africa.
p45
aVAnd then you can look at the brief summary of each of those candidates
p46
aVwhich I dearly hope is very neutral,
p47
aVvery informative and very succinct.
p48
aVAnd when you've found the one you like, you vote.
p49
aVThese were the candidates
p50
aVin the recent Icelandic presidential election,
p51
aVand that's the way it goes.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo why on earth would you want to vote in another country's election?
p54
aVWell, the reason that you wouldn't want to do it,
p55
aVlet me reassure you,
p56
aVis in order to interfere in the democratic processes of another country.
p57
aVThat's not the purpose at all.
p58
aVIn fact, you can't,
p59
aVbecause usually what I do is I release the results
p60
aVafter the electorate in each individual country has already voted,
p61
aVso there's no way that we could interfere in that process.
p62
aVBut more importantly,
p63
aVI'm not particularly interested
p64
aVin the domestic issues of individual countries.
p65
aVThat's not what we're voting on.
p66
aVSo what Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton proposed to do for the Americans
p67
aVis frankly none of our business.
p68
aVThat's something that only the Americans can vote on.
p69
aa(lp70
VNo, in the global vote, you're only considering one aspect of it,
p71
aVwhich is what are those leaders going to do for the rest of us?
p72
aVAnd that's so very important because we live,
p73
aVas no doubt you're sick of hearing people tell you,
p74
aVin a globalized, hyperconnected, massively interdependent world
p75
aVwhere the political decisions of people in other countries
p76
aVcan and will have an impact on our lives
p77
aVno matter who we are, no matter where we live.
p78
aVLike the wings of the butterfly
p79
aVbeating on one side of the Pacific
p80
aVthat can apparently create a hurricane on the other side,
p81
aVso it is with the world that we live in today
p82
aVand the world of politics.
p83
aVThere is no longer a dividing line between domestic and international affairs.
p84
aVAny country, no matter how small,
p85
aVeven if it's São Tomé and Príncipe,
p86
aVcould produce the next Nelson Mandela
p87
aVor the next Stalin.
p88
aVThey could pollute the atmosphere and the oceans, which belong to all of us,
p89
aVor they could be responsible and they could help all of us.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd yet, the system is so strange
p92
aVbecause the system hasn't caught up with this globalized reality.
p93
aVOnly a small number of people are allowed to vote for those leaders,
p94
aVeven though their impact is gigantic
p95
aVand almost universal.
p96
aVWhat number was it?
p97
aV140 million Americans voted
p98
aVfor the next president of the United States,
p99
aVand yet, as all of us knows, in a few weeks time,
p100
aVsomebody is going to hand over the nuclear launch codes
p101
aVto Donald J. Trump.
p102
aVNow, if that isn't having a potential impact on all of us,
p103
aVI don't know what is.
p104
aVSimilarly, the election for the referendum on the Brexit vote,
p105
aVa small number of millions of British people voted on that,
p106
aVbut the outcome of the vote, whichever way it went,
p107
aVwould have had a significant impact
p108
aVon the lives of tens, hundreds of millions of people around the world.
p109
aVAnd yet, only a tiny number could vote.
p110
aa(lp111
VWhat kind of democracy is that?
p112
aVHuge decisions that affect all of us
p113
aVbeing decided by relatively very small numbers of people.
p114
aVAnd I don't know about you,
p115
aVbut I don't think that sounds very democratic.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo I'm trying to clear it up.
p118
aVBut as I say,
p119
aVwe don't ask about domestic questions.
p120
aVIn fact, I only ever ask two questions of all of the candidates.
p121
aVI send them the same two questions every single time.
p122
aVI say, one,
p123
aVif you get elected, what are you going to do for the rest of us,
p124
aVfor the remainder of the seven billion who live on this planet?
p125
aVSecond question:
p126
aVWhat is your vision for your country's future in the world?
p127
aVWhat role do you see it playing?
p128
aVEvery candidate, I send them those questions.
p129
aVThey don't all answer. Don't get me wrong.
p130
aVI reckon if you're standing
p131
aVto become the next president of the United States,
p132
aVyou're probably pretty tied up most of the time,
p133
aVso I'm not altogether surprised that they don't all answer, but many do.
p134
aVMore every time.
p135
aVAnd some of them do much more than answer.
p136
aVSome of them answer in the most enthusiastic and most exciting way
p137
aVyou could imagine.
p138
aa(lp139
VI just want to say a word here for Saviour Chishimba,
p140
aVwho was one of the candidates
p141
aVin the recent Zambian presidential election.
p142
aVHis answers to those two questions were basically an 18-page dissertation
p143
aVon his view of Zambia's potential role in the world
p144
aVand in the international community.
p145
aVI posted it on the website so anybody could read it.
p146
aVNow, Saviour won the global vote,
p147
aVbut he didn't win the Zambian election.
p148
aa(lp149
VSo I found myself wondering,
p150
aVwhat am I going to do with this extraordinary group of people?
p151
aVI've got some wonderful people here who won the global vote.
p152
aVWe always get it wrong, by the way.
p153
aVThe one that we elect
p154
aVis never the person who's elected by the domestic electorate.
p155
aVThat may be partly because we always seem to go for the woman.
p156
aVBut I think it may also be a sign
p157
aVthat the domestic electorate is still thinking very nationally.
p158
aVThey're still thinking very inwardly.
p159
aVThey're still asking themselves: What's in it for me? ...
p160
aVinstead of what they should be asking today,
p161
aVwhich is, what's in it for we?
p162
aa(lp163
VBut there you go.
p164
aVSo suggestions, please, not right now,
p165
aVbut send me an email if you've got an idea
p166
aVabout what we can do with this amazing team of glorious losers.
p167
aV(Laughter)
p168
aVWe've got Saviour Chishimba, who I mentioned before.
p169
aVWe've got Halla Tómasdóttir,
p170
aVwho was the runner up in the Icelandic presidential election.
p171
aVMany of you may have seen her amazing talk at TEDWomen
p172
aVjust a few weeks ago
p173
aVwhere she spoke about the need for more women to get into politics.
p174
aVWe've got Maria das Neves from São Tomé and Príncipe.
p175
aVWe've got Hillary Clinton.
p176
aVI don't know if she's available.
p177
aVWe've got Jill Stein.
p178
aVAnd we covered also the election
p179
aVfor the next Secretary-General of the United Nations.
p180
aVWe've got the ex-prime minister of New Zealand,
p181
aVwho would be a wonderful member of the team.
p182
aVSo I think maybe those people,
p183
aVthe glorious loser's club, could travel around the world
p184
aVwherever there's an election
p185
aVand remind people of the necessity in our modern age
p186
aVof thinking a little bit outwards
p187
aVand thinking of the international consequences.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo what comes next for the global vote?
p190
aVWell, obviously,
p191
aVthe Donald and Hillary show is a bit of a difficult one to follow,
p192
aVbut there are some other really important elections coming up.
p193
aVIn fact, they seem to be multiplying.
p194
aVThere's something going on, I'm sure you've noticed, in the world.
p195
aVAnd the next row of elections are all critically important.
p196
aVIn just a few day's time
p197
aVwe've got the rerun of the Austrian presidential election,
p198
aVwith the prospect of Norbert Hofer
p199
aVbecoming what is commonly described
p200
aVas the first far-right head of state in Europe since the Second World War.
p201
aVNext year we've got Germany,
p202
aVwe've got France,
p203
aVwe've got presidential elections in Iran
p204
aVand a dozen others.
p205
aVIt doesn't get less important.
p206
aVIt gets more and more important.
p207
aa(lp208
VClearly, the global vote is not a stand-alone project.
p209
aVIt's not just there on its own.
p210
aVIt has some background.
p211
aVIt's part of a project which I launched back in 2014,
p212
aVwhich I call the Good Country.
p213
aVThe idea of the Good Country is basically very simple.
p214
aVIt's my simple diagnosis of what's wrong with the world
p215
aVand how we can fix it.
p216
aVWhat's wrong with the world I've already hinted at.
p217
aVBasically, we face an enormous and growing number
p218
aVof gigantic, existential global challenges:
p219
aVclimate change, human rights abuses,
p220
aVmass migration, terrorism, economic chaos, weapons proliferation.
p221
aVAll of these problems which threaten to wipe us out
p222
aVare by their very nature globalized problems.
p223
aVNo individual country has the capability of tackling them on its own.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd so very obviously
p226
aVwe have to cooperate and we have to collaborate as nations
p227
aVif we're going to solve these problems.
p228
aVIt's so obvious, and yet we don't.
p229
aVWe don't do it nearly often enough.
p230
aVMost of the time, countries still persist in behaving
p231
aVas if they were warring, selfish tribes battling against each other,
p232
aVmuch as they have done since the nation-state was invented
p233
aVhundreds of years ago.
p234
aVAnd this has got to change.
p235
aVThis is not a change in political systems or a change in ideology.
p236
aVThis is a change in culture.
p237
aa(lp238
VWe, all of us, have to understand
p239
aVthat thinking inwards is not the solution to the world's problems.
p240
aVWe have to learn how to cooperate and collaborate a great deal more
p241
aVand compete just a tiny bit less.
p242
aVOtherwise things are going to carry on getting bad
p243
aVand they're going to get much worse, much sooner than we anticipate.
p244
aVThis change will only happen
p245
aVif we ordinary people
p246
aVtell our politicians that things have changed.
p247
aVWe have to tell them that the culture has changed.
p248
aVWe have to tell them that they've got a new mandate.
p249
aVThe old mandate was very simple and very single:
p250
aVif you're in a position of power or authority,
p251
aVyou're responsible for your own people and your own tiny slice of territory,
p252
aVand that's it.
p253
aVAnd if in order to do the best thing for your own people,
p254
aVyou screw over everybody else on the planet, that's even better.
p255
aVThat's considered to be a bit macho.
p256
aVToday, I think everybody in a position of power and responsibility
p257
aVhas got a dual mandate,
p258
aVwhich says if you're in a position of power and responsibility,
p259
aVyou're responsible for your own people
p260
aVand for every single man, woman, child and animal on the planet.
p261
aVYou're responsible for your own slice of territory
p262
aVand for every single square mile of the earth's surface
p263
aVand the atmosphere above it.
p264
aVAnd if you don't like that responsibility, you should not be in power.
p265
aVThat for me is the rule of the modern age,
p266
aVand that's the message that we've got to get across to our politicians,
p267
aVand show them that that's the way things are done these days.
p268
aVOtherwise, we're all screwed.
p269
aa(lp270
VI don't have a problem, actually,
p271
aVwith Donald Trump's credo of "America first."
p272
aVIt seems to me that that's a pretty banal statement
p273
aVof what politicians have always done and probably should always do.
p274
aVOf course they're elected to represent the interests of their own people.
p275
aVBut what I find so boring and so old-fashioned
p276
aVand so unimaginative about his take on that
p277
aVis that America first means everyone else last,
p278
aVthat making America great again means making everybody else small again,
p279
aVand it's just not true.
p280
aVIn my job as a policy advisor over the last 20 years or so,
p281
aVI've seen so many hundreds of examples of policies
p282
aVthat harmonize the international and the domestic needs,
p283
aVand they make better policy.
p284
aVI'm not asking nations to be altruistic or self-sacrificing.
p285
aVThat would be ridiculous.
p286
aVNo nation would ever do that.
p287
aVI'm asking them to wake up and understand that we need a new form of governance,
p288
aVwhich is possible
p289
aVand which harmonizes those two needs,
p290
aVthose good for our own people and those good for everybody else.
p291
aVSince the US election and since Brexit
p292
aVit's become more and more obvious to me
p293
aVthat those old distinctions of left wing and right wing
p294
aVno longer make sense.
p295
aVThey really don't fit the pattern.
p296
aVWhat does seem to matter today
p297
aVis very simple,
p298
aVwhether your view of the world is
p299
aVthat you take comfort from looking inwards and backwards,
p300
aVor whether, like me, you find hope in looking forwards and outwards.
p301
aVThat's the new politics.
p302
aVThat's the new division that is splitting the world right down the middle.
p303
aVNow, that may sound judgmental, but it's not meant to be.
p304
aVI don't at all misunderstand
p305
aVwhy so many people find their comfort in looking inwards and backwards.
p306
aVWhen times are difficult, when you're short of money,
p307
aVwhen you're feeling insecure and vulnerable,
p308
aVit's almost a natural human tendency to turn inwards,
p309
aVto think of your own needs
p310
aVand to discard everybody else's,
p311
aVand perhaps to start to imagine that the past was somehow better
p312
aVthan the present or the future could ever be.
p313
aVBut I happen to believe that that's a dead end.
p314
aVHistory shows us that it's a dead end.
p315
aVWhen people turn inwards and turn backwards,
p316
aVhuman progress becomes reversed
p317
aVand things get worse for everybody very quickly indeed.
p318
aVIf you're like me
p319
aVand you believe in forwards and outwards,
p320
aVand you believe that the best thing about humanity is its diversity,
p321
aVand the best thing about globalization
p322
aVis the way that it stirs up that diversity, that cultural mixture
p323
aVto make something more creative, more exciting, more productive
p324
aVthan there's ever been before in human history,
p325
aVthen, my friends, we've got a job on our hands,
p326
aVbecause the inwards and backwards brigade
p327
aVare uniting as never before,
p328
aVand that creed of inwards and backwards,
p329
aVthat fear, that anxiety,
p330
aVplaying on the simplest instincts,
p331
aVis sweeping across the world.
p332
aVThose of us who believe,
p333
aVas I believe, in forwards and outwards,
p334
aVwe have to get ourselves organized,
p335
aVbecause time is running out very, very quickly.
