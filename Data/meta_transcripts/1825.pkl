VDemocracy is in trouble, no question about that,
p4
aVand it comes in part from a deep dilemma
p5
aVin which it is embedded.
p6
aVIt's increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of decisions
p7
aVwe face that have to do with global pandemics,
p8
aVa cross-border problem;
p9
aVwith HIV, a transnational problem;
p10
aVwith markets and immigration,
p11
aVsomething that goes beyond national borders;
p12
aVwith terrorism, with war,
p13
aVall now cross-border problems.
p14
aa(lp15
VIn fact, we live in a 21st-century world
p16
aVof interdependence,
p17
aVand brutal interdependent problems,
p18
aVand when we look for solutions in politics and in democracy,
p19
aVwe are faced with political institutions
p20
aVdesigned 400 years ago,
p21
aVautonomous, sovereign nation-states
p22
aVwith jurisdictions and territories
p23
aVseparate from one another,
p24
aVeach claiming to be able to solve the problem
p25
aVof its own people.
p26
aVTwenty-first-century, transnational world
p27
aVof problems and challenges,
p28
aV17th-century world of political institutions.
p29
aVIn that dilemma lies the central problem of democracy.
p30
aVAnd like many others, I've been thinking about
p31
aVwhat can one do about this, this asymmetry
p32
aVbetween 21st-century challenges
p33
aVand archaic and increasingly dysfunctional
p34
aVpolitical institutions like nation-states.
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd my suggestion is
p37
aVthat we change the subject,
p38
aVthat we stop talking about nations,
p39
aVabout bordered states,
p40
aVand we start talking about cities.
p41
aVBecause I think you will find, when we talk about cities,
p42
aVwe are talking about the political institutions
p43
aVin which civilization and culture were born.
p44
aVWe are talking about the cradle of democracy.
p45
aa(lp46
VWe are talking about the venues in which
p47
aVthose public spaces where we come together
p48
aVto create democracy, and at the same time
p49
aVprotest those who would take our freedom, take place.
p50
aVThink of some great names:
p51
aVthe Place de la Bastille,
p52
aVZuccotti Park,
p53
aVTahrir Square,
p54
aVTaksim Square in today's headlines in Istanbul,
p55
aVor, yes,
p56
aVTiananmen Square in Beijing.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Applause)
p59
aa(lp60
VThose are the public spaces
p61
aVwhere we announce ourselves as citizens,
p62
aVas participants, as people with the right
p63
aVto write our own narratives.
p64
aVCities are not only the oldest of institutions,
p65
aVthey're the most enduring.
p66
aVIf you think about it,
p67
aVConstantinople, Istanbul, much older than Turkey.
p68
aVAlexandria, much older than Egypt.
p69
aVRome, far older than Italy.
p70
aVCities endure the ages.
p71
aVThey are the places where we are born,
p72
aVgrow up, are educated, work, marry,
p73
aVpray, play, get old, and in time, die.
p74
aVThey are home.
p75
aVVery different than nation-states,
p76
aVwhich are abstractions.
p77
aVWe pay taxes, we vote occasionally,
p78
aVwe watch the men and women we choose rule
p79
aVrule more or less without us.
p80
aVNot so in those homes known as our towns
p81
aVand cities where we live.
p82
aVMoreover, today, more than half of the world's population
p83
aVlive in cities.
p84
aVIn the developed world, it's about 78 percent.
p85
aVMore than three out of four people
p86
aVlive in urban institutions, urban places,
p87
aVin cities today.
p88
aVSo cities are where the action is.
p89
aVCities are us. Aristotle said in the ancient world,
p90
aVman is a political animal.
p91
aVI say we are an urban animal.
p92
aVWe are an urban species, at home in our cities.
p93
aVSo to come back to the dilemma,
p94
aVif the dilemma is we have old-fashioned
p95
aVpolitical nation-states unable to govern the world,
p96
aVrespond to the global challenges that we face
p97
aVlike climate change,
p98
aVthen maybe it's time for mayors to rule the world,
p99
aVfor mayors and the citizens and the peoples they represent
p100
aVto engage in global governance.
p101
aa(lp102
VWhen I say if mayors ruled the world,
p103
aVwhen I first came up with that phrase,
p104
aVit occurred to me that actually, they already do.
p105
aVThere are scores of international, inter-city,
p106
aVcross-border institutions, networks of cities
p107
aVin which cities are already, quite quietly,
p108
aVbelow the horizon, working together
p109
aVto deal with climate change, to deal with security,
p110
aVto deal with immigration,
p111
aVto deal with all of those tough,
p112
aVinterdependent problems that we face.
p113
aVThey have strange names:
p114
aVUCLG,
p115
aVUnited Cities and Local Governments;
p116
aVICLEI,
p117
aVthe International Council for Local Environmental Issues.
p118
aVAnd the list goes on:
p119
aVCitynet in Asia; City Protocol, a new organization
p120
aVout of Barcelona that is using the web
p121
aVto share best practices among countries.
p122
aVAnd then all the things we know a little better,
p123
aVthe U.S. Conference of Mayors,
p124
aVthe Mexican Conference of Mayors,
p125
aVthe European Conference of Mayors.
p126
aVMayors are where this is happening.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd so the question is,
p129
aVhow can we create a world
p130
aVin which mayors and the citizens they represent
p131
aVplay a more prominent role?
p132
aVWell, to understand that,
p133
aVwe need to understand why cities are special,
p134
aVwhy mayors are so different
p135
aVthan prime ministers and presidents,
p136
aVbecause my premise is that a mayor and a prime minister
p137
aVare at the opposite ends of a political spectrum.
p138
aVTo be a prime minister or a president,
p139
aVyou have to have an ideology,
p140
aVyou have to have a meta-narrative,
p141
aVyou have to have a theory of how things work,
p142
aVyou have to belong to a party.
p143
aVIndependents, on the whole,
p144
aVdon't get elected to office.
p145
aVBut mayors are just the opposite.
p146
aVMayors are pragmatists, they're problem-solvers.
p147
aVTheir job is to get things done, and if they don't,
p148
aVthey're out of a job.
p149
aVMayor Nutter of Philadelphia said,
p150
aVwe could never get away here in Philadelphia
p151
aVwith the stuff that goes on in Washington,
p152
aVthe paralysis, the non-action, the inaction.
p153
aVWhy? Because potholes have to get filled,
p154
aVbecause the trains have to run,
p155
aVbecause kids have to be able to get to school.
p156
aVAnd that's what we have to do,
p157
aVand to do that is about pragmatism
p158
aVin that deep, American sense,
p159
aVreaching outcomes.
p160
aVWashington, Beijing, Paris, as world capitals,
p161
aVare anything but pragmatic,
p162
aVbut real city mayors have to be pragmatists.
p163
aVThey have to get things done,
p164
aVthey have to put ideology and religion and ethnicity aside
p165
aVand draw their cities together.
p166
aVWe saw this a couple of decades ago
p167
aVwhen Teddy Kollek, the great mayor of Jerusalem
p168
aVin the '80s and the '90s,
p169
aVwas besieged one day in his office
p170
aVby religious leaders from all of the backgrounds,
p171
aVChristian prelates, rabbis, imams.
p172
aVThey were arguing with one another
p173
aVabout access to the holy sites.
p174
aVAnd the squabble went on and on,
p175
aVand Kollek listened and listened,
p176
aVand he finally said, "Gentlemen,
p177
aVspare me your sermons,
p178
aVand I will fix your sewers."
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VThat's what mayors do.
p183
aVThey fix sewers, they get the trains running.
p184
aVThere isn't a left or a right way of doing.
p185
aVBoris Johnson in London calls himself an anarcho-Tory.
p186
aVStrange term, but in some ways, he is.
p187
aVHe's a libertarian. He's an anarchist.
p188
aVHe rides to work on a bike,
p189
aVbut at the same time, he's in some ways a conservative.
p190
aVBloomberg in New York was a Democrat,
p191
aVthen he was a Republican,
p192
aVand finally he was an Independent, and said
p193
aVthe party label just gets in the way.
p194
aVLuzhkov, 20 years mayor in Moscow,
p195
aVthough he helped found a party, United Party with Putin,
p196
aVin fact refused to be defined by the party
p197
aVand finally, in fact, lost his job not under Brezhnev,
p198
aVnot under Gorbachev, but under Putin,
p199
aVwho wanted a more faithful party follower.
p200
aVSo mayors are pragmatists and problem-solvers.
p201
aVThey get things done.
p202
aa(lp203
VBut the second thing about mayors
p204
aVis they are also what I like to call homeboys,
p205
aVor to include the women mayors, homies.
p206
aVThey're from the neighborhood.
p207
aVThey're part of the neighborhood. They're known.
p208
aVEd Koch used to wander around New York City
p209
aVsaying, "How am I doing?"
p210
aVImagine David Cameron
p211
aVwandering around the United Kingdom
p212
aVasking, "How am I doing?" He wouldn't like the answer.
p213
aVOr Putin. Or any national leader.
p214
aVHe could ask that because he knew New Yorkers
p215
aVand they knew him.
p216
aVMayors are usually from the places they govern.
p217
aVIt's pretty hard to be a carpetbagger and be a mayor.
p218
aVYou can run for the Senate out of a different state,
p219
aVbut it's hard to do that as a mayor.
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd as a result, mayors and city councillors
p222
aVand local authorities
p223
aVhave a much higher trust level,
p224
aVand this is the third feature about mayors,
p225
aVthan national governing officials.
p226
aVIn the United States, we know the pathetic figures:
p227
aV18 percent of Americans approve of Congress
p228
aVand what they do.
p229
aVAnd even with a relatively popular president like Obama,
p230
aVthe figures for the Presidency run about 40, 45,
p231
aVsometimes 50 percent at best.
p232
aVThe Supreme Court has fallen way down from what it used to be.
p233
aVBut when you ask, "Do you trust your city councillor,
p234
aVdo you trust your mayor?"
p235
aVthe rates shoot up to 70, 75, even 80 percent,
p236
aVbecause they're from the neighborhood,
p237
aVbecause the people they work with are their neighbors,
p238
aVbecause, like Mayor Booker in Newark,
p239
aVa mayor is likely to get out of his car on the way to work
p240
aVand go in and pull people out of a burning building \u2014
p241
aVthat happened to Mayor Booker \u2014
p242
aVor intervene in a mugging in the street as he goes to work
p243
aVbecause he sees it.
p244
aVNo head of state would be permitted
p245
aVby their security details to do it,
p246
aVnor be in a position to do it.
p247
aa(lp248
VThat's the difference, and the difference
p249
aVhas to do with the character of cities themselves,
p250
aVbecause cities are profoundly multicultural,
p251
aVopen, participatory, democratic,
p252
aVable to work with one another.
p253
aa(lp254
VWhen states face each other,
p255
aVChina and the U.S., they face each other like this.
p256
aVWhen cities interact, they interact like this.
p257
aVChina and the U.S., despite the recent
p258
aVmeta-meeting in California,
p259
aVare locked in all kinds of anger, resentment, and rivalry
p260
aVfor number one.
p261
aVWe heard more about who will be number one.
p262
aVCities don't worry about number one.
p263
aVThey have to work together, and they do work together.
p264
aVThey work together in climate change, for example.
p265
aVOrganizations like the C40, like ICLEI, which I mentioned,
p266
aVhave been working together
p267
aVmany, many years before Copenhagen.
p268
aVIn Copenhagen, four or five years ago,
p269
aV184 nations came together to explain to one another
p270
aVwhy their sovereignty didn't permit them
p271
aVto deal with the grave, grave crisis of climate change,
p272
aVbut the mayor of Copenhagen had invited
p273
aV200 mayors to attend.
p274
aVThey came, they stayed, and they found ways
p275
aVand are still finding ways to work together,
p276
aVcity-to-city, and through inter-city organizations.
p277
aVEighty percent of carbon emissions come from cities,
p278
aVwhich means cities are in a position
p279
aVto solve the carbon problem, or most of it,
p280
aVwhether or not the states of which they are a part
p281
aVmake agreements with one another.
p282
aVAnd they are doing it.
p283
aVLos Angeles cleaned up its port,
p284
aVwhich was 40 percent of carbon emissions,
p285
aVand as a result got rid of about 20 percent of carbon.
p286
aVNew York has a program to upgrade its old buildings,
p287
aVmake them better insulated in the winter,
p288
aVto not leak energy in the summer,
p289
aVnot leak air conditioning. That's having an impact.
p290
aVBogota, where Mayor Mockus,
p291
aVwhen he was mayor, he introduced a transportation system
p292
aVthat saved energy, that allowed surface buses
p293
aVto run in effect like subways,
p294
aVexpress buses with corridors.
p295
aVIt helped unemployment, because people could get across town,
p296
aVand it had a profound impact on climate as well as
p297
aVmany other things there.
p298
aVSingapore, as it developed its high-rises
p299
aVand its remarkable public housing,
p300
aValso developed an island of parks,
p301
aVand if you go there, you'll see how much of it
p302
aVis green land and park land.
p303
aVCities are doing this, but not just one by one.
p304
aVThey are doing it together.
p305
aVThey are sharing what they do,
p306
aVand they are making a difference by shared best practices.
p307
aVBike shares, many of you have heard of it,
p308
aVstarted 20 or 30 years ago in Latin America.
p309
aVNow it's in hundreds of cities around the world.
p310
aVPedestrian zones, congestion fees,
p311
aVemission limits in cities like California cities have,
p312
aVthere's lots and lots that cities can do
p313
aVeven when opaque, stubborn nations refuse to act.
p314
aa(lp315
VSo what's the bottom line here?
p316
aVThe bottom line is, we still live politically
p317
aVin a world of borders, a world of boundaries,
p318
aVa world of walls,
p319
aVa world where states refuse to act together.
p320
aVYet we know that the reality we experience
p321
aVday to day is a world without borders,
p322
aVa world of diseases without borders
p323
aVand doctors without borders,
p324
aVmaladies sans frontières, Médecins Sans Frontières,
p325
aVof economics and technology without borders,
p326
aVof education without borders,
p327
aVof terrorism and war without borders.
p328
aVThat is the real world, and unless we find a way
p329
aVto globalize democracy or democratize globalization,
p330
aVwe will increasingly not only risk
p331
aVthe failure to address all of these transnational problems,
p332
aVbut we will risk losing democracy itself,
p333
aVlocked up in the old nation-state box,
p334
aVunable to address global problems democratically.
p335
aa(lp336
VSo where does that leave us?
p337
aVI'll tell you. The road to global democracy
p338
aVdoesn't run through states.
p339
aVIt runs through cities.
p340
aVDemocracy was born in the ancient polis.
p341
aVI believe it can be reborn in the global cosmopolis.
p342
aVIn that journey from polis to cosmopolis,
p343
aVwe can rediscover the power
p344
aVof democracy on a global level.
p345
aVWe can create not a League of Nations, which failed,
p346
aVbut a League of Cities,
p347
aVnot a United or a dis-United Nations,
p348
aVbut United Cities of the World.
p349
aVWe can create a global parliament of mayors.
p350
aVThat's an idea. It's in my conception of the coming world,
p351
aVbut it's also on the table in City Halls
p352
aVin Seoul, Korea, in Amsterdam,
p353
aVin Hamburg, and in New York.
p354
aVMayors are considering that idea of how you can actually
p355
aVconstitute a global parliament of mayors,
p356
aVand I love that idea, because a parliament of mayors
p357
aVis a parliament of citizens
p358
aVand a parliament of citizens is a parliament of us,
p359
aVof you and of me.
p360
aa(lp361
VIf ever there were citizens without borders,
p362
aVI think it's the citizens of TED
p363
aVwho show the promise to be those citizens without borders.
p364
aVI am ready to reach out and embrace
p365
aVa new global democracy,
p366
aVto take back our democracy.
p367
aVAnd the only question is,
p368
aVare you?
p369
aa(lp370
VThank you so much, my fellow citizens.
p371
