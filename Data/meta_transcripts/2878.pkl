VIt was the end of October in the mountains in Austria.
p4
aVI was there on a field trip with my architecture students from Zurich.
p5
aVAnd when we reached a high valley,
p6
aVI surprised them with the news that there was no hut
p7
aVor hotel booked for the night.
p8
aVIt was not a mistake.
p9
aVIt was totally on purpose.
p10
aVThe challenge was to build our own shelter with whatever we could find.
p11
aVAnd we all survived.
p12
aVIt was cold, it was really tough ...
p13
aVand it was a great learning experience
p14
aVto discover that there are a lot of resources given by nature for free,
p15
aVand all that we need is our sensitivity to see them ...
p16
aVand our creativity to use them.
p17
aa(lp18
VI found myself in a similar situation.
p19
aVWhen I was an architecture student about 13 years ago,
p20
aVI went to Bangladesh to a remote village called Rudrapur
p21
aVwith the aim to design and build a school as my thesis project.
p22
aVI had lived in that village before when I was 19 and a volunteer
p23
aVat Dipshikha, a Bangladeshi NGO for rural development.
p24
aVAnd what I had learned from them
p25
aVwas that the most sustainable strategy for sustainable development
p26
aVis to cherish and to use your very own resources and potential,
p27
aVand not get dependent on external factors.
p28
aVAnd this is what I tried to do with my architecture as well.
p29
aa(lp30
VIn terms of suitable building materials for my school,
p31
aVI didn't have to look far.
p32
aVThey were right under my feet:
p33
aVmud, earth, dirt, clay, however you call it ...
p34
aVand bamboo that was growing all around.
p35
aVElectricity in remote Bangladesh is rare,
p36
aVbut we didn't need it.
p37
aVWe had human energy
p38
aVand the people were happy to have the work.
p39
aVTools were an issue, too,
p40
aVbut we had these guys,
p41
aVwater buffalos.
p42
aVWe had also tried a bit cows,
p43
aVbut interestingly, they were too intelligent.
p44
aVThey were always stepping in the holes of the previous round.
p45
aVThey wouldn't mix the mud, the straw \u2014
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
Vthe sand, which are the ingredients in the walls.
p50
aVAnd except a small team of consultants
p51
aVlike my partner for realization, Eike Roswag,
p52
aVand my basket-weaver cousin, Emmanuel,
p53
aVit was all built by craftsmen from the village.
p54
aVAnd this is the METI school after six months of construction.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Applause)
p57
aa(lp58
VThank you.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Applause)
p61
aa(lp62
VLoad-bearing earth walls that really ground the school,
p63
aVand large bamboo structures that bring the lightness in.
p64
aVThat's the classroom on the ground floor.
p65
aVAttached to it are the caves.
p66
aVThey're for reading, for snuggling, for solo work,
p67
aVfor meditation, for playing ...
p68
aVand the classroom on the top.
p69
aa(lp70
VThe children all signed with their names in Bengali the doors,
p71
aVand they did not only sign, they also helped building the school.
p72
aVAnd I'm sure you all had your hands in mud or clay before.
p73
aVIt's wonderful to touch. I love it.
p74
aVThe children loved it.
p75
aVAnd can you imagine the feeling of a small boy or a girl
p76
aVor an illiterate day laborer standing in front of that school building
p77
aVand knowing that you built this
p78
aVout of the ordinary bamboo and just the dirt underneath your feet,
p79
aVusing nothing but your hands?
p80
aVThat gives such an enormous boost of trust and confidence
p81
aVin yourself and the community.
p82
aa(lp83
VAnd in the material.
p84
aVEspecially mud has a very poor image.
p85
aVWhen we think of mud, we think of dirt \u2014
p86
aVit's ugly, it's nondurable \u2014
p87
aVand this is the image I want to change.
p88
aVIn fact, it's the 11th rainy season for this school now,
p89
aVreally harsh, horizontal monsoon rains,
p90
aVand the walls are standing strong.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Applause)
p93
aa(lp94
VSo how does it work?
p95
aVFirst rule, a good foundation that keeps the wall dry from the ground,
p96
aVand second rule, a good roof that protects from the top,
p97
aVand third rule, erosion control.
p98
aVMud walls need speed breakers
p99
aVso that the rainwater cannot run down the wall fast,
p100
aVand these speed breakers could be lines of bamboo
p101
aVor stones or straw mixed into the mud,
p102
aVjust like a hill needs trees or rocks in order to prevent erosion.
p103
aVIt works just the same way.
p104
aVAnd people always ask me if I have to add cement to the mud,
p105
aVand the answer is no.
p106
aVThere is no stabilizer, no coating on these walls,
p107
aVonly in the foundation.
p108
aVSo this is the close-up of the wall
p109
aVafter 10 rainy seasons,
p110
aVand as much as I grew a bit older,
p111
aVthe wall got some wrinkles as well.
p112
aVThe edges my not be as sharp as before,
p113
aVbut it still looks pretty good,
p114
aVand if it needs repairing,
p115
aVit is really easy to do.
p116
aVYou just take the broken part,
p117
aVmake it wet, and put it back on the wall,
p118
aVand it will look the same as before.
p119
aVWish that would work on me, too.
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VYeah, and the great thing is,
p124
aVif an earth wall is not needed anymore,
p125
aVit can go back to the ground it came from,
p126
aVturn into a garden,
p127
aVor get fully recycled without any loss of quality.
p128
aVThere's no other material that can do this,
p129
aVand this is why mud is so excellent in terms of environmental performance.
p130
aa(lp131
VWhat about the economic sustainability?
p132
aVWhen we built the school,
p133
aVI practically lived on the construction site,
p134
aVand in the evening, I used to go with the workers to the market,
p135
aVand I could see how they spent their money.
p136
aVAnd they would buy the vegetables from their neighbors,
p137
aVthey would get a new haircut or a new blouse from the tailor.
p138
aVAnd because the main part of the building budget
p139
aVwas spent on craftsmanship,
p140
aVthe school wasn't just a building,
p141
aVit became a real catalyst for local development,
p142
aVand that made me happy.
p143
aVIf I had designed the school in cement and steel,
p144
aVthis money would have been exported and lost for those families.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Applause)
p147
aa(lp148
VThe building budget at that time was 35,000 euros \u2014
p149
aVit's probably doubled by now \u2014
p150
aVand this is a lot of money for that region,
p151
aVand especially because this money is working within the community
p152
aVand rotating fast,
p153
aVand not on the stock market.
p154
aVSo when it comes to the economic sustainability of my project,
p155
aVmy main question is, who gets the profit?
p156
aa(lp157
VHow many of you in here
p158
aVhave some experience living in a mud house?
p159
aVChris Anderson, where is your hand?
p160
aa(lp161
V(Laughter)
p162
aa(lp163
VYou? OK.
p164
aa(lp165
VYeah.
p166
aVIt seems totally out of our focus,
p167
aVbut approximately three billion people all around the planet
p168
aVare living in earth houses,
p169
aVand it is a traditional building material
p170
aVin Europe just as much as in Africa.
p171
aa(lp172
VStrangely enough,
p173
aVmud is not considered worthy of being studied at universities ...
p174
aVso I brought the dirt to Harvard,
p175
aa(lp176
V(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
Vprecisely 60 tons of dirt right in front of the main facade
p179
aVof the Graduate School of Design.
p180
aVStudents and faculty rolled up their sleeves,
p181
aVgot their hands dirty
p182
aVand transformed the front into a warm place for people to gather.
p183
aVChildren would climb the structures,
p184
aVskaters would ride the ramp,
p185
aVstudents having lunch breaks,
p186
aVand it was particularly fascinating to see how many people were touching the wall,
p187
aVand we usually don't go around cities caressing our facades, right?
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VOf course, this was a small-scale project,
p194
aVbut in terms of awareness-building and in terms of education,
p195
aVit was like an acupuncture trigger point.
p196
aVAnd in fact, in more and more countries,
p197
aVload-bearing earthen structures are not allowed to be built anymore
p198
aValthough they're traditional and have lasted for hundreds of years,
p199
aVand not because the material is weak,
p200
aVbut because there are no architects and engineers
p201
aVwho know how to deal with that material.
p202
aVSo education on all levels,
p203
aVfor craftsmen, engineers and architects,
p204
aVis really strongly needed.
p205
aVEqually important is technological development,
p206
aVlike prefabrication developed by my colleague Martin Rauch,
p207
aVwho is an Austrian artist and expert in earthen structures.
p208
aVAnd he has created technologies for rammed earth elements,
p209
aVfor prefabrication of rammed earth elements
p210
aVthat include insulation, wall heatings and coolings
p211
aVand all sorts of electrical fittings
p212
aVthat can be layered to multistoried buildings,
p213
aVand this is important in order to scale up
p214
aVand in order to fasten up the processes,
p215
aVlike in the Ricola Herb Center in Switzerland.
p216
aa(lp217
VAnd finally, we need good built projects
p218
aVthat prove you can build with an ancient material
p219
aVin a very modern way.
p220
aVIt is not a matter of how old a material is;
p221
aVit's a matter of our creative ability to use it today.
p222
aVThese, for example, are three hostels
p223
aVthat I did in China in the village Baoxi,
p224
aVabout six hours by bus from Shanghai.
p225
aVThe outside shape is woven bamboo,
p226
aVand the inside core is stones and rammed earth.
p227
aVAnd it is a traditional building material.
p228
aVEven large parts of the Great Wall of China
p229
aVhave been built with rammed earth,
p230
aVbut it's getting replaced by concrete.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd this trend is happening very fast.
p233
aVWithin only a couple of years,
p234
aVChina has consumed more cement than the United States
p235
aVin the entire 20th century.
p236
aVAnd this trend of replacing natural building materials
p237
aVwith materials that require a lot of energy,
p238
aVthat are energy-intensive,
p239
aVand that emit CO2
p240
aVis really clearly contributing to climate change.
p241
aVAnd we have alternatives,
p242
aVsuch as mud, stones, timber, bamboo, earth,
p243
aVthat are totally effective options for all sorts of purposes.
p244
aa(lp245
VThis, for example, is an office building that we did
p246
aVfor Omicron Electronics in Austria.
p247
aVMud is healthy for the planet, but also for the human bodies,
p248
aVand the material is low-tech,
p249
aVbut the performance is high-tech.
p250
aVThe earth walls keep the highly sophisticated tools in the building safe
p251
aVby naturally regulating moisture.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd this wall in my own home
p254
aVis our humidfier.
p255
aVWe love our six tons of dirt at home
p256
aVnot only because it's healthy and sustainable.
p257
aVIts archaic warmth is touching deep within.
p258
aa(lp259
VMy personal dream is to build a mud skyscraper right in Manhattan.
p260
aa(lp261
V(Laughter)
p262
aa(lp263
VYeah.
p264
aa(lp265
V(Applause)
p266
aa(lp267
VAnd this dream isn't so crazy
p268
aVif you think of the mud city of Shibam in Yemen
p269
aVthat was built in the 16th century
p270
aVand has lasted now for 500 years.
p271
aVWhat was possible that long ago is possible today as well,
p272
aVand we can apply all our technical know-how
p273
aVto these ancient materials
p274
aVso that it meets our needs and our dreams.
p275
aa(lp276
VAll around us,
p277
aVand just below our feet ...
p278
aVare wonderful natural building materials.
p279
aVLet's use them.
p280
aVAnd I deeply believe
p281
aVour homes, our work spaces, our cities
p282
aVwould become more healthy and sustainable
p283
aVand more humane
p284
aVand beautiful.
p285

VThank you.
