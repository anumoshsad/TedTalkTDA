VMountain biking in Israel
p4
aVis something that I do with great passion
p5
aVand commitment.
p6
aVAnd when I'm on my bike,
p7
aVI feel that I connect
p8
aVwith the profound beauty of Israel,
p9
aVand I feel that I'm united
p10
aVwith this country's history
p11
aVand biblical law.
p12
aVAnd also, for me,
p13
aVbiking is a matter of empowerment.
p14
aVWhen I reach the summit
p15
aVof a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere,
p16
aVI feel young,
p17
aVinvincible, eternal.
p18
aVIt's as if I'm connecting with some legacy
p19
aVor with some energy
p20
aVfar greater than myself.
p21
aVYou can see my fellow riders
p22
aVat the end of the picture,
p23
aVlooking at me with some concern.
p24
aVAnd here is another picture of them.
p25
aVUnfortunately, I cannot show their faces,
p26
aVneither can I disclose their true names,
p27
aVand that's because my fellow riders
p28
aVare juvenile inmates,
p29
aVoffenders
p30
aVspending time in a correction facility
p31
aVabout 20 minutes' ride from here \u2014
p32
aVwell, like everything in Israel.
p33
aVAnd I've been riding with these kids once a week,
p34
aVevery Tuesday, rain or shine, for the last four years
p35
aVand by now, they've become a very big part of my life.
p36
aa(lp37
VThis story began four years ago.
p38
aVThe correction facility where they are locked up
p39
aVhappens to be right in the middle
p40
aVof one of my usual trips,
p41
aVand it's surrounded by barbed wires
p42
aVand electric gates and armed guards.
p43
aVSo on one of these rides,
p44
aVI talked my way into the compound
p45
aVand went to see the warden.
p46
aVI told the warden
p47
aVthat I wanted to start a mountain biking club in this place
p48
aVand that basically I wanted to take the kids
p49
aVfrom here to there.
p50
aVAnd I told him, "Let's find a way
p51
aVin which I'll be able to take out 10 kids once a week
p52
aVto ride with in the summer in the country."
p53
aVAnd the warden was quite amused,
p54
aVand he told me he thought that I was a nut
p55
aVand he told me,
p56
aV"This place is a correction facility. These guys are serious offenders.
p57
aVThey are supposed to be locked up.
p58
aVThey aren't supposed to be out at large."
p59
aVAnd yet, we began to talk about it,
p60
aVand one thing led to another.
p61
aVAnd I can't see myself
p62
aVgoing into a state prison in New Jersey
p63
aVand making such a proposition,
p64
aVbut this being Israel,
p65
aVthe warden somehow made it happen.
p66
aVAnd so two months later,
p67
aVwe found ourselves "at large" \u2014
p68
aVmyself,
p69
aV10 juvenile inmates
p70
aVand a wonderful fellow named Russ,
p71
aVwho became a very good friend of mine
p72
aVand my partner in this project.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd in the next few weeks, I had the tremendous pleasure
p75
aVof introducing these kids
p76
aVto the world of total freedom,
p77
aVa world consisting of magnificent vistas
p78
aVlike these \u2014
p79
aVeverything you see here is obviously in Israel \u2014
p80
aVas well as close encounters
p81
aVwith all sorts of small creatures
p82
aVcoming in all sorts of sizes,
p83
aVcolors, shapes, forms
p84
aVand so on.
p85
aVIn spite of all this splendor,
p86
aVthe beginning was extremely frustrating.
p87
aVEvery small obstacle,
p88
aVevery slight uphill,
p89
aVwould cause these fellows
p90
aVto stop in their tracks and give up.
p91
aVSo we had a lot of this going on.
p92
aVI found out that they had a very hard time
p93
aVdealing with frustration and difficulties \u2014
p94
aVnot because they were physically unfit.
p95
aVBut that's one reason why they ended up where they were.
p96
aVAnd I became increasingly more and more agitated,
p97
aVbecause I was there
p98
aVnot only to be with them,
p99
aVbut also to ride and create a team
p100
aVand I didn't know what to do.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, let me give you an example.
p103
aVWe're going downhill in some rocky terrain,
p104
aVand the front tire of Alex
p105
aVgets caught in one of these crevasses here.
p106
aVSo he crashes down,
p107
aVand he gets slightly injured,
p108
aVbut this does not prevent him from jumping up
p109
aVand then starting to jump up and down on his bike
p110
aVand curse violently.
p111
aVThen he throws his helmet in the air.
p112
aVHis backpack goes ballistic in some other direction.
p113
aVAnd then he runs to the nearest tree
p114
aVand starts to break branches and throw rocks
p115
aVand curse like I've never heard.
p116
aVAnd I'm just standing there,
p117
aVwatching this scene
p118
aVwith a complete disbelief,
p119
aVnot knowing what to do.
p120
aVI'm used to algorithms
p121
aVand data structures
p122
aVand super motivated students,
p123
aVand nothing in my background
p124
aVprepared me to deal
p125
aVwith a raging, violent adolescent
p126
aVin the middle of nowhere.
p127
aVAnd you have to realize that these incidents
p128
aVdid not happen in convenient locations.
p129
aVThey happened in places like this,
p130
aVin the Judean Desert,
p131
aV20 kilometers away from the nearest road.
p132
aVAnd what you don't see in this picture
p133
aVis that somewhere between these riders there,
p134
aVthere's a teenager sitting on a rock,
p135
aVsaying, "I'm not moving from here. Forget it.
p136
aVI've had it."
p137
aVWell, that's a problem
p138
aVbecause one way or another, you have to get this guy moving
p139
aVbecause it's getting dark soon and dangerous.
p140
aa(lp141
VIt took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do.
p142
aVAt the beginning, it was a disaster.
p143
aVI tried harsh words and threats
p144
aVand they took me nowhere.
p145
aVThat's what they had all their lives.
p146
aVAnd at some point I found out,
p147
aVwhen a kid like this gets into a fit,
p148
aVthe best thing that you can possibly do
p149
aVis stay as close as possible to this kid,
p150
aVwhich is difficult,
p151
aVbecause what you really want to do is go away.
p152
aVBut that's what he had all his life,
p153
aVpeople walking away from him.
p154
aVSo what you have to do is stay close
p155
aVand try to reach in
p156
aVand pet his shoulder
p157
aVor give him a piece of chocolate.
p158
aVSo I would say, "Alex, I know that it's terribly difficult.
p159
aVWhy don't you rest for a few minutes
p160
aVand then we'll go on."
p161
aV"Go away you maniac-psychopath.
p162
aVWhy would you bring us to this goddamn place?"
p163
aVAnd I would say, "Relax, Alex.
p164
aVHere's a piece of chocolate."
p165
aVAnd Alex would go, "Arrrrggg!"
p166
aVBecause you have to understand
p167
aVthat on these rides we are constantly hungry \u2014
p168
aVand after the rides also.
p169
aa(lp170
VAnd who is this guy, Alex, to begin with?
p171
aVHe's a 17-year-old.
p172
aVWhen he was eight,
p173
aVsomeone put him on a boat in Odessa
p174
aVand sent him, shipped him to Israel
p175
aVon his own.
p176
aVAnd he ended up in south Tel Aviv
p177
aVand did not have the good luck
p178
aVto be picked up by a [unclear]
p179
aVand roamed the streets
p180
aVand became a prominent gang member.
p181
aVAnd he spent the last 10 years of his life
p182
aVin two places only,
p183
aVthe slums and the state prison,
p184
aVwhere he spent the last two years
p185
aVbefore he ended up sitting on this rock there.
p186
aVAnd so this kid
p187
aVwas probably abused,
p188
aVabandoned, ignored, betrayed
p189
aVby almost every adult along the way.
p190
aVSo, for such a kid,
p191
aVwhen an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him
p192
aVand doesn't walk away from him
p193
aVin any situation,
p194
aVirrespective of how he behaves,
p195
aVit's a tremendous healing experience.
p196
aVIt's an act of unconditional acceptance,
p197
aVsomething that he never had.
p198
aa(lp199
VI want to say a few words about vision.
p200
aVWhen I started this program four years ago,
p201
aVI had this original plan
p202
aVof creating a team
p203
aVof winning underdogs.
p204
aVI had an image of Lance Armstrong
p205
aVin my mind.
p206
aVAnd it took me exactly two months
p207
aVof complete frustration
p208
aVto realize that this vision
p209
aVwas misplaced,
p210
aVand that there was another vision
p211
aVsupremely more important
p212
aVand more readily available.
p213
aVIt all of a sudden dawned on me, in this project,
p214
aVthat the purpose of these rides
p215
aVshould actually be
p216
aVto expose the kids
p217
aVto one thing only: love.
p218
aVLove to the country, to the uphill
p219
aVand the downhill,
p220
aVto all the incredible creatures that surround us \u2014
p221
aVthe animals, the plants,
p222
aVthe insects \u2014
p223
aVlove and respect
p224
aVto other fellow members in your team,
p225
aVin your biking team,
p226
aVand most importantly,
p227
aVlove and respect to yourself,
p228
aVwhich is something
p229
aVthat they badly miss.
p230
aa(lp231
VTogether with the kids,
p232
aVI also went through a remarkable transformation.
p233
aVNow, I come from a cutthroat world
p234
aVof science and high technology.
p235
aVI used to think that reason and logic
p236
aVand relentless drive
p237
aVwere the only ways to make things happen.
p238
aVAnd before I worked with the kids,
p239
aVanything that I did with them,
p240
aVor anything that I did with myself,
p241
aVwas supposed to be perfect,
p242
aVideal, optimal,
p243
aVbut after working with them for some time,
p244
aVI discovered the great virtues of empathy
p245
aVand flexibility
p246
aVand being able to start with some vision,
p247
aVand if the vision doesn't work, well nothing happened.
p248
aVAll you have to do is play with it, change it a little bit,
p249
aVand come up with something that does help, that does work.
p250
aVSo right now, I feel more
p251
aVlike these are my principles,
p252
aVand if you don't like them,
p253
aVI have others.
p254
aa(lp255
V(Laughter)
p256
aa(lp257
V(Applause)
p258
aa(lp259
VAnd one of these principles
p260
aVis focus.
p261
aVBefore each ride
p262
aVwe sit together with the kids,
p263
aVand we give them one word
p264
aVto think about during the ride.
p265
aVYou have to focus their attention on something
p266
aVbecause so many things happen.
p267
aVSo these are words like "teamwork"
p268
aVor "endurance"
p269
aVor even complicated concepts
p270
aVlike "resource allocation"
p271
aVor "perspective," a word that they don't understand.
p272
aVYou know, perspective
p273
aVis one of these critically important
p274
aVlife-coping strategies
p275
aVthat mountain biking can really teach you.
p276
aVI tell kids
p277
aVwhen they struggle through some uphill
p278
aVand feel like they cannot take it anymore,
p279
aVit really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles
p280
aVand raise your head and look around
p281
aVand see how the vista around you grows.
p282
aVIt literally propels you upwards.
p283
aVThat's what perspective is all about.
p284
aVOr you can also look back in time
p285
aVand realize that you've already conquered
p286
aVsteeper mountains before.
p287
aVAnd that's how they develop self-esteem.
p288
aa(lp289
VNow, let me give you an example of how it works.
p290
aVYou stand with your bike at the beginning of February.
p291
aVIt's very cold, and you're standing in one of these rainy days,
p292
aVand it's drizzling
p293
aVand cold and chilly,
p294
aVand you're standing in, let's say, Yokneam.
p295
aVAnd you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds
p296
aVyou see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka \u2014
p297
aVthat's where you're supposed to climb now \u2014
p298
aVand you say, "There's no way that I could possibly get there."
p299
aVAnd yet, two hours later
p300
aVyou find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery,
p301
aVsmeared with mud,
p302
aVblood and sweat.
p303
aVAnd you look down at Yokneam;
p304
aVeverything is so small and tiny.
p305
aVAnd you say, "Hey, Alex. Look at this parking lot where we started.
p306
aVIt's that big.
p307
aVI can't believe that I did it."
p308
aVAnd that's the point
p309
aVwhen you start loving yourself.
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd so we talked about
p312
aVthese special words that we teach them.
p313
aVAnd at the end of each ride, we sit together
p314
aVand share moments
p315
aVin which those special words of the day
p316
aVpopped up and made a difference,
p317
aVand these discussions
p318
aVcan be extremely inspiring.
p319
aVIn one of them, one of the kids once said,
p320
aV"When we were riding on this ridge
p321
aVoverlooking the Dead Sea \u2014
p322
aVand he's talking about this spot here \u2014
p323
aV"I was reminded
p324
aVof the day when I left my village in Ethiopia
p325
aVand went away together with my brother.
p326
aVWe walked 120 kilometers
p327
aVuntil we reached Sudan.
p328
aVThis was the first place where we got some water and supplies."
p329
aVAnd he goes on saying, and everyone looks at him like a hero,
p330
aVprobably for the first time in his life.
p331
aVAnd he says \u2014 because I also have volunteers riding with me,
p332
aVadults, who are sitting there
p333
aVlistening to him \u2014
p334
aVand he says, "And this was just the beginning
p335
aVof our ordeal
p336
aVuntil we ended up in Israel.
p337
aVAnd only now," he says,
p338
aV"I'm beginning to understand where I am,
p339
aVand I actually like it."
p340
aVNow I remember, when he said it,
p341
aVI felt goosebumps on my body,
p342
aVbecause he said it overlooking the Moab Mountains here in the background.
p343
aVThat's where Joshua descended
p344
aVand crossed the Jordan
p345
aVand led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan
p346
aV3,000 years ago
p347
aVin this final leg
p348
aVof the journey from Africa.
p349
aa(lp350
VAnd so, perspective
p351
aVand context and history
p352
aVplay key roles
p353
aVin the way I plan my rides
p354
aVwith the kids.
p355
aVWe visit Kibbutzim
p356
aVthat were established by Holocaust survivors.
p357
aVWe explore ruins
p358
aVof Palestinian villages,
p359
aVand we discuss how they became ruins.
p360
aVAnd we go through numerous remnants
p361
aVof Jewish settlements, Nabatic settlements,
p362
aVCanaanite settlements \u2014
p363
aVthree-, four, five-thousand years old.
p364
aVAnd through this tapestry,
p365
aVwhich is the history of this country,
p366
aVthe kids acquire
p367
aVwhat is probably the most important
p368
aVvalue in education,
p369
aVand that is the understanding that life is complex,
p370
aVand there's no black and white.
p371
aVAnd by appreciating complexity,
p372
aVthey become more tolerant,
p373
aVand tolerance leads to hope.
p374
aa(lp375
VI ride with these kids once a week,
p376
aVevery Tuesday.
p377
aVHere's a picture I took last Tuesday \u2014 less than a week ago \u2014
p378
aVand I ride with them tomorrow also.
p379
aVIn every one of these rides
p380
aVI always end up standing in one of these incredible locations,
p381
aVtaking in this incredible landscape around me,
p382
aVand I feel blessed and fortunate
p383
aVthat I'm alive,
p384
aVand that I sense every fiber
p385
aVin my aching body.
p386
aVAnd I feel blessed and fortunate
p387
aVthat 15 years ago
p388
aVI had the courage to resign
p389
aVmy tenured position at NYU
p390
aVand return to my home country
p391
aVwhere I can do these incredible rides
p392
aVwith this group of troubled kids
p393
aVcoming from Ethiopia
p394
aVand Morocco and Russia.
p395
aVAnd I feel blessed and fortunate
p396
aVthat every week, every Tuesday \u2014
p397
aVand actually every Friday also \u2014
p398
aVI can once again celebrate
p399
aVin the marrow of my bones
p400
aVthe very essence of living in Israel on the edge.
p401
