VI have had the distinct blessing in my life
p4
aVto have worked on a bunch of amazing projects.
p5
aVBut the coolest I ever worked on
p6
aVwas around this guy.
p7
aVThis guy's name is TEMPT.
p8
aVTEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s.
p9
aVAnd he came up home from a run one day
p10
aVand said, "Dad, my legs are tingling."
p11
aVAnd that was the onset of ALS.
p12
aVSo TEMPT is now completely paralyzed.
p13
aVHe only has use of his eyes.
p14
aa(lp15
VI was exposed to him.
p16
aVI have a company that does design and animation,
p17
aVso obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part
p18
aVof what we admire and respect in the art world.
p19
aVAnd so we decided that we were going to sponsor
p20
aVTony, TEMPT, and his cause.
p21
aVSo I went and met with his brother and father
p22
aVand said, "We're going to give you this money.
p23
aVWhat are you going to do with it?"
p24
aVAnd his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
p25
aVI just want to be able to communicate with him
p26
aVand him to be able to communicate with me."
p27
aVAnd I said, "Wait a second, isn't that \u2014 I've seen Stephen Hawking \u2014
p28
aVdon't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate
p29
aVvia these devices?"
p30
aVAnd he said, "No, unless you're in the upper echelon and
p31
aVyou've got really amazing insurance,
p32
aVyou can't actually do that.
p33
aVThese devices aren't accessible to people."
p34
aVAnd I said, "Well, how do you actually communicate?"
p35
aVHas everyone seen the movie "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly?"
p36
aVThat's how they communicate \u2014
p37
aVso run their finger along.
p38
aVI said, "That's archaic. How can that be?"
p39
aa(lp40
VSo I showed up with the desire to just write a check,
p41
aVand instead, I wrote a check
p42
aVthat I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash.
p43
aVI committed to his brother and his father right then and there \u2014
p44
aVI'm like, "All right, here's the deal:
p45
aVTony's going to speak, we're going to get him a machine,
p46
aVand we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again.
p47
aVBecause it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him
p48
aVisn't able to communicate it."
p49
aa(lp50
VSo I spoke at a conference a couple months after that.
p51
aVI met these guys called GRL,
p52
aVGraffiti Research Lab,
p53
aVand they have a technology
p54
aVthat allows them to project a light onto any surface
p55
aVand then, with a laser pointer, draw on it,
p56
aVand it just registers the negative space.
p57
aVSo they go around and do art installations like this.
p58
aVAll the things that go up there, they said there's a life cycle.
p59
aVFirst it starts with the sexual organs,
p60
aVthen it starts with cuss words,
p61
aVthen it was Bush slanders
p62
aVand then people actually got to art.
p63
aVBut there was always a life cycle to their presentations.
p64
aVSo I went home and was having dinner with my wife
p65
aVand was telling her about this,
p66
aVand we were like, "Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists
p67
aVwhere you can use your eyes to control things,
p68
aVwhy don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser
p69
aVand he could do graf again? Well that would be awesome."
p70
aa(lp71
VSo that started the journey.
p72
aVAnd about two years later, about a year later,
p73
aVafter a bunch of organization
p74
aVand a bunch of moving things around,
p75
aVwe'd accomplished a couple things.
p76
aVOne, we battered down the doors of the insurance companies,
p77
aVand we actually got TEMPT a machine
p78
aVthat let him communicate \u2014 a Stephen Hawking machine.
p79
aV(Applause)
p80
aVWhich was awesome.
p81
aVAnd he's seriously one of the funniest \u2014 I call him Yoda,
p82
aVbecause you talk to the guy, you get an email from him,
p83
aVand you're like, "I'm not worthy. This guy's so amazing."
p84
aa(lp85
VThe other thing we did
p86
aVis we flew seven programmers from all over the world \u2014
p87
aVliterally every corner of the world \u2014
p88
aVinto our house.
p89
aVMy wife and kids and I moved to our back garage,
p90
aVand these hackers and programmers
p91
aVand conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house.
p92
aVA lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that
p93
aVand that we were going to come back
p94
aVand all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls.
p95
aVBut for over two weeks,
p96
aVwe programmed,
p97
aVwe went to the Venice boardwalk,
p98
aVmy kids got involved,
p99
aVmy dog got involved,
p100
aVand we created this.
p101
aa(lp102
VThis is called the EyeWriter,
p103
aVand you can see the description.
p104
aVThis is a cheap pair of sunglasses
p105
aVthat we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk,
p106
aVsome copper wire
p107
aVand some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack.
p108
aVWe took a PS3 camera, hacked it open,
p109
aVmounted it to an LED light,
p110
aVand now there's a device that is free \u2014
p111
aVyou build this yourself, we publish the code for free,
p112
aVyou download the software for free.
p113
aVAnd now we've created a device
p114
aVthat has absolutely no limitations.
p115
aVThere's no insurance company that can say "No."
p116
aVThere's no hospital that can say "No."
p117
aVAnybody who's paralyzed now has access
p118
aVto actually draw or communicate using only their eyes.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Applause)
p121
aa(lp122
VThank you.
p123
aVThank you guys very much. That was awesome.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo at the end of the two weeks,
p126
aVwe went back to TEMPT's room.
p127
aVI love this picture, because this is someone else's room
p128
aVand that's his room.
p129
aVSo there's all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling.
p130
aVAnd after over a year of planning,
p131
aVtwo weeks of programming,
p132
aVcarb-fest and all-night sessions,
p133
aVTony drew again for the first time in seven years.
p134
aVAnd this is an amazing picture,
p135
aVbecause this is his life support system,
p136
aVand he's looking over his life support system.
p137
aVWe kicked his bed so that he could see out.
p138
aVAnd we set up a projector
p139
aVon a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital.
p140
aVAnd he drew again for the first time,
p141
aVin front of his family and friends \u2014
p142
aVand you can only imagine
p143
aVwhat the feeling in the parking lot was.
p144
aVThe funny thing was, we had to break into the parking lot too,
p145
aVso we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VSo at the end of this, he sent us an email,
p150
aVand this is what the email said:
p151
aV"That was the first time I've drawn anything for seven years.
p152
aVI feel like I had been held underwater,
p153
aVand someone finally reached down
p154
aVand pulled my head up so I could breathe."
p155
aVIsn't that awesome?
p156
aa(lp157
V(Applause)
p158
aa(lp159
VSo that's kind of our battle cry.
p160
aVThat's what keeps us going and keeps us developing.
p161
aVAnd we've got such a long way to go with this.
p162
aVThis is an amazing device,
p163
aVbut it's the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch.
p164
aVAnd someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more.
p165
aVSo we're in the process of trying to figure out
p166
aVhow to make it better, faster, stronger.
p167
aa(lp168
VSince that time, we've had all kinds of acknowledgment.
p169
aVWe've won a bunch of awards.
p170
aVRemember, it's free; none of us are making any money on this thing.
p171
aVIt's all coming out of our own pockets.
p172
aVSo the awards were like, "Oh, this is fantastic."
p173
aVArmstrong Twittered about us,
p174
aVand then in December, Time magazine honored us
p175
aVas one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, which was really cool.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Applause)
p178
aa(lp179
VThe coolest thing about this \u2014
p180
aVand this is what's completing the whole circle \u2014
p181
aVis that in April of this year,
p182
aVat the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles,
p183
aVthere's going to be an exhibition called "Art of the Streets."
p184
aVAnd "Art of the Streets" is going to have
p185
aVpretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene \u2014
p186
aVBanksy, Shepard Fairey, KAWS \u2014
p187
aVall of these guys will be there.
p188
aVTEMPT's going to be in the show,
p189
aVwhich is pretty awesome.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Applause)
p192
aa(lp193
VSo basically this is my point:
p194
aVIf you see something that's not possible,
p195
aVmake it possible.
p196
aVEverything in this room wasn't possible \u2014
p197
aVthis stage, this computer, this mic, the EyeWriter \u2014
p198
aVwasn't possible at one point.
p199
aVMake it possible, everyone in this room.
p200
aVI'm not a programmer,
p201
aVnever done anything with ocular recognition technology,
p202
aVbut I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people
p203
aVso that we could make something happen.
p204
aVAnd this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself
p205
aVevery single day
p206
aVwhen you come up with something you feel that needs to be done:
p207
aVif not now, then when? And if not me, then who?
p208
aa(lp209
VThank you guys.
