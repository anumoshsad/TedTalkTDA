(lp3
VOkay, now I don't want to alarm anybody in this room,
p4
aVbut it's just come to my attention that the person to your right is a liar.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VAlso, the person to your left is a liar.
p9
aVAlso the person sitting in your very seats is a liar.
p10
aVWe're all liars.
p11
aVWhat I'm going to do today
p12
aVis I'm going to show you what the research says about why we're all liars,
p13
aVhow you can become a liespotter
p14
aVand why you might want to go the extra mile
p15
aVand go from liespotting to truth seeking,
p16
aVand ultimately to trust building.
p17
aa(lp18
VNow, speaking of trust,
p19
aVever since I wrote this book, "Liespotting,"
p20
aVno one wants to meet me in person anymore, no, no, no, no, no.
p21
aVThey say, "It's okay, we'll email you."
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VI can't even get a coffee date at Starbucks.
p26
aVMy husband's like, "Honey, deception?
p27
aVMaybe you could have focused on cooking. How about French cooking?"
p28
aa(lp29
VSo before I get started, what I'm going to do
p30
aVis I'm going to clarify my goal for you,
p31
aVwhich is not to teach a game of Gotcha.
p32
aVLiespotters aren't those nitpicky kids,
p33
aVthose kids in the back of the room that are shouting, "Gotcha! Gotcha!
p34
aVYour eyebrow twitched. You flared your nostril.
p35
aVI watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.' I know you're lying."
p36
aVNo, liespotters are armed
p37
aVwith scientific knowledge of how to spot deception.
p38
aVThey use it to get to the truth,
p39
aVand they do what mature leaders do everyday;
p40
aVthey have difficult conversations with difficult people,
p41
aVsometimes during very difficult times.
p42
aVAnd they start up that path by accepting a core proposition,
p43
aVand that proposition is the following:
p44
aVLying is a cooperative act.
p45
aVThink about it, a lie has no power whatsoever by its mere utterance.
p46
aVIts power emerges
p47
aVwhen someone else agrees to believe the lie.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo I know it may sound like tough love,
p50
aVbut look, if at some point you got lied to,
p51
aVit's because you agreed to get lied to.
p52
aVTruth number one about lying: Lying's a cooperative act.
p53
aVNow not all lies are harmful.
p54
aVSometimes we're willing participants in deception
p55
aVfor the sake of social dignity,
p56
aVmaybe to keep a secret that should be kept secret, secret.
p57
aVWe say, "Nice song."
p58
aV"Honey, you don't look fat in that, no."
p59
aVOr we say, favorite of the digiratti,
p60
aV"You know, I just fished that email out of my Spam folder.
p61
aVSo sorry."
p62
aa(lp63
VBut there are times when we are unwilling participants in deception.
p64
aVAnd that can have dramatic costs for us.
p65
aVLast year saw 997 billion dollars
p66
aVin corporate fraud alone in the United States.
p67
aVThat's an eyelash under a trillion dollars.
p68
aVThat's seven percent of revenues.
p69
aVDeception can cost billions.
p70
aVThink Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis.
p71
aVOr in the case of double agents and traitors,
p72
aVlike Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames,
p73
aVlies can betray our country,
p74
aVthey can compromise our security, they can undermine democracy,
p75
aVthey can cause the deaths of those that defend us.
p76
aa(lp77
VDeception is actually serious business.
p78
aVThis con man, Henry Oberlander, he was such an effective con man,
p79
aVBritish authorities say
p80
aVhe could have undermined the entire banking system of the Western world.
p81
aVAnd you can't find this guy on Google; you can't find him anywhere.
p82
aVHe was interviewed once, and he said the following.
p83
aVHe said, "Look, I've got one rule."
p84
aVAnd this was Henry's rule, he said,
p85
aV"Look, everyone is willing to give you something.
p86
aVThey're ready to give you something for whatever it is they're hungry for."
p87
aVAnd that's the crux of it.
p88
aVIf you don't want to be deceived, you have to know,
p89
aVwhat is it that you're hungry for?
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd we all kind of hate to admit it.
p92
aVWe wish we were better husbands, better wives,
p93
aVsmarter, more powerful, taller, richer \u2014
p94
aVthe list goes on.
p95
aVLying is an attempt to bridge that gap,
p96
aVto connect our wishes and our fantasies
p97
aVabout who we wish we were, how we wish we could be,
p98
aVwith what we're really like.
p99
aVAnd boy are we willing to fill in those gaps in our lives with lies.
p100
aa(lp101
VOn a given day, studies show that you may be lied to
p102
aVanywhere from 10 to 200 times.
p103
aVNow granted, many of those are white lies.
p104
aVBut in another study,
p105
aVit showed that strangers lied three times
p106
aVwithin the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
p107
aa(lp108
V(Laughter)
p109
aa(lp110
VNow when we first hear this data, we recoil.
p111
aVWe can't believe how prevalent lying is.
p112
aVWe're essentially against lying.
p113
aVBut if you look more closely, the plot actually thickens.
p114
aVWe lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers.
p115
aVExtroverts lie more than introverts.
p116
aVMen lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people.
p117
aVWomen lie more to protect other people.
p118
aVIf you're an average married couple,
p119
aVyou're going to lie to your spouse in one out of every 10 interactions.
p120
aVNow, you may think that's bad.
p121
aVIf you're unmarried, that number drops to three.
p122
aa(lp123
VLying's complex.
p124
aVIt's woven into the fabric of our daily and our business lives.
p125
aVWe're deeply ambivalent about the truth.
p126
aVWe parse it out on an as-needed basis,
p127
aVsometimes for very good reasons,
p128
aVother times just because we don't understand the gaps in our lives.
p129
aVThat's truth number two about lying.
p130
aVWe're against lying,
p131
aVbut we're covertly for it
p132
aVin ways that our society has sanctioned for centuries and centuries and centuries.
p133
aVIt's as old as breathing.
p134
aVIt's part of our culture, it's part of our history.
p135
aVThink Dante, Shakespeare, the Bible, News of the World.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Laughter)
p138
aa(lp139
VLying has evolutionary value to us as a species.
p140
aVResearchers have long known that the more intelligent the species,
p141
aVthe larger the neocortex,
p142
aVthe more likely it is to be deceptive.
p143
aVNow you might remember Koko.
p144
aVDoes anybody remember Koko the gorilla who was taught sign language?
p145
aVKoko was taught to communicate via sign language.
p146
aVHere's Koko with her kitten.
p147
aVIt's her cute little, fluffy pet kitten.
p148
aVKoko once blamed her pet kitten for ripping a sink out of the wall.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VWe're hardwired to become leaders of the pack.
p153
aVIt's starts really, really early.
p154
aVHow early?
p155
aVWell babies will fake a cry,
p156
aVpause, wait to see who's coming
p157
aVand then go right back to crying.
p158
aVOne-year-olds learn concealment.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VTwo-year-olds bluff.
p163
aVFive-year-olds lie outright.
p164
aVThey manipulate via flattery.
p165
aVNine-year-olds, masters of the cover-up.
p166
aVBy the time you enter college,
p167
aVyou're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions.
p168
aVBy the time we enter this work world and we're breadwinners,
p169
aVwe enter a world that is just cluttered with Spam, fake digital friends,
p170
aVpartisan media,
p171
aVingenious identity thieves,
p172
aVworld-class Ponzi schemers,
p173
aVa deception epidemic \u2014
p174
aVin short, what one author calls a post-truth society.
p175
aVIt's been very confusing for a long time now.
p176
aa(lp177
VWhat do you do?
p178
aVWell, there are steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass.
p179
aVTrained liespotters get to the truth 90 percent of the time.
p180
aVThe rest of us, we're only 54 percent accurate.
p181
aVWhy is it so easy to learn?
p182
aVThere are good liars and bad liars.
p183
aVThere are no real original liars.
p184
aVWe all make the same mistakes. We all use the same techniques.
p185
aVSo what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you two patterns of deception.
p186
aVAnd then we're going to look at the hot spots
p187
aVand see if we can find them ourselves.
p188
aVWe're going to start with speech.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Video) Bill Clinton: I want you to listen to me.
p191
aVI'm going to say this again.
p192
aVI did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.
p193
aVI never told anybody to lie, not a single time, never.
p194
aVAnd these allegations are false.
p195
aVAnd I need to go back to work for the American people.
p196
aVThank you.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Applause)
p199
aa(lp200
VPamela Meyer: Okay, what were the telltale signs?
p201
aVWell first we heard what's known as a non-contracted denial.
p202
aVStudies show that people who are overdetermined in their denial
p203
aVwill resort to formal rather than informal language.
p204
aVWe also heard distancing language: "that woman."
p205
aVWe know that liars will unconsciously distance themselves
p206
aVfrom their subject,
p207
aVusing language as their tool.
p208
aVNow if Bill Clinton had said, "Well, to tell you the truth ..."
p209
aVor Richard Nixon's favorite, "In all candor ..."
p210
aVhe would have been a dead giveaway
p211
aVfor any liespotter that knows
p212
aVthat qualifying language, as it's called, qualifying language like that,
p213
aVfurther discredits the subject.
p214
aVNow if he had repeated the question in its entirety,
p215
aVor if he had peppered his account with a little too much detail \u2014
p216
aVand we're all really glad he didn't do that \u2014
p217
aVhe would have further discredited himself.
p218
aa(lp219
VFreud had it right.
p220
aVFreud said, look, there's much more to it than speech:
p221
aV"No mortal can keep a secret.
p222
aVIf his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips."
p223
aVAnd we all do it no matter how powerful you are.
p224
aVWe all chatter with our fingertips.
p225
aVI'm going to show you Dominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama
p226
aVwho's chattering with his fingertips.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VNow this brings us to our next pattern, which is body language.
p231
aVWith body language, here's what you've got to do.
p232
aVYou've really got to just throw your assumptions out the door.
p233
aVLet the science temper your knowledge a little bit.
p234
aVBecause we think liars fidget all the time.
p235
aVWell guess what, they're known to freeze their upper bodies when they're lying.
p236
aVWe think liars won't look you in the eyes.
p237
aVWell guess what, they look you in the eyes a little too much
p238
aVjust to compensate for that myth.
p239
aVWe think warmth and smiles convey honesty, sincerity.
p240
aVBut a trained liespotter can spot a fake smile a mile away.
p241
aVCan you all spot the fake smile here?
p242
aVYou can consciously contract the muscles in your cheeks.
p243
aVBut the real smile's in the eyes, the crow's feet of the eyes.
p244
aVThey cannot be consciously contracted,
p245
aVespecially if you overdid the Botox.
p246
aVDon't overdo the Botox; nobody will think you're honest.
p247
aa(lp248
VNow we're going to look at the hot spots.
p249
aVCan you tell what's happening in a conversation?
p250
aVCan you start to find the hot spots
p251
aVto see the discrepancies
p252
aVbetween someone's words and someone's actions?
p253
aVNow, I know it seems really obvious,
p254
aVbut when you're having a conversation with someone you suspect of deception,
p255
aVattitude is by far the most overlooked but telling of indicators.
p256
aa(lp257
VAn honest person is going to be cooperative.
p258
aVThey're going to show they're on your side.
p259
aVThey're going to be enthusiastic.
p260
aVThey're going to be willing and helpful to getting you to the truth.
p261
aVThey're going to be willing to brainstorm, name suspects,
p262
aVprovide details.
p263
aVThey're going to say,
p264
aV"Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll that forged those checks."
p265
aVThey're going to be infuriated if they sense they're wrongly accused
p266
aVthroughout the entire course of the interview, not just in flashes;
p267
aVthey'll be infuriated throughout the entire course of the interview.
p268
aVAnd if you ask someone honest
p269
aVwhat should happen to whomever did forge those checks,
p270
aVan honest person is much more likely
p271
aVto recommend strict rather than lenient punishment.
p272
aa(lp273
VNow let's say you're having that exact same conversation
p274
aVwith someone deceptive.
p275
aVThat person may be withdrawn,
p276
aVlook down, lower their voice,
p277
aVpause, be kind of herky-jerky.
p278
aVAsk a deceptive person to tell their story,
p279
aVthey're going to pepper it with way too much detail
p280
aVin all kinds of irrelevant places.
p281
aVAnd then they're going to tell their story in strict chronological order.
p282
aVAnd what a trained interrogator does
p283
aVis they come in and in very subtle ways over the course of several hours,
p284
aVthey will ask that person to tell that story backwards,
p285
aVand then they'll watch them squirm,
p286
aVand track which questions produce the highest volume of deceptive tells.
p287
aa(lp288
VWhy do they do that? Well, we all do the same thing.
p289
aVWe rehearse our words,
p290
aVbut we rarely rehearse our gestures.
p291
aVWe say "yes," we shake our heads "no."
p292
aVWe tell very convincing stories, we slightly shrug our shoulders.
p293
aVWe commit terrible crimes,
p294
aVand we smile at the delight in getting away with it.
p295
aVNow, that smile is known in the trade as "duping delight."
p296
aa(lp297
VAnd we're going to see that in several videos moving forward,
p298
aVbut we're going to start \u2014 for those of you who don't know him,
p299
aVthis is presidential candidate John Edwards
p300
aVwho shocked America by fathering a child out of wedlock.
p301
aVWe're going to see him talk about getting a paternity test.
p302
aVSee now if you can spot him saying, "yes" while shaking his head "no,"
p303
aVslightly shrugging his shoulders.
p304
aa(lp305
V(Video) John Edwards: I'd be happy to participate in one.
p306
aVI know that it's not possible that this child could be mine,
p307
aVbecause of the timing of events.
p308
aVSo I know it's not possible.
p309
aVHappy to take a paternity test, and would love to see it happen.
p310
aa(lp311
VInterviewer: Are you going to do that soon? Is there somebody \u2014
p312
aa(lp313
VJE: Well, I'm only one side. I'm only one side of the test.
p314
aVBut I'm happy to participate in one.
p315
aa(lp316
VPM: Okay, those head shakes are much easier to spot
p317
aVonce you know to look for them.
p318
aVThere are going to be times when someone makes one expression
p319
aVwhile masking another that just kind of leaks through in a flash.
p320
aVMurderers are known to leak sadness.
p321
aVYour new joint venture partner might shake your hand,
p322
aVcelebrate, go out to dinner with you and then leak an expression of anger.
p323
aVAnd we're not all going to become facial expression experts overnight here,
p324
aVbut there's one I can teach you that's very dangerous
p325
aVand it's easy to learn,
p326
aVand that's the expression of contempt.
p327
aVNow with anger, you've got two people on an even playing field.
p328
aVIt's still somewhat of a healthy relationship.
p329
aVBut when anger turns to contempt, you've been dismissed.
p330
aVIt's associated with moral superiority.
p331
aVAnd for that reason, it's very, very hard to recover from.
p332
aVHere's what it looks like.
p333
aVIt's marked by one lip corner pulled up and in.
p334
aVIt's the only asymmetrical expression.
p335
aVAnd in the presence of contempt, whether or not deception follows \u2014
p336
aVand it doesn't always follow \u2014
p337
aVlook the other way, go the other direction,
p338
aVreconsider the deal,
p339
aVsay, "No thank you. I'm not coming up for just one more nightcap. Thank you."
p340
aa(lp341
VScience has surfaced many, many more indicators.
p342
aVWe know, for example,
p343
aVwe know liars will shift their blink rate,
p344
aVpoint their feet towards an exit.
p345
aVThey will take barrier objects
p346
aVand put them between themselves and the person that is interviewing them.
p347
aVThey'll alter their vocal tone,
p348
aVoften making their vocal tone much lower.
p349
aa(lp350
VNow here's the deal.
p351
aVThese behaviors are just behaviors.
p352
aVThey're not proof of deception.
p353
aVThey're red flags.
p354
aVWe're human beings.
p355
aVWe make deceptive flailing gestures all over the place all day long.
p356
aVThey don't mean anything in and of themselves.
p357
aVBut when you see clusters of them, that's your signal.
p358
aVLook, listen, probe, ask some hard questions,
p359
aVget out of that very comfortable mode of knowing,
p360
aVwalk into curiosity mode, ask more questions,
p361
aVhave a little dignity, treat the person you're talking to with rapport.
p362
aVDon't try to be like those folks on "Law & Order" and those other TV shows
p363
aVthat pummel their subjects into submission.
p364
aVDon't be too aggressive, it doesn't work.
p365
aa(lp366
VNow, we've talked a little bit about how to talk to someone who's lying
p367
aVand how to spot a lie.
p368
aVAnd as I promised, we're now going to look at what the truth looks like.
p369
aVBut I'm going to show you two videos,
p370
aVtwo mothers \u2014 one is lying, one is telling the truth.
p371
aVAnd these were surfaced by researcher David Matsumoto in California.
p372
aVAnd I think they're an excellent example of what the truth looks like.
p373
aa(lp374
VThis mother, Diane Downs,
p375
aVshot her kids at close range,
p376
aVdrove them to the hospital while they bled all over the car,
p377
aVclaimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it.
p378
aVAnd you'll see when you see the video,
p379
aVshe can't even pretend to be an agonizing mother.
p380
aVWhat you want to look for here is an incredible discrepancy
p381
aVbetween horrific events that she describes and her very, very cool demeanor.
p382
aVAnd if you look closely, you'll see duping delight throughout this video.
p383
aa(lp384
V(Video) Diane Downs: At night when I close my eyes,
p385
aVI can see Christie reaching her hand out to me while I'm driving,
p386
aVand the blood just kept coming out of her mouth.
p387
aVAnd that \u2014 maybe it'll fade too with time \u2014
p388
aVbut I don't think so.
p389
aVThat bothers me the most.
p390
aa(lp391
VPM: Now I'm going to show you a video
p392
aa(lp393
Vof an actual grieving mother, Erin Runnion,
p394
aVconfronting her daughter's murderer and torturer in court.
p395
aVHere you're going to see no false emotion,
p396
aVjust the authentic expression of a mother's agony.
p397
aa(lp398
V(Video) Erin Runnion: I wrote this statement
p399
aVon the third anniversary of the night you took my baby,
p400
aVand you hurt her,
p401
aVand you crushed her,
p402
aVyou terrified her until her heart stopped.
p403
aVAnd she fought, and I know she fought you.
p404
aVBut I know she looked at you with those amazing brown eyes,
p405
aVand you still wanted to kill her.
p406
aVAnd I don't understand it,
p407
aVand I never will.
p408
aa(lp409
VPM: Okay, there's no doubting the veracity of those emotions.
p410
aa(lp411
VNow the technology around what the truth looks like
p412
aVis progressing on, the science of it.
p413
aVWe know, for example,
p414
aVthat we now have specialized eye trackers and infrared brain scans,
p415
aVMRI's that can decode the signals that our bodies send out
p416
aVwhen we're trying to be deceptive.
p417
aVAnd these technologies are going to be marketed to all of us
p418
aVas panaceas for deceit,
p419
aVand they will prove incredibly useful some day.
p420
aVBut you've got to ask yourself in the meantime:
p421
aVWho do you want on your side of the meeting,
p422
aVsomeone who's trained in getting to the truth
p423
aVor some guy who's going to drag a 400-pound electroencephalogram
p424
aVthrough the door?
p425
aa(lp426
VLiespotters rely on human tools.
p427
aVThey know, as someone once said,
p428
aV"Character's who you are in the dark."
p429
aVAnd what's kind of interesting is that today, we have so little darkness.
p430
aVOur world is lit up 24 hours a day.
p431
aVIt's transparent with blogs and social networks
p432
aVbroadcasting the buzz of a whole new generation of people
p433
aVthat have made a choice to live their lives in public.
p434
aVIt's a much more noisy world.
p435
aVSo one challenge we have is to remember,
p436
aVoversharing, that's not honesty.
p437
aVOur manic tweeting and texting can blind us
p438
aVto the fact that the subtleties of human decency \u2014 character integrity \u2014
p439
aVthat's still what matters, that's always what's going to matter.
p440
aVSo in this much noisier world,
p441

p442
aVto be just a little bit more explicit about our moral code.
p443
aa(lp444
VWhen you combine the science of recognizing deception
p445
aVwith the art of looking, listening,
p446
aVyou exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie.
p447
aVYou start up that path of being just a little bit more explicit,
p448
aVbecause you signal to everyone around you,
p449
aVyou say, "Hey, my world, our world, it's going to be an honest one.
p450
aVMy world is going to be one where truth is strengthened
p451
aVand falsehood is recognized and marginalized."
p452
aVAnd when you do that,
p453
aVthe ground around you starts to shift just a little bit.
p454
aa(lp455
VAnd that's the truth. Thank you.
