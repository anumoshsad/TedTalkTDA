VMy travels to Afghanistan
p4
aVbegan many, many years ago
p5
aVon the eastern border of my country,
p6
aVmy homeland, Poland.

aVI was walking through the forests
p8
aVof my grandmother's tales.
p9
aVA land where every field hides a grave,
p10
aVwhere millions of people
p11
aVhave been deported or killed
p12
aVin the 20th century.
p13
aa(lp14
VBehind the destruction,
p15
aVI found a soul of places.
p16
aVI met humble people.
p17
aVI heard their prayer
p18
aVand ate their bread.

p21
aVthrough the Caucasus Mountains,
p22
aVMiddle East,
p23
aVNorth Africa,
p24
aVRussia.
p25
aVAnd I ever met more humble people.
p26
aVAnd I shared their bread and their prayer.
p27
aVThis is why I went to Afghanistan.
p28
aa(lp29
VOne day, I crossed the bridge
p30
aVover the Oxus River.
p31
aVI was alone on foot.
p32
aVAnd the Afghan soldier was so surprised to see me
p33
aVthat he forgot to stamp my passport.
p34
aVBut he gave me a cup of tea.
p35
aVAnd I understood
p36
aVthat his surprise was my protection.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo I have been walking and traveling,
p39
aVby horses, by yak, by truck, by hitchhiking,
p40
aVfrom Iran's border
p41
aVto the bottom, to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor.
p42
aVAnd in this way
p43
aVI could find noor, the hidden light of Afghanistan.
p44
aVMy only weapon
p45
aVwas my notebook and my Leica.
p46
aVI heard prayers of the Sufi \u2014

aVhated by the Taliban.
p49
aVHidden river,
p50
aVinterconnected with the mysticism
p51
aVfrom Gibraltar to India.
p52
aVThe mosque where the respectful foreigner
p53
aVis showered with blessings
p54
aVand with tears,
p55
aVand welcomed as a gift.

aa(lp57
VWhat do we know
p58
aVabout the country and the people
p59
aVthat we pretend to protect,
p60
aVabout the villages
p61
aVwhere the only one medicine
p62
aVto kill the pain and to stop the hunger
p63
aVis opium?
p64
aVThese are opium-addicted people
p65
aVon the roofs of Kabul

aVwho became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen.

aVwith the name of burqa.
p75
aVI saw one day,

aVa girls' school.
p78
aV13,000 girls
p79
aVstudying here
p80
aVin the rooms underground,
p81
aVfull of scorpions.

VWhat do we know

aa(lp92
VMy aim is to give a voice
p93
