VI have all my life wondered what "mind-boggling" meant.
p4
aVAfter two days here, I declare myself boggled, and enormously impressed,
p5
aVand feel that you are one of the great hopes \u2014
p6
aVnot just for American achievement in science and technology,
p7
aVbut for the whole world.
p8
aVI've come, however, on a special mission on behalf of my constituency,
p9
aVwhich are the 10-to-the-18th-power \u2014 that's a million trillion \u2014
p10
aVinsects and other small creatures, and to make a plea for them.
p11
aVIf we were to wipe out insects alone, just that group alone, on this planet \u2014
p12
aVwhich we are trying hard to do \u2014
p13
aVthe rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land.
p14
aVAnd within a few months.
p15
aVNow, how did I come to this particular position of advocacy?
p16
aa(lp17
VAs a little boy, and through my teenage years,
p18
aVI became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life.
p19
aVI had a butterfly period, a snake period, a bird period, a fish period, a cave period
p20
aVand finally and definitively, an ant period.
p21
aVBy my college years, I was a devoted myrmecologist,
p22
aVa specialist on the biology of ants,
p23
aVbut my attention and research continued to make journeys
p24
aVacross the great variety of life on Earth in general \u2014
p25
aVincluding all that it means to us as a species, how little we understand it
p26
aVand how pressing a danger that our activities have created for it.
p27
aa(lp28
VOut of that broader study has emerged a concern and an ambition,
p29
aVcrystallized in the wish that I'm about to make to you.
p30
aVMy choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment
p31
aVthat began with growing up on the Gulf Coast of Alabama, on the Florida peninsula.
p32
aVAs far back as I can remember, I was enchanted by the natural beauty of that region
p33
aVand the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there.
p34
aVOne day when I was only seven years old and fishing,
p35
aVI pulled a "pinfish," they're called, with sharp dorsal spines, up too hard and fast,
p36
aVand I blinded myself in one eye.
p37
aVI later discovered I was also hard of hearing,
p38
aVpossibly congenitally, in the upper registers.
p39
aVSo in planning to be a professional naturalist \u2014
p40
aVI never considered anything else in my entire life \u2014
p41
aVI found that I was lousy at bird watching and couldn't track frog calls either.
p42
aVSo I turned to the teeming small creatures
p43
aVthat can be held between the thumb and forefinger:
p44
aVthe little things that compose the foundation of our ecosystems,
p45
aVthe little things, as I like to say, who run the world.
p46
aVIn so doing, I reached a frontier of biology so strange, so rich,
p47
aVthat it seemed as though it exists on another planet.
p48
aVIn fact, we live on a mostly unexplored planet.
p49
aVThe great majority of organisms on Earth remain unknown to science.
p50
aa(lp51
VIn the last 30 years, thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world
p52
aVand advances in technology,
p53
aVbiologists have, for example, added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species,
p54
aVto bring the current total to 5,400,
p55
aVand more continue to pour in.
p56
aVTwo new kinds of whales have been discovered, along with two new antelopes,
p57
aVdozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant \u2014
p58
aVand even a distinct kind of gorilla.
p59
aVAt the extreme opposite end of the size scale, the class of marine bacteria,
p60
aVthe Prochlorococci \u2014 that will be on the final exam \u2014
p61
aValthough discovered only in 1988, are now recognized as likely the most abundant organisms on Earth,
p62
aVand moreover, responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean.
p63
aVThese bacteria were not uncovered sooner
p64
aVbecause they are also among the smallest of all Earth's organisms \u2014
p65
aVso minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy.
p66
aVYet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures.
p67
aa(lp68
VThese examples are just the first glimpse of our ignorance of life on this planet.
p69
aVConsider the fungi \u2014 including mushrooms, rusts, molds and many disease-causing organisms.
p70
aV60,000 species are known to science,
p71
aVbut more than 1.5 million have been estimated to exist.
p72
aVConsider the nematode roundworm, the most abundant of all animals.
p73
aVFour out of five animals on Earth are nematode worms \u2014
p74
aVif all solid materials except nematode worms were to be eliminated,
p75
aVyou could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms.
p76
aVAbout 16,000 species of nematode worms
p77
aVhave been discovered and diagnosed by scientists;
p78
aVthere could be hundreds of thousands of them, even millions, still unknown.
p79
aVThis vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further
p80
aVby the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria,
p81
aVwhich within just the last several years
p82
aVstill were known from only about 6,000 species of bacteria worldwide.
p83
aVBut that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil,
p84
aVjust a little handful of soil, in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there.
p85
aVIt's been estimated that a single ton of soil \u2014 fertile soil \u2014
p86
aVcontains approximately four million species of bacteria, all unknown.
p87
aa(lp88
VSo the question is: what are they all doing?
p89
aVThe fact is, we don't know.
p90
aVWe are living on a planet with a lot of activities, with reference to our living environment,
p91
aVdone by faith and guess alone.
p92
aVOur lives depend upon these creatures.
p93
aVTo take an example close to home: there are over 500 species of bacteria now known \u2014
p94
aVfriendly bacteria \u2014 living symbiotically in your mouth and throat
p95
aVprobably necessary to your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria.
p96
aa(lp97
VAt this point I think we have a little impressionistic film
p98
aVthat was made especially for this occasion.
p99
aVAnd I'd like to show it.
p100
aVAssisted in this by Billie Holiday.
p101
aV(Video)
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd that may be just the beginning!
p104
aVThe viruses, those quasi-organisms among which are the prophages,
p105
aVthe gene weavers that promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria,
p106
aVare a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology, a world unto themselves.
p107
aVWhat constitutes a viral species is still unresolved,
p108
aValthough they're obviously of enormous importance to us.
p109
aVBut this much we can say: the variety of genes on the planet in viruses
p110
aVexceeds, or is likely to exceed, that in all of the rest of life combined.
p111
aVNowadays, in addressing microbial biodiversity,
p112
aVscientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the Pacific Ocean.
p113
aa(lp114
VBut that is changing rapidly with the aid of new genomic technology.
p115
aVAlready it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hours.
p116
aVSoon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs \u2014
p117
aVto hunt bacteria in tiny crevices of the habitat's surface
p118
aVin the way you go watching for birds with binoculars.
p119
aVWhat will we find as we map the living world, as, finally, we get this underway seriously?
p120
aVAs we move past the relatively gigantic mammals, birds, frogs and plants
p121
aVto the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond
p122
aVto the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world
p123
aVenveloped and living within humanity?
p124
aVAlready what were thought to be bacteria for generations
p125
aVhave been found to compose, instead, two great domains of microorganisms:
p126
aVtrue bacteria and one-celled organisms the archaea,
p127
aVwhich are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota, the group that we belong to.
p128
aa(lp129
VSome serious biologists, and I count myself among them,
p130
aVhave begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms,
p131
aVone might \u2014 just might \u2014 find aliens among them.
p132
aVTrue aliens, stocks that arrived from outer space.
p133
aVThey've had billions of years to do it,
p134
aVbut especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet.
p135
aVWe do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin
p136
aVare capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature
p137
aVand other harsh changes in environment,
p138
aVincluding hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the Pyrex vessels
p139
aVaround the growing population of bacteria.
p140
aVThere may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically
p141
aVand the species that compose it as a great flux of entities
p142
aVhardly worth distinguishing one from the other.
p143
aVBut each of these species, even the tiniest Prochlorococci,
p144
aVare masterpieces of evolution.
p145
aVEach has persisted for thousands to millions of years.
p146
aVEach is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives,
p147
aVinterlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend
p148
aVin ways we have not begun even to imagine.
p149
aVWe will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them
p150
aVat the peril of our own existence \u2014
p151
aVand unfortunately we are destroying them with ingenuity and ceaseless energy.
p152
aa(lp153
VMy own epiphany as a conservationist came in 1953, while a Harvard graduate student,
p154
aVsearching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of Cuba,
p155
aVants that shine in the sunlight \u2014
p156
aVmetallic green or metallic blue, according to species, and one species, I discovered, metallic gold.
p157
aVI found my magical ants, but only after a tough climb into the mountains
p158
aVwhere the last of the native Cuban forests hung on,
p159
aVand were then \u2014 and still are \u2014 being cut back.
p160
aVI realized then that these species
p161
aVand a large part of the other unique, marvelous animals and plants on that island \u2014
p162
aVand this is true of practically every part of the world \u2014
p163
aVwhich took millions of years to evolve, are in the process of disappearing forever.
p164
aVAnd so it is everywhere one looks.
p165
aa(lp166
VThe human juggernaut is permanently eroding Earth's ancient biosphere by a combination of forces
p167
aVthat can be summarized by the acronym "HIPPO," the animal hippo.
p168
aVH is for habitat destruction, including climate change forced by greenhouse gases.
p169
aVI is for the invasive species like the fire ants, the zebra mussels, broom grasses
p170
aVand pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country, and at an exponential rate \u2014 that's the I.
p171
aVThe P, the first one in "HIPPO," is for pollution.
p172
aVThe second is for continued population, human population expansion.
p173
aVAnd the final letter is O, for over-harvesting \u2014
p174
aVdriving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing.
p175
aVThe HIPPO juggernaut we have created, if unabated, is destined \u2014
p176
aVaccording to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research \u2014
p177
aVto reduce half of Earth's still surviving animal and plant species
p178
aVto extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century.
p179
aVHuman-forced climate change alone \u2014 again, if unabated \u2014
p180
aVcould eliminate a quarter of surviving species during the next five decades.
p181
aVWhat will we and all future generations lose
p182
aVif much of the living environment is thus degraded?
p183
aVHuge potential sources of scientific information yet to be gathered,
p184
aVmuch of our environmental stability
p185
aVand new kinds of pharmaceuticals and new products of unimaginable strength and value \u2014
p186
aVall thrown away.
p187
aa(lp188
VThe loss will inflict a heavy price
p189
aVin wealth, security and yes, spirituality for all time to come,
p190
aVbecause previous cataclysms of this kind \u2014
p191
aVthe last one, that ended the age of dinosaurs \u2014
p192
aVtook, normally, five to 10 million years to repair.
p193
aVSadly, our knowledge of biodiversity is so incomplete
p194
aVthat we are at risk of losing a great deal of it before it is even discovered.
p195
aVFor example, even in the United States, the 200,000 species known currently
p196
aVactually has been found to be only partial in coverage;
p197
aVit is mostly unknown to us in basic biology.
p198
aVOnly about 15 percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status.
p199
aVOf the 15 percent evaluated, 20 percent are classified as "in peril,"
p200
aVthat is, in danger of extinction.
p201
aVThat's in the United States.
p202
aVWe are, in short, flying blind into our environmental future.
p203
aVWe urgently need to change this.
p204
aVWe need to have the biosphere properly explored
p205
aVso that we can understand and competently manage it.
p206
aVWe need to settle down before we wreck the planet.
p207
aVAnd we need that knowledge.
p208
aa(lp209
VThis should be a big science project equivalent to the Human Genome Project.
p210
aVIt should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable.
p211
aVSo this brings me to my wish for TEDsters,
p212
aVand to anyone else around the world who hears this talk.
p213
aVI wish we will work together to help create the key tools
p214
aVthat we need to inspire preservation of Earth's biodiversity.
p215
aVAnd let us call it the "Encyclopedia of Life."
p216
aVWhat is the "Encyclopedia of Life?" A concept that has already taken hold
p217
aVand is beginning to spread and be looked at seriously?
p218
aVIt is an encyclopedia that lives on the Internet
p219
aVand is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world.
p220
aVAmateurs can do it also.
p221
aVIt has an indefinitely expandable page for each species.
p222
aa(lp223
VIt makes all key information about life on Earth accessible to anyone,
p224
aVon demand, anywhere in the world.
p225
aVI've written about this idea before,
p226
aVand I know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it in the past.
p227
aVBut what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form,
p228
aVscience has advanced.
p229
aVTechnology has moved forward.
p230
aVToday, the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia,
p231
aVregardless of the magnitude of the information put into it, are within reach.
p232
aVIndeed, in the past year, a group of influential scientific institutions
p233
aVhave begun mobilizing to realize this dream.
p234
aVI wish you would help them.
p235
aVWorking together, we can make this real.
p236
aa(lp237
VThe encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications.
p238
aVIt will address transcendent qualities in the human consciousness, and sense of human need.
p239
aVIt will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity.
p240
aVAnd most of all, it can inspire a new generation of biologists
p241
aVto continue the quest that started, for me personally, 60 years ago:
p242
aVto search for life, to understand it and finally, above all, to preserve it.
p243
aVThat is my wish. Thank you.
