VI study the future
p4
aVof crime and terrorism,
p5
aVand frankly, I'm afraid.
p6
aVI'm afraid by what I see.
p7
aVI sincerely want to believe
p8
aVthat technology can bring us
p9
aVthe techno-utopia that we've been promised,
p10
aVbut, you see,
p11
aVI've spent a career in law enforcement,
p12
aVand that's informed my perspective on things.
p13
aVI've been a street police officer,
p14
aVan undercover investigator,
p15
aVa counter-terrorism strategist,
p16
aVand I've worked in more than 70 countries
p17
aVaround the world.
p18
aVI've had to see more than my fair share
p19
aVof violence and the darker underbelly of society,
p20
aVand that's informed my opinions.
p21
aVMy work with criminals and terrorists
p22
aVhas actually been highly educational.
p23
aVThey have taught me a lot, and I'd like to be able
p24
aVto share some of these observations with you.
p25
aa(lp26
VToday I'm going to show you the flip side
p27
aVof all those technologies that we marvel at,
p28
aVthe ones that we love.
p29
aVIn the hands of the TED community,
p30
aVthese are awesome tools which will bring about
p31
aVgreat change for our world,
p32
aVbut in the hands of suicide bombers,
p33
aVthe future can look quite different.
p34
aa(lp35
VI started observing
p36
aVtechnology and how criminals were using it
p37
aVas a young patrol officer.
p38
aVIn those days, this was the height of technology.
p39
aVLaugh though you will,
p40
aVall the drug dealers and gang members
p41
aVwith whom I dealt had one of these
p42
aVlong before any police officer I knew did.
p43
aa(lp44
VTwenty years later, criminals are still using
p45
aVmobile phones, but they're also building
p46
aVtheir own mobile phone networks,
p47
aVlike this one, which has been deployed
p48
aVin all 31 states of Mexico by the narcos.
p49
aVThey have a national encrypted
p50
aVradio communications system.
p51
aVThink about that.
p52
aVThink about the innovation that went into that.
p53
aVThink about the infrastructure to build it.
p54
aVAnd then think about this:
p55
aVWhy can't I get a cell phone signal in San Francisco? (Laughter)
p56
aVHow is this possible? (Laughter) It makes no sense. (Applause)
p57
aa(lp58
VWe consistently underestimate
p59
aVwhat criminals and terrorists can do.
p60
aVTechnology has made our world
p61
aVincreasingly open, and for the most part,
p62
aVthat's great, but all of this openness
p63
aVmay have unintended consequences.
p64
aa(lp65
VConsider the 2008 terrorist attack on Mumbai.
p66
aVThe men that carried that attack out were armed
p67
aVwith AK-47s, explosives and hand grenades.
p68
aVThey threw these hand grenades
p69
aVat innocent people as they sat eating in cafes
p70
aVand waited to catch trains on their way home from work.
p71
aVBut heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations.
p72
aVGuns and bombs are nothing new.
p73
aVWhat was different this time
p74
aVis the way that the terrorists used
p75
aVmodern information communications technologies
p76
aVto locate additional victims and slaughter them.
p77
aVThey were armed with mobile phones.
p78
aVThey had BlackBerries.
p79
aVThey had access to satellite imagery.
p80
aVThey had satellite phones, and they even had night vision goggles.
p81
aVBut perhaps their greatest innovation was this.
p82
aVWe've all seen pictures like this
p83
aVon television and in the news. This is an operations center.
p84
aVAnd the terrorists built their very own op center
p85
aVacross the border in Pakistan,
p86
aVwhere they monitored the BBC,
p87
aVal Jazeera, CNN and Indian local stations.
p88
aVThey also monitored the Internet and social media
p89
aVto monitor the progress of their attacks
p90
aVand how many people they had killed.
p91
aVThey did all of this in real time.
p92
aa(lp93
VThe innovation of the terrorist operations center
p94
aVgave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness
p95
aVand tactical advantage over the police
p96
aVand over the government.
p97
aVWhat did they do with this?
p98
aVThey used it to great effect.
p99
aa(lp100
VAt one point during the 60-hour siege,
p101
aVthe terrorists were going room to room
p102
aVtrying to find additional victims.
p103
aVThey came upon a suite on the top floor
p104
aVof the hotel, and they kicked down the door
p105
aVand they found a man hiding by his bed.
p106
aVAnd they said to him, "Who are you,
p107
aVand what are you doing here?"
p108
aVAnd the man replied,
p109
aV"I'm just an innocent schoolteacher."
p110
aVOf course, the terrorists knew
p111
aVthat no Indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the Taj.
p112
aVThey picked up his identification,
p113
aVand they phoned his name in to the terrorist war room,
p114
aVwhere the terrorist war room Googled him,
p115
aVand found a picture and called their operatives
p116
aVon the ground and said,
p117
aV"Your hostage, is he heavyset?
p118
aVIs he bald in front? Does he wear glasses?"
p119
aV"Yes, yes, yes," came the answers.
p120
aVThe op center had found him and they had a match.
p121
aVHe was not a schoolteacher.
p122
aVHe was the second-wealthiest businessman in India,
p123
aVand after discovering this information,
p124
aVthe terrorist war room gave the order
p125
aVto the terrorists on the ground in Mumbai.
p126
aV("Kill him.")
p127
aa(lp128
VWe all worry about our privacy settings
p129
aVon Facebook,
p130
aVbut the fact of the matter is,
p131
aVour openness can be used against us.
p132
aVTerrorists are doing this.
p133
aVA search engine can determine
p134
aVwho shall live and who shall die.
p135
aVThis is the world that we live in.
p136
aa(lp137
VDuring the Mumbai siege,
p138
aVterrorists were so dependent on technology
p139
aVthat several witnesses reported that
p140
aVas the terrorists were shooting hostages with one hand,
p141
aVthey were checking their mobile phone messages
p142
aVin the very other hand.
p143
aVIn the end, 300 people were gravely wounded
p144
aVand over 172 men, women and children
p145
aVlost their lives that day.
p146
aa(lp147
VThink about what happened.
p148
aVDuring this 60-hour siege on Mumbai,
p149
aV10 men armed not just with weapons,
p150
aVbut with technology,
p151
aVwere able to bring a city of 20 million people
p152
aVto a standstill.
p153
aVTen people brought 20 million people
p154
aVto a standstill, and this traveled around the world.
p155
aVThis is what radicals can do with openness.
p156
aa(lp157
VThis was done nearly four years ago.
p158
aVWhat could terrorists do today
p159
aVwith the technologies available that we have?
p160
aVWhat will they do tomorrow?
p161
aVThe ability of one to affect many
p162
aVis scaling exponentially,
p163
aVand it's scaling for good and it's scaling for evil.
p164
aa(lp165
VIt's not just about terrorism, though.
p166
aVThere's also been a big paradigm shift in crime.
p167
aVYou see, you can now commit more crime as well.
p168
aVIn the old days, it was a knife and a gun.
p169
aVThen criminals moved to robbing trains.
p170
aVYou could rob 200 people on a train, a great innovation.
p171
aVMoving forward, the Internet
p172
aVallowed things to scale even more.
p173
aVIn fact, many of you will remember
p174
aVthe recent Sony PlayStation hack.
p175
aVIn that incident, over 100 million people were robbed.
p176
aVThink about that.
p177
aVWhen in the history of humanity
p178
aVhas it ever been possible for one person
p179
aVto rob 100 million?
p180
aa(lp181
VOf course, it's not just about stealing things.
p182
aVThere are other avenues of technology
p183
aVthat criminals can exploit.
p184
aVMany of you will remember this super cute video
p185
aVfrom the last TED,
p186
aVbut not all quadcopter swarms are so nice and cute.
p187
aVThey don't all have drumsticks.
p188
aVSome can be armed with HD cameras
p189
aVand do countersurveillance on protesters,
p190
aVor, as in this little bit of movie magic,
p191
aVquadcopters can be loaded with firearms
p192
aVand automatic weapons.
p193
aVLittle robots are cute when they play music to you.
p194
aVWhen they swarm and chase you down the block
p195
aVto shoot you, a little bit less so.
p196
aa(lp197
VOf course, criminals and terrorists weren't the first
p198
aVto give guns to robots. We know where that started.
p199
aVBut they're adapting quickly.
p200
aVRecently, the FBI arrested
p201
aVan al Qaeda affiliate in the United States,
p202
aVwho was planning on using these remote-controlled
p203
aVdrone aircraft to fly C4 explosives
p204
aVinto government buildings in the United States.
p205
aVBy the way, these travel at over 600 miles an hour.
p206
aa(lp207
VEvery time a new technology is being introduced,
p208
aVcriminals are there to exploit it.
p209
aVWe've all seen 3D printers.
p210
aVWe know with them that you can print
p211
aVin many materials ranging from plastic
p212
aVto chocolate to metal and even concrete.
p213
aVWith great precision
p214
aVI actually was able to make this
p215
aVjust the other day, a very cute little ducky.
p216
aVBut I wonder to myself,
p217
aVfor those people that strap bombs to their chests
p218
aVand blow themselves up,
p219
aVhow might they use 3D printers?
p220
aa(lp221
VPerhaps like this.
p222
aVYou see, if you can print in metal,
p223
aVyou can print one of these,
p224
aVand in fact
p225
aVyou can also print one of these too.
p226
aVThe UK I know has some very strict firearms laws.
p227
aVYou needn't bring the gun into the UK anymore.
p228
aVYou just bring the 3D printer
p229
aVand print the gun while you're here,
p230
aVand, of course, the magazines for your bullets.
p231
aa(lp232
VBut as these get bigger in the future,
p233
aVwhat other items will you be able to print?
p234
aVThe technologies are allowing bigger printers.
p235
aa(lp236
VAs we move forward,
p237
aVwe'll see new technologies also, like the Internet of Things.
p238
aVEvery day we're connecting more and more of our lives
p239
aVto the Internet, which means
p240
aVthat the Internet of Things will soon be
p241
aVthe Internet of Things To Be Hacked.
p242
aVAll of the physical objects in our space
p243
aVare being transformed into information technologies,
p244
aVand that has a radical implication for our security,
p245
aVbecause more connections to more devices
p246
aVmeans more vulnerabilities.
p247
aVCriminals understand this.
p248
aVTerrorists understand this. Hackers understand this.
p249
aVIf you control the code, you control the world.
p250
aVThis is the future that awaits us.
p251
aa(lp252
VThere has not yet been an operating system
p253
aVor a technology that hasn't been hacked.
p254
aVThat's troubling, since the human body itself
p255
aVis now becoming an information technology.
p256
aVAs we've seen here, we're transforming ourselves into cyborgs.
p257
aVEvery year, thousands of cochlear implants,
p258
aVdiabetic pumps, pacemakers
p259
aVand defibrillators are being implanted in people.
p260
aVIn the United States, there are 60,000 people
p261
aVwho have a pacemaker that connects to the Internet.
p262
aVThe defibrillators allow a physician at a distance
p263
aVto give a shock to a heart
p264
aVin case a patient needs it.
p265
aVBut if you don't need it,
p266
aVand somebody else gives you the shock,
p267
aVit's not a good thing.
p268
aa(lp269
VOf course, we're going to go even deeper than the human body.
p270
aVWe're going down to the cellular level these days.
p271
aVUp until this point, all the technologies
p272
aVI've been talking about have been silicon-based, ones and zeroes,
p273
aVbut there's another operating system out there:
p274
aVthe original operating system, DNA.
p275
aVAnd to hackers, DNA is just another operating system
p276
aVwaiting to be hacked.
p277
aVIt's a great challenge for them.
p278
aVThere are people already working on hacking the software of life,
p279
aVand while most of them are doing this to great good
p280
aVand to help us all,
p281
aVsome won't be.
p282
aa(lp283
VSo how will criminals abuse this?
p284
aVWell, with synthetic biology you can do some pretty neat things.
p285
aVFor example, I predict that we will move away
p286
aVfrom a plant-based narcotics world
p287
aVto a synthetic one. Why do you need the plants anymore?
p288
aVYou can just take the DNA code from marijuana
p289
aVor poppies or coca leaves
p290
aVand cut and past that gene
p291
aVand put it into yeast,
p292
aVand you can take those yeast
p293
aVand make them make the cocaine for you,
p294
aVor the marijuana, or any other drug.
p295
aVSo how we use yeast in the future
p296
aVis going to be really interesting.
p297
aVIn fact, we may have some really interesting bread and beer
p298
aVas we go into this next century.
p299
aa(lp300
VThe cost of sequencing the human genome is dropping precipitously.
p301
aVIt was proceeding at Moore's Law pace,
p302
aVbut then in 2008, something changed.
p303
aVThe technologies got better,
p304
aVand now DNA sequencing is proceeding at a pace
p305
aVfive times that of Moore's Law.
p306
aVThat has significant implications for us.
p307
aa(lp308
VIt took us 30 years to get from
p309
aVthe introduction of the personal computer
p310
aVto the level of cybercrime we have today,
p311
aVbut looking at how biology is proceeding so rapidly,
p312
aVand knowing criminals and terrorists as I do,
p313
aVwe may get there a lot faster
p314
aVwith biocrime in the future.
p315
aVIt will be easy for anybody to go ahead
p316
aVand print their own bio-virus,
p317
aVenhanced versions of ebola or anthrax,
p318
aVweaponized flu.
p319
aa(lp320
VWe recently saw a case where some researchers
p321
aVmade the H5N1 avian influenza virus more potent.
p322
aVIt already has a 70 percent mortality rate
p323
aVif you get it, but it's hard to get.
p324
aVEngineers, by moving around a small number
p325
aVof genetic changes,
p326
aVwere able to weaponize it
p327
aVand make it much more easy for human beings to catch,
p328
aVso that not thousands of people would die,
p329
aVbut tens of millions.
p330
aVYou see, you can go ahead and create
p331
aVnew pandemics, and the researchers who did this
p332
aVwere so proud of their accomplishments,
p333
aVthey wanted to publish it openly
p334
aVso that everybody could see this
p335
aVand get access to this information.
p336
aa(lp337
VBut it goes deeper than that.
p338
aVDNA researcher Andrew Hessel
p339
aVhas pointed out quite rightly
p340
aVthat if you can use cancer treatments,
p341
aVmodern cancer treatments,
p342
aVto go after one cell while leaving all the other cells
p343
aVaround it intact,
p344
aVthen you can also go after any one person's cell.
p345
aVPersonalized cancer treatments
p346
aVare the flip side of personalized bioweapons,
p347
aVwhich means you can attack any one individual,
p348
aVincluding all the people in this picture.
p349
aVHow will we protect them in the future?
p350
aa(lp351
VWhat to do? What to do about all this?
p352
aVThat's what I get asked all the time.
p353
aVFor those of you who follow me on Twitter,
p354
aVI will be tweeting out the answer later on today. (Laughter)
p355
aa(lp356
VActually, it's a bit more complex than that,
p357
aVand there are no magic bullets.
p358
aVI don't have all the answers,
p359
aVbut I know a few things.
p360
aVIn the wake of 9/11,
p361
aVthe best security minds
p362
aVput together all their innovation
p363
aVand this is what they created for security.
p364
aVIf you're expecting the people who built this to protect you
p365
aVfrom the coming robopocalypse \u2014 (Laughter)
p366
aV\u2014 uh, you may want to have a backup plan. (Laughter)
p367
aVJust saying. Just think about that. (Applause)
p368
aa(lp369
VLaw enforcement is currently a closed system.
p370
aVIt's nation-based, while the threat is international.
p371
aVPolicing doesn't scale globally. At least, it hasn't,
p372
aVand our current system of guns, border guards, big gates and fences
p373
aVare outdated in the new world into which we're moving.
p374
aVSo how might we prepare for some of these specific threats,
p375
aVlike attacking a president or a prime minister?
p376
aVThis would be the natural government response,
p377
aVto hide away all our government leaders
p378
aVin hermetically sealed bubbles.
p379
aVBut this is not going to work.
p380
aVThe cost of doing a DNA sequence is going to be trivial.
p381
aVAnybody will have it and we will all have them in the future.
p382
aa(lp383
VSo maybe there's a more radical way that we can look at this.
p384
aVWhat happens if we were to take
p385
aVthe President's DNA, or a king or queen's,
p386
aVand put it out to a group of a few hundred
p387
aVtrusted researchers so they could
p388
aVstudy that DNA and do penetration testing against it
p389
aVas a means of helping our leaders?
p390
aVOr what if we sent it out to a few thousand?
p391
aVOr, controversially, and not without its risks,
p392
aVwhat happens if we just gave it to the whole public?
p393
aVThen we could all be engaged in helping.
p394
aa(lp395
VWe've already seen examples of this working well.
p396
aVThe Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project
p397
aVis staffed by journalists and citizens
p398
aVwhere they are crowd-sourcing
p399
aVwhat dictators and terrorists are doing
p400
aVwith public funds around the world,
p401
aVand, in a more dramatic case,
p402
aVwe've seen in Mexico,
p403
aVa country that has been racked
p404
aVby 50,000 narcotics-related murders
p405
aVin the past six years.
p406
aVThey're killing so many people
p407
aVthey can't even afford to bury them all
p408
aVin anything but these unmarked graves
p409
aVlike this one outside of Ciudad Juarez.
p410
aVWhat can we do about this? The government has proven ineffective.
p411
aVSo in Mexico, citizens, at great risk to themselves,
p412
aVare fighting back to build an effective solution.
p413
aVThey're crowd-mapping the activities of the drug dealers.
p414
aa(lp415
VWhether or not you realize it,
p416
aVwe are at the dawn of a technological arms race,
p417
aVan arms race between people
p418
aVwho are using technology for good
p419
aVand those who are using it for ill.
p420
aVThe threat is serious, and the time to prepare for it is now.
p421
aVI can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are.
p422
aa(lp423
VMy personal belief is that,
p424
aVrather than having a small, elite force
p425
aVof highly trained government agents
p426
aVhere to protect us all,
p427
aVwe're much better off
p428
aVhaving average and ordinary citizens
p429
aVapproaching this problem as a group
p430
aVand seeing what we can do.
p431
aVIf we all do our part,
p432
aVI think we'll be in a much better space.
p433
aVThe tools to change the world
p434
aVare in everybody's hands.
p435
aVHow we use them is not just up to me,
p436
aVit's up to all of us.
p437
aa(lp438
VThis was a technology I would frequently deploy
p439
aVas a police officer.
p440
aVThis technology has become outdated in our current world.
p441
aVIt doesn't scale, it doesn't work globally,
p442
aVand it surely doesn't work virtually.
p443
aa(lp444
VWe've seen paradigm shifts in crime and terrorism.
p445
aVThey call for a shift to a more open form
p446
aVand a more participatory form of law enforcement.
p447
aVSo I invite you to join me.
p448
aVAfter all, public safety is too important to leave to the professionals.
p449
aa(lp450
VThank you. (Applause)
