VFresh out of college,
p4
aVI went to work for a consulting firm.
p5
aVDuring orientation, the leaders dished out advice.
p6
aVAmongst them was one pithy counsel I will never forget.
p7
aVHe told us, "Be easy to manage."
p8
aVConsidering how naïve I really was at the time,
p9
aVI took his advice to heart.
p10
aVI told myself,
p11
aV"Yes, I will be the ultimate team player.
p12
aVI will do everything I'm told.
p13
aVI will be easy to manage."
p14
aVIt wasn't until I arrived in graduate school
p15
aVand witnessed firsthand the criminal actions of scientists and engineers
p16
aVin the water crisis in Flint, Michigan
p17
aVthat I realized how dangerous and yet surprisingly common
p18
aVthis line of thinking really is.
p19
aa(lp20
VMake no mistake:
p21
aVthe Flint water crisis is one of the most egregious environmental injustices
p22
aVof our time.
p23
aVFor over 18 months,
p24
aV100,000 residents, including thousands of young children,
p25
aVwere exposed to contaminated drinking water with high levels of lead.
p26
aVLead is a potent neurotoxin
p27
aVwhich causes cognitive and developmental disabilities
p28
aVand is especially harmful to growing fetuses and young children.
p29
aVWe've known about its dangers since the Roman Empire.
p30
aVAmongst a whole host of health issues,
p31
aV12 people died by contracting Legionnaires' disease.
p32
aVFlint's water infrastructure \u2014
p33
aVthe complex network of underground pipes \u2014
p34
aVhas been severely damaged.
p35
aVAnd while the water quality is slowly improving
p36
aVand the pipes are being replaced now,
p37
aVmore than two years later,
p38
aVthe water is still not safe to drink.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo, people are still in shock.
p41
aVThey ask themselves,
p42
aV"How could this have happened?"
p43
aVThe short answer is: the crisis began when an emergency manager,
p44
aVappointed by Michigan's governor,
p45
aVdecided to switch their water source to a local river to save money.
p46
aVBut it continued for so long
p47
aVbecause scientists and engineers at government agencies
p48
aVin the state of Michigan and in the federal government
p49
aVdid not follow federal regulations for treating the water right.
p50
aVWhat was more,
p51
aVthey actively cheated on the law and orchestrated cover-ups.
p52
aVThey ridiculed residents asking for help,
p53
aVwhile publicly insisting that the brown, smelly water coming out of the tap
p54
aVwas safe to drink.
p55
aVThe system at the local, state and federal levels completely failed
p56
aVto protect our most vulnerable,
p57
aVand an entire population was left to fend for itself.
p58
aa(lp59
VNow, amidst this injustice, Flint residents were rallying together.
p60
aVAmongst them were some amazing women of Flint \u2014
p61
aVmothers concerned about their kids \u2014
p62
aVwho came together forming many grassroots coalitions,
p63
aVand these groups started protesting and demanding change.
p64
aVThe group also reached out to outside scientists for help,
p65
aVand a few responded.
p66
aVAmongst them was a guy named Miguel Del Toral,
p67
aVa water expert at the US EPA \u2014 the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014
p68
aVwho actually wrote this scientific memo
p69
aVand sent it to the state of Michigan and the federal government
p70
aVto bring their attention to this problem.
p71
aVHe was characterized a "rogue employee,"
p72
aVand silenced.
p73
aa(lp74
VIn collaboration with Flint residents,
p75
aVour research team here at Tech,
p76
aVof students and scientists led by professor Marc Edwards,
p77
aVconducted citywide testing
p78
aVto prove that Flint's water was indeed contaminated,
p79
aVeven toxic in some homes.
p80
aVWe substantiated what Flint had been screaming for months,
p81
aVand put it on the Internet for the world to see.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow, when I was getting involved,
p84
aVwhen I said yes to this,
p85
aVI had no idea what I was getting into.
p86
aVBut every second of this journey has been totally worth it.
p87
aVThis was science in service to the public.
p88
aVThis is what I came to graduate school for,
p89
aVand this is how I would rather spend my life.
p90
aVAnd so this coalition \u2014
p91
aVthis unlikely coalition of citizens, pastors, journalists and scientists \u2014
p92
aVcame together to uncover the truth using science, advocacy and activism.
p93
aa(lp94
VA local pediatrician figured out
p95
aVthat the instances of childhood lead poisoning had indeed doubled
p96
aVin Flint during the crisis.
p97
aVAnd the state of Michigan was forced to acknowledge the problem
p98
aVand take steps to correct it.
p99
aVThis group and many others got Flint's kids protected.
p100
aa(lp101
VA few months later,
p102
aVPresident Obama came in and declared a federal emergency,
p103
aVand now Flint is getting more than 600 million dollars
p104
aVin healthcare, nutrition, education
p105
aVand overhauling their water infrastructure.
p106
aVHowever, the arrogance and the callous disregard for public health
p107
aVshown by scientists and engineers at these government agencies
p108
aVis beyond belief.
p109
aVThese unhealthy cultures that are festering in these groups,
p110
aVwhere the focus is on meeting regulations and checking boxes
p111
aVas opposed to protecting public health,
p112
aVis just appalling.
p113
aVJust consider this email that an EPA employee wrote,
p114
aVwhere she goes,
p115
aV"I'm not so sure Flint is a community we want to go out on a limb for."
p116
aVThe dehumanization of an entire population could not be more obvious.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow, contrast that to the first canon of engineering,
p119
aVwhich, in my opinion, should be the first law of humanity:
p120
aV"To hold paramount the health, safety and welfare of the public,"
p121
aVabove all else.
p122
aVThis is the Hippocratic Oath we've rarely acknowledged,
p123
aVlet alone embraced.
p124
aVAnd so when scientists and engineers, very much like medical doctors,
p125
aVscrew up,
p126
aVpeople can get hurt \u2014
p127
aVeven die.
p128
aVIf our professionals and even students fail to get that,
p129
aVsociety pays a huge price.
p130
aa(lp131
VBuried deep in history lies a character I deeply admire \u2014
p132
aVan engineer named Peter Palchinsky.
p133
aVHe lived in the time of the Soviet Union.
p134
aVAnd Palchinsky repeatedly got in trouble for his radical honesty
p135
aVand willingness to point out major flaws in the Soviets' mindless pursuit
p136
aVof rapid industrialization.
p137
aVEveryone was expected to follow orders coming from the top.
p138
aVAnyone asking questions or offering feedback was unwelcome.
p139
aVThe Soviets had created the largest army of engineers the world had ever seen,
p140
aVand yet most of them were mere cogs in a gigantic machine heading for doom.
p141
aVPalchinsky, on the other hand, implored engineers
p142
aVto look at the economic, political and social consequences of their actions;
p143
aVin other words, be more public-focused.
p144
aVHis fearless voice of reason was seen as a threat
p145
aVto the political establishment,
p146
aVand Joseph Stalin had him executed in 1929.
p147
aa(lp148
VPalchinsky's view on technocrats is very different
p149
aVfrom one that is still very popular, still very common \u2014
p150
aVthat of a dispassionate researcher working in his ivory tower lab,
p151
aVor a nerdy engineer working in his cubicle.
p152
aVBrilliant, no doubt,
p153
aVyet somehow cut off from the world,
p154
aVshows little emotion \u2014
p155
aVkind of like Spock from "Star Trek," you know?
p156
aVThis guy.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Laughter)
p159
aa(lp160
VLet's try and do the Spock salute.
p161
aVI don't think I'll succeed ...
p162
aVSee, I can't be Spock.
p163
aVThank goodness I can't be Spock.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Laughter)
p166
aa(lp167
VI was reminded of this distinction because a recent article came out
p168
aVin a very reputed scientific journal,
p169
aVwhich kind of characterized our Flint work as driven by "youthful idealism,"
p170
aVand "Hollywood's dramatic sensibilities."
p171
aVIt asks scientists to protect their research funding and institutions
p172
aVat all costs, no matter how just the cause.
p173
aVAnd if you think you have to get involved in something,
p174
aVeven if it's an emergency,
p175
aVtry finding an activist group or an NGO,
p176
aVand obtain the full support of the academic community \u2014
p177
aVwhatever that means \u2014
p178
aVbefore you get involved.
p179
aVNot one mention of our moral and professional obligation
p180
aVof preventing harm to the public,
p181
aVor the fact that we have all this expertise,
p182
aVresources and, for some, even tenure
p183
aVto, you know, accomplish this task.
p184
aVI'm not saying every scientist should be an activist.
p185
aVThere are real and sometimes very painful consequences of speaking up.
p186
aVBut to denounce this idea, this possibility so completely
p187
aVso that you can protect research funding,
p188
aVsimply screams of self-serving cowardice,
p189
aVand these are not the ideals we would want to pass to our students.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd so you may think, "OK, all this sounds great,
p192
aVbut you'll never completely change organizational cultures,
p193
aVor imbibe mindsets in students and professionals
p194
aVto look at their work as a public good \u2014
p195
aVscience in service to the public."
p196
aVMaybe so.
p197
aVBut could a big reason for that be
p198
aVthat we are not training our students right?
p199
aVBecause if you look closely,
p200
aVour education system today is focused more on creating
p201
aVwhat ex-Yale professor Bill Deresiewicz calls "excellent sheep" \u2014
p202
aVyoung people who are smart and ambitious,
p203
aVand yet somehow risk-averse, timid, directionless
p204
aVand, sometimes, full of themselves.
p205
aa(lp206
VNow, kids ... you know,
p207
aVwe fell in love with science when we were kids,
p208
aVand yet we somehow spend most of our time during high school and college
p209
aVjust jumping through hoops
p210
aVand doing things so that we can polish our résumé
p211
aVinstead of sitting down
p212
aVand reflecting on what we want to do and who we want to be.
p213
aVAnd so,
p214
aVthe markers of empathy in our college graduates
p215
aVhave been dropping dramatically in the past two decades,
p216
aVwhile those of narcissism are on the rise.
p217
aa(lp218
VThere is also a growing culture of disengagement
p219
aVbetween engineering students and the public.
p220
aVWe are trained to build bridges and solve complex problems
p221
aVbut not how to think or live or be a citizen of this world.
p222
aVMy undergraduate years were explicit job preparation,
p223
aVand I cannot tell you how suffocating and painful it was at times.
p224
aVAnd so,
p225
aVsome people think the solution to great engineers, to great scientists,
p226
aVis more technical training.
p227
aVMaybe so.
p228
aVBut where are the discussions on ethical decision-making,
p229
aVor building character,
p230
aVor discerning right from wrong?
p231
aa(lp232
VConsider this project that I deeply love and admire.
p233
aVIt's called, "Heroic Imagination Project."
p234
aVA brainchild of Dr. Phil Zimbardo,
p235
aVfamous for the Stanford Prison Experiment,
p236
aVthis program seeks to train school-going children around the world
p237
aVto look at themselves as heroes-in-waiting,
p238
aVor heroes-in-training.
p239
aVSo, these young minds work over time to develop skills and virtues
p240
aVso that when the opportunity comes,
p241
aVno matter what that opportunity be,
p242
aVto stand up and do the right thing.
p243
aVIn other words,
p244
aVanyone can be a hero.
p245
aa(lp246
VThink about that idea for a second.
p247
aVWhy don't we teach science and engineering like that \u2014
p248
aVwhere heroism and public service are seen as key values,
p249
aVbecause indeed, it's often heroism
p250
aVthat is not only the antidote to public indifference,
p251
aVbut also to systemic evil like we saw in Flint.
p252
aa(lp253
VAnd so, dream with me
p254
aVwhat a 21st-century scientist slash engineer could look like:
p255
aVindividuals who are driven to master the sciences
p256
aVso that they can serve society,
p257
aVand are also aware
p258
aVof the tremendous power their knowledge and decisions have;
p259
aVfolks who are developing their moral courage at all times,
p260
aVand who realize that conflict and controversy
p261
aVare not necessarily bad things
p262
aVif our ultimate loyalty is to the public and the planet.
p263
aa(lp264
VThese are the people who will stand up like we did in Flint \u2014
p265
aVnot to be saviors or heroes in the media,
p266
aVbut altruistic and fundamentally good actors that you and I can trust.
p267
aVImagine fostering such a public-focused mindset
p268
aVin classes, on service trips and during activities
p269
aVduring college or even high school,
p270
aVso that these young minds will hold onto those ideals
p271
aVwhen they actually enter the real world,
p272
aVwhether that be consulting, academia, policy making \u2014
p273
aVor even becoming the president of a country.
p274
aa(lp275
VSome of mankind's greatest challenges lie ahead of us;
p276
aVcontaminated drinking water is just one example.
p277
aVWe could definitely use more \u2014
p278
aVnay, we desperately need more \u2014 compassionate upstanders
p279
aVand public-focused scientists and engineers
p280
aVwho will strive to the do right thing,
p281
aVand not be easy to manage.
p282
aa(lp283
VThank you.
