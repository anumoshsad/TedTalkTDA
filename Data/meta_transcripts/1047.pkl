VThere are two groups of women
p4
aVwhen it comes to screening mammography \u2014
p5
aVwomen in whom mammography works very well
p6
aVand has saved thousands of lives
p7
aVand women in whom it doesn't work well at all.
p8
aVDo you know which group you're in?
p9
aVIf you don't, you're not alone.
p10
aVBecause the breast has become
p11
aVa very political organ.
p12
aVThe truth has become lost
p13
aVin all the rhetoric
p14
aVcoming from the press, politicians,
p15
aVradiologists
p16
aVand medical imaging companies.
p17
aVI will do my best this morning
p18
aVto tell you what I think is the truth.
p19
aVBut first, my disclosures.
p20
aVI am not a breast cancer survivor.
p21
aVI'm not a radiologist.
p22
aVI don't have any patents,
p23
aVand I've never received any money from a medical imaging company,
p24
aVand I am not seeking your vote.

VWhat I am
p29
aVis a doctor of internal medicine
p30
aVwho became passionately interested in this topic
p31
aVabout 10 years ago
p32
aVwhen a patient asked me a question.
p33
aVShe came to see me
p34
aVafter discovering a breast lump.
p35
aVHer sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer
p36
aVin her 40s.
p37
aVShe and I were both very pregnant at that time,
p38
aVand my heart just ached for her,
p39
aVimagining how afraid she must be.
p40
aVFortunately, her lump proved to be benign.
p41
aVBut she asked me a question:
p42
aVhow confident was I
p43
aVthat I would find a tumor early on her mammogram
p44
aVif she developed one?
p45
aVSo I studied her mammogram,
p46
aVand I reviewed the radiology literature,
p47
aVand I was shocked to discover
p48
aVthat, in her case,
p49
aVour chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram
p50
aVwere less than the toss of a coin.
p51
aa(lp52
VYou may recall a year ago
p53
aVwhen a firestorm erupted
p54
aVafter the United States Preventive Services Task Force
p55
aVreviewed the world's mammography screening literature
p56
aVand issued a guideline
p57
aVrecommending against screening mammograms
p58
aVin women in their 40s.
p59
aVNow everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force,
p60
aVeven though most of them weren't in anyway familiar
p61
aVwith the mammography studies.
p62
aVIt took the Senate just 17 days
p63
aVto ban the use of the guidelines
p64
aVin determining insurance coverage.
p65
aVRadiologists were outraged
p66
aVby the guidelines.
p67
aVThe pre-eminent mammographer in the United States
p68
aVissued the following quote
p69
aVto the Washington Post.
p70
aVThe radiologists were, in turn, criticized
p71
aVfor protecting their own financial self-interest.
p72
aVBut in my view,
p73
aVthe radiologists are heroes.
p74
aVThere's a shortage of radiologists
p75
aVqualified to read mammograms,
p76
aVand that's because mammograms are one of the most complex
p77
aVof all radiology studies to interpret,
p78
aVand because radiologists
p79
aVare sued more often
p80
aVover missed breast cancer
p81
aVthan any other cause.
p82
aVBut that very fact is telling.
p83
aa(lp84
VWhere there is this much legal smoke,
p85
aVthere is likely to be some fire.
p86
aVThe factor most responsible for that fire
p87
aVis breast density.
p88
aVBreast density refers to the relative amount of fat \u2014
p89
aVpictured here in yellow \u2014
p90
aVversus connective and epithelial tissues \u2014
p91
aVpictured in pink.
p92
aVAnd that proportion
p93
aVis primarily genetically determined.
p94
aVTwo-thirds of women in their 40s
p95
aVhave dense breast tissue,
p96
aVwhich is why mammography doesn't work as well in them.
p97
aVAnd although breast density generally declines with age,
p98
aVup to a third of women
p99
aVretain dense breast tissue
p100
aVfor years after menopause.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo how do you know if your breasts are dense?
p103
aVWell, you need to read the details
p104
aVof your mammography report.
p105
aVRadiologists classify breast density
p106
aVinto four categories
p107
aVbased on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram.
p108
aVIf the breast is less than 25 percent dense,
p109
aVthat's called fatty-replaced.
p110
aVThe next category
p111
aVis scattered fibroglandular densities,
p112
aVfollowed by heterogeneously dense
p113
aVand extremely dense.
p114
aVAnd breasts that fall into these two categories
p115
aVare considered dense.
p116
aVThe problem with breast density
p117
aVis that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing.
p118
aVBoth tumors and dense breast tissue
p119
aVappear white on a mammogram,
p120
aVand the X-ray often can't distinguish between the two.
p121
aVSo it's easy to see this tumor
p122
aVin the upper part of this fatty breast.
p123
aVBut imagine how difficult it would be
p124
aVto find that tumor in this dense breast.
p125
aVThat's why mammograms find
p126
aVover 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts,
p127
aVbut as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts.
p128
aa(lp129
VNow it's bad enough that breast density
p130
aVmakes it hard to find a cancer,
p131
aVbut it turns out
p132
aVthat it's also a powerful predictor
p133
aVof your risk for breast cancer.
p134
aVIt's a stronger risk factor
p135
aVthan having a mother or a sister with breast cancer.
p136
aVAt the time my patient posed this question to me,
p137
aVbreast density was an obscure topic
p138
aVin the radiology literature,
p139
aVand very few women having mammograms,
p140
aVor the physicians ordering them,
p141
aVknew about this.
p142
aVBut what else could I offer her?
p143
aa(lp144
VMammograms have been around since the 1960's,
p145
aVand it's changed very little.
p146
aVThere have been surprisingly few innovations,
p147
aVuntil digital mammography was approved
p148
aVin 2000.
p149
aVDigital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast,
p150
aVbut the images
p151
aVcan be stored and manipulated digitally,
p152
aVjust like we can with a digital camera.
p153
aVThe U.S. has invested
p154
aVfour billion dollars
p155
aVconverting to digital mammography equipment,
p156
aVand what have we gained from that investment?
p157
aVIn a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars,
p158
aVdigital mammography was found
p159
aVto be no better over all
p160
aVthan traditional mammography,
p161
aVand in fact, it was worse in older women.
p162
aVBut it was better in one group,
p163
aVand that was women under 50
p164
aVwho were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts,
p165
aVand in those women,
p166
aVdigital mammography found twice as many cancers,
p167
aVbut it still only found 60 percent.
p168
aVSo digital mammography
p169
aVhas been a giant leap forward
p170
aVfor manufacturers
p171
aVof digital mammography equipment,
p172
aVbut it's been a very small step forward for
p173
aVwomankind.
p174
aa(lp175
VWhat about ultrasound?
p176
aVUltrasound generates more biopsies
p177
aVthat are unnecessary relative to other technologies,
p178
aVso it's not widely used.
p179
aVAnd MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors,
p180
aVbut it's also very expensive.
p181
aVIf we think about disruptive technology,
p182
aVwe see an almost ubiquitous pattern
p183
aVof the technology getting smaller and less expensive.
p184
aVThink about iPods compared to stereos.
p185
aVBut it's the exact opposite in health care.
p186
aVThe machines get ever bigger
p187
aVand ever more expensive.
p188
aVScreening the average young woman with an MRI
p189
aVis kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer.
p190
aVIt's just way too much equipment.
p191
aVOne MRI scan
p192
aVcosts 10 times what a digital mammogram costs.
p193
aVAnd sooner or later, we're going to have to accept the fact
p194
aVthat health care innovation
p195
aVcan't always come at a much higher price.
p196
aa(lp197
VMalcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker
p198
aVon innovation,
p199
aVand he made the case that scientific discoveries
p200
aVare rarely the product of one individual's genius.
p201
aVRather, big ideas can be orchestrated,
p202
aVif you can simply gather
p203
aVpeople with different perspectives in a room
p204
aVand get them to talk about things
p205
aVthat they don't ordinarily talk about.
p206
aVIt's like the essence of TED.
p207
aVHe quotes one innovator who says,
p208
aV"The only time a physician and a physicist get together
p209
aVis when the physicist gets sick."
p210
aV(Laughter)
p211
aVThis makes no sense,
p212
aVbecause physicians have all kinds of problems
p213
aVthat they don't realize have solutions.
p214
aVAnd physicists have all kinds of solutions for things
p215
aVthat they don't realize are problems.
p216
aVNow, take a look at this cartoon
p217
aVthat accompanied Gladwell's article,
p218
aVand tell me if you see something disturbing
p219
aVabout this depiction of innovative thinkers.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VSo if you will allow me a little creative license,
p224
aVI will tell you the story
p225
aVof the serendipitous collision
p226
aVof my patient's problem
p227
aVwith a physicist's solution.
p228
aVShortly after her visit,
p229
aVI was introduced to a nuclear physicist
p230
aVat Mayo
p231
aVnamed Michael O'Conner,
p232
aVwho was a specialist in cardiac imaging,
p233
aVsomething I had nothing to do with.
p234
aVAnd he happened to tell me
p235
aVabout a conference he'd just returned from in Israel,
p236
aVwhere they were talking about a new type of gamma detector.
p237
aVNow gamma imaging has been around for a long time
p238
aVto image the heart,
p239
aVand it had even been tried to image the breast.
p240
aVBut the problem was
p241
aVthat the gamma detectors
p242
aVwere these huge, bulky tubes,
p243
aVand they were filled with these scintillating crystals,
p244
aVand you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast
p245
aVto find small tumors.
p246
aVBut the potential advantage was
p247
aVthat gamma rays, unlike X-rays,
p248
aVare not influenced by breast density.
p249
aVBut this technology
p250
aVcould not find tumors when they're small,
p251
aVand finding a small tumor is critical for survival.
p252
aVIf you can find a tumor
p253
aVwhen it's less than a centimeter,
p254
aVsurvival exceeds 90 percent,
p255
aVbut drops off rapidly
p256
aVas tumor size increases.
p257
aVBut Michael told me about
p258
aVa new type of gamma detector that he'd seen,
p259
aVand this is it.
p260
aVIt's made
p261
aVnot of a bulky tube,
p262
aVbut of a thin layer of a semiconductor material
p263
aVthat serves as the gamma detector.
p264
aVAnd I started talking to him
p265
aVabout this problem with breast density,
p266
aVand we realized that we might be able to get this detector
p267
aVclose enough around the breast
p268
aVto actually find small tumors.
p269
aa(lp270
VSo after putting together
p271
aVa grid of these cubes with tape \u2014
p272
aV(Laughter)
p273
aV\u2014 Michael hacked off the X-ray plate
p274
aVof a mammography machine
p275
aVthat was about to be thrown out,
p276
aVand we attached the new detector,
p277
aVand we decided to call this machine
p278
aVMolecular Breast Imaging, or MBI.
p279
aVThis is an image from our first patient.
p280
aVAnd you can see, using the old gamma technology,
p281
aVthat it just looked like noise.
p282
aVBut using our new detector,
p283
aVwe could begin to see the outline of a tumor.
p284
aa(lp285
VSo here we were, a nuclear physicist,
p286
aVan internist,
p287
aVsoon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer,
p288
aVand two radiologists,
p289
aVand we were trying to take on
p290
aVthe entrenched world of mammography
p291
aVwith a machine that was held together by duct tape.
p292
aVTo say that we faced
p293
aVhigh doses of skepticism
p294
aVin those early years
p295
aVis just a huge understatement,
p296
aVbut we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work
p297
aVthat we chipped away with incremental modifications
p298
aVto this system.
p299
aVThis is our current detector.
p300
aVAnd you can see that it looks a lot different.
p301
aVThe duct tape is gone,
p302
aVand we added a second detector on top of the breast,
p303
aVwhich has further improved our tumor detection.
p304
aa(lp305
VSo how does this work?
p306
aVThe patient receives an injection of a radio tracer
p307
aVthat's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells,
p308
aVbut not by normal cells,
p309
aVand this is the key difference from mammography.
p310
aVMammography relies on differences
p311
aVin the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue,
p312
aVand we've seen that those differences
p313
aVcan be obscured in a dense breast.
p314
aVBut MBI exploits
p315
aVthe different molecular behavior of tumors,
p316
aVand therefore, it's impervious to breast density.
p317
aVAfter the injection,
p318
aVthe patient's breast is placed between the detectors.
p319
aVAnd if you've ever had a mammogram \u2014
p320
aVif you're old enough to have had a mammogram \u2014
p321
aVyou know what comes next:
p322
aVpain.
p323
aVYou may be surprised to know
p324
aVthat mammography is the only radiologic study
p325
aVthat's regulated by federal law,
p326
aVand the law requires
p327
aVthat the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery
p328
aVcome down on your breast during this study.
p329
aVBut with MBI,
p330
aVwe use just light, pain-free compression.
p331
aV(Applause)
p332
aVAnd the detector
p333
aVthen transmits the image to the computer.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo here's an example.
p336
aVYou can see, on the right, a mammogram
p337
aVshowing a faint tumor,
p338
aVthe edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue.
p339
aVBut the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly,
p340
aVas well as a second tumor,
p341
aVwhich profoundly influence that patient's surgical options.
p342
aVIn this example, although the mammogram found one tumor,
p343
aVwe were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors \u2014
p344
aVone is small as three millimeters.
p345
aa(lp346
VOur big break came in 2004.
p347
aVAfter we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors,
p348
aVwe used these images
p349
aVto submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.
p350
aVAnd we were elated when they took a chance
p351
aVon a team of completely unknown investigators
p352
aVand funded us to study
p353
aV1,000 women with dense breasts,
p354
aVcomparing a screening mammogram to an MBI.
p355
aVOf the tumors that we found,
p356
aVmammography found
p357
aVonly 25 percent of those tumors.
p358
aVMBI found 83 percent.
p359
aVHere's an example from that screening study.
p360
aVThe digital mammogram was read as normal
p361
aVand shows lots of dense tissue,
p362
aVbut the MBI shows an area of intense uptake,
p363
aVwhich correlated with a two-centimeter tumor.
p364
aVIn this case, a one-centimeter tumor.
p365
aVAnd in this case,
p366
aVa 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo,
p367
aVwho had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young,
p368
aVwanted to enroll in our study.
p369
aVAnd her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue,
p370
aVbut her MBI showed an area
p371
aVof worrisome uptake,
p372
aVwhich we can also see on a color image.
p373
aVAnd this corresponded
p374
aVto a tumor the size of a golf ball.
p375
aVBut fortunately it was removed
p376
aVbefore it had spread to her lymph nodes.
p377
aa(lp378
VSo now that we knew that this technology
p379
aVcould find three times more tumors in a dense breast,
p380
aVwe had to solve one very important problem.
p381
aVWe had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose,
p382
aVand we have spent the last three years
p383
aVmaking modifications to every aspect of the imaging system
p384
aVto allow this.
p385
aVAnd I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation
p386
aVthat is equivalent to the effective dose
p387
aVfrom one digital mammogram.
p388
aVAnd at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study,
p389
aVand this image from three weeks ago
p390
aVin a 67-year-old woman
p391
aVshows a normal digital mammogram,
p392
aVbut an MBI image
p393
aVshowing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer.
p394
aVSo this is not just young women that it's benefiting.
p395
aVIt's also older women with dense tissue.
p396
aVAnd we're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose
p397
aVthat's used in any other type of gamma technology.
p398
aa(lp399
VMBI generates four images per breast.
p400
aVMRI generates over a thousand.
p401
aVIt takes a radiologist
p402
aVyears of specialty training
p403
aVto become expert in differentiating
p404
aVthe normal anatomic detail
p405
aVfrom the worrisome finding.
p406
aVBut I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room
p407
aVcan find the tumor on the MBI image.
p408
aVBut this is why MBI
p409
aVis so potentially disruptive \u2014
p410
aVit's as accurate as MRI,
p411
aVit's far less complex to interpret,
p412
aVand it's a fraction of the cost.
p413
aVBut you can understand why there may be
p414
aVforces in the breast-imaging world
p415
aVwho prefer the status quo.
p416
aa(lp417
VAfter achieving what we felt were remarkable results,
p418
aVour manuscript was rejected
p419
aVby four journals.
p420
aVAfter the fourth rejection,
p421
aVwe requested reconsideration of the manuscript,
p422
aVbecause we strongly suspected
p423
aVthat one of the reviewers who had rejected it
p424
aVhad a financial conflict of interest
p425
aVin a competing technology.
p426
aVOur manuscript was then accepted
p427
aVand will be published later this month
p428
aVin the journal Radiology.
p429
aV(Applause)
p430
aVWe still need to complete the screening study using the low dose,
p431
aVand then our findings will need to be replicated
p432
aVat other institutions,
p433
aVand this could take five or more years.
p434
aVIf this technology is widely adopted,
p435
aVI will not benefit financially in any way,
p436
aVand that is very important to me,
p437
aVbecause it allows me to continue to tell you the truth.
p438
aVBut I recognize \u2014
p439
aV(Applause)
p440
aVI recognize that the adoption of this technology
p441
aVwill depend as much on economic
p442
aVand political forces
p443
aVas it will on the soundness of the science.
p444
aa(lp445
VThe MBI unit has now been FDA approved,
p446
aVbut it's not yet widely available.
p447
aVSo until something is available
p448
aVfor women with dense breasts,
p449
aVthere are things that you should know
p450
aVto protect yourself.
p451
aVFirst, know your density.
p452
aVNinety percent of women don't,
p453
aVand 95 percent of women don't know
p454
aVthat it increases your breast cancer risk.
p455
aVThe State of Connecticut became the first and only state
p456
aVto mandate that women receive notification
p457
aVof their breast density
p458
aVafter a mammogram.
p459
aVI was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging
p460
aVlast week in Chicago,
p461
aVand I was stunned that there was a heated debate
p462
aVas to whether we should be telling women
p463
aVwhat their breast density is.
p464
aVOf course we should.
p465
aVAnd if you don't know, please ask your doctor
p466
aVor read the details of your mammography report.
p467
aVSecond, if you're pre-menopausal,
p468
aVtry to schedule your mammogram
p469
aVin the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle,
p470
aVwhen breast density is relatively lower.
p471
aVThird, if you notice a persistent change in your breast,
p472
aVinsist on additional imaging.
p473
aVAnd fourth and most important,
p474
aVthe mammography debate will rage on,
p475
aVbut I do believe that all women 40 and older
p476
aVshould have an annual mammogram.
p477
aa(lp478
VMammography isn't perfect,
p479
aVbut it's the only test that's been proven
p480
aVto reduce mortality from breast cancer.
p481
aVBut this mortality banner
p482
aVis the very sword
p483
aVwhich mammography's most ardent advocates use
p484
aVto deter innovation.
p485
aVSome women who develop breast cancer
p486
aVdie from it many years later,
p487
aVand most women, thankfully, survive.
p488
