VMany of you could ask the question, you know,
p4
aVwhy is a flying car, or maybe more accurately,
p5
aVa roadable aircraft, possible at this time?
p6
aVA number of years ago,
p7
aVMr. Ford predicted that flying cars
p8
aVof some form would be available.
p9
aVNow, 60 years later,
p10
aVI'm here to tell you why it's possible.
p11
aVWhen I was about five years old,
p12
aVnot very much \u2014 about a year after
p13
aVMr. Ford made his predictions,
p14
aVI was living in a rural part of Canada,
p15
aVon the side of a mountain in a very isolated area.
p16
aVGetting to school, for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age,
p17
aVthrough the Canadian winter, was not a pleasant experience.
p18
aVIt was a trying and scary thing
p19
aVfor a young kid to be going through.
p20
aa(lp21
VAt the end of my first year in school, in the summer of that year,
p22
aVI discovered a couple hummingbirds
p23
aVthat were caught in a shed near my home.
p24
aVThey'd worn themselves out,
p25
aVbeating themselves against the window,
p26
aVand, well, they were easy to capture.
p27
aVI took them outside and as I let them go, that split second, even though they were very tired,
p28
aVthat second I let them go they hovered for a second,
p29
aVthen zipped off into the distance.
p30
aVI thought, what a great way to get to school.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Laughter)
p33
aa(lp34
VFor a kid at that age, this was like infinite speed, disappearing,
p35
aVand I was very inspired by that.
p36
aVAnd so the next \u2014 over the next
p37
aVsix decades, believe it or not,
p38
aVI've built a number of aircraft,
p39
aVwith the goal of creating something that could do for you, or me,
p40
aVwhat the hummingbird does,
p41
aVand give you that flexibility.
p42
aVI've called this vehicle, generically, a volantor,
p43
aVafter the Latin word "volant," meaning,
p44
aVto fly in a light, nimble manner.
p45
aVVolantor-like helicopter, perhaps.
p46
aVThe FAA, the controlling body above all,
p47
aVcalls it a "powered lift aircraft."
p48
aVAnd they've actually issued a pilot's license \u2014
p49
aVa powerlift pilot's license \u2014 for this type of aircraft.
p50
aVIt's closer than you think. It's kind of remarkable when you consider that
p51
aVthere are no operational powered lift aircraft.
p52
aVSo for once, perhaps, the government is ahead of itself.
p53
aa(lp54
VThe press calls my particular volantor a "Skycar."
p55
aVThis is a little bit earlier version of it,
p56
aVthat's why it's given the X designation,
p57
aVbut it's a four-passenger aircraft
p58
aVthat could take off vertically, like a helicopter \u2014
p59
aVtherefore it doesn't need an airfield.
p60
aVOn the ground, it's powered electrically.
p61
aVIt's actually classified as a motorcycle
p62
aVbecause of the three wheels, which is a great asset
p63
aVbecause it allows you, theoretically, to use this on the highways
p64
aVin most states, and actually in all cities.
p65
aVSo that's an asset because if you've got to deal with the crash protection issues
p66
aVof the automobile, forget it \u2014 you're never going to fly it.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VOne could say that a helicopter
p71
aVdoes pretty much what the hummingbird does,
p72
aVand gets around in much the same way, and it's true,
p73
aVbut a helicopter is a very complex device.
p74
aVIt's expensive \u2014
p75
aVso expensive that very few people could own or use it.
p76
aVIt's often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity,
p77
aVas a series of parts \u2014 a large number of parts \u2014
p78
aVflying in formation.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VAnother difference, and I have to describe this,
p83
aVbecause it's very personal,
p84
aVanother great difference between the helicopter
p85
aVand the volantor \u2014
p86
aVin my case the Skycar volantor \u2014
p87
aVis the experience that I've had
p88
aVin flying both of those.
p89
aVIn a helicopter you feel \u2014 and it's still a remarkable sensation \u2014
p90
aVyou feel like you're being hauled up from above
p91
aVby a vibrating crane.
p92
aVWhen you get in the Skycar \u2014 and I can tell you,
p93
aVthere's only one other person that's flown it, but he had the same sensation \u2014
p94
aVyou really feel like you're being lifted up
p95
aVby a magic carpet,
p96
aVwithout any vibration whatsoever. The sensation is unbelievable.
p97
aVAnd it's been a great motivator.
p98
aVI only get to fly this vehicle occasionally,
p99
aVand only when I can persuade my stockholders
p100
aVto let me do so,
p101
aVbut it's still one of those wonderful experiences
p102
aVthat reward you for all that time.
p103
aa(lp104
VWhat we really need is something to replace the automobile
p105
aVfor those 50-plus mile trips.
p106
aVVery few people realize that 50 mile-plus trips
p107
aVmake up 85 percent of the miles traveled in America.
p108
aVIf we can get rid of that,
p109
aVthen the highways will now be useful to you,
p110
aVas contrasted by what's happening
p111
aVin many parts of the world today.
p112
aVOn this next slide, is an interesting history
p113
aVof what we really have seen in infrastructure,
p114
aVbecause whether I give you a perfect Skycar,
p115
aVthe perfect vehicle for use, it's going to have very little value to you
p116
aVunless you've got a system to use it in.
p117
aVI'm sure any of you have asked the question,
p118
aVyeah, are there great things up there \u2014 what am I going to do, get up there?
p119
aVIt's bad enough on a highway, what's it going to be like to be in the air?
p120
aVThis world that you're going to be talking about tomorrow
p121
aVis going to be completely integrated. You're not going to be a pilot,
p122
aVyou're going to be a passenger.
p123
aVAnd it's the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes forward.
p124
aa(lp125
VI can tell you, technically we can build Skycars \u2014
p126
aVmy God, we went to the moon!
p127
aVThe technology there was much more difficult than what I'm dealing with here.
p128
aVBut we have to have these priority changes,
p129
aVwe have to have infrastructure to go with this.
p130
aVHistorically you see that we got around
p131
aV200 years ago by canals,
p132
aVand as that system disappeared, were replaced by railroads.
p133
aVAs that disappeared we came in with highways.
p134
aVBut if you look at that top corner \u2014 the highway system \u2014
p135
aVyou see where we are today. Highways are no longer being built,
p136
aVand that's a fact. You won't see any additional highways
p137
aVin the next 10 years.
p138
aVHowever, the next 10 years, if like the last 10 years,
p139
aVwe're going to see 30 percent more traffic.
p140
aVAnd where is that going to lead you to?
p141
aVSo the issue then, I've often asked, is
p142
aVwhen is it going to happen?
p143
aa(lp144
VWhen are we going to be able to have these vehicles?
p145
aVAnd of course, if you ask me, I'm going to give you a really optimistic view.
p146
aVAfter all, I've been spending 60 years here believing it's going to happen tomorrow.
p147
aVSo, I'm not going to quote myself on this.
p148
aVI'd prefer to quote someone else,
p149
aVwho testified with me before Congress,
p150
aVand in his position as head of NASA
p151
aVput forward this particular vision
p152
aVof the future of this type of aircraft.
p153
aVNow I would argue, actually, if you look at the fact that on the highways today,
p154
aVyou're only averaging about 30 miles per hour \u2014
p155
aVon average, according to the DOT \u2014
p156
aVthe Skycar travels at over 300 miles an hour,
p157
aVup to 25,000 feet.
p158
aVAnd so, in effect, you could see perhaps a tenfold increase
p159
aVin the ability to get around
p160
aVas far as speed is concerned.
p161
aa(lp162
VUnbeknownst to many of you,
p163
aVthe highway in the sky that I'm talking about here
p164
aVhas been under construction for 10 years.
p165
aVIt makes use of the GPS \u2014 you're familiar with GPS in your automobile,
p166
aVbut you may not be familiar with the fact that there's a GPS U.S.,
p167
aVthere's a Russian GPS,
p168
aVand there's a new GPS system
p169
aVgoing to Europe, called Galileo.
p170
aVWith those three systems,
p171
aVyou have what is always necessary \u2014
p172
aVa level of redundancy that says,
p173
aVif one system fails, you'll still have a way
p174
aVto make sure that you're being controlled.
p175
aVBecause if you're in this world, where computers are controlling what you're doing,
p176
aVit's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you.
p177
aa(lp178
VHow would a trip in a Skycar work?
p179
aVWell, you can't right now
p180
aVtake off from your home because it's too noisy.
p181
aVI mean to be able to take off from your home, you'd have to be extremely quiet.
p182
aVBut it's still fairly quiet.
p183
aVYou'd motor, electrically, to a vertiport,
p184
aVwhich may be a few blocks, maybe even a few miles away.
p185
aVThis is clearly, as I said earlier, a roadable aircraft,
p186
aVand you're not going to spend that much time on the road.
p187
aVAfter all, if you can fly like that,
p188
aVwhy are you going to drive around on a highway?
p189
aVGo to a local vertiport,
p190
aVplug in your destination,
p191
aVdelivered almost like a passenger.
p192
aVYou can play computer games, you can sleep, you can read on the way.
p193
aVThis is the world \u2014 there won't be you as a pilot. And I know the pilots in the audience aren't going to like that \u2014
p194
aVand I've had a lot of bad feedback
p195
aVfrom people who want to be up there, flying around
p196
aVand experiencing that.
p197
aVAnd of course, I suppose like recreational parks you can still do that.
p198
aVBut the vehicle itself is going to be a very, very controlled environment.
p199
aVOr it's going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system.
p200
aa(lp201
VWe flew the first vehicle for the international press
p202
aVin 1965, when I really got it started.
p203
aVI was a professor at the U.C. Davis System,
p204
aVand I got a lot of excitement around this,
p205
aVand I was able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time.
p206
aVAnd then through the various years
p207
aVwe invented various vehicles.
p208
aVActually the critical point was in 1989,
p209
aVwhen we demonstrated the stability of this vehicle \u2014
p210
aVhow completely stable it was in all circumstances,
p211
aVwhich is of course very critical.
p212
aVStill not a practical vehicle during all of this,
p213
aVbut moving in the right direction, we believe.
p214
aVFinally, in the early part of \u2014
p215
aVor actually the middle of 2002,
p216
aVwe flew the 400 \u2014 M400, which was the four-passenger vehicle.
p217
aVIn this case here, we're flying it remotely, as we always did at the beginning.
p218
aVAnd we had very small power plants in it at this time.
p219
aVWe are now installing larger powerplants,
p220
aVwhich will make it possible for me to get back on board.
p221
aa(lp222
VA vertical-takeoff aircraft
p223
aVis not the safest vehicle during the test flight program.
p224
aVThere's an old adage that applied for the years
p225
aVbetween 1950s and 1970s,
p226
aVwhen every aeronautical company
p227
aVwas working on vertical-takeoff aircraft.
p228
aVA vertical-takeoff aircraft
p229
aVneeds an artificial stabilization system \u2014
p230
aVthat's essential.
p231
aVAt least for the hover,
p232
aVand the low-speed flight.
p233
aVIf that single-stability system,
p234
aVthat brain that flies that aircraft, fails, or if the engine fails,
p235
aVthat vehicle crashes. There is no option to that.
p236
aVAnd the adage that I'm referring to,
p237
aVthat applied at that time,
p238
aVwas that nothing comes down faster
p239
aVthan a VTOL aircraft upside down.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VThat's a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots.
p244
aVIn fact, the aircraft companies gave up on
p245
aVvertical-takeoff aircraft
p246
aVmore or less for a number of years.
p247
aVAnd there's really only one operational aircraft in the world today
p248
aVthat's a vertical-takeoff aircraft \u2014 as distinct from a helicopter \u2014
p249
aVand that's the Hawker Harrier jump jet.
p250
aVA vertical-takeoff aircraft,
p251
aVlike the hummingbird,
p252
aVhas a very high metabolism,
p253
aVwhich means it requires a lot of energy.
p254
aVGetting that energy is very, very difficult. It all comes down
p255
aVto that power plant \u2014 how to get a large amount of power in a small package.
p256
aa(lp257
VFortunately, Dr. Felix Wankel
p258
aVinvented the rotary engine.
p259
aVA very unique engine \u2014 it's round,
p260
aVit's small, it's vibration-free.
p261
aVIt fits exactly where we need to fit it,
p262
aVright in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system \u2014
p263
aVvery critical. In fact that engine \u2014
p264
aVfor those who are into the automobile \u2014
p265
aVknow that it recently is applied to the RX8 \u2014
p266
aVthe Mazda.
p267
aVAnd that sportscar won Sports Car of the Year.
p268
aVWonderful engine.
p269
aVIn that application, it generates one horsepower per pound,
p270
aVwhich is twice as good as your car engine today,
p271
aVbut only half of what we need.
p272
aVMy company has spent 35 years
p273
aVand many millions of dollars taking that rotary engine,
p274
aVwhich was invented in the late '50s, and getting it to the point that we get
p275
aVover two horsepower per pound, reliably, and critical.
p276
aVWe actually get 175 horsepower
p277
aVinto one cubic foot.
p278
aVWe have eight engines in this vehicle.
p279
aVWe have four computers. We have two parachutes.
p280
aa(lp281
VRedundancy is the critical issue here.
p282
aVIf you want to stay alive you've got to have backups.
p283
aVAnd we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine,
p284
aVand continued to hover.
p285
aVThe computers back up each other. There's a voting system \u2014
p286
aVif one computer is not agreeing with the other three,
p287
aVit's kicked out of the system.
p288
aVAnd then you have three \u2014 you still have the triple redundancy.
p289
aVIf one of those fails, you still have a second chance.
p290
aVIf you stick around, then good luck.
p291
aVThere won't be a third chance.
p292
aVThe parachutes are there \u2014 hopefully,
p293
aVmore for psychological than real reasons, but
p294
aVthey will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Laughter)
p297
aa(lp298
VI'd like to show you an animation in this next one,
p299
aVwhich is one element
p300
aVof the Skycar's use,
p301
aVbut it's one that demonstrates how it could be used.
p302
aVYou could think of it personally in your own terms,
p303
aVof how you might use it.
p304
aVVideo: Skycar dispatched, launch rescue vehicle for San Francisco.
p305
aVPaul Moller: I believe that personal transportation
p306
aVin something like the Skycar,
p307
aVprobably in another volantor form as well,
p308
aVwill be a significant part of our lives,
p309
aVas Dr. Goldin says, within the next 10 years.
p310
aVAnd it's going to change the demographics in a very significant way.
p311
aVIf you can live 75 miles from San Francisco and get there in 15 minutes,
p312
aVyou're going to sell your 700,000-dollar apartment,
p313
aVbuy an upscale home on the side of a mountain,
p314
aVbuy a Skycar,
p315
aVwhich I think would be priced at that time perhaps
p316
aVin the area of 100,000 dollars, put money in the bank ...
p317
aVthat's a very significant incentive for getting out of San Francisco.
p318
aVBut you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell.
p319
aa(lp320
V(Laughter)
p321
aa(lp322
VDeveloping the Skycar has been a real challenge.
p323
aVObviously I'm dependent on a lot of other people
p324
aVbelieving in what I'm doing \u2014 both financially and in technical help.
p325
aVAnd that has \u2014
p326
aVyou run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you're doing,
p327
aVand a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing.
p328
aVI characterized this emerging technology
p329
aVin an aphorism,
p330
aVas it's described,
p331
aVwhich really talks about what I've experienced,
p332
aVand I'm sure what other people may have experienced
p333
aVin emerging technologies.
p334
aa(lp335
VThere's an interesting poll that came out recently
p336
aVunder NAS \u2014
p337
aVI think it's MSNBC \u2014
p338
aVin which they asked the question,
p339
aV"Are you in the market for a volantor?"
p340
aVTwenty-three percent said, "Yes, as soon as possible."
p341
aVForty-seven percent \u2014 yes, as soon as they could \u2014 price could come down.
p342
aVTwenty-three percent said, "As soon as it's proven safe."
p343
aVOnly seven percent said
p344
aVthat they wouldn't consider buying a Skycar.
p345
aVI'm encouraged by that. At least it makes me feel like,
p346
aVto some extent, it is becoming self-evident.
p347
aVThat we need an alternative to the automobile,
p348
aVat least for those 50-mile trips and more,
p349
aVso that the highways become usable in today's world.
p350
aVThank you.
