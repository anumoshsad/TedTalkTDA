VHow do you observe something you can't see?
p4
aVThis is the basic question of somebody who's interested
p5
aVin finding and studying black holes.
p6
aVBecause black holes are objects
p7
aVwhose pull of gravity is so intense
p8
aVthat nothing can escape it, not even light,
p9
aVso you can't see it directly.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo, my story today about black holes
p12
aVis about one particular black hole.
p13
aVI'm interested in finding whether or not
p14
aVthere is a really massive, what we like to call
p15
aV"supermassive" black hole at the center of our galaxy.
p16
aVAnd the reason this is interesting is that
p17
aVit gives us an opportunity to prove
p18
aVwhether or not these exotic objects really exist.
p19
aVAnd second, it gives us the opportunity
p20
aVto understand how these supermassive black holes
p21
aVinteract with their environment,
p22
aVand to understand how they affect the formation and evolution
p23
aVof the galaxies which they reside in.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo, to begin with,
p26
aVwe need to understand what a black hole is
p27
aVso we can understand the proof of a black hole.
p28
aVSo, what is a black hole?
p29
aVWell, in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object,
p30
aVbecause there are only three characteristics that you can describe:
p31
aVthe mass,
p32
aVthe spin, and the charge.
p33
aVAnd I'm going to only talk about the mass.
p34
aVSo, in that sense, it's a very simple object.
p35
aVBut in another sense, it's an incredibly complicated object
p36
aVthat we need relatively exotic physics to describe,
p37
aVand in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding
p38
aVof the universe.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut today, the way I want you to understand a black hole,
p41
aVfor the proof of a black hole,
p42
aVis to think of it as an object
p43
aVwhose mass is confined to zero volume.
p44
aVSo, despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about
p45
aVan object that's supermassive,
p46
aVand I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment,
p47
aVit has no finite size.
p48
aVSo, this is a little tricky.
p49
aa(lp50
VBut fortunately there is a finite size that you can see,
p51
aVand that's known as the Schwarzschild radius.
p52
aVAnd that's named after the guy who recognized
p53
aVwhy it was such an important radius.
p54
aVThis is a virtual radius, not reality; the black hole has no size.
p55
aVSo why is it so important?
p56
aVIt's important because it tells us
p57
aVthat any object can become a black hole.
p58
aVThat means you, your neighbor, your cellphone,
p59
aVthe auditorium can become a black hole
p60
aVif you can figure out how to compress it down
p61
aVto the size of the Schwarzschild radius.
p62
aa(lp63
VAt that point, what's going to happen?
p64
aVAt that point gravity wins.
p65
aVGravity wins over all other known forces.
p66
aVAnd the object is forced to continue to collapse
p67
aVto an infinitely small object.
p68
aVAnd then it's a black hole.
p69
aVSo, if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube,
p70
aVit would become a black hole,
p71
aVbecause the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is.
p74
aVAnd it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out.
p75
aVIt depends only on the mass of the object.
p76
aVBigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii.
p77
aVSmaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii.
p78
aVSo, if I were to take the sun
p79
aVand compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford,
p80
aVit would become a black hole.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo, now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is.
p83
aVAnd it's actually quite a useful concept,
p84
aVbecause it tells us not only
p85
aVwhen a black hole will form,
p86
aVbut it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole.
p87
aVI only need two things.
p88
aVI need to understand the mass of the object
p89
aVI'm claiming is a black hole,
p90
aVand what its Schwarzschild radius is.
p91
aVAnd since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius,
p92
aVthere is actually only one thing I really need to know.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo, my job in convincing you
p95
aVthat there is a black hole
p96
aVis to show that there is some object
p97
aVthat's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius.
p98
aVAnd your job today is to be skeptical.
p99
aVOkay, so, I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole;
p100
aVI'm going to talk about supermassive black holes.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo, I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is,
p103
aVas if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole.
p104
aVAn ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state
p105
aVof a really massive star's life.
p106
aVSo, if a star starts its life off
p107
aVwith much more mass than the mass of the Sun,
p108
aVit's going to end its life by exploding
p109
aVand leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here.
p110
aVAnd inside that supernova remnant
p111
aVis going to be a little black hole
p112
aVthat has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun.
p113
aVOn an astronomical scale
p114
aVthat's a very small black hole.
p115
aa(lp116
VNow, what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes.
p117
aVAnd the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies.
p118
aVAnd this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope
p119
aVshows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes.
p120
aVThere are big ones. There are little ones.
p121
aVAlmost every object in that picture there is a galaxy.
p122
aVAnd there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left.
p123
aVAnd there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy,
p124
aVjust to give you a sense of scale.
p125
aVAnd all the light that we see from a typical galaxy,
p126
aVwhich is the kind of galaxies that we're seeing here,
p127
aVcomes from the light from the stars.
p128
aVSo, we see the galaxy because of the star light.
p129
aa(lp130
VNow, there are a few relatively exotic galaxies.
p131
aVI like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world,
p132
aVbecause they are kind of show offs.
p133
aVAnd we call them active galactic nuclei.
p134
aVAnd we call them that because their nucleus,
p135
aVor their center, are very active.
p136
aVSo, at the center there, that's actually where
p137
aVmost of the starlight comes out from.
p138
aVAnd yet, what we actually see is light
p139
aVthat can't be explained by the starlight.
p140
aVIt's way more energetic.
p141
aVIn fact, in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here.
p142
aVThere are also jets emanating out from the center.
p143
aVAgain, a source of energy that's very difficult to explain
p144
aVif you just think that galaxies are composed of stars.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo, what people have thought is that perhaps
p147
aVthere are supermassive black holes
p148
aVwhich matter is falling on to.
p149
aVSo, you can't see the black hole itself,
p150
aVbut you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole
p151
aVinto the light we see.
p152
aVSo, there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes
p153
aVexist at the center of galaxies.
p154
aVBut it's a kind of indirect argument.
p155
aa(lp156
VNonetheless, it's given rise to the notion
p157
aVthat maybe it's not just these prima donnas
p158
aVthat have these supermassive black holes,
p159
aVbut rather all galaxies might harbor these
p160
aVsupermassive black holes at their centers.
p161
aVAnd if that's the case \u2014 and this is an example of a normal galaxy;
p162
aVwhat we see is the star light.
p163
aVAnd if there is a supermassive black hole,
p164
aVwhat we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet.
p165
aVBecause that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see
p166
aVin active galactic nuclei.
p167
aa(lp168
VIf we're going to look for these stealth black holes
p169
aVat the center of galaxies,
p170
aVthe best place to look is in our own galaxy, our Milky Way.
p171
aVAnd this is a wide field picture
p172
aVtaken of the center of the Milky Way.
p173
aVAnd what we see is a line of stars.
p174
aVAnd that is because we live in a galaxy which has
p175
aVa flattened, disk-like structure.
p176
aVAnd we live in the middle of it, so when we look towards the center,
p177
aVwe see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy,
p178
aVor line that defines the plane of the galaxy.
p179
aa(lp180
VNow, the advantage of studying our own galaxy
p181
aVis it's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy
p182
aVthat we're ever going to have, because the next closest galaxy
p183
aVis 100 times further away.
p184
aVSo, we can see far more detail in our galaxy
p185
aVthan anyplace else.
p186
aVAnd as you'll see in a moment, the ability to see detail
p187
aVis key to this experiment.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo, how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass
p190
aVinside a small volume?
p191
aVWhich is the job that I have to show you today.
p192
aVAnd the tool that we use is to watch the way
p193
aVstars orbit the black hole.
p194
aVStars will orbit the black hole
p195
aVin the very same way that planets orbit the sun.
p196
aVIt's the gravitational pull
p197
aVthat makes these things orbit.
p198
aVIf there were no massive objects these things would go flying off,
p199
aVor at least go at a much slower rate
p200
aVbecause all that determines how they go around
p201
aVis how much mass is inside its orbit.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo, this is great, because remember my job is to show
p204
aVthere is a lot of mass inside a small volume.
p205
aVSo, if I know how fast it goes around, I know the mass.
p206
aVAnd if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius.
p207
aVSo, I want to see the stars
p208
aVthat are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible.
p209
aVBecause I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible.
p210
aVSo, this means that I want to see a lot of detail.
p211
aVAnd that's the reason that for this experiment we've used
p212
aVthe world's largest telescope.
p213
aa(lp214
VThis is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes
p215
aVwith a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly
p216
aVthe diameter of a tennis court.
p217
aVNow, this is wonderful,
p218
aVbecause the campaign promise
p219
aVof large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope,
p220
aVthe smaller the detail that we can see.
p221
aVBut it turns out these telescopes, or any telescope on the ground
p222
aVhas had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise.
p223
aVAnd that is because of the atmosphere.
p224
aVAtmosphere is great for us; it allows us
p225
aVto survive here on Earth.
p226
aVBut it's relatively challenging for astronomers
p227
aVwho want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo, to give you a sense of what this is like,
p230
aVit's actually like looking at a pebble
p231
aVat the bottom of a stream.
p232
aVLooking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream,
p233
aVthe stream is continuously moving and turbulent,
p234
aVand that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream.
p235
aVVery much in the same way, it's very difficult
p236
aVto see astronomical sources, because of the
p237
aVatmosphere that's continuously moving by.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo, I've spent a lot of my career working on ways
p240
aVto correct for the atmosphere, to give us a cleaner view.
p241
aVAnd that buys us about a factor of 20.
p242
aVAnd I think all of you can agree that if you can
p243
aVfigure out how to improve life by a factor of 20,
p244
aVyou've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot,
p245
aVsay your salary, you'd notice, or your kids, you'd notice.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd this animation here shows you one example of
p248
aVthe techniques that we use, called adaptive optics.
p249
aVYou're seeing an animation that goes between
p250
aVan example of what you would see if you don't use this technique \u2014
p251
aVin other words, just a picture that shows the stars \u2014
p252
aVand the box is centered on the center of the galaxy,
p253
aVwhere we think the black hole is.
p254
aVSo, without this technology you can't see the stars.
p255
aVWith this technology all of a sudden you can see it.
p256
aVThis technology works by introducing a mirror
p257
aVinto the telescope optics system
p258
aVthat's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you.
p259
aVSo, it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope.
p260
aa(lp261
VNow, in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on
p262
aVthat little square there.
p263
aVSo, we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square,
p264
aValthough we've looked at all of them.
p265
aVSo, I want to see how these things have moved.
p266
aVAnd over the course of this experiment, these stars
p267
aVhave moved a tremendous amount.
p268
aVSo, we've been doing this experiment for 15 years,
p269
aVand we see the stars go all the way around.
p270
aa(lp271
VNow, most astronomers have a favorite star,
p272
aVand mine today is a star that's labeled up there, SO-2.
p273
aVAbsolutely my favorite star in the world.
p274
aVAnd that's because it goes around in only 15 years.
p275
aVAnd to give you a sense of how short that is,
p276
aVthe sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy.
p277
aVStars that we knew about before, that were as close to the center of the galaxy
p278
aVas possible, take 500 years.
p279
aVAnd this one, this one goes around in a human lifetime.
p280
aVThat's kind of profound, in a way.
p281
aa(lp282
VBut it's the key to this experiment. The orbit tells me
p283
aVhow much mass is inside a very small radius.
p284
aVSo, next we see a picture here that shows you
p285
aVbefore this experiment the size to which we could
p286
aVconfine the mass of the center of the galaxy.
p287
aVWhat we knew before is that there was four million
p288
aVtimes the mass of the sun inside that circle.
p289
aVAnd as you can see, there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle.
p290
aVYou can see a lot of stars.
p291
aVSo, there was actually lots of alternatives
p292
aVto the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy,
p293
aVbecause you could put a lot of stuff in there.
p294
aa(lp295
VBut with this experiment, we've confined
p296
aVthat same mass to a much smaller volume
p297
aVthat's 10,000 times smaller.
p298
aVAnd because of that, we've been able to show
p299
aVthat there is a supermassive black hole there.
p300
aVTo give you a sense of how small that size is,
p301
aVthat's the size of our solar system.
p302
aVSo, we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun
p303
aVinto that small volume.
p304
aa(lp305
VNow, truth in advertising. Right?
p306
aVI have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius.
p307
aVAnd the truth is, I'm not quite there.
p308
aVBut we actually have no alternative today
p309
aVto explaining this concentration of mass.
p310
aVAnd, in fact, it's the best evidence we have to date
p311
aVfor not only existence of a supermassive black hole
p312
aVat the center of our own galaxy, but any in our universe.
p313
aVSo, what next? I actually think
p314
aVthis is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology,
p315
aVso let's move on with the problem.
p316
aa(lp317
VSo, what I want to tell you, very briefly,
p318
aVis a few examples
p319
aVof the excitement of what we can do today
p320
aVat the center of the galaxy, now that we know that there is,
p321
aVor at least we believe,
p322
aVthat there is a supermassive black hole there.
p323
aVAnd the fun phase of this experiment
p324
aVis, while we've tested some of our ideas
p325
aVabout the consequences of a supermassive black hole
p326
aVbeing at the center of our galaxy,
p327
aValmost every single one
p328
aVhas been inconsistent with what we actually see.
p329
aVAnd that's the fun.
p330
aa(lp331
VSo, let me give you the two examples.
p332
aVYou can ask, "What do you expect
p333
aVfor the old stars, stars that have been around the center of the galaxy
p334
aVfor a long time, they've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole."
p335
aVWhat you expect there is that old stars
p336
aVshould be very clustered around the black hole.
p337
aVYou should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole.
p338
aa(lp339
VLikewise, for the young stars, or in contrast, the young stars,
p340
aVthey just should not be there.
p341
aVA black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery.
p342
aVTo get a star to form, you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse.
p343
aVAnd it's a very fragile entity.
p344
aVAnd what does the big black hole do?
p345
aVIt strips that gas cloud apart.
p346
aVIt pulls much stronger on one side than the other
p347
aVand the cloud is stripped apart.
p348
aVIn fact, we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment.
p349
aa(lp350
VSo, you shouldn't see young stars.
p351
aVSo, what do we see?
p352
aVUsing observations that are not the ones I've shown you today,
p353
aVwe can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young.
p354
aVThe old ones are red.
p355
aVThe young ones are blue. And the yellow ones, we don't know yet.
p356
aVSo, you can already see the surprise.
p357
aVThere is a dearth of old stars.
p358
aVThere is an abundance of young stars, so it's the exact opposite of the prediction.
p359
aa(lp360
VSo, this is the fun part.
p361
aVAnd in fact, today, this is what we're trying to figure out,
p362
aVthis mystery of how do you get \u2014
p363
aVhow do you resolve this contradiction.
p364
aVSo, in fact, my graduate students
p365
aVare, at this very moment, today, at the telescope,
p366
aVin Hawaii, making observations to get us
p367
aVhopefully to the next stage,
p368
aVwhere we can address this question
p369
aVof why are there so many young stars,
p370
aVand so few old stars.
p371
aVTo make further progress we really need to look at the orbits
p372
aVof stars that are much further away.
p373
aVTo do that we'll probably need much more
p374
aVsophisticated technology than we have today.
p375
aa(lp376
VBecause, in truth, while I said we're correcting
p377
aVfor the Earth's atmosphere, we actually only
p378
aVcorrect for half the errors that are introduced.
p379
aVWe do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere,
p380
aVand what we think we can do is if we
p381
aVshine a few more that we can correct the rest.
p382
aVSo this is what we hope to do in the next few years.
p383
aVAnd on a much longer time scale,
p384
aVwhat we hope to do is build even larger telescopes,
p385
aVbecause, remember, bigger is better in astronomy.
p386
aa(lp387
VSo, we want to build a 30 meter telescope.
p388
aVAnd with this telescope we should be able to see
p389
aVstars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy.
p390
aVAnd we hope to be able to test some of
p391
aVEinstein's theories of general relativity,
p392
aVsome ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form.
p393
aVSo, we think the future of this experiment
p394
aVis quite exciting.
p395
aa(lp396
VSo, in conclusion, I'm going to show you an animation
p397
aVthat basically shows you how these
p398
aVorbits have been moving, in three dimensions.
p399
aVAnd I hope, if nothing else,
p400
aVI've convinced you that, one, we do in fact
p401
aVhave a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.
p402
aVAnd this means that these things do exist in our universe,
p403
aVand we have to contend with this, we have to explain
p404
aVhow you can get these objects in our physical world.
p405
aa(lp406
VSecond, we've been able to look at that interaction
p407
aVof how supermassive black holes interact,
p408
aVand understand, maybe, the role in which they play
p409
aVin shaping what galaxies are, and how they work.
p410
aa(lp411
VAnd last but not least,
p412
aVnone of this would have happened
p413
aVwithout the advent of the tremendous progress
p414
aVthat's been made on the technology front.
p415
aVAnd we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast,
p416
aVand holds a lot in store for the future.
p417
aVThanks very much.
