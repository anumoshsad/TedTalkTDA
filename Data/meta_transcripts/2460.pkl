VIn 1962 at Rice University,
p4
aVJFK told the country about a dream he had,
p5
aVa dream to put a person on the moon by the end of the decade.
p6
aVThe eponymous moonshot.
p7
aa(lp8
VNo one knew if it was possible to do
p9
aVbut he made sure a plan was put in place to do it if it was possible.
p10
aVThat's how great dreams are.
p11
aVGreat dreams aren't just visions,
p12
aVthey're visions coupled to strategies for making them real.
p13
aa(lp14
VI have the incredible good fortune to work at a moonshot factory.
p15
aVAt X \u2014 formerly called Google X \u2014
p16
aVyou'll find an aerospace engineer working alongside a fashion designer
p17
aVand former military ops commanders brainstorming with laser experts.
p18
aVThese inventors, engineers and makers are dreaming up technologies
p19
aVthat we hope can make the world a wonderful place.
p20
aa(lp21
VWe use the word "moonshots" to remind us to keep our visions big \u2014
p22
aVto keep dreaming.
p23
aVAnd we use the word "factory" to remind ourselves
p24
aVthat we want to have concrete visions \u2014
p25
aVconcrete plans to make them real.
p26
aa(lp27
VHere's our moonshot blueprint.
p28
aVNumber one:
p29
aVwe want to find a huge problem in the world
p30
aVthat affects many millions of people.
p31
aVNumber two:
p32
aVwe want to find or propose a radical solution for solving that problem.
p33
aVAnd then number three:
p34
aVthere has to be some reason to believe
p35
aVthat the technology for such a radical solution
p36
aVcould actually be built.
p37
aa(lp38
VBut I have a secret for you.
p39
aVThe moonshot factory is a messy place.
p40
aVBut rather than avoid the mess,
p41
aVpretend it's not there,
p42
aVwe've tried to make that our strength.
p43
aVWe spend most of our time breaking things
p44
aVand trying to prove that we're wrong.
p45
aVThat's it, that's the secret.
p46
aVRun at all the hardest parts of the problem first.
p47
aVGet excited and cheer,
p48
aV"Hey! How are we going to kill our project today?"
p49
aa(lp50
VWe've got this interesting balance going
p51
aVwhere we allow our unchecked optimism to fuel our visions.
p52
aVBut then we also harness enthusiastic skepticism
p53
aVto breathe life, breathe reality into those visions.
p54
aa(lp55
VI want to show you a few of the projects
p56
aVthat we've had to leave behind on the cutting room floor,
p57
aVand also a few of the gems
p58
aVthat at least so far, have not only survived that process,
p59
aVbut have been accelerated by it.
p60
aa(lp61
VLast year we killed a project in automated vertical farming.
p62
aVThis is some of the lettuce that we grew.
p63
aVOne in nine people in the world suffers from undernourishment.
p64
aVSo this is a moonshot that needs to happen.
p65
aVVertical farming uses 10 times less water
p66
aVand a hundred times less land than conventional farming.
p67
aVAnd because you can grow the food close to where it's consumed,
p68
aVyou don't have to transport it large distances.
p69
aVWe made progress in a lot of the areas
p70
aVlike automated harvesting and efficient lighting.
p71
aVBut unfortunately,
p72
aVwe couldn't get staple crops like grains and rice to grow this way.
p73
aVSo we killed the project.
p74
aa(lp75
VHere's another huge problem.
p76
aVWe pay enormous costs in resources and environmental damage
p77
aVto ship goods worldwide.
p78
aVEconomic development of landlocked countries
p79
aVis limited by lack of shipping infrastructure.
p80
aVThe radical solution?
p81
aVA lighter-than-air, variable-buoyancy cargo ship.
p82
aVThis has the potential to lower,
p83
aVat least overall,
p84
aVthe cost, time and carbon footprint of shipping
p85
aVwithout needing runways.
p86
aVWe came up with this clever set of technical breakthroughs
p87
aVthat together might make it possible for us to lower the cost enough
p88
aVthat we could actually make these ships \u2014
p89
aVinexpensively enough in volume.
p90
aVBut however cheap they would have been to make in volume
p91
aVit turned out that it was going to cost close to 200 million dollars
p92
aVto design and build the first one.
p93
aa(lp94
V200 million dollars is just way too expensive.
p95
aVBecause X is structured with these tight feedback loops
p96
aVof making mistakes and learning and new designs,
p97
aVwe can't spend 200 million dollars
p98
aVto get the first data point
p99
aVabout whether we're on the right track or not.
p100
aVIf there's an Achilles' heel in one our projects,
p101
aVwe want to know it now, up front, not way down the road.
p102
aVSo we killed this project, too.
p103
aa(lp104
VDiscovering a major flaw in a project
p105
aVdoesn't always mean that it ends the project.
p106
aVSometimes it actually gets us onto a more productive path.
p107
aa(lp108
VThis is our fully self-driving vehicle prototype,
p109
aVwhich we built without a steering wheel or break pedal.
p110
aVBut that wasn't actually our goal when we started.
p111
aa(lp112
VWith 1.2 million people dying on the roads globally every year,
p113
aVbuilding a car that drives itself was a natural moonshot to take.
p114
aVThree and a half years ago,
p115
aVwhen we had these Lexus, retrofitted, self-driving cars in testing,
p116
aVthey were doing so well, we gave them out to other Googlers
p117
aVto find out what they thought of the experience.
p118
aVAnd what we discovered
p119
aVwas that our plan to have the cars do almost all the driving
p120
aVand just hand over to the users in case of emergency
p121
aVwas a really bad plan.
p122
aVIt wasn't safe
p123
aVbecause the users didn't do their job.
p124
aVThey didn't stay alert
p125
aVin case the car needed to hand control back to them.
p126
aa(lp127
VThis was a major crisis for the team.
p128
aVIt sent them back to the drawing board.
p129
aVAnd they came up with a beautiful, new perspective.
p130
aVAim for a car where you're truly a passenger.
p131
aVYou tell the car where you want to go,
p132
aVyou push a button
p133
aVand it takes you from point A to point B by itself.
p134
aa(lp135
VWe're really grateful
p136
aVthat we had this insight as early on in the project as we did.
p137
aVAnd it's shaped everything we've done since then.
p138
aVAnd now our cars have self-driven more than 1.4 million miles,
p139
aVand they're out everyday
p140
aVon the streets of Mountain View, California and Austin, Texas.
p141
aa(lp142
VThe cars team shifted their perspective.
p143
aVThis is one of X's mantras.
p144
aVSometimes shifting your perspective is more powerful than being smart.
p145
aa(lp146
VTake wind energy.
p147
aVIt's one of my favorite examples of perspective shifting.
p148
aVThere's no way that we're going to build
p149
aVa better standard wind turbine than the experts in that industry.
p150
aVBut we found a way to get up higher into the sky,
p151
aVand so get access to faster, more consistent winds,
p152
aVand so more energy without needing hundreds of tons of steel to get there.
p153
aa(lp154
VOur Makani energy kite rises up from its perch
p155
aVby spinning up those propellers along its wing.
p156
aVAnd it pulls out a tether as it rises,
p157
aVpulling energy up through the tether.
p158
aVOnce the tether's all the way out,
p159
aVit goes into crosswind circles in the sky.
p160
aVAnd now those propellers that lifted it up have become flying turbines.
p161
aVAnd that sends energy back down the tether.
p162
aa(lp163
VWe haven't yet found a way to kill this project.
p164
aVAnd the longer it survives that pressure, the more excited we get
p165
aVthat this could become a cheaper and more deployable form
p166
aVof wind energy for the world.
p167
aa(lp168
VProbably the craziest sounding project we have is Project Loon.
p169
aVWe're trying to make balloon-powered Internet.
p170
aVA network of balloons in the stratosphere
p171
aVthat beam an internet connection down to rural and remote areas of the world.
p172
aVThis could bring online as many as four billion more people,
p173
aVwho today have little or no internet connection.
p174
aa(lp175
VBut you can't just take a cell tower,
p176
aVstrap it to a balloon and stick it in the sky.
p177
aVThe winds are too strong, it would be blown away.
p178
aVAnd the balloons are too high up to tie it to the ground.
p179
aa(lp180
VHere comes the crazy moment.
p181
aVWhat if, instead,
p182
aVwe let the balloons drift
p183
aVand we taught them how to sail the winds to go where the needed to go?
p184
aVIt turns out the stratosphere has winds
p185
aVthat are going in quite different speeds and directions in thin strata.
p186
aVSo we hoped that using smart algorithms and wind data from around the world,
p187
aVwe could maneuver the balloons a bit,
p188
aVgetting them to go up and down just a tiny bit in the stratosphere
p189
aVto grab those winds going in those different directions and speeds.
p190
aVThe idea is to have enough balloons
p191
aVso as one balloon floats out of your area,
p192
aVthere's another balloon ready to float into place,
p193
aVhanding off the internet connection,
p194
aVjust like your phone hands off between cell towers
p195
aVas you drive down the freeway.
p196
aa(lp197
VWe get how crazy that vision sounds \u2014
p198
aVthere's the name of the project to remind us of that.
p199
aVSo since 2012,
p200
aVthe Loon team has prioritized the work that seems the most difficult
p201
aVand so the most likely to kill their project.
p202
aa(lp203
VThe first thing that they did
p204
aVwas try to get a Wi-Fi connection from a balloon in the stratosphere
p205
aVdown to an antenna on the ground.
p206
aVIt worked.
p207
aVAnd I promise you there were bets that it wasn't going to.
p208
aVSo we kept going.
p209
aa(lp210
VCould we get the balloon to talk directly to handsets,
p211
aVso that we didn't need the antenna as an intermediary receiver?
p212
aVYeah.
p213
aa(lp214
VCould we get the balloon bandwidth high enough
p215
aVso it was a real Internet connection?
p216
aVSo that people could have something more than just SMS?
p217
aVThe early tests weren't even a megabit per second,
p218
aVbut now we can do up to 15 megabits per second.
p219
aVEnough to watch a TED Talk.
p220
aa(lp221
VCould we get the balloons to talk to each other through the sky
p222
aVso that we could reach our signal deeper into rural areas?
p223
aVCheck.
p224
aa(lp225
VCould we get balloons the size of a house to stay up for more than 100 days,
p226
aVwhile costing less than five percent
p227
aVof what traditional, long-life balloons have cost to make?
p228
aVYes. In the end.
p229
aVBut I promise you, you name it, we had to try it to get there.
p230
aVWe made round, silvery balloons.
p231
aVWe made giant pillow-shaped balloons.
p232
aVWe made balloons the size of a blue whale.
p233
aVWe busted a lot of balloons.
p234
aa(lp235
V(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
VSince one of the things that was most likely to kill the Loon project
p238
aVwas whether we could guide the balloons through the sky,
p239
aVone of our most important experiments was putting a balloon inside a balloon.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo there are two compartments here, one with air and then one with helium.
p242
aVThe balloon pumps air in to make itself heavier,
p243
aVor lets air out to make it lighter.
p244
aVAnd these weight changes allow it to rise or fall,
p245
aVand that simple movement of the balloon is its steering mechanism.
p246
aVIt floats up or down,
p247
aVhoping to grab winds going in the speed and direction that it wants.
p248
aa(lp249
VBut is that good enough for it to navigate through the world?
p250
aVBarely at first,
p251
aVbut better all the time.
p252
aa(lp253
VThis particular balloon, our latest balloon,
p254
aVcan navigate a two-mile vertical stretch of sky
p255
aVand can sail itself to within 500 meters of where it wants to go
p256
aVfrom 20,000 kilometers away.
p257
aa(lp258
VWe have lots more to do
p259
aVin terms of fine-tuning the system and reducing costs.
p260
aVBut last year, a balloon built inexpensively
p261
aVwent around the world 19 times over 187 days.
p262
aVSo we're going to keep going.
p263
aa(lp264
V(Applause)
p265
aa(lp266
VOur balloons today
p267
aVare doing pretty much everything a complete system needs to do.
p268
aVWe're in discussions with telcos around the world,
p269
aVand we're going to fly over places like Indonesia
p270
aVfor real service testing this year.
p271
aa(lp272
VThis probably all sounds too good to be true,
p273
aVand you're right.
p274
aVBeing audacious
p275
aVand working on big, risky things
p276
aVmakes people inherently uncomfortable.
p277
aa(lp278
VYou cannot yell at people and force them to fail fast.
p279
aVPeople resist. They worry.
p280
aV"What will happen to me if I fail?
p281
aVWill people laugh at me?
p282
aVWill I be fired?"
p283
aa(lp284
VI started with our secret.
p285
aVI'm going to leave you with how we actually make it happen.
p286
aVThe only way to get people to work on big, risky things \u2014
p287
aVaudacious ideas \u2014
p288
aVand have them run at all the hardest parts of the problem first,
p289
aVis if you make that the path of least resistance for them.
p290
aa(lp291
VWe work hard at X to make it safe to fail.
p292
aVTeams kill their ideas as soon as the evidence is on the table
p293
aVbecause they're rewarded for it.
p294
aVThey get applause from their peers.
p295
aVHugs and high fives from their manager, me in particular.
p296
aVThey get promoted for it.
p297
aVWe have bonused every single person on teams that ended their projects,
p298
aVfrom teams as small as two to teams of more than 30.
p299
aa(lp300
VWe believe in dreams at the moonshot factory.
p301
aVBut enthusiastic skepticism
p302
aVis not the enemy of boundless optimism.
p303
aVIt's optimism's perfect partner.
p304
aVIt unlocks the potential in every idea.
p305
aVWe can create the future that's in our dreams.
p306
aa(lp307
VThank you very much.
