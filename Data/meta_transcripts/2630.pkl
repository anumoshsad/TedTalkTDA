VRoughly 43,000 years ago,
p6
aVa young cave bear died in the rolling hills
p7
aVon the northwest border of modern day Slovenia.
p8
aVA thousand years later, a mammoth died in southern Germany.
p9
aVA few centuries after that, a griffon vulture also died
p10
aVin the same vicinity.
p11
aVAnd we know almost nothing about how these animals met their deaths,
p12
aVbut these different creatures dispersed across both time and space
p13
aVdid share one remarkable fate.
p14
aVAfter their deaths, a bone from each of their skeletons
p15
aVwas crafted by human hands
p16
aVinto a flute.
p17
aa(lp18
VThink about that for a second.
p19
aVImagine you're a caveman, 40,000 years ago.
p20
aVYou've mastered fire.
p21
aVYou've built simple tools for hunting.
p22
aVYou've learned how to craft garments from animal skins
p23
aVto keep yourself warm in the winter.
p24
aVWhat would you choose to invent next?
p25
aVIt seems preposterous that you would invent the flute,
p26
aVa tool that created useless vibrations in air molecules.
p27
aVBut that is exactly what our ancestors did.
p28
aa(lp29
VNow this turns out to be surprisingly common
p30
aVin the history of innovation.
p31
aVSometimes people invent things
p32
aVbecause they want to stay alive or feed their children
p33
aVor conquer the village next door.
p34
aVBut just as often,
p35
aVnew ideas come into the world
p36
aVsimply because they're fun.
p37
aVAnd here's the really strange thing:
p38
aVmany of those playful but seemingly frivolous inventions
p39
aVended up sparking momentous transformations
p40
aVin science, in politics and society.
p41
aa(lp42
VTake what may be the most important invention of modern times:
p43
aVprogrammable computers.
p44
aVNow, the standard story is that computers descend from military technology,
p45
aVsince many of the early computers were designed specifically
p46
aVto crack wartime codes or calculate rocket trajectories.
p47
aVBut in fact, the origins of the modern computer
p48
aVare much more playful,
p49
aVeven musical,
p50
aVthan you might imagine.
p51
aVThe idea behind the flute,
p52
aVof just pushing air through tubes to make a sound,
p53
aVwas eventually modified to create the first organ
p54
aVmore than 2,000 years ago.
p55
aVSomeone came up with the brilliant idea of triggering sounds
p56
aVby pressing small levers with our fingers,
p57
aVinventing the first musical keyboard.
p58
aVNow, keyboards evolved from organs to clavichords to harpsichords
p59
aVto the piano,
p60
aVuntil the middle of the 19th century,
p61
aVwhen a bunch of inventors finally hit on the idea
p62
aVof using a keyboard to trigger not sounds but letters.
p63
aVIn fact, the very first typewriter
p64
aVwas originally called "the writing harpsichord."
p65
aa(lp66
VFlutes and music led to even more powerful breakthroughs.
p67
aVAbout a thousand years ago,
p68
aVat the height of the Islamic Renaissance,
p69
aVthree brothers in Baghdad designed a device
p70
aVthat was an automated organ.
p71
aVThey called it "the instrument that plays itself."
p72
aVNow, the instrument was basically a giant music box.
p73
aVThe organ could be trained to play various songs by using instructions
p74
aVencoded by placing pins on a rotating cylinder.
p75
aVAnd if you wanted the machine to play a different song,
p76
aVyou just swapped a new cylinder in with a different code on it.
p77
aVThis instrument was the first of its kind.
p78
aVIt was programmable.
p79
aa(lp80
VNow, conceptually, this was a massive leap forward.
p81
aVThe whole idea of hardware and software
p82
aVbecomes thinkable for the first time with this invention.
p83
aVAnd that incredibly powerful concept
p84
aVdidn't come to us as an instrument of war or of conquest,
p85
aVor necessity at all.
p86
aVIt came from the strange delight of watching a machine play music.
p87
aa(lp88
VIn fact, the idea of programmable machines
p89
aVwas exclusively kept alive by music for about 700 years.
p90
aVIn the 1700s, music-making machines
p91
aVbecame the playthings of the Parisian elite.
p92
aVShowmen used the same coded cylinders
p93
aVto control the physical movements of what were called automata,
p94
aVan early kind of robot.
p95
aVOne of the most famous of those robots
p96
aVwas, you guessed it, an automated flute player
p97
aVdesigned by a brilliant French inventor
p98
aVnamed Jacques de Vaucanson.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd as de Vaucanson was designing his robot musician,
p101
aVhe had another idea.
p102
aVIf you could program a machine to make pleasing sounds,
p103
aVwhy not program it to weave delightful patterns of color out of cloth?
p104
aVInstead of using the pins of the cylinder to represent musical notes,
p105
aVthey would represent threads with different colors.
p106
aVIf you wanted a new pattern for your fabric,
p107
aVyou just programmed a new cylinder.
p108
aVThis was the first programmable loom.
p109
aa(lp110
VNow, the cylinders were too expensive and time-consuming to make,
p111
aVbut a half century later,
p112
aVanother French inventor named Jacquard
p113
aVhit upon the brilliant idea of using paper-punched cards
p114
aVinstead of metal cylinders.
p115
aVPaper turned out to be much cheaper and more flexible
p116
aVas a way of programming the device.
p117
aVThat punch card system inspired Victorian inventor Charles Babbage
p118
aVto create his analytical engine,
p119
aVthe first true programmable computer
p120
aVever designed.
p121
aVAnd punch cards were used by computer programmers
p122
aVas late as the 1970s.
p123
aa(lp124
VSo ask yourself this question:
p125
aVwhat really made the modern computer possible?
p126
aVYes, the military involvement is an important part of the story,
p127
aVbut inventing a computer also required other building blocks:
p128
aVmusic boxes,
p129
aVtoy robot flute players,
p130
aVharpsichord keyboards,
p131
aVcolorful patterns woven into fabric,
p132
aVand that's just a small part of the story.
p133
aVThere's a long list of world-changing ideas and technologies
p134
aVthat came out of play:
p135
aVpublic museums, rubber,
p136
aVprobability theory, the insurance business
p137
aVand many more.
p138
aa(lp139
VNecessity isn't always the mother of invention.
p140
aVThe playful state of mind is fundamentally exploratory,
p141
aVseeking out new possibilities in the world around us.
p142
aVAnd that seeking is why so many experiences
p143
aVthat started with simple delight and amusement
p144
aVeventually led us to profound breakthroughs.
p145
aa(lp146
VNow, I think this has implications for how we teach kids in school
p147
aVand how we encourage innovation in our workspaces,
p148
aVbut thinking about play and delight this way
p149
aValso helps us detect what's coming next.
p150
aVThink about it: if you were sitting there in 1750
p151
aVtrying to figure out the big changes coming to society
p152
aVin the 19th, the 20th centuries,
p153
aVautomated machines, computers,
p154
aVartificial intelligence,
p155
aVa programmable flute
p156
aVentertaining the Parisian elite
p157
aVwould have been as powerful a clue as anything else at the time.
p158
aVIt seemed like an amusement at best,
p159
aVnot useful in any serious way,
p160
aVbut it turned out to be the beginning of a tech revolution
p161
aVthat would change the world.
p162
