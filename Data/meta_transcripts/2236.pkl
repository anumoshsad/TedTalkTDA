VHi. I'm going to talk  to you today about laughter,
p4
aVand I just want to start  by thinking about the first time
p5
aVI can ever remember noticing laughter.
p6
aVThis is when I was a little girl. I would've been about six.
p7
aVAnd I came across my parents doing something unusual,
p8
aVwhere they were laughing.
p9
aVThey were laughing very, very hard.
p10
aVThey were lying on the floor laughing.
p11
aVThey were screaming with laughter.
p12
aVI did not know what they were  laughing at, but I wanted in.
p13
aVI wanted to be part of that,
p14
aVand I kind of sat around at the edge going, "Hoo hoo!" (Laughter)
p15
aVNow, incidentally, what they were laughing at
p16
aVwas a song which people used to sing,
p17
aVwhich was based around signs in toilets on trains
p18
aVtelling you what you could and could not do
p19
aVin toilets on trains.
p20
aVAnd the thing you have to remember about the English is, of course,
p21
aVwe do have an immensely sophisticated sense of humor.
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VAt the time, though, I didn't understand anything of that.
p25
aVI just cared about the laughter,
p26
aVand actually, as a neuroscientist, I've come to care about it again.
p27
aVAnd it is a really weird thing to do.
p28
aVWhat I'm going to do now is just play some examples
p29
aVof real human beings laughing,
p30
aVand I want you think about the sound people make and how odd that can be,
p31
aVand in fact how primitive laughter is as a sound.
p32
aVIt's much more like an animal call than it is like speech.
p33
aVSo here we've got some laughter for you. The first one is pretty joyful.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Audio: Laughing)
p36
aa(lp37
VNow this next guy, I need him to breathe.
p38
aVThere's a point in there where I'm just, like,
p39
aVyou've got to get some air in there, mate,
p40
aVbecause he just sounds like he's breathing out.
p41
aa(lp42
V(Audio: Laughing)
p43
aa(lp44
VThis hasn't been edited; this is him.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Audio: Laughing) (Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd finally we have \u2014  this is a human female laughing.
p49
aVAnd laughter can take us to some pretty odd places in terms of making noises.
p50
aV(Audio: Laughing)
p51
aVShe actually says, "Oh my God, what is that?" in French.
p52
aVWe're all kind of with her. I have no idea.
p53
aa(lp54
VNow, to understand laughter, you have to look at a part of the body
p55
aVthat psychologists and neuroscientists don't normally spend much time looking at,
p56
aVwhich is the ribcage,
p57
aVand it doesn't seem terribly exciting,
p58
aVbut actually you're all using  your ribcage all the time.
p59
aVWhat you're all doing  at the moment with your ribcage,
p60
aVand don't stop doing it, is breathing.
p61
aVSo you use the intercostal muscles, the muscles between your ribs,
p62
aVto bring air in and out of your lungs
p63
aVjust by expanding and contracting your ribcage,
p64
aVand if I was to put a strap  around the outside of your chest
p65
aVcalled a breath belt, and just look  at that movement,
p66
aVyou see a rather gentle sinusoidal movement, so that's breathing.
p67
aVYou're all doing it. Don't stop.
p68
aVAs soon as you start talking,
p69
aVyou start using your breathing completely differently.
p70
aVSo what I'm doing now is you see something much more like this.
p71
aVIn talking, you use very fine movements of the ribcage
p72
aVto squeeze the air out \u2014
p73
aVand in fact, we're the only animals that can do this.
p74
aVIt's why we can talk at all.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow, both talking and breathing has a mortal enemy,
p77
aVand that enemy is laughter,
p78
aVbecause what happens when you laugh
p79
aVis those same muscles start to contract very regularly,
p80
aVand you get this very marked sort of zig-zagging,
p81
aVand that's just squeezing the air out of you.
p82
aVIt literally is that basic a way of making a sound.
p83
aVYou could be stamping on somebody, it's having the same effect.
p84
aVYou're just squeezing air out,
p85
aVand each of those contractions \u2014 Ha! \u2014 gives you a sound.
p86
aVAnd as the contractions run together, you can get these spasms,
p87
aVand that's when you start getting these \u2014 (Wheezing) \u2014 things happening.
p88
aVI'm brilliant at this. (Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VNow, in terms of the science of laughter, there isn't very much,
p91
aVbut it does turn out that pretty much everything we think we know
p92
aVabout laughter is wrong.
p93
aVSo it's not at all unusual, for example, to hear people to say
p94
aVhumans are the only animals that laugh.
p95
aVNietzsche thought that humans are the only animals that laugh.
p96
aVIn fact, you find laughter throughout the mammals.
p97
aVIt's been well-described and well-observed in primates,
p98
aVbut you also see it in rats,
p99
aVand wherever you find it \u2014
p100
aVhumans, primates, rats \u2014
p101
aVyou find it associated with things like tickling.
p102
aVThat's the same for humans.
p103
aVYou find it associated with play, and all mammals play.
p104
aVAnd wherever you find it, it's associated with interactions.
p105
aVSo Robert Provine, who has done a lot of work on this,
p106
aVhas pointed out that you are 30 times  more likely to laugh
p107
aVif you are with somebody else than if you're on your own,
p108
aVand where you find most laughter
p109
aVis in social interactions like conversation.
p110
aVSo if you ask human beings, "When do you laugh?"
p111
aVthey'll talk about comedy and they'll talk about humor and they'll talk about jokes.
p112
aVIf you look at when they laugh, they're laughing with their friends.
p113
aVAnd when we laugh with people, we're hardly ever actually laughing at jokes.
p114
aVYou are laughing to show people that you understand them,
p115
aVthat you agree with them, that you're part of the same group as them.
p116
aVYou're laughing to show that you like them.
p117
aVYou might even love them.
p118
aVYou're doing all that at the same time as talking to them,
p119
aVand the laughter is doing a lot of that emotional work for you.
p120
aVSomething that Robert Provine has pointed out, as you can see here,
p121
aVand the reason why we were laughing
p122
aVwhen we heard those funny laughs at the start,
p123
aVand why I was laughing when I found my parents laughing,
p124
aVis that it's an enormously behaviorally contagious effect.
p125
aVYou can catch laughter from somebody else,
p126
aVand you are more likely to catch laughter off somebody else if you know them.
p127
aVSo it's still modulated by this social context.
p128
aVYou have to put humor to one side
p129
aVand think about the social  meaning of laughter
p130
aVbecause that's where its origins lie.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, something I've got very interested in is different kinds of laughter,
p133
aVand we have some neurobiological evidence about how human beings vocalize
p134
aVthat suggests there might be two kinds of laughs that we have.
p135
aVSo it seems possible that the neurobiology for helpless, involuntary laughter,
p136
aVlike my parents lying on the floor screaming about a silly song,
p137
aVmight have a different basis to it than some of that more polite
p138
aVsocial laughter that you encounter, which isn't horrible laughter,
p139
aVbut it's behavior somebody is doing as part of their communicative act to you,
p140
aVpart of their interaction with you; they are choosing to do this.
p141
aVIn our evolution, we have developed two different ways of vocalizing.
p142
aVInvoluntary vocalizations are part of an older system
p143
aVthan the more voluntary vocalizations like the speech I'm doing now.
p144
aVSo we might imagine that laughter might actually have two different roots.
p145
aa(lp146
VSo I've been looking at this in more detail.
p147
aVTo do this, we've had to make recordings of people laughing,
p148
aVand we've had to do whatever it takes to make people laugh,
p149
aVand we got those same people to produce more posed, social laughter.
p150
aVSo imagine your friend told a joke,
p151
aVand you're laughing because you like your friend,
p152
aVbut not really because the joke's all that.
p153
aVSo I'm going to play you  a couple of those.
p154
aVI want you to tell me if you think this laughter is real laughter,
p155
aVor if you think it's posed.
p156
aVSo is this involuntary laughter or more voluntary laughter?
p157
aa(lp158
V(Audio: Laughing)
p159
aa(lp160
VWhat does that sound like to you?
p161
aVAudience: Posed. Sophie Scott: Posed? Posed.
p162
aVHow about this one?
p163
aa(lp164
V(Audio: Laughing)
p165
aa(lp166
V(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VI'm the best.
p169
aa(lp170
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p171
aa(lp172
VNot really.
p173
aVNo, that was helpless laughter,
p174
aVand in fact, to record that, all they had to do was record me
p175
aVwatching one of my friends listening to something I knew she wanted to laugh at,
p176
aVand I just started doing this.
p177
aa(lp178
VWhat you find is that people are good at telling the difference
p179
aVbetween real and posed laughter.
p180
aVThey seem to be different things to us.
p181
aVInterestingly, you see something quite similar with chimpanzees.
p182
aVChimpanzees laugh differently if they're being tickled
p183
aVthan if they're playing with each other,
p184
aVand we might be seeing something like that here,
p185
aVinvoluntary laughter, tickling laughter, being different from social laughter.
p186
aVThey're acoustically very different.
p187
aVThe real laughs are longer. They're higher in pitch.
p188
aVWhen you start laughing hard,
p189
aVyou start squeezing air out from your lungs
p190
aVunder much higher pressures than you could ever produce voluntarily.
p191
aVFor example, I could never pitch my voice that high to sing.
p192
aVAlso, you start to get these sort of contractions and weird whistling sounds,
p193
aVall of which mean that real laughter is extremely easy,
p194
aVor feels extremely easy to spot.
p195
aa(lp196
VIn contrast, posed laughter, we might think it sounds a bit fake.
p197
aVActually, it's not, it's actually an important social cue.
p198
aVWe use it a lot, we're choosing to laugh in a lot of situations,
p199
aVand it seems to be its own thing.
p200
aVSo, for example, you find nasality in posed laughter,
p201
aVthat kind of "ha ha ha ha ha" sound
p202
aVthat you never get, you could not do, if you were laughing involuntarily.
p203
aVSo they do seem to be genuinely these two different sorts of things.
p204
aa(lp205
VWe took it into the scanner to see how brains respond
p206
aVwhen you hear laughter.
p207
aVAnd when you do this, this is a really boring experiment.
p208
aVWe just played people real and posed laughs.
p209
aVWe didn't tell them it was a study on laughter.
p210
aVWe put other sounds in there  to distract them,
p211
aVand all they're doing is lying listening to sounds.
p212
aVWe don't tell them to do anything.
p213
aVNonetheless, when you hear real laughter and when you hear posed laughter,
p214
aVthe brains are responding completely differently,
p215
aVsignificantly differently.
p216
aVWhat you see in the regions in blue, which lies in auditory cortex,
p217
aVare the brain areas that respond more to the real laughs,
p218
aVand what seems to be the case,
p219
aVwhen you hear somebody laughing involuntarily,
p220
aVyou hear sounds you would never hear in any other context.
p221
aVIt's very unambiguous,
p222
aVand it seems to be associated with greater auditory processing
p223
aVof these novel sounds.
p224
aVIn contrast, when you hear somebody laughing in a posed way,
p225
aVwhat you see are these regions in pink,
p226
aVwhich are occupying brain areas associated with mentalizing,
p227
aVthinking about what somebody else is thinking.
p228
aVAnd I think what that means is,
p229
aVeven if you're having your brain scanned, which is completely boring
p230
aVand not very interesting,
p231
aVwhen you hear somebody going, "A ha ha ha ha ha,"
p232
aVyou're trying to work out why they're laughing.
p233
aVLaughter is always meaningful.
p234
aVYou are always trying to understand it in context,
p235
aVeven if, as far as you are concerned, at that point in time,
p236
aVit has not necessarily anything to do with you,
p237
aVyou still want to know why those people are laughing.
p238
aa(lp239
VNow, we've had the opportunity to look  at how people hear real and posed laughter
p240
aVacross the age range.
p241
aVSo this is an online experiment we ran with the Royal Society,
p242
aVand here we just asked people two questions.
p243
aVFirst of all, they heard some laughs,
p244
aVand they had to say, how real  or posed do these laughs sound?
p245
aVThe real laughs are shown in red and the posed laughs are shown in blue.
p246
aVWhat you see is there is a rapid onset.
p247
aVAs you get older, you get better and better at spotting real laughter.
p248
aVSo six-year-olds are at chance, they can't really hear the difference.
p249
aVBy the time you are older, you get better,
p250
aVbut interestingly, you do not hit peak performance in this dataset
p251
aVuntil you are in your late 30s and early 40s.
p252
aVYou don't understand laughter fully by the time you hit puberty.
p253
aVYou don't understand laughter fully by the time your brain has matured
p254
aVat the end of your teens.
p255
aVYou're learning about laughter throughout your entire early adult life.
p256
aa(lp257
VIf we turn the question around and now say not, what does the laughter sound like
p258
aVin terms of being real or posed, but we say,
p259
aVhow much does this laughter make you want to laugh,
p260
aVhow contagious is this laughter to you, we see a different profile.
p261
aVAnd here, the younger you are,
p262
aVthe more you want to join in when you hear laughter.
p263
aVRemember me laughing with my parents when I had no idea what was going on.
p264
aVYou really can see this.
p265
aVNow everybody, young and old,
p266
aVfinds the real laughs more contagious than the posed laughs,
p267
aVbut as you get older, it all becomes  less contagious to you.
p268
aVNow, either we're all just becoming really grumpy as we get older,
p269
aVor it may mean that as you understand laughter better,
p270
aVand you are getting better at doing that,
p271
aVyou need more than just hearing people laugh to want to laugh.
p272
aVYou need the social stuff there.
p273
aa(lp274
VSo we've got a very interesting behavior
p275
aVabout which a lot of our lay assumptions are incorrect,
p276
aVbut I'm coming to see that actually there's even more to laughter
p277
aVthan it's an important social emotion we should look at,
p278
aVbecause it turns out people are phenomenally nuanced
p279
aVin terms of how we use laughter.
p280
aVThere's a really lovely set of studies coming out
p281
aVfrom Robert Levenson's lab in California,
p282
aVwhere he's doing a longitudinal study with couples.
p283
aVHe gets married couples, men and women, into the lab,
p284
aVand he gives them stressful conversations to have
p285
aVwhile he wires them up to a polygraph so he can see them becoming stressed.
p286
aVSo you've got the two of them in there, and he'll say to the husband,
p287
aV"Tell me something that your wife does that irritates you."
p288
aVAnd what you see is immediately \u2014
p289
aVjust run that one through your head briefly, you and your partner \u2014
p290
aVyou can imagine everybody gets a bit more stressed as soon as that starts.
p291
aVYou can see physically, people become more stressed.
p292
aVWhat he finds is that the couples who manage that feeling of stress
p293
aVwith laughter, positive emotions like laughter,
p294
aVnot only immediately become less stressed,
p295
aVthey can see them physically feeling better,
p296
aVthey're dealing with this unpleasant situation better together,
p297
aVthey are also the couples that report
p298
aVhigh levels of satisfaction in their relationship
p299
aVand they stay together for longer.
p300
aVSo in fact, when you look at close relationships,
p301
aVlaughter is a phenomenally useful index
p302
aVof how people are regulating their emotions together.
p303
aVWe're not just emitting it at each other to show that we like each other,
p304
aVwe're making ourselves feel better together.
p305
aa(lp306
VNow, I don't think this is going to be limited to romantic relationships.
p307
aVI think this is probably going to be a characteristic
p308
aVof close emotional relationships such as you might have with friends,
p309
aVwhich explains my next clip,
p310
aVwhich is of a YouTube video of some young men in the former East Germany
p311
aVon making a video to promote their heavy metal band,
p312
aVand it's extremely macho, and the mood is very serious,
p313
aVand I want you to notice what happens in terms of laughter
p314
aVwhen things go wrong
p315
aVand how quickly that happens, and how that changes the mood.
p316
aa(lp317
VHe's cold. He's about to get wet. He's got swimming trunks on,
p318
aVgot a towel.
p319
aVIce.
p320
aVWhat might possibly happen?
p321
aVVideo starts.
p322
aVSerious mood.
p323
aVAnd his friends are already laughing. They are already laughing, hard.
p324
aVHe's not laughing yet.
p325
aV(Laughter)
p326
aVHe's starting to go now.
p327
aVAnd now they're all off.
p328
aV(Laughter)
p329
aVThey're on the floor.
p330
aV(Laughter)
p331
aa(lp332
VThe thing I really like about that is it's all very serious
p333
aVuntil he jumps onto the ice, and as soon as he doesn't go through the ice,
p334
aVbut also there isn't blood and bone everywhere,
p335
aVhis friends start laughing.
p336
aVAnd imagine if that had played him out with him standing there going,
p337
aV"No seriously, Heinrich, I think this is broken,"
p338
aVwe wouldn't enjoy watching that. That would be stressful.
p339
aVOr if he was running around with a visibly broken leg laughing,
p340
aVand his friends are going, "Heinrich, I think we need to go to the hospital now,"
p341
aVthat also wouldn't be funny.
p342
aVThe fact that the laughter works,
p343
aVit gets him from a painful, embarrassing, difficult situation,
p344
aVinto a funny situation, into what we're  actually enjoying there,
p345
aVand I think that's  a really interesting use,
p346
aVand it's actually happening all the time.
p347
aa(lp348
VFor example, I can remember something like this happening
p349
aVat my father's funeral.
p350
aVWe weren't jumping around on the ice in our underpants.
p351
aVWe're not Canadian.
p352
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p353
aVThese events are always difficult, I had a relative who was being a bit difficult,
p354
aVmy mum was not in a good place,
p355
aVand I can remember finding myself just before the whole thing started
p356
aVtelling this story about something that happened in a 1970s sitcom,
p357
aVand I just thought at the time, I don't know why I'm doing this,
p358
aVand what I realized I was doing
p359
aVwas I was coming up with something from somewhere
p360
aVI could use to make her laugh together with me.
p361
aVIt was a very basic reaction to find some reason we can do this.
p362
aVWe can laugh together. We're going to get through this.
p363
aVWe're going to be okay.
p364
aa(lp365
VAnd in fact, all of us are doing this all the time.
p366
aVYou do it so often, you don't even notice it.
p367
aVEverybody underestimates how often they laugh,
p368
aVand you're doing something, when you laugh with people,
p369
aVthat's actually letting you access a really ancient evolutionary system
p370
aVthat mammals have evolved to make and maintain social bonds,
p371
aVand clearly to regulate emotions, to make ourselves feel better.
p372
aVIt's not something specific to humans \u2014 it's a really ancient behavior
p373
aVwhich really helps us regulate how we feel and makes us feel better.
p374
aa(lp375
VIn other words, when it comes to laughter,
p376
aVyou and me, baby, ain't nothing  but mammals. (Laughter)
p377
aa(lp378
VThank you.
p379
aa(lp380
