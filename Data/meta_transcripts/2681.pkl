VThe last time I heard my son's voice
p4
aVwas when he walked out the front door
p5
aVon his way to school.
p6
aVHe called out one word in the darkness:
p7
aV"Bye."
p8
aa(lp9
VIt was April 20, 1999.
p10
aVLater that morning, at Columbine High School,
p11
aVmy son Dylan and his friend Eric
p12
aVkilled 12 students and a teacher
p13
aVand wounded more than 20 others before taking their own lives.
p14
aVThirteen innocent people were killed,
p15
aVleaving their loved ones in a state of grief and trauma.
p16
aVOthers sustained injuries,
p17
aVsome resulting in disfigurement and permanent disability.
p18
aVBut the enormity of the tragedy
p19
aVcan't be measured only by the number of deaths and injuries that took place.
p20
aVThere's no way to quantify the psychological damage
p21
aVof those who were in the school,
p22
aVor who took part in rescue or cleanup efforts.
p23
aVThere's no way to assess the magnitude of a tragedy like Columbine,
p24
aVespecially when it can be a blueprint
p25
aVfor other shooters who go on to commit atrocities of their own.
p26
aVColumbine was a tidal wave,
p27
aVand when the crash ended,
p28
aVit would take years for the community and for society
p29
aVto comprehend its impact.
p30
aa(lp31
VIt has taken me years to try to accept my son's legacy.
p32
aVThe cruel behavior that defined the end of his life
p33
aVshowed me that he was a completely different person from the one I knew.
p34
aVAfterwards people asked,
p35
aV"How could you not know?
p36
aVWhat kind of a mother were you?"
p37
aVI still ask myself those same questions.
p38
aa(lp39
VBefore the shootings, I thought of myself as a good mom.
p40
aVHelping my children become caring,
p41
aVhealthy, responsible adults
p42
aVwas the most important role of my life.
p43
aVBut the tragedy convinced me that I failed as a parent,
p44
aVand it's partially this sense of failure that brings me here today.
p45
aVAside from his father,
p46
aVI was the one person who knew and loved Dylan the most.
p47
aVIf anyone could have known what was happening,
p48
aVit should have been me, right?
p49
aVBut I didn't know.
p50
aa(lp51
VToday, I'm here to share the experience
p52
aVof what it's like to be the mother of someone who kills and hurts.
p53
aVFor years after the tragedy, I combed through memories,
p54
aVtrying to figure out exactly where I failed as a parent.
p55
aVBut there are no simple answers.
p56
aVI can't give you any solutions.
p57
aVAll I can do
p58
aVis share what I have learned.
p59
aa(lp60
VWhen I talk to people who didn't know me before the shootings,
p61
aVI have three challenges to meet.
p62
aVFirst, when I walk into a room like this,
p63
aVI never know if someone there has experienced loss
p64
aVbecause of what my son did.
p65
aVI feel a need to acknowledge the suffering caused by a member of my family
p66
aVwho isn't here to do it for himself.
p67
aVSo first, with all of my heart,
p68
aVI'm sorry if my son has caused you pain.
p69
aa(lp70
VThe second challenge I have
p71
aVis that I must ask for understanding and even compassion
p72
aVwhen I talk about my son's death as a suicide.
p73
aVTwo years before he died,
p74
aVhe wrote on a piece of paper in a notebook
p75
aVthat he was cutting himself.
p76
aVHe said that he was in agony
p77
aVand wanted to get a gun so he could end his life.
p78
aVI didn't know about any of this until months after his death.
p79
aVWhen I talk about his death as a suicide,
p80
aVI'm not trying to downplay the viciousness he showed at the end of his life.
p81
aVI'm trying to understand
p82
aVhow his suicidal thinking
p83
aVled to murder.
p84
aVAfter a lot of reading and talking with experts,
p85
aVI have come to believe
p86
aVthat his involvement in the shootings was rooted not in his desire to kill
p87
aVbut in his desire to die.
p88
aa(lp89
VThe third challenge I have when I talk about my son's murder-suicide
p90
aVis that I'm talking about mental health \u2014
p91
aVexcuse me \u2014
p92
aVis that I'm talking about mental health,
p93
aVor brain health, as I prefer to call it, because it's more concrete.
p94
aVAnd in the same breath, I'm talking about violence.
p95
aVThe last thing I want to do is to contribute to the misunderstanding
p96
aVthat already exists around mental illness.
p97
aVOnly a very small percent of those who have a mental illness
p98
aVare violent toward other people,
p99
aVbut of those who die by suicide,
p100
aVit's estimated that about 75 to maybe more than 90 percent
p101
aVhave a diagnosable mental health condition of some kind.
p102
aVAs you all know very well,
p103
aVour mental health care system is not equipped to help everyone,
p104
aVand not everyone with destructive thoughts
p105
aVfits the criteria
p106
aVfor a specific diagnosis.
p107
aVMany who have ongoing feelings
p108
aVof fear or anger or hopelessness
p109
aVare never assessed or treated.
p110
aVToo often, they get our attention only if they reach a behavioral crisis.
p111
aVIf estimates are correct
p112
aVthat about one to two percent of all suicides
p113
aVinvolves the murder of another person,
p114
aVwhen suicide rates rise, as they are rising for some populations,
p115
aVthe murder-suicide rates will rise as well.
p116
aa(lp117
VI wanted to understand what was going on in Dylan's mind prior to his death,
p118
aVso I looked for answers from other survivors of suicide loss.
p119
aVI did research and volunteered to help with fund-raising events,
p120
aVand whenever I could,
p121
aVI talked with those who had survived their own suicidal crisis
p122
aVor attempt.
p123
aa(lp124
VOne of the most helpful conversations I had
p125
aVwas with a coworker
p126
aVwho overheard me talking to someone else
p127
aVin my office cubicle.
p128
aVShe heard me say that Dylan could not have loved me
p129
aVif he could do something as horrible as he did.
p130
aVLater, when she found me alone,
p131
aVshe apologized for overhearing that conversation,
p132
aVbut told me that I was wrong.
p133
aVShe said that when she was a young, single mother
p134
aVwith three small children,
p135
aVshe became severely depressed and was hospitalized to keep her safe.
p136
aVAt the time, she was certain
p137
aVthat her children would be better off if she died,
p138
aVso she had made a plan to end her life.
p139
aVShe assured me that a mother's love was the strongest bond on Earth,
p140
aVand that she loved her children more than anything in the world,
p141
aVbut because of her illness,
p142
aVshe was sure that they would be better off without her.
p143
aa(lp144
VWhat she said and what I've learned from others
p145
aVis that we do not make the so-called decision or choice
p146
aVto die by suicide
p147
aVin the same way that we choose what car to drive
p148
aVor where to go on a Saturday night.
p149
aVWhen someone is in an extremely suicidal state,
p150
aVthey are in a stage four medical health emergency.
p151
aVTheir thinking is impaired and they've lost access to tools of self-governance.
p152
aVEven though they can make a plan and act with logic,
p153
aVtheir sense of truth is distorted by a filter of pain
p154
aVthrough which they interpret their reality.
p155
aVSome people can be very good at hiding this state,
p156
aVand they often have good reasons for doing that.
p157
aVMany of us have suicidal thoughts at some point,
p158
aVbut persistent, ongoing thoughts of suicide
p159
aVand devising a means to die
p160
aVare symptoms of pathology,
p161
aVand like many illnesses,
p162
aVthe condition has to be recognized and treated
p163
aVbefore a life is lost.
p164
aa(lp165
VBut my son's death was not purely a suicide.
p166
aVIt involved mass murder.
p167
aVI wanted to know how his suicidal thinking became homicidal.
p168
aVBut research is sparse and there are no simple answers.
p169
aVYes, he probably had ongoing depression.
p170
aVHe had a personality that was perfectionistic and self-reliant,
p171
aVand that made him less likely to seek help from others.
p172
aVHe had experienced triggering events at the school
p173
aVthat left him feeling debased and humiliated and mad.
p174
aVAnd he had a complicated friendship
p175
aVwith a boy who shared his feelings of rage and alienation,
p176
aVand who was seriously disturbed,
p177
aVcontrolling and homicidal.
p178
aVAnd on top of this period in his life
p179
aVof extreme vulnerability and fragility,
p180
aVDylan found access to guns
p181
aVeven though we'd never owned any in our home.
p182
aVIt was appallingly easy for a 17-year-old boy to buy guns,
p183
aVboth legally and illegally, without my permission or knowledge.
p184
aVAnd somehow, 17 years and many school shootings later,
p185
aVit's still appallingly easy.
p186
aa(lp187
VWhat Dylan did that day broke my heart,
p188
aVand as trauma so often does,
p189
aVit took a toll on my body and on my mind.
p190
aVTwo years after the shootings, I got breast cancer,
p191
aVand two years after that, I began to have mental health problems.
p192
aVOn top of the constant, perpetual grief
p193
aVI was terrified that I would run into a family member
p194
aVof someone Dylan had killed,
p195
aVor be accosted by the press
p196
aVor by an angry citizen.
p197
aVI was afraid to turn on the news,
p198
aVafraid to hear myself being called a terrible parent or a disgusting person.
p199
aa(lp200
VI started having panic attacks.
p201
aVThe first bout started four years after the shootings,
p202
aVwhen I was getting ready for the depositions
p203
aVand would have to meet the victims' families face to face.
p204
aVThe second round started six years after the shootings,
p205
aVwhen I was preparing to speak publicly about murder-suicide
p206
aVfor the first time at a conference.
p207
aVBoth episodes lasted several weeks.
p208
aVThe attacks happened everywhere:
p209
aVin the hardware store, in my office,
p210
aVor even while reading a book in bed.
p211
aVMy mind would suddenly lock into this spinning cycle of terror
p212
aVand no matter how I hard I tried
p213
aVto calm myself down or reason my way out of it,
p214
aVI couldn't do it.
p215
aVIt felt as if my brain was trying to kill me,
p216
aVand then, being afraid of being afraid
p217
aVconsumed all of my thoughts.
p218
aVThat's when I learned firsthand
p219
aVwhat it feels like to have a malfunctioning mind,
p220
aVand that's when I truly became a brain health advocate.
p221
aVWith therapy and medication and self-care,
p222
aVlife eventually returned
p223
aVto whatever could be thought of as normal under the circumstances.
p224
aa(lp225
VWhen I looked back on all that had happened,
p226
aVI could see that my son's spiral into dysfunction
p227
aVprobably occurred over a period of about two years,
p228
aVplenty of time to get him help,
p229
aVif only someone had known that he needed help
p230
aVand known what to do.
p231
aa(lp232
VEvery time someone asks me,
p233
aV"How could you not have known?",
p234
aVit feels like a punch in the gut.
p235
aVIt carries accusation and taps into my feelings of guilt
p236
aVthat no matter how much therapy I've had
p237
aVI will never fully eradicate.
p238
aVBut here's something I've learned:
p239
aVif love were enough
p240
aVto stop someone who is suicidal
p241
aVfrom hurting themselves,
p242
aVsuicides would hardly ever happen.
p243
aVBut love is not enough,
p244
aVand suicide is prevalent.
p245
aVIt's the second leading cause of death
p246
aVfor people age 10 to 34,
p247
aVand 15 percent of American youth
p248
aVreport having made a suicide plan
p249
aVin the last year.
p250
aVI've learned that no matter how much we want to believe we can,
p251
aVwe cannot know or control
p252
aVeverything our loved ones think and feel,
p253
aVand the stubborn belief that we are somehow different,
p254
aVthat someone we love would never think of hurting themselves
p255
aVor someone else,
p256
aVcan cause us to miss
p257
aVwhat's hidden in plain sight.
p258
aVAnd if worst case scenarios do come to pass,
p259
aVwe'll have to learn to forgive ourselves for not knowing
p260
aVor for not asking the right questions
p261
aVor not finding the right treatment.
p262
aVWe should always assume
p263
aVthat someone we love may be suffering,
p264
aVregardless of what they say
p265
aVor how they act.
p266
aVWe should listen with our whole being,
p267
aVwithout judgments,
p268
aVand without offering solutions.
p269
aa(lp270
VI know that I will live with this tragedy,
p271
aVwith these multiple tragedies,
p272
aVfor the rest of my life.
p273
aVI know that in the minds of many,
p274
aVwhat I lost can't compare to what the other families lost.
p275
aVI know my struggle doesn't make theirs any easier.
p276
aVI know there are even some who think I don't have the right to any pain,
p277
aVbut only to a life of permanent penance.
p278
aa(lp279
VIn the end what I know comes down to this:
p280
aVthe tragic fact is that even the most vigilant and responsible of us
p281
aVmay not be able to help,
p282
aVbut for love's sake,
p283
aVwe must never stop trying
p284
aVto know the unknowable.
p285
aa(lp286
VThank you.
