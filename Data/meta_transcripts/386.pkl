VThis is very strange for me, because I\u2019m not used to doing this:
p4
aVI usually stand on the other side of the light,
p5
aVand now I'm feeling the pressure I put other people into. And it's hard ...
p6
aVThe previous speaker has, I think,
p7
aVreally painted a very good background as to
p8
aVthe impulse behind my work and what drives me, and my sense of loss,
p9
aVand trying to find the answer to the big questions.
p10
aa(lp11
VBut this, for me, I mean, coming here to do this,
p12
aVfeels like \u2014 there\u2019s this sculptor that I like very much, Giacometti,
p13
aVwho after many years of living in France \u2014 and learning, you know,
p14
aVstudying and working \u2014 he returned home and he was asked, what did you produce?
p15
aVWhat have you done with so many years of being away?
p16
aVAnd he sort of, he showed a handful of figurines.
p17
aVAnd obviously they were, "Is this what you spent years doing?
p18
aVAnd we expected huge masterpieces!"
p19
aVBut what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces
p20
aVwas the culmination of a man\u2019s life, search, thought, everything \u2014
p21
aVjust in a reduced, small version.
p22
aVIn a way, I feel like that.
p23
aVI feel like I\u2019m coming home to talk about
p24
aVwhat I\u2019ve been away doing for 20 years.
p25
aVAnd I will start with a brief taster of what I\u2019ve been about:
p26
aVa handful of films \u2014 nothing much,
p27
aVtwo feature films and a handful of short films.
p28
aVSo, we\u2019ll go with the first piece.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Video) Woman: "I destroy lives," mum said.
p31
aVI love her, you know.
p32
aVShe\u2019s not even my real mum.
p33
aVMy real mum and dad dumped me
p34
aVand fucked off back to Nigeria.
p35
aVThe devil is in me, Court.
p36
aVCourt: Sleep.
p37
aVWoman: Have you ever been?
p38
aVCourt: Where?
p39
aVWoman: Nigeria.
p40
aVCourt: Never.
p41
aVMy mum wanted to,
p42
aVcouldn\u2019t afford it.
p43
aVWoman: Wish I could.
p44
aVI have this feeling I\u2019d be happy there.
p45
aVWhy does everyone get rid of me?
p46
aVCourt: I don't want to get rid of you.
p47
aVWoman: You don't need me.
p48
aVYou\u2019re just too blind to see it now.
p49
aa(lp50
VBoy: What do you do all day?
p51
aVMarcus: Read.
p52
aVBoy: Don't you get bored?
p53
aVAnd how come you ain't got a job anyway?
p54
aVMarcus: I am retired.
p55
aVBoy: So?
p56
aVMarcus: So I've done my bit for Queen and country, now I work for myself.
p57
aVBoy: No, now you sit around like a bum all day.
p58
aVMarcus: Because I do what I like?
p59
aVBoy: Look man, reading don't feed no one.
p60
aVAnd it particularly don't feed your spliff habit.
p61
aVMarcus: It feeds my mind and my soul.
p62
aVBoy: Arguing with you is a waste of time, Marcus.
p63
aVMarcus: You\u2019re a rapper, am I right?
p64
aVBoy: Yeah.
p65
aVMarcus: A modern day poet.
p66
aVBoy: Yeah, you could say that.
p67
aVMarcus: So what do you talk about?
p68
aVBoy: What's that supposed to mean?
p69
aVMarcus: Simple. What do you rap about?
p70
aVBoy: Reality, man.
p71
aVMarcus: Whose reality?
p72
aVBoy: My fuckin' reality.
p73
aVMarcus: Tell me about your reality.
p74
aVBoy: Racism, oppression, people like me not getting a break in life.
p75
aVMarcus: So what solutions do you offer? I mean, the job of a poet is not just \u2014
p76
aVBoy: Man, fight the power! Simple: blow the motherfuckers out of the sky.
p77
aVMarcus: With an AK-47?
p78
aVBoy: Man, if I had one, too fuckin' right.
p79
aVMarcus: And how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you?
p80
aVBoy: Oh, Marcus, you know what I mean.
p81
aVMarcus: When a man resorts to profanities,
p82
aVit\u2019s a sure sign of his inability to express himself.
p83
aVBoy: See man, you\u2019re just taking the piss out of me now.
p84
aVMarcus: The Panthers.
p85
aVBoy: Panthers?
p86
aVAss kickin' guys who were fed up with all that white supremacist, powers-that-be bullshit,
p87
aVand just went in there and kicked everybody's arse.
p88
aVFuckin\u2019 wicked, man. I saw the movie. Bad! What?
p89
aa(lp90
VDirector 1: I saw his last film.
p91
aVÉpuise, right?
p92
aVWoman 1: Yes.
p93
aVD1: Not to make a bad joke, but it was really épuisé.
p94
aVEpuisé \u2014 tired, exhausted, fed up.
p95
aVDirector 2: Can you not shut up?
p96
aVNow, you talk straight to me, what\u2019s wrong with my films?
p97
aVLet\u2019s go.
p98
aVW1: They suck.
p99
aVWoman 2: They suck? What about yours?
p100
aVWhat, what, what, what about, what?
p101
aVWhat do you think about your movie?
p102
aVD1: My movies, they are OK, fine.
p103
aVThey are better than making documentaries no one ever sees.
p104
aVWhat the fuck are you talking about?
p105
aVDid you ever move your fuckin' ass from Hollywood
p106
aVto go and film something real?
p107
aVYou make people fuckin' sleep.
p108
aVDream about bullshit.

VNewton Aduaka: Thank you. The first clip, really, is
p113
aVtotally trying to capture what cinema is for me,
p114
aVand where I'm coming from in terms of cinema.
p115
aVThe first piece was, really, there's a young woman talking about Nigeria,
p116
aVthat she has a feeling she'll be happy there.
p117
aVThese are the sentiments of someone that's been away from home.
p118
aVAnd that was something that I went through, you know, and I'm still going through.
p119
aVI've not been home for quite a while, for about five years now.
p120
aVI've been away 20 years in total.
p121
aVAnd so it\u2019s really \u2014
p122
aVit's really how suddenly, you know, this was made in 1997,
p123
aVwhich is the time of Abacha \u2014 the military dictatorship,
p124
aVthe worst part of Nigerian history, this post-colonial history.
p125
aVSo, for this girl to have these dreams
p126
aVis simply how we preserve a sense of what home is.
p127
aVHow \u2014 and it's sort of, perhaps romantic, but I think beautiful,
p128
aVbecause you just need something to hold on to,
p129
aVespecially in a society where you feel alienated.
p130
aa(lp131
VWhich takes us to the next piece, where the young man
p132
aVtalks about lack of opportunity: living as a black person in Europe,
p133
aVthe glass ceiling that we all know about, that we all talk about,
p134
aVand his reality.
p135
aVAgain, this was my \u2014 this was me talking about \u2014
p136
aVthis was, again, the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom,
p137
aVand there was this buzzword \u2014 and it was trying to say,
p138
aVwhat exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people?
p139
aVAnd what would a child \u2014
p140
aVwhat does a child like Jamie \u2014 the young boy \u2014 think,
p141
aVI mean, with all this anger that's built up inside of him?
p142
aVWhat happens with that?
p143
aVWhat, of course, happens with that is violence,
p144
aVwhich we see when we talk about the ghettos
p145
aVand we talk about, you know, South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff,
p146
aVand which eventually, when channeled, becomes,
p147
aVyou know, evolves and manifests itself as riots \u2014
p148
aVlike the one in France two years ago, where I live,
p149
aVwhich shocked everybody, because everyone thought, "Oh well,
p150
aVFrance is a liberal society."
p151
aVBut I lived in England for 18 years.
p152
aVI've lived in France for about four, and I feel actually
p153
aVthrown back 20 years, living in France.
p154
aVAnd then, the third piece. The third piece for me is the question:
p155
aVWhat is cinema to you? What do you do with cinema?
p156
aVThere's a young director, Hollywood director, with his friends \u2014
p157
aVfellow filmmakers \u2014 talking about what cinema means.
p158
aVI suppose that will take me to my last piece \u2014
p159
aVwhat cinema means for me.
p160
aVMy life started as a \u2014 I started life in 1966,
p161
aVa few months before the Biafran, which lasted for three years
p162
aVand it was three years of war.
p163
aVSo that whole thing,
p164
aVthat whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece.
p165
aa(lp166
V(Video) Voice: Onicha, off to school with your brother.
p167
aVOnicha: Yes, mama.
p168
aVCommander: Soldiers, you are going to fight a battle,
p169
aVso you must get ready and willing to die.
p170
aVYou must get \u2014 ?
p171
aVChild Soldiers: Ready and willing to die.
p172
aVC: Success, the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun.
p173
aVCS: The barrel of the gun!
p174
aVC: This is the gun.
p175
aVCS: This is the gun.
p176
aVC: This is an AK-47 rifle. This is your life.
p177
aVThis is your life. This is ... this is ... this is your life.
p178
aVEzra: They give us the special drugs. We call it bubbles.
p179
aVAmphetamines.
p180
aVSoldiers: Rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.
p181
aVI say rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.
p182
aVWe went from one village to another \u2014 three villages.
p183
aVI don\u2019t remember how we got there.
p184
aVWitness: We walked and walked for two days.
p185
aVWe didn't eat.
p186
aVThere was no food, just little rice.
p187
aVWithout food \u2014 I was sick.
p188
aVThe injection made us not to have mind.
p189
aVGod will forgive us.

VCommittee Chairman: We hope that, with your help and the help of others, that this commission
p232
aVwill go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war.
p233
aVMore than that, begin a healing process and finally to \u2014
p234
aVas an act of closure to a terrible period in this country\u2019s history.
p235
aVThe beginning of hope.
p236
aVMr. Ezra Gelehun, please stand.
p237
aVState your name and age for the commission.
p238
aVEzra: My name is Ezra Gelehun.
p239
aVI am 15 or 16. I don\u2019t remember.
p240
aVAsk my sister, she is the witch, she knows everything.
p241
aV(Sister: 16.)
p242
aVCC: Mr. Gelehun, I\u2019d like to remind you you\u2019re not on trial here
p243
aVfor any crimes you committed.
p244
aVE: We were fighting for our freedom.
p245
aVIf killing in a war is a crime,
p246
aVthen you have to charge every soldier in the world.
p247
aVWar is a crime, yes, but I did not start it.
p248
aVYou too are a retired General, not so?
p249
aVCC: Yes, correct.
p250
aVE: So you too must stand trial then.
p251
aVOur government was corrupt.
p252
aVLack of education was their way to control power.
p253
aVIf I may ask, do you pay for school in your country?
p254
aVCC: No, we don\u2019t.
p255
aVE: You are richer than us.
p256
aVBut we pay for school.
p257
aVYour country talks about democracy,
p258
aVbut you support corrupt governments like my own.
p259
aVWhy? Because you want our diamond.
p260
aVAsk if anyone in this room have ever seen real diamond before?
p261
aVNo.
p262
aVCC: Mr. Gelehun, I'd like to remind you, you're not on trial here today.
p263
aVYou are not on trial.
p264
aVE: Then let me go.
p265
aVCC: I can't do that, son.
p266
aVE: So you are a liar.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Applause)
p269
aa(lp270
VNA: Thank you. Just very quickly to say that my point really here,
p271
aVis that while we\u2019re making all these huge advancements,
p272
aVwhat we're doing, which for me, you know, I think we should \u2014
p273
aVAfrica should move forward, but we should remember,
p274
aVso we do not go back here again.
p275
aVThank you.
p276
aa(lp277
VEmeka Okafor: Thank you, Newton.
p278
aa(lp279
V(Applause)
p280
aa(lp281
VOne of the themes that comes through very strongly
p282
aVin the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young
p283
aVthat have to play this role of being child soldiers.
p284
aVAnd considering where you are coming from,
p285
aVand when we consider the extent to which it\u2019s not taken as seriously
p286
aVas it should be, what would you have to say about that?
p287
aa(lp288
VNA: In the process of my research, I actually spent
p289
aVa bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this.
p290
aVAnd I remember I met a lot of child soldiers \u2014
p291
aVex-combatants, as they like to be called.
p292
aVI met psychosocial workers who worked with them.
p293
aVI met psychiatrists who spent time with them,
p294
aVaid workers, NGOs, the whole lot.
p295
aVBut I remember on the flight back on my last trip,
p296
aVI remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself,
p297
aVif any kid in the West, in the western world,
p298
aVwent through a day of what any of those kids have gone through,
p299
aVthey will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives.
p300
aVSo for me, the thought that we have all these children \u2014
p301
aVit\u2019s a generation, we have a whole generation of children \u2014
p302
aVwho have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage,
p303
aVand Africa has to live with that.
p304
aVBut I\u2019m just saying to factor that in,
p305
aVfactor that in with all this great advancement,
p306
aVall this pronouncement of great achievement.
p307
aVThat\u2019s really my thinking.
p308
aa(lp309
VEO: Well, we thank you again for coming to the TED stage.
