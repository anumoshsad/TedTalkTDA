VLet's talk trash.
p4
aa(lp5
VYou know, we had to be taught
p6
aVto renounce the powerful conservation ethic
p7
aVwe developed during the Great Depression and World War II.
p8
aVAfter the war, we needed to direct our enormous production capacity
p9
aVtoward creation of products for peacetime.
p10
aVLife Magazine helped in this effort
p11
aVby announcing the introduction of throwaways
p12
aVthat would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes.
p13
aa(lp14
VMental note to the liberators:
p15
aVthrowaway plastics take a lot of space and don't biodegrade.
p16
aVOnly we humans make waste that nature can't digest.
p17
aa(lp18
VPlastics are also hard to recycle.
p19
aVA teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent
p20
aVof plastics recovered in our waste stream.
p21
aVIt's diddly-point-squat.
p22
aVThat's the percentage we recycle.
p23
aa(lp24
VNow, melting point has a lot to do with this.
p25
aVPlastic is not purified by the re-melting process like glass and metal.
p26
aVIt begins to melt below the boiling point of water
p27
aVand does not drive off the oily contaminants
p28
aVfor which it is a sponge.
p29
aVHalf of each year's 100 billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets
p30
aVwill be made into fast-track trash.
p31
aVA large, unruly fraction of our trash
p32
aVwill flow downriver to the sea.
p33
aa(lp34
VHere is the accumulation at Biona Creek next to the L.A. airport.
p35
aVAnd here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beach
p36
aVand the diesel plant we visited yesterday.
p37
aa(lp38
VIn spite of deposit fees,
p39
aVmuch of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles.
p40
aVWe use two million of them in the United States every five minutes,
p41
aVhere imaged by TED presenter Chris Jordan,
p42
aVwho artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail.
p43
aa(lp44
VHere is a remote island repository for bottles
p45
aVoff the coast of Baja California.
p46
aVIsla San Roque is an uninhabited bird rookery
p47
aVoff Baja's sparsely populated central coast.
p48
aVNotice that the bottles here have caps on them.
p49
aVBottles made of polyethylene terephthalate, PET,
p50
aVwill sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization.
p51
aVAlso, the caps are produced in separate factories
p52
aVfrom a different plastic, polypropylene.
p53
aVThey will float in seawater,
p54
aVbut unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills.
p55
aa(lp56
VLet's trace the journey of the millions of caps
p57
aVthat make it to sea solo.
p58
aVAfter a year the ones from Japan are heading straight across the Pacific,
p59
aVwhile ours get caught in the California current
p60
aVand first head down to the latitude of Cabo San Lucas.
p61
aVAfter ten years, a lot of the Japanese caps
p62
aVare in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch,
p63
aVwhile ours litter the Philippines.
p64
aVAfter 20 years, we see emerging the debris accumulation zone
p65
aVof the North Pacific Gyre.
p66
aa(lp67
VIt so happens that millions of albatross
p68
aVnesting on Kure and Midway atolls
p69
aVin the Northwest Hawaiian Islands National Monument
p70
aVforage here and scavenge whatever they can find
p71
aVfor regurgitation to their chicks.
p72
aVA four-month old Laysan Albatross chick
p73
aVdied with this in its stomach.
p74
aVHundreds of thousands of the goose-sized chicks are dying
p75
aVwith stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish,
p76
aVlike cigarette lighters ...
p77
aVbut, mostly bottle caps.
p78
aVSadly, their parents mistake bottle caps for food
p79
aVtossing about in the ocean surface.
p80
aa(lp81
VThe retainer rings for the caps
p82
aValso have consequences for aquatic animals.
p83
aVThis is Mae West,
p84
aVstill alive at a zookeeper's home in New Orleans.
p85
aa(lp86
VI wanted to see what my home town of Long Beach was contributing to the problem,
p87
aVso on Coastal Clean-Up Day in 2005
p88
aVI went to the Long Beach Peninsula, at the east end of our long beach.
p89
aVWe cleaned up the swaths of beach shown.
p90
aVI offered five cents each for bottle caps.
p91
aVI got plenty of takers.
p92
aVHere are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected.
p93
aVI thought I would spend 20 bucks.
p94
aVThat day I ended up spending nearly 60.
p95
aa(lp96
VI separated them by color
p97
aVand put them on display the next Earth Day
p98
aVat Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro.
p99
aVGovernor Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria stopped by to discuss the display.
p100
aVIn spite of my "girly man" hat, crocheted from plastic shopping bags,
p101
aVthey shook my hand. (Laughter)
p102
aVI showed him and Maria a zooplankton trawl
p103
aVfrom the gyre north of Hawaii
p104
aVwith more plastic than plankton.
p105
aa(lp106
VHere's what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like.
p107
aVTrawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile
p108
aVproduces samples like this.
p109
aVAnd this.
p110
aVNow, when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaii
p111
aVit looks like this.
p112
aVAnd this particular beach is Kailua Beach,
p113
aVthe beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow, how do we analyze samples like this one
p116
aVthat contain more plastic than plankton?
p117
aVWe sort the plastic fragments into different size classes,
p118
aVfrom five millimeters to one-third of a millimeter.
p119
aVSmall bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants
p120
aVup to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater.
p121
aa(lp122
VWe wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean,
p123
aVat the base of the food chain,
p124
aVwas ingesting these poison pills.
p125
aVWe did hundreds of necropsies,
p126
aVand over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs.
p127
aVThe record-holder, only two-and-a-half inches long,
p128
aVhad 84 pieces in its tiny stomach.
p129
aa(lp130
VNow, you can buy certified organic produce.
p131
aVBut no fishmonger on Earth
p132
aVcan sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish.
p133
aa(lp134
VThis is the legacy we are leaving to future generations.
p135
aVThe throwaway society cannot be contained \u2014
p136
aVit has gone global.
p137
aVWe simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff.
p138
aVWe have to throw it away.
p139
aVNow, the market can do a lot for us,
p140
aVbut it can't fix the natural system in the ocean we've broken.
p141
aVAll the king's horses and all the king's men ...
p142
aVwill never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again.
p143
aa(lp144
VNarrator (Video): The levels are increasing,
p145
aVthe amount of packaging is increasing,
p146
aVthe "throwaway" concept of living is proliferating,
p147
aVand it's showing up in the ocean.
p148
aa(lp149
VAnchor: He offers no hope of cleaning it up.
p150
aVStraining the ocean for plastic
p151
aVwould be beyond the budget of any country
p152
aVand it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process.
p153
aVThe solution, Moore says, is to stop the plastic at its source:
p154
aVstop it on land before it falls in the ocean.
p155
aVAnd in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world,
p156
aVhe doesn't hold out much hope for that, either.
p157
aVThis is Brian Rooney for Nightline,
p158
aVin Long Beach, California.
