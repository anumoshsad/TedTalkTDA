VI'm a writer and a journalist,
p4
aVand I'm also an insanely curious person,
p5
aVso in 22 years as a journalist,
p6
aVI've learned how to do a lot of new things.
p7
aVAnd three years ago, one of the things I learned how to do
p8
aVwas to become invisible.
p9
aVI became one of the working homeless.
p10
aVI quit my job as a newspaper editor
p11
aVafter my father died in February of that same year,
p12
aVand decided to travel.
p13
aVHis death hit me pretty hard.
p14
aVAnd there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that.
p15
aa(lp16
VI've camped my whole life. And I decided
p17
aVthat living in a van for a year to do this
p18
aVwould be like one long camping trip.
p19
aVSo I packed my cat, my Rottweiler
p20
aVand my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van,
p21
aVand drove off into the sunset,
p22
aVhaving fully failed to realize three critical things.
p23
aVOne: that society equates
p24
aVliving in a permanent structure, even a shack,
p25
aVwith having value as a person.
p26
aVTwo: I failed to realize how quickly
p27
aVthe negative perceptions of other people
p28
aVcan impact our reality, if we let it.
p29
aVThree: I failed to realize
p30
aVthat homelessness is an attitude,
p31
aVnot a lifestyle.
p32
aa(lp33
VAt first, living in the van was great.
p34
aVI showered in campgrounds. I ate out regularly.
p35
aVAnd I had time to relax and to grieve.
p36
aVBut then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in.
p37
aVMy freelance job ended. And I had to get a full-time job
p38
aVto pay the bills.
p39
aVWhat had been a really mild spring
p40
aVturned into a miserably hot summer.
p41
aVAnd it became impossible to park anywhere \u2014
p42
aV(Laughs)
p43
aV\u2014 without being very obvious
p44
aVthat I had a cat and a dog with me, and it was really hot.
p45
aVThe cat came and went through an open window in the van.
p46
aVThe doggy went into doggy day care.
p47
aVAnd I sweated.
p48
aVWhenever I could, I used
p49
aVemployee showers in office buildings and truck stops.
p50
aVOr I washed up in public rest rooms.
p51
aa(lp52
VNighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahrenheit,
p53
aVmaking it difficult or impossible to sleep.
p54
aVFood rotted in the heat.
p55
aVIce in my ice chest melted within hours,
p56
aVand it was pretty miserable.
p57
aVI couldn't afford to find an apartment,
p58
aVor couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me
p59
aVto have the Rottweiler and the cat.
p60
aVAnd I refused to give them up,
p61
aVso I stayed in the van.
p62
aVAnd when the heat made me too sick
p63
aVto walk the 50 feet to the public restroom
p64
aVoutside my van at night,
p65
aVI used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet.
p66
aa(lp67
VWhen winter weather set in, the temperatures dropped
p68
aVbelow freezing. And they stayed there.
p69
aVAnd I faced a whole new set of challenges.
p70
aVI parked a different place every night
p71
aVso I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police.
p72
aVI didn't always succeed.
p73
aa(lp74
VBut I felt out of control of my life.
p75
aVAnd I don't know when or how it happened,
p76
aVbut the speed at which I went
p77
aVfrom being a talented writer and journalist
p78
aVto being a homeless woman, living in a van,
p79
aVtook my breath away.
p80
aVI hadn't changed. My I.Q. hadn't dropped.
p81
aVMy talent, my integrity, my values,
p82
aVeverything about me remained the same.
p83
aVBut I had changed somehow.
p84
aVI spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic.
p87
aVAnd I went. I hadn't bathed in three days.
p88
aVI was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line.
p89
aVI just wasn't drunk or high.
p90
aVAnd when several of the homeless men realized that,
p91
aVincluding a former university professor,
p92
aVthey said, "You aren't homeless. Why are you really here?"
p93
aVOther homeless people didn't see me as homeless,
p94
aVbut I did.
p95
aVThen the professor listened to my story and he said,
p96
aV"You have a job. You have hope.
p97
aVThe real homeless don't have hope."
p98
aVA reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression
p99
aVleft me suicidal. And I remember thinking,
p100
aV"If I killed myself, no one would notice."
p101
aa(lp102
VA friend told me, shortly after that,
p103
aVthat she had heard that Tim Russert,
p104
aVa nationally renowned journalist,
p105
aVhad been talking about me on national T.V.
p106
aVAn essay I'd written about my father,
p107
aVthe year before he died, was in Tim's new book.
p108
aVAnd he was doing the talk show circuit. And he was talking about my writing.
p109
aVAnd when I realized that Tim Russert, former moderator of "Meet the Press,"
p110
aVwas talking about my writing,
p111
aVwhile I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot,
p112
aVI started laughing.
p113
aVYou should too.
p114
aV(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VI started laughing
p117
aVbecause it got to the point where,
p118
aVwas I a writer, or was I a homeless woman?
p119
aVSo I went in the bookstore. And I found Tim's book.
p120
aVAnd I stood there. And I reread my essay.
p121
aVAnd I cried.
p122
aVBecause I was a writer.
p123
aVI was a writer.
p124
aVShortly after that I moved back to Tennessee.
p125
aVI alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends.
p126
aVAnd I started writing again.
p127
aVBy the summer of the following year I was a working journalist.
p128
aVI was winning awards. I was living in my own apartment.
p129
aVI was no longer homeless.
p130
aVAnd I was no longer invisible.
p131
aa(lp132
VThousands of people work full and part-time jobs,
p133
aVand live in their cars.
p134
aVBut society continues to stigmatize and criminalize
p135
aVliving in your vehicle or on the streets.
p136
aVSo the homeless, the working homeless, primarily remain invisible.
p137
aVBut if you ever meet one,
p138
aVengage them, encourage them, and offer them hope.
p139
aVThe human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope.
p140
aVAnd I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless.
p141
aVI'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet.
p142
aVBut I am here to tell you that, based on my experience,
p143
aVpeople are not where they live,
p144
aVwhere they sleep,
p145
aVor what their life situation is at any given time.
p146
aVThree years ago I was living in a van
p147
aVin a Wal-Mart parking lot,
p148
aVand today I'm speaking at TED.
p149
aVHope always, always finds a way. Thank you.
