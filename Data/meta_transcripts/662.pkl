VOne of the biggest challenges in computer graphics
p4
aVhas been being able to create a photo-real,
p5
aVdigital human face.
p6
aVAnd one of the reasons it is so difficult is that, unlike aliens and dinosaurs,
p7
aVwe look at human faces every day.
p8
aVThey are very important to how we communicate with each other.
p9
aVAs a result, we're tuned in to the subtlest things
p10
aVthat could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering,
p11
aVin order to believe whether these things are realistic.
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd what I'm going to do in the next five minutes
p14
aVis take you through a process
p15
aVwhere we tried to create a reasonably photo-realistic computer-generated face,
p16
aVusing some computer graphics technology we've developed,
p17
aVand also some collaborators at a company called Image Metrics.
p18
aVAnd we're going to try to do a photo-real face
p19
aVof an actress named Emily O'Brien, who is right there.
p20
aVAnd that's actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face.
p21
aVBy the end of the talk, we're going to see it move.
p22
aa(lp23
VThe way that we did this is we tried to start with Emily herself,
p24
aVwho was gracious enough to come to our laboratory
p25
aVin Marina Del Rey, and sit for a session in Light Stage 5.
p26
aVThis is a face-scanning sphere, with 156 white LEDs all around
p27
aVthat allow us to photograph her
p28
aVin a series of very controlled illumination conditions.
p29
aVAnd the lighting that we use these days looks something like this.
p30
aVWe shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd we basically capture enough information
p33
aVwith video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face,
p34
aVand different principle directions of light from the light stage,
p35
aVto figure out both the coarse-scale
p36
aVand the fine-scale detail of her face.
p37
aVIf we zoom in on this photograph right here,
p38
aVwe can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her,
p39
aVbecause she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time
p40
aVto get a nice image of her facial texture.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd in addition, we've actually used polarizers on all the lights \u2014
p43
aVjust like polarized sunglasses can block
p44
aVthe glare off of the road,
p45
aVpolarizers can block the shine off of the skin,
p46
aVso we don't get all those specular reflections to take this map.
p47
aVNow, if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit,
p48
aVwe can actually bring that specular reflection
p49
aVof the skin back in,
p50
aVand you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point.
p51
aVIf you take the difference between these two images here,
p52
aVyou can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light
p53
aVof just the shine off of Emily's skin.
p54
aa(lp55
VI don't think any photograph like this had ever been taken
p56
aVbefore we had done this.
p57
aVAnd this is very important light to capture,
p58
aVbecause this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin.
p59
aVIt doesn't get underneath the translucent
p60
aVlayers of the skin and blur out.
p61
aVAnd, as a result, it's a very good cue
p62
aVto the detailed shape of the skin-pore structure
p63
aVand all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have,
p64
aVthe things that actually make us look like real humans.
p65
aa(lp66
VSo, if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection,
p67
aVwe can go from a traditional face scan
p68
aVthat might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape,
p69
aVand augment it with information
p70
aVthat puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles.
p71
aVAnd, even more importantly,
p72
aVsince this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture,
p73
aVwe can shoot Emily
p74
aVin just part of an afternoon,
p75
aVin many different facial poses and facial expressions.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo, here you can see her moving her eyes around, moving her mouth around.
p78
aVAnd these we're actually going to use to create a photo-real digital character.
p79
aVIf you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily,
p80
aVyou can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things
p81
aVas it goes into different facial expressions.
p82
aVYou can see things. Not only the face shape changes,
p83
aVbut all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs.
p84
aVYou can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously
p85
aVfrom stretched skin pores
p86
aVto the regular skin texture.
p87
aVYou can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there.
p88
aVYou can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down.
p89
aVHer muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that.
p90
aa(lp91
VIn addition to this kind of high-resolution geometry,
p92
aVsince it's all captured with cameras, we've got a great texture map to use for the face.
p93
aVAnd by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination,
p94
aVthe red and the green and the blue,
p95
aVdiffuse the light differently,
p96
aVwe can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer.
p97
aVThen, instead of looking like a plaster mannequin,
p98
aVit actually looks like it's made out of living human flesh.
p99
aa(lp100
VAnd this is what we used
p101
aVto give to the company Image Metrics
p102
aVto create a rigged, digital version of Emily.
p103
aVWe're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here.
p104
aVBut they basically created a digital puppet of her,
p105
aVwhere you can pull on these various strings,
p106
aVand it actually moves her face in ways that are
p107
aVcompletely consistent with the scans that we took.
p108
aVAnd, in addition to the coarse-scale geometry,
p109
aVthey also used all of that detail
p110
aVto create a set of what are called "displacement maps"
p111
aVthat animate as well.
p112
aVThese are the displacement maps here.
p113
aVAnd you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo the next process was then to animate her.
p116
aVWe actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data.
p117
aVSo, by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques,
p118
aVthey were able to drive the facial rig
p119
aVwith the computer-generated performance.
p120
aVSo what you're going to see now, after this,
p121
aVis a completely photo-real digital face.
p122
aVWe can turn the volume up a little bit if that's available.
p123
aa(lp124
VEmily: Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company.
p125
aVWe specialize in high-quality facial animation
p126
aVfor video games and films.

aa(lp131
VPaul Debevec: So, if we break that down into layers, here's that diffuse component
p132
aVwe saw in the first slide.
p133
aVHere is the specular component animating.
p134
aVYou can see all the wrinkles happening there.
p135
aVAnd there is the underlying wireframe mesh.
p136
aVAnd that is Emily herself.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow, where are we going with this here?
p139
aVWe've gone a little bit beyond Light Stage 5. This is Light Stage 6,
p140
aVand we're looking at taking this technology
p141
aVand applying it to whole human bodies.
p142
aVThis is Bruce Lawmen, one of our researchers in the group,
p143
aVwho graciously agreed to get captured running in the Light Stage.
p144
aVAnd let's take a look at a computer-generated version
p145
aVof Bruce, running in a new environment.
p146
aVAnd thank you very much.
