VThis sound,
p4
aVthis smell,
p5
aVthis sight
p6
aVall remind me of the campfires of my childhood,
p7
aVwhen anyone could become a storyteller in front of the dancing flames.
p8
aVThere was this wondrous ending
p9
aVwhen people and fire fell asleep almost in unison.
p10
aVIt was dreaming time.
p11
aa(lp12
VNow my story has a lot to do with dreaming,
p13
aValthough I'm known to make my dreams come true.
p14
aVLast year, I created a one-man show.
p15
aVFor an hour and a half I shared with the audience
p16
aVa lifetime of creativity,
p17
aVhow I pursue perfection, how I cheat the impossible.
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd then TED challenged me:
p20
aV"Philippe, can you shrink this lifetime to 18 minutes?"
p21
aV(Laughter)
p22
aVEighteen minutes, clearly impossible.
p23
aVBut here I am.
p24
aVOne solution was to rehearse a machine gun delivery
p25
aVin which every syllable, every second will have its importance
p26
aVand hope to God the audience will be able to follow me.
p27
aVNo, no, no.
p28
aVNo, the best way for me to start
p29
aVis to pay my respects to the gods of creativity.
p30
aVSo please join me for a minute of silence.
p31
aa(lp32
VOkay, I cheated, it was a mere 20 seconds.
p33
aVBut hey, we're on TED time.
p34
aa(lp35
VWhen I was six years old,
p36
aVI fell in love with magic.
p37
aVFor Christmas I got a magic box
p38
aVand a very old book on card manipulation.
p39
aVSomehow I was more interested in pure manipulation
p40
aVthan in all the silly little tricks in the box.
p41
aVSo I looked in the book for the most difficult move,
p42
aVand it was this.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow I'm not supposed to share that with you,
p45
aVbut I have to show you the card is hidden in the back of the hand.
p46
aVNow that manipulation
p47
aVwas broken down into seven moves
p48
aVdescribed over seven pages.
p49
aVOne, two, three,
p50
aVfour, five, six and seven.
p51
aVAnd let me show you something else.
p52
aVThe cards were bigger than my hands.
p53
aa(lp54
VTwo months later, six years old,
p55
aVI'm able to do one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
p56
aVAnd I go to see a famous magician
p57
aVand proudly ask him, "Well what do you think?"
p58
aVSix years old.
p59
aVThe magician looked at me and said, "This is a disaster.
p60
aVYou cannot do that in two seconds
p61
aVand have a minuscule part of the card showing.
p62
aVFor the move to be professional, it has to be less than one second
p63
aVand it has to be perfect."
p64
aVTwo years later, one \u2014 zoop.
p65
aVAnd I'm not cheating. It's in the back. It's perfect.
p66
aa(lp67
VPassion is the motto
p68
aVof all my actions.
p69
aVAs I'm studying magic,
p70
aVjuggling is mentioned repeatedly
p71
aVas a great way to acquire dexterity and coordination.
p72
aVNow I had long admired how fast and fluidly
p73
aVjugglers make objects fly.
p74
aVSo that's it. I'm 14; I'm becoming a juggler.
p75
aa(lp76
VI befriend a young juggler in a juggling troupe,
p77
aVand he agrees to sell me three clubs.
p78
aVBut in America you have to explain. What are clubs?
p79
aVNothing to do with golf.
p80
aVThey are those beautiful oblong objects,
p81
aVbut quite difficult to make.
p82
aVThey have to be precisely lathed.
p83
aVOh, when I was buying the clubs,
p84
aVsomehow the young juggler was hiding from the others.
p85
aVWell I didn't think much of it at the time.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnyway, here I was progressing with my new clubs.
p88
aVBut I could not understand.
p89
aVI was pretty fast, but I was not fluid at all.
p90
aVThe clubs were escaping me at each throw.
p91
aVAnd I was trying constantly to bring them back to me.
p92
aVUntil one day I practiced in front of Francis Brunn,
p93
aVthe world's greatest juggler.
p94
aVAnd he was frowning.
p95
aVAnd he finally asked, "Can I see those?"
p96
aVSo I proudly showed him my clubs.
p97
aVHe said, "Philippe, you have been had.
p98
aVThese are rejects. They are completely out of alignment.
p99
aVThey are impossible to juggle."
p100
aVTenacity is how I kept at it
p101
aVagainst all odds.
p102
aa(lp103
VSo I went to the circus to see more magicians, more jugglers,
p104
aVand I saw \u2014 oh no, no, no, I didn't see.
p105
aVIt was more interesting; I heard.
p106
aVI heard about those amazing men and women
p107
aVwho walk on thin air \u2014
p108
aVthe high-wire walkers.
p109
aVNow I have been playing with ropes and climbing all my childhood,
p110
aVso that's it. I'm 16; I'm becoming a wire walker.
p111
aa(lp112
VI found two trees \u2014
p113
aVbut not any kind of trees,
p114
aVtrees with character \u2014
p115
aVand then a very long rope.
p116
aVAnd I put the rope around and around
p117
aVand around and around and around till I had no more rope.
p118
aVNow I have all of those ropes parallel like this.
p119
aVI get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers,
p120
aVand I gather them together in some kind of ropey path.
p121
aVSo I just created the widest tightrope in the world.
p122
aVWhat did I need? I needed the widest shoes in the world.
p123
aVSo I found some enormous, ridiculous, giant ski boots
p124
aVand then wobbly, wobbly I get on the ropes.
p125
aa(lp126
VWell within a few days I'm able to do one crossing.
p127
aVSo I cut one rope off.
p128
aVAnd the next day one rope off.
p129
aVAnd a few days later, I was practicing on a single tightrope.
p130
aVNow you can imagine at that time
p131
aVI had to switch the ridiculous boots for some slippers.
p132
aVSo that is how \u2014 in case there are people here in the audience who would like to try \u2014
p133
aVthis is how not to learn wire walking.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VIntuition is a tool essential in my life.
p138
aVIn the meantime, I am being thrown out of five different schools
p139
aVbecause instead of listening to the teachers,
p140
aVI am my own teacher, progressing in my new art
p141
aVand becoming a street juggler.
p142
aa(lp143
VOn the high wire, within months,
p144
aVI'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus,
p145
aVexcept I am not satisfied.
p146
aa(lp147
VI was starting to invent my own moves and bring them to perfection.
p148
aVBut nobody wanted to hire me.
p149
aVSo I started putting a wire up in secret and performing without permission.
p150
aVNotre Dame,
p151
aVthe Sydney Harbor Bridge,
p152
aVthe World Trade Center.
p153
aVAnd I developed a certitude, a faith
p154
aVthat convinced me that I will get safely to the other side.
p155
aVIf not, I will never do that first step.
p156
aa(lp157
VWell nonetheless,
p158
aVon the top of the World Trade Center
p159
aVmy first step was terrifying.
p160
aVAll of a sudden the density of the air is no longer the same.
p161
aVManhattan no longer spreads its infinity.
p162
aVThe murmur of the city dissolves into a squall
p163
aVwhose chilling power I no longer feel.
p164
aVI lift the balancing pole. I approach the edge.
p165
aVI step over the beam.
p166
aVI put my left foot on the cable,
p167
aVthe weight of my body raised on my right leg
p168
aVanchored to the flank of the building.
p169
aVShall I ever so slightly shift my weight to the left?
p170
aVMy right leg will be unburdened,
p171
aVmy right foot will freely meet the wire.
p172
aVOn one side, a mass of a mountain, a life I know.
p173
aVOn the other, the universe of the clouds,
p174
aVso full of unknown we think it's empty.
p175
aVAt my feet, the path to the north tower \u2014 60 yards of wire rope.
p176
aVIt's a straight line, which sags,
p177
aVwhich sways, which vibrates,
p178
aVwhich rolls on itself,
p179
aVwhich is ice,
p180
aVwhich is three tons tight, ready to explode,
p181
aVready to swallow me.
p182
aVAn inner howl assails me,
p183
aVthe wild longing to flee.
p184
aVBut it is too late.
p185
aVThe wire is ready.
p186
aVDecisively my other foot sets itself onto the cable.
p187
aa(lp188
VFaith is what replaces doubt
p189
aVin my dictionary.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo after the walk
p192
aVpeople ask me, "How can you top that?"
p193
aVWell I didn't have that problem.
p194
aVI was not interested in collecting the gigantic,
p195
aVin breaking records.
p196
aVIn fact, I put my World Trade Center crossing
p197
aVat the same artistic level as some of my smaller walks \u2014
p198
aVor some completely different type of performance.
p199
aVLet's see, such as my street juggling, for example.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo each time
p202
aVI draw my circle of chalk on the pavement
p203
aVand enter as the improvising comic silent character
p204
aVI created 45 years ago,
p205
aVI am as happy as when I am in the clouds.
p206
aa(lp207
VBut this here,
p208
aVthis is not the street.
p209
aVSo I cannot street juggle here, you understand.
p210
aVSo you don't want me to street juggle here, right?
p211
aVYou know that, right?
p212
aVYou don't want me to juggle, right?
p213
aa(lp214
V(Applause)
p215
aa(lp216
V(Music)
p217
aa(lp218
V(Applause)
p219
aa(lp220
VThank you. Thank you.
p221
aa(lp222
VEach time I street juggle
p223
aVI use improvisation.
p224
aVNow improvisation is empowering
p225
aVbecause it welcomes the unknown.
p226
aVAnd since what's impossible is always unknown,
p227
aVit allows me to believe I can cheat the impossible.
p228
aa(lp229
VNow I have done the impossible not once,
p230
aVbut many times.
p231
aVSo what should I share? Oh, I know. Israel.
p232
aa(lp233
VSome years ago I was invited to open the Israel Festival
p234
aVby a high-wire walk.
p235
aVAnd I chose to put my wire
p236
aVbetween the Arab quarters and the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem
p237
aVover the Ben Hinnom Valley.
p238
aVAnd I thought it would be incredible
p239
aVif in the middle of the wire
p240
aVI stopped and, like a magician,
p241
aVI produce a dove and send her in the sky
p242
aVas a living symbol of peace.
p243
aa(lp244
VWell now I must say,
p245
aVit was a little bit hard to find a dove in Israel, but I got one.
p246
aVAnd in my hotel room,
p247
aVeach time I practiced making it appear and throwing her in the air,
p248
aVshe would graze the wall and end up on the bed.
p249
aVSo I said, now it's okay. The room is too small.
p250
aVI mean, a bird needs space to fly.
p251
aVIt will go perfectly on the day of the walk.
p252
aa(lp253
VNow comes the day of the walk.
p254
aVEighty thousand people spread over the entire valley.
p255
aVThe mayor of Jerusalem, Teddy Kollek, comes to wish me the best.
p256
aVBut he seemed nervous.
p257
aVThere was tension in my wire,
p258
aVbut I also could feel tension on the ground.
p259
aVBecause all those people
p260
aVwere made up of people who, for the most part,
p261
aVconsidered each other enemies.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo I start the walk. Everything is fine.
p264
aVI stop in the middle.
p265
aVI make the dove appear.
p266
aVPeople applaud in delight.
p267
aVAnd then in the most magnificent gesture,
p268
aVI send the bird of peace into the azure.
p269
aVBut the bird, instead of flying away,
p270
aVgoes flop, flop, flop and lands on my head.
p271
aV(Laughter)
p272
aVAnd people scream.
p273
aVSo I grab the dove,
p274
aVand for the second time I send her in the air.
p275
aVBut the dove, who obviously didn't go to flying school,
p276
aVgoes flop, flop, flop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole.
p277
aa(lp278
V(Laughter)
p279
aa(lp280
VYou laugh, you laugh. But hey.
p281
aVI sit down immediately. It's a reflex of wire walkers.
p282
aVNow in the meantime, the audience, they go crazy.
p283
aVThey must think this guy with this dove,
p284
aVhe must have spent years working with him.
p285
aVWhat a genius, what a professional.
p286
aa(lp287
V(Laughter)
p288
aa(lp289
VSo I take a bow. I salute with my hand.
p290
aVAnd at the end I bang my hand against the pole
p291
aVto dislodge the bird.
p292
aVNow the dove, who, now you know, obviously cannot fly,
p293
aVdoes for the third time a little flop, flop, flop
p294
aVand ends up on the wire behind me.
p295
aVAnd the entire valley goes crazy.
p296
aa(lp297
VNow but hold on, I'm not finished.
p298
aVSo now I'm like 50 yards from my arrival
p299
aVand I'm exhausted, so my steps are slow.
p300
aVAnd something happened.
p301
aVSomebody somewhere, a group of people,
p302
aVstarts clapping in rhythm with my steps.
p303
aVAnd within seconds the entire valley
p304
aVis applauding in unison with each of my steps.
p305
aVBut not an applause of delight like before,
p306
aVan applause encouragement.
p307
aVFor a moment, the entire crowd had forgotten their differences.
p308
aVThey had become one, pushing me to triumph.
p309
aa(lp310
VI want you just for a second
p311
aVto experience this amazing human symphony.
p312
aVSo let's say I am here and the chair is my arrival.
p313
aVSo I walk, you clap, everybody in unison.
p314
aa(lp315
V(Clapping)
p316
aa(lp317
V(Applause)
p318
aa(lp319
VSo after the walk, Teddy and I become friends.
p320
aVAnd he tells me, he has on his desk a picture of me
p321
aVin the middle of the wire with a dove on my head.
p322
aVHe didn't know the true story.
p323
aVAnd whenever he's daunted by an impossible situation
p324
aVto solve in this hard-to-manage city,
p325
aVinstead of giving up, he looks at the picture and he says,
p326
aV"If Philippe can do that, I can do this,"
p327
aVand he goes back to work.
p328
aa(lp329
VInspiration.
p330
aVBy inspiring ourselves
p331
aVwe inspire others.
p332
aVI will never forget this music,
p333
aVand I hope now neither will you.
p334
aVPlease take this music with you home,
p335
aVand start gluing feathers to your arms
p336
aVand take off and fly,
p337
aVand look at the world from a different perspective.
p338
aVAnd when you see mountains,
p339
aVremember mountains can be moved.
p340
aa(lp341
V(Applause)
p342
aa(lp343
VThank you. Thank you.
p344
aVThank you.
