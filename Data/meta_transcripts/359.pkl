VAside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space,
p4
aVarchitecture is nothing but a special-effects machine
p5
aVthat delights and disturbs the senses.
p6
aa(lp7
VOur work is across media. The work comes in all shapes and sizes.
p8
aVIt's small and large. This is an ashtray, a water glass.
p9
aVFrom urban planning and master planning
p10
aVto theater and all sorts of stuff.
p11
aVThe thing that all the work has in common
p12
aVis that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space.
p13
aVAnd these are everyday conventions,
p14
aVconventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity.
p15
aVAnd I've assembled a sampling of work
p16
aVthat all share a kind of productive nihilism
p17
aVthat's used in the service of creating a particular special effect.
p18
aVAnd that is something like nothing, or something next to nothing.
p19
aVIt's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference
p20
aVin a world that we naturally sleepwalk through.
p21
aa(lp22
VThis is an image that won us a competition
p23
aVfor an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo 2002
p24
aVon Lake Neuchatel, near Geneva.
p25
aVAnd we wanted to use the water not only as a context,
p26
aVbut as a primary building material.
p27
aVWe wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere.
p28
aVSo, no walls, no roof, no purpose \u2014
p29
aVjust a mass of atomized water, a big cloud.
p30
aVAnd this proposal was a reaction to the over-saturation
p31
aVof emergent technologies in recent national and world expositions,
p32
aVwhich feeds, or has been feeding, our insatiable appetite
p33
aVfor visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity.
p34
aVHigh definition, in our opinion, has become the new orthodoxy.
p35
aVAnd we ask the question, can we use technology, high technology,
p36
aVto make an expo pavilion that's decidedly low definition,
p37
aVthat also challenges the conventions of space and skin,
p38
aVand rethinks our dependence on vision?
p39
aa(lp40
VSo this is how we sought to do it.
p41
aVWater's pumped from the lake and is filtered
p42
aVand shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles,
p43
aV35,000 of them. And a weather station is on the structure.
p44
aVIt reads the shifting conditions of temperature, humidity,
p45
aVwind direction, wind speed, dew point,
p46
aVand it processes this data in a central computer
p47
aVthat calibrates the degree of water pressure
p48
aVand distribution of water throughout.
p49
aVAnd it's a responsive system that's trained on actual weather.
p50
aVSo, this is just in construction, and there's a tensegrity structure.
p51
aVIt's about 300 feet wide, the size of a football field,
p52
aVand it sits on just four very delicate columns.
p53
aVThese are the fog nozzles, the interface,
p54
aVand basically the system is kind of reading the real weather,
p55
aVand producing kind of semi-artificial and real weather.
p56
aVSo, we're very interested in creating weather. I don't know why.
p57
aa(lp58
VNow, here we go, one side, the outside
p59
aVand then from the inside of the space
p60
aVyou can see what the quality of the space was.
p61
aVUnlike entering any normal space,
p62
aVentering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium.
p63
aVIt's formless, featureless, depthless, scaleless, massless,
p64
aVpurposeless and dimensionless.
p65
aVAll references are erased,
p66
aVleaving only an optical whiteout and white noise of the pulsing nozzles.
p67
aVSo, this is an exhibition pavilion
p68
aVwhere there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do.
p69
aVAnd we pride ourselves \u2014 it's a spectacular anti-spectacle
p70
aVin which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head.
p71
aVSo, the audience is dispersed,
p72
aVfocused attention and dramatic build-up and climax
p73
aVare all replaced by a kind of attenuated attention
p74
aVthat's sustained by a sense of apprehension caused by the fog.
p75
aVAnd this is very much like how the Victorian novel used fog in this way.
p76
aVSo here the world is put out of focus,
p77
aVwhile our visual dependence is put into focus.
p78
aVThe public, you know, once disoriented
p79
aVcan actually ascend to the angel deck above
p80
aVand then just come down under those lips into the water bar.
p81
aVSo, all the waters of the world are served there,
p82
aVso we thought that, you know, after being at the water
p83
aVand moving through the water and breathing the water,
p84
aVyou could also drink this building.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd so it is sort of a theme,
p87
aVbut it goes a little bit, you know, deeper than that.
p88
aVWe really wanted to bring out
p89
aVour absolute dependence on this master sense,
p90
aVand maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses.
p91
aVYou know, when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell,
p92
aVbecause the Swiss said, "Well, why are we going to spend, you know,
p93
aV10 million dollars producing an effect
p94
aVthat we already have in natural abundance that we hate?"
p95
aVAnd, you know, we thought \u2014 well, we tried to convince them.
p96
aVAnd in the end, you know, they adapted this as a national icon
p97
aVthat came to represent Swiss doubt, which we \u2014 you know,
p98
aVit was kind of a meaning machine
p99
aVthat everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of.
p100
aVAnyway, it's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed,
p101
aVand so it's now a memory of an apparition, actually,
p102
aVbut it continues to live in edible form.
p103
aVAnd this is the highest honor
p104
aVto be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland \u2014 to have a chocolate bar.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnyway, moving along.
p107
aVSo in the '80s and '90s, we were mostly known for independent work,
p108
aVsuch as installation artist, architect,
p109
aVcommissioned projects by museums and non-for-profit organizations.
p110
aVAnd we did a lot of media work,
p111
aValso a lot of experimental theater projects.
p112
aVIn 2003, the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work
p113
aVthat featured a lot of this work from the '80s and '90s.
p114
aVHowever, the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective,
p115
aVand this is just some of the stuff that was in the show.
p116
aVThis was a piece on tourism in the United States.
p117
aVThis is "Soft Sell" for 42nd Street.
p118
aVThis was something done at the Cartier Foundation.
p119
aV"Master/Slave" at the MOMA, the project series, a piece called "Parasite."
p120
aVAnd so there were many, many of these kinds of projects.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnyway, they gave us the whole fourth floor, and, you know,
p123
aVthe problem of the retrospective
p124
aVwas something we were very uncomfortable with.
p125
aVIt's a kind of invention of the museum
p126
aVthat's supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding
p127
aVto the public of a body of work.
p128
aVAnd our work doesn't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all.
p129
aVAnd one of the recurring themes, by the way, that in the work
p130
aVwas a kind of hostility toward the museum itself,
p131
aVand asking about the conventions of the museum, like the wall, the white wall.
p132
aVSo, what you see here
p133
aVis basically a plan of many installations that were put there.
p134
aVAnd we actually had to install white walls
p135
aVto separate these pieces, which didn't belong together.
p136
aVBut these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time.
p137
aVWe used the wall to partition the 13 installations of the project
p138
aVand produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd what you see is \u2014 actually,
p141
aVthe red dotted line shows the track of this performing element,
p142
aVwhich was a new piece that created \u2014 that we created for the \u2014
p143
aVwhich was a robotic drill, basically, that went all the way around,
p144
aVcruised the museum, went all around the walls and did a lot of damage.
p145
aVSo, the drill was mounted on this robotic arm.
p146
aVWe worked with, by the way, Honeybee Robotics. This is the brain.
p147
aVHoneybee Robotics designed the Mars Driller,
p148
aVand it was really very much fun to work with them.
p149
aVThey weren't doing their primary work, which was for the government,
p150
aVwhile they were helping us with this.
p151
aVIn any case, the way it works is that
p152
aVan intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls.
p153
aVSo, unfolded it's about 300 linear feet.
p154
aVAnd it randomly generates points within a three-dimensional matrix.
p155
aVIt selects a point, it guides the drill to that point, it pierces the dry wall,
p156
aVleaving a half-inch hole before traveling to the next location.
p157
aVInitially these holes were lone blemishes,
p158
aVand as the exhibition continued
p159
aVthe walls became increasingly perforated.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo eventually holes on both sides of the wall aligned,
p162
aVopening views from gallery to gallery.
p163
aVClusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall.
p164
aVAnd so this was a three-month performance piece
p165
aVin which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element.
p166
aVAnd also the acoustic separation was destroyed.
p167
aVAlso the visual separation.
p168
aVAnd there was also this constant background groan, which was very annoying.
p169
aVAnd this is one of the blackout spaces
p170
aVwhere there's a video piece that became totally not useful.
p171
aVSo rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display,
p172
aVthe wall now actively competed for attention.
p173
aVAnd this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance
p174
aVbasically exposed the discomfort of the work
p175
aVto this encompassing nature of the retrospective.
p176
aVIt was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text.
p177
aa(lp178
VMoving along to a project that we finished about a year ago.
p179
aVIt's the ICA \u2014 the Institute of Contemporary Art \u2014 in Boston,
p180
aVwhich is on the waterfront.
p181
aVAnd there's not enough time to really introduce the building,
p182
aVbut I'll simply say that the building negotiates
p183
aVbetween this outwardly focused nature of the site \u2014
p184
aVyou know, it's a really great waterfront site in Boston \u2014
p185
aVand this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum.
p186
aVSo, the nature of the building is that it looks at looking \u2014
p187
aVI mean that's its primary objective,
p188
aVboth its program and its architectural conceit.
p189
aVThe building incorporates the site,
p190
aVbut it dispenses it in very small doses
p191
aVin the way that the museum is choreographed.
p192
aVSo, you come in and you're basically squeezed by the theater,
p193
aVby the belly of the theater, into this very compressed space
p194
aVwhere the view is turned off.
p195
aVThen you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall.
p196
aVThis elevator's about the size of a New York City studio apartment.
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd then, this is a view going up,
p199
aVand then you could come into the theater,
p200
aVwhich can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop.
p201
aVAnd many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open.
p202
aVThe view is denied in the galleries
p203
aVwhere we receive just natural light,
p204
aVand then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view.
p205
aVThe original intention of this space,
p206
aVwhich was unfortunately never realized,
p207
aVwas to use lenticular glass
p208
aVwhich allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out.
p209
aVIn this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries
p210
aVthe intention was really to not get a climax,
p211
aVbut to have the view stalk you,
p212
aVso the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other.
p213
aVThis was eliminated because the view was too good,
p214
aVand the mayor said, "No, we just want this open."
p215
aVThe architect lost here.
p216
aa(lp217
VBut culminating \u2014 and that's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk \u2014
p218
aVis this Mediatheque,
p219
aVwhich is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building.
p220
aVSo this is an 80-foot cantilever \u2014 it's quite substantial.
p221
aVSo, it's already sticking out into space enough,
p222
aVand then from that is this, is this small area called the Mediatheque.
p223
aVThe Mediatheque has something like 16 stations
p224
aVwhere the public can get onto the server
p225
aVand look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web.
p226
aVAnd this was really a kind of very important part of this building,
p227
aVand here is a point where architecture \u2014
p228
aVthis is like technology-free \u2014 architecture is only a framing device,
p229
aVit only edits the harbor view, the industrial harbor
p230
aVjust through its walls, its floors and its ceiling,
p231
aVto only expose the water itself, the texture of water,
p232
aVmuch like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow
p233
aVor a lava lamp or something like that.
p234
aVAnd here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence
p235
aVof the technological and the natural in the project.
p236
aVBut there is just no information, it's just \u2014 it's just hypnosis.
p237
aa(lp238
VMoving along to Lincoln Center.
p239
aVThese are the guys that did the project in the first place, 50 years ago.
p240
aVWe're taking over now, doing work that ranges in scale
p241
aVfrom small-scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions.
p242
aVBut we're doing it with a lot less testosterone.
p243
aVThis is the extent of the work that's to be completed by 2010.
p244
aVAnd for the purposes of this talk,
p245
aVI wanted to isolate just a part of a project that's even a part of a project
p246
aVthat touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects,
p247
aVand it happens to be our current obsession,
p248
aVand it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction.
p249
aVIt's Alice Tully Hall, and it's tucked under the Juilliard Building
p250
aVand descends several levels under the street.
p251
aVSo, this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be,
p252
aVbefore the renovation, which we just started.
p253
aVAnd we asked ourselves, why couldn't it be exhibitionistic,
p254
aVlike the Met, or like some of the other buildings at Lincoln Center?
p255
aVAnd one of the things that we were asked to do
p256
aVwas give it a street identity, expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible.
p257
aVAnd this building, which is just naturally hermetic, we stripped.
p258
aVWe basically did a striptease, architectural striptease,
p259
aVwhere we're framing with this kind of canopy \u2014
p260
aVthe underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard,
p261
aVabout 45,000 square feet \u2014 cutting it to the angle of Broadway,
p262
aVand then exposing, using that canopy to frame Tully Hall.
p263
aVBefore and after shot. (Applause)
p264
aVWait a minute, it's just in that state, we have a long way to go.
p265
aa(lp266
VBut what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left
p267
aVto just talk about the hall itself,
p268
aVwhich is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work.
p269
aVSo, the hall is a multi-purpose hall.
p270
aVThe clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall.
p271
aVNow, that's really tough to do with a hall that has 1,100 seats.
p272
aVChamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons
p273
aVand small-scale performances. They asked us to bring an intimacy.
p274
aVHow do you bring an intimacy into a hall?
p275
aVIntimacy for us means a lot of different things.
p276
aVIt means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy.
p277
aa(lp278
VOne thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall.
p279
aVAnother thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall.
p280
aVIt's like a coffin, it basically sends all the sound,
p281
aVlike a gutter-ball effect, down the aisles.
p282
aVThe walls are made of absorptive surface,
p283
aVhalf absorptive, half reflective,
p284
aVwhich is not very good for concert sound.
p285
aa(lp286
VThis is Avery Fisher Hall, but the notion of junk \u2014 visual junk \u2014
p287
aVwas very, very important to us, to get rid of visual noise.
p288
aVBecause we can't eliminate a single seat,
p289
aVthe architecture is restricted to 18 inches.
p290
aVSo it's a very, very thin architecture.
p291
aVFirst we do a kind of partial box and box separation,
p292
aVto take away the distraction of the subway noise.
p293
aVNext we wrap the entire hall \u2014 almost like this Olivetti keyboard \u2014
p294
aVwith a material, with a wood material
p295
aVthat basically covers all the surfaces:
p296
aVwall, ceiling, floor, stage, steps, everything, boxes.
p297
aVBut it's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house
p298
aVand back to the stage. And here's an acoustic shelf.
p299
aVLooking up the hall. Just a section of the stage.
p300
aVJust everything is lined, it incorporates \u2014
p301
aVevery single thing that you could possibly imagine
p302
aVis tucked into this high-performance skin.
p303
aVBut one more added feature.
p304
aa(lp305
VSo now that we've stripped the hall of all visual distraction,
p306
aVeverything that prevents this intimacy
p307
aVwhich is supposed to connect the house, the audience,
p308
aVwith the performers, we add one little detail,
p309
aVone piece of architectural excess, a special effect: lighting.
p310
aVWe very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall
p311
aVis as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival
p312
aVas it is when the concert starts.
p313
aVSo what we wanted to do was produce this effect,
p314
aVthis lighting effect,
p315
aVwhich made us have to bioengineer the wood walls.
p316
aVAnd what it entails is the use of resin, of this very thick resin
p317
aVwith a veneer of the same kind of wood that's used throughout the hall,
p318
aVin a kind of seamless continuity
p319
aVthat wraps the hall in light, like a belt of light: rather than separating,
p320
aVlike a proscenium would separate the audience from performers,
p321
aVit connects audience with players.
p322
aa(lp323
VAnd this is a mockup that is in Salt Lake City
p324
aVthat gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale.
p325
aVAnd this is a guy from Salt Lake City,
p326
aVthis is what they look like out there.
p327
aV(Laughter)
p328
aVAnd for us, I mean it's really kind of a very strange thing,
p329
aVbut the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down
p330
aVwhen the audience is waiting for the performance to begin,
p331
aVvery similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier,
p332
aVthe walls will just exude this glow, temporarily stealing attention from the stage.
p333
aVAnd this is Tully in construction now.
p334
aa(lp335
VI have no ending to say, except that I'm a couple of minutes over.
p336
