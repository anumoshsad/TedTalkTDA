VIt was April, last year.
p4
aVI was on an evening out with friends
p5
aVto celebrate one of their birthdays.
p6
aVWe hadn't been all together for a couple of weeks;
p7
aVit was a perfect evening, as we were all reunited.
p8
aa(lp9
VAt the end of the evening,
p10
aVI caught the last underground train back to the other side of London.
p11
aVThe journey was smooth.
p12
aVI got back to my local station
p13
aVand I began the 10-minute walk home.
p14
aVAs I turned the corner onto my street,
p15
aVmy house in sight up ahead,
p16
aVI heard footsteps behind me
p17
aVthat seemed to have approached out of nowhere
p18
aVand were picking up pace.
p19
aVBefore I had time to process what was happening,
p20
aVa hand was clapped around my mouth so that I could not breathe,
p21
aVand the young man behind me dragged me to the ground,
p22
aVbeat my head repeatedly against the pavement
p23
aVuntil my face began to bleed,
p24
aVkicking me in the back and neck
p25
aVwhile he began to assault me,
p26
aVripping off my clothes and telling me to "shut up,"
p27
aVas I struggled to cry for help.
p28
aVWith each smack of my head to the concrete ground,
p29
aVa question echoed through my mind that still haunts me today:
p30
aV"Is this going to be how it all ends?"
p31
aa(lp32
VLittle could I have realized, I'd been followed the whole way
p33
aVfrom the moment I left the station.
p34
aVAnd hours later,
p35
aVI was standing topless and barelegged in front of the police,
p36
aVhaving the cuts and bruises on my naked body photographed
p37
aVfor forensic evidence.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow, there are few words to describe the all-consuming feelings
p40
aVof vulnerability, shame, upset and injustice that I was ridden with
p41
aVin that moment and for the weeks to come.
p42
aVBut wanting to find a way to condense these feelings
p43
aVinto something ordered that I could work through,
p44
aVI decided to do what felt most natural to me:
p45
aVI wrote about it.
p46
aa(lp47
VIt started out as a cathartic exercise.
p48
aVI wrote a letter to my assaulter,
p49
aVhumanizing him as "you,"
p50
aVto identify him as part of the very community
p51
aVthat he had so violently abused that night.
p52
aa(lp53
VStressing the tidal-wave effect of his actions,
p54
aVI wrote:
p55
aV"Did you ever think of the people in your life?
p56
aVI don't know who the people in your life are.
p57
aVI don't know anything about you.
p58
aVBut I do know this:
p59
aVyou did not just attack me that night.
p60
aVI'm a daughter, I'm a friend,
p61
aVI'm a sister, I'm a pupil,
p62
aVI'm a cousin, I'm a niece,
p63
aVI'm a neighbor;
p64
aVI'm the employee who served everyone coffee
p65
aVin the café under the railway.
p66
aVAnd all the people who form these relations to me
p67
aVmake up my community.
p68
aVAnd you assaulted every single one of them.
p69
aVYou violated the truth that I will never cease to fight for,
p70
aVand which all of these people represent:
p71
aVthat there are infinitely more good people in the world than bad."
p72
aa(lp73
VBut, determined not to let this one incident make me lose faith
p74
aVin the solidarity in my community or humanity as a whole,
p75
aVI recalled the 7/7 terrorist bombings in July 2005 on London transport,
p76
aVand how the mayor of London at the time, and indeed my own parents,
p77
aVhad insisted that we all get back on the tubes the next day,
p78
aVso we wouldn't be defined or changed
p79
aVby those that had made us feel unsafe.
p80
aa(lp81
VI told my attacker,
p82
aV"You've carried out your attack,
p83
aVbut now I'm getting back on my tube.
p84
aVMy community will not feel we are unsafe walking home after dark.
p85
aVWe will get on the last tubes home,
p86
aVand we will walk up our streets alone,
p87
aVbecause we will not ingrain or submit to the idea
p88
aVthat we are putting ourselves in danger in doing so.
p89
aVWe will continue to come together, like an army,
p90
aVwhen any member of our community is threatened.
p91
aVAnd this is a fight you will not win."
p92
aa(lp93
VAt the time of writing this letter \u2014
p94
aa(lp95
V(Applause)
p96
aa(lp97
VThank you.
p98
aa(lp99
V(Applause)
p100
aa(lp101
VAt the time of writing this letter,
p102
aVI was studying for my exams in Oxford,
p103
aVand I was working on the local student paper there.
p104
aVDespite being lucky enough to have friends and family supporting me,
p105
aVit was an isolating time.
p106
aVI didn't know anyone who'd been through this before;
p107
aVat least I didn't think I did.
p108
aVI'd read news reports, statistics, and knew how common sexual assault was,
p109
aVyet I couldn't actually name a single person
p110
aVthat I'd heard speak out about an experience of this kind before.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo in a somewhat spontaneous decision,
p113
aVI decided that I would publish my letter in the student paper,
p114
aVhoping to reach out to others in Oxford
p115
aVthat might have had a similar experience and be feeling the same way.
p116
aVAt the end of the letter,
p117
aVI asked others to write in with their experiences
p118
aVunder the hashtag, "#NotGuilty,"
p119
aVto emphasize that survivors of assault could express themselves
p120
aVwithout feeling shame or guilt about what happened to them \u2014
p121
aVto show that we could all stand up to sexual assault.
p122
aa(lp123
VWhat I never anticipated is that almost overnight,
p124
aVthis published letter would go viral.
p125
aVSoon, we were receiving hundreds of stories
p126
aVfrom men and women across the world,
p127
aVwhich we began to publish on a website I set up.
p128
aVAnd the hashtag became a campaign.
p129
aa(lp130
VThere was an Australian mother in her 40s who described how on an evening out,
p131
aVshe was followed to the bathroom
p132
aVby a man who went to repeatedly grab her crotch.
p133
aVThere was a man in the Netherlands
p134
aVwho described how he was date-raped on a visit to London
p135
aVand wasn't taken seriously by anyone he reported his case to.
p136
aVI had personal Facebook messages from people in India and South America,
p137
aVsaying, how can we bring the message of the campaign there?
p138
aVOne of the first contributions we had was from a woman called Nikki,
p139
aVwho described growing up, being molested my her own father.
p140
aVAnd I had friends open up to me
p141
aVabout experiences ranging from those that happened last week
p142
aVto those that happened years ago, that I'd had no idea about.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd the more we started to receive these messages,
p145
aVthe more we also started to receive messages of hope \u2014
p146
aVpeople feeling empowered by this community of voices
p147
aVstanding up to sexual assault and victim-blaming.
p148
aVOne woman called Olivia,
p149
aVafter describing how she was attacked
p150
aVby someone she had trusted and cared about for a long time,
p151
aVsaid, "I've read many of the stories posted here,
p152
aVand I feel hopeful that if so many women can move forward,
p153
aVthen I can, too.
p154
aVI've been inspired by many,
p155
aVand I hope I can be as strong as them someday.
p156
aVI'm sure I will."
p157
aa(lp158
VPeople around the world began tweeting under this hashtag,
p159
aVand the letter was republished and covered by the national press,
p160
aVas well as being translated into several other languages worldwide.
p161
aa(lp162
VBut something struck me about the media attention
p163
aVthat this letter was attracting.
p164
aVFor something to be front-page news,
p165
aVgiven the word "news" itself,
p166
aVwe can assume it must be something new or something surprising.
p167
aVAnd yet sexual assault is not something new.
p168
aVSexual assault, along with other kinds of injustices,
p169
aVis reported in the media all the time.
p170
aVBut through the campaign,
p171
aVthese injustices were framed as not just news stories,
p172
aVthey were firsthand experiences that had affected real people,
p173
aVwho were creating, with the solidarity of others,
p174
aVwhat they needed and had previously lacked:
p175
aVa platform to speak out,
p176
aVthe reassurance they weren't alone or to blame for what happened to them
p177
aVand open discussions that would help to reduce stigma around the issue.
p178
aVThe voices of those directly affected were at the forefront of the story \u2014
p179
aVnot the voices of journalists or commentators on social media.
p180
aVAnd that's why the story was news.
p181
aa(lp182
VWe live in an incredibly interconnected world
p183
aVwith the proliferation of social media,
p184
aVwhich is of course a fantastic resource for igniting social change.
p185
aVBut it's also made us increasingly reactive,
p186
aVfrom the smallest annoyances of, "Oh, my train's been delayed,"
p187
aVto the greatest injustices of war, genocides, terrorist attacks.
p188
aVOur default response has become to leap to react to any kind of grievance
p189
aVby tweeting, Facebooking, hastagging \u2014
p190
aVanything to show others that we, too, have reacted.
p191
aa(lp192
VThe problem with reacting in this manner en masse
p193
aVis it can sometimes mean that we don't actually react at all,
p194
aVnot in the sense of actually doing anything, anyway.
p195
aVIt might make ourselves feel better,
p196
aVlike we've contributed to a group mourning or outrage,
p197
aVbut it doesn't actually change anything.
p198
aVAnd what's more,
p199
aVit can sometimes drown out the voices
p200
aVof those directly affected by the injustice,
p201
aVwhose needs must be heard.
p202
aa(lp203
VWorrying, too, is the tendency for some reactions to injustice
p204
aVto build even more walls,
p205
aVbeing quick to point fingers with the hope of providing easy solutions
p206
aVto complex problems.
p207
aVOne British tabloid, on the publication of my letter,
p208
aVbranded a headline stating,
p209
aV"Oxford Student Launches Online Campaign to Shame Attacker."
p210
aVBut the campaign never meant to shame anyone.
p211
aVIt meant to let people speak and to make others listen.
p212
aVDivisive Twitter trolls were quick to create even more injustice,
p213
aVcommenting on my attacker's ethnicity or class
p214
aVto push their own prejudiced agendas.
p215
aVAnd some even accused me of feigning the whole thing
p216
aVto push, and I quote,
p217
aVmy "feminist agenda of man-hating."
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VI know, right?
p222
aVAs if I'm going to be like, "Hey guys! Sorry I can't make it,
p223
aVI'm busy trying to hate the entire male population
p224
aVby the time I'm 30."
p225
aa(lp226
V(Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VNow, I'm almost sure
p229
aVthat these people wouldn't say the things they say in person.
p230
aVBut it's as if because they might be behind a screen,
p231
aVin the comfort in their own home
p232
aVwhen on social media,
p233
aVpeople forget that what they're doing is a public act \u2014
p234
aVthat other people will be reading it and be affected by it.
p235
aa(lp236
VReturning to my analogy of getting back on our trains,
p237
aVanother main concern I have about this noise that escalates
p238
aVfrom our online responses to injustice
p239
aVis that it can very easily slip into portraying us as the affected party,
p240
aVwhich can lead to a sense of defeatism,
p241
aVa kind of mental barrier to seeing any opportunity for positivity or change
p242
aVafter a negative situation.
p243
aa(lp244
VA couple of months before the campaign started
p245
aVor any of this happened to me,
p246
aVI went to a TEDx event in Oxford,
p247
aVand I saw Zelda la Grange speak,
p248
aVthe former private secretary to Nelson Mandela.
p249
aVOne of the stories she told really struck me.
p250
aVShe spoke of when Mandela was taken to court
p251
aVby the South African Rugby Union
p252
aVafter he commissioned an inquiry into sports affairs.
p253
aVIn the courtroom,
p254
aVhe went up to the South African Rugby Union's lawyers,
p255
aVshook them by the hand
p256
aVand conversed with them, each in their own language.
p257
aVAnd Zelda wanted to protest,
p258
aVsaying they had no right to his respect
p259
aVafter this injustice they had caused him.
p260
aa(lp261
VHe turned to her and said,
p262
aV"You must never allow the enemy to determine the grounds for battle."
p263
aa(lp264
VAt the time of hearing these words,
p265
aVI didn't really know why they were so important,
p266
aVbut I felt they were, and I wrote them down in a notebook I had on me.
p267
aVBut I've thought about this line a lot ever since.
p268
aa(lp269
VRevenge, or the expression of hatred
p270
aVtowards those who have done us injustice
p271
aVmay feel like a human instinct in the face of wrong,
p272
aVbut we need to break out of these cycles
p273
aVif we are to hope to transform negative events of injustice
p274
aVinto positive social change.
p275
aVTo do otherwise
p276
aVcontinues to let the enemy determine the grounds for battle,
p277
aVcreates a binary,
p278
aVwhere we who have suffered become the affected,
p279
aVpitted against them, the perpetrators.
p280
aVAnd just like we got back on our tubes,
p281
aVwe can't let our platforms for interconnectivity and community
p282
aVbe the places that we settle for defeat.
p283
aa(lp284
VBut I don't want to discourage a social media response,
p285
aVbecause I owe the development of the #NotGuilty campaign
p286
aValmost entirely to social media.
p287
aVBut I do want to encourage a more considered approach
p288
aVto the way we use it to respond to injustice.
p289
aa(lp290
VThe start, I think, is to ask ourselves two things.
p291
aVFirstly: Why do I feel this injustice?
p292
aVIn my case, there were several answers to this.
p293
aVSomeone had hurt me and those who I loved,
p294
aVunder the assumption they wouldn't have to be held to account
p295
aVor recognize the damage they had caused.
p296
aVNot only that, but thousands of men and women suffer every day
p297
aVfrom sexual abuse, often in silence,
p298
aVyet it's still a problem we don't give the same airtime to as other issues.
p299
aVIt's still an issue many people blame victims for.
p300
aa(lp301
VNext, ask yourself: How, in recognizing these reasons,
p302
aVcould I go about reversing them?
p303
aVWith us, this was holding my attacker to account \u2014 and many others.
p304
aVIt was calling them out on the effect they had caused.
p305
aVIt was giving airtime to the issue of sexual assault,
p306
aVopening up discussions amongst friends, amongst families, in the media
p307
aVthat had been closed for too long,
p308
aVand stressing that victims shouldn't feel to blame
p309
aVfor what happened to them.
p310
aVWe might still have a long way to go in solving this problem entirely.
p311
aVBut in this way,
p312
aVwe can begin to use social media as an active tool for social justice,
p313
aVas a tool to educate, to stimulate dialogues,
p314
aVto make those in positions of authority aware of an issue
p315
aVby listening to those directly affected by it.
p316
aa(lp317
VBecause sometimes these questions don't have easy answers.
p318
aVIn fact, they rarely do.
p319
aVBut this doesn't mean we still can't give them a considered response.
p320
aVIn situations where you can't go about thinking
p321
aVhow you'd reverse this feeling of injustice,
p322
aVyou can still think, maybe not what you can do,
p323
aVbut what you can not do.
p324
aVYou can not build further walls by fighting injustice with more prejudice,
p325
aVmore hatred.
p326
aVYou can not speak over those directly affected by an injustice.
p327
aVAnd you can not react to injustice, only to forget about it the next day,
p328
aVjust because the rest of Twitter has moved on.
p329
aa(lp330
VSometimes not reacting instantly is, ironically,
p331
aVthe best immediate course of action we can take.
p332
aVBecause we might be angry, upset and energized by injustice,
p333
aVbut let's consider our responses.
p334
aVLet us hold people to account, without descending into a culture
p335
aVthat thrives off shaming and injustice ourselves.
p336
aVLet us remember that distinction,
p337
aVso often forgotten by internet users,
p338
aVbetween criticism and insult.
p339
aVLet us not forget to think before we speak,
p340
aVjust because we might have a screen in front of us.
p341
aVAnd when we create noise on social media,
p342
aVlet it not drown out the needs of those affected,
p343
aVbut instead let it amplify their voices,
p344
aVso the internet becomes a place where you're not the exception
p345
aVif you speak out about something that has actually happened to you.
p346
aa(lp347
VAll these considered approaches to injustice
p348
aVevoke the very keystones on which the internet was built:
p349
aVto network, to have signal, to connect \u2014
p350
aVall these terms that imply bringing people together,
p351
aVnot pushing people apart.
p352
aa(lp353
VBecause if you look up the word "justice" in the dictionary,
p354
aVbefore punishment,
p355
aVbefore administration of law or judicial authority,
p356
aVyou get:
p357
aV"The maintenance of what is right."
p358
aVAnd I think there are few things more "right" in this world
p359
aVthan bringing people together,
p360
aVthan unions.
p361
aVAnd if we allow social media to deliver that,
p362
aVthen it can deliver a very powerful form of justice, indeed.
p363
aa(lp364
VThank you very much.
