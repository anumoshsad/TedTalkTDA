VThree years ago, I got a phone call, based on an earlier film I had made,
p4
aVwith an offer to embed the New Hampshire National Guard.
p5
aVMy idea \u2014 and literally, I woke up in the middle of the night,
p6
aVand we've all have those moments. You know, you go to sleep \u2014
p7
aVI was excited, with this phone call.
p8
aVI was thinking, I just finished making another film about World War II vets,
p9
aVand I realized I'd gotten to know their stories,
p10
aVand I realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
p11
aVto tell a warrior's story as it unfolded.
p12
aVSo I went to bed that night pretty excited.
p13
aVNot sure of all the details, but excited.
p14
aVIt wasn't at four in the morning, but it was closer to midnight.
p15
aVWoke straight up. Wide-awake as could be.
p16
aVAnd I had this idea: what if I could, in effect, virtually embed,
p17
aVand create a permeable relationship with the soldiers?
p18
aVTo tell the story from the inside out, versus the outside in?
p19
aa(lp20
VSo, I called back Major Heilshorn,
p21
aVwho's the public affairs officer of the New Hampshire National Guard.
p22
aVAnd he knew me, so I was like, "Greg?"
p23
aVHe's like, "Yes, Deborah?"
p24
aVTold him my idea, and you know,
p25
aVhe is one of the bravest men in the world,
p26
aVas is General Blair, who, in the end, gave me permission to try this experiment.
p27
aa(lp28
VWithin 10 days, I was down at Fort Dix.
p29
aVHe gave me my pick of units.
p30
aVI picked one unit \u2014 Charlie Company, Third of the 172nd,
p31
aVthey're mountain infantry \u2014 for two reasons.
p32
aVOne, they're infantry.
p33
aVNumber two, they were going to be based at LSA Anaconda,
p34
aVso I knew they would have Internet access.
p35
aVThe caveat for my access was I had to get the soldiers to volunteer.
p36
aVThis was a big thing that
p37
aVI think when Major H told me,
p38
aVI wasn't really totally gathering what that would mean.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo what that meant was, when I went down to Fort Dix,
p41
aVI had to hop out in front of 180 guys and tell them of my vision.
p42
aVYou can imagine the hailstorm of questions I got.
p43
aVThe opening one was,
p44
aV"What the fuck do you know about the National Guard?"
p45
aVI started with the 1607 Massachusetts Bay Colony Pequot Indian Wars.
p46
aVGave them about a nine minute response,
p47
aVand there we went.
p48
aa(lp49
VSo, I'd like to show the clip of the film.
p50
aVIt's our trailer, because I know, obviously you guys are busy,
p51
aVmany of you may not have had a chance to see it.
p52
aVSo, I want to show the trailer,
p53
aVand then I'm going to take apart one scene in detail.
p54
aVIf we could roll?
p55
aa(lp56
V(Video) Stephen Pink: This is Sergeant Stephen Pink.
p57
aa(lp58
VMichael Moriarty: Specialist Michael Moriarty.
p59
aa(lp60
VZack Bazzi: Do I really want to go? Probably not.
p61
aa(lp62
VSoldier: We're not supposed to talk to the media.
p63
aa(lp64
VSP: I'm not the media, dammit!
p65
aa(lp66
VMM: The day is here. Life will change.
p67
aa(lp68
VVoice: The real deal, man! Narrator: You ready?
p69
aVSoldier: Bring it on! Narrator: You ready? Voice 2: Iraq, here we come!
p70
aa(lp71
VZB: Every soldier eventually wants to go in combat.
p72
aVIt's natural instinct.
p73
aa(lp74
VSP: If you let fear get to you,
p75
aVthen you're not going to be doing your job.
p76
aa(lp77
VMM: Every single time you go out there, there's attacks.
p78
aVIt's unbelievable.
p79
aa(lp80
VZB: Hey, Nestor, your ass crack is right in my face.
p81
aa(lp82
VSoldiers: IV! Are we on fire? IV!
p83
aVMan down! Man down!
p84
aa(lp85
VMM: Keep going, brother. You wanna play?
p86
aa(lp87
VMichael Moriarty's Wife: It's really hard for him to not have his dad.
p88
aa(lp89
VMM: This little kid is in the middle of a war zone.
p90
aa(lp91
VStephen Pink's Girlfriend: In the beginning, he's like, "Write something dirty!"
p92
aa(lp93
VGeorge W. Bush: The world's newest democracy.
p94
aa(lp95
VMM: They're shooting at me.
p96
aa(lp97
VSP: You don't put 150,000 troops in there,
p98
aVand say we're there to create democracy.
p99
aa(lp100
VSoldier: We've got a drive through window at Burger King now.
p101
aa(lp102
VSP: We're here to create money.
p103
aa(lp104
VMM: I support George Bush. We're not there for the oil.
p105
aa(lp106
VJon Baril: The worst thing in my life.
p107
aa(lp108
VSP: Baril, don't look at it, bud.
p109
aa(lp110
VMichael Moriarty's Wife: He's not the same person anymore.
p111
aa(lp112
VMM: I will not go back.
p113
aa(lp114
VKevin Shangraw: The Iraqi people are who we are there to help \u2014
p115
aVand we just killed one.
p116
aa(lp117
VSoldiers: Sergeant Smith is down! Sergeant Smith is down?
p118
aVThere they are! Right there! Fire, fire!
p119
aa(lp120
VJB: It'll be a better country in 20 years, 'cause we were there.
p121
aVI hope.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Applause) Deborah Scranton: Thank you.
p124
aVOne of the things I'd like to talk to you about
p125
aVis having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about.
p126
aVAnd I'd like to relate an experience I had here at TED.
p127
aVI don't know how many of you might imagine it,
p128
aVbut there's actually a TEDster who recently got back from Iraq.
p129
aVPaul? Come on, stand up.
p130
aVThis is Paul Anthony.
p131
aVHe served \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 with the Marines,
p132
aVand I want to tell you a little, brief story.
p133
aVWe were one of the lucky ones
p134
aVto get in the class with the Sony cameras and the Vista software.
p135
aVRight? And we started talking.
p136
aVPeople will see my tag, and they'll see "The War Tapes,"
p137
aVand then we'll start talking about war.
p138
aa(lp139
VWe got in a conversation with some other people in the class,
p140
aVand it went on and on.
p141
aVI mean, we were there for an hour, talking.
p142
aVAnd it really highlighted something that I would like to ask
p143
aVyou guys to think about and hopefully to help with,
p144
aVwhich is, I think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war,
p145
aVand about politics.
p146
aVAnd really \u2014 because maybe we're going to disagree.
p147
aVMaybe it's going to get uncomfortable.
p148
aVHow do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation?
p149
aVAnd you know, Paul was talking,
p150
aVand he then turned to Constance and said,
p151
aV"You know, I wouldn't have this conversation if she weren't here,
p152
aVbecause I know she has my back."
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd I want to say, I was nervous.
p155
aVBecause I'm used to doing Q&As.
p156
aVI really related to what James was saying yesterday,
p157
aVbecause I'm behind the camera.
p158
aVYou know, I can answer questions about my movie,
p159
aVbut for me to come up and talk for 18 minutes is a really long time.
p160
aVSo, I wanted to say, Paul, I'm happy you're here,
p161
aVbecause I know you have my back.
p162
aa(lp163
VThis film was not about the Internet,
p164
aVbut it could not have been made without it.
p165
aVThe guys' tapes on average took two weeks to get from Iraq to me.
p166
aVIn the meantime, the soldiers \u2014 we would email and IM.
p167
aVI didn't save all of them,
p168
aVbecause I didn't realize at the beginning
p169
aVthat it would be something that I would want to keep track of.
p170
aVBut there were 3,211 emails and IMs and text messages
p171
aVthat I was able to save.
p172
aVThe reason I quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey
p173
aVto really get inside of it.
p174
aVSo I wanted to show you a clip,
p175
aVand then I was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together.
p176
aVIf we could roll the clip.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Video) SP: Today is sport. [Unclear] Radio: [Unclear] Christian soldiers.
p179
aVSP: We like to give these insurgents a fair chance.
p180
aVSo, what we do, we ride with the windows down.
p181
aVBecause, you know, we obviously have the advantage. I'm just kidding.
p182
aVWe don't fucking ride with the goddam windows down.
p183
aVIt's not true. Very unsafe.
p184
aVWhoa.
p185
aa(lp186
VSoldier: Right there.
p187
aa(lp188
VSP: All right, let's get over to that site.
p189
aVBe advised, we're leaving Taji right now.
p190
aVWe believe that the blast was right outside the gate of Taji,
p191
aVwe're heading to that location now.
p192
aa(lp193
VSoldier: That's a fucking car bomb!
p194
aa(lp195
VSoldier: Motherfuckers!
p196
aa(lp197
VSoldiers: Get your vest on!
p198
aVHey, get over the fucking \u2014 yeah, yeah.
p199
aVAny one-four elements get to the gate!
p200
aa(lp201
VSP: Sheriff one-six, or any one-four elements,
p202
aVwe need you at the gate of Taji right now, over.
p203
aa(lp204
VSoldier: I'll walk you through it.
p205
aV(Voices)
p206
aa(lp207
VSP: Stay low. Head over to the right.
p208
aVGet your bag, get your bag!
p209
aV(Screams)
p210
aa(lp211
VSP: It was mass casualties.
p212
aVProbably 20 dead, at least 20 or 30 wounded Iraqis.
p213
aa(lp214
VSP: It just looked like, you know,
p215
aVsomeone had thrown a quarter through a guy,
p216
aVand it was just like \u2014 there was no blood coming from the shrapnel wounds.
p217
aVEverything was cauterized,
p218
aVand it was just like there was a void going through the body.
p219
aVThis is the scene north.
p220
aVThey just removed a burnt body, or half a body from here.
p221
aVI don't think there was anything left from his abdominal down.
p222
aVThis is blood.
p223
aVAnd you know, you walk,
p224
aVand you hear the pieces of skin.
p225
aVAnd that's it, that's all that's left.
p226
aVI remember giving three IVs, bandaging several wounded.
p227
aVSoldiers sitting in the corner of a sandbag wall, shaking and screaming.
p228
aVMedics who were terrified and couldn't perform.
p229
aVI later heard that Iraqi casualties were not to be treated in Taji.
p230
aVThey can work on the post for pennies, but can't die there.
p231
aVThey've got to die outside.
p232
aVIf one of those incompetent medical officers told me to stop treatment,
p233
aVI would've slit his throat right there.
p234
aV21:00 hours, and it's just our squad
p235
aVgoing through today's events in our heads,
p236
aVwhether we want to or not.
p237
aa(lp238
VNews Anchor: More violence in Iraq.
p239
aVTwin suicide car bombings killed eight Iraqis and wounded dozens more
p240
aVnear a coalition base north of Baghdad.
p241
aa(lp242
VSP: We made the news.
p243
aVI feel exploited and proud at the same time.
p244
aVI've lost all faith in the media \u2014
p245
aVa hapless joke I would much rather laugh at than become a part of.
p246
aVI should really thank God for saving my lucky ass.
p247
aVI'll do that, then I'm gonna jerk off.
p248
aVBecause these pages smell like Linds,
p249
aVand there won't be any time for jerking off tomorrow.
p250
aVAnother mission at 06:00.
p251
aa(lp252
VDS: Now \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 thanks.
p253
aVWhen I said earlier, to try and tell a story from the inside out, versus the outside in \u2014
p254
aVpart of what Chris said so eloquently in his introduction \u2014 is this melding.
p255
aVIt's a new way of trying to make a documentary.
p256
aVWhen I met the guys, and 10 of them agreed to take cameras \u2014
p257
aVin total, 21 ended up filming.
p258
aVFive soldiers filmed the entire time.
p259
aVThere are three featured in the film.
p260
aa(lp261
VThe way I learned about Taji was Steve Pink sent me an email,
p262
aVand in it, attached a photo of that burned body out at the car.
p263
aVAnd the tone from the email was,
p264
aVyou know, it had been a very bad day, obviously.
p265
aVAnd I saw in my IM window that Mike Moriarty was at the base.
p266
aVSo, I pinged Mike and I said,
p267
aV"Mike, can you please go get that interview with Pink?"
p268
aVBecause the thing that very often is missing is,
p269
aVin the military what they call "hot wash."
p270
aVIt's that immediate interview after something immediately happens, you know.
p271
aVAnd if you let time go by,
p272
aVit kind of softens and smooths the edges.
p273
aVAnd for me, I really wanted that.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo, in order to get the intimacy,
p276
aVto share that experience with you, the guys \u2014
p277
aVthe two most popular mounts \u2014
p278
aVthere was a camera on the turret, the gun turret,
p279
aVand then on the dashboard of the Humvee.
p280
aVMost of the Humvees, we ended up mounting two cameras in them.
p281
aVSo you get to experience that in real time, right?
p282
aVThe interview that you see is the one that Mike went and did
p283
aVwithin 24 hours of that episode happening.
p284
aa(lp285
VSteve Pink reading his journal
p286
aVhappened five months after he came home.
p287
aVI knew about that journal, but it was very, very private.
p288
aVAnd you know, you earn someone's trust,
p289
aVespecially in doc filmmaking, through your relationship.
p290
aVSo, it wasn't until five months after he was home
p291
aVthat he would read that journal.
p292
aa(lp293
VNow, the news footage I put in there to try to show \u2014
p294
aVyou know, I think mainstream media tries to do the best they can
p295
aVin the format that they have.
p296
aVBut the thing that I know you all have heard a lot of times,
p297
aVAmerican soldiers saying,
p298
aV"Why don't they talk about the good stuff that we do?"
p299
aVOK, this is a perfect example.
p300
aVPink's squad and another squad spent their entire day outside the wire.
p301
aVThey didn't have to go outside the wire.
p302
aVThere were not Americans hurt out there.
p303
aVThey spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save Iraqi lives \u2014
p304
aVthe Iraqis who work on the post.
p305
aVSo, when you may hear soldiers complaining,
p306
aVthat's what they're talking about, you know?
p307
aVAnd I think it's such an amazing gift that they would share this
p308
aVas a way of bridging.
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd when I talk about that polarity I get at so many different Q&As,
p311
aVand people are really opinionated.
p312
aVBut it seems like people don't want to hear so much,
p313
aVor listen, or try to have an exchange.
p314
aVAnd I'm as fiery as the next person, but I really think \u2014
p315
aVyou know, different speakers have talked about their concern for the world,
p316
aVand my concern is that we have to have these conversations.
p317
aVAnd we have to be able to go into scary places where we may, you know,
p318
aVwe think we know.
p319
aVBut we just have to leave that little bit of openness, to know.
p320
aVThere's such a disconnect.
p321
aVAnd for me, it's trying to bridge that disconnect.
p322
aVI'll share one story.
p323
aVI get \u2014 I'm often asked, you know, for me,
p324
aVwhat have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film.
p325
aVAnd at screenings, inevitably \u2014
p326
aVyou know, as I'm sure all of you obviously do speaking stuff \u2014
p327
aVusually you have people who hang around and want to ask you more questions.
p328
aVAnd usually, the first questions are,
p329
aV"Oh, what kind of cameras did you use?"
p330
aVOr you know, these things.
p331
aa(lp332
VBut there's always a few guys, almost always, who are the last ones.
p333
aVAnd I've learned over time that those are always the soldiers.
p334
aVAnd they wait until pretty much everybody's gone.
p335
aVAnd for me, one of the most profound stories someone shared with me,
p336
aVthat then became my story, was \u2014
p337
aVfor those of you who haven't seen the film, and it's not a spoiler \u2014
p338
aVit's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents,
p339
aVwhere people get in front of Humvees and they get killed.
p340
aVIn this film, there is a scene where an Iraqi woman is killed.
p341
aVA soldier came up to me and stood, you know really, pretty close,
p342
aVa foot away from me.
p343
aVHe's a big guy.
p344
aVAnd he looked at me, and I smiled,
p345
aVand then I saw the tears start welling up in his eyes.
p346
aVAnd he wasn't going to blink.
p347
aVAnd he said, "My gunner was throwing candy."
p348
aVAnd I knew what he was going to say.
p349
aVThe gunner was throwing candy.
p350
aVThey used to throw candy to the kids.
p351
aVKids got too close, very often.
p352
aVAnd he said, "I killed a child.
p353
aVAnd I'm a father. I have children.
p354
aVI haven't been able to tell my wife.
p355
aVI'm afraid she's going to think I'm a monster."
p356
aVI hugged him, of course,
p357
aVand I said, you know, "It's going to be OK."
p358
aVAnd he said, "I'm going to bring her to see your film.
p359
aVAnd then I'm going to tell her."
p360
aa(lp361
VSo when I talk about a disconnect,
p362
aVit's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier,
p363
aVwhich there obviously are. You know, these days,
p364
aVit's not like World War II, where there was a war front and a home front,
p365
aVand everybody seemed involved.
p366
aVYou can go for days here and not feel like there's a war going on.
p367
aVAnd often, I'll hear people say,
p368
aVwho maybe know that I did this film,
p369
aVand they say, "Oh, you know, I'm against the war, but I support the soldiers."
p370
aVAnd I've started to ask them,
p371
aV"Well, that's nice. What are you doing?
p372
aVAre you volunteering at a VA?
p373
aVYou go and see anybody?
p374
aVDo you, if you find out your neighbor's been, do you spend some time?
p375
aVNot necessarily ask questions, but see if they want to talk?
p376
aVDo you give money to any of the charities?"
p377
aVYou know, obviously, like Dean Kamen's working on that amazing thing,
p378
aVbut there's charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers.
p379
aa(lp380
VI think, I challenge us to say \u2014
p381
aVto operationalize those terms, when we say we support someone, you know?
p382
aVAre you a friend to them?
p383
aVDo you really care?
p384
aVAnd I would just say it's my hope, and I would ask you guys
p385
aVto please, you know, reach out a hand.
p386
aVAnd really do give them a hug.
p387
aVThank you.
