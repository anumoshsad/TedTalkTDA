VI'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort
p4
aVthat goes into making the headlines you see in the paper.
p5
aVHeadlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change;
p6
aVand like this when they have to do with air quality or smog.
p7
aVThey're two branches of the same field of atmospheric science.
p8
aa(lp9
VRecently, the headlines looked like this
p10
aVwhen the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC,
p11
aVput out their report
p12
aVon the state of understanding of the atmospheric system.
p13
aVThat report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries.
p14
aVThey wrote almost 1,000 pages on the topic,
p15
aVand all of those pages were reviewed
p16
aVby another 400-plus scientists and reviewers
p17
aVfrom 113 countries.
p18
aVIt's a big community;
p19
aVsuch a big community, in fact,
p20
aVthat our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world.
p21
aa(lp22
VOver 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that.
p23
aVEvery one of those scientists is in a research group,
p24
aVand every research group studies a wide variety of topics.
p25
aVFor us at Cambridge, it's as varied as the El Niño Oscillation,
p26
aVwhich affects weather and climate,
p27
aVto the assimilation of satellite data,
p28
aVto emissions from crops that produce biofuels, which is what I study.
p29
aa(lp30
VAnd in each one of these research areas, of which there are even more,
p31
aVthere are PhD students, like me, and we study incredibly narrow topics,
p32
aVthings as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules.
p33
aVAnd one of the molecules I study is called isoprene, which is here.
p34
aVIt's a small organic molecule.
p35
aVYou've probably never heard of it.
p36
aVThe weight of a paper clip is approximately equal
p37
aVto 900 zeta-illion \u2014 10 to the 21st \u2014 molecules of isoprene.
p38
aa(lp39
VBut despite its very small weight,
p40
aVenough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year
p41
aVto equal the weight of all the people on the planet.
p42
aVIt's a huge amount of stuff. It's equal to the weight of methane.
p43
aVAnd because it's so much stuff,
p44
aVit's really important for the atmospheric system.
p45
aa(lp46
VBecause it's important to the atmospheric system,
p47
aVwe go to all lengths to study this thing.
p48
aVWe blow it up and look at the pieces.
p49
aVThis is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain.
p50
aVAtmospheric explosions, or full combustion,
p51
aVtakes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car.
p52
aVBut still, we look at the pieces.
p53
aa(lp54
VWe run enormous models on supercomputers; this is what I happen to do.
p55
aVOur models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes
p56
aVcalculating hundreds of variables each, on minute timescales.
p57
aVIt takes weeks to perform our integrations,
p58
aVand we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what's happening.
p59
aa(lp60
VWe also fly all over the world looking for this thing.
p61
aVI recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia \u2014 there are others.
p62
aVWe found a global atmospheric watchtower there
p63
aVin the middle of the rainforest,
p64
aVand hung hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of scientific equipment
p65
aVoff this tower,
p66
aVto look for isoprene and other things while we were there.
p67
aVThis is the tower in the middle of the rainforest from above,
p68
aVand the tower from below.
p69
aa(lp70
VOn part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us.
p71
aVAnd this plane, the model BAe-146, which was run by FAAM,
p72
aVnormally flies 120 to 130 people,
p73
aVso maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today.
p74
aVBut we didn't just fly it.
p75
aVWe were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy
p76
aVto measure this molecule \u2014 incredibly dangerous stuff.
p77
aa(lp78
VWe have to fly at a special incline to make the measurements;
p79
aVwe hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering;
p80
aVwe need special flight clearance.
p81
aVAs you come around the banks in these valleys,
p82
aVthe forces can get up to two Gs;
p83
aVthe scientists must be completely harnessed in
p84
aVin order to make measurements while on board.
p85
aVSo as you can imagine,
p86
aVthe inside of the aircraft doesn't look like one you'd take on vacation.
p87
aVIt's a flying laboratory we took to make measurements of this molecule.
p88
aa(lp89
VWe do all this to understand the chemistry of one molecule.
p90
aVAnd when one student like me has some sort of inclination
p91
aVor understanding about that molecule,
p92
aVthey write one scientific paper on the subject.
p93
aVAnd out of that field campaign we'll probably get a few dozen papers
p94
aVon a few dozen processes or molecules.
p95
aa(lp96
VAs a body of knowledge builds up, it will form one subsection,
p97
aVor one sub-subsection,
p98
aVof an assessment like the IPCC, although we have others.
p99
aVAnd each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections.
p100
aVSo you can imagine the scale of the effort.
p101
aVIn each one of the assessments we write, we always tag on a summary,
p102
aVand the summary is written for a non-scientific audience.
p103
aVAnd we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers
p104
aVin order to make headlines like these.
p105
aa(lp106
VThank you very much.
