VSo, people are more afraid of insects than they are of dying.
p4
aV(Laughter)
p5
aVAt least, according to a 1973 "Book of Lists" survey
p6
aVwhich preceded all those online best, worst, funniest lists that you see today.
p7
aVOnly heights and public speaking
p8
aVexceeded the six-legged as sources of fear.
p9
aVAnd I suspect if you had put spiders in there,
p10
aVthe combinations of insects and spiders would have just topped the chart.
p11
aVNow, I am not one of those people.
p12
aVI really love insects.
p13
aVI think they're interesting and beautiful,
p14
aVand sometimes even cute.
p15
aV(Laughter)
p16
aVAnd I'm not alone.
p17
aVFor centuries, some of the greatest minds in science,
p18
aVfrom Charles Darwin to E.O. Wilson,
p19
aVhave drawn inspiration from studying some of the smallest minds on Earth.
p20
aVWell, why is that?
p21
aVWhat is that keeps us coming back to insects?
p22
aVSome of it, of course, is just the sheer magnitude of almost everything about them.
p23
aVThey're more numerous than any other kind of animal.
p24
aVWe don't even know how many species of insects there are,
p25
aVbecause new ones are being discovered all the time.
p26
aVThere are at least a million, maybe as many as 10 million.
p27
aVThis means that you could have an insect-of-the-month calendar
p28
aVand not have to reuse a species for over 80,000 years.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aVTake that, pandas and kittens!
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VMore seriously, insects are essential.
p34
aVWe need them.
p35
aVIt's been estimated that 1 out of every 3 bites of food
p36
aVis made possible by a pollinator.
p37
aVScientist use insects to make fundamental discoveries
p38
aVabout everything from the structure of our nervous systems
p39
aVto how our genes and DNA work.
p40
aVBut what I love most about insects
p41
aVis what they can tell us about our own behavior.
p42
aVInsects seem like they do everything that people do.
p43
aVThey meet, they mate, they fight, they break up.
p44
aVAnd they do so with what looks like love or animosity.
p45
aVBut what drives their behaviors is really different than what drives our own,
p46
aVand that difference can be really illuminating.
p47
aVThere's nowhere where that's more true
p48
aVthan when it comes to one of our most consuming interests \u2014 sex.
p49
aa(lp50
VNow, I will maintain. and I think I can defend,
p51
aVwhat may seem like a surprising statement.
p52
aVI think sex in insects is more interesting than sex in people.
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aVAnd the wild variety that we see
p55
aVmakes us challenge some of our own assumptions
p56
aVabout what it means to be male and female.
p57
aVOf course, to start with,
p58
aVa lot of insects don't need to have sex at all to reproduce.
p59
aVFemale aphids can make little, tiny clones of themselves without ever mating.
p60
aVVirgin birth, right there.
p61
aVOn your rose bushes.
p62
aV(Laughter)
p63
aVWhen they do have sex,
p64
aVeven their sperm is more interesting than human sperm.
p65
aVThere are some kinds of fruit flies
p66
aVwhose sperm is longer than the male's own body.
p67
aVAnd that's important because the males use their sperm to compete.
p68
aVNow, male insects do compete with weapons, like the horns on these beetles.
p69
aVBut they also compete after mating with their sperm.
p70
aVDragonflies and damselflies have penises that look kind of like Swiss Army knives
p71
aVwith all of the attachments pulled out.
p72
aV(Laughter)
p73
aVThey use these formidable devices like scoops,
p74
aVto remove the sperm from previous males that the female has mated with.
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aVSo, what can we learn from this?
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aVAll right, it is not a lesson in the sense of us imitating them
p79
aVor of them setting an example for us to follow.
p80
aVWhich, given this, is probably just as well.
p81
aVAnd also, did I mention sexual cannibalism is rampant among insects?
p82
aVSo, no, that's not the point.
p83
aVBut what I think insects do,
p84
aVis break a lot of the rules that we humans have about the sex roles.
p85
aVSo, people have this idea that nature dictates kind of a 1950s sitcom version
p86
aVof what males and females are like.
p87
aVSo that males are always supposed to be dominant and aggressive,
p88
aVand females are passive and coy.
p89
aa(lp90
VBut that's just not the case.
p91
aVSo for example, take katydids,
p92
aVwhich are relatives of crickets and grasshoppers.
p93
aVThe males are very picky about who they mate with,
p94
aVbecause they not only transfer sperm during mating,
p95
aVthey also give the female something called a nuptial gift.
p96
aVYou can see two katydids mating in these photos.
p97
aVIn both panels, the male's the one on the right,
p98
aVand that sword-like appendage is the female's egg-laying organ.
p99
aVThe white blob is the sperm,
p100
aVthe green blob is the nuptial gift,
p101
aVand the male manufactures this from his own body
p102
aVand it's extremely costly to produce.
p103
aVIt can weigh up to a third of his body mass.
p104
aVI will now pause for a moment and let you think about
p105
aVwhat it would be like if human men, every time they had sex,
p106
aVhad to produce something that weighed 50, 60, 70 pounds.
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aVOkay, they would not be able to do that very often.
p109
aV(Laughter)
p110
aVAnd indeed, neither can the katydids.
p111
aVAnd so what that means
p112
aVis the katydid males are very choosy
p113
aVabout who they offer these nuptial gifts to.
p114
aVNow, the gift is very nutritious,
p115
aVand the female eats it during and after mating.
p116
aVSo, the bigger it is, the better off the male is,
p117
aVbecause that means more time for his sperm
p118
aVto drain into her body and fertilize her eggs.
p119
aVBut it also means that the males are very passive about mating,
p120
aVwhereas the females are extremely aggressive and competitive,
p121
aVin an attempt to get as many of these nutritious nuptial gifts as they can.
p122
aVSo, it's not exactly a stereotypical set of rules.
p123
aVEven more generally though,
p124
aVmales are actually not all that important in the lives of a lot of insects.
p125
aVIn the social insects \u2014 the bees and wasps and ants \u2014
p126
aVthe individuals that you see every day \u2014
p127
aVthe ants going back and forth to your sugar bowl,
p128
aVthe honey bees that are flitting from flower to flower \u2014
p129
aVall of those are always female.
p130
aVPeople have had a hard time getting their head around that idea for millennia.
p131
aVThe ancient Greeks knew that there was a class of bees, the drones,
p132
aVthat are larger than the workers,
p133
aValthough they disapproved of the drones' laziness
p134
aVbecause they could see that the drones just hang around the hive
p135
aVuntil the mating flight \u2014
p136
aVthey're the males.
p137
aVThey hang around until the mating flight,
p138
aVbut they don't participate in gathering nectar or pollen.
p139
aVThe Greeks couldn't figure out the drones' sex,
p140
aVand part of the confusion was that they were aware of the stinging ability of bees
p141
aVbut they found it difficult to believe
p142
aVthat any animals that bore such a weapon could possibly be a female.
p143
aVAristotle tried to get involved as well.
p144
aVHe suggested, "OK, if the stinging individuals are going to be the males ..."
p145
aVThen he got confused, because that would have meant
p146
aVthe males were also taking care of the young in a colony,
p147
aVand he seemed to think that would be completely impossible.
p148
aVHe then concluded that maybe bees had the organs of both sexes
p149
aVin the same individual,
p150
aVwhich is not that far-fetched, some animals do that,
p151
aVbut he never really did get it figured out.
p152
aVAnd you know, even today, my students, for instance,
p153
aVcall every animal they see, including insects, a male.
p154
aVAnd when I tell them that the ferocious army-ant soldiers
p155
aVwith their giant jaws, used to defend the colony,
p156
aVare all always female,
p157
aVthey seem to not quite believe me.
p158
aV(Laughter)
p159
aVAnd certainly all of the movies \u2014 Antz, Bee Movie \u2014
p160
aVportray the main character in the social insects as being male.
p161
aVWell, what difference does this make?
p162
aVThese are movies. They're fiction.
p163
aVThey have talking animals in them.
p164
aVWhat difference does it make if they talk like Jerry Seinfeld?
p165
aVI think it does matter,
p166
aVand it's a problem that actually is part of a much deeper one
p167
aVthat has implications for medicine and health
p168
aVand a lot of other aspects of our lives.
p169
aVYou all know that scientists use what we call model systems,
p170
aVwhich are creatures \u2014 white rats or fruit flies \u2014
p171
aVthat are kind of stand-ins for all other animals, including people.
p172
aVAnd the idea is that what's true for a person
p173
aVwill also be true for the white rat.
p174
aVAnd by and large, that turns out to be the case.
p175
aVBut you can take the idea of a model system too far.
p176
aVAnd what I think we've done,
p177
aVis use males, in any species, as though they are the model system.
p178
aVThe norm.
p179
aVThe way things are supposed to be.
p180
aVAnd females as a kind of variant \u2014
p181
aVsomething special that you only study after you get the basics down.
p182
aVAnd so, back to the insects.
p183
aVI think what that means
p184
aVis that people just couldn't see what was in front of them.
p185
aVBecause they assumed that the world's stage was largely occupied by male players
p186
aVand females would only have minor, walk-on roles.
p187
aVBut when we do that, we really miss out on a lot of what nature is like.
p188
aVAnd we can also miss out on the way natural, living things, including people,
p189
aVcan vary.
p190
aVAnd I think that's why we've used males as models in a lot of medical research,
p191
aVsomething that we know now to be a problem
p192
aVif we want the results to apply to both men and women.
p193
aVWell, the last thing I really love about insects
p194
aVis something that a lot of people find unnerving about them.
p195
aVThey have little, tiny brains
p196
aVwith very little cognitive ability, the way we normally think of it.
p197
aVThey have complicated behavior, but they lack complicated brains.
p198
aVAnd so, we can't just think of them as though they're little people
p199
aVbecause they don't do things the way that we do.
p200
aVI really love that it's difficult to anthropomorphize insects,
p201
aVto look at them and just think of them like they're little people
p202
aVin exoskeletons, with six legs.
p203
aV(Laughter)
p204
aVInstead, you really have to accept them on their own terms,
p205
aVbecause insects make us question what's normal and what's natural.
p206
aVNow, you know, people write fiction and talk about parallel universes.
p207
aVThey speculate about the supernatural,
p208
aVmaybe the spirits of the departed walking among us.
p209
aVThe allure of another world
p210
aVis something that people say is part of why they want to dabble in the paranormal.
p211
aVBut as far as I'm concerned,
p212
aVwho needs to be able to see dead people,
p213
aVwhen you can see live insects?
p214
aVThank you.
