VSo, people want a lot of things out of life,
p4
aVbut I think, more than anything else, they want happiness.
p5
aVAristotle called happiness "the chief good," the end
p6
aVtowards which all other things aim.
p7
aVAccording to this view, the reason we want a big house
p8
aVor a nice car
p9
aVor a good job
p10
aVisn't that these things are intrinsically valuable.
p11
aVIt's that we expect them to bring us
p12
aVhappiness.
p13
aa(lp14
VNow in the last 50 years, we Americans have gotten
p15
aVa lot of the things that we want. We're richer.
p16
aVWe live longer. We have access to technology
p17
aVthat would have seemed like science fiction
p18
aVjust a few years ago.
p19
aVThe paradox of happiness is that even though the
p20
aVobjective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically,
p21
aVwe haven't actually gotten any happier.
p22
aa(lp23
VMaybe because these conventional notions of progress
p24
aVhaven't delivered big benefits in terms of happiness,
p25
aVthere's been an increased interest in recent years
p26
aVin happiness itself.
p27
aVPeople have been debating the causes of happiness
p28
aVfor a really long time, in fact for thousands of years,
p29
aVbut it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved.
p30
aVWell, as with many other domains in life, I think
p31
aVthe scientific method has the potential to answer this question.
p32
aVIn fact, in the last few years, there's been an explosion
p33
aVin research on happiness. For example, we've learned a lot
p34
aVabout its demographics, how things like income
p35
aVand education, gender and marriage relate to it.
p36
aVBut one of the puzzles this has revealed is that
p37
aVfactors like these don't seem to have a particularly strong effect.
p38
aVYes, it's better to make more money rather than less,
p39
aVor to graduate from college instead of dropping out,
p40
aVbut the differences in happiness tend to be small.
p41
aa(lp42
VWhich leaves the question, what are the big causes of happiness?
p43
aVI think that's a question we haven't really answered yet,
p44
aVbut I think something that has the potential to be an answer
p45
aVis that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with
p46
aVthe contents of our moment-to-moment experiences.
p47
aVIt certainly seems that we're going about our lives,
p48
aVthat what we're doing, who we're with, what we're thinking about,
p49
aVhave a big influence on our happiness, and yet
p50
aVthese are the very factors that have been very difficult,
p51
aVin fact almost impossible, for scientists to study.
p52
aa(lp53
VA few years ago, I came up with a way to study people's happiness
p54
aVmoment to moment as they're going about their daily lives
p55
aVon a massive scale all over the world, something we'd never
p56
aVbeen able to do before. Called trackyourhappiness.org,
p57
aVit uses the iPhone to monitor people's happiness in real time.
p58
aVHow does this work? Basically, I send people signals
p59
aVat random points throughout the day, and then I ask them
p60
aVa bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience
p61
aVat the instant just before the signal.
p62
aVThe idea is that, if we can watch how people's happiness
p63
aVgoes up and down over the course of the day,
p64
aVminute to minute in some cases,
p65
aVand try to understand how what people are doing,
p66
aVwho they're with, what they're thinking about, and all
p67
aVthe other factors that describe our day, how those might
p68
aVrelate to those changes in happiness, we might be able
p69
aVto discover some of the things that really have
p70
aVa big influence on happiness.
p71
aVWe've been fortunate with this project to collect
p72
aVquite a lot of data, a lot more data of this kind than I think
p73
aVhas ever been collected before,
p74
aVover 650,000 real-time reports
p75
aVfrom over 15,000 people.
p76
aVAnd it's not just a lot of people, it's a really diverse group,
p77
aVpeople from a wide range of ages, from 18 to late 80s,
p78
aVa wide range of incomes, education levels,
p79
aVpeople who are married, divorced, widowed, etc.
p80
aVThey collectively represent every one of
p81
aV86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries.
p82
aa(lp83
VWhat I'd like to do with the rest of my time with you today
p84
aVis talk a little bit about one of the areas that we've been
p85
aVinvestigating, and that's mind-wandering.
p86
aVAs human beings, we have this unique ability
p87
aVto have our minds stray away from the present.
p88
aVThis guy is sitting here working on his computer,
p89
aVand yet he could be thinking about
p90
aVthe vacation he had last month,
p91
aVwondering what he's going to have for dinner.
p92
aVMaybe he's worried that he's going bald. (Laughter)
p93
aVThis ability to focus our attention on something other
p94
aVthan the present is really amazing. It allows us to learn
p95
aVand plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can.
p96
aVAnd yet it's not clear what the relationship is
p97
aVbetween our use of this ability and our happiness.
p98
aVYou've probably heard people suggest that you should
p99
aVstay focused on the present. "Be here now,"
p100
aVyou've probably heard a hundred times.
p101
aVMaybe, to really be happy, we need to stay completely
p102
aVimmersed and focused on our experience in the moment.
p103
aVMaybe these people are right. Maybe mind-wandering
p104
aVis a bad thing.
p105
aVOn the other hand, when our minds wander,
p106
aVthey're unconstrained. We can't change the physical reality
p107
aVin front of us, but we can go anywhere in our minds.
p108
aVSince we know people want to be happy, maybe
p109
aVwhen our minds wander, they're going to someplace happier than the place
p110
aVthat they're leaving. It would make a lot of sense.
p111
aVIn other words, maybe the pleasures of the mind
p112
aVallow us to increase our happiness with mind-wandering.
p113
aa(lp114
VWell, since I'm a scientist, I'd like to try to
p115
aVresolve this debate with some data, and in particular
p116
aVI'd like to present some data to you from three questions
p117
aVthat I ask with Track Your Happiness. Remember, this is from
p118
aVsort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives.
p119
aVThere are three questions. The first one is a happiness question:
p120
aVHow do you feel, on a scale ranging from very bad
p121
aVto very good? Second, an activity question:
p122
aVWhat are you doing, on a list of 22 different activities
p123
aVincluding things like eating and working and watching TV?
p124
aVAnd finally a mind-wandering question:
p125
aVAre you thinking about something other
p126
aVthan what you're currently doing?
p127
aVPeople could say no \u2014 in other words, I'm focused only on my task \u2014
p128
aVor yes \u2014 I am thinking about something else \u2014
p129
aVand the topic of those thoughts are pleasant,
p130
aVneutral or unpleasant.
p131
aVAny of those yes responses are what we called mind-wandering.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo what did we find?
p134
aVThis graph shows happiness on the vertical axis,
p135
aVand you can see that bar there representing how happy
p136
aVpeople are when they're focused on the present,
p137
aVwhen they're not mind-wandering.
p138
aVAs it turns out, people are substantially less happy
p139
aVwhen their minds are wandering than when they're not.
p140
aVNow you might look at this result and say, okay, sure,
p141
aVon average people are less happy when they're mind-wandering,
p142
aVbut surely when their minds are straying away
p143
aVfrom something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with,
p144
aVat least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us.
p145
aVNope. As it turns out,
p146
aVpeople are less happy when they're mind-wandering
p147
aVno matter what they're doing. For example,
p148
aVpeople don't really like commuting to work very much.
p149
aVIt's one of their least enjoyable activities, and yet
p150
aVthey are substantially happier when they're focused
p151
aVonly on their commute than when their mind is going
p152
aVoff to something else.
p153
aVIt's amazing.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo how could this be happening? I think part of the reason,
p156
aVa big part of the reason, is that when our minds wander,
p157
aVwe often think about unpleasant things, and they are
p158
aVenormously less happy when they do that,
p159
aVour worries, our anxieties, our regrets,
p160
aVand yet even when people are thinking about something
p161
aVneutral, they're still considerably less happy
p162
aVthan when they're not mind-wandering at all.
p163
aVEven when they're thinking about something they would describe as pleasant,
p164
aVthey're actually just slightly less happy
p165
aVthan when they aren't mind-wandering.
p166
aVIf mind-wandering were a slot machine, it would be like
p167
aVhaving the chance to lose 50 dollars, 20 dollars
p168
aVor one dollar. Right? You'd never want to play. (Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VSo I've been talking about this, suggesting, perhaps,
p171
aVthat mind-wandering causes unhappiness, but all
p172
aVI've really shown you is that these two things are correlated.
p173
aVIt's possible that's the case, but it might also be the case
p174
aVthat when people are unhappy, then they mind-wander.
p175
aVMaybe that's what's really going on. How could we ever
p176
aVdisentangle these two possibilites?
p177
aVWell, one fact that we can take advantage of, I think a fact
p178
aVyou'll all agree is true, is that time goes forward, not
p179
aVbackward. Right? The cause has to come before the effect.
p180
aVWe're lucky in this data we have many responses from each person,
p181
aVand so we can look and see, does mind-wandering
p182
aVtend to precede unhappiness, or does unhappiness
p183
aVtend to precede mind-wandering, to get some insight
p184
aVinto the causal direction.
p185
aVAs it turns out, there is a strong relationship between
p186
aVmind-wandering now and being unhappy a short time later,
p187
aVconsistent with the idea that mind-wandering is causing people to be unhappy.
p188
aVIn contrast, there's no relationship between being unhappy
p189
aVnow and mind-wandering a short time later.
p190
aVIn other words, mind-wandering very likely seems to be
p191
aVan actual cause, and not merely a consequence, of unhappiness.
p192
aa(lp193
VA few minutes ago, I likened mind-wandering
p194
aVto a slot machine you'd never want to play.
p195
aVWell, how often do people's minds wander?
p196
aVTurns out, they wander a lot. In fact, really a lot.
p197
aVForty-seven percent of the time, people are thinking
p198
aVabout something other than what they're currently doing.
p199
aVHow does that depend on what people are doing?
p200
aVThis shows the rate of mind-wandering across 22 activities
p201
aVranging from a high of 65 percent \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p202
aVwhen people are taking a shower, brushing their teeth,
p203
aVto 50 percent when they're working,
p204
aVto 40 percent when they're exercising,
p205
aVall the way down to this one short bar on the right
p206
aVthat I think some of you are probably laughing at.
p207
aVTen percent of the time people's minds are wandering
p208
aVwhen they're having sex. (Laughter)
p209
aVBut there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph,
p210
aVand that is, basically with one exception,
p211
aVno matter what people are doing, they're mind-wandering
p212
aVat least 30 percent of the time, which suggests, I think,
p213
aVthat mind-wandering isn't just frequent, it's ubiquitous.
p214
aVIt pervades basically everything that we do.
p215
aa(lp216
VIn my talk today, I've told you a little bit about mind-wandering,
p217
aVa variable that I think turns out to be fairly important
p218
aVin the equation for happiness.
p219
aVMy hope is that over time, by tracking people's
p220
aVmoment-to-moment happiness and their experiences
p221
aVin daily life, we'll be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness,
p222
aVand then in the end, a scientific understanding of happiness
p223
aVwill help us create a future that's not only richer
p224
aVand healthier, but happier as well.
p225
aVThank you. (Applause)
