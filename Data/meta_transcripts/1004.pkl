VI'm here today to show my photographs of the Lakota.
p4
aVMany of you may have heard of the Lakota,
p5
aVor at least the larger group of tribes,
p6
aVcalled the Sioux.
p7
aVThe Lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their land
p8
aVto prisoner-of-war camps,
p9
aVnow called reservations.
p10
aVThe Pine Ridge Reservation,
p11
aVthe subject of today's slide show,
p12
aVis located about 75 miles southeast of the Black Hills in South Dakota.
p13
aVIt is sometimes referred to as Prisoner of War Camp Number 334,
p14
aVand it is where the Lakota now live.
p15
aVNow, if any of you have ever heard of AIM,
p16
aVthe American Indian Movement,
p17
aVor of Russell Means,
p18
aVor Leonard Peltier,
p19
aVor of the standoff at Oglala,
p20
aVthen you know Pine Ridge is ground zero for Native issues in the US.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo I've been asked to talk a little bit today
p23
aVabout my relationship with the Lakota,
p24
aVand that's a very difficult one for me,
p25
aVbecause, if you haven't noticed from my skin color,
p26
aVI'm white,
p27
aVand that is a huge barrier on a Native reservation.
p28
aVYou'll see a lot of people in my photographs today.
p29
aVI've become very close with them, and they've welcomed me like family.
p30
aVThey've called me "brother" and "uncle,"
p31
aVand invited me again and again over five years.
p32
aVBut on Pine Ridge,
p33
aVI will always be what is called "wasichu."
p34
aV"Wasichu" is a Lakota word
p35
aVthat means "non-Indian,"
p36
aVbut another version of this word
p37
aVmeans "the one who takes the best meat for himself."
p38
aVAnd that's what I want to focus on \u2014
p39
aVthe one who takes the best part of the meat.
p40
aVIt means "greedy."
p41
aa(lp42
VSo take a look around this auditorium today.
p43
aVWe are at a private school in the American West,
p44
aVsitting in red velvet chairs
p45
aVwith money in our pockets.
p46
aVAnd if we look at our lives,
p47
aVwe have indeed taken the best part of the meat.
p48
aVSo let's look today at a set of photographs
p49
aVof a people who lost
p50
aVso that we could gain,
p51
aVand know that when you see these people's faces,
p52
aVthat these are not just images of the Lakota;
p53
aVthey stand for all indigenous people.
p54
aa(lp55
VOn this piece of paper
p56
aVis the history the way I learned it from my Lakota friends and family.
p57
aVThe following is a time line of treaties made, treaties broken
p58
aVand massacres disguised as battles.
p59
aVI'll begin in 1824.
p60
aVWhat is known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs
p61
aVwas created within the War Department,
p62
aVsetting an early tone of aggression
p63
aVin our dealings with the Native Americans.
p64
aa(lp65
V1851:
p66
aVThe first treaty of Fort Laramie was made,
p67
aVclearly marking the boundaries of the Lakota Nation.
p68
aVAccording to the treaty, those lands are a sovereign nation.
p69
aVIf the boundaries of this treaty had held \u2014
p70
aVand there is a legal basis that they should \u2014
p71
aVthen this is what the US would look like today.
p72
aVTen years later.
p73
aVThe Homestead Act, signed by President Lincoln,
p74
aVunleashed a flood of white settlers into Native lands.
p75
aa(lp76
V1863:
p77
aVAn uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota
p78
aVends with the hanging of 38 Sioux men,
p79
aVthe largest mass execution in US history.
p80
aVThe execution was ordered by President Lincoln,
p81
aVonly two days after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
p82
aa(lp83
V1866: The beginning of the Transcontinental Railroad \u2014
p84
aVa new era.
p85
aVWe appropriated land for trails and trains
p86
aVto shortcut through the heart of the Lakota Nation.
p87
aVThe treaties were out the window.
p88
aVIn response, three tribes led by the Lakota chief Red Cloud
p89
aVattacked and defeated the US army,
p90
aVmany times over.
p91
aVI want to repeat that part:
p92
aVThe Lakota defeat the US army.
p93
aa(lp94
V1868: The second Fort Laramie Treaty clearly guarantees
p95
aVthe sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation
p96
aVand the Lakotas' ownership of the sacred Black Hills.
p97
aVThe government also promises land and hunting rights
p98
aVin the surrounding states.
p99
aVWe promise that the Powder River country
p100
aVwill henceforth be closed to all whites.
p101
aVThe treaty seemed to be a complete victory
p102
aVfor Red Cloud and the Sioux.
p103
aVIn fact, this is the only war in American history
p104
aVin which the government negotiated a peace
p105
aVby conceding everything demanded by the enemy.
p106
aa(lp107
V1869: The Transcontinental Railroad was completed.
p108
aVIt began carrying, among other things, large numbers of hunters,
p109
aVwho began the wholesale killing of buffalo,
p110
aVeliminating a source of food, clothing and shelter for the Sioux.
p111
aa(lp112
V1871:
p113
aVThe Indian Appropriation Act
p114
aVmakes all Indians wards of the federal government.
p115
aVIn addition, the military issued orders
p116
aVforbidding western Indians from leaving reservations.
p117
aVAll western Indians at that point in time were now prisoners of war.
p118
aVAlso in 1871,
p119
aVwe ended the time of treaty-making.
p120
aVThe problem with treaties is they allow tribes to exist as sovereign nations,
p121
aVand we can't have that.
p122
aVWe had plans.
p123
aa(lp124
V1874:
p125
aVGeneral George Custer announced the discovery of gold in Lakota territory,
p126
aVspecifically the Black Hills.
p127
aVThe news of gold creates a massive influx of white settlers
p128
aVinto Lakota Nation.
p129
aVCuster recommends that Congress find a way
p130
aVto end the treaties with the Lakota as soon as possible.
p131
aa(lp132
V1875: The Lakota war begins
p133
aVover the violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty.
p134
aV1876:
p135
aVOn July 26th,
p136
aVon its way to attack a Lakota village,
p137
aVCuster's 7th Cavalry was crushed
p138
aVat the battle of Little Big Horn.
p139
aV1877:
p140
aVThe great Lakota warrior and chief named Crazy Horse
p141
aVsurrendered at Fort Robinson.
p142
aVHe was later killed while in custody.
p143
aV1877 is also the year we found a way to get around the Fort Laramie Treaties.
p144
aVA new agreement was presented to Sioux chiefs and their leading men,
p145
aVunder a campaign known as "Sell or Starve" \u2014
p146
aVsign the paper, or no food for your tribe.
p147
aVOnly 10 percent of the adult male population signed.
p148
aVThe Fort Laramie Treaty called for at least three-quarters of the tribe
p149
aVto sign away land.
p150
aVThat clause was obviously ignored.
p151
aa(lp152
V1887: The Dawes Act.
p153
aVCommunal ownership of reservation lands ends.
p154
aVReservations are cut up into 160-acre sections,
p155
aVand distributed to individual Indians
p156
aVwith the surplus disposed of.
p157
aVTribes lost millions of acres.
p158
aVThe American dream of individual land ownership
p159
aVturned out to be a very clever way
p160
aVto divide the reservation until nothing was left.
p161
aVThe move destroyed the reservations,
p162
aVmaking it easier to further subdivide and to sell
p163
aVwith every passing generation.
p164
aVMost of the surplus land
p165
aVand many of the plots within reservation boundaries
p166
aVare now in the hands of white ranchers.
p167
aVOnce again, the fat of the land goes to wasichu.
p168
aa(lp169
V1890: A date I believe to be the most important in this slide show.
p170
aVThis is the year of the Wounded Knee Massacre.
p171
aVOn December 29,
p172
aVUS troops surrounded a Sioux encampment at Wounded Knee Creek,
p173
aVand massacred Chief Big Foot and 300 prisoners of war,
p174
aVusing a new rapid-fire weapon that fired exploding shells,
p175
aVcalled a Hotchkiss gun.
p176
aVFor this so-called "battle,"
p177
aV20 Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor
p178
aVwere given to the 7th Cavalry.
p179
aVTo this day,
p180
aVthis is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle.
p181
aVMore Medals of Honor were given
p182
aVfor the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children
p183
aVthan for any battle in World War One,
p184
aVWorld War Two,
p185
aVKorea, Vietnam,
p186
aVIraq or Afghanistan.
p187
aa(lp188
VThe Wounded Knee Massacre is considered the end of the Indian wars.
p189
aVWhenever I visit the site of the mass grave at Wounded Knee,
p190
aVI see it not just as a grave for the Lakota or for the Sioux,
p191
aVbut as a grave for all indigenous peoples.
p192
aVThe holy man Black Elk, said,
p193
aV"I did not know then how much was ended.
p194
aVWhen I look back now from this high hill of my old age,
p195
aVI can still see the butchered women and children
p196
aVlying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch,
p197
aVas plain as when I saw them
p198
aVwith eyes still young.
p199
aVAnd I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud
p200
aVand was buried in the blizzard.
p201
aVA people's dream died there.
p202
aVAnd it was a beautiful dream."
p203
aa(lp204
VWith this event,
p205
aVa new era in Native American history began.
p206
aVEverything can be measured before Wounded Knee and after,
p207
aVbecause it was in this moment,
p208
aVwith the fingers on the triggers of the Hotchkiss guns,
p209
aVthat the US government openly declared its position on Native rights.
p210
aVThey were tired of treaties.
p211
aVThey were tired of sacred hills.
p212
aVThey were tired of ghost dances.
p213
aVAnd they were tired of all the inconveniences of the Sioux.
p214
aVSo they brought out their cannons.
p215
aV"You want to be an Indian now?" they said,
p216
aVfinger on the trigger.
p217
aa(lp218
V1900:
p219
aVthe US Indian population reached its low point \u2014
p220
aVless than 250,000,
p221
aVcompared to an estimated eight million in 1492.
p222
aa(lp223
VFast-forward.
p224
aV1980:
p225
aVThe longest-running court case in US history,
p226
aVthe Sioux Nation versus the United States,
p227
aVwas ruled upon by the US Supreme Court.
p228
aVThe court determined that when the Sioux were resettled onto reservations
p229
aVand seven million acres of their land were opened up
p230
aVto prospectors and homesteaders,
p231
aVthe terms of the second Fort Laramie Treaty
p232
aVhad been violated.
p233
aVThe court stated that the Black Hills were illegally taken,
p234
aVand that the initial offering price, plus interest,
p235
aVshould be paid to the Sioux Nation.
p236
aVAs payment for the Black Hills,
p237
aVthe court awarded only 106 million dollars to the Sioux Nation.
p238
aVThe Sioux refused the money with the rallying cry,
p239
aV"The Black Hills are not for sale."
p240
aa(lp241
V2010:
p242
aVStatistics about Native population today,
p243
aVmore than a century after the massacre at Wounded Knee,
p244
aVreveal the legacy of colonization,
p245
aVforced migration
p246
aVand treaty violations.
p247
aVUnemployment on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation
p248
aVfluctuates between 85 and 90 percent.
p249
aVThe housing office is unable to build new structures,
p250
aVand existing structures are falling apart.
p251
aVMany are homeless,
p252
aVand those with homes are packed into rotting buildings
p253
aVwith up to five families.
p254
aVThirty-nine percent of homes on Pine Ridge
p255
aVhave no electricity.
p256
aVAt least 60 percent of the homes on the reservation
p257
aVare infested with black mold.
p258
aVMore than 90 percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line.
p259
aVThe tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge
p260
aVis approximately eight times higher than the US national average.
p261
aVThe infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent,
p262
aVand is about three times higher than the US national average.
p263
aVCervical cancer is five times higher
p264
aVthan the US national average.
p265
aVThe school dropout rate is up to 70 percent.
p266
aVTeacher turnover is eight times higher than the US national average.
p267
aVFrequently, grandparents are raising their grandchildren
p268
aVbecause parents, due to alcoholism,
p269
aVdomestic violence and general apathy,
p270
aVcannot raise them.
p271
aVFifty percent of the population over the age of 40
p272
aVsuffers from diabetes.
p273
aVThe life expectancy for men is between 46 and 48 years old \u2014
p274
aVroughly the same as in Afghanistan and Somalia.
p275
aa(lp276
VThe last chapter in any successful genocide
p277
aVis the one in which the oppressor
p278
aVcan remove their hands and say,
p279
aV"My god \u2014 what are these people doing to themselves?
p280
aVThey're killing each other.
p281
aVThey're killing themselves
p282
aVwhile we watch them die."
p283
aVThis is how we came to own these United States.
p284
aVThis is the legacy
p285
aVof Manifest Destiny.
p286
aVPrisoners are still born into prisoner of war camps,
p287
aVlong after the guards are gone.
p288
aVThese are the bones left after the best meat has been taken.
p289
aa(lp290
VA long time ago,
p291
aVa series of events was set in motion
p292
aVby a people who look like me, by wasichu,
p293
aVeager to take the land and the water and the gold in the hills.
p294
aVThose events led to a domino effect that has yet to end.
p295
aa(lp296
VAs removed as we, the dominant society, may feel
p297
aVfrom a massacre in 1890,
p298
aVor a series of broken treaties 150 years ago,
p299
aVI still have to ask you the question:
p300
aVHow should you feel about the statistics of today?
p301
aVWhat is the connection between these images of suffering
p302
aVand the history that I just read to you?
p303
aVAnd how much of this history do you need to own, even?
p304
aVIs any of this your responsibility today?
p305
aVI have been told that there must be something we can do.
p306
aVThere must be some call to action.
p307
aVBecause for so long, I've been standing on the sidelines,
p308
aVcontent to be a witness,
p309
aVjust taking photographs.
p310
aVBecause the solutions seem so far in the past,
p311
aVI needed nothing short of a time machine to access them.
p312
aa(lp313
VThe suffering of indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to fix.
p314
aVIt's not something everyone can get behind
p315
aVthe way they get behind helping Haiti,
p316
aVor ending AIDS, or fighting a famine.
p317
aVThe "fix," as it's called,
p318
aVmay be much more difficult for the dominant society
p319
aVthan, say, a $50 check
p320
aVor a church trip to paint some graffiti-covered houses,
p321
aVor a suburban family
p322
aVdonating a box of clothes they don't even want anymore.
p323
aVSo where does that leave us?
p324
aVShrugging our shoulders in the dark?
p325
aa(lp326
VThe United States continues on a daily basis to violate the terms
p327
aVof the 1851 and 1868 Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota.
p328
aVThe call to action I offer today \u2014
p329
aVmy TED wish \u2014 is this:
p330
aVHonor the treaties.
p331
aVGive back the Black Hills.
p332
aVIt's not your business what they do with them.
