VI'm speaking to you about what I call the "mesh."
p4
aVIt's essentially a fundamental shift
p5
aVin our relationship with stuff, with the things in our lives.
p6
aVAnd it's starting to look at \u2014
p7
aVnot always and not for everything \u2014
p8
aVbut in certain moments of time,
p9
aVaccess to certain kinds of goods and service
p10
aVwill trump ownership of them.
p11
aVAnd so it's the pursuit of better things,
p12
aVeasily shared.
p13
aVAnd we come from a long tradition of sharing.
p14
aVWe've shared transportation.
p15
aVWe've shared wine and food
p16
aVand other sorts of fabulous experiences
p17
aVin coffee bars in Amsterdam.
p18
aVWe've also shared other sorts of entertainment \u2014
p19
aVsports arenas, public parks,
p20
aVconcert halls, libraries,
p21
aVuniversities.
p22
aVAll these things are share-platforms,
p23
aVbut sharing ultimately starts and ends
p24
aVwith what I refer to
p25
aVas the "mother of all share-platforms."
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd as I think about the mesh
p28
aVand I think about, well, what's driving it,
p29
aVhow come it's happening now,
p30
aVI think there's a number of vectors
p31
aVthat I want to give you as background.
p32
aVOne is the recession \u2014
p33
aVthat the recession has caused us
p34
aVto rethink our relationship
p35
aVwith the things in our lives relative to the value \u2014
p36
aVso starting to align the value
p37
aVwith the true cost.
p38
aVSecondly, population growth
p39
aVand density into cities.
p40
aVMore people, smaller spaces,
p41
aVless stuff.
p42
aVClimate change:
p43
aVwe're trying to reduce the stress
p44
aVin our personal lives and in our communities
p45
aVand on the planet.
p46
aVAlso, there's been this recent distrust
p47
aVof big brands, global big brands,
p48
aVin a bunch of different industries,
p49
aVand that's created an opening.
p50
aVResearch is showing here, in the States,
p51
aVand in Canada and Western Europe,
p52
aVthat most of us are much more open
p53
aVto local companies,
p54
aVor brands that maybe we haven't heard of.
p55
aVWhereas before, we went with the big brands
p56
aVthat we were sure we trusted.
p57
aVAnd last is that
p58
aVwe're more connected now to more people on the planet
p59
aVthan ever before \u2014
p60
aVexcept for if you're sitting next to someone.
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VThe other thing that's worth considering
p65
aVis that we've made a huge investment
p66
aVover decades and decades,
p67
aVand tens of billions of dollars
p68
aVhave gone into this investment
p69
aVthat now is our inheritance.
p70
aVIt's a physical infrastructure
p71
aVthat allows us to get from point A to point B
p72
aVand move things that way.
p73
aVIt's also \u2014 Web and mobile
p74
aVallow us to be connected
p75
aVand create all kinds of platforms and systems,
p76
aVand the investment of those technologies
p77
aVand that infrastructure
p78
aVis really our inheritance.
p79
aVIt allows us to engage
p80
aVin really new and interesting ways.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd so for me, a mesh company, the "classic" mesh company,
p83
aVbrings together these three things:
p84
aVour ability to connect to each other \u2014
p85
aVmost of us are walking around with these mobile devices
p86
aVthat are GPS-enabled and Web-enabled \u2014
p87
aVallows us to find each other
p88
aVand find things in time and space.
p89
aVAnd third is that physical things
p90
aVare readable on a map \u2014
p91
aVso restaurants, a variety of venues,
p92
aVbut also with GPS and other technology
p93
aVlike RFID
p94
aVand it continues to expand beyond that,
p95
aVwe can also track things that are moving,
p96
aVlike a car, a taxicab, a transit system,
p97
aVa box that's moving through time and space.
p98
aVAnd so that sets up
p99
aVfor making access to get goods and services
p100
aVmore convenient and less costly in many cases
p101
aVthan owning them.
p102
aa(lp103
VFor example, I want to use Zipcar.
p104
aVHow many people here have experienced
p105
aVcar-sharing or bike-sharing?
p106
aVWow, that's great. Okay, thank you.
p107
aVBasically Zipcar
p108
aVis the largest car-sharing company in the world.
p109
aVThey did not invent car-sharing.
p110
aVCar-sharing was actually invented in Europe.
p111
aVOne of the founders went to Switzerland,
p112
aVsaw it implemented someplace,
p113
aVsaid, "Wow, that looks really cool.
p114
aVI think we can do that in Cambridge,"
p115
aVbrought it to Cambridge
p116
aVand they started \u2014 two women \u2014
p117
aVRobin Chase being the other person who started it.
p118
aVZipcar got some really important things right.
p119
aVFirst, they really understood
p120
aVthat a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir.
p121
aVAnd so they were very clever
p122
aVabout the way that they packaged car-sharing.
p123
aVThey made it sexy. They made it fresh.
p124
aVThey made it aspirational.
p125
aVIf you were a member of the club,
p126
aVwhen you're a member of a club, you're a Zipster.
p127
aVThe cars they picked didn't look like ex-cop cars
p128
aVthat were hollowed out or something.
p129
aVThey picked these sexy cars.
p130
aVThey targeted to universities.
p131
aVThey made sure that the demographic
p132
aVfor who they were targeting and the car was all matching.
p133
aVIt was a very nice experience,
p134
aVand the cars were clean and reliable, and it all worked.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd so from a branding perspective, they got a lot right.
p137
aVBut they understood fundamentally
p138
aVthat they are not a car company.
p139
aVThey understand that they are an information company.
p140
aVBecause when we buy a car
p141
aVwe go to the dealer once, we have an interaction, and we're chow \u2014
p142
aVusually as quickly as possible.
p143
aVBut when you're sharing a car and you have a car-share service,
p144
aVyou might use an E.V. to commute,
p145
aVyou get a truck because you're doing a home project.
p146
aVWhen you pick your aunt up at the airport, you get a sedan.
p147
aVAnd you're going to the mountains to ski,
p148
aVyou get different accessories put on the car
p149
aVfor doing that sort of thing.
p150
aVMeanwhile, these guys are sitting back,
p151
aVcollecting all sorts of data
p152
aVabout our behavior and how we interact with the service.
p153
aVAnd so it's not only an option for them,
p154
aVbut I believe it's an imperative
p155
aVfor Zipcar and other mesh companies
p156
aVto actually just wow us,
p157
aVto be like a concierge service.
p158
aVBecause we give them so much information,
p159
aVand they are entitled to really see
p160
aVhow it is that we're moving.
p161
aVThey're in really good shape to anticipate
p162
aVwhat we're going to want next.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd so what percent of the day
p165
aVdo you think the average person uses a car?
p166
aVWhat percentage of the time?
p167
aVAny guesses?
p168
aVThose are really very good.
p169
aVI was imagining it was like
p170
aV20 percent when I first started.
p171
aVThe number across the U.S. and Western Europe
p172
aVis eight percent.
p173
aVAnd so basically even if you think it's 10 percent,
p174
aV90 percent of the time,
p175
aVsomething that costs us a lot of money \u2014
p176
aVpersonally, and also we organize our cities around it
p177
aVand all sorts of things \u2014
p178
aV90 percent of the time it's sitting around.
p179
aVSo for this reason,
p180
aVI think one of the other themes with the mesh
p181
aVis essentially that, if we squeeze hard
p182
aVon things that we've thrown away,
p183
aVthere's a lot of value in those things.
p184
aVWhat set up with Zipcar \u2014 Zipcar started in 2000.
p185
aa(lp186
VIn the last year, 2010,
p187
aVtwo car companies started,
p188
aVone that's in the U.K. called WhipCar,
p189
aVand the other one, RelayRides, in the U.S.
p190
aVThey're both peer-to-peer car-sharing services,
p191
aVbecause the two things that really work for car-sharing
p192
aVis, one, the car has to be available,
p193
aVand two, it's within one or two blocks
p194
aVof where you stand.
p195
aVWell the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your office
p196
aVis probably your neighbor's car,
p197
aVand it's probably also available.
p198
aVSo people have created this business.
p199
aVZipcar started a decade earlier,
p200
aVin 2000.
p201
aVIt took them six years
p202
aVto get 1,000 cars in service.
p203
aVWhipCar, which started April of last year,
p204
aVit took them six months
p205
aVto get 1,000 cars in the service.
p206
aVSo, really interesting.
p207
aVPeople are making anywhere between
p208
aV200 and 700 dollars a month
p209
aVletting their neighbors use their car when they're not using it.
p210
aVSo it's like vacation rentals for cars.
p211
aVSince I'm here \u2014
p212
aVand I hope some people in the audience
p213
aVare in the car business \u2014
p214
aV(Laughter)
p215
aV\u2014 I'm thinking that, coming from the technology side of things \u2014
p216
aVwe saw cable-ready TVs
p217
aVand WiFi-ready Notebooks \u2014
p218
aVit would be really great if, any minute now,
p219
aVyou guys could start rolling share-ready cars off.
p220
aVBecause it just creates more flexibility.
p221
aVIt allows us as owners to have other options.
p222
aVAnd I think we're going there anyway.
p223
aa(lp224
VThe opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses \u2014
p225
aVand those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflix
p226
aVthat are full mesh businesses,
p227
aVor other ones where you have a lot of the car companies,
p228
aVcar manufacturers,
p229
aVwho are beginning to offer
p230
aVtheir own car-share services
p231
aVas well as a second flanker brand,
p232
aVor as really a test, I think \u2014
p233
aVis to make sharing irresistible.
p234
aVWe have experiences in our lives, certainly,
p235
aVwhen sharing has been irresistible.
p236
aVIt's just, how do we make that recurrent
p237
aVand scale it?
p238
aVWe know also, because we're connected in social networks,
p239
aVthat it's easy to create delight
p240
aVin one little place.
p241
aVIt's contagious because we're all connected to each other.
p242
aVSo if I have a terrific experience
p243
aVand I tweet it, or I tell five people standing next to me, news travels.
p244
aVThe opposite, as we know, is also true,
p245
aVoften more true.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo here we have LudoTruck, which is in L.A.,
p248
aVdoing the things that gourmet food trucks do,
p249
aVand they've gathered quite a following.
p250
aVIn general, and maybe, again, it's because I'm a tech entrepreneur,
p251
aVI look at things as platforms.
p252
aVPlatforms are invitations.
p253
aVSo creating Craigslist
p254
aVor iTunes and the iPhone developer network,
p255
aVthere are all these networks \u2014 Facebook as well.
p256
aVThese platforms invite all sorts of developers
p257
aVand all sorts of people
p258
aVto come with their ideas and their opportunity
p259
aVto create and target an application
p260
aVfor a particular audience.
p261
aVAnd honestly, it's full of surprises.
p262
aVBecause I don't think any of us in this room
p263
aVcould have predicted the sorts of applications
p264
aVthat have happened at Facebook, around Facebook,
p265
aVfor example, two years ago,
p266
aVwhen Mark announced
p267
aVthat they were going to go with a platform.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo in this way, I think that cities are platforms,
p270
aVand certainly Detroit is a platform.
p271
aVThe invitation of bringing
p272
aVmakers and artists and entrepreneurs \u2014
p273
aVit really helps stimulate this fiery creativity
p274
aVand helps a city to thrive.
p275
aVIt's inviting participation,
p276
aVand cities have, historically,
p277
aVinvited all sorts of participation.
p278
aVNow we're saying that there's other options as well.
p279
aVSo, for example, city departments
p280
aVcan open up transit data.
p281
aVGoogle has made available transit data API.
p282
aVAnd so there's about seven or eight cities already in the U.S.
p283
aVthat have provided the transit data,
p284
aVand different developers are building applications.
p285
aVSo I was having a coffee in Portland,
p286
aVand half-of-a-latte in
p287
aVand the little board in the cafe
p288
aVall of a sudden starts showing me
p289
aVthat the next bus is coming in three minutes
p290
aVand the train is coming in 16 minutes.
p291
aVAnd so it's reliable, real data
p292
aVthat's right in my face, where I am,
p293
aVso I can finish the latte.
p294
aa(lp295
VThere's this fabulous opportunity we have across the U.S. now:
p296
aVabout 21 percent
p297
aVof vacant commercial and industrial space.
p298
aVThat space is not vital.
p299
aVThe areas around it lack vitality
p300
aVand vibrancy and engagement.
p301
aVThere's this thing \u2014 how many people here
p302
aVhave heard of pop-up stores or pop-up shops?
p303
aVOh, great. So I'm a big fan of this.
p304
aVAnd this is a very mesh-y thing.
p305
aVEssentially, there are all sorts
p306
aVof restaurants in Oakland, near where I live.
p307
aVThere's a pop-up general store every three weeks,
p308
aVand they do a fantastic job
p309
aVof making a very social event
p310
aVhappening for foodies.
p311
aVSuper fun, and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood.
p312
aVSubsequent to that,
p313
aVafter it's been going for about a year now,
p314
aVthey actually started to lease and create and extend.
p315
aVAn area that was edgy-artsy
p316
aVis now starting to become much cooler
p317
aVand engage a lot more people.
p318
aVSo this is an example.
p319
aVThe Crafty Fox is this woman who's into crafts,
p320
aVand she does these pop-up crafts fairs around London.
p321
aVBut these sorts of things are happening
p322
aVin many different environments.
p323
aVFrom my perspective, one of the things pop-up stores do
p324
aVis create perishability and urgency.
p325
aVIt creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson:
p326
aVsold out.
p327
aVAnd the opportunity to really focus trust and attention
p328
aVis a wonderful thing.
p329
aa(lp330
VSo a lot of what we see in the mesh,
p331
aVand a lot of what we have in the platform that we built
p332
aVallows us to define, refine and scale.
p333
aVIt allows us to test things as an entrepreneur,
p334
aVto go to market,
p335
aVto be in conversation with people,
p336
aVlisten, refine something and go back.
p337
aVIt's very cost-effective,
p338
aVand it's very mesh-y.
p339
aVThe infrastructure enables that.
p340
aa(lp341
VIn closing, and as we're moving towards the end,
p342
aVI just also want to encourage \u2014
p343
aVand I'm willing to share my failures as well,
p344
aVthough not from the stage.
p345
aV(Laughter)
p346
aVI would just like to say that one of the big things,
p347
aVwhen we look at waste
p348
aVand when we look at ways that we can really be generous
p349
aVand contribute to each other,
p350
aVbut also move to create a better economic situation
p351
aVand a better environmental situation,
p352
aVis by sharing failures.
p353
aVAnd one quick example
p354
aVis Velib, in 2007,
p355
aVcame forward in Paris
p356
aVwith a very bold proposition,
p357
aVa very big bike-sharing service.
p358
aVThey made a lot of mistakes.
p359
aVThey had some number of big successes.
p360
aVBut they were very transparent, or they had to be,
p361
aVin the way that they exposed
p362
aVwhat worked and didn't work.
p363
aVAnd so B.C. in Barcelona
p364
aVand B-cycle
p365
aVand Boris Bikes in London \u2014
p366
aVno one has had to repeat
p367
aVthe version 1.0 screw-ups
p368
aVand expensive learning exercises
p369
aVthat happened in Paris.
p370
aVSo the opportunity when we're connected
p371
aVis also to share failures and successes.
p372
aa(lp373
VWe're at the very beginning of something
p374
aVthat, what we're seeing
p375
aVand the way that mesh companies are coming forward,
p376
aVis inviting, it's engaging, but it's very early.
p377
aVI have a website \u2014 it's a directory \u2014
p378
aVand it started with about 1,200 companies,
p379
aVand in the last two-and-a-half months
p380
aVit's up to about 3,300 companies.
p381
aVAnd it grows on a very regular daily basis.
p382
aVBut it's very much at the beginning.
p383
aa(lp384
VSo I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride.
p385
aVAnd thank you very much.
