VSo in college,
p4
aVI was a government major,
p5
aVwhich means I had to write a lot of papers.
p6
aVNow, when a normal student writes a paper,
p7
aVthey might spread the work out a little like this.
p8
aVSo, you know \u2014
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
Vyou get started maybe a little slowly,
p13
aVbut you get enough done in the first week
p14
aVthat, with some heavier days later on,
p15
aVeverything gets done, things stay civil.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd I would want to do that like that.
p20
aVThat would be the plan.
p21
aVI would have it all ready to go,
p22
aVbut then, actually, the paper would come along,
p23
aVand then I would kind of do this.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd that would happen every single paper.
p28
aa(lp29
VBut then came my 90-page senior thesis,
p30
aVa paper you're supposed to spend a year on.
p31
aVAnd I knew for a paper like that, my normal work flow was not an option.
p32
aVIt was way too big a project.
p33
aVSo I planned things out,
p34
aVand I decided I kind of had to go something like this.
p35
aVThis is how the year would go.
p36
aVSo I'd start off light,
p37
aVand I'd bump it up in the middle months,
p38
aVand then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear
p39
aVjust like a little staircase.
p40
aVHow hard could it be to walk up the stairs?
p41
aVNo big deal, right?
p42
aa(lp43
VBut then, the funniest thing happened.
p44
aVThose first few months?
p45
aVThey came and went,
p46
aVand I couldn't quite do stuff.
p47
aVSo we had an awesome new revised plan.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd then \u2014
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VBut then those middle months actually went by,
p56
aVand I didn't really write words,
p57
aVand so we were here.
p58
aVAnd then two months turned into one month,
p59
aVwhich turned into two weeks.
p60
aVAnd one day I woke up
p61
aVwith three days until the deadline,
p62
aVstill not having written a word,
p63
aVand so I did the only thing I could:
p64
aVI wrote 90 pages over 72 hours,
p65
aVpulling not one but two all-nighters \u2014
p66
aVhumans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters \u2014
p67
aVsprinted across campus,
p68
aVdove in slow motion,
p69
aVand got it in just at the deadline.
p70
aa(lp71
VI thought that was the end of everything.
p72
aVBut a week later I get a call,
p73
aVand it's the school.
p74
aVAnd they say, "Is this Tim Urban?"
p75
aVAnd I say, "Yeah."
p76
aVAnd they say, "We need to talk about your thesis."
p77
aVAnd I say, "OK."
p78
aVAnd they say,
p79
aV"It's the best one we've ever seen."
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
V(Applause)
p84
aa(lp85
VThat did not happen.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
VIt was a very, very bad thesis.
p90
aa(lp91
V(Laughter)
p92
aa(lp93
VI just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought,
p94
aV"This guy is amazing!"
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
VNo, no, it was very, very bad.
p99
aVAnyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy.
p100
aVI write the blog Wait But Why.
p101
aVAnd a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.
p102
aVMy behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me,
p103
aVand I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world
p104
aVwhat goes on in the heads of procrastinators,
p105
aVand why we are the way we are.
p106
aVNow, I had a hypothesis
p107
aVthat the brains of procrastinators were actually different
p108
aVthan the brains of other people.
p109
aVAnd to test this, I found an MRI lab
p110
aVthat actually let me scan both my brain
p111
aVand the brain of a proven non-procrastinator,
p112
aVso I could compare them.
p113
aVI actually brought them here to show you today.
p114
aVI want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference.
p115
aVI know that if you're not a trained brain expert,
p116
aVit's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK?
p117
aVSo here's the brain of a non-procrastinator.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VNow ...
p122
aVhere's my brain.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VThere is a difference.
p127
aVBoth brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them,
p128
aVbut the procrastinator's brain
p129
aValso has an Instant Gratification Monkey.
p130
aVNow, what does this mean for the procrastinator?
p131
aVWell, it means everything's fine until this happens.
p132
aa(lp133
V[This is a perfect time to get some work done.] [Nope!]
p134
aa(lp135
VSo the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision
p136
aVto do something productive,
p137
aVbut the Monkey doesn't like that plan,
p138
aVso he actually takes the wheel,
p139
aVand he says, "Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page
p140
aVof the Nancy Kerrigan/ Tonya Harding scandal,
p141
aVbecause I just remembered that that happened.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VThen \u2014
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VThen we're going to go over to the fridge,
p150
aVto see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago.
p151
aVAfter that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral
p152
aVthat starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets
p153
aVand ends much, much later with us watching interviews
p154
aVwith Justin Bieber's mom.
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
V"All of that's going to take a while,
p159
aVso we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today.
p160
aVSorry!"
p161
aa(lp162
V(Sigh)
p163
aa(lp164
VNow, what is going on here?
p165
aVThe Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy
p166
aVyou want behind the wheel.
p167
aVHe lives entirely in the present moment.
p168
aVHe has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future,
p169
aVand he only cares about two things:
p170
aVeasy and fun.
p171
aa(lp172
VNow, in the animal world, that works fine.
p173
aVIf you're a dog
p174
aVand you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things,
p175
aVyou're a huge success!
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VAnd to the Monkey,
p180
aVhumans are just another animal species.
p181
aVYou have to keep well-slept, well-fed and propagating into the next generation,
p182
aVwhich in tribal times might have worked OK.
p183
aVBut, if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times.
p184
aVWe're in an advanced civilization, and the Monkey does not know what that is.
p185
aVWhich is why we have another guy in our brain,
p186
aVthe Rational Decision-Maker,
p187
aVwho gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do.
p188
aVWe can visualize the future.
p189
aVWe can see the big picture.
p190
aVWe can make long-term plans.
p191
aVAnd he wants to take all of that into account.
p192
aVAnd he wants to just have us do
p193
aVwhatever makes sense to be doing right now.
p194
aVNow, sometimes it makes sense
p195
aVto be doing things that are easy and fun,
p196
aVlike when you're having dinner or going to bed
p197
aVor enjoying well-earned leisure time.
p198
aVThat's why there's an overlap.
p199
aVSometimes they agree.
p200
aVBut other times, it makes much more sense
p201
aVto be doing things that are harder and less pleasant,
p202
aVfor the sake of the big picture.
p203
aVAnd that's when we have a conflict.
p204
aVAnd for the procrastinator,
p205
aVthat conflict tends to end a certain way every time,
p206
aVleaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone,
p207
aVan easy and fun place that's entirely out of the Makes Sense circle.
p208
aVI call it the Dark Playground.
p209
aa(lp210
V(Laughter)
p211
aa(lp212
VNow, the Dark Playground is a place
p213
aVthat all of you procrastinators out there know very well.
p214
aVIt's where leisure activities happen
p215
aVat times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening.
p216
aVThe fun you have in the Dark Playground
p217
aVisn't actually fun, because it's completely unearned,
p218
aVand the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred \u2014
p219
aVall of those good procrastinator feelings.
p220
aVAnd the question is, in this situation, with the Monkey behind the wheel,
p221
aVhow does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone,
p222
aVa less pleasant place, but where really important things happen?
p223
aa(lp224
VWell, turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel,
p225
aVsomeone who's always looking down on him and watching over him
p226
aVin his darkest moments \u2014
p227
aVsomeone called the Panic Monster.
p228
aa(lp229
V(Laughter)
p230
aa(lp231
VNow, the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time,
p232
aVbut he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close
p233
aVor there's danger of public embarrassment,
p234
aVa career disaster or some other scary consequence.
p235
aVAnd importantly, he's the only thing the Monkey is terrified of.
p236
aVNow, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently,
p237
aVbecause the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago
p238
aVand invited me to do a TED Talk.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VNow, of course, I said yes.
p243
aVIt's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past.
p244
aa(lp245
V(Laughter)
p246
aa(lp247
V(Applause)
p248
aVBut in the middle of all this excitement,
p249
aVthe Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind.
p250
aVHe was saying, "Are we clear on what we just accepted?
p251
aVDo we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future?
p252
aVWe need to sit down and work on this right now."
p253
aVAnd the Monkey said, "Totally agree, but let's just open Google Earth
p254
aVand zoom in to the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground,
p255
aVand scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country,
p256
aVso we can get a better feel for India."
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VSo that's what we did that day.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VAs six months turned into four and then two and then one,
p265
aVthe people of TED decided to release the speakers.
p266
aVAnd I opened up the website, and there was my face
p267
aVstaring right back at me.
p268
aVAnd guess who woke up?
p269
aa(lp270
V(Laughter)
p271
aa(lp272
VSo the Panic Monster starts losing his mind,
p273
aVand a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd the Monkey \u2014 remember, he's terrified of the Panic Monster \u2014
p278
aVboom, he's up the tree!
p279
aVAnd finally,
p280
aVfinally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel
p281
aVand I can start working on the talk.
p282
aa(lp283
VNow, the Panic Monster explains
p284
aVall kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior,
p285
aVlike how someone like me could spend two weeks
p286
aVunable to start the opening sentence of a paper,
p287
aVand then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic
p288
aVto stay up all night and write eight pages.
p289
aVAnd this entire situation, with the three characters \u2014
p290
aVthis is the procrastinator's system.
p291
aVIt's not pretty, but in the end, it works.
p292
aVThis is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago.
p293
aa(lp294
VWhen I did, I was amazed by the response.
p295
aVLiterally thousands of emails came in,
p296
aVfrom all different kinds of people from all over the world,
p297
aVdoing all different kinds of things.
p298
aVThese are people who were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers
p299
aVand lots and lots of PhD students.
p300
aa(lp301
V(Laughter)
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd they were all writing, saying the same thing:
p304
aV"I have this problem too."
p305
aVBut what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post
p306
aVand the heaviness of these emails.
p307
aVThese people were writing with intense frustration
p308
aVabout what procrastination had done to their lives,
p309
aVabout what this Monkey had done to them.
p310
aVAnd I thought about this, and I said,
p311
aVwell, if the procrastinator's system works, then what's going on?
p312
aVWhy are all of these people in such a dark place?
p313
aa(lp314
VWell, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination.
p315
aVEverything I've talked about today, the examples I've given,
p316
aVthey all have deadlines.
p317
aVAnd when there's deadlines,
p318
aVthe effects of procrastination are contained to the short term
p319
aVbecause the Panic Monster gets involved.
p320
aVBut there's a second kind of procrastination
p321
aVthat happens in situations when there is no deadline.
p322
aVSo if you wanted a career where you're a self-starter \u2014
p323
aVsomething in the arts, something entrepreneurial \u2014
p324
aVthere's no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing's happening,
p325
aVnot until you've gone out and done the hard work
p326
aVto get momentum, get things going.
p327
aVThere's also all kinds of important things outside of your career
p328
aVthat don't involve any deadlines,
p329
aVlike seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health,
p330
aVworking on your relationship
p331
aVor getting out of a relationship that isn't working.
p332
aa(lp333
VNow if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things
p334
aVis the Panic Monster, that's a problem,
p335
aVbecause in all of these non-deadline situations,
p336
aVthe Panic Monster doesn't show up.
p337
aVHe has nothing to wake up for,
p338
aVso the effects of procrastination, they're not contained;
p339
aVthey just extend outward forever.
p340
aVAnd it's this long-term kind of procrastination
p341
aVthat's much less visible and much less talked about
p342
aVthan the funnier, short-term deadline-based kind.
p343
aVIt's usually suffered quietly and privately.
p344
aVAnd it can be the source
p345
aVof a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and regrets.
p346
aVAnd I thought, that's why those people are emailing,
p347
aVand that's why they're in such a bad place.
p348
aVIt's not that they're cramming for some project.
p349
aVIt's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator,
p350
aVat times, in their own lives.
p351
aVThe frustration is not that they couldn't achieve their dreams;
p352
aVit's that they weren't even able to start chasing them.
p353
aa(lp354
VSo I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany \u2014
p355
aVthat I don't think non-procrastinators exist.
p356
aVThat's right \u2014 I think all of you are procrastinators.
p357
aVNow, you might not all be a mess,
p358
aVlike some of us,
p359
aa(lp360
V(Laughter)
p361
aa(lp362
Vand some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines,
p363
aVbut remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick
p364
aVis when the deadlines aren't there.
p365
aa(lp366
VNow, I want to show you one last thing.
p367
aVI call this a Life Calendar.
p368
aVThat's one box for every week of a 90-year life.
p369
aVThat's not that many boxes,
p370
aVespecially since we've already used a bunch of those.
p371
aVSo I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar.
p372
aVWe need to think about what we're really procrastinating on,
p373
aVbecause everyone is procrastinating on something in life.
p374
aVWe need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey.
p375
aVThat's a job for all of us.
p376
aVAnd because there's not that many boxes on there,
p377
aVit's a job that should probably start today.
p378
aa(lp379
VWell, maybe not today, but ...
p380
aa(lp381
V(Laughter)
p382
aa(lp383
VYou know.
p384
aVSometime soon.
p385
aa(lp386
VThank you.
