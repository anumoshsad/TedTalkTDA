VI think all of us have been interested, at one time or another,
p4
aVin the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed,
p5
aVsuch as the classic Maya in the Yucatan, the Easter Islanders,
p6
aVthe Anasazi, Fertile Crescent society, Angor Wat, Great Zimbabwe
p7
aVand so on. And within the last decade or two,
p8
aVarchaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems
p9
aVunderlying many of these past collapses.
p10
aVBut there were also plenty of places in the world
p11
aVwhere societies have been developing for thousands of years
p12
aVwithout any sign of a major collapse,
p13
aVsuch as Japan, Java, Tonga and Tikopea. So evidently, societies
p14
aVin some areas are more fragile than in other areas.
p15
aVHow can we understand what makes some societies more fragile
p16
aVthan other societies? The problem is obviously relevant
p17
aVto our situation today, because today as well, there are
p18
aVsome societies that have already collapsed, such as Somalia
p19
aVand Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. There are also
p20
aVsocieties today that may be close to collapse, such as Nepal, Indonesia and Columbia.
p21
aa(lp22
VWhat about ourselves?
p23
aVWhat is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid
p24
aVdeclining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have?
p25
aVObviously the answer to this question is not going
p26
aVto be a single factor. If anyone tells you that there is a single-factor
p27
aVexplanation for societal collapses, you know right away
p28
aVthat they're an idiot. This is a complex subject.
p29
aVBut how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject?
p30
aVIn analyzing societal collapses, I've arrived at a
p31
aVfive-point framework \u2014 a checklist of things that I go through
p32
aVto try and understand collapses. And I'll illustrate that five-point
p33
aVframework by the extinction of the Greenland Norse society.
p34
aVThis is a European society with literate records,
p35
aVso we know a good deal about the people and their motivation.
p36
aVIn AD 984 Vikings went out to Greenland, settled Greenland,
p37
aVand around 1450 they died out \u2014 the society collapsed,
p38
aVand every one of them ended up dead.
p39
aa(lp40
VWhy did they all end up dead? Well, in my five-point framework,
p41
aVthe first item on the framework is to look for human impacts
p42
aVon the environment: people inadvertently destroying the resource
p43
aVbase on which they depend. And in the case of the Viking Norse,
p44
aVthe Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation,
p45
aVwhich was a particular problem for them because
p46
aVthey required forests to make charcoal, to make iron.
p47
aVSo they ended up an Iron Age European society, virtually
p48
aVunable to make their own iron. A second item on my checklist is
p49
aVclimate change. Climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter.
p50
aVIn the case of the Vikings \u2014 in Greenland, the climate got colder
p51
aVin the late 1300s, and especially in the 1400s. But a cold climate
p52
aVisn't necessarily fatal, because the Inuit \u2014 the Eskimos inhabiting
p53
aVGreenland at the same time \u2014 did better, rather than worse,
p54
aVwith cold climates. So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well?
p55
aa(lp56
VThe third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring
p57
aVfriendly societies that may prop up a society. And if that
p58
aVfriendly support is pulled away, that may make a society
p59
aVmore likely to collapse. In the case of the Greenland Norse,
p60
aVthey had trade with the mother country \u2014 Norway \u2014
p61
aVand that trade dwindled: partly because Norway got weaker,
p62
aVpartly because of sea ice between Greenland and Norway.
p63
aa(lp64
VThe fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies.
p65
aVIn the case of Norse Greenland, the hostiles were the Inuit \u2014
p66
aVthe Eskimos sharing Greenland \u2014 with whom the Norse
p67
aVgot off to bad relationships. And we know that the Inuit
p68
aVkilled the Norse and, probably of greater importance,
p69
aVmay have blocked access to the outer fjords, on which
p70
aVthe Norse depended for seals at a critical time of the year.
p71
aa(lp72
VAnd then finally, the fifth item on my checklist is the political,
p73
aVeconomic, social and cultural factors in the society that make it
p74
aVmore or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its
p75
aVenvironmental problems. In the case of the Greenland Norse,
p76
aVcultural factors that made it difficult for them
p77
aVto solve their problems were: their commitments to a
p78
aVChristian society investing heavily in cathedrals; their being
p79
aVa competitive-ranked chiefly society; and their scorn for the Inuit,
p80
aVfrom whom they refused to learn. So that's how the five-part
p81
aVframework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the Greenland Norse.
p82
aa(lp83
VWhat about a society today?
p84
aVFor the past five years, I've been taking my wife and kids to
p85
aVSouthwestern Montana, where I worked as a teenager
p86
aVon the hay harvest. And Montana, at first sight, seems
p87
aVlike the most pristine environment in the United States.
p88
aVBut scratch the surface, and Montana suffers from serious problems.
p89
aVGoing through the same checklist: human environmental impacts?
p90
aVYes, acute in Montana. Toxic problems from mine waste
p91
aVhave caused damage of billions of dollars.
p92
aVProblems from weeds, weed control, cost Montana nearly
p93
aV200 million dollars a year. Montana has lost agricultural areas
p94
aVfrom salinization, problems of forest management,
p95
aVproblems of forest fires. Second item on my checklist:
p96
aVclimate change. Yes \u2014 the climate in Montana is getting warmer
p97
aVand drier, but Montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation
p98
aVfrom the snow pack, and as the snow is melting \u2014 for example,
p99
aVas the glaciers in Glacier National Park are disappearing \u2014
p100
aVthat's bad news for Montana irrigation agriculture.
p101
aa(lp102
VThird thing on my checklist: relations with friendlies
p103
aVthat can sustain the society. In Montana today, more than half of
p104
aVthe income of Montana is not earned within Montana,
p105
aVbut is derived from out of state: transfer payments from
p106
aVsocial security, investments and so on \u2014
p107
aVwhich makes Montana vulnerable to the rest of the United States.
p108
aa(lp109
VFourth: relations with hostiles. Montanans have the same problems
p110
aVas do all Americans, in being sensitive to problems
p111
aVcreated by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies,
p112
aVand terrorist attacks. And finally, last item on my checklist:
p113
aVquestion of how political, economic, social, cultural attitudes
p114
aVplay into this. Montanans have long-held values, which today
p115
aVseem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems.
p116
aVLong-held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture,
p117
aVand to no government regulation; values that worked well
p118
aVin the past, but they don't seem to be working well today.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo, I'm looking at these issues of collapses
p121
aVfor a lot of past societies and for many present societies.
p122
aVAre there any general conclusions that arise?
p123
aVIn a way, just like Tolstoy's statement about every unhappy marriage
p124
aVbeing different, every collapsed or endangered society is different \u2014
p125
aVthey all have different details. But nevertheless, there are certain
p126
aVcommon threads that emerge from these comparisons
p127
aVof past societies that did or did not collapse
p128
aVand threatened societies today. One interesting common thread
p129
aVhas to do with, in many cases, the rapidity of collapse
p130
aVafter a society reaches its peak. There are many societies
p131
aVthat don't wind down gradually, but they build up \u2014 get richer
p132
aVand more powerful \u2014 and then within a short time, within a few decades
p133
aVafter their peak, they collapse. For example,
p134
aVthe classic lowland Maya of the Yucatan began to collapse in the
p135
aVearly 800s \u2014 literally a few decades after the Maya were building
p136
aVtheir biggest monuments, and Maya population was greatest.
p137
aa(lp138
VOr again, the collapse of the Soviet Union took place
p139
aVwithin a couple of decades, maybe within a decade, of the time
p140
aVwhen the Soviet Union was at its greatest power.
p141
aVAn analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish.
p142
aVThese rapid collapses are especially likely where there's
p143
aVa mismatch between available resources and resource consumption,
p144
aVor a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential.
p145
aVIn a petri dish, bacteria grow. Say they double every generation,
p146
aVand five generations before the end the petri dish is 15/16ths empty,
p147
aVand then the next generation's 3/4ths empty, and the next generation
p148
aVhalf empty. Within one generation after the petri dish still
p149
aVbeing half empty, it is full. There's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed.
p150
aVSo, this is a frequent theme:
p151
aVsocieties collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power.
p152
aa(lp153
VWhat it means to put it mathematically is that, if you're concerned
p154
aVabout a society today, you should be looking not at the value
p155
aVof the mathematical function \u2014 the wealth itself \u2014 but you should
p156
aVbe looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives
p157
aVof the function. That's one general theme. A second general theme
p158
aVis that there are many, often subtle environmental factors that make
p159
aVsome societies more fragile than others. Many of those factors
p160
aVare not well understood. For example, why is it that in the Pacific,
p161
aVof those hundreds of Pacific islands, why did Easter Island end up as
p162
aVthe most devastating case of complete deforestation?
p163
aVIt turns out that there were about nine different environmental
p164
aVfactors \u2014 some, rather subtle ones \u2014 that were working against
p165
aVthe Easter Islanders, and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra,
p166
aVlatitude, rainfall. Perhaps the most subtle of them
p167
aVis that it turns out that a major input of nutrients
p168
aVwhich protects island environments in the Pacific is from
p169
aVthe fallout of continental dust from central Asia.
p170
aVEaster, of all Pacific islands, has the least input of dust
p171
aVfrom Asia restoring the fertility of its soils. But that's
p172
aVa factor that we didn't even appreciate until 1999.
p173
aa(lp174
VSo, some societies, for subtle environmental reasons,
p175
aVare more fragile than others. And then finally,
p176
aVanother generalization. I'm now teaching a course
p177
aVat UCLA, to UCLA undergraduates, on these collapses
p178
aVof societies. What really bugs my UCLA undergraduate students is,
p179
aVhow on earth did these societies not see what they were doing?
p180
aVHow could the Easter Islanders have deforested their environment?
p181
aVWhat did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree?
p182
aVDidn't they see what they were doing? How could societies
p183
aVnot perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time?
p184
aVAnd I would expect that, if our human civilization carries on,
p185
aVthen maybe in the next century people will be asking,
p186
aVwhy on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see
p187
aVthe obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action?
p188
aVIt seems incredible in the past. In the future, it'll seem
p189
aVincredible what we are doing today. And so I've been
p190
aVtrying to develop a hierarchical set of considerations
p191
aVabout why societies fail to solve their problems \u2014
p192
aVwhy they fail to perceive the problems or, if they perceive them,
p193
aVwhy they fail to tackle them. Or, if they tackle them,
p194
aVwhy do they fail to succeed in solving them?
p195
aa(lp196
VI'll just mention two generalizations in this area.
p197
aVOne blueprint for trouble, making collapse likely,
p198
aVis where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term
p199
aVinterest of the decision-making elites and the long-term
p200
aVinterest of the society as a whole, especially if the elites
p201
aVare able to insulate themselves from the consequences
p202
aVof their actions. Where what's good in the short run for the elite
p203
aVis bad for the society as a whole, there's a real risk of the elite
p204
aVdoing things that would bring the society down in the long run.
p205
aVFor example, among the Greenland Norse \u2014
p206
aVa competitive rank society \u2014 what the chiefs really wanted
p207
aVis more followers and more sheep and more resources
p208
aVto outcompete the neighboring chiefs. And that led the chiefs
p209
aVto do what's called flogging the land: overstocking the land,
p210
aVforcing tenant farmers into dependency. And that made
p211
aVthe chiefs powerful in the short run,
p212
aVbut led to the society's collapse in the long run.
p213
aa(lp214
VThose same issues of conflicts of interest are acute
p215
aVin the United States today. Especially because
p216
aVthe decision makers in the United States are frequently
p217
aVable to insulate themselves from consequences
p218
aVby living in gated compounds, by drinking bottled water
p219
aVand so on. And within the last couple of years,
p220
aVit's been obvious that the elite in the business world
p221
aVcorrectly perceive that they can advance
p222
aVtheir short-term interest by doing things that are
p223
aVgood for them but bad for society as a whole,
p224
aVsuch as draining a few billion dollars out of Enron
p225
aVand other businesses. They are quite correct
p226
aVthat these things are good for them in the short term,
p227
aValthough bad for society in the long term.
p228
aVSo, that's one general conclusion about why societies
p229
aVmake bad decisions: conflicts of interest.
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd the other generalization that I want to mention
p232
aVis that it's particularly hard for a society to make
p233
aVquote-unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving
p234
aVstrongly held values that are good in many circumstances
p235
aVbut are poor in other circumstances. For example,
p236
aVthe Greenland Norse, in this difficult environment,
p237
aVwere held together for four-and-a-half centuries
p238
aVby their shared commitment to religion,
p239
aVand by their strong social cohesion. But those two things \u2014
p240
aVcommitment to religion and strong social cohesion \u2014
p241
aValso made it difficult for them to change at the end
p242
aVand to learn from the Inuit. Or today \u2014 Australia.
p243
aVOne of the things that enabled Australia to survive
p244
aVin this remote outpost of European civilization
p245
aVfor 250 years has been their British identity.
p246
aVBut today, their commitment to a British identity
p247
aVis serving Australians poorly in their need to adapt
p248
aVto their situation in Asia. So it's particularly difficult
p249
aVto change course when the things that get you in trouble
p250
aVare the things that are also the source of your strength.
p251
aa(lp252
VWhat's going to be the outcome today?
p253
aVWell, all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs
p254
aVgoing on in the modern world, time bombs that have fuses
p255
aVof a few decades to \u2014 all of them, not more than 50 years,
p256
aVand any one of which can do us in; the time bombs of water,
p257
aVof soil, of climate change, invasive species,
p258
aVthe photosynthetic ceiling, population problems, toxics, etc., etc. \u2014
p259
aVlisting about 12 of them. And while these time bombs \u2014
p260
aVnone of them has a fuse beyond 50 years, and most of them
p261
aVhave fuses of a few decades \u2014 some of them, in some places,
p262
aVhave much shorter fuses. At the rate at which we're going now,
p263
aVthe Philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest
p264
aVwithin five years. And the Solomon Islands are only
p265
aVone year away from losing their loggable forest,
p266
aVwhich is their major export. And that's going to be spectacular
p267
aVfor the economy of the Solomons. People often ask me,
p268
aVJared, what's the most important thing that we need to do
p269
aVabout the world's environmental problems?
p270
aVAnd my answer is, the most important thing we need to do
p271
aVis to forget about there being any single thing that is
p272
aVthe most important thing we need to do.
p273
aVInstead, there are a dozen things, any one of which could do us in.
p274
aVAnd we've got to get them all right, because if we solve 11,
p275
aVwe fail to solve the 12th \u2014 we're in trouble. For example,
p276
aVif we solve our problems of water and soil and population,
p277
aVbut don't solve our problems of toxics, then we are in trouble.
p278
aa(lp279
VThe fact is that our present course is a non-sustainable course,
p280
aVwhich means, by definition, that it cannot be maintained.
p281
aVAnd the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades.
p282
aVThat means that those of us in this room who are less than
p283
aV50 or 60 years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved,
p284
aVand those of us who are over the age of 60 may not see
p285
aVthe resolution, but our children and grandchildren certainly will.
p286
aVThe resolution is going to achieve either of two forms:
p287
aVeither we will resolve these non-sustainable time-fuses
p288
aVin pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action,
p289
aVor else these conflicts are going to get settled
p290
aVin unpleasant ways not of our choice \u2014 namely, by war,
p291
aVdisease or starvation. But what's for sure is that our
p292
aVnon-sustainable course will get resolved in one way or another
p293
aVin a few decades. In other words, since the theme of this session
p294
aVis choices, we have a choice. Does that mean that we should
p295
aVget pessimistic and overwhelmed? I draw the reverse conclusion.
p296
aa(lp297
VThe big problems facing the world today are not at all
p298
aVthings beyond our control. Our biggest threat is not an asteroid
p299
aVabout to crash into us, something we can do nothing about.
p300
aVInstead, all the major threats facing us today are problems
p301
aVentirely of our own making. And since we made the problems,
p302
aVwe can also solve the problems. That then means that it's
p303
aVentirely in our power to deal with these problems.
p304
aVIn particular, what can all of us do? For those of you
p305
aVwho are interested in these choices, there are lots of things
p306
aVyou can do. There's a lot that we don't understand,
p307
aVand that we need to understand. And there's a lot that
p308
aVwe already do understand, but aren't doing, and that
p309
aVwe need to be doing. Thank you.
