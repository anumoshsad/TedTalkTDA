VFor the last 20 years I've been designing puzzles.
p4
aVAnd I'm here today to give you
p5
aVa little tour, starting from the very first puzzle I designed,
p6
aVthrough what I'm doing now.
p7
aVI've designed puzzles for books, printed things.
p8
aVI'm the puzzle columnist for Discover Magazine.
p9
aVI've been doing that for about 10 years.
p10
aVI have a monthly puzzle calendar.
p11
aVI do toys. The bulk of my work is in computer games.
p12
aVI did puzzles for "Bejeweled."
p13
aV(Applause)
p14
aVI didn't invent "Bejeweled." I can't take credit for that.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo, very first puzzle,
p17
aVsixth grade, my teacher said,
p18
aV"Oh, let's see, that guy, he likes to make stuff.
p19
aVI'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper
p20
aVfor the board."
p21
aVI thought this was a great assignment.
p22
aVAnd so here is what I came up with. I start fiddling with it.
p23
aVI came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet
p24
aVthat's been folded just once.
p25
aVThe question is, which letter is it if I unfold it?
p26
aVOne hint: It's not "L."
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aVIt could be an "L," of course.
p29
aVSo, what else could it be?
p30
aVYeah, a lot of you got it.
p31
aVOh yeah. So, clever thing.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, that was my first puzzle. I got hooked.
p34
aVI created something new, I was very excited
p35
aVbecause, you know, I'd made crossword puzzles,
p36
aVbut that's sort of like filling in somebody else's matrix.
p37
aVThis was something really original. I got hooked.
p38
aVI read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American.
p39
aVWent on, and eventually decided to devote myself, full time, to that.
p40
aa(lp41
VNow, I should pause and say, what do I mean by puzzle?
p42
aVA puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve
p43
aVand has a right answer.
p44
aV"Fun to solve," as opposed to everyday problems,
p45
aVwhich, frankly, are not very well-designed puzzles.
p46
aVYou know, they might have a solution.
p47
aVIt might take a long time. Nobody wrote down the rules clearly.
p48
aVWho designed this?
p49
aVIt's like, you know, life is not a very well-written story
p50
aVso we have to hire writers to make movies.
p51
aa(lp52
VWell, I take everyday problems, and I make puzzles out of them.
p53
aVAnd "right answer," of course there might be more than one right answer;
p54
aVmany puzzles have more than one.
p55
aVBut as opposed to a couple other forms of play,
p56
aVtoys and games \u2014
p57
aVby toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal.
p58
aVYou can create one out of Legos.
p59
aVYou know, you can do anything you want.
p60
aVOr competitive games like chess where,
p61
aVwell, you're not trying to solve ... You can make a chess puzzle,
p62
aVbut the goal really is to beat another player.
p63
aa(lp64
VI consider that puzzles are an art form.
p65
aVThey're very ancient. It goes back as long as there is written history.
p66
aVIt's a very small form, like a joke,
p67
aVa poem, a magic trick or a song, very compact form.
p68
aVAt worst, they're throwaways, they're for amusement.
p69
aVBut at best they can reach for something more
p70
aVand create a memorable impression.
p71
aVThe progression of my career that you'll see
p72
aVis looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo, one thing I found early on, when I started doing computer games,
p75
aVis that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception.
p76
aVI'll show you how. Here is a famous one.
p77
aVSo, it's two profiles in black, or a white vase in the middle.
p78
aVThis is called a figure-ground illusion.
p79
aVThe artist M.C. Escher exploited that
p80
aVin some of his wonderful prints.
p81
aVHere we have "Day and Night."
p82
aVHere is what I did with figure and ground.
p83
aVSo, here we have "figure" in black.
p84
aVHere we have "figure" in white.
p85
aVAnd it's all part of the same design.
p86
aVThe background to one is the other.
p87
aVOriginally I tried to do the words "figure" and "ground."
p88
aVBut I couldn't do that, I realized. I changed the problem.
p89
aVIt's all "figure."
p90
aV(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VA few other things. Here is my name.
p93
aVAnd that turns into the title of my first book, "Inversions."
p94
aVThese sorts of designs now go by the word "ambigram."
p95
aVI'll show you just a couple others. Here we have
p96
aVthe numbers one through 10, the digits zero through nine, actually.
p97
aVEach letter here is one of these digits.
p98
aVNot strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense.
p99
aVI like pushing on what an ambigram can mean.
p100
aa(lp101
VHere's the word "mirror." No, it's not the same upside-down.
p102
aVIt's the same this way.
p103
aVAnd a marvelous fellow from the Media Lab
p104
aVwho just got appointed head of RISD, is John Maeda.
p105
aVAnd so I did this for him. It's sort of a visual canon.
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVAnd recently in Magic magazine
p108
aVI've done a number of ambigrams on magician's names.
p109
aVSo here we have Penn and Teller, same upside-down.
p110
aVThis appears in my puzzle calendar.
p111
aVOkay, let's go back to the slides.
p112
aVThank you very much.
p113
aa(lp114
VNow, those are fun to look at.
p115
aVNow how would you do it interactively?
p116
aVFor a while I was an interface designer.
p117
aVAnd so I think a lot about interaction.
p118
aVWell, let's first of all simplify the vases illusion,
p119
aVmake the thing on the right.
p120
aVNow, if you could pick up the black vase,
p121
aVit would look like the figure on top.
p122
aVIf you could pick up the white area,
p123
aVit would look like the figure on the bottom.
p124
aVWell, you can't do that physically,
p125
aVbut on a computer you can do it. Let's switch over to the P.C.
p126
aa(lp127
VAnd here it is, figure-ground.
p128
aVThe goal here is to take the pieces on the left
p129
aVand make them so they look like the shape on the right.
p130
aVAnd this follows the rules I just said:
p131
aVany black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up.
p132
aVBut that is also true of any white area.
p133
aVSo, here we got the white area in the middle,
p134
aVand you can pick it up.
p135
aVI'll just go one step further.
p136
aVSo, here is \u2014
p137
aVhere is a couple pieces. Move them together,
p138
aVand now this is an active piece.
p139
aVYou can really get inside somebody's perception
p140
aVand have them experience something.
p141
aVIt's like the old maxim of
p142
aV"you can tell somebody something
p143
aVand show them, but if they do it they really learn it."
p144
aa(lp145
VHere is another thing you can do.
p146
aVThere is a game called Rush Hour.
p147
aVThis is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design
p148
aVbesides Rubik's cube.
p149
aVSo, here we have a crowded parking lot
p150
aVwith cars all over the place.
p151
aVThe goal is to get the red car out. It's a sliding block puzzle.
p152
aVIt's made by the company Think Fun.
p153
aVIt's done very well. I love this puzzle.
p154
aa(lp155
VWell, let's play one. Here. So, here is a very simple puzzle.
p156
aVWell, that's too simple, let's add another piece.
p157
aVOkay, so how would you solve this one?
p158
aVWell, move the blue one out of the way.
p159
aVHere, let's make it a little harder. Still pretty easy.
p160
aVNow we'll make it harder, a little harder.
p161
aVNow, this one is a little bit trickier.
p162
aVYou know? What do you do here?
p163
aVThe first move is going to be what?
p164
aVYou're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right.
p165
aVAnd you can make puzzles like this one that aren't solvable at all.
p166
aVThose four are locked in a pinwheel; you can't get them apart.
p167
aa(lp168
VI wanted to make a sequel.
p169
aVI didn't come up with the original idea. But this is another way
p170
aVI work as an inventor is to create a sequel.
p171
aVI came up with this. This is Railroad Rush Hour.
p172
aVIt's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece,
p173
aVa square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically.
p174
aVIn the other game the cars can only move forward and back.
p175
aVCreated a whole bunch of levels for it.
p176
aVNow I'm making it available to schools.
p177
aVAnd it includes exercises that show you
p178
aVnot just how to solve these puzzles,
p179
aVbut how to extract the principles that will let you solve
p180
aVmathematical puzzles or problems in science, other areas.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo, I'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles
p183
aVas well as just me creating them.
p184
aVGarry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist.
p185
aVYou know, he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon.
p186
aVIn Discover Magazine, I'm an investigative puzzle maker.
p187
aVI got interested in gene sequencing.
p188
aVAnd I said, "Well, how on Earth can you come up with a sequence
p189
aVof the base pairs in DNA?"
p190
aVCut up the DNA, you sequence individual pieces,
p191
aVand then you look for overlaps,
p192
aVand you basically match them at the edges. And I said,
p193
aV"This is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, except the pieces overlap."
p194
aa(lp195
VSo, here is what I created for Discover Magazine.
p196
aVAnd it has to be solvable in a magazine.
p197
aVYou know, you can't cut out the pieces and move them around.
p198
aVSo, here is the nine pieces. And you're supposed to put them into this grid.
p199
aVAnd you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge.
p200
aVThere is only one solution. It's not that hard.
p201
aVBut it takes some persistence.
p202
aVAnd when you're done, it makes this design,
p203
aVwhich, if you squint, is the word "helix."
p204
aVSo, that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content,
p205
aVrather than the other way around.
p206
aa(lp207
VHere is a couple more. Here is a physics-based puzzle.
p208
aVWhich way will these fall?
p209
aVOne of these weighs 50 pounds, 30 pounds and 10 pounds.
p210
aVAnd depending on which one weighs which amount,
p211
aVthey'll fall different directions.
p212
aVAnd here is a puzzle based on color mixing.
p213
aVI separated this image into cyan, magenta, yellow, black,
p214
aVthe basic printing colors, and then mixed up the separations,
p215
aVand you get these peculiar pictures.
p216
aVWhich separations were mixed up to make those pictures?
p217
aVGets you thinking about color.
p218
aa(lp219
VFinally, what I'm doing now. So, ShuffleBrain.com,
p220
aVwebsite you can go visit, I joined up with my wife, Amy-Jo Kim.
p221
aVShe could easily be up here giving a talk about her work.
p222
aVSo, we're making smart games for social media.
p223
aVI'll explain what that means. We're looking at three trends.
p224
aVThis is what's going on in the games industry right now.
p225
aVFirst of all, you know, for a long time
p226
aVcomputer games meant things like "Doom,"
p227
aVwhere you're going around shooting things, very violent games, very fast,
p228
aVaimed at teenage boys. Right? That's who plays computer games.
p229
aa(lp230
VWell, guess what? That's changing.
p231
aV"Bejeweled" is a big hit. It was the game that really broke open
p232
aVwhat's called casual games.
p233
aVAnd the main players are over 35, and are female.
p234
aVThen recently "Rock Band" has been a big hit.
p235
aVAnd it's a game you play with other people.
p236
aVIt's very physical. It looks nothing like a traditional game.
p237
aVThis is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming.
p238
aa(lp239
VNow, within that there is some interesting things happening.
p240
aVThere is also a trend towards games that are good for you.
p241
aVWhy? Well, we aging Boomers,
p242
aVBaby Boomers, we're eating our healthy food,
p243
aVwe're exercising. What about our minds?
p244
aVOh no, our parents are getting Alzheimer's. We better do something.
p245
aVTurns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of Alzheimer's.
p246
aVSo, we got games like "Brain Age" coming out for the Nintendo DS, huge hit.
p247
aVA lot of people do Sudoku. In fact some doctors prescribe it.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd then there is social media, and what's happening on the Internet.
p250
aVEverybody now considers themselves a creator,
p251
aVand not just a viewer.
p252
aVAnd what does this add up to?
p253
aVHere is what we see coming.
p254
aVIt's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle.
p255
aVThey're part of your life. They're not necessarily a separate thing.
p256
aVAnd they are both, something that is good for you, and they're fun.
p257
aVI'm a puzzle guy. My wife is an expert in social media.
p258
aVAnd we decided to combine our skills.
p259
aa(lp260
VOur first game is called "Photo Grab." The game takes about a minute and 20 seconds.
p261
aVThis is your first time playing my game. Okay.
p262
aVLet's see how well we can do. There are three images.
p263
aVAnd we have 24 seconds each.
p264
aVWhere is that?
p265
aVI'll play as fast as I can.
p266
aVBut if you can see it, shout out the answer.
p267
aVYou get more \u2014 Down, okay, yeah where is that?
p268
aVOh, yeah. There, okay. J-O and \u2014
p269
aVI guess that's that part. We got the bow. That bow helps.
p270
aVThat's his hair. You get a lot of figure-ground problems.
p271
aVYeah, that one is easy. Okay. So, ahhh! Okay on to the next one.
p272
aVOkay, so that's the lens.
p273
aVAnybody?
p274
aVLooks like a black shape. So, where is that?
p275
aVThat's the corner of the whole thing.
p276
aVYeah, I've played this image before,
p277
aVbut even when I make up my own puzzles \u2014
p278
aVand you can put your own images in here.
p279
aVAnd we have people all over the world doing that now.
p280
aa(lp281
VThere we are. Visit ShuffleBrain.com
p282
aVif you want to try it yourself. Thank you.
