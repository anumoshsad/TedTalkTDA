VNamaste. Good morning.
p4
aVI'm very happy to be here in India.
p5
aVAnd I've been thinking a lot about what I have learned
p6
aVover these last particularly 11 years
p7
aVwith V-Day and "The Vagina Monologues,"
p8
aVtraveling the world,
p9
aVessentially meeting with women and girls across the planet
p10
aVto stop violence against women.
p11
aa(lp12
VWhat I want to talk about today
p13
aVis this particular cell,
p14
aVor grouping of cells, that is in each and every one of us.
p15
aVAnd I want to call it the girl cell.
p16
aVAnd it's in men as well as in women.
p17
aVI want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells
p18
aVis central to the evolution of our species
p19
aVand the continuation of the human race.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd I want you imagine that at some point in history
p22
aVa group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world
p23
aVunderstood that the suppression of this particular cell,
p24
aVthe oppression of these cells,
p25
aVthe reinterpretation of these cells,
p26
aVthe undermining of these cells,
p27
aVgetting us to believe in the weakness of these cells
p28
aVand the crushing, eradicating, destroying,
p29
aVreducing these cells,
p30
aVbasically began the process of killing off the girl cell,
p31
aVwhich was, by the way, patriarchy.
p32
aa(lp33
VI want you to imagine that the girl is a chip
p34
aVin the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness.
p35
aVAnd it is essential to balance, to wisdom
p36
aVand to actually the future of all of us.
p37
aVAnd then I want you to imagine that this girl cell
p38
aVis compassion,
p39
aVand it's empathy, and it's passion itself,
p40
aVand it's vulnerability,
p41
aVand it's openness, and it's intensity,
p42
aVand it's association, and it's relationship,
p43
aVand it is intuitive.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd then let's think how compassion informs wisdom,
p46
aVand that vulnerability is our greatest strength,
p47
aVand that emotions have inherent logic,
p48
aVwhich lead to radical, appropriate, saving action.
p49
aVAnd then let's remember that we've been taught
p50
aVthe exact opposite by the powers that be,
p51
aVthat compassion clouds your thinking,
p52
aVthat it gets in the way,
p53
aVthat vulnerability is weakness,
p54
aVthat emotions are not to be trusted,
p55
aVand you're not supposed to take things personally,
p56
aVwhich is one of my favorites.
p57
aa(lp58
VI think the whole world has essentially
p59
aVbeen brought up not to be a girl.
p60
aVHow do we bring up boys? What does it mean to be a boy?
p61
aVTo be a boy really means not to be a girl.
p62
aVTo be a man means not to be a girl.
p63
aVTo be a woman means not to be a girl.
p64
aVTo be strong means not to be a girl.
p65
aVTo be a leader means not to be a girl.
p66
aVI actually think that
p67
aVbeing a girl is so powerful
p68
aVthat we've had to train everyone not to be that.
p69
aV(Laughter)
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd I'd also like to say that the irony
p72
aVof course, is that denying girl,
p73
aVsuppressing girl, suppressing emotion,
p74
aVrefusing feeling has lead thus here.
p75
aVWhere we have now come to live in a world where
p76
aVthe most extreme forms of violence,
p77
aVthe most horrific poverty,
p78
aVgenocide, mass rapes,
p79
aVthe destruction of the Earth, is completely out of control.
p80
aVAnd because we have suppressed our girl cells
p81
aVand suppressed our girl-ship,
p82
aVwe do not feel what is going on.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo, we are not being charged with
p85
aVthe adequate response to what is happening.
p86
aVI want to talk a little bit about
p87
aVthe Democratic Republic of Congo.
p88
aVFor me, it was the turning point of my life.
p89
aVI have spent a lot of time there in the last three years.
p90
aVI feel up to that point I had seen a lot in the world,
p91
aVa lot of violence.
p92
aa(lp93
VI essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last 12 years.
p94
aVBut the Democratic Republic of Congo
p95
aVreally was the turning point in my soul.
p96
aVI went and I spent time
p97
aVin a place called Bukavu
p98
aVin a hospital called the Panzi Hospital,
p99
aVwith a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person I've ever met.
p100
aVHis name is Dr. Denis Mukwege.
p101
aVIn the Congo, for those of you who don't know,
p102
aVthere has been a war raging for the last 12 years,
p103
aVa war that has killed nearly six million people.
p104
aVIt is estimated that somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 women
p105
aVhave been raped there.
p106
aa(lp107
VWhen I spent my first weeks at Panzi hospital
p108
aVI sat with women
p109
aVwho sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories.
p110
aVTheir stories were so horrific,
p111
aVand so mind-blowing and so on the other side of human existence,
p112
aVthat to be perfectly honest with you, I was shattered.
p113
aVAnd I will tell you that what happened
p114
aVis through that shattering,
p115
aVlistening to the stories of eight-year-old girls who had their insides eviscerated,
p116
aVwho had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them
p117
aVso they had holes, literally, inside them
p118
aVwhere their pee and poop came out of them.
p119
aa(lp120
VListening to the story of 80-year-old women
p121
aVwho were tied to chains and circled,
p122
aVand where groups of men would come and rape them periodically,
p123
aVall in the name of economic exploitation
p124
aVto steal the minerals so the West can have it and profit from them.
p125
aVMy mind was so shattered.
p126
aa(lp127
VBut what happened for me is that that shattering
p128
aVactually emboldened me
p129
aVin a way I have never been emboldened.
p130
aVThat shattering, that opening of my girl cell,
p131
aVthat kind of massive breakthrough of my heart
p132
aVallowed me to become more courageous, and braver,
p133
aVand actually more clever
p134
aVthan I had been in the past in my life.
p135
aa(lp136
VI want to say that I think the powers that be
p137
aVknow that empire-building
p138
aVis actually \u2014 that feelings get in the way of empire-building.
p139
aVFeelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the Earth,
p140
aVand excavating the Earth, and destroying things.
p141
aVI remember, for example, when my father,
p142
aVwho was very, very violent, used to beat me.
p143
aVAnd he would actually say, while he was beating me,
p144
aV"Don't you cry. Don't you dare cry."
p145
aVBecause my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him.
p146
aVAnd even in the moment he didn't want to be reminded
p147
aVof what he was doing.
p148
aa(lp149
VI know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell.
p150
aVAnd I want to say we've annihilated it in men as well as in women.
p151
aVAnd I think in some ways
p152
aVwe've been much harsher to men
p153
aVin the annihilation of their girl cell.
p154
aV(Applause)
p155
aVI see how boys have been brought up, and I see this across the planet:
p156
aVto be tough, to be hardened,
p157
aVto distance themselves from their tenderness, to not cry.
p158
aVI actually realized once in Kosovo,
p159
aVwhen I watched a man break down,
p160
aVthat bullets are actually hardened tears,
p161
aVthat when we don't allow men to have their girl self
p162
aVand have their vulnerability, and have their compassion,
p163
aVand have their hearts, that they become hardened and hurtful
p164
aVand violent.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd I think we have taught men to be secure
p167
aVwhen they are insecure,
p168
aVto pretend they know things when they don't know things,
p169
aVor why would we be where we are?
p170
aVTo pretend they're not a mess when they are a mess.
p171
aVAnd I will tell you a very funny story.
p172
aVOn my way here on the airplane, I was walking up and down the aisle of the plane.
p173
aVAnd all these men, literally at least 10 men,
p174
aVwere in their little seats watching chick flicks.
p175
aVAnd they were all alone, and I thought, "This is the secret life of men."
p176
aV(Laughter)
p177
aa(lp178
VI've traveled, as I said,
p179
aVto many, many countries,
p180
aVand I've seen, if we do what we do to the girl inside us
p181
aVthen obviously it's horrific to think
p182
aVwhat we do to girls in the world.
p183
aVAnd we heard from Sunitha yesterday,
p184
aVand Kavita about what we do to girls.
p185
aVBut I just want to say that
p186
aVI've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns,
p187
aVwho are literally being treated like ashtrays.
p188
aVI've seen girls be treated like garbage cans.
p189
aVI've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers
p190
aVand brothers and fathers and uncles.
p191
aVI've seen girls starving themselves to death in America
p192
aVin institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves.
p193
aa(lp194
VI've seen that we cut girls and we control them
p195
aVand we keep them illiterate,
p196
aVor we make them feel bad about being too smart.
p197
aVWe silence them. We make them feel guilty
p198
aVfor being smart. We get them to behave,
p199
aVto tone it down, not to be too intense.
p200
aVWe sell them, we kill them as embryos,
p201
aVwe enslave them, we rape them.
p202
aVWe are so accustomed to robbing girls
p203
aVof the subject of being the subjects of their lives
p204
aVthat we have now actually objectified them
p205
aVand turned them into commodities.
p206
aa(lp207
VThe selling of girls is rampant across the planet.
p208
aVAnd in many places they are worth less than goats and cows.
p209
aVBut I also want to talk about the fact that
p210
aVif one in eight people on the planet
p211
aVare girls between the ages of 10 to 24,
p212
aVthey are they key, really, in the developing world,
p213
aVas well as in the whole world, to the future of humanity.
p214
aVAnd if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages
p215
aVthat keep them where society wants them to be,
p216
aVincluding lack of access to healthcare,
p217
aVeducation, healthy foods,
p218
aVlabor force participation.
p219
aVThe burden of all the household tasks
p220
aVusually falls on girls and younger siblings,
p221
aVwhich ensures that they will never overcome these barriers.
p222
aa(lp223
VThe state of girls, the condition of girls,
p224
aVwill, in my belief \u2014 and that's the girl inside us
p225
aVand the girl in the world \u2014 determine whether
p226
aVthe species survives.
p227
aVAnd what I want to suggest is that,
p228
aVhaving talked to girls, because I just finished a new book called
p229
aV"I Am an Emotional Creature: The Secret Life of Girls Around the World,"
p230
aVI've been talking to girls for five years,
p231
aVand one of the things that I've seen is true everywhere
p232
aVis that the verb that's been enforced on girl
p233
aVis the verb "to please."
p234
aVGirls are trained to please.
p235
aVI want to change the verb.
p236
aVI want us all to change the verb.
p237
aVI want the verb to be "educate,"
p238
aVor "activate," or "engage,"
p239
aVor "confront," or "defy," or "create."
p240
aVIf we teach girls to change the verb
p241
aVwe will actually enforce the girl inside us
p242
aVand the girl inside them.
p243
aa(lp244
VAnd I have to now share a few stories
p245
aVof girls I've seen across the planet
p246
aVwho have engaged their girl,
p247
aVwho have taken on their girl in spite of
p248
aVall the circumstances around them.
p249
aVI know a 14-year-old girl in the Netherlands,
p250
aVfor example, who is demanding that she take a boat
p251
aVand go around the entire world by herself.
p252
aa(lp253
VThere is a teenage girl who just recently
p254
aVwent out and knew that she needed 56 stars
p255
aVtattooed on the right side of her face.
p256
aa(lp257
VThere is a girl, Julia Butterfly Hill,
p258
aVwho lived for a year in a tree
p259
aVbecause she wanted to protect the wild oaks.
p260
aa(lp261
VThere is a girl who I met 14 years ago in Afghanistan
p262
aVwho I have adopted as my daughter
p263
aVbecause her mother was killed. Her mother was a revolutionary.
p264
aVAnd this girl, when she was 17 years old,
p265
aVwore a burqa in Afghanistan,
p266
aVand went into the stadiums
p267
aVand documented the atrocities that were going on towards women,
p268
aVunderneath her burqa, with a video.
p269
aVAnd that video became the video that went out all over the world
p270
aVafter 9/11 to show what was going on in Afghanistan.
p271
aa(lp272
VI want to talk about Rachel Corrie
p273
aVwho was in her teens when she stood in front of an Israeli tank
p274
aVto say, "End the occupation."
p275
aVAnd she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down
p276
aVand rolled over by that tank.
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd I want to talk about a girl that I just met recently
p279
aVin Bukavu, who was impregnated by her rapist.
p280
aVAnd she was holding her baby.
p281
aVAnd I asked her if she loved her baby.
p282
aVAnd she looked into her baby's eyes and she said,
p283
aV"Of course I love my baby. How could I not love my baby?
p284
aVIt's my baby and it's full of love."
p285
aa(lp286
VThe capacity for girls to overcome situations
p287
aVand to move on levels, to me, is mind-blowing.
p288
aVThere is a girl named Dorcas, and I just met her in Kenya.
p289
aVDorcas is 15 years old,
p290
aVand she was trained in self-defense.
p291
aVA few months ago she was picked up on the street
p292
aVby three older men.
p293
aVThey kidnapped her, they put her in a car.
p294
aVAnd through her self-defense, she grabbed their Adam's apples,
p295
aVshe punched them in the eyes
p296
aVand she got herself free and out of the car.
p297
aa(lp298
VIn Kenya, in August,
p299
aVI went to visit one of the V-Day safe houses for girls,
p300
aVa house we opened seven years ago
p301
aVwith an amazing woman named Agnes Pareyio.
p302
aVAgnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl,
p303
aVshe was female genitally mutilated.
p304
aVAnd she made a decision as many women do across this planet,
p305
aVthat what was done to her would not be enforced and done
p306
aVto other women and girls.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo, for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley.
p309
aVShe taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like,
p310
aVand what a mutilated vagina looked like.
p311
aVAnd in that time she saved many girls. And when we met her
p312
aVwe asked her what we could do for her,
p313
aVand she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster."
p314
aVSo, we got her a Jeep. And then she saved 4,500 girls.
p315
aa(lp316
VAnd then we asked her, "Okay, what else do you need?"
p317
aVAnd she said, "Well, now, I need a house."
p318
aVSo, seven years ago Agnes built the first V-Day safe house
p319
aVin Narok, Kenya, in the Masai land.
p320
aVAnd it was a house where girls could run away,
p321
aVthey could save their clitoris, they wouldn't be cut,
p322
aVthey could go to school.
p323
aVAnd in the years that Agnes has had the house,
p324
aVshe has changed the situation there.
p325
aVShe has literally become deputy mayor.
p326
aVShe's changed the rules.
p327
aVThe whole community has bought in to what she's doing.
p328
aa(lp329
VWhen we were there she was doing a ritual
p330
aVwhere she reconciles girls, who have run away, with their families.
p331
aVAnd there was a young girl named Jaclyn.
p332
aVJaclyn was 14 years old and she was in her Masai family
p333
aVand there's a drought in Kenya.
p334
aVSo cows are dying, and cows are the most
p335
aVvalued possession.
p336
aVAnd Jaclyn overheard her father
p337
aVtalking to an old man about
p338
aVhow he was about to sell her for the cows.
p339
aVAnd she knew that meant she would be cut.
p340
aVShe knew that meant she wouldn't go to school.
p341
aVShe knew that meant she wouldn't have a future.
p342
aVShe knew she would have to marry that old man, and she was 14.
p343
aa(lp344
VSo, one afternoon, she'd heard about the safe house,
p345
aVJaclyn left her father's house
p346
aVand she walked for two days, two days
p347
aVthrough Masai land.
p348
aVShe slept with the hyenas. She hid at night.
p349
aVShe imagined her father killing her on one hand,
p350
aVand Mama Agnes greeting her,
p351
aVwith the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house.
p352
aVAnd when she got to the house she was greeted.
p353
aVAgnes took her in, and Agnes loved her,
p354
aVand Agnes supported her for the year.
p355
aVShe went to school and she found her voice,
p356
aVand she found her identity, and she found her heart.
p357
aa(lp358
VThen, her time was ready
p359
aVwhen she had to go back to talk to her father
p360
aVabout the reconciliation, after a year.
p361
aVI had the privilege of being in the hut
p362
aVwhen she was reunited with her father and reconciled.
p363
aVIn that hut, we walked in,
p364
aVand her father and his four wives were sitting there,
p365
aVand her sisters who had just returned because
p366
aVthey had all fled when she had fled,
p367
aVand her primary mother, who had been beaten
p368
aVin standing up for her with the elders.
p369
aVWhen her father saw her and saw who she had become,
p370
aVin her full girl self,
p371
aVhe threw his arms around her and broke down crying.
p372
aVHe said, "You are beautiful. You have grown into a gorgeous woman.
p373
aVWe will not cut you.
p374
aVAnd I give you my word, here and now,
p375
aVthat we will not cut your sisters either."
p376
aa(lp377
VAnd what she said to him was,
p378
aV"You were willing to sell me for four cows,
p379
aVand a calf and some blankets.
p380
aVBut I promise you, now that I will be educated
p381
aVI will always take care of you,
p382
aVand I will come back and I will build you a house.
p383
aVAnd I will be in your corner for the rest of your life."
p384
aa(lp385
VFor me, that is the power of girls.
p386
aVAnd that is the power of transformation.
p387
aVI want to close today
p388
aVwith a new piece from my book.
p389
aVAnd I want to do it tonight
p390
aVfor the girl in everybody here.
p391
aVAnd I want to do it for Sunitha.
p392
aVAnd I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday,
p393
aVthe girls who survive, the girls who can become somebody else.
p394
aVBut I really want to do it for each and every person here,
p395
aVto value the girl in us,
p396
aVto value the part that cries,
p397
aVto value the part that's emotional,
p398
aVto value the part that's vulnerable,
p399
aVto understand that's where the future lies.
p400
aa(lp401
VThis is called "I'm An Emotional Creature."
p402
aVAnd it happened because I met a girl in Watts, L.A.
p403
aVI was asking girls if they like being a girl,
p404
aVand all the girls were like, "No, I hate it. I can't stand it.
p405
aVIt's all bad. My brothers get everything."
p406
aVAnd this girl just sat up and went, "I love being a girl.
p407
aVI'm an emotional creature!"
p408
aV(Laughter)
p409
aVThis is for her:
p410
aa(lp411
VI love being a girl.
p412
aVI can feel what you're feeling
p413
aVas you're feeling inside the feeling before.
p414
aVI am an emotional creature.
p415
aVThings do not come to me as intellectual theories
p416
aVor hard-pressed ideas.
p417
aVThey pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears.
p418
aVOh, I know when your girlfriend's really pissed off,
p419
aVeven though she appears to give you what you want.
p420
aVI know when a storm is coming.
p421
aVI can feel the invisible stirrings in the air.
p422
aVI can tell you he won't call back. It's a vibe I share.
p423
aa(lp424
VI am an emotional creature.
p425
aVI love that I do not take things lightly.
p426
aVEverything is intense to me,
p427
aVthe way I walk in the street, the way my momma wakes me up,
p428
aVthe way it's unbearable when I lose, the way I hear bad news.
p429
aa(lp430
VI am an emotional creature.
p431
aVI am connected to everything and everyone. I was born like that.
p432
aVDon't you say all negative
p433
aVthat it's only only a teenage thing,
p434
aVor it's only because I'm a girl.
p435
aVThese feelings make me better.
p436
aVThey make me present. They make me ready. They make me strong.
p437
aa(lp438
VI am an emotional creature.
p439
aVThere is a particular way of knowing.
p440
aVIt's like the older women somehow forgot.
p441
aVI rejoice that it's still in my body.
p442
aVOh, I know when the coconut's about to fall.
p443
aVI know we have pushed the Earth too far.
p444
aVI know my father isn't coming back,
p445
aVand that no one's prepared for the fire.
p446
aVI know that lipstick means more than show,
p447
aVand boys are super insecure,
p448
