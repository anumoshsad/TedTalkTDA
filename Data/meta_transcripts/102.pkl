VSo I'm going to speak about a problem that I have
p4
aVand that's that I'm a philosopher.
p5
aa(lp6
V(Laughter)
p7
aa(lp8
VWhen I go to a party and people ask me what do I do
p9
aVand I say, "I'm a professor," their eyes glaze over.
p10
aVWhen I go to an academic cocktail party
p11
aVand there are all the professors around, they ask me what field I'm in
p12
aVand I say, "philosophy" \u2014 their eyes glaze over.
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VWhen I go to a philosopher's party
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
Vand they ask me what I work on and I say, "consciousness,"
p21
aVtheir eyes don't glaze over \u2014 their lips curl into a snarl.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls
p26
aVbecause they think, "That's impossible! You can't explain consciousness."
p27
aVThe very chutzpah of somebody thinking
p28
aVthat you could explain consciousness is just out of the question.
p29
aa(lp30
VMy late, lamented friend Bob Nozick, a fine philosopher,
p31
aVin one of his books, "Philosophical Explanations,"
p32
aVis commenting on the ethos of philosophy \u2014
p33
aVthe way philosophers go about their business.
p34
aVAnd he says, you know, "Philosophers love rational argument."
p35
aVAnd he says, "It seems as if the ideal argument
p36
aVfor most philosophers is you give your audience the premises
p37
aVand then you give them the inferences and the conclusion,
p38
aVand if they don't accept the conclusion, they die.
p39
aVTheir heads explode." The idea is to have an argument
p40
aVthat is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents.
p41
aVBut in fact that doesn't change people's minds at all.
p42
aa(lp43
VIt's very hard to change people's minds
p44
aVabout something like consciousness,
p45
aVand I finally figured out the reason for that.
p46
aVThe reason for that is that everybody's an expert on consciousness.
p47
aVWe heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games.
p48
aVThey all have an idea for a video game, even if they're not experts.
p49
aVBut they don't consider themselves experts on video games;
p50
aVthey've just got strong opinions.
p51
aVI'm sure that people here who work on, say, climate change
p52
aVand global warming, or on the future of the Internet,
p53
aVencounter people who have very strong opinions
p54
aVabout what's going to happen next.
p55
aVBut they probably don't think of these opinions as expertise.
p56
aVThey're just strongly held opinions.
p57
aVBut with regard to consciousness, people seem to think,
p58
aVeach of us seems to think, "I am an expert.
p59
aVSimply by being conscious, I know all about this."
p60
aVAnd so, you tell them your theory and they say,
p61
aV"No, no, that's not the way consciousness is!
p62
aVNo, you've got it all wrong."
p63
aVAnd they say this with an amazing confidence.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd so what I'm going to try to do today
p66
aVis to shake your confidence. Because I know the feeling \u2014
p67
aVI can feel it myself.
p68
aVI want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds \u2014
p69
aVthat you are, yourselves, authoritative about your own consciousness.
p70
aVThat's the order of the day here.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow, this nice picture shows a thought-balloon, a thought-bubble.
p73
aVI think everybody understands what that means.
p74
aVThat's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness.
p75
aVThis is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done.
p76
aVIt's a Saul Steinberg of course \u2014 it was a New Yorker cover.
p77
aVAnd this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque.
p78
aVThat reminds him of the word baroque, barrack, bark, poodle,
p79
aVSuzanne R. \u2014 he's off to the races.
p80
aVThere's a wonderful stream of consciousness here
p81
aVand if you follow it along, you learn a lot about this man.
p82
aVWhat I particularly like about this picture, too,
p83
aVis that Steinberg has rendered the guy
p84
aVin this sort of pointillist style.
p85
aa(lp86
VWhich reminds us, as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday:
p87
aVwhat we are, what each of us is \u2014 what you are, what I am \u2014
p88
aVis approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots.
p89
aVThat's what we're made of.
p90
aVNo other ingredients at all. We're just made of cells, about 100 trillion of them.
p91
aVNot a single one of those cells is conscious;
p92
aVnot a single one of those cells knows who you are, or cares.
p93
aVSomehow, we have to explain
p94
aVhow when you put together teams, armies, battalions
p95
aVof hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells \u2014
p96
aVnot so different really from a bacterium, each one of them \u2014
p97
aVthe result is this. I mean, just look at it.
p98
aVThe content \u2014 there's color, there's ideas, there's memories,
p99
aVthere's history. And somehow all that content of consciousness
p100
aVis accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons.
p101
aVHow is that possible? Many people just think it isn't possible at all.
p102
aVThey think, "No, there can't be any
p103
aVsort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness."
p104
aa(lp105
VThis is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel,
p106
aVwho's a professor of religion, actually, at the University of Hawaii,
p107
aVand he's an expert magician, and an expert
p108
aVon the street magic of India, which is what this book is about,
p109
aV"Net of Magic."
p110
aVAnd there's a passage in it which I would love to share with you.
p111
aVIt speaks so eloquently to the problem.
p112
aV"'I'm writing a book on magic,' I explain, and I'm asked, 'Real magic?'
p113
aVBy 'real magic,' people mean miracles,
p114
aVthaumaturgical acts, and supernatural powers.
p115
aV'No,' I answer. 'Conjuring tricks, not real magic.'
p116
aV'Real magic,' in other words, refers to the magic that is not real;
p117
aVwhile the magic that is real, that can actually be done, is not real magic."
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VNow, that's the way a lot of people feel about consciousness.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VReal consciousness is not a bag of tricks.
p126
aVIf you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks,
p127
aVthen it's not real consciousness, whatever it is.
p128
aVAnd, as Marvin said, and as other people have said,
p129
aV"Consciousness is a bag of tricks."
p130
aVThis means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied
p131
aVand incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness.
p132
aVSo this is the problem. So I have to
p133
aVdo a little bit of the sort of work
p134
aVthat a lot of you won't like,
p135
aVfor the same reason that you don't like to see
p136
aVa magic trick explained to you.
p137
aVHow many of you here, if somebody \u2014 some smart aleck \u2014
p138
aVstarts telling you how a particular magic trick is done,
p139
aVyou sort of want to block your ears and say, "No, no, I don't want to know!
p140
aVDon't take the thrill of it away. I'd rather be mystified.
p141
aVDon't tell me the answer."
p142
aVA lot of people feel that way about consciousness, I've discovered.
p143
aVAnd I'm sorry if I impose some clarity, some understanding on you.
p144
aVYou'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks.
p145
aa(lp146
VBut I'm not going to explain it all to you.
p147
aVI'm going to do what philosophers do.
p148
aVHere's how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick.
p149
aVYou know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick?
p150
aVThe philosopher says, "I'm going to explain to you how that's done.
p151
aVYou see, the magician doesn't really saw the lady in half."
p152
aa(lp153
V(Laughter)
p154
aa(lp155
V"He merely makes you think that he does."
p156
aVAnd you say, "Yes, and how does he do that?"
p157
aVHe says, "Oh, that's not my department, I'm sorry."
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VSo now I'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness.
p162
aVBut I'm going to try to also show you
p163
aVthat consciousness isn't quite as marvelous \u2014
p164
aVyour own consciousness isn't quite as wonderful \u2014
p165
aVas you may have thought it is.
p166
aVThis is something, by the way, that Lee Siegel talks about in his book.
p167
aVHe marvels at how he'll do a magic show, and afterwards
p168
aVpeople will swear they saw him do X, Y, and Z. He never did those things.
p169
aVHe didn't even try to do those things.
p170
aVPeople's memories inflate what they think they saw.
p171
aVAnd the same is true of consciousness.
p172
aa(lp173
VNow, let's see if this will work. All right. Let's just watch this.
p174
aVWatch it carefully.
p175
aVI'm working with a young computer-animator documentarian
p176
aVnamed Nick Deamer, and this is a little demo that he's done for me,
p177
aVpart of a larger project some of you may be interested in.
p178
aVWe're looking for a backer.
p179
aVIt's a feature-length documentary on consciousness.
p180
aVOK, now, you all saw what changed, right?
p181
aVHow many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color?
p182
aVEvery one. I'll just show you by running it again.
p183
aVEven when you know that they're all going to change color,
p184
aVit's very hard to notice. You have to really concentrate
p185
aVto pick up any of the changes at all.
p186
aa(lp187
VNow, this is an example \u2014 one of many \u2014
p188
aVof a phenomenon that's now being studied quite a bit.
p189
aVIt's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my
p190
aV1991 book, "Consciousness Explained,"
p191
aVwhere I said if you did experiments of this sort,
p192
aVyou'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes.
p193
aVIf there's time at the end,
p194
aVI'll show you the much more dramatic case.
p195
aVNow, how can it be that there are all those changes going on,
p196
aVand that we're not aware of them?
p197
aVWell, earlier today, Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades,
p198
aVthe way your eye moves around three or four times a second.
p199
aVHe didn't mention the speed. Your eye is constantly in motion,
p200
aVmoving around, looking at eyes, noses, elbows,
p201
aVlooking at interesting things in the world.
p202
aVAnd where your eye isn't looking,
p203
aVyou're remarkably impoverished in your vision.
p204
aVThat's because the foveal part of your eye,
p205
aVwhich is the high-resolution part,
p206
aVis only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length.
p207
aVThat's the detail part.
p208
aVIt doesn't seem that way, does it?
p209
aVIt doesn't seem that way, but that's the way it is.
p210
aVYou're getting in a lot less information than you think.
p211
aa(lp212
VHere's a completely different effect. This is a painting by Bellotto.
p213
aVIt's in the museum in North Carolina.
p214
aVBellotto was a student of Canaletto's.
p215
aVAnd I love paintings like that \u2014
p216
aVthe painting is actually about as big as it is right here.
p217
aVAnd I love Canalettos, because Canaletto has this fantastic detail,
p218
aVand you can get right up
p219
aVand see all the details on the painting.
p220
aVAnd I started across the hall in North Carolina,
p221
aVbecause I thought it was probably a Canaletto,
p222
aVand would have all that in detail.
p223
aVAnd I noticed that on the bridge there, there's a lot of people \u2014
p224
aVyou can just barely see them walking across the bridge.
p225
aVAnd I thought as I got closer
p226
aVI would be able to see all the detail of most people,
p227
aVsee their clothes, and so forth.
p228
aVAnd as I got closer and closer, I actually screamed.
p229
aVI yelled out because when I got closer,
p230
aVI found the detail wasn't there at all.
p231
aVThere were just little artfully placed blobs of paint.
p232
aVAnd as I walked towards the picture,
p233
aVI was expecting detail that wasn't there.
p234
aVThe artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes
p235
aVand wagons and all sorts of things,
p236
aVand my brain had taken the suggestion.
p237
aa(lp238
VYou're familiar with a more recent technology, which is \u2014 There,
p239
aVyou can get a better view of the blobs.
p240
aVSee, when you get close
p241
aVthey're really just blobs of paint.
p242
aVYou will have seen something like this \u2014 this is the reverse effect.
p243
aVI'll just give that to you one more time.
p244
aa(lp245
VNow, what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion?
p246
aVWhen an artful blob of paint or two, by an artist,
p247
aVsuggests a person \u2014 say, one of
p248
aVMarvin Minsky's little society of mind \u2014
p249
aVdo they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere?
p250
aVI don't think so. Not a chance. But then, how on Earth is it done?
p251
aVWell, remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady?
p252
aVIt's the same thing.
p253
aVThe brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there.
p254
aVYou think the detail's there, but it isn't there.
p255
aVThe brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all.
p256
aVIt's just making you expect the detail.
p257
aa(lp258
VLet's just do this experiment very quickly.
p259
aVIs the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right, rotated?
p260
aVYes.
p261
aVHow many of you did it by rotating the one on the left
p262
aVin your mind's eye, to see if it matched up with the one on the right?
p263
aVHow many of you rotated the one on the right? OK.
p264
aVHow do you know that's what you did?
p265
aa(lp266
V(Laughter)
p267
aa(lp268
VThere's in fact been a very interesting debate
p269
aVraging for over 20 years in cognitive science \u2014
p270
aVvarious experiments started by Roger Shepherd,
p271
aVwho measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images.
p272
aVYes, it's possible to do that.
p273
aVBut the details of the process are still in significant controversy.
p274
aVAnd if you read that literature, one of the things
p275
aVthat you really have to come to terms with is
p276
aVeven when you're the subject in the experiment, you don't know.
p277
aVYou don't know how you do it.
p278
aVYou just know that you have certain beliefs.
p279
aVAnd they come in a certain order, at a certain time.
p280
aVAnd what explains the fact that that's what you think?
p281
aVWell, that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician.
p282
aa(lp283
VThis is a figure that I love: Bradley, Petrie, and Dumais.
p284
aVYou may think that I've cheated,
p285
aVthat I've put a little whiter-than-white boundary there.
p286
aVHow many of you see that sort of boundary,
p287
aVwith the Necker cube floating in front of the circles?
p288
aVCan you see it?
p289
aVWell, you know, in effect, the boundary's really there, in a certain sense.
p290
aVYour brain is actually computing that boundary,
p291
aVthe boundary that goes right there.
p292
aVBut now, notice there are two ways of seeing the cube, right?
p293
aVIt's a Necker cube.
p294
aVEverybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube? OK.
p295
aVCan you see the four ways of seeing the cube?
p296
aVBecause there's another way of seeing it.
p297
aVIf you're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles,
p298
aVsome black circles, there's another way of seeing it.
p299
aVAs a cube, on a black background,
p300
aVas seen through a piece of Swiss cheese.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
VCan you get it? How many of you can't get it? That'll help.
p305
aa(lp306
V(Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VNow you can get it. These are two very different phenomena.
p309
aVWhen you see the cube one way, behind the screen,
p310
aVthose boundaries go away.
p311
aVBut there's still a sort of filling in, as we can tell if we look at this.
p312
aVWe don't have any trouble seeing the cube, but where does the color change?
p313
aVDoes your brain have to send little painters in there?
p314
aVThe purple-painters and the green-painters
p315
aVfight over who's going to paint that bit behind the curtain? No.
p316
aVYour brain just lets it go. The brain doesn't need to fill that in.
p317
aVWhen I first started talking about
p318
aVthe Bradley, Petrie, Dumais example that you just saw \u2014
p319
aVI'll go back to it, this one \u2014
p320
aVI said that there was no filling-in behind there.
p321
aVAnd I supposed that that was just a flat truth, always true.
p322
aVBut Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn't.
p323
aa(lp324
VNow, if you think you see some pale yellow \u2014
p325
aVI'll run this a few more times.
p326
aVLook in the gray areas,
p327
aVand see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there \u2014
p328
aVyeah, it's amazing. There's nothing there. It's no trick.
p329
aV["Failure to Detect Changes in Scenes" slide]
p330
aVThis is Ron Rensink's work, which was in some degree
p331
aVinspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book.
p332
aVLet me just pause this for a second if I can.
p333
aa(lp334
VThis is change-blindness.
p335
aVWhat you're going to see is two pictures,
p336
aVone of which is slightly different from the other.
p337
aVYou see here the red roof and the gray roof,
p338
aVand in between them there will be a mask,
p339
aVwhich is just a blank screen, for about a quarter of a second.
p340
aVSo you'll see the first picture, then a mask,
p341
aVthen the second picture, then a mask.
p342
aVAnd this will just continue, and your job as the subject
p343
aVis to press the button when you see the change.
p344
aVSo, show the original picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank.
p345
aVShow the next picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank.
p346
aVAnd keep going, until the subject presses the button, saying,
p347
aV"I see the change."
p348
aa(lp349
VSo now we're going to be subjects in the experiment.
p350
aVWe're going to start easy. Some examples.
p351
aVNo trouble there.
p352
aVCan everybody see? All right.
p353
aVIndeed, Rensink's subjects took only a little bit more
p354
aVthan a second to press the button.
p355
aVCan you see that one?
p356
aV2.9 seconds.
p357
aVHow many don't see it still?
p358
aVWhat's on the roof of that barn?
p359
aa(lp360
V(Laughter)
p361
aa(lp362
VIt's easy.
p363
aVIs it a bridge or a dock?
p364
aVThere are a few more really dramatic ones, and then I'll close.
p365
aVI want you to see a few that are particularly striking.
p366
aVThis one because it's so large and yet it's pretty hard to see.
p367
aVCan you see it?
p368
aa(lp369
VAudience: Yes.
p370
aa(lp371
VDan Dennett: See the shadows going back and forth? Pretty big.
p372
aVSo 15.5 seconds is the median time
p373
aVfor subjects in his experiment there.
p374
aa(lp375
VI love this one. I'll end with this one,
p376
aVjust because it's such an obvious and important thing.
p377
aVHow many still don't see it? How many still don't see it?
p378
aVHow many engines on the wing of that Boeing?
p379
aa(lp380
V(Laughter)
p381
aa(lp382
VRight in the middle of the picture!
p383
aVThanks very much for your attention.
p384
aVWhat I wanted to show you is that scientists,
p385
aVusing their from-the-outside, third-person methods,
p386
aVcan tell you things about your own consciousness
p387
aVthat you would never dream of,
p388
aVand that, in fact, you're not the authority
p389
aVon your own consciousness that you think you are.
p390
aVAnd we're really making a lot of progress
p391
aVon coming up with a theory of mind.
p392
aa(lp393
VJeff Hawkins, this morning, was describing his attempt
p394
aVto get theory, and a good, big theory, into the neuroscience.
p395
aVAnd he's right. This is a problem.
p396
aVHarvard Medical School once \u2014 I was at a talk \u2014
p397
aVdirector of the lab said, "In our lab, we have a saying.
p398
aVIf you work on one neuron, that's neuroscience.
p399
aVIf you work on two neurons, that's psychology."
p400
aa(lp401
V(Laughter)
p402
aa(lp403
VWe have to have more theory, and it can come as much from the top down.
p404
aa(lp405
