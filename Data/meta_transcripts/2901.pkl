VA long time ago,
p4
aVI was a professional animator.

VAnd at night,
p15
aVI would make my own experimental films.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Music)
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd I was spending a lot of time, way too much time, in front of a screen
p20
aVfor work that would be presented on a screen,
p21
aVand I had this great need to get my hands back on the work again.
p22
aa(lp23
VNow, before "The Simpsons,"
p24
aVbefore "Gumby,"
p25
aVbefore "Betty Boop,"
p26
aVbefore there was such a thing as cinema and television,
p27
aVanimation was hugely popular in this form.
p28
aVThis is a zoetrope.
p29
aVAnd you spin this drum,
p30
aVand you look through the slits into the inside of the drum,
p31
aVand you see the animation pop to life.
p32
aVThis is animation in physical form,
p33
aVand it's animation I could get my hands on again.
p34
aa(lp35
VI took these ideas to Denmark.
p36
aVI went there with my family on a Fulbright Fellowship.
p37
aVThat's my daughter, Mia.
p38
aVI rode around the city on my bicycle
p39
aVand shot all the interesting moving elements of Copenhagen:
p40
aVthe boaters in the canals,
p41
aVthe colors that explode in spring,
p42
aVthe free-use city bikes,
p43
aVlove,
p44
aVtextures,
p45
aVthe healthy cuisine \u2014
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd I brought all that video back into the physical world
p50
aVby printing it out on these long strips of ink-jet paper
p51
aVand cutting out the forms.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, I invented my own form of the zoetrope,
p54
aVwhich removes the drum
p55
aVand replaces the slits with a video camera.
p56
aVAnd this was very exciting for me,
p57
aVbecause it meant that I could make these physical objects,
p58
aVand I could make films from those objects.
p59
aVThat's me riding on my bicycle.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
VI made about 25 paper sculptures,
p64
aVeach the size of a bicycle wheel.
p65
aVI brought them into the studio,
p66
aVspun them
p67
aVand shot them to make the film "Copenhagen Cycles."
p68
aa(lp69
V(Music)
p70
aa(lp71
VThis project not only allowed me to get my hands back on the work again
p72
aVbut it helped me get my life back.
p73
aVInstead of spending 12, 15 hours a day with my face plastered to a screen,
p74
aVI was having these little adventures with our new family
p75
aVand shooting video along the way,
p76
aVand it was kind of a symbiosis of art and life.
p77
aVAnd I think that it's no mistake
p78
aVthat zoetrope translates into "wheel of life."
p79
aa(lp80
V(Music)
p81
aa(lp82
VBut film and video does flatten sculpture,
p83
aVso I tried to imagine
p84
aVa way that animated sculpture could be experienced as such,
p85
aVand also a completely immersive kind of animated sculpture.
p86
aVAnd that's where I came up with the idea for the zoetrope tunnel.
p87
aVYou walk through with a handheld strobe,
p88
aVand wherever you point the flashlight,
p89
aVthe animation pops to life.
p90
aVI plan to finish this project in the next 30 to 40 years.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VBut I did build a half-scale prototype.
p95
aVIt's covered in Velcro,
p96
aVand I could lay inside on this bridge
p97
aVand stick animated sequences to the walls
p98
aVand test stuff out.
p99
aVPeople would comment that it reminded them of an MRI.
p100
aVAnd that medical connection spoke to me,
p101
aVbecause at the age of 14,
p102
aVI was diagnosed with a degenerative retinal condition
p103
aVthat's slowly taking my vision away,
p104
aVand I'd never responded to that in my work.
p105
aVSo I responded to it in this piece called, "Implant."
p106
aVIt is an imaginary, super-magnified medical device
p107
aVthat fits around the optic nerve.
p108
aVAnd the public is, in a sense, miniaturized to experience it.
p109
aVWith a handheld strobe,
p110
aVthey can explore the sculpture,
p111
aVand discover thousands of cell-sized robots
p112
aVhard at work, leaping in and out of the optic nerve,
p113
aVbeing deployed to the retina
p114
aVto repair it.
p115
aVIt's my science fiction fantasy cure of my own incurable disorder.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Machine buzzes)
p118
aa(lp119
VNow, in the real-world gene therapy and gene therapy research,
p120
aVhealthy genes are being administered to unhealthy cells using viruses.
p121
aVThere's a lot of colorful, fluffy hope in this,
p122
aVand there's also some creepy, threatening idea
p123
aVof viruses maybe becoming an invasive species in your body.
p124
aa(lp125
VVision loss has helped to take me away from the things
p126
aVthat disconnect me from the world.
p127
aVInstead of being sealed off in an automobile,
p128
aVI ride my bike,
p129
aVtake buses and trains
p130
aVand walk a lot.
p131
aVAnd instead of a visually intensive process in the studio, primarily,
p132
aVI'm also getting outdoors a lot more
p133
aVand using more of my senses.
p134
aa(lp135
VThis landscape is a couple hours east of San Diego, California.
p136
aVMy brother lives out that way.
p137
aVHe and I went camping there for four days.
p138
aVAnd I grabbed my camera,
p139
aVand I walked through the canyons.
p140
aVAnd I tried to imagine and figure out
p141
aVwhat kind of motion would be present
p142
aVin this place that was so still and so devoid of motion.
p143
aVI think it's the stillest place I've ever been.
p144
aVAnd I realized that it was the movement of my own body through the landscape
p145
aVthat was creating the animation.
p146
aVIt was the motion of changing perspective.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo I created this piece called "Mud Caves" from those photographs.
p149
aVIt's a multilayered print piece,
p150
aVand you can think of it as a zoetrope laid flat.
p151
aVIt's kind of my western landscape panorama.
p152
aVAnd next to the print piece there's a video monitor
p153
aVthat shows the animation hidden within the artwork.
p154
aVI think one of the best parts about this project for me
p155
aVwas that I got to hang out with my brother a lot,
p156
aVwho lives 2,500 miles away from me.
p157
aVAnd we would just sit in this seemingly eternal landscape
p158
aVsculpted by water over millions of years
p159
aVand talk.
p160
aVWe'd talk about our kids growing up
p161
aVand the slowing pace of our parents,
p162
aVand our dad who's suffering from leukemia, memory loss and infection.
p163
aVAnd it struck me that, as individuals,
p164
aVwe're finite,
p165
aVbut as a family,
p166
aVwe are an ongoing cycle \u2014
p167
aVa kind of wheel of life.
p168
aa(lp169
VNow, I want to leave you with a tribute to one of my mentors.
p170
aVShe reminds me that physical presence is important
p171
aVand that play is not a luxury,
p172
aVbut a necessity.
p173
aVShe's Pixie,
p174
aVand she's our family dog.
p175
aVAnd she loves to jump.

aa(lp179
V(Dog barking and spring boinging)
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd this is a new kind of zoetrope
p182
aVthat I developed at the Imaging Research Center
p183
aVat UMBC in Baltimore.
p184
aVAnd I call it a "real-time zoetrope."
