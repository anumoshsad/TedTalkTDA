VClearly, we're living in a moment of crisis.
p4
aVArguably the financial markets have failed us
p5
aVand the aid system is failing us,
p6
aVand yet I stand firmly with the optimists
p7
aVwho believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive.
p8
aVBecause of some of technologies we've been talking about.
p9
aVBecause of the resources, the skills,
p10
aVand certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world,
p11
aVwith the mindset to create change.
p12
aVAnd we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen,
p13
aVwho recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower,
p14
aVbut that we've got to engage in a different way with the world.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd by definition, every one of you who is in this room
p17
aVmust consider yourself a global soul,
p18
aVa global citizen.
p19
aVYou work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst
p20
aVthat human beings can do for one another and to one another.
p21
aVAnd no matter what country you live or work in,
p22
aVyou've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of,
p23
aVeven in their most ordinariness.
p24
aa(lp25
VToday there is a raging debate
p26
aVas to how best we lift people out of poverty,
p27
aVhow best we release their energies.
p28
aVOn the one hand, we have people that say
p29
aVthe aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.
p30
aVAnd on the other we have people who say
p31
aVthe problem is that we need more aid.
p32
aVAnd what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems.
p33
aVWe call it patient capital.
p34
aa(lp35
VThe critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent
p36
aVin Africa since 1970
p37
aVand say, and what do we have but environmental degradation
p38
aVand incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption?
p39
aVThey use Mobutu as metaphor.
p40
aVAnd their policy prescription is to
p41
aVmake government more accountable,
p42
aVfocus on the capital markets,
p43
aVinvest, don't give anything away.
p44
aa(lp45
VOn the other side, as I said, there are those who say
p46
aVthe problem is that we need more money.
p47
aVThat when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out
p48
aVand we'll hand a lot of aid,
p49
aVbut when it comes to our poor brethren,
p50
aVwe want little to do with it.
p51
aVThey point to the successes of aid:
p52
aVthe eradication of smallpox,
p53
aVand the distribution of tens of millions
p54
aVof malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals.
p55
aVBoth sides are right.
p56
aVAnd the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.
p57
aVEven more problematic, they're not listening to
p58
aVpoor people themselves.
p59
aa(lp60
VAfter 25 years of working on issues of
p61
aVpoverty and innovation,
p62
aVit's true that there are probably no more market-oriented
p63
aVindividuals on the planet
p64
aVthan low-income people.
p65
aVThey must navigate markets daily,
p66
aVmaking micro-decisions, dozens and dozens,
p67
aVto move their way through society,
p68
aVand yet if a single catastrophic health problem
p69
aVimpacts their family,
p70
aVthey could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.
p71
aVAnd so we need both the market
p72
aVand we need aid.
p73
aa(lp74
VPatient capital works between,
p75
aVand tries to take the best of both.
p76
aVIt's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities
p77
aVand are building solutions
p78
aVto healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy,
p79
aVthinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity,
p80
aVbut as individual customers, consumers, clients,
p81
aVpeople who want to make decisions in their own lives.
p82
aa(lp83
VPatient capital requires that we have
p84
aVincredible tolerance for risk,
p85
aVa long time horizon in terms of allowing those
p86
aVentrepreneurs time to experiment,
p87
aVto use the market as the best listening device that we have,
p88
aVand the expectation of below-market returns,
p89
aVbut outsized social impact.
p90
aVIt recognizes that the market has its limitation,
p91
aVand so patient capital also works
p92
aVwith smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy
p93
aVto include all people.
p94
aa(lp95
VNow, entrepreneurs need patient capital
p96
aVfor three reasons.
p97
aVFirst, they tend to work in markets
p98
aVwhere people make one, two, three dollars a day
p99
aVand they are making all of their decisions within that income level.
p100
aVSecond, the geographies in which they work
p101
aVhave terrible infrastructure \u2014
p102
aVno roads to speak of, sporadic electricity
p103
aVand high levels of corruption.
p104
aVThird, they are often creating markets.
p105
aa(lp106
VEven if you're bringing clean water
p107
aVfor the first time into rural villages, it is something new.
p108
aVAnd so many low-income people
p109
aVhave seen so many failed promises broken
p110
aVand seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them
p111
aVthat building trust takes a lot of time,
p112
aVtakes a lot of patience.
p113
aVIt also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.
p114
aVNot only to build the systems,
p115
aVthe business models that allow us
p116
aVto reach low income people in a sustainable way,
p117
aVbut to connect those business
p118
aVto other markets, to governments, to corporations \u2014
p119
aVreal partnerships if we want to get to scale.
p120
aa(lp121
VI want to share one story
p122
aVabout an innovation called drip irrigation.
p123
aVIn 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur
p124
aVnamed Amitabha Sadangi from India,
p125
aVwho'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.
p126
aVAnd he was expressing his frustration
p127
aVthat the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether,
p128
aVdespite the fact that 200 million farmers
p129
aValone in India make under a dollar a day.
p130
aVThey were creating subsidies
p131
aVeither for large farms,
p132
aVor they were giving inputs to the farmers
p133
aVthat they thought they should use, rather than
p134
aVthat the farmers wanted to use.
p135
aa(lp136
VAt the same time Amitabha was
p137
aVobsessed with this drip irrigation technology
p138
aVthat had been invented in Israel.
p139
aVIt was a way of bringing small amounts of water
p140
aVdirectly to the stalk of the plant.
p141
aVAnd it could transform
p142
aVswaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.
p143
aVBut the market also had bypassed low income farmers,
p144
aVbecause these systems were both too expensive,
p145
aVand they were constructed for fields that were too large.
p146
aVThe average small village farmer
p147
aVworks on two acres or less.
p148
aa(lp149
VAnd so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation
p150
aVand he would redesign it from the perspective
p151
aVof the poor farmers themselves,
p152
aVbecause he spent so many years listening to what they needed
p153
aVnot what he thought that they should have.
p154
aVAnd he used three fundamental principles.
p155
aa(lp156
VThe first one was miniaturization.
p157
aVThe drip irrigation system
p158
aVhad to be small enough that a farmer only had
p159
aVto risk a quarter acre,
p160
aVeven if he had two,
p161
aVbecause it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.
p162
aVSecond, it had to be extremely affordable.
p163
aVIn other words, that risk on the quarter acre
p164
aVneeded to be repaid in a single harvest,
p165
aVor else they wouldn't take the risk.
p166
aVAnd third, it had to be what Amitabha calls
p167
aVinfinitely expandable.
p168
aVWhat I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre,
p169
aVthe farmers could buy a second
p170
aVand a third and a fourth.
p171
aa(lp172
VAs of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization,
p173
aVhas sold over 300,000 farmers these systems
p174
aVand has seen their yields and incomes
p175
aVdouble or triple on average,
p176
aVbut this didn't happen overnight.
p177
aVIn fact, when you go back to the beginning,
p178
aVthere were no private investors
p179
aVwho would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology
p180
aVfor a market class that made under a dollar a day,
p181
aVthat were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet
p182
aVand that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.
p183
aa(lp184
VAnd so we needed grants. And he used significant grants
p185
aVto research, to experiment, to fail,
p186
aVto innovate and try again.
p187
aVAnd when he had a prototype
p188
aVand had a better understanding of how to market to farmers,
p189
aVthat's when patient capital could come in.
p190
aVAnd we helped him build a company, for profit,
p191
aVthat would build on IDE's knowledge,
p192
aVand start looking at sales and exports,
p193
aVand be able to tap into other kinds of capital.
p194
aa(lp195
VSecondarily, we wanted to see if we could export
p196
aVthis drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.
p197
aVAnd so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.
p198
aVAnd while, again, you needed patience
p199
aVto move a technology for the poor
p200
aVin India into Pakistan,
p201
aVjust to get the permits,
p202
aVover time we were able to start a company
p203
aVwith Dr. Sono, who runs a large
p204
aVcommunity development organization in the Thar Desert,
p205
aVwhich is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.
p206
aVAnd though that company has just started,
p207
aVour assumption is that there too
p208
aVwe'll see the impact on millions.
p209
aa(lp210
VBut drip irrigation isn't the only innovation.
p211
aVWe're starting to see these happening all around the world.
p212
aVIn Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing
p213
aVhas worked in partnership with us,
p214
aVwith UNICEF, with the Global Fund,
p215
aVto create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women.
p216
aVAnd they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets
p217
aVfor Africans around the world.
p218
aa(lp219
VLifespring Hospital
p220
aVis a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India
p221
aVto bring quality, affordable maternal health care
p222
aVto low-income women,
p223
aVand it's been so successful that it's currently building
p224
aVa new hospital every 35 days.
p225
aa(lp226
VAnd 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to
p227
aVreinvent a completely broken industry,
p228
aVbuilding an ambulance service in Bombay
p229
aVthat would use the technology of Google Earth,
p230
aVa sliding scale pricing system
p231
aVso that all people could have access,
p232
aVand a severe and public decision
p233
aVnot to engage in any form of corruption.
p234
aVSo that in the terrorist attacks of November
p235
aVthey were the first responder,
p236
aVand are now beginning to scale, because of partnership.
p237
aVThey've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances,
p238
aVand are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies
p239
aVin India.
p240
aa(lp241
VThis idea of scale is critical.
p242
aVBecause we're starting to see these enterprises
p243
aVreach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed
p244
aVhave reached at least a quarter million people.
p245
aVBut that's obviously not enough.
p246
aVAnd it's where the idea of partnership
p247
aVbecomes so important.
p248
aVWhether it's by finding those innovations
p249
aVthat can access the capital markets,
p250
aVgovernment itself, or partner with major corporations,
p251
aVthere is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.
p252
aa(lp253
VPresident Obama understands that.
p254
aVHe recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund
p255
aVto focus on what works in this country,
p256
aVand look at how we can scale it.
p257
aVAnd I would submit that it's time to consider
p258
aVa global innovation fund
p259
aVthat would find these entrepreneurs around the world
p260
aVwho really have innovations, not only for their country,
p261
aVbut ones that we can use in the developed world as well.
p262
aVInvest financial assistance, but also management assistance.
p263
aVAnd then measure the returns,
p264
aVboth from a financial perspective
p265
aVand from a social impact perspective.
p266
aa(lp267
VWhen we think about new approaches to aid,
p268
aVit's impossible not to talk about Pakistan.
p269
aVWe've had a rocky relationship with that country
p270
aVand, in all fairness,
p271
aVthe United States has not always been a very reliable partner.
p272
aVBut again I would say that this is our moment
p273
aVfor extraordinary things to happen.
p274
aVAnd if we take that notion of a global innovation fund,
p275
aVwe could use this time to invest
p276
aVnot directly in government, though we would have government's blessing,
p277
aVnor in international experts,
p278
aVbut in the many existing entrepreneurs
p279
aVand civil society leaders
p280
aVwho already are building wonderful innovations
p281
aVthat are reaching people all across the country.
p282
aa(lp283
VPeople like Rashani Zafar,
p284
aVwho created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country,
p285
aVand is a real role model for women inside and outside the country.
p286
aVAnd Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way
p287
aVcalled incremental housing,
p288
aVwhere he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers
p289
aVinto safe, affordable community housing.
p290
aVEducational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation
p291
aVthat are building schools across the country.
p292
aVIt's not hyperbole
p293
aVto say that these civil society institutions
p294
aVand these social entrepreneurs
p295
aVare building real alternatives to the Taliban.
p296
aa(lp297
VI've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now,
p298
aVand those of you who've also worked there
p299
aVcan attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population,
p300
aVand there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.
p301
aa(lp302
VPresident Kennedy said that
p303
aVthose who make peaceful revolution impossible
p304
aVmake violent revolution inevitable.
p305
aVI would say that the converse is true.
p306
aVThat these social leaders
p307
aVwho really are looking at innovation
p308
aVand extending opportunity
p309
aVto the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day,
p310
aVprovide real pathways to hope.
p311
aVAnd as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan,
p312
aVwhile we need to strengthen the judiciary,
p313
aVbuild greater stability,
p314
aVwe also need to think about lifting those leaders
p315
aVwho can be role models for the rest of the world.
p316
aa(lp317
VOn one of my last visits to Pakistan,
p318
aVI asked Dr. Sono if he would take me
p319
aVto see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert.
p320
aVAnd we left Karachi one morning before dawn.
p321
aVIt was about 115 degrees.
p322
aVAnd we drove for eight hours
p323
aValong this moonscape-like landscape
p324
aVwith very little color, lots of heat,
p325
aVvery little discussion, because we were exhausted.
p326
aa(lp327
VAnd finally, at the end of the journey,
p328
aVI could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon.
p329
aVAnd as we got closer, its significance became apparent.
p330
aVThat there in the desert
p331
aVwas a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall.
p332
aVBecause one of the poorest farmers on Earth
p333
aVhad gotten access to a technology
p334
aVthat had allowed him to change his own life.
p335
aVHis name was Raja,
p336
aVand he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes
p337
aVand warm expressive hands
p338
aVthat reminded me of my father.
p339
aa(lp340
VAnd he said it was the first dry season
p341
aVin his entire life that he hadn't taken
p342
aVhis 12 children and 50 grandchildren
p343
aVon a two day journey across the desert
p344
aVto work as day laborers at a commercial farm
p345
aVfor about 50 cents a day.
p346
aVBecause he was building these crops.
p347
aVAnd with the money he earned he could stay this year.
p348
aVAnd for the first time ever in three generations,
p349
aVhis children would go to school.
p350
aa(lp351
VWe asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons.
p352
aVAnd he said, "Of course I will.
p353
aVBecause I don't want them discriminated against anymore."
p354
aVWhen we think about solutions to poverty,
p355
aVwe cannot deny individuals
p356
aVtheir fundamental dignity.
p357
aVBecause at the end of the day,
p358
aVdignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.
p359
aVAnd what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors
p360
aVwho are building innovations that recognize
p361
aVthat what people want is freedom
p362
aVand choice and opportunity.
p363
aVBecause that is where dignity really starts.
p364
aa(lp365
VMartin Luther King said that
p366
aVlove without power is anemic and sentimental,
p367
aVand that power without love
p368
aVis reckless and abusive.
p369
aVOur generation has seen both approaches tried,
p370
aVand often fail.
p371
aVBut I think our generation also might be the first
p372
aVto have the courage to embrace both love and power.
p373
aVFor that is what we'll need, as we move forward
p374
aVto dream and imagine what it will really take
p375
aVto build a global economy that includes all of us,
p376
aVand to finally extend that fundamental proposition
p377
aVthat all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.
p378
aa(lp379
VThe time for us to begin innovating
p380
aVand looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now.
p381
aVI can only talk from my own experience,
p382
aVbut in eight years of running Acumen fund,
p383
aVI've seen the power of patient capital.
p384
aVNot only to inspire innovation and risk taking,
p385
aVbut to truly build systems that have created
p386
aVmore than 25,000 jobs
p387
aVand delivered tens of millions of services and products
p388
aVto some of the poorest people on the planet.
p389
aVI know it works.
p390
aVBut I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.
p391
aa(lp392
VAnd so I urge you, in whatever sector you work,
p393
aVin whatever job you do,
p394
aVto start thinking about how we might
p395
aVbuild solutions that start
p396
aVfrom the perspective of those we're trying to help.
p397
aVRather than what we think that they might need.
p398
aVIt will take embracing the world with both arms.
p399
aVAnd it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability,
p400
aVwith a sense of integrity and perseverance.
p401
aVAnd yet these are the very qualities
p402
aVfor which men and women have been honored
p403
aVthroughout the generations.
p404
aVAnd there is so much good that we can do.
p405
aVJust think of all those sunflowers in the desert.
p406
aVThank you.
