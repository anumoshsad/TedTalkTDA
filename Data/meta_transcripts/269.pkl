VCultural evolution is a dangerous child
p4
aVfor any species to let loose on its planet.
p5
aVBy the time you realize what's happening, the child is a toddler,
p6
aVup and causing havoc, and it's too late to put it back.
p7
aVWe humans are Earth's Pandoran species.
p8
aVWe're the ones who let the second replicator out of its box,
p9
aVand we can't push it back in.
p10
aVWe're seeing the consequences all around us.
p11
aa(lp12
VNow that, I suggest, is the view that
p13
aVcomes out of taking memetics seriously.
p14
aVAnd it gives us a new way of thinking about
p15
aVnot only what's going on on our planet,
p16
aVbut what might be going on elsewhere in the cosmos.
p17
aVSo first of all, I'd like to say something about memetics
p18
aVand the theory of memes,
p19
aVand secondly, how this might answer questions about who's out there,
p20
aVif indeed anyone is.
p21
aa(lp22
VSo, memetics:
p23
aVmemetics is founded on the principle of Universal Darwinism.
p24
aVDarwin had this amazing idea.
p25
aVIndeed, some people say
p26
aVit's the best idea anybody ever had.
p27
aVIsn't that a wonderful thought, that there could be such a thing
p28
aVas a best idea anybody ever had?
p29
aVDo you think there could?
p30
aVAudience: No.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aVSusan Blackmore: Someone says no, very loudly, from over there.
p33
aVWell, I say yes, and if there is, I give the prize to Darwin.
p34
aa(lp35
VWhy?
p36
aVBecause the idea was so simple,
p37
aVand yet it explains all design in the universe.
p38
aVI would say not just biological design,
p39
aVbut all of the design that we think of as human design.
p40
aVIt's all just the same thing happening.
p41
aVWhat did Darwin say?
p42
aVI know you know the idea, natural selection,
p43
aVbut let me just paraphrase "The Origin of Species," 1859,
p44
aVin a few sentences.
p45
aa(lp46
VWhat Darwin said was something like this:
p47
aVif you have creatures that vary, and that can't be doubted \u2014
p48
aVI've been to the Galapagos, and I've measured the size of the beaks
p49
aVand the size of the turtle shells and so on, and so on.
p50
aVAnd 100 pages later.
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aVAnd if there is a struggle for life,
p53
aVsuch that nearly all of these creatures die \u2014
p54
aVand this can't be doubted, I've read Malthus
p55
aVand I've calculated how long it would take for elephants
p56
aVto cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted, and so on and so on.
p57
aVAnd another 100 pages later.
p58
aVAnd if the very few that survive pass onto their offspring
p59
aVwhatever it was that helped them survive,
p60
aVthen those offspring must be better adapted
p61
aVto the circumstances in which all this happened
p62
aVthan their parents were.
p63
aa(lp64
VYou see the idea?
p65
aVIf, if, if, then.
p66
aVHe had no concept of the idea of an algorithm,
p67
aVbut that's what he described in that book,
p68
aVand this is what we now know as the evolutionary algorithm.
p69
aVThe principle is you just need those three things \u2014
p70
aVvariation, selection and heredity.
p71
aVAnd as Dan Dennett puts it, if you have those,
p72
aVthen you must get evolution.
p73
aVOr design out of chaos, without the aid of mind.
p74
aa(lp75
VThere's one word I love on that slide.
p76
aVWhat do you think my favorite word is?
p77
aVAudience: Chaos.
p78
aVSB: Chaos? No. What? Mind? No.
p79
aVAudience: Without.
p80
aVSB: No, not without.
p81
aV(Laughter)
p82
aVYou try them all in order: Mmm...?
p83
aVAudience: Must.
p84
aVSB: Must, at must. Must, must.
p85
aVThis is what makes it so amazing.
p86
aVYou don't need a designer,
p87
aVor a plan, or foresight, or anything else.
p88
aVIf there's something that is copied with variation
p89
aVand it's selected, then you must get design appearing out of nowhere.
p90
aVYou can't stop it.
p91
aVMust is my favorite word there.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow, what's this to do with memes?
p94
aVWell, the principle here applies to anything
p95
aVthat is copied with variation and selection.
p96
aVWe're so used to thinking in terms of biology,
p97
aVwe think about genes this way.
p98
aVDarwin didn't, of course; he didn't know about genes.
p99
aVHe talked mostly about animals and plants,
p100
aVbut also about languages evolving and becoming extinct.
p101
aVBut the principle of Universal Darwinism
p102
aVis that any information that is varied and selected
p103
aVwill produce design.
p104
aa(lp105
VAnd this is what Richard Dawkins was on about
p106
aVin his 1976 bestseller, "The Selfish Gene."
p107
aVThe information that is copied, he called the replicator.
p108
aVIt selfishly copies.
p109
aVNot meaning it kind of sits around inside cells going, "I want to get copied."
p110
aVBut that it will get copied if it can,
p111
aVregardless of the consequences.
p112
aVIt doesn't care about the consequences because it can't,
p113
aVbecause it's just information being copied.
p114
aVAnd he wanted to get away
p115
aVfrom everybody thinking all the time about genes,
p116
aVand so he said, "Is there another replicator out there on the planet?"
p117
aVAh, yes, there is.
p118
aa(lp119
VLook around you \u2014 here will do, in this room.
p120
aVAll around us, still clumsily drifting about
p121
aVin its primeval soup of culture, is another replicator.
p122
aVInformation that we copy from person to person, by imitation,
p123
aVby language, by talking, by telling stories,
p124
aVby wearing clothes, by doing things.
p125
aVThis is information copied with variation and selection.
p126
aVThis is design process going on.
p127
aVHe wanted a name for the new replicator.
p128
aVSo, he took the Greek word "mimeme," which means that which is imitated.
p129
aVRemember that, that's the core definition:
p130
aVthat which is imitated.
p131
aVAnd abbreviated it to meme, just because it sounds good
p132
aVand made a good meme, an effective spreading meme.
p133
aVSo that's how the idea came about.
p134
aVIt's important to stick with that definition.
p135
aa(lp136
VThe whole science of memetics is much maligned,
p137
aVmuch misunderstood, much feared.
p138
aVBut a lot of these problems can be avoided
p139
aVby remembering the definition.
p140
aVA meme is not equivalent to an idea.
p141
aVIt's not an idea. It's not equivalent to anything else, really.
p142
aVStick with the definition.
p143
aVIt's that which is imitated,
p144
aVor information which is copied from person to person.
p145
aVSo, let's see some memes.
p146
aa(lp147
VWell, you sir, you've got those glasses hung around your neck
p148
aVin that particularly fetching way.
p149
aVI wonder whether you invented that idea for yourself,
p150
aVor copied it from someone else?
p151
aVIf you copied it from someone else, it's a meme.
p152
aVAnd what about, oh, I can't see any interesting memes here.
p153
aVAll right everyone, who's got some interesting memes for me?
p154
aVOh, well, your earrings,
p155
aVI don't suppose you invented the idea of earrings.
p156
aVYou probably went out and bought them.
p157
aVThere are plenty more in the shops.
p158
aVThat's something that's passed on from person to person.
p159
aVAll the stories that we're telling \u2014 well, of course,
p160
aVTED is a great meme-fest, masses of memes.
p161
aa(lp162
VThe way to think about memes, though,
p163
aVis to think, why do they spread?
p164
aVThey're selfish information, they will get copied, if they can.
p165
aVBut some of them will be copied because they're good,
p166
aVor true, or useful, or beautiful.
p167
aVSome of them will be copied even though they're not.
p168
aVSome, it's quite hard to tell why.
p169
aa(lp170
VThere's one particular curious meme which I rather enjoy.
p171
aVAnd I'm glad to say, as I expected, I found it when I came here,
p172
aVand I'm sure all of you found it, too.
p173
aVYou go to your nice, posh, international hotel somewhere,
p174
aVand you come in and you put down your clothes
p175
aVand you go to the bathroom, and what do you see?
p176
aVAudience: Bathroom soap.
p177
aVSB: Pardon?
p178
aVAudience: Soap.
p179
aVSB: Soap, yeah. What else do you see?
p180
aVAudience: (Inaudible)
p181
aVSB: Mmm mmm.
p182
aVAudience: Sink, toilet!
p183
aVSB: Sink, toilet, yes, these are all memes, they're all memes,
p184
aVbut they're sort of useful ones, and then there's this one.
p185
aV(Laughter)
p186
aVWhat is this one doing?
p187
aV(Laughter)
p188
aVThis has spread all over the world.
p189
aVIt's not surprising that you all found it
p190
aVwhen you arrived in your bathrooms here.
p191
aVBut I took this photograph in a toilet at the back of a tent
p192
aVin the eco-camp in the jungle in Assam.
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aVWho folded that thing up there, and why?
p195
aV(Laughter)
p196
aVSome people get carried away.
p197
aV(Laughter)
p198
aVOther people are just lazy and make mistakes.
p199
aVSome hotels exploit the opportunity to put even more memes
p200
aVwith a little sticker.
p201
aV(Laughter)
p202
aVWhat is this all about?
p203
aVI suppose it's there to tell you that somebody's
p204
aVcleaned the place, and it's all lovely.
p205
aVAnd you know, actually, all it tells you is that another person
p206
aVhas potentially spread germs from place to place.
p207
aV(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VSo, think of it this way.
p210
aVImagine a world full of brains
p211
aVand far more memes than can possibly find homes.
p212
aVThe memes are all trying to get copied \u2014
p213
aVtrying, in inverted commas \u2014 i.e.,
p214
aVthat's the shorthand for, if they can get copied, they will.
p215
aVThey're using you and me as their propagating, copying machinery,
p216
aVand we are the meme machines.
p217
aa(lp218
VNow, why is this important?
p219
aVWhy is this useful, or what does it tell us?
p220
aVIt gives us a completely new view of human origins
p221
aVand what it means to be human,
p222
aVall conventional theories of cultural evolution,
p223
aVof the origin of humans,
p224
aVand what makes us so different from other species.
p225
aVAll other theories explaining the big brain, and language, and tool use
p226
aVand all these things that make us unique,
p227
aVare based upon genes.
p228
aVLanguage must have been useful for the genes.
p229
aVTool use must have enhanced our survival, mating and so on.
p230
aVIt always comes back, as Richard Dawkins complained
p231
aVall that long time ago, it always comes back to genes.
p232
aa(lp233
VThe point of memetics is to say, "Oh no, it doesn't."
p234
aVThere are two replicators now on this planet.
p235
aVFrom the moment that our ancestors,
p236
aVperhaps two and a half million years ago or so,
p237
aVbegan imitating, there was a new copying process.
p238
aVCopying with variation and selection.
p239
aVA new replicator was let loose, and it could never be \u2014
p240
aVright from the start \u2014 it could never be
p241
aVthat human beings who let loose this new creature,
p242
aVcould just copy the useful, beautiful, true things,
p243
aVand not copy the other things.
p244
aVWhile their brains were having an advantage from being able to copy \u2014
p245
aVlighting fires, keeping fires going, new techniques of hunting,
p246
aVthese kinds of things \u2014
p247
aVinevitably they were also copying putting feathers in their hair,
p248
aVor wearing strange clothes, or painting their faces,
p249
aVor whatever.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo, you get an arms race between the genes
p252
aVwhich are trying to get the humans to have small economical brains
p253
aVand not waste their time copying all this stuff,
p254
aVand the memes themselves, like the sounds that people made and copied \u2014
p255
aVin other words, what turned out to be language \u2014
p256
aVcompeting to get the brains to get bigger and bigger.
p257
aVSo, the big brain, on this theory, is driven by the memes.
p258
aa(lp259
VThis is why, in "The Meme Machine," I called it memetic drive.
p260
aVAs the memes evolve, as they inevitably must,
p261
aVthey drive a bigger brain that is better at copying the memes
p262
aVthat are doing the driving.
p263
aVThis is why we've ended up with such peculiar brains,
p264
aVthat we like religion, and music, and art.
p265
aVLanguage is a parasite that we've adapted to,
p266
aVnot something that was there originally for our genes,
p267
aVon this view.
p268
aVAnd like most parasites, it can begin dangerous,
p269
aVbut then it coevolves and adapts,
p270
aVand we end up with a symbiotic relationship
p271
aVwith this new parasite.
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd so, from our perspective,
p274
aVwe don't realize that that's how it began.
p275
aVSo, this is a view of what humans are.
p276
aVAll other species on this planet are gene machines only,
p277
aVthey don't imitate at all well, hardly at all.
p278
aVWe alone are gene machines and meme machines as well.
p279
aVThe memes took a gene machine and turned it into a meme machine.
p280
aa(lp281
VBut that's not all.
p282
aVWe have a new kind of memes now.
p283
aVI've been wondering for a long time,
p284
aVsince I've been thinking about memes a lot,
p285
aVis there a difference between the memes that we copy \u2014
p286
aVthe words we speak to each other,
p287
aVthe gestures we copy, the human things \u2014
p288
aVand all these technological things around us?
p289
aVI have always, until now, called them all memes,
p290
aVbut I do honestly think now
p291
aVwe need a new word for technological memes.
p292
aa(lp293
VLet's call them techno-memes or temes.
p294
aVBecause the processes are getting different.
p295
aVWe began, perhaps 5,000 years ago, with writing.
p296
aVWe put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet,
p297
aVbut in order to get true temes and true teme machines,
p298
aVyou need to get the variation, the selection and the copying,
p299
aVall done outside of humans.
p300
aVAnd we're getting there.
p301
aVWe're at this extraordinary point where we're nearly there,
p302
aVthat there are machines like that.
p303
aVAnd indeed, in the short time I've already been at TED,
p304
aVI see we're even closer than I thought we were before.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo actually, now the temes are forcing our brains
p307
aVto become more like teme machines.
p308
aVOur children are growing up very quickly learning to read,
p309
aVlearning to use machinery.
p310
aVWe're going to have all kinds of implants,
p311
aVdrugs that force us to stay awake all the time.
p312
aVWe'll think we're choosing these things,
p313
aVbut the temes are making us do it.
p314
aVSo, we're at this cusp now
p315
aVof having a third replicator on our planet.
p316
aVNow, what about what else is going on out there in the universe?
p317
aVIs there anyone else out there?
p318
aVPeople have been asking this question for a long time.
p319
aVWe've been asking it here at TED already.
p320
aVIn 1961, Frank Drake made his famous equation,
p321
aVbut I think he concentrated on the wrong things.
p322
aVIt's been very productive, that equation.
p323
aVHe wanted to estimate N,
p324
aVthe number of communicative civilizations out there in our galaxy,
p325
aVand he included in there the rate of star formation,
p326
aVthe rate of planets, but crucially, intelligence.
p327
aa(lp328
VI think that's the wrong way to think about it.
p329
aVIntelligence appears all over the place, in all kinds of guises.
p330
aVHuman intelligence is only one kind of a thing.
p331
aVBut what's really important is the replicators you have
p332
aVand the levels of replicators, one feeding on the one before.
p333
aVSo, I would suggest that we don't think intelligence,
p334
aVwe think replicators.
p335
aa(lp336
VAnd on that basis, I've suggested a different kind of equation.
p337
aVA very simple equation.
p338
aVN, the same thing,
p339
aVthe number of communicative civilizations out there
p340
aV[that] we might expect in our galaxy.
p341
aVJust start with the number of planets there are in our galaxy.
p342
aVThe fraction of those which get a first replicator.
p343
aVThe fraction of those that get the second replicator.
p344
aVThe fraction of those that get the third replicator.
p345
aVBecause it's only the third replicator that's going to reach out \u2014
p346
aVsending information, sending probes, getting out there,
p347
aVand communicating with anywhere else.
p348
aa(lp349
VOK, so if we take that equation,
p350
aVwhy haven't we heard from anybody out there?
p351
aVBecause every step is dangerous.
p352
aVGetting a new replicator is dangerous.
p353
aVYou can pull through, we have pulled through,
p354
aVbut it's dangerous.
p355
aVTake the first step, as soon as life appeared on this earth.
p356
aVWe may take the Gaian view.
p357
aVI loved Peter Ward's talk yesterday \u2014 it's not Gaian all the time.
p358
aVActually, life forms produce things that kill themselves.
p359
aVWell, we did pull through on this planet.
p360
aa(lp361
VBut then, a long time later, billions of years later,
p362
aVwe got the second replicator, the memes.
p363
aVThat was dangerous, all right.
p364
aVThink of the big brain.
p365
aVHow many mothers do we have here?
p366
aVYou know all about big brains.
p367
aVThey are dangerous to give birth to,
p368
aVare agonizing to give birth to.
p369
aV(Laughter)
p370
aVMy cat gave birth to four kittens, purring all the time.
p371
aVAh, mm \u2014 slightly different.
p372
aV(Laughter)
p373
aa(lp374
VBut not only is it painful, it kills lots of babies,
p375
aVit kills lots of mothers,
p376
aVand it's very expensive to produce.
p377
aVThe genes are forced into producing all this myelin,
p378
aVall the fat to myelinate the brain.
p379
aVDo you know, sitting here,
p380
aVyour brain is using about 20 percent of your body's energy output
p381
aVfor two percent of your body weight?
p382
aVIt's a really expensive organ to run.
p383
aVWhy? Because it's producing the memes.
p384
aa(lp385
VNow, it could have killed us off. It could have killed us off,
p386
aVand maybe it nearly did, but you see, we don't know.
p387
aVBut maybe it nearly did.
p388
aVHas it been tried before?
p389
aVWhat about all those other species?
p390
aVLouise Leakey talked yesterday
p391
aVabout how we're the only one in this branch left.
p392
aVWhat happened to the others?
p393
aVCould it be that this experiment in imitation,
p394
aVthis experiment in a second replicator,
p395
aVis dangerous enough to kill people off?
p396
aa(lp397
VWell, we did pull through, and we adapted.
p398
aVBut now, we're hitting, as I've just described,
p399
aVwe're hitting the third replicator point.
p400
aVAnd this is even more dangerous \u2014
p401
aVwell, it's dangerous again.
p402
aVWhy? Because the temes are selfish replicators
p403
aVand they don't care about us, or our planet, or anything else.
p404
aVThey're just information, why would they?
p405
aVThey are using us to suck up the planet's resources
p406
aVto produce more computers,
p407
aVand more of all these amazing things we're hearing about here at TED.
p408
aVDon't think, "Oh, we created the Internet for our own benefit."
p409
aVThat's how it seems to us.
p410
aVThink, temes spreading because they must.
p411
aVWe are the old machines.
p412
aa(lp413
VNow, are we going to pull through?
p414
aVWhat's going to happen?
p415
aVWhat does it mean to pull through?
p416
aVWell, there are kind of two ways of pulling through.
p417
aVOne that is obviously happening all around us now,
p418
aVis that the temes turn us into teme machines,
p419
aVwith these implants, with the drugs,
p420
aVwith us merging with the technology.
p421
aVAnd why would they do that?
p422
aVBecause we are self-replicating.
p423
aVWe have babies.
p424
aVWe make new ones, and so it's convenient to piggyback on us,
p425
aVbecause we're not yet at the stage on this planet
p426
aVwhere the other option is viable.
p427
aVAlthough it's closer, I heard this morning,
p428
aVit's closer than I thought it was.
p429
aVWhere the teme machines themselves will replicate themselves.
p430
aVThat way, it wouldn't matter if the planet's climate
p431
aVwas utterly destabilized,
p432
aVand it was no longer possible for humans to live here.
p433
aVBecause those teme machines, they wouldn't need \u2014
p434
aVthey're not squishy, wet, oxygen-breathing,
p435
aVwarmth-requiring creatures.
p436
aVThey could carry on without us.
p437
