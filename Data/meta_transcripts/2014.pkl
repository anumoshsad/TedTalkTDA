VEven nature's most disgusting creatures
p4
aVhave important secrets,
p5
aVbut who would want a swarm of cockroaches
p6
aVcoming towards them?
p7
aa(lp8
VYet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies
p9
aVrelates to robustness.
p10
aVRobust systems are stable in complex
p11
aVand new environments.
p12
aVRemarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize
p13
aVrunning over rough terrain.
p14
aVWhen we put a jet pack on them,
p15
aVor give them a perturbation like an earthquake,
p16
aVwe discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs
p17
aVallow them to self-stabilize
p18
aVwithout using any of their brainpower.
p19
aVThey can go over complex terrain like grass,
p20
aVno problem, and not get destabilized.
p21
aVWe discovered a new behavior where,
p22
aVbecause of their shape,
p23
aVthey actually roll automatically to their side
p24
aVto go through this artificial test bit of grass.
p25
aa(lp26
VRobust systems can perform multiple tasks
p27
aVwith the same structure.
p28
aVHere's a new behavior we've discovered.
p29
aVThe animals rapidly invert and disappear
p30
aVin less than 150 milliseconds \u2014 you never see them \u2014
p31
aVusing the same structures that they use to run, their legs.
p32
aVThey can run upside down
p33
aVvery rapidly on rods, branches and wires,
p34
aVand if you perturb one of those branches,
p35
aVthey can do this.
p36
aVThey can perform gymnastic maneuvers
p37
aVlike no robot we have yet.
p38
aVAnd they have nearly unlimited
p39
aVmaneuverability with that same structure
p40
aVand unprecedented access to a variety
p41
aVof different areas.
p42
aVThey have wings for flying when they get warm,
p43
aVbut they use those same wings to flip over
p44
aVif they get destabilized.
p45
aVVery effective.
p46
aa(lp47
VRobust systems are also fault tolerant and fail-safe.
p48
aVThis is the foot of a cockroach.
p49
aVIt has spines, gluey pads and claws,
p50
aVbut if you take off those feet,
p51
aVthey can still go over rough terrain,
p52
aVlike the bottom video that you see,
p53
aVwithout hardly slowing down. Extraordinary.
p54
aVThey can run up mesh without their feet.
p55
aVHere's an animal using a normal, alternating tripod:
p56
aVthree legs, three legs, three legs,
p57
aVbut in nature, the insects often have lost their legs.
p58
aVHere's one moving with two middle legs gone.
p59
aVIt can even lose three legs, in a tripod,
p60
aVand adopt a new gait, a hopping gait.
p61
aVAnd I point out that all of these videos
p62
aVare slowed down 20 times,
p63
aVso they're actually really fast, when you see this.
p64
aa(lp65
VRobust systems are also damage resistant.
p66
aVHere's an animal climbing up a wall.
p67
aVIt looks like a rapid, smooth, vertical climb,
p68
aVbut when you slow it down,
p69
aVyou see something very different.
p70
aVHere's what they do.
p71
aVThey intentionally have a head-on collision with the wall
p72
aVso they don't slow down and can transition up it
p73
aVin 75 milliseconds.
p74
aVAnd they can do this in part because they have
p75
aVextraordinary exoskeletons.
p76
aVAnd they're really just made up of compliant joints
p77
aVthat are tubes and plates
p78
aVconnected to one another.
p79
aVHere's a dissection of an abdomen of a cockroach.
p80
aVYou see these plates, and you see the compliant membrane.
p81
aa(lp82
VMy engineering colleague at Berkeley
p83
aVdesigned with his students
p84
aVa novel manufacturing technique
p85
aVwhere you essentially origami the exoskeleton,
p86
aVyou laser cut it, laminate it,
p87
aVand you fold it up into a robot.
p88
aVAnd you can do that now in less than 15 minutes.
p89
aVThese robots, called DASH,
p90
aVfor Dynamic Autonomous Sprawled Hexapod,
p91
aVare highly compliant robots,
p92
aVand they're remarkably robust as a result
p93
aVof these features.
p94
aVThey're certainly incredibly damage resistant.
p95
aV(Laughter)
p96
aVThey even have some of the behaviors of the cockroaches.
p97
aVSo they can use their smart, compliant body
p98
aVto transition up a wall
p99
aVin a very simple way.
p100
aVThey even have some of the beginnings
p101
aVof the rapid inversion behavior
p102
aVwhere they disappear.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow we want to know why they can go anywhere.
p105
aVWe discovered that they can go through
p106
aVthree-millimeter gaps,
p107
aVthe height of two pennies, two stacked pennies,
p108
aVand when they do this,
p109
aVthey can actually run through those confined spaces
p110
aVat high speeds,
p111
aValthough you never see it.
p112
aVTo understand it better,
p113
aVwe did a CT scan of the exoskeleton
p114
aVand showed that they can compress their body
p115
aVby over 40 percent.
p116
aVWe put them in a materials testing machine
p117
aVto look at the stress strain analysis
p118
aVand showed that they can withstand forces
p119
aV800 times their body weight,
p120
aVand after this they can fly and run
p121
aVabsolutely normally.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo you never know where
p124
aVcuriosity-based research will lead,
p125
aVand someday you may want a swarm
p126
aVof cockroach-inspired robots
p127
aVto come at you.
