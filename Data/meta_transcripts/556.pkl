VAll human life,
p4
aVall life, depends on plants.
p5
aVLet me try to convince you of that in a few seconds.
p6
aVJust think for a moment.
p7
aVIt doesn't matter whether you live in a small African village,
p8
aVor you live in a big city,
p9
aVeverything comes back to plants in the end:
p10
aVwhether it's for the food, the medicine,
p11
aVthe fuel, the construction, the clothing, all the obvious things;
p12
aVor whether it's for the spiritual and recreational things
p13
aVthat matter to us so much;
p14
aVor whether it's soil formation,
p15
aVor the effect on the atmosphere,
p16
aVor primary production.
p17
aVDamn it, even the books here are made out of plants.
p18
aVAll these things, they come back to plants.
p19
aVAnd without them we wouldn't be here.
p20
aa(lp21
VNow plants are under threat.
p22
aVThey're under threat because of changing climate.
p23
aVAnd they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet
p24
aVwith people like us.
p25
aVAnd people like us want to do things that destroy plants,
p26
aVand their habitats.
p27
aVAnd whether that's because of food production,
p28
aVor because of the introduction of alien plants
p29
aVinto places that they really oughtn't be,
p30
aVor because of habitats being used for other purposes \u2014
p31
aVall these things are meaning that plants have to adapt,
p32
aVor die, or move.
p33
aVAnd plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move
p34
aVbecause there might be cities and other things in the way.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo if all human life depends on plants,
p37
aVdoesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them?
p38
aVI think it does.
p39
aVAnd I want to tell you about a project to save plants.
p40
aVAnd the way that you save plants
p41
aVis by storing seeds.
p42
aVBecause seeds, in all their diverse glory,
p43
aVare plants' futures.
p44
aVAll the genetic information for future generations of plants
p45
aVare held in seeds.
p46
aVSo here is the building;
p47
aVit looks rather unassuming, really.
p48
aVBut it goes down below ground many stories.
p49
aVAnd it's the largest seed bank in the world.
p50
aVIt exists not only in southern England,
p51
aVbut distributed around the world. I'll come to that.
p52
aVThis is a nuclear-proof facility.
p53
aVGod forbid that it should have to withstand that.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo if you're going to build a seed bank, you have to decide
p56
aVwhat you're going to store in it. Right?
p57
aVAnd we decided that what we want to store first of all,
p58
aVare the species that are most under threat.
p59
aVAnd those are the dry land species.
p60
aVSo first of all we did deals
p61
aVwith 50 different countries.
p62
aVIt means negotiating with heads of state,
p63
aVand with secretaries of state in 50 countries
p64
aVto sign treaties.
p65
aVWe have 120 partner institutions all over the world,
p66
aVin all those countries colored orange.
p67
aVPeople come from all over the world to learn,
p68
aVand then they go away and plan exactly how
p69
aVthey're going to collect these seeds.
p70
aVThey have thousands of people all over the world
p71
aVtagging places where those plants are said to exist.
p72
aVThey search for them. They find them in flower.
p73
aVAnd they go back when their seeds have arrived.
p74
aVAnd they collect the seeds. All over the world.
p75
aa(lp76
VThe seeds \u2014 some of if is very untechnical.
p77
aVYou kind of shovel them all in to bags and dry them off.
p78
aVYou label them. You do some high-tech things here and there,
p79
aVsome low-tech things here and there.
p80
aVAnd the main thing is that you have to dry them
p81
aVvery carefully, at low temperature.
p82
aVAnd then you have to store them
p83
aVat about minus 20 degrees C \u2014
p84
aVthat's about minus four Fahrenheit, I think \u2014
p85
aVwith a very critically low moisture content.
p86
aVAnd these seeds will be able to germinate,
p87
aVwe believe, with many of the species,
p88
aVin thousands of years,
p89
aVand certainly in hundreds of years.
p90
aa(lp91
VIt's no good storing the seeds if you don't know they're still viable.
p92
aVSo every 10 years we do germination tests
p93
aVon every sample of seeds that we have.
p94
aVAnd this is a distributed network.
p95
aVSo all around the world people are doing the same thing.
p96
aVAnd that enables us to develop germination protocols.
p97
aVThat means that we know the right combination of heat
p98
aVand cold and the cycles that you have to get
p99
aVto make the seed germinate.
p100
aVAnd that is very useful information.
p101
aVAnd then we grow these things,
p102
aVand we tell people, back in the countries where these seeds have come from,
p103
aV"Look, actually we're not just storing this
p104
aVto get the seeds later,
p105
aVbut we can give you this information about
p106
aVhow to germinate these difficult plants."
p107
aVAnd that's already happening.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo where have we got to?
p110
aVI am pleased to unveil that our three billionth seed \u2014
p111
aVthat's three thousand millionth seed \u2014
p112
aVis now stored.
p113
aVTen percent of all plant species on the planet,
p114
aV24,000 species are safe;
p115
aV30,000 species, if we get the funding, by next year.
p116
aVTwenty-five percent of all the world's plants, by 2020.
p117
aVThese are not just crop plants,
p118
aVas you might have seen stored in Svalbard in Norway \u2014
p119
aVfantastic work there.
p120
aVThis is at least 100 times bigger.
p121
aVWe have thousands of collections that have been sent out
p122
aVall over the world:
p123
aVdrought-tolerant forest species sent to Pakistan and Egypt;
p124
aVespecially photosynthetic-efficient plants
p125
aVcome here to the United States;
p126
aVsalt-tolerant pasture species sent to Australia;
p127
aVthe list goes on and on.
p128
aa(lp129
VThese seeds are used for restoration.
p130
aVSo in habitats that have already been damaged,
p131
aVlike the tall grass prairie here in the USA,
p132
aVor in mined land in various countries,
p133
aVrestoration is already happening because of these species \u2014
p134
aVand because of this collection.
p135
aVSome of these plants, like the ones on the bottom
p136
aVto the left of your screen,
p137
aVthey are down to the last few remaining members.
p138
aVThe one where the guy is collecting seeds there on the truck,
p139
aVthat is down to about 30 last remaining trees.
p140
aVFantastically useful plant,
p141
aVboth for protein and for medicine.
p142
aa(lp143
VWe have training going on in China, in the USA,
p144
aVand many other countries.
p145
aVHow much does it cost?
p146
aV2,800 dollars per species is the average.
p147
aVI think that's cheap, at the price.
p148
aVAnd that gets you all the scientific data
p149
aVthat goes with it.
p150
aVThe future research is "How can we find
p151
aVthe genetic and molecular markers
p152
aVfor the viability of seeds,
p153
aVwithout having to plant them every 10 years?"
p154
aVAnd we're almost there.
p155
aVThank you very much.
