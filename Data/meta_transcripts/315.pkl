VWho are we?
p4
aVThat is the big question.
p5
aVAnd essentially we are just an upright-walking, big-brained,
p6
aVsuper-intelligent ape.
p7
aVThis could be us.
p8
aVWe belong to the family called the Hominidae.
p9
aVWe are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens,
p10
aVand it's important to remember that,
p11
aVin terms of our place in the world today
p12
aVand our future on planet Earth.
p13
aa(lp14
VWe are one species
p15
aVof about five and a half thousand mammalian species
p16
aVthat exist on planet Earth today.
p17
aVAnd that's just a tiny fraction of all species
p18
aVthat have ever lived on the planet in past times.
p19
aVWe're one species out of approximately,
p20
aVor let's say, at least 16 upright-walking apes
p21
aVthat have existed over the past six to eight million years.
p22
aVBut as far as we know, we're the only upright-walking ape
p23
aVthat exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd it's important to remember that,
p26
aVbecause the bonobos are so human,
p27
aVand they share 99 percent of their genes with us.
p28
aVAnd we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes.
p29
aVIt's important to remember that we evolved.
p30
aVNow, I know that's a dirty word for some people,
p31
aVbut we evolved from common ancestors
p32
aVwith the gorillas, the chimpanzee and also the bonobos.
p33
aVWe have a common past, and we have a common future.
p34
aVAnd it is important to remember that all of these great apes
p35
aVhave come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey
p36
aVas we ourselves have today.
p37
aVAnd it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity,
p38
aVand it's this journey that has been the focus
p39
aVof the past three generations of my family,
p40
aVas we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains
p41
aVof our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd this is how we look for them.
p44
aVA group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly
p45
aVout across vast areas of Africa,
p46
aVlooking for small fragments of bone, fossil bone, that may be on the surface.
p47
aVAnd that's an example of what we may do as we walk across
p48
aVthe landscape in Northern Kenya, looking for fossils.
p49
aVI doubt many of you in the audience can see
p50
aVthe fossil that's in this picture,
p51
aVbut if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw,
p52
aVof a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape
p53
aVas it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVIt's extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive
p56
aVand it is something that is going to involve a lot more people,
p57
aVto begin to piece together our past.
p58
aVWe still really haven't got a very complete picture of it.
p59
aa(lp60
VWhen we find a fossil, we mark it.
p61
aVToday, we've got great technology: we have GPS.
p62
aVWe mark it with a GPS fix,
p63
aVand we also take a digital photograph of the specimen,
p64
aVso we could essentially put it back on the surface,
p65
aVexactly where we found it.
p66
aVAnd we can bring all this information into big GIS packages, today.
p67
aVWhen we then find something very important,
p68
aVlike the bones of a human ancestor,
p69
aVwe begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly,
p70
aVusing dental picks and fine paintbrushes.
p71
aVAnd all the sediment is then put through these screens,
p72
aVand where we go again through it very carefully,
p73
aVlooking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed.
p74
aa(lp75
VAnd these things are so exciting. They are so often the only,
p76
aVor the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains.
p77
aVAnd here's a very special moment, when my mother and myself
p78
aVwere digging up some remains of human ancestors.
p79
aVAnd it is one of the most special things
p80
aVto ever do with your mother.
p81
aV(Laughter)
p82
aVNot many people can say that.
p83
aa(lp84
VBut now, let me take you back to Africa, two million years ago.
p85
aVI'd just like to point out, if you look at the map of Africa,
p86
aVit does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape.
p87
aVNow we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley.
p88
aVIt essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden,
p89
aVor runs down to Lake Malawi.
p90
aVAnd the Rift Valley is a depression.
p91
aVIt's a basin, and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin,
p92
aVcarrying sediment, preserving the bones of animals that lived there.
p93
aa(lp94
VIf you want to become a fossil, you actually need to die somewhere
p95
aVwhere your bones will be rapidly buried.
p96
aVYou then hope that the earth moves in such a way
p97
aVas to bring the bones back up to the surface.
p98
aVAnd then you hope that one of us lot
p99
aVwill walk around and find small pieces of you.
p100
aV(Laughter)
p101
aVOK, so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much
p102
aVas we do know today about our ancestors,
p103
aVbecause it's incredibly difficult,
p104
aVA, for these things to become \u2014 to be \u2014 preserved,
p105
aVand secondly, for them to have been brought back up to the surface.
p106
aVAnd we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains,
p107
aVand begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo, let's go to Lake Turkana, which is one such lake basin
p110
aVin the very north of our country, Kenya.
p111
aVAnd if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake
p112
aVthat's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains
p113
aVof the animals that lived there.
p114
aVFossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin,
p115
aVwhich represents some 20,000 square miles.
p116
aVThat's a huge job that we've got on our hands.
p117
aVTwo million years ago at Lake Turkana,
p118
aVHomo erectus, one of our human ancestors,
p119
aVactually lived in this region.
p120
aVYou can see some of the major fossil sites that we've been working
p121
aVin the north. But, essentially, two million years ago,
p122
aVHomo erectus, up in the far right corner,
p123
aVlived alongside three other species of human ancestor.
p124
aVAnd here is a skull of a Homo erectus,
p125
aVwhich I just pulled off the shelf there.
p126
aV(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VBut it is not to say that being a single species on planet Earth is the norm.
p129
aVIn fact, if you go back in time,
p130
aVit is the norm that there are multiple species of hominids
p131
aVor of human ancestors that coexist at any one time.
p132
aVWhere did these things come from?
p133
aVThat's what we're still trying to find answers to,
p134
aVand it is important to realize that there is diversity
p135
aVin all different species, and our ancestors are no exception.
p136
aVHere's some reconstructions of some of the fossils
p137
aVthat have been found from Lake Turkana.
p138
aa(lp139
VBut I was very lucky to have been brought up in Kenya,
p140
aVessentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana
p141
aVin search of human remains.
p142
aVAnd we were able to dig up, when we got old enough,
p143
aVfossils such as this, a slender-snouted crocodile.
p144
aVAnd we dug up giant tortoises, and elephants and things like that.
p145
aVBut when I was 12, as I was in this picture,
p146
aVa very exciting expedition was in place on the west side,
p147
aVwhen they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus.
p148
aa(lp149
VI could relate to this Homo erectus skeleton very well,
p150
aVbecause I was the same age that he was when he died.
p151
aVAnd I imagined him to be tall, dark-skinned.
p152
aVHis brothers certainly were able to run long distances
p153
aVchasing prey, probably sweating heavily as they did so.
p154
aVHe was very able to use stones effectively as tools.
p155
aVAnd this individual himself, this one that I'm holding up here,
p156
aVactually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child.
p157
aVHe had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after
p158
aVquite carefully by other female, and probably much smaller,
p159
aVmembers of his family group, to have got to where he did in life, age 12.
p160
aVUnfortunately for him, he fell into a swamp
p161
aVand couldn't get out.
p162
aVEssentially, his bones were rapidly buried
p163
aVand beautifully preserved.
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd he remained there until 1.6 million years later,
p166
aVwhen this very famous fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu,
p167
aVwalked along a small hillside
p168
aVand found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface
p169
aVamongst the pebbles, recognized it as being hominid.
p170
aVIt's actually this little piece up here on the top.
p171
aVWell, an excavation was begun immediately,
p172
aVand more and more little bits of skull
p173
aVstarted to be extracted from the sediment.
p174
aVAnd what was so fun about it was this:
p175
aVthe skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree,
p176
aVand fairly recently the tree had grown up,
p177
aVbut it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside,
p178
aVand so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this,
p179
aVholding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope.
p180
aVWe began to find limb bones; we found finger bones,
p181
aVthe bones of the pelvis, vertebrae, ribs, the collar bones,
p182
aVthings that had never, ever been seen before in Homo erectus.
p183
aVIt was truly exciting.
p184
aVHe had a body very similar to our own,
p185
aVand he was on the threshold of becoming human.
p186
aa(lp187
VWell, shortly afterwards, members of his species
p188
aVstarted to move northwards out of Africa,
p189
aVand you start to see fossils of Homo erectus
p190
aVin Georgia, China and also in parts of Indonesia.
p191
aVSo, Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa
p192
aVand begin its spread across the globe.
p193
aVSome exciting finds, again, as I mentioned,
p194
aVfrom Dmanisi, in the Republic of Georgia.
p195
aVBut also, surprising finds
p196
aVrecently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia,
p197
aVwhere a group of these human ancestors have been isolated,
p198
aVand have become dwarfed, and they're only about a meter in height.
p199
aVBut they lived only 18,000 years ago,
p200
aVand that is truly extraordinary to think about.
p201
aa(lp202
VJust to put this in terms of generations,
p203
aVbecause people do find it hard to think of time,
p204
aVHomo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago.
p205
aVWe evolved essentially from an African stock.
p206
aVAgain, at about 200,000 years as a fully-fledged us.
p207
aVAnd we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago.
p208
aVAnd until 30,000 years ago, at least three upright-walking apes
p209
aVshared the planet Earth.
p210
aa(lp211
VThe question now is, well, who are we?
p212
aVWe're certainly a polluting, wasteful, aggressive species,
p213
aVwith a few nice things thrown in, perhaps.
p214
aV(Laughter)
p215
aVFor the most part, we're not particularly pleasant at all.
p216
aVWe have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors.
p217
aVIs this a good evolutionary adaptation, or is it going to lead us
p218
aVto being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet Earth?
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd what is it that really makes us us?
p221
aVI think it's our collective intelligence.
p222
aVIt's our ability to write things down,
p223
aVour language and our consciousness.
p224
aVFrom very primitive beginnings, with a very crude tool kit of stones,
p225
aVwe now have a very advanced tool kit, and our tool use
p226
aVhas really reached unprecedented levels:
p227
aVwe've got buggies to Mars; we've mapped the human genome;
p228
aVand recently even created synthetic life, thanks to Craig Venter.
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd we've also managed to communicate with people
p231
aVall over the world, from extraordinary places.
p232
aVEven from within an excavation in northern Kenya,
p233
aVwe can talk to people about what we're doing.
p234
aVAs Al Gore so clearly has reminded us,
p235
aVwe have reached extraordinary numbers
p236
aVof people on this planet.
p237
aVHuman ancestors really only survive on planet Earth,
p238
aVif you look at the fossil record,
p239
aVfor about, on average, a million years at a time.
p240
aVWe've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species,
p241
aVyet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people.
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd last year, our population grew by 80 million.
p244
aVI mean, these are extraordinary numbers.
p245
aVYou can see here, again, taken from Al Gore's book.
p246
aVBut what's happened is our technology
p247
aVhas removed the checks and balances on our population growth.
p248
aVWe have to control our numbers, and I think this is as important
p249
aVas anything else that's being done in the world today.
p250
aVBut we have to control our numbers,
p251
aVbecause we can't really hold it together as a species.
p252
aa(lp253
VMy father so appropriately put it,
p254
aVthat "We are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices
p255
aVthat are bad for our survival as a species."
p256
aVCan we hold it together?
p257
aVIt's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa.
p258
aVWe all have an African origin.
p259
aVWe have a common past and we share a common future.
p260
aVEvolutionarily speaking, we're just a blip.
p261
aVWe're sitting on the edge of a precipice,
p262
aVand we have the tools and the technology at our hands
p263
aVto communicate what needs to be done
p264
aVto hold it together today.
p265
aVWe could tell every single human being out there, if we really wanted to.
p266
aVBut will we do that, or will we just let nature take its course?
p267
aa(lp268
VWell, to end on a very positive note,
p269
aVI think evolutionarily speaking,
p270
aVthis is probably a fairly good thing, in the end.
p271
aVI'll leave it at that, thank you very much.
