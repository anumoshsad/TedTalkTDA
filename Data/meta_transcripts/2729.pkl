VLast year, I got a chance to watch the new "Star Wars" movie,
p4
aVwhich was fantastic,
p5
aVbut one thing kept bugging me.
p6
aVI don't know if you noticed this or not.
p7
aVIn this entirely technically advanced world,
p8
aVI did not see a single AED anywhere,
p9
aVwhich was totally shocking \u2014
p10
aValmost as shocking as not knowing what an AED is,
p11
aVwhich you guys do know.
p12
aVBut for those at home,
p13
aVan AED is an automated external defibrillator.
p14
aVIt's the device you use when your heart goes into cardiac arrest
p15
aVto shock it back into a normal rhythm,
p16
aVor, as one of the guys I was teaching a class to referred to it as:
p17
aV"The shocky-hearty-box thing."
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VBut I really can't blame the Empire,
p22
aVsince health and safety regulations
p23
aVaren't really their first order of business.
p24
aVThough, even if we \u2014
p25
aVI think worse than not having an AED would be if there was one there,
p26
aVbut just, no one knew where to find it.
p27
aVThese devices can drastically increase your chance of survival \u2014
p28
aValmost like a tauntaun on Hoth.
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
VBut I'm pretty sure that stormtrooper is going to be toast,
p33
aVregardless if we have an AED or not,
p34
aVsince what happens is the chest plate is going to be quite hard to get off,
p35
aVand like that tauntaun,
p36
aVthe AED has a very short window of time at which it's highly effective.
p37
aVIn this case \u2014 basically, we've got to use it within the first 10 minutes.
p38
aa(lp39
VThe Jedi, on the other hand, have no problems with their outfits.
p40
aVThose robes open straight up,
p41
aVyou can place the pads right onto the chest \u2014
p42
aVso upper-right-hand side of the chest,
p43
aVlower left,
p44
aVwait for the unit to determine if it's a shockable rhythm
p45
aVand get ready to shock.
p46
aVBut, the Jedi do have a problem.
p47
aVThey have a head appendage issue.
p48
aVAnd so I can be totally clear, thinking I'm ready to go,
p49
aVbut I'm accidentally touching a tentacle
p50
aVand inadvertently shocking myself.
p51
aa(lp52
V(Laughter)
p53
aa(lp54
VSo before you hit that button, make sure you are clear
p55
aVand everyone else is clear.
p56
aa(lp57
VGoing back to that stormtrooper:
p58
aVIf I did get that chest plate off in time,
p59
aVwhat would you do if you suddenly found there was a Wookiee under there,
p60
aVor possibly two Ewoks?
p61
aa(lp62
V(Laughter)
p63
aa(lp64
VWell, lucky for us,
p65
aVin the kit there's actually a razor,
p66
aVand we can use that to shave the chest on the upper right-hand side
p67
aVand the lower left.
p68
aa(lp69
VWookiees also have another problem.
p70
aVThey have an accessory issue.
p71
aVWhat we want to do is remove these \u2014
p72
aVanything between the two pads we want to remove,
p73
aVsince it can cause something called "arcing."
p74
aVFor those who don't know what arcing is,
p75
aVdo you remember the Emperor,
p76
aVwhen he shoots electricity out the ends of his fingers \u2014
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
Vthat would be kind of like arcing.
p81
aVAnother thing that \u2014
p82
aVOh! By the way, he creates that by wearing wool socks under his robes.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VWe can also get arcing if we have an extremely wet chest.
p87
aVThe electricity travels across the surface instead of through the heart.
p88
aVWe can correct this with the immortal words of Douglas Adams:
p89
aV"Don't panic," which most of us have done today \u2014
p90
aVand also always having a towel.
p91
aVSo, good words to go by.
p92
aa(lp93
VThe metal bikini \u2014 unfortunately, this is where panic sets in \u2014
p94
aVlike the modern bra,
p95
aVwe have to make sure we remove,
p96
aVbecause this can cause severe arcing along with burns.
p97
aVBut unfortunately this opens up an issue
p98
aVthat's almost as controversial as talking about the prequels.
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VThe mere mention of the word "nipples,"
p103
aVand people get into a little bit of a tizzy.
p104
aVBy the way, that is not a nipple, that's a cupcake.
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VChances are, if you do have to use this,
p109
aVthis is going to be on someone you know.
p110
aVAnd remember, everyone has nipples,
p111
aVexcept for Jabba.
p112
aa(lp113
V(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VBut he does love cupcakes.
p116
aVSpeaking about Jabba,
p117
aVif we do have to use an AED on him,
p118
aVremember pad placement is the same,
p119
aVeven though he doesn't have nipples.
p120
aVSo it's going to be upper right-hand side, lower left.
p121
aVIf we were going through, we're shocking, getting ready to go \u2014
p122
aVafter we've done the shock,
p123
aVone of the things we need to do is remember to do compression.
p124
aVThe preferred method is 30 compressions and two breaths
p125
aVin the center of the chest, between the nipples,
p126
aVpressing down at least two inches,
p127
aVno more than two and a half,
p128
aVat a rate of at least 100 beats a minute,
p129
aVno more than 120.
p130
aVUnfortunately, due to the size of Jabba's mouth
p131
aVand also what he puts in said mouth,
p132
aVwe may not want to actually do the mouth-to-mouth part.
p133
aVSo instead, we can do compression-only CPR.
p134
aVThe way of remembering the compression-only part
p135
aVis we can actually use the Imperial March.
p136
aa(lp137
VI would sing it for you \u2014
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VUnfortunately, that would be more something an interrogation droid would do.
p142
aa(lp143
VYoda.
p144
aVSmall little guy, like a baby.
p145
aVWhat we do is basically treat him like a baby,
p146
aVin the sense that we're going to place one pad in the center of the chest
p147
aVand one in the back.
p148
aVIf we place them both in the front,
p149
aVthey can be too close and cause severe arcing,
p150
aVso we want to avoid that.
p151
aa(lp152
VHopefully, this helped to clarify
p153
aVand put some light on some of the darker issues
p154
aVof using an AED in the Star Wars universe,
p155
aVor any universe in total.
p156
aa(lp157
VI'll leave you with one point.
p158
aVRemember, if you do find yourself dealing with a Wookiee,
p159
aVdo not shave the entire Wookiee.
p160
aVThis takes way too much time,
p161
aVand it only pisses them off.
p162
aa(lp163
V(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VThank you very much.
