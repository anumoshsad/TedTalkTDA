VThat was a song based on numerous work songs,
p100
aVand it was arranged by Odetta,
p101
aVa hero of mine.
p102
aVAnd this next song, well,
p103
aVI do a lot of historical music,
p104
aVstarting with the Carolina Chocolate Drops
p105
aVand continuing on in my solo endeavors.
p106
aVAnd I believe that knowing your history as a musician
p107
aVis super important \u2014
p108
aVit's important as a person,
p109
aVit's important as a country,
p110
aVit's important as a people.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo I read a lot about where the music comes from
p113
aVand where this country comes from.
p114
aVI've been reading a lot about the Civil War
p115
aVand about slavery.
p116
aVAnd it's really tough.
p117
aVYou know?
p118
aVIt's really tough reading.
p119
aVAnd so as an artist, what I do with all that emotion,
p120
aVreading these people's stories,
p121
aVnot just, "Oh, slavery was terrible."
p122
aVYes, it was.
p123
aVBut it's reading individual narratives of how it was for these people.
p124
aVYou know?
p125
aVThen it's like, "Yeah, that could've been me."
p126
aVAnd it is people now. You know?
p127
aVSo what you do with all that emotion
p128
aVis you've got to do something with it.
p129
aVAs an artist, I write.
p130
aVSo I wrote a song based on some of those narratives that I read,
p131
aVand it's called, "Come Love Come."
p132
aVWe're going to do it for you now.
