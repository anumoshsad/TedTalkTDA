VWell, now we're going to the Bahamas to meet
p4
aVa remarkable group of dolphins that I've been working with
p5
aVin the wild for the last 28 years.
p6
aa(lp7
VNow I'm interested in dolphins because of their large brains
p8
aVand what they might be doing with all that brainpower
p9
aVin the wild.
p10
aVAnd we know they use some of that brainpower
p11
aVfor just living complicated lives,
p12
aVbut what do we really know about dolphin intelligence?
p13
aa(lp14
VWell, we know a few things.
p15
aVWe know that their brain-to-body ratio,
p16
aVwhich is a physical measure of intelligence,
p17
aVis second only to humans.
p18
aVCognitively, they can understand
p19
aVartificially-created languages.
p20
aVAnd they pass self-awareness tests in mirrors.
p21
aVAnd in some parts of the world, they use tools,
p22
aVlike sponges to hunt fish.
p23
aVBut there's one big question left:
p24
aVdo they have a language, and if so,
p25
aVwhat are they talking about?
p26
aa(lp27
VSo decades ago, not years ago,
p28
aVI set out to find a place in the world
p29
aVwhere I could observe dolphins underwater
p30
aVto try to crack the code of their communication system.
p31
aVNow in most parts of the world, the water's pretty murky,
p32
aVso it's very hard to observe animals underwater,
p33
aVbut I found a community of dolphins that live
p34
aVin these beautiful, clear, shallow sandbanks of the Bahamas
p35
aVwhich are just east of Florida.
p36
aVAnd they spend their daytime resting and socializing
p37
aVin the safety of the shallows, but at night,
p38
aVthey go off the edge and hunt in deep water.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow, it's not a bad place to be a researcher, either.
p41
aVSo we go out for about five months every summer
p42
aVin a 20-meter catamaran, and we live, sleep and work
p43
aVat sea for weeks at a time.
p44
aVMy main tool is an underwater video with a hydrophone,
p45
aVwhich is an underwater microphone, and this is so
p46
aVI can correlate sound and behavior.
p47
aVAnd most of our work's pretty non-invasive.
p48
aVWe try to follow dolphin etiquette while we're in the water,
p49
aVsince we're actually observing them physically in the water.
p50
aVNow, Atlantic spotted dolphins are a really nice species
p51
aVto work with for a couple of reasons.
p52
aVThey're born without spots, and they get spots with age,
p53
aVand they go through pretty distinct developmental phases,
p54
aVso that's fun to track their behavior.
p55
aVAnd by about the age of 15, they're fully spotted black and white.
p56
aa(lp57
VNow the mother you see here is Mugsy.
p58
aVShe's 35 years old in this shot,
p59
aVbut dolphins can actually live into their early 50s.
p60
aVAnd like all the dolphins in our community,
p61
aVwe photographed Mugsy and tracked her little spots
p62
aVand nicks in her dorsal fin,
p63
aVand also the unique spot patterns
p64
aVas she matured over time.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, young dolphins learn a lot as they're growing up,
p67
aVand they use their teenage years to practice social skills,
p68
aVand at about the age of nine, the females
p69
aVbecome sexually mature, so they can get pregnant,
p70
aVand the males mature quite a bit later,
p71
aVat around 15 years of age.
p72
aVAnd dolphins are very promiscuous,
p73
aVand so we have to determine who the fathers are,
p74
aVso we do paternity tests by collecting fecal material
p75
aVout of the water and extracting DNA.
p76
aVSo what that means is, after 28 years,
p77
aVwe are tracking three generations,
p78
aVincluding grandmothers and grandfathers.
p79
aVNow, dolphins are natural acousticians.
p80
aVThey make sounds 10 times as high
p81
aVand hear sounds 10 times as high as we do.
p82
aVBut they have other communication signals they use.
p83
aVThey have good vision, so they use body postures to communicate.
p84
aVThey have taste, not smell.
p85
aVAnd they have touch.
p86
aVAnd sound can actually be felt in the water,
p87
aVbecause the acoustic impedance of tissue and water's about the same.
p88
aVSo dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance.
p89
aa(lp90
VNow, we do know some things about how sounds are used
p91
aVwith certain behaviors.
p92
aVNow, the signature whistle is a whistle
p93
aVthat's specific to an individual dolphin, and it's like a name. (Dolphin whistling noises)
p94
aVAnd this is the best-studied sound,
p95
aVbecause it's easy to measure, really,
p96
aVand you'd find this whistle when mothers and calves
p97
aVare reuniting, for example.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnother well studied sound are echolocation clicks.
p100
aVThis is the dolphin's sonar. (Dolphin echolocation noises)
p101
aVAnd they use these clicks to hunt and feed.
p102
aVBut they can also tightly pack these clicks together
p103
aVinto buzzes and use them socially.
p104
aVFor example, males will stimulate a female
p105
aVduring a courtship chase.
p106
aVYou know, I've been buzzed in the water.
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aVDon't tell anyone. It's a secret.
p109
aVAnd you can really feel the sound. That was my point with that.
p110
aV(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VSo dolphins are also political animals,
p113
aVso they have to resolve conflicts.
p114
aV(Dolphin noises)
p115
aVAnd they use these burst-pulsed sounds as well as
p116
aVtheir head-to-head behaviors when they're fighting.
p117
aVAnd these are very unstudied sounds
p118
aVbecause they're hard to measure.
p119
aa(lp120
VNow this is some video of a typical dolphin fight.
p121
aV(Dolphin noises)
p122
aVSo you're going to see two groups,
p123
aVand you're going to see the head-to-head posturing,
p124
aVsome open mouths,
p125
aVlots of squawking.
p126
aVThere's a bubble.
p127
aVAnd basically, one of these groups will kind of back off
p128
aVand everything will resolve fine,
p129
aVand it doesn't really escalate into violence too much.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow, in the Bahamas, we also have resident bottlenose
p132
aVthat interact socially with the spotted dolphins.
p133
aVFor example, they babysit each other's calves.
p134
aVThe males have dominance displays that they use
p135
aVwhen they're chasing each other's females.
p136
aVAnd the two species actually form temporary alliances
p137
aVwhen they're chasing sharks away.
p138
aVAnd one of the mechanisms they use to communicate
p139
aVtheir coordination is synchrony.
p140
aVThey synchronize their sounds and their body postures
p141
aVto look bigger and sound stronger.
p142
aV(Dolphins noises)
p143
aVNow, these are bottlenose dolphins,
p144
aVand you'll see them starting to synchronize
p145
aVtheir behavior and their sounds.
p146
aV(Dolphin noises)
p147
aVYou see, they're synchronizing with their partner
p148
aVas well as the other dyad.
p149
aVI wish I was that coordinated.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow, it's important to remember that you're only hearing
p152
aVthe human-audible parts of dolphin sounds,
p153
aVand dolphins make ultrasonic sounds,
p154
aVand we use special equipment in the water
p155
aVto collect these sounds.
p156
aVNow, researchers have actually measured whistle complexity
p157
aVusing information theory,
p158
aVand whistles rate very high relative to even human languages.
p159
aVBut burst-pulsed sounds is a bit of a mystery.
p160
aa(lp161
VNow, these are three spectragrams.
p162
aVTwo are human words, and one is a dolphin vocalizing.
p163
aVSo just take a guess in your mind which one is the dolphin.
p164
aVNow, it turns out burst-pulsed sounds actually look
p165
aVa bit like human phonemes.
p166
aa(lp167
VNow, one way to crack the code
p168
aVis to interpret these signals and figure out what they mean,
p169
aVbut it's a difficult job, and we actually don't have a Rosetta Stone yet.
p170
aVBut a second way to crack the code
p171
aVis to develop some technology,
p172
aVan interface to do two-way communication,
p173
aVand that's what we've been trying to do in the Bahamas
p174
aVand in real time.
p175
aVNow, scientists have used keyboard interfaces
p176
aVto try to bridge the gap with species
p177
aVincluding chimpanzees and dolphins.
p178
aVThis underwater keyboard in Orlando, Florida,
p179
aVat the Epcot Center, was actually
p180
aVthe most sophisticated ever two-way interface designed
p181
aVfor humans and dolphins to work together under the water
p182
aVand exchange information.
p183
aVSo we wanted to develop an interface like this
p184
aVin the Bahamas, but in a more natural setting.
p185
aVAnd one of the reasons we thought we could do this
p186
aVis because the dolphins were starting to show us
p187
aVa lot of mutual curiosity.
p188
aVThey were spontaneously mimicking our vocalizations
p189
aVand our postures, and they were also inviting us
p190
aVinto dolphin games.
p191
aVNow, dolphins are social mammals, so they love to play,
p192
aVand one of their favorite games is to drag seaweed,
p193
aVor sargassum in this case, around.
p194
aVAnd they're very adept. They like to drag it
p195
aVand drop it from appendage to appendage.
p196
aVNow in this footage, the adult is Caroh.
p197
aVShe's 25 years old here, and this is her newborn, Cobalt,
p198
aVand he's just learning how to play this game.
p199
aV(Dolphin noises)
p200
aVShe's kind of teasing him and taunting him.
p201
aVHe really wants that sargassum.
p202
aVNow, when dolphins solicit humans for this game,
p203
aVthey'll often sink vertically in the water,
p204
aVand they'll have a little sargassum on their flipper,
p205
aVand they'll sort of nudge it and drop it sometimes
p206
aVon the bottom and let us go get it,
p207
aVand then we'll have a little seaweed keep away game.
p208
aVBut when we don't dive down and get it,
p209
aVthey'll bring it to the surface
p210
aVand they'll sort of wave it in front of us on their tail
p211
aVand drop it for us like they do their calves,
p212
aVand then we'll pick it up and have a game.
p213
aa(lp214
VAnd so we started thinking, well, wouldn't it be neat
p215
aVto build some technology that would allow the dolphins
p216
aVto request these things in real time, their favorite toys?
p217
aVSo the original vision was to have a keyboard
p218
aVhanging from the boat attached to a computer,
p219
aVand the divers and dolphins would activate the keys
p220
aVon the keypad and happily exchange information
p221
aVand request toys from each other.
p222
aVBut we quickly found out that dolphins simply
p223
aVwere not going to hang around the boat using a keyboard.
p224
aVThey've got better things to do in the wild.
p225
aVThey might do it in captivity, but in the wild \u2014
p226
aa(lp227
VSo we built a portable keyboard that we could push through the water,
p228
aVand we labeled four objects they like to play with,
p229
aVthe scarf, rope, sargassum, and also had a bow ride,
p230
aVwhich is a fun activity for a dolphin. (Whistle)
p231
aVAnd that's the scarf whistle,
p232
aVwhich is also associated with a visual symbol.
p233
aVAnd these are artificially created whistles.
p234
aVThey're outside the dolphin's normal repertoire,
p235
aVbut they're easily mimicked by the dolphins.
p236
aVAnd I spent four years with my colleagues Adam Pack and Fabienne Delfour,
p237
aVworking out in the field with this keyboard
p238
aVusing it with each other to do requests for toys
p239
aVwhile the dolphins were watching.
p240
aVAnd the dolphins could get in on the game.
p241
aVThey could point at the visual object,
p242
aVor they could mimic the whistle.
p243
aa(lp244
VNow this is video of a session.
p245
aVThe diver here has a rope toy,
p246
aVand I'm on the keyboard on the left,
p247
aVand I've just played the rope key,
p248
aVand that's the request for the toy from the human.
p249
aVSo I've got the rope, I'm diving down,
p250
aVand I'm basically trying to get the dolphin's attention,
p251
aVbecause they're kind of like little kids.
p252
aVYou have to keep their attention.
p253
aVI'm going to drop the rope, see if they come over.
p254
aVHere they come,
p255
aVand then they're going to pick up the rope
p256
aVand drag it around as a toy.
p257
aVNow, I'm at the keyboard on the left,
p258
aVand this is actually the first time that we tried this.
p259
aVI'm going to try to request this toy, the rope toy,
p260
aVfrom the dolphins using the rope sound.
p261
aVLet's see if they might actually understand what that means.
p262
aV(Whistle)
p263
aVThat's the rope whistle.
p264
aVUp come the dolphins,
p265
aVand drop off the rope, yay. Wow.
p266
aa(lp267
V(Applause)
p268
aa(lp269
VSo this is only once.
p270
aVWe don't know for sure if they really understand the function of the whistles.
p271
aVOkay, so here's a second toy in the water.
p272
aVThis is a scarf toy, and I'm trying to lead the dolphin
p273
aVover to the keyboard to show her
p274
aVthe visual and the acoustic signal.
p275
aVNow this dolphin, we call her "the scarf thief,"
p276
aVbecause over the years she's absconded
p277
aVwith about 12 scarves.
p278
aVIn fact, we think she has a boutique somewhere in the Bahamas.
p279
aVSo I'm reaching over. She's got the scarf on her right side.
p280
aVAnd we try to not touch the animals too much,
p281
aVwe really don't want to over-habituate them.
p282
aVAnd I'm trying to lead her back to the keyboard.
p283
aVAnd the diver there is going to activate the scarf sound
p284
aVto request the scarf.
p285
aVSo I try to give her the scarf.
p286
aVWhoop. Almost lost it.
p287
aVBut this is the moment where everything becomes possible.
p288
aVThe dolphin's at the keyboard.
p289
aVYou've got full attention.
p290
aVAnd this sometimes went on for hours.
p291
aVAnd I wanted to share this video with you
p292
aVnot to show you any big breakthroughs,
p293
aVbecause they haven't happened yet,
p294
aVbut to show you the level of intention and focus
p295
aVthat these dolphins have, and interest in the system.
p296
aa(lp297
VAnd because of this, we really decided we needed
p298
aVsome more sophisticated technology.
p299
aVSo we joined forces with Georgia Tech,
p300
aVwith Thad Starner's wearable computing group,
p301
aVto build us an underwater wearable computer
p302
aVthat we're calling CHAT. [CHAT: Cetacean Hearing And Telemetry]
p303
aVNow, instead of pushing a keyboard through the water,
p304
aVthe diver's wearing the complete system, and it's acoustic only,
p305
aVso basically the diver activates the sounds on a keypad
p306
aVon the forearm,
p307
aVthe sounds go out through an underwater speaker,
p308
aVif a dolphin mimics the whistle
p309
aVor a human plays the whistle, the sounds come in
p310
aVand are localized by two hydrophones.
p311
aVThe computer can localize who requested the toy
p312
aVif there's a word match.
p313
aVAnd the real power of the system is in the real-time
p314
aVsound recognition, so we can respond to the dolphins
p315
aVquickly and accurately.
p316
aa(lp317
VAnd we're at prototype stage, but this is how we hope it will play out.
p318
aVSo Diver A and Diver B both have a wearable computer
p319
aVand the dolphin hears the whistle as a whistle,
p320
aVthe diver hears the whistle as a whistle in the water,
p321
aVbut also as a word through bone conduction.
p322
aVSo Diver A plays the scarf whistle
p323
aVor Diver B plays the sargassum whistle
p324
aVto request a toy from whoever has it.
p325
aVWhat we hope will happen is that the dolphin mimics the whistle,
p326
aVand if Diver A has the sargassum, if that's the sound
p327
aVthat was played and requested,
p328
aVthen the diver will give the sargassum to the requesting dolphin
p329
aVand they'll swim away happily into the sunset
p330
aVplaying sargassum for forever.
p331
aa(lp332
VNow, how far can this kind of communication go?
p333
aVWell, CHAT is designed specifically to empower the dolphins
p334
aVto request things from us.
p335
aVIt's designed to really be two-way.
p336
aVNow, will they learn to mimic the whistles functionally?
p337
aVWe hope so and we think so.
p338
aVBut as we decode their natural sounds,
p339
aVwe're also planning to put those back into the computerized system.
p340
aVFor example, right now we can put their own signature whistles
p341
aVin the computer and request to interact with a specific dolphin.
p342
aVLikewise, we can create our own whistles,
p343
aVour own whistle names, and let the dolphins
p344
aVrequest specific divers to interact with.
p345
aa(lp346
VNow it may be that all our mobile technology
p347
aVwill actually be the same technology that helps us
p348
aVcommunicate with another species down the road.
p349
aVIn the case of a dolphin, you know, it's a species that,
p350
aVwell, they're probably close to our intelligence in many ways
p351
aVand we might not be able to admit that right now,
p352
aVbut they live in quite a different environment,
p353
aVand you still have to bridge the gap with the sensory systems.
p354
aa(lp355
VI mean, imagine what it would be like
p356
aVto really understand the mind
p357
aVof another intelligent species on the planet.
p358
aa(lp359
VThank you.
