VSo this is a story
p4
aVof a place that I now call home.
p5
aVIt's a story of public education
p6
aVand of rural communities
p7
aVand of what design might do to improve both.
p8
aVSo this is Bertie County,
p9
aVNorth Carolina, USA.
p10
aVTo give you an idea of the "where:"
p11
aVSo here's North Carolina, and if we zoom in,
p12
aVBertie County is in the eastern part of the state.
p13
aVIt's about two hours east
p14
aVdriving-time from Raleigh.
p15
aVAnd it's very flat. It's very swampy.
p16
aVIt's mostly farmland.
p17
aVThe entire county
p18
aVis home to just 20,000 people, and they're very sparsely distributed.
p19
aVSo there's only 27 people per square mile,
p20
aVwhich comes down to about 10 people
p21
aVper square kilometer.
p22
aa(lp23
VBertie County is kind of a prime example
p24
aVin the demise of rural America.
p25
aVWe've seen this story all over the country
p26
aVand even in places beyond the American borders.
p27
aVWe know the symptoms.
p28
aVIt's the hollowing out of small towns.
p29
aVIt's downtowns becoming ghost towns.
p30
aVThe brain drain \u2014
p31
aVwhere all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back.
p32
aVIt's the dependence on farm subsidies
p33
aVand under-performing schools
p34
aVand higher poverty rates in rural areas
p35
aVthan in urban.
p36
aVAnd Bertie County is no exception to this.
p37
aVPerhaps the biggest thing it struggles with,
p38
aVlike many communities similar to it,
p39
aVis that there's no
p40
aVshared, collective investment
p41
aVin the future of rural communities.
p42
aVOnly 6.8 percent of all our philanthropic giving in the U.S. right now
p43
aVbenefits rural communities,
p44
aVand yet 20 percent of our population lives there.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo Bertie County is not only very rural; it's incredibly poor.
p47
aVIt is the poorest county in the state.
p48
aVIt has one in three of its children living in poverty,
p49
aVand it's what is referred to as a "rural ghetto."
p50
aVThe economy is mostly agricultural.
p51
aVThe biggest crops are cotton and tobacco,
p52
aVand we're very proud of our Bertie County peanut.
p53
aVThe biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant.
p54
aVThe county seat is Windsor.
p55
aVThis is like Times Square of Windsor that you're looking at right now.
p56
aVIt's home to only 2,000 people,
p57
aVand like a lot of other small towns
p58
aVit has been hollowed out over the years.
p59
aVThere are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair
p60
aVthan occupied and in use.
p61
aVYou can count the number of restaurants in the county
p62
aVon one hand \u2014
p63
aVBunn's Barbecue being my absolute favorite.
p64
aVBut in the whole county there is no coffee shop,
p65
aVthere's no Internet cafe,
p66
aVthere's no movie theater, there's no bookstore.
p67
aVThere isn't even a Walmart.
p68
aa(lp69
VRacially, the county
p70
aVis about 60 percent African-American,
p71
aVbut what happens in the public schools
p72
aVis most of the privileged white kids
p73
aVgo to the private Lawrence Academy.
p74
aVSo the public school students
p75
aVare about 86 percent African-American.
p76
aVAnd this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class,
p77
aVand you can see the difference is pretty stark.
p78
aVSo to say that the public education system
p79
aVin Bertie County is struggling
p80
aVwould be a huge understatement.
p81
aVThere's basically no pool
p82
aVof qualified teachers to pull from,
p83
aVand only eight percent of the people in the county
p84
aVhave a bachelor's degree or higher.
p85
aVSo there isn't a big legacy
p86
aVin the pride of education.
p87
aVIn fact, two years ago,
p88
aVonly 27 percent of all the third- through eighth-graders
p89
aVwere passing the state standard
p90
aVin both English and math.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo it sounds like I'm painting a really bleak picture of this place,
p93
aVbut I promise there is good news.
p94
aVThe biggest asset, in my opinion,
p95
aVone of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man:
p96
aVThis is Dr. Chip Zullinger,
p97
aVfondly known as Dr. Z.
p98
aVHe was brought in in October 2007
p99
aVas the new superintendent
p100
aVto basically fix this broken school system.
p101
aVAnd he previously was a superintendent
p102
aVin Charleston, South Carolina
p103
aVand then in Denver, Colorado.
p104
aVHe started some of the country's first charter schools
p105
aVin the late '80s in the U.S.
p106
aVAnd he is an absolute renegade and a visionary,
p107
aVand he is the reason that I now live and work there.
p108
aVSo in February of 2009,
p109
aVDr. Zullinger invited us, Project H Design \u2014
p110
aVwhich is a non-profit design firm that I founded \u2014
p111
aVto come to Bertie and to partner with him
p112
aVon the repair of this school district
p113
aVand to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district.
p114
aVAnd he invited us in particular
p115
aVbecause we have a very specific
p116
aVtype of design process \u2014
p117
aVone that results in appropriate design solutions
p118
aVin places that don't usually have access
p119
aVto design services or creative capital.
p120
aVSpecifically, we use these six design directives,
p121
aVprobably the most important being number two:
p122
aVwe design with, not for \u2014
p123
aVin that, when we're doing humanitarian-focused design,
p124
aVit's not about designing for clients anymore.
p125
aVIt's about designing with people,
p126
aVand letting appropriate solutions emerge from within.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo at the time of being invited down there,
p129
aVwe were based in San Francisco,
p130
aVand so we were going back and forth
p131
aVfor basically the rest of 2009,
p132
aVspending about half our time in Bertie County.
p133
aVAnd when I say we, I mean Project H,
p134
aVbut more specifically, I mean myself and my partner, Matthew Miller,
p135
aVwho's an architect and a sort of MacGyver-type builder.
p136
aVSo fast-forward to today, and we now live there.
p137
aVI have strategically cut Matt's head out of this photo,
p138
aVbecause he would kill me if he knew I was using it
p139
aVbecause of the sweatsuits.
p140
aVBut this is our front porch. We live there.
p141
aVWe now call this place home.
p142
aVOver the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth,
p143
aVwe realized we had fallen in love with the place.
p144
aVWe had fallen in love with the place and the people
p145
aVand the work that we're able to do
p146
aVin a rural place like Bertie County,
p147
aVthat, as designers and builders,
p148
aVyou can't do everywhere.
p149
aVThere's space to experiment
p150
aVand to weld and to test things.
p151
aVWe have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger.
p152
aVThere's a nobility of real, hands-on,
p153
aVdirt-under-your-fingernails work.
p154
aa(lp155
VBut beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there,
p156
aVthere is a huge need.
p157
aVThere is a total vacuum of creative capital in Bertie County.
p158
aVThere isn't a single licensed architect in the whole county.
p159
aVAnd so we saw an opportunity
p160
aVto bring design as this untouched tool,
p161
aVsomething that Bertie County didn't otherwise have,
p162
aVand to be sort of the \u2014 to usher that in
p163
aVas a new type of tool in their tool kit.
p164
aVThe initial goal became using design
p165
aVwithin the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger \u2014
p166
aVthat was why we were there.
p167
aVBut beyond that, we recognized
p168
aVthat Bertie County, as a community,
p169
aVwas in dire need of a fresh perspective
p170
aVof pride and connectedness
p171
aVand of the creative capital
p172
aVthat they were so much lacking.
p173
aVSo the goal became, yes, to apply design within education,
p174
aVbut then to figure out how to make education
p175
aVa great vehicle for community development.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo in order to do this, we've taken three different approaches
p178
aVto the intersection of design and education.
p179
aVAnd I should say that these are three things that we've done in Bertie County,
p180
aVbut I feel pretty confident that they could work
p181
aVin a lot of other rural communities
p182
aVaround the U.S. and maybe even beyond.
p183
aVSo the first of the three is design for education.
p184
aVThis is the most kind of direct, obvious
p185
aVintersection of the two things.
p186
aVIt's the physical construction
p187
aVof improved spaces and materials and experiences
p188
aVfor teachers and students.
p189
aVThis is in response to the awful mobile trailers
p190
aVand the outdated textbooks
p191
aVand the terrible materials that we're building schools out of these days.
p192
aVAnd so this played out for us in a couple different ways.
p193
aVThe first was a series of renovations of computer labs.
p194
aVSo traditionally, the computer labs,
p195
aVparticularly in an under-performing school like Bertie County,
p196
aVwhere they have to benchmark test every other week,
p197
aVthe computer lab is a kill-and-drill
p198
aVtesting facility.
p199
aVYou come in, you face the wall, you take your test and you leave.
p200
aVSo we wanted to change the way that students approach technology,
p201
aVto create a more convivial and social space
p202
aVthat was more engaging, more accessible,
p203
aVand also to increase the ability for teachers
p204
aVto use these spaces for technology-based instruction.
p205
aVSo this is the lab at the high school,
p206
aVand the principal there is in love with this room.
p207
aVEvery time he has visitors, it's the first place that he takes them.
p208
aa(lp209
VAnd this also meant the co-creation with some teachers
p210
aVof this educational playground system
p211
aVcalled the learning landscape.
p212
aVIt allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects
p213
aVthrough game play and activity
p214
aVand running around and screaming and being a kid.
p215
aVSo this game that the kids are playing here \u2014
p216
aVin this case they were learning basic multiplication
p217
aVthrough a game called Match Me.
p218
aVAnd in Match Me, you take the class, divide it into two teams,
p219
aVone team on each side of the playground,
p220
aVand the teacher will take a piece of chalk
p221
aVand just write a number on each of the tires.
p222
aVAnd then she'll call out a math problem \u2014
p223
aVso let's say four times four \u2014
p224
aVand then one student from each team has to compete
p225
aVto figure out that four times four is 16
p226
aVand find the tire with the 16 on it and sit on it.
p227
aVSo the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires
p228
aVand then your team wins.
p229
aVAnd the impact of the learning landscape
p230
aVhas been pretty surprising and amazing.
p231
aVSome of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores,
p232
aVa greater comfort level with the material,
p233
aVespecially with the boys,
p234
aVthat in going outside and playing,
p235
aVthey aren't afraid to take on
p236
aVa double-digit multiplication problem \u2014
p237
aVand also that the teachers are able
p238
aVto use these as assessment tools
p239
aVto better gauge how their students
p240
aVare understanding new material.
p241
aVSo with design for education, I think the most important thing
p242
aVis to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers,
p243
aVso that they have the incentive and the desire to use them.
p244
aVSo this is Mr. Perry. He's the assistant superintendent.
p245
aVHe came out for one of our teacher-training days
p246
aVand won like five rounds of Match Me in a row and was very proud of himself.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
VSo the second approach is redesigning education itself.
p251
aVThis is the most complex.
p252
aVIt's a systems-level look
p253
aVat how education is administered
p254
aVand what is being offered and to whom.
p255
aVSo in many cases this is not so much about making change
p256
aVas it is creating the conditions
p257
aVunder which change is possible
p258
aVand the incentive to want to make change,
p259
aVwhich is easier said than done in rural communities
p260
aVand in inside-the-box education systems
p261
aVin rural communities.
p262
aVSo for us, this was a graphic public campaign
p263
aVcalled Connect Bertie.
p264
aVThere are thousands of these blue dots all over the county.
p265
aVAnd this was for a fund that the school district had
p266
aVto put a desktop computer and a broadband Internet connection
p267
aVin every home
p268
aVwith a child in the public school system.
p269
aVRight now I should say,
p270
aVthere are only 10 percent of the houses
p271
aVthat actually have an in-home Internet connection.
p272
aVAnd the only places to get WiFi
p273
aVare in the school buildings, or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint,
p274
aVwhich I find myself squatting outside of a lot.
p275
aVAside from, you know, getting people excited
p276
aVand wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place,
p277
aVit asked the school system
p278
aVto envision how it might become a catalyst
p279
aVfor a more connected community.
p280
aVIt asked them to reach outside of the school walls
p281
aVand to think about how they could play a role
p282
aVin the community's development.
p283
aVSo the first batch of computers
p284
aVare being installed later this summer,
p285
aVand we're helping Dr. Zullinger develop some strategies
p286
aVaround how we might connect the classroom and the home
p287
aVto extend learning beyond the school day.
p288
aa(lp289
VAnd then the third approach, which is what I'm most excited about,
p290
aVwhich is where we are now,
p291
aVis: design as education.
p292
aVSo "design as education" means
p293
aVthat we could actually teach design within public schools,
p294
aVand not design-based learning \u2014
p295
aVnot like "let's learn physics by building a rocket,"
p296
aVbut actually learning design-thinking
p297
aVcoupled with real construction and fabrication skills
p298
aVput towards a local community purpose.
p299
aVIt also means that designers are no longer consultants,
p300
aVbut we're teachers,
p301
aVand we are charged with growing creative capital
p302
aVwithin the next generation.
p303
aVAnd what design offers as an educational framework
p304
aVis an antidote
p305
aVto all of the boring, rigid, verbal instruction
p306
aVthat so many of these school districts are plagued by.
p307
aVIt's hands-on, it's in-your-face,
p308
aVit requires an active engagement,
p309
aVand it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning
p310
aVin real ways.
p311
aVSo we started thinking
p312
aVabout the legacy of shop class
p313
aVand how shop class \u2014 wood and metal shop class in particular \u2014
p314
aVhistorically, has been something
p315
aVintended for kids who aren't going to go to college.
p316
aVIt's a vocational training path.
p317
aVIt's working-class; it's blue-collar.
p318
aVThe projects are things like,
p319
aVlet's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas.
p320
aVAnd in recent decades, a lot of the funding for shop class
p321
aVhas gone away entirely.
p322
aa(lp323
VSo we thought, what if you could bring back shop class,
p324
aVbut this time orient the projects
p325
aVaround things that the community needed,
p326
aVand to infuse shop class
p327
aVwith a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process.
p328
aVSo we took this kind of nebulous idea
p329
aVand have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year
p330
aVon writing this as a one-year curriculum
p331
aVoffered at the high school level to the junior class.
p332
aVAnd so this starts in four weeks,
p333
aVat the end of the summer,
p334
aVand my partner and I, Matthew and I,
p335
aVjust went through the arduous and totally convoluted process
p336
aVof getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it.
p337
aVAnd this is what it looks like.
p338
aa(lp339
VSo over the course of two semesters,
p340
aVthe Fall and the Spring,
p341
aVthe students spend three hours a day every single day
p342
aVin our 4,500 square foot
p343
aVstudio/shop space.
p344
aVAnd during that time, they're doing everything
p345
aVfrom going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need-finding,
p346
aVcoming back into the studio,
p347
aVdoing the brainstorming and design visualization
p348
aVto come up with concepts that might work,
p349
aVand then moving into the shop and actually testing them,
p350
aVbuilding them, prototyping them,
p351
aVfiguring out if they are going to work and refining that.
p352
aVAnd then over the summer, they're offered a summer job.
p353
aVThey're paid as employees of Project H
p354
aVto be the construction crew with us
p355
aVto build these projects in the community.
p356
aVSo the first project, which will be built next summer,
p357
aVis an open-air farmers' market downtown,
p358
aVfollowed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year
p359
aVand home improvements for the elderly in the third year.
p360
aVSo these are real visible projects
p361
aVthat hopefully the students can point to and say,
p362
aV"I built that, and I'm proud of it."
p363
aa(lp364
VSo I want you to meet three of our students.
p365
aVThis is Ryan.
p366
aVShe is 15 years old.
p367
aVShe loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher.
p368
aVShe wants to go to college, but she wants to come back to Bertie County,
p369
aVbecause that's where her family is from, where she calls home,
p370
aVand she feels very strongly about giving back
p371
aVto this place that she's been fairly fortunate in.
p372
aVSo what Studio H might offer her
p373
aVis a way to develop skills
p374
aVso that she might give back in the most meaningful way.
p375
aa(lp376
VThis is Eric. He plays for the football team.
p377
aVHe is really into dirtbike racing,
p378
aVand he wants to be an architect.
p379
aVSo for him, Studio H offers him
p380
aVa way to develop the skills he will need as an architect,
p381
aVeverything from drafting to wood and metal construction
p382
aVto how to do research for a client.
p383
aa(lp384
VAnd then this is Anthony.
p385
aVHe is 16 years old, loves hunting and fishing and being outside
p386
aVand doing anything with his hands,
p387
aVand so for him, Studio H means
p388
aVthat he can stay interested in his education
p389
aVthrough that hands-on engagement.
p390
aVHe's interested in forestry, but he isn't sure,
p391
aVso if he ends up not going to college,
p392
aVhe will have developed some industry-relevant skills.
p393
aa(lp394
VWhat design and building really offers to public education
p395
aVis a different kind of classroom.
p396
aVSo this building downtown,
p397
aVwhich may very well become the site of our future farmers' market,
p398
aVis now the classroom.
p399
aVAnd going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors
p400
aVabout what kind of food they buy
p401
aVand from where and why \u2014
p402
aVthat's a homework assignment.
p403
aVAnd the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer
p404
aVwhen they have built the farmers' market and it's open to the public \u2014
p405
aVthat's the final exam.
p406
aVAnd for the community, what design and building offers
p407
aVis real, visible, built progress.
p408
aVIt's one project per year,
p409
aVand it makes the youth the biggest asset
p410
aVand the biggest untapped resource
p411
aVin imagining a new future.
p412
aa(lp413
VSo we recognize that Studio H, especially in its first year,
p414
aVis a small story \u2014
p415
aV13 students, it's two teachers,
p416
aVit's one project in one place.
p417
aVBut we feel like this could work in other places.
p418
aVAnd I really, strongly believe in the power of the small story,
p419
aVbecause it is so difficult
p420
aVto do humanitarian work at a global scale.
p421
aVBecause, when you zoom out that far,
p422
aVyou lose the ability to view people as humans.
p423
aa(lp424
VUltimately, design itself is a process
p425
aVof constant education
p426
aVfor the people that we work with and for
p427
aVand for us as designers.
p428
aVAnd let's face it, designers, we need to reinvent ourselves.
p429
aVWe need to re-educate ourselves around the things that matter,
p430
aVwe need to work outside of our comfort zones more,
p431
aVand we need to be better citizens in our own backyard.
p432
aVSo while this is a very small story,
p433
aVwe hope that it represents a step in the right direction
p434
aVfor the future of rural communities
p435
aVand for the future of public education
p436
aVand hopefully also for the future of design.
p437
