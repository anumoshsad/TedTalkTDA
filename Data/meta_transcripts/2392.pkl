aa(lp58

p59
aVThis is like a little payback or something
p60
aVfor 50 million people calling me the loser.
p61
aa(lp62
VNP: Hold up, hold up.
p63
aVBut a lot of people out there don't really know what beatboxing is,
p64
aVwhere it started from.
p65
aa(lp66
VEC: Right, right.
p67
aa(lp68
VNP: Where it came from.
p69
aVSo why don't you give them a little history \u2014
p70
aVjust a tickle \u2014 a bit of history of where it comes from.
p71
aa(lp72
VEC: Beatbox started here in New York.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Cheers)
p75
aa(lp76
VThat's right, that's right. New York, New York!
p77
aVEverybody like, "Yeah!"

aVWell, we from St. Louis.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VNP: Now you can put y'all hands down.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VEC: But beatbox started here in New York.
p87
aVWhat you would have is that, when we would go to parties,
p88
aVyou would have the DJ and you would have the rapper.
p89
aVBut because I don't have electricity coming out of me,
p90
aVwe had to emulate what the beats was doing.
p91
aVSo when you would see the beatboxer,
p92
aVyou would see us over to the side.
p93
aVThen you would see a rapper, and when the rapper began to rap,
p94
aVwe would do a simple beat,
p95
aVbecause back then the beats were simple \u2014
p96
aa(lp97
V(Beatboxing)
p98
aa(lp99
Vor \u2014
p100
aa(lp101
V(Beatboxing)
p102
aa(lp103
VThose were simple beats.
p104
aVBut now, you got folks that want to do all type of stuff
p105
aVwith their beats now,
p106
aVand they want to humiliate their father,
p107
aVwhich is not right when you want to humiliate the person
p108
aVthat take care of you, pay all your tuition, (Nicole laughs)
p109
aVespecially when you have 50 million people
p110
aVthat just go around and call you "the loser."
p111
aVWell, I'm taking that to heart.
p112
aVBut now we do something different in our house,
p113
aVso we have these jam sessions,
p114
aVand our jam sessions consist of us jamming in church.
p115
aVYou know, in church, we'll look at each other like,
p116
aa(lp117
V(Beatboxing)
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
Vand we'll text the beat to each other.
p122
aVOr we'll be in the kitchen cooking,
p123
aVroad trips, airports.
p124
aa(lp125
