V(Applause)
p4
aa(lp5
VThank you very much.
p6
aVI have a few pictures,
p7
aVand I'll talk a little bit about how I'm able to do what I do.
p8
aVAll these houses are built
p9
aVfrom between 70 and 80 percent recycled material,
p10
aVstuff that was headed to the mulcher, the landfill, the burn pile.
p11
aVIt was all just gone.
p12
aVThis is the first house I built.
p13
aVThis double front door here with the three-light transom,
p14
aVthat was headed to the landfill.
p15
aVHave a little turret there.
p16
aVAnd then these buttons on the corbels here \u2014
p17
aVright there \u2014
p18
aVthose are hickory nuts.
p19
aVAnd these buttons there \u2014
p20
aVthose are chicken eggs.
p21
aa(lp22
V(Laughter)
p23
aa(lp24
VOf course, first you have breakfast,
p25
aVand then you fill the shell full of Bondo and paint it and nail it up,
p26
aVand you have an architectural button in just a fraction of the time.
p27
aa(lp28
VThis is a look at the inside.
p29
aVYou can see the three-light transom there with the eyebrow windows.
p30
aVCertainly an architectural antique headed to the landfill \u2014
p31
aVeven the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars.
p32
aVEverything in the kitchen was salvaged.
p33
aVThere's a 1952 O'Keefe & Merritt stove,
p34
aVif you like to cook \u2014 cool stove.
p35
aVThis is going up into the turret.
p36
aVI got that staircase for 20 dollars,
p37
aVincluding delivery to my lot.
p38
aa(lp39
V(Laughter)
p40
aa(lp41
VThen, looking up in the turret,
p42
aVyou see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth.
p43
aVWell, if that ruins your life,
p44
aVwell, then, you shouldn't live there.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VThis is a laundry chute.
p49
aVAnd this right here is a shoe last \u2014
p50
aVthose are those cast-iron things you see at antique shops.
p51
aVSo I had one of those,
p52
aVso I made some low-tech gadgetry, where you just stomp on the shoe last,
p53
aVand then the door flies open and you throw your laundry down.
p54
aVAnd then if you're smart enough, it goes on a basket on top of the washer.
p55
aVIf not, it goes into the toilet.
p56
aa(lp57
V(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VThis is a bathtub I made,
p60
aVmade out of scrap two-by-four.
p61
aVStarted with the rim, and then glued and nailed it up into a flat,
p62
aVcorbeled it up and flipped it over,
p63
aVthen did the two profiles on this side.
p64
aVIt's a two-person tub.
p65
aVAfter all, it's not just a question of hygiene,
p66
aVbut there's a possibility of recreation as well.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VThen, this faucet here is just a piece of Osage orange.
p71
aVIt looks a little phallic,
p72
aVbut after all, it's a bathroom.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VThis is a house based on a Budweiser can.
p77
aVIt doesn't look like a can of beer,
p78
aVbut the design take-offs are absolutely unmistakable:
p79
aVthe barley hops design worked up into the eaves,
p80
aVthen the dentil work comes directly off the can's red, white, blue and silver.
p81
aVThen, these corbels going down underneath the eaves
p82
aVare that little design that comes off the can.
p83
aVI just put a can on a copier and kept enlarging it
p84
aVuntil I got the size I want.
p85
aVThen, on the can it says,
p86
aV"This is the famous Budweiser beer,
p87
aVwe know of no other beer, blah, blah, blah."
p88
aVSo we changed that and put,
p89
aV"This is the famous Budweiser house. We don't know of any other house ..."
p90
aVand so forth and so on.
p91
aVThis is a deadbolt.
p92
aVIt's a fence from a 1930s shaper, which is a very angry woodworking machine.
p93
aVAnd they gave me the fence, but they didn't give me the shaper,
p94
aVso we made a deadbolt out of it.
p95
aVThat'll keep bull elephants out, I promise.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd sure enough, we've had no problems with bull elephants.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VThe shower is intended to simulate a glass of beer.
p104
aVWe've got bubbles going up there, then suds at the top with lumpy tiles.
p105
aVWhere do you get lumpy tiles? Well, of course, you don't.
p106
aVBut I get a lot of toilets, and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer,
p107
aVand then you have lumpy tiles.
p108
aVAnd then the faucet is a beer tap.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VThen, this panel of glass is the same panel of glass
p113
aVthat occurs in every middle-class front door in America.
p114
aVWe're getting tired of it. It's kind of clichéd now.
p115
aVIf you put it in the front door, your design fails.
p116
aVSo don't put it in the front door; put it somewhere else.
p117
aVIt's a pretty panel of glass.
p118
aVBut if you put it in the front door,
p119
aVpeople say, "Oh, you're trying to be like those guys,
p120
aVand you didn't make it."
p121
aVSo don't put it there.
p122
aVThen, another bathroom upstairs.
p123
aVThis light up here
p124
aVis the same light that occurs in every middle-class foyer in America.
p125
aVDon't put it in the foyer.
p126
aVPut it in the shower, or in the closet,
p127
aVbut not in the foyer.
p128
aVThen, somebody gave me a bidet, so it got a bidet.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VThis little house here,
p133
aVthose branches there are made out of Bois d'arc or Osage orange.
p134
aVThese pictures will keep scrolling as I talk a little bit.
p135
aa(lp136
VIn order to do what I do,
p137
aVyou have to understand what causes waste in the building industry.
p138
aVOur housing has become a commodity,
p139
aVand I'll talk a little bit about that.
p140
aVBut the first cause of waste is probably even buried in our DNA.
p141
aVHuman beings have a need for maintaining consistency
p142
aVof the apperceptive mass.
p143
aVWhat does that mean?
p144
aVWhat it means is, for every perception we have,
p145
aVit needs to tally with the one like it before,
p146
aVor we don't have continuity, and we become a little bit disoriented.
p147
aVSo I can show you an object you've never seen before.
p148
aVOh, that's a cell phone.
p149
aVBut you've never seen this one before.
p150
aVWhat you're doing
p151
aVis sizing up the pattern of structural features,
p152
aVand then you go through your databanks:
p153
aVCell phone. Oh! That's a cell phone.
p154
aVIf I took a bite out of it, you'd go,
p155
aV"Wait a second.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
V"That's not a cell phone.
p160
aVThat's one of those new chocolate cell phones."
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
VYou'd have to start a new category,
p165
aVright between cell phones and chocolate.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VThat's how we process information.
p170
aa(lp171
VYou translate that to the building industry.
p172
aVIf we have a wall of windowpanes and one pane is cracked, we go,
p173
aV"Oh, dear. That's cracked. Let's repair it.
p174
aVLet's take it out and throw it away so nobody can use it
p175
aVand put a new one in."
p176
aVBecause that's what you do with a cracked pane.
p177
aVNever mind that it doesn't affect our lives at all.
p178
aVIt only rattles that expected pattern and unity of structural features.
p179
aVHowever, if we took a small hammer,
p180
aVand we added cracks to all the other windows \u2014
p181
aa(lp182
V(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
Vthen we have a pattern.
p185
aVBecause Gestalt psychology emphasizes recognition of pattern
p186
aVover parts that comprise a pattern.
p187
aVWe'll go, "Ooh, that's nice."
p188
aVSo, that serves me every day.
p189
aVRepetition creates pattern.
p190
aVIf I have 100 of these, 100 of those,
p191
aVit makes no difference what these and those are.
p192
aVIf I can repeat anything, I have the possibility of a pattern,
p193
aVfrom hickory nuts and chicken eggs, shards of glass, branches.
p194
aVIt doesn't make any difference.
p195
aVThat causes a lot of waste in the building industry.
p196
aa(lp197
VThe second cause is,
p198
aVFriedrich Nietzsche, along about 1885,
p199
aVwrote a book titled "The Birth of Tragedy."
p200
aVAnd in there,
p201
aVhe said cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives:
p202
aVon the one hand, we have an Apollonian perspective,
p203
aVwhich is very crisp and premeditated and intellectualized
p204
aVand perfect.
p205
aVOn the other end of the spectrum, we have a Dionysian perspective,
p206
aVwhich is more given to the passions and intuition,
p207
aVtolerant of organic texture and human gesture.
p208
aVSo the way the Apollonian personality takes a picture or hangs a picture is,
p209
aVthey'll get out a transit
p210
aVand a laser level
p211
aVand a micrometer.
p212
aV"OK, honey. A thousandth of an inch to the left.
p213
aVThat's where we want the picture. Right. Perfect!"
p214
aVPredicated on plumb level, square and centered.
p215
aVThe Dionysian personality takes the picture and goes:
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VThat's the difference.
p220
aVI feature blemish.
p221
aVI feature organic process.
p222
aVDead center John Dewey.
p223
aVApollonian mindset creates mountains of waste.
p224
aVIf something isn't perfect,
p225
aVif it doesn't line up with that premeditated model?
p226
aVDumpster.
p227
aV"Oops. Scratch. Dumpster."
p228
aV"Oops" this, "oops" that. Landfill, landfill, landfill.
p229
aa(lp230
VThe third thing is arguably \u2014
p231
aVThe Industrial Revolution started in the Renaissance
p232
aVwith the rise of humanism,
p233
aVthen got a little jump start along about the French Revolution.
p234
aVBy the middle of the 19th century, it's in full flower.
p235
aVAnd we have dumaflaches and gizmos
p236
aVand contraptions that will do anything
p237
aVthat we, up to that point,
p238
aVhad to do by hand.
p239
aVSo now we have standardized materials.
p240
aVWell, trees don't grow two inches by four inches,
p241
aVeight, ten and twelve feet tall.
p242
aa(lp243
V(Laughter)
p244
aa(lp245
VWe create mountains of waste.
p246
aVAnd they're doing a pretty good job there in the forest,
p247
aVworking all the byproduct of their industry \u2014
p248
aVwith OSB and particle board and so forth and so on \u2014
p249
aVbut it does no good
p250
aVto be responsible at the point of harvest in the forest
p251
aVif consumers are wasting the harvest at the point of consumption.
p252
aVAnd that's what's happening.
p253
aVAnd so if something isn't standard,
p254
aV"Oops, dumpster." "Oops" this. "Oops, warped."
p255
aVIf you buy a two-by-four and it's not straight,
p256
aVyou can take it back.
p257
aV"Oh, I'm so sorry, sir. We'll get you a straight one."
p258
aVWell, I feature all those warped things
p259
aVbecause repetition creates pattern,
p260
aVand it's from a Dionysian perspective.
p261
aa(lp262
VThe fourth thing
p263
aVis labor is disproportionately more expensive than materials.
p264
aVWell, that's just a myth.
p265
aVAnd there's a story:
p266
aVJim Tulles, one of the guys I trained \u2014 I said, "Jim, it's time now.
p267
aVI got a job for you as a foreman on a framing crew. Time for you to go."
p268
aV"Dan, I just don't think I'm ready."
p269
aV"Jim, now it's time. You're the down \u2014 oh!"
p270
aVSo we hired on.
p271
aVAnd he was out there with a tape measure, going through the trash heap,
p272
aVlooking for header material, or the board that goes over a door,
p273
aVthinking he'd impress his boss \u2014 that's how we taught him to do it.
p274
aVThe superintendent walked up and said, "What are you doing?"
p275
aV"Oh, just looking for header material,"
p276
aVwaiting for that kudos.
p277
aVHe said, "I'm not paying you to go through the trash. Get back to work."
p278
aVAnd Jim had the wherewithal to say,
p279
aV"You know, if you were paying me 300 dollars an hour,
p280
aVI can see how you might say that.
p281
aVBut right now, I'm saving you five dollars a minute.
p282
aVDo the math."
p283
aa(lp284
V(Laughter)
p285
aa(lp286
V"Good call, Tulles. From now on, you guys hit this pile first."
p287
aVAnd the irony is that he wasn't very good at math.
p288
aa(lp289
V(Laughter)
p290
aa(lp291
VBut once in a while, you get access to the control room,
p292
aVand then you can kind of mess with the dials.
p293
aVAnd that's what happened there.
p294
aa(lp295
VThe fifth thing is that maybe, after 2,500 years,
p296
aVPlato is still having his way with us in his notion of perfect forms.
p297
aVHe said that we have in our noggin the perfect idea of what we want,
p298
aVand we force environmental resources to accommodate that.
p299
aVSo we all have in our head the perfect house,
p300
aVthe American dream, which is a house,
p301
aVthe dream house.
p302
aVThe problem is we can't afford it.
p303
aVSo we have the American dream look-alike,
p304
aVwhich is a mobile home.
p305
aVNow there's a blight on the planet.
p306
aa(lp307
V(Laughter)
p308
aa(lp309
VIt's a chattel mortgage,
p310
aVjust like furniture, just like a car.
p311
aVYou write the check, and instantly, it depreciates 30 percent.
p312
aVAfter a year, you can't get insurance on everything you have in it,
p313
aVonly on 70 percent.
p314
aVWired with 14-Gauge wire, typically.
p315
aVNothing wrong with that,
p316
aVunless you ask it to do what 12-Gauge wire's supposed to do,
p317
aVand that's what happens.
p318
aVIt out-gasses formaldehyde \u2014
p319
aVso much so that there is a federal law in place
p320
aVto warn new mobile home buyers of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger.
p321
aVAre we just being numbingly stupid?
p322
aVThe walls are this thick.
p323
aVThe whole thing has the structural value of corn.
p324
aa(lp325
V(Laughter)
p326
aa(lp327
V"So ... I thought Palm Harbor Village was over there."
p328
aV"No, no. We had a wind last night.
p329
aVIt's gone now."
p330
aa(lp331
V(Laughter)
p332
aa(lp333
VThen when they degrade, what do you do with them?
p334
aa(lp335
VNow, all that \u2014
p336
aVthat Apollonian, Platonic model \u2014
p337
aVis what the building industry is predicated on,
p338
aVand there are a number of things that exacerbate that.
p339
aVOne is that all the professionals,
p340
aVall the tradesmen, vendors,
p341
aVinspectors, engineers, architects
p342
aVall think like this.
p343
aVAnd then it works its way back to the consumer,
p344
aVwho demands the same model.
p345
aVIt's a self-fulfilling prophecy. We can't get out of it.
p346
aVThen here come the marketeers and the advertisers.
p347
aV"Woo. Woo-hoo."
p348
aVWe buy stuff we didn't know we needed.
p349
aVAll we have to do is look at what one company did
p350
aVwith carbonated prune juice.
p351
aVHow disgusting.
p352
aa(lp353
V(Laughter)
p354
aa(lp355
VBut you know what they did?
p356
aVThey hooked a metaphor into it and said, "I drink Dr. Pepper ..."
p357
aVAnd pretty soon, we're swilling that stuff by the lake-ful,
p358
aVby the billions of gallons.
p359
aVIt doesn't even have real prunes! Doesn't even keep you regular.
p360
aa(lp361
V(Laughter)
p362
aa(lp363
VMy oh my, that makes it worse.
p364
aVAnd we get sucked into that faster than anything.
p365
aa(lp366
VThen, a man named Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a book
p367
aVtitled "Being and Nothingness."
p368
aVIt's a pretty quick read. You can snap through it in maybe \u2014
p369
aa(lp370
V(Laughter)
p371
aa(lp372
Vmaybe two years,
p373
aVif you read eight hours a day.
p374
aVIn there, he talked about the divided self.
p375
aVHe said human beings act differently when they know they're alone
p376
aVthan when they know somebody else is around.
p377
aVSo if I'm eating spaghetti, and I know I'm alone,
p378
aVI can eat like a backhoe.
p379
aVI can wipe my mouth on my sleeve, napkin on the table,
p380
aVchew with my mouth open, make little noises,
p381
aVscratch wherever I want.
p382
aa(lp383
V(Laughter)
p384
aa(lp385
VBut as soon as you walk in,
p386
aVI go, "Oops! Lil' spaghetti sauce there."
p387
aVNapkin in my lap, half-bites,
p388
aVchew with my mouth closed, no scratching.
p389
aVNow, what I'm doing is fulfilling your expectations
p390
aVof how I should live my life.
p391
aVI feel that expectation,
p392
aVand so I accommodate it,
p393
aVand I'm living my life according to what you expect me to do.
p394
aVThat happens in the building industry as well.
p395
aVThat's why all subdivisions look the same.
p396
aVSometimes, we even have these formalized cultural expectations.
p397
aVI'll bet all your shoes match.
p398
aVSure enough, we all buy into that ...
p399
aa(lp400
V(Laughter)
p401
aa(lp402
VAnd with gated communities,
p403
aVwe have a formalized expectation,
p404
aVwith a homeowners' association.
p405
aVSometimes those guys are Nazis,
p406
aVmy oh my.
p407
aVThat exacerbates and continues this model.
p408
aa(lp409
VThe last thing is gregariousness.
p410
aVHuman beings are a social species.
p411
aVWe like to hang together in groups,
p412
aVjust like wildebeests, just like lions.
p413
aVWildebeests don't hang with lions,
p414
aVbecause lions eat wildebeests.
p415
aVHuman beings are like that.
p416
aVWe do what that group does
p417
aVthat we're trying to identify with.
p418
aVYou see this in junior high a lot.
p419
aVThose kids, they'll work all summer long \u2014 kill themselves \u2014
p420
aVso that they can afford one pair of designer jeans.
p421
aVSo along about September,
p422
aVthey can stride in and go,
p423
aV"I'm important today. See? Don't touch my designer jeans!
p424
aVI see you don't have designer jeans.
p425
aVYou're not one of the beautiful \u2014 See, I'm one of the beautiful people.
p426
aVSee my jeans?"
p427
aVRight there is reason enough to have uniforms.
p428
aVAnd so that happens in the building industry as well.
p429
aa(lp430
VWe have confused Maslow's hierarchy of needs,
p431
aVjust a little bit.
p432
aVOn the bottom tier, we have basic needs:
p433
aVshelter, clothing, food, water, mating and so forth.
p434
aVSecond: security. Third: relationships.
p435
aVFourth: status, self-esteem \u2014 that is, vanity \u2014
p436
aVand we're taking vanity and shoving it down here.
p437
aVAnd so we end up
p438
aVwith vain decisions,
p439
aVand we can't even afford our mortgage.
p440
aVWe can't afford to eat anything except beans;
p441
aa(lp442
Vthat is, our housing has become a commodity.
p443
aVAnd it takes a little bit of nerve
p444
aVto dive into those primal,
p445
aVterrifying parts of ourselves
p446
aVand make our own decisions
p447
aVand not make our housing a commodity,
p448
aVbut make it something that bubbles up from seminal sources.
p449
aVThat takes a little bit of nerve,
p450
aVand, darn it, once in a while, you fail.
p451
aVBut that's okay.
p452
aVIf failure destroys you,
p453
aVthen you can't do this.
p454
aVI fail all the time, every day,
p455
aVand I've had some whopping failures, I promise \u2014
p456
aVbig, public, humiliating, embarrassing failures.
p457
aa(lp458
VEverybody points and laughs,
p459
aVand they say, "He tried it a fifth time, and it still didn't work!
p460
aVWhat a moron!"
p461
aVEarly on, contractors come by and say,
p462
aV"Dan, you're a cute little bunny,
p463
aVbut you know, this just isn't going to work.
p464
aVWhat don't you do this? Why don't you do that?"
p465
