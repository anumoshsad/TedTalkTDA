VImagine that you invented a device
p4
aVthat can record my memories,
p5
aVmy dreams, my ideas,
p6
aVand transmit them to your brain.
p7
aVThat would be a game-changing technology, right?
p8
aVBut in fact, we already possess this device,
p9
aVand it's called human communication system
p10
aVand effective storytelling.
p11
aVTo understand how this device works,
p12
aVwe have to look into our brains.
p13
aVAnd we have to formulate the question in a slightly different manner.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow we have to ask
p16
aVhow these neuron patterns in my brain
p17
aVthat are associated with my memories and ideas
p18
aVare transmitted into your brains.
p19
aVAnd we think there are two factors that enable us to communicate.
p20
aVFirst, your brain is now physically coupled to the sound wave
p21
aVthat I'm transmitting to your brain.
p22
aVAnd second, we developed a common neural protocol
p23
aVthat enabled us to communicate.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo how do we know that?
p26
aVIn my lab in Princeton,
p27
aVwe bring people to the fMRI scanner and we scan their brains
p28
aVwhile they are either telling or listening to real-life stories.
p29
aVAnd to give you a sense of the stimulus we are using,
p30
aVlet me play 20 seconds from a story that we used,
p31
aVtold by a very talented storyteller,
p32
aVJim O'Grady.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Audio) Jim O'Grady: So I'm banging out my story and I know it's good,
p35
aVand then I start to make it better \u2014
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
Vby adding an element of embellishment.
p40
aVReporters call this "making shit up."
p41
aa(lp42
V(Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd they recommend against crossing that line.
p45
aVBut I had just seen the line crossed between a high-powered dean
p46
aVand assault with a pastry.
p47
aVAnd I kinda liked it."
p48
aa(lp49
VUri Hasson: OK, so now let's look into your brain
p50
aVand see what's happening when you listen to these kinds of stories.
p51
aVAnd let's start simple \u2014 let's start with one listener and one brain area:
p52
aVthe auditory cortex that processes the sounds that come from the ear.
p53
aVAnd as you can see, in this particular brain area,
p54
aVthe responses are going up and down as the story is unfolding.
p55
aVNow we can take these responses
p56
aVand compare them to the responses in other listeners
p57
aVin the same brain area.
p58
aVAnd we can ask:
p59
aVHow similar are the responses across all listeners?
p60
aa(lp61
VSo here you can see five listeners.
p62
aVAnd we start to scan their brains before the story starts,
p63
aVwhen they're simply lying in the dark and waiting for the story to begin.
p64
aVAs you can see,
p65
aVthe brain area is going up and down in each one of them,
p66
aVbut the responses are very different,
p67
aVand not in sync.
p68
aVHowever, immediately as the story is starting,
p69
aVsomething amazing is happening.
p70
aa(lp71
V(Audio) JO: So I'm banging out my story and I know it's good,
p72
aVand then I start to make it \u2014
p73
aa(lp74
VUH: Suddenly, you can see that the responses in all of the subjects
p75
aVlock to the story,
p76
aVand now they are going up and down in a very similar way
p77
aVacross all listeners.
p78
aVAnd in fact, this is exactly what is happening now in your brains
p79
aVwhen you listen to my sound speaking.
p80
aVWe call this effect "neural entrainment."
p81
aVAnd to explain to you what is neural entrainment,
p82
aVlet me first explain what is physical entrainment.
p83
aa(lp84
VSo, we'll look and see five metronomes.
p85
aVThink of these five metronomes as five brains.
p86
aVAnd similar to the listeners before the story starts,
p87
aVthese metronomes are going to click,
p88
aVbut they're going to click out of phase.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Clicking)
p91
aa(lp92
VNow see what will happen when I connect them together
p93
aVby placing them on these two cylinders.
p94
aa(lp95
V(Clicking)
p96
aa(lp97
VNow these two cylinders start to rotate.
p98
aVThis rotation vibration is going through the wood
p99
aVand is going to couple all the metronomes together.
p100
aVAnd now listen to the click.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Synchronized clicking)
p103
aa(lp104
VThis is what you call physical entrainment.
p105
aVNow let's go back to the brain and ask:
p106
aVWhat's driving this neural entrainment?
p107
aVIs it simply the sounds that the speaker is producing?
p108
aVOr maybe it's the words.
p109
aVOr maybe it's the meaning that the speaker is trying to convey.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo to test it, we did the following experiment.
p112
aVFirst, we took the story and played it backwards.
p113
aVAnd that preserved many of the original auditory features,
p114
aVbut removed the meaning.
p115
aVAnd it sounds something like that.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Audio) JO: (Unintelligible)
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd we flashed colors in the two brains
p120
aVto indicate brain areas that respond very similarly across people.
p121
aVAnd as you can see,
p122
aVthis incoming sound induced entrainment or alignment in all of the brains
p123
aVin auditory cortices that process the sounds,
p124
aVbut it didn't spread deeper into the brain.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow we can take these sounds and build words out of it.
p127
aVSo if we take Jim O'Grady and scramble the words,
p128
aVwe'll get a list of words.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Audio) JO: ... an animal ... assorted facts ...
p131
aVand right on ... pie man ... potentially ... my stories
p132
aa(lp133
VUH: And you can see that these words start to induce alignment
p134
aVin early language areas, but not more than that.
p135
aVNow we can take the words and start to build sentences out of them.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Audio) JO: And they recommend against crossing that line.
p138
aVHe says: "Dear Jim, Good story. Nice details.
p139
aVDidn't she only know about him through me?"
p140
aa(lp141
VUH: Now you can see that the responses in all the language areas
p142
aVthat process the incoming language
p143
aVbecome aligned or similar across all listeners.
p144
aVHowever, only when we use the full, engaging, coherent story
p145
aVdo the responses spread deeper into the brain
p146
aVinto higher-order areas,
p147
aVwhich include the frontal cortex and the parietal cortex,
p148
aVand make all of them respond very similarly.
p149
aVAnd we believe that these responses in higher-order areas are induced
p150
aVor become similar across listeners
p151
aVbecause of the meaning conveyed by the speaker,
p152
aVand not by words or sound.
p153
aVAnd if we are right, there's a strong prediction over here
p154
aVif I tell you the exact same ideas
p155
aVusing two very different sets of words,
p156
aVyour brain responses will still be similar.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd to test it, we did the following experiment in my lab.
p159
aVWe took the English story
p160
aVand translated it to Russian.
p161
aVNow you have two different sounds and linguistic systems
p162
aVthat convey the exact same meaning.
p163
aVAnd you play the English story to the English listeners
p164
aVand the Russian story to the Russian listeners,
p165
aVand we can compare their responses across the groups.
p166
aVAnd when we did that, we didn't see responses that are similar
p167
aVin auditory cortices in language,
p168
aVbecause the language and sound are very different.
p169
aVHowever, you can see that the responses in high-order areas
p170
aVwere still similar across these two groups.
p171
aVWe believe this is because they understood the story in a very similar way,
p172
aVas we confirmed, using a test after the story ended.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd we think that this alignment is necessary for communication.
p175
aVFor example, as you can tell,
p176
aVI am not a native English speaker.
p177
aVI grew up with another language,
p178
aVand the same might be for many of you in the audience.
p179
aVAnd still, we can communicate.
p180
aVHow come?
p181
aVWe think we can communicate because we have this common code
p182
aVthat presents meaning.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo far, I've only talked about what's happening in the listener's brain,
p185
aVin your brain, when you're listening to talks.
p186
aVBut what's happening in the speaker's brain, in my brain,
p187
aVwhen I'm speaking to you?
p188
aVTo look in the speaker's brain,
p189
aVwe asked the speaker to go into the scanner,
p190
aVwe scan his brain
p191
aVand then compare his brain responses to the brain responses of the listeners
p192
aVlistening to the story.
p193
aVYou have to remember that producing speech and comprehending speech
p194
aVare very different processes.
p195
aVHere we're asking: How similar are they?
p196
aVTo our surprise,
p197
aVwe saw that all these complex patterns within the listeners
p198
aVactually came from the speaker brain.
p199
aVSo production and comprehension rely on very similar processes.
p200
aVAnd we also found
p201
aVthe stronger the similarity between the listener's brain
p202
aVand the speaker's brain,
p203
aVthe better the communication.
p204
aVSo I know that if you are completely confused now,
p205
aVand I do hope that this is not the case,
p206
aVyour brain responses are very different than mine.
p207
aVBut I also know that if you really understand me now,
p208
aVthen your brain ... and your brain ... and your brain
p209
aVare really similar to mine.
p210
aa(lp211
VNow, let's take all this information together and ask:
p212
aVHow can we use it to transmit a memory that I have
p213
aVfrom my brain to your brains?
p214
aVSo we did the following experiment.
p215
aVWe let people watch, for the first time in their life,
p216
aVa TV episode from the BBC series "Sherlock," while we scanned their brains.
p217
aVAnd then we asked them to go back to the scanner
p218
aVand tell the story to another person that never watched the movie.
p219
aVSo let's be specific.
p220
aVThink about this exact scene,
p221
aVwhen Sherlock is entering the cab in London
p222
aVdriven by the murderer he is looking for.
p223
aa(lp224
VWith me, as a viewer,
p225
aVthere is a specific brain pattern in my brain when I watch it.
p226
aVNow, the exact same pattern, I can reactivate in my brain again
p227
aVby telling the word: Sherlock, London, murderer.
p228
aVAnd when I'm transmitting these words to your brains now,
p229
aVyou have to reconstruct it in your mind.
p230
aVIn fact, we see that pattern emerging now in your brains.
p231
aVAnd we were really surprised to see
p232
aVthat the pattern you have now in your brains
p233
aVwhen I'm describing to you these scenes
p234
aVwould be very similar to the pattern I had when I watched this movie
p235
aVa few months ago in the scanner.
p236
aVThis starts to tell you about the mechanism
p237
aVby which we can tell stories and transmit information.
p238
aVBecause, for example,
p239
aVnow you're listening really hard and trying to understand what I'm saying.
p240
aVAnd I know that it's not easy.
p241
aVBut I hope that at one point in the talk we clicked, and you got me.
p242
aVAnd I think that in a few hours, a few days, a few months,
p243
aVyou're going to meet someone at a party,
p244
aVand you're going to tell him about this lecture,
p245
aVand suddenly it will be as if he is standing now here with us.
p246
aVNow you can see how we can take this mechanism
p247
aVand try to transmit memories and knowledge across people,
p248
aVwhich is wonderful, right?
p249
aa(lp250
VBut our ability to communicate relies on our ability
p251
aVto have common ground.
p252
aVBecause, for example,
p253
aVif I'm going to use the British synonym
p254
aV"hackney carriage" instead of "cab,"
p255
aVI know that I'm going to be misaligned with most of you in the audience.
p256
aVThis alignment depends not only on our ability
p257
aVto understand the basic concept;
p258
aVit also depends on our ability to develop common ground and understanding
p259
aVand shared belief systems.
p260
aVBecause we know that in many cases,
p261
aVpeople understand the exact same story in very different ways.
p262
aa(lp263
VSo to test it in the lab, we did the following experiment.
p264
aVWe took a story by J.D. Salinger,
p265
aVin which a husband lost track of his wife in the middle of a party,
p266
aVand he's calling his best friend, asking, "Did you see my wife?"
p267
aVFor half of the subjects,
p268
aVwe said that the wife was having an affair with the best friend.
p269
aVFor the other half,
p270
aVwe said that the wife is loyal and the husband is very jealous.
p271
aVThis one sentence before the story started
p272
aVwas enough to make the brain responses
p273
aVof all the people that believed the wife was having an affair
p274
aVbe very similar in these high-order areas
p275
aVand different than the other group.
p276
aVAnd if one sentence is enough to make your brain similar
p277
aVto people that think like you
p278
aVand very different than people that think differently than you,
p279
aVthink how this effect is going to be amplified in real life,
p280
aVwhen we are all listening to the exact same news item
p281
aVafter being exposed day after day after day
p282
aVto different media channels, like Fox News or The New York Times,
p283
aVthat give us very different perspectives on reality.
p284
aa(lp285
VSo let me summarize.
p286
aVIf everything worked as planned tonight,
p287
aVI used my ability to vocalize sound to be coupled to your brains.
p288
aVAnd I used this coupling
p289
aVto transmit my brain patterns associated with my memories and ideas
p290
aVinto your brains.
p291
aVIn this, I start to reveal the hidden neural mechanism
p292
aVby which we communicate.
p293
aVAnd we know that in the future it will enable us to improve
p294
aVand facilitate communication.
p295
aVBut these studies also reveal
p296
aVthat communication relies on a common ground.
p297
aVAnd we have to be really worried as a society
p298
aVif we lose this common ground and our ability to speak with people
p299
aVthat are slightly different than us
p300
aVbecause we let a few very strong media channels
p301
aVtake control of the mic,
p302
aVand manipulate and control the way we all think.
p303
aVAnd I'm not sure how to fix it because I'm only a scientist.
p304
aVBut maybe one way to do it
p305
aVis to go back to the more natural way of communication,
p306
aVwhich is a dialogue,
p307
aVin which it's not only me speaking to you now,
p308
aVbut a more natural way of talking,
p309
aVin which I am speaking and I am listening,
p310
aVand together we are trying to come to a common ground and new ideas.
p311
aVBecause after all,
p312
aVthe people we are coupled to define who we are.
p313
aVAnd our desire to be coupled to another brain
p314
aVis something very basic that starts at a very early age.
p315
aa(lp316
VSo let me finish with an example from my own private life
p317
aVthat I think is a good example of how coupling to other people
p318
aVis really going to define who we are.
p319
aa(lp320
VThis my son Jonathan at a very early age.
p321
aVSee how he developed a vocal game together with my wife,
p322
aVonly from the desire and pure joy of being coupled to another human being.
p323
aa(lp324
V(Both vocalizing)
p325
aa(lp326
V(Laughter)
p327
aa(lp328
VNow, think how the ability of my son
p329
aVto be coupled to us and other people in his life
p330
aVis going to shape the man he is going to become.
p331
aVAnd think how you change on a daily basis
p332
aVfrom the interaction and coupling to other people in your life.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo keep being coupled to other people.
p335
aVKeep spreading your ideas,
p336
aVbecause the sum of all of us together, coupled,
p337
aVis greater than our parts.
p338
