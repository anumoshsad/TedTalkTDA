VHave you ever wondered
p4
aVwhat is inside your dental plaque?
p5
aVProbably not, but people like me do.
p6
aVI'm an archeological geneticist
p7
aVat the Center for Evolutionary Medicine
p8
aVat the University of Zurich,
p9
aVand I study the origins and evolution of human health and disease
p10
aVby conducting genetic research
p11
aVon the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient humans.
p12
aVAnd through this work, I hope to better understand
p13
aVthe evolutionary vulnerabilities of our bodies,
p14
aVso that we can improve
p15
aVand better manage our health in the future.
p16
aa(lp17
VThere are different ways to approach evolutionary medicine,
p18
aVand one way is to extract human DNA
p19
aVfrom ancient bones.
p20
aVAnd from these extracts,
p21
aVwe can reconstruct the human genome at different points in time
p22
aVand look for changes that might be related to adaptations,
p23
aVrisk factors and inherited diseases.
p24
aVBut this is only one half of the story.
p25
aa(lp26
VThe most important health challenges today
p27
aVare not caused by simple mutations in our genome,
p28
aVbut rather result from a complex and dynamic interplay
p29
aVbetween genetic variation,
p30
aVdiet, microbes and parasites
p31
aVand our immune response.
p32
aVAll of these diseases
p33
aVhave a strong evolutionary component
p34
aVthat directly relates to the fact
p35
aVthat we live today in a very different environment
p36
aVthan the ones in which our bodies evolved.
p37
aVAnd in order to understand these diseases,
p38
aVwe need to move past studies of the human genome alone
p39
aVand towards a more holistic approach
p40
aVto human health in the past.
p41
aa(lp42
VBut there are a lot of challenges for this.
p43
aVAnd first of all, what do we even study?
p44
aVSkeletons are ubiquitous; they're found all over the place.
p45
aVBut of course, all of the soft tissue has decomposed,
p46
aVand the skeleton itself
p47
aVhas limited health information.
p48
aVMummies are a great source of information,
p49
aVexcept that they're really geographically limited
p50
aVand limited in time as well.
p51
aVCoprolites are fossilized human feces,
p52
aVand they're actually extremely interesting.
p53
aVYou can learn a lot about ancient diet and intestinal disease,
p54
aVbut they are very rare.
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VSo to address this problem,
p59
aVI put together a team of international researchers
p60
aVin Switzerland, Denmark and the U.K.
p61
aVto study a very poorly studied, little known material
p62
aVthat's found on people everywhere.
p63
aVIt's a type of fossilized dental plaque
p64
aVthat is called officially dental calculus.
p65
aVMany of you may know it by the term tartar.
p66
aVIt's what the dentist cleans off your teeth
p67
aVevery time that you go in for a visit.
p68
aVAnd in a typical dentistry visit,
p69
aVyou may have about 15 to 30 milligrams removed.
p70
aVBut in ancient times before tooth brushing,
p71
aVup to 600 milligrams might have built up on the teeth
p72
aVover a lifetime.
p73
aa(lp74
VAnd what's really important about dental calculus
p75
aVis that it fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton,
p76
aVit's abundant in quantity before the present day
p77
aVand it's ubiquitous worldwide.
p78
aVWe find it in every population around the world at all time periods
p79
aVgoing back tens of thousands of years.
p80
aVAnd we even find it in neanderthals and animals.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd so previous studies
p83
aVhad only focused on microscopy.
p84
aVThey'd looked at dental calculus under a microscope,
p85
aVand what they had found was things like pollen
p86
aVand plant starches,
p87
aVand they'd found muscle cells from animal meats
p88
aVand bacteria.
p89
aVAnd so what my team of researchers, what we wanted to do,
p90
aVis say, can we apply
p91
aVgenetic and proteomic technology
p92
aVto go after DNA and proteins,
p93
aVand from this can we get better taxonomic resolution
p94
aVto really understand what's going on?
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd what we found
p97
aVis that we can find many commensal and pathogenic bacteria
p98
aVthat inhabited the nasal passages and mouth.
p99
aVWe also have found immune proteins
p100
aVrelated to infection and inflammation
p101
aVand proteins and DNA related to diet.
p102
aVBut what was surprising to us, and also quite exciting,
p103
aVis we also found bacteria
p104
aVthat normally inhabit upper respiratory systems.
p105
aVSo it gives us virtual access to the lungs,
p106
aVwhich is where many important diseases reside.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd we also found bacteria
p109
aVthat normally inhabit the gut.
p110
aVAnd so we can also now virtually gain access
p111
aVto this even more distant organ system
p112
aVthat, from the skeleton alone,
p113
aVhas long decomposed.
p114
aVAnd so by applying ancient DNA sequencing
p115
aVand protein mass spectrometry technologies
p116
aVto ancient dental calculus,
p117
aVwe can generate immense quantities of data
p118
aVthat then we can use to begin to reconstruct a detailed picture
p119
aVof the dynamic interplay
p120
aVbetween diet, infection and immunity
p121
aVthousands of years ago.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo what started out as an idea,
p124
aVis now being implemented
p125
aVto churn out millions of sequences
p126
aVthat we can use to investigate
p127
aVthe long-term evolutionary history of human health and disease,
p128
aVright down to the genetic code of individual pathogens.
p129
aVAnd from this information
p130
aVwe can learn about how pathogens evolve
p131
aVand also why they continue to make us sick.
p132
aVAnd I hope I have convinced you
p133
aVof the value of dental calculus.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd as a final parting thought,
p136
aVon behalf of future archeologists,
p137
aVI would like to ask you to please think twice
p138
aVbefore you go home and brush your teeth.
p139
