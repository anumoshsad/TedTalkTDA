VI'd like to start my performance by saying 90 percent of everything is crap.
p4
aV(Laughter)
p5
aVIt's called Sturgeon's law, and what that means
p6
aVis that the majority of anything is always bad.
p7
aa(lp8
VI have a giraffe here.
p9
aVI'm going to throw the giraffe behind my back
p10
aVand whoever catches it is going to help me on this next thing.
p11
aVSir, you caught the giraffe.
p12
aVI have a playing card in my hand.
p13
aVFreely name any card in the deck.
p14
aVAudience member: 10 of hearts.
p15
aVHelder Guimarães: 10 of hearts.
p16
aVYou could have named any card in the deck,
p17
aVbut you said the 10 of hearts.
p18
aVNinety percent of everything is crap,
p19
aVso there's this to prove that Sturgeon was correct.
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aV(Applause)
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVSir, this is not your show.
p24
aV(Laughter)
p25
aVKeep the giraffe for a moment, okay?
p26
aVJesus.
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aVCrazy people.
p29
aa(lp30
VWell, the truth is,
p31
aVwhy is the majority of everything bad?
p32
aVAnd my answer is: I think we stop thinking too soon.
p33
aVI'll give you a clear little example,
p34
aVsomething that people used to do around the turn of the century \u2014
p35
aVnot this century, the other one.
p36
aVThe idea was to take a piece of paper
p37
aVand fold it inside out using only your weaker hand,
p38
aVin my case, the left hand.
p39
aVSomething that would look like this.
p40
aVBy the way you reacted, I can see your lack of interest.
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aVBut that's okay, I understand why.
p43
aVWe stop thinking too soon.
p44
aa(lp45
VBut if we give it a little bit more thought,
p46
aVlike a paper clip.
p47
aVA paper clip makes this a little bit more interesting.
p48
aVNot only that, if instead of using my hand with the fingers,
p49
aVI use my hand closed into a fist,
p50
aVthat makes this even a little bit more interesting.
p51
aVNot only that, but I will impose myself a time limit of one second,
p52
aVsomething that would look like this.
p53
aVNow \u2014 no, no, no.
p54
aVSturgeon may be correct.
p55
aVBut he doesn't have to be correct forever.
p56
aVThings can always change.
p57
aVSir, what was the card?
p58
aVThe 10 of hearts?
p59
aVThere's this to prove that things can always change \u2014
p60
aVthe 10 of hearts.
p61
aV(Applause)
p62
aa(lp63
VSecrets are important.
p64
aVAnd secrets are valuable.
p65
aVAnd this is the best secret I've ever experienced.
p66
aVIt starts with a deck of cards onto the table,
p67
aVan old man and a claim,
p68
aV"I will not touch the deck till the end."
p69
aVIt doesn't matter who the man was,
p70
aVall that matters was that sentence ringing in my head:
p71
aV"I will not touch the deck till the end."
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, during all this time,
p74
aVhe was holding a small notebook
p75
aVthat sometimes he would open and flip through the pages
p76
aVand look at something.
p77
aVBut I was not really paying attention to the book
p78
aVbecause I was paying attention the deck and the claim he had made before,
p79
aV"I will not touch the deck till the end."
p80
aa(lp81
VNow sir, you have the giraffe.
p82
aVGo ahead, throw it in any direction
p83
aVso that you can find someone else at random.
p84
aVPerfect. Sir, you're going to play my role in this story.
p85
aVThe old man turned to me and he said,
p86
aV"You could pick a red card or a black card."
p87
aVMy answer was ...
p88
aVAudience member 2: The black card.
p89
aVHG: Indeed!
p90
aVIt was a black card.
p91
aVHe said, "It could be a club or a spade,"
p92
aVand my answer was ...
p93
aVAudience member 2: Spade.
p94
aVHG: Indeed! It was a spade.
p95
aVHe said, "It could be a high spade or a low spade."
p96
aVAnd my answer was ...
p97
aVAudience member 2: A high spade.
p98
aVHG: Indeed! It was a high spade.
p99
aVSince it's a high spade, it could be a nine, a 10,
p100
aVa jack, king, queen or the ace of spades.
p101
aVAnd my answer was ...
p102
aVAudience member 2: The king.
p103
aVHG: The king of spades, indeed.
p104
aVNow sir, let's be fair.
p105
aVYou selected black, you selected spade,
p106
aVyou selected the high spade, and you selected \u2014 sorry?
p107
aVAudience member 2: King. HG: King of spades.
p108
aVDid you feel I influenced you in any decision?
p109
aVAudience member 2: No, I just felt your energy.
p110
aVHG: But it was a free choice, correct?
p111
aVBecause if not, we could start all over again.
p112
aVBut it was really fair? Audience member 2: Absolutely.
p113
aa(lp114
VHG: Now, the old man turned to me and he asked me one more question,
p115
aVa number between one and 52.
p116
aVAnd the first number I thought of was ...
p117
aVAudience member 2: 17.
p118
aVHG: Indeed! It was the 17.
p119
aVThe old man only said one more thing:
p120
aV"This is the end."
p121
aVAnd I knew exactly what that meant.
p122
aVI knew that he was going to touch the deck.
p123
aVEverything that you're about to see is exactly as it looked.
p124
aVHe took the deck out of the box.
p125
aVNothing in the box.
p126
aVHe counted, "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10."
p127
aVThe tension was building.
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aV"11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17."
p130
aVAnd on the 17, instead of the king of spades,
p131
aVsomething appeared in the middle of the deck,
p132
aVthat later, I would realize was actually a secret.
p133
aa(lp134
VThe old man stood up, he left.
p135
aVI never saw him again.
p136
aVBut he left his notebook
p137
aVthat was there from the beginning.
p138
aVAnd when I picked it up,
p139
aVthat was the best secret I've ever experienced.
p140
aVWe are defined by the secrets we keep
p141
aVand by the secrets we share.
p142
aVAnd this was his way of sharing a secret with me.
p143
aV(Applause)
p144
aVCrazy shit! Now \u2014
p145
aV(Laughter)
p146
aa(lp147
VI believe that amazing things happen all the time.
p148
aVI really do.
p149
aVAnd the reason why we don't see them as often,
p150
aVit's because we don't place ourselves in a position
p151
aVto search for those amazing things.
p152
aVBut what if we decided to search for those amazing things,
p153
aVfor those small coincidences in life that are truly amazing?
p154
aVSo you have the giraffe,
p155
aVgo ahead, throw it in any direction so you find one last person at random.
p156
aVSir, I'm going to ask you,
p157
aVdo you have, with you, a United States $1 bill?
p158
aVAudience member 3: I think so.
p159
aVHG: Yes? You see, a coincidence!
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aVLet's make sure you have it.
p162
aVDo you have it?
p163
aVAudience member 3: Yes. HG: Yes! Perfect.
p164
aVNow, I want you to do exactly the same thing I am about to do.
p165
aVI have a dollar bill here to explain.
p166
aVI want you to take the dollar bill,
p167
aVand fold the Washington part inside, like this.
p168
aVSo you get this kind of big square, okay?
p169
aVNow, I want you to take the bill and fold it like this, lengthwise,
p170
aVso it becomes like a rectangle,
p171
aVand then again \u2014 really fold it, really crease it \u2014
p172
aVand when you have it,
p173
aVplease fold the bill again into a little square like this
p174
aVand let me know when you have it.
p175
aVDo you have it? Perfect.
p176
aa(lp177
VNow, I'm going to approach,
p178
aVand before we start,
p179
aVI want to make sure that we do this in very, very serious conditions.
p180
aVFirst of all, I want to ensure that we have a marker and we have a paper clip.
p181
aVFirst of all, take the marker and go ahead and sign the bill.
p182
aVAnd this is the reason why:
p183
aVlater, I'm going to be doing a bunch of stuff on stage
p184
aVand I don't want you to think,
p185
aVoh, while I was distracted by Helder,
p186
aVsomeone came onstage and swapped the bill.
p187
aVSo I want to make sure it's exactly the same bill.
p188
aVNow not only that, I want you to take the paper clip
p189
aVand put it around the bill.
p190
aVSo even if nobody comes onstage and switches the bill,
p191
aVI don't have enough time to go open the bill and close it
p192
aVand see what I don't want to see.
p193
aVIs that fair?
p194
aVNow you can give me the marker back.
p195
aa(lp196
VAnd just like that, very clearly,
p197
aVI want to make sure that we place this in full view
p198
aVfrom the beginning of this experience
p199
aVand to make sure that everyone is going to see it,
p200
aVwe're going to actually have a camera man onstage.
p201
aVYes, perfect, so that you can see.
p202
aVThat's your signature? Yes? Perfect.
p203
aVNow, we're going to use also the deck and a glass for this.
p204
aVAnd we're going to put ourselves in a position
p205
aVto search for an amazing coincidence.
p206
aa(lp207
VDo you mind, can you help me with this?
p208
aVGo ahead and take some cards and shuffle.
p209
aVAnd do you mind, can you take some cards and shuffle?
p210
aVYou can take some cards and shuffle.
p211
aVYou can shuffle cards in a variety of ways.
p212
aVYou can shuffle cards like this.
p213
aVYou can shuffle cards in a more messed up way,
p214
aVsomething like this.
p215
aVYou can shuffle cards in the American way.
p216
aVAs a Portuguese, I don't feel entitled to teach you guys how to do it.
p217
aVBut the important part is after shuffling the cards,
p218
aValways remember to cut and complete the cards.
p219
aa(lp220
VDo you mind doing that for me, sir?
p221
aVPlease cut and complete.
p222
aVAnd when you have it, place the cards up in the air.
p223
aVAnd you too, cut and complete and up in the air.
p224
aVUp in the air.
p225
aVA deck of cards cut and shuffled by one, two, three, four and five people.
p226
aa(lp227
VNow, very clearly, I'm going to gather the deck together.
p228
aVAnd just like that.
p229
aVI'm going to search for a coincidence in front of everyone.
p230
aVI'm going to try.
p231
aVI have some cards that maybe,
p232
aVmaybe they don't mean anything.
p233
aVBut maybe that's because we are not paying close attention.
p234
aVBecause maybe, maybe they mean a lot.
p235
aVBefore we start, sir, you gave me a dollar bill.
p236
aVIs that your signature?
p237
aVAudience member 3: Yes it is.
p238
aVHG: I want you to see very clearly
p239
aVthat I'm going to open your bill
p240
aVand reveal a small secret that we created.
p241
aVAnd the secret of this dollar bill is the serial number.
p242
aa(lp243
VMadam, can you take the dollar bill?
p244
aVIn the serial number, there is a letter.
p245
aVWhat is the first number after the letter?
p246
aVAudience member 4: Seven.
p247
aVHG: Seven.
p248
aVSeven.
p249
aVBut, that's maybe just one coincidence.
p250
aVWhat is the second number? Audience member 4: Nine.
p251
aVSo after the seven, we have a nine.
p252
aVAnd after the nine?
p253
aVAudience member 4: Two.
p254
aVHG: The two. And after the two?
p255
aVAudience member 4: Three.
p256
aVHG: Three, and after?
p257
aVAudience member 4: Three. HG: Three.
p258
aVAudience member 4: Seven. HG: Seven.
p259
aVAudience member 4: Four. HG: Four.
p260
aVAudience member 4: Two. HG: Two, and?
p261
aVAudience member 4: Q.
p262
aVHG: Q like in queen?
p263
aa(lp264
V(Applause)
p265
aVThe queen of clubs!
p266
aVAll the cards in order, just for you.
p267
aa(lp268
VAnd that's my show.
p269
aVThank you very much and have a nice night.
