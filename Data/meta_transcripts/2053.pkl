VThis year, Germany is celebrating
p4
aVthe 25th anniversary of the peaceful revolution
p5
aVin East Germany.
p6
aVIn 1989, the Communist regime was moved away,
p7
aVthe Berlin Wall came down, and one year later,
p8
aVthe German Democratic Republic, the GDR,
p9
aVin the East was unified
p10
aVwith the Federal Republic of Germany in the West
p11
aVto found today's Germany.
p12
aVAmong many other things, Germany inherited
p13
aVthe archives of the East German secret police,
p14
aVknown as the Stasi.
p15
aVOnly two years after its dissolution,
p16
aVits documents were opened to the public,
p17
aVand historians such as me started
p18
aVto study these documents
p19
aVto learn more about how the GDR surveillance state
p20
aVfunctioned.
p21
aa(lp22
VPerhaps you have watched the movie
p23
aV"The Lives of Others."
p24
aVThis movie made the Stasi known worldwide,
p25
aVand as we live in an age where words
p26
aVsuch as "surveillance" or "wiretapping"
p27
aVare on the front pages of newspapers,
p28
aVI would like to speak about how the Stasi
p29
aVreally worked.
p30
aa(lp31
VAt the beginning, let's have a short look
p32
aVat the history of the Stasi,
p33
aVbecause it's really important for understanding
p34
aVits self-conception.
p35
aVIts origins are located in Russia.
p36
aVIn 1917, the Russian Communists founded
p37
aVthe Emergency Commission for Combating
p38
aVCounter-Revolution and Sabotage,
p39
aVshortly Cheka.
p40
aVIt was led by Felix Dzerzhinsky.
p41
aVThe Cheka was an instrument of the Communists
p42
aVto establish their regime by terrorizing the population
p43
aVand executing their enemies.
p44
aVIt evolved later into the well-known KGB.
p45
aVThe Cheka was the idol of the Stasi officers.
p46
aVThey called themselves Chekists,
p47
aVand even the emblem was very similar,
p48
aVas you can see here.
p49
aVIn fact, the secret police of Russia
p50
aVwas the creator and instructor of the Stasi.
p51
aVWhen the Red Army occupied East Germany in 1945,
p52
aVit immediately expanded there,
p53
aVand soon it started to train the German Communists
p54
aVto build up their own secret police.
p55
aVBy the way, in this hall where we are now,
p56
aVthe ruling party of the GDR was founded in 1946.
p57
aa(lp58
VFive years later, the Stasi was established,
p59
aVand step by step, the dirty job of oppression
p60
aVwas handed over to it.
p61
aVFor instance, the central jail
p62
aVfor political prisoners,
p63
aVwhich was established by the Russians,
p64
aVwas taken over by the Stasi
p65
aVand used until the end of Communism.
p66
aVYou see it here.
p67
aVAt the beginning, every important step
p68
aVtook place under the attendance of the Russians.
p69
aVBut the Germans are known to be very effective,
p70
aVso the Stasi grew very quickly,
p71
aVand already in 1953, it had more employees
p72
aVthan the Gestapo had,
p73
aVthe secret police of Nazi Germany.
p74
aVThe number doubled in each decade.
p75
aVIn 1989, more than 90,000 employees
p76
aVworked for the Stasi.
p77
aVThis meant that one employee
p78
aVwas responsible for 180 inhabitants,
p79
aVwhich was really unique in the world.
p80
aa(lp81
VAt the top of this tremendous apparatus,
p82
aVthere was one man, Erich Mielke.
p83
aVHe ruled the Ministry of State Security
p84
aVfor more than 30 years.
p85
aVHe was a scrupulous functionary \u2014
p86
aVin his past, he killed two policemen
p87
aVnot far away from here \u2014
p88
aVwho in fact personalized the Stasi.
p89
aa(lp90
VBut what was so exceptional about the Stasi?
p91
aVForemost, it was its enormous power,
p92
aVbecause it united different functions
p93
aVin one organization.
p94
aVFirst of all, the Stasi
p95
aVwas an intelligence service.
p96
aVIt used all the imaginable instruments
p97
aVfor getting information secretly,
p98
aVsuch as informers, or tapping phones,
p99
aVas you can see it on the picture here.
p100
aVAnd it was not only active in East Germany,
p101
aVbut all over the world.
p102
aVSecondly, the Stasi was a secret police.
p103
aVIt could stop people on the street
p104
aVand arrest them in its own prisons.
p105
aVThirdly, the Stasi worked
p106
aVas a kind of public prosecutor.
p107
aVIt had the right to open preliminary investigations
p108
aVand to interrogate people officially.
p109
aVLast but not least,
p110
aVthe Stasi had its own armed forces.
p111
aVMore than 11,000 soldiers were serving
p112
aVin its so-called Guards Regiment.
p113
aVIt was founded to crash down protests and uprisings.
p114
aVDue to this concentration of power,
p115
aVthe Stasi was called a state in the state.
p116
aa(lp117
VBut let's look in more and more detail
p118
aVat the tools of the Stasi.
p119
aVPlease keep in mind that at that time
p120
aVthe web and smartphones were not yet invented.
p121
aVOf course, the Stasi used all kinds
p122
aVof technical instruments to survey people.
p123
aVTelephones were wiretapped,
p124
aVincluding the phone of the German chancellor in the West,
p125
aVand often also the apartments.
p126
aVEvery day, 90,000 letters were being opened
p127
aVby these machines.
p128
aVThe Stasi also shadowed tens of thousands of people
p129
aVusing specially trained agents and secret cameras
p130
aVto document every step one took.
p131
aVIn this picture, you can see me
p132
aVas a young man just in front of this building
p133
aVwhere we are now, photographed by a Stasi agent.
p134
aVThe Stasi even collected the smell of people.
p135
aVIt stored samples of it in closed jars
p136
aVwhich were found after the peaceful revolution.
p137
aVFor all these tasks, highly specialized departments
p138
aVwere responsible.
p139
aVThe one which was tapping phone calls
p140
aVwas completely separated
p141
aVfrom the one which controlled the letters,
p142
aVfor good reasons,
p143
aVbecause if one agent quit the Stasi,
p144
aVhis knowledge was very small.
p145
aVContrast that with Snowden, for example.
p146
aVBut the vertical specialization was also important
p147
aVto prevent all kinds of empathy
p148
aVwith the object of observation.
p149
aVThe agent who shadowed me
p150
aVdidn't know who I was
p151
aVor why I was surveyed.
p152
aVIn fact, I smuggled forbidden books
p153
aVfrom West to East Germany.
p154
aa(lp155
VBut what was even more typical for the Stasi
p156
aVwas the use of human intelligence,
p157
aVpeople who reported secretly to the Stasi.
p158
aVFor the Minister of State Security,
p159
aVthese so-called unofficial employees
p160
aVwere the most important tools.
p161
aVFrom 1975 on, nearly 200,000 people
p162
aVcollaborated constantly with the Stasi,
p163
aVmore than one percent of the population.
p164
aVAnd in a way, the minister was right,
p165
aVbecause technical instruments
p166
aVcan only register what people are doing,
p167
aVbut agents and spies can also report
p168
aVwhat people are planning to do
p169
aVand what they are thinking.
p170
aVTherefore, the Stasi recruited so many informants.
p171
aVThe system of how to get them
p172
aVand how to educate them, as it was called,
p173
aVwas very sophisticated.
p174
aVThe Stasi had its own university,
p175
aVnot far away from here,
p176
aVwhere the methods were explored
p177
aVand taught to the officers.
p178
aVThis guideline gave a detailed description
p179
aVof every step you have to take
p180
aVif you want to convince human beings
p181
aVto betray their fellow citizens.
p182
aVSometimes it's said that informants were pressured
p183
aVto becoming one,
p184
aVbut that's mostly not true,
p185
aVbecause a forced informant is a bad informant.
p186
aVOnly someone who wants to give you the information you need
p187
aVis an effective whistleblower.
p188
aVThe main reasons why people cooperated with the Stasi
p189
aVwere political conviction and material benefits.
p190
aVThe officers also tried to create a personal bond
p191
aVbetween themselves and the informant,
p192
aVand to be honest, the example of the Stasi shows
p193
aVthat it's not so difficult to win someone
p194
aVin order to betray others.
p195
aVEven some of the top dissidents in East Germany
p196
aVcollaborated with the Stasi,
p197
aVas for instance Ibrahim Böhme.
p198
aVIn 1989, he was the leader of the peaceful revolution
p199
aVand he nearly became the first freely elected Prime Minister of the GDR
p200
aVuntil it came out that he was an informant.
p201
aa(lp202
VThe net of spies was really broad.
p203
aVIn nearly every institution,
p204
aVeven in the churches or in West Germany,
p205
aVthere were many of them.
p206
aVI remember telling a leading Stasi officer,
p207
aV"If you had sent an informant to me,
p208
aVI would surely have recognized him."
p209
aVHis answer was,
p210
aV"We didn't send anyone.
p211
aVWe took those who were around you."
p212
aVAnd in fact, two of my best friends
p213
aVreported about me to the Stasi.
p214
aVNot only in my case, informers were very close.
p215
aVFor example, Vera Lengsfeld, another leading dissident,
p216
aVin her case it was her husband who spied on her.
p217
aVA famous writer was betrayed by his brother.
p218
aVThis reminds me of the novel "1984" by George Orwell,
p219
aVwhere the only apparently trustable person
p220
aVwas an informer.
p221
aa(lp222
VBut why did the Stasi collect all this information
p223
aVin its archives?
p224
aVThe main purpose was to control the society.
p225
aVIn nearly every speech, the Stasi minister
p226
aVgave the order to find out who is who,
p227
aVwhich meant who thinks what.
p228
aVHe didn't want to wait until somebody
p229
aVtried to act against the regime.
p230
aVHe wanted to know in advance
p231
aVwhat people were thinking and planning.
p232
aVThe East Germans knew, of course,
p233
aVthat they were surrounded by informers,
p234
aVin a totalitarian regime that created mistrust
p235
aVand a state of widespread fear,
p236
aVthe most important tools to oppress people
p237
aVin any dictatorship.
p238
aa(lp239
VThat's why not many East Germans tried
p240
aVto fight against the Communist regime.
p241
aVIf yes, the Stasi often used a method
p242
aVwhich was really diabolic.
p243
aVIt was called Zersetzung,
p244
aVand it's described in another guideline.
p245
aVThe word is difficult to translate because it means
p246
aVoriginally "biodegradation."
p247
aVBut actually, it's a quite accurate description.
p248
aVThe goal was to destroy secretly
p249
aVthe self-confidence of people,
p250
aVfor example by damaging their reputation,
p251
aVby organizing failures in their work,
p252
aVand by destroying their personal relationships.
p253
aVConsidering this, East Germany was a very modern dictatorship.
p254
aVThe Stasi didn't try to arrest every dissident.
p255
aVIt preferred to paralyze them,
p256
aVand it could do so because
p257
aVit had access to so much personal information
p258
aVand to so many institutions.
p259
aVDetaining someone was used only
p260
aVas a last resort.
p261
aVFor this, the Stasi owned 17 remand prisons,
p262
aVone in every district.
p263
aVHere, the Stasi also developed
p264
aVquite modern methods of detention.
p265
aVNormally, the interrogation officer
p266
aVdidn't torture the prisoner.
p267
aVInstead, he used a sophisticated system
p268
aVof psychological pressure
p269
aVin which strict isolation was central.
p270
aVNearly no prisoner resisted
p271
aVwithout giving a testimony.
p272
aVIf you have the occasion,
p273
aVdo visit the former Stasi prison in Berlin
p274
aVand attend a guided tour with a former political prisoner
p275
aVwho will explain to you how this worked.
p276
aa(lp277
VOne more question needs to be answered:
p278
aVIf the Stasi were so well organized,
p279
aVwhy did the Communist regime collapse?
p280
aVFirst, in 1989, the leadership in East Germany
p281
aVwas uncertain what to do against
p282
aVthe growing protest of people.
p283
aVIt was especially confused
p284
aVbecause in the mother country of socialism,
p285
aVthe Soviet Union,
p286
aVa more liberal policy took place.
p287
aVIn addition, the regime was dependent
p288
aVon the loans from the West.
p289
aVTherefore, no order to crash down the uprising
p290
aVwas given to the Stasi.
p291
aVSecondly, in the Communist ideology,
p292
aVthere's no place for criticism.
p293
aVInstead, the leadership stuck to the belief
p294
aVthat socialism is a perfect system,
p295
aVand the Stasi had to confirm that, of course.
p296
aVThe consequence was
p297
aVthat despite all the information,
p298
aVthe regime couldn't analyze its real problems,
p299
aVand therefore it couldn't solve them.
p300
aVIn the end, the Stasi died
p301
aVbecause of the structures
p302
aVthat it was charged with protecting.
p303
aa(lp304
VThe ending of the Stasi
p305
aVwas something tragic,
p306
aVbecause these officers
p307
aVwere kept busy during the peaceful revolution
p308
aVwith only one thing:
p309
aVto destroy the documents
p310
aVthey had produced during decades.
p311
aVFortunately,
p312
aVthey had been stopped by human rights activists.
p313
aVThat's why today we can use the files
p314
aVto get a better understanding
p315
aVof how a surveillance state functions.
p316
aa(lp317
VThank you.
p318
aa(lp319
V(Applause)
p320
aa(lp321
VBruno Giussani: Thank you. Thank you very much.
p322
aVSo Hubertus, I want to ask you a couple of questions
p323
aVbecause I have here Der Spiegel from last week.
p324
aV"Mein Nachbar NSA." My neighbor, the NSA.
p325
aVAnd you just told us about my neighbor,
p326
aVthe spies and the informant from East Germany.
p327
aVSo there is a direct link between these two stories
p328
aVor there isn't?
p329
aVWhat's your reaction as a historian when you see this?
p330
aa(lp331
VHubertus Knabe: I think there are
p332
aVseveral aspects to mention.
p333
aVAt first, I think there's a difference
p334
aVof why you are collecting this data.
p335
aVAre you doing that for protecting your people
p336
aVagainst terrorist attacks,
p337
aVor are you doing that for oppressing your people?
p338
aVSo that makes a fundamental difference.
p339
aVBut on the other hand,
p340
aValso in a democracy, these instruments can be abused,
p341
aVand that is something where we really have
p342
aVto be aware to stop that,
p343
aVand that also the intelligence services
p344
aVare respecting the rules we have.
p345
aVThe third point, probably,
p346
aVwe really can be happy that we live in a democracy,
p347
aVbecause you can be sure that Russia and China
p348
aVare doing the same,
p349
aVbut nobody speaks about that
p350
aVbecause nobody could do that.
p351
aa(lp352
V(Applause)
p353
aa(lp354
VBG: When the story came out first,
p355
aVlast July, last year,
p356
aVyou filed a criminal complaint
p357
aVwith a German tribunal. Why?
p358
aVHK: Yeah, I did so because of the second point I mentioned,
p359
aVthat I think especially in a democracy,
p360
aVthe rules are for everybody.
p361
aVThey are made for everybody, so it's not allowed
p362
aVthat any institution doesn't respect the rules.
p363
aVIn the criminal code of Germany, it's written
p364
aVthat it's not allowed to tap somebody
p365
aVwithout the permission of the judge.
p366
aVFortunately, it's written in the criminal code of Germany,
p367
aVso if it's not respected, then I think
p368
aVan investigation is necessary,
p369
aVand it took a very long time that
p370
aVthe public prosecutor of Germany started this,
p371
aVand he started it only in the case of Angela Merkel,
p372
aVand not in the case of all the other people living in Germany.
p373
aa(lp374
VBG: That doesn't surprise me because \u2014
p375
aV(Applause) \u2014
p376
aVbecause of the story you told.
p377
aVSeen from the outside, I live outside of Germany,
p378
aVand I expected the Germans to react
p379
aVmuch more strongly, immediately.
p380
aVAnd instead, the reaction really came only
p381
aVwhen Chancellor Merkel was revealed
p382
aVas being wiretapped. Why so?
p383
aa(lp384
VHK: I take it as a good sign,
p385
aVbecause people feel secure in this democracy.
p386
aVThey aren't afraid that they will be arrested,
p387
aVand if you leave this hall after the conference,
p388
aVnobody has to be afraid that the secret police
p389
aVis standing out and is arresting you.
p390
aVSo that's a good sign, I think.
p391
aVPeople are not really scared, as they could be.
p392
aVBut of course, I think, the institutions
p393
aVare responsible to stop illegal actions
p394
aVin Germany or wherever they happen.
p395
aa(lp396
VBG: A personal question, and this is the last one.
p397
aVThere has been a debate in Germany about
p398
aVgranting asylum to Edward Snowden.
p399
aVWould you be in favor or against?
p400
aa(lp401
VHK: Oh, that's a difficult question,
p402
aVbut if you ask me,
p403
aVand if I answer honestly,
p404
aVI would give him the asylum,
p405
aVbecause I think it was really brave what he did,
p406
aVand he destroyed his whole life
p407
aVand his family and everything.
p408
aVSo I think, for these people, we should do something,
p409
aVand especially if you see the German history,
p410
aVwhere so many people had to escape
p411
aVand they asked for asylum in other countries
p412
aVand they didn't get it,
p413
aVso it would be a good sign to give him asylum.
p414
aa(lp415
V(Applause)
p416
aa(lp417
