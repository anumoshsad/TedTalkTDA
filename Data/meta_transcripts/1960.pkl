VSo a chip, a poet and a boy.
p4
aa(lp5
VIt's just about 20 years ago,
p6
aVJune 1994, when Intel announced
p7
aVthat there was a flaw
p8
aVat the core of their Pentium chip.
p9
aVDeep in the code of the SRT algorithm
p10
aVto calculate intermediate quotients necessary
p11
aVfor iterative floating points of divisions \u2014
p12
aVI don't know what that means, but  it's what it says on Wikipedia \u2014
p13
aVthere was a flaw and an error
p14
aVthat meant that there was a certain probability
p15
aVthat the result of the calculation would be an error,
p16
aVand the probability was one out of every
p17
aV360 billion calculations.
p18
aVSo Intel said your average spreadsheet
p19
aVwould be flawed once every 27,000 years.
p20
aVThey didn't think it was significant,
p21
aVbut there was an outrage in the community.
p22
aVThe community, the techies, said, this flaw
p23
aVhas to be addressed.
p24
aVThey were not going to stand by quietly
p25
aVas Intel gave them these chips.
p26
aVSo there was a revolution across the world.
p27
aVPeople marched to demand \u2014
p28
aVokay, not really exactly like that \u2014
p29
aVbut they rose up and they demanded
p30
aVthat Intel fix the flaw.
p31
aVAnd Intel set aside 475 million dollars
p32
aVto fund the replacement of millions of chips
p33
aVto fix the flaw.
p34
aVSo billions of dollars in our society
p35
aVwas spent to address a problem
p36
aVwhich would come once out of every 360 billion
p37
aVcalculations.
p38
aa(lp39
VNumber two, a poet.
p40
aVThis is Martin Niemöller.
p41
aVYou're familiar with his poetry.
p42
aVAround the height of the Nazi period,
p43
aVhe started repeating the verse,
p44
aV"First they came for the communists,
p45
aVand I did nothing,
p46
aVdid not speak out because I was not a communist.
p47
aVThen they came for the socialists.
p48
aVThen they came for the trade unions.
p49
aVThen they came for the Jews.
p50
aVAnd then they came for me.
p51
aVBut there was no one left to speak for me."
p52
aVNow, Niemöller is offering a certain kind of insight.
p53
aVThis is an insight at the core of intelligence.
p54
aVWe could call it cluefulness.
p55
aVIt's a certain kind of test:
p56
aVCan you recognize
p57
aVan underlying threat and respond?
p58
aVCan you save yourself or save your kind?
p59
aVTurns out ants are pretty good at this.
p60
aVCows, not so much.
p61
aVSo can you see the pattern?
p62
aVCan you see a pattern and then recognize
p63
aVand do something about it? Number two.
p64
aVNumber three, a boy.
p65
aVThis is my friend Aaron Swartz.
p66
aVHe's Tim's friend.
p67
aVHe's friends of many of you in this audience,
p68
aVand seven years ago,
p69
aVAaron came to me with a question.
p70
aVIt was just before I was going to give my first TED Talk.
p71
aVI was so proud. I was telling him about my talk,
p72
aV"Laws that choke creativity."
p73
aVAnd Aaron looked at me
p74
aVand was a little impatient, and he said,
p75
aV"So how are you ever
p76
aVgoing to solve the problems you're talking about?
p77
aVCopyright policy, Internet policy,
p78
aVhow are you ever going to address those problems
p79
aVso long as there's this fundamental corruption
p80
aVin the way our government works?"
p81
aa(lp82
VSo I was a little put off by this.
p83
aVHe wasn't sharing in my celebration.
p84
aVAnd I said to him, "You know, Aaron,
p85
aVit's not my field, not my field."
p86
aa(lp87
VHe said, "You mean as an academic, it's not your field?"
p88
aa(lp89
VI said, "Yeah, as an academic, it's not my field."
p90
aa(lp91
VHe said, "What about as a citizen?
p92
aVAs a citizen."
p93
aa(lp94
VNow, this is the way Aaron was.
p95
aVHe didn't tell. He asked questions.
p96
aVBut his questions spoke as clearly
p97
aVas my four-year-old's hug.
p98
aVHe was saying to me,
p99
aV"You've got to get a clue.
p100
aVYou have got to get a clue, because there is
p101
aVa flaw at the core of the operating system
p102
aVof this democracy,
p103
aVand it's not a flaw every one out of 360 billion times
p104
aVour democracy tries to make a decision.
p105
aVIt is every time,
p106
aVevery single important issue.
p107
aVWe've got to end the bovinity of this political society.
p108
aVWe've got to adopt, it turns out,
p109
aVthe word is fourmi-formatic attitude \u2014
p110
aVthat's what the Internet tells me the word is \u2014
p111
aVthe ant's appreciative attitude
p112
aVthat gets us to recognize this flaw,
p113
aVsave our kind and save our demos.
p114
aa(lp115
VNow if you know Aaron Swartz,
p116
aVyou know that we lost him
p117
aVjust over a year ago.
p118
aVIt was about six weeks
p119
aVbefore I gave my TED Talk,
p120
aVand I was so grateful to Chris
p121
aVthat he asked me to give this TED Talk,
p122
aVnot because I had the chance to talk to you,
p123
aValthough that was great,
p124
aVbut because it pulled me out of an extraordinary depression.
p125
aVI couldn't begin to describe the sadness.
p126
aVBecause I had to focus.
p127
aVI had to focus on, what was I going to say to you?
p128
aVIt saved me.
p129
aa(lp130
VBut after the buzz, the excitement,
p131
aVthe power that comes from this community,
p132
aVI began to yearn for a less sterile,
p133
aVless academic way to address these issues,
p134
aVthe issues that I was talking about.
p135
aVWe'd begun to focus on New Hampshire
p136
aVas a target for this political movement,
p137
aVbecause the primary in New Hampshire
p138
aVis so incredibly important.
p139
aVIt was a group called the New Hampshire Rebellion
p140
aVthat was beginning to talk about, how would we make
p141
aVthis issue of this corruption central in 2016?
p142
aVBut it was another soul that caught my imagination,
p143
aVa woman named Doris Haddock, aka Granny D.
p144
aVOn January 1, 1999, 15 years ago,
p145
aVat the age of 88, Granny D started a walk.
p146
aVShe started in Los Angeles
p147
aVand began to walk to Washington, D.C.
p148
aVwith a single sign on her chest that said,
p149
aV"campaign finance reform."
p150
aVEighteen months later,
p151
aVat the age of 90,
p152
aVshe arrived in Washington with hundreds following her,
p153
aVincluding many congressmen who had gotten in a car
p154
aVand driven out about a mile outside of the city
p155
aVto walk in with her.
p156
aV(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VNow, I don't have 13 months
p159
aVto walk across the country.
p160
aVI've got three kids who hate to walk,
p161
aVand a wife who, it turns out,
p162
aVstill hates when I'm not there
p163
aVfor mysterious reasons,
p164
aVso this was not an option,
p165
aVbut the question I asked,
p166
aVcould we remix Granny D a bit?
p167
aVWhat about a walk not of 3,200 miles
p168
aVbut of 185 miles across New Hampshire
p169
aVin January?
p170
aa(lp171
VSo on January 11,
p172
aVthe anniversary of Aaron's death,
p173
aVwe began a walk that ended on January 24th,
p174
aVthe day that Granny D was born.
p175
aVA total of 200 people joined us across this walk,
p176
aVas we went from the very top to the very bottom of New Hampshire
p177
aVtalking about this issue.
p178
aVAnd what was astonishing to me,
p179
aVsomething I completely did not expect to find,
p180
aVwas the passion and anger
p181
aVthat there was among everyone that we talked to about this issue.
p182
aVWe had found in a poll that 96 percent of Americans
p183
aVbelieve it important to reduce the influence
p184
aVof money in politics.
p185
aVNow politicians and pundits tell you,
p186
aVthere's nothing we can do about this issue,
p187
aVAmericans don't care about it,
p188
aVbut the reason for that is
p189
aVthat 91 percent of Americans
p190
aVthink there's nothing that can be done about this issue.
p191
aVAnd it's this gap between 96 and 91
p192
aVthat explains our politics of resignation.
p193
aVI mean, after all, at least 96 percent of us
p194
aVwish we could fly like Superman,
p195
aVbut because at least 91 percent of us believe we can't,
p196
aVwe don't leap off of tall buildings every time
p197
aVwe have that urge.
p198
aVThat's because we accept our limits,
p199
aVand so too with this reform.
p200
aVBut when you give people the sense of hope,
p201
aVyou begin to thaw that absolute sense of impossibility.
p202
aVAs Harvey Milk said, if you give 'em hope,
p203
aVyou give 'em a chance, a way to think
p204
aVabout how this change is possible.
p205
aVHope.
p206
aVAnd hope is the one thing that we, Aaron's friends,
p207
aVfailed him with, because we let him
p208
aVlose that sense of hope.
p209
aVI loved that boy like I love my son.
p210
aVBut we failed him.
p211
aVAnd I love my country,
p212
aVand I'm not going to fail that.
p213
aVI'm not going to fail that.
p214
aVThat sense of hope, we're going to hold,
p215
aVand we're going to fight for,
p216
aVhowever impossible this battle looks.
p217
aa(lp218
VWhat's next?
p219
aVWell, we started with this march with 200 people,
p220
aVand next year, there will be 1,000
p221
aVon different routes
p222
aVthat march in the month of January
p223
aVand meet in Concord to celebrate this cause,
p224
aVand then in 2016, before the primary,
p225
aVthere will be 10,000 who march across that state,
p226
aVmeeting in Concord to celebrate this cause.
p227
aVAnd as we have marched, people around the country
p228
aVhave begun to say, "Can we do the same thing
p229
aVin our state?"
p230
aVSo we've started a platform called G.D. Walkers,
p231
aVthat is, Granny D walkers,
p232
aVand Granny D walkers across the country
p233
aVwill be marching for this reform. Number one.
p234
aVNumber two, on this march,
p235
aVone of the founders of Thunderclap, David Cascino,
p236
aVwas with us,
p237
aVand he said, "Well what can we do?"
p238
aVAnd so they developed a platform,
p239
aVwhich we are announcing today,
p240
aVthat allows us to pull together voters
p241
aVwho are committed to this idea of reform.
p242
aVRegardless of where you are,
p243
aVin New Hampshire or outside of New Hampshire,
p244
aVyou can sign up and directly be informed
p245
aVwhere the candidates are on this issue
p246
aVso you can decide who to vote for
p247
aVas a function of which is going
p248
aVto make this possibility real.
p249
aVAnd then finally number three, the hardest.
p250
aVWe're in the age of the Super PAC.
p251
aVIndeed yesterday, Merriam announced
p252
aVthat Merriam-Webster will have Super PAC as a word.
p253
aVIt is now an official word in the dictionary.
p254
aVSo on May 1, aka May Day,
p255
aVwe're going to try an experiment.
p256
aVWe're going to try a launching
p257
aVof what we can think of as a Super PAC
p258
aVto end all Super PACs.
p259
aVAnd the basic way this works is this.
p260
aVFor the last year, we have been working
p261
aVwith analysts and political experts
p262
aVto calculate, how much would it cost
p263
aVto win enough votes in the United States Congress
p264
aVto make fundamental reform possible?
p265
aVWhat is that number? Half a billion? A billion?
p266
aVWhat is that number?
p267
aVAnd then whatever that number is,
p268
aVwe are going to kickstart, sort of,
p269
aVbecause you can't use KickStarter for political work,
p270
aVbut anyway, kickstart, sort of,
p271
aVfirst a bottom-up campaign
p272
aVwhere people will make small dollar commitments
p273
aVcontingent on reaching very ambitious goals,
p274
aVand when those goals have been reached,
p275
aVwe will turn to the large dollar contributors,
p276
aVto get them to contribute to make it possible
p277
aVfor us to run the kind of Super PAC necessary
p278
aVto win this issue,
p279
aVto change the way money influences politics,
p280
aVso that on November 8,
p281
aVwhich I discovered yesterday is the day
p282
aVthat Aaron would have been 30 years old,
p283
aVon November 8,
p284
aVwe will celebrate 218 representatives
p285
aVin the House and 60 Senators
p286
aVin the United States Senate
p287
aVwho have committed to this idea
p288
aVof fundamental reform.
p289
aa(lp290
VSo last night, we heard about wishes.
p291
aVHere's my wish.
p292
aVMay one.
p293
aVMay the ideals of one boy
p294
aVunite one nation behind one critical idea
p295
aVthat we are one people,
p296
aVwe are the people who were promised a government,
p297
aVa government that was promised to be
p298
aVdependent upon the people alone, the people,
p299
aVwho, as Madison told us,
p300
aVmeant not the rich more than the poor.
p301
aVMay one.
p302
aVAnd then may you, may you join this movement,
p303
aVnot because you're a politician,
p304
aVnot because you're an expert,
p305
aVnot because this is your field,
p306
aVbut because if you are,
p307
aVyou are a citizen.
p308
aVAaron asked me that.
p309
aVNow I've asked you.
p310
aa(lp311
VThank you very much.
