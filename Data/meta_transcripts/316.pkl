VSo I'm going to talk today about collecting stories
p4
aVin some unconventional ways.
p5
aVThis is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life.
p6
aVYou might enjoy the awkwardly tight, cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons.
p7
aVAnyway, it was a time when I was mainly interested
p8
aVin collecting imaginary stories.
p9
aVSo this is a picture of me
p10
aVholding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made.
p11
aVAnd recently I've been much more interested in collecting stories
p12
aVfrom reality \u2014 so, real stories.
p13
aVAnd specifically, I'm interested in collecting my own stories,
p14
aVstories from the Internet, and then recently, stories from life,
p15
aVwhich is kind of a new area of work that I've been doing recently.
p16
aVSo I'll be talking about each of those today.
p17
aVSo, first of all, my own stories. These are two of my sketchbooks.
p18
aVI have many of these books,
p19
aVand I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years.
p20
aVThey accompany me wherever I go in my life,
p21
aVand I fill them with all sorts of things,
p22
aVrecords of my lived experience:
p23
aVso watercolor paintings, drawings of what I see,
p24
aVdead flowers, dead insects, pasted ticket stubs, rusting coins,
p25
aVbusiness cards, writings.
p26
aVAnd in these books, you can find these short, little glimpses
p27
aVof moments and experiences and people that I meet.
p28
aVAnd, you know, after keeping these books for a number of years,
p29
aVI started to become very interested in collecting
p30
aVnot only my own personal artifacts,
p31
aVbut also the artifacts of other people.
p32
aVSo, I started collecting found objects.
p33
aVThis is a photograph I found lying in a gutter in New York City
p34
aVabout 10 years ago.
p35
aVOn the front, you can see the tattered black-and-white photo of a woman's face,
p36
aVand on the back it says, "To Judy, the girl with the Bill Bailey voice.
p37
aVHave fun in whatever you do."
p38
aVAnd I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life.
p39
aVAs opposed to knowing the whole story, just knowing a little bit of the story,
p40
aVand then letting your own mind fill in the rest.
p41
aVAnd that idea of a partial glimpse is something
p42
aVthat will come back in a lot of the work I'll be showing later today.
p43
aVSo, around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University,
p44
aVand I noticed that it was suddenly possible
p45
aVto collect these sorts of personal artifacts,
p46
aVnot just from street corners, but also from the Internet.
p47
aVAnd that suddenly, people, en masse, were leaving scores and scores
p48
aVof digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives.
p49
aVBlog posts, photographs, thoughts, feelings, opinions,
p50
aVall of these things were being expressed by people online,
p51
aVand leaving behind trails.
p52
aVSo, I started to write computer programs
p53
aVthat study very, very large sets of these online footprints.
p54
aVOne such project is about a year and a half old.
p55
aVIt's called "We Feel Fine."
p56
aVThis is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries
p57
aVevery two or three minutes, searching for occurrences of the phrases
p58
aV"I feel" and "I am feeling." And when it finds one of those phrases,
p59
aVit grabs the full sentence up to the period
p60
aVand also tries to identify demographic information about the author.
p61
aVSo, their gender, their age, their geographic location
p62
aVand what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence.
p63
aVIt collects about 20,000 such sentences a day
p64
aVand it's been running for about a year and a half,
p65
aVhaving collected over 10 and a half million feelings now.
p66
aVThis is, then, how they're presented.
p67
aVThese dots here represent some of the English-speaking world's
p68
aVfeelings from the last few hours,
p69
aVeach dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger.
p70
aVAnd the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside,
p71
aVso the bright ones are happy, and the dark ones are sad.
p72
aVAnd the diameter of each dot corresponds
p73
aVto the length of the sentence inside.
p74
aVSo the small ones are short, and the bigger ones are longer.
p75
aV"I feel fine with the body I'm in, there'll be no easy excuse
p76
aVfor why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend,"
p77
aVfrom a twenty-two-year-old in Japan.
p78
aV"I got this on some trading locally,
p79
aVbut really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap."
p80
aVAlso, some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts.
p81
aVAnd when that happens, these montage compositions are automatically created,
p82
aVwhich consist of the sentence and images being combined.
p83
aVAnd any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside.
p84
aV"I feel good."
p85
aV"I feel rough now, and I probably gained 100,000 pounds,
p86
aVbut it was worth it."
p87
aV"I love how they were able to preserve most in everything
p88
aVthat makes you feel close to nature \u2014 butterflies,
p89
aVman-made forests, limestone caves and hey, even a huge python."
p90
aVSo the next movement is called mobs.
p91
aVThis provides a slightly more statistical look at things.
p92
aVThis is showing the world's most common feelings overall right now,
p93
aVdominated by better, then bad, then good, then guilty, and so on.
p94
aVWeather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits
p95
aVof the weather they represent. So the sunny ones swirl around,
p96
aVthe cloudy ones float along, the rainy ones fall down,
p97
aVand the snowy ones flutter to the ground.
p98
aVYou can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside.
p99
aVFinally, location causes the feelings to move to their spots
p100
aVon a world map, giving you a sense of their geographic distribution.
p101
aVSo I'll show you now some of my favorite montages from "We Feel Fine."
p102
aVThese are the images that are automatically constructed.
p103
aV"I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe."
p104
aV(Laughter)
p105
aV"I've kissed numerous other boys and it hasn't felt good,
p106
aVthe kisses felt messy and wrong,
p107
aVbut kissing Lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual."
p108
aV"I can feel my cancer grow."
p109
aV"I feel pretty."
p110
aV"I feel skinny, but I'm not."
p111
aV"I'm 23, and a recovering meth and heroin addict,
p112
aVand feel absolutely blessed to still be alive."
p113
aV"I can't wait to see them racing for the first time at Daytona next month,
p114
aVbecause I feel the need for speed."
p115
aV(Laughter)
p116
aV"I feel sassy."
p117
aV"I feel so sexy in this new wig."
p118
aVAs you can see, "We Feel Fine" collects
p119
aVvery, very small-scale personal stories.
p120
aVSometimes, stories as short as two or three words.
p121
aVSo, really even challenging the notion
p122
aVof what can be considered a story.
p123
aVAnd recently, I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story.
p124
aVAnd that's led me to doing some work with the physical world,
p125
aVnot with the Internet,
p126
aVand only using the Internet at the very last moment, as a presentation medium.
p127
aVSo these are some newer projects that
p128
aVactually aren't even launched publicly yet.
p129
aVThe first such one is called "The Whale Hunt."
p130
aVLast May, I spent nine days living up in Barrow, Alaska,
p131
aVthe northernmost settlement in the United States,
p132
aVwith a family of Inupiat Eskimos,
p133
aVdocumenting their annual spring whale hunt.
p134
aVThis is the whaling camp here, we're about six miles from shore,
p135
aVcamping on five and a half feet of thick, frozen pack ice.
p136
aVAnd that water that you see there is the open lead,
p137
aVand through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime.
p138
aVAnd the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here,
p139
aVwaits for a whale to come close enough to attack. And when it does,
p140
aVit throws a harpoon at it, and then hauls the whale up
p141
aVunder the ice, and cuts it up.
p142
aVAnd that would provide the community's food supply for a long time.
p143
aVSo I went up there, and I lived with these guys
p144
aVout in their whaling camp here, and photographed the entire experience,
p145
aVbeginning with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York,
p146
aVand ending with the butchering of the second whale, seven and a half days later.
p147
aVI photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals.
p148
aVSo every five minutes, I took a photograph.
p149
aVWhen I was awake, with the camera around my neck.
p150
aVWhen I was sleeping, with a tripod and a timer.
p151
aVAnd then in moments of high adrenaline,
p152
aVlike when something exciting was happening,
p153
aVI would up that photographic frequency to as many as
p154
aV37 photographs in five minutes.
p155
aVSo what this created was a photographic heartbeat
p156
aVthat sped up and slowed down, more or less matching
p157
aVthe changing pace of my own heartbeat.
p158
aVThat was the first concept here.
p159
aVThe second concept was to use this experience to think about
p160
aVthe fundamental components of any story.
p161
aVWhat are the things that make up a story?
p162
aVSo, stories have characters. Stories have concepts.
p163
aVStories take place in a certain area. They have contexts.
p164
aVThey have colors. What do they look like?
p165
aVThey have time. When did it take place? Dates \u2014 when did it occur?
p166
aVAnd in the case of the whale hunt, also this idea of an excitement level.
p167
aVThe thing about stories, though, in most of the existing mediums
p168
aVthat we're accustomed to \u2014 things like novels, radio,
p169
aVphotographs, movies, even lectures like this one \u2014
p170
aVwe're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position,
p171
aVsome kind of omniscient, external body
p172
aVthrough whose eyes you see the story.
p173
aVWe're very used to this.
p174
aVBut if you think about real life, it's not like that at all.
p175
aVI mean, in real life, things are much more nuanced and complex,
p176
aVand there's all of these overlapping stories
p177
aVintersecting and touching each other.
p178
aVAnd so I thought it would be interesting to build a framework
p179
aVto surface those types of stories. So, in the case of "The Whale Hunt,"
p180
aVhow could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford,
p181
aVinvolving the concepts of wildlife, tools and blood, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,
p182
aVdominated by the color red, happening around 10 a.m. on May 3,
p183
aVwith an excitement level of high?
p184
aVSo, how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story?
p185
aVI built a web interface for viewing "The Whale Hunt" that attempts to do just this.
p186
aVSo these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there.
p187
aVThis is my studio in Brooklyn. This is the Arctic Ocean,
p188
aVand the butchering of the second whale, seven days later.
p189
aVYou can start to see some of the story here, told by color.
p190
aVSo this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper
p191
aVin the basement apartment where I was staying.
p192
aVAnd things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean.
p193
aVIntroduction of red down here, when whales are being cut up.
p194
aVYou can see a timeline, showing you the exciting moments throughout the story.
p195
aVThese are organized chronologically.
p196
aVWheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same,
p197
aVso these are also all the photographs organized chronologically.
p198
aVAnd any of these can be clicked,
p199
aVand then the narrative is entered at that position.
p200
aVSo here I am sleeping on the airplane heading up to Alaska.
p201
aVThat's "Moby Dick."
p202
aVThis is the food we ate.
p203
aVThis is in the Patkotak's family living room
p204
aVin their house in Barrow. The boxed wine they served us.
p205
aVCigarette break outside \u2014 I don't smoke.
p206
aVThis is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping.
p207
aVThis is out at whale camp, on the Arctic Ocean.
p208
aVThis graph that I'm clicking down here is meant to be
p209
aVreminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph,
p210
aVshowing the exciting moments of adrenaline.
p211
aVThis is the ice starting to freeze over. The snow fence they built.
p212
aVAnd so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories.
p213
aVSo, here you see the cast. These are all of the people in "The Whale Hunt"
p214
aVand the two whales that were killed down here.
p215
aVAnd we could do something as arbitrary as, say,
p216
aVextract the story of Rony, involving the concepts of blood
p217
aVand whales and tools, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,
p218
aVat Ahkivgaq camp, with the heartbeat level of fast.
p219
aVAnd now we've whittled down that whole story
p220
aVto just 29 matching photographs,
p221
aVand then we can enter the narrative at that position.
p222
aVAnd you can see Rony cutting up the whale here.
p223
aVThese whales are about 40 feet long,
p224
aVand weighing over 40 tons. And they provide the food source
p225
aVfor the community for much of the year.
p226
aVSkipping ahead a bit more here, this is Rony on the whale carcass.
p227
aVThey use no chainsaws or anything; it's entirely just blades,
p228
aVand an incredibly efficient process.
p229
aVThis is the guys on the rope, pulling open the carcass.
p230
aVThis is the muktuk, or the blubber, all lined up for community distribution.
p231
aVIt's baleen. Moving on.
p232
aVSo what I'm going to tell you about next
p233
aVis a very new thing. It's not even a project yet.
p234
aVSo, just yesterday, I flew in here from Singapore, and before that,
p235
aVI was spending two weeks in Bhutan, the small Himalayan kingdom
p236
aVnestled between Tibet and India.
p237
aVAnd I was doing a project there about happiness,
p238
aVinterviewing a lot of local people.
p239
aVSo Bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base
p240
aVmost of their high-level governmental decisions around the concept
p241
aVof gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product,
p242
aVand they've been doing this since the '70s.
p243
aVAnd it leads to just a completely different value system.
p244
aVIt's an incredibly non-materialistic culture,
p245
aVwhere people don't have a lot, but they're incredibly happy.
p246
aVSo I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas.
p247
aVSo, I did a number of things. I asked people a number of set questions,
p248
aVand took a number of set photographs,
p249
aVand interviewed them with audio, and also took pictures.
p250
aVI would start by asking people to rate their happiness
p251
aVbetween one and 10, which is kind of inherently absurd.
p252
aVAnd then when they answered, I would inflate that number of balloons
p253
aVand give them that number of balloons to hold.
p254
aVSo, you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons,
p255
aVand some really sad soul holding one balloon.
p256
aVBut you know, even holding one balloon is like, kind of happy.
p257
aV(Laughter)
p258
aVAnd then I would ask them a number of questions like
p259
aVwhat was the happiest day in their life, what makes them happy.
p260
aVAnd then finally, I would ask them to make a wish.
p261
aVAnd when they made a wish, I would write their wish
p262
aVonto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it.
p263
aVSo I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets
p264
aVof some of the interviews that I did, some of the people I spoke with.
p265
aVThis is an 11-year-old student.
p266
aVHe was playing cops and robbers with his friends, running around town,
p267
aVand they all had plastic toy guns.
p268
aVHis wish was to become a police officer.
p269
aVHe was getting started early. Those were his hands.
p270
aVI took pictures of everybody's hands,
p271
aVbecause I think you can often tell a lot about somebody
p272
aVfrom how their hands look. I took a portrait of everybody,
p273
aVand asked everybody to make a funny face.
p274
aVA 17-year-old student. Her wish was to have been born a boy.
p275
aVShe thinks that women have a pretty tough go of things in Bhutan,
p276
aVand it's a lot easier if you're a boy.
p277
aVA 28-year-old cell phone shop owner.
p278
aVIf you knew what Paro looked like, you'd understand
p279
aVhow amazing it is that there's a cell phone shop there.
p280
aVHe wanted to help poor people.
p281
aVA 53-year-old farmer. She was chaffing wheat,
p282
aVand that pile of wheat behind her
p283
aVhad taken her about a week to make.
p284
aVShe wanted to keep farming until she dies.
p285
aVYou can really start to see the stories told by the hands here.
p286
aVShe was wearing this silver ring that had the word "love" engraved on it,
p287
aVand she'd found it in the road somewhere.
p288
aVA 16-year-old quarry worker.
p289
aVThis guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight,
p290
aVbut he just wanted to spend his life as a farmer.
p291
aVA 21-year-old monk. He was very happy.
p292
aVHe wanted to live a long life at the monastery.
p293
aVHe had this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face,
p294
aVwhich I'm told is very good luck.
p295
aVHe was kind of too shy to make a funny face.
p296
aVA 16-year-old student.
p297
aVShe wanted to become an independent woman.
p298
aVI asked her about that, and she said she meant
p299
aVthat she doesn't want to be married,
p300
aVbecause, in her opinion, when you get married in Bhutan as a woman,
p301
aVyour chances to live an independent life kind of end,
p302
aVand so she had no interest in that.
p303
aVA 24-year-old truck driver.
p304
aVThere are these terrifyingly huge Indian trucks
p305
aVthat come careening around one-lane roads with two-lane traffic,
p306
aVwith 3,000-foot drop-offs right next to the road,
p307
aVand he was driving one of these trucks.
p308
aVBut all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life, like other people.
p309
aVA 24-year-old road sweeper. I caught her on her lunch break.
p310
aVShe'd built a little fire to keep warm, right next to the road.
p311
aVHer wish was to marry someone with a car.
p312
aVShe wanted a change in her life.
p313
aVShe lives in a little worker's camp right next to the road,
p314
aVand she wanted a different lot on things.
p315
aVAn 81-year-old itinerant farmer.
p316
aVI saw this guy on the side of the road,
p317
aVand he actually doesn't have a home.
p318
aVHe travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work,
p319
aVand then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at.
p320
aVSo his wish was to come with me, so that he had somewhere to live.
p321
aVHe had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his gho
p322
aVand started brandishing when I asked him to make a funny face.
p323
aVIt was all good-natured.
p324
aVA 10-year-old.
p325
aVHe wanted to join a school and learn to read,
p326
aVbut his parents didn't have enough money to send him to school.
p327
aVHe was eating this orange, sugary candy
p328
aVthat he kept dipping his fingers into,
p329
aVand since there was so much saliva on his hands,
p330
aVthis orange paste started to form on his palms.
p331
aV(Laughter)
p332
aVA 37-year-old road worker.
p333
aVOne of the more touchy political subjects in Bhutan
p334
aVis the use of Indian cheap labor
p335
aVthat they import from India to build the roads,
p336
aVand then they send these people home once the roads are built.
p337
aVSo these guys were in a worker's gang
p338
aVmixing up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway.
p339
aVHis wish was to make some money and open a store.
p340
aVA 75-year-old farmer. She was selling oranges on the side of the road.
p341
aVI asked her about her wish, and she said,
p342
aV"You know, maybe I'll live, maybe I'll die, but I don't have a wish."
p343
aVShe was chewing betel nut, which caused her teeth
p344
aVover the years to turn very red.
p345
aVFinally, this is a 26-year-old nun I spoke to.
p346
aVHer wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet.
p347
aVI asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said,
p348
aV"Well, you know, of course, it's impermanent,
p349
aVbut my plan is to live here until I'm 30, and then enter a hermitage."
p350
aVAnd I said, "You mean, like a cave?" And she said, "Yeah, like a cave."
p351
aVAnd I said, "Wow, and how long will you live in the cave?"
p352
aVAnd she said, "Well, you know,
p353
aVI think I'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave."
p354
aVI just thought that was amazing. I mean, she spoke in a way \u2014
p355
aVwith amazing English, and amazing humor, and amazing laughter \u2014
p356
aVthat made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into
p357
aVon the streets of New York, or in Vermont, where I'm from.
p358
aVBut here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years.
p359
aVI asked her a little bit more about the cave
p360
aVand what she planned would happen once she went there, you know.
p361
aVWhat if she saw the truth after just one year,
p362
aVwhat would she do for the next 35 years in her life?
p363
aVAnd this is what she said.
p364
aVWoman: I think I'm going to stay for 35. Maybe \u2014 maybe I'll die.
p365
aVJonathan Harris: Maybe you'll die? Woman: Yes.
p366
aVJH: 10 years? Woman: Yes, yes. JH: 10 years, that's a long time.
p367
aVWoman: Yes, not maybe one, 10 years, maybe I can die
p368
aVwithin one year, or something like that.
p369
aVJH: Are you hoping to?
p370
aVWoman: Ah, because you know, it's impermanent.
p371
aVJH: Yeah, but \u2014 yeah, OK. Do you hope \u2014
p372
aVwould you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years,
p373
aVor to live for one year?
p374
aVWoman: But I prefer for maybe 40 to 50.
p375
aVJH: 40 to 50? Yeah.
p376
aVWoman: Yes. From then, I'm going to the heaven.
p377
aVJH: Well, I wish you the best of luck with it.
p378
aVWoman: Thank you.
p379
aVJH: I hope it's everything that you hope it will be.
p380

aVwhen she was around 40. That was enough life for her.
p384
aVSo, the last thing we did, very quickly,
p385
aVis I took all those wish balloons \u2014 there were 117 interviews,
p386
aV117 wishes \u2014 and I brought them up to a place called Dochula,
p387
aVwhich is a mountain pass in Bhutan, at 10,300 feet,
p388
aVone of the more sacred places in Bhutan.
p389
aVAnd up there, there are thousands of prayer flags
p390
aVthat people have spread out over the years.
p391
aVAnd we re-inflated all of the balloons, put them up on a string,
p392
aVand hung them up there among the prayer flags.
p393
aVAnd they're actually still flying up there today.
p394
aVSo if any of you have any Bhutan travel plans in the near future,
p395
aVyou can go check these out. Here are some images from that.
p396
aVWe said a Buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true.
p397
aVYou can start to see some familiar balloons here.
