VI'm going to discuss with you three of my inventions
p4
aVthat can have an effect on 10 to a 100 million people,
p5
aVwhich we will hope to see happen.
p6
aVWe discussed, in the prior film, some of the old things that we did,
p7
aVlike stents and insulin pumps for the diabetic.
p8
aVAnd I'd like to talk very briefly about three new inventions
p9
aVthat will change the lives of many people.
p10
aa(lp11
VAt the present time, it takes an average of three hours
p12
aVafter the first symptoms of a heart attack are recognized by the patient,
p13
aVbefore that patient arrives at an emergency room.
p14
aVAnd people with silent ischemia \u2014
p15
aVwhich, translated into English, means they don't have any symptoms \u2014
p16
aVit takes even longer for them to get to the hospital.
p17
aVThe AMI, Acute Myocardial Infarction,
p18
aVwhich is a doctor's big word so they can charge you more money \u2014
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aV\u2014 means a heart attack. Annual incidence: 1.2 million Americans.
p21
aVMortality: 300,000 people dying each year.
p22
aVAbout half of them, 600,000, have permanent damage to their heart
p23
aVthat will cause them to have very bad problems later on.
p24
aVThus 900,000 people either have died
p25
aVor have significant damage to their heart muscle.
p26
aVSymptoms are often denied by the patient, particularly us men,
p27
aVbecause we are very brave. We are very brave,
p28
aVand we don't want to admit that I'm having a hell of a chest pain.
p29
aVThen, approximately 25 percent of all patients never have any symptoms.
p30
aVWhat are we going to do about them? How can we save their lives?
p31
aVIt's particularly true of diabetics and elderly women.
p32
aa(lp33
VWell, what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack?
p34
aVA means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery.
p35
aVThat, ladies and gentlemen, is a heart attack.
p36
aVThe means consist of noting something a little technical,
p37
aVST segment elevation of the electrogram \u2014
p38
aVtranslated into English, that means that
p39
aVif there's an electrical signal in the heart, and one part of the ECG \u2014
p40
aVwhich we call the ST segment \u2014 elevates,
p41
aVthat is a sure sign of a heart attack.
p42
aVAnd if we had a computer put into the body of a person who's at risk,
p43
aVwe could know, before they even have symptoms,
p44
aVthat they're having a heart attack, to save their life.
p45
aVWell, the doctor can program a level of this ST elevation voltage
p46
aVthat will trigger an emergency alarm,
p47
aVvibration like your cell phone, but right by your clavicle bone.
p48
aVAnd when it goes beep, beep, beep, you better do something about it,
p49
aVbecause if you want to live you have to get to some medical treatment.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo we have to try these devices out
p52
aVbecause the FDA won't just let us use them on people
p53
aVunless we try it out first,
p54
aVand the best model for this happens to be pigs.
p55
aVAnd what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin,
p56
aVlike you see in an emergency room,
p57
aVand I'm going to show you why they don't work very well.
p58
aVAnd then we put a lead, which is a wire, in the right ventricle inside the heart,
p59
aVwhich does the electrogram, which is the signal voltage from inside the heart.
p60
aVWell, with the pig, at the baseline,
p61
aVbefore we blocked the pig's artery to simulate a heart attack, that was the signal.
p62
aVAfter 43 seconds, even an expert couldn't tell the difference,
p63
aVand after three minutes \u2014 well,
p64
aVif you really studied it, you'd see a difference.
p65
aVBut what happened when we looked inside the pig's heart, to the electrogram?
p66
aa(lp67
VThere was the baseline \u2014 first of all, a much bigger and more reliable signal.
p68
aVSecond of all, I'll bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference,
p69
aVand we see here an ST segment elevation right after this sharp line.
p70
aVLook at the difference there. It doesn't take much \u2014
p71
aVevery layperson could see that difference,
p72
aVand computers can be programmed to easily detect it.
p73
aVThen, look at that after three minutes.
p74
aVWe see that the signal that's actually in the heart,
p75
aVwe can use it to tell people that they're having a heart attack
p76
aVeven before they have symptoms so we can save their life.
p77
aa(lp78
VThen we tried it with my son, Dr. Tim Fischell,
p79
aVwe tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in.
p80
aVWell, he kept the balloon filled to block the artery,
p81
aVto simulate a blockage, which is what a heart attack is.
p82
aVAnd it's not hard to see that \u2014 the baseline
p83
aVis the first picture on the upper left.
p84
aVNext to it, at 30 seconds, you see this rise here,
p85
aVthen this rise \u2014 that's the ST elevation.
p86
aVAnd if we had a computer that could detect it,
p87
aVwe could tell you you're having a heart attack so early
p88
aVit could save your life and prevent congestive heart failure.
p89
aVAnd then he did it again. We filled the balloon again a few minutes later
p90
aVand here you see, even after 10 seconds, a great rise in this piece,
p91
aVwhich we can have computers inside, under your chest like a pacemaker,
p92
aVwith a wire into your heart like a pacemaker.
p93
aVAnd computers don't go to sleep.
p94
aVWe have a little battery and on this little battery
p95
aVthat computer will run for five years without needing replacement.
p96
aa(lp97
VWhat does the system look like?
p98
aVWell, on the left is the IMD, which is Implantable Medical Device,
p99
aVand tonight in the tent you can see it \u2014 they've exhibited it.
p100
aVIt's about this big, the size of a pacemaker.
p101
aVIt's implanted with very conventional techniques.
p102
aVAnd the EXD is an External Device that you can have on your night table.
p103
aVIt'll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room
p104
aVwhen the thing goes off because, if you don't, you're in deep doo-doo.
p105
aVAnd then, finally, a programmer that will set the level of the stimulation,
p106
aVwhich is the level which says you are having a heart attack.
p107
aa(lp108
VThe FDA says, OK, test this final device after it's built in some animal,
p109
aVwhich we said is a pig, so we had to get this pig to have a heart attack.
p110
aVAnd when you go to the farmyard, you can't easily get pigs to have heart attacks,
p111
aVso we said, well, we're experts in stents.
p112
aVTonight you'll see some of our invented stents.
p113
aVWe said, so we'll put in a stent,
p114
aVbut we're not going to put in a stent that we'd put in people.
p115
aVWe're putting in a copper stent,
p116
aVand this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attacks.
p117
aVThat's not very nice, but, after all, we had to find out what the answer is.
p118
aVSo we took two copper stents and we put it in the artery of this pig,
p119
aVand let me show you the result that's very gratifying
p120
aVas far as people who have heart disease are concerned.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo there it was, Thursday morning we stopped the pig's medication
p123
aVand there is his electrogram, the signal from inside the pig's heart
p124
aVcoming out by radio telemetry.
p125
aVThen, on Friday at 6:43, he began to get certain signs,
p126
aVwhich later we had the pig run around \u2014
p127
aVI'm not going to go into this early stage.
p128
aVBut look what happened at 10:06 after we removed this pig's medication
p129
aVthat kept him from having a heart attack.
p130
aVAny one of you now is an expert on ST elevation. Can you see it there?
p131
aVCan you see it in the picture after the big rise of the QRS \u2014 you see ST elevation?
p132
aVThis pig at 10:06 was having a heart attack.
p133
aVWhat happens after you have the heart attack, this blockage?
p134
aVYour rhythm becomes irregular, and that's what happened 45 minutes later.
p135
aVThen, ventricular fibrillation, the heart quivers instead of beats \u2014
p136
aVthis is just before death of the pig \u2014 and then the pig died; it went flat-line.
p137
aVBut we had a little bit over an hour where we could've saved this pig's life.
p138
aVWell, because of the FDA, we didn't save the pig's life,
p139
aVbecause we need to do this type of animal research for humans.
p140
aVBut when it comes to the sake of a human, we can save their life.
p141
aVWe can save the lives of people who are at high risk for a heart attack.
p142
aa(lp143
VWhat is the response to acute myocardial infarction, a heart attack, today?
p144
aVWell, you feel some chest pain or indigestion.
p145
aVIt's not all that bad; you decide not to do anything.
p146
aVSeveral hours pass and it gets worse, and even the man won't ignore it.
p147
aVFinally, you go to the emergency room.
p148
aVYou wait as burns and other critical patients are treated,
p149
aVbecause 75 percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains
p150
aVdon't have AMI, so you're not taken very seriously.
p151
aVThey finally see you. It takes more time
p152
aVto get your electrocardiogram on your skin and diagnose it,
p153
aVand it's hard to do because they don't have the baseline data,
p154
aVwhich the computer we put in you gets.
p155
aVFinally, if you're lucky, you are treated in three or four hours after the incident,
p156
aVbut the heart muscle has died.
p157
aVAnd that is the typical treatment in the advanced world \u2014 not Africa \u2014
p158
aVthat's the typical treatment in the advanced world today.
p159
aa(lp160
VSo we developed the AngelMed Guardian System
p161
aVand we have a device inside this patient, called the Implanted AngelMed Guardian.
p162
aVAnd when you have a blockage, the alarm goes off
p163
aVand it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device,
p164
aVwhich gets your baseline electrogram from 24 hours ago
p165
aVand the one that caused the alarm, so you can take it to the emergency room
p166
aVand show them, and say, take care of me right away.
p167
aVThen it goes to a network operations center,
p168
aVwhere they get your data from your patient database
p169
aVthat's been put in at some central location, say, in the United States.
p170
aVThen it goes to a diagnostic center, and within one minute of your heart attack,
p171
aVyour signal appears on the screen of a computer
p172
aVand the computer analyzes what your problem is.
p173
aVAnd the person who's there, the medical practitioner, calls you \u2014
p174
aVthis is also a cell phone \u2014 and says,
p175
aV"Mr. Smith, you're in deep doo-doo; you have a problem.
p176
aVWe've called the ambulance. The ambulance is on the way.
p177
aVIt'll pick you up, and then we're going to call your doctor, tell him about it.
p178
aVWe're going to send him the signal that we have, that says you have a heart attack,
p179
aVand we're going to send the signal to the hospital
p180
aVand we're going to have it analyzed there,
p181
aVand there you're going to be with your doctor
p182
aVand you'll be taken care of so you won't die of a heart attack."
p183
aVThat's the first invention that I wanted to describe.
p184
aV(Applause)
p185
aa(lp186
VAnd now I want to talk about something entirely different.
p187
aVAt first I didn't think migraine headaches were a big problem
p188
aVbecause I'd never had a migraine headache,
p189
aVbut then I spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life,
p190
aVand their lives are being totally ruined by it.
p191
aVWe have a mission statement for our company doing migraine, which is,
p192
aV"Prevent or ameliorate migraine headaches
p193
aVby the application of a safe, controlled magnetic pulse
p194
aVapplied, as needed, by the patient."
p195
aVNow, you're probably very few physicists here.
p196
aVIf you're a physicist you'd know there's a certain Faraday's Law,
p197
aVwhich says if I apply a magnetic pulse on salt water \u2014
p198
aVthat's your brains by the way \u2014
p199
aVit'll generate electric currents, and the electric current in the brain
p200
aVcan erase a migraine headache.
p201
aVThat's what we have discovered.
p202
aa(lp203
VSo here's a picture of what we're doing.
p204
aVThe patients who have a migraine preceded by an aura
p205
aVhave a band of excited neurons \u2014 that's shown in red \u2014
p206
aVthat moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the mid-brain.
p207
aVAnd when it hits the mid-brain, that's when the headache begins.
p208
aVThere's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura,
p209
aVand this visual aura, by the way \u2014 and I'll show you a picture \u2014
p210
aVbut it sort of begins with little dancing lights,
p211
aVgets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field.
p212
aVAnd what we tried was this; here is a device called the Cadwell Model MES10.
p213
aVWeighs about 70 pounds, has a wire about an inch in diameter.
p214
aVAnd here's one of the patients who has an aura
p215
aVand always has a headache, bad one, after the aura. What do we do?
p216
aa(lp217
VThis is what an aura looks like.
p218
aVIt's sort of funny dancing lights, shown there on the left and right side.
p219
aVAnd that's a fully developed visual aura, as we see on top.
p220
aVIn the middle, our experimentalist, the neurologist, who said,
p221
aV"I'm going to move this down a little and I'm going to erase half your aura."
p222
aVAnd, by God, the neurologist did erase it, and that's the middle picture:
p223
aVhalf of the aura erased by a short magnetic pulse.
p224
aVWhat does that mean?
p225
aVThat means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric current
p226
aVthat's interfering with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain.
p227
aVAnd finally he says, "OK, now I'm going to \u2014 "
p228
aVall of the aura get erased with an appropriately placed magnetic pulse.
p229
aa(lp230
VWhat is the result? We designed a magnetic depolarizer
p231
aVthat looks like this, that you could have \u2014 a lady, in her pocket book \u2014
p232
aVand when you get an aura you can try it and see how it works.
p233
aVWell, the next thing they have to show is what was on ABC News,
p234
aVChannel 7, last week in New York City, in the 11 o'clock news.
p235
aa(lp236
VAnchor: For anyone who suffers from migraine headaches \u2014
p237
aVand there are 30 million Americans who do \u2014 tonight: a possible answer.
p238
aVEyewitness news reporter Stacy Sager tonight, with a small and portable machine
p239
aVthat literally zaps your migraines away.
p240
aVChristina Sidebottom: Well, my first reaction was that it was \u2014
p241
aVlooked awfully gun-like, and it was very strange.
p242
aVStacy Sager: But for Christina Sidebottom, almost anything was worth trying
p243
aVif it could stop a migraine.
p244
aVIt may look silly or even frightening as you walk around with it in your purse,
p245
aVbut researchers here in Ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper,
p246
aVsay it is scientifically sound \u2014
p247
aVthat, in fact, when the average person gets a migraine,
p248
aVit's caused by something similar to an electrical impulse.
p249
aVThe zapper creates a magnetic field to counteract that.
p250
aVYousef Mohammed: In other words, we're treating electricity with electricity,
p251
aVrather than treating electricity with the chemicals that we're using nowadays.
p252
aVSS: But is it safe to use everyday?
p253
aVExperts say the research has actually been around for more than a decade,
p254
aVand more long-term studies need to be done. Christina now swears by it.
p255
aVCS: It's been the most wonderful thing for my migraine.
p256
aVSS: Researchers are hoping to present their studies to the FDA this summer.
p257
aa(lp258
VRobert Fischell: And that is the invention to treat migraines.
p259
aV(Applause)
p260
aVYou see, the problem is, 30 million Americans have migraine headaches,
p261
aVand we need a means to treat it, and I think that we now have it.
p262
aVAnd this is the first device that we did, and I'm going to talk about my second wish,
p263
aVwhich has something to do with this.
p264
aVOur conclusions from our studies so far, at three research centers,
p265
aVis there is a marked improvement in pain levels after using it just once.
p266
aVThe most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times,
p267
aVand the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches,
p268
aVnot only those with aura, get treated and get diminished.
p269
aVAnd auras can be erased and the migraine, then, does not occur.
p270
aVAnd that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on.
p271
aV(Applause)
p272
aa(lp273
VThe third and last invention began with an idea.
p274
aVEpilepsy can best be treated by responsive electrical stimulation.
p275
aVNow, why do we use \u2014 add on, nearly, an epileptic focus?
p276
aVNow, unfortunately, us technical people, unlike Mr. Bono,
p277
aVhave to get into all these technical words.
p278
aVWell, "responsive electrical stimulation" means
p279
aVthat we sense, at a place in your brain which is called an "epileptic focus,"
p280
aVwhich is where the epileptic seizure begins \u2014
p281
aVwe sense there, that it's going to happen,
p282
aVand then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot,
p283
aVwhich erases the errant signal
p284
aVso that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache.
p285
aVWe use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that's used for the heart.
p286
aVWe thought we could adapt it for the brain.
p287
aVThe device could be implanted under the scalp
p288
aVto be totally hidden and avoid wire breakage,
p289
aVwhich occurs if you put it in the chest and you try to move your neck around.
p290
aVForm a company to develop a neuro-pacemaker for epilepsy,
p291
aVas well as other diseases of the brain, because all diseases of the brain
p292
aVare a result of some electrical malfunction in it,
p293
aVthat causes many, if not all, of brain disorders.
p294
aa(lp295
VWe formed a company called NeuroPace
p296
aVand we started work on responsive neurostimulation,
p297
aVand this is a picture of what the device looked like,
p298
aVthat's placed into the cranial bone.
p299
aVThis is probably a better picture.
p300
aVHere we have our device in which we put in a frame.
p301
aVThere's a cut made in the scalp; it's opened; the neurosurgeon has a template;
p302
aVhe marks it around, and uses a dental burr
p303
aVto remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of our device.
p304
aVAnd tonight, you'll be able to see the device in the tent.
p305
aVAnd then with four screws, we put in a frame,
p306
aVthen we snap in the device and we run with wires \u2014
p307
aVthe one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes,
p308
aVto the epileptic focus, the origin of the epilepsy,
p309
aVwhere we can sense the electrical signal
p310
aVand have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current
p311
aVto prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure.
p312
aVIn the blue wire, we see what's called a deep brain electrode.
p313
aVIf that's the source of the epilepsy, we can attack that as well.
p314
aa(lp315
VThe comprehensive solution: this is the device;
p316
aVit's about one inches by two inches and, oddly enough,
p317
aVjust the thickness of most cranial bones.
p318
aVThe advantages of responsive neurostimulation:
p319
aVIt can detect and terminate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur,
p320
aVprovide stimulation only when needed,
p321
aVcan be turned off if seizures disappear; it has minimal side effects \u2014
p322
aVas a matter of fact, in all our clinical trials to date,
p323
aVwe've seen no side effects in the 40 or so patients in whom it's been implanted \u2014
p324
aVand it's invisible, cosmetically hidden,
p325
aVso, if you have epilepsy and you have the device,
p326
aVno one will know it because you can't tell that it's there.
p327
aVAnd this shows what an electroencephalogram is,
p328
aVand on the left is the signal of a spontaneous seizure of one of the patients.
p329
aVThen we stimulated, and you see how that heavy black line
p330
aVand then you see the electroencephalogram signal going to normal,
p331
aVwhich means they did not get the epileptic seizure.
p332
aVThat concludes my discussion of epilepsy,
p333
aVwhich is the third invention that I want to discuss here this afternoon.
p334
aV(Applause)
p335
aa(lp336
VI have three wishes. Well, I can't do much about Africa.
p337
aVI'm a tech; I'm into medical gadgetry,
p338
aVwhich is mostly high-tech stuff like Mr. Bono talked about.
p339
aVThe first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator,
p340
aVcalled RNS, for Responsive NeuroStimulator \u2014 that's a brilliant acronym \u2014
p341
aVfor the treatment of other brain disorders.
p342
aVWell, if we're going to do it for epilepsy, why the hell not try it for something else?
p343
aVThen you saw what that device looked like,
p344
aVthat the woman was using to fix her migraines?
p345
aVI tell you this: that's something which some research engineer like me would concoct,
p346
aVnot a real designer of good equipment.
p347
aV(Laughter)
p348
aVWe want to have some people, who really know how to do this,
p349
aVperform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design
p350
aVfor the portable device for treating migraine headaches.
p351
aVAnd some of the sponsors of this TED meeting are such organizations.
p352
aVThen we're going to challenge the TED attendees
p353
aVto come up with a way to improve health care in the USA,
p354
aVwhere we have problems that Africa doesn't have.
p355
aVAnd by reducing malpractice litigation \u2014
p356
aVmalpractice litigation is not an African problem; it's an American problem.
p357
aV(Applause)
p358
aa(lp359
VSo, to get quickly to my first wish \u2014
p360
aVthe brain operates by electrical signals.
p361
aVIf the electrical signals create a brain disorder,
p362
aVelectro-stimulation can overcome that disorder by acting on the brain's neurons.
p363
aVIn other words, if you've screwed up electrical signals,
p364
aVmaybe, by putting other electrical signals from a computer in the brain,
p365
aVwe can counteract that.
p366
aVA signal in the brain that triggers brain dysfunction
p367
aVmight be sensed as a trigger for electro-stimulation
p368
aVlike we're doing with epilepsy.
p369
aVBut even if there is no signal,
p370
aVelectro-stimulation of an appropriate part of the brain can turn off a brain disorder.
p371
aVAnd consider treating psychotic disorders \u2014
p372
aVand I want this involved with the TED group \u2014
p373
aVsuch as obsessive-compulsive disorder
p374
aVthat, presently, is not well treated with drugs, and includes five million Americans.
p375
aVAnd Mr. Fischer, and his group at NeuroPace, and myself believe
p376
aVthat we can have a dramatic effect in improving OCD in America and in the world.
p377
aVThat is the first wish.
p378
aV(Applause)
p379
aa(lp380
VThe second wish is, at the present time,
p381
aVthe clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulators \u2014
p382
aVthat's what TMS means, device to treat migraine headaches \u2014
p383
aVappears to be quite successful.
p384
aVWell, that's the good news.
p385
aVThe present portable device is far from optimally designed,
p386
aVboth as to human factors as appearance.
p387
aVI think she said it looks like a gun. A lot of people don't like guns.
p388
aV(Laughter)
p389
aVEngage a company having prior successes
p390
aVfor human factors engineering and industrial design
p391
aVto optimize the design of the first portable TMS device
p392
aVthat will be sold to the patients who have migraine headaches.
p393
aVAnd that is the second wish.
p394
aV(Applause)
p395
aa(lp396
VAnd, of the 100,000-dollar prize money, that TED was so generous to give me,
p397
aVI am donating 50,000 dollars to the NeuroPace people
p398
aVto get on with the treatment of OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
p399
aVand I'm making another 50,000 available for a company
p400
aVto optimize the design of the device for migraines.
p401
aVAnd that's how I'll use my 100,000-dollar prize money.
p402
aV(Applause)
p403
aa(lp404
VWell, the third and final wish is somewhat \u2014
p405
aVunfortunately, it's much more complicated because it involves lawyers.
p406
aV(Laughter)
p407
aVWell, medical malpractice litigation in the US
p408
aVhas escalated the cost of malpractice insurance,
p409
aVso that competent physicians are leaving their practice.
p410
aVLawyers take cases on contingency with the hope of a big share
p411
aVof a big settlement by a sympathetic jury, because this patient really ended up badly.
p412
aVThe high cost of health care in the US is partly due to litigation and insurance costs.
p413
aVI've seen pictures, graphs in today's USA Today
p414
aVshowing it skyrocketing out of control, and this is one factor.
p415
aVWell, how can the TED community help with this situation?
p416
aa(lp417
VI have a couple of ideas to begin with.
p418
aVAs a starting point for discussion with the TED group,
p419
aVa major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent
p420
aVof informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign.
p421
aVFor example, I asked the epilepsy people
p422
aVwhat are they using for informed consent.
p423
aVWould you believe, 12 pages, single space,
p424
aVthe patient has to read before they're in our trial to cure their epilepsy?
p425
aVWhat do you think someone has at the end of reading 12 single-spaced pages?
p426
aVThey don't understand what the hell it's about.
p427
aV(Laughter)
p428
aVThat's the present system. How about making a video?
p429
aVWe have entertainment people here;
p430
aVwe have people who know how to do videos,
p431
aVwith visual presentation of the anatomy and procedure done with animation.
p432
aVEverybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing
p433
aVthat can be interactive with the patient, where they see the video
p434
aVand they're being videoed and they press, do you understand this? No, I don't.
p435
aVWell, then let's go to a simpler explanation.
p436
aVThen there's a simpler one and, oh yes, I understand that.
p437
aVWell, press the button and you're on record, you understand.
p438
aVAnd that is one of the ideas.
p439
aa(lp440
VNow, also a video is done of the patient or spouse and medical presenter,
p441
aVwith the patient agreeing that he understands the procedure to be done,
p442
aVincluding all the possible failure modes.
p443
aVThe patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuit
p444
aVif one of the known procedure failures occurs.
p445
aVNow, in America, in fact, you cannot give up your right to trial by jury.
p446
aVHowever, if a video is there that everything was explained to you,
p447
aVand you have it all in the video file,
p448
aVit'll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer
p449
aVwill take this case on contingency, because it won't be nearly as good a case.
p450
aVIf a medical error occurs, the patient or spouse agrees to a settlement
p451
aVfor fair compensation by arbitration instead of going to court.
p452
aVThat would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the United States
p453
aVand would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone.
p454
aa(lp455
VThese are just some starting points.
p456
aVAnd, so there, that's the end of all my wishes.
p457
aVI wish I had more wishes but three is what I've got and there they are.
