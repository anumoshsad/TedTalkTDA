VI want to talk a little bit today about labor and work.
p4
aa(lp5
VWhen we think about how people work,
p6
aVthe naive intuition we have
p7
aVis that people are like rats in a maze \u2014
p8
aVthat all people care about is money,
p9
aVand the moment we give them money,
p10
aVwe can direct them to work one way,
p11
aVwe can direct them to work another way.
p12
aVThis is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways.
p13
aVAnd we really have this incredibly simplistic view
p14
aVof why people work, and what the labor market looks like.
p15
aa(lp16
VAt the same time, if you think about it,
p17
aVthere's all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around us.
p18
aVThink about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing.
p19
aVIf you read books of people who climb mountains, difficult mountains,
p20
aVdo you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness?
p21
aVNo, they are full of misery.
p22
aVIn fact, it's all about frostbite and having difficulty walking,
p23
aVand difficulty breathing \u2014
p24
aVcold, challenging circumstances.
p25
aVAnd if people were just trying to be happy,
p26
aVthe moment they would get to the top,
p27
aVthey would say, "This was a terrible mistake.
p28
aVI'll never do it again."
p29
aa(lp30
V(Laughter)
p31
aa(lp32
V"Instead, let me sit on a beach somewhere drinking mojitos."
p33
aVBut instead, people go down,
p34
aVand after they recover, they go up again.
p35
aVAnd if you think about mountain climbing as an example,
p36
aVit suggests all kinds of things.
p37
aVIt suggests that we care about reaching the end, a peak.
p38
aVIt suggests that we care about the fight, about the challenge.
p39
aVIt suggests that there's all kinds of other things that motivate us
p40
aVto work or behave in all kinds of ways.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd for me personally, I started thinking about this
p43
aVafter a student came to visit me.
p44
aVThis was one of my students from a few years earlier,
p45
aVand he came one day back to campus.
p46
aVAnd he told me the following story:
p47
aVHe said that for more than two weeks,
p48
aVhe was working on a PowerPoint presentation.
p49
aVHe was working in a big bank,
p50
aVand this was in preparation for a merger and acquisition.
p51
aVAnd he was working very hard on this presentation \u2014
p52
aVgraphs, tables, information.
p53
aVHe stayed late at night every day.
p54
aVAnd the day before it was due,
p55
aVhe sent his PowerPoint presentation to his boss,
p56
aVand his boss wrote him back and said,
p57
aV"Nice presentation, but the merger is canceled."
p58
aVAnd the guy was deeply depressed.
p59
aVNow at the moment when he was working,
p60
aVhe was actually quite happy.
p61
aVEvery night he was enjoying his work,
p62
aVhe was staying late, he was perfecting this PowerPoint presentation.
p63
aVBut knowing that nobody would ever watch it made him quite depressed.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo I started thinking about how do we experiment
p66
aVwith this idea of the fruits of our labor.
p67
aVAnd to start with, we created a little experiment
p68
aVin which we gave people Legos,
p69
aVand we asked them to build with Legos.
p70
aVAnd for some people, we gave them Legos and we said,
p71
aV"Hey, would you like to build this Bionicle for three dollars?
p72
aVWe'll pay you three dollars for it."
p73
aVAnd people said yes, and they built with these Legos.
p74
aVAnd when they finished, we took it, we put it under the table,
p75
aVand we said, "Would you like to build another one,
p76
aVthis time for $2.70?"
p77
aVIf they said yes, we gave them another one,
p78
aVand when they finished, we asked them,
p79
aV"Do you want to build another one?" for $2.40, $2.10, and so on,
p80
aVuntil at some point people said,
p81
aV"No more. It's not worth it for me."
p82
aVThis was what we called the meaningful condition.
p83
aVPeople built one Bionicle after another.
p84
aVAfter they finished every one of them,
p85
aVwe put them under the table.
p86
aVAnd we told them that at the end of the experiment,
p87
aVwe will take all these Bionicles, we will disassemble them,
p88
aVwe will put them back in the boxes,
p89
aVand we will use it for the next participant.
p90
aa(lp91
VThere was another condition.
p92
aVThis other condition was inspired by David, my student.
p93
aVAnd this other condition we called the Sisyphic condition.
p94
aVAnd if you remember the story about Sisyphus,
p95
aVSisyphus was punished by the gods to push the same rock up a hill,
p96
aVand when he almost got to the end,
p97
aVthe rock would roll over, and he would have to start again.
p98
aVAnd you can think about this as the essence of doing futile work.
p99
aVYou can imagine that if he pushed the rock on different hills,
p100
aVat least he would have some sense of progress.
p101
aVAlso, if you look at prison movies,
p102
aVsometimes the way that the guards torture the prisoners
p103
aVis to get them to dig a hole, and when the prisoner is finished,
p104
aVthey ask him to fill the hole back up and then dig again.
p105
aVThere's something about this cyclical version
p106
aVof doing something over and over and over
p107
aVthat seems to be particularly demotivating.
p108
aa(lp109
VSo in the second condition of this experiment,
p110
aVthat's exactly what we did.
p111
aVWe asked people,
p112
aV"Would you like to build one Bionicle for three dollars?"
p113
aVAnd if they said yes, they built it.
p114
aVThen we asked them, "Do you want to build another one for $2.70?"
p115
aVAnd if they said yes, we gave them a new one,
p116
aVand as they were building it,
p117
aVwe took apart the one that they just finished.
p118
aVAnd when they finished that,
p119
aVwe said, "Would you like to build another one,
p120
aVthis time for 30 cents less?"
p121
aVAnd if they said yes,
p122
aVwe gave them the one that they built and we broke.
p123
aVSo this was an endless cycle of them building,
p124
aVand us destroying in front of their eyes.
p125
aa(lp126
VNow what happens when you compare these two conditions?
p127
aVThe first thing that happened was that people built many more Bionicles \u2014
p128
aVeleven in the meaningful condition,
p129
aVversus seven in the Sisyphus condition.
p130
aVAnd by the way, we should point out that this was not big meaning.
p131
aVPeople were not curing cancer or building bridges.
p132
aVPeople were building Bionicles for a few cents.
p133
aVAnd not only that, everybody knew
p134
aVthat the Bionicles would be destroyed quite soon.
p135
aVSo there was not a real opportunity for big meaning.
p136
aVBut even the small meaning made a difference.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow we had another version of this experiment.
p139
aVIn this other version of the experiment,
p140
aVwe didn't put people in this situation,
p141
aVwe just described to them the situation,
p142
aVmuch as I am describing to you now,
p143
aVand we asked them to predict what the result would be.
p144
aVWhat happened?
p145
aVPeople predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude.
p146
aVPeople who were just given the description of the experiment
p147
aVsaid that in the meaningful condition,
p148
aVpeople would probably build one more Bionicle.
p149
aVSo people understand that meaning is important,
p150
aVthey just don't understand the magnitude of the importance,
p151
aVthe extent to which it's important.
p152
aa(lp153
VThere was one other piece of data we looked at.
p154
aVIf you think about it, there are some people who love Legos,
p155
aVand some people who don't.
p156
aVAnd you would speculate that the people who love Legos
p157
aVwould build more Legos, even for less money,
p158
aVbecause after all, they get more internal joy from it.
p159
aVAnd the people who love Legos less would build less Legos
p160
aVbecause the enjoyment that they derive from it is lower.
p161
aVAnd that's actually what we found in the meaningful condition.
p162
aVThere was a very nice correlation between the love of Legos
p163
aVand the amount of Legos people built.
p164
aa(lp165
VWhat happened in the Sisyphic condition?
p166
aVIn that condition, the correlation was zero \u2014
p167
aVthere was no relationship between the love of Legos,
p168
aVand how much people built,
p169
aVwhich suggests to me that with this manipulation
p170
aVof breaking things in front of people's eyes,
p171
aVwe basically crushed any joy that they could get out of this activity.
p172
aVWe basically eliminated it.
p173
aa(lp174
VSoon after I finished running this experiment,
p175
aVI went to talk to a big software company in Seattle.
p176
aVI can't tell you who they were, but they were a big company in Seattle.
p177
aVThis was a group within the software company
p178
aVthat was put in a different building,
p179
aVand they asked them to innovate,
p180
aVand create the next big product for this company.
p181
aVAnd the week before I showed up,
p182
aVthe CEO of this big software company went to that group, 200 engineers,
p183
aVand canceled the project.
p184
aVAnd I stood there in front of 200
p185
aVof the most depressed people I've ever talked to.
p186
aVAnd I described to them some of these Lego experiments,
p187
aVand they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment.
p188
aVAnd I asked them, I said,
p189
aV"How many of you now show up to work later than you used to?"
p190
aVAnd everybody raised their hand.
p191
aVI said, "How many of you now go home earlier than you used to?"
p192
aVEverybody raised their hand.
p193
aVI asked them, "How many of you now add
p194
aVnot-so-kosher things to your expense reports?"
p195
aVAnd they didn't raise their hands,
p196
aVbut they took me out to dinner
p197
aVand showed me what they could do with expense reports.
p198
aVAnd then I asked them, I said,
p199
aV"What could the CEO have done to make you not as depressed?"
p200
aVAnd they came up with all kinds of ideas.
p201
aa(lp202
VThey said the CEO could have asked them to present to the whole company
p203
aVabout their journey over the last two years
p204
aVand what they decided to do.
p205
aVHe could have asked them to think about which aspect of their technology
p206
aVcould fit with other parts of the organization.
p207
aVHe could have asked them to build some next-generation prototypes,
p208
aVand see how they would work.
p209
aVBut the thing is that any one of those would require some effort and motivation.
p210
aVAnd I think the CEO basically did not understand the importance of meaning.
p211
aVIf the CEO, just like our participants,
p212
aVthought the essence of meaning is unimportant,
p213
aVthen he [wouldn't] care.
p214
aVAnd he would say, "At the moment I directed you in this way,
p215
aVand now that I'm directing you in this way,
p216
aVeverything will be okay."
p217
aVBut if you understood how important meaning is,
p218
aVthen you would figure out that it's actually important
p219
aVto spend some time, energy and effort
p220
aVin getting people to care more about what they're doing.
p221
aa(lp222
VThe next experiment was slightly different.
p223
aVWe took a sheet of paper with random letters,
p224
aVand we asked people to find pairs of letters
p225
aVthat were identical next to each other.
p226
aVThat was the task.
p227
aVPeople did the first sheet,
p228
aVthen we asked if they wanted to do another for a little less money,
p229
aVthe next sheet for a little bit less, and so on and so forth.
p230
aVAnd we had three conditions.
p231
aVIn the first condition, people wrote their name on the sheet,
p232
aVfound all the pairs of letters,
p233
aVgave it to the experimenter,
p234
aVthe experimenter would look at it,
p235
aVscan it from top to bottom,
p236
aVsay "Uh huh," and put it on the pile next to them.
p237
aVIn the second condition, people did not write their name on it.
p238
aVThe experimenter looked at it,
p239
aVtook the sheet of paper, did not look at it, did not scan it,
p240
aVand simply put it on the pile of pages.
p241
aVSo you take a piece, you just put it on the side.
p242
aVIn the third condition,
p243
aVthe experimenter got the sheet of paper,
p244
aVand put it directly into a shredder.
p245
aa(lp246
V(Laughter)
p247
aa(lp248
VWhat happened in those three conditions?
p249
aa(lp250
VIn this plot I'm showing you at what pay rate people stopped.
p251
aVSo low numbers mean that people worked harder.
p252
aVThey worked for much longer.
p253
aVIn the acknowledged condition,
p254
aVpeople worked all the way down to 15 cents.
p255
aVAt 15 cents per page,
p256
aVthey basically stopped these efforts.
p257
aVIn the shredder condition, it was twice as much \u2014 30 cents per sheet.
p258
aa(lp259
VAnd this is basically the result we had before.
p260
aVYou shred people's efforts, output \u2014
p261
aVyou get them not to be as happy with what they're doing.
p262
aVBut I should point out, by the way,
p263
aVthat in the shredder condition, people could have cheated.
p264
aVThey could have done not so good work,
p265
aVbecause they realized people were just shredding it.
p266
aVSo maybe the first sheet you'd do good work,
p267
aVbut then you see nobody is really testing it,
p268
aVso you would do more and more and more.
p269
aVSo in fact, in the shredder condition,
p270
aVpeople could have submitted more work and gotten more money,
p271
aVand put less effort into it.
p272
aVBut what about the ignored condition?
p273
aVWould the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged
p274
aVor more like the shredder, or somewhere in the middle?
p275
aVIt turns out it was almost like the shredder.
p276
aa(lp277
VNow there's good news and bad news here.
p278
aVThe bad news is that ignoring the performance of people
p279
aVis almost as bad as shredding their effort in front of their eyes.
p280
aVIgnoring gets you a whole way out there.
p281
aVThe good news is that by simply looking at something that somebody has done,
p282
aVscanning it and saying "Uh huh,"
p283
aVthat seems to be quite sufficient
p284
aVto dramatically improve people's motivations.
p285
aVSo the good news is that adding motivation
p286
aVdoesn't seem to be so difficult.
p287
aVThe bad news is that eliminating motivations
p288
aVseems to be incredibly easy,
p289
aVand if we don't think about it carefully, we might overdo it.
p290
aVSo this is all in terms of negative motivation,
p291
aVor eliminating negative motivation.
p292
aa(lp293
VThe next part I want to show you is something about positive motivation.
p294
aVSo there is a store in the U.S. called IKEA.
p295
aVAnd IKEA is a store with kind of okay furniture
p296
aVthat takes a long time to assemble.
p297
aa(lp298
V(Laughter)
p299
aa(lp300
VI don't know about you,
p301
aVbut every time I assemble one of those,
p302
aVit takes me much longer, it's much more effortful,
p303
aVit's much more confusing, I put things in the wrong way \u2014
p304
aVI can't say I enjoy those pieces.
p305
aVI can't say I enjoy the process.
p306
aVBut when I finish it,
p307
aVI seem to like those IKEA pieces of furniture
p308
aVmore than I like other ones.
p309
aa(lp310
V(Laughter)
p311
aa(lp312
VAnd there's an old story about cake mixes.
p313
aVSo when they started cake mixes in the '40s,
p314
aVthey would take this powder and they would put it in a box,
p315
aVand they would ask housewives to basically pour it in,
p316
aVstir some water in it,
p317
aVmix it, put it in the oven, and \u2014 voila \u2014 you had cake.
p318
aVBut it turns out they were very unpopular.
p319
aVPeople did not want them,
p320
aVand they thought about all kinds of reasons for that.
p321
aVMaybe the taste was not good?
p322
aVNo, the taste was great.
p323
aVWhat they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved.
p324
aVIt was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests
p325
aVand say, "Here is my cake."
p326
aVNo, it was somebody else's cake, as if you bought it in the store.
p327
aVIt didn't really feel like your own.
p328
aVSo what did they do?
p329
aVThey took the eggs and the milk out of the powder.
p330
aa(lp331
V(Laughter)
p332
aa(lp333
VNow you had to break the eggs and add them,
p334
aVyou had to measure the milk and add it, mixing it.
p335
aVNow it was your cake. Now everything was fine.
p336
aa(lp337
V(Laughter)
p338
aa(lp339
V(Applause)
p340
aa(lp341
VNow, I think a little bit like the IKEA effect,
p342
aVby getting people to work harder,
p343
aVthey actually got them to love what they're doing
p344
aVto a higher degree.
p345
aa(lp346
VSo how do we look at this question experimentally?
p347
aVWe asked people to build some origami.
p348
aVWe gave them instructions on how to create origami,
p349
aVand we gave them a sheet of paper.
p350
aVAnd these were all novices,
p351
aVand they built something that was really quite ugly \u2014
p352
aVnothing like a frog or a crane.
p353
aVBut then we told them, "Look, this origami really belongs to us.
p354
aVYou worked for us, but I'll tell you what, we'll sell it to you.
p355
aVHow much do you want to pay for it?"
p356
aVAnd we measured how much they were willing to pay for it.
p357
aVAnd we had two types of people:
p358
aVWe had the people who built it,
p359
aVand the people who did not build it,
p360
aVand just looked at it as external observers.
p361
aVAnd what we found was that the builders thought
p362
aVthat these were beautiful pieces of origami \u2014
p363
aa(lp364
V(Laughter)
p365
aa(lp366
Vand they were willing to pay five times more for them
p367
aVthan the people who just evaluated them externally.
p368
aVNow you could say \u2014 if you were a builder,
p369
aVdo you think [you'd say], "Oh, I love this origami,
p370
aVbut I know that nobody else would love it?"
p371
aVOr "I love this origami, and everybody else will love it as well?"
p372
aVWhich one of those two is correct?
p373
aVTurns out the builders not only loved the origami more,
p374
aVthey thought that everybody would see the world in their view.
p375
aVThey thought everybody else would love it more as well.
p376
aa(lp377
VIn the next version, we tried to do the IKEA effect.
p378
aVWe tried to make it more difficult.
p379
aVSo for some people, we gave the same task.
p380
aVFor some people, we made it harder by hiding the instructions.
p381
aVAt the top of the sheet, we had little diagrams
p382
aVof how you fold origami.
p383
aVFor some people, we just eliminated that.
p384
aVSo now this was tougher.
p385
aVWhat happened?
p386
aVWell in an objective way,
p387
aVthe origami now was uglier, it was more difficult.
p388
aVNow when we looked at the easy origami, we saw the same thing \u2014
p389
aVbuilders loved it more, evaluators loved it less.
p390
aVWhen you looked at the hard instructions,
p391
aVthe effect was larger.
p392
aVWhy?
p393
aVBecause now the builders loved it even more.
p394
aa(lp395
V(Laughter)
p396
aa(lp397
VThey put all this extra effort into it.
p398
aVAnd evaluators?
p399
aVThey loved it even less.
p400
aVBecause in reality, it was even uglier than the first version.
p401
aa(lp402
V(Laughter)
p403
aa(lp404
VOf course, this tells you something about how we evaluate things.
p405
aa(lp406
VNow think about kids.
p407
aVImagine I asked you, "How much would you sell your kids for?"
p408
aVYour memories and associations and so on.
p409
aVMost people would say for a lot, a lot of money.
p410
aa(lp411
V(Laughter)
p412
aa(lp413
VOn good days.
p414
aa(lp415
V(Laughter)
p416
aa(lp417
VBut imagine this was slightly different.
p418
aVImagine if you did not have your kids.
p419
aVAnd one day you went to the park and you met some kids.
p420
aVThey were just like your kids,
p421
aVand you played with them for a few hours,
p422
aVand when you were about to leave, the parents said, "Hey, by the way,
p423
aVjust before you leave, if you're interested, they're for sale."
p424
aa(lp425
V(Laughter)
p426
aa(lp427
VHow much would you pay for them now?
p428
aVMost people say not that much.
p429
aVAnd this is because our kids are so valuable,
p430
aVnot just because of who they are,
p431
aVbut because of us,
p432
aVbecause they are so connected to us,
p433
aVand because of the time and connection.
p434
aVBy the way, if you think IKEA instructions are not good,
p435
aVwhat about the instructions that come with kids, those are really tough.
p436
aa(lp437
V(Laughter)
p438
aa(lp439
VBy the way, these are my kids, which, of course, are wonderful and so on.
p440
aVWhich comes to tell you one more thing,
p441
aVwhich is, much like our builders,
p442
aVwhen they look at the creature of their creation,
p443
aVwe don't see that other people don't see things our way.
p444
aa(lp445
VLet me say one last comment.
p446
aVIf you think about Adam Smith versus Karl Marx,
p447
aVAdam Smith had a very important notion of efficiency.
p448
aVHe gave an example of a pin factory.
p449
aVHe said pins have 12 different steps,
p450
aVand if one person does all 12 steps, production is very low.
p451
aVBut if you get one person to do step one,
p452
aVand one person to do step two and step three and so on,
p453
aVproduction can increase tremendously.
p454
aVAnd indeed, this is a great example,
p455
aVand the reason for the Industrial Revolution and efficiency.
p456
aVKarl Marx, on the other hand,
p457
aVsaid that the alienation of labor is incredibly important
p458
aVin how people think about the connection to what they are doing.
p459
aVAnd if you do all 12 steps, you care about the pin.
p460
aVBut if you do one step every time, maybe you don't care as much.
p461

VI think that in the Industrial Revolution,
p463
aVAdam Smith was more correct than Karl Marx.
p464
aVBut the reality is that we've switched,
p465
aVand now we're in the knowledge economy.
p466
aVYou can ask yourself, what happens in a knowledge economy?
p467
aVIs efficiency still more important than meaning?
p468
aVI think the answer is no.
p469
aVI think that as we move to situations
p470
aVin which people have to decide on their own
p471
aVabout how much effort, attention, caring, how connected they feel to it,
p472
aVare they thinking about labor on the way to work,
p473
aVand in the shower and so on,
p474
aVall of a sudden Marx has more things to say to us.
p475
aVSo when we think about labor,
p476
aVwe usually think about motivation and payment as the same thing,
p477
aVbut the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it \u2014
p478
aVmeaning, creation, challenges, ownership, identity, pride, etc.
p479
aa(lp480
VThe good news is that if we added all of those components
p481
aVand thought about them \u2014
p482
aVhow do we create our own meaning, pride, motivation,
p483
aVand how do we do it in our workplace,
p484
aVand for the employees \u2014
p485
aVI think we could get people to be both more productive and happier.
