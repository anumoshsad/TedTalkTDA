VI opened a blind man's head.
p4
aVI didn't make him think or reflect \u2014 I cracked his head open, literally.
p5
aVWe were walking with him holding onto my shoulder,
p6
aVI miscalculated how much space there was between us,
p7
aVand I knocked him into a gate.
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VFive stitches in his forehead.
p12
aVAt that moment, I felt like the worst teacher in the world.
p13
aVI really didn't know how to apologize.
p14
aVLuckily, El Pulga is one of those people who takes things quite well.
p15
aVAnd to this day, he says that I was the coach
p16
aVwho left the most important mark on his career.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VThe truth is, when I started working at the institute for the blind,
p21
aVI was surprised by a lot of things.
p22
aVA lot of the things they did, I never imagined they could:
p23
aVthey swam, did exercise, played cards.
p24
aVThey drank mate, and could pour it
p25
aVwithout burning themselves in the process.
p26
aa(lp27
VBut when I saw them playing soccer \u2014
p28
aVthat was amazing.
p29
aVThey had a dirt field, rusty goalposts and broken nets.
p30
aVThe blind who attended the institute would play their games there,
p31
aVjust like I did at a field near my house.
p32
aVBut they played without being able to see.
p33
aVThe ball made a sound so they could locate it.
p34
aVThey had a guide behind the rival team's goal
p35
aVto know where to kick the ball.
p36
aVAnd they used eye masks.
p37
aVThere were guys who could still see a little,
p38
aVand they wore eye masks so everyone was equal.
p39
aa(lp40
VWhen I was more at ease with them, I asked for a mask myself.
p41
aVI put it on and tried to play.
p42
aVI had played soccer all my life.
p43
aVThis is where it got even more amazing:
p44
aVwithin two seconds, I didn't know where I was standing.
p45
aVI had studied physical education because I loved high performance.
p46
aa(lp47
VI started working at the institute by chance.
p48
aVMy other job was with the Argentinian National Rowing Team,
p49
aVand I felt that was my thing.
p50
aVHere, everything was twice as hard.
p51
aVI'll never forget the first day I did the warm-up with the team.
p52
aVI lined them up in front of me \u2014
p53
aVI used to do that with the rowing team \u2014
p54
aVand I said, "OK, everyone bend down," going like this.
p55
aVWhen I looked up, two guys were seated,
p56
aVthree were lying down and others were squatting.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VHow could I do here the same things I was doing there?
p61
aVIt took me a while.
p62
aVI started looking for tools to learn from them,
p63
aVfrom the teachers who worked with them.
p64
aVI learned I couldn't explain a play on a chalkboard like a coach does,
p65
aVbut I could use a plastic tray and some bottle caps
p66
aVso they could follow me by way of touch.
p67
aVI also learned they could run on a track
p68
aVif I ran with them, holding a rope.
p69
aVSo we started looking for volunteers to help us run with them.
p70
aa(lp71
VI was enjoying it,
p72
aVand finding purpose and meaning in what we were doing.
p73
aVIt was hard at first, it was uncomfortable,
p74
aVbut I decided to overcome the discomfort.
p75
aVAnd there came a time
p76
aVwhen it became the most fascinating job I'd ever had.
p77
aa(lp78
VI think that's when I wondered:
p79
aVWhy couldn't we be a high-performance team as well?
p80
aVOf course, one thing was missing:
p81
aVI needed to find out what they wanted,
p82
aVthe real protagonists of this story.
p83
aVThree hours of training, playing soccer on that field,
p84
aVwere not going to be enough.
p85
aVWe would have to train differently.
p86
aa(lp87
VWe started to train harder, and the results were great;
p88
aVthey asked for more.
p89
aVI came to understand that they, too, wondered
p90
aVwhy they couldn't do high-performance.
p91
aVWhen we felt ready, we knocked at CENARD's door.
p92
aVCENARD is the National Center for High-Performance Sports
p93
aVhere in Argentina.
p94
aVIt was hard to get them to hear what we had to say.
p95
aVBut it was considerably more difficult
p96
aVto get the other athletes training there to consider us their equals.
p97
aVIn fact, they would let us use the field
p98
aVonly when no other teams were using it.
p99
aVAnd we were known as "the blind ones."
p100
aVNot everyone knew exactly what we were doing there.
p101
aa(lp102
VThe 2006 World Championship was a turning point in the team's history.
p103
aVIt was held in Buenos Aires for the first time.
p104
aVIt was our chance to show everyone
p105
aVwhat we had been doing all that time.
p106
aVWe made it to the finals.
p107
aVWe were growing as a team.
p108
aa(lp109
VIt was us against Brazil in the finals.
p110
aVThey were the best team in the tournament.
p111
aVThey won every game by a landslide.
p112
aVHardly anyone believed we could win that game.
p113
aVHardly anyone \u2014 except for us.
p114
aa(lp115
VDuring pre-game meetings,
p116
aVin the locker room,
p117
aVduring each warm-up,
p118
aVit smelled of victory.
p119
aVI swear that smell exists.
p120
aVI smelled it several times with the team,
p121
aVbut I remember it in particular, the day before we played that final.
p122
aVThe Argentine Football Association had opened their doors to us.
p123
aa(lp124
VWe were training at AFA,
p125
aVwhere Verón, Higuain and Messi trained.
p126
aVFor the first time ever,
p127
aVwe felt like a true national team.
p128
aVAt 7:30pm, the day before the game,
p129
aVwe were in the lounge discussing strategy,
p130
aVand a waiter knocks on the door, interrupting our conversation.
p131
aVHe suggested we go to church.
p132
aVHe came to invite us to church.
p133
aVI tried to get rid of him, saying it wasn't a good time,
p134
aVthat we better leave it for another day.
p135
aVHe kept insisting, asking me to please let him take the guys to church,
p136
aVbecause that day, a pastor who performed miracles would be there.
p137
aa(lp138
VI was slightly afraid to ask what type of miracles he meant,
p139
aVand he replied nonchalantly,
p140
aV"Coach, let me take the team to the church,
p141
aVand when we return, I guarantee that half of them will be able to see."
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VSome of the guys laughed,
p146
aVbut imagine being a blind person and someone says that to you.
p147
aVI didn't know what to say.
p148
aVI said nothing; it was an awkward silence.
p149
aVI didn't want to make him feel bad,
p150
aVbecause he truly believed this could happen.
p151
aa(lp152
VOne of the players saved me,
p153
aVwhen he stood up and confidently said,
p154
aV"Juan," \u2014 that was the kid's name \u2014
p155
aVGonza already told you it's not the best time to go to church.
p156
aVBesides, let me make this clear:
p157
aVif we go to that church, and I end up being able to see when we return,
p158
aVI will beat you so hard if I can't play tomorrow."
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
V(Applause)
p163
aa(lp164
VJuan left, laughing in resignation,
p165
aVand we continued with our pregame talk.
p166
aVThat night when I went to sleep,
p167
aVI began to dream about the next day's game,
p168
aVimagining what could happen, how we would play.
p169
aVAnd that's when I noticed that smell of victory
p170
aVI mentioned a while ago.
p171
aVAnd it's because at that moment, I thought:
p172
aVif the other players had the same desire as Diego going into the game,
p173
aVit was impossible for us not to win.
p174
aa(lp175
VThe next day was going to be wonderful.
p176
aVWe got up at 9am, the game was at 7pm,
p177
aVand we were already eager to play.
p178
aVWe left AFA, and the bus was full of flags that people had given to us.
p179
aVWe were talking about the game,
p180
aVand we could hear people honking and cheering,
p181
aV"Go Murciélagos! Today's the day! The final challenge!"
p182
aa(lp183
VThe guys asked me, "Do they know us? Do they know we're playing?"
p184
aVSome people followed the bus to CENARD.
p185
aVWe arrived and found an amazing scene.
p186
aVIn the corridor leading from the locker room to the game field,
p187
aVI was walking with Silvio,
p188
aVwho was holding onto my shoulder, so I could guide him.
p189
aVFortunately, there were no gates along the way.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VWhen we reached the field, he asked me about everything.
p194
aVHe didn't want to miss a single detail.
p195
aVHe said, "Tell me what you see, tell me who's playing the drums."
p196
aa(lp197
VI tried to explain what was happening with as much detail as possible.
p198
aVI told him, "The stands are packed, a lot of people couldn't get in,
p199
aVthere are blue and white balloons all over the field,
p200
aVthey're opening a giant Argentine flag that covers the entire grandstand."
p201
aa(lp202
VSuddenly, he cuts me off and says,
p203
aV"Do you see a flag that says 'San Pedro'?"
p204
aVThat's the city where he lives.
p205
aVI started looking into the stands
p206
aVand I spotted a little white flag
p207
aVwith lettering done in black spray paint, that read:
p208
aV"Silvio, your family and all of San Pedro are here."
p209
aa(lp210
VI told him that and he replied,
p211
aV"That's my mom, tell me where she is, I want to I wave at her."
p212
aVI pointed him toward the flag
p213
aVand showed him with his arm where they were sitting,
p214
aVand he waved his arms in that direction.
p215
aVAbout 20 or 30 people stood up and gave him an ovation.
p216
aVWhen that happened,
p217
aVI saw how his face changed, how moved he was.
p218
aVIt was moving for me, too;
p219
aVtwo seconds later, I had a lump in my throat.
p220
aVIt was strange \u2014 I felt both the excitement of what was happening,
p221
aVand the anger and the anguish that he could not see it.
p222
aa(lp223
VA few days later when I told him what I had experienced,
p224
aVhe tried to reassure me, saying,
p225
aV"Gonza, don't feel bad, I could see them.
p226
aVDifferently, but I swear to you that I saw them all."
p227
aa(lp228
VThe game started.
p229
aVWe could not fail; it was the final.
p230
aVThe audience was quiet, like here,
p231
aVbecause in soccer for the blind,
p232
aVthe public has to be quiet so the players can hear the ball.
p233
aVThey're only allowed to cheer when the game is over.
p234
aa(lp235
VAnd when there were eight minutes to go,
p236
aVthe crowd did all the cheering they hadn't done in the first 32 minutes.
p237
aVWhen pigeon-toed Silvio nailed the ball at an angle,
p238
aVthey cheered with all their heart,
p239
aVin an incredible way.
p240
aa(lp241
VToday, if you go to CENARD, you'll see a huge poster on the door,
p242
aVwith a photo of our team, Los Murciélagos.
p243
aVThey're a model national team, everyone in CENARD knows who they are,
p244
aVand after having won two World Championships
p245
aVand two Paralympic medals,
p246
aVno one doubts they are high-performance athletes.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Applause)
p249
aa(lp250
V(Applause ends)
p251
aa(lp252
VI was lucky to train this team for 10 years,
p253
aVfirst as a trainer and later as their coach.
p254
aVI feel that they've given me much more
p255
aVthan what I've given them.
p256
aa(lp257
VLast year, they asked me to coach another national team, Power Soccer.
p258
aVIt's a national team of young men who play soccer in wheelchairs.
p259
aVThey use motorized wheelchairs that they drive with a joystick,
p260
aVbecause they don't have enough strength in their arms
p261
aVto use conventional chairs.
p262
aVThey added a bumper to the chair, a safeguard that protects their feet,
p263
aVwhile allowing them to kick the ball.
p264
aVIt's the first time that, instead of being the spectators,
p265
aVthey're now the main characters.
p266
aVIt's the first time their parents, friends and siblings can see them play.
p267
aa(lp268
VFor me, it's a new challenge,
p269
aVwith the same discomfort, insecurity, and fear I had
p270
aVwhen I started working with the blind.
p271
aVBut I approach it all from a more experienced position.
p272
aVThat's why from day one, I treat them as athletes on the field,
p273
aVand off the field, I try to put myself in their shoes
p274
aVand behave without prejudice,
p275
aVbecause treating them naturally feels best to them.
p276
aa(lp277
VBoth teams play soccer; something once unthinkable for them.
p278
aVThey had to adapt the rules to do so.
p279
aVAnd both teams broke the same rule \u2014
p280
aVthe one that said they couldn't play soccer.
p281
aa(lp282
VWhen you see them play, you see competition, not disability.
p283
aVThe problem starts when the game is over,
p284
aVand they leave the field.
p285
aVThen they step in to play our game,
p286
aVin a society whose rules don't really take them into account
p287
aVor care for them.
p288
aa(lp289
VI learned from sports
p290
aVthat disability greatly depends on the rules of the game.
p291
aVI believe that if we change some of the rules of our game,
p292
aVwe can make life a little easier for them.
p293
aa(lp294
VWe all know there are people with disabilities; we see them daily.
p295
aVBut by having no direct contact with them,
p296
aVwe're not aware of the problems they face every day,
p297
aVlike how hard it is for them to get on a bus,
p298
aVfind a job,
p299
aVtake the subway
p300
aVor cross the street.
p301
aa(lp302
VIt's true that there is an increasing social responsibility
p303
aVregarding the inclusion of people with disabilities.
p304
aVBut I think it's still not enough.
p305
aVI think change needs to come from every one of us.
p306
aVFirst, by leaving behind our indifference toward the disabled,
p307
aVand then by respecting the rules that do take them into account.
p308
aVThey are few, but they do exist.
p309
aa(lp310
VI cracked a blind man's head open \u2014 El Pulga's head.
p311
aVI can assure you these two teams opened mine as well.
p312
aVThey taught me that above all,
p313
aVyou have to get out there and play every game
p314
aVin this beautiful tournament that we call life.
p315
aa(lp316
VThank you.
