VMy passions
p4
aVare music, technology and making things.
p5
aVAnd it's the combination of these things
p6
aVthat has led me to the hobby of sound visualization,
p7
aVand, on occasion, has led me to play with fire.
p8
aa(lp9
VThis is a Rubens' tube. It's one of many I've made over the years,
p10
aVand I have one here tonight.
p11
aVIt's about an 8-foot-long tube of metal,
p12
aVit's got a hundred or so holes on top,
p13
aVon that side is the speaker, and here
p14
aVis some lab tubing, and it's connected to this tank
p15
aVof propane.
p16
aVSo, let's fire it up and see what it does.
p17
aVSo let's play a 550-herz frequency
p18
aVand watch what happens.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Frequency)
p21
aa(lp22
VThank you. (Applause)
p23
aVIt's okay to applaud the laws of physics,
p24
aVbut essentially what's happening here
p25
aV\u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p26
aVis the energy from the sound via the air and gas molecules
p27
aVis influencing the combustion properties of propane,
p28
aVcreating a visible waveform,
p29
aVand we can see the alternating regions of compression
p30
aVand rarefaction that we call frequency,
p31
aVand the height is showing us amplitude.
p32
aVSo let's change the frequency of the sound,
p33
aVand watch what happens to the fire.
p34
aa(lp35
V(Higher frequency)
p36
aa(lp37
VSo every time we hit a resonant frequency we get a standing wave
p38
aVand that emergent sine curve of fire.
p39
aVSo let's turn that off. We're indoors.
p40
aVThank you. (Applause)
p41
aa(lp42
VI also have with me a flame table.
p43
aVIt's very similar to a Rubens' tube, and it's also used
p44
aVfor visualizing the physical properties of sound,
p45
aVsuch as eigenmodes, so let's fire it up
p46
aVand see what it does.
p47
aa(lp48
VOoh. (Laughter)
p49
aVOkay. Now, while the table comes up to pressure,
p50
aVlet me note here that the sound is not traveling
p51
aVin perfect lines. It's actually traveling in all directions,
p52
aVand the Rubens' tube's a little like bisecting those waves
p53
aVwith a line, and the flame table's a little like
p54
aVbisecting those waves with a plane,
p55
aVand it can show a little more subtle complexity, which is why
p56
aVI like to use it to watch Geoff Farina play guitar.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Music)
p59
aa(lp60
VAll right, so it's a delicate dance.
p61
aVIf you watch closely \u2014 (Applause)
p62
aVIf you watch closely, you may have seen
p63
aVsome of the eigenmodes, but also you may have seen
p64
aVthat jazz music is better with fire.
p65
aVActually, a lot of things are better with fire in my world,
p66
aVbut the fire's just a foundation.
p67
aVIt shows very well that eyes can hear,
p68
aVand this is interesting to me because
p69
aVtechnology allows us to present sound to the eyes
p70
aVin ways that accentuate the strength of the eyes
p71
aVfor seeing sound, such as the removal of time.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo here, I'm using a rendering algorithm to paint
p74
aVthe frequencies of the song "Smells Like Teen Spirit"
p75
aVin a way that the eyes can take them in
p76
aVas a single visual impression, and the technique
p77
aVwill also show the strengths of the visual cortex
p78
aVfor pattern recognition.
p79
aVSo if I show you another song off this album,
p80
aVand another, your eyes will easily pick out
p81
aVthe use of repetition by the band Nirvana,
p82
aVand in the frequency distribution, the colors,
p83
aVyou can see the clean-dirty-clean sound
p84
aVthat they are famous for,
p85
aVand here is the entire album as a single visual impression,
p86
aVand I think this impression is pretty powerful.
p87
aa(lp88
VAt least, it's powerful enough that
p89
aVif I show you these four songs,
p90
aVand I remind you that this is "Smells Like Teen Spirit,"
p91
aVyou can probably correctly guess, without listening
p92
aVto any music at all, that the song
p93
aVa die hard Nirvana fan would enjoy is this song,
p94
aV"I'll Stick Around" by the Foo Fighters,
p95
aVwhose lead singer is Dave Grohl,
p96
aVwho was the drummer in Nirvana.
p97
aVThe songs are a little similar, but mostly
p98
aVI'm just interested in the idea that someday maybe
p99
aVwe'll buy a song because we like the way it looks.
p100
aa(lp101
VAll right, now for some more sound data.
p102
aVThis is data from a skate park,
p103
aVand this is Mabel Davis skate park
p104
aVin Austin, Texas. (Skateboard sounds)
p105
aVAnd the sounds you're hearing came from eight
p106
aVmicrophones attached to obstacles around the park,
p107
aVand it sounds like chaos, but actually
p108
aVall the tricks start with a very distinct slap,
p109
aVbut successful tricks end with a pop,
p110
aVwhereas unsuccessful tricks
p111
aVmore of a scratch and a tumble,
p112
aVand tricks on the rail will ring out like a gong, and
p113
aVvoices occupy very unique frequencies in the skate park.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo if we were to render these sounds visually,
p116
aVwe might end up with something like this.
p117
aVThis is all 40 minutes of the recording,
p118
aVand right away the algorithm tells us
p119
aVa lot more tricks are missed than are made,
p120
aVand also a trick on the rails is a lot more likely
p121
aVto produce a cheer, and if you look really closely,
p122
aVwe can tease out traffic patterns.
p123
aVYou see the skaters often trick in this direction. The obstacles are easier.
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd in the middle of the recording, the mics pick this up,
p126
aVbut later in the recording, this kid shows up,
p127
aVand he starts using a line at the top of the park
p128
aVto do some very advanced tricks on something
p129
aVcalled the tall rail.
p130
aVAnd it's fascinating. At this moment in time,
p131
aVall the rest of the skaters turn their lines 90 degrees
p132
aVto stay out of his way.
p133
aVYou see, there's a subtle etiquette in the skate park,
p134
aVand it's led by key influencers,
p135
aVand they tend to be the kids who can do the best tricks,
p136
aVor wear red pants, and on this day the mics picked that up.
p137
aa(lp138
VAll right, from skate physics to theoretical physics.
p139
aVI'm a big fan of Stephen Hawking,
p140
aVand I wanted to use all eight hours
p141
aVof his Cambridge lecture series to create an homage.
p142
aVNow, in this series he's speaking with the aid of a computer,
p143
aVwhich actually makes identifying the ends of sentences
p144
aVfairly easy. So I wrote a steering algorithm.
p145
aVIt listens to the lecture, and then it uses
p146
aVthe amplitude of each word to move a point on the x-axis,
p147
aVand it uses the inflection of sentences
p148
aVto move a same point up and down on the y-axis.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd these trend lines, you can see, there's more questions
p151
aVthan answers in the laws of physics,
p152
aVand when we reach the end of a sentence,
p153
aVwe place a star at that location.
p154
aVSo there's a lot of sentences, so a lot of stars,
p155
aVand after rendering all of the audio, this is what we get.
p156
aVThis is Stephen Hawking's universe.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Applause)
p159
aa(lp160
VIt's all eight hours of the Cambridge lecture series
p161
aVtaken in as a single visual impression,
p162
aVand I really like this image,
p163
aVbut a lot of people think it's fake.
p164
aVSo I made a more interactive version,
p165
aVand the way I did that is I used their position in time
p166
aVin the lecture to place these stars into 3D space,
p167
aVand with some custom software and a Kinect,
p168
aVI can walk right into the lecture.
p169
aVI'm going to wave through the Kinect here
p170
aVand take control, and now I'm going to reach out
p171
aVand I'm going to touch a star, and when I do,
p172
aVit will play the sentence
p173
aVthat generated that star.
p174
aa(lp175
VStephen Hawking: There is one, and only one, arrangement
p176
aVin which the pieces make a complete picture.
p177
aa(lp178
VJared Ficklin: Thank you. (Applause)
p179
aVThere are 1,400 stars.
p180
aVIt's a really fun way to explore the lecture,
p181
aVand, I hope, a fitting homage.
p182
aa(lp183
VAll right. Let me close with a work in progress.
p184
aVI think, after 30 years, the opportunity exists
p185
aVto create an enhanced version of closed captioning.
p186
aVNow, we've all seen a lot of TEDTalks online,
p187
aVso let's watch one now with the sound turned off
p188
aVand the closed captioning turned on.
p189
aa(lp190
VThere's no closed captioning for the TED theme song,
p191
aVand we're missing it, but if you've watched enough of these,
p192
aVyou hear it in your mind's ear,
p193
aVand then applause starts.
p194
aVIt usually begins here, and it grows and then it falls.
p195
aVSometimes you get a little star applause,
p196
aVand then I think even Bill Gates takes a nervous breath,
p197
aVand the talk begins.
p198
aa(lp199
VAll right, so let's watch this clip again.
p200
aVThis time, I'm not going to talk at all.
p201
aVThere's still going to be no audio,
p202
aVbut what I am going to do is I'm going to render the sound
p203
aVvisually in real time at the bottom of the screen.
p204
aVSo watch closely and see what your eyes can hear.
p205
aa(lp206
VThis is fairly amazing to me.
p207
aVEven on the first view, your eyes will successfully
p208
aVpick out patterns, but on repeated views,
p209
aVyour brain actually gets better
p210
aVat turning these patterns into information.
p211
aVYou can get the tone and the timbre
p212
aVand the pace of the speech,
p213
aVthings that you can't get out of closed captioning.
p214
aVThat famous scene in horror movies
p215
aVwhere someone is walking up from behind
p216
aVis something you can see,
p217
aVand I believe this information would be something
p218
aVthat is useful at times when the audio is turned off
p219
aVor not heard at all, and I speculate that deaf audiences
p220
aVmight actually even be better
p221
aVat seeing sound than hearing audiences.
p222
aVI don't know. It's a theory right now.
p223
aVActually, it's all just an idea.
p224
aa(lp225
VAnd let me end by saying that sound moves in all directions,
p226
aVand so do ideas.
p227
aVThank you. (Applause)
