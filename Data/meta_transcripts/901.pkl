VWhy grow homes? Because we can.
p4
aVRight now, America is in an unremitting state of trauma.
p5
aVAnd there's a cause for that, all right.
p6
aVWe've got McPeople, McCars, McHouses.
p7
aVAs an architect, I have to confront something like this.
p8
aa(lp9
VSo what's a technology that will allow us
p10
aVto make ginormous houses?
p11
aVWell, it's been around for 2,500 years.
p12
aVIt's called pleaching, or grafting trees together,
p13
aVor grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous, vascular system.
p14
aVAnd we do something different
p15
aVthan what we did in the past;
p16
aVwe add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that.
p17
aVWe use CNC to make scaffolding
p18
aVto train semi-epithetic matter, plants,
p19
aVinto a specific geometry
p20
aVthat makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab.
p21
aVIt fits into the environment. It is the environment.
p22
aVIt is the landscape, right?
p23
aa(lp24
VAnd you can have a hundred million of these homes,
p25
aVand it's great because they suck carbon.
p26
aVThey're perfect.
p27
aVYou can have 100 million families, or take things out of the suburbs,
p28
aVbecause these are homes that are a part of the environment.
p29
aVImagine pre-growing a village \u2014
p30
aVit takes about seven to 10 years \u2014
p31
aVand everything is green.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo not only do we do the veggie house,
p34
aVwe also do the in-vitro meat habitat,
p35
aVor homes that we're doing research on now in Brooklyn,
p36
aVwhere, as an architecture office, we're for the first of its kind
p37
aVto put in a molecular cell biology lab
p38
aVand start experimenting with regenerative medicine
p39
aVand tissue engineering
p40
aVand start thinking about what the future would be
p41
aVif architecture and biology became one.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo we've been doing this for a couple of years, and that's our lab.
p44
aVAnd what we do is we grow
p45
aVextracellular matrix from pigs.
p46
aVWe use a modified inkjet printer,
p47
aVand we print geometry.
p48
aVWe print geometry where we can make industrial design objects
p49
aVlike, you know, shoes, leather belts,
p50
aVhandbags, etc.,
p51
aVwhere no sentient creature is harmed.
p52
aVIt's victimless. It's meat from a test tube.
p53
aVSo our theory is that eventually
p54
aVwe should be doing this with homes.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo here is a typical stud wall,
p57
aVan architectural construction,
p58
aVand this is a section
p59
aVof our proposal for a meat house,
p60
aVwhere you can see we use fatty cells as insulation,
p61
aVcilia for dealing with wind loads
p62
aVand sphincter muscles for the doors and windows.
p63
aa(lp64
V(Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd we know it's incredibly ugly.
p67
aVIt could have been an English Tudor or Spanish Colonial,
p68
aVbut we kind of chose this shape.
p69
aVAnd there it is kind of grown, at least one particular section of it.
p70
aa(lp71
VWe had a big show in Prague,
p72
aVand we decided to put it in front of the cathedral
p73
aVso religion can confront the house of meat.
p74
aVThat's why we grow homes. Thanks very much.
