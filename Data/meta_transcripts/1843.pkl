VSo I'm a city planner, an urban designer,
p4
aVformer arts advocate,
p5
aVtrained in architecture and art history,
p6
aVand I want to talk to you today not about design
p7
aVbut about America
p8
aVand how America can be more economically resilient,
p9
aVhow America can be healthier,
p10
aVand how America can be
p11
aVmore environmentally sustainable.
p12
aVAnd I realize this is a global forum,
p13
aVbut I think I need to talk about America
p14
aVbecause there is a history,
p15
aVin some places, not all,
p16
aVof American ideas being appropriated,
p17
aVbeing emulated, for better or for worse,
p18
aVaround the world.
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd the worst idea we've ever had
p21
aVis suburban sprawl.
p22
aVIt's being emulated in many places as we speak.
p23
aVBy suburban sprawl, I refer to the reorganization
p24
aVof the landscape and the creation of the landscape
p25
aVaround the requirement of automobile use,
p26
aVand that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom
p27
aVhas become a gas-belching,
p28
aVtime-wasting and life-threatening
p29
aVprosthetic device
p30
aVthat many of us need just to,
p31
aVmost Americans, in fact, need,
p32
aVjust to live their daily lives.
p33
aVAnd there's an alternative.
p34
aVYou know, we say, half the world is living in cities.
p35
aVWell, in America, that living in cities,
p36
aVfor many of them, they're living in cities still
p37
aVwhere they're dependent on that automobile.
p38
aVAnd what I work for, and to do,
p39
aVis to make our cities more walkable.
p40
aVBut I can't give design arguments for that
p41
aVthat will have as much impact
p42
aVas the arguments that I've learned
p43
aVfrom the economists, the epidemiologists
p44
aVand the environmentalists.
p45
aVSo these are the three arguments that I'm going
p46
aVto give you quickly today.
p47
aa(lp48
VWhen I was growing up in the '70s,
p49
aVthe typical American spent one tenth of their income,
p50
aVAmerican family, on transportation.
p51
aVSince then, we've doubled the number of roads
p52
aVin America, and we now spend one fifth
p53
aVof our income on transportation.
p54
aVWorking families, which are defined as
p55
aVearning between 20,000 and 50,000 dollars
p56
aVa year in America
p57
aVare spending more now on transportation
p58
aVthan on housing, slightly more,
p59
aVbecause of this phenomenon called "drive till you qualify,"
p60
aVfinding homes further and further and further
p61
aVfrom the city centers and from their jobs,
p62
aVso that they're locked in this, two, three hours,
p63
aVfour hours a day of commuting.
p64
aVAnd these are the neighborhoods, for example,
p65
aVin the Central Valley of California
p66
aVthat weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst
p67
aVand when the price of gas went up;
p68
aVthey were decimated.
p69
aVAnd in fact, these are many
p70
aVof the half-vacant communities that you see today.
p71
aVImagine putting everything you have into your mortgage,
p72
aVit goes underwater, and you have to pay
p73
aVtwice as much for all the driving that you're doing.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo we know what it's done to our society
p76
aVand all the extra work we have to do
p77
aVto support our cars.
p78
aVWhat happens when a city decides
p79
aVit's going to set other priorities?
p80
aVAnd probably the best example we have here
p81
aVin America is Portland, Oregon.
p82
aVPortland made a bunch of decisions in the 1970s
p83
aVthat began to distinguish it
p84
aVfrom almost every other American city.
p85
aVWhile most other cities were growing
p86
aVan undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl,
p87
aVthey instituted an urban growth boundary.
p88
aVWhile most cities were reaming out their roads,
p89
aVremoving parallel parking and trees
p90
aVin order to flow more traffic,
p91
aVthey instituted a skinny streets program.
p92
aVAnd while most cities were investing in more roads
p93
aVand more highways, they actually invested
p94
aVin bicycling and in walking.
p95
aVAnd they spent 60 million dollars on bike facilities,
p96
aVwhich seems like a lot of money,
p97
aVbut it was spent over about 30 years,
p98
aVso two million dollars a year \u2014 not that much \u2014
p99
aVand half the price of the one cloverleaf
p100
aVthat they decided to rebuild in that city.
p101
aVThese changes and others like them changed
p102
aVthe way that Portlanders live,
p103
aVand their vehicle-miles traveled per day,
p104
aVthe amount that each person drives,
p105
aVactually peaked in 1996,
p106
aVhas been dropping ever since,
p107
aVand they now drive 20 percent less
p108
aVthan the rest of the country.
p109
aVThe typical Portland citizen drives
p110
aVfour miles less, and 11 minutes less per day
p111
aVthan they did before.
p112
aVThe economist Joe Cortright did the math
p113
aVand he found out that those four miles
p114
aVplus those 11 minutes
p115
aVadds up to fully three and a half percent
p116
aVof all income earned in the region.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo if they're not spending that money on driving \u2014
p119
aVand by the way, 85 percent of the money
p120
aVwe spend on driving leaves the local economy \u2014
p121
aVif they're not spending that money on driving,
p122
aVwhat are they spending it on?
p123
aVWell, Portland is reputed to have
p124
aVthe most roof racks per capita,
p125
aVthe most independent bookstores per capita,
p126
aVthe most strip clubs per capita.
p127
aVThese are all exaggerations, slight exaggerations
p128
aVof a fundamental truth, which is Portlanders
p129
aVspend a lot more on recreation of all kinds
p130
aVthan the rest of America.
p131
aVActually, Oregonians spend more on alcohol
p132
aVthan most other states,
p133
aVwhich may be a good thing or a bad thing,
p134
aVbut it makes you glad they're driving less.
p135
aa(lp136
V(Laughter)
p137
aa(lp138
VBut actually, they're spending most of it in their homes,
p139
aVand home investment is about as local
p140
aVan investment as you can get.
p141
aVBut there's a whole other Portland story,
p142
aVwhich isn't part of this calculus,
p143
aVwhich is that young, educated people
p144
aVhave been moving to Portland in droves,
p145
aVso that between the last two censuses,
p146
aVthey had a 50-percent increase
p147
aVin college-educated millennials,
p148
aVwhich is five times what you saw anywhere else
p149
aVin the country, or, I should say, of the national average.
p150
aa(lp151
VSo on the one hand, a city saves money for its residents
p152
aVby being more walkable and more bikeable,
p153
aVbut on the other hand, it also is the cool kind of city
p154
aVthat people want to be in these days.
p155
aVSo the best economic strategy
p156
aVyou can have as a city
p157
aVis not the old way of trying to attract corporations
p158
aVand trying to have a biotech cluster
p159
aVor a medical cluster,
p160
aVor an aerospace cluster,
p161
aVbut to become a place where people want to be.
p162
aVAnd millennials, certainly, these engines of entrepreneurship,
p163
aV64 percent of whom decide first
p164
aVwhere they want to live,
p165
aVthen they move there, then they look for a job,
p166
aVthey will come to your city.
p167
aa(lp168
VThe health argument is a scary one,
p169
aVand you've probably heard part of this argument before.
p170
aVAgain, back in the '70s, a lot's changed since then,
p171
aVback in the '70s, one in 10 Americans was obese.
p172
aVNow one out of three Americans is obese,
p173
aVand a second third of the population is overweight.
p174
aVTwenty-five percent of young men
p175
aVand 40 percent of young women are too heavy
p176
aVto enlist in our own military forces.
p177
aVAccording to the Center for Disease Control,
p178
aVfully one third of all children born after 2000
p179
aVwill get diabetes.
p180
aVWe have the first generation of children in America
p181
aVwho are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents.
p182
aa(lp183
VI believe that this American healthcare crisis
p184
aVthat we've all heard about
p185
aVis an urban design crisis,
p186
aVand that the design of our cities lies at the cure.
p187
aVBecause we've talked a long time about diet,
p188
aVand we know that diet impacts weight,
p189
aVand weight of course impacts health.
p190
aVBut we've only started talking about inactivity,
p191
aVand how inactivity born of our landscape,
p192
aVinactivity that comes from the fact that we live
p193
aVin a place where there is no longer any such thing
p194
aVas a useful walk, is driving our weight up.
p195
aVAnd we finally have the studies,
p196
aVone in Britain called "Gluttony versus sloth"
p197
aVthat tracked weight against diet
p198
aVand tracked weight against inactivity,
p199
aVand found a much higher, stronger correlation
p200
aVbetween the latter two.
p201
aVDr. James Levine at, in this case,
p202
aVthe aptly-named Mayo Clinic
p203
aVput his test subjects in electronic underwear,
p204
aVheld their diet steady,
p205
aVand then started pumping the calories in.
p206
aVSome people gained weight,
p207
aVsome people didn't gain weight.
p208
aVExpecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work,
p209
aVthey were shocked to learn that the only difference
p210
aVbetween the subjects that they could figure out
p211
aVwas the amount they were moving,
p212
aVand that in fact those who gained weight
p213
aVwere sitting, on average, two hours more per day
p214
aVthan those who didn't.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo we have these studies that tie
p217
aVweight to inactivity, but even more,
p218
aVwe now have studies that tie weight to where you live.
p219
aVDo you live in a more walkable city
p220
aVor do you live in a less walkable city,
p221
aVor where in your city do you live?
p222
aVIn San Diego, they used Walk Score \u2014
p223
aVWalk Score rates every address in America
p224
aVand soon the world
p225
aVin terms of how walkable it is \u2014
p226
aVthey used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods
p227
aVand less walkable neighborhoods.
p228
aVWell guess what? If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood,
p229
aVyou were 35 percent likely to be overweight.
p230
aVIf you lived in a less walkable neighborhood,
p231
aVyou were 60 percent likely to be overweight.
p232
aVSo we have study after study now
p233
aVthat's tying where you live
p234
aVto your health, particularly as in America,
p235
aVthe biggest health crisis we have is this one
p236
aVthat's stemming from environmental-induced inactivity.
p237
aVAnd I learned a new word last week.
p238
aVThey call these neighborhoods "obesageneric."
p239
aVI may have that wrong, but you get the idea.
p240
aa(lp241
VNow that's one thing, of course.
p242
aVBriefly mentioning, we have an asthma epidemic
p243
aVin this country.
p244
aVYou probably haven't thought that much about it.
p245
aVFourteen Americans die each day from asthma,
p246
aVthree times what it was in the '90s,
p247
aVand it's almost all coming from car exhaust.
p248
aVAmerican pollution does not come
p249
aVfrom factories anymore, it comes from tailpipes,
p250
aVand the amount that people are driving in your city,
p251
aVyour urban VMT, is a good prediction
p252
aVof the asthma problems in your city.
p253
aa(lp254
VAnd then finally, in terms of driving,
p255
aVthere's the issue of the single-largest killer
p256
aVof healthy adults, and one of the largest killers
p257
aVof all people, is car crashes.
p258
aVAnd we take car crashes for granted.
p259
aVWe figure it's a natural risk
p260
aVof being on the road.
p261
aVBut in fact, here in America, 12 people
p262
aVout of every 100,000
p263
aVdie every year from car crashes.
p264
aVWe're pretty safe here.
p265
aVWell, guess what? In England, it's seven per 100,000.
p266
aVIt's Japan, it's four per 100,000.
p267
aVDo you know where it's three per 100,000?
p268
aVNew York City.
p269
aVSan Francisco, the same thing. Portland, the same thing.
p270
aVOh, so cities make us safer
p271
aVbecause we're driving less?
p272
aVTulsa: 14 per 100,000.
p273
aVOrlando: 20 per 100,000.
p274
aVIt's not whether you're in the city or not,
p275
aVit's how is your city designed?
p276
aVWas it designed around cars or around people?
p277
aVBecause if your city is designed around cars,
p278
aVit's really good at smashing them into each other.
p279
aa(lp280
VThat's part of a much larger health argument.
p281
aa(lp282
VFinally, the environmental argument is fascinating,
p283
aVbecause the environmentalists turned on a dime
p284
aVabout 10 years ago.
p285
aVThe environmental movement in America
p286
aVhas historically been an anti-city movement
p287
aVfrom Jefferson on.
p288
aa(lp289
V"Cities are pestilential to the health,
p290
aVto the liberties, to the morals of man.
p291
aVIf we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities,
p292
aVas they do in Europe, we shall become as corrupt
p293
aVas they are in Europe
p294
aVand take to eating one another as they do there."
p295
aa(lp296
VHe apparently had a sense of humor.
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd then the American environmental movement
p299
aVhas been a classically Arcadian movement.
p300
aVTo become more environmental, we move into the country,
p301
aVwe commune with nature, we build suburbs.
p302
aVBut, of course, we've seen what that does.
p303
aa(lp304
VThe carbon mapping of America,
p305
aVwhere is the CO2 being emitted,
p306
aVfor many years only
p307
aVhammered this argument in more strongly.
p308
aVIf you look at any carbon map, because we map it per square mile,
p309
aVany carbon map of the U.S.,
p310
aVit looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S.,
p311
aVhottest in the cities, cooler in the suburbs,
p312
aVdark, peaceful in the countryside.
p313
aVUntil some economists said, you know,
p314
aVis that the right way to measure CO2?
p315
aVThere are only so many people in this country at any given time,
p316
aVand we can choose to live where perhaps
p317
aVwe would have a lighter impact.
p318
aVAnd they said, let's measure CO2 per household,
p319
aVand when they did that, the maps just flipped,
p320
aVcoolest in the center city, warmer in the suburbs,
p321
aVand red hot in these exurban
p322
aV"drive till you qualify" neighborhoods.
p323
aVSo a fundamental shift, and now you have
p324
aVenvironmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser
p325
aVsaying we are a destructive species.
p326
aVIf you love nature, the best thing you can do
p327
aVis stay the heck away from it,
p328
aVmove to a city, and the denser the better,
p329
aVand the denser cities like Manhattan
p330
aVare the cities that perform the best.
p331
aVSo the average Manhattanite is consuming gasoline
p332
aVat the rate the rest of the nation hasn't seen since the '20s,
p333
aVconsuming half of the electricity of Dallas.
p334
aVBut of course, we can do better.
p335
aVCanadian cities, they consume half the gasoline of American cities.
p336
aVEuropean cities consume half as much again.
p337
aVSo obviously, we can do better,
p338
aVand we want to do better, and we're all trying to be green.
p339
aa(lp340
VMy final argument in this topic is that
p341
aVI think we're trying to be green the wrong way,
p342
aVand I'm one of many people who believes that
p343
aVthis focus on gadgets,
p344
aVon accessorizing \u2014
p345
aVWhat can I add to my house,
p346
aVwhat can I add to what I've already got
p347
aVto make my lifestyle more sustainable? \u2014
p348
aVhas kind of dominated the discussion.
p349
aVSo I'm not immune to this.
p350
aVMy wife and I built a new house
p351
aVon an abandoned lot in Washington, D.C.,
p352
aVand we did our best to clear the shelves
p353
aVof the sustainability store.
p354
aVWe've got the solar photovoltaic system,
p355
aVsolar hot water heater, dual-flush toilets,
p356
aVbamboo floors.
p357
aVA log burning in my German high-tech stove
p358
aVapparently, supposedly, contributes less carbon
p359
aVto the atmosphere than were it left alone
p360
aVto decompose in the forest.
p361
aVYet all of these innovations \u2014
p362
aVThat's what they said in the brochure.
p363
aV(Laughter)
p364
aVAll of these innovations together
p365
aVcontribute a fraction of what we contribute
p366
aVby living in a walkable neighborhood
p367
aVthree blocks from a metro in the heart of a city.
p368
aVWe've changed all our light bulbs to energy-savers,
p369
aVand you should do the same thing,
p370
aVbut changing all your light bulbs to energy-savers
p371
aVsaves as much energy in a year
p372
aVas moving to a walkable city does in a week.
p373
aa(lp374
VAnd we don't want to have this argument.
p375
aVPoliticians and marketers are afraid
p376
aVof marketing green as a "lifestyle choice."
p377
aVYou don't want to tell Americans, God forbid,
p378
aVthat they have to change their lifestyle.
p379
aVBut what if lifestyle was really about quality of life
p380
aVand about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more,
p381
aVsomething that would be better than what we have right now?
p382
aa(lp383
VWell, the gold standard of quality of life rankings,
p384
aVit's called the Mercer Survey.
p385
aVYou may have heard of it.
p386
aVThey rank hundreds of nations worldwide
p387
aVaccording to 10 criteria that they believe add up
p388
aVto quality of life: health, economics, education,
p389
aVhousing, you name it.
p390
aVThere's six more. Short talk.
p391
aa(lp392
V(Laughter)
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd it's very interesting to see that
p395
aVthe highest-ranking American city, Honolulu,
p396
aVnumber 28, is followed by kind of the usual suspects
p397
aVof Seattle and Boston and all walkable cities.
p398
aVThe driving cities in the Sun Belt,
p399
aVthe Dallases and the Phoenixes and, sorry, Atlanta,
p400
aVthese cities are not appearing on the list.
p401
aVBut who's doing even better?
p402
aVThe Canadian cities like Vancouver,
p403
aVwhere again, they're burning half the fuel.
p404
aVAnd then it's usually won by cities where they speak German,
p405
aVlike Dusseldorf or Vienna,
p406
aVwhere they're burning, again, half as much fuel.
p407
aVAnd you see this alignment, this strange alignment.
p408
aa(lp409
VIs being more sustainble
p410
aVwhat gives you a higher quality of life?
p411
aVI would argue the same thing
p412
aVthat makes you more sustainble
p413
aVis what gives you a higher quality of life,
p414
aVand that's living in a walkable neighborhood.
p415
aVSo sustainability, which includes our wealth
p416
aVand our health
p417
aVmay not be a direct function of our sustainability.
p418
aVBut particularly here in America,
p419
aVwe are polluting so much
p420
aVbecause we're throwing away our time
p421
aVand our money and our lives on the highway,
p422
aVthen these two problems would seem to share
p423
aVthe same solution, which is to make our cities
p424
aVmore walkable.
p425
aa(lp426
VDoing so isn't easy, but it can be done,
p427
aVit has been done,
p428
aVand it's being done now in more than a few cities,
p429
aVaround the globe and in our country.
p430
aVI take some solace from Winston Churchill,
p431
aVwho put it this way:
p432
aV"The Americans can be counted on
p433
aVto do the right thing
p434
aVonce they have exhausted the alternatives." (Laughter)
p435
