VI think it's safe to say
p4
aVthat all humans will be intimate with death
p5
aVat least once in their lives.
p6
aVBut what if that intimacy began
p7
aVlong before you faced your own transition
p8
aVfrom life into death?
p9
aVWhat would life be like
p10
aVif the dead literally lived alongside you?
p11
aa(lp12
VIn my husband's homeland
p13
aVin the highlands of Sulawesi island
p14
aVin eastern Indonesia,
p15
aVthere is a community of people that experience death
p16
aVnot as a singular event
p17
aVbut as a gradual social process.
p18
aVIn Tana Toraja,
p19
aVthe most important social moments in people's lives,
p20
aVthe focal points of social and cultural interaction
p21
aVare not weddings or births or even family dinners,
p22
aVbut funerals.
p23
aVSo these funerals are characterized
p24
aVby elaborate rituals
p25
aVthat tie people in a system of reciprocal debt
p26
aVbased on the amount of animals \u2014
p27
aVpigs, chickens and, most importantly, water buffalo \u2014
p28
aVthat are sacrificed and distributed
p29
aVin the name of the deceased.
p30
aVSo this cultural complex surrounding death,
p31
aVthe ritual enactment of the end of life,
p32
aVhas made death the most visible
p33
aVand remarkable aspect of Toraja's landscape.
p34
aVLasting anywhere from a few days
p35
aVto a few weeks,
p36
aVfuneral ceremonies are a raucous affair,
p37
aVwhere commemorating someone who's died
p38
aVis not so much a private sadness
p39
aVbut more of a publicly shared transition.
p40
aVAnd it's a transition that's just as much
p41
aVabout the identity of the living
p42
aVas it is about remembrance of the dead.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo every year, thousands of visitors
p45
aVcome to Tana Toraja to see, as it were,
p46
aVthis culture of death,
p47
aVand for many people these grandiose ceremonies
p48
aVand the length of the ceremonies
p49
aVare somehow incommensurable
p50
aVwith the way that we face our own mortality in the West.
p51
aVSo even as we share death as a universal experience,
p52
aVit's not experienced the same way the world over.
p53
aVAnd as an anthropologist,
p54
aVI see these differences in experience
p55
aVbeing rooted in the cultural and social world
p56
aVthrough which we define the phenomena around us.
p57
aVSo where we see an unquestionable reality,
p58
aVdeath as an irrefutable biological condition,
p59
aVTorajans see the expired corporeal form
p60
aVas part of a larger social genesis.
p61
aVSo again, the physical cessation of life
p62
aVis not the same as death.
p63
aVIn fact, a member of society is only truly dead
p64
aVwhen the extended family can agree upon
p65
aVand marshal the resources necessary
p66
aVto hold a funeral ceremony
p67
aVthat is considered appropriate in terms of resources
p68
aVfor the status of the deceased.
p69
aVAnd this ceremony has to take place
p70
aVin front of the eyes of the whole community
p71
aVwith everyone's participation.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo after a person's physical death,
p74
aVtheir body is placed in a special room
p75
aVin the traditional residence, which is called the tongkonan.
p76
aVAnd the tongkonan is symbolic
p77
aVnot only of the family's identity
p78
aVbut also of the human life cycle from birth to death.
p79
aVSo essentially, the shape of the building
p80
aVthat you're born into is the shape
p81
aVof the structure which carries you
p82
aVto your ancestral resting place.
p83
aVUntil the funeral ceremony,
p84
aVwhich can be held years after a person's physical death,
p85
aVthe deceased is referred to as "to makala," a sick person,
p86
aVor "to mama," a person who is asleep,
p87
aVand they continue to be a member of the household.
p88
aVThey are symbolically fed and cared for,
p89
aVand the family at this time
p90
aVwill begin a number of ritual injunctions,
p91
aVwhich communicates to the wider community around them
p92
aVthat one of their members is undergoing the transition
p93
aVfrom this life into the afterlife
p94
aVknown as Puya.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo I know what some of you must be thinking right now.
p97
aVIs she really saying that these people live
p98
aVwith the bodies of their dead relatives?
p99
aVAnd that's exactly what I'm saying.
p100
aa(lp101
VBut instead of giving in to the sort of visceral reaction
p102
aVwe have to this idea of proximity to bodies,
p103
aVproximity to death,
p104
aVor how this notion just does not fit
p105
aVinto our very biological or medical
p106
aVsort of definition of death,
p107
aVI like to think about what the Torajan way
p108
aVof viewing death encompasses of the human experience
p109
aVthat the medical definition leaves out.
p110
aVI think that Torajans socially recognize
p111
aVand culturally express
p112
aVwhat many of us feel to be true
p113
aVdespite the widespread acceptance
p114
aVof the biomedical definition of death,
p115
aVand that is that our relationships with other humans,
p116
aVtheir impact on our social reality,
p117
aVdoesn't cease with the termination
p118
aVof the physical processes of the body,
p119
aVthat there's a period of transition
p120
aVas the relationship between the living and the dead
p121
aVis transformed but not ended.
p122
aVSo Torajans express this idea of this enduring relationship
p123
aVby lavishing love and attention
p124
aVon the most visible symbol of that relationship,
p125
aVthe human body.
p126
aVSo my husband has fond memories
p127
aVof talking to and playing with
p128
aVand generally being around his deceased grandfather,
p129
aVand for him there is nothing unnatural about this.
p130
aVThis is a natural part of the process
p131
aVas the family comes to terms with the transition
p132
aVin their relationship to the deceased,
p133
aVand this is the transition from relating to the deceased
p134
aVas a person who's living
p135
aVto relating to the deceased
p136
aVas a person who's an ancestor.
p137
aVAnd here you can see these wooden effigies
p138
aVof the ancestors,
p139
aVso these are people who have already been buried,
p140
aValready had a funeral ceremony.
p141
aVThese are called tau tau.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo the funeral ceremony itself
p144
aVembodies this relational perspective on death.
p145
aVIt ritualizes the impact of death on families
p146
aVand communities.
p147
aVAnd it's also a moment of self-awareness.
p148
aVIt's a moment when people think about who they are,
p149
aVtheir place in society,
p150
aVand their role in the life cycle
p151
aVin accordance with Torajan cosmology.
p152
aa(lp153
VThere's a saying in Toraja
p154
aVthat all people will become grandparents,
p155
aVand what this means is that after death,
p156
aVwe all become part of the ancestral line
p157
aVthat anchors us between the past and the present
p158
aVand will define who our loved ones are into the future.
p159
aVSo essentially, we all become grandparents
p160
aVto the generations of human children
p161
aVthat come after us.
p162
aVAnd this metaphor of membership
p163
aVin the greater human family
p164
aVis the way that children also describe
p165
aVthe money that they invest
p166
aVin these sacrificial buffaloes
p167
aVthat are thought to carry people's soul
p168
aVfrom here to the afterlife,
p169
aVand children will explain
p170
aVthat they will invest the money in this
p171
aVbecause they want to repay their parents
p172
aVthe debt for all of the years their parents spent
p173
aVinvesting and caring for them.
p174
aa(lp175
VBut the sacrifice of buffalo
p176
aVand the ritual display of wealth
p177
aValso exhibits the status of the deceased,
p178
aVand, by extension, the deceased's family.
p179
aVSo at funerals, relationships are reconfirmed
p180
aVbut also transformed
p181
aVin a ritual drama that highlights
p182
aVthe most salient feature about death in this place:
p183
aVits impact on life and the relationships of the living.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo all of this focus on death
p186
aVdoesn't mean that Torajans don't aspire
p187
aVto the ideal of a long life.
p188
aVThey engage in many practices
p189
aVthought to confer good health
p190
aVand survival to an advanced age.
p191
aVBut they don't put much stock
p192
aVin efforts to prolong life in the face of debilitating illness
p193
aVor in old age.
p194
aVIt's said in Toraja that everybody has
p195
aVsort of a predetermined amount of life.
p196
aVIt's called the sunga'.
p197
aVAnd like a thread, it should be allowed to unspool
p198
aVto its natural end.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo by having death as a part
p201
aVof the cultural and social fabric of life,
p202
aVpeople's everyday decisions about their health
p203
aVand healthcare are affected.
p204
aVThe patriarch of my husband's maternal clan,
p205
aVNenet Katcha,
p206
aVis now approaching the age of 100, as far as we can tell.
p207
aVAnd there are increasing signs
p208
aVthat he is about to depart on his own journey for Puya.
p209
aVAnd his death will be greatly mourned.
p210
aVBut I know that my husband's family
p211
aVlooks forward to the moment
p212
aVwhen they can ritually display
p213
aVwhat his remarkable presence has meant to their lives,
p214
aVwhen they can ritually recount
p215
aVhis life's narrative,
p216
aVweaving his story
p217
aVinto the history of their community.
p218
aVHis story is their story.
p219
aVHis funeral songs will sing them a song about themselves.
p220
aVAnd it's a story that has no discernible beginning,
p221
aVno foreseeable end.
p222
aVIt's a story that goes on
p223
aVlong after his body no longer does.
p224
aa(lp225
VPeople ask me if I'm frightened or repulsed
p226
aVby participating in a culture
p227
aVwhere the physical manifestations of death
p228
aVgreet us at every turn.
p229
aVBut I see something profoundly transformative
p230
aVin experiencing death as a social process
p231
aVand not just a biological one.
p232
aVIn reality, the relationship between the living and the dead
p233
aVhas its own drama in the U.S. healthcare system,
p234
aVwhere decisions about how long to stretch
p235
aVthe thread of life are made based on our emotional
p236
aVand social ties with the people around us,
p237
aVnot just on medicine's ability to prolong life.
p238
aVWe, like the Torajans,
p239
aVbase our decisions about life
p240
aVon the meanings and the definitions
p241
aVthat we ascribe to death.
p242
aa(lp243
VSo I'm not suggesting that anyone in this audience
p244
aVshould run out and adopt the traditions
p245
aVof the Torajans.
p246
aVIt might be a little bit difficult
p247
aVto put into play in the United States.
p248
aVBut I want to ask what we can gain
p249
aVfrom seeing physical death not only as a biological process
p250
aVbut as part of the greater human story.
p251
aVWhat would it be like to look on
p252
aVthe expired human form with love
p253
aVbecause it's so intimately a part of who we all are?
p254
aVIf we could expand our definition of death
p255
aVto encompass life,
p256
aVwe could experience death as part of life
p257
aVand perhaps face death
p258
aVwith something other than fear.
p259
aVPerhaps one of the answers to the challenges
p260
aVthat are facing the U.S. healthcare system,
p261
aVparticularly in the end-of-life care,
p262
aVis as simple as a shift in perspective,
p263
aVand the shift in perspective in this case
p264
aVwould be to look at the social life of every death.
p265
aVIt might help us recognize that the way we limit
p266
aVour conversation about death
p267
aVto something that's medical or biological
p268
aVis reflective of a larger culture that we all share
p269
aVof avoiding death, being afraid of talking about it.
p270
aVIf we could entertain and value
p271
aVother kinds of knowledge about life,
p272
aVincluding other definitions of death,
p273
aVit has the potential to change the discussions
p274
aVthat we have about the end of life.
p275
aVIt could change the way that we die,
p276
aVbut more importantly,
p277
aVit could transform the way that we live.
