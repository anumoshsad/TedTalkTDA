VIn this rather long sort of marathon presentation,
p4
aVI've tried to break it up into three parts:
p5
aVthe first being a whole lot of examples on how it can be
p6
aVa little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computer
p7
aVand really address the qualities of the human interface.
p8
aVAnd these will be some simple design qualities
p9
aVand they will also be some qualities of, if you will,
p10
aVthe intelligence of interaction.
p11
aVThen the second part will really just be examples of new technologies \u2014
p12
aVnew media falling very much into that mold.
p13
aVAgain, I will go through them as fast as possible.
p14
aVAnd then the last one will be some examples
p15
aVI've been able to collect, which I think
p16
aVillustrate this at least as best I can, in the world of entertainment.
p17
aVPeople have this belief \u2014 and I share most of it \u2014
p18
aVthat we will be using the TV screens or their equivalents
p19
aVfor electronic books of the future. But then you think,
p20
aV"My God! What a terrible image you get when you look at still pictures on TV."
p21
aVWell, it doesn't have to be terrible.
p22
aVAnd that is a slide taken from a TV set
p23
aVand it was pre-processed to be very sympathetic to the TV medium,
p24
aVand it absolutely looks beautiful.
p25
aa(lp26
VWell, what's happened? How did people get into this mess?
p27
aVWhere you are now, all of a sudden,
p28
aVsitting in front of personal computers
p29
aVand video text \u2014 teletext systems,
p30
aVand somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen?
p31
aVWell, you have to remember that TV was designed
p32
aVto be looked at eight times the distance of the diagonal.
p33
aVSo you get a 13-inch, 19-inch, whatever, TV,
p34
aVand then you should multiply that by eight
p35
aVand that's the distance you should sit away from the TV set.
p36
aVNow we've put people 18 inches in front of a TV,
p37
aVand all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen,
p38
aVall of a sudden, are staring you in the face:
p39
aVthe shadow mask, the scan lines, all of that.
p40
aVAnd they can be treated very easily;
p41
aVthere are actually ways of getting rid of them,
p42
aVthere are actually ways of just making absolutely beautiful pictures.
p43
aVI'm talking here a little bit about display technologies.
p44
aa(lp45
VLet me talk about how you might input information.
p46
aVAnd my favorite example is always fingers.
p47
aVI'm very interested in touch-sensitive displays.
p48
aVHigh-tech, high-touch. Isn't that what some of you said?
p49
aVIt's certainly a very important medium for input,
p50
aVand a lot of people think that fingers are a very low-resolution
p51
aVsort of stylus for inputting to a display.
p52
aVIn fact, they're not: it's really a very, very high-resolution input medium \u2014
p53
aVyou have to just do it twice, you have to touch the screen
p54
aVand then rotate your finger slightly \u2014
p55
aVand you can move a cursor with great accuracy.
p56
aVAnd so when you see on the market these systems
p57
aVthat have just a few light emitting diodes on the side and are very low resolution,
p58
aVit's nice that they exist because it still is better than nothing.
p59
aVBut it, in some sense, misses the point:
p60
aVnamely, that fingers are a very, very high-resolution input medium.
p61
aVNow, what are some of the other advantages?
p62
aVWell, the one advantage is that you don't have to pick them up,
p63
aVand people don't realize how important that is \u2014
p64
aVnot having to pick up your fingers to use them. (Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VWhen you think for a second of the mouse on Macintosh \u2014
p67
aVand I will not criticize the mouse too much \u2014
p68
aVwhen you're typing \u2014 what you have \u2014 you want to now put something \u2014
p69
aVfirst of all, you've got to find the mouse.
p70
aVYou have to probably stop. Maybe not come to a grinding halt,
p71
aVbut you've got to sort of find that mouse. Then you find the mouse,
p72
aVand you're going to have to wiggle it a little bit
p73
aVto see where the cursor is on the screen.
p74
aVAnd then when you finally see where it is,
p75
aVthen you've got to move it to get the cursor over there,
p76
aVand then \u2014 "Bang" \u2014 you've got to hit a button or do whatever.
p77
aVThat's four separate steps versus typing and then touching
p78
aVand typing and just doing it all in one motion \u2014
p79
aVor one-and-a-half, depending on how you want to count.
p80
aVAgain, what I'm trying to do is just illustrate
p81
aVthe kinds of problems that I think face the designers
p82
aVof new computer systems and entertainment systems
p83
aVand educational systems
p84
aVfrom the perspective of the quality of that interface.
p85
aa(lp86
VAnd another advantage, of course, of using fingers is you have 10 of them.
p87
aVAnd we have never known how to do this technically,
p88
aVso this slide is a fake slide.
p89
aVWe never succeeded in using ten fingers,
p90
aVbut there are certain things you can do, obviously,
p91
aVwith more than one-finger input, which is rather fascinating.
p92
aVWhat we did stumble across was something ...
p93
aVAgain, which is typical of the computer field,
p94
aVis when you have a bug that you can't get rid of you turn it into a feature.
p95
aVAnd maybe ... (Laughter)
p96
aVmaybe a mouse is a new kind of bug.
p97
aVBut the bug in our case was in touch-sensitive displays:
p98
aVwe wanted to be able to draw \u2014 you know, rub your finger
p99
aVacross the screen to input continuous points \u2014
p100
aVand there was just too much friction
p101
aVcreated between your finger and the glass \u2014
p102
aVif glass was the substrate, which it usually is.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo we found that that actually was a feature
p105
aVin the sense you could build a pressure-sensitive display.
p106
aVAnd when you touch it with your finger,
p107
aVyou can actually, then, introduce all the forces on the face of that screen,
p108
aVand that actually has a certain amount of value.
p109
aVLet me see if I can load another disc
p110
aVand show you, quickly, an example.
p111
aVNow, imagine a screen, which is not only touch-sensitive now,
p112
aVit's pressure-sensitive.
p113
aVAnd it's pressure-sensitive to the forces both in the plane of the screen \u2014
p114
aVX, Y, and Z at least in one direction;
p115
aVwe couldn't figure out how to come in the other direction.
p116
aVBut let me get rid of the slide,
p117
aVand let's see if this comes on.
p118
aVOK. So there is the pressure-sensitive display in operation.
p119
aVThe person's just, if you will, pushing on the screen to make a curve.
p120
aVBut this is the interesting part.
p121
aa(lp122
VI want to stop it for a second
p123
aVbecause the movie is very badly made.
p124
aVAnd the particular display was built about six years ago,
p125
aVand when we moved from one room to another room,
p126
aVa rather large person sat on it and it got destroyed.
p127
aVSo all we have is this record. (Laughter)
p128
aVBut imagine that screen having lots of objects on it
p129
aVand the person has touched an object \u2014
p130
aVone of N \u2014 like he did there, and then pushed on it.
p131
aVNow, imagine a program
p132
aVwhere some of those objects are physically heavy and some are light:
p133
aVone is an anvil on a fuzzy rug
p134
aVand the other one is a ping-pong ball on a sheet of glass.
p135
aVAnd when you touch it, you have to really push very hard
p136
aVto move that anvil across the screen,
p137
aVand yet you touch the ping-pong ball very lightly
p138
aVand it just scoots across the screen.
p139
aVAnd what you can do \u2014 oops, I didn't mean to do that \u2014
p140
aVwhat you can do is actually feed back to the user
p141
aVthe feeling of the physical properties.
p142
aVSo again, they don't have to be weight;
p143
aVthey could be a general trying to move troops,
p144
aVand he's got to move an aircraft carrier versus a little boat.
p145
aVIn fact, they funded it for that very reason.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VThe whole notion, then, is one that at the interface
p150
aVthere are physical properties in that transducer \u2014
p151
aVin this case it's pressure and touches \u2014
p152
aVthat allow you to present things to the user that you could never present before.
p153
aVSo it's not simply looking at the quality or, if you will, the luxury of that interface,
p154
aVbut it's actually looking at the idea
p155
aVof presenting things that previously couldn't be presented before.
p156
aVI want to move on to another example,
p157
aVwhich is one of a different sort, where we're trying to use computer
p158
aVand video disc technology now to come up with a new kind of book.
p159
aVHere, the idea is that you're going to take this book,
p160
aVif you will, and it's going to come alive.
p161
aVYou're going to sort of breathe life into it.
p162
aVWe are so used to doing monologues.
p163
aVFilmmakers, for example, are the experts in monologue making:
p164
aVyou make a film and it has a well-formed beginning, middle and end,
p165
aVand in some sense the art of it is that.
p166
aVAnd you then say, "There's an opportunity
p167
aVfor making conversational movies." Well, what does that mean?
p168
aVAnd it sort of nibbles at the core of the whole profession
p169
aVand all the assumptions of that medium.
p170
aVSo, book writing is the same thing.
p171
aa(lp172
VWhat I'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book
p173
aVwhere it is mixed now with ... all sorts of things live in there,
p174
aVbut you have to keep a few things in mind.
p175
aVOne is that this book knows about itself.
p176
aVEach frame of the movie has information about itself.
p177
aVSo it knows, or at least there is computer-readable information
p178
aVin the medium itself. It's just not a static movie frame.
p179
aVThat's one thing. The other is that you have to realize
p180
aVthat it is a random access medium,
p181
aVand you can, in fact, branch and expand and elaborate and shrink.
p182
aVAnd here \u2014 again, my favorite example \u2014 is the cookbook,
p183
aVthe "Larousse Gastronomique."
p184
aVAnd I think I use the example all too often,
p185
aVbut it's a great one because there is a classic ending in that little
p186
aVencyclopedia-style cookbook that tells you how to do something like penguin,
p187
aVand you get to the end of the recipe and it says, "Cook until done."
p188
aVNow, that would be, if you will, the top green track,
p189
aVwhich doesn't mean too much. But you might have to elaborate for me
p190
aVor for somebody who isn't an expert, and say,
p191
aV"Cook at 380 degrees for 45 minutes."
p192
aVAnd then for a real beginner, you would go down even further
p193
aVand elaborate more \u2014 say, "Open the oven, preheat, wait for the light to go out,
p194
aVopen the door, don't leave it open too long,
p195
aVput the penguin in and shut the door ..." (Laughter) whatever.
p196
aVAnd that's a much more elaborate one than you dribble back.
p197
aa(lp198
VThat's one kind of use of random access.
p199
aVAnd the other is where you want to explain the same thing in different ways.
p200
aVIf you're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question,
p201
aVthe last thing you do is repeat what you just said.
p202
aVYou try and think of a different way of saying the same thing,
p203
aVor if you know the particular student and that student's cognitive style,
p204
aVthen you might say it in a way that you think
p205
aVwould have a good impedance match with that student.
p206
aVThere are all sorts of techniques you will use \u2014
p207
aVand again, this is a different kind of branching.
p208
aVSo, what I will show you is ... it's a rather boring book,
p209
aVbut I'm afraid sometimes you have to do boring books
p210
aVbecause your sponsors aren't necessarily interested in fiction
p211
aVand entertainment. And this is a book on how to repair a transmission.
p212
aVNow, I don't even know what vintage the transmission is,
p213
aVbut let me just show you very quickly some of it, and we'll move on.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Video) Narrator: And continue to get descriptions for each of these chapters.
p216
aVNicholas Negroponte: Now, this is his table of contents.
p217
aVJust a picture of the transmission, and as you rub your finger across the transmission
p218
aVit highlights the various parts.
p219
aa(lp220
VNarrator: When I find a chapter that I want to see,
p221
aVI just touch the text and the system will format pages for me to read.
p222
aVThe words or phrases that are lit up in red are glossary words,
p223
aVso I can get a different definition by just touching the word,
p224
aVand the definition appears, superimposed over the illustration.
p225
aa(lp226
VNN: This is about the oil pan, or the oil filter and all that.
p227
aVThis is relatively important because it sets the page ...
p228
aa(lp229
VNarrator: This is another example of a page with glossary words
p230
aVhighlighted in red.
p231
aVI can get a definition of these words just by touching them,
p232
aVand the definition will appear in the illustration corner.
p233
aVI can get back to the illustration, but in this case it's not a single frame,
p234
aVbut it's actually a movie of someone coming into the frame and doing the repair
p235
aVthat's described in the text.
p236
aVThe two-headed slider is a speed control that allows me to watch the movie
p237
aVat various speeds, in forward or reverse.
p238
aVAnd the movie is displayed as a full frame movie.
p239
aVI can go back to the beginning ... and play the movie at full speed.
p240
aVHere's another step-by-step procedure, only in this case \u2014
p241
aa(lp242
VNN: Okay, this movie is ... Everybody's heard of sound-sync movies \u2014
p243
aVthis is text-sync movies, so as the movie plays, the text gets highlighted.
p244
aVWe highlight the text as we go through the movie.
p245
aVRepairman: ... Not too far out. Front poles, preferably.
p246
aVDon't loosen them too far. If you loosen them too far, you'll have a big mess.
p247
aVNN: I suspect that some of you might not even understand that language.
p248
aa(lp249
V(Laughter)
p250
aa(lp251
VOK. I'm at the third and last part of this,
p252
aVwhich I said I would make an attempt to at least give you some examples
p253
aVthat may be more directly related to the world of entertainment.
p254
aVAnd of course, good education has got to be good entertainment,
p255
aVso my first example will be drawn from a very recent experiment
p256
aVthat we've been doing \u2014 in this case, in Senegal \u2014
p257
aVwhere we have tried to use personal computers
p258
aVas a pedagogical medium. But not as teaching machines at all;
p259
aVthe whole notion is to use this as an instrument
p260
aVwhere there is a complete reversal of roles \u2014
p261
aVthe child is, if you will, the teacher and the machine is the student \u2014
p262
aVand the art of computer programming is a vehicle that sort of
p263
aVapproximates thinking about thinking.
p264
aVBut teaching kids programming per se is utterly irrelevant.
p265
aVAnd there are just a few slides I want to go through,
p266
aa(lp267
Vbut there's a story I'd like to tell. And that was when,
p268
aVbefore we did this in any developing countries \u2014
p269
aVwe're doing it, in fact, in three developing countries right now:
p270
aVPakistan, Colombia and Senegal \u2014
p271
aVwe did it in some pretty rough areas of New York City.
p272
aVAnd one child, whose name I've forgotten, was about seven or eight years old,
p273
aVabsolutely considered mentally handicapped \u2014
p274
aVcouldn't read, didn't even make it in the lowest section of the school's classes \u2014
p275
aVand was pretty much not in school, though physically there.
p276
aVBut did hang around the, quote, "computer room,"
p277
aVwhere there were quite a few computers,
p278
aVand learned this particular language called Logo \u2014
p279
aVand learned it with great ease and found it a lot of fun,
p280
aVit was very interesting. And one day, by chance,
p281
aVsome visitors from the NIE came by in their double-breasted suits
p282
aVlooking at this setup, and none of the children who were normally there,
p283
aVexcept for this one child, were there.
p284
aa(lp285
VHe was, and he said, "Let me show you how this works,"
p286
aVand they got an absolutely ingenuous, wonderful description of Logo.
p287
aVAnd the child was just zipping right through it, showing them all sorts of things
p288
aVuntil they asked him how to do something which he couldn't explain
p289
aVand so he flipped through the manual, found the explanation
p290
aVand typed the command and got it to do what they asked.
p291
aVThey were delighted, and by the time it was time to go see the principal,
p292
aVwhom they'd actually come to see \u2014 not the computer room \u2014
p293
aVthey went upstairs and they said,
p294
aV"This is absolutely remarkable!
p295
aVThat child was very articulate and showed us
p296
aVand even dealt with the things he couldn't do automatically
p297
aVwith that manual. It was just absolutely fantastic."
p298
aa(lp299
VThe principal said, "There's a dreadful mistake,
p300
aVbecause that child can't read.
p301
aVAnd you obviously have been hoodwinked
p302
aVor you've talked about somebody else."
p303
aVAnd they all got up and they all went downstairs
p304
aVand the child was still there. And they did something very intelligent:
p305
aVthey asked the child, "Can you read?"
p306
aVAnd the child said, "No, I can't."
p307
aVAnd then they said, "But wait a minute. You
p308
aVjust looked through that manual and you found ... "
p309
aVand he said, "Oh, but that's not reading."
p310
aVAnd so they said, "Well, what's reading then?"
p311
aVHe says, "Well, reading is this junk they give me in little books to read.
p312
aVIt's absolutely irrelevant, (Laughter) and I get nothing for it.
p313
aVBut here, with a little bit of effort I get a lot of return."
p314
aa(lp315
VAnd it really meant something to the child.
p316
aVThe child read beautifully, it turned out,
p317
aVand was really very competent. So it actually meant something.
p318
aVAnd that story has many other anecdotes that are similar,
p319
aVbut wow. The key to the future of computers in education is right there,
p320
aVand it is: when does it mean something to a child?
p321
aVThere is a myth, and it truly is a myth:
p322
aVwe believe \u2014 and I'm sure a lot of you believe in this room \u2014
p323
aVthat it is harder to read and write than it is to learn how to speak.
p324
aVAnd it's not, but we think speech \u2014 "My God, little children pick it up somehow,
p325
aVand by the age of two they're doing a mediocre job,
p326
aVand by three and four they're speaking reasonably well.
p327
aVAnd yet you've got to go to school to learn how to read,
p328
aVand you have to sit in a classroom and somebody has to teach you.
p329
aVHence, it must be harder." Well, it's not harder.
p330
aVWhat the truth is is that speaking has great value to a child;
p331
aVthe child can get a great deal by talking to you.
p332
aa(lp333
VReading and writing is utterly useless.
p334
aVThere is no reason for a child to read and write except blind faith,
p335
aVand that it's going to help you. (Laughter)
p336
aVSo what happens is you go to school and people say,
p337
aV"Just believe me, you're going to like it.
p338
aVYou're going to like reading," and just read and read.
p339
aVOn the other hand, you give a kid \u2014 a three-year-old kid \u2014 a computer
p340
aVand they type a little command and \u2014 Poof! \u2014 something happens.
p341
aVAnd all of a sudden ... You may not call that reading and writing,
p342
aVbut a certain bit of typing and reading stuff on the screen
p343
aVhas a huge payoff, and it's a lot of fun.
p344
aVAnd in fact, it's a powerful educational instrument.
p345
aVWell, in Senegal we found that this was the traditional classroom:
p346
aV120 kids \u2014 three per desk \u2014 one teacher, a little bit of chalk.
p347
aVThis student was one of our first students,
p348
aVand it's the girl on the left leaning with her chalkboard,
p349
aVand she came ... within two days \u2014
p350
aVI want to show you the program she wrote,
p351
aVand remember her hairstyle. And that is the program she made.
p352
aa(lp353
VThat's what meant something to her, is doing the hair pattern,
p354
aVand actually did it within two days \u2014 an hour each day \u2014
p355
aVand found it was, to her,
p356
aVabsolutely the most meaningful piece ...
p357
aVBut rooted in that, little did she know how much knowledge
p358
aVshe was acquiring about geometry
p359
aVand just math and logic and all the rest.
p360
aVAnd again, I could talk for three hours about this subject.
p361
aVI will come to my last example and then quit.
p362
aVAnd my last example \u2014 as some of my former colleagues,
p363
aVwhom I see in the room, can imagine what it will be.
p364
aVYes, it is. It's our work \u2014 that was a while ago,
p365
aVand it still is my favorite project \u2014 of teleconferencing.
p366
aVAnd the reason it remains a favorite project
p367
aVis that we were asked to do a teleconferencing system
p368
aVwhere you had the following situation:
p369
aVyou had five people at five different sites \u2014 they were known people \u2014
p370
aVand you had to have these people in teleconference,
p371
aVsuch that each one was utterly convinced
p372
aVthat the other four were physically present.
p373
aVNow, that is sufficiently
p374
aVzany that we would, obviously, jump to the bait, and we did.
p375
aVAnd the fact that we knew the people \u2014
p376
aVwe had to take a page out of the history of Walt Disney \u2014
p377
aVwe actually went so far as to build CRTs
p378
aVin the shapes of the people's faces.
p379
aVSo if I wanted to call my friend Peter Sprague on the phone,
p380
aVmy secretary would get his head out and bring it and set it on the desk,

Vand that would be the TV used for the occasion.
p385
aVAnd it's uncanny: there's no way I can explain to you
p386
aVthe amount of eye contact you get with that physical face
p387
aVprojected on a 3D CRT of that sort.
p388
aVThe next thing that we had to do is to persuade them
p389
aVthat there needed to be spatial correspondence, which is straightforward,
p390
aVbut again, it's something that didn't fall naturally
p391
aVout of a telecommunications or computing style of thinking;
p392
aVit was a very, if you will, architectural or spatial concept.
p393
aVAnd that was to recognize that when you sit around the table,
p394
aVthe actual location of the people becomes rather important.
p395
aVAnd when somebody gets up, in fact, to go answer a phone
p396
aVor use a bathroom or something, the empty seat becomes,
p397
aVif you will, that person. And you point frequently to the empty seat
p398
aVand you say, "He or she wouldn't agree,"
p399
aVand the empty chair is that person and the spatiality is crucial.
p400
aVSo we said, "Well, these will be on round tables
p401
aVand the order around the table had to be the same,
p402
aVso that at my site, I would be, if you will, real
p403
aVand then at each other's site you'd have these plastic heads.
p404
aVAnd the plastic heads, sometimes you want to project them.
p405
aVAnd there are a number of schemes, which I don't want to dwell on,
p406
aa(lp407
Vbut this is the one that we finally used
p408
aVwhere we projected onto rear screen material
p409
aVthat was molded in the face \u2014 literally in the face of the person.
p410
aVAnd I'll show you one more slide, where this is actually made
p411
aVfrom something called a solid photograph and is the screen.
p412
aVNow, we track, on the person's head, the head motions \u2014
p413
aVso we transmit with a video the head positions \u2014
p414
aVand so this head moves in about two axes.
p415
aVSo if I, all of a sudden, turn to the person to my left
p416
aVand start talking to that person, then at the person to my right's site,
p417
aVhe'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other.
p418
aVAnd then if that person interrupts, then those two heads may turn.
p419
aVAnd it really is reconstructing, quite accurately, teleconferencing.
