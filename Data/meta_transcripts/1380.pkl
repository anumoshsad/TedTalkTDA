VWhat do I know
p4
aVthat would cause me,
p5
aVa reticent, Midwestern scientist,
p6
aVto get myself arrested
p7
aVin front of the White House protesting?
p8
aVAnd what would you do
p9
aVif you knew what I know?
p10
aVLet's start with how I got to this point.
p11
aVI was lucky to grow up
p12
aVat a time when it was not difficult
p13
aVfor the child of a tenant farmer
p14
aVto make his way to the state university.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd I was really lucky
p17
aVto go to the University of Iowa
p18
aVwhere I could study under Professor James Van Allen
p19
aVwho built instruments
p20
aVfor the first U.S. satellites.
p21
aVProfessor Van Allen told me
p22
aVabout observations of Venus,
p23
aVthat there was intense microwave radiation.
p24
aVDid it mean that Venus had an ionosphere?
p25
aVOr was Venus extremely hot?
p26
aVThe right answer,
p27
aVconfirmed by the Soviet Venera spacecraft,
p28
aVwas that Venus was very hot \u2014
p29
aV900 degrees Fahrenheit.
p30
aVAnd it was kept hot
p31
aVby a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere.
p32
aa(lp33
VI was fortunate to join NASA
p34
aVand successfully propose
p35
aVan experiment to fly to Venus.
p36
aVOur instrument took this image
p37
aVof the veil of Venus,
p38
aVwhich turned out to be
p39
aVa smog of sulfuric acid.
p40
aVBut while our instrument was being built,
p41
aVI became involved in calculations
p42
aVof the greenhouse effect
p43
aVhere on Earth,
p44
aVbecause we realized
p45
aVthat our atmospheric composition was changing.
p46
aVEventually, I resigned
p47
aVas principal investigator
p48
aVon our Venus experiment
p49
aVbecause a planet changing before our eyes
p50
aVis more interesting and important.
p51
aVIts changes will affect all of humanity.
p52
aa(lp53
VThe greenhouse effect had been well understood
p54
aVfor more than a century.
p55
aVBritish physicist John Tyndall,
p56
aVin the 1850's,
p57
aVmade laboratory measurements
p58
aVof the infrared radiation,
p59
aVwhich is heat.
p60
aVAnd he showed that gasses such as CO2 absorb heat,
p61
aVthus acting like a blanket
p62
aVwarming Earth's surface.
p63
aa(lp64
VI worked with other scientists
p65
aVto analyze Earth climate observations.
p66
aVIn 1981,
p67
aVwe published an article in Science magazine
p68
aVconcluding that observed warming
p69
aVof 0.4 degrees Celsius
p70
aVin the prior century
p71
aVwas consistent with the greenhouse effect
p72
aVof increasing CO2.
p73
aVThat Earth would likely warm in the 1980's,
p74
aVand warming would exceed
p75
aVthe noise level of random weather
p76
aVby the end of the century.
p77
aVWe also said that the 21st century
p78
aVwould see shifting climate zones,
p79
aVcreation of drought-prone regions
p80
aVin North America and Asia,
p81
aVerosion of ice sheets, rising sea levels
p82
aVand opening of the fabled Northwest Passage.
p83
aVAll of these impacts
p84
aVhave since either happened
p85
aVor are now well under way.
p86
aa(lp87
VThat paper was reported on the front page of the New York Times
p88
aVand led to me testifying to Congress
p89
aVin the 1980's,
p90
aVtestimony in which I emphasized
p91
aVthat global warming increases both extremes
p92
aVof the Earth's water cycle.
p93
aVHeatwaves and droughts on one hand,
p94
aVdirectly from the warming,
p95
aVbut also, because a warmer atmosphere
p96
aVholds more water vapor
p97
aVwith its latent energy,
p98
aVrainfall will become
p99
aVin more extreme events.
p100
aVThere will be stronger storms and greater flooding.
p101
aVGlobal warming hoopla
p102
aVbecame time-consuming
p103
aVand distracted me from doing science \u2014
p104
aVpartly because I had complained
p105
aVthat the White House altered my testimony.
p106
aVSo I decided to go back
p107
aVto strictly doing science
p108
aVand leave the communication to others.
p109
aa(lp110
VBy 15 years later,
p111
aVevidence of global warming was much stronger.
p112
aVMost of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper
p113
aVwere facts.
p114
aVI had the privilege to speak twice
p115
aVto the president's climate task force.
p116
aVBut energy policies continued to focus
p117
aVon finding more fossil fuels.
p118
aVBy then we had two grandchildren,
p119
aVSophie and Connor.
p120
aVI decided
p121
aVthat I did not want them in the future
p122
aVto say, "Opa understood what was happening,
p123
aVbut he didn't make it clear."
p124
aVSo I decided to give a public talk
p125
aVcriticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy.
p126
aa(lp127
VI gave the talk at the University of Iowa in 2004
p128
aVand at the 2005 meeting
p129
aVof the American Geophysical Union.
p130
aVThis led to calls
p131
aVfrom the White House to NASA headquarters
p132
aVand I was told that I could not give any talks or speak with the media
p133
aVwithout prior explicit approval
p134
aVby NASA headquarters.
p135
aVAfter I informed the New York Times
p136
aVabout these restrictions,
p137
aVNASA was forced to end the censorship.
p138
aVBut there were consequences.
p139
aVI had been using the first line
p140
aVof the NASA mission statement,
p141
aV"To understand and protect the home planet,"
p142
aVto justify my talks.
p143
aVSoon the first line of the mission statement
p144
aVwas deleted, never to appear again.
p145
aa(lp146
VOver the next few years
p147
aVI was drawn more and more
p148
aVinto trying to communicate the urgency
p149
aVof a change in energy policies,
p150
aVwhile still researching the physics of climate change.
p151
aVLet me describe the most important conclusion from the physics \u2014
p152
aVfirst, from Earth's energy balance
p153
aVand, second, from Earth's climate history.
p154
aa(lp155
VAdding CO2 to the air
p156
aVis like throwing another blanket on the bed.
p157
aVIt reduces Earth's heat radiation to space,
p158
aVso there's a temporary energy imbalance.
p159
aVMore energy is coming in
p160
aVthan going out,
p161
aVuntil Earth warms up enough
p162
aVto again radiate to space
p163
aVas much energy as it absorbs from the Sun.
p164
aVSo the key quantity
p165
aVis Earth's energy imbalance.
p166
aVIs there more energy coming in
p167
aVthan going out?
p168
aVIf so, more warming is in the pipeline.
p169
aVIt will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses.
p170
aa(lp171
VNow finally,
p172
aVwe can measure Earth's energy imbalance precisely
p173
aVby measuring the heat content
p174
aVin Earth's heat reservoirs.
p175
aVThe biggest reservoir, the ocean, was the least well measured,
p176
aVuntil more than 3,000 Argo floats
p177
aVwere distributed around the world's ocean.
p178
aVThese floats reveal
p179
aVthat the upper half of the ocean
p180
aVis gaining heat at a substantial rate.
p181
aVThe deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate,
p182
aVand energy is going
p183
aVinto the net melting of ice all around the planet.
p184
aVAnd the land, to depths of tens of meters,
p185
aVis also warming.
p186
aa(lp187
VThe total energy imbalance now
p188
aVis about six-tenths of a watt per square meter.
p189
aVThat may not sound like much,
p190
aVbut when added up over the whole world, it's enormous.
p191
aVIt's about 20 times greater
p192
aVthan the rate of energy use by all of humanity.
p193
aVIt's equivalent to exploding
p194
aV400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day
p195
aV365 days per year.
p196
aVThat's how much extra energy
p197
aVEarth is gaining each day.
p198
aVThis imbalance,
p199
aVif we want to stabilize climate,
p200
aVmeans that we must reduce CO2
p201
aVfrom 391 ppm, parts per million,
p202
aVback to 350 ppm.
p203
aVThat is the change needed to restore energy balance
p204
aVand prevent further warming.
p205
aa(lp206
VClimate change deniers argue
p207
aVthat the Sun is the main cause of climate change.
p208
aVBut the measured energy imbalance occurred
p209
aVduring the deepest solar minimum in the record,
p210
aVwhen the Sun's energy reaching Earth was least.
p211
aVYet, there was more energy coming in than going out.
p212
aVThis shows that the effect of the Sun's variations on climate
p213
aVis overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses,
p214
aVmainly from burning fossil fuels.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow consider Earth's climate history.
p217
aVThese curves for global temperature,
p218
aVatmospheric CO2 and sea level
p219
aVwere derived from ocean cores and Antarctic ice cores,
p220
aVfrom ocean sediments and snowflakes
p221
aVthat piled up year after year
p222
aVover 800,000 years
p223
aVforming a two-mile thick ice sheet.
p224
aVAs you see, there's a high correlation
p225
aVbetween temperature, CO2 and sea level.
p226
aVCareful examination shows
p227
aVthat the temperature changes
p228
aVslightly lead the CO2 changes
p229
aVby a few centuries.
p230
aVClimate change deniers like to use this fact
p231
aVto confuse and trick the public
p232
aVby saying, "Look, the temperature causes CO2 to change,
p233
aVnot vice versa."
p234
aVBut that lag
p235
aVis exactly what is expected.
p236
aa(lp237
VSmall changes in Earth's orbit
p238
aVthat occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years
p239
aValter the distribution
p240
aVof sunlight on Earth.
p241
aVWhen there is more sunlight
p242
aVat high latitudes in summer, ice sheets melt.
p243
aVShrinking ice sheets
p244
aVmake the planet darker,
p245
aVso it absorbs more sunlight
p246
aVand becomes warmer.
p247
aVA warmer ocean releases CO2,
p248
aVjust as a warm Coca-Cola does.
p249
aVAnd more CO2 causes more warming.
p250
aVSo CO2, methane, and ice sheets
p251
aVwere feedbacks
p252
aVthat amplified global temperature change
p253
aVcausing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge,
p254
aVeven though the climate change was initiated
p255
aVby a very weak forcing.
p256
aa(lp257
VThe important point
p258
aVis that these same amplifying feedbacks
p259
aVwill occur today.
p260
aVThe physics does not change.
p261
aVAs Earth warms,
p262
aVnow because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere,
p263
aVice will melt,
p264
aVand CO2 and methane will be released
p265
aVby warming ocean and melting permafrost.
p266
aVWhile we can't say exactly how fast
p267
aVthese amplifying feedbacks will occur,
p268
aVit is certain they will occur,
p269
aVunless we stop the warming.
p270
aVThere is evidence
p271
aVthat feedbacks are already beginning.
p272
aVPrecise measurements
p273
aVby GRACE, the gravity satellite,
p274
aVreveal that both Greenland and Antarctica
p275
aVare now losing mass,
p276
aVseveral hundred cubic kilometers per year.
p277
aVAnd the rate has accelerated
p278
aVsince the measurements began
p279
aVnine years ago.
p280
aVMethane is also beginning
p281
aVto escape from the permafrost.
p282
aa(lp283
VWhat sea level rise
p284
aVcan we look forward to?
p285
aVThe last time CO2 was 390 ppm,
p286
aVtoday's value,
p287
aVsea level was higher
p288
aVby at least 15 meters, 50 feet.
p289
aVWhere you are sitting now
p290
aVwould be under water.
p291
aVMost estimates are that, this century,
p292
aVwe will get at least one meter.
p293
aVI think it will be more
p294
aVif we keep burning fossil fuels,
p295
aVperhaps even five meters, which is 18 feet,
p296
aVthis century or shortly thereafter.
p297
aa(lp298
VThe important point
p299
aVis that we will have started a process
p300
aVthat is out of humanity's control.
p301
aVIce sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries.
p302
aVThere would be no stable shoreline.
p303
aVThe economic consequences are almost unthinkable.
p304
aVHundreds of New Orleans-like devastations
p305
aVaround the world.
p306
aVWhat may be more reprehensible,
p307
aVif climate denial continues,
p308
aVis extermination of species.
p309
aVThe monarch butterfly
p310
aVcould be one of the 20 to 50 percent of all species
p311
aVthat the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates
p312
aVwill be ticketed for extinction
p313
aVby the end of the century
p314
aVif we stay on business-as-usual fossil fuel use.
p315
aa(lp316
VGlobal warming is already affecting people.
p317
aVThe Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico
p318
aVheatwave and drought last year,
p319
aVMoscow the year before
p320
aVand Europe in 2003,
p321
aVwere all exceptional events,
p322
aVmore than three standard deviations outside the norm.
p323
aVFifty years ago,
p324
aVsuch anomalies
p325
aVcovered only two- to three-tenths
p326
aVof one percent of the land area.
p327
aVIn recent years,
p328
aVbecause of global warming,
p329
aVthey now cover about 10 percent \u2014
p330
aVan increase by a factor of 25 to 50.
p331
aVSo we can say with a high degree of confidence
p332
aVthat the severe Texas and Moscow heatwaves
p333
aVwere not natural;
p334
aVthey were caused by global warming.
p335
aVAn important impact,
p336
aVif global warming continues,
p337
aVwill be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world,
p338
aVthe Midwest and Great Plains,
p339
aVwhich are expected to become prone to extreme droughts,
p340
aVworse than the Dust Bowl,
p341
aVwithin just a few decades,
p342
aVif we let global warming continue.
p343
aa(lp344
VHow did I get dragged deeper and deeper
p345
aVinto an attempt to communicate,
p346
aVgiving talks in 10 countries, getting arrested,
p347
aVburning up the vacation time
p348
aVthat I had accumulated over 30 years?
p349
aVMore grandchildren helped me along.
p350
aVJake is a super-positive,
p351
aVenthusiastic boy.
p352
aVHere at age two and a half years,
p353
aVhe thinks he can protect
p354
aVhis two and a half-day-old little sister.
p355
aVIt would be immoral
p356
aVto leave these young people
p357
aVwith a climate system
p358
aVspiraling out of control.
p359
aa(lp360
VNow the tragedy about climate change
p361
aVis that we can solve it
p362
aVwith a simple, honest approach
p363
aVof a gradually rising carbon fee
p364
aVcollected from fossil fuel companies
p365
aVand distributed 100 percent electronically
p366
aVevery month to all legal residents
p367
aVon a per capita basis,
p368
aVwith the government not keeping one dime.
p369
aVMost people would get more in the monthly dividend
p370
aVthan they'd pay in increased prices.
p371
aVThis fee and dividend
p372
aVwould stimulate the economy
p373
aVand innovations,
p374
aVcreating millions of jobs.
p375
aVIt is the principal requirement
p376
aVfor moving us rapidly
p377
aVto a clean energy future.
p378
aa(lp379
VSeveral top economists
p380
aVare coauthors on this proposition.
p381
aVJim DiPeso of Republicans for Environmental Protection
p382
aVdescribes it thusly:
p383
aV"Transparent. Market-based.
p384
aVDoes not enlarge government.
p385
aVLeaves energy decisions to individual choices.
p386
aVSounds like a conservative climate plan."
p387
aa(lp388
VBut instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions
p389
aVto make fossil fuels pay
p390
aVtheir true cost to society,
p391
aVour governments are forcing the public
p392
aVto subsidize fossil fuels
p393
aVby 400 to 500 billion dollars
p394
aVper year worldwide,
p395
aVthus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel \u2014
p396
aVmountaintop removal,
p397
aVlongwall mining, fracking,
p398
aVtar sands, tar shale,
p399
aVdeep ocean Arctic drilling.
p400
aVThis path, if continued,
p401
aVguarantees that we will pass tipping points
p402
aVleading to ice sheet disintegration
p403
aVthat will accelerate out of control of future generations.
p404
aVA large fraction of species
p405
aVwill be committed to extinction.
p406
aVAnd increasing intensity of droughts and floods
p407
aVwill severely impact breadbaskets of the world,
p408
aVcausing massive famines
p409
aVand economic decline.
p410
aVImagine a giant asteroid
p411
aVon a direct collision course with Earth.
p412
aa(lp413
VThat is the equivalent
p414
aVof what we face now.
p415
aVYet, we dither,
p416
aVtaking no action
p417
aVto divert the asteroid,
p418
aVeven though the longer we wait,
p419
aVthe more difficult and expensive it becomes.
p420
aVIf we had started in 2005,
p421
aVit would have required emission reductions of three percent per year
p422
aVto restore planetary energy balance
p423
aVand stabilize climate this century.
p424
aVIf we start next year,
p425
aVit is six percent per year.
p426
aVIf we wait 10 years, it is 15 percent per year \u2014
p427
aVextremely difficult and expensive,
p428
aVperhaps impossible.
p429
aVBut we aren't even starting.
p430
aa(lp431
VSo now you know what I know
p432
aVthat is moving me to sound this alarm.
p433
aVClearly, I haven't gotten this message across.
p434
aVThe science is clear.
p435
aVI need your help
p436
aVto communicate the gravity and the urgency
p437
aVof this situation
