(lp3
VGuys, we have an issue.
p4
aa(lp5
V(Laughter)
p6
aa(lp7
VGrowth is fading away, and it's a big deal.
p8
aVOur global economy stops growing.
p9
aVAnd it's not new.
p10
aVGrowth has actually declined for the last 50 years.
p11
aVIf we continue like this, we need to learn
p12
aVhow to live in a world with no growth in the next decade.
p13
aVThis is scary because when the economy doesn't grow,
p14
aVour children don't get better lives.
p15
aVWhat's even scarier is that when the pie does not grow,
p16
aVeach of us get a smaller piece.
p17
aVWe're then ready to fight for a bigger one.
p18
aVThis creates tensions and serious conflicts.
p19
aVGrowth matters a lot.
p20
aa(lp21
VIf we look at the history of growth,
p22
aVtimes of big growth have always been fueled
p23
aVby big manufacturing revolutions.
p24
aVIt happened three times, every 50-60 years.
p25
aVThe steam engine in the middle of the 19th century,
p26
aVthe mass-production model in the beginning of the 20th century \u2014
p27
aVthanks, Mr. Ford.
p28
aVAnd the first automation wave in the 1970s.
p29
aa(lp30
VWhy did these manufacturing revolutions
p31
aVcreate huge growth in our economies?
p32
aVBecause they have injected huge productivity improvement.
p33
aVIt's rather simple:
p34
aVin order to grow, you need to be producing more,
p35
aVputting more into our economy.
p36
aVThis means either more labor or more capital or more productivity.
p37
aVEach time, productivity has been the growth lever.
p38
aa(lp39
VI'm here today to tell you
p40
aVthat we are on the verge of another huge change,
p41
aVand that this change, surprisingly enough,
p42
aVis going to come from manufacturing, again.
p43
aVIt will get us out of our growth slump
p44
aVand it will change radically the way globalization has been shaped
p45
aVover the last decade.
p46
aVI'm here to tell you about the amazing fourth manufacturing revolution
p47
aVthat is currently underway.
p48
aa(lp49
VIt's not as if we've done nothing with manufacturing
p50
aVsince the last revolution.
p51
aVActually, we've made some pretty lame attempts
p52
aVto try to revitalize it.
p53
aVBut none of them have been the big overhaul
p54
aVwe really need to get us growing again.
p55
aVFor example, we've tried to relocate our factories offshore
p56
aVin order to reduce cost and take advantage of cheap labor.
p57
aVNot only did this not inspire productivity,
p58
aVbut it only saved money for a short period of time,
p59
aVbecause cheap labor didn't stay cheap for long.
p60
aVThen, we've tried to make our factories larger
p61
aVand we specialized them by product.
p62
aVThe idea was that we can make a lot of one product
p63
aVand stockpile it to be sold with demand.
p64
aa(lp65
VThis did help productivity for a while.
p66
aVBut it introduced a lot of rigidities in our supply chain.
p67
aVLet's take fashion retail.
p68
aVTraditional clothing companies
p69
aVhave built offshore, global, rigid supply chains.
p70
aVWhen fast-fashion competitors like Zara
p71
aVstarted replenishing their stocks faster
p72
aVfrom two collections a year to one collection a month,
p73
aVnone of them have been able to keep up with the pace.
p74
aVMost of them are in great difficulties today.
p75
aa(lp76
VYet, with all of their shortcomings,
p77
aVthose are the factories we know today.
p78
aVWhen you open the doors,
p79
aVthey look the same as they did 50 years ago.
p80
aVWe've just changed the location, the size, the way they operate.
p81
aVCan you name anything else that looks the same
p82
aVas it did 50 years ago?
p83
aVIt's crazy.
p84
aVWe've made all the tweaks to the model that we could,
p85
aVand now we hit its limits.
p86
aa(lp87
VAfter all of our attempts to fix the manufacturing model failed,
p88
aVwe thought growth could come from elsewhere.
p89
aVWe turned to the tech sector \u2014
p90
aVthere's been quite a lot of innovations there.
p91
aVJust to name one: the Internet.
p92
aVWe hoped it could produce growth.
p93
aVAnd indeed, it changed our lives.
p94
aVIt made big waves in the media, the service, the entertainment spaces.
p95
aVBut it hasn't done much for productivity.
p96
aVActually, what's surprising is that productivity is on the decline
p97
aVdespite all of those innovation efforts.
p98
aVImagine that \u2014 sitting at work, scrolling through Facebook,
p99
aVwatching videos on YouTube has made us less productive.
p100
aVWeird.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VThis is why we are not growing.
p105
aVWe failed at reinventing the manufacturing space,
p106
aVand large technological innovations have played away from it.
p107
aVBut what if we could combine those forces?
p108
aVWhat if the existing manufacturing and large technological innovation
p109
aVcame together to create the next big manufacturing reinvention.
p110
aa(lp111
VBingo!
p112
aVThis is the fourth manufacturing revolution,
p113
aVand it's happening right now.
p114
aVMajor technologies are entering the manufacturing space,
p115
aVbig time.
p116
aVThey will boost industrial productivity by more than a third.
p117
aVThis is massive, and it will do a lot in creating growth.
p118
aVLet me tell you about some of them.
p119
aa(lp120
VHave you already met advanced manufacturing robots?
p121
aVThey are the size of humans,
p122
aVthey actually collaborate with them,
p123
aVand they can be programmed
p124
aVin order to perform complex, non-repetitive tasks.
p125
aVToday in our factories, only 8 percent of the tasks are automated.
p126
aVThe less complex, the more repetitive ones.
p127
aVIt will be 25 percent in 10 years.
p128
aVIt means that by 2025,
p129
aVadvanced robots will complement workers
p130
aVto be, together, 20 percent more productive,
p131
aVto manufacture 20 percent more outputs,
p132
aVto achieve 20 percent additional growth.
p133
aa(lp134
VThis isn't some fancy, futuristic idea.
p135
aVThese robots are working for us right now.
p136
aVLast year in the US, they helped Amazon prepare and ship all the products
p137
aVrequired for Cyber Monday,
p138
aVthe annual peak of online retail.
p139
aVLast year in the US,
p140
aVit was the biggest online shopping day of the year and of history.
p141
aVConsumers spent 3 billion dollars on electronics that day.
p142
aVThat's real economic growth.
p143
aa(lp144
VThen there's additive manufacturing, 3D printing.
p145
aV3D printing has already improved plastic manufacturing
p146
aVand it's now making its way through metal.
p147
aVThose are not small industries.
p148
aVPlastic and metals represent 25 percent
p149
aVof global manufacturing production.
p150
aa(lp151
VLet's take a real example.
p152
aVIn the aerospace industry,
p153
aVfuel nozzles are some of the most complex parts to manufacture,
p154
aVfor one reason:
p155
aVthey are made up of 20 different parts
p156
aVthat need to be separately produced
p157
aVand then painstakingly assembled.
p158
aVAerospace companies are now using 3D printing,
p159
aVwhich allows them to turn those 20 different parts
p160
aVinto just one.
p161
aVThe results?
p162
aV40 percent more productivity,
p163
aV40 percent more output produced, 40 percent more growth
p164
aVfor this specific industry.
p165
aa(lp166
VBut actually, the most exciting part of this new manufacturing revolution
p167
aVgoes much beyond productivity.
p168
aVIt's about producing better, smarter products.
p169
aVIt's about scale customization.
p170
aVImagine a world where you can buy the exact products you want
p171
aVwith the functionalities you need,
p172
aVwith the design you want,
p173
aVwith the same cost and lead time
p174
aVas a product that's been mass produced,
p175
aVlike your car, or your clothes or your cell phone.
p176
aVThe new manufacturing revolution makes it possible.
p177
aa(lp178
VAdvanced robots can be programmed
p179
aVin order to perform any product configuration
p180
aVwithout any setup time or ramp up.
p181
aV3D printers instantaneously produce any customized design.
p182
aVWe are now able to produce a batch of one product, your product,
p183
aVat the same cost and lead time as a batch of many.
p184
aVThose are only a few examples of the manufacturing revolution at play.
p185
aa(lp186
VNot only will manufacturing become more productive,
p187
aVit will also become more flexible,
p188
aVand those were exactly the elements of growth that we are missing.
p189
aVBut actually, there are even some bigger implications
p190
aVfor all of us when manufacturing will find its way back into the limelight.
p191
aVIt will create a huge macroeconomic shift.
p192
aa(lp193
VFirst, our factories will be relocated into our home markets.
p194
aVIn the world of scale customization,
p195
aVconsumer proximity is the new norm.
p196
aa(lp197
VThen, our factories will be smaller, agile.
p198
aVScale does not matter anymore, flexibility does.
p199
aVThey will be operating on a multi-product, made-to-order basis.
p200
aVThe change will be drastic.
p201
aa(lp202
VGlobalization will enter a new era.
p203
aVThe East-to-West trade flows
p204
aVwill be replaced by regional trade flows.
p205
aVEast for East, West for West.
p206
aVWhen you think about that,
p207
aVthe old model was pretty much insane.
p208
aVPiling up stocks, making products travel the whole world
p209
aVbefore they reach their end consumers.
p210
aVThe new model, producing just next to the consumer market,
p211
aVwill be much cleaner, much better for our environment.
p212
aVIn mature economies, manufacturing will be back home,
p213
aVcreating more employment,
p214
aVmore productivity and more growth.
p215
aVGood news, isn't it?
p216
aa(lp217
VBut here's the thing with growth \u2014
p218
aVit does not come automatically.
p219
aVMature economies will have to seize it.
p220
aVWe'll have to massively re-train our workforce.
p221
aVIn most countries, like in my country, France,
p222
aVwe've told our children that manufacturing had no future.
p223
aVThat it was something happening far away.
p224
aVWe need to reverse that
p225
aVand teach manufacturing again at university.
p226
aVOnly the countries that will boldly transform
p227
aVwill be able to seize this growth.
p228
aa(lp229
VIt's also a chance for developing economies.
p230
aVOf course China and other emerging economies
p231
aVwon't be the factory of the world anymore.
p232
aVActually, it was not a sustainable model in the long term,
p233
aVas those countries are becoming richer.
p234
aVLast year, it was already as expensive to produce in Brazil
p235
aVas to produce in France.
p236
aVBy 2018, manufacturing costs in China will be on par with the US.
p237
aa(lp238
VThe new manufacturing revolution
p239
aVwill accelerate the transition of those emerging economies
p240
aVtowards a model driven by domestic consumption.
p241
aVAnd this is good,
p242
aVbecause this is where growth will be created.
p243
aVIn the next five years,
p244
aVthe next billion consumers in China will inject more growth in our economies
p245
aVthan the top five European markets together.
p246
aa(lp247
VThis fourth manufacturing revolution is a chance for all of us.
p248
aVIf we play it right,
p249
aVwe'll see sustainable growth in all of our economies.
p250
aVThis means more wealth distributed to all of us
p251
aVand a better future for our children.
p252
aa(lp253
VThank you.
