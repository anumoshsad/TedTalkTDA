VI'm a brain scientist, and as a brain scientist,
p4
aVI'm actually interested in how the brain learns,
p5
aVand I'm especially interested in a possibility of
p6
aVmaking our brains smarter, better and faster.
p7
aa(lp8
VThis is in this context I'm going to tell you
p9
aVabout video games. When we say video games,
p10
aVmost of you think about children.
p11
aVIt's true. Ninety percent of children do play video games.
p12
aVBut let's be frank.
p13
aVWhen the kids are in bed, who is in front of the PlayStation?
p14
aVMost of you. The average age of a gamer is 33 years old,
p15
aVnot eight years old, and in fact, if we look
p16
aVat the projected demographics of video game play,
p17
aVthe video game players of tomorrow are
p18
aVolder adults. (Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VSo video [gaming] is pervasive throughout our society.
p21
aVIt is clearly here to stay. It has an amazing impact
p22
aVon our everyday life. Consider these statistics
p23
aVreleased by Activision. After one month of release
p24
aVof the game "Call Of Duty: Black Ops," it had been played
p25
aVfor 68,000 years
p26
aVworldwide, right?
p27
aVWould any of you complain if this was the case
p28
aVabout doing linear algebra?
p29
aa(lp30
VSo what we are asking in the lab is, how can we leverage that power?
p31
aVNow I want to step back a bit.
p32
aVI know most of you have had the experience of coming back
p33
aVhome and finding your kids playing these kinds of games.
p34
aV(Shooting noises) The name of the game is to get
p35
aVafter your enemy zombie bad guys
p36
aVbefore they get to you, right?
p37
aVAnd I'm almost sure most of you have thought,
p38
aV"Oh, come on, can't you do something more intelligent
p39
aVthan shooting at zombies?"
p40
aVI'd like you to put this kind of knee-jerk reaction
p41
aVin the context of what you would have thought
p42
aVif you had found your girl playing sudoku
p43
aVor your boy reading Shakespeare. Right?
p44
aVMost parents would find that great.
p45
aVWell, I'm not going to tell you that playing video games
p46
aVdays in and days out is actually good for your health.
p47
aVIt's not, and binging is never good.
p48
aVBut I'm going to argue that in reasonable doses,
p49
aVactually the very game I showed you at the beginning,
p50
aVthose action-packed shooter games
p51
aVhave quite powerful effects and positive effects
p52
aVon many different aspects of our behavior.
p53
aa(lp54
VThere's not one week that goes without some major
p55
aVheadlines in the media about whether video games are
p56
aVgood or bad for you, right? You're all bombarded with that.
p57
aVI'd like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion aside
p58
aVand get you to actually step into the lab.
p59
aVWhat we do in the lab is actually measure directly,
p60
aVin a quantitative fashion, what is the impact
p61
aVof video games on the brain.
p62
aVAnd so I'm going to take a few examples from our work.
p63
aa(lp64
VOne first saying that I'm sure you all have heard
p65
aVis the fact that too much screen time
p66
aVmakes your eyesight worse.
p67
aVThat's a statement about vision.
p68
aVThere may be vision scientists among you.
p69
aVWe actually know how to test that statement.
p70
aVWe can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is.
p71
aVWell, guess what? People that don't play a lot
p72
aVof action games, that don't actually spend a lot of time
p73
aVin front of screens, have normal, or what we call
p74
aVcorrective-to-normal vision. That's okay.
p75
aVThe issue is what happens with these guys that actually
p76
aVindulge into playing video games like five hours per week,
p77
aV10 hours per week, 15 hours per week.
p78
aVBy that statement, their vision should be really bad, right?
p79
aVGuess what? Their vision is really, really good.
p80
aVIt's better than those that don't play.
p81
aVAnd it's better in two different ways.
p82
aVThe first way is that they're actually able to resolve
p83
aVsmall detail in the context of clutter, and though that means
p84
aVbeing able to read the fine print on a prescription
p85
aVrather than using magnifier glasses, you can actually do it
p86
aVwith just your eyesight.
p87
aVThe other way that they are better is actually being able
p88
aVto resolve different levels of gray.
p89
aVImagine you're driving in a fog. That makes a difference
p90
aVbetween seeing the car in front of you
p91
aVand avoiding the accident, or getting into an accident.
p92
aVSo we're actually leveraging that work to develop games
p93
aVfor patients with low vision, and to have an impact
p94
aVon retraining their brain to see better.
p95
aVClearly, when it comes to action video games,
p96
aVscreen time doesn't make your eyesight worse.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnother saying that I'm sure you have all heard around:
p99
aVVideo games lead to attention problems and greater distractability.
p100
aVOkay, we know how to measure attention in the lab.
p101
aVI'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so.
p102
aVI'm going to ask you to participate, so you're going to have
p103
aVto actually play the game with me. I'm going to show you
p104
aVcolored words. I want you to shout out the color of the ink.
p105
aVRight? So this is the first example.
p106
aV["Chair"]
p107
aVOrange, good. ["Table"] Green.
p108
aV["Board"] Audience: Red.Daphne Bavelier: Red.
p109
aV["Horse"] DB: Yellow. Audience: Yellow.
p110
aV["Yellow"] DB: Red. Audience: Yellow.
p111
aV["Blue"] DB: Yellow.
p112
aVOkay, you get my point, right? (Laughter)
p113
aVYou're getting better, but it's hard. Why is it hard?
p114
aVBecause I introduced a conflict between
p115
aVthe word itself and its color.
p116
aVHow good your attention is determines actually how fast
p117
aVyou resolve that conflict, so the young guys here
p118
aVat the top of their game probably, like, did a little better
p119
aVthan some of us that are older.
p120
aVWhat we can show is that when you do this kind of task
p121
aVwith people that play a lot of action games,
p122
aVthey actually resolve the conflict faster.
p123
aVSo clearly playing those action games doesn't lead
p124
aVto attention problems.
p125
aa(lp126
VActually, those action video game players have
p127
aVmany other advantages in terms of attention, and one
p128
aVaspect of attention which is also improved for the better
p129
aVis our ability to track objects around in the world.
p130
aVThis is something we use all the time. When you're driving,
p131
aVyou're tracking, keeping track of the cars around you.
p132
aVYou're also keeping track of the pedestrian, the running dog,
p133
aVand that's how you can actually be safe driving, right?
p134
aa(lp135
VIn the lab, we get people to come to the lab,
p136
aVsit in front of a computer screen, and we give them
p137
aVlittle tasks that I'm going to get you to do again.
p138
aVYou're going to see yellow happy faces
p139
aVand a few sad blue faces. These are children
p140
aVin the schoolyard in Geneva during a recess
p141
aVduring the winter. Most kids are happy. It's actually recess.
p142
aVBut a few kids are sad and blue because they've forgotten their coat.
p143
aVEverybody begins to move around, and your task
p144
aVis to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning
p145
aVand who didn't. So I'm just going to show you an example
p146
aVwhere there is only one sad kid. It's easy because you can
p147
aVactually track it with your eyes. You can track,
p148
aVyou can track, and then when it stops, and there is
p149
aVa question mark, and I ask you, did this kid have a coat or not?
p150
aVWas it yellow initially or blue?
p151
aVI hear a few yellow. Good. So most of you have a brain. (Laughter)
p152
aVI'm now going to ask you to do the task, but now with
p153
aVa little more challenging task. There are going to be
p154
aVthree of them that are blue. Don't move your eyes.
p155
aVPlease don't move your eyes. Keep your eyes fixated
p156
aVand expand, pull your attention. That's the only way
p157
aVyou can actually do it. If you move your eyes, you're doomed.
p158
aVYellow or blue?
p159
aVAudience: Yellow.DB: Good.
p160
aVSo your typical normal young adult
p161
aVcan have a span of about three or four objects of attention.
p162
aVThat's what we just did. Your action video game player
p163
aVhas a span of about six to seven objects of attention,
p164
aVwhich is what is shown in this video here.
p165
aVThat's for you guys, action video game players.
p166
aVA bit more challenging, right? (Laughter)
p167
aVYellow or blue? Blue. We have some people
p168
aVthat are serious out there. Yeah. (Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VGood. So in the same way that we actually see
p171
aVthe effects of video games on people's behavior,
p172
aVwe can use brain imaging and look at the impact
p173
aVof video games on the brain, and we do find many changes,
p174
aVbut the main changes are actually to the brain networks
p175
aVthat control attention. So one part is the parietal cortex
p176
aVwhich is very well known to control the orientation of attention.
p177
aVThe other one is the frontal lobe, which controls
p178
aVhow we sustain attention, and another one
p179
aVis the anterior cingulate, which controls how we allocate
p180
aVand regulate attention and resolve conflict.
p181
aVNow, when we do brain imaging, we find that all three
p182
aVof these networks are actually much more efficient
p183
aVin people that play action games.
p184
aa(lp185
VThis actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding
p186
aVin the literature about technology and the brain.
p187
aVYou all know about multitasking. You all have been faulty
p188
aVof multitasking when you're driving
p189
aVand you pick up your cellphone. Bad idea. Very bad idea.
p190
aVWhy? Because as your attention shifts to your cell phone,
p191
aVyou are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly
p192
aVto the car braking in front of you, and so you're
p193
aVmuch more likely to get engaged into a car accident.
p194
aVNow, we can measure that kind of skills in the lab.
p195
aVWe obviously don't ask people to drive around and see
p196
aVhow many car accidents they have. That would be a little
p197
aVcostly proposition. But we design tasks on the computer
p198
aVwhere we can measure, to millisecond accuracy,
p199
aVhow good they are at switching from one task to another.
p200
aVWhen we do that, we actually find that people
p201
aVthat play a lot of action games are really, really good.
p202
aVThey switch really fast, very swiftly. They pay a very small cost.
p203
aa(lp204
VNow I'd like you to remember that result, and put it
p205
aVin the context of another group of technology users,
p206
aVa group which is actually much revered by society,
p207
aVwhich are people that engage in multimedia-tasking.
p208
aVWhat is multimedia-tasking? It's the fact that most of us,
p209
aVmost of our children, are engaged with listening to music
p210
aVat the same time as they're doing search on the web
p211
aVat the same time as they're chatting on Facebook with their friends.
p212
aVThat's a multimedia-tasker.
p213
aVThere was a first study done by colleagues at Stanford
p214
aVand that we replicated that showed that
p215
aVthose people that identify as being high multimedia-taskers
p216
aVare absolutely abysmal at multitasking.
p217
aVWhen we measure them in the lab, they're really bad.
p218
aa(lp219
VRight? So these kinds of results really
p220
aVmakes two main points.
p221
aVThe first one is that not all media are created equal.
p222
aVYou can't compare the effect of multimedia-tasking
p223
aVand the effect of playing action games. They have
p224
aVtotally different effects on different aspects of cognition,
p225
aVperception and attention.
p226
aVEven within video games, I'm telling you right now
p227
aVabout these action-packed video games.
p228
aVDifferent video games have a different effect on your brains.
p229
aVSo we actually need to step into the lab and really measure
p230
aVwhat is the effect of each video game.
p231
aa(lp232
VThe other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight.
p233
aVI showed that to you already, like we looked at the fact that
p234
aVdespite a lot of screen time, those action gamers
p235
aVhave a lot of very good vision, etc.
p236
aVHere, what was really striking is that these undergraduates
p237
aVthat actually report engaging in a lot of high
p238
aVmultimedia-tasking are convinced they aced the test.
p239
aVSo you show them their data, you show them they are bad
p240
aVand they're like, "Not possible." You know, they have
p241
aVthis sort of gut feeling that, really, they are doing really, really good.
p242
aVThat's another argument for why we need to step into the lab
p243
aVand really measure the impact of technology on the brain.
p244
aa(lp245
VNow in a sense, when we think about the effect
p246
aVof video games on the brain, it's very similar
p247
aVto the effect of wine on the health.
p248
aVThere are some very poor uses of wine. There are some
p249
aVvery poor uses of video games. But when consumed
p250
aVin reasonable doses, and at the right age,
p251
aVwine can be very good for health. There are actually
p252
aVspecific molecules that have been identified
p253
aVin red wine as leading to greater life expectancy.
p254
aVSo it's the same way, like those action video games
p255
aVhave a number of ingredients that are actually really
p256
aVpowerful for brain plasticity, learning, attention,
p257
aVvision, etc., and so we need and we're working on
p258
aVunderstanding what are those active ingredients so that
p259
aVwe can really then leverage them to deliver better games,
p260
aVeither for education or for rehabilitation of patients.
p261
aa(lp262
VNow because we are interested in having an impact
p263
aVfor education or rehabilitation of patients, we are actually
p264
aVnot that interested in how those of you that choose
p265
aVto play video games for many hours on end perform.
p266
aVI'm much more interested in taking any of you
p267
aVand showing that by forcing you to play an action game,
p268
aVI can actually change your vision for the better,
p269
aVwhether you want to play that action game or not, right?
p270
aVThat's the point of rehabilitation or education.
p271
aVMost of the kids don't go to school saying,
p272
aV"Great, two hours of math!"
p273
aa(lp274
VSo that's really the crux of the research, and to do that,
p275
aVwe need to go one more step.
p276
aVAnd one more step is to do training studies.
p277
aVSo let me illustrate that step with
p278
aVa task which is called mental rotation.
p279
aVMental rotation is a task where I'm going to ask you,
p280
aVand again you're going to do the task,
p281
aVto look at this shape. Study it, it's a target shape,
p282
aVand I'm going to present to you four different shapes.
p283
aVOne of these four different shapes is actually a rotated
p284
aVversion of this shape. I want you to tell me which one:
p285
aVthe first one, second one, third one or fourth one?
p286
aVOkay, I'll help you. Fourth one.
p287
aVOne more. Get those brains working. Come on.
p288
aVThat's our target shape.
p289
aVThird. Good! This is hard, right?
p290
aVLike, the reason that I asked you to do that is because
p291
aVyou really feel your brain cringing, right?
p292
aVIt doesn't really feel like playing mindless action video games.
p293
aa(lp294
VWell, what we do in these training studies is, people
p295
aVcome to the lab, they do tasks like this one,
p296
aVwe then force them to play 10 hours of action games.
p297
aVThey don't play 10 hours of action games in a row.
p298
aVThey do distributed practice, so little shots of 40 minutes
p299
aVseveral days over a period of two weeks.
p300
aVThen, once they are done with the training, they come back
p301
aVa few days later and they are tested again on a similar type
p302
aVof mental rotation task. So this is work from a colleague
p303
aVin Toronto. What they showed is that, initially,
p304
aVyou know, subjects perform where they are expected
p305
aVto perform given their age. After two weeks of training
p306
aVon action video games, they actually perform better,
p307
aVand the improvement is still there five months after
p308
aVhaving done the training. That's really, really important.
p309
aVWhy? Because I told you we want to use these games
p310
aVfor education or for rehabilitation. We need to have effects
p311
aVthat are going to be long-lasting.
p312
aa(lp313
VNow, at this point, a number of you are probably wondering
p314
aVwell, what are you waiting for, to put on the market
p315
aVa game that would be good for the attention
p316
aVof my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy,
p317
aVor a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision
p318
aVof my grandson who has amblyopia, for example?
p319
aa(lp320
VWell, we're working on it, but here is a challenge.
p321
aVThere are brain scientists like me that are beginning
p322
aVto understand what are the good ingredients in games
p323
aVto promote positive effects, and that's what I'm going
p324
aVto call the broccoli side of the equation.
p325
aVThere is an entertainment software industry
p326
aVwhich is extremely deft at coming up with
p327
aVappealing products that you can't resist.
p328
aVThat's the chocolate side of the equation.
p329
aVThe issue is we need to put the two together,
p330
aVand it's a little bit like with food.
p331
aVWho really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli?
p332
aVNone of you. (Laughter) And you probably have had
p333
aVthat feeling, right, picking up an education game
p334
aVand sort of feeling, hmm, you know, it's not really fun,
p335
aVit's not really engaging. So what we need
p336
aVis really a new brand of chocolate, a brand of chocolate
p337
aVthat is irresistible, that you really want to play,
p338
aVbut that has all the ingredients, the good ingredients
p339
aVthat are extracted from the broccoli that you can't recognize
p340
aVbut are still working on your brains. And we're working on it,
p341
aVbut it takes brain scientists to come and to get together,
p342
aVpeople that work in the entertainment software industry,
p343
aVand publishers, so these are not people that usually
p344
aVmeet every day, but it's actually doable,
p345
aVand we are on the right track.
p346
aVI'd like to leave you with that thought,
p347
aVand thank you for your attention. (Applause)
