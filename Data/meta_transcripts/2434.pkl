VAs a kid, I used to dream about the ocean.
p4
aVIt was this wild place full of color and life,
p5
aVhome to these alien-looking, fantastical creatures.
p6
aVI pictured big sharks ruling the food chain
p7
aVand saw graceful sea turtles dancing across coral reefs.
p8
aa(lp9
VAs a marine biologist turned photographer,
p10
aVI've spent most of my career looking for places
p11
aVas magical as those I used to dream about when I was little.
p12
aVAs you can see,
p13
aVI began exploring bodies of water at a fairly young age.
p14
aVBut the first time I truly went underwater,
p15
aVI was about 10 years old.
p16
aVAnd I can still vividly remember furiously finning
p17
aVto reach this old, encrusted cannon on a shallow coral reef.
p18
aVAnd when I finally managed to grab hold of it,
p19
aVI looked up, and I was instantly surrounded by fish
p20
aVin all colors of the rainbow.
p21
aVThat was the day I fell in love with the ocean.

VIn my 40 years on this planet,
p28
aVI've had the great privilege to explore
p29
aVsome of its most incredible seascapes
p30
aVfor National Geographic Magazine
p31
aVand the Save Our Seas Foundation.
p32
aVI've photographed everything from really, really big sharks
p33
aVto dainty ones that fit in the palm of your hand.
p34
aVI've smelled the fishy, fishy breath of humpback whales
p35
aVfeeding just feet away from me
p36
aVin the cold seas off Canada's Great Bear Rainforest.
p37
aVAnd I've been privy to the mating rituals of green sea turtles
p38
aVin the Mozambique Channel.
p39
aa(lp40
VEveryone on this planet affects and is affected by the ocean.
p41
aVAnd the pristine seas I used to dream of as a child
p42
aVare becoming harder and harder to find.
p43
aVThey are becoming more compressed
p44
aVand more threatened.
p45
aVAs we humans continue to maintain our role
p46
aVas the leading predator on earth,
p47
aVI've witnessed and photographed many of these ripple effects firsthand.
p48
aVFor a long time, I thought I had to shock my audience
p49
aVout of their indifference with disturbing images.
p50
aVAnd while this approach has merits,
p51
aVI have come full circle.
p52
aVI believe that the best way for me to effect change
p53
aVis to sell love.
p54
aVI guess I'm a matchmaker of sorts
p55
aVand as a photographer,
p56
aVI have the rare opportunity
p57
aVto reveal animals and entire ecosystems
p58
aVthat lie hidden beneath the ocean's surface.
p59
aVYou can't love something and become a champion for it
p60
aVif you don't know it exists.
p61
aVUncovering this \u2014 that is the power of conservation photography.

aa(lp65
VI've visited hundreds of marine locations,
p66
aVbut there are a handful of seascapes
p67
aVthat have touched me incredibly deeply.
p68
aVThe first time I experienced that kind of high
p69
aVwas about 10 years ago,
p70
aVoff South Africa's rugged, wild coast.
p71
aVAnd every June and July,
p72
aVenormous shoals of sardines travel northwards
p73
aVin a mass migration we call the Sardine Run.
p74
aVAnd boy, do those fish have good reason to run.
p75
aVIn hot pursuit are hoards of hungry and agile predators.
p76
aVCommon dolphins hunt together
p77
aVand they can separate some of the sardines from the main shoal
p78
aVand they create bait balls.
p79
aVThey drive and trap the fish upward against the ocean surface
p80
aVand then they rush in to dine
p81
aVon this pulsating and movable feast.
p82
aVClose behind are sharks.
p83
aVNow, most people believe
p84
aVthat sharks and dolphins are these mortal enemies,
p85
aVbut during the Sardine Run, they actually coexist.
p86
aVIn fact, dolphins actually help sharks feed more effectively.
p87
aVWithout dolphins, the bait balls are more dispersed
p88
aVand sharks often end up with what I call a sardine donut,
p89
aVor a mouth full of water.
p90
aVNow, while I've had a few spicy moments with sharks on the sardine run,
p91
aVI know they don't see me as prey.
p92
aVHowever, I get bumped and tail-slapped just like any other guest
p93
aVat this rowdy, rowdy banquet.
p94
aa(lp95
VFrom the shores of Africa we travel east,
p96
aVacross the vastness that is the Indian Ocean
p97
aVto the Maldives, an archipelago of coral islands.
p98
aVAnd during the stormy southwest monsoon,
p99
aVmanta rays from all across the archipelago
p100
aVtravel to a tiny speck in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.
p101
aVArmies of crustaceans,
p102
aVmost no bigger than the size of your pupils,
p103
aVare the mainstay of the manta ray's diet.
p104
aVWhen plankton concentrations become patchy,
p105
aVmanta rays feed alone
p106
aVand they somersault themselves backwards again and again,
p107
aVvery much like a puppy chasing its own tail.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Music)
p110
aa(lp111
VHowever, when plankton densities increase,
p112
aVthe mantas line up head-to-tail to form these long feeding chains,
p113
aVand any tasty morsel that escapes the first or second manta in line
p114
aVis surely to be gobbled up by the next or the one after.
p115
aVAs plankton levels peak in the bay,
p116
aVthe mantas swim closer and closer together
p117
aVin a unique behavior we call cyclone feeding.
p118
aVAnd as they swirl in tight formation,
p119
aVthis multi-step column of mantas
p120
aVcreates its own vortex, sucking in and delivering the plankton
p121
aVright into the mantas' cavernous mouths.
p122
aVThe experience of diving amongst such masses of hundreds of rays
p123
aVis truly unforgettable.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Music)
p126
aa(lp127
VWhen I first photographed Hanifaru,
p128
aVthe site enjoyed no protection
p129
aVand was threatened by development.
p130
aVAnd working with NGOs like the Manta Trust,
p131
aVmy images eventually helped Hanifaru
p132
aVbecome a marine-protected area.
p133
aVNow, fisherman from neighboring islands,
p134
aVthey once hunted these manta rays
p135
aVto make traditional drums from their skins.
p136
aVToday, they are the most ardent conservation champions
p137
aVand manta rays earn the Maldivian economy
p138
aVin excess of 8 million dollars every single year.
p139
aa(lp140
VI have always wanted to travel back in time
p141
aVto an era where maps were mostly blank
p142
aVor they read, "There be dragons."
p143
aVAnd today, the closest I've come is visiting remote atolls
p144
aVin the western Indian Ocean.
p145
aVFar, far away from shipping lanes and fishing fleets,
p146
aVdiving into these waters is a poignant reminder
p147
aVof what our oceans once looked like.
p148
aa(lp149
VVery few people have heard of Bassas da India,
p150
aVa tiny speck of coral in the Mozambique Channel.
p151
aVIts reef forms a protective outer barrier
p152
aVand the inner lagoon is a nursery ground
p153
aVfor Galapagos sharks.
p154
aVThese sharks are anything but shy, even during the day.
p155
aVI had a bit of a hunch that they'd be even bolder
p156
aVand more abundant at night.
p157
aa(lp158
V(Music)
p159
aa(lp160
VNever before have I encountered
p161
aVso many sharks on a single coral outcrop.
p162
aVCapturing and sharing moments like this \u2014
p163
aVthat reminds me why I chose my path.
p164
aa(lp165
VEarlier this year, I was on assignment for National Geographic Magazine
p166
aVin Baja California.
p167
aVAnd about halfway down the peninsula on the Pacific side
p168
aVlies San Ignacio Lagoon,
p169
aVa critical calving ground for gray whales.
p170
aVFor 100 years, this coast was the scene of a wholesale slaughter,
p171
aVwhere more than 20,000 gray whales were killed,
p172
aVleaving only a few hundred survivors.
p173
aVToday the descendents of these same whales
p174
aVnudge their youngsters to the surface
p175
aVto play and even interact with us.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Music)
p178
aa(lp179
VThis species truly has made a remarkable comeback.
p180
aa(lp181
VNow, on the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo,
p182
aVa sleepy fishing village.
p183
aVDecades of overfishing had brought them close to collapse.
p184
aVIn 1995, local fisherman convinced the authorities
p185
aVto proclaim their waters a marine reserve.
p186
aVBut what happened next was nothing short of miraculous.
p187
aVIn 2005, after only a single decade of protection,
p188
aVscientists measured the largest recovery of fish ever recorded.
p189
aa(lp190
VBut don't take my word for it \u2014 come with me.
p191
aVOn a single breath, swim with me in deep,
p192
aVinto one of the largest and densest schools of fish
p193
aVI have ever encountered.
p194
aa(lp195
V(Music)
p196
aa(lp197
VWe all have the ability to be creators of hope.
p198
aVAnd through my photography,
p199
aVI want to pass on the message that it is not too late for our oceans.
p200
aVAnd particularly, I want to focus on nature's resilience
p201
aVin the face of 7.3 billion people.
p202
aa(lp203
VMy hope is that in the future,
p204
aVI will have to search much, much harder
p205
aVto make photographs like this,
p206
aVwhile creating images that showcase
p207
aVour respectful coexistence with the ocean.
p208
aVThose will hopefully become an everyday occurrence for me.
p209
aa(lp210
VTo thrive and survive in my profession,
p211
aVyou really have to be a hopeless optimist.
p212
aVAnd I always operate on the assumption
p213
aVthat the next great picture that will effect change
p214
aVis right around the corner,
p215
aVbehind the next coral head,
p216
aVinside the next lagoon
p217
aVor possibly, in the one after it.
