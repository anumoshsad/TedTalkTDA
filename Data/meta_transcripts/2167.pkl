VWhen you grow up in a developing country like India, as I did,
p4
aVyou instantly learn to get more value from limited resources
p5
aVand find creative ways to reuse what you already have.
p6
aVTake Mansukh Prajapati, a potter in India.
p7
aVHe has created a fridge made entirely of clay
p8
aVthat consumes no electricity.
p9
aVHe can keep fruits and vegetables fresh for many days.
p10
aVThat's a cool invention, literally.
p11
aVIn Africa, if you run out of your cell phone battery, don't panic.
p12
aVYou will find some resourceful entrepreneurs
p13
aVwho can recharge your  cell phone using bicycles.
p14
aVAnd since we are in South America,
p15
aVlet's go to Lima in Peru,
p16
aVa region with high humidity
p17
aVthat receives only one inch of rainfall each year.
p18
aVAn engineering college in Lima designed a giant advertising billboard
p19
aVthat absorbs air humidity and converts it into purified water,
p20
aVgenerating over 90 liters of water every day.
p21
aVThe Peruvians are amazing.
p22
aVThey can literally create water out of thin air.
p23
aa(lp24
VFor the past seven years,
p25
aVI have met and studied hundreds of entrepreneurs
p26
aVin India, China, Africa and South America, and they keep amazing me.
p27
aVMany of them did not go to school.
p28
aVThey don't invent stuff in big R&D labs.
p29
aVThe street is the lab.
p30
aVWhy do they do that?
p31
aVBecause they don't have the kind of basic resources we take for granted,
p32
aVlike capital and energy,
p33
aVand basic services like healthcare and education
p34
aVare also scarce in those regions.
p35
aVWhen external resources are scarce, you have to go within yourself
p36
aVto tap the most abundant resource, human ingenuity,
p37
aVand use that ingenuity to find clever ways to solve problems with limited resources.
p38
aa(lp39
VIn India, we call it Jugaad.
p40
aVJugaad is a Hindi word
p41
aVthat means an improvised fix, a clever solution born in adversity.
p42
aVJugaad solutions are not sophisticated or perfect,
p43
aVbut they create more value at lower cost.
p44
aVFor me, the entrepreneurs who will create Jugaad solutions
p45
aVare like alchemists.
p46
aVThey can magically transform adversity into opportunity,
p47
aVand turn something of less value into something of high value.
p48
aVIn other words, they mastered the art of doing more with less,
p49
aVwhich is the essence of frugal innovation.
p50
aa(lp51
VFrugal innovation is the ability  to create more economic and social value
p52
aVusing fewer resources.
p53
aVFrugal innovation is not about making do; it's about making things better.
p54
aVNow I want to show you how, across emerging markets,
p55
aVentrepreneurs and companies are adopting  frugal innovation on a larger scale
p56
aVto cost-effectively deliver healthcare and energy to billions of people
p57
aVwho may have little income but very high aspirations.
p58
aa(lp59
VLet's first go to China,
p60
aVwhere the country's largest I.T. service provider, Neusoft,
p61
aVhas developed a telemedicine solution
p62
aVto help doctors in cities remotely treat old and poor patients
p63
aVin Chinese villages.
p64
aVThis solution is based on simple-to-use medical devices
p65
aVthat less qualified health workers like nurses can use in rural clinics.
p66
aVChina desperately needs these frugal medical solutions
p67
aVbecause by 2050 it will be home to over half a billion senior citizens.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow let's go to Kenya,
p70
aVa country where half the population uses M-Pesa, a mobile payment solution.
p71
aVThis is a great solution for the African continent
p72
aVbecause 80 percent of Africans don't have a bank account,
p73
aVbut what is exciting is that M-Pesa is now becoming the source
p74
aVof other disruptive business models in sectors like energy.
p75
aVTake M-KOPA, the home solar solution that comes literally in a box
p76
aVthat has a solar rooftop panel, three LED lights,
p77
aVa solar radio, and a cell phone charger.
p78
aVThe whole kit, though, costs 200 dollars, which is too expensive for most Kenyans,
p79
aVand this is where mobile telephony can make the solution more affordable.
p80
aVToday, you can buy this kit by making an initial deposit of just 35 dollars,
p81
aVand then pay off the rest by making a daily micro-payment of 45 cents
p82
aVusing your mobile phone.
p83
aVOnce you've made 365 micro-payments, the system is unlocked,
p84
aVand you own the product and you start  receiving clean, free electricity.
p85
aVThis is an amazing solution for Kenya,
p86
aVwhere 70 percent of people live off the grid.
p87
aVThis shows that with frugal innovation
p88
aVwhat matters is that you take what is most abundant, mobile connectivity,
p89
aVto deal with what is scarce, which is energy.
p90
aa(lp91
VWith frugal innovation, the global South is actually catching up
p92
aVand in some cases  even leap-frogging the North.
p93
aVInstead of building expensive hospitals, China is using telemedicine
p94
aVto cost-effectively treat millions of patients,
p95
aVand Africa, instead of building banks and electricity grids,
p96
aVis going straight to mobile payments and distributed clean energy.
p97
aa(lp98
VFrugal innovation is diametrically opposed to the way we innovate in the North.
p99
aVI live in Silicon Valley,
p100
aVwhere we keep chasing the next big technology thing.
p101
aVThink of the iPhone 5, 6, then 7, 8.
p102
aVCompanies in the West spend billions of dollars investing in R&D,
p103
aVand use tons of natural resources to create ever more complex products,
p104
aVto differentiate their brands from competition,
p105
aVand they charge customers more money for new features.
p106
aVSo the conventional business model  in the West is more for more.
p107
aVBut sadly, this more for more model is running out of gas, for three reasons:
p108
aVFirst, a big portion of customers in the West
p109
aVbecause of the diminishing purchasing power,
p110
aVcan no longer afford these expensive products.
p111
aVSecond, we are running out of natural water and oil.
p112
aVIn California, where I live, water scarcity is becoming a big problem.
p113
aVAnd third, most importantly,
p114
aVbecause of the growing income disparity
p115
aVbetween the rich  and the middle class in the West,
p116
aVthere is a big disconnect between existing products and services
p117
aVand basic needs of customers.
p118
aVDo you know that today,
p119
aVthere are over 70 million Americans today who are underbanked,
p120
aVbecause existing banking services
p121
aVare not designed to address their basic needs.
p122
aa(lp123
VThe prolonged economic crisis in the West is making people think
p124
aVthat they are about to lose the high standard of living
p125
aVand face deprivation.
p126
aVI believe that the only way we can sustain growth and prosperity in the West
p127
aVis if we learn to do more with less.
p128
aa(lp129
VThe good news is, that's starting to happen.
p130
aVSeveral Western companies are now adopting frugal innovation
p131
aVto create affordable products for Western consumers.
p132
aVLet me give you two examples.
p133
aa(lp134
VWhen I first saw this building,
p135
aVI told myself it's some kind of postmodern house.
p136
aVActually, it's a small manufacturing plant set up by Grameen Danone,
p137
aVa joint venture between  Grameen Bank of Muhammad Yunus
p138
aVand the food multinational Danone
p139
aVto make high-quality yogurt in Bangladesh.
p140
aVThis factory is 10 percent the size of existing Danone factories
p141
aVand cost much less to build.
p142
aVI guess you can call it a low-fat factory.
p143
aVNow this factory, unlike Western factories that are highly automated,
p144
aVrelies a lot on manual processes in order  to generate jobs for local communities.
p145
aVDanone was so inspired by this model
p146
aVthat combines economic efficiency and social sustainability,
p147
aVthey are planning to roll it out in other parts of the world as well.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow, when you see this example,
p150
aVyou might be thinking, "Well, frugal innovation is low tech."
p151
aVActually, no.
p152
aVFrugal innovation is also about making high tech
p153
aVmore affordable and more accessible to more people.
p154
aVLet me give you an example.
p155
aa(lp156
VIn China, the R&D engineers of Siemens Healthcare
p157
aVhave designed a C.T. scanner that is easy enough to be used
p158
aVby less qualified health workers, like nurses and technicians.
p159
aVThis device can scan more patients on a daily basis,
p160
aVand yet consumes less energy,
p161
aVwhich is great for hospitals, but it's also great for patients
p162
aVbecause it reduces the cost of treatment by 30 percent
p163
aVand radiation dosage by up to 60 percent.
p164
aVThis solution was initially designed for the Chinese market,
p165
aVbut now it's selling like hotcakes in the U.S. and Europe,
p166
aVwhere hospitals are pressured to deliver quality care at lower cost.
p167
aa(lp168
VBut the frugal innovation revolution
p169
aVin the West is actually led by creative entrepreneurs
p170
aVwho are coming up with amazing solutions
p171
aVto address basic needs in the U.S. and Europe.
p172
aVLet me quickly give you three examples of startups
p173
aVthat personally inspire me.
p174
aVThe first one happens to be launched by my neighbor in Silicon Valley.
p175
aVIt's called gThrive.
p176
aVThey make these wireless sensors designed like plastic rulers
p177
aVthat farmers can stick in different parts of the field
p178
aVand start collecting detailed information like soil conditions.
p179
aVThis dynamic data allows farmers to optimize use of water energy
p180
aVwhile improving quality of the products and the yields,
p181
aVwhich is a great solution for California, which faces major water shortage.
p182
aVIt pays for itself within one year.
p183
aa(lp184
VSecond example is Be-Bound, also in Silicon Valley,
p185
aVthat enables you to connect to the Internet
p186
aVeven in no-bandwidth areas where there's no wi-fi or 3G or 4G.
p187
aVHow do they do that?
p188
aVThey simply use SMS, a basic technology, but that happens to be the most reliable
p189
aVand most widely available around the world.
p190
aVThree billion people today with  cell phones can't access the Internet.
p191
aVThis solution can connect them to the Internet in a frugal way.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd in France, there is a startup calle Compte Nickel,
p194
aVwhich is revolutionizing the banking sector.
p195
aVIt allows thousands of people to walk into a Mom and Pop store
p196
aVand in just five minutes activate the service that gives them two products:
p197
aVan international bank account number and an international debit card.
p198
aVThey charge a flat annual  maintenance fee of just 20 Euros.
p199
aVThat means you can do all banking transactions \u2014
p200
aVsend and receive money, pay with your debit card \u2014
p201
aVall with no additional charge.
p202
aVThis is what I call low-cost banking without the bank.
p203
aVAmazingly, 75 percent of the customers using this service
p204
aVare the middle-class French who can't afford high banking fees.
p205
aa(lp206
VNow, I talked about frugal innovation, initially pioneered in the South,
p207
aVnow being adopted in the North.
p208
aVUltimately, we would like to see
p209
aVdeveloped countries and developing countries
p210
aVcome together and co-create frugal solutions
p211
aVthat benefit the entire humanity.
p212
aVThe exciting news is that's starting to happen.
p213
aVLet's go to Nairobi to find that out.
p214
aa(lp215
VNairobi has horrendous traffic jams.
p216
aVWhen I first saw them, I thought, "Holy cow."
p217
aVLiterally, because you have to dodge cows as well when you drive in Nairobi.
p218
aVTo ease the situation,
p219
aVthe engineers at the IBM lab in Kenya are piloting a solution called Megaffic,
p220
aVwhich initially was designed by the Japanese engineers.
p221
aVUnlike in the West, Megaffic doesn't rely on roadside sensors,
p222
aVwhich are very expensive to install in Nairobi.
p223
aVInstead they process images, traffic data,
p224
aVcollected from a small number of low-resolution webcams in Nairobi streets,
p225
aVand then they use analytic software to predict congestion points,
p226
aVand they can SMS drivers alternate routes to take.
p227
aVGranted, Megaffic is not as sexy as self-driving cars,
p228
aVbut it promises to take Nairobi drivers from point A to point B
p229
aVat least 20 percent faster.
p230
aVAnd earlier this year, UCLA Health launched its Global Lab for Innovation,
p231
aVwhich seeks to identify frugal healthcare  solutions anywhere in the world
p232
aVthat will be at least 20 percent cheaper than existing solutions in the U.S.
p233
aVand yet more effective.
p234
aVIt also tries to bring together innovators from North and South
p235
aVto cocreate affordable healthcare solutions for all of humanity.
p236
aa(lp237
VI gave tons of examples of frugal innovators from around the world,
p238
aVbut the question is, how do you go about adopting frugal innovation?
p239
aVWell, I gleaned out three principles from frugal innovators around the world
p240
aVthat I want to share with you
p241
aVthat you can apply in your own organization
p242
aVto do more with less.
p243
aa(lp244
VThe first principle is: Keep it simple.
p245
aVDon't create solutions to impress customers.
p246
aVMake them easy enough to use and widely accessible,
p247
aVlike the C.T. scanner we saw in China.
p248
aa(lp249
VSecond principle:  Do not reinvent the wheel.
p250
aVTry to leverage existing resources and assets that are widely available,
p251
aVlike using mobile telephony to offer clean energy
p252
aVor Mom and Pop stores to offer banking services.
p253
aa(lp254
VThird principle is: Think and act horizontally.
p255
aVCompanies tend to scale up vertically
p256
aVby centralizing operations in big factories and warehouses,
p257
aVbut if you want to be agile and deal with immense customer diversity,
p258
aVyou need to scale out horizontally using a distributed supply chain
p259
aVwith smaller manufacturing and distribution units,
p260
aVlike Grameen Bank has shown.
p261
aa(lp262
VThe South pioneered frugal innovation out of sheer necessity.
p263
aVThe North is now learning to do more and better with less
p264
aVas it faces resource constraints.
p265
aVAs an Indian-born French national who lives in the United States,
p266
aVmy hope is that we transcend this artificial North-South divide
p267
aVso that we can harness the collective ingenuity
p268
aVof innovators from around the world
p269
aVto cocreate frugal solutions
p270
aVthat will improve the quality of life of everyone in the world,
p271
aVwhile preserving our precious planet.
p272
aa(lp273
VThank you very much.
