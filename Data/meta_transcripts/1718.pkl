VWe always hear that texting is a scourge.
p4
aVThe idea is that texting spells the decline and fall
p5
aVof any kind of serious literacy, or at least writing ability,
p6
aVamong young people in the United States
p7
aVand now the whole world today.
p8
aVThe fact of the matter is that it just isn't true,
p9
aVand it's easy to think that it is true,
p10
aVbut in order to see it in another way,
p11
aVin order to see that actually texting is a miraculous thing,
p12
aVnot just energetic, but a miraculous thing,
p13
aVa kind of emergent complexity
p14
aVthat we're seeing happening right now,
p15
aVwe have to pull the camera back for a bit
p16
aVand look at what language really is,
p17
aVin which case, one thing that we see
p18
aVis that texting is not writing at all.
p19
aVWhat do I mean by that?
p20
aa(lp21
VBasically, if we think about language,
p22
aVlanguage has existed for perhaps 150,000 years,
p23
aVat least 80,000 years,
p24
aVand what it arose as is speech. People talked.
p25
aVThat's what we're probably genetically specified for.
p26
aVThat's how we use language most.
p27
aVWriting is something that came along much later,
p28
aVand as we saw in the last talk,
p29
aVthere's a little bit of controversy as to exactly when that happened,
p30
aVbut according to traditional estimates,
p31
aVif humanity had existed for 24 hours,
p32
aVthen writing only came along at about 11:07 p.m.
p33
aVThat's how much of a latterly thing writing is.
p34
aVSo first there's speech, and then writing comes along
p35
aVas a kind of artifice.
p36
aa(lp37
VNow don't get me wrong, writing has certain advantages.
p38
aVWhen you write, because it's a conscious process,
p39
aVbecause you can look backwards,
p40
aVyou can do things with language that are much less likely
p41
aVif you're just talking.
p42
aVFor example, imagine a passage from Edward Gibbon's
p43
aV"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire:"
p44
aa(lp45
V"The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours,
p46
aVtill the graduate retreat of the Persians was changed
p47
aVinto a disorderly flight, of which the shameful example
p48
aVwas given by the principal leaders and the Surenas himself."
p49
aa(lp50
VThat's beautiful, but let's face it, nobody talks that way.
p51
aVOr at least, they shouldn't if they're interested
p52
aVin reproducing. That \u2014
p53
aV(Laughter)
p54
aVis not the way any human being speaks casually.
p55
aa(lp56
VCasual speech is something quite different.
p57
aVLinguists have actually shown
p58
aVthat when we're speaking casually in an unmonitored way,
p59
aVwe tend to speak in word packets of maybe
p60
aVseven to 10 words.
p61
aVYou'll notice this if you ever have occasion to record
p62
aVyourself or a group of people talking.
p63
aVThat's what speech is like.
p64
aVSpeech is much looser. It's much more telegraphic.
p65
aVIt's much less reflective \u2014 very different from writing.
p66
aVSo we naturally tend to think, because we see language
p67
aVwritten so often, that that's what language is,
p68
aVbut actually what language is, is speech. They are two things.
p69
aa(lp70
VNow of course, as history has gone by,
p71
aVit's been natural for there to be a certain amount of bleed
p72
aVbetween speech and writing.
p73
aVSo, for example, in a distant era now,
p74
aVit was common when one gave a speech
p75
aVto basically talk like writing.
p76
aVSo I mean the kind of speech that you see someone giving
p77
aVin an old movie where they clear their throat, and they go,
p78
aV"Ahem, ladies and gentlemen," and then they speak
p79
aVin a certain way which has nothing to do with casual speech.
p80
aVIt's formal. It uses long sentences like this Gibbon one.
p81
aVIt's basically talking like you write, and so, for example,
p82
aVwe're thinking so much these days about Lincoln
p83
aVbecause of the movie.
p84
aVThe Gettysburg Address was not the main meal of that event.
p85
aVFor two hours before that, Edward Everett spoke
p86
aVon a topic that, frankly, cannot engage us today
p87
aVand barely did then.
p88
aVThe point of it was to listen to him
p89
aVspeaking like writing.
p90
aVOrdinary people stood and listened to that for two hours.
p91
aVIt was perfectly natural.
p92
aVThat's what people did then, speaking like writing.
p93
aa(lp94
VWell, if you can speak like writing,
p95
aVthen logically it follows that you might want to also
p96
aVsometimes write like you speak.
p97
aVThe problem was just that in the material,
p98
aVmechanical sense, that was harder back in the day
p99
aVfor the simple reason that materials don't lend themselves to it.
p100
aVIt's almost impossible to do that with your hand
p101
aVexcept in shorthand, and then communication is limited.
p102
aVOn a manual typewriter it was very difficult,
p103
aVand even when we had electric typewriters,
p104
aVor then computer keyboards, the fact is
p105
aVthat even if you can type easily enough to keep up
p106
aVwith the pace of speech, more or less, you have to have
p107
aVsomebody who can receive your message quickly.
p108
aa(lp109
VOnce you have things in your pocket that can receive that message,
p110
aVthen you have the conditions that allow
p111
aVthat we can write like we speak.
p112
aVAnd that's where texting comes in.
p113
aVAnd so, texting is very loose in its structure.
p114
aVNo one thinks about capital letters or punctuation when one texts,
p115
aVbut then again, do you think about those things when you talk?
p116
aVNo, and so therefore why would you when you were texting?
p117
aa(lp118
VWhat texting is, despite the fact that it involves
p119
aVthe brute mechanics of something that we call writing,
p120
aVis fingered speech. That's what texting is.
p121
aVNow we can write the way we talk.
p122
aVAnd it's a very interesting thing, but nevertheless
p123
aVeasy to think that still it represents some sort of decline.
p124
aVWe see this general bagginess of the structure,
p125
aVthe lack of concern with rules and the way that we're used to
p126
aVlearning on the blackboard, and so we think
p127
aVthat something has gone wrong.
p128
aVIt's a very natural sense.
p129
aa(lp130
VBut the fact of the matter is that what is going on
p131
aVis a kind of emergent complexity.
p132
aVThat's what we're seeing in this fingered speech.
p133
aVAnd in order to understand it, what we want to see
p134
aVis the way, in this new kind of language,
p135
aVthere is new structure coming up.
p136
aa(lp137
VAnd so, for example, there is in texting a convention,
p138
aVwhich is LOL.
p139
aVNow LOL, we generally think of
p140
aVas meaning "laughing out loud."
p141
aVAnd of course, theoretically, it does,
p142
aVand if you look at older texts, then people used it
p143
aVto actually indicate laughing out loud.
p144
aVBut if you text now, or if you are someone who
p145
aVis aware of the substrate of texting the way it's become,
p146
aVyou'll notice that LOL
p147
aVdoes not mean laughing out loud anymore.
p148
aVIt's evolved into something that is much subtler.
p149
aa(lp150
VThis is an actual text that was done
p151
aVby a non-male person of about 20 years old
p152
aVnot too long ago.
p153
aa(lp154
V"I love the font you're using, btw."
p155
aa(lp156
VJulie: "lol thanks gmail is being slow right now"
p157
aa(lp158
VNow if you think about it, that's not funny.
p159
aVNo one's laughing. (Laughter)
p160
aVAnd yet, there it is, so you assume
p161
aVthere's been some kind of hiccup.
p162
aa(lp163
VThen Susan says "lol, I know,"
p164
aVagain more guffawing than we're used to
p165
aVwhen you're talking about these inconveniences.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo Julie says, "I just sent you an email."
p168
aa(lp169
VSusan: "lol, I see it."
p170
aa(lp171
VVery funny people, if that's what LOL means.
p172
aa(lp173
VThis Julie says, "So what's up?"
p174
aa(lp175
VSusan: "lol, I have to write a 10 page paper."
p176
aa(lp177
VShe's not amused. Let's think about it.
p178
aVLOL is being used in a very particular way.
p179
aVIt's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation.
p180
aVWe linguists call things like that pragmatic particles.
p181
aVAny spoken language that's used by real people has them.
p182
aVIf you happen to speak Japanese, think about
p183
aVthat little word "ne" that you use at the end of a lot of sentences.
p184
aVIf you listen to the way black youth today speak,
p185
aVthink about the use of the word "yo."
p186
aVWhole dissertations could be written about it,
p187
aVand probably are being written about it.
p188
aVA pragmatic particle, that's what LOL has gradually become.
p189
aVIt's a way of using the language between actual people.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnother example is "slash."
p192
aVNow, we can use slash in the way that we're used to,
p193
aValong the lines of, "We're going to have
p194
aVa party-slash-networking session."
p195
aVThat's kind of like what we're at.
p196
aVSlash is used in a very different way
p197
aVin texting among young people today.
p198
aVIt's used to change the scene.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo for example, this Sally person says,
p201
aV"So I need to find people to chill with"
p202
aVand Jake says, "Haha" \u2014
p203
aVyou could write a dissertation about "Haha" too, but we don't have time for that \u2014
p204
aV"Haha so you're going by yourself? Why?"
p205
aa(lp206
VSally: "For this summer program at NYU."
p207
aa(lp208
VJake: "Haha. Slash I'm watching this video with suns players
p209
aVtrying to shoot with one eye."
p210
aa(lp211
VThe slash is interesting.
p212
aVI don't really even know what Jake is talking about after that,
p213
aVbut you notice that he's changing the topic.
p214
aVNow that seems kind of mundane,
p215
aVbut think about how in real life,
p216
aVif we're having a conversation and we want to change the topic,
p217
aVthere are ways of doing it gracefully.
p218
aVYou don't just zip right into it.
p219
aVYou'll pat your thighs and look wistfully off into the distance,
p220
aVor you'll say something like, "Hmm, makes you think \u2014"
p221
aVwhen it really didn't, but what you're really \u2014
p222
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p223
aVwhat you're really trying to do is change the topic.
p224
aVYou can't do that while you're texting,
p225
aVand so ways are developing of doing it within this medium.
p226
aVAll spoken languages have what a linguist calls
p227
aVa new information marker \u2014 or two, or three.
p228
aVTexting has developed one from this slash.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo we have a whole battery of new constructions
p231
aVthat are developing, and yet it's easy to think,
p232
aVwell, something is still wrong.
p233
aVThere's a lack of structure of some sort.
p234
aVIt's not as sophisticated
p235
aVas the language of The Wall Street Journal.
p236
aVWell, the fact of the matter is,
p237
aVlook at this person in 1956,
p238
aVand this is when texting doesn't exist,
p239
aV"I Love Lucy" is still on the air.
p240
aa(lp241
V"Many do not know the alphabet or multiplication table,
p242
aVcannot write grammatically \u2014 "
p243
aa(lp244
VWe've heard that sort of thing before,
p245
aVnot just in 1956. 1917, Connecticut schoolteacher.
p246
aV1917. This is the time when we all assume
p247
aVthat everything somehow in terms of writing was perfect
p248
aVbecause the people on "Downton Abbey" are articulate,
p249
aVor something like that.
p250
aa(lp251
VSo, "From every college in the country goes up the cry,
p252
aV'Our freshmen can't spell, can't punctuate.'"
p253
aa(lp254
VAnd so on. You can go even further back than this.
p255
aVIt's the President of Harvard. It's 1871.
p256
aVThere's no electricity. People have three names.
p257
aa(lp258
V"Bad spelling,
p259
aVincorrectness as well as inelegance of expression in writing."
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd he's talking about people who are otherwise
p262
aVwell prepared for college studies.
p263
aa(lp264
VYou can go even further back.
p265
aV1841, some long-lost superintendent of schools is upset
p266
aVbecause of what he has for a long time "noted with regret
p267
aVthe almost entire neglect of the original" blah blah blah blah blah.
p268
aa(lp269
VOr you can go all the way back to 63 A.D. \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p270
aVand there's this poor man who doesn't like the way
p271
aVpeople are speaking Latin.
p272
aVAs it happens, he was writing about what had become French.
p273
aVAnd so, there are always \u2014 (Laughter) (Applause) \u2014
p274
aVthere are always people worrying about these things
p275
aVand the planet somehow seems to keep spinning.
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd so, the way I'm thinking of texting these days is
p278
aVthat what we're seeing is a whole new way of writing
p279
aVthat young people are developing,
p280
aVwhich they're using alongside their ordinary writing skills,
p281
aVand that means that they're able to do two things.
p282
aVIncreasing evidence is that being bilingual
p283
aVis cognitively beneficial.
p284
aVThat's also true of being bidialectal.
p285
aVThat's certainly true of being bidialectal in terms of your writing.
p286
aVAnd so texting actually is evidence of a balancing act
p287
aVthat young people are using today, not consciously, of course,
p288
aVbut it's an expansion of their linguistic repertoire.
p289
aVIt's very simple.
p290
aVIf somebody from 1973 looked at
p291
aVwhat was on a dormitory message board in 1993,
p292
aVthe slang would have changed a little bit
p293
aVsince the era of "Love Story,"
p294
aVbut they would understand what was on that message board.
p295
aVTake that person from 1993 \u2014 not that long ago,
p296
aVthis is "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" \u2014 those people.
p297
aVTake those people and they read
p298
aVa very typical text written by a 20-year-old today.
p299
aVOften they would have no idea what half of it meant
p300
aVbecause a whole new language has developed
p301
aVamong our young people doing something as mundane
p302
aVas what it looks like to us when they're batting around
p303
aVon their little devices.
p304
aa(lp305
VSo in closing, if I could go into the future,
p306
aVif I could go into 2033,
p307
aVthe first thing I would ask is whether David Simon
p308
aVhad done a sequel to "The Wire." I would want to know.
p309
aVAnd \u2014 I really would ask that \u2014
p310
aVand then I'd want to know actually what was going on on "Downton Abbey."
p311
aVThat'd be the second thing.
p312
aVAnd then the third thing would be,
p313
aVplease show me a sheaf of texts
p314
aVwritten by 16-year-old girls,
p315
aVbecause I would want to know where this language
p316
aVhad developed since our times,
p317
aVand ideally I would then send them back to you and me now
p318
aVso we could examine this linguistic miracle
p319
aVhappening right under our noses.
p320
aVThank you very much.
p321
aa(lp322
V(Applause)
p323
aVThank you. (Applause)
