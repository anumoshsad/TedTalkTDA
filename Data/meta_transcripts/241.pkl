VI\u2019m working a lot with motion and animation,
p4
aVand also I'm an old DJ and a musician.
p5
aVSo, music videos are something that I always found interesting,
p6
aVbut they always seem to be so reactive.
p7
aVSo I was thinking, can you remove us as creators
p8
aVand try to make the music be the voice
p9
aVand have the animation following it?
p10
aVSo with two designers, Tolga and Christina, at my office, we took a track \u2014
p11
aVmany of you probably know it. It\u2019s about 25 years old,
p12
aVand it's David Byrne and Brian Eno \u2014
p13
aVand we did this little animation.
p14
aVAnd I think that it's maybe interesting, also,
p15
aVthat it deals with two problematic issues,
p16
aVwhich are rising waters and religion.

VSong: Before God destroyed the people on the Earth,
p19
aVhe warned Noah to build an Ark.

aVAnd after Noah built his Ark,
p21
aVI believe he told Noah to warn the people
p22
aVthat they must change all their wicked ways
p23
aVbefore he come upon them and destroy them.
p24
aVAnd when Noah had done built his Ark,
p25
aVI understand that somebody began to rend a song.
p26

p27
aVAnd when Noah had done built his Ark ...
p28
aVMove on ... In fact ... Concern ...
p29
aVSo they get tired, has come dark and rain; they get weary and tired.
p30
aVAnd then he went and knocked an old lady house.
p31
aVAnd old lady ran to the door and say, "Who is it?"
p32
aVJack say, "Me, Mama-san, could we spend the night here?
p33
aVBecause we\u2019re far from home, we\u2019re very tired."
p34
aVAnd the old lady said, "Oh yes, come on in."
