V"Pheromone" is a very powerful word.
p4
aVIt conjures up sex, abandon, loss of control,
p5
aVand you can see, it's very important as a word.
p6
aVBut it's only 50 years old. It was invented in 1959.
p7
aVNow, if you put that word into the web,
p8
aVas you may have done,
p9
aVyou'll come up with millions of hits,
p10
aVand almost all of those sites are trying to sell you
p11
aVsomething to make you irresistible
p12
aVfor 10 dollars or more.
p13
aVNow, this is a very attractive idea,
p14
aVand the molecules they mention
p15
aVsound really science-y.
p16
aVThey've got lots of syllables.
p17
aVIt's things like androstenol, androstenone
p18
aVor androstadienone.
p19
aVIt gets better and better,
p20
aVand when you combine that with white lab coats,
p21
aVyou must imagine that there is
p22
aVfantastic science behind this.
p23
aVBut sadly, these are fraudulent claims
p24
aVsupported by dodgy science.
p25
aa(lp26
VThe problem is that, although there are many
p27
aVgood scientists working on what they think
p28
aVare human pheromones,
p29
aVand they're publishing in respectable journals,
p30
aVat the basis of this,
p31
aVdespite very sophisticated experiments,
p32
aVthere really is no good science behind it,
p33
aVbecause it's based on a problem,
p34
aVwhich is nobody has systematically gone through
p35
aVall the odors that humans produce \u2014
p36
aVand there are thousands of molecules that we give off.
p37
aVWe're mammals. We produce a lot of smell.
p38
aVNobody has gone through systematically
p39
aVto work out which molecules really are pheromones.
p40
aVThey've just plucked a few,
p41
aVand all these experiments are based on those,
p42
aVbut there's no good evidence at all.
p43
aa(lp44
VNow, that's not to say
p45
aVthat smell is not important to people.
p46
aVIt is, and some people are real enthusiasts,
p47
aVand one of these was Napoleon.
p48
aVAnd famously, you may remember
p49
aVthat out on the campaign trail for war,
p50
aVhe wrote to his lover, Empress Josephine,
p51
aVsaying, "Don't wash. I'm coming home."
p52
aV(Laughter)
p53
aVSo he didn't want to lose any of her richness
p54
aVin the days before he'd get home,
p55
aVand it is still, you'll find websites
p56
aVthat offer this as a major quirk.
p57
aVAt the same time, though,
p58
aVwe spend about as much money
p59
aVtaking the smells off us
p60
aVas putting them back on in perfumes,
p61
aVand perfumes are a multi-billion-dollar business.
p62
aa(lp63
VSo what I want to do in the rest of this talk
p64
aVis tell you about what pheromones really are,
p65
aVtell you why I think we would expect
p66
aVhumans to have pheromones,
p67
aVtell you about some of the confusions in pheromones,
p68
aVand then finally, I want to end with
p69
aVa promising avenue which shows us
p70
aVthe way we ought to be going.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo the ancient Greeks knew
p73
aVthat dogs sent invisible signals between each other.
p74
aVA female dog in heat
p75
aVsent an invisible signal to male dogs
p76
aVfor miles around,
p77
aVand it wasn't a sound, it was a smell.
p78
aVYou could take the smell from the female dog,
p79
aVand the dogs would chase the cloth.
p80
aVBut the problem for everybody
p81
aVwho could see this effect
p82
aVwas that you couldn't identify the molecules.
p83
aVYou couldn't demonstrate it was chemical.
p84
aVThe reason for that, of course,
p85
aVis that each of these animals
p86
aVproduces tiny quantities,
p87
aVand in the case of the dog,
p88
aVmales dogs can smell it, but we can't smell it.
p89
aVAnd it was only in 1959 that a German team,
p90
aVafter spending 20 years in search of these molecules,
p91
aVdiscovered, identified, the first pheromone,
p92
aVand this was the sex pheromone of a silk moth.
p93
aVNow, this was an inspired choice  by Adolf Butenandt and his team,
p94
aVbecause he needed half a million moths
p95
aVto get enough material to do the chemical analysis.
p96
aVBut he created the model
p97
aVfor how you should go about pheromone analysis.
p98
aVHe basically went through systematically,
p99
aVshowing that only the molecule in question
p100
aVwas the one that stimulated the males,
p101
aVnot all the others.
p102
aVHe analyzed it very carefully.
p103
aVHe synthesized the molecule,
p104
aVand then tried the synthesized molecule on the males
p105
aVand got them to respond and showed it was,
p106
aVindeed, that molecule.
p107
aVThat's closing the circle.
p108
aVThat's the thing which has never been done with humans:
p109
aVnothing systematic, no real demonstration.
p110
aa(lp111
VWith that new concept,
p112
aVwe needed a new word,
p113
aVand that was the word "pheromone,"
p114
aVand it's basically transferred excitement,
p115
aVtransferred between individuals,
p116
aVand since 1959, pheromones have been found
p117
aVright the way across the animal kingdom,
p118
aVin male animals, in female animals.
p119
aVIt works just as well underwater
p120
aVfor goldfish and lobsters.
p121
aVAnd almost every mammal you can think of
p122
aVhas had a pheromone identified,
p123
aVand of course, an enormous number of insects.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo we know that pheromones exist
p126
aVright the way across the animal kingdom.
p127
aVWhat about humans?
p128
aVWell, the first thing, of course,
p129
aVis that we're mammals,
p130
aVand mammals are smelly.
p131
aVAs any dog owner can tell you,
p132
aVwe smell, they smell.
p133
aa(lp134
VBut the real reason we might think
p135
aVthat humans have pheromones
p136
aVis the change that occurs as we grow up.
p137
aVThe smell of a room of teenagers
p138
aVis quite different
p139
aVfrom the smell of a room of small children.
p140
aVWhat's changed? And of course, it's puberty.
p141
aVAlong with the pubic hair
p142
aVand the hair in the armpits,
p143
aVnew glands start to secrete in those places,
p144
aVand that's what's making the change in smell.
p145
aVIf we were any other kind of mammal,
p146
aVor any other kind of animal,
p147
aVwe would say,
p148
aV"That must be something to do with pheromones,"
p149
aVand we'd start looking properly.
p150
aa(lp151
VBut there are some problems, and this is why,
p152
aVI think, people have not looked for
p153
aVpheromones so effectively in humans.
p154
aVThere are, indeed, problems.
p155
aVAnd the first of these
p156
aVis perhaps surprising.
p157
aVIt's all about culture.
p158
aVNow moths don't learn a lot
p159
aVabout what is good to smell, but humans do,
p160
aVand up to the age of about four,
p161
aVany smell, no matter how rancid,
p162
aVis simply interesting.
p163
aVAnd I understand that the major role of parents
p164
aVis to stop kids putting their fingers in poo,
p165
aVbecause it's always something nice to smell.
p166
aVBut gradually we learn what's not good,
p167
aVand one of the things we learn
p168
aVat the same time as what is not good
p169
aVis what is good.
p170
aa(lp171
VNow, the cheese behind me
p172
aVis a British, if not an English, delicacy.
p173
aVIt's ripe blue Stilton.
p174
aVLiking it is incomprehensible to people from other countries.
p175
aVEvery culture has its own special food
p176
aVand national delicacy.
p177
aVIf you were to come from Iceland,
p178
aVyour national dish
p179
aVis deep rotted shark.
p180
aVNow, all of these things are acquired tastes,
p181
aVbut they form almost a badge of identity.
p182
aVYou're part of the in-group.
p183
aa(lp184
VThe second thing is the sense of smell.
p185
aVEach of us has a unique odor world,
p186
aVin the sense that what we smell,
p187
aVwe each smell a completely different world.
p188
aVNow, smell was the hardest
p189
aVof the senses to crack,
p190
aVand the Nobel Prize awarded to
p191
aVRichard Axel and Linda Buck
p192
aVwas only awarded in 2004
p193
aVfor their discovery of how smell works.
p194
aVIt's really hard,
p195
aVbut in essence, nerves from the brain
p196
aVgo up into the nose
p197
aVand on these nerves exposed in the nose
p198
aVto the outside air are receptors,
p199
aVand odor molecules coming in on a sniff
p200
aVinteract with these receptors,
p201
aVand if they bond, they send the nerve a signal
p202
aVwhich goes back into the brain.
p203
aVWe don't just have one kind of receptor.
p204
aVIf you're a human, you have about 400
p205
aVdifferent kinds of receptors,
p206
aVand the brain knows what you're smelling
p207
aVbecause of the combination of receptors
p208
aVand nerve cells that they trigger,
p209
aVsending messages up to the brain
p210
aVin a combinatorial fashion.
p211
aVBut it's a bit more complicated,
p212
aVbecause each of those 400
p213
aVcomes in various variants,
p214
aVand depending which variant you have,
p215
aVyou might smell coriander, or cilantro, that herb,
p216
aVeither as something delicious and savory
p217
aVor something like soap.
p218
aVSo we each have an individual world of smell,
p219
aVand that complicates anything
p220
aVwhen we're studying smell.
p221
aa(lp222
VWell, we really ought to talk about armpits,
p223
aVand I have to say that I do have particularly good ones.
p224
aVNow, I'm not going to share them with you,
p225
aVbut this is the place that most people
p226
aVhave looked for pheromones.
p227
aVThere is one good reason,
p228
aVwhich is, the great apes have armpits
p229
aVas their unique characteristic.
p230
aVThe other primates have scent glands
p231
aVin other parts of the body.
p232
aVThe great apes have these armpits
p233
aVfull of secretory glands
p234
aVproducing smells all the time,
p235
aVenormous numbers of molecules.
p236
aVWhen they're secreted from the glands,
p237
aVthe molecules are odorless.
p238
aVThey have no smell at all,
p239
aVand it's only the wonderful bacteria
p240
aVgrowing on the rainforest of hair
p241
aVthat actually produces the smells
p242
aVthat we know and love.
p243
aVAnd so incidentally, if you want to reduce
p244
aVthe amount of smell,
p245
aVclear-cutting your armpits
p246
aVis a very effective way of reducing
p247
aVthe habitat for bacteria,
p248
aVand you'll find they remain less smelly
p249
aVfor much longer.
p250
aVBut although we've focused on armpits,
p251
aVI think it's partly because they're the least
p252
aVembarrassing place to go and ask people for samples.
p253
aVThere is actually another reason why we might not
p254
aVbe looking for a universal sex pheromone there,
p255
aVand that's because 20 percent of the world's population
p256
aVdoesn't have smelly armpits like me.
p257
aVAnd these are people from China, Japan,
p258
aVKorea, and other parts of northeast Asia.
p259
aVThey simply don't secrete those odorless precursors
p260
aVthat the bacteria love to use to produce the smells
p261
aVthat in an ethnocentric way we always thought of
p262
aVas characteristic of armpits.
p263
aVSo it doesn't apply to 20 percent of the world.
p264
aa(lp265
VSo what should we be doing
p266
aVin our search for human pheromones?
p267
aVI'm fairly convinced that we do have them.
p268
aVWe're mammals, like everybody else
p269
aVwho's a mammal, and we probably do have them.
p270
aVBut what I think we should do
p271
aVis go right back to the beginning,
p272
aVand basically look all over the body.
p273
aVNo matter how embarrassing,
p274
aVwe need to search and go for the first time
p275
aVwhere no one else has dared tread.
p276
aVIt's going to be difficult,
p277
aVit's going to be embarrassing, but we need to look.
p278
aVWe also need to go back to the ideas
p279
aVthat Butenandt used when he was studying the silk moth.
p280
aVWe need to go back and look systematically
p281
aVat all the molecules that are being produced,
p282
aVand work out which ones are really involved.
p283
aVIt isn't good enough simply to pluck a couple
p284
aVand say, "They'll do."
p285
aVWe have to actually demonstrate
p286
aVthat they really have the effects we claim.
p287
aa(lp288
VThere is one team that I'm actually very impressed by.
p289
aVThey're in France, and their previous success
p290
aVwas identifying the rabbit mammary pheromone.
p291
aVThey've turned their attention now
p292
aVto human babies and mothers.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo this is a baby having a drink of milk
p295
aVfrom its mother's breast.
p296
aVHer nipple is completely hidden
p297
aVby the baby's head,
p298
aVbut what you'll notice is a white droplet
p299
aVwith an arrow pointing to it,
p300
aVand that's the secretion from the areolar glands.
p301
aVNow, we all have them, men and women,
p302
aVand these are the little bumps around the nipple,
p303
aVand if you're a lactating woman,
p304
aVthese start to secrete.
p305
aVIt's a very interesting secretion.
p306
aVWhat Benoist Schaal and his team developed
p307
aVwas a simple test to investigate
p308
aVwhat the effect of this secretion might be,
p309
aVin effect, a simple bioassay.
p310
aVSo this is a sleeping baby,
p311
aVand under its nose, we've put a clean glass rod.
p312
aVThe baby remains sleeping,
p313
aVshowing no interest at all.
p314
aVBut if we go to any mother
p315
aVwho is secreting from the areolar glands,
p316
aVso it's not about recognition,
p317
aVit can be from any mother,
p318
aVif we take the secretion
p319
aVand now put it under the baby's nose,
p320
aVwe get a very different reaction.
p321
aVIt's a connoisseur's reaction of delight,
p322
aVand it opens its mouth
p323
aVand sticks out its tongue
p324
aVand starts to suck.
p325
aVNow, since this is from any mother,
p326
aVit could really be a pheromone.
p327
aVIt's not about individual recognition.
p328
aVAny mother will do.
p329
aa(lp330
VNow, why is this important,
p331
aVapart from being simply very interesting?
p332
aVIt's because women vary
p333
aVin the number of areolar glands that they have,
p334
aVand there is a correlation between the ease
p335
aVwith which babies start to suckle
p336
aVand the number of areolar glands she has.
p337
aVIt appears that the more secretions she's got,
p338
aVthe more likely the baby is to suckle quickly.
p339
aVIf you're a mammal,
p340
aVthe most dangerous time in life
p341
aVis the first few hours after birth.
p342
aVYou have to get that first drink of milk,
p343
aVand if you don't get it, you won't survive.
p344
aVYou'll be dead.
p345
aVSince many babies actually find it difficult
p346
aVto take that first meal,
p347
aVbecause they're not getting the right stimulus,
p348
aVif we could identify what that molecule was,
p349
aVand the French team are being very cautious,
p350
aVbut if we could identify the molecule,
p351
aVsynthesize it, it would then mean
p352
aVpremature babies would be more likely to suckle,
p353
aVand every baby would have a better chance
p354
aVof survival.
p355
aVSo what I want to argue is this is one example
p356
aVof where a systematic, really scientific approach
p357
aVcan actually bring you a real understanding
p358
aVof pheromones.
p359
aVThere could be all sorts of medical interventions.
p360
aVThere could be all sorts of things
p361
aVthat humans are doing with pheromones
p362
aVthat we simply don't know at the moment.
p363
aVWhat we need to remember is pheromones
p364
aVare not just about sex.
p365
aVThey're about all sorts of things to do
p366
aVwith a mammal's life.
p367
aVSo do go forward and do search for more.
p368
aVThere's lots to find.
