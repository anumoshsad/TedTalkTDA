VWhether you like it or not,
p4
aVradical transparency and algorithmic decision-making is coming at you fast,
p5
aVand it's going to change your life.
p6
aVThat's because it's now easy to take algorithms
p7
aVand embed them into computers
p8
aVand gather all that data that you're leaving on yourself
p9
aVall over the place,
p10
aVand know what you're like,
p11
aVand then direct the computers to interact with you
p12
aVin ways that are better than most people can.
p13
aa(lp14
VWell, that might sound scary.
p15
aVI've been doing this for a long time and I have found it to be wonderful.
p16
aVMy objective has been to have meaningful work
p17
aVand meaningful relationships with the people I work with,
p18
aVand I've learned that I couldn't have that
p19
aVunless I had that radical transparency and that algorithmic decision-making.
p20
aVI want to show you why that is,
p21
aVI want to show you how it works.
p22
aVAnd I warn you that some of the things that I'm going to show you
p23
aVprobably are a little bit shocking.
p24
aa(lp25
VSince I was a kid, I've had a terrible rote memory.
p26
aVAnd I didn't like following instructions,
p27
aVI was no good at following instructions.
p28
aVBut I loved to figure out how things worked for myself.
p29
aVWhen I was 12,
p30
aVI hated school but I fell in love with trading the markets.
p31
aVI caddied at the time,
p32
aVearned about five dollars a bag.
p33
aVAnd I took my caddying money, and I put it in the stock market.
p34
aVAnd that was just because the stock market was hot at the time.
p35
aVAnd the first company I bought
p36
aVwas a company by the name of Northeast Airlines.
p37
aVNortheast Airlines was the only company I heard of
p38
aVthat was selling for less than five dollars a share.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd I figured I could buy more shares,
p43
aVand if it went up, I'd make more money.
p44
aVSo, it was a dumb strategy, right?
p45
aVBut I tripled my money,
p46
aVand I tripled my money because I got lucky.
p47
aVThe company was about to go bankrupt,
p48
aVbut some other company acquired it,
p49
aVand I tripled my money.
p50
aVAnd I was hooked.
p51
aVAnd I thought, "This game is easy."
p52
aVWith time,
p53
aVI learned this game is anything but easy.
p54
aa(lp55
VIn order to be an effective investor,
p56
aVone has to bet against the consensus
p57
aVand be right.
p58
aVAnd it's not easy to bet against the consensus and be right.
p59
aVOne has to bet against the consensus and be right
p60
aVbecause the consensus is built into the price.
p61
aVAnd in order to be an entrepreneur,
p62
aVa successful entrepreneur,
p63
aVone has to bet against the consensus and be right.
p64
aVI had to be an entrepreneur and an investor \u2014
p65
aVand what goes along with that is making a lot of painful mistakes.
p66
aVSo I made a lot of painful mistakes,
p67
aVand with time,
p68
aVmy attitude about those mistakes began to change.
p69
aVI began to think of them as puzzles.
p70
aVThat if I could solve the puzzles,
p71
aVthey would give me gems.
p72
aVAnd the puzzles were:
p73
aVWhat would I do differently in the future so I wouldn't make that painful mistake?
p74
aVAnd the gems were principles
p75
aVthat I would then write down so I would remember them
p76
aVthat would help me in the future.
p77
aVAnd because I wrote them down so clearly,
p78
aVI could then \u2014
p79
aVeventually discovered \u2014
p80
aVI could then embed them into algorithms.
p81
aVAnd those algorithms would be embedded in computers,
p82
aVand the computers would make decisions along with me;
p83
aVand so in parallel, we would make these decisions.
p84
aVAnd I could see how those decisions then compared with my own decisions,
p85
aVand I could see that those decisions were a lot better.
p86
aVAnd that was because the computer could make decisions much faster,
p87
aVit could process a lot more information
p88
aVand it can process decisions much more \u2014
p89
aVless emotionally.
p90
aVSo it radically improved my decision-making.
p91
aa(lp92
VEight years after I started Bridgewater,
p93
aVI had my greatest failure,
p94
aVmy greatest mistake.
p95
aVIt was late 1970s,
p96
aVI was 34 years old,
p97
aVand I had calculated that American banks
p98
aVhad lent much more money to emerging countries
p99
aVthan those countries were going to be able to pay back
p100
aVand that we would have the greatest debt crisis
p101
aVsince the Great Depression.
p102
aVAnd with it, an economic crisis
p103
aVand a big bear market in stocks.
p104
aVIt was a controversial view at the time.
p105
aVPeople thought it was kind of a crazy point of view.
p106
aVBut in August 1982,
p107
aVMexico defaulted on its debt,
p108
aVand a number of other countries followed.
p109
aVAnd we had the greatest debt crisis since the Great Depression.
p110
aVAnd because I had anticipated that,
p111
aVI was asked to testify to Congress and appear on "Wall Street Week,"
p112
aVwhich was the show of the time.
p113
aVJust to give you a flavor of that, I've got a clip here,
p114
aVand you'll see me in there.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Video) Mr. Chairman, Mr. Mitchell,
p117
aVit's a great pleasure and a great honor to be able to appear before you
p118
aVin examination with what is going wrong with our economy.
p119
aVThe economy is now flat \u2014
p120
aVteetering on the brink of failure.
p121
aa(lp122
VMartin Zweig: You were recently quoted in an article.
p123
aVYou said, "I can say this with absolute certainty
p124
aVbecause I know how markets work."
p125
aa(lp126
VRay Dalio: I can say with absolute certainty
p127
aVthat if you look at the liquidity base
p128
aVin the corporations and the world as a whole,
p129
aVthat there's such reduced level of liquidity
p130
aVthat you can't return to an era of stagflation."
p131
aa(lp132
VI look at that now, I think, "What an arrogant jerk!"
p133
aa(lp134
V(Laughter)
p135
aa(lp136
VI was so arrogant, and I was so wrong.
p137
aVI mean, while the debt crisis happened,
p138
aVthe stock market and the economy went up rather than going down,
p139
aVand I lost so much money for myself and for my clients
p140
aVthat I had to shut down my operation pretty much,
p141
aVI had to let almost everybody go.
p142
aVAnd these were like extended family,
p143
aVI was heartbroken.
p144
aVAnd I had lost so much money
p145
aVthat I had to borrow 4,000 dollars from my dad
p146
aVto help to pay my family bills.
p147
aa(lp148
VIt was one of the most painful experiences of my life ...
p149
aVbut it turned out to be one of the greatest experiences of my life
p150
aVbecause it changed my attitude about decision-making.
p151
aVRather than thinking, "I'm right,"
p152
aVI started to ask myself,
p153
aV"How do I know I'm right?"
p154
aVI gained a humility that I needed
p155
aVin order to balance my audacity.
p156
aVI wanted to find the smartest people who would disagree with me
p157
aVto try to understand their perspective
p158
aVor to have them stress test my perspective.
p159
aVI wanted to make an idea meritocracy.
p160
aVIn other words,
p161
aVnot an autocracy in which I would lead and others would follow
p162
aVand not a democracy in which everybody's points of view were equally valued,
p163
aVbut I wanted to have an idea meritocracy in which the best ideas would win out.
p164
aVAnd in order to do that,
p165
aVI realized that we would need radical truthfulness
p166
aVand radical transparency.
p167
aa(lp168
VWhat I mean by radical truthfulness and radical transparency
p169
aVis people needed to say what they really believed
p170
aVand to see everything.
p171
aVAnd we literally tape almost all conversations
p172
aVand let everybody see everything,
p173
aVbecause if we didn't do that,
p174
aVwe couldn't really have an idea meritocracy.
p175
aVIn order to have an idea meritocracy,
p176
aVwe have let people speak and say what they want.
p177
aVJust to give you an example,
p178
aVthis is an email from Jim Haskel \u2014
p179
aVsomebody who works for me \u2014
p180
aVand this was available to everybody in the company.
p181
aV"Ray, you deserve a 'D-'
p182
aVfor your performance today in the meeting ...
p183
aVyou did not prepare at all well
p184
aVbecause there is no way you could have been that disorganized."
p185
aVIsn't that great?
p186
aa(lp187
V(Laughter)
p188
aa(lp189
VThat's great.
p190
aVIt's great because, first of all, I needed feedback like that.
p191
aVI need feedback like that.
p192
aVAnd it's great because if I don't let Jim, and people like Jim,
p193
aVto express their points of view,
p194
aVour relationship wouldn't be the same.
p195
aVAnd if I didn't make that public for everybody to see,
p196
aVwe wouldn't have an idea meritocracy.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo for that last 25 years that's how we've been operating.
p199
aVWe've been operating with this radical transparency
p200
aVand then collecting these principles,
p201
aVlargely from making mistakes,
p202
aVand then embedding those principles into algorithms.
p203
aVAnd then those algorithms provide \u2014
p204
aVwe're following the algorithms
p205
aVin parallel with our thinking.
p206
aVThat has been how we've run the investment business,
p207
aVand it's how we also deal with the people management.
p208
aa(lp209
VIn order to give you a glimmer into what this looks like,
p210
aVI'd like to take you into a meeting
p211
aVand introduce you to a tool of ours called the "Dot Collector"
p212
aVthat helps us do this.
p213
aVA week after the US election,
p214
aVour research team held a meeting
p215
aVto discuss what a Trump presidency would mean for the US economy.
p216
aVNaturally, people had different opinions on the matter
p217
aVand how we were approaching the discussion.
p218
aVThe "Dot Collector" collects these views.
p219
aVIt has a list of a few dozen attributes,
p220
aVso whenever somebody thinks something about another person's thinking,
p221
aVit's easy for them to convey their assessment;
p222
aVthey simply note the attribute and provide a rating from one to 10.
p223
aVFor example, as the meeting began,
p224
aVa researcher named Jen rated me a three \u2014
p225
aVin other words, badly \u2014
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
Vfor not showing a good balance of open-mindedness and assertiveness.
p230
aVAs the meeting transpired,
p231
aVJen's assessments of people added up like this.
p232
aVOthers in the room have different opinions.
p233
aVThat's normal.
p234
aVDifferent people are always going to have different opinions.
p235
aVAnd who knows who's right?
p236
aVLet's look at just what people thought about how I was doing.
p237
aVSome people thought I did well,
p238
aVothers, poorly.
p239
aVWith each of these views,
p240
aVwe can explore the thinking behind the numbers.
p241
aVHere's what Jen and Larry said.
p242
aVNote that everyone gets to express their thinking,
p243
aVincluding their critical thinking,
p244
aVregardless of their position in the company.
p245
aVJen, who's 24 years old and right out of college,
p246
aVcan tell me, the CEO, that I'm approaching things terribly.
p247
aa(lp248
VThis tool helps people both express their opinions
p249
aVand then separate themselves from their opinions
p250
aVto see things from a higher level.
p251
aVWhen Jen and others shift their attentions from inputting their own opinions
p252
aVto looking down on the whole screen,
p253
aVtheir perspective changes.
p254
aVThey see their own opinions as just one of many
p255
aVand naturally start asking themselves,
p256
aV"How do I know my opinion is right?"
p257
aVThat shift in perspective is like going from seeing in one dimension
p258
aVto seeing in multiple dimensions.
p259
aVAnd it shifts the conversation from arguing over our opinions
p260
aVto figuring out objective criteria for determining which opinions are best.
p261
aa(lp262
VBehind the "Dot Collector" is a computer that is watching.
p263
aVIt watches what all these people are thinking
p264
aVand it correlates that with how they think.
p265
aVAnd it communicates advice back to each of them based on that.
p266
aVThen it draws the data from all the meetings
p267
aVto create a pointilist painting of what people are like
p268
aVand how they think.
p269
aVAnd it does that guided by algorithms.
p270
aVKnowing what people are like helps to match them better with their jobs.
p271
aVFor example,
p272
aVa creative thinker who is unreliable
p273
aVmight be matched up with someone who's reliable but not creative.
p274
aVKnowing what people are like also allows us to decide
p275
aVwhat responsibilities to give them
p276
aVand to weigh our decisions based on people's merits.
p277
aVWe call it their believability.
p278
aVHere's an example of a vote that we took
p279
aVwhere the majority of people felt one way ...
p280
aVbut when we weighed the views based on people's merits,
p281
aVthe answer was completely different.
p282
aVThis process allows us to make decisions not based on democracy,
p283
aVnot based on autocracy,
p284
aVbut based on algorithms that take people's believability into consideration.
p285
aa(lp286
VYup, we really do this.
p287
aa(lp288
V(Laughter)
p289
aa(lp290
VWe do it because it eliminates
p291
aVwhat I believe to be one of the greatest tragedies of mankind,
p292
aVand that is people arrogantly,
p293
aVnaïvely holding opinions in their minds that are wrong,
p294
aVand acting on them,
p295
aVand not putting them out there to stress test them.
p296
aVAnd that's a tragedy.
p297
aVAnd we do it because it elevates ourselves above our own opinions
p298
aVso that we start to see things through everybody's eyes,
p299
aVand we see things collectively.
p300
aVCollective decision-making is so much better than individual decision-making
p301
aVif it's done well.
p302
aVIt's been the secret sauce behind our success.
p303
aVIt's why we've made more money for our clients
p304
aVthan any other hedge fund in existence
p305
aVand made money 23 out of the last 26 years.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo what's the problem with being radically truthful
p308
aVand radically transparent with each other?
p309
aVPeople say it's emotionally difficult.
p310
aVCritics say it's a formula for a brutal work environment.
p311
aVNeuroscientists tell me it has to do with how are brains are prewired.
p312
aVThere's a part of our brain that would like to know our mistakes
p313
aVand like to look at our weaknesses so we could do better.
p314
aVI'm told that that's the prefrontal cortex.
p315
aVAnd then there's a part of our brain which views all of this as attacks.
p316
aVI'm told that that's the amygdala.
p317
aVIn other words, there are two you's inside you:
p318
aVthere's an emotional you
p319
aVand there's an intellectual you,
p320
aVand often they're at odds,
p321
aVand often they work against you.
p322
aVIt's been our experience that we can win this battle.
p323
aVWe win it as a group.
p324
aVIt takes about 18 months typically
p325
aVto find that most people prefer operating this way,
p326
aVwith this radical transparency
p327
aVthan to be operating in a more opaque environment.
p328
aVThere's not politics, there's not the brutality of \u2014
p329
aVyou know, all of that hidden, behind-the-scenes \u2014
p330
aVthere's an idea meritocracy where people can speak up.
p331
aVAnd that's been great.
p332
aVIt's given us more effective work,
p333
aVand it's given us more effective relationships.
p334
aVBut it's not for everybody.
p335
aVWe found something like 25 or 30 percent of the population
p336
aVit's just not for.
p337
aVAnd by the way,
p338
aVwhen I say radical transparency,
p339
aVI'm not saying transparency about everything.
p340
aVI mean, you don't have to tell somebody that their bald spot is growing
p341
aVor their baby's ugly.
p342
aVSo, I'm just talking about \u2014
p343
aa(lp344
V(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
Vtalking about the important things.
p347
aVSo \u2014
p348
aa(lp349
V(Laughter)
p350
aa(lp351
VSo when you leave this room,
p352
aVI'd like you to observe yourself in conversations with others.
p353
aVImagine if you knew what they were really thinking,
p354
aVand imagine if you knew what they were really like ...
p355
aVand imagine if they knew what you were really thinking
p356
aVand what were really like.
p357
aVIt would certainly clear things up a lot
p358
aVand make your operations together more effective.
p359
aVI think it will improve your relationships.
p360
aVNow imagine that you can have algorithms
p361
aVthat will help you gather all of that information
p362
aVand even help you make decisions in an idea-meritocratic way.
p363
aVThis sort of radical transparency is coming at you
p364
aVand it is going to affect your life.
p365
aVAnd in my opinion,
p366
aVit's going to be wonderful.
p367
aVSo I hope it is as wonderful for you
p368
aVas it is for me.
p369
