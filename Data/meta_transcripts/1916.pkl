VScience,
p4
aVscience has allowed us to know so much
p5
aVabout the far reaches of the universe,
p6
aVwhich is at the same time tremendously important
p7
aVand extremely remote,
p8
aVand yet much, much closer,
p9
aVmuch more directly related to us,
p10
aVthere are many things we don't really understand.
p11
aVAnd one of them is the extraordinary
p12
aVsocial complexity of the animals around us,
p13
aVand today I want to tell you a few stories
p14
aVof animal complexity.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut first, what do we call complexity?
p17
aVWhat is complex?
p18
aVWell, complex is not complicated.
p19
aVSomething complicated comprises many small parts,
p20
aVall different, and each of them
p21
aVhas its own precise role in the machinery.
p22
aVOn the opposite, a complex system
p23
aVis made of many, many similar parts,
p24
aVand it is their interaction
p25
aVthat produces a globally coherent behavior.
p26
aVComplex systems have many interacting parts
p27
aVwhich behave according to simple, individual rules,
p28
aVand this results in emergent properties.
p29
aVThe behavior of the system as a whole
p30
aVcannot be predicted
p31
aVfrom the individual rules only.
p32
aVAs Aristotle wrote,
p33
aVthe whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
p34
aVBut from Aristotle, let's move onto
p35
aVa more concrete example of complex systems.
p36
aa(lp37
VThese are Scottish terriers.
p38
aVIn the beginning, the system is disorganized.
p39
aVThen comes a perturbation: milk.
p40
aVEvery individual starts pushing in one direction
p41
aVand this is what happens.
p42
aVThe pinwheel is an emergent property
p43
aVof the interactions between puppies
p44
aVwhose only rule is to try to keep access to the milk
p45
aVand therefore to push in a random direction.
p46
aa(lp47
VSo it's all about finding the simple rules
p48
aVfrom which complexity emerges.
p49
aVI call this simplifying complexity,
p50
aVand it's what we do at the chair of systems design
p51
aVat ETH Zurich.
p52
aVWe collect data on animal populations,
p53
aVanalyze complex patterns, try to explain them.
p54
aVIt requires physicists who work with biologists,
p55
aVwith mathematicians and computer scientists,
p56
aVand it is their interaction that produces
p57
aVcross-boundary competence
p58
aVto solve these problems.
p59
aVSo again, the whole is greater
p60
aVthan the sum of the parts.
p61
aVIn a way, collaboration
p62
aVis another example of a complex system.
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd you may be asking yourself
p65
aVwhich side I'm on, biology or physics?
p66
aVIn fact, it's a little different,
p67
aVand to explain, I need to tell you
p68
aVa short story about myself.
p69
aVWhen I was a child,
p70
aVI loved to build stuff, to create complicated machines.
p71
aVSo I set out to study electrical engineering
p72
aVand robotics,
p73
aVand my end-of-studies project
p74
aVwas about building a robot called ER-1 \u2014
p75
aVit looked like this\u2014
p76
aVthat would collect information from its environment
p77
aVand proceed to follow a white line on the ground.
p78
aVIt was very, very complicated,
p79
aVbut it worked beautifully in our test room,
p80
aVand on demo day, professors had  assembled to grade the project.
p81
aVSo we took ER-1 to the evaluation room.
p82
aVIt turned out, the light in that room
p83
aVwas slightly different.
p84
aVThe robot's vision system got confused.
p85
aVAt the first bend in the line,
p86
aVit left its course, and crashed into a wall.
p87
aVWe had spent weeks building it,
p88
aVand all it took to destroy it
p89
aVwas a subtle change in the color of the light
p90
aVin the room.
p91
aVThat's when I realized that
p92
aVthe more complicated you make a machine,
p93
aVthe more likely that it will fail
p94
aVdue to something absolutely unexpected.
p95
aVAnd I decided that, in fact,
p96
aVI didn't really want to create complicated stuff.
p97
aVI wanted to understand complexity,
p98
aVthe complexity of the world around us
p99
aVand especially in the animal kingdom.
p100
aa(lp101
VWhich brings us to bats.
p102
aVBechstein's bats are a common species of European bats.
p103
aVThey are very social animals.
p104
aVMostly they roost, or sleep, together.
p105
aVAnd they live in maternity colonies,
p106
aVwhich means that every spring,
p107
aVthe females meet after the winter hibernation,
p108
aVand they stay together for about six months
p109
aVto rear their young,
p110
aVand they all carry a very small chip,
p111
aVwhich means that every time one of them
p112
aVenters one of these specially equipped bat boxes,
p113
aVwe know where she is,
p114
aVand more importantly,
p115
aVwe know with whom she is.
p116
aVSo I study roosting associations in bats,
p117
aVand this is what it looks like.
p118
aVDuring the day, the bats roost
p119
aVin a number of sub-groups in different boxes.
p120
aVIt could be that on one day,
p121
aVthe colony is split between two boxes,
p122
aVbut on another day,
p123
aVit could be together in a single box,
p124
aVor split between three or more boxes,
p125
aVand that all seems rather erratic, really.
p126
aVIt's called fission-fusion dynamics,
p127
aVthe property for an animal group
p128
aVof regularly splitting and merging
p129
aVinto different subgroups.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo what we do is take all these data
p132
aVfrom all these different days
p133
aVand pool them together
p134
aVto extract a long-term association pattern
p135
aVby applying techniques with network analysis
p136
aVto get a complete picture
p137
aVof the social structure of the colony.
p138
aVOkay? So that's what this picture looks like.
p139
aVIn this network, all the circles
p140
aVare nodes, individual bats,
p141
aVand the lines between them
p142
aVare social bonds, associations between individuals.
p143
aVIt turns out this is a very interesting picture.
p144
aVThis bat colony is organized
p145
aVin two different communities
p146
aVwhich cannot be predicted
p147
aVfrom the daily fission-fusion dynamics.
p148
aVWe call them cryptic social units.
p149
aVEven more interesting, in fact:
p150
aVEvery year, around October,
p151
aVthe colony splits up,
p152
aVand all bats hibernate separately,
p153
aVbut year after year,
p154
aVwhen the bats come together again in the spring,
p155
aVthe communities stay the same.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo these bats remember their friends
p158
aVfor a really long time.
p159
aVWith a brain the size of a peanut,
p160
aVthey maintain individualized,
p161
aVlong-term social bonds,
p162
aVWe didn't know that was possible.
p163
aVWe knew that primates
p164
aVand elephants and dolphins could do that,
p165
aVbut compared to bats, they have huge brains.
p166
aVSo how could it be
p167
aVthat the bats maintain this complex,
p168
aVstable social structure
p169
aVwith such limited cognitive abilities?
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd this is where complexity brings an answer.
p172
aVTo understand this system,
p173
aVwe built a computer model of roosting,
p174
aVbased on simple, individual rules,
p175
aVand simulated thousands and thousands of days
p176
aVin the virtual bat colony.
p177
aVIt's a mathematical model,
p178
aVbut it's not complicated.
p179
aVWhat the model told us is that, in a nutshell,
p180
aVeach bat knows a few other colony members
p181
aVas her friends, and is just slightly more likely
p182
aVto roost in a box with them.
p183
aVSimple, individual rules.
p184
aVThis is all it takes to explain
p185
aVthe social complexity of these bats.
p186
aa(lp187
VBut it gets better.
p188
aVBetween 2010 and 2011,
p189
aVthe colony lost more than two thirds of its members,
p190
aVprobably due to the very cold winter.
p191
aVThe next spring, it didn't form two communities
p192
aVlike every year,
p193
aVwhich may have led the whole colony to die
p194
aVbecause it had become too small.
p195
aVInstead, it formed a single, cohesive social unit,
p196
aVwhich allowed the colony to survive that season
p197
aVand thrive again in the next two years.
p198
aVWhat we know is that the bats
p199
aVare not aware that their colony is doing this.
p200
aVAll they do is follow simple association rules,
p201
aVand from this simplicity
p202
aVemerges social complexity
p203
aVwhich allows the colony to be resilient
p204
aVagainst dramatic changes in the population structure.
p205
aVAnd I find this incredible.
p206
aa(lp207
VNow I want to tell you another story,
p208
aVbut for this we have to travel from Europe
p209
aVto the Kalahari Desert in South Africa.
p210
aVThis is where meerkats live.
p211
aVI'm sure you know meerkats.
p212
aVThey're fascinating creatures.
p213
aVThey live in groups with a very strict social hierarchy.
p214
aVThere is one dominant pair,
p215
aVand many subordinates,
p216
aVsome acting as sentinels,
p217
aVsome acting as babysitters,
p218
aVsome teaching pups, and so on.
p219
aVWhat we do is put very small GPS collars
p220
aVon these animals
p221
aVto study how they move together,
p222
aVand what this has to do with their social structure.
p223
aVAnd there's a very interesting example
p224
aVof collective movement in meerkats.
p225
aVIn the middle of the reserve which they live in
p226
aVlies a road.
p227
aVOn this road there are cars, so it's dangerous.
p228
aVBut the meerkats have to cross it
p229
aVto get from one feeding place to another.
p230
aVSo we asked, how exactly do they do this?
p231
aVWe found that the dominant female
p232
aVis mostly the one who leads the group to the road,
p233
aVbut when it comes to crossing it, crossing the road,
p234
aVshe gives way to the subordinates,
p235
aVa manner of saying,
p236
aV"Go ahead, tell me if it's safe."
p237
aVWhat I didn't know, in fact,
p238
aVwas what rules in their behavior the meerkats follow
p239
aVfor this change at the edge of the group to happen
p240
aVand if simple rules were sufficient to explain it.
p241
aa(lp242
VSo I built a model, a model of simulated meerkats
p243
aVcrossing a simulated road.
p244
aVIt's a simplistic model.
p245
aVMoving meerkats are like random particles
p246
aVwhose unique rule is one of alignment.
p247
aVThey simply move together.
p248
aVWhen these particles get to the road,
p249
aVthey sense some kind of obstacle,
p250
aVand they bounce against it.
p251
aVThe only difference
p252
aVbetween the dominant female, here in red,
p253
aVand the other individuals,
p254
aVis that for her, the height of the obstacle,
p255
aVwhich is in fact the risk perceived from the road,
p256
aVis just slightly higher,
p257
aVand this tiny difference
p258
aVin the individual's rule of movement
p259
aVis sufficient to explain what we observe,
p260
aVthat the dominant female
p261
aVleads her group to the road
p262
aVand then gives way to the others
p263
aVfor them to cross first.
p264
aVGeorge Box, who was an English statistician,
p265
aVonce wrote, "All models are false,
p266
aVbut some models are useful."
p267
aVAnd in fact, this model is obviously false,
p268
aVbecause in reality, meerkats are anything but random particles.
p269
aVBut it's also useful,
p270
aVbecause it tells us that extreme simplicity
p271
aVin movement rules at the individual level
p272
aVcan result in a great deal of complexity
p273
aVat the level of the group.
p274
aVSo again, that's simplifying complexity.
p275
aa(lp276
VI would like to conclude
p277
aVon what this means for the whole species.
p278
aVWhen the dominant female
p279
aVgives way to a subordinate,
p280
aVit's not out of courtesy.
p281
aVIn fact, the dominant female
p282
aVis extremely important for the cohesion of the group.
p283
aVIf she dies on the road, the whole group is at risk.
p284
aVSo this behavior of risk avoidance
p285
aVis a very old evolutionary response.
p286
aVThese meerkats are replicating an evolved tactic
p287
aVthat is thousands of generations old,
p288
aVand they're adapting it to a modern risk,
p289
aVin this case a road built by humans.
p290
aVThey adapt very simple rules,
p291
aVand the resulting complex behavior
p292
aVallows them to resist human encroachment
p293
aVinto their natural habitat.
p294
aa(lp295
VIn the end,
p296
aVit may be bats which change their social structure
p297
aVin response to a population crash,
p298
aVor it may be meerkats
p299
aVwho show a novel adaptation to a human road,
p300
aVor it may be another species.
p301
aVMy message here \u2014 and it's not a complicated one,
p302
aVbut a simple one of wonder and hope \u2014
p303
aVmy message here is that animals
p304
aVshow extraordinary social complexity,
p305
aVand this allows them to adapt
p306
aVand respond to changes in their environment.
p307
aVIn three words, in the animal kingdom,
p308
aVsimplicity leads to complexity
p309
aVwhich leads to resilience.
p310
aa(lp311

p314
aVDania Gerhardt: Thank you very much, Nicolas,
p315
aVfor this great start. Little bit nervous?
p316
aVNicolas Perony: I'm okay, thanks.
p317
aVDG: Okay, great. I'm sure a  lot of people in the audience
p318
aVsomehow tried to make associations
p319
aVbetween the animals you were talking about \u2014
p320
aVthe bats, meerkats \u2014 and humans.
p321
aVYou brought some examples:
p322
aVThe females are the social ones,
p323
aVthe females are the dominant ones,
p324
aVI'm not sure who thinks how.
p325
aVBut is it okay to do these associations?
p326
aVAre there stereotypes you can confirm in this regard
p327
aVthat can be valid across all species?
p328
aVNP: Well, I would say there are also
p329
aVcounter-examples to these stereotypes.
p330
aVFor examples, in sea horses or in koalas, in fact,
p331
aVit is the males who take care of the young always.
p332
aVAnd the lesson is that it's often difficult,
p333
aVand sometimes even a bit dangerous,
p334
aVto draw parallels between humans and animals.
p335
aVSo that's it.
p336
aVDG: Okay. Thank you very much for this great start.
p337
