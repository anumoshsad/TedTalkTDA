VOne billion people in the world today
p4
aVdo not have access to all-season roads.
p5
aVOne billion people.
p6
aVOne seventh of the Earth's population
p7
aVare totally cut off for some part of the year.
p8
aVWe cannot get medicine to them reliably,
p9
aVthey cannot get critical supplies,
p10
aVand they cannot get their goods to market
p11
aVin order to create a sustainable income.
p12
aVIn sub-Saharan Africa, for instance,
p13
aV85 percent of roads are unusable in the wet season.
p14
aVInvestments are being made,
p15
aVbut at the current level,
p16
aVit's estimated it's going to take them
p17
aV50 years to catch up.
p18
aVIn the U.S. alone, there's more than four million
p19
aVmiles of roads, very expensive to build,
p20
aVvery expensive to maintain infrastructure,
p21
aVwith a huge ecological footprint,
p22
aVand yet, very often, congested.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo we saw this and we thought,
p25
aVcan there be a better way?
p26
aVCan we create a system using today's most advanced technologies
p27
aVthat can allow this part of the world to leapfrog
p28
aVin the same way they've done with mobile telephones
p29
aVin the last 10 years?
p30
aVMany of those nations have excellent telecommunications today
p31
aVwithout ever putting copper lines in the ground.
p32
aVCould we do the same for transportation?
p33
aa(lp34
VImagine this scenario.
p35
aVImagine you are in a maternity ward in Mali,
p36
aVand have a newborn in need of urgent medication.
p37
aVWhat would you do today?
p38
aVWell, you would place a request via mobile phone,
p39
aVand someone would get the request immediately.
p40
aVThat's the part that works.
p41
aVThe medication may take days to arrive, though,
p42
aVbecause of bad roads.
p43
aVThat's the part that's broken.
p44
aa(lp45
VWe believe we can deliver it within hours
p46
aVwith an electric autonomous flying vehicle
p47
aVsuch as this.
p48
aVThis can transport a small payload today, about two kilograms,
p49
aVover a short distance, about 10 kilometers,
p50
aVbut it's part of a wider network that may cover
p51
aVthe entire country, maybe even the entire continent.
p52
aVIt's an ultra-flexible, automated logistics network.
p53
aVIt's a network for a transportation of matter.
p54
aVWe call it Matternet.
p55
aa(lp56
VWe use three key technologies.
p57
aVThe first is electric autonomous flying vehicles.
p58
aVThe second is automated ground stations
p59
aVthat the vehicles fly in and out of
p60
aVto swap batteries and fly farther,
p61
aVor pick up or deliver loads.
p62
aVAnd the third is the operating system
p63
aVthat manages the whole network.
p64
aa(lp65
VLet's look at each one of those technologies in a bit more detail.
p66
aVFirst of all, the UAVs.
p67
aVEventually, we're going to be using all sorts of vehicles
p68
aVfor different payload capacities and different ranges.
p69
aVToday, we're using small quads.
p70
aVThese are able to transport two kilograms
p71
aVover 10 kilometers in just about 15 minutes.
p72
aVCompare this with trying to trespass a bad road
p73
aVin the developing world,
p74
aVor even being stuck in traffic
p75
aVin a developed world country.
p76
aVThese fly autonomously.
p77
aVThis is the key to the technology.
p78
aVSo they use GPS and other sensors on board
p79
aVto navigate between ground stations.
p80
aVEvery vehicle is equipped with an automatic
p81
aVpayload and battery exchange mechanism,
p82
aVso these vehicles navigate to those ground stations,
p83
aVthey dock, swap a battery automatically,
p84
aVand go out again.
p85
aVThe ground stations are located on safe locations
p86
aVon the ground.
p87
aVThey secure the most vulnerable part of the mission,
p88
aVwhich is the landing.
p89
aVThey are at known locations on the ground,
p90
aVso the paths between them are also known,
p91
aVwhich is very important from a reliability perspective
p92
aVfrom the whole network.
p93
aVApart from fulfilling the energy requirements of the vehicles,
p94
aVeventually they're going to be becoming
p95
aVcommercial hubs where people can take out loads
p96
aVor put loads into the network.
p97
aVThe last component is the operating system
p98
aVthat manages the whole network.
p99
aVIt monitors weather data from all the ground stations
p100
aVand optimizes the routes of the vehicles through the system
p101
aVto avoid adverse weather conditions,
p102
aVavoid other risk factors,
p103
aVand optimize the use of the resources
p104
aVthroughout the network.
p105
aa(lp106
VI want to show you what one of those flights
p107
aVlooks like.
p108
aVHere we are flying in Haiti last summer,
p109
aVwhere we've done our first field trials.
p110
aVWe're modeling here a medical delivery
p111
aVin a camp we set up after the 2010 earthquake.
p112
aVPeople there love this.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd I want to show you
p115
aVwhat one of those vehicles looks like up close.
p116
aVSo this is a $3,000 vehicle.
p117
aVCosts are coming down very rapidly.
p118
aVWe use this in all sorts of weather conditions,
p119
aVvery hot and very cold climates,
p120
aVvery strong winds. They're very sturdy vehicles.
p121
aVImagine if your life depended on this package,
p122
aVsomewhere in Africa
p123
aVor in New York City, after Sandy.
p124
aVThe next big question is, what's the cost?
p125
aa(lp126
VWell, it turns out that the cost to transport
p127
aVtwo kilograms over 10 kilometers with this vehicle
p128
aVis just 24 cents.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Applause)
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd it's counterintuitive, but the cost of energy
p133
aVexpended for the flight is only two cents
p134
aVof a dollar today,
p135
aVand we're just at the beginning of this.
p136
aVWhen we saw this, we felt that this is something
p137
aVthat can have significant impact in the world.
p138
aa(lp139
VSo we said, okay, how much does it cost
p140
aVto set up a network somewhere in the world?
p141
aVAnd we looked at setting up a network in Lesotho
p142
aVfor transportation of HIV/AIDS samples.
p143
aVThe problem there is how do you take them
p144
aVfrom clinics where they're being collected
p145
aVto hospitals where they're being analyzed?
p146
aVAnd we said, what if we wanted to cover an area
p147
aVspanning around 140 square kilometers?
p148
aVThat's roughly one and a half times the size of Manhattan.
p149
aVWell it turns out that the cost to do that there
p150
aVwould be less than a million dollars.
p151
aVCompare this to normal infrastructure investments.
p152
aVWe think this can be \u2014 this is the power
p153
aVof a new paradigm.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo here we are: a new idea
p156
aVabout a network for transportation
p157
aVthat is based on the ideas of the Internet.
p158
aVIt's decentralized, it's peer-to-peer,
p159
aVit's bidirectional, highly adaptable,
p160
aVwith very low infrastructure investment,
p161
aVvery low ecological footprint.
p162
aVIf it is a new paradigm, though,
p163
aVthere must be other uses for it.
p164
aVIt can be used perhaps in other places in the world.
p165
aa(lp166
VSo let's look at the other end of the spectrum:
p167
aVour cities and megacities.
p168
aVHalf of the Earth's population lives in cities today.
p169
aVHalf a billion of us live in megacities.
p170
aVWe are living through an amazing urbanization trend.
p171
aVChina alone is adding a megacity
p172
aVthe size of New York City every two years.
p173
aVThese are places that do have road infrastructure,
p174
aVbut it's very inefficient.
p175
aVCongestion is a huge problem.
p176
aVSo we think it makes sense in those places
p177
aVto set up a network of transportation
p178
aVthat is a new layer that sits between the road
p179
aVand the Internet,
p180
aVinitially for lightweight, urgent stuff,
p181
aVand over time, we would hope to develop this
p182
aVinto a new mode of transportation
p183
aVthat is truly a modern solution to a very old problem.
p184
aVIt's ultimately scalable
p185
aVwith a very small ecological footprint,
p186
aVoperating in the background 24/7,
p187
aVjust like the Internet.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo when we started this
p190
aVa couple of years ago now,
p191
aVwe've had a lot of people come up to us who said,
p192
aV"This is a very interesting but crazy idea,
p193
aVand certainly not something that you should
p194
aVengage with anytime soon."
p195
aVAnd of course, we're talking about drones, right,
p196
aVa technology that's not only unpopular in the West
p197
aVbut one that has become a very, very unpleasant
p198
aVfact of life for many living in poor countries,
p199
aVespecially those engaged in conflict.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo why are we doing this?
p202
aVWell, we chose to do this one
p203
aVnot because it's easy,
p204
aVbut because it can have amazing impact.
p205
aVImagine one billion people being connected
p206
aVto physical goods in the same way
p207
aVthat mobile telecommunications connected them
p208
aVto information.
p209
aVImagine if the next big network we built in the world
p210
aVwas a network for the transportation of matter.
p211
aVIn the developing world, we would hope
p212
aVto reach millions of people with better vaccines,
p213
aVreach them with better medication.
p214
aVIt would give us an unfair advantage against battling
p215
aVHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other epidemics.
p216
aVOver time, we would hope it would become
p217
aVa new platform for economic transactions,
p218
aVlifting millions of people out of poverty.
p219
aVIn the developed world and the emerging world,
p220
aVwe would hope it would become a new mode
p221
aVof transportation that could help make our cities
p222
aVmore livable.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo for those that still believe that this is science fiction,
p225
aVI firmly say to you that it is not.
p226
aVWe do need to engage, though,
p227
aVin social fiction to make it happen.
p228
aa(lp229
VThank you.
