VThis is the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam,
p4
aVwhere I work as a curator.
p5
aVIt's my job to make sure the collection stays okay,
p6
aVand that it grows,
p7
aVand basically it means I collect dead animals.
p8
aVBack in 1995,
p9
aVwe got a new wing next to the museum.
p10
aVIt was made of glass,
p11
aVand this building really helped me to do my job good.
p12
aVThe building was a true bird-killer.
p13
aVYou may know that birds don't understand
p14
aVthe concept of glass. They don't see it,
p15
aVso they fly into the windows and get killed.
p16
aVThe only thing I had to do was go out,
p17
aVpick them up, and have them stuffed for the collection.
p18
aV(Laughter)
p19
aVAnd in those days,
p20
aVI developed an ear to identify birds
p21
aVjust by the sound of the bangs they made against the glass.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd it was on June 5, 1995,
p24
aVthat I heard a loud bang against the glass
p25
aVthat changed my life and ended that of a duck.
p26
aVAnd this is what I saw when I looked out of the window.
p27
aVThis is the dead duck. It flew against the window.
p28
aVIt's laying dead on its belly.
p29
aVBut next to the dead duck is a live duck,
p30
aVand please pay attention.
p31
aVBoth are of the male sex.
p32
aVAnd then this happened.
p33
aVThe live duck mounted the dead duck,
p34
aVand started to copulate.
p35
aa(lp36
VWell, I'm a biologist. I'm an ornithologist.
p37
aVI said, "Something's wrong here."
p38
aVOne is dead, one is alive. That must be necrophilia.
p39
aVI look. Both are of the male sex.
p40
aVHomosexual necrophilia.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo I \u2014 (Laughter)
p43
aa(lp44
VI took my camera, I took my notebook,
p45
aVtook a chair, and started to observe this behavior.
p46
aVAfter 75 minutes \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p47
aVI had seen enough, and I got hungry,
p48
aVand I wanted to go home.
p49
aVSo I went out, collected the duck,
p50
aVand before I put it in the freezer,
p51
aVI checked if the victim was indeed of the male sex.
p52
aVAnd here's a rare picture of a duck's penis,
p53
aVso it was indeed of the male sex.
p54
aVIt's a rare picture because there are 10,000 species of birds
p55
aVand only 300 possess a penis.
p56
aa(lp57
V[The first case of homosexual necrophilia in the mallard Anas platyrhynchos (Aves:Anatidae)]
p58
aa(lp59
VI knew I'd seen something special,
p60
aVbut it took me six years to decide to publish it.
p61
aV(Laughter)
p62
aVI mean, it's a nice topic for a birthday party
p63
aVor at the coffee machine,
p64
aVbut to share this among your peers is something different.
p65
aVI didn't have the framework.
p66
aVSo after six years, my friends and colleagues urged me to publish,
p67
aVso I published "The first case of homosexual necrophilia
p68
aVin the mallard."
p69
aVAnd here's the situation again.
p70
aVA is my office,
p71
aVB is the place where the duck hit the glass,
p72
aVand C is from where I watched it.
p73
aVAnd here are the ducks again.
p74
aa(lp75
VAs you probably know, in science,
p76
aVwhen you write a kind of special paper,
p77
aVonly six or seven people read it.
p78
aV(Laughter)
p79
aVBut then something good happened.
p80
aVI got a phone call from a person called Marc Abrahams,
p81
aVand he told me, "You've won a prize with your duck paper:
p82
aVthe Ig Nobel Prize."
p83
aVAnd the Ig Nobel Prize \u2014
p84
aV(Laughter) (Applause) \u2014
p85
aVthe Ig Nobel Prize honors research
p86
aVthat first makes people laugh, and then makes them think,
p87
aVwith the ultimate goal to make more people
p88
aVinterested in science.
p89
aVThat's a good thing, so I accepted the prize.
p90
aV(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VI went \u2014 let me remind you that Marc Abrahams
p93
aVdidn't call me from Stockholm.
p94
aVHe called me from Cambridge, Massachusetts.
p95
aVSo I traveled to Boston, to Cambridge,
p96
aVand I went to this wonderful Ig Nobel Prize ceremony
p97
aVheld at Harvard University, and this ceremony
p98
aVis a very nice experience.
p99
aVReal Nobel laureates hand you the prize.
p100
aVThat's the first thing.
p101
aVAnd there are nine other winners who get prizes.
p102
aVHere's one of my fellow winners. That's Charles Paxton
p103
aVwho won the 2000 biology prize for his paper,
p104
aV"Courtship behavior of ostriches towards humans
p105
aVunder farming conditions in Britain."
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVAnd I think there are one or two more
p108
aVIg Nobel Prize winners in this room.
p109
aVDan, where are you? Dan Ariely?
p110
aVApplause for Dan.
p111
aV(Applause)
p112
aVDan won his prize in medicine
p113
aVfor demonstrating that high-priced fake medicine
p114
aVworks better than low-priced fake medicine.
p115
aV(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VSo here's my one minute of fame,
p118
aVmy acceptance speech,
p119
aVand here's the duck.
p120
aVThis is its first time on the U.S. West Coast.
p121
aVI'm going to pass it around.
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aVYeah?
p124
aVYou can pass it around.
p125
aVPlease note it's a museum specimen,
p126
aVbut there's no chance you'll get the avian flu.
p127
aa(lp128
VAfter winning this prize, my life changed.
p129
aVIn the first place, people started to send me
p130
aVall kinds of duck-related things,
p131
aVand I got a real nice collection.
p132
aV(Laughter)
p133
aVMore importantly,
p134
aVpeople started to send me their observations
p135
aVof remarkable animal behavior,
p136
aVand believe me, if there's an animal misbehaving on this planet,
p137
aVI know about it.
p138
aa(lp139
V(Laughter)
p140
aa(lp141
VThis is a moose.
p142
aVIt's a moose trying to copulate
p143
aVwith a bronze statue of a bison.
p144
aVThis is in Montana, 2008.
p145
aVThis is a frog that tries to copulate with a goldfish.
p146
aVThis is the Netherlands, 2011.
p147
aVThese are cane toads in Australia.
p148
aVThis is roadkill.
p149
aVPlease note that this is necrophilia.
p150
aVIt's remarkable: the position.
p151
aVThe missionary position is very rare in the animal kingdom.
p152
aVThese are pigeons in Rotterdam.
p153
aVBarn swallows in Hong Kong, 2004.
p154
aVThis is a turkey in Wisconsin
p155
aVon the premises of the Ethan Allen juvenile correctional institution.
p156
aVIt took all day,
p157
aVand the prisoners had a great time.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo what does this mean?
p160
aVI mean, the question I ask myself,
p161
aVwhy does this happen in nature?
p162
aVWell, what I concluded
p163
aVfrom reviewing all these cases
p164
aVis that it is important that this happens
p165
aVonly when death is instant
p166
aVand in a dramatic way
p167
aVand in the right position for copulation.
p168
aVAt least, I thought it was till I got these slides.
p169
aVAnd here you see a dead duck.
p170
aVIt's been there for three days,
p171
aVand it's laying on its back.
p172
aVSo there goes my theory of necrophilia.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnother example of the impact
p175
aVof glass buildings on the life of birds.
p176
aVThis is Mad Max, a blackbird who lives in Rotterdam.
p177
aVThe only thing this bird did was fly against this window
p178
aVfrom 2004 to 2008, day in and day out.
p179
aVHere he goes, and here's a short video.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Music) (Clunk)
p182
aV(Clunk)
p183
aV(Clunk)
p184
aV(Clunk)
p185
aa(lp186
VSo what this bird does
p187
aVis fight his own image.
p188
aVHe sees an intruder in his territory,
p189
aVand it's coming all the time and he's there,
p190
aVso there is no end to it.
p191
aVAnd I thought, in the beginning \u2014 I studied this bird for a couple of years \u2014
p192
aVthat, well, shouldn't the brain of this bird be damaged?
p193
aVIt's not. I show you here some slides,
p194
aVsome frames from the video,
p195
aVand at the last moment before he hits the glass,
p196
aVhe puts his feet in front,
p197
aVand then he bangs against the glass.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo I'll conclude to invite you all to Dead Duck Day.
p200
aVThat's on June 5 every year.
p201
aVAt five minutes to six in the afternoon,
p202
aVwe come together at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam,
p203
aVthe duck comes out of the museum,
p204
aVand we try to discuss new ways
p205
aVto prevent birds from colliding with windows.
p206
aVAnd as you know, or as you may not know,
p207
aVthis is one of the major causes of death
p208
aVfor birds in the world.
p209
aVIn the U.S. alone, a billion birds die
p210
aVin collision with glass buildings.
p211
aVAnd when it's over, we go to a Chinese restaurant
p212
aVand we have a six-course duck dinner.
p213
aa(lp214
VSo I hope to see you
p215
aVnext year in Rotterdam, the Netherlands,
p216
aVfor Dead Duck Day.
p217
aVThank you.
p218
aa(lp219
V(Applause)
p220
aa(lp221
VOh, sorry.
p222
aVMay I have my duck back, please?
p223
aa(lp224
V(Laughter) (Applause)
p225
aa(lp226
VThank you.
