VI thought I would start with a very brief history of cities.
p4
aVSettlements typically began with people clustered around a well,
p5
aVand the size of that settlement was roughly the distance you could walk
p6
aVwith a pot of water on your head.
p7
aVIn fact, if you fly over Germany, for example,
p8
aVand you look down and you see these hundreds of little villages,
p9
aVthey're all about a mile apart.
p10
aVYou needed easy access to the fields.
p11
aVAnd for hundreds, even thousands of years,
p12
aVthe home was really the center of life.
p13
aVLife was very small for most people.
p14
aVIt was a center of entertainment, of energy production, of work,
p15
aVa center of health care.
p16
aVThat's where babies were born and people died.
p17
aa(lp18
VThen, with industrialization, everything started to become centralized.
p19
aVYou had dirty factories that were moved to the outskirts of cities.
p20
aVProduction was centralized in assembly plants.
p21
aVYou had centralized energy production.
p22
aVLearning took place in schools.
p23
aVHealth care took place in hospitals.
p24
aVAnd then you had networks that developed.
p25
aVYou had water, sewer networks
p26
aVthat allowed for this kind of unchecked expansion.
p27
aVYou had separated functions, increasingly.
p28
aVYou had rail networks
p29
aVthat connected residential, industrial, commercial areas.
p30
aVYou had auto networks.
p31
aVIn fact, the model was really, give everybody a car,
p32
aVbuild roads to everything,
p33
aVand give people a place to park when they get there.
p34
aVIt was not a very functional model.
p35
aVAnd we still live in that world,
p36
aVand this is what we end up with.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo you have the sprawl of LA,
p39
aVthe sprawl of Mexico City.
p40
aVYou have these unbelievable new cities in China,
p41
aVwhich you might call tower sprawl.
p42
aVThey're all building cities
p43
aVon the model that we invented in the '50s and '60s,
p44
aVwhich is really obsolete, I would argue,
p45
aVand there are hundreds and hundreds of new cities
p46
aVthat are being planned all over the world.
p47
aVIn China alone, 300 million people, some say 400 million people,
p48
aVwill move to the city over the next 15 years.
p49
aVThat means building the equivalent
p50
aVof the entire built infrastructure of the US in 15 years.
p51
aVImagine that.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd we should all care about this whether you live in cities or not.
p54
aVCities will account for 90 percent of the population growth,
p55
aV80 percent of the global CO2, 75 percent of energy use,
p56
aVbut at the same time it's where people want to be,
p57
aVincreasingly.
p58
aVMore than half the people now in the world live in cities,
p59
aVand that will just continue to escalate.
p60
aa(lp61
VCities are places of celebration, personal expression.
p62
aVYou have the flash mobs of pillow fights that \u2014
p63
aVI've been to a couple. They're quite fun.
p64
aVYou have \u2014
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VCities are where most of the wealth is created,
p69
aVand particularly in the developing world, it's where women find opportunities.
p70
aVThat's a lot of the reason why cities are growing very quickly.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow there's some trends that will impact cities.
p73
aVFirst of all, work is becoming distributed and mobile.
p74
aVThe office building is basically obsolete for doing private work.
p75
aVThe home, once again, because of distributed computation \u2014
p76
aVCommunication is becoming a center of life,
p77
aVso it's a center of production and learning and shopping and health care
p78
aVand all of these things that we used to think of
p79
aVas taking place outside of the home.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd increasingly, everything that people buy,
p82
aVevery consumer product,
p83
aVin one way or another, can be personalized.
p84
aVAnd that's a very important trend to think about.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo this is my image of the city of the future.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VIn that it's a place for people, you know.
p91
aVMaybe not the way people dress, but \u2014
p92
aVYou know, the question now is,
p93
aVhow can we have all the good things that we identify with cities
p94
aVwithout all the bad things?
p95
aa(lp96
VThis is Bangalore.
p97
aVIt took me a couple of hours to get a few miles in Bangalore last year.
p98
aVSo with cities, you also have congestion and pollution
p99
aVand disease and all these negative things.
p100
aVHow can we have the good stuff without the bad?
p101
aa(lp102
VSo we went back and started looking at the great cities
p103
aVthat evolved before the cars.
p104
aVParis was a series of these little villages that came together,
p105
aVand you still see that structure today.
p106
aVThe 20 arrondissements of Paris are these little neighborhoods.
p107
aVMost of what people need in life can be within a five- or 10-minute walk.
p108
aVAnd if you look at the data, when you have that kind of a structure,
p109
aVyou get a very even distribution
p110
aVof the shops and the physicians and the pharmacies
p111
aVand the cafes in Paris.
p112
aVAnd then you look at cities that evolved after the automobile,
p113
aVand it's not that kind of a pattern.
p114
aVThere's very little that's within a five-minute walk
p115
aVof most areas of places like Pittsburgh.
p116
aVNot to pick on Pittsburgh,
p117
aVbut most American cities really have evolved this way.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo we said, well, let's look at new cities,
p120
aVand we're involved in a couple of new city projects in China.
p121
aVSo we said, let's start with that neighborhood cell.
p122
aVWe think of it as a compact urban cell.
p123
aVSo provide most of what most people want within that 20-minute walk.
p124
aVThis can also be a resilient electrical microgrid,
p125
aVcommunity heating, power, communication networks, etc.
p126
aVcan be concentrated there.
p127
aVStewart Brand would put a micronuclear reactor
p128
aVright in the center, probably.
p129
aVAnd he might be right.
p130
aVAnd then we can form, in effect, a mesh network.
p131
aVIt's something of an Internet typology pattern,
p132
aVso you can have a series of these neighborhoods.
p133
aVYou can dial up the density \u2014
p134
aVabout 20,000 people per cell, if it's Cambridge.
p135
aVGo up to 50,000 if it's Manhattan density.
p136
aVYou connect everything with mass transit
p137
aVand you provide most of what most people need within that neighborhood.
p138
aVYou can begin to develop a whole typology of streetscapes
p139
aVand the vehicles that can go on them.
p140
aVI won't go through all of them. I'll just show one.
p141
aa(lp142
VThis is Boulder. It's a great example of kind of a mobility parkway,
p143
aVa superhighway for joggers and bicyclists,
p144
aVwhere you can go from one end of the city to the other
p145
aVwithout crossing the street,
p146
aVand they also have bike-sharing, which I'll get into in a minute.
p147
aa(lp148
VThis is even a more interesting solution
p149
aVin Seoul, Korea.
p150
aVThey took the elevated highway, they got rid of it,
p151
aVthey reclaimed the street, the river down below,
p152
aVbelow the street,
p153
aVand you can go from one end of Seoul to the other
p154
aVwithout crossing a pathway for cars.
p155
aa(lp156
VThe High Line in Manhattan is very similar.
p157
aVYou have these rapidly emerging bike lanes all over the world.
p158
aVI lived in Manhattan for 15 years.
p159
aVI went back a couple of weekends ago,
p160
aVtook this photograph of these fabulous new bike lanes that they have installed.
p161
aVThey're still not to where Copenhagen is,
p162
aVwhere something like 42 percent of the trips within the city
p163
aVare by bicycle.
p164
aVIt's mostly just because they have fantastic infrastructure there.
p165
aa(lp166
VWe actually did exactly the wrong thing in Boston.
p167
aVThe Big Dig \u2014
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VSo we got rid of the highway but we created a traffic island,
p172
aVand it's certainly not a mobility pathway for anything other than cars.
p173
aa(lp174
VMobility on demand is something we've been thinking about,
p175
aVso we think we need an ecosystem of these shared-use vehicles
p176
aVconnected to mass transit.
p177
aVThese are some of the vehicles that we've been working on.
p178
aVBut shared use is really key.
p179
aVIf you share a vehicle, you can have at least four people use one vehicle,
p180
aVas opposed to one.
p181
aVWe have Hubway here in Boston, the Vélib' system in Paris.
p182
aa(lp183
VWe've been developing, at the Media Lab, this little city car
p184
aVthat is optimized for shared use in cities.
p185
aVWe got rid of all the useless things like engines and transmissions.
p186
aVWe moved everything to the wheels,
p187
aVso you have the drive motor,
p188
aVthe steering motor, the breaking \u2014 all in the wheel.
p189
aVThat left the chassis unencumbered, so you can do things like fold,
p190
aVso you can fold this little vehicle up to occupy a tiny little footprint.
p191
aa(lp192
VThis was a video that was on European television last week
p193
aVshowing the Spanish Minister of Industry driving this little vehicle,
p194
aVand when it's folded, it can spin.
p195
aVYou don't need reverse. You don't need parallel parking.
p196
aVYou just spin and go directly in.
p197
aa(lp198
V(Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VSo we've been working with a company to commercialize this.
p201
aVMy PhD student Ryan Chin presented these early ideas
p202
aVtwo years ago at a TEDx conference.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo what's interesting is,
p205
aVthen if you begin to add new things to it, like autonomy,
p206
aVyou get out of the car, you park at your destination,
p207
aVyou pat it on the butt, it goes and it parks itself, it charges itself,
p208
aVand you can get something like seven times as many vehicles
p209
aVin a given area as conventional cars,
p210
aVand we think this is the future.
p211
aVActually, we could do this today. It's not really a problem.
p212
aVWe can combine shared use and folding and autonomy
p213
aVand we get something like 28 times the land utilization
p214
aVwith that kind of strategy.
p215
aa(lp216
VOne of our graduate students then says,
p217
aVwell, how does a driverless car communicate with pedestrians?
p218
aVYou have nobody to make eye contact with.
p219
aVYou don't know if it's going to run you over.
p220
aVSo he's developing strategies
p221
aVso the vehicle can communicate with pedestrians, so \u2014
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VSo the headlights are eyeballs, the pupils can dilate,
p226
aVwe have directional audio, we can throw sound directly at people.
p227
aVWhat I love about this project
p228
aVis he solved a problem that doesn't exist yet, so \u2014
p229
aa(lp230
V(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
VWe also think that we can democratize access to bike lanes.
p233
aVYou know, bike lanes are mostly used by young guys in stretchy pants. So \u2014
p234
aa(lp235
V(Laughter)
p236
aa(lp237
VWe think we can develop a vehicle that operates on bike lanes,
p238
aVaccessible to elderly and disabled, women in skirts, businesspeople,
p239
aVand address the issues of energy congestion, mobility,
p240
aVaging and obesity simultaneously.
p241
aVThat's our challenge.
p242
aa(lp243
VThis is an early design for this little three-wheel.
p244
aVIt's an electronic bike.
p245
aVYou have to pedal to operate it in a bike lane,
p246
aVbut if you're an older person, that's a switch.
p247
aVIf you're a healthy person, you might have to work really hard to go fast.
p248
aVYou can dial in 40 calories going into work
p249
aVand 500 going home, when you can take a shower.
p250
aVWe hope to have that built this fall.
p251
aa(lp252
VHousing is another area where we can really improve.
p253
aVMayor Menino in Boston says
p254
aVlack of affordable housing for young people
p255
aVis one of the biggest problems the city faces.
p256
aVDevelopers say, OK, we'll build little teeny apartments.
p257
aVPeople say, we don't really want to live in a little teeny conventional apartment.
p258
aVSo we're saying, let's build a standardized chassis,
p259
aVmuch like our car.
p260
aVLet's bring advanced technology into the apartment,
p261
aVtechnology-enabled infill,
p262
aVgive people the tools within this open-loft chassis
p263
aVto go through a process of defining
p264
aVwhat their needs and values and activities are,
p265
aVand then a matching algorithm will match a unique assembly
p266
aVof integrated infill components,
p267
aVfurniture, and cabinetry, that are personalized to that individual,
p268
aVand they give them the tools
p269
aVto go through the process and to refine it,
p270
aVand it's something like working with an architect,
p271
aVwhere the dialogue starts
p272
aVwhen you give an alternative to a person to react to.
p273
aa(lp274
VNow, the most interesting implementation of that for us
p275
aVis when you can begin to have robotic walls,
p276
aVso your space can convert from exercise to a workplace,
p277
aVif you run a virtual company.
p278
aVYou have guests over,
p279
aVyou have two guest rooms that are developed.
p280
aVYou have a conventional one-bedroom arrangement
p281
aVwhen you need it.
p282
aVMaybe that's most of the time.
p283
aVYou have a dinner party.
p284
aVThe table folds out to fit 16 people in otherwise a conventional one-bedroom,
p285
aVor maybe you want a dance studio.
p286
aVI mean, architects have been thinking about these ideas for a long time.
p287
aVWhat we need to do now,
p288
aVdevelop things that can scale to those 300 million Chinese people
p289
aVthat would like to live in the city, and very comfortably.
p290
aVWe think we can make a very small apartment
p291
aVthat functions as if it's twice as big by utilizing these strategies.
p292
aVI don't believe in smart homes. That's sort of a bogus concept.
p293
aVI think you have to build dumb homes and put smart stuff in it.
p294
aa(lp295
V(Laughter)
p296
aa(lp297
VAnd so we've been working on a chassis of the wall itself.
p298
aVYou know, standardized platform
p299
aVwith the motors and the battery when it operates,
p300
aVlittle solenoids that will lock it in place and get low-voltage power.
p301
aVWe think this can all be standardized,
p302
aVand then people can personalize the stuff that goes into that wall,
p303
aVand like the car, we can integrate all kinds of sensing
p304
aVto be aware of human activity,
p305
aVso if there's a baby or a puppy in the way,
p306
aVyou won't have a problem.
p307
aa(lp308
V(Laughter)
p309
aa(lp310
VSo the developers say, well, this is great.
p311
aVOK, so if we have a conventional building, we have a fixed envelope,
p312
aVmaybe we can put in 14 units.
p313
aVIf they function as if they're twice as big,
p314
aVwe can get 28 units in.
p315
aVThat means twice as much parking, though.
p316
aVParking's really expensive.
p317
aVIt's about 70,000 dollars per space
p318
aVto build a conventional parking spot inside a building.
p319
aVSo if you can have folding and autonomy,
p320
aVyou can do that in one-seventh of the space.
p321
aVThat goes down to 10,000 dollars per car,
p322
aVjust for the cost of the parking.
p323
aVYou add shared use, and you can even go further.
p324
aa(lp325
VWe can also integrate all kinds of advanced technology
p326
aVthrough this process.
p327
aVThere's a path to market for innovative companies
p328
aVto bring technology into the home.
p329
aVIn this case, a project we're doing with Siemens.
p330
aVWe have sensors on all the furniture, all the infill,
p331
aVthat understands where people are and what they're doing.
p332
aVBlue light is very efficient,
p333
aVso we have these tunable 24-bit LED lighting fixtures.
p334
aVIt recognizes where the person is, what they're doing,
p335
aVfills out the light when necessary to full spectrum white light,
p336
aVand saves maybe 30, 40 percent in energy consumption, we think,
p337
aVover even conventional state-of-the-art lighting systems.
p338
aVThis just shows you the data that comes from the sensors
p339
aVthat are embedded in the furniture.
p340
aVWe don't really believe in cameras to do things in homes.
p341
aVWe think these little wireless sensors are more effective.
p342
aa(lp343
VWe think we can also personalize sunlight.
p344
aVThat's sort of the ultimate personalization in some ways.
p345
aVSo we've looked at articulating mirrors of the facade
p346
aVthat can throw shafts of sunlight anywhere into the space,
p347
aVtherefore allowing you to shade most of the glass
p348
aVon a hot day like today.
p349
aVIn this case, she picks up her phone,
p350
aVshe can map food preparation at the kitchen island
p351
aVto a particular location of sunlight.
p352
aVAn algorithm will keep it in that location as long as she's engaged in that activity.
p353
aVThis can be combined with LED lighting as well.
p354
aa(lp355
VWe think workplaces should be shared.
p356
aVI mean, this is really the workplace of the future, I think.
p357
aVThis is Starbucks, you know.
p358
aVMaybe a third \u2014
p359
aVAnd you see everybody has their back to the wall
p360
aVand they have food and coffee down the way
p361
aVand they're in their own little personal bubble.
p362
aVWe need shared spaces for interaction and collaboration.
p363
aVWe're not doing a very good job with that.
p364
aVAt the Cambridge Innovation Center, you can have shared desks.
p365
aVI've spent a lot of time in Finland at the design factory of Aalto University,
p366
aVwhere the they have a shared shop and shared fab lab, shared quiet spaces,
p367
aVelectronics spaces, recreation places.
p368
aa(lp369
VWe think ultimately, all of this stuff can come together,
p370
aVa new model for mobility, a new model for housing,
p371
aVa new model for how we live and work,
p372
aVa path to market for advanced technologies.
p373
aVBut in the end, the main thing we need to focus on are people.
p374
aVCities are all about people.
p375
aVThey're places for people.
p376
aVThere's no reason why we can't dramatically improve
p377
aVthe livability and creativity of cities
p378
aVlike they've done in Melbourne with the laneways
p379
aVwhile at the same time dramatically reducing CO2 and energy.
p380
aVIt's a global imperative. We have to get this right.
p381
