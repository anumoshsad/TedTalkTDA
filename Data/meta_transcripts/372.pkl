VI dabble in design. I'm a curator of architecture and design;
p4
aVI happen to be at the Museum of Modern Art.
p5
aVBut what we're going to talk about today
p6
aVis really design. Really good designers are like sponges:
p7
aVthey really are curious
p8
aVand absorb every kind of information that comes their way,
p9
aVand transform it so that it can be used by people like us.
p10
aVAnd so that gives me an opportunity,
p11
aVbecause every design show that I curate
p12
aVkind of looks at a different world. And it's great,
p13
aVbecause it seems like every time I change jobs.
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd what I'm going to do today is I'm going to give you a preview
p16
aVof the next exhibition that I'm working on, which is called
p17
aV"Design and the Elastic Mind."
p18
aVThe world that I decided to focus on this particular time
p19
aVis the world of science and the world of technology.
p20
aVTechnology always comes into play when design is involved,
p21
aVbut science does a little less.
p22
aVBut designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen
p23
aVand transforming them so that we can use them.
p24
aVAnd this is what this exhibition looks at.
p25
aa(lp26
VIf you think about your life today,
p27
aVyou go every day through many different scales,
p28
aVmany different changes of rhythm and pace.
p29
aVYou work over different time zones, you talk to very different people,
p30
aVyou multitask. We all know it, and we do it kind of automatically.
p31
aVSome of the minds in this audience are super elastic,
p32
aVothers are a little slower,
p33
aVothers have a few stretch marks, but nonetheless
p34
aVthis is a quite exceptional audience from that viewpoint.
p35
aVOther people are not as elastic.
p36
aVI can't get my father in Italy to work on the Internet.
p37
aVHe doesn't want to put high-speed Internet at home.
p38
aVAnd that's because there's some little bit of fear,
p39
aVlittle bit of resistance or just clogged mechanisms.
p40
aVSo designers work on this particular malaise that we have,
p41
aVthese kinds of discomforts that we have,
p42
aVand try to make life easier for us.
p43
aVElasticity of mind is something that we really need, you know,
p44
aVwe really need, we really cherish and we really work on.
p45
aVAnd this exhibition is about the work of designers
p46
aVthat help us be more elastic,
p47
aVand also of designers that really work on this elasticity
p48
aVas an opportunity. And one last thing is that
p49
aVit's not only designers, but it's also scientists.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd before I launch into the display of some of the slides
p52
aVand into the preview, I would like to point out
p53
aVthis beautiful detail about scientists and design.
p54
aVYou can say that the relationship between science and design
p55
aVgoes back centuries. You can of course talk about
p56
aVLeonardo da Vinci and many other Renaissance men and women \u2014
p57
aVand there's a gigantic history behind it.
p58
aVBut according to a really great science historian you might know,
p59
aVPeter Galison \u2014 he teaches at Harvard \u2014
p60
aVwhat nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics
p61
aVhave brought to designers is this renewed interest,
p62
aVthis real passion for design.
p63
aa(lp64
VSo basically, the idea of being able to build things bottom up,
p65
aVatom by atom, has made them all into tinkerers.
p66
aVAnd all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers,
p67
aVjust like designers are seeking scientists.
p68
aVIt's a brand-new love affair that we're trying to cultivate
p69
aVat MOMA. Together with Adam Bly, who is the founder of Seed magazine \u2014
p70
aVthat's now a multimedia company, you might know it \u2014
p71
aVwe founded about a year ago a monthly salon
p72
aVfor designers and scientists, and it's quite beautiful.
p73
aVAnd Keith has come, and also Jonathan has come and many others.
p74
aVAnd it was great, because at the beginning was this apology fest \u2014
p75
aVyou know, scientists would tell designers,
p76
aVyou know, I don't know what style is, I'm not really elegant.
p77
aVAnd designers would like, oh, I don't know how to do an equation,
p78
aVI don't understand what you're saying. And then all of a sudden
p79
aVthey really started talking each others' language,
p80
aVand now we're already at the point that they collaborate.
p81
aa(lp82
VPaul Steinhardt, a physicist from New York,
p83
aVand Aranda/Lasch, architects, collaborated in an installation
p84
aVin London at the Serpentine.
p85
aVAnd it's really interesting to see how this happens.
p86
aVThe exhibition will talk about the work
p87
aVof both designers and scientists,
p88
aVand show how they're presenting the possibilities of the future to us.
p89
aVI'm showing to you
p90
aVdifferent sections of the show right now,
p91
aVjust to give you a taste of it.
p92
aVNanophysics and nanotechnology, for instance,
p93
aVhave really opened the designer's mind.
p94
aVIn this case I'm showing more the designers' work,
p95
aVbecause they're the ones that have really been stimulated.
p96
aVA lot of the objects in the show are concepts,
p97
aVnot objects that exist already. But what you're looking at here
p98
aVis the work of some scientists from UCLA.
p99
aVThis kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins \u2014
p100
aVnot only by color but literally by alphabet letters.
p101
aVSo they construct it, and they can construct all kinds of forms
p102
aa(lp103
Vat the nanoscale. This is the work of design students
p104
aVfrom the Royal College of Arts in London
p105
aVthat have been working together with their tutor, Tony Dunne,
p106
aVand with a bunch of scientists around Great Britain
p107
aVon the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future.
p108
aVNew sensing elements on the body \u2014
p109
aVyou can grow hairs on your nails,
p110
aVand therefore grab some of the particles from another person.
p111
aVThey seem very, very obsessed
p112
aVwith finding out more about the ideal mate.
p113
aVSo they're working on enhancing everything: touch, smell \u2014
p114
aVeverything they can, in order to find the perfect mate.
p115
aa(lp116
VVery interesting. This is a typeface designer
p117
aVfrom Israel who has designed \u2014 he calls them "typosperma."
p118
aVHe's thinking \u2014 of course it's all a concept \u2014
p119
aVof injecting typefaces into spermatozoa,
p120
aVI don't know how to say it in English \u2014 spermatazoi \u2014
p121
aVin order to make them become \u2014 to almost have a song
p122
aVor a whole poem written with every ejaculation. (Laughter)
p123
aVI tell you, designers are quite fantastic, you know.
p124
aa(lp125
VSo, tissue design.
p126
aVIn this case too, you have a mixture of scientists and designers.
p127
aVThis here is part of the same lab at the Royal College of Arts.
p128
aVThe RCA is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint.
p129
aVOne of the assignments for a year was to work with in-vitro meat.
p130
aVYou know that already you can grow meat in vitro.
p131
aVIn Australia they did it \u2014 this research company, called SymbioticA.
p132
aVBut the problem is that it's a really ugly patty.
p133
aVAnd so, the assignment to the students was,
p134
aVhow should the steak of tomorrow be?
p135
aVWhen you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape,
p136
aVwhat should it be like?
p137
aVSo this particular student, James King,
p138
aVwent around the beautiful English countryside,
p139
aVpicked the best, best cow that he could see,
p140
aVand then put her in the MRI machine.
p141
aVThen, he took the scans of the best organs and made the meat \u2014
p142
aVof course, this is done with a Japanese resins food maker,
p143
aVbut you know, in the future it could be made better \u2014
p144
aVwhich reproduces the best MRI scan of the best cow he could find.
p145
aa(lp146
VInstead, this element here is much more banal.
p147
aVSomething that you know can be done already
p148
aVis to grow bone tissue, so that you can make a wedding ring
p149
aVout of the bone tissue of your loved one \u2014 literally.
p150
aVSo, this is indeed made of human bone tissue.
p151
aa(lp152
VThis is SymbioticA, and they've been working \u2014
p153
aVthey were the first ones to do this in-vitro meat \u2014
p154
aVand now they've also done an in-vitro coat, a leather coat.
p155
aVIt's miniscule, but it's a real coat. It's shaped like one.
p156
aVSo, we'll be able to really not have any excuse
p157
aVto be wearing everything leather in the future.
p158
aa(lp159
VOne of the most important topics of the show \u2014 you know,
p160
aVas anything in our life today,
p161
aVwe can look at it from many, many different viewpoints,
p162
aVand at different levels.
p163
aVOne of the most interesting and most important concepts
p164
aVis the idea of scale. We change scale very often:
p165
aVwe change resolution of screens, and
p166
aVwe're not really fazed by it, we do it very comfortably.
p167
aVSo you go, even in the exhibition,
p168
aVfrom the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale
p169
aVto the manipulation of really great amounts of data \u2014
p170
aVthe mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world.
p171
aVIn this particular case a section will be devoted
p172
aVto information design.
p173
aVYou see here the work of Ben Fry. This is "Human vs. Chimps" \u2014
p174
aVthe few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps.
p175
aVIt was a beautiful visualization that he did for Seed magazine.
p176
aVAnd here's the whole code of Pac-Man, visualized
p177
aVwith all the go-to, go-back-to,
p178
aValso made into a beautiful choreography.
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd then also graphs by scientists,
p181
aVthis beautiful diagraph of protein homology.
p182
aVScientists are starting to also consider aesthetics.
p183
aVWe were discussing with Keith Shrubb* this morning
p184
aVthe fact that many scientists
p185
aVtend not to use anything beautiful in their presentations,
p186
aVotherwise they're afraid of being considered dumb blondes.
p187
aVSo they pick the worst background
p188
aVfrom any kind of PowerPoint presentation, the worst typeface.
p189
aVIt's only recently that this kind of marriage
p190
aVbetween design and science is producing some of the first "pretty" \u2014
p191
aVif we can say so \u2014 scientific presentations.
p192
aVAnother aspect of contemporary design
p193
aVthat I think is mind-opening, promising
p194
aVand will really be the future of design,
p195
aVis the idea of collective design.
p196
aVYou know, the whole XO laptop, from One Laptop per Child,
p197
aVis based on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking.
p198
aVSo, the more the merrier.
p199
aVThe more computers, the stronger the signal,
p200
aVand children work on the interface so that it's all based
p201
aVon doing things together, tasks together.
p202
aVSo the idea of collective design
p203
aVis something that will become even bigger in the future,
p204
aVand this is chosen as an example.
p205
aa(lp206
VRelated to the idea of collective design and to the new balance
p207
aVbetween the individual and the collectiveness, collectivity
p208
aVis the idea of existence maximum.
p209
aVThat's a term that I coined a few years ago
p210
aVwhile I was thinking of how pressed we are together,
p211
aVand at the same time how these small objects,
p212
aVlike the Walkman first and then the iPod,
p213
aVcreate bubbles of space around us that enable us
p214
aVto have a metaphysical space
p215
aVthat is much bigger than our physical space.
p216
aVYou can be in the subway and you can be completely isolated
p217
aVand have your own room in your iPod.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd this is the work of several designers
p220
aVthat really enhance the idea of solitude and expansion
p221
aVby means of various techniques.
p222
aVThis is a spa telephone. The idea is that it's become so difficult
p223
aVto have a private conversation anywhere
p224
aVthat you go to the spa, you have a massage, you have a facial,
p225
aVmaybe a rub, and then you have this beautiful pool
p226
aVwith this perfect temperature, and you can have
p227
aVthis isolation tank phone conversation
p228
aVwith whomever you've been wanting to talk with for a long time.
p229
aVAnd same thing here, Social Tele-presence.
p230
aVIt's actually already used by the military a little bit,
p231
aVbut it's the idea of being able to be somewhere else
p232
aVwith your senses while you're removed from it physically.
p233
aVAnd this is called Blind Date. It's a [unclear],
p234
aVso if you're too shy to be really at the date,
p235
aVyou can stay at a distance with your flowers
p236
aVand somebody else reenacts the date for you.
p237
aa(lp238
VRapid manufacturing is another big area
p239
aVin which technology and design are, I think,
p240
aVbound to change the world. You've heard about it before many times.
p241
aVRapid manufacturing is a computer file
p242
aVsent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine.
p243
aVIt used to be called rapid prototyping, rapid modeling.
p244
aVIt started out in the '80s, but at the beginning
p245
aVit was machines carving out of a foam block
p246
aVa model that was very, very fragile,
p247
aVand could not have any real use.
p248
aVSlowly but surely, the materials became better \u2014 better resins.
p249
aVTechniques became better \u2014 not only carving
p250
aVbut also stereolithography and laser \u2014 solidifying all kinds of resins,
p251
aVwhether in powder or in liquid form. And the vats became bigger,
p252
aVto the point that now we can have actual chairs
p253
aVmade by rapid manufacturing.
p254
aVIt takes seven days today to manufacture a chair,
p255
aVbut you know what? One day it will take seven hours.
p256
aVAnd then the dream is that you'll be able to, from home,
p257
aVcustomize your chair. You know, companies and designers
p258
aVwill be designing the matrix or the margins
p259
aVthat respect both solidity and brand, and design identity.
p260
aVAnd then you can send it to the Kinko's store at the corner
p261
aa(lp262
Vand go get your chair. Now, the implications of this are enormous,
p263
aVnot only regarding the participation of the final buyer
p264
aVin the design process, but also no tracking,
p265
aVno warehousing, no wasted materials.
p266
aVAlso, I can imagine many design manufacturers
p267
aVwill have to retool their own business plans
p268
aVand maybe invest in this Kinko's store. But it really is a big change.
p269
aVAnd here I'm showing a picture that was in Wired Magazine \u2014
p270
aVyou know, the Artifacts of the Future section that I love so much \u2014
p271
aVthat shows you can have your desktop 3D printer
p272
aVand print your own basketball.
p273
aVBut here instead are examples, you can already 3D-print textiles,
p274
aVwhich is very interesting.
p275
aVThis is just a really nice touch \u2014 it's called slow prototyping.
p276
aVIt's a designer that put 10,000 bees at work and they built this vase.
p277
aVThey had a particular shape that they had to stay in.
p278
aa(lp279
VMapping and tagging.
p280
aVAs the capacity of computers becomes really, really big,
p281
aVand the capacity of our mind not that much bigger,
p282
aVwe find that we need to tag as much as we can what we do
p283
aVin order to then retrace our path.
p284
aVAlso, we do it in order to share with other people.
p285
aVAgain, this communal sense of experience
p286
aVthat seems to be so important today.
p287
aVSo, various ways to map and tag
p288
aVare also the work of many designers nowadays.
p289
aVAlso, the senses \u2014 designers and scientists all work on trying to expand
p290
aVour senses capabilities so that we can achieve more.
p291
aVAnd also animal senses in a way.
p292
aa(lp293
VThis particular object that many people love so much
p294
aVis actually based on kind of a scientific experiment \u2014
p295
aVthe fact that bees have a very strong olfactory sense,
p296
aVand so \u2014 much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer \u2014
p297
aVbees can be trained by Pavlovian reflex
p298
aVto detect one type of cancer, and also pregnancy.
p299
aVAnd so this student at the RCA
p300
aVdesigned this beautiful blown-glass object
p301
aVwhere the bees move from one chamber to the other
p302
aVif they detect that particular smell
p303
aVthat signifies, in this case, pregnancy.
p304
aVAnother shape is made for cancer.
p305
aa(lp306
VDesign for Debate is a very interesting new endeavor
p307
aVthat designers have really shaped for themselves.
p308
aVSome designers don't design objects, products,
p309
aVthings that we're going to actually use,
p310
aVbut rather, they design scenarios that are object-based.
p311
aVThey're still very useful.
p312
aVThey help companies and other designers think better about the future.
p313
aVAnd usually they are accompanied by videos.
p314
aVThis is quite beautiful. It's Dunne and Raby, "All the Robots."
p315
aVThose are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of.
p316
aVWe always think that robots will take care of us,
p317
aVand instead they designed these robots that are very, very needy.
p318
aVYou need to take one in your arms and look at it in the eyes
p319
aVfor about five minutes before it does something.
p320
aVAnother one gets really, really nervous if you get in to the room,
p321
aVand starts shaking, so you have to calm it down.
p322
aVSo it's really a way to make us think more
p323
aVabout what robots mean to us.
p324
aVNoam Toran and "Accessories for Lonely Men":
p325
aVthe idea is that when you lose your loved one
p326
aVor you go through a bad breakup,
p327
aVwhat you miss the most are those annoying things
p328
aVthat you used to hate when you were with the other person.
p329
aVSo he designed all these series of accessories.
p330
aVThis one is something that takes away the sheets from you at night.
p331
aVThen there's another one that breathes on your neck.
p332
aVThere's another one that throws plates and breaks them.
p333
aVSo it's just this idea of what we really miss in life.
p334
aa(lp335
VElio Caccavale: he took the idea
p336
aVof those dolls that explain leukemia.
p337
aVHe's working on dolls that explain xenotransplantation,
p338
aVand also the spider gene into the goat, from a few years ago.
p339
aVHe's working for the exhibition on a whole series of dolls
p340
aVthat explain to children where babies come from today.
p341
aVBecause it's not anymore Mom, Dad, the flowers and the bees,
p342
aVand then there's the baby. No, it can be two moms, three dads,
p343
aVin-vitro \u2014 there's the whole idea
p344
aVof how babies can be made today that has changed.
p345
aVSo it's a series of dolls that he's working on right now.
p346
aa(lp347
VOne of the most beautiful things
p348
aVis that designers really work on life,
p349
aVeven though they take technology into account.
p350
aVAnd many designers have been working recently
p351
aVon the idea of death and mourning,
p352
aVand what we can do about it today with new technologies.
p353
aVOr how we should behave about it with new technologies.
p354
aVThese three objects over there are hard drives
p355
aVwith a Bluetooth connection. But they're in reality
p356
aVvery, very beautiful sculpted artifacts
p357
aVthat contain the whole desktop and computer memory
p358
aVof somebody who passed away.
p359
aVSo instead of having only the pictures,
p360
aVyou will be able to put this object next to the computer
p361
aVand all of a sudden have, you know,
p362
aVGertrude's whole life and all of her files
p363
aVand her address book come alive.
p364
aa(lp365
VAnd this is even better. This is Auger-Loizeau, "AfterLife."
p366
aVIt's the idea that some people don't believe in an afterlife.
p367
aVSo to give them something tangible that shows that
p368
aVthere is something after death, they take the gastric juices
p369
aVof people who passed away and concentrate them,
p370
aVand put them into a battery that can actually be used
p371
aVto power flashlights. They also go \u2014 you know, sex toys, whatever.
p372
aVIt's quite amazing how these things can make you smile,
p373
aVcan make you laugh, can make you cry sometimes.
p374
aVBut I'm hoping that this particular exhibition
p375
aVwill be able to trace a new portrait of where design is going \u2014
p376
aVwhich is always, hopefully, a portrait a few years in advance
p377
aVof where the world is going.
p378
aVThank you very much.
