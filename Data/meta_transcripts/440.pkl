VSo, I want to start out with
p4
aVthis beautiful picture from my childhood.
p5
aVI love the science fiction movies.
p6
aVHere it is: "This Island Earth."
p7
aVAnd leave it to Hollywood to get it just right.
p8
aVTwo-and-a-half years in the making.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aVI mean, even the creationists give us 6,000,
p11
aVbut Hollywood goes to the chase.
p12
aVAnd in this movie, we see what we think is out there:
p13
aVflying saucers and aliens.
p14
aVEvery world has an alien, and every alien world has a flying saucer,
p15
aVand they move about with great speed. Aliens.
p16
aa(lp17
VWell, Don Brownlee, my friend, and I finally got to the point
p18
aVwhere we got tired of turning on the TV
p19
aVand seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night,
p20
aVand tried to write a counter-argument to it,
p21
aVand put out what does it really take for an Earth to be habitable,
p22
aVfor a planet to be an Earth, to have a place
p23
aVwhere you could probably get not just life, but complexity,
p24
aVwhich requires a huge amount of evolution,
p25
aVand therefore constancy of conditions.
p26
aVSo, in 2000 we wrote "Rare Earth." In 2003, we then asked,
p27
aVlet's not think about where Earths are in space, but how long has Earth been Earth?
p28
aVIf you go back two billion years,
p29
aVyou're not on an Earth-like planet any more.
p30
aVWhat we call an Earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time.
p31
aa(lp32
VWell, "Rare Earth" actually
p33
aVtaught me an awful lot about meeting the public.
p34
aVRight after, I got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention,
p35
aVand with all great earnestness walked in.
p36
aVDavid Brin was going to debate me on this,
p37
aVand as I walked in, the crowd of a hundred started booing lustily.
p38
aVI had a girl who came up who said, "My dad says you're the devil."
p39
aVYou cannot take people's aliens away from them
p40
aVand expect to be anybody's friends.
p41
aVWell, the second part of that, soon after \u2014
p42
aVand I was talking to Paul Allen; I saw him in the audience,
p43
aVand I handed him a copy of "Rare Earth."
p44
aVAnd Jill Tarter was there, and she turned to me,
p45
aVand she looked at me just like that girl in "The Exorcist."
p46
aVIt was, "It burns! It burns!"
p47
aVBecause SETI doesn't want to hear this.
p48
aVSETI wants there to be stuff out there.
p49
aVI really applaud the SETI efforts, but we have not heard anything yet.
p50
aVAnd I really do think we have to start thinking
p51
aVabout what's a good planet and what isn't.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, I throw this slide up because it indicates to me that,
p54
aVeven if SETI does hear something, can we figure out what they said?
p55
aVBecause this was a slide that was passed
p56
aVbetween the two major intelligences on Earth \u2014 a Mac to a PC \u2014
p57
aVand it can't even get the letters right \u2014
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aV\u2014 so how are we going to talk to the aliens?
p60
aVAnd if they're 50 light years away, and we call them up,
p61
aVand you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
p62
aVand then 50 years later it comes back and they say, Please repeat?
p63
aVI mean, there we are.
p64
aa(lp65
VOur planet is a good planet because it can keep water.
p66
aVMars is a bad planet, but it's still good enough for us to go there
p67
aVand to live on its surface if we're protected.
p68
aVBut Venus is a very bad \u2014 the worst \u2014 planet.
p69
aVEven though it's Earth-like, and even though early in its history
p70
aVit may very well have harbored Earth-like life,
p71
aVit soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse \u2014
p72
aVthat's an 800 degrees [Fahrenheit] surface \u2014
p73
aVbecause of rampant carbon dioxide.
p74
aa(lp75
VWell, we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict
p76
aVwhat's going to happen to our particular planet.
p77
aVWe are right now in the beautiful Oreo
p78
aVof existence \u2014 of at least life on Planet Earth \u2014
p79
aVfollowing the first horrible microbial age.
p80
aVIn the Cambrian explosion, life emerged from the swamps,
p81
aVcomplexity arose,
p82
aVand from what we can tell, we're halfway through.
p83
aVWe have as much time for animals to exist on this planet
p84
aVas they have been here now,
p85
aVtill we hit the second microbial age.
p86
aVAnd that will happen, paradoxically \u2014
p87
aVeverything you hear about global warming \u2014
p88
aVwhen we hit CO2 down to 10 parts per million,
p89
aVwe are no longer going to have to have plants
p90
aVthat are allowed to have any photosynthesis, and there go animals.
p91
aVSo, after that we probably have seven billion years.
p92
aVThe Sun increases in its intensity, in its brightness,
p93
aVand finally, at about 12 billion years after it first started,
p94
aVthe Earth is consumed by a large Sun,
p95
aVand this is what's left.
p96
aVSo, a planet like us is going to have an age and an old age,
p97
aVand we are in its golden summer age right now.
p98
aa(lp99
VBut there's two fates to everything, isn't there?
p100
aVNow, a lot of you are going to die of old age,
p101
aVbut some of you, horribly enough, are going to die in an accident.
p102
aVAnd that's the fate of a planet, too.
p103
aVEarth, if we're lucky enough \u2014 if it doesn't get hit by a Hale-Bopp,
p104
aVor gets blasted by some supernova nearby
p105
aVin the next seven billion years \u2014 we'll find under your feet.
p106
aVBut what about accidental death?
p107
aVWell, paleontologists for the last 200 years
p108
aVhave been charting death. It's strange \u2014
p109
aVextinction as a concept wasn't even thought about
p110
aVuntil Baron Cuvier in France found this first mastodon.
p111
aVHe couldn't match it up to any bones on the planet,
p112
aVand he said, Aha! It's extinct.
p113
aVAnd very soon after, the fossil record started yielding
p114
aVa very good idea of how many plants and animals there have been
p115
aVsince complex life really began to leave
p116
aVa very interesting fossil record.
p117
aVIn that complex record of fossils,
p118
aVthere were times when lots of stuff
p119
aVseemed to be dying out very quickly,
p120
aVand the father/mother geologists
p121
aVcalled these "mass extinctions."
p122
aa(lp123
VAll along it was thought to be either an act of God
p124
aVor perhaps long, slow climate change,
p125
aVand that really changed in 1980,
p126
aVin this rocky outcrop near Gubbio,
p127
aVwhere Walter Alvarez, trying to figure out
p128
aVwhat was the time difference between these white rocks,
p129
aVwhich held creatures of the Cretaceous period,
p130
aVand the pink rocks above, which held Tertiary fossils.
p131
aVHow long did it take to go from one system to the next?
p132
aVAnd what they found was something unexpected.
p133
aVThey found in this gap, in between, a very thin clay layer,
p134
aVand that clay layer \u2014 this very thin red layer here \u2014
p135
aVis filled with iridium.
p136
aVAnd not just iridium; it's filled with glassy spherules,
p137
aVand it's filled with quartz grains
p138
aVthat have been subjected to enormous pressure: shock quartz.
p139
aa(lp140
VNow, in this slide the white is chalk,
p141
aVand this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean.
p142
aVThe chalk itself's composed by plankton
p143
aVwhich has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor,
p144
aVso that 90 percent of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff,
p145
aVand then you have that millimeter-thick red layer,
p146
aVand then you have black rock.
p147
aVAnd the black rock is the sediment on the sea bottom
p148
aVin the absence of plankton.
p149
aVAnd that's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe,
p150
aVbecause that's what this was, of course. This is the famous K-T.
p151
aVA 10-kilometer body hit the planet.
p152
aVThe effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet,
p153
aVand we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs,
p154
aVthe death of these beautiful ammonites,
p155
aVLeconteiceras here, and Celaeceras over here,
p156
aVand so much else.
p157
aa(lp158
VI mean, it must be true,
p159
aVbecause we've had two Hollywood blockbusters since that time,
p160
aVand this paradigm, from 1980 to about 2000,
p161
aVtotally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes.
p162
aVPrior to that, uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm:
p163
aVthe fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past,
p164
aVthere are present-day processes that will explain it.
p165
aVBut we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact,
p166
aVso this is a type of neo-catastrophism,
p167
aVand it took about 20 years for the scientific establishment
p168
aVto finally come to grips: yes, we were hit;
p169
aVand yes, the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction.
p170
aa(lp171
VWell, there are five major mass extinctions
p172
aVover the last 500 million years, called the Big Five.
p173
aVThey range from 450 million years ago
p174
aVto the last, the K-T, number four,
p175
aVbut the biggest of all was the P, or the Permian extinction,
p176
aVsometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions.
p177
aVAnd every one of these has been subsequently blamed
p178
aVon large-body impact.
p179
aVBut is this true?
p180
aa(lp181
VThe most recent, the Permian, was thought to have been an impact
p182
aVbecause of this beautiful structure on the right.
p183
aVThis is a Buckminsterfullerene, a carbon-60.
p184
aVBecause it looks like those terrible geodesic domes
p185
aVof my late beloved '60s,
p186
aVthey're called "buckyballs."
p187
aVThis evidence was used to suggest
p188
aVthat at the end of the Permian, 250 million years ago, a comet hit us.
p189
aVAnd when the comet hits, the pressure produces the buckyballs,
p190
aVand it captures bits of the comet.
p191
aVHelium-3: very rare on the surface of the Earth, very common in space.
p192
aa(lp193
VBut is this true?
p194
aVIn 1990, working on the K-T extinction for 10 years,
p195
aVI moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year
p196
aVin the great Karoo desert.
p197
aVI was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa
p198
aVinto the new South Africa as I went year by year.
p199
aVAnd I worked on this Permian extinction,
p200
aVcamping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time.
p201
aVAnd the fossils are extraordinary.
p202
aVYou know, you're gazing upon your very distant ancestors.
p203
aVThese are mammal-like reptiles.
p204
aVThey are culturally invisible. We do not make movies about these.
p205
aVThis is a Gorgonopsian, or a Gorgon.
p206
aVThat's an 18-inch long skull of an animal
p207
aVthat was probably seven or eight feet, sprawled like a lizard,
p208
aVprobably had a head like a lion.
p209
aVThis is the top carnivore, the T-Rex of its time.
p210
aVBut there's lots of stuff.
p211
aVThis is my poor son, Patrick.
p212
aV(Laughter)
p213
aVThis is called paleontological child abuse.
p214
aVHold still, you're the scale.
p215
aV(Laughter)
p216
aa(lp217
VThere was big stuff back then.
p218
aVFifty-five species of mammal-like reptiles.
p219
aVThe age of mammals had well and truly started
p220
aV250 million years ago ...
p221
aV... and then a catastrophe happened.
p222
aVAnd what happens next is the age of dinosaurs.
p223
aVIt was all a mistake; it should have never happened. But it did.
p224
aVNow, luckily,
p225
aVthis Thrinaxodon, the size of a robin egg here:
p226
aVthis is a skull I've discovered just before taking this picture \u2014
p227
aVthere's a pen for scale; it's really tiny \u2014
p228
aVthis is in the Lower Triassic, after the mass extinction has finished.
p229
aVYou can see the eye socket and you can see the little teeth in the front.
p230
aVIf that does not survive, I'm not the thing giving this talk.
p231
aVSomething else is, because if that doesn't survive, we are not here;
p232
aVthere are no mammals. It's that close; one species ekes through.
p233
aa(lp234
VWell, can we say anything about the pattern of who survives and who doesn't?
p235
aVHere's sort of the end of that 10 years of work.
p236
aVThe ranges of stuff \u2014 the red line is the mass extinction.
p237
aVBut we've got survivors and things that get through,
p238
aVand it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold bloods.
p239
aVWarm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time.
p240
aVThe survivors that do get through
p241
aVproduce this world of crocodile-like creatures.
p242
aVThere's no dinosaurs yet; just this slow, saurian, scaly, nasty,
p243
aVswampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes.
p244
aVAnd there they would hide for 160 million years,
p245
aVuntil liberated by that K-T asteroid.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo, if not impact, what?
p248
aVAnd the what, I think, is that we returned, over and over again,
p249
aVto the Pre-Cambrian world, that first microbial age,
p250
aVand the microbes are still out there.
p251
aVThey hate we animals.
p252
aVThey really want their world back.
p253
aVAnd they've tried over and over and over again.
p254
aVThis suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions
p255
aVbecause it did is inherently anti-Gaian.
p256
aVThis whole Gaia idea, that life makes the world better for itself \u2014
p257
aVanybody been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles
p258
aVbelieving in the Gaia theory? No.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo, I really suspect there's an alternative,
p261
aVand that life does actually try to do itself in \u2014
p262
aVnot consciously, but just because it does.
p263
aVAnd here's the weapon, it seems, that it did so over the last 500 million years.
p264
aVThere are microbes which, through their metabolism,
p265
aVproduce hydrogen sulfide,
p266
aVand they do so in large amounts.
p267
aVHydrogen sulfide is very fatal to we humans.
p268
aVAs small as 200 parts per million will kill you.
p269
aVYou only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places \u2014 some lakes \u2014
p270
aVand get down, and you'll find that the water itself turns purple.
p271
aVIt turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes
p272
aVwhich have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide,
p273
aVand we can detect their presence today \u2014 we can see them \u2014
p274
aVbut we can also detect their presence in the past.
p275
aa(lp276
VAnd the last three years have seen
p277
aVan enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field.
p278
aVI am almost extinct \u2014
p279
aVI'm a paleontologist who collects fossils.
p280
aVBut the new wave of paleontologists \u2014 my graduate students \u2014
p281
aVcollect biomarkers.
p282
aVThey take the sediment itself, they extract the oil from it,
p283
aVand from that they can produce compounds
p284
aVwhich turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups.
p285
aVIt's because lipids are so tough, they can get preserved in sediment
p286
aVand last the hundreds of millions of years necessary,
p287
aVand be extracted and tell us who was there.
p288
aa(lp289
VAnd we know who was there. At the end of the Permian,
p290
aVat many of these mass extinction boundaries,
p291
aVthis is what we find: isorenieratene. It's very specific.
p292
aVIt can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen,
p293
aVand is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide \u2014
p294
aVenough, for instance, to come out of solution.
p295
aVThis led Lee Kump, and others from Penn State and my group,
p296
aVto propose what I call the Kump Hypothesis:
p297
aVmany of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen,
p298
aVby high CO2. And the worst effect of global warming, it turns out:
p299
aVhydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans.
p300
aa(lp301
VWell, what's the source of this?
p302
aVIn this particular case, the source over and over has been flood basalts.
p303
aVThis is a view of the Earth now, if we extract a lot of it.
p304
aVAnd each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb;
p305
aVactually, the effects are even worse.
p306
aVThis is when deep-Earth material comes to the surface,
p307
aVspreads out over the surface of the planet.
p308
aVWell, it's not the lava that kills anything,
p309
aVit's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it.
p310
aVThis isn't Volvos; this is volcanoes.
p311
aVBut carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo, these are new data Rob Berner and I \u2014 from Yale \u2014 put together,
p314
aVand what we try to do now is
p315
aVtrack the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record \u2014
p316
aVand we can do this from a variety of means \u2014
p317
aVand put all the red lines here,
p318
aVwhen these \u2014 what I call greenhouse mass extinctions \u2014 took place.
p319
aVAnd there's two things that are really evident here to me,
p320
aVis that these extinctions take place when CO2 is going up.
p321
aVBut the second thing that's not shown on here:
p322
aVthe Earth has never had any ice on it
p323
aVwhen we've had 1,000 parts per million CO2.
p324
aVWe are at 380 and climbing.
p325
aVWe should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most,
p326
aVbut my friend David Battisti in Seattle says he thinks a 100 years.
p327
aVSo, there goes the ice caps,
p328
aVand there comes 240 feet of sea level rise.
p329
aVI live in a view house now;
p330
aVI'm going to have waterfront.
p331
aa(lp332
VAll right, what's the consequence? The oceans probably turn purple.
p333
aVAnd we think this is the reason that complexity took so long
p334
aVto take place on planet Earth.
p335
aVWe had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period.
p336
aVThey stop complex life from existing.
p337
aVWe know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet.
p338
aVAnd I throw this slide in \u2014 this is me, actually, two months ago \u2014
p339
aVand I throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal, chambered nautilus.
p340
aVIt's been on this planet since the animals first started \u2014 500 million years.
p341
aVThis is a tracking experiment, and any of you scuba divers,
p342
aVif you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever,
p343
aVthis is off the Great Barrier Reef.
p344
aVAnd as we speak now,
p345
aVthese nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us.
p346
aa(lp347
VBut the thing about this is that every once in a while
p348
aVwe divers can run into trouble,
p349
aVso I'm going to do a little thought experiment here.
p350
aVThis is a Great White Shark that ate some of my traps.
p351
aVWe pulled it up; up it comes. So, it's out there with me at night.
p352
aVSo, I'm swimming along, and it takes off my leg.
p353
aVI'm 80 miles from shore, what's going to happen to me?
p354
aVWell now, I die.
p355
aVFive years from now, this is what I hope happens to me:
p356
aVI'm taken back to the boat, I'm given a gas mask:
p357
aV80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide.
p358
aVI'm then thrown in an ice pond, I'm cooled 15 degrees lower
p359
aVand I could be taken to a critical care hospital.
p360
aVAnd the reason I could do that is because we mammals
p361
aVhave gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events,
p362
aVand our bodies have adapted.
p363
aVAnd we can now use this as what I think will be a major medical breakthrough.
p364
aa(lp365
VThis is Mark Roth. He was funded by DARPA.
p366
aVTried to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries.
p367
aVHe bleeds out pigs.
p368
aVHe puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide \u2014
p369
aVthe same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions \u2014
p370
aVand he turns a mammal into a reptile.
p371
aV"I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles
p372
aVhaving undergone a series of exposures to H2S."
p373
aVI got this email from him two years ago;
p374
aVhe said, "I think I've got an answer to some of your questions."
p375
aVSo, he now has taken mice down
p376
aVfor as many as four hours, sometimes six hours,
p377
aVand these are brand-new data he sent me on the way over here.
p378
aVOn the top, now, that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through \u2014
p379
aVthe dotted line, the temperatures.
p380
aVSo, the temperature starts at 25 centigrade,
p381
aVand down it goes, down it goes.
p382
aVSix hours later, up goes the temperature.
p383
aVNow, the same mouse is given 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide
p384
aVin this solid graph,
p385
aVand look what happens to its temperature.
p386
aVIts temperature drops.
p387
aVIt goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35,
p388
aVand comes out of this perfectly fine.
p389
aa(lp390
VHere is a way we can get people to critical care.
p391
aVHere's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care.
p392
aVNow, you're all thinking, yeah, what about the brain tissue?
p393
aVAnd so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen.
p394
aVYou're in an accident. You've got two choices:
p395
aVyou're going to die, or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide
p396
aVand, say, 75 percent of you is saved, mentally.
p397
aVWhat are you going to do?

aVDo we all have to have a little button saying, Let me die?
p399
aVThis is coming towards us,
p400
aVand I think this is going to be a revolution.
p401
aVWe're going to save lives, but there's going to be a cost to it.

aa(lp403
VThe new view of mass extinctions is, yes, we were hit,
p404
aVand, yes, we have to think about the long term,
p405
aVbecause we will get hit again.
p406
aVBut there's a far worse danger confronting us.
p407
aVWe can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world.
p408
aVGive us a few millennia \u2014
p409
aVand we humans should last those few millennia \u2014
p410
aVwill it happen again? If we continue, it'll happen again.

aVHow many of us flew here?
p412
aVHow many of us have gone through
p413
aVour entire Kyoto quota
p414
aVjust for flying this year?
p415
aVHow many of you have exceeded it? Yeah, I've certainly exceeded it.
p416
aVWe have a huge problem facing us as a species.
p417
aVWe have to beat this.
p418
aVI want to be able to go back to this reef. Thank you.

p423
aVAm I understanding you right, that what you're saying here
p424
aVis that we have in our own bodies
p425
aVa biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide
p426
aVthat in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions
p427
aVdue to climate change?

VPeter Ward: Yeah, every single cell in us
p430
aVcan produce minute quantities of hydrogen sulfide in great crises.
p431
aVThis is what Roth has found out.
p432
aVSo, what we're looking at now: does it leave a signal?
p433
aVDoes it leave a signal in bone or in plant?
p434
aVAnd we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect
p435
aVhow many of these have happened in the past.
