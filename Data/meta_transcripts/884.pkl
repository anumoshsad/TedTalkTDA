VSo since I was here last in '06,
p4
aVwe discovered that global climate change
p5
aVis turning out to be a pretty serious issue,
p6
aVso we covered that fairly extensively
p7
aVin Skeptic magazine.
p8
aVWe investigate all kinds
p9
aVof scientific and quasi-scientific controversies,
p10
aVbut it turns out we don't have to worry about any of this
p11
aVbecause the world's going to end in 2012.
p12
aa(lp13
VAnother update:
p14
aVYou will recall I introduced you guys
p15
aVto the Quadro Tracker.
p16
aVIt's like a water dowsing device.
p17
aVIt's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around.
p18
aVAnd you walk around, and it points to things.
p19
aVLike if you're looking for marijuana in students' lockers,
p20
aVit'll point right to somebody.
p21
aVOh, sorry. (Laughter)
p22
aVThis particular one that was given to me
p23
aVfinds golf balls,
p24
aVespecially if you're at a golf course
p25
aVand you check under enough bushes.
p26
aVWell, under the category of "What's the harm of silly stuff like this?"
p27
aVthis device, the ADE 651,
p28
aVwas sold to the Iraqi government
p29
aVfor 40,000 dollars apiece.
p30
aVIt's just like this one, completely worthless,
p31
aVin which it allegedly worked by "electrostatic
p32
aVmagnetic ion attraction,"
p33
aVwhich translates to
p34
aV"pseudoscientific baloney" \u2014 would be the nice word \u2014
p35
aVin which you string together a bunch of words that sound good,
p36
aVbut it does absolutely nothing.
p37
aVIn this case, at trespass points,
p38
aVallowing people to go through
p39
aVbecause your little tracker device said they were okay,
p40
aVactually cost lives.
p41
aVSo there is a danger to pseudoscience,
p42
aVin believing in this sort of thing.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo what I want to talk about today is belief.
p45
aVI want to believe,
p46
aVand you do too.
p47
aVAnd in fact, I think my thesis here is that
p48
aVbelief is the natural state of things.
p49
aVIt is the default option. We just believe.
p50
aVWe believe all sorts of things.
p51
aVBelief is natural;
p52
aVdisbelief, skepticism, science, is not natural.
p53
aVIt's more difficult.
p54
aVIt's uncomfortable to not believe things.
p55
aVSo like Fox Mulder on "X-Files,"
p56
aVwho wants to believe in UFOs? Well, we all do,
p57
aVand the reason for that is because
p58
aVwe have a belief engine in our brains.
p59
aVEssentially, we are pattern-seeking primates.
p60
aVWe connect the dots: A is connected to B; B is connected to C.
p61
aVAnd sometimes A really is connected to B,
p62
aVand that's called association learning.
p63
aa(lp64
VWe find patterns, we make those connections,
p65
aVwhether it's Pavlov's dog here
p66
aVassociating the sound of the bell with the food,
p67
aVand then he salivates to the sound of the bell,
p68
aVor whether it's a Skinnerian rat,
p69
aVin which he's having an association
p70
aVbetween his behavior and a reward for it,
p71
aVand therefore he repeats the behavior.
p72
aVIn fact, what Skinner discovered
p73
aVis that, if you put a pigeon in a box like this,
p74
aVand he has to press one of these two keys,
p75
aVand he tries to figure out what the pattern is,
p76
aVand you give him a little reward in the hopper box there \u2014
p77
aVif you just randomly assign rewards
p78
aVsuch that there is no pattern,
p79
aVthey will figure out any kind of pattern.
p80
aVAnd whatever they were doing just before they got the reward,
p81
aVthey repeat that particular pattern.
p82
aVSometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise,
p83
aVonce clockwise and peck the key twice.
p84
aVAnd that's called superstition,
p85
aVand that, I'm afraid,
p86
aVwe will always have with us.
p87
aa(lp88
VI call this process "patternicity" \u2014
p89
aVthat is, the tendency to find meaningful patterns
p90
aVin both meaningful and meaningless noise.
p91
aVWhen we do this process, we make two types of errors.
p92
aVA Type I error, or false positive,
p93
aVis believing a pattern is real
p94
aVwhen it's not.
p95
aVOur second type of error is a false negative.
p96
aVA Type II error is not believing
p97
aVa pattern is real when it is.
p98
aVSo let's do a thought experiment.
p99
aVYou are a hominid three million years ago
p100
aVwalking on the plains of Africa.
p101
aVYour name is Lucy, okay?
p102
aVAnd you hear a rustle in the grass.
p103
aVIs it a dangerous predator,
p104
aVor is it just the wind?
p105
aVYour next decision could be the most important one of your life.
p106
aVWell, if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator
p107
aVand it turns out it's just the wind,
p108
aVyou've made an error in cognition,
p109
aVmade a Type I error, false positive.
p110
aVBut no harm. You just move away.
p111
aVYou're more cautious. You're more vigilant.
p112
aVOn the other hand, if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind,
p113
aVand it turns out it's a dangerous predator,
p114
aVyou're lunch.
p115
aVYou've just won a Darwin award.
p116
aVYou've been taken out of the gene pool.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow the problem here is that
p119
aVpatternicities will occur whenever the cost
p120
aVof making a Type I error
p121
aVis less than the cost of making a Type II error.
p122
aVThis is the only equation in the talk by the way.
p123
aVWe have a pattern detection problem
p124
aVthat is assessing the difference between a Type I and a Type II error
p125
aVis highly problematic,
p126
aVespecially in split-second, life-and-death situations.
p127
aVSo the default position
p128
aVis just: Believe all patterns are real \u2014
p129
aVAll rustles in the grass are dangerous predators
p130
aVand not just the wind.
p131
aVAnd so I think that we evolved ...
p132
aVthere was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines,
p133
aVour pattern-seeking brain processes,
p134
aVto always find meaningful patterns
p135
aVand infuse them with these sort of
p136
aVpredatory or intentional agencies that I'll come back to.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo for example, what do you see here?
p139
aVIt's a horse head, that's right.
p140
aVIt looks like a horse. It must be a horse.
p141
aVThat's a pattern.
p142
aVAnd is it really a horse?
p143
aVOr is it more like a frog?
p144
aVSee, our pattern detection device,
p145
aVwhich appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex \u2014
p146
aVit's our little detection device there \u2014
p147
aVcan be easily fooled, and this is the problem.
p148
aVFor example, what do you see here?
p149
aVYes, of course, it's a cow.
p150
aVOnce I prime the brain \u2014 it's called cognitive priming \u2014
p151
aVonce I prime the brain to see it,
p152
aVit pops back out again even without the pattern that I've imposed on it.
p153
aVAnd what do you see here?
p154
aVSome people see a Dalmatian dog.
p155
aVYes, there it is. And there's the prime.
p156
aVSo when I go back without the prime,
p157
aVyour brain already has the model
p158
aVso you can see it again.
p159
aVWhat do you see here?
p160
aVPlanet Saturn. Yes, that's good.
p161
aVHow about here?
p162
aVJust shout out anything you see.
p163
aVThat's a good audience, Chris.
p164
aVBecause there's nothing in this. Well, allegedly there's nothing.
p165
aa(lp166
VThis is an experiment done by Jennifer Whitson
p167
aVat U.T. Austin
p168
aVon corporate environments
p169
aVand whether feelings of uncertainty and out of control
p170
aVmakes people see illusory patterns.
p171
aVThat is, almost everybody sees the planet Saturn.
p172
aVPeople that are put in a condition of feeling out of control
p173
aVare more likely to see something in this,
p174
aVwhich is allegedly patternless.
p175
aVIn other words, the propensity to find these patterns
p176
aVgoes up when there's a lack of control.
p177
aVFor example, baseball players are notoriously superstitious
p178
aVwhen they're batting,
p179
aVbut not so much when they're fielding.
p180
aVBecause fielders are successful
p181
aV90 to 95 percent of the time.
p182
aVThe best batters fail seven out of 10 times.
p183
aVSo their superstitions, their patternicities,
p184
aVare all associated with feelings of lack of control
p185
aVand so forth.
p186
aa(lp187
VWhat do you see in this particular one here, in this field?
p188
aVAnybody see an object there?
p189
aVThere actually is something here,
p190
aVbut it's degraded.
p191
aVWhile you're thinking about that,
p192
aVthis was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore,
p193
aVa psychologist in England,
p194
aVwho showed subjects this degraded image
p195
aVand then ran a correlation between
p196
aVtheir scores on an ESP test:
p197
aVHow much did they believe in the paranormal,
p198
aVsupernatural, angels and so forth.
p199
aVAnd those who scored high on the ESP scale,
p200
aVtended to not only see
p201
aVmore patterns in the degraded images
p202
aVbut incorrect patterns.
p203
aVHere is what you show subjects.
p204
aVThe fish is degraded 20 percent, 50 percent
p205
aVand then the one I showed you,
p206
aV70 percent.
p207
aa(lp208
VA similar experiment was done by another [Swiss] psychologist
p209
aVnamed Peter Brugger,
p210
aVwho found significantly more meaningful patterns
p211
aVwere perceived on the right hemisphere,
p212
aVvia the left visual field, than the left hemisphere.
p213
aVSo if you present subjects the images such
p214
aVthat it's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left,
p215
aVthen they're more likely to see patterns
p216
aVthan if you put it on the left hemisphere.
p217
aVOur right hemisphere appears to be
p218
aVwhere a lot of this patternicity occurs.
p219
aVSo what we're trying to do is bore into the brain
p220
aVto see where all this happens.
p221
aa(lp222
VBrugger and his colleague, Christine Mohr,
p223
aVgave subjects L-DOPA.
p224
aVL-DOPA's a drug, as you know, given for treating Parkinson's disease,
p225
aVwhich is related to a decrease in dopamine.
p226
aVL-DOPA increases dopamine.
p227
aVAn increase of dopamine caused
p228
aVsubjects to see more patterns
p229
aVthan those that did not receive the dopamine.
p230
aVSo dopamine appears to be the drug
p231
aVassociated with patternicity.
p232
aVIn fact, neuroleptic drugs
p233
aVthat are used to eliminate psychotic behavior,
p234
aVthings like paranoia, delusions
p235
aVand hallucinations,
p236
aVthese are patternicities.
p237
aVThey're incorrect patterns. They're false positives. They're Type I errors.
p238
aVAnd if you give them drugs
p239
aVthat are dopamine antagonists,
p240
aVthey go away.
p241
aVThat is, you decrease the amount of dopamine,
p242
aVand their tendency to see
p243
aVpatterns like that decreases.
p244
aVOn the other hand, amphetamines like cocaine
p245
aVare dopamine agonists.
p246
aVThey increase the amount of dopamine.
p247
aVSo you're more likely to feel in a euphoric state,
p248
aVcreativity, find more patterns.
p249
aa(lp250
VIn fact, I saw Robin Williams recently
p251
aVtalk about how he thought he was much funnier
p252
aVwhen he was doing cocaine, when he had that issue, than now.
p253
aVSo perhaps more dopamine
p254
aVis related to more creativity.
p255
aVDopamine, I think, changes
p256
aVour signal-to-noise ratio.
p257
aVThat is, how accurate we are
p258
aVin finding patterns.
p259
aVIf it's too low, you're more likely to make too many Type II errors.
p260
aVYou miss the real patterns. You don't want to be too skeptical.
p261
aVIf you're too skeptical, you'll miss the really interesting good ideas.
p262
aVJust right, you're creative, and yet you don't fall for too much baloney.
p263
aVToo high and maybe you see patterns everywhere.
p264
aVEvery time somebody looks at you, you think people are staring at you.
p265
aVYou think people are talking about you.
p266
aVAnd if you go too far on that, that's just simply
p267
aVlabeled as madness.
p268
aVIt's a distinction perhaps we might make
p269
aVbetween two Nobel laureates, Richard Feynman
p270
aVand John Nash.
p271
aVOne sees maybe just the right number
p272
aVof patterns to win a Nobel Prize.
p273
aVThe other one also, but maybe too many patterns.
p274
aVAnd we then call that schizophrenia.
p275
aa(lp276
VSo the signal-to-noise ratio then presents us with a pattern-detection problem.
p277
aVAnd of course you all know exactly
p278
aVwhat this is, right?
p279
aVAnd what pattern do you see here?
p280
aVAgain, I'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here,
p281
aVcausing you conflicting pattern detections.
p282
aVYou know, of course, this is Via Uno shoes.
p283
aVThese are sandals.
p284
aVPretty sexy feet, I must say.
p285
aVMaybe a little Photoshopped.
p286
aVAnd of course, the ambiguous figures
p287
aVthat seem to flip-flop back and forth.
p288
aVIt turns out what you're thinking about a lot
p289
aVinfluences what you
p290
aVtend to see.
p291
aVAnd you see the lamp here, I know.
p292
aVBecause the lights on here.
p293
aVOf course, thanks to the environmentalist movement
p294
aVwe're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals.
p295
aVSo what you see in this particular ambiguous figure
p296
aVis, of course, the dolphins, right?
p297
aVYou see a dolphin here,
p298
aVand there's a dolphin,
p299
aVand there's a dolphin.
p300
aVThat's a dolphin tail there, guys.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
VIf we can give you conflicting data, again,
p305
aVyour ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive.
p306
aVIf you look down here, it's fine. If you look up here, then you get conflicting data.
p307
aVAnd then we have to flip the image
p308
aVfor you to see that it's a set up.
p309
aVThe impossible crate illusion.
p310
aVIt's easy to fool the brain in 2D.
p311
aVSo you say, "Aw, come on Shermer, anybody can do that
p312
aVin a Psych 101 text with an illusion like that."
p313
aVWell here's the late, great Jerry Andrus'
p314
aV"impossible crate" illusion in 3D,
p315
aVin which Jerry is standing inside
p316
aVthe impossible crate.
p317
aVAnd he was kind enough to post this
p318
aVand give us the reveal.
p319
aVOf course, camera angle is everything. The photographer is over there,
p320
aVand this board appears to overlap with this one, and this one with that one, and so on.
p321
aVBut even when I take it away,
p322
aVthe illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired
p323
aVto find those certain kinds of patterns.
p324
aa(lp325
VThis is a fairly new one
p326
aVthat throws us off because of the conflicting patterns
p327
aVof comparing this angle with that angle.
p328
aVIn fact, it's the exact same picture side by side.
p329
aVSo what you're doing is comparing that angle
p330
aVinstead of with this one, but with that one.
p331
aVAnd so your brain is fooled.
p332
aVYet again, your pattern detection devices are fooled.
p333
aa(lp334
VFaces are easy to see
p335
aVbecause we have an additional evolved
p336
aVfacial recognition software
p337
aVin our temporal lobes.
p338
aVHere's some faces on the side of a rock.
p339
aVI'm actually not even sure if this is \u2014 this might be Photoshopped.
p340
aVBut anyway, the point is still made.
p341
aVNow which one of these looks odd to you?
p342
aVIn a quick reaction, which one looks odd?
p343
aVThe one on the left. Okay. So I'll rotate it
p344
aVso it'll be the one on the right.
p345
aVAnd you are correct.
p346
aVA fairly famous illusion \u2014 it was first done with Margaret Thatcher.
p347
aVNow, they trade up the politicians every time.
p348
aVWell, why is this happening?
p349
aVWell, we know exactly where it happens,
p350
aVin the temporal lobe, right across, sort of above your ear there,
p351
aVin a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.
p352
aVAnd there's two types of cells that do this,
p353
aVthat record facial features either globally,
p354
aVor specifically these large, rapid-firing cells,
p355
aVfirst look at the general face.
p356
aVSo you recognize Obama immediately.
p357
aVAnd then you notice something quite
p358
aVa little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth.
p359
aVEspecially when they're upside down,
p360
aVyou're engaging that general facial recognition software there.
p361
aa(lp362
VNow I said back in our little thought experiment,
p363
aVyou're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa.
p364
aVIs it just the wind or a dangerous predator?
p365
aVWhat's the difference between those?
p366
aVWell, the wind is inanimate;
p367
aVthe dangerous predator is an intentional agent.
p368
aVAnd I call this process agenticity.
p369
aVThat is the tendency to infuse patterns
p370
aVwith meaning, intention and agency,
p371
aVoften invisible beings from the top down.
p372
aVThis is an idea that we got
p373
aVfrom a fellow TEDster here, Dan Dennett,
p374
aVwho talked about taking the intentional stance.
p375
aa(lp376
VSo it's a type of that expanded to explain, I think, a lot of different things:
p377
aVsouls, spirits, ghosts, gods, demons, angels,
p378
aValiens, intelligent designers,
p379
aVgovernment conspiracists
p380
aVand all manner of invisible agents
p381
aVwith power and intention, are believed
p382
aVto haunt our world and control our lives.
p383
aVI think it's the basis of animism
p384
aVand polytheism and monotheism.
p385
aVIt's the belief that aliens are somehow
p386
aVmore advanced than us, more moral than us,
p387
aVand the narratives always are
p388
aVthat they're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high.
p389
aVThe intelligent designer's always portrayed
p390
aVas this super intelligent, moral being
p391
aVthat comes down to design life.
p392
aVEven the idea that government can rescue us \u2014
p393
aVthat's no longer the wave of the future,
p394
aVbut that is, I think, a type of agenticity:
p395
aVprojecting somebody up there,
p396
aVbig and powerful, will come rescue us.
p397
aa(lp398
VAnd this is also, I think, the basis of conspiracy theories.
p399
aVThere's somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings,
p400
aVwhether it's the Illuminati
p401
aVor the Bilderbergers.
p402
aVBut this is a pattern detection problem, isn't it?
p403
aVSome patterns are real and some are not.
p404
aVWas JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin?
p405
aVWell, if you go there \u2014 there's people there on any given day \u2014
p406
aVlike when I went there, here \u2014 showing me where the different shooters were.
p407
aVMy favorite one was he was in the manhole.
p408
aVAnd he popped out at the last second, took that shot.
p409
aVBut of course, Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy.
p410
aVSo we can't just uniformly dismiss
p411
aVall patterns like that.
p412
aVBecause, let's face it, some patterns are real.
p413
aVSome conspiracies really are true.
p414
aVExplains a lot, maybe.
p415
aa(lp416
VAnd 9/11 has a conspiracy theory. It is a conspiracy.
p417
aVWe did a whole issue on it.
p418
aVNineteen members of Al Queda plotting to fly planes into buildings
p419
aVconstitutes a conspiracy.
p420
aVBut that's not what the "9/11 truthers" think.
p421
aVThey think it was an inside job by the Bush administration.
p422
aVWell, that's a whole other lecture.
p423
aVYou know how we know that 9/11
p424
aVwas not orchestrated by the Bush administration?
p425
aVBecause it worked.
p426
aa(lp427
V(Laughter)
p428
aa(lp429
V(Applause)
p430
aa(lp431
VSo we are natural-born dualists.
p432
aVOur agenticity process comes from
p433
aVthe fact that we can enjoy movies like these.
p434
aVBecause we can imagine, in essence,
p435
aVcontinuing on.
p436
aVWe know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe,
p437
aVyou can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences,
p438
aVnear-death experiences,
p439
aVwhich you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there.
p440
aVOr you can do it through loss of consciousness,
p441
aVby accelerating in a centrifuge.
p442
aVYou get a hypoxia, or a lower oxygen.
p443
aVAnd the brain then senses
p444
aVthat there's an out-of-body experience.
p445
aVYou can use \u2014 which I did, went out and did \u2014
p446
aVMichael Persinger's God Helmet,
p447
aVthat bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves.
p448
aVAnd you get a sense of out-of-body experience.
p449
aa(lp450
VSo I'm going to end here with a short video clip
