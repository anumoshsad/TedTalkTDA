VIn two weeks time, that's the ninth anniversary
p4
aVof the day I first stepped out onto that hallowed "Jeopardy" set.
p5
aVI mean, nine years is a long time.
p6
aVAnd given "Jeopardy's" average demographics,
p7
aVI think what that means
p8
aVis most of the people who saw me on that show are now dead.
p9
aV(Laughter)
p10
aVBut not all, a few are still alive.
p11
aVOccasionally I still get recognized at the mall or whatever.
p12
aVAnd when I do, it's as a bit of a know-it-all.
p13
aVI think that ship has sailed, it's too late for me.
p14
aVFor better or for worse, that's what I'm going to be known as,
p15
aVas the guy who knew a lot of weird stuff.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd I can't complain about this.
p18
aVI feel like that was always sort of my destiny,
p19
aValthough I had for many years been pretty deeply in the trivia closet.
p20
aVIf nothing else, you realize very quickly as a teenager,
p21
aVit is not a hit with girls to know Captain Kirk's middle name.
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVAnd as a result, I was sort of the deeply closeted kind of know-it-all for many years.
p24
aVBut if you go further back, if you look at it, it's all there.
p25
aVI was the kind of kid who was always bugging Mom and Dad
p26
aVwith whatever great fact I had just read about \u2014
p27
aVHaley's comet or giant squids
p28
aVor the size of the world's biggest pumpkin pie or whatever it was.
p29
aVI now have a 10-year-old of my own who's exactly the same.
p30
aVAnd I know how deeply annoying it is, so karma does work.
p31
aV(Laughter)
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd I loved game shows, fascinated with game shows.
p34
aVI remember crying on my first day of kindergarten back in 1979
p35
aVbecause it had just hit me, as badly as I wanted to go to school,
p36
aVthat I was also going to miss "Hollywood Squares" and "Family Feud."
p37
aVI was going to miss my game shows.
p38
aVAnd later, in the mid-'80s,
p39
aVwhen "Jeopardy" came back on the air,
p40
aVI remember running home from school every day to watch the show.
p41
aVIt was my favorite show, even before it paid for my house.
p42
aVAnd we lived overseas, we lived in South Korea where my dad was working,
p43
aVwhere there was only one English language TV channel.
p44
aVThere was Armed Forces TV,
p45
aVand if you didn't speak Korean, that's what you were watching.
p46
aVSo me and all my friends would run home every day and watch "Jeopardy."
p47
aa(lp48
VI was always that kind of obsessed trivia kid.
p49
aVI remember being able to play Trivial Pursuit against my parents back in the '80s
p50
aVand holding my own, back when that was a fad.
p51
aVThere's a weird sense of mastery you get
p52
aVwhen you know some bit of boomer trivia that Mom and Dad don't know.
p53
aVYou know some Beatles factoid that Dad didn't know.
p54
aVAnd you think, ah hah, knowledge really is power \u2014
p55
aVthe right fact deployed at exactly the right place.
p56
aa(lp57
VI never had a guidance counselor
p58
aVwho thought this was a legitimate career path,
p59
aVthat thought you could major in trivia
p60
aVor be a professional ex-game show contestant.
p61
aVAnd so I sold out way too young.
p62
aVI didn't try to figure out what one does with that.
p63
aVI studied computers because I heard that was the thing,
p64
aVand I became a computer programmer \u2014
p65
aVnot an especially good one,
p66
aVnot an especially happy one at the time when I was first on "Jeopardy" in 2004.
p67
aVBut that's what I was doing.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd it made it doubly ironic \u2014 my computer background \u2014
p70
aVa few years later, I think 2009 or so,
p71
aVwhen I got another phone call from "Jeopardy" saying,
p72
aV"It's early days yet, but IBM tells us
p73
aVthey want to build a supercomputer to beat you at 'Jeopardy.'
p74
aVAre you up for this?"
p75
aVThis was the first I'd heard of it.
p76
aVAnd of course I said yes, for several reasons.
p77
aVOne, because playing "Jeopardy" is a great time.
p78
aVIt's fun. It's the most fun you can have with your pants on.
p79
aV(Laughter)
p80
aVAnd I would do it for nothing.
p81
aVI don't think they know that, luckily,
p82
aVbut I would go back and play for Arby's coupons.
p83
aVI just love "Jeopardy," and I always have.
p84
aVAnd second of all, because I'm a nerdy guy and this seemed like the future.
p85
aVPeople playing computers on game shows
p86
aVwas the kind of thing I always imagined would happen in the future,
p87
aVand now I could be on the stage with it.
p88
aVI was not going to say no.
p89
aa(lp90
VThe third reason I said yes
p91
aVis because I was pretty confident that I was going to win.
p92
aVI had taken some artificial intelligence classes.
p93
aVI knew there were no computers that could do what you need to do to win on "Jeopardy."
p94
aVPeople don't realize how tough it is to write that kind of program
p95
aVthat can read a "Jeopardy" clue in a natural language like English
p96
aVand understand all the double meanings, the puns, the red herrings,
p97
aVunpack the meaning of the clue.
p98
aVThe kind of thing that a three- or four-year-old human, little kid could do,
p99
aVvery hard for a computer.
p100
aVAnd I thought, well this is going to be child's play.
p101
aVYes, I will come destroy the computer and defend my species.
p102
aV(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VBut as the years went on,
p105
aVas IBM started throwing money and manpower and processor speed at this,
p106
aVI started to get occasional updates from them,
p107
aVand I started to get a little more worried.
p108
aVI remember a journal article about this new question answering software that had a graph.
p109
aVIt was a scatter chart showing performance on "Jeopardy,"
p110
aVtens of thousands of dots representing "Jeopardy" champions up at the top
p111
aVwith their performance plotted on number of \u2014
p112
aVI was going to say questions answered, but answers questioned, I guess,
p113
aVclues responded to \u2014
p114
aVversus the accuracy of those answers.
p115
aVSo there's a certain performance level that the computer would need to get to.
p116
aVAnd at first, it was very low.
p117
aVThere was no software that could compete at this kind of arena.
p118
aVBut then you see the line start to go up.
p119
aVAnd it's getting very close to what they call the winner's cloud.
p120
aVAnd I noticed in the upper right of the scatter chart
p121
aVsome darker dots, some black dots, that were a different color.
p122
aVAnd thought, what are these?
p123
aV"The black dots in the upper right represent 74-time 'Jeopardy' champion Ken Jennings."
p124
aVAnd I saw this line coming for me.
p125
aVAnd I realized, this is it.
p126
aVThis is what it looks like when the future comes for you.
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aVIt's not the Terminator's gun sight;
p129
aVit's a little line coming closer and closer to the thing you can do,
p130
aVthe only thing that makes you special, the thing you're best at.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd when the game eventually happened about a year later,
p133
aVit was very different than the "Jeopardy" games I'd been used to.
p134
aVWe were not playing in L.A. on the regular "Jeopardy" set.
p135
aVWatson does not travel.
p136
aVWatson's actually huge.
p137
aVIt's thousands of processors, a terabyte of memory,
p138
aVtrillions of bytes of memory.
p139
aVWe got to walk through his climate-controlled server room.
p140
aVThe only other "Jeopardy" contestant to this day I've ever been inside.
p141
aVAnd so Watson does not travel.
p142
aVYou must come to it; you must make the pilgrimage.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo me and the other human player
p145
aVwound up at this secret IBM research lab
p146
aVin the middle of these snowy woods in Westchester County
p147
aVto play the computer.
p148
aVAnd we realized right away
p149
aVthat the computer had a big home court advantage.
p150
aVThere was a big Watson logo in the middle of the stage.
p151
aVLike you're going to play the Chicago Bulls,
p152
aVand there's the thing in the middle of their court.
p153
aVAnd the crowd was full of IBM V.P.s and programmers
p154
aVcheering on their little darling,
p155
aVhaving poured millions of dollars into this
p156
aVhoping against hope that the humans screw up,
p157
aVand holding up "Go Watson" signs
p158
aVand just applauding like pageant moms every time their little darling got one right.
p159
aVI think guys had "W-A-T-S-O-N" written on their bellies in grease paint.
p160
aVIf you can imagine computer programmers with the letters "W-A-T-S-O-N" written on their gut,
p161
aVit's an unpleasant sight.
p162
aa(lp163
VBut they were right. They were exactly right.
p164
aVI don't want to spoil it, if you still have this sitting on your DVR,
p165
aVbut Watson won handily.
p166
aVAnd I remember standing there behind the podium
p167
aVas I could hear that little insectoid thumb clicking.
p168
aVIt had a robot thumb that was clicking on the buzzer.
p169
aVAnd you could hear that little tick, tick, tick, tick.
p170
aVAnd I remember thinking, this is it.
p171
aVI felt obsolete.
p172
aVI felt like a Detroit factory worker of the '80s
p173
aVseeing a robot that could now do his job on the assembly line.
p174
aVI felt like quiz show contestant was now the first job that had become obsolete
p175
aVunder this new regime of thinking computers.
p176
aVAnd it hasn't been the last.
p177
aa(lp178
VIf you watch the news, you'll see occasionally \u2014
p179
aVand I see this all the time \u2014
p180
aVthat pharmacists now, there's a machine that can fill prescriptions automatically
p181
aVwithout actually needing a human pharmacist.
p182
aVAnd a lot of law firms are getting rid of paralegals
p183
aVbecause there's software that can sum up case laws and legal briefs and decisions.
p184
aVYou don't need human assistants for that anymore.
p185
aVI read the other day about a program where you feed it a box score
p186
aVfrom a baseball or football game
p187
aVand it spits out a news article as if a human had watched the game
p188
aVand was commenting on it.
p189
aVAnd obviously these new technologies can't do as clever or creative a job
p190
aVas the humans they're replacing,
p191
aVbut they're faster, and crucially, they're much, much cheaper.
p192
aVSo it makes me wonder what the economic effects of this might be.
p193
aVI've read economists saying that, as a result of these new technologies,
p194
aVwe'll enter a new golden age of leisure
p195
aVwhen we'll all have time for the things we really love
p196
aVbecause all these onerous tasks will be taken over by Watson and his digital brethren.
p197
aVI've heard other people say quite the opposite,
p198
aVthat this is yet another tier of the middle class
p199
aVthat's having the thing they can do taken away from them by a new technology
p200
aVand that this is actually something ominous,
p201
aVsomething that we should worry about.
p202
aa(lp203
VI'm not an economist myself.
p204
aVAll I know is how it felt to be the guy put out of work.
p205
aVAnd it was friggin' demoralizing. It was terrible.
p206
aVHere's the one thing that I was ever good at,
p207
aVand all it took was IBM pouring tens of millions of dollars and its smartest people
p208
aVand thousands of processors working in parallel
p209
aVand they could do the same thing.
p210
aVThey could do it a little bit faster and a little better on national TV,
p211
aVand "I'm sorry, Ken. We don't need you anymore."
p212
aVAnd it made me think, what does this mean,
p213
aVif we're going to be able to start outsourcing,
p214
aVnot just lower unimportant brain functions.
p215
aVI'm sure many of you remember a distant time
p216
aVwhen we had to know phone numbers, when we knew our friends' phone numbers.
p217
aVAnd suddenly there was a machine that did that,
p218
aVand now we don't need to remember that anymore.
p219
aVI have read that there's now actually evidence
p220
aVthat the hippocampus, the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships,
p221
aVphysically shrinks and atrophies
p222
aVin people who use tools like GPS,
p223
aVbecause we're not exercising our sense of direction anymore.
p224
aVWe're just obeying a little talking voice on our dashboard.
p225
aVAnd as a result, a part of our brain that's supposed to do that kind of stuff
p226
aVgets smaller and dumber.
p227
aVAnd it made me think, what happens when computers are now better
p228
aVat knowing and remembering stuff than we are?
p229
aVIs all of our brain going to start to shrink and atrophy like that?
p230
aVAre we as a culture going to start to value knowledge less?
p231
aVAs somebody who has always believed in the importance of the stuff that we know,
p232
aVthis was a terrifying idea to me.
p233
aa(lp234
VThe more I thought about it, I realized, no, it's still important.
p235
aVThe things we know are still important.
p236
aVI came to believe there were two advantages
p237
aVthat those of us who have these things in our head have
p238
aVover somebody who says, "Oh, yeah. I can Google that. Hold on a second."
p239
aVThere's an advantage of volume, and there's an advantage of time.
p240
aa(lp241
VThe advantage of volume, first,
p242
aVjust has to do with the complexity of the world nowadays.
p243
aVThere's so much information out there.
p244
aVBeing a Renaissance man or woman,
p245
aVthat's something that was only possible in the Renaissance.
p246
aVNow it's really not possible
p247
aVto be reasonably educated on every field of human endeavor.
p248
aVThere's just too much.
p249
aVThey say that the scope of human information
p250
aVis now doubling every 18 months or so,
p251
aVthe sum total of human information.
p252
aVThat means between now and late 2014,
p253
aVwe will generate as much information, in terms of gigabytes,
p254
aVas all of humanity has in all the previous millenia put together.
p255
aVIt's doubling every 18 months now.
p256
aVThis is terrifying because a lot of the big decisions we make
p257
aVrequire the mastery of lots of different kinds of facts.
p258
aVA decision like where do I go to school? What should I major in?
p259
aVWho do I vote for?
p260
aVDo I take this job or that one?
p261
aVThese are the decisions that require correct judgments
p262
aVabout many different kinds of facts.
p263
aVIf we have those facts at our mental fingertips,
p264
aVwe're going to be able to make informed decisions.
p265
aVIf, on the other hand, we need to look them all up,
p266
aVwe may be in trouble.
p267
aVAccording to a National Geographic survey I just saw,
p268
aVsomewhere along the lines of 80 percent
p269
aVof the people who vote in a U.S. presidential election about issues like foreign policy
p270
aVcannot find Iraq or Afghanistan on a map.
p271
aVIf you can't do that first step,
p272
aVare you really going to look up the other thousand facts you're going to need to know
p273
aVto master your knowledge of U.S. foreign policy?
p274
aVQuite probably not.
p275
aVAt some point you're just going to be like,
p276
aV"You know what? There's too much to know. Screw it."
p277
aVAnd you'll make a less informed decision.
p278
aa(lp279
VThe other issue is the advantage of time that you have
p280
aVif you have all these things at your fingertips.
p281
aVI always think of the story of a little girl named Tilly Smith.
p282
aVShe was a 10-year-old girl from Surrey, England
p283
aVon vacation with her parents a few years ago in Phuket, Thailand.
p284
aVShe runs up to them on the beach one morning
p285
aVand says, "Mom, Dad, we've got to get off the beach."
p286
aVAnd they say, "What do you mean? We just got here."
p287
aVAnd she said, "In Mr. Kearney's geography class last month,
p288
aVhe told us that when the tide goes out abruptly out to sea
p289
aVand you see the waves churning way out there,
p290
aVthat's the sign of a tsunami, and you need to clear the beach."
p291
aVWhat would you do if your 10-year-old daughter came up to you with this?
p292
aVHer parents thought about it,
p293
aVand they finally, to their credit, decided to believe her.
p294
aVThey told the lifeguard, they went back to the hotel,
p295
aVand the lifeguard cleared over 100 people off the beach, luckily,
p296
aVbecause that was the day of the Boxing Day tsunami,
p297
aVthe day after Christmas, 2004,
p298
aVthat killed thousands of people in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean.
p299
aVBut not on that beach, not on Mai Khao Beach,
p300
aVbecause this little girl had remembered one fact from her geography teacher a month before.
p301
aa(lp302
VNow when facts come in handy like that \u2014
p303
aVI love that story because it shows you the power of one fact,
p304
aVone remembered fact in exactly the right place at the right time \u2014
p305
aVnormally something that's easier to see on game shows than in real life.
p306
aVBut in this case it happened in real life.
p307
aVAnd it happens in real life all the time.
p308
aVIt's not always a tsunami, often it's a social situation.
p309
aVIt's a meeting or job interview or first date
p310
aVor some relationship that gets lubricated
p311
aVbecause two people realize they share some common piece of knowledge.
p312
aVYou say where you're from, and I say, "Oh, yeah."
p313
aVOr your alma mater or your job,
p314
aVand I know just a little something about it,
p315
aVenough to get the ball rolling.
p316
aVPeople love that shared connection that gets created
p317
aVwhen somebody knows something about you.
p318
aVIt's like they took the time to get to know you before you even met.
p319
aVThat's often the advantage of time.
p320
aVAnd it's not effective if you say, "Well, hold on.
p321
aVYou're from Fargo, North Dakota. Let me see what comes up.
p322
aVOh, yeah. Roger Maris was from Fargo."
p323
aVThat doesn't work. That's just annoying.
p324
aV(Laughter)
p325
aa(lp326
VThe great 18th-century British theologian and thinker, friend of Dr. Johnson,
p327
aVSamuel Parr once said, "It's always better to know a thing than not to know it."
p328
aVAnd if I have lived my life by any kind of creed, it's probably that.
p329
aVI have always believed that the things we know \u2014 that knowledge is an absolute good,
p330
aVthat the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads
p331
aVare what make us who we are,
p332
aVas individuals and as a species.
p333
aVI don't know if I want to live in a world where knowledge is obsolete.
p334
aVI don't want to live in a world where cultural literacy has been replaced
p335
aVby these little bubbles of specialty,
p336
aVso that none of us know about the common associations
p337
aVthat used to bind our civilization together.
p338
aVI don't want to be the last trivia know-it-all
p339
aVsitting on a mountain somewhere,
p340
aVreciting to himself the state capitals and the names of "Simpsons" episodes
p341
aVand the lyrics of Abba songs.
p342
aVI feel like our civilization works when this is a vast cultural heritage that we all share
p343
aVand that we know without having to outsource it to our devices,
p344
aVto our search engines and our smartphones.
p345
aa(lp346
VIn the movies, when computers like Watson start to think,
p347
aVthings don't always end well.
p348
aVThose movies are never about beautiful utopias.
p349
aVIt's always a terminator or a matrix or an astronaut getting sucked out an airlock in "2001."
p350
aVThings always go terribly wrong.
p351
aVAnd I feel like we're sort of at the point now
p352
aVwhere we need to make that choice of what kind of future we want to be living in.
p353
aVThis is a question of leadership,
p354
aVbecause it becomes a question of who leads the future.
p355
aVOn the one hand, we can choose between a new golden age
p356
aVwhere information is more universally available
p357
aVthan it's ever been in human history,
p358
aVwhere we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips.
p359
aVAnd on the other hand,
p360
aVwe have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia
p361
aVwhere the machines have taken over
p362
aVand we've all decided it's not important what we know anymore,
p363
aVthat knowledge isn't valuable because it's all out there in the cloud,
p364
aVand why would we ever bother learning anything new.
p365
aa(lp366
VThose are the two choices we have. I know which future I would rather be living in.
p367
aVAnd we can all make that choice.
p368
aVWe make that choice by being curious, inquisitive people who like to learn,
p369
aVwho don't just say, "Well, as soon as the bell has rung and the class is over,
p370
aVI don't have to learn anymore,"
p371
aVor "Thank goodness I have my diploma. I'm done learning for a lifetime.
p372
aVI don't have to learn new things anymore."
p373
aVNo, every day we should be striving to learn something new.
p374
aVWe should have this unquenchable curiosity for the world around us.
p375
aVThat's where the people you see on "Jeopardy" come from.
p376
aVThese know-it-alls, they're not Rainman-style savants
p377
aVsitting at home memorizing the phone book.
p378
aVI've met a lot of them.
p379
aVFor the most part, they are just normal folks
p380
aVwho are universally interested in the world around them, curious about everything,
p381
aVthirsty for this knowledge about whatever subject.
p382
aa(lp383
VWe can live in one of these two worlds.
p384
aVWe can live in a world where our brains, the things that we know,
p385
aVcontinue to be the thing that makes us special,
p386
aVor a world in which we've outsourced all of that to evil supercomputers from the future like Watson.
p387
aVLadies and gentlemen, the choice is yours.
p388
aa(lp389
