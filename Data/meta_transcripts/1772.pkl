VWriting biography is a strange thing to do.
p4
aVIt's a journey into the foreign territory
p5
aVof somebody else's life,
p6
aVa journey, an exploration that can take you places
p7
aVyou never dreamed of going
p8
aVand still can't quite believe you've been,
p9
aVespecially if, like me, you're an agnostic Jew
p10
aVand the life you've been exploring
p11
aVis that of Muhammad.
p12
aa(lp13
VFive years ago, for instance,
p14
aVI found myself waking each morning in misty Seattle
p15
aVto what I knew was an impossible question:
p16
aVWhat actually happened
p17
aVone desert night,
p18
aVhalf the world and almost half of history away?
p19
aVWhat happened, that is,
p20
aVon the night in the year 610
p21
aVwhen Muhammad received the first revelation of the Koran
p22
aVon a mountain just outside Mecca?
p23
aVThis is the core mystical moment of Islam,
p24
aVand as such, of course,
p25
aVit defies empirical analysis.
p26
aVYet the question wouldn't let go of me.
p27
aVI was fully aware that for someone as secular as I am,
p28
aVjust asking it could be seen
p29
aVas pure chutzpah.
p30
aV(Laughter)
p31
aVAnd I plead guilty as charged,
p32
aVbecause all exploration, physical or intellectual,
p33
aVis inevitably in some sense an act of transgression,
p34
aVof crossing boundaries.
p35
aa(lp36
VStill, some boundaries are larger than others.
p37
aVSo a human encountering the divine,
p38
aVas Muslims believe Muhammad did,
p39
aVto the rationalist, this is a matter not of fact
p40
aVbut of wishful fiction,
p41
aVand like all of us, I like to think of myself as rational.
p42
aa(lp43
VWhich might be why when I looked at the earliest accounts
p44
aVwe have of that night,
p45
aVwhat struck me even more than what happened
p46
aVwas what did not happen.
p47
aVMuhammad did not come floating off the mountain
p48
aVas though walking on air.
p49
aVHe did not run down shouting, "Hallelujah!"
p50
aVand "Bless the Lord!"
p51
aVHe did not radiate light and joy.
p52
aVThere were no choirs of angels,
p53
aVno music of the spheres, no elation, no ecstasy,
p54
aVno golden aura surrounding him,
p55
aVno sense of an absolute, fore-ordained role
p56
aVas the messenger of God.
p57
aVThat is, he did none of the things
p58
aVthat might make it easy to cry foul,
p59
aVto put down the whole story as a pious fable.
p60
aVQuite the contrary.
p61
aVIn his own reported words,
p62
aVhe was convinced at first
p63
aVthat what had happened couldn't have been real.
p64
aVAt best, he thought, it had to have been a hallucination \u2014
p65
aVa trick of the eye or the ear, perhaps,
p66
aVor his own mind working against him.
p67
aVAt worst, possession \u2014
p68
aVthat he'd been seized by an evil jinn,
p69
aVa spirit out to deceive him,
p70
aVeven to crush the life out of him.
p71
aVIn fact, he was so sure that he could only be majnun,
p72
aVpossessed by a jinn,
p73
aVthat when he found himself still alive,
p74
aVhis first impulse was to finish the job himself,
p75
aVto leap off the highest cliff
p76
aVand escape the terror of what he'd experienced
p77
aVby putting an end to all experience.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo the man who fled down the mountain that night
p80
aVtrembled not with joy
p81
aVbut with a stark, primordial fear.
p82
aVHe was overwhelmed not with conviction, but by doubt.
p83
aVAnd that panicked disorientation,
p84
aVthat sundering of everything familiar,
p85
aVthat daunting awareness of something
p86
aVbeyond human comprehension,
p87
aVcan only be called a terrible awe.
p88
aa(lp89
VThis might be somewhat difficult to grasp
p90
aVnow that we use the word "awesome"
p91
aVto describe a new app or a viral video.
p92
aVWith the exception perhaps of a massive earthquake,
p93
aVwe're protected from real awe.
p94
aVWe close the doors and hunker down,
p95
aVconvinced that we're in control,
p96
aVor, at least, hoping for control.
p97
aVWe do our best to ignore the fact that
p98
aVwe don't always have it,
p99
aVand that not everything can be explained.
p100
aVYet whether you're a rationalist or a mystic,
p101
aVwhether you think the words Muhammad heard that night
p102
aVcame from inside himself or from outside,
p103
aVwhat's clear is that he did experience them,
p104
aVand that he did so with a force that would shatter
p105
aVhis sense of himself and his world
p106
aVand transform this otherwise modest man
p107
aVinto a radical advocate for social and economic justice.
p108
aVFear was the only sane response,
p109
aVthe only human response.
p110
aa(lp111
VToo human for some,
p112
aVlike conservative Muslim theologians who maintain that
p113
aVthe account of his wanting to kill himself
p114
aVshouldn't even be mentioned, despite the fact
p115
aVthat it's in the earliest Islamic biographies.
p116
aVThey insist that he never doubted
p117
aVfor even a single moment, let alone despaired.
p118
aVDemanding perfection, they refuse to tolerate
p119
aVhuman imperfection.
p120
aVYet what, exactly, is imperfect about doubt?
p121
aVAs I read those early accounts, I realized it was
p122
aVprecisely Muhammad's doubt that brought him alive for me,
p123
aVthat allowed me to begin to see him in full,
p124
aVto accord him the integrity of reality.
p125
aVAnd the more I thought about it,
p126
aVthe more it made sense that he doubted,
p127
aVbecause doubt is essential to faith.
p128
aa(lp129
VIf this seems a startling idea at first,
p130
aVconsider that doubt, as Graham Greene once put it,
p131
aVis the heart of the matter.
p132
aVAbolish all doubt, and what's left is not faith,
p133
aVbut absolute, heartless conviction.
p134
aVYou're certain that you possess the Truth \u2014
p135
aVinevitably offered with an implied uppercase T \u2014
p136
aVand this certainty quickly devolves
p137
aVinto dogmatism and righteousness,
p138
aVby which I mean a demonstrative, overweening pride
p139
aVin being so very right,
p140
aVin short, the arrogance of fundamentalism.
p141
aVIt has to be one of the multiple ironies of history
p142
aVthat a favorite expletive of Muslim fundamentalists
p143
aVis the same one once used by the Christian fundamentalists
p144
aVknown as Crusaders:
p145
aV"infidel," from the Latin for "faithless."
p146
aVDoubly ironic, in this case, because their absolutism
p147
aVis in fact the opposite of faith.
p148
aVIn effect, they are the infidels.
p149
aVLike fundamentalists of all religious stripes,
p150
aVthey have no questions, only answers.
p151
aVThey found the perfect antidote to thought
p152
aVand the ideal refuge of the hard demands of real faith.
p153
aVThey don't have to struggle for it like Jacob
p154
aVwrestling through the night with the angel,
p155
aVor like Jesus in his 40 days and nights in the wilderness,
p156
aVor like Muhammad, not only that night on the mountain,
p157
aVbut throughout his years as a prophet,
p158
aVwith the Koran constantly urging him not to despair,
p159
aVand condemning those who most loudly proclaim
p160
aVthat they know everything there is to know
p161
aVand that they and they alone are right.
p162
aa(lp163
VAnd yet we, the vast and still far too silent majority,
p164
aVhave ceded the public arena to this extremist minority.
p165
aVWe've allowed Judaism to be claimed
p166
aVby violently messianic West Bank settlers,
p167
aVChristianity by homophobic hypocrites
p168
aVand misogynistic bigots,
p169
aVIslam by suicide bombers.
p170
aVAnd we've allowed ourselves to be blinded to the fact that
p171
aVno matter whether they claim to be Christians,
p172
aVJews or Muslims,
p173
aVmilitant extremists are none of the above.
p174
aVThey're a cult all their own, blood brothers
p175
aVsteeped in other people's blood.
p176
aa(lp177
VThis isn't faith.
p178
aVIt's fanaticism, and we have to stop confusing the two.
p179
aVWe have to recognize that real faith has no easy answers.
p180
aVIt's difficult and stubborn.
p181
aVIt involves an ongoing struggle,
p182
aVa continual questioning of what we think we know,
p183
aVa wrestling with issues and ideas.
p184
aVIt goes hand in hand with doubt,
p185
aVin a never-ending conversation with it,
p186
aVand sometimes in conscious defiance of it.
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd this conscious defiance is why I, as an agnostic,
p189
aVcan still have faith.
p190
aVI have faith, for instance, that peace in the Middle East
p191
aVis possible despite the ever-accumulating mass of evidence
p192
aVto the contrary.
p193
aVI'm not convinced of this.
p194
aVI can hardly say I believe it.
p195
aVI can only have faith in it,
p196
aVcommit myself, that is, to the idea of it,
p197
aVand I do this precisely because of the temptation
p198
aVto throw up my hands in resignation
p199
aVand retreat into silence.
p200
aa(lp201
VBecause despair is self-fulfilling.
p202
aVIf we call something impossible,
p203
aVwe act in such a way that we make it so.
p204
aVAnd I, for one, refuse to live that way.
p205
aVIn fact, most of us do,
p206
aVwhether we're atheist or theist
p207
aVor anywhere in between or beyond, for that matter,
p208
aVwhat drives us is that, despite our doubts
p209
aVand even because of our doubts,
p210
aVwe reject the nihilism of despair.
p211
aVWe insist on faith in the future
p212
aVand in each other.
p213
aVCall this naive if you like.
p214
aVCall it impossibly idealistic if you must.
p215
aVBut one thing is sure:
p216
aVCall it human.
p217
aa(lp218
VCould Muhammad have so radically changed his world
p219
aVwithout such faith, without the refusal
p220
aVto cede to the arrogance of closed-minded certainty?
p221
aVI think not.
p222
aVAfter keeping company with him as a writer
p223
aVfor the past five years, I can't see
p224
aVthat he'd be anything but utterly outraged
p225
aVat the militant fundamentalists who claim to speak
p226
aVand act in his name in the Middle East and elsewhere today.
p227
aVHe'd be appalled at the repression of half the population
p228
aVbecause of their gender.
p229
aVHe'd be torn apart by the bitter divisiveness of sectarianism.
p230
aVHe'd call out terrorism for what it is,
p231
aVnot only criminal but an obscene travesty
p232
aVof everything he believed in and struggled for.
p233
aVHe'd say what the Koran says: Anyone who takes a life
p234
aVtakes the life of all humanity.
p235
aVAnyone who saves a life, saves the life of all humanity.
p236
aVAnd he'd commit himself fully
p237
aVto the hard and thorny process of making peace.
