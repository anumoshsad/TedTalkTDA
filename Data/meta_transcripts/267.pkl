(lp3
VA few words about how I got started,
p4
aVand it has a lot to do with happiness, actually.
p5
aVWhen I was a very young child, I was extremely introverted
p6
aVand very much to myself.
p7
aVAnd, kind of as a way of surviving,
p8
aVI would go into my own very personal space,
p9
aVand I would make things.
p10
aVI would make things for people
p11
aVas a way of, you know, giving, showing them my love.
p12
aVI would go into these private places,
p13
aVand I would put my ideas and my passions into objects \u2014
p14
aVand sort of learning how to speak with my hands.
p15
aVSo, the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects
p16
aVis very much connected with not only the idea realm,
p17
aVbut also with very much the feeling realm.
p18
aVAnd the ideas are very disparate.
p19
aa(lp20
VI'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces,
p21
aVand there's no real connection between one or the other,
p22
aVexcept that they sort of come out of my brain,
p23
aVand they're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered
p24
aVby looking at life, and seeing nature and seeing objects,
p25
aVand just having kind of playful random thoughts about things.
p26
aa(lp27
VWhen I was a child, I started to explore motion.
p28
aVI fell in love with the way things moved,
p29
aVso I started to explore motion by making little flipbooks.
p30
aVAnd this is one that I did, probably like when I was around seventh grade,
p31
aVand I remember when I was doing this,
p32
aVI was thinking about that little rock there,
p33
aVand the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air,
p34
aVand how the characters \u2014
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter) \u2014
p37
aa(lp38
Vwould come shooting out of the car,
p39
aVso, on my mind, I was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles.
p40
aVAnd of course, when you're a little kid, there's always destruction.
p41
aVSo, it has to end with this \u2014
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter) \u2014
p44
aa(lp45
Vgratuitous violence.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VSo that was how I first started to explore the way things moved,
p50
aVand expressed it.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, when I went to college,
p53
aVI found myself making fairly complicated, fragile machines.
p54
aVAnd this really came about
p55
aVfrom having many different kinds of interests.
p56
aVWhen I was in high school, I loved to program computers,
p57
aVso I sort of liked the logical flow of events.
p58
aVI was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery
p59
aVand becoming a surgeon,
p60
aVbecause it meant working with my hands
p61
aVin a very focused, intense way.
p62
aVSo, I started taking art courses,
p63
aVand I found a way to make sculpture
p64
aVthat brought together my love for being very precise with my hands,
p65
aVwith coming up with different kinds of logical flows of energy through a system.
p66
aVAnd also, working with wire \u2014 everything that I did
p67
aVwas both a visual and a mechanical engineering decision
p68
aVat the same time.
p69
aVSo, I was able to sort of exercise all of that.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow, this kind of machine is as close as I can get to painting.
p72
aVAnd it's full of many little trivial end points,
p73
aVlike there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles
p74
aVand it doesn't really mean anything.
p75
aVIt's really just for the sort of joy of its own triviality.
p76
aVThe connection I have with engineering
p77
aVis the same as any other engineer, in that I love to solve problems.
p78
aVI love to figure things out,
p79
aVbut the end result of what I'm doing is really completely ambiguous.
p80
aa(lp81
V(Laughter)
p82
aa(lp83
VThat's pretty ambiguous.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VThe next piece that is going to come up
p88
aVis an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex.
p89
aVI gave myself the problem.
p90
aVSince I'm always liking to solve problems,
p91
aVI gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction,
p92
aVand solving all of the mechanical problems
p93
aVfor getting this little man to walk back and forth.
p94
aVSo, when I started this, I didn't have an overall plan for the machine,
p95
aVbut I did have a sense of the gesture,
p96
aVand a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space.
p97
aVAnd then it was a matter of starting from one point
p98
aVand sort of building to that final point.
p99
aVThat little gear there switches back and forth to change direction.
p100
aVAnd that's a little found object.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo a lot of the pieces that I've made,
p103
aVthey involve found objects.
p104
aVAnd it really \u2014 it's almost like doing visual puns all the time.
p105
aVWhen I see objects, I imagine them in motion.
p106
aVI imagine what can be said with them.
p107
aa(lp108
VThis next one here, "Machine with Wishbone,"
p109
aVit came about from playing with this wishbone after dinner.
p110
aVYou know, they say, never play with your food \u2014
p111
aVbut I always play with things.
p112
aVSo, I had this wishbone, and I thought,
p113
aVit's kind of like a cowboy who's been on his horse for too long.
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd I started to make him walk across the table,
p118
aVand I thought, "Oh, I can make a little machine that will do that."
p119
aVSo, I made this device, linked it up, and the wishbone walks.
p120
aVAnd because the wishbone is bone \u2014 it's animal \u2014
p121
aVit's sort of a point where I think we can enter into it.
p122
aVAnd that's the whole piece.
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VThat's about that big.
p127
aa(lp128
V(Applause)
p129
aa(lp130
VThis kind of work is also very much like puppetry,
p131
aVwhere the found object is, in a sense, the puppet,
p132
aVand I'm the puppeteer at first, because I'm playing with an object.
p133
aVBut then I make the machine, which is sort of the stand-in for me,
p134
aVand it is able to achieve the action that I want.
p135
aa(lp136
VThe next piece I'll show you is a much more conceptual thought,
p137
aVand it's a little piece called "Cory's Yellow Chair."
p138
aVI had this image in my mind, when I saw my son's little chair,
p139
aVand I saw it explode up and out.
p140
aVAnd \u2014
p141
aVso the way I saw this in my mind at first,
p142
aVwas that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed,
p143
aVand the pieces would move far out,
p144
aVand then they would begin to be pulled back
p145
aVwith a kind of a gravitational feel,
p146
aVto the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center.
p147
aVAnd they would coalesce for just a moment,
p148
aVso you could perceive that there was a chair there.
p149
aVFor me, it's kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment,
p150
aVand I wanted to express that.
p151
aVNow, the machine is \u2014 in this case, it's a real approximation of that,
p152
aVbecause obviously you can't move physical matter
p153
aVinfinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously.
p154
aVThis whole thing is about four feet wide,
p155
aVand the chair itself is only about a few inches.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Applause)
p158
aa(lp159
VNow, this is a funny sort of conceptual thing,
p160
aVand yesterday we were talking about Danny Hillis' "10,000 Year Clock."
p161
aVSo, we have a motor here on the left,
p162
aVand it goes through a gear train.
p163
aVThere are 12 pairs of 50:1 reductions,
p164
aVso that means that the final speed of that gear on the end
p165
aVis so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once.
p166
aVSo I've invented it in concrete, because it doesn't really matter.
p167
aa(lp168
V(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VBecause it could run all the time.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VNow, a completely different thought.
p175
aVI'm always imagining myself in different situations.
p176
aVI'm imagining myself as a machine.
p177
aVWhat would I love?
p178
aVI would love to be bathed in oil.
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VSo, this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil.
p183
aa(lp184
V(Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
V(Applause)
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd it's really, just sort of \u2014
p189
aVfor me, it was just really about the lusciousness of oil.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Laughter)
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd then, I got a call from a friend
p194
aVwho wanted to have a show of erotic art,
p195
aVand I didn't have any pieces.
p196
aVBut when she suggested to be in the show, this piece came to mind.
p197
aVSo, it's sort of related, but you can see it's much more overtly erotic.
p198
aVAnd this one I call "Machine with Grease."
p199
aVIt's just continually ejaculating, and it's \u2014
p200
aa(lp201
V(Laughter) \u2014
p202
aa(lp203
Vthis is a happy machine, I'll tell you.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VIt's definitely happy.
p208
aa(lp209
VFrom an engineering point of view,
p210
aVthis is just a little four-bar linkage.
p211
aVAnd then again, this is a found object, a little fan that I found.
p212
aVAnd I thought, what about the gesture of opening the fan,
p213
aVand how simply could I state something.
p214
aVAnd, in a case like this, I'm trying to make something which is clear
p215
aVbut also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant.
p216
aa(lp217
VFor me, the process is very important,
p218
aVbecause I'm inventing machines,
p219
aVbut I'm also inventing tools to make machines,
p220
aVand the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning.
p221
aVSo this is a little wire-bending tool.
p222
aVAfter many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers,
p223
aVI made that tool, and then I made this other tool
p224
aVfor sort of centering gears very quickly \u2014
p225
aVsort of developing my own little world of technology.
p226
aVMy life completely changed when I found a spot welder.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd that was that tool.
p231
aVIt completely changed what I could do.
p232
aVNow here, I'm going to do a very poor job of silver soldering.
p233
aVThis is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school.
p234
aVI just like, throw it in.
p235
aVI mean, real jewelers put little bits of solder in.
p236
aVSo, that's a finished gear.
p237
aa(lp238
VWhen I moved to Boston,
p239
aVI joined a group called the World Sculpture Racing Society.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Laughter)
p242
aa(lp243
VAnd the idea, their premise was that we wanted to show
p244
aVpieces of sculpture on the street,
p245
aVand there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best.
p246
aVIt would be \u2014 whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Laughter)
p249
aa(lp250
VSo I made \u2014 this is my first racing sculpture,
p251
aVand I thought, "Oh, I'm going to make a cart,
p252
aVand I'm going to have it \u2014
p253
aVI'm going to have my hand writing 'faster,'
p254
aVso as I run down the street, the cart's going to talk to me
p255
aVand it's going to go, 'Faster, faster!' "
p256
aVSo, that's what it does.
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VBut then in the end, what I decided
p261
aVwas every time you finish writing the word,
p262
aVI would stop and I would give the card to somebody on the side of the road.
p263
aVSo I would never win the race because I'm always stopping.
p264
aVBut I had a lot of fun.
p265
aa(lp266
V(Applause)
p267
aa(lp268
VNow, I only have two and a half minutes \u2014 I'm going to play this.
p269
aVThis is a piece that, for me, is in some ways
p270
aVthe most complete kind of piece.
p271
aVBecause when I was a kid, I also played a lot of guitar.
p272
aVAnd when I had this thought,
p273
aVI was imagining that I would make \u2014
p274
aVI would have a whole machine theater evening,
p275
aVwhere I would \u2014 you would have an audience,
p276
aVthe curtain would open, and you'd be entertained by machines on stage.
p277
aVSo, I imagined a very simple gestural dance
p278
aVthat would be between a machine and just a very simple chair, and ...
p279
aVWhen I'm making these pieces, I'm always trying to find a point
p280
aVwhere I'm saying something very clearly and it's very simple,
p281
aVbut also at the same time it's very ambiguous.
p282
aVAnd I think there's a point between simplicity and ambiguity
p283
aVwhich can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it.
p284
aa(lp285
VAnd that leads me to the thought that all of these pieces
p286
aVstart off in my own mind, in my heart,
p287
aVand I do my best at finding ways to express them with materials,
p288
aVand it always feels really crude.
p289
aVIt's always a struggle,
p290
aVbut somehow I manage to sort of get this thought
p291
aVout into an object, and then it's there, OK.
p292
aVIt means nothing at all.
p293
aVThe object itself just means nothing.
p294
aVOnce it's perceived, and someone brings it into their own mind,
p295
aVthen there's a cycle that has been completed.
p296
aVAnd to me, that's the most important thing
p297
aVbecause, ever since being a kid, I've wanted to communicate my passion and love.
p298
aVAnd that means the complete cycle of coming from inside,
p299
aVout to the physical, to someone perceiving it.
p300
aVSo I'll just let this chair come down.
p301
aa(lp302
V(Applause)
p303
aa(lp304
VThank you.
