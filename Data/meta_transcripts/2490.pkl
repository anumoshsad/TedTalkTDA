VFor the next 16 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey
p4
aVthat is probably the biggest dream of humanity:
p5
aVto understand the code of life.
p6
aa(lp7
VSo for me, everything started many, many years ago
p8
aVwhen I met the first 3D printer.
p9
aVThe concept was fascinating.
p10
aVA 3D printer needs three elements:
p11
aVa bit of information, some raw material, some energy,
p12
aVand it can produce any object that was not there before.
p13
aa(lp14
VI was doing physics, I was coming back home
p15
aVand I realized that I actually always knew a 3D printer.
p16
aVAnd everyone does.
p17
aVIt was my mom.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VMy mom takes three elements:
p22
aVa bit of information, which is between my father and my mom in this case,
p23
aVraw elements and energy in the same media, that is food,
p24
aVand after several months, produces me.
p25
aVAnd I was not existent before.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo apart from the shock of my mom discovering that she was a 3D printer,
p28
aVI immediately got mesmerized by that piece,
p29
aVthe first one, the information.
p30
aVWhat amount of information does it take
p31
aVto build and assemble a human?
p32
aVIs it much? Is it little?
p33
aVHow many thumb drives can you fill?
p34
aa(lp35
VWell, I was studying physics at the beginning
p36
aVand I took this approximation of a human as a gigantic Lego piece.
p37
aVSo, imagine that the building blocks are little atoms
p38
aVand there is a hydrogen here, a carbon here, a nitrogen here.
p39
aVSo in the first approximation,
p40
aVif I can list the number of atoms that compose a human being,
p41
aVI can build it.
p42
aVNow, you can run some numbers
p43
aVand that happens to be quite an astonishing number.
p44
aVSo the number of atoms,
p45
aVthe file that I will save in my thumb drive to assemble a little baby,
p46
aVwill actually fill an entire Titanic of thumb drives \u2014
p47
aVmultiplied 2,000 times.
p48
aVThis is the miracle of life.
p49
aVEvery time you see from now on a pregnant lady,
p50
aVshe's assembling the biggest amount of information
p51
aVthat you will ever encounter.
p52
aVForget big data, forget anything you heard of.
p53
aVThis is the biggest amount of information that exists.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Applause)
p56
aa(lp57
VBut nature, fortunately, is much smarter than a young physicist,
p58
aVand in four billion years, managed to pack this information
p59
aVin a small crystal we call DNA.
p60
aVWe met it for the first time in 1950 when Rosalind Franklin,
p61
aVan amazing scientist, a woman,
p62
aVtook a picture of it.
p63
aVBut it took us more than 40 years to finally poke inside a human cell,
p64
aVtake out this crystal,
p65
aVunroll it, and read it for the first time.
p66
aVThe code comes out to be a fairly simple alphabet,
p67
aVfour letters: A, T, C and G.
p68
aVAnd to build a human, you need three billion of them.
p69
aVThree billion.
p70
aVHow many are three billion?
p71
aVIt doesn't really make any sense as a number, right?
p72
aa(lp73
VSo I was thinking how I could explain myself better
p74
aVabout how big and enormous this code is.
p75
aVBut there is \u2014 I mean, I'm going to have some help,
p76
aVand the best person to help me introduce the code
p77
aVis actually the first man to sequence it, Dr. Craig Venter.
p78
aVSo welcome onstage, Dr. Craig Venter.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Applause)
p81
aa(lp82
VNot the man in the flesh,
p83
aVbut for the first time in history,
p84
aVthis is the genome of a specific human,
p85
aVprinted page-by-page, letter-by-letter:
p86
aV262,000 pages of information,
p87
aV450 kilograms, shipped from the United States to Canada
p88
aVthanks to Bruno Bowden, Lulu.com, a start-up, did everything.
p89
aVIt was an amazing feat.
p90
aa(lp91
VBut this is the visual perception of what is the code of life.
p92
aVAnd now, for the first time, I can do something fun.
p93
aVI can actually poke inside it and read.
p94
aVSo let me take an interesting book ... like this one.
p95
aVI have an annotation; it's a fairly big book.
p96
aVSo just to let you see what is the code of life.
p97
aVThousands and thousands and thousands
p98
aVand millions of letters.
p99
aVAnd they apparently make sense.
p100
aVLet's get to a specific part.
p101
aVLet me read it to you:
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
V"AAG, AAT, ATA."
p106
aa(lp107
VTo you it sounds like mute letters,
p108
aVbut this sequence gives the color of the eyes to Craig.
p109
aVI'll show you another part of the book.
p110
aVThis is actually a little more complicated.
p111
aa(lp112
VChromosome 14, book 132:
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VAs you might expect.
p117
aa(lp118
V(Laughter)
p119
aa(lp120
V"ATT, CTT, GATT."
p121
aa(lp122
VThis human is lucky,
p123
aVbecause if you miss just two letters in this position \u2014
p124
aVtwo letters of our three billion \u2014
p125
aVhe will be condemned to a terrible disease:
p126
aVcystic fibrosis.
p127
aVWe have no cure for it, we don't know how to solve it,
p128
aVand it's just two letters of difference from what we are.
p129
aa(lp130
VA wonderful book, a mighty book,
p131
aVa mighty book that helped me understand
p132
aVand show you something quite remarkable.
p133
aVEvery one of you \u2014 what makes me, me and you, you \u2014
p134
aVis just about five million of these,
p135
aVhalf a book.
p136
aVFor the rest,
p137
aVwe are all absolutely identical.
p138
aVFive hundred pages is the miracle of life that you are.
p139
aVThe rest, we all share it.
p140
aVSo think about that again when we think that we are different.
p141
aVThis is the amount that we share.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo now that I have your attention,
p144
aVthe next question is:
p145
aVHow do I read it?
p146
aVHow do I make sense out of it?
p147
aVWell, for however good you can be at assembling Swedish furniture,
p148
aVthis instruction manual is nothing you can crack in your life.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd so, in 2014, two famous TEDsters,
p153
aVPeter Diamandis and Craig Venter himself,
p154
aVdecided to assemble a new company.
p155
aVHuman Longevity was born,
p156
aVwith one mission:
p157
aVtrying everything we can try
p158
aVand learning everything we can learn from these books,
p159
aVwith one target \u2014
p160
aVmaking real the dream of personalized medicine,
p161
aVunderstanding what things should be done to have better health
p162
aVand what are the secrets in these books.
p163
aa(lp164
VAn amazing team, 40 data scientists and many, many more people,
p165
aVa pleasure to work with.
p166
aVThe concept is actually very simple.
p167
aVWe're going to use a technology called machine learning.
p168
aVOn one side, we have genomes \u2014 thousands of them.
p169
aVOn the other side, we collected the biggest database of human beings:
p170
aVphenotypes, 3D scan, NMR \u2014 everything you can think of.
p171
aVInside there, on these two opposite sides,
p172
aVthere is the secret of translation.
p173
aVAnd in the middle, we build a machine.
p174
aVWe build a machine and we train a machine \u2014
p175
aVwell, not exactly one machine, many, many machines \u2014
p176
aVto try to understand and translate the genome in a phenotype.
p177
aVWhat are those letters, and what do they do?
p178
aVIt's an approach that can be used for everything,
p179
aVbut using it in genomics is particularly complicated.
p180
aVLittle by little we grew and we wanted to build different challenges.
p181
aVWe started from the beginning, from common traits.
p182
aVCommon traits are comfortable because they are common,
p183
aVeveryone has them.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo we started to ask our questions:
p186
aVCan we predict height?
p187
aVCan we read the books and predict your height?
p188
aVWell, we actually can,
p189
aVwith five centimeters of precision.
p190
aVBMI is fairly connected to your lifestyle,
p191
aVbut we still can, we get in the ballpark, eight kilograms of precision.
p192
aVCan we predict eye color?
p193
aVYeah, we can.
p194
aVEighty percent accuracy.
p195
aVCan we predict skin color?
p196
aVYeah we can, 80 percent accuracy.
p197
aVCan we predict age?
p198
aVWe can, because apparently, the code changes during your life.
p199
aVIt gets shorter, you lose pieces, it gets insertions.
p200
aVWe read the signals, and we make a model.
p201
aa(lp202
VNow, an interesting challenge:
p203
aVCan we predict a human face?
p204
aVIt's a little complicated,
p205
aVbecause a human face is scattered among millions of these letters.
p206
aVAnd a human face is not a very well-defined object.
p207
aVSo, we had to build an entire tier of it
p208
aVto learn and teach a machine what a face is,
p209
aVand embed and compress it.
p210
aVAnd if you're comfortable with machine learning,
p211
aVyou understand what the challenge is here.
p212
aa(lp213
VNow, after 15 years \u2014 15 years after we read the first sequence \u2014
p214
aVthis October, we started to see some signals.
p215
aVAnd it was a very emotional moment.
p216
aVWhat you see here is a subject coming in our lab.
p217
aVThis is a face for us.
p218
aVSo we take the real face of a subject, we reduce the complexity,
p219
aVbecause not everything is in your face \u2014
p220
aVlots of features and defects and asymmetries come from your life.
p221
aVWe symmetrize the face, and we run our algorithm.
p222
aVThe results that I show you right now,
p223
aVthis is the prediction we have from the blood.
p224
aa(lp225
V(Applause)
p226
aa(lp227
VWait a second.
p228
aVIn these seconds, your eyes are watching, left and right, left and right,
p229
aVand your brain wants those pictures to be identical.
p230
aVSo I ask you to do another exercise, to be honest.
p231
aVPlease search for the differences,
p232
aVwhich are many.
p233
aVThe biggest amount of signal comes from gender,
p234
aVthen there is age, BMI, the ethnicity component of a human.
p235
aVAnd scaling up over that signal is much more complicated.
p236
aVBut what you see here, even in the differences,
p237
aVlets you understand that we are in the right ballpark,
p238
aVthat we are getting closer.
p239
aVAnd it's already giving you some emotions.
p240
aa(lp241
VThis is another subject that comes in place,
p242
aVand this is a prediction.
p243
aVA little smaller face, we didn't get the complete cranial structure,
p244
aVbut still, it's in the ballpark.
p245
aVThis is a subject that comes in our lab,
p246
aVand this is the prediction.
p247
aVSo these people have never been seen in the training of the machine.
p248
aVThese are the so-called "held-out" set.
p249
aVBut these are people that you will probably never believe.
p250
aVWe're publishing everything in a scientific publication,
p251
aVyou can read it.
p252
aa(lp253
VBut since we are onstage, Chris challenged me.
p254
aVI probably exposed myself and tried to predict
p255
aVsomeone that you might recognize.
p256
aVSo, in this vial of blood \u2014 and believe me, you have no idea
p257
aVwhat we had to do to have this blood now, here \u2014
p258
aVin this vial of blood is the amount of biological information
p259
aVthat we need to do a full genome sequence.
p260
aVWe just need this amount.
p261
aVWe ran this sequence, and I'm going to do it with you.
p262
aVAnd we start to layer up all the understanding we have.
p263
aVIn the vial of blood, we predicted he's a male.
p264
aVAnd the subject is a male.
p265
aVWe predict that he's a meter and 76 cm.
p266
aVThe subject is a meter and 77 cm.
p267
aVSo, we predicted that he's 76; the subject is 82.
p268
aVWe predict his age, 38.
p269
aVThe subject is 35.
p270
aVWe predict his eye color.
p271
aVToo dark.
p272
aVWe predict his skin color.
p273
aVWe are almost there.
p274
aVThat's his face.
p275
aa(lp276
VNow, the reveal moment:
p277
aVthe subject is this person.
p278
aa(lp279
V(Laughter)
p280
aa(lp281
VAnd I did it intentionally.
p282
aVI am a very particular and peculiar ethnicity.
p283
aVSouthern European, Italians \u2014 they never fit in models.
p284
aVAnd it's particular \u2014 that ethnicity is a complex corner case for our model.
p285
aVBut there is another point.
p286
aVSo, one of the things that we use a lot to recognize people
p287
aVwill never be written in the genome.
p288
aVIt's our free will, it's how I look.
p289
aVNot my haircut in this case, but my beard cut.
p290
aVSo I'm going to show you, I'm going to, in this case, transfer it \u2014
p291
aVand this is nothing more than Photoshop, no modeling \u2014
p292
aVthe beard on the subject.
p293
aVAnd immediately, we get much, much better in the feeling.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo, why do we do this?
p296
aVWe certainly don't do it for predicting height
p297
aVor taking a beautiful picture out of your blood.
p298
aVWe do it because the same technology and the same approach,
p299
aVthe machine learning of this code,
p300
aVis helping us to understand how we work,
p301
aVhow your body works,
p302
aVhow your body ages,
p303
aVhow disease generates in your body,
p304
aVhow your cancer grows and develops,
p305
aVhow drugs work
p306
aVand if they work on your body.
p307
aa(lp308
VThis is a huge challenge.
p309
aVThis is a challenge that we share
p310
aVwith thousands of other researchers around the world.
p311
aVIt's called personalized medicine.
p312
aVIt's the ability to move from a statistical approach
p313
aVwhere you're a dot in the ocean,
p314
aVto a personalized approach,
p315
aVwhere we read all these books
p316
aVand we get an understanding of exactly how you are.
p317
aVBut it is a particularly complicated challenge,
p318
aVbecause of all these books, as of today,
p319
aVwe just know probably two percent:
p320
aVfour books of more than 175.
p321
aa(lp322
VAnd this is not the topic of my talk,
p323
aVbecause we will learn more.
p324
aVThere are the best minds in the world on this topic.
p325
aVThe prediction will get better,
p326
aVthe model will get more precise.
p327
aVAnd the more we learn,
p328
aVthe more we will be confronted with decisions
p329
aVthat we never had to face before
p330
aVabout life,
p331
aVabout death,
p332
aVabout parenting.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo, we are touching the very inner detail on how life works.
p335
aVAnd it's a revolution that cannot be confined
p336
aVin the domain of science or technology.
p337
aVThis must be a global conversation.
p338
aVWe must start to think of the future we're building as a humanity.
p339
aVWe need to interact with creatives, with artists, with philosophers,
p340
aVwith politicians.
p341
aVEveryone is involved,
p342
aVbecause it's the future of our species.
p343
aVWithout fear, but with the understanding
p344
aVthat the decisions that we make in the next year
p345
aVwill change the course of history forever.
p346
