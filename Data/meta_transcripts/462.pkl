VIn his inaugural address,
p4
aVBarack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best
p5
aVas we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis.
p6
aVBut what did he appeal to?
p7
aVHe did not, happily, follow in the footsteps of his predecessor,
p8
aVand tell us to just go shopping.
p9
aVNor did he tell us, "Trust us. Trust your country.
p10
aVInvest, invest, invest."
p11
aVInstead, what he told us was to put aside childish things.
p12
aVAnd he appealed to virtue.
p13
aVVirtue is an old-fashioned word.
p14
aVIt seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one.
p15
aVAnd besides, some of you might be wondering,
p16
aVwhat the hell does it mean?
p17
aa(lp18
VLet me begin with an example.
p19
aVThis is the job description of a hospital janitor
p20
aVthat is scrolling up on the screen.
p21
aVAnd all of the items on it are unremarkable.
p22
aVThey're the things you would expect:
p23
aVmop the floors, sweep them, empty the trash, restock the cabinets.
p24
aVIt may be a little surprising how many things there are,
p25
aVbut it's not surprising what they are.
p26
aVBut the one thing I want you to notice about them is this:
p27
aVeven though this is a very long list,
p28
aVthere isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings.
p29
aVNot one.
p30
aVThe janitor's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital.
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd yet, when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors
p33
aVto get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like,
p34
aVthey encountered Mike,
p35
aVwho told them about how he stopped mopping the floor
p36
aVbecause Mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise,
p37
aVtrying to build up his strength, walking slowly up and down the hall.
p38
aVAnd Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor's admonition
p39
aVand didn't vacuum the visitor's lounge
p40
aVbecause there were some family members who were there all day, every day
p41
aVwho, at this moment, happened to be taking a nap.
p42
aVAnd then there was Luke,
p43
aVwho washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice
p44
aVbecause the man's father, who had been keeping a vigil for six months,
p45
aVdidn't see Luke do it the first time,
p46
aVand his father was angry.
p47
aVAnd behavior like this from janitors, from technicians, from nurses
p48
aVand, if we're lucky now and then, from doctors,
p49
aVdoesn't just make people feel a little better,
p50
aVit actually improves the quality of patient care
p51
aVand enables hospitals to run well.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, not all janitors are like this, of course.
p54
aVBut the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions
p55
aVinvolving kindness, care and empathy
p56
aVare an essential part of the job.
p57
aVAnd yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings.
p58
aVThese janitors have the moral will to do right by other people.
p59
aVAnd beyond this, they have the moral skill to figure out what "doing right" means.
p60
aa(lp61
V"Practical wisdom," Aristotle told us,
p62
aV"is the combination of moral will and moral skill."
p63
aVA wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule,
p64
aVas the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives.
p65
aVA wise person knows how to improvise,
p66
aVas Luke did when he re-washed the floor.
p67
aVReal-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined
p68
aVand the context is always changing.
p69
aVA wise person is like a jazz musician \u2014
p70
aVusing the notes on the page, but dancing around them,
p71
aVinventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand.
p72
aVA wise person knows how to use these moral skills
p73
aVin the service of the right aims.
p74
aVTo serve other people, not to manipulate other people.
p75
aVAnd finally, perhaps most important,
p76
aVa wise person is made, not born.
p77
aVWisdom depends on experience,
p78
aVand not just any experience.
p79
aVYou need the time to get to know the people that you're serving.
p80
aVYou need permission to be allowed to improvise,
p81
aVtry new things, occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures.
p82
aVAnd you need to be mentored by wise teachers.
p83
aa(lp84
VWhen you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described
p85
aVhow hard it is to learn to do their job,
p86
aVthey tell you that it takes lots of experience.
p87
aVAnd they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans.
p88
aVIt takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people.
p89
aVAt TED, brilliance is rampant.
p90
aVIt's scary.
p91
aVThe good news is you don't need to be brilliant to be wise.
p92
aVThe bad news is that without wisdom,
p93
aVbrilliance isn't enough.
p94
aVIt's as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else.
p95
aV(Applause)
p96
aa(lp97
VNow, I hope that we all know this.
p98
aVThere's a sense in which it's obvious,
p99
aVand yet, let me tell you a little story.
p100
aVIt's a story about lemonade.
p101
aVA dad and his seven-year-old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark.
p102
aVHis son asked him for some lemonade
p103
aVand Dad went to the concession stand to buy it.
p104
aVAll they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade,
p105
aVwhich was five percent alcohol.
p106
aVDad, being an academic, had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade contained alcohol.
p107
aVSo he brought it back.
p108
aVAnd the kid was drinking it, and a security guard spotted it,
p109
aVand called the police, who called an ambulance
p110
aVthat rushed to the ballpark, whisked the kid to the hospital.
p111
aVThe emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood.
p112
aVAnd they were ready to let the kid go.
p113
aa(lp114
VBut not so fast.
p115
aVThe Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no.
p116
aVAnd the child was sent to a foster home for three days.
p117
aVAt that point, can the child go home?
p118
aVWell, a judge said yes, but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel.
p119
aVAfter two weeks, I'm happy to report,
p120
aVthe family was reunited.
p121
aVBut the welfare workers and the ambulance people
p122
aVand the judge all said the same thing:
p123
aV"We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure."
p124
aa(lp125
VHow do things like this happen?
p126
aVScott Simon, who told this story on NPR,
p127
aVsaid, "Rules and procedures may be dumb,
p128
aVbut they spare you from thinking."
p129
aVAnd, to be fair, rules are often imposed
p130
aVbecause previous officials have been lax
p131
aVand they let a child go back to an abusive household.
p132
aVFair enough.
p133
aVWhen things go wrong, as of course they do,
p134
aVwe reach for two tools to try to fix them.
p135
aa(lp136
VOne tool we reach for is rules.
p137
aVBetter ones, more of them.
p138
aVThe second tool we reach for is incentives.
p139
aVBetter ones, more of them.
p140
aVWhat else, after all, is there?
p141
aVWe can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis.
p142
aVRegulate, regulate, regulate.
p143
aVFix the incentives, fix the incentives, fix the incentives ...
p144
aVThe truth is that neither rules nor incentives
p145
aVare enough to do the job.
p146
aVHow could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did?
p147
aVAnd would you pay them a bonus for being empathic?
p148
aVIt's preposterous on its face.
p149
aVAnd what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules,
p150
aVrules and incentives may make things better in the short run,
p151
aVbut they create a downward spiral
p152
aVthat makes them worse in the long run.
p153
aVMoral skill is chipped away by an over-reliance on rules
p154
aVthat deprives us of the opportunity
p155
aVto improvise and learn from our improvisations.
p156
aVAnd moral will is undermined
p157
aVby an incessant appeal to incentives
p158
aVthat destroy our desire to do the right thing.
p159
aVAnd without intending it,
p160
aVby appealing to rules and incentives,
p161
aVwe are engaging in a war on wisdom.
p162
aa(lp163
VLet me just give you a few examples,
p164
aVfirst of rules and the war on moral skill.
p165
aVThe lemonade story is one.
p166
aVSecond, no doubt more familiar to you,
p167
aVis the nature of modern American education:
p168
aVscripted, lock-step curricula.
p169
aVHere's an example from Chicago kindergarten.
p170
aVReading and enjoying literature
p171
aVand words that begin with 'B.'
p172
aV"The Bath:" Assemble students on a rug
p173
aVand give students a warning about the dangers of hot water.
p174
aVSay 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book.
p175
aVAll over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city,
p176
aVevery teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day.
p177
aVWe know why these scripts are there.
p178
aVWe don't trust the judgment of teachers enough
p179
aVto let them loose on their own.
p180
aVScripts like these are insurance policies against disaster.
p181
aVAnd they prevent disaster.
p182
aVBut what they assure in its place is mediocrity.
p183
aV(Applause)
p184
aa(lp185
VDon't get me wrong. We need rules!
p186
aVJazz musicians need some notes \u2014
p187
aVmost of them need some notes on the page.
p188
aVWe need more rules for the bankers, God knows.
p189
aVBut too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians
p190
aVfrom improvising.
p191
aVAnd as a result, they lose their gifts,
p192
aVor worse, they stop playing altogether.
p193
aa(lp194
VNow, how about incentives?
p195
aVThey seem cleverer.
p196
aVIf you have one reason for doing something
p197
aVand I give you a second reason for doing the same thing,
p198
aVit seems only logical that two reasons are better than one
p199
aVand you're more likely to do it.
p200
aVRight?
p201
aVWell, not always.
p202
aVSometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another
p203
aVinstead of complimenting,
p204
aVand they make people less likely to do it.
p205
aa(lp206
VI'll just give you one example because time is racing.
p207
aVIn Switzerland, back about 15 years ago,
p208
aVthey were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps.
p209
aVThere was going to be a national referendum.
p210
aVSome psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed.
p211
aVAnd they said, "Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"
p212
aVAstonishingly, 50 percent of the citizens said yes.
p213
aVThey knew it was dangerous.
p214
aVThey thought it would reduce their property values.
p215
aVBut it had to go somewhere
p216
aVand they had responsibilities as citizens.
p217
aVThe psychologists asked other people a slightly different question.
p218
aVThey said, "If we paid you six weeks' salary every year
p219
aVwould you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"
p220
aVTwo reasons. It's my responsibility and I'm getting paid.
p221
aVInstead of 50 percent saying yes,
p222
aV25 percent said yes.
p223
aVWhat happens is that
p224
aVthe second this introduction of incentive gets us
p225
aVso that instead of asking, "What is my responsibility?"
p226
aVall we ask is, "What serves my interests?"
p227
aVWhen incentives don't work,
p228
aVwhen CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies
p229
aVin pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses,
p230
aVthe response is always the same.
p231
aVGet smarter incentives.
p232
aa(lp233
VThe truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise
p234
aVthat are ever going to be smart enough.
p235
aVAny incentive system can be subverted by bad will.
p236
aVWe need incentives. People have to make a living.
p237
aVBut excessive reliance on incentives
p238
aVdemoralizes professional activity
p239
aVin two senses of that word.
p240
aVIt causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale
p241
aVand it causes the activity itself to lose morality.
p242
aa(lp243
VBarack Obama said, before he was inaugurated,
p244
aV"We must ask not just 'Is it profitable?' but 'Is it right?'"
p245
aVAnd when professions are demoralized,
p246
aVeveryone in them becomes dependent on \u2014 addicted to \u2014 incentives
p247
aVand they stop asking "Is it right?"
p248
aVWe see this in medicine.
p249
aV("Although it's nothing serious, let's keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't turn into a major lawsuit.")
p250
aVAnd we certainly see it in the world of business.
p251
aV("In order to remain competitive in today's marketplace, I'm afraid we're going to have to replace you with a sleezeball.")
p252
aV("I sold my soul for about a tenth of what the damn things are going for now.")
p253
aVIt is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo what can we do?
p256
aVA few sources of hope:
p257
aVwe ought to try to re-moralize work.
p258
aVOne way not to do it: teach more ethics courses.
p259
aV(Applause)
p260
aVThere is no better way to show people that you're not serious
p261
aVthan to tie up everything you have to say about ethics
p262
aVinto a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course.
p263
aa(lp264
VWhat to do instead?
p265
aVOne: Celebrate moral exemplars.
p266
aVAcknowledge, when you go to law school,
p267
aVthat a little voice is whispering in your ear
p268
aVabout Atticus Finch.
p269
aVNo 10-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions.
p270
aVPeople are inspired by moral heroes.
p271
aVBut we learn that with sophistication
p272
aVcomes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes.
p273
aVWell, acknowledge them.
p274
aVBe proud that you have them.
p275
aVCelebrate them.
p276
aVAnd demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too.
p277
aVThat's one thing we can do.
p278
aa(lp279
VI don't know how many of you remember this:
p280
aVanother moral hero, 15 years ago, Aaron Feuerstein,
p281
aVwho was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts \u2014
p282
aVthey made Polartec \u2014
p283
aVThe factory burned down.
p284
aV3,000 employees. He kept every one of them on the payroll.
p285
aVWhy? Because it would have been a disaster for them
p286
aVand for the community if he had let them go.
p287
aV"Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street,
p288
aVbut I can tell you it's worth more. We're doing fine."
p289
aa(lp290
VJust at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes.
p291
aVTwo were particularly inspiring to me.
p292
aVOne was Ray Anderson, who turned \u2014
p293
aV(Applause)
p294
aV\u2014 turned, you know, a part of the evil empire
p295
aVinto a zero-footprint, or almost zero-footprint business.
p296
aVWhy? Because it was the right thing to do.
p297
aVAnd a bonus he's discovering is
p298
aVhe's actually going to make even more money.
p299
aVHis employees are inspired by the effort.
p300
aVWhy? Because there happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do.
p301
aVYesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re-foresting in Indonesia.
p302
aV(Applause)
p303
aa(lp304
VIn many ways this is the perfect example.
p305
aVBecause it took the will to do the right thing.
p306
aVGod knows it took a huge amount of technical skill.
p307
aVI'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know
p308
aVin order to plot this out.
p309
aVBut most important to make it work \u2014
p310
aVand he emphasized this \u2014
p311
aVis that it took knowing the people in the communities.
p312
aVUnless the people you're working with are behind you,
p313
aVthis will fail.
p314
aVAnd there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you,
p315
aVbecause different people in different communities
p316
aVorganize their lives in different ways.
p317
aa(lp318
VSo there's a lot here at TED, and at other places, to celebrate.
p319
aVAnd you don't have to be a mega-hero.
p320
aVThere are ordinary heroes.
p321
aVOrdinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too.
p322
aVAs practitioners each and every one of us should strive
p323
aVto be ordinary, if not extraordinary heroes.
p324
aVAs heads of organizations,
p325
aVwe should strive to create environments
p326
aVthat encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will.
p327
aVEven the wisest and most well-meaning people
p328
aVwill give up if they have to swim against the current
p329
aVin the organizations in which they work.
p330
aa(lp331
VIf you run an organization, you should be sure
p332
aVthat none of the jobs \u2014 none of the jobs \u2014
p333
aVhave job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors.
p334
aVBecause the truth is that
p335
aVany work that you do that involves interaction with other people
p336
aVis moral work.
p337
aVAnd any moral work depends upon practical wisdom.
p338
aa(lp339
VAnd, perhaps most important,
p340
aVas teachers, we should strive to be the ordinary heroes,
p341
aVthe moral exemplars, to the people we mentor.
p342
aVAnd there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers.
p343
aVOne is that we are always teaching.
p344
aVSomeone is always watching.
p345
aVThe camera is always on.
p346
aVBill Gates talked about the importance of education
p347
aVand, in particular, the model that KIPP was providing:
p348
aV"Knowledge is power."
p349
aVAnd he talked about a lot of the wonderful things
p350
aVthat KIPP is doing
p351
aVto take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college.
p352
aa(lp353
VI want to focus on one particular thing KIPP is doing
p354
aVthat Bill didn't mention.
p355
aVThat is that they have come to the realization
p356
aVthat the single most important thing kids need to learn
p357
aVis character.
p358
aVThey need to learn to respect themselves.
p359
aVThey need to learn to respect their schoolmates.
p360
aVThey need to learn to respect their teachers.
p361
aVAnd, most important, they need to learn to respect learning.
p362
aVThat's the principle objective.
p363
aVIf you do that, the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill.
p364
aVAnd the teachers: the way you teach these things to the kids
p365
aVis by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day.
p366
aa(lp367
VObama appealed to virtue.
p368
aVAnd I think he was right.
p369
aVAnd the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom,
p370
aVbecause it's what allows other virtues \u2014 honesty, kindness, courage and so on \u2014
p371
aVto be displayed at the right time and in the right way.
p372
aVHe also appealed to hope.
p373
aVRight again.
p374
aVI think there is reason for hope.
p375
aVI think people want to be allowed to be virtuous.
p376
aa(lp377
VIn many ways, it's what TED is all about.
p378
aVWanting to do the right thing
p379
aVin the right way
p380
aVfor the right reasons.
p381
aVThis kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us
p382
aVif only we start paying attention.
p383
aVPaying attention to what we do,
p384
aVto how we do it,
p385
aVand, perhaps most importantly,
p386
aVto the structure of the organizations within which we work,
p387
aVso as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom
p388
aVrather than having it suppressed.
p389
aa(lp390
VThank you very much.
p391
aVThank you.
p392
aV(Applause)
p393
aa(lp394
