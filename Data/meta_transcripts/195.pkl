VI want you to imagine that you're a student in my lab.
p4
aVWhat I want you to do is to create a biologically inspired design.
p5
aVAnd so here's the challenge:
p6
aVI want you to help me create a fully 3D, dynamic, parameterized contact model.
p7
aVThe translation of that is, could you help me build a foot?
p8
aVAnd it is a true challenge, and I do want you to help me.
p9
aVOf course, in the challenge there is a prize.
p10
aVIt's not quite the TED Prize, but it is an exclusive t-shirt from our lab.
p11
aVSo please send me your ideas about how to design a foot.
p12
aa(lp13
VNow if we want to design a foot, what do we have to do?
p14
aVWe have to first know what a foot is.
p15
aVIf we go to the dictionary, it says, "It's the lower extremity of a leg
p16
aVthat is in direct contact with the ground in standing or walking"
p17
aVThat's the traditional definition.
p18
aVBut if you wanted to really do research, what do you have to do?
p19
aVYou have to go to the literature and look up what's known about feet.
p20
aVSo you go to the literature. (Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VMaybe you're familiar with this literature.
p23
aVThe problem is, there are many, many feet.
p24
aVHow do you do this?
p25
aVYou need to survey all feet and extract the principles of how they work.
p26
aVAnd I want you to help me do that in this next clip.
p27
aVAs you see this clip, look for principles,
p28
aVand also think about experiments that you might design
p29
aVin order to understand how a foot works.
p30
aa(lp31
VSee any common themes? Principles?
p32
aVWhat would you do?
p33
aVWhat experiments would you run?
p34
aVWow. (Applause)
p35
aVOur research on the biomechanics of animal locomotion
p36
aVhas allowed us to make a blueprint for a foot.
p37
aVIt's a design inspired by nature, but it's not a copy of any specific foot you just looked at,
p38
aVbut it's a synthesis of the secrets of many, many feet.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow it turns out that animals can go anywhere.
p41
aVThey can locomote on substrates that vary as you saw \u2014
p42
aVin the probability of contact, the movement of that surface
p43
aVand the type of footholds that are present.
p44
aVIf you want to study how a foot works,
p45
aVwe're going to have to simulate those surfaces, or simulate that debris.
p46
aVWhen we did that, here's a new experiment that we did:
p47
aVwe put an animal and had it run \u2014 this grass spider \u2014
p48
aVon a surface with 99 percent of the contact area removed.
p49
aVBut it didn't even slow down the animal.
p50
aVIt's still running at the human equivalent of 300 miles per hour.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow how could it do that? Well, look more carefully.
p53
aVWhen we slow it down 50 times we see how the leg is hitting that simulated debris.
p54
aVThe leg is acting as a foot.
p55
aVAnd in fact, the animal contacts other parts of its leg
p56
aVmore frequently than the traditionally defined foot.
p57
aVThe foot is distributed along the whole leg.
p58
aVYou can do another experiment where you can take a cockroach with a foot,
p59
aVand you can remove its foot.
p60
aVI'm passing some cockroaches around. Take a look at their feet.
p61
aVWithout a foot, here's what it does. It doesn't even slow down.
p62
aVIt can run the same speed without even that segment.
p63
aVNo problem for the cockroach \u2014 they can grow them back, if you care.
p64
aVHow do they do it?
p65
aVLook carefully: this is slowed down 100 times,
p66
aVand watch what it's doing with the rest of its leg.
p67
aVIt's acting, again, as a distributed foot \u2014
p68
aVvery effective.
p69
aa(lp70
VNow, the question we had is, how general is a distributed foot?
p71
aVAnd the next behavior I'll show you of this animal just stunned us the first time that we saw it.
p72
aVJournalists, this is off the record; it's embargoed.
p73
aVTake a look at what that is!
p74
aVThat's a bipedal octopus that's disguised as a rolling coconut.
p75
aVIt was discovered by Christina Huffard
p76
aVand filmed by Sea Studios, right here from Monterey.
p77
aa(lp78
VWe've also described another species of bipedal octopus.
p79
aVThis one disguises itself as floating algae.
p80
aVIt walks on two legs and it holds the other arms up in the air so that it can't be seen.
p81
aV(Applause)
p82
aVAnd look what it does with its foot to get over challenging terrain.
p83
aVIt uses that beautiful distributed foot to make it as if those obstacles are not even there \u2014
p84
aVtruly extraordinary.
p85
aa(lp86
VIn 1951, Escher made this drawing. He thought he created an animal fantasy.
p87
aVBut we know that art imitates life,
p88
aVand it turns out nature, three million years ago, evolved the next animal.
p89
aVIt's a shrimp-like animal called the stomatopod,
p90
aVand here's how it moves on the beaches of Panama:
p91
aVit actually rolls, and it can even roll uphill.
p92
aVIt's the ultimate distributed foot: its whole body in this case is acting like its foot.
p93
aa(lp94
VSo, if we want to then, to our blueprint, add the first important feature,
p95
aVwe want to add distributed foot contact.
p96
aVNot just with the traditional foot, but also the leg,
p97
aVand even of the body.
p98
aVCan this help us inspire the design of novel robots?
p99
aVWe biologically inspired this robot, named RHex,
p100
aVbuilt by these extraordinary engineers over the last few years.
p101
aVRHex's foot started off to be quite simple,
p102
aVthen it got tuned over time, and ultimately resulted in this half circle.
p103
aVWhy is that? The video will show you.
p104
aVWatch where the robot, now, contacts its leg in order to deal with this very difficult terrain.
p105
aVWhat you'll see, in fact, is that it's using that half circle leg as a distributed foot.
p106
aVWatch it go over this.
p107
aVYou can see it here well on this debris.
p108
aVExtraordinary. No sensing, all the control is built right into the tuned legs.
p109
aVReally simple, but beautiful.
p110
aa(lp111
VNow, you might have noticed something else about the animals
p112
aVwhen they were running over the rough terrain.
p113
aVAnd my assistant's going to help me here.
p114
aVWhen you touched the cockroach leg \u2014 can you get the microphone for him?
p115
aVWhen you touched the cockroach leg, what did it feel like?
p116
aVDid you notice something?
p117
aa(lp118
VBoy: Spiny.
p119
aa(lp120
VRobert Full: It's spiny, right? It's really spiny, isn't it? It sort of hurts.
p121
aVMaybe we could give it to our curator and see if he'd be brave enough to touch the cockroach.
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VChris Anderson: Did you touch it?
p125
aa(lp126
VRF: So if you look carefully at this, what you see is that they have spines
p127
aVand until a few weeks ago, no one knew what they did.
p128
aVThey assumed that they were for protection and for sensory structures.
p129
aVWe found that they're for something else \u2014 here's a segment of that spine.
p130
aVThey're tuned such that they easily collapse in one direction
p131
aVto pull the leg out from debris,
p132
aVbut they're stiff in the other direction so they capture disparities in the surface.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow crabs don't miss footholds, because they normally move on sand \u2014
p135
aVuntil they come to our lab.
p136
aVAnd where they have a problem with this kind of mesh,
p137
aVbecause they don't have spines.
p138
aVThe crabs are missing spines, so they have a problem in this kind of rough terrain.
p139
aVBut of course, we can deal with that
p140
aVbecause we can produce artificial spines.
p141
aVWe can make spines that catch on simulated debris
p142
aVand collapse on removal to easily pull them out.
p143
aVWe did that by putting these artificial spines on crabs,
p144
aVas you see here, and then we tested them.
p145
aVDo we really understand that principle of tuning? The answer is, yes!
p146
aVThis is slowed down 20-fold, and the crab just zooms across that simulated debris.
p147
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p148
aVA little better than nature.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo to our blueprint, we need to add tuned spines.
p151
aVNow will this help us think about the design of more effective climbing robots?
p152
aVWell, here's RHex: RHex has trouble on rails \u2014 on smooth rails, as you see here.
p153
aVSo why not add a spine? My colleagues did this at U. Penn.
p154
aVDan Koditschek put some steel nails \u2014 very simple version \u2014 on the robot,
p155
aVand here's RHex, now, going over those steel \u2014 those rails. No problem!
p156
aVHow does it do it?
p157
aVLet's slow it down and you can see the spines in action.
p158
aVWatch the leg come around, and you'll see it grab on right there.
p159
aVIt couldn't do that before; it would just slip and get stuck and tip over.
p160
aVAnd watch again, right there \u2014 successful.
p161
aa(lp162
VNow just because we have a distributed foot and spines
p163
aVdoesn't mean you can climb vertical surfaces.
p164
aVThis is really, really difficult.
p165
aVBut look at this animal do it!
p166
aVOne of the ones I'm passing around is climbing up this vertical surface that's a smooth metal plate.
p167
aVIt's extraordinary how fast it can do it \u2014
p168
aVbut if you slow it down, you see something that's quite extraordinary.
p169
aVIt's a secret. The animal effectively climbs by slipping and look \u2014
p170
aVand doing, actually, terribly, with respect to grabbing on the surface.
p171
aVIt looks, in fact, like it's swimming up the surface.
p172
aVWe can actually model that behavior better as a fluid, if you look at it.
p173
aVThe distributed foot, actually, is working more like a paddle.
p174
aa(lp175
VThe same is true when we looked at this lizard running on fluidized sand.
p176
aVWatch its feet.
p177
aVIt's actually functioning as a paddle
p178
aVeven though it's interacting with a surface that we normally think of as a solid.
p179
aVThis is not different from what my former undergraduate discovered
p180
aVwhen she figured out how lizards can run on water itself.
p181
aVCan you use this to make a better robot?
p182
aVMartin Buehler did \u2014 who's now at Boston Dynamics \u2014
p183
aVhe took this idea and made RHex to be Aqua RHex.
p184
aVSo here's RHex with paddles,
p185
aVnow converted into an incredibly maneuverable swimming robot.
p186
aa(lp187
VFor rough surfaces, though, animals add claws.
p188
aVAnd you probably feel them if you grabbed it.
p189
aVDid you touch it?
p190
aa(lp191
VCA: I did.
p192
aa(lp193
VRF: And they do really well at grabbing onto surfaces with these claws.
p194
aVMark Cutkosky at Stanford University, one of my collaborators, is an extraordinary engineer
p195
aVwho developed this technique called Shape Deposition Manufacturing,
p196
aVwhere he can imbed claws right into an artificial foot.
p197
aVAnd here's the simple version of a foot for a new robot that I'll show you in a bit.
p198
aVSo to our blueprint, let's attach claws.
p199
aVNow if we look at animals, though, to be really maneuverable in all surfaces,
p200
aVthe animals use hybrid mechanisms
p201
aVthat include claws, and spines, and hairs, and pads, and glue, and capillary adhesion
p202
aVand a whole bunch of other things.
p203
aVThese are all from different insects.
p204
aVThere's an ant crawling up a vertical surface.
p205
aVLet's look at that ant.
p206
aa(lp207
VThis is the foot of an ant. You see the hairs and the claws and this thing here.
p208
aVThis is when its foot's in the air.
p209
aVWatch what happens when the foot goes onto your sandwich.
p210
aVYou see what happens?
p211
aVThat pad comes out. And that's where the glue is.
p212
aVHere from underneath is an ant foot,
p213
aVand when the claws don't dig in, that pad automatically comes out without the ant doing anything.
p214
aVIt just extrudes.
p215
aVAnd this was a hard shot to get \u2014 I think this is the shot of the ant foot on the superstrings.
p216
aVSo it's pretty tough to do.
p217
aVThis is what it looks like close up \u2014
p218
aVhere's the ant foot, and there's the glue.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd we discovered this glue may be an interesting two-phase mixture.
p221
aVIt certainly helps it to hold on.
p222
aVSo to our blueprint, we stick on some sticky pads.
p223
aVNow you might think for smooth surfaces we get inspiration here.
p224
aVNow we have something better here.
p225
aVThe gecko's a really great example of nanotechnology in nature.
p226
aVThese are its feet.
p227
aVThey're \u2014 almost look alien. And the secret, which they stick on with,
p228
aVinvolves their hairy toes.
p229
aVThey can run up a surface at a meter per second,
p230
aVtake 30 steps in that one second \u2014 you can hardly see them.
p231
aVIf we slow it down, they attach their feet at eight milliseconds,
p232
aVand detach them in 16 milliseconds.
p233
aVAnd when you watch how they detach it, it is bizarre.
p234
aVThey peel away from the surface like you'd peel away a piece of tape.
p235
aVVery strange. How do they stick?
p236
aa(lp237
VIf you look at their feet, they have leaf-like structures called linalae
p238
aVwith millions of hairs.
p239
aVAnd each hair has the worst case of split ends possible.
p240
aVIt has a hundred to a thousand split ends,
p241
aVand that's the secret, because it allows intimate contact.
p242
aVThe gecko has a billion of these 200-nanometer-sized split ends.
p243
aVAnd they don't stick by glue, or they don't work like Velcro, or they don't work with suction.
p244
aVWe discovered they work by intermolecular forces alone.
p245
aVSo to our blueprint, we split some hairs.
p246
aVThis has inspired the design of the first self-cleaning dry adhesive \u2014
p247
aVthe patent issued, we're happy to say.
p248
aVAnd here's the simplest version in nature,
p249
aVand here's my collaborator Ron Fearing's attempt
p250
aVat an artificial version of this dry adhesive made from polyurethane.
p251
aVAnd here's the first attempt to have it work on some load.
p252
aa(lp253
VThere's enormous interest in this in a variety of different fields.
p254
aVYou could think of a thousand possible uses, I'm sure.
p255
aVLots of people have, and we're excited about realizing this as a product.
p256
aVWe have imagined products; for example, this one:
p257
aVwe imagined a bio-inspired Band-Aid, where we took the glue off the Band-Aid.
p258
aVWe took some hairs from a molting gecko;
p259
aVput three rolls of them on here, and then made this Band-Aid.
p260
aa(lp261
VThis is an undergraduate volunteer \u2014
p262
aVwe have 30,000 undergraduates so we can choose among them \u2014
p263
aVthat's actually just a red pen mark.
p264
aVBut it makes an incredible Band-Aid.
p265
aVIt's aerated, it can be peeled off easily, it doesn't cause any irritation, it works underwater.
p266
aVI think this is an extraordinary example of how curiosity-based research \u2014
p267
aVwe just wondered how they climbed up something \u2014
p268
aVcan lead to things that you could never imagine.
p269
aVIt's just an example of why we need to support curiosity-based research.
p270
aVHere you are, pulling off the Band-Aid.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo we've redefined, now, what a foot is.
p273
aVThe question is, can we use these secrets, then,
p274
aVto inspire the design of a better foot, better than one that we see in nature?
p275
aVHere's the new project:
p276
aVwe're trying to create the first climbing search-and-rescue robot \u2014 no suction or magnets \u2014
p277
aVthat can only move on limited kinds of surfaces.
p278
aVI call the new robot RiSE, for "Robot in Scansorial Environment" \u2014 that's a climbing environment \u2014
p279
aVand we have an extraordinary team of biologists and engineers creating this robot.
p280
aVAnd here is RiSE.
p281
aVIt's six-legged and has a tail. Here it is on a fence and a tree.
p282
aVAnd here are RiSE's first steps on an incline.
p283
aVYou have the audio? You can hear it go up.
p284
aVAnd here it is coming up at you, in its first steps up a wall.
p285
aVNow it's only using its simplest feet here, so this is very new.
p286
aVBut we think we got the dynamics right of the robot.
p287
aa(lp288
VMark Cutkosky, though, is taking it a step further.
p289
aVHe's the one able to build this shape-deposition manufactured feet and toes.
p290
aVThe next step is to make compliant toes,
p291
aVand try to add spines and claws and set it for dry adhesives.
p292
aVSo the idea is to first get the toes and a foot right,
p293
aVattempt to make that climb, and ultimately put it on the robot.
p294
aVAnd that's exactly what he's done.
p295
aVHe's built, in fact, a climbing foot-bot inspired by nature.
p296
aa(lp297
VAnd here's Cutkosky's and his amazing students' design.
p298
aVSo these are tuned toes \u2014 there are six of them,
p299
aVand they use the principles that I just talked about collectively for the blueprint.
p300
aVSo this is not using any suction, any glue,
p301
aVand it will ultimately, when it's attached to the robot \u2014
p302
aVit's as biologically inspired as the animal \u2014
p303
aVhopefully be able to climb any kind of a surface.
p304
aVHere you see it, next, going up the side of a building at Stanford.
p305
aVIt's sped up \u2014 again, it's a foot climbing.
p306
aVIt's not the whole robot yet, we're working on it \u2014
p307
aVnow you can see how it's attaching.
p308
aVThese tuned structures allow the spines, friction pads and ultimately the adhesive hairs
p309
aVto grab onto very challenging, difficult surfaces.
p310
aVAnd so they were able to get this thing \u2014 this is now sped up 20 times \u2014
p311
aVcan you imagine it trying to go up and rescue somebody at that upper floor? OK?
p312
aVYou can visualize this now; it's not impossible.
p313
aVIt's a very challenging task. But more to come later.
p314
aa(lp315
VTo finish: we've gotten design secrets from nature by looking at how feet are built.
p316
aVWe've learned we should distribute control to smart parts.
p317
aVDon't put it all in the brain,
p318
aVbut put some of the control in tuned feet, legs and even body.
p319
aVThat nature uses hybrid solutions, not a single solution, to these problems,
p320
aVand they're integrated and beautifully robust.
p321
aVAnd third, we believe strongly that we do not want to mimic nature but instead be inspired by biology,
p322
aVand use these novel principles with the best engineering solutions that are out there
p323
aVto make \u2014 potentially \u2014 something better than nature.
p324
aa(lp325
VSo there's a clear message:
p326
aVwhether you care about a fundamental, basic research
p327
aVof really interesting, bizarre, wonderful animals,
p328
aVor you want to build a search-and-rescue robot
p329
aVthat can help you in an earthquake, or to save someone in a fire,
p330
aVor you care about medicine, we must preserve nature's designs.
p331
aVOtherwise these secrets will be lost forever.
