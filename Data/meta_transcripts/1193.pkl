VEmbracing otherness.
p4
aVWhen I first heard this theme,
p5
aVI thought, well, embracing otherness
p6
aVis embracing myself.
p7
aVAnd the journey to that place
p8
aVof understanding and acceptance
p9
aVhas been an interesting one for me,
p10
aVand it's given me an insight
p11
aVinto the whole notion of self,
p12
aVwhich I think is worth sharing with you today.
p13
aa(lp14
VWe each have a self,
p15
aVbut I don't think that we're born with one.
p16
aVYou know how newborn babies
p17
aVbelieve they're part of everything;
p18
aVthey're not separate?
p19
aVWell that fundamental sense of oneness
p20
aVis lost on us very quickly.
p21
aVIt's like that initial stage is over \u2014
p22
aVoneness: infancy,
p23
aVunformed, primitive.
p24
aVIt's no longer valid or real.
p25
aVWhat is real is separateness,
p26
aVand at some point in early babyhood,
p27
aVthe idea of self
p28
aVstarts to form.
p29
aVOur little portion of oneness is given a name,
p30
aVis told all kinds of things about itself,
p31
aVand these details,
p32
aVopinions and ideas
p33
aVbecome facts,
p34
aVwhich go towards building ourselves,
p35
aVour identity.
p36
aVAnd that self becomes the vehicle
p37
aVfor navigating our social world.
p38
aVBut the self is a projection
p39
aVbased on other people's projections.
p40
aVIs it who we really are?
p41
aVOr who we really want to be, or should be?
p42
aa(lp43
VSo this whole interaction
p44
aVwith self and identity
p45
aVwas a very difficult one for me growing up.
p46
aVThe self that I attempted to take out into the world
p47
aVwas rejected over and over again.
p48
aVAnd my panic
p49
aVat not having a self that fit,
p50
aVand the confusion that came
p51
aVfrom my self being rejected,
p52
aVcreated anxiety, shame
p53
aVand hopelessness,
p54
aVwhich kind of defined me for a long time.
p55
aVBut in retrospect,
p56
aVthe destruction of my self was so repetitive
p57
aVthat I started to see a pattern.
p58
aVThe self changed,
p59
aVgot affected, broken, destroyed,
p60
aVbut another one would evolve \u2014
p61
aVsometimes stronger,
p62
aVsometimes hateful,
p63
aVsometimes not wanting to be there at all.
p64
aVThe self was not constant.
p65
aVAnd how many times
p66
aVwould my self have to die
p67
aVbefore I realized
p68
aVthat it was never alive in the first place?
p69
aa(lp70
VI grew up on the coast of England
p71
aVin the '70s.
p72
aVMy dad is white from Cornwall,
p73
aVand my mom is black from Zimbabwe.
p74
aVEven the idea of us as a family
p75
aVwas challenging to most people.
p76
aVBut nature had its wicked way,
p77
aVand brown babies were born.
p78
aVBut from about the age of five,
p79
aVI was aware that I didn't fit.
p80
aVI was the black atheist kid
p81
aVin the all-white Catholic school run by nuns.
p82
aVI was an anomaly,
p83
aVand my self was rooting around for definition
p84
aVand trying to plug in.
p85
aVBecause the self likes to fit,
p86
aVto see itself replicated,
p87
aVto belong.
p88
aVThat confirms its existence
p89
aVand its importance.
p90
aVAnd it is important.
p91
aVIt has an extremely important function.
p92
aVWithout it, we literally can't interface with others.
p93
aVWe can't hatch plans
p94
aVand climb that stairway of popularity,
p95
aVof success.
p96
aVBut my skin color wasn't right.
p97
aVMy hair wasn't right.
p98
aVMy history wasn't right.
p99
aVMy self became defined
p100
aVby otherness,
p101
aVwhich meant that, in that social world,
p102
aVI didn't really exist.
p103
aVAnd I was "other" before being anything else \u2014
p104
aVeven before being a girl.
p105
aVI was a noticeable nobody.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnother world was opening up
p108
aVaround this time:
p109
aVperformance and dancing.
p110
aVThat nagging dread of self-hood
p111
aVdidn't exist when I was dancing.
p112
aVI'd literally lose myself.
p113
aVAnd I was a really good dancer.
p114
aVI would put
p115
aVall my emotional expression
p116
aVinto my dancing.
p117
aVI could be in the movement
p118
aVin a way that I wasn't able to be
p119
aVin my real life, in myself.
p120
aa(lp121
VAnd at 16,
p122
aVI stumbled across another opportunity,
p123
aVand I earned my first acting role in a film.
p124
aVI can hardly find the words
p125
aVto describe the peace I felt
p126
aVwhen I was acting.
p127
aVMy dysfunctional self
p128
aVcould actually plug in
p129
aVto another self, not my own,
p130
aVand it felt so good.
p131
aVIt was the first time that I existed
p132
aVinside a fully-functioning self \u2014
p133
aVone that I controlled,
p134
aVthat I steered,
p135
aVthat I gave life to.
p136
aVBut the shooting day would end,
p137
aVand I'd return
p138
aVto my gnarly, awkward self.
p139
aa(lp140
VBy 19,
p141
aVI was a fully-fledged movie actor,
p142
aVbut still searching for definition.
p143
aVI applied to read anthropology
p144
aVat university.
p145
aVDr. Phyllis Lee gave me my interview,
p146
aVand she asked me, "How would you define race?"
p147
aVWell, I thought I had the answer to that one,
p148
aVand I said, "Skin color."
p149
aV"So biology, genetics?" she said.
p150
aV"Because, Thandie, that's not accurate.
p151
aVBecause there's actually more genetic difference
p152
aVbetween a black Kenyan
p153
aVand a black Ugandan
p154
aVthan there is between a black Kenyan
p155
aVand, say, a white Norwegian.
p156
aVBecause we all stem from Africa.
p157
aVSo in Africa,
p158
aVthere's been more time
p159
aVto create genetic diversity."
p160
aVIn other words,
p161
aVrace has no basis
p162
aVin biological or scientific fact.
p163
aVOn the one hand, result.
p164
aVRight?
p165
aVOn the other hand, my definition of self
p166
aVjust lost a huge chunk of its credibility.
p167
aVBut what was credible,
p168
aVwhat is biological and scientific fact,
p169
aVis that we all stem from Africa \u2014
p170
aVin fact, from a woman called Mitochondrial Eve
p171
aVwho lived 160,000 years ago.
p172
aVAnd race is an illegitimate concept
p173
aVwhich our selves have created
p174
aVbased on fear and ignorance.
p175
aa(lp176
VStrangely, these revelations
p177
aVdidn't cure my low self-esteem,
p178
aVthat feeling of otherness.
p179
aVMy desire to disappear
p180
aVwas still very powerful.
p181
aVI had a degree from Cambridge;
p182
aVI had a thriving career,
p183
aVbut my self was a car crash,
p184
aVand I wound up with bulimia
p185
aVand on a therapist's couch.
p186
aVAnd of course I did.
p187
aVI still believed
p188
aVmy self was all I was.
p189
aVI still valued self-worth
p190
aVabove all other worth,
p191
aVand what was there to suggest otherwise?
p192
aVWe've created entire value systems
p193
aVand a physical reality
p194
aVto support the worth of self.
p195
aVLook at the industry for self-image
p196
aVand the jobs it creates,
p197
aVthe revenue it turns over.
p198
aVWe'd be right in assuming
p199
aVthat the self is an actual living thing.
p200
aVBut it's not. It's a projection
p201
aVwhich our clever brains create
p202
aVin order to cheat ourselves
p203
aVfrom the reality of death.
p204
aa(lp205
VBut there is something
p206
aVthat can give the self
p207
aVultimate and infinite connection \u2014
p208
aVand that thing is oneness,
p209
aVour essence.
p210
aVThe self's struggle
p211
aVfor authenticity and definition
p212
aVwill never end
p213
aVunless it's connected to its creator \u2014
p214
aVto you and to me.
p215
aVAnd that can happen with awareness \u2014
p216
aVawareness of the reality of oneness
p217
aVand the projection of self-hood.
p218
aVFor a start, we can think about
p219
aVall the times when we do lose ourselves.
p220
aVIt happens when I dance,
p221
aVwhen I'm acting.
p222
aVI'm earthed in my essence,
p223
aVand my self is suspended.
p224
aVIn those moments,
p225
aVI'm connected to everything \u2014
p226
aVthe ground, the air,
p227
aVthe sounds, the energy from the audience.
p228
aVAll my senses are alert and alive
p229
aVin much the same way as an infant might feel \u2014
p230
aVthat feeling of oneness.
p231
aa(lp232
VAnd when I'm acting a role,
p233
aVI inhabit another self,
p234
aVand I give it life for awhile,
p235
aVbecause when the self is suspended
p236
aVso is divisiveness
p237
aVand judgment.
p238
aVAnd I've played everything
p239
aVfrom a vengeful ghost in the time of slavery
p240
aVto Secretary of State in 2004.
p241
aVAnd no matter how other
p242
aVthese selves might be,
p243
aVthey're all related in me.
p244
aVAnd I honestly believe
p245
aVthe key to my success as an actor
p246
aVand my progress as a person
p247
aVhas been the very lack of self
p248
aVthat used to make me feel
p249
aVso anxious and insecure.
p250
aVI always wondered
p251
aVwhy I could feel others' pain so deeply,
p252
aVwhy I could recognize
p253
aVthe somebody in the nobody.
p254
aVIt's because I didn't have a self to get in the way.
p255
aVI thought I lacked substance,
p256
aVand the fact that I could feel others'
p257
aVmeant that I had nothing of myself to feel.
p258
aVThe thing that was a source of shame
p259
aVwas actually a source of enlightenment.
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd when I realized
p262
aVand really understood
p263
aVthat my self is a projection and that it has a function,
p264
aVa funny thing happened.
p265
aVI stopped giving it so much authority.
p266
aVI give it its due.
p267
aVI take it to therapy.
p268
aVI've become very familiar
p269
aVwith its dysfunctional behavior.
p270
aVBut I'm not ashamed of my self.
p271
aVIn fact, I respect my self
p272
aVand its function.
p273
aVAnd over time and with practice,
p274
aVI've tried to live
p275
aVmore and more from my essence.
p276
aVAnd if you can do that,
p277
aVincredible things happen.
p278
aa(lp279
VI was in Congo in February,
p280
aVdancing and celebrating
p281
aVwith women who've survived
p282
aVthe destruction of their selves
p283
aVin literally unthinkable ways \u2014
p284
aVdestroyed because other brutalized, psychopathic selves
p285
aVall over that beautiful land
p286
aVare fueling our selves' addiction
p287
aVto iPods, Pads, and bling,
p288
aVwhich further disconnect ourselves
p289
aVfrom ever feeling their pain,
p290
aVtheir suffering,
p291
aVtheir death.
p292
aVBecause, hey,
p293
aVif we're all living in ourselves
p294
aVand mistaking it for life,
p295
aVthen we're devaluing
p296
aVand desensitizing life.
p297
aVAnd in that disconnected state,
p298
aVyeah, we can build factory farms with no windows,
p299
aVdestroy marine life
p300
aVand use rape as a weapon of war.
p301
aVSo here's a note to self:
p302
aVThe cracks have started to show
p303
aVin our constructed world,
p304
aVand oceans will continue
p305
aVto surge through the cracks,
p306
aVand oil and blood,
p307
aVrivers of it.
p308
aa(lp309
VCrucially, we haven't been figuring out
p310
aVhow to live in oneness
p311
aVwith the Earth and every other living thing.
p312
aVWe've just been insanely trying to figure out
p313
aVhow to live with each other \u2014 billions of each other.
p314
aVOnly we're not living with each other;
p315
aVour crazy selves are living with each other
p316
aVand perpetuating an epidemic
p317
aVof disconnection.
p318
aa(lp319
VLet's live with each other
p320
aVand take it a breath at a time.
p321
aVIf we can get under that heavy self,
p322
aVlight a torch of awareness,
p323
aVand find our essence,
p324
aVour connection to the infinite
p325
aVand every other living thing.
p326
aVWe knew it from the day we were born.
p327
aVLet's not be freaked out
p328
aVby our bountiful nothingness.
p329
aVIt's more a reality
p330
aVthan the ones our selves have created.
p331
aVImagine what kind of existence we can have
p332
aVif we honor inevitable death of self,
p333
aVappreciate the privilege of life
p334
aVand marvel at what comes next.
p335
aVSimple awareness is where it begins.
