VFor a long time in my life,
p4
aVI felt like I'd been living two different lives.
p5
aVThere's the life that everyone sees,
p6
aVand then there's the life that only I see.
p7
aVAnd in the life that everyone sees,
p8
aVwho I am is a friend,
p9
aVa son, a brother,
p10
aVa stand-up comedian and a teenager.
p11
aVThat's the life everyone sees.
p12
aVIf you were to ask my friends and family to describe me,
p13
aVthat's what they would tell you.
p14
aVAnd that's a huge part of me. That is who I am.
p15
aVAnd if you were to ask me to describe myself,
p16
aVI'd probably say some of those same things.
p17
aVAnd I wouldn't be lying,
p18
aVbut I wouldn't totally be telling you the truth, either,
p19
aVbecause the truth is,
p20
aVthat's just the life everyone else sees.
p21
aVIn the life that only I see, who I am,
p22
aVwho I really am,
p23
aVis someone who struggles intensely with depression.
p24
aVI have for the last six years of my life,
p25
aVand I continue to every day.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow, for someone who has never experienced depression
p28
aVor doesn't really know what that means,
p29
aVthat might surprise them to hear,
p30
aVbecause there's this pretty popular misconception
p31
aVthat depression is just being sad
p32
aVwhen something in your life goes wrong,
p33
aVwhen you break up with your girlfriend,
p34
aVwhen you lose a loved one,
p35
aVwhen you don't get the job you wanted.
p36
aVBut that's sadness. That's a natural thing.
p37
aVThat's a natural human emotion.
p38
aVReal depression isn't being sad
p39
aVwhen something in your life goes wrong.
p40
aVReal depression is being sad
p41
aVwhen everything in your life is going right.
p42
aVThat's real depression, and that's what I suffer from.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd to be totally honest,
p45
aVthat's hard for me to stand up here and say.
p46
aVIt's hard for me to talk about,
p47
aVand it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about,
p48
aVso much so that no one's talking about it.
p49
aVAnd no one's talking about depression, but we need to be,
p50
aVbecause right now it's a massive problem.
p51
aVIt's a massive problem.
p52
aVBut we don't see it on social media, right?
p53
aVWe don't see it on Facebook. We don't see it on Twitter.
p54
aVWe don't see it on the news, because it's not happy,
p55
aVit's not fun, it's not light.
p56
aVAnd so because we don't see it, we don't see the severity of it.
p57
aa(lp58
VBut the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this:
p59
aVevery 30 seconds,
p60
aVevery 30 seconds, somewhere,
p61
aVsomeone in the world takes their own life
p62
aVbecause of depression,
p63
aVand it might be two blocks away, it might be two countries away,
p64
aVit might be two continents away, but it's happening,
p65
aVand it's happening every single day.
p66
aVAnd we have a tendency, as a society,
p67
aVto look at that and go, "So what?"
p68
aVSo what? We look at that, and we go, "That's your problem.
p69
aVThat's their problem."
p70
aVWe say we're sad and we say we're sorry,
p71
aVbut we also say, "So what?"
p72
aa(lp73
VWell, two years ago it was my problem,
p74
aVbecause I sat on the edge of my bed
p75
aVwhere I'd sat a million times before
p76
aVand I was suicidal.
p77
aVI was suicidal, and if you were to look at my life on the surface,
p78
aVyou wouldn't see a kid who was suicidal.
p79
aVYou'd see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team,
p80
aVthe drama and theater student of the year,
p81
aVthe English student of the year,
p82
aVsomeone who was consistently on the honor roll
p83
aVand consistently at every party.
p84
aVSo you would say I wasn't depressed, you would say
p85
aVI wasn't suicidal, but you would be wrong.
p86
aVYou would be wrong. So I sat there that night
p87
aVbeside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand
p88
aVand I thought about taking my own life
p89
aVand I came this close to doing it.
p90
aVI came this close to doing it.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd I didn't, so that makes me one of the lucky ones,
p93
aVone of the people who gets to step out on the ledge
p94
aVand look down but not jump,
p95
aVone of the lucky ones who survives.
p96
aVWell, I survived, and that just leaves me with my story,
p97
aVand my story is this:
p98
aVIn four simple words, I suffer from depression.
p99
aVI suffer from depression,
p100
aVand for a long time, I think,
p101
aVI was living two totally different lives,
p102
aVwhere one person was always afraid of the other.
p103
aVI was afraid that people would see me for who I really was,
p104
aVthat I wasn't the perfect, popular kid in high school everyone thought I was,
p105
aVthat beneath my smile, there was struggle,
p106
aVand beneath my light, there was dark,
p107
aVand beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain.
p108
aa(lp109
VSee, some people might fear girls not liking them back.
p110
aVSome people might fear sharks. Some people might fear death.
p111
aVBut for me, for a large part of my life, I feared myself.
p112
aVI feared my truth, I feared my honesty, I feared my vulnerability,
p113
aVand that fear made me feel
p114
aVlike I was forced into a corner,
p115
aVlike I was forced into a corner and there was only one way out,
p116
aVand so I thought about that way every single day.
p117
aVI thought about it every single day,
p118
aVand if I'm being totally honest, standing here
p119
aVI've thought about it again since, because that's the sickness,
p120
aVthat's the struggle, that's depression,
p121
aVand depression isn't chicken pox.
p122
aVYou don't beat it once and it's gone forever.
p123
aVIt's something you live with. It's something you live in.
p124
aVIt's the roommate you can't kick out. It's the voice you can't ignore.
p125
aVIt's the feelings you can't seem to escape,
p126
aVthe scariest part is that after a while,
p127
aVyou become numb to it. It becomes normal for you,
p128
aVand what you really fear the most
p129
aVisn't the suffering inside of you.
p130
aVIt's the stigma inside of others,
p131
aVit's the shame, it's the embarrassment,
p132
aVit's the disapproving look on a friend's face,
p133
aVit's the whispers in the hallway that you're weak,
p134
aVit's the comments that you're crazy.
p135
aVThat's what keeps you from getting help.
p136
aVThat's what makes you hold it in and hide it.
p137
aVIt's the stigma. So you hold it in and you hide it,
p138
aVand you hold it in and you hide it,
p139
aVand even though it's keeping you in bed every day
p140
aVand it's making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it,
p141
aVyou hide it, because the stigma in our society
p142
aVaround depression is very real.
p143
aVIt's very real, and if you think that it isn't, ask yourself this:
p144
aVWould you rather make your next Facebook status
p145
aVsay you're having a tough time getting out of bed
p146
aVbecause you hurt your back
p147
aVor you're having a tough time getting out of bed every morning
p148
aVbecause you're depressed?
p149
aVThat's the stigma, because unfortunately,
p150
aVwe live in a world where if you break your arm,
p151
aVeveryone runs over to sign your cast,
p152
aVbut if you tell people you're depressed, everyone runs the other way.
p153
aVThat's the stigma.
p154
aVWe are so, so, so accepting of any body part breaking down
p155
aVother than our brains. And that's ignorance.
p156
aVThat's pure ignorance, and that ignorance has created
p157
aVa world that doesn't understand depression,
p158
aVthat doesn't understand mental health.
p159
aVAnd that's ironic to me, because depression
p160
aVis one of the best documented problems we have in the world,
p161
aVyet it's one of the least discussed.
p162
aVWe just push it aside and put it in a corner
p163
aVand pretend it's not there and hope it'll fix itself.
p164
aa(lp165
VWell, it won't. It hasn't, and it's not going to,
p166
aVbecause that's wishful thinking,
p167
aVand wishful thinking isn't a game plan, it's procrastination,
p168
aVand we can't procrastinate on something this important.
p169
aVThe first step in solving any problem
p170
aVis recognizing there is one.
p171
aVWell, we haven't done that, so we can't really expect
p172
aVto find an answer when we're still afraid of the question.
p173
aa(lp174
VAnd I don't know what the solution is.
p175
aVI wish I did, but I don't \u2014 but I think,
p176
aVI think it has to start here.
p177
aVIt has to start with me, it has to start with you,
p178
aVit has to start with the people who are suffering,
p179
aVthe ones who are hidden in the shadows.
p180
aVWe need to speak up and shatter the silence.
p181
aVWe need to be the ones who are brave for what we believe in,
p182
aVbecause if there's one thing that I've come to realize,
p183
aVif there's one thing that I see as the biggest problem,
p184
aVit's not in building a world
p185
aVwhere we eliminate the ignorance of others.
p186
aVIt's in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves,
p187
aVwhere we're okay with who we are,
p188
aVbecause when we get honest,
p189
aVwe see that we all struggle and we all suffer.
p190
aVWhether it's with this, whether it's with something else,
p191
aVwe all know what it is to hurt.
p192
aVWe all know what it is to have pain in our heart,
p193
aVand we all know how important it is to heal.
p194
aVBut right now, depression is society's deep cut
p195
aVthat we're content to put a Band-Aid over and pretend it's not there.
p196
aa(lp197
VWell, it is there. It is there, and you know what? It's okay.
p198
aVDepression is okay. If you're going through it, know that you're okay.
p199
aVAnd know that you're sick, you're not weak,
p200
aVand it's an issue, not an identity,
p201
aVbecause when you get past the fear and the ridicule
p202
aVand the judgment and the stigma of others,
p203
aVyou can see depression for what it really is,
p204
aVand that's just a part of life,
p205
aVjust a part of life, and as much as I hate,
p206
aVas much as I hate some of the places,
p207
aVsome of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to,
p208
aVin a lot of ways I'm grateful for it.
p209
aVBecause yeah, it's put me in the valleys,
p210
aVbut only to show me there's peaks,
p211
aVand yeah it's dragged me through the dark
p212
aVbut only to remind me there is light.
p213
aVMy pain, more than anything in 19 years on this planet,
p214
aVhas given me perspective, and my hurt,
p215
aVmy hurt has forced me to have hope,
p216
aVhave hope and to have faith, faith in myself,
p217
aVfaith in others, faith that it can get better,
p218
aVthat we can change this, that we can speak up
p219
aVand speak out and fight back against ignorance,
p220
aVfight back against intolerance,
p221
aVand more than anything,
p222
aVlearn to love ourselves,
p223
aVlearn to accept ourselves for who we are,
p224
aVthe people we are, not the people the world wants us to be.
p225
aVBecause the world I believe in is one
p226
aVwhere embracing your light doesn't mean ignoring your dark.
p227
aVThe world I believe in is one where we're measured
p228
aVby our ability to overcome adversities, not avoid them.
p229
aVThe world I believe in is one where I can look someone in the eye
p230
aVand say, "I'm going through hell,"
p231
aVand they can look back at me and go, "Me too," and that's okay,
p232
aVand it's okay because depression is okay. We're people.
p233
aVWe're people, and we struggle and we suffer
p234
aVand we bleed and we cry, and if you think that true strength
p235
aVmeans never showing any weakness, then I'm here
p236
aVto tell you you're wrong.
p237
aVYou're wrong, because it's the opposite.
p238
aVWe're people, and we have problems.
p239
aVWe're not perfect, and that's okay.
p240
aa(lp241
VSo we need to stop the ignorance,
p242
aVstop the intolerance, stop the stigma,
p243
aVand stop the silence, and we need to take away the taboos,
p244
aVtake a look at the truth, and start talking,
p245
aVbecause the only way we're going to beat a problem
p246
aVthat people are battling alone
p247
aVis by standing strong together,
p248
aVby standing strong together.
p249
aa(lp250
VAnd I believe that we can.
p251
aVI believe that we can. Thank you guys so much.
p252
aVThis is a dream come true. Thank you. (Applause)
p253
aVThank you. (Applause)
