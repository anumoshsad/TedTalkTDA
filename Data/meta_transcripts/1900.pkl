VThree and a half years ago,
p4
aVI made one of the best decisions of my life.
p5
aVAs my New Year's resolution,
p6
aVI gave up dieting, stopped worrying about my weight,
p7
aVand learned to eat mindfully.
p8
aVNow I eat whenever I'm hungry,
p9
aVand I've lost 10 pounds.
p10
aa(lp11
VThis was me at age 13,
p12
aVwhen I started my first diet.
p13
aVI look at that picture now, and I think,
p14
aVyou did not need a diet,
p15
aVyou needed a fashion consult.
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aVBut I thought I needed to lose weight,
p18
aVand when I gained it back,
p19
aVof course I blamed myself.
p20
aVAnd for the next three decades,
p21
aVI was on and off various diets.
p22
aVNo matter what I tried,
p23
aVthe weight I'd lost always came back.
p24
aVI'm sure many of you know the feeling.
p25
aa(lp26
VAs a neuroscientist,
p27
aVI wondered, why is this so hard?
p28
aVObviously, how much you weigh depends on
p29
aVhow much you eat and how much energy you burn.
p30
aVWhat most people don't realize
p31
aVis that hunger and energy use
p32
aVare controlled by the brain,
p33
aVmostly without your awareness.
p34
aVYour brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes,
p35
aVand that is a good thing,
p36
aVbecause your conscious mind \u2014
p37
aVhow do we put this politely? \u2014
p38
aVit's easily distracted.
p39
aVIt's good that you don't have to remember to breathe
p40
aVwhen you get caught up in a movie.
p41
aVYou don't forget how to walk
p42
aVbecause you're thinking about what to have for dinner.
p43
aa(lp44
VYour brain also has its own sense
p45
aVof what you should weigh,
p46
aVno matter what you consciously believe.
p47
aVThis is called your set point,
p48
aVbut that's a misleading term,
p49
aVbecause it's actually a range
p50
aVof about 10 or 15 pounds.
p51
aVYou can use lifestyle choices to move your weight
p52
aVup and down within that range,
p53
aVbut it's much, much harder to stay outside of it.
p54
aVThe hypothalamus, the part of the brain
p55
aVthat regulates body weight,
p56
aVthere are more than a dozen chemical signals
p57
aVin the brain that tell your body to gain weight,
p58
aVmore than another dozen that tell your body to lose it,
p59
aVand the system works like a thermostat,
p60
aVresponding to signals from the body
p61
aVby adjusting hunger, activity and metabolism,
p62
aVto keep your weight stable as conditions change.
p63
aVThat's what a thermostat does, right?
p64
aVIt keeps the temperature in your house the same
p65
aVas the weather changes outside.
p66
aVNow you can try to change the temperature
p67
aVin your house by opening a window in the winter,
p68
aVbut that's not going to change the setting on the thermostat,
p69
aVwhich will respond by kicking on the furnace
p70
aVto warm the place back up.
p71
aVYour brain works exactly the same way,
p72
aVresponding to weight loss by using powerful tools
p73
aVto push your body back
p74
aVto what it considers normal.
p75
aVIf you lose a lot of weight,
p76
aVyour brain reacts as if you were starving,
p77
aVand whether you started out fat or thin,
p78
aVyour brain's response is exactly the same.
p79
aVWe would love to think that your brain could tell
p80
aVwhether you need to lose weight or not,
p81
aVbut it can't.
p82
aVIf you do lose a lot of weight,
p83
aVyou become hungry,
p84
aVand your muscles burn less energy.
p85
aVDr. Rudy Leibel of Columbia University
p86
aVhas found that people who have lost
p87
aV10 percent of their body weight
p88
aVburn 250 to 400 calories less
p89
aVbecause their metabolism is suppressed.
p90
aVThat's a lot of food.
p91
aVThis means that a successful dieter
p92
aVmust eat this much less forever
p93
aVthan someone of the same weight
p94
aVwho has always been thin.
p95
aa(lp96
VFrom an evolutionary perspective,
p97
aVyour body's resistance to weight loss makes sense.
p98
aVWhen food was scarce, our ancestors' survival
p99
aVdepended on conserving energy,
p100
aVand regaining the weight when food was available
p101
aVwould have protected them against the next shortage.
p102
aVOver the course of human history,
p103
aVstarvation has been a much bigger problem
p104
aVthan overeating.
p105
aVThis may explain a very sad fact:
p106
aVSet points can go up,
p107
aVbut they rarely go down.
p108
aVNow, if your mother ever mentioned
p109
aVthat life is not fair,
p110
aVthis is the kind of thing she was talking about.
p111
aV(Laughter)
p112
aVSuccessful dieting doesn't lower your set point.
p113
aVEven after you've kept the weight off
p114
aVfor as long as seven years,
p115
aVyour brain keeps trying to make you gain it back.
p116
aVIf that weight loss had been due to a long famine,
p117
aVthat would be a sensible response.
p118
aVIn our modern world of drive-thru burgers,
p119
aVit's not working out so well for many of us.
p120
aVThat difference between our ancestral past
p121
aVand our abundant present
p122
aVis the reason that Dr. Yoni Freedhoff
p123
aVof the University of Ottawa
p124
aVwould like to take some of his patients back to a time
p125
aVwhen food was less available,
p126
aVand it's also the reason
p127
aVthat changing the food environment
p128
aVis really going to be the most effective solution
p129
aVto obesity.
p130
aa(lp131
VSadly, a temporary weight gain
p132
aVcan become permanent.
p133
aVIf you stay at a high weight for too long,
p134
aVprobably a matter of years for most of us,
p135
aVyour brain may decide that that's the new normal.
p136
aa(lp137
VPsychologists classify eaters into two groups,
p138
aVthose who rely on their hunger
p139
aVand those who try to control their eating
p140
aVthrough willpower, like most dieters.
p141
aVLet's call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters.
p142
aVThe interesting thing is that intuitive eaters
p143
aVare less likely to be overweight,
p144
aVand they spend less time thinking about food.
p145
aVControlled eaters are more vulnerable
p146
aVto overeating in response to advertising,
p147
aVsuper-sizing, and the all-you-can-eat buffet.
p148
aVAnd a small indulgence,
p149
aVlike eating one scoop of ice cream,
p150
aVis more likely to lead to a food binge
p151
aVin controlled eaters.
p152
aVChildren are especially vulnerable
p153
aVto this cycle of dieting and then binging.
p154
aVSeveral long-term studies have shown
p155
aVthat girls who diet in their early teenage years
p156
aVare three times more likely to become overweight
p157
aVfive years later,
p158
aVeven if they started at a normal weight,
p159
aVand all of these studies found
p160
aVthat the same factors
p161
aVthat predicted weight gain
p162
aValso predicted the development of eating disorders.
p163
aVThe other factor, by the way,
p164
aVthose of you who are parents,
p165
aVwas being teased by family members
p166
aVabout their weight.
p167
aVSo don't do that.
p168
aV(Laughter)
p169
aa(lp170
VI left almost all my graphs at home,
p171
aVbut I couldn't resist throwing in just this one,
p172
aVbecause I'm a geek, and that's how I roll.
p173
aV(Laughter)
p174
aVThis is a study that looked at the risk of death
p175
aVover a 14-year period
p176
aVbased on four healthy habits:
p177
aVeating enough fruits and vegetables,
p178
aVexercise three times a week,
p179
aVnot smoking,
p180
aVand drinking in moderation.
p181
aVLet's start by looking at the normal weight
p182
aVpeople in the study.
p183
aVThe height of the bars is the risk of death,
p184
aVand those zero, one, two, three, four numbers
p185
aVon the horizontal axis
p186
aVare the number of those healthy habits
p187
aVthat a given person had.
p188
aVAnd as you'd expect, the healthier the lifestyle,
p189
aVthe less likely people were to die during the study.
p190
aVNow let's look at what happens
p191
aVin overweight people.
p192
aVThe ones that had no healthy habits
p193
aVhad a higher risk of death.
p194
aVAdding just one healthy habit
p195
aVpulls overweight people back into the normal range.
p196
aVFor obese people with no healthy habits,
p197
aVthe risk is very high, seven times higher
p198
aVthan the healthiest groups in the study.
p199
aVBut a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too.
p200
aVIn fact, if you look only at the group
p201
aVwith all four healthy habits,
p202
aVyou can see that weight makes very little difference.
p203
aVYou can take control of your health
p204
aVby taking control of your lifestyle,
p205
aVeven If you can't lose weight
p206
aVand keep it off.
p207
aa(lp208
VDiets don't have very much reliability.
p209
aVFive years after a diet,
p210
aVmost people have regained the weight.
p211
aVForty percent of them have gained even more.
p212
aVIf you think about this,
p213
aVthe typical outcome of dieting
p214
aVis that you're more likely to gain weight
p215
aVin the long run than to lose it.
p216
aa(lp217
VIf I've convinced you that dieting
p218
aVmight be a problem,
p219
aVthe next question is, what do you do about it?
p220
aVAnd my answer, in a word, is mindfulness.
p221
aVI'm not saying you need to learn to meditate
p222
aVor take up yoga.
p223
aVI'm talking about mindful eating:
p224
aVlearning to understand your body's signals
p225
aVso that you eat when you're hungry
p226
aVand stop when you're full,
p227
aVbecause a lot of weight gain boils down
p228
aVto eating when you're not hungry.
p229
aVHow do you do it?
p230
aVGive yourself permission to eat
p231
aVas much as you want, and then work on figuring out
p232
aVwhat makes your body feel good.
p233
aVSit down to regular meals without distractions.
p234
aVThink about how your body feels
p235
aVwhen you start to eat and when you stop,
p236
aVand let your hunger decide
p237
aVwhen you should be done.
p238
aVIt took about a year for me to learn this,
p239
aVbut it's really been worth it.
p240
aVI am so much more relaxed around food
p241
aVthan I have ever been in my life.
p242
aVI often don't think about it.
p243
aVI forget we have chocolate in the house.
p244
aVIt's like aliens have taken over my brain.
p245
aVIt's just completely different.
p246
aVI should say that
p247
aVthis approach to eating probably won't make you lose weight
p248
aVunless you often eat when you're not hungry,
p249
aVbut doctors don't know of any approach
p250
aVthat makes significant weight loss in a lot of people,
p251
aVand that is why a lot of people are now focusing on
p252
aVpreventing weight gain
p253
aVinstead of promoting weight loss.
p254
aVLet's face it:
p255
aVIf diets worked, we'd all be thin already.
p256
aV(Laughter)
p257
aVWhy do we keep doing the same thing
p258
aVand expecting different results?
p259
aVDiets may seem harmless,
p260
aVbut they actually do a lot of collateral damage.
p261
aVAt worst, they ruin lives:
p262
aVWeight obsession leads to eating disorders,
p263
aVespecially in young kids.
p264
aVIn the U.S., we have 80 percent of 10-year-old girls
p265
aVsay they've been on a diet.
p266
aVOur daughters have learned to measure their worth
p267
aVby the wrong scale.
p268
aVEven at its best,
p269
aVdieting is a waste of time and energy.
p270
aVIt takes willpower which you could be using
p271
aVto help your kids with their homework
p272
aVor to finish that important work project,
p273
aVand because willpower is limited,
p274
aVany strategy that relies on its consistent application
p275
aVis pretty much guaranteed
p276
aVto eventually fail you
p277
aVwhen your attention moves on to something else.
p278
aa(lp279
VLet me leave you with one last thought.
p280
aVWhat if we told all those dieting girls
p281
aVthat it's okay to eat when they're hungry?
p282
aVWhat if we taught them to work with their appetite
p283
aVinstead of fearing it?
p284
aVI think most of them would be happier and healthier,
p285
aVand as adults,
p286
aVmany of them would probably be thinner.
p287
aVI wish someone had told me that
p288
aVback when I was 13.
p289
aa(lp290
VThanks.
