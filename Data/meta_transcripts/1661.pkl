VOrganic chemists make molecules,
p4
aVvery complicated molecules,
p5
aVby chopping up a big molecule into small molecules
p6
aVand reverse engineering.
p7
aVAnd as a chemist,
p8
aVone of the things I wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is,
p9
aVcould we make a really cool universal chemistry set?
p10
aVIn essence, could we "app" chemistry?
p11
aa(lp12
VNow what would this mean, and how would we do it?
p13
aVWell to start to do this,
p14
aVwe took a 3D printer
p15
aVand we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side
p16
aVand then print the molecule at the same time on the other side
p17
aVand combine them together in what we call reactionware.
p18
aVAnd so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time,
p19
aVwe may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry.
p20
aa(lp21
VNow what could this mean?
p22
aVWell if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine,
p23
aVso if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure
p24
aVor bacteria that you want to kill,
p25
aVif you have this embedded in your device
p26
aVat the same time, and you do the chemistry,
p27
aVyou may be able to make drugs in a new way.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo how are we doing this in the lab?
p30
aVWell it requires software, it requires hardware
p31
aVand it requires chemical inks.
p32
aVAnd so the really cool bit is,
p33
aVthe idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks
p34
aVthat we put out with the printer,
p35
aVand you download the blueprint, the organic chemistry for that molecule
p36
aVand you make it in the device.
p37
aVAnd so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo what could this mean?
p40
aVWell, ultimately, it could mean that you could print your own medicine.
p41
aVAnd this is what we're doing in the lab at the moment.
p42
aa(lp43
VBut to take baby steps to get there,
p44
aVfirst of all we want to look at drug design and production,
p45
aVor drug discovery and manufacturing.
p46
aVBecause if we can manufacture it after we've discovered it,
p47
aVwe could deploy it anywhere.
p48
aVYou don't need to go to the chemist anymore.
p49
aVWe can print drugs at point of need.
p50
aVWe can download new diagnostics.
p51
aVSay a new super bug has emerged.
p52
aVYou put it in your search engine,
p53
aVand you create the drug to treat the threat.
p54
aVSo this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly.
p55
aa(lp56
VBut perhaps for me the core bit going into the future
p57
aVis this idea of taking your own stem cells,
p58
aVwith your genes and your environment,
p59
aVand you print your own personal medicine.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd if that doesn't seem fanciful enough,
p62
aVwhere do you think we're going to go?
p63
aVWell, you're going to have your own personal matter fabricator.
p64
aVBeam me up, Scotty.
