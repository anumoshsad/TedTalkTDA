VFive years ago, I was a Ph.D. student
p4
aVliving two lives.
p5
aVIn one, I used NASA supercomputers
p6
aVto design next-generation spacecraft,
p7
aVand in the other I was a data scientist
p8
aVlooking for potential smugglers
p9
aVof sensitive nuclear technologies.
p10
aVAs a data scientist, I did a lot of analyses,
p11
aVmostly of facilities,
p12
aVindustrial facilities around the world.
p13
aVAnd I was always looking for a better canvas
p14
aVto tie these all together.
p15
aVAnd one day, I was thinking about how
p16
aVall data has a location,
p17
aVand I realized that the answer
p18
aVhad been staring me in the face.
p19
aVAlthough I was a satellite engineer,
p20
aVI hadn't thought about using satellite imagery
p21
aVin my work.
p22
aa(lp23
VNow, like most of us, I'd been online,
p24
aVI'd see my house, so I thought,
p25
aVI'll hop in there and I'll start looking up
p26
aVsome of these facilities.
p27
aVAnd what I found really surprised me.
p28
aVThe pictures that I was finding
p29
aVwere years out of date,
p30
aVand because of that,
p31
aVit had relatively little relevance
p32
aVto the work that I was doing today.
p33
aVBut I was intrigued.
p34
aVI mean, satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff.
p35
aVThere are millions and millions of sensors
p36
aVsurrounding us today,
p37
aVbut there's still so much we don't know on a daily basis.
p38
aVHow much oil is stored in all of China?
p39
aVHow much corn is being produced?
p40
aVHow many ships are in all of our world's ports?
p41
aVNow, in theory, all of these questions
p42
aVcould be answered by imagery,
p43
aVbut not if it's old.
p44
aVAnd if this data was so valuable,
p45
aVthen how come I couldn't get my hands
p46
aVon more recent pictures?
p47
aa(lp48
VSo the story begins over 50 years ago
p49
aVwith the launch of the first generation
p50
aVof U.S. government photo reconnaissance satellites.
p51
aVAnd today, there's a handful
p52
aVof the great, great grandchildren
p53
aVof these early Cold War machines
p54
aVwhich are now operated by private companies
p55
aVand from which the vast majority of satellite imagery
p56
aVthat you and I see on a daily basis comes.
p57
aVDuring this period, launching things into space,
p58
aVjust the rocket to get the satellite up there,
p59
aVhas cost hundreds of millions of dollars each,
p60
aVand that's created tremendous pressure
p61
aVto launch things infrequently
p62
aVand to make sure that when you do,
p63
aVyou cram as much functionality in there as possible.
p64
aVAll of this has only made satellites
p65
aVbigger and bigger and bigger
p66
aVand more expensive,
p67
aVnow nearly a billion, with a b, dollars per copy.
p68
aVBecause they are so expensive,
p69
aVthere aren't very many of them.
p70
aVBecause there aren't very many of them,
p71
aVthe pictures that we see on a daily basis
p72
aVtend to be old.
p73
aa(lp74
VI think a lot of people actually understand this anecdotally,
p75
aVbut in order to visualize just how sparsely
p76
aVour planet is collected,
p77
aVsome friends and I put together a dataset
p78
aVof the 30 million pictures that have been gathered
p79
aVby these satellites between 2000 and 2010.
p80
aVAs you can see in blue, huge areas of our world
p81
aVare barely seen, less than once a year,
p82
aVand even the areas that are seen most frequently,
p83
aVthose in red, are seen at best once a quarter.
p84
aVNow as aerospace engineering grad students,
p85
aVthis chart cried out to us as a challenge.
p86
aVWhy do these things have to be so expensive?
p87
aVDoes a single satellite really have to cost
p88
aVthe equivalent of three 747 jumbo jets?
p89
aVWasn't there a way to build a smaller,
p90
aVsimpler, new satellite design that could enable
p91
aVmore timely imaging?
p92
aa(lp93
VI realize that it does sound a little bit crazy
p94
aVthat we were going to go out and just
p95
aVbegin designing satellites,
p96
aVbut fortunately we had help.
p97
aVIn the late 1990s, a couple of professors
p98
aVproposed a concept for radically reducing the price
p99
aVof putting things in space.
p100
aVThis was hitchhiking small satellites
p101
aValongside much larger satellites.
p102
aVThis dropped the cost of putting objects up there
p103
aVby over a factor of 100,
p104
aVand suddenly we could afford to experiment,
p105
aVto take a little bit of risk,
p106
aVand to realize a lot of innovation.
p107
aVAnd a new generation of engineers and scientists,
p108
aVmostly out of universities,
p109
aVbegan launching these very small,
p110
aVbreadbox-sized satellites called CubeSats.
p111
aVAnd these were built with electronics obtained
p112
aVfrom RadioShack instead of Lockheed Martin.
p113
aa(lp114
VNow it was using the lessons learned from these early missions
p115
aVthat my friends and I began a series of sketches
p116
aVof our own satellite design.
p117
aVAnd I can't remember a specific day
p118
aVwhere we made a conscious decision
p119
aVthat we were actually going to go out and build these things,
p120
aVbut once we got that idea in our minds
p121
aVof the world as a dataset,
p122
aVof being able to capture millions of data points
p123
aVon a daily basis describing the global economy,
p124
aVof being able to unearth billions of connections
p125
aVbetween them that had never before been found,
p126
aVit just seemed boring
p127
aVto go work on anything else.
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd so we moved into a cramped,
p130
aVwindowless office in Palo Alto,
p131
aVand began working to take our design
p132
aVfrom the drawing board into the lab.
p133
aVThe first major question we had to tackle
p134
aVwas just how big to build this thing.
p135
aVIn space, size drives cost,
p136
aVand we had worked with these very small,
p137
aVbreadbox-sized satellites in school,
p138
aVbut as we began to better understand the laws of physics,
p139
aVwe found that the quality of pictures
p140
aVthose satellites could take was very limited,
p141
aVbecause the laws of physics dictate
p142
aVthat the best picture you can take through a telescope
p143
aVis a function of the diameter of that telescope,
p144
aVand these satellites had a very small,
p145
aVvery constrained volume.
p146
aVAnd we found that the best picture we would
p147
aVhave been able to get looked something like this.
p148
aVAlthough this was the low-cost option,
p149
aVquite frankly it was just too blurry
p150
aVto see the things that make satellite imagery valuable.
p151
aVSo about three or four weeks later,
p152
aVwe met a group of engineers randomly
p153
aVwho had worked on the first
p154
aVprivate imaging satellite ever developed,
p155
aVand they told us that back in the 1970s,
p156
aVthe U.S. government had found a powerful
p157
aVoptimal tradeoff \u2014
p158
aVthat in taking pictures at right about one meter resolution,
p159
aVbeing able to see objects one meter in size,
p160
aVthey had found that they could not just get very high-quality images,
p161
aVbut get a lot of them at an affordable price.
p162
aVFrom our own computer simulations,
p163
aVwe quickly found that one meter really was
p164
aVthe minimum viable product
p165
aVto be able to see the drivers of our global economy,
p166
aVfor the first time, being able to count
p167
aVthe ships and cars and shipping containers and trucks
p168
aVthat move around our world on a daily basis,
p169
aVwhile conveniently still not being able to see individuals.
p170
aVWe had found our compromise.
p171
aVWe would have to build something larger
p172
aVthan the original breadbox,
p173
aVnow more like a mini-fridge,
p174
aVbut we still wouldn't have to build a pickup truck.
p175
aVSo now we had our constraint.
p176
aVThe laws of physics dictated
p177
aVthe absolute minimum-sized telescope that we could build.
p178
aa(lp179
VWhat came next was making the rest of the satellite
p180
aVas small and as simple as possible,
p181
aVbasically a flying telescope with four walls
p182
aVand a set of electronics smaller than a phone book
p183
aVthat used less power than a 100 watt lightbulb.
p184
aVThe big challenge became actually taking
p185
aVthe pictures through that telescope.
p186
aVTraditional imaging satellites use a line scanner,
p187
aVsimilar to a Xerox machine,
p188
aVand as they traverse the Earth, they take pictures,
p189
aVscanning row by row by row
p190
aVto build the complete image.
p191
aVNow people use these because they get a lot of light,
p192
aVwhich means less of the noise you see
p193
aVin a low-cost cell phone image.
p194
aVThe problem with them is they require
p195
aVvery sophisticated pointing.
p196
aVYou have to stay focused on a 50-centimeter target
p197
aVfrom over 600 miles away
p198
aVwhile moving at more than seven kilometers a second,
p199
aVwhich requires an awesome degree of complexity.
p200
aVSo instead, we turned to a new generation of video sensors,
p201
aVoriginally created for use in night vision goggles.
p202
aVInstead of taking a single, high quality image,
p203
aVwe could take a videostream
p204
aVof individually noisier frames,
p205
aVbut then we could recombine
p206
aVall of those frames together
p207
aVinto very high-quality images
p208
aVusing sophisticated pixel processing techniques
p209
aVhere on the ground,
p210
aVat a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system.
p211
aVAnd we applied this technique
p212
aVto many of the other systems on the satellite as well,
p213
aVand day by day, our design evolved
p214
aVfrom CAD to prototypes
p215
aVto production units.
p216
aa(lp217
VA few short weeks ago,
p218
aVwe packed up SkySat 1,
p219
aVput our signatures on it,
p220
aVand waved goodbye for the last time on Earth.
p221
aVToday, it's sitting in its final launch configuration
p222
aVready to blast off in a few short weeks.
p223
aVAnd soon, we'll turn our attention to launching
p224
aVa constellation of 24 or more of these satellites
p225
aVand beginning to build the scalable analytics
p226
aVthat will allow us to unearth the insights
p227
aVin the petabytes of data we will collect.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo why do all of this? Why build these satellites?
p230
aVWell, it turns out imaging satellites
p231
aVhave a unique ability to provide global transparency,
p232
aVand providing that transparency on a timely basis
p233
aVis simply an idea whose time has come.
p234
aVWe see ourselves as pioneers of a new frontier,
p235
aVand beyond economic data,
p236
aVunlocking the human story, moment by moment.
p237
aVFor a data scientist
p238
aVthat just happened to go to space camp as a kid,
p239
aVit just doesn't get much better than that.
