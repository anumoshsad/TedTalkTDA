VHow many Creationists do we have in the room?
p4
aVProbably none. I think we're all Darwinians.
p5
aVAnd yet many Darwinians are anxious, a little uneasy \u2014
p6
aVwould like to see some limits on just how far the Darwinism goes.
p7
aVIt's all right.
p8
aVYou know spiderwebs? Sure, they are products of evolution.
p9
aVThe World Wide Web? Not so sure.
p10
aVBeaver dams, yes. Hoover Dam, no.
p11
aVWhat do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity
p12
aVfrom being themselves, fruits of the tree of life,
p13
aVand hence, in some sense, obeying evolutionary rules?
p14
aVAnd yet people are interestingly resistant
p15
aVto the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking \u2014 to our thinking.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd so I'm going to talk a little bit about that,
p18
aVkeeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here.
p19
aVSo you're out in the woods, or you're out in the pasture,
p20
aVand you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass.
p21
aVIt climbs up to the top, and it falls,
p22
aVand it climbs, and it falls, and it climbs \u2014
p23
aVtrying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass.
p24
aVWhat is this ant doing? What is this in aid of?
p25
aVWhat goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass?
p26
aVWhat's in it for the ant?
p27
aVAnd the answer is: nothing. There's nothing in it for the ant.
p28
aVWell then, why is it doing this?
p29
aVIs it just a fluke?
p30
aVYeah, it's just a fluke. It's a lancet fluke.
p31
aVIt's a little brain worm.
p32
aVIt's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow
p33
aVin order to continue its life cycle.
p34
aVSalmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds,
p35
aVand lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant,
p36
aVcrawl into its brain, and drive it up a blade of grass like an all-terrain vehicle.
p37
aVSo there's nothing in it for the ant.
p38
aVThe ant's brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain,
p39
aVinducing suicidal behavior.
p40
aVPretty scary.
p41
aa(lp42
VWell, does anything like that happen with human beings?
p43
aVThis is all on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness, of course.
p44
aVWell, it may already have occurred to you
p45
aVthat Islam means "surrender," or "submission of self-interest to the will of Allah."
p46
aVWell, it's ideas \u2014 not worms \u2014 that hijack our brains.
p47
aVNow, am I saying that a sizable minority of the world's population
p48
aVhas had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas?
p49
aVNo, it's worse than that.
p50
aVMost people have.
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aVThere are a lot of ideas to die for.
p53
aVFreedom, if you're from New Hampshire.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aVJustice. Truth. Communism.
p56
aVMany people have laid down their lives for communism,
p57
aVand many have laid down their lives for capitalism.
p58
aVAnd many for Catholicism. And many for Islam.
p59
aVThese are just a few of the ideas that are to die for.
p60
aVThey're infectious.
p61
aa(lp62
VYesterday, Amory Lovins spoke about "infectious repititis."
p63
aVIt was a term of abuse, in effect.
p64
aVThis is unthinking engineering.
p65
aVWell, most of the cultural spread that goes on
p66
aVis not brilliant, new, out-of-the-box thinking.
p67
aVIt's "infectious repetitis,"
p68
aVand we might as well try to have a theory of what's going on when that happens
p69
aVso that we can understand the conditions of infection.
p70
aVHosts work hard to spread these ideas to others.
p71
aVI myself am a philosopher, and one of our occupational hazards
p72
aVis that people ask us what the meaning of life is.
p73
aVAnd you have to have a bumper sticker,
p74
aVyou know. You have to have a statement.
p75
aVSo, this is mine.
p76
aa(lp77
VThe secret of happiness is: Find something more important than you are
p78
aVand dedicate your life to it.
p79
aVMost of us \u2014 now that the "Me Decade" is well in the past \u2014
p80
aVnow we actually do this.
p81
aVOne set of ideas or another
p82
aVhave simply replaced our biological imperatives in our own lives.
p83
aVThis is what our summum bonum is.
p84
aVIt's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have.
p85
aVNow, this is a profound biological effect.
p86
aVIt's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests.
p87
aVAnd no other species does anything at all like it.
p88
aa(lp89
VWell, how are we going to think about this?
p90
aVIt is, on the one hand, a biological effect, and a very large one.
p91
aVUnmistakable.
p92
aVNow, what theories do we want to use to look at this?
p93
aVWell, many theories. But how could something tie them together?
p94
aVThe idea of replicating ideas;
p95
aVideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain.
p96
aVRichard Dawkins, whom you'll be hearing later in the day, invented the term "memes,"
p97
aVand put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea
p98
aVin his book "The Selfish Gene."
p99
aVNow here am I talking about his idea.
p100
aVWell, you see, it's not his. Yes \u2014 he started it.
p101
aVBut it's everybody's idea now.
p102
aVAnd he's not responsible for what I say about memes.
p103
aVI'm responsible for what I say about memes.
p104
aa(lp105
VActually, I think we're all responsible
p106
aVfor not just the intended effects of our ideas,
p107
aVbut for their likely misuses.
p108
aVSo it is important, I think, to Richard, and to me,
p109
aVthat these ideas not be abused and misused.
p110
aVThey're very easy to misuse. That's why they're dangerous.
p111
aVAnd it's just about a full-time job
p112
aVtrying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas
p113
aVfrom caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another.
p114
aVSo we have to keep plugging away,
p115
aVtrying to correct the misapprehensions
p116
aVso that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread.
p117
aVBut it is a problem.
p118
aVWe don't have much time, and I'm going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out,
p119
aVbecause there's a lot of other things that are going to be said.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo let me just point out: memes are like viruses.
p122
aVThat's what Richard said, back in '93.
p123
aVAnd you might think, "Well, how can that be?
p124
aVI mean, a virus is \u2014 you know, it's stuff! What's a meme made of?"
p125
aVYesterday, Negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications
p126
aVbut \u2014 what's a virus?
p127
aVA virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude.
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aVThat is, there is something about it
p130
aVthat tends to make it replicate better than the competition does.
p131
aVAnd that's what a meme is. It's an information packet with attitude.
p132
aVWhat's a meme made of? What are bits made of, Mom?
p133
aVNot silicon.
p134
aVThey're made of information, and can be carried in any physical medium.
p135
aVWhat's a word made of?
p136
aVSometimes when people say, "Do memes exist?"
p137
aVI say, "Well, do words exist? Are they in your ontology?"
p138
aVIf they are, words are memes that can be pronounced.
p139
aa(lp140
VThen there's all the other memes that can't be pronounced.
p141
aVThere are different species of memes.
p142
aVRemember the Shakers? Gift to be simple?
p143
aVSimple, beautiful furniture?
p144
aVAnd, of course, they're basically extinct now.
p145
aVAnd one of the reasons is that among the creed of Shaker-dom
p146
aVis that one should be celibate.
p147
aVNot just the priests. Everybody.
p148
aVWell, it's not so surprising that they've gone extinct. (Laughter)
p149
aVBut in fact that's not why they went extinct.
p150
aVThey survived as long as they did
p151
aVat a time when the social safety nets weren't there.
p152
aVAnd there were lots of widows and orphans,
p153
aVpeople like that, who needed a foster home.
p154
aVAnd so they had a ready supply of converts.
p155
aVAnd they could keep it going.
p156
aVAnd, in principle, it could've gone on forever,
p157
aVwith perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts.
p158
aVThe idea being passed on through proselytizing,
p159
aVinstead of through the gene line.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo the ideas can live on in spite of the fact
p162
aVthat they're not being passed on genetically.
p163
aVA meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness.
p164
aVAfter all, the meme for Shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite.
p165
aVThere are other parasites that do this \u2014 which render the host sterile.
p166
aVIt's part of their plan.
p167
aVThey don't have to have minds to have a plan.
p168
aa(lp169
VI'm just going to draw your attention to just one
p170
aVof the many implications of the memetic perspective, which I recommend.
p171
aVI've not time to go into more of it.
p172
aVIn Jared Diamond's wonderful book, "Guns, Germs and Steel,"
p173
aVhe talks about how it was germs, more than guns and steel,
p174
aVthat conquered the new hemisphere \u2014 the Western hemisphere \u2014
p175
aVthat conquered the rest of the world.
p176
aVWhen European explorers and travelers spread out,
p177
aVthey brought with them the germs
p178
aVthat they had become essentially immune to,
p179
aVthat they had learned how to tolerate over
p180
aVhundreds and hundreds of years, thousands of years,
p181
aVof living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens.
p182
aVAnd they just wiped out \u2014 these pathogens just wiped out the native people,
p183
aVwho had no immunity to them at all.
p184
aa(lp185
VAnd we're doing it again.
p186
aVWe're doing it this time with toxic ideas.
p187
aVYesterday, a number of people \u2014 Nicholas Negroponte and others \u2014
p188
aVspoke about all the wonderful things
p189
aVthat are happening when our ideas get spread out,
p190
aVthanks to all the new technology all over the world.
p191
aVAnd I agree. It is largely wonderful. Largely wonderful.
p192
aVBut among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world
p193
aVthanks to our technology, are a lot of toxic ideas.
p194
aVNow, this has been realized for some time.
p195
aVSayyid Qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical Islam,
p196
aVone of the ideologues that inspired Osama bin Laden.
p197
aV"One has only to glance at its press films, fashion shows, beauty contests,
p198
aVballrooms, wine bars and broadcasting stations." Memes.
p199
aa(lp200
VThese memes are spreading around the world
p201
aVand they are wiping out whole cultures.
p202
aVThey are wiping out languages.
p203
aVThey are wiping out traditions and practices.
p204
aVAnd it's not our fault, anymore than it's our fault when our germs lay waste
p205
aVto people that haven't developed the immunity.
p206
aVWe have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture.
p207
aVWe're a free society, so we let pornography and all these things \u2014 we shrug them off.
p208
aVThey're like a mild cold.
p209
aVThey're not a big deal for us.
p210
aVBut we should recognize that for many people in the world,
p211
aVthey are a big deal.
p212
aVAnd we should be very alert to this.
p213
aVAs we spread our education and our technology,
p214
aVone of the things that we are doing is we're the vectors of memes
p215
aVthat are correctly viewed by the hosts of many other memes
p216
aVas a dire threat to their favorite memes \u2014
p217
aVthe memes that they are prepared to die for.
p218
aa(lp219
VWell now, how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes?
p220
aVThat is not the job of the science of memetics.
p221
aVMemetics is morally neutral. And so it should be.
p222
aVThis is not the place for hate and anger.
p223
aVIf you've had a friend who's died of AIDS, then you hate HIV.
p224
aVBut the way to deal with that is to do science,
p225
aVand understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral perspective.
p226
aa(lp227
VGet the facts.
p228
aVWork out the implications.
p229
aVThere's plenty of room for moral passion once we've got the facts
p230
aVand can figure out the best thing to do.
p231
aVAnd, as with germs, the trick is not to try to annihilate them.
p232
aVYou will never annihilate the germs.
p233
aVWhat you can do, however, is foster public health measures and the like
p234
aVthat will encourage the evolution of avirulence.
p235
aVThat will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations
p236
aVof the most toxic varieties.
p237
aVThat's all the time I have,
p238
aVso thank you very much for your attention.
