VToday I want to talk to you about
p4
aVswimming across the North Pole,
p5
aVacross the most northern place in the whole world.
p6
aVAnd perhaps the best place to start is with my late father.
p7
aVHe was a great storyteller.
p8
aVHe could tell a story about an event,
p9
aVand so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment.
p10
aVAnd one of the stories he told me so often when I was a young boy
p11
aVwas of the first British atomic bomb test.
p12
aVHe had been there and watched it go off.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd he said that the explosion was so loud
p15
aVand the light was so intense,
p16
aVthat he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes.
p17
aVAnd he said that he could actually see an x-ray
p18
aVof his fingers,
p19
aVbecause the light was so bright.
p20
aVAnd I know that watching that atomic bomb going off
p21
aVhad a very, very big impact on my late father.
p22
aVEvery holiday I had as a young boy
p23
aVwas in a national park.
p24
aVWhat he was trying to do with me was to inspire me
p25
aVto protect the world,
p26
aVand show me just how fragile the world is.
p27
aa(lp28
VHe also told me about the great explorers.
p29
aVHe loved history. He would tell me about Captain Scott
p30
aVwalking all the way to the South Pole
p31
aVand Sir Edmund Hillary climbing up Mount Everest.
p32
aVAnd so ever since I think I was just six years old,
p33
aVI dreamed of going to the polar regions.
p34
aVI really, really wanted to go to the Arctic.
p35
aVThere was something about that place
p36
aVwhich drew me to it.
p37
aVAnd, well, sometimes it takes a long time
p38
aVfor a dream to come true.
p39
aVBut seven years ago, I went to the Arctic
p40
aVfor the first time.
p41
aVAnd it was so beautiful that I've been back there
p42
aVever since, for the last seven years.
p43
aVI love the place.
p44
aa(lp45
VBut I have seen that place change
p46
aVbeyond all description,
p47
aVjust in that short period of time.
p48
aVI have seen polar bears walking across very, very thin ice
p49
aVin search of food.
p50
aVI have swum in front of glaciers
p51
aVwhich have retreated so much.
p52
aVAnd I have also, every year,
p53
aVseen less and less sea ice.
p54
aVAnd I wanted the world to know what was happening up there.
p55
aa(lp56
VIn the two years before my swim,
p57
aV23 percent of the arctic sea ice cover
p58
aVjust melted away.
p59
aVAnd I wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders
p60
aVto get them to understand what is happening.
p61
aVSo I decided to do this symbolic swim
p62
aVat the top of the world, in a place which should be frozen over,
p63
aVbut which now is rapidly unfreezing.
p64
aVAnd the message was very clear:
p65
aVClimate change is for real,
p66
aVand we need to do something about it.
p67
aVAnd we need to do something about it right now.
p68
aa(lp69
VWell, swimming across the North Pole,
p70
aVit's not an ordinary thing to do.
p71
aVI mean, just to put it in perspective,
p72
aV27 degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool.
p73
aVThis morning, the temperature of the English Channel was 18 degrees.
p74
aVThe passengers who fell off the Titanic
p75
aVfell into water of just five degrees centigrade.
p76
aVFresh water freezes at zero.
p77
aVAnd the water at the North Pole is minus 1.7.
p78
aVIt's fucking freezing.
p79
aV(Laughter)
p80
aV(Applause)
p81
aVI'm sorry, but there is no other way to describe it.
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd so I had to assemble an incredible team around me
p85
aVto help me with this task.
p86
aVI assembled this team of 29 people from 10 nations.
p87
aVSome people think that swimming is a very solo sport,
p88
aVyou just dive into the sea and off you go.
p89
aVIt couldn't be further from the truth for me.
p90
aVAnd I then went and did a huge amount of training,
p91
aVswimming in icy water, backwards and forwards.
p92
aa(lp93
VBut the most important thing was to train my mind
p94
aVto prepare myself for what was going to happen.
p95
aVAnd I had to visualize the swim.
p96
aVI had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end.
p97
aVI had to taste the salt water in my mouth.
p98
aVI had to see my coach screaming for me,
p99
aV"Come on Lewis! Come on! Go! Go! Go! Don't slow down!"
p100
aVAnd so I literally swam across the North Pole
p101
aVhundreds and hundreds of times in my mind.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd then, after a year of training, I felt ready.
p104
aVI felt confident that I could actually
p105
aVdo this swim.
p106
aVSo myself and the five members of the team,
p107
aVwe hitched a ride on an icebreaker
p108
aVwhich was going to the North Pole.
p109
aVAnd on day four, we decided to just do a quick
p110
aVfive minute test swim.
p111
aVI had never swum in water of minus 1.7 degrees before,
p112
aVbecause it's just impossible to train
p113
aVin those types of conditions.
p114
aVSo we stopped the ship, as you do.
p115
aVWe all got down onto the ice,
p116
aVand I then got into my swimming costume
p117
aVand I dived into the sea.
p118
aa(lp119
VI have never in my life felt anything
p120
aVlike that moment.
p121
aVI could barely breathe. I was gasping for air.
p122
aVI was hyperventilating so much,
p123
aVand within seconds my hands were numb.
p124
aVAnd it was \u2014 the paradox is
p125
aVthat you're in freezing cold water,
p126
aVbut actually you're on fire.
p127
aVI swam as hard as I could for five minutes.
p128
aVI remember just trying to get out of the water.
p129
aVI climbed out of the ice.
p130
aVAnd I remember taking the goggles off my face
p131
aVand looking down at my hands in sheer shock,
p132
aVbecause my fingers
p133
aVhad swollen so much that they were like sausages.
p134
aVAnd they were swollen so much, I couldn't even close them.
p135
aa(lp136
VWhat had happened is that we are made partially of water,
p137
aVand when water freezes it expands.
p138
aVAnd so what had actually happened is
p139
aVthat the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded.
p140
aVAnd they had burst. And I was in so much agony.
p141
aVI immediately got rushed onto the ship and into a hot shower.
p142
aa(lp143
VAnd I remember standing underneath the hot shower
p144
aVand trying to defrost my fingers.
p145
aVAnd I thought, in two days' time, I was going to do this swim across the North Pole.
p146
aVI was going to try and do a 20-minute swim,
p147
aVfor one kilometer across the North Pole.
p148
aVAnd this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy
p149
aVwith my father, was just going out the window.
p150
aVThere is no possibility that this was going to happen.
p151
aVAnd I remember then getting out of the shower
p152
aVand realizing I couldn't even feel my hands.
p153
aVAnd for a swimmer, you need to feel your hands
p154
aVbecause you need to be able to grab the water
p155
aVand pull it through with you.
p156
aa(lp157
VThe next morning, I woke up
p158
aVand I was in such a state of depression,
p159
aVand all I could think about was Sir Ranulph Fiennes.
p160
aVFor those of you who don't know him, he's the great British explorer.
p161
aVA number of years ago, he tried to ski all the way to the North Pole.
p162
aVHe accidentally fell through the ice into the sea.
p163
aVAnd after just three minutes in that water,
p164
aVhe was able
p165
aVto get himself out.
p166
aVAnd his hands were so badly frostbitten
p167
aVthat he had to return to England.
p168
aVHe went to a local hospital and there they said,
p169
aV"Ran, there is no possibility
p170
aVof us being able to save these fingers.
p171
aVWe are going to actually have to take them off."
p172
aVAnd Ran decided to go into his tool shed
p173
aVand take out a saw
p174
aVand do it himself.
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd all I could think of was, if that happened to Ran after three minutes,
p177
aVand I can't feel my hands after five minutes,
p178
aVwhat on earth is going to happen if I try 20 minutes?
p179
aVAt the very best, I'm going to end up losing some fingers.
p180
aVAnd at worst, I didn't even want to think about it.
p181
aVWe carried on sailing through the ice packs towards the North Pole.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd my close friend David, he saw the way I was thinking,
p184
aVand he came up to me and he said, "Lewis,
p185
aVI've known you since you were 18 years old.
p186
aVI've known you, and I know, Lewis,
p187
aVdeep down, right deep down here,
p188
aVthat you are going to make this swim.
p189
aVI so believe in you Lewis. I've seen the way you've been training.
p190
aVAnd I realize the reason why you're going to do this.
p191
aVThis is such an important swim.
p192
aVWe stand at a very, very important moment in this history,
p193
aVand you're going to make a symbolic swim here
p194
aVto try to shake the lapels of world leaders.
p195
aVLewis, have the courage to go in there,
p196
aVbecause we are going to look after you every moment of it."
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd I just, I got so much confidence from him saying that,
p199
aVbecause he knew me so well.
p200
aVSo we carried on sailing and we arrived at the North Pole.
p201
aVAnd we stopped the ship,
p202
aVand it was just as the scientists had predicted.
p203
aVThere were open patches of sea everywhere.
p204
aVAnd I went down into my cabin
p205
aVand I put on my swimming costume.
p206
aVAnd then the doctor strapped on a chest monitor,
p207
aVwhich measures my core body temperature
p208
aVand my heart rate.
p209
aVAnd then we walked out onto the ice.
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd I remember looking into the ice,
p212
aVand there were big chunks of white ice in there,
p213
aVand the water was completely black.
p214
aVI had never seen black water before.
p215
aVAnd it is 4,200 meters deep.
p216
aVAnd I said to myself, "Lewis, don't look left, don't look right.
p217
aVJust scuttle forward and go for it."
p218
aVAnd so I now want to show you a short video
p219
aVof what happened there on the ice.
p220
aa(lp221
VNarrator (Video): We're just sailing out of harbor now, and it's at this stage
p222
aVwhen one can have a bit of a wobble mentally.
p223
aVEverything just looks so gray around here,
p224
aVand looks so cold.
p225
aVWe've just seen our first polar bears.
p226
aVIt was absolutely magical.
p227
aVA mother and a cub, such a beautiful sight.
p228
aVAnd to think that in 30, 40 years
p229
aVthey could become extinct.
p230
aVIt's a very frightening, very, very frightening thought.
p231
aVWe're finally at the North Pole. This is
p232
aVmonths and months and months of dreaming to get here,
p233
aVyears of training and planning and preparation.
p234
aVOoh. In a couple of hours' time I'm going to get in here and do my swim.
p235
aVIt's all a little bit frightening,
p236
aVand emotional.
p237
aVAmundson, you ready? Amudson: Ready.
p238
aVLewis Pugh: Ten seconds to swim. Ten seconds to swim.
p239
aVTake the goggles off. Take the goggles off!
p240
aa(lp241
VMan: Take the shoes. Take the shoes.
p242
aVWell done lad! You did it! You did it Lewis!
p243
aVYou did it! You did it man!
p244
aa(lp245
VLP: How on earth did we do that?
p246
aa(lp247
VMan: Against the current! You did it against the current!
p248
aa(lp249
V(Applause)
p250
aa(lp251
VLP: Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
p252
aV(Applause)
p253
aVThank you so much.
p254
aa(lp255
VAudience: Encore!
p256
aV(Laughter)
p257
aa(lp258
VLP: I'd just like to end off by just saying this:
p259
aVIt took me four months again to feel my hands.
p260
aVBut was it worth it? Yes, absolutely it was.
p261
aVThere are very, very few people who don't know now
p262
aVabout what is happening in the Arctic.
p263
aVAnd people ask me, "Lewis, what can we do about climate change?"
p264
aa(lp265
VAnd I say to them,
p266
aVI think we need to do three things.
p267
aVThe first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down
p268
aVinto manageable chunks.
p269
aVYou saw during that video all those flags.
p270
aVThose flags represented the countries
p271
aVfrom which my team came from.
p272
aVAnd equally, when it comes to climate change,
p273
aVevery single country is going to have to make cuts.
p274
aVBritain, America, Japan,
p275
aVSouth Africa, the Congo.
p276
aVAll of us together, we're all on the same ship together.
p277
aa(lp278
VThe second thing we need to do is
p279
aVwe need to just look back
p280
aVat how far we have come
p281
aVin such a short period of time.
p282
aVI remember, just a few years ago, speaking about climate change,
p283
aVand people heckling me in the back
p284
aVand saying it doesn't even exist.
p285
aVI've just come back from giving a series of speeches
p286
aVin some of the poorest townships in South Africa
p287
aVto young children as young as 10 years old.
p288
aVFour or five children sitting behind a desk,
p289
aVand even in those poorest conditions,
p290
aVthey all have a very, very good grasp
p291
aVof climate change.
p292
aa(lp293
VWe need to believe in ourselves.
p294
aVNow is the time to believe.
p295
aVWe've come a long way. We're doing good.
p296
aVBut the most important thing we must do
p297
aVis, I think, we must all walk to the end of our lives
p298
aVand turn around, and ask ourselves a most fundamental question.
p299
aVAnd that is, "What type of world do we want to live in,
p300
aVand what decision are we going to make today
p301
aVto ensure that we all live
p302
aVin a sustainable world?"
p303
aVLadies and gentlemen, thank you very, very much.
