VBefore March, 2011, I was a photographic retoucher
p4
aVbased in New York City.
p5
aVWe're pale, gray creatures.
p6
aVWe hide in dark, windowless rooms,
p7
aVand generally avoid sunlight.
p8
aVWe make skinny models skinnier, perfect skin more perfect,
p9
aVand the impossible possible,
p10
aVand we get criticized in the press all the time,
p11
aVbut some of us are actually talented artists
p12
aVwith years of experience
p13
aVand a real appreciation for images and photography.
p14
aa(lp15
VOn March 11, 2011, I watched from home, as the rest
p16
aVof the world did, as the tragic events unfolded in Japan.
p17
aVSoon after, an organization I volunteer with,
p18
aVAll Hands Volunteers, were on the ground, within days,
p19
aVworking as part of the response efforts.
p20
aVI, along with hundreds of other volunteers,
p21
aVknew we couldn't just sit at home,
p22
aVso I decided to join them for three weeks.
p23
aa(lp24
VOn May the 13th, I made my way to the town of \u014cfunato.
p25
aVIt's a small fishing town in Iwate Prefecture,
p26
aVabout 50,000 people,
p27
aVone of the first that was hit by the wave.
p28
aVThe waters here have been recorded at reaching
p29
aVover 24 meters in height,
p30
aVand traveled over two miles inland.
p31
aVAs you can imagine, the town had been devastated.
p32
aa(lp33
VWe pulled debris from canals and ditches.
p34
aVWe cleaned schools. We de-mudded and gutted homes
p35
aVready for renovation and rehabilitation.
p36
aVWe cleared tons and tons of stinking, rotting fish carcasses
p37
aVfrom the local fish processing plant.
p38
aVWe got dirty, and we loved it.
p39
aa(lp40
VFor weeks, all the volunteers and locals alike
p41
aVhad been finding similar things.
p42
aVThey'd been finding photos and photo albums
p43
aVand cameras and SD cards.
p44
aVAnd everyone was doing the same.
p45
aVThey were collecting them up, and handing them in to
p46
aVvarious places around the different towns for safekeeping.
p47
aa(lp48
VNow, it wasn't until this point that I realized
p49
aVthat these photos were such a huge part
p50
aVof the personal loss these people had felt.
p51
aVAs they had run from the wave, and for their lives,
p52
aVabsolutely everything they had,
p53
aVeverything had to be left behind.
p54
aa(lp55
VAt the end of my first week there, I found myself
p56
aVhelping out in an evacuation center in the town.
p57
aVI was helping clean the onsen, the communal onsen,
p58
aVthe huge giant bathtubs.
p59
aVThis happened to also be a place in the town where
p60
aVthe evacuation center was collecting the photos.
p61
aVThis is where people were handing them in,
p62
aVand I was honored that day that they actually trusted me
p63
aVto help them start hand-cleaning them.
p64
aa(lp65
VNow, it was emotional and it was inspiring,
p66
aVand I've always heard about thinking outside the box,
p67
aVbut it wasn't until I had actually gotten outside of my box
p68
aVthat something happened.
p69
aVAs I looked through the photos, there were some
p70
aVwere over a hundred years old,
p71
aVsome still in the envelope from the processing lab,
p72
aVI couldn't help but think as a retoucher
p73
aVthat I could fix that tear and mend that scratch,
p74
aVand I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
p75
aVSo that evening, I just reached out on Facebook
p76
aVand asked a few of them, and by morning
p77
aVthe response had been so overwhelming and so positive,
p78
aVI knew we had to give it a go.
p79
aVSo we started retouching photos.
p80
aa(lp81
VThis was the very first.
p82
aVNot terribly damaged, but where the water had caused
p83
aVthat discoloration on the girl's face
p84
aVhad to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy.
p85
aVOtherwise, that little girl isn't going to look
p86
aVlike that little girl anymore, and surely that's as tragic
p87
aVas having the photo damaged.
p88
aV(Applause)
p89
aa(lp90
VOver time, more photos came in, thankfully,
p91
aVand more retouchers were needed,
p92
aVand so I reached out again on Facebook and LinkedIn,
p93
aVand within five days, 80 people wanted to help
p94
aVfrom 12 different countries.
p95
aVWithin two weeks, I had 150 people
p96
aVwanting to join in.
p97
aVWithin Japan, by July, we'd branched out
p98
aVto the neighboring town of Rikuzentakata,
p99
aVfurther north to a town called Yamada.
p100
aVOnce a week, we would set up our scanning equipment
p101
aVin the temporary photo libraries that had been set up,
p102
aVwhere people were reclaiming their photos.
p103
aVThe older ladies sometimes hadn't seen a scanner before,
p104
aVbut within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo,
p105
aVthey could give it to us, have it scanned,
p106
aVuploaded to a cloud server, it would be downloaded
p107
aVby a gaijin, a stranger,
p108
aVsomewhere on the other side of the globe,
p109
aVand it'd start being fixed.
p110
aa(lp111
VThe time it took, however, to get it back
p112
aVis a completely different story,
p113
aVand it depended obviously on the damage involved.
p114
aVIt could take an hour. It could take weeks.
p115
aVIt could take months.
p116
aVThe kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand-drawn,
p117
aVor pieced together, picking out the remaining parts of color
p118
aVand detail that the water hadn't damaged.
p119
aVIt was very time-consuming.
p120
aa(lp121
VNow, all these photos had been damaged by water,
p122
aVsubmerged in salt water, covered in bacteria,
p123
aVin sewage, sometimes even in oil, all of which over time
p124
aVis going to continue to damage them,
p125
aVso hand-cleaning them was a huge part of the project.
p126
aVWe couldn't retouch the photo unless it was cleaned,
p127
aVdry and reclaimed.
p128
aa(lp129
VNow, we were lucky with our hand-cleaning.
p130
aVWe had an amazing local woman who guided us.
p131
aVIt's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos.
p132
aVAs my team leader Wynne once said,
p133
aVit's like doing a tattoo on someone.
p134
aVYou don't get a chance to mess it up.
p135
aa(lp136
VThe lady who brought us these photos was lucky,
p137
aVas far as the photos go.
p138
aVShe had started hand-cleaning them herself and stopped
p139
aVwhen she realized she was doing more damage.
p140
aVShe also had duplicates.
p141
aVAreas like her husband and her face, which otherwise
p142
aVwould have been completely impossible to fix,
p143
aVwe could just put them together in one good photo,
p144
aVand remake the whole photo.
p145
aa(lp146
VWhen she collected the photos from us,
p147
aVshe shared a bit of her story with us.
p148
aVHer photos were found by her husband's colleagues
p149
aVat a local fire department in the debris
p150
aVa long way from where the home had once stood,
p151
aVand they'd recognized him.
p152
aVThe day of the tsunami, he'd actually been in charge
p153
aVof making sure the tsunami gates were closed.
p154
aVHe had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded.
p155
aVHer two little boys, not so little anymore, but her two boys
p156
aVwere both at school, separate schools.
p157
aVOne of them got caught up in the water.
p158
aVIt took her a week to find them all again
p159
aVand find out that they had all survived.
p160
aa(lp161
VThe day I gave her the photos also happened to be
p162
aVher youngest son's 14th birthday.
p163
aVFor her, despite all of this, those photos
p164
aVwere the perfect gift back to him,
p165
aVsomething he could look at again, something he remembered from before
p166
aVthat wasn't still scarred from that day in March
p167
aVwhen absolutely everything else in his life had changed
p168
aVor been destroyed.
p169
aa(lp170
VAfter six months in Japan,
p171
aV1,100 volunteers had passed through All Hands,
p172
aVhundreds of whom had helped us hand-clean
p173
aVover 135,000 photographs,
p174
aVthe large majority \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p175
aVa large majority of which did actually find their home again,
p176
aVimportantly.
p177
aVOver five hundred volunteers around the globe
p178
aVhelped us get 90 families hundreds of photographs back,
p179
aVfully restored and retouched.
p180
aVDuring this time, we hadn't really spent more than
p181
aVabout a thousand dollars in equipment and materials,
p182
aVmost of which was printer inks.
p183
aa(lp184
VWe take photos constantly.
p185
aVA photo is a reminder of someone or something,
p186
aVa place, a relationship, a loved one.
p187
aVThey're our memory-keepers and our histories,
p188
aVthe last thing we would grab
p189
aVand the first thing you'd go back to look for.
p190
aVThat's all this project was about,
p191
aVabout restoring those little bits of humanity,
p192
aVgiving someone that connection back.
p193
aa(lp194
VWhen a photo like this can be returned to someone like this,
p195
aVit makes a huge difference
p196
aVin the lives of the person receiving it.
p197
aa(lp198
VThe project's also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers.
p199
aVFor some of them, it's given them a connection
p200
aVto something bigger, giving something back,
p201
aVusing their talents on something
p202
aVother than skinny models and perfect skin.
p203
aa(lp204
VI would like to conclude by reading an email
p205
aVI got from one of them, Cindy,
p206
aVthe day I finally got back from Japan after six months.
p207
aa(lp208
V"As I worked, I couldn't help but think about the individuals
p209
aVand the stories represented in the images.
p210
aVOne in particular, a photo of women of all ages,
p211
aVfrom grandmother to little girl, gathered around a baby,
p212
aVstruck a chord, because a similar photo from my family,
p213
aVmy grandmother and mother, myself,
p214
aVand newborn daughter, hangs on our wall.
p215
aVAcross the globe, throughout the ages,
p216
aVour basic needs are just the same, aren't they?"
p217
aVThank you. (Applause)
