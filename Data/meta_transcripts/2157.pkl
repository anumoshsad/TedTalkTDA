VOur world has many superheroes.
p4
aVBut they have the worst of all superpowers: invisibility.
p5
aVFor example, the catadores,
p6
aVworkers who collect recyclable  materials for a living.
p7
aVCatadores emerged from  social inequality, unemployment,
p8
aVand the abundance of solid waste
p9
aVfrom the deficiency of the  waste collection system.
p10
aVCatadores provide a heavy,  honest and essential work
p11
aVthat benefits the entire population. But they are not acknowledged for it.
p12
aVHere in Brazil, they collect 90 percent of all the waste that's actually recycled.
p13
aa(lp14
VMost of the catadores work independently,
p15
aVpicking waste from the streets and  selling to junk yards at very low prices.
p16
aVThey may collect over 300 kilos
p17
aVin their bags, shopping carts,  bicycles and carroças.
p18
aVCarroças are carts built from wood or metal
p19
aVand found in several streets in Brazil,
p20
aVmuch like graffiti and street art.
p21
aVAnd this is how I first met these  marginalized superheroes.
p22
aa(lp23
VI am a graffiti artist and activist
p24
aVand my art is social, environmental  and political in nature.
p25
aVIn 2007, I took my work beyond walls and onto the carroças,
p26
aVas a new urban support for my message.
p27
aVBut at this time,  giving voice to the catadores.
p28
aVBy adding art and humor to the cause, it became more appealing,
p29
aVwhich helped call attention  to the catadores
p30
aVand improve their self-esteem.
p31
aVAnd also, they are famous now  on the streets, on mass media and social.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo, the thing is,
p34
aVI plunged into this universe  and have not stopped working since.
p35
aVI have painted over 200  carroças in many cities
p36
aVand have been invited to do exhibitions  and trips worldwide.
p37
aVAnd then I realized that catadores, in their invisibility,
p38
aVare not exclusive to Brazil.
p39
aVI met them in Argentina, Chile,
p40
aVBolivia, South Africa, Turkey
p41
aVand even in developed countries such as the United States and Japan.
p42
aVAnd this was when I realized that I needed to have more people join the cause
p43
aVbecause it's a big challenge.
p44
aVAnd then, I created a collaborative  movement called Pimp My Carroça \u2014
p45
aV(Laughter) \u2014 which is  a large crowdfunded event.
p46
aVThank you.
p47
aV(Applause).
p48
aVSo Pimp My Carroça is a large  crowdfunded event
p49
aVto help catadores and their carroças.
p50
aVCatadores are assisted by well-being  professionals and healthcare,
p51
aVlike physicians, dentists, podiatrists,  hair stylists, massage therapists
p52
aVand much more.
p53
aVBut also, they also receive safety shirts, gloves, raincoats and eyeglasses
p54
aVto see in high-definition the city,
p55
aVwhile their carroças are renovated by our incredible volunteers.
p56
aVAnd then they receive safety items, too:
p57
aVreflective tapes, horns and mirrors.
p58
aVThen, finally, painted by a street artist
p59
aVand become part of part of this huge,  amazing mobile art exhibition.
p60
aa(lp61
VPimp My Carroça took to the streets of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba.
p62
aVBut to meet the demand in other cities, including outside of Brazil,
p63
aVwe have created Pimpx, which is inspired by TEDx,
p64
aVand it's a simplified, do-it-yourself, crowdfunded edition of Pimp My Carroça.
p65
aVSo now everybody can join.
p66
aa(lp67
VIn two years, over 170 catadores, 800 volunteers and 200 street artists
p68
aVand more than 1,000 donors
p69
aVhave been involved in the  Pimp My Carroça movement,
p70
aVwhose actions have even been used in teaching recycling at a local school.
p71
aa(lp72
VSo catadores are leaving  invisibility behind
p73
aVand becoming increasingly respected and valued.
p74
aVBecause of their pimped carroças, they are able to fight back to prejudice,
p75
aVincrease their income and  their interaction with society.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo now, I'd like to challenge you  to start looking at and acknowledging
p78
aVthe catadores and other  invisible superheroes from your city.
p79
aVTry to see the world as one,  without boundaries or frontiers.
p80
aVBelieve it or not,
p81
aVthere are over 20 million  catadores worldwide.
p82
aVSo next time you see one,
p83
aVrecognize them as a vital part of our society.
p84
aVMuito obrigado, thank you.
p85
aV(Applause).
