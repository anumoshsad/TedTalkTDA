VWhen I'm starting talks like this,
p4
aVI usually do a whole spiel about sustainability
p5
aVbecause a lot of people out there don't know what that is.
p6
aVThis is a crowd that does know what it is,
p7
aVso I'll like just do like the 60-second crib-note version. Right?
p8
aVSo just bear with me. We'll go real fast, you know?
p9
aVFill in the blanks.
p10
aVSo, you know, sustainability, small planet.
p11
aVRight? Picture a little Earth, circling around the sun.
p12
aVYou know, about a million years ago,
p13
aVa bunch of monkeys fell out of trees,
p14
aVgot a little clever, harnessed fire,
p15
aVinvented the printing press,
p16
aVmade, you know, luggage with wheels on it.
p17
aVAnd, you know, built the society that we now live in.
p18
aVUnfortunately, while this society is, without a doubt,
p19
aVthe most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created,
p20
aVit's got some major, major flaws.
p21
aa(lp22
VOne of them is that every society has an ecological footprint.
p23
aVIt has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable.
p24
aVHow much stuff goes through your life,
p25
aVhow much waste is left behind you.
p26
aVAnd we, at the moment, in our society,
p27
aVhave a really dramatically unsustainable level of this.
p28
aVWe're using up about five planets.
p29
aVIf everybody on the planet lived the way we did,
p30
aVwe'd need between five, six, seven,
p31
aVsome people even say 10 planets to make it.
p32
aVClearly we don't have 10 planets.
p33
aVAgain, you know, mental, visual, 10 planets, one planet,
p34
aV10 planets, one planet. Right?
p35
aVWe don't have that. So that's one problem.
p36
aa(lp37
VThe second problem is that the planet that we have
p38
aVis being used in wildly unfair ways. Right?
p39
aVNorth Americans, such as myself, you know,
p40
aVwe're basically sort of wallowing, gluttonous hogs,
p41
aVand we're eating all sorts of stuff.
p42
aVAnd, you know, then you get all the way down
p43
aVto people who live in the Asia-Pacific region, or even more, Africa.
p44
aVAnd people simply do not have enough to survive.
p45
aVThis is producing all sorts of tensions,
p46
aVall sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing.
p47
aVAnd there's more and more people on the way. Right?
p48
aVSo, this is what the planet's going to look like in 20 years.
p49
aVIt's going to be a pretty crowded place, at least eight billion people.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo to make matters even more difficult, it's a very young planet.
p52
aVA third of the people on this planet are kids.
p53
aVAnd those kids are growing up in a completely different way
p54
aVthan their parents did, no matter where they live.
p55
aVThey've been exposed to this idea of our society, of our prosperity.
p56
aVAnd they may not want to live exactly like us.
p57
aVThey may not want to be Americans, or Brits,
p58
aVor Germans, or South Africans,
p59
aVbut they want their own version
p60
aVof a life which is more prosperous, and more dynamic,
p61
aVand more, you know, enjoyable.
p62
aVAnd all of these things combine to create
p63
aVan enormous amount of torque on the planet.
p64
aVAnd if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that torque,
p65
aVwe are going to find ourselves more and more and more quickly
p66
aVfacing situations which are simply unthinkable.
p67
aa(lp68
VEverybody in this room has heard the worst-case scenarios.
p69
aVI don't need to go into that.
p70
aVBut I will ask the question, what's the alternative?
p71
aVAnd I would say that, at the moment, the alternative is unimaginable.
p72
aVYou know, so on the one hand we have the unthinkable;
p73
aVon the other hand we have the unimaginable.
p74
aVWe don't know yet how to build a society
p75
aVwhich is environmentally sustainable,
p76
aVwhich is shareable with everybody on the planet,
p77
aVwhich promotes stability and democracy and human rights,
p78
aVand which is achievable in the time-frame necessary
p79
aVto make it through the challenges we face.
p80
aVWe don't know how to do this yet.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo what's Worldchanging?
p83
aVWell, Worldchanging you might think of
p84
aVas being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future.
p85
aVYou know, what we're out there doing is looking
p86
aVfor examples of tools, models and ideas,
p87
aVwhich, if widely adopted, would change the game.
p88
aVA lot of times, when I do a talk like this, I talk about things
p89
aVthat everybody in this room I'm sure has already heard of,
p90
aVbut most people haven't.
p91
aVSo I thought today I'd do something a little different,
p92
aVand talk about what we're looking for, rather than saying, you know,
p93
aVrather than giving you tried-and-true examples.
p94
aVTalk about the kinds of things we're scoping out.
p95
aVGive you a little peek into our editorial notebook.
p96
aVAnd given that I have 13 minutes to do this, this is going to go kind of quick.
p97
aVSo, I don't know, just stick with me. Right?
p98
aa(lp99
VSo, first of all, what are we looking for? Bright Green city.
p100
aVOne of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world
p101
aVfor changing the impact that we have on the planet
p102
aVis changing the way that we live in cities.
p103
aVWe're already an urban planet;
p104
aVthat's especially true in the developed world.
p105
aVAnd people who live in cities in the developed world
p106
aVtend to be very prosperous, and thus use a lot of stuff.
p107
aVIf we can change the dynamic,
p108
aVby first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable ...
p109
aVHere, for example, is Vancouver, which if you haven't been there,
p110
aVyou ought to go for a visit. It's a fabulous city.
p111
aVAnd they are doing density, new density,
p112
aVbetter than probably anybody else on the planet right now.
p113
aVThey're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars,
p114
aVwhich is a pretty great thing.
p115
aVSo you have density. You also have growth management.
p116
aVYou leave aside what is natural to be natural.
p117
aa(lp118
VThis is in Portland. That is an actual development.
p119
aVThat land there will remain pasture in perpetuity.
p120
aVThey've bounded the city with a line.
p121
aVNature, city. Nothing changes.
p122
aVOnce you do those things, you can start making all sorts of investments.
p123
aVYou can start doing things like, you know,
p124
aVtransit systems that actually work to transport people,
p125
aVin effective and reasonably comfortable manners.
p126
aVYou can also start to change what you build.
p127
aVThis is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London,
p128
aVwhich is one of the greenest buildings in the world. It's a fabulous place.
p129
aVWe're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity,
p130
aVthat recycle much of their water,
p131
aVthat are much more comfortable than standard buildings,
p132
aVuse all-natural light, etc., and, over time, cost less.
p133
aVGreen roofs. Bill McDonough covered that last night, so I won't dwell on that too much.
p134
aa(lp135
VBut once you also have people living
p136
aVin close proximity to each other,
p137
aVone of the things you can do is \u2014
p138
aVas information technologies develop \u2014
p139
aVyou can start to have smart places.
p140
aVYou can start to know where things are.
p141
aVWhen you know where things are, it becomes easier to share them.
p142
aVWhen you share them, you end up using less.
p143
aVSo one great example is car-share clubs,
p144
aVwhich are really starting to take off in the U.S.,
p145
aVhave already taken off in many places in Europe, and are a great example.
p146
aVIf you're somebody who drives, you know, one day a week,
p147
aVdo you really need your own car?
p148
aa(lp149
VAnother thing that information technology lets us do
p150
aVis start figuring out how to use less stuff
p151
aVby knowing, and by monitoring, the amount we're actually using.
p152
aVSo, here's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use,
p153
aVwhich I think is a pretty cool concept,
p154
aValthough I think it ought to work the other way around,
p155
aVthat it gets brighter the more you don't use.
p156
aVBut, you know, there may even be a simpler approach.
p157
aVWe could just re-label things.
p158
aVThis light switch that reads, on the one hand, flashfloods,
p159
aVand on the other hand, off.
p160
aVHow we build things can change as well.
p161
aVThis is a bio-morphic building.
p162
aVIt takes its inspiration in form from life.
p163
aVMany of these buildings are incredibly beautiful,
p164
aVand also much more effective.
p165
aVThis is an example of bio-mimicry,
p166
aVwhich is something we're really starting to look a lot more for.
p167
aVIn this case, you have a shell design
p168
aVwhich was used to create a new kind of exhaust fan, which is greatly more effective.
p169
aVThere's a lot of this stuff happening; it's really pretty remarkable.
p170
aVI encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you're into it.
p171
aVWe're starting to cover this more and more.
p172
aVThere's also neo-biological design,
p173
aVwhere more and more we're actually using life itself
p174
aVand the processes of life to become part of our industry.
p175
aVSo this, for example, is hydrogen-generating algae.
p176
aVSo we have a model in potential, an emerging model that we're looking for
p177
aVof how to take the cities most of us live in,
p178
aVand turn them into Bright Green cities.
p179
aa(lp180
VBut unfortunately, most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in.
p181
aVThey live in the emerging megacities of the developing world.
p182
aVAnd there's a statistic I often like to use,
p183
aVwhich is that we're adding a city of Seattle every four days,
p184
aVa city the size of Seattle to the planet every four days.
p185
aVI was giving a talk about two months ago,
p186
aVand this guy, who'd done some work with the U.N., came up to me
p187
aVand was really flustered, and he said, look,
p188
aVyou've got that totally wrong; it's totally wrong.
p189
aVIt's every seven days.
p190
aVSo, we're adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days,
p191
aVand most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in.
p192
aVMost of those cites are growing incredibly quickly.
p193
aVThey don't have existing infrastructure;
p194
aVthey have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty,
p195
aVand enormous numbers of people are trying to figure out
p196
aVhow to do things in new ways.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo what do we need in order to make developing nation
p199
aVmegacities into Bright Green megacities?
p200
aVWell, the first thing we need is, we need leapfrogging.
p201
aVAnd this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere.
p202
aVThe idea behind leapfrogging is that
p203
aVif you are a person, or a country, who is stuck in a situation
p204
aVwhere you don't have the tools and technologies that you need,
p205
aVthere's no reason for you to invest in last generation's technologies. Right?
p206
aVThat you're much better off, almost universally,
p207
aVlooking for a low-cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology.
p208
aVOne place we're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones. Right?
p209
aVAll throughout the developing world, people are going directly to cell phones,
p210
aVskipping the whole landline stage.
p211
aVIf there are landlines in many developing world cities,
p212
aVthey're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot
p213
aVand cost enormous amounts of money.
p214
aVSo I rather like this picture here.
p215
aVI particularly like the Ganesh in the background, talking on the cell phone.
p216
aVSo what we have, increasingly, is cell phones just permeating out through society.
p217
aVWe've heard all about this here this week,
p218
aVso I won't say too much more than that, other than to say
p219
aVwhat is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies.
p220
aa(lp221
VThe second thing is tools for collaboration,
p222
aVbe they systems of collaboration, or intellectual property systems
p223
aVwhich encourage collaboration. Right?
p224
aVWhen you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate,
p225
aVyou get different kinds of solutions.
p226
aVAnd those solutions are accessible in a different way
p227
aVto people who don't have capital. Right?
p228
aVSo, you know, we have open source software,
p229
aVwe have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions.
p230
aVAnd those things lead to things like this.
p231
aVThis is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo.
p232
aVThis is a pretty remarkable program
p233
aVusing free and open source software, cheap, sort of hacked-together machines,
p234
aVand basically sort of abandoned buildings \u2014
p235
aVhas put together a bunch of community centers
p236
aVwhere people can come in, get high-speed internet access,
p237
aVlearn computer programming skills for free.
p238
aVAnd a quarter-million people every year use these now in Sao Paulo.
p239
aVAnd those quarter-million people are some of the poorest people in Sao Paolo.
p240
aVI particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back. (Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VSo one of the things that that's leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion.
p243
aVAnd one of the things we're really, really interested in at Worldchanging
p244
aVis the ways in which the south is re-identifying itself,
p245
aVand re-categorizing itself in ways
p246
aVthat have less and less to do with most of us in this room.
p247
aVSo it's not, you know, Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood. Right?
p248
aVYou know, Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels.
p249
aVIt's doing something new. There's new things happening.
p250
aVThere's interplay between them. And, you know, you get amazing things.
p251
aVLike, I don't know if any of you have seen the movie "City of God?"
p252
aVYeah, it's a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it.
p253
aVAnd it's all about this question, in a very artistic and indirect kind of way.
p254
aa(lp255
VYou have other radical examples
p256
aVwhere the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out.
p257
aVThese are people who have just been visited by
p258
aVthe Internet bookmobile in Uganda.
p259
aVAnd who are waving their first books in the air,
p260
aVwhich, I just think that's a pretty cool picture. You know?
p261
aVSo you also have the ability for people to start coming together
p262
aVand acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways,
p263
aVin ways that haven't happened before.
p264
aVAnd as we heard last night, as we've heard earlier this week,
p265
aVare absolutely, fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions,
p266
aVis we've got to craft new political realities.
p267
aa(lp268
VAnd I would personally say that we have to craft new political realities,
p269
aVnot only in places like India, Afghanistan, Kenya, Pakistan,
p270
aVwhat have you, but here at home as well.
p271
aVAnother world is possible.
p272
aVAnd sort of the big motto of the anti-globalization movement. Right?
p273
aVWe tweak that a lot.
p274
aVWe talk about how another world isn't just possible; another world's here.
p275
aVThat it's not just that we have to sort of imagine
p276
aVthere being a different, vague possibility out there,
p277
aVbut we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility.
p278
aVWe need to start doing things like Lula, President of Brazil.
p279
aVHow many people knew of Lula before today?
p280
aVOK, so, much, much better than the average crowd, I can tell you that.
p281
aVSo Lula, he's full of problems, full of contradictions,
p282
aVbut one of the things that he's doing is,
p283
aVhe is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that
p284
aVcompletely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north-south dialogue
p285
aVinto a whole new way of global collaboration.
p286
aVI would keep your eye on this fellow.
p287
aa(lp288
VAnother example of this sort of second superpower thing
p289
aVis the rise of these games that are what we call "serious play."
p290
aVWe're looking a lot at this. This is spreading everywhere.
p291
aVThis is from "A Force More Powerful." It's a little screenshot.
p292
aV"A Force More Powerful" is a video game that,
p293
aVwhile you're playing it, it teaches you how to engage
p294
aVin non-violent insurrection and regime change. (Laughter)
p295
aVHere's another one. This is from a game called "Food Force,"
p296
aVwhich is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp.
p297
aVThese things are all contributing in a very dynamic way
p298
aVto a huge rise in, especially in the developing world,
p299
aVin people's interest in and passion for democracy.
p300
aVWe get so little news about the developing world
p301
aVthat we often forget that there are literally
p302
aVmillions of people out there struggling to change things
p303
aVto be fairer, freer, more democratic, less corrupt.
p304
aVAnd, you know, we don't hear those stories enough.
p305
aVBut it's happening all over the place,
p306
aVand these tools are part of what's making it possible.
p307
aa(lp308
VNow when you add all those things together,
p309
aVwhen you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools,
p310
aVyou know, second superpower stuff, etc., what do you get?
p311
aVWell, very quickly, you get a Bright Green future for the developing world.
p312
aVYou get, for example, green power spread throughout the world.
p313
aVYou get \u2014 this is a building in Hyderabad, India.
p314
aVIt's the greenest building in the world.
p315
aVYou get grassroots solutions, things that work
p316
aVfor people who have no capital or limited access.
p317
aVYou get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains.
p318
aVYou get access to distance medicine.
p319
aVThese are Indian nurses learning how to use PDAs
p320
aVto access databases that have information
p321
aVthat they don't have access to at home in a distant manner.
p322
aVYou get new tools for people in the developing world.
p323
aVThese are LED lights that help the roughly billion people out there,
p324
aVfor whom nightfall means darkness,
p325
aVto have a new means of operating.
p326
aVThese are refrigerators that require no electricity;
p327
aVthey're pot within a pot design.
p328
aa(lp329
VAnd you get water solutions. Water's one of the most pressing problems.
p330
aVHere's a design for harvesting rainwater that's super cheap
p331
aVand available to people in the developing world.
p332
aVHere's a design for distilling water using sunlight.
p333
aVHere's a fog-catcher, which, if you live in a moist, jungle-like area,
p334
aVwill distill water from the air that's clean and drinkable.
p335
aVHere's a way of transporting water.
p336
aVI just love this, you know \u2014 I mean carrying water is such a drag,
p337
aVand somebody just came up with the idea of well, what if you rolled it. Right?
p338
aVI mean, that's a great design.
p339
aVThis is a fabulous invention, LifeStraw.
p340
aVBasically you can suck any water through this
p341
aVand it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips.
p342
aVSo, you know, people who are in desperate straits can get this.
p343
aVThis is one of my favorite Worldchanging kinds of things ever.
p344
aVThis is a merry-go-round invented by the company Roundabout,
p345
aVwhich pumps water as kids play. You know?
p346
aVSeriously \u2014 give that one a hand, it's pretty great.
p347
aVAnd the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis. Right?
p348
aa(lp349
VWe're expecting to have upwards of 200 million refugees by the year 2020
p350
aVbecause of climate change and political instability.
p351
aVHow do we help people like that?
p352
aVWell, there's all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs
p353
aVthat are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet.
p354
aVSome of those designs include models for acting,
p355
aVsuch as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps.
p356
aVNew models for pedagogy for the displaced.
p357
aVAnd we have new tools.
p358
aVThis is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere.
p359
aVDoes anyone know what this is?
p360
aa(lp361
VAudience: It detects landmines.
p362
aa(lp363
VAlex Steffen: Exactly, this is a landmine-detecting flower.
p364
aVIf you are living in one of the places
p365
aVwhere the roughly half-billion unaccounted for mines are scattered,
p366
aVyou can fling these seeds out into the field.
p367
aVAnd as they grow up, they will grow up around the mines,
p368
aVtheir roots will detect the chemicals in them,
p369
aVand where the flowers turn red you don't step.
p370
aVYeah, so seeds that could save your life. You know?
p371
aa(lp372
V(Applause)
p373
aa(lp374
VI also love it because it seems to me
p375
aVthat the example, the tools we use to change the world,
p376
aVought to be beautiful in themselves.
p377
aVYou know, that it's not just enough to survive.
p378
aVWe've got to make something better than what we've got.
p379
aVAnd I think that we will.
p380
aVJust to wrap up, in the immortal words of H.G. Wells,
p381
aVI think that better things are on the way.
p382
aVI think that, in fact, that "all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning.
p383
aVAll that the human mind has accomplished
p384
aVis but the dream before the awakening."
p385
aVI hope that that turns out to be true.
p386
aVThe people in this room have given me more confidence than ever that it will.
p387
