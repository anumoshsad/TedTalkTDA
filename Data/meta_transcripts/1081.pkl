VAs a child,
p4
aVI was raised by native Hawaiian elders \u2014
p5
aVthree old women
p6
aVwho took care of me while my parents worked.
p7
aVThe year is 1963.
p8
aVWe're at the ocean.
p9
aVIt's twilight.
p10
aVWe're watching the rising of the stars
p11
aVand the shifting of the tides.
p12
aVIt's a stretch of beach we know so well.
p13
aVThe smooth stones on the sand
p14
aVare familiar to us.
p15
aVIf you saw these women on the street
p16
aVin their faded clothes,
p17
aVyou might dismiss them
p18
aVas poor and simple.
p19
aVThat would be a mistake.
p20
aVThese women are descendants
p21
aVof Polynesian navigators,
p22
aVtrained in the old ways
p23
aVby their elders,
p24
aVand now they're passing it on to me.
p25
aVThey teach me the names of the winds and the rains,
p26
aVof astronomy according to a genealogy of stars.
p27
aVThere's a new moon on the horizon.
p28
aVHawaiians say it's a good night for fishing.
p29
aVThey begin to chant.
p30
aa(lp31
V[Hawaiian chant]
p32
aa(lp33
VWhen they finish,
p34
aVthey sit in a circle
p35
aVand ask me to come to join them.
p36
aVThey want to teach me about my destiny.
p37
aVI thought every seven-year-old went through this.
p38
aV(Laughter)
p39
aV"Baby girl,
p40
aVsomeday the world will be in trouble.
p41
aVPeople will forget their wisdom.
p42
aVIt will take elders' voices
p43
aVfrom the far corners of the world
p44
aVto call the world into balance.
p45
aVYou will go far away.
p46
aVIt will sometimes be a lonely road.
p47
aVWe will not be there.
p48
aVBut you will look into the eyes
p49
aVof seeming strangers,
p50
aVand you will recognize your ohana,
p51
aVyour family.
p52
aVAnd it will take all of you.
p53
aVIt will take all of you."
p54
aVThese words, I hold onto
p55
aVall my life.
p56
aVBecause the idea of doing it alone
p57
aVterrifies me.
p58
aa(lp59
VThe year is 2007.
p60
aVI'm on a remote island in Micronesia.
p61
aVSatawal is one half-mile long
p62
aVby one mile wide.
p63
aVIt's the home of my mentor.
p64
aVHis name is Pius Mau Piailug.
p65
aVMau is a palu,
p66
aVa navigator priest.
p67
aVHe's also considered
p68
aVthe greatest wave finder in the world.
p69
aVThere are fewer than a handful
p70
aVof palu left on this island.
p71
aVTheir tradition is so extraordinary
p72
aVthat these mariners sailed
p73
aVthree million square miles across the Pacific
p74
aVwithout the use of instruments.
p75
aVThey could synthesize patterns in nature
p76
aVusing the rising and setting of stars,
p77
aVthe sequence and direction of waves,
p78
aVthe flight patterns of certain birds.
p79
aVEven the slightest hint of color
p80
aVon the underbelly of a cloud
p81
aVwould inform them
p82
aVand help them navigate with the keenest accuracy.
p83
aa(lp84
VWhen Western scientists would join Mau on the canoe
p85
aVand watch him go into the hull,
p86
aVit appeared that an old man
p87
aVwas going to rest.
p88
aVIn fact, the hull of the canoe
p89
aVis the womb of the vessel.
p90
aVIt is the most accurate place
p91
aVto feel the rhythm and sequence
p92
aVand direction of waves.
p93
aVMau was, in fact,
p94
aVgathering explicit data
p95
aVusing his entire body.
p96
aVIt's what he had been trained to do
p97
aVsince he was five years old.
p98
aVNow science may dismiss this methodology,
p99
aVbut Polynesian navigators use it today
p100
aVbecause it provides them
p101
aVan accurate determination
p102
aVof the angle and direction
p103
aVof their vessel.
p104
aa(lp105
VThe palu also had
p106
aVan uncanny ability
p107
aVto forecast weather conditions
p108
aVdays in advance.
p109
aVSometimes I'd be with Mau on a cloud-covered night
p110
aVand we'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island,
p111
aVand he would look out,
p112
aVand then he would say,
p113
aV"Okay, we go."
p114
aVHe saw that first glint of light \u2014
p115
aVhe knew what the weather was going to be three days from now.
p116
aa(lp117
VTheir achievements, intellectually and scientifically,
p118
aVare extraordinary,
p119
aVand they are so relevant
p120
aVfor these times that we are in
p121
aVwhen we are riding out storms.
p122
aVWe are in such a critical moment
p123
aVof our collective history.
p124
aVThey have been compared
p125
aVto astronauts \u2014
p126
aVthese elder navigators
p127
aVwho sail vast open oceans
p128
aVin double-hulled canoes
p129
aVthousands of miles
p130
aVfrom a small island.
p131
aVTheir canoes, our rockets;
p132
aVtheir sea, our space.
p133
aVThe wisdom of these elders
p134
aVis not a mere collection
p135
aVof stories about old people
p136
aVin some remote spot.
p137
aVThis is part of our collective narrative.
p138
aVIt's humanity's DNA.
p139
aVWe cannot afford to lose it.
p140
aa(lp141
VThe year is 2010.
p142
aVJust as the women in Hawaii
p143
aVthat raised me predicted,
p144
aVthe world is in trouble.
p145
aVWe live in a society
p146
aVbloated with data,
p147
aVyet starved for wisdom.
p148
aVWe're connected 24/7,
p149
aVyet anxiety,
p150
aVfear, depression and loneliness
p151
aVis at an all-time high.
p152
aVWe must course-correct.
p153
aVAn African shaman said,
p154
aV"Your society worships the jester
p155
aVwhile the king stands
p156
aVin plain clothes."
p157
aVThe link between the past and the future
p158
aVis fragile.
p159
aVThis I know intimately,
p160
aVbecause even as I travel
p161
aVthroughout the world
p162
aVto listen to these stories and record them,
p163
aVI struggle.
p164
aVI am haunted
p165
aVby the fact that I no longer remember
p166
aVthe names of the winds and the rains.
p167
aa(lp168
VMau passed away
p169
aVfive months ago,
p170
aVbut his legacy and lessons live on.
p171
aVAnd I am reminded
p172
aVthat throughout the world
p173
aVthere are cultures
p174
aVwith vast sums of knowledge in them,
p175
aVas potent as the Micronesian navigators,
p176
aVthat are going dismissed,
p177
aVthat this is a testament
p178
aVto brilliant, brilliant
p179
aVtechnology and science and wisdom
p180
aVthat is vanishing rapidly.
p181
aVBecause when an elder dies a library is burned,
p182
aVand throughout the world, libraries are ablaze.
p183
aa(lp184
VI am grateful for the fact
p185
aVthat I had a mentor like Mau
p186
aVwho taught me how to navigate.
p187
aVAnd I realize
p188
aVthrough a lesson that he shared
p189
aVthat we continue to find our way.
p190
aVAnd this is what he said:
p191
aV"The island is the canoe;
p192
aVthe canoe, the island."
p193
aVAnd what he meant was,
p194
aVif you are voyaging
p195
aVand far from home,
p196
aVyour very survival depends
p197
aVon everyone aboard.
p198
aVYou cannot make the voyage alone,
p199
aVyou were never meant to.
p200
aVThis whole notion of every man for himself
p201
aVis completely unsustainable.
p202
aVIt always was.
p203
aa(lp204
VSo in closing I would offer you this:
p205
aVThe planet is our canoe,
p206
aVand we are the voyagers.
p207
aVTrue navigation
p208
aVbegins in the human heart.
p209
aVIt's the most important map of all.
p210
aVTogether, may we journey well.
