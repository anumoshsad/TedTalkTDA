(lp3
VI'd like to do pretty much what I did the first time,
p4
aVwhich is to choose a light-hearted theme.
p5
aVLast time, I talked about death and dying.
p6
aVThis time, I'm going to talk about mental illness.
p7
aVBut it has to be technological,
p8
aVso I'll talk about electroshock therapy. (Laughter)
p9
aa(lp10
VYou know, ever since man had any notion
p11
aVthat some of his other people, his colleagues,
p12
aVcould be different, could be strange, could be severely depressed
p13
aVor what we now recognize as schizophrenia,
p14
aVhe was certain that this kind of illness
p15
aVhad to come from evil spirits getting into the body.
p16
aVSo, the way of treating these diseases
p17
aVin early times was to, in some way or other,
p18
aVexorcise those evil spirits, and this is still going on, as you know.
p19
aa(lp20
VBut it wasn't enough to use the priests.
p21
aVWhen medicine became somewhat scientific, in about 450 BC,
p22
aVwith Hippocrates and those boys,
p23
aVthey tried to look for herbs, plants
p24
aVthat would literally shake the bad spirits out.
p25
aVSo, they found certain plants that could cause convulsions.
p26
aVAnd the herbals, the botanical books of up to the late Middle Ages,
p27
aVthe Renaissance are filled with prescriptions
p28
aVfor causing convulsions to shake the evil spirits out.
p29
aa(lp30
VFinally, in about the sixteenth century,
p31
aVa physician whose name was Theophrastus Bombastus Aureolus von Hohenheim,
p32
aVcalled Paracelsus, a name probably familiar to some people here \u2014
p33
aV(Laughter) \u2014 good, old Paracelsus
p34
aVfound that he could predict the degree of convulsion
p35
aVby using a measured amount of camphor to produce the convulsion.
p36
aVCan you imagine going to your closet, pulling out a mothball, and
p37
aVchewing on it if you're feeling depressed?
p38
aVIt's better than Prozac, but I wouldn't recommend it.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo what we see in the seventeenth, eighteenth century
p41
aVis the continued search for medications other than camphor that'll do the trick.
p42
aVWell, along comes Benjamin Franklin,
p43
aVand he comes close to convulsing himself
p44
aVwith a bolt of electricity off the end of his kite.
p45
aVAnd so people begin thinking in terms of electricity to produce convulsions.
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd then, we fast-forward to about 1932,
p48
aVwhen three Italian psychiatrists, who were largely treating depression,
p49
aVbegan to notice among their patients, who were also epileptics,
p50
aVthat if they had an epileptic \u2014 a series of epileptic fits,
p51
aVa lot of them in a row \u2014 the depression would very frequently lift.
p52
aVNot only would it lift, but it might never return.
p53
aVSo they got very interested in producing convulsions,
p54
aVmeasured types of convulsions.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd they thought, "Well, we've got electricity, we'll plug somebody into the wall.
p57
aVThat always makes hair stand up and people shake a lot."
p58
aVSo, they tried it on a few pigs, and none of the pigs were killed.
p59
aVSo, they went to the police and they said,
p60
aV"We know that at the Rome railroad station,
p61
aVthere are all these lost souls wandering around,
p62
aVmuttering gibberish. Can you bring one of them to us?"
p63
aVSomeone who is, as the Italians say, "cagoots."
p64
aVSo they found this "cagoots" guy,
p65
aVa 39-year-old man who was really hopelessly schizophrenic,
p66
aVwho was known, had been known for months,
p67
aVto be literally defecating on himself,
p68
aVtalking nothing that made any sense,
p69
aVand they brought him into the hospital.
p70
aVSo these three psychiatrists, after about two or three weeks of observation,
p71
aVlaid him down on a table,
p72
aVconnected his temples to a very small source of current.
p73
aVThey thought, "Well, we'll try 55 volts, two-tenths of a second.
p74
aVThat's not going to do anything terrible to him."
p75
aVSo they did that.
p76
aa(lp77
VWell, I have the following from a firsthand observer,
p78
aVwho told me this about 35 years ago,
p79
aVwhen I was thinking about these things
p80
aVfor some research project of mine.
p81
aVHe said, "This fellow" \u2014 remember, he wasn't even put to sleep \u2014
p82
aV"after this major grand mal convulsion,
p83
aVsat right up, looked at these three fellas and said,
p84
aV'What the fuck are you assholes trying to do?' "
p85
aV(Laughter)
p86
aVIf I could only say that in Italian.
p87
aa(lp88
VWell, they were happy as could be, because he
p89
aVhadn't said a rational word in the weeks of observation.
p90
aVSo they plugged him in again,
p91
aVand this time they used 110 volts for half a second.
p92
aVAnd to their amazement, after it was over,
p93
aVhe began speaking like he was perfectly well.
p94
aVHe relapsed a little bit, they gave him a series of treatments,
p95
aVand he was essentially cured.
p96
aVBut of course, having schizophrenia,
p97
aVwithin a few months, it returned.
p98
aa(lp99
VBut they wrote a paper about this,
p100
aVand everybody in the Western world began using electricity
p101
aVto convulse people who were either schizophrenic or severely depressed.
p102
aVIt didn't work very well on the schizophrenics,
p103
aVbut it was pretty clear in the '30s and by the middle of the '40s
p104
aVthat electroconvulsive therapy was very, very effective
p105
aVin the treatment of depression.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd of course, in those days, there were no antidepressant drugs,
p108
aVand it became very, very popular.
p109
aVThey would anesthetize people,
p110
aVconvulse them, but the real difficulty was
p111
aVthat there was no way to paralyze muscles.
p112
aVSo people would have a real grand mal seizure.
p113
aVBones were broken. Especially in old, fragile people,
p114
aVyou couldn't use it.
p115
aVAnd then in the 1950s, late 1950s, the so-called muscle relaxants
p116
aVwere developed by pharmacologists,
p117
aVand it got so that you could induce a complete convulsion,
p118
aVan electroencephalographic convulsion \u2014 you could see it on the brain waves \u2014
p119
aVwithout causing any convulsion in the body except a little bit of twitching of the toes.
p120
aVSo again, it was very, very popular and very, very useful.
p121
aa(lp122
VWell, you know, in the middle '60s,
p123
aVthe first antidepressants came out. Tofranil was the first.
p124
aVIn the late '70s, early '80s, there were others,
p125
aVand they were very effective.
p126
aVAnd patients' rights groups seemed to get very upset
p127
aVabout the kinds of things that they would witness.
p128
aVAnd so the whole idea of electroconvulsive, electroshock therapy disappeared,
p129
aVbut has had a renaissance in the last 10 years.
p130
aVAnd the reason that it has had a renaissance
p131
aVis that probably about 10 percent of the people, severe depressives,
p132
aVdo not respond, regardless of what is done for them.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow, why am I telling you this story at this meeting?
p135
aVI'm telling you this story, because actually ever since
p136
aVRichard called me and asked me to talk about
p137
aV\u2014 as he asked all of his speakers \u2014
p138
aVto talk about something that would be new to this audience,
p139
aVthat we had never talked about, never written about,
p140
aVI've been planning this moment.
p141
aVThis reason really is that I am a man who, almost 30 years ago,
p142
aVhad his life saved by two long courses of electroshock therapy.
p143
aVAnd let me tell you this story.
p144
aa(lp145
VI was, in the 1960s, in a marriage. To use the word bad
p146
aVwould be perhaps the understatement of the year.
p147
aVIt was dreadful.
p148
aVThere are, I'm sure, enough divorced people in this room
p149
aVto know about the hostility, the anger, who knows what.
p150
aVBeing someone who had had a very difficult childhood,
p151
aVa very difficult adolescence \u2014
p152
aVit had to do with not quite poverty but close.
p153
aVIt had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke English,
p154
aVno one could read or write English.
p155
aVIt had to do with death and disease and lots of other things.
p156
aVI was a little prone to depression.
p157
aa(lp158
VSo, as things got worse, as we really began to hate each other,
p159
aVI became progressively depressed over a period of a couple of years,
p160
aVtrying to save this marriage,
p161
aVwhich was inevitably not to be saved.
p162
aVFinally, I would schedule \u2014 all my major surgical cases,
p163
aVI was scheduling them for 12, one o'clock in the afternoon,
p164
aVbecause I couldn't get out of bed before about 11 o'clock.
p165
aVAnd anybody who's been depressed here knows what that's like.
p166
aVI couldn't even pull the covers off myself.
p167
aa(lp168
VWell, you're in a university medical center,
p169
aVwhere everybody knows everybody, and it's perfectly clear to my colleagues,
p170
aVso my referrals began to decrease.
p171
aVAs my referrals began to decrease,
p172
aVI clearly became increasingly depressed
p173
aVuntil I thought, my God, I can't work anymore.
p174
aVAnd, in fact, it didn't make any difference
p175
aVbecause I didn't have any patients anymore.
p176
aa(lp177
VSo, with the advice of my physician,
p178
aVI had myself admitted to the acute care psychiatric unit of our university hospital.
p179
aVAnd my colleagues, who had known me since medical school
p180
aVin that place, said, "Don't worry, chap. Six weeks,
p181
aVyou're back in the operating room. Everything's going to be great."
p182
aVWell, you know what bovine stercus is?
p183
aVThat proved to be a lot of bovine stercus.
p184
aVI know some people who got tenure in that place with lies like that.
p185
aV(Laughter)
p186
aVSo I was one of their failures.
p187
aa(lp188
VBut it wasn't that simple. Because by the time
p189
aVI got out of that unit, I was not functional at all.
p190
aVI could hardly see five feet in front of myself.
p191
aVI shuffled when I walked. I was bowed over.
p192
aVI rarely bathed. I sometimes didn't shave. It was dreadful.
p193
aVAnd it was clear \u2014 not to me,
p194
aVbecause nothing was clear to me at that time anymore \u2014
p195
aVthat I would need long-term hospitalization
p196
aVin that awful place called a mental hospital.
p197
aVSo I was admitted, in 1973, in the spring of 1973,
p198
aVto the Institute of Living, which used to be called the Hartford Retreat.
p199
aVIt was founded in the eighteenth century,
p200
aVthe largest psychiatric hospital in the state of
p201
aVConnecticut, other than the huge public hospitals
p202
aVthat existed at that time.
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd they tried everything they had.
p205
aVThey tried the usual psychotherapy.
p206
aVThey tried every medication available in those days.
p207
aVAnd they did have Tofranil and other things \u2014 Mellaril, who knows what.
p208
aVNothing happened except that I got jaundiced from one of these things.
p209
aVAnd finally, because I was well known in Connecticut,
p210
aVthey decided they better have a meeting of the senior staff.
p211
aVAll the senior staff got together, and I later found out what happened.
p212
aa(lp213
VThey put all their heads together and they decided
p214
aVthat there was nothing that could be done
p215
aVfor this surgeon who had essentially separated himself from the world,
p216
aVwho by that time had become so overwhelmed,
p217
aVnot just with depression and feelings
p218
aVof worthlessness and inadequacy,
p219
aVbut with obsessional thinking,
p220
aVobsessional thinking about coincidences.
p221
aVAnd there were particular numbers that every time I saw them,
p222
aVjust got me dreadfully upset \u2014 all kinds of ritualistic observances,
p223
aVjust awful, awful stuff.
p224
aVRemember when you were a kid, and you had to step on every line?
p225
aVWell, I was a grown man who had all of these rituals,
p226
aVand it got so there was a throbbing, there was a ferocious fear in my head.
p227
aVYou've seen this painting by Edvard Munch,
p228
aVThe Scream. Every moment was a scream.
p229
aVIt was impossible. So they decided there was no therapy,
p230
aVthere was no treatment. But there was one treatment,
p231
aVwhich actually had been pioneered at the Hartford hospital in the early 1940s,
p232
aVand you can imagine what it was. It was pre-frontal lobotomy.
p233
aVSo they decided \u2014 I didn't know this, again,
p234
aVI found this out later \u2014
p235
aVthat the only thing that could be done was
p236
aVfor this 43-year-old man to have a pre-frontal
p237
aVlobotomy.
p238
aa(lp239
VWell, as in all hospitals, there was a resident
p240
aVassigned to my case. He was 27 years old,
p241
aVand he would meet with me two or three times a week.
p242
aVAnd of course, I had been there, what, three or four months at the time.
p243
aVAnd he asked to meet with the senior staff, and they agreed to meet with him
p244
aVbecause he was very well thought of in that place.
p245
aVThey thought he had a really extraordinary future.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd he dug in his heels and said,
p248
aV"No. I know this man better than any of you. I have met with him over and over again.
p249
aVYou've just seen him from time to time. You've read reports and so forth.
p250
aVI really honestly believe that the basic problem here is pure depression,
p251
aVand all of the obsessional thinking comes out of it.
p252
aVAnd you know, of course, what'll happen if you do a pre-frontal lobotomy.
p253
aVAny of the results along the spectrum,
p254
aVfrom pretty bad to terrible, terrible, terrible
p255
aVis going to happen. If he does the best he can,
p256
aVhe will have no further obsessions,
p257
aVprobably no depression, but his affect will be dulled,
p258
aVhe will never go back to surgery,
p259
aVhe will never be the loving father that he was to his two children,
p260
aVhis life will be changed. If he has the usual result,
p261
aVhe will end up like 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'
p262
aVAnd you know about that, just essentially in a stupor the rest of his life."
p263
aa(lp264
VWell, he said, "Can't we try a course of electroshock therapy?"
p265
aVAnd you know why they agreed? They agreed to humor him.
p266
aVThey just thought, "Well, we'll give a course of 10.
p267
aVAnd so we'll lose a little time. Big deal. It doesn't make any difference."
p268
aVSo they gave the course of 10,
p269
aVand the first \u2014 the usual course, incidentally, was six to eight
p270
aVand still is six to eight.
p271
aVPlugged me into the wires, put me to sleep, gave me the muscle relaxant.
p272
aVSix didn't work. Seven didn't work.
p273
aVEight didn't work. At nine, I noticed \u2014
p274
aVand it's wonderful that I could notice anything
p275
aV\u2014 I noticed a change. And at 10, I noticed a real change.
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd he went back to them, and they agreed to do another 10.
p278
aVAgain, not a single one of them
p279
aV\u2014 I think there are about seven or eight of them \u2014
p280
aVthought this would do any good. They thought this was a temporary change.
p281
aVBut, lo and behold, by 16, by 17,
p282
aVthere were demonstrable differences in the way I felt.
p283
aVBy 18 and 19, I was sleeping through the night.
p284
aVAnd by 20, I had the sense, I really had the sense
p285
aVthat I could overcome this,
p286
aVthat I was now strong enough that by an act of will,
p287
aVI could blow the obsessional thinking away.
p288
aVI could blow the depression away.
p289
aa(lp290
VAnd I've never forgotten \u2014 I never will forget
p291
aV\u2014 standing in the kitchen of the unit,
p292
aVit was a Sunday morning in January of 1974,
p293
aVstanding in the kitchen by myself and thinking, "I've got the strength now to do this."
p294
aVIt was as though those tightly coiled wires in my head had been disconnected
p295
aVand I could think clearly.
p296
aVBut I need a formula. I need some thing to say to myself
p297
aVwhen I begin thinking obsessionally, obsessively.
p298
aVWell, the Gilbert and Sullivan fans in this room
p299
aVwill remember "Ruddigore," and they will remember Mad Margaret,
p300
aVand they will remember that she was married
p301
aVto a fellow named Sir Despard Murgatroyd.
p302
aVAnd she used to go nuts, every five minutes or so in the play,
p303
aVand he said to her, "We must have a word to bring you back to reality,
p304
aVand the word, my dear, will be 'Basingstoke.'"
p305
aVSo every time she got a little nuts,
p306
aVhe would say, "Basingstoke!" And she would say,
p307
aV"Basingstoke, it is." And she would be fine for a little while.
p308
aa(lp309
VWell, you know, I'm from the Bronx. I can't say "Basingstoke."
p310
aVBut I had something better. And it was very simple.
p311
aVIt was, "Ah, fuck it!"
p312
aV(Laughter) Much better than "Basingstoke,"
p313
aVat least for me. And it worked \u2014 my God, it worked.
p314
aVEvery time I would begin thinking obsessionally \u2014
p315
aVagain, once more, after 20 shock treatments
p316
aV\u2014 I would say, "Ah, fuck it."
p317
aVAnd things got better and better,
p318
aVand within three or four months,
p319
aVI was discharged from that hospital, and I joined a group of surgeons
p320
aVwhere I could work with other people in the community,
p321
aVnot in New Haven, but fairly close by.
p322
aVI stayed there for three years.
p323
aVAt the end of three years, I went back to New Haven,
p324
aVhad remarried by that time.
p325
aVI brought my wife with me, actually, to make sure I could get through this.
p326
aVMy children came back to live with us.
p327
aVWe had two more children after that.
p328
aVResuscitated the career, even better than it had been before.
p329
aVWent right back into the university
p330
aVand began to write books.
p331
aVWell, you know, it's been a wonderful life.
p332
aVIt's been, as I said, close to 30 years.
p333
aVI stopped doing surgery about six years ago
p334
aVand became a full-time writer, as many people know.
p335
aVBut it's been very exciting. It's been very happy.
p336
aa(lp337
VEvery once in a while, I have to say, "Ah, fuck it."
p338
aVEvery once in a while, I get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional.
p339
aVSo, I'm not free of all of this. But it's worked. It's always worked.
p340
aVWhy have I chosen, after never, ever talking about this, to talk about it now?
p341
aVWell, those of you who know some of these books
p342
aVknow that one is about death and dying,
p343
aVone is about the human body and the human spirit,
p344
aVone is about the way mystical thoughts are constantly in our minds,
p345
aVand they have always to do with my own personal experiences.
p346
aVOne might think reading these books
p347
aV\u2014 and I've gotten thousands of letters about them
p348
aVby people who do think this \u2014
p349
aVthat based on my life's history as I've portrayed in the books,
p350
aVmy early life's history, I am someone who has overcome adversity.
p351
aVThat I am someone who has drunk, drank, drunk
p352
aVof the bitter dregs of near-disaster in childhood
p353
aVand emerged not just unscathed but strengthened.
p354
aVI really have it figured out, so that I can advise people about
p355
aVdeath and dying, so that I can talk about mysticism and the human spirit.
p356
aa(lp357
VAnd I've always felt guilty about that.
p358
aVI've always felt that somehow I was an impostor
p359
aVbecause my readers don't know what I have just told you.
p360
aVIt's known by some people in New Haven, obviously,
p361
aVbut it is not generally known.
p362
aVSo one of the reasons that I have come here to talk about this today
p363
aVis to \u2014 frankly, selfishly \u2014
p364
aVunburden myself and let it be known
p365
aVthat this is not an untroubled mind that has written all of these books.
p366
aVBut more importantly, I think,
p367
aVis the fact that a very significant proportion
p368
aVof people in this audience are under 30,
p369
aVand there are many, of course, who are well over 30.
p370
aVFor people under 30, and it looks to me like almost all of you
p371
aV\u2014 I would say all of you \u2014
p372
aVare either on the cusp of a magnificent and exciting career
p373
aVor right into a magnificent and exciting career:
p374
aVanything can happen to you. Things change.
p375
aVAccidents happen. Something from childhood comes back to haunt you.
p376
aVYou can be thrown off the track.
p377
aVI hope it happens to none of you,
p378
aVbut it will probably happen to a small percentage of you.
p379
aa(lp380
VTo those to whom it doesn't happen, there will be adversities.
p381
aVIf I, with the bleakness of spirit,
p382
aVwith no spirit, that I had in the 1970s
p383
aVand no possibility of recovery,
p384
aVas far as that group of very experienced psychiatrists thought,
p385
aVif I can find my way back from this,
p386
aVbelieve me, anybody can find their way back
p387
aVfrom any adversity that exists in their lives.
p388
aa(lp389
VAnd for those who are older, who have lived through
p390
aVperhaps not something as bad as this,
p391
aVbut who have lived through difficult times,
p392
aVperhaps where they lost everything, as I did,
p393
aVand started out all over again, some of these things will seem very familiar.
p394
aVThere is recovery.
p395
aVThere is redemption. And there is resurrection.
p396
aVThere are resurrection themes in every society that has ever been studied,
p397
aVand it is because not just only do we fantasize
p398
