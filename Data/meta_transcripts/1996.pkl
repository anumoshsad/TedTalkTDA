VSo today's top chef class is in how to rob a bank,
p4
aVand it's clear that the general public needs guidance,
p5
aVbecause the average bank robbery nets
p6
aVonly 7,500 dollars.
p7
aVRank amateurs who know nothing
p8
aVabout how to cook the books.
p9
aa(lp10
VThe folks who know, of course,
p11
aVrun our largest banks,
p12
aVand in the last go-around,
p13
aVthey cost us over 11 trillion dollars.
p14
aVThat's what 11 trillion looks like.
p15
aVThat's how many zeros?
p16
aVAnd cost us over 10 million jobs as well.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo our task is to educate ourselves
p19
aVso that we can understand
p20
aVwhy we have these recurrent,
p21
aVintensifying financial crises,
p22
aVand how we can prevent them in the future.
p23
aVAnd the answer to that is
p24
aVthat we have to stop epidemics of control fraud.
p25
aVControl fraud is what happens
p26
aVwhen the people who control,
p27
aVtypically a CEO,
p28
aVa seemingly legitimate entity,
p29
aVuse it as a weapon to defraud.
p30
aVAnd these are the weapons of mass destruction
p31
aVin the financial world.
p32
aa(lp33
VThey also follow in finance a particular strategy,
p34
aVbecause the weapon of choice in finance
p35
aVis accounting,
p36
aVand there is a recipe for accounting
p37
aVcontrol fraud, and how it occurs.
p38
aVAnd we discovered this recipe
p39
aVin quite an odd way that I'll come back to in a moment.
p40
aVFirst ingredient in the recipe: grow like crazy;
p41
aVsecond, by making or buying really crappy loans,
p42
aVbut loans that are made at a very high interest rate
p43
aVor yield;
p44
aVthree, while employing extreme leverage \u2014
p45
aVthat just means a lot of debt \u2014
p46
aVcompared to your equity;
p47
aVand four, while providing only trivial loss reserves
p48
aVagainst the inevitable losses.
p49
aVIf you follow those four simple steps,
p50
aVand any bank can follow them,
p51
aVthen you are mathematically guaranteed
p52
aVto have three things occur.
p53
aVThe first thing is
p54
aVyou will report record bank profits \u2014
p55
aVnot just high, record.
p56
aVTwo, the CEO will immediately be made incredibly wealthy
p57
aVby modern executive compensation.
p58
aVAnd three, farther down the road,
p59
aVthe bank will suffer catastrophic losses
p60
aVand will fail unless it is bailed out.
p61
aVAnd that's a hint as to how
p62
aVwe discovered this recipe,
p63
aVbecause we discovered it through an autopsy process.
p64
aVDuring the savings and loan debacle in 1984,
p65
aVwe looked at every single failure,
p66
aVand we looked for common characteristics,
p67
aVand we discovered this recipe was common
p68
aVto each of these frauds.
p69
aVIn other words, a coroner could find these things
p70
aVbecause this is a fatal recipe
p71
aVthat will destroy the banks
p72
aVas well as the economy.
p73
aVAnd it also turns out to be precisely
p74
aVwhat could have stopped this crisis,
p75
aVthe one that cost us 11 trillion dollars
p76
aVjust in the household sector,
p77
aVthat cost us 10 million jobs,
p78
aVwas the easiest financial crisis by far
p79
aVto have avoided completely
p80
aVif we had simply learned the lessons
p81
aVof epidemics of control fraud,
p82
aVparticularly using this recipe.
p83
aVSo let's go to this crisis,
p84
aVand the two huge epidemics
p85
aVof loan origination fraud that drove the crisis \u2014
p86
aVappraisal fraud and liar's loans \u2014
p87
aVand what we're going to see
p88
aVin looking at both of these is
p89
aVwe got warnings that were incredibly early
p90
aVabout these frauds.
p91
aVWe got warnings that we could have taken advantage of easily,
p92
aVbecause back in the savings and loan debacle,
p93
aVwe had figured out how to respond
p94
aVand prevent these crises.
p95
aVAnd three, the warnings were unambiguous.
p96
aVThey were obvious that what was going on
p97
aVwas an epidemic of accounting control fraud building up.
p98
aa(lp99
VLet's take appraisal fraud first.
p100
aVThis is simply where you inflate the value
p101
aVof the home that is being pledged
p102
aVas security for the loan.
p103
aVIn 2000, the year 2000,
p104
aVthat is over a year before Enron fails, by the way,
p105
aVthe honest appraisers got together a formal petition
p106
aVbegging the federal government to act,
p107
aVand the industry to act,
p108
aVto stop this epidemic of appraisal fraud.
p109
aVAnd the appraisers explained how it was occurring,
p110
aVthat banks were demanding that appraisers
p111
aVinflate the appraisal,
p112
aVand that if the appraisers refused to do so,
p113
aVthey, the banks, would blacklist
p114
aVhonest appraisers
p115
aVand refuse to use them.
p116
aVNow, we've seen this before
p117
aVin the savings and loan debacle,
p118
aVand we know that this kind of fraud
p119
aVcan only originate from the lenders,
p120
aVand that no honest lender would ever inflate
p121
aVthe appraisal,
p122
aVbecause it's the great protection against loss.
p123
aVSo this was an incredibly early warning, 2000.
p124
aVIt was something we'd seen before,
p125
aVand it was completely unambiguous.
p126
aVThis was an epidemic of accounting control fraud
p127
aVled by the banks.
p128
aa(lp129
VWhat about liar's loans?
p130
aVWell, that warning actually comes earlier.
p131
aVThe savings and loan debacle is basically
p132
aVthe early 1980s through 1993,
p133
aVand in the midst of fighting that wave
p134
aVof accounting control fraud,
p135
aVin 1990, we found that a second front
p136
aVof fraud was being started.
p137
aVAnd like all good financial frauds in America,
p138
aVit began in Orange County, California.
p139
aVAnd we happened to be the regional regulators for it.
p140
aVAnd our examiners said,
p141
aVthey are making loans without even checking
p142
aVwhat the borrower's income is.
p143
aVThis is insane, it has to lead to massive losses,
p144
aVand it only makes sense for entities engaged
p145
aVin these accounting control frauds.
p146
aVAnd we said, yeah, you're absolutely right,
p147
aVand we drove those liar's loans
p148
aVout of the industry in 1990 and 1991,
p149
aVbut we could only deal with the industry
p150
aVwe had jurisdiction over,
p151
aVwhich was savings and loans,
p152
aVand so the biggest and the baddest of the frauds,
p153
aVLong Beach Savings, voluntarily gave up
p154
aVits federal savings and loan charter,
p155
aVgave up federal deposit insurance,
p156
aVconverted to become a mortgage bank
p157
aVfor the sole purpose of escaping our jurisdiction,
p158
aVand changed its name to Ameriquest,
p159
aVand became the most notorious
p160
aVof the liar's loans frauds early on,
p161
aVand to add to that,
p162
aVthey deliberately predated upon minorities.
p163
aa(lp164
VSo we knew again about this crisis.
p165
aVWe'd seen it before. We'd stopped it before.
p166
aVWe had incredibly early warnings of it,
p167
aVand it was absolutely unambiguous
p168
aVthat no honest lender would make loans in this fashion.
p169
aVSo let's take a look at the reaction
p170
aVof the industry and the regulators
p171
aVand the prosecutors to these clear
p172
aVearly warnings that could have prevented the crisis.
p173
aa(lp174
VStart with the industry.
p175
aVThe industry responded between 2003 and 2006
p176
aVby increasing liar's loans
p177
aVby over 500 percent.
p178
aVThese were the loans
p179
aVthat hyperinflated the bubble
p180
aVand produced the economic crisis.
p181
aVBy 2006, half of all the loans called subprime
p182
aVwere also liar's loans.
p183
aVThey're not mutually exclusive, it's just that together,
p184
aVthey're the most toxic combination
p185
aVyou can possibly imagine.
p186
aVBy 2006, 40 percent of all the loans
p187
aVmade that year, all the home loans made that year,
p188
aVwere liar's loans,
p189
aV40 percent.
p190
aVAnd this is despite a warning
p191
aVfrom the industry's own antifraud experts
p192
aVthat said that these loans were an open invitation
p193
aVto fraudsters,
p194
aVand that they had a fraud incidence
p195
aVof 90 percent,
p196
aVnine zero.
p197
aVIn response to that, the industry
p198
aVfirst started calling these loans liar's loans,
p199
aVwhich lacks a certain subtlety,
p200
aVand second, massively increased them,
p201
aVand no government regulator ever
p202
aVrequired or encouraged any lender
p203
aVto make a liar's loan
p204
aVor anyone to purchase a liar's loan,
p205
aVand that explicitly includes Fannie and Freddie.
p206
aVThis came from the lenders
p207
aVbecause of the fraud recipe.
p208
aa(lp209
VWhat happened to appraisal fraud?
p210
aVIt expanded remarkably as well.
p211
aVBy 2007, when a survey of appraisers was done,
p212
aV90 percent of appraisers reported
p213
aVthat they had been subject to coercion
p214
aVfrom the lenders trying to get them
p215
aVto inflate an appraisal.
p216
aVIn other words, both forms of fraud
p217
aVbecame absolutely endemic and normal,
p218
aVand this is what drove the bubble.
p219
aa(lp220
VWhat happened in the governmental sector?
p221
aVWell, the government, as I told you,
p222
aVwhen we were the savings and loan regulators,
p223
aVwe could only deal with our industry,
p224
aVand if people gave up their federal deposit insurance,
p225
aVwe couldn't do anything to them.
p226
aVCongress, it may strike you as impossible,
p227
aVbut actually did something intelligent in 1994,
p228
aVand passed the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act
p229
aVthat gave the Fed, and only the Federal Reserve,
p230
aVthe explicit, statutory authority to ban liar's loans
p231
aVby every lender,
p232
aVwhether or not they had federal deposit insurance.
p233
aVSo what did Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan,
p234
aVas chairs of the Fed, do
p235
aVwhen they got these warnings
p236
aVthat these were massively fraudulent loans
p237
aVand that they were being sold to the secondary market?
p238
aVRemember, there's no fraud exorcist.
p239
aVOnce it starts out a fraudulent loan,
p240
aVit can only be sold to the secondary market
p241
aVthrough more frauds,
p242
aVlying about the reps and warrantees,
p243
aVand then those people are going to produce
p244
aVmortgage-backed securities
p245
aVand exotic derivatives
p246
aVwhich are also going to be supposedly backed
p247
aVby those fraudulent loans.
p248
aVSo the fraud is going to progress
p249
aVthrough the entire system,
p250
aVhyperinflate the bubble, produce a disaster.
p251
aVAnd remember, we had experience with this.
p252
aVWe had seen significant losses,
p253
aVand we had experience of competent regulators
p254
aVin stopping it.
p255
aVGreenspan and Bernanke refused
p256
aVto use the authority under the statute
p257
aVto stop liar's loans.
p258
aVAnd this was a matter first of dogma.
p259
aVThey're just horrifically opposed
p260
aVto anything regulatory.
p261
aVBut it is also the international competition in laxity,
p262
aVthe race to the bottom
p263
aVbetween the United States and the United Kingdom,
p264
aVthe city of London, in particular,
p265
aVand the city of London won that race to the bottom,
p266
aVbut it meant that all regulation in the West
p267
aVwas completely degraded
p268
aVin this stupid competition to be
p269
aVwho could have the weakest regulation.
p270
aa(lp271
VSo that was the regulatory response.
p272
aVWhat about the response of the prosecutors
p273
aVafter the crisis,
p274
aVafter 11 trillion dollars in losses,
p275
aVafter 10 million jobs lost,
p276
aVa crisis in which the losses and the frauds
p277
aVwere more than 70 times larger
p278
aVthan the savings and loan debacle?
p279
aVWell, in the savings and loan debacle,
p280
aVour agency that regulated savings and loans, OTS,
p281
aVmade over 30,000 criminal referrals,
p282
aVproduced over 1,000 felony convictions
p283
aVjust in cases designated as major,
p284
aVand that understates the degree of prioritization,
p285
aVbecause we worked with the FBI
p286
aVto create the list of the top 100 fraud schemes,
p287
aVthe absolute worst of the worst, nationwide.
p288
aVRoughly 300 savings and loans involved,
p289
aVroughly 600 senior officials.
p290
aVVirtually all of them were prosecuted.
p291
aVWe had a 90 percent conviction rate.
p292
aVIt's the greatest success against
p293
aVelite white collar criminals ever,
p294
aVand it was because of this understanding
p295
aVof control fraud
p296
aVand the accounting control fraud mechanism.
p297
aa(lp298
VFlash forward to the current crisis.
p299
aVThe same agency, Office of Thrift Supervision,
p300
aVwhich was supposed to regulate
p301
aVmany of the largest makers of liar's loans
p302
aVin the country,
p303
aVhas made, even today \u2014 it no longer exists,
p304
aVbut as of a year ago,
p305
aVit had made zero criminal referrals.
p306
aVThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
p307
aVwhich is supposed to regulate the largest national banks,
p308
aVhas made zero criminal referrals.
p309
aVThe Fed appears to have made
p310
aVzero criminal referrals.
p311
aVThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
p312
aVis smart enough to refuse to answer the question.
p313
aVWithout any guidance from the regulators,
p314
aVthere's no expertise in the FBI
p315
aVto investigate complex frauds.
p316
aVIt isn't simply that they've had
p317
aVto reinvent the wheel
p318
aVof how to do these prosecutions;
p319
aVthey've forgotten that the wheel exists,
p320
aVand therefore, we have zero prosecutions,
p321
aVand of course, zero convictions,
p322
aVof any of the elite bank frauds,
p323
aVthe Wall Street types,
p324
aVthat drove this crisis.
p325
aa(lp326
VWith no expertise coming from the regulators,
p327
aVthe FBI formed what it calls a partnership
p328
aVwith the Mortgage Bankers Association in 2007.
p329
aVThe Mortgage Bankers Association
p330
aVis the trade association of the perps.
p331
aVAnd the Mortgage Bankers Association
p332
aVset out, it had the audacity and the success
p333
aVto con the FBI.
p334
aVIt had created a supposed definition
p335
aVof mortgage fraud, in which, guess what,
p336
aVits members are always the victim
p337
aVand never the perpetrators.
p338
aVAnd the FBI has bought this hook, line, sinker,
p339
aVrod, reel and the boat they rode out in.
p340
aVAnd so the FBI,
p341
aVunder the leadership of an attorney general
p342
aVwho is African-American
p343
aVand a president of the United States who is African-American,
p344
aVhave adopted the Tea Party definition of the crisis,
p345
aVin which it is the first virgin crisis in history,
p346
aVconceived without sin in the executive ranks.
p347
aVAnd it's those oh-so-clever hairdressers
p348
aVwho were able to defraud the poor, pitiful banks,
p349
aVwho lack any financial sophistication.
p350
aVIt is the silliest story you can conceive of,
p351
aVand so they go and they prosecute the hairdressers,
p352
aVand they leave the banksters alone entirely.
p353
aVAnd so, while lions are roaming the campsite,
p354
aVthe FBI is chasing mice.
p355
aa(lp356
VWhat do we need to do?
p357
aVWhat can we do in all of this?
p358
aVWe need to change the perverse incentive structures
p359
aVthat produce these recurrent epidemics
p360
aVof accounting control fraud
p361
aVthat are driving our crises.
p362
aVSo we have to first get rid
p363
aVof the systemically dangerous institutions.
p364
aVThese are the so-called too-big-to-fail institutions.
p365
aVWe need to shrink them to the point,
p366
aVwithin the next five years,
p367
aVthat they no longer pose a systemic risk.
p368
aVRight now, they are ticking time bombs
p369
aVthat will cause a global crisis
p370
aVas soon as the next one fails \u2014
p371
aVnot if, when.
p372
aVSecond thing we need to do is completely reform
p373
aVmodern executive and professional compensation,
p374
aVwhich is what they use to suborn the appraisers.
p375
aVRemember, they were pressuring the appraisers
p376
aVthrough the compensation system,
p377
aVtrying to produce what we call a Gresham's dynamic,
p378
aVin which bad ethics drives good ethics
p379
aVout of the marketplace.
p380
aVAnd they largely succeeded,
p381
aVwhich is how the fraud became endemic.
p382
aVAnd the third thing that we need to do
p383
aVis deal with what we call the three D's:
p384
aVderegulation, desupervision,
p385
aVand the de facto decriminalization.
p386
aVBecause we can make
p387
aVall three of these changes, and if we do so,
p388
aVwe can dramatically reduce
p389
aVhow often we have a crisis
p390
aVand how severe those crises are.
p391
aVThat is not simply critical to our economy.
p392
aVYou can see what these crises do to inequality
p393
aVand what they do to our democracy.
p394
aVThey have produced crony capitalism,
p395
aVAmerican-style,
p396
aVin which the largest financial institutions
p397
aVare the leading financial donors of both parties,
p398
aVand that's the reason why
p399
aVeven after this crisis,
p400
aV70 times larger than the savings and loan crisis,
p401
aVwe have no meaningful reforms
p402
aVin any of the three areas that I've talked about,
p403
aVother than banning liar's loans,
p404
aVwhich is good,
p405
aVbut that's just one form of ammunition
p406
aVfor this fraud weapon.
p407
aVThere are many forms of ammunition they can use.
p408
aa(lp409
VThat's why we need to learn
p410
aVwhat the bankers have learned:
p411
aVthe recipe for the best way to rob a bank,
p412
aVso that we can stop that recipe,
p413
aVbecause our legislators,
p414
aVwho are dependent on political contributions,
p415
aVwill not do it on their own.
