VWe live in an incredibly busy world.
p4
aVThe pace of life is often frantic, our minds are always busy,
p5
aVand we're always doing something.
p6
aa(lp7
VSo with that in mind, I'd like you just to take a moment
p8
aVto think, when did you last take any time to do nothing?
p9
aVJust 10 minutes, undisturbed?
p10
aVAnd when I say nothing, I do mean nothing.
p11
aVSo that's no emailing, texting, no Internet,
p12
aVno TV, no chatting, no eating, no reading.
p13
aVNot even sitting there reminiscing about the past
p14
aVor planning for the future.
p15
aVSimply doing nothing.
p16
aVI see a lot of very blank faces.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VYou probably have to go a long way back.
p21
aa(lp22
VAnd this is an extraordinary thing, right?
p23
aVWe're talking about our mind.
p24
aVThe mind, our most valuable and precious resource,
p25
aVthrough which we experience every single moment of our life.
p26
aVThe mind that we rely upon
p27
aVto be happy, content, emotionally stable as individuals,
p28
aVand at the same time, to be kind and thoughtful
p29
aVand considerate in our relationships with others.
p30
aVThis is the same mind that we depend upon
p31
aVto be focused, creative, spontaneous,
p32
aVand to perform at our very best in everything that we do.
p33
aVAnd yet, we don't take any time out to look after it.
p34
aVIn fact, we spend more time looking after our cars,
p35
aVour clothes and our hair than we \u2014
p36
aVokay, maybe not our hair,
p37
aa(lp38
V(Laughter)
p39
aa(lp40
Vbut you see where I'm going.
p41
aa(lp42
VThe result, of course, is that we get stressed.
p43
aVYou know, the mind whizzes away like a washing machine
p44
aVgoing round and round, lots of difficult, confusing emotions,
p45
aVand we don't really know how to deal with that.
p46
aVAnd the sad fact is that we are so distracted
p47
aVthat we're no longer present in the world in which we live.
p48
aVWe miss out on the things that are most important to us,
p49
aVand the crazy thing is that everybody just assumes,
p50
aVthat's the way life is, so we've just kind of got to get on with it.
p51
aVThat's really not how it has to be.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo I was about 11 when I went along to my first meditation class.
p54
aVAnd trust me, it had all the stereotypes that you can imagine,
p55
aVthe sitting cross-legged on the floor,
p56
aVthe incense, the herbal tea, the vegetarians, the whole deal,
p57
aVbut my mom was going and I was intrigued, so I went along with her.
p58
aVI'd also seen a few kung fu movies,
p59
aVand secretly I kind of thought I might be able to learn how to fly,
p60
aVbut I was very young at the time.
p61
aVNow as I was there, I guess, like a lot of people,
p62
aVI assumed that it was just an aspirin for the mind.
p63
aVYou get stressed, you do some meditation.
p64
aVI hadn't really thought that it could be sort of preventative in nature,
p65
aVuntil I was about 20, when a number of things happened in my life
p66
aVin quite quick succession,
p67
aVreally serious things which just flipped my life upside down
p68
aVand all of a sudden I was inundated with thoughts,
p69
aVinundated with difficult emotions that I didn't know how to cope with.
p70
aVEvery time I sort of pushed one down,
p71
aVanother one would pop back up again.
p72
aVIt was a really very stressful time.
p73
aa(lp74
VI guess we all deal with stress in different ways.
p75
aVSome people will bury themselves in work, grateful for the distraction.
p76
aVOthers will turn to their friends, their family, looking for support.
p77
aVSome people hit the bottle, start taking medication.
p78
aVMy own way of dealing with it was to become a monk.
p79
aVSo I quit my degree, I headed off to the Himalayas,
p80
aVI became a monk, and I started studying meditation.
p81
aa(lp82
VPeople often ask me what I learned from that time.
p83
aVWell, obviously it changed things.
p84
aVLet's face it, becoming a celibate monk is going to change a number of things.
p85
aVBut it was more than that.
p86
aVIt taught me \u2014 it gave me a greater appreciation,
p87
aVan understanding for the present moment.
p88
aVBy that I mean not being lost in thought,
p89
aVnot being distracted,
p90
aVnot being overwhelmed by difficult emotions,
p91
aVbut instead learning how to be in the here and now,
p92
aVhow to be mindful, how to be present.
p93
aa(lp94
VI think the present moment is so underrated.
p95
aVIt sounds so ordinary,
p96
aVand yet we spend so little time in the present moment
p97
aVthat it's anything but ordinary.
p98
aVThere was a research paper that came out of Harvard, just recently,
p99
aVthat said on average, our minds are lost in thought
p100
aValmost 47 percent of the time.
p101
aV47 percent.
p102
aVAt the same time, this sort of constant mind-wandering
p103
aVis also a direct cause of unhappiness.
p104
aVNow we're not here for that long anyway,
p105
aVbut to spend almost half of our life lost in thought
p106
aVand potentially quite unhappy,
p107
aVI don't know, it just kind of seems tragic, actually,
p108
aVespecially when there's something we can do about it,
p109
aVwhen there's a positive, practical, achievable,
p110
aVscientifically proven technique
p111
aVwhich allows our mind to be more healthy,
p112
aVto be more mindful and less distracted.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd the beauty of it is that even though
p115
aVit need only take about 10 minutes a day,
p116
aVit impacts our entire life.
p117
aVBut we need to know how to do it.
p118
aVWe need an exercise.
p119
aVWe need a framework to learn how to be more mindful.
p120
aVThat's essentially what meditation is.
p121
aVIt's familiarizing ourselves with the present moment.
p122
aVBut we also need to know how to approach it in the right way
p123
aVto get the best from it.
p124
aVAnd that's what these are for, in case you've been wondering,
p125
aVbecause most people assume
p126
aVthat meditation is all about stopping thoughts,
p127
aVgetting rid of emotions, somehow controlling the mind,
p128
aVbut actually it's quite different from that.
p129
aVIt's more about stepping back,
p130
aVsort of seeing the thought clearly,
p131
aVwitnessing it coming and going, emotions coming and going
p132
aVwithout judgment, but with a relaxed, focused mind.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo for example, right now,
p135
aVif I focus too much on the balls,
p136
aVthen there's no way I can relax and talk to you at the same time.
p137
aVEqually, if I relax too much talking to you,
p138
aVthere's no way I can focus on the balls.
p139
aVI'm going to drop them.
p140
aVNow in life, and in meditation,
p141
aVthere'll be times when the focus becomes a little bit too intense,
p142
aVand life starts to feel a bit like this.
p143
aVIt's a very uncomfortable way to live life,
p144
aVwhen you get this tight and stressed.
p145
aVAt other times, we might take our foot off the gas a little bit too much,
p146
aVand things just become a sort of little bit like this.
p147
aVOf course in meditation \u2014
p148
aa(lp149
V(Snores)
p150
aa(lp151
Vwe're going to end up falling asleep.
p152
aVSo we're looking for a balance, a focused relaxation
p153
aVwhere we can allow thoughts to come and go
p154
aVwithout all the usual involvement.
p155
aa(lp156
VNow, what usually happens when we're learning to be mindful
p157
aVis that we get distracted by a thought.
p158
aVLet's say this is an anxious thought.
p159
aVEverything's going fine, and we see the anxious thought.
p160
aV"Oh, I didn't realize I was worried about that."
p161
aVYou go back to it, repeat it.
p162
aV"Oh, I am worried.
p163
aVI really am worried. Wow, there's so much anxiety."
p164
aVAnd before we know it, right,
p165
aVwe're anxious about feeling anxious.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VYou know, this is crazy.
p170
aVWe do this all the time, even on an everyday level.
p171
aVIf you think about the last time you had a wobbly tooth.
p172
aVYou know it's wobbly, and you know that it hurts.
p173
aVBut what do you do every 20, 30 seconds?
p174
aa(lp175
V(Mumbling)
p176
aa(lp177
VIt does hurt.
p178
aVAnd we reinforce the storyline, right?
p179
aVAnd we just keep telling ourselves, and we do it all the time.
p180
aVAnd it's only in learning to watch the mind in this way
p181
aVthat we can start to let go of those storylines and patterns of mind.
p182
aVBut when you sit down and you watch the mind in this way,
p183
aVyou might see many different patterns.
p184
aVYou might find a mind that's really restless and \u2014
p185
aVthe whole time.
p186
aVDon't be surprised if you feel a bit agitated in your body
p187
aVwhen you sit down to do nothing and your mind feels like that.
p188
aVYou might find a mind that's very dull
p189
aVand boring, and it's just, almost mechanical,
p190
aVit just seems it's as if you're getting up, going to work,
p191
aVeat, sleep, get up, work.
p192
aVOr it might just be that one little nagging thought
p193
aVthat just goes round and round your mind.
p194
aa(lp195
VWell, whatever it is,
p196
aVmeditation offers the opportunity, the potential to step back
p197
aVand to get a different perspective,
p198
aVto see that things aren't always as they appear.
p199
aVWe can't change every little thing that happens to us in life,
p200
aVbut we can change the way that we experience it.
p201
aVThat's the potential of meditation, of mindfulness.
p202
aVYou don't have to burn any incense,
p203
aVand you definitely don't have to sit on the floor.
p204
aVAll you need to do is to take 10 minutes out a day
p205
aVto step back, to familiarize yourself with the present moment
p206
aVso that you get to experience a greater sense
p207
aVof focus, calm and clarity in your life.
p208
