VWhen I think about dreams,
p4
aVlike many of you,
p5
aVI think about this picture.
p6
aVI was eight when I watched Neil Armstrong
p7
aVstep off the Lunar Module onto the surface of the Moon.
p8
aVI had never seen anything like it before,
p9
aVand I've never seen anything like it since.
p10
aa(lp11
VWe got to the Moon for one simple reason:
p12
aVJohn Kennedy committed us to a deadline.
p13
aVAnd in the absence of that deadline,
p14
aVwe would still be dreaming about it.
p15
aVLeonard Bernstein said two things are necessary for great achievement:
p16
aVa plan and not quite enough time.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VDeadlines and commitments
p21
aVare the great and fading lessons of Apollo.
p22
aVAnd they are what give the word "moonshot" its meaning.
p23
aVAnd our world is in desperate need of political leaders
p24
aVwilling to set bold deadlines
p25
aVfor the achievement of daring dreams on the scale of Apollo again.
p26
aa(lp27
VWhen I think about dreams,
p28
aVI think about the drag queens of LA and Stonewall
p29
aVand millions of other people risking everything
p30
aVto come out when that was really dangerous,
p31
aVand of this picture of the White House lit up in rainbow colors,
p32
aVyes \u2014
p33
aa(lp34
V(Applause) \u2014
p35
aa(lp36
Vcelebrating America's gay and lesbian citizens' right to marry.
p37
aVIt is a picture that in my wildest dreams I could never have imagined
p38
aVwhen I was 18
p39
aVand figuring out that I was gay
p40
aVand feeling estranged from my country
p41
aVand my dreams because of it.
p42
aa(lp43
VI think about this picture of my family
p44
aVthat I never dreamed I could ever have \u2014
p45
aa(lp46
V(Applause) \u2014
p47
aa(lp48
Vand of our children holding this headline
p49
aVI never dreamed could ever be printed about the Supreme Court ruling.
p50
aa(lp51
VWe need more of the courage of drag queens and astronauts.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
V(Applause)
p56
aa(lp57
VBut I want to talk about the need for us to dream
p58
aVin more than one dimension,
p59
aVbecause there was something about Apollo that I didn't know when I was 8,
p60
aVand something about organizing that the rainbow colors over.
p61
aVOf the 30 astronauts in the original Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs,
p62
aVonly seven marriages survived.
p63
aVThose iconic images of the astronauts bouncing on the Moon
p64
aVobscure the alcoholism and depression on Earth.
p65
aa(lp66
VThomas Merton, the Trappist monk,
p67
aVasked during the time of Apollo,
p68
aV"What can we gain by sailing to the moon
p69
aVif we are not able to cross the abyss that separates us from ourselves?"
p70
aVAnd what can we gain by the right to marry
p71
aVif we are not able to cross the acrimony
p72
aVand emotional distance that so often separates us from our love?
p73
aVAnd not just in marriage.
p74
aVI have seen the most hurtful, destructive,
p75
aVtragic infighting in LGBT and AIDS
p76
aVand breast cancer and non-profit activism,
p77
aVall in the name of love.
p78
aa(lp79
VThomas Merton also wrote about wars among saints
p80
aVand that "there is a pervasive form of contemporary violence
p81
aVto which the idealist most easily succumbs:
p82
aVactivism and overwork.
p83
aVThe frenzy of our activism neutralizes our work for peace.
p84
aVIt destroys our own inner capacity for peace."
p85
aVToo often our dreams become these compartmentalized fixations
p86
aVon some future
p87
aVthat destroy our ability to be present for our lives right now.
p88
aVOur dreams of a better life for some future humanity
p89
aVor some other humanity in another country
p90
aValienate us from the beautiful human beings sitting next to us
p91
aVat this very moment.
p92
aa(lp93
VWell, that's just the price of progress, we say.
p94
aVYou can go to the Moon
p95
aVor you can have stability in your family life.
p96
aVAnd we can't conceive of dreaming in both dimensions at the same time.
p97
aVAnd we don't set the bar much higher than stability
p98
aVwhen it comes to our emotional life.
p99
aVWhich is why our technology for talking to one another
p100
aVhas gone vertical,
p101
aVour ability to listen and understand one another
p102
aVhas gone nowhere.
p103
aVOur access to information is through the roof,
p104
aVour access to joy, grounded.
p105
aVBut this idea, that our present and our future are mutually exclusive,
p106
aVthat to fulfill our potential for doing we have to surrender
p107
aVour profound potential for being,
p108
aVthat the number of transistors on a circuit can be doubled and doubled,
p109
aVbut our capacity for compassion and humanity and serenity and love
p110
aVis somehow limited
p111
aVis a false and suffocating choice.
p112
aa(lp113
VNow, I'm not suggesting
p114
aVsimply the uninspiring idea of more work-life balance.
p115
aVWhat good is it for me to spend more time with my kids at home
p116
aVif my mind is always somewhere else while I'm doing it?
p117
aVI'm not even talking about mindfulness.
p118
aVMindfulness is all of a sudden becoming a tool for improving productivity.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VRight?
p123
aa(lp124
VI'm talking about dreaming
p125
aVas boldly in the dimension of our being
p126
aVas we do about industry and technology.
p127
aVI'm talking about an audacious authenticity
p128
aVthat allows us to cry with one another,
p129
aVa heroic humility that allows us to remove our masks and be real.
p130
aVIt is our inability to be with one another,
p131
aVour fear of crying with one another, that gives rise to so many
p132
aVof the problems we are frantically trying to solve in the first place,
p133
aVfrom Congressional gridlock to economic inhumanity.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Applause)
p136
aa(lp137
VI'm talking about what Jonas Salk called an Epoch B,
p138
aVa new epoch in which we become as excited about and curious about
p139
aVand scientific about the development of our humanity
p140
aVas we are about the development of our technology.
p141
aa(lp142
VWe should not shrink from this opportunity
p143
aVsimply because we don't really understand it.
p144
aVThere was a time when we didn't understand space.
p145
aVOr because we're more used to technology and activism.
p146
aVThat is the very definition of being stuck in a comfort zone.
p147
aVWe are now very comfortable imagining unimaginable technological achievement.
p148
aVIn 2016, it is the dimension of our being itself
p149
aVthat cries out for its fair share of our imagination.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow, we're all here to dream,
p152
aVbut maybe if we're honest about it,
p153
aVeach of us chasing our own dream.
p154
aVYou know, looking at the name tags to see who can help me with my dream,
p155
aVsometimes looking right through one another's humanity.
p156
aVI can't be bothered with you right now. I have an idea for saving the world.
p157
aVRight?
p158
aa(lp159
V(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VYears ago, once upon a time, I had this beautiful company
p162
aVthat created these long journeys for heroic civic engagement.
p163
aVAnd we had this mantra:
p164
aV"Human. Kind. Be Both."
p165
aVAnd we encouraged people to experiment outrageously with kindness.
p166
aVLike, "Go help everybody set up their tents."
p167
aVAnd there were a lot of tents.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
V"Go buy everybody Popsicles."
p172
aV"Go help people fix their flat tires
p173
aVeven though you know the dinner line is going to get longer."
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd people really took us up on this,
p176
aVso much so that if you got a flat tire on the AIDS ride,
p177
aVyou had trouble fixing it, because there were so many people there asking you
p178
aVif you needed help.
p179
aa(lp180
VFor a few days, for tens of thousands of people,
p181
aVwe created these worlds
p182
aVthat everybody said were the way they wish the world could always be.
p183
aVWhat if we experimented with creating that kind of world
p184
aVthese next few days?
p185
aVAnd instead of going up to someone and asking them, "What do you do?"
p186
aVask them, "So what are your dreams?"
p187
aVor "What are your broken dreams?"
p188
aVYou know, "TED." Tend to Each other's Dreams.
p189
aa(lp190
V(Applause)
p191
aa(lp192
VMaybe it's "I want to stay sober"
p193
aVor "I want to build a tree house with my kid."
p194
aVYou know, instead of going up to the person everybody wants to meet,
p195
aVgo up to the person who is all alone
p196
aVand ask them if they want to grab a cup of coffee.
p197
aa(lp198
VI think what we fear most
p199
aVis that we will be denied the opportunity to fulfill our true potential,
p200
aVthat we are born to dream
p201
aVand we might die without ever having the chance.
p202
aa(lp203
VImagine living in a world
p204
aVwhere we simply recognize that deep, existential fear in one another
p205
aVand love one another boldly because we know
p206
aVthat to be human is to live with that fear.
p207
aVIt's time for us to dream in multiple dimensions simultaneously,
p208
aVand somewhere that transcends all of the wondrous things
p209
aVwe can and will and must do
p210
aVlies the domain of all the unbelievable things we could be.
p211
aa(lp212
VIt's time we set foot into that dimension
p213
aVand came out about the fact that we have dreams there, too.
p214
aVIf the Moon could dream,
p215
aVI think that would be its dream for us.
p216
aVIt's an honor to be with you.
p217
aa(lp218
VThank you very much.
