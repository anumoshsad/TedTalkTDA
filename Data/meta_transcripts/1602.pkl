VGood morning. So magic is an excellent way
p4
aVfor staying ahead of the reality curve,
p5
aVto make possible today
p6
aVwhat science will make a reality tomorrow.
p7
aVAs a cyber-magician, I combine elements of illusion
p8
aVand science to give us a feel of how future technologies
p9
aVmight be experienced.
p10
aa(lp11
VYou've probably all heard of Google's Project Glass.
p12
aVIt's new technology. You look through them
p13
aVand the world you see is augmented with data:
p14
aVnames of places, monuments, buildings,
p15
aVmaybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street.
p16
aVSo these are my illusion glasses.
p17
aVThey're a little bigger. They're a prototype.
p18
aVAnd when you look through them, you get a glimpse
p19
aVinto the mind of the cyber-illusionist.
p20
aa(lp21
VLet me show you what I mean.
p22
aVAll we need is a playing card. Any card will do.
p23
aVLike this. And let me mark it so we can recognize it
p24
aVwhen we see it again.
p25
aVAll right. Very significant mark.
p26
aVAnd let's put it back into the deck,
p27
aVsomewhere in the middle, and let's get started.
p28

p30
aa(lp31
VVoice: System ready. Acquiring image.

aa(lp33
VMarco Tempest: For those of you who don't play cards,
p34
aVa deck of cards is made up of four different suits:
p35
aVhearts, clubs,
p36
aVdiamonds and spades.
p37
aVThe cards are amongst the oldest of symbols,
p38
aVand have been interpreted in many different ways.
p39
aVNow, some say that the four suits
p40
aVrepresent the four seasons.
p41
aVThere's spring, summer,
p42
aVautumn and â€”
p43
aa(lp44
VVoice: My favorite season is winter.MT: Well yeah, mine too.
p45
aVWinter is like magic. It's a time of change,
p46
aVwhen warmth turns to cold, water turns to snow,
p47
aVand then it all disappears.
p48
aVThere are 13 cards in each suit. (Music)
p49
aa(lp50
VVoice: Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles.
p51
aa(lp52
VMT: So over here is low tide,
p53
aVand over here is high tide,
p54
aVand in the middle is the moon.
p55
aa(lp56
VVoice: The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic.
p57
aa(lp58
VMT: There are two colors in a deck of cards.
p59
aVThere is the color red
p60
aVand the color black,
p61
aVrepresenting the constant change
p62
aVfrom day to night.
p63
aa(lp64
VVoice: Marco, I did not know you could do that. (Laughter)
p65
aa(lp66
VMT: And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards
p67
aVin a deck of cards, just as there are 52 weeks in a year?
p68
aa(lp69
V(Music)
p70
aa(lp71
VVoice: If you total all the spots on a deck of cards,
p72
aVthe result is 365.
p73
aa(lp74
VMT: Oh, 365, the number of days in a year,
p75
aVthe number of days between
p76
aVeach birthday.
p77
aVMake a wish. (Blowing noise)
p78
aa(lp79
VVoice: Don't tell, or it won't come true.
p80
aa(lp81
VMT: Well, as a matter of fact, it was on my sixth birthday
p82
aVthat I received my first deck of cards,
p83
aVand ever since that day, I have traveled around the world
p84
aVperforming magic for boys and girls,
p85
aVmen and women, husbands and wives,
p86
aVeven kings and queens. (Applause)
p87
aa(lp88
VVoice: And who are these?MT: Ah, mischief-makers. Watch.
p89
aVWake up.
p90
aa(lp91
VJoker: Whoa.MT: Are you ready for your party piece?
p92
aa(lp93
VJoker: Ready!MT: Let me see what you've got.
p94
aa(lp95
VJoker: Presenting my pogo stick.MT: Ah. Watch out.
p96
aa(lp97
VJoker: Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh! (Music)
p98
aa(lp99
VMT: But today, I am performing for a different kind of audience.
p100
aVI'm performing for you.
p101
aa(lp102
VVoice: Signed card detected.MT: Well, sometimes people ask me
p103
aVhow do you become a magician? Is it a 9-to-5 job?
p104
aVOf course not! You've got to practice 24/7.
p105
aVI don't literally mean 24 hours, seven days a week.
p106
aV24/7 is a little bit of an exaggeration,
p107
aVbut it does take practice. Now, some people will say,
p108
aVwell, magic, that must be the work of some evil
p109
aVsupernatural force. (Laughter) (Applause)
p110
aa(lp111
V(Music)
p112
aa(lp113
VWhoa.
p114
aVWell, to this, I just say, no no.
p115
aVActually, in German, it's nein nein. (Laughter)
p116
aVMagic isn't that intense. I have to warn you, though,
p117
aVif you ever play with someone who deals cards like this,
p118
aVdon't play for money.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Music)
p121
aa(lp122
VVoice: Why not? That's a very good hand.
p123
aVThe odds of getting it are 4,165 to one.
p124
aa(lp125
VMT: Yeah, but I guess my hand is better. We beat the odds.
p126
aa(lp127
VVoice: I think you got your birthday wish.MT: And that actually leaves me with the last,
p128
aVand most important card of all:
p129
aVthe one with this very significant mark on it.
p130
aVAnd unlike anything else we've just seen,
p131
aVvirtual or not.Voice: Signed card detected.
p132
aa(lp133
VDigital MT: This is without a question the real thing.
p134
