VSo, 120 years ago,
p4
aVDr. Röntgen X-rayed his wife's hand.
p5
aVQuite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor
p6
aVwith her brooch, I'm not sure. It seems a bit extreme to me.
p7
aVThat image was the start of the X-ray technology.
p8
aVAnd I'm still fundamentally using the same principles today.
p9
aVI'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner.
p10
aa(lp11
VThe first shot I ever did
p12
aVwas of a soda can, which was to promote a brand that we all know,
p13
aVso I'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it.
p14
aVBut the second shot I did was my shoes I was wearing on the day.
p15
aVAnd I do really like this shot, because
p16
aVit shows all the detritus that's sort of embedded
p17
aVin the sole of the sneakers.
p18
aVIt was just one of those pot-luck things where you
p19
aVget it right first time.
p20
aa(lp21
VMoving on to something a bit larger,
p22
aVthis is an X-ray of a bus.
p23
aVAnd the bus is full of people.
p24
aVIt's actually the same person. It's just one skeleton.
p25
aVAnd back in the '60s,
p26
aVthey used to teach student radiographers
p27
aVto take X-rays, thankfully not on you and I,
p28
aVbut on dead people.
p29
aVSo, I've still got access to one of these dead people
p30
aVcalled Frieda; she's falling apart, I'm afraid,
p31
aVbecause she's very old and fragile.
p32
aVBut everyone on that bus is Frieda.
p33
aVAnd the bus is taken with a cargo-scanning X-ray,
p34
aVwhich is the sort of machine you have on borders,
p35
aVwhich checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things.
p36
aa(lp37
VFairly obvious what that is.
p38
aVSo, using large-scale objects
p39
aVdoes sort of create drama
p40
aVbecause you just don't see X-rays of big things that often.
p41
aVTechnology is moving ahead,
p42
aVand these large cargo scanner X-rays
p43
aVthat work with the digital system are getting better and better and better.
p44
aVAgain though, to make it come alive
p45
aVyou need, somehow, to add the human element.
p46
aVAnd I think the reason this image works, again, is because
p47
aVFrieda is driving the bulldozer.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VQuite a difficult brief,
p51
aVmake a pair of men's pants look beautiful.
p52
aVBut I think the process, in itself, shows how exquisite they are.
p53
aVFashion \u2014 now, I'm sort of anti-fashion because I
p54
aVdon't show the surface, I show what's within.
p55
aVSo, the fashionistas don't really like me
p56
aVbecause it doesn't matter if Kate Moss is wearing it or if I'm wearing it,
p57
aVit looks the same.
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aVWe all look the same inside, believe me.
p60
aVThe creases in the material and the sort of nuances.
p61
aVAnd I show things for really what they are, what they're made of.
p62
aVI peel back the layers and expose it.
p63
aVAnd if it's well made I show it, if it's badly made I show it.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd I'm sure Ross can associate that with design.
p66
aVThe design comes from within.
p67
aVIt's not just Topshop,
p68
aVI get some strange looks when I go out getting my props.
p69
aVHere I was fumbling around in the ladies' underwear department
p70
aVof a department store, almost got escorted from the premises.
p71
aVI live opposite a farm. And this was the runt of the litter, a piglet that died.
p72
aVAnd what's really interesting is,
p73
aVif you look at the legs, you'll notice that the bones haven't fused.
p74
aVAnd should that pig have grown,
p75
aVunfortunately it was dead, it would have certainly been dead
p76
aVafter I X-rayed it, with the amount of radiation I used anyway.
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aVBut once the bones had fused together
p79
aVit would have been healthy.
p80
aa(lp81
VSo, that's an empty parka jacket.
p82
aVBut I quite love the way it's posed.
p83
aVNature is my greatest inspiration.
p84
aVAnd to carry on with a theme that we've already touched with
p85
aVis how nature is related to architecture.
p86
aVIf you look at the roof of the Eden Project,
p87
aVor the British library, it's all this honeycomb structure.
p88
aVAnd I'm sure those architects are inspired,
p89
aVas I am, by what surrounds us, by nature.
p90
aVThis, in fact, is a Victoria water lily leaf
p91
aVthat floats on the top of a pond.
p92
aVAn amaryllis flower looking really three-dimensional.
p93
aVSeaweed, ebbing in the tide.
p94
aVNow, how do I do this, and where do I do this, and all of that sort of thing.
p95
aa(lp96
VThis is my new, purpose-built, X-ray shed.
p97
aVAnd the door to my X-ray room
p98
aVis made of lead and steel.
p99
aVIt weighs 1,250 kilograms and the only exercise I get is opening and closing it.
p100
aV(Laughter)
p101
aVThe walls are 700 millimeters thick of solid dense concrete.
p102
aVSo, I'm using quite a lot of radiation.
p103
aVA lot more than you'd get in a hospital or a vet's.
p104
aVAnd there I am. This is a quite high-powered X-ray machine.
p105
aVWhat's interesting really about X-ray really
p106
aVis, if you think about it, is that that technology
p107
aVis used for looking for cancer or looking for drugs,
p108
aVor looking for contraband or whatever.
p109
aVAnd I use that sort of technology
p110
aVto create things that are quite beautiful.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo, still working with film, I'm afraid.
p113
aVTechnology in X-ray where it's life-size processed,
p114
aVapart from these large cargo-scanning machines,
p115
aVhasn't moved on enough for the quality of the image
p116
aVand the resolution to be good enough for what I want to do with it,
p117
aVwhich is show my pictures big.
p118
aVSo, I have to use a 1980s drum scanner,
p119
aVwhich was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film.
p120
aVThey scan each individual X-ray.
p121
aVAnd this shows how I do my process of same-size X-rays.
p122
aVSo, this is, again, my daughter's dress.
p123
aVStill has the tag in it from me buying it,
p124
aVso I can take it back to the shop if she didn't like it.
p125
aVBut there are four X-ray plates.
p126
aVYou can see them overlapping.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo, when you move forward from something fairly small,
p129
aVa dress which is this size,
p130
aVonto something like that which is done in exactly the same process,
p131
aVyou can see that that is a lot of work.
p132
aVIn fact, that is three months solid X-raying.
p133
aVThere is over 500 separate components.
p134
aVBoeing sent me a 747 in containers.
p135
aVAnd I sent them back an X-ray.
p136
aV(Laughter) I kid you not.
p137
aa(lp138
VOkay, so Frieda is my dead skeleton.
p139
aVThis, unfortunately, is basically two pictures.
p140
aVOne on the extreme right is a photograph of an American footballer.
p141
aVThe one on the left is an x-ray.
p142
aVBut this time I had to use a real body.
p143
aVBecause I needed all the skin tissue to make it look real,
p144
aVto make it look like it was a real athlete.
p145
aVSo, here I had to use a recently deceased body.
p146
aVAnd getting a hold of that was extremely difficult and laborious.
p147
aVBut people do donate their bodies to art and science.
p148
aVAnd when they do, I'm in the queue.
p149
aVSo, I like to use them.
p150
aV(Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VThe coloring, so coloring adds another level to the X-rays.
p153
aVIt makes it more organic, more natural.
p154
aVIt's whatever takes my fancy, really.
p155
aVIt's not accurately colored to how it is in real life.
p156
aVThat flower doesn't come in bright orange, I don't think.
p157
aVBut I just like it in bright orange.
p158
aVAnd also with something technical, like these are DJ decks,
p159
aVit sort of adds another level.
p160
aVIt makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional.
p161
aa(lp162
VThe most difficult things to X-ray,
p163
aVthe most technically challenging things to X-ray
p164
aVare the lightest things, the most delicate things.
p165
aVTo get the detail in a feather,
p166
aVbelieve me, if there is anyone out here who knows anything about X-rays,
p167
aVthat's quite a challenge.
p168
aVI'm now going to show you a short film, I'll step to the side.
p169
aa(lp170
VVideo: (Music)
p171
aVThe thing in there is very dangerous.
p172
aVIf you touch that, you could possibly die
p173
aVthrough radiation poisoning.
p174
aVIn my career I've had two exposures to radiation,
p175
aVwhich is two too many, because it stays with you for life.
p176
aVIt's cumulative.
p177
aa(lp178
V(Music)
p179
aVIt has human connotations.
p180
aVThe fact that it's a child's toy that we all recognize,
p181
aVbut also it looks like it's a robot,
p182
aVand it comes from a sci-fi genus.
p183
aVIt's a surprise that it has humanity,
p184
aVbut also man-made, future, alien associations.
p185
aVAnd it's just a bit spooky.
p186
aa(lp187
V(Music)
p188
aVThe bus was done with a cargo-scanning X-ray machine,
p189
aVwhich is used on the borders
p190
aVbetween countries, looking for contraband and illegal immigrants.
p191
aVThe lorry goes in front of it. And it takes slices
p192
aVof X-rays through the lorry.
p193
aVAnd that's how this was done. It's actually slice, slice.
p194
aVIt's a bit like a CT scanner in a hospital. Slices.
p195
aVAnd then if you look carefully, there is all little things.
p196
aVHe's got headphones on, reading the newspaper,
p197
aVgot a hat on, glasses, got a bag.
p198
aVSo, these little details
p199
aVhelp to make it work, make it real.
p200
aa(lp201
V(Music)
p202
aVThe problem with using living people is that
p203
aVto take an X-ray, if I X-ray you, you get exposed to radiation.
p204
aVSo, to avoid that \u2014
p205
aVI have to avoid it somehow \u2014
p206
aVis I use dead people.
p207
aVNow, that's a variety of things, from recently deceased bodies,
p208
aVto a skeleton that was used by student radiographers
p209
aVto train in taking X-rays of the human body,
p210
aVat different densities.
p211
aa(lp212
V(Music)
p213
aVI have very high-tech equipment of gloves, scissors and a bucket.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Music)
p216
aVI will show how the capillary action works, how it feeds,
p217
aVI'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem.
p218
aVBecause it transfers food from its roots to its leaves.
p219
aVLook at this monster.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Music)
p222
aVIt's so basic. It just grows wild.
p223
aVThat's what I really like about it,
p224
aVthe fact that I haven't got to go and buy it,
p225
aVand it hasn't been genetically modified at all.
p226
aVIt's just happening.
p227
aVAnd the X-ray shows how beautiful nature can be.
p228
aVNot that that is particularly beautiful
p229
aVwhen you look at it with the human eye,
p230
aVthe way the leaves form. They're curling back on each other.
p231
aVSo the X-ray will show the overlaps in these little corners.
p232
aVThe thicker the object, the more radiation it needs,
p233
aVand the more time it needs.
p234
aVThe lighter the object, the less radiation.
p235
aVSometimes you keep the time up, because the time gives you detail.
p236
aVThe longer the exposure goes on for,
p237
aVthe more detail you get.
p238
aa(lp239
V(Music)
p240
aVIf you look at this, just the tube,
p241
aVit is quite bright.
p242
aVBut I could get a bit darker in the tube, but everything else would suffer.
p243
aVSo, these leaves at the edge would start to disappear.
p244
aVWhat I like is how hard the edges are,
p245
aVhow sharp.
p246
aVYeah, I'm quite pleased with it.
p247
aa(lp248
V(Music)
p249
aVI travel beyond the surface and show
p250
aVsomething for what it's worth,
p251
aVfor what it's really made of, how it really works.
p252
aVBut also I find that
p253
aVI've got the benefit of taking away all the surface,
p254
aVwhich is things that people are used to seeing.
p255
aa(lp256
VAnd that's the sort of thing I've been doing.
p257
aVI've got the opportunity now to show you
p258
aVwhat I'm going to be doing in the future.
p259
aVThis is a commercial application of my most recent work.
p260
aVAnd what's good about this, I think, is that it's like a moment in time,
p261
aVlike you've turned around, you've got X-ray vision
p262
aVand you've taken a picture with the X-ray camera.
p263
aVUnfortunately I haven't got X-ray vision.
p264
aVI do dream in X-ray. I see my projects in my sleep.
p265
aVAnd I know what they're going to look like in X-ray and I'm not far off.
p266
aa(lp267
VSo, what am I doing in the future?
p268
aVWell, this year is the 50th anniversary
p269
aVof Issigonis's Mini, which is one of my favorite cars.
p270
aVSo, I've taken it apart, component by component,
p271
aVmonths and months and months of work.
p272
aVAnd with this image, I'm going to be displaying
p273
aVit in the Victoria and Albert Museum
p274
aVas a light box, which is actually attached to the car.
p275
aVSo, I've got to saw the car in half, down the middle,
p276
aVnot an easy task, in itself.
p277
aVAnd then, so you can get in the driver's side, sit down,
p278
aVand up against you is a wall.
p279
aVAnd if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car,
p280
aVyou see a life-sized light box of the car showing you how it works.
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd I'm going to take that idea
p283
aVand apply it to other sort of iconic things from my life.
p284
aVLike, my first computer was a big movement in my life.
p285
aVAnd I had a Mac Classic. And it's a little box.
p286
aVAnd I think that would look quite neat as an X-ray.
p287
aVI'm also looking to
p288
aVtake my work from the two-dimensional form
p289
aVto a more three-dimensional form.
p290
aVAnd this is quite a good way of doing it.
p291
aVI'm also working now with X-ray video.
p292
aVSo, if you can imagine, some of these flowers,
p293
aVand they're actually moving and growing
p294
aVand you can film that in X-ray, should be quite stunning.
p295
aVBut that's it. I'm done. Thank you very much.
