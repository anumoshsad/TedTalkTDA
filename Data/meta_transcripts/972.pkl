VI want to talk to you today about prosperity,
p4
aVabout our hopes
p5
aVfor a shared and lasting prosperity.
p6
aVAnd not just us,
p7
aVbut the two billion people worldwide
p8
aVwho are still chronically undernourished.
p9
aVAnd hope actually is at the heart of this.
p10
aVIn fact, the Latin word for hope
p11
aVis at the heart of the word prosperity.
p12
aV"Pro-speras," "speras," hope \u2014
p13
aVin accordance with our hopes and expectations.
p14
aVThe irony is, though,
p15
aVthat we have cashed-out prosperity
p16
aValmost literally in terms of money and economic growth.
p17
aVAnd we've grown our economies so much
p18
aVthat we now stand
p19
aVin a real danger
p20
aVof undermining hope \u2014
p21
aVrunning down resources, cutting down rainforests,
p22
aVspilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico,
p23
aVchanging the climate \u2014
p24
aVand the only thing that has actually
p25
aVremotely slowed down the relentless rise
p26
aVof carbon emissions over the last two to three decades
p27
aVis recession.
p28
aVAnd recession, of course,
p29
aVisn't exactly a recipe for hope either,
p30
aVas we're busy finding out.
p31
aVSo we're caught in a kind of trap.
p32
aVIt's a dilemma, a dilemma of growth.
p33
aVWe can't live with it; we can't live without it.
p34
aVTrash the system or crash the planet \u2014
p35
aVit's a tough choice; it isn't much of a choice.
p36
aVAnd our best avenue of escape from this actually
p37
aVis a kind of blind faith
p38
aVin our own cleverness and technology and efficiency
p39
aVand doing things more efficiently.
p40
aVNow I haven't got anything against efficiency.
p41
aVAnd I think we are a clever species sometimes.
p42
aVBut I think we should also just check the numbers,
p43
aVtake a reality check here.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo I want you to imagine a world,
p46
aVin 2050, of around nine billion people,
p47
aVall aspiring to Western incomes,
p48
aVWestern lifestyles.
p49
aVAnd I want to ask the question \u2014
p50
aVand we'll give them that two percent hike in income, in salary each year as well,
p51
aVbecause we believe in growth.
p52
aVAnd I want to ask the question:
p53
aVhow far and how fast would be have to move?
p54
aVHow clever would we have to be?
p55
aVHow much technology would we need in this world
p56
aVto deliver our carbon targets?
p57
aVAnd here in my chart \u2014
p58
aVon the left-hand side is where we are now.
p59
aVThis is the carbon intensity of economic growth
p60
aVin the economy at the moment.
p61
aVIt's around about 770 grams of carbon.
p62
aVIn the world I describe to you,
p63
aVwe have to be right over here at the right-hand side
p64
aVat six grams of carbon.
p65
aVIt's a 130-fold improvement,
p66
aVand that is 10 times further and faster
p67
aVthan anything we've ever achieved in industrial history.
p68
aVMaybe we can do it, maybe it's possible \u2014 who knows?
p69
aVMaybe we can even go further
p70
aVand get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere,
p71
aVwhich is what we're going to need to be doing
p72
aVby the end of the century.
p73
aVBut shouldn't we just check first
p74
aVthat the economic system that we have
p75
aVis remotely capable of delivering
p76
aVthis kind of improvement?
p77
aa(lp78
VSo I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics.
p79
aVIt's a bit complex, and I apologize for that.
p80
aVWhat I'll try and do, is I'll try and paraphrase it
p81
aVis sort of human terms.
p82
aVSo it looks a little bit like this.
p83
aVFirms produce goods for households \u2014 that's us \u2014
p84
aVand provide us with incomes,
p85
aVand that's even better, because we can spend those incomes
p86
aVon more goods and services.
p87
aVThat's called the circular flow of the economy.
p88
aVIt looks harmless enough.
p89
aVI just want to highlight one key feature of this system,
p90
aVwhich is the role of investment.
p91
aVNow investment constitutes
p92
aVonly about a fifth of the national income
p93
aVin most modern economies,
p94
aVbut it plays an absolutely vital role.
p95
aVAnd what it does essentially
p96
aVis to stimulate further consumption growth.
p97
aVIt does this in a couple of ways \u2014
p98
aVchasing productivity,
p99
aVwhich drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff.
p100
aVBut I want to concentrate
p101
aVon the role of investment
p102
aVin seeking out novelty,
p103
aVthe production and consumption of novelty.
p104
aVJoseph Schumpeter called this
p105
aV"the process of creative destruction."
p106
aVIt's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty,
p107
aVcontinually chasing expanding consumer markets,
p108
aVconsumer goods, new consumer goods.
p109
aa(lp110
VAnd this, this is where it gets interesting,
p111
aVbecause it turns out that human beings
p112
aVhave something of an appetite for novelty.
p113
aVWe love new stuff \u2014
p114
aVnew material stuff for sure \u2014
p115
aVbut also new ideas, new adventures,
p116
aVnew experiences.
p117
aVBut the materiality matters too,
p118
aVbecause in every society
p119
aVthat anthropologists have looked at,
p120
aVmaterial stuff
p121
aVoperates as a kind of language \u2014
p122
aVa language of goods,
p123
aVa symbolic language
p124
aVthat we use to tell each other stories \u2014
p125
aVstories, for example,
p126
aVabout how important we are.
p127
aVStatus-driven, conspicuous consumption
p128
aVthrives from the language
p129
aVof novelty.
p130
aVAnd here, all of a sudden,
p131
aVwe have a system
p132
aVthat is locking economic structure with social logic \u2014
p133
aVthe economic institutions, and who we are as people, locked together
p134
aVto drive an engine of growth.
p135
aVAnd this engine is not just economic value;
p136
aVit is pulling material resources
p137
aVrelentlessly through the system,
p138
aVdriven by our own insatiable appetites,
p139
aVdriven in fact by a sense of anxiety.
p140
aVAdam Smith, 200 years ago,
p141
aVspoke about our desire
p142
aVfor a life without shame.
p143
aVA life without shame:
p144
aVin his day, what that meant was a linen shirt,
p145
aVand today, well, you still need the shirt,
p146
aVbut you need the hybrid car,
p147
aVthe HDTV, two holidays a year in the sun,
p148
aVthe netbook and iPad, the list goes on \u2014
p149
aVan almost inexhaustible supply of goods,
p150
aVdriven by this anxiety.
p151
aVAnd even if we don't want them,
p152
aVwe need to buy them,
p153
aVbecause, if we don't buy them, the system crashes.
p154
aVAnd to stop it crashing
p155
aVover the last two to three decades,
p156
aVwe've expanded the money supply,
p157
aVexpanded credit and debt,
p158
aVso that people can keep buying stuff.
p159
aVAnd of course, that expansion was deeply implicated in the crisis.
p160
aa(lp161
VBut this \u2014 I just want to show you some data here.
p162
aVThis is what it looks like, essentially,
p163
aVthis credit and debt system, just for the U.K.
p164
aVThis was the last 15 years before the crash,
p165
aVand you can see there, consumer debt rose dramatically.
p166
aVIt was above the GDP for three years in a row
p167
aVjust before the crisis.
p168
aVAnd in the mean time, personal savings absolutely plummeted.
p169
aVThe savings ratio, net savings,
p170
aVwere below zero in the middle of 2008,
p171
aVjust before the crash.
p172
aVThis is people expanding debt, drawing down their savings,
p173
aVjust to stay in the game.
p174
aVThis is a strange, rather perverse, story,
p175
aVjust to put it in very simple terms.
p176
aVIt's a story about us, people,
p177
aVbeing persuaded
p178
aVto spend money we don't have
p179
aVon things we don't need
p180
aVto create impressions that won't last
p181
aVon people we don't care about.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
V(Applause)
p186
aa(lp187
VBut before we consign ourselves to despair,
p188
aVmaybe we should just go back and say, "Did we get this right?
p189
aVIs this really how people are?
p190
aVIs this really how economies behave?"
p191
aVAnd almost straightaway
p192
aVwe actually run up against a couple of anomalies.
p193
aVThe first one is in the crisis itself.
p194
aVIn the crisis, in the recession, what do people want to do?
p195
aVThey want to hunker down, they want to look to the future.
p196
aVThey want to spend less and save more.
p197
aVBut saving is exactly the wrong thing to do
p198
aVfrom the system point of view.
p199
aVKeynes called this the "paradox of thrift" \u2014
p200
aVsaving slows down recovery.
p201
aVAnd politicians call on us continually
p202
aVto draw down more debt,
p203
aVto draw down our own savings even further,
p204
aVjust so that we can get the show back on the road,
p205
aVso we can keep this growth-based economy going.
p206
aVIt's an anomaly,
p207
aVit's a place where the system actually is at odds
p208
aVwith who we are as people.
p209
aa(lp210
VHere's another one \u2014 completely different one:
p211
aVWhy is it
p212
aVthat we don't do the blindingly obvious things we should do
p213
aVto combat climate change,
p214
aVvery, very simple things
p215
aVlike buying energy-efficient appliances,
p216
aVputting in efficient lights, turning the lights off occasionally,
p217
aVinsulating our homes?
p218
aVThese things save carbon, they save energy,
p219
aVthey save us money.
p220
aVSo is it that, though they make perfect economic sense,
p221
aVwe don't do them?
p222
aVWell, I had my own personal insight into this
p223
aVa few years ago.
p224
aVIt was a Sunday evening, Sunday afternoon,
p225
aVand it was just after \u2014
p226
aVactually, to be honest, too long after \u2014
p227
aVwe had moved into a new house.
p228
aVAnd I had finally got around to doing some draft stripping,
p229
aVinstalling insulation around the windows and doors
p230
aVto keep out the drafts.
p231
aVAnd my, then, five year-old daughter
p232
aVwas helping me in the way that five year-olds do.
p233
aVAnd we'd been doing this for a while,
p234
aVwhen she turned to me very solemnly and said,
p235
aV"Will this really keep out the giraffes?"
p236
aV(Laughter)
p237
aV"Here they are, the giraffes."
p238
aVYou can hear the five-year-old mind working.
p239
aVThese ones, interestingly, are 400 miles north of here
p240
aVoutside Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria.
p241
aVGoodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather.
p242
aVBut actually that childish misrepresentation
p243
aVstuck with me,
p244
aVbecause it suddenly became clear to me
p245
aVwhy we don't do the blindingly obvious things.
p246
aVWe're too busy keeping out the giraffes \u2014
p247
aVputting the kids on the bus in the morning,
p248
aVgetting ourselves to work on time,
p249
aVsurviving email overload
p250
aVand shop floor politics,
p251
aVforaging for groceries, throwing together meals,
p252
aVescaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening
p253
aVinto prime-time TV
p254
aVor TED online,
p255
aVgetting from one end of the day to the other,
p256
aVkeeping out the giraffes.
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
VWhat is the objective?
p261
aV"What is the objective of the consumer?"
p262
aVMary Douglas asked in an essay on poverty
p263
aVwritten 35 years ago.
p264
aV"It is," she said,
p265
aV"to help create the social world
p266
aVand find a credible place in it."
p267
aVThat is a deeply humanizing
p268
aVvision of our lives,
p269
aVand it's a completely different vision
p270
aVthan the one that lies at the heart
p271
aVof this economic model.
p272
aVSo who are we?
p273
aVWho are these people?
p274
aVAre we these novelty-seeking, hedonistic,
p275
aVselfish individuals?
p276
aVOr might we actually occasionally be
p277
aVsomething like the selfless altruist
p278
aVdepicted in Rembrandt's lovely, lovely sketch here?
p279
aVWell psychology actually says
p280
aVthere is a tension \u2014
p281
aVa tension between self-regarding behaviors
p282
aVand other regarding behaviors.
p283
aVAnd these tensions have deep evolutionary roots,
p284
aVso selfish behavior
p285
aVis adaptive in certain circumstances \u2014
p286
aVfight or flight.
p287
aa(lp288
VBut other regarding behaviors
p289
aVare essential to our evolution
p290
aVas social beings.
p291
aVAnd perhaps even more interesting from our point of view,
p292
aVanother tension between novelty-seeking behaviors
p293
aVand tradition or conservation.
p294
aVNovelty is adaptive when things are changing
p295
aVand you need to adapt yourself.
p296
aVTradition is essential to lay down the stability
p297
aVto raise families and form cohesive social groups.
p298
aVSo here, all of a sudden,
p299
aVwe're looking at a map of the human heart.
p300
aVAnd it reveals to us, suddenly,
p301
aVthe crux of the matter.
p302
aVWhat we've done is we've created economies.
p303
aVWe've created systems,
p304
aVwhich systematically privilege, encourage,
p305
aVone narrow quadrant
p306
aVof the human soul
p307
aVand left the others unregarded.
p308
aVAnd in the same token, the solution becomes clear,
p309
aVbecause this isn't, therefore,
p310
aVabout changing human nature.
p311
aVIt isn't, in fact, about curtailing possibilities.
p312
aVIt is about opening up.
p313
aVIt is about allowing ourselves the freedom
p314
aVto become fully human,
p315
aVrecognizing the depth and the breadth
p316
aVof the human psyche
p317
aVand building institutions
p318
aVto protect Rembrandt's fragile altruist within.
p319
aa(lp320
VWhat does all this mean for economics?
p321
aVWhat would economies look like
p322
aVif we took that vision of human nature
p323
aVat their heart
p324
aVand stretched them
p325
aValong these orthogonal dimensions
p326
aVof the human psyche?
p327
aVWell, it might look a little bit
p328
aVlike the 4,000 community-interest companies
p329
aVthat have sprung up in the U.K. over the last five years
p330
aVand a similar rise in B corporations in the United States,
p331
aVenterprises
p332
aVthat have ecological and social goals
p333
aVwritten into their constitution
p334
aVat their heart \u2014
p335
aVcompanies, in fact, like this one, Ecosia.
p336
aVAnd I just want to, very quickly, show you this.
p337
aVEcosia is an Internet search engine.
p338
aVInternet search engines work
p339
aVby drawing revenues from sponsored links
p340
aVthat appear when you do a search.
p341
aVAnd Ecosia works in pretty much the same way.
p342
aVSo we can do that here \u2014
p343
aVwe can just put in a little search term.
p344
aVThere you go, Oxford, that's where we are. See what comes up.
p345
aVThe difference with Ecosia though
p346
aVis that, in Ecosia's case,
p347
aVit draws the revenues in the same way,
p348
aVbut it allocates
p349
aV80 percent of those revenues
p350
aVto a rainforest protection project in the Amazon.
p351
aVAnd we're going to do it.
p352
aVWe're just going to click on Naturejobs.uk.
p353
aVIn case anyone out there is looking for a job in a recession,
p354
aVthat's the page to go to.
p355
aVAnd what happened then was
p356
aVthe sponsor gave revenues to Ecosia,
p357
aVand Ecosia is giving 80 percent of those revenues
p358
aVto a rainforest protection project.
p359
aVIt's taking profits from one place
p360
aVand allocating them
p361
aVinto the protection of ecological resources.
p362
aa(lp363
VIt's a different kind of enterprise
p364
aVfor a new economy.
p365
aVIt's a form, if you like,
p366
aVof ecological altruism \u2014
p367
aVperhaps something along those lines. Maybe it's that.
p368
aVWhatever it is,
p369
aVwhatever this new economy is,
p370
aVwhat we need the economy to do, in fact,
p371
aVis to put investment
p372
aVback into the heart of the model,
p373
aVto re-conceive investment.
p374
aVOnly now, investment
p375
aVisn't going to be
p376
aVabout the relentless and mindless
p377
aVpursuit of consumption growth.
p378
aVInvestment has to be a different beast.
p379
aVInvestment has to be,
p380
aVin the new economy,
p381
aVprotecting and nurturing
p382
aVthe ecological assets on which our future depends.
p383
aVIt has to be about transition.
p384
aVIt has to be investing in low-carbon technologies
p385
aVand infrastructures.
p386
aVWe have to invest, in fact,
p387
aVin the idea of a meaningful prosperity,
p388
aVproviding capabilities
p389
aVfor people to flourish.
p390
aa(lp391
VAnd of course, this task has material dimensions.
p392
aVIt would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing
p393
aVif they didn't have food, clothing and shelter.
p394
aVBut it's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this.
p395
aVIt has social and psychological aims \u2014
p396
aVfamily, friendship,
p397
aVcommitments, society,
p398
aVparticipating in the life of that society.
p399
aVAnd this too
p400
aVrequires investment,
p401
aVinvestment \u2014 for example, in places \u2014
p402
aVplaces where we can connect,
p403
aVplaces where we can participate,
p404
aVshared spaces,
p405
aVconcert halls, gardens,
p406
aVpublic parks,
p407
aVlibraries, museums, quiet centers,
p408
aVplaces of joy and celebration,
p409
aVplaces of tranquility and contemplation,
p410
aVsites for the "cultivation
p411
aVof a common citizenship,"
p412
aVin Michael Sandel's lovely phrase.
p413
aVAn investment \u2014 investment, after all, is just such a basic economic concept \u2014
p414
aVis nothing more nor less
p415
aVthan a relationship
p416
aVbetween the present and the future,
p417
aVa shared present and a common future.
p418
aVAnd we need that relationship to reflect,
p419
aVto reclaim hope.
p420
aa(lp421
VSo let me come back, with this sense of hope,
p422
aVto the two billion people
p423
aVstill trying to live each day
p424
aVon less than the price of a skinny latte
p425
aVfrom the cafe next door.
p426
aVWhat can we offer those people?
p427
aVIt's clear that we have a responsibility
p428
aVto help lift them out of poverty.
p429
aVIt's clear that we have a responsibility
p430
aVto make room for growth
p431
aVwhere growth really matters in those poorest nations.
p432
aVAnd it's also clear that we will never achieve that
p433
aVunless we're capable of redefining
p434
aVa meaningful sense of prosperity in the richer nations,
p435
aVa prosperity that is more meaningful
p436
aVand less materialistic
p437
aVthan the growth-based model.
p438
aVSo this is not just
p439
aVa Western post-materialist fantasy.
p440
aVIn fact, an African philosopher wrote to me,
p441
aVwhen "Prosperity Without Growth" was published,
p442
aVpointing out the similarities
p443
aVbetween this view of prosperity
p444
aVand the traditional African concept of ubuntu.
p445
aVUbuntu says, "I am
p446
aVbecause we are."
p447
aVProsperity is a shared endeavor.
p448
aVIts roots are long and deep \u2014
p449
aVits foundations, I've tried to show,
p450
aVexist already, inside each of us.
p451
aVSo this is not about
p452
aVstanding in the way of development.
p453
aVIt's not about
p454
aVoverthrowing capitalism.
p455
aVIt's not about
p456
aVtrying to change human nature.
p457
aVWhat we're doing here
p458
aVis we're taking a few simple steps
p459
aVtowards an economics fit for purpose.
p460
aVAnd at the heart of that economics,
p461
aVwe're placing a more credible,
p462
aVmore robust,
p463
aVand more realistic vision
p464
aVof what it means to be human.
p465
aa(lp466
VThank you very much.
p467
aa(lp468
V(Applause)
p469
aa(lp470
VChris Anderson: While they're taking the podium away, just a quick question.
p471
aVFirst of all, economists aren't supposed to be inspiring,
p472
aVso you may need to work on the tone a little.
p473
aV(Laughter)
p474
aVCan you picture the politicians ever buying into this?
p475
aVI mean, can you picture
p476
aVa politician standing up in Britain and saying,
p477
aV"GDP fell two percent this year. Good news!
p478
aVWe're actually all happier, and a country's more beautiful,
p479
aVand our lives are better."

aa(lp481
VTim Jackson: Well that's clearly not what you're doing.
p482
aVYou're not making news out of things falling down.
p483
aVYou're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing.
p484
aVCan I picture politicians doing it?
p485
aVActually, I already am seeing a little bit of it.
p486
aVWhen we first started this kind of work,
p487
aVpoliticians would stand up, treasury spokesmen would stand up,
p488
aVand accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves.
p489
aVAnd actually in the period
p490
aVthrough which we've been working over the last 18 years \u2014
p491
aVpartly because of the financial crisis
p492
aVand a little bit of humility in the profession of economics \u2014
p493
aVactually people are engaging in this issue
p494
aVin all sorts of countries around the world.

aa(lp496
VCA: But is it mainly politicians who are going to have to get their act together,
p497
aVor is it going to be more just civil society and companies?
p498
aa(lp499
VTJ: It has to be companies. It has to be civil society.
p500
aVBut it has to have political leadership.
p501
aVThis is a kind of agenda,
p502
aVwhich actually politicians themselves
p503
aVare kind of caught in that dilemma,
p504
aVbecause they're hooked on the growth model themselves.
p505
aVBut actually opening up the space
p506
aVto think about different ways of governing,
p507
aVdifferent kinds of politics,
p508
aVand creating the space
p509
aVfor civil society and businesses to operate differently \u2014
p510
aVabsolutely vital.
p511
aa(lp512
VCA: And if someone could convince you
p513
aVthat we actually can make the \u2014 what was it? \u2014
p514
aVthe 130-fold improvement in efficiency,
p515
aVof reduction of carbon footprint,
p516
aVwould you then actually like that picture of economic growth
p517
aVinto more knowledge-based goods?
p518
aa(lp519
VTJ: I would still want to know that you could do that
p520
aVand get below zero by the end of the century,
p521
aVin terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere,
p522
aVand solve the problem of biodiversity
p523
aVand reduce the impact on land use
p524
aVand do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water.
p525
aVIf you can convince me we can do all that,
p526
aVthen, yes, I would take the two percent.
