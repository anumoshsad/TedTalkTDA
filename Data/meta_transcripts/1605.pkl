VWhat I want you all to do right now
p4
aVis to think of this mammal that I'm going to describe to you.
p5
aVThe first thing I'm going to tell you about this mammal
p6
aVis that it is essential for our ecosystems to function correctly.
p7
aVIf we remove this mammal from our ecosystems,
p8
aVthey simply will not work.
p9
aVThat's the first thing.
p10
aVThe second thing is that due to the unique sensory abilities
p11
aVof this mammal, if we study this mammal,
p12
aVwe're going to get great insight into our diseases
p13
aVof the senses, such as blindness and deafness.
p14
aVAnd the third really intriguing aspect of this mammal
p15
aVis that I fully believe that the secret of everlasting youth
p16
aVlies deep within its DNA.
p17
aVSo are you all thinking?
p18
aVSo,
p19
aVmagnificent creature, isn't it?
p20
aVWho here thought of a bat?
p21
aVAh, I can see half the audience agrees with me,
p22
aVand I have a lot of work to do to convince the rest of you.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo I have had the good fortune for the past 20 years
p25
aVto study these fascinating and beautiful mammals.
p26
aVOne fifth of all living mammals is a bat,
p27
aVand they have very unique attributes.
p28
aVBats as we know them have been around on this planet
p29
aVfor about 64 million years.
p30
aVOne of the most unique things that bats do
p31
aVas a mammal is that they fly.
p32
aVNow flight is an inherently difficult thing.
p33
aVFlight within vertebrates has only evolved three times:
p34
aVonce in the bats, once in the birds,
p35
aVand once in the pterodactyls.
p36
aVAnd so with flight, it's very metabolically costly.
p37
aVBats have learned and evolved how to deal with this.
p38
aa(lp39
VBut one other extremely unique thing about bats
p40
aVis that they are able to use sound
p41
aVto perceive their environment. They use echolocation.
p42
aVNow, what I mean by echolocation \u2014
p43
aVthey emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth
p44
aVor through their nose. This sound wave comes out
p45
aVand it reflects and echoes back off objects in their environment,
p46
aVand the bats then hear these echoes
p47
aVand they turn this information into an acoustic image.
p48
aVAnd this enables them to orient in complete darkness.
p49
aVIndeed, they do look very strange. We're humans.
p50
aVWe're a visual species. When scientists first realized
p51
aVthat bats were actually using sound to be able to fly
p52
aVand orient and move at night, we didn't believe it.
p53
aVFor a hundred years, despite evidence to show
p54
aVthat this is what they were doing, we didn't believe it.
p55
aa(lp56
VNow, if you look at this bat, it looks a little bit alien.
p57
aVIndeed, the very famous philosopher Thomas Nagel
p58
aVonce said, "To truly experience an alien life form
p59
aVon this planet, you should lock yourself inside a room
p60
aVwith a flying, echolocating bat in complete darkness."
p61
aVAnd if you look at the actual physical characteristics
p62
aVon the face of this beautiful horseshoe bat,
p63
aVyou see a lot of these characteristics are dedicated
p64
aVto be able to make sound and perceive it.
p65
aVVery big ears, strange nose leaves, but teeny-tiny eyes.
p66
aVSo again, if you just look at this bat, you realize
p67
aVsound is very important for its survival.
p68
aa(lp69
VMost bats look like the previous one.
p70
aVHowever, there are a group that do not use echolocation.
p71
aVThey do not perceive their environment using sound,
p72
aVand these are the flying foxes.
p73
aVIf anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in Australia,
p74
aVyou've seen them coming out of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney,
p75
aVand if you just look at their face, you can see
p76
aVthey have much, much larger eyes and much smaller ears.
p77
aVSo among and within bats is a huge variation
p78
aVin their ability to use sensory perception.
p79
aVNow this is going to be important for what I'm going
p80
aVto tell you later during the talk.
p81
aa(lp82
VNow, if the idea of bats in your belfry terrifies you,
p83
aVand I know some people probably are feeling a little sick
p84
aVlooking at very large images of bats,
p85
aVthat's probably not that surprising,
p86
aVbecause here in Western culture,
p87
aVbats have been demonized.
p88
aVReally, of course the famous book "Dracula,"
p89
aVwritten by a fellow Northside Dubliner Bram Stoker,
p90
aVprobably is mainly responsible for this.
p91
aVHowever, I also think it's got to do with the fact
p92
aVthat bats come out at night, and we don't
p93
aVreally understand them. We're a little frightened by things
p94
aVthat can perceive the world slightly differently than us.
p95
aVBats are usually synonymous with some type of evil events.
p96
aVThey are the perpetrators in horror movies,
p97
aVsuch as this famous "Nightwing."
p98
aVAlso, if you think about it, demons
p99
aValways have bat wings, whereas birds, they typically \u2014
p100
aVor angels have bird wings.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, this is Western society, and what I hope to do tonight
p103
aVis to convince you of the Chinese traditional culture,
p104
aVthat they perceive bats as
p105
aVcreatures that bring good luck, and indeed, if you walk
p106
aVinto a Chinese home, you may see an image such as this.
p107
aVThis is considered the Five Blessings.
p108
aVThe Chinese word for "bat" sounds like the Chinese word
p109
aVfor "happiness," and they believe that bats
p110
aVbring wealth, health, longevity, virtue and serenity.
p111
aVAnd indeed, in this image, you have a picture of longevity
p112
aVsurrounded by five bats.
p113
aVAnd what I want to do tonight is to talk to you
p114
aVand to show you that at least three of these blessings
p115
aVare definitely represented by a bat, and that if we study bats
p116
aVwe will get nearer to getting each of these blessings.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo, wealth \u2014 how can a bat possibly bring us wealth?
p119
aVNow as I said before, bats are essential for our ecosystems
p120
aVto function correctly. And why is this?
p121
aVBats in the tropics are major pollinators of many plants.
p122
aVThey also feed on fruit, and they disperse the seeds
p123
aVof these fruits. Bats are responsible for pollinating
p124
aVthe tequila plant, and this is a multi-million dollar industry
p125
aVin Mexico. So indeed, we need them
p126
aVfor our ecosystems to function properly.
p127
aVWithout them, it's going to be a problem.
p128
aVBut most bats are voracious insect predators.
p129
aVIt's been estimated in the U.S., in a tiny colony
p130
aVof big brown bats, that they will feed
p131
aVon over a million insects a year,
p132
aVand in the United States of America, right now
p133
aVbats are being threatened by a disease known as white-nose syndrome.
p134
aVIt's working its way slowly across the U.S. and wiping out
p135
aVpopulations of bats, and scientists have estimated
p136
aVthat 1,300 metric tons of insects a year are now
p137
aVremaining in the ecosystems due to the loss of bats.
p138
aVBats are also threatened in the U.S.
p139
aVby their attraction to wind farms. Again, right now
p140
aVbats are looking at a little bit of a problem.
p141
aVThey're going to \u2014 They are very threatened
p142
aVin the United States of America alone.
p143
aa(lp144
VNow how can this help us?
p145
aVWell, it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats
p146
aVfrom the equation, we're going to have to then use
p147
aVinsecticides to remove all those pest insects
p148
aVthat feed on our agricultural crops.
p149
aVAnd for one year in the U.S. alone, it's estimated
p150
aVthat it's going to cost 22 billion U.S. dollars,
p151
aVif we remove bats. So indeed, bats then do bring us wealth.
p152
aVThey maintain the health of our ecosystems,
p153
aVand also they save us money.
p154
aVSo again, that's the first blessing. Bats are important
p155
aVfor our ecosystems.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd what about the second? What about health?
p158
aVInside every cell in your body lies your genome.
p159
aVYour genome is made up of your DNA,
p160
aVyour DNA codes for proteins that enable you to function
p161
aVand interact and be as you are.
p162
aVNow since the new advancements in modern molecular technologies,
p163
aVit is now possible for us to sequence our own genome
p164
aVin a very rapid time and at a very, very reduced cost.
p165
aVNow when we've been doing this, we've realized
p166
aVthat there's variations within our genome.
p167
aVSo I want you to look at the person beside you.
p168
aVJust have a quick look. And what we need to realize
p169
aVis that every 300 base pairs in your DNA, you're a little bit different.
p170
aVAnd one of the grand challenges right now
p171
aVin modern molecular medicine is to work out
p172
aVwhether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases,
p173
aVor does this variation just make you different?
p174
aVAgain, what does it mean here? What does this variation
p175
aVactually mean? So if we are to capitalize on all of this
p176
aVnew molecular data and personalized genomic information
p177
aVthat is coming online that we will be able to have
p178
aVin the next few years, we have to be able to differentiate
p179
aVbetween the two. So how do we do this?
p180
aa(lp181
VWell, I believe we just look at nature's experiments.
p182
aVSo through natural selection, over time,
p183
aVmutations, variations that disrupt the function of a protein
p184
aVwill not be tolerated over time.
p185
aVEvolution acts as a sieve. It sieves out the bad variation.
p186
aVAnd so therefore, if you look at the same region
p187
aVof a genome in many mammals that have been
p188
aVevolutionarily distant from each other
p189
aVand are also ecologically divergent, you will get a better
p190
aVunderstanding of what the evolutionary prior of that site is,
p191
aVi.e., if it is important for the mammal to function,
p192
aVfor its survival, it will be the same
p193
aVin all of those different lineages, species, taxa.
p194
aVSo therefore, if we were to do this,
p195
aVwhat we'd need to do is sequence that region
p196
aVin all these different mammals and ascertain if it's the same
p197
aVor if it's different. So if it is the same,
p198
aVthis indicates that that site is important for a function,
p199
aVso a disease mutation should fall within that site.
p200
aVSo in this case here, if all the mammals that we look at
p201
aVhave a yellow-type genome at that site,
p202
aVit probably suggests that purple is bad.
p203
aVThis could be even more powerful if you look at mammals
p204
aVthat are doing things slightly differently.
p205
aVSo say, for example, the region of the genome
p206
aVthat I was looking at was a region that's important for vision.
p207
aVIf we look at that region in mammals that don't see so well,
p208
aVsuch as bats, and we find that bats that don't see so well
p209
aVhave the purple type, we know that this is probably
p210
aVwhat's causing this disease.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo in my lab, we've been using bats to look at two different
p213
aVtypes of diseases of the senses.
p214
aVWe're looking at blindness. Now why would you do this?
p215
aVThree hundred and fourteen million people are visually impaired, and
p216
aV45 million of these are blind. So blindness is a big problem,
p217
aVand a lot of these blind disorders come from inherited diseases,
p218
aVso we want to try and better understand
p219
aVwhich mutations in the gene cause the disease.
p220
aVAlso we look at deafness. One in every 1,000
p221
aVnewborn babies are deaf, and when we reach 80,
p222
aVover half of us will also have a hearing problem.
p223
aVAgain, there's many underlying genetic causes for this.
p224
aVSo what we've been doing in my lab
p225
aVis looking at these unique sensory specialists, the bats,
p226
aVand we have looked at genes that cause blindness
p227
aVwhen there's a defect in them,
p228
aVgenes that cause deafness when there's a defect in them,
p229
aVand now we can predict which sites are most likely to cause disease.
p230
aVSo bats are also important for our health,
p231
aVto enable us to better understand how our genome functions.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo this is where we are right now,
p234
aVbut what about the future?
p235
aVWhat about longevity?
p236
aVThis is where we're going to go, and as I said before,
p237
aVI really believe that the secret of everlasting youth
p238
aVlies within the bat genome.
p239
aVSo why should we be interested in aging at all?
p240
aVWell, really, this is a picture drawn from the 1500s
p241
aVof the Fountain of Youth. Aging is considered
p242
aVone of the most familiar, yet the least well-understood,
p243
aVaspects of all of biology, and really,
p244
aVsince the dawn of civilization, mankind has sought to avoid it.
p245
aVBut we are going to have to understand it a bit better.
p246
aVIn Europe alone, by 2050, there is going to be
p247
aVa 70 percent increase of individuals over 65,
p248
aVand 170 percent increase in individuals over 80.
p249
aVAs we age, we deteriorate, and this deterioration
p250
aVcauses problems for our society, so we have to address it.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie
p253
aVwithin the bat genome? Does anybody want to hazard
p254
aVa guess over how long this bat could live for?
p255
aVWho \u2014 put up your hands \u2014 who says two years?
p256
aVNobody? One? How about 10 years?
p257
aVSome? How about 30?
p258
aVHow about 40? Okay, it's a whole varied response.
p259
aVThis bat is myotis brandtii. It's the longest-living bat.
p260
aVIt lived for up to 42 years,
p261
aVand this bat's still alive in the wild today.
p262
aVBut what would be so amazing about this?
p263
aa(lp264
VWell, typically, in mammals there is a relationship
p265
aVbetween body size, metabolic rate,
p266
aVand how long you can live for, and you can predict
p267
aVhow long a mammal can live for given its body size.
p268
aVSo typically, small mammals live fast, die young.
p269
aVThink of a mouse. But bats are very different.
p270
aVAs you can see here on this graph, in blue,
p271
aVthese are all other mammals, but bats
p272
aVcan live up to nine times longer than expected
p273
aVdespite having a really, really high metabolic rate,
p274
aVand the question is, how can they do that?
p275
aVThere are 19 species of mammal that live longer
p276
aVthan expected, given their body size, than man,
p277
aVand 18 of those are bats.
p278
aVSo therefore, they must have something within their DNA
p279
aVthat ables them to deal with the metabolic stresses,
p280
aVparticularly of flight. They expend three times more energy
p281
aVthan a mammal of the same size,
p282
aVbut don't seem to suffer the consequences or the effects.
p283
aVSo right now, in my lab, we're combining
p284
aVstate-of-the-art bat field biology, going out and catching
p285
aVthe long-lived bats, with the most up-to-date,
p286
aVmodern molecular technology to understand better
p287
aVwhat it is that they do to stop aging as we do.
p288
aVAnd hopefully in the next five years, I'll be giving you a TEDTalk on that.
p289
aVAging is a big problem for humanity,
p290
aVand I believe that by studying bats, we can uncover
p291
aVthe molecular mechanisms that enable mammals
p292
aVto achieve extraordinary longevity. If we find out
p293
aVwhat they're doing, perhaps through gene therapy,
p294
aVwe can enable us to do the same thing.
p295
aVPotentially, this means that we could halt aging or maybe even reverse it.
p296
aVJust imagine what that would be like.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo really, I don't think we should be thinking of them
p299
aVas flying demons of the night, but more as our superheroes.
p300
aVAnd the reality is that bats can bring us so much benefit
p301
aVif we just look in the right place. They're good for our ecosystem,
p302
aVthey allow us to understand how our genome functions,
p303
aVand they potentially hold the secret to everlasting youth.
p304
aVSo tonight, when you walk out of here and you look up
p305
aVin the night skies, and you see this beautiful flying mammal,
p306
aVI want you to smile. Thank you. (Applause)
