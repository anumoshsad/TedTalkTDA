VI want you to, for a moment,
p4
aVthink about playing a game of Monopoly.
p5
aVExcept in this game, that combination of skill, talent and luck
p6
aVthat helped earn you success in games, as in life,
p7
aVhas been rendered irrelevant,
p8
aVbecause this game's been rigged,
p9
aVand you've got the upper hand.
p10
aVYou've got more money,
p11
aVmore opportunities to move around the board,
p12
aVand more access to resources.
p13
aVAnd as you think about that experience,
p14
aVI want you to ask yourself:
p15
aVHow might that experience of being a privileged player in a rigged game
p16
aVchange the way you think about yourself
p17
aVand regard that other player?
p18
aa(lp19
VSo, we ran a study on the UC Berkeley campus
p20
aVto look at exactly that question.
p21
aVWe brought in more than 100 pairs of strangers into the lab,
p22
aVand with the flip of a coin,
p23
aVrandomly assigned one of the two to be a rich player in a rigged game.
p24
aVThey got two times as much money;
p25
aVwhen they passed Go, they collected twice the salary;
p26
aVand they got to roll both dice instead of one,
p27
aVso they got to move around the board a lot more.
p28
aa(lp29
V(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd over the course of 15 minutes,
p32
aVwe watched through hidden cameras what happened.
p33
aVWhat I want to do today, for the first time,
p34
aVis show you a little bit of what we saw.
p35
aVYou'll to have to pardon the sound quality,
p36
aVbecause again, these were hidden cameras.
p37
aVSo we've provided subtitles.
p38
aa(lp39
V[Video] Rich Player: How many 500s did you have?
p40
aa(lp41
VPoor Player: Just one.
p42
aa(lp43
VRP: Are you serious? PP: Yeah.
p44
aa(lp45
VRP: I have three. (Laughs) I don't know why they gave me so much.
p46
aa(lp47
VPaul Piff: So it was quickly apparent to players that something was up.
p48
aVOne person clearly has a lot more money than the other person,
p49
aVand yet, as the game unfolded,
p50
aVwe saw very notable differences, dramatic differences begin to emerge
p51
aVbetween the two players.
p52
aVThe rich player started to move around the board louder,
p53
aVliterally smacking the board with the piece as he went around.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Game piece smacks board)
p56
aa(lp57
VWe were more likely to see signs of dominance
p58
aVand nonverbal signs, displays of power
p59
aVand celebration among the rich players.
p60
aa(lp61
VWe had a bowl of pretzels positioned off to the side.
p62
aVIt's on the bottom right corner.
p63
aVThat allowed us to watch participants' consummatory behavior.
p64
aVSo we're just tracking how many pretzels participants eat.
p65
aa(lp66
V[Video] RP: Are those pretzels a trick?
p67
aa(lp68
VPP: I don't know.
p69
aa(lp70
VPaul Piff: OK, so no surprises, people are on to us.
p71
aVThey wonder what that bowl of pretzels is doing there in the first place.
p72
aVOne even asks, like you just saw,
p73
aV"Is that bowl of pretzels there as a trick?"
p74
aVAnd yet, despite that, the power of the situation
p75
aVseems to inevitably dominate,
p76
aVand those rich players start to eat more pretzels.
p77
aa(lp78
V(Laughter)
p79
aa(lp80
V[Video] RP: I love pretzels.
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VPaul Piff: And as the game went on,
p85
aVone of the really interesting and dramatic patterns
p86
aVthat we observed begin to emerge
p87
aVwas that the rich players actually started to become ruder
p88
aVtoward the other person \u2014
p89
aVless and less sensitive to the plight of those poor, poor players,
p90
aVand more and more demonstrative of their material success,
p91
aVmore likely to showcase how well they're doing.
p92
aa(lp93
V[Video] RP: I have money ...
p94
aa(lp95
V(Laughs) I have money for everything.
p96
aa(lp97
VPP: How much is that?
p98
aa(lp99
VRP: You owe me 24 dollars.
p100
aVYou're going to lose all your money soon.
p101
aVI'll buy it. I have so much money.
p102
aVI have so much money, it takes me forever.
p103
aa(lp104
VRP 2: I'm going to buy out this whole board.
p105
aa(lp106
VRP 3: You're going to run out of money soon.
p107
aVI'm pretty much untouchable at this point.
p108
aa(lp109
V(Laughter)
p110
aa(lp111
VPaul Piff: And here's what I think was really, really interesting:
p112
aVit's that, at the end of the 15 minutes,
p113
aVwe asked the players to talk about their experience during the game.
p114
aVAnd when the rich players talked about why they had inevitably won
p115
aVin this rigged game of Monopoly ...
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VThey talked about what they'd done to buy those different properties
p120
aVand earn their success in the game.
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd they became far less attuned
p125
aVto all those different features of the situation \u2014
p126
aVincluding that flip of a coin \u2014
p127
aVthat had randomly gotten them into that privileged position
p128
aVin the first place.
p129
aVAnd that's a really, really incredible insight
p130
aVinto how the mind makes sense of advantage.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, this game of Monopoly can be used
p133
aVas a metaphor for understanding society and its hierarchical structure,
p134
aVwherein some people have a lot of wealth and a lot of status,
p135
aVand a lot of people don't;
p136
aVthey have a lot less wealth and a lot less status
p137
aVand a lot less access to valued resources.
p138
aVAnd what my colleagues and I for the last seven years have been doing
p139
aVis studying the effects of these kinds of hierarchies.
p140
aVWhat we've been finding across dozens of studies
p141
aVand thousands of participants across this country
p142
aVis that as a person's levels of wealth increase,
p143
aVtheir feelings of compassion and empathy go down,
p144
aVand their feelings of entitlement, of deservingness,
p145
aVand their ideology of self-interest increase.
p146
aVIn surveys, we've found
p147
aVthat it's actually wealthier individuals who are more likely to moralize
p148
aVgreed being good,
p149
aVand that the pursuit of self-interest is favorable and moral.
p150
aVNow, what I want to do today is talk about some of the implications
p151
aVof this ideology self-interest,
p152
aVtalk about why we should care about those implications,
p153
aVand end with what might be done.
p154
aa(lp155
VSome of the first studies that we ran in this area
p156
aVlooked at helping behavior,
p157
aVsomething social psychologists call "pro-social behavior."
p158
aVAnd we were really interested
p159
aVin who's more likely to offer help to another person:
p160
aVsomeone who's rich or someone who's poor.
p161
aVIn one of the studies,
p162
aVwe bring rich and poor members of the community into the lab,
p163
aVand give each of them the equivalent of 10 dollars.
p164
aVWe told the participants they could keep these 10 dollars for themselves,
p165
aVor they could share a portion of it, if they wanted to,
p166
aVwith a stranger, who's totally anonymous.
p167
aVThey'll never meet that stranger; the stranger will never meet them.
p168
aVAnd we just monitor how much people give.
p169
aVIndividuals who made 25,000, sometimes under 15,000 dollars a year,
p170
aVgave 44 percent more of their money to the stranger
p171
aVthan did individuals making 150,000, 200,000 dollars a year.
p172
aa(lp173
VWe've had people play games
p174
aVto see who's more or less likely to cheat
p175
aVto increase their chances of winning a prize.
p176
aVIn one of the games, we actually rigged a computer
p177
aVso that die rolls over a certain score were impossible \u2014
p178
aVYou couldn't get above 12 in this game, and yet ...
p179
aVthe richer you were, the more likely you were to cheat in this game
p180
aVto earn credits toward a $50 cash prize \u2014
p181
aVsometimes by three to four times as much.
p182
aa(lp183
VWe ran another study
p184
aVwhere we looked at whether people would be inclined to take candy
p185
aVfrom a jar of candy that we explicitly identified
p186
aVas being reserved for children \u2014
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VI'm not kidding \u2014 I know it sounds like I'm making a joke.
p191
aVWe explicitly told participants:
p192
aV"This candy is for children participating in a developmental lab nearby.
p193
aVThey're in studies. This is for them."
p194
aVAnd we just monitored how much candy participants took.
p195
aVParticipants who felt rich took two times as much candy
p196
aVas participants who felt poor.
p197
aa(lp198
VWe've even studied cars.
p199
aVNot just any cars,
p200
aVbut whether drivers of different kinds of cars
p201
aVare more or less inclined to break the law.
p202
aVIn one of these studies,
p203
aVwe looked at whether drivers would stop for a pedestrian
p204
aVthat we had posed waiting to cross at a crosswalk.
p205
aVNow in California, as you all know,
p206
aVbecause I'm sure we all do this,
p207
aVit's the law to stop for a pedestrian who's waiting to cross.
p208
aVSo here's an example of how we did it.
p209
aVThat's our confederate off to the left, posing as a pedestrian.
p210
aVHe approaches as the red truck successfully stops.
p211
aVIn typical California fashion,
p212
aVit's overtaken by the bus who almost runs our pedestrian over.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VNow here's an example of a more expensive car,
p217
aVa Prius, driving through, and a BMW doing the same.
p218
aVSo we did this for hundreds of vehicles
p219
aVon several days,
p220
aVjust tracking who stops and who doesn't.
p221
aVWhat we found was as the expensiveness of a car increased ...
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
Vthe drivers' tendencies to break the law increased as well.
p226
aVNone of the cars \u2014 none of the cars \u2014
p227
aVin our least expensive car category
p228
aVbroke the law.
p229
aVClose to 50 percent of the cars in our most expensive vehicle category
p230
aVbroke the law.
p231
aVWe've run other studies,
p232
aVfinding that wealthier individuals are more likely to lie in negotiations,
p233
aVto endorse unethical behavior at work,
p234
aVlike stealing cash from the cash register,
p235
aVtaking bribes, lying to customers.
p236
aa(lp237
VNow, I don't mean to suggest
p238
aVthat it's only wealthy people who show these patterns of behavior.
p239
aVNot at all \u2014 in fact, I think that we all,
p240
aVin our day-to-day, minute-by-minute lives,
p241
aVstruggle with these competing motivations
p242
aVof when or if to put our own interests above the interests of other people.
p243
aVAnd that's understandable,
p244
aVbecause the American dream is an idea
p245
aVin which we all have an equal opportunity to succeed and prosper,
p246
aVas long as we apply ourselves and work hard.
p247
aVAnd a piece of that means that sometimes,
p248
aVyou need to put your own interests
p249
aVabove the interests and well-being of other people around you.
p250
aVBut what we're finding is that the wealthier you are,
p251
aVthe more likely you are to pursue a vision of personal success,
p252
aVof achievement and accomplishment,
p253
aVto the detriment of others around you.
p254
aa(lp255
VHere I've plotted for you the mean household income
p256
aVreceived by each fifth and top five percent of the population
p257
aVover the last 20 years.
p258
aVIn 1993,
p259
aVthe differences between the different quintiles of the population,
p260
aVin terms of income,
p261
aVare fairly egregious.
p262
aVIt's not difficult to discern that there are differences.
p263
aVBut over the last 20 years, that significant difference
p264
aVhas become a Grand Canyon of sorts
p265
aVbetween those at the top and everyone else.
p266
aVIn fact, the top 20 percent of our population
p267
aVown close to 90 percent of the total wealth in this country.
p268
aa(lp269
VWe're at unprecedented levels of economic inequality.
p270
aVWhat that means is that wealth is not only becoming increasingly concentrated
p271
aVin the hands of a select group of individuals,
p272
aVbut the American dream is becoming increasingly unattainable
p273
aVfor an increasing majority of us.
p274
aVAnd if it's the case, as we've been finding,
p275
aVthat the wealthier you are,
p276
aVthe more entitled you feel to that wealth,
p277
aVand the more likely you are to prioritize your own interests
p278
aVabove the interests of other people,
p279
aVand be willing to do things to serve that self-interest,
p280
aVwell, then, there's no reason to think that those patterns will change.
p281
aVIn fact, there's every reason to think that they'll only get worse,
p282
aVand that's what it would look like if things just stayed the same,
p283
aVat the same linear rate, over the next 20 years.
p284
aa(lp285
VNow inequality \u2014 economic inequality \u2014
p286
aVis something we should all be concerned about,
p287
aVand not just because of those at the bottom of the social hierarchy,
p288
aVbut because individuals and groups
p289
aVwith lots of economic inequality do worse ...
p290
aVnot just the people at the bottom, everyone.
p291
aVThere's a lot of really compelling research
p292
aVcoming out from top labs all over the world,
p293
aVshowcasing the range of things that are undermined
p294
aVas economic inequality gets worse.
p295
aVSocial mobility, things we really care about,
p296
aVphysical health, social trust,
p297
aVall go down as inequality goes up.
p298
aVSimilarly, negative things in social collectives and societies,
p299
aVthings like obesity, and violence,
p300
aVimprisonment, and punishment,
p301
aVare exacerbated as economic inequality increases.
p302
aVAgain, these are outcomes not just experienced by a few,
p303
aVbut that resound across all strata of society.
p304
aVEven people at the top experience these outcomes.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo what do we do?
p307
aVThis cascade of self-perpetuating,
p308
aVpernicious, negative effects
p309
aVcould seem like something that's spun out of control,
p310
aVand there's nothing we can do about it,
p311
aVcertainly nothing we as individuals could do.
p312
aVBut in fact, we've been finding in our own laboratory research
p313
aVthat small psychological interventions,
p314
aVsmall changes to people's values,
p315
aVsmall nudges in certain directions,
p316
aVcan restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy.
p317
aVFor instance, reminding people of the benefits of cooperation
p318
aVor the advantages of community,
p319
aVcause wealthier individuals to be just as egalitarian
p320
aVas poor people.
p321
aa(lp322
VIn one study, we had people watch a brief video, just 46 seconds long,
p323
aVabout childhood poverty
p324
aVthat served as a reminder of the needs of others in the world around them.
p325
aVAnd after watching that,
p326
aVwe looked at how willing people were to offer up their own time
p327
aVto a stranger presented to them in the lab, who was in distress.
p328
aVAfter watching this video, an hour later,
p329
aVrich people became just as generous of their own time
p330
aVto help out this other person, a stranger,
p331
aVas someone who's poor,
p332
aVsuggesting that these differences are not innate or categorical,
p333
aVbut are so malleable to slight changes in people's values,
p334
aVand little nudges of compassion and bumps of empathy.
p335
aa(lp336
VAnd beyond the walls of our lab,
p337
aVwe're even beginning to see signs of change in society.
p338
aVBill Gates, one of our nation's wealthiest individuals,
p339
aVin his Harvard commencement speech,
p340
aVtalked about the problem of inequality facing society
p341
aVas being the most daunting challenge,
p342
aVand talked about what must be done to combat it,
p343
aVsaying, "Humanity's greatest advances are not in its discoveries \u2014
p344
aVbut in how those discoveries are applied
p345
aVto reduce inequity."
p346
aVAnd there's the Giving Pledge,
p347
aVin which more than 100 of our nation's wealthiest individuals
p348
aVare pledging half of their fortunes to charity.
p349
aVAnd there's the emergence of dozens of grassroots movements,
p350
aVlike "We are the 1 percent,"
p351
aV"Resource Generation,"
p352
aVor "Wealth for Common Good,"
p353
aVin which the most privileged members of the population,
p354
aVmembers of the one percent and elsewhere,
p355
aVpeople who are wealthy,
p356
aVare using their own economic resources,
p357
aVadults and youth alike \u2014 that's what's most striking to me \u2014
p358
aVleveraging their own privilege, their own economic resources,
p359
aVto combat inequality
p360
aVby advocating for social policies,
p361
aVchanges in social values
p362
aVand changes in people's behavior
p363
aVthat work against their own economic interests,
p364
aVbut that may ultimately restore the American dream.
