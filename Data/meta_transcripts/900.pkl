VIt's a great honor today
p4
aVto share with you
p5
aVThe Digital Universe,
p6
aVwhich was created for humanity
p7
aVto really see where we are
p8
aVin the universe.
p9
aVAnd so I think we can roll the video that we have.
p10
aa(lp11
V[The Himalayas.]
p12
aa(lp13
V(Music)
p14
aa(lp15
VThe flat horizon that we've evolved with
p16
aVhas been a metaphor for the
p17
aVinfinite: unbounded resources
p18
aVand unlimited capacity
p19
aVfor disposal of waste.
p20
aVIt wasn't until we really
p21
aVleft Earth,
p22
aVgot above the atmosphere
p23
aVand had seen the horizon
p24
aVbend back on itself,
p25
aVthat we could understand our planet
p26
aVas a limited condition.
p27
aVThe Digital Universe Atlas
p28
aVhas been built
p29
aVat the American Museum of Natural History
p30
aVover the past 12 years.
p31
aVWe maintain that,
p32
aVput that together
p33
aVas a project
p34
aVto really chart the universe
p35
aVacross all scales.
p36
aVWhat we see here are satellites around the Earth
p37
aVand the Earth in proper registration
p38
aVagainst the universe, as we see.
p39
aVNASA supported this work
p40
aV12 years ago
p41
aVas part of the rebuilding
p42
aVof the Hayden Planetarium
p43
aVso that we would share this with the world.
p44
aa(lp45
VThe Digital Universe is the basis
p46
aVof our space show productions that we do \u2014
p47
aVour main space shows in the dome.
p48
aVBut what you see here
p49
aVis the result of, actually, internships
p50
aVthat we hosted with Linkoping University
p51
aVin Sweden.
p52
aVI've had 12 students work on this
p53
aVfor their graduate work,
p54
aVand the result has been this software called Uniview
p55
aVand a company called SCISS in Sweden.
p56
aVThis software
p57
aVallows interactive use,
p58
aVso this actual flight path
p59
aVand movie that we see here
p60
aVwas actually flown live.
p61
aVI captured this live from my laptop
p62
aVin a cafe called Earth Matters
p63
aVon the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where I live,
p64
aVand it was done
p65
aVas a collaborative project
p66
aVwith the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art
p67
aVfor an exhibit
p68
aVon comparative cosmology.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd so as we move out,
p71
aVwe see continuously from our planet
p72
aVall the way out into the realm of galaxies, as we see here,
p73
aVlight-travel time, giving you a sense of how far away we are.
p74
aVAs we move out,
p75
aVthe light from these distant galaxies
p76
aVhave taken so long,
p77
aVwe're essentially backing up into the past.
p78
aVWe back so far up
p79
aVwe're finally seeing a containment around us \u2014
p80
aVthe afterglow of the Big Bang.
p81
aVThis is the WMAP
p82
aVmicrowave background
p83
aVthat we see.
p84
aVWe'll fly outside it here, just to see this sort of containment.
p85
aVIf we were outside this,
p86
aVit would almost be meaningless, in the sense as before time.
p87
aVBut this our containment of the visible universe.
p88
aVWe know the universe is bigger than that which we can see.
p89
aa(lp90
VComing back quickly,
p91
aVwe see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning,
p92
aVbut these are positions,
p93
aVthe latest positions of exoplanets
p94
aVthat we've mapped,
p95
aVand our sun here, obviously, with our own solar system.
p96
aVWhat you're going to see \u2014 we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly
p97
aVbetween several orders of magnitude
p98
aVto get down to where we see the solar system \u2014
p99
aVthese are the paths of
p100
aVVoyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 11 and Pioneer 10,
p101
aVthe first four spacecraft to have left the solar system.
p102
aVComing in closer,
p103
aVpicking up Earth,
p104
aVorbit of the Moon, and we see the Earth.
p105
aVThis map can be updated,
p106
aVand we can add in new data.
p107
aa(lp108
VI know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I.
p109
aVfor the Cassini mission.
p110
aVBut here we see the complex trajectory
p111
aVof the Cassini mission
p112
aVcolor coded for different mission phases,
p113
aVingeniously developed so that
p114
aV45 encounters with the largest moon, Titan,
p115
aVwhich is larger that the planet Mercury,
p116
aVdiverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase.
p117
aa(lp118
VThis software allows us to come close
p119
aVand look at parts of this.
p120
aVThis software can also be networked between domes.
p121
aVWe have a growing user base of this,
p122
aVand we network domes.
p123
aVAnd we can network between domes and classrooms.
p124
aVWe're actually sharing tours of the universe
p125
aVwith the first sub-Saharan
p126
aVplanetarium in Ghana
p127
aVas well as
p128
aVnew libraries that have been built
p129
aVin the ghettos in Columbia
p130
aVand a high school
p131
aVin Cambodia.
p132
aVAnd the Cambodians have
p133
aVactually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school.
p134
aa(lp135
VThis is an image from Saturday,
p136
aVphotographed by the Aqua satellite, but through the Uniview software.
p137
aVSo you're seeing the edge of the Earth.
p138
aVThis is Nepal.
p139
aVThis is, in fact, right here is the valley of Lhasa,
p140
aVright here in Tibet.
p141
aVBut we can see the haze
p142
aVfrom fires and so forth in the Ganges valley
p143
aVdown below in India.
p144
aVThis is Nepal and Tibet.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd just in closing,
p147
aVI'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on \u2014
p148
aVhere we see a bit of the snow
p149
aVthat some of you may have had to brave in coming out \u2014
p150
aVso I'd like to just say
p151
aVthat what the world needs now
p152
aVis a sense of being able to
p153
aVlook at ourselves in this much larger condition now
p154
aVand a much larger sense of what home is.
p155
aVBecause our home is the universe,
p156
aVand we are the universe, essentially.
p157
aVWe carry that in us.
p158
aVAnd to be able to see our context
p159
aVin this larger sense at all scales
p160
aVhelps us all, I think, in understanding
p161
aVwhere we are and who we are in the universe.
p162
aa(lp163
VThank you.
