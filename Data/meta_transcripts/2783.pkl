VIt's six o'clock in the morning,
p4
aVpitch black outside.
p5
aVMy 14-year-old son is fast asleep in his bed,
p6
aVsleeping the reckless, deep sleep of a teenager.
p7
aVI flip on the light and physically shake the poor boy awake,
p8
aVbecause I know that, like ripping off a Band-Aid,
p9
aVit's better to get it over with quickly.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VI have a friend who yells "Fire!" just to rouse her sleeping teen.
p14
aVAnd another who got so fed up
p15
aVthat she had to dump cold water on her son's head
p16
aVjust to get him out of bed.
p17
aVSound brutal ...
p18
aVbut perhaps familiar?
p19
aa(lp20
VEvery morning I ask myself,
p21
aV"How can I \u2014
p22
aVknowing what I know
p23
aVand doing what I do for a living \u2014
p24
aVbe doing this to my own son?"
p25
aVYou see,
p26
aVI'm a sleep researcher.
p27
aa(lp28
V(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VSo I know far too much about sleep
p31
aVand the consequences of sleep loss.
p32
aVI know that I'm depriving my son of the sleep he desperately needs
p33
aVas a rapidly growing teenager.
p34
aVI also know that by waking him up
p35
aVhours before his natural biological clock tells him he's ready,
p36
aVI'm literally robbing him of his dreams \u2014
p37
aVthe type of sleep most associated with learning, memory consolidation
p38
aVand emotional processing.
p39
aa(lp40
VBut it's not just my kid that's being deprived of sleep.
p41
aVSleep deprivation among American teenagers is an epidemic.
p42
aVOnly about one in 10 gets the eight to 10 hours of sleep per night
p43
aVrecommended by sleep scientists and pediatricians.
p44
aVNow, if you're thinking to yourself,
p45
aV"Phew, we're doing good, my kid's getting eight hours,"
p46
aVremember,
p47
aVeight hours is the minimum recommendation.
p48
aVYou're barely passing.
p49
aVEight hours is kind of like getting a C on your report card.
p50
aa(lp51
VThere are many factors contributing to this epidemic,
p52
aVbut a major factor preventing teens from getting the sleep they need
p53
aVis actually a matter of public policy.
p54
aVNot hormones, social lives or Snapchat.
p55
aVAcross the country,
p56
aVmany schools are starting around 7:30am or earlier,
p57
aVdespite the fact that major medical organizations recommend
p58
aVthat middle and high school start no earlier than 8:30am.
p59
aVThese early start policies have a direct effect on how much \u2014
p60
aVor really how little sleep American teenagers are getting.
p61
aa(lp62
VThey're also pitting teenagers and their parents
p63
aVin a fundamentally unwinnable fight against their own bodies.
p64
aVAround the time of puberty,
p65
aVteenagers experience a delay in their biological clock,
p66
aVwhich determines when we feel most awake and when we feel most sleepy.
p67
aVThis is driven in part by a shift in the release of the hormone melatonin.
p68
aVTeenagers' bodies wait to start releasing melatonin until around 11pm,
p69
aVwhich is two hours later than what we see in adults or younger children.
p70
aVThis means that waking a teenager up at 6am is the biological equivalent
p71
aVof waking an adult up at 4am.
p72
aVOn the unfortunate days when I have to wake up at 4am,
p73
aVI'm a zombie.
p74
aVFunctionally useless.
p75
aVI can't think straight,
p76
aVI'm irritable,
p77
aVand I probably shouldn't be driving a car.
p78
aVBut this is how many American teenagers feel every single school day.
p79
aVIn fact, many of the, shall we say,
p80
aVunpleasant characteristics that we chalk up to being a teenager \u2014
p81
aVmoodiness, irritability, laziness, depression \u2014
p82
aVcould be a product of chronic sleep deprivation.
p83
aVFor many teens battling chronic sleep loss,
p84
aVtheir go-to strategy to compensate is consuming large quantities of caffeine
p85
aVin the form of venti frappuccinos,
p86
aVor energy drinks and shots.
p87
aVSo essentially,
p88
aVwe've got an entire population of tired but wired youth.
p89
aa(lp90
VAdvocates of sleep-friendly start times know
p91
aVthat adolescence is a period of dramatic brain development,
p92
aVparticularly in the parts of the brain
p93
aVthat are responsible for those higher order thinking processes,
p94
aVincluding reasoning, problem-solving and good judgment.
p95
aVIn other words, the very type of brain activity that's responsible
p96
aVfor reining in those impulsive and often risky behaviors
p97
aVthat are so characteristic of adolescence
p98
aVand that are so terrifying to us parents of teenagers.
p99
aVThey know that like the rest of us,
p100
aVwhen teenagers don't get the sleep they need,
p101
aVtheir brains, their bodies and behaviors suffer
p102
aVwith both immediate and lasting effects.
p103
aVThey can't concentrate,
p104
aVtheir attention plummets
p105
aVand many will even show behavioral signs that mimic ADHD.
p106
aa(lp107
VBut the consequences of teen sleep loss go well beyond the classroom,
p108
aVsadly contributing to many of the mental health problems
p109
aVthat skyrocket during adolescence,
p110
aVincluding substance use,
p111
aVdepression and suicide.
p112
aVIn our work with teens from LA Unified School District,
p113
aVwe found that teens with sleep problems
p114
aVwere 55 percent more likely to have used alcohol in the past month.
p115
aVIn another study with over 30,000 high school students,
p116
aVthey found that for each hour of lost sleep,
p117
aVthere was a 38 percent increase in feeling sad or hopeless,
p118
aVand a 58 percent increase in teen suicide attempts.
p119
aVAnd if that's not enough,
p120
aVteens who skip out on sleep are at increased risk
p121
aVfor a host of physical health problems that plague our country,
p122
aVincluding obesity, heart disease and diabetes.
p123
aVThen there's the risk of putting a sleep-deprived teen,
p124
aVwith a newly minted driver's license,
p125
aVbehind the wheel.
p126
aVStudies have shown that getting five hours or less of sleep per night
p127
aVis the equivalent of driving with a blood alcohol content above the legal limit.
p128
aa(lp129
VAdvocates of sleep-friendly start times,
p130
aVand researchers in this area,
p131
aVhave produced tremendous science
p132
aVshowing the tremendous benefits of later start times.
p133
aVThe findings are unequivocal,
p134
aVand as a sleep scientist,
p135
aVI rarely get to speak with that kind of certainty.
p136
aVTeens from districts with later start times get more sleep.
p137
aVTo the naysayers who may think that if schools start later,
p138
aVteens will just stay up later,
p139
aVthe truth is,
p140
aVtheir bedtimes stay the same,
p141
aVbut their wake-up times get extended,
p142
aVresulting in more sleep.
p143
aVThey're more likely to show up for school;
p144
aVschool absences dropped by 25 percent in one district.
p145
aVAnd they're less likely to drop out.
p146
aVNot surprisingly, they do better academically.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo this has real implications for reducing the achievement gap.
p149
aVStandardized test scores in math and reading
p150
aVgo up by two to three percentage points.
p151
aVThat's as powerful as reducing class sizes by one-third fewer students,
p152
aVor replacing a so-so teacher in the classroom
p153
aVwith a truly outstanding one.
p154
aVTheir mental and physical health improves,
p155
aVand even their families are happier.
p156
aVI mean, who wouldn't enjoy a little more pleasantness from our teens,
p157
aVand a little less crankiness?
p158
aVEven their communities are safer
p159
aVbecause car crash rates go down \u2014
p160
aVa 70 percent reduction in one district.
p161
aa(lp162
VGiven these tremendous benefits,
p163
aVyou might think,
p164
aVwell, this is a no-brainer, right?
p165
aVSo why have we as a society failed to heed this call?
p166
aVOften the argument against later start times goes something like this:
p167
aV"Why should we delay start times for teenagers?
p168
aVWe need to toughen them up so they're ready for the real world!"
p169
aVBut that's like saying to the parent of a two-year-old,
p170
aV"Don't let Johnny nap,
p171
aVor he won't be ready for kindergarten."
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VDelaying start times also presents many logistical challenges.
p176
aVNot just for students and their families,
p177
aVbut for communities as a whole.
p178
aVUpdating bus routes,
p179
aVincreased transportation costs,
p180
aVimpact on sports,
p181
aVcare before or after school.
p182
aVThese are the same concerns that come up in district after district,
p183
aVtime and again around the country
p184
aVas school start times are debated.
p185
aVAnd they're legitimate concerns,
p186
aVbut these are problems we have to work through.
p187
aVThey are not valid excuses
p188
aVfor failing to do the right thing for our children,
p189
aVwhich is to start middle and high schools no earlier than 8:30am.
p190
aVAnd in districts around the country,
p191
aVbig and small, who have made this change,
p192
aVthey found that these fears are often unfounded
p193
aVand far outweighed by the tremendous benefits for student health
p194
aVand performance,
p195
aVand our collective public safety.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo tomorrow morning,
p198
aVwhen coincidentally we get to set our clocks back by an hour
p199
aVand you get that delicious extra hour of sleep,
p200
aVand the day seems a little longer,
p201
aVand a little more full of hope,
p202
aVthink about the tremendous power of sleep.
p203
aVAnd think about what a gift it would be
p204
aVfor our children to be able to wake up naturally,
p205
aVin harmony with their own biology.
p206
aa(lp207

p208
aVand pleasant dreams.
