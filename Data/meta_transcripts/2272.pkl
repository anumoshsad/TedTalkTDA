VI'm really excited to share with you
p4
aVsome findings that really surprise me
p5
aVabout what makes companies  succeed the most,
p6
aVwhat factors actually matter the most for startup success.
p7
aa(lp8
VI believe that the startup organization
p9
aVis one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place.
p10
aVIf you take a group of people  with the right equity incentives
p11
aVand organize them in a startup,
p12
aVyou can unlock human potential in a way never before possible.
p13
aVYou get them to achieve  unbelievable things.
p14
aa(lp15
VBut if the startup  organization is so great,
p16
aVwhy do so many fail?
p17
aVThat's what I wanted to find out.
p18
aVI wanted to find out what actually matters most
p19
aVfor startup success.
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd I wanted to try  to be systematic about it,
p22
aVavoid some of my instincts and maybe misperceptions I have
p23
aVfrom so many companies I've seen over the years.
p24
aa(lp25
VI wanted to know this
p26
aVbecause I've been starting businesses since I was 12 years old
p27
aVwhen I sold candy at the bus stop in junior high school,
p28
aVto high school, when I made solar energy devices,
p29
aVto college, when I made loudspeakers.
p30
aVAnd when I graduated from college, I started software companies.
p31
aVAnd 20 years ago, I started Idealab,
p32
aVand in the last 20 years, we started more than 100 companies,
p33
aVmany successes, and many big failures.
p34
aVWe learned a lot from those failures.
p35
aa(lp36
VSo I tried to look across what factors
p37
aVaccounted the most for company success and failure.
p38
aVSo I looked at these five.
p39
aVFirst, the idea.
p40
aVI used to think that  the idea was everything.
p41
aVI named my company Idealab for how much I worship
p42
aVthe "aha!" moment when you first come up with the idea.
p43
aVBut then over time,
p44
aVI came to think that maybe the team, the execution, adaptability,
p45
aVthat mattered even more than the idea.
p46
aa(lp47
VI never thought I'd be quoting boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage,
p48
aVbut he once said,
p49
aV"Everybody has a plan, until they get punched in the face." (Laughter)
p50
aVAnd I think that's so true about business as well.
p51
aVSo much about a team's execution
p52
aVis its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer.
p53
aVThe customer is the true reality.
p54
aVAnd that's why I came to think
p55
aVthat the team maybe was the most important thing.
p56
aa(lp57
VThen I started looking at the business model.
p58
aVDoes the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues?
p59
aVThat started rising to the top in my thinking
p60
aVabout maybe what mattered most for success.
p61
aa(lp62
VThen I looked at the funding.
p63
aVSometimes companies received intense amounts of funding.
p64
aVMaybe that's the most important thing?
p65
aa(lp66
VAnd then of course, the timing.
p67
aVIs the idea way too early and the world's not ready for it?
p68
aVIs it early, as in, you're in advance and you have to educate the world?
p69
aVIs it just right?
p70
aVOr is it too late, and there's already too many competitors?
p71
aa(lp72
VSo I tried to look very carefully at these five factors
p73
aVacross many companies.
p74
aVAnd I looked across all 100 Idealab companies,
p75
aVand 100 non-Idealab companies
p76
aVto try and come up with  something scientific about it.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo first, on these Idealab companies,
p79
aVthe top five companies \u2014
p80
aVCitysearch, CarsDirect, GoTo, NetZero, Tickets.com \u2014
p81
aVthose all became billion-dollar successes.
p82
aVAnd the five companies on the bottom \u2014
p83
aVZ.com, Insider Pages, MyLife, Desktop Factory, Peoplelink \u2014
p84
aVwe all had high hopes for, but didn't succeed.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo I tried to rank across all  of those attributes
p87
aVhow I felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions.
p88
aVAnd then for non-Idealab companies, I looked at wild successes,
p89
aVlike Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and LinkedIn.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd some failures:
p92
aVWebvan, Kozmo, Pets.com
p93
aVFlooz and Friendster.
p94
aVThe bottom companies had intense funding,
p95
aVthey even had business models in some cases,
p96
aVbut they didn't succeed.
p97
aVI tried to look at what factors actually accounted the most
p98
aVfor success and failure across all of these companies,
p99
aVand the results really surprised me.
p100
aa(lp101
VThe number one thing was timing.
p102
aVTiming accounted for 42 percent
p103
aVof the difference between success and failure.
p104
aVTeam and execution came in second,
p105
aVand the idea,
p106
aVthe differentiability of the idea, the uniqueness of the idea,
p107
aVthat actually came in third.
p108
aa(lp109
VNow, this isn't absolutely definitive,
p110
aVit's not to say that  the idea isn't important,
p111
aVbut it very much surprised me that the idea wasn't the most important thing.
p112
aVSometimes it mattered more when  it was actually timed.
p113
aa(lp114
VThe last two, business model and funding, made sense to me actually.
p115
aVI think business model makes sense to be that low
p116
aVbecause you can start out without a business model
p117
aVand add one later if your customers are demanding what you're creating.
p118
aVAnd funding, I think as well,
p119
aVif you're underfunded at first but you're gaining traction,
p120
aVespecially in today's age,
p121
aVit's very, very easy to get intense funding.
p122
aa(lp123
VSo now let me give you some specific examples about each of these.
p124
aVSo take a wild success like Airbnb that everybody knows about.
p125
aVWell, that company was famously passed on by many smart investors
p126
aVbecause people thought,
p127
aV"No one's going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger."
p128
aVOf course, people proved that wrong.
p129
aVBut one of the reasons it succeeded,
p130
aVaside from a good business model, a good idea, great execution,
p131
aVis the timing.
p132
aa(lp133
VThat company came out right during the height of the recession
p134
aVwhen people really needed extra money,
p135
aVand that maybe helped people overcome
p136
aVtheir objection to renting out their own home to a stranger.
p137
aa(lp138
VSame thing with Uber.
p139
aVUber came out,
p140
aVincredible company, incredible business model,
p141
aVgreat execution, too.
p142
aVBut the timing was so perfect
p143
aVfor their need to get drivers into the system.
p144
aVDrivers were looking for extra money; it was very, very important.
p145
aa(lp146
VSome of our early successes, Citysearch, came out when people needed web pages.
p147
aVGoTo.com, which we announced actually at TED in 1998,
p148
aVwas when companies were looking for cost-effective ways to get traffic.
p149
aVWe thought the idea was so great,
p150
aVbut actually, the timing was probably maybe more important.
p151
aVAnd then some of our failures.
p152
aVWe started a company called Z.com, it was an online entertainment company.
p153
aVWe were so excited about it \u2014
p154
aVwe raised enough money, we had a great business model,
p155
aVwe even signed incredibly great Hollywood talent to join the company.
p156
aVBut broadband penetration was too low in 1999-2000.
p157
aVIt was too hard to watch video content online,
p158
aVyou had to put codecs in your browser and do all this stuff,
p159
aVand the company eventually went out of business in 2003.
p160
aa(lp161
VJust two years later,
p162
aVwhen the codec problem was solved by Adobe Flash
p163
aVand when broadband penetration crossed 50 percent in America,
p164
aVYouTube was perfectly timed.
p165
aVGreat idea, but unbelievable timing.
p166
aVIn fact, YouTube didn't even have a business model when it first started.
p167
aVIt wasn't even certain that  that would work out.
p168
aVBut that was beautifully,  beautifully timed.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo what I would say, in summary,
p171
aVis execution definitely matters a lot.
p172
aVThe idea matters a lot.
p173
aVBut timing might matter even more.
p174
aVAnd the best way to really assess timing
p175
aVis to really look at whether  consumers are really ready
p176
aVfor what you have to offer them.
p177
aVAnd to be really, really honest about it,
p178
aVnot be in denial about any results that you see,
p179
aVbecause if you have something you love, you want to push it forward,
p180
aVbut you have to be very, very honest about that factor on timing.
p181
aa(lp182
VAs I said earlier,
p183
aVI think startups can change the world and make the world a better place.
p184
aVI hope some of these insights
p185
aVcan maybe help you have a slightly higher success ratio,
p186
aVand thus make something great come to the world
p187
aVthat wouldn't have happened otherwise.
p188
aa(lp189
VThank you very much, you've been a great audience.
