(lp3
VHi there. I'm Hasan. I'm an artist.
p4
aVAnd usually when I tell people I'm an artist,
p5
aVthey just look at me and say, "Do you paint?"
p6
aVor "What kind of medium do you work in?"
p7
aVWell most of my work that I work with
p8
aVis really a little bit about methodologies of working
p9
aVrather than actually a specific discipline
p10
aVor a specific technique.
p11
aVSo what I'm really interested in is creative problem solving.
p12
aVAnd I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago.
p13
aVSo let me show you a little of that.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo it started over here.
p16
aVAnd this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002.
p17
aVI was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas.
p18
aVAnd as I was coming back,
p19
aVwell I was taken by the FBI, met by an FBI agent,
p20
aVand went into a little room
p21
aVand he asked me all sorts of questions \u2014
p22
aV"Where were you? What were you doing? Who were you talking with?
p23
aVWhy were you there? Who pays for your trips?" \u2014
p24
aVall these little details.
p25
aVAnd then literally just out of nowhere,
p26
aVthe guy asks me, "Where were you September 12th?"
p27
aVAnd when most of us get asked, "Where were you September 12th?"
p28
aVor any date for that fact,
p29
aVit's like, "I don't exactly remember, but I can look it up for you."
p30
aa(lp31
VSo I pulled out my little PDA,
p32
aVand I said, "Okay, let's look up my appointments for September 12th."
p33
aVI had September 12th \u2014 from 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m., I paid my storage bill.
p34
aVFrom 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., I met with Judith who was one of my graduate students at the time.
p35
aVFrom 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., I taught my intro class,
p36
aV3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., I taught my advanced class.
p37
aV"Where were you the 11th?" "Where were you the 10th?"
p38
aV"Where were you the 29th? the 30th?"
p39
aV"Where were you October 5th?"
p40
aVWe read about six months of my calendar.
p41
aVAnd I don't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records
p42
aVof what I did.
p43
aVBut good thing I did,
p44
aVbecause I don't look good in orange.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VSo he asked me \u2014
p49
aV(Applause)
p50
aV"So this storage unit that you paid the rent on,
p51
aVwhat did you have in it?"
p52
aVThis was in Tampa, Florida,
p53
aVso I was like, "Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida.
p54
aVFurniture that I can't fit in my ratty apartment.
p55
aVJust assorted garage sale junk,
p56
aVbecause I'm a pack rat."
p57
aVAnd he looks at me really confused and says, "No explosives?"
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aVI was like, "No, no. I'm pretty certain there were no explosives.
p60
aVAnd if there were, I would have remembered that one."
p61
aVAnd he's still a little confused,
p62
aVbut I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes
p63
aVrealizes I'm not exactly a terrorist threat.
p64
aVAnd so we're sitting there,
p65
aVand eventually after about an hour, hour and a half of just going back and forth,
p66
aVhe says, "Okay, I have enough information here.
p67
aVI'm going to pass this onto the Tampa office. They're the ones who initiated this.
p68
aVThey'll follow up with you, and we'll take care of it."
p69
aVI was like, "Great."
p70
aa(lp71
VSo I got home and the phone rings,
p72
aVand a man introduced himself.
p73
aVBasically this is the FBI offices in Tampa
p74
aVwhere I spent six months of my life \u2014
p75
aVback and forth, not six months continuously.
p76
aVBy the way, you folks know that in the United States,
p77
aVyou can't take photographs of federal buildings,
p78
aVbut Google can do it for you.
p79
aVSo to the folks from Google, thank you.
p80
aV(Applause)
p81
aVSo I spent a lot of time in this building.
p82
aVQuestions like:
p83
aV"Have you ever witnessed or participated in any act
p84
aVthat may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation?"
p85
aVAnd you also have to consider the state of mind you're in
p86
aVwhen you're doing this.
p87
aVYou're basically face-to-face with someone
p88
aVthat essentially decides life or death.
p89
aVOr questions such as \u2014 actually, during the polygraph,
p90
aVwhich was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them \u2014
p91
aa(lp92
Vone of the polygraph questions was ...
p93
aVwell the first one was, "Is your name Hasan?" "Yes."
p94
aV"Are we in Florida?" "Yes." "Is today Tuesday?" "Yes."
p95
aVBecause you have to base it on a yes or no.
p96
aVThen, of course, the next question is:
p97
aV"Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?"
p98
aVI work at a university.
p99
aV(Laughter)
p100
aVSo I was like, "Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly."
p101
aVBut they said, "Okay, aside from what we had discussed,
p102
aVdo you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States?"
p103
aVI was like, "No."
p104
aa(lp105
VSo at the end of six months of this
p106
aVand nine consecutive polygraphs,
p107
aVthey said, "Hey, everything's fine."
p108
aVI was like, "I know. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys all along.
p109
aVI know everything's fine."
p110
aVSo they're looking at me really odd.
p111
aVAnd it's like, "Guys, I travel a lot."
p112
aVThis is with the FBI.
p113
aVAnd I was like, "All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo,
p114
aVand here we go all over again."
p115
aVAnd there was a sincere concern there.
p116
aVAnd he was like, "You know, if you get into trouble,
p117
aVgive us a call \u2014 we'll take care of it."
p118
aa(lp119
VSo ever since then, before I would go anywhere, I would call the FBI.
p120
aVI would tell them, "Hey guys, this is where I'm going. This is my flight.
p121
aVNorthwest flight seven coming into Seattle
p122
aVon March 12th" or whatever.
p123
aVA couple weeks later, I'd call again, let them know.
p124
aVIt wasn't that I had to, but I chose to.
p125
aVJust wanted to say, "Hey guys.
p126
aVDon't want to make it look like I'm making any sudden moves."
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aV"I don't want you guys to think that I'm about to flee.
p129
aVJust letting you know. Heads up."
p130
aVAnd so I just kept doing this over and over and over.
p131
aVAnd then the phone calls turned into emails,
p132
aVand the emails got longer and longer and longer ...
p133
aVwith pictures,
p134
aVwith travel tips.
p135
aVThen I'd make websites.
p136
aVAnd then I built this over here. Let me go back to it over here.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo I actually designed this back in 2003.
p139
aVSo this kind of tracks me at any given moment.
p140
aVI wrote some code for my mobile phone.
p141
aVBasically, what I decided is okay guys, you want to watch me, that's cool.
p142
aVBut I'll watch myself. It's okay.
p143
aVYou don't have to waste your energy or your resources.
p144
aVAnd I'll help you out.
p145
aVSo in the process, I start thinking, well what else might they know about me?
p146
aVWell they probably have all my flight records,
p147
aVso I decided to put all my flight records from birth online.
p148
aVSo you can see, Delta 1252
p149
aVgoing from Kansas City to Atlanta.
p150
aVAnd then you see, these are some of the meals that I've been fed on the planes.
p151
aVThis was on Delta 719
p152
aVgoing from JFK to San Francisco.
p153
aVSee that? They won't let me on a plane with that,
p154
aVbut they'll give it to me on the plane.
p155
aV(Laughter)
p156
aVThese are the airports that I hang out in,
p157
aVbecause I like airports.
p158
aVThat's Kennedy airport, May 19th, Tuesday.
p159
aVThis is in Warsaw.
p160
aVSingapore. You can see, they're kind of empty.
p161
aa(lp162
VThese images are shot really anonymously
p163
aVto the point where it could be anyone.
p164
aVBut if you can cross-reference this with the other data,
p165
aVthen you're basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent
p166
aVand putting it all together.
p167
aVAnd when you're in a situation
p168
aVwhere you have to justify every moment of your existence,
p169
aVyou're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner.
p170
aVAt the time that this was going on,
p171
aVthe last thing on my mind was "art project."
p172
aVI was certainly not thinking, hey, I got new work here.
p173
aVBut after going through this, after realizing, well what just happened?
p174
aVAnd after piecing together this, this and this,
p175
aVthis way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself
p176
aVeventually evolved into this,
p177
aVand it actually became this project.
p178
aa(lp179
VSo these are the stores that I shop in \u2014 some of them \u2014
p180
aVbecause they need to know.
p181
aVThis is me buying some duck flavored paste
p182
aVat the Ranch 99 in Daly City
p183
aVon Sunday, November 15th.
p184
aVAt Coreana Supermarket
p185
aVbuying my kimchi because I like kimchi.
p186
aVAnd I bought some crabs too right around there,
p187
aVand some chitlins at the Safeway in Emoryville.
p188
aVAnd laundry too. Laundry detergent at West Oakland \u2014
p189
aVEast Oakland, sorry.
p190
aVAnd then my pickled jellyfish
p191
aVat the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route 18 in East Brunswick.
p192
aVNow if you go to my bank records,
p193
aVit'll actually show something from there,
p194
aVso you know that, on May 9th,
p195
aVthat I bought $14.79 in fuel from Safeway Vallejo.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo not only that I'm giving this information here and there,
p198
aVbut now there's a third party,
p199
aVan independent third party, my bank,
p200
aVthat's verifying that, yes indeed, I was there at this time.
p201
aVSo there's points, and these points are actually being cross-referenced.
p202
aVAnd there's a verification taking place.
p203
aVSometimes they're really small purchases.
p204
aVSo 34 cents foreign transaction fee.
p205
aVAll of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts,
p206
aVand everything pops up right away.
p207
aa(lp208
VSometimes there's a lot of information.
p209
aVThis is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was.
p210
aVAnd then sometimes you get this.
p211
aVSometimes you just get this, just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City,
p212
aVJanuary 22nd.
p213
aVAnd I can tell you exactly who I was with, where I was,
p214
aVbecause this is what I had to do with the FBI.
p215
aVI had to tell them every little detail of everything.
p216
aVI spend a lot of time on the road.
p217
aVThis is a parking lot in Elko, Nevada
p218
aVoff of Route 80
p219
aVat 8:01 p.m. on August 19th.
p220
aVI spend a lot of time in gas stations too \u2014 empty train stations.
p221
aVSo there's multiple databases.
p222
aVAnd there's thousands and thousands and thousands of images.
p223
aVThere's actually 46,000 images right now on my site,
p224
aVand the FBI has seen all of them \u2014
p225
aVat least I trust they've seen all of them.
p226
aVAnd then sometimes you don't get much information at all,
p227
aVyou just get this empty bed.
p228
aVAnd sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information.
p229
aVSo you get something like this.
p230
aVThis, by the way, is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California \u2014
p231
aVVietnamese sandwich.
p232
aa(lp233
VSo there's different categorizations
p234
aVof meals eaten outside
p235
aVempty train stations, empty gas stations.
p236
aVThese are some of the meals that I've been cooking at home.
p237
aVSo how do you know these are meals eaten at home?
p238
aVWell the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times.
p239
aVSo again, you have to do some detective work here.
p240
aVSo sometimes the databases get so specific.
p241
aVThese are all tacos eaten in Mexico City
p242
aVnear a train station
p243
aVon July fifth to July sixth.
p244
aVAt 11:39 a.m. was this one.
p245
aVAt 1:56 p.m. was this one. At 4:59 p.m. was this one.
p246
aVSo I time-stamp my life every few moments.
p247
aVEvery few moments I shoot the image.
p248
aa(lp249
VNow it's all done on my iPhone,
p250
aVand it all goes straight up to my server,
p251
aVand my server does all the backend work
p252
aVand categorizes things and puts everything together.
p253
aVThey need to know where I'm doing my business,
p254
aVbecause they want to know about my business.
p255
aVSo on December 4th, I went here.
p256
aVAnd on Sunday, June 14th at 2009 \u2014
p257
aVthis was actually about two o'clock in the afternoon
p258
aVin Skowhegan, Maine \u2014 this was my apartment there.
p259
aVSo what you're basically seeing here
p260
aVis all bits and pieces and all this information.
p261
aa(lp262
VIf you go to my site, there's tons of things.
p263
aVAnd really, it's not the most user-friendly interface.
p264
aVIt's actually quite user-unfriendly.
p265
aVAnd one of the reasons, also being part of the user-unfriendliness,
p266
aVis that everything is there,
p267
aVbut you have to really work through it.
p268
aVSo by me putting all this information out there,
p269
aVwhat I'm basically telling you is I'm telling you everything.
p270
aVBut in this barrage of noise
p271
aVthat I'm putting out,
p272
aVI actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life.
p273
aVAnd you know very little about me actually.
p274
aVAnd really so I've come to the conclusion
p275
aVthat the way you protect your privacy,
p276
aVparticularly in an era where everything is cataloged
p277
aVand everything is archived and everything is recorded,
p278
aVthere's no need to delete information anymore.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo what do you do when everything is out there?
p281
aVWell you have to take control over it.
p282
aVAnd if I give you this information directly,
p283
aVit's a very different type of identity
p284
aVthan if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces.
p285
aVThe other thing that's also interesting that's going on here
p286
aVis the fact that intelligence agencies \u2014
p287
aVand it doesn't matter who they are \u2014
p288
aVthey all operate in an industry
p289
aVwhere their commodity is information,
p290
aVor restricted access to information.
p291
aVAnd the reason their information has any value
p292
aVis, well, because no one else has access to it.
p293
aVAnd by me cutting out the middle man
p294
aVand giving it straight to you,
p295
aVthe information that the FBI has has no value,
p296
aVso thus devaluing their currency.
p297
aVAnd I understand that, on an individual level,
p298
aVit's purely symbolic.
p299
aVBut if 300 million people in the U.S.
p300
aVstarted doing this,
p301
aVwe would have to redesign the entire intelligence system
p302
aVfrom the ground up.
p303
aVBecause it just wouldn't work if everybody was sharing everything.
p304
aVAnd we're getting to that.
p305
aa(lp306
VWhen I first started this project,
p307
aVpeople were looking at me and saying,
p308
aV"Why would you want to tell everybody what you're doing, where you're at?
p309
aVWhy are you posting these photos?"
p310
aVThis was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere
p311
aVand 750 million people
p312
aVwere posting status messages
p313
aVor poking people.
p314
aVSo in a way, I'm glad that I'm completely obsolete.
p315
aVI'm still doing this project, but it is obsolete,
p316
aVbecause you're all doing it.
p317
aVThis is something that we all are doing on a daily basis,
p318
aVwhether we're aware of it or not.
p319
aVSo we're creating our own archives and so on.
p320
aa(lp321
VAnd you know, some of my friends have always said,
p322
aV"Hey, you're just paranoid. Why are you doing this?
p323
aVBecause no one's really watching.
p324
aVNo one's really going to bother you."
p325
aVSo one of the things that I do
p326
aVis I actually look through my server logs very carefully.
p327
aVBecause it's about surveillance.
p328
aVI'm watching who's watching me.
p329
aVAnd I came up with these.
p330
aVSo these are some of my sample logs.
p331
aVAnd just little bits and pieces, and you can see some of the things there.
p332
aVAnd I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see.
p333
aVSo you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by \u2014
p334
aVDepartment of Homeland Security.
p335
aVYou can see the National Security Agency likes to come by.
p336
aVI actually moved very close to them. I live right down the street from them now.
p337
aVCentral Intelligence Agency.
p338
aVExecutive Office of the President.
p339
aVNot really sure why they show up, but they do.
p340
aVI think they kind of like to look at art.
p341
aVAnd I'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields.
p342
aa(lp343
VSo thank you very much. I appreciate it.
p344
aa(lp345
V(Applause)
p346
aa(lp347
VBruno Giussani: Hasan, just curious.
p348
aVYou said, "Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone,"
p349
aVbut actually you do take the pictures and put on information.
p350
aVSo how many hours of the day does that take?
p351
aa(lp352
VHE: Almost none.
p353
aVIt's no different
p354
aVthan sending a text.
p355
aVIt's no different than checking an email.
p356
aVIt's one of those things, we got by just fine before we had to do any of those.
p357
aVSo it's just become another day.
p358
aVI mean, when we update a status message,
p359
aVwe don't really think about how long that's going to take.
p360
aVSo it's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks,
p361
aVsend, and then it's done.
p362
aVAnd everything's automated at the other end.
p363
aa(lp364
VBG: On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage, the FBI gets crazy?
p365
aa(lp366
VHE: Well it goes to the last point that I was at.
p367
aVSo it holds onto the very last point.
p368
aVSo if I'm on a 12-hour flight,
p369
aVyou'll see the last airport that I departed from.
p370
aa(lp371
VBG: Hasan, thank you very much. (HE: Thank you.)
p372
aa(lp373
