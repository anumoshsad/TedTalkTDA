VSo, how many of you have ever
p4
aVgotten behind the wheel of a car
p5
aVwhen you really shouldn't have been driving?
p6
aVMaybe you're out on the road for a long day,
p7
aVand you just wanted to get home.
p8
aVYou were tired, but you felt you could drive a few more miles.
p9
aVMaybe you thought,
p10
aVI've had less to drink than everybody else,
p11
aVI should be the one to go home.
p12
aVOr maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere.
p13
aa(lp14
VDoes this sound familiar to you?
p15
aVNow, in those situations, wouldn't it be great
p16
aVif there was a button on your dashboard
p17
aVthat you could push, and the car would get you home safely?
p18
aVNow, that's been the promise of the self-driving car,
p19
aVthe autonomous vehicle, and it's been the dream
p20
aVsince at least 1939, when General Motors showcased
p21
aVthis idea at their Futurama booth at the World's Fair.
p22
aa(lp23
VNow, it's been one of those dreams
p24
aVthat's always seemed about 20 years in the future.
p25
aVNow, two weeks ago, that dream took a step forward,
p26
aVwhen the state of Nevada granted Google's self-driving car
p27
aVthe very first license for an autonomous vehicle,
p28
aVclearly establishing that it's legal for them
p29
aVto test it on the roads in Nevada.
p30
aVNow, California's considering similar legislation,
p31
aVand this would make sure that the autonomous car
p32
aVis not one of those things that has to stay in Vegas.
p33
aa(lp34
V(Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VNow, in my lab at Stanford, we've been working on
p37
aVautonomous cars too, but with a slightly different spin
p38
aVon things. You see, we've been developing robotic race cars,
p39
aVcars that can actually push themselves to the very limits
p40
aVof physical performance.
p41
aa(lp42
VNow, why would we want to do such a thing?
p43
aVWell, there's two really good reasons for this.
p44
aVFirst, we believe that before people turn over control
p45
aVto an autonomous car, that autonomous car should be
p46
aVat least as good as the very best human drivers.
p47
aVNow, if you're like me, and the other 70 percent of the population
p48
aVwho know that we are above-average drivers,
p49
aVyou understand that's a very high bar.
p50
aVThere's another reason as well.
p51
aVJust like race car drivers can use all of the friction
p52
aVbetween the tire and the road,
p53
aVall of the car's capabilities to go as fast as possible,
p54
aVwe want to use all of those capabilities to avoid
p55
aVany accident we can.
p56
aa(lp57
VNow, you may push the car to the limits
p58
aVnot because you're driving too fast,
p59
aVbut because you've hit an icy patch of road,
p60
aVconditions have changed.
p61
aVIn those situations, we want a car
p62
aVthat is capable enough to avoid any accident
p63
aVthat can physically be avoided.
p64
aa(lp65
VI must confess, there's kind of a third motivation as well.
p66
aVYou see, I have a passion for racing.
p67
aVIn the past, I've been a race car owner,
p68
aVa crew chief and a driving coach,
p69
aValthough maybe not at the level that you're currently expecting.
p70
aVOne of the things that we've developed in the lab \u2014
p71
aVwe've developed several vehicles \u2014
p72
aVis what we believe is the world's first
p73
aVautonomously drifting car.
p74
aVIt's another one of those categories
p75
aVwhere maybe there's not a lot of competition.
p76
aa(lp77
V(Laughter)
p78
aa(lp79
VBut this is P1. It's an entirely student-built electric vehicle,
p80
aVwhich through using its rear-wheel drive
p81
aVand front-wheel steer-by-wire
p82
aVcan drift around corners.
p83
aVIt can get sideways like a rally car driver,
p84
aValways able to take the tightest curve,
p85
aVeven on slippery, changing surfaces,
p86
aVnever spinning out.
p87
aa(lp88
VWe've also worked with Volkswagen Oracle,
p89
aVon Shelley, an autonomous race car that has raced
p90
aVat 150 miles an hour through the Bonneville Salt Flats,
p91
aVgone around Thunderhill Raceway Park in the sun,
p92
aVthe wind and the rain,
p93
aVand navigated the 153 turns and 12.4 miles
p94
aVof the Pikes Peak Hill Climb route
p95
aVin Colorado with nobody at the wheel.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
V(Applause)
p100
aa(lp101
VI guess it goes without saying that we've had a lot of fun
p102
aVdoing this.
p103
aVBut in fact, there's something else that we've developed
p104
aVin the process of developing these autonomous cars.
p105
aVWe have developed a tremendous appreciation
p106
aVfor the capabilities of human race car drivers.
p107
aVAs we've looked at the question of how well do these cars perform,
p108
aVwe wanted to compare them to our human counterparts.
p109
aVAnd we discovered their human counterparts are amazing.
p110
aVNow, we can take a map of a race track,
p111
aVwe can take a mathematical model of a car,
p112
aVand with some iteration, we can actually find
p113
aVthe fastest way around that track.
p114
aVWe line that up with data that we record
p115
aVfrom a professional driver,
p116
aVand the resemblance is absolutely remarkable.
p117
aa(lp118
VYes, there are subtle differences here,
p119
aVbut the human race car driver is able to go out
p120
aVand drive an amazingly fast line,
p121
aVwithout the benefit of an algorithm that compares
p122
aVthe trade-off between going as fast as possible
p123
aVin this corner, and shaving a little bit of time
p124
aVoff of the straight over here.
p125
aVNot only that, they're able to do it lap
p126
aVafter lap after lap.
p127
aVThey're able to go out and consistently do this,
p128
aVpushing the car to the limits every single time.
p129
aVIt's extraordinary to watch.
p130
aVYou put them in a new car,
p131
aVand after a few laps, they've found the fastest line in that car,
p132
aVand they're off to the races.
p133
aa(lp134
VIt really makes you think,
p135
aVwe'd love to know what's going on inside their brain.
p136
aVSo as researchers, that's what we decided to find out.
p137
aVWe decided to instrument not only the car,
p138
aVbut also the race car driver,
p139
aVto try to get a glimpse into what was going on
p140
aVin their head as they were doing this.
p141
aVNow, this is Dr. Lene Harbott applying electrodes
p142
aVto the head of John Morton.
p143
aVJohn Morton is a former Can-Am and IMSA driver,
p144
aVwho's also a class champion at Le Mans.
p145
aVFantastic driver, and very willing to put up with graduate students
p146
aVand this sort of research.
p147
aVShe's putting electrodes on his head
p148
aVso that we can monitor the electrical activity
p149
aVin John's brain as he races around the track.
p150
aa(lp151
VNow, clearly we're not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head
p152
aVand understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track.
p153
aVHowever, neuroscientists have identified certain patterns
p154
aVthat let us tease out some very important aspects of this.
p155
aVFor instance, the resting brain
p156
aVtends to generate a lot of alpha waves.
p157
aVIn contrast, theta waves are associated with
p158
aVa lot of cognitive activity, like visual processing,
p159
aVthings where the driver is thinking quite a bit.
p160
aVNow, we can measure this,
p161
aVand we can look at the relative power
p162
aVbetween the theta waves and the alpha waves.
p163
aVThis gives us a measure of mental workload,
p164
aVhow much the driver is actually challenged cognitively
p165
aVat any point along the track.
p166
aa(lp167
VNow, we wanted to see if we could actually record this
p168
aVon the track, so we headed down south to Laguna Seca.
p169
aVLaguna Seca is a legendary raceway
p170
aVabout halfway between Salinas and Monterey.
p171
aVIt has a curve there called the Corkscrew.
p172
aVNow, the Corkscrew is a chicane, followed by a quick
p173
aVright-handed turn as the road drops three stories.
p174
aVNow, the strategy for driving this as explained to me was,
p175
aVyou aim for the bush in the distance,
p176
aVand as the road falls away, you realize it was actually the top of a tree.
p177
aa(lp178
VAll right, so thanks to the Revs Program at Stanford,
p179
aVwe were able to take John there
p180
aVand put him behind the wheel
p181
aVof a 1960 Porsche Abarth Carrera.
p182
aVLife is way too short for boring cars.
p183
aVSo, here you see John on the track,
p184
aVhe's going up the hill \u2014 Oh! Somebody liked that \u2014
p185
aVand you can see, actually, his mental workload
p186
aV\u2014 measuring here in the red bar \u2014
p187
aVyou can see his actions as he approaches.
p188
aVNow watch, he has to downshift.
p189
aVAnd then he has to turn left.
p190
aVLook for the tree, and down.
p191
aa(lp192
VNot surprisingly, you can see this is a pretty challenging task.
p193
aVYou can see his mental workload spike as he goes through this,
p194
aVas you would expect with something that requires
p195
aVthis level of complexity.
p196
aVBut what's really interesting is to look at areas of the track
p197
aVwhere his mental workload doesn't increase.
p198
aVI'm going to take you around now
p199
aVto the other side of the track.
p200
aVTurn three. And John's going to go into that corner
p201
aVand the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out.
p202
aVHe's going to have to correct for that with steering.
p203
aVSo watch as John does this here.
p204
aVWatch the mental workload, and watch the steering.
p205
aVThe car begins to slide out, dramatic maneuver to correct it,
p206
aVand no change whatsoever in the mental workload.
p207
aVNot a challenging task.
p208
aVIn fact, entirely reflexive.
p209
aa(lp210
VNow, our data processing on this is still preliminary,
p211
aVbut it really seems that these phenomenal feats
p212
aVthat the race car drivers are performing
p213
aVare instinctive.
p214
aVThey are things that they have simply learned to do.
p215
aVIt requires very little mental workload
p216
aVfor them to perform these amazing feats.
p217
aVAnd their actions are fantastic.
p218
aVThis is exactly what you want to do on the steering wheel
p219
aVto catch the car in this situation.
p220
aa(lp221
VNow, this has given us tremendous insight
p222
aVand inspiration for our own autonomous vehicles.
p223
aVWe've started to ask the question:
p224
aVCan we make them a little less algorithmic
p225
aVand a little more intuitive?
p226
aVCan we take this reflexive action
p227
aVthat we see from the very best race car drivers,
p228
aVintroduce it to our cars,
p229
aVand maybe even into a system that could
p230
aVget onto your car in the future?
p231
aVThat would take us a long step
p232
aValong the road to autonomous vehicles
p233
aVthat drive as well as the best humans.
p234
aa(lp235
VBut it's made us think a little bit more deeply as well.
p236
aVDo we want something more from our car
p237
aVthan to simply be a chauffeur?
p238
aVDo we want our car to perhaps be a partner, a coach,
p239
aVsomeone that can use their understanding of the situation
p240
aVto help us reach our potential?
p241
aVCan, in fact, the technology not simply replace humans,
p242
aVbut allow us to reach the level of reflex and intuition
p243
aVthat we're all capable of?
p244
aa(lp245
VSo, as we move forward into this technological future,
p246
aVI want you to just pause and think of that for a moment.
p247
aVWhat is the ideal balance of human and machine?
p248
aVAnd as we think about that,
p249
aVlet's take inspiration
p250
aVfrom the absolutely amazing capabilities
p251
aVof the human body and the human mind.
p252
aa(lp253
