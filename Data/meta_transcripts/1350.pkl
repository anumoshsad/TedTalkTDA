VWhat I want to talk to you about today
p4
aVis some of the problems that the military of the Western world \u2014
p5
aVAustralia, United States, the UK and so on \u2014
p6
aVface in some of the deployments that they're dealing with
p7
aVin the modern world at this time.
p8
aVIf you think about the sorts of things
p9
aVwe've sent Australian military personnel to in recent years,
p10
aVwe've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan,
p11
aVbut you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands,
p12
aVand so on.
p13
aa(lp14
VAnd a lot of these deployments
p15
aVthat we're sending military personnel to these days
p16
aVaren't traditional wars.
p17
aVIn fact, a lot of the jobs we're asking military personnel to do
p18
aVin those situations
p19
aVare ones that, in their own countries \u2014 Australia, the US and so on \u2014
p20
aVwould actually be done by police officers.
p21
aVSo there's a bunch of problems that come up
p22
aVfor military personnel in these situations,
p23
aVbecause they're doing things they haven't really been trained for.
p24
aVAnd they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries
p25
aVare trained very differently for and equipped very differently for.
p26
aa(lp27
VNow, there's a bunch of reasons why we send military personnel,
p28
aVrather than police, to do these jobs.
p29
aVIf Australia had to send 1,000 people tomorrow
p30
aVto West Papua, for example,
p31
aVwe don't have 1,000 police officers hanging around that could go tomorrow,
p32
aVand we do have 1,000 soldiers that could go.
p33
aVSo when we have to send someone, we send the military \u2014
p34
aVthey're there, they're available,
p35
aVand heck, they're used to going off and doing these things
p36
aVand living by themselves
p37
aVand not having all this extra support.
p38
aVSo they are able to do it in that sense.
p39
aVBut they aren't trained the same way police officers are,
p40
aVand they're certainly not equipped the way police officers are,
p41
aVso this has raised a bunch of problems for them
p42
aVwhen dealing with these issues.
p43
aa(lp44
VOne particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in,
p45
aVis the question of whether,
p46
aVwhen we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs,
p47
aVwe ought to be equipping them differently;
p48
aVand in particular, whether we ought to be giving them access
p49
aVto some of the nonlethal weapons that police have.
p50
aVSince they're doing some of the same jobs,
p51
aVmaybe they should have some of those things.
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd there's a range of places you'd think those things would be really useful.
p54
aVFor example, when you've got military checkpoints.
p55
aVIf people are approaching these checkpoints
p56
aVand the military personnel are unsure if this person's hostile or not,
p57
aVsay this person approaching here, and they say,
p58
aV"Is this a suicide bomber or not?
p59
aVIs something hidden under their clothes?
p60
aVWhat's going to happen?"
p61
aVThey don't know if the person is hostile or not.
p62
aVIf the person doesn't follow directions, they may end up shooting them,
p63
aVand then find out afterwards either, yes, we shot the right person,
p64
aVor, no, this was just an innocent person
p65
aVwho didn't understand what was going on.
p66
aVSo if they had nonlethal weapons, then they would say,
p67
aV"We can use them in that sort of situation.
p68
aVIf we shoot someone who wasn't hostile,
p69
aVat least we haven't killed them."
p70
aa(lp71
VAnother situation: this photo is from one of the missions
p72
aVin the Balkans in the late 1990s.
p73
aVThis situation is a little bit different,
p74
aVwhere maybe they know someone is hostile;
p75
aVthey've got someone shooting at them
p76
aVor doing something else that's clearly hostile,
p77
aVthrowing rocks, whatever.
p78
aVBut if they respond,
p79
aVthere's a range of other people around who are innocent people,
p80
aVwho might also get hurt.
p81
aVIt'd be collateral damage
p82
aVthat the military often doesn't want to talk about.
p83
aVSo again, they'd say, "With access to nonlethal weapons,
p84
aVif we've got someone we know is hostile,
p85
aVwe can do something to deal with them,
p86
aVand know that if we hit anyone else,
p87
aVat least we're not going to kill them."
p88
aa(lp89
VAnother suggestion has been,
p90
aVsince we're putting so many robots in the field,
p91
aVwe can see the time coming
p92
aVwhere they're actually going to send robots out in the field
p93
aVthat are autonomous.
p94
aVThey'll make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot,
p95
aVwithout a human in the loop.
p96
aVSo the suggestion is,
p97
aVif we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this,
p98
aVmaybe it would be a good idea if they were armed with nonlethal weapons,
p99
aVso if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person,
p100
aVagain, they haven't actually killed them.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, there's a whole range of different sorts of nonlethal weapons,
p103
aVsome of which are available now,
p104
aVsome of which they're developing.
p105
aVYou've got traditional things like pepper spray,
p106
aVOC spray up at the top there,
p107
aVor Tasers over here.
p108
aVThe one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser,
p109
aVintended to just blind the person momentarily
p110
aVand disorient them.
p111
aVYou've got nonlethal shotgun rounds
p112
aVthat contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones.
p113
aVAnd this one in the middle here, the large truck,
p114
aVis called the Active Denial System,
p115
aVsomething the US military is working on at the moment.
p116
aa(lp117
VIt's essentially a big microwave transmitter.
p118
aVIt's sort of your classic idea of a heat ray.
p119
aVIt goes out to a really long distance,
p120
aVcompared to any of these other sorts of things.
p121
aVAnybody who is hit with this feels a sudden burst of heat,
p122
aVand just wants to get out of the way.
p123
aVIt is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven,
p124
aVbut it basically is boiling the water molecules
p125
aVin the very surface level of your skin.
p126
aVSo you feel this massive heat,
p127
aVand you go, "I want to get out of the way."
p128
aVAnd they think this will be really useful
p129
aVin places where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area,
p130
aVif the crowd is being hostile.
p131
aVIf we need to keep people away from a particular place,
p132
aVwe can do that with these sorts of things.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo there's a whole range of different nonlethal weapons
p135
aVwe could give military personnel,
p136
aVand there's a whole range of situations
p137
aVwhere they're looking at them and saying,
p138
aV"These things would be really useful."
p139
aVBut as I said,
p140
aVthe military and the police are very different.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VYes, you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize
p145
aVthat they might be very different.
p146
aVIn particular,
p147
aVthe attitude to the use of force
p148
aVand the way they're trained to use force
p149
aVis especially different.
p150
aa(lp151
VThe police \u2014
p152
aVand knowing because I've actually helped to train police \u2014
p153
aVpolice, particularly in Western jurisdictions at least,
p154
aVare trained to De-escalate force,
p155
aVto try and avoid using force wherever possible,
p156
aVand to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort.
p157
aVMilitary personnel are being trained for war.
p158
aVSo they're trained that, as soon as things go bad,
p159
aVtheir first response is lethal force.
p160
aVThe moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine \u2014
p161
aa(lp162
V(Laughter)
p163
aa(lp164
Vyou can start shooting at people.
p165
aVSo their attitudes
p166
aVto the use of lethal force are very different,
p167
aVand I think it's fairly obvious
p168
aVthat their attitude to the use of nonlethal weapons
p169
aVwould also be very different from what it is with the police.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd since we've already had so many problems
p172
aVwith police use of nonlethal weapons in various ways,
p173
aVI thought it would be a good idea to look at some of those things
p174
aVand relate it to the military context.
p175
aVI was very surprised when I started to do this to see that, in fact,
p176
aVeven the people who advocated the use of nonlethal weapons by the military
p177
aVhadn't actually done that.
p178
aVThey generally seemed to think,
p179
aV"Why would we care what's happened with the police?
p180
aVWe're looking at something different,"
p181
aVand didn't seem to recognize
p182
aVthey were looking at pretty much the same stuff.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo I started to investigate some of those issues,
p185
aVand have a look at the way police use nonlethal weapons
p186
aVwhen they're introduced,
p187
aVand some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things
p188
aVwhen they actually do introduce them.
p189
aVAnd of course, being Australian,
p190
aVI started looking at stuff in Australia, knowing from my own experience
p191
aVof various times when nonlethal weapons have been introduced in Australia.
p192
aa(lp193
VOne of the things I particularly looked at was the use of OC spray \u2014
p194
aVoleoresin capsicum spray, pepper spray \u2014
p195
aVby Australian police,
p196
aVand seeing what had happened when that had been introduced,
p197
aVand those sorts of issues.
p198
aVAnd one study that I found, a particularly interesting one,
p199
aVwas in Queensland,
p200
aVbecause they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray
p201
aVbefore they actually introduced it more broadly.
p202
aVAnd I went and had a look at some of the figures here.
p203
aVNow, when they introduced OC spray in Queensland,
p204
aVthey were really explicit.
p205
aVThe police minister's and a heap of public statements were made about it.
p206
aVThey were saying, "This is explicitly intended to give police an option
p207
aVbetween shouting and shooting.
p208
aVThis is something they can use instead of a firearm
p209
aVin situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone."
p210
aa(lp211
VSo I looked at all of the police shooting figures.
p212
aVAnd you can't actually find them very easily
p213
aVfor individual Australian states;
p214
aVI could only find these.
p215
aVThis is from an Australian Institute of Criminology report.
p216
aVYou can see, in the fine print at the top:
p217
aV"Police shooting deaths" means not just people shot by police,
p218
aVbut people who have shot themselves in the presence of police.
p219
aVBut these are the figures across the entire country,
p220
aVand the red arrow represents the point where Queensland said,
p221
aV"Yes, this is where we're going to give
p222
aVall police officers across the entire state
p223
aVaccess to OC spray."
p224
aVSo you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it,
p225
aVevery year for a number of years.
p226
aVThere was a spike a few years before,
p227
aVbut that wasn't actually Queensland.
p228
aVAnyone know where that was?
p229
aVWasn't Port Arthur, no.
p230
aVVictoria? Yes, correct.
p231
aVThat spike was all Victoria.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Laughter)
p234
aa(lp235
VSo it wasn't that Queensland had a particular problem
p236
aVwith deaths from police shootings and so on.
p237
aVSo, six shootings across the whole country,
p238
aVfairly consistently over the years before.
p239
aa(lp240
VThe next two years were the years they studied \u2014 2001, 2002.
p241
aVAnyone want to take a stab at the number of times,
p242
aVgiven how they've introduced this,
p243
aVthe number of times police in Queensland used OC spray in that period?
p244
aVHundreds? One? Three?
p245
aVA thousand is getting better.
p246
aVExplicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force \u2014
p247
aVan alternative between shouting and shooting.
p248
aVI'm going to go out on a limb here
p249
aVand say that if Queensland police didn't have OC spray,
p250
aVthey wouldn't have shot 2,226 people
p251
aVin those two years.
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
VIn fact, if you have a look at the studies they were looking at,
p256
aVthe material they were collecting and examining,
p257
aVyou can see the suspects were only armed in about 15 percent of cases
p258
aVwhere OC spray was used.
p259
aa(lp260
VIt was routinely being used in this period,
p261
aVand, of course, still is routinely used \u2014
p262
aVbecause there were no complaints about it,
p263
aVnot within the context of this study, anyway \u2014
p264
aVit was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent,
p265
aVwho were potentially violent,
p266
aVand also quite frequently used
p267
aVto deal with people who were simply passively noncompliant.
p268
aVThis person is not doing anything violent,
p269
aVbut they just won't do what we want them to.
p270
aVThey're not obeying the directions we're giving them,
p271
aVso we'll give them a shot of the OC spray \u2014 that'll speed them up.
p272
aVEverything will work out better that way.
p273
aVThis was something explicitly introduced
p274
aVto be an alternative to firearms,
p275
aVbut it's being routinely used
p276
aVto deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems.
p277
aa(lp278
VNow one of the particular issues that comes up
p279
aVwith military use of nonlethal weapons \u2014
p280
aVand people actually say, "There might be some problems" \u2014
p281
aVthere's a couple of particular problems that get focused on.
p282
aVOne of those problems is: nonlethal weapons may be used indiscriminately.
p283
aVOne of the fundamental principles of military use of force
p284
aVis that you have to be discriminate;
p285
aVyou have to be careful about who you're shooting at.
p286
aVSo one of the problems suggested with nonlethal weapons
p287
aVis that they might be used indiscriminately \u2014
p288
aVthat you would use them against a whole range of people,
p289
aVbecause you don't have to worry so much anymore.
p290
aa(lp291
VAnd in fact, one particular instance where I think that actually happens
p292
aVwas the Dubrovka Theater siege in Moscow in 2002,
p293
aVwhich probably a lot of you, unlike most of my students at ADFA,
p294
aVare old enough to remember.
p295
aVSo, Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater.
p296
aVThey were holding something like 700 people hostage.
p297
aVThey'd released a bunch of people,
p298
aVbut they still had about 700 people hostage.
p299
aVAnd the Russian military police special forces, "Spetsnaz,"
p300
aVcame in and stormed the theater.
p301
aVThe way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anesthetic gas.
p302
aVAnd it turned out that lots of the hostages died
p303
aVas a result of inhaling the gas.
p304
aVIt was used indiscriminately.
p305
aVThey pumped the whole theater full of the gas.
p306
aa(lp307
VAnd it's no surprise that people died,
p308
aVbecause you don't know how much gas each person is going to inhale,
p309
aVwhat position they'll fall in when they become unconscious, and so on.
p310
aVThere were, in fact, only a couple of people who got shot
p311
aVin this episode.
p312
aVSo when they had a look at it afterward,
p313
aVthere were only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot,
p314
aVby the hostage takers or by the police forces
p315
aVtrying to deal with the situation.
p316
aVVirtually everybody that got killed
p317
aVgot killed from inhaling the gas.
p318
aVThe final toll of hostages is a little unclear,
p319
aVbut it's certainly a few more than that,
p320
aVbecause other people died over the next few days.
p321
aVSo this was one problem they talked about,
p322
aVthat it might be used indiscriminately.
p323
aa(lp324
VA second problem people sometimes talk about
p325
aVwith military use of nonlethal weapons \u2014
p326
aVand it's actually why, in the chemical weapons convention,
p327
aVit's very clear that you can't use riot-control agents
p328
aVas weapons of warfare \u2014
p329
aVis that it's seen that sometimes nonlethal weapons might be used
p330
aVnot as an alternative to lethal force,
p331
aVbut as a lethal force multiplier:
p332
aVthat you use nonlethal weapons first,
p333
aVso your lethal weapons will actually be more effective.
p334
aVThe people you'll be shooting at won't be able to get out of the way.
p335
aVThey won't be aware of what's happening, and you can kill them better.
p336
aVAnd that's exactly what happened here.
p337
aVThe hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas
p338
aVwere not taken into custody;
p339
aVthey were simply shot in the head.
p340
aVSo this nonlethal weapon was being used in this case
p341
aVas a lethal force multiplier,
p342
aVto make killing more effective in this particular situation.
p343
aa(lp344
VAnother problem I want to quickly mention
p345
aVis that there's a whole heap of problems
p346
aVwith the way people are actually taught to use nonlethal weapons,
p347
aVand get trained about them and then tested and so on.
p348
aVBecause they're tested in nice, safe environments,
p349
aVand are taught to use them in nice, safe environments \u2014
p350
aVlike this, where you can see exactly what's going on.
p351
aVThe person spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove
p352
aVto make sure they don't get contaminated, and so on.
p353
aVBut they're never used like that.
p354
aa(lp355
VThey're used out in the real world,
p356
aVlike in Texas, like this:
p357
aa(lp358
V["Police Taser Great-Grandmother During Traffic Stop"]
p359
aa(lp360
VI confess, this particular case was one that piqued my interest in this.
p361
aVIt happened while I was working as a research fellow
p362
aVat the US Naval Academy.
p363
aVNews reports started coming up about this situation,
p364
aVwhere this woman was arguing with a police officer.
p365
aVShe wasn't violent.
p366
aVIn fact, he was probably six inches taller than me,
p367
aVand she was about this tall.
p368
aVAnd eventually she said to him,
p369
aV"Well, I'm going to get back in my car."
p370
aVAnd he says, "If you get back in your car, I'm going to tase you."
p371
aVAnd she says, "Oh, go ahead. Tase me." And so he does.
p372
aVAnd it's all captured by the video camera
p373
aVrunning in the front of the police car.
p374
aVSo, she's 72.
p375
aVAnd it's seen that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with her.
p376
aa(lp377
VAnd there are other examples of the same sorts of things,
p378
aVwhere you think,
p379
aV"Is this really an appropriate way to use nonlethal weapons?"
p380
aV"Police Chief Fires Taser into 14 year old Girl's Head."
p381
aV"She was running away. What else was I suppose to do?"
p382
aa(lp383
V(Laughter)
p384
aa(lp385
VOr Florida:
p386
aV"Police Taser 6-year-old Boy at Elementary School."
p387
aVAnd they clearly learned a lot from it, because in the same district:
p388
aV"Police Review Policy After Children Shocked:
p389
aV2nd Child Shocked by Taser Stun Gun Within Weeks."
p390
aVSame police district.
p391
aVAnother child within weeks of Tasering the six-year-old boy.
p392
aa(lp393
VJust in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States,
p394
aVit happened in Canada as well:
p395
aa(lp396
V["Mounties Zap 11-year-old Boy"]
p397
aa(lp398
VAnd a colleague sent me this one from London:
p399
aa(lp400
V["Arrested Man, 82, Shot with Taser"]
p401
aa(lp402
VBut my personal favorite, I have to confess, does come from the US:
p403
aV"Officers Taser 86-year-old Disabled Woman in her Bed."
p404
aa(lp405
V(Laughter)
p406
aa(lp407
VI checked the reports on this one.
p408
aVI looked at it. I was really surprised.
p409
aVApparently, she took up a more threatening position in her bed.
p410
aa(lp411
V(Laughter)
p412
aa(lp413
VI kid you not, that's exactly what it said:
p414
aV"She took up a more threatening position in her bed."
p415
aVOK.
p416
aa(lp417
VBut I'd remind you \u2014
p418
aVI'm talking about military uses of nonlethal weapons,
p419
aVso why is this relevant?
p420
aVBecause police are actually more restrained in the use of force
p421
aVthan the military are.
p422
aVThey're trained to be more restrained in the use of force
p423
aVthan the military are.
p424
aVThey're trained to think more, to try and De-escalate.
p425
aVSo if you have these problems with police officers
p426
aVwith nonlethal weapons,
p427
aVwhat on earth would make you think
p428
aVit's going to be better with military personnel?
p429
aa(lp430
VThe last thing that I would like to say:
p431
aVWhen I'm talking to the police
p432
aVabout what a perfect nonlethal weapon would look like,
p433
aVthey almost inevitably say the same thing.
p434
aVThey say, "It's got to be something that's nasty enough
p435
aVthat people don't want to be hit with this weapon.
p436
aVSo if you threaten to use it,
p437
aVpeople are going to comply with it.
p438
aVBut it's also going to be something
p439
aVthat doesn't leave any lasting effects."
p440
aVIn other words,
p441
