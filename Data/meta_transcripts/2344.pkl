VTwo twin domes,
p4
aVtwo radically opposed design cultures.
p5
aVOne is made of thousands of steel parts,
p6
aVthe other of a single silk thread.
p7
aVOne is synthetic, the other organic.
p8
aVOne is imposed on the environment,
p9
aVthe other creates it.
p10
aVOne is designed for nature, the other is designed by her.
p11
aa(lp12
VMichelangelo said that when he looked at raw marble,
p13
aVhe saw a figure struggling to be free.
p14
aVThe chisel was Michelangelo's only tool.
p15
aVBut living things are not chiseled.
p16
aVThey grow.
p17
aVAnd in our smallest units of life, our cells, we carry all the information
p18
aVthat's required for every other cell to function and to replicate.
p19
aa(lp20
VTools also have consequences.
p21
aVAt least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated
p22
aVby the rigors of manufacturing and mass production.
p23
aVAssembly lines have dictated a world made of parts,
p24
aVframing the imagination of designers and architects
p25
aVwho have been trained to think about their objects as assemblies
p26
aVof discrete parts with distinct functions.
p27
aa(lp28
VBut you don't find homogenous material assemblies in nature.
p29
aVTake human skin, for example.
p30
aVOur facial skins are thin with large pores.
p31
aVOur back skins are thicker, with small pores.
p32
aVOne acts mainly as filter,
p33
aVthe other mainly as barrier,
p34
aVand yet it's the same skin: no parts, no assemblies.
p35
aVIt's a system that gradually varies its functionality
p36
aVby varying elasticity.
p37
aVSo here this is a split screen to represent my split world view,
p38
aVthe split personality of every designer and architect operating today
p39
aVbetween the chisel and the gene,
p40
aVbetween machine and organism, between assembly and growth,
p41
aVbetween Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
p42
aVThese two worldviews, my left brain and right brain,
p43
aVanalysis and synthesis, will play out on the two screens behind me.
p44
aVMy work, at its simplest level,
p45
aVis about uniting these two worldviews,
p46
aVmoving away from assembly
p47
aVand closer into growth.
p48
aa(lp49
VYou're probably asking yourselves:
p50
aVWhy now?
p51
aVWhy was this not possible 10 or even five years ago?
p52
aVWe live in a very special time in history,
p53
aVa rare time,
p54
aVa time when the confluence of four fields is giving designers access to tools
p55
aVwe've never had access to before.
p56
aVThese fields are computational design,
p57
aVallowing us to design complex forms with simple code;
p58
aVadditive manufacturing, letting us produce parts
p59
aVby adding material rather than carving it out;
p60
aVmaterials engineering, which lets us design the behavior of materials
p61
aVin high resolution;
p62
aVand synthetic biology,
p63
aVenabling us to design new biological functionality by editing DNA.
p64
aVAnd at the intersection of these four fields,
p65
aVmy team and I create.
p66
aVPlease meet the minds and hands
p67
aVof my students.
p68
aa(lp69
VWe design objects and products and structures and tools across scales,
p70
aVfrom the large-scale,
p71
aVlike this robotic arm with an 80-foot diameter reach
p72
aVwith a vehicular base that will one day soon print entire buildings,
p73
aVto nanoscale graphics made entirely of genetically engineered microorganisms
p74
aVthat glow in the dark.
p75
aVHere we've reimagined the mashrabiya,
p76
aVan archetype of ancient Arabic architecture,
p77
aVand created a screen where every aperture is uniquely sized
p78
aVto shape the form of light and heat moving through it.
p79
aa(lp80
VIn our next project,
p81
aVwe explore the possibility of creating a cape and skirt \u2014
p82
aVthis was for a Paris fashion show with Iris van Herpen \u2014
p83
aVlike a second skin that are made of a single part,
p84
aVstiff at the contours, flexible around the waist.
p85
aVTogether with my long-term 3D printing collaborator Stratasys,
p86
aVwe 3D-printed this cape and skirt with no seams between the cells,
p87
aVand I'll show more objects like it.
p88
aVThis helmet combines stiff and soft materials
p89
aVin 20-micron resolution.
p90
aVThis is the resolution of a human hair.
p91
aVIt's also the resolution of a CT scanner.
p92
aVThat designers have access
p93
aVto such high-resolution analytic and synthetic tools,
p94
aVenables to design products that fit not only the shape of our bodies,
p95
aVbut also the physiological makeup of our tissues.
p96
aVNext, we designed an acoustic chair,
p97
aVa chair that would be at once structural, comfortable
p98
aVand would also absorb sound.
p99
aVProfessor Carter, my collaborator, and I turned to nature for inspiration,
p100
aVand by designing this irregular surface pattern,
p101
aVit becomes sound-absorbent.
p102
aVWe printed its surface out of 44 different properties,
p103
aVvarying in rigidity, opacity and color,
p104
aVcorresponding to pressure points on the human body.
p105
aVIts surface, as in nature, varies its functionality
p106
aVnot by adding another material or another assembly,
p107
aVbut by continuously and delicately varying material property.
p108
aa(lp109
VBut is nature ideal?
p110
aVAre there no parts in nature?
p111
aVI wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home,
p112
aVbut when I was young,
p113
aVmy grandmother used to tell me stories from the Hebrew Bible,
p114
aVand one of them stuck with me and came to define much of what I care about.
p115
aVAs she recounts:
p116
aV"On the third day of Creation, God commands the Earth
p117
aVto grow a fruit-bearing fruit tree."
p118
aVFor this first fruit tree, there was to be no differentiation
p119
aVbetween trunk, branches, leaves and fruit.
p120
aVThe whole tree was a fruit.
p121
aVInstead, the land grew trees that have bark and stems and flowers.
p122
aVThe land created a world made of parts.
p123
aVI often ask myself,
p124
aV"What would design be like if objects were made of a single part?
p125
aVWould we return to a better state of creation?"
p126
aa(lp127
VSo we looked for that biblical material,
p128
aVthat fruit-bearing fruit tree kind of material, and we found it.
p129
aVThe second-most abundant biopolymer on the planet is called chitin,
p130
aVand some 100 million tons of it are produced every year
p131
aVby organisms such as shrimps, crabs, scorpions and butterflies.
p132
aVWe thought if we could tune its properties,
p133
aVwe could generate structures that are multifunctional
p134
aVout of a single part.
p135
aVSo that's what we did.
p136
aVWe called Legal Seafood \u2014
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
Vwe ordered a bunch of shrimp shells,
p141
aVwe grinded them and we produced chitosan paste.
p142
aVBy varying chemical concentrations,
p143
aVwe were able to achieve a wide array of properties \u2014
p144
aVfrom dark, stiff and opaque,
p145
aVto light, soft and transparent.
p146
aVIn order to print the structures in large scale,
p147
aVwe built a robotically controlled extrusion system with multiple nozzles.
p148
aVThe robot would vary material properties on the fly
p149
aVand create these 12-foot-long structures made of a single material,
p150
aV100 percent recyclable.
p151
aVWhen the parts are ready, they're left to dry
p152
aVand find a form naturally upon contact with air.
p153
aVSo why are we still designing with plastics?
p154
aVThe air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process
p155
aVwere used to contain photosynthetic microorganisms
p156
aVthat first appeared on our planet 3.5 billion year ago,
p157
aVas we learned yesterday.
p158
aVTogether with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT,
p159
aVwe embedded bacteria that were genetically engineered
p160
aVto rapidly capture carbon from the atmosphere
p161
aVand convert it into sugar.
p162
aVFor the first time,
p163
aVwe were able to generate structures that would seamlessly transition
p164
aVfrom beam to mesh,
p165
aVand if scaled even larger, to windows.
p166
aVA fruit-bearing fruit tree.
p167
aVWorking with an ancient material,
p168
aVone of the first lifeforms on the planet,
p169
aVplenty of water and a little bit of synthetic biology,
p170
aVwe were able to transform a structure made of shrimp shells
p171
aVinto an architecture that behaves like a tree.
p172
aVAnd here's the best part:
p173
aVfor objects designed to biodegrade,
p174
aVput them in the sea, and they will nourish marine life;
p175
aVplace them in soil, and they will help grow a tree.
p176
aa(lp177
VThe setting for our next exploration using the same design principles
p178
aVwas the solar system.
p179
aVWe looked for the possibility of creating life-sustaining clothing
p180
aVfor interplanetary voyages.
p181
aVTo do that, we needed to contain bacteria and be able to control their flow.
p182
aVSo like the periodic table, we came up with our own table of the elements:
p183
aVnew lifeforms that were computationally grown,
p184
aVadditively manufactured
p185
aVand biologically augmented.
p186
aVI like to think of synthetic biology as liquid alchemy,
p187
aVonly instead of transmuting precious metals,
p188
aVyou're synthesizing new biological functionality inside very small channels.
p189
aVIt's called microfluidics.
p190
aVWe 3D-printed our own channels in order to control the flow
p191
aVof these liquid bacterial cultures.
p192
aVIn our first piece of clothing, we combined two microorganisms.
p193
aVThe first is cyanobacteria.
p194
aVIt lives in our oceans and in freshwater ponds.
p195
aVAnd the second, E. coli, the bacterium that inhabits the human gut.
p196
aVOne converts light into sugar, the other consumes that sugar
p197
aVand produces biofuels useful for the built environment.
p198
aVNow, these two microorganisms never interact in nature.
p199
aVIn fact, they never met each other.
p200
aVThey've been here, engineered for the first time,
p201
aVto have a relationship inside a piece of clothing.
p202
aVThink of it as evolution not by natural selection,
p203
aVbut evolution by design.
p204
aVIn order to contain these relationships,
p205
aVwe've created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract,
p206
aVthat will help flow these bacteria and alter their function along the way.
p207
aVWe then started growing these channels on the human body,
p208
aVvarying material properties according to the desired functionality.
p209
aVWhere we wanted more photosynthesis, we would design more transparent channels.
p210
aVThis wearable digestive system, when it's stretched end to end,
p211
aVspans 60 meters.
p212
aVThis is half the length of a football field,
p213
aVand 10 times as long as our small intestines.
p214
aVAnd here it is for the first time unveiled at TED \u2014
p215
aVour first photosynthetic wearable,
p216
aVliquid channels glowing with life inside a wearable clothing.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Applause)
p219
aa(lp220
VThank you.
p221
aa(lp222
VMary Shelley said, "We are unfashioned creatures, but only half made up."
p223
aVWhat if design could provide that other half?
p224
aVWhat if we could create structures that would augment living matter?
p225
aVWhat if we could create personal microbiomes
p226
aVthat would scan our skins, repair damaged tissue
p227
aVand sustain our bodies?
p228
aVThink of this as a form of edited biology.
p229
aVThis entire collection, Wanderers, that was named after planets,
p230
aVwas not to me really about fashion per se,
p231
aVbut it provided an opportunity to speculate about the future
p232
aVof our race on our planet and beyond,
p233
aVto combine scientific insight with lots of mystery
p234
aVand to move away from the age of the machine
p235
aVto a new age of symbiosis between our bodies,
p236
aVthe microorganisms that we inhabit,
p237
aVour products and even our buildings.
p238
aVI call this material ecology.
p239
aa(lp240
VTo do this, we always need to return back to nature.
p241
aVBy now, you know that a 3D printer prints material in layers.
p242
aVYou also know that nature doesn't.
p243
aVIt grows. It adds with sophistication.
p244
aVThis silkworm cocoon, for example,
p245
aVcreates a highly sophisticated architecture,
p246
aVa home inside which to metamorphisize.
p247
aVNo additive manufacturing today gets even close to this level of sophistication.
p248
aVIt does so by combining not two materials,
p249
aVbut two proteins in different concentrations.
p250
aVOne acts as the structure, the other is the glue, or the matrix,
p251
aVholding those fibers together.
p252
aVAnd this happens across scales.
p253
aVThe silkworm first attaches itself to the environment \u2014
p254
aVit creates a tensile structure \u2014
p255
aVand it then starts spinning a compressive cocoon.
p256
aVTension and compression, the two forces of life,
p257
aVmanifested in a single material.
p258
aa(lp259
VIn order to better understand how this complex process works,
p260
aVwe glued a tiny earth magnet
p261
aVto the head of a silkworm, to the spinneret.
p262
aVWe placed it inside a box with magnetic sensors,
p263
aVand that allowed us to create this 3-dimensional point cloud
p264
aVand visualize the complex architecture of the silkworm cocoon.
p265
aVHowever, when we placed the silkworm on a flat patch,
p266
aVnot inside a box,
p267
aVwe realized it would spin a flat cocoon
p268
aVand it would still healthily metamorphisize.
p269
aVSo we started designing different environments, different scaffolds,
p270
aVand we discovered that the shape, the composition,
p271
aVthe structure of the cocoon, was directly informed by the environment.
p272
aa(lp273
VSilkworms are often boiled to death inside their cocoons,
p274
aVtheir silk unraveled and used in the textile industry.
p275
aVWe realized that designing these templates allowed us to give shape to raw silk
p276
aVwithout boiling a single cocoon.
p277
aa(lp278
V(Applause)
p279
aa(lp280
VThey would healthily metamorphisize,
p281
aVand we would be able to create these things.
p282
aa(lp283
VSo we scaled this process up to architectural scale.
p284
aVWe had a robot spin the template out of silk,
p285
aVand we placed it on our site.
p286
aVWe knew silkworms migrated toward darker and colder areas,
p287
aVso we used a sun path diagram to reveal the distribution
p288
aVof light and heat on our structure.
p289
aVWe then created holes, or apertures,
p290
aVthat would lock in the rays of light and heat,
p291
aVdistributing those silkworms on the structure.
p292
aa(lp293
VWe were ready to receive the caterpillars.
p294
aVWe ordered 6,500 silkworms from an online silk farm.
p295
aVAnd after four weeks of feeding, they were ready to spin with us.
p296
aVWe placed them carefully at the bottom rim of the scaffold,
p297
aVand as they spin they pupate, they mate, they lay eggs,
p298
aVand life begins all over again \u2014 just like us but much, much shorter.
p299
aa(lp300
VBucky Fuller said that tension is the great integrity,
p301
aVand he was right.
p302
aVAs they spin biological silk over robotically spun silk,
p303
aVthey give this entire pavilion its integrity.
p304
aVAnd over two to three weeks,
p305
aV6,500 silkworms spin 6,500 kilometers.
p306
aVIn a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the Silk Road.
p307
aVThe moths, after they hatch, produce 1.5 million eggs.
p308
aVThis could be used for 250 additional pavilions for the future.
p309
aa(lp310
VSo here they are, the two worldviews.
p311
aVOne spins silk out of a robotic arm,
p312
aVthe other fills in the gaps.
p313
aa(lp314
VIf the final frontier of design is to breathe life into the products
p315
aVand the buildings around us,
p316
aVto form a two-material ecology,
p317
aVthen designers must unite these two worldviews.
p318
aVWhich brings us back, of course, to the beginning.
p319
aVHere's to a new age of design, a new age of creation,
p320
aVthat takes us from a nature-inspired design
p321
aVto a design-inspired nature,
p322
aVand that demands of us for the first time
p323
aVthat we mother nature.
p324
aa(lp325
VThank you.
