VIf we look around us,
p4
aVmuch of what surrounds us
p5
aVstarted life as various rocks and sludge
p6
aVburied in the ground in various places in the world.
p7
aVBut, of course, they don't look like rocks and sludge now.
p8
aVThey look like TV cameras, monitors,
p9
aVannoying radio mics.
p10
aVAnd so this magical transformation
p11
aVis what I was trying to get at with my project,
p12
aVwhich became known as the Toaster Project.
p13
aVAnd it was also inspired by this quote
p14
aVfrom Douglas Adams,
p15
aVand the situation is from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."
p16
aVAnd the situation it describes
p17
aVis the hero of the book \u2014 he's a 20th-century man \u2014
p18
aVfinds himself alone on a strange planet
p19
aVpopulated only by a technologically primitive people.
p20
aVAnd he kind of assumes that, yes,
p21
aVhe'll become \u2014 these villagers \u2014
p22
aVhe'll become their emperor
p23
aVand transform their society
p24
aVwith his wonderful command of technology
p25
aVand science and the elements,
p26
aVbut, of course, realizes
p27
aVthat without the rest of human society,
p28
aVhe can barely make a sandwich,
p29
aVlet alone a toaster.
p30
aVBut he didn't have Wikipedia.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo I thought, okay,
p33
aVI'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch.
p34
aVAnd, working on the idea
p35
aVthat the cheapest electric toaster
p36
aVwould also be the simplest to reverse-engineer,
p37
aVI went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find,
p38
aVtook it home
p39
aVand was kind of dismayed to discover
p40
aVthat, inside this object,
p41
aVwhich I'd bought for just 3.49 pounds,
p42
aVthere were 400 different bits
p43
aVmade out of a hundred-plus different materials.
p44
aVI didn't have the rest of my life to do this project.
p45
aVI had maybe nine months.
p46
aVSo I thought, okay, I'll start with five.
p47
aVAnd these were steel, mica,
p48
aVplastic, copper and nickel.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo, starting with steel: how do you make steel?
p51
aVI went and knocked on the door
p52
aVof the Rio Tinto Chair
p53
aVof Advanced Mineral Extraction at the Royal School of Mines
p54
aVand said, "How do you make steel?"
p55
aVAnd Professor Cilliers was very kind
p56
aVand talked me through it.
p57
aVAnd my vague rememberings from GCSE science \u2014
p58
aVwell, steel comes from iron,
p59
aVso I phoned up an iron mine.
p60
aVAnd said, "Hi, I'm trying to make a toaster.
p61
aVCan I come up and get some iron?"
p62
aVUnfortunately, when I got there \u2014 emerges Ray.
p63
aVHe had misheard me
p64
aVand thought I was coming up because I was trying to make a poster,
p65
aVand so wasn't prepared to take me into the mines.
p66
aVBut after some nagging, I got him to do that.
p67
aa(lp68
V(Video) Ray: It was Crease Limestone,
p69
aVand that was produced
p70
aVby sea creatures
p71
aV350 million years ago
p72
aVin a nice, warm,
p73
aVsunny atmosphere.
p74
aVWhen you study geology,
p75
aVyou can see what's happened in the past,
p76
aVand there were terrific changes in the earth.
p77
aa(lp78
VThomas Thwaites: As you can see, they had the Christmas decorations up.
p79
aVAnd of course, it wasn't actually a working mine anymore,
p80
aVbecause, though Ray was a miner there,
p81
aVthe mine had closed
p82
aVand had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction,
p83
aVbecause, of course, it can't compete
p84
aVon the scale of operations which are happening
p85
aVin South America, Australia, wherever.
p86
aVBut anyway, I got my suitcase of iron ore
p87
aVand dragged it back to London on the train,
p88
aVand then was faced with the problem:
p89
aVOkay, how do you make this rock
p90
aVinto components for a toaster?
p91
aa(lp92
VSo I went back to Professor Cilliers,
p93
aVand he said, "Go to the library."
p94
aVSo I did
p95
aVand was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy \u2014
p96
aVcompletely useless for what I was trying to do.
p97
aVBecause, of course, they don't actually tell you how to do it
p98
aVif you want to do it yourself and you don't have a smelting plant.
p99
aVSo I ended up going to the History of Science Library
p100
aVand looking at this book.
p101
aVThis is the first textbook on metallurgy
p102
aVwritten in the West, at least.
p103
aVAnd there you can see that woodcut
p104
aVis basically what I ended up doing.
p105
aVBut instead of a bellows, I had a leaf blower.
p106
aV(Laughter)
p107
aVAnd that was something that reoccurred throughout the project,
p108
aVwas, the smaller the scale you want to work on,
p109
aVthe further back in time you have to go.
p110
aVAnd so this is after
p111
aVa day and about half a night
p112
aVsmelting this iron.
p113
aVI dragged out this stuff,
p114
aVand it wasn't iron.
p115
aVBut luckily,
p116
aVI found a patent online
p117
aVfor industrial furnaces that use microwaves,
p118
aVand at 30 minutes at full power,
p119
aVand I was able to finish off the process.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo, my next \u2014
p122
aV(Applause)
p123
aVThe next thing I was trying to get was copper.
p124
aVAgain, this mine
p125
aVwas once the largest copper mine in the world.
p126
aVIt's not anymore,
p127
aVbut I found a retired geology professor
p128
aVto take me down,
p129
aVand he said, "Okay, I'll let you have some water from the mine."
p130
aVAnd the reason I was interested in getting water
p131
aVis because water which goes through mines
p132
aVbecomes kind of acidic
p133
aVand will start picking up,
p134
aVdissolving the minerals from the mine.
p135
aVAnd a good example of this is the Rio Tinto,
p136
aVwhich is in Portugal.
p137
aVAs you can see, it's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it.
p138
aVSo many such
p139
aVthat it's now just a home for bacteria
p140
aVwho really like acidic, toxic conditions.
p141
aVBut anyway, the water I dragged back
p142
aVfrom the Isle of Anglesey where the mine was \u2014
p143
aVthere was enough copper in it
p144
aVsuch that I could cast the pins
p145
aVof my metal electric plug.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo my next thing: I was off to Scotland
p148
aVto get mica.
p149
aVAnd mica is a mineral
p150
aVwhich is a very good insulator
p151
aVand very good at insulating electricity.
p152
aVThat's me getting mica.
p153
aVAnd the last material I'm going to talk about today is plastic,
p154
aVand, of course,
p155
aVmy toaster had to have a plastic case.
p156
aVPlastic is the defining feature
p157
aVof cheap electrical goods.
p158
aVAnd so plastic comes from oil, so I phoned up BP
p159
aVand spent a good half an hour
p160
aVtrying to convince the PR office at BP
p161
aVthat it would be fantastic for them
p162
aVif they flew me to an oil rig
p163
aVand let me have a jug of oil.
p164
aVBP obviously has a bit more on their mind now.
p165
aVBut even then
p166
aVthey weren't convinced
p167
aVand said, "Okay, we'll phone you back" \u2014 never did.
p168
aVSo I looked at other ways of making plastic.
p169
aVAnd you can actually make plastic
p170
aVfrom obviously oils which come from plants, but also from starches.
p171
aVSo this is attempting to make
p172
aVpotato starch plastic.
p173
aVAnd for a while that was looking really good.
p174
aVI poured it into the mold, which you can see there,
p175
aVwhich I've made from a tree trunk.
p176
aVAnd it was looking good for a while,
p177
aVbut I left it outside, because you had to leave it outside to dry,
p178
aVand unfortunately I came back
p179
aVand there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo kind of out of desperation,
p182
aVI decided that I could think laterally.
p183
aVAnd geologists have actually christened \u2014
p184
aVwell, they're debating whether to christen \u2014
p185
aVthe age that we're living in \u2014
p186
aVthey're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch
p187
aVcalled the Anthropocene, the age of Man.
p188
aVAnd that's because geologists of the future
p189
aVwould kind of see a sharp shift
p190
aVin the strata of rock that is being laid down now.
p191
aVSo suddenly, it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyl
p192
aVand the 2,000 or so nuclear bombs
p193
aVthat have been set off since 1945.
p194
aVAnd there'd also be an extinction event \u2014
p195
aVlike fossils would suddenly disappear.
p196
aVAnd also, I thought
p197
aVthat there would be
p198
aVsynthetic polymers,
p199
aVplastics, embedded in the rock.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo I looked up a plastic \u2014
p202
aVso I decided that I could mine
p203
aVsome of this modern-day rock.
p204
aVAnd I went up to Manchester
p205
aVto visit a place called Axion Recycling.
p206
aVAnd they're at the sharp end of what's called the WEEE,
p207
aVwhich is this European electrical and electronic waste directive.
p208
aVAnd that was brought into force
p209
aVto try and deal with the mountain of stuff
p210
aVthat is just being made
p211
aVand then living for a while in our homes
p212
aVand then going to landfill.
p213
aVBut this is it.
p214
aa(lp215
V(Music)
p216
aa(lp217
V(Laughter)
p218
aa(lp219
VSo there's a picture
p220
aVof my toaster.
p221
aV(Applause)
p222
aVThat's it without the case on.
p223
aVAnd there it is on the shelves.
p224
aVThanks.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Applause)
p227
aa(lp228
VBruno Giussani: I'm told you did plug it in once.
p229
aa(lp230
VTT: Yeah, I did plug it in.
p231
aVI don't know if you could see,
p232
aVbut I was never able to make insulation for the wires.
p233
aVKew Gardens were insistent
p234
aVthat I couldn't come and hack into their rubber tree.
p235
aVSo the wires were uninsulated.
p236
aVSo there was 240 volts
p237
aVgoing through these homemade copper wires,
p238
aVhomemade plug.
p239
aVAnd for about five seconds,
p240
aVthe toaster toasted,
p241
aVbut then, unfortunately,
p242
aVthe element kind of melted itself.
p243
aVBut I considered it a partial success, to be honest.
