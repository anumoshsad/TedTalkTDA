VTechnology can change our understanding of nature.
p4
aa(lp5
VTake for example the case of lions.
p6
aVFor centuries, it's been said that female lions
p7
aVdo all of the hunting out in the open savanna,
p8
aVand male lions do nothing until it's time for dinner.
p9
aVYou've heard this too, I can tell.
p10
aVWell recently, I led an airborne mapping campaign
p11
aVin the Kruger National Park in South Africa.
p12
aVOur colleagues put GPS tracking collars
p13
aVon male and female lions,
p14
aVand we mapped their hunting behavior
p15
aVfrom the air.
p16
aVThe lower left shows a lion sizing up
p17
aVa herd of impala for a kill,
p18
aVand the right shows what I call
p19
aVthe lion viewshed.
p20
aVThat's how far the lion can see in all directions
p21
aVuntil his or her view is obstructed by vegetation.
p22
aVAnd what we found
p23
aVis that male lions are not the lazy hunters
p24
aVwe thought them to be.
p25
aVThey just use a different strategy.
p26
aVWhereas the female lions hunt
p27
aVout in the open savanna
p28
aVover long distances, usually during the day,
p29
aVmale lions use an ambush strategy
p30
aVin dense vegetation, and often at night.
p31
aVThis video shows the actual hunting viewsheds
p32
aVof male lions on the left
p33
aVand females on the right.
p34
aVRed and darker colors show more dense vegetation,
p35
aVand the white are wide open spaces.
p36
aVAnd this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level
p37
aVof hunting male and female lions.
p38
aVAll of a sudden, you get a very clear understanding
p39
aVof the very spooky conditions under which
p40
aVmale lions do their hunting.
p41
aa(lp42
VI bring up this example to begin,
p43
aVbecause it emphasizes how little we know about nature.
p44
aVThere's been a huge amount of work done so far
p45
aVto try to slow down our losses of tropical forests,
p46
aVand we are losing our forests at a rapid rate,
p47
aVas shown in red on the slide.
p48
aVI find it ironic that we're doing so much,
p49
aVyet these areas are fairly unknown to science.
p50
aVSo how can we save what we don't understand?
p51
aa(lp52
VNow I'm a global ecologist and an Earth explorer
p53
aVwith a background in physics and chemistry
p54
aVand biology and a lot of other boring subjects,
p55
aVbut above all, I'm obsessed with what we don't know
p56
aVabout our planet.
p57
aVSo I created this,
p58
aVthe Carnegie Airborne Observatory, or CAO.
p59
aVIt may look like a plane with a fancy paint job,
p60
aVbut I packed it with over 1,000 kilos
p61
aVof high-tech sensors, computers,
p62
aVand a very motivated staff
p63
aVof Earth scientists and pilots.
p64
aVTwo of our instruments are very unique:
p65
aVone is called an imaging spectrometer
p66
aVthat can actually measure the chemical composition
p67
aVof plants as we fly over them.
p68
aVAnother one is a set of lasers,
p69
aVvery high-powered lasers,
p70
aVthat fire out of the bottom of the plane,
p71
aVsweeping across the ecosystem
p72
aVand measuring it at nearly 500,000 times per second
p73
aVin high-resolution 3D.
p74
aVHere's an image of the Golden Gate Bridge
p75
aVin San Francisco, not far from where I live.
p76
aVAlthough we flew straight over this bridge,
p77
aVwe imaged it in 3D, captured its color
p78
aVin just a few seconds.
p79
aVBut the real power of the CAO
p80
aVis its ability to capture the actual building blocks
p81
aVof ecosystems.
p82
aVThis is a small town in the Amazon,
p83
aVimaged with the CAO.
p84
aVWe can slice through our data
p85
aVand see, for example, the 3D structure
p86
aVof the vegetation and the buildings,
p87
aVor we can use the chemical information
p88
aVto actually figure out how fast the plants are growing
p89
aVas we fly over them.
p90
aVThe hottest pinks are the fastest-growing plants.
p91
aVAnd we can see biodiversity in ways
p92
aVthat you never could have imagined.
p93
aVThis is what a rainforest might look like
p94
aVas you fly over it in a hot air balloon.
p95
aVThis is how we see a rainforest,
p96
aVin kaleidoscopic color that tells us
p97
aVthat there are many species living with one another.
p98
aVBut you have to remember that these trees
p99
aVare literally bigger than whales,
p100
aVand what that means is that they're impossible to understand
p101
aVjust by walking on the ground below them.
p102
aVSo our imagery is 3D, it's chemical, it's biological,
p103
aVand this tells us not only the species
p104
aVthat are living in the canopy,
p105
aVbut it tells us a lot of information
p106
aVabout the rest of the species that occupy the rainforest.
p107
aa(lp108
VNow I created the CAO
p109
aVin order to answer questions that have proven
p110
aVextremely challenging to answer from any other vantage point,
p111
aVsuch as from the ground, or from satellite sensors.
p112
aVI want to share three of those questions with you today.
p113
aVThe first questions is,
p114
aVhow do we manage our carbon reserves
p115
aVin tropical forests?
p116
aVTropical forests contain a huge amount of carbon in the trees,
p117
aVand we need to keep that carbon in those forests
p118
aVif we're going to avoid any further global warming.
p119
aVUnfortunately, global carbon emissions
p120
aVfrom deforestation
p121
aVnow equals the global transportation sector.
p122
aVThat's all ships, airplanes, trains  and automobiles combined.
p123
aVSo it's understandable that policy negotiators
p124
aVhave been working hard to reduce deforestation,
p125
aVbut they're doing it on landscapes
p126
aVthat are hardly known to science.
p127
aVIf you don't know where the carbon is exactly,
p128
aVin detail, how can you know what you're losing?
p129
aVBasically, we need a high-tech accounting system.
p130
aVWith our system, we're able to see the carbon stocks
p131
aVof tropical forests in utter detail.
p132
aVThe red shows, obviously, closed-canopy tropical forest,
p133
aVand then you see the cookie cutting,
p134
aVor the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens.
p135
aVIt's like cutting a cake except this cake
p136
aVis about whale deep.
p137
aVAnd yet, we can zoom in and see the forest
p138
aVand the trees at the same time.
p139
aVAnd what's amazing is, even though we flew
p140
aVvery high above this forest,
p141
aVlater on in analysis, we can go in
p142
aVand actually experience the treetrops,
p143
aVleaf by leaf, branch by branch,
p144
aVjust as the other species that live in this forest
p145
aVexperience it along with the trees themselves.
p146
aa(lp147
VWe've been using the technology to explore
p148
aVand to actually put out the first carbon geographies
p149
aVin high resolution
p150
aVin faraway places like the Amazon Basin
p151
aVand not-so-faraway places like the United States
p152
aVand Central America.
p153
aVWhat I'm going to do is I'm going to take you on a high-resolution, first-time tour
p154
aVof the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Panama.
p155
aVThe colors are going to be going from red to blue.
p156
aVRed is extremely high carbon stocks,
p157
aVyour largest cathedral forests you can imagine,
p158
aVand blue are very low carbon stocks.
p159
aVAnd let me tell you, Peru alone is an amazing place,
p160
aVtotally unknown in terms of its carbon geography
p161
aVuntil today.
p162
aVWe can fly to this area in northern Peru
p163
aVand see super high carbon stocks in red,
p164
aVand the Amazon River and floodplain
p165
aVcutting right through it.
p166
aVWe can go to an area of utter devastation
p167
aVcaused by deforestation in blue,
p168
aVand the virus of deforestation spreading out in orange.
p169
aVWe can also fly to the southern Andes
p170
aVto see the tree line and see exactly how
p171
aVthe carbon geography ends
p172
aVas we go up into the mountain system.
p173
aVAnd we can go to the biggest swamp in the western Amazon.
p174
aVIt's a watery dreamworld
p175
aVakin to Jim Cameron's "Avatar."
p176
aVWe can go to one of the smallest tropical countries,
p177
aVPanama, and see also a huge range
p178
aVof carbon variation,
p179
aVfrom high in red to low in blue.
p180
aVUnfortunately, most of the carbon is lost in the lowlands,
p181
aVbut what you see that's left,
p182
aVin terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds,
p183
aVis the stuff that's up in the mountains.
p184
aVOne interesting exception to this
p185
aVis right in the middle of your screen.
p186
aVYou're seeing the buffer zone around the Panama Canal.
p187
aVThat's in the reds and yellows.
p188
aVThe canal authorities are using force
p189
aVto protect their watershed and global commerce.
p190
aVThis kind of carbon mapping
p191
aVhas transformed conservation
p192
aVand resource policy development.
p193
aVIt's really advancing our ability to save forests
p194
aVand to curb climate change.
p195
aa(lp196
VMy second question: How do we prepare for climate change
p197
aVin a place like the Amazon rainforest?
p198
aVLet me tell you, I spend a lot of time
p199
aVin these places, and we're seeing the climate changing already.
p200
aVTemperatures are increasing,
p201
aVand what's really happening is we're getting a lot of droughts,
p202
aVrecurring droughts.
p203
aVThe 2010 mega-drought is shown here
p204
aVwith red showing an area about the size of Western Europe.
p205
aVThe Amazon was so dry in 2010
p206
aVthat even the main stem of the Amazon river itself
p207
aVdried up partially, as you see in the photo
p208
aVin the lower portion of the slide.
p209
aVWhat we found is that in very remote areas,
p210
aVthese droughts are having a big negative impact
p211
aVon tropical forests.
p212
aVFor example, these are all of the dead trees in red
p213
aVthat suffered mortality following the 2010 drought.
p214
aVThis area happens to be on the border
p215
aVof Peru and Brazil,
p216
aVtotally unexplored,
p217
aValmost totally unknown scientifically.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo what we think, as Earth scientists,
p220
aVis species are going to have to migrate
p221
aVwith climate change from the east in Brazil
p222
aVall the way west into the Andes
p223
aVand up into the mountains
p224
aVin order to minimize their exposure to climate change.
p225
aVOne of the problems with this is that humans
p226
aVare taking apart the western Amazon as we speak.
p227
aVLook at this 100-square-kilometer gash
p228
aVin the forest created by gold miners.
p229
aVYou see the forest in green in 3D,
p230
aVand you see the effects of gold mining
p231
aVdown below the soil surface.
p232
aVSpecies have nowhere to migrate in a system like this, obviously.
p233
aa(lp234
VIf you haven't been to the Amazon, you should go.
p235
aVIt's an amazing experience every time,
p236
aVno matter where you go.
p237
aVYou're going to probably see it this way, on a river.
p238
aVBut what happens is a lot of times
p239
aVthe rivers hide what's really going on
p240
aVback in the forest itself.
p241
aVWe flew over this same river,
p242
aVimaged the system in 3D.
p243
aVThe forest is on the left.
p244
aVAnd then we can digitally remove the forest
p245
aVand see what's going on below the canopy.
p246
aVAnd in this case, we found gold mining activity,
p247
aVall of it illegal,
p248
aVset back away from the river's edge,
p249
aVas you'll see in those strange pockmarks
p250
aVcoming up on your screen on the right.
p251
aVDon't worry, we're working with the authorities
p252
aVto deal with this and many, many other problems
p253
aVin the region.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo in order to put together a conservation plan
p256
aVfor these unique, important corridors
p257
aVlike the western Amazon and the Andes Amazon corridor,
p258
aVwe have to start making
p259
aVgeographically explicit plans now.
p260
aVHow do we do that if we don't know the geography of biodiversity in the region,
p261
aVif it's so unknown to science?
p262
aVSo what we've been doing is using
p263
aVthe laser-guided spectroscopy from the CAO
p264
aVto map for the first time the biodiversity
p265
aVof the Amazon rainforest.
p266
aVHere you see actual data showing different species in different colors.
p267
aVReds are one type of species, blues are another,
p268
aVand greens are yet another.
p269
aVAnd when we take this together and scale up
p270
aVto the regional level,
p271
aVwe get a completely new geography
p272
aVof biodiversity unknown prior to this work.
p273
aVThis tells us where the big biodiversity changes
p274
aVoccur from habitat to habitat,
p275
aVand that's really important because it tells us
p276
aVa lot about where species may migrate to
p277
aVand migrate from as the climate shifts.
p278
aVAnd this is the pivotal information that's needed
p279
aVby decision makers to develop protected areas
p280
aVin the context of their regional development plans.
p281
aa(lp282
VAnd third and final question is,
p283
aVhow do we manage biodiversity on a planet
p284
aVof protected ecosystems?
p285
aVThe example I started out with about lions hunting,
p286
aVthat was a study we did
p287
aVbehind the fence line of a protected area
p288
aVin South Africa.
p289
aVAnd the truth is, much of Africa's nature
p290
aVis going to persist into the future
p291
aVin protected areas like I show in blue on the screen.
p292
aVThis puts incredible pressure and responsibility
p293
aVon park management.
p294
aVThey need to do and make decisions
p295
aVthat will benefit all of the species that they're protecting.
p296
aVSome of their decisions have really big impacts.
p297
aVFor example, how much and where
p298
aVto use fire as a management tool?
p299
aVOr, how to deal with a large species like elephants,
p300
aVwhich may, if their populations get too large,
p301
aVhave a negative impact on the ecosystem
p302
aVand on other species.
p303
aVAnd let me tell you, these types of dynamics
p304
aVreally play out on the landscape.
p305
aVIn the foreground is an area with lots of fire
p306
aVand lots of elephants:
p307
aVwide open savanna in blue, and just a few trees.
p308
aVAs we cross this fence line, now we're getting
p309
aVinto an area that has had protection from fire
p310
aVand zero elephants:
p311
aVdense vegetation, a radically different ecosystem.
p312
aVAnd in a place like Kruger,
p313
aVthe soaring elephant densities
p314
aVare a real problem.
p315
aVI know it's a sensitive issue for many of you,
p316
aVand there are no easy answers with this.
p317
aVBut what's good is that the technology we've developed
p318
aVand we're working with in South Africa, for example,
p319
aVis allowing us to map every single tree in the savanna,
p320
aVand then through repeat flights
p321
aVwe're able to see which trees
p322
aVare being pushed over by elephants,
p323
aVin the red as you see on the screen, and how much that's happening
p324
aVin different types of landscapes in the savanna.
p325
aVThat's giving park managers
p326
aVa very first opportunity to use
p327
aVtactical management strategies that are more nuanced
p328
aVand don't lead to those extremes that I just showed you.
p329
aVSo really, the way we're looking
p330
aVat protected areas nowadays
p331
aVis to think of it as tending to a circle of life,
p332
aVwhere we have fire management,
p333
aVelephant management, those impacts on the structure of the ecosystem,
p334
aVand then those impacts
p335
aVaffecting everything from insects
p336
aVup to apex predators like lions.
p337
aa(lp338
VGoing forward, I plan to greatly expand
p339
aVthe airborne observatory.
p340
aVI'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit
p341
aVso we can manage the entire planet
p342
aVwith technologies like this.
p343
aVUntil then, you're going to find me flying
p344
aVin some remote place that you've never heard of.
p345
aVI just want to end by saying that technology is
p346
aVabsolutely critical to managing our planet,
p347
aVbut even more important is the understanding
p348
aVand wisdom to apply it.
p349
