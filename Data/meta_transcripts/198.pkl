VI want to start my story in Germany, in 1877,
p4
aVwith a mathematician named Georg Cantor.
p5
aVAnd Cantor decided he was going to take a line and erase the middle third of the line,
p6
aVand then take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process, a recursive process.
p7
aVSo he starts out with one line, and then two,
p8
aVand then four, and then 16, and so on.
p9
aVAnd if he does this an infinite number of times, which you can do in mathematics,
p10
aVhe ends up with an infinite number of lines,
p11
aVeach of which has an infinite number of points in it.
p12
aVSo he realized he had a set whose number of elements was larger than infinity.
p13
aVAnd this blew his mind. Literally. He checked into a sanitarium. (Laughter)
p14
aVAnd when he came out of the sanitarium,
p15
aVhe was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory
p16
aVbecause the largest set of infinity would be God Himself.
p17
aVHe was a very religious man.
p18
aVHe was a mathematician on a mission.
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd other mathematicians did the same sort of thing.
p21
aVA Swedish mathematician, von Koch,
p22
aVdecided that instead of subtracting lines, he would add them.
p23
aVAnd so he came up with this beautiful curve.
p24
aVAnd there's no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape;
p25
aVwe can use any seed shape we like.
p26
aVAnd I'll rearrange this and I'll stick this somewhere \u2014 down there, OK \u2014
p27
aVand now upon iteration, that seed shape sort of unfolds into a very different looking structure.
p28
aVSo these all have the property of self-similarity:
p29
aVthe part looks like the whole.
p30
aVIt's the same pattern at many different scales.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow, mathematicians thought this was very strange
p33
aVbecause as you shrink a ruler down, you measure a longer and longer length.
p34
aVAnd since they went through the iterations an infinite number of times,
p35
aVas the ruler shrinks down to infinity, the length goes to infinity.
p36
aVThis made no sense at all,
p37
aVso they consigned these curves to the back of the math books.
p38
aVThey said these are pathological curves, and we don't have to discuss them.
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVAnd that worked for a hundred years.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd then in 1977, Benoit Mandelbrot, a French mathematician,
p43
aVrealized that if you do computer graphics and used these shapes he called fractals,
p44
aVyou get the shapes of nature.
p45
aVYou get the human lungs, you get acacia trees, you get ferns,
p46
aVyou get these beautiful natural forms.
p47
aVIf you take your thumb and your index finger and look right where they meet \u2014
p48
aVgo ahead and do that now \u2014
p49
aV\u2014 and relax your hand, you'll see a crinkle,
p50
aVand then a wrinkle within the crinkle, and a crinkle within the wrinkle. Right?
p51
aVYour body is covered with fractals.
p52
aVThe mathematicians who were saying these were pathologically useless shapes?
p53
aVThey were breathing those words with fractal lungs.
p54
aVIt's very ironic. And I'll show you a little natural recursion here.
p55
aVAgain, we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape.
p56
aVSo here's the second iteration, and the third, fourth and so on.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo nature has this self-similar structure.
p59
aVNature uses self-organizing systems.
p60
aVNow in the 1980s, I happened to notice
p61
aVthat if you look at an aerial photograph of an African village, you see fractals.
p62
aVAnd I thought, "This is fabulous! I wonder why?"
p63
aVAnd of course I had to go to Africa and ask folks why.
p64
aVSo I got a Fulbright scholarship to just travel around Africa for a year
p65
aVasking people why they were building fractals,
p66
aVwhich is a great job if you can get it.
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd so I finally got to this city, and I'd done a little fractal model for the city
p70
aVjust to see how it would sort of unfold \u2014
p71
aVbut when I got there, I got to the palace of the chief,
p72
aVand my French is not very good; I said something like,
p73
aV"I am a mathematician and I would like to stand on your roof."
p74
aVBut he was really cool about it, and he took me up there,
p75
aVand we talked about fractals.
p76
aVAnd he said, "Oh yeah, yeah! We knew about a rectangle within a rectangle,
p77
aVwe know all about that."
p78
aVAnd it turns out the royal insignia has a rectangle within a rectangle within a rectangle,
p79
aVand the path through that palace is actually this spiral here.
p80
aVAnd as you go through the path, you have to get more and more polite.
p81
aVSo they're mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling;
p82
aVit's a conscious pattern. It is not unconscious like a termite mound fractal.
p83
aa(lp84
VThis is a village in southern Zambia.
p85
aVThe Ba-ila built this village about 400 meters in diameter.
p86
aVYou have a huge ring.
p87
aVThe rings that represent the family enclosures get larger and larger as you go towards the back,
p88
aVand then you have the chief's ring here towards the back
p89
aVand then the chief's immediate family in that ring.
p90
aVSo here's a little fractal model for it.
p91
aVHere's one house with the sacred altar,
p92
aVhere's the house of houses, the family enclosure,
p93
aVwith the humans here where the sacred altar would be,
p94
aVand then here's the village as a whole \u2014
p95
aVa ring of ring of rings with the chief's extended family here, the chief's immediate family here,
p96
aVand here there's a tiny village only this big.
p97
aVNow you might wonder, how can people fit in a tiny village only this big?
p98
aVThat's because they're spirit people. It's the ancestors.
p99
aVAnd of course the spirit people have a little miniature village in their village, right?
p100
aVSo it's just like Georg Cantor said, the recursion continues forever.
p101
aa(lp102
VThis is in the Mandara mountains, near the Nigerian border in Cameroon, Mokoulek.
p103
aVI saw this diagram drawn by a French architect,
p104
aVand I thought, "Wow! What a beautiful fractal!"
p105
aVSo I tried to come up with a seed shape, which, upon iteration, would unfold into this thing.
p106
aVI came up with this structure here.
p107
aVLet's see, first iteration, second, third, fourth.
p108
aVNow, after I did the simulation,
p109
aVI realized the whole village kind of spirals around, just like this,
p110
aVand here's that replicating line \u2014 a self-replicating line that unfolds into the fractal.
p111
aVWell, I noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at.
p112
aVSo, when I got to the village,
p113
aVI said, "Can you take me to the square building?
p114
aVI think something's going on there."
p115
aVAnd they said, "Well, we can take you there, but you can't go inside
p116
aVbecause that's the sacred altar, where we do sacrifices every year
p117
aVto keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields."
p118
aVAnd I started to realize that the cycles of fertility
p119
aVwere just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this.
p120
aVAnd the recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo here's a Nankani village in Mali.
p123
aVAnd you can see, you go inside the family enclosure \u2014
p124
aVyou go inside and here's pots in the fireplace, stacked recursively.
p125
aVHere's calabashes that Issa was just showing us,
p126
aVand they're stacked recursively.
p127
aVNow, the tiniest calabash in here keeps the woman's soul.
p128
aVAnd when she dies, they have a ceremony
p129
aVwhere they break this stack called the zalanga and her soul goes off to eternity.
p130
aVOnce again, infinity is important.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, you might ask yourself three questions at this point.
p133
aVAren't these scaling patterns just universal to all indigenous architecture?
p134
aVAnd that was actually my original hypothesis.
p135
aVWhen I first saw those African fractals,
p136
aVI thought, "Wow, so any indigenous group that doesn't have a state society,
p137
aVthat sort of hierarchy, must have a kind of bottom-up architecture."
p138
aVBut that turns out not to be true.
p139
aa(lp140
VI started collecting aerial photographs of Native American and South Pacific architecture;
p141
aVonly the African ones were fractal.
p142
aVAnd if you think about it, all these different societies have different geometric design themes that they use.
p143
aVSo Native Americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry.
p144
aVYou can see on the pottery and the baskets.
p145
aVHere's an aerial photograph of one of the Anasazi ruins;
p146
aVyou can see it's circular at the largest scale, but it's rectangular at the smaller scale, right?
p147
aVIt is not the same pattern at two different scales.
p148
aa(lp149
VSecond, you might ask,
p150
aV"Well, Dr. Eglash, aren't you ignoring the diversity of African cultures?"
p151
aVAnd three times, the answer is no.
p152
aVFirst of all, I agree with Mudimbe's wonderful book, "The Invention of Africa,"
p153
aVthat Africa is an artificial invention of first colonialism,
p154
aVand then oppositional movements.
p155
aVNo, because a widely shared design practice doesn't necessarily give you a unity of culture \u2014
p156
aVand it definitely is not "in the DNA."
p157
aVAnd finally, the fractals have self-similarity \u2014
p158
aVso they're similar to themselves, but they're not necessarily similar to each other \u2014
p159
aVyou see very different uses for fractals.
p160
aVIt's a shared technology in Africa.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd finally, well, isn't this just intuition?
p163
aVIt's not really mathematical knowledge.
p164
aVAfricans can't possibly really be using fractal geometry, right?
p165
aVIt wasn't invented until the 1970s.
p166
aVWell, it's true that some African fractals are, as far as I'm concerned, just pure intuition.
p167
aVSo some of these things, I'd wander around the streets of Dakar
p168
aVasking people, "What's the algorithm? What's the rule for making this?"
p169
aVand they'd say,
p170
aV"Well, we just make it that way because it looks pretty, stupid." (Laughter)
p171
aVBut sometimes, that's not the case.
p172
aVIn some cases, there would actually be algorithms, and very sophisticated algorithms.
p173
aVSo in Manghetu sculpture, you'd see this recursive geometry.
p174
aVIn Ethiopian crosses, you see this wonderful unfolding of the shape.
p175
aa(lp176
VIn Angola, the Chokwe people draw lines in the sand,
p177
aVand it's what the German mathematician Euler called a graph;
p178
aVwe now call it an Eulerian path \u2014
p179
aVyou can never lift your stylus from the surface
p180
aVand you can never go over the same line twice.
p181
aVBut they do it recursively, and they do it with an age-grade system,
p182
aVso the little kids learn this one, and then the older kids learn this one,
p183
aVthen the next age-grade initiation, you learn this one.
p184
aVAnd with each iteration of that algorithm,
p185
aVyou learn the iterations of the myth.
p186
aVYou learn the next level of knowledge.
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd finally, all over Africa, you see this board game.
p189
aVIt's called Owari in Ghana, where I studied it;
p190
aVit's called Mancala here on the East Coast, Bao in Kenya, Sogo elsewhere.
p191
aVWell, you see self-organizing patterns that spontaneously occur in this board game.
p192
aVAnd the folks in Ghana knew about these self-organizing patterns
p193
aVand would use them strategically.
p194
aVSo this is very conscious knowledge.
p195
aa(lp196
VHere's a wonderful fractal.
p197
aVAnywhere you go in the Sahel, you'll see this windscreen.
p198
aVAnd of course fences around the world are all Cartesian, all strictly linear.
p199
aVBut here in Africa, you've got these nonlinear scaling fences.
p200
aVSo I tracked down one of the folks who makes these things,
p201
aVthis guy in Mali just outside of Bamako, and I asked him,
p202
aV"How come you're making fractal fences? Because nobody else is."
p203
aVAnd his answer was very interesting.
p204
aVHe said, "Well, if I lived in the jungle, I would only use the long rows of straw
p205
aVbecause they're very quick and they're very cheap.
p206
aVIt doesn't take much time, doesn't take much straw."
p207
aVHe said, "but wind and dust goes through pretty easily.
p208
aVNow, the tight rows up at the very top, they really hold out the wind and dust.
p209
aVBut it takes a lot of time, and it takes a lot of straw because they're really tight."
p210
aV"Now," he said, "we know from experience
p211
aVthat the farther up from the ground you go, the stronger the wind blows."
p212
aVRight? It's just like a cost-benefit analysis.
p213
aVAnd I measured out the lengths of straw,
p214
aVput it on a log-log plot, got the scaling exponent,
p215
aVand it almost exactly matches the scaling exponent for the relationship between wind speed and height
p216
aVin the wind engineering handbook.
p217
aVSo these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology.
p218
aa(lp219
VThe most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that I found
p220
aVwas actually not in geometry, it was in a symbolic code,
p221
aVand this was Bamana sand divination.
p222
aVAnd the same divination system is found all over Africa.
p223
aVYou can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast,
p224
aVand often the symbols are very well preserved,
p225
aVso each of these symbols has four bits \u2014 it's a four-bit binary word \u2014
p226
aVyou draw these lines in the sand randomly, and then you count off,
p227
aVand if it's an odd number, you put down one stroke,
p228
aVand if it's an even number, you put down two strokes.
p229
aVAnd they did this very rapidly,
p230
aVand I couldn't understand where they were getting \u2014
p231
aVthey only did the randomness four times \u2014
p232
aVI couldn't understand where they were getting the other 12 symbols.
p233
aVAnd they wouldn't tell me.
p234
aVThey said, "No, no, I can't tell you about this."
p235
aVAnd I said, "Well look, I'll pay you, you can be my teacher,
p236
aVand I'll come each day and pay you."
p237
aVThey said, "It's not a matter of money. This is a religious matter."
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd finally, out of desperation, I said,
p240
aV"Well, let me explain Georg Cantor in 1877."
p241
aVAnd I started explaining why I was there in Africa,
p242
aVand they got very excited when they saw the Cantor set.
p243
aVAnd one of them said, "Come here. I think I can help you out here."
p244
aVAnd so he took me through the initiation ritual for a Bamana priest.
p245
aVAnd of course, I was only interested in the math,
p246
aVso the whole time, he kept shaking his head going,
p247
aV"You know, I didn't learn it this way."
p248
aVBut I had to sleep with a kola nut next to my bed, buried in sand,
p249
aVand give seven coins to seven lepers and so on.
p250
aVAnd finally, he revealed the truth of the matter.
p251
aVAnd it turns out it's a pseudo-random number generator using deterministic chaos.
p252
aVWhen you have a four-bit symbol, you then put it together with another one sideways.
p253
aVSo even plus odd gives you odd.
p254
aVOdd plus even gives you odd.
p255
aVEven plus even gives you even. Odd plus odd gives you even.
p256
aVIt's addition modulo 2, just like in the parity bit check on your computer.
p257
aVAnd then you take this symbol, and you put it back in
p258
aVso it's a self-generating diversity of symbols.
p259
aVThey're truly using a kind of deterministic chaos in doing this.
p260
aVNow, because it's a binary code,
p261
aVyou can actually implement this in hardware \u2014
p262
aVwhat a fantastic teaching tool that should be in African engineering schools.
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd the most interesting thing I found out about it was historical.
p265
aVIn the 12th century, Hugo of Santalla brought it from Islamic mystics into Spain.
p266
aVAnd there it entered into the alchemy community as geomancy:
p267
aVdivination through the earth.
p268
aVThis is a geomantic chart drawn for King Richard II in 1390.
p269
aVLeibniz, the German mathematician,
p270
aVtalked about geomancy in his dissertation called "De Combinatoria."
p271
aVAnd he said, "Well, instead of using one stroke and two strokes,
p272
aVlet's use a one and a zero, and we can count by powers of two."
p273
aVRight? Ones and zeros, the binary code.
p274
aVGeorge Boole took Leibniz's binary code and created Boolean algebra,
p275
aVand John von Neumann took Boolean algebra and created the digital computer.
p276
aVSo all these little PDAs and laptops \u2014
p277
aVevery digital circuit in the world \u2014 started in Africa.
p278
aVAnd I know Brian Eno says there's not enough Africa in computers,
p279
aVbut you know, I don't think there's enough African history in Brian Eno.
p280
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p281
aa(lp282
VSo let me end with just a few words about applications that we've found for this.
p283
aVAnd you can go to our website,
p284
aVthe applets are all free; they just run in the browser.
p285
aVAnybody in the world can use them.
p286
aVThe National Science Foundation's Broadening Participation in Computing program
p287
aVrecently awarded us a grant to make a programmable version of these design tools,
p288
aVso hopefully in three years, anybody'll be able to go on the Web
p289
aVand create their own simulations and their own artifacts.
p290
aVWe've focused in the U.S. on African-American students as well as Native American and Latino.
p291
aVWe've found statistically significant improvement with children using this software in a mathematics class
p292
aVin comparison with a control group that did not have the software.
p293
aVSo it's really very successful teaching children that they have a heritage that's about mathematics,
p294
aVthat it's not just about singing and dancing.
p295
aVWe've started a pilot program in Ghana.
p296
aVWe got a small seed grant, just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this;
p297
aVwe're very excited about the future possibilities for that.
p298
aa(lp299
VWe've also been working in design.
p300
aVI didn't put his name up here \u2014 my colleague, Kerry, in Kenya, has come up with this great idea
p301
aVfor using fractal structure for postal address in villages that have fractal structure,
p302
aVbecause if you try to impose a grid structure postal system on a fractal village,
p303
aVit doesn't quite fit.
p304
aVBernard Tschumi at Columbia University has finished using this in a design for a museum of African art.
p305
aVDavid Hughes at Ohio State University has written a primer on Afrocentric architecture
p306
aVin which he's used some of these fractal structures.
p307
aa(lp308
VAnd finally, I just wanted to point out that this idea of self-organization,
p309
aVas we heard earlier, it's in the brain.
p310
aVIt's in the \u2014 it's in Google's search engine.
p311
aVActually, the reason that Google was such a success
p312
aVis because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web.
p313
aVIt's in ecological sustainability.
p314
aVIt's in the developmental power of entrepreneurship,
p315
aVthe ethical power of democracy.
p316
aVIt's also in some bad things.
p317
aVSelf-organization is why the AIDS virus is spreading so fast.
p318
aVAnd if you don't think that capitalism, which is self-organizing, can have destructive effects,
p319
aVyou haven't opened your eyes enough.
p320
aVSo we need to think about, as was spoken earlier,
p321
aVthe traditional African methods for doing self-organization.
p322
aVThese are robust algorithms.
p323
aVThese are ways of doing self-organization \u2014 of doing entrepreneurship \u2014
p324
aVthat are gentle, that are egalitarian.
p325
aVSo if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work,
p326
aVwe need look only no farther than Africa to find these robust self-organizing algorithms.
p327
aVThank you.
