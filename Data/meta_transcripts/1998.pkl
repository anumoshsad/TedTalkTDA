VThere's a man by the name of Captain
p4
aVWilliam Swenson
p5
aVwho recently was awarded the congressional Medal of Honor
p6
aVfor his actions on September 8, 2009.
p7
aa(lp8
VOn that day, a column of American
p9
aVand Afghan troops
p10
aVwere making their way
p11
aVthrough a part of Afghanistan
p12
aVto help protect
p13
aVa group of government officials,
p14
aVa group of Afghan government officials,
p15
aVwho would be meeting with some local
p16
aVvillage elders.
p17
aVThe column came under ambush,
p18
aVand was surrounded on three sides,
p19
aVand amongst many other things,
p20
aVCaptain Swenson was recognized
p21
aVfor running into live fire
p22
aVto rescue the wounded
p23
aVand pull out the dead.
p24
aVOne of the people he rescued was a sergeant,
p25
aVand he and a comrade were making their way
p26
aVto a medevac helicopter.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd what was remarkable about this day
p29
aVis, by sheer coincidence,
p30
aVone of the medevac medics
p31
aVhappened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet
p32
aVand captured the whole scene on camera.
p33
aVIt shows Captain Swenson and his comrade
p34
aVbringing this wounded soldier
p35
aVwho had received a gunshot to the neck.
p36
aVThey put him in the helicopter,
p37
aVand then you see Captain Swenson bend over
p38
aVand give him a kiss
p39
aVbefore he turns around to rescue more.
p40
aa(lp41
VI saw this, and I thought to myself,
p42
aVwhere do people like that come from?
p43
aVWhat is that? That is some deep, deep emotion,
p44
aVwhen you would want to do that.
p45
aVThere's a love there,
p46
aVand I wanted to know why is it that
p47
aVI don't have people that I work with like that?
p48
aVYou know, in the military, they give medals
p49
aVto people who are willing to sacrifice themselves
p50
aVso that others may gain.
p51
aVIn business, we give bonuses to people
p52
aVwho are willing to sacrifice others
p53
aVso that we may gain.
p54
aVWe have it backwards. Right?
p55
aVSo I asked myself, where do people like this come from?
p56
aVAnd my initial conclusion was that they're just better people.
p57
aVThat's why they're attracted to the military.
p58
aVThese better people are attracted
p59
aVto this concept of service.
p60
aVBut that's completely wrong.
p61
aVWhat I learned was that it's the environment,
p62
aVand if you get the environment right,
p63
aVevery single one of us has the capacity
p64
aVto do these remarkable things,
p65
aVand more importantly, others have that capacity too.
p66
aVI've had the great honor of getting to meet
p67
aVsome of these, who we would call heroes,
p68
aVwho have put themselves and put their lives
p69
aVat risk to save others,
p70
aVand I asked them, "Why would you do it?
p71
aVWhy did you do it?"
p72
aVAnd they all say the same thing:
p73
aV"Because they would have done it for me."
p74
aVIt's this deep sense of trust and cooperation.
p75
aVSo trust and cooperation are really important here.
p76
aVThe problem with concepts of trust and cooperation
p77
aVis that they are feelings, they are not instructions.
p78
aVI can't simply say to you, "Trust me," and you will.
p79
aVI can't simply instruct two people  to cooperate, and they will.
p80
aVIt's not how it works. It's a feeling.
p81
aa(lp82
VSo where does that feeling come from?
p83
aVIf you go back 50,000 years
p84
aVto the Paleolithic era,
p85
aVto the early days of Homo sapiens,
p86
aVwhat we find is that the world
p87
aVwas filled with danger,
p88
aVall of these forces working very, very hard to kill us.
p89
aVNothing personal.
p90
aVWhether it was the weather,
p91
aVlack of resources,
p92
aVmaybe a saber-toothed tiger,
p93
aVall of these things working
p94
aVto reduce our lifespan.
p95
aVAnd so we evolved into social animals,
p96
aVwhere we lived together and worked together
p97
aVin what I call a circle of safety, inside the tribe,
p98
aVwhere we felt like we belonged.
p99
aVAnd when we felt safe amongst our own,
p100
aVthe natural reaction was trust and cooperation.
p101
aVThere are inherent benefits to this.
p102
aVIt means I can fall asleep at night
p103
aVand trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger.
p104
aVIf we don't trust each other, if I don't trust you,
p105
aVthat means you won't watch for danger.
p106
aVBad system of survival.
p107
aa(lp108
VThe modern day is exactly the same thing.
p109
aVThe world is filled with danger,
p110
aVthings that are trying to frustrate our lives
p111
aVor reduce our success,
p112
aVreduce our opportunity for success.
p113
aVIt could be the ups and downs in the economy,
p114
aVthe uncertainty of the stock market.
p115
aVIt could be a new technology that renders
p116
aVyour business model obsolete overnight.
p117
aVOr it could be your competition
p118
aVthat is sometimes trying to kill you.
p119
aVIt's sometimes trying to put you out of business,
p120
aVbut at the very minimum
p121
aVis working hard to frustrate your growth
p122
aVand steal your business from you.
p123
aVWe have no control over these forces.
p124
aVThese are a constant,
p125
aVand they're not going away.
p126
aa(lp127
VThe only variable are the conditions
p128
aVinside the organization,
p129
aVand that's where leadership matters,
p130
aVbecause it's the leader that sets the tone.
p131
aVWhen a leader makes the choice
p132
aVto put the safety and lives
p133
aVof the people inside the organization first,
p134
aVto sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice
p135
aVthe tangible results, so that the people remain
p136
aVand feel safe and feel like they belong,
p137
aVremarkable things happen.
p138
aa(lp139
VI was flying on a trip,
p140
aVand I was witness to an incident
p141
aVwhere a passenger attempted to board
p142
aVbefore their number was called,
p143
aVand I watched the gate agent
p144
aVtreat this man like he had broken the law,
p145
aVlike a criminal.
p146
aVHe was yelled at for attempting to board
p147
aVone group too soon.
p148
aVSo I said something.
p149
aVI said, "Why do you have treat us like cattle?
p150
aVWhy can't you treat us like human beings?"
p151
aVAnd this is exactly what she said to me.
p152
aVShe said, "Sir, if I don't follow the rules,
p153
aVI could get in trouble or lose my job."
p154
aVAll she was telling me
p155
aVis that she doesn't feel safe.
p156
aVAll she was telling me is that
p157
aVshe doesn't trust her leaders.
p158
aVThe reason we like flying Southwest Airlines
p159
aVis not because they necessarily hire better people.
p160
aVIt's because they don't fear their leaders.
p161
aa(lp162
VYou see, if the conditions are wrong,
p163
aVwe are forced to expend our own time and energy
p164
aVto protect ourselves from each other,
p165
aVand that inherently weakens the organization.
p166
aVWhen we feel safe inside the organization,
p167
aVwe will naturally combine our talents
p168
aVand our strengths and work tirelessly
p169
aVto face the dangers outside
p170
aVand seize the opportunities.
p171
aa(lp172
VThe closest analogy I can give
p173
aVto what a great leader is, is like being a parent.
p174
aVIf you think about what being a great parent is,
p175
aVwhat do you want? What makes a great parent?
p176
aVWe want to give our child opportunities,
p177
aVeducation, discipline them when necessary,
p178
aVall so that they can grow up and achieve more
p179
aVthan we could for ourselves.
p180
aVGreat leaders want exactly the same thing.
p181
aVThey want to provide their people opportunity,
p182
aVeducation, discipline when necessary,
p183
aVbuild their self-confidence, give them the opportunity to try and fail,
p184
aVall so that they could achieve more
p185
aVthan we could ever imagine for ourselves.
p186
aa(lp187
VCharlie Kim, who's the CEO of a company called Next Jump
p188
aVin New York City, a tech company,
p189
aVhe makes the point that
p190
aVif you had hard times in your family,
p191
aVwould you ever consider laying off one of your children?
p192
aVWe would never do it.
p193
aVThen why do we consider laying off people
p194
aVinside our organization?
p195
aVCharlie implemented a policy
p196
aVof lifetime employment.
p197
aVIf you get a job at Next Jump,
p198
aVyou cannot get fired for performance issues.
p199
aVIn fact, if you have issues,
p200
aVthey will coach you and they will give you support,
p201
aVjust like we would with one of our children
p202
aVwho happens to come home with a C from school.
p203
aVIt's the complete opposite.
p204
aa(lp205
VThis is the reason so many people
p206
aVhave such a visceral hatred, anger,
p207
aVat some of these banking CEOs
p208
aVwith their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures.
p209
aVIt's not the numbers.
p210
aVIt's that they have violated the very definition of leadership.
p211
aVThey have violated this deep-seated social contract.
p212
aVWe know that they allowed their people
p213
aVto be sacrificed so they could protect their own interests,
p214
aVor worse, they sacrificed their people
p215
aVto protect their own interests.
p216
aVThis is what so offends us, not the numbers.
p217
aVWould anybody be offended if we gave
p218
aVa $150 million bonus to Gandhi?
p219
aVHow about a $250 million bonus to Mother Teresa?
p220
aVDo we have an issue with that? None at all.
p221
aVNone at all.
p222
aVGreat leaders would never sacrifice
p223
aVthe people to save the numbers.
p224
aVThey would sooner sacrifice the numbers
p225
aVto save the people.
p226
aa(lp227
VBob Chapman, who runs
p228
aVa large manufacturing company in the Midwest
p229
aVcalled Barry-Wehmiller,
p230
aVin 2008 was hit very hard by the recession,
p231
aVand they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight.
p232
aVNow in a large manufacturing company,
p233
aVthis is a big deal,
p234
aVand they could no longer afford their labor pool.
p235
aVThey needed to save 10 million dollars,
p236
aVso, like so many companies today,
p237
aVthe board got together and discussed layoffs.
p238
aVAnd Bob refused.
p239
aVYou see, Bob doesn't believe in head counts.
p240
aVBob believes in heart counts,
p241
aVand it's much more difficult to simply reduce
p242
aVthe heart count.
p243
aVAnd so they came up with a furlough program.
p244
aVEvery employee, from secretary to CEO,
p245
aVwas required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation.
p246
aVThey could take it any time they wanted,
p247
aVand they did not have to take it consecutively.
p248
aVBut it was how Bob announced the program
p249
aVthat mattered so much.
p250
aVHe said, it's better that we should all suffer a little
p251
aVthan any of us should have to suffer a lot,
p252
aVand morale went up.
p253
aVThey saved 20 million dollars,
p254
aVand most importantly, as would be expected,
p255
aVwhen the people feel safe and protected by the leadership in the organization,
p256
aVthe natural reaction is to trust and cooperate.
p257
aVAnd quite spontaneously, nobody expected,
p258
aVpeople started trading with each other.
p259
aVThose who could afford it more
p260
aVwould trade with those who could afford it less.
p261
aVPeople would take five weeks
p262
aVso that somebody else only had to take three.
p263
aa(lp264
VLeadership is a choice. It is not a rank.
p265
aVI know many people at the seniormost
p266
aVlevels of organizations
p267
aVwho are absolutely not leaders.
p268
aVThey are authorities, and we do what they say
p269
aVbecause they have authority over us,
p270
aVbut we would not follow them.
p271
aVAnd I know many people
p272
aVwho are at the bottoms of organizations
p273
aVwho have no authority
p274
aVand they are absolutely leaders,
p275
aVand this is because they have chosen to look after
p276
aVthe person to the left of them,
p277
aVand they have chosen to look after
p278
aVthe person to the right of them.
p279
aVThis is what a leader is.
p280
aa(lp281
VI heard a story
p282
aVof some Marines
p283
aVwho were out in theater,
p284
aVand as is the Marine custom,
p285
aVthe officer ate last,
p286
aVand he let his men eat first,
p287
aVand when they were done,
p288
aVthere was no food left for him.
p289
aVAnd when they went back out in the field,
p290
aVhis men brought him some of their food
p291
aVso that he may eat,
p292
aVbecause that's what happens.
p293
aVWe call them leaders because they go first.
p294
aVWe call them leaders because they take the risk
p295
aVbefore anybody else does.
p296
aVWe call them leaders because they will choose
p297
aVto sacrifice so that their people
p298
aVmay be safe and protected
p299
aVand so their people may gain,
p300
aVand when we do, the natural response
p301
aVis that our people will sacrifice for us.
p302
aVThey will give us their blood and sweat and tears
p303
aVto see that their leader's vision comes to life,
p304
aVand when we ask them, "Why would you do that?
p305
aVWhy would you give your blood and sweat and tears
p306
aVfor that person?" they all say the same thing:
p307
aV"Because they would have done it for me."
p308
aVAnd isn't that the organization
p309
aVwe would all like to work in?
p310
aa(lp311
VThank you very much.
p312
aa(lp313
