VWhen I was 10 years old,
p4
aVa cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school.
p5
aVAnd as a special treat,
p6
aVhe took me to the pathology lab
p7
aVand took a real human brain
p8
aVout of the jar
p9
aVand placed it in my hands.
p10
aVAnd there it was,
p11
aVthe seat of human consciousness,
p12
aVthe powerhouse of the human body,
p13
aVsitting in my hands.
p14
aVAnd that day I knew that when I grew up,
p15
aVI was going to become a brain doctor,
p16
aVscientist, something or the other.
p17
aa(lp18
VYears later, when I finally grew up,
p19
aVmy dream came true.
p20
aVAnd it was while I was doing my Ph.D.
p21
aVon the neurological causes
p22
aVof dyslexia in children
p23
aVthat I encountered a startling fact
p24
aVthat I'd like to share with you all today.
p25
aVIt is estimated that one in six children,
p26
aVthat's one in six children,
p27
aVsuffer from some developmental disorder.
p28
aVThis is a disorder that
p29
aVretards mental development in the child
p30
aVand causes permanent mental impairments.
p31
aVWhich means that each and every one of you here today
p32
aVknows at least one child that is suffering
p33
aVfrom a developmental disorder.
p34
aa(lp35
VBut here's what really perplexed me.
p36
aVDespite the fact that each
p37
aVand every one of these disorders
p38
aVoriginates in the brain,
p39
aVmost of these disorders
p40
aVare diagnosed solely on the basis
p41
aVof observable behavior.
p42
aVBut diagnosing a brain disorder
p43
aVwithout actually looking at the brain
p44
aVis analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem
p45
aVbased on their physical symptoms,
p46
aVwithout even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray
p47
aVto look at the heart.
p48
aVIt seemed so intuitive to me.
p49
aVTo diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately,
p50
aVit would be necessary to look at the brain directly.
p51
aVLooking at behavior alone
p52
aVcan miss a vital piece of the puzzle
p53
aVand provide an incomplete, or even a misleading,
p54
aVpicture of the child's problems.
p55
aVYet, despite all the advances in medical technology,
p56
aVthe diagnosis of brain disorders
p57
aVin one in six children
p58
aVstill remained so limited.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd then I came across a team at Harvard University
p61
aVthat had taken one such advanced medical technology
p62
aVand finally applied it,
p63
aVinstead of in brain research,
p64
aVtowards diagnosing brain disorders in children.
p65
aVTheir groundbreaking technology
p66
aVrecords the EEG, or the electrical activity
p67
aVof the brain, in real time,
p68
aVallowing us to watch the brain
p69
aVas it performs various functions
p70
aVand then detect even the slightest abnormality
p71
aVin any of these functions:
p72
aVvision, attention, language, audition.
p73
aVA program called Brain Electrical
p74
aVActivity Mapping
p75
aVthen triangulates the source
p76
aVof that abnormality in the brain.
p77
aVAnd another program called
p78
aVStatistical Probability Mapping
p79
aVthen performs mathematical calculations
p80
aVto determine whether any of these abnormalities
p81
aVare clinically significant,
p82
aVallowing us to provide a much more accurate
p83
aVneurological diagnosis
p84
aVof the child's symptoms.
p85
aVAnd so I became the head of neurophysiology
p86
aVfor the clinical arm of this team,
p87
aVand we're finally able to use this technology
p88
aVtowards actually helping
p89
aVchildren with brain disorders.
p90
aVAnd I'm happy to say that I'm now in the process
p91
aVof setting up this technology here in India.
p92
aa(lp93
VI'd like to tell you about one such child,
p94
aVwhose story was also covered by ABC News.
p95
aVSeven-year-old Justin Senigar
p96
aVcame to our clinic with this diagnosis
p97
aVof very severe autism.
p98
aVLike many autistic children,
p99
aVhis mind was locked inside his body.
p100
aVThere were moments when he would
p101
aVactually space out for seconds at a time.
p102
aVAnd the doctors told his parents
p103
aVhe was never going to be able
p104
aVto communicate or interact socially,
p105
aVand he would probably never have too much language.
p106
aa(lp107
VWhen we used this groundbreaking EEG technology
p108
aVto actually look at Justin's brain,
p109
aVthe results were startling.
p110
aVIt turned out that Justin was almost
p111
aVcertainly not autistic.
p112
aVHe was suffering from brain seizures
p113
aVthat were impossible to see with the naked eye,
p114
aVbut that were actually causing symptoms
p115
aVthat mimicked those of autism.
p116
aVAfter Justin was given anti-seizure medication,
p117
aVthe change in him was amazing.
p118
aVWithin a period of 60 days,
p119
aVhis vocabulary went from two to three words
p120
aVto 300 words.
p121
aVAnd his communication and social interaction
p122
aVwere improved so dramatically
p123
aVthat he was enrolled into a regular school
p124
aVand even became a karate super champ.
p125
aa(lp126
VResearch shows that 50 percent of children,
p127
aValmost 50 percent of children
p128
aVdiagnosed with autism
p129
aVare actually suffering from hidden brain seizures.
p130
aVThese are the faces of the children
p131
aVthat I have tested
p132
aVwith stories just like Justin.
p133
aVAll these children
p134
aVcame to our clinic with a diagnosis
p135
aVof autism, attention deficit disorder,
p136
aVmental retardation, language problems.
p137
aVInstead, our EEG scans revealed
p138
aVvery specific problems hidden within their brains
p139
aVthat couldn't possibly have been detected
p140
aVby their behavioral assessments.
p141
aVSo these EEG scans
p142
aVenabled us to provide these children
p143
aVwith a much more accurate neurological diagnosis
p144
aVand much more targeted treatment.
p145
aa(lp146
VFor too long now, children with developmental disorders
p147
aVhave suffered from misdiagnosis
p148
aVwhile their real problems have gone undetected
p149
aVand left to worsen.
p150
aVAnd for too long, these children and their parents
p151
aVhave suffered undue frustration and desperation.
p152
aVBut we are now in a new era of neuroscience,
p153
aVone in which we can finally look
p154
aVdirectly at brain function in real time
p155
aVwith no risks and no side effects, non-invasively,
p156
aVand find the true source
p157
aVof so many disabilities in children.
p158
aa(lp159
VSo if I could inspire
p160
aVeven a fraction of you in the audience today
p161
aVto share this pioneering diagnostic approach
p162
aVwith even one parent whose child
p163
aVis suffering from a developmental disorder,
p164
aVthen perhaps one more puzzle
p165
aVin one more brain will be solved.
p166
aVOne more mind will be unlocked.
p167
aVAnd one more child who has been misdiagnosed
p168
aVor even undiagnosed by the system
p169
aVwill finally realize his or her true potential
p170
aVwhile there's still time
p171
aVfor his or her brain to recover.
p172
aVAnd all this by simply watching the child's brainwaves.
p173
aa(lp174
VThank you.
