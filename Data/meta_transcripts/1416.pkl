VHi, my name is Frank,
p4
aVand I collect secrets.
p5
aVIt all started with a crazy idea
p6
aVin November of 2004.
p7
aVI printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards,
p8
aVjust like this.
p9
aVThey were blank on one side,
p10
aVand on the other side
p11
aVI listed some simple instructions.
p12
aVI asked people to anonymously share an artful secret
p13
aVthey'd never told anyone before.
p14
aVAnd I handed out these postcards randomly
p15
aVon the streets of Washington, D.C.,
p16
aVnot knowing what to expect.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut soon the idea began spreading virally.
p19
aVPeople began to buy their own postcards
p20
aVand make their own postcards.
p21
aVI started receiving secrets in my home mailbox,
p22
aVnot just with postmarks from Washington, D.C.,
p23
aVbut from Texas, California,
p24
aVVancouver, New Zealand, Iraq.
p25
aVSoon my crazy idea didn't seem so crazy.
p26
aVPostSecret.com
p27
aVis the most visited advertisement-free blog in the world.
p28
aVAnd this is my postcard collection today.
p29
aVYou can see my wife
p30
aVstruggling to stack a brick of postcards
p31
aVon a pyramid of over a half-million secrets.
p32
aa(lp33
VWhat I'd like to do now
p34
aVis share with you a very special handful of secrets
p35
aVfrom that collection,
p36
aVstarting with this one.
p37
aV"I found these stamps as a child,
p38
aVand I have been waiting all my life
p39
aVto have someone to send them to.
p40
aVI never did have someone."
p41
aVSecrets can take many forms.
p42
aVThey can be shocking
p43
aVor silly or soulful.
p44
aVThey can connect us to our deepest humanity
p45
aVor with people we'll never meet.
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aVMaybe one of you sent this one in.
p48
aVI don't know.
p49
aVThis one does a great job of demonstrating
p50
aVthe creativity that people have
p51
aVwhen they make and mail me a postcard.
p52
aVThis one obviously was made out of half a Starbucks cup
p53
aVwith a stamp and my home address written on the other side.
p54
aa(lp55
V"Dear Birthmother, I have great parents.
p56
aVI've found love. I'm happy."
p57
aVSecrets can remind us of the countless human dramas,
p58
aVof frailty and heroism,
p59
aVplaying out silently
p60
aVin the lives of people all around us
p61
aVeven now.
p62
aV"Everyone who knew me before 9/11
p63
aVbelieves I'm dead."
p64
aV"I used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people,
p65
aVso sometimes I didn't wear panties,
p66
aVand just had a big smile and chuckled to myself."
p67
aa(lp68
V(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VThis next one takes a little explanation before I share it with you.
p71
aVI love to speak on college campuses
p72
aVand share secrets and the stories with students.
p73
aVAnd sometimes afterwards I'll stick around
p74
aVand sign books and take photos with students.
p75
aVAnd this next postcard was made
p76
aVout of one of those photos.
p77
aVAnd I should also mention that, just like today,
p78
aVat that PostSecret event,
p79
aVI was using a wireless microphone.
p80
aV"Your mic wasn't off during sound check.
p81
aVWe all heard you pee."
p82
aV(Laughter)
p83
aVThis was really embarrassing when it happened,
p84
aVuntil I realized it could have been worse.
p85
aVRight. You know what I'm saying.
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
V"Inside this envelope
p90
aVis the ripped up remains
p91
aVof a suicide note I didn't use.
p92
aVI feel like the happiest person on Earth (now.)"
p93
aV"One of these men is the father of my son.
p94
aVHe pays me a lot to keep it a secret."
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
V"That Saturday when you wondered where I was,
p99
aVwell, I was getting your ring.
p100
aVIt's in my pocket right now."
p101
aVI had this postcard posted on the PostSecret blog
p102
aVtwo years ago on Valentine's Day.
p103
aVIt was the very bottom, the last secret in the long column.
p104
aVAnd it hadn't been up for more than a couple hours
p105
aVbefore I received this exuberant email
p106
aVfrom the guy who mailed me this postcard.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd he said, "Frank, I've got to share with you
p109
aVthis story that just played out in my life."
p110
aVHe said, "My knees are still shaking."
p111
aVHe said, "For three years, my girlfriend and I,
p112
aVwe've made it this Sunday morning ritual
p113
aVto visit the PostSecret blog together
p114
aVand read the secrets out loud.
p115
aVI read some to her, she reads some to me."
p116
aVHe says, "It's really brought us closer together
p117
aVthrough the years.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd so when I discovered
p120
aVthat you had posted
p121
aVmy surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom,
p122
aVI was beside myself.
p123
aVAnd I tried to act calm, not to give anything away.
p124
aVAnd just like every Sunday,
p125
aVwe started reading the secrets out loud to each other."
p126
aVHe said, "But this time it seemed like it was taking her forever
p127
aVto get through each one."
p128
aVBut she finally did.
p129
aVShe got to that bottom secret, his proposal to her.
p130
aVAnd he said, "She read it once and then she read it again."
p131
aVAnd she turned to him and said,
p132
aV"Is that our cat?"
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVAnd when she saw him,
p135
aVhe was down on one knee, he had the ring out.
p136
aVHe popped the question, she said yes. It was a very happy ending.
p137
aa(lp138
VSo I emailed him back
p139
aVand I said, "Please share with me an image, something,
p140
aVthat I can share with the whole PostSecret community
p141
aVand let everyone know your fairy tale ending."
p142
aVAnd he emailed me this picture.
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
V"I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer.
p147
aVI finally got the pictures developed
p148
aVand I'd love to give them to you."
p149
aVThis picture never got returned back
p150
aVto the people who lost it,
p151
aVbut this secret has impacted many lives,
p152
aVstarting with a student up in Canada
p153
aVnamed Matty.
p154
aVMatty was inspired by that secret
p155
aVto start his own website,
p156
aVa website called IFoundYourCamera.
p157
aVMatty invites people
p158
aVto mail him digital cameras that they've found,
p159
aVmemory sticks that have been lost
p160
aVwith orphan photos.
p161
aVAnd Matty takes the pictures off these cameras
p162
aVand posts them on his website every week.
p163
aVAnd people come to visit
p164
aVto see if they can identify a picture they've lost
p165
aVor help somebody else get the photos back to them
p166
aVthat they might be desperately searching for.
p167
aVThis one's my favorite.
p168
aa(lp169
V(Laughter)
p170
aa(lp171
VMatty has found this ingenious way
p172
aVto leverage the kindness of strangers.
p173
aVAnd it might seem like a simple idea, and it is,
p174
aVbut the impact it can have on people's lives can be huge.
p175
aVMatty shared with me
p176
aVan emotional email he received
p177
aVfrom the mother in that picture.
p178
aV"That's me, my husband and son.
p179
aVThe other pictures are of my very ill grandmother.
p180
aVThank you for making your site.
p181
aVThese pictures mean more to me than you know.
p182
aVMy son's birth is on this camera.
p183
aVHe turns four tomorrow."
p184
aVEvery picture that you see there
p185
aVand thousands of others
p186
aVhave been returned back to the person who lost it \u2014
p187
aVsometimes crossing oceans,
p188
aVsometimes going through language barriers.
p189
aa(lp190
VThis is the last postcard I have to share with you today.
p191
aV"When people I love
p192
aVleave voicemails on my phone
p193
aVI always save them in case they die tomorrow
p194
aVand I have no other way
p195
aVof hearing their voice ever again."
p196
aVWhen I posted this secret,
p197
aVdozens of people
p198
aVsent voicemail messages from their phones,
p199
aVsometimes ones they'd been keeping for years,
p200
aVmessages from family or friends
p201
aVwho had died.
p202
aVThey said that by preserving those voices
p203
aVand sharing them,
p204
aVit helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive.
p205
aVOne young girl
p206
aVposted the last message
p207
aVshe ever heard from her grandmother.
p208
aa(lp209
VSecrets can take many forms.
p210
aVThey can be shocking or silly
p211
aVor soulful.
p212
aVThey can connect us with our deepest humanity
p213
aVor with people we'll never meet again.
p214
aa(lp215
VVoicemail recording: First saved voice message.
p216
aVGrandma: \u266b It's somebody's birthday today \u266b
p217
aV\u266b Somebody's birthday today \u266b
p218
aV\u266b The candles are lighted \u266b
p219
aV\u266b on somebody's cake \u266b
p220
aV\u266b And we're all invited \u266b
p221
aV\u266b for somebody's sake \u266b
p222
aVYou're 21 years old today.
p223
aVHave a real happy birthday, and I love you.
p224
aVI'll say bye for now.
p225
aa(lp226
VFW: Thank you.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Applause)
p229
aa(lp230
VThank you.

aa(lp232
V(Applause)
p233
aa(lp234
VJune Cohen: Frank, that was beautiful,
p235
aVso touching.
p236
aVHave you ever sent yourself a postcard?
p237
aVHave you ever sent in a secret to PostSecret?
p238
aa(lp239
VFW: I have one of my own secrets in every book.
p240
aVI think in some ways, the reason I started the project,
p241
aVeven though I didn't know it at the time,
p242
aVwas because I was struggling with my own secrets.
p243
aVAnd it was through crowd-sourcing,
p244
aVit was through the kindness that strangers were showing me,
p245
aVthat I could uncover
p246
aVparts of my past that were haunting me.
p247
aa(lp248
VJC: And has anyone ever discovered
p249
aVwhich secret was yours in the book?
p250
aVHas anyone in your life been able to tell?
p251
aa(lp252
VFW: Sometimes I share that information, yeah.
