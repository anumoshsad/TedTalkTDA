VSo, well, I do applied math,
p4
aVand this is a peculiar problem
p5
aVfor anyone who does applied math, is that
p6
aVwe are like management consultants.
p7
aVNo one knows what the hell we do.
p8
aVSo I am going to give you some \u2014 attempt today
p9
aVto try and explain to you what I do.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo, dancing is one of the most human of activities.
p12
aVWe delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers
p13
aVyou will see later on.
p14
aVNow, ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise
p15
aVand a high level of skill,
p16
aVand probably a level of initial suitability
p17
aVthat may well have a genetic component to it.
p18
aVNow, sadly, neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease
p19
aVgradually destroy this extraordinary ability,
p20
aVas it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling, who was
p21
aVa virtuoso ballet dancer in his time.
p22
aVSo great progress and treatment has been made over the years.
p23
aVHowever, there are 6.3 million people worldwide
p24
aVwho have the disease, and they have to live with
p25
aVincurable weakness, tremor, rigidity
p26
aVand the other symptoms that go along with the disease,
p27
aVso what we need are objective tools
p28
aVto detect the disease before it's too late.
p29
aVWe need to be able to measure progression objectively,
p30
aVand ultimately, the only way we're going to know
p31
aVwhen we actually have a cure is when we have
p32
aVan objective measure that can answer that for sure.
p33
aa(lp34
VBut frustratingly, with Parkinson's disease
p35
aVand other movement disorders, there are no biomarkers,
p36
aVso there's no simple blood test that you can do,
p37
aVand the best that we have is like
p38
aVthis 20-minute neurologist test.
p39
aVYou have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very, very costly,
p40
aVand that means that, outside the clinical trials,
p41
aVit's just never done. It's never done.
p42
aa(lp43
VBut what if patients could do this test at home?
p44
aVNow, that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic,
p45
aVand what if patients could do that test themselves, right?
p46
aVNo expensive staff time required.
p47
aVTakes about $300, by the way,
p48
aVin the neurologist's clinic to do it.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way
p51
aVin which we can try to achieve this,
p52
aVbecause, you see, in one sense, at least,
p53
aVwe are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling.
p54
aa(lp55
VSo here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds.
p56
aVNow, this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds,
p57
aVand we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers,
p58
aVbecause we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs
p59
aVwhen we make sounds, and we all actually
p60
aVhave the genes for it. FoxP2, for example.
p61
aVAnd like ballet, it takes an extraordinary level of training.
p62
aVI mean, just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak.
p63
aVFrom the sound, we can actually track
p64
aVthe vocal fold position as it vibrates,
p65
aVand just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson's,
p66
aVso too are the vocal organs.
p67
aVSo on the bottom trace, you can see an example of
p68
aVirregular vocal fold tremor.
p69
aVWe see all the same symptoms.
p70
aVWe see vocal tremor, weakness and rigidity.
p71
aVThe speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy
p72
aVafter a while, and that's one of the example symptoms of it.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle,
p75
aVin some cases, but with any digital microphone,
p76
aVand using precision voice analysis software
p77
aVin combination with the latest in machine learning,
p78
aVwhich is very advanced by now,
p79
aVwe can now quantify exactly where somebody lies
p80
aVon a continuum between health and disease
p81
aVusing voice signals alone.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo these voice-based tests, how do they stack up against
p84
aVexpert clinical tests? We'll, they're both non-invasive.
p85
aVThe neurologist's test is non-invasive. They both use existing infrastructure.
p86
aVYou don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it.
p87
aVAnd they're both accurate. Okay, but in addition,
p88
aVvoice-based tests are non-expert.
p89
aVThat means they can be self-administered.
p90
aVThey're high-speed, take about 30 seconds at most.
p91
aVThey're ultra-low cost, and we all know what happens.
p92
aVWhen something becomes ultra-low cost,
p93
aVit becomes massively scalable.
p94
aVSo here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now.
p95
aVWe can reduce logistical difficulties with patients.
p96
aVNo need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup.
p97
aVWe can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data.
p98
aVWe can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials,
p99
aVand we can make population-scale screening
p100
aVfeasible for the first time.
p101
aVWe have the opportunity to start to search
p102
aVfor the early biomarkers of the disease before it's too late.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo, taking the first steps towards this today,
p105
aVwe're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative.
p106
aVWith Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we're aiming
p107
aVto record a very large number of voices worldwide
p108
aVto collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals.
p109
aVWe have local numbers accessible to three quarters
p110
aVof a billion people on the planet.
p111
aVAnyone healthy or with Parkinson's can call in, cheaply,
p112
aVand leave recordings, a few cents each,
p113
aVand I'm really happy to announce that we've already hit
p114
aVsix percent of our target just in eight hours.
p115
aVThank you. (Applause)
p116
aV(Applause)
p117
aa(lp118
VTom Rielly: So Max, by taking all these samples of,
p119
aa(lp120
Vlet's say, 10,000 people,
p121
aVyou'll be able to tell who's healthy and who's not?
p122
aVWhat are you going to get out of those samples?
p123
aa(lp124
VMax Little: Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that,
p125
aVduring the call you have to indicate whether or not
p126
aVyou have the disease or not, you see. TR: Right.
p127
aVML: You see, some people may not do it. They may not get through it.
p128
aVBut we'll get a very large sample of data that is collected
p129
aVfrom all different circumstances, and it's getting it
p130
aVin different circumstances that matter because then
p131
aVwe are looking at ironing out the confounding factors,
p132
aVand looking for the actual markers of the disease.
p133
aa(lp134
VTR: So you're 86 percent accurate right now?
p135
aa(lp136
VML: It's much better than that.
p137
aVActually, my student Thanasis, I have to plug him,
p138
aVbecause he's done some fantastic work,
p139
aVand now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well,
p140
aVwhich enables this project, and we're getting 99 percent accuracy.
p141
aa(lp142
VTR: Ninety-nine. Well, that's an improvement.
p143
aVSo what that means is that people will be able to \u2014
p144
aVML: (Laughs)
p145
aVTR: People will be able to call in from their mobile phones
p146
aVand do this test, and people with Parkinson's could call in,
p147
aVrecord their voice, and then their doctor can check up
p148
aVon their progress, see where they're doing in this course of the disease.
p149
aa(lp150
VML: Absolutely.
p151
aa(lp152
VTR: Thanks so much. Max Little, everybody.
p153
aa(lp154
VML: Thanks, Tom. (Applause)
