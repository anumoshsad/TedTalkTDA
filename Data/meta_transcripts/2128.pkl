VIf there's any power in design,
p4
aVthat's the power of synthesis.
p5
aVThe more complex the problem,
p6
aVthe more the need for simplicity.
p7
aVSo allow me to share three cases
p8
aVwhere we tried to apply
p9
aVdesign's power of synthesis.
p10
aa(lp11
VLet's start with the global challenge of urbanization.
p12
aVIt's a fact that people are moving towards cities.
p13
aVand even if counterintuitive, it's good news.
p14
aVEvidence shows that people are better off in cities.
p15
aVBut there's a problem that I would call
p16
aVthe "3S" menace:
p17
aVThe scale, speed, and scarcity of means
p18
aVwith which we will have to respond to this phenomenon
p19
aVhas no precedence in history.
p20
aVFor you to have an idea,
p21
aVout of the three billion  people living in cities today,
p22
aVone billion are under the line of poverty.
p23
aVBy 2030, out of the five billion people
p24
aVthat will be living in cities,
p25
aVtwo billion are going to  be under the line of poverty.
p26
aVThat means that we will have to build
p27
aVa one million-person city per week
p28
aVwith 10,000 dollars per family
p29
aVduring the next 15 years.
p30
aVA one million-person city per week
p31
aVwith 10,000 dollars per family.
p32
aVIf we don't solve this equation,
p33
aVit is not that people  will stop coming to cities.
p34
aVThey will come anyhow,
p35
aVbut they will live in slums, favelas
p36
aVand informal settlements.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo what to do? Well, an answer may come
p39
aVfrom favelas and slums themselves.
p40
aVA clue could be in this  question we were asked
p41
aV10 years ago.
p42
aVWe were asked to accommodate 100 families
p43
aVthat had been occupying illegally
p44
aVhalf a hectare in the center
p45
aVof the city of Iquique  in the north of Chile
p46
aVusing a $10,000 subsidy
p47
aVwith which we had to buy the land,
p48
aVprovide the infrastructure,
p49
aVand build the houses that,  in the best of the cases,
p50
aVwould be of around 40 square meters.
p51
aVAnd by the way, they said,
p52
aVthe cost of the land,
p53
aVbecause it's in the center of the city,
p54
aVis three times more
p55
aVthan what social housing can normally afford.
p56
aVDue to the difficulty of the question,
p57
aVwe decided to include the families
p58
aVin the process of understanding the constraints,
p59
aVand we started a participatory design process,
p60
aVand testing what was  available there in the market.
p61
aVDetached houses,
p62
aV30 families could be accommodated.
p63
aVRow houses, 60 families.
p64
aV["100 families"] The only way to accommodate all of them
p65
aVwas by building in height,
p66
aVand they threatened us
p67
aVto go on a hunger strike
p68
aVif we even dared to offer this
p69
aVas a solution,
p70
aVbecause they could not  make the tiny apartments
p71
aVexpand.
p72
aVSo the conclusion with the families \u2014
p73
aVand this is important,  not our conclusion \u2014
p74
aVwith the families, was that we had a problem.
p75
aVWe had to innovate.
p76
aa(lp77
VSo what did we do?
p78
aVWell, a middle-class family
p79
aVlives reasonably well
p80
aVin around 80 square meters,
p81
aVbut when there's no money,
p82
aVwhat the market does
p83
aVis to reduce the size of the house
p84
aVto 40 square meters.
p85
aVWhat we said was,
p86
aVwhat if,
p87
aVinstead of thinking of 40 square meters
p88
aVas a small house,
p89
aVwhy don't we consider it
p90
aVhalf of a good one?
p91
aVWhen you rephrase the problem
p92
aVas half of a good house
p93
aVinstead of a small one,
p94
aVthe key question is, which half do we do?
p95
aVAnd we thought we had  to do with public money
p96
aVthe half that families won't  be able to do individually.
p97
aVWe identified five design conditions
p98
aVthat belonged to the hard half of a house,
p99
aVand we went back to the  families to do two things:
p100
aVjoin forces and split tasks.
p101
aVOur design was something in between
p102
aVa building and a house.
p103
aVAs a building, it could pay
p104
aVfor expensive, well-located land,
p105
aVand as a house, it could expand.
p106
aVIf, in the process of not being expelled
p107
aVto the periphery while getting a house,
p108
aVfamilies kept their  network and their jobs,
p109
aVwe knew that the expansion  would begin right away.
p110
aVSo we went from this initial social housing
p111
aVto a middle-class unit achieved by families themselves
p112
aVwithin a couple of weeks.
p113
aa(lp114
VThis was our first project
p115
aVin Iquique 10 years ago.
p116
aVThis is our last project in Chile.
p117
aVDifferent designs, same principle:
p118
aVYou provide the frame,
p119
aVand from then on, families take over.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo the purpose of design,
p122
aVtrying to understand and  trying to give an answer
p123
aVto the "3S" menace,
p124
aVscale, speed, and scarcity,
p125
aVis to channel people's own building capacity.
p126
aVWe won't solve the one million people per week equation
p127
aVunless we use people's own power for building.
p128
aVSo, with the right design,
p129
aVslums and favelas may not be the problem
p130
aVbut actually the only possible solution.
p131
aVThe second case is how design can contribute
p132
aVto sustainability.
p133
aVIn 2012, we entered the competition
p134
aVfor the Angelini Innovation Center,
p135
aVand the aim was to build
p136
aVthe right environment for knowledge creation.
p137
aVIt is accepted that for such an aim,
p138
aVknowledge creation,
p139
aVinteraction among people,  face-to-face contact,
p140
aVit's important, and we agreed on that.
p141
aVBut for us, the question  of the right environment
p142
aVwas a very literal question.
p143
aVWe wanted to have a working space
p144
aVwith the right light, with the right temperature,
p145
aVwith the right air.
p146
aVSo we asked ourselves:
p147
aVDoes the typical office building
p148
aVhelp us in that sense?
p149
aVWell, how does that  building look, typically?
p150
aVIt's a collection of floors,
p151
aVone on top of each other,
p152
aVwith a core in the center
p153
aVwith elevators, stairs,  pipes, wires, everything,
p154
aVand then a glass skin on the outside
p155
aVthat, due to direct sun radiation,
p156
aVcreates a huge greenhouse effect inside.
p157
aVIn addition to that, let's say a guy
p158
aVworking on the seventh floor
p159
aVgoes every single day  through the third floor,
p160
aVbut has no idea what the guy on that floor
p161
aVis working on.
p162
aVSo we thought, well, maybe  we have to turn this scheme
p163
aVinside out.
p164
aVAnd what we did was,
p165
aVlet's have an open atrium,
p166
aVa hollowed core,
p167
aVthe same collection of floors,
p168
aVbut have the walls and the mass in the perimeter,
p169
aVso that when the sun hits,
p170
aVit's not impacting directly glass, but a wall.
p171
aVWhen you have an open atrium inside,
p172
aVyou are able to see what others are doing
p173
aVfrom within the building, and you have
p174
aVa better way to control light,
p175
aVand when you place the mass and the walls
p176
aVin the perimeter,
p177
aVthen you are preventing direct sun radiation.
p178
aVYou may also open those windows
p179
aVand get cross-ventilation.
p180
aVWe just made those openings
p181
aVof such a scale that they could work
p182
aVas elevated squares,
p183
aVoutdoor spaces throughout
p184
aVthe entire height of the building.
p185
aVNone of this is rocket science.
p186
aVYou don't require sophisticated programming.
p187
aVIt's not about technology.
p188
aVThis is just archaic,  primitive common sense,
p189
aVand by using common sense,
p190
aVwe went from 120 kilowatts
p191
aVper square meter per year,
p192
aVwhich is the typical energy consumption
p193
aVfor cooling a glass tower,
p194
aVto 40 kilowatts per square meter per year.
p195
aVSo with the right design,
p196
aVsustainability is nothing but the rigorous use
p197
aVof common sense.
p198
aVLast case I would like  to share is how design
p199
aVcan provide more comprehensive answers
p200
aVagainst natural disasters.
p201
aVYou may know that Chile, in 2010,
p202
aVwas hit by an 8.8 Richter scale
p203
aVearthquake and tsunami,
p204
aVand we were called to work
p205
aVin the reconstruction of the Constitución,
p206
aVin the southern part of the country.
p207
aVWe were given 100 days, three months,
p208
aVto design almost everything,
p209
aVfrom public buildings to public space,
p210
aVstreet grid, transportation, housing,
p211
aVand mainly how to protect the city
p212
aVagainst future tsunamis.
p213
aVThis was new in Chilean urban design,
p214
aVand there were in the  air a couple of alternatives.
p215
aVFirst one:
p216
aVForbid installation on ground zero.
p217
aVThirty million dollars spent mainly
p218
aVin land expropriation.
p219
aVThis is exactly what's being discussed in Japan nowadays,
p220
aVand if you have a disciplined population
p221
aVlike the Japanese, this may work,
p222
aVbut we know that in Chile,
p223
aVthis land is going to be  occupied illegally anyhow,
p224
aVso this alternative was  unrealistic and undesirable.
p225
aVSecond alternative: build a big wall,
p226
aVheavy infrastructure to resist
p227
aVthe energy of the waves.
p228
aVThis alternative was conveniently lobbied
p229
aVby big building companies,
p230
aVbecause it meant 42 million  dollars in contracts,
p231
aVand was also politically preferred,
p232
aVbecause it required no land expropriation.
p233
aVBut Japan proved that trying to resist
p234
aVthe force of nature is useless.
p235
aVSo this alternative was irresponsible.
p236
aVAs in the housing process,
p237
aVwe had to include the community
p238
aVin the way of finding a solution for this,
p239
aVand we started a participatory design process.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Video) [In Spanish] Loudspeaker: What kind of city do you want?
p242
aVVote for Constitución.
p243
aVGo to the Open House and express your options.
p244
aVParticipate!
p245
aa(lp246
VFisherman: I am a fisherman.
p247
aVTwenty-five fishermen work for me.
p248
aVWhere should I take them? To the forest?
p249
aa(lp250
VMan: So why can't we have a concrete defense?
p251
aVDone well, of course.
p252
aa(lp253
VMan 2: I am the history of Constitución.
p254
aVAnd you come here to tell me that I cannot keep on living here?
p255
aVMy whole family has lived here,
p256
aVI raised my children here,
p257
aVand my children will also  raise their children here.
p258
aVand my grandchildren  and everyone else will.
p259
aVBut why are you imposing this on me?
p260
aVYou! You are imposing this on me!
p261
aVIn danger zone I am not authorized to build.
p262
aVHe himself is saying that.
p263
aa(lp264
VMan 3: No, no, no, Nieves...
p265
aa(lp266
VAlejandro Aravena: I don't know if you were able
p267
aVto read the subtitles, but you can tell
p268
aVfrom the body language
p269
aVthat participatory design
p270
aVis not a hippie, romantic,
p271
aVlet's-all-dream-together-about- the-future-of-the-city
p272
aVkind of thing.
p273
aVIt is actually \u2014 (Applause)
p274
aVIt is actually not even with the families
p275
aVtrying to find the right answer.
p276
aVIt is mainly trying to identify with precision
p277
aVwhat is the right question.
p278
aVThere is nothing worse than answering well
p279
aVthe wrong question.
p280
aa(lp281
VSo it was pretty obvious after this process
p282
aVthat, well, we chicken out here
p283
aVand go away because it's too tense,
p284
aVor we go even further in asking,
p285
aVwhat else is bothering you?
p286
aVWhat other problems do you have
p287
aVand you want us to take  care of now that the city
p288
aVwill have to be rethought from scratch?
p289
aVAnd what they said was,
p290
aVlook, fine to protect the city  against future tsunamis,
p291
aVwe really appreciate, but the next one  is going to come in, what, 20 years?
p292
aVBut every single year, we have problems
p293
aVof flooding due to rain.
p294
aVIn addition, we are in the middle
p295
aVof the forest region of the country,
p296
aVand our public space sucks.
p297
aVIt's poor and it's scarce.
p298
aVAnd the origin of the city, our identity,
p299
aVis not really connected to the buildings that fell,
p300
aVit is connected to the river,
p301
aVbut the river cannot be accessed publicly,
p302
aVbecause its shores are privately owned.
p303
aVSo we thought that we had to produce a third alternative,
p304
aVand our approach was  against geographical threats,
p305
aVhave geographical answers.
p306
aVWhat if, in between the city
p307
aVand the sea
p308
aVwe have a forest,
p309
aVa forest that doesn't try to resist
p310
aVthe energy of nature,
p311
aVbut dissipates it by introducing friction?
p312
aVA forest that may be able to laminate the water
p313
aVand prevent the flooding?
p314
aVThat may pay the historical debt of public space,
p315
aVand that may provide, finally,
p316
aVdemocratic access to the river.
p317
aVSo as a conclusion of the participatory design,
p318
aVthe alternative was validated politically and socially,
p319
aVbut there was still the problem of the cost:
p320
aV48 million dollars.
p321
aVSo what we did was a survey
p322
aVin the public investment system,
p323
aVand found out that there  were three ministries
p324
aVwith three projects in  the exact same place,
p325
aVnot knowing of the existence  of the other projects.
p326
aVThe sum of them: 52 million dollars.
p327
aVSo design's power of synthesis
p328
aVis trying to make a more efficient use
p329
aVof the scarcest resource in cities,
p330
aVwhich is not money but coordination.
p331
aVBy doing so, we were able to save
p332
aVfour million dollars, and  that is why the forest
p333
aVis today under construction.
p334
aV(Applause)
p335
aa(lp336
VSo be it the force of self construction,
p337
aVthe force of common sense,
p338
aVor the force of nature, all these forces
p339
aVneed to be translated into form,
p340
aVand what that form is modeling and shaping
p341
aVis not cement, bricks, or wood.
p342
aVIt is life itself.
p343
aVDesign's power of synthesis
p344
aVis just an attempt to put
p345
aVat the innermost core of architecture
p346
aVthe force of life.
