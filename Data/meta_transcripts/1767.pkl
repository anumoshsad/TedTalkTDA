VAllow me to start this talk with a question to everyone.
p4
aVYou know that all over the world,
p5
aVpeople fight for their freedom,
p6
aVfight for their rights.
p7
aVSome battle oppressive governments.
p8
aVOthers battle oppressive societies.
p9
aVWhich battle do you think is harder?
p10
aVAllow me to try to answer this question
p11
aVin the few coming minutes.
p12
aa(lp13
VLet me take you back two years ago in my life.
p14
aVIt was the bedtime of my son, Aboody.
p15
aVHe was five at the time.
p16
aVAfter finishing his bedtime rituals,
p17
aVhe looked at me and he asked a question:
p18
aV"Mommy, are we bad people?"
p19
aa(lp20
VI was shocked.
p21
aV"Why do you say such things, Aboody?"
p22
aa(lp23
VEarlier that day, I noticed some bruises
p24
aVon his face when he came from school.
p25
aVHe wouldn't tell me what happened.
p26
aV[But now] he was ready to tell.
p27
aa(lp28
V"Two boys hit me today in school.
p29
aVThey told me, 'We saw your mom on Facebook.
p30
aVYou and your mom should be put in jail.'"
p31
aa(lp32
VI've never been afraid to tell Aboody anything.
p33
aVI've been always a proud woman of my achievements.
p34
aVBut those questioning eyes of my son
p35
aVwere my moment of truth,
p36
aVwhen it all came together.
p37
aVYou see, I'm a Saudi woman who had been put in jail
p38
aVfor driving a car in a country
p39
aVwhere women are not supposed to drive cars.
p40
aVJust for giving me his car keys,
p41
aVmy own brother was detained twice,
p42
aVand he was harassed to the point he had
p43
aVto quit his job as a geologist,
p44
aVleave the country with his wife and two-year-old son.
p45
aVMy father had to sit in a Friday sermon
p46
aVlistening to the imam condemning women drivers
p47
aVand calling them prostitutes
p48
aVamongst tons of worshippers,
p49
aVsome of them our friends and family of my own father.
p50
aVI was faced with an organized defamation campaign
p51
aVin the local media combined with false rumors
p52
aVshared in family gatherings, in the streets
p53
aVand in schools.
p54
aVIt all hit me.
p55
aVIt came into focus that those kids
p56
aVdid not mean to be rude to my son.
p57
aVThey were just influenced by the adults around them.
p58
aVAnd it wasn't about me, and it wasn't a punishment
p59
aVfor taking the wheel and driving a few miles.
p60
aVIt was a punishment for daring to challenge
p61
aVthe society's rules.
p62
aa(lp63
VBut my story goes beyond this moment of truth of mine.
p64
aVAllow me to give you a briefing
p65
aVabout my story.
p66
aVIt was May, 2011,
p67
aVand I was complaining to a work colleague
p68
aVabout the harassments I had to face
p69
aVtrying to find a ride back home,
p70
aValthough I have a car and an international driver's license.
p71
aVAs long as I've known, women in Saudi Arabia
p72
aVhave been always complaining about the ban,
p73
aVbut it's been 20 years since anyone
p74
aVtried to do anything about it,
p75
aVa whole generation ago.
p76
aa(lp77
VHe broke the good/bad news in my face.
p78
aV"But there is no law banning you from driving."
p79
aa(lp80
VI looked it up, and he was right.
p81
aVThere wasn't an actual law in Saudi Arabia.
p82
aVIt was just a custom and traditions
p83
aVthat are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas
p84
aVand imposed on women.
p85
aVThat realization ignited the idea of June 17,
p86
aVwhere we encouraged women to take the wheel
p87
aVand go drive.
p88
aVIt was a few weeks later, we started receiving all these
p89
aV"Man wolves will rape you if you go and drive."
p90
aVA courageous woman, her name is Najla Hariri,
p91
aVshe's a Saudi woman in the city of Jeddah,
p92
aVshe drove a car and she announced
p93
aVbut she didn't record a video.
p94
aVWe needed proof.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo I drove. I posted a video on YouTube.
p97
aVAnd to my surprise,
p98
aVit got hundreds of thousands of views the first day.
p99
aVWhat happened next, of course?
p100
aVI started receiving threats
p101
aVto be killed, raped, just to stop this campaign.
p102
aa(lp103
VThe Saudi authorities remained very quiet.
p104
aVThat really creeped us out.
p105
aVI was in the campaign with other Saudi women
p106
aVand even men activists.
p107
aVWe wanted to know how the authorities
p108
aVwould respond on the actual day, June 17,
p109
aVwhen women go out and drive.
p110
aVSo this time I asked my brother
p111
aVto come with me and drive by a police car.
p112
aVIt went fast. We were arrested,
p113
aVsigned a pledge not to drive again, released.
p114
aVArrested again, he was sent to detention for one day,
p115
aVand I was sent to jail.
p116
aVI wasn't sure why I was sent there,
p117
aVbecause I didn't face any charges in the interrogation.
p118
aVBut what I was sure of was my innocence.
p119
aVI didn't break a law, and I kept my abaya
p120
aV\u2014 it's a black cloak we wear in Saudi Arabia before we leave the house \u2014
p121
aVand my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off,
p122
aVbut I was so sure of my innocence, I kept saying,
p123
aV"No, I'm leaving today."
p124
aVOutside the jail, the whole country went into a frenzy,
p125
aVsome attacking me badly,
p126
aVand others supportive and even collecting signatures
p127
aVin a petition to be sent to the king to release me.
p128
aVI was released after nine days.
p129
aa(lp130
VJune 17 comes.
p131
aVThe streets were packed with police cars
p132
aVand religious police cars,
p133
aVbut some hundred brave Saudi women
p134
aVbroke the ban and drove that day.
p135
aVNone were arrested. We broke the taboo.
p136
aa(lp137
V(Applause)
p138
aa(lp139
VSo I think by now, everyone knows that we can't drive,
p140
aVor women are not allowed to drive, in Saudi Arabia,
p141
aVbut maybe few know why.
p142
aVAllow me to help you answer this question.
p143
aa(lp144
VThere was this official study
p145
aVthat was presented to the Shura Council \u2014
p146
aVit's the consultative council appointed
p147
aVby the king in Saudi Arabia \u2014
p148
aVand it was done by a local professor,
p149
aVa university professor.
p150
aVHe claims it's done based on a UNESCO study.
p151
aVAnd the study states,
p152
aVthe percentage of rape, adultery,
p153
aVillegitimate children, even drug abuse,
p154
aVprostitution in countries where women drive
p155
aVis higher than countries where women don't drive.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VI know, I was like this, I was shocked.
p160
aVI was like, "We are the last country in the world
p161
aVwhere women don't drive."
p162
aVSo if you look at the map of the world,
p163
aVthat only leaves two countries:
p164
aVSaudi Arabia, and the other society is the rest of the world.
p165
aa(lp166
VWe started a hashtag on Twitter mocking the study,
p167
aVand it made headlines around the world.
p168
aa(lp169
V[BBC News: 'End of virginity' if women drive, Saudi cleric warns]
p170
aa(lp171
V(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd only then we realized it's so empowering
p174
aVto mock your oppressor.
p175
aVIt strips it away of its strongest weapon: fear.
p176
aa(lp177
VThis system is based on ultra-conservative
p178
aVtraditions and customs
p179
aVthat deal with women as if they are inferior
p180
aVand they need a guardian to protect them,
p181
aVso they need to take permission from this guardian,
p182
aVwhether verbal or written, all their lives.
p183
aVWe are minors until the day we die.
p184
aVAnd it becomes worse when it's enshrined in religious fatwas
p185
aVbased on wrong interpretation of the sharia law,
p186
aVor the religious laws.
p187
aVWhat's worst, when they become codified
p188
aVas laws in the system,
p189
aVand when women themselves believe in their inferiority,
p190
aVand they even fight those who try
p191
aVto question these rules.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo for me, it wasn't only about these attacks I had to face.
p194
aVIt was about living two totally different
p195
aVperceptions of my personality, of my person \u2014
p196
aVthe villain back in my home country,
p197
aVand the hero outside.
p198
aa(lp199
VJust to tell you, two stories happened in the last two years.
p200
aVOne of them is when I was in jail.
p201
aVI'm pretty sure when I was in jail,
p202
aVeveryone saw titles in the international media
p203
aVsomething like this during these nine days I was in jail.
p204
aa(lp205
VBut in my home country, it was a totally different picture.
p206
aVIt was more like this:
p207
aV"Manal al-Sharif faces charges of disturbing public order
p208
aVand inciting women to drive."
p209
aa(lp210
VI know.
p211
aa(lp212
V"Manal al-Sharif withdraws from the campaign."
p213
aa(lp214
VAh, it's okay. This is my favorite.
p215
aa(lp216
V"Manal al-Sharif breaks down and confesses:
p217
aV'Foreign forces incited me.'"
p218
aa(lp219
V(Laughter)
p220
aa(lp221
VAnd it goes on, even trial and flogging me in public.
p222
aVSo it's a totally different picture.
p223
aa(lp224
VI was asked last year to give a speech
p225
aVat the Oslo Freedom Forum.
p226
aVI was surrounded by this love
p227
aVand the support of people around me,
p228
aVand they looked at me as an inspiration.
p229
aVAt the same time, I flew back to my home country,
p230
aVthey hated that speech so much.
p231
aVThe way they called it: a betrayal to the Saudi country
p232
aVand the Saudi people,
p233
aVand they even started a hashtag called #OsloTraitor on Twitter.
p234
aVSome 10,000 tweets were written in that hashtag,
p235
aVwhile the opposite hashtag, #OsloHero,
p236
aVthere was like a handful of tweets written.
p237
aVThey even started a poll.
p238
aVMore than 13,000 voters answered this poll:
p239
aVwhether they considered me a traitor or not after that speech.
p240
aVNinety percent said yes, she's a traitor.
p241
aVSo it's these two totally different perceptions
p242
aVof my personality.
p243
aa(lp244
VFor me, I'm a proud Saudi woman,
p245
aVand I do love my country,
p246
aVand because I love my country, I'm doing this.
p247
aVBecause I believe a society will not be free
p248
aVif the women of that society are not free.
p249
aV(Applause)
p250
aVThank you.
p251
aV(Applause)
p252
aVThank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
p253
aV(Applause)
p254
aa(lp255
VThank you.
p256
aa(lp257
VBut you learn lessons from these things that happen to you.
p258
aVI learned to be always there.
p259
aVThe first thing, I got out of jail,
p260
aVof course after I took a shower, I went online,
p261
aVI opened my Twitter account and my Facebook page,
p262
aVand I've been always very respectful
p263
aVto those people who are opining to me.
p264
aVI would listen to what they say,
p265
aVand I would never defend myself with words only.
p266
aVI would use actions. When they said I should withdraw from the campaign,
p267
aVI filed the first lawsuit against the general directorate
p268
aVof traffic police for not issuing me a driver's license.
p269
aVThere are a lot of people also \u2014
p270
aVvery big support, like those 3,000 people
p271
aVwho signed the petition to release me.
p272
aVWe sent a petition to the Shura Council
p273
aVin favor of lifting the ban on Saudi women,
p274
aVand there were, like, 3,500 citizens who believed in that
p275
aVand they signed that petition.
p276
aVThere were people like that, I just showed some examples,
p277
aVwho are amazing, who are believing in women's rights in Saudi Arabia,
p278
aVand trying, and they are also facing a lot of hate
p279
aVbecause of speaking up and voicing their views.
p280
aa(lp281
VSaudi Arabia today is taking small steps
p282
aVtoward enhancing women's rights.
p283
aVThe Shura Council that's appointed by the king,
p284
aVby royal decree of King Abdullah,
p285
aVlast year there were 30 women assigned to that Council,
p286
aVlike 20 percent.
p287
aV20 percent of the Council. (Applause)
p288
aVThe same time, finally, that Council,
p289
aVafter rejecting our petition four times for women driving,
p290
aVthey finally accepted it last February.
p291
aV(Applause)
p292
aVAfter being sent to jail
p293
aVor sentenced lashing, or sent to a trial,
p294
aVthe spokesperson of the traffic police said,
p295
aVwe will only issue traffic violation for women drivers.
p296
aVThe Grand Mufti, who is the head
p297
aVof the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia,
p298
aVhe said, it's not recommended for women to drive.
p299
aVIt used to be haram, forbidden, by the previous Grand Mufti.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo for me, it's not about only these small steps.
p302
aVIt's about women themselves.
p303
aa(lp304
VA friend once asked me, she said,
p305
aV"So when do you think this women driving will happen?"
p306
aa(lp307
VI told her, "Only if women stop asking 'When?'
p308
aVand take action to make it now."
p309
aa(lp310
VSo it's not only about the system,
p311
aVit's also about us women to drive our own life, I'd say.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo I have no clue, really, how I became an activist.
p314
aVAnd I don't know how I became one now.
p315
aVBut all I know, and all I'm sure of, in the future
p316
aVwhen someone asks me my story,
p317
aVI will say, "I'm proud
p318
aVto be amongst those women who lifted the ban,
p319
aVfought the ban, and celebrated everyone's freedom."
p320
aa(lp321
VSo the question I started my talk with,
p322
aVwho do you think is more difficult to face,
p323
aVoppressive governments or oppressive societies?
p324
aVI hope you find clues to answer that from my speech.
p325
aa(lp326
VThank you, everyone.
p327
aa(lp328
V(Applause)
p329
aVThank you.
p330
aV(Applause)
p331
aVThank you. (Applause)
