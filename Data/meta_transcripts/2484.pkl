VHow do you find a dinosaur?
p4
aVSounds impossible, doesn't it?
p5
aVIt's not.
p6
aVAnd the answer relies on a formula that all paleontologists use.
p7
aVAnd I'm going to tell you the secret.
p8
aa(lp9
VFirst, find rocks of the right age.
p10
aVSecond, those rocks must be sedimentary rocks.
p11
aVAnd third, layers of those rocks must be naturally exposed.
p12
aVThat's it.
p13
aVFind those three things and get yourself on the ground,
p14
aVchances are good that you will find fossils.
p15
aa(lp16
VNow let me break down this formula.
p17
aVOrganisms exist only during certain geological intervals.
p18
aVSo you have to find rocks of the right age,
p19
aVdepending on what your interests are.
p20
aVIf you want to find trilobites,
p21
aVyou have to find the really, really old rocks of the Paleozoic \u2014
p22
aVrocks between a half a billion and a quarter-billion years old.
p23
aVNow, if you want to find dinosaurs,
p24
aVdon't look in the Paleozoic, you won't find them.
p25
aVThey hadn't evolved yet.
p26
aVYou have to find the younger rocks of the Mesozoic,
p27
aVand in the case of dinosaurs,
p28
aVbetween 235 and 66 million years ago.
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, it's fairly easy to find rocks of the right age at this point,
p31
aVbecause the Earth is, to a coarse degree,
p32
aVgeologically mapped.
p33
aVThis is hard-won information.
p34
aVThe annals of Earth history are written in rocks,
p35
aVone chapter upon the next,
p36
aVsuch that the oldest pages are on bottom
p37
aVand the youngest on top.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow, were it quite that easy, geologists would rejoice.
p40
aVIt's not.
p41
aVThe library of Earth is an old one.
p42
aVIt has no librarian to impose order.
p43
aVOperating over vast swaths of time,
p44
aVmyriad geological processes offer every possible insult
p45
aVto the rocks of ages.
p46
aVMost pages are destroyed soon after being written.
p47
aVSome pages are overwritten,
p48
aVcreating difficult-to-decipher palimpsests of long-gone landscapes.
p49
aVPages that do find sanctuary under the advancing sands of time
p50
aVare never truly safe.
p51
aVUnlike the Moon \u2014 our dead, rocky companion \u2014
p52
aVthe Earth is alive, pulsing with creative and destructive forces
p53
aVthat power its geological metabolism.
p54
aVLunar rocks brought back by the Apollo astronauts
p55
aVall date back to about the age of the Solar System.
p56
aVMoon rocks are forever.
p57
aVEarth rocks, on the other hand, face the perils of a living lithosphere.
p58
aVAll will suffer ruination,
p59
aVthrough some combination of mutilation, compression,
p60
aVfolding, tearing, scorching and baking.
p61
aa(lp62
VThus, the volumes of Earth history are incomplete and disheveled.
p63
aVThe library is vast and magnificent \u2014
p64
aVbut decrepit.
p65
aVAnd it was this tattered complexity in the rock record
p66
aVthat obscured its meaning until relatively recently.
p67
aVNature provided no card catalog for geologists \u2014
p68
aVthis would have to be invented.
p69
aVFive thousand years after the Sumerians learned to record their thoughts
p70
aVon clay tablets,
p71
aVthe Earth's volumes remained inscrutable to humans.
p72
aVWe were geologically illiterate,
p73
aVunaware of the antiquity of our own planet
p74
aVand ignorant of our connection
p75
aVto deep time.
p76
aa(lp77
VIt wasn't until the turn of the 19th century
p78
aVthat our blinders were removed,
p79
aVfirst, with the publication of James Hutton's "Theory of the Earth,"
p80
aVin which he told us that the Earth reveals no vestige of a beginning
p81
aVand no prospect of an end;
p82
aVand then, with the printing of William Smith's map of Britain,
p83
aVthe first country-scale geological map,
p84
aVgiving us for the first time
p85
aVpredictive insight into where certain types of rocks might occur.
p86
aVAfter that, you could say things like,
p87
aV"If we go over there, we should be in the Jurassic,"
p88
aVor, "If we go up over that hill, we should find the Cretaceous."
p89
aa(lp90
VSo now, if you want to find trilobites,
p91
aVget yourself a good geological map
p92
aVand go to the rocks of the Paleozoic.
p93
aVIf you want to find dinosaurs like I do,
p94
aVfind the rocks of Mesozoic and go there.
p95
aVNow of course, you can only make a fossil in a sedimentary rock,
p96
aVa rock made by sand and mud.
p97
aVYou can't have a fossil
p98
aVin an igneous rock formed by magma, like a granite,
p99
aVor in a metamorphic rock that's been heated and squeezed.
p100
aVAnd you have to get yourself in a desert.
p101
aVIt's not that dinosaurs particularly lived in deserts;
p102
aVthey lived on every land mass
p103
aVand in every imaginable environment.
p104
aVIt's that you need to go to a place that's a desert today,
p105
aVa place that doesn't have too many plants covering up the rocks,
p106
aVand a place where erosion is always exposing new bones at the surface.
p107
aVSo find those three things:
p108
aVrocks of the right age,
p109
aVthat are sedimentary rocks, in a desert,
p110
aVand get yourself on the ground,
p111
aVand you literally walk
p112
aVuntil you see a bone sticking out of the rock.
p113
aa(lp114
VHere's a picture that I took in Southern Patagonia.
p115
aVEvery pebble that you see on the ground there
p116
aVis a piece of dinosaur bone.
p117
aVSo when you're in that right situation,
p118
aVit's not a question of whether you'll find fossils or not;
p119
aVyou're going to find fossils.
p120
aVThe question is: Will you find something that is scientifically significant?
p121
aVAnd to help with that, I'm going to add a fourth part to our formula,
p122
aVwhich is this:
p123
aVget as far away from other paleontologists as possible.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VIt's not that I don't like other paleontologists.
p128
aVWhen you go to a place that's relatively unexplored,
p129
aVyou have a much better chance of not only finding fossils
p130
aVbut of finding something that's new to science.
p131
aVSo that's my formula for finding dinosaurs,
p132
aVand I've applied it all around the world.
p133
aa(lp134
VIn the austral summer of 2004,
p135
aVI went to the bottom of South America,
p136
aVto the bottom of Patagonia, Argentina,
p137
aVto prospect for dinosaurs:
p138
aVa place that had terrestrial sedimentary rocks of the right age,
p139
aVin a desert,
p140
aVa place that had been barely visited by paleontologists.
p141
aVAnd we found this.
p142
aVThis is a femur, a thigh bone,
p143
aVof a giant, plant-eating dinosaur.
p144
aVThat bone is 2.2 meters across.
p145
aVThat's over seven feet long.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow, unfortunately, that bone was isolated.
p148
aVWe dug and dug and dug, and there wasn't another bone around.
p149
aVBut it made us hungry to go back the next year for more.
p150
aVAnd on the first day of that next field season,
p151
aVI found this: another two-meter femur,
p152
aVonly this time not isolated,
p153
aVthis time associated with 145 other bones
p154
aVof a giant plant eater.
p155
aVAnd after three more hard, really brutal field seasons,
p156
aVthe quarry came to look like this.
p157
aVAnd there you see the tail of that great beast wrapping around me.
p158
aVThe giant that lay in this grave, the new species of dinosaur,
p159
aVwe would eventually call "Dreadnoughtus schrani."
p160
aVDreadnoughtus was 85 feet from snout to tail.
p161
aVIt stood two-and-a-half stories at the shoulder,
p162
aVand all fleshed out in life, it weighed 65 tons.
p163
aVPeople ask me sometimes, "Was Dreadnoughtus bigger than a T. rex?"
p164
aVThat's the mass of eight or nine T. rex.
p165
aa(lp166
VNow, one of the really cool things about being a paleontologist
p167
aVis when you find a new species, you get to name it.
p168
aVAnd I've always thought it a shame that these giant, plant-eating dinosaurs
p169
aVare too often portrayed as passive, lumbering platters of meat
p170
aVon the landscape.
p171
aa(lp172
V(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VThey're not.
p175
aVBig herbivores can be surly, and they can be territorial \u2014
p176
aVyou do not want to mess with a hippo or a rhino or a water buffalo.
p177
aVThe bison in Yellowstone injure far more people than do the grizzly bears.
p178
aVSo can you imagine a big bull, 65-ton Dreadnoughtus
p179
aVin the breeding season,
p180
aVdefending a territory?
p181
aVThat animal would have been incredibly dangerous,
p182
aVa menace to all around, and itself would have had nothing to fear.
p183
aVAnd thus the name, "Dreadnoughtus,"
p184
aVor, "fears nothing."
p185
aa(lp186
VNow, to grow so large,
p187
aVan animal like Dreadnoughtus would've had to have been
p188
aVa model of efficiency.
p189
aVThat long neck and long tail help it radiate heat into the environment,
p190
aVpassively controlling its temperature.
p191
aVAnd that long neck also serves as a super-efficient feeding mechanism.
p192
aVDreadnoughtus could stand in one place and with that neck
p193
aVclear out a huge envelope of vegetation,
p194
aVtaking in tens of thousands of calories while expending very few.
p195
aVAnd these animals evolved a bulldog-like wide-gait stance,
p196
aVgiving them immense stability,
p197
aVbecause when you're 65 tons, when you're literally as big as a house,
p198
aVthe penalty for falling over
p199
aVis death.
p200
aVYeah, these animals are big and tough,
p201
aVbut they won't take a blow like that.
p202
aVDreadnoughtus falls over, ribs break and pierce lungs.
p203
aVOrgans burst.
p204
aVIf you're a big 65-ton Dreadnoughtus,
p205
aVyou don't get to fall down in life \u2014 even once.
p206
aa(lp207
VNow, after this particular Dreadnoughtus carcass was buried
p208
aVand de-fleshed by a multitude of bacteria, worms and insects,
p209
aVits bones underwent a brief metamorphosis,
p210
aVexchanging molecules with the groundwater
p211
aVand becoming more and more like the entombing rock.
p212
aVAs layer upon layer of sediment accumulated,
p213
aVpressure from all sides weighed in like a stony glove
p214
aVwhose firm and enduring grip held each bone in a stabilizing embrace.
p215
aa(lp216
VAnd then came the long ...
p217
aVnothing.
p218
aVEpoch after epoch of sameness,
p219
aVnonevents without number.
p220
aVAll the while, the skeleton lay everlasting and unchanging
p221
aVin perfect equilibrium
p222
aVwithin its rocky grave.
p223
aVMeanwhile, Earth history unfolded above.
p224
aVThe dinosaurs would reign for another 12 million years
p225
aVbefore their hegemony was snuffed out in a fiery apocalypse.
p226
aVThe continents drifted. The mammals rose.
p227
aVThe Ice Age came.
p228
aa(lp229
VAnd then, in East Africa,
p230
aVan unpromising species of ape evolved the odd trick of sentient thought.
p231
aVThese brainy primates were not particularly fast or strong.
p232
aVBut they excelled at covering ground,
p233
aVand in a remarkable diaspora
p234
aVsurpassing even the dinosaurs' record of territorial conquest,
p235
aVthey dispersed across the planet,
p236
aVravishing every ecosystem they encountered,
p237
aValong the way, inventing culture and metalworking and painting
p238
aVand dance and music
p239
aVand science
p240
aVand rocket ships that would eventually take 12 particularly excellent apes
p241
aVto the surface of the Moon.
p242
aa(lp243
VWith seven billion peripatetic Homo sapiens on the planet,
p244
aVit was perhaps inevitable
p245
aVthat one of them would eventually trod on the grave of the magnificent titan
p246
aVburied beneath the badlands of Southern Patagonia.
p247
aVI was that ape.
p248
aVAnd standing there, alone in the desert,
p249
aVit was not lost on me
p250
aVthat the chance of any one individual entering the fossil record
p251
aVis vanishingly small.
p252
aVBut the Earth is very, very old.
p253
aVAnd over vast tracts of time, the improbable becomes the probable.
p254
aVThat's the magic of the geological record.
p255
aVThus, multitudinous creatures living and dying on an old planet
p256
aVleave behind immense numbers of fossils,
p257
aVeach one a small miracle,
p258
aVbut collectively, inevitable.
p259
aa(lp260
VSixty-six million years ago, an asteroid hits the Earth
p261
aVand wipes out the dinosaurs.
p262
aVThis easily might not have been.
p263
aVBut we only get one history, and it's the one that we have.
p264
aVBut this particular reality was not inevitable.
p265
aVThe tiniest perturbation of that asteroid far from Earth
p266
aVwould have caused it to miss our planet by a wide margin.
p267
aVThe pivotal, calamitous day during which the dinosaurs were wiped out,
p268
aVsetting the stage for the modern world as we know it
p269
aVdidn't have to be.
p270
aVIt could've just been another day \u2014
p271
aVa Thursday, perhaps \u2014
p272
aVamong the 63 billion days already enjoyed by the dinosaurs.
p273
aVBut over geological time,
p274
aVimprobable, nearly impossible events
p275
aVdo occur.
p276
aVAlong the path from our wormy, Cambrian ancestors
p277
aVto primates dressed in suits,
p278
aVinnumerable forks in the road led us to this very particular reality.
p279
aVThe bones of Dreadnoughtus lay underground for 77 million years.
p280
aVWho could have imagined
p281
aVthat a single species of shrew-like mammal
p282
aVliving in the cracks of the dinosaur world
p283
aVwould evolve into sentient beings
p284
aVcapable of characterizing and understanding
p285
aVthe very dinosaurs they must have dreaded?
p286
aa(lp287
VI once stood at the head of the Missouri River
p288
aVand bestraddled it.
p289
aVThere, it's nothing more than a gurgle of water
p290
aVthat issues forth from beneath a rock in a boulder in a pasture,
p291
aVhigh in the Bitterroot Mountains.
p292
aVThe stream next to it runs a few hundred yards
p293
aVand ends in a small pond.
p294
aVThose two streams \u2014 they look identical.
p295
aVBut one is an anonymous trickle of water,
p296
aVand the other is the Missouri River.
p297
aVNow go down to the mouth of the Missouri, near St. Louis,
p298
aVand it's pretty obvious that that river is a big deal.
p299
aVBut go up into the Bitterroots and look at the Missouri,
p300
aVand human prospection does not allow us to see it as anything special.
p301
aVNow go back to the Cretaceous Period
p302
aVand look at our tiny, fuzzball ancestors.
p303
aVYou would never guess
p304
aVthat they would amount to anything special,
p305
aVand they probably wouldn't have,
p306
aVwere it not for that pesky asteroid.
p307
aa(lp308
VNow, make a thousand more worlds and a thousand more solar systems
p309
aVand let them run.
p310
aVYou will never get the same result.
p311
aVNo doubt, those worlds would be both amazing and amazingly improbable,
p312
aVbut they would not be our world and they would not have our history.
p313
aVThere are an infinite number of histories that we could've had.
p314
aVWe only get one, and wow, did we ever get a good one.
p315
aVDinosaurs like Dreadnoughtus were real.
p316
aVSea monsters like the mosasaur were real.
p317
aVDragonflies with the wingspan of an eagle and pill bugs the length of a car
p318
aVreally existed.
p319
aa(lp320
VWhy study the ancient past?
p321
aVBecause it gives us perspective
p322
aVand humility.
p323
aVThe dinosaurs died in the world's fifth mass extinction,
p324
aVsnuffed out in a cosmic accident through no fault of their own.
p325
aVThey didn't see it coming, and they didn't have a choice.
p326
aVWe, on the other hand, do have a choice.
p327
aVAnd the nature of the fossil record tells us that our place on this planet
p328
aVis both precarious and potentially fleeting.
p329
aVRight now, our species is propagating an environmental disaster
p330
aVof geological proportions that is so broad and so severe,
p331
aVit can rightly be called the sixth extinction.
p332
aVOnly unlike the dinosaurs,
p333
aVwe can see it coming.
p334
aVAnd unlike the dinosaurs,
p335
aVwe can do something about it.
p336
aVThat choice is ours.
p337
