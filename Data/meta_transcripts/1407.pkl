(lp3
VThank y'all!
p4
aa(lp5
VThis is going to be a motivational speech.
p6
aVBecause \u2014
p7
aVimagine my motivation standing between this strong, healthy crowd ...
p8
aVand lunch.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VSo ...
p13
aVI'm @Falkvinge on Twitter.
p14
aVFeel free to quote me if I say something memorable, stupid, funny, whatever.
p15
aVI love seeing my name on Twitter.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo ...
p18
aVHi! I'm Rick.
p19
aVI'm a politician.
p20
aVI'm sorry.
p21
aVHow many in here have heard of the Swedish Pirate Party before?
p22
aVLet's see a show of hands.
p23
aVOK, that's practically everybody.
p24
aVProbably due to the fact that we are Sweden's neighbor.
p25
aa(lp26
VI frequently ask how many have heard of any other political party
p27
aVand there's always just scattered hands in the audience
p28
aVcompared to this first question which is one-half to two-thirds.
p29
aVThis is actually the first time ever that does not match.
p30
aVIt was practically everybody.
p31
aa(lp32
VSo, for those who haven't heard of us:
p33
aVwell, the Pirate Party, we love the net.
p34
aVWe love copying and sharing, and we love civil liberties.
p35
aVFor that, some people call us pirates.
p36
aVProbably in an attempt to make us bow our heads and feel shame.
p37
aVThat didn't work very well.
p38
aVWe decided to stand tall about it instead.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd so in 2006, I founded a new political party.
p41
aVI led it for its first five years.
p42
aVAnd the European elections, the last European elections,
p43
aVwe became the largest party
p44
aVand the most coveted youth demographic, sub-30.
p45
aVAnd what's interesting is we did that
p46
aVon less than one percent of the competition's budget.
p47
aVWe had a campaign budget total of 50,000 euros.
p48
aVThey had six million between them \u2014 and we beat them.
p49
aVThat gave us a cost efficiency advantage of over two orders of magnitude.
p50
aVAnd I'm gonna share the secret recipe of how we did that.
p51
aa(lp52
VWe developed swarm methodologies.
p53
aVAnd they can be applied to any business or social cause.
p54
aVWell, almost any \u2014
p55
aVthere's a small asterisk by the end,
p56
aVand I'll get to that in just a minute.
p57
aVBut applying these \u2014
p58
aVand we've done this dozens of times, we know that this works.
p59
aa(lp60
VWe've put two people in the European Parliament,
p61
aVwe have 45 people in various German state parliaments,
p62
aVwe're in the Icelandic parliament, the Czech senate,
p63
aVmany, many, many more, local councils \u2014
p64
aVand, as said, we've spread to 70 countries.
p65
aVAnd that's not bad for a political movement
p66
aVthat hasn't even been around for a decade.
p67
aa(lp68
VSo today we're going to talk a bit about \u2014
p69
aVhow people are motivated to be part of change,
p70
aVto be part of something bigger than themselves.
p71
aVAnd how you can channel this into an organization
p72
aVthat harnesses this great power of wanting to make the world a better place.
p73
aVAnd in the end, come out a little on the better.
p74
aa(lp75
VWhen I speak to businesspeople, I frequently make them very upset
p76
aVwhen I contradict them
p77
aVand say that no, your employees are not your most valuable asset.
p78
aVYour most valuable asset is the thousands of people
p79
aVwho want to work for you for free.
p80
aVAnd you don't let them.
p81
aVThey get very upset about that.
p82
aa(lp83
VA swarm is a congregation of tens of thousands of volunteers
p84
aVthat have chosen of their own will to converge on a common goal.
p85
aVThere's this "Futurama" quote:
p86
aV"When push comes to shove, you gotta do what you love \u2014
p87
aVeven if it's not a good idea."
p88
aa(lp89
V(Laughter)
p90
aa(lp91
VI mean, seriously, what kind of idiot thinks
p92
aVthey can change the world by starting a political party?
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VThis kind of idiot, apparently.
p97
aVBut it works!
p98
aVWhat you need to do is to put a stake in the ground.
p99
aVYou need to announce your goal.
p100
aVJust say, "I want to accomplish this."
p101
aVI'm going to do this.
p102
aVAnd it doesn't need to be very costly.
p103
aa(lp104
VMy announcement was just two lines in a chat channel.
p105
aV"Hey, look, the Pirate Party has its website up now after New Year's."
p106
aVAnd the address.
p107
aVThat was all the advertising I ever did.
p108
aVThe next time I had several hundred activists wanting to work with us.
p109
aa(lp110
VWhen you provide such a focus point,
p111
aVa swarm intelligence emerges.
p112
aVWhen people can rally to a flag.
p113
aVAnd that's what gives you this two orders of magnitude of cost efficiency.
p114
aVIt's a huge advantage \u2014
p115
aVyou're running circles around all the legacy organizations.
p116
aVAnd there are four goals that need to be fulfilled in your goal
p117
aVin order for this to work.
p118
aa(lp119
VThese four criteria are that your goal must be:
p120
aVtangible, credible, inclusive and epic.
p121
aa(lp122
VLet's take a look at them: It needs to be tangible.
p123
aVA lot of people say,
p124
aV"Well, you know, we should make the world a better place,"
p125
aVor, "Yeah, we should all feel good now."
p126
aVNot going to work.
p127
aVYou need a binary.
p128
aVAre we there yet, or are we not there yet?
p129
aa(lp130
VIt needs to be credible.
p131
aVSomebody seeing the project plan that you're posting needs to see
p132
aVthat, yes, this project plan will take us
p133
aVfrom where we are to where we want to be.
p134
aVYou need to break it down into subgoals
p135
aVthat each by themselves are seen as doable,
p136
aVand when you add the subgoals together,
p137
aVwe've gone to where we want.
p138
aa(lp139
VIt needs to be \u2014
p140
aVand this is where it gets exciting in terms of working swarmwise \u2014
p141
aVit needs to be inclusive.
p142
aVAnybody who sees this project plan needs to immediately say,
p143
aV"I want to do this \u2014 and there's my spot!"
p144
aVAnd they will be able to jump right into the project
p145
aVand start working on it without asking anybody's permission.
p146
aVAnd that is exactly what'll happen.
p147
aa(lp148
VAnd, last but not least, it needs to be epic.
p149
aVIt needs to energize people. It needs to electrify people.
p150
aVShoot for the moon!
p151
aVOn second thought, don't shoot for the moon,
p152
aVwe've already been there \u2014 shoot for Mars!
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VIn contrast,
p157
aVyou will never be able to get a volunteer swarm forming
p158
aVaround making the most correct tax audit ever.
p159
aVDoesn't electrify people. Go to Mars.
p160
aa(lp161
VA lot of people kind of balk at the obstacles.
p162
aVWe're going to climb a huge mountain.
p163
aVSo how do you motivate people to do that?
p164
aVWell, it turns out that obstacles are not the problem.
p165
aVNot knowing the obstacles is the problem.
p166
aVIf you know how high the mountain is,
p167
aVyou know exactly what it takes to scale it.
p168
aVWe know exactly how far away Mars is and what it takes to get there.
p169
aVIf you can plan it like a project,
p170
aVyou can plan what resources you need
p171
aVand you can execute it, exactly like a project.
p172
aa(lp173
VLet's see: we're going to Mars,
p174
aVwe need two dozen volunteer rocket scientists,
p175
aVone dozen volunteer metallurgists,
p176
aVsome crazy dude who will mix rocket fuel in his backyard
p177
aVand so on.
p178
aa(lp179
VWhen you can list the resources, you know what you need to get there.
p180
aVWhen you know what you need to get there, you can go there.
p181
aVAnd the next thing is to encourage this development of a swarm intelligence,
p182
aVwhich is where the cost efficiency comes in.
p183
aa(lp184
VThere's a TED Talk on motivation that debunks that we work for money,
p185
aVand it presents science on how we're really motivated by three things,
p186
aVin terms of larger creative tasks,
p187
aVwhen we work for something bigger than ourselves.
p188
aa(lp189
VWe work for autonomy, mastery and purpose.
p190
aVWe've covered purpose already.
p191
aVAs in, working for something bigger, tangible, credible, inclusive and epic.
p192
aVSo, where that motivation talk ends,
p193
aVwhat it doesn't answer is,
p194
aVhow do you build an organization that harnesses this motivational power.
p195
aVAnd this is where working swarmwise comes in,
p196
aVthis is where swarm intelligence comes in.
p197
aVTurns out that there are three factors that you optimize for \u2014
p198
aVand each of these are in complete opposite to what you learn at a business school.
p199
aVBut it works.
p200
aVWe know it works.
p201
aVWe have people in many, many parliaments to prove it.
p202
aa(lp203
VThose three factors are: speed, trust and scalability.
p204
aVWe optimize for speed by cutting bottlenecks out of the loop,
p205
aVcutting them out of the decision loop.
p206
aVThat means cutting yourself out of the decision loop,
p207
aVwhich can be hard.
p208
aVBut you've got to communicate your vision so passionately, so strongly,
p209
aVthat everybody knows what the goal is
p210
aVand can find something, some step
p211
aVthat takes the movement just a little closer to that goal.
p212
aVAnd when tens of thousands of people do that on a weekly basis,
p213
aVyou become an unstoppable force.
p214
aa(lp215
VWe had a three-person rule in our organization,
p216
aVsaying that if three self-identified volunteers in the movement
p217
aVwere in agreement that something was good for the movement,
p218
aVthey had the green light from the highest office
p219
aVto go ahead and act in the name of the organization,
p220
aVincluding spending resources.
p221
aVWhen you talk about this kind of empowerment
p222
aVto traditional businesspeople,
p223
aVthey think you belong in a zoo.
p224
aVBut you know what?
p225
aVI led this organization for five years,
p226
aVthere were 50,000 registered members
p227
aVand many, many more anonymous activists.
p228
aVIt was not abused once.
p229
aVEverybody had the key to the treasure chest.
p230
aVIt was not abused one single time.
p231
aa(lp232
VTurns out when you give people the keys to the castle,
p233
aVand look them in the eye and say, "I trust you,"
p234
aVthey step up to the plate.
p235
aVAnd that's a beautiful thing to see happen.
p236
aa(lp237
VObviously, not everything went according to plan,
p238
aVbut that's a different thing.
p239
aVWe made mistakes. We should expect mistakes.
p240
aVIf you're pioneering something, that means you must, by definition,
p241
aVventure into the unknown.
p242
aVWhen you're trying the unknown, some things won't go as planned.
p243
aVThat's part of the definition of venturing into the unknown.
p244
aVTo find the great, you must allow mistakes to happen.
p245
aVSo you must communicate that we expect some things to go wrong
p246
aVto create a risk-positive environment.
p247
aVTherefore we optimize for iteration speed.
p248
aVMeaning that we try, we fail, we try again, we fail faster,
p249
aVwe fail better, we try again, we fail better again.
p250
aVMaybe after we've tried 15 times, we've mastered some specific subject,
p251
aVso you want to minimize the time it takes to try those 15 times.
p252
aa(lp253
VWe optimize on trust. We encourage diversity.
p254
aVYou need to communicate your vision so strongly
p255
aVso that everybody can translate it into their own context
p256
aVbecause language is an incredibly strong
p257
aVinclusionary and exclusionary social marker.
p258
aVThis one-brand-fits-all message \u2014
p259
aVforget it!
p260
aVThat's what they teach you at business school \u2014 it doesn't work.
p261
aVOr at least, it doesn't give you the cost-efficiency advantage
p262
aVof working swarmwise.
p263
aa(lp264
VThis leads to a lot of different approaches tried in parallel
p265
aVin different social groups
p266
aVwho try out different methods of working toward the goal.
p267
aVSome of them will work
p268
aVbut in order to find the great ones, you need this diversity.
p269
aVAnd you need to communicate that we need that diversity.
p270
aVIf somebody on this side does not understand
p271
aVwhat those guys are doing,
p272
aVthat's OK because we all trust each other to work for the better of the movement.
p273
aVAnd it's OK that I don't understand their social context.
p274
aVI'm not expected to \u2014 I understand my social context.
p275
aVI contribute with something I know.
p276
aVMake people aware of this diversity.
p277
aa(lp278
VFinally, scalability. Get feet on the ground.
p279
aVAgain, in business school, they teach you to use a lean organization.
p280
aVForget that.
p281
aVJust scale up the organization from the get-go.
p282
aVStart with 10,000 empty boxes and an org chart
p283
aVcovering down to every minor city.
p284
aVWhen you have lots and lots of small responsibilities
p285
aVin such a scaffolding that supports the swarm,
p286
aVsupports the activists,
p287
aVyou'll find that these boxes in the org charts
p288
aVare getting filled in quite rapidly,
p289
aVand they start to get filled in beyond your horizon
p290
aVwith people you've never heard of.
p291
aVAnd so, this swarm keeps growing to tens of thousands of people,
p292
aVeach taking on something small with very, very decentralized mandate
p293
aVto act on the organization.
p294
aVAnd this is when a swarm intelligence emerges.
p295
aVThis is when you have this beehive logic where everybody knows what's to be done.
p296
aVEverybody is taking their own small steps towards it.
p297
aVSo the swarm starts to act as a coherent organism.
p298
aVAnd it's amazing to watch.
p299
aVThis is when you're awarded by the cost-efficiency advantage
p300
aVover your competitors
p301
aVby two orders of magnitude.
p302
aVTwo orders of magnitude.
p303
aVThis is not just a silver bullet.
p304
aa(lp305
VSo we've been talking a lot about the big picture today.
p306
aVYou can use these swarm methods for a lot of stuff.
p307
aVDo you want to change the world?
p308
aVDo you want to bring clean water to a billion people?
p309
aVTeach three billion people to read?
p310
aVMaybe you're into social change;
p311
aVyou want to introduce unconditional basic income.
p312
aVOr maybe you want to take humanity to Mars.
p313
aVYou can do this using these methods.
p314
aa(lp315
VYou can do this.
p316
aVIt's about leadership.
p317
aVIt's about deciding what you want to do and telling it to the world.
p318
aVBecause no matter whether you think you can or cannot change the world,
p319
aVno matter whether you think you can or cannot change the world,
p320
aVyou are probably right.
p321
aa(lp322
VSo one question I want everybody here to ask themselves today
p323
aVis the observation that change doesn't just happen, somebody makes it happen \u2014
p324
aVdo you want to be that person?
p325
aVDo you want to be that person?
p326
aa(lp327
VAnd then one last thing:
p328
aVThere's one component more that's required to work swarmwise
p329
aVthat I haven't mentioned yet.
p330
aVAnd that is fun.
p331
aVThis goes beyond just enjoying your job,
p332
aVthis goes beyond having a pinball machine in the office.
p333
aVBecause this is actually required to succeed in a swarmwise scenario.
p334
aVThis is required to succeed
p335
aVto get that cost-efficiency advantage of two orders of magnitude.
p336
aVFor the reason that you need to attract volunteers.
p337
aVAnd people, in this aspect, are rather predictable.
p338
aVPeople will go to other people who are having fun.
p339
aVIn contrast, they will walk an extra mile to avoid people who are not having fun.
p340
aVSo, having fun is more than just having a pinball machine in the office.
p341
aVIt's an absolute and unavoidable requirement
p342
aVfor organizational and operational success when you're working swarmwise.
p343
aa(lp344
VSo, in summary \u2014
p345
aVa recipe for a swarm organization
p346
aVusing these motivational methods to a huge competitive advantage.
p347
aVYour goal: it needs to be tangible, credible, inclusive and epic.
p348
aVYour organization needs to be optimized for speed, trust and scalability.
p349
aVYou need to enjoy yourselves.
p350
aVAnd that will reward you
p351
aVwith two orders of magnitude of cost-efficiency advantage.
p352
aa(lp353
VThank you.
