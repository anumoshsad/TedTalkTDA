VI love paper, and I love technology,
p4
aVand what I do is I make paper interactive.
p5
aVAnd that's what I say when people ask me what I do,
p6
aVbut it really confuses most people,
p7
aVso really, the best way for me to convey it
p8
aVis to take the technology and be creative
p9
aVand create experiences.
p10
aVSo I tried to think what I could use for here,
p11
aVand a couple of weeks ago I had a crazy idea
p12
aVthat I wanted to print two DJ decks
p13
aVand to try and mix some music.
p14
aVAnd I'm going to try and show that at the end,
p15
aVand the suspense will be as much mine if it works.
p16
aVAnd I'm not a DJ, and I'm not a musician,
p17
aVso I'm a little bit scared of that.
p18
aVSo I think, I found the best way to describe my journey
p19
aVis just to mention a few little things
p20
aVthat have happened to me throughout my life.
p21
aVThere's three particular things that I've done,
p22
aVand I'll just describe those first,
p23
aVand then talk about some of my work.
p24
aVSo when I was a kid, I was obsessed with wires,
p25
aVand I used to thread them under my carpet
p26
aVand thread them behind the walls
p27
aVand have little switches and little speakers,
p28
aVand I wanted to make my bedroom be interactive
p29
aVbut kind of all hidden away.
p30
aVAnd I was also really interested in wireless as well.
p31
aVSo I bought one of those little kits that you could get
p32
aVto make a radio transmitter,
p33
aVand I got an old book and I carved out the inside
p34
aVand I hid it inside there,
p35
aVand then I placed it next to my dad
p36
aVand snuck back to my bedroom and tuned in on the radio
p37
aVso I could eavesdrop.
p38
aVI was not at all interested in what he was saying.
p39
aVIt's more that I just liked the idea
p40
aVof an everyday object
p41
aVhaving something inside
p42
aVand doing something different.
p43
aVSeveral year later,
p44
aVI managed to successfully fail all of my exams
p45
aVand didn't really leave school with much to show for at all,
p46
aVand my parents, maybe as a reward,
p47
aVbought me what turned out to be
p48
aVa one-way ticket to Australia,
p49
aVand I came back home about four years later.
p50
aVI ended up on a farm in the middle of nowhere.
p51
aVIt was in far western New South Wales.
p52
aVAnd this farm was 120,000 acres.
p53
aVThere were 22,000 sheep,
p54
aVand it was about 40 degrees,
p55
aVor 100 or so Fahrenheit.
p56
aVAnd on this farm there was the farmer, his wife,
p57
aVand there was the four-year-old daughter.
p58
aVAnd they kind of took me into the farm
p59
aVand showed me what it was like to live and work.
p60
aVObviously, one of the most important things was the sheep,
p61
aVand so my job was, well, pretty much to do everything,
p62
aVbut it was about bringing the sheep back to the homestead.
p63
aVAnd we'd do that by building fences,
p64
aVusing motorbikes and horses,
p65
aVand the sheep would make their way all the way back
p66
aVto the shearing shed for the different seasons.
p67
aVAnd what I learned was,
p68
aValthough at the time, like everyone else,
p69
aVI thought sheep were pretty stupid
p70
aVbecause they didn't do what we wanted them to do,
p71
aVwhat I realize now, probably only just in the last few weeks
p72
aVlooking back, is the sheep weren't stupid at all.
p73
aVWe'd put them in an environment where they didn't want to be,
p74
aVand they didn't want to do what we wanted them to do.
p75
aVSo the challenge was to try and get them
p76
aVto do what we wanted them to do
p77
aVby listening to the weather, the lay of the land,
p78
aVand creating things that would let the sheep flow
p79
aVand go where we wanted them to go.
p80
aVAnother bunch of years later,
p81
aVI ended up at Cambridge University
p82
aVat the Cavendish Laboratory in the U.K.
p83
aVdoing a Ph.D. in physics.
p84
aVMy Ph.D. was to move electrons around, one at a time.
p85
aVAnd I realize \u2014 again, it's kind of these realizations
p86
aVlooking back as to what I did \u2014
p87
aVI realize now that it was pretty much the same
p88
aVas moving sheep around.
p89
aVIt really is.
p90
aVIt's just you do it by changing an environment.
p91
aVAnd that's kind of been a big lesson to me,
p92
aVthat you can't act on any object.
p93
aVYou change its environment, and the object will flow.
p94
aVSo we made it very small,
p95
aVso things were about 30 nanometers in size;
p96
aVmaking it very cold, so at liquid helium temperatures;
p97
aVand changing environment by changing the voltage,
p98
aVand the electrons could make flow around a loop
p99
aVone at a time, on and off, a little memory node.
p100
aVAnd I wanted to go one step further,
p101
aVand I wanted to move one electron on
p102
aVand one electron off.
p103
aVAnd I was told that I wouldn't be able to do this,
p104
aVwhich, you know, as we've heard from other people,
p105
aVthat's the thing that makes you do it.
p106
aVAnd I was determined, and I managed to show that I could do that.
p107
aVAnd a lot of that learning, I think,
p108
aVcame from being on that farm,
p109
aVbecause when I was working on the farm,
p110
aVwe'd have to use what was around us,
p111
aVwe'd have to use the environment,
p112
aVand there was no such thing
p113
aVas something can't be done,
p114
aVbecause you're in an environment where,
p115
aVif you can't do what you need to do,
p116
aVyou can die, and, you know,
p117
aVI had seen that sort of thing happen.
p118
aVSo now my obsession is printing,
p119
aVand I'm really fascinated by the idea
p120
aVof using conventional printing processes,
p121
aVso the types of print that are used to create
p122
aVmany of the things around us
p123
aVto make paper and card interactive.
p124
aVWhen I spoke to some printers when I started doing this
p125
aVand told them what I wanted to do,
p126
aVwhich was to print conductive inks onto paper,
p127
aVthey told me it couldn't be done,
p128
aVagain, that kind of favorite thing.
p129
aVSo I got about 10 credit cards and loans
p130
aVand got myself very close to bankruptcy, really,
p131
aVand bought myself this huge printing press,
p132
aVwhich I had no idea how to use at all.
p133
aVIt was about five meters long,
p134
aVand I covered myself and the floor with ink
p135
aVand made a massive mess, but I learned to print.
p136
aVAnd then I took it back to the printers and showed them what I've done,
p137
aVand they were like, "Of course you can do that.
p138
aVWhy didn't you come here in the first place?"
p139
aVThat's always the case.
p140
aVSo what we do is we take conventional printing presses,
p141
aVwe make conductive inks,
p142
aVand run those through a press, and basically
p143
aVjust letting hundreds of thousands of electrons flow
p144
aVthrough pieces of paper
p145
aVso we can make that paper interactive.
p146
aVAnd it's pretty simple, really.
p147
aVIt's just a collection of things that have been done before,
p148
aVbut bringing them together in a different way.
p149
aVSo we have a piece of paper with conductive ink on,
p150
aVand then add onto that a small circuit board with a couple of chips,
p151
aVone to run some capacitive touch software,
p152
aVso we know where we've touched it,
p153
aVand the other to run, quite often,
p154
aVsome wireless software so the piece of paper can connect.
p155
aVSo I'll just describe a couple of things that we've created.
p156
aVThere's lots of different things we've created.
p157
aVThis is one of them, because I love cake.
p158
aVAnd this one, it's a large poster,
p159
aVand you touch it and it has a little speaker behind it,
p160
aVand the poster talks to you when you touch it
p161
aVand asks you a series of questions,
p162
aVand it works out your perfect cake.
p163
aVBut it doesn't tell you the cake there and then.
p164
aVIt uploads a picture,
p165
aVand the reason why it chose that cake for you,
p166
aVto our Facebook page and to Twitter.
p167
aVSo we're trying to create that connection
p168
aVbetween the physical and the digital,
p169
aVbut have it not looking on a screen,
p170
aVand just looking like a regular poster.
p171
aVWe've worked with a bunch of universities on a project
p172
aVlooking at interactive newsprint.
p173
aVSo for example, we've created a newspaper,
p174
aVa regular newspaper.
p175
aVYou can wear a pair of headphones that are connected to it wirelessly,
p176
aVand when you touch it, you can hear the music
p177
aVthat's described on the top, which is something you can't read.
p178
aVYou can hear a press conference
p179
aVas well as reading what the editor has determined
p180
aVthat press conference was about.
p181
aVAnd you can press a Facebook "like" button
p182
aVor you can vote on something as well.
p183
aVSomething else that we created,
p184
aVand this was an idea that I had a couple of years ago,
p185
aVand so we've done a project on this.
p186
aVIt was for funding from the government
p187
aVfor user-centered design for energy-efficient buildings,
p188
aVdifficult to say, and something I had no idea what it was
p189
aVwhen I went into the workshop, but quickly learned.
p190
aVAnd we wanted to try and encourage people
p191
aVto use energy better.
p192
aVAnd I really liked the idea that, instead of looking at dials
p193
aVand reading things to say \u2014
p194
aVlooking at your energy usage,
p195
aVI wanted to create a poster that was wirelessly connected
p196
aVand had color-changing inks on it,
p197
aVand so if your energy usage was trending better,
p198
aVthan the leaves would appear and the rabbits would appear
p199
aVand all would be good.
p200
aVAnd if it wasn't, then there'd be graffiti
p201
aVand the leaves would fall off the trees.
p202
aVSo it was trying to make you look after something
p203
aVin your immediate environment,
p204
aVwhich you don't want to see not looking so good,
p205
aVrather than expecting people to do things
p206
aVin the local environment because of the effect
p207
aVthat it has a long way off.
p208
aVAnd I think, kind of like going back to the farm,
p209
aVit's about how to let people do what you want them to do
p210
aVrather than making people do what you want them to do.
p211
aVOkay.
p212
aVSo this is the bit I'm really scared of.
p213
aVSo a couple of things I've created are,
p214
aVthere's a poster over here
p215
aVthat you can play drums on.
p216
aVAnd I am not a musician. It seemed like a good idea at the time.
p217
aVIf anyone wants to try and play drums, then they can.
p218
aVI'll just describe how this works.
p219
aVThis poster is wirelessly connected to my cell phone,
p220
aVand when you touch it, it connects to the app.
p221
aV(Drums)
p222
aVAnd it has really good response time.
p223
aVIt's using Bluetooth 4, so it's pretty instantaneous.
p224
aVOkay. Thanks.
p225
aV(Applause)
p226
aVAnd there's a couple of other things.
p227
aVSo this one is like a sound board,
p228
aVso you can touch it, and I just love these horrible noises.
p229
aV(Sirens, explosions, breaking glass)
p230
aVOkay, and this is a D.J. turntable.
p231
aVSo it's wirelessly linked to my iPad,
p232
aVand this is a software that's running on the iPad.
p233
aVOh, yes. I just love doing that.
p234
aVI'm not a D.J., though, but I just always wanted to do that.
p235
aV(Scratching)
p236
aVSo I have a crossfader, and I have the two decks.
p237
aVSo I've made some new technology,
p238
aVand I love things being creative,
p239
aVand I love working with creative people.
p240
aVSo my 15-year-old niece, she's amazing,
p241
aVand she's called Charlotte,
p242
aVand I asked her to record something,
p243
aVand I worked with a friend called Elliot
p244
aVto put some beats together.
p245
aVSo this is my niece, Charlotte.
p246
aV(Music)
p247
aVYay!
p248
aV(Applause)
p249
aVSo that's pretty much what I do.
p250
aVI just love bringing technology together,
p251
aVhaving a lot of fun, being creative.
p252
aVBut it's not about the technology.
p253
aVIt's just about, I want to create some great experiences.
p254
aVSo thank you very much.
