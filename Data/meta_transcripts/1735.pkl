VIn this talk today, I want to present a different idea
p4
aVfor why investing in early childhood education
p5
aVmakes sense as a public investment.
p6
aVIt's a different idea, because usually,
p7
aVwhen people talk about early childhood programs,
p8
aVthey talk about all the wonderful benefits for participants
p9
aVin terms of former participants, in preschool,
p10
aVthey have better K-12 test scores,
p11
aVbetter adult earnings.
p12
aVNow that's all very important,
p13
aVbut what I want to talk about is what preschool does
p14
aVfor state economies
p15
aVand for promoting state economic development.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd that's actually crucial
p18
aVbecause if we're going to get increased investment
p19
aVin early childhood programs,
p20
aVwe need to interest state governments in this.
p21
aVThe federal government has a lot on its plate,
p22
aVand state governments are going to have to step up.
p23
aVSo we have to appeal to them,
p24
aVthe legislators in the state government,
p25
aVand turn to something they understand,
p26
aVthat they have to promote the economic development
p27
aVof their state economy.
p28
aVNow, by promoting economic development,
p29
aVI don't mean anything magical.
p30
aVAll I mean is, is that early childhood education
p31
aVcan bring more and better jobs to a state
p32
aVand can thereby promote higher per capita earnings
p33
aVfor the state's residents.
p34
aa(lp35
VNow, I think it's fair to say that when people think about
p36
aVstate and local economic development,
p37
aVthey don't generally think first about what they're doing
p38
aVabout childcare and early childhood programs.
p39
aVI know this. I've spent most of my career researching these programs.
p40
aVI've talked to a lot of directors
p41
aVof state economic development agencies about these issues,
p42
aVa lot of legislators about these issues.
p43
aVWhen legislators and others think about economic development,
p44
aVwhat they first of all think about are business tax incentives,
p45
aVproperty tax abatements, job creation tax credits,
p46
aVyou know, there are a million of these programs all over the place.
p47
aVSo for example, states compete very vigorously
p48
aVto attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants.
p49
aVThey hand out all kinds of business tax breaks.
p50
aVNow, those programs can make sense
p51
aVif they in fact induce new location decisions,
p52
aVand the way they can make sense is,
p53
aVby creating more and better jobs,
p54
aVthey raise employment rates, raise per capita earnings of state residents.
p55
aVSo there is a benefit to state residents
p56
aVthat corresponds to the costs that they're paying
p57
aVby paying for these business tax breaks.
p58
aa(lp59
VMy argument is essentially that early childhood programs
p60
aVcan do exactly the same thing,
p61
aVcreate more and better jobs, but in a different way.
p62
aVIt's a somewhat more indirect way.
p63
aVThese programs can promote more and better jobs by,
p64
aVyou build it, you invest in high-quality preschool,
p65
aVit develops the skills of your local workforce
p66
aVif enough of them stick around, and, in turn,
p67
aVthat higher-quality local workforce
p68
aVwill be a key driver of creating jobs and creating
p69
aVhigher earnings per capita in the local community.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow, let me turn to some numbers on this.
p72
aVOkay. If you look at the research evidence \u2014
p73
aVthat's extensive \u2014 on how much early childhood programs
p74
aVaffect the educational attainment, wages and skills
p75
aVof former participants in preschool as adults,
p76
aVyou take those known effects,
p77
aVyou take how many of those folks will be expected
p78
aVto stick around the state or local economy and not move out,
p79
aVand you take research on how much skills
p80
aVdrive job creation, you will conclude,
p81
aVfrom these three separate lines of research,
p82
aVthat for every dollar invested in early childhood programs,
p83
aVthe per capita earnings of state residents
p84
aVgo up by two dollars and 78 cents,
p85
aVso that's a three-to-one return.
p86
aVNow you can get much higher returns,
p87
aVof up to 16-to-one, if you include anti-crime benefits,
p88
aVif you include benefits to former preschool participants
p89
aVwho move to some other state,
p90
aVbut there's a good reason for focusing on these three dollars
p91
aVbecause this is salient and important
p92
aVto state legislators and state policy makers,
p93
aVand it's the states that are going to have to act.
p94
aVSo there is this key benefit that is relevant
p95
aVto state policy makers in terms of economic development.
p96
aa(lp97
VNow, one objection you often hear,
p98
aVor maybe you don't hear it because people are too polite to say it, is,
p99
aVwhy should I pay more taxes
p100
aVto invest in other people's children?
p101
aVWhat's in it for me?
p102
aVAnd the trouble with that objection,
p103
aVit reflects a total misunderstanding
p104
aVof how much local economies
p105
aVinvolve everyone being interdependent.
p106
aVSpecifically, the interdependency here is, is that
p107
aVthere are huge spillovers of skills \u2014
p108
aVthat when other people's children get more skills,
p109
aVthat actually increases the prosperity of everyone,
p110
aVincluding people whose skills don't change.
p111
aVSo for example, numerous research studies have shown
p112
aVif you look at what really drives
p113
aVthe growth rate of metropolitan areas,
p114
aVit's not so much low taxes, low cost, low wages;
p115
aVit's the skills of the area. Particularly, the proxy for skills
p116
aVthat people use is percentage of college graduates in the area.
p117
aVSo when you look, for example, at metropolitan areas
p118
aVsuch as the Boston area, Minneapolis-St. Paul,
p119
aVSilicon Valley, these areas are not doing well economically
p120
aVbecause they're low-cost.
p121
aVI don't know if you ever tried to buy a house in Silicon Valley.
p122
aVIt's not exactly a low-cost proposition.
p123
aVThey are growing because they have high levels of skills.
p124
aVSo when we invest in other people's children,
p125
aVand build up those skills, we increase the overall job growth
p126
aVof a metro area.
p127
aVAs another example, if we look
p128
aVat what determines an individual's wages,
p129
aVand we do statistical exploration of that, what determines wages,
p130
aVwe know that the individual's wages will depend, in part,
p131
aVon that individual's education,
p132
aVfor example whether or not they have a college degree.
p133
aVOne of the very interesting facts is that, in addition,
p134
aVwe find that even once we hold constant, statistically,
p135
aVthe effect of your own education,
p136
aVthe education of everyone else in your metropolitan area
p137
aValso affects your wages.
p138
aVSo specifically, if you hold constant your education,
p139
aVyou stick in percentage of college graduates in your metro area,
p140
aVyou will find that has a significant positive effect on your wages
p141
aVwithout changing your education at all.
p142
aVIn fact, this effect is so strong
p143
aVthat when someone gets a college degree,
p144
aVthe spillover effects of this on the wages
p145
aVof others in the metropolitan area
p146
aVare actually greater than the direct effects.
p147
aVSo if someone gets a college degree, their lifetime earnings
p148
aVgo up by a huge amount, over 700,000 dollars.
p149
aVThere's an effect on everyone else in the metro area
p150
aVof driving up the percentage of college graduates in the metro area,
p151
aVand if you add that up \u2014 it's a small effect for each person,
p152
aVbut if you add that up across all the people in the metro area,
p153
aVyou actually get that the increase in wages for everyone else
p154
aVin the metropolitan area adds up to almost a million dollars.
p155
aVThat's actually greater than the direct benefits
p156
aVof the person choosing to get education.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow, what's going on here?
p159
aVWhat can explain these huge spillover effects of education?
p160
aVWell, let's think about it this way.
p161
aVI can be the most skilled person in the world,
p162
aVbut if everyone else at my firm lacks skills,
p163
aVmy employer is going to find it more difficult
p164
aVto introduce new technology, new production techniques.
p165
aVSo as a result, my employer is going to be less productive.
p166
aVThey will not be able to afford to pay me as good wages.
p167
aVEven if everyone at my firm has good skills,
p168
aVif the workers at the suppliers to my firm
p169
aVdo not have good skills,
p170
aVmy firm is going to be less competitive
p171
aVcompeting in national and international markets.
p172
aVAnd again, the firm that's less competitive
p173
aVwill not be able to pay as good wages,
p174
aVand then, particularly in high-tech businesses,
p175
aVthey're constantly stealing ideas and workers from other businesses.
p176
aVSo clearly the productivity of firms in Silicon Valley
p177
aVhas a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at their firm,
p178
aVbut the workers at all the other firms in the metro area.
p179
aVSo as a result, if we can invest in other people's children
p180
aVthrough preschool and other early childhood programs
p181
aVthat are high-quality, we not only help those children,
p182
aVwe help everyone in the metropolitan area
p183
aVgain in wages and we'll have the metropolitan area
p184
aVgain in job growth.
p185
aa(lp186
VAnother objection used sometimes here
p187
aVto invest in early childhood programs
p188
aVis concern about people moving out.
p189
aVSo, you know, maybe Ohio's thinking about investing
p190
aVin more preschool education
p191
aVfor children in Columbus, Ohio,
p192
aVbut they're worried that these little Buckeyes will,
p193
aVfor some strange reason, decide to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan,
p194
aVand become Wolverines.
p195
aVAnd maybe Michigan will be thinking about investing
p196
aVin preschool in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and be worried
p197
aVthese little Wolverines will end up moving to Ohio and becoming Buckeyes.
p198
aVAnd so they'll both underinvest because everyone's going to move out.
p199
aVWell, the reality is, if you look at the data,
p200
aVAmericans aren't as hyper-mobile as people sometimes assume.
p201
aVThe data is that over 60 percent of Americans
p202
aVspend most of their working careers
p203
aVin the state they were born in, over 60 percent.
p204
aVThat percentage does not vary much from state to state.
p205
aVIt doesn't vary much with the state's economy,
p206
aVwhether it's depressed or booming,
p207
aVit doesn't vary much over time.
p208
aVSo the reality is, if you invest in kids,
p209
aVthey will stay.
p210
aVOr at least, enough of them will stay
p211
aVthat it will pay off for your state economy.
p212
aa(lp213
VOkay, so to sum up, there is a lot of research evidence
p214
aVthat early childhood programs, if run in a high-quality way,
p215
aVpay off in higher adult skills.
p216
aVThere's a lot of research evidence
p217
aVthat those folks will stick around the state economy,
p218
aVand there's a lot of evidence that having more workers
p219
aVwith higher skills in your local economy
p220
aVpays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy,
p221
aVand if you calculate the numbers for each dollar,
p222
aVwe get about three dollars back
p223
aVin benefits for the state economy.
p224
aVSo in my opinion, the research evidence is compelling
p225
aVand the logic of this is compelling.
p226
aVSo what are the barriers to getting it done?
p227
aa(lp228
VWell, one obvious barrier is cost.
p229
aVSo if you look at what it would cost
p230
aVif every state government invested
p231
aVin universal preschool at age four, full-day preschool at age four,
p232
aVthe total annual national cost would be roughly
p233
aV30 billion dollars.
p234
aVSo, 30 billion dollars is a lot of money.
p235
aVOn the other hand, if you reflect on
p236
aVthat the U.S.'s population is over 300 million,
p237
aVwe're talking about an amount of money
p238
aVthat amounts to 100 dollars per capita.
p239
aVOkay? A hundred dollars per capita, per person,
p240
aVis something that any state government can afford to do.
p241
aVIt's just a simple matter of political will to do it.
p242
aVAnd, of course, as I mentioned,
p243
aVthis cost has corresponding benefits.
p244
aVI mentioned there's a multiplier of about three,
p245
aV2.78, for the state economy,
p246
aVin terms of over 80 billion in extra earnings.
p247
aVAnd if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars
p248
aVto something that might mean something,
p249
aVwhat we're talking about is that, for the average low-income kid,
p250
aVthat would increase earnings by about 10 percent
p251
aVover their whole career, just doing the preschool,
p252
aVnot improving K-12 or anything else after that,
p253
aVnot doing anything with college tuition or access,
p254
aVjust directly improving preschool,
p255
aVand we would get five percent higher earnings
p256
aVfor middle-class kids.
p257
aVSo this is an investment
p258
aVthat pays off in very concrete terms
p259
aVfor a broad range of income groups in the state's population
p260
aVand produces large and tangible benefits.
p261
aa(lp262
VNow, that's one barrier.
p263
aVI actually think the more profound barrier
p264
aVis the long-term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs.
p265
aVSo the argument I'm making is, is that we're increasing
p266
aVthe quality of our local workforce,
p267
aVand thereby increasing economic development.
p268
aVObviously if we have a preschool with four-year-olds,
p269
aVwe're not sending these kids out at age five
p270
aVto work in the sweatshops, right? At least I hope not.
p271
aVSo we're talking about an investment
p272
aVthat in terms of impacts on the state economy
p273
aVis not going to really pay off for 15 or 20 years,
p274
aVand of course America is notorious for being
p275
aVa short term-oriented society.
p276
aVNow one response you can make to this,
p277
aVand I sometimes have done this in talks,
p278
aVis people can talk about, there are benefits for these programs
p279
aVin reducing special ed and remedial education costs,
p280
aVthere are benefits, parents care about preschool,
p281
aVmaybe we'll get some migration effects
p282
aVfrom parents seeking good preschool,
p283
aVand I think those are true,
p284
aVbut in some sense they're missing the point.
p285
aa(lp286
VUltimately, this is something
p287
aVwe're investing in now for the future.
p288
aVAnd so what I want to leave you with is
p289
aVwhat I think is the ultimate question.
p290
aVI mean, I'm an economist, but this is ultimately
p291
aVnot an economic question, it's a moral question:
p292
aVAre we willing, as Americans,
p293
aVare we as a society still capable
p294
aVof making the political choice to sacrifice now
p295
aVby paying more taxes
p296
aVin order to improve the long-term future
p297
aVof not only our kids, but our community?
p298
aVAre we still capable of that as a country?
p299
aVAnd that's something that each and every citizen
p300
aVand voter needs to ask themselves.
p301
aVIs that something that you are still invested in,
p302
aVthat you still believe in the notion of investment?
p303
aVThat is the notion of investment.
p304
aVYou sacrifice now for a return later.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo I think the research evidence
p307
aVon the benefits of early childhood programs
p308
aVfor the local economy is extremely strong.
p309
aVHowever, the moral and political choice
p310
aVis still up to us, as citizens and as voters.
