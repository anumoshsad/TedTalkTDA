VSo 24 years ago,
p4
aVI was brought to The New Yorker
p5
aVas art editor
p6
aVto rejuvenate
p7
aVwhat had by then become a somewhat staid institution
p8
aVand to bring in new artists
p9
aVand to try to bring the magazine from its ivory tower
p10
aVinto engaging with its time.
p11
aVAnd it was just the right thing for me to do
p12
aVbecause I've always been captivated by how an image can \u2014
p13
aVa simple drawing \u2014
p14
aVcan cut through the torrent of images that we see every single day.
p15
aVHow it can capture a moment,
p16
aVhow it can crystallize a social trend or a complex event
p17
aVin a way that a lot of words wouldn't be able to do \u2014
p18
aVand reduce it to its essence and turn it into a cartoon.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo I went to the library
p21
aVand I looked at the first cover drawn by Rea Irvin in 1925 \u2014
p22
aVa dandy looking at a butterfly through his monocle,
p23
aVand we call it Eustace Tilley.
p24
aVAnd I realized that as the magazine had become known
p25
aVfor its in-depth research and long reports,
p26
aVsome of the humor had gotten lost along the way,
p27
aVbecause now often Eustace Tilley was seen as a haughty dandy,
p28
aVbut in fact, in 1925,
p29
aVwhen Rea Irvin first drew this image,
p30
aVhe did it as part of a humor magazine
p31
aVto amuse the youth of the era,
p32
aVwhich was the flappers of the roaring twenties.
p33
aVAnd in the library,
p34
aVI found the images that really captured the zeitgeist
p35
aVof the Great Depression.
p36
aVAnd it showed us not just how people dressed
p37
aVor what their cars looked like,
p38
aVbut also what made them laugh,
p39
aVwhat their prejudices were.
p40
aVAnd you really got a sense
p41
aVof what it felt like to be alive in the '30s.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo I called on contemporary artists,
p44
aVsuch as Adrian Tomine here.
p45
aVI often call on narrative artists \u2014
p46
aVcartoonists, children's book authors \u2014
p47
aVand I give them themes such as,
p48
aVyou know, what it's like to be in the subway,
p49
aVor Valentine's Day,
p50
aVand they send me sketches.
p51
aVAnd once the sketches are approved by the editor,
p52
aVDavid Remnick,
p53
aVit's a go.
p54
aVAnd I love the way
p55
aVthose images are actually not telling you what to think.
p56
aVBut they do make you think,
p57
aVbecause the artist is actually \u2014
p58
aVit's almost a puzzle;
p59
aVthe artist is drawing the dots,
p60
aVand you, the reader, have to complete the picture.
p61
aVSo to get this image on the left by Anita Kunz,
p62
aVor the one on right by Tomer Hanuka,
p63
aVyou have to play spot the differences.
p64
aVAnd it is something that ...
p65
aVIt's really exciting to see
p66
aVhow the engagement with the reader ...
p67
aVhow those images really capture \u2014
p68
aVplay with the stereotypes.
p69
aVBut when you get it,
p70
aVit rearranges the stereotypes that are in your head.
p71
aa(lp72
VBut the images don't just have to show people,
p73
aVsometimes it can be a feeling.
p74
aVRight after September 11,
p75
aVI was at a point,
p76
aVlike everybody else,
p77
aVwhere I really didn't know how to deal with what we were going through,
p78
aVand I felt that no image could capture this moment,
p79
aVand I wanted to just do a black cover,
p80
aVlike no cover.
p81
aVAnd I talked to my husband, cartoonist Art Spiegelman,
p82
aVand mentioned to him that I was going to propose that,
p83
aVand he said, "Oh, if you're going to do a black cover,
p84
aVthen why don't you do the silhouette of the Twin Towers,
p85
aVblack on black?"
p86
aVAnd I sat down to draw this,
p87
aVand as soon as I saw it,
p88
aVa shiver ran down my spine
p89
aVand I realized
p90
aVthat in this refusal to make an image,
p91
aVwe had found a way to capture loss
p92
aVand mourning
p93
aVand absence.
p94
aVAnd it's been a profound thing that I learned in the process \u2014
p95
aVthat sometimes some of the images that say the most
p96
aVdo it with the most spare means.
p97
aVAnd a simple image can speak volumes.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo this is the image that we published by Bob Staake
p100
aVright after the election of Barack Obama,
p101
aVand captured a historic moment.
p102
aVBut we can't really plan for this,
p103
aVbecause in order to do this,
p104
aVwe have to let the artist experience the emotions that we all feel
p105
aVwhen that is happening.
p106
aVSo back in November 2016,
p107
aVduring the election last year,
p108
aVthe only image that we could publish was this,
p109
aVwhich was on the stand on the week that everybody voted.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VBecause we knew somebody would feel this \u2014
p114
aa(lp115
V(Laughter)
p116
aa(lp117
Vwhen the result of the election was announced.
p118
aVAnd when we found out the result,
p119
aVwe really were at a loss,
p120
aVand this is the image that was sent by Bob Staake again,
p121
aVand that really hit a chord.
p122
aVAnd again,
p123
aVwe can't really figure out what's going to come next,
p124
aVbut here it felt like we didn't know how to move forward,
p125
aVbut we did move forward,
p126
aVand this is the image that we published after Donald Trump's election
p127
aVand at the time of the Women's March
p128
aVall over the US.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo over those 24 years,
p131
aVI have seen over 1,000 images come to life week after week,
p132
aVand I'm often asked which one is my favorite,
p133
aVbut I can't pick one
p134
aVbecause what I'm most proud of is how different every image is,
p135
aVone from the other.
p136
aVAnd that's due to the talent and the diversity
p137
aVof all of the artists that contribute.
p138
aa(lp139
VAnd now, well,
p140
aVnow, we're owned by Russia,
p141
aVso \u2014
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VIn a rendering by Barry Blitt here,
p146
aVEustace has become Eustace Vladimirovich Tilley.
p147
aVAnd the butterfly is none other than a flabbergasted Donald Trump
p148
aVflapping his wings,
p149
aVtrying to figure out how to control the butterfly effect,
p150
aVand the famed logo that was drawn by Rae Irvin in 1925
p151
aVis now in Cyrillic.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo, what makes me really excited about this moment
p154
aVis the way that ...
p155
aVYou know, free press is essential to our democracy.
p156
aVAnd we can see from the sublime to the ridiculous
p157
aVthat artists can capture what is going on
p158
aVin a way that an artist
p159
aVarmed with just India ink and watercolor
p160
aVcan capture and enter into the cultural dialogue.
p161
aVIt puts those artists at the center of that culture,
p162
aVand that's exactly where I think they should be.
p163
aVBecause the main thing we need right now is a good cartoon.
p164
aa(lp165
VThank you.
