VYou know, there's a small country nestled in the Himalayan Mountains,
p4
aVfar from these beautiful mountains, where the people
p5
aVof the Kingdom of Bhutan have decided to do something different,
p6
aVwhich is to measure their gross national happiness
p7
aVrather than their gross national product.
p8
aVAnd why not?
p9
aVAfter all, happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few,
p10
aVbut a fundamental human right for all.
p11
aVAnd what is happiness?
p12
aVHappiness is the freedom of choice.
p13
aVThe freedom to chose where to live,
p14
aVwhat to do, what to buy, what to sell,
p15
aVfrom whom, to whom, when and how.
p16
aVWhere does choice come from?
p17
aVAnd who gets to express it, and how do we express it?
p18
aa(lp19
VWell, one way to express choice is through the market.
p20
aVWell-functioning markets provide choices, and ultimately,
p21
aVthe ability to express one's pursuit for happiness.
p22
aVThe great Indian economist, Amartya Sen, was awarded the Nobel prize
p23
aVfor demonstrating that famine is not so much about
p24
aVthe availability of food supply, but rather the ability to acquire
p25
aVor entitle oneself to that food through the market.
p26
aVIn 1984, in what can only be considered one of the
p27
aVgreatest crimes of humanity, nearly one million people died of starvation
p28
aVin my country of birth, Ethiopia.
p29
aVNot because there was not enough food \u2014
p30
aVbecause there was actually a surplus of food
p31
aVin the fertile regions of the south parts of the country \u2014
p32
aVbut because in the north, people could not access
p33
aVor entitle themselves to that food.
p34
aVThat was a turning point for my life.
p35
aa(lp36
VMost Africans today, by far, are farmers.
p37
aVAnd most of Africa's farmers are, by and large,
p38
aVsmall farmers in terms of land that they operate, and very, very small
p39
aVfarmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal.
p40
aVAfrican agriculture today is among, or is, the most under-capitalized in the world.
p41
aVOnly seven percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated,
p42
aVcompared to 40 percent in Asia.
p43
aVAfrican farmers only use some 22 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare,
p44
aVcompared to 144 in Asia.
p45
aVRoad density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa.
p46
aVThere are eight times more tractors in Latin America,
p47
aVand three times more tractors in Asia, than in Africa.
p48
aVThe small farmer in Africa today lives a life without much choice,
p49
aVand therefore without much freedom.
p50
aVHis livelihood is predetermined
p51
aVby the conditions of grinding poverty.
p52
aVHe comes to the market when prices are lowest,
p53
aVwith the meager fruits of his hard labor, just after the harvest,
p54
aVbecause he has no choice.
p55
aVShe comes back to the market
p56
aVsome months later, when prices are highest, in what we call
p57
aVthe lean season \u2014 when food is scarce \u2014
p58
aVbecause she has to feed her family and has no choice.
p59
aa(lp60
VThe real question is, how can markets be developed in rural Africa
p61
aVto harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship
p62
aVthat we know exists?
p63
aVAnother notable economist, Theodore Schultz,
p64
aVin 1974 won the Nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers
p65
aVare efficient, but poor.
p66
aVMeaning, in fact, that farmers are rational
p67
aVand profit-minded just like everybody else.
p68
aVWell, we don't need, now,
p69
aVany more Nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake
p70
aVat the market and want to make money, just like everyone else.
p71
aVAnd one thing is clear, which is at least now we know
p72
aVthat Africa is open for business.
p73
aVAnd that business is agriculture.
p74
aVOver two decades ago, the world insisted to Africa that markets
p75
aVmust be liberalized, that economies must be structurally adjusted.
p76
aVThis meant that governments were to remove themselves
p77
aVfrom the business of buying and selling \u2014
p78
aVwhich they did rather inefficiently \u2014
p79
aVand let the private market do its magic.
p80
aVWell, what happened over the last 25 years?
p81
aVDid Africa feed itself?
p82
aVDid our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors?
p83
aa(lp84
VI think we're all in this room,
p85
aVprobably, because we know that, in fact, Africa is the only region
p86
aVin the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up
p87
aVover the next 10 years,
p88
aVwhere the food import bill is now double
p89
aVwhat it was 20 years ago,
p90
aVwhere food production per capita has
p91
aVstagnated, and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased.
p92
aVSo why didn't agriculture markets perform to expectations?
p93
aVThe market reforms prompted by the West \u2014
p94
aVand I've spent some 15 years traveling around the continent
p95
aVdoing research on agricultural markets, and have interviewed
p96
aVtraders in 10 to 15 countries in this continent, hundreds of traders \u2014
p97
aVtrying to understand what went wrong with our market reform.
p98
aVAnd it seems to me that the reforms might have
p99
aVthrown the baby out with the bath water.
p100
aa(lp101
VLike its agriculture,
p102
aVAfrica's markets are highly under-capitalized and inefficient.
p103
aVWe know from our work around the continent
p104
aVthat transaction costs of reaching the market,
p105
aVand the risks of transacting in rural, agriculture markets,
p106
aVare extremely high.
p107
aVIn fact, only one third of agricultural output
p108
aVproduced in Africa even reaches the market.
p109
aVAfrica's markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure
p110
aVin terms of roads and telecommunications, but also because
p111
aVof the virtual absence of necessary market institutions, such as
p112
aVmarket information, grades and standards,
p113
aVand reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers.
p114
aVBecause of this, commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles,
p115
aVin narrow networks of people they know and trust.
p116
aVAnd because of that, as grain changes hands \u2014
p117
aVand I've measured that it changes hands four, five times in
p118
aVits trajectory from the farmer to the consumer \u2014
p119
aVevery time it changes hands \u2014 and I've seen this all over rural Africa \u2014
p120
aVit also changes sacks.
p121
aa(lp122
VAnd I thought that was incredibly peculiar.
p123
aVAnd really realized that that was because \u2014 as traders would tell me
p124
aVover and over \u2014 that's the only way people know what they're getting
p125
aVin terms of the quantity and the product quality.
p126
aVAnd that actually has huge implications
p127
aVfor the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals,
p128
aVand situations where there are deficits, for example.
p129
aVIt also has very high cost implications.
p130
aVI have measured that 26 percent of the marketing margin
p131
aVis simply due to the fact that, because of the absence
p132
aVof grades and standards and market information,
p133
aVsacks have to be constantly changed.
p134
aVAnd this leads to very high handling costs.
p135
aVFor their part, small farmers, who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in Africa,
p136
aVcome to the market with virtually no information at all \u2014 blind \u2014
p137
aVtrusting that they're going to have
p138
aVsome sort of demand for their produce,
p139
aVand completely at the mercy of the merchants
p140
aVin the only market, the nearest local market they know \u2014
p141
aVwhere they're unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk.
p142
aa(lp143
VSpeaking of risk, we have seen that price volatility
p144
aVof food crops in Africa is the highest in the world.
p145
aVIn Africa, small farmers bear the brunt of this risk.
p146
aVIn fact, in my view, there is no region of the world and no period in history
p147
aVthat farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk
p148
aVthat Africa's farmers have to bear.
p149
aVAnd in my view, there is simply no place in the world
p150
aVthat has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk
p151
aVthat our farmers in Africa today face.
p152
aVIn Ethiopia, for example, the variation in maize prices
p153
aVfrom year to year is as much as 50 percent annually.
p154
aVThis kind of market risk is mind-boggling, and has direct implications
p155
aVfor not only the incentives of farmers to invest
p156
aVin higher productivity technology, such as modern seeds and fertilizers,
p157
aVbut also direct implications for food security.
p158
aa(lp159
VTo give you an example, between 2001 and 2002,
p160
aVEthiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest.
p161
aVThat in turn, because of the weak marketing system,
p162
aVled to an 80 percent collapse in maize prices in the country.
p163
aVThis made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields.
p164
aVAnd we calculated that some 300,000 tons of grain
p165
aVwas left in the fields to rot in early 2002.
p166
aVNot six months later, in July 2002, Ethiopia announced a major food crisis,
p167
aVto the same proportions as 1984: 14 million people at risk of starvation.
p168
aVWhat also happened that year
p169
aVis in the areas where there were good rains, and where farmers
p170
aVhad previously produced surplus grain, farmers had decided
p171
aVto withdraw from the fertilizer market, not use fertilizer
p172
aVand actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by 27 percent.
p173
aVThis is a tragic example of arrested development,
p174
aVor a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks.
p175
aVAnd this is not just specific to Ethiopia,
p176
aVbut happens over and over, all over Africa.
p177
aa(lp178
VWell, I'm not here today to lament about the situation, or wring my hands.
p179
aVI am here to tell you that change is in the air.
p180
aVAfrica today is not the Africa waiting for aid solutions,
p181
aVor cookie-cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions.
p182
aVAfrica has learned, or is learning somewhat slowly,
p183
aVthat markets don't happen by themselves.
p184
aVIn the 1980s, it was very fashionable
p185
aVto talk about getting prices right.
p186
aVThere was a very influential book about that,
p187
aVwhich was mainly about getting governments out of the market.
p188
aVWe now recognize that getting markets right is about not just
p189
aVprice incentives, but also investing in the right infrastructure
p190
aVand the appropriate and necessary institutions to create
p191
aVthe conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market.
p192
aVWhen conditions are right, we know and see
p193
aVthat that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa,
p194
aVjust like anywhere else.
p195
aa(lp196
VNearly three years ago, I decided to leave my comfortable job
p197
aVas a World Bank senior economist in Washington
p198
aVand come back to my country of birth, Ethiopia,
p199
aVafter nearly 30 years abroad.
p200
aVI did so for a simple reason.
p201
aVAfter having spent more than a decade
p202
aVunderstanding, studying, and trying to convince policymakers and donors
p203
aVabout what was wrong with Africa's agricultural markets,
p204
aVI decided it was time to do something about it.
p205
aVI currently lead, in Ethiopia, an exciting new initiative
p206
aVto establish the first Ethiopia Commodity Exchange, or ECX.
p207
aVNow, the commodity exchange itself, that concept,
p208
aVis not new to the world.
p209
aVIn fact, in 1848, 82 grain merchants and farmers got together
p210
aVin a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan
p211
aVto establish a way to trade better amongst themselves.
p212
aa(lp213
VThat was, of course, the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade,
p214
aVwhich is the most famous commodity exchange in the world.
p215
aVThe Chicago Board of Trade was established then
p216
aVfor precisely the same reasons
p217
aVthat our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange.
p218
aVIn the American Midwest, farmers used to load grain onto barges
p219
aVand send it upriver to the Chicago market.
p220
aVBut once it arrived, if no buyer was to be found,
p221
aVor if prices suddenly dropped, farmers would incur tremendous losses.
p222
aVAnd in fact, would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan,
p223
aVrather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms.
p224
aVWell, the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses
p225
aVled to the birth of the futures market, and the underlying system
p226
aVof grading grain and receipting \u2014 issuing warehouse receipts
p227
aVon the basis of which trade could be done.
p228
aa(lp229
VFrom there, the greatest innovation of all came about in this market,
p230
aVwhich is that buyers and sellers could transact grain
p231
aVwithout actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain.
p232
aVThat meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances,
p233
aVand even across time \u2014 as far forward as 18 months into the future.
p234
aVThis innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture,
p235
aVand the rise of Chicago to a global market,
p236
aVagricultural market, superpower from where it was, a small regional town.
p237
aVNow, over the last century,
p238
aVwe tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purview
p239
aVof Western industrialized countries,
p240
aVand that the reference prices for cotton, coffee, cocoa \u2014
p241
aVproducts produced mainly in the south \u2014
p242
aVare actually a reference price, or a price discovered in these
p243
aVorganized commodity exchanges in the northern countries.
p244
aVBut that is actually changing.
p245
aa(lp246
VAnd we're seeing a shift \u2014
p247
aVpowered mainly because of information technology \u2014
p248
aVa shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets.
p249
aVAnd over the last decade, you see that the share of Western exchanges \u2014
p250
aVand this is the U.S. share of exchanges in the world \u2014
p251
aVhas gone down by nearly half in just the last decade.
p252
aVSimilarly, there's been explosive growth in India, for example,
p253
aVwhere rural farmers are using exchanges \u2014 growing here
p254
aVover the last three years by 270 percent a year.
p255
aVThis is powered by low-cost VSAT technology,
p256
aVaggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market.
p257
aVChina's Dalian Commodity Exchange, three years ago,
p258
aV2004, overtook the Chicago Board of Trade to become
p259
aVthe second largest commodity exchange in the world.
p260
aVNow, in Ethiopia, we're in the process of designing
p261
aVthe first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange.
p262
aVWe're not trying to cut and paste the Chicago model
p263
aVor the India model, but creating a system uniquely tailored
p264
aVto Ethiopia's needs and realities,
p265
aVEthiopia's small farmers.
p266
aa(lp267
VSo, the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia.
p268
aVWe're creating a system that serves all market actors,
p269
aVthat creates integrity, trust, efficiency, transparency
p270
aVand enables small farmers to manage the risks that I have described.
p271
aVIn the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia,
p272
aVwe've done something rather unique, which is to
p273
aVtake the approach of an integrated perspective,
p274
aVor what we call the ECX Edge.
p275
aVThe ECX Edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem
p276
aVin which the market will develop itself.
p277
aVAnd this is because one of the things we've learned
p278
aVover the last decade of studying market development in Africa
p279
aVis that the piecemeal approach does not work.
p280
aVYou've got one donor trying to develop market information,
p281
aVanother trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards,
p282
aVanother ICT, and yet another on warehousing, or warehouse receipts.
p283
aa(lp284
VIn our approach in Ethiopia,
p285
aVwe've decided to put together the entire ecosystem,
p286
aVor environment, in which trade takes place.
p287
aVThat means that the exchange will operate a trading system,
p288
aVwhich will initially start as an open outcry,
p289
aVbecause we don't think the country's ready for full electronic trading.
p290
aVBut at the same time, we'll do something which I think no exchange
p291
aVin the world has ever done, which is itself to operate something like
p292
aVan Internet cafe in the rural areas.
p293
aVSo that farmers and small traders
p294
aVcan actually come to a terminal center \u2014 what we call
p295
aVthe remote access terminal centers \u2014 and actually,
p296
aVwithout having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up
p297
aVor any of those things, simply see the trading
p298
aVthat's happening on the Addis Ababa trading floor.
p299
aa(lp300
VAt the same time, what's very fundamental to this market is that \u2014
p301
aVand again, an innovation that we've designed for our exchange \u2014
p302
aVis that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country,
p303
aVin which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done.
p304
aVAnd in turn, we'll operate an in-house clearing system,
p305
aVto assure that payment is done appropriately,
p306
aVin the right amount and at the right time,
p307
aVso that basically, we create trust and integrity in the system.
p308
aVObviously, we work with exchange actors,
p309
aVand as we're developing the exchange market itself,
p310
aVwe're also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework,
p311
aVthe overarching legal framework for making this market work.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo, in fact, our proclamation
p314
aVis going to parliament next month.
p315
aVWhat's really important is that the ECX will operate a market information system
p316
aVto disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country,
p317
aVusing VSAT technology to bring an electronic price dissemination
p318
aVdirectly to farmers.
p319
aVWhat this does is transforms, fundamentally,
p320
aVthe farmers' relationship to the market.
p321
aVWhereas before the farmer used to think local \u2014
p322
aVmeaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market,
p323
aVeight to 10 kilometers away on average,
p324
aVand sell whatever they happened to have,
p325
aVwithout any idea of what the price premium or anything else was \u2014
p326
aVnow farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market.
p327
aVAnd they start to think national, and even global.
p328
aVThey start to make not only commercial marketing decisions,
p329
aVbut also planting decisions, on the basis of information
p330
aVcoming from the futures price market.
p331
aVAnd they come to the market knowing what grades their products
p332
aVwill achieve in terms of a price premium.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo all of this will transform farmers.
p335
aVIt will also transform the way traders do business.
p336
aVIt will stop them from doing simple, back-to-back, limited arbitrage
p337
aVto really thinking strategically about how to move grain
p338
aVacross long distances from [surplus regions] to [deficit areas].
p339
aVCan Ethiopia do this?
p340
aVIt seems very ambitious.
p341
aVBut it will create new opportunities.
p342
aVWe believe that this initiative requires great political will,
p343
aVand we'll have to align the financial sector, as well as the ICT sector,
p344
aVand really even the underlying legal framework.
p345
aVWe believe that the winds of change are here, and that we can do it.
p346
aVECX is the market for Ethiopia's new millennium,
p347
aVwhich starts in about eight months.
p348
aa(lp349
VThe last parliament of our century opened with our president
p350
aVannouncing to the country that this was the most important
p351
aVeconomic initiative for the country today.
p352
aVWe believe that the stakes are high,
p353
aVbut that the returns will be even greater.
p354
aVECX, moreover, can become a trading platform for a pan-African market
p355
aVin agricultural commodities.
p356
aVEthiopia's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value.
p357
aVAnd we feel that over the next five years,
p358
aVif Ethiopia can capture even 40 percent, just 40 percent, of the domestic market,
p359
aVand add just 25 percent value to that market, the value of the market doubles.
p360
aVEthiopia's agricultural market is 30 percent higher
p361
aVthan South Africa's grain production,
p362
aVand, in fact, Ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in Africa.
p363
aVSo the potential is there.
p364
aVThe will is there.
p365
aVThe commitment is there.
p366
aVSo we feel that we have a winning value proposition
p367
aVto transform farmers' choices, to grow our agriculture,
p368
aVand to change Africa.
p369
aVSo, we are in the business of finding our happiness.
p370
aVThank you very much.
