VIs there life beyond Earth in our solar system?
p4
aa(lp5
VWow, what a powerful question.
p6
aVYou know, as a scientist \u2014
p7
aVplanetary scientist \u2014
p8
aVwe really didn't take that very seriously until recently.
p9
aa(lp10
VCarl Sagan always said,
p11
aV"It takes extraordinary evidence for extraordinary claims."
p12
aVAnd the claims of having life beyond Earth
p13
aVneed to be definitive,
p14
aVthey need to be loud
p15
aVand they need to be everywhere for us to be able to believe it.
p16
aa(lp17
VSo how do we make this journey?
p18
aVWhat we decided to do
p19
aVis first look for those ingredients for life.
p20
aVThe ingredients of life are:
p21
aVliquid water \u2014
p22
aVwe have to have a solvent,
p23
aVcan't be ice, has to be liquid.
p24
aVWe also have to have energy.
p25
aVWe also have to have organic material \u2014
p26
aVthings that make us up,
p27
aVbut also things that we need to consume.
p28
aa(lp29
VSo we have to have these elements
p30
aVin environments for long periods of time
p31
aVfor us to be able to be confident that life,
p32
aVin that moment when it starts,
p33
aVcan spark and then grow and evolve.
p34
aa(lp35
VWell, I have to tell you that early in my career,
p36
aVwhen we looked at those three elements,
p37
aVI didn't believe that they were beyond Earth
p38
aVin any length of time and for any real quantity.
p39
aa(lp40
VWhy? We look at the inner planets.
p41
aVVenus is way too hot \u2014 it's got no water.
p42
aVMars \u2014 dry and arid.
p43
aVIt's got no water.
p44
aVAnd beyond Mars,
p45
aVthe water in the solar system is all frozen.
p46
aa(lp47
VBut recent observations have changed all that.
p48
aVIt's now turning our attention to the right places
p49
aVfor us to take a deeper look
p50
aVand really start to answer our life question.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo when we look out into the solar system,
p53
aVwhere are the possibilities?
p54
aVWe're concentrating our attention on four locations.
p55
aVThe planet Mars
p56
aVand then three moons of the outer planets:
p57
aVTitan, Europa and small Enceladus.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo what about Mars?
p60
aVLet's go through the evidence.
p61
aVWell, Mars we thought was initially moon-like:
p62
aVfull of craters, arid and a dead world.
p63
aa(lp64
VAnd so about 15 years ago,
p65
aVwe started a series of missions to go to Mars
p66
aVand see if water existed on Mars in its past
p67
aVthat changed its geology.
p68
aVWe ought to be able to notice that.
p69
aVAnd indeed we started to be surprised right away.
p70
aVOur higher resolution images show deltas and river valleys and gulleys
p71
aVthat were there in the past.
p72
aVAnd in fact,
p73
aVCuriosity \u2014
p74
aVwhich has been roving on the surface now for about three years \u2014
p75
aVhas really shown us that it's sitting in an ancient river bed,
p76
aVwhere water flowed rapidly.
p77
aVAnd not for a little while,
p78
aVperhaps hundreds of millions of years.
p79
aVAnd if everything was there,
p80
aVincluding organics,
p81
aVperhaps life had started.
p82
aa(lp83
VCuriosity has also drilled in that red soil
p84
aVand brought up other material.
p85
aVAnd we were really excited when we saw that.
p86
aVBecause it wasn't red Mars,
p87
aVit was gray material,
p88
aVit's gray Mars.
p89
aVWe brought it into the rover,
p90
aVwe tasted it,
p91
aVand guess what?
p92
aVWe tasted organics \u2014
p93
aVcarbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
p94
aVnitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur \u2014
p95
aVthey were all there.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo Mars in its past,
p98
aVwith a lot of water,
p99
aVperhaps plenty of time,
p100
aVcould have had life,
p101
aVcould have had that spark,
p102
aVcould have grown.
p103
aVAnd is that life still there?
p104
aVWe don't know that.
p105
aa(lp106
VBut a few years ago
p107
aVwe started to look at a number of craters.
p108
aVDuring the summer,
p109
aVdark lines would appear down the sides of these craters.
p110
aVThe more we looked,
p111
aVthe more craters we saw,
p112
aVthe more of these features.
p113
aVWe now know more than a dozen of them.
p114
aa(lp115
VA few months ago the fairy tale came true.
p116
aVWe announced to the world that we know what these streaks are.
p117
aVIt's liquid water.
p118
aVThese craters are weeping during the summer.
p119
aVLiquid water is flowing down these craters.
p120
aVSo what are we going to do now \u2014
p121
aVnow that we see the water?
p122
aVWell, it tells us that Mars has all the ingredients necessary for life.
p123
aVIn its past it had perhaps two-thirds of its northern hemisphere \u2014
p124
aVthere was an ocean.
p125
aVIt has weeping water right now.
p126
aVLiquid water on its surface.
p127
aVIt has organics.
p128
aVIt has all the right conditions.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo what are we going to do next?
p131
aVWe're going to launch a series of missions
p132
aVto begin that search for life on Mars.
p133
aVAnd now it's more appealing than ever before.
p134
aa(lp135
VAs we move out into the solar system,
p136
aVhere's the tiny moon Enceladus.
p137
aVThis is not in what we call the traditional habitable zone,
p138
aVthis area around the sun.
p139
aVThis is much further out.
p140
aVThis object should be ice over a silicate core.
p141
aa(lp142
VBut what did we find?
p143
aVCassini was there since 2006,
p144
aVand after a couple years looked back after it flew by Enceladus
p145
aVand surprised us all.
p146
aVEnceladus is blasting sheets of water out into the solar system
p147
aVand sloshing back down onto the moon.
p148
aVWhat a fabulous environment.
p149
aVCassini just a few months ago also flew through the plume,
p150
aVand it measured silicate particles.
p151
aVWhere does the silica come from?
p152
aVIt must come from the ocean floor.
p153
aVThe tidal energy is generated by Saturn,
p154
aVpulling and squeezing this moon \u2014
p155
aVis melting that ice,
p156
aVcreating an ocean.
p157
aVBut it's also doing that to the core.
p158
aa(lp159
VNow, the only thing that we can think of
p160
aVthat does that here on Earth as an analogy ...
p161
aVare hydrothermal vents.
p162
aVHydrothermal vents deep in our ocean were discovered in 1977.
p163
aVOceanographers were completely surprised.
p164
aVAnd now there are thousands of these below the ocean.
p165
aa(lp166
VWhat do we find?
p167
aVThe oceanographers, when they go and look at these hydrothermal vents,
p168
aVthey're teeming with life,
p169
aVregardless of whether the water is acidic or alkaline \u2014
p170
aVdoesn't matter.
p171
aVSo hydrothermal vents are a fabulous abode for life here on Earth.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo what about Enceladus?
p174
aVWell, we believe because it has water
p175
aVand has had it for a significant period of time,
p176
aVand we believe it has hydrothermal vents
p177
aVwith perhaps the right organic material,
p178
aVit is a place where life could exist.
p179
aVAnd not just microbial \u2014
p180
aVmaybe more complex because it's had time to evolve.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnother moon, very similar,
p183
aVis Europa.
p184
aVGalileo visited Jupiter's system in 1996
p185
aVand made fabulous observations of Europa.
p186
aVEuropa, we also know, has an under-the-ice crust ocean.
p187
aVGalileo mission told us that, but we never saw any plumes.
p188
aVBut we didn't look for them.
p189
aa(lp190
VHubble,
p191
aVjust a couple years ago,
p192
aVobserving Europa,
p193
aVsaw plumes of water
p194
aVspraying from the cracks in the southern hemisphere,
p195
aVjust exactly like Enceladus.
p196
aa(lp197
VThese moons,
p198
aVwhich are not in what we call a traditional habitable zone,
p199
aVthat are out in the solar system,
p200
aVhave liquid water.
p201
aVAnd if there are organics there,
p202
aVthere may be life.
p203
aa(lp204
VThis is a fabulous set of discoveries
p205
aVbecause these moons have been in this environment like that
p206
aVfor billions of years.
p207
aVLife started here on Earth, we believe, after about the first 500 million,
p208
aVand look where we are.
p209
aVThese moons are fabulous moons.
p210
aa(lp211
VAnother moon that we're looking at is Titan.
p212
aVTitan is a huge moon of Saturn.
p213
aVIt perhaps is much larger than the planet Mercury.
p214
aVIt has an extensive atmosphere.
p215
aVIt's so extensive \u2014
p216
aVand it's mostly nitrogen with a little methane and ethane \u2014
p217
aVthat you have to peer through it with radar.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd on the surface, Cassini has found liquid.
p220
aVWe see lakes ...
p221
aVactually almost the size of our Black Sea in some places.
p222
aVAnd this area is not liquid water;
p223
aVit's methane.
p224
aVIf there's any place in the solar system where life is not like us,
p225
aVwhere the substitute of water is another solvent \u2014
p226
aVand it could be methane \u2014
p227
aVit could be Titan.
p228
aa(lp229
VWell, is there life beyond Earth in the solar system?
p230
aVWe don't know yet,
p231
aVbut we're hot on the pursuit.
p232
aVThe data that we're receiving is really exciting
p233
aVand telling us \u2014
p234
aVforcing us to think about this in new and exciting ways.
p235
aVI believe we're on the right track.
p236
aVThat in the next 10 years, we will answer that question.
p237
aVAnd if we answer it,
p238
aVand it's positive,
p239
aVthen life is everywhere in the solar system.
p240
aVJust think about that.
p241
aVWe may not be alone.
p242
aa(lp243
