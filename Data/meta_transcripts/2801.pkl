VMy seven-year-old grandson sleeps just down the hall from me,
p4
aVand he wakes up a lot of mornings
p5
aVand he says,
p6
aV"You know, this could be the best day ever."
p7
aVAnd other times, in the middle of the night,
p8
aVhe calls out in a tremulous voice,
p9
aV"Nana, will you ever get sick and die?"
p10
aa(lp11
VI think this pretty much says it for me and most of the people I know,
p12
aVthat we're a mixed grill of happy anticipation
p13
aVand dread.
p14
aVSo I sat down a few days before my 61st birthday,
p15
aVand I decided to compile a list of everything I know for sure.
p16
aVThere's so little truth in the popular culture,
p17
aVand it's good to be sure of a few things.
p18
aa(lp19
VFor instance, I am no longer 47,
p20
aValthough this is the age I feel,
p21
aVand the age I like to think of myself as being.
p22
aVMy friend Paul used to say in his late 70s
p23
aVthat he felt like a young man with something really wrong with him.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VOur true person is outside of time and space,
p28
aVbut looking at the paperwork,
p29
aVI can, in fact, see that I was born in 1954.
p30
aVMy inside self is outside of time and space.
p31
aVIt doesn't have an age.
p32
aVI'm every age I've ever been, and so are you,
p33
aValthough I can't help mentioning as an aside
p34
aVthat it might have been helpful if I hadn't followed
p35
aVthe skin care rules of the '60s,
p36
aVwhich involved getting as much sun as possible
p37
aVwhile slathered in baby oil
p38
aVand basking in the glow of a tinfoil reflector shield.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Laughter)
p41
aa(lp42
VIt was so liberating, though, to face the truth
p43
aVthat I was no longer in the last throes of middle age,
p44
aVthat I decided to write down every single true thing I know.
p45
aVPeople feel really doomed and overwhelmed these days,
p46
aVand they keep asking me what's true.
p47
aVSo I hope that my list of things I'm almost positive about
p48
aVmight offer some basic operating instructions
p49
aVto anyone who is feeling really overwhelmed or beleaguered.
p50
aa(lp51
VNumber one:
p52
aVthe first and truest thing is that all truth is a paradox.
p53
aVLife is both a precious, unfathomably beautiful gift,
p54
aVand it's impossible here, on the incarnational side of things.
p55
aVIt's been a very bad match
p56
aVfor those of us who were born extremely sensitive.
p57
aVIt's so hard and weird that we sometimes wonder
p58
aVif we're being punked.
p59
aVIt's filled simultaneously with heartbreaking sweetness and beauty,
p60
aVdesperate poverty,
p61
aVfloods and babies and acne and Mozart,
p62
aVall swirled together.
p63
aVI don't think it's an ideal system.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VNumber two: almost everything will work again
p68
aVif you unplug it for a few minutes \u2014
p69
aa(lp70
V(Laughter)
p71
aa(lp72
V(Applause)
p73
aa(lp74
Vincluding you.
p75
aa(lp76
VThree: there is almost nothing outside of you
p77
aVthat will help in any kind of lasting way,
p78
aVunless you're waiting for an organ.
p79
aVYou can't buy, achieve or date serenity and peace of mind.
p80
aVThis is the most horrible truth, and I so resent it.
p81
aVBut it's an inside job,
p82
aVand we can't arrange peace or lasting improvement
p83
aVfor the people we love most in the world.
p84
aVThey have to find their own ways,
p85
aVtheir own answers.
p86
aVYou can't run alongside your grown children
p87
aVwith sunscreen and ChapStick on their hero's journey.
p88
aVYou have to release them.
p89
aVIt's disrespectful not to.
p90
aVAnd if it's someone else's problem,
p91
aVyou probably don't have the answer, anyway.
p92
aa(lp93
V(Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VOur help is usually not very helpful.
p96
aVOur help is often toxic.
p97
aVAnd help is the sunny side of control.
p98
aVStop helping so much.
p99
aVDon't get your help and goodness all over everybody.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
V(Applause)
p104
aa(lp105
VThis brings us to number four:
p106
aVeveryone is screwed up, broken, clingy and scared,
p107
aVeven the people who seem to have it most together.
p108
aVThey are much more like you than you would believe,
p109
aVso try not to compare your insides to other people's outsides.
p110
aVIt will only make you worse than you already are.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VAlso, you can't save, fix or rescue any of them
p115
aVor get anyone sober.
p116
aVWhat helped me get clean and sober 30 years ago
p117
aVwas the catastrophe of my behavior and thinking.
p118
aVSo I asked some sober friends for help,
p119
aVand I turned to a higher power.
p120
aVOne acronym for God is the "gift of desperation,"
p121
aVG-O-D,
p122
aVor as a sober friend put it,
p123
aVby the end I was deteriorating faster than I could lower my standards.
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
VSo God might mean, in this case,
p128
aV"me running out of any more good ideas."
p129
aa(lp130
VWhile fixing and saving and trying to rescue is futile,
p131
aVradical self-care is quantum,
p132
aVand it radiates out from you into the atmosphere
p133
aVlike a little fresh air.
p134
aVIt's a huge gift to the world.
p135
aVWhen people respond by saying, "Well, isn't she full of herself,"
p136
aVjust smile obliquely like Mona Lisa
p137
aVand make both of you a nice cup of tea.
p138
aVBeing full of affection for one's goofy, self-centered,
p139
aVcranky, annoying self
p140
aVis home.
p141
aVIt's where world peace begins.
p142
aa(lp143
VNumber five:
p144
aVchocolate with 75 percent cacao is not actually a food.
p145
aa(lp146
V(Laughter)
p147
aa(lp148
VIts best use is as a bait in snake traps
p149
aVor to balance the legs of wobbly chairs.
p150
aVIt was never meant to be considered an edible.
p151
aa(lp152
VNumber six \u2014
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
Vwriting.
p157
aVEvery writer you know writes really terrible first drafts,
p158
aVbut they keep their butt in the chair.
p159
aVThat's the secret of life.
p160
aVThat's probably the main difference between you and them.
p161
aVThey just do it.
p162
aVThey do it by prearrangement with themselves.
p163
aVThey do it as a debt of honor.
p164
aVThey tell stories that come through them
p165
aVone day at a time, little by little.
p166
aVWhen my older brother was in fourth grade,
p167
aVhe had a term paper on birds due the next day,
p168
aVand he hadn't started.
p169
aVSo my dad sat down with him with an Audubon book,
p170
aVpaper, pencils and brads \u2014
p171
aVfor those of you who have gotten a little less young and remember brads \u2014
p172
aVand he said to my brother,
p173
aV"Just take it bird by bird, buddy.
p174
aVJust read about pelicans
p175
aVand then write about pelicans in your own voice.
p176
aVAnd then find out about chickadees,
p177
aVand tell us about them in your own voice.
p178
aVAnd then geese."
p179
aa(lp180
VSo the two most important things about writing are: bird by bird
p181
aVand really god-awful first drafts.
p182
aVIf you don't know where to start,
p183
aVremember that every single thing that happened to you is yours,
p184
aVand you get to tell it.
p185
aVIf people wanted you to write more warmly about them,
p186
aVthey should've behaved better.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
V(Applause)
p191
aa(lp192
VYou're going to feel like hell if you wake up someday
p193
aVand you never wrote the stuff
p194
aVthat is tugging on the sleeves of your heart:
p195
aVyour stories, memories, visions and songs \u2014
p196
aVyour truth,
p197
aVyour version of things \u2014
p198
aVin your own voice.
p199
aVThat's really all you have to offer us,
p200
aVand that's also why you were born.
p201
aa(lp202
VSeven: publication and temporary creative successes
p203
aVare something you have to recover from.
p204
aVThey kill as many people as not.
p205
aVThey will hurt, damage and change you
p206
aVin ways you cannot imagine.
p207
aVThe most degraded and evil people I've ever known
p208
aVare male writers who've had huge best sellers.
p209
aVAnd yet, returning to number one, that all truth is paradox,
p210
aVit's also a miracle to get your work published,
p211
aVto get your stories read and heard.
p212
aVJust try to bust yourself gently of the fantasy
p213
aVthat publication will heal you,
p214
aVthat it will fill the Swiss-cheesy holes inside of you.
p215
aVIt can't.
p216
aVIt won't.
p217
aVBut writing can.
p218
aVSo can singing in a choir or a bluegrass band.
p219
aVSo can painting community murals or birding
p220
aVor fostering old dogs that no one else will.
p221
aa(lp222
VNumber eight: families.
p223
aVFamilies are hard, hard, hard,
p224
aVno matter how cherished and astonishing they may also be.
p225
aVAgain, see number one.
p226
aa(lp227
V(Laughter)
p228
aa(lp229
VAt family gatherings where you suddenly feel homicidal or suicidal \u2014
p230
aa(lp231
V(Laughter)
p232
aa(lp233
Vremember that in all cases,
p234
aVit's a miracle that any of us, specifically, were conceived and born.
p235
aVEarth is forgiveness school.
p236
aVIt begins with forgiving yourself,
p237
aVand then you might as well start at the dinner table.
p238
aVThat way, you can do this work in comfortable pants.
p239
aa(lp240
V(Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VWhen William Blake said that we are here
p243
aVto learn to endure the beams of love,
p244
aVhe knew that your family would be an intimate part of this,
p245
aVeven as you want to run screaming for your cute little life.
p246
aVBut I promise you are up to it.
p247
aVYou can do it, Cinderella, you can do it,
p248
aVand you will be amazed.
p249
aa(lp250
VNine: food.
p251
aVTry to do a little better.
p252
aVI think you know what I mean.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
VNumber 10 \u2014
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aa(lp260
Vgrace.
p261
aVGrace is spiritual WD-40,
p262
aVor water wings.
p263
aVThe mystery of grace is that God loves Henry Kissinger and Vladimir Putin
p264
aVand me
p265
aVexactly as much as He or She loves your new grandchild.
p266
aVGo figure.
p267
aa(lp268
V(Laughter)
p269
aa(lp270
VThe movement of grace is what changes us, heals us
p271
aVand heals our world.
p272
aVTo summon grace, say, "Help," and then buckle up.
p273
aVGrace finds you exactly where you are,
p274
aVbut it doesn't leave you where it found you.
p275
aVAnd grace won't look like Casper the Friendly Ghost,
p276
aVregrettably.
p277
aVBut the phone will ring or the mail will come
p278
aVand then against all odds,
p279
aVyou'll get your sense of humor about yourself back.
p280
aVLaughter really is carbonated holiness.
p281
aVIt helps us breathe again and again
p282
aVand gives us back to ourselves,
p283
aVand this gives us faith in life and each other.
p284
aVAnd remember \u2014 grace always bats last.
p285
aa(lp286
VEleven: God just means goodness.
p287
aVIt's really not all that scary.
p288
aVIt means the divine or a loving, animating intelligence,
p289
aVor, as we learned from the great "Deteriorata,"
p290
aV"the cosmic muffin."
p291
aVA good name for God is: "Not me."
p292
aVEmerson said that the happiest person on Earth
p293
aVis the one who learns from nature the lessons of worship.
p294
aVSo go outside a lot and look up.
p295
aVMy pastor said you can trap bees on the bottom of mason jars without lids
p296
aVbecause they don't look up,
p297
aVso they just walk around bitterly bumping into the glass walls.
p298
aVGo outside. Look up.
p299
aVSecret of life.
p300
aa(lp301
VAnd finally: death.
p302
aVNumber 12.
p303
aVWow and yikes.
p304
aVIt's so hard to bear when the few people you cannot live without die.
p305
aVYou'll never get over these losses, and no matter what the culture says,
p306
aVyou're not supposed to.
p307
aVWe Christians like to think of death as a major change of address,
p308
aVbut in any case, the person will live again fully in your heart
p309
aVif you don't seal it off.
p310
aVLike Leonard Cohen said, "There are cracks in everything,
p311
aVand that's how the light gets in."
p312
aVAnd that's how we feel our people again fully alive.
p313
aa(lp314
VAlso, the people will make you laugh out loud
p315
aVat the most inconvenient times,
p316
aVand that's the great good news.
p317
aVBut their absence will also be a lifelong nightmare of homesickness for you.
p318
aVGrief and friends, time and tears will heal you to some extent.
p319
aVTears will bathe and baptize and hydrate and moisturize you
p320
aVand the ground on which you walk.
p321
aa(lp322
VDo you know the first thing that God says to Moses?
p323
aVHe says, "Take off your shoes."
p324
aVBecause this is holy ground, all evidence to the contrary.
p325
aVIt's hard to believe, but it's the truest thing I know.
p326
aVWhen you're a little bit older, like my tiny personal self,
p327
aVyou realize that death is as sacred as birth.
p328
aVAnd don't worry \u2014 get on with your life.
p329
aVAlmost every single death is easy and gentle
p330
aVwith the very best people surrounding you
p331
aVfor as long as you need.
p332
aVYou won't be alone.
p333
aVThey'll help you cross over to whatever awaits us.
p334
aVAs Ram Dass said,
p335
aV"When all is said and done,
p336
aVwe're really just all walking each other home."
p337
aa(lp338
VI think that's it,
p339
aVbut if I think of anything else,
p340
aVI'll let you know.
p341
aa(lp342
VThank you.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Applause)
p345
aa(lp346
VThank you.
p347
aa(lp348
V(Applause)
p349
aa(lp350
VI was very surprised to be asked to come,
p351
aVbecause it is not my realm,
p352
aVtechnology or design or entertainment.
p353
aVI mean, my realm is sort of faith and writing
p354
aVand kind of lurching along together.
p355
aVAnd I was surprised,
p356
aVbut they said I could give a talk, and I said I'd love to.
p357
aa(lp358
V(Video) If you don't know where to start,
p359
aVremember that every single thing that happened to you is yours
p360
aVand you get to tell it.
p361
aa(lp362
VAnne Lamott: People are very frightened and feel really doomed
p363
aVin America these days,
p364
aVand I just wanted to help people get their sense of humor about it
p365
aVand to realize how much isn't a problem.
p366
aVIf you take an action,
p367
aVtake a really healthy or loving or friendly action,
p368
aVyou'll have loving and friendly feelings.
