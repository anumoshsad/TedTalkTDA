VToday, more than half of the world's population lives in cities.
p4
aVThe urbanization process started in the late 1700s
p5
aVand has been increasing since then.
p6
aVThe prediction is that by 2050,
p7
aV66 percent of the population will live in cities
p8
aVand the United Nations, the World Health Organization,
p9
aVthe World Economic Forum, are warning us,
p10
aVif we don't plan for the increased density,
p11
aVcurrent problems in our cities, like inequality, congestion, crime
p12
aVcan only get worse.
p13
aVAs a result, urban planners and city developers
p14
aVare putting a lot of effort and creativity
p15
aVin designing our future, denser, bigger cities.
p16
aa(lp17
VBut I have a different opinion.
p18
aVI think urbanization is actually reaching the end of its cycle,
p19
aVand now people are going to start moving back to the countryside.
p20
aVAnd you may think, "But what about the trend?"
p21
aVWell, let me tell you,
p22
aVsocioeconomic trends don't last forever.
p23
aVYou know, 12,000 years ago
p24
aVeverybody was perfectly happy
p25
aVroaming the land, hunting and gathering.
p26
aVAnd then, the trend changes,
p27
aVand the new thing is to live in a farm and have cattle,
p28
aVuntil it changes again.
p29
aVWhen we get to the industrial revolution.
p30
aVActually, that is what started the urbanization process.
p31
aVAnd you know what triggered it?
p32
aVSteam power, machines,
p33
aVnew chemical processes \u2014
p34
aVin two words, technological innovation.
p35
aVAnd I believe technology can also bring the end of this cycle.
p36
aa(lp37
VI've been working on innovation for most of my career.
p38
aVI love it. I love my job.
p39
aVIt allows me to work with drones, with 3D printers and smart glasses,
p40
aVand not just those you can buy in the shop but also prototypes.
p41
aVIt's a lot of fun sometimes.
p42
aVNow, some of these technologies
p43
aVare opening new possibilities that will radically change
p44
aVthe way we did things before
p45
aVand in a few years,
p46
aVthey may allow us to enjoy the benefits of city life
p47
aVfrom anywhere.
p48
aVThink about it.
p49
aVIf you could live in a place with a lower crime rate
p50
aVand more space
p51
aVand a lower cost of living
p52
aVand less traffic,
p53
aVof course many people would want that,
p54
aVbut they feel they don't have a choice.
p55
aVYou have to live in the city.
p56
aa(lp57
VWell, in the past, people moved to the cities
p58
aVnot because they loved the city itself
p59
aVbut for the things you could have in a city,
p60
aVmore job opportunities,
p61
aVeasier access to services and goods
p62
aVand a rich social life.
p63
aVSo let's dive deeper.
p64
aa(lp65
VMore jobs and career opportunities.
p66
aVIs that still true today,
p67
aVbecause the office people are starting to realize
p68
aVthat working in the office and being in the office
p69
aVmay not be the same thing anymore.
p70
aVAccording to a study by Global Workplace Analytics,
p71
aVmore than 80 percent of the US workforce would like to work from home.
p72
aVAnd do you know how much it costs for a company to even have an office?
p73
aV11,000 dollars per employee per year.
p74
aVIf only half of those workers
p75
aVwould telework even 50 percent of the time,
p76
aVthe savings in the states would exceed 500 billion dollars,
p77
aVand it could reduce greenhouse gases by 54 million tons.
p78
aVThat is the equivalent
p79
aVof 10 million cars off the streets for a whole year.
p80
aVBut even though most people would want to telework,
p81
aVcurrent technology makes the experience isolating.
p82
aVIt's not comfortable.
p83
aVIt doesn't feel like being there.
p84
aVBut that is going to change
p85
aVby the convergence of two technologies:
p86
aVaugmented reality and telepresence robots.
p87
aa(lp88
VAugmented reality already today
p89
aVallows you to take your office environment everywhere with you.
p90
aVAll you need is a wearable computer, a pair of smart glasses,
p91
aVand you can take your emails and your spreadsheets
p92
aVwith you wherever you go.
p93
aVAnd video conferences and video calls have become very common these days,
p94
aVbut they still need improvement.
p95
aVI mean, all those little faces on a flat screen,
p96
aVsometimes you don't even know who is talking.
p97
aa(lp98
VNow, we already have something way better than static videocalls:
p99
aVyour average telepresence robot.
p100
aVI call it tablet on a stick.
p101
aa(lp102
V(Laughter)
p103
aa(lp104
VYou can control, you can move around,
p105
aVyou can control what you're looking at.
p106
aVIt's way better, but far from perfect.
p107
aVYou know how they say
p108
aVthat most human communication is nonverbal?
p109
aVWell, the robot doesn't give you any of that.
p110
aVIt looks like an alien.
p111
aVBut with advances in augmented reality,
p112
aVit will be easy to wrap the robot in a nice hologram
p113
aVthat actually looks and moves like a person.
p114
aVThat will do it.
p115
aVOr else, forget the robot.
p116
aVWe go full VR,
p117
aVand everybody meets in cyberspace.
p118
aVGive it a couple of years and that will feel so real,
p119
aVyou won't tell the difference.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo what was the next reason why people move to cities?
p122
aVAccess to services and goods.
p123
aVBut today you can do all that online.
p124
aVAccording to a study made by comScore,
p125
aVonline shoppers in the US last year
p126
aVdid more than half of their retail purchases online,
p127
aVand the global market for e-commerce
p128
aVis estimated to be at two trillion dollars.
p129
aVAnd it's expected to reach 2.38 by the end of 2017,
p130
aVaccording to eMarketer.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, from a logistics standpoint,
p133
aVdensity is good for deliveries.
p134
aVSupplying goods to a shopping mall is easy.
p135
aVYou can send big shipments to the shop,
p136
aVand people will go there, pick it up and take it home themselves.
p137
aVE-commerce means we need to ship onesies
p138
aVand have them home delivered.
p139
aVThat's more expensive.
p140
aVIt's like the difference between having a birthday party for 20 people
p141
aVor bringing a piece of the cake
p142
aVto each of your 20 friends at their place.
p143
aVBut at least in the city,
p144
aVthey live close to each other.
p145
aVDensity helps.
p146
aVNow, e-commerce deliveries in the countryside,
p147
aVthose take forever.
p148
aVThe truck sometimes needs to drive miles between one address and the next one.
p149
aVThose are the most expensive deliveries of all.
p150
aa(lp151
VBut we already have a solution for that:
p152
aVdrones.
p153
aVA vehicle carrying a squadron of drones.
p154
aVThe driver does some of the deliveries
p155
aVwhile the drones are flying back and forth from the truck as it moves.
p156
aVThat way, the average cost for delivery is reduced,
p157
aVand voila:
p158
aVaffordable e-commerce services in the countryside.
p159
aVYou will see:
p160
aVthe new homes of our teleworkers
p161
aVwill probably have a drone pod in the yard.
p162
aVSo once the final mile delivery is not a problem,
p163
aVyou don't need to be in the city to buy things anymore.
p164
aVSo that's two.
p165
aa(lp166
VNow, what was the third reason why people move to cities?
p167
aVA rich social life.
p168
aVThey would need to be in the city for that these days.
p169
aVBecause people these days,
p170
aVthey make friends, they chat, gossip and flirt
p171
aVfrom the comfort of their sofa.
p172
aa(lp173
V(Laughter)
p174
aa(lp175
VAnd while wearing their favorite pajamas.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VThere are over two billion active social media users in the world.
p180
aVIn a way, that makes you think like we are connected
p181
aVno matter where we are.
p182
aVBut OK, not completely.
p183
aVSometimes you still need some real human contact.
p184
aVIronically, the city, with its population density,
p185
aVis not always the best for that.
p186
aVActually, as social groups become smaller,
p187
aVthey grow stronger.
p188
aVA recent study made in the UK
p189
aVby the Office for National Statistics
p190
aVshowed a higher life satisfaction rating
p191
aVamong people living in rural areas.
p192
aVSo as people settle in the countryside,
p193
aVwell, they will buy local groceries,
p194
aVfresh groceries, foodstuff,
p195
aVmaintenance services.
p196
aVSo handymen, small workshops, service companies will thrive.
p197
aVMaybe some of the industrial workers from the cities
p198
aVdisplaced by the automation
p199
aVwill find a nice alternative job here,
p200
aVand they will move too.
p201
aVAnd as people move to the countryside,
p202
aVhow is that going to be?
p203
aVThink about autonomous,
p204
aVoff-the-grid houses with solar panels,
p205
aVwith wind turbines and waste recycling utilities,
p206
aVour new homes producing their own energy and using it to also power the family car.
p207
aVI mean, cities have always been regarded as being more energy-efficient,
p208
aVbut let me tell you,
p209
aVrepopulating the countryside can be eco too.
p210
aa(lp211
VBy now, you're probably thinking of all the advantages of country living.
p212
aa(lp213
V(Laughter)
p214
aa(lp215
VI did it myself.
p216
aVSix years ago, my wife and I, we packed our stuff,
p217
aVwe sold our little apartment in Spain,
p218
aVand for the same money we bought a house with a garden
p219
aVand little birds that come singing in the morning.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VIt's so nice there.
p224
aVAnd we live in a small village, not really the countryside yet.
p225
aVThat is going to be my next move:
p226
aVa refurbished farmhouse,
p227
aVnot too far from a city, not too close.
p228
aVAnd now we'll make sure to have a good spot for drones to land.
p229
aa(lp230
V(Laughter)
p231
aa(lp232
VBut hey, that's me.
p233
aVIt doesn't have to be you,
p234
aVbecause it would seem like I'm trying to convince somebody
p235
aVto come join us in the country.
p236
aVI'm not.
p237
aa(lp238
V(Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
VI don't need more people to come.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Laughter)
p243
aa(lp244
VI just think they will
p245
aVonce they realize they can have the same benefits the city has.
p246
aVBut if you don't like the country,
p247
aVI have good news for you, too.
p248
aVCities will not disappear.
p249
aVBut as people move out,
p250
aVa lower density will help them recover a better flow and balance.
p251
aa(lp252
VAnyway, I guess now you have some thinking to do.
p253
aVDo you still think you need to live in the city?
p254
aVAnd more importantly,
p255
aVdo you want to?
p256
aa(lp257
VThank you very much.
p258
aa(lp259
