VJust to put everything in context,
p4
aVand to kind of give you a background to where I'm coming from,
p5
aVso that a lot of the things I'm going to say,
p6
aVand the things I'm going to do \u2014
p7
aVor things I'm going to tell you I've done \u2014
p8
aVyou will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am.
p9
aVI graduated high school in Cleveland, Ohio, 1975.
p10
aVAnd just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad, we went back home.
p11
aVFinished university education, got a medical degree, 1986.
p12
aVAnd by the time I was an intern house officer,
p13
aVI could barely afford to maintain my mother's 13-year-old car \u2014
p14
aVand I was a paid doctor.
p15
aVThis brings us to why a lot of us, who are professionals,
p16
aVare now, as they say, in diaspora.
p17
aVNow, are we going to make that a permanent thing,
p18
aVwhere we all get trained, and we leave, and we don't go back?
p19
aVPerhaps not, I should certainly hope not \u2014
p20
aVbecause that is not my vision.
p21
aa(lp22
VAll right, for good measure, that's where Nigeria is on the African map,
p23
aVand just there is the Delta region that I'm sure everybody's heard of.
p24
aVPeople getting kidnapped, where the oil comes from,
p25
aVthe oil that sometimes I think has driven us all crazy in Nigeria.
p26
aVBut, critical poverty: this slide is from a presentation I gave
p27
aVnot that long ago. Gapminder.org tells the story of the gap
p28
aVbetween Africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care.
p29
aVVery interesting.
p30
aa(lp31
VHow many people do you think are on that taxi?
p32
aVAnd believe it or not, that is a taxi in Nigeria.
p33
aVAnd the capital \u2014 well, what used to be the capital of Nigeria \u2014 Lagos,
p34
aVthat's a taxi, and you have police on them.
p35
aVSo, tell me, how many policemen do you think are on this taxi? And now? Three.
p36
aVSo, when these kind of people \u2014 and, believe me, it's not just the police
p37
aVthat use these taxis in Lagos. We all do. I've been on one of these,
p38
aVand I didn't have a helmet, either.
p39
aVAnd it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us
p40
aVon a taxi like this falls off, has an accident and needs a hospital.
p41
aa(lp42
VBelieve it or not, some of us do survive.
p43
aVSome of us do survive malaria; we do survive AIDS.
p44
aVAnd like I tell my family, and my wife reminds me every time,
p45
aV"You're risking your life, you know, every time you go to that country."
p46
aVAnd she's right. Every time you go there,
p47
aVyou know that if you actually need critical care \u2014
p48
aVcritical care of any sort \u2014 if you have an accident \u2014
p49
aVof which there are many, there are accidents everywhere \u2014
p50
aVwhere do they go?
p51
aVWhere do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff?
p52
aVI'm not saying instead of, I'm saying as well as,
p53
aVAIDS, TB, malaria, typhoid \u2014 the list goes on.
p54
aVI'm saying, where do they go when they're like me?
p55
aVWhen I go back home \u2014 and I do all kinds of things,
p56
aVI teach, I train \u2014 but I catch one of these things,
p57
aVor I'm chronically ill with one of those, where do they go?
p58
aVWhat's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled?
p59
aa(lp60
VI think it's quite significant. This is where they go.
p61
aVThese are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden \u2014
p62
aVthis is a major hospital. In fact, it's from a major teaching hospital in Nigeria.
p63
aVNow that is less than a year old, in an operating room.
p64
aVThat's sterilizing equipment in Nigeria.
p65
aVYou remember all that oil?
p66
aVYes, I'm sorry if it upsets some of you, but
p67
aVI think you need to see this. That's the floor, OK?
p68
aVYou can say some of this is education.
p69
aVYou can say it's hygiene. I'm not pleading poverty.
p70
aVI'm saying we need more than just, you know, vaccination,
p71
aVmalaria, AIDS, because I want to be treated
p72
aVin a proper hospital if something happens to me out there.
p73
aVIn fact, when I start running around saying,
p74
aV"Hey, boys and girls, you're cardiologists in the U.S.,
p75
aVcan you come home with me and do a mission?"
p76
aVI want them to think, "Well there's some hope."
p77
aa(lp78
VNow, have a look at that. That's the anesthesiology machine.
p79
aVAnd that's my specialty, right?
p80
aVAnesthesiology and critical care \u2014 look at that bag.
p81
aVIt's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the U.K.
p82
aVAnd believe me, these are current pictures.
p83
aVNow, if something like this, which has happened in the U.K.,
p84
aVthat's where they go. This is the intensive care unit in which I work.
p85
aa(lp86
VAll right, this is a slide from a talk I gave
p87
aVabout intensive care units in Nigeria,
p88
aVand jokingly we refer to it as "Expensive Scare."
p89
aVBecause it's scary and it's expensive, but we need to have it, OK?
p90
aVSo, these are the problems.
p91
aVThere are no prizes for telling us what the problems are, are there?
p92
aVI think we all know. And several speakers before
p93
aVand speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems.
p94
aVThese are a few of them. So, what did I do?
p95
aa(lp96
VThere we go \u2014 we're going on a mission.
p97
aVWe're going to do some open-heart surgery. I was the only Brit,
p98
aVon a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons,
p99
aVcardiac nurse, intensive care nurse.
p100
aVWe all went out and did a mission and we've done three of them so far.
p101
aVJust so you know, I do believe in missions, I do believe in aid
p102
aVand I do believe in charity. They have their place,
p103
aVbut where do they go for those things we talked about earlier?
p104
aVBecause it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission.
p105
aVHealth is wealth, in the words of Hans Rosling.
p106
aVYou get wealthier faster if you are healthy first.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo, here we are, mission. Big trouble.
p109
aVOpen-heart surgery in Nigeria \u2014 big trouble.
p110
aVThat's Mike, Mike comes out from Mississippi.
p111
aVDoes he look like he's happy?
p112
aVIt took us two days just to organize the place, but hey,
p113
aVyou know, we worked on it. Does he look happy?
p114
aVYes, that's the medical advice the committee chairman says,
p115
aV"Yes, I told you, you weren't going to be able to,
p116
aVyou can't do this, I just know it."
p117
aVLook, that's the technician we had. So yes, you go on, all right?
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VI got him to come with me \u2014 anesthesia tech \u2014 come with me from the U.K.
p122
aVYes, let's just go work this thing out.
p123
aVSee, that's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally.
p124
aVWe get a lot of donated equipment.
p125
aVEquipment that's obsolete, equipment that doesn't quite work,
p126
aVor it works and you can't fix it. And there's nothing wrong with that,
p127
aVso long as we use it and we move on.
p128
aa(lp129
VBut we had problems with it. We had severe problems there.
p130
aVHe had to get on the phone. This guy was always on the phone.
p131
aVSo what we going to do now?
p132
aVIt looks like all these Americans are here and
p133
aVyes, one Brit, and he's not going to do anything \u2014
p134
aVhe thinks he's British actually, and he's actually Nigerian,
p135
aVI just thought about that.
p136
aVWe eventually got it working, is the truth,
p137
aVbut it was one of these. Even older than the one you saw.
p138
aa(lp139
VThe reason I have this picture here, this X-ray,
p140
aVit's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X-rays.
p141
aVDo you figure where that is? It was on a window.
p142
aVI mean, what's an X-ray viewing box? Please.
p143
aVWell, nowadays everything's on PAX anyway.
p144
aVYou look at your X-rays on a screen and you do stuff with them,
p145
aVyou email them. But we were still using X-rays,
p146
aVbut we didn't even have a viewing box!
p147
aVAnd we were doing open-heart surgery.
p148
aa(lp149
VOK, I know it's not AIDS, I know it's not malaria,
p150
aVbut we still need this stuff. Oh yeah, echo \u2014
p151
aVthis was just to get the children ready and the adults ready.
p152
aVPeople still believe in Voodoo. Heart disease,
p153
aVVSD, hole in the heart, tetralogies.
p154
aVYou still get people who believe in it and they came.
p155
aVAt 67 percent oxygen saturation, the normal is about 97.
p156
aVHer condition, open-heart surgery that as she required,
p157
aVwould have been treated when she was a child.
p158
aVWe had to do these for adults. So, we did succeed and we still do.
p159
aVWe've done three. We're planning another one in July
p160
aVin the north of the country. So, we certainly still do open-heart,
p161
aVbut you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in \u2014
p162
aVwe ship everything, instruments. We had explosions
p163
aVbecause the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it.
p164
aVThe oxygen tanks didn't quite work right.
p165
aa(lp166
VBut how many did we do the first one? 12.
p167
aVWe did 12 open-heart surgical patients successfully.
p168
aVHere is our very first patient, out of intensive care,
p169
aVand just watch that chair, all right?
p170
aVThis is what I mean about appropriate technology.
p171
aVThat's what he was doing, propping up the bed because the bed simply didn't work.
p172
aVHave you seen one of those before?
p173
aVNo? Yes? Doesn't matter, it worked.
p174
aVI'm sure you've all seen or heard this before:
p175
aV"We, the willing, have been doing so much with so little for so long \u2014
p176
aa(lp177
V(Applause)
p178
aV\u2014 we are now qualified to do anything with nothing."
p179
aa(lp180
V(Applause)
p181
aa(lp182
VThank you. Sustainable Solutions \u2014 this was my first company.
p183
aVThis one's sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing.
p184
aVSo, we put my hand in my pocket and say, "Guys, let's just buy stuff.
p185
aVLet's go set up a company that teaches people, educates them,
p186
aVgives them the tools they need to keep going."
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd that's a perfect example of one.
p189
aVUsually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital,
p190
aVyou buy a different one for children,
p191
aVyou buy a different one for transport. This one will do everything,
p192
aVand it will do it at half the price and doesn't need compressed air.
p193
aVIf you're in America and you don't know about this one, we do,
p194
aVbecause we make it our duty to find out
p195
aVwhat's appropriate technology for Africa \u2014 what's appropriately priced,
p196
aVdoes the job, and we move on. Anesthesia machine:
p197
aVmulti-parameter monitor, operating lights, suction.
p198
aVThis little unit here \u2014 remember your little 12-volt plug in the car,
p199
aVthat charges your, whatever, Game Boy, telephone?
p200
aVThat's exactly how the outlets are designed.
p201
aVYes, it will take a solar panel. Yes a solar panel will charge it.
p202
aVBut if you've got mains as well, it will charge the batteries in there.
p203
aVAnd guess what? We have a little pedal charger too, just in case.
p204
aVAnd guess what, if it all fails,
p205
aVif you can find a car that's still got a live battery
p206
aVand you stick it in, it will still work. Then you can customize it.
p207
aVIs it dental surgery you want? General surgery you want?
p208
aVDecide which instruments, stock it up with consumables.
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd currently we're working on oxygen \u2014 oxygen delivery on-site.
p211
aVThe technology for oxygen delivery is not new.
p212
aVOxygen concentrators are very old technology. What is new,
p213
aVand what we will have in a few months, I hope,
p214
aVis that ability to use this same renewable energy system
p215
aVto provide and produce oxygen on site. Zeolite \u2014 it's not new \u2014
p216
aVzeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is 78 percent of air.
p217
aVIf you take nitrogen out, what's left? Oxygen, pretty much.
p218
aVSo that's not new. What we're doing is applying this technology to it.
p219
aa(lp220
VThese are the basic features of my device, or our device.
p221
aVThis is what makes it so special.
p222
aVApart from the awards it's won,
p223
aVit's portable and it's certified. It's registered, the MHRA \u2014
p224
aVand the CE mark, for those who don't know, for Europe, is the equivalent
p225
aVof the FDA in the U.S.
p226
aVIf you compare it with what's on the market, price-wise,
p227
aVsize-wise, ease of use, complexity ...
p228
aa(lp229
VThis picture was taken last year.
p230
aVThese are members of my graduating class, 1986.
p231
aVIt was in this gentleman's house in the Potomac,
p232
aVfor those of you who are familiar with Maryland.
p233
aVThere are too many of us outside and everybody,
p234
aVjust to borrow a bit from Hans \u2014 Hans Rosling, he's my guy \u2014
p235
aVif the size of the text represents what gets the most attention,
p236
aVit's the problems. But what we really need are African solutions
p237
aVthat are appropriate for Africa \u2014 looking at the culture,
p238
aVlooking at the people, looking at how much money they've got.
p239
aVAfrican people, because they will do it with a passion, I hope.
p240
aVAnd lots and lots of that little bit down there, sacrifice.
p241
aVYou have to do it. Africans have to do it,
p242
aVin conjunction with everyone else.
p243
aa(lp244
VThank you.
