VIn 1991 I had
p4
aVmaybe the most profound and transformative
p5
aVexperience of my life.
p6
aVI was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree.
p7
aVI took a couple victory laps in there.
p8
aVAnd I was on a college choir tour up in Northern California,
p9
aVand we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus,
p10
aVand we were relaxing next to this beautiful
p11
aVidyllic lake in the mountains.
p12
aVAnd there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise,
p13
aVand as we sat there, over the mountains coming in
p14
aVfrom the north were these Steven Spielbergian clouds
p15
aVrolling toward us,
p16
aVand as the clouds got about halfway over the valley,
p17
aVso help me God, every single animal in that place
p18
aVstopped making noise at the same time.
p19
aV(Whoosh) This electric hush, as if they could sense what was about to happen.
p20
aVAnd then the clouds came over us, and then,
p21
aVboom! This massive thunderclap, and sheets of rain.
p22
aVIt was just extraordinary, and when I came back home
p23
aVI found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz,
p24
aVand decided to set it to music,
p25
aVa piece for choir called "Cloudburst,"
p26
aVwhich is the piece that we'll perform for you in just a moment.
p27
aa(lp28
VNow fast forward to just three years ago.
p29
aV(Music) And we released to YouTube this,
p30
aVthe Virtual Choir Project,
p31
aV185 singers from 12 different countries.
p32
aVYou can see my little video there conducting these people,
p33
aValone in their dorm rooms
p34
aVor in their living rooms at home.
p35
aVTwo years ago, on this very stage, we premiered
p36
aVVirtual Choir 2,
p37
aV2,052 singers from 58 different countries,
p38
aVthis time performing a piece that I had written called "Sleep."
p39
aVAnd then just last spring we released Virtual Choir 3,
p40
aV"Water Night," another piece that I had written,
p41
aVthis time nearly 4,000 singers from 73 different countries.
p42
aV(Music)
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd when I was speaking to Chris about the future
p45
aVof Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this,
p46
aVhe challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could.
p47
aVCould we do this all in real time?
p48
aVCould we have people singing together in real time?
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd with the help of Skype,
p51
aVthat is what we are going to attempt today.
p52
aVNow, we'll perform "Cloudburst" for you.
p53
aVThe first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage.
p54
aVI'm joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach,
p55
aVCal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College,
p56
aVsome of the best amateur choirs in the country, and \u2014
p57
aV(Applause) \u2014
p58
aVand in the second half of the piece,
p59
aVthe virtual choir will join us, 30 different singers
p60
aVfrom 30 different countries.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow, we've pushed the technology as far as it can go,
p63
aVbut there's still less than a second of latency,
p64
aVbut in musical terms, that's a lifetime.
p65
aVWe deal in milliseconds.
p66
aVSo what I've done is, I've adapted "Cloudburst"
p67
aVso that it embraces the latency
p68
aVand the performers sing into the latency
p69
aVinstead of trying to be exactly together.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo with deep humility, and for your approval,
p72
aVwe present "Cloudburst."
