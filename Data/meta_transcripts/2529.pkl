VI'll never forget the sound
p4
aVof laughing with my friends.
p5
aVI'll never forget the sound
p6
aVof my mother's voice right before I fell asleep.
p7
aVAnd I'll never forget the comforting sound of water
p8
aVtrickling down a stream.
p9
aVImagine my fear, pure fear,
p10
aVwhen, at the age of 10,
p11
aVI was told I was going to lose my hearing.
p12
aVAnd over the next five years,
p13
aVit progressed until I was classified as profoundly deaf.
p14
aa(lp15
VBut I believe that losing my hearing
p16
aVwas one of the greatest gifts I've ever received.
p17
aVYou see, I get to experience the world in a unique way.
p18
aVAnd I believe that these unique experiences
p19
aVthat people with disabilities have
p20
aVis what's going to help us make and design a better world
p21
aVfor everyone \u2014 both for people with and without disabilities.
p22
aa(lp23
VI used to be a disability rights lawyer,
p24
aVand I spent a lot of my time focused on enforcing the law,
p25
aVensuring that accommodations were made.
p26
aVAnd then I had to quickly learn international policy,
p27
aVbecause I was asked to work on the UN Convention
p28
aVthat protects people with disabilities.
p29
aVAs the leader of the NGO there,
p30
aVI spent most of my energy trying to convince people
p31
aVabout the capabilities of people with disabilities.
p32
aVBut somewhere along the way,
p33
aVand after many career transitions
p34
aVthat my parents weren't so happy about \u2014
p35
aa(lp36
V(Laughter)
p37
aa(lp38
VI stumbled upon a solution
p39
aVthat I believe may be an even more powerful tool
p40
aVto solve some of the world's greatest problems,
p41
aVdisability or not.
p42
aVAnd that tool is called design thinking.
p43
aa(lp44
VDesign thinking is a process for innovation and problem solving.
p45
aVThere are five steps.
p46
aVThe first is defining the problem
p47
aVand understanding its constraints.
p48
aVThe second is observing people in real-life situations
p49
aVand empathizing with them.
p50
aVThird, throwing out hundreds of ideas \u2014 the more the better,
p51
aVthe wilder the better.
p52
aVFourth, prototyping: gathering whatever you can,
p53
aVwhatever you can find,
p54
aVto mimic your solution, to test it
p55
aVand to refine it.
p56
aVAnd finally, implementation:
p57
aVensuring that the solution you came up with is sustainable.
p58
aa(lp59
VWarren Berger says that design thinking teaches us to look sideways,
p60
aVto reframe, to refine, to experiment
p61
aVand, probably most importantly,
p62
aVask those stupid questions.
p63
aVDesign thinkers believe that everyone is creative.
p64
aVThey believe in bringing people from multiple disciplines together,
p65
aVbecause they want to share multiple perspectives
p66
aVand bring them together and ultimately merge them
p67
aVto form something new.
p68
aa(lp69
VDesign thinking is such a successful and versatile tool
p70
aVthat it has been applied in almost every industry.
p71
aVI saw the potential that it had for the issues I faced,
p72
aVso I decided to go back to school
p73
aVand get my master's in social design.
p74
aVThis looks at how to use design to create positive change in the world.
p75
aVWhile I was there,
p76
aVI fell in love with woodworking.
p77
aVBut what I quickly realized
p78
aVwas that I was missing out on something.
p79
aVAs you're working with a tool,
p80
aVright before it's about to kick back at you \u2014
p81
aVwhich means the piece or the tool jumps back at you \u2014
p82
aVit makes a sound.
p83
aVAnd I couldn't hear this sound.
p84
aVSo I decided,
p85
aVwhy not try and solve it?
p86
aVMy solution was a pair of safety glasses
p87
aVthat were engineered to visually alert the user
p88
aVto pitch changes in the tool,
p89
aVbefore the human ear could pick it up.
p90
aVWhy hadn't tool designers thought of this before?
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VTwo reasons: one, I was a beginner.
p95
aVI wasn't weighed down by expertise or conventional wisdom.
p96
aVThe second is: I was Deaf.
p97
aVMy unique experience of the world helped inform my solution.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd as I went on, I kept running into more and more solutions
p100
aVthat were originally made for people with disabilities,
p101
aVand that ended up being picked up,
p102
aVembraced and loved by the mainstream,
p103
aVdisability or not.
p104
aVThis is an OXO potato peeler.
p105
aVIt was originally designed for people with arthritis,
p106
aVbut it was so comfortable, everybody loved it.
p107
aVText messaging: that was originally designed for people who are Deaf.
p108
aVAnd as you know, everybody loves that, too.
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
VI started thinking:
p113
aVWhat if we changed our mindset?
p114
aVWhat if we started designing for disability first \u2014
p115
aVnot the norm?
p116
aVAs you see, when we design for disability first,
p117
aVwe often stumble upon solutions that are not only inclusive,
p118
aVbut also are often better than when we design for the norm.
p119
aa(lp120
VAnd this excites me,
p121
aVbecause this means that the energy it takes to accommodate someone
p122
aVwith a disability
p123
aVcan be leveraged, molded and played with
p124
aVas a force for creativity and innovation.
p125
aVThis moves us from the mindset of trying to change the hearts
p126
aVand the deficiency mindset of tolerance,
p127
aVto becoming an alchemist,
p128
aVthe type of magician that this world so desperately needs
p129
aVto solve some of its greatest problems.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow, I also believe
p132
aVthat people with disabilities have great potential to be designers
p133
aVwithin this design-thinking process.
p134
aVWithout knowing it, from a very early age,
p135
aVI've been a design thinker, fine-tuning my skills.
p136
aVDesign thinkers are, by nature, problem solvers.
p137
aVSo imagine listening to a conversation
p138
aVand only understanding 50 percent of what is said.
p139
aVYou can't ask them to repeat every single word.
p140
aVThey would just get frustrated with you.
p141
aVSo without even realizing it,
p142
aVmy solution was to take the muffled sound I heard,
p143
aVthat was the beat,
p144
aVand turn it into a rhythm and place it with the lips I read.
p145
aVYears later, someone commented that my writing had a rhythm to it.
p146
aVWell, this is because I experience conversations as rhythms.
p147
aVI also became really, really good at failing.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Laughter)
p150
aa(lp151
VQuite literally.
p152
aVMy first semester in Spanish, I got a D.
p153
aVBut what I learned was that when I picked myself up
p154
aVand changed a few things around,
p155
aVeventually, I succeeded.
p156
aVSimilarly, design thinking encourages people to fail
p157
aVand fail often,
p158
aVbecause eventually, you will succeed.
p159
aVVery few great innovations in this world
p160
aVhave come from someone succeeding on the first try.
p161
aa(lp162
VI also experienced this lesson in sports.
p163
aVI'll never forget my coach saying to my mom,
p164
aV"If she just didn't have her hearing loss,
p165
aVshe would be on the national team."
p166
aVBut what my coach, and what I didn't even know at the time,
p167
aVwas that my hearing loss actually helped me excel at sports.
p168
aVYou see, when you lose your hearing, not only do you adapt your behavior,
p169
aVbut you also adapt your physical senses.
p170
aVOne example of this
p171
aVis that my visual attention span increased.
p172
aVImagine a soccer player, coming down the left flank.
p173
aVImagine being goalkeeper, like I was,
p174
aVand the ball is coming down the left flank.
p175
aVA person with normal hearing would have the visual perspective of this.
p176
aVI had the benefit of a spectrum this wide.
p177
aVSo I picked up the players over here,
p178
aVthat were moving about and coming down the field.
p179
aVAnd I picked them up quicker, so that if the ball was passed,
p180
aVI could reposition myself and be ready for that shot.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo as you can see,
p183
aVI've been a design thinker for nearly all my life.
p184
aVMy observation skills have been honed so that I pick up on things
p185
aVthat others would never pick up on.
p186
aVMy constant need to adapt has made me a great ideator
p187
aVand problem solver.
p188
aVAnd I've often had to do this within limitations and constraints.
p189
aVThis is something that designers also have to deal with frequently.
p190
aa(lp191
VMy work most recently took me to Haiti.
p192
aVDesign thinkers often seek out extreme situations,
p193
aVbecause that often informs some of their best designs.
p194
aVAnd Haiti \u2014 it was like a perfect storm.
p195
aa(lp196
VI lived and worked with 300 Deaf individuals
p197
aVthat were relocated after the 2010 earthquake.
p198
aVBut five and a half years later,
p199
aVthere still was no electricity;
p200
aVthere still was no safe drinking water;
p201
aVthere were still no job opportunities;
p202
aVthere was still rampant crime, and it went unpunished.
p203
aVInternational aid organizations came one by one.
p204
aVBut they came
p205
aVwith pre-determined solutions.
p206
aVThey didn't come ready to observe and to adapt
p207
aVbased on the community's needs.
p208
aVOne organization gave them goats and chickens.
p209
aVBut they didn't realize
p210
aVthat there was so much hunger in that community,
p211
aVthat when the Deaf went to sleep at night and couldn't hear,
p212
aVpeople broke into their yards and their homes
p213
aVand stole these chickens and goats,
p214
aVand eventually they were all gone.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow, if that organization had taken the time
p217
aVto observe Deaf people, to observe the community,
p218
aVthey would have realized their problem
p219
aVand perhaps they would have come up with a solution,
p220
aVsomething like a solar light,
p221
aVlighting up a secure pen to put them in at night
p222
aVto ensure their safety.
p223
aa(lp224
VYou don't have to be a design thinker
p225
aVto insert the ideas I've shared with you today.
p226
aVYou are creative.
p227
aVYou are a designer \u2014
p228
aVeveryone is.
p229
aVLet people like me help you.
p230
aVLet people with disabilities help you look sideways,
p231
aVand in the process,
p232
aVsolve some of the greatest problems.
p233
aa(lp234
VThat's it. Thank you.
