VNow, I don't usually like cartoons,
p4
aVI don't think many of them are funny,
p5
aVI find them weird. But I love this cartoon from the New Yorker.
p6
aa(lp7
V(Text: Never, ever think outside the box.) (Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VSo, the guy is telling the cat,
p10
aVdon't you dare think outside the box.
p11
aVWell, I'm afraid I used to be the cat.
p12
aVI always wanted to be outside the box.
p13
aVAnd it's partly because I came to this field
p14
aVfrom a different background, chemist and a bacterial geneticist.
p15
aVSo, what people were saying to me
p16
aVabout the cause of cancer, sources of cancer,
p17
aVor, for that matter, why you are who you are,
p18
aVdidn't make sense.
p19
aa(lp20
VSo, let me quickly try and tell you why I thought that
p21
aVand how I went about it.
p22
aVSo, to begin with, however,
p23
aVI have to give you a very, very quick lesson
p24
aVin developmental biology,
p25
aVwith apologies to those of you who know some biology.
p26
aVSo, when your mom and dad met,
p27
aVthere is a fertilized egg,
p28
aVthat round thing with that little blip.
p29
aVIt grows and then it grows,
p30
aVand then it makes this handsome man.
p31
aa(lp32
V(Applause)
p33
aa(lp34
VSo, this guy, with all the cells in his body,
p35
aVall have the same genetic information.
p36
aVSo how did his nose become his nose, his elbow his elbow,
p37
aVand why doesn't he get up one morning
p38
aVand have his nose turn into his foot?
p39
aVIt could. It has the genetic information.
p40
aVYou all remember, dolly,
p41
aVit came from a single mammary cell.
p42
aVSo, why doesn't it do it?
p43
aVSo, have a guess of how many cells he has in his body.
p44
aVSomewhere between 10 trillion to 70 trillion cells in his body.
p45
aVTrillion!
p46
aVNow, how did these cells, all with the same genetic material,
p47
aVmake all those tissues?
p48
aVAnd so, the question I raised before
p49
aVbecomes even more interesting if you thought about
p50
aVthe enormity of this in every one of your bodies.
p51
aa(lp52
VNow, the dominant cancer theory would say
p53
aVthat there is a single oncogene
p54
aVin a single cancer cell, and it would make you
p55
aVa cancer victim.
p56
aVWell, this did not make sense to me.
p57
aVDo you even know how a trillion looks?
p58
aVNow, let's look at it.
p59
aVThere it comes, these zeroes after zeroes after zeroes.
p60
aVNow, if .0001 of these cells got mutated,
p61
aVand .00001 got cancer, you will be a lump of cancer.
p62
aVYou will have cancer all over you. And you're not.
p63
aVWhy not?
p64
aa(lp65
VSo, I decided over the years,
p66
aVbecause of a series of experiments
p67
aVthat this is because of context and architecture.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd let me quickly tell you
p70
aVsome crucial experiment that was able to actually show this.
p71
aVTo begin with, I came to work with this virus
p72
aVthat causes that ugly tumor in the chicken.
p73
aVRous discovered this in 1911.
p74
aVIt was the first cancer virus discovered,
p75
aVand when I call it "oncogene," meaning "cancer gene."
p76
aVSo, he made a filtrate, he took this filter
p77
aVwhich was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter,
p78
aVand he injected it to another chicken, and he got another tumor.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo, scientists were very excited,
p81
aVand they said, a single oncogene can do it.
p82
aVAll you need is a single oncogene.
p83
aVSo, they put the cells in cultures, chicken cells,
p84
aVdumped the virus on it,
p85
aVand it would pile up,
p86
aVand they would say, this is malignant and this is normal.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd again this didn't make sense to me.
p89
aVSo for various reasons, we took this oncogene,
p90
aVattached it to a blue marker,
p91
aVand we injected it into the embryos.
p92
aVNow look at that. There is that beautiful feather in the embryo.
p93
aVEvery one of those blue cells are a cancer gene
p94
aVinside a cancer cell, and they're part of the feather.
p95
aVSo, when we dissociated the feather and put it in a dish,
p96
aVwe got a mass of blue cells.
p97
aVSo, in the chicken you get a tumor,
p98
aVin the embryo you don't,
p99
aVyou dissociate, you put it in a dish, you get another tumor.
p100
aVWhat does that mean?
p101
aVThat means that microenvironment
p102
aVand the context which surrounds those cells
p103
aVactually are telling the cancer gene and the cancer cell what to do.
p104
aa(lp105
VNow, let's take a normal example.
p106
aVThe normal example, let's take the human mammary gland.
p107
aVI work on breast cancer.
p108
aVSo, here is a lovely human breast.
p109
aVAnd many of you know how it looks,
p110
aVexcept that inside that breast, there are all these
p111
aVpretty, developing, tree-like structures.
p112
aVSo, we decided that what we like to do
p113
aVis take just a bit of that mammary gland,
p114
aVwhich is called an "acinus,"
p115
aVwhere there are all these little things inside the breast
p116
aVwhere the milk goes, and the end of the nipple
p117
aVcomes through that little tube when the baby sucks.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd we said, wonderful! Look at this pretty structure.
p120
aVWe want to make this a structure, and ask the question,
p121
aVhow do the cells do that?
p122
aVSo, we took the red cells \u2014
p123
aVyou see the red cells are surrounded by blue,
p124
aVother cells that squeeze them, and behind it
p125
aVis material that people thought was mainly inert,
p126
aVand it was just having a structure to keep the shape,
p127
aVand so we first photographed it
p128
aVwith the electron microscope years and years ago,
p129
aVand you see this cell is actually quite pretty.
p130
aVIt has a bottom, it has a top,
p131
aVit is secreting gobs and gobs of milk,
p132
aVbecause it just came from an early pregnant mouse.
p133
aa(lp134
VYou take these cells, you put them in a dish,
p135
aVand within three days, they look like that.
p136
aVThey completely forget.
p137
aVSo you take them out, you put them in a dish,
p138
aVthey don't make milk. They completely forget.
p139
aVFor example, here is a lovely yellow droplet of milk
p140
aVon the left, there is nothing on the right.
p141
aVLook at the nuclei. The nuclei in the cell on the left
p142
aVis in the animal, the one on the right is in a dish.
p143
aVThey are completely different from each other.
p144
aa(lp145
VSo, what does this tell you?
p146
aVThis tells you that here also, context overrides.
p147
aVIn different contexts, cells do different things.
p148
aVBut how does context signal?
p149
aVSo, Einstein said that
p150
aV"For an idea that does not first seem insane, there is no hope."
p151
aVSo, you can imagine the amount of skepticism
p152
aVI received \u2014 couldn't get money,
p153
aVcouldn't do a whole lot of other things,
p154
aVbut I'm so glad it all worked out.
p155
aa(lp156
VSo, we made a section of the mammary gland of the mouse,
p157
aVand all those lovely acini are there,
p158
aVevery one of those with the red around them are an acinus,
p159
aVand we said okay, we are going to try and make this,
p160
aVand I said, maybe that red stuff
p161
aVaround the acinus that people think there's just a structural scaffold,
p162
aVmaybe it has information,
p163
aVmaybe it tells the cells what to do, maybe it tells the nucleus what to do.
p164
aVSo I said, extracellular matrix, which is this stuff
p165
aVcalled ECM, signals and actually tells the cells what to do.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo, we decided to make things that would look like that.
p168
aVWe found some gooey material
p169
aVthat had the right extracellular matrix in it,
p170
aVwe put the cells in it, and lo and behold,
p171
aVin about four days, they got reorganized
p172
aVand on the right, is what we can make in culture.
p173
aVOn the left is what's inside the animal, we call it in vivo,
p174
aVand the one in culture was full of milk,
p175
aVthe lovely red there is full of milk.
p176
aVSo, we Got Milk, for the American audience.
p177
aVAll right. And here is this beautiful human cell,
p178
aVand you can imagine that here also, context goes.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo, what do we do now?
p181
aVI made a radical hypothesis.
p182
aVI said, if it's true that architecture is dominant,
p183
aVarchitecture restored to a cancer cell
p184
aVshould make the cancer cell think it's normal.
p185
aVCould this be done?
p186
aVSo, we tried it.
p187
aVIn order to do that, however,
p188
aVwe needed to have a method of distinguishing normal from malignant,
p189
aVand on the left is the single normal cell,
p190
aVhuman breast, put in three-dimensional gooey gel
p191
aVthat has extracellular matrix, it makes all these beautiful structures.
p192
aVOn the right, you see it looks very ugly,
p193
aVthe cells continue to grow,
p194
aVthe normal ones stop.
p195
aVAnd you see here in higher magnification
p196
aVthe normal acinus and the ugly tumor.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo we said, what is on the surface of these ugly tumors?
p199
aVCould we calm them down \u2014
p200
aVthey were signaling like crazy and they have pathways all messed up \u2014
p201
aVand make them to the level of the normal?
p202
aVWell, it was wonderful. Boggles my mind.
p203
aVThis is what we got.
p204
aVWe can revert the malignant phenotype.
p205
aa(lp206
V(Applause)
p207
aa(lp208
VAnd in order to show you that the malignant phenotype
p209
aVI didn't just choose one,
p210
aVhere are little movies, sort of fuzzy,
p211
aVbut you see that on the left are the malignant cells,
p212
aVall of them are malignant,
p213
aVwe add one single inhibitor in the beginning,
p214
aVand look what happens, they all look like that.
p215
aVWe inject them into the mouse, the ones on the right,
p216
aVand none of them would make tumors.
p217
aVWe inject the other ones in the mouse, 100 percent tumors.
p218
aa(lp219
VSo, it's a new way of thinking about cancer,
p220
aVit's a hopeful way of thinking about cancer.
p221
aVWe should be able to be dealing with these things at this level,
p222
aVand these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior
p223
aVis regulated at the level of tissue organization
p224
aVand that the tissue organization is dependent
p225
aVon the extracellular matrix and the microenvironment.
p226
aVAll right, thus form and function interact dynamically and reciprocally.
p227
aVAnd here is another five seconds of repose,
p228
aVis my mantra. Form and function.
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd of course, we now ask, where do we go now?
p231
aVWe'd like to take this kind of thinking into the clinic.
p232
aVBut before we do that, I'd like you to think
p233
aVthat at any given time when you're sitting there,
p234
aVin your 70 trillion cells,
p235
aVthe extracellular matrix signaling to your nucleus,
p236
aVthe nucleus is signaling to your extracellular matrix
p237
aVand this is how your balance is kept and restored.
p238
aa(lp239
VWe have made a lot of discoveries,
p240
aVwe have shown that extracellular matrix talks to chromatin.
p241
aVWe have shown that there's little pieces of DNA
p242
aVon the specific genes of the mammary gland
p243
aVthat actually respond to extracellular matrix.
p244
aVIt has taken many years, but it has been very rewarding.
p245
aa(lp246
VAnd before I get to the next slide, I have to tell you
p247
aVthat there are so many additional discoveries to be made.
p248
aVThere is so much mystery we don't know.
p249
aVAnd I always say to the students and post-docs I lecture to,
p250
aVdon't be arrogant, because arrogance kills curiosity.
p251
aVCuriosity and passion.
p252
aVYou need to always think, what else needs to be discovered?
p253
aVAnd maybe my discovery needs to be added to
p254
aVor maybe it needs to be changed.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo, we have now made an amazing discovery,
p257
aVa post-doc in the lab who is a physicist asked me,
p258
aVwhat do the cells do when you put them in?
p259
aVWhat do they do in the beginning when they do?
p260
aVI said, I don't know, we couldn't look at them.
p261
aVWe didn't have high images in the old days.
p262
aVSo she, being an imager and a physicist,
p263
aVdid this incredible thing.
p264
aVThis is a single human breast cell in three dimensions.
p265
aVLook at it. It's constantly doing this.
p266
aVHas a coherent movement.
p267
aVYou put the cancer cells there, and they do go all over,
p268
aVthey do this. They don't do this.
p269
aVAnd when we revert the cancer cell, it again does this.
p270
aVAbsolutely boggles my mind.
p271
aVSo the cell acts like an embryo. What an exciting thing.
p272
aa(lp273
VSo I'd like to finish with a poem.
p274
aVWell I used to love English literature,
p275
aVand I debated in college, which one should I do?
p276
aVAnd unfortunately or fortunately, chemistry won.
p277
aVBut here is a poem from Yeats. I'll just read you the last two lines.
p278
aVIt's called "Among the School Children."
p279
aV"O body swayed to music / O brightening glance /
p280
aVHow [can we know] the dancer from the dance?"
p281
aVAnd here is Merce Cunningham,
p282
aVI was fortunate to dance with him when I was younger,
p283
aVand here he is a dancer,
p284
aVand while he is dancing, he is both the dancer and the dance.
p285
aVThe minute he stops, we have neither.
p286
aVSo it's like form and function.
p287
aa(lp288
VNow, I'd like to show you a current picture of my group.
p289
aVI have been fortunate to have had these magnificant
p290
aVstudents and post-docs who have taught me so much,
p291
aVand I have had many of these groups come and go.
p292
aVThey are the future and I try to make them not be afraid
p293
aVof being the cat and being told,
p294
aVdon't think outside the box.
p295
aa(lp296
VAnd I'd like to leave you with this thought.
p297
aVOn the left is water coming through the shore,
p298
aVtaken from a NASA satellite.
p299
aVOn the right, there is a coral.
p300
aVNow if you take the mammary gland and spread it
p301
aVand take the fat away, on a dish it looks like that.
p302
aVDo they look the same? Do they have the same patterns?
p303
aVWhy is it that nature keeps doing that over and over again?
p304
aa(lp305
VAnd I'd like to submit to you
p306
aVthat we have sequenced the human genome,
p307
aVwe know everything about the sequence of the gene,
p308
aVthe language of the gene, the alphabet of the gene,
p309
aVBut we know nothing, but nothing,
p310
aVabout the language and alphabet of form.
p311
aVSo, it's a wonderful new horizon,
p312
aVit's a wonderful thing to discover for the young
p313
aVand the passionate old, and that's me.
p314
aa(lp315
VSo go to it!
