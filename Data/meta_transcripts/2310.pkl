VToday, I want to talk to you about dreams.
p4
aa(lp5
VI have been a lucid dreamer my whole life,
p6
aVand it's cooler than in the movies.
p7
aV(Laughter)
p8
aVBeyond flying, breathing fire,
p9
aVand making hot men spontaneously appear ...
p10
aV(Laughter)
p11
aVI can do things like read and write music.
p12
aVFun fact is that I wrote my personal statement to college
p13
aVin a dream.
p14
aVAnd I did accepted. So, yeah.
p15
aa(lp16
VI am a very visual thinker.
p17
aVI think in pictures, not words.
p18
aVTo me, words are more like instincts and language.
p19
aa(lp20
VThere are many people like me;
p21
aVNikola Tesla, for example,
p22
aVwho could visualize, design, test, and troubleshoot everything \u2014
p23
aVall of his inventions \u2014 in his mind, accurately.
p24
aa(lp25
VLanguage is kind of exclusive to our species, anyway.
p26
aVI am a bit more primitive,
p27
aVlike a beta version of Google Translate.
p28
aV(Laughter)
p29
aa(lp30
VMy brain has the ability to hyper-focus on things that interest me.
p31
aVFor example, once I had an affair with calculus
p32
aVthat lasted longer than some celebrity marriages.
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VThere are some other unusual things about me.
p36
aVYou may have noticed that I don't have much inflection
p37
aVin my voice.
p38
aVThat's why people often confuse me with a GPS.
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVThis can make basic communication a challenge, unless you need directions.
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aVThank you.
p43
aV(Applause)
p44
aa(lp45
VA few years ago, when I started doing presentations,
p46
aVI went to get head shots done for the first time.
p47
aVThe photographer told me to look flirty.
p48
aV(Laughter)
p49
aVAnd I had no idea what she was talking about.
p50
aV(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VShe said, "Do that thing, you know, with your eyes,
p53
aVwhen you're flirting with guys."
p54
aa(lp55
V"What thing?" I asked.
p56
aa(lp57
V"You know, squint."
p58
aa(lp59
VAnd so I tried, really.
p60
aVIt looked something like this.
p61
aV(Laughter)
p62
aVI looked like I was searching for Waldo.
p63
aV(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VThere's a reason for this,
p66
aVas there is a reason that Waldo is hiding.
p67
aV(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VI have Asperger's,
p70
aVa high-functioning form of autism
p71
aVthat impairs the basic social skills one is expected to display.
p72
aVIt's made life difficult in many ways,
p73
aVand growing up, I struggled to fit in socially.
p74
aVMy friends would tell jokes, but I didn't understand them.
p75
aVMy personal heroes were George Carlin and Stephen Colbert \u2014
p76
aVand they taught me humor.
p77
aVMy personality switched from being shy and awkward
p78
aVto being defiant and cursing out a storm.
p79
aVNeedless to say, I did not have many friends.
p80
aVI was also hypersensitive to texture.
p81
aVThe feel of water on my skin was like pins and needles,
p82
aVand so for years, I refused to shower.
p83
aVI can assure you that my hygiene routine is up to standards now, though.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VI had to do a lot to get here, and my parents \u2014
p87
aVthings kind of got out of control when I was sexually assaulted by a peer,
p88
aVand on top of everything, it made a difficult situation worse.
p89
aVAnd I had to travel 2,000 miles across the country to get treatment,
p90
aVbut within days of them prescribing a new medication,
p91
aVmy life turned into an episode of the Walking Dead.
p92
aVI became paranoid, and began to hallucinate
p93
aVthat rotting corpses were coming towards me.
p94
aVMy family finally rescued me,
p95
aVbut by that time, I had lost 19 pounds in those three weeks,
p96
aVas well as developing severe anemia,
p97
aVand was on the verge of suicide.
p98
aa(lp99
VI transferred to a new treatment center that understood my aversions,
p100
aVmy trauma, and my social anxiety,
p101
aVand they knew how to treat it, and I got the help I finally needed.
p102
aVAnd after 18 months of hard work,
p103
aVI went on to do incredible things.
p104
aa(lp105
VOne of the things with Asperger's is that oftentimes,
p106
aVthese people have a very complex inner life,
p107
aVand I know for myself, I have a very colorful personality,
p108
aVrich ideas, and just a lot going on in my mind.
p109
aVBut there's a gap between where that stands,
p110
aVand how I communicate it with the rest of the world.
p111
aVAnd this can make basic communication a challenge.
p112
aa(lp113
VNot many places would hire me, due to my lack of social skills,
p114
aVwhich is why I applied to Waffle House.
p115
aV(Laughter)
p116
aVWaffle House is an exceptional 24-hour diner \u2014
p117
aV(Laughter)
p118
aV(Applause)
p119
aVthank you \u2014
p120
aVwhere you can order your hash browns
p121
aVthe many ways that someone would dispose of a human corpse ...
p122
aV(Laughter)
p123
aVSliced, diced, peppered, chunked, topped, capped, and covered.
p124
aV(Laughter)
p125
aVAs social norms would have it,
p126
aVyou should only go to Waffle House at an ungodly hour in the night.
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aVSo one time, at 2 am, I was chatting with a waitress, and I asked her,
p129
aV"What's the most ridiculous thing that's happened to you on the job?"
p130
aVAnd she told me that one time, a man walked in completely naked.
p131
aV(Laughter)
p132
aVI said, "Great! Sign me up for the graveyard shift!"
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aVNeedless to say, Waffle House did not hire me.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo in terms of having Asperger's, it can be viewed as a disadvantage,
p137
aVand sometimes it is a real pain in the butt,
p138
aVbut it's also the opposite.
p139
aVIt's a gift, and it allows me to think innovatively.
p140
aVAt 19, I won a research competition for my research on coral reefs,
p141
aVand I ended up speaking
p142
aVat the UN Convention of Biological Diversity,
p143
aVpresenting this research.
p144
aV(Applause)
p145
aVThank you.
p146
aV(Applause)
p147
aVAnd at 22, I'm getting ready to graduate college,
p148
aVand I am a co-founder of a biotech company called AutismSees.
p149
aV(Applause)
p150
aVThank you.
p151
aV(Applause)
p152
aa(lp153
VBut consider what I had to do to get here:
p154
aV25 therapists, 11 misdiagnoses, and years of pain and trauma.
p155
aVI spent a lot of time thinking if there's a better way,
p156
aVand I think there is: autism-assistive technology.
p157
aVThis technology could play an integral role
p158
aVin helping people with autistic spectrum disorder,
p159
aVor ASD.
p160
aa(lp161
VThe app Podium, released by my company, AutismSees,
p162
aVhas the ability to independently assess and help develop communication skills.
p163
aVIn addition to this, it tracks eye contact through camera
p164
aVand simulates a public-speaking and job-interview experience.
p165
aVAnd so maybe one day, Waffle House will hire me,
p166
aVafter practicing on it some more.
p167
aV(Laughter)
p168
aVAnd one of the great things is that I've used Podium
p169
aVto help me prepare for today, and it's been a great help.
p170
aVBut it's more than that.
p171
aVThere's more that can be done.
p172
aVFor people with ASD \u2014
p173
aVit has been speculated that many innovative scientists,
p174
aVresearchers, artists, and engineers have it;
p175
aVlike, for example, Emily Dickinson, Jane Austen, Isaac Newton, and Bill Gates
p176
aVare some examples.
p177
aVBut the problem that's encountered
p178
aVis that these brilliant ideas often can't be shared
p179
aVif there are communication roadblocks.
p180
aVAnd so, many people with autism are being overlooked every day,
p181
aVand they're being taken advantage of.
p182
aVSo my dream for people with autism is to change that,
p183
aVto remove the roadblocks that prevent them from succeeding.
p184
aa(lp185
VOne of the reasons I love lucid dreaming
p186
aVis because it allows me to be free,
p187
aVwithout judgment of social and physical consequences.
p188
aVWhen I'm flying over scenes that I create in my mind,
p189
aVI am at peace.
p190
aVI am free from judgment,
p191
aVand so I can do whatever I want, you know?
p192
aVI'm making out with Brad Pitt, and Angelina is totally cool with it.
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VBut the goal of autism-assistive technology is bigger than that,
p196
aVand more important.
p197
aVMy goal is to shift people's perspective
p198
aVof autism and people with higher-functioning Asperger's
p199
aVbecause there is a lot they can do.
p200
aVI mean, look at Temple Grandin, for example.
p201
aVAnd by doing so, we allow people to share their talents with this world
p202
aVand move this world forward.
p203
aVIn addition, we give them the courage to pursue their dreams
p204
aVin the real world, in real time.
p205
aa(lp206
VThank you.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Applause)
p209
aa(lp210
VThank you.
