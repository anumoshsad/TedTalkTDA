VI work with a species called "Bonobo."
p4
aVAnd I'm happy most of the time,
p5
aVbecause I think this is the happiest species on the planet.
p6
aVIt's kind of a well-kept secret.
p7
aVThis species lives only in the Congo.
p8
aVAnd they're not in too many zoos, because of their sexual behavior.
p9
aVTheir sexual behavior is too human-like
p10
aVfor most of us to be comfortable with.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VBut \u2014
p15
aa(lp16
V(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
Vactually, we have a lot to learn from them, because they're a very
p19
aVegalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society.
p20
aVAnd sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life
p21
aVthat they sort of set aside.
p22
aVIt permeates their entire life.
p23
aVAnd it's used for communication.
p24
aVAnd it's used for conflict resolution.
p25
aVAnd I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of,
p26
aVdivided our lives up into lots of parts.
p27
aVWe divided our world up with lots of categories.
p28
aVAnd so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit.
p29
aVBut I don't think that we were that way initially.
p30
aa(lp31
VThere are many people who think that the animal world is hard-wired
p32
aVand that there's something very, very special about man.
p33
aVMaybe it's his ability to have causal thought.
p34
aVMaybe it's something special in his brain
p35
aVthat allows him to have language.
p36
aVMaybe it's something special in his brain
p37
aVthat allows him to make tools or to have mathematics.
p38
aVWell, I don't know. There were Tasmanians who were discovered
p39
aVaround the 1600s and they had no fire.
p40
aVThey had no stone tools.
p41
aVTo our knowledge they had no music.
p42
aVSo when you compare them to the Bonobo,
p43
aVthe Bonobo is a little hairier.
p44
aVHe doesn't stand quite as upright.
p45
aVBut there are a lot of similarities.
p46
aVAnd I think that as we look at culture,
p47
aVwe kind of come to understand
p48
aVhow we got to where we are.
p49
aVAnd I don't really think it's in our biology;
p50
aVI think we've attributed it to our biology,
p51
aVbut I don't really think it's there.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo what I want to do now is introduce you
p54
aVto a species called the Bonobo.
p55
aVThis is Kanzi.
p56
aVHe's a Bonobo.
p57
aVRight now, he's in a forest in Georgia.
p58
aVHis mother originally came from a forest in Africa.
p59
aVAnd she came to us when she was just at puberty,
p60
aVabout six or seven years of age.
p61
aa(lp62
VNow this shows a Bonobo on your right,
p63
aVand a chimpanzee on your left.
p64
aVClearly, the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking.
p65
aVThe Bonobo, although shorter than us and their arms still longer,
p66
aVis more upright, just as we are.
p67
aVThis shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy.
p68
aVAs you can see, there's not a lot of difference
p69
aVbetween the way a Bonobo walks
p70
aVand the way an early australopithecine would have walked.
p71
aVAs they turn toward us you'll see
p72
aVthat the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter
p73
aVand doesn't have to rotate quite so much from side to side.
p74
aVSo the \u2014 the bipedal gait is a little easier.
p75
aVAnd now we see all four.
p76
aa(lp77
VVideo: Narrator: The wild Bonobo lives in central Africa, in the jungle
p78
aVencircled by the Congo River.
p79
aVCanopied trees as tall as 40 meters, 130 feet,
p80
aVgrow densely in the area.
p81
aVIt was a Japanese scientist
p82
aVwho first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo,
p83
aValmost three decades ago.
p84
aVBonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee.
p85
aVSlim-bodied, Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures.
p86
aVLong and careful studies have reported many new findings on them.
p87
aVOne discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally.
p88
aVWhat's more, they are able to walk upright for long distances.
p89
aVSusan Savage-Rumbaugh (video): Let's go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame.
p90
aa(lp91
VSS: This is Kanzi and I, in the forest.
p92
aVNone of the things you will see in this particular video are trained.
p93
aVNone of them are tricks.
p94
aVThey all happened to be captured on film spontaneously,
p95
aVby NHK of Japan.
p96
aVWe have eight Bonobos.
p97
aa(lp98
VVideo: Look at all this stuff that's here for our campfire.
p99
aa(lp100
VSS: An entire family at our research centre.
p101
aa(lp102
VVideo: You going to help get some sticks?
p103
aVGood.
p104
aVWe need more sticks, too.
p105
aVI have a lighter in my pocket if you need one.
p106
aVThat's a wasps' nest.
p107
aVYou can get it out.
p108
aVI hope I have a lighter.
p109
aVYou can use the lighter to start the fire.
p110
aa(lp111
VSS: So Kanzi is very interested in fire.
p112
aVHe doesn't do it yet without a lighter,
p113
aVbut I think if he saw someone do it, he might be able to do \u2014
p114
aVmake a fire without a lighter.
p115
aVHe's learning about how to keep a fire going.
p116
aVHe's learning the uses for a fire,
p117
aVjust by watching what we do with fire.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VThis is a smile on the face of a Bonobo.
p122
aVThese are happy vocalizations.
p123
aa(lp124
VVideo: You're happy.
p125
aVYou're very happy about this part.
p126
aVYou've got to put some water on the fire. You see the water?
p127
aVGood job.
p128
aa(lp129
VSS: Forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack.
p130
aVBut he likes to carry things from place to place.
p131
aa(lp132
VVideo: Austin, I hear you saying "Austin."
p133
aa(lp134
VSS: He talks to other Bonobos at the lab, long-distance,
p135
aVfarther than we can hear.
p136
aVThis is his sister.
p137
aVThis is her first time to try to drive a golf cart.
p138
aa(lp139
VVideo: Goodbye.
p140
aa(lp141
V(Laughter)
p142
aa(lp143
VSS: She's got the pedals down, but not the wheel.
p144
aVShe switches from reverse to forward
p145
aVand she holds onto the wheel, rather than turns it.
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VLike us, she knows that that individual in the mirror is her.
p150
aa(lp151
V(Music)
p152
aa(lp153
VVideo: Narrator: By raising Bonobos in a culture that is both Bonobo and human,
p154
aVand documenting their development across two decades,
p155
aVscientists are exploring how cultural forces
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
Vmay have operated during human evolution.
p160
aa(lp161
VHis name is Nyota.
p162
aVIt means "star" in Swahili.
p163
aa(lp164
V(Music)
p165
aa(lp166
VPanbanisha is trying to give Nyota a haircut with a pair of scissors.
p167
aVIn the wild, the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring.
p168
aVHere Panbanisha uses scissors, instead of her hands,
p169
aVto groom Nyota.
p170
aVVery impressive.
p171
aVSubtle maneuvering of the hands is required
p172
aVto perform delicate tasks like this.
p173
aVNyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself.
p174
aVRealizing that Nyota might get hurt,
p175
aVPanbanisha, like any human mother,
p176
aVcarefully tugs to get the scissors back.
p177
aa(lp178
VHe can now cut through tough animal hide.
p179
aa(lp180
VSS: Kanzi's learned to make stone tools.
p181
aa(lp182
VVideo: Kanzi now makes his tools,
p183
aVjust as our ancestors may have made them,
p184
aVtwo-and-a-half million years ago \u2014
p185
aVby holding the rocks in both hands, to strike one against the other.
p186
aVHe has learned that by using both hands
p187
aVand aiming his glancing blows,
p188
aVhe can make much larger, sharper flakes.
p189
aVKanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough.
p190
aVThe tough hide is difficult to cut, even with a knife.
p191
aVThe rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard
p192
aVand ideal for stone tool making, but difficult to handle,
p193
aVrequiring great skill.
p194
aVKanzi's rock is from Gona, Ethiopia
p195
aVand is identical to that used by our African ancestors
p196
aVtwo-and-a-half million years ago.
p197
aVThese are the rocks Kanzi used
p198
aVand these are the flakes he made.
p199
aVThe flat sharp edges are like knife blades.
p200
aVCompare them to the tools our ancestors used;
p201
aVthey bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi's.
p202
aa(lp203
VPanbanisha is longing to go for a walk in the woods.
p204
aVShe keeps staring out the window.
p205
aa(lp206
VSS: This is \u2014 let me show you something we didn't think they would do.
p207
aa(lp208
VVideo: For several days now, Panbanisha has not been outside.
p209
aa(lp210
VSS: I normally talk about language.
p211
aa(lp212
VVideo: Then Panbanisha does something unexpected.
p213
aa(lp214
VSS: But since I'm advised not to do what I normally do,
p215
aVI haven't told you that these apes have language.
p216
aVIt's a geometric language.
p217
aa(lp218
VVideo: She takes a piece of chalk
p219
aVand begins writing something on the floor.
p220
aVWhat is she writing?
p221
aa(lp222
VSS: She's also saying the name of that, with her voice.
p223
aa(lp224
VVideo: Now she comes up to Dr. Sue and starts writing again.
p225
aa(lp226
VSS: These are her symbols on her keyboard.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Music)
p229
aa(lp230
VThey speak when she touches them.
p231
aa(lp232
VVideo: Panbanisha is communicating to Dr. Sue where she wants to go.
p233
aV"A frame" represents a hut in the woods.
p234
aVCompare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard.
p235
aVPanbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor.
p236
aVSS (video): Very nice. Beautiful, Panbanisha.
p237
aa(lp238
VSS: At first we didn't really realize what she was doing,
p239
aVuntil we stood back and looked at it and rotated it.
p240
aa(lp241
VVideo: This lexigram also refers to a place in the woods.
p242
aVThe curved line is very similar to the lexigram.
p243
aVThe next symbol Panbanisha writes represents "collar."
p244
aVIt indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out.
p245
aa(lp246
VSS: That's an institutional requirement.
p247
aa(lp248
VVideo: This symbol is not as clear as the others,
p249
aVbut one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line
p250
aVand several straight lines.
p251
aVResearchers began to record what Panbanisha said,
p252
aVby writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk.
p253
aVPanbanisha watched.
p254
aVSoon she began to write as well.
p255
aVThe Bonobo's abilities have stunned scientists around the world.
p256
aVHow did they develop?
p257
aa(lp258
VSS (video): We found that the most important thing
p259
aVfor permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them.
p260
aVIt's simply to use language around them,
p261
aVbecause the driving force in language acquisition
p262
aVis to understand what others, that are important to you, are saying to you.
p263
aVOnce you have that capacity,
p264
aVthe ability to produce language
p265
aVcomes rather naturally and rather freely.
p266
aVSo we want to create an environment in which Bonobos,
p267
aVlike all of the individuals with whom they are interacting \u2014
p268
aVwe want to create an environment in which they have fun,
p269
aVand an environment in which the others
p270
aVare meaningful individuals for them.
p271
aVNarrator: This environment brings out unexpected potential
p272
aVin Kanzi and Panbanisha.
p273
aa(lp274
VPanbanisha is enjoying playing her harmonica,
p275
aVuntil Nyota, now one year old, steals it.
p276
aVThen he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth.
p277
aVIs he looking for where the sound came from?
p278
aVDr. Sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity to flourish.
p279
aVThis time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano.
p280
aVShe wasn't forced to learn the piano;
p281
aVshe saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest.
p282
aa(lp283
VResearcher: Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm listening.
p284
aVDo that real fast part that you did. Yeah, that part.
p285
aa(lp286
VNarrator: Kanzi plays the xylophone;
p287
aVusing both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr. Sue's singing.
p288
aVKanzi and Panbanisha
p289
aVare stimulated by this fun-filled environment,
p290
aVwhich promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities.
p291
aa(lp292
V(Laughter)
p293
aa(lp294
VResearcher: OK, now get the monsters. Get them.
p295
aVTake the cherries too.
p296
aVNow watch out, stay away from them now.
p297
aVNow you can chase them again. Time to chase them.
p298
aVNow you have to stay away. Get away.
p299
aVRun away. Run.
p300
aVNow we can chase them again. Go get them.
p301
aVOh no!
p302
aVGood Kanzi. Very good. Thank you so much.
p303
aa(lp304
VNarrator: None of us, Bonobo or human, can possibly even imagine?
p305
aa(lp306
VSS: So we have a bi-species environment, we call it a "panhomoculture."
p307
aVWe're learning how to become like them.
p308
aVWe're learning how to communicate with them,
p309
aVin really high-pitched tones.
p310
aVWe're learning that they probably have a language in the wild.
p311
aVAnd they're learning to become like us.
p312
aVBecause we believe that it's not biology; it's culture.
p313
aVSo we're sharing tools and technology and language
p314
aVwith another species.
p315
aa(lp316
VThank you.
