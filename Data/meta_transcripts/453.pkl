VI am a writer.
p4
aVWriting books is my profession but it's more than that, of course.
p5
aVIt is also my great lifelong love and fascination.
p6
aVAnd I don't expect that that's ever going to change.
p7
aVBut, that said, something kind of peculiar has happened recently
p8
aVin my life and in my career,
p9
aVwhich has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work.
p10
aVAnd the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book,
p11
aVthis memoir called "Eat, Pray, Love"
p12
aVwhich, decidedly unlike any of my previous books,
p13
aVwent out in the world for some reason, and became this big,
p14
aVmega-sensation, international bestseller thing.
p15
aVThe result of which is that everywhere I go now,
p16
aVpeople treat me like I'm doomed.
p17
aVSeriously \u2014 doomed, doomed!
p18
aVLike, they come up to me now, all worried, and they say,
p19
aV"Aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that?
p20
aVAren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life
p21
aVand you're never again going to create a book
p22
aVthat anybody in the world cares about at all,
p23
aVever again?"
p24
aa(lp25
VSo that's reassuring, you know.
p26
aVBut it would be worse, except for that I happen to remember
p27
aVthat over 20 years ago, when I was a teenager,
p28
aVwhen I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writer,
p29
aVI was met with this same sort of fear-based reaction.
p30
aVAnd people would say, "Aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success?
p31
aVAren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you?
p32
aVAren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft
p33
aVand nothing's ever going to come of it
p34
aVand you're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams
p35
aVwith your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure?"
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VLike that, you know.
p40
aa(lp41
VThe answer \u2014 the short answer to all those questions is, "Yes."
p42
aVYes, I'm afraid of all those things.
p43
aVAnd I always have been.
p44
aVAnd I'm afraid of many, many more things besides
p45
aVthat people can't even guess at,
p46
aVlike seaweed and other things that are scary.
p47
aVBut, when it comes to writing,
p48
aVthe thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately, and wondering about lately,
p49
aVis why?
p50
aVYou know, is it rational?
p51
aVIs it logical that anybody should be expected
p52
aVto be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do.
p53
aVAnd what is it specifically about creative ventures
p54
aVthat seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health
p55
aVin a way that other careers kind of don't do, you know?
p56
aVLike my dad, for example, was a chemical engineer
p57
aVand I don't recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering
p58
aVanybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer, you know?
p59
aV"That chemical-engineering block, John, how's it going?"
p60
aVIt just didn't come up like that, you know?
p61
aVBut to be fair, chemical engineers as a group
p62
aVhaven't really earned a reputation over the centuries
p63
aVfor being alcoholic manic-depressives.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Laughter)
p66
aa(lp67
VWe writers, we kind of do have that reputation,
p68
aVand not just writers, but creative people across all genres,
p69
aVit seems, have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable.
p70
aVAnd all you have to do is look at the very grim death count
p71
aVin the 20th century alone, of really magnificent creative minds
p72
aVwho died young and often at their own hands, you know?
p73
aVAnd even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide
p74
aVseem to be really undone by their gifts, you know.
p75
aVNorman Mailer, just before he died, last interview, he said,
p76
aV"Every one of my books has killed me a little more."
p77
aVAn extraordinary statement to make about your life's work.
p78
aVBut we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this,
p79
aVbecause we've heard that kind of stuff for so long
p80
aVand somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively
p81
aVthis notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked
p82
aVand that artistry, in the end, will always ultimately lead to anguish.
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd the question that I want to ask everybody here today
p85
aVis are you guys all cool with that idea?
p86
aVAre you comfortable with that?
p87
aVBecause you look at it even from an inch away and, you know \u2014
p88
aVI'm not at all comfortable with that assumption.
p89
aVI think it's odious.
p90
aVAnd I also think it's dangerous,
p91
aVand I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century.
p92
aVI think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live.
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd I definitely know that, in my case \u2014 in my situation \u2014
p95
aVit would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path
p96
aVof assumption,
p97
aVparticularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career.
p98
aVWhich is \u2014 you know, like check it out,
p99
aVI'm pretty young, I'm only about 40 years old.
p100
aVI still have maybe another four decades of work left in me.
p101
aVAnd it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward
p102
aVis going to be judged by the world as the work that came after
p103
aVthe freakish success of my last book, right?
p104
aVI should just put it bluntly, because we're all sort of friends here now \u2014
p105
aVit's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me.
p106
aVSo Jesus, what a thought!
p107
aVThat's the kind of thought that could lead a person
p108
aVto start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning,
p109
aVand I don't want to go there.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VI would prefer to keep doing this work that I love.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd so, the question becomes, how?
p116
aVAnd so, it seems to me, upon a lot of reflection,
p117
aVthat the way that I have to work now, in order to continue writing,
p118
aVis that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct, right?
p119
aVI have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance
p120
aVbetween me, as I am writing, and my very natural anxiety
p121
aVabout what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on.
p122
aVAnd, as I've been looking, over the last year,
p123
aVfor models for how to do that,
p124
aVI've been sort of looking across time,
p125
aVand I've been trying to find other societies
p126
aVto see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have
p127
aVabout how to help creative people
p128
aVsort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity.
p129
aa(lp130
VAnd that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.
p131
aVSo stay with me, because it does circle around and back.
p132
aVBut, ancient Greece and ancient Rome \u2014
p133
aVpeople did not happen to believe that creativity
p134
aVcame from human beings back then, OK?
p135
aVPeople believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit
p136
aVthat came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source,
p137
aVfor distant and unknowable reasons.
p138
aVThe Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity "daemons."
p139
aVSocrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon
p140
aVwho spoke wisdom to him from afar.
p141
aa(lp142
VThe Romans had the same idea,
p143
aVbut they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius.
p144
aVWhich is great, because the Romans did not actually think
p145
aVthat a genius was a particularly clever individual.
p146
aVThey believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity,
p147
aVwho was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio,
p148
aVkind of like Dobby the house elf,
p149
aVand who would come out
p150
aVand sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work
p151
aVand would shape the outcome of that work.
p152
aa(lp153
VSo brilliant \u2014 there it is, right there, that distance that I'm talking about \u2014
p154
aVthat psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work.
p155
aVAnd everyone knew that this is how it functioned, right?
p156
aVSo the ancient artist was protected from certain things,
p157
aVlike, for example, too much narcissism, right?
p158
aVIf your work was brilliant, you couldn't take all the credit for it,
p159
aVeverybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you.
p160
aVIf your work bombed, not entirely your fault, you know?
p161
aVEveryone knew your genius was kind of lame.
p162
aa(lp163
V(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
VAnd this is how people thought about creativity in the West
p166
aVfor a really long time.
p167
aVAnd then the Renaissance came and everything changed,
p168
aVand we had this big idea, and the big idea was,
p169
aVlet's put the individual human being at the center of the universe
p170
aVabove all gods and mysteries,
p171
aVand there's no more room for mystical creatures
p172
aVwho take dictation from the divine.
p173
aVAnd it's the beginning of rational humanism,
p174
aVand people started to believe that creativity
p175
aVcame completely from the self of the individual.
p176
aVAnd for the first time in history,
p177
aVyou start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius,
p178
aVrather than having a genius.
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd I got to tell you, I think that was a huge error.
p181
aVYou know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person
p182
aVto believe that he or she is like, the vessel,
p183
aVyou know, like the font and the essence and the source
p184
aVof all divine, creative, unknowable, eternal mystery
p185
aVis just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile, human psyche.
p186
aVIt's like asking somebody to swallow the sun.
p187
aVIt just completely warps and distorts egos,
p188
aVand it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance.
p189
aVAnd I think the pressure of that
p190
aVhas been killing off our artists for the last 500 years.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd, if this is true,
p193
aVand I think it is true,
p194
aVthe question becomes, what now?
p195
aVCan we do this differently?
p196
aVMaybe go back to some more ancient understanding
p197
aVabout the relationship between humans and the creative mystery.
p198
aVMaybe not.
p199
aVMaybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought
p200
aVin one 18 minute speech.
p201
aVAnd there's probably people in this audience
p202
aVwho would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions
p203
aVabout the notion of, basically, fairies
p204
aVwho follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff.
p205
aVI'm not, probably, going to bring you all along with me on this.
p206
aa(lp207
VBut the question that I kind of want to pose is \u2014
p208
aVyou know, why not?
p209
aVWhy not think about it this way?
p210
aVBecause it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard
p211
aVin terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness
p212
aVof the creative process.
p213
aVA process which, as anybody who has ever tried to make something \u2014
p214
aVwhich is to say basically everyone here \u2014-
p215
aVknows does not always behave rationally.
p216
aVAnd, in fact, can sometimes feel downright paranormal.
p217
aa(lp218
VI had this encounter recently
p219
aVwhere I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone,
p220
aVwho's now in her 90s, but she's been a poet her entire life
p221
aVand she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia,
p222
aVshe would be out working in the fields,
p223
aVand she said she would feel and hear a poem
p224
aVcoming at her from over the landscape.
p225
aVAnd she said it was like a thunderous train of air.
p226
aVAnd it would come barreling down at her over the landscape.
p227
aVAnd she felt it coming, because it would shake the earth under her feet.
p228
aVShe knew that she had only one thing to do at that point,
p229
aVand that was to, in her words, "run like hell."
p230
aVAnd she would run like hell to the house
p231
aVand she would be getting chased by this poem,
p232
aVand the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil
p233
aVfast enough so that when it thundered through her, she could collect it
p234
aVand grab it on the page.
p235
aVAnd other times she wouldn't be fast enough,
p236
aVso she'd be running and running, and she wouldn't get to the house
p237
aVand the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it
p238
aVand she said it would continue on across the landscape,
p239
aVlooking, as she put it "for another poet."
p240
aVAnd then there were these times \u2014
p241
aVthis is the piece I never forgot \u2014
p242
aVshe said that there were moments where she would almost miss it, right?
p243
aVSo, she's running to the house and she's looking for the paper
p244
aVand the poem passes through her,
p245
aVand she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her,
p246
aVand then she said, it was like she would reach out with her other hand
p247
aVand she would catch it.
p248
aVShe would catch the poem by its tail,
p249
aVand she would pull it backwards into her body
p250
aVas she was transcribing on the page.
p251
aVAnd in these instances, the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact
p252
aVbut backwards, from the last word to the first.
p253
aa(lp254
V(Laughter)
p255
aa(lp256
VSo when I heard that I was like \u2014 that's uncanny,
p257
aVthat's exactly what my creative process is like.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VThat's not at all what my creative process is \u2014 I'm not the pipeline!
p262
aVI'm a mule, and the way that I have to work
p263
aVis I have to get up at the same time every day,
p264
aVand sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly.
p265
aVBut even I, in my mulishness,
p266
aVeven I have brushed up against that thing, at times.
p267
aVAnd I would imagine that a lot of you have too.
p268
aVYou know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source
p269
aVthat I honestly cannot identify.
p270
aVAnd what is that thing?
p271
aVAnd how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds,
p272
aVbut, in fact, might actually keep us sane?
p273
aa(lp274
VAnd for me, the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that
p275
aVis the musician Tom Waits,
p276
aVwho I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment.
p277
aVAnd we were talking about this,
p278
aVand you know, Tom, for most of his life, he was pretty much the embodiment
p279
aVof the tormented contemporary modern artist,
p280
aVtrying to control and manage and dominate
p281
aVthese sort of uncontrollable creative impulses
p282
aVthat were totally internalized.
p283
aa(lp284
VBut then he got older, he got calmer,
p285
aVand one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles,
p286
aVand this is when it all changed for him.
p287
aVAnd he's speeding along, and all of a sudden
p288
aVhe hears this little fragment of melody,
p289
aVthat comes into his head as inspiration often comes, elusive and tantalizing,
p290
aVand he wants it, it's gorgeous,
p291
aVand he longs for it, but he has no way to get it.
p292
aVHe doesn't have a piece of paper, or a pencil, or a tape recorder.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him
p295
aVlike, "I'm going to lose this thing,
p296
aVand I'll be be haunted by this song forever.
p297
aVI'm not good enough, and I can't do it."
p298
aVAnd instead of panicking, he just stopped.
p299
aVHe just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel.
p300
aVHe just looked up at the sky, and he said,
p301
aV"Excuse me, can you not see that I'm driving?"
p302
aa(lp303
V(Laughter)
p304
aa(lp305
V"Do I look like I can write down a song right now?
p306
aVIf you really want to exist, come back at a more opportune moment
p307
aVwhen I can take care of you.
p308
aVOtherwise, go bother somebody else today.
p309
aVGo bother Leonard Cohen."
p310
aa(lp311
VAnd his whole work process changed after that.
p312
aVNot the work, the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever.
p313
aVBut the process, and the heavy anxiety around it
p314
aVwas released when he took the genie, the genius out of him
p315
aVwhere it was causing nothing but trouble, and released it back where it came from,
p316
aVand realized that this didn't have to be this internalized, tormented thing.
p317
aVIt could be this peculiar, wondrous, bizarre collaboration,
p318
aVkind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing
p319
aVthat was not quite Tom.
p320
aa(lp321
VWhen I heard that story, it started to shift a little bit
p322
aVthe way that I worked too, and this idea already saved me once.
p323
aVIt saved me when I was in the middle of writing "Eat, Pray, Love,"
p324
aVand I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair
p325
aVthat we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming
p326
aVand you start to think this is going to be a disaster, the worst book ever written.
p327
aVNot just bad, but the worst book ever written.
p328
aVAnd I started to think I should just dump this project.
p329
aVBut then I remembered Tom talking to the open air
p330
aVand I tried it.
p331
aVSo I just lifted my face up from the manuscript
p332
aVand I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room.
p333
aVAnd I said aloud, "Listen you, thing,
p334
aVyou and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant
p335
aVthat is not entirely my fault, right?
p336
aVBecause you can see that I am putting everything I have into this,
p337
aVI don't have any more than this.
p338
aVIf you want it to be better, you've got to show up and do your part of the deal.
p339
aVBut if you don't do that, you know what, the hell with it.
p340
aVI'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job.
p341
aVAnd I would please like the record to reflect today
p342
aVthat I showed up for my part of the job."
p343
aa(lp344
V(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
VBecause \u2014
p347
aa(lp348
V(Applause)
p349
aa(lp350
VBecause in the end it's like this, OK \u2014
p351
aVcenturies ago in the deserts of North Africa,
p352
aVpeople used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music
p353
aVthat would go on for hours and hours, until dawn.
p354
aVThey were always magnificent, because the dancers were professionals
p355
aVand they were terrific, right?
p356
aVBut every once in a while, very rarely, something would happen,
p357
aVand one of these performers would actually become transcendent.
p358
aVAnd I know you know what I'm talking about,
p359
aVbecause I know you've all seen, at some point in your life,
p360
aVa performance like this.
p361
aVIt was like time would stop,
p362
aVand the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal
p363
aVand he wasn't doing anything different
p364
aVthan he had ever done, 1,000 nights before,
p365
aVbut everything would align.
p366
aVAnd all of a sudden, he would no longer appear to be merely human.
p367
aVHe would be lit from within, and lit from below
p368
aVand all lit up on fire with divinity.
p369
aa(lp370
VAnd when this happened, back then,
p371
aVpeople knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its name.
p372
aVThey would put their hands together and they would start to chant,
p373
aV"Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God."
p374
aVThat's God, you know.
p375
aVCurious historical footnote:
p376
aVwhen the Moors invaded southern Spain, they took this custom with them
p377
aVand the pronunciation changed over the centuries
p378
aVfrom "Allah, Allah, Allah," to "Olé, olé, olé,"
p379
aVwhich you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances.
p380
aVIn Spain, when a performer has done something impossible and magic,
p381
aV"Allah, olé, olé, Allah, magnificent, bravo,"
p382
aVincomprehensible, there it is \u2014 a glimpse of God.
p383
aVWhich is great, because we need that.
p384
aa(lp385
VBut, the tricky bit comes the next morning,
p386
aVfor the dancer himself, when he wakes up and discovers
p387
aVthat it's Tuesday at 11 a.m., and he's no longer a glimpse of God.
p388
aVHe's just an aging mortal with really bad knees,
p389
aVand maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again.
p390
aVAnd maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins,
p391
aVand what is he then to do with the rest of his life?
p392
aVThis is hard.
p393
aVThis is one of the most painful reconciliations to make
p394
aVin a creative life.
p395
aVBut maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish
p396
aVif you never happened to believe, in the first place,
p397
aVthat the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you.
p398
aVBut maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you
p399
aVfrom some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life
p400
aVto be passed along when you're finished,
p401
aVwith somebody else.
p402
aVAnd, you know, if we think about it this way, it starts to change everything.
p403
aa(lp404
VThis is how I've started to think,
p405
aVand this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months
p406
aVas I've been working on the book that will soon be published,
p407
aVas the dangerously, frighteningly over-anticipated follow up
p408
aVto my freakish success.
p409
aa(lp410
VAnd what I have to sort of keep telling myself
p411
aVwhen I get really psyched out about that is don't be afraid.
p412
aVDon't be daunted. Just do your job.
p413
aVContinue to show up for your piece of it, whatever that might be.
p414
aVIf your job is to dance, do your dance.
p415
