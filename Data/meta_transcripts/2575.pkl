VThe conventional wisdom about our world today
p4
aVis that this is a time of terrible decline.
p5
aVAnd that's not surprising, given the bad news all around us,
p6
aVfrom ISIS to inequality,
p7
aVpolitical dysfunction, climate change,
p8
aVBrexit, and on and on.
p9
aVBut here's the thing, and this may sound a little weird.
p10
aVI actually don't buy this gloomy narrative,
p11
aVand I don't think you should either.
p12
aVLook, it's not that I don't see the problems.
p13
aVI read the same headlines that you do.
p14
aVWhat I dispute is the conclusion that so many people draw from them,
p15
aVnamely that we're all screwed
p16
aVbecause the problems are unsolvable
p17
aVand our governments are useless.
p18
aa(lp19
VNow, why do I say this?
p20
aVIt's not like I'm particularly optimistic by nature.
p21
aVBut something about the media's constant doom-mongering
p22
aVwith its fixation on problems and not on answers
p23
aVhas always really bugged me.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo a few years ago I decided,
p26
aVwell, I'm a journalist,
p27
aVI should see if I can do any better
p28
aVby going around the world and actually asking folks
p29
aVif and how they've tackled
p30
aVtheir big economic and political challenges.
p31
aVAnd what I found astonished me.
p32
aVIt turns out that there are remarkable signs of progress out there,
p33
aVoften in the most unexpected places,
p34
aVand they've convinced me that our great global challenges
p35
aVmay not be so unsolvable after all.
p36
aVNot only are there theoretical fixes;
p37
aVthose fixes have been tried.
p38
aVThey've worked.
p39
aVAnd they offer hope for the rest of us.
p40
aa(lp41
VI'm going to show you what I mean
p42
aVby telling you about how three of the countries I visited \u2014
p43
aVCanada, Indonesia and Mexico \u2014
p44
aVovercame three supposedly impossible problems.
p45
aVTheir stories matter because they contain tools the rest of us can use,
p46
aVand not just for those particular problems,
p47
aVbut for many others, too.
p48
aa(lp49
VWhen most people think about my homeland, Canada, today,
p50
aVif they think about Canada at all,
p51
aVthey think cold, they think boring, they think polite.
p52
aVThey think we say "sorry" too much in our funny accents.
p53
aVAnd that's all true.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VSorry.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VBut Canada's also important
p62
aVbecause of its triumph over a problem
p63
aVcurrently tearing many other countries apart:
p64
aVimmigration.
p65
aVConsider, Canada today is among the world's most welcoming nations,
p66
aVeven compared to other immigration-friendly countries.
p67
aVIts per capita immigration rate is four times higher than France's,
p68
aVand its percentage of foreign-born residents
p69
aVis double that of Sweden.
p70
aVMeanwhile, Canada admitted
p71
aV10 times more Syrian refugees in the last year
p72
aVthan did the United States.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Applause)
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd now Canada is taking even more.
p77
aVAnd yet, if you ask Canadians
p78
aVwhat makes them proudest of their country,
p79
aVthey rank "multiculturalism,"
p80
aVa dirty word in most places,
p81
aVsecond,
p82
aVahead of hockey.
p83
aVHockey.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VIn other words, at a time when other countries
p88
aVare now frantically building new barriers to keep foreigners out,
p89
aVCanadians want even more of them in.
p90
aa(lp91
VNow, here's the really interesting part.
p92
aVCanada wasn't always like this.
p93
aVUntil the mid-1960s, Canada followed an explicitly racist immigration policy.
p94
aVThey called it "White Canada,"
p95
aVand as you can see, they were not just talking about the snow.
p96
aa(lp97
VSo how did that Canada become today's Canada?
p98
aVWell, despite what my mom in Ontario will tell you,
p99
aVthe answer had nothing to do with virtue.
p100
aVCanadians are not inherently better than anyone else.
p101
aVThe real explanation involves the man who became Canada's leader in 1968,
p102
aVPierre Trudeau, who is also the father of the current prime minister.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Applause)
p105
aa(lp106
VThe thing to know about that first Trudeau
p107
aVis that he was very different from Canada's previous leaders.
p108
aVHe was a French speaker in a country long-dominated by its English elite.
p109
aVHe was an intellectual.
p110
aVHe was even kind of groovy.
p111
aVI mean, seriously, the guy did yoga.
p112
aVHe hung out with the Beatles.
p113
aa(lp114
V(Laughter)
p115
aa(lp116
VAnd like all hipsters, he could be infuriating at times.
p117
aVBut he nevertheless pulled off
p118
aVone of the most progressive transformations any country has ever seen.
p119
aVHis formula, I've learned, involved two parts.
p120
aVFirst, Canada threw out its old race-based immigration rules,
p121
aVand it replaced them with new color-blind ones
p122
aVthat emphasized education, experience and language skills instead.
p123
aVAnd what that did was greatly increase the odds
p124
aVthat newcomers would contribute to the economy.
p125
aVThen part two, Trudeau created the world's first policy
p126
aVof official multiculturalism to promote integration
p127
aVand the idea that diversity was the key to Canada's identity.
p128
aa(lp129
VNow, in the years that followed, Ottawa kept pushing this message,
p130
aVbut at the same time, ordinary Canadians
p131
aVsoon started to see the economic, the material benefits of multiculturalism
p132
aVall around them.
p133
aVAnd these two influences soon combined
p134
aVto create the passionately open-minded Canada of today.
p135
aa(lp136
VLet's now turn to another country and an even tougher problem,
p137
aVIslamic extremism.
p138
aVIn 1998, the people of Indonesia took to the streets
p139
aVand overthrew their longtime dictator, Suharto.
p140
aVIt was an amazing moment,
p141
aVbut it was also a scary one.
p142
aVWith 250 million people,
p143
aVIndonesia is the largest Muslim-majority country on Earth.
p144
aVIt's also hot, huge and unruly,
p145
aVmade up of 17,000 islands,
p146
aVwhere people speak close to a thousand languages.
p147
aVNow, Suharto had been a dictator,
p148
aVand a nasty one.
p149
aVBut he'd also been a pretty effective tyrant,
p150
aVand he'd always been careful to keep religion out of politics.
p151
aVSo experts feared that without him keeping a lid on things,
p152
aVthe country would explode,
p153
aVor religious extremists would take over
p154
aVand turn Indonesia into a tropical version of Iran.
p155
aVAnd that's just what seemed to happen at first.
p156
aVIn the country's first free elections, in 1999,
p157
aVIslamist parties scored 36 percent of the vote,
p158
aVand the islands burned
p159
aVas riots and terror attacks killed thousands.
p160
aa(lp161
VSince then, however, Indonesia has taken a surprising turn.
p162
aVWhile ordinary folks have grown more pious on a personal level \u2014
p163
aVI saw a lot more headscarves on a recent visit
p164
aVthan I would have a decade ago \u2014
p165
aVthe country's politics have moved in the opposite direction.
p166
aVIndonesia is now a pretty decent democracy.
p167
aVAnd yet, its Islamist parties have steadily lost support,
p168
aVfrom a high of about 38 percent in 2004
p169
aVdown to 25 percent in 2014.
p170
aVAs for terrorism, it's now extremely rare.
p171
aVAnd while a few Indonesians have recently joined ISIS,
p172
aVtheir number is tiny,
p173
aVfar fewer in per capita terms
p174
aVthan the number of Belgians.
p175
aVTry to think of one other Muslim-majority country
p176
aVthat can say all those same things.
p177
aa(lp178
VIn 2014, I went to Indonesia to ask its current president,
p179
aVa soft-spoken technocrat named Joko Widodo,
p180
aV"Why is Indonesia thriving when so many other Muslim states are dying?"
p181
aa(lp182
V"Well, what we realized," he told me,
p183
aV"is that to deal with extremism, we needed to deal with inequality first."
p184
aa(lp185
VSee, Indonesia's religious parties, like similar parties elsewhere,
p186
aVhad tended to focus on things like reducing poverty and cutting corruption.
p187
aVSo that's what Joko and his predecessors did too,
p188
aVthereby stealing the Islamists' thunder.
p189
aVThey also cracked down hard on terrorism,
p190
aVbut Indonesia's democrats have learned a key lesson
p191
aVfrom the dark years of dictatorship,
p192
aVnamely that repression only creates more extremism.
p193
aVSo they waged their war with extraordinary delicacy.
p194
aVThey used the police instead of the army.
p195
aVThey only detained suspects if they had enough evidence.
p196
aVThey held public trials.
p197
aVThey even sent liberal imams into the jails
p198
aVto persuade the jihadists that terror is un-Islamic.
p199
aVAnd all of this paid off in spectacular fashion,
p200
aVcreating the kind of country that was unimaginable 20 years ago.
p201
aa(lp202
VSo at this point, my optimism should, I hope,
p203
aVbe starting to make a bit more sense.
p204
aVNeither immigration nor Islamic extremism are impossible to deal with.
p205
aVJoin me now on one last trip,
p206
aVthis time to Mexico.
p207
aVNow, of our three stories, this one probably surprised me the most,
p208
aVsince as you all know,
p209
aVthe country is still struggling with so many problems.
p210
aVAnd yet, a few years ago, Mexico did something
p211
aVthat many other countries from France to India to the United States
p212
aVcan still only dream of.
p213
aVIt shattered the political paralysis that had gripped it for years.
p214
aa(lp215
VTo understand how, we need to rewind to the year 2000,
p216
aVwhen Mexico finally became a democracy.
p217
aVRather than use their new freedoms to fight for reform,
p218
aVMexico's politicians used them to fight one another.
p219
aVCongress deadlocked, and the country's problems \u2014
p220
aVdrugs, poverty, crime, corruption \u2014
p221
aVspun out of control.
p222
aVThings got so bad that in 2008,
p223
aVthe Pentagon warned that Mexico risked collapse.
p224
aa(lp225
VThen in 2012, this guy named Enrique Peña Nieto
p226
aVsomehow got himself elected president.
p227
aVNow, this Peña hardly inspired much confidence at first.
p228
aVSure, he was handsome,
p229
aVbut he came from Mexico's corrupt old ruling party, the PRI,
p230
aVand he was a notorious womanizer.
p231
aVIn fact, he seemed like such a pretty boy lightweight
p232
aVthat women called him "bombón," sweetie,
p233
aVat campaign rallies.
p234
aVAnd yet this same bombón soon surprised everyone
p235
aVby hammering out a truce
p236
aVbetween the country's three warring political parties.
p237
aVAnd over the next 18 months, they together passed
p238
aVan incredibly comprehensive set of reforms.
p239
aVThey busted open Mexico's smothering monopolies.
p240
aVThey liberalized its rusting energy sector.
p241
aVThey restructured its failing schools, and much more.
p242
aVTo appreciate the scale of this accomplishment,
p243
aVtry to imagine the US Congress passing immigration reform,
p244
aVcampaign finance reform and banking reform.
p245
aVNow, try to imagine Congress doing it all at the same time.
p246
aVThat's what Mexico did.
p247
aa(lp248
VNot long ago, I met with Peña and asked how he managed it all.
p249
aVThe President flashed me his famous twinkly smile \u2014
p250
aa(lp251
V(Laughter)
p252
aa(lp253
Vand told me that the short answer was "compromiso," compromise.
p254
aVOf course, I pushed him for details,
p255
aVand the long answer that came out was essentially
p256
aV"compromise, compromise and more compromise."
p257
aVSee, Peña knew that he needed to build trust early,
p258
aVso he started talking to the opposition just days after his election.
p259
aVTo ward off pressure from special interests,
p260
aVhe kept their meetings small and secret,
p261
aVand many of the participants later told me that it was this intimacy,
p262
aVplus a lot of shared tequila,
p263
aVthat helped build confidence.
p264
aVSo did the fact that all decisions had to be unanimous,
p265
aVand that Peña even agreed to pass some of the other party's priorities
p266
aVbefore his own.
p267
aVAs Santiago Creel, an opposition senator, put it to me,
p268
aV"Look, I'm not saying that I'm special or that anyone is special,
p269
aVbut that group, that was special."
p270
aVThe proof?
p271
aVWhen Peña was sworn in, the pact held,
p272
aVand Mexico moved forward for the first time in years.
p273
aVBueno.
p274
aa(lp275
VSo now we've seen how these three countries
p276
aVovercame three of their great challenges.
p277
aVAnd that's very nice for them, right?
p278
aVBut what good does it do the rest of us?
p279
aa(lp280
VWell, in the course of studying these and a bunch of other success stories,
p281
aVlike the way Rwanda pulled itself back together after civil war
p282
aVor Brazil has reduced inequality,
p283
aVor South Korea has kept its economy growing faster and for longer
p284
aVthan any other country on Earth,
p285
aVI've noticed a few common threads.
p286
aa(lp287
VNow, before describing them, I need to add a caveat.
p288
aVI realize, of course, that all countries are unique.
p289
aVSo you can't simply take what worked in one,
p290
aVport it to another and expect it to work there too.
p291
aVNor do specific solutions work forever.
p292
aVYou've got to adapt them as circumstances change.
p293
aa(lp294
VThat said, by stripping these stories to their essence,
p295
aVyou absolutely can distill a few common tools for problem-solving
p296
aVthat will work in other countries
p297
aVand in boardrooms
p298
aVand in all sorts of other contexts, too.
p299
aa(lp300
VNumber one, embrace the extreme.
p301
aVIn all the stories we've just looked at,
p302
aVsalvation came at a moment of existential peril.
p303
aVAnd that was no coincidence.
p304
aVTake Canada: when Trudeau took office, he faced two looming dangers.
p305
aVFirst, though his vast, underpopulated country
p306
aVbadly needed more bodies,
p307
aVits preferred source for white workers, Europe,
p308
aVhad just stopped exporting them as it finally recovered from World War II.
p309
aVThe other problem was that Canada's long cold war
p310
aVbetween its French and its English communities
p311
aVhad just become a hot one.
p312
aVQuebec was threatening to secede,
p313
aVand Canadians were actually killing other Canadians over politics.
p314
aVNow, countries face crises all the time. Right?
p315
aVThat's nothing special.
p316
aVBut Trudeau's genius was to realize that Canada's crisis
p317
aVhad swept away all the hurdles that usually block reform.
p318
aVCanada had to open up. It had no choice.
p319
aVAnd it had to rethink its identity.
p320
aVAgain, it had no choice.
p321
aVAnd that gave Trudeau a once-in-a-generation opportunity
p322
aVto break the old rules and write new ones.
p323
aVAnd like all our other heroes, he was smart enough to seize it.
p324
aa(lp325
VNumber two, there's power in promiscuous thinking.
p326
aVAnother striking similarity among good problem-solvers
p327
aVis that they're all pragmatists.
p328
aVThey'll steal the best answers from wherever they find them,
p329
aVand they don't let details
p330
aVlike party or ideology or sentimentality get in their way.
p331
aVAs I mentioned earlier, Indonesia's democrats were clever enough
p332
aVto steal many of the Islamists' best campaign promises for themselves.
p333
aVThey even invited some of the radicals into their governing coalition.
p334
aVNow, that horrified a lot of secular Indonesians.
p335
aVBut by forcing the radicals to actually help govern,
p336
aVit quickly exposed the fact that they weren't any good at the job,
p337
aVand it got them mixed up in all of the grubby compromises
p338
aVand petty humiliations that are part of everyday politics.
p339
aVAnd that hurt their image so badly that they've never recovered.
p340
aa(lp341
VNumber three,
p342
aVplease all of the people some of the time.
p343
aVI know I just mentioned how crises can grant leaders extraordinary freedoms.
p344
aVAnd that's true, but problem-solving often requires more than just boldness.
p345
aVIt takes showing restraint, too,
p346
aVjust when that's the last thing you want to do.
p347
aVTake Trudeau: when he took office,
p348
aVhe could easily have put his core constituency,
p349
aVthat is Canada's French community, first.
p350
aVHe could have pleased some of the people all of the time.
p351
aVAnd Peña could have used his power to keep attacking the opposition,
p352
aVas was traditional in Mexico.
p353
aVYet he chose to embrace his enemies instead,
p354
aVwhile forcing his own party to compromise.
p355
aVAnd Trudeau pushed everyone to stop thinking in tribal terms
p356
aVand to see multiculturalism, not language and not skin color,
p357
aVas what made them quintessentially Canadian.
p358
aVNobody got everything they wanted,
p359
aVbut everyone got just enough that the bargains held.
p360
aa(lp361
VSo at this point you may be thinking,
p362
aV"OK, Tepperman,
p363
aVif the fixes really are out there like you keep insisting,
p364
aVthen why aren't more countries already using them?"
p365
aVIt's not like they require special powers to pull off.
p366
aVI mean, none of the leaders we've just looked at were superheroes.
p367
aVThey didn't accomplish anything on their own,
p368
aVand they all had plenty of flaws.
p369
aVTake Indonesia's first democratic president,
p370
aVAbdurrahman Wahid.
p371
aVThis man was so powerfully uncharismatic
p372
aVthat he once fell asleep
p373
aVin the middle of his own speech.
p374
aa(lp375
V(Laughter)
p376
aa(lp377
VTrue story.
p378
aa(lp379
VSo what this tells us is that the real obstacle is not ability,
p380
aVand it's not circumstances.
p381
aVIt's something much simpler.
p382
aVMaking big changes involves taking big risks,
p383
aVand taking big risks is scary.
p384
aVOvercoming that fear requires guts,
p385
aVand as you all know,
p386
aVgutsy politicians are painfully rare.
p387
aVBut that doesn't mean we voters
p388
aVcan't demand courage from our political leaders.
p389
aVI mean, that's why we put them in office in the first place.
p390
aVAnd given the state of the world today, there's really no other option.
p391
aa(lp392
VThe answers are out there,
p393
aVbut now it's up to us
p394
aVto elect more women and men
p395
aVbrave enough to find them,
p396
aVto steal them
p397
aVand to make them work.
p398
