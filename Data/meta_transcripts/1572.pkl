VSo if someone asked you
p4
aVfor the three words that would sum up
p5
aVyour reputation, what would you say?
p6
aVHow would people describe your judgment,
p7
aVyour knowledge, your behaviors, in different situations?
p8
aVToday I'd like to explore with you
p9
aVwhy the answer to this question
p10
aVwill become profoundly important
p11
aVin an age where reputation will be your most valuable asset.
p12
aa(lp13
VI'd like to start by introducing you to someone
p14
aVwhose life has been changed by a marketplace
p15
aVfueled by reputation.
p16
aVSebastian Sandys has been a bed and breakfast host
p17
aVon Airbnb since 2008.
p18
aVI caught up with him recently, where, over the course
p19
aVof several cups of tea, he told me how
p20
aVhosting guests from all over the world
p21
aVhas enriched his life.
p22
aVMore than 50 people have come to stay in the 18th-century
p23
aVwatchhouse he lives in with his cat, Squeak.
p24
aVNow, I mention Squeak because Sebastian's first guest
p25
aVhappened to see a rather large mouse run across the kitchen,
p26
aVand she promised that she would refrain from leaving
p27
aVa bad review on one condition: he got a cat.
p28
aVAnd so Sebastian bought Squeak to protect his reputation.
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, as many of you know, Airbnb is a peer-to-peer
p31
aVmarketplace that matches people who have space to rent
p32
aVwith people who are looking for a place to stay
p33
aVin over 192 countries.
p34
aVThe places being rented out are things that you might
p35
aVexpect, like spare rooms and holiday homes,
p36
aVbut part of the magic is the unique places
p37
aVthat you can now access: treehouses, teepees,
p38
aVairplane hangars, igloos.
p39
aVIf you don't like the hotel, there's a castle down the road
p40
aVthat you can rent for 5,000 dollars a night.
p41
aVIt's a fantastic example of how technology
p42
aVis creating a market
p43
aVfor things that never had a marketplace before.
p44
aa(lp45
VNow let me show you these heat maps of Paris
p46
aVto see how insanely fast it's growing.
p47
aVThis image here is from 2008.
p48
aVThe pink dots represent host properties.
p49
aVEven four years ago, letting strangers stay in your home
p50
aVseemed like a crazy idea.
p51
aVNow the same view in 2010.
p52
aVAnd now, 2012.
p53
aVThere is an Airbnb host on almost every main street in Paris.
p54
aVNow, what's happening here is people are realizing
p55
aVthe power of technology to unlock the idling capacity
p56
aVand value of all kinds of assets,
p57
aVfrom skills to spaces to material possessions,
p58
aVin ways and on a scale never possible before.
p59
aVIt's an economy and culture called collaborative consumption,
p60
aVand, through it, people like Sebastian
p61
aVare becoming micro-entrepreneurs.
p62
aVThey're empowered to make money and save money
p63
aVfrom their existing assets.
p64
aa(lp65
VBut the real magic and the secret source behind
p66
aVcollaborative consumption marketplaces like Airbnb
p67
aVisn't the inventory or the money.
p68
aVIt's using the power of technology to build trust
p69
aVbetween strangers.
p70
aVThis side of Airbnb really hit home to Sebastian last summer
p71
aVduring the London riots.
p72
aVHe woke up around 9, and he checked his email
p73
aVand he saw a bunch of messages all asking him
p74
aVif he was okay.
p75
aVFormer guests from around the world had seen that
p76
aVthe riots were happening just down the street, and wanted
p77
aVto check if he needed anything.
p78
aVSebastian actually said to me, he said, "Thirteen former guests
p79
aVcontacted me before my own mother rang." (Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VNow, this little anecdote gets to the heart of why
p82
aVI'm really passionate about collaborative consumption,
p83
aVand why, after I finished my book, I decided
p84
aVI'm going to try and spread this into a global movement.
p85
aVBecause at its core, it's about empowerment.
p86
aVIt's about empowering people to make meaningful connections,
p87
aVconnections that are enabling us to rediscover
p88
aVa humanness that we've lost somewhere along the way,
p89
aVby engaging in marketplaces like Airbnb, like Kickstarter,
p90
aVlike Etsy, that are built on personal relationships
p91
aVversus empty transactions.
p92
aa(lp93
VNow the irony is that these ideas are actually taking us back
p94
aVto old market principles and collaborative behaviors
p95
aVthat are hard-wired in all of us.
p96
aVThey're just being reinvented in ways that are relevant
p97
aVfor the Facebook age.
p98
aVWe're literally beginning to realize that we have wired
p99
aVour world to share, swap, rent, barter or trade
p100
aVjust about anything. We're sharing our cars on WhipCar,
p101
aVour bikes on Spinlister, our offices on Loosecubes,
p102
aVour gardens on Landshare. We're lending and borrowing
p103
aVmoney from strangers on Zopa and Lending Club.
p104
aVWe are trading lessons on everything from sushi-making
p105
aVto coding on Skillshare,
p106
aVand we're even sharing our pets on DogVacay.
p107
aVNow welcome to the wonderful world of collaborative consumption
p108
aVthat's enabling us to match wants with haves
p109
aVin more democratic ways.
p110
aa(lp111
VNow, collaborative consumption is creating the start
p112
aVof a transformation in the way we think about supply and demand,
p113
aVbut it's also a part of a massive value shift underway,
p114
aVwhere instead of consuming to keep up with the Joneses,
p115
aVpeople are consuming to get to know the Joneses.
p116
aVBut the key reason why it's taking off now so fast
p117
aVis because every new advancement of technology
p118
aVincreases the efficiency and the social glue of trust
p119
aVto make sharing easier and easier.
p120
aa(lp121
VNow, I've looked at thousands of these marketplaces,
p122
aVand trust and efficiency are always the critical ingredients.
p123
aVLet me give you an example.
p124
aVMeet 46-year-old Chris Mok, who has, I bet,
p125
aVthe best job title here of SuperRabbit.
p126
aVNow, four years ago, Chris lost his job, unfortunately,
p127
aVas an art buyer at Macy's, and like so many people,
p128
aVhe struggled to find a new one during the recession.
p129
aVAnd then he happened to stumble across a post about
p130
aVTaskRabbit.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, the story behind TaskRabbit starts like so many
p133
aVgreat stories with a very cute dog by the name of Kobe.
p134
aVNow what happened was, in February 2008,
p135
aVLeah and her husband were waiting for a cab to take them
p136
aVout for dinner, when Kobe came trotting up to them
p137
aVand he was salivating with saliva.
p138
aVThey realized they'd run out of dog food.
p139
aVKevin had to cancel the cab and trudge out in the snow.
p140
aVNow, later that evening, the two self-confessed tech geeks
p141
aVstarting talking about how cool it would be if some kind of
p142
aVeBay for errands existed.
p143
aVSix months later, Leah quit her job,
p144
aVand TaskRabbit was born.
p145
aVAt the time, she didn't realize that she was actually hitting
p146
aVon a bigger idea she later called service networking.
p147
aVIt's essentially about how we use our online relationships
p148
aVto get things done in the real world.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow the way TaskRabbit works is, people outsource
p151
aVthe tasks that they want doing, name the price
p152
aVthey're willing to pay, and then vetted Rabbits
p153
aVbid to run the errand.
p154
aVYes, there's actually a four-stage, rigorous interview process
p155
aVthat's designed to find the people that would make
p156
aVgreat personal assistants and weed out the dodgy Rabbits.
p157
aVNow, there's over 4,000 Rabbits across the United States
p158
aVand 5,000 more on the waiting list.
p159
aa(lp160
VNow the tasks being posted are things that you might
p161
aVexpect, like help with household chores
p162
aVor doing some supermarket runs.
p163
aVI actually learned the other day that 12 and a half thousand
p164
aVloads of laundry have been cleaned and folded
p165
aVthrough TaskRabbit.
p166
aVBut I love that the number one task posted,
p167
aVover a hundred times a day, is something that many of us
p168
aVhave felt the pain of doing:
p169
aVyes, assembling Ikea furniture. (Laughter) (Applause)
p170
aVIt's brilliant. Now, we may laugh, but Chris here
p171
aVis actually making up to 5,000 dollars a month
p172
aVrunning errands around his life.
p173
aVAnd 70 percent of this new labor force
p174
aVwere previously unemployed or underemployed.
p175
aVI think TaskRabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption
p176
aVare like lemonade stands on steroids. They're just brilliant.
p177
aa(lp178
VNow, when you think about it, it's amazing, right,
p179
aVthat over the past 20 years, we've evolved
p180
aVfrom trusting people online to share information
p181
aVto trusting to handing over our credit card information,
p182
aVand now we're entering the third trust wave:
p183
aVconnecting trustworthy strangers to create all kinds
p184
aVof people-powered marketplaces.
p185
aVI actually came across this fascinating study
p186
aVby the Pew Center this week that revealed
p187
aVthat an active Facebook user is three times as likely
p188
aVas a non-Internet user to believe that most people are trustworthy.
p189
aVVirtual trust will transform the way we trust one another
p190
aVface to face.
p191
aa(lp192
VNow, with all of my optimism, and I am an optimist,
p193
aVcomes a healthy dose of caution, or rather, an urgent need
p194
aVto address some pressing, complex questions.
p195
aVHow to ensure our digital identities reflect our
p196
aVreal world identities? Do we want them to be the same?
p197
aVHow do we mimic the way trust is built face-to-face online?
p198
aVHow do we stop people who've behaved badly
p199
aVin one community doing so under a different guise?
p200
aVIn a similar way that companies often use some kind of
p201
aVcredit rating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan,
p202
aVor the rate of a mortgage, marketplaces that depend
p203
aVon transactions between relative strangers
p204
aVneed some kind of device to let you know that Sebastian
p205
aVand Chris are good eggs,
p206
aVand that device is reputation.
p207
aa(lp208
VReputation is the measurement of how much a community trusts you.
p209
aVLet's just take a look at Chris.
p210
aVYou can see that over 200 people have given him
p211
aVan average rating over 4.99 out of 5.
p212
aVThere are over 20 pages of reviews of his work
p213
aVdescribing him as super-friendly and fast,
p214
aVand he's reached level 25, the highest level,
p215
aVmaking him a SuperRabbit.
p216
aVNow \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 I love that word, SuperRabbit.
p217
aVAnd interestingly, what Chris has noted is that as his reputation
p218
aVhas gone up, so has his chances of winning a bid
p219
aVand how much he can charge.
p220
aVIn other words, for SuperRabbits, reputation
p221
aVhas a real world value.
p222
aa(lp223
VNow, I know what you might be thinking.
p224
aVWell, this isn't anything new. Just think of power sellers
p225
aVon eBay or star ratings on Amazon.
p226
aVThe difference today is that, with every trade we make,
p227
aVcomment we leave, person we flag, badge we earn,
p228
aVwe leave a reputation trail
p229
aVof how well we can and can't be trusted.
p230
aVAnd it's not just the breadth but the volume
p231
aVof reputation data out there that is staggering.
p232
aVJust consider this: Five million nights have been booked
p233
aVon Airbnb in the past six months alone.
p234
aV30 million rides have been shared on Carpooling.com.
p235
aVThis year, two billion dollars worth of loans
p236
aVwill go through peer-to-peer lending platforms.
p237
aVThis adds up to millions of pieces of reputation data
p238
aVon how well we behave or misbehave.
p239
aa(lp240
VNow, capturing and correlating the trails of information
p241
aVthat we leave in different places is a massive challenge,
p242
aVbut one we're being asked to figure out.
p243
aVWhat the likes of Sebastian are starting to rightfully ask
p244
aVis, shouldn't they own their reputation data?
p245
aVShouldn't the reputation that he's personally invested
p246
aVon building on Airbnb mean that it should travel with him
p247
aVfrom one community to another?
p248
aVWhat I mean by this is, say he started selling second-hand
p249
aVbooks on Amazon. Why should he have to start from scratch?
p250
aVIt's a bit like when I moved from New York to Sydney.
p251
aVIt was ridiculous. I couldn't get a mobile phone plan
p252
aVbecause my credit history didn't travel with me.
p253
aVI was essentially a ghost in the system.
p254
aa(lp255
VNow I'm not suggesting that the next stage
p256
aVof the reputation economy is about
p257
aVadding up multiple ratings into some kind of empty score.
p258
aVPeople's lives are too complex, and who wants to do that?
p259
aVI also want to be clear that this isn't about adding up
p260
aVtweets and likes and friends in a clout-like fashion.
p261
aVThose guys are measuring influence, not behaviors
p262
aVthat indicate our trustworthiness.
p263
aa(lp264
VBut the most important thing that we have to keep in mind
p265
aVis that reputation is largely contextual.
p266
aVJust because Sebastian is a wonderful host
p267
aVdoes not mean that he can assemble Ikea furniture.
p268
aVThe big challenge is figuring out what data
p269
aVmakes sense to pull, because the future's
p270
aVgoing to be driven by a smart aggregation of reputation,
p271
aVnot a single algorithm.
p272
aVIt's only a matter of time before we'll be able to perform
p273
aVa Facebook- or Google-like search
p274
aVand see a complete picture of someone's behaviors
p275
aVin different contexts over time.
p276
aVI envision a realtime stream of who has trusted you,
p277
aVwhen, where and why, your reliability on TaskRabbit,
p278
aVyour cleanliness as a guest on Airbnb,
p279
aVthe knowledge that you display on Quora or [unclear],
p280
aVthey'll all live together in one place,
p281
aVand this will live in some kind of reputation dashboard
p282
aVthat will paint a picture of your reputation capital.
p283
aa(lp284
VNow this is a concept that I'm currently researching
p285
aVand writing my next book on, and currently define
p286
aVas the worth of your reputation, your intentions,
p287
aVcapabilities and values across communities and marketplaces.
p288
aVThis isn't some far-off frontier.
p289
aVThere are actually a wave of startups like Connect.Me
p290
aVand Legit and TrustCloud that are figuring out how
p291
aVyou can aggregate, monitor and use your online reputation.
p292
aa(lp293
VNow, I realize that this concept may sound a little
p294
aVBig Brother to some of you, and yes, there are some
p295
aVenormous transparency and privacy issues to solve,
p296
aVbut ultimately, if we can collect our personal reputation,
p297
aVwe can actually control it more, and extract
p298
aVthe immense value that will flow from it.
p299
aa(lp300
VAlso, more so than our credit history,
p301
aVwe can actually shape our reputation.
p302
aVJust think of Sebastian
p303
aVand how he bought the cat to influence his.
p304
aa(lp305
VNow privacy issues aside, the other really interesting issue
p306
aVI'm looking at is how do we empower digital ghosts,
p307
aVpeople [who] for whatever reason, are not active online,
p308
aVbut are some of the most trustworthy people in the world?
p309
aVHow do we take their contributions to their jobs,
p310
aVtheir communities and their families,
p311
aVand convert that value into reputation capital?
p312
aa(lp313
VUltimately, when we get it right, reputation capital
p314
aVcould create a massive positive disruption
p315
aVin who has power, trust and influence.
p316
aVA three-digit score, your traditional credit history,
p317
aVthat only 30 percent of us actually know what it is,
p318
aVwill no longer be the determining factor
p319
aVin how much things cost, what we can access,
p320
aVand, in many instances, limit what we can do in the world.
p321
aVIndeed, reputation is a currency that I believe will become
p322
aVmore powerful than our credit history in the 21st century.
p323
aVReputation will be the currency that says
p324
aVthat you can trust me.
p325
aa(lp326
VNow the interesting thing is, reputation
p327
aVis the socioeconomic lubricant
p328
aVthat makes collaborative consumption work and scale,
p329
aVbut the sources it will be generated from,
p330
aVand its applications, are far bigger than this space alone.
p331
aVLet me give you one example from the world of recruiting,
p332
aVwhere reputation data will make the résumé seem
p333
aVlike an archaic relic of the past.
p334
aa(lp335
VFour years ago, tech bloggers and entrepreneurs
p336
aVJoel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood, decided to start something
p337
aVcalled Stack Overflow.
p338
aVNow, Stack Overflow is basically a platform where
p339
aVexperienced programmers can ask
p340
aVother good programmers highly detailed technical questions
p341
aVon things like tiny pixels and chrome extensions.
p342
aVThis site receives five and a half thousand questions a day,
p343
aVand 80 percent of these receive accurate answers.
p344
aVNow users earn reputation in a whole range of ways,
p345
aVbut it's basically by convincing their peers
p346
aVthey know what they're talking about.
p347
aa(lp348
VNow a few months after this site launched, the founders
p349
aVheard about something interesting,
p350
aVand it actually didn't surprise them.
p351
aVWhat they heard was that users were putting
p352
aVtheir reputation scores on the top of their résumés,
p353
aVand that recruiters were searching the platform
p354
aVto find people with unique talents.
p355
aVNow thousands of programmers today are finding
p356
aVbetter jobs this way, because Stack Overflow
p357
aVand the reputation dashboards provide a priceless window
p358
aVinto how someone really behaves,
p359
aVand what their peers think of them.
p360
aa(lp361
VBut the bigger principle of what's happening behind Stack Overflow,
p362
aVI think, is incredibly exciting.
p363
aVPeople are starting to realize that the reputation
p364
aVthey generate in one place has value
p365
aVbeyond the environments from which it was built.
p366
aVYou know, it's very interesting.
p367
aVWhen you talk to super-users, whether that's SuperRabbits
p368
aVor super-people on Stack Overflow, or Uberhosts,
p369
aVthey all talk about how having a high reputation
p370
aVunlocks a sense of their own power.
p371
aVOn Stack Overflow, it creates a level playing field,
p372
aVenabling the people with the real talent to rise to the top.
p373
aVOn Airbnb, the people often become more important
p374
aVthan the spaces. On TaskRabbit,
p375
aVit gives people control of their economic activity.
p376
aa(lp377
VNow at the end of my tea with Sebastian, he told me how,
p378
aVon a bad, rainy day, when he hasn't had a customer
p379
aVin his bookstore, he thinks of all the people around
p380
aVthe world who've said something wonderful about him,
p381
aVand what that says about him as a person.
p382
aVHe's turning 50 this year, and he's convinced
p383
aVthat the rich tapestry of reputation he's built on Airbnb
p384
aVwill lead him to doing something interesting
p385
aVwith the rest of his life.
p386
aa(lp387
VYou know, there are only a few windows in history
p388
aVwhere the opportunity exists to reinvent
p389
aVpart of how our socioeconomic system works.
p390
aVWe're living through one of those moments.
p391
aVI believe that we are at the start of a collaborative revolution
p392
aVthat will be as significant as the Industrial Revolution.
p393
aVIn the 20th century, the invention of traditional credit
p394
aVtransformed our consumer system, and in many ways
p395
aVcontrolled who had access to what.
p396
aVIn the 21st century, new trust networks,
p397
aVand the reputation capital they generate, will reinvent
p398
aVthe way we think about wealth, markets, power
p399
aVand personal identity, in ways we can't yet even imagine.
