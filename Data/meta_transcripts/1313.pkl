VThere have been many revolutions over the last century,
p4
aVbut perhaps none as significant as the longevity revolution.
p5
aVWe are living on average today 34 years longer
p6
aVthan our great-grandparents did \u2014 think about that.
p7
aVThat's an entire second adult lifetime
p8
aVthat's been added to our lifespan.
p9
aVAnd yet, for the most part,
p10
aVour culture has not come to terms with what this means.
p11
aVWe're still living with the old paradigm
p12
aVof age as an arch.
p13
aVThat's the metaphor, the old metaphor.
p14
aVYou're born, you peak at midlife
p15
aVand decline into decrepitude.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VAge as pathology.
p20
aa(lp21
VBut many people today \u2014 philosophers, artists, doctors, scientists \u2014
p22
aVare taking a new look at what I call "the third act" \u2014
p23
aVthe last three decades of life.
p24
aVThey realize that this is actually a developmental stage of life
p25
aVwith its own significance,
p26
aVas different from midlife as adolescence is from childhood.
p27
aVAnd they are asking \u2014 we should all be asking:
p28
aVHow do we use this time?
p29
aVHow do we live it successfully?
p30
aVWhat is the appropriate new metaphor for aging?
p31
aa(lp32
VI've spent the last year researching and writing about this subject.
p33
aVAnd I have come to find that a more appropriate metaphor for aging
p34
aVis a staircase \u2014
p35
aVthe upward ascension of the human spirit,
p36
aVbringing us into wisdom, wholeness, and authenticity.
p37
aVAge not at all as pathology.
p38
aVAge as potential.
p39
aVAnd guess what?
p40
aVThis potential is not for the lucky few.
p41
aVIt turns out, most people over 50
p42
aVfeel better, are less stressed, less hostile, less anxious.
p43
aVWe tend to see commonalities more than differences.
p44
aVSome of the studies even say we're happier.
p45
aa(lp46
V(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VThis is not what I expected, trust me.
p49
aVI come from a long line of depressives.
p50
aVAs I was approaching my late 40s,
p51
aVwhen I would wake up in the morning,
p52
aVmy first six thoughts would all be negative.
p53
aVAnd I got scared.
p54
aVI thought, "Oh my gosh. I'm going to become a crotchety old lady."
p55
aVBut now that I am actually smack-dab in the middle of my own third act,
p56
aVI realize I've never been happier.
p57
aVI have such a powerful feeling of well-being.
p58
aVAnd I've discovered
p59
aVthat when you're inside oldness,
p60
aVas opposed to looking at it from the outside,
p61
aVfear subsides.
p62
aVYou realize you're still yourself \u2014
p63
aVmaybe even more so.
p64
aVPicasso once said, "It takes a long time to become young."
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VI don't want to romanticize aging.
p69
aVObviously, there's no guarantee
p70
aVthat it can be a time of fruition and growth.
p71
aVSome of it is a matter of luck.
p72
aVSome of it, obviously, is genetic.
p73
aVOne third of it, in fact, is genetic.
p74
aVAnd there isn't much we can do about that.
p75
aVBut that means that two-thirds of how well we do in the third act,
p76
aVwe can do something about.
p77
aVWe're going to discuss what we can do
p78
aVto make these added years really successful,
p79
aVand use them to make a difference.
p80
aa(lp81
VNow, let me say something about the staircase,
p82
aVwhich may seem like an odd metaphor for seniors,
p83
aVgiven the fact that many seniors are challenged by stairs.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Laughter)
p86
aa(lp87
VMyself included.
p88
aVAs you may know, the entire world operates on a universal law:
p89
aVentropy, the second law of thermodynamics.
p90
aVEntropy means that everything in the world \u2014 everything \u2014
p91
aVis in a state of decline and decay \u2014
p92
aVthe arch.
p93
aVThere's only one exception to this universal law,
p94
aVand that is the human spirit,
p95
aVwhich can continue to evolve upwards, the staircase,
p96
aVbringing us into wholeness, authenticity, and wisdom.
p97
aa(lp98
VAnd here's an example of what I mean.
p99
aVThis upward ascension
p100
aVcan happen even in the face of extreme physical challenges.
p101
aVAbout three years ago, I read an article in the New York Times.
p102
aVIt was about a man named Neil Selinger \u2014
p103
aV57 years old, a retired lawyer,
p104
aVwho had joined the writers' group at Sarah Lawrence,
p105
aVwhere he found his writer's voice.
p106
aVTwo years later,
p107
aVhe was diagnosed with ALS, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
p108
aVIt's a terrible disease. It's fatal.
p109
aVIt wastes the body, but the mind remains intact.
p110
aVIn this article, Mr. Selinger wrote the following
p111
aVto describe what was happening to him.
p112
aVAnd I quote:
p113
aV"As my muscles weakened,
p114
aVmy writing became stronger.
p115
aVAs I slowly lost my speech,
p116
aVI gained my voice.
p117
aVAs I diminished, I grew.
p118
aVAs I lost so much,
p119
aVI finally started to find myself."
p120
aVNeil Selinger, to me,
p121
aVis the embodiment of mounting the staircase
p122
aVin his third act.
p123
aa(lp124
VNow we're all born with spirit, all of us,
p125
aVbut sometimes it gets tamped down beneath the challenges of life,
p126
aVviolence, abuse, neglect.
p127
aVPerhaps our parents suffered from depression.
p128
aVPerhaps they weren't able to love us beyond how we performed in the world.
p129
aVPerhaps we still suffer from a psychic pain, a wound.
p130
aVPerhaps we feel that many of our relationships
p131
aVhave not had closure.
p132
aVAnd so we can feel unfinished.
p133
aVPerhaps the task of the third act
p134
aVis to finish up the task of finishing ourselves.
p135
aa(lp136
VFor me, it began as I was approaching my third act, my 60th birthday.
p137
aVHow was I supposed to live it?
p138
aVWhat was I supposed to accomplish in this final act?
p139
aVAnd I realized that, in order to know where I was going,
p140
aVI had to know where I'd been.
p141
aVAnd so I went back and I studied my first two acts,
p142
aVtrying to see who I was then,
p143
aVwho I really was, not who my parents or other people told me I was,
p144
aVor treated me like I was.
p145
aVBut who was I?
p146
aVWho were my parents \u2014 not as parents, but as people?
p147
aVWho were my grandparents?
p148
aVHow did they treat my parents?
p149
aVThese kinds of things.
p150
aa(lp151
VI discovered, a couple of years later,
p152
aVthat this process that I had gone through
p153
aVis called by psychologists "doing a life review."
p154
aVAnd they say it can give new significance and clarity and meaning
p155
aVto a person's life.
p156
aVYou may discover, as I did,
p157
aVthat a lot of things that you used to think were your fault,
p158
aVa lot of things you used to think about yourself,
p159
aVreally had nothing to do with you.
p160
aVIt wasn't your fault; you're just fine.
p161
aVAnd you're able to go back and forgive them.
p162
aVAnd forgive yourself.
p163
aVYou're able to free yourself
p164
aVfrom your past.
p165
aVYou can work to change your relationship to your past.
p166
aa(lp167
VNow while I was writing about this,
p168
aVI came upon a book called "Man's Search for Meaning"
p169
aVby Viktor Frankl.
p170
aVViktor Frankl was a German psychiatrist
p171
aVwho'd spent five years in a Nazi concentration camp.
p172
aVAnd he wrote that, while he was in the camp,
p173
aVhe could tell, should they ever be released,
p174
aVwhich of the people would be OK, and which would not.
p175
aVAnd he wrote this:
p176
aV"Everything you have in life can be taken from you
p177
aVexcept one thing:
p178
aVyour freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation.
p179
aVThis is what determines the quality of the life we've lived \u2014
p180
aVnot whether we've been rich or poor,
p181
aVfamous or unknown,
p182
aVhealthy or suffering.
p183
aVWhat determines our quality of life is how we relate to these realities,
p184
aVwhat kind of meaning we assign them,
p185
aVwhat kind of attitude we cling to about them,
p186
aVwhat state of mind we allow them to trigger."
p187
aa(lp188
VPerhaps the central purpose of the third act
p189
aVis to go back and to try, if appropriate,
p190
aVto change our relationship to the past.
p191
aVIt turns out that cognitive research shows
p192
aVwhen we are able to do this,
p193
aVit manifests neurologically \u2014
p194
aVneural pathways are created in the brain.
p195
aVYou see, if you have, over time,
p196
aVreacted negatively to past events and people,
p197
aVneural pathways are laid down
p198
aVby chemical and electrical signals that are sent through the brain.
p199
aVAnd over time, these neural pathways become hardwired.
p200
aVThey become the norm \u2014 even if it's bad for us,
p201
aVbecause it causes us stress and anxiety.
p202
aa(lp203
VIf, however,
p204
aVwe can go back and alter our relationship,
p205
aVre-vision our relationship to past people and events,
p206
aVneural pathways can change.
p207
aVAnd if we can maintain the more positive feelings
p208
aVabout the past,
p209
aVthat becomes the new norm.
p210
aVIt's like resetting a thermostat.
p211
aVIt's not having experiences
p212
aVthat makes us wise.
p213
aVIt's reflecting on the experiences that we've had that makes us wise
p214
aVand that helps us become whole,
p215
aVbrings wisdom and authenticity.
p216
aVIt helps us become what we might have been.
p217
aa(lp218
VWomen start off whole, don't we?
p219
aVI mean, as girls, we're feisty \u2014 "Yeah? Who says?"
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VWe have agency.
p224
aVWe are the subjects of our own lives.
p225
aVBut very often,
p226
aVmany, if not most of us, when we hit puberty,
p227
aVwe start worrying about fitting in and being popular.
p228
aVAnd we become the subjects and objects of other people's lives.
p229
aVBut now, in our third acts,
p230
aVit may be possible for us to circle back to where we started,
p231
aVand know it for the first time.
p232
aVAnd if we can do that,
p233
aVit will not just be for ourselves.
p234
aVOlder women are the largest demographic in the world.
p235
aVIf we can go back and redefine ourselves
p236
aVand become whole,
p237
aVthis will create a cultural shift in the world,
p238
aVand it will give an example to younger generations
p239
aVso that they can reconceive their own lifespan.
