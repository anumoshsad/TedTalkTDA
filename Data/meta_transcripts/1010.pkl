VI grew up
p4
aVin a very small village in Canada,
p5
aVand I'm an undiagnosed
p6
aVdyslexic.
p7
aVI had a really hard time in school.
p8
aVIn fact, my mother told me eventually
p9
aVthat I was the little kid in the village
p10
aVwho cried all the way to school.
p11
aVI ran away.
p12
aVI left when I was 25 years old to go to Bali,
p13
aVand there I met my incredible wife, Cynthia,
p14
aVand together, over 20 years,
p15
aVwe built an amazing jewelry business.
p16
aVIt was a fairy tale, and then we retired.
p17
aVThen she took me to see a film
p18
aVthat I really didn't want to see.
p19
aVIt ruined my life \u2014
p20
aV(Laughter)
p21
aV"The Inconvenient Truth" and Mr. Gore.
p22
aVI have four kids,
p23
aVand even if part of what he says is true,
p24
aVthey're not going to have the life that I had.
p25
aVAnd I decided at that moment
p26
aVthat I would spend the rest of my life
p27
aVdoing whatever I could
p28
aVto improve their possibilities.
p29
aVSo here's the world,
p30
aVand here we are in Bali.
p31
aVIt's a tiny, little island \u2014
p32
aV60 miles by 90 miles.
p33
aVIt has an intact Hindu culture.
p34
aVCynthia and I were there.
p35
aVWe had had a wonderful life there,
p36
aVand we decided to do something unusual.
p37
aVWe decided to give back
p38
aVlocally.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd here it is: it's called the Green School.
p41
aVI know it doesn't look like a school,
p42
aVbut it is something we decided to do,
p43
aVand it is extremely,
p44
aVextremely green.
p45
aVThe classrooms have no walls.
p46
aVThe teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard.
p47
aVThe desks are not square.
p48
aVAt Green School, the children are smiling \u2014
p49
aVan unusual thing for school, especially for me.
p50
aVAnd we practice holism.
p51
aVAnd for me it's just the idea
p52
aVthat, if this little girl
p53
aVgraduates as a whole person,
p54
aVchances are
p55
aVshe'll demand a whole world \u2014
p56
aVa whole world \u2014
p57
aVto live on.
p58
aVOur children spend 181 days
p59
aVgoing to school in a box.
p60
aVThe people that built my school
p61
aValso built the prison and the insane asylum
p62
aVout of the same materials.
p63
aVSo if this gentleman
p64
aVhad had a holistic education,
p65
aVwould he be sitting there?
p66
aVWould he have had more possibilities in his life?
p67
aa(lp68
VThe classrooms have natural light.
p69
aVThey're beautiful. They're bamboo.
p70
aVThe breeze passes through them.
p71
aVAnd when the natural breeze isn't enough,
p72
aVthe kids deploy bubbles,
p73
aVbut not the kind of bubbles you know.
p74
aVThese bubbles are made from natural cotton
p75
aVand rubber from the rubber tree.
p76
aVSo we basically turned the box
p77
aVinto a bubble.
p78
aVAnd these kids know
p79
aVthat painless climate control
p80
aVmay not be
p81
aVpart of their future.
p82
aVWe pay the bill at the end of the month,
p83
aVbut the people that are really going to pay the bill
p84
aVare our grandchildren.
p85
aVWe have to teach the kids
p86
aVthat the world is not indestructible.
p87
aVThese kids did a little graffiti on their desks,
p88
aVand then they signed up for two extra courses.
p89
aVThe first one was called sanding
p90
aVand the second one was called re-waxing.
p91
aVBut since that happened,
p92
aVthey own those desks.
p93
aVThey know they can control their world.
p94
aa(lp95
VWe're on the grid. We're not proud of it.
p96
aVBut an amazing alternative energy company in Paris
p97
aVis taking us off the grid with solar.
p98
aVAnd this thing
p99
aVis the second vortex to be built in the world,
p100
aVin a two-and-a-half meter drop on a river.
p101
aVWhen the turbine drops in,
p102
aVit will produce 8,000 watts of electricity,
p103
aVday and night.
p104
aVAnd you know what these are.
p105
aVThere's nowhere to flush.
p106
aVAnd as long as we're taking our waste
p107
aVand mixing it with a huge amount of water \u2014
p108
aVyou're all really smart, just do the math.
p109
aVHow many people times how much water.
p110
aVThere isn't enough water.
p111
aVThese are compost toilets,
p112
aVand nobody at the school wanted to know about them,
p113
aVespecially the principal.
p114
aVAnd they work. People use them. People are okay.
p115
aVIt's something you should think about doing.
p116
aVNot many things didn't work.
p117
aVThe beautiful canvas and rubber skylights
p118
aVgot eaten by the sun in six months.
p119
aVWe had to replace them with recyclable plastic.
p120
aVThe teachers dragged giant PVC whiteboards
p121
aVinto the classrooms.
p122
aVSo we had some good ideas:
p123
aVwe took old automobile windshields, put paper behind them
p124
aVand created the first alternative
p125
aVto the whiteboard.
p126
aa(lp127
VGreen School sits in south-central Bali,
p128
aVand it's on 20 acres
p129
aVof rolling garden.
p130
aVThere's an amazing river traveling through it,
p131
aVand you can see there
p132
aVhow we manage to get across the river.
p133
aVI met a father the other day; he looked a little crazed.
p134
aVI said, "Welcome to Green School."
p135
aVHe said, "I've been on an airplane for 24 hours."
p136
aVI asked him, "Why?"
p137
aVHe said, "I had a dream once about a green school,
p138
aVand I saw a picture of this green school,
p139
aVI got on an airplane.
p140
aVIn August I'm bringing my sons."
p141
aVThis was a great thing.
p142
aVBut more than that,
p143
aVpeople are building green houses around Green School,
p144
aVso their kids can walk to school on the paths.
p145
aVAnd people are bringing their green industries,
p146
aVhopefully their green restaurants,
p147
aVto the Green School.
p148
aVIt's becoming a community.
p149
aVIt's becoming a green model.
p150
aVWe had to look at everything.
p151
aVNo petrochemicals in the pavement.
p152
aVNo pavement.
p153
aVThese are volcanic stones laid by hand.
p154
aVThere are no sidewalks.
p155
aVThe sidewalks are gravel. They flood when it rains,
p156
aVbut they're green.
p157
aa(lp158
VThis is the school buffalo.
p159
aVHe's planning to eat that fence for dinner.
p160
aVAll the fences at Green School are green.
p161
aVAnd when the kindergarten kids
p162
aVrecently moved their gate,
p163
aVthey found out the fence was made out of tapioca.
p164
aVThey took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen,
p165
aVsliced them thinly and made delicious chips.
p166
aVLandscaping.
p167
aVWe manage to keep the garden that was there
p168
aVrunning right up to the edge of each of the classrooms.
p169
aVWe dropped them gently in.
p170
aVWe made space for these guys
p171
aVwho are Bali's last black pigs.
p172
aVAnd the school cow
p173
aVis trying to figure out
p174
aVhow to replace the lawnmower
p175
aVon the playing field.
p176
aa(lp177
VThese young ladies
p178
aVare living in a rice culture,
p179
aVbut they know something that few people know in a rice culture.
p180
aVThey know how to plant organic rice,
p181
aVthey know how to look after it,
p182
aVthey know how to harvest and they know how to cook it.
p183
aVThey're part of the rice cycle
p184
aVand these skills will be valuable
p185
aVfor them in their future.
p186
aVThis young man is picking organic vegetables.
p187
aVWe feed 400 people lunch every day
p188
aVand it's not a normal lunch. There's no gas.
p189
aVLocal Balinese women
p190
aVcook the food on sawdust burners
p191
aVusing secrets that only their grandmothers know.
p192
aVThe food is incredible.
p193
aa(lp194
VGreen School is a place of pioneers,
p195
aVlocal and global.
p196
aVAnd it's a kind of microcosm
p197
aVof the globalized world.
p198
aVThe kids are from 25 countries.
p199
aVWhen I see them together,
p200
aVI know that they're working out
p201
aVhow to live in the future.
p202
aVGreen School is going into its third year
p203
aVwith 160 children.
p204
aVIt's a school where you do learn reading \u2014
p205
aVone of my favorites \u2014
p206
aVwriting \u2014 I was bad at it \u2014
p207
aVarithmetic.
p208
aVBut you also learn other things.
p209
aVYou learn bamboo building.
p210
aVYou practice
p211
aVancient Balinese arts.
p212
aVThis is called mud wrestling in the rice fields.
p213
aVThe kids love it.
p214
aVThe mothers aren't quite convinced.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VWe've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives,
p219
aVand we said, okay, local, what does "local" mean?
p220
aVLocal means
p221
aVthat 20 percent of the population of the school
p222
aVhas to be Balinese,
p223
aVand this was a really big commitment.
p224
aVAnd we were right.
p225
aVAnd people are coming forward
p226
aVfrom all over the world
p227
aVto support the Balinese Scholarship Fund,
p228
aVbecause these kids will be Bali's next green leaders.
p229
aVThe teachers are as diverse
p230
aVas the student body,
p231
aVand the amazing thing
p232
aVis that volunteers are popping up.
p233
aVA man came from Java
p234
aVwith a new kind of organic agriculture.
p235
aVA woman came from Africa with music.
p236
aVAnd together these volunteers and the teachers
p237
aVare deeply committed
p238
aVto creating a new generation
p239
aVof global, green leaders.
p240
aVThe Green School effect \u2014
p241
aVwe don't know what it is.
p242
aVWe need someone to come and study it.
p243
aVBut what's happening, our learning-different kids \u2014
p244
aVdyslexic \u2014
p245
aVwe've renamed them prolexic \u2014
p246
aVare doing well in these beautiful, beautiful classrooms.
p247
aVAnd all the kids are thriving.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd how did we do all this?
p250
aVOn giant grass.
p251
aVIt's bamboo.
p252
aVIt comes out of the ground like a train.
p253
aVIt grows as high as a coconut tree in two months
p254
aVand three years later it can be harvested
p255
aVto build buildings like this.
p256
aVIt's as strong and dense as teak
p257
aVand it will hold up any roof.
p258
aVWhen the architects came, they brought us these things,
p259
aVand you've probably seen things like this.
p260
aVThe yellow box was called the administration complex.
p261
aV(Laughter)
p262
aVWe squashed it, we rethought it,
p263
aVbut mainly we renamed it
p264
aV"the heart of school,"
p265
aVand that changed everything forever.
p266
aVIt's a double helix.
p267
aVIt has administrators in it
p268
aVand many, many other things.
p269
aa(lp270
VAnd the problem of building it \u2014
p271
aVwhen the Balinese workers
p272
aVsaw long reams of plans,
p273
aVthey looked at them and said, "What's this?"
p274
aVSo we built big models.
p275
aVWe had them engineered by the engineers.
p276
aVAnd Balinese carpenters like this
p277
aVmeasured them with their bamboo rulers,
p278
aVselected the bamboo and built the buildings
p279
aVusing age-old techniques,
p280
aVmostly by hand.
p281
aVIt was chaos.
p282
aVAnd the Balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do,
p283
aVso they use metal scaffolding
p284
aVto build the bamboo building
p285
aVand when the scaffolding came down,
p286
aVwe realized that we had a cathedral,
p287
aVa cathedral to green,
p288
aVand a cathedral to green education.
p289
aVThe heart of school has seven kilometers
p290
aVof bamboo in it.
p291
aVFrom the time the foundations were finished,
p292
aVin three months it had roofs and floors.
p293
aVIt may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world,
p294
aVbut many people believe
p295
aVthat it's the most beautiful.
p296
aa(lp297
VIs this doable in your community?
p298
aVWe believe it is.
p299
aVGreen School is a model we built for the world.
p300
aVIt's a model we built for Bali.
p301
aVAnd you just have to follow these simple, simple rules:
p302
aVbe local,
p303
aVlet the environment lead
p304
aVand think about
p305
aVhow your grandchildren might build.
p306
aa(lp307
VSo, Mr. Gore, thank you.
p308
aVYou ruined my life,
p309
aVbut you gave me an incredible future.
p310
aVAnd if you're interested in being involved
p311
aVin finishing Green School
p312
aVand building the next 50 around the world,
p313
aVplease come and see us.
p314
aa(lp315
VThank you.
