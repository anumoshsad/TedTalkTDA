VDo you know
p4
aVhow many species of flowering plants there are?
p5
aVThere are a quarter of a million \u2014 at least those are the ones we know about \u2014
p6
aVa quarter of a million species of flowering plants.
p7
aVAnd flowers are a real bugger.
p8
aVThey're really difficult for plants to produce.
p9
aVThey take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.
p10
aVWhy would they go to that bother?
p11
aVAnd the answer of course, like so many things in the world,
p12
aVis sex.
p13
aVI know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures.
p14
aVAnd the reason that sexual reproduction is so important \u2014
p15
aVthere are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce.
p16
aVYou can take cuttings;
p17
aVthey can sort of have sex with themselves;
p18
aVthey can pollinate themselves.
p19
aVBut they really need to spread their genes
p20
aVto mix with other genes
p21
aVso that they can adapt to environmental niches.
p22
aVEvolution works that way.
p23
aa(lp24
VNow the way that plants transmit that information
p25
aVis through pollen.
p26
aVSome of you may have seen some of these pictures before.
p27
aVAs I say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope
p28
aVto be able to see these.
p29
aVAnd there is as many different kinds of pollen
p30
aVas there are flowering plants.
p31
aVAnd that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on.
p32
aVMost pollen that causes hay fever for us
p33
aVis from plants that use the wind
p34
aVto disseminate the pollen,
p35
aVand that's a very inefficient process,
p36
aVwhich is why it gets up our noses so much.
p37
aVBecause you have to chuck out masses and masses of it,
p38
aVhoping that your sex cells, your male sex cells,
p39
aVwhich are held within the pollen,
p40
aVwill somehow reach another flower just by chance.
p41
aVSo all the grasses, which means all of the cereal crops,
p42
aVand most of the trees
p43
aVhave wind-borne pollen.
p44
aVBut most species
p45
aVactually use insects to do their bidding,
p46
aVand that's more intelligent in a way,
p47
aVbecause the pollen, they don't need so much of it.
p48
aVThe insects
p49
aVand other species
p50
aVcan take the pollen,
p51
aVtransfer it directly to where it's required.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo we're aware, obviously, of the relationship
p54
aVbetween insects and plants.
p55
aVThere's a symbiotic relationship there,
p56
aVwhether it's flies or birds or bees,
p57
aVthey're getting something in return,
p58
aVand that something in return is generally nectar.
p59
aVSometimes that symbiosis
p60
aVhas led to wonderful adaptations \u2014
p61
aVthe hummingbird hawk-moth
p62
aVis beautiful in its adaptation.
p63
aVThe plant gets something,
p64
aVand the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.
p65
aVPlants have evolved
p66
aVto create little landing strips here and there
p67
aVfor bees that might have lost their way.
p68
aVThere are markings on many plants
p69
aVthat look like other insects.
p70
aVThese are the anthers of a lily,
p71
aVcleverly done
p72
aVso that when the unsuspecting insect
p73
aVlands on it,
p74
aVthe anther flips up and whops it on the back
p75
aVwith a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with.
p76
aVAnd there's an orchid
p77
aVthat might look to you as if it's got jaws,
p78
aVand in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out,
p79
aVgetting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else.
p80
aa(lp81
VOrchids: there are 20,000, at least,
p82
aVspecies of orchids \u2014
p83
aVamazingly, amazingly diverse.
p84
aVAnd they get up to all sorts of tricks.
p85
aVThey have to try and attract pollinators
p86
aVto do their bidding.
p87
aVThis orchid, known as Darwin's orchid,
p88
aVbecause it's one that he studied
p89
aVand made a wonderful prediction when he saw it \u2014
p90
aVyou can see that there's a very long nectar tube
p91
aVthat descends down
p92
aVfrom the orchid.
p93
aVAnd basically what the insect has to do \u2014
p94
aVwe're in the middle of the flower \u2014
p95
aVit has to stick its little proboscis
p96
aVright into the middle of that
p97
aVand all the way down that nectar tube
p98
aVto get to the nectar.
p99
aVAnd Darwin said, looking at this flower,
p100
aV"I guess something has coevolved with this."
p101
aVAnd sure enough,
p102
aVthere's the insect.
p103
aVAnd I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away,
p104
aVbut in its erect form,
p105
aVthat's what it looks like.
p106
aa(lp107
VNow you can imagine
p108
aVthat if nectar
p109
aVis such a valuable thing
p110
aVand expensive for the plant to produce
p111
aVand it attracts lots of pollinators,
p112
aVthen, just as in human sex,
p113
aVpeople might start to deceive.
p114
aVThey might say, "I've got a bit of nectar. Do you want to come and get it?"
p115
aVNow this is a plant.
p116
aVThis is a plant here
p117
aVthat insects in South Africa just love,
p118
aVand they've evolved with a long proboscis
p119
aVto get the nectar at the bottom.
p120
aVAnd this is the mimic.
p121
aVSo this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant.
p122
aVAnd here is the long-probosced fly
p123
aVthat has not gotten any nectar from the mimic,
p124
aVbecause the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some.
p125
aVSo not only has the fly
p126
aVnot got the nectar from the mimic plant,
p127
aVit's also \u2014 if you look very closely
p128
aVjust at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen
p129
aVthat it would be transmitting to another plant,
p130
aVif only some botanist hadn't come along
p131
aVand stuck it to a blue piece of card.
p132
aa(lp133
V(Laughter)
p134
aa(lp135
VNow deceit carries on through the plant kingdom.
p136
aVThis flower with its black dots:
p137
aVthey might look like black dots to us,
p138
aVbut if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species,
p139
aVthat looks like two females
p140
aVwho are really, really hot to trot.
p141
aV(Laughter)
p142
aVAnd when the insect gets there and lands on it,
p143
aVdousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant,
p144
aVif you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture,
p145
aVyou can see that there are actually some patterning there,
p146
aVwhich is three-dimensional.
p147
aVSo it probably even feels good for the insect,
p148
aVas well as looking good.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd these electron microscope pictures \u2014
p151
aVhere's one of an orchid mimicking an insect \u2014
p152
aVyou can see that different parts of the structure
p153
aVhave different colors and different textures to our eye,
p154
aVhave very, very different textures
p155
aVto what an insect might perceive.
p156
aVAnd this one is evolved to mimic
p157
aVa glossy metallic surface
p158
aVyou see on some beetles.
p159
aVAnd under the scanning electron microscope,
p160
aVyou can see the surface there \u2014
p161
aVreally quite different from the other surfaces we looked at.
p162
aVSometimes the whole plant
p163
aVmimics an insect, even to us.
p164
aVI mean, I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.
p165
aVIt's a wonderful, amazing thing.
p166
aa(lp167
VThis one's clever. It's called obsidian.
p168
aVI think of it as insidium sometimes.
p169
aVTo the right species of bee,
p170
aVthis looks like another very aggressive bee,
p171
aVand it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away,
p172
aVand, of course, covers itself with pollen.
p173
aVThe other thing it does
p174
aVis that this plant mimics another orchid
p175
aVthat has a wonderful store
p176
aVof food for insects.
p177
aVAnd this one doesn't have anything for them.
p178
aVSo it's deceiving on two levels \u2014
p179
aVfabulous.
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VHere we see ylang ylang,
p184
aVthe component of many perfumes.
p185
aVI actually smelt someone with some on earlier.
p186
aVAnd the flowers don't really have to be that gaudy.
p187
aVThey're sending out a fantastic array of scent
p188
aVto any insect that'll have it.
p189
aVThis one doesn't smell so good.
p190
aVThis is a flower
p191
aVthat really, really smells pretty nasty
p192
aVand is designed, again, evolved,
p193
aVto look like carrion.
p194
aVSo flies love this.
p195
aVThey fly in and they pollinate.
p196
aVThis, which is helicodiceros,
p197
aVis also known as dead horse arum.
p198
aVI don't know what a dead horse actually smells like,
p199
aVbut this one probably smells pretty much like it.
p200
aVIt's really horrible.
p201
aVAnd blowflies just can't help themselves.
p202
aVThey fly into this thing,
p203
aVand they fly all the way down it.
p204
aVThey lay their eggs in it,
p205
aVthinking it's a nice bit of carrion,
p206
aVand not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs are going to die,
p207
aVbut the plant, meanwhile, has benefited,
p208
aVbecause the bristles release
p209
aVand the flies disappear
p210
aVto pollinate the next flower \u2014 fantastic.
p211
aa(lp212
VHere's arum, arum maculatum,
p213
aV"lords and ladies," or "cuckoo-pint" in this country.
p214
aVI photographed this thing last week in Dorset.
p215
aVThis thing heats up
p216
aVby about 15 degrees above ambient temperature \u2014
p217
aVamazing.
p218
aVAnd if you look down into it,
p219
aVthere's this sort of dam past the spadix,
p220
aVflies get attracted by the heat \u2014
p221
aVwhich is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges \u2014
p222
aVand they get trapped underneath in this container.
p223
aVThey drink this fabulous nectar
p224
aVand then they're all a bit sticky.
p225
aVAt night they get covered in pollen,
p226
aVwhich showers down over them,
p227
aVand then the bristles that we saw above,
p228
aVthey sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen \u2014
p229
aVfabulous thing.
p230
aa(lp231
VNow if you think that's fabulous, this is one of my great favorites.
p232
aVThis is the philodendron selloum.
p233
aVFor anyone here from Brazil, you'll know about this plant.
p234
aVThis is the most amazing thing.
p235
aVThat sort of phallic bit there
p236
aVis about a foot long.
p237
aVAnd it does something
p238
aVthat no other plant that I know of does,
p239
aVand that is that when it flowers \u2014
p240
aVthat's the spadix in the middle there \u2014
p241
aVfor a period of about two days,
p242
aVit metabolizes in a way
p243
aVwhich is rather similar to mammals.
p244
aVSo instead of having starch,
p245
aVwhich is the food of plants,
p246
aVit takes something rather similar to brown fat
p247
aVand burns it at such a rate
p248
aVthat it's burning fat, metabolizing,
p249
aVabout the rate of a small cat.
p250
aVAnd that's twice the energy output, weight for weight,
p251
aVthan a hummingbird \u2014
p252
aVabsolutely astonishing.
p253
aVThis thing does something else which is unusual.
p254
aVNot only will it raise itself to 115 Fahrenheit,
p255
aV43 or 44 degrees Centigrade, for two days,
p256
aVbut it keeps constant temperature.
p257
aVThere's a thermoregulation mechanism in there
p258
aVthat keeps constant temperature.
p259
aV"Now why does it do this," I hear you ask.
p260
aVNow wouldn't you know it,
p261
aVthere's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature.
p262
aVAnd they get inside, and they get it all on.
p263
aV(Laughter)
p264
aVAnd the plant showers them with pollen,
p265
aVand off they go and pollinate.
p266
aVAnd what a wonderful thing it is.
p267
aa(lp268
VNow most pollinators
p269
aVthat we think about are insects,
p270
aVbut actually in the tropics,
p271
aVmany birds and butterflies pollinate.
p272
aVAnd many of the tropical flowers are red,
p273
aVand that's because butterflies and birds
p274
aVsee similarly to us, we think,
p275
aVand can see the color red very well.
p276
aVBut if you look at the spectrum,
p277
aVbirds and us, we see red, green and blue
p278
aVand see that spectrum.
p279
aVInsects see green, blue and ultraviolet,
p280
aVand they see various shades of ultraviolet.
p281
aVSo there's something that goes on off the end there.
p282
aV"And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is," I hear you ask.
p283
aVWell yes we can.
p284
aVSo what is an insect seeing?
p285
aVLast week I took these pictures of rock rose,
p286
aVhelianthemum, in Dorset.
p287
aVThese are little yellow flowers like we all see,
p288
aVlittle yellow flowers all over the place.
p289
aVAnd this is what it looks like with visible light.
p290
aVThis is what it looks like if you take out the red.
p291
aVMost bees don't perceive red.
p292
aVAnd then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera
p293
aVand took a very, very long exposure
p294
aVwith the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light
p295
aVand this is what I got.
p296
aVAnd that's a real fantastic bull's eye.
p297
aa(lp298
VNow we don't know
p299
aVexactly what a bee sees,
p300
aVany more than you know what I'm seeing
p301
aVwhen I call this red.
p302
aVWe can't know what's going on in \u2014 let alone an insect's \u2014
p303
aVanother human being's mind.
p304
aVBut the contrast will look something like that,
p305
aVso standing out a lot from the background.
p306
aVHere's another little flower \u2014
p307
aVdifferent range of ultraviolet frequencies,
p308
aVdifferent filters
p309
aVto match the pollinators.
p310
aVAnd that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.
p311
aVJust in case you think
p312
aVthat all yellow flowers have this property \u2014
p313
aVno flower was damaged in the process of this shot;
p314
aVit was just attached to the tripod,
p315
aVnot killed \u2014
p316
aVthen under ultraviolet light,
p317
aVlook at that.
p318
aVAnd that could be the basis of a sunscreen
p319
aVbecause sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.
p320
aVSo maybe the chemical in that would be useful.
p321
aa(lp322
VFinally, there's one of evening primrose
p323
aVthat Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me \u2014
p324
aVfantastic hidden pattern.
p325
aVAnd I love the idea of something hidden.
p326
aVI think there's something poetic here,
p327
aVthat these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter,
p328
aVthe main use of that filter
p329
aVis for astronomers to take pictures of Venus \u2014
p330
aVactually the clouds of Venus.
p331
aVThat's the main use of that filter.
p332
aVVenus, of course, is the god of love and fertility,
p333
aVwhich is the flower story.
p334
aVAnd just as flowers spend a lot of effort
p335
aVtrying to get pollinators to do their bidding,
p336
aVthey've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them
p337
aVand give them to each other
p338
aVat times of birth and death,
p339
aVand particularly at marriage,
p340
aVwhich, when you think of it,
p341
aVis the moment that encapsulates
p342
aVthe transfer of genetic material
p343
aVfrom one organism to another.
