VBasking sharks are awesome creatures.
p4
aVThey are just magnificent.
p5
aVThey grow 10 meters long; some say bigger.
p6
aVThey might weigh up to two tons.
p7
aVSome say up to five tons.
p8
aVThey're the second-largest fish in the world.
p9
aVThey're also harmless plankton-feeding animals.
p10
aVAnd they are thought to be able to filter a cubic kilometer of water every hour
p11
aVand can feed on 30 kilos of zoo plankton a day to survive.
p12
aVThey're fantastic creatures.
p13
aVWe're very lucky in Ireland,
p14
aVwe have plenty of basking sharks and plenty of opportunities to study them.
p15
aa(lp16
VThey were very important to coastal communities,
p17
aVgoing back hundreds of years,
p18
aVespecially around the Claddaghduff, Connemara region
p19
aVwhere subsistence farmers used to sail out on their hookers and open boats,
p20
aVsometimes way offshore to a place called the Sunfish Bank,
p21
aVabout 30 miles west of Achill Island,
p22
aVto kill the basking sharks.
p23
aVThis is a woodcut from about the 1800s.
p24
aa(lp25
VThey were very important, for the oil out of their liver.
p26
aVA third of the basking shark's size is their liver,
p27
aVand it's full of oil, gallons of oil.
p28
aVThat oil was used especially for lighting,
p29
aVbut also for dressing wounds and other things.
p30
aVIn fact, the streetlights in 1742,
p31
aVof Galway, Dublin and Waterford,
p32
aVwere lit with sunfish oil.
p33
aV"Sunfish" is one of the words for basking sharks.
p34
aVSo they were incredibly important animals.
p35
aVThey've been around a long time, very important to coastal communities.
p36
aa(lp37
VProbably the best-documented basking shark fishery in the world
p38
aVis that from Achill Island.
p39
aVThis is Keem Bay up in Achill Island.
p40
aVSharks used to come into the bay,
p41
aVand the fishermen would tie a net off the headland,
p42
aVstring it out, an old Manila net,
p43
aVand as the shark came round, it would hit the net,
p44
aVthe net would collapse on it.
p45
aVIt would often drown and suffocate.
p46
aVOr at times, they would row out in their small curraghs
p47
aVand kill it with a lance through the back of the neck.
p48
aVAnd then they'd tow the sharks back to Purteen Harbour,
p49
aVboil them up, use the oil.
p50
aVThey also used the flesh as well, for fertilizer
p51
aVand also would fin the sharks.
p52
aVThis is probably the biggest threat to sharks worldwide \u2014
p53
aVthe finning of sharks.
p54
aa(lp55
VWe're often frightened of sharks, thanks to "Jaws."
p56
aVMaybe five or six people get killed by sharks every year.
p57
aVThere was someone recently, wasn't there? Just a couple weeks ago.
p58
aVWe kill about 100 million sharks a year.
p59
aVSo I don't know what the balance is,
p60
aVbut I think sharks have more right to be fearful of us than we have of them.
p61
aVIt was a well-documented fishery.
p62
aVAs you can see here, it peaked in the '50s,
p63
aVwhere they were killing 1,500 sharks a year.
p64
aVAnd it declined very fast \u2014 a classic boom-and-bust fishery,
p65
aVwhich suggests that a stock has been depleted
p66
aVor there's low reproductive rates.
p67
aVThey killed about 12,000 sharks within this period,
p68
aVliterally just by stringing a Manila rope
p69
aVoff the tip of Keem Bay up in Achill Island.
p70
aa(lp71
VSharks were still killed up into the mid-80s,
p72
aVespecially out of places like Dunmore East in County Waterford.
p73
aVAbout two and a half, 3,000 sharks were killed up till '85,
p74
aVmainly by Norwegian vessels.
p75
aVYou can't really see,
p76
aVbut these are Norwegian basking shark hunting vessels.
p77
aVThe black line in the crow's nest signifies this is a shark vessel,
p78
aVrather than a whaling vessel.
p79
aa(lp80
VThe importance of basking sharks to the coast communities
p81
aVis recognized through the language.
p82
aVI don't pretend to [know many Irish words],
p83
aVbut in Kerry they were often known as "ainmhide Na seolta,"
p84
aV"the monster with the sails."
p85
aVAnother title would be "liop an dá lapa,"
p86
aV"the unwieldy beast with two fins."
p87
aV"Liabhán mór," suggesting a big animal.
p88
aVOr my favorite, "liabhán chor gréine," "the great fish of the sun."
p89
aVThat's a lovely, evocative name.
p90
aVOn Tory Island \u2014 a strange place anyway \u2014 they were known as "muldoons."
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VNo one seems to know why.
p95
aVHope there's no one from Tory here. Lovely place.
p96
aVBut more commonly all around the island, they were known as the sunfish.
p97
aVAnd this represents their habit of basking on the surface
p98
aVwhen the sun is out.
p99
aa(lp100
VThere's great concern that basking sharks are depleted
p101
aVall throughout the world.
p102
aVSome say it's not population decline,
p103
aVit might be a change in the distribution of plankton.
p104
aVIt's been suggested
p105
aVthat these sharks would make fantastic indicators of climate change,
p106
aVas they're basically continuous plankton recorders,
p107
aVswimming around with their mouth open.
p108
aVThey're now listed as vulnerable under the IUCN.
p109
aVThere's movements in Europe to try and stop catching them.
p110
aVThere's now a ban on catching and even landing them,
p111
aVeven landing ones caught accidentally.
p112
aVThey're not protected in Ireland;
p113
aVin fact, they have no legislative status in Ireland whatsoever,
p114
aVdespite our importance for the species
p115
aVand also the historical context within which basking sharks reside.
p116
aa(lp117
VWe know very little about them.
p118
aVAnd most of what we do know
p119
aVis based on their habit of coming to the surface \u2014
p120
aVwe try and guess what they're doing from their behavior on the surface.
p121
aVI only found out last year, at a conference on the Isle of Man,
p122
aVjust how unusual it is to live somewhere
p123
aVwhere basking sharks regularly, frequently and predictably
p124
aVcome to the surface to "bask."
p125
aVIt's a fantastic opportunity for a scientist
p126
aVto see and experience basking sharks.
p127
aVThey are awesome creatures.
p128
aVIt gives us a fantastic opportunity to study them, to get access to them.
p129
aa(lp130
VWhat we've been doing for a couple years \u2014 last year was a big year \u2014
p131
aVis we started tagging sharks,
p132
aVso we could try to get some idea of sight fidelity and movement
p133
aVand things like that.
p134
aVSo we concentrated mainly in North Donegal and West Kerry
p135
aVas the two areas where I was mainly active.
p136
aVAnd we tagged them very simply, not very high-tech,
p137
aVwith a big, long pole.
p138
aVThis is a beachcaster rod with a tag on the end.
p139
aVYou go up in your boat and tag the shark.
p140
aVAnd we were very effective.
p141
aVWe tagged 105 sharks last summer.
p142
aVWe got 50 in three days off Inishowen Peninsula.
p143
aa(lp144
VHalf the challenge to get access
p145
aVis to be in the right place at the right time.
p146
aVBut it's a very simple, easy technique; I'll show you what it looks like.
p147
aVWe use a pole camera on the boat to actually film the shark.
p148
aVOne, it's to try and work out the gender of the shark.
p149
aVWe also deployed some satellite tags, so we did use high-tech stuff as well.
p150
aVThese are archival tags.
p151
aVWhat they do is store the data.
p152
aVA satellite tag only works when the air is clear of the water
p153
aVand can send a signal to the satellite.
p154
aVAnd sharks and fish are underwater most of the time,
p155
aVso this tag actually works out the locations of shark,
p156
aVdepending on the timing and the setting of the sun,
p157
aVplus water temperature and depth.
p158
aVAnd you have to kind of reconstruct the path.
p159
aa(lp160
VWhat happens is,
p161
aVyou set the tag to detach from the shark after a fixed period \u2014
p162
aVin this case, eight months \u2014
p163
aVand literally to the day, the tag popped off,
p164
aVdrifted up, said hello to the satellite
p165
aVand sent, not all the data, but enough data for us to use.
p166
aVThis is the only way to really work out their behavior and movements
p167
aVwhen they're underwater.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd here's a couple of maps that we've done.
p170
aVIn that one, you can see that we tagged both off Kerry.
p171
aVBasically, it spent all its time, the last eight months, in Irish waters.
p172
aVOn Christmas, it was out on the shelf edge.
p173
aVHere's one we haven't ground-truthed yet
p174
aVwith sea-surface temperature and water depth,
p175
aVbut again, the second shark spent most of its time
p176
aVin and around the Irish Sea.
p177
aVColleagues from the Isle of Man last year actually tagged one shark
p178
aVthat went from the Isle of Man to Nova Scotia in about 90 days.
p179
aVNine and a half thousand kilometers \u2014 we never thought that happened.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnother colleague in the States tagged about 20 sharks off Massachusetts.
p182
aVHis tags didn't really work.
p183
aVAll he knows is where he tagged them,
p184
aVand where they popped off.
p185
aVHis tags popped off in the Caribbean,
p186
aVand even in Brazil.
p187
aVWe thought basking sharks were temperate animals
p188
aVand lived in our latitudes,
p189
aVbut in actual fact, they're obviously crossing the equator as well.
p190
aa(lp191
VSo very simple things like that,
p192
aVwe're trying to learn about basking sharks.
p193
aVOne thing that I think is a very surprising and strange thing
p194
aVis just how low the genetic diversity of sharks is.
p195
aVI'm not a geneticist, so I won't pretend to understand the genetics.
p196
aVAnd that's why it's great to have collaboration.
p197
aVWhereas I'm a field person,
p198
aVI get panic attacks
p199
aVif I have to spend too many hours in a lab with a white coat on.
p200
aVTake me away.
p201
aVSo we can work with geneticists who understand that.
p202
aVSo when they looked at the genetics of basking sharks,
p203
aVthey found that the diversity was incredibly low.
p204
aa(lp205
VIf you look at the first line, really,
p206
aVyou can see that all these different shark species are all quite similar.
p207
aVI think this means they're all sharks
p208
aVand they've come from a common ancestry.
p209
aVBut if you look at nucleotide diversity,
p210
aVwhich is more genetics that are passed on through the parents,
p211
aVyou see that basking sharks, if you look at the first study,
p212
aVwas order of magnitude less diverse even than other shark species.
p213
aVYou can see this work was only done in 2006.
p214
aa(lp215
VBefore 2006, we had no idea of the genetic variability of basking sharks.
p216
aVWe had no idea: Did they distinguish into different populations?
p217
aVWere there subpopulations?
p218
aVAnd that's very important if you want to know
p219
aVwhat the population size is, and the status of the animals.
p220
aVSo, Les Noble in Aberdeen kind of found this a bit unbelievable, really.
p221
aVSo he did another study using microsatellites,
p222
aVwhich is much more expensive, much more time-consuming,
p223
aVand to his surprise, came up with almost identical results.
p224
aa(lp225
VSo it does seem to be that basking sharks, for some reason,
p226
aVhave incredibly low diversity.
p227
aVAnd it's thought maybe it was a genetic bottleneck,
p228
aVthought to have been 12,000 years ago,
p229
aVand this has caused a very low diversity.
p230
aVAnd yet, if you look at the whale shark,
p231
aVwhich is the other plankton-eating large shark,
p232
aVits diversity is much greater.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo it doesn't really make sense at all.
p235
aVThey found that there was no genetic differentiation
p236
aVbetween any of the world's oceans of basking sharks:
p237
aVeven though they're found throughout the world,
p238
aVyou couldn't tell the difference, genetically,
p239
aVfrom one from the Pacific, Atlantic, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa.
p240
aVThey all basically seem the same.
p241
aVWhich, again, is kind of surprising; you wouldn't expect that.
p242
aVI don't understand or pretend to understand this;
p243
aVI suspect most geneticists don't either,
p244
aVbut they produce the numbers.
p245
aa(lp246
VSo you can actually estimate the population size
p247
aVbased on the diversity of the genetics.
p248
aVAnd Rus Hoelzel came up with an effective population size:
p249
aV8,200 animals.
p250
aVThat's it \u2014 8,000 animals in the world.
p251
aVYou're thinking, "That's ridiculous. No way."
p252
aVSo Les did a finer study,
p253
aVand he found out it came out about 9,000.
p254
aVUsing different microsatellites gave the different results,
p255
aVbut the mean of all these studies is about 5,000,
p256
aVwhich I personally don't believe.
p257
aVBut then, I am a skeptic.
p258
aVBut even if you toss a few numbers around,
p259
aVyou're probably talking an effective population of about 20,000 animals.
p260
aVDo you remember how many they killed off Achill in the 70s and the 50s?
p261
aVSo what it tells us, actually,
p262
aVis that there's actually a risk of extinction of this species
p263
aVbecause its population is so small.
p264
aVIn fact, of those 20,000,
p265
aV8,000 were thought to be females.
p266
aVThere's only 8,000 basking shark females in the world?
p267
aVI don't know. I don't believe it.
p268
aa(lp269
VThe problem with this is they were constrained with samples.
p270
aVThey didn't get enough samples
p271
aVto really explore the genetics in enough detail.
p272
aVSo, where do you get samples from for your genetic analysis?
p273
aVWell, one obvious source is dead sharks \u2014
p274
aVdead sharks, washed up.
p275
aVWe might get two or three dead sharks washed up in Ireland a year,
p276
aVif we're kind of lucky.
p277
aVAnother source would be fisheries' bycatch.
p278
aVWe were getting quite a few caught in surface drift nets.
p279
aVThat's banned now, and that'll be good news for the sharks.
p280
aVAnd some are caught in nets, in trawls.
p281
aVThis is a shark that was actually landed in Howth just before Christmas \u2014
p282
aVillegally, because you're not allowed to do that under EU law \u2014
p283
aVand was actually sold for eight euros a kilo as shark steak.
p284
aVThey even put a recipe up on the wall,
p285
aVuntil they were told it was illegal.
p286
aVThey actually did get a fine for that.
p287
aa(lp288
VSo if you look at all those studies I showed you,
p289
aVthe total number of samples worldwide
p290
aVis 86, at present.
p291
aVSo it's very important work,
p292
aVand they can ask some really good questions,
p293
aVand tell us about population size and subpopulations and structure,
p294
aVbut they're constrained by lack of samples.
p295
aa(lp296
VWhen we were out tagging our sharks \u2014
p297
aVthis is how we tagged them on the front of a RIB, get in there fast \u2014
p298
aVoccasionally, the sharks do react.
p299
aVOn one occasion, when we were up in Malin Head in Donegal,
p300
aVthe shark smacked the side of the boat with his tail,
p301
aVmore, I think, in startle to the fact that a boat came near it,
p302
aVrather than the tag going in.
p303
aVAnd that was fine. We got wet. No problem.
p304
aVAnd then when myself and Emmett got back to Malin Head, to the pier,
p305
aVI noticed some black slime on the front of the boat.
p306
aVI used to spend a lot of time on commercial fishing boats,
p307
aVand I remember fishermen saying
p308
aVthey can tell when a basking shark has been caught in a net,
p309
aVbecause it leaves a black slime behind.
p310
aVSo that must have come from the shark.
p311
aa(lp312
VNow, we had an interest in getting tissue samples for genetics
p313
aVbecause we knew they were very valuable.
p314
aVWe would use conventional methods;
p315
aVI have a crossbow \u2014 you see it in my hand there,
p316
aVwhich we use to sample whales and dolphins for genetic studies as well.
p317
aVSo I tried that, I tried many techniques.
p318
aVAll it was doing was breaking my arrows,
p319
aVbecause the shark's skin is just so strong.
p320
aVThere was no way we were going to get a sample from that.
p321
aVThat wasn't going to work.
p322
aa(lp323
VSo when I saw the black slime on the bow of the boat,
p324
aVI thought, "If you take what you're given in this world ..."
p325
aVSo I scraped it off.
p326
aVI had a little tube with alcohol in it to send to the geneticists.
p327
aVSo I scraped the slime off and sent it to Aberdeen,
p328
aVand said, "You might try that."
p329
aVAnd they sat on it for months.
p330
aVIt was only because we had a conference on the Isle of Man.
p331
aVBut I kept emailing Les, saying,
p332
aV"Have you had a chance to look at my slime?"
p333
aVAnd he was like, "Yeah, yeah. Later."
p334
aVHe thought he'd better do it because I never met him before;
p335
aVhe might lose face if he hadn't done the thing I sent him.
p336
aa(lp337
VAnd he was amazed that they actually got DNA from the slime.
p338
aVThey amplified it and they tested it,
p339
aVand they found, yes, this was actually basking shark DNA,
p340
aVwhich was got from the slime.
p341
aVSo he was very excited.
p342
aVIt became known as "Simon's shark slime."
p343
aVAnd I thought, "Hey, you know, I can build on this."
p344
aVSo we thought, OK, we're going to try to get out and get some slime.
p345
aVSo having spent three-and-a-half thousand on satellite tags ...
p346
aVI then thought I'd invest 7.95 \u2014 the price is still on it \u2014
p347
aVin my local hardware store in Kilrush
p348
aVfor a mop handle,
p349
aVand even less money on some oven cleaners.
p350
aVAnd I wrapped the oven cleaner around the edge of the mop handle
p351
aVand ...
p352
aa(lp353
V(Laughter)
p354
aa(lp355
VI was desperate to have an opportunity to get some sharks.
p356
aVAnd this was into August now, and normally sharks peak in June, July,
p357
aVand you rarely see them, or rarely can be in the right place
p358
aVto find sharks into August.
p359
aVWe were desperate, so we rushed out to the Blaskets
p360
aVas soon as we heard there were sharks there,
p361
aVand managed to find some sharks.
p362
aVSo by just rubbing the mop handle down the shark
p363
aVas it swam under the boat \u2014
p364
aVyou see a shark running under the boat here \u2014
p365
aVwe managed to collect slime.
p366
aVAnd here it is.
p367
aVLook at that lovely black shark slime.
p368
aVAnd in about half an hour, we got five samples.
p369
aVFive individual sharks were sampled
p370
aVusing Simon's Shark Slime Sampling System.
p371
aa(lp372
V(Laughter)
p373
aa(lp374
V(Applause)
p375
aa(lp376
VI've been working on whales and dolphins in Ireland for 20 years now,
p377
aVand they're a bit more dramatic.
p378
aVYou probably saw the humpback whale footage
p379
aVwe got a month or two ago off County Wexford.
p380
aVAnd you always think you might have some legacy
p381
aVyou can leave the world behind,
p382
aVand I was thinking of humpback whales breaching and dolphins.
p383
aVBut hey \u2014 sometimes these things are sent to you
p384
aVand you just have to take them when they come.
p385
aVSo this is possibly going to be my legacy \u2014
p386
aVSimon's Shark Slime.
p387
aa(lp388
VWe got more money this year
p389
aVto carry on collecting more and more samples.
p390
aVOne thing that is very useful is that we use a pole camera \u2014
p391
aVthis is my colleague, Joanne, with a pole camera \u2014
p392
aVwhere you can look underneath the shark.
p393
aVWhat you're trying to look at is, the males have claspers,
p394
aVwhich kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark.
p395
aVSo you can quite easily tell the gender of the shark.
p396
aVIf we can tell the gender of the shark before we sample it,
p397
aVwe can tell the geneticist this was taken from a male or a female.
p398
aVBecause in the moment, they have no way, genetically,
p399
aVof telling the difference between a male and a female,
p400
aVwhich I find staggering,
p401
aVbecause they don't know what primers to look for.
p402
aVBeing able to tell the gender of a shark
p403
aVis very important for things like policing the trade
p404
aVin basking shark and other species through the sightings,
p405
aVbecause it is illegal to trade in these sharks.
p406
aVAnd they are caught and are on the market.
p407
aa(lp408
VSo as a field biologist,
p409
aVyou just want to get encounters with these animals,
p410
aVand learn as much as you can.
p411
aVThey're often quite brief, they're often very seasonally constrained.
p412
aVYou just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can.
p413
aVBut isn't it fantastic
p414
aVthat you can then offer these samples and opportunities
p415
aVto other disciplines, such as the geneticists,
p416
aVwho can gain so much more from that.
p417
aa(lp418
VSo as I said, these things are sent to you in strange ways.
p419
aVGrab them while you can.
p420
