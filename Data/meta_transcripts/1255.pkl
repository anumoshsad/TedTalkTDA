VThank you.
p4
aVIt's a real pleasure to be here.
p5
aVI last did a TED Talk
p6
aVI think about seven years ago or so.
p7
aVI talked about spaghetti sauce.
p8
aVAnd so many people, I guess, watch those videos.
p9
aVPeople have been coming up to me ever since
p10
aVto ask me questions about spaghetti sauce,
p11
aVwhich is a wonderful thing in the short term \u2014
p12
aV(Laughter)
p13
aVbut it's proven to be less than ideal
p14
aVover seven years.
p15
aVAnd so I though I would come
p16
aVand try and put spaghetti sauce behind me.
p17

aa(lp20
VThe theme of this morning's session is Things We Make.
p21
aVAnd so I thought I would tell a story
p22
aVabout someone
p23
aVwho made one of the most precious objects
p24
aVof his era.
p25
aVAnd the man's name is Carl Norden.
p26
aVCarl Norden was born in 1880.
p27
aVAnd he was Swiss.
p28
aVAnd of course, the Swiss can be divided
p29
aVinto two general categories:
p30
aVthose who make small, exquisite,
p31
aVexpensive objects
p32
aVand those who handle the money
p33
aVof those who buy small, exquisite,
p34
aVexpensive objects.
p35
aVAnd Carl Norden is very firmly in the former camp.
p36
aVHe's an engineer.
p37
aVHe goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich.
p38
aVIn fact, one of his classmates is a young man named Lenin
p39
aVwho would go on
p40
aVto break small, expensive, exquisite objects.
p41
aa(lp42
VAnd he's a Swiss engineer, Carl.
p43
aVAnd I mean that in its fullest sense of the word.
p44
aVHe wears three-piece suits;
p45
aVand he has a very, very small, important mustache;
p46
aVand he is domineering
p47
aVand narcissistic
p48
aVand driven
p49
aVand has an extraordinary ego;
p50
aVand he works 16-hour days;
p51
aVand he has very strong feelings about alternating current;
p52
aVand he feels like a suntan is a sign of moral weakness;
p53
aVand he drinks lots of coffee;
p54
aVand he does his best work
p55
aVsitting in his mother's kitchen in Zurich for hours
p56
aVin complete silence
p57
aVwith nothing but a slide rule.
p58
aa(lp59
VIn any case,
p60
aVCarl Norden emigrates to the United States
p61
aVjust before the First World War
p62
aVand sets up shop on Lafayette Street
p63
aVin downtown Manhattan.
p64
aVAnd he becomes obsessed with the question
p65
aVof how to drop bombs from an airplane.
p66
aVNow if you think about it,
p67
aVin the age before GPS and radar,
p68
aVthat was obviously a really difficult problem.
p69
aVIt's a complicated physics problem.
p70
aVYou've got a plane that's thousands of feet up in the air,
p71
aVgoing at hundreds of miles an hour,
p72
aVand you're trying to drop an object, a bomb,
p73
aVtowards some stationary target
p74
aVin the face of all kinds of winds and cloud cover
p75
aVand all kinds of other impediments.
p76
aVAnd all sorts of people,
p77
aVmoving up to the First World War and between the wars,
p78
aVtried to solve this problem,
p79
aVand nearly everybody came up short.
p80
aVThe bombsights that were available
p81
aVwere incredibly crude.
p82
aa(lp83
VBut Carl Norden is really the one who cracks the code.
p84
aVAnd he comes up with this incredibly complicated device.
p85
aVIt weighs about 50 lbs.
p86
aVIt's called the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.
p87
aVAnd it has all kinds of levers and ball-bearings
p88
aVand gadgets and gauges.
p89
aVAnd he makes this complicated thing.
p90
aVAnd what he allows people to do
p91
aVis he makes the bombardier take this particular object,
p92
aVvisually sight the target,
p93
aVbecause they're in the Plexiglas cone of the bomber,
p94
aVand then they plug in the altitude of the plane,
p95
aVthe speed of the plane, the speed of the wind
p96
aVand the coordinates
p97
aVof the target.
p98
aVAnd the bombsight will tell him when to drop the bomb.
p99
aVAnd as Norden famously says,
p100
aV"Before that bombsight came along,
p101
aVbombs would routinely miss their target
p102
aVby a mile or more."
p103
aVBut he said, with the Mark 15 Norden bombsight,
p104
aVhe could drop a bomb into a pickle barrel
p105
aVat 20,000 ft.
p106
aa(lp107
VNow I cannot tell you
p108
aVhow incredibly excited
p109
aVthe U.S. military was
p110
aVby the news of the Norden bombsight.
p111
aVIt was like manna from heaven.
p112
aVHere was an army
p113
aVthat had just had experience in the First World War,
p114
aVwhere millions of men
p115
aVfought each other in the trenches,
p116
aVgetting nowhere, making no progress,
p117
aVand here someone had come up with a device
p118
aVthat allowed them to fly up in the skies
p119
aVhigh above enemy territory
p120
aVand destroy whatever they wanted
p121
aVwith pinpoint accuracy.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd the U.S. military
p124
aVspends 1.5 billion dollars \u2014
p125
aVbillion dollars in 1940 dollars \u2014
p126
aVdeveloping the Norden bombsight.
p127
aVAnd to put that in perspective,
p128
aVthe total cost of the Manhattan project
p129
aVwas three billion dollars.
p130
aVHalf as much money was spent on this Norden bombsight
p131
aVas was spent on the most famous military-industrial project
p132
aVof the modern era.
p133
aVAnd there were people, strategists, within the U.S. military
p134
aVwho genuinely thought that this single device
p135
aVwas going to spell the difference
p136
aVbetween defeat and victory
p137
aVwhen it came to the battle against the Nazis
p138
aVand against the Japanese.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd for Norden as well,
p141
aVthis device had incredible moral importance,
p142
aVbecause Norden was a committed Christian.
p143
aVIn fact, he would always get upset
p144
aVwhen people referred to the bombsight as his invention,
p145
aVbecause in his eyes,
p146
aVonly God could invent things.
p147
aVHe was simply the instrument of God's will.
p148
aVAnd what was God's will?
p149
aVWell God's will was that the amount of suffering in any kind of war
p150
aVbe reduced to as small an amount as possible.
p151
aa(lp152
VAnd what did the Norden bombsight do?
p153
aVWell it allowed you to do that.
p154
aVIt allowed you to bomb only those things
p155
aVthat you absolutely needed and wanted to bomb.
p156
aVSo in the years leading up to the Second World War,
p157
aVthe U.S. military buys 90,000
p158
aVof these Norden bombsights
p159
aVat a cost of $14,000 each \u2014
p160
aVagain, in 1940 dollars, that's a lot of money.
p161
aVAnd they trained 50,000 bombardiers on how to use them \u2014
p162
aVlong extensive, months-long training sessions \u2014
p163
aVbecause these things are essentially analog computers;
p164
aVthey're not easy to use.
p165
aVAnd they make every one of those bombardiers take an oath,
p166
aVto swear that if they're ever captured,
p167
aVthey will not divulge a single detail
p168
aVof this particular device to the enemy,
p169
aVbecause it's imperative the enemy not get their hands
p170
aVon this absolutely essential piece of technology.
p171
aa(lp172
VAnd whenever the Norden bombsight is taken onto a plane,
p173
aVit's escorted there by a series of armed guards.
p174
aVAnd it's carried in a box with a canvas shroud over it.
p175
aVAnd the box is handcuffed to one of the guards.
p176
aVIt's never allowed to be photographed.
p177
aVAnd there's a little incendiary device inside of it,
p178
aVso that, if the plane ever crashes, it will be destroyed
p179
aVand there's no way the enemy can ever get their hands on it.
p180
aVThe Norden bombsight
p181
aVis the Holy Grail.
p182
aa(lp183
VSo what happens during the Second World War?
p184
aVWell, it turns out it's not the Holy Grail.
p185
aVIn practice, the Norden bombsight
p186
aVcan drop a bomb into a pickle barrel at 20,000 ft.,
p187
aVbut that's under perfect conditions.
p188
aVAnd of course, in wartime,
p189
aVconditions aren't perfect.
p190
aVFirst of all, it's really hard to use \u2014 really hard to use.
p191
aVAnd not all of the people
p192
aVwho are of those 50,000 men who are bombardiers
p193
aVhave the ability to properly program an analog computer.
p194
aVSecondly, it breaks down a lot.
p195
aVIt's full of all kinds of gyroscopes and pulleys
p196
aVand gadgets and ball-bearings,
p197
aVand they don't work as well as they ought to
p198
aVin the heat of battle.
p199
aa(lp200
VThirdly, when Norden was making his calculations,
p201
aVhe assumed that a plane would be flying
p202
aVat a relatively slow speed at low altitudes.
p203
aVWell in a real war, you can't do that;
p204
aVyou'll get shot down.
p205
aVSo they started flying them at high altitudes at incredibly high speeds.
p206
aVAnd the Norden bombsight doesn't work as well
p207
aVunder those conditions.
p208
aa(lp209
VBut most of all,
p210
aVthe Norden bombsight required the bombardier
p211
aVto make visual contact with the target.
p212
aVBut of course, what happens in real life?
p213
aVThere are clouds, right.
p214
aVIt needs cloudless sky to be really accurate.
p215
aVWell how many cloudless skies
p216
aVdo you think there were above Central Europe
p217
aVbetween 1940 and 1945?
p218
aVNot a lot.
p219
aa(lp220
VAnd then to give you a sense
p221
aVof just how inaccurate the Norden bombsight was,
p222
aVthere was a famous case in 1944
p223
aVwhere the Allies bombed a chemical plant in Leuna, Germany.
p224
aVAnd the chemical plant comprised
p225
aV757 acres.
p226
aVAnd over the course of 22 bombing missions,
p227
aVthe Allies dropped 85,000 bombs
p228
aVon this 757 acre chemical plant,
p229
aVusing the Norden bombsight.
p230
aVWell what percentage of those bombs
p231
aVdo you think actually landed
p232
aVinside the 700-acre perimeter of the plant?
p233
aV10 percent. 10 percent.
p234
aVAnd of those 10 percent that landed,
p235
aV16 percent didn't even go off; they were duds.
p236
aVThe Leuna chemical plant,
p237
aVafter one of the most extensive bombings in the history of the war,
p238
aVwas up and running within weeks.
p239
aa(lp240
VAnd by the way, all those precautions
p241
aVto keep the Norden bombsight out of the hands of the Nazis?
p242
aVWell it turns out
p243
aVthat Carl Norden, as a proper Swiss,
p244
aVwas very enamored of German engineers.
p245
aVSo in the 1930s, he hired a whole bunch of them,
p246
aVincluding a man named Hermann Long
p247
aVwho, in 1938,
p248
aVgave a complete set of the plans for the Norden bombsight to the Nazis.
p249
aVSo they had their own Norden bombsight throughout the entire war \u2014
p250
aVwhich also, by the way, didn't work very well.
p251
aa(lp252
V(Laughter)
p253
aa(lp254
VSo why do we talk about the Norden bombsight?
p255
aVWell because we live in an age
p256
aVwhere there are lots and lots
p257
aVof Norden bombsights.
p258
aVWe live in a time where there are all kinds
p259
aVof really, really smart people
p260
aVrunning around, saying that they've invented gadgets
p261
aVthat will forever change our world.
p262
aVThey've invented websites that will allow people to be free.
p263
aVThey've invented some kind of this thing, or this thing, or this thing
p264
aVthat will make our world forever better.
p265
aa(lp266
VIf you go into the military,
p267
aVyou'll find lots of Carl Nordens as well.
p268
aVIf you go to the Pentagon, they will say,
p269
aV"You know what, now we really can
p270
aVput a bomb inside a pickle barrel
p271
aVat 20,000 ft."
p272
aVAnd you know what, it's true; they actually can do that now.
p273
aVBut we need to be very clear
p274
aVabout how little that means.
p275
aa(lp276
VIn the Iraq War, at the beginning of the first Iraq War,
p277
aVthe U.S. military, the air force,
p278
aVsent two squadrons of F-15E Fighter Eagles
p279
aVto the Iraqi desert
p280
aVequipped with these five million dollar cameras
p281
aVthat allowed them to see the entire desert floor.
p282
aVAnd their mission was to find and to destroy \u2014
p283
aVremember the Scud missile launchers,
p284
aVthose surface-to-air missiles
p285
aVthat the Iraqis were launching at the Israelis?
p286
aVThe mission of the two squadrons
p287
aVwas to get rid of all the Scud missile launchers.
p288
aVAnd so they flew missions day and night,
p289
aVand they dropped thousands of bombs,
p290
aVand they fired thousands of missiles
p291
aVin an attempt to get rid of this particular scourge.
p292
aa(lp293
VAnd after the war was over, there was an audit done \u2014
p294
aVas the army always does, the air force always does \u2014
p295
aVand they asked the question:
p296
aVhow many Scuds did we actually destroy?
p297
aVYou know what the answer was?
p298
aVZero, not a single one.
p299
aVNow why is that?
p300
aVIs it because their weapons weren't accurate?
p301
aVOh no, they were brilliantly accurate.
p302
aVThey could have destroyed this little thing right here
p303
aVfrom 25,000 ft.
p304
aVThe issue was they didn't know where the Scud launchers were.
p305
aVThe problem with bombs and pickle barrels
p306
aVis not getting the bomb inside the pickle barrel,
p307
aVit's knowing how to find the pickle barrel.
p308
aVThat's always been the harder problem
p309
aVwhen it comes to fighting wars.
p310
aa(lp311
VOr take the battle in Afghanistan.
p312
aVWhat is the signature weapon
p313
aVof the CIA's war in Northwest Pakistan?
p314
aVIt's the drone. What is the drone?
p315
aVWell it is the grandson of the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.
p316
aVIt is this weapon of devastating accuracy and precision.
p317
aVAnd over the course of the last six years
p318
aVin Northwest Pakistan,
p319
aVthe CIA has flown hundreds of drone missiles,
p320
aVand it's used those drones
p321
aVto kill 2,000 suspected
p322
aVPakistani and Taliban militants.
p323
aVNow what is the accuracy of those drones?
p324
aVWell it's extraordinary.
p325
aVWe think we're now at 95 percent accuracy
p326
aVwhen it comes to drone strikes.
p327
aV95 percent of the people we kill need to be killed, right?
p328
aVThat is one of the most extraordinary records
p329
aVin the history of modern warfare.
p330
aa(lp331
VBut do you know what the crucial thing is?
p332
aVIn that exact same period
p333
aVthat we've been using these drones
p334
aVwith devastating accuracy,
p335
aVthe number of attacks, of suicide attacks and terrorist attacks,
p336
aVagainst American forces in Afghanistan
p337
aVhas increased tenfold.
p338
aVAs we have gotten more and more efficient
p339
aVin killing them,
p340
aVthey have become angrier and angrier
p341
aVand more and more motivated to kill us.
p342
aVI have not described to you a success story.
p343
aVI've described to you
p344
aVthe opposite of a success story.
p345
aa(lp346
VAnd this is the problem
p347
aVwith our infatuation with the things we make.
p348
aVWe think the things we make can solve our problems,
p349
aVbut our problems are much more complex than that.
p350
aVThe issue isn't the accuracy of the bombs you have,
p351
aVit's how you use the bombs you have,
p352
aVand more importantly,
p353
aVwhether you ought to use bombs at all.
p354
aa(lp355
VThere's a postscript
p356
aVto the Norden story
p357
aVof Carl Norden and his fabulous bombsight.
p358
aVAnd that is, on August 6, 1945,
p359
aVa B-29 bomber called the Enola Gay
p360
aVflew over Japan
p361
aVand, using a Norden bombsight,
p362
aVdropped a very large thermonuclear device
p363
aVon the city of Hiroshima.
p364
aVAnd as was typical with the Norden bombsight,
p365
aVthe bomb actually missed its target by 800 ft.
p366
aVBut of course, it didn't matter.
p367
aVAnd that's the greatest irony of all
p368
aVwhen it comes to the Norden bombsight.
p369
aVthe air force's 1.5 billion dollar bombsight
p370
aVwas used to drop its three billion dollar bomb,
p371
aVwhich didn't need a bombsight at all.
p372
aa(lp373
VMeanwhile, back in New York,
p374
aVno one told Carl Norden
p375
aVthat his bombsight was used over Hiroshima.
p376
aVHe was a committed Christian.
p377
aVHe thought he had designed something
p378
aVthat would reduce the toll of suffering in war.
p379
aVIt would have broken his heart.
