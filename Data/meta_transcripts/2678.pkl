VTom Stranger: In 1996, when I was 18 years old,
p7
aVI had the golden opportunity to go on an international exchange program.
p8
aVIronically I'm an Australian who prefers proper icy cold weather,
p9
aVso I was both excited and tearful when I got on a plane to Iceland,
p10
aVafter just having farewelled my parents and brothers goodbye.
p11
aVI was welcomed into the home of a beautiful Icelandic family
p12
aVwho took me hiking,
p13
aVand helped me get a grasp of the melodic Icelandic language.
p14
aVI struggled a bit with the initial period of homesickness.
p15
aVI snowboarded after school,
p16
aVand I slept a lot.
p17
aVTwo hours of chemistry class in a language that you don't yet fully understand
p18
aVcan be a pretty good sedative.
p19
aa(lp20
V(Laughter)
p21
aa(lp22
VMy teacher recommended I try out for the school play,
p23
aVjust to get me a bit more socially active.
p24
aVIt turns out I didn't end up being part of the play,
p25
aVbut through it I met Thordis.
p26
aVWe shared a lovely teenage romance,
p27
aVand we'd meet at lunchtimes to just hold hands
p28
aVand walk around old downtown Reykjavík.
p29
aVI met her welcoming family, and she met my friends.
p30
aVWe'd been in a budding relationship for a bit over a month
p31
aVwhen our school's Christmas Ball was held.
p32
aa(lp33
VThordis Elva: I was 16 and in love for the first time.
p34
aVGoing together to the Christmas dance
p35
aVwas a public confirmation of our relationship,
p36
aVand I felt like the luckiest girl in the world.
p37
aVNo longer a child, but a young woman.
p38
aVHigh on my newfound maturity,
p39
aVI felt it was only natural to try drinking rum for the first time that night, too.
p40
aVThat was a bad idea.
p41
aVI became very ill,
p42
aVdrifting in and out of consciousness
p43
aVin between spasms of convulsive vomiting.
p44
aVThe security guards wanted to call me an ambulance,
p45
aVbut Tom acted as my knight in shining armor,
p46
aVand told them he'd take me home.
p47
aa(lp48
VIt was like a fairy tale,
p49
aVhis strong arms around me,
p50
aVlaying me in the safety of my bed.
p51
aVBut the gratitude that I felt towards him soon turned to horror
p52
aVas he proceeded to take off my clothes and get on top of me.
p53
aVMy head had cleared up,
p54
aVbut my body was still too weak to fight back,
p55
aVand the pain was blinding.
p56
aVI thought I'd be severed in two.
p57
aVIn order to stay sane,
p58
aVI silently counted the seconds on my alarm clock.
p59
aVAnd ever since that night,
p60
aVI've known that there are 7,200 seconds in two hours.
p61
aa(lp62
VDespite limping for days and crying for weeks,
p63
aVthis incident didn't fit my ideas about rape like I'd seen on TV.
p64
aVTom wasn't an armed lunatic;
p65
aVhe was my boyfriend.
p66
aVAnd it didn't happen in a seedy alleyway,
p67
aVit happened in my own bed.
p68
aVBy the time I could identify what had happened to me as rape,
p69
aVhe had completed his exchange program
p70
aVand left for Australia.
p71
aVSo I told myself it was pointless to address what had happened.
p72
aVAnd besides,
p73
aVit had to have been my fault, somehow.
p74
aa(lp75
VI was raised in a world where girls are taught
p76
aVthat they get raped for a reason.
p77
aVTheir skirt was too short,
p78
aVtheir smile was too wide,
p79
aVtheir breath smelled of alcohol.
p80
aVAnd I was guilty of all of those things,
p81
aVso the shame had to be mine.
p82
aVIt took me years to realize
p83
aVthat only one thing could have stopped me from being raped that night,
p84
aVand it wasn't my skirt,
p85
aVit wasn't my smile,
p86
aVit wasn't my childish trust.
p87
aVThe only thing that could've stopped me from being raped that night
p88
aVis the man who raped me \u2014
p89
aVhad he stopped himself.
p90
aa(lp91
VTS: I have vague memories of the next day:
p92
aVthe after effects of drinking,
p93
aVa certain hollowness that I tried to stifle.
p94
aVNothing more.
p95
aVBut I didn't show up at Thordis's door.
p96
aVIt is important to now state
p97
aVthat I didn't see my deed for what it was.
p98
aVThe word "rape" didn't echo around my mind as it should've,
p99
aVand I wasn't crucifying myself with memories of the night before.
p100
aVIt wasn't so much a conscious refusal,
p101
aVit was more like any acknowledgment of reality was forbidden.
p102
aVMy definition of my actions completely refuted any recognition
p103
aVof the immense trauma I caused Thordis.
p104
aVTo be honest,
p105
aVI repudiated the entire act in the days afterwards
p106
aVand when I was committing it.
p107
aVI disavowed the truth by convincing myself it was sex and not rape.
p108
aVAnd this is a lie I've felt spine-bending guilt for.
p109
aa(lp110
VI broke up with Thordis a couple of days later,
p111
aVand then saw her a number of times
p112
aVduring the remainder of my year in Iceland,
p113
aVfeeling a sharp stab of heavyheartedness each time.
p114
aVDeep down, I knew I'd done something immeasurably wrong.
p115
aVBut without planning it, I sunk the memories deep,
p116
aVand then I tied a rock to them.
p117
aa(lp118
VWhat followed is a nine-year period
p119
aVthat can best be titled as "Denial and Running."
p120
aVWhen I got a chance to identify the real torment that I caused,
p121
aVI didn't stand still long enough to do so.
p122
aVWhether it be via distraction,
p123
aVsubstance use,
p124
aVthrill-seeking
p125
aVor the scrupulous policing of my inner speak,
p126
aVI refused to be static and silent.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd with this noise,
p129
aVI also drew heavily upon other parts of my life
p130
aVto construct a picture of who I was.
p131
aVI was a surfer,
p132
aVa social science student,
p133
aVa friend to good people,
p134
aVa loved brother and son,
p135
aVan outdoor recreation guide,
p136
aVand eventually, a youth worker.
p137
aVI gripped tight to the simple notion that I wasn't a bad person.
p138
aVI didn't think I had this in my bones.
p139
aVI thought I was made up of something else.
p140
aVIn my nurtured upbringing,
p141
aVmy loving extended family and role models,
p142
aVpeople close to me were warm and genuine
p143
aVin their respect shown towards women.
p144
aVIt took me a long time to stare down this dark corner of myself,
p145
aVand to ask it questions.
p146
aa(lp147
VTE: Nine years after the Christmas dance,
p148
aVI was 25 years old,
p149
aVand headed straight for a nervous breakdown.
p150
aVMy self-worth was buried under a soul-crushing load of silence
p151
aVthat isolated me from everyone that I cared about,
p152
aVand I was consumed with misplaced hatred and anger
p153
aVthat I took out on myself.
p154
aa(lp155
VOne day, I stormed out of the door in tears
p156
aVafter a fight with a loved one,
p157
aVand I wandered into a café,
p158
aVwhere I asked the waitress for a pen.
p159
aVI always had a notebook with me,
p160
aVclaiming that it was to jot down ideas in moments of inspiration,
p161
aVbut the truth was that I needed to be constantly fidgeting,
p162
aVbecause in moments of stillness,
p163
aVI found myself counting seconds again.
p164
aVBut that day, I watched in wonder as the words streamed out of my pen,
p165
aVforming the most pivotal letter I've ever written,
p166
aVaddressed to Tom.
p167
aVAlong with an account of the violence that he subjected me to,
p168
aVthe words, "I want to find forgiveness"
p169
aVstared back at me,
p170
aVsurprising nobody more than myself.
p171
aVBut deep down I realized that this was my way out of my suffering,
p172
aVbecause regardless of whether or not he deserved my forgiveness,
p173
aVI deserved peace.
p174
aVMy era of shame was over.
p175
aa(lp176
VBefore sending the letter,
p177
aVI prepared myself for all kinds of negative responses,
p178
aVor what I found likeliest: no response whatsoever.
p179
aVThe only outcome that I didn't prepare myself for
p180
aVwas the one that I then got \u2014
p181
aVa typed confession from Tom, full of disarming regret.
p182
aVAs it turns out, he, too, had been imprisoned by silence.
p183
aVAnd this marked the start of an eight-year-long correspondence
p184
aVthat God knows was never easy,
p185
aVbut always honest.
p186
aVI relieved myself of the burdens that I'd wrongfully shouldered,
p187
aVand he, in turn, wholeheartedly owned up to what he'd done.
p188
aVOur written exchanges became a platform
p189
aVto dissect the consequences of that night,
p190
aVand they were everything from gut-wrenching
p191
aVto healing beyond words.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd yet, it didn't bring about closure for me.
p194
aVPerhaps because the email format didn't feel personal enough,
p195
aVperhaps because it's easy to be brave
p196
aVwhen you're hiding behind a computer screen on the other side of the planet.
p197
aVBut we'd begun a dialogue
p198
aVthat I felt was necessary to explore to its fullest.
p199
aVSo, after eight years of writing,
p200
aVand nearly 16 years after that dire night,
p201
aVI mustered the courage to propose a wild idea:
p202
aVthat we'd meet up in person
p203
aVand face our past once and for all.
p204
aa(lp205
VTS: Iceland and Australia are geographically like this.
p206
aVIn the middle of the two is South Africa.
p207
aVWe decided upon the city of Cape Town,
p208
aVand there we met for one week.
p209
aVThe city itself proved to be a stunningly powerful environment
p210
aVto focus on reconciliation and forgiveness.
p211
aVNowhere else has healing and rapprochement been tested
p212
aVlike it has in South Africa.
p213
aVAs a nation, South Africa sought to sit within the truth of its past,
p214
aVand to listen to the details of its history.
p215
aVKnowing this only magnified the effect that Cape Town had on us.
p216
aa(lp217
VOver the course of this week,
p218
aVwe literally spoke our life stories to each other,
p219
aVfrom start to finish.
p220
aVAnd this was about analyzing our own history.
p221
aVWe followed a strict policy of being honest,
p222
aVand this also came with a certain exposure,
p223
aVan open-chested vulnerability.
p224
aVThere were gutting confessions,
p225
aVand moments where we just absolutely couldn't fathom
p226
aVthe other person's experience.
p227
aVThe seismic effects of sexual violence were spoken aloud and felt,
p228
aVface to face.
p229
aVAt other times, though,
p230
aVwe found a soaring clarity,
p231
aVand even some totally unexpected but liberating laughter.
p232
aVWhen it came down to it,
p233
aVwe did out best to listen to each other intently.
p234
aVAnd our individual realities were aired with an unfiltered purity
p235
aVthat couldn't do any less than lighten the soul.
p236
aa(lp237
VTE: Wanting to take revenge is a very human emotion \u2014
p238
aVinstinctual, even.
p239
aVAnd all I wanted to do for years
p240
aVwas to hurt Tom back as deeply as he had hurt me.
p241
aVBut had I not found a way out of the hatred and anger,
p242
aVI'm not sure I'd be standing here today.
p243
aVThat isn't to say that I didn't have my doubts along the way.
p244
aVWhen the plane bounced on that landing strip in Cape Town,
p245
aVI remember thinking,
p246
aV"Why did I not just get myself a therapist and a bottle of vodka
p247
aVlike a normal person would do?"
p248
aa(lp249
V(Laughter)
p250
aa(lp251
VAt times, our search for understanding in Cape Town
p252
aVfelt like an impossible quest,
p253
aVand all I wanted to do was to give up
p254
aVand go home to my loving husband, Vidir,
p255
aVand our son.
p256
aVBut despite our difficulties,
p257
aVthis journey did result in a victorious feeling
p258
aVthat light had triumphed over darkness,
p259
aVthat something constructive could be built out of the ruins.
p260
aa(lp261
VI read somewhere
p262
aVthat you should try and be the person that you needed when you were younger.
p263
aVAnd back when I was a teenager,
p264
aVI would have needed to know that the shame wasn't mine,
p265
aVthat there's hope after rape,
p266
aVthat you can even find happiness,
p267
aVlike I share with my husband today.
p268
aVWhich is why I started writing feverishly upon my return from Cape Town,
p269
aVresulting in a book co-authored by Tom,
p270
aVthat we hope can be of use to people from both ends
p271
aVof the perpetrator-survivor scale.
p272
aVIf nothing else,
p273
aVit's a story that we would've needed to hear when we were younger.
p274
aa(lp275
VGiven the nature of our story,
p276
aVI know the words that inevitably accompany it \u2014
p277
aVvictim, rapist \u2014
p278
aVand labels are a way to organize concepts,
p279
aVbut they can also be dehumanizing in their connotations.
p280
aVOnce someone's been deemed a victim,
p281
aVit's that much easier to file them away as someone damaged,
p282
aVdishonored,
p283
aVless than.
p284
aVAnd likewise, once someone has been branded a rapist,
p285
aVit's that much easier to call him a monster \u2014
p286
aVinhuman.
p287
aVBut how will we understand what it is in human societies
p288
aVthat produces violence
p289
aVif we refuse to recognize the humanity of those who commit it?
p290
aVAnd how \u2014
p291
aa(lp292
V(Applause)
p293
aa(lp294
VAnd how can we empower survivors if we're making them feel less than?
p295
aVHow can we discuss solutions to one of the biggest threats
p296
aVto the lives of women and children around the world,
p297
aVif the very words we use are part of the problem?
p298
aa(lp299
VTS: From what I've now learnt,
p300
aVmy actions that night in 1996 were a self-centered taking.
p301
aVI felt deserving of Thordis's body.
p302
aVI've had primarily positive social influences
p303
aVand examples of equitable behavior around me.
p304
aVBut on that occasion,
p305
aVI chose to draw upon the negative ones.
p306
aVThe ones that see women as having less intrinsic worth,
p307
aVand of men having some unspoken and symbolic claim to their bodies.
p308
aVThese influences I speak of are external to me, though.
p309
aVAnd it was only me in that room making choices,
p310
aVnobody else.
p311
aa(lp312
VWhen you own something
p313
aVand really square up to your culpability,
p314
aVI do think a surprising thing can happen.
p315
aVIt's what I call a paradox of ownership.
p316
aVI thought I'd buckle under the weight of responsibility.
p317
aVI thought my certificate of humanity would be burnt.
p318
aVInstead, I was offered to really own what I did,
p319
aVand found that it didn't possess the entirety of who I am.
p320
aVPut simply,
p321
aVsomething you've done doesn't have to constitute the sum of who you are.
p322
aVThe noise in my head abated.
p323
aVThe indulgent self-pity was starved of oxygen,
p324
aVand it was replaced with the clean air of acceptance \u2014
p325
aVan acceptance that I did hurt this wonderful person standing next to me;
p326
aVan acceptance that I am part of a large and shockingly everyday grouping of men
p327
aVwho have been sexually violent toward their partners.
p328
aa(lp329
VDon't underestimate the power of words.
p330
aVSaying to Thordis that I raped her changed my accord with myself,
p331
aVas well as with her.
p332
aVBut most importantly,
p333
aVthe blame transferred from Thordis to me.
p334
aVFar too often,
p335
aVthe responsibility is attributed to female survivors of sexual violence,
p336
aVand not to the males who enact it.
p337
aVFar too often,
p338
aVthe denial and running leaves all parties at a great distance from the truth.
p339
aVThere's definitely a public conversation happening now,
p340
aVand like a lot of people,
p341
aVwe're heartened that there's less retreating
p342
aVfrom this difficult but important discussion.
p343
aVI feel a real responsibility to add our voices to it.
p344
aa(lp345
VTE: What we did is not a formula that we're prescribing for others.
p346
aVNobody has the right to tell anyone else how to handle their deepest pain
p347
aVor their greatest error.
p348
aVBreaking your silence is never easy,
p349
aVand depending on where you are in the world,
p350
aVit can even be deadly to speak out about rape.
p351
aVI realize that even the most traumatic event of my life
p352
aVis still a testament to my privilege,
p353
aVbecause I can talk about it without getting ostracized,
p354
aVor even killed.
p355
aVBut with that privilege of having a voice
p356
aVcomes the responsibility of using it.
p357
aVThat's the least I owe my fellow survivors who can't.
p358
aa(lp359
VThe story we've just relayed is unique,
p360
aVand yet it is so common with sexual violence being a global pandemic.
p361
aVBut it doesn't have to be that way.
p362
aVOne of the things that I found useful on my own healing journey
p363
aVis educating myself about sexual violence.
p364
aVAnd as a result, I've been reading, writing
p365
aVand speaking about this issue for over a decade now,
p366
aVgoing to conferences around the world.
p367
aVAnd in my experience,
p368
aVthe attendees of such events are almost exclusively women.
p369
aVBut it's about time that we stop treating sexual violence as a women's issue.
p370
aa(lp371
V(Applause)
p372
aa(lp373
VA majority of sexual violence against women and men
p374
aVis perpetrated by men.
p375
aVAnd yet their voices are sorely underrepresented in this discussion.
p376
aVBut all of us are needed here.
p377
aVJust imagine all the suffering we could alleviate
p378
aVif we dared to face this issue together.
p379
