VChris Anderson: So I guess what we're going to do is
p4
aVwe're going to talk about your life,
p5
aVand using some pictures that you shared with me.
p6
aVAnd I think we should start right here with this one.
p7
aVOkay, now who is this?
p8
aa(lp9
VMartine Rothblatt: This is me with our oldest son Eli.
p10
aVHe was about age five.
p11
aVThis is taken in Nigeria
p12
aVright after having taken the Washington, D.C. bar exam.
p13
aa(lp14
VCA: Okay. But this doesn't really look like a Martine.
p15
aa(lp16
VMR: Right. That was myself as a male, the way I was brought up.
p17
aVBefore I transitioned from male to female and Martin to Martine.
p18
aa(lp19
VCA: You were brought up Martin Rothblatt.
p20
aa(lp21
VMR: Correct.
p22
aa(lp23
VCA: And about a year after this picture, you married a beautiful woman.
p24
aVWas this love at first sight? What happened there?
p25
aa(lp26
VMR: It was love at the first sight.
p27
aVI saw Bina at a discotheque in Los Angeles,
p28
aVand we later began living together,
p29
aVbut the moment I saw her, I saw just an aura of energy around her.
p30
aVI asked her to dance.
p31
aVShe said she saw an aura of energy around me.
p32
aVI was a single male parent. She was a single female parent.
p33
aVWe showed each other our kids' pictures,
p34
aVand we've been happily married for a third of a century now.
p35
aV(Applause)
p36
aa(lp37
VCA: And at the time, you were kind of this hotshot entrepreneur,
p38
aVworking with satellites.
p39
aVI think you had two successful companies,
p40
aVand then you started addressing this problem
p41
aVof how could you use satellites to revolutionize radio.
p42
aVTell us about that.
p43
aa(lp44
VMR: Right. I always loved space technology,
p45
aVand satellites, to me, are sort of like the canoes that our ancestors
p46
aVfirst pushed out into the water.
p47
aVSo it was exciting for me to be part of the navigation
p48
aVof the oceans of the sky,
p49
aVand as I developed different types of satellite communication systems,
p50
aVthe main thing I did was to launch bigger and more powerful satellites,
p51
aVthe consequence of which was that the receiving antennas
p52
aVcould be smaller and smaller,
p53
aVand after going through direct television broadcasting,
p54
aVI had the idea that if we could make a more powerful satellite,
p55
aVthe receiving dish could be so small
p56
aVthat it would just be a section of a parabolic dish,
p57
aVa flat little plate embedded into the roof of an automobile,
p58
aVand it would be possible to have nationwide satellite radio,
p59
aVand that's Sirius XM today.
p60
aa(lp61
VCA: Wow. So who here has used Sirius?
p62
aa(lp63
V(Applause)
p64
aa(lp65
VMR: Thank you for your monthly subscriptions.
p66
aa(lp67
V(Laughter)
p68
aa(lp69
VCA: So that succeeded despite all predictions at the time.
p70
aVIt was a huge commercial success,
p71
aVbut soon after this, in the early 1990s,
p72
aVthere was this big transition in your life and you became Martine.
p73
aa(lp74
VMR: Correct. CA: So tell me, how did that happen?
p75
aVMR: It happened in consultation with Bina and our four beautiful children,
p76
aVand I discussed with each of them
p77
aVthat I felt my soul was always female, and as a woman,
p78
aVbut I was afraid people would laugh at me if I expressed it,
p79
aVso I always kept it bottled up
p80
aVand just showed my male side.
p81
aVAnd each of them had a different take on this.
p82
aVBina said, "I love your soul,
p83
aVand whether the outside is Martin and Martine,
p84
aVit doesn't it matter to me, I love your soul."
p85
aVMy son said, "If you become a woman, will you still be my father?"
p86
aVAnd I said, "Yes, I'll always be your father,"
p87
aVand I'm still his father today.
p88
aVMy youngest daughter did an absolutely brilliant five-year-old thing.
p89
aVShe told people, "I love my dad and she loves me."
p90
aVSo she had no problem with a gender blending whatsoever.
p91
aa(lp92
VCA: And a couple years after this, you published this book:
p93
aV"The Apartheid of Sex."
p94
aVWhat was your thesis in this book?
p95
aa(lp96
VMR: My thesis in this book is that there are seven billion people in the world,
p97
aVand actually, seven billion unique ways to express one's gender.
p98
aVAnd while people may have the genitals of a male or a female,
p99
aVthe genitals don't determine your gender
p100
aVor even really your sexual identity.
p101
aVThat's just a matter of anatomy
p102
aVand reproductive tracts,
p103
aVand people could choose whatever gender they want
p104
aVif they weren't forced by society into categories of either male or female
p105
aVthe way South Africa used to force people into categories of black or white.
p106
aVWe know from anthropological science that race is fiction,
p107
aVeven though racism is very, very real,
p108
aVand we now know from cultural studies
p109
aVthat separate male or female genders is a constructed fiction.
p110
aVThe reality is a gender fluidity
p111
aVthat crosses the entire continuum from male to female.
p112
aa(lp113
VCA: You yourself don't always feel 100 percent female.
p114
aa(lp115
VMR: Correct. I would say in some ways
p116
aVI change my gender about as often as I change my hairstyle.
p117
aa(lp118
VCA: (Laughs) Okay, now, this is your gorgeous daughter, Jenesis.
p119
aVAnd I guess she was about this age when something pretty terrible happened.
p120
aa(lp121
VMR: Yes, she was finding herself unable to walk up the stairs
p122
aVin our house to her bedroom,
p123
aVand after several months of doctors,
p124
aVshe was diagnosed to have a rare, almost invariably fatal disease
p125
aVcalled pulmonary arterial hypertension.
p126
aa(lp127
VCA: So how did you respond to that?
p128
aa(lp129
VMR: Well, we first tried to get her to the best doctors we could.
p130
aVWe ended up at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C.
p131
aVThe head of pediatric cardiology
p132
aVtold us that he was going to refer her to get a lung transplant,
p133
aVbut not to hold out any hope,
p134
aVbecause there are very few lungs available,
p135
aVespecially for children.
p136
aVHe said that all people with this illness died,
p137
aVand if any of you have seen the film "Lorenzo's Oil,"
p138
aVthere's a scene when the protagonist
p139
aVkind of rolls down the stairway crying and bemoaning the fate of his son,
p140
aVand that's exactly how we felt about Jenesis.
p141
aa(lp142
VCA: But you didn't accept that as the limit of what you could do.
p143
aVYou started trying to research and see if you could find a cure somehow.
p144
aa(lp145
VMR: Correct. She was in the intensive care ward for weeks at a time,
p146
aVand Bina and I would tag team to stay at the hospital
p147
aVwhile the other watched the rest of the kids,
p148
aVand when I was in the hospital and she was sleeping,
p149
aVI went to the hospital library.
p150
aVI read every article that I could find on pulmonary hypertension.
p151
aVI had not taken any biology, even in college,
p152
aVso I had to go from a biology textbook to a college-level textbook
p153
aVand then medical textbook and the journal articles, back and forth,
p154
aVand eventually I knew enough to think that it might be possible
p155
aVthat somebody could find a cure.
p156
aVSo we started a nonprofit foundation.
p157
aVI wrote a description asking people to submit grants
p158
aVand we would pay for medical research.
p159
aVI became an expert on the condition \u2014 doctors said to me, Martine,
p160
aVwe really appreciate all the funding you've provided us,
p161
aVbut we are not going to be able to find a cure in time
p162
aVto save your daughter.
p163
aVHowever, there is a medicine
p164
aVthat was developed at the Burroughs Wellcome Company
p165
aVthat could halt the progression of the disease,
p166
aVbut Burroughs Wellcome has just been acquired by Glaxo Wellcome.
p167
aVThey made a decision not to develop
p168
aVany medicines for rare and orphan diseases,
p169
aVand maybe you could use your expertise in satellite communications
p170
aVto develop this cure for pulmonary hypertension.
p171
aa(lp172
VCA: So how on earth did you get access to this drug?
p173
aa(lp174
VMR: I went to Glaxo Wellcome
p175
aVand after three times being rejected and having the door slammed in my face
p176
aVbecause they weren't going to out-license the drug
p177
aVto a satellite communications expert,
p178
aVthey weren't going to send the drug out to anybody at all,
p179
aVand they thought I didn't have the expertise,
p180
aVfinally I was able to persuade a small team of people to work with me
p181
aVand develop enough credibility.
p182
aVI wore down their resistance,
p183
aVand they had no hope this drug would even work, by the way,
p184
aVand they tried to tell me, "You're just wasting your time.
p185
aVWe're sorry about your daughter."
p186
aVBut finally, for 25,000 dollars
p187
aVand agreement to pay 10 percent of any revenues we might ever get,
p188
aVthey agreed to give me worldwide rights to this drug.
p189
aa(lp190
VCA: And so you put this drug on the market in a really brilliant way,
p191
aVby basically charging what it would take to make the economics work.
p192
aa(lp193
VMR: Oh yes, Chris, but this really wasn't a drug that I ended up \u2014
p194
aVafter I wrote the check for 25,000,
p195
aVand I said, "Okay, where's the medicine for Jenesis?"
p196
aVthey said, "Oh, Martine, there's no medicine for Jenesis.
p197
aVThis is just something we tried in rats."
p198
aVAnd they gave me, like, a little plastic Ziploc bag
p199
aVof a small amount of powder.
p200
aVThey said, "Don't give it to any human,"
p201
aVand they gave me a piece of paper which said it was a patent,
p202
aVand from that, we had to figure out a way to make this medicine.
p203
aVA hundred chemists in the U.S. at the top universities
p204
aVall swore that little patent could never be turned into a medicine.
p205
aVIf it was turned into a medicine, it could never be delivered
p206
aVbecause it had a half-life of only 45 minutes.
p207
aa(lp208
VCA: And yet, a year or two later, you were there with a medicine
p209
aVthat worked for Jenesis.
p210
aa(lp211
VMR: Chris, the astonishing thing is that this absolutely worthless
p212
aVpiece of powder
p213
aVthat had the sparkle of a promise of hope for Jenesis
p214
aVis not only keeping Jenesis and other people alive today,
p215
aVbut produces almost a billion and a half dollars a year in revenue.
p216
aa(lp217
V(Applause)
p218
aa(lp219
VCA: So here you go.
p220
aVSo you took this company public, right?
p221
aVAnd made an absolute fortune.
p222
aVAnd how much have you paid Glaxo, by the way, after that 25,000?
p223
aa(lp224
VMR: Yeah, well, every year we pay them 10 percent of 1.5 billion,
p225
aV150 million dollars, last year 100 million dollars.
p226
aVIt's the best return on investment they ever received. (Laughter)
p227
aa(lp228
VCA: And the best news of all, I guess,
p229
aVis this.
p230
aa(lp231
VMR: Yes. Jenesis is an absolutely brilliant young lady.
p232
aVShe's alive, healthy today at 30.
p233
aVYou see me, Bina and Jenesis there.
p234
aVThe most amazing thing about Jenesis
p235
aVis that while she could do anything with her life,
p236
aVand believe me, if you grew up your whole life with people
p237
aVin your face saying that you've got a fatal disease,
p238
aVI would probably run to Tahiti and just not want to run into anybody again.
p239
aVBut instead she chooses to work in United Therapeutics.
p240
aVShe says she wants to do all she can to help other people
p241
aVwith orphan diseases get medicines,
p242
aVand today, she's our project leader for all telepresence activities,
p243
aVwhere she helps digitally unite the entire company to work together
p244
aVto find cures for pulmonary hypertension.
p245
aa(lp246
VCA: But not everyone who has this disease has been so fortunate.
p247
aVThere are still many people dying, and you are tackling that too. How?
p248
aa(lp249
VMR: Exactly, Chris. There's some 3,000 people a year in the United States alone,
p250
aVperhaps 10 times that number worldwide,
p251
aVwho continue to die of this illness
p252
aVbecause the medicines slow down the progression
p253
aVbut they don't halt it.
p254
aVThe only cure for pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis,
p255
aVcystic fibrosis, emphysema,
p256
aVCOPD, what Leonard Nimoy just died of,
p257
aVis a lung transplant,
p258
aVbut sadly, there are only enough available lungs for 2,000 people
p259
aVin the U.S. a year to get a lung transplant,
p260
aVwhereas nearly a half million people a year
p261
aVdie of end-stage lung failure.
p262
aVCA: So how can you address that?
p263
aVMR: So I conceptualize the possibility
p264
aVthat just like we keep cars and planes
p265
aVand buildings going forever
p266
aVwith an unlimited supply of building parts and machine parts,
p267
aVwhy can't we create an unlimited supply of transplantable organs
p268
aVto keep people living indefinitely,
p269
aVand especially people with lung disease.
p270
aVSo we've teamed up with the decoder of the human genome, Craig Venter,
p271
aVand the company he founded
p272
aVwith Peter Diamandis, the founder of the X Prize,
p273
aVto genetically modify
p274
aVthe pig genome
p275
aVso that the pig's organs will not be rejected by the human body
p276
aVand thereby to create an unlimited supply
p277
aVof transplantable organs.
p278
aVWe do this through our company, United Therapeutics.
p279
aa(lp280
VCA: So you really believe that within, what, a decade,
p281
aVthat this shortage of transplantable lungs maybe be cured, through these guys?
p282
aa(lp283
VMR: Absolutely, Chris.
p284
aVI'm as certain of that as I was of the success that we've had
p285
aVwith direct television broadcasting, Sirius XM.
p286
aVIt's actually not rocket science.
p287
aVIt's straightforward engineering away one gene after another.
p288
aVWe're so lucky to be born in the time that sequencing genomes
p289
aVis a routine activity,
p290
aVand the brilliant folks at Synthetic Genomics
p291
aVare able to zero in on the pig genome,
p292
aVfind exactly the genes that are problematic, and fix them.
p293
aa(lp294
VCA: But it's not just bodies that \u2014 though that is amazing.
p295
aV(Applause)
p296
aVIt's not just long-lasting bodies that are of interest to you now.
p297
aVIt's long-lasting minds.
p298
aVAnd I think this graph for you says something quite profound.
p299
aVWhat does this mean?
p300
aa(lp301
VMR: What this graph means, and it comes from Ray Kurzweil,
p302
aVis that the rate of development in computer processing
p303
aVhardware, firmware and software,
p304
aVhas been advancing along a curve
p305
aVsuch that by the 2020s, as we saw in earlier presentations today,
p306
aVthere will be information technology
p307
aVthat processes information and the world around us
p308
aVat the same rate as a human mind.
p309
aa(lp310
VCA: And so that being so, you're actually getting ready for this world
p311
aVby believing that we will soon be able to, what,
p312
aVactually take the contents of our brains and somehow preserve them forever?
p313
aVHow do you describe that?
p314
aa(lp315
VMR: Well, Chris, what we're working on is creating a situation
p316
aVwhere people can create a mind file,
p317
aVand a mind file is the collection of their mannerisms, personality,
p318
aVrecollection, feelings,
p319
aVbeliefs, attitudes and values,
p320
aVeverything that we've poured today into Google, into Amazon, into Facebook,
p321
aVand all of this information stored there will be able, in the next couple decades,
p322
aVonce software is able to recapitulate consciousness,
p323
aVbe able to revive the consciousness which is imminent in our mind file.
p324
aa(lp325
VCA: Now you're not just messing around with this.
p326
aVYou're serious. I mean, who is this?
p327
aa(lp328
VMR: This is a robot version of my beloved spouse, Bina.
p329
aVAnd we call her Bina 48.
p330
aVShe was programmed by Hanson Robotics out of Texas.
p331
aVThere's the centerfold from National Geographic magazine
p332
aVwith one of her caregivers,
p333
aVand she roams the web
p334
aVand has hundreds of hours of Bina's mannerisms, personalities.
p335
aVShe's kind of like a two-year-old kid,
p336
aVbut she says things that blow people away,
p337
aVbest expressed by perhaps
p338
aVa New York Times Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Amy Harmon
p339
aVwho says her answers are often frustrating,
p340
aVbut other times as compelling as those of any flesh person she's interviewed.
p341
aa(lp342
VCA: And is your thinking here, part of your hope here, is that
p343
aVthis version of Bina can in a sense live on forever, or some future upgrade
p344
aVto this version can live on forever?
p345
aVMR: Yes. Not just Bina, but everybody.
p346
aVYou know, it costs us virtually nothing to store our mind files
p347
aVon Facebook, Instagram, what-have-you.
p348
aVSocial media is I think one of the most extraordinary inventions of our time,
p349
aVand as apps become available that will allow us
p350
aVto out-Siri Siri, better and better,
p351
aVand develop consciousness operating systems,
p352
aVeverybody in the world, billions of people,
p353
aVwill be able to develop mind clones of themselves
p354
aVthat will have their own life on the web.
p355
aa(lp356
VCA: So the thing is, Martine,
p357
aVthat in any normal conversation, this would sound stark-staring mad,
p358
aVbut in the context of your life, what you've done,
p359
aVsome of the things we've heard this week,
p360
aVthe constructed realities that our minds give,
p361
aVI mean, you wouldn't bet against it.
p362
aa(lp363
VMR: Well, I think it's really nothing coming from me.
p364
aVIf anything, I'm perhaps a bit of a communicator of activities
p365
aVthat are being undertaken by the greatest companies
p366
aVin China, Japan, India, the U.S., Europe.
p367
aVThere are tens of millions of people working on writing code
p368
aVthat expresses more and more aspects of our human consciousness,
p369
aVand you don't have to be a genius to see that all these threads
p370
aVare going to come together and ultimately create human consciousness,
p371
aVand it's something we'll value.
p372
aVThere are so many things to do in this life,
p373
aVand if we could have a simulacrum, a digital doppelgänger of ourselves
p374
aVthat helps us process books, do shopping,
p375
aVbe our best friends,
p376
aVI believe our mind clones, these digital versions of ourselves,
p377
aVwill ultimately be our best friends,
p378
aVand for me personally and Bina personally,
p379
aVwe love each other like crazy.
p380
aVEach day, we are always saying, like,
p381
aV"Wow, I love you even more than 30 years ago.
p382
aVAnd so for us, the prospect of mind clones
p383
aVand regenerated bodies
p384
aVis that our love affair, Chris, can go on forever.
p385
aVAnd we never get bored of each other. I'm sure we never will.
p386
aa(lp387
VCA: I think Bina's here, right? MR: She is, yeah.
p388
aVCA: Would it be too much, I don't know, do we have a handheld mic?
p389
aVBina, could we invite you to the stage? I just have to ask you one question.
p390
aVBesides, we need to see you.
p391
aa(lp392
V(Applause)
p393
aa(lp394
VThank you, thank you.
p395
aVCome and join Martine here.
p396
aVI mean, look, when you got married,
p397
aVif someone had told you that, in a few years time,
p398
aVthe man you were marrying would become a woman,
p399
aVand a few years after that, you would become a robot \u2014
p400
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p401
aVhow has this gone? How has it been?
p402
aa(lp403
VBina Rothblatt: It's been really an exciting journey,
p404
aVand I would have never thought that at the time,
p405
aVbut we started making goals and setting those goals
p406
aVand accomplishing things,
p407
aVand before you knew it, we just keep going up and up
p408
aVand we're still not stopping, so it's great.
p409
aa(lp410
VCA: Martine told me something really beautiful,
p411
aVjust actually on Skype before this,
p412
aVwhich was that he wanted to live for hundreds of years
p413
aVas a mind file,
p414
aVbut not if it wasn't with you.
p415
aa(lp416
VBR: That's right, we want to do it together.
p417
aVWe're cryonicists as well, and we want to wake up together.
p418
aa(lp419
VCA: So just so as you know, from my point of view,
p420
aVthis isn't only one of the most astonishing lives I have heard,
p421
aVit's one of the most astonishing love stories I've ever heard.
p422
aVIt's just a delight to have you both here at TED.
p423
aVThank you so much.
