VThose of you who may remember me from TEDGlobal
p4
aVremember me asking a few questions
p5
aVwhich still preoccupy me.
p6
aVOne of them was: Why is it necessary to spend
p7
aVsix billion pounds
p8
aVspeeding up the Eurostar train
p9
aVwhen, for about 10 percent of that money,
p10
aVyou could have top supermodels, male and female,
p11
aVserving free Chateau Petrus to all the passengers
p12
aVfor the entire duration of the journey?
p13
aVYou'd still have five billion left in change,
p14
aVand people would ask for the trains to be slowed down.
p15
aVNow, you may remember me asking the question as well,
p16
aVa very interesting observation,
p17
aVthat actually those strange little signs
p18
aVthat actually flash "35" at you,
p19
aVoccasionally accompanying a little smiley face
p20
aVor a frown,
p21
aVaccording to whether you're within or outside the speed limit \u2014
p22
aVthose are actually more effective
p23
aVat preventing road accidents than speed cameras,
p24
aVwhich come with the actual threat
p25
aVof real punishment.
p26
aa(lp27
VSo there seems to be a strange disproportionality at work,
p28
aVI think, in many areas of human problem solving,
p29
aVparticularly those which involve human psychology,
p30
aVwhich is: The tendency
p31
aVof the organization or the institution
p32
aVis to deploy as much force as possible,
p33
aVas much compulsion as possible,
p34
aVwhereas actually, the tendency of the person
p35
aVis to be almost influenced
p36
aVin absolute reverse proportion
p37
aVto the amount of force being applied.
p38
aVSo there seems to be a complete disconnect here.
p39
aVSo what I'm asking for is the creation of a new job title \u2014
p40
aVI'll come to this a little later \u2014
p41
aVand perhaps the addition of a new word
p42
aVinto the English language.
p43
aVBecause it does seem to me that large organizations
p44
aVincluding government, which is, of course, the largest organization of all,
p45
aVhave actually become
p46
aVcompletely disconnected
p47
aVwith what actually matters to people.
p48
aa(lp49
VLet me give you one example of this.
p50
aVYou may remember this as the AOL-Time Warner merger, okay,
p51
aVheralded at the time as the largest
p52
aVsingle deal of all time.
p53
aVIt may still be, for all I know.
p54
aVNow, all of you in this room, in one form or other,
p55
aVare probably customers of one or both
p56
aVof those organizations that merged.
p57
aVJust interested, did anybody notice anything different
p58
aVas a result of this at all?
p59
aVSo unless you happened to be a shareholder
p60
aVof one or the other organizations
p61
aVor one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no-doubt lucrative activity,
p62
aVyou're actually engaging in a huge piece of activity
p63
aVthat meant absolutely bugger-all to anybody, okay?
p64
aVBy contrast, years of marketing have taught me
p65
aVthat if you actually want people to remember you
p66
aVand to appreciate what you do,
p67
aVthe most potent things are actually very, very small.
p68
aVThis is from Virgin Atlantic upper-class,
p69
aVit's the cruet salt and pepper set.
p70
aVQuite nice in itself, they're little, sort of, airplane things.
p71
aVWhat's really, really sweet is every single person looking at these things
p72
aVhas exactly the same mischievous thought,
p73
aVwhich is, "I reckon I can heist these."
p74
aVHowever, you pick them up and underneath,
p75
aVactually engraved in the metal, are the words,
p76
aV"Stolen from Virgin Atlantic Airways upper-class."
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aVNow, years after
p79
aVyou remember the strategic question
p80
aVof whether you're flying in a 777 or an Airbus,
p81
aVyou remember those words and that experience.
p82
aa(lp83
VSimilarly, this is from a hotel in Stockholm, the Lydmar.
p84
aVHas anybody stayed there?
p85
aVIt's the lift, it's a series of buttons in the lift.
p86
aVNothing unusual about that at all,
p87
aVexcept that these are actually not the buttons that take you to an individual floor.
p88
aVIt starts with garage at the bottom, I suppose, appropriately,
p89
aVbut it doesn't go up garage, grand floor, mezzanine, one, two, three, four.
p90
aVIt actually says garage, funk, rhythm and blues.
p91
aVYou have a series of buttons. You actually choose your lift music.
p92
aVMy guess is that the cost of installing this in the lift
p93
aVin the Lydmar Hotel in Stockholm
p94
aVis probably 500 to 1,000 pounds max.
p95
aVIt's frankly more memorable
p96
aVthan all those millions of hotels we've all stayed at
p97
aVthat tell you that your room has actually been recently renovated
p98
aVat a cost of 500,000 dollars,
p99
aVin order to make it resemble every other hotel room you've ever stayed in
p100
aVin the entire course of your life.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, these are trivial marketing examples, I accept.
p103
aVBut I was at a TED event recently and Esther Duflo,
p104
aVprobably one of the leading experts in,
p105
aVeffectively, the eradication of poverty in the developing world,
p106
aVactually spoke.
p107
aVAnd she came across a similar example
p108
aVof something that fascinated me
p109
aVas being something which, in a business context or a government context,
p110
aVwould simply be so trivial a solution
p111
aVas to seem embarrassing.
p112
aVIt was simply to encourage the inoculation of children
p113
aVby, not only making it a social event \u2014
p114
aVI think good use of behavioral economics in that,
p115
aVif you turn up with several other mothers
p116
aVto have your child inoculated,
p117
aVyour sense of confidence is much greater than if you turn up alone.
p118
aVBut secondly, to incentivize that inoculation
p119
aVby giving a kilo of lentils to everybody who participated.
p120
aVIt's a tiny, tiny thing.
p121
aVIf you're a senior person at UNESCO
p122
aVand someone says, "So what are you doing
p123
aVto eradicate world poverty?"
p124
aVyou're not really confident standing up there
p125
aVsaying, "I've got it cracked; it's the lentils," are you?
p126
aa(lp127
VOur own sense of self-aggrandizement
p128
aVfeels that big important problems
p129
aVneed to have big important, and most of all, expensive
p130
aVsolutions attached to them.
p131
aVAnd yet, what behavioral economics shows time after time after time
p132
aVis in human behavioral and behavioral change
p133
aVthere's a very, very strong disproportionality at work,
p134
aVthat actually what changes our behavior
p135
aVand what changes our attitude to things
p136
aVis not actually proportionate to the degree
p137
aVof expense entailed,
p138
aVor the degree of force that's applied.
p139
aVBut everything about institutions
p140
aVmakes them uncomfortable
p141
aVwith that disproportionality.
p142
aVSo what happens in an institution
p143
aVis the very person who has the power to solve the problem
p144
aValso has a very, very large budget.
p145
aVAnd once you have a very, very large budget,
p146
aVyou actually look for expensive things to spend it on.
p147
aVWhat is completely lacking is a class of people
p148
aVwho have immense amounts of power, but no money at all.
p149
aV(Laughter)
p150
aVIt's those people I'd quite like to create
p151
aVin the world going forward.
p152
aa(lp153
VNow, here's another thing that happens,
p154
aVwhich is what I call sometimes "Terminal 5 syndrome,"
p155
aVwhich is that big, expensive things
p156
aVget big, highly-intelligent attention,
p157
aVand they're great, and Terminal 5 is absolutely magnificent,
p158
aVuntil you get down to the small detail, the usability,
p159
aVwhich is the signage,
p160
aVwhich is catastrophic.
p161
aVYou come out of "Arrive" at the airport, and you follow
p162
aVa big yellow sign that says "Trains" and it's in front of you.
p163
aVSo you walk for another hundred yards,
p164
aVexpecting perhaps another sign,
p165
aVthat might courteously be yellow, in front of you and saying "Trains."
p166
aVNo, no, no, the next one is actually blue, to your left,
p167
aVand says "Heathrow Express."
p168
aVI mean, it could almost be rather like that scene from the film "Airplane."
p169
aVA yellow sign? That's exactly what they'll be expecting.
p170
aa(lp171
VActually, what happens in the world increasingly \u2014
p172
aVnow, all credit to the British Airport Authority.
p173
aVI spoke about this before,
p174
aVand a brilliant person got in touch with me and said, "Okay, what can you do?"
p175
aVSo I did come up with five suggestions, which they are actually actioning.
p176
aVOne of them also being,
p177
aValthough logically it's quite a good idea
p178
aVto have a lift with no up and down button in it,
p179
aVif it only serves two floors,
p180
aVit's actually bloody terrifying, okay?
p181
aVBecause when the door closes
p182
aVand there's nothing for you to do,
p183
aVyou've actually just stepped into a Hammer film.
p184
aa(lp185
V(Laughter)
p186
aa(lp187
VSo these questions ... what is happening in the world
p188
aVis the big stuff, actually,
p189
aVis done magnificently well.
p190
aVBut the small stuff, what you might call the user interface,
p191
aVis done spectacularly badly.
p192
aVBut also, there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock
p193
aVin terms of solving these small solutions.
p194
aVBecause the people who can actually solve them
p195
aVactually are too powerful and too preoccupied
p196
aVwith something they think of as "strategy" to actually solve them.
p197
aVI tried this exercise recently, talking about banking.
p198
aVThey said, "Can we do an advertising campaign?
p199
aVWhat can we do and encourage more online banking?"
p200
aVI said, "It's really, really easy."
p201
aVI said, "When people login to their online bank
p202
aVthere are lots and lots of things they'd probably quite like to look at.
p203
aVThe last thing in the world you ever want to see is your balance."
p204
aVI've got friends who actually
p205
aVnever use their own bank cash machines
p206
aVbecause there's the risk that it might display
p207
aVtheir balance on the screen.
p208
aa(lp209
VWhy would you willingly expose yourself to bad news?
p210
aVOkay, you simply wouldn't.
p211
aVI said, "If you make, actually, 'Tell me my balance.'
p212
aVIf you make that an option rather than the default,
p213
aVyou'll find twice as many people log on to online banking,
p214
aVand they do it three times as often."
p215
aVLet's face it, most of us \u2014 how many of you
p216
aVactually check your balance before you remove cash from a cash machine?
p217
aVAnd you're pretty rich by the standards of the world at large.
p218
aVNow, interesting that no single person does that,
p219
aVor at least can admit to being so anal as to do it.
p220
aVBut what's interesting about that suggestion
p221
aVwas that, to implement that suggestion wouldn't cost 10 million pounds;
p222
aVit wouldn't involve large amounts of expenditure;
p223
aVit would actually cost about 50 quid.
p224
aVAnd yet, it never happens.
p225
aa(lp226
VBecause there's a fundamental disconnect, as I said,
p227
aVthat actually, the people with the power
p228
aVwant to do big expensive things.
p229
aVAnd there's to some extent a big strategy myth
p230
aVthat's prevalent in business now.
p231
aVAnd if you think about it, it's very, very important
p232
aVthat the strategy myth is maintained.
p233
aVBecause, if the board of directors convince everybody
p234
aVthat the success of any organization
p235
aVis almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors,
p236
aVit makes the disparity in salaries
p237
aVslightly more justifiable
p238
aVthan if you actually acknowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company's success
p239
aVmight actually lie somewhere else,
p240
aVin small pieces of tactical activity.
p241
aa(lp242
VBut what is happening is that effectively \u2014
p243
aVand the invention of the spreadsheet hasn't helped this;
p244
aVlots of things haven't helped this \u2014
p245
aVbusiness and government suffers from a kind of physics envy.
p246
aVIt wants the world to be the kind of place where
p247
aVthe input and the change are proportionate.
p248
aVIt's a kind of mechanistic world
p249
aVthat we'd all love to live in
p250
aVwhere, effectively, it sits very nicely on spreadsheets,
p251
aVeverything is numerically expressible,
p252
aVand the amount you spend on something is proportionate
p253
aVto the scale of your success.
p254
aVThat's the world people actually want.
p255
aVIn truth, we do live in a world that science can understand.
p256
aVUnfortunately, the science is probably closer to being climatology
p257
aVin that in many cases,
p258
aVvery, very small changes
p259
aVcan have disproportionately huge effects,
p260
aVand equally, vast areas of activity, enormous mergers,
p261
aVcan actually accomplish absolutely bugger-all.
p262
aVBut it's very, very uncomfortable for us
p263
aVto actually acknowledge that we're living in such a world.
p264
aa(lp265
VBut what I'm saying is we could just make things
p266
aVa little bit better for ourselves
p267
aVif we looked at it in this very simple four-way approach.
p268
aVThat is actually strategy, and I'm not denying that strategy has a role.
p269
aVYou know, there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money
p270
aVand you accomplish quite a lot.
p271
aVAnd I'd be wrong to dis that completely.
p272
aVMoving over, we come, of course, to consultancy.
p273
aa(lp274
V(Laughter)
p275
aa(lp276
VI thought it was very indecent of Accenture
p277
aVto ditch Tiger Woods in such
p278
aVa sort of hurried and hasty way.
p279
aVI mean, Tiger surely was actually obeying the Accenture model.
p280
aVHe developed an interesting outsourcing model for sexual services,
p281
aV(Laughter)
p282
aVno longer tied to a single monopoly provider,
p283
aVin many cases, sourcing things locally,
p284
aVand of course, the ability to have between one and three girls delivered at any time
p285
aVled for better load-balancing.
p286
aVSo what Accenture suddenly found so unattractive about that, I'm not sure.
p287
aa(lp288
VThen there are other things that don't cost much and achieve absolutely nothing.
p289
aVThat's called trivia.
p290
aVBut there's a fourth thing.
p291
aVAnd the fundamental problem is we don't actually have a word for this stuff.
p292
aVWe don't know what to call it.
p293
aVAnd actually we don't spend nearly enough money
p294
aVlooking for those things,
p295
aVlooking for those tiny things that may or may not work,
p296
aVbut which, if they do work,
p297
aVcan have a success absolutely out of proportion
p298
aVto their expense, their efforts
p299
aVand the disruption they cause.
p300
aa(lp301
VSo the first thing I'd like
p302
aVis a competition \u2014 to anybody watching this as a film \u2014
p303
aVis to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right.
p304
aVAnd the second thing, I think,
p305
aVis that the world needs to have people in charge of that.
p306
aVThat's why I call for the "Chief Detail Officer."
p307
aVEvery corporation should have one,
p308
aVand every government should have a Ministry of Detail.
p309
aVThe people who actually have no money,
p310
aVwho have no extravagant budget,
p311
aVbut who realize that actually
p312
aVyou might achieve greater success in uptake
p313
aVof a government program
p314
aVby actually doubling the level of benefits you pay,
p315
aVbut you'll probably achieve exactly that same effect
p316
aVsimply by redesigning the form
p317
aVand writing it in comprehensible English.
p318
aVAnd if actually we created a Ministry of Detail
p319
aVand business actually had Chief Detail Officers,
p320
aVthen that fourth quadrant,
p321
aVwhich is so woefully neglected at the moment,
p322
aVmight finally get the attention it deserves.
p323
aa(lp324
VThank you very much.
