VI have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 times.
p4
aVI'm giving a short slide show this morning
p5
aVthat I'm giving for the very first time, so \u2014
p6
aVwell it's \u2014 I don't want or need to raise the bar,
p7
aVI'm actually trying to lower the bar.
p8
aVBecause I've cobbled this together
p9
aVto try to meet the challenge of this session.
p10
aa(lp11
VAnd I was reminded by Karen Armstrong's fantastic presentation
p12
aVthat religion really properly understood
p13
aVis not about belief, but about behavior.
p14
aVPerhaps we should say the same thing about optimism.
p15
aVHow dare we be optimistic?
p16
aVOptimism is sometimes characterized as a belief, an intellectual posture.
p17
aVAs Mahatma Gandhi famously said,
p18
aV"You must become the change you wish to see in the world."
p19
aVAnd the outcome about which
p20
aVwe wish to be optimistic is not going to be created
p21
aVby the belief alone, except to the extent that the belief
p22
aVbrings about new behavior. But the word "behavior"
p23
aVis also, I think, sometimes misunderstood in this context.
p24
aVI'm a big advocate of changing
p25
aVthe lightbulbs and buying hybrids,
p26
aVand Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house,
p27
aVand dug the geothermal wells, and did all of that other stuff.
p28
aVBut, as important as it is to change the lightbulbs,
p29
aVit is more important to change the laws.
p30
aVAnd when we change our behavior in our daily lives,
p31
aVwe sometimes leave out the citizenship part
p32
aVand the democracy part. In order to be optimistic about this,
p33
aVwe have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy.
p34
aVIn order to solve the climate crisis,
p35
aVwe have to solve the democracy crisis.
p36
aVAnd we have one.
p37
aa(lp38
VI have been trying to tell this story for a long time.
p39
aVI was reminded of that recently, by a woman
p40
aVwho walked past the table I was sitting at,
p41
aVjust staring at me as she walked past. She was in her 70s,
p42
aVlooked like she had a kind face. I thought nothing of it
p43
aVuntil I saw from the corner of my eye
p44
aVshe was walking from the opposite direction,
p45
aValso just staring at me. And so I said, "How do you do?"
p46
aVAnd she said, "You know, if you dyed your hair black,
p47
aVyou would look just like Al Gore." (Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VMany years ago, when I was a young congressman,
p50
aVI spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge
p51
aVof nuclear arms control \u2014 the nuclear arms race.
p52
aVAnd the military historians taught me,
p53
aVduring that quest, that military conflicts are typically
p54
aVput into three categories: local battles,
p55
aVregional or theater wars, and the rare but all-important
p56
aVglobal, world war \u2014 strategic conflicts.
p57
aVAnd each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources,
p58
aVa different approach,
p59
aVa different organizational model.
p60
aVEnvironmental challenges fall into the same three categories,
p61
aVand most of what we think about
p62
aVare local environmental problems: air pollution, water pollution,
p63
aVhazardous waste dumps. But there are also
p64
aVregional environmental problems, like acid rain
p65
aVfrom the Midwest to the Northeast, and from Western Europe
p66
aVto the Arctic, and from the Midwest
p67
aVout the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico.
p68
aVAnd there are lots of those. But the climate crisis
p69
aVis the rare but all-important
p70
aVglobal, or strategic, conflict.
p71
aVEverything is affected. And we have to organize our response
p72
aVappropriately. We need a worldwide, global mobilization
p73
aVfor renewable energy, conservation, efficiency
p74
aVand a global transition to a low-carbon economy.
p75
aVWe have work to do. And we can mobilize resources
p76
aVand political will. But the political will
p77
aVhas to be mobilized, in order to mobilize the resources.
p78
aa(lp79
VLet me show you these slides here.
p80
aVI thought I would start with the logo. What's missing here,
p81
aVof course, is the North Polar ice cap.
p82
aVGreenland remains. Twenty-eight years ago, this is what the
p83
aVpolar ice cap \u2014 the North Polar ice cap \u2014 looked like
p84
aVat the end of the summer, at the fall equinox.
p85
aVThis last fall, I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center
p86
aVin Boulder, Colorado, and talked to the researchers
p87
aVhere in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory.
p88
aVThis is what's happened in the last 28 years.
p89
aVTo put it in perspective, 2005 was the previous record.
p90
aVHere's what happened last fall
p91
aVthat has really unnerved the researchers.
p92
aVThe North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically \u2014
p93
aVdoesn't look quite the same size \u2014
p94
aVbut it is exactly the same size as the United States,
p95
aVminus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona.
p96
aVThe amount that disappeared in 2005
p97
aVwas equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi.
p98
aVThe extra amount that disappeared last fall
p99
aVwas equivalent to this much. It comes back in the winter,
p100
aVbut not as permanent ice, as thin ice \u2014
p101
aVvulnerable. The amount remaining could be completely gone
p102
aVin summer in as little as five years.
p103
aVThat puts a lot of pressure on Greenland.
p104
aVAlready, around the Arctic Circle \u2014
p105
aVthis is a famous village in Alaska. This is a town
p106
aVin Newfoundland. Antarctica. Latest studies from NASA.
p107
aVThe amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting
p108
aVof an area equivalent to the size of California.
p109
aa(lp110
V"They were the best of times,
p111
aVthey were the worst of times": the most famous opening sentence
p112
aVin English literature. I want to share briefly
p113
aVa tale of two planets. Earth and Venus
p114
aVare exactly the same size. Earth's diameter
p115
aVis about 400 kilometers larger, but essentially the same size.
p116
aVThey have exactly the same amount of carbon.
p117
aVBut the difference is, on Earth, most of the carbon
p118
aVhas been leeched over time out of the atmosphere,
p119
aVdeposited in the ground as coal, oil,
p120
aVnatural gas, etc. On Venus, most of it
p121
aVis in the atmosphere. The difference is that our temperature
p122
aVis 59 degrees on average. On Venus,
p123
aVit's 855. This is relevant to our current strategy
p124
aVof taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible,
p125
aVand putting it into the atmosphere.
p126
aVIt's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
p127
aVIt's three times hotter than Mercury,
p128
aVwhich is right next to the Sun. Now, briefly,
p129
aVhere's an image you've seen, as one of the only old images,
p130
aVbut I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI: Climate.
p131
aa(lp132
VThe global scientific community says:
p133
aVman-made global warming pollution, put into the atmosphere,
p134
aVthickening this, is trapping more of the outgoing infrared.
p135
aVYou all know that. At the last
p136
aVIPCC summary, the scientists wanted to say,
p137
aV"How certain are you?" They wanted to answer that "99 percent."
p138
aVThe Chinese objected, and so the compromise was
p139
aV"more than 90 percent."
p140
aVNow, the skeptics say, "Oh, wait a minute,
p141
aVthis could be variations in this energy
p142
aVcoming in from the sun." If that were true,
p143
aVthe stratosphere would be heated as well as the
p144
aVlower atmosphere, if it's more coming in.
p145
aVIf it's more being trapped on the way out, then you would
p146
aVexpect it to be warmer here and cooler here. Here is the lower atmosphere.
p147
aVHere's the stratosphere: cooler.
p148
aVCSI: Climate.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow, here's the good news. Sixty-eight percent of Americans now believe
p151
aVthat human activity is responsible
p152
aVfor global warming. Sixty-nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up
p153
aVin a significant way. There has been progress,
p154
aVbut here is the key: when given a list
p155
aVof challenges to confront, global warming is still listed at near the bottom.
p156
aVWhat is missing is a sense of urgency.
p157
aVIf you agree with the factual analysis,
p158
aVbut you don't feel the sense of urgency,
p159
aVwhere does that leave you?
p160
aVWell, the Alliance for Climate Protection, which I head
p161
aVin conjunction with Current TV \u2014 who did this pro bono \u2014
p162
aVdid a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this.
p163
aVThis is the winner.
p164
aa(lp165
VNBC \u2014 I'll show all of the networks here \u2014 the top journalists
p166
aVfor NBC asked 956 questions in 2007
p167
aVof the presidential candidates: two of them were about
p168
aVthe climate crisis. ABC: 844 questions, two about the climate crisis.
p169
aVFox: two. CNN: two. CBS: zero.
p170
aVFrom laughs to tears \u2014 this is one of the older
p171
aVtobacco commercials.
p172
aVSo here's what we're doing.
p173
aVThis is gasoline consumption in all of these countries. And us.
p174
aVBut it's not just the developed nations.
p175
aVThe developing countries are now following us
p176
aVand accelerating their pace. And actually,
p177
aVtheir cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent
p178
aVto where we were in 1965. And they're catching up
p179
aVvery dramatically. The total concentrations:
p180
aVby 2025, they will be essentially where we were in 1985.
p181
aVIf the wealthy countries were completely missing
p182
aVfrom the picture, we would still have this crisis.
p183
aVBut we have given to the developing countries
p184
aVthe technologies and the ways of thinking
p185
aVthat are creating the crisis. This is in Bolivia \u2014
p186
aVover thirty years.
p187
aa(lp188
VThis is peak fishing in a few seconds. The '60s.
p189
aV'70s. '80s. '90s. We have to stop this. And the good news is that we can.
p190
aVWe have the technologies.
p191
aVWe have to have a unified view of how to go about this:
p192
aVthe struggle against poverty in the world
p193
aVand the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions,
p194
aVall has a single, very simple solution.
p195
aa(lp196
VPeople say, "What's the solution?" Here it is.
p197
aVPut a price on carbon. We need a CO2 tax, revenue neutral,
p198
aVto replace taxation on employment, which was invented by Bismarck \u2014
p199
aVand some things have changed
p200
aVsince the 19th century.
p201
aVIn the poor world, we have to integrate the responses
p202
aVto poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis.
p203
aVPlans to fight poverty in Uganda
p204
aVare mooted, if we do not solve the climate crisis.
p205
aa(lp206
VBut responses can actually make a huge difference
p207
aVin the poor countries. This is a proposal
p208
aVthat has been talked about a lot in Europe.
p209
aVThis was from Nature magazine. These are concentrating
p210
aVsolar, renewable energy plants, linked in a so-called "supergrid"
p211
aVto supply all of the electrical power
p212
aVto Europe, largely from developing countries \u2014 high-voltage DC currents.
p213
aVThis is not pie in the sky; this can be done.
p214
aa(lp215
VWe need to do it for our own economy.
p216
aVThe latest figures show that the old model
p217
aVis not working. There are a lot of great investments
p218
aVthat you can make. If you are investing in tar sands
p219
aVor shale oil, then you have a portfolio
p220
aVthat is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets.
p221
aVAnd it is based on an old model.
p222
aVJunkies find veins in their toes when the ones
p223
aVin their arms and their legs collapse. Developing tar sands
p224
aVand coal shale is the equivalent. Here are just a few of the investments
p225
aVthat I personally think make sense.
p226
aVI have a stake in these, so I'll have a disclaimer there.
p227
aVBut geothermal, concentrating solar,
p228
aVadvanced photovoltaics, efficiency and conservation.
p229
aa(lp230
VYou've seen this slide before, but there's a change.
p231
aVThe only two countries that didn't ratify
p232
aV\u2014 and now there's only one. Australia had an election.
p233
aVAnd there was a campaign in Australia
p234
aVthat involved television and Internet and radio commercials
p235
aVto lift the sense of urgency for the people there.
p236
aVAnd we trained 250 people to give the slide show
p237
aVin every town and village and city in Australia.
p238
aVLot of other things contributed to it,
p239
aVbut the new Prime Minister announced that
p240
aVhis very first priority would be to change Australia's position
p241
aVon Kyoto, and he has. Now, they came to an awareness
p242
aVpartly because of the horrible drought that they have had.
p243
aVThis is Lake Lanier. My friend Heidi Cullen
p244
aVsaid that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names,
p245
aVwe'd call the one in the southeast now Katrina,
p246
aVand we would say it's headed toward Atlanta.
p247
aVWe can't wait for the kind of drought
p248
aVAustralia had to change our political culture.
p249
aVHere's more good news. The cities supporting Kyoto in the U.S.
p250
aVare up to 780 \u2014 and I thought I saw one go by there,
p251
aVjust to localize this \u2014 which is good news.
p252
aa(lp253
VNow, to close, we heard a couple of days ago
p254
aVabout the value of making individual heroism so commonplace
p255
aVthat it becomes banal or routine.
p256
aVWhat we need is another hero generation. Those of us who are alive
p257
aVin the United States of America
p258
aVtoday especially, but also the rest of the world,
p259
aVhave to somehow understand that history
p260
aVhas presented us with a choice \u2014 just as Jill [Bolte] Taylor was figuring out
p261
aVhow to save her life while she was distracted
p262
aVby the amazing experience that she was going through.
p263
aVWe now have a culture of distraction.
p264
aVBut we have a planetary emergency.
p265
aVAnd we have to find a way to create,
p266
aVin the generation of those alive today, a sense of generational mission.
p267
aVI wish I could find the words to convey this.
p268
aVThis was another hero generation
p269
aVthat brought democracy to the planet.
p270
aVAnother that ended slavery. And that gave women the right to vote.
p271
aVWe can do this. Don't tell me that we don't have the capacity to do it.
p272
aVIf we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq War,
p273
aVwe could be well on the way to solving this challenge.
p274
aVWe have the capacity to do it.
p275
aa(lp276
VOne final point: I'm optimistic, because I believe
p277
aVwe have the capacity, at moments of great challenge,
p278
aVto set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge
p279
aVthat history is presenting to us.
p280
aVSometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis
p281
aVby saying, "Oh, this is so terrible.
p282
aVWhat a burden we have." I would like to ask you
p283
aVto reframe that. How many generations
p284
aVin all of human history have had the opportunity
p285
aVto rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts?
p286
aVA challenge that can pull from us
p287
aVmore than we knew we could do? I think we ought to approach
p288
aVthis challenge with a sense of profound joy
p289
aVand gratitude that we are the generation
p290
aVabout which, a thousand years from now,
p291
aVphilharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate
p292
aVby saying, they were the ones that found it within themselves
p293
aVto solve this crisis and lay the basis
p294
aVfor a bright and optimistic human future.
p295
aa(lp296
VLet's do that. Thank you very much.
p297
aa(lp298
VChris Anderson: For so many people at TED, there is deep pain
p299
aVthat basically a design issue
p300
aVon a voting form \u2014
p301
aVone bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard
p302
aVlike that in the last eight years in a position
p303
aVwhere you could make these things come true.
p304
aVThat hurts.
p305
aa(lp306
VAl Gore: You have no idea. (Laughter)
p307
aa(lp308
VCA: When you look at what the leading candidates
p309
aVin your own party are doing now \u2014 I mean, there's \u2014
p310
aVare you excited by their plans on global warming?
p311
aa(lp312
VAG: The answer to the question is hard for me
p313
aVbecause, on the one hand, I think that
p314
aVwe should feel really great about the fact
p315
aVthat the Republican nominee \u2014 certain nominee \u2014
p316
aVJohn McCain, and both of the finalists
p317
aVfor the Democratic nomination \u2014 all three have a very different
p318
aVand forward-leaning position
p319
aVon the climate crisis. All three have offered leadership,
p320
aVand all three are very different from the approach taken
p321
aVby the current administration. And I think
p322
aVthat all three have also been responsible in
p323
aVputting forward plans and proposals. But the campaign dialogue that \u2014
p324
aVas illustrated by the questions \u2014
p325
aVthat was put together by the
p326
aVLeague of Conservation Voters, by the way, the analysis of all the questions \u2014
p327
aVand, by the way, the debates have all been
p328
aVsponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label,
p329
aV"Clean Coal." Has anybody noticed that?
p330
aVEvery single debate has been sponsored by "Clean Coal."
p331
aV"Now, even lower emissions!"
p332
aa(lp333
VThe richness and fullness of the dialogue
p334
aVin our democracy has not laid the basis
p335
aVfor the kind of bold initiative that is really needed.
p336
aVSo they're saying the right things and they may \u2014
p337
aVwhichever of them is elected \u2014 may do the right thing,
p338
aVbut let me tell you: when I came back from Kyoto
p339
aVin 1997, with a feeling of great happiness
p340
aVthat we'd gotten that breakthrough there,
p341
aVand then confronted the United States Senate,
p342
aVonly one out of 100 senators was willing to vote
p343
aVto confirm, to ratify that treaty. Whatever the candidates say
p344
aVhas to be laid alongside what the people say.
p345
aa(lp346
VThis challenge is part of the fabric
p347
aVof our whole civilization.
p348
aVCO2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization, literally.
p349
aVAnd now we mechanized that process. Changing that pattern
p350
aVrequires a scope, a scale, a speed of change
p351
aVthat is beyond what we have done in the past.
p352
aVSo that's why I began by saying,
p353
aVbe optimistic in what you do, but be an active citizen.
p354
aVDemand \u2014 change the light bulbs,
p355
aVbut change the laws. Change the global treaties.
p356
aVWe have to speak up. We have to solve this democracy \u2014 this \u2014
p357
aVWe have sclerosis in our democracy. And we have to change that.
p358
aVUse the Internet. Go on the Internet.
p359
aVConnect with people. Become very active as citizens.
p360
aVHave a moratorium \u2014 we shouldn't
p361
aVhave any new coal-fired generating plants
p362
aVthat aren't able to capture and store CO2, which means we have to
p363
aVquickly build these renewable sources.
p364
aVNow, nobody is talking on that scale. But I do believe
p365
aVthat between now and November, it is possible.
p366
aVThis Alliance for Climate Protection
p367
aVis going to launch a nationwide campaign \u2014
p368
aVgrassroots mobilization, television ads, Internet ads,
p369
aVradio, newspaper \u2014 with partnerships with everybody
p370
aVfrom the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen.
p371
aa(lp372
VWe need help. We need help.
p373
aa(lp374
VCA: In terms of your own personal role going forward,
p375
aVAl, is there something more than that
p376
aVyou would like to be doing?
p377
aa(lp378
VAG: I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer
p379
aVto that question. What can I do?
p380
aVBuckminster Fuller once wrote, "If the future
p381
aVof all human civilization depended on me, what would I do?
p382
aVHow would I be?" It does depend on all of us,
p383
aVbut again, not just with the light bulbs.
p384
aVWe, most of us here, are Americans. We have a democracy.
p385
aVWe can change things, but we have to actively change.
p386
aVWhat's needed really is a higher level of consciousness.
p387
aVAnd that's hard to \u2014
p388
aVthat's hard to create \u2014 but it is coming.
p389
aVThere's an old African proverb that some of you know
p390
aVthat says, "If you want to go quickly, go alone;
p391
aVif you want to go far, go together." We have to go far, quickly.
p392
aVSo we have to have a change in consciousness.
p393
aVA change in commitment. A new sense of urgency.
p394
aVA new appreciation for the privilege
p395
aVthat we have of undertaking this challenge.
p396
aa(lp397
VCA: Al Gore, thank you so much for coming to TED.
p398
aa(lp399
VAG: Thank you. Thank you very much.
