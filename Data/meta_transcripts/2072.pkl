VWhy does the universe exist?
p4
aVWhy is there \u2014 Okay. Okay. (Laughter)
p5
aVThis is a cosmic mystery. Be solemn.
p6
aVWhy is there a world, why are we in it,
p7
aVand why is there something rather than nothing at all?
p8
aVI mean, this is the super ultimate "why" question?
p9
aa(lp10
VSo I'm going to talk about the mystery of existence,
p11
aVthe puzzle of existence,
p12
aVwhere we are now in addressing it,
p13
aVand why you should care,
p14
aVand I hope you do care.
p15
aVThe philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said that
p16
aVthose who don't wonder about the contingency of their existence,
p17
aVof the contingency of the world's existence,
p18
aVare mentally deficient.
p19
aVThat's a little harsh, but still. (Laughter)
p20
aVSo this has been called the most sublime
p21
aVand awesome mystery,
p22
aVthe deepest and most far-reaching question
p23
aVman can pose.
p24
aVIt's obsessed great thinkers.
p25
aVLudwig Wittgenstein, perhaps the greatest
p26
aVphilosopher of the 20th century,
p27
aVwas astonished that there should be a world at all.
p28
aVHe wrote in his "Tractatus," Proposition 4.66,
p29
aV"It is not how things are in the world
p30
aVthat is the mystical,
p31
aVit's that the world exists."
p32
aVAnd if you don't like taking your epigrams
p33
aVfrom a philosopher, try a scientist.
p34
aVJohn Archibald Wheeler, one of the great physicists
p35
aVof the 20th century,
p36
aVthe teacher of Richard Feynman,
p37
aVthe coiner of the term "black hole,"
p38
aVhe said, "I want to know
p39
aVhow come the quantum,
p40
aVhow come the universe, how come existence?"
p41
aVAnd my friend Martin Amis \u2014
p42
aVsorry that I'll be doing a lot of name-dropping in this talk,
p43
aVso get used to it \u2014
p44
aVmy dear friend Martin Amis once said
p45
aVthat we're about five Einsteins away from answering
p46
aVthe mystery of where the universe came from.
p47
aVAnd I've no doubt there are five Einsteins
p48
aVin the audience tonight.
p49
aVAny Einsteins? Show of hands? No? No? No?
p50
aVNo Einsteins? Okay.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo this question, why is there something rather than nothing,
p53
aVthis sublime question, was posed rather late
p54
aVin intellectual history.
p55
aVIt was towards the end of the 17th century,
p56
aVthe philosopher Leibniz who asked it,
p57
aVa very smart guy, Leibniz,
p58
aVwho invented the calculus
p59
aVindependently of Isaac Newton, at about the same time,
p60
aVbut for Leibniz, who asked why is there something rather than nothing,
p61
aVthis was not a great mystery.
p62
aVHe either was or pretended to be
p63
aVan Orthodox Christian in his metaphysical outlook,
p64
aVand he said it's obvious why the world exists:
p65
aVbecause God created it.
p66
aVAnd God created, indeed, out of nothing at all.
p67
aVThat's how powerful God is.
p68
aVHe doesn't need any preexisting materials to fashion a world out of.
p69
aVHe can make it out of sheer nothingness,
p70
aVcreation ex nihilo.
p71
aVAnd by the way, this is what
p72
aVmost Americans today believe.
p73
aVThere is no mystery of existence for them.
p74
aVGod made it.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo let's put this in an equation.
p77
aVI don't have any slides so I'm going to mime my visuals,
p78
aVso use your imaginations.
p79
aVSo it's God + nothing = the world.
p80
aVOkay? Now that's the equation.
p81
aVAnd so maybe you don't believe in God.
p82
aVMaybe you're a scientific atheist
p83
aVor an unscientific atheist, and you don't believe in God,
p84
aVand you're not happy with it.
p85
aVBy the way, even if we have this equation,
p86
aVGod + nothing = the world,
p87
aVthere's already a problem:
p88
aVWhy does God exist?
p89
aVGod doesn't exist by logic alone
p90
aVunless you believe the ontological argument,
p91
aVand I hope you don't, because it's not a good argument.
p92
aVSo it's conceivable, if God were to exist,
p93
aVhe might wonder, I'm eternal, I'm all-powerful,
p94
aVbut where did I come from?
p95
aV(Laughter)
p96
aVWhence then am I?
p97
aVGod speaks in a more formal English.
p98
aV(Laughter)
p99
aVAnd so one theory is that God was so bored with
p100
aVpondering the puzzle of His own existence
p101
aVthat He created the world just to distract himself.
p102
aVBut anyway, let's forget about God.
p103
aVTake God out of the equation: We have
p104
aV________ + nothing = the world.
p105
aVNow, if you're a Buddhist,
p106
aVyou might want to stop right there,
p107
aVbecause essentially what you've got is
p108
aVnothing = the world,
p109
aVand by symmetry of identity, that means
p110
aVthe world = nothing. Okay?
p111
aVAnd to a Buddhist, the world is just a whole lot of nothing.
p112
aVIt's just a big cosmic vacuity.
p113
aVAnd we think there's a lot of something out there
p114
aVbut that's because we're enslaved by our desires.
p115
aVIf we let our desires melt away,
p116
aVwe'll see the world for what it truly is,
p117
aVa vacuity, nothingness,
p118
aVand we'll slip into this happy state of nirvana
p119
aVwhich has been defined as having
p120
aVjust enough life to enjoy being dead. (Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VSo that's the Buddhist thinking.
p123
aVBut I'm a Westerner, and I'm still concerned
p124
aVwith the puzzle of existence, so I've got
p125
aV________ + \u2014
p126
aVthis is going to get serious in a minute, so \u2014
p127
aV________ + nothing = the world.
p128
aVWhat are we going to put in that blank?
p129
aVWell, how about science?
p130
aVScience is our best guide to the nature of reality,
p131
aVand the most fundamental science is physics.
p132
aVThat tells us what naked reality really is,
p133
aVthat reveals what I call TAUFOTU,
p134
aVthe True And Ultimate Furniture Of The Universe.
p135
aVSo maybe physics can fill this blank,
p136
aVand indeed, since about the late 1960s or around 1970,
p137
aVphysicists have purported to give
p138
aVa purely scientific explanation of how
p139
aVa universe like ours could have popped into existence
p140
aVout of sheer nothingness,
p141
aVa quantum fluctuation out of the void.
p142
aVStephen Hawking is one of these physicists,
p143
aVmore recently Alex Vilenkin,
p144
aVand the whole thing has been popularized
p145
aVby another very fine physicist and friend of mine,
p146
aVLawrence Krauss, who wrote a book called
p147
aV"A Universe from Nothing,"
p148
aVand Lawrence thinks that he's given \u2014
p149
aVhe's a militant atheist, by the way,
p150
aVso he's gotten God out of the picture.
p151
aVThe laws of quantum field theory,
p152
aVthe state-of-the-art physics, can show how
p153
aVout of sheer nothingness,
p154
aVno space, no time, no matter, nothing,
p155
aVa little nugget of false vacuum
p156
aVcan fluctuate into existence,
p157
aVand then, by the miracle of inflation,
p158
aVblow up into this huge and variegated cosmos
p159
aVwe see around us.
p160
aa(lp161
VOkay, this is a really ingenious scenario.
p162
aVIt's very speculative. It's fascinating.
p163
aVBut I've got a big problem with it,
p164
aVand the problem is this:
p165
aVIt's a pseudo-religious point of view.
p166
aVNow, Lawrence thinks he's an atheist,
p167
aVbut he's still in thrall to a religious worldview.
p168
aVHe sees physical laws as being like divine commands.
p169
aVThe laws of quantum field theory for him
p170
aVare like fiat lux, "Let there be light."
p171
aVThe laws have some sort of ontological power or clout
p172
aVthat they can form the abyss,
p173
aVthat it's pregnant with being.
p174
aVThey can call a world into existence out of nothing.
p175
aVBut that's a very primitive view of what
p176
aVa physical law is, right?
p177
aVWe know that physical laws are actually
p178
aVgeneralized descriptions of patterns and regularities
p179
aVin the world.
p180
aVThey don't exist outside the world.
p181
aVThey don't have any ontic cloud of their own.
p182
aVThey can't call a world into existence
p183
aVout of nothingness.
p184
aVThat's a very primitive view
p185
aVof what a scientific law is.
p186
aVAnd if you don't believe me on this,
p187
aVlisten to Stephen Hawking,
p188
aVwho himself put forward a model of the cosmos
p189
aVthat was self-contained,
p190
aVdidn't require any outside cause, any creator,
p191
aVand after proposing this,
p192
aVHawking admitted that he was still puzzled.
p193
aVHe said, this model is just equations.
p194
aVWhat breathes fire into the equations
p195
aVand creates a world for them to describe?
p196
aVHe was puzzled by this,
p197
aVso equations themselves can't do the magic,
p198
aVcan't resolve the puzzle of existence.
p199
aVAnd besides, even if the laws could do that,
p200
aVwhy this set of laws?
p201
aVWhy quantum field theory that describes
p202
aVa universe with a certain number of forces
p203
aVand particles and so forth?
p204
aVWhy not a completely different set of laws?
p205
aVThere are many, many mathematically consistent sets of laws.
p206
aVWhy not no laws at all? Why not sheer nothingness?
p207
aa(lp208
VSo this is a problem, believe it or not,
p209
aVthat reflective physicists really think a lot about,
p210
aVand at this point they tend to go metaphysical,
p211
aVsay, well, maybe the set of laws
p212
aVthat describes our universe,
p213
aVit's just one set of laws
p214
aVand it describes one part of reality,
p215
aVbut maybe every consistent set of laws
p216
aVdescribes another part of reality,
p217
aVand in fact all possible physical worlds
p218
aVreally exist, they're all out there.
p219
aVWe just see a little tiny part of reality
p220
aVthat's described by the laws of quantum field theory,
p221
aVbut there are many, many other worlds,
p222
aVparts of reality that are described
p223
aVby vastly different theories
p224
aVthat are different from ours in ways we can't imagine,
p225
aVthat are inconceivably exotic.
p226
aVSteven Weinberg, the father
p227
aVof the standard model of particle physics,
p228
aVhas actually flirted with this idea himself,
p229
aVthat all possible realities actually exist.
p230
aVAlso, a younger physicist, Max Tegmark,
p231
aVwho believes that all mathematical structures exist,
p232
aVand mathematical existence is the same thing
p233
aVas physical existence,
p234
aVso we have this vastly rich multiverse
p235
aVthat encompasses every logical possibility.
p236
aa(lp237
VNow, in taking this metaphysical way out,
p238
aVthese physicists and also philosophers are actually
p239
aVreaching back to a very old idea
p240
aVthat goes back to Plato.
p241
aVIt's the principle of plenitude or fecundity,
p242
aVor the great chain of being,
p243
aVthat reality is actually as full as possible.
p244
aVIt's as far removed from nothingness
p245
aVas it could possibly be.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo we have these two extremes now.
p248
aVWe have sheer nothingness on one side,
p249
aVand we have this vision of a reality
p250
aVthat encompasses every conceivable world
p251
aVat the other extreme: the fullest possible reality,
p252
aVnothingness, the simplest possible reality.
p253
aVNow what's in between these two extremes?
p254
aVThere are all kinds of intermediate realities
p255
aVthat include some things and leave out others.
p256
aVSo one of these intermediate realities
p257
aVis, say, the most mathematically elegant reality,
p258
aVthat leaves out the inelegant bits,
p259
aVthe ugly asymmetries and so forth.
p260
aVNow, there are some physicists who will tell you
p261
aVthat we're actually living in the most elegant reality.
p262
aVI think that Brian Greene is in the audience,
p263
aVand he has written a book called "The Elegant Universe."
p264
aVHe claims that the universe we live in mathematically
p265
aVis very elegant.
p266
aVDon't believe him. (Laughter)
p267
aVIt's a pious hope, I wish it were true,
p268
aVbut I think the other day he admitted to me
p269
aVit's really an ugly universe.
p270
aVIt's stupidly constructed,
p271
aVit's got way too many arbitrary coupling constants
p272
aVand mass ratios
p273
aVand superfluous families of elementary particles,
p274
aVand what the hell is dark energy?
p275
aVIt's a stick and bubble gum contraption.
p276
aVIt's not an elegant universe. (Laughter)
p277
aVAnd then there's the best of all possible worlds
p278
aVin an ethical sense.
p279
aVYou should get solemn now,
p280
aVbecause a world in which sentient beings
p281
aVdon't suffer needlessly,
p282
aVin which there aren't things like
p283
aVchildhood cancer or the Holocaust.
p284
aVThis is an ethical conception.
p285
aVAnyway, so between nothingness
p286
aVand the fullest possible reality,
p287
aVvarious special realities.
p288
aVNothingness is special. It's the simplest.
p289
aVThen there's the most elegant possible reality.
p290
aVThat's special.
p291
aVThe fullest possible reality, that's special.
p292
aa(lp293
VBut what are we leaving out here?
p294
aVThere's also just the crummy,
p295
aVgeneric realities
p296
aVthat aren't special in any way,
p297
aVthat are sort of random.
p298
aVThey're infinitely removed from nothingness,
p299
aVbut they fall infinitely short of complete fullness.
p300
aVThey're a mixture of chaos and order,
p301
aVof mathematical elegance and ugliness.
p302
aVSo I would describe these realities
p303
aVas an infinite, mediocre, incomplete mess,
p304
aVa generic reality, a kind of cosmic junk shot.
p305
aVAnd these realities,
p306
aVis there a deity in any of these realities?
p307
aVMaybe, but the deity isn't perfect
p308
aVlike the Judeo-Christian deity.
p309
aVThe deity isn't all-good and all-powerful.
p310
aVIt might be instead 100 percent malevolent
p311
aVbut only 80 percent effective,
p312
aVwhich pretty much describes the world we see around us, I think. (Laughter)
p313
aVSo I would like to propose that the resolution
p314
aVto the mystery of existence
p315
aVis that the reality we exist in
p316
aVis one of these generic realities.
p317
aVReality has to turn out some way.
p318
aVIt can either turn out to be nothing
p319
aVor everything or something in between.
p320
aVSo if it has some special feature,
p321
aVlike being really elegant or really full
p322
aVor really simple, like nothingness,
p323
aVthat would require an explanation.
p324
aVBut if it's just one of these random, generic realities,
p325
aVthere's no further explanation for it.
p326
aVAnd indeed, I would say
p327
aVthat's the reality we live in.
p328
aVThat's what science is telling us.
p329
aVAt the beginning of the week,
p330
aVwe got the exciting information that
p331
aVthe theory of inflation, which predicts a big,
p332
aVinfinite, messy, arbitrary, pointless reality,
p333
aVit's like a big frothing champagne
p334
aVcoming out of a bottle endlessly,
p335
aVa vast universe, mostly a wasteland
p336
aVwith little pockets of charm and order and peace,
p337
aVthis has been confirmed,
p338
aVthis inflationary scenario, by the observations
p339
aVmade by radio telescopes in Antarctica
p340
aVthat looked at the signature of the gravitational waves
p341
aVfrom just before the Big Bang.
p342
aVI'm sure you all know about this.
p343
aVSo anyway, I think there's some evidence
p344
aVthat this really is the reality that we're stuck with.
p345
aa(lp346
VNow, why should you care?
p347
aVWell \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p348
aVthe question, "Why does the world exist?"
p349
aVthat's the cosmic question, it sort of rhymes
p350
aVwith a more intimate question:
p351
aVWhy do I exist? Why do you exist?
p352
aVyou know, our existence would seem to be amazingly improbable,
p353
aVbecause there's an enormous number of genetically possible humans,
p354
aVif you can compute it by looking at
p355
aVthe number of the genes and the number of alleles and so forth,
p356
aVand a back-of-the-envelope calculation will tell you
p357
aVthere are about 10 to the 10,000th
p358
aVpossible humans, genetically.
p359
aVThat's between a googol and a googolplex.
p360
aVAnd the number of the actual humans that have existed
p361
aVis 100 billion, maybe 50 billion,
p362
aVan infinitesimal fraction, so all of us,
p363
aVwe've won this amazing cosmic lottery.
p364
aVWe're here. Okay.
p365
aa(lp366
VSo what kind of reality do we want to live in?
p367
aVDo we want to live in a special reality?
p368
aVWhat if we were living in the most elegant possible reality?
p369
aVImagine the existential pressure on us
p370
aVto live up to that, to be elegant,
p371
aVnot to pull down the tone of it.
p372
aVOr, what if we were living in the fullest possible reality?
p373
aVWell then our existence would be guaranteed,
p374
aVbecause every possible thing
p375
aVexists in that reality,
p376
aVbut our choices would be meaningless.
p377
aVIf I really struggle morally and agonize
p378
aVand I decide to do the right thing,
p379
aVwhat difference does it make,
p380
aVbecause there are an infinite number
p381
aVof versions of me
p382
aValso doing the right thing
p383
aVand an infinite number doing the wrong thing.
p384
aVSo my choices are meaningless.
p385
aVSo we don't want to live in that special reality.
p386
aVAnd as for the special reality of nothingness,
p387
aVwe wouldn't be having this conversation.
p388
aVSo I think living in a generic reality that's mediocre,
p389
aVthere are nasty bits and nice bits
p390
aVand we could make the nice bits bigger
p391
aVand the nasty bits smaller
p392
aVand that gives us a kind of purpose in life.
p393
aVThe universe is absurd,
p394
aVbut we can still construct a purpose,
p395
aVand that's a pretty good one,
p396
aVand the overall mediocrity of reality
p397
aVkind of resonates nicely with the mediocrity
p398
aVwe all feel in the core of our being.
p399
aVAnd I know you feel it.
p400
aVI know you're all special,
p401
aVbut you're still kind of secretly mediocre,
p402
aVdon't you think?
p403
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p404
aa(lp405
VSo anyway, you may say, this  puzzle, the mystery of existence,
p406
aVit's just silly mystery-mongering.
p407
aVYou're not astonished at the existence of the universe
p408
aVand you're in good company.
p409
aVBertrand Russell said,
p410
aV"I should say the universe is just there, and that's all."
p411
aVJust a brute fact.
p412
aVAnd my professor at Columbia, Sidney Morgenbesser,
p413
aVa great philosophical wag,
p414
aVwhen I said to him, "Professor Morgenbesser,
p415
aVwhy is there something rather than nothing?"
p416
aVAnd he said, "Oh, even if there was nothing,
p417
aVyou still wouldn't be satisfied."
p418
aa(lp419
VSo \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 okay.
p420
aVSo you're not astonished. I don't care.
p421
aVBut I will tell you something to conclude
p422
aVthat I guarantee you will astonish you,
p423
aVbecause it's astonished all of the brilliant,
p424
aVwonderful people I've met at this TED conference,
p425
aVwhen I've told them, and it's this:
p426
aVNever in my life have I had a cell phone.
p427
aVThank you.
