VAmerica's public energy conversation
p4
aVboils down to this question:
p5
aVWould you rather die of A) oil wars,
p6
aVor B) climate change,
p7
aVor C) nuclear holocaust,
p8
aVor D) all of the above?
p9
aVOh, I missed one: or E) none of the above?
p10
aVThat's the one we're not normally offered.
p11
aVWhat if we could make energy do our work
p12
aVwithout working our undoing?
p13
aVCould we have fuel without fear?
p14
aVCould we reinvent fire?
p15
aa(lp16
VYou see, fire made us human;
p17
aVfossil fuels made us modern.
p18
aVBut now we need a new fire
p19
aVthat makes us safe, secure, healthy and durable.
p20
aVLet's see how.
p21
aa(lp22
VFour-fifths of the world's energy
p23
aVstill comes from burning each year
p24
aVfour cubic miles of the rotted remains
p25
aVof primeval swamp goo.
p26
aVThose fossil fuels
p27
aVhave built our civilization.
p28
aVThey've created our wealth.
p29
aVThey've enriched the lives of billions.
p30
aVBut they also have rising costs
p31
aVto our security, economy, health and environment
p32
aVthat are starting to erode, if not outweigh their benefits.
p33
aa(lp34
VSo we need a new fire.
p35
aVAnd switching from the old fire to the new fire
p36
aVmeans changing two big stories about oil and electricity,
p37
aVeach of which puts two-fifths of the fossil carbon in the air.
p38
aVBut they're really quite distinct.
p39
aa(lp40
VLess than one percent of our electricity is made from oil \u2014
p41
aValthough almost half is made from coal.
p42
aVTheir uses are quite concentrated.
p43
aVThree-fourths of our oil fuel is transportation.
p44
aVThree-fourths of our electricity powers buildings.
p45
aVAnd the rest of both runs factories.
p46
aVSo very efficient vehicles, buildings and factories
p47
aVsave oil and coal,
p48
aVand also natural gas that can displace both of them.
p49
aa(lp50
VBut today's energy system is not just inefficient,
p51
aVit is also disconnected,
p52
aVaging, dirty and insecure.
p53
aVSo it needs refurbishment.
p54
aVBy 2050 though, it could become efficient,
p55
aVconnected and distributed
p56
aVwith elegantly frugal
p57
aVautos, factories and buildings
p58
aVall relying on a modern, secure
p59
aVand resilient electricity system.
p60
aa(lp61
VWe can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050
p62
aVand use one-third less natural gas
p63
aVwhile switching to efficient use
p64
aVand renewable supply.
p65
aVThis could cost, by 2050,
p66
aVfive trillion dollars less in net present value,
p67
aVthat is expressed as a lump sum today,
p68
aVthan business as usual \u2014
p69
aVassuming that carbon emissions
p70
aVand all other hidden or external costs are worth zero \u2014
p71
aVa conservatively low estimate.
p72
aVYet this cheaper energy system
p73
aVcould support 158 percent bigger U.S. economy
p74
aVall without needing oil or coal,
p75
aVor for that matter nuclear energy.
p76
aVMoreover, this transition needs no new inventions
p77
aVand no acts of Congress
p78
aVand no new federal taxes, mandate subsidies or laws
p79
aVand running Washington gridlock.
p80
aa(lp81
VLet me say that again.
p82
aVI'm going to tell you how to get the United States
p83
aVcompletely off oil and coal, five trillion dollars cheaper
p84
aVwith no act of Congress
p85
aVled by business for profit.
p86
aVIn other words, we're going to use our most effective institutions \u2014
p87
aVprivate enterprise co-evolving with civil society
p88
aVand sped by military innovation
p89
aVto go around our least effective institutions.
p90
aVAnd whether you care most
p91
aVabout profits and jobs and competitive advantage
p92
aVor national security, or environmental stewardship
p93
aVand climate protection and public health,
p94
aVreinventing fire makes sense and makes money.
p95
aa(lp96
VGeneral Eisenhower reputedly said
p97
aVthat enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem
p98
aVmakes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies.
p99
aVSo in reinventing fire,
p100
aVwe integrated all four sectors that use energy \u2014
p101
aVtransportation, buildings, industry and electricity \u2014
p102
aVand we integrated four kinds of innovation,
p103
aVnot just technology and policy,
p104
aVbut also design and business strategy.
p105
aVThose combinations yield
p106
aVvery much more than the sum of the parts,
p107
aVespecially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities.
p108
aa(lp109
VOil costs our economy two billion dollars a day,
p110
aVplus another four billion dollars a day
p111
aVin hidden economic and military costs,
p112
aVraising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP.
p113
aVOur mobility fuel goes three-fifths to automobiles.
p114
aVSo let's start by making autos oil free.
p115
aVTwo-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car
p116
aVis caused by its weight.
p117
aVAnd every unit of energy you save at the wheels,
p118
aVby taking out weight or drag,
p119
aVsaves seven units in the tank,
p120
aVbecause you don't have to waste six units
p121
aVgetting the energy to the wheels.
p122
aa(lp123
VUnfortunately, over the past quarter century,
p124
aVepidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars
p125
aVgain weight twice as fast as we have.
p126
aVBut today, ultralight, ultrastrong materials,
p127
aVlike carbon fiber composites,
p128
aVcan make dramatic weight savings snowball
p129
aVand can make cars simpler and cheaper to build.
p130
aVLighter and more slippery autos
p131
aVneed less force to move them,
p132
aVso their engines get smaller.
p133
aVIndeed, that sort of vehicle fitness
p134
aVthen makes electric propulsion affordable
p135
aVbecause the batteries or fuel cells
p136
aValso get smaller and lighter and cheaper.
p137
aVSo sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today,
p138
aVwhile the driving cost, even from the start,
p139
aVis very much lower.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo these innovations together can transform automakers
p142
aVfrom wringing tiny savings
p143
aVout of Victorian engine and seal-stamping technologies
p144
aVto the steeply falling costs
p145
aVof three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other \u2014
p146
aVnamely ultralight materials, making them into structures
p147
aVand electric propulsion.
p148
aVThe sales can grow and the prices fall even faster
p149
aVwith temporary feebates,
p150
aVthat is rebates for efficient new autos
p151
aVpaid for by fees on inefficient ones.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd just in the first two years
p154
aVthe biggest of Europe's five feebate programs
p155
aVhas tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency.
p156
aVThe resulting shift to electric autos
p157
aVis going to be as game-changing
p158
aVas shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers.
p159
aVOf course, computers and electronics
p160
aVare now America's biggest industry,
p161
aVwhile typewriter makers have vanished.
p162
aVSo vehicle fitness
p163
aVopens a new automotive competitive strategy
p164
aVthat can double the oil savings over the next 40 years,
p165
aVbut then also make electrification affordable,
p166
aVand that displaces the rest of the oil.
p167
aa(lp168
VAmerica could lead this next automotive revolution.
p169
aVCurrently the leader is Germany.
p170
aVLast year, Volkswagen announced
p171
aVthat by next year they'll be producing
p172
aVthis carbon fiber plugin hybrid
p173
aVgetting 230 miles a gallon.
p174
aVAlso last year, BMW announced
p175
aVthis carbon fiber electric car,
p176
aVthey said that its carbon fiber is paid for
p177
aVby needing fewer batteries.
p178
aVAnd they said, "We do not intend to be a typewriter maker."
p179
aVAudi claimed it's going to beat them both by a year.
p180
aa(lp181
VSeven years ago, an even faster and cheaper
p182
aVAmerican manufacturing technology
p183
aVwas used to make this little carbon fiber test part,
p184
aVwhich doubles as a carbon cap.
p185
aV(Laughter)
p186
aVIn one minute \u2014 and you can tell from the sound
p187
aVhow immensely stiff and strong it is.
p188
aVDon't worry about dropping it, it's tougher than titanium.
p189
aVTom Friedman actually whacked it as hard as he could with a sledgehammer
p190
aVwithout even scuffing it.
p191
aa(lp192
VBut such manufacturing techniques
p193
aVcan scale to automotive speed and cost
p194
aVwith aerospace performance.
p195
aVThey can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos.
p196
aVThey can save lives
p197
aVbecause this stuff can absorb
p198
aVup to 12 times as much crash energy per pound as steel.
p199
aVIf we made all of our autos this way,
p200
aVit would save oil equivalent to finding
p201
aVone and a half Saudi Arabias, or half an OPEC,
p202
aVby drilling in the Detroit formation, a very prospective play.
p203
aVAnd all those mega-barrels under Detroit
p204
aVcost an average of 18 bucks a barrel.
p205
aVThey are all-American, carbon-free
p206
aVand inexhaustible.
p207
aa(lp208
VThe same physics and the same business logic
p209
aValso apply to big vehicles.
p210
aVIn the five years ending with 2010,
p211
aVWalmart saved 60 percent of the fuel per ton-mile
p212
aVin its giant fleet of heavy trucks
p213
aVthrough better logistics and design.
p214
aVBut just the technological savings in heavy trucks
p215
aVcan get to two-thirds.
p216
aVAnd combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes,
p217
aVnow on the drawing board,
p218
aVcan save close to a trillion dollars.
p219
aa(lp220
VAlso today's military revolution in energy efficiency
p221
aVis going to speed up all of these civilian advances
p222
aVin much the same way that military R&D
p223
aVhas given us the Internet, the Global Positioning System
p224
aVand the jet engine and microchip industries.
p225
aVAs we design and build vehicles better,
p226
aVwe can also use them smarter
p227
aVby harnessing four powerful techniques
p228
aVfor eliminating needless driving.
p229
aVInstead of just seeing the travel grow,
p230
aVwe can use innovative pricing,
p231
aVcharging for road infrastructure by the mile, not by the gallon.
p232
aa(lp233
VWe can use some smart IT to enhance transit
p234
aVand enable car sharing and ride sharing.
p235
aVWe can allow smart and lucrative growth models
p236
aVthat help people already be near where they want to be,
p237
aVso they don't need to go somewhere else.
p238
aVAnd we can use smart IT
p239
aVto make traffic free-flowing.
p240
aVTogether, those things can give us the same or better access
p241
aVwith 46 to 84 percent less driving,
p242
aVsaving another 0.4 trillion dollars,
p243
aVplus 0.3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively.
p244
aa(lp245
VSo 40 years hence, when you add it all up,
p246
aVa far more mobile U.S. economy
p247
aVcan use no oil.
p248
aVSaving or displacing barrels for 25 bucks
p249
aVrather than buying them for over a hundred,
p250
aVadds up to a $4 trillion net saving
p251
aVcounting all the hidden costs at zero.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo to get mobility without oil,
p254
aVto phase out the oil,
p255
aVwe can get efficient and then switch fuels.
p256
aVThose 125 to 240 mile-per-gallon-equivalent autos
p257
aVcan use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells,
p258
aVelectricity and advanced biofuels.
p259
aVThe trucks and planes can realistically use
p260
aVhydrogen or advanced biofuels.
p261
aVThe trucks could even use natural gas.
p262
aVBut no vehicles will need oil.
p263
aVAnd the most biofuel we might need,
p264
aVjust three million barrels a day,
p265
aVcan be made two-thirds from waste
p266
aVwithout displacing any cropland
p267
aVand without harming soil or climate.
p268
aa(lp269
VOur team speeds up these kinds of oil savings
p270
aVby what we call "institutional acupuncture."
p271
aVWe figure out where the business logic
p272
aVis congested and not flowing properly,
p273
aVwe stick little needles in it to get it flowing,
p274
aVworking with partners like Ford and Walmart and the Pentagon.
p275
aa(lp276
VAnd the long transition is already well under way.
p277
aVIn fact, three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil,
p278
aVnot in supply, but in demand.
p279
aVAnd Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peak around 2016.
p280
aa(lp281
VIn other words, oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices
p282
aVbefore it becomes unavailable even at high prices.
p283
aVBut the electrified vehicles
p284
aVdon't need to burden the electricity grid.
p285
aVRather, when smart autos exchange electricity and information
p286
aVthrough smart buildings with smart grids,
p287
aVthey're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage
p288
aVthat help the grid integrate
p289
aVvarying solar and wind power.
p290
aa(lp291
VSo the electrified autos
p292
aVmake the auto and electricity problems
p293
aVeasier to solve together than separately.
p294
aVAnd they also converge the oil story
p295
aVwith our second big story,
p296
aVsaving electricity and then making it differently.
p297
aVAnd those twin revolutions in electricity
p298
aVwill bring to that sector
p299
aVmore numerous and profound and diverse disruptions
p300
aVthan any other sector,
p301
aVbecause we've got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-on
p302
aVwith 20th and 19th century institutions, rules and cultures.
p303
aVChanging how we make electricity gets easier
p304
aVif we need less of it.
p305
aVMost of it now is wasted
p306
aVand the technologies for saving it
p307
aVkeep improving faster than we're installing them.
p308
aVSo the unbought efficiency resource
p309
aVkeeps getting ever bigger and cheaper.
p310
aa(lp311
VBut as efficiency in buildings and industry
p312
aVstarts to grow faster than the economy,
p313
aVAmerica's electricity use could actually shrink,
p314
aVeven with the little extra use required
p315
aVfor those efficient electrified autos.
p316
aVAnd we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends.
p317
aa(lp318
VOver the next 40 years, buildings,
p319
aVwhich use three-quarters of the electricity,
p320
aVcan triple or quadruple their energy productivity,
p321
aVsaving 1.4 trillion dollars, net present value,
p322
aVwith a 33 percent internal rate of return
p323
aVor in English,
p324
aVthe savings are worth four times what they cost.
p325
aVAnd industry can accelerate too,
p326
aVdoubling its energy productivity
p327
aVwith a 21 percent internal rate of return.
p328
aVThe key is a disruptive innovation
p329
aVthat we call integrative design
p330
aVthat often makes very big energy savings
p331
aVcost less than small or no savings.
p332
aVThat is, it can give you expanding returns,
p333
aVnot diminishing returns.
p334
aa(lp335
VThat is how our 2010 retrofit
p336
aVis saving over two-fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building \u2014
p337
aVremanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site
p338
aVinto super windows that pass light, but reflect heat.
p339
aVplus better lights and office equipment and such
p340
aVcut the maximum cooling load by a third.
p341
aVAnd then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones
p342
aVsaved 17 million dollars of
p343
aVcapital cost, which helped pay for the other improvements
p344
aVand reduce the payback to just three years.
p345
aVIntegrative design can also increase
p346
aVenergy savings in industry.
p347
aVDow's billion-dollar efficiency investment
p348
aVhas already returned nine billion dollars.
p349
aa(lp350
VBut industry as a whole has another half-trillion dollars
p351
aVof energy still to save.
p352
aVFor example, three-fifths of the world's electricity runs motors.
p353
aVHalf of that runs pumps and fans.
p354
aVAnd those can all be made more efficient,
p355
aVand the motors that turn them
p356
aVcan have their system efficiency roughly doubled
p357
aVby integrating 35 improvements, paying back in about a year.
p358
aa(lp359
VBut first we ought to be capturing bigger, cheaper savings
p360
aVthat are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks.
p361
aVFor example, pumps, the biggest use of motors,
p362
aVmove liquid through pipes.
p363
aVBut a standard industrial pumping loop
p364
aVwas redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy,
p365
aVnot by getting better pumps,
p366
aVbut just by replacing long, thin, crooked pipes
p367
aVwith fat, short, straight pipes.
p368
aVThis is not about new technology,
p369
aVit's just rearranging our metal furniture.
p370
aVOf course, it also shrinks the pumping equipment
p371
aVand its capital costs.
p372
aa(lp373
VSo what do such savings mean
p374
aVfor the electricity that is three-fifths used in motors?
p375
aVWell, from the coal burned at the power plant
p376
aVthrough all these compounding losses,
p377
aVonly a tenth of the fuel energy
p378
aVactually ends up coming out the pipe as flow.
p379
aVBut now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards,
p380
aVand every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe
p381
aVsaves 10 units of fuel cost, pollution
p382
aVand what Hunter Lovins calls "global weirding"
p383
aVback at the power plant.
p384
aVAnd of course, as you go back upstream,
p385
aVthe components get smaller and therefore cheaper.
p386
aa(lp387
VOur team has lately found such snowballing energy savings
p388
aVin more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns \u2014
p389
aVeverything from data centers and chip fabs
p390
aVto mines and refineries.
p391
aVTypically our retrofit designs
p392
aVsave about 30 to 60 percent of the energy
p393
aVand pay back in a few years,
p394
aVwhile the new facility designs save 40 to 90-odd percent
p395
aVwith generally lower capital cost.
p396
aa(lp397
VNow needing less electricity
p398
aVwould ease and speed
p399
aVthe shift to new sources of electricity, chiefly renewables.
p400
aVChina leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost.
p401
aVIn fact, these solar power module costs
p402
aVhave just fallen off the bottom of the chart.
p403
aVAnd Germany now has more solar workers
p404
aVthan America has steel workers.
p405
aVAlready in about 20 states
p406
aVprivate installers will come
p407
aVput those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down
p408
aVand beat your utility bill.
p409
aVSuch unregulated products
p410
aVcould ultimately add up to a virtual utility
p411
aVthat bypasses your electric company
p412
aVjust as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company.
p413
aVAnd this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee-jeebees
p414
aVand it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams.
p415
aa(lp416
VRenewables are no longer a fringe activity.
p417
aVFor each of the past four years
p418
aVhalf of the world's new generating capacity
p419
aVhas been renewable,
p420
aVmainly lately in developing countries.
p421
aVIn 2010, renewables other than big hydro,
p422
aVparticularly wind and solar cells,
p423
aVgot 151 billion dollars of private investment,
p424
aVand they actually surpassed the total installed capacity
p425
aVof nuclear power in the world
p426
aVby adding 60 billion watts in that one year.
p427
aVThat happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity
p428
aVthat the world can now make every year \u2014
p429
aVa number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year.
p430
aVIn contrast, the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity
p431
aVand the orders behind those keep fading
p432
aVbecause they cost too much and they have too much financial risk.
p433
aVIn fact in this country,
p434
aVno new nuclear power plant
p435
aVhas been able to raise any private construction capital,
p436
aVdespite seven years of 100-plus percent subsidies.
p437
aa(lp438
VSo how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants?
p439
aVWell efficiency and gas can displace them all
p440
aVat just below their operating cost
p441
aVand, combined with renewables, can displace them more than 23 times
p442
aVat less than their replacement cost.
p443
aVBut we only need to replace them once.
p444
aVWe're often told though
p445
aVthat only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on,
p446
aVbecause they're 24/7,
p447
aVwhereas wind and solar power are variable,
p448
aVand hence supposedly unreliable.
p449
aa(lp450
VActually no generator is 24/7. They all break.
p451
aVAnd when a big plant goes down,
p452
aVyou lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds,
p453
aVoften for weeks or months, often without warning.
p454
aVThat is exactly why we've designed the grid
p455
aVto back up failed plants with working plants.
p456
aVAnd in exactly the same way,
p457
aVthe grid can handle wind and solar power's
p458
aVforecastable variations.
p459
aa(lp460
VHourly simulations
p461
aVshow that largely or wholly renewable grids
p462
aVcan deliver highly reliable power
p463
aVwhen they're forecasted,
p464
aVintegrated and diversified
p465
aVby both type and location.
p466
aVAnd that's true both for continental areas like the U.S. or Europe
p467
aVand for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid.
p468
aVThat is how, for example,
p469
aVfour German states in 2010
p470
aVwere 43 to 52 percent wind powered.
p471
aVPortugal was 45 percent renewable powered,
p472
aVDenmark 36.
p473
aVAnd it's how all of Europe can shift
p474
aVto renewable electricity.
p475
aVIn America, our aging, dirty and insecure power system
p476
aVhas to be replaced anyway by 2050.
p477
aVAnd whatever we replace it with
p478
aVis going to cost about the same,
p479
aVabout six trillion dollars at present value \u2014
p480
aVwhether we buy more of what we've got
p481
aVor new nuclear and so-called clean coal,
p482
aVor renewables that are more or less centralized.
p483
aa(lp484
VBut those four futures at the same cost
p485
aVdiffer profoundly in their risks,
p486
aVaround national security,
p487
aVfuel, water, finance, technology,
p488
aVclimate and health.
p489
aVFor example, our over-centralized grid
p490
aVis very vulnerable to cascading
p491
aVand potentially economy-shattering blackouts
p492
aVcaused by bad space weather or other natural disasters
p493
aVor a terrorist attack.
p494
aVBut that blackout risk disappears,
p495
aVand all of the other risks are best managed,
p496
aVwith distributed renewables
p497
aVorganized into local micro-grids that normally interconnect,
p498
aVbut can stand alone at need.
p499
aVThat is, they can disconnect fractally
p500
aVand then reconnect seamlessly.
p501
aa(lp502
VThat approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting
p503
aVfor its own power supply.
p504
aVThey think they need that; how about the rest of us that they're defending?
p505
aVWe want our stuff to work too.
p506
aVAt about the same cost as business as usual,
p507
aVthis would maximize national security,
p508
aVcustomer choice, entrepreneurial opportunity
p509
aVand innovation.
p510
aa(lp511
VTogether, efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply
p512
aVare starting to transform the whole electricity sector.
p513
aVTraditionally utilities build
p514
aVa lot of giant coal and nuclear plants
p515
aVand a bunch of big gas plants
p516
aVand maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables.
p517
aVAnd those utilities were rewarded,
p518
aVas they still are in 34 states,
p519
aVfor selling you more electricity.
p520
aVHowever, especially where regulators
p521
aVare now instead rewarding cutting your bills,
p522
aVthe investments are shifting radically
p523
aVtoward efficiency, demand response, cogeneration,
p524
aVrenewables and ways to knit them all together reliably
p525
aVwith less transmission
p526
aVand little or no bulk electricity storage.
p527
aa(lp528
VSo our energy future is not fate, but choice,
p529
aVand that choice is very flexible.
p530
aVIn 1976, for example,
p531
aVgovernment and industry insisted
p532
aVthat the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP
p533
aVcould never go down.
p534
aVAnd I heretically suggested it could go down several-fold.
p535
aVWell that's what's actually happened so far.
p536
aVIt's fallen by half.
p537
aVBut with today's much better technologies,
p538
aVmore mature delivery channels and integrative design,
p539
aVwe can do far more and even cheaper.
p540
aa(lp541
VSo to solve the energy problem,
p542
aVwe just needed to enlarge it.
p543
aVAnd the results may at first seem incredible,
p544
aVbut as Marshall McLuhan said,
p545
aV"Only puny secrets need protection.
p546
aVBig discoveries are protected by public incredulity."
p547
aVNow combine the electricity and oil revolutions,
p548
aVboth driven by modern efficiency,
p549
aVand you get the really big story: reinventing fire,
p550
aVwhere business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets
p551
aVcan lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050,
p552
aVsaving 5 trillion dollars,
p553
aVgrowing the economy 2.6-fold,
p554
aVstrengthening out national security,
p555
aVoh, and by the way, by getting rid of the oil and coal,
p556
aVreducing the fossil carbon emissions by 82 to 86 percent.
p557
aa(lp558
VNow if you like any of those outcomes,
p559
aVyou can support reinventing fire
p560
aVwithout needing to like all of them
p561
aVand without needing to agree about which of them is most important.
p562
aVSo focusing on outcomes, not motives,
p563
aVcan turn gridlock and conflict
p564
aVinto a unifying solution to America's energy challenge.
p565
aVThis also turns out to be the best way
p566
aVto cope with global challenges \u2014
p567
aVclimate change, nuclear proliferation,
p568
aVenergy insecurity, energy poverty \u2014
p569
aVall of which make us less safe.
p570
aa(lp571
VNow our team at RMI helps smart companies
p572
aVto get unstuck and speed this journey
p573
aVvia six sectoral initiatives, with some more hatching.
p574
aVOf course there's still a lot of old thinking out there too.
p575
aVFormer oil man Maurice Strong said,
p576
aV"Not all the fossils are in the fuel."
p577
aVBut as Edgar Woolard, who used to chair Dupont, reminds us,
p578
aV"Companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem
p579
aVbecause," he said," they simply won't be around long-term."
p580
aa(lp581
VI've described not just a once-in-a-civilization
p582
aVbusiness opportunity,
p583
aVbut one of the most profound transitions
p584
aVin the history of our species.
p585
aVWe humans are inventing a new fire,
p586
aVnot dug from below,
p587
aVbut flowing from above;
p588
aVnot scarce, but bountiful;
p589
aVnot local, but everywhere;
p590
aVnot transient, but permanent;
p591
aVnot costly, but free.
p592
aVAnd but for a little transitional tail of natural gas
p593
aVand a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure,
p594
aVthis new fire is flameless.
p595
aVEfficiently used, it really can do our work
p596
aVwithout working our undoing.
p597
aa(lp598
VEach of you owns a piece of that $5 trillion prize.
p599
aVAnd our new book "Reinventing Fire"
p600
aVdescribes how you can capture it.
p601
aVSo with the conversation just begun
p602
aVat ReinventingFire.com,
p603
aVlet me invite you each
p604
aVto engage with us and with each other, with everyone around you,
p605
aVto help make the world richer, fairer,
p606
aVcooler and safer
p607
aVby together reinventing fire.
