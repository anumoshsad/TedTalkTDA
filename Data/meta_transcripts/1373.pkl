VI'm going to speak
p4
aVabout a tiny, little idea.
p5
aVAnd this is about shifting baseline.
p6
aVAnd because the idea can be explained in one minute,
p7
aVI will tell you three stories before
p8
aVto fill in the time.
p9
aVAnd the first story
p10
aVis about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
p11
aVAnd he was here, as you well know, in '35.
p12
aVAnd you'd think he was chasing finches,
p13
aVbut he wasn't.
p14
aVHe was actually collecting fish.
p15
aVAnd he described one of them
p16
aVas very "common."
p17
aVThis was the sailfin grouper.
p18
aVA big fishery was run on it
p19
aVuntil the '80s.
p20
aVNow the fish is on the IUCN Red List.
p21
aVNow this story,
p22
aVwe have heard it lots of times
p23
aVon Galapagos and other places,
p24
aVso there is nothing particular about it.
p25
aVBut the point is, we still come to Galapagos.
p26
aVWe still think it is pristine.
p27
aVThe brochures still say
p28
aVit is untouched.
p29
aVSo what happens here?
p30
aa(lp31
VThe second story, also to illustrate another concept,
p32
aVis called shifting waistline.
p33
aV(Laughter)
p34
aVBecause I was there in '71,
p35
aVstudying a lagoon in West Africa.
p36
aVI was there because I grew up in Europe
p37
aVand I wanted later to work in Africa.
p38
aVAnd I thought I could blend in.
p39
aVAnd I got a big sunburn,
p40
aVand I was convinced that I was really not from there.
p41
aVThis was my first sunburn.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd the lagoon
p44
aVwas surrounded by palm trees,
p45
aVas you can see, and a few mangrove.
p46
aVAnd it had tilapia
p47
aVabout 20 centimeters,
p48
aVa species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia.
p49
aVAnd the fisheries for this tilapia
p50
aVsustained lots of fish and they had a good time
p51
aVand they earned more than average
p52
aVin Ghana.
p53
aVWhen I went there 27 years later,
p54
aVthe fish had shrunk to half of their size.
p55
aVThey were maturing at five centimeters.
p56
aVThey had been pushed genetically.
p57
aVThere were still fishes.
p58
aVThey were still kind of happy.
p59
aVAnd the fish also were happy to be there.
p60
aVSo nothing has changed,
p61
aVbut everything has changed.
p62
aa(lp63
VMy third little story
p64
aVis that I was an accomplice
p65
aVin the introduction of trawling
p66
aVin Southeast Asia.
p67
aVIn the '70s \u2014 well, beginning in the '60s \u2014
p68
aVEurope did lots of development projects.
p69
aVFish development
p70
aVmeant imposing on countries
p71
aVthat had already 100,000 fishers
p72
aVto impose on them industrial fishing.
p73
aVAnd this boat, quite ugly,
p74
aVis called the Mutiara 4.
p75
aVAnd I went sailing on it,
p76
aVand we did surveys
p77
aVthroughout the southern South China sea
p78
aVand especially the Java Sea.
p79
aVAnd what we caught,
p80
aVwe didn't have words for it.
p81
aVWhat we caught, I know now,
p82
aVis the bottom of the sea.
p83
aVAnd 90 percent of our catch
p84
aVwere sponges,
p85
aVother animals that are fixed on the bottom.
p86
aVAnd actually most of the fish,
p87
aVthey are a little spot on the debris,
p88
aVthe piles of debris, were coral reef fish.
p89
aVEssentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck
p90
aVand then was thrown down.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd these pictures are extraordinary
p93
aVbecause this transition is very rapid.
p94
aVWithin a year, you do a survey
p95
aVand then commercial fishing begins.
p96
aVThe bottom is transformed
p97
aVfrom, in this case, a hard bottom or soft coral
p98
aVinto a muddy mess.
p99
aVThis is a dead turtle.
p100
aVThey were not eaten, they were thrown away because they were dead.
p101
aVAnd one time we caught a live one.
p102
aVIt was not drowned yet.
p103
aVAnd then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat.
p104
aVThis mountain of debris
p105
aVis actually collected by fishers
p106
aVevery time they go
p107
aVinto an area that's never been fished.
p108
aVBut it's not documented.
p109
aa(lp110
VWe transform the world,
p111
aVbut we don't remember it.
p112
aVWe adjust our baseline
p113
aVto the new level,
p114
aVand we don't recall what was there.
p115
aVIf you generalize this,
p116
aVsomething like this happens.
p117
aVYou have on the y axis some good thing:
p118
aVbiodiversity, numbers of orca,
p119
aVthe greenness of your country, the water supply.
p120
aVAnd over time it changes \u2014
p121
aVit changes
p122
aVbecause people do things, or naturally.
p123
aVEvery generation
p124
aVwill use the images
p125
aVthat they got at the beginning of their conscious lives
p126
aVas a standard
p127
aVand will extrapolate forward.
p128
aVAnd the difference then,
p129
aVthey perceive as a loss.
p130
aVBut they don't perceive what happened before as a loss.
p131
aVYou can have a succession of changes.
p132
aVAt the end you want to sustain
p133
aVmiserable leftovers.
p134
aVAnd that, to a large extent, is what we want to do now.
p135
aVWe want to sustain things that are gone
p136
aVor things that are not the way they were.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow one should think
p139
aVthis problem affected people
p140
aVcertainly when in predatory societies,
p141
aVthey killed animals
p142
aVand they didn't know they had done so
p143
aVafter a few generations.
p144
aVBecause, obviously,
p145
aVan animal that is very abundant,
p146
aVbefore it gets extinct,
p147
aVit becomes rare.
p148
aVSo you don't lose abundant animals.
p149
aVYou always lose rare animals.
p150
aVAnd therefore they're not perceived
p151
aVas a big loss.
p152
aVOver time,
p153
aVwe concentrate on large animals,
p154
aVand in a sea that means the big fish.
p155
aVThey become rarer because we fish them.
p156
aVOver time we have a few fish left
p157
aVand we think this is the baseline.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd the question is,
p160
aVwhy do people accept this?
p161
aVWell because they don't know that it was different.
p162
aVAnd in fact, lots of people, scientists,
p163
aVwill contest that it was really different.
p164
aVAnd they will contest this
p165
aVbecause the evidence
p166
aVpresented in an earlier mode
p167
aVis not in the way
p168
aVthey would like the evidence presented.
p169
aVFor example,
p170
aVthe anecdote that some present,
p171
aVas Captain so-and-so
p172
aVobserved lots of fish in this area
p173
aVcannot be used
p174
aVor is usually not utilized by fishery scientists,
p175
aVbecause it's not "scientific."
p176
aVSo you have a situation
p177
aVwhere people don't know the past,
p178
aVeven though we live in literate societies,
p179
aVbecause they don't trust
p180
aVthe sources of the past.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd hence, the enormous role
p183
aVthat a marine protected area can play.
p184
aVBecause with marine protected areas,
p185
aVwe actually recreate the past.
p186
aVWe recreate the past that people cannot conceive
p187
aVbecause the baseline has shifted
p188
aVand is extremely low.
p189
aVThat is for people
p190
aVwho can see a marine protected area
p191
aVand who can benefit
p192
aVfrom the insight that it provides,
p193
aVwhich enables them to reset their baseline.
p194
aa(lp195
VHow about the people who can't do that
p196
aVbecause they have no access \u2014
p197
aVthe people in the Midwest for example?
p198
aVThere I think
p199
aVthat the arts and film
p200
aVcan perhaps fill the gap,
p201
aVand simulation.
p202
aVThis is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay.
p203
aVThere were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago \u2014
p204
aV500 years ago.
p205
aVAnd you will have noticed that the hues and tones
p206
aVare like "Avatar."
p207
aV(Laughter)
p208
aVAnd if you think about "Avatar,"
p209
aVif you think of why people were so touched by it \u2014
p210
aVnever mind the Pocahontas story \u2014
p211
aVwhy so touched by the imagery?
p212
aVBecause it evokes something
p213
aVthat in a sense has been lost.
p214
aVAnd so my recommendation,
p215
aVit's the only one I will provide,
p216
aVis for Cameron to do "Avatar II" underwater.
p217
