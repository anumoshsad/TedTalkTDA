VPhilosophers, dramatists, theologians
p4
aVhave grappled with this question for centuries:
p5
aVwhat makes people go wrong?
p6
aVInterestingly, I asked this question when I was a little kid.
p7
aVI grew up in the South Bronx, inner-city ghetto in New York,
p8
aVand I was surrounded by evil,
p9
aVas all kids are who grew up in an inner city.
p10
aVAnd I had friends who were really good kids,
p11
aVwho lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde scenario \u2014 Robert Louis Stevenson.
p12
aVThat is, they took drugs, got in trouble, went to jail.
p13
aVSome got killed, and some did it without drug assistance.
p14
aa(lp15
VSo when I read Robert Louis Stevenson, that wasn't fiction.
p16
aVThe only question is, what was in the juice?
p17
aVAnd more importantly, that line between good and evil \u2014
p18
aVwhich privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable,
p19
aVwith them on the good side, the others on the bad side \u2014
p20
aVI knew that line was movable, and it was permeable.
p21
aVGood people could be seduced across that line,
p22
aVand under good and some rare circumstances, bad kids could recover
p23
aVwith help, with reform, with rehabilitation.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo I want to begin with this wonderful illusion
p26
aVby [Dutch] artist M.C. Escher.
p27
aVIf you look at it and focus on the white, what you see is a world full of angels.
p28
aVBut let's look more deeply, and as we do,
p29
aVwhat appears is the demons, the devils in the world.
p30
aVThat tells us several things.
p31
aa(lp32
VOne, the world is, was, will always be filled with good and evil,
p33
aVbecause good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition.
p34
aVIt tells me something else.
p35
aVIf you remember, God's favorite angel was Lucifer.
p36
aVApparently, Lucifer means "the light."
p37
aVIt also means "the morning star," in some scripture.
p38
aVAnd apparently, he disobeyed God,
p39
aVand that's the ultimate disobedience to authority.
p40
aVAnd when he did, Michael, the archangel, was sent to kick him out of heaven
p41
aValong with the other fallen angels.
p42
aVAnd so Lucifer descends into hell, becomes Satan,
p43
aVbecomes the devil, and the force of evil in the universe begins.
p44
aa(lp45
VParadoxically, it was God who created hell as a place to store evil.
p46
aVHe didn't do a good job of keeping it there though.
p47
aVSo, this arc of the cosmic transformation of God's favorite angel into the Devil,
p48
aVfor me, sets the context for understanding human beings
p49
aVwho are transformed from good, ordinary people into perpetrators of evil.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo the Lucifer effect, although it focuses on the negatives \u2014
p52
aVthe negatives that people can become,
p53
aVnot the negatives that people are \u2014
p54
aVleads me to a psychological definition.
p55
aVEvil is the exercise of power.
p56
aVAnd that's the key: it's about power.
p57
aVTo intentionally harm people psychologically,
p58
aVto hurt people physically, to destroy people mortally, or ideas,
p59
aVand to commit crimes against humanity.
p60
aVIf you Google "evil," a word that should surely have withered by now,
p61
aVyou come up with 136 million hits in a third of a second.
p62
aa(lp63
VA few years ago \u2014 I am sure all of you were shocked, as I was,
p64
aVwith the revelation of American soldiers abusing prisoners in a strange place
p65
aVin a controversial war, Abu Ghraib in Iraq.
p66
aVAnd these were men and women
p67
aVwho were putting prisoners through unbelievable humiliation.
p68
aVI was shocked, but I wasn't surprised,
p69
aVbecause I had seen those same visual parallels
p70
aVwhen I was the prison superintendent of the Stanford Prison Study.
p71
aa(lp72
VImmediately the Bush administration military said what?
p73
aVWhat all administrations say when there's a scandal:
p74
aV"Don't blame us. It's not the system.
p75
aVIt's the few bad apples, the few rogue soldiers."
p76
aVMy hypothesis is, American soldiers are good, usually.
p77
aVMaybe it was the barrel that was bad.
p78
aVBut how am I going to deal with that hypothesis?
p79
aa(lp80
VI became an expert witness for one of the guards,
p81
aVSergeant Chip Frederick, and in that position,
p82
aVI had access to the dozen investigative reports.
p83
aVI had access to him.
p84
aVI could study him, have him come to my home, get to know him,
p85
aVdo psychological analysis to see, was he a good apple or bad apple.
p86
aVAnd thirdly, I had access to all of the 1,000 pictures
p87
aVthat these soldiers took.
p88
aVThese pictures are of a violent or sexual nature.
p89
aVAll of them come from the cameras of American soldiers.
p90
aVBecause everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera,
p91
aVthey took pictures of everything, more than 1,000.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd what I've done is I organized them into various categories.
p94
aVBut these are by United States military police, army reservists.
p95
aVThey are not soldiers prepared for this mission at all.
p96
aVAnd it all happened in a single place, Tier 1-A, on the night shift.
p97
aVWhy?
p98
aVTier 1-A was the center for military intelligence.
p99
aVIt was the interrogation hold.
p100
aVThe CIA was there.
p101
aVInterrogators from Titan Corporation, all there,
p102
aVand they're getting no information about the insurgency.
p103
aVSo they're going to put pressure on these soldiers,
p104
aVmilitary police, to cross the line,
p105
aVgive them permission to break the will of the enemy,
p106
aVto prepare them for interrogation, to soften them up,
p107
aVto take the gloves off.
p108
aVThose are the euphemisms, and this is how it was interpreted.
p109
aVLet's go down to that dungeon.

aa(lp131
VSo, pretty horrific.
p132
aVThat's one of the visual illustrations of evil.
p133
aVAnd it should not have escaped you
p134
aVthat the reason I paired the prisoner with his arms out
p135
aVwith Leonardo da Vinci's ode to humanity
p136
aVis that that prisoner was mentally ill.
p137
aVThat prisoner covered himself with shit every day,
p138
aVthey had to roll him in dirt so he wouldn't stink.
p139
aVBut the guards ended up calling him "Shit Boy."
p140
aVWhat was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution?
p141
aa(lp142
VIn any event, here's former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld.
p143
aVHe comes down and says, "I want to know, who is responsible?
p144
aVWho are the bad apples?"
p145
aVWell, that's a bad question.
p146
aVYou have to reframe it and ask, "What is responsible?"
p147
aV"What" could be the who of people,
p148
aVbut it could also be the what of the situation,
p149
aVand obviously that's wrongheaded.
p150
aa(lp151
VHow do psychologists try to understand such transformations of human character,
p152
aVif you believe that they were good soldiers
p153
aVbefore they went down to that dungeon?
p154
aVThere are three ways. The main way is called dispositional.
p155
aVWe look at what's inside of the person, the bad apples.
p156
aa(lp157
VThis is the foundation of all of social science,
p158
aVthe foundation of religion, the foundation of war.
p159
aVSocial psychologists like me come along and say,
p160
aV"Yeah, people are the actors on the stage,
p161
aVbut you'll have to be aware of the situation.
p162
aVWho are the cast of characters? What's the costume?
p163
aVIs there a stage director?"
p164
aVAnd so we're interested in what are the external factors
p165
aVaround the individual \u2014 the bad barrel?
p166
aVSocial scientists stop there and they miss the big point
p167
aVthat I discovered when I became an expert witness for Abu Ghraib.
p168
aVThe power is in the system.
p169
aVThe system creates the situation that corrupts the individuals,
p170
aVand the system is the legal, political, economic, cultural background.
p171
aVAnd this is where the power is of the bad-barrel makers.
p172
aa(lp173
VIf you want to change a person, change the situation.
p174
aVAnd to change it, you've got to know where the power is, in the system.
p175
aVSo the Lucifer effect involves understanding
p176
aVhuman character transformations with these three factors.
p177
aVAnd it's a dynamic interplay.
p178
aVWhat do the people bring into the situation?
p179
aVWhat does the situation bring out of them?
p180
aVAnd what is the system that creates and maintains that situation?
p181
aa(lp182
VMy recent book, "The Lucifer Effect," is about,
p183
aVhow do you understand how good people turn evil?
p184
aVAnd it has a lot of detail about what I'm going to talk about today.
p185
aVSo Dr. Z's "Lucifer Effect," although it focuses on evil,
p186
aVreally is a celebration of the human mind's infinite capacity
p187
aVto make any of us kind or cruel,
p188
aVcaring or indifferent, creative or destructive,
p189
aVand it makes some of us villains.
p190
aVAnd the good news that I'm going to hopefully come to at the end
p191
aVis that it makes some of us heroes.
p192
aVThis wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker summarizes my whole talk:
p193
aV"I'm neither a good cop nor a bad cop, Jerome.
p194
aVLike yourself, I'm a complex amalgam
p195
aVof positive and negative personality traits
p196
aVthat emerge or not, depending on the circumstances."
p197
aa(lp198
V(Laughter)
p199
aa(lp200
VThere's a study some of you think you know about,
p201
aVbut very few people have ever read the story.
p202
aVYou watched the movie.
p203
aVThis is Stanley Milgram, little Jewish kid from the Bronx,
p204
aVand he asked the question, "Could the Holocaust happen here, now?"
p205
aVPeople say, "No, that's Nazi Germany, Hitler, you know, that's 1939."
p206
aVHe said, "Yeah, but suppose Hitler asked you,
p207
aV'Would you electrocute a stranger?' 'No way, I'm a good person.'"
p208
aVHe said, "Why don't we put you in a situation
p209
aVand give you a chance to see what you would do?"
p210
aa(lp211
VAnd so what he did was he tested 1,000 ordinary people.
p212
aV500 New Haven, Connecticut, 500 Bridgeport.
p213
aVAnd the ad said, "Psychologists want to understand memory.
p214
aVWe want to improve people's memory, because it is the key to success."
p215
aVOK?
p216
aV"We're going to give you five bucks \u2014 four dollars for your time.
p217
aVWe don't want college students. We want men between 20 and 50."
p218
aVIn the later studies, they ran women.
p219
aVOrdinary people: barbers, clerks, white-collar people.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo, you go down,
p222
aVone of you will be a learner, one will be a teacher.
p223
aVThe learner's a genial, middle-aged guy.
p224
aVHe gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room.
p225
aVThe learner could be middle-aged, could be as young as 20.
p226
aVAnd one of you is told by the authority, the guy in the lab coat,
p227
aV"Your job as teacher is to give him material to learn.
p228
aVGets it right, reward.
p229
aVGets it wrong, you press a button on the shock box.
p230
aVThe first button is 15 volts. He doesn't even feel it."
p231
aVThat's the key.
p232
aVAll evil starts with 15 volts.
p233
aVAnd then the next step is another 15 volts.
p234
aVThe problem is, at the end of the line, it's 450 volts.
p235
aVAnd as you go along, the guy is screaming,
p236
aV"I've got a heart condition! I'm out of here!"
p237
aa(lp238
VYou're a good person. You complain.
p239
aV"Sir, who will be responsible if something happens to him?"
p240
aVThe experimenter says, "Don't worry, I will be responsible.
p241
aVContinue, teacher."
p242
aVAnd the question is, who would go all the way to 450 volts?
p243
aVYou should notice here, when it gets up to 375,
p244
aVit says, "Danger. Severe Shock."
p245
aVWhen it gets up to here, there's "XXX" \u2014 the pornography of power.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo Milgram asks 40 psychiatrists,
p248
aV"What percent of American citizens would go to the end?"
p249
aVThey said only one percent.
p250
aVBecause that's sadistic behavior, and we know, psychiatry knows,
p251
aVonly one percent of Americans are sadistic.
p252
aVOK.
p253
aVHere's the data. They could not be more wrong.
p254
aVTwo thirds go all the way to 450 volts.
p255
aVThis was just one study.
p256
aVMilgram did more than 16 studies.
p257
aVAnd look at this.
p258
aVIn study 16, where you see somebody like you go all the way,
p259
aV90 percent go all the way.
p260
aVIn study five, if you see people rebel,
p261
aV90 percent rebel.
p262
aVWhat about women? Study 13 \u2014 no different than men.
p263
aVSo Milgram is quantifying evil as the willingness of people
p264
aVto blindly obey authority, to go all the way to 450 volts.
p265
aVAnd it's like a dial on human nature.
p266
aVA dial in a sense that you can make almost everybody totally obedient,
p267
aVdown to the majority, down to none.
p268
aa(lp269
VWhat are the external parallels? For all research is artificial.
p270
aVWhat's the validity in the real world?
p271
aV912 American citizens committed suicide or were murdered
p272
aVby family and friends in Guyana jungle in 1978,
p273
aVbecause they were blindly obedient to this guy, their pastor \u2014
p274
aVnot their priest \u2014 their pastor, Reverend Jim Jones.
p275
aVHe persuaded them to commit mass suicide.
p276
aVAnd so, he's the modern Lucifer effect,
p277
aVa man of God who becomes the Angel of Death.
p278
aVMilgram's study is all about individual authority to control people.
p279
aVMost of the time, we are in institutions,
p280
aVso the Stanford Prison Study is a study of the power of institutions
p281
aVto influence individual behavior.
p282
aVInterestingly, Stanley Milgram and I were in the same high school class
p283
aVin James Monroe in the Bronx, 1954.
p284
aa(lp285
VI did this study with my graduate students,
p286
aVespecially Craig Haney \u2014 and it also began work with an ad.
p287
aVWe had a cheap, little ad,
p288
aVbut we wanted college students for a study of prison life.
p289
aV75 people volunteered, took personality tests.
p290
aVWe did interviews.
p291
aVPicked two dozen: the most normal, the most healthy.
p292
aVRandomly assigned them to be prisoner and guard.
p293
aVSo on day one, we knew we had good apples.
p294
aVI'm going to put them in a bad situation.
p295
aa(lp296
VAnd secondly, we know there's no difference
p297
aVbetween the boys who will be guards and those who will be prisoners.
p298
aVTo the prisoners, we said,
p299
aV"Wait at home. The study will begin Sunday."
p300
aVWe didn't tell them
p301
aVthat the city police were going to come and do realistic arrests.
p302
aa(lp303
V(Video) (Music)

aa(lp305
V[Day 1]
p306
aa(lp307
VStudent: A police car pulls up in front, and a cop comes to the front door,
p308
aVand knocks, and says he's looking for me.
p309
aVSo they, right there, you know, they took me out the door,
p310
aVthey put my hands against the car.
p311
aVIt was a real cop car, it was a real policeman,
p312
aVand there were real neighbors in the street,
p313
aVwho didn't know that this was an experiment.
p314
aVAnd there was cameras all around and neighbors all around.
p315
aVThey put me in the car, then they drove me around Palo Alto.
p316
aVThey took me to the basement of the police station.
p317
aVThen they put me in a cell.
p318
aVI was the first one to be picked up, so they put me in a cell,
p319
aVwhich was just like a room with a door with bars on it.
p320
aVYou could tell it wasn't a real jail.
p321
aVThey locked me in there, in this degrading little outfit.
p322
aVThey were taking this experiment too seriously.
p323
aa(lp324
VHere are the prisoners, who are going to be dehumanized, they'll become numbers.
p325
aVHere are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity.
p326
aVGuards get prisoners to clean the toilet bowls out with their bare hands,
p327
aVto do other humiliating tasks.
p328
aVThey strip them naked. They sexually taunt them.
p329
aVThey begin to do degrading activities, like having them simulate sodomy.
p330
aVYou saw simulating fellatio in soldiers in Abu Ghraib.
p331
aVMy guards did it in five days.
p332
aVThe stress reaction was so extreme
p333
aVthat normal kids we picked because they were healthy
p334
aVhad breakdowns within 36 hours.
p335
aVThe study ended after six days, because it was out of control.
p336
aVFive kids had emotional breakdowns.
p337
aa(lp338
VDoes it make a difference
p339
aVif warriors go to battle changing their appearance or not?
p340
aVIf they're anonymous, how do they treat their victims?
p341
aVIn some cultures, they go to war without changing their appearance.
p342
aVIn others, they paint themselves like "Lord of the Flies."
p343
aVIn some, they wear masks.
p344
aVIn many, soldiers are anonymous in uniform.
p345
aVSo this anthropologist, John Watson, found 23 cultures that had two bits of data.
p346
aVDo they change their appearance? 15.
p347
aVDo they kill, torture, mutilate? 13.
p348
aVIf they don't change their appearance,
p349
aVonly one of eight kills, tortures or mutilates.
p350
aVThe key is in the red zone.
p351
aVIf they change their appearance,
p352
aV12 of 13 \u2014 that's 90 percent \u2014 kill, torture, mutilate.
p353
aVAnd that's the power of anonymity.
p354
aa(lp355
VSo what are the seven social processes
p356
aVthat grease the slippery slope of evil?
p357
aVMindlessly taking the first small step.
p358
aVDehumanization of others. De-individuation of self.
p359
aVDiffusion of personal responsibility.
p360
aVBlind obedience to authority.
p361
aVUncritical conformity to group norms.
p362
aVPassive tolerance of evil through inaction, or indifference.
p363
aa(lp364
VAnd it happens when you're in a new or unfamiliar situation.
p365
aVYour habitual response patterns don't work.
p366
aVYour personality and morality are disengaged.
p367
aV"Nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer;
p368
aVnothing more difficult than understanding him," Dostoyevsky.
p369
aVUnderstanding is not excusing. Psychology is not excuse-ology.
p370
aa(lp371
VSo social and psychological research reveals
p372
aVhow ordinary, good people can be transformed without the drugs.
p373
aVYou don't need it. You just need the social-psychological processes.
p374
aVReal world parallels?
p375
aVCompare this with this.
p376
aVJames Schlesinger \u2014 I'm going to end with this \u2014 says,
p377
aV"Psychologists have attempted to understand how and why
p378
aVindividuals and groups who usually act humanely
p379
aVcan sometimes act otherwise in certain circumstances."
p380
aVThat's the Lucifer effect.
p381
aVAnd he goes on to say, "The landmark Stanford study
p382
aVprovides a cautionary tale for all military operations."
p383
aVIf you give people power without oversight,
p384
aVit's a prescription for abuse.
p385
aVThey knew that, and let that happen.
p386
aa(lp387
VSo another report, an investigative report by General Fay,
p388
aVsays the system is guilty.
p389
aVIn this report, he says it was the environment that created Abu Ghraib,
p390
aVby leadership failures that contributed to the occurrence of such abuse,
p391
aVand because it remained undiscovered
p392
aVby higher authorities for a long period of time.
p393
aVThose abuses went on for three months.
p394
aVWho was watching the store?
p395
aVThe answer is nobody, I think on purpose.
p396
aVHe gave the guards permission to do those things,
p397
aVand they knew nobody was ever going to come down to that dungeon.
p398
aa(lp399
VSo you need a paradigm shift in all of these areas.
p400
aVThe shift is away from the medical model that focuses only on the individual.
p401
aVThe shift is toward a public health model
p402
aVthat recognizes situational and systemic vectors of disease.
p403
aVBullying is a disease. Prejudice is a disease.
p404
aVViolence is a disease.
p405
aVSince the Inquisition, we've been dealing with problems at the individual level.
p406
aVIt doesn't work.
p407
aVAleksandr Solzhenitsyn says, "The line between good and evil
p408
aVcuts through the heart of every human being."
p409
aVThat means that line is not out there.
p410
aVThat's a decision that you have to make, a personal thing.
p411
aa(lp412
VSo I want to end very quickly on a positive note.
p413
aVHeroism as the antidote to evil,
p414
aVby promoting the heroic imagination,
p415
aVespecially in our kids, in our educational system.
p416
aVWe want kids to think, "I'm a hero in waiting,
p417
aVwaiting for the right situation to come along,
p418
aVand I will act heroically.
p419
aVMy whole life, I'm now going to focus away from evil \u2014
p420
aVthat I've been in since I was a kid \u2014 to understanding heroes.
p421
aa(lp422
VBanality of heroism.
p423
aVIt's ordinary people who do heroic deeds.
p424
aVIt's the counterpoint to Hannah Arendt's "Banality of Evil."
p425
aVOur traditional societal heroes are wrong, because they are the exceptions.
p426
aVThey organize their life around this. That's why we know their names.
p427
aVOur kids' heroes are also wrong models for them,
p428
aVbecause they have supernatural talents.
p429
aVWe want our kids to realize most heroes are everyday people,
p430
aVand the heroic act is unusual.
p431
aVThis is Joe Darby.
p432
aVHe was the one that stopped those abuses you saw,
p433
aVbecause when he saw those images,
p434
aVhe turned them over to a senior investigating officer.
p435
aVHe was a low-level private, and that stopped it.
p436
aVWas he a hero? No.
p437
aVThey had to put him in hiding, because people wanted to kill him,
p438
aVand then his mother and his wife.
p439
aVFor three years, they were in hiding.
p440
aa(lp441
VThis is the woman who stopped the Stanford Prison Study.
p442
aVWhen I said it got out of control, I was the prison superintendent.
p443
aVI didn't know it was out of control. I was totally indifferent.
p444
aVShe saw that madhouse and said,
p445
aV"You know what, it's terrible what you're doing to those boys.
p446
aVThey're not prisoners nor guards, they're boys, and you are responsible."
p447
aVAnd I ended the study the next day.
p448
aVThe good news is I married her the next year.
p449
aa(lp450
V(Laughter)
p451
aa(lp452
V(Applause)
p453
aa(lp454
VI just came to my senses, obviously.
p455
aa(lp456
VSo situations have the power to do [three things].
p457
aVBut the point is, this is the same situation
p458
aVthat can inflame the hostile imagination in some of us,
p459
aVthat makes us perpetrators of evil,
p460
aVcan inspire the heroic imagination in others.
p461
aVIt's the same situation and you're on one side or the other.
p462
aVMost people are guilty of the evil of inaction,
p463
aVbecause your mother said, "Don't get involved. Mind your own business."
p464
aVAnd you have to say, "Mama, humanity is my business."
p465
aa(lp466
VSo the psychology of heroism is \u2014 we're going to end in a moment \u2014
p467
aVhow do we encourage children in new hero courses,
p468
aVthat I'm working on with Matt Langdon \u2014 he has a hero workshop \u2014
p469
aVto develop this heroic imagination, this self-labeling,
p470
aV"I am a hero in waiting," and teach them skills.
p471
aVTo be a hero, you have to learn to be a deviant,
p472
aVbecause you're always going against the conformity of the group.
p473
aVHeroes are ordinary people whose social actions are extraordinary. Who act.
p474
aa(lp475
VThe key to heroism is two things.
p476
aVYou have to act when other people are passive.
p477
aVB: You have to act socio-centrically, not egocentrically.
p478
aVAnd I want to end with a known story about Wesley Autrey, New York subway hero.
p479
aVFifty-year-old African-American construction worker standing on a subway.
p480
aVA white guy falls on the tracks.
p481
aVThe subway train is coming. There's 75 people there.
p482
aVYou know what? They freeze.
p483
aVHe's got a reason not to get involved.
p484
aVHe's black, the guy's white, and he's got two kids.
p485
aVInstead, he gives his kids to a stranger,
p486
aVjumps on the tracks, puts the guy between the tracks,
p487
aVlays on him, the subway goes over him.
p488
aVWesley and the guy \u2014 20 and a half inches height.
p489
aVThe train clearance is 21 inches.
p490
aVA half an inch would have taken his head off.
p491
aVAnd he said, "I did what anyone could do," no big deal to jump on the tracks.
p492
aa(lp493
VAnd the moral imperative is "I did what everyone should do."
p494
aVAnd so one day, you will be in a new situation.
p495
aVTake path one, you're going to be a perpetrator of evil.
p496
aVEvil, meaning you're going to be Arthur Andersen.
p497
aVYou're going to cheat, or you're going to allow bullying.
p498
aVPath two, you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction.
p499
aVPath three, you become a hero.
p500
aVThe point is, are we ready to take the path to celebrating ordinary heroes,
p501
aVwaiting for the right situation to come along
p502
aVto put heroic imagination into action?
p503
aVBecause it may only happen once in your life,
p504
aVand when you pass it by, you'll always know,
p505
aVI could have been a hero and I let it pass me by.
p506
aVSo the point is thinking it and then doing it.
p507
aa(lp508
VSo I want to thank you. Thank you.
p509
aVLet's oppose the power of evil systems at home and abroad,
p510
aVand let's focus on the positive.
p511
aVAdvocate for respect of personal dignity, for justice and peace,
p512
aVwhich sadly our administration has not been doing.
p513
aa(lp514
VThanks so much.
