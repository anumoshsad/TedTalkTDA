VI want to talk about social innovation
p4
aVand social entrepreneurship.
p5
aVI happen to have triplets.
p6
aVThey're little. They're five years old.
p7
aVSometimes I tell people I have triplets. They say, "Really? How many?"
p8
aa(lp9
V(Laughter)
p10
aa(lp11
VHere's a picture of the kids \u2014 that's Sage, and Annalisa and Rider.
p12
aVNow, I also happen to be gay.
p13
aVBeing gay and fathering triplets is by far
p14
aVthe most socially innovative, socially entrepreneurial thing
p15
aVI have ever done.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
V(Applause)
p20
aa(lp21
VThe real social innovation I want to talk about involves charity.
p22
aVI want to talk about how the things we've been taught to think
p23
aVabout giving and about charity
p24
aVand about the nonprofit sector,
p25
aVare actually undermining the causes we love,
p26
aVand our profound yearning to change the world.
p27
aa(lp28
VBut before I do that, I want to ask if we even believe
p29
aVthat the nonprofit sector has any serious role to play
p30
aVin changing the world.
p31
aVA lot of people say now that business will lift up the developing economies,
p32
aVand social business will take care of the rest.
p33
aVAnd I do believe that business will move the great mass of humanity forward.
p34
aVBut it always leaves behind that 10 percent or more
p35
aVthat is most disadvantaged or unlucky.
p36
aVAnd social business needs markets,
p37
aVand there are some issues for which you just can't develop
p38
aVthe kind of money measures that you need for a market.
p39
aa(lp40
VI sit on the board of a center for the developmentally disabled,
p41
aVand these people want laughter
p42
aVand compassion and they want love.
p43
aVHow do you monetize that?
p44
aVAnd that's where the nonprofit sector and philanthropy come in.
p45
aVPhilanthropy is the market for love.
p46
aVIt is the market for all those people
p47
aVfor whom there is no other market coming.
p48
aVAnd so if we really want, like Buckminster Fuller said,
p49
aVa world that works for everyone,
p50
aVwith no one and nothing left out,
p51
aVthen the nonprofit sector has to be
p52
aVa serious part of the conversation.
p53
aa(lp54
VBut it doesn't seem to be working.
p55
aVWhy have our breast cancer charities not come close
p56
aVto finding a cure for breast cancer,
p57
aVor our homeless charities not come close
p58
aVto ending homelessness in any major city?
p59
aVWhy has poverty remained stuck
p60
aVat 12 percent of the U.S. population for 40 years?
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd the answer is,
p63
aVthese social problems are massive in scale,
p64
aVour organizations are tiny up against them,
p65
aVand we have a belief system that keeps them tiny.
p66
aVWe have two rulebooks.
p67
aVWe have one for the nonprofit sector,
p68
aVand one for the rest of the economic world.
p69
aVIt's an apartheid, and it discriminates
p70
aVagainst the nonprofit sector in five different areas,
p71
aVthe first being compensation.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo in the for-profit sector, the more value you produce,
p74
aVthe more money you can make.
p75
aVBut we don't like nonprofits to use money
p76
aVto incentivize people to produce more in social service.
p77
aVWe have a visceral reaction to the idea that anyone
p78
aVwould make very much money helping other people.
p79
aVInterestingly, we don't have a visceral reaction
p80
aVto the notion that people would make a lot of money
p81
aVnot helping other people.
p82
aVYou know, you want to make 50 million dollars
p83
aVselling violent video games to kids, go for it.
p84
aVWe'll put you on the cover of Wired magazine.
p85
aVBut you want to make half a million dollars
p86
aVtrying to cure kids of malaria,
p87
aVand you're considered a parasite yourself.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Applause)
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd we think of this as our system of ethics,
p92
aVbut what we don't realize is that this system
p93
aVhas a powerful side effect, which is:
p94
aVIt gives a really stark, mutually exclusive choice
p95
aVbetween doing very well for yourself and your family
p96
aVor doing good for the world,
p97
aVto the brightest minds coming out of our best universities,
p98
aVand sends tens of thousands of people
p99
aVwho could make a huge difference in the nonprofit sector,
p100
aVmarching every year directly into the for-profit sector
p101
aVbecause they're not willing to make that kind of lifelong economic sacrifice.
p102
aVBusinessweek did a survey, looked at the compensation packages
p103
aVfor MBAs 10 years out of business school.
p104
aVAnd the median compensation for a Stanford MBA,
p105
aVwith bonus, at the age of 38, was 400,000 dollars.
p106
aVMeanwhile, for the same year, the average salary
p107
aVfor the CEO of a $5 million-plus medical charity in the U.S.
p108
aVwas 232,000 dollars, and for a hunger charity, 84,000 dollars.
p109
aVNow, there's no way you're going to get a lot of people
p110
aVwith $400,000 talent to make a $316,000 sacrifice every year
p111
aVto become the CEO of a hunger charity.
p112
aa(lp113
VSome people say, "Well, that's just because those MBA types are greedy."
p114
aVNot necessarily. They might be smart.
p115
aVIt's cheaper for that person to donate
p116
aV100,000 dollars every year to the hunger charity;
p117
aVsave 50,000 dollars on their taxes \u2014
p118
aVso still be roughly 270,000 dollars a year ahead of the game \u2014
p119
aVnow be called a philanthropist because they donated
p120
aV100,000 dollars to charity;
p121
aVprobably sit on the board of the hunger charity;
p122
aVindeed, probably supervise the poor SOB
p123
aVwho decided to become the CEO of the hunger charity;
p124
aa(lp125
V(Laughter)
p126
aa(lp127
Vand have a lifetime of this kind of power and influence
p128
aVand popular praise still ahead of them.
p129
aa(lp130
VThe second area of discrimination is advertising and marketing.
p131
aVSo we tell the for-profit sector, "Spend, spend, spend on advertising,
p132
aVuntil the last dollar no longer produces a penny of value."
p133
aVBut we don't like to see our donations spent on advertising in charity.
p134
aVOur attitude is, "Well, look, if you can get the advertising donated,
p135
aVyou know, to air at four o'clock in the morning, I'm okay with that.
p136
aVBut I don't want my donation spent on advertising,
p137
aVI want it go to the needy."
p138
aVAs if the money invested in advertising
p139
aVcould not bring in dramatically greater sums of money
p140
aVto serve the needy.
p141
aa(lp142
VIn the 1990s, my company created
p143
aVthe long-distance AIDSRide bicycle journeys,
p144
aVand the 60 mile-long breast cancer three-day walks,
p145
aVand over the course of nine years,
p146
aVwe had 182,000 ordinary heroes participate,
p147
aVand they raised a total of 581 million dollars.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Applause)
p150
aa(lp151
VThey raised more money more quickly for these causes
p152
aVthan any events in history,
p153
aVall based on the idea that people are weary
p154
aVof being asked to do the least they can possibly do.
p155
aVPeople are yearning to measure the full distance of their potential
p156
aVon behalf of the causes that they care about deeply.
p157
aVBut they have to be asked.
p158
aVWe got that many people to participate
p159
aVby buying full-page ads in The New York Times,
p160
aVin The Boston Globe, in prime time radio and TV advertising.
p161
aVDo you know how many people we would've gotten
p162
aVif we put up fliers in the laundromat?
p163
aa(lp164
VCharitable giving has remained stuck in the U.S., at two percent of GDP,
p165
aVever since we started measuring it in the 1970s.
p166
aVThat's an important fact, because it tells us
p167
aVthat in 40 years, the nonprofit sector
p168
aVhas not been able to wrestle any market share
p169
aVaway from the for-profit sector.
p170
aVAnd if you think about it, how could one sector
p171
aVpossibly take market share away from another sector
p172
aVif it isn't really allowed to market?
p173
aVAnd if we tell the consumer brands,
p174
aV"You may advertise all the benefits of your product,"
p175
aVbut we tell charities, "You cannot advertise all the good that you do,"
p176
aVwhere do we think the consumer dollars are going to flow?
p177
aa(lp178
VThe third area of discrimination is the taking of risk
p179
aVin pursuit of new ideas for generating revenue.
p180
aVSo Disney can make a new $200 million movie that flops,
p181
aVand nobody calls the attorney general.
p182
aVBut you do a little $1 million community fundraiser for the poor,
p183
aVand it doesn't produce a 75 percent profit to the cause in the first 12 months,
p184
aVand your character is called into question.
p185
aVSo nonprofits are really reluctant to attempt any brave,
p186
aVdaring, giant-scale new fundraising endeavors,
p187
aVfor fear that if the thing fails,
p188
aVtheir reputations will be dragged through the mud.
p189
aVWell, you and I know
p190
aVwhen you prohibit failure, you kill innovation.
p191
aVIf you kill innovation in fundraising, you can't raise more revenue;
p192
aVif you can't raise more revenue, you can't grow;
p193
aVand if you can't grow, you can't possibly solve large social problems.
p194
aa(lp195
VThe fourth area is time.
p196
aVSo Amazon went for six years without returning any profit to investors,
p197
aVand people had patience.
p198
aVThey knew that there was a long-term objective down the line,
p199
aVof building market dominance.
p200
aVBut if a nonprofit organization ever had a dream
p201
aVof building magnificent scale that required that for six years,
p202
aVno money was going to go to the needy,
p203
aVit was all going to be invested in building this scale,
p204
aVwe would expect a crucifixion.
p205
aa(lp206
VThe last area is profit itself.
p207
aVSo the for-profit sector can pay people profits
p208
aVin order to attract their capital for their new ideas,
p209
aVbut you can't pay profits in a nonprofit sector,
p210
aVso the for-profit sector has a lock
p211
aVon the multi-trillion-dollar capital markets,
p212
aVand the nonprofit sector is starved for growth and risk and idea capital.
p213
aa(lp214
VWell, you put those five things together \u2014
p215
aVyou can't use money to lure talent away from the for-profit sector;
p216
aVyou can't advertise on anywhere near the scale
p217
aVthe for-profit sector does for new customers;
p218
aVyou can't take the kinds of risks in pursuit of those customers
p219
aVthat the for-profit sector takes;
p220
aVyou don't have the same amount of time to find them as the for-profit sector;
p221
aVand you don't have a stock market with which to fund any of this,
p222
aVeven if you could do it in the first place \u2014
p223
aVand you've just put the nonprofit sector
p224
aVat an extreme disadvantage to the for-profit sector,
p225
aVon every level.
p226
aVIf we have any doubts about the effects of this separate rule book,
p227
aVthis statistic is sobering:
p228
aVFrom 1970 to 2009,
p229
aVthe number of nonprofits that really grew,
p230
aVthat crossed the $50 million annual revenue barrier,
p231
aVis 144.
p232
aVIn the same time, the number of for-profits that crossed it
p233
aVis 46,136.
p234
aVSo we're dealing with social problems that are massive in scale,
p235
aVand our organizations can't generate any scale.
p236
aVAll of the scale goes to Coca-Cola and Burger King.
p237
aa(lp238
VSo why do we think this way?
p239
aVWell, like most fanatical dogma in America,
p240
aVthese ideas come from old Puritan beliefs.
p241
aVThe Puritans came here for religious reasons, or so they said,
p242
aVbut they also came here because they wanted to make a lot of money.
p243
aVThey were pious people,
p244
aVbut they were also really aggressive capitalists,
p245
aVand they were accused of extreme forms of profit-making tendencies,
p246
aVcompared to the other colonists.
p247
aVBut at the same time, the Puritans were Calvinists,
p248
aVso they were taught literally to hate themselves.
p249
aVThey were taught that self-interest was a raging sea
p250
aVthat was a sure path to eternal damnation.
p251
aVThis created a real problem for these people.
p252
aVHere they've come all the way across the Atlantic to make all this money,
p253
aVbut making all this money will get you sent directly to Hell.
p254
aVWhat were they to do about this?
p255
aa(lp256
VWell, charity became their answer.
p257
aVIt became this economic sanctuary,
p258
aVwhere they could do penance for their profit-making tendencies \u2014
p259
aVat five cents on the dollar.
p260
aVSo of course, how could you make money in charity
p261
aVif charity was your penance for making money?
p262
aVFinancial incentive was exiled from the realm of helping others,
p263
aVso that it could thrive in the area of making money for yourself,
p264
aVand in 400 years, nothing has intervened
p265
aVto say, "That's counterproductive and that's unfair."
p266
aa(lp267
VNow, this ideology gets policed by this one very dangerous question,
p268
aVwhich is, "What percentage of my donation goes to the cause versus overhead?"
p269
aVThere are a lot of problems with this question.
p270
aVI'm going to just focus on two.
p271
aVFirst, it makes us think that overhead is a negative,
p272
aVthat it is somehow not part of the cause.
p273
aVBut it absolutely is, especially if it's being used for growth.
p274
aVNow, this idea that overhead is somehow an enemy of the cause
p275
aVcreates this second, much larger problem,
p276
aVwhich is, it forces organizations to go without the overhead things
p277
aVthey really need to grow,
p278
aVin the interest of keeping overhead low.
p279
aa(lp280
VSo we've all been taught that charities should spend
p281
aVas little as possible on overhead things like fundraising
p282
aVunder the theory that, well, the less money you spend on fundraising,
p283
aVthe more money there is available for the cause.
p284
aVWell, that's true if it's a depressing world
p285
aVin which this pie cannot be made any bigger.
p286
aVBut if it's a logical world in which investment in fundraising
p287
aVactually raises more funds and makes the pie bigger,
p288
aVthen we have it precisely backwards,
p289
aVand we should be investing more money, not less, in fundraising,
p290
aVbecause fundraising is the one thing
p291
aVthat has the potential to multiply the amount of money
p292
aVavailable for the cause that we care about so deeply.
p293
aa(lp294
VI'll give you two examples.
p295
aVWe launched the AIDSRides
p296
aVwith an initial investment of 50,000 dollars in risk capital.
p297
aVWithin nine years, we had multiplied that 1,982 times,
p298
aVinto 108 million dollars after all expenses, for AIDS services.
p299
aVWe launched the breast cancer three-days
p300
aVwith an initial investment of 350,000 dollars in risk capital.
p301
aVWithin just five years, we had multiplied that 554 times,
p302
aVinto 194 million dollars after all expenses,
p303
aVfor breast cancer research.
p304
aVNow, if you were a philanthropist really interested in breast cancer,
p305
aVwhat would make more sense:
p306
aVgo out and find the most innovative researcher in the world
p307
aVand give her 350,000 dollars for research,
p308
aVor give her fundraising department the 350,000 dollars
p309
aVto multiply it into 194 million dollars for breast cancer research?
p310
aV2002 was our most successful year ever.
p311
aVWe netted for breast cancer alone, that year alone,
p312
aV71 million dollars after all expenses.
p313
aVAnd then we went out of business,
p314
aVsuddenly and traumatically.
p315
aa(lp316
VWhy? Well, the short story is, our sponsors split on us.
p317
aVThey wanted to distance themselves from us
p318
aVbecause we were being crucified in the media
p319
aVfor investing 40 percent of the gross in recruitment
p320
aVand customer service and the magic of the experience,
p321
aVand there is no accounting terminology to describe
p322
aVthat kind of investment in growth and in the future,
p323
aVother than this demonic label of "overhead."
p324
aVSo on one day, all 350 of our great employees
p325
aVlost their jobs ...
p326
aVbecause they were labeled "overhead."
p327
aVOur sponsor went and tried the events on their own.
p328
aVThe overhead went up.
p329
aVNet income for breast cancer research went down by 84 percent,
p330
aVor 60 million dollars, in one year.
p331
aa(lp332
VThis is what happens when we confuse morality with frugality.
p333
aVWe've all been taught that the bake sale with five percent overhead
p334
aVis morally superior to the professional fundraising enterprise
p335
aVwith 40 percent overhead,
p336
aVbut we're missing the most important piece of information, which is:
p337
aVWhat is the actual size of these pies?
p338
aVWho cares if the bake sale only has five percent overhead if it's tiny?
p339
aVWhat if the bake sale only netted 71 dollars for charity
p340
aVbecause it made no investment in its scale
p341
aVand the professional fundraising enterprise netted
p342
aV71 million dollars because it did?
p343
aVNow which pie would we prefer,
p344
aVand which pie do we think people who are hungry would prefer?
p345
aa(lp346
VHere's how all of this impacts the big picture.
p347
aVI said that charitable giving is two percent of GDP in the United States.
p348
aVThat's about 300 billion dollars a year.
p349
aVBut only about 20 percent of that, or 60 billion dollars,
p350
aVgoes to health and human services causes.
p351
aVThe rest goes to religion and higher education and hospitals,
p352
aVand that 60 billion dollars is not nearly enough
p353
aVto tackle these problems.
p354
aVBut if we could move charitable giving from two percent of GDP,
p355
aVup just one step to three percent of GDP, by investing in that growth,
p356
aVthat would be an extra 150 billion dollars a year in contributions,
p357
aVand if that money could go disproportionately
p358
aVto health and human services charities,
p359
aVbecause those were the ones we encouraged to invest in their growth,
p360
aVthat would represent a tripling of contributions to that sector.
p361
aVNow we're talking scale.
p362
aVNow we're talking the potential for real change.
p363
aVBut it's never going to happen by forcing these organizations
p364
aVto lower their horizons
p365
aVto the demoralizing objective of keeping their overhead low.
p366
aa(lp367
VOur generation does not want its epitaph to read,
p368
aV"We kept charity overhead low."
p369
aa(lp370
V(Laughter)
p371
aa(lp372
V(Applause)
p373
aa(lp374
VWe want it to read that we changed the world,
p375
aVand that part of the way we did that
p376
aVwas by changing the way we think about these things.
p377
aa(lp378
VSo the next time you're looking at a charity,
p379
aVdon't ask about the rate of their overhead.
p380
aVAsk about the scale of their dreams,
p381
aVtheir Apple-, Google-, Amazon-scale dreams,
p382
aVhow they measure their progress toward those dreams,
p383
aVand what resources they need to make them come true,
p384
aVregardless of what the overhead is.
p385
aVWho cares what the overhead is
p386
aVif these problems are actually getting solved?
p387
aa(lp388
VIf we can have that kind of generosity \u2014
p389
aVa generosity of thought \u2014
p390
aVthen the non-profit sector can play a massive role
p391
aVin changing the world for all those citizens
p392
aVmost desperately in need of it to change.
p393
aVAnd if that can be our generation's enduring legacy \u2014
p394
aVthat we took responsibility
p395
aVfor the thinking that had been handed down to us,
p396
aVthat we revisited it, we revised it,
p397
aVand we reinvented the whole way humanity thinks about changing things,
p398
aVforever, for everyone \u2014
p399
aVwell, I thought I would let the kids sum up what that would be.
