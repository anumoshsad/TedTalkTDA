VI would like to talk to you about a story
p4
aVabout a small town kid.
p5
aVI don't know his name, but I do know his story.
p6
aVHe lives in a small village in southern Somalia.
p7
aVHis village is near Mogadishu.
p8
aVDrought drives the small village into poverty
p9
aVand to the brink of starvation.
p10
aVWith nothing left for him there,
p11
aVhe leaves for the big city,
p12
aVin this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.
p13
aVWhen he arrives, there are no opportunities,
p14
aVno jobs, no way forward.
p15
aVHe ends up living in a tent city
p16
aVon the outskirts of Mogadishu.
p17
aVMaybe a year passes, nothing.
p18
aVOne day, he's approached by a gentleman
p19
aVwho offers to take him to lunch,
p20
aVthen to dinner, to breakfast.
p21
aVHe meets this dynamic group of people,
p22
aVand they give him a break.
p23
aVHe's given a bit of money
p24
aVto buy himself some new clothes,
p25
aVmoney to send back home to his family.
p26
aVHe is introduced to this young woman.
p27
aVHe eventually gets married.
p28
aVHe starts this new life.
p29
aVHe has a purpose in life.
p30
aa(lp31
VOne beautiful day in Mogadishu,
p32
aVunder an azure blue sky,
p33
aVa car bomb goes off.
p34
aVThat small town kid with the big city dreams
p35
aVwas the suicide bomber,
p36
aVand that dynamic group of people
p37
aVwere al Shabaab, a terrorist organization
p38
aVlinked to al Qaeda.
p39
aa(lp40
VSo how does the story of a small town kid
p41
aVjust trying to make it big in the city
p42
aVend up with him blowing himself up?
p43
aVHe was waiting.
p44
aVHe was waiting for an opportunity,
p45
aVwaiting to begin his future,
p46
aVwaiting for a way forward,
p47
aVand this was the first thing that came along.
p48
aVThis was the first thing that pulled him out
p49
aVof what we call waithood.
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd his story repeats itself
p52
aVin urban centers around the world.
p53
aVIt is the story of the disenfranchised,
p54
aVunemployed urban youth
p55
aVwho sparks riots in Johannesburg,
p56
aVsparks riots in London,
p57
aVwho reaches out for something other than waithood.
p58
aVFor young people, the promise of the city,
p59
aVthe big city dream is that of opportunity,
p60
aVof jobs, of wealth,
p61
aVbut young people are not sharing in the prosperity of their cities.
p62
aVOften it's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates.
p63
aVBy 2030, three out of five people living in cities
p64
aVwill be under the age of 18.
p65
aVIf we do not include young people
p66
aVin the growth of our cities,
p67
aVif we do not provide them opportunities,
p68
aVthe story of waithood,
p69
aVthe gateway to terrorism, to violence, to gangs,
p70
aVwill be the story of cities 2.0.
p71
aVAnd in my city of birth, Mogadishu,
p72
aV70 percent of young people suffer from unemployment.
p73
aV70 percent don't work,
p74
aVdon't go to school.
p75
aVThey pretty much do nothing.
p76
aa(lp77
VI went back to Mogadishu last month,
p78
aVand I went to visit Madina Hospital,
p79
aVthe hospital I was born in.
p80
aVI remember standing in front of that
p81
aVbullet-ridden hospital thinking,
p82
aVwhat if I had never left?
p83
aVWhat if I had been forced
p84
aVinto that same state of waithood?
p85
aVWould I have become a terrorist?
p86
aVI'm not really sure about the answer.
p87
aa(lp88
VMy reason for being in Mogadishu that month
p89
aVwas actually to host
p90
aVa youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit.
p91
aVI brought together about 90 young Somali leaders.
p92
aVWe sat down and brainstormed on solutions
p93
aVto the biggest challenges facing their city.
p94
aa(lp95
VOne of the young men in the room was Aden.
p96
aVHe went to university in Mogadishu, graduated.
p97
aVThere were no jobs, no opportunities.
p98
aVI remember him telling me,
p99
aVbecause he was a college graduate,
p100
aVunemployed, frustrated,
p101
aVthat he was the perfect target for al Shabaab
p102
aVand other terrorist organizations, to be recruited.
p103
aVThey sought people like him out.
p104
aa(lp105
VBut his story takes a different route.
p106
aVIn Mogadishu, the biggest barrier
p107
aVto getting from point A to point B are the roads.
p108
aVTwenty-three years of civil war
p109
aVhave completely destroyed the road system,
p110
aVand a motorbike can be the easiest way
p111
aVto get around.
p112
aVAden saw an opportunity and seized it.
p113
aVHe started a motorbike company.
p114
aVHe began renting out motorbikes
p115
aVto local residents who couldn't normally afford them.
p116
aVHe bought 10 bikes, with the help
p117
aVof family and friends,
p118
aVand his dream is to eventually expand
p119
aVto several hundred within the next three years.
p120
aa(lp121
VHow is this story different?
p122
aVWhat makes his story different?
p123
aVI believe it is his ability to identify
p124
aVand seize a new opportunity.
p125
aVIt's entrepreneurship,
p126
aVand I believe entrepreneurship can be
p127
aVthe most powerful tool against waithood.
p128
aVIt empowers young people
p129
aVto be the creators of the very economic opportunities
p130
aVthey are so desperately seeking.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
p133
aVI want to talk to you about a young man
p134
aVwho attended one of my meetings,
p135
aVMohamed Mohamoud, a florist.
p136
aVHe was helping me train some of the young people
p137
aVat the summit in entrepreneurship
p138
aVand how to be innovative
p139
aVand how to create a culture of entrepreneurship.
p140
aVHe's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen
p141
aVin over 22 years,
p142
aVand until recently, until Mohamed came along,
p143
aVif you wanted flowers at your wedding,
p144
aVyou used plastic bouquets
p145
aVshipped from abroad.
p146
aVIf you asked someone,
p147
aV"When was the last time you saw fresh flowers?"
p148
aVfor many who grew up under civil war,
p149
aVthe answer would be, "Never."
p150
aa(lp151
VSo Mohamed saw an opportunity.
p152
aVHe started a landscaping and design floral company.
p153
aVHe created a farm right outside of Mogadishu,
p154
aVand started growing tulips and lilies,
p155
aVwhich he said could survive
p156
aVthe harsh Mogadishu climate.
p157
aVAnd he began delivering flowers to weddings,
p158
aVcreating gardens at homes
p159
aVand businesses around the city,
p160
aVand he's now working on creating
p161
aVMogadishu's first public park in 22 years.
p162
aVThere's no public park in Mogadishu.
p163
aVHe wants to create a space where families,
p164
aVyoung people, can come together,
p165
aVand, as he says, smell the proverbial roses.
p166
aVAnd he doesn't grow roses because
p167
aVthey use too much water, by the way.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo the first step is to inspire young people,
p170
aVand in that room, Mohamed's presence
p171
aVhad a really profound impact on the youth in that room.
p172
aVThey had never really thought about starting up a business.
p173
aVThey've thought about working for an NGO,
p174
aVworking for the government,
p175
aVbut his story, his innovation,
p176
aVreally had a strong impact on them.
p177
aVHe forced them to look at their city
p178
aVas a place of opportunity.
p179
aVHe empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs,
p180
aVthat they could be change makers.
p181
aVBy the end of the day, they were coming up
p182
aVwith innovative solutions
p183
aVto some of the biggest challenges facing their city.
p184
aVThey came up with entrepreneurial solutions
p185
aVto local problems.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo inspiring young people
p188
aVand creating a culture of entrepreneurship
p189
aVis a really great step,
p190
aVbut young people need capital
p191
aVto make their ideas a reality.
p192
aVThey need expertise and mentorship
p193
aVto guide them in developing and launching their businesses.
p194
aVConnect young people with the resources they need,
p195
aVprovide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation,
p196
aVand you will create catalysts for urban growth.
p197
aa(lp198
VFor me, entrepreneurship is more than just
p199
aVstarting up a business.
p200
aVIt's about creating a social impact.
p201
aVMohamed is not simply selling flowers.
p202
aVI believe he is selling hope.
p203
aVHis Peace Park, and that's what he calls it,
p204
aVwhen it's created, will actually transform
p205
aVthe way people see their city.
p206
aVAden hired street kids to help rent out
p207
aVand maintain those bikes for him.
p208
aVHe gave them the opportunity to escape
p209
aVthe paralysis of waithood.
p210
aVThese young entrepreneurs are having
p211
aVa tremendous impact in their cities.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo my suggestion is,
p214
aVturn youth into entrepreneurs,
p215
aVincubate and nurture their inherent innovation,
p216
aVand you will have more stories of flowers and Peace Parks
p217
aVthan of car bombs and waithood.
p218
aa(lp219
VThank you.
