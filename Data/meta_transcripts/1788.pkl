V(Nature sounds)
p4
aVWhen I first began recording wild soundscapes
p5
aV45 years ago,
p6
aVI had no idea that ants,
p7
aVinsect larvae, sea anemones and viruses
p8
aVcreated a sound signature.
p9
aVBut they do.
p10
aVAnd so does every wild habitat on the planet,
p11
aVlike the Amazon rainforest you're hearing behind me.
p12
aVIn fact, temperate and tropical rainforests
p13
aVeach produce a vibrant animal orchestra,
p14
aVthat instantaneous and organized expression
p15
aVof insects, reptiles, amphibians, birds and mammals.
p16
aVAnd every soundscape that springs from a wild habitat
p17
aVgenerates its own unique signature,
p18
aVone that contains incredible amounts of information,
p19
aVand it's some of that information I want to share with you today.
p20
aVThe soundscape is made up of three basic sources.
p21
aVThe first is the geophony,
p22
aVor the nonbiological sounds that occur
p23
aVin any given habitat,
p24
aVlike wind in the trees, water in a stream,
p25
aVwaves at the ocean shore, movement of the Earth.
p26
aVThe second of these is the biophony.
p27
aVThe biophony is all of the sound
p28
aVthat's generated by organisms in a given habitat
p29
aVat one time and in one place.
p30
aVAnd the third is all of the sound that we humans generate
p31
aVthat's called anthrophony.
p32
aVSome of it is controlled, like music or theater,
p33
aVbut most of it is chaotic and incoherent,
p34
aVwhich some of us refer to as noise.
p35
aVThere was a time when I considered wild soundscapes
p36
aVto be a worthless artifact.
p37
aVThey were just there, but they had no significance.
p38
aVWell, I was wrong. What I learned from these encounters
p39
aVwas that careful listening gives us incredibly valuable tools
p40
aVby which to evaluate the health of a habitat
p41
aVacross the entire spectrum of life.
p42
aVWhen I began recording in the late '60s,
p43
aVthe typical methods of recording were limited
p44
aVto the fragmented capture of individual species
p45
aVlike birds mostly, in the beginning,
p46
aVbut later animals like mammals and amphibians.
p47
aVTo me, this was a little like trying to understand
p48
aVthe magnificence of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony
p49
aVby abstracting the sound of a single violin player
p50
aVout of the context of the orchestra
p51
aVand hearing just that one part.
p52
aVFortunately, more and more institutions
p53
aVare implementing the more holistic models
p54
aVthat I and a few of my colleagues have introduced
p55
aVto the field of soundscape ecology.
p56
aVWhen I began recording over four decades ago,
p57
aVI could record for 10 hours
p58
aVand capture one hour of usable material,
p59
aVgood enough for an album or a film soundtrack
p60
aVor a museum installation.
p61
aVNow, because of global warming,
p62
aVresource extraction,
p63
aVand human noise, among many other factors,
p64
aVit can take up to 1,000 hours or more
p65
aVto capture the same thing.
p66
aVFully 50 percent of my archive
p67
aVcomes from habitats so radically altered
p68
aVthat they're either altogether silent
p69
aVor can no longer be heard in any of their original form.
p70
aVThe usual methods of evaluating a habitat
p71
aVhave been done by visually counting the numbers of species
p72
aVand the numbers of individuals within each species in a given area.
p73
aVHowever, by comparing data that ties together
p74
aVboth density and diversity from what we hear,
p75
aVI'm able to arrive at much more precise fitness outcomes.
p76
aVAnd I want to show you some examples
p77
aVthat typify the possibilities unlocked
p78
aVby diving into this universe.
p79
aVThis is Lincoln Meadow.
p80
aVLincoln Meadow's a three-and-a-half-hour drive
p81
aVeast of San Francisco in the Sierra Nevada Mountains,
p82
aVat about 2,000 meters altitude,
p83
aVand I've been recording there for many years.
p84
aVIn 1988, a logging company convinced local residents
p85
aVthat there would be absolutely no environmental impact
p86
aVfrom a new method they were trying
p87
aVcalled "selective logging,"
p88
aVtaking out a tree here and there
p89
aVrather than clear-cutting a whole area.
p90
aVWith permission granted to record
p91
aVboth before and after the operation,
p92
aVI set up my gear and captured a large number of dawn choruses
p93
aVto very strict protocol and calibrated recordings,
p94
aVbecause I wanted a really good baseline.
p95
aVThis is an example of a spectrogram.
p96
aVA spectrogram is a graphic illustration of sound
p97
aVwith time from left to right across the page \u2014
p98
aV15 seconds in this case is represented \u2014
p99
aVand frequency from the bottom of the page to the top,
p100
aVlowest to highest.
p101
aVAnd you can see that the signature of a stream
p102
aVis represented here in the bottom third or half of the page,
p103
aVwhile birds that were once in that meadow
p104
aVare represented in the signature across the top.
p105
aVThere were a lot of them.
p106
aVAnd here's Lincoln Meadow before selective logging.
p107
aV(Nature sounds)
p108
aVWell, a year later I returned,
p109
aVand using the same protocols
p110
aVand recording under the same conditions,
p111
aVI recorded a number of examples
p112
aVof the same dawn choruses,
p113
aVand now this is what we've got.
p114
aVThis is after selective logging.
p115
aVYou can see that the stream is still represented
p116
aVin the bottom third of the page,
p117
aVbut notice what's missing in the top two thirds.
p118
aV(Nature sounds)
p119
aVComing up is the sound of a woodpecker.
p120
aVWell, I've returned to Lincoln Meadow 15 times
p121
aVin the last 25 years,
p122
aVand I can tell you that the biophony,
p123
aVthe density and diversity of that biophony,
p124
aVhas not yet returned to anything like it was
p125
aVbefore the operation.
p126
aVBut here's a picture of Lincoln Meadow taken after,
p127
aVand you can see that from the perspective of the camera
p128
aVor the human eye,
p129
aVhardly a stick or a tree appears to be out of place,
p130
aVwhich would confirm the logging company's contention
p131
aVthat there's nothing of environmental impact.
p132
aVHowever, our ears tell us a very different story.
p133
aVYoung students are always asking me
p134
aVwhat these animals are saying,
p135
aVand really I've got no idea.
p136
aVBut I can tell you that they do express themselves.
p137
aVWhether or not we understand it is a different story.
p138
aVI was walking along the shore in Alaska,
p139
aVand I came across this tide pool
p140
aVfilled with a colony of sea anemones,
p141
aVthese wonderful eating machines,
p142
aVrelatives of coral and jellyfish.
p143
aVAnd curious to see if any of them made any noise,
p144
aVI dropped a hydrophone,
p145
aVan underwater microphone covered in rubber,
p146
aVdown the mouth part,
p147
aVand immediately the critter began
p148
aVto absorb the microphone into its belly,
p149
aVand the tentacles were searching out of the surface
p150
aVfor something of nutritional value.
p151
aVThe static-like sounds that are very low,
p152
aVthat you're going to hear right now.
p153
aV(Static sounds)
p154
aVYeah, but watch. When it didn't find anything to eat \u2014
p155
aV(Honking sound)
p156
aV(Laughter)
p157
aVI think that's an expression that can be understood
p158
aVin any language.
p159
aV(Laughter)
p160
aVAt the end of its breeding cycle,
p161
aVthe Great Basin Spadefoot toad
p162
aVdigs itself down about a meter under
p163
aVthe hard-panned desert soil of the American West,
p164
aVwhere it can stay for many seasons
p165
aVuntil conditions are just right for it to emerge again.
p166
aVAnd when there's enough moisture in the soil
p167
aVin the spring, frogs will dig themselves to the surface
p168
aVand gather around these large, vernal pools
p169
aVin great numbers.
p170
aVAnd they vocalize in a chorus
p171
aVthat's absolutely in sync with one another.
p172
aVAnd they do that for two reasons.
p173
aVThe first is competitive, because they're looking for mates,
p174
aVand the second is cooperative,
p175
aVbecause if they're all vocalizing in sync together,
p176
aVit makes it really difficult for predators like coyotes,
p177
aVfoxes and owls to single out any individual for a meal.
p178
aVThis is a spectrogram of what the frog chorusing looks like
p179
aVwhen it's in a very healthy pattern.
p180
aV(Frogs croaking)
p181
aVMono Lake is just to the east of Yosemite National Park
p182
aVin California,
p183
aVand it's a favorite habitat of these toads,
p184
aVand it's also favored by U.S. Navy jet pilots,
p185
aVwho train in their fighters flying them at speeds
p186
aVexceeding 1,100 kilometers an hour
p187
aVand altitudes only a couple hundred meters
p188
aVabove ground level of the Mono Basin,
p189
aVvery fast, very low, and so loud
p190
aVthat the anthrophony, the human noise,
p191
aVeven though it's six and a half kilometers
p192
aVfrom the frog pond you just heard a second ago,
p193
aVit masked the sound of the chorusing toads.
p194
aVYou can see in this spectrogram that all of the energy
p195
aVthat was once in the first spectrogram is gone
p196
aVfrom the top end of the spectrogram,
p197
aVand that there's breaks in the chorusing at two and a half,
p198
aVfour and a half, and six and a half seconds,
p199
aVand then the sound of the jet, the signature,
p200
aVis in yellow at the very bottom of the page.
p201
aV(Frogs croaking)
p202
aVNow at the end of that flyby,
p203
aVit took the frogs fully 45 minutes
p204
aVto regain their chorusing synchronicity,
p205
aVduring which time, and under a full moon,
p206
aVwe watched as two coyotes and a great horned owl
p207
aVcame in to pick off a few of their numbers.
p208
aVThe good news is that, with a little bit of habitat restoration
p209
aVand fewer flights, the frog populations,
p210
aVonce diminishing during the 1980s and early '90s,
p211
aVhave pretty much returned to normal.
p212
aVI want to end with a story told by a beaver.
p213
aVIt's a very sad story,
p214
aVbut it really illustrates how animals
p215
aVcan sometimes show emotion,
p216
aVa very controversial subject among some older biologists.
p217
aVA colleague of mine was recording in the American Midwest
p218
aVaround this pond that had been formed
p219
aVmaybe 16,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age.
p220
aVIt was also formed in part by a beaver dam
p221
aVat one end that held that whole ecosystem together
p222
aVin a very delicate balance.
p223
aVAnd one afternoon, while he was recording,
p224
aVthere suddenly appeared from out of nowhere
p225
aVa couple of game wardens,
p226
aVwho for no apparent reason,
p227
aVwalked over to the beaver dam,
p228
aVdropped a stick of dynamite down it, blowing it up,
p229
aVkilling the female and her young babies.
p230
aVHorrified, my colleagues remained behind
p231
aVto gather his thoughts
p232
aVand to record whatever he could the rest of the afternoon,
p233
aVand that evening, he captured a remarkable event:
p234
aVthe lone surviving male beaver swimming in slow circles
p235
aVcrying out inconsolably for its lost mate and offspring.
p236
aVThis is probably the saddest sound
p237
aVI've ever heard coming from any organism,
p238
aVhuman or other.
p239
aV(Beaver crying)
p240
aVYeah. Well.
p241
aVThere are many facets to soundscapes,
p242
aVamong them the ways in which animals taught us to dance and sing,
p243
aVwhich I'll save for another time.
p244
aVBut you have heard how biophonies
p245
aVhelp clarify our understanding of the natural world.
p246
aVYou've heard the impact of resource extraction,
p247
aVhuman noise and habitat destruction.
p248
aVAnd where environmental sciences have typically
p249
aVtried to understand the world from what we see,
p250
aVa much fuller understanding can be got from what we hear.
p251
aVBiophonies and geophonies are the signature voices
p252
aVof the natural world,
p253
aVand as we hear them,
p254
aVwe're endowed with a sense of place,
p255
aVthe true story of the world we live in.
p256
aVIn a matter of seconds,
p257
aVa soundscape reveals much more information
p258
aVfrom many perspectives,
p259
aVfrom quantifiable data to cultural inspiration.
p260
aVVisual capture implicitly frames
p261
aVa limited frontal perspective of a given spatial context,
p262
aVwhile soundscapes widen that scope
p263
aVto a full 360 degrees, completely enveloping us.
p264
aVAnd while a picture may be worth 1,000 words,
p265
aVa soundscape is worth 1,000 pictures.
p266
aVAnd our ears tell us
p267
aVthat the whisper of every leaf and creature
p268
aVspeaks to the natural sources of our lives,
p269
aVwhich indeed may hold the secrets of love for all things,
p270
aVespecially our own humanity,
p271
aVand the last word goes to a jaguar from the Amazon.
