(lp3
VSo, I'll start with this: a couple years ago, an event planner called me
p4
aVbecause I was going to do a speaking event.
p5
aVAnd she called, and she said,
p6
aV"I'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer."
p7
aVAnd I thought, "Well, what's the struggle?"
p8
aVAnd she said, "Well, I saw you speak,
p9
aVand I'm going to call you a researcher, I think,
p10
aVbut I'm afraid if I call you a researcher, no one will come,
p11
aVbecause they'll think you're boring and irrelevant."
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd I was like, "Okay."
p16
aVAnd she said, "But the thing I liked about your talk
p17
aVis you're a storyteller.
p18
aVSo I think what I'll do is just call you a storyteller."
p19
aVAnd of course, the academic, insecure part of me
p20
aVwas like, "You're going to call me a what?"
p21
aVAnd she said, "I'm going to call you a storyteller."
p22
aVAnd I was like, "Why not 'magic pixie'?"
p23
aa(lp24
V(Laughter)
p25
aa(lp26
VI was like, "Let me think about this for a second."
p27
aVI tried to call deep on my courage.
p28
aVAnd I thought, you know, I am a storyteller.
p29
aVI'm a qualitative researcher.
p30
aVI collect stories; that's what I do.
p31
aVAnd maybe stories are just data with a soul.
p32
aVAnd maybe I'm just a storyteller.
p33
aVAnd so I said, "You know what?
p34
aVWhy don't you just say I'm a researcher-storyteller."
p35
aVAnd she went, "Ha ha. There's no such thing."
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VSo I'm a researcher-storyteller, and I'm going to talk to you today \u2014
p40
aVwe're talking about expanding perception \u2014
p41
aVand so I want to talk to you and tell some stories
p42
aVabout a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception
p43
aVand really actually changed the way that I live and love
p44
aVand work and parent.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd this is where my story starts.
p47
aVWhen I was a young researcher, doctoral student,
p48
aVmy first year, I had a research professor who said to us,
p49
aV"Here's the thing, if you cannot measure it, it does not exist."
p50
aVAnd I thought he was just sweet-talking me.
p51
aVI was like, "Really?" and he was like, "Absolutely."
p52
aVAnd so you have to understand
p53
aVthat I have a bachelor's and a master's in social work,
p54
aVand I was getting my Ph.D. in social work, so my entire academic career
p55
aVwas surrounded by people who kind of believed in the "life's messy, love it."
p56
aVAnd I'm more of the, "life's messy, clean it up, organize it
p57
aVand put it into a bento box."
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd so to think that I had found my way, to found a career that takes me \u2014
p62
aVreally, one of the big sayings in social work is,
p63
aV"Lean into the discomfort of the work."
p64
aVAnd I'm like, knock discomfort upside the head
p65
aVand move it over and get all A's.
p66
aVThat was my mantra.
p67
aVSo I was very excited about this.
p68
aVAnd so I thought, you know what, this is the career for me,
p69
aVbecause I am interested in some messy topics.
p70
aVBut I want to be able to make them not messy.
p71
aVI want to understand them.
p72
aVI want to hack into these things that I know are important
p73
aVand lay the code out for everyone to see.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo where I started was with connection.
p76
aVBecause, by the time you're a social worker for 10 years,
p77
aVwhat you realize is that connection is why we're here.
p78
aVIt's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives.
p79
aVThis is what it's all about.
p80
aVIt doesn't matter whether you talk to people
p81
aVwho work in social justice, mental health and abuse and neglect,
p82
aVwhat we know is that connection, the ability to feel connected, is \u2014
p83
aVneurobiologically that's how we're wired \u2014
p84
aVit's why we're here.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo I thought, you know what, I'm going to start with connection.
p87
aVWell, you know that situation
p88
aVwhere you get an evaluation from your boss,
p89
aVand she tells you 37 things that you do really awesome,
p90
aVand one "opportunity for growth?"
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd all you can think about is that opportunity for growth, right?
p95
aVWell, apparently this is the way my work went as well,
p96
aVbecause, when you ask people about love, they tell you about heartbreak.
p97
aVWhen you ask people about belonging,
p98
aVthey'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded.
p99
aVAnd when you ask people about connection,
p100
aVthe stories they told me were about disconnection.
p101
aa(lp102
VSo very quickly \u2014 really about six weeks into this research \u2014
p103
aVI ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection
p104
aVin a way that I didn't understand or had never seen.
p105
aVAnd so I pulled back out of the research
p106
aVand thought, I need to figure out what this is.
p107
aVAnd it turned out to be shame.
p108
aVAnd shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection:
p109
aVIs there something about me that, if other people know it or see it,
p110
aVthat I won't be worthy of connection?
p111
aa(lp112
VThe things I can tell you about it:
p113
aVIt's universal; we all have it.
p114
aVThe only people who don't experience shame
p115
aVhave no capacity for human empathy or connection.
p116
aVNo one wants to talk about it,
p117
aVand the less you talk about it, the more you have it.
p118
aVWhat underpinned this shame, this "I'm not good enough," \u2014
p119
aVwhich, we all know that feeling:
p120
aV"I'm not blank enough. I'm not thin enough,
p121
aVrich enough, beautiful enough, smart enough, promoted enough."
p122
aVThe thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability.
p123
aVThis idea of, in order for connection to happen,
p124
aVwe have to allow ourselves to be seen, really seen.
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd you know how I feel about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability.
p127
aVAnd so I thought, this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick.
p128
aVI'm going in, I'm going to figure this stuff out,
p129
aVI'm going to spend a year, I'm going to totally deconstruct shame,
p130
aVI'm going to understand how vulnerability works,
p131
aVand I'm going to outsmart it.
p132
aVSo I was ready, and I was really excited.
p133
aVAs you know, it's not going to turn out well.
p134
aa(lp135
V(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
VYou know this.
p138
aVSo, I could tell you a lot about shame,
p139
aVbut I'd have to borrow everyone else's time.
p140
aVBut here's what I can tell you that it boils down to \u2014
p141
aVand this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned
p142
aVin the decade of doing this research.
p143
aa(lp144
VMy one year turned into six years:
p145
aVThousands of stories, hundreds of long interviews, focus groups.
p146
aVAt one point, people were sending me journal pages
p147
aVand sending me their stories \u2014
p148
aVthousands of pieces of data in six years.
p149
aVAnd I kind of got a handle on it.
p150
aVI kind of understood, this is what shame is, this is how it works.
p151
aVI wrote a book, I published a theory, but something was not okay \u2014
p152
aVand what it was is that, if I roughly took the people I interviewed
p153
aVand divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness \u2014
p154
aVthat's what this comes down to, a sense of worthiness \u2014
p155
aVthey have a strong sense of love and belonging \u2014
p156
aVand folks who struggle for it,
p157
aVand folks who are always wondering if they're good enough.
p158
aa(lp159
VThere was only one variable that separated
p160
aVthe people who have a strong sense of love and belonging
p161
aVand the people who really struggle for it.
p162
aVAnd that was, the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging
p163
aVbelieve they're worthy of love and belonging.
p164
aVThat's it.
p165
aVThey believe they're worthy.
p166
aVAnd to me, the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection
p167
aVis our fear that we're not worthy of connection,
p168
aVwas something that, personally and professionally,
p169
aVI felt like I needed to understand better.
p170
aVSo what I did is I took all of the interviews
p171
aVwhere I saw worthiness, where I saw people living that way,
p172
aVand just looked at those.
p173
aa(lp174
VWhat do these people have in common?
p175
aVI have a slight office supply addiction, but that's another talk.
p176
aVSo I had a manila folder, and I had a Sharpie,
p177
aVand I was like, what am I going to call this research?
p178
aVAnd the first words that came to my mind were "whole-hearted."
p179
aVThese are whole-hearted people, living from this deep sense of worthiness.
p180
aVSo I wrote at the top of the manila folder,
p181
aVand I started looking at the data.
p182
aVIn fact, I did it first in a four-day, very intensive data analysis,
p183
aVwhere I went back, pulled the interviews, the stories, pulled the incidents.
p184
aVWhat's the theme? What's the pattern?
p185
aVMy husband left town with the kids
p186
aVbecause I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing,
p187
aVwhere I'm just writing and in my researcher mode.
p188
aa(lp189
VAnd so here's what I found.
p190
aVWhat they had in common was a sense of courage.
p191
aVAnd I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute.
p192
aVCourage, the original definition of courage,
p193
aVwhen it first came into the English language \u2014
p194
aVit's from the Latin word "cor," meaning "heart" \u2014
p195
aVand the original definition was to tell the story of who you are
p196
aVwith your whole heart.
p197
aVAnd so these folks had, very simply, the courage to be imperfect.
p198
aVThey had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others,
p199
aVbecause, as it turns out,
p200
aVwe can't practice compassion with other people
p201
aVif we can't treat ourselves kindly.
p202
aVAnd the last was they had connection, and \u2014 this was the hard part \u2014
p203
aVas a result of authenticity,
p204
aVthey were willing to let go of who they thought they should be
p205
aVin order to be who they were, which you have to absolutely do that
p206
aVfor connection.
p207
aa(lp208
VThe other thing that they had in common was this:
p209
aVThey fully embraced vulnerability.
p210
aVThey believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful.
p211
aVThey didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable,
p212
aVnor did they really talk about it being excruciating \u2014
p213
aVas I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing.
p214
aVThey just talked about it being necessary.
p215
aVThey talked about the willingness to say, "I love you" first ...
p216
aVthe willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ...
p217
aVthe willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call
p218
aVafter your mammogram.
p219
aVThey're willing to invest in a relationship
p220
aVthat may or may not work out.
p221
aVThey thought this was fundamental.
p222
aa(lp223
VI personally thought it was betrayal.
p224
aVI could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research, where our job \u2014
p225
aVyou know, the definition of research is to control and predict,
p226
aVto study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict.
p227
aVAnd now my mission to control and predict
p228
aVhad turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability
p229
aVand to stop controlling and predicting.
p230
aVThis led to a little breakdown \u2014
p231
aa(lp232
V(Laughter)
p233
aa(lp234
V\u2014 which actually looked more like this.
p235
aa(lp236
V(Laughter)
p237
aa(lp238
VAnd it did.
p239
aa(lp240
VI call it a breakdown; my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening.
p241
aa(lp242
V(Laughter)
p243
aa(lp244
VA spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown,
p245
aVbut I assure you, it was a breakdown.
p246
aVAnd I had to put my data away and go find a therapist.
p247
aVLet me tell you something: you know who you are
p248
aVwhen you call your friends and say, "I think I need to see somebody.
p249
aVDo you have any recommendations?"
p250
aVBecause about five of my friends were like,
p251
aV"Wooo, I wouldn't want to be your therapist."
p252
aa(lp253
V(Laughter)
p254
aa(lp255
VI was like, "What does that mean?"
p256
aVAnd they're like, "I'm just saying, you know.
p257
aVDon't bring your measuring stick."
p258
aa(lp259
V(Laughter)
p260
aa(lp261
VI was like, "Okay."
p262
aVSo I found a therapist.
p263
aVMy first meeting with her, Diana \u2014
p264
aVI brought in my list of the way the whole-hearted live, and I sat down.
p265
aVAnd she said, "How are you?"
p266
aVAnd I said, "I'm great. I'm okay."
p267
aVShe said, "What's going on?"
p268
aVAnd this is a therapist who sees therapists,
p269
aVbecause we have to go to those, because their B.S. meters are good.
p270
aa(lp271
V(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd so I said, "Here's the thing, I'm struggling."
p274
aVAnd she said, "What's the struggle?"
p275
aVAnd I said, "Well, I have a vulnerability issue.
p276
aVAnd I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear
p277
aVand our struggle for worthiness,
p278
aVbut it appears that it's also the birthplace of joy, of creativity,
p279
aVof belonging, of love.
p280
aVAnd I think I have a problem, and I need some help."
p281
aVAnd I said, "But here's the thing: no family stuff, no childhood shit."
p282
aa(lp283
V(Laughter)
p284
aa(lp285
V"I just need some strategies."
p286
aa(lp287
V(Laughter)
p288
aa(lp289
V(Applause)
p290
aa(lp291
VThank you.
p292
aVSo she goes like this.
p293
aa(lp294
V(Laughter)
p295
aa(lp296
VAnd then I said, "It's bad, right?"
p297
aVAnd she said, "It's neither good nor bad."
p298
aa(lp299
V(Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
V"It just is what it is."
p302
aVAnd I said, "Oh my God, this is going to suck."
p303
aa(lp304
V(Laughter)
p305
aa(lp306
VAnd it did, and it didn't.
p307
aVAnd it took about a year.
p308
aVAnd you know how there are people
p309
aVthat, when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important,
p310
aVthat they surrender and walk into it.
p311
aVA: that's not me,
p312
aVand B: I don't even hang out with people like that.
p313
aa(lp314
V(Laughter)
p315
aa(lp316
VFor me, it was a yearlong street fight.
p317
aVIt was a slugfest.
p318
aVVulnerability pushed, I pushed back.
p319
aVI lost the fight,
p320
aVbut probably won my life back.
p321
aa(lp322
VAnd so then I went back into the research
p323
aVand spent the next couple of years
p324
aVreally trying to understand what they, the whole-hearted,
p325
aVwhat choices they were making, and what we are doing with vulnerability.
p326
aVWhy do we struggle with it so much?
p327
aVAm I alone in struggling with vulnerability?
p328
aVNo.
p329
aa(lp330
VSo this is what I learned.
p331
aVWe numb vulnerability \u2014
p332
aVwhen we're waiting for the call.
p333
aVIt was funny, I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook
p334
aVthat says, "How would you define vulnerability?
p335
aVWhat makes you feel vulnerable?"
p336
aVAnd within an hour and a half, I had 150 responses.
p337
aVBecause I wanted to know what's out there.
p338
aVHaving to ask my husband for help because I'm sick, and we're newly married;
p339
aVinitiating sex with my husband;
p340
aVinitiating sex with my wife;
p341
aVbeing turned down; asking someone out;
p342
aVwaiting for the doctor to call back;
p343
aVgetting laid off; laying off people.
p344
aVThis is the world we live in.
p345
aVWe live in a vulnerable world.
p346
aVAnd one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability.
p347
aa(lp348
VAnd I think there's evidence \u2014
p349
aVand it's not the only reason this evidence exists,
p350
aVbut I think it's a huge cause \u2014
p351
aVWe are the most in-debt ...
p352
aVobese ...
p353
aVaddicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S. history.
p354
aVThe problem is \u2014 and I learned this from the research \u2014
p355
aVthat you cannot selectively numb emotion.
p356
aVYou can't say, here's the bad stuff.
p357
aVHere's vulnerability, here's grief, here's shame,
p358
aVhere's fear, here's disappointment.
p359
aVI don't want to feel these.
p360
aVI'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin.
p361
aa(lp362
V(Laughter)
p363
aa(lp364
VI don't want to feel these.
p365
aVAnd I know that's knowing laughter.
p366
aVI hack into your lives for a living.
p367
aVGod.
p368
aa(lp369
V(Laughter)
p370
aa(lp371
VYou can't numb those hard feelings
p372
aVwithout numbing the other affects, our emotions.
p373
aVYou cannot selectively numb.
p374
aVSo when we numb those,
p375
aVwe numb joy,
p376
aVwe numb gratitude,
p377
aVwe numb happiness.
p378
aVAnd then, we are miserable,
p379
aVand we are looking for purpose and meaning,
p380
aVand then we feel vulnerable,
p381
aVso then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin.
p382
aVAnd it becomes this dangerous cycle.
p383
aa(lp384
VOne of the things that I think we need to think about
p385
aVis why and how we numb.
p386
aVAnd it doesn't just have to be addiction.
p387
aVThe other thing we do is we make everything that's uncertain certain.
p388
aVReligion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty.
p389
aV"I'm right, you're wrong. Shut up."
p390
aVThat's it.
p391
aVJust certain.
p392
aVThe more afraid we are, the more vulnerable we are,
p393
aVthe more afraid we are.
p394
aVThis is what politics looks like today.
p395
aVThere's no discourse anymore.
p396
aVThere's no conversation.
p397
aVThere's just blame.
p398
aVYou know how blame is described in the research?
p399
aVA way to discharge pain and discomfort.
p400
aVWe perfect.
p401
aVIf there's anyone who wants their life to look like this, it would be me,
p402
aVbut it doesn't work.
p403
aVBecause what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks.
p404
aa(lp405
V(Laughter)
p406
aa(lp407
VWhich just, I hope in 100 years, people will look back and go, "Wow."
p408
aa(lp409
V(Laughter)
p410
aa(lp411
VAnd we perfect, most dangerously, our children.
p412
aVLet me tell you what we think about children.
p413
aVThey're hardwired for struggle when they get here.
p414
aVAnd when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand,
p415
aVour job is not to say, "Look at her, she's perfect.
p416
aVMy job is just to keep her perfect \u2014
p417
aVmake sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh."
p418
aVThat's not our job.
p419
aVOur job is to look and say,
p420
aV"You know what? You're imperfect, and you're wired for struggle,
p421
aVbut you are worthy of love and belonging."
p422
aVThat's our job.
p423
aVShow me a generation of kids raised like that,
p424
aVand we'll end the problems, I think, that we see today.
p425
aVWe pretend that what we do doesn't have an effect on people.
p426
aVWe do that in our personal lives.
p427
aVWe do that corporate \u2014
p428
aVwhether it's a bailout, an oil spill ...
p429
aVa recall.
p430
aVWe pretend like what we're doing
p431
aVdoesn't have a huge impact on other people.
p432
aVI would say to companies, this is not our first rodeo, people.
p433
aVWe just need you to be authentic and real and say ...
p434
aV"We're sorry. We'll fix it."
p435
aa(lp436
VBut there's another way, and I'll leave you with this.
p437
aVThis is what I have found:
p438
aVTo let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, vulnerably seen ...
p439
aVto love with our whole hearts, even though there's no guarantee \u2014
p440
aVand that's really hard,
p441
aVand I can tell you as a parent, that's excruciatingly difficult \u2014
p442
aVto practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror,
p443
aVwhen we're wondering, "Can I love you this much?
p444
aVCan I believe in this this passionately?
p445
