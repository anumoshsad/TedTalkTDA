VSome years ago,
p4
aVI stumbled across a simple design exercise
p5
aVthat helps people understand and solve complex problems,
p6
aVand like many of these design exercises, it kind of seems trivial at first,
p7
aVbut under deep inspection,
p8
aVit turns out that it reveals unexpected truths
p9
aVabout the way that we collaborate and make sense of things.
p10
aa(lp11
VThe exercise has three parts
p12
aVand begins with something that we all know how to do,
p13
aVwhich is how to make toast.
p14
aVIt begins with a clean sheet of paper, a felt marker,
p15
aVand without using any words, you begin to draw how to make toast.
p16
aVAnd most people draw something like this.
p17
aVThey draw a loaf of bread,  which is sliced, then put into a toaster.
p18
aVThe toast is then deposited for some time.
p19
aVIt pops up, and then voila! After two minutes, toast and happiness.
p20
aa(lp21
VNow, over the years, I've collected many hundreds of drawings of these toasts,
p22
aVand some of them are very good,
p23
aVbecause they really illustrate the toast-making process quite clearly.
p24
aVAnd then there are some that are, well, not so good.
p25
aVThey really suck, actually, because you don't know what they're trying to say.
p26
aVUnder close inspection,
p27
aVsome reveal some aspects of toast-making while hiding others.
p28
aVSo there's some that are all about the toast,
p29
aVand all about the transformation of toast.
p30
aVAnd there's others that are all about the toaster,
p31
aVand the engineers love to draw the mechanics of this.
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aVAnd then there are others that are about people.
p34
aVIt's about visualizing the experience that people have.
p35
aVAnd then there are others that are about the supply chain of making toast
p36
aVthat goes all the way back to the store.
p37
aVIt goes through the supply chain networks of teleportation
p38
aVand all the way back to the field and wheat,
p39
aVand one all actually goes all the way back to the Big Bang.
p40
aVSo it's crazy stuff.
p41
aVBut I think it's obvious
p42
aVthat even though these drawings are really wildly different,
p43
aVthey share a common quality, and I'm wondering if you can see it.
p44
aVDo you see it? What's common about these?
p45
aa(lp46
VMost drawings have nodes and links.
p47
aVSo nodes represent the tangible objects like the toaster and people,
p48
aVand links represent the connections between the nodes.
p49
aVAnd it's the combination of links and nodes
p50
aVthat produces a full systems model,
p51
aVand it makes our private mental models visible
p52
aVabout how we think something works.
p53
aVSo that's the value of these things.
p54
aVWhat's interesting about these systems models
p55
aVis how they reveal our various points of view.
p56
aVSo for example, Americans make toast with a toaster.
p57
aVThat seems obvious.
p58
aVWhereas many Europeans make toast with a frying pan, of course,
p59
aVand many students make toast with a fire.
p60
aVI don't really understand this. A lot of MBA students do this.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo you can measure the complexity by counting the number of nodes,
p63
aVand the average illustration has between four and eight nodes.
p64
aVLess than that, the drawing seems trivial,
p65
aVbut it's quick to understand,
p66
aVand more than 13, the drawing produces a feeling of map shock.
p67
aVIt's too complex.
p68
aVSo the sweet spot is between 5 and 13.
p69
aVSo if you want to communicate something visually,
p70
aVhave between five and 13 nodes in your diagram.
p71
aVSo though we may not be skilled at drawing,
p72
aVthe point is that we intuitively know how to break down complex things
p73
aVinto simple things and then  bring them back together again.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo this brings us to our second part of  the exercise,
p76
aVwhich is how to make toast,
p77
aVbut now with sticky notes or with cards.
p78
aVSo what happens then?
p79
aVWell, with cards, most people tend to draw clear, more detailed,
p80
aVand more logical nodes.
p81
aVYou can see the step by step analysis that takes place,
p82
aVand as they build up their model, they move their nodes around,
p83
aVrearranging them like Lego blocks.
p84
aVNow, though this might seem trivial, it's actually really important.
p85
aVThis rapid iteration of expressing and then reflecting and analyzing
p86
aVis really the only way in which we get clarity.
p87
aVIt's the essence of the design process.
p88
aVAnd systems theorists do tell us
p89
aVthat the ease with which we can change a representation
p90
aVcorrelates to our willingness to improve the model.
p91
aVSo sticky note systems are not only more fluid,
p92
aVthey generally produce way more nodes than static drawings.
p93
aVThe drawings are much richer.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd this brings us to our third part of the exercise,
p96
aVwhich is to draw how to make toast, but this time in a group.
p97
aVSo what happens then?
p98
aVWell, here's what happens.
p99
aVIt starts out messy, and then it gets really messy,
p100
aVand then it gets messier,
p101
aVbut as people refine the models,
p102
aVthe best nodes become more prominent,
p103
aVand with each iteration, the model becomes clearer
p104
aVbecause people build on top of each other's ideas.
p105
aVWhat emerges is a unified systems model
p106
aVthat integrates the diversity of everyone's individual points of view,
p107
aVso that's a really different outcome
p108
aVfrom what usually happens  in meetings, isn't it?
p109
aVSo these drawings can contain 20 or more nodes,
p110
aVbut participants don't feel map shock
p111
aVbecause they participate in the building of their models themselves.
p112
aVNow, what's also really interesting, that the groups spontaneously mix
p113
aVand add additional layers of organization to it.
p114
aVTo deal with contradictions, for example,
p115
aVthey add branching patterns and parallel patterns.
p116
aVOh, and by the way, if they do it in complete silence,
p117
aVthey do it much better and much more quickly.
p118
aVReally interesting \u2014 talking gets in the way.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo here's some key lessons that can emerge from this.
p121
aVFirst, drawing helps us understand the situations
p122
aVas systems with nodes and their relationships.
p123
aVMovable cards produce better systems models,
p124
aVbecause we iterate much more fluidly.
p125
aVAnd then the group notes produce  the most comprehensive models
p126
aVbecause we synthesize several points of view.
p127
aVSo that's interesting.
p128
aVWhen people work together under the right circumstances,
p129
aVgroup models are much better than individual models.
p130
aa(lp131
VSo this approach works really great for drawing how to make toast,
p132
aVbut what if you wanted to draw something more relevant or pressing,
p133
aVlike your organizational vision, or customer experience,
p134
aVor long-term sustainability?
p135
aa(lp136
VThere's a visual revolution that's taking place
p137
aVas more organizations are addressing their wicked problems
p138
aVby collaboratively drawing them out.
p139
aVAnd I'm convinced that those who see their world as movable nodes and links
p140
aVreally have an edge.
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd the practice is really pretty simple.
p143
aVYou start with a question, you collect the nodes,
p144
aVyou refine the nodes, you do it over again,
p145
aVyou refine and refine and refine, and the patterns emerge,
p146
aVand the group gets clarity and you answer the question.
p147
aa(lp148
VSo this simple act of visualizing and doing over and over again
p149
aVproduces some really remarkable outcomes.
p150
aVWhat's really important to know
p151
aVis that it's the conversations that are the important aspects,
p152
aVnot just the models themselves.
p153
aVAnd these visual frames of reference
p154
aVcan grow to several hundreds or even thousands of nodes.
p155
aVSo, one example is from an organization called Rodale.
p156
aVBig publishing company.
p157
aVThey lost a bunch of money one year,
p158
aVand their executive team for three days visualized their entire practice.
p159
aVAnd what's interesting is that after visualizing the entire business,
p160
aVsystems upon systems,
p161
aVthey reclaimed  50 million dollars of revenue,
p162
aVand they also moved from a D rating  to an A rating from their customers.
p163
aVWhy? Because there's alignment from the executive team.
p164
aVSo I'm now on a mission to help organizations
p165
aVsolve their wicked problems by using collaborative visualization,
p166
aVand on a site that I've produced called drawtoast.com,
p167
aVI've collected a bunch of best practices.
p168
aVand so you can learn how to run a workshop here,
p169
aVyou can learn more about the visual language
p170
aVand the structure of links and nodes that you can apply to general problem-solving,
p171
aVand download examples of various templates
p172
aVfor unpacking the thorny problems that we all face in our organizations.
p173
aVSo the seemingly trivial design exercise of drawing toast
p174
aVhelps us get clear, engaged and aligned.
p175
aa(lp176
VSo next time you're confronted with an interesting challenge,
p177
aVremember what design has to teach us.
p178
aVMake your ideas visible, tangible, and consequential.
p179
aVIt's simple, it's fun, it's powerful,
p180
aVand I believe it's an idea worth celebrating.
p181
aa(lp182
VThank you.
