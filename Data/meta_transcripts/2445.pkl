VWhen I moved to Harare in 1985,
p4
aVsocial justice was at the core of Zimbabwe's national health policy.
p5
aVThe new government emerged from a long war of independence
p6
aVand immediately proclaimed a socialist agenda:
p7
aVhealth care services, primary education
p8
aVbecame essentially free.
p9
aVA massive expansion of rural health centers
p10
aVplaced roughly 80 percent of the population
p11
aVless than a two-hour walk from these facilities,
p12
aVa truly remarkable accomplishment.
p13
aVIn 1980, the year of independence,
p14
aV25 percent of Zimbabwean children were fully immunized.
p15
aVBy 1990, a mere decade later,
p16
aVthis proportion stood at 80 percent.
p17
aa(lp18
VI felt tremendously privileged to be part of this transformation,
p19
aVa revolution.
p20
aVThe excitement, the camaraderie, was palpable.
p21
aVWorking side by side with brilliant Zimbabweans \u2014
p22
aVscientists, doctors, activists \u2014
p23
aVI felt connected not only to an African independence movement,
p24
aVbut to a global progressive public health movement.
p25
aa(lp26
VBut there were daunting challenges.
p27
aVZimbabwe reported its first AIDS case in 1985, the year I arrived.
p28
aVI had taken care of a few patients with AIDS in the early 1980s,
p29
aVwhen I did my medical training at Harlem Hospital, but \u2014
p30
aVwe had no idea what lay in store for Africa.
p31
aVInfection rate stood at about two percent in my early days there.
p32
aVThese would soar
p33
aVto one out of every four adults
p34
aVby the time I left Harare 17 years later.
p35
aVBy the mid-1990s,
p36
aVI'd told hundreds of people in the prime of life
p37
aVthat they were HIV-positive.
p38
aVI saw colleagues and friends die,
p39
aVmy students, hospital patients, die.
p40
aa(lp41
VIn response, my colleagues and I set up a clinic.
p42
aVWe did condom demonstrations.
p43
aVWe launched school education and workplace interventions.
p44
aVWe did research. We counseled the partners of infected men
p45
aVabout how to protect themselves.
p46
aVWe worked hard, and at the time, I believed that I was doing my best.
p47
aVI was providing excellent treatment,
p48
aVsuch as it was.
p49
aVBut I was not talking about structural change.
p50
aa(lp51
VFormer UN Secretary Kofi Annan has spoken candidly
p52
aVabout his personal failure
p53
aVleading to the Rwandan genocide.
p54
aVIn 1994, he was head of the UN peacekeeping department.
p55
aVAt a 10-year memorial for the genocide,
p56
aVhe reflected, "I believed at the time I was doing my best,
p57
aVbut I realized after the genocide
p58
aVthat there was more I could and should have done
p59
aVto sound the alarm and rally support."
p60
aa(lp61
VThe AIDS epidemic caught the health community unprepared,
p62
aVand today, when the World Health Organization estimates
p63
aVthat 39 million people have lost their lives to this disease,
p64
aVI'm not alone in feeling remorse and regret
p65
aVat not having done more earlier.
p66
aa(lp67
VBut while living in Zimbabwe,
p68
aVI didn't see my role as an advocacy or a political one.
p69
aVI was there for my technical skills,
p70
aVboth my clinical and my research epidemiology skills.
p71
aVAnd in my mind, my job was to take care of patients
p72
aVand to do research to better understand the population patterns of transmission,
p73
aVand I hoped that we'd slow the spread of the virus.
p74
aVI was aware that socially marginalized populations were at disproportionate risk
p75
aVof getting and dying of AIDS.
p76
aVAnd on the sugar plantations,
p77
aVwhich really more closely resembled feudal fiefdoms
p78
aVthan any modern enterprise,
p79
aV60 percent of pregnant women
p80
aVtested HIV-positive.
p81
aa(lp82
VI worked to show how getting infected was not a moral failure
p83
aVbut instead related to a culture of male superiority,
p84
aVto forced migrant labor and to colonialism.
p85
aVWhites were largely unscathed.
p86
aa(lp87
VAs health professionals,
p88
aVour tools were pitifully weak:
p89
aVimploring people to change their individual behaviors,
p90
aVuse condoms, reduce number of partners.
p91
aVInfection rates climbed,
p92
aVand when treatment became available in the West,
p93
aVtreatment that remains our most potent weapon
p94
aVagainst this virus,
p95
aVit was unaffordable to the public sector across Africa.
p96
aVI didn't speak out
p97
aVabout the unequal access to these life-saving drugs
p98
aVor about the underlying economic and political systems
p99
aVthat were driving infection rates
p100
aVin such huge swaths of the population.
p101
aVI rationalized my silence
p102
aVby reminding myself that I was a guest in the country,
p103
aVthat sounding the alarm could even get me kicked out,
p104
aVkeep me from doing good work,
p105
aVtaking care of my patients,
p106
aVdoing much-needed research.
p107
aVSo I didn't speak out
p108
aVabout the government's early stance on AIDS.
p109
aVI didn't voice my concerns loudly enough.
p110
aa(lp111
VMany doctors, health professionals,
p112
aVmay think I did nothing wrong.
p113
aVOur pact with our patients,
p114
aVthe Hippocratic Oath and its variants,
p115
aVis about the sanctity of the patient-doctor relationship.
p116
aVAnd I did everything I could
p117
aVfor each and every patient of mine.
p118
aa(lp119
VBut I knew
p120
aVthat epidemics emerge along the fissures of our society,
p121
aVreflecting not only biology,
p122
aVbut more importantly patterns of marginalization, exclusion,
p123
aVdiscrimination related to race, gender, sexuality, class and more.
p124
aVIt was true of AIDS.
p125
aVIt was true just recently of Ebola.
p126
aVMedical anthropologists such as Paul Farmer,
p127
aVwho worked on AIDS in Haiti,
p128
aVcall this structural violence:
p129
aVstructural because inequities are embedded
p130
aVin the political and economic organization of our social world,
p131
aVoften in ways that are invisible to those with privilege and power;
p132
aVand violence because its impact \u2014
p133
aVpremature deaths, suffering, illness \u2014 is violent.
p134
aVWe do little for our patients
p135
aVif we fail to recognize
p136
aVthese social injustices.
p137
aVSounding the alarm is the first step towards doing public health right,
p138
aVand it's how we may rally support
p139
aVto break through and create real change together.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo these days, I'm not staying quiet.
p142
aVI'm speaking up about a lot of things,
p143
aVeven when it makes listeners uncomfortable,
p144
aVeven when it makes me uncomfortable.
p145
aVAnd a lot of this is about racial disparities
p146
aVand institutionalized racism,
p147
aVthings that we're not supposed to have in this country anymore,
p148
aVcertainly not in the practice of medicine
p149
aVor public health.
p150
aVBut we have them,
p151
aVand we pay for them in lives cut short.
p152
aVThat's why sounding the alarm
p153
aVabout the impact of racism on health in the United States,
p154
aVthe ongoing institutional and interpersonal violence
p155
aVthat people of color face,
p156
aVcompounded by our tragic legacy
p157
aVof 250 years of slavery,
p158
aV90 years of Jim Crow
p159
aVand 60 years of imperfect equality,
p160
aVsounding the alarm about this
p161
aVis central to doing my job right
p162
aVas New York City's Health Commissioner.
p163
aVIn New York City, premature mortality \u2014 that's death before the age of 65 \u2014
p164
aVis 50 percent higher for black men than white ones.
p165
aVA black woman in 2012
p166
aVfaced more than 10 times the risk of dying related to childbirth
p167
aVas a white woman.
p168
aVAnd though we've made enormous strides
p169
aVin reducing infant mortality rates,
p170
aVa black baby still faces
p171
aVnearly three times the risk of death in its first year of life
p172
aVas compared to a white baby.
p173
aa(lp174
VNew York City's not exceptional.
p175
aVThese statistics are paralleled
p176
aVby statistics found across the United States.
p177
aVA recent New York Times analysis
p178
aVreported that there are 1.5 million missing black men across the country.
p179
aVThey noted that more than one
p180
aVout of every six black men
p181
aVwho today should be between the ages of 25 and 54 years
p182
aVhave disappeared from daily life,
p183
aVlost either to prison or premature death.
p184
aVThere is great injustice
p185
aVin the daily and disproportionate violence faced by young black men,
p186
aVthe focus of recent protests under the banner #BlackLivesMatter.
p187
aVBut we have to remember
p188
aVthat enduring and disparate rates
p189
aVand the occurrence and outcome of common medical conditions \u2014
p190
aVheart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV \u2014
p191
aVdiseases that may kill slowly and quietly
p192
aVand take even more black lives prematurely.
p193
aa(lp194
VAs the #BlackLivesMatter movement unfolded,
p195
aVI felt frustrated and angry
p196
aVthat the medical community
p197
aVhas been reluctant to even use the word "racism"
p198
aVin our research and our work.
p199
aVYou've probably felt something every time I've said it.
p200
aVOur medical students held die-ins in their white coats,
p201
aVbut the medical community has largely stood by passively
p202
aVas ongoing discrimination continues to affect
p203
aVthe disease profile and mortality.
p204
aVAnd I worry
p205
aVthat the trend towards personalized and precision medicine,
p206
aVlooking for biological or genetic targets to better tailor treatment,
p207
aVmay inadvertently cause us to lose sight of the big picture,
p208
aVthat it is the daily context,
p209
aVwhere a person lives, grows,
p210
aVworks, loves,
p211
aVthat most importantly determines population health,
p212
aVand for too many of us, poor health.
p213
aa(lp214
VAs health professionals in our daily work,
p215
aVwhether in the clinic or doing research,
p216
aVwe are witness to great injustice:
p217
aVthe homeless person who is unable to follow medical advice
p218
aVbecause he has more pressing priorities;
p219
aVthe transgender youth who is contemplating suicide
p220
aVbecause our society is just so harsh;
p221
aVthe single mother who has been made to feel that she is responsible
p222
aVfor the poor health of her child.
p223
aa(lp224
VOur role as health professionals
p225
aVis not just to treat our patients
p226
aVbut to sound the alarm
p227
aVand advocate for change.
p228
aVRightfully or not,
p229
aVour societal position gives our voices great credibility,
p230
aVand we shouldn't waste that.
p231
aa(lp232
VI regret not speaking up in Zimbabwe,
p233
aVand I've promised myself
p234
aVthat as New York City's Health Commissioner,
p235
aVI will use every opportunity I have
p236
aVto sound the alarm
p237
aVand rally support for health equity.
p238
aVI will speak out against racism,
p239
aVand I hope you will join me,
p240
aVand I will join you when you speak out against sexism
p241
aVor any other form of inequality.
p242
aVIt's time for us to rise up
p243
aVand collectively speak up
p244
aVabout structural inequality.
p245
aVWe don't have to have all the answers
p246
aVto call for change.
p247
aVWe just need courage.
p248
aVThe health of our patients,
p249
aVthe health of us all, depends on it.
