VYou may want to take a closer look.
p4
aVThere's more to this painting than meets the eye.
p5
aVAnd yes, it's an acrylic painting of a man,
p6
aVbut I didn't paint it on canvas.
p7
aVI painted it directly on top of the man.
p8
aa(lp9
VWhat I do in my art is I skip the canvas altogether,
p10
aVand if I want to paint your portrait,
p11
aVI'm painting it on you, physically on you.
p12
aVThat also means you're probably going to end up
p13
aVwith an earful of paint,
p14
aVbecause I need to paint your ear on your ear.
p15
aVEverything in this scene, the person, the clothes,
p16
aVchairs, wall, gets covered in a mask of paint
p17
aVthat mimics what's directly below it,
p18
aVand in this way, I'm able to take a three-dimensional scene
p19
aVand make it look like a two-dimensional painting.
p20
aVI can photograph it from any angle,
p21
aVand it will still look 2D.
p22
aVThere's no Photoshop here.
p23
aVThis is just a photo
p24
aVof one of my three-dimensional paintings.
p25
aa(lp26
VYou might be wondering how I came up with this idea
p27
aVof turning people into paintings.
p28
aVBut originally, this had nothing to do
p29
aVwith either people or paint.
p30
aVIt was about shadows.
p31
aVI was fascinated with the absence of light,
p32
aVand I wanted to find a way that I could give it materiality
p33
aVand pin it down before it changed.
p34
aVI came up with the idea of painting shadows.
p35
aVI loved that I could hide within this shadow
p36
aVmy own painted version,
p37
aVand it would be almost invisible
p38
aVuntil the light changed, and all of a sudden
p39
aVmy shadow would be brought to the light.
p40
aa(lp41
VI wanted to think about what else I could put shadows on,
p42
aVand I thought of my friend Bernie.
p43
aVBut I didn't just want to paint the shadows.
p44
aVI also wanted to paint the highlights
p45
aVand create a mapping on his body in greyscale.
p46
aVI had a very specific vision of what this would look like,
p47
aVand as I was painting him,
p48
aVI made sure to follow that very closely.
p49
aVBut something kept on flickering before my eyes.
p50
aVI wasn't quite sure what I was looking at.
p51
aVAnd then when I took that moment to take a step back,
p52
aVmagic.
p53
aVI had turned my friend into a painting.
p54
aVI couldn't have foreseen that
p55
aVwhen I wanted to paint a shadow,
p56
aVI would pull out this whole other dimension,
p57
aVthat I would collapse it,
p58
aVthat I would take a painting and make it my friend
p59
aVand then bring him back to a painting.
p60
aa(lp61
VI was a little conflicted though,
p62
aVbecause I was so excited about what I'd found,
p63
aVbut I was just about to graduate from college
p64
aVwith a degree in political science,
p65
aVand I'd always had this dream
p66
aVof going to Washington, D.C.,
p67
aVand sitting at a desk
p68
aVand working in government.
p69
aV(Laughter)
p70
aVWhy did this have to get in the way of all that?
p71
aa(lp72
VI made the tough decision
p73
aVof going home after graduation
p74
aVand not going up to Capitol Hill,
p75
aVbut going down to my parents' basement
p76
aVand making it my job to learn how to paint.
p77
aVI had no idea where to begin.
p78
aVThe last time I'd painted,
p79
aVI was 16 years old at summer camp,
p80
aVand I didn't want to teach myself how to paint
p81
aVby copying the old masters
p82
aVor stretching a canvas
p83
aVand practicing over and over again on that surface,
p84
aVbecause that's not what this project was about for me.
p85
aVIt was about space and light.
p86
aa(lp87
VMy early canvases ended up being
p88
aVthings that you wouldn't expect to be used as canvas,
p89
aVlike fried food.
p90
aVIt's nearly impossible
p91
aVto get paint to stick to the grease in an egg.
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aVEven harder was getting paint to stick
p94
aVto the acid in a grapefruit.
p95
aVIt just would erase my brush strokes
p96
aVlike invisible ink.
p97
aVI'd put something down, and instantly it would be gone.
p98
aa(lp99
VAnd if I wanted to paint on people,
p100
aVwell, I was a little bit embarrassed
p101
aVto bring people down into my studio
p102
aVand show them that I spent my days in a basement
p103
aVputting paint on toast.
p104
aVIt just seemed like it made more sense
p105
aVto practice by painting on myself.
p106
aVOne of my favorite models actually ended up being
p107
aVa retired old man
p108
aVwho not only didn't mind sitting still
p109
aVand getting the paint in his ears,
p110
aVbut he also didn't really have much embarrassment
p111
aVabout being taken out into very public places
p112
aVfor exhibition,
p113
aVlike the Metro.
p114
aa(lp115
VI was having so much fun with this process.
p116
aVI was teaching myself how to paint in all these different styles,
p117
aVand I wanted to see what else I could do with it.
p118
aVI came together with a collaborator, Sheila Vand,
p119
aVand we had the idea of creating paintings
p120
aVin a more unusual surface,
p121
aVand that was milk.
p122
aVWe got a pool. We filled it with milk.
p123
aVWe filled it with Sheila. And I began painting.
p124
aVAnd the images were always
p125
aVcompletely unexpected in the end,
p126
aVbecause I could have a very specific image
p127
aVabout how it would turn out,
p128
aVI could paint it to match that,
p129
aVbut the moment that Sheila laid back into the milk,
p130
aVeverything would change.
p131
aVIt was in constant flux,
p132
aVand we had to, rather than fight it, embrace it,
p133
aVsee where the milk would take us
p134
aVand compensate to make it even better.
p135
aVSometimes, when Sheila would lay down in the milk,
p136
aVit would wash all the paint off of her arms,
p137
aVand it might seem a little bit clumsy,
p138
aVbut our solution would be, okay, hide your arms.
p139
aVAnd one time, she got so much milk in her hair
p140
aVthat it just smeared all the paint off of her face.
p141
aVAll right, well, hide your face.
p142
aVAnd we ended up with something far more elegant
p143
aVthan we could have imagined,
p144
aVeven though this is essentially the same solution
p145
aVthat a frustrated kid uses when he can't draw hands,
p146
aVjust hiding them in the pockets.
p147
aa(lp148
VWhen we started out on the milk project,
p149
aVand when I started out,
p150
aVI couldn't have foreseen that I would go
p151
aVfrom pursuing my dream in politics
p152
aVand working at a desk
p153
aVto tripping over a shadow
p154
aVand then turning people into paintings
p155
aVand painting on people in a pool of milk.
p156
aVBut then again, I guess it's also not unforeseeable
p157
aVthat you can find the strange in the familiar,
p158
aVas long as you're willing to look beyond
p159
aVwhat's already been brought to light,
p160
aVthat you can see what's below the surface,
p161
aVhiding in the shadows,
p162
aVand recognize that there can be more there
p163
aVthan meets the eye.
