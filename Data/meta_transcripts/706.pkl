VChris has been so nice.
p4
aVI don't know how you keep it up, Chris, I really don't.
p5
aVSo nice, all week. He's the kind of man you could say to,
p6
aV"Chris, I'm really sorry, I've crashed your car.
p7
aVAnd it gets worse, I crashed it into your house.
p8
aVYour house has caught fire.
p9
aVAnd what's more, your wife has just run off with your best friend."
p10
aa(lp11
VAnd you know that Chris would say, "Thank you."
p12
aV(Laughter)
p13
aV"Thank you for sharing, that's really interesting."
p14
aV(Laughter)
p15
aV"Thank you for taking me to a place that I didn't know existed. Thank you."
p16
aV(Laughter)
p17
aa(lp18
VOne of the \u2014 (Applause) Thank you for inviting us.
p19
aVOne of the things about appearing later on in the TED week is that,
p20
aVgradually, as the days go by,
p21
aVall the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say.
p22
aV(Laughter)
p23
aVNuclear fusion, I had about 10 minutes on that.
p24
aVSpectroscopy, that was another one.
p25
aVParallel universes.
p26
aVAnd so this morning I thought, "Oh well, I'll just do a card trick."
p27
aV(Laughter)
p28
aVThat one's gone as well.
p29
aVAnd today is Emmanuel's day, I think we've agreed that, already, haven't we?
p30
aVEmmanuel? Absolutely. (Applause)
p31
aVI was planning on finishing on a dance ...
p32
aV(Laughter)
p33
aVSo, that's going to look pretty shabby now.
p34
aa(lp35
VSo, what I thought I'd do is \u2014 in honor of Emmanuel \u2014
p36
aVis, what I can do is to launch today the first
p37
aVTED Global auction.
p38
aVIf I could start, this is the Enigma decoding machine.
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVWho will start me with $1,000? Anyone?
p41
aa(lp42
VThank you. Bruno's face, just then,
p43
aVhe said, "No, don't go through this. Don't, please don't.
p44
aVDon't go through this. Don't do it."
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VI'm worried. When I first got the invitation,
p48
aVthey said somewhere in the thing, they said, "15 minutes to change the world,
p49
aVyour moment onstage." 15 minutes to change the world.
p50
aVI don't know about you, it takes me 15 minutes to change a plug.
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aVSo, the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one.
p53
aVWell, of course now we know we don't have to change a plug,
p54
aVnow we've seen that wonderful demonstration
p55
aVof the wireless electric \u2014 fantastic. You know, it inspires us.
p56
aV300 years ago he'd have been burnt at the stake for that.
p57
aV(Laughter)
p58
aVAnd now it's an idea.
p59
aV(Laughter)
p60
aVIt's great. It's fantastic.
p61
aVBut you do meet some fantastic people,
p62
aVpeople who look at the world in a totally different way.
p63
aa(lp64
VYesterday, David Deutsch, another one
p65
aVwho covered most of what I was going to say.
p66
aV(Laughter)
p67
aVBut when you think of the world in that way,
p68
aVit does make going to Starbucks a whole new experience, don't you think?
p69
aVI mean, he must walk in and they will say,
p70
aV"Would you like a macchiato,
p71
aVor a latte, or an Americano,
p72
aVor a cappuccino?"
p73
aVAnd he'll say,
p74
aV"You're offering me things that are infinitely variable."
p75
aV(Laughter)
p76
aV"How can your coffee be true?"
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aVAnd they will say,
p79
aV"Would you mind if I serve the next customer?"
p80
aV(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd Elaine Morgan yesterday, wasn't she wonderful?
p83
aVFantastic. Really good.
p84
aVHer talk about the aquatic ape, and the link, of course,
p85
aVthe link between Darwinism
p86
aVand the fact that we are all naked beneath this \u2014
p87
aVwe're not hirsute and we can swim rather well.
p88
aVAnd she said, you know, she's 90. She's running out of time, she said.
p89
aVAnd she's desperate to find more evidence for the link.
p90
aVAnd I think, "I'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh."
p91
aV(Laughter)
p92
aVThis man has swum around the North Pole, what more evidence do you want?
p93
aV(Laughter)
p94
aVAnd there he is.
p95
aV(Applause)
p96
aVThat's how TED brings these connections together.
p97
aa(lp98
VI wasn't here on Tuesday. I didn't actually see Gordon Brown's
p99
aVjob application \u2014 um, sorry.
p100
aV(Laughter)
p101
aVI'm so sorry. (Applause)
p102
aVI'm so sorry. No, no. (Applause)
p103
aVNo, no, ahh ... (Applause)
p104
aV(As Brown): "Global problems require Scottish solutions."
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aVThe problem I have is because Gordon Brown, he comes onstage
p107
aVand he looks for all the world like a man
p108
aVwho's just taken the head off a bear suit.
p109
aa(lp110
V(As Brown): "Hello, can I tell you what happened in the woods back there?
p111
aVUh, no." (Laughter)
p112
aV"I'm sorry. I've only got 18 minutes, 18 minutes to talk about saving the world,
p113
aVsaving the planet, global institutions.
p114
aVOur work on climate change,
p115
aVI've only got 18 minutes, unfortunately I'm not able to tell you about
p116
aVall the wonderful things we're doing to promote the climate change agenda
p117
aVin Great Britain,
p118
aVlike the third runway we're planning at Heathrow Airport ..."
p119
aV(Laughter)
p120
aV"The large coal-fired power station we're building
p121
aVat King's North,
p122
aVand of course the exciting news that only today,
p123
aVonly this week, Britain's only manufacturer
p124
aVof wind turbines has been forced to close.
p125
aVNo time, unfortunately,
p126
aVto mention those."
p127
aV(Applause)
p128
aV"British jobs for Scottish people ...
p129
aVNo." (Laughter)
p130
aV"Christian principles, Christian values.
p131
aVThou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal,
p132
aVthou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife."
p133
aV(Laughter)
p134
aV"Although to be honest, when I was at Number 11 that was never going to be a problem."
p135
aV(Laughter)
p136
aa(lp137
V(As Tony Blair): "Yeah, alright, come on, eh.
p138
aVAlright Gordon, come on, eh.
p139
aVI just, can I just say a few things about,
p140
aVfirst about Cherie, because she's a wonderful lady,
p141
aVmy wife, with a wonderful smile.
p142
aVThat reminds me, I must post that letter."
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aV"I just think, you know, what people forget,
p145
aVGordon and I, we always got on perfectly well.
p146
aVAlright, it was never exactly 'Brokeback Mountain.'"
p147
aV(Laughter)
p148
aV"You know, I wrote to him, just before I left office. I said,
p149
aV'Can I rely on your support for the next month?'
p150
aVAnd he wrote back. He said, 'No, you can't.'
p151
aVWhich kind of surprised me, because I'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before."
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VAnother thing Gordon could have mentioned in his speech
p155
aVto the Mansion House in 2002 \u2014
p156
aVthat was to the building; the people weren't listening.
p157
aVBut the people, when talking about the finance industry, he said,
p158
aV"What you as the city of London have done for financial services,
p159
aVwe, as a government, hope to do for the economy as a whole."
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aVWhen you think what's happened to financial services,
p162
aVand you see what's happened to the economy, you think,
p163
aV"Well, there is a man who delivers on his promises."
p164
aV(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VBut we're in a new world now. We're in a completely new world.
p167
aVThis is the first time that I can remember, where if you get a letter
p168
aVfrom the bank manager about a loan, you don't know if you're borrowing
p169
aVmoney from him, or if he's borrowing money from you.
p170
aVAm I right?
p171
aa(lp172
VThese extraordinary things, Icelandic Internet accounts.
p173
aVDid anyone here have an Icelandic Internet account?
p174
aVWhy would you do that? Why would \u2014 It's like one step up
p175
aVfrom replying to one of those emails from Nigeria, isn't it?
p176
aV(Laughter)
p177
aVAsking for your bank details.
p178
aVAnd, you know, Iceland, it was never going to cut it.
p179
aVIt didn't have that kind of collateral.
p180
aVWhat does it have? It has fish, that's all.
p181
aVThat's why the Prime Minister went on television. He said,
p182
aV"This has left us all
p183
aVwith a very big haddock."
p184
aV(Laughter)
p185
aa(lp186
VA lot of what I do \u2014 I have to try and make sense
p187
aVof things before I can make nonsense of them.
p188
aVAnd making sense of the financial crisis is very, very difficult.
p189
aVLuckily, somebody like George Bush was really helpful.
p190
aVHe summed it up, really, at a dinner.
p191
aVHe was speaking at a dinner, he said,
p192
aV"Wall Street got drunk."
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aV"And now it's got a hangover."
p195
aVAnd that's, you know, that's something \u2014
p196
aV(Applause)
p197
aVAnd that's something we can relate to.
p198
aVIt's certainly something he can relate to.
p199
aV(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd the other one, of course, is Donald Rumsfeld, who said,
p202
aV"There are the known knowns, the things we know we know.
p203
aVAnd then you got the known unknowns,
p204
aVthe things we know we don't know.
p205
aVAnd then you got the unknown unknowns, those are the things
p206
aVwe don't know we don't know."
p207
aVAnd being English, when I first heard that I thought, "What a load of cock."
p208
aVAnd then, you're now, well, actually, that's what this is about.
p209
aa(lp210
VThis whole, what Ben Bernanke has said,
p211
aVthe chaotic unwinding of the world's financial system,
p212
aVit's about \u2014 they don't know, they didn't know what they were doing.
p213
aVIn 2006, the head of the American Mortgage Bankers Association said, quote,
p214
aV"As we can clearly see,
p215
aVno seismic occurrence
p216
aVis about to overwhelm the U.S. economy."
p217
aVNow, there is a man on top of his job.
p218
aV(Laughter)
p219
aVAnd when the crisis was happening, the head of quantitative equities
p220
aVat Lehman Brothers said,
p221
aV"Events which models predicted would happen
p222
aVonce every 10,000 years
p223
aVhappened every day for three days."
p224
aa(lp225
VSo, it's extraordinary. It's a new world that's very, very difficult to make sense of.
p226
aVBut we have a new hope. We have a new man.
p227
aVAmerica has now elected its first openly black President.
p228
aV(Laughter)
p229
aVWonderful news.
p230
aVNot only that, he's left-handed. Have you noticed this?
p231
aVHow many people here are left-handed?
p232
aVYou see, a lot of the people that I most admire,
p233
aVthey're great artists, great designers, great thinkers,
p234
aVthey're left-handed.
p235
aVAnd somebody said to me last night, you know, being left-handed,
p236
aVyou have to learn to write without smudging the ink.
p237
aVAnd somebody was talking about metaphors on Monday.
p238
aVAnd I thought, what a wonderful metaphor, isn't it? An American President who
p239
aVhas to write without smudging the ink.
p240
aa(lp241
VYou like that one? As opposed to you could see
p242
aVGeorge Bush, well, what's the metaphor there?
p243
aVI think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing, wouldn't it?
p244
aV"Well, you know I'm sorry about that.
p245
aVI'm right-handed but I seem to have smudged that ink as well."
p246
aV(Laughter)
p247
aVBut, you know, he's gone. Now he's gone.
p248
aVThat's eight years of American History, eight minutes of my act,
p249
aVjust gone like that.
p250
aa(lp251
V"You know, it's the end of an error [sic].
p252
aVI happen to believe it was a great error.
p253
aVI know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors
p254
aVin the history of the United States.
p255
aVBut we proved them wrong in Iraq.
p256
aVThey said there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda.
p257
aVThere is now."
p258
aV(Laughter)
p259
aV"But I have a message for the suicide bombers,
p260
aVfor those people who've blown themselves up."
p261
aV(Laughter)
p262
aV"We're going to find you."
p263
aV(Laughter)
p264
aV"We're going to make sure you don't do it again."
p265
aV(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
VBut now he's gone, and it's great to see one of the \u2014
p268
aVarguably one of the worst speech makers
p269
aVin American history,
p270
aVnow given way to one of the greatest, in Obama.
p271
aVYou were there, maybe, on the night of his victory.
p272
aVAnd he spoke to the crowd in Chicago, he said,
p273
aV"If there is anyone out there
p274
aVwho still doubts
p275
aVthat America is a place
p276
aVwhere all things are possible ..."
p277
aVI can't do the whole thing because it would take too long, it really would.
p278
aV(Laughter)
p279
aVBut you get the picture. And then it goes to the inauguration.
p280
aVAnd he and the Chief Justice, they trip over each other,
p281
aVthey get their words wrong and they screw the thing up.
p282
aVAnd there is George Bush sitting there going, "Heh heh heh heh ..."
p283
aV(Laughter)
p284
aV"Not so easy is it? Heh heh heh."
p285
aV(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
VBut the interesting thing is, Gordon Brown was talking about Cicero,
p288
aVwho said, people would listen to a speech, they said, "Great speech."
p289
aVAnd then they'd listen to Demosthenes,
p290
aVand they'd say, "Let's march."
p291
aVAnd we all want to believe in President Obama.
p292
aVIt's rather like that line in the film "As Good As it Gets."
p293
aVDo you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson,
p294
aVand Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson, "What do you see in me?"
p295
aVAnd Jack Nicholson just says,
p296
aV"You make me want to be a better man."
p297
aa(lp298
VAnd you want a leader who inspires and challenges
p299
aVand makes you want to be a better citizen. Right?
p300
aVBut at the moment, it's a Cicero thing.
p301
aVWe like what Barack Obama says, but we don't do anything about it.
p302
aVSo he comes over to this country, and he says,
p303
aV"We need
p304
aVa big fiscal stimulus."
p305
aVAnd everyone goes, "Great!" He leaves the country
p306
aVand the French and the Germans go, "No, no, forget about that,
p307
aVabsolutely not." Nothing happens. He goes to Strasburg.
p308
aVHe says, "We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan."
p309
aVAnd everyone goes, "Great idea."
p310
aVHe leaves, people go, "No no no, we're not going to do that.
p311
aV5,000 maximum, and no rockets. No, no, not going to do it."
p312
aVHe goes to Prague, he says, "We believe in a nuclear-free world."
p313
aa(lp314
VAnd it's great to have an American president who can say the word "nuclear,"
p315
aVlet's just point that out first.
p316
aVDo you remember that? George Bush, "A nu-ca-ler."
p317
aVSorry, what? "A nu-ca-ler."
p318
aV(Laughter)
p319
aVCould you say "avuncular"? "Avunclear."
p320
aV(Laughter)
p321
aVThank you very much.
p322
aa(lp323
VBut he says, "We want a nuclear-free world."
p324
aVAnd that day, North Korea, that very day,
p325
aVNorth Korea is just seeing if it can
p326
aVjust get one over Japan \u2014
p327
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p328
aVand land it before ...
p329
aa(lp330
VSo, where do we look for inspiration? We've still got Bill Clinton.
p331
aV"Travels the world." (Laughs)
p332
aV"I believe, I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said ..."
p333
aV(Laughter)
p334
aV"Tell a lie; it was Diana Ross ..."
p335
aV(Laughter)
p336
aV"... who said, reach out and touch ..."
p337
aV(Laughter)
p338
aV"... somebody's gla \u2014 hand."
p339
aV(Laughter)
p340
aV"Make this world a better place, if you can.
p341
aVI just think that's important. I really do.
p342
aVAnd I was hoping Hillary would get to the White House,
p343
aVbecause she'd have been out of our home for four years.
p344
aVAnd I, you know." (Laughter)
p345
aV"So, when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements, let me tell you."
p346
aV(Laughter)
p347
aa(lp348
VSo, there's him. In Britain we have Prince Charles:
p349
aV"And the environment is so important, all we can do.
p350
aVMy wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to
p351
aVpush emissions up her agenda."
p352
aV(Laughter)
p353
aa(lp354
VOr, any South Africans, we have Mandela to inspire.
p355
aVMandela, the great man Mandela.
p356
aVHe's been honored with a statue now.
p357
aVThe previous highest honor he had in Britain
p358
aVwas a visit from the team from Ground Force, a gardening program.
p359
aV"So, Nelson, how would you like a nice water feature?"
p360
aV"Ahh, listen to me Mr. Titchmarsh."
p361
aV(Laughter)
p362
aV"I was held in prison
p363
aVfor nearly 30 years
p364
aVon an island
p365
aVin the middle of the ocean.
p366
aVWhy would I need a bloody water feature?"
p367
aV(Laughter)
p368
aa(lp369
VVery quickly: I wasn't quite sure how to end this talk
p370
aVand then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote
p371
aVfrom the "Japanese Essays on Idleness"
p372
aVwhich said it's nice to have something which is unfinished
p373
aVbecause it implies there is still room for growth.
p374
aVThank you very much indeed.
