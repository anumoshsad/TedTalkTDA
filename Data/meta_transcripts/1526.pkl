(lp3
VI thought if I skipped it might help my nerves,
p4
aVbut I'm actually having a paradoxical reaction to that,
p5
aVso that was a bad idea. (Laughter)
p6
aa(lp7
VAnyway, I was really delighted to receive the invitation
p8
aVto present to you some of my music and some of my work
p9
aVas a composer, presumably because it appeals
p10
aVto my well-known and abundant narcissism. (Laughter)
p11
aVAnd I'm not kidding, I just think we should just
p12
aVsay that and move forward. (Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
VSo, but the thing is, a dilemma quickly arose,
p15
aVand that is that I'm really bored with music,
p16
aVand I'm really bored with the role of the composer,
p17
aVand so I decided to put that idea, boredom,
p18
aVas the focus of my presentation to you today.
p19
aVAnd I'm going to share my music with you, but I hope
p20
aVthat I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story,
p21
aVtells a story about how I used boredom as a catalyst
p22
aVfor creativity and invention, and how boredom
p23
aVactually forced me to change the fundamental question
p24
aVthat I was asking in my discipline,
p25
aVand how boredom also, in a sense,
p26
aVpushed me towards taking on roles beyond the sort of
p27
aVmost traditional, narrow definition of a composer.
p28
aa(lp29
VWhat I'd like to do today is to start with an excerpt
p30
aVof a piece of music at the piano.
p31
aV(Music)
p32
aVOkay, I wrote that. (Laughter)
p33
aVNo, it's not \u2014 (Applause) Oh, why thank you.
p34
aVNo, no, I didn't write that.
p35
aVIn fact, that was a piece by Beethoven,
p36
aVand so I was not functioning as a composer.
p37
aVJust now I was functioning in the role of the interpreter,
p38
aVand there I am, interpreter.
p39
aVSo, an interpreter of what? Of a piece of music, right?
p40
aVBut we can ask the question, "But is it music?"
p41
aVAnd I say this rhetorically, because of course
p42
aVby just about any standard we would have to concede
p43
aVthat this is, of course, a piece of music,
p44
aVbut I put this here now because,
p45
aVjust to set it in your brains for the moment,
p46
aVbecause we're going to return to this question.
p47
aVIt's going to be a kind of a refrain
p48
aVas we go through the presentation.
p49
aa(lp50
VSo here we have this piece of music by Beethoven,
p51
aVand my problem with it is, it's boring.
p52
aVI mean, you \u2014 I'm just like, a hush, huh \u2014 It's like \u2014 (Laughter)
p53
aVIt's Beethoven, how can you say that?
p54
aVNo, well, I don't know, it's very familiar to me.
p55
aVI had to practice it as a kid, and I'm really sick of it. So \u2014 (Laughter)
p56
aVI would, so what I might like to try to do is to change it,
p57
aVto transform it in some ways, to personalize it,
p58
aVso I might take the opening, like this idea \u2014
p59
aV(Music)
p60
aVand then I might substitute \u2014 (Music)
p61
aVand then I might improvise on that melody
p62
aVthat goes forward from there \u2014 (Music)
p63
aV(Music)
p64
aa(lp65
VSo that might be the kind of thing \u2014 Why thank you.
p66
aV(Applause)
p67
aVThat would be the kind of thing that I would do,
p68
aVand it's not necessarily better than the Beethoven.
p69
aVIn fact, I think it's not better than it. The thing is \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p70
aVit's more interesting to me. It's less boring for me.
p71
aVI'm really leaning into me, because I, because I have
p72
aVto think about what decisions I'm going to make on the fly
p73
aVas that Beethoven text is running in time through my head
p74
aVand I'm trying to figure out what kinds of transformations
p75
aVI'm going to make to it.
p76
aVSo this is an engaging enterprise for me, and
p77
aVI've really leaned into that first person pronoun thing there,
p78
aVand now my face appears twice, so I think we can agree
p79
aVthat this is a fundamentally solipsistic enterprise. (Laughter)
p80
aVBut it's an engaging one, and it's interesting to me
p81
aVfor a while, but then I get bored with it, and by it,
p82
aVI actually mean, the piano, because it becomes,
p83
aVit's this familiar instrument, it's timbral range is actually
p84
aVpretty compressed, at least when you play on the keyboard,
p85
aVand if you're not doing things like listening to it
p86
aVafter you've lit it on fire or something like that, you know.
p87
aVIt gets a little bit boring, and so pretty soon
p88
aVI go through other instruments, they become familiar,
p89
aVand eventually I find myself designing and constructing
p90
aVmy own instrument, and I brought one with me today,
p91
aVand I thought I would play a little bit on it for you
p92
aVso you can hear what it sounds like.
p93
aa(lp94
V(Music)
p95
aa(lp96
VYou gotta have doorstops, that's important. (Laughter)
p97
aVI've got combs. They're the only combs that I own. (Music)
p98
aVThey're all mounted on my instruments. (Laughter)
p99
aa(lp100
V(Music)
p101
aa(lp102
VI can actually do all sorts of things. I can play
p103
aVwith a violin bow. I don't have to use the chopsticks.
p104
aVSo we have this sound. (Music)
p105
aVAnd with a bank of live electronics,
p106
aVI can change the sounds radically. (Music)
p107
aV(Music)
p108
aVLike that, and like this. (Music)
p109
aVAnd so forth.
p110
aa(lp111
VSo this gives you a little bit of an idea of the sound world
p112
aVof this instrument, which I think is quite interesting
p113
aVand it puts me in the role of the inventor, and the nice thing about \u2014
p114
aVThis instrument is called the Mouseketeer ... (Laughter)
p115
aVand the cool thing about it is
p116
aVI'm the world's greatest Mouseketeer player. (Laughter)
p117
aVOkay? (Applause)
p118
aVSo in that regard, this is one of the things,
p119
aVthis is one of the privileges of being,
p120
aVand here's another role, the inventor, and by the way,
p121
aVwhen I told you that I'm the world's greatest,
p122
aVif you're keeping score, we've had narcissism and solipsism
p123
aVand now a healthy dose of egocentricism.
p124
aVI know some of you are just, you know, bingo! Or, I don't know. (Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
VAnyway, so this is also a really enjoyable role.
p127
aVI should concede also that I'm the world's worst Mouseketeer player,
p128
aVand it was this distinction that I was most worried about
p129
aVwhen I was on that prior side of the tenure divide.
p130
aVI'm glad I'm past that. We're not going to go into that.
p131
aVI'm crying on the inside. There are still scars.
p132
aa(lp133
VAnyway, but I guess my point is that all of these enterprises
p134
aVare engaging to me in their multiplicity, but as I've presented them
p135
aVto you today, they're actually solitary enterprises,
p136
aVand so pretty soon I want to commune with other people, and so
p137
aVI'm delighted that in fact I get to compose works for them.
p138
aVI get to write, sometimes for soloists and I get to work with one person,
p139
aVsometimes full orchestras, and I work with a lot of people,
p140
aVand this is probably the capacity, the role creatively
p141
aVfor which I'm probably best known professionally.
p142
aVNow, some of my scores as a composer look like this,
p143
aVand others look like this,
p144
aVand some look like this,
p145
aVand I make all of these by hand, and it's really tedious.
p146
aVIt takes a long, long time to make these scores,
p147
aVand right now I'm working on a piece
p148
aVthat's 180 pages in length,
p149
aVand it's just a big chunk of my life, and I'm just pulling out hair.
p150
aVI have a lot of it, and that's a good thing I suppose. (Laughter)
p151
aa(lp152
VSo this gets really boring and really tiresome for me,
p153
aVso after a while the process of notating is not only boring,
p154
aVbut I actually want the notation to be more interesting,
p155
aVand so that's pushed me to do other projects like this one.
p156
aa(lp157
VThis is an excerpt from a score called
p158
aV"The Metaphysics of Notation."
p159
aVThe full score is 72 feet wide.
p160
aVIt's a bunch of crazy pictographic notation.
p161
aVLet's zoom in on one section of it right here. You can see
p162
aVit's rather detailed. I do all of this with drafting templates,
p163
aVwith straight edges, with French curves, and by freehand,
p164
aVand the 72 feet was actually split
p165
aVinto 12 six-foot-wide panels that were installed
p166
aVaround the Cantor Arts Center Museum lobby balcony,
p167
aVand it appeared for one year in the museum,
p168
aVand during that year, it was experienced as visual art
p169
aVmost of the week, except, as you can see in these pictures,
p170
aVon Fridays, from noon til one, and only during that time,
p171
aVvarious performers came and interpreted these strange
p172
aVand undefined pictographic glyphs. (Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VNow this was a really exciting experience for me.
p175
aVIt was gratifying musically, but I think
p176
aVthe more important thing is it was exciting because I got to take on
p177
aVanother role, especially given that it appeared in a museum,
p178
aVand that is as visual artist. (Laughter)
p179
aVWe're going to fill up the whole thing, don't worry. (Laughter)
p180
aVI am multitudes. (Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VSo one of the things is that, I mean, some people
p183
aVwould say, like, "Oh, you're being a dilettante,"
p184
aVand maybe that's true. I can understand how, I mean,
p185
aVbecause I don't have a pedigree in visual art
p186
aVand I don't have any training, but it's just something
p187
aVthat I wanted to do as an extension of my composition,
p188
aVas an extension of a kind of creative impulse.
p189
aa(lp190
VI can understand the question, though. "But is it music?"
p191
aVI mean, there's not any traditional notation.
p192
aVI can also understand that sort of implicit criticism
p193
aVin this piece, "S-tog," which I made when I was living in Copenhagen.
p194
aVI took the Copenhagen subway map and
p195
aVI renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations,
p196
aVand the players, who are synchronized with stopwatches,
p197
aVfollow the timetables, which are listed in minutes past the hour.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo this is a case of actually adapting something,
p200
aVor maybe stealing something,
p201
aVand then turning it into a musical notation.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnother adaptation would be this piece.
p204
aVI took the idea of the wristwatch, and I turned it into a musical score.
p205
aVI made my own faces, and had a company fabricate them,
p206
aVand the players follow these scores.
p207
aVThey follow the second hands, and as they pass over
p208
aVthe various symbols, the players respond musically.
p209
aVHere's another example from another piece,
p210
aVand then its realization.
p211
aa(lp212
VSo in these two capacities, I've been scavenger,
p213
aVin the sense of taking, like, the subway map, right,
p214
aVor thief maybe, and I've also been designer,
p215
aVin the case of making the wristwatches.
p216
aVAnd once again, this is, for me, interesting.
p217
aa(lp218
VAnother role that I like to take on is that of the performance artist.
p219
aVSome of my pieces have these kind of weird theatric elements,
p220
aVand I often perform them. I want to show you a clip
p221
aVfrom a piece called "Echolalia."
p222
aVThis is actually being performed by Brian McWhorter,
p223
aVwho is an extraordinary performer.
p224
aVLet's watch a little bit of this, and please notice the instrumentation.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Music)
p227
aa(lp228
VOkay, I hear you were laughing nervously because
p229
aVyou too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp,
p230
aVthe intonation was a little questionable. (Laughter)
p231
aVLet's watch just another clip.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Music)
p234
aa(lp235
VYou can see the mayhem continues, and there's, you know,
p236
aVthere were no clarinets and trumpets
p237
aVand flutes and violins. Here's a piece that has
p238
aVan even more unusual, more peculiar instrumentation.
p239
aa(lp240
VThis is "Tlön," for three conductors and no players. (Laughter)
p241
aa(lp242
VThis was based on the experience of actually watching
p243
aVtwo people having a virulent argument in sign language,
p244
aVwhich produced no decibels to speak of,
p245
aVbut affectively, psychologically, was a very loud experience.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo, yeah, I get it, with, like, the weird appliances
p248
aVand then the total absence of conventional instruments
p249
aVand this glut of conductors, people might, you know,
p250
aVwonder, yeah, "Is this music?"
p251
aa(lp252
VBut let's move on to a piece where clearly I'm behaving myself,
p253
aVand that is my "Concerto for Orchestra."
p254
aVYou're going to notice a lot of conventional instruments
p255
aVin this clip. (Music)
p256
aV(Music)
p257
aa(lp258
VThis, in fact, is not the title of this piece.
p259
aVI was a bit mischievous. In fact, to make it more interesting,
p260
aVI put a space right in here, and this is the actual title of the piece.
p261
aVLet's continue with that same excerpt.
p262
aV(Music)
p263
aa(lp264
VIt's better with a florist, right? (Laughter) (Music)
p265
aVOr at least it's less boring. Let's watch a couple more clips.
p266
aV(Music)
p267
aa(lp268
VSo with all these theatric elements, this pushes me in another role,
p269
aVand that would be, possibly, the dramaturge.
p270
aVI was playing nice. I had to write the orchestra bits, right?
p271
aVOkay? But then there was this other stuff, right?
p272
aVThere was the florist, and I can understand that,
p273
aVonce again, we're putting pressure on the ontology of music
p274
aVas we know it conventionally,
p275
aVbut let's look at one last piece today I'm going to share with you.
p276
aa(lp277
VThis is going to be a piece called "Aphasia,"
p278
aVand it's for hand gestures synchronized to sound,
p279
aVand this invites yet another role, and final one
p280
aVI'll share with you, which is that of the choreographer.
p281
aVAnd the score for the piece looks like this,
p282
aVand it instructs me, the performer, to make
p283
aVvarious hand gestures at very specific times
p284
aVsynchronized with an audio tape, and that audio tape
p285
aVis made up exclusively of vocal samples.
p286
aVI recorded an awesome singer,
p287
aVand I took the sound of his voice in my computer,
p288
aVand I warped it in countless ways to come up with
p289
aVthe soundtrack that you're about to hear.
p290
aVAnd I'll perform just an excerpt of "Aphasia" for you here. Okay?
p291
aV(Music)
p292
aVSo that gives you a little taste of that piece. (Applause)
p293
aa(lp294
VYeah, okay, that's kind of weird stuff.
p295
aVIs it music? Here's how I want to conclude.
p296
aVI've decided, ultimately, that this is the wrong question,
p297
aVthat this is not the important question.
p298
aVThe important question is, "Is it interesting?"
p299
aVAnd I follow this question, not worrying about "Is it music?" \u2014
p300
aVnot worrying about the definition of the thing that I'm making.
p301
aVI allow my creativity to push me
p302
aVin directions that are simply interesting to me,
p303
aVand I don't worry about the likeness of the result
p304
aVto some notion, some paradigm,
p305
aVof what music composition is supposed to be,
p306
aVand that has actually urged me, in a sense,
p307
aVto take on a whole bunch of different roles,
p308
aVand so what I want you to think about is,
p309
aVto what extent might you change the fundamental question
p310
aVin your discipline, and, okay,
p311
aVI'm going to put one extra little footnote in here,
p312
aVbecause, like, I realized I mentioned
p313
aVsome psychological defects earlier, and we also,
p314
aValong the way, had a fair amount of obsessive behavior,
p315
aVand there was some delusional behavior and things like that,
p316
aVand here I think we could say that this is an argument
p317
aVfor self-loathing and a kind of schizophrenia,
p318
aVat least in the popular use of the term,
p319
aVand I really mean dissociative identity disorder, okay. (Laughter)
p320
aVAnyway, despite those perils, I would urge you
p321
aVto think about the possibility that you might take on roles
p322
aVin your own work, whether they are neighboring
p323
aVor far-flung from your professional definition.
p324
aa(lp325
VAnd with that, I thank you very much. (Applause)
