VI was raised by lesbians in the mountains,
p4
aVand I sort of came like a forest gnome to New York City a while back.
p5
aV(Laughter)
p6
aVReally messed with my head, but I'll get into that later.
p7
aa(lp8
VI'll start with when I was eight years old.
p9
aVI took a wood box,
p10
aVand I buried a dollar bill, a pen and a fork inside this box in Colorado.
p11
aVAnd I thought some strange humanoids or aliens in 500 years would find this box
p12
aVand learn about the way our species exchanged ideas,
p13
aVmaybe how we ate our spaghetti.
p14
aVI really didn't know.
p15
aVAnyway, this is kind of funny,
p16
aVbecause here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
p17
aa(lp18
VNow, at some point I was in Hawaii \u2014
p19
aVI like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff,
p20
aVand I was making a collage for my ma.
p21
aVAnd I took a dictionary and I ripped it up,
p22
aVand I made it into a sort of Agnes Martin grid,
p23
aVand I poured resin all over it and a bee got stuck.
p24
aVNow, she's afraid of bees and she's allergic to them,
p25
aVso I poured more resin on the canvas, thinking I could hide it or something.
p26
aVInstead, the opposite happened:
p27
aVIt sort of created a magnification,
p28
aVlike a magnifying glass, on the dictionary text.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo what did I do? I built more boxes.
p31
aVThis time, I started putting electronics, frogs,
p32
aVstrange bottles I'd find in the street \u2014 anything I could find \u2014
p33
aVbecause I was always finding things my whole life,
p34
aVand trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects.
p35
aVSo I started drawing around the objects,
p36
aVand I realized: Holy moly, I can draw in space!
p37
aVI can make free-floating lines,
p38
aVlike the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scene.
p39
aVSo I took the objects out,
p40
aVand I created my own taxonomy of invented specimens.
p41
aVFirst, botanical \u2014 which you can kind of get a sense of.
p42
aVThen I made some weird insects and creatures.
p43
aVIt was really fun; I was just drawing on the layers of resin.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd it was cool, because I was actually starting to have shows and stuff,
p46
aVI was making some money, I could take my girlfriend for dinner,
p47
aVand like, go to Sizzler.
p48
aVIt was some good shit, man.
p49
aV(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VAt some point, I got up to the human form,
p52
aVlife-size resin sculptures with drawings of humans inside the layers.
p53
aVThis was great, except for one thing:
p54
aVI was going to die.
p55
aVI didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
p56
aVAnd I went to bed every night thinking about it.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo I tried using glass.
p59
aVI started drawing on the layers of glass,
p60
aValmost like if you drew on a window, then you put another window,
p61
aVand another window, and you had all these windows together
p62
aVthat made a three-dimensional composition.
p63
aVAnd this really worked, because I could stop using the resin.
p64
aa(lp65
VSo I did this for years,
p66
aVwhich culminated in a very large work, which I call "The Triptych."
p67
aV"The Triptych" was largely inspired
p68
aVby Hieronymus Bosch's "[The] Garden of Earthly Delights,"
p69
aVwhich is a painting in the [Museo del] Prado in Spain.
p70
aVDo you guys know this painting?
p71
aVGood, it's a cool painting.
p72
aVIt's kind of ahead of its time, they say.
p73
aVSo, "The Triptych." I'll walk you through this piece.
p74
aVIt weighs 24,000 pounds.
p75
aVIt's 18 feet long.
p76
aVIt's double-sided, so it's 36 feet of composition.
p77
aVIt's kind of weird.
p78
aVWell, that's the blood fountain.
p79
aV(Laughter)
p80
aVTo the left, you have Jesus and the locusts.
p81
aVThere's a cave
p82
aVwhere all these animal-headed creatures travel between two worlds.
p83
aVThey go from the representational world,
p84
aVto this analog-mesh underworld, where they're hiding.
p85
aVThis is where the animal-headed creatures are by the lighthouse,
p86
aVand they're all about to commit mass suicide into the ocean.
p87
aVThe ocean is made up of thousands of elements.
p88
aVThis is a bird god tied up to a battleship.
p89
aV(Laughter)
p90
aVBilly Graham is in the ocean;
p91
aVthe Horizon from the oil spill; Waldo; Osama Bin Laden's shelter \u2014
p92
aVthere's all kinds of weird stuff that you can find
p93
aVif you look really hard, in the ocean.
p94
aVAnyway, this is a lady creature.
p95
aVShe's coming out of the ocean, and she's spitting oil into one hand
p96
aVand she has clouds coming out of her other hand.
p97
aVHer hands are like scales,
p98
aVand she has the mythological reference of the Earth and cosmos in balance.
p99
aa(lp100
VSo that's one side of "The Triptych."
p101
aVIt's a little narrative thing.
p102
aVThat's her hand that she's spitting into.
p103
aVAnd then, when you go to the other side,
p104
aVshe has like a trunk, like a bird's beak,
p105
aVand she's spitting clouds out of her trunk.
p106
aVThen she has an 18-foot-long serpent's tail that connects "The Triptych."
p107
aVAnyway, her tail catches on fire from the back of the volcano.
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aVI don't know why that happened.
p110
aa(lp111
V(Laughter)
p112
aa(lp113
VThat happens, you know.
p114
aVHer tail terminates in a cycloptic eyeball,
p115
aVmade out of 1986 terrorist cards.
p116
aVHave you guys seen those?
p117
aVThey were made in the 1980's, they're like baseball cards of terrorists.
p118
aVWay ahead of their time.
p119
aa(lp120
V(Laughter)
p121
aa(lp122
VThat will bring you to my latest project.
p123
aVI'm in the middle of two projects:
p124
aVOne's called "Psychogeographies."
p125
aVIt's about a six-year project to make 100 of these humans.
p126
aVEach one is an archive of our culture,
p127
aVthrough our ripped-up media and matter,
p128
aVwhether it's encyclopedias or dictionaries or magazines.
p129
aVBut each one acts as a sort of an archive in the shape of a human,
p130
aVand they travel in groups of 20, 4, or 12 at a time.
p131
aVThey're like cells \u2014 they come together, they divide.
p132
aVAnd you kind of walk through them. It's taking me years.
p133
aVEach one is basically a 3,000-pound microscope slide
p134
aVwith a human stuck inside.
p135
aa(lp136
VThis one has a little cave in his chest.
p137
aVThat's his head; there's the chest, you can kind of see the beginning.
p138
aVI'm going to go down the body for you:
p139
aVThere's a waterfall coming out of his chest,
p140
aVcovering his penis \u2014 or not-penis, or whatever it is,
p141
aVa kind of androgynous thing.
p142
aVI'll take you quickly through these works,
p143
aVbecause I can't explain them for too long.
p144
aVThere are the layers, you can kind of see it.
p145
aVThat's a body getting split in half.
p146
aVThis one has two heads,
p147
aVand it's communicating between the two heads.
p148
aVYou can see the pills coming out,
p149
aVgoing into one head from this weird statue.
p150
aVThere's a little forest scene inside the chest cavity.
p151
aVCan you see that?
p152
aa(lp153
VAnyway, this talk's all about these boxes,
p154
aVlike the boxes we're in.
p155
aVThis box we're in, the solar system is a box.
p156
aVThis brings you to my latest box.
p157
aVIt's a brick box. It's called Pioneer Works.
p158
aa(lp159
V(Cheers)
p160
aa(lp161
VInside of this box is a physicist,
p162
aVa neuroscientist, a painter, a musician,
p163
aVa writer, a radio station, a museum, a school,
p164
aVa publishing arm to disseminate all the content we make there into the world;
p165
aVa garden.
p166
aVWe shake this box up,
p167
aVand all these people kind of start hitting each other like particles.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd I think that's the way you change the world.
p170
aVYou redefine your insides and the box that you're living in.
p171
aVAnd you come together to realize that we're all in this together,
p172
aVthat this delusion of difference \u2014
p173
aVthis idea of countries, of borders, of religion \u2014 doesn't work.
p174
aVWe're all really made up of the same stuff, in the same box.
p175
aVAnd if we don't start exchanging that stuff sweetly and nicely,
p176
aVwe're all going to die real soon.
p177
aa(lp178
VThank you very much.
