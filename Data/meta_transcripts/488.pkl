VAbout four years ago, the New Yorker published an article
p4
aVabout a cache of dodo bones that was found
p5
aVin a pit on the island of Mauritius.
p6
aVNow, the island of Mauritius is a small island
p7
aVoff the east coast of Madagascar
p8
aVin the Indian Ocean, and it is the place
p9
aVwhere the dodo bird was discovered
p10
aVand extinguished, all within about 150 years.
p11
aVEveryone was very excited about this archaeological find,
p12
aVbecause it meant that they might finally be able
p13
aVto assemble a single dodo skeleton.
p14
aa(lp15
VSee, while museums all over the world
p16
aVhave dodo skeletons in their collection, nobody \u2014
p17
aVnot even the actual Natural History Museum
p18
aVon the island of Mauritius \u2014 has a skeleton that's made
p19
aVfrom the bones of a single dodo.
p20
aVWell, this isn't exactly true.
p21
aVThe fact is, is that the British Museum
p22
aVhad a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection
p23
aVup until the 18th century \u2014
p24
aVit was actually mummified, skin and all \u2014
p25
aVbut in a fit of space-saving zeal,
p26
aVthey actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet
p27
aVand they burned the rest in a bonfire.
p28
aVIf you go look at their website today,
p29
aVthey'll actually list these specimens, saying,
p30
aVthe rest was lost in a fire.
p31
aa(lp32
VNot quite the whole truth. Anyway.
p33
aVThe frontispiece of this article was this photo,
p34
aVand I'm one of the people that thinks that Tina Brown
p35
aVwas great for bringing photos to the New Yorker,
p36
aVbecause this photo completely rocked my world.
p37
aVI became obsessed with the object \u2014
p38
aVnot just the beautiful photograph itself,
p39
aVand the color, the shallow depth of field, the detail that's visible,
p40
aVthe wire you can see on the beak there
p41
aVthat the conservator used to put this skeleton together \u2014
p42
aVthere's an entire story here.
p43
aVAnd I thought to myself,
p44
aVwouldn't it be great
p45
aVif I had my own dodo skeleton?
p46
aV(Laughter)
p47
aa(lp48
VI want to point out here at this point that
p49
aVI've spent my life obsessed
p50
aVby objects and the stories that they tell,
p51
aVand this was the very latest one.
p52
aVSo I began looking around for \u2014
p53
aVto see if anyone sold a kit,
p54
aVsome kind of model that I could get,
p55
aVand I found lots of reference material, lots of lovely pictures.
p56
aVNo dice: no dodo skeleton for me. But the damage had been done.
p57
aVI had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons
p58
aVinto my "Creative Projects" folder \u2014
p59
aVit's a repository for my brain, everything that I could possibly be interested in.
p60
aVAny time I have an internet connection,
p61
aVthere's a sluice of stuff moving into there,
p62
aVeverything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos.
p63
aVThe key that the Marquis du Lafayette sent to George Washington
p64
aVto celebrate the storming of the Bastille.
p65
aVRussian nuclear launch key:
p66
aVThe one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay;
p67
aVthe one on the bottom is the one I made for myself,
p68
aVbecause I couldn't afford the one on eBay.
p69
aVStorm trooper costumes. Maps of Middle Earth \u2014
p70
aVthat's one I hand-drew myself. There's the dodo skeleton folder.
p71
aVThis folder has 17,000 photos \u2014
p72
aVover 20 gigabytes of information \u2014
p73
aVand it's growing constantly.
p74
aVAnd one day, a couple of weeks later, it might have been
p75
aVmaybe a year later, I was in the art store with my kids,
p76
aVand I was buying some clay tools \u2014 we were going to have a craft day.
p77
aVI bought some Super Sculpeys, some armature wire, some various materials.
p78
aVAnd I looked down at this Sculpey, and I thought,
p79
aVmaybe,
p80
aVyeah, maybe I could make my own dodo skull.
p81
aa(lp82
VI should point out at this time \u2014 I'm not a sculptor;
p83
aVI'm a hard-edged model maker.
p84
aVYou give me a drawing, you give me a prop to replicate,
p85
aVyou give me a crane, scaffolding, parts from "Star Wars" \u2014
p86
aVespecially parts from "Star Wars" \u2014
p87
aVI can do this stuff all day long.
p88
aVIt's exactly how I made my living for 15 years.
p89
aVBut you give me something like this \u2014
p90
aVmy friend Mike Murnane sculpted this;
p91
aVit's a maquette for "Star Wars, Episode Two" \u2014
p92
aVthis is not my thing \u2014
p93
aVthis is something other people do \u2014 dragons, soft things.
p94
aa(lp95
VHowever, I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls
p96
aVto actually be able to
p97
aVunderstand the topology and perhaps replicate it \u2014
p98
aVI mean, it couldn't be that difficult.
p99
aVSo, I started looking at the best photos I could find.
p100
aVI grabbed all the reference,
p101
aVand I found this lovely piece of reference.
p102
aVThis is someone selling this on eBay;
p103
aVit was clearly a woman\u2019s hand, hopefully a woman's hand.
p104
aVAssuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand,
p105
aVI made some measurements of her thumb, and I scaled them out to the size of the skull.
p106
aVI blew it up to the actual size, and I began using that,
p107
aValong with all the other reference that I had, comparing it to it
p108
aVas size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be,
p109
aVexactly how long, etc.
p110
aa(lp111
VAnd over a few hours, I eventually achieved
p112
aVwhat was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull. And I didn't mean to continue, I \u2014
p113
aVit's kind of like, you know, you can only clean a super messy room
p114
aVby picking up one thing at a time; you can't think about the totality.
p115
aVI wasn't thinking about a dodo skeleton;
p116
aVI just noticed that as I finished this skull,
p117
aVthe armature wire that I had been used to holding it up
p118
aVwas sticking out of the back just where a spine would be.
p119
aVAnd one of the other things I'd been interested in and obsessed with over the years
p120
aVis spines and skeletons, having collected a couple of hundred.
p121
aVI actually understood the mechanics
p122
aVof vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them.
p123
aVAnd so button by button,
p124
aVvertebrae by vertebrae, I built my way down.
p125
aVAnd actually, by the end of the day, I had a reasonable skull,
p126
aVa moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd again, I kept on going, looking for more reference,
p129
aVevery bit of reference I could find \u2014 drawings, beautiful photos.
p130
aVThis guy \u2014 I love this guy! He put a dodo leg bones on a scanner
p131
aVwith a ruler.
p132
aVThis is the kind of accuracy that I wanted,
p133
aVand I
p134
aVreplicated every last bone and put it in.
p135
aVAnd after about six weeks,
p136
aVI finished, painted, mounted
p137
aVmy own dodo skeleton.
p138
aVYou can see that I even made a museum label for it
p139
aVthat includes a brief history of the dodo.
p140
aVAnd TAP Plastics made me \u2014 although I didn't photograph it \u2014
p141
aVa museum vitrine.
p142
aVI don't have the room for this in my house,
p143
aVbut I had to finish what I had started.
p144
aa(lp145
VAnd this actually represented kind of a sea change to me.
p146
aVAgain, like I said, my life has been about
p147
aVbeing fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell,
p148
aVand also making them for myself, obtaining them,
p149
aVappreciating them and diving into them.
p150
aVAnd in this folder, "Creative Projects,"
p151
aVthere are tons of projects that I'm currently working on,
p152
aVprojects that I've already worked on, things that I might want to work on some day,
p153
aVand things that I may just want to find and buy and have
p154
aVand look at and touch.
p155
aVBut now there was potentially this new category of things
p156
aVthat I could sculpt
p157
aVthat was different, that I \u2014 you know,
p158
aVI have my own R2D2, but that's \u2014
p159
aVhonestly, relative to sculpting, to me, that's easy.
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd so I went back and looked through my "Creative Projects" folder,
p162
aVand I happened across the Maltese Falcon.
p163
aVNow, this is funny for me:
p164
aVto fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel,
p165
aVbecause if it's true that the world is divided into two types of people,
p166
aVChandler people and Hammett people, I am absolutely a Chandler person.
p167
aVBut in this case,
p168
aVit's not about the author, it's not about the book or the movie or the story,
p169
aVit's about the object in and of itself.
p170
aVAnd in this case, this object is \u2014
p171
aVplays on a host of levels.
p172
aa(lp173
VFirst of all, there's the object in the world.
p174
aVThis is the "Kniphausen Hawk."
p175
aVIt is a ceremonial pouring vessel
p176
aVmade around 1700 for a Swedish Count,
p177
aVand it is very likely the object from which
p178
aVHammett drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon.
p179
aVThen there is the fictional bird, the one that Hammett created for the book.
p180
aVBuilt out of words, it is the engine
p181
aVthat drives the plot of his book and also the movie,
p182
aVin which another object is created:
p183
aVa prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words,
p184
aVinspired by the Kniphausen Hawk, and this represents the falcon in the movie.
p185
aVAnd then there is this fourth level, which is
p186
aVa whole new object in the world:
p187
aVthe prop made for the movie, the representative of the thing,
p188
aVbecomes, in its own right,
p189
aVa whole other thing,
p190
aVa whole new object of desire.
p191
aa(lp192
VAnd so now it was time to do some research.
p193
aVI actually had done some research
p194
aVa few years before \u2014 it's why the folder was there.
p195
aVI'd bought a replica, a really crappy replica,
p196
aVof the Maltese Falcon on eBay,
p197
aVand had downloaded enough pictures to actually
p198
aVhave some reasonable reference.
p199
aVBut I discovered,
p200
aVin researching further,
p201
aVreally wanting precise reference, that
p202
aVone of the original lead birds
p203
aVhad been sold at Christie's in 1994,
p204
aVand so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller
p205
aVwho had the original Christie's catalogue,
p206
aVand in it I found this magnificent picture,
p207
aVwhich included a size reference.
p208
aVI was able to scan the picture, blow it up to exactly full size.
p209
aa(lp210
VI found other reference. Avi [Ara] Chekmayan,
p211
aVa New Jersey editor, actually found this
p212
aVresin Maltese Falcon
p213
aVat a flea market in 1991,
p214
aValthough it took him five years
p215
aVto authenticate this bird to
p216
aVthe auctioneers' specifications,
p217
aVbecause there was a lot of controversy about it.
p218
aVIt was made out of resin, which wasn't a common material for movie props
p219
aVabout the time the movie was made.
p220
aVIt's funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it,
p221
aVbecause I can see it compared to this thing,
p222
aVand I can tell you \u2014 it's real, it's the real thing,
p223
aVit's made from the exact same mold that this one is.
p224
aVIn this one, because the auction was actually so controversial,
p225
aVProfiles in History, the auction house that sold this \u2014
p226
aVI think in 1995 for about 100,000 dollars \u2014
p227
aVthey actually included \u2014 you can see here on the bottom \u2014
p228
aVnot just a front elevation, but also
p229
aVa side, rear
p230
aVand other side elevation.
p231
aa(lp232
VSo now, I had all the topology I needed
p233
aVto replicate the Maltese Falcon.
p234
aVWhat do they do, how do you start something like that? I really don't know.
p235
aVSo what I did was, again, like I did with the dodo skull,
p236
aVI blew all my reference up to full size,
p237
aVand then I began cutting out the negatives and using
p238
aVthose templates as shape references.
p239
aVSo I took Sculpey, and I built a big block of it,
p240
aVand I passed it through until, you know, I got the right profiles.
p241
aVAnd then slowly, feather by feather, detail by detail,
p242
aVI worked out and achieved \u2014
p243
aVworking in front of the television and Super Sculpey \u2014
p244
aVhere's me sitting next to my wife \u2014
p245
aVit's the only picture I took of the entire process.
p246
aVAs I moved through, I achieved
p247
aVa very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon.
p248
aVBut again, I am not a sculptor,
p249
aa(lp250
Vand so I don't know a lot of the tricks, like,
p251
aVI don't know how my friend Mike gets beautiful, shiny surfaces with his Sculpey;
p252
aVI certainly wasn't able to get it.
p253
aVSo, I went down to my shop,
p254
aVand I molded it and I cast it in resin,
p255
aVbecause in the resin, then, I could absolutely get the glass smooth finished.
p256
aVNow there's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish.
p257
aVMy preference is about 70 coats of this \u2014
p258
aVmatte black auto primer.
p259
aVI spray it on for about three or four days, it drips to hell,
p260
aVbut it allows me a really, really nice gentle sanding surface
p261
aVand I can get it glass-smooth.
p262
aVOh, finishing up with triple-zero steel wool.
p263
aVNow, the great thing about getting it to this point was that
p264
aVbecause in the movie, when they finally bring out the bird at the end,
p265
aVand they place it on the table, they actually spin it.
p266
aVSo I was able to actually
p267
aVscreen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure.
p268
aVAnd I'm following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I'm holding the light
p269
aVin the same position, I'm getting the same type of reflection on it \u2014
p270
aVthat's the level of detail I'm going into this thing.
p271
aVI ended up with this: my Maltese Falcon.
p272
aVAnd it's beautiful. And I can state with authority
p273
aVat this point in time, when I'd finished it,
p274
aVof all of the replicas out there \u2014 and there is a few \u2014
p275
aVthis is by far the most accurate
p276
aVrepresentation of the original Maltese Falcon
p277
aVthan anyone has sculpted. Now the original one, I should tell you,
p278
aa(lp279
Vis sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton.
p280
aVThis is where it gets weird.
p281
aVFred Sexton was a friend of this guy, George Hodel.
p282
aVTerrifying guy \u2014 agreed by many to be the killer
p283
aVof the Black Dahlia.
p284
aVNow, James Ellroy believes
p285
aVthat Fred Sexton, the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon,
p286
aVkilled James Elroy's mother.
p287
aVI'll go you one stranger than that: In 1974,
p288
aVduring the production of a weird comedy sequel to "The Maltese Falcon,"
p289
aVcalled "The Black Bird," starring George Segal,
p290
aVthe Los Angeles County Museum of Art
p291
aVhad a plaster original of the Maltese Falcon \u2014
p292
aVone of the original six plasters, I think, made for the movie \u2014
p293
aVstolen out of the museum. A lot of people thought
p294
aVit was a publicity stunt for the movie.
p295
aVJohn's Grill, which actually
p296
aVis seen briefly in "The Maltese Falcon,"
p297
aVis still a viable San Francisco eatery,
p298
aVcounted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook,
p299
aVwho played Wilmer Cook in the movie,
p300
aVand he gave them
p301
aVone of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon.
p302
aVAnd they had it in their cabinet for about 15 years,
p303
aVuntil it got stolen
p304
aVin January of 2007.
p305
aVIt would seem that the object of desire
p306
aVonly comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo here I had this Falcon,
p309
aVand it was lovely. It looked really great,
p310
aVthe light worked on it really well,
p311
aVit was better than anything that I could achieve
p312
aVor obtain out in the world.
p313
aVBut there was a problem. And the problem was that:
p314
aVI wanted the entirety of the object,
p315
aVI wanted the weight behind the object.
p316
aVThis thing was made of resin and it was too light.
p317
aVThere's this group online that I frequent.
p318
aVIt's a group of prop crazies just like me
p319
aVcalled the Replica Props Forum, and it's people who trade,
p320
aVmake and travel in information about movie props.
p321
aVAnd it turned out that one of the guys there,
p322
aVa friend of mine that I never actually met,
p323
aVbut befriended through some prop deals, was the manager of a local foundry.
p324
aVHe took my master Falcon pattern,
p325
aVhe actually did lost wax casting
p326
aVin bronze for me,
p327
aVand this is the bronze I got back.
p328
aVAnd this is, after some acid etching, the one that I ended up with.
p329
aa(lp330
VAnd this thing, it's deeply, deeply satisfying to me.
p331
aVHere, I'm going to put it out there,
p332
aVlater on tonight, and
p333
aVI want you to pick it up and handle it.
p334
aVYou want to know
p335
aVhow obsessed I am. This project's only for me,
p336
aVand yet I went so far as to buy on eBay
p337
aVa 1941 Chinese San Francisco-based newspaper,
p338
aVin order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ...
p339
aVlike it is in the movie.
p340
aV(Laughter)
p341
aVYeah, I know!
p342
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p343
aVThere you can see, it's weighing in at 27 and a half pounds.
p344
aVThat's half the weight of my dog, Huxley.
p345
aa(lp346
VBut there's a problem.
p347
aVNow, here's the most recent progression of Falcons.
p348
aVOn the far left is a piece of crap \u2014 a replica I bought on eBay.
p349
aVThere's my somewhat ruined Sculpey Falcon,
p350
aVbecause I had to get it back out of the mold. There's my first casting,
p351
aVthere's my master and there's my bronze.
p352
aVThere's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things,
p353
aVwhich is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin,
p354
aVyou lose a little bit of volume, you lose a little bit of size.
p355
aVAnd when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one,
p356
aVit was shorter by three-quarters of an inch.
p357
aVYeah, no, really, this was like aah \u2014
p358
aVwhy didn't I remember this?
p359
aVWhy didn't I start and make it bigger?
p360
aVSo what do I do? I figure I have two options.
p361
aVOne, I can fire a freaking laser at it,
p362
aVwhich I have already done,
p363
aVto do a 3D scan \u2014 there's a 3D scan of this Falcon.
p364
aVI had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieved
p365
aVgoing from a wax master to a bronze master
p366
aVand blown this up big enough to make
p367
aVa 3D lithography master of this,
p368
aVwhich I will polish, then I will send to the mold maker
p369
aVand then I will have it done in bronze. Or:
p370
aa(lp371
VThere are several people who own originals,
p372
aVand I have been attempting to contact them and reach them,
p373
aVhoping that they will let me spend a few minutes
p374
aVin the presence of one of the real birds, maybe to take a picture,
p375
aVor even to pull out the hand-held laser scanner
p376
aVthat I happen to own that fits inside a cereal box,
p377
aVand could maybe, without even touching their bird, I swear,
p378
aVget a perfect 3D scan. And I'm even willing to sign pages
p379
aVsaying that I'll never let anyone else have it, except for me in my office, I promise.
p380
aVI'll give them one if they want it.
p381
aVAnd then, maybe, then I'll achieve the end of this exercise.
p382
aVBut really, if we're all going to be honest with ourselves,
p383
aVI have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise
p384
aVwas never the point of the exercise to begin with, was it.
p385
aVThank you.
