VI would like to start
p4
aVwith the story of Mary,
p5
aVa woman from an African village.
p6
aVHer first memories
p7
aVare of her family fleeing violent riots
p8
aVorchestrated by  the ruling political party.
p9
aVHer brother was murdered by the state-sponsored militia,
p10
aVand she was raped more than once
p11
aVjust because she belonged to the wrong party.
p12
aa(lp13
VOne morning, a month before the election,
p14
aVMary's village was called  to another intimidation meeting.
p15
aVIn this meeting, there is a man standing in front of them,
p16
aVtelling them, "We know who you are,
p17
aVwe know who you will vote for,
p18
aVand if you're not going to drop the right paper,
p19
aVwe're going to take revenge."
p20
aVBut for Mary, this meeting is different.
p21
aVShe feels different.
p22
aVThis time, she's waiting for this meeting,
p23
aVbecause this time, she's carrying a small hidden camera in her dress,
p24
aVa camera that nobody else can see.
p25
aVNobody is allowed to film in these meetings.
p26
aVYou risk your life if you do.
p27
aVMary knows that, but she also knows that the only way to stop them
p28
aVand to protect herself and her community
p29
aVis to expose their intimidation,
p30
aVto make sure they understand somebody is following them,
p31
aVto break the impunity they feel.
p32
aVMary and her friends were filming for months, undercover,
p33
aVthe intimidation of the ruling political party.

p40
aVwe will not forgive you.

aa(lp59
VOren Yakobovich: These images were broadcast all over the world,
p60
aVbut more importantly,
p61
aVthey have been broadcast back to the community.
p62
aVThe perpetrators saw them too.
p63
aVThey understood somebody is following them.
p64
aVThey got scared. Impunity was broken.
p65
aVMary and her friends forced the ruling political party
p66
aVnot to use violence during the election,
p67
aVand saved hundreds of lives.
p68
aVMary is just one of hundreds of people
p69
aVthat my organization had helped  to document human rights violations
p70
aVusing cameras.
p71
aa(lp72
VMy background should have led me to a different direction.
p73
aVI was born in Israel to a right-wing family,
p74
aVand as long as I remember myself,
p75
aVI wanted to join the Israeli army to serve my country
p76
aVand prove what I believed  was our right for the whole land.
p77
aVI joined the Israeli army  just after the first intifada,
p78
aVthe first Palestinian uprising,
p79
aVand I served in one of the hard-minded,
p80
aVtoughest, aggressive infantry units,
p81
aVand I got the biggest gun in my platoon.
p82
aVQuite fast, I became an officer
p83
aVand got soldiers under my command,
p84
aVand as time passed, I started serving in the West Bank,
p85
aVand I saw these images.
p86
aVI didn't like what I saw.
p87
aVIt took me a while,
p88
aVbut eventually I refused to serve in the West Bank
p89
aVand had to spend time in jail.
p90
aVIt was a bit \u2014
p91
aV(Applause) \u2014
p92
aVIt was not that bad, I have to say.
p93
aVIt was a bit like being in a hotel, but with very shitty food.
p94
aV(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VIn jail, I kept thinking  that I need people to know.
p97
aVI need people to understand
p98
aVwhat the reality in the West Bank looks like.
p99
aVI need them to hear what I heard,
p100
aVI need them to see what I saw,
p101
aVbut I also understood, we need  the Palestinians themselves,
p102
aVthe people that are suffering,
p103
aVto be able to tell their own stories,
p104
aVnot journalists or filmmakers that are coming outside of the situation.
p105
aa(lp106
VI joined a human rights organization,
p107
aVan Israeli human rights  organization called B'Tselem.
p108
aVTogether, we analyzed the West Bank
p109
aVand picked 100 families that are living in the most risky places:
p110
aVclose to checkpoints, near army bases,
p111
aVside by side with settlers.
p112
aVWe gave them cameras and training.
p113
aVQuite fast, we started getting very disturbing images
p114
aVabout how the settlers  and the soldiers are abusing them.
p115
aa(lp116
VI would like to share with you two clips from this project.
p117
aVBoth of them were broadcast in Israel, and it created a massive debate.
p118
aVAnd I have to warn you,
p119
aVsome of you might  find them quite explicit.
p120
aVThe masked men you  will see in the first clips
p121
aVare Jewish settlers.
p122
aVMinutes before the camera was turned on,
p123
aVthey approached a Palestinian family
p124
aVthat was working their land
p125
aVand told them that they have to leave the land,
p126
aVbecause this land belongs to the Jewish settlers.
p127
aVThe Palestinians refused.
p128
aVLet's see what happened.
p129
aVThe masked men that are approaching are Jewish settlers.
p130
aVThey are approaching the Palestinian family.
p131
aVThis is a demonstration in the West Bank.
p132
aVThe guy in green is Palestinian.
p133
aVHe will be arrested in a second.
p134
aVHere you see him blindfolded and handcuffed.
p135
aVIn a few seconds, he regrets  he came to this demonstration.
p136
aVHe's been shot in the foot with a rubber bullet.
p137
aVHe is okay.
p138
aa(lp139
VNot all the settlers and the soldiers are acting this way.
p140
aVWe're talking about a tiny minority, but they have to be brought to justice.
p141
aVThese clips, and others like them,
p142
aVforced the army and the police to start investigations.
p143
aVThey've been shown in Israel, of course,
p144
aVand the Israeli public was exposed to them also.
p145
aVThis project redefined the struggle for human rights
p146
aVin the occupied territories,
p147
aVand we managed to reduce the number  of violent attacks in the West Bank.
p148
aa(lp149
VThe success of this project got me thinking
p150
aVhow I can take the same methodology to other places in the world.
p151
aVNow, we tend to believe that today,
p152
aVwith all of the technology,
p153
aVthe smartphones and the Internet,
p154
aVwe are able to see and understand most of what's happening in the world,
p155
aVand people are able to tell their story \u2014
p156
aVbut it's only partly true.
p157
aVStill today, with all the technology we have,
p158
aVless than half of the world's population
p159
aVhas access to the Internet,
p160
aVand more than three billion people \u2014
p161
aVI'm repeating the number \u2014
p162
aVthree billion people are consuming news that is censored by those in power.
p163
aVMore or less around the same time,
p164
aVI'm approached by a great guy named Uri Fruchtmann.
p165
aVHe's a filmmaker and an activist.
p166
aVWe understood we were thinking along the same lines,
p167
aVand we decided to establish Videre, our organization, together.
p168
aVWhile building the organization in London,
p169
aVwe've been traveling undercover to places
p170
aVwhere a community  was suffering from abuses,
p171
aVwhere mass atrocities were happening,
p172
aVand there was a lack of reporting.
p173
aVWe tried to understand how we can help.
p174
aa(lp175
VThere were four things that I learned.
p176
aVThe first thing is that we have to engage
p177
aVwith communities that are living in rural areas,
p178
aVwhere violations are happening far from the public eye.
p179
aVWe need to partner with them,
p180
aVand we need to understand which images are not making it out there
p181
aVand help them to document them.
p182
aa(lp183
VThe second thing I learned
p184
aVis that we have to enable them  to film in a safe way.
p185
aVSecurity has to be the priority.
p186
aVWhere I used to work before, in the West Bank,
p187
aVone can take a camera out,
p188
aVmost likely not going to get shot,
p189
aVbut in places we wanted to work,
p190
aVjust try to pull a phone out, and you're dead \u2014 literally dead.
p191
aVThis is why we decided
p192
aVto take the operation undercover
p193
aVwhen necessary,
p194
aVand use mostly hidden cameras.
p195
aVUnfortunately, I can't show you the hidden cameras we're using today \u2014
p196
aVfor obvious reasons \u2014
p197
aVbut these are cameras we used before.
p198
aVYou can buy them off the shelf.
p199
aVToday, we're building  a custom-made hidden camera,
p200
aVlike the one that Mary was wearing
p201
aVin her dress to film the intimidation meeting
p202
aVof the ruling political party.
p203
aVIt's a camera that nobody can see,
p204
aVthat blends into the environment,
p205
aVinto the surroundings.
p206
aVNow, filming securities go beyond using hidden cameras.
p207
aVBeing secure starts way before the activist is turning the camera on.
p208
aVTo keep our partners safe,
p209
aVwe work to understand the risk of every location
p210
aVand of every shot before it's happened,
p211
aVbuilding a backup plan if something goes wrong,
p212
aVand making sure  we have everything in place
p213
aVbefore our operations start.
p214
aa(lp215
VThe third thing I learned is the importance of verification.
p216
aVYou can have an amazing shot of atrocity,
p217
aVbut if you can't verify it, it's worth nothing.
p218
aVRecently, like in the ongoing war  in Syria or the war in Gaza,
p219
aVwe've seen images that are staged  or brought from a different conflict.
p220
aVThis misinformation destroyed the credibility of the source,
p221
aVand it's harmed the credibility of other reliable and trustworthy sources.
p222
aVWe use a variety of ways to make sure we can verify the information
p223
aVand we can trust the material.
p224
aVIt starts with vetting the partners,
p225
aVunderstanding who they are, and working with them very intensively.
p226
aVHow do you film a location?
p227
aVYou film road signs, you film watches,
p228
aVyou film newspapers.
p229
aVWe are checking maps, looking at maps,
p230
aVdouble-checking the information,
p231
aVand looking also at  the metadata of the material.
p232
aa(lp233
VNow, the fourth and the most important thing I learned
p234
aVis how you use images  to create a positive change.
p235
aVTo have an effect,
p236
aVthe key thing is how you use the material.
p237
aa(lp238
VToday, we're working with hundreds of activists
p239
aVfilming undercover.
p240
aVWe work with them both to understand  the situation on the ground
p241
aVand which images  are missing to describe it,
p242
aVwho are the ones that are  influencing the situation,
p243
aVand when to release the material to advance the struggle.
p244
aVSometimes, it's about putting it in the media,
p245
aVmostly local ones, to create awareness.
p246
aVSometimes it's working with decision makers,
p247
aVto change laws.
p248
aVSometimes, it's working with lawyers to use as evidence in court.
p249
aVBut more than often,
p250
aVthe most effective way to create a social change
p251
aVis to work within the community.
p252
aa(lp253
VI want to give you one example.
p254
aVFatuma is part of a network of women that are fighting abuses in Kenya.
p255
aVWomen in her community have been harassed constantly
p256
aVon their way to school and on their way to work.
p257
aVThey are trying to change  the behavior of the community from inside.
p258
aVIn the next clip,
p259
aVFatuma is taking us with her on her journey to work.
p260
aVHer voice is superimposed on images that she filmed herself
p261
aVusing hidden cameras.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Video) Fatuma Chiusiku:  My name is Fatuma Chiusiku.
p264
aVI'm 32 years old, a mother,
p265
aVAnd Ziwa La Ng'Ombe is my home.
p266
aVEach morning, I ride the mini-bus
p267
aVNumber 11.
p268
aVBut instead of a peaceful journey to work,
p269
aVeach day begins with fear.
p270
aVCome with me now
p271
aVand use my eyes
p272
aVto feel what I feel.
p273
aVAs I walk, I think to myself:
p274
aVWill I be touched?
p275
aVGrabbed?
p276
aVViolated by this conductor again?
p277
aVEven the men inside
p278
aVthe way they look at me
p279
aVtouch my body, rub against me,
p280
aVgrab me,
p281
aVand now, as I sit in my seat
p282
aVI only wish my mind was full of thoughts for my day,
p283
aVmy dreams, my children at school,
p284
aVbut instead I worry about the moment when we will arrive
p285
aVand I will be violated again.
p286
aa(lp287
VOY: Today, there is a new front in the fight for human rights.
p288
aVI used to carry a big gun.
p289
aVNow, I am carrying this.
p290
aVThis is a much more powerful and much, much more effective weapon.
p291
aVBut we have to use its power wisely.
p292
aVBy putting the right images in the right hands at the right time,
p293
aVwe can truly create an impact.
p294
aa(lp295
VThank you.
