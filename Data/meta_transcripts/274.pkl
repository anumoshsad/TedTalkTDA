VHow do groups get anything done? Right?
p4
aVHow do you organize a group of individuals
p5
aVso that the output of the group
p6
aVis something coherent and of lasting value,
p7
aVinstead of just being chaos?
p8
aVAnd the economic framing of that problem
p9
aVis called coordination costs.
p10
aVAnd a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial
p11
aVor institutional difficulties in arranging group output.
p12
aVAnd we've had a classic answer for coordination costs,
p13
aVwhich is, if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people,
p14
aVyou start an institution, right? You raise some resources.
p15
aVYou found something. It can be private or public.
p16
aVIt can be for profit or not profit. It can be large or small.
p17
aVBut you get these resources together.
p18
aVYou found an institution, and you use the institution
p19
aVto coordinate the activities of the group.
p20
aa(lp21
VMore recently, because the cost of letting groups
p22
aVcommunicate with each other has fallen through the floor \u2014
p23
aVand communication costs are one of the big
p24
aVinputs to coordination \u2014 there has been a second answer,
p25
aVwhich is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure,
p26
aVto design systems that coordinate the output
p27
aVof the group as a by-product of the operating of the system,
p28
aVwithout regard to institutional models.
p29
aVSo, that's what I want to talk about today.
p30
aVI'm going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples,
p31
aVbut always pointing to the broader themes.
p32
aa(lp33
VSo, I'm going to start by trying to answer a question
p34
aVthat I know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other,
p35
aVand which the Internet is purpose-built to answer,
p36
aVwhich is, where can I get a picture of a roller-skating mermaid?
p37
aVSo, in New York City, on the first Saturday of every summer,
p38
aVConey Island, our local, charmingly run-down amusement park,
p39
aVhosts the Mermaid Parade. It's an amateur parade;
p40
aVpeople come from all over the city; people get all dressed up.
p41
aVSome people get less dressed up.
p42
aVYoung and old, dancing in the streets.
p43
aVColorful characters, and a good time is had by all.
p44
aVAnd what I want to call your attention to is not the Mermaid Parade itself,
p45
aVcharming though it is, but rather to these photos.
p46
aVI didn't take them. How did I get them?
p47
aVAnd the answer is: I got them from Flickr.
p48
aa(lp49
VFlickr is a photo-sharing service
p50
aVthat allows people to take photos, upload them,
p51
aVshare them over the Web and so forth.
p52
aVRecently, Flickr has added an additional function called tagging.
p53
aVTagging was pioneered by Delicious and Joshua Schachter.
p54
aVDelicious is a social bookmarking service.
p55
aVTagging is a cooperative infrastructure answer to classification.
p56
aVRight? If I had given this talk last year,
p57
aVI couldn't do what I just did,
p58
aVbecause I couldn't have found those photos.
p59
aVBut instead of saying,
p60
aVwe need to hire a professional class of librarians
p61
aVto organize these photos once they're uploaded,
p62
aVFlickr simply turned over to the users
p63
aVthe ability to characterize the photos.
p64
aVSo, I was able to go in and draw down photos that had been tagged
p65
aV"Mermaid Parade." There were 3,100 photos taken by 118 photographers,
p66
aVall aggregated and then put under this nice, neat name,
p67
aVshown in reverse chronological order.
p68
aVAnd I was then able to go and retrieve them
p69
aVto give you that little slideshow.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow, what hard problem is being solved here?
p72
aVAnd it's \u2014 in the most schematic possible view,
p73
aVit's a coordination problem, right?
p74
aVThere are a large number of people on the Internet,
p75
aVa very small fraction of them have photos of the Mermaid Parade.
p76
aVHow do we get those people together to contribute that work?
p77
aVThe classic answer is to form an institution, right?
p78
aVTo draw those people into some prearranged structure
p79
aVthat has explicit goals.
p80
aVAnd I want to call your attention to
p81
aVsome of the side effects of going the institutional route.
p82
aa(lp83
VFirst of all, when you form an institution,
p84
aVyou take on a management problem, right?
p85
aVNo good just hiring employees,
p86
aVyou also have to hire other employees to manage those employees
p87
aVand to enforce the goals of the institution and so forth.
p88
aVSecondly, you have to bring structure into place.
p89
aVRight? You have to have economic structure.
p90
aVYou have to have legal structure.
p91
aVYou have to have physical structure.
p92
aVAnd that creates additional costs.
p93
aVThird, forming an institution is inherently exclusionary.
p94
aVYou notice we haven't got everybody who has a photo.
p95
aVYou can't hire everyone in a company, right?
p96
aVYou can't recruit everyone into a governmental organization.
p97
aVYou have to exclude some people.
p98
aVAnd fourth, as a result of that exclusion,
p99
aVyou end up with a professional class. Look at the change here.
p100
aVWe've gone from people with photos to photographers.
p101
aVRight? We've created a professional class of photographers
p102
aVwhose goal is to go out and photograph the Mermaid Parade,
p103
aVor whatever else they're sent out to photograph.
p104
aa(lp105
VWhen you build cooperation into the infrastructure,
p106
aVwhich is the Flickr answer,
p107
aVyou can leave the people where they are
p108
aVand you take the problem to the individuals, rather than
p109
aVmoving the individuals to the problem.
p110
aVYou arrange the coordination in the group, and by doing that
p111
aVyou get the same outcome, without the institutional difficulties.
p112
aVYou lose the institutional imperative.
p113
aVYou lose the right to shape people's work when it's volunteer effort,
p114
aVbut you also shed the institutional cost,
p115
aVwhich gives you greater flexibility.
p116
aVWhat Flickr does is it replaces planning with coordination.
p117
aVAnd this is a general aspect of these cooperative systems.
p118
aa(lp119
VRight. You'll have experienced this in your life
p120
aVwhenever you bought your first mobile phone,
p121
aVand you stopped making plans.
p122
aVYou just said, "I'll call you when I get there."
p123
aV"Call me when you get off work." Right?
p124
aVThat is a point-to-point replacement of coordination with planning.
p125
aVRight. We're now able to do that kind of thing with groups.
p126
aVTo say instead of, we must make an advance plan,
p127
aVwe must have a five-year projection
p128
aVof where the Wikipedia is going to be, or whatever,
p129
aVyou can just say, let's coordinate the group effort,
p130
aVand let's deal with it as we go,
p131
aVbecause we're now well-enough coordinated
p132
aVthat we don't have to take on the problems of deciding in advance what to do.
p133
aa(lp134
VSo here's another example. This one's somewhat more somber.
p135
aVThese are photos on Flickr tagged "Iraq."
p136
aVAnd everything that was hard about the coordination cost
p137
aVwith the Mermaid Parade is even harder here.
p138
aVThere are more pictures. There are more photographers.
p139
aVIt's taken over a wider geographic area.
p140
aVThe photos are spread out over a longer period of time.
p141
aVAnd worst of all, that figure at the bottom,
p142
aVapproximately ten photos per photographer, is a lie.
p143
aVIt's mathematically true,
p144
aVbut it doesn't really talk about anything important \u2014
p145
aVbecause in these systems, the average isn't really what matters.
p146
aa(lp147
VWhat matters is this.
p148
aVThis is a graph of photographs tagged Iraq
p149
aVas taken by the 529 photographers who contributed the 5,445 photos.
p150
aVAnd it's ranked in order of number of photos taken per photographer.
p151
aVYou can see here, over at the end,
p152
aVour most prolific photographer has taken around 350 photos,
p153
aVand you can see there's a few people who have taken hundreds of photos.
p154
aVThen there's dozens of people who've taken dozens of photos.
p155
aVAnd by the time we get around here,
p156
aVwe get ten or fewer photos, and then there's this long, flat tail.
p157
aVAnd by the time you get to the middle,
p158
aVyou've got hundreds of people
p159
aVwho have contributed only one photo each.
p160
aa(lp161
VThis is called a power-law distribution.
p162
aVIt appears often in unconstrained social systems
p163
aVwhere people are allowed to contribute as much or as little as they like \u2014
p164
aVthis is often what you get. Right?
p165
aVThe math behind the power-law distribution is that whatever's in the nth position
p166
aVis doing about one-nth of whatever's being measured,
p167
aVrelative to the person in the first position.
p168
aVSo, we'd expect the tenth most prolific photographer
p169
aVto have contributed about a tenth of the photos,
p170
aVand the hundredth most prolific photographer
p171
aVto have contributed only about a hundred as many photos
p172
aVas the most prolific photographer did.
p173
aVSo, the head of the curve can be sharper or flatter.
p174
aVBut that basic math accounts both for the steep slope
p175
aVand for the long, flat tail.
p176
aa(lp177
VAnd curiously, in these systems, as they grow larger,
p178
aVthe systems don't converge; they diverge more.
p179
aVIn bigger systems, the head gets bigger
p180
aVand the tail gets longer, so the imbalance increases.
p181
aVYou can see the curve is obviously heavily left-weighted. Here's how heavily:
p182
aVif you take the top 10 percent of photographers contributing to this system,
p183
aVthey account for three quarters of the photos taken \u2014
p184
aVjust the top 10 percent most prolific photographers.
p185
aVIf you go down to five percent,
p186
aVyou're still accounting for 60 percent of the photos.
p187
aVIf you go down to one percent, exclude 99 percent of the group effort,
p188
aVyou're still accounting for almost a quarter of the photos.
p189
aVAnd because of this left weighting,
p190
aVthe average is actually here, way to the left.
p191
aVAnd that sounds strange to our ears,
p192
aVbut what ends up happening is that 80 percent of the contributors
p193
aVhave contributed a below-average amount.
p194
aVThat sounds strange because we expect average and middle
p195
aVto be about the same, but they're not at all.
p196
aa(lp197
VThis is the math underlying the 80/20 rule. Right?
p198
aVWhenever you hear anybody talking about the 80/20 rule,
p199
aVthis is what's going on. Right?
p200
aV20 percent of the merchandise accounts for 80 percent of the revenue,
p201
aV20 percent of the users use 80 percent of the resources \u2014
p202
aVthis is the shape people are talking about when that happens.
p203
aVInstitutions only have two tools: carrots and sticks.
p204
aVAnd the 80 percent zone is a no-carrot and no-stick zone.
p205
aVThe costs of running the institution mean that you cannot
p206
aVtake on the work of those people easily in an institutional frame.
p207
aVThe institutional model always pushes leftwards,
p208
aVtreating these people as employees.
p209
aVThe institutional response is,
p210
aVI can get 75 percent of the value for 10 percent of the hires \u2014 great,
p211
aVthat's what I'll do.
p212
aVThe cooperative infrastructure model says,
p213
aVwhy do you want to give up a quarter of the value?
p214
aVIf your system is designed
p215
aVso that you have to give up a quarter of the value,
p216
aVre-engineer the system.
p217
aVDon't take on the cost that prevents you
p218
aVfrom getting to the contributions of these people.
p219
aVBuild the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount.
p220
aa(lp221
VSo the coordination response asks not,
p222
aVhow are these people as employees, but rather,
p223
aVwhat is their contribution like? Right?
p224
aVWe have over here Psycho Milt, a Flickr user,
p225
aVwho has contributed one, and only one, photo titled "Iraq."
p226
aVAnd here's the photo. Right. Labeled, "Bad Day at Work."
p227
aVRight? So the question is,
p228
aVdo you want that photo? Yes or no.
p229
aVThe question is not, is Psycho Milt a good employee?
p230
aa(lp231
VAnd the tension here is between institution as enabler
p232
aVand institution as obstacle.
p233
aVWhen you're dealing with the left-hand edge
p234
aVof one of these distributions,
p235
aVwhen you're dealing with the people who spend a lot of time
p236
aVproducing a lot of the material you want,
p237
aVthat's an institution-as-enabler world.
p238
aVYou can hire those people as employees, you can coordinate their work
p239
aVand you can get some output.
p240
aVBut when you're down here, where the Psycho Milts of the world
p241
aVare adding one photo at a time,
p242
aVthat's institution as obstacle.
p243
aa(lp244
VInstitutions hate being told they're obstacles.
p245
aVOne of the first things that happens
p246
aVwhen you institutionalize a problem
p247
aVis that the first goal of the institution
p248
aVimmediately shifts from whatever the nominal goal was
p249
aVto self-preservation.
p250
aVAnd the actual goal of the institution goes to two through n.
p251
aVRight? So, when institutions are told they are obstacles,
p252
aVand that there are other ways of coordinating the value,
p253
aVthey go through something a little bit like the Kubler-Ross stages \u2014
p254
aV(Laughter)
p255
aV\u2014 of reaction, being told you have a fatal illness:
p256
aVdenial, anger, bargaining, acceptance.
p257
aVMost of the cooperative systems we've seen
p258
aVhaven't been around long enough
p259
aVto have gotten to the acceptance phase.
p260
aa(lp261
VMany, many institutions are still in denial,
p262
aVbut we're seeing recently a lot of both anger and bargaining.
p263
aVThere's a wonderful, small example going on right now.
p264
aVIn France, a bus company is suing people for forming a carpool,
p265
aVright, because the fact that they have coordinated
p266
aVthemselves to create cooperative value is depriving them of revenue.
p267
aVYou can follow this in the Guardian.
p268
aVIt's actually quite entertaining.
p269
aa(lp270
VThe bigger question is,
p271
aVwhat do you do about the value down here?
p272
aVRight? How do you capture that?
p273
aVAnd institutions, as I've said, are prevented from capturing that.
p274
aVSteve Ballmer, now CEO of Microsoft,
p275
aVwas criticizing Linux a couple of years ago, and he said,
p276
aV"Oh, this business of thousands of programmers
p277
aVcontributing to Linux, this is a myth.
p278
aVWe've looked at who's contributed to Linux,
p279
aVand most of the patches have been produced by programmers
p280
aVwho've only done one thing." Right?
p281
aVYou can hear this distribution under that complaint.
p282
aVAnd you can see why, from Ballmer's point of view,
p283
aVthat's a bad idea, right?
p284
aVWe hired this programmer, he came in, he drank our Cokes
p285
aVand played Foosball for three years and he had one idea.
p286
aV(Laughter)
p287
aVRight? Bad hire. Right?
p288
aV(Laughter)
p289
aa(lp290
VThe Psycho Milt question is, was it a good idea?
p291
aVWhat if it was a security patch?
p292
aVWhat if it was a security patch for a buffer overflow exploit,
p293
aVof which Windows has not some, [but] several?
p294
aVDo you want that patch, right?
p295
aVThe fact that a single programmer can,
p296
aVwithout having to move into a professional relation
p297
aVto an institution, improve Linux once
p298
aVand never be seen from again, should terrify Ballmer.
p299
aVBecause this kind of value is unreachable in classic
p300
aVinstitutional frameworks, but is part of cooperative
p301
aVsystems of open-source software, of file sharing,
p302
aa(lp303
Vof the Wikipedia. I've used a lot of examples from Flickr,
p304
aVbut there are actually stories about this from all over.
p305
aVMeetup, a service founded so that users could find people
p306
aVin their local area who share their interests and affinities
p307
aVand actually have a real-world meeting offline in a cafe
p308
aVor a pub or what have you.
p309
aVWhen Scott Heiferman founded Meetup,
p310
aVhe thought it would be used for, you know,
p311
aVtrain spotters and cat fanciers \u2014 classic affinity groups.
p312
aVThe inventors don't know what the invention is.
p313
aVNumber one group on Meetup right now,
p314
aVmost chapters in most cities with most members, most active?
p315
aVStay-at-home moms. Right?
p316
aVIn the suburbanized, dual-income United States,
p317
aVstay-at-home moms are actually missing
p318
aVthe social infrastructure that comes from extended family
p319
aVand local, small-scale neighborhoods.
p320
aVSo they're reinventing it, using these tools.
p321
aVMeetup is the platform,
p322
aVbut the value here is in social infrastructure.
p323
aVIf you want to know what technology is going to change the world,
p324
aVdon't pay attention to 13-year-old boys \u2014
p325
aVpay attention to young mothers,
p326
aVbecause they have got not an ounce of support for technology
p327
aVthat doesn't materially make their lives better.
p328
aVThis is so much more important than Xbox,
p329
aVbut it's a lot less glitzy.
p330
aa(lp331
VI think this is a revolution.
p332
aVI think that this is a really profound change
p333
aVin the way human affairs are arranged.
p334
aVAnd I use that word advisedly.
p335
aVIt's a revolution in that it's a change in equilibrium.
p336
aVIt's a whole new way of doing things, which includes new downsides.
p337
aVIn the United States right now, a woman named Judith Miller
p338
aVis in jail for not having given to a Federal Grand Jury her sources \u2014
p339
aVshe's a reporter for the New York Times \u2014
p340
aVher sources, in a very abstract and hard-to-follow case.
p341
aVAnd journalists are in the street rallying to improve the shield laws.
p342
aVThe shield laws are our laws \u2014 pretty much a patchwork of state laws \u2014
p343
aVthat prevent a journalist from having to betray a source.
p344
aVThis is happening, however, against the background
p345
aVof the rise of Web logging.
p346
aVWeb logging is a classic example of mass amateurization.
p347
aVIt has de-professionalized publishing.
p348
aVWant to publish globally anything you think today?
p349
aVIt is a one-button operation that you can do for free.
p350
aVThat has sent the professional class of publishing down
p351
aVinto the ranks of mass amateurization.
p352
aVAnd so the shield law, as much as we want it \u2014
p353
aVwe want a professional class of truth-tellers \u2014
p354
aVit is becoming increasingly incoherent, because
p355
aVthe institution is becoming incoherent.
p356
aVThere are people in the States right now
p357
aVtying themselves into knots, trying to figure out
p358
aVwhether or not bloggers are journalists.
p359
aVAnd the answer to that question is,
p360
aVit doesn't matter, because that's not the right question.
p361
aVJournalism was an answer to an even more important question,
p362
aVwhich is, how will society be informed?
p363
aVHow will they share ideas and opinions?
p364
aVAnd if there is an answer to that that happens outside
p365
aVthe professional framework of journalism,
p366
aVit makes no sense to take a professional metaphor
p367
aVand apply it to this distributed class.
p368
aVSo as much as we want the shield laws,
p369
aVthe background \u2014 the institution to which they were attached \u2014
p370
aVis becoming incoherent.
p371
aa(lp372
VHere's another example.
p373
aVPro-ana, the pro-ana groups.
p374
aVThese are groups of teenage girls
p375
aVwho have taken on Web logs, bulletin boards,
p376
aVother kinds of cooperative infrastructure,
p377
aVand have used it to set up support groups for
p378
aVremaining anorexic by choice.
p379
aVThey post pictures of thin models, which they call "thinspiration."
p380
aVThey have little slogans, like "Salvation through Starvation."
p381
aVThey even have Lance Armstrong-style bracelets,
p382
aVthese red bracelets, which signify, in the small group,
p383
aVI am trying to maintain my eating disorder.
p384
aVThey trade tips, like, if you feel like eating something,
p385
aVclean a toilet or the litter box. The feeling will pass.
p386
aa(lp387
VWe're used to support groups being beneficial.
p388
aVWe have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial.
p389
aVBut it turns out that the logic of the support group is value neutral.
p390
aVA support group is simply a small group that wants to maintain
p391
aVa way of living in the context of a larger group.
p392
aVNow, when the larger group is a bunch of drunks,
p393
aVand the small group wants to stay sober, then we think,
p394
aVthat's a great support group.
p395
aVBut when the small group is teenage girls
p396
aVwho want to stay anorexic by choice, then we're horrified.
p397
aVWhat's happened is that the normative goals
p398
aVof the support groups that we're used to,
p399
aVcame from the institutions that were framing them,
p400
aVand not from the infrastructure.
p401
aVOnce the infrastructure becomes generically available,
p402
aVthe logic of the support group has been revealed to be
p403
aVaccessible to anyone, including people pursuing these kinds of goals.
p404
aa(lp405
VSo, there are significant downsides to these changes
p406
aVas well as upsides. And of course, in the current environment,
p407
aVone need allude only lightly to the work of non-state actors
p408
aVtrying to influence global affairs, and taking advantage of these.
p409
aVThis is a social map of the hijackers and their associates
p410
aVwho perpetrated the 9/11 attack.
p411
aVIt was produced by analyzing their communications patterns
p412
aVusing a lot of these tools. And doubtless the intelligence communities of the world
p413
aVare doing the same work today for the attacks of last week.
p414
aa(lp415
VNow, this is the part of the talk where I tell you
p416
aVwhat's going to come as a result of all of this,
p417
aVbut I'm running out of time, which is good,
p418
aVbecause I don't know.
p419

aVRight. As with the printing press, if it's really a revolution,
p421
aVit doesn't take us from Point A to Point B.
p422
aVIt takes us from Point A to chaos.
p423
aVThe printing press precipitated 200 years of chaos,
p424
aVmoving from a world where the Catholic Church
p425
aVwas the sort of organizing political force to the Treaty of Westphalia,
p426
aVwhen we finally knew what the new unit was: the nation state.
p427
aa(lp428
VNow, I'm not predicting 200 years of chaos as a result of this. 50.
p429
aV50 years in which loosely coordinated groups
p430
aVare going to be given increasingly high leverage,
p431
aVand the more those groups forego traditional institutional imperatives \u2014
p432
aVlike deciding in advance what's going to happen,
p433
aVor the profit motive \u2014 the more leverage they'll get.
p434
aVAnd institutions are going to come under
p435
aVan increasing degree of pressure,
p436
aVand the more rigidly managed, and the more they rely
p437
aVon information monopolies, the greater the pressure is going to be.
p438
aVAnd that's going to happen one arena at a time,
p439
aVone institution at a time. The forces are general,
p440
aVbut the results are going to be specific.
p441
aa(lp442
VAnd so the point here is not,
p443
aV"This is wonderful," or "We're going to see a transition
p444
aVfrom only institutions to only cooperative framework."
p445
aVIt's going to be much more complicated than that.
p446
aVBut the point is that it's going to be a massive readjustment.
p447
aVAnd since we can see it in advance and know it's coming,
p448
aVmy argument is essentially: we might as well get good at it.
p449
aVThank you very much.
