VHi. My name is Cameron Russell,
p4
aVand for the last little while, I've been a model.
p5
aVActually, for 10 years.
p6
aVAnd I feel like
p7
aVthere's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now
p8
aVbecause I should not have worn this dress.
p9
aa(lp10
V(Laughter)
p11
aa(lp12
VSo luckily, I brought an outfit change.
p13
aVThis is the first outfit change on the TED stage,
p14
aVso you guys are pretty lucky to witness it, I think.
p15
aVIf some of the women were really horrified when I came out,
p16
aVyou don't have to tell me now, but I'll find out later on Twitter.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VI'd also note that I'm quite privileged
p21
aVto be able to transform what you think of me
p22
aVin a very brief 10 seconds.
p23
aVNot everybody gets to do that.
p24
aVThese heels are very uncomfortable, so good thing I wasn't going to wear them.
p25
aVThe worst part is putting this sweater over my head,
p26
aVbecause that's when you'll all laugh at me,
p27
aVso don't do anything while it's over my head.
p28
aVAll right.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo, why did I do that?
p31
aVThat was awkward.
p32
aa(lp33
V(Laughter)
p34
aa(lp35
VWell \u2014
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VHopefully not as awkward as that picture.
p40
aVImage is powerful,
p41
aVbut also, image is superficial.
p42
aVI just totally transformed what you thought of me, in six seconds.
p43
aVAnd in this picture,
p44
aVI had actually never had a boyfriend in real life.
p45
aVI was totally uncomfortable,
p46
aVand the photographer was telling me to arch my back
p47
aVand put my hand in that guy's hair.
p48
aVAnd of course, barring surgery,
p49
aVor the fake tan that I got two days ago for work,
p50
aVthere's very little that we can do to transform how we look,
p51
aVand how we look, though it is superficial and immutable,
p52
aVhas a huge impact on our lives.
p53
aa(lp54
VSo today, for me, being fearless means being honest.
p55
aVAnd I am on this stage because I am a model.
p56
aVI am on this stage because I am a pretty, white woman,
p57
aVand in my industry, we call that a sexy girl.
p58
aVI'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me,
p59
aVbut with an honest twist.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo the first question is, how do you become a model?
p62
aVI always just say, "Oh, I was scouted,"
p63
aVbut that means nothing.
p64
aVThe real way that I became a model
p65
aVis I won a genetic lottery, and I am the recipient of a legacy,
p66
aVand maybe you're wondering what is a legacy.
p67
aVWell, for the past few centuries
p68
aVwe have defined beauty not just as health and youth
p69
aVand symmetry that we're biologically programmed to admire,
p70
aVbut also as tall, slender figures,
p71
aVand femininity and white skin.
p72
aVAnd this is a legacy that was built for me,
p73
aVand it's a legacy that I've been cashing out on.
p74
aVAnd I know there are people in the audience
p75
aVwho are skeptical at this point,
p76
aVand maybe there are some fashionistas who are like,
p77
aV"Wait. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu Wen."
p78
aVAnd first, I commend you on your model knowledge. Very impressive.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Laughter)
p81
aa(lp82
VBut unfortunately, I have to inform you that in 2007,
p83
aVa very inspired NYU Ph.D. student
p84
aVcounted all the models on the runway, every single one that was hired,
p85
aVand of the 677 models that were hired,
p86
aVonly 27, or less than four percent, were non-white.
p87
aa(lp88
VThe next question people always ask is,
p89
aV"Can I be a model when I grow up?"
p90
aVAnd the first answer is, "I don't know, they don't put me in charge of that."
p91
aVBut the second answer,
p92
aVand what I really want to say to these little girls is,
p93
aV"Why? You know? You can be anything.
p94
aVYou could be the President of the United States,
p95
aVor the inventor of the next Internet,
p96
aVor a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet,
p97
aVwhich would be awesome, because you'd be the first one."
p98
aa(lp99
V(Laughter)
p100
aa(lp101
VIf, after this amazing list, they still are like,
p102
aV"No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model,"
p103
aVwell, then I say, "Be my boss."
p104
aVBecause I'm not in charge of anything,
p105
aVand you could be the editor in chief of American Vogue
p106
aVor the CEO of H&M, or the next Steven Meisel.
p107
aVSaying that you want to be a model when you grow up
p108
aVis akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up.
p109
aVIt's out of your control, and it's awesome,
p110
aVand it's not a career path.
p111
aa(lp112
VI will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge,
p113
aVbecause unlike cardiothoracic surgeons,
p114
aVit can just be distilled right now.
p115
aVSo, if the photographer is right there,
p116
aVthe light is right there, like a nice HMI,
p117
aVand the client says, "We want a walking shot,"
p118
aVthis leg goes first, nice and long, this arm goes back, this arm goes forward,
p119
aVthe head is at three quarters, and you just go back and forth,
p120
aVjust do that, and then you look back at your imaginary friends,
p121
aV300, 400, 500 times.
p122
aa(lp123
V(Laughter)
p124
aa(lp125
VIt will look something like this.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VHopefully less awkward than that one in the middle.
p130
aVThat was \u2014 I don't know what happened there.
p131
aa(lp132
VUnfortunately, after you've gone to school,
p133
aVand you have a résumé and you've done a few jobs,
p134
aVyou can't say anything anymore,
p135
aVso if you say you want to be the President of the United States,
p136
aVbut your résumé reads, "Underwear Model: 10 years,"
p137
aVpeople give you a funny look.
p138
aa(lp139
VThe next question is, "Do they retouch all the photos?"
p140
aVAnd yeah, they pretty much retouch all the photos,
p141
aVbut that is only a small component of what's happening.
p142
aVThis picture is the very first picture that I ever took,
p143
aVand it's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini,
p144
aVand I didn't even have my period yet.
p145
aVI know we're getting personal, but I was a young girl.
p146
aVThis is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier.
p147
aVHere's me on the same day as this shoot.
p148
aVMy friend got to come.
p149
aVHere's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue.
p150
aVHere's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine.
p151
aVAnd here's me today.
p152
aVAnd I hope what you're seeing
p153
aVis that these pictures are not pictures of me.
p154
aVThey are constructions,
p155
aVand they are constructions by a group of professionals,
p156
aVby hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists
p157
aVand all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production,
p158
aVand they build this.
p159
aVThat's not me.
p160
aa(lp161
VOkay, so the next question people always ask me is,
p162
aV"Do you get free stuff?"
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VI do have too many 8-inch heels which I never get to wear,
p167
aVexcept for earlier,
p168
aVbut the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life,
p169
aVand that's what we don't like to talk about.
p170
aa(lp171
VI grew up in Cambridge,
p172
aVand one time I went into a store and I forgot my money
p173
aVand they gave me the dress for free.
p174
aVWhen I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend
p175
aVwho was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course,
p176
aVwe got pulled over,
p177
aVand all it took was a "Sorry, officer," and we were on our way.
p178
aVAnd I got these free things because of how I look,
p179
aVnot who I am, and there are people paying a cost
p180
aVfor how they look and not who they are.
p181
aa(lp182
VI live in New York, and last year,
p183
aVof the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked,
p184
aV86% of them were black and Latino, and most of them were young men.
p185
aVAnd there are only 177,000 young black and Latino men in New York,
p186
aVso for them, it's not a question of, "Will I get stopped?"
p187
aVbut "How many times will I get stopped? When will I get stopped?"
p188
aVWhen I was researching this talk,
p189
aVI found out that of the 13-year-old girls in the United States,
p190
aV53% don't like their bodies,
p191
aVand that number goes to 78% by the time that they're 17.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo, the last question people ask me is,
p194
aV"What is it like to be a model?"
p195
aVAnd I think the answer that they're looking for is,
p196
aV"If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair,
p197
aVyou will be so happy and fabulous."
p198
aVAnd when we're backstage,
p199
aVwe give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that.
p200
aVWe say, "It's really amazing to travel, and it's amazing to get to work
p201
aVwith creative, inspired, passionate people."
p202
aVAnd those things are true, but they're only one half of the story,
p203
aVbecause the thing that we never say on camera,
p204
aVthat I have never said on camera, is,
p205
aV"I am insecure."
p206
aVAnd I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day.
p207
aVAnd if you ever are wondering,
p208
aV"If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair, will I be happier?"
p209
aVyou just need to meet a group of models,
p210
aVbecause they have the thinnest thighs, the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes,
p211
aVand they're the most physically insecure women probably on the planet.
p212
aa(lp213
VWhen I was writing this talk,
p214
aVI found it very difficult to strike an honest balance,
p215
aVbecause on the one hand,
p216
aVI felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say,
p217
aV"Look I've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor,"
p218
aVand it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with,
p219
aV"and it doesn't always make me happy."
p220
aVBut mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression
p221
aVwhen I am one of the biggest beneficiaries.
p222
aa(lp223
VBut I'm also happy and honored to be up here
p224
aVand I think that it's great that I got to come
p225
aVbefore 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career,
p226
aVbecause maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job,
p227
aVor maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college,
p228
aVwhich seems so important right now.
p229
aa(lp230
VIf there's a takeaway to this talk,
p231
aVI hope it's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging
p232
aVthe power of image in our perceived successes
p233
aVand our perceived failures.
p234
aa(lp235
VThank you.
