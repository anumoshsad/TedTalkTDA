p4
aVFor any of you who have visited or lived in New York City,
p5
aVthese shots might start to look familiar.
p6
aVThis is Central Park,
p7
aVone of the most beautifully designed
p8
aVpublic spaces in America.
p9
aVBut to anyone who hasn't visited,
p10
aVthese images can't really fully convey.
p11
aVTo really understand Central Park,
p12
aVyou have to physically be there.
p13
aVWell, the same is true of the music,
p14
aVwhich my brother and I composed and mapped
p15
aVspecifically for Central Park.
p16
aV(Music)
p17
aa(lp18
VI'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work
p19
aVthat my brother Hays and I are doing \u2014
p20
aVThat's us there. That's both of us actually \u2014
p21
aVspecifically about a concept that we've been developing over the last few years,
p22
aVthis idea of location-aware music.
p23
aa(lp24
VNow, my brother and I, we're musicians
p25
aVand music producers.
p26
aVWe've been working together since,
p27
aVwell, since we were kids, really.
p28
aVBut recently, we've become more and more interested
p29
aVin projects where art
p30
aVand technology intersect,
p31
aVfrom creating sight-specific audio
p32
aVand video installation
p33
aVto engineering interactive concerts.
p34
aa(lp35
VBut today I want to focus on this concept
p36
aVof composition for physical space.
p37
aa(lp38
VBut before I go too much further into that,
p39
aVlet me tell you a little bit about how we got started
p40
aVwith this idea.
p41
aVMy brother and I were living in New York City
p42
aVwhen the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude
p43
aVdid their temporary installation, The Gates,
p44
aVin Central Park.
p45
aVHundreds of these brightly-colored sculptures
p46
aVdecorated the park for a number of weeks,
p47
aVand unlike work that's exhibited
p48
aVin a more neutral space,
p49
aVlike on the walls of a gallery or a museum,
p50
aVthis was work that was really in dialogue
p51
aVwith this place,
p52
aVand in a lot of ways, The Gates
p53
aVwas really a celebration
p54
aVof Frederick Olmsted's incredible design.
p55
aVThis was an experience that stayed with us
p56
aVfor a long time, and years later,
p57
aVmy brother and I moved back to Washington, D.C.,
p58
aVand we started to ask the question,
p59
aVwould it be possible,
p60
aVin the same way that The Gates
p61
aVresponded to the physical layout of the park,
p62
aVto compose music for a landscape?
p63
aVWhich brought us to this.
p64
aa(lp65
V(Music)
p66
aa(lp67
VOn Memorial Day, we released "The National Mall,"
p68
aVa location-aware album
p69
aVreleased exclusively as a mobile app
p70
aVthat uses the device's built-in GPS functionality
p71
aVto sonically map the entire park
p72
aVin our hometown of Washington, D.C.
p73
aVHundreds of musical segments
p74
aVare geo-tagged throughout the entire park
p75
aVso that as a listener traverses the landscape,
p76
aVa musical score is actually unfolding around them.
p77
aVSo this is not a playlist or a list of songs
p78
aVintended for the park,
p79
aVbut rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythms
p80
aVthat fit together like pieces of a puzzle
p81
aVand blend seamlessly
p82
aVbased on a listener's chosen trajectory.
p83
aVSo think of this as
p84
aVa choose-your-own-adventure of an album.
p85
aa(lp86
VLet's take a closer look.
p87
aVLet's look at one example here.
p88
aVSo using the app,
p89
aVas you make your way towards the grounds
p90
aVsurrounding the Washington Monument,
p91
aVyou hear the sounds of instruments warming up,
p92
aVwhich then gives way to the sound of a mellotron
p93
aVspelling out a very simple melody.
p94
aVThis is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins.
p95
aVKeep walking, and a full choir joins in,
p96
aVuntil you finally reach the top of the hill
p97
aVand you're hearing the sound of drums and fireworks
p98
aVand all sorts of musical craziness,
p99
aVas if all of these sounds are radiating out
p100
aVfrom this giant obelisk that punctuates
p101
aVthe center of the park.
p102
aVBut were you to walk in the opposite direction,
p103
aVthis entire sequence happens in reverse.
p104
aVAnd were you to actually exit the perimeter of the park,
p105
aVthe music would fade to silence,
p106
aVand the play button would disappear.
p107
aa(lp108
VWe're sometimes contacted by  people in other parts of the world
p109
aVwho can't travel to the United States,
p110
aVbut would like to hear this record.
p111
aVWell, unlike a normal album,
p112
aVwe haven't been able to accommodate this request.
p113
aVWhen they ask for a C.D. or an MP3 version,
p114
aVwe just can't make that happen,
p115
aVand the reason is because
p116
aVthis isn't a promotional app
p117
aVor a game to promote or accompany
p118
aVthe release of a traditional record.
p119
aVIn this case, the app is the work itself,
p120
aVand the architecture of the landscape
p121
aVis intrinsic to the listening experience.
p122
aa(lp123
VSix months later, we did a location-aware album
p124
aVfor Central Park,
p125
aVa park that is over two times the size of the National Mall,
p126
aVwith music spanning from the Sheep's Meadow
p127
aVto the Ramble to the Reservoir.
p128
aa(lp129
VCurrently, my brother and I are working on
p130
aVprojects all over the country,
p131
aVbut last spring we started a project,
p132
aVhere actually at Stanford's
p133
aVExperimental Media Art Department,
p134
aVwhere we're creating our largest location-aware album to date,
p135
aVone that will span the entirety of Highway 1
p136
aVhere on the Pacific Coast.
p137
aa(lp138
VBut what we're doing, integrating GPS with music,
p139
aVis really just one idea.
p140
aVBut it speaks to a larger vision
p141
aVfor a music industry that's sometimes struggled
p142
aVto find its footing in this digital age,
p143
aVthat they begin to see these new technologies
p144
aVnot simply as ways of adding bells and whistles
p145
aVto an existing model,
p146
aVbut to dream up entirely new ways
p147
aVfor people to interact with
p148
aVand experience music.
