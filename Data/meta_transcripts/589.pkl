VI'll start with my favorite muse, Emily Dickinson,
p4
aVwho said that wonder is not knowledge, neither is it ignorance.
p5
aVIt's something which is suspended
p6
aVbetween what we believe we can be,
p7
aVand a tradition we may have forgotten.
p8
aVAnd I think, when I listen to these incredible people here,
p9
aVI've been so inspired \u2014 so many incredible ideas, so many visions.
p10
aVAnd yet, when I look at the environment outside,
p11
aVyou see how resistant architecture is to change.
p12
aVYou see how resistant it is to those very ideas.
p13
aVWe can think them out. We can create incredible things.
p14
aVAnd yet, at the end,
p15
aVit's so hard to change a wall.
p16
aVWe applaud the well-mannered box.
p17
aVBut to create a space that never existed is what interests me;
p18
aVto create something that has never been,
p19
aVa space that we have never entered except in our minds and our spirits.
p20
aVAnd I think that's really what architecture is based on.
p21
aa(lp22
VArchitecture is not based on concrete
p23
aVand steel and the elements of the soil.
p24
aVIt's based on wonder.
p25
aVAnd that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities,
p26
aVthe greatest spaces that we have had.
p27
aVAnd I think that is indeed what architecture is. It is a story.
p28
aVBy the way, it is a story that is told through
p29
aVits hard materials.
p30
aVBut it is a story of effort and struggle
p31
aVagainst improbabilities.
p32
aVIf you think of the great buildings, of the cathedrals, of the temples,
p33
aVof the pyramids, of pagodas,
p34
aVof cities in India and beyond,
p35
aVyou think of how incredible this is that that was realized
p36
aVnot by some abstract idea, but by people.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo, anything that has been made can be unmade.
p39
aVAnything that has been made can be made better.
p40
aVThere it is: the things that I really believe
p41
aVare of important architecture.
p42
aVThese are the dimensions that I like to work with.
p43
aVIt's something very personal.
p44
aVIt's not, perhaps, the dimensions appreciated by art critics
p45
aVor architecture critics or city planners.
p46
aVBut I think these are the necessary oxygen
p47
aVfor us to live in buildings, to live in cities,
p48
aVto connect ourselves in a social space.
p49
aa(lp50
VAnd I therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward.
p51
aVIt's the only profession where you have to believe in the future.
p52
aVYou can be a general, a politician, an economist who is depressed,
p53
aVa musician in a minor key, a painter in dark colors.
p54
aVBut architecture is that complete ecstasy that the future can be better.
p55
aVAnd it is that belief that I think drives society.
p56
aa(lp57
VAnd today we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us.
p58
aVAnd yet it is in times like this
p59
aVthat I think architecture can thrive with big ideas,
p60
aVideas that are not small. Think of the great cities.
p61
aVThink of the Empire State Building, the Rockefeller Center.
p62
aVThey were built in times that were
p63
aVnot really the best of times in a certain way.
p64
aVAnd yet that energy and power of architecture
p65
aVhas driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo again, I am a believer in the expressive.
p68
aVI have never been a fan of the neutral.
p69
aVI don't like neutrality in life, in anything.
p70
aVI think expression.
p71
aVAnd it's like espresso coffee, you know, you take the essence of the coffee.
p72
aVThat's what expression is.
p73
aVIt's been missing in much of the architecture,
p74
aVbecause we think architecture is the realm of the neutered,
p75
aVthe realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion,
p76
aVthat has no value.
p77
aVAnd yet, I believe it is the expression \u2014
p78
aVexpression of the city, expression of our own space \u2014
p79
aVthat gives meaning to architecture.
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd, of course, expressive spaces are not mute.
p82
aVExpressive spaces are not spaces
p83
aVthat simply confirm what we already know.
p84
aVExpressive spaces may disturb us.
p85
aVAnd I think that's also part of life.
p86
aVLife is not just an anesthetic to make us smile,
p87
aVbut to reach out across the abyss of history,
p88
aVto places we have never been,
p89
aVand would have perhaps been, had we not been so lucky.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo again, radical versus conservative.
p92
aVRadical, what does it mean? It's something which is rooted,
p93
aVand something which is rooted deep in a tradition.
p94
aVAnd I think that is what architecture is, it's radical.
p95
aVIt's not just a conservation in formaldehyde
p96
aVof dead forms.
p97
aVIt is actually a living connection
p98
aVto the cosmic event that we are part of,
p99
aVand a story that is certainly ongoing.
p100
aVIt's not something that has a good ending or a bad ending.
p101
aVIt's actually a story in which our acts themselves
p102
aVare pushing the story in a particular way.
p103
aa(lp104
VSo again I am a believer in the radical architecture.
p105
aVYou know the Soviet architecture of that building
p106
aVis the conservation.
p107
aVIt's like the old Las Vegas used to be.
p108
aVIt's about conserving emotions, conserving the traditions
p109
aVthat have obstructed the mind in moving forward
p110
aVand of course what is radical is to confront them.
p111
aVAnd I think our architecture is a confrontation
p112
aVwith our own senses.
p113
aVTherefore I believe it should not be cool.
p114
aa(lp115
VThere is a lot of appreciation for the kind of cool architecture.
p116
aVI've always been an opponent of it. I think emotion is needed.
p117
aVLife without emotion would really not be life.
p118
aVEven the mind is emotional.
p119
aVThere is no reason which does not take a position
p120
aVin the ethical sphere, in the philosophical mystery of what we are.
p121
aVSo I think emotion is a dimension
p122
aVthat is important to introduce into city space, into city life.
p123
aa(lp124
VAnd of course, we are all about the struggle of emotions.
p125
aVAnd I think that is what makes the world a wondrous place.
p126
aVAnd of course, the confrontation of the cool, the unemotional with emotion,
p127
aVis a conversation that I think
p128
aVcities themselves have fostered.
p129
aVI think that is the progress of cities.
p130
aVIt's not only the forms of cities,
p131
aVbut the fact that they incarnate emotions,
p132
aVnot just of those who build them,
p133
aVbut of those who live there as well.
p134
aa(lp135
VInexplicable versus understood. You know, too often we want to understand everything.
p136
aVBut architecture is not the language of words.
p137
aVIt's a language. But it is not a language that can be reduced
p138
aVto a series of programmatic notes that we can verbally write.
p139
aVToo many buildings that you see outside that are so banal
p140
aVtell you a story, but the story is very short,
p141
aVwhich says, "We have no story to tell you."
p142
aV(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VSo the important thing actually,
p145
aVis to introduce the actual architectural dimensions,
p146
aVwhich might be totally inexplicable in words,
p147
aVbecause they operate in proportions,
p148
aVin materials, in light.
p149
aVThey connect themselves into various sources,
p150
aVinto a kind of complex vector matrix
p151
aVthat isn't really frontal
p152
aVbut is really embedded in the lives,
p153
aVand in the history of a city, and of a people.
p154
aVSo again, the notion that a building should just be explicit
p155
aVI think is a false notion,
p156
aVwhich has reduced architecture into banality.
p157
aa(lp158
VHand versus the computer.
p159
aVOf course, what would we be without computers?
p160
aVOur whole practice depends on computing.
p161
aVBut the computer should not just be the glove of the hand;
p162
aVthe hand should really be the driver of the computing power.
p163
aVBecause I believe that the hand
p164
aVin all its primitive, in all its physiological obscurity,
p165
aVhas a source, though the source is unknown,
p166
aVthough we don't have to be mystical about it.
p167
aVWe realize that the hand has been given us
p168
aVby forces that are beyond our own autonomy.
p169
aVAnd I think when I draw drawings
p170
aVwhich may imitate the computer, but are not computer drawings \u2014
p171
aVdrawings that can come from sources
p172
aVthat are completely not known, not normal, not seen,
p173
aVyet the hand \u2014 and that's what I really, to all of you who are working \u2014
p174
aVhow can we make the computer respond to our hand
p175
aVrather than the hand responding to the computer.
p176
aa(lp177
VI think that's part of what the complexity of architecture is.
p178
aVBecause certainly we have gotten used to the propaganda
p179
aVthat the simple is the good. But I don't believe it.
p180
aVListening to all of you, the complexity of thought,
p181
aVthe complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming.
p182
aVAnd I think we shouldn't shy away in architecture,
p183
aVYou know, brain surgery, atomic theory,
p184
aVgenetics, economics
p185
aVare complex complex fields.
p186
aVThere is no reason that architecture should shy away
p187
aVand present this illusory world of the simple.
p188
aVIt is complex. Space is complex.
p189
aVSpace is something that folds out of itself into completely new worlds.
p190
aVAnd as wondrous as it is,
p191
aVit cannot be reduced to a kind of simplification
p192
aVthat we have often come to be admired.
p193
aVAnd yet, our lives are complex.
p194
aVOur emotions are complex.
p195
aVOur intellectual desires are complex.
p196
aVSo I do believe that architecture as I see it
p197
aVneeds to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have,
p198
aVin every intimacy that we possess.
p199
aa(lp200
VOf course that means that architecture is political.
p201
aVThe political is not an enemy of architecture.
p202
aVThe politeama is the city. It's all of us together.
p203
aVAnd I've always believed that the act of architecture,
p204
aVeven a private house, when somebody else will see it, is a political act,
p205
aVbecause it will be visible to others.
p206
aVAnd we live in a world which is connecting us more and more.
p207
aVSo again, the evasion of that sphere,
p208
aVwhich has been so endemic to that sort of pure architecture,
p209
aVthe autonomous architecture that is just an abstract object
p210
aVhas never appealed to me.
p211
aVAnd I do believe that this interaction
p212
aVwith the history, with history that is often very difficult,
p213
aVto grapple with it, to create
p214
aVa position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique.
p215
aa(lp216
VBecause architecture is also the asking of questions.
p217
aVIt's not only the giving of answers.
p218
aVIt's also, just like life, the asking of questions.
p219
aVTherefore it is important that it be real.
p220
aVYou know we can simulate almost anything.
p221
aVBut the one thing that can be ever simulated
p222
aVis the human heart, the human soul.
p223
aVAnd architecture is so closely intertwined with it
p224
aVbecause we are born somewhere and we die somewhere.
p225
aVSo the reality of architecture is visceral. It's not intellectual.
p226
aVIt's not something that comes to us from books and theories.
p227
aVIt's the real that we touch \u2014 the door, the window,
p228
aVthe threshold, the bed \u2014
p229
aVsuch prosaic objects. And yet,
p230
aVI try, in every building, to take that virtual world,
p231
aVwhich is so enigmatic and so rich,
p232
aVand create something in the real world.
p233
aVCreate a space for an office,
p234
aVa space of sustainability
p235
aVthat really works between that virtuality
p236
aVand yet can be realized as something real.
p237
aa(lp238
VUnexpected versus habitual.
p239
aVWhat is a habit? It's just a shackle for ourselves.
p240
aVIt's a self-induced poison.
p241
aVSo the unexpected is always unexpected.
p242
aVYou know, it's true, the cathedrals, as unexpected,
p243
aVwill always be unexpected.
p244
aVYou know Frank Gehry's buildings, they will continue to be unexpected in the future.
p245
aVSo not the habitual architecture that instills in us
p246
aVthe false sort of stability,
p247
aVbut an architecture that is full of tension,
p248
aVan architecture that goes beyond itself
p249
aVto reach a human soul and a human heart,
p250
aVand that breaks out of the shackles of habits.
p251
aa(lp252
VAnd of course habits are enforced by architecture.
p253
aVWhen we see the same kind of architecture
p254
aVwe become immured in that world of those angles,
p255
aVof those lights, of those materials.
p256
aVWe think the world really looks like our buildings.
p257
aVAnd yet our buildings are pretty much limited by the techniques and wonders
p258
aVthat have been part of them.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo again, the unexpected which is also the raw.
p261
aVAnd I often think of the raw and the refined.
p262
aVWhat is raw? The raw, I would say
p263
aVis the naked experience, untouched by luxury,
p264
aVuntouched by expensive materials,
p265
aVuntouched by the kind of refinement
p266
aVthat we associate with high culture.
p267
aVSo the rawness, I think, in space,
p268
aVthe fact that sustainability can actually, in the future
p269
aVtranslate into a raw space,
p270
aVa space that isn't decorated,
p271
aVa space that is not mannered in any source,
p272
aVbut a space that might be cool in terms of its temperature,
p273
aVmight be refractive to our desires.
p274
aVA space that doesn't always follow us
p275
aVlike a dog that has been trained to follow us,
p276
aVbut moves ahead into directions of demonstrating
p277
aVother possibilities, other experiences,
p278
aVthat have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture.
p279
aa(lp280
VAnd of course that juxtaposition is of great interest to me
p281
aVbecause it creates a kind of a spark of new energy.
p282
aVAnd so I do like something which is pointed, not blunt,
p283
aVsomething which is focused on reality,
p284
aVsomething that has the power, through its leverage,
p285
aVto transform even a very small space.
p286
aa(lp287
VSo architecture maybe is not so big, like science,
p288
aVbut through its focal point
p289
aVit can leverage in an Archimedian way
p290
aVwhat we think the world is really about.
p291
aVAnd often it takes just a building
p292
aVto change our experience of what could be done, what has been done,
p293
aVhow the world has remained both in between stability and instability.
p294
aVAnd of course buildings have their shapes.
p295
aVThose shapes are difficult to change.
p296
aVAnd yet, I do believe that in every social space,
p297
aVin every public space,
p298
aVthere is a desire to communicate more
p299
aVthan just that blunt thought, that blunt technique,
p300
aVbut something that pinpoints, and can point in various directions
p301
aVforward, backward, sideways and around.
p302
aVSo that is indeed what is memory.
p303
aVSo I believe that my main interest is to memory.
p304
aVWithout memory we would be amnesiacs.
p305
aVWe would not know which way we were going,
p306
aVand why we are going where we're going.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo I've been never interested in the forgettable reuse,
p309
aVrehashing of the same things over and over again,
p310
aVwhich, of course, get accolades of critics.
p311
aVCritics like the performance to be repeated again and again the same way.
p312
aVBut I rather play something
p313
aVcompletely unheard of,
p314
aVand even with flaws,
p315
aVthan repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed
p316
aVby its meaninglessness.
p317
aVSo again, memory is the city, memory is the world.
p318
aVWithout the memory there would be no story to tell.
p319
aVThere would be nowhere to turn.
p320
aa(lp321
VThe memorable, I think, is really our world, what we think the world is.
p322
aVAnd it's not only our memory,
p323
aVbut those who remember us,
p324
aVwhich means that architecture is not mute.
p325
aVIt's an art of communication.
p326
aVIt tells a story. The story can reach into obscure desires.
p327
aVIt can reach into sources that are not explicitly available.
p328
aVIt can reach into millennia
p329
aVthat have been buried,
p330
aVand return them in a just and unexpected equity.
p331
aa(lp332
VSo again, I think the notion that
p333
aVthe best architecture is silent has never appealed to me.
p334
aVSilence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city.
p335
aVCities should be full of vibrations, full of sound, full of music.
p336
aVAnd that indeed is the architectural mission
p337
aVthat I believe is important,
p338
aVis to create spaces that are vibrant,
p339
aVthat are pluralistic,
p340
aVthat can transform the most prosaic activities,
p341
aVand raise them to a completely different expectation.
p342
aVCreate a shopping center, a swimming place
p343
aVthat is more like a museum than like entertainment.
p344
aVAnd these are our dreams.
p345
aa(lp346
VAnd of course risk. I think architecture should be risky.
p347
aVYou know it costs a lot of money and so on, but yes,
p348
aVit should not play it safe.
p349
aVIt should not play it safe, because if it plays it safe
p350
aVit's not moving us in a direction that we want to be.
p351
aVAnd I think, of course,
p352
aVrisk is what underlies the world.
p353
aVWorld without risk would not be worth living.
p354
aVSo yes, I do believe that the risk we take in every building.
p355
aVRisks to create spaces that have never been cantilevered to that extent.
p356
aVRisks of spaces that have never been
p357
aVso dizzying,
p358
aVas they should be, for a pioneering city.
p359
aVRisks that really move architecture
p360
aVeven with all its flaws, into a space which is much better
p361
aVthat the ever again repeated
p362
aVhollowness of a ready-made thing.
p363
aa(lp364
VAnd of course that is finally what I believe architecture to be.
p365
aVIt's about space. It's not about fashion.
p366
aVIt's not about decoration.
p367
aVIt's about creating with minimal means
p368
aVsomething which can not be repeated,
p369
aVcannot be simulated in any other sphere.
p370
aVAnd there of course is the space that we need to breathe,
p371
aVis the space we need to dream.
p372
aVThese are the spaces that are
p373
aVnot just luxurious spaces for some of us,
p374
aVbut are important for everybody in this world.
p375
aa(lp376
VSo again, it's not about the changing fashions, changing theories.
p377
aVIt's about carving out a space for trees.
p378
aVIt's carving out a space where nature can enter
p379
aVthe domestic world of a city.
p380
aVA space where something which has never seen a light of day
p381
aVcan enter into the inner workings of a density.
p382
aVAnd I think that is really the nature of architecture.
p383
aa(lp384
VNow I am a believer in democracy.
p385
aVI don't like beautiful buildings
p386
aVbuilt for totalitarian regimes.
p387
aVWhere people cannot speak, cannot vote, cannot do anything.
p388
aVWe too often admire those buildings. We think they are beautiful.
p389
aVAnd yet when I think of the poverty of society
p390
aVwhich doesn't give freedom to its people,
p391
aVI don't admire those buildings.
p392
aVSo democracy, as difficult as it is, I believe in it.
p393
aa(lp394
VAnd of course, at Ground Zero what else?
p395
aVIt's such a complex project.
p396
aVIt's emotional. There is so many interests.
p397
aVIt's political. There is so many parties to this project.
p398
aVThere is so many interests. There's money. There's political power.
p399
aVThere are emotions of the victims.
p400
aVAnd yet, in all its messiness, in all its difficulties,
p401
aVI would not have liked somebody to say,
p402
aV"This is the tabula rasa, mister architect \u2014 do whatever you want."
p403
aVI think nothing good will come out of that.
p404
aa(lp405
VI think architecture is about consensus.
p406
aVAnd it is about the dirty word "compromise." Compromise is not bad.
p407
aVCompromise, if it's artistic,
p408
aVif it is able to cope with its strategies \u2014
p409
aVand there is my first sketch and the last rendering \u2014
p410
aVit's not that far away.
p411
aVAnd yet, compromise, consensus,
p412
aVthat is what I believe in.
p413
aVAnd Ground Zero, despite all its difficulties, it's moving forward.
p414
aVIt's difficult. 2011, 2013. Freedom Tower, the memorial.
p415
aVAnd that is where I end.
p416
aa(lp417
VI was inspired when I came here as an immigrant
p418
aVon a ship like millions of others,
p419
aVlooking at America from that point of view.
p420
aVThis is America. This is liberty.
p421
aVThis is what we dream about. Its individuality,
p422
aVdemonstrated in the skyline. It's resilience.
p423
aVAnd finally, it's the freedom that America represents,
p424
aVnot just to me, as an immigrant, but to everyone in the world. Thank you.
p425
aa(lp426
V(Applause)
p427
aa(lp428
VChris Anderson: I've got a question.
p429
aVSo have you come to peace
p430
aVwith the process that happened at Ground Zero
p431
aVand the loss of the original, incredible design that you came up with?
p432
aa(lp433
VDaniel Libeskind: Look. We have to cure ourselves
p434
aVof the notion that we are authoritarian,
p435
aVthat we can determine everything that happens.
p436
aVWe have to rely on others, and shape the process in the best way possible.
p437
aVI came from the Bronx. I was taught not to be a loser,
p438
aVnot to be somebody who just gives up in a fight.
p439
aVYou have to fight for what you believe. You don't always win
p440
aVeverything you want to win. But you can steer the process.
