VWhat if I could present you a story
p4
aVthat you would remember with your entire body
p5
aVand not just with your mind?
p6
aVMy whole life as a journalist, I've really been compelled
p7
aVto try to make stories that can make a difference
p8
aVand maybe inspire people to care.
p9
aVI've worked in print. I've worked in documentary.
p10
aVI've worked in broadcast.
p11
aVBut it really wasn't until I got involved with virtual reality
p12
aVthat I started seeing these really intense,
p13
aVauthentic reactions from people
p14
aVthat really blew my mind.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo the deal is that with VR, virtual reality,
p17
aVI can put you on scene
p18
aVin the middle of the story.
p19
aVBy putting on these goggles that track wherever you look,
p20
aVyou get this whole-body sensation,
p21
aVlike you're actually, like, there.
p22
aVSo five years ago was about when I really began to push the envelope
p23
aVwith using virtual reality and journalism together.
p24
aVAnd I wanted to do a piece about hunger.
p25
aVFamilies in America are going hungry, food banks are overwhelmed,
p26
aVand they're often running out of food.
p27
aVNow, I knew I couldn't make people feel hungry,
p28
aVbut maybe I could figure out a way to get them to feel something physical.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo \u2014 again, this is five years ago \u2014
p31
aVso doing journalism and virtual reality together
p32
aVwas considered a worse-than-half-baked idea,
p33
aVand I had no funding.
p34
aVBelieve me, I had a lot of colleagues laughing at me.
p35
aVAnd I did, though, have a really great intern,
p36
aVa woman named Michaela Kobsa-Mark.
p37
aVAnd together we went out to food banks
p38
aVand started recording audio and photographs.
p39
aVUntil one day she came back to my office
p40
aVand she was bawling, she was just crying.
p41
aVShe had been on scene at a long line,
p42
aVwhere the woman running the line was feeling extremely overwhelmed,
p43
aVand she was screaming, "There's too many people!
p44
aVThere's too many people!"
p45
aVAnd this man with diabetes doesn't get food in time,
p46
aVhis blood sugar drops too low, and he collapses into a coma.
p47
aVAs soon as I heard that audio,
p48
aVI knew that this would be the kind of evocative piece
p49
aVthat could really describe what was going on at food banks.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo here's the real line. You can see how long it was, right?
p52
aVAnd again, as I said, we didn't have very much funding,
p53
aVso I had to reproduce it with virtual humans that were donated,
p54
aVand people begged and borrowed favors to help me create the models
p55
aVand make things as accurate as we could.
p56
aVAnd then we tried to convey what happened that day
p57
aVwith as much as accuracy as is possible.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Video) Voice: There's too many people! There's too many people!
p60
aa(lp61
VVoice: OK, he's having a seizure.
p62
aa(lp63
VVoice: We need an ambulance.
p64
aa(lp65
VNonny de la Peña: So the man on the right,
p66
aVfor him, he's walking around the body.
p67
aVFor him, he's in the room with that body.
p68
aVLike, that guy is at his feet.
p69
aVAnd even though, through his peripheral vision,
p70
aVhe can see that he's in this lab space,
p71
aVhe should be able to see that he's not actually on the street,
p72
aVbut he feels like he's there with those people.
p73
aVHe's very cautious not to step on this guy
p74
aVwho isn't really there, right?
p75
aa(lp76
VSo that piece ended up going to Sundance in 2012,
p77
aVa kind of amazing thing, and it was the first virtual reality film
p78
aVever, basically.
p79
aVAnd when we went, I was really terrified.
p80
aVI didn't really know how people were going to react
p81
aVand what was going to happen.
p82
aVAnd we showed up with this duct-taped pair of goggles.
p83
aa(lp84
V(Video) Oh, you're crying. You're crying. Gina, you're crying.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo you can hear the surprise in my voice, right?
p87
aVAnd this kind of reaction ended up being the kind of reaction we saw
p88
aVover and over and over:
p89
aVpeople down on the ground trying to comfort the seizure victim,
p90
aVtrying to whisper something into his ear
p91
aVor in some way help, even though they couldn't.
p92
aVAnd I had a lot of people come out of that piece saying,
p93
aV"Oh my God, I was so frustrated. I couldn't help the guy,"
p94
aVand take that back into their lives.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo after this piece was made,
p97
aVthe dean of the cinema school at USC, the University of Southern California,
p98
aVbrought in the head of the World Economic Forum to try "Hunger,"
p99
aVand he took off the goggles,
p100
aVand he commissioned a piece about Syria on the spot.
p101
aVAnd I really wanted to do something about Syrian refugee kids,
p102
aVbecause children have been the worst affected by the Syrian civil war.
p103
aVI sent a team to the border of Iraq to record material at refugee camps,
p104
aVbasically an area I wouldn't send a team now,
p105
aVas that's where ISIS is really operating.
p106
aVAnd then we also recreated a street scene
p107
aVin which a young girl is singing and a bomb goes off.
p108
aVNow, when you're in the middle of that scene
p109
aVand you hear those sounds,
p110
aVand you see the injured around you,
p111
aVit's an incredibly scary and real feeling.
p112
aVI've had individuals who have been involved in real bombings tell me
p113
aVthat it evokes the same kind of fear.
p114
aa(lp115
V[The civil war in Syria may seem far away]
p116
aV[until you experience it yourself.]
p117
aa(lp118

V(Explosion)
p121

V[Project Syria]
p123
aV[A virtual reality experience]
p124
aa(lp125
VNP: We were then invited to take the piece
p126
aVto the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
p127
aVAnd it wasn't advertised.
p128
aVAnd we were put in this tapestry room.
p129
aVThere was no press about it,
p130
aVso anybody who happened to walk into the museum to visit it that day
p131
aVwould see us with these crazy lights.
p132
aVYou know, maybe they would want to see the old storytelling of the tapestries.
p133
aVThey were confronted by our virtual reality cameras.
p134
aVBut a lot of people tried it, and over a five-day run
p135
aVwe ended up with 54 pages of guest book comments,
p136
aVand we were told by the curators there
p137
aVthat they'd never seen such an outpouring.
p138
aVThings like, "It's so real," "Absolutely believable,"
p139
aVor, of course, the one that I was excited about,
p140
aV"A real feeling as if you were in the middle of something
p141
aVthat you normally see on the TV news."
p142
aa(lp143
VSo, it works, right? This stuff works.
p144
aVAnd it doesn't really matter where you're from or what age you are \u2014
p145
aVit's really evocative.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow, don't get me wrong \u2014 I'm not saying that when you're in a piece
p148
aVyou forget that you're here.
p149
aVBut it turns out we can feel like we're in two places at once.
p150
aVWe can have what I call this duality of presence,
p151
aVand I think that's what allows me to tap into these feelings of empathy.
p152
aVRight?
p153
aa(lp154
VSo that means, of course,
p155
aVthat I have to be very cautious about creating these pieces.
p156
aVI have to really follow best journalistic practices
p157
aVand make sure that these powerful stories
p158
aVare built with integrity.
p159
aVIf we don't capture the material ourselves,
p160
aVwe have to be extremely exacting
p161
aVabout figuring out the provenance and where did this stuff come from
p162
aVand is it authentic?
p163
aa(lp164
VLet me give you an example.
p165
aVWith this Trayvon Martin case, this is a guy, a kid,
p166
aVwho was 17 years old and he bought soda and a candy at a store,
p167
aVand on his way home he was tracked by a neighborhood watchman
p168
aVnamed George Zimmerman who ended up shooting and killing him.
p169
aVTo make that piece,
p170
aVwe got the architectural drawings of the entire complex,
p171
aVand we rebuilt the entire scene inside and out, based on those drawings.
p172
aVAll of the action
p173
aVis informed by the real 911 recorded calls to the police.
p174
aVAnd interestingly, we broke some news with this story.
p175
aVThe forensic house that did the audio reconstruction, Primeau Productions,
p176
aVthey say that they would testify
p177
aVthat George Zimmerman, when he got out of the car,
p178
aVhe cocked his gun before he went to give chase to Martin.
p179
aa(lp180
VSo you can see that the basic tenets of journalism,
p181
aVthey don't really change here, right?
p182
aVWe're still following the same principles that we would always.
p183
aVWhat is different is the sense of being on scene,
p184
aVwhether you're watching a guy collapse from hunger
p185
aVor feeling like you're in the middle of a bomb scene.
p186
aVAnd this is kind of what has driven me forward with these pieces,
p187
aVand thinking about how to make them.
p188
aVWe're trying to make this, obviously, beyond the headset, more available.
p189
aVWe're creating mobile pieces like the Trayvon Martin piece.
p190
aVAnd these things have had impact.
p191
aVI've had Americans tell me that they've donated,
p192
aVdirect deductions from their bank account, money to go to Syrian children refugees.
p193
aVAnd "Hunger in LA," well, it's helped start
p194
aVa new form of doing journalism
p195
aVthat I think is going to join all the other normal platforms
p196
aVin the future.
p197
