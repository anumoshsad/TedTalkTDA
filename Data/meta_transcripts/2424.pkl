VAs a boy in Lima,
p4
aVmy grandfather told me a legend
p5
aVof the Spanish conquest of Peru.
p6
aVAtahualpa, emperor of the Inca, had been captured and killed.
p7
aVPizarro and his conquistadors had grown rich,
p8
aVand tales of their conquest and glory had reached Spain
p9
aVand was bringing new waves of Spaniards, hungry for gold and glory.
p10
aVThey would go into towns and ask the Inca,
p11
aV"Where's another civilization we can conquer? Where's more gold?"
p12
aa(lp13
VAnd the Inca, out of vengeance, told them,
p14
aV"Go to the Amazon.
p15
aVYou'll find all the gold you want there.
p16
aVIn fact, there is a city called Paititi \u2014 El Dorado in Spanish \u2014
p17
aVmade entirely of gold."
p18
aa(lp19
VThe Spanish set off into the jungle,
p20
aVbut the few that return come back with stories,
p21
aVstories of powerful shamans,
p22
aVof warriors with poisoned arrows,
p23
aVof trees so tall they blotted out the sun,
p24
aVspiders that ate birds, snakes that swallowed men whole
p25
aVand a river that boiled.
p26
aa(lp27
VAll this became a childhood memory.
p28
aVAnd years passed.
p29
aVI'm working on my PhD at SMU,
p30
aVtrying to understand Peru's geothermal energy potential,
p31
aVwhen I remember this legend,
p32
aVand I began asking that question.
p33
aVCould the boiling river exist?
p34
aa(lp35
VI asked colleagues from universities,
p36
aVthe government,
p37
aVoil, gas and mining companies,
p38
aVand the answer was a unanimous no.
p39
aVAnd this makes sense.
p40
aVYou see, boiling rivers do exist in the world,
p41
aVbut they're generally associated with volcanoes.
p42
aVYou need a powerful heat source
p43
aVto produce such a large geothermal manifestation.
p44
aVAnd as you can see from the red dots here, which are volcanoes,
p45
aVwe don't have volcanoes in the Amazon,
p46
aVnor in most of Peru.
p47
aVSo it follows: We should not expect to see a boiling river.
p48
aa(lp49
VTelling this same story at a family dinner,
p50
aVmy aunt tells me,
p51
aV"But no, Andrés, I've been there. I've swum in that river."
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VThen my uncle jumps in.
p56
aV"No, Andrés, she's not kidding.
p57
aVYou see, you can only swim in it after a very heavy rain,
p58
aVand it's protected by a powerful shaman.
p59
aVYour aunt, she's friends with his wife."
p60
aa(lp61
V(Laughter)
p62
aa(lp63
V"¿Cómo?" ["Huh?"]
p64
aa(lp65
VYou know, despite all my scientific skepticism,
p66
aVI found myself hiking into the jungle, guided by my aunt,
p67
aVover 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center,
p68
aVand well, honestly, mentally preparing myself
p69
aVto behold the legendary "warm stream of the Amazon."
p70
aa(lp71
VBut then ...
p72
aVI heard something,
p73
aVa low surge
p74
aVthat got louder and louder
p75
aVas we came closer.
p76
aVIt sounded like ocean waves constantly crashing,
p77
aVand as we got closer, I saw smoke, vapor, coming up through the trees.
p78
aVAnd then, I saw this.
p79
aa(lp80
VI immediately grabbed for my thermometer,
p81
aVand the average temperatures in the river
p82
aVwere 86 degrees C.
p83
aVThis is not quite the 100-degree C boiling
p84
aVbut definitely close enough.
p85
aVThe river flowed hot and fast.
p86
aVI followed it upriver and was led by, actually, the shaman's apprentice
p87
aVto the most sacred site on the river.
p88
aVAnd this is what's bizarre \u2014
p89
aVIt starts off as a cold stream.
p90
aVAnd here, at this site,
p91
aVis the home of the Yacumama,
p92
aVmother of the waters, a giant serpent spirit
p93
aVwho births hot and cold water.
p94
aVAnd here we find a hot spring,
p95
aVmixing with cold stream water underneath her protective motherly jaws
p96
aVand thus bringing their legends to life.
p97
aa(lp98
VThe next morning, I woke up and \u2014
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VI asked for tea.
p103
aVI was handed a mug, a tea bag
p104
aVand, well, pointed towards the river.
p105
aVTo my surprise, the water was clean and had a pleasant taste,
p106
aVwhich is a little weird for geothermal systems.
p107
aa(lp108
VWhat was amazing
p109
aVis that the locals had always known about this place,
p110
aVand that I was by no means the first outsider to see it.
p111
aVIt was just part of their everyday life.
p112
aVThey drink its water.
p113
aVThey take in its vapor.
p114
aVThey cook with it,
p115
aVclean with it,
p116
aVeven make their medicines with it.
p117
aa(lp118
VI met the shaman,
p119
aVand he seemed like an extension of the river and his jungle.
p120
aVHe asked for my intentions
p121
aVand listened carefully.
p122
aVThen, to my tremendous relief \u2014
p123
aVI was freaking out, to be honest with you \u2014
p124
aVa smile began to snake across his face, and he just laughed.
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VI had received the shaman's blessing to study the river,
p129
aVon the condition that after I take the water samples
p130
aVand analyze them in my lab,
p131
aVwherever I was in the world,
p132
aVthat I pour the waters back into the ground
p133
aVso that, as the shaman said,
p134
aVthe waters could find their way back home.
p135
aa(lp136
VI've been back every year since that first visit in 2011,
p137
aVand the fieldwork has been exhilarating,
p138
aVdemanding and at times dangerous.
p139
aVOne story was even featured in National Geographic Magazine.
p140
aVI was trapped on a small rock about the size of a sheet of paper
p141
aVin sandals and board shorts,
p142
aVin between an 80 degree C river
p143
aVand a hot spring that, well, looked like this, close to boiling.
p144
aVAnd on top of that, it was Amazon rain forest.
p145
aVPshh, pouring rain, couldn't see a thing.
p146
aVThe temperature differential made it all white. It was a whiteout.
p147
aVIntense.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow, after years of work,
p150
aVI'll soon be submitting my geophysical and geochemical studies for publication.
p151
aVAnd I'd like to share, today, with all of you here, on the TED stage,
p152
aVfor the first time, some of these discoveries.
p153
aa(lp154
VWell, first off, it's not a legend.
p155
aVSurprise!
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VWhen I first started the research,
p160
aVthe satellite imagery was too low-resolution to be meaningful.
p161
aVThere were just no good maps.
p162
aVThanks to the support of the Google Earth team,
p163
aVI now have this.
p164
aVNot only that, the indigenous name of the river, Shanay-timpishka,
p165
aV"boiled with the heat of the sun,"
p166
aVindicating that I'm not the first to wonder why the river boils,
p167
aVand showing that humanity has always sought to explain
p168
aVthe world around us.
p169
aa(lp170
VSo why does the river boil?
p171
aa(lp172
V(Bubbling sounds)
p173
aa(lp174
VIt actually took me three years to get that footage.
p175
aa(lp176
VFault-fed hot springs.
p177
aVAs we have hot blood running through our veins and arteries,
p178
aVso, too, the earth has hot water running through its cracks and faults.
p179
aVWhere these arteries come to the surface, these earth arteries,
p180
aVwe'll get geothermal manifestations:
p181
aVfumaroles, hot springs and in our case, the boiling river.
p182
aa(lp183
VWhat's truly incredible, though, is the scale of this place.
p184
aVNext time you cross the road, think about this.
p185
aVThe river flows wider than a two-lane road
p186
aValong most of its path.
p187
aVIt flows hot for 6.24 kilometers.
p188
aVTruly impressive.
p189
aVThere are thermal pools larger than this TED stage,
p190
aVand that waterfall that you see there
p191
aVis six meters tall \u2014
p192
aVand all with near-boiling water.
p193
aa(lp194
VWe mapped the temperatures along the river,
p195
aVand this was by far the most demanding part of the fieldwork.
p196
aVAnd the results were just awesome.
p197
aVSorry \u2014 the geoscientist in me coming out.
p198
aVAnd it showed this amazing trend.
p199
aVYou see, the river starts off cold.
p200
aVIt then heats up, cools back down, heats up, cools back down,
p201
aVheats up again, and then has this beautiful decay curve
p202
aVuntil it smashes into this cold river.
p203
aa(lp204
VNow, I understand not all of you are geothermal scientists,
p205
aVso to put it in more everyday terms:
p206
aVEveryone loves coffee.
p207
aVYes? Good.
p208
aVYour regular cup of coffee, 54 degrees C,
p209
aVan extra-hot one, well, 60.
p210
aVSo, put in coffee shop terms,
p211
aVthe boiling river plots like this.
p212
aVThere you have your hot coffee.
p213
aVHere you have your extra-hot coffee,
p214
aVand you can see that there's a bit point there
p215
aVwhere the river is still hotter than even the extra-hot coffee.
p216
aVAnd these are average water temperatures.
p217
aVWe took these in the dry season to ensure the purest geothermal temperatures.
p218
aa(lp219
VBut there's a magic number here that's not being shown,
p220
aVand that number is 47 degrees C,
p221
aVbecause that's where things start to hurt,
p222
aVand I know this from very personal experience.
p223
aVAbove that temperature, you don't want to get in that water.
p224
aVYou need to be careful.
p225
aVIt can be deadly.
p226
aa(lp227
VI've seen all sorts of animals fall in,
p228
aVand what's shocking to me, is the process is pretty much the same.
p229
aVSo they fall in and the first thing to go are the eyes.
p230
aVEyes, apparently, cook very quickly. They turn this milky-white color.
p231
aVThe stream is carrying them.
p232
aVThey're trying to swim out, but their meat is cooking on the bone
p233
aVbecause it's so hot.
p234
aVSo they're losing power, losing power,
p235
aVuntil finally they get to a point where hot water goes into their mouths
p236
aVand they cook from the inside out.
p237
aa(lp238
V(Laughter)
p239
aa(lp240
VA bit sadistic, aren't we?
p241
aVJeez.
p242
aVLeave them marinating for a little longer.
p243
aVWhat's, again, amazing are these temperatures.
p244
aVThey're similar to things that I've seen on volcanoes all over the world
p245
aVand even super-volcanoes like Yellowstone.
p246
aa(lp247
VBut here's the thing:
p248
aVthe data is showing that the boiling river exists
p249
aVindependent of volcanism.
p250
aVIt's neither magmatic or volcanic in origin,
p251
aVand again, over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center.
p252
aa(lp253
VHow can a boiling river exist like this?
p254
aVI've asked geothermal experts and volcanologists for years,
p255
aVand I'm still unable to find another non-volcanic geothermal system
p256
aVof this magnitude.
p257
aVIt's unique.
p258
aVIt's special on a global scale.
p259
aVSo, still \u2014 how does it work?
p260
aVWhere do we get this heat?
p261
aVThere's still more research to be done
p262
aVto better constrain the problem and better understand the system,
p263
aVbut from what the data is telling us now,
p264
aVit looks to be the result of a large hydrothermal system.
p265
aa(lp266
VBasically, it works like this:
p267
aVSo, the deeper you go into the earth, the hotter it gets.
p268
aVWe refer to this as the geothermal gradient.
p269
aVThe waters could be coming from as far away as glaciers in the Andes,
p270
aVthen seeping down deep into the earth
p271
aVand coming out to form the boiling river
p272
aVafter getting heated up from the geothermal gradient,
p273
aVall due to this unique geologic setting.
p274
aa(lp275
VNow, we found that in and around the river \u2014
p276
aVthis is working with colleagues
p277
aVfrom National Geographic, Dr. Spencer Wells,
p278
aVand Dr. Jon Eisen from UC Davis \u2014
p279
aVwe genetically sequenced the extremophile lifeforms
p280
aVliving in and around the river, and have found new lifeforms,
p281
aVunique species living in the boiling river.
p282
aa(lp283
VBut again, despite all of these studies, all of these discoveries and the legends,
p284
aVa question remains:
p285
aVWhat is the significance of the boiling river?
p286
aVWhat is the significance of this stationary cloud
p287
aVthat always hovers over this patch of jungle?
p288
aVAnd what is the significance
p289
aVof a detail in a childhood legend?
p290
aa(lp291
VTo the shaman and his community, it's a sacred site.
p292
aVTo me, as a geoscientist,
p293
aVit's a unique geothermal phenomenon.
p294
aVBut to the illegal loggers and cattle farmers,
p295
aVit's just another resource to exploit.
p296
aVAnd to the Peruvian government, it's just another stretch
p297
aVof unprotected land ready for development.
p298
aa(lp299
VMy goal is to ensure that whoever controls this land
p300
aVunderstands the boiling river's uniqueness and significance.
p301
aVBecause that's the question,
p302
aVone of significance.
p303
aVAnd the thing there is,
p304
aVwe define significance.
p305
aVIt's us. We have that power.
p306
aVWe are the ones who draw that line
p307
aVbetween the sacred and the trivial.
p308
aVAnd in this age,
p309
aVwhere everything seems mapped, measured and studied,
p310
aVin this age of information,
p311
aVI remind you all that discoveries are not just made
p312
aVin the black void of the unknown
p313
aVbut in the white noise of overwhelming data.
p314
aa(lp315
VThere remains so much to explore.
p316
aVWe live in an incredible world.
p317
aVSo go out.
p318
aVBe curious.
p319
aVBecause we do live in a world
p320
aVwhere shamans still sing to the spirits of the jungle,
p321
aVwhere rivers do boil
p322
aVand where legends do come to life.
p323
aa(lp324
VThank you very much.
