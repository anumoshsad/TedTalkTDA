VChris Anderson: So, this is an interview with a difference.
p4
aVOn the basis that a picture is worth a thousand words,
p5
aVwhat I did was, I asked Bill and Melinda
p6
aVto dig out from their archive
p7
aVsome images that would help explain
p8
aVsome of what they've done,
p9
aVand do a few things that way.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo, we're going to start here.
p12
aVMelinda, when and where was this,
p13
aVand who is that handsome man next to you?
p14
aa(lp15
VMelinda Gates: With those big glasses, huh?
p16
aVThis is in Africa, our very first trip,
p17
aVthe first time either of us had ever been to Africa,
p18
aVin the fall of 1993.
p19
aVWe were already engaged to be married.
p20
aVWe married a few months later,
p21
aVand this was the trip where we really went to see
p22
aVthe animals and to see the savanna.
p23
aVIt was incredible. Bill had never taken that much time
p24
aVoff from work.
p25
aVBut what really touched us, actually, were the people,
p26
aVand the extreme poverty.
p27
aVWe started asking ourselves questions.
p28
aVDoes it have to be like this?
p29
aVAnd at the end of the trip,
p30
aVwe went out to Zanzibar,
p31
aVand took some time to walk on the beach,
p32
aVwhich is something we had done a lot
p33
aVwhile we were dating.
p34
aVAnd we'd already been talking about during that time
p35
aVthat the wealth that had come from Microsoft
p36
aVwould be given back to society,
p37
aVbut it was really on that beach walk
p38
aVthat we started to talk about, well,
p39
aVwhat might we do and how might we go about it?
p40
aa(lp41
VCA: So, given that this vacation
p42
aVled to the creation of
p43
aVthe world's biggest private foundation,
p44
aVit's pretty expensive as vacations go. (Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VMG: I guess so. We enjoyed it.
p47
aa(lp48
VCA: Which of you was the key instigator here,
p49
aVor was it symmetrical?
p50
aVBill Gates: Well, I think we were excited
p51
aVthat there'd be a phase of our life
p52
aVwhere we'd get to work together
p53
aVand figure out how to give this money back.
p54
aVAt this stage, we were talking about the poorest,
p55
aVand could you have a big impact on them?
p56
aVWere there things that weren't being done?
p57
aVThere was a lot we didn't know.
p58
aVOur naïveté is pretty incredible,
p59
aVwhen we look back on it.
p60
aVBut we had a certain enthusiasm
p61
aVthat that would be the phase,
p62
aVthe post-Microsoft phase
p63
aVwould be our philanthropy.
p64
aa(lp65
VMG: Which Bill always thought was going to come
p66
aVafter he was 60,
p67
aVso he hasn't quite hit 60 yet,
p68
aVso some things change along the way.
p69
aa(lp70
VCA: So it started there, but it got accelerated.
p71
aVSo that was '93, and it was '97, really,
p72
aVbefore the foundation itself started.
p73
aa(lp74
VMA: Yeah, in '97, we read an article
p75
aVabout diarrheal diseases killing so many kids around the world,
p76
aVand we kept saying to ourselves,
p77
aV"Well that can't be.
p78
aVIn the U.S., you just go down to the drug store."
p79
aVAnd so we started gathering scientists
p80
aVand started learning about population,
p81
aVlearning about vaccines,
p82
aVlearning about what had worked and what had failed,
p83
aVand that's really when we got going,
p84
aVwas in late 1998, 1999.
p85
aa(lp86
VCA: So, you've got a big pot of money
p87
aVand a world full of so many different issues.
p88
aVHow on Earth do you decide what to focus on?
p89
aa(lp90
VBG: Well, we decided that we'd pick two causes,
p91
aVwhatever the biggest inequity was globally,
p92
aVand there we looked at children dying,
p93
aVchildren not having enough nutrition to ever develop,
p94
aVand countries that were really stuck,
p95
aVbecause with that level of death,
p96
aVand parents would have so many kids
p97
aVthat they'd get huge population growth,
p98
aVand that the kids were so sick
p99
aVthat they really couldn't be educated
p100
aVand lift themselves up.
p101
aVSo that was our global thing,
p102
aVand then in the U.S.,
p103
aVboth of us have had amazing educations,
p104
aVand we saw that as the way that the U.S.
p105
aVcould live up to its promise of equal opportunity
p106
aVis by having a phenomenal education system,
p107
aVand the more we learned, the more we realized
p108
aVwe're not really fulfilling that promise.
p109
aVAnd so we picked those two things,
p110
aVand everything the foundation does
p111
aVis focused there.
p112
aa(lp113
VCA: So, I asked each of you to pick an image
p114
aVthat you like that illustrates your work,
p115
aVand Melinda, this is what you picked.
p116
aVWhat's this about?
p117
aa(lp118
VMG: So I, one of the things I love to do when I travel
p119
aVis to go out to the rural areas and talk to the women,
p120
aVwhether it's Bangladesh, India, lots of countries in Africa,
p121
aVand I go in as a Western woman without a name.
p122
aVI don't tell them who I am. Pair of khakis.
p123
aVAnd I kept hearing from women,
p124
aVover and over and over, the more I traveled,
p125
aV"I want to be able to use this shot."
p126
aVI would be there to talk to them about childhood vaccines,
p127
aVand they would bring the conversation around to
p128
aV"But what about the shot I get?"
p129
aVwhich is an injection they were getting called Depo-Provera,
p130
aVwhich is a contraceptive.
p131
aVAnd I would come back and talk to global health experts,
p132
aVand they'd say, "Oh no, contraceptives
p133
aVare stocked in in the developing world."
p134
aVWell, you had to dig deeper into the reports,
p135
aVand this is what the team came to me with,
p136
aVwhich is, to have the number one thing
p137
aVthat women tell you in Africa they want to use
p138
aVstocked out more than 200 days a year
p139
aVexplains why women were saying to me,
p140
aV"I walked 10 kilometers without my husband knowing it,
p141
aVand I got to the clinic, and there was nothing there."
p142
aVAnd so condoms were stocked in in Africa
p143
aVbecause of all the AIDS work that the U.S.
p144
aVand others supported.
p145
aVBut women will tell you over and over again,
p146
aV"I can't negotiate a condom with my husband.
p147
aVI'm either suggesting he has AIDS or I have AIDS,
p148
aVand I need that tool because then I can space
p149
aVthe births of my children, and I can feed them
p150
aVand have a chance of educating them."
p151
aa(lp152
VCA: Melinda, you're Roman Catholic,
p153
aVand you've often been embroiled
p154
aVin controversy over this issue,
p155
aVand on the abortion question,
p156
aVon both sides, really.
p157
aVHow do you navigate that?
p158
aa(lp159
VMG: Yeah, so I think that's a really important point,
p160
aVwhich is, we had backed away from contraceptives
p161
aVas a global community.
p162
aVWe knew that 210 million women
p163
aVwere saying they wanted access to contraceptives,
p164
aVeven the contraceptives we have here in the United States,
p165
aVand we weren't providing them
p166
aVbecause of the political controversy in our country,
p167
aVand to me that was just a crime,
p168
aVand I kept looking around trying to find the person
p169
aVthat would get this back on the global stage,
p170
aVand I finally realized I just had to do it.
p171
aVAnd even though I'm Catholic,
p172
aVI believe in contraceptives
p173
aVjust like most of the Catholic women in the United States
p174
aVwho report using contraceptives,
p175
aVand I shouldn't let that controversy
p176
aVbe the thing that holds us back.
p177
aVWe used to have consensus in the United States
p178
aVaround contraceptives,
p179
aVand so we got back to that global consensus,
p180
aVand actually raised 2.6 billion dollars
p181
aVaround exactly this issue for women.
p182
aV(Applause)
p183
aa(lp184
VCA: Bill, this is your graph. What's this about?
p185
aa(lp186
VBG: Well, my graph has numbers on it.
p187
aV(Laughter)
p188
aVI really like this graph.
p189
aVThis is the number of children
p190
aVwho die before the age of five every year.
p191
aVAnd what you find is really
p192
aVa phenomenal success story
p193
aVwhich is not widely known,
p194
aVthat we are making incredible progress.
p195
aVWe go from 20 million
p196
aVnot long after I was born
p197
aVto now we're down to about six million.
p198
aVSo this is a story
p199
aVlargely of vaccines.
p200
aVSmallpox was killing a couple million kids a year.
p201
aVThat was eradicated, so that got down to zero.
p202
aVMeasles was killing a couple million a year.
p203
aVThat's down to a few hundred thousand.
p204
aVAnyway, this is a chart
p205
aVwhere you want to get that number to continue,
p206
aVand it's going to be possible,
p207
aVusing the science of new vaccines,
p208
aVgetting the vaccines out to kids.
p209
aVWe can actually accelerate the progress.
p210
aVThe last decade,
p211
aVthat number has dropped faster
p212
aVthan ever in history,
p213
aVand so I just love the fact that
p214
aVyou can say, okay, if we can invent new vaccines,
p215
aVwe can get them out there,
p216
aVuse the very latest understanding of these things,
p217
aVand get the delivery right, that we can perform a miracle.
p218
aa(lp219
VCA: I mean, you do the math on this,
p220
aVand it works out, I think, literally
p221
aVto thousands of kids' lives saved every day
p222
aVcompared to the prior year.
p223
aVIt's not reported.
p224
aVAn airliner with 200-plus deaths
p225
aVis a far, far bigger story than that.
p226
aVDoes that drive you crazy?
p227
aa(lp228
VBG: Yeah, because it's a silent thing going on.
p229
aVIt's a kid, one kid at a time.
p230
aVNinety-eight percent of this
p231
aVhas nothing to do with natural disasters,
p232
aVand yet, people's charity,
p233
aVwhen they see a natural disaster, are wonderful.
p234
aVIt's incredible how people think, okay,
p235
aVthat could be me, and the money flows.
p236
aVThese causes have been a bit invisible.
p237
aVNow that the Millennium Development Goals
p238
aVand various things are getting out there,
p239
aVwe are seeing some increased generosity,
p240
aVso the goal is to get this well below a million,
p241
aVwhich should be possible in our lifetime.
p242
aa(lp243
VCA: Maybe it needed someone
p244
aVwho is turned on by numbers and graphs
p245
aVrather than just the big, sad face
p246
aVto get engaged.
p247
aVI mean, you've used it in your letter this year,
p248
aVyou used basically this argument to say that aid,
p249
aVcontrary to the current meme
p250
aVthat aid is kind of worthless and broken,
p251
aVthat actually it has been effective.
p252
aa(lp253
VBG: Yeah, well people can take,
p254
aVthere is some aid that was well-meaning
p255
aVand didn't go well.
p256
aVThere's some venture capital investments
p257
aVthat were well-meaning and didn't go well.
p258
aVYou shouldn't just say, okay, because of that,
p259
aVbecause we don't have a perfect record,
p260
aVthis is a bad endeavor.
p261
aVYou should look at, what was your goal?
p262
aVHow are you trying to uplift nutrition
p263
aVand survival and literacy
p264
aVso these countries can take care of themselves,
p265
aVand say wow, this is going well,
p266
aVand be smarter.
p267
aVWe can spend aid smarter.
p268
aVIt is not all a panacea.
p269
aVWe can do better than venture capital, I think,
p270
aVincluding big hits like this.
p271
aa(lp272
VCA: Traditional wisdom is that
p273
aVit's pretty hard for married couples to work together.
p274
aVHow have you guys managed it?
p275
aVMG: Yeah, I've had a lot of women say to me,
p276
aV"I really don't think I could work with my husband.
p277
aVThat just wouldn't work out."
p278
aVYou know, we enjoy it, and we don't \u2014
p279
aVthis foundation has been a coming to for both of us
p280
aVin its continuous learning journey,
p281
aVand we don't travel together as much
p282
aVfor the foundation, actually, as we used to
p283
aVwhen Bill was working at Microsoft.
p284
aVWe have more trips where we're traveling separately,
p285
aVbut I always know when I come home,
p286
aVBill's going to be interested in what I learned,
p287
aVwhether it's about women or girls
p288
aVor something new about the vaccine delivery chain,
p289
aVor this person that is a great leader.
p290
aVHe's going to listen and be really interested.
p291
aVAnd he knows when he comes home,
p292
aVeven if it's to talk about the speech he did
p293
aVor the data or what he's learned,
p294
aVI'm really interested,
p295
aVand I think we have a really collaborative relationship.
p296
aVBut we don't every minute together, that's for sure.
p297
aV(Laughter)
p298
aa(lp299
VCA: But now you are, and we're very happy that you are.
p300
aVMelinda, early on, you were basically
p301
aVlargely running the show.
p302
aVSix years ago, I guess,
p303
aVBill came on full time, so moved from Microsoft
p304
aVand became full time.
p305
aVThat must have been hard,
p306
aVadjusting to that. No?
p307
aa(lp308
VMG: Yeah. I think actually,
p309
aVfor the foundation employees,
p310
aVthere was way more angst for them
p311
aVthan there was for me about Bill coming.
p312
aVI was actually really excited.
p313
aVI mean, Bill made this decision
p314
aVeven obviously before it got announced in 2006,
p315
aVand it was really his decision,
p316
aVbut again, it was a beach vacation
p317
aVwhere we were walking on the beach
p318
aVand he was starting to think of this idea.
p319
aVAnd for me, the excitement of Bill
p320
aVputting his brain and his heart
p321
aVagainst these huge global problems,
p322
aVthese inequities, to me that was exciting.
p323
aVYes, the foundation employees had angst about that.
p324
aV(Applause)
p325
aa(lp326
VCA: That's cool.
p327
aa(lp328
VMG: But that went away within three months,
p329
aVonce he was there.
p330
aa(lp331
VBG: Including some of the employees.
p332
aa(lp333
VMG: That's what I said, the employees,
p334
aVit went away for them three months after you were there.
p335
aa(lp336
VBG: No, I'm kidding. MG: Oh, you mean, the employees didn't go away.
p337
aa(lp338
VBG: A few of them did, but \u2014
p339
aV(Laughter)
p340
aa(lp341
VCA: So what do you guys argue about?
p342
aVSunday, 11 o'clock,
p343
aVyou're away from work,
p344
aVwhat comes up? What's the argument?
p345
aa(lp346
VBG: Because we built this thing
p347
aVtogether from the beginning,
p348
aVit's this great partnership.
p349
aVI had that with Paul Allen
p350
aVin the early days of Microsoft.
p351
aVI had it with Steve Ballmer as Microsoft got bigger,
p352
aVand now Melinda, and in even stronger,
p353
aVequal ways, is the partner,
p354
aVso we talk a lot about
p355
aVwhich things should we give more to,
p356
aVwhich groups are working well?
p357
aVShe's got a lot of insight.
p358
aVShe'll sit down with the employees a lot.
p359
aVWe'll take the different trips she described.
p360
aVSo there's a lot of collaboration.
p361
aVI can't think of anything where one of us
p362
aVhad a super strong opinion
p363
aVabout one thing or another?
p364
aa(lp365
VCA: How about you, Melinda,  though? Can you? (Laughter)
p366
aVYou never know.
p367
aa(lp368
VMG: Well, here's the thing.
p369
aVWe come at things from different angles,
p370
aVand I actually think that's really good.
p371
aVSo Bill can look at the big data
p372
aVand say, "I want to act based on these global statistics."
p373
aVFor me, I come at it from intuition.
p374
aVI meet with lots of people on the ground
p375
aVand Bill's taught me to take that
p376
aVand read up to the global data and see if they match,
p377
aVand I think what I've taught him
p378
aVis to take that data
p379
aVand meet with people on the ground to understand,
p380
aVcan you actually deliver that vaccine?
p381
aVCan you get a woman to accept those polio drops
p382
aVin her child's mouth?
p383
aVBecause the delivery piece
p384
aVis every bit as important as the science.
p385
aVSo I think it's been more a coming to over time
p386
aVtowards each other's point of view,
p387
aVand quite frankly, the work is better because of it.
p388
aa(lp389
VCA: So, in vaccines and polio and so forth,
p390
aVyou've had some amazing successes.
p391
aVWhat about failure, though?
p392
aVCan you talk about a failure
p393
aVand maybe what you've learned from it?
p394
aa(lp395
VBG: Yeah. Fortunately, we can afford a few failures,
p396
aVbecause we've certainly had them.
p397
aVWe do a lot of drug work or vaccine work
p398
aVthat you know you're going to have different failures.
p399
aVLike, we put out, one that got a lot of publicity
p400
aVwas asking for a better condom.
p401
aVWell, we got hundreds of ideas.
p402
aVMaybe a few of those will work out.
p403
aVWe were very naïve, certainly I was, about a drug
p404
aVfor a disease in India, visceral leishmaniasis,
p405
aVthat I thought, once I got this drug,
p406
aVwe can just go wipe out the disease.
p407
aVWell, turns out it took an injection
p408
aVevery day for 10 days.
p409
aVIt took three more years to get it than we expected,
p410
aVand then there was no way
p411
aVit was going to get out there.
p412
aVFortunately, we found out
p413
aVthat if you go kill the sand flies,
p414
aVyou probably can have success there,
p415
aVbut we spent five years,
p416
aVyou could say wasted five years,
p417
aVand about 60 million,
p418
aVon a path that turned out to have
p419
aVvery modest benefit when we got there.
p420
aa(lp421
VCA: You're spending, like, a billion dollars a year
p422
aVin education, I think, something like that.
p423
aVIs anything, the story of what's gone right there
p424
aVis quite a long and complex one.
p425
aVAre there any failures that you can talk about?
p426
aa(lp427
VMG: Well, I would say a huge lesson for us
p428
aVout of the early work is we thought
p429
aVthat these small schools were the answer,
p430
aVand small schools definitely help.
p431
aVThey bring down the dropout rate.
p432
aVThey have less violence and crime in those schools.
p433
aVBut the thing that we learned from that work,
p434
aVand what turned out to be the fundamental key,
p435
aVis a great teacher in front of the classroom.
p436
aVIf you don't have an effective teacher
p437
aVin the front of the classroom,
p438
aVI don't care how big or small the building is,
p439
aVyou're not going to change the trajectory
p440
aVof whether that student will be ready for college.
p441
aV(Applause)
p442
aa(lp443
VCA: So Melinda, this is you and
p444
aVyour eldest daughter, Jenn.
p445
aVAnd just taken about three weeks ago, I think,
p446
aVthree or four weeks ago. Where was this?
p447
aa(lp448
VMG: So we went to Tanzania.
p449
aVJenn's been to Tanzania.
p450
aVAll our kids have been to Africa quite a bit, actually.
p451
aVAnd we did something very different,
p452
aVwhich is, we decided to go spend
p453
aVtwo nights and three days with a family.
p454
aVAnna and Sanare are the parents.
p455
aVThey invited us to come and stay in their boma.
p456
aVActually, the goats had been there, I think,
p457
aVliving in that particular little hut
p458
aVon their little compound before we got there.
p459
aVAnd we stayed with their family,
p460
aVand we really, really learned
p461
aVwhat life is like in rural Tanzania.
p462
aVAnd the difference between just going
p463
aVand visiting for half a day
p464
aVor three quarters of a day
p465
aVversus staying overnight was profound,
p466
aVand so let me just give you one explanation of that.
p467
aVThey had six children, and as I talked to Anna
p468
aVin the kitchen, we cooked for about five hours
p469
aVin the cooking hut that day,
p470
aVand as I talked to her, she had absolutely planned
p471
aVand spaced with her husband
p472
aVthe births of their children.
p473
aVIt was a very loving relationship.
p474
aVThis was a Maasai warrior and his wife,
p475
aVbut they had decided to get married,
p476
aVthey clearly had respect and love in the relationship.
p477
aVTheir children, their six children,
p478
aVthe two in the middle were twins, 13,
p479
aVa boy, and a girl named Grace.
p480
aVAnd when we'd go out to chop wood
p481
aVand do all the things that Grace and her mother would do,
p482
aVGrace was not a child, she was an adolescent,
p483
aVbut she wasn't an adult.
p484
aVShe was very, very shy.
p485
aVSo she kept wanting to talk to me and Jenn.
p486
aVWe kept trying to engage her, but she was shy.
p487
aVAnd at night, though,
p488
aVwhen all the lights went out in rural Tanzania,
p489
aVand there was no moon that night,
p490
aVthe first night, and no stars,
p491
aVand Jenn came out of our hut
p492
aVwith her REI little headlamp on,
p493
aVGrace went immediately,
p494
aVand got the translator,
p495
aVcame straight up to my Jenn and said,
p496
aV"When you go home,
p497
aVcan I have your headlamp
p498
aVso I can study at night?"
p499
aa(lp500
VCA: Oh, wow.
p501
aa(lp502
VMG: And her dad had told me
p503
aVhow afraid he was that unlike the son,
p504
aVwho had passed his secondary exams,
p505
aVbecause of her chores,
p506
aVshe'd not done so well
p507
aVand wasn't in the government school yet.
p508
aVHe said, "I don't know how I'm going to pay for her education.
p509
aVI can't pay for private school,
p510
aVand she may end up on this farm like my wife."
p511
aVSo they know the difference
p512
aVthat an education can make
p513
aVin a huge, profound way.
p514
aa(lp515
VCA: I mean, this is another pic
p516
aVof your other two kids, Rory and Phoebe,
p517
aValong with Paul Farmer.
p518
aVBringing up three children
p519
aVwhen you're the world's richest family
p520
aVseems like a social experiment
p521
aVwithout much prior art.
p522
aVHow have you managed it?
p523
aVWhat's been your approach?
p524
aa(lp525
VBG: Well, I'd say overall
p526
aVthe kids get a great education,
p527
aVbut you've got to make sure
p528
aVthey have a sense of their own ability
p529
aVand what they're going to go and do,
p530
aVand our philosophy has been
p531
aVto be very clear with them \u2014
p532
aVmost of the money's going to the foundation \u2014
p533
aVand help them find something they're excited about.
p534
aVWe want to strike a balance where they have
p535
aVthe freedom to do anything
p536
aVbut not a lot of money showered on them
p537
aVso they could go out and do nothing.
p538
aVAnd so far, they're fairly diligent,
p539
aVexcited to pick their own direction.
p540
aa(lp541
VCA: You've obviously guarded their  privacy carefully for obvious reasons.
p542
aVI'm curious why you've given me permission
p543
aVto show this picture now here at TED.
p544
aVMG: Well, it's interesting.
p545
aVAs they get older, they so know
p546
aVthat our family belief is about responsibility,
p547
aVthat we are in an unbelievable situation
p548
aVjust to live in the United States
p549
aVand have a great education,
p550
aVand we have a responsibility to give back to the world.
p551
aVAnd so as they get older
p552
aVand we are teaching them \u2014
p553
aVthey have been to so many countries around the world \u2014
p554
aVthey're saying,
p555
aVwe do want people to know that we believe
p556
aVin what you're doing, Mom and Dad,
p557
aVand it is okay to show us more.
p558
aVSo we have their permission to show this picture,
p559
aVand I think Paul Farmer is probably going to put it
p560
aVeventually in some of his work.
p561
aVBut they really care deeply
p562
aVabout the mission of the foundation, too.
p563
aa(lp564
VCA: You've easily got enough money
p565
aVdespite your vast contributions to the foundation
p566
aVto make them all billionaires.
p567
aVIs that your plan for them?
p568
aa(lp569
VBG: Nope. No. They won't have anything like that.
p570
aVThey need to have a sense
p571
aVthat their own work is meaningful and important.
p572
aVWe read an article long, actually, before we got married,
p573
aVwhere Warren Buffett talked about that,
p574
aVand we're quite convinced that it wasn't a favor
p575
aVeither to society or to the kids.
p576
aa(lp577
VCA: Well, speaking of Warren Buffett,
p578
aVsomething really amazing happened in 2006,
p579
aVwhen somehow your only real rival
p580
aVfor richest person in America
p581
aVsuddenly turned around and agreed to give
p582
aV80 percent of his fortune
p583
aVto your foundation.
p584
aVHow on Earth did that happen?
p585
aVI guess there's a long version and a short version of that.
p586
aVWe've got time for the short version.
p587
aa(lp588
VBG: All right. Well, Warren was a close friend,
p589
aVand he was going to have his wife Suzie
p590
aVgive it all away.
p591
aVTragically, she passed away before he did,
p592
aVand he's big on delegation, and
p593
aV\u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p594
aVhe said \u2014
p595
aa(lp596
VCA: Tweet that.
p597
aa(lp598
VBG: If he's got somebody who is doing something well,
p599
aVand is willing to do it at no charge,
p600
aVmaybe that's okay. But we were stunned.
p601
aVMG: Totally stunned. BG: We had never expected it,
p602
aVand it has been unbelievable.
p603
aVIt's allowed us to increase our ambition
p604
aVin what the foundation can do quite dramatically.
p605
aVHalf the resources we have
p606
aVcome from Warren's mind-blowing generosity.
p607
aa(lp608
VCA: And I think you've pledged that
p609
aVby the time you're done,
p610
aVmore than, or 95 percent of your wealth,
p611
aVwill be given to the foundation.
p612
aa(lp613
VBG: Yes.
p614
aa(lp615
VCA: And since this relationship, it's amazing\u2014
p616
aV(Applause)
p617
aVAnd recently, you and Warren
p618
aVhave been going around trying to persuade
p619
aVother billionaires and successful people
p620
aVto pledge to give, what,
p621
aVmore than half of their assets for philanthropy.
p622
aVHow is that going?
p623
aVBG: Well, we've got about 120 people
p624
aVwho have now taken this giving pledge.
p625
aVThe thing that's great is that we get together
p626
aVyearly and talk about, okay,
p627
aVdo you hire staff, what do you give to them?
p628
aVWe're not trying to homogenize it.
p629
aVI mean, the beauty of philanthropy
p630
aVis this mind-blowing diversity.
p631
aVPeople give to some things.
p632
aVWe look and go, "Wow."
p633
aVBut that's great.
p634
aVThat's the role of philanthropy
p635
aVis to pick different approaches,
p636
aVincluding even in one space, like education.
p637
aVWe need more experimentation.
p638
aVBut it's been wonderful, meeting those people,
p639
aVsharing their journey to philanthropy,
p640
aVhow they involve their kids,
p641
aVwhere they're doing it differently,
p642
aVand it's been way more successful than we expected.
p643
aVNow it looks like it'll just keep growing in size
p644
aVin the years ahead.
p645
aa(lp646
VMG: And having people see that other people
p647
aVare making change with philanthropy,
p648
aVI mean, these are people who have
p649
aVcreated their own businesses,
p650
aVput their own ingenuity behind incredible ideas.
p651
aVIf they put their ideas and their brain
p652
aVbehind philanthropy, they can change the world.
p653
aVAnd they start to see others doing it, and saying,
p654
aV"Wow, I want to do that with my own money."
p655
aVTo me, that's the piece that's incredible.
p656
aa(lp657
VCA: It seems to me, it's actually really hard
p658
aVfor some people to figure out
p659
aVeven how to remotely spend that much money
p660
aVon something else.
p661
aVThere are probably some billionaires in the room
p662
aVand certainly some successful people.
p663
aVI'm curious, can you make the pitch?
p664
aVWhat's the pitch?
p665
aa(lp666
VBG: Well, it's the most fulfilling thing
p667
aVwe've ever done,
p668
aVand you can't take it with you,
p669
aVand if it's not good for your kids,
p670
aVlet's get together and brainstorm
p671
aVabout what we can be done.
p672
aVThe world is a far better place
p673
aVbecause of the philanthropists of the past,
p674
aVand the U.S. tradition here, which is the strongest,
p675
aVis the envy of the world.
p676
aVAnd part of the reason I'm so optimistic
p677
aVis because I do think philanthropy
p678
aVis going to grow
p679
aVand take some of these things
p680
aVgovernment's not just good at working on and discovering
p681
aVand shine some light in the right direction.
p682
aa(lp683
VCA: The world's got this terrible inequality,
p684
aVgrowing inequality problem
p685
aVthat seems structural.
p686
aVIt does seem to me that if more of your peers
p687
aVtook the approach that you two have made,
p688
aVit would make a dent
p689
aVboth in that problem and certainly
p690
aVin the perception of that problem.
p691
aVIs that a fair comment?
p692
aa(lp693
VBG: Oh yeah. If you take from the most wealthy
p694
aVand give to the least wealthy, it's good.
p695
aVIt tries to balance out, and that's just.
p696
aa(lp697
VMG: But you change systems.
p698
aVIn the U.S., we're trying to change the education system
p699
aVso it's just for everybody
p700
aVand it works for all students.
p701
aVThat, to me, really changes
p702
aVthe inequality balance.
p703
aa(lp704
VBG: That's the most important.
p705
aV(Applause)
p706
aa(lp707
VCA: Well, I really think that most people here
p708
aVand many millions around the world
p709
aVare just in awe of the trajectory
p710
aVyour lives have taken
p711
aVand the spectacular degree to which
p712
aVyou have shaped the future.
p713
aVThank you so much for coming to TED
p714
aVand for sharing with us and for all you do.
p715
aa(lp716
VBG: Thank you. MG: Thank you.
p717
aV(Applause)

aa(lp719
