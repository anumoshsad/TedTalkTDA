VSome people think that there's a TED Talk formula:
p4
aa(lp5
V"Give a talk on a round, red rug."
p6
aa(lp7
V"Share a childhood story."
p8
aa(lp9
V"Divulge a personal secret."
p10
aa(lp11
V"End with an inspiring call to action."
p12
aa(lp13
VNo.
p14
aVThat's not how to think of a TED Talk.
p15
aVIn fact, if you overuse those devices,
p16
aVyou're just going to come across as clichéd or emotionally manipulative.
p17
aa(lp18
VBut there is one thing that all great TED Talks have in common,
p19
aVand I would like to share that thing with you,
p20
aa(lp21
Vbecause over the past 12 years, I've had a ringside seat,
p22
aVlistening to many hundreds of amazing TED speakers, like these.
p23
aVI've helped them prepare their talks for prime time,
p24
aVand learned directly from them
p25
aVtheir secrets of what makes for a great talk.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd even though these speakers and their topics all seem
p28
aVcompletely different,
p29
aVthey actually do have one key common ingredient.
p30
aVAnd it's this:
p31
aVYour number one task as a speaker
p32
aVis to transfer into your listeners' minds an extraordinary gift \u2014
p33
aVa strange and beautiful object that we call an idea.
p34
aa(lp35
VLet me show you what I mean.
p36
aVHere's Haley.
p37
aVShe is about to give a TED Talk
p38
aVand frankly, she's terrified.
p39
aa(lp40
V(Video) Presenter: Haley Van Dyck!
p41
aa(lp42
V(Applause)
p43
aa(lp44
VOver the course of 18 minutes,
p45
aV1,200 people, many of whom have never seen each other before,
p46
aVare finding that their brains are starting to sync with Haley's brain
p47
aVand with each other.
p48
aVThey're literally beginning to exhibit the same brain-wave patterns.
p49
aVAnd I don't just mean they're feeling the same emotions.
p50
aVThere's something even more startling happening.
p51
aa(lp52
VLet's take a look inside Haley's brain for a moment.
p53
aVThere are billions of interconnected neurons in an impossible tangle.
p54
aVBut look here, right here \u2014
p55
aVa few million of them are linked to each other
p56
aVin a way which represents a single idea.
p57
aVAnd incredibly, this exact pattern is being recreated in real time
p58
aVinside the minds of everyone listening.
p59
aVThat's right; in just a few minutes,
p60
aVa pattern involving millions of neurons
p61
aVis being teleported into 1,200 minds,
p62
aVjust by people listening to a voice and watching a face.
p63
aa(lp64
VBut wait \u2014 what is an idea anyway?
p65
aVWell, you can think of it as a pattern of information
p66
aVthat helps you understand and navigate the world.
p67
aVIdeas come in all shapes and sizes,
p68
aVfrom the complex and analytical
p69
aVto the simple and aesthetic.
p70
aa(lp71
VHere are just a few examples shared from the TED stage.
p72
aVSir Ken Robinson \u2014 creativity is key to our kids' future.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Video) Sir Ken Robinson: My contention is that creativity now
p75
aVis as important in education as literacy,
p76
aVand we should treat it with the same status.
p77
aa(lp78
VChris Anderson: Elora Hardy \u2014 building from bamboo is beautiful.
p79
aa(lp80
V(Video) Elora Hardy: It is growing all around us,
p81
aVit's strong, it's elegant, it's earthquake-resistant.
p82
aa(lp83
VCA: Chimamanda Adichie \u2014 people are more than a single identity.
p84
aa(lp85
V(Video) Chimamanda Adichie: The single story creates stereotypes,
p86
aVand the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue,
p87
aVbut that they are incomplete.
p88
aa(lp89
VCA: Your mind is teeming with ideas,
p90
aVand not just randomly.
p91
aVThey're carefully linked together.
p92
aVCollectively they form an amazingly complex structure
p93
aVthat is your personal worldview.
p94
aVIt's your brain's operating system.
p95
aVIt's how you navigate the world.
p96
aVAnd it is built up out of millions of individual ideas.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo, for example, if one little component of your worldview
p99
aVis the idea that kittens are adorable,
p100
aVthen when you see this,
p101
aVyou'll react like this.
p102
aVBut if another component of your worldview
p103
aVis the idea that leopards are dangerous,
p104
aVthen when you see this,
p105
aVyou'll react a little bit differently.
p106
aVSo, it's pretty obvious
p107
aVwhy the ideas that make up your worldview are crucial.
p108
aVYou need them to be as reliable as possible \u2014 a guide,
p109
aVto the scary but wonderful real world out there.
p110
aa(lp111
VNow, different people's worldviews can be dramatically different.
p112
aVFor example,
p113
aVhow does your worldview react when you see this image:
p114
aa(lp115
V(Video) Dalia Mogahed: What do you think when you look at me?
p116
aV"A woman of faith," "an expert," maybe even "a sister"?
p117
aVOr "oppressed," "brainwashed,"
p118
aV"a terrorist"?
p119
aa(lp120
VCA: Whatever your answer,
p121
aVthere are millions of people out there who would react very differently.
p122
aVSo that's why ideas really matter.
p123
aVIf communicated properly, they're capable of changing, forever,
p124
aVhow someone thinks about the world,
p125
aVand shaping their actions both now and well into the future.
p126
aVIdeas are the most powerful force shaping human culture.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo if you accept
p129
aVthat your number one task as a speaker is to build an idea
p130
aVinside the minds of your audience,
p131
aVhere are four guidelines for how you should go about that task:
p132
aa(lp133
VOne, limit your talk to just one major idea.
p134
aVIdeas are complex things;
p135
aVyou need to slash back your content so that you can focus
p136
aVon the single idea you're most passionate about,
p137
aVand give yourself a chance to explain that one thing properly.
p138
aVYou have to give context, share examples, make it vivid.
p139
aVSo pick one idea,
p140
aVand make it the through-line running through your entire talk,
p141
aVso that everything you say links back to it in some way.
p142
aa(lp143
VTwo, give your listeners a reason to care.
p144
aVBefore you can start building things inside the minds of your audience,
p145
aVyou have to get their permission to welcome you in.
p146
aVAnd the main tool to achieve that?
p147
aVCuriosity.
p148
aVStir your audience's curiosity.
p149
aVUse intriguing, provocative questions
p150
aVto identify why something doesn't make sense and needs explaining.
p151
aVIf you can reveal a disconnection in someone's worldview,
p152
aVthey'll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap.
p153
aVAnd once you've sparked that desire,
p154
aVit will be so much easier to start building your idea.
p155
aa(lp156
VThree, build your idea, piece by piece,
p157
aVout of concepts that your audience already understands.
p158
aVYou use the power of language
p159
aVto weave together concepts that already exist
p160
aVin your listeners' minds \u2014
p161
aVbut not your language, their language.
p162
aVYou start where they are.
p163
aVThe speakers often forget that many of the terms and concepts they live with
p164
aVare completely unfamiliar to their audiences.
p165
aVNow, metaphors can play a crucial role in showing how the pieces fit together,
p166
aVbecause they reveal the desired shape of the pattern,
p167
aVbased on an idea that the listener already understands.
p168
aa(lp169
VFor example, when Jennifer Kahn
p170
aVwanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called CRISPR,
p171
aVshe said, "It's as if, for the first time,
p172
aVyou had a word processor to edit DNA.
p173
aVCRISPR allows you to cut and paste genetic information really easily."
p174
aVNow, a vivid explanation like that delivers a satisfying aha moment
p175
aVas it snaps into place in our minds.
p176
aVIt's important, therefore, to test your talk on trusted friends,
p177
aVand find out which parts they get confused by.
p178
aa(lp179
VFour, here's the final tip:
p180
aVMake your idea worth sharing.
p181
aVBy that I mean, ask yourself the question:
p182
aV"Who does this idea benefit?"
p183
aVAnd I need you to be honest with the answer.
p184
aVIf the idea only serves you or your organization,
p185
aVthen, I'm sorry to say, it's probably not worth sharing.
p186
aVThe audience will see right through you.
p187
aVBut if you believe that the idea has the potential
p188
aVto brighten up someone else's day
p189
aVor change someone else's perspective for the better
p190
aVor inspire someone to do something differently,
p191
aVthen you have the core ingredient to a truly great talk,
p192
aVone that can be a gift to them and to all of us.
