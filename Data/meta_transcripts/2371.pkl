VThis is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement.
p4
aVThis might be the most important sneaker in history.
p5
aVFirst released in 1988,
p6
aVthis is the shoe that started Nike marketing as we know it.
p7
aVThis is the shoe that propelled the entire Air Jordan lineage,
p8
aVand perhaps saved Nike.
p9
aVThe Air Jordan 3 Black Cement did for sneakers
p10
aVwhat the iPhone did for phones.
p11
aVIt's been re-released four times.
p12
aVEvery celebrity's been seen wearing it.
p13
aVThere's a site about what to wear with the Black Cement.
p14
aVIt's been right under your nose for decades
p15
aVand you never looked down.
p16
aVAnd right about now,
p17
aVmost of you are probably thinking, "Sneakers?"
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VYes.
p22
aVYes, sneakers.
p23
aVSome extraordinary things about sneakers
p24
aVand data
p25
aVand Nike
p26
aVand how they're all related, possibly, to the future of all online commerce.
p27
aa(lp28
VIn 2011,
p29
aVthe last time the Jordan 3 Black Cement was released,
p30
aVat a retail of 160 dollars,
p31
aVit sold out globally in minutes.
p32
aVAnd that's because people were camped outside of sneaker stores
p33
aVfor days before it went on sale.
p34
aVAnd just minutes after that,
p35
aVthousands of those pairs were on eBay for two and three times retail.
p36
aVIn fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay right now, four years later.
p37
aVBut here's the thing:
p38
aVthis happens every single Saturday.
p39
aVEvery week there's another release or two or three,
p40
aVand every shoe has a story
p41
aVas rich and compelling as the Jordan 3 Black Cement.
p42
aa(lp43
VThis is Nike building the marketplace for sneakerheads \u2014
p44
aVpeople who collect sneakers \u2014
p45
aVand my daughter.
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
VThat's an "I love Dad" T-shirt.
p50
aa(lp51
VFor the brands, sneakerheads are a very important demographic.
p52
aVThese are the tastemakers; these are the Apple fanboys.
p53
aVBecause who else is going to buy
p54
aVa pair of $8,000 Back to the Future sneakers?
p55
aa(lp56
V(Laughter)
p57
aa(lp58
VYeah, 8,000 dollars.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd while that's obviously the anomaly,
p61
aVthe resell sneaker market is definitely not.
p62
aVThirty years in the making,
p63
aVwhat started as an underground culture
p64
aVof a few people who like sneakers just a bit too much \u2014
p65
aa(lp66
V(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VNow we have sneaker addictions.
p69
aVIn a market where in the past 12 months,
p70
aVthere have been over nine million pairs of shoes
p71
aVresold in the United States alone,
p72
aVat a value of 1.2 billion dollars.
p73
aVAnd that's a conservative estimate \u2014
p74
aVI should know, I am a sneakerhead.
p75
aVThis is my collection.
p76
aVIn the pantheon of great collections, mine doesn't even register.
p77
aVI have about 250 pairs, but trust me, I am small-time.
p78
aVPeople have thousands.
p79
aa(lp80
VI'm a very typical 37-year-old sneakerhead.
p81
aVI grew up playing basketball when Michael Jordan played,
p82
aVI always wanted Air Jordans,
p83
aVmy mother would never buy me Air Jordans,
p84
aVas soon as I got some money I bought Air Jordans \u2014
p85
aVliterally, we all have the exact same story.
p86
aVBut here's where mine diverged.
p87
aVAfter starting three companies, I took a job as a strategy consultant,
p88
aVwhen I very quickly realized that I didn't know the first thing about data.
p89
aVBut I learned, because I had to,
p90
aVand I liked it.
p91
aVSo I thought, I wonder if I could get ahold of some sneaker data,
p92
aVjust to play with for my own amusement.
p93
aVThe goal was to develop a price guide,
p94
aVa real data-driven view of the market.
p95
aVAnd four years later, we're analyzing over 25 million transactions,
p96
aVproviding real-time analytics on thousands of sneakers.
p97
aVNow sneakerheads check prices while camping out for releases.
p98
aVOthers have used the data to validate insurance claims.
p99
aVAnd the top investment banks in the world
p100
aVnow use resell data to analyze the retail footwear industry.
p101
aVAnd here's the best part:
p102
aVsneakerheads have sneaker portfolios.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VSneakerheads can track the value of their collection over time,
p107
aVcompare it to others,
p108
aVand have access to the same analytics you might
p109
aVfor your online brokerage account.
p110
aVSo sneakerhead Dan builds his collection and identifies which 352 are his.
p111
aVHe can see it's worth 103,000 dollars \u2014
p112
aVfrankly, a modest collection.
p113
aVAt the asset level, he can see gain-loss by shoe.
p114
aVHere he's made over 600 dollars on one pair.
p115
aVI have one of those.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VSo an unregulated 1.2 billion dollar industry
p120
aVthat thrives as much on the street as it does online,
p121
aVand has spawned fundamental financial services for sneakers?
p122
aVAt some point I asked myself what's really going on in the market,
p123
aVand two comparisons started to emerge.
p124
aVAre sneakers more like stocks or drugs?
p125
aa(lp126
V(Laughter)
p127
aa(lp128
VIn fact, one guy emailed to say
p129
aVhe thought his 15-year-old son was selling drugs
p130
aVand later found out he was selling sneakers.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VAnd now they use the data to do it together.
p135
aVAnd that's because sneakers are an investment opportunity
p136
aVwhere none other exists.
p137
aVAnd I don't just mean the kid selling sneakers instead of drugs.
p138
aVHow about all kids?
p139
aVYou have to be 18 to play the stock market.
p140
aVI sold chewing gum in sixth grade,
p141
aVBlow Pops in ninth grade
p142
aVand collected baseball cards through high school.
p143
aVThe cards are long dead,
p144
aVand the candy market's usually quite local.
p145
aa(lp146
VFor a lot of people, sneakers are a legal and accessible investment opportunity \u2014
p147
aVa democratized stock market,
p148
aVbut also unregulated.
p149
aVWhich is why the story you're probably most familiar with
p150
aVis people killing each other for sneakers.
p151
aVAnd while that definitely happens and is tragic,
p152
aVit's not nearly the epidemic some media would have you believe.
p153
aVIn fact, it's a very small piece of a much bigger and better story.
p154
aa(lp155
VSo sneakers have clear similarities
p156
aVto both the stock exchange and the illegal drug trade,
p157
aVbut perhaps the most fundamental is the existence of a central actor.
p158
aVSomeone is making the rules.
p159
aVIn the case of sneakers, that someone is Nike.
p160
aa(lp161
VLet me walk you through some numbers.
p162
aa(lp163
VThe resell market, we know, is $1.2 billion.
p164
aVNike, including Jordan brand,
p165
aVaccounts for 96 percent of all shoes sold on the secondary market.
p166
aVJust complete domination.
p167
aVSneakerheads love Jordans.
p168
aVAnd profit on the secondary market is about a third.
p169
aVThat means that sneakerheads made 380 million dollars
p170
aVselling Nikes last year.
p171
aVLet's jump to retail for a second.
p172
aVSkechers, earlier this year,
p173
aVbecame the number two footwear brand in the country,
p174
aVsurpassing Adidas \u2014 this was a big deal.
p175
aVAnd in the 12 months ending in June,
p176
aVSkechers's net income was 209 million dollars.
p177
aVThat means that Nike's customers
p178
aVmake almost twice as much profit as their closest competitor.
p179
aVThat \u2014
p180
aa(lp181
V(Laughter)
p182
aa(lp183
VHow is that even possible?
p184
aa(lp185
VThe sneaker market is just supply and demand,
p186
aVbut Nike's gotten very good at using supply \u2014 limited sneakers \u2014
p187
aVand the distribution of those sneakers to their own benefit.
p188
aVSo it's really just supply.
p189
aVSneakerheads joke that as long as it's limited and Nike, they'll buy it.
p190
aVShoes that sell for 8,000 dollars do so because they're very rare.
p191
aVIt's no different than any other collectible market,
p192
aVonly this isn't a market at all.
p193
aVIt's a false construct created by Nike \u2014
p194
aVingeniously created by Nike, in the most positive sense \u2014 to sell more shoes.
p195
aVAnd in the process,
p196
aVit provided tens of thousands of people with life-long passions,
p197
aVmyself included.
p198
aVIf Nike wanted to kill the resell market, they could do so tomorrow,
p199
aVall they have to do is release more shoes.
p200
aVBut we certainly don't want them to, nor is it in their best interest.
p201
aVThat's because unlike Apple, who will sell an iPhone to anyone who wants one,
p202
aVNike doesn't make their money by just selling $200 sneakers.
p203
aVThey sell millions of shoes to millions of people for 60 dollars.
p204
aVAnd sneakerheads are the ones who drive the marketing
p205
aVand the hype and the PR and the brand cachet,
p206
aVand enable Nike to sell millions of $60 sneakers.
p207
aa(lp208
VIt's marketing.
p209
aVIt's marketing the likes of which has never been seen before \u2014
p210
aVthis isn't in any textbook.
p211
aVFor 15 years Nike has propped up an artificial commodities market,
p212
aVwith a Facebook-level hyped IPO every single weekend.
p213
aVDrive by any Footlocker at 8am on a Saturday morning,
p214
aVand there will be a line down the street and around the block,
p215
aVand sometimes those kids have been waiting there all week.
p216
aVYou know those crazy iPhone lines you see on the news every other year?
p217
aVNike lines happen 104 times more often.
p218
aVSo Nike sets the rules.
p219
aVAnd they do so by controlling supply and distribution.
p220
aa(lp221
VBut once a pair leaves the retail channel, it's the Wild West.
p222
aVThere are very few \u2014 if any \u2014 legal, unregulated markets of this size.
p223
aVSo Nike is definitely not the stock exchange.
p224
aVIn fact, there is no central exchange.
p225
aVBy last count, there were 48 different online markets that I know of.
p226
aVSome are eBay clones, some are mobile markets,
p227
aVand then you have consignment shops and brick-and-mortar stores,
p228
aVand sneaker conventions, and reseller sites,
p229
aVand Facebook and Instagram and Twitter \u2014
p230
aVliterally, anywhere sneakerheads come into contact with each other,
p231
aVshoes will be bought and sold.
p232
aa(lp233
VBut that means no efficiencies, no transparency,
p234
aVsometimes not even authenticity.
p235
aVCan you imagine if that's how stocks were bought?
p236
aVWhat if the way to buy a share of Apple stock
p237
aVwas to search over 100 places online and off,
p238
aVincluding every time you walk down the street
p239
aVjust hoping to pass someone wearing some Apple stock?
p240
aVNever knowing who had the best price,
p241
aVor even if the stock you were looking at was real.
p242
aVThat would surely make you say:
p243
aa(lp244
V[WTF?]
p245
aa(lp246
VOf course that's not how we buy stock.
p247
aVBut what if that's not how we need to buy sneakers either?
p248
aVWhat if the inverse is true,
p249
aVand what if we could buy sneakers
p250
aVexactly the same way as we buy stock?
p251
aVAnd what if it wasn't just sneakers, but any similar product,
p252
aVlike watches and handbags and women's shoes,
p253
aVand any collectible, any seasonal item and any markdown item?
p254
aVWhat if there was a stock market for commerce?
p255
aVA stock market of things.
p256
aVAnd not only could you buy in a much more educated and efficient manner,
p257
aVbut you could engage in all the sophisticated financial transactions
p258
aVyou can with the stock market.
p259
aVShorts and options and futures
p260
aVand well, maybe you see where this is going.
p261
aVMaybe you want to invest in a stock market of things.
p262
aVBecause if you had invested in a pair of Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011,
p263
aVyou could either be wearing them onstage,
p264
aa(lp265
V(Laughter)
p266
aa(lp267
Vor have earned 162 percent on your money \u2014
p268
aVdouble the S&P and 20 percent more than Apple.
p269
aa(lp270
V(Laughter)
p271
aa(lp272
VAnd that's why we're talking about sneakers.
p273
aa(lp274
VThank you.
