VIt's funny the things you forget.
p4
aVI went to see my mother the other day, and she told me this story
p5
aVthat I'd completely forgotten about
p6
aVhow, when we were driving together, she would pull the car over,
p7
aVand by the time she had gotten out of the car,
p8
aVand gone around the car to let me out of the car,
p9
aVI would have already gotten out of the car
p10
aVand pretended to have died.
p11
aa(lp12
V(Laughter)
p13
aa(lp14
V(Applause)
p15
aa(lp16
VBecause that's how you die.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VAnd I remember, that was a game I used to play with myself
p21
aVto entertain myself whenever I was bored or frustrated.
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VSettle down.
p26
aa(lp27
V(Laughter)
p28
aa(lp29
VPeople say we live in an age of information overload. Right?
p30
aVI don't know about that,
p31
aVbut I just know that I get too many marketing emails.
p32
aVI got a marketing email from a supermarket firm,
p33
aVwhich will remain nameless
p34
aVfor predominantly legal reasons,
p35
aVbut which I'm going to call "SafeMart."
p36
aa(lp37
V(Laughter)
p38
aa(lp39
VI got an email from them, and it went like this, it said:
p40
aa(lp41
V"Just three weeks until SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!"
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd I resented this,
p44
aVbecause not only do I not remember signing up to that,
p45
aVbut I resent the fact that they appear to think
p46
aVthat I should be excited about a shop opening.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo what I did was I scrolled down to the bottom of the email,
p49
aVand I pressed, "Unsubscribe."
p50
aVAnd I thought that'd be the end of it.
p51
aVBut a week later, I got another one that said,
p52
aa(lp53
V"Just two weeks
p54
aVuntil SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!"
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd I thought, obviously, I haven't clicked hard enough.
p57
aVSo I tried it again. Right?
p58
aVLo and behold, a week passes, you guessed it,
p59
aa(lp60
V"Just one week until SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!"
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd here's the problem:
p63
aVThe internet gave us access to everything;
p64
aVbut it also gave everything access to us.
p65
aVIt's hard enough to discriminate
p66
aVbetween the things that genuinely matter in this world
p67
aVand the minutiae of life,
p68
aVwithout having emails about supermarket chains
p69
aVand Candy Crush Saga.
p70
aVAnd I was really annoyed with them,
p71
aVand I thought, OK, I was about to write a strongly worded email,
p72
aVwhich I can do quite well.
p73
aa(lp74
V(Laughter)
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd I thought, no \u2014
p77
aVI'm going to find the game.
p78
aVSo I replied to it, and I said,
p79
aa(lp80
V"I literally cannot wait!!!!"
p81
aa(lp82
V(Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
V"What do you need from me?"
p85
aa(lp86
VThey got back to me; a guy called Dan said,
p87
aa(lp88
V"Hi James. I've asked a colleague to help me with your query."
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VLike it needs help.
p93
aVAnd I said, "What's the plan, Dan?
p94
aVI'm thinking fireworks, bouncy castle ..."
p95
aa(lp96
V(Laughter)
p97
aa(lp98
V"I'm not sure what you mean."
p99
aa(lp100
V(Laughter)
p101
aa(lp102
VI said, "I'm just tremendously excited about the opening!"
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
V"Do you want to book the bouncy castle or shall I?"
p107
aa(lp108
VHe said, "I think you have misunderstood."
p109
aa(lp110
V(Laughter)
p111
aa(lp112
V"A new store is opening, but there is no celebration planned."
p113
aa(lp114
VI said, "But what was all the 'Three weeks until,' 'Two weeks until' emails?
p115
aVI was getting excited."
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
V"I'm sorry you're disappointed."
p120
aa(lp121
V(Laughter)
p122
aa(lp123
VI said, "Not to worry.
p124
aVLet's do something anyway!
p125
aVBesides, the deposit on the bouncy castle was non-refundable."
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
V"If we don't use it, we're out a few hundred quid, Dan."
p130
aa(lp131
V(Laughter)
p132
aa(lp133
VHe said, "Mr. Veitch, I'm not responsible for anything you have ordered."
p134
aa(lp135
VI said, "Let's not get into who did what.
p136
aVBottom line: you and I are in this together."
p137
aa(lp138
V(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
V(Applause)
p141
aa(lp142
V"Question: Will you be there to make sure people take their shoes off?"
p143
aa(lp144
V(Laughter)
p145
aa(lp146
VI'll be honest, then my relationship with Dan deteriorated somewhat,
p147
aVbecause the next email I got was this:
p148
aa(lp149
V"Thanks for your email - your Case Number is ..."
p150
aa(lp151
V(Laughter)
p152
aa(lp153
VThat's outrageous.
p154
aVI said, "Dan?"
p155
aa(lp156
V(Laughter)
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd I got \u2014 and I was just like, this is ... \u2014 and I, I ....
p159
aVAnd I said, "Danny?"
p160
aVAnd I thought, this is terrible. All I'm doing is collecting case numbers.
p161
aVI said, "D-Dog?"
p162
aa(lp163
V(Laughter)
p164
aa(lp165
V"The store is now open."
p166
aa(lp167
V(Laughter)
p168
aa(lp169
VI said, "But Dan, they must have wondered why there was no bouncy castle."
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd then we were back to this.
p172
aa(lp173
VAnd that might have been the end of the story,
p174
aVbut I remembered that anything \u2014 everything \u2014
p175
aVeven something as mundane as getting out of a car,
p176
aVcan be fun if you find the right game.
p177
aa(lp178
VSo,
p179
aVthis is what I replied:
p180
aa(lp181
V[Thanks for your email - your Case Number is #0000001.]
p182
aa(lp183
V(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
V(Applause)
p186
aa(lp187
VAnd we just, uh ...
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
VIt was like we were dancing.
p192
aVIt was just a beautiful relationship.
p193
aVWe just kept going.
p194
aVIt was lovely.
p195
aVBut to be honest, guys, it was quite labor-intensive,
p196
aVand I had other stuff to do,
p197
aVbelieve it or not.
p198
aVSo what I did is I have a little email auto-replier program.
p199
aVAnd I set it up so every time it receives an email from SafeMart,
p200
aVit just pings one back.
p201
aVSo I set it up, and it says,
p202
aa(lp203
V"Thanks for your email - your Case Number is ..."
p204
aa(lp205
VThen it has a little formula that I wrote to up the case number every time.
p206
aVAnd I put it on the server
p207
aVand set it running.
p208
aa(lp209
V(Laughter)
p210
aa(lp211
VI'll be honest, guys \u2014
p212
aVthen I forgot about it.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VI checked back on it the other day,
p217
aVand it appears there have been a number of emails going back and forth.
p218
aVWe're on 21,439.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Applause)
p221
aa(lp222
VIt gives me an immense sense of satisfaction to know
p223
aVthat these computer programs are just going to be pinging one another
p224
aVfor eternity.
p225
aVAnd as legacies go, I don't think that's bad.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo guys, just remember:
p228
aVif ever you feel weighed down by the bureaucracy
p229
aVand often mundanity of modern life,
p230
aVdon't fight the frustration.
p231
aVLet it be the catalyst
p232
aVfor whimsy.
p233
aa(lp234
V(Laughter)
p235
aa(lp236
VThank you.
