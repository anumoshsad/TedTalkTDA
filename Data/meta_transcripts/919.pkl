VIn October 2010,
p4
aVthe Justice League of America will be teaming up with The 99.
p5
aVIcons like Batman,
p6
aVSuperman, Wonder Woman and their colleagues
p7
aVwill be teaming up with icons Jabbar, Noora,
p8
aVJami and their colleagues.
p9
aVIt's a story of intercultural intersections,
p10
aVand what better group
p11
aVto have this conversation
p12
aVthan those that grew out of fighting fascism
p13
aVin their respective histories and geographies?
p14
aVAs fascism took over Europe in the 1930s,
p15
aVan unlikely reaction came out of North America.
p16
aVAs Christian iconography got changed,
p17
aVand swastikas were created out of crucifixes,
p18
aVBatman and Superman were created by Jewish young men
p19
aVin the United States and Canada,
p20
aValso going back to the Bible.
p21
aa(lp22
VConsider this:
p23
aVlike the prophets, all the superheroes
p24
aVare missing parents.
p25
aVSuperman's parents die on Krypton
p26
aVbefore the age of one.
p27
aVBruce Wayne, who becomes Batman,
p28
aVloses his parents at the age of six in Gotham City.
p29
aVSpiderman is raised
p30
aVby his aunt and uncle.
p31
aVAnd all of them, just like the prophets who get their message
p32
aVfrom God through Gabriel,
p33
aVget their message from above.
p34
aVPeter Parker is in a library in Manhattan
p35
aVwhen the spider descends from above
p36
aVand gives him his message through a bite.
p37
aVBruce Wayne is in his bedroom
p38
aVwhen a big bat flies over his head,
p39
aVand he sees it as an omen to become Batman.
p40
aVSuperman is not only sent to Earth
p41
aVfrom the heavens, or Krypton,
p42
aVbut he's sent in a pod, much like Moses was on the Nile.
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aVAnd you hear the voice of his father, Jor-El,
p45
aVsaying to Earth, "I have sent to you my only son."
p46
aa(lp47
V(Laughter)
p48
aa(lp49
V(Applause)
p50
aa(lp51
VThese are clearly biblical archetypes,
p52
aVand the thinking behind that was to create
p53
aVpositive, globally-resonating storylines
p54
aVthat could be tied to the same things
p55
aVthat other people were pulling mean messages out of
p56
aVbecause then the person that's using religion for the wrong purpose
p57
aVjust becomes a bad man with a bad message.
p58
aVAnd it's only by linking positive things
p59
aVthat the negative can be delinked.
p60
aVThis is the kind of thinking that went into
p61
aVcreating The 99.
p62
aVThe 99 references the 99 attributes of Allah in the Koran,
p63
aVthings like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom
p64
aVand dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about.
p65
aVIt doesn't matter what your religion is;
p66
aVeven if you're an atheist, you don't raise your kid telling him, you know,
p67
aV"Make sure you lie three times a day."
p68
aVThose are basic human values.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd so the backstory of The 99
p71
aVtakes place in 1258,
p72
aVwhich history tells us the Mongols invaded Baghdad and destroyed it.
p73
aVAll the books from Bait al-Hikma library,
p74
aVthe most famous library in its day, were thrown in the Tigris River,
p75
aVand the Tigris changes color with ink.
p76
aVIt's a story passed on generation after generation.
p77
aVI rewrote that story,
p78
aVand in my version, the librarians find out that this is going to happen \u2014
p79
aVand here's a side note:
p80
aVif you want a comic book to do well, make the librarians the hero. It always works well.
p81
aV(Laughter)
p82
aV(Applause)
p83
aVSo the librarians find out
p84
aVand they get together a special solution, a chemical solution called King's Water,
p85
aVthat when mixed with 99 stones
p86
aVwould be able to save all that culture and history in the books.
p87
aVBut the Mongols get there first.
p88
aVThe books and the solution get thrown in the Tigris River.
p89
aVSome librarians escape, and over the course of days and weeks,
p90
aVthey dip the stones into the Tigris and suck up that collective wisdom
p91
aVthat we all think is lost to civilization.
p92
aa(lp93
VThose stones have been smuggled as three prayer beads
p94
aVof 33 stones each
p95
aVthrough Arabia into Andalusia in Spain, where they're safe for 200 years.
p96
aVBut in 1492, two important things happen.
p97
aVThe first is the fall of Granada,
p98
aVthe last Muslim enclave in Europe.
p99
aVThe second is Columbus finally gets funded to go to India, but he gets lost.
p100
aV(Laughter)
p101
aVSo 33 of the stones are smuggled
p102
aVonto the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria
p103
aVand are spread in the New World.
p104
aVThirty-three go on the Silk Road to China, South Asia and Southeast Asia.
p105
aVAnd 33 are spread between Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd now it's 2010, and there are 99 heroes
p108
aVfrom 99 different countries.
p109
aVNow it's very easy to assume
p110
aVthat those books, because they were from a library called Bait al-Hikma, were Muslim books,
p111
aVbut that's not the case because the caliph that built that library,
p112
aVhis name was al-Ma'mun \u2014 he was Harun al-Rashid's son.
p113
aVHe had told his advisers, "Get me all the scholars
p114
aVto translate any book they can get their hands onto into Arabic,
p115
aVand I will pay them its weight in gold."
p116
aVAfter a while, his advisers complained.
p117
aVThey said, "Your Highness, the scholars are cheating.
p118
aVThey're writing in big handwriting to take more gold."
p119
aVTo which he said, "Let them be, because what they're giving us
p120
aVis worth a lot more than what we're paying them."
p121
aVSo the idea of an open architecture, an open knowledge,
p122
aVis not new to my neck of the desert.
p123
aa(lp124
VThe concept centers on something called the Noor stones.
p125
aVNoor is Arabic for light.
p126
aVSo these 99 stones, a few kind of rules in the game:
p127
aVNumber one, you don't choose the stone; the stone chooses you.
p128
aVThere's a King Arthur element to the storyline, okay.
p129
aVNumber two, all of The 99,
p130
aVwhen they first get their stone, or their power, abuse it;
p131
aVthey use it for self-interest.
p132
aVAnd there's a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone,
p133
aVyou get taken advantage of
p134
aVby people who will exploit your powers, okay.
p135
aVNumber three, the 99 stones all have within them
p136
aVa mechanism that self-updates.
p137
aa(lp138
VNow there are two groups that exist within the Muslim world.
p139
aVEverybody believes the Koran is for all time and all place.
p140
aVSome believe that means that the original interpretation
p141
aVfrom a couple thousand years ago is what's relevant today.
p142
aVI don't belong there.
p143
aVThen there's a group that believes the Koran is a living, breathing document,
p144
aVand I captured that idea within these stones that self-update.
p145
aVNow the main bad guy, Rughal,
p146
aVdoes not want these stones to update,
p147
aVso he's trying to get them to stop updating.
p148
aVHe can't use the stones, but he can stop them.
p149
aVAnd by stopping them, he has more of a fascist agenda,
p150
aVwhere he gets some of The 99 to work for him \u2014
p151
aVthey're all wearing cookie-cutter, same color uniforms
p152
aVThey're not allowed to individually express who they are and what they are.
p153
aVAnd he controls them from the top down \u2014
p154
aVwhereas when they work for the other side, eventually,
p155
aVwhen they find out this is the wrong person, they've been manipulated,
p156
aVthey actually, each one has a different, colorful
p157
aVkind of dress.
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd the last point about the 99 Noor stones is this.
p160
aVSo The 99 work in teams of three.
p161
aVWhy three? A couple of reasons.
p162
aVNumber one, we have a thing within Islam that you don't leave a boy and a girl alone together,
p163
aVbecause the third person is temptation or the devil, right?
p164
aVI think that's there in all cultures, right?
p165
aVBut this is not about religion, it's not about proselytizing.
p166
aVThere's this very strong social message
p167
aVthat needs to get to kind of
p168
aVthe deepest crevices of intolerance,
p169
aVand the only way to get there is to kind of play the game.
p170
aVAnd so this is the way I dealt with it.
p171
aVThey work in teams of three: two boys and a girl, two girls and a boy,
p172
aVthree boys, three girls, no problem.
p173
aVAnd the Swiss psychoanalyst, Carl Jung, also spoke about
p174
aVthe importance of the number three in all cultures, so I figure I'm covered.
p175
aVWell ...
p176
aVI got accused in a few blogs that I was actually sent by the Pope
p177
aVto preach the Trinity and Catholicism in the Middle East,
p178
aVso you \u2014 (Laughter)
p179
aVyou believe who you want. I gave you my version of the story.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo here's some of the characters that we have.
p182
aVMujiba, from Malaysia: her main power is she's able to answer any question.
p183
aVShe's the Trivial Pursuit queen, if you want,
p184
aVbut when she first gets her power,
p185
aVshe starts going on game shows and making money.
p186
aVWe have Jabbar from Saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power.
p187
aVNow, Mumita was a fun one to name. Mumita is the destroyer.
p188
aVSo the 99 attributes of Allah have the yin and the yang;
p189
aVthere's the powerful, the hegemonous, the strong,
p190
aVand there's also the kind, the generous.
p191
aVI'm like, are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong?
p192
aVI'm like, you know what, I've met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime, so ...
p193
aV(Laughter)
p194
aVWe have Jami from Hungary, who first starts making weapons:
p195
aVHe's the technology wiz.
p196
aVMusawwira from Ghana,
p197
aVHadya from Pakistan, Jaleel from Iran who uses fire.
p198
aVAnd this is one of my favorites, Al-Batina from Yemen.
p199
aVAl-Batina is the hidden.
p200
aVSo Al-Batina is hidden, but she's a superhero.
p201
aVI came home to my wife and I said, "I created a character after you."
p202
aVMy wife is a Saudi from Yemeni roots.
p203
aVAnd she said, "Show me." So I showed this.
p204
aVShe said, "That's not me."
p205
aVI said, "Look at the eyes. They're your eyes."
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VSo I promised my investors this would not be another made-in-fifth-world-country production.
p210
aVThis was going to be Superman, or it wasn't worth my time or their money.
p211
aVSo from day one, the people involved in the project,
p212
aVbottom left is Fabian Nicieza,
p213
aVwriter for X-Men and Power Rangers.
p214
aVNext to him is Dan Panosian,
p215
aVone of the character creators for the modern-day X-Men.
p216
aVTop right is Stuart Moore, a writer for Iron Man.
p217
aVNext to him is John McCrea, who was an inker for Spiderman.
p218
aVAnd we entered Western consciousness
p219
aVwith a tagline: "Next Ramadan, the world will have new heroes,"
p220
aVback in 2005.
p221
aa(lp222
VNow I went to Dubai, to an Arab Thought Foundation Conference,
p223
aVand I was waiting by the coffee for the right journalist.
p224
aVDidn't have a product, but had energy.
p225
aVAnd I found somebody from The New York Times,
p226
aVand I cornered him, and I pitched him.
p227
aVAnd I think I scared him \u2014 (Laughter)
p228
aVbecause he basically promised me \u2014
p229
aVwe had no product \u2014 but he said, "We'll give you a paragraph in the arts section
p230
aVif you'll just go away."
p231
aV(Laughter)
p232
aVSo I said, "Great." So I called him up a few weeks afterward.
p233
aVI said, "Hi, Hesa." And he said, "Hi." I said, "Happy New Year."
p234
aVHe said, "Thank you. We had a baby." I said, "Congratulations."
p235
aVLike I care, right?
p236
aV"So when's the article coming out?"
p237
aVHe said, "Naif, Islam and cartoon?
p238
aVThat's not timely.
p239
aVYou know, maybe next week, next month, next year, but, you know, it'll come out."
p240
aVSo a few days after that, what happens?
p241
aVWhat happens is the world erupts in the Danish cartoon controversy.
p242
aVI became timely.
p243
aV(Laughter)
p244
aVSo flurry of phone calls and emails from The New York Times.
p245
aVNext thing you knew, there's a full page covering us positively,
p246
aVJanuary 22nd, 2006,
p247
aVwhich changed our lives forever,
p248
aVbecause anybody Googling Islam and cartoon or Islam and comic,
p249
aVguess what they got; they got me.
p250
aa(lp251
VAnd The 99 were like superheroes
p252
aVkind of flying out of what was happening around the world.
p253
aVAnd that led to all kinds of things,
p254
aVfrom being in curricula in universities and schools to \u2014
p255
aVone of my favorite pictures I have from South Asia,
p256
aVit was a couple of men with long beards
p257
aVand a lot of girls wearing the hijab \u2014 it looked like a school.
p258
aVThe good news is they're all holding copies of The 99, smiling,
p259
aVand they found me to sign the picture.
p260
aVThe bad news is they were all photocopies, so we didn't make a dime in revenue.
p261
aV(Laughter)
p262
aVWe've been able to license The 99 comic books
p263
aVinto eight languages so far \u2014
p264
aVChinese, Indonesian, Hindi, Urdu, Turkish.
p265
aVOpened a theme park through a license in Kuwait a year and a half ago
p266
aVcalled The 99 Village Theme Park \u2014
p267
aV300,000 square feet, 20 rides, all with our characters:
p268
aVa couple back-to-school licenses in Spain and Turkey.
p269
aa(lp270
VBut the biggest thing we've done to date, which is just amazing,
p271
aVis that we've done a 26-episode animated series,
p272
aVwhich is done for global audiences:
p273
aVin fact, we're already going to be in the U.S. and Turkey, we know.
p274
aVIt's 3D CGI, which is going to be very high-quality,
p275
aVwritten in Hollywood by the writers behind Ben 10
p276
aVand Spiderman and Star Wars: Clone Wars.
p277
aVIn this clip I'm about to show you, which has never been seen in the public before,
p278
aVthere is a struggle.
p279
aVTwo of the characters, Jabbar, the one with the muscles,
p280
aVand Noora, the one that can use light,
p281
aVare actually wearing the cookie-cutter fascist gray uniform
p282
aVbecause they're being manipulated.
p283
aVThey don't know, OK,
p284
aVand they're trying to get another member of The 99 to join them.
p285
aVSo there's a struggle within the team.
p286
aVSo if we can get the lights ...
p287
aa(lp288
V["The 99"]
p289
aa(lp290
VJabbar: Dana, I can't see where to grab hold.
p291
aVI need more light.
p292
aa(lp293
VWhat's happening?
p294
aa(lp295
VDana: There's too much darkness.
p296
aa(lp297
VRughal: There must be something we can do.
p298
aa(lp299
VMan: I won't send any more commandos in
p300
aVuntil I know it's safe.
p301
aa(lp302
VDr. Razem: It's time to go, Miklos.
p303
aa(lp304
VMiklos: Must download file contents.
p305
aVI can't forget auntie.
p306
aa(lp307
VJabbar: Dana, I can't do this without you.
p308
aa(lp309
VDana: But I can't help.
p310
aa(lp311
VJabbar: You can,
p312
aVeven if you don't believe in yourself right now.
p313
aVI believe in you.
p314
aVYou are Noora the Light.
p315
aa(lp316
VDana: No.
p317
aVI don't deserve it. I don't deserve anything.
p318
aa(lp319
VJabbar: Then what about the rest of us?
p320
aVDon't we deserve to be saved? Don't I?
p321
aVNow, tell me which way to go.
p322
aa(lp323
VDana: That way.
p324
aa(lp325
VAlarm: Threat imminent.
p326
aa(lp327
VJabbar: Aaaahhh!
p328
aa(lp329
VMiklos: Stay away from me.
p330
aa(lp331
VJabbar: We're here to help you.
p332
aa(lp333
VDr. Razem: Don't listen to them.
p334
aa(lp335
VDana: Miklos, that man is not your friend.
p336
aa(lp337
VMiklos: No. He gave me access,
p338
aVand you want to reboot the [unclear]. No more [unclear].
p339
aa(lp340
V["The 99"]
p341
aa(lp342
VThank you.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Applause)
p345
aa(lp346
VSo "The 99" is technology; it's entertainment;
p347
aVit's design.
p348
aVBut that's only half the story.
p349
aVAs the father of five sons,
p350
aVI worry about who they're going to be using as role models.
p351
aVI worry because all around me, even within my extended family,
p352
aVI see religion being manipulated.
p353
aVAs a psychologist, I worry
p354
aVfor the world in general,
p355
aVbut worry about the perception of how people see themselves
p356
aVin my part of the world.
p357
aVNow, I'm a clinical psychologist. I'm licensed in New York State.
p358
aVI trained at Bellevue Hospital Survivors of Political Torture Program,
p359
aVand I heard one too many stories of people growing up
p360
aVto idolize their leadership,
p361
aVonly to end up being tortured by their heroes.
p362
aVAnd torture's a terrible enough thing as it is, but when it's done by your hero,
p363
aVthat just breaks you in so many ways.
p364
aVI left Bellevue, went to business school and started this.
p365
aa(lp366
VNow, one of the things that I refer to
p367
aVwhen I \u2014 about the importance of this message \u2014
p368
aVis that I gave a lecture at the medical school at Kuwait University,
p369
aVwhere I lecture on the biological basis of behavior,
p370
aVand I gave the students two articles, one from The New York Times
p371
aVand one from New York magazine.
p372
aVAnd I took away the name of the writer, the name of the [unclear] \u2014 everything was gone except the facts.
p373
aVAnd the first one was about a group called The Party of God,
p374
aVwho wanted to ban Valentine's Day. Red was made illegal.
p375
aVAny boys and girls caught flirting
p376
aVwould get married off immediately, okay.
p377
aVThe second one was about a woman complaining
p378
aVbecause three minivans with six bearded men pulled up
p379
aVand started interrogating her on the spot
p380
aVfor talking to a man who wasn't related to her.
p381
aa(lp382
VAnd I asked the students in Kuwait where they thought these incidents took place.
p383
aVThe first one, they said Saudi Arabia. There was no debate.
p384
aVThe second one, they were actually split
p385
aVbetween Saudi and Afghanistan.
p386
aVWhat blew their mind was the first one took place in India,
p387
aVit was the party of a Hindu God.
p388
aVThe second one took place in upstate New York.
p389
aVIt was an Orthodox Jewish community.
p390
aVBut what breaks my heart and what's alarming
p391
aVis that in those two interviews,
p392
aVthe people around, who were interviewed as well,
p393
aVrefer to that behavior as Talibanization.
p394
aVIn other words, good Hindus and good Jews don't act this way.
p395
aVThis is Islam's influence on Hinduism and Judaism.
p396
aVBut what do the students in Kuwait say? They said it's us \u2014
p397
aVand this is dangerous.
p398
aVIt's dangerous when a group self-identifies itself
p399
aVas extreme.
p400
aa(lp401
VThis is one of my sons, Rayan,
p402
aVwho's a Scooby Doo addict.
p403
aVYou can tell by the glasses there.
p404
aVHe actually called me a meddling kid the other day.
p405
aV(Laughter)
p406
aVBut I borrow a lesson that I learned from him.
p407
aVLast summer when we were in our home in New York,
p408
aVhe was out in the yard playing in his playhouse. And I was in my office working,
p409
aVand he came in, "Baba, I want you to come with me. I want my toy."
p410
aV"Yes, Rayan, just go away." He left his Scooby Doo in his house.
p411
aVI said, "Go away. I'm working. I'm busy."
p412
aVAnd what Rayan did then
p413
aVis he sat there, he tapped his foot on the floor, at three and a half,
p414
aVand he looked at me and he said, "Baba,
p415
aVI want you to come with me to my office in my house.
p416
aVI have work to do."
p417
aV(Laughter)
p418
aV(Applause)
p419
aVRayan reframed the situation
p420
aVand brought himself down to my level.
p421
aa(lp422
V(Laughter)
p423
aa(lp424
VAnd with The 99, that is what we aim to do.
p425
aVYou know, I think that there's a big parallel
p426
aVbetween bending the crucifix out of shape
p427
aVand creating swastikas.
p428
aVAnd when I see pictures like this, of parents or uncles
p429
aVwho think it's cute to have a little child
p430

VAs an undergrad at Tufts University, we were giving away free falafel one day
p442
aVand, you know, it was Middle East Day or something.
p443
aVAnd people came up and picked up
p444
aVthe culturally resonant image of the falafel,
p445
aVate it and, you know, talked and left.
p446
aVAnd no two people could disagree about what the word free was
p447
aVand what the word falafel was, behind us, "free falafel." You know.

aVand where religion can be twisted
