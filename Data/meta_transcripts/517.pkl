VThis is Tim Ferriss circa 1979 A.D. Age two.
p4
aVYou can tell by the power squat, I was a very confident boy \u2014
p5
aVand not without reason.
p6
aVI had a very charming routine at the time,
p7
aVwhich was to wait until late in the evening
p8
aVwhen my parents were decompressing from a hard day's work,
p9
aVdoing their crossword puzzles, watching television.
p10
aVI would run into the living room, jump up on the couch,
p11
aVrip the cushions off, throw them on the floor,
p12
aVscream at the top of my lungs and run out
p13
aVbecause I was the Incredible Hulk.
p14
aV(Laughter)
p15
aVObviously, you see the resemblance.
p16
aVAnd this routine went on for some time.
p17
aa(lp18
VWhen I was seven I went to summer camp.
p19
aVMy parents found it necessary for peace of mind.
p20
aVAnd at noon each day
p21
aVthe campers would go to a pond,
p22
aVwhere they had floating docks.
p23
aVYou could jump off the end into the deep end.
p24
aVI was born premature. I was always very small.
p25
aVMy left lung had collapsed when I was born.
p26
aVAnd I've always had buoyancy problems.
p27
aVSo water was something that scared me to begin with.
p28
aVBut I would go in on occasion.
p29
aVAnd on one particular day,
p30
aVthe campers were jumping through inner tubes,
p31
aVThey were diving through inner tubes. And I thought this would be great fun.
p32
aVSo I dove through the inner tube,
p33
aVand the bully of the camp grabbed my ankles.
p34
aVAnd I tried to come up for air,
p35
aVand my lower back hit the bottom of the inner tube.
p36
aVAnd I went wild eyed and thought I was going to die.
p37
aVA camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us.
p38
aVFrom that point onward I was terrified of swimming.
p39
aVThat is something that I did not get over.
p40
aVMy inability to swim has been
p41
aVone of my greatest humiliations and embarrassments.
p42
aVThat is when I realized that I was not the Incredible Hulk.
p43
aa(lp44
VBut there is a happy ending to this story.
p45
aVAt age 31 \u2014 that's my age now \u2014
p46
aVin August I took two weeks to re-examine swimming,
p47
aVand question all the of the obvious aspects of swimming.
p48
aVAnd went from swimming one lap \u2014
p49
aVso 20 yards \u2014 like a drowning monkey,
p50
aVat about 200 beats per minute heart rate \u2014
p51
aVI measured it \u2014
p52
aVto going to Montauk on Long Island,
p53
aVclose to where I grew up,
p54
aVand jumping into the ocean and swimming one kilometer in open water,
p55
aVgetting out and feeling better than when I went in.
p56
aVAnd I came out,
p57
aVin my Speedos, European style,
p58
aVfeeling like the Incredible Hulk.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd that's what I want everyone in here to feel like,
p61
aVthe Incredible Hulk, at the end of this presentation.
p62
aVMore specifically, I want you to feel like you're capable
p63
aVof becoming an excellent long-distance swimmer,
p64
aVa world-class language learner,
p65
aVand a tango champion.
p66
aVAnd I would like to share my art.
p67
aVIf I have an art, it's deconstructing things
p68
aVthat really scare the living hell out of me.
p69
aVSo, moving onward.
p70
aa(lp71
VSwimming, first principles.
p72
aVFirst principles, this is very important.
p73
aVI find that the best results in life
p74
aVare often held back by false constructs and untested assumptions.
p75
aVAnd the turnaround in swimming came
p76
aVwhen a friend of mine said, "I will go a year without any stimulants" \u2014
p77
aVthis is a six-double-espresso-per-day type of guy \u2014
p78
aV"if you can complete a one kilometer open water race."
p79
aVSo the clock started ticking.
p80
aVI started seeking out triathletes
p81
aVbecause I found that lifelong swimmers often couldn't teach what they did.
p82
aVI tried kickboards.
p83
aVMy feet would slice through the water like razors,
p84
aVI wouldn't even move. I would leave demoralized, staring at my feet.
p85
aVHand paddles, everything.
p86
aVEven did lessons with Olympians \u2014 nothing helped.
p87
aVAnd then Chris Sacca, who is now a dear friend mine,
p88
aVhad completed an Iron Man with 103 degree temperature,
p89
aVsaid, "I have the answer to your prayers."
p90
aVAnd he introduced me to
p91
aVthe work of a man named Terry Laughlin
p92
aVwho is the founder of Total Immersion Swimming.
p93
aVThat set me on the road to examining biomechanics.
p94
aa(lp95
VSo here are the new rules of swimming,
p96
aVif any of you are afraid of swimming, or not good at it.
p97
aVThe first is, forget about kicking. Very counterintuitive.
p98
aVSo it turns out that propulsion isn't really the problem.
p99
aVKicking harder doesn't solve the problem
p100
aVbecause the average swimmer only transfers about three percent
p101
aVof their energy expenditure into forward motion.
p102
aVThe problem is hydrodynamics.
p103
aVSo what you want to focus on instead
p104
aVis allowing your lower body to draft behind your upper body,
p105
aVmuch like a small car behind a big car on the highway.
p106
aVAnd you do that by maintaining a horizontal body position.
p107
aVThe only way you can do that
p108
aVis to not swim on top of the water.
p109
aVThe body is denser than water. 95 percent of it would be,
p110
aVat least, submerged naturally.
p111
aa(lp112
VSo you end up, number three,
p113
aVnot swimming, in the case of freestyle,
p114
aVon your stomach, as many people think, reaching on top of the water.
p115
aVBut actually rotating from streamlined right
p116
aVto streamlined left,
p117
aVmaintaining that fuselage position as long as possible.
p118
aVSo let's look at some examples. This is Terry.
p119
aVAnd you can see that he's extending his right arm
p120
aVbelow his head and far in front.
p121
aVAnd so his entire body really is underwater.
p122
aVThe arm is extended below the head.
p123
aVThe head is held in line with the spine,
p124
aVso that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up \u2014
p125
aVvery important, especially for people with lower body fat.
p126
aVHere is an example of the stroke.
p127
aVSo you don't kick. But you do use a small flick.
p128
aVYou can see this is the left extension.
p129
aVThen you see his left leg.
p130
aVSmall flick, and the only purpose of that
p131
aVis to rotate his hips so he can get to the opposite side.
p132
aVAnd the entry point for his right hand \u2014 notice this,
p133
aVhe's not reaching in front and catching the water.
p134
aVRather, he is entering the water
p135
aVat a 45-degree angle with his forearm,
p136
aVand then propelling himself by streamlining \u2014 very important.
p137
aVIncorrect, above, which is what almost every swimming coach will teach you.
p138
aVNot their fault, honestly.
p139
aVAnd I'll get to implicit versus explicit in a moment.
p140
aVBelow is what most swimmers
p141
aVwill find enables them to do what I did,
p142
aVwhich is going from 21 strokes per 20-yard length
p143
aVto 11 strokes
p144
aVin two workouts with no coach, no video monitoring.
p145
aVAnd now I love swimming. I can't wait to go swimming.
p146
aVI'll be doing a swimming lesson later, for myself, if anyone wants to join me.
p147
aa(lp148
VLast thing, breathing. A problem a lot of us have, certainly, when you're swimming.
p149
aVIn freestyle, easiest way to remedy this is
p150
aVto turn with body roll,
p151
aVand just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water.
p152
aVAnd that will get you very far.
p153
aVThat's it. That's really all you need to know.
p154
aa(lp155
VLanguages. Material versus method.
p156
aVI, like many people, came to the conclusion
p157
aVthat I was terrible at languages.
p158
aVI suffered through Spanish for junior high, first year of high school,
p159
aVand the sum total of my knowledge
p160
aVwas pretty much, "Donde esta el bano?"
p161
aVAnd I wouldn't even catch the response. A sad state of affairs.
p162
aVThen I transferred to a different school sophomore year, and
p163
aVI had a choice of other languages. Most of my friends were taking Japanese.
p164
aVSo I thought why not punish myself? I'll do Japanese.
p165
aVSix months later I had the chance to go to Japan.
p166
aVMy teachers assured me, they said, "Don't worry.
p167
aVYou'll have Japanese language classes every day to help you cope.
p168
aVIt will be an amazing experience." My first overseas experience in fact.
p169
aVSo my parents encouraged me to do it. I left.
p170
aa(lp171
VI arrived in Tokyo. Amazing.
p172
aVI couldn't believe I was on the other side of the world.
p173
aVI met my host family. Things went quite well I think,
p174
aVall things considered.
p175
aVMy first evening, before my first day of school,
p176
aVI said to my mother, very politely,
p177
aV"Please wake me up at eight a.m."
p178
aVSo, (Japanese)
p179
aVBut I didn't say (Japanese). I said, (Japanese). Pretty close.
p180
aVBut I said, "Please rape me at eight a.m."
p181
aV(Laughter)
p182
aVYou've never seen a more confused Japanese woman.
p183
aV(Laughter)
p184
aa(lp185
VI walked in to school.
p186
aVAnd a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper.
p187
aVI couldn't read any of it \u2014 hieroglyphics, it could have been \u2014
p188
aVbecause it was Kanji,
p189
aVChinese characters adapted into the Japanese language.
p190
aVAsked him what this said.
p191
aVAnd he goes, "Ahh, okay okay,
p192
aVeehto, World History, ehh, Calculus,
p193
aVTraditional Japanese." And so on.
p194
aVAnd so it came to me in waves.
p195
aVThere had been something lost in translation.
p196
aVThe Japanese classes were not Japanese instruction classes, per se.
p197
aVThey were the normal high school curriculum for Japanese students \u2014
p198
aVthe other 4,999 students in the school, who were Japanese, besides the American.
p199
aVAnd that's pretty much my response.
p200
aV(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd that set me on this panic driven search for the perfect language method.
p203
aVI tried everything. I went to Kinokuniya.
p204
aVI tried every possible book, every possible CD.
p205
aVNothing worked until I found this.
p206
aVThis is the Joyo Kanji. This is a Tablet rather,
p207
aVor a poster of the 1,945 common-use characters
p208
aVas determined by the Ministry of Education in 1981.
p209
aVMany of the publications in Japan limit themselves to these characters,
p210
aVto facilitate literacy \u2014 some are required to.
p211
aVAnd this became my Holy Grail, my Rosetta Stone.
p212
aa(lp213
VAs soon as I focused on this material,
p214
aVI took off.
p215
aVI ended up being able to read Asahi Shinbu, Asahi newspaper,
p216
aVabout six months later \u2014 so a total of 11 months later \u2014
p217
aVand went from Japanese I to Japanese VI.
p218
aVEnded up doing translation work at age 16 when I returned to the U.S.,
p219
aVand have continued to apply this material
p220
aVover method approach to close to a dozen languages now.
p221
aVSomeone who was terrible at languages,
p222
aVand at any given time, speak, read and write five or six.
p223
aVThis brings us to the point,
p224
aVwhich is, it's oftentimes what you do,
p225
aVnot how you do it, that is the determining factor.
p226
aVThis is the difference between being effective \u2014 doing the right things \u2014
p227
aVand being efficient \u2014 doing things well whether or not they're important.
p228
aa(lp229
VYou can also do this with grammar.
p230
aVI came up with these six sentences after much experimentation.
p231
aVHaving a native speaker allow you to deconstruct their grammar,
p232
aVby translating these sentences into past, present, future,
p233
aVwill show you subject, object, verb,
p234
aVplacement of indirect, direct objects, gender and so forth.
p235
aVFrom that point, you can then, if you want to,
p236
aVacquire multiple languages, alternate them so there is no interference.
p237
aVWe can talk about that if anyone in interested.
p238
aVAnd now I love languages.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo ballroom dancing, implicit versus explicit \u2014
p241
aVvery important.
p242
aVYou might look at me and say, "That guy must be a ballroom dancer."
p243
aVBut no, you'd be wrong
p244
aVbecause my body is very poorly designed for most things \u2014
p245
aVpretty well designed for lifting heavy rocks perhaps.
p246
aVI used to be much bigger, much more muscular.
p247
aVAnd so I ended up walking like this.
p248
aVI looked a lot like an orangutan, our close cousins, or the Incredible Hulk.
p249
aVNot very good for ballroom dancing.
p250
aa(lp251
VI found myself in Argentina in 2005,
p252
aVdecided to watch a tango class \u2014 had no intention of participating.
p253
aVWent in, paid my ten pesos,
p254
aVwalked up \u2014 10 women two guys, usually a good ratio.
p255
aVThe instructor says, "You are participating."
p256
aVImmediately: death sweat.
p257
aV(Laughter)
p258
aVFight-or-flight fear sweat, because I tried ballroom dancing in college \u2014
p259
aVstepped on the girl's foot with my heel. She screamed.
p260
aVI was so concerned with her perception of what I was doing,
p261
aVthat it exploded in my face,
p262
aVnever to return to the ballroom dancing club.
p263
aVShe comes up, and this was her approach, the teacher.
p264
aV"Okay, come on, grab me."
p265
aVGorgeous assistant instructor.
p266
aVShe was very pissed off that I had pulled her from her advanced practice.
p267
aVSo I did my best. I didn't know where to put my hands.
p268
aVAnd she pulled back, threw down her arms,
p269
aVput them on her hips, turned around and yelled across the room,
p270
aV"This guy is built like a god-damned mountain of muscle,
p271
aVand he's grabbing me like a fucking Frenchman,"
p272
aV(Laughter)
p273
aVwhich I found encouraging.
p274
aV(Laughter)
p275
aVEveryone burst into laughter. I was humiliated.
p276
aVShe came back. She goes, "Come on. I don't have all day."
p277
aVAs someone who wrestled since age eight, I proceeded to crush her,
p278
aV"Of Mice and Men" style.
p279
aVAnd she looked up and said,
p280
aV"Now that's better."
p281
aVSo I bought a month's worth of classes.
p282
aV(Laughter)
p283
aa(lp284
VAnd proceeded to look at \u2014
p285
aVI wanted to set competition so I'd have a deadline \u2014
p286
aVParkinson's Law,
p287
aVthe perceived complexity of a task will expand to fill the time you allot it.
p288
aVSo I had a very short deadline for a competition.
p289
aVI got a female instructor first,
p290
aVto teach me the female role, the follow,
p291
aVbecause I wanted to understand the sensitivities and abilities
p292
aVthat the follow needed to develop, so I wouldn't have a repeat of college.
p293
aVAnd then I took an inventory of the characteristics,
p294
aValong with her, of the
p295
aVof the capabilities and elements of different dancers who'd won championships.
p296
aVI interviewed these people because they all taught in Buenos Aires.
p297
aVI compared the two lists,
p298
aVand what you find is that there is explicitly,
p299
aVexpertise they recommended, certain training methods.
p300
aVThen there were implicit commonalities
p301
aVthat none of them seemed to be practicing.
p302
aVNow the protectionism of Argentine dance teachers aside,
p303
aVI found this very interesting. So I decided to focus on three of those commonalities.
p304
aVLong steps. So a lot of milongueros \u2014
p305
aVthe tango dancers will use very short steps.
p306
aVI found that longer steps were much more elegant.
p307
aVSo you can have \u2014
p308
aVand you can do it in a very small space in fact.
p309
aVSecondly, different types of pivots.
p310
aVThirdly, variation in tempo.
p311
aVThese seemed to be the three areas that I could exploit to compete
p312
aVif I wanted to comptete against people who'd been practicing for 20 to 30 years.
p313
aa(lp314
VThat photo is of the
p315
aVsemi-finals of the Buenos Aires championships, four months later.
p316
aVThen one month later, went to the world championships,
p317
aVmade it to the semi-final. And then set a world record, following that,
p318
aVtwo weeks later.
p319
aVI want you to see part of what I practiced.
p320
aVI'm going to jump forward here.
p321
aVThis is the instructor that Alicia and I chose for the male lead.
p322
aVHis name is Gabriel Misse.
p323
aVOne of the most elegant dancers of his generation,
p324
aVknown for his long steps, and his tempo changes
p325
aVand his pivots.
p326
aVAlicia, in her own right, very famous.
p327
aVSo I think you'll agree, they look quite good together.
p328
aVNow what I like about this video
p329
aVis it's actually a video of the first time they ever danced together
p330
aVbecause of his lead. He had a strong lead.
p331
aVHe didn't lead with his chest, which requires you lean forward.
p332
aVI couldn't develop the attributes in my toes,
p333
aVthe strength in my feet, to do that.
p334
aVSo he uses a lead that focuses on
p335
aVhis shoulder girdle and his arm.
p336
aVSo he can lift the woman to break her, for example.
p337
aVThat's just one benefit of that.
p338
aVSo then we broke it down.
p339
aVThis would be an example of one pivot.
p340
aVThis is a back step pivot.
p341
aVThere are many different types.
p342
aVI have hundreds of hours of footage \u2014
p343
aVall categorized, much like George Carlin
p344
aVcategorized his comedy.
p345
aVSo using my arch-nemesis,
p346
aVSpanish, no less, to learn tango.
p347
aa(lp348
VSo fear is your friend. Fear is an indicator.
p349
aVSometimes it shows you what you shouldn't do.
p350
aVMore often than not it shows you exactly what you should do.
p351
aVAnd the best results that I've had in life,
p352
aVthe most enjoyable times, have all been from asking a simple question:
p353
aVwhat's the worst that can happen?
p354
aVEspecially with fears you gained when you were a child.
p355
aVTake the analytical frameworks,
p356
aVthe capabilities you have, apply them to old fears.
p357
aVApply them to very big dreams.
p358
aa(lp359
VAnd when I think of what I fear now, it's very simple.
p360
aVWhen I imagine my life,
p361
aVwhat my life would have been like
p362
aVwithout the educational opportunities that I had,
p363
aVit makes me wonder.
p364
aVI've spent the last two years trying to deconstruct
p365
aVthe American public school system,
p366
aVto either fix it or replace it.
p367
aVAnd have done experiments with about 50,000 students thus far \u2014
p368
aVbuilt, I'd say, about a half dozen schools,
p369
aVmy readers, at this point.
p370
aVAnd if any of you are interested in that,
p371
aVI would love to speak with you.
p372
aVI know nothing. I'm a beginner.
p373
aVBut I ask a lot of questions, and I would love your advice.
p374
aVThank you very much.
