VIf I asked you to picture the air,
p4
aVwhat do you imagine?
p5
aVMost people think about either empty space
p6
aVor clear blue sky
p7
aVor sometimes trees dancing in the wind.
p8
aVAnd then I remember my high school chemistry teacher with really long socks
p9
aVat the blackboard,
p10
aVdrawing diagrams of bubbles connected to other bubbles,
p11
aVand describing how they vibrate and collide in a kind of frantic soup.
p12
aa(lp13
VBut really, we tend not to think about the air that much at all.
p14
aVWe notice it mostly
p15
aVwhen there's some kind of unpleasant sensory intrusion upon it,
p16
aVlike a terrible smell or something visible like smoke or mist.
p17
aVBut it's always there.
p18
aVIt's touching all of us right now.
p19
aVIt's even inside us.
p20
aVOur air is immediate, vital and intimate.
p21
aVAnd yet, it's so easily forgotten.
p22
aa(lp23
VSo what is the air?
p24
aVIt's the combination of the invisible gases that envelop the Earth,
p25
aVattracted by the Earth's gravitational pull.
p26
aVAnd even though I'm a visual artist,
p27
aVI'm interested in the invisibility of the air.
p28
aVI'm interested in how we imagine it,
p29
aVhow we experience it
p30
aVand how we all have an innate understanding of its materiality
p31
aVthrough breathing.
p32
aVAll life on Earth changes the air through gas exchange,
p33
aVand we're all doing it right now.
p34
aVActually, why don't we all right now together take
p35
aVone big, collective, deep breath in.
p36
aa(lp37
VReady? In. (Inhales)
p38
aVAnd out. (Exhales)
p39
aa(lp40
VThat air that you just exhaled,
p41
aVyou enriched a hundred times in carbon dioxide.
p42
aVSo roughly five liters of air per breath, 17 breaths per minute
p43
aVof the 525,600 minutes per year,
p44
aVcomes to approximately 45 million liters of air,
p45
aVenriched 100 times in carbon dioxide,
p46
aVjust for you.
p47
aVNow, that's equivalent to about 18 Olympic-sized swimming pools.
p48
aa(lp49
VFor me, air is plural.
p50
aVIt's simultaneously as small as our breathing
p51
aVand as big as the planet.
p52
aVAnd it's kind of hard to picture.
p53
aVMaybe it's impossible, and maybe it doesn't matter.
p54
aa(lp55
VThrough my visual arts practice,
p56
aVI try to make air, not so much picture it,
p57
aVbut to make it visceral and tactile and haptic.
p58
aVI try to expand this notion of the aesthetic, how things look,
p59
aVso that it can include things like how it feels on your skin
p60
aVand in your lungs,
p61
aVand how your voice sounds as it passes through it.
p62
aVI explore the weight, density and smell, but most importantly,
p63
aVI think a lot about the stories we attach to different kinds of air.
p64
aa(lp65
VThis is a work I made in 2014.
p66
aVIt's called "Different Kinds of Air: A Plant's Diary,"
p67
aVwhere I was recreating the air from different eras in Earth's evolution,
p68
aVand inviting the audience to come in and breathe them with me.
p69
aVAnd it's really surprising, so drastically different.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow, I'm not a scientist,
p72
aVbut atmospheric scientists will look for traces
p73
aVin the air chemistry in geology,
p74
aVa bit like how rocks can oxidize,
p75
aVand they'll extrapolate that information and aggregate it,
p76
aVsuch that they can pretty much form a recipe
p77
aVfor the air at different times.
p78
aVThen I come in as the artist and take that recipe
p79
aVand recreate it using the component gases.
p80
aa(lp81
VI was particularly interested in moments of time
p82
aVthat are examples of life changing the air,
p83
aVbut also the air that can influence how life will evolve,
p84
aVlike Carboniferous air.
p85
aVIt's from about 300 to 350 million years ago.
p86
aVIt's an era known as the time of the giants.
p87
aVSo for the first time in the history of life,
p88
aVlignin evolves.
p89
aVThat's the hard stuff that trees are made of.
p90
aVSo trees effectively invent their own trunks at this time,
p91
aVand they get really big, bigger and bigger,
p92
aVand pepper the Earth,
p93
aVreleasing oxygen, releasing oxygen, releasing oxygen,
p94
aVsuch that the oxygen levels are about twice as high
p95
aVas what they are today.
p96
aVAnd this rich air supports massive insects \u2014
p97
aVhuge spiders and dragonflies with a wingspan of about 65 centimeters.
p98
aVTo breathe, this air is really clean and really fresh.
p99
aVIt doesn't so much have a flavor,
p100
aVbut it does give your body a really subtle kind of boost of energy.
p101
aVIt's really good for hangovers.
p102
aa(lp103
V(Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VOr there's the air of the Great Dying \u2014
p106
aVthat's about 252.5 million years ago,
p107
aVjust before the dinosaurs evolve.
p108
aVIt's a really short time period, geologically speaking,
p109
aVfrom about 20- to 200,000 years.
p110
aVReally quick.
p111
aVThis is the greatest extinction event in Earth's history,
p112
aVeven bigger than when the dinosaurs died out.
p113
aVEighty-five to 95 percent of species at this time die out,
p114
aVand simultaneous to that is a huge, dramatic spike in carbon dioxide,
p115
aVthat a lot of scientists agree
p116
aVcomes from a simultaneous eruption of volcanoes
p117
aVand a runaway greenhouse effect.
p118
aVOxygen levels at this time go to below half of what they are today,
p119
aVso about 10 percent.
p120
aVSo this air would definitely not support human life,
p121
aVbut it's OK to just have a breath.
p122
aVAnd to breathe, it's oddly comforting.
p123
aVIt's really calming, it's quite warm
p124
aVand it has a flavor a little bit like soda water.
p125
aVIt has that kind of spritz, quite pleasant.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo with all this thinking about air of the past,
p128
aVit's quite natural to start thinking about the air of the future.
p129
aVAnd instead of being speculative with air
p130
aVand just making up what I think might be the future air,
p131
aVI discovered this human-synthesized air.
p132
aVThat means that it doesn't occur anywhere in nature,
p133
aVbut it's made by humans in a laboratory
p134
aVfor application in different industrial settings.
p135
aa(lp136
VWhy is it future air?
p137
aVWell, this air is a really stable molecule
p138
aVthat will literally be part of the air once it's released,
p139
aVfor the next 300 to 400 years, before it's broken down.
p140
aVSo that's about 12 to 16 generations.
p141
aVAnd this future air has some very sensual qualities.
p142
aVIt's very heavy.
p143
aVIt's about eight times heavier than the air we're used to breathing.
p144
aVIt's so heavy, in fact, that when you breathe it in,
p145
aVwhatever words you speak are kind of literally heavy as well,
p146
aVso they dribble down your chin and drop to the floor
p147
aVand soak into the cracks.
p148
aVIt's an air that operates quite a lot like a liquid.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow, this air comes with an ethical dimension as well.
p151
aVHumans made this air,
p152
aVbut it's also the most potent greenhouse gas
p153
aVthat has ever been tested.
p154
aVIts warming potential is 24,000 times that of carbon dioxide,
p155
aVand it has that longevity of 12 to 16 generations.
p156
aVSo this ethical confrontation is really central to my work.
p157
aV(In a lowered voice) It has another quite surprising quality.
p158
aVIt changes the sound of your voice quite dramatically.
p159
aa(lp160
V(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VSo when we start to think \u2014 ooh! It's still there a bit.
p163
aa(lp164
V(Laughter)
p165
aa(lp166
VWhen we think about climate change,
p167
aVwe probably don't think about giant insects and erupting volcanoes
p168
aVor funny voices.
p169
aVThe images that more readily come to mind
p170
aVare things like retreating glaciers and polar bears adrift on icebergs.
p171
aVWe think about pie charts and column graphs
p172
aVand endless politicians talking to scientists wearing cardigans.
p173
aa(lp174
VBut perhaps it's time we start thinking about climate change
p175
aVon the same visceral level that we experience the air.
p176
aVLike air, climate change is simultaneously at the scale of the molecule,
p177
aVthe breath and the planet.
p178
aVIt's immediate, vital and intimate,
p179
aVas well as being amorphous and cumbersome.
p180
aVAnd yet, it's so easily forgotten.
p181
aa(lp182
VClimate change is the collective self-portrait of humanity.
p183
aVIt reflects our decisions as individuals,
p184
aVas governments and as industries.
p185
aVAnd if there's anything I've learned from looking at air,
p186
aVit's that even though it's changing, it persists.
p187
aVIt may not support the kind of life that we'd recognize,
p188
aVbut it will support something.
p189
aVAnd if we humans are such a vital part of that change,
p190
aVI think it's important that we can feel the discussion.
p191
aVBecause even though it's invisible,
p192
aVhumans are leaving a very vibrant trace in the air.
p193

VThank you.
