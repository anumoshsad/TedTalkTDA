VThe brilliant playwright, Adrienne Kennedy,
p4
aVwrote a volume called
p5
aV"People Who Led to My Plays."
p6
aVAnd if I were to write a volume,
p7
aVit would be called,
p8
aV"Artists Who Have Led My Exhibitions"
p9
aVbecause my work,
p10
aVin understanding art and in understanding culture,
p11
aVhas come by following artists,
p12
aVby looking at what artists mean
p13
aVand what they do and who they are.
p14
aVJ.J. from "Good Times,"
p15
aV(Applause)
p16
aVsignificant to many people of course
p17
aVbecause of "Dy-no-mite,"
p18
aVbut perhaps more significant
p19
aVas the first, really, black artist
p20
aVon primetime TV.
p21
aVJean-Michel Basquiat,
p22
aVimportant to me because [he was]
p23
aVthe first black artist in real time
p24
aVthat showed me the possibility of
p25
aVwho and what I was about to enter into.
p26
aa(lp27
VMy overall project is about art \u2014
p28
aVspecifically, about black artists \u2014
p29
aVvery generally
p30
aVabout the way in which art
p31
aVcan change the way we think
p32
aVabout culture and ourselves.
p33
aVMy interest is in artists
p34
aVwho understand and rewrite history,
p35
aVwho think about themselves
p36
aVwithin the narrative
p37
aVof the larger world of art,
p38
aVbut who have created new places
p39
aVfor us to see and understand.
p40
aVI'm showing two artists here,  Glenn Ligon and Kara Walker,
p41
aVtwo of many who really form for me
p42
aVthe essential questions that I wanted to bring
p43
aVas a curator to the world.
p44
aVI was interested in the idea
p45
aVof why and how
p46
aVI could create a new story,
p47
aVa new narrative in art history
p48
aVand a new narrative in the world.
p49
aVAnd to do this, I knew
p50
aVthat I had to see the way in which artists work,
p51
aVunderstand the artist's studio
p52
aVas a laboratory,
p53
aVimagine, then,
p54
aVreinventing the museum as a think tank
p55
aVand looking at the exhibition
p56
aVas the ultimate white paper \u2014 asking questions,
p57
aVproviding the space
p58
aVto look and to think about answers.
p59
aa(lp60
VIn 1994,
p61
aVwhen I was a curator at the Whitney Museum,
p62
aVI made an exhibition called Black Male.
p63
aVIt looked at the intersection
p64
aVof race and gender
p65
aVin contemporary American art.
p66
aVIt sought to express
p67
aVthe ways in which art
p68
aVcould provide a space for dialogue \u2014
p69
aVcomplicated dialogue,
p70
aVdialogue with many, many points of entry \u2014
p71
aVand how the museum could be the space
p72
aVfor this contest of ideas.
p73
aVThis exhibition included
p74
aVover 20 artists
p75
aVof various ages and races,
p76
aVbut all looking at black masculinity
p77
aVfrom a very particular point of view.
p78
aVWhat was significant about this exhibition
p79
aVis the way in which
p80
aVit engaged me in my role
p81
aVas a curator, as a catalyst,
p82
aVfor this dialogue.
p83
aVOne of the things that happened
p84
aVvery distinctly in the course of this exhibition
p85
aVis I was confronted with the idea
p86
aVof how powerful images can be
p87
aVin people's understanding  of themselves and each other.
p88
aa(lp89
VI'm showing you two works, one on the right by Leon Golub,
p90
aVone on the left by Robert Colescott.
p91
aVAnd in the course of the exhibition \u2014
p92
aVwhich was contentious, controversial
p93
aVand ultimately, for me,
p94
aVlife-changing
p95
aVin my sense of what art could be \u2014
p96
aVa woman came up to me on the gallery floor
p97
aVto express her concern about the nature
p98
aVof how powerful images could be
p99
aVand how we understood each other.
p100
aVAnd she pointed to the work on the left
p101
aVto tell me how problematic this image was,
p102
aVas it related, for her, to the idea of
p103
aVhow black people had been represented.
p104
aVAnd she pointed to the image on the right
p105
aVas an example, to me, of the kind of dignity
p106
aVthat needed to be portrayed
p107
aVto work against those images in the media.
p108
aVShe then assigned these works racial identities,
p109
aVbasically saying to me that the work on the right,
p110
aVclearly, was made by a black artist,
p111
aVthe work on the left, clearly, by a white artist,
p112
aVwhen, in effect,
p113
aVthat was the opposite case:
p114
aVBob Colescott, African-American artist;
p115
aVLeon Golub, a white artist.
p116
aVThe point of that for me was
p117
aVto say \u2014 in that space, in that moment \u2014
p118
aVthat I really, more than anything,
p119
aVwanted to understand
p120
aVhow images could work, how images did work,
p121
aVand how artists provided
p122
aVa space bigger than one
p123
aVthat we could imagine in our day-to-day lives
p124
aVto work through these images.
p125
aa(lp126
VFast-forward and I end up in Harlem;
p127
aVhome for many of black America,
p128
aVvery much the psychic heart
p129
aVof the black experience,
p130
aVreally the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed.
p131
aVHarlem now, sort of explaining
p132
aVand thinking of itself in this part of the century,
p133
aVlooking both backwards and forwards ...
p134
aVI always say Harlem is an interesting community
p135
aVbecause, unlike many other places,
p136
aVit thinks of itself in the past, present
p137
aVand the future simultaneously;
p138
aVno one speaks of it just in the now.
p139
aVIt's always what it was and what it can be.
p140
aVAnd, in thinking about that,
p141
aVthen my second project, the second question I ask is:
p142
aVCan a museum
p143
aVbe a catalyst in a community?
p144
aVCan a museum house artists
p145
aVand allow them to be change agents
p146
aVas communities rethink themselves?
p147
aVThis is Harlem, actually, on January 20th,
p148
aVthinking about itself in a very wonderful way.
p149
aa(lp150
VSo I work now at The Studio Museum in Harlem,
p151
aVthinking about exhibitions there,
p152
aVthinking about what it means to
p153
aVdiscover art's possibility.
p154
aVNow, what does this mean to some of you?
p155
aVIn some cases, I know that many of you
p156
aVare involved in cross-cultural dialogues,
p157
aVyou're involved in ideas of creativity and innovation.
p158
aVThink about the place that artists can play in that \u2014
p159
aVthat is the kind of incubation and advocacy
p160
aVthat I work towards, in working with young, black artists.
p161
aVThink about artists, not as content providers,
p162
aVthough they can be brilliant at that,
p163
aVbut, again, as real catalysts.
p164
aa(lp165
VThe Studio Museum was founded in the late 60s.
p166
aVAnd I bring this up because it's important to locate
p167
aVthis practice in history.
p168
aVTo look at 1968,
p169
aVin the incredible historic moment that it is,
p170
aVand think of the arc that has happened since then,
p171
aVto think of the possibilities that we are all
p172
aVprivileged to stand in today
p173
aVand imagine that this museum
p174
aVthat came out of a moment of great protest
p175
aVand one that was so much about
p176
aVexamining the history and the legacy
p177
aVof important African-American artists
p178
aVto the history of art in this country
p179
aVlike Jacob Lawrence, Norman Lewis,
p180
aVRomare Bearden.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd then, of course,
p183
aVto bring us to today.
p184
aVIn 1975, Muhammad Ali
p185
aVgave a lecture at Harvard University.
p186
aVAfter his lecture, a student got up and said to him,
p187
aV"Give us a poem."
p188
aVAnd Mohammed Ali said, "Me, we."
p189
aVA profound statement about the individual and the community.
p190
aVThe space in which now,
p191
aVin my project of discovery, of thinking about artists,
p192
aVof trying to define
p193
aVwhat might be
p194
aVblack art cultural movement of the 21st century.
p195
aVWhat that might mean
p196
aVfor cultural movements all over this moment,
p197
aVthe "me, we" seems
p198
aVincredibly prescient
p199
aVtotally important.
p200
aa(lp201
VTo this end,
p202
aVthe specific project that has made this possible for me
p203
aVis a series of exhibitions,
p204
aVall titled with an F \u2014
p205
aVFreestyle, Frequency and Flow \u2014
p206
aVwhich have set out to discover
p207
aVand define
p208
aVthe young, black artists working in this moment
p209
aVwho I feel strongly
p210
aVwill continue to work over the next many years.
p211
aVThis series of exhibitions
p212
aVwas made specifically
p213
aVto try and question
p214
aVthe idea of what it would mean
p215
aVnow, at this point in history,
p216
aVto see art as a catalyst;
p217
aVwhat it means now, at this point in history,
p218
aVas we define and redefine culture,
p219
aVblack culture specifically in my case,
p220
aVbut culture generally.
p221
aVI named this group of artists
p222
aVaround an idea, which I put out there
p223
aVcalled post-black,
p224
aVreally meant to define them
p225
aVas artists who came and start their work now,
p226
aVlooking back at history but start in this moment, historically.
p227
aa(lp228
VIt is really in this sense of discovery
p229
aVthat I have a new set of questions that I'm asking.
p230
aVThis new set of questions is:
p231
aVWhat does it mean, right now,
p232
aVto be African-American in America?
p233
aVWhat can artwork say about this?
p234
aVWhere can a museum exist
p235
aVas the place for us all
p236
aVto have this conversation?
p237
aVReally, most exciting about this
p238
aVis thinking about the energy and the excitement
p239
aVthat young artists can bring.
p240
aVTheir works for me are about,
p241
aVnot always just simply
p242
aVabout the aesthetic innovation
p243
aVthat their minds imagine, that their visions create
p244
aVand put out there in the world,
p245
aVbut more, perhaps, importantly,
p246
aVthrough the excitement of the community
p247
aVthat they create as important voices
p248
aVthat would allow us right now to understand our situation,
p249
aVas well as in the future.
p250
aVI am continually amazed
p251
aVby the way in which
p252
aVthe subject of race
p253
aVcan take itself in many places
p254
aVthat we don't imagine it should be.
p255
aVI am always amazed
p256
aVby the way in which artists are willing
p257
aVto do that in their work.
p258
aVIt is why I look to art.
p259
aVIt's why I ask questions of art.
p260
aVIt is why I make exhibitions.
p261
aa(lp262
VNow, this exhibition, as I said,
p263
aV40 young artists done over the course of eight years,
p264
aVand for me it's about considering the implications.
p265
aVIt's considering the implications of
p266
aVwhat this generation has to say to the rest of us.
p267
aVIt's considering what it means for these artists
p268
aVto be both out in the world as their work travels,
p269
aVbut in their communities
p270
aVas people who are seeing and thinking
p271
aVabout the issues that face us.
p272
aVIt's also about thinking about
p273
aVthe creative spirit and nurturing it,
p274
aVand imagining, particularly in urban America,
p275
aVabout the nurturing of the spirit.
p276
aa(lp277
VNow, where, perhaps, does this end up right now?
p278
aVFor me, it is about re-imagining
p279
aVthis cultural discourse in an international context.
p280
aVSo the last iteration of this project
p281
aVhas been called Flow,
p282
aVwith the idea now of creating
p283
aVa real network
p284
aVof artists around the world;
p285
aVreally looking, not so much
p286
aVfrom Harlem and out, but looking across,
p287
aVand Flow looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa.
p288
aVAnd as many of us think about that continent
p289
aVand think about what if means
p290
aVto us all in the 21st century,
p291
aVI have begun that looking
p292
aVthrough artists, through artworks,
p293
aVand imagining what they can tell us about the future,
p294
aVwhat they tell us about our future,
p295
aVand what they create in their sense of
p296
aVoffering us this great possibility of watching
p297
aVthat continent emerge as part
p298
aVof our bigger dialogue.
p299
aVSo, what do I discover
p300
aa(lp301
Vwhen I look at artworks?
p302
aVWhat do I think about
p303
aVwhen I think about art?
p304
aVI feel like the privilege I've had as a curator
p305
aVis not just the discovery of new works,
p306
aVthe discovery of exciting works.
p307
aVBut, really, it has been
p308
aVwhat I've discovered about myself
p309
aVand what I can offer
p310
aVin the space of an exhibition,
p311
aVto talk about beauty, to talk about power,
p312
aVto talk about ourselves,
p313
aVand to talk and speak to each other.
p314
aVThat's what makes me get up every day
p315
aVand want to think about
p316
aVthis generation of black artists and artists around the world.
