VThe world's largest and most devastating environmental and industrial project
p4
aVis situated in the heart of the largest and most intact forest in the world,
p5
aVCanada's boreal forest.
p6
aVIt stretches right across Northern Canada, in Labrador,
p7
aVit's home to the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world:
p8
aVthe George River caribou herd,
p9
aVnumbering approximately 400,000 animals.
p10
aVUnfortunately, when I was there, I couldn't find one of them,
p11
aVbut you have the antlers as proof.
p12
aa(lp13
VAll across the boreal,
p14
aVwe're blessed with this incredible abundance of wetlands.
p15
aVWetlands, globally, are one of the most endangered ecosystems.
p16
aVThey're absolutely critical ecosystems,
p17
aVthey clean air, they clean water,
p18
aVthey sequester large amounts of greenhouse gases,
p19
aVand they're home to a huge diversity of species.
p20
aVIn the boreal, they are also the home
p21
aVwhere almost 50 percent of the 800 bird species found in North America
p22
aVmigrate north to breed and raise their young.
p23
aa(lp24
VIn Ontario, the boreal marches down south to the north shore of Lake Superior.
p25
aVAnd these incredibly beautiful boreal forests
p26
aVwere the inspiration for some of the most famous art in Canadian history,
p27
aVthe Group of Seven were very inspired by this landscape,
p28
aVand so the boreal is not just a really key part of our natural heritage,
p29
aVbut also an important part of our cultural heritage.
p30
aa(lp31
VIn Manitoba, this is an image from the east side of Lake Winnipeg,
p32
aVand this is the home of the newly designated UNESCO Cultural Heritage site.
p33
aVIn Saskatchewan, as across all of the boreal,
p34
aVhome to some of our most famous rivers,
p35
aVan incredible network of rivers and lakes that every school-age child learns about,
p36
aVthe Peace, the Athabasca, the Churchill here, the Mackenzie,
p37
aVand these networks were the historical routes
p38
aVfor the voyageur and the coureur de bois,
p39
aVthe first non-aboriginal explorers of Northern Canada
p40
aVthat, taking from the First Nations people,
p41
aVused canoes and paddled to explore
p42
aVfor a trade route, a Northwest Passage for the fur trade.
p43
aa(lp44
VIn the North, the boreal is bordered by the tundra,
p45
aVand just below that, in Yukon,
p46
aVwe have this incredible valley, the Tombstone Valley.
p47
aVAnd the Tombstone Valley is home to the Porcupine caribou herd.
p48
aVNow you've probably heard about the Porcupine caribou herd
p49
aVin the context of its breeding ground in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
p50
aVWell, the wintering ground is also critical
p51
aVand it also is not protected,
p52
aVand is potentially, could be potentially, exploited for gas and mineral rights.
p53
aa(lp54
VThe western border of the boreal in British Columbia
p55
aVis marked by the Coast Mountains,
p56
aVand on the other side of those mountains
p57
aVis the greatest remaining temperate rainforest in the world,
p58
aVthe Great Bear Rainforest,
p59
aVand we'll discuss that in a few minutes in a bit more detail.
p60
aa(lp61
VAll across the boreal,
p62
aVit's home for a huge incredible range of indigenous peoples,
p63
aVand a rich and varied culture.
p64
aVAnd I think that one of the reasons
p65
aVwhy so many of these groups have retained a link to the past,
p66
aVknow their native languages,
p67
aVthe songs, the dances, the traditions,
p68
aVI think part of that reason is because of the remoteness,
p69
aVthe span and the wilderness
p70
aVof this almost 95 percent intact ecosystem.
p71
aVAnd I think particularly now,
p72
aVas we see ourselves in a time of environmental crisis,
p73
aVwe can learn so much from these people
p74
aVwho have lived so sustainably in this ecosystem
p75
aVfor over 10,000 years.
p76
aa(lp77
VIn the heart of this ecosystem is the very antithesis
p78
aVof all of these values that we've been talking about,
p79
aVand I think these are some of the core values
p80
aVthat make us proud to be Canadians.
p81
aVThis is the Alberta tar sands,
p82
aVthe largest oil reserves on the planet outside of Saudi Arabia.
p83
aVTrapped underneath the boreal forest and wetlands of northern Alberta
p84
aVare these vast reserves of this sticky, tar-like bitumen.
p85
aVAnd the mining and the exploitation of that
p86
aVis creating devastation on a scale that the planet has never seen before.
p87
aa(lp88
VI want to try to convey some sort of a sense of the size of this.
p89
aVIf you look at that truck there,
p90
aVit is the largest truck of its kind on the planet.
p91
aVIt is a 400-ton-capacity dump truck
p92
aVand its dimensions are 45 feet long by 35 feet wide and 25 feet high.
p93
aVIf I stand beside that truck,
p94
aVmy head comes to around the bottom of the yellow part of that hubcap.
p95
aVWithin the dimensions of that truck,
p96
aVyou could build a 3,000-square-foot two-story home quite easily.
p97
aVI did the math.
p98
aVSo instead of thinking of that as a truck, think of that as a 3,000-square-foot home.
p99
aVThat's not a bad size home.
p100
aVAnd line those trucks / homes back and forth
p101
aVacross there from the bottom all the way to the top.
p102
aVAnd then think of how large that very small section of one mine is.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow, you can apply that same kind of thinking here as well.
p105
aVNow, here you see \u2014 of course, as you go further on,
p106
aVthese trucks become like a pixel.
p107
aVAgain, imagine those all back and forth there.
p108
aVHow large is that one portion of a mine?
p109
aVThat would be a huge, vast metropolitan area,
p110
aVprobably much larger than the city of Victoria.
p111
aVAnd this is just one of a number of mines,
p112
aV10 mines so far right now.
p113
aVThis is one section of one mining complex,
p114
aVand there are about another 40 or 50 in the approval process.
p115
aVNo tar sands mine has actually ever been denied approval,
p116
aVso it is essentially a rubber stamp.
p117
aa(lp118
VThe other method of extraction is what's called the in situ.
p119
aVAnd here, massive amounts of water
p120
aVare superheated and pumped through the ground,
p121
aVthrough these vasts networks of pipelines,
p122
aVseismic lines, drill paths, compressor stations.
p123
aVAnd even though this looks maybe not quite as repugnant as the mines,
p124
aVit's even more damaging in some ways.
p125
aVIt impacts and fragments a larger part of the wilderness,
p126
aVwhere there is 90 percent reduction of key species,
p127
aVlike woodland caribou and grizzly bears,
p128
aVand it consumes even more energy, more water,
p129
aVand produces at least as much greenhouse gas.
p130
aVSo these in situ developments are at least as ecologically damaging as the mines.
p131
aa(lp132
VThe oil produced from either method
p133
aVproduces more greenhouse gas emissions than any other oil.
p134
aVThis is one of the reasons why it's called the world's dirtiest oil.
p135
aVIt's also one of the reasons
p136
aVwhy it is the largest and fastest-growing single source of carbon in Canada,
p137
aVand it is also a reason why Canada is now number three
p138
aVin terms of producing carbon per person.
p139
aVThe tailings ponds are the largest toxic impoundments on the planet.
p140
aVOil sands \u2014 or rather, I should say tar sands \u2014
p141
aVoil sands is a PR-created term
p142
aVso that the oil companies wouldn't be trying to promote something
p143
aVthat sounds like a sticky tar-like substance that's the world's dirtiest oil.
p144
aVSo they decided to call it oil sands.
p145
aVThe tar sands consume more water than any other oil process,
p146
aVthree to five barrels of water are taken, polluted
p147
aVand then returned into tailings ponds,
p148
aVthe largest toxic impoundments on the planet.
p149
aa(lp150
VSemCrude, just one of the licensees, in just one of their tailings ponds,
p151
aVdumps 250,000 tons of this toxic gunk every single day.
p152
aVThat's creating the largest toxic impoundments in the history of the planet.
p153
aVSo far, this is enough toxin to cover the face of Lake Erie a foot deep.
p154
aVAnd the tailings ponds range in size up to 9,000 acres.
p155
aVThat's two-thirds the size of the entire island of Manhattan.
p156
aVThat's like from Wall Street at the southern edge of Manhattan
p157
aVup to maybe 120th Street.
p158
aVSo this is one of the larger tailings ponds.
p159
aVThis might be, what? I don't know, half the size of Manhattan.
p160
aVAnd you can see in the context,
p161
aVit's just a relatively small section of one of 10 mining complexes
p162
aVand another 40 to 50 on stream to be approved soon.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd of course, these tailings ponds \u2014
p165
aVwell, you can't see many ponds from outer space
p166
aVand you can see these, so maybe we should stop calling them ponds \u2014
p167
aVthese massive toxic wastelands are built
p168
aVunlined and on the banks of the Athabasca River.
p169
aVAnd the Athabasca River drains downstream to a range of aboriginal communities.
p170
aVIn Fort Chipewyan, the 800 people there, are finding toxins in the food chain,
p171
aVthis has been scientifically proven.
p172
aVThe tar sands toxins are in the food chain,
p173
aVand this is causing cancer rates up to 10 times
p174
aVwhat they are in the rest of Canada.
p175
aa(lp176
VIn spite of that, people have to live, have to eat this food in order to survive.
p177
aVThe incredibly high price of flying food
p178
aVinto these remote Northern aboriginal communities
p179
aVand the high rate of unemployment
p180
aVmakes this an absolute necessity for survival.
p181
aVAnd not that many years ago, I was lent a boat by a First Nations man,
p182
aVand he said, "When you go out on the river,
p183
aVdo not under any circumstances eat the fish.
p184
aVIt's carcinogenic."
p185
aVAnd yet, on the front porch of that man's cabin,
p186
aVI saw four fish.
p187
aVHe had to feed his family to survive.
p188
aVAnd as a parent, I just can't imagine what that does to your soul.
p189
aVAnd that's what we're doing.
p190
aa(lp191
VThe boreal forest is also perhaps our best defense
p192
aVagainst global warming and climate change.
p193
aVThe boreal forest sequesters more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem.
p194
aVAnd this is absolutely key.
p195
aVSo what we're doing is,
p196
aVwe're taking the most concentrated greenhouse gas sink \u2014
p197
aVtwice as much greenhouse gases are sequestered
p198
aVin the boreal per acre than the tropical rainforests.
p199
aVAnd what we're doing is we're destroying
p200
aVthis carbon sink, turning it into a carbon bomb.
p201
aVAnd we're replacing that with the largest industrial project
p202
aVin the history of the world,
p203
aVwhich is producing the most high-carbon greenhouse-gas emitting oil in the world.
p204
aVAnd we're doing this on the second largest oil reserves on the planet.
p205
aa(lp206
VThis is one of the reasons why Canada, originally a climate change hero \u2014
p207
aVwe were one of the first signatories of the Kyoto Accord.
p208
aVNow we're the country that has full-time lobbyists
p209
aVin the European Union and Washington DC,
p210
aVthreatening trade wars
p211
aVwhen these countries talk about wanting to bring in positive legislation
p212
aVto limit the import of high-carbon fuels,
p213
aVof greenhouse gas emissions, anything like this,
p214
aVat international conferences, whether they're in Copenhagen or Cancun,
p215
aVinternational conferences on climate change,
p216
aVwe're the country that gets the dinosaur award every single day,
p217
aVas being the biggest obstacle to progress on this issue.
p218
aa(lp219
VJust 70 miles downstream
p220
aVis the world's largest freshwater delta, the Peace-Athabasca Delta,
p221
aVthe only one at the juncture of all four migratory flyways.
p222
aVThis is a globally significant wetland, perhaps the greatest on the planet.
p223
aVIncredible habitat for half the bird species
p224
aVyou find in North America, migrating here.
p225
aVAnd also the last refuge for the largest herd of wild bison,
p226
aVand also, of course, critical habitat for another whole range of other species.
p227
aVBut it too is being threatened
p228
aVby the massive amount of water being drawn from the Athabasca,
p229
aVwhich feeds these wetlands,
p230
aVand also the incredible toxic burden
p231
aVof the largest toxic unlined impoundments on the planet,
p232
aVwhich are leaching in to the food chain for all the species downstream.
p233
aa(lp234
VSo as bad as all that is, things are going to get much worse \u2014 much, much worse.
p235
aVThis is the infrastructure as we see it about now.
p236
aVThis is what's planned for 2015.
p237
aVAnd you can see here the Keystone Pipeline,
p238
aVwhich would take tar sands raw down to the Gulf Coast,
p239
aVpunching a pipeline through the agricultural heart of North America,
p240
aVof the United States,
p241
aVand securing the contract with the dirtiest fuel in the world
p242
aVby consumption of the United States,
p243
aVand promoting a huge disincentive
p244
aVto a sustainable clean-energy future for America.
p245
aa(lp246
VHere you see the route down the Mackenzie valley.
p247
aVThis would put a pipeline to take natural gas from the Beaufort Sea
p248
aVthrough the heart of the third largest watershed basin in the world,
p249
aVand the only one which is 95 percent intact.
p250
aVAnd building a pipeline with an industrial highway
p251
aVwould change forever this incredible wilderness,
p252
aVwhich is a true rarity on the planet today.
p253
aa(lp254
VSo the Great Bear Rainforest is just over the hill there,
p255
aVwithin a few miles, we go from these dry boreal forests
p256
aVof 100-year-old trees, maybe 10 inches across,
p257
aVand soon, we're in the coastal temperate rainforest,
p258
aVrain-drenched, 1,000-year-old trees,
p259
aV20 feet across, a completely different ecosystem.
p260
aVAnd the Great Bear Rainforest is generally considered to be
p261
aVthe largest coastal temperate rainforest ecosystem in the world.
p262
aVSome of the greatest densities
p263
aVof some of the most iconic and threatened species on the planet.
p264
aVAnd yet there's a proposal, of course, to build a pipeline
p265
aVto take huge tankers, 10 times the size of the Exxon Valdez,
p266
aVthrough some of the most difficult-to-navigate waters in the world,
p267
aVwhere only just a few years ago, a BC ferry ran aground.
p268
aVWhen one of these tar sands tankers,
p269
aVcarrying the dirtiest oil, 10 times as much as the Exxon Valdez,
p270
aVeventually hits a rock and goes down,
p271
aVwe're going to have one of the worst ecological disasters
p272
aVthis planet has ever seen.
p273
aa(lp274
VAnd here we have the plan out to 2030.
p275
aVWhat they're proposing is an almost four-times increase in production,
p276
aVand that would industrialize an area the size of Florida.
p277
aVIn doing so, we'll be removing a large part of our greatest carbon sink
p278
aVand replacing it with the most high greenhouse-gas emission oil in the future.
p279
aVThe world does not need any more tar mines.
p280
aVThe world does not need any more pipelines
p281
aVto wed our addiction to fossil fuels.
p282
aVAnd the world certainly does not need
p283
aVthe largest toxic impoundments to grow and multiply
p284
aVand further threaten the downstream communities.
p285
aVAnd let's face it, we all live downstream
p286
aVin an era of global warming and climate change.
p287
aa(lp288
VWhat we need, is we all need to act
p289
aVto ensure that Canada respects the massive amounts of freshwater
p290
aVthat we hold in this country.
p291
aVWe need to ensure that these wetlands and forests
p292
aVthat are our best and greatest and most critical defense
p293
aVagainst global warming are protected,
p294
aVand we are not releasing that carbon bomb into the atmosphere.
p295
aVAnd we need to all gather together and say no to the tar sands.
p296
aVAnd we can do that.
p297
aVthere is a huge network all over the world,
p298
aVfighting to stop this project.
p299
aa(lp300
VAnd I quite simply think
p301
aVthat this is not something that should be decided just in Canada.
p302
aVEveryone in this room, everyone across Canada,
p303
aVeveryone listening to this presentation
p304
aVhas a role to play and, I think, a responsibility.
p305
aVBecause what we do here is going to change our history,
p306
aVit's going to color our possibility to survive,
p307
aVand for our children to survive and have a rich future.
p308
aa(lp309
VWe have an incredible gift in the boreal,
p310
aVan incredible opportunity to preserve our best defense against global warming,
p311
aVbut we could let that slip away.
p312
aVThe tar sands could threaten not just a large section of the boreal.
p313
aVIt compromises the life and the health
p314
aVof some of our most underprivileged and vulnerable people,
p315
aVthe aboriginal communities that have so much to teach us.
p316
aVIt could destroy the Athabasca Delta,
p317
aVthe largest and possibly greatest freshwater delta in the planet.
p318
aVIt could destroy the Great Bear Rainforest,
p319
aVthe largest temperate rainforest in the world.
p320
aVAnd it could have huge impacts
p321
aVon the future of the agricultural heartland of North America.
p322
aa(lp323
VI hope that you will all, if you've been moved by this presentation,
p324
aVjoin with the growing international community
p325
aVto get Canada to step up to its responsibilities,
p326
aVto convince Canada to go back to being a climate change champion
p327
aVinstead of a climate change villain,
p328
aVand to say no to the tar sands,
p329
aVand yes to a clean energy future for all.
p330
aVThank you so much.
