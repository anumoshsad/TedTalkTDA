VAn image is worth more than a thousand words,
p4
aVso I'm going to start my talk
p5
aVby stop talking and show you a few images
p6
aVthat I recently captured.
p7
aa(lp8
VSo by now, my talk is already 6,000 words long,
p9
aVand I feel like I should stop here.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VAt the same time, I probably owe you
p14
aVsome explanation
p15
aVabout the images that you just saw.
p16
aVWhat I am trying to do as a photographer,
p17
aVas an artist, is to bring the world
p18
aVof art and science together.
p19
aVWhether it is an image of a soap bubble
p20
aVcaptured at the very moment where it's bursting,
p21
aVas you can see in this image,
p22
aVwhether it's a universe made of tiny little beads
p23
aVof oil paint,
p24
aVstrange liquids that behave in very peculiar ways,
p25
aVor paint that is modeled by centrifugal forces,
p26
aVI'm always trying to link those two fields together.
p27
aa(lp28
VWhat I find very intriguing about those two
p29
aVis that they both look at the same thing:
p30
aVThey are a response to their surroundings.
p31
aVAnd yet, they do it in a very different way.
p32
aVIf you look at science on one hand,
p33
aVscience is a very rational approach
p34
aVto its surroundings,
p35
aVwhereas art on the other hand
p36
aVis usually an emotional approach to its surroundings.
p37
aVWhat I am trying to do is I'm trying
p38
aVto bring those two views into one
p39
aVso that my images both speak to the viewer's heart
p40
aVbut also to the viewer's brain.
p41
aVLet me demonstrate this based on three projects.
p42
aa(lp43
VThe first one has to do with making sound visible.
p44
aVNow as you may know,
p45
aVsound travels in waves,
p46
aVso if you have a speaker,
p47
aVa speaker actually does nothing else
p48
aVthan taking the audio signal,
p49
aVtransform it into a vibration,
p50
aVwhich is then transported through the air,
p51
aVis captured by our ear,
p52
aVand transformed into an audio signal again.
p53
aVNow I was thinking,
p54
aVhow can I make those sound waves visible?
p55
aVSo I came up with the following setup.
p56
aVI took a speaker, I placed a thin foil
p57
aVof plastic on top of that speaker,
p58
aVand then I added tiny little crystals
p59
aVon top of that speaker.
p60
aVAnd now, if I would play a sound through that speaker,
p61
aVit would cause the crystals to move up and down.
p62
aVNow this happens very fast,
p63
aVin the blink of an eye,
p64
aVso, together with LG, we captured this motion
p65
aVwith a camera that is able
p66
aVto capture more than 3,000 frames per second.
p67
aVLet me show you what this looks like.
p68
aa(lp69
V(Music: "Teardrop" by Massive Attack)
p70
aa(lp71
V(Applause)
p72
aa(lp73
VThank you very much.
p74
aVI agree, it looks pretty amazing.
p75
aa(lp76
VBut I have to tell you a funny story.
p77
aVI got an indoor sunburn doing this
p78
aVwhile shooting in Los Angeles.
p79
aVNow in Los Angeles, you could get a decent sunburn
p80
aVjust on any of the beaches,
p81
aVbut I got mine indoors,
p82
aVand what happened is that,
p83
aVif you're shooting at 3,000 frames per second,
p84
aVyou need to have a silly amount of light, lots of lights.
p85
aVSo we had this speaker set up,
p86
aVand we had the camera facing it,
p87
aVand lots of lights pointing at the speaker,
p88
aVand I would set up the speaker,
p89
aVput the tiny little crystals on top of that speaker,
p90
aVand we would do this over and over again,
p91
aVand it was until midday that I realized
p92
aVthat I had a completely red face
p93
aVbecause of the lights pointing at the speaker.
p94
aVWhat was so funny about it was that
p95
aVthe speaker was only coming from the right side,
p96
aVso the right side of my face was completely red
p97
aVand I looked like the Phantom of the Opera
p98
aVfor the rest of the week.
p99
aa(lp100
VLet me now turn to another project
p101
aVwhich involves less harmful substances.
p102
aVHas anyone of you heard of ferrofluid?
p103
aVAh, some of you have. Excellent.
p104
aVShould I skip that part?
p105
aa(lp106
V(Laughter)
p107
aa(lp108
VFerrofluid has a very strange behavior.
p109
aVIt's a liquid that is completely black.
p110
aVIt's got an oily consistency.
p111
aVAnd it's got tiny little particles of metal in it,
p112
aVwhich makes it magnetic.
p113
aVSo if I now put this liquid into a magnetic field,
p114
aVit would change its appearance.
p115
aa(lp116
VNow I've got a live demonstration over here
p117
aVto show this to you.
p118
aVSo I've got a camera pointing down at this plate,
p119
aVand underneath that plate, there is a magnet.
p120
aVNow I'm going to add some of that ferrofluid
p121
aVto that magnet.
p122
aa(lp123
VLet's just slightly move it to the right
p124
aVand maybe focus it a little bit more. Excellent.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo what you can see now is that
p127
aVthe ferrofluid has formed spikes.
p128
aVThis is due to the attraction and the repulsion
p129
aVof the individual particles inside the liquid.
p130
aVNow this looks already quite interesting,
p131
aVbut let me now add some watercolors to it.
p132
aVThose are just standard watercolors
p133
aVthat you would paint with.
p134
aVYou wouldn't paint with syringes,
p135
aVbut it works just the same.
p136
aVSo what happened now is,
p137
aVwhen the watercolor was flowing into the structure,
p138
aVthe watercolors do not mix with the ferrofluid.
p139
aVThat's because the ferrofluid itself
p140
aVis hydrophobic.
p141
aVThat means it doesn't mix with the water.
p142
aVAnd at the same time, it tries to maintain its position
p143
aVabove the magnet,
p144
aVand therefore, it creates those amazing-looking
p145
aVstructures of channels and tiny little ponds
p146
aVof colorful water paint.
p147
aVSo that was the second project.
p148
aa(lp149
VLet me now turn to the last project,
p150
aVwhich involves
p151
aVthe national beverage of Scotland.
p152
aV(Laughter)
p153
aa(lp154
VThis image, and also this one,
p155
aVwere made using whiskey.
p156
aVNow you might ask yourself,
p157
aVhow did he do that?
p158
aVDid he drink half a bottle of whiskey
p159
aVand then draw the hallucination he got
p160
aVfrom being drunk onto paper?
p161
aVI can assure you I was fully conscious
p162
aVwhile I was taking those pictures.
p163
aa(lp164
VNow, whiskey contains 40 percent of alcohol,
p165
aVand alcohol has got some very interesting properties.
p166
aVMaybe you have experienced
p167
aVsome of those properties before,
p168
aVbut I am talking about the physical properties,
p169
aVnot the other ones.
p170
aVSo when I open the bottle, the alcohol molecules
p171
aVwould spread in the air,
p172
aVand that's because alcohol is a very volatile substance.
p173
aVAnd at the same time, alcohol is highly flammable.
p174
aVAnd it was with those two properties
p175
aVthat I was able to create the images
p176
aVthat you're seeing right now.
p177
aa(lp178
VLet me demonstrate this over here.
p179
aVAnd what I have here is an empty glass vessel.
p180
aVIt's got nothing in it.
p181
aVAnd now I'm going to fill it with oxygen
p182
aVand whiskey.
p183
aVAdd some more.
p184
aVNow we just wait for a few seconds
p185
aVfor the molecules to spread inside the bottle.
p186
aVAnd now, let's set that on fire.
p187
aa(lp188
V(Laughter)
p189
aa(lp190
VSo that's all that happens.
p191
aVIt goes really fast, and it's not that impressive.
p192
aVI could do it again to show it one more time,
p193
aVbut some would argue that this is a complete waste
p194
aVof the whiskey, and that I should rather drink it.
p195
aa(lp196
VBut let me show you a slow motion
p197
aVin a completely darkened room
p198
aVof what I just showed you in this live demonstration.
p199
aVSo what happened is that the flame
p200
aVtraveled through the glass vessel from top to bottom,
p201
aVburning the mix of the air molecules
p202
aVand the alcohol.
p203
aVSo the images that you saw at the beginning,
p204
aVthey are actually a flame stopped in time
p205
aVwhile it is traveling through the bottle,
p206
aVand you have to imagine
p207
aVit was flipped around 180 degrees.
p208
aVSo that's how those images were made.
p209
aa(lp210
V(Applause)
p211
aa(lp212
VThank you.
p213
aa(lp214
VSo, I have now showed you three projects,
p215
aVand you might ask yourself, what is it good for?
p216
aVWhat's the idea behind it?
p217
aVIs it just a waste of whiskey?
p218
aVIs it just some strange materials?
p219
aVThose three projects, they're based on very simple
p220
aVscientific phenomena,
p221
aVsuch as magnetism, the sound waves,
p222
aVor over here, the physical properties of a substance,
p223
aVand what I'm trying to do
p224
aVis I'm trying to use these phenomena
p225
aVand show them in a poetic and unseen way,
p226
aVand therefore invite the viewer
p227
aVto pause for a moment
p228
aVand think about all the beauty
p229
aVthat is constantly surrounding us.
p230
aa(lp231
VThank you very much.
