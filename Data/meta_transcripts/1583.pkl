VThis is the skyline of my hometown, New Orleans.
p4
aVIt was a great place to grow up,
p5
aVbut it's one of the most vulnerable spots in the world.
p6
aVHalf the city is already below sea level.
p7
aVIn 2005, the world watched as New Orleans
p8
aVand the Gulf Coast were devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
p9
aVOne thousand, eight hundred and thirty-six people died. Nearly 300,000 homes were lost.
p10
aVThese are my mother's, at the top \u2014
p11
aValthough that's not her car,
p12
aVit was carried there by floodwaters up to the roof \u2014
p13
aVand that's my sister's, below.
p14
aVFortunately, they and other family members got out in time,
p15
aVbut they lost their homes, and as you can see,
p16
aVjust about everything in them.
p17
aa(lp18
VOther parts of the world have been hit by storms
p19
aVin even more devastating ways.
p20
aVIn 2008, Cyclone Nargis and its aftermath
p21
aVkilled 138,000 in Myanmar.
p22
aVClimate change is affecting our homes, our communities,
p23
aVour way of life. We should be preparing
p24
aVat every scale and at every opportunity.
p25
aVThis talk is about being prepared for, and resilient to
p26
aVthe changes that are coming and that will affect our homes
p27
aVand our collective home, the Earth.
p28
aa(lp29
VThe changes in these times won't affect us all equally.
p30
aVThere are important distributional consequences,
p31
aVand they're not what you always might think.
p32
aVIn New Orleans, the elderly and female-headed households
p33
aVwere among the most vulnerable.
p34
aVFor those in vulnerable, low-lying nations,
p35
aVhow do you put a dollar value on losing your country
p36
aVwhere you ancestors are buried? And where will your people go?
p37
aVAnd how will they cope in a foreign land?
p38
aVWill there be tensions over immigration,
p39
aVor conflicts over competition for limited resources?
p40
aVIt's already fueled conflicts in Chad and Darfur.
p41
aVLike it or not, ready or not, this is our future.
p42
aa(lp43
VSure, some are looking for opportunities in this new world.
p44
aVThat's the Russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom
p45
aVto stake a claim for minerals under the receding Arctic sea ice.
p46
aVBut while there might be some short-term individual winners,
p47
aVour collective losses will far outweigh them.
p48
aVLook no further than the insurance industry as they struggle
p49
aVto cope with mounting catastrophic losses
p50
aVfrom extreme weather events.
p51
aVThe military gets it. They call climate change
p52
aVa threat multiplier that could harm stability and security,
p53
aVwhile governments around the world are evaluating
p54
aVhow to respond.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo what can we do? How can we prepare and adapt?
p57
aVI'd like to share three sets of examples, starting with
p58
aVadapting to violent storms and floods.
p59
aVIn New Orleans, the I-10 Twin Spans,
p60
aVwith sections knocked out in Katrina, have been rebuilt
p61
aV21 feet higher to allow for greater storm surge.
p62
aVAnd these raised and energy-efficient homes
p63
aVwere developed by Brad Pitt and Make It Right
p64
aVfor the hard-hit Ninth Ward.
p65
aVThe devastated church my mom attends has been
p66
aVnot only rebuilt higher, it's poised to become
p67
aVthe first Energy Star church in the country.
p68
aVThey're selling electricity back to the grid
p69
aVthanks to solar panels, reflective paint and more.
p70
aVTheir March electricity bill was only 48 dollars.
p71
aVNow these are examples of New Orleans rebuilding in this way,
p72
aVbut better if others act proactively with these changes in mind.
p73
aVFor example, in Galveston, here's a resilient home
p74
aVthat survived Hurricane Ike,
p75
aVwhen others on neighboring lots clearly did not.
p76
aVAnd around the world, satellites and warning systems
p77
aVare saving lives in flood-prone areas such as Bangladesh.
p78
aa(lp79
VBut as important as technology and infrastructure are,
p80
aVperhaps the human element is even more critical.
p81
aVWe need better planning and systems for evacuation.
p82
aVWe need to better understand how people make decisions
p83
aVin times of crisis, and why.
p84
aVWhile it's true that many who died in Katrina did not have access to transportation,
p85
aVothers who did refused to leave as the storm approached,
p86
aVoften because available transportation and shelters
p87
aVrefused to allow them to take their pets.
p88
aVImagine leaving behind your own pet in an evacuation or a rescue.
p89
aVFortunately in 2006, Congress passed
p90
aVthe Pet Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act (Laughter)
p91
aV\u2014 it spells "PETS" \u2014 to change that.
p92
aa(lp93
VSecond, preparing for heat and drought.
p94
aVFarmers are facing challenges of drought from Asia
p95
aVto Africa, from Australia to Oklahoma,
p96
aVwhile heat waves linked with climate change
p97
aVhave killed tens of thousands of people
p98
aVin Western Europe in 2003, and again in Russia in 2010.
p99
aVIn Ethiopia, 70 percent, that's 7-0 percent of the population,
p100
aVdepends on rainfall for its livelihood.
p101
aVOxfam and Swiss Re, together with Rockefeller Foundation,
p102
aVare helping farmers like this one build hillside terraces
p103
aVand find other ways to conserve water,
p104
aVbut they're also providing for insurance when the droughts do come.
p105
aVThe stability this provides is giving the farmers
p106
aVthe confidence to invest.
p107
aVIt's giving them access to affordable credit.
p108
aVIt's allowing them to become more productive so that
p109
aVthey can afford their own insurance over time, without assistance.
p110
aVIt's a virtuous cycle, and one that could be replicated
p111
aVthroughout the developing world.
p112
aVAfter a lethal 1995 heat wave
p113
aVturned refrigerator trucks from the popular
p114
aVTaste of Chicago festival into makeshift morgues,
p115
aVChicago became a recognized leader,
p116
aVtamping down on the urban heat island impact
p117
aVthrough opening cooling centers,
p118
aVoutreach to vulnerable neighborhoods, planting trees,
p119
aVcreating cool white or vegetated green roofs.
p120
aVThis is City Hall's green roof, next to Cook County's [portion of the] roof,
p121
aVwhich is 77 degrees Fahrenheit hotter at the surface.
p122
aVWashington, D.C., last year, actually led the nation
p123
aVin new green roofs installed, and they're funding this in part
p124
aVthanks to a five-cent tax on plastic bags.
p125
aVThey're splitting the cost of installing these green roofs
p126
aVwith home and building owners.
p127
aVThe roofs not only temper urban heat island impact
p128
aVbut they save energy, and therefore money,
p129
aVthe emissions that cause climate change,
p130
aVand they also reduce stormwater runoff.
p131
aVSo some solutions to heat can provide for win-win-wins.
p132
aa(lp133
VThird, adapting to rising seas.
p134
aVSea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems, agriculture,
p135
aVeven major cities. This is what one to two meters
p136
aVof sea level rise looks like in the Mekong Delta.
p137
aVThat's where half of Vietnam's rice is grown.
p138
aVInfrastructure is going to be affected.
p139
aVAirports around the world are located on the coast.
p140
aVIt makes sense, right? There's open space,
p141
aVthe planes can take off and land without worrying about
p142
aVcreating noise or avoiding tall buildings.
p143
aVHere's just one example, San Francisco Airport,
p144
aVwith 16 inches or more of flooding.
p145
aVImagine the staggering cost of protecting
p146
aVthis vital infrastructure with levees.
p147
aVBut there might be some changes in store
p148
aVthat you might not imagine. For example,
p149
aVplanes require more runway for takeoff
p150
aVbecause the heated, less dense air, provides for less lift.
p151
aVSan Francisco is also spending 40 million dollars
p152
aVto rethink and redesign its water and sewage treatment,
p153
aVas water outfall pipes like this one can be flooded with seawater,
p154
aVcausing backups at the plant, harming the bacteria
p155
aVthat are needed to treat the waste.
p156
aVSo these outfall pipes have been retrofitted
p157
aVto shut seawater off from entering the system.
p158
aa(lp159
VBeyond these technical solutions, our work
p160
aVat the Georgetown Climate Center with communities
p161
aVencourages them to look at what existing legal and policy tools are available
p162
aVand to consider how they can accommodate change.
p163
aVFor example, in land use, which areas do you want
p164
aVto protect, through adding a seawall, for example,
p165
aValter, by raising buildings, or retreat from,
p166
aVto allow the migration of important natural systems,
p167
aVsuch as wetlands or beaches?
p168
aVOther examples to consider. In the U.K.,
p169
aVthe Thames Barrier protects London from storm surge.
p170
aVThe Asian Cities Climate [Change] Resilience Network
p171
aVis restoring vital ecosystems like forest mangroves.
p172
aVThese are not only important ecosystems in their own right,
p173
aVbut they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities.
p174
aVNew York City is incredibly vulnerable to storms,
p175
aVas you can see from this clever sign, and to sea level rise,
p176
aVand to storm surge, as you can see from the subway flooding.
p177
aVBut back above ground, these raised ventilation grates
p178
aVfor the subway system show that solutions can be both
p179
aVfunctional and attractive. In fact, in New York,
p180
aVSan Francisco and London, designers have envisioned
p181
aVways to better integrate the natural and built environments
p182
aVwith climate change in mind.
p183
aVI think these are inspiring examples of what's possible
p184
aVwhen we feel empowered to plan for a world that will be different.
p185
aa(lp186
VBut now, a word of caution.
p187
aVAdaptation's too important to be left to the experts.
p188
aVWhy? Well, there are no experts.
p189
aVWe're entering uncharted territory, and yet
p190
aVour expertise and our systems are based on the past.
p191
aV"Stationarity" is the notion that we can anticipate the future
p192
aVbased on the past, and plan accordingly,
p193
aVand this principle governs much of our engineering,
p194
aVour design of critical infrastructure, city water systems,
p195
aVbuilding codes, even water rights and other legal precedents.
p196
aVBut we can simply no longer rely on established norms.
p197
aVWe're operating outside the bounds of CO2 concentrations
p198
aVthat the planet has seen for hundreds of thousands of years.
p199
aa(lp200
VThe larger point I'm trying to make is this.
p201
aVIt's up to us to look at our homes and our communities,
p202
aVour vulnerabilities and our exposures to risk,
p203
aVand to find ways to not just survive, but to thrive,
p204
aVand it's up to us to plan and to prepare
p205
aVand to call on our government leaders and require them
p206
aVto do the same, even while they address
p207
aVthe underlying causes of climate change.
p208
aVThere are no quick fixes.
p209
aVThere are no one-size-fits-all solutions.
p210
aVWe're all learning by doing.
p211
aVBut the operative word is doing.
p212
