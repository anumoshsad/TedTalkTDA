VI consider it my life's mission
p4
aVto convey the urgency of climate change through my work.
p5
aVI've traveled north to the Arctic to the capture the unfolding story
p6
aVof polar melt,
p7
aVand south to the Equator to document the subsequent rising seas.
p8
aVMost recently, I visited the icy coast of Greenland
p9
aVand the low-lying islands of the Maldives,
p10
aVconnecting two seemingly disparate but equally endangered
p11
aVparts of our planet.
p12
aa(lp13
VMy drawings explore moments of transition, turbulence
p14
aVand tranquility in the landscape,
p15
aVallowing viewers to emotionally connect
p16
aVwith a place you might never have the chance to visit.
p17
aVI choose to convey the beauty as opposed to the devastation.
p18
aVIf you can experience the sublimity of these landscapes,
p19
aVperhaps you'll be inspired to protect and preserve them.
p20
aa(lp21
VBehavioral psychology tells us that we take action
p22
aVand make decisions based on our emotions above all else.
p23
aVAnd studies have shown that art impacts our emotions
p24
aVmore effectively than a scary news report.
p25
aVExperts predict ice-free Arctic summers
p26
aVas early as 2020.
p27
aVAnd sea levels are likely to rise between two and ten feet
p28
aVby century's end.
p29
aVI have dedicated my career to illuminating these projections
p30
aVwith an accessible medium,
p31
aVone that moves us in a way that statistics may not.
p32
aa(lp33
VMy process begins with traveling to the places
p34
aVat the forefront of climate change.
p35
aVOn-site, I take thousands of photographs.
p36
aVBack in the studio,
p37
aVI work from both my memory of the experience and the photographs
p38
aVto create very large-scale compositions,
p39
aVsometimes over 10 feet wide.
p40
aa(lp41
VI draw with soft pastel, which is dry like charcoal, but colors.
p42
aVI consider my work drawings but others call them painting.
p43
aVI cringe, though, when I'm referred to as a "finger painter."
p44
aa(lp45
V(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VBut I don't use any tools
p48
aVand I have always used my fingers and palms
p49
aVto manipulate the pigment on the paper.
p50
aVDrawing is a form of meditation for me.
p51
aVIt quiets my mind.
p52
aVI don't perceive what I'm drawing
p53
aVas ice or water.
p54
aVInstead, the image is stripped down
p55
aVto its most basic form of color and shape.
p56
aVOnce the piece is complete,
p57
aVI can finally experience the composition as a whole,
p58
aVas an iceberg floating through glassy water,
p59
aVor a wave cresting with foam.
p60
aVOn average, a piece this size takes me about,
p61
aVas you can see, 10 seconds.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
V(Applause)
p66
aa(lp67
VReally, more like 200 hours, 250 hours for something that size.
p68
aVBut I've been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon, really.
p69
aVMy mom was an artist, and growing up,
p70
aVwe always had art supplies all over the house.
p71
aVMy mother's love of photography
p72
aVpropelled her to the most remote regions of the earth,
p73
aVand my family and I were fortunate enough
p74
aVto join and support her on these adventures.
p75
aVWe rode camels in Northern Africa
p76
aVand mushed on dog sleds near the North Pole.
p77
aa(lp78
VIn August of 2012, I led my first expedition,
p79
aVtaking a group of artists and scholars up the northwest coast of Greenland.
p80
aVMy mother was originally supposed to lead this trip.
p81
aVShe and I were in the early stages of planning,
p82
aVas we had intended to go together,
p83
aVwhen she fell victim to a brain tumor.
p84
aVThe cancer quickly took over her body and mind,
p85
aVand she passed away six months later.
p86
aVDuring the months of her illness, though,
p87
aVher dedication to the expedition never wavered, and I made a promise
p88
aVto carry out her final journey.
p89
aa(lp90
VMy mother's passion for the Arctic
p91
aVechoed through my experience in Greenland,
p92
aVand I felt the power
p93
aVand the fragility of the landscape.
p94
aVThe sheer size of the icebergs
p95
aVis humbling.
p96
aVThe ice fields are alive with movement and sound
p97
aVin a way that I never expected.
p98
aVI expanded the scale of my compositions
p99
aVto give you that same sense of awe that I experienced.
p100
aVYet, while the grandeur of the ice is evident,
p101
aVso, too, is its vulnerability.
p102
aVFrom our boat,
p103
aVI could see the ice sweating under the unseasonably warm sun.
p104
aa(lp105
VWe had a chance to visit many of the Inuit communities in Greenland
p106
aVthat now face huge challenges.
p107
aVThe locals spoke to me of vast areas of sea ice
p108
aVthat are no longer freezing over as they once did.
p109
aVAnd without ice, their hunting and harvesting grounds
p110
aVare severely diminished,
p111
aVthreatening their way of life and survival.
p112
aa(lp113
VThe melting glaciers in Greenland
p114
aVare one of the largest contributing factors to rising sea levels,
p115
aVwhich have already begun to drown
p116
aVsome of our world's lowest-lying islands.
p117
aVOne year after my trip to Greenland, I visited the Maldives,
p118
aVthe lowest and flattest country in the entire world.
p119
aVWhile I was there, I collected images and inspiration
p120
aVfor a new body of work:
p121
aVdrawings of waves lapping on the coast of a nation
p122
aVthat could be entirely underwater within this century.
p123
aa(lp124
VDevastating events happen every day
p125
aVon scales both global and personal.
p126
aVWhen I was in Greenland,
p127
aVI scattered my mother's ashes amidst the melting ice.
p128
aVNow she remains a part of the landscape she loved so much,
p129
aVeven as it, too, passes and takes on new form.
p130
aa(lp131
VAmong the many gifts my mother gave me
p132
aVwas the ability to focus on the positive,
p133
aVrather than the negative.
p134
aVMy drawings celebrate the beauty of what we all stand to lose.
p135
aVI hope they can serve as records of sublime landscapes in flux,
p136
aVdocumenting the transition and inspiring our global community
p137
aVto take action for the future.
p138
aa(lp139
VThank you.
