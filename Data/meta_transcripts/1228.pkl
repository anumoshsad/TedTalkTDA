VI am a reformed marketer,
p4
aVand I now work in international development.
p5
aVIn October, I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
p6
aVwhich is the [second] largest country in Africa.
p7
aVIn fact, it's as large as Western Europe,
p8
aVbut it only has 300 miles of paved roads.
p9
aVThe DRC is a dangerous place.
p10
aVIn the past 10 years, five million people have died
p11
aVdue to a war in the east.
p12
aVBut war isn't the only reason
p13
aVthat life is difficult in the DRC.
p14
aa(lp15
VThere are many health issues as well.
p16
aVIn fact, the HIV prevalence rate
p17
aVis 1.3 percent among adults.
p18
aVThis might not sound like a large number,
p19
aVbut in a country with 76 million people,
p20
aVit means there are 930,000 that are infected.
p21
aVAnd due to the poor infrastructure,
p22
aVonly 25 percent of those
p23
aVare receiving the life-saving drugs that they need.
p24
aVWhich is why, in part,
p25
aVdonor agencies provide condoms
p26
aVat low or no cost.
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd so while I was in the DRC,
p29
aVI spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms,
p30
aVincluding Damien.
p31
aVDamien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa.
p32
aVIt's a hotel that's only open until midnight,
p33
aVso it's not a place that you stay.
p34
aVBut it is a place where sex workers and their clients come.
p35
aVNow Damien knows all about condoms,
p36
aVbut he doesn't sell them.
p37
aVHe said there's just not in demand.
p38
aVIt's not surprising,
p39
aVbecause only three percent of people in the DRC
p40
aVuse condoms.
p41
aa(lp42
VJoseph and Christine,
p43
aVwho run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms,
p44
aVsaid despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost,
p45
aVand they have marketing campaigns that go along with them,
p46
aVtheir customers don't buy the branded versions.
p47
aVThey like the generics.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd as a marketer, I found that curious.
p50
aVAnd so I started to look at what the marketing looked like.
p51
aVAnd it turns out that there are three main messages
p52
aVused by the donor agencies for these condoms:
p53
aVfear, financing and fidelity.
p54
aVThey name the condoms things like Vive, "to live"
p55
aVor Trust.
p56
aVThey package it with the red ribbon
p57
aVthat reminds us of HIV,
p58
aVput it in boxes that remind you who paid for them,
p59
aVshow pictures of your wife or husband
p60
aVand tell you to protect them
p61
aVor to act prudently.
p62
aa(lp63
VNow these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about
p64
aVjust before they go get a condom.
p65
aV(Laughter)
p66
aVWhat is it that you think about
p67
aVjust before you get a condom?
p68
aVSex!
p69
aVAnd the private companies that sell condoms in these places,
p70
aVthey understand this.
p71
aVTheir marketing is slightly different.
p72
aVThe name might not be much different,
p73
aVbut the imagery sure is.
p74
aVSome brands are aspirational,
p75
aVand certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative.
p76
aa(lp77
VAnd this made me think
p78
aVthat perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out
p79
aVon a key aspect of marketing:
p80
aVunderstanding who's the audience.
p81
aVAnd for donor agencies, unfortunately,
p82
aVthe audience tends to be
p83
aVpeople that aren't even in the country they're working [in].
p84
aVIt's people back home,
p85
aVpeople that support their work,
p86
aVpeople like these.
p87
aVBut if what we're really trying to do
p88
aVis stop the spread of HIV,
p89
aVwe need to think about the customer,
p90
aVthe people whose behavior needs to change \u2014
p91
aVthe couples,
p92
aVthe young women, the young men \u2014
p93
aVwhose lives depend on it.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd so the lesson is this:
p96
aVit doesn't really matter what you're selling;
p97
aVyou just have to think about who is your customer,
p98
aVand what are the messages
p99
aVthat are going to get them to change their behavior.
p100
aVIt might just save their lives.
p101

VThank you.
