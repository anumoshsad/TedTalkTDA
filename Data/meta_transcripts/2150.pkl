VWhen we think about mapping cities,
p4
aVwe tend to think about roads and streets and buildings,
p5
aVand the settlement narrative that led to their creation,
p6
aVor you might think about the bold vision of an urban designer,
p7
aVbut there's other ways to think about mapping cities
p8
aVand how they got to be made.
p9
aVToday, I want to show you a new kind of map.
p10
aVThis is not a geographic map.
p11
aVThis is a map of the relationships  between people in my hometown
p12
aVof Baltimore, Maryland,
p13
aVand what you can see here is that each dot represents a person,
p14
aVeach line represents a relationship between those people,
p15
aVand each color represents a community within the network.
p16
aa(lp17
VNow, I'm here on the green side, down on the far right where the geeks are,
p18
aVand TEDx also is down  on the far right. (Laughter)
p19
aVNow, on the other side of the network,
p20
aVyou tend to have primarily African-American and Latino folks
p21
aVwho are really concerned about somewhat different things than the geeks are,
p22
aVbut just to give some sense,
p23
aVthe green part of the network  we call Smalltimore,
p24
aVfor those of us that inhabit it,
p25
aVbecause it seems as though we're living in a very small town.
p26
aVWe see the same people over and over again,
p27
aVbut that's because we're not really exploring
p28
aVthe full depth and breadth of the city.
p29
aVOn the other end of the network,
p30
aVyou have folks who are interested in things like hip-hop music
p31
aVand they even identify with living in the DC/Maryland/Virginia area
p32
aVover, say, the Baltimore city designation proper.
p33
aVBut in the middle, you see that there's
p34
aVsomething that connects the two communities together,
p35
aVand that's sports.
p36
aVWe have the Baltimore Orioles, the Baltimore Ravens football team,
p37
aVMichael Phelps, the Olympian.
p38
aVUnder Armour, you may have heard of, is a Baltimore company,
p39
aVand that community of sports acts as the only bridge
p40
aVbetween these two ends of the network.
p41
aa(lp42
VLet's take a look at San Francisco.
p43
aVYou see something a little bit different happening in San Francisco.
p44
aVOn the one hand, you do have the media, politics and news lobe
p45
aVthat tends to exist in Baltimore and other cities,
p46
aVbut you also have this very predominant group
p47
aVof geeks and techies that are sort of taking over the top half of the network,
p48
aVand there's even a group that's so distinct and clear
p49
aVthat we can identify it as Twitter employees,
p50
aVnext to the geeks, in between the gamers and the geeks,
p51
aVat the opposite end of the hip-hop spectrum.
p52
aVSo you can see, though,
p53
aVthat the tensions that we've heard about in San Francisco
p54
aVin terms of people being concerned about gentrification
p55
aVand all the new tech companies that are bringing new wealth
p56
aVand settlement into the city are real,
p57
aVand you can actually see that documented here.
p58
aVYou can see the LGBT community
p59
aVis not really getting along with the geek community that well,
p60
aVthe arts community, the music community.
p61
aVAnd so it leads to things like this.
p62
aV["Evict Twitter"]
p63
aVSomebody sent me this photo a few weeks ago,
p64
aVand it shows what is happening on the ground in San Francisco,
p65
aVand I think you can actually try to understand that
p66
aVthrough looking at a map like this.
p67
aa(lp68
VLet's take a look at Rio de Janeiro.
p69
aVI spent the last few weeks gathering data about Rio,
p70
aVand one of the things that stood out to me about this city
p71
aVis that everything's really kind of mixed up.
p72
aVIt's a very heterogenous city in a way  that Baltimore or San Francisco is not.
p73
aVYou still have the lobe of people involved
p74
aVwith government, newspapers, politics, columnists.
p75
aVTEDxRio is down in the lower right, right next to bloggers and writers.
p76
aVBut then you also have this tremendous diversity of people
p77
aVthat are interested in different kinds of music.
p78
aVEven Justin Bieber fans are represented here.
p79
aVOther boy bands, country singers,
p80
aVgospel music, funk and rap and stand-up comedy,
p81
aVand there's even a whole section around drugs and jokes.
p82
aVHow cool is that?
p83
aVAnd then the Flamengo football team is also represented here.
p84
aVSo you have that same kind of spread
p85
aVof sports and civics and the arts and music,
p86
aVbut it's represented in a very different way,
p87
aVand I think that maybe fits with our understanding of Rio
p88
aVas being a very multicultural, musically diverse city.
p89
aa(lp90
VSo we have all this data.
p91
aVIt's an incredibly rich set of data that we have about cities now,
p92
aVmaybe even richer than any data set that we've ever had before.
p93
aVSo what can we do with it?
p94
aVWell, I think the first thing that we can try to understand
p95
aVis that segregation is a social construct.
p96
aVIt's something that we choose to do, and we could choose not to do it,
p97
aVand if you kind of think about it,
p98
aVwhat we're doing with this data is aiming a space telescope at a city
p99
aVand looking at it as if was a giant high school cafeteria,
p100
aVand seeing how everybody arranged themselves in a seating chart.
p101
aVWell maybe it's time to shake up the seating chart a little bit.
p102
aa(lp103
VThe other thing that we start to realize
p104
aVis that race is a really poor proxy for diversity.
p105
aVWe've got people represented from all different types of races
p106
aVacross the entire map here \u2014
p107
aVonly looking at race
p108
aVdoesn't really contribute to our development of diversity.
p109
aVSo if we're trying to use diversity
p110
aVas a way to tackle some of our more intractable problems,
p111
aVwe need to start to think  about diversity in a new way.
p112
aa(lp113
VAnd lastly, we have the ability to create
p114
aVinterventions to start to reshape our cities in a new way,
p115
aVand I believe that if we have that capability,
p116
aVwe may even bear some responsibility to do so.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo what is a city?
p119
aVI think some might say that it is
p120
aVa geographical area or a collection of streets and buildings,
p121
aVbut I believe that a city  is the sum of the relationships
p122
aVof the people that live there,
p123
aVand I believe that if we can start to document those relationships in a real way
p124
aVthen maybe we have a real shot
p125
aVat creating those kinds of cities that we'd like to have.
p126
