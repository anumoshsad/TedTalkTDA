VLet's pretend right here we have a machine.
p4
aVA big machine, a cool, TED-ish machine,
p5
aVand it's a time machine.
p6
aVAnd everyone in this room has to get into it.
p7
aVAnd you can go backwards, you can go forwards;
p8
aVyou cannot stay where you are.
p9
aVAnd I wonder what you'd choose, because I've been asking my friends
p10
aVthis question a lot lately and they all want to go back.
p11
aVI don't know. They want to go back before there were automobiles
p12
aVor Twitter or "American Idol."
p13
aVI don't know.
p14
aVI'm convinced that there's some sort of pull
p15
aVto nostalgia, to wishful thinking.
p16
aVAnd I understand that.
p17
aa(lp18
VI'm not part of that crowd, I have to say.
p19
aVI don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm adventurous.
p20
aVIt's because possibilities on this planet,
p21
aVthey don't go back, they go forward.
p22
aVSo I want to get in the machine, and I want to go forward.
p23
aVThis is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet
p24
aVby any measure that you wish to choose:
p25
aVhealth, wealth,
p26
aVmobility, opportunity,
p27
aVdeclining rates of disease ...
p28
aVThere's never been a time like this.
p29
aVMy great-grandparents died, all of them,
p30
aVby the time they were 60.
p31
aVMy grandparents pushed that number to 70.
p32
aVMy parents are closing in on 80.
p33
aVSo there better be
p34
aVa nine at the beginning of my death number.
p35
aVBut it's not even about people like us,
p36
aVbecause this is a bigger deal than that.
p37
aa(lp38
VA kid born in New Delhi today
p39
aVcan expect to live as long as
p40
aVthe richest man in the world did 100 years ago.
p41
aVThink about that, it's an incredible fact.
p42
aVAnd why is it true?
p43
aVSmallpox. Smallpox killed billions
p44
aVof people on this planet.
p45
aVIt reshaped the demography of the globe
p46
aVin a way that no war ever has.
p47
aVIt's gone. It's vanished.
p48
aVWe vanquished it. Puff.
p49
aVIn the rich world,
p50
aVdiseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago
p51
aVno longer exist, hardly.
p52
aVDiphtheria, rubella, polio ...
p53
aVdoes anyone even know what those things are?
p54
aVVaccines, modern medicine,
p55
aVour ability to feed billions of people,
p56
aVthose are triumphs of the scientific method.
p57
aVAnd to my mind, the scientific method \u2014
p58
aVtrying stuff out,
p59
aVseeing if it works, changing it when it doesn't \u2014
p60
aVis one of the great accomplishments of humanity.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo that's the good news.
p63
aVUnfortunately, that's all the good news
p64
aVbecause there are some other problems, and they've been mentioned many times.
p65
aVAnd one of them is that
p66
aVdespite all our accomplishments,
p67
aVa billion people go to bed hungry
p68
aVin this world every day.
p69
aVThat number's rising, and it's rising really rapidly, and it's disgraceful.
p70
aVAnd not only that, we've used our imagination
p71
aVto thoroughly trash this globe.
p72
aVPotable water, arable land,
p73
aVrainforests, oil, gas:
p74
aVthey're going away, and they're going away soon,
p75
aVand unless we innovate our way out of this mess,
p76
aVwe're going away too.
p77
aa(lp78
VSo the question is: Can we do that? And I think we can.
p79
aVI think it's clear that we can make food
p80
aVthat will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on.
p81
aVI think we can power this world with energy
p82
aVthat doesn't also destroy it.
p83
aVI really do believe that, and, no, it ain't wishful thinking.
p84
aVBut here's the thing that keeps me up at night \u2014
p85
aVone of the things that keeps me up at night:
p86
aVWe've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now. Never.
p87
aVAnd we've also never been in a position
p88
aVto deploy it properly in the way that we can today.
p89
aVWe're on the verge of amazing, amazing events
p90
aVin many fields,
p91
aVand yet I actually think we'd have to go back
p92
aVhundreds, 300 years, before the Enlightenment,
p93
aVto find a time when we battled progress,
p94
aVwhen we fought about these things
p95
aVmore vigorously, on more fronts, than we do now.
p96
aa(lp97
VPeople wrap themselves in their beliefs,
p98
aVand they do it so tightly that you can't set them free.
p99
aVNot even the truth will set them free.
p100
aVAnd, listen, everyone's entitled to their opinion;
p101
aVthey're even entitled to their opinion about progress.
p102
aVBut you know what you're not entitled to?
p103
aVYou're not entitled to your own facts. Sorry, you're not.
p104
aVAnd this took me awhile to figure out.
p105
aa(lp106
VAbout a decade ago, I wrote a story about vaccines
p107
aVfor The New Yorker. A little story.
p108
aVAnd I was amazed to find opposition:
p109
aVopposition to what is, after all,
p110
aVthe most effective public health measure in human history.
p111
aVI didn't know what to do,
p112
aVso I just did what I do: I wrote a story and I moved on.
p113
aVAnd soon after that,
p114
aVI wrote a story about genetically engineered food.
p115
aVSame thing, only bigger.
p116
aVPeople were going crazy.
p117
aVSo I wrote a story about that too,
p118
aVand I couldn't understand why
p119
aVpeople thought this was "Frankenfoods,"
p120
aVwhy they thought moving molecules around
p121
aVin a specific, rather than a haphazard way,
p122
aVwas trespassing on nature's ground.
p123
aVBut, you know, I do what I do. I wrote the story, I moved on.
p124
aVI mean, I'm a journalist.
p125
aVWe type, we file, we go to dinner. It's fine.
p126
aa(lp127
V(Laughter)
p128
aa(lp129
VBut these stories bothered me,
p130
aVand I couldn't figure out why, and eventually I did.
p131
aVAnd that's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy
p132
aVweren't actually fanatics at all.
p133
aVThey were thoughtful people, educated people, decent people.
p134
aVThey were exactly like the people in this room.
p135
aVAnd it just disturbed me so much.
p136
aVBut then I thought, you know, let's be honest.
p137
aVWe're at a point in this world
p138
aVwhere we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to.
p139
aVWe talk about it ambivalently.
p140
aVWe talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it:
p141
aV"progress."
p142
aVOkay, there are reasons for that, and I think we know what those reasons are.
p143
aVWe've lost faith in institutions,
p144
aVin authority,
p145
aVand sometimes in science itself,
p146
aVand there's no reason we shouldn't have.
p147
aVYou can just say a few names
p148
aVand people will understand.
p149
aVChernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger,
p150
aVVioxx, weapons of mass destruction,
p151
aVhanging chads.
p152
aVYou know, you can choose your list.
p153
aVThere are questions and problems
p154
aVwith the people we used to believe were always right,
p155
aVso be skeptical.
p156
aVAsk questions, demand proof, demand evidence.
p157
aVDon't take anything for granted.
p158
aVBut here's the thing: When you get proof,
p159
aVyou need to accept the proof, and we're not that good at doing that.
p160
aVAnd the reason that I can say that is because
p161
aVwe're now in an epidemic of fear
p162
aVlike one I've never seen and hope never to see again.
p163
aa(lp164
VAbout 12 years ago, there was a story published,
p165
aVa horrible story,
p166
aVthat linked the epidemic of autism
p167
aVto the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine shot.
p168
aVVery scary.
p169
aVTons of studies were done to see if this was true.
p170
aVTons of studies should have been done; it's a serious issue.
p171
aVThe data came back.
p172
aVThe data came back from the United States, from England,
p173
aVfrom Sweden, from Canada,
p174
aVand it was all the same: no correlation,
p175
aVno connection, none at all.
p176
aVIt doesn't matter. It doesn't matter
p177
aVbecause we believe anecdotes,
p178
aVwe believe what we see, what we think we see,
p179
aVwhat makes us feel real.
p180
aVWe don't believe a bunch of documents
p181
aVfrom a government official giving us data,
p182
aVand I do understand that, I think we all do.
p183
aVBut you know what?
p184
aVThe result of that has been disastrous.
p185
aVDisastrous because here's a fact:
p186
aVThe United States is one of the only countries in the world
p187
aVwhere the vaccine rate for measles is going down.
p188
aVThat is disgraceful,
p189
aVand we should be ashamed of ourselves.
p190
aVIt's horrible.
p191
aVWhat kind of a thing happened
p192
aVthat we could do that?
p193
aa(lp194
VNow, I understand it. I do understand it.
p195
aVBecause, did anyone have measles here?
p196
aVHas one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles?
p197
aVDoesn't happen very much.
p198
aVDoesn't happen in this country at all,
p199
aVbut it happened 160,000 times in the world last year.
p200
aVThat's a lot of death of measles \u2014
p201
aV20 an hour.
p202
aVBut since it didn't happen here, we can put it out of our minds,
p203
aVand people like Jenny McCarthy
p204
aVcan go around preaching messages
p205
aVof fear and illiteracy from platforms
p206
aVlike "Oprah" and "Larry King Live."
p207
aVAnd they can do it because
p208
aVthey don't link causation and correlation.
p209
aVThey don't understand that these things seem the same,
p210
aVbut they're almost never the same.
p211
aVAnd it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn it really soon.
p212
aa(lp213
VThis guy was a hero, Jonas Salk.
p214
aVHe took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us.
p215
aVNo fear, no agony. Polio \u2014 puff, gone.
p216
aVThat guy in the middle, not so much.
p217
aVHis name is Paul Offit.
p218
aVHe just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people.
p219
aVIt'll save the lives of 400 to 500,000 kids
p220
aVin the developing world every year.
p221
aVPretty good, right?
p222
aVWell, it's good, except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines
p223
aVand says how valuable they are
p224
aVand that people ought to just stop the whining.
p225
aVAnd he actually says it that way.
p226
aVSo, Paul's a terrorist.
p227
aVWhen Paul speaks in a public hearing,
p228
aVhe can't testify without armed guards.
p229
aVHe gets called at home
p230
aVbecause people like to tell him
p231
aVthat they remember where his kids go to school.
p232
aVAnd why? Because Paul made a vaccine.
p233
aa(lp234
VI don't need to say this, but vaccines are essential.
p235
aVYou take them away, disease comes back,
p236
aVhorrible diseases. And that's happening.
p237
aVWe have measles in this country now.
p238
aVAnd it's getting worse, and pretty soon kids
p239
aVare going to die of it again because it's just a numbers game.
p240
aVAnd they're not just going to die of measles.
p241
aVWhat about polio? Let's have that. Why not?
p242
aVA college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said
p243
aVshe thought I was a little strident.
p244
aVNo one's ever said that before.
p245
aVShe wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio,
p246
aVno way.
p247
aVFine.
p248
aVWhy? Because we don't have polio. And you know what?
p249
aVWe didn't have polio in this country yesterday.
p250
aVToday, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning,
p251
aVand he's flying to LAX, right now he's over Ohio.
p252
aVAnd he's going to land in a couple of hours, he's going to rent a car,
p253
aVand he's going to come to Long Beach,
p254
aVand he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight.
p255
aVAnd he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease,
p256
aVand we don't either because that's the way the world works.
p257
aVThat's the planet we live on. Don't pretend it isn't.
p258
aa(lp259
VNow, we love to wrap ourselves in lies. We love to do it.
p260
aVEveryone take their vitamins this morning?
p261
aVEchinacea, a little antioxidant
p262
aVto get you going.
p263
aVI know you did because half of Americans do every day.
p264
aVThey take the stuff, and they take alternative medicines,
p265
aVand it doesn't matter how often
p266
aVwe find out that they're useless.
p267
aVThe data says it all the time.
p268
aVThey darken your urine. They almost never do more than that.
p269
aV(Laughter)
p270
aVIt's okay, you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine?
p271
aVI'm totally with you.
p272
aV(Laughter)
p273
aVDark urine. Dark.
p274
aVWhy do we do that? Why do we do that?
p275
aVWell, I think I understand, we hate Big Pharma.
p276
aVWe hate Big Government. We don't trust the Man.
p277
aVAnd we shouldn't: Our health care system sucks.
p278
aVIt's cruel to millions of people.
p279
aVIt's absolutely astonishingly cold
p280
aVand soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it.
p281
aVSo we run away from it, and where do we run?
p282
aVWe leap into the arms of Big Placebo.
p283
aV(Laughter)
p284
aVThat's fantastic. I love Big Placebo.
p285
aV(Applause)
p286
aa(lp287
VBut, you know, it's really a serious thing
p288
aVbecause this stuff is crap,
p289
aVand we spend billions of dollars on it.
p290
aVAnd I have all sorts of little props here.
p291
aVNone of it ... ginkgo, fraud;
p292
aVechinacea, fraud;
p293
aVacai \u2014 I don't even know what that is
p294
aVbut we're spending billions of dollars on it \u2014 it's fraud.
p295
aVAnd you know what? When I say this stuff, people scream at me,
p296
aVand they say, "What do you care? Let people do what they want to do.
p297
aVIt makes them feel good."
p298
aVAnd you know what? You're wrong.
p299
aVBecause I don't care
p300
aVif it's the secretary of HHS
p301
aVwho's saying, "Hmm, I'm not going to take the evidence
p302
aVof my experts on mammograms,"
p303
aVor some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient
p304
aVwith coffee enemas.
p305
aVWhen you start down the road
p306
aVwhere belief and magic replace evidence and science,
p307
aVyou end up in a place you don't want to be.
p308
aVYou end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa.
p309
aVHe killed 400,000 of his people
p310
aVby insisting that beetroot,
p311
aVgarlic and lemon oil
p312
aVwere much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs
p313
aVwe know can slow the course of AIDS.
p314
aVHundreds of thousands of needless deaths
p315
aVin a country that has been plagued
p316
aVworse than any other by this disease.
p317
aVPlease, don't tell me
p318
aVthere are no consequences to these things.
p319
aVThere are. There always are.
p320
aa(lp321
VNow, the most mindless epidemic
p322
aVwe're in the middle of right now
p323
aVis this absurd battle
p324
aVbetween proponents of genetically engineered food
p325
aVand the organic elite.
p326
aVIt's an idiotic debate. It has to stop.
p327
aVIt's a debate about words, about metaphors.
p328
aVIt's ideology, it's not science.
p329
aVEvery single thing we eat, every grain of rice,
p330
aVevery sprig of parsley,
p331
aVevery Brussels sprout
p332
aVhas been modified by man.
p333
aVYou know, there weren't tangerines in the garden of Eden.
p334
aVThere wasn't any cantaloupe. (Laughter)
p335
aVThere weren't Christmas trees. We made it all.
p336
aVWe made it over the last 11,000 years.
p337
aVAnd some of it worked, and some of it didn't.
p338
aVWe got rid of the stuff that didn't.
p339
aVNow we can do it in a more precise way \u2014
p340
aVand there are risks, absolutely \u2014
p341
aVbut we can put something like vitamin A into rice,
p342
aVand that stuff can help millions of people,
p343
aVmillions of people, prolong their lives.
p344
aVYou don't want to do that?
p345
aVI have to say, I don't understand it.
p346
aa(lp347
VWe object to genetically engineered food.
p348
aVWhy do we do that?
p349
aVWell, the things I constantly hear are:
p350
aVToo many chemicals,
p351
aVpesticides, hormones,
p352
aVmonoculture, we don't want giant fields
p353
aVof the same thing, that's wrong.
p354
aVWe don't companies patenting life.
p355
aVWe don't want companies owning seeds.
p356
aVAnd you know what my response to all of that is?
p357
aVYes, you're right. Let's fix it.
p358
aVIt's true, we've got a huge food problem,
p359
aVbut this isn't science.
p360
aVThis has nothing to do with science.
p361
aVIt's law, it's morality, it's patent stuff.
p362
aVYou know science isn't a company.
p363
aVIt's not a country.
p364
aVIt's not even an idea; it's a process.
p365
aVIt's a process, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't,
p366
aVbut the idea that we should not allow
p367
aVscience to do its job
p368
aVbecause we're afraid,
p369
aVis really very deadening,
p370
aVand it's preventing millions of people
p371
aVfrom prospering.
p372
aa(lp373
VYou know, in the next 50 years
p374
aVwe're going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now,
p375
aV70 percent.
p376
aVThis investment in Africa over the last 30 years.
p377
aVDisgraceful. Disgraceful.
p378
aVThey need it, and we're not giving it to them.
p379
aVAnd why? Genetically engineered food.
p380
aVWe don't want to encourage people
p381
aVto eat that rotten stuff, like cassava for instance.
p382
aVCassava's something that half a billion people eat.
p383
aVIt's kind of like a potato.
p384
aVIt's just a bunch of calories. It sucks.
p385
aVIt doesn't have nutrients, it doesn't have protein,
p386
aVand scientists are engineering
p387
aVall of that into it right now.
p388
aVAnd then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind.
p389
aVThey wouldn't starve, and you know what?
p390
aVThat would be nice. It wouldn't be Chez Panisse,
p391
aVbut it would be nice.
p392
aa(lp393
VAnd all I can say about this is:
p394
aVWhy are we fighting it?
p395
aVI mean, let's ask ourselves: Why are we fighting it?
p396
aVBecause we don't want to move genes around?
p397
aVThis is about moving genes around. It's not about chemicals.
p398
aVIt's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones,
p399
aVour insistence on having bigger food,
p400
aVbetter food, singular food.
p401
aVThis isn't about Rice Krispies,
p402
aVthis is about keeping people alive,
p403
aVand it's about time we started to understand what that meant.
p404
aVBecause, you know something?
p405
aVIf we don't, if we continue to act the way we're acting,
p406
aVwe're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of:
p407
aVhigh-tech colonialism.
p408
aVThere's no other way to describe what's going on here.
p409
aVIt's selfish, it's ugly,
p410
aVit's beneath us,
p411
aVand we really have to stop it.
p412
aa(lp413
VSo after this amazingly fun conversation,
p414
aV(Laughter)
p415
aVyou might want to say, "So, you still want to get in this
p416
aVridiculous time machine and go forward?"
p417
aVAbsolutely. Absolutely, I do.
p418
aVIt's stuck in the present right now,
p419
aVbut we have an amazing opportunity.
p420
aVWe can set that time machine on anything we want.
p421
aVWe can move it where we want to move it,
p422
aVand we're going to move it where we want to move it.
p423
aVWe have to have these conversations and we have to think,
p424
aVbut when we get in the time machine and we go ahead,
p425
aVwe're going to be happy we do.
p426
aVI know that we can,
p427
aVand as far as I'm concerned,
p428
aVthat's something the world needs right now.
