VThis summer I was back in Ohio for a family wedding,
p4
aVand when I was there,
p5
aVthere was a meet and greet with Anna and Elsa from "Frozen."
p6
aVNot the Anna and Elsa from "Frozen,"
p7
aVas this was not a Disney-sanctioned event.
p8
aVThese two entrepreneurs had a business of running princess parties.
p9
aVYour kid is turning five?
p10
aVThey'll come sing some songs, sprinkle some fairy dust, it's great.
p11
aVAnd they were not about to miss out on the opportunity
p12
aVthat was the phenomenon and that was "Frozen."
p13
aa(lp14
VSo they get hired by a local toy store,
p15
aVkids come in on a Saturday morning,
p16
aVbuy some Disney swag, get their picture taken with the princesses,
p17
aVcall it a day.
p18
aVIt's like Santa Claus without the seasonal restrictions.
p19
aV(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VAnd my three-and-a-half-year-old niece Samantha was in the thick of it.
p22
aVShe could care less that these two women were signing posters and coloring books
p23
aVas Snow Queen and Princess Ana with one N to avoid copyright lawsuits.
p24
aV(Laughter)
p25
aVAccording to my niece and the 200-plus kids in the parking lot that day,
p26
aVthis was the Anna and Elsa from "Frozen."
p27
aa(lp28
VIt is a blazing hot Saturday morning in August in Ohio.
p29
aVWe get there at 10 o'clock, the scheduled start time,
p30
aVand we are handed number 59.
p31
aVBy 11 o'clock they had called numbers 21 through 25;
p32
aVthis was going to be a while,
p33
aVand there is no amount of free face painting or temporary tattoos
p34
aVthat could prevent the meltdowns that were occurring outside of the store.
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aa(lp37
VSo, by 12:30 we get called:
p38
aV"56 to 63, please."
p39
aVAnd as we walk in, it is a scene I can only describe you
p40
aVas saying it looked like Norway threw up.
p41
aV(Laughter)
p42
aVThere were cardboard cut-out snowflakes covering the floor,
p43
aVglitter on every flat surface, and icicles all over the walls.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd as we stood in line
p46
aVin an attempt to give my niece a better vantage point
p47
aVthan the backside of the mother of number 58,
p48
aVI put her up on my shoulders,
p49
aVand she was instantly riveted by the sight of the princesses.
p50
aVAnd as we moved forward, her excitement only grew,
p51
aVand as we finally got to the front of the line,
p52
aVand number 58 unfurled her poster to be signed by the princesses,
p53
aVI could literally feel the excitement running through her body.
p54
aVAnd let's be honest, at that point, I was pretty excited too.
p55
aV(Laughter)
p56
aVI mean, the Scandinavian decadence was mesmerizing.
p57
aV(Laughter)
p58
aa(lp59
VSo we get to the front of the line,
p60
aVand the haggard clerk turns to my niece and says,
p61
aV"Hi, honey. You're next!
p62
aVDo you want to get down, or you're going to stay
p63
aVon your dad's shoulders for the picture?'
p64
aV(Laughter)
p65
aVAnd I was, for a lack of a better word, frozen.
p66
aV(Laughter)
p67
aa(lp68
VIt's amazing that in an unexpected instant we are faced with the question,
p69
aVwho am I?
p70
aVAm I an aunt? Or am I an advocate?
p71
aVMillions of people have seen my video about how to have a hard conversation,
p72
aVand there one was, right in front of me.
p73
aVAt the same time,
p74
aVthere's nothing more important to me than the kids in my life,
p75
aVso I found myself in a situation that we so often find ourselves in,
p76
aVtorn between two things, two impossible choices.
p77
aVWould I be an advocate?
p78
aVWould I take my niece off my shoulders and turn to the clerk and explain to her
p79
aVthat I was in fact her aunt, not her father,
p80
aVand that she should be more careful
p81
aVand not to jump to gender conclusions based on haircuts and shoulder rides \u2014
p82
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p83
aVand while doing that,
p84
aVmiss out on what was, to this point, the greatest moment of my niece's life.
p85
aVOr would I be an aunt?
p86
aVWould I brush off that comment, take a million pictures,
p87
aVand not be distracted for an instant from the pure joy of that moment,
p88
aVand by doing that,
p89
aVwalk out with the shame that comes up for not standing up for myself,
p90
aVespecially in front of my niece.
p91
aa(lp92
VWho was I?
p93
aVWhich one was more important? Which role was more worth it?
p94
aVWas I an aunt? Or was I an advocate?
p95
aVAnd I had a split second to decide.
p96
aa(lp97
VWe are taught right now
p98
aVthat we are living in a world of constant and increasing polarity.
p99
aVIt's so black and white, so us and them, so right and wrong.
p100
aVThere is no middle, there is no gray, just polarity.
p101
aVPolarity is a state in which two ideas or opinions
p102
aVare completely opposite from each other;
p103
aVa diametrical opposition.
p104
aVWhich side are you on?
p105
aVAre you unequivocally and without question antiwar, pro-choice, anti-death penalty,
p106
aVpro-gun regulation, proponent of open borders and pro-union?
p107
aVOr, are you absolutely  and uncompromisingly
p108
aVpro-war, pro-life, pro-death penalty,
p109
aVa believer that the Second Amendment is absolute,
p110
aVanti-immigrant and pro-business?
p111
aVIt's all or none, you're with us or against us.
p112
aVThat is polarity.
p113
aa(lp114
VThe problem with polarity  and absolutes is that
p115
aVit eliminates the individuality of our human experience
p116
aVand that makes it contradictory to our human nature.
p117
aVBut if we are pulled in these two directions,
p118
aVbut it's not really where we exist \u2014
p119
aVpolarity is not our actual reality \u2014
p120
aVwhere do we go from there?
p121
aVWhat's at the other end of that spectrum?
p122
aa(lp123
VI don't think it's an unattainable, harmonious utopia,
p124
aVI think the opposite of polarity is duality.
p125
aVDuality is a state of having two parts,
p126
aVbut not in diametrical opposition,
p127
aVin simultaneous existence.
p128
aVDon't think it's possible?
p129
aVHere are the people I know:
p130
aVI know Catholics who are pro-choice, and feminists who wear hijabs,
p131
aVand veterans who are antiwar,
p132
aVand NRA members who think I should be able to get married.
p133
aVThose are the people I know, those are my friends and family,
p134
aVthat is the majority of our society, that is you, that is me.
p135
aV(Applause)
p136
aVDuality is the ability to hold both things.
p137
aVBut the question is: Can we own our duality?
p138
aVCan we have the courage to hold both things?
p139
aa(lp140
VI work at a restaurant in town,
p141
aVI became really good friends with the busser.
p142
aVI was a server and we had  a great relationship,
p143
aVwe had a really great time together.
p144
aVHer Spanish was great
p145
aVbecause she was from Mexico.
p146
aV(Laughter)
p147
aVThat line actually went the other way.
p148
aVHer English was limited, but significantly better than my Spanish.
p149
aVBut we were united by our similarities,
p150
aVnot separated by our differences.
p151
aVAnd we were close, even though we came from very different worlds.
p152
aVShe was from Mexico,
p153
aVshe left her family behind so she could come here
p154
aVand afford them a better life back home.
p155
aVShe was a devout conservative Catholic,
p156
aVa believer in traditional family values,
p157
aVstereotypical roles of men and women,
p158
aVand I was, well, me.
p159
aV(Laughter)
p160
aa(lp161
VBut the things that bonded us were when she asked about my girlfriend,
p162
aVor she shared pictures that she had from her family back home.
p163
aVThose were the things that brought us together.
p164
aVSo one day, we were in the back,
p165
aVscarfing down food as quickly as we could, gathered around a small table,
p166
aVduring a very rare lull,
p167
aVand a new guy from the kitchen came over \u2014
p168
aVwho happened to be her cousin \u2014
p169
aVand sat down with all the bravado and machismo
p170
aVthat his 20-year-old body could hold.
p171
aV(Laughter)
p172
aVAnd he said to her, [in Spanish] "Does Ash have a boyfriend?"
p173
aVAnd she said, [in Spanish] "No, she has a girlfriend."
p174
aVAnd he said, [in Spanish] "A girlfriend?!?"
p175
aVAnd she set down her fork, and locked eyes with him,
p176
aVand said, [in Spanish] "Yes, a girlfriend. That is all."
p177
aVAnd his smug smile quickly dropped to one of maternal respect,
p178
aVgrabbed his plate, walked off, went back to work.
p179
aVShe never made eye contact with me.
p180
aVShe left, did the same thing \u2014
p181
aVit was a 10-second conversation, such a short interaction.
p182
aa(lp183
VAnd on paper, she had so much more in common with him:
p184
aVlanguage, culture, history, family, her community was her lifeline here,
p185
aVbut her moral compass trumped all of that.
p186
aVAnd a little bit later, they were joking around in the kitchen in Spanish,
p187
aVthat had nothing to do with me,
p188
aVand that is duality.
p189
aVShe didn't have to choose some P.C. stance on gayness over her heritage.
p190
aVShe didn't have to choose her family over our friendship.
p191
aVIt wasn't Jesus or Ash.
p192
aV(Laughter)
p193
aV(Applause)
p194
aa(lp195
VHer individual morality was so strongly rooted
p196
aVthat she had the courage to hold both things.
p197
aVOur moral integrity is our responsibility
p198
aVand we must be prepared to defend it even when it's not convenient.
p199
aVThat's what it means to be an ally, and if you're going to be an ally,
p200
aVyou have to be an active ally:
p201
aVAsk questions, act when you hear something inappropriate,
p202
aVactually engage.
p203
aa(lp204
VI had a family friend who for years used to call my girlfriend my lover.
p205
aVReally? Lover?
p206
aVSo overly sexual,
p207
aVso '70s gay porn.
p208
aV(Laughter)
p209
aVBut she was trying, and she asked.
p210
aVShe could have called her my friend,
p211
aVor my "friend," or my "special friend" \u2014
p212
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p213
aVor even worse, just not asked at all.
p214
aVBelieve me, we would rather have you ask.
p215
aVI would rather have her say lover, than say nothing at all.
p216
aa(lp217
VPeople often say to me, "Well, Ash, I don't care.
p218
aVI don't see race or religion or sexuality.
p219
aVIt doesn't matter to me. I don't see it."
p220
aVBut I think the opposite of homophobia and racism and xenophobia is not love,
p221
aVit's apathy.
p222
aVIf you don't see my gayness, then you don't see me.
p223
aVIf it doesn't matter to you who I sleep with,
p224
aVthen you cannot imagine what it feels like
p225
aVwhen I walk down the street late at night holding her hand,
p226
aVand approach a group of people and have to make the decision
p227
aVif I should hang on to it or if I should I drop it
p228
aVwhen all I want to do is squeeze it tighter.
p229
aVAnd the small victory I feel
p230
aVwhen I make it by and don't have to let go.
p231
aVAnd the incredible cowardice and disappointment I feel when I drop it.
p232
aVIf you do not see that struggle
p233
aVthat is unique to my human experience because I am gay, then you don't see me.
p234
aVIf you are going to be an ally, I need you to see me.
p235
aa(lp236
VAs individuals, as allies, as humans,
p237
aVwe need to be able to hold both things:
p238
aVboth the good and the bad,
p239
aVthe easy and the hard.
p240
aVYou don't learn how to hold two things just from the fluff,
p241
aVyou learn it from the grit.
p242
aVAnd what if duality is just the first step?
p243
aVWhat if through compassion and empathy and human interaction
p244
aVwe are able to learn to hold two things?
p245
aVAnd if we can hold two things, we can hold four,
p246
aVand if we can hold four, we can hold eight,
p247
aVand if we can hold eight, we can hold hundreds.
p248
aa(lp249
VWe are complex individuals,
p250
aVswirls of contradiction.
p251
aVYou are all holding so many things right now.
p252
aVWhat can you do to hold just a few more?
p253
aa(lp254
VSo, back to Toledo, Ohio.
p255
aVI'm at the front of the line,
p256
aVniece on my shoulders, the frazzled clerk calls me Dad.
p257
aVHave you ever been mistaken for the wrong gender?
p258
aVNot even that.
p259
aVHave you ever been called something you are not?
p260
aVHere's what it feels like for me:
p261
aVI am instantly an internal storm of contrasting emotions.
p262
aVI break out into a sweat that is a combination of rage and humiliation,
p263
aVI feel like the entire store is staring at me,
p264
aVand I simultaneously feel invisible.
p265
aVI want to explode in a tirade of fury,
p266
aVand I want to crawl under a rock.
p267
aVAnd top all of that off with the frustration that I'm wearing
p268
aVan out-of-character tight-fitting purple t-shirt,
p269
aVso this whole store can see my boobs,
p270
aVto make sure this exact same thing doesn't happen.
p271
aV(Laughter)
p272
aVBut, despite my best efforts to be seen as the gender I am,
p273
aVit still happens.
p274
aVAnd I hope with every ounce of my body that no one heard \u2014
p275
aVnot my sister, not my girlfriend, and certainly not my niece.
p276
aVI am accustomed to this familiar hurt,
p277
aVbut I will do whatever I need to do to protect the people I love from it.
p278
aa(lp279
VBut then I take my niece off my shoulders,
p280
aVand she runs to Elsa and Anna \u2014
p281
aVthe thing she's been waiting so long for \u2014
p282
aVand all that stuff goes away.
p283
aVAll that matters is the smile on her face.
p284
aVAnd as the 30 seconds we waited two and a half hours for comes to a close
p285
aVwe gather up our things, and I lock eyes with the clerk again;
p286
aVand she gives me an apologetic smile and mouths,
p287
aV"I am so sorry!"
p288
aV(Laughter)
p289
aVAnd her humanity, her willingness to admit her mistake disarms me immediately,
p290
aVthen I give her a: "It's okay, it happens. But thanks."
p291
aa(lp292
VAnd I realize in that moment
p293
aVthat I don't have to be
p294
aVeither an aunt or an advocate, I can be both.
p295
aVI can live in duality, and I can hold two things.
p296
aVAnd if I can hold two things in that environment,
p297
aVI can hold so many more things.
p298
aVAs my girlfriend and my niece hold hands and skip out the front of the door,
p299
aVI turn to my sister and say, "Was it worth it?"
p300
aVAnd she said, "Are you kidding me?
p301
aVDid you see the look on her face? This was the greatest day of her life!"
p302
aV(Laughter)
p303
aV"It was worth the two and a half hours in the heat,
p304
aVit was worth the overpriced coloring book that we already had a copy of."
p305
aV(Laughter)
p306
aV"It was even worth you  getting called Dad."
p307
aV(Laughter)
p308
aVAnd for the first time ever in my life, it actually was.
p309
aa(lp310
