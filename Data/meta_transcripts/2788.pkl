VVanessa Garrison: I am Vanessa,
p4
aVdaughter of Annette,
p5
aVdaughter of Olympia,
p6
aVdaughter of Melvina,
p7
aVdaughter of Katie, born 1878,
p8
aVParish County, Louisiana.
p9
aa(lp10
VT. Morgan Dixon: And my name is Morgan,
p11
aVdaughter of Carol, daughter of Letha, daughter of Willie,
p12
aVdaughter of Sarah, born 1849 in Bardstown, Kentucky.
p13
aa(lp14
VVG: And in the tradition of our families,
p15
aVthe great oral tradition of almost every black church we know
p16
aVhonoring the culture from which we draw so much power,
p17
aVwe're gonna start the way our mommas and grandmas would want us to start.
p18
aa(lp19
VTMD: In prayer. Let the words of my mouth,
p20
aVthe meditation of our hearts, be acceptable in thy sight,
p21
aVoh Lord, my strength and my redeemer.
p22
aa(lp23
VVG: We call the names and rituals of our ancestors into this room today
p24
aVbecause from them we received a powerful blueprint for survival,
p25
aVstrategies and tactics for healing carried across oceans by African women,
p26
aVpassed down to generations of black women in America
p27
aVwho used those skills to navigate institutions of slavery
p28
aVand state-sponsored discrimination
p29
aVin order that we might stand on this stage.
p30
aVWe walk in the footsteps of those women,
p31
aVour foremothers, legends
p32
aVlike Ella Baker, Septima Clark, Fannie Lou Hamer,
p33
aVfrom whom we learned the power of organizing
p34
aVafter she would had single-handedly registered
p35
aV60,000 voters in Jim Crow Mississippi.
p36
aa(lp37
VTMD: 60,000 is a lot of people, so if you can imagine
p38
aVme and Vanessa inspiring 60,000 women to walk with us last year,
p39
aVwe were fired up.
p40
aVBut today, 100,000 black women and girls stand on this stage with us.
p41
aVWe are committed to healing ourselves,
p42
aVto lacing up our sneakers, to walking out of our front door
p43
aVevery single day for total healing and transformation in our communities,
p44
aVbecause we understand
p45
aVthat we are in the footsteps of a civil rights legacy
p46
aVlike no other time before,
p47
aVand that we are facing a health crisis like never ever before.
p48
aVAnd so we've had a lot of moments, great moments,
p49
aVincluding the time we had on our pajamas, we were working on our computer
p50
aVand Michelle Obama emailed us and invited us to the White House,
p51
aVand we thought it was spam.
p52
aVBut this moment here is an opportunity.
p53
aVIt is an opportunity that we don't take for granted,
p54
aVand so we thought long and hard about how we would use it.
p55
aVWould we talk to the women we hope to inspire,
p56
aVa million in the next year,
p57
aVor would we talk to you?
p58
aVWe decided to talk to you,
p59
aVand to talk to you about a question that we get all the time,
p60
aVso that the millions of women who hopefully will watch this
p61
aVwill never have to answer it again.
p62
aVIt is: Why are black women dying
p63
aVfaster and at higher rates
p64
aVthan any other group of people in America
p65
aVfrom preventable, obesity-related diseases?
p66
aa(lp67
VThe question hurts me.
p68
aVI'm shaking a little bit.
p69
aVIt feels value-laden.
p70
aVIt hurts my body because the weight represents so much.
p71
aVBut we're going to talk about it
p72
aVand invite you into an inside conversation today
p73
aVbecause it is necessary, and because we need you.
p74
aa(lp75
VVG: Each night, before the first day of school,
p76
aVmy grandmother would sit me next to the stove
p77
aVand with expert precision use a hot comb to press my hair.
p78
aVMy grandmother was legendary, big, loud.
p79
aVShe filled up a room with laughter and oftentimes curse words.
p80
aVShe cooked a mean peach cobbler,
p81
aVhad 11 children, a house full of grandchildren,
p82
aVand like every black woman I know,
p83
aVlike most all women I know,
p84
aVshe had prioritized the care of others over caring for herself.
p85
aVWe measured her strength by her capacity to endure pain and suffering.
p86
aVWe celebrated her for it, and our choice would prove to be deadly.
p87
aVOne night after pressing my hair before the first day of eighth grade,
p88
aVmy grandmother went to bed and never woke up,
p89
aVdead at 66 years old from a heart attack.
p90
aVBy the time I would graduate college,
p91
aVI would lose two more beloved family members to chronic disease:
p92
aVmy aunt Diane, dead at 55, my aunt Tricia, dead at 63.
p93
aVAfter living with these losses, the hole that they left,
p94
aVI decided to calculate the life expectancy of the women in my family.
p95
aVStaring back at me, the number 65.
p96
aVI knew I could not sit by
p97
aVand watch another woman I loved die an early death.
p98
aa(lp99
VTMD: So we don't usually put our business in the streets.
p100
aVLet's just put that out there.
p101
aVBut I have to tell you the statistics.
p102
aVBlack women are dying at alarming rates,
p103
aVand I used to be a classroom teacher,
p104
aVand I was at South Atlanta High School,
p105
aVand I remember standing in front of my classroom,
p106
aVand I remember a statistic that half of black girls will get diabetes
p107
aVunless diet and levels of activity change.
p108
aVHalf of the girls in my classroom. So I couldn't teach anymore.
p109
aVSo I started taking girls hiking, which is why we're called GirlTrek,
p110
aVbut Vanessa was like,
p111
aVthat is not going to move the dial on the health crisis; it's cute.
p112
aVShe was like, it's a cute hiking club.
p113
aVSo what we thought
p114
aVis if we could rally a million of their mothers ...
p115
aV82 percent of black women are over a healthy weight right now.
p116
aV53 percent of us are obese.
p117
aVBut the number that I cannot,
p118
aVthat I cannot get out of my head
p119
aVis that every single day in America,
p120
aV137 black women
p121
aVdie from a preventable disease,
p122
aVheart disease.
p123
aVThat's every 11 minutes.
p124
aV137 is more than gun violence,
p125
aVcigarette smoking and HIV combined,
p126
aVevery day.
p127
aVIt is roughly the amount of people
p128
aVthat were on my plane from New Jersey to Vancouver.
p129
aVCan you imagine that?
p130
aVA plane filled with black women crashing to the ground every day,
p131
aVand no one is talking about it.
p132
aa(lp133
VVG: So the question that you're all asking yourselves right now is why?
p134
aVWhy are black women dying? We asked ourselves that same question.
p135
aVWhy is what's out there not working for them?
p136
aVPrivate weight loss companies, government interventions,
p137
aVpublic health campaigns.
p138
aVI'm going to tell you why:
p139
aVbecause they focus on weight loss
p140
aVor looking good in skinny jeans
p141
aVwithout acknowledging the trauma
p142
aVthat black women hold in our bellies and bones,
p143
aVthat has been embedded in our very DNA.
p144
aVThe best advice from hospitals and doctors,
p145
aVthe best medications from pharmaceutical companies
p146
aVto treat the congestive heart failure of my grandmother didn't work
p147
aVbecause they didn't acknowledge the systemic racism
p148
aVthat she had dealt with since birth.
p149
aa(lp150
V(Applause)
p151
aa(lp152
VA divestment in schools, discriminatory housing practices,
p153
aVpredatory lending, a crack cocaine epidemic,
p154
aVmass incarceration putting more black bodies behind bars
p155
aVthan were owned at the height of slavery.
p156
aa(lp157
VBut GirlTrek does.
p158
aVFor black women whose bodies are buckling under the weight
p159
aVof systems never designed to support them,
p160
aVGirlTrek is a lifeline.
p161
aVAugust 16, 2015, Danita Kimball, a member of GirlTrek in Detroit,
p162
aVreceived the news that too many black mothers have received.
p163
aVHer son Norman, 23 years old, a father of two,
p164
aVwas gunned down while on an afternoon drive.
p165
aVImagine the grief
p166
aVthat overcomes your body in that moment,
p167
aVthe immobilizing fear.
p168
aVNow, know this, that just days after laying her son to rest,
p169
aVDanita Kimball posted online,
p170
aV"I don't know what to do or how to move forward,
p171
aVbut my sisters keep telling me I need to walk, so I will."
p172
aVAnd then just days after that,
p173
aV"I got my steps in today for my baby Norm.
p174
aVIt felt good to be out there, to walk."
p175
aa(lp176
VTMD: Walking through pain is what we have always done.
p177
aVMy mom, she's in the middle right there,
p178
aVmy mom desegregated her high school in 1955.
p179
aVHer mom walked down the steps of an abandoned school bus
p180
aVwhere she raised 11 kids as a sharecropper.
p181
aVAnd her mom stepped onto Indian territory
p182
aVfleeing the terrors of the Jim Crow South.
p183
aVAnd her mom walked her man to the door
p184
aVas he went off to fight in the Kentucky Colored Regiment,
p185
aVthe Civil War.
p186
aVThey were born slaves but they wouldn't die slaves.
p187
aVChange-making, it's in my blood.
p188
aVIt's what I do,
p189
aVand this health crisis ain't nothing compared to the road we have traveled.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Applause)
p192
aa(lp193
VSo it's like James Cleveland.
p194
aVI don't feel no ways tired, so we got to work.
p195
aVWe started looking at models of change.
p196
aVWe looked all over the world.
p197
aVWe needed something
p198
aVnot only that was a part of our cultural inheritance like walking,
p199
aVbut something that was scalable, something that was high-impact,
p200
aVsomething that we could replicate across this country.
p201
aVSo we studied models like Wangari Maathai, who won the Nobel Peace Prize
p202
aVfor inspiring women to plant 50 million trees in Kenya.
p203
aVShe brought Kenya back from the brink of environmental devastation.
p204
aVWe studied these systems of change, and we looked at walking scientifically.
p205
aVAnd what we learned is that walking just 30 minutes a day
p206
aVcan single-handedly decrease 50 percent of your risk of diabetes,
p207
aVheart disease, stroke, even Alzheimer's and dementia.
p208
aVWe know that walking is the single most powerful thing
p209
aVthat a woman can do for her health,
p210
aVso we knew we were on to something,
p211
aVbecause from Harriet Tubman to the women in Montgomery,
p212
aVwhen black women walk, things change.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Applause)
p215
aa(lp216
VVG: So how did we take this simple idea of walking
p217
aVand start a revolution that would catch a fire
p218
aVin neighborhoods across America?
p219
aVWe used the best practices of the Civil Rights Movement.
p220
aVWe huddled up in church basements.
p221
aVWe did grapevine information sharing through beauty salons.
p222
aVWe empowered and trained mothers to stand on the front lines.
p223
aVWe took our message directly to the streets,
p224
aVand women responded.
p225
aVWomen like LaKeisha in Chattanooga,
p226
aVChrysantha in Detroit,
p227
aVOnika in New Orleans,
p228
aVwomen with difficult names and difficult stories
p229
aVjoin GirlTrek every day and commit to walking as a practice of self-care.
p230
aVOnce walking, those women get to organizing,
p231
aVfirst their families, then their communities,
p232
aVto walk and talk and solve problems together.
p233
aVThey walk and notice the abandoned building.
p234
aVThey walk and notice the lack of sidewalks,
p235
aVthe lack of green space,
p236
aVand they say, "No more."
p237
aVWomen like Susie Paige in Philadelphia,
p238
aVwho after walking daily past an abandoned building in her neighborhood,
p239
aVdecided, "I'm not waiting.
p240
aVLet me rally my team. Let me grab some supplies.
p241
aVLet me do what no one else has done for me and my community."
p242
aa(lp243
VTMD: We know one woman can make a difference,
p244
aVbecause one woman has already changed the world,
p245
aVand her name is Harriet Tubman.
p246
aVAnd trust me, I love Harriet Tubman.
p247
aVI'm obsessed with her, and I used to be a history teacher.
p248
aVI will not tell you the whole history.
p249
aVI will tell you four things.
p250
aVSo I used to have an old Saab \u2014
p251
aVthe kind of canvas top that drips on your head when it rains \u2014
p252
aVand I drove all the way down to the eastern shore of Maryland,
p253
aVand when I stepped on the dirt
p254
aVthat Harriet Tubman made her first escape,
p255
aVI knew she was a woman just like we are
p256
aVand that we could do what she had done,
p257
aVand we learned four things from Harriet Tubman.
p258
aa(lp259
VThe first one: do not wait.
p260
aVWalk right now in the direction of your healthiest, most fulfilled life,
p261
aVbecause self-care is a revolutionary act.
p262
aa(lp263
VNumber two:
p264
aVwhen you learn the way forward, come back and get a sister.
p265
aVSo in our case, start a team with your friends \u2014
p266
aVyour friends, your family, your church.
p267
aa(lp268
VNumber three:
p269
aVrally your allies.
p270
aVEvery single person in this room
p271
aVis complicit in a Tubman-inspired takeover.
p272
aa(lp273
VAnd number four:
p274
aVfind joy.
p275
aVThe most underreported fact of Harriet Tubman
p276
aVis that she lived to be 93 years old,
p277
aVand she didn't live just an ordinary life; uh-uh.
p278
aVShe was standing up for the good guys. She married a younger man.
p279
aVShe adopted a child. I'm not kidding. She lived.
p280
aVAnd I drove up to her house of freedom in upstate New York,
p281
aVand she had planted apple trees,
p282
aVand when I was there on a Sunday, they were blooming.
p283
aVDo you call it \u2014 do they bloom?
p284
aVThe apples were in season,
p285
aVand I was thinking, she left fruit for us,
p286
aVthe legacy of Harriet Tubman, every single year.
p287
aVAnd we know that we are Harriet,
p288
aVand we know that there is a Harriet in every community in America.
p289
aa(lp290
VVG: We also know that there's a Harriet in every community across the globe,
p291
aVand that they could learn from our Tubman Doctrine,
p292
aVas we call it, the four steps.
p293
aVImagine the possibilities
p294
aVbeyond the neighborhoods of Oakland and Newark,
p295
aVto the women working rice fields in Vietnam,
p296
aVtea fields in Sri Lanka,
p297
aVthe women on the mountainsides in Guatemala,
p298
aVthe indigenous reservations throughout the vast plains of the Dakotas.
p299
aVWe believe that women walking
p300
aVand talking together to solve their problems
p301
aVis a global solution.
p302
aa(lp303
VTMD: And I'll leave you with this,
p304
aVbecause we also believe it can become the center of social justice again.
p305
aVVanessa and I were in Fort Lauderdale.
p306
aVWe had an organizer training,
p307
aVand I was leaving and I got on the airplane,
p308
aVand I saw someone I knew, so I waved,
p309
aVand as I'm waiting in that long line that you guys know,
p310
aVwaiting for people to put their stuff away,
p311
aVI looked back and I realized I didn't know the woman but I recognized her.
p312
aVAnd so I blew her a kiss because it was Sybrina Fulton,
p313
aVTrayvon Martin's mom,
p314
aVand she whispered "thank you" back to me.
p315
aVAnd I can't help but wonder what would happen
p316
aVif there were groups of women walking on Trayvon's block that day,
p317
aVor what would happen in the South Side of Chicago every day
p318
aVif there were groups of women and mothers and aunts and cousins
p319
aVwalking,
p320
aVor along the polluted rivers of Flint, Michigan.
p321
aVI believe that walking can transform our communities,
p322
aVbecause it's already starting to.
p323
aa(lp324
VVG: We believe that the personal is political.
p325
aVOur walking is for healing, for joy, for fresh air,
p326
aVquiet time, to connect and disconnect, to worship.
p327
aVBut it's also walking so we can be healthy enough
p328
aVto stand on the front lines for change in our communities,
p329
aVand it is our call to action to every black woman listening,
p330
aVevery black woman in earshot of our voice,
p331
aVevery black woman who you know.
p332
aVThink about it: the woman working front desk reception at your job,
p333
aVthe woman who delivers your mail, your neighbor \u2014
p334
aVour call to action to them, to join us on the front lines
p335
aVfor change in your community.
p336
aa(lp337
VTMD: And I'll bring us back to this moment
p338
aVand why it's so important for my dear, dear friend Vanessa and I.
p339
aVIt's because it's not always easy for us,
p340
aVand in fact, we have both seen really, really dark days,
p341
aVfrom the hate speech to the summer of police brutality and violence
p342
aVthat we saw last year,
p343
aVto even losing one of our walkers,
p344
aVSandy Bland, who died in police custody.
p345
aVBut the most courageous thing we do every day is we practice faith
p346
aVthat goes beyond the facts,
p347
aVand we put feet to our prayers every single day,
p348
aVand when we get overwhelmed,
p349
aVwe think of the words of people like Sonia Sanchez, a poet laureate,
p350
aVwho says, "Morgan, where is your fire?
p351
aVWhere is the fire that burned holes through slave ships
p352
aVto make us breathe?
p353
aVWhere is the fire that turned guts into chitlins,
p354
aVthat took rhythms and make jazz,
p355
aVthat took sit-ins and marches and made us jump boundaries and barriers?
p356
aVYou've got to find it and pass it on."
p357
aa(lp358
VSo this is us finding our fire and passing it on to you.
p359
aVSo please, stand with us,
p360
aVwalk with us as we rally a million women
p361
aVto reclaim the streets of the 50 highest need communities
p362
aVin this country.
p363
aa(lp364
VWe thank you so much for this opportunity.
