VHi there.
p4
aVI'm going to be talking a little bit about
p5
aVmusic, machines and life.
p6
aVOr, more specifically,
p7
aVwhat we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine
p8
aVfor a music video.
p9
aVSome of you may recognize this image.
p10
aVThis is the opening frame of the video that we created.
p11
aVWe'll be showing the video at the end,
p12
aVbut before we do, I want to talk a little bit about
p13
aVwhat it is that they wanted.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, when we first started talking to OK Go \u2014
p16
aVthe name of the song is "This Too Shall Pass" \u2014
p17
aVwe were really excited because
p18
aVthey expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with.
p19
aVAnd we were very excited about this
p20
aVbecause, of course,
p21
aVthey have a history of dancing with machines.
p22
aVThey're responsible for this video, "Here It Goes Again."
p23
aV50-million-plus views on YouTube.
p24
aVFour guys dancing on treadmills,
p25
aVno cuts, just a static camera.
p26
aVA fantastically viral and wonderful video.
p27
aVSo we were really excited about working with them.
p28
aVAnd we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted.
p29
aVAnd they explained that they wanted
p30
aVkind of a Rube Goldberg machine.
p31
aa(lp32
VNow, for those of you who don't know,
p33
aVa Rube Goldberg machine
p34
aVis a complicated contraption,
p35
aVan incredibly over-engineered piece of machinery
p36
aVthat accomplishes a relatively simple task.
p37
aVSo we were excited by this idea,
p38
aVand we started talking about
p39
aVexactly what it would look like.
p40
aVAnd we came up with some parameters, because,
p41
aVyou know, building a Rube Goldberg machine
p42
aVhas limitations,
p43
aVbut it also is pretty wide open.
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd we wanted to make sure that we did something
p46
aVthat would work for a music video.
p47
aVSo we came up with a list of requirements,
p48
aVthe "10 commandments,"
p49
aVand they were, in order of ascending difficulty:
p50
aVThe first is "No magic."
p51
aVEverything that happened on screen had to be
p52
aVvery easily understood by a typical viewer.
p53
aVThe rule of thumb was that, if my mother couldn't understand it,
p54
aVthen we couldn't use it in the video.
p55
aVThey wanted band integration,
p56
aVthat is, the machine acting upon the band members,
p57
aVspecifically not the other way around.
p58
aVThey wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling.
p59
aVSo as the song picks up emotion,
p60
aVso should the machine
p61
aVget grander in its process.
p62
aVThey wanted us to make use of the space.
p63
aVSo we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using,
p64
aVdivided between two floors.
p65
aVIt included an exterior loading dock.
p66
aVWe used all of that, including a giant hole in the floor
p67
aVthat we actually descended the camera and cameraman through.
p68
aVThey wanted it messy, and we were happy to oblige.
p69
aVThe machine itself would start the music.
p70
aVSo the machine would get started,
p71
aVit would travel some distance,
p72
aVreacting along the way,
p73
aVhit play on an iPod or a tape deck
p74
aVor something that would start playback.
p75
aVAnd the machine would maintain synchronization throughout.
p76
aVAnd speaking of synchronization,
p77
aVthey wanted it to sync to the rhythm
p78
aVand to hit specific beats along the way.
p79
aVOkay. (Laughter)
p80
aVThey wanted it to end precisely on time.
p81
aVOkay, so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect.
p82
aVAnd they wanted the music to drop out
p83
aVat a certain point in the video
p84
aVand actual live audio from the machine
p85
aVto play part of the song.
p86
aVAnd as if that wasn't enough,
p87
aVall of these incredibly complicating things, right,
p88
aVthey wanted it in one shot.
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
V(Applause)
p93
aa(lp94
VOkay.
p95
aVSo, just some statistics
p96
aVabout what we went through in the process.
p97
aVThe machine itself has
p98
aV89 distinct interactions.
p99
aVIt took us 85 takes
p100
aVto get it on film
p101
aVto our satisfaction.
p102
aVOf those 85 takes,
p103
aVonly three actually successfully completed their run.
p104
aVWe destroyed two pianos
p105
aVand 10 televisions in the process.
p106
aVWe went to Home Depot well over a hundred times.
p107
aV(Laughter)
p108
aVAnd we lost one high-heeled shoe
p109
aVwhen one of our engineers, Heather Knight,
p110
aVleft her high-heeled shoe \u2014 after a nice dinner,
p111
aVand returned back to the build \u2014
p112
aVand left it in a pile of stuff.
p113
aVAnd another engineer thought, "Well, that would be a really good thing to use"
p114
aVand ended up using it as a really nice trigger.
p115
aVAnd it's actually in the machine.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo what did we learn from all of this?
p118
aVWell, having completed this,
p119
aVwe have the opportunity to step back and reflect
p120
aVon some of the things.
p121
aVAnd we learned that small stuff stinks.
p122
aVLittle balls in wooden tracks
p123
aVare really susceptible to
p124
aVhumidity and temperature and a little bit of dust,
p125
aVand they fall out of the tracks,
p126
aVthe exact angles makes it hard to get right.
p127
aVAnd yet, a bowling ball will always follow the same path.
p128
aVIt doesn't matter what temperature it is,
p129
aVdoesn't matter what's in its way;
p130
aVit will pretty much get where it needs to go.
p131
aVBut as much as the small stuff stinks, we needed somewhere to start,
p132
aVso that we would have somewhere to go.
p133
aVAnd so you have to start with it. You have to focus on it.
p134
aVSmall stuff stinks,
p135
aVbut, of course, it's essential, right?
p136
aa(lp137
VWhat else? Planning is incredibly important.
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aVYou know, we spent a lot of time ideating
p140
aVand even building some of these things.
p141
aVIt's been said that, "No battle plan
p142
aVsurvives contact with the enemy."
p143
aVI think our enemy was physics \u2014
p144
aV(Laughter)
p145
aVand she's a cruel mistress.
p146
aVOften, we had to pull things out as a result
p147
aVbecause of timing or aesthetics or whatever.
p148
aVAnd so while planning is important, so is flexibility.
p149
aVThese are all things that ended up
p150
aVnot making it into the final machine.
p151
aVSo also, put reliable stuff last,
p152
aVthe stuff that's going to run every time.
p153
aVAgain, small to large is relevant here.
p154
aVThe little Lego car in the beginning of the video
p155
aVreferences the big, real car
p156
aVnear the end of the video.
p157
aVThe big, real car works every time; there's no problem about it.
p158
aVThe little one had a tendency to try to run off the track
p159
aVand that's a problem.
p160
aVBut you don't want to have to reset the whole machine
p161
aVbecause the Lego car at the end doesn't work, right.
p162
aVSo you put that up front so that, if it fails,
p163
aVat least you know
p164
aVyou don't have to reset the whole thing.
p165
aa(lp166
VLife can be
p167
aVmessy.
p168
aVThere were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing.
p169
aVMonths were spent in this tiny, cold warehouse.
p170
aVAnd the wonderful elation that we had
p171
aVwhen we finally completed it.
p172
aVSo it's important to remember that whether it's good or it's bad,
p173
aV"This Too Shall Pass."
p174
aa(lp175
VThank you very much.
p176
aa(lp177
V(Applause)
p178
aVAnd now to introduce
p179
aa(lp180
Vtheir music video,
p181
aVwe have OK Go.
p182
aa(lp183
VOK Go: An introduction. Hello TEDxUSC.
p184
aVWe are OK Go.
p185
aVWhat are we doing? Oh, just hanging out with our Grammy. What what!
p186
aVIt think we can do better than this. Hello TEDxUSC.
p187
aVWe are OK Go. Have you read the "Natural Curiosity Cabinet?"
p188
aVI mean, "Curiosity" \u2014 excuse me.
p189
aVLet me start again.
p190
aVWe need some more ridiculous things besides "The Cabinet of Natural Curiosities."
p191
aVTim's sundial hat.
p192
aVHave you seen the new work they've done to the Waltz Towers?
p193
aVSorry, start again.
p194
aV(Barking)
p195
aVDogs.
p196
aVHello, TEDxUSC. We are OK Go,
p197
aVand this our new video, "This Too Shall Pass."
p198
aV[unclear]
p199
aVKay, we can still do one better I think, yeah.
p200
aVThat one's pretty good. It's getting better.
