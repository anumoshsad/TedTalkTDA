VIf you want to buy high-quality, low-price cocaine,
p4
aVthere really is only one place to go,
p5
aVand that is the dark net anonymous markets.
p6
aa(lp7
VNow, you can't get to these sites
p8
aVwith a normal browser \u2014 Chrome or Firefox \u2014
p9
aVbecause they're on this hidden part of the Internet,
p10
aVknown as Tor hidden services,
p11
aVwhere URLs are a string of meaningless numbers and letters that end in .onion,
p12
aVand which you access with a special browser
p13
aVcalled the Tor browser.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow, the Tor browser was originally a U.S. Naval intelligence project.
p16
aVIt then became open source,
p17
aVand it allows anybody to browse the net
p18
aVwithout giving away their location.
p19
aVAnd it does this by encrypting your IP address
p20
aVand then routing it via several other computers around the world
p21
aVthat use the same software.
p22
aVYou can use it on the normal Internet,
p23
aVbut it's also your key to the dark net.
p24
aVAnd because of this fiendishly clever encryption system,
p25
aVthe 20 or 30 \u2014 we don't know exactly \u2014 thousand sites that operate there
p26
aVare incredibly difficult to shut down.
p27
aVIt is a censorship-free world visited by anonymous users.
p28
aa(lp29
VLittle wonder, then, that it's a natural place to go
p30
aVfor anybody with something to hide,
p31
aVand that something, of course, need not be illegal.
p32
aVOn the dark net, you will find
p33
aVwhistle-blower sites, The New Yorker.
p34
aVYou will find political activism blogs.
p35
aVYou will find libraries of pirated books.
p36
aVBut you'll also find the drugs markets,
p37
aVillegal pornography, commercial hacking services,
p38
aVand much more besides.
p39
aVNow, the dark net is one of the most interesting, exciting places
p40
aVanywhere on the net.
p41
aVAnd the reason is, because although innovation, of course,
p42
aVtakes place in big businesses,
p43
aVtakes place in world-class universities,
p44
aVit also takes place in the fringes,
p45
aVbecause those on the fringes \u2014 the pariahs, the outcasts \u2014
p46
aVthey're often the most creative, because they have to be.
p47
aVIn this part of the Internet,
p48
aVyou will not find a single lolcat,
p49
aVa single pop-up advert anywhere.
p50
aVAnd that's one of the reasons why I think
p51
aVmany of you here will be on the dark net fairly soon.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
VNot that I'm suggesting anyone in this audience would use it
p56
aVto go and procure high-quality narcotics.
p57
aVBut let's say for a moment that you were.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VBear with me.
p62
aVThe first thing you will notice on signing up to one of these sites
p63
aVis how familiar it looks.
p64
aVEvery single product \u2014
p65
aVthousands of products \u2014
p66
aVhas a glossy, high-res image,
p67
aVa detailed product description, a price.
p68
aVThere's a "Proceed to checkout" icon.
p69
aVThere is even, most beautifully of all,
p70
aVa "Report this item" button.
p71
aa(lp72
V(Laughter)
p73
aa(lp74
VIncredible.
p75
aa(lp76
VYou browse through the site, you make your choice,
p77
aVyou pay with the crypto-currency bitcoin,
p78
aVyou enter an address \u2014  preferably not your home address \u2014
p79
aVand you wait for your product to arrive in the post,
p80
aVwhich it nearly always does.
p81
aVAnd the reason it does is not because of the clever encryption.
p82
aVThat's important.
p83
aVSomething far simpler than that.
p84
aVIt's the user reviews.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Laughter)
p87
aa(lp88
VYou see, every single vendor on these sites
p89
aVuses a pseudonym, naturally enough,
p90
aVbut they keep the same pseudonym to build up a reputation.
p91
aVAnd because it's easy for the buyer to change allegiance whenever they want,
p92
aVthe only way of trusting a vendor
p93
aVis if they have a good history of positive feedback
p94
aVfrom other users of the site.
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd this introduction of competition and choice
p97
aVdoes exactly what the economists would predict.
p98
aVPrices tend to go down, product quality tends to go up,
p99
aVand the vendors are attentive,
p100
aVthey're polite, they're consumer-centric,
p101
aVoffering you all manner of special deals, one-offs,
p102
aVbuy-one-get-one-frees, free delivery,
p103
aVto keep you happy.
p104
aa(lp105
VI spoke to Drugsheaven.
p106
aVDrugsheaven was offering excellent and consistent marijuana
p107
aVat a reasonable price.
p108
aVHe had a very generous refund policy,
p109
aVdetailed T's and C's,
p110
aVand good shipping times.
p111
aa(lp112
V"Dear Drugsheaven," I wrote,
p113
aVvia the internal emailing system that's also encrypted, of course.
p114
aV"I'm new here. Do you mind if I buy just one gram of marijuana?"
p115
aa(lp116
VA couple of hours later, I get a reply.
p117
aVThey always reply.
p118
aa(lp119
V"Hi there, thanks for your email.
p120
aVStarting small is a wise thing to do. I would, too, if I were you."
p121
aa(lp122
V(Laughter)
p123
aa(lp124
V"So no problem if you'd like to start with just one gram.
p125
aVI do hope we can do business together.
p126
aVBest wishes, Drugsheaven."
p127
aa(lp128
V(Laughter)
p129
aa(lp130
VI don't know why he had a posh English accent, but I assume he did.
p131
aa(lp132
VNow, this kind of consumer-centric attitude
p133
aVis the reason why, when I reviewed 120,000 pieces of feedback
p134
aVthat had been left on one of these sites over a three-month period,
p135
aV95 percent of them were five out of five.
p136
aVThe customer, you see, is king.
p137
aVBut what does that mean?
p138
aVWell, on the one hand,
p139
aVthat means there are more drugs, more available, more easily,
p140
aVto more people.
p141
aVAnd by my reckoning, that is not a good thing.
p142
aVBut, on the other hand, if you are going to take drugs,
p143
aVyou have a reasonably good way
p144
aVof guaranteeing a certain level of purity and quality,
p145
aVwhich is incredibly important if you're taking drugs.
p146
aVAnd you can do so from the comfort of your own home,
p147
aVwithout the risks associated with buying on the streets.
p148
aa(lp149
VNow, as I said,
p150
aVyou've got to be creative and innovative to survive in this marketplace.
p151
aVAnd the 20 or so sites that are currently in operation \u2014
p152
aVby the way, they don't always work, they're not always perfect;
p153
aVthe site that I showed you was shut down 18 months ago,
p154
aVbut not before it had turned over a billion dollars' worth of trade.
p155
aVBut these markets,
p156
aVbecause of the difficult conditions in which they are operating,
p157
aVthe inhospitable conditions,
p158
aVare always innovating, always thinking of ways of getting smarter,
p159
aVmore decentralized, harder to censor,
p160
aVand more customer-friendly.
p161
aa(lp162
VLet's take the payment system.
p163
aVYou don't pay with your credit card,
p164
aVof course \u2014 that would lead directly back to you.
p165
aVSo you use the crypto-currency bitcoin,
p166
aVwhich is easily exchanged for real-world currencies
p167
aVand gives quite a high degree of anonymity to its users.
p168
aa(lp169
VBut at the beginning of these sites, people noticed a flaw.
p170
aVSome of the unscrupulous dealers were running away with peoples' bitcoin
p171
aVbefore they'd mailed the drugs out.
p172
aVThe community came up with a solution, called multi-signature escrow payments.
p173
aVSo on purchasing my item,
p174
aVI would send my bitcoin
p175
aVto a neutral, secure third digital wallet.
p176
aVThe vendor, who would see that I'd sent it,
p177
aVwould be confident that they could then send the product to me,
p178
aVand then when I received it,
p179
aVat least two of the three people engaged in the transaction \u2014
p180
aVvendor, buyer, site administrator \u2014
p181
aVwould have to sign the transaction off
p182
aVwith a unique digital signature,
p183
aVand then the money would be transferred.
p184
aa(lp185
VBrilliant!
p186
aVElegant.
p187
aVIt works.
p188
aa(lp189
VBut then they realized there was a problem with bitcoin,
p190
aVbecause every bitcoin transaction
p191
aVis actually recorded publicly in a public ledger.
p192
aVSo if you're clever, you can try and work out who's behind them.
p193
aVSo they came up with a tumbling service.
p194
aVHundreds of people send their bitcoin into one address,
p195
aVthey're tumbled and jumbled up,
p196
aVand then the right amount is sent on to the right recipients,
p197
aVbut they're different bitcoins:
p198
aVmicro-laundering systems.
p199
aa(lp200
V(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VIt's incredible.
p203
aa(lp204
VInterested in what drugs are trending right now on the dark net markets?
p205
aVCheck Grams, the search engine.
p206
aVYou can even buy some advertising space.
p207
aa(lp208
V(Laughter)
p209
aa(lp210
VAre you an ethical consumer worried about what the drugs industry is doing?
p211
aVYeah.
p212
aVOne vendor will offer you fair trade organic cocaine.
p213
aa(lp214
V(Laughter)
p215
aa(lp216
VThat's not being sourced from Colombian druglords,
p217
aVbut Guatemalan farmers.
p218
aVThey even promised to reinvest 20 percent of any profits
p219
aVinto local education programs.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VThere's even a mystery shopper.
p224
aa(lp225
VNow, whatever you think about the morality of these sites \u2014
p226
aVand I submit that it's not actually an easy question \u2014
p227
aVthe creation of functioning, competitive, anonymous markets,
p228
aVwhere nobody knows who anybody else is,
p229
aVconstantly at risk of being shut down by the authorities,
p230
aVis a staggering achievement,
p231
aVa phenomenal achievement.
p232
aVAnd it's that kind of innovation
p233
aVthat's why those on the fringes
p234
aVare often the harbingers of what is to come.
p235
aa(lp236
VIt's easy to forget
p237
aVthat because of its short life,
p238
aVthe Internet has actually changed many times
p239
aVover the last 30 years or so.
p240
aVIt started in the '70s as a military project,
p241
aVmorphed in the 1980s to an academic network,
p242
aVco-opted by commercial companies in the '90s,
p243
aVand then invaded by all of us via social media in the noughties,
p244
aVbut I think it's going to change again.
p245
aVAnd I think things like the dark net markets \u2014
p246
aVcreative, secure, difficult to censor \u2014
p247
aVI think that's the future.
p248
aa(lp249
VAnd the reason it's the future
p250
aVis because we're all worried about our privacy.
p251
aVSurveys consistently show concerns about privacy.
p252
aVThe more time we spend online, the more we worry about them,
p253
aVand those surveys show our worries are growing.
p254
aVWe're worried about what happens to our data.
p255
aVWe're worried about who might be watching us.
p256
aa(lp257
VSince the revelations from Edward Snowden,
p258
aVthere's been a huge increase in the number of people
p259
aVusing various privacy-enhancing tools.
p260
aVThere are now between two and three million daily users
p261
aVof the Tor browser,
p262
aVthe majority of which use is perfectly legitimate,
p263
aVsometimes even mundane.
p264
aVAnd there are hundreds of activists around the world
p265
aVworking on techniques and tools to keep you private online \u2014
p266
aVdefault encrypted messaging services.
p267
aVEthereum, which is a project which tries to link up
p268
aVthe connected but unused hard drives of millions of computers around the world,
p269
aVto create a sort of distributed Internet that no one really controls.
p270
aVNow, we've had distributed computing before, of course.
p271
aVWe use it for everything from Skype to the search for extraterrestrial life.
p272
aVBut you add distributed computing and powerful encryption \u2014
p273
aVthat's very, very hard to censor and control.
p274
aVAnother called MaidSafe works on similar principles.
p275
aVAnother called Twister, and so on and so on.
p276
aa(lp277
VAnd here's the thing \u2014
p278
aVthe more of us join,
p279
aVthe more interesting those sites become,
p280
aVand then the more of us join, and so on.
p281
aVAnd I think that's what's going to happen.
p282
aa(lp283
VIn fact, it's already happening.
p284
aVThe dark net is no longer a den for dealers
p285
aVand a hideout for whistle-blowers.
p286
aVIt's already going mainstream.
p287
aVJust recently, the musician Aphex Twin released his album as a dark net site.
p288
aVFacebook has started a dark net site.
p289
aVA group of London architects have opened a dark net site
p290
aVfor people worried about regeneration projects.
p291
aVYes, the dark net is going mainstream,
p292
aVand I predict that fairly soon, every social media company,
p293
aVevery major news outlet,
p294
aVand therefore most of you in this audience,
p295
aVwill be using the dark net, too.
p296
aa(lp297
VSo the Internet is about to get more interesting,
p298
aVmore exciting, more innovative,
p299
aVmore terrible,
p300
aVmore destructive.
p301
aVThat's good news if you care about liberty.
p302
aVIt's good news if you care about freedom.
p303
aVIt's good news if you care about democracy.
p304
aVIt's also good news
p305
aVif you want to browse for illegal pornography
p306
aVand if you want to buy and sell drugs
p307
aVwith impunity.
p308
aVNeither entirely dark, nor entirely light.
p309
aVIt's not one side or the other that's going to win out, but both.
p310
aa(lp311
VThank you very much, indeed.
