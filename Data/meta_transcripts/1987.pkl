VThere are 39 million people in the world
p4
aVwho are blind.
p5
aVEighty percent of them
p6
aVare living in low-income countries such as Kenya,
p7
aVand the absolute majority
p8
aVdo not need to be blind.
p9
aVThey are blind from diseases
p10
aVthat are either completely curable or preventable.
p11
aa(lp12
VKnowing this, with my young family,
p13
aVwe moved to Kenya.
p14
aVWe secured equipment,
p15
aVfunds, vehicles, we trained a team,
p16
aVwe set up a hundred clinics throughout
p17
aVthe Great Rift Valley
p18
aVto try and understand a single question:
p19
aVwhy are people going blind,
p20
aVand what can we do?
p21
aa(lp22
VThe challenges were great.
p23
aVWhen we got to where we were going,
p24
aVwe set up our high-tech equipment.
p25
aVPower was rarely available.
p26
aVWe'd have to run our equipment
p27
aVfrom petrol power generators.
p28
aVAnd then something occurred to me:
p29
aVThere has to be an easier way,
p30
aVbecause it's the patients who are the most in need
p31
aVof access to eye care
p32
aVwho are the least likely to get it.
p33
aa(lp34
VMore people in Kenya,
p35
aVand in sub-Saharan Africa,
p36
aVhave access to a mobile phone
p37
aVthan they do clean running water.
p38
aVSo we said, could we harness
p39
aVthe power of mobile technology
p40
aVto deliver eye care in a new way?
p41
aVAnd so we developed Peek,
p42
aVa smartphone [system] that enables
p43
aVcommunity healthcare workers
p44
aVand empowers them to deliver eye care everywhere.
p45
aVWe set about replacing traditional hospital equipment,
p46
aVwhich is bulky, expensive and fragile,
p47
aVwith smartphone apps and hardware
p48
aVthat make it possible to test anyone
p49
aVin any language and of any age.
p50
aVHere we have a demonstration
p51
aVof a three-month-old having their vision
p52
aVaccurately tested using an app and an eye tracker.
p53
aa(lp54
VWe've got many trials going on
p55
aVin the community and in schools,
p56
aVand through the lessons that we've learned in the field,
p57
aVwe've realized it's extremely important
p58
aVto share the data in non-medical jargon
p59
aVso that people understand
p60
aVwhat we're examining and what that means to them.
p61
aVSo here, for example,
p62
aVwe use our sight sim application,
p63
aVonce your vision has been measured,
p64
aVto show carers and teachers
p65
aVwhat the visual world is like for that person,
p66
aVso they can empathize with them and help them.
p67
aa(lp68
VOnce we've discovered somebody has low vision,
p69
aVthe next big challenge is to work out why,
p70
aVand to be able to do that,
p71
aVwe need to have access to the inside of the eye.
p72
aVTraditionally, this requires expensive equipment
p73
aVto examine an area called the retina.
p74
aVThe retina is the single part of the eye that has
p75
aVhuge amounts of information about the body
p76
aVand its health.
p77
aVWe've developed 3D-printed,
p78
aVlow-cost hardware
p79
aVthat comes in at less than five dollars to produce,
p80
aVwhich can then be clipped onto a smartphone
p81
aVand makes it possible to get views
p82
aVof the back of the eye
p83
aVof a very high quality.
p84
aVAnd the beauty is, anybody can do it.
p85
aVIn our trials on over two and half thousand people,
p86
aVthe smartphone with the add-on clip
p87
aVis comparable to a camera
p88
aVthat is hugely more expensive
p89
aVand hugely more difficult to transport.
p90
aa(lp91
VWhen we first moved to Kenya,
p92
aVwe went with 150,000 dollars of equipment,
p93
aVa team of 15 people,
p94
aVand that was what was needed to deliver health care.
p95
aVNow, all that's needed
p96
aVis a single person
p97
aVon a bike with a smartphone.
p98
aVAnd it costs just 500 dollars.
p99
aVThe issue of power supply
p100
aVis overcome by harnessing the power of solar.
p101
aVOur healthcare workers travel
p102
aVwith a solar-powered rucksack
p103
aVwhich keeps the phone charged and backed up.
p104
aVNow we go to the patient
p105
aVrather than waiting for the patient never to come.
p106
aVWe go to them in their homes
p107
aVand we give them the most comprehensive,
p108
aVhigh-tech, accurate examination,
p109
aVwhich can be delivered by anyone with minimal training.
p110
aVWe can link global experts
p111
aVwith people in the most rural,
p112
aVdifficult-to-reach places
p113
aVthat are beyond the end of the road,
p114
aVeffectively putting those experts in their homes,
p115
aVallowing us to make diagnoses
p116
aVand make plans for treatment.
p117
aa(lp118
VProject managers, hospital directors,
p119
aVare able to search on our interface
p120
aVby any parameter they may be interested in.
p121
aVHere in Nakuru, where I've been living,
p122
aVwe can search for people
p123
aVby whatever condition.
p124
aVHere are people who are blind
p125
aVfrom a curable condition cataract.
p126
aVEach red pin depicts somebody
p127
aVwho is blind from a disease that is curable
p128
aVand treatable, and they're locatable.
p129
aVWe can use bulk text messaging services
p130
aVto explain that we're coming to arrange a treatment.
p131
aa(lp132
VWhat's more, we've learned that this is something
p133
aVthat we haven't built just for the community
p134
aVbut with the community.
p135
aVThose blue pins that drop represent
p136
aVelders, or local leaders,
p137
aVthat are connected to those people
p138
aVwho can ensure that we can find them
p139
aVand arrange treatment.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo for patients like Mama Wangari,
p142
aVwho have been blind for over 10 years
p143
aVand never seen her grandchildren,
p144
aVfor less than 40 dollars, we can restore her eyesight.
p145
aVThis is something that has to happen.
p146
aVIt's only in statistics
p147
aVthat people go blind by the millions.
p148
aVThe reality is everyone goes blind on their own.
p149
aVBut now, they might just be
p150
aVa text message away from help.
p151
aa(lp152
V(Applause)
p153
aa(lp154
VAnd now because live demos are always a bad idea,
p155
aVwe're going to try a live demo.
p156
aa(lp157
V(Laughter)
p158
aa(lp159
VSo here we have the Peek Vision app.
p160
aVOkay, and what we're looking at here,
p161
aVthis is Sam's optic nerve,
p162
aVwhich is a direct extension of her brain,
p163
aVso I'm actually looking at her brain as we look there.
p164
aVWe can see all parts of the retina.
p165
aVIt makes it possible to pick up diseases
p166
aVof the eye and of the body
p167
aVthat would not be possible without access to the eye,
p168
aVand that clip-on device can be manufactured
p169
aVfor just a few dollars,
p170
aVand people can be cured of blindness,
p171
aVand I think it says a lot about us as a human race
p172
aVif we've developed cures and we don't deliver them.
p173
aVBut now we can.
p174
aa(lp175
