VWell when I was asked to do this TEDTalk, I was really chuckled,
p4
aVbecause, you see, my father's name was Ted,
p5
aVand much of my life, especially my musical life,
p6
aVis really a talk that I'm still having with him,
p7
aVor the part of me that he continues to be.
p8
aa(lp9
VNow Ted was a New Yorker, an all-around theater guy,
p10
aVand he was a self-taught illustrator and musician.
p11
aVHe didn't read a note,
p12
aVand he was profoundly hearing impaired.
p13
aVYet, he was my greatest teacher.
p14
aVBecause even through the squeaks of his hearing aids,
p15
aVhis understanding of music was profound.
p16
aa(lp17
VAnd for him, it wasn't so much the way the music goes
p18
aVas about what it witnesses and where it can take you.
p19
aVAnd he did a painting of this experience,
p20
aVwhich he called "In the Realm of Music."
p21
aVNow Ted entered this realm every day by improvising
p22
aVin a sort of Tin Pan Alley style like this.
p23
aV(Music)
p24
aa(lp25
VBut he was tough when it came to music.
p26
aVHe said, "There are only two things that matter in music:
p27
aVwhat and how.
p28
aVAnd the thing about classical music,
p29
aVthat what and how, it's inexhaustible."
p30
aa(lp31
VThat was his passion for the music.
p32
aVBoth my parents really loved it.
p33
aVThey didn't know all that much about it,
p34
aVbut they gave me the opportunity to discover it
p35
aVtogether with them.
p36
aVAnd I think inspired by that memory,
p37
aVit's been my desire to try and bring it
p38
aVto as many other people as I can,
p39
aVsort of pass it on through whatever means.
p40
aVAnd how people get this music, how it comes into their lives,
p41
aVreally fascinates me.
p42
aa(lp43
VOne day in New York, I was on the street
p44
aVand I saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants.
p45
aVAnd a tough, slouchy kid got up to bat,
p46
aVand he took a swing and really connected.
p47
aVAnd he watched the ball fly for a second,
p48
aVand then he went, "Dah dadaratatatah.
p49
aVBrah dada dadadadah."
p50
aVAnd he ran around the bases.
p51
aVAnd I thought, go figure.
p52
aVHow did this piece of 18th century Austrian aristocratic entertainment
p53
aVturn into the victory crow of this New York kid?
p54
aVHow was that passed on? How did he get to hear Mozart?
p55
aa(lp56
VWell when it comes to classical music,
p57
aVthere's an awful lot to pass on,
p58
aVmuch more than Mozart, Beethoven or Tchiakovsky.
p59
aVBecause classical music
p60
aVis an unbroken living tradition
p61
aVthat goes back over 1,000 years.
p62
aVAnd every one of those years
p63
aVhas had something unique and powerful to say to us
p64
aVabout what it's like to be alive.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow the raw material of it, of course,
p67
aVis just the music of everyday life.
p68
aVIt's all the anthems and dance crazes
p69
aVand ballads and marches.
p70
aVBut what classical music does
p71
aVis to distill all of these musics down,
p72
aVto condense them to their absolute essence,
p73
aVand from that essence create a new language,
p74
aVa language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly
p75
aVabout who we really are.
p76
aVIt's a language that's still evolving.
p77
aa(lp78
VNow over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of,
p79
aVlike concertos and symphonies,
p80
aVbut even the most ambitious masterpiece
p81
aVcan have as its central mission
p82
aVto bring you back to a fragile and personal moment \u2014
p83
aVlike this one from the Beethoven Violin Concerto.
p84
aV(Music)
p85
aVIt's so simple, so evocative.
p86
aVSo many emotions seem to be inside of it.
p87
aVYet, of course, like all music,
p88
aVit's essentially not about anything.
p89
aVIt's just a design of pitches and silence and time.
p90
aa(lp91
VAnd the pitches, the notes, as you know, are just vibrations.
p92
aVThey're locations in the spectrum of sound.
p93
aVAnd whether we call them 440 per second, A,
p94
aVor 3,729, B flat \u2014 trust me, that's right \u2014
p95
aVthey're just phenomena.
p96
aVBut the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena
p97
aVis complex and emotional and not totally understood.
p98
aVAnd the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries,
p99
aVas have our preferences for them.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo for example, in the 11th century,
p102
aVpeople liked pieces that ended like this.
p103
aV(Music)
p104
aVAnd in the 17th century, it was more like this.
p105
aV(Music)
p106
aVAnd in the 21st century ...
p107
aV(Music)
p108
aa(lp109
VNow your 21st century ears are quite happy with this last chord,
p110
aVeven though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you
p111
aVor sent some of you running from the room.
p112
aVAnd the reason you like it
p113
aVis because you've inherited, whether you knew it or not,
p114
aVcenturies-worth of changes
p115
aVin musical theory, practice and fashion.
p116
aa(lp117
VAnd in classical music we can follow these changes very, very accurately
p118
aVbecause of the music's powerful silent partner,
p119
aVthe way it's been passed on: notation.
p120
aVNow the impulse to notate,
p121
aVor, more exactly I should say, encode music
p122
aVhas been with us for a very long time.
p123
aVIn 200 B.C., a man named Sekulos
p124
aVwrote this song for his departed wife
p125
aVand inscribed it on her gravestone
p126
aVin the notational system of the Greeks.
p127
aV(Music)
p128
aa(lp129
VAnd a thousand years later,
p130
aVthis impulse to notate took an entirely different form.
p131
aVAnd you can see how this happened
p132
aVin these excerpts from the Christmas mass "Puer Natus est nobis,"
p133
aV"For Us is Born."
p134
aV(Music)
p135
aVIn the 10th century, little squiggles were used
p136
aVjust to indicate the general shape of the tune.
p137
aVAnd in the 12th century, a line was drawn, like a musical horizon line,
p138
aVto better pinpoint the pitch's location.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd then in the 13th century, more lines and new shapes of notes
p141
aVlocked in the concept of the tune exactly,
p142
aVand that led to the kind of notation we have today.
p143
aVWell notation not only passed the music on,
p144
aVnotating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely,
p145
aVbecause it enabled the musicians
p146
aVto imagine music on a much vaster scale.
p147
aa(lp148
VNow inspired moves of improvisation
p149
aVcould be recorded, saved, considered, prioritized,
p150
aVmade into intricate designs.
p151
aVAnd from this moment, classical music became
p152
aVwhat it most essentially is,
p153
aVa dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature:
p154
aVinstinct and intelligence.
p155
aa(lp156
VAnd there began to be a real difference at this point
p157
aVbetween the art of improvisation
p158
aVand the art of composition.
p159
aVNow an improviser senses and plays the next cool move,
p160
aVbut a composer is considering all possible moves,
p161
aVtesting them out, prioritizing them out,
p162
aVuntil he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent design
p163
aVof ultimate and enduring coolness.
p164
aVNow some of the greatest composers, like Bach,
p165
aVwere combinations of these two things.
p166
aVBach was like a great improviser with a mind of a chess master.
p167
aVMozart was the same way.
p168
aa(lp169
VBut every musician strikes a different balance
p170
aVbetween faith and reason, instinct and intelligence.
p171
aVAnd every musical era had different priorities of these things,
p172
aVdifferent things to pass on, different 'whats' and 'hows'.
p173
aVSo in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition
p174
aVthe big 'what' was to praise God.
p175
aVAnd by the 1400s, music was being written
p176
aVthat tried to mirror God's mind
p177
aVas could be seen in the design of the night sky.
p178
aVThe 'how' was a style called polyphony,
p179
aVmusic of many independently moving voices
p180
aVthat suggested the way the planets seemed to move
p181
aVin Ptolemy's geocentric universe.
p182
aVThis was truly the music of the spheres.
p183
aV(Music)
p184
aa(lp185
VThis is the kind of music that Leonardo DaVinci would have known.
p186
aVAnd perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity
p187
aVmeant that something new had to happen \u2014
p188
aVa radical new move, which in 1600 is what did happen.
p189
aV(Music) Singer: Ah, bitter blow!
p190
aVAh, wicked, cruel fate!
p191
aVAh, baleful stars!
p192
aVAh, avaricious heaven!
p193
aa(lp194
VMTT: This, of course, was the birth of opera,
p195
aVand its development put music on a radical new course.
p196
aVThe what now was not to mirror the mind of God,
p197
aVbut to follow the emotion turbulence of man.
p198
aVAnd the how was harmony,
p199
aVstacking up the pitches to form chords.
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd the chords, it turned out,
p202
aVwere capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions.
p203
aVAnd the basic chords were the ones we still have with us,
p204
aVthe triads,
p205
aVeither the major one,
p206
aVwhich we think is happy,
p207
aVor the minor one,
p208
aVwhich we perceive as sad.
p209
aVBut what's the actual difference between these two chords?
p210
aVIt's just these two notes in the middle.
p211
aVIt's either E natural,
p212
aVand 659 vibrations per second,
p213
aVor E flat, at 622.
p214
aVSo the big difference between human happiness and sadness?
p215
aV37 freakin' vibrations.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo you can see in a system like this
p218
aVthere was enormous subtle potential
p219
aVof representing human emotions.
p220
aVAnd in fact, as man began to understand more
p221
aVhis complex and ambivalent nature,
p222
aVharmony grew more complex to reflect it.
p223
aVTurns out it was capable of expressing emotions
p224
aVbeyond the ability of words.
p225
aa(lp226
VNow with all this possibility,
p227
aVclassical music really took off.
p228
aVIt's the time in which the big forms began to arise.
p229
aVAnd the effects of technology began to be felt also,
p230
aVbecause printing put music, the scores, the codebooks of music,
p231
aVinto the hands of performers everywhere.
p232
aVAnd new and improved instruments
p233
aVmade the age of the virtuoso possible.
p234
aVThis is when those big forms arose \u2014
p235
aVthe symphonies, the sonatas, the concertos.
p236
aa(lp237
VAnd in these big architectures of time,
p238
aVcomposers like Beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime.
p239
aVA piece like Beethoven's Fifth
p240
aVbasically witnessing how it was possible
p241
aVfor him to go from sorrow and anger,
p242
aVover the course of a half an hour,
p243
aVstep by exacting step of his route,
p244
aVto the moment when he could make it across to joy.
p245
aV(Music)
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues,
p248
aVlike gripping ones of culture,
p249
aVsuch as nationalism or quest for freedom
p250
aVor the frontiers of sensuality.
p251
aVBut whatever direction the music took,
p252
aVone thing until recently was always the same,
p253
aVand that was when the musicians stopped playing,
p254
aVthe music stopped.
p255
aa(lp256
VNow this moment so fascinates me.
p257
aVI find it such a profound one.
p258
aVWhat happens when the music stops?
p259
aVWhere does it go? What's left?
p260
aVWhat sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance?
p261
aVIs it a melody or a rhythm
p262
aVor a mood or an attitude?
p263
aVAnd how might that change their lives?
p264
aa(lp265
VTo me this is the intimate, personal side of music.
p266
aVIt's the passing on part. It's the 'why' part of it.
p267
aVAnd to me that's the most essential of all.
p268
aVMostly it's been a person-to-person thing,
p269
aVa teacher-student, performer-audience thing,
p270
aVand then around 1880 came this new technology
p271
aVthat first mechanically then through analogs then digitally
p272
aVcreated a new and miraculous way of passing things on,
p273
aValbeit an impersonal one.
p274
aVPeople could now hear music all the time,
p275
aVeven though it wasn't necessary
p276
aVfor them to play an instrument, read music or even go to concerts.
p277
aa(lp278
VAnd technology democratized music by making everything available.
p279
aVIt spearheaded a cultural revolution
p280
aVin which artists like Caruso and Bessie Smith were on the same footing.
p281
aVAnd technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes,
p282
aVusing computers and synthesizers
p283
aVto create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity
p284
aVbeyond the means of performers and audiences.
p285
aa(lp286
VAt the same time technology,
p287
aVby taking over the role that notation had always played,
p288
aVshifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence
p289
aVway over to the instinctive side.
p290
aVThe culture in which we live now
p291
aVis awash with music of improvisation
p292
aVthat's been sliced, diced, layered
p293
aVand, God knows, distributed and sold.
p294
aVWhat's the long-term effect of this on us or on music?
p295
aVNobody knows.
p296
aa(lp297
VThe question remains: What happens when the music stops?
p298
aVWhat sticks with people?
p299
aVNow that we have unlimited access to music, what does stick with us?
p300
aa(lp301
VWell let me show you a story of what I mean
p302
aVby "really sticking with us."
p303
aVI was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home,
p304
aVand I spied a very shaky old man
p305
aVmaking his way across the room on a walker.
p306
aVHe came over to a piano that was there,
p307
aVand he balanced himself and began playing something like this.
p308
aV(Music)
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd he said something like, "Me ... boy ... symphony ... Beethoven."
p311
aVAnd I suddenly got it,
p312
aVand I said, "Friend, by any chance are you trying to play this?"
p313
aV(Music)
p314
aVAnd he said, "Yes, yes. I was a little boy.
p315
aVThe symphony: Isaac Stern, the concerto, I heard it."
p316
aVAnd I thought, my God,
p317
aVhow much must this music mean to this man
p318
aVthat he would get himself out of his bed, across the room
p319
aVto recover the memory of this music
p320
aVthat, after everything else in his life is sloughing away,
p321
aVstill means so much to him?
p322
aa(lp323
VWell, that's why I take every performance so seriously,
p324
aVwhy it matters to me so much.
p325
aVI never know who might be there, who might be absorbing it
p326
aVand what will happen to it in their life.
p327
aa(lp328
VBut now I'm excited that there's more chance than ever before possible
p329
aVof sharing this music.
p330
aVThat's what drives my interest in projects
p331
aVlike the TV series "Keeping Score" with the San Francisco Symphony
p332
aVthat looks at the backstories of music,
p333
aVand working with the young musicians at the New World Symphony
p334
aVon projects that explore the potential
p335
aVof the new performing arts centers
p336
aVfor both entertainment and education.
p337
aa(lp338
VAnd of course, the New World Symphony
p339
aVled to the YouTube Symphony and projects on the internet
p340
aVthat reach out to musicians and audiences all over the world.
p341
aVAnd the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype.
p342
aVThere's just a role here for so many people \u2014
p343
aVteachers, parents, performers \u2014
p344
aVto be explorers together.
p345
aVSure, the big events attract a lot of attention,
p346
aVbut what really matters is what goes on every single day.
p347
aVWe need your perspectives, your curiosity, your voices.
p348
aa(lp349
VAnd it excites me now to meet people
p350
aVwho are hikers, chefs, code writers, taxi drivers,
p351
aVpeople I never would have guessed who loved the music
p352
aVand who are passing it on.
p353
aVYou don't need to worry about knowing anything.
p354
aVIf you're curious, if you have a capacity for wonder, if you're alive,
p355
aVyou know all that you need to know.
p356
aVYou can start anywhere. Ramble a bit.
p357
aVFollow traces. Get lost. Be surprised, amused inspired.
p358
aVAll that 'what', all that 'how' is out there
p359
aVwaiting for you to discover its 'why',
p360
aVto dive in and pass it on.
p361
