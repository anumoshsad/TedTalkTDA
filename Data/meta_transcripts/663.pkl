p1
(lp2
(lp3
VThe magical moment, the magical moment of conducting.
p4
aVWhich is, you go onto a stage. There is an orchestra sitting.
p5
aVThey are all, you know, warming up and doing stuff.
p6
aVAnd I go on the podium.
p7
aVYou know, this little office of the conductor.
p8
aVOr rather a cubicle, an open-space cubicle,
p9
aVwith a lot of space.
p10
aVAnd in front of all that noise,
p11
aVyou do a very small gesture.
p12
aVSomething like this, not very pomp, not very sophisticated, this.
p13
aVAnd suddenly, out of the chaos, order.
p14
aVNoise becomes music.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd this is fantastic. And it's so tempting
p17
aVto think that it's all about me.
p18
aV(Laughter)
p19
aVAll those great people here, virtuosos,
p20
aVthey make noise, they need me to do that.
p21
aVNot really. If it were that,
p22
aVI would just save you the talk,
p23
aVand teach you the gesture.
p24
aVSo you could go out to the world
p25
aVand do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want,
p26
aVand you have perfect harmony. It doesn't work.
p27
aVLet's look at the first video.
p28
aVI hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony.
p29
aVAnd then speak a little bit about how it comes about.
p30
aa(lp31
V(Music)
p32
aa(lp33
VWas that nice?
p34
aVSo that was a sort of a success.
p35
aVNow, who should we thank for the success?
p36
aVI mean, obviously the orchestra musicians
p37
aVplaying beautifully,
p38
aVthe Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.
p39
aVThey don't often even look at the conductor.
p40
aVThen you have the clapping audience, yeah,
p41
aVactually taking part in doing the music.
p42
aVYou know Viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music.
p43
aVThis is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feast
p44
aVthat you will ever get in Vienna.
p45
aV(Laughter)
p46
aa(lp47
VUnlike, for example Israel, where audiences cough all the time.
p48
aVYou know, Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, used to say
p49
aVthat, "Anywhere in the world, people that have the flu, they go to the doctor.
p50
aVIn Tel Aviv they come to my concerts."
p51
aV(Laughter)
p52
aVSo that's a sort of a tradition.
p53
aVBut Viennese audiences do not do that.
p54
aVHere they go out of their regular, just to be part of that,
p55
aVto become part of the orchestra, and that's great.
p56
aVYou know, audiences like you, yeah,
p57
aVmake the event.
p58
aa(lp59
VBut what about the conductor? What can you say
p60
aVthe conductor was doing, actually?
p61
aVUm, he was happy.
p62
aVAnd I often show this to senior management.
p63
aVPeople get annoyed.
p64
aV"You come to work. How come you're so happy?"
p65
aVSomething must be wrong there, yeah? But he's spreading happiness.
p66
aVAnd I think the happiness, the important thing is this happiness
p67
aVdoes not come from
p68
aVonly his own story and his joy of the music.
p69
aVThe joy is about enabling other people's stories
p70
aVto be heard at the same time.
p71
aa(lp72
VYou have the story of the orchestra as a professional body.
p73
aVYou have the story of the audience as a community. Yeah.
p74
aVYou have the stories of the individuals
p75
aVin the orchestra and in the audience.
p76
aVAnd then you have other stories, unseen.
p77
aVPeople who build this wonderful concert hall.
p78
aVPeople who made those Stradivarius, Amati, all those beautiful instruments.
p79
aVAnd all those stories are being heard at the same time.
p80
aVThis is the true experience of a live concert.
p81
aVThat's a reason to go out of home. Yeah?
p82
aVAnd not all conductors do just that.
p83
aVLet's see somebody else, a great conductor.
p84
aVRiccardo Muti, please.
p85
aa(lp86
V(Music)
p87
aa(lp88
VYeah, that was very short, but you could see
p89
aVit's a completely different figure. Right?
p90
aVHe's awesome. He's so commanding. Yeah?
p91
aVSo clear. Maybe a little bit over-clear.
p92
aVCan we have a little demonstration? Would you be my orchestra for a second?
p93
aVCan you sing, please, the first note of Don Giovanni?
p94
aVYou have to sing "Aaaaaah," and I'll stop you.
p95
aVOkay? Ready?
p96
aa(lp97
VAudience: \u266b Aaaaaaah ... \u266b
p98
aa(lp99
VItay Talgam: Come on, with me. If you do it without me
p100
aVI feel even more redundant than I already feel.
p101
aVSo please, wait for the conductor.
p102
aVNow look at me. "Aaaaaah," and I stop you. Let's go.
p103
aa(lp104
VAudience: \u266b ... Aaaaaaaah ... \u266b
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VItay Talgam: So we'll have a little chat later.
p108
aV(Laughter)
p109
aVBut ... There is a vacancy for a ...
p110
aVBut \u2014 (Laughter)
p111
aV\u2014 you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger.
p112
aVNow what does Riccardo Muti do? He does something like this ...
p113
aV(Laughter)
p114
aVAnd then \u2014 sort of \u2014 (Laughter)
p115
aVSo not only the instruction is clear,
p116
aVbut also the sanction, what will happen if you don't do what I tell you.
p117
aV(Laughter)
p118
aVSo, does it work? Yes, it works \u2014
p119
aVto a certain point.
p120
aa(lp121
VWhen Muti is asked, "Why do you conduct like this?"
p122
aVHe says, "I'm responsible."
p123
aVResponsible in front of him.
p124
aVNo he doesn't really mean Him. He means Mozart,
p125
aVwhich is \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 like a third seat from the center.
p126
aV(Laughter)
p127
aVSo he says, "If I'm \u2014
p128
aV(Applause)
p129
aVif I'm responsible for Mozart,
p130
aVthis is going to be the only story to be told.
p131
aVIt's Mozart as I, Riccardo Muti, understand it."
p132
aa(lp133
VAnd you know what happened to Muti?
p134
aVThree years ago he got a letter signed by
p135
aVall 700 employees of La Scala,
p136
aVmusical employees, I mean the musicians,
p137
aVsaying, "You're a great conductor. We don't want to work with you. Please resign."
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aV"Why? Because you don't let us develop.
p140
aVYou're using us as instruments, not as partners.
p141
aVAnd our joy of music, etc., etc. ..."
p142
aVSo he had to resign. Isn't that nice?
p143
aV(Laughter)
p144
aVHe's a nice guy. He's a really nice guy.
p145
aVWell, can you do it with less control,
p146
aVor with a different kind of control?
p147
aVLet's look at the next conductor, Richard Strauss.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Music)
p150
aa(lp151
VI'm afraid you'll get the feeling that I really picked on him because he's old.
p152
aVIt's not true. When he was a young man
p153
aVof about 30, he wrote what he called
p154
aV"The Ten Commandments for Conductors."
p155
aVThe first one was: If you sweat by the end of the concert
p156
aVit means that you must have done something wrong.
p157
aVThat's the first one. The fourth one you'll like better.
p158
aVIt says: Never look at the trombones \u2014
p159
aVit only encourages them.
p160
aV(Laughter)
p161
aa(lp162
VSo, the whole idea is really to let
p163
aVit happen by itself.
p164
aVDo not interfere.
p165
aVBut how does it happen? Did you see
p166
aVhim turning pages in the score?
p167
aVNow, either he is senile,
p168
aVand doesn't remember his own music, because he wrote the music.
p169
aVOr he is actually transferring a very strong message to them, saying,
p170
aV"Come on guys. You have to play by the book.
p171
aVSo it's not about my story. It's not about your story.
p172
aVIt's only the execution of the written music,
p173
aVno interpretation."
p174
aVInterpretation is the real story of the performer.
p175
aVSo, no, he doesn't want that. That's a different kind of control.
p176
aVLet's see another super-conductor,
p177
aVa German super-conductor. Herbert von Karajan, please.
p178
aa(lp179
V(Music)
p180
aa(lp181
VWhat's different? Did you see the eyes? Closed.
p182
aVDid you see the hands?
p183
aVDid you see this kind of movement? Let me conduct you. Twice.
p184
aVOnce like a Muti, and you'll \u2014 (Claps) \u2014 clap, just once.
p185
aVAnd then like Karajan. Let's see what happens. Okay?
p186
aVLike Muti. You ready? Because Muti ...
p187
aV(Laughter) Okay? Ready? Let's do it.
p188
aa(lp189
VAudience: (Claps)
p190
aa(lp191
VItay Talgam: Hmm ... again.
p192
aa(lp193
VAudience: (Claps)
p194
aVItay Talgam: Good. Now like a Karajan. Since you're already trained,
p195
aVlet me concentrate, close my eyes. Come, come.
p196
aa(lp197
VAudience: (Claps) (Laughter)
p198
aa(lp199
VItay Talgam: Why not together? (Laughter)
p200
aVBecause you didn't know when to play.
p201
aVNow I can tell you, even the Berlin Philharmonic
p202
aVdoesn't know when to play.
p203
aV(Laughter)
p204
aVBut I'll tell you how they do it. No cynicism.
p205
aVThis is a German orchestra, yes?
p206
aVThey look at Karajan. And then they look at each other.
p207
aV(Laughter)
p208
aV"Do you understand what this guy wants?"
p209
aVAnd after doing that,
p210
aVthey really look at each other, and the first players of the orchestra
p211
aVlead the whole ensemble in playing together.
p212
aa(lp213
VAnd when Karajan is asked about it
p214
aVhe actually says, "Yes, the worst damage
p215
aVI can do to my orchestra
p216
aVis to give them a clear instruction.
p217
aVBecause that would
p218
aVprevent the ensemble, the listening to each other
p219
aVthat is needed for an orchestra."
p220
aVNow that's great. What about the eyes?
p221
aVWhy are the eyes closed?
p222
aVThere is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London.
p223
aVAnd he cues in a flute player like this.
p224
aVThe guy has no idea what to do. (Laughter)
p225
aV"Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?"
p226
aVWhat do you think Karajan's reply was? When should I start?
p227
aVOh yeah. He says, "You start when you can't stand it anymore."
p228
aV(Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VMeaning that you know you have no authority to change anything.
p231
aVIt's my music. The real music is only in Karajan's head.
p232
aVAnd you have to guess my mind. So you are under tremendous pressure
p233
aVbecause I don't give you instruction,
p234
aVand yet, you have to guess my mind.
p235
aVSo it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet
p236
aVvery firm control.
p237
aVCan we do it in another way? Of course we can. Let's go back
p238
aVto the first conductor we've seen:
p239
aVCarlos Kleiber, his name. Next video, please.
p240
aa(lp241
V(Music)
p242
aa(lp243
V(Laughter) Yeah.
p244
aVWell, it is different. But isn't that controlling in the same way?
p245
aVNo, it's not, because he is not telling them what to do.
p246
aVWhen he does this, it's not,
p247
aV"Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix,
p248
aVsmash it on the floor." It's not that.
p249
aVHe says, "This is the gesture of the music.
p250
aVI'm opening a space for you
p251
aVto put in another layer
p252
aVof interpretation."
p253
aVThat is another story.
p254
aa(lp255
VBut how does it really work together
p256
aVif it doesn't give them instructions?
p257
aVIt's like being on a rollercoaster. Yeah?
p258
aVYou're not really given any instructions,
p259
aVbut the forces of the process itself keep you in place.
p260
aVThat's what he does.
p261
aVThe interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist.
p262
aVIt's not a physical thing. It's in the players' heads.
p263
aa(lp264
VAnd that's what makes them into partners.
p265
aVYou have the plan in your head.
p266
aVYou know what to do, even though Kleiber is not conducting you.
p267
aVBut here and there and that. You know what to do.
p268
aVAnd you become a partner building the rollercoaster,
p269
aVyeah, with sound,
p270
aVas you actually take the ride.
p271
aVThis is very exciting for those players.
p272
aVThey do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks, later.
p273
aV(Laughter)
p274
aVIt is very tiring. Yeah?
p275
aVBut it's the best music making, like this.
p276
aa(lp277
VBut of course it's not only about motivation
p278
aVand giving them a lot of physical energy.
p279
aVYou also have to be very professional.
p280
aVAnd look again at this Kleiber.
p281
aVCan we have the next video, quickly?
p282
aVYou'll see what happens when there is a mistake.
p283
aa(lp284
V(Music) Again you see the beautiful body language.
p285
aV(Music)
p286
aVAnd now there is a trumpet player who
p287
aVdoes something not exactly the way it should be done.
p288
aVGo along with the video. Look.
p289
aVSee, second time for the same player.
p290
aV(Laughter) And now the third time for the same player.
p291
aV(Laughter)
p292
aV"Wait for me after the concert.
p293
aVI have a short notice to give you."
p294
aVYou know, when it's needed, the authority is there. It's very important.
p295
aVBut authority is not enough to make people your partners.
p296
aa(lp297
VLet's see the next video, please. See what happens here.
p298
aVYou might be surprised having seen Kleiber
p299
aVas such a hyperactive guy.
p300
aVHe's conducting Mozart.
p301
aV(Music)
p302
aVThe whole orchestra is playing.
p303
aV(Music)
p304
aVNow something else.
p305
aV(Music)
p306
aVSee? He is there 100 percent,
p307
aVbut not commanding, not telling what to do.
p308
aVRather enjoying what the soloist is doing.
p309
aV(Music)
p310
aa(lp311
VAnother solo now. See what you can pick up from this.
p312
aV(Music)
p313
aVLook at the eyes.
p314
aVOkay. You see that?
p315
aVFirst of all, it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get.
p316
aVIt's not feedback. It's an "Mmmm ..." Yeah, it comes from here.
p317
aVSo that's a good thing.
p318
aVAnd the second thing is
p319
aVit's about actually being in control,
p320
aVbut in a very special way.
p321
aVWhen Kleiber does \u2014 did you see the eyes,
p322
aVgoing from here? (Singing)
p323
aVYou know what happens? Gravitation is no more.
p324
aa(lp325
VKleiber not only creates a process,
p326
aVbut also creates the conditions in the world
p327
aVin which this process takes place.
p328
aVSo again, the oboe player
p329
aVis completely autonomous
p330
aVand therefore happy and proud of his work,
p331
aVand creative and all of that.
p332
aVAnd the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level.
p333
aVSo control is no longer a zero-sum game.
p334
aVYou have this control. You have this control. And all you put together,
p335
aVin partnership, brings about the best music.
p336
aVSo Kleiber is about process.
p337
aVKleiber is about conditions in the world.
p338
aa(lp339
VBut you need to have process and content to create the meaning.
p340
aVLenny Bernstein, my own personal maestro.
p341
aVSince he was a great teacher,
p342
aVLenny Bernstein always started from the meaning. Look at this, please.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Music)
p345
aa(lp346
VDo you remember the face of Muti, at the beginning?
p347
aVWell he had a wonderful expression, but only one.
p348
aV(Laughter)
p349
aVDid you see Lenny's face?
p350
aVYou know why? Because the meaning of the music is pain.
p351
aVAnd you're playing a painful sound.
p352
aVAnd you look at Lenny and he's suffering.
p353
aVBut not in a way that you want to stop.
p354
aVIt's suffering, like, enjoying himself in a Jewish way, as they say.
p355
aV(Laughter)
p356
aVBut you can see the music on his face.
p357
aVYou can see the baton left his hand. No more baton.
p358
aVNow it's about you, the player,
p359
aVtelling the story.
p360
aVNow it's a reversed thing. You're telling the story. And you're telling the story.
p361
aVAnd even briefly, you become the storyteller
p362
aVto which the community, the whole community, listens to.
p363
aVAnd Bernstein enables that. Isn't that wonderful?
p364
aa(lp365
VNow, if you are doing all the things we talked about, together,
p366
aVand maybe some others,
p367
aVyou can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing.
p368
aVAnd for the last video, I think this is simply the best title.
p369
aVMy friend Peter says,
p370
aV"If you love something, give it away." So, please.
