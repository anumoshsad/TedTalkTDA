VHannah is excited to be going to college.
p4
aVShe couldn't wait to get out of her parents' house,
p5
aVto prove to them that she's an adult,
p6
aVand to prove to her new friends that she belongs.
p7
aa(lp8
VShe heads to a campus party
p9
aVwhere she sees a guy that she has a crush on.
p10
aVLet's call him Mike.
p11
aVThe next day, Hannah wakes up with a pounding headache.
p12
aVShe can only remember the night in flashes.
p13
aVBut what she does remember is
p14
aVthrowing up in the hall outside Mike's room
p15
aVand staring at the wall silently while he was inside her,
p16
aVwanting it to stop,
p17
aVthen shakily stumbling home.
p18
aVShe doesn't feel good about what happened,
p19
aVbut she thinks, "Maybe this is just what sex in college is?"
p20
aa(lp21
VOne in five women and one in 13 men will be sexually assaulted
p22
aVat some point during their college career in the United States.
p23
aVLess than 10 percent will ever report their assault to their school
p24
aVor to the police.
p25
aVAnd those who do, on average, wait 11 months to make the report.
p26
aa(lp27
VHannah initially just feels like dealing with what happened on her own.
p28
aVBut when she sees Mike taking girls home from parties,
p29
aVshe's worried about them.
p30
aa(lp31
VAfter graduation, Hannah learns
p32
aVthat she was one of five women who Mike did the exact same thing to.
p33
aVAnd this is not an unlikely scenario
p34
aVbecause 90 percent of sexual assaults
p35
aVare committed by repeat offenders.
p36
aVBut with such low reporting rates,
p37
aVit's fairly unlikely that even repeat perpetrators will be reported,
p38
aVmuch less anything happen if they are.
p39
aa(lp40
VIn fact, only six percent of assaults reported to the police
p41
aVend with the assailant spending a single day in prison.
p42
aVMeaning, there's a 99 percent chance that they'll get away with it.
p43
aVThis means there's practically no deterrent to assault
p44
aVin the United States.
p45
aa(lp46
VNow, I'm an infectious disease epidemiologist by training.
p47
aVI'm interested in systems and networks
p48
aVand where we can concentrate our resources to do the most good.
p49
aVSo this, to me, is a tragic but a solvable problem.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo when the issue of campus assault started hitting the news a few years ago,
p52
aVit felt like a unique opportunity to make a change.
p53
aVAnd so we did.
p54
aVWe started by talking to college survivors.
p55
aVAnd what they wish they'd had in college is pretty simple;
p56
aVthey wanted a website,
p57
aVone they could use at the time and place
p58
aVthat felt safest to them
p59
aVwith clearly written information about their reporting options,
p60
aVwith the ability to electronically report their assault,
p61
aVrather than having the first step
p62
aVto go in and talk to someone who may or may not believe them.
p63
aVWith the option to create a secure, timestamped document
p64
aVof what happened to them,
p65
aVpreserving evidence even if they don't want to report yet.
p66
aVAnd lastly, and perhaps most critically,
p67
aVwith the ability to report their assault
p68
aVonly if someone else reported the same assailant.
p69
aVYou see, knowing that you weren't the only one changes everything.
p70
aVIt changes the way you frame your own experience,
p71
aVit changes the way you think about your perpetrator,
p72
aVit means that if you do come forward,
p73
aVyou'll have someone else's back and they'll have yours.
p74
aa(lp75
VWe created a website that actually does this
p76
aVand we launched it [...] in August,
p77
aVon two college campuses.
p78
aa(lp79
VAnd we included a unique matching system
p80
aVwhere if Mike's first victim had come forward,
p81
aVsaved her record, entered into the matching system
p82
aVand named Mike,
p83
aVand Mike's second victim had done the same thing
p84
aVa few months later,
p85
aVthey would have matched
p86
aVand the verified contact information of both survivors
p87
aVwould have been sent to the authorities at the same time
p88
aVfor investigation and follow up.
p89
aa(lp90
VIf a system like this had existed for Hannah and her peers,
p91
aVit's more likely that they would have reported,
p92
aVthat they would have been believed,
p93
aVand that Mike would have been kicked off campus,
p94
aVgone to jail, or at least gotten the help that he needed.
p95
aVAnd if we were able to stop repeat offenders like Mike
p96
aVafter just their second assault following a match,
p97
aVsurvivors like Hannah would never even be assaulted
p98
aVin the first place.
p99
aVWe could prevent 59 percent of sexual assaults
p100
aVjust by stopping repeat perpetrators earlier on.
p101
aVAnd because we're creating a real deterrent to assault,
p102
aVfor perhaps the first time,
p103
aVmaybe the Mikes of the world would never even try to assault anyone.
p104
aa(lp105
VThe type of system I'm describing,
p106
aVthe type of system that survivors want
p107
aVis a type of information escrow,
p108
aVmeaning an entity that holds on to information for you
p109
aVand only releases it to a third party
p110
aVwhen certain pre-agreed upon conditions are met,
p111
aVsuch as a match.
p112
aVThe application that we built is for college campuses.
p113
aVBut the same type of system could be used in the military
p114
aVor even the workplace.
p115
aa(lp116
VWe don't have to live in a world
p117
aVwhere 99 percent of rapists get away with it.
p118
aVWe can create one
p119
aVwhere those who do wrong are held accountable,
p120
aVwhere survivors get the support and justice they deserve,
p121
aVwhere the authorities get the information they need,
p122
aVand where there's a real deterrent
p123
aVto violating the rights of another human being.
