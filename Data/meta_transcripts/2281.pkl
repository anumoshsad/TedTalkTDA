VThe first time I uttered a prayer was in a glass-stained cathedral.
p4
aa(lp5
VI was kneeling long after the congregation was on its feet,
p6
aa(lp7
Vdip both hands into holy water,
p8
aa(lp9
Vtrace the trinity across my chest,
p10
aa(lp11
Vmy tiny body drooping  like a question mark
p12
aa(lp13
Vall over the wooden pew.
p14
aa(lp15
VI asked Jesus to fix me,
p16
aa(lp17
Vand when he did not answer
p18
aa(lp19
VI befriended silence in the hopes that my sin would burn
p20
aa(lp21
Vand salve my mouth
p22
aVwould dissolve like sugar on tongue,
p23
aa(lp24
Vbut shame lingered as an aftertaste.
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd in an attempt to reintroduce me to sanctity,
p27
aa(lp28
Vmy mother told me of the miracle I was,
p29
aa(lp30
Vsaid I could grow up  to be anything I want.
p31
aa(lp32
VI decided to
p33
aVbe a boy.
p34
aa(lp35
VIt was cute.
p36
aa(lp37
VI had snapback, toothless grin,
p38
aa(lp39
Vused skinned knees as street cred,
p40
aa(lp41
Vplayed hide and seek with  what was left of my goal.
p42
aa(lp43
VI was it.
p44
aa(lp45
VThe winner to a game  the other kids couldn't play,
p46
aa(lp47
VI was the mystery of an anatomy,
p48
aa(lp49
Va question asked but not answered,
p50
aa(lp51
Vtightroping between awkward boy and apologetic girl,
p52
aa(lp53
Vand when I turned 12, the boy phase wasn't deemed cute anymore.
p54
aa(lp55
VIt was met with nostalgic aunts who missed seeing my knees in the shadow of skirts,
p56
aa(lp57
Vwho reminded me that my kind of attitude would never bring a husband home,
p58
aa(lp59
Vthat I exist for heterosexual marriage and child-bearing.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd I swallowed their insults along with their slurs.
p62
aa(lp63
VNaturally, I did not come out of the closet.
p64
aa(lp65
VThe kids at my school opened it without my permission.
p66
aa(lp67
VCalled me by a name I did not recognize,
p68
aa(lp69
Vsaid "lesbian,"
p70
aa(lp71
Vbut I was more boy than girl, more Ken than Barbie.
p72
aa(lp73
VIt had nothing to do with hating my body,
p74
aa(lp75
VI just love it enough to let it go,
p76
aa(lp77
VI treat it like a house,
p78
aa(lp79
Vand when your house is falling apart,
p80
aa(lp81
Vyou do not evacuate,
p82
aa(lp83
Vyou make it comfortable enough to house all your insides,
p84
aa(lp85
Vyou make it pretty enough to invite guests over,
p86
aa(lp87
Vyou make the floorboards strong enough to stand on.
p88
aa(lp89
VMy mother fears I have named myself after fading things.
p90
aa(lp91
VAs she counts the echoes left behind by Mya Hall,
p92
aVLeelah Alcorn, Blake Brockington.
p93
aa(lp94
VShe fears that I'll die without a whisper,
p95
aa(lp96
Vthat I'll turn into "what a shame" conversations at the bus stop.
p97
aa(lp98
VShe claims I have turned myself into a mausoleum,
p99
aa(lp100
Vthat I am a walking casket,
p101
aa(lp102
Vnews headlines have turned my identity into a spectacle,
p103
aa(lp104
VBruce Jenner on everyone's lips while the brutality of living in this body
p105
aa(lp106
Vbecomes an asterisk  at the bottom of equality pages.
p107
aa(lp108
VNo one ever thinks of us as human
p109
aa(lp110
Vbecause we are more ghost than flesh,
p111
aa(lp112
Vbecause people fear that my gender expression is a trick,
p113
aa(lp114
Vthat it exists to be perverse,
p115
aa(lp116
Vthat it ensnares them without their consent,
p117
aa(lp118
Vthat my body is a feast for their eyes and hands
p119
aa(lp120
Vand once they have fed off my queer,
p121
aa(lp122
Vthey'll regurgitate all the parts they did not like.
p123
aa(lp124
VThey'll put me back into the closet, hang me with all the other skeletons.
p125
aa(lp126
VI will be the best attraction.
p127
aa(lp128
VCan you see how easy it is to talk people into coffins,
p129
aa(lp130
Vto misspell their names on gravestones.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd people still wonder why there are boys rotting,
p133
aa(lp134
Vthey go away in high school hallways
p135
aa(lp136
Vthey are afraid of becoming another hashtag in a second
p137
aa(lp138
Vafraid of classroom discussions becoming like judgment day
p139
aa(lp140
Vand now oncoming traffic is embracing more transgender children than parents.
p141
aa(lp142
VI wonder how long it will be
p143
aa(lp144
Vbefore the trans suicide notes start to feel redundant,
p145
aa(lp146
Vbefore we realize that our bodies become lessons about sin
p147
aa(lp148
Vway before we learn how to love them.
p149
aa(lp150
VLike God didn't save all this breath and mercy,
p151
aa(lp152
Vlike my blood is not the wine that washed over Jesus' feet.
p153
aa(lp154
VMy prayers are now getting stuck in my throat.
p155
aa(lp156
VMaybe I am finally fixed,
p157
aa(lp158
Vmaybe I just don't care,
p159
aa(lp160
Vmaybe God finally listened to my prayers.
p161
aa(lp162
VThank you.
