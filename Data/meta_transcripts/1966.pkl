VWhen people think about cities,
p4
aVthey tend to think of certain things.
p5
aVThey think of buildings and streets
p6
aVand skyscrapers, noisy cabs.
p7
aVBut when I think about cities,
p8
aVI think about people.
p9
aVCities are fundamentally about people,
p10
aVand where people go
p11
aVand where people meet
p12
aVare at the core of what makes a city work.
p13
aVSo even more important than buildings in a city
p14
aVare the public spaces in between them.
p15
aVAnd today, some of the most transformative
p16
aVchanges in cities
p17
aVare happening in these public spaces.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo I believe that lively, enjoyable public spaces
p20
aVare the key to planning a great city.
p21
aVThey are what makes it come alive.
p22
aVBut what makes a public space work?
p23
aVWhat attracts people to successful public spaces,
p24
aVand what is it about unsuccessful places
p25
aVthat keeps people away?
p26
aVI thought, if I could answer those questions,
p27
aVI could make a huge contribution to my city.
p28
aVBut one of the more wonky things about me
p29
aVis that I am an animal behaviorist,
p30
aVand I use those skills not to study animal behavior
p31
aVbut to study how people in cities
p32
aVuse city public spaces.
p33
aa(lp34
VOne of the first spaces that I studied
p35
aVwas this little vest pocket park called Paley Park
p36
aVin midtown Manhattan.
p37
aVThis little space became a small phenomenon,
p38
aVand because it had such a profound impact
p39
aVon New Yorkers,
p40
aVit made an enormous impression on me.
p41
aVI studied this park very early on in my career
p42
aVbecause it happened to have been built
p43
aVby my stepfather,
p44
aVso I knew that places like Paley Park
p45
aVdidn't happen by accident.
p46
aVI saw firsthand that they required
p47
aVincredible dedication
p48
aVand enormous attention to detail.
p49
aVBut what was it about this space
p50
aVthat made it special and drew people to it?
p51
aVWell, I would sit in the park and watch very carefully,
p52
aVand first among other things
p53
aVwere the comfortable, movable chairs.
p54
aVPeople would come in, find their own seat,
p55
aVmove it a bit, actually, and then stay a while,
p56
aVand then interestingly,
p57
aVpeople themselves attracted other people,
p58
aVand ironically, I felt more peaceful
p59
aVif there were other people around.
p60
aVAnd it was green.
p61
aVThis little park provided what New Yorkers crave:
p62
aVcomfort and greenery.
p63
aVBut my question was,
p64
aVwhy weren't there more places with greenery
p65
aVand places to sit in the middle of the city
p66
aVwhere you didn't feel alone,
p67
aVor like a trespasser?
p68
aVUnfortunately, that's not how cities
p69
aVwere being designed.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo here you see a familiar sight.
p72
aVThis is how plazas have been designed for generations.
p73
aVThey have that stylish, Spartan look
p74
aVthat we often associate with modern architecture,
p75
aVbut it's not surprising that people
p76
aVavoid spaces like this.
p77
aVThey not only look desolate,
p78
aVthey feel downright dangerous.
p79
aVI mean, where would you sit here?
p80
aVWhat would you do here?
p81
aVBut architects love them.
p82
aVThey are plinths for their creations.
p83
aVThey might tolerate a sculpture or two,
p84
aVbut that's about it.
p85
aVAnd for developers, they are ideal.
p86
aVThere's nothing to water, nothing to maintain,
p87
aVand no undesirable people to worry about.
p88
aVBut don't you think this is a waste?
p89
aVFor me, becoming a city planner
p90
aVmeant being able to truly change the city
p91
aVthat I lived in and loved.
p92
aVI wanted to be able to create places
p93
aVthat would give you the feeling that you got
p94
aVin Paley Park,
p95
aVand not allow developers to build bleak plazas like this.
p96
aVBut over the many years,
p97
aVI have learned how hard it is
p98
aVto create successful, meaningful,
p99
aVenjoyable public spaces.
p100
aVAs I learned from my stepfather,
p101
aVthey certainly do not happen by accident,
p102
aVespecially in a city like New York,
p103
aVwhere public space has to be fought for to begin with,
p104
aVand then for them to be successful,
p105
aVsomebody has to think very hard
p106
aVabout every detail.
p107
aa(lp108
VNow, open spaces in cities are opportunities.
p109
aVYes, they are opportunities for commercial investment,
p110
aVbut they are also opportunities for the common good
p111
aVof the city,
p112
aVand those two goals are often not aligned with one another,
p113
aVand therein lies the conflict.
p114
aa(lp115
VThe first opportunity I had to fight
p116
aVfor a great public open space was in the early 1980s,
p117
aVwhen I was leading a team of planners
p118
aVat a gigantic landfill called Battery Park City
p119
aVin lower Manhattan on the Hudson River.
p120
aVAnd this sandy wasteland had lain barren
p121
aVfor 10 years,
p122
aVand we were told, unless we found a developer
p123
aVin six months, it would go bankrupt.
p124
aVSo we came up with a radical,
p125
aValmost insane idea.
p126
aVInstead of building a park
p127
aVas a complement to future development,
p128
aVwhy don't we reverse that equation
p129
aVand build a small but very high-quality
p130
aVpublic open space first,
p131
aVand see if that made a difference.
p132
aVSo we only could afford to build a two-block section
p133
aVof what would become a mile-long esplanade,
p134
aVso whatever we built had to be perfect.
p135
aVSo just to make sure, I insisted
p136
aVthat we build a mock-up
p137
aVin wood, at scale, of the railing and the sea wall.
p138
aVAnd when I sat down on that test bench
p139
aVwith sand still swirling all around me,
p140
aVthe railing hit exactly at eye level,
p141
aVblocking my view and ruining my experience
p142
aVat the water's edge.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo you see, details really do make a difference.
p145
aVBut design is not just how something looks,
p146
aVit's how your body feels on that seat in that space,
p147
aVand I believe that successful design always depends
p148
aVon that very individual experience.
p149
aVIn this photo, everything looks very finished,
p150
aVbut that granite edge, those lights,
p151
aVthe back on that bench,
p152
aVthe trees in planting,
p153
aVand the many different kinds of places to sit
p154
aVwere all little battles that turned this project
p155
aVinto a place that people wanted to be.
p156
aa(lp157
VNow, this proved very valuable 20 years later
p158
aVwhen Michael Bloomberg asked me to be
p159
aVhis planning commissioner
p160
aVand put me in charge of shaping
p161
aVthe entire city of New York.
p162
aVAnd he said to me on that very day,
p163
aVhe said that New York was projected
p164
aVto grow from eight to nine million people.
p165
aVAnd he asked me,
p166
aV"So where are you going to put
p167
aVone million additional New Yorkers?"
p168
aa(lp169
VWell, I didn't have any idea.
p170
aVNow, you know that New York does
p171
aVplace a high value on attracting immigrants,
p172
aVso we were excited about the prospect of growth,
p173
aVbut honestly, where were we going to grow
p174
aVin a city that was already built out to its edges
p175
aVand surrounded by water?
p176
aVHow were we going to find housing
p177
aVfor that many new New Yorkers?
p178
aVAnd if we couldn't spread out,
p179
aVwhich was probably a good thing,
p180
aVwhere could new housing go?
p181
aVAnd what about cars?
p182
aVOur city couldn't possibly handle any more cars.
p183
aa(lp184
VSo what were we going to do?
p185
aVIf we couldn't spread out, we had to go up.
p186
aVAnd if we had to go up,
p187
aVwe had to go up in places
p188
aVwhere you wouldn't need to own a car.
p189
aVSo that meant using one of our greatest assets:
p190
aVour transit system.
p191
aVBut we had never before thought
p192
aVof how we could make the most of it.
p193
aVSo here was the answer to our puzzle.
p194
aVIf we were to channel and redirect
p195
aVall new development around transit,
p196
aVwe could actually handle that population increase,
p197
aVwe thought.
p198
aVAnd so here was the plan,
p199
aVwhat we really needed to do:
p200
aVWe needed to redo our zoning \u2014
p201
aVand zoning is the city planner's regulatory tool \u2014
p202
aVand basically reshape the entire city,
p203
aVtargeting where new development could go
p204
aVand prohibiting any development at all
p205
aVin our car-oriented,
p206
aVsuburban-style neighborhoods.
p207
aVWell, this was an unbelievably ambitious idea,
p208
aVambitious because communities
p209
aVhad to approve those plans.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo how was I going to get this done?
p212
aVBy listening. So I began listening,
p213
aVin fact, thousands of hours of listening
p214
aVjust to establish trust.
p215
aVYou know, communities can tell
p216
aVwhether or not you understand their neighborhoods.
p217
aVIt's not something you can just fake.
p218
aVAnd so I began walking.
p219
aVI can't tell you how many blocks I walked,
p220
aVin sweltering summers, in freezing winters,
p221
aVyear after year,
p222
aVjust so I could get to understand
p223
aVthe DNA of each neighborhood
p224
aVand know what each street felt like.
p225
aVI became an incredibly geeky zoning expert,
p226
aVfinding ways that zoning could address
p227
aVcommunities' concerns.
p228
aVSo little by little, neighborhood by neighborhood,
p229
aVblock by block,
p230
aVwe began to set height limits
p231
aVso that all new development
p232
aVwould be predictable and near transit.
p233
aVOver the course of 12 years,
p234
aVwe were able to rezone
p235
aV124 neighborhoods,
p236
aV40 percent of the city,
p237
aV12,500 blocks, so that now,
p238
aV90 percent of all new development of New York
p239
aVis within a 10-minute walk of a subway.
p240
aVIn other words, nobody in those new buildings
p241
aVneeds to own a car.
p242
aa(lp243
VWell, those rezonings were exhausting
p244
aVand enervating and important,
p245
aVbut rezoning was never my mission.
p246
aVYou can't see zoning and you can't feel zoning.
p247
aVMy mission was always to create
p248
aVgreat public spaces.
p249
aVSo in the areas where we zoned for significant development,
p250
aVI was determined to create places
p251
aVthat would make a difference in people's lives.
p252
aVHere you see what was
p253
aVtwo miles of abandoned, degraded waterfront
p254
aVin the neighborhoods of Greenpoint
p255
aVand Williamsburg in Brooklyn,
p256
aVimpossible to get to and impossible to use.
p257
aVNow the zoning here was massive,
p258
aVso I felt an obligation to create
p259
aVmagnificent parks on these waterfronts,
p260
aVand I spent an incredible amount of time
p261
aVon every square inch of these plans.
p262
aVI wanted to make sure that there were
p263
aVtree-lined paths from the upland to the water,
p264
aVthat there were trees and plantings everywhere,
p265
aVand, of course, lots and lots of places to sit.
p266
aVHonestly, I had no idea how it would turn out.
p267
aVI had to have faith.
p268
aVBut I put everything that I had studied and learned
p269
aVinto those plans.
p270
aa(lp271
VAnd then it opened,
p272
aVand I have to tell you, it was incredible.
p273
aVPeople came from all over the city
p274
aVto be in these parks.
p275
aVI know they changed the lives of the people who live there,
p276
aVbut they also changed New Yorkers' whole image
p277
aVof their city.
p278
aVI often come down and watch people
p279
aVget on this little ferry
p280
aVthat now runs between the boroughs,
p281
aVand I can't tell you why,
p282
aVbut I'm completely moved
p283
aVby the fact that people are using it
p284
aVas if it had always been there.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd here is a new park in lower Manhattan.
p287
aVNow, the water's edge in lower Manhattan
p288
aVwas a complete mess before 9/11.
p289
aVWall Street was essentially landlocked
p290
aVbecause you couldn't get anywhere near this edge.
p291
aVAnd after 9/11, the city had very little control.
p292
aVBut I thought if we went
p293
aVto the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation
p294
aVand got money to reclaim this two miles
p295
aVof degraded waterfront
p296
aVthat it would have an enormous effect
p297
aVon the rebuilding of lower Manhattan.
p298
aVAnd it did.
p299
aVLower Manhattan finally has a public waterfront
p300
aVon all three sides.
p301
aa(lp302
VI really love this park.
p303
aVYou know, railings have to be higher now,
p304
aVso we put bar seating at the edge,
p305
aVand you can get so close to the water
p306
aVyou're practically on it.
p307
aVAnd see how the railing widens
p308
aVand flattens out so you can lay down
p309
aVyour lunch or your laptop.
p310
aVAnd I love when people come there
p311
aVand look up and they say,
p312
aV"Wow, there's Brooklyn, and it's so close."
p313
aa(lp314
VSo what's the trick?
p315
aVHow do you turn a park
p316
aVinto a place that people want to be?
p317
aVWell, it's up to you,
p318
aVnot as a city planner but as a human being.
p319
aVYou don't tap into your design expertise.
p320
aVYou tap into your humanity.
p321
aVI mean, would you want to go there?
p322
aVWould you want to stay there?
p323
aVCan you see into it and out of it?
p324
aVAre there other people there?
p325
aVDoes it seem green and friendly?
p326
aVCan you find your very own seat?
p327
aa(lp328
VWell now, all over New York City,
p329
aVthere are places where you can
p330
aVfind your very own seat.
p331
aVWhere there used to be parking spaces,
p332
aVthere are now pop-up cafes.
p333
aVWhere Broadway traffic used to run,
p334
aVthere are now tables and chairs.
p335
aVWhere 12 years ago, sidewalk cafes were not allowed,
p336
aVthey are now everywhere.
p337
aVBut claiming these spaces for public use
p338
aVwas not simple,
p339
aVand it's even harder to keep them that way.
p340
aa(lp341
VSo now I'm going to tell you a story
p342
aVabout a very unusual park called the High Line.
p343
aVThe High Line was an elevated railway.
p344
aV(Applause)
p345
aVThe High Line was an elevated railway
p346
aVthat ran through three neighborhoods
p347
aVon Manhattan's West Side,
p348
aVand when the train stopped running,
p349
aVit became a self-seeded landscape,
p350
aVa kind of a garden in the sky.
p351
aVAnd when I saw it the first time,
p352
aVhonestly, when I went up on that old viaduct,
p353
aVI fell in love the way you fall in love with a person,
p354
aVhonestly.
p355
aVAnd when I was appointed,
p356
aVsaving the first two sections of the High Line
p357
aVfrom demolition became my first priority
p358
aVand my most important project.
p359
aVI knew if there was a day that I didn't
p360
aVworry about the High Line, it would come down.
p361
aVAnd the High Line,
p362
aVeven though it is widely known now
p363
aVand phenomenally popular,
p364
aVit is the most contested public space in the city.
p365
aVYou might see a beautiful park,
p366
aVbut not everyone does.
p367
aVYou know, it's true, commercial interests
p368
aVwill always battle against public space.
p369
aVYou might say,
p370
aV"How wonderful it is that more than
p371
aVfour million people come from all over the world
p372
aVto visit the High Line."
p373
aVWell, a developer sees just one thing: customers.
p374
aVHey, why not take out those plantings
p375
aVand have shops all along the High Line?
p376
aVWouldn't that be terrific
p377
aVand won't it mean a lot more money for the city?
p378
aVWell no, it would not be terrific.
p379
aVIt would be a mall, and not a park.
p380
aV(Applause)
p381
aVAnd you know what, it might mean
p382
aVmore money for the city,
p383
aVbut a city has to take the long view,
p384
aVthe view for the common good.
p385
aVMost recently, the last section of the High Line,
p386
aVthe third section of the High Line,
p387
aVthe final section of the High Line,
p388
aVhas been pitted against development interests,
p389
aVwhere some of the city's leading developers
p390
aVare building more than 17 million square feet
p391
aVat the Hudson Yards.
p392
aVAnd they came to me and proposed
p393
aVthat they "temporarily disassemble"
p394
aVthat third and final section.
p395
aVPerhaps the High Line didn't fit in
p396
aVwith their image of a gleaming city of skyscrapers
p397
aVon a hill.
p398
aVPerhaps it was just in their way.
p399
aVBut in any case, it took nine months
p400
aVof nonstop daily negotiation
p401
aVto finally get the signed agreement
p402
aVto prohibit its demolition,
p403
aVand that was only two years ago.
p404
aa(lp405
VSo you see, no matter how popular
p406
aVand successful a public space may be,
p407
aVit can never be taken for granted.
p408
aVPublic spaces always \u2014 this is it saved \u2014
p409
aVpublic spaces always need vigilant champions,
p410
aVnot only to claim them at the outset for public use,
p411
aVbut to design them for the people that use them,
p412
aVthen to maintain them to ensure
p413
aVthat they are for everyone,
p414
aVthat they are not violated, invaded,
p415
aVabandoned or ignored.
p416
aVIf there is any one lesson
p417
aVthat I have learned in my life as a city planner,
p418
aVit is that public spaces have power.
p419
aVIt's not just the number of people using them,
p420
aVit's the even greater number of people
p421
aVwho feel better about their city
p422
aVjust knowing that they are there.
p423
aVPublic space can change how you live in a city,
p424
aVhow you feel about a city,
p425
aVwhether you choose one city over another,
p426
aVand public space is one of the most important reasons
p427
aVwhy you stay in a city.
p428
aa(lp429
VI believe that a successful city
p430
aVis like a fabulous party.
p431
aVPeople stay because they are having a great time.
p432
aa(lp433
VThank you.
