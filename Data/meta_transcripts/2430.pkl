VOn January 26, 2013,
p4
aVa band of al-Qaeda militants entered the ancient city of Timbuktu
p5
aVon the southern edge of the Sahara Desert.
p6
aVThere, they set fire to a medieval library of 30,000 manuscripts
p7
aVwritten in Arabic and several African languages
p8
aVand ranging in subject from astronomy to geography, history to medicine,
p9
aVincluding one book which records
p10
aVperhaps the first treatment for male erectile dysfunction.
p11
aVUnknown in the West,
p12
aVthis was the collected wisdom of an entire continent,
p13
aVthe voice of Africa at a time when Africa was thought not to have a voice at all.
p14
aVThe mayor of Bamako, who witnessed the event,
p15
aVcalled the burning of the manuscripts
p16
aV"a crime against world cultural heritage."
p17
aVAnd he was right \u2014
p18
aVor he would have been, if it weren't for the fact that he was also lying.
p19
aa(lp20
VIn fact, just before,
p21
aVAfrican scholars had collected a random assortment of old books
p22
aVand left them out for the terrorists to burn.
p23
aVToday, the collection lies hidden in Bamako,
p24
aVthe capital of Mali,
p25
aVmoldering in the high humidity.
p26
aVWhat was rescued by ruse
p27
aVis now once again in jeopardy,
p28
aVthis time by climate.
p29
aa(lp30
VBut Africa, and the far-flung corners of the world,
p31
aVare not the only places, or even the main places
p32
aVin which manuscripts that could change the history of world culture
p33
aVare in jeopardy.
p34
aVSeveral years ago, I conducted a survey of European research libraries
p35
aVand discovered that, at the barest minimum,
p36
aVthere are 60,000 manuscripts
p37
aVpre-1500
p38
aVthat are illegible because of water damage,
p39
aVfading, mold and chemical reagents.
p40
aVThe real number is likely double that,
p41
aVand that doesn't even count
p42
aVRenaissance manuscripts and modern manuscripts
p43
aVand cultural heritage objects such as maps.
p44
aa(lp45
VWhat if there were a technology
p46
aVthat could recover these lost and unknown works?
p47
aVImagine worldwide how a trove of hundreds of thousands
p48
aVof previously unknown texts
p49
aVcould radically transform our knowledge of the past.
p50
aVImagine what unknown classics we would discover
p51
aVwhich would rewrite the canons of literature, history,
p52
aVphilosophy, music \u2014
p53
aVor, more provocatively, that could rewrite our cultural identities,
p54
aVbuilding new bridges between people and culture.
p55
aVThese are the questions that transformed me
p56
aVfrom a medieval scholar, a reader of texts,
p57
aVinto a textual scientist.
p58
aa(lp59
VWhat an unsatisfying word "reader" is.
p60
aVFor me, it conjures up images of passivity,
p61
aVof someone sitting idly in an armchair
p62
aVwaiting for knowledge to come to him
p63
aVin a neat little parcel.
p64
aVHow much better to be a participant in the past,
p65
aVan adventurer in an undiscovered country,
p66
aVsearching for the hidden text.
p67
aVAs an academic, I was a mere reader.
p68
aVI read and taught the same classics
p69
aVthat people had been reading and teaching for hundreds of years \u2014
p70
aVVirgil, Ovid, Chaucer, Petrarch \u2014
p71
aVand with every scholarly article that I published
p72
aVI added to human knowledge in ever-diminishing slivers of insight.
p73
aVWhat I wanted to be
p74
aVwas an archaeologist of the past,
p75
aVa discoverer of literature,
p76
aVan Indiana Jones without the whip \u2014
p77
aVor, actually, with the whip.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aVAnd I wanted it not just for myself but I wanted it for my students as well.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd so six years ago, I changed the direction of my career.
p83
aVAt the time, I was working on "The Chess of Love,"
p84
aVthe last important long poem of the European Middle Ages
p85
aVnever to have been edited.
p86
aVAnd it wasn't edited because it existed in only one manuscript
p87
aVwhich was so badly damaged during the firebombing of Dresden
p88
aVin World War II
p89
aVthat generations of scholars had pronounced it lost.
p90
aVFor five years, I had been working with an ultraviolet lamp
p91
aVtrying to recover traces of the writing
p92
aVand I'd gone about as far as technology at the time
p93
aVcould actually take me.
p94
aa(lp95
VAnd so I did what many people do.
p96
aVI went online,
p97
aVand there I learned about
p98
aVhow multispectral imaging had been used to recover two lost treatises
p99
aVof the famed Greek mathematician Archimedes
p100
aVfrom a 13th-century palimpsest.
p101
aVA palimpsest is a manuscript which has been erased and overwritten.
p102
aa(lp103
VAnd so, out of the blue,
p104
aVI decided to write to the lead imaging scientist
p105
aVon the Archimedes palimpsest project,
p106
aVProfessor Roger Easton,
p107
aVwith a plan and a plea.
p108
aVAnd to my surprise, he actually wrote back.
p109
aVWith his help, I was able to win a grant from the US government
p110
aVto build a transportable, multispectral imaging lab,
p111
aVAnd with this lab, I transformed what was a charred and faded mess
p112
aVinto a new medieval classic.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo how does multispectral imaging actually work?
p115
aVWell, the idea behind multispectral imaging
p116
aVis something that anyone who is familiar with infrared night vision goggles
p117
aVwill immediately appreciate:
p118
aVthat what we can see in the visible spectrum of light
p119
aVis only a tiny fraction of what's actually there.
p120
aVThe same is true with invisible writing.
p121
aVOur system uses 12 wavelengths of light
p122
aVbetween the ultraviolet and the infrared,
p123
aVand these are shown down onto the manuscript from above
p124
aVfrom banks of LEDs,
p125
aVand another multispectral light source
p126
aVwhich comes up through the individual leaves of the manuscript.
p127
aVUp to 35 images per sequence per leaf are imaged this way
p128
aVusing a high-powered digital camera equipped with a lens
p129
aVwhich is made out of quartz.
p130
aVThere are about five of these in the world.
p131
aVAnd once we capture these images,
p132
aVwe feed them through statistical algorithms
p133
aVto further enhance and clarify them,
p134
aVusing software which was originally designed for satellite images
p135
aVand used by people like geospatial scientists
p136
aVand the CIA.
p137
aa(lp138
VThe results can be spectacular.
p139
aVYou may already have heard of what's been done
p140
aVfor the Dead Sea Scrolls,
p141
aVwhich are slowly gelatinizing.
p142
aVUsing infrared, we've been able to read even the darkest corners
p143
aVof the Dead Sea Scrolls.
p144
aVYou may not be aware, however,
p145
aVof other Biblical texts that are in jeopardy.
p146
aa(lp147
VHere, for example, is a leaf from a manuscript
p148
aVthat we imaged,
p149
aVwhich is perhaps the most valuable Christian Bible in the world.
p150
aVThe Codex Vercellensis is the oldest translation of the Gospels into Latin,
p151
aVand it dates from the first half of the fourth century.
p152
aVThis is the closest we can come
p153
aVto the Bible at the time of the foundation of Christendom
p154
aVunder Emperor Constantine,
p155
aVand at the time also of the Council of Nicaea,
p156
aVwhen the basic creed of Christianity was being agreed upon.
p157
aVThis manuscript, unfortunately, has been very badly damaged,
p158
aVand it's damaged because for centuries
p159
aVit had been used and handled
p160
aVin swearing in ceremonies in the church.
p161
aVIn fact, that purple splotch that you see in the upper left hand corner
p162
aVis Aspergillus, which is a fungus
p163
aVwhich originates in the unwashed hands
p164
aVof a person with tuberculosis.
p165
aVOur imaging has enabled me to make the first transcription
p166
aVof this manuscript in 250 years.
p167
aa(lp168
VHaving a lab that can travel to collections where it's needed, however,
p169
aVis only part of the solution.
p170
aVThe technology is expensive and very rare,
p171
aVand the imaging and image processing skills are esoteric.
p172
aVThat means that mounting recoveries
p173
aVis beyond the reach of most researchers and all but the wealthiest institutions.
p174
aVThat's why I founded the Lazarus Project,
p175
aVa not-for-profit initiative
p176
aVto bring multispectral imaging to individual researchers
p177
aVand smaller institutions at little or no cost whatsoever.
p178
aVOver the past five years,
p179
aVour team of imaging scientists, scholars and students
p180
aVhas travelled to seven different countries
p181
aVand have recovered some of the world's most valuable damaged manuscripts,
p182
aVincluded the Vercelli Book, which is the oldest book of English,
p183
aVthe Black Book of Carmarthen, the oldest book of Welsh,
p184
aVand some of the most valuable earliest Gospels
p185
aVlocated in what is now the former Soviet Georgia.
p186
aa(lp187
VSo, spectral imaging can recover lost texts.
p188
aVMore subtly, though, it can recover a second story behind every object,
p189
aVthe story of how, when and by whom a text was created,
p190
aVand, sometimes, what the author was thinking at the time he wrote.
p191
aVTake, for example, a draft of the Declaration of Independence
p192
aVwritten in Thomas Jefferson's own hand,
p193
aVwhich some colleagues of mine imaged a few years ago
p194
aVat the Library of Congress.
p195
aVCurators had noticed that one word throughout
p196
aVhad been scratched out and overwritten.
p197
aVThe word overwritten was "citizens."
p198
aVPerhaps you can guess what the word underneath was.
p199
aV"Subjects."
p200
aVThere, ladies and gentlemen, is American democracy
p201
aVevolving under the hand of Thomas Jefferson.
p202
aa(lp203
VOr consider the 1491 Martellus Map,
p204
aVwhich we imaged at Yale's Beinecke Library.
p205
aVThis was the map that Columbus likely consulted
p206
aVbefore he traveled to the New World
p207
aVand which gave him his idea of what Asia looked like
p208
aVand where Japan was located.
p209
aVThe problem with this map is that its inks and pigments
p210
aVhad so degraded over time
p211
aVthat this large, nearly seven-foot map,
p212
aVmade the world look like a giant desert.
p213
aVUntil now, we had very little idea, detailed idea, that is,
p214
aVof what Columbus knew of the world
p215
aVand how world cultures were represented.
p216
aVThe main legend of the map was entirely illegible under normal light.
p217
aVUltraviolet did very little for it.
p218
aVMultispectral gave us everything.
p219
aVIn Asia, we learned of monsters with ears so long
p220
aVthat they could cover the creature's entire body.
p221
aVIn Africa, about a snake who could cause the ground to smoke.
p222
aVLike starlight, which can convey images
p223
aVof the way the Universe looked in the distant past,
p224
aVso multispectral light can take us back to the first stuttering moments
p225
aVof an object's creation.
p226
aVThrough this lens, we witness the mistakes, the changes of mind,
p227
aVthe naïvetés, the uncensored thoughts,
p228
aVthe imperfections of the human imagination
p229
aVthat allow these hallowed objects and their authors
p230
aVto become more real,
p231
aVthat make history closer to us.
p232
aa(lp233
VWhat about the future?
p234
aVThere's so much of the past,
p235
aVand so few people with the skills to rescue it
p236
aVbefore these objects disappear forever.
p237
aVThat's why I have begun to teach this new hybrid discipline
p238
aVthat I call "textual science."
p239
aVTextual science is a marriage
p240
aVof the traditional skills of a literary scholar \u2014
p241
aVthe ability to read old languages and old handwriting,
p242
aVthe knowledge of how texts are made
p243
aVin order to be able to place and date them \u2014
p244
aVwith new techniques like imaging science,
p245
aVthe chemistry of inks and pigments,
p246
aVcomputer-aided optical character recognition.
p247
aa(lp248
VLast year, a student in my class,
p249
aVa freshman,
p250
aVwith a background in Latin and Greek,
p251
aVwas image-processing a palimpsest
p252
aVthat we had photographed at a famous library in Rome.
p253
aVAs he worked, tiny Greek writing began to appear from behind the text.
p254
aVEveryone gathered around,
p255
aVand he read a line from a lost work
p256
aVof the Greek comic dramatist Menander.
p257
aVThis was the first time in well over a thousand years
p258
aVthat those words had been pronounced aloud.
p259
aVIn that moment, he became a scholar.
p260
aa(lp261
VLadies and gentlemen, that is the future of the past.
p262
aa(lp263
VThank you very much.
