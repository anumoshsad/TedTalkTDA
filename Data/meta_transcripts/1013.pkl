VI woke up in the middle of the night
p4
aVwith the sound of heavy explosion.
p5
aVIt was deep at night.
p6
aVI do not remember what time it was.
p7
aVI just remember the sound
p8
aVwas so heavy
p9
aVand so very shocking.
p10
aVEverything in my room was shaking \u2014
p11
aVmy heart, my windows,
p12
aVmy bed, everything.
p13
aVI looked out the windows
p14
aVand I saw a full half-circle
p15
aVof explosion.
p16
aVI thought it was just like the movies,
p17
aVbut the movies had not conveyed them
p18
aVin the powerful image that I was seeing
p19
aVfull of bright red
p20
aVand orange and gray,
p21
aVand a full circle of explosion.
p22
aVAnd I kept on staring at it
p23
aVuntil it disappeared.
p24
aVI went back to my bed,
p25
aVand I prayed,
p26
aVand I secretly thanked God
p27
aVthat that missile
p28
aVdid not land on my family's home,
p29
aVthat it did not kill my family that night.
p30
aVThirty years have passed,
p31
aVand I still feel guilty about that prayer,
p32
aVfor the next day, I learned that that missile
p33
aVlanded on my brother's friend's home
p34
aVand killed him
p35
aVand his father,
p36
aVbut did not kill his mother or his sister.
p37
aVHis mother showed up the next week
p38
aVat my brother's classroom
p39
aVand begged seven-year-old kids
p40
aVto share with her any picture they may have
p41
aVof her son,
p42
aVfor she had lost everything.
p43
aa(lp44
VThis is not a story
p45
aVof a nameless survivor of war,
p46
aVand nameless refugees,
p47
aVwhose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers
p48
aVand our TV
p49
aVwith tattered clothes,
p50
aVdirty face, scared eyes.
p51
aVThis is not a story of a nameless someone
p52
aVwho lived in some war,
p53
aVwho we do not know their hopes, their dreams,
p54
aVtheir accomplishments, their families,
p55
aVtheir beliefs, their values.
p56
aVThis is my story.
p57
aVI was that girl.
p58
aVI am another image and vision
p59
aVof another survivor of war.
p60
aVI am that refugee,
p61
aVand I am that girl.
p62
aVYou see,
p63
aVI grew up in war-torn Iraq,
p64
aVand I believe that there are two sides of wars
p65
aVand we've only seen
p66
aVone side of it.
p67
aVWe only talk about
p68
aVone side of it.
p69
aVBut there's another side
p70
aVthat I have witnessed
p71
aVas someone who lived in it
p72
aVand someone who ended up working in it.
p73
aa(lp74
VI grew up with the colors of war \u2014
p75
aVthe red colors of fire and blood,
p76
aVthe brown tones of earth
p77
aVas it explodes
p78
aVin our faces
p79
aVand the piercing silver
p80
aVof an exploded missile,
p81
aVso bright
p82
aVthat nothing can protect your eyes from it.
p83
aVI grew up
p84
aVwith the sounds of war \u2014
p85
aVthe staccato sounds of gunfire,
p86
aVthe wrenching booms of explosions,
p87
aVominous drones of jets flying overhead
p88
aVand the wailing warning sounds
p89
aVof sirens.
p90
aVThese are the sounds you would expect,
p91
aVbut they are also the sounds
p92
aVof dissonant concerts of a flock of birds
p93
aVscreeching in the night,
p94
aVthe high-pitched honest cries
p95
aVof children
p96
aVand the thunderous,
p97
aVunbearable
p98
aVsilence.
p99
aV"War," a friend of mine said,
p100
aV"is not about sound at all.
p101
aVIt is actually about silence,
p102
aVthe silence of humanity."
p103
aa(lp104
VI have since left Iraq
p105
aVand founded a group called Women for Women International
p106
aVthat ends up working
p107
aVwith women survivors of wars.
p108
aVIn my travels and in my work,
p109
aVfrom Congo to Afghanistan,
p110
aVfrom Sudan to Rwanda,
p111
aVI have learned not only
p112
aVthat the colors and the sounds of war are the same,
p113
aVbut the fears of war are the same.
p114
aVYou know, there is a fear of dying,
p115
aVand do not believe any movie character
p116
aVwhere the hero is not afraid.
p117
aVIt is very scary
p118
aVto go through that feeling
p119
aVof "I am about to die"
p120
aVor "I could die in this explosion."
p121
aVBut there's also the fear
p122
aVof losing loved ones,
p123
aVand I think that's even worse.
p124
aVIt's too painful. You don't want to think about it.
p125
aVBut I think the worst kind of fear is the fear \u2014
p126
aVas Samia, a Bosnian woman, once told me,
p127
aVwho survived the four-years besiege of Sarajevo;
p128
aVshe said, "The fear
p129
aVof losing
p130
aVthe 'I' in me,
p131
aVthe fear of losing
p132
aVthe 'I' in me."
p133
aVThat's what my mother in Iraq
p134
aVused to tell me.
p135
aVIt's like dying from inside-out.
p136
aVA Palestinian woman once told me,
p137
aV"It is not about the fear of one death,"
p138
aVshe said, "sometimes I feel
p139
aVI die 10 times in one day,"
p140
aVas she was describing the marches of soldiers
p141
aVand the sounds of their bullets.
p142
aVShe said, "But it's not fair,
p143
aVbecause there is only one life,
p144
aVand there should only be one death."
p145
aa(lp146
VWe have been only seeing
p147
aVone side of war.
p148
aVWe have only been discussing and consumed
p149
aVwith high-level preoccupations
p150
aVover troop levels, drawdown timelines,
p151
aVsurges and sting operations,
p152
aVwhen we should be examining the details
p153
aVof where the social fabric
p154
aVhas been most torn,
p155
aVwhere the community has improvised
p156
aVand survived
p157
aVand shown acts of resilience
p158
aVand amazing courage
p159
aVjust to keep life going.
p160
aVWe have been so consumed
p161
aVwith seemingly objective discussions
p162
aVof politics, tactics,
p163
aVweapons, dollars
p164
aVand casualties.
p165
aVThis is the language
p166
aVof sterility.
p167
aa(lp168
VHow casually
p169
aVwe treat casualties
p170
aVin the context of this topic.
p171
aVThis is where we conceive of rape and casualties
p172
aVas inevitabilities.
p173
aVEighty percent of refugees around the world
p174
aVare women and children. Oh.
p175
aVNinety percent of modern war casualties
p176
aVare civilians.
p177
aVSeventy-five percent of them are women and children.
p178
aVHow interesting.
p179
aVOh, half a million women in Rwanda
p180
aVget raped in 100 days.
p181
aVOr, as we speak now,
p182
aVhundreds of thousands of Congolese women
p183
aVare getting raped and mutilated.
p184
aVHow interesting.
p185
aVThese just become numbers that we refer to.
p186
aVThe front of wars
p187
aVis increasingly non-human eyes
p188
aVpeering down on our perceived enemies
p189
aVfrom space,
p190
aVguiding missiles toward unseen targets,
p191
aVwhile the human conduct
p192
aVof the orchestra of media relations
p193
aVin the event that this particular drone attack
p194
aVhits a villager
p195
aVinstead of an extremist.
p196
aVIt is a chess game.
p197
aVYou learn to play an international relations school
p198
aVon your way out and up
p199
aVto national and international leadership.
p200
aVCheckmate.
p201
aa(lp202
VWe are missing
p203
aVa completely other side of wars.
p204
aVWe are missing my mother's story,
p205
aVwho made sure with every siren, with every raid,
p206
aVwith every cut off-of electricity,
p207
aVshe played puppet shows for my brothers and I,
p208
aVso we would not be scared
p209
aVof the sounds of explosions.
p210
aVWe are missing the story of Fareeda,
p211
aVa music teacher,
p212
aVa piano teacher, in Sarajevo,
p213
aVwho made sure
p214
aVthat she kept the music school open
p215
aVevery single day
p216
aVin the four years of besiege in Sarajevo
p217
aVand walked to that school,
p218
aVdespite the snipers shooting
p219
aVat that school and at her,
p220
aVand kept the piano, the violin, the cello
p221
aVplaying the whole duration of the war,
p222
aVwith students wearing their gloves and hats and coats.
p223
aVThat was her fight.
p224
aVThat was her resistance.
p225
aVWe are missing the story of Nehia,
p226
aVa Palestinian woman in Gaza
p227
aVwho, the minute there was a cease-fire in the last year's war,
p228
aVshe left out of home,
p229
aVcollected all the flour
p230
aVand baked as much bread for every neighbor to have,
p231
aVin case there is no cease-fire the day after.
p232
aVWe are missing
p233
aVthe stories of Violet,
p234
aVwho, despite surviving genocide in the church massacre,
p235
aVshe kept on going on,
p236
aVburying bodies, cleaning homes, cleaning the streets.
p237
aVWe are missing stories of women
p238
aVwho are literally keeping life going
p239
aVin the midst of wars.
p240
aVDo you know \u2014
p241
aVdo you know that people fall in love in war
p242
aVand go to school
p243
aVand go to factories and hospitals
p244
aVand get divorced and go dancing and go playing
p245
aVand live life going?
p246
aVAnd the ones who are keeping that life
p247
aVare women.
p248
aa(lp249
VThere are two sides of war.
p250
aVThere is a side that fights,
p251
aVand there is a side that keeps the schools
p252
aVand the factories and the hospitals open.
p253
aVThere is a side that is focused on winning battles,
p254
aVand there is a side that is focused
p255
aVon winning life.
p256
aVThere is a side that leads the front-line discussion,
p257
aVand there is a side
p258
aVthat leads the back-line discussion.
p259
aVThere is a side that thinks
p260
aVthat peace is the end of fighting,
p261
aVand there is a side that thinks
p262
aVthat peace is the arrival
p263
aVof schools and jobs.
p264
aVThere is a side
p265
aVthat is led by men,
p266
aVand there is a side
p267
aVthat is led by women.
p268
aVAnd in order for us to understand
p269
aVhow do we build lasting peace,
p270
aVwe must understand war and peace
p271
aVfrom both sides.
p272
aVWe must have a full picture
p273
aVof what that means.
p274
aa(lp275
VIn order for us to understand
p276
aVwhat actually peace means,
p277
aVwe need to understand,
p278
aVas one Sudanese woman once told me,
p279
aV"Peace is the fact that my toenails
p280
aVare growing back again."
p281
aVShe grew up in Sudan, in Southern Sudan,
p282
aVfor 20 years of war,
p283
aVwhere it killed one million people
p284
aVand displaced five million refugees.
p285
aVMany women were taken as slaves
p286
aVby rebels and soldiers,
p287
aVas sexual slaves who were forced also
p288
aVto carry the ammunition and the water
p289
aVand the food for the soldiers.
p290
aVSo that woman walked for 20 years,
p291
aVso she would not be kidnapped again.
p292
aVAnd only when there was some sort of peace,
p293
aVher toenails grew back again.
p294
aVWe need to understand peace
p295
aVfrom a toenail's perspective.
p296
aa(lp297
VWe need to understand
p298
aVthat we cannot actually have negotiations
p299
aVof ending of wars or peace
p300
aVwithout fully including women
p301
aVat the negotiating table.
p302
aVI find it amazing
p303
aVthat the only group of people
p304
aVwho are not fighting and not killing
p305
aVand not pillaging and not burning and not raping,
p306
aVand the group of people who are mostly \u2014
p307
aVthough not exclusively \u2014
p308
aVwho are keeping life going in the midst of war,
p309
aVare not included in the negotiating table.
p310
aVAnd I do argue that women lead the back-line discussion,
p311
aVbut there are also men
p312
aVwho are excluded from that discussion.
p313
aVThe doctors who are not fighting,
p314
aVthe artists, the students, the men who refuse to pick up the guns,
p315
aVthey are, too, excluded
p316
aVfrom the negotiating tables.
p317
aVThere is no way we can talk about a lasting peace,
p318
aVbuilding of democracy, sustainable economies,
p319
aVany kind of stabilities,
p320
aVif we do not fully include women
p321
aVat the negotiating table.
p322
aVNot one, but 50 percent.
p323
aa(lp324
VThere is no way we can talk about the building of stability
p325
aVif we don't start investing
p326
aVin women and girls.
p327
aVDid you know
p328
aVthat one year
p329
aVof the world's military spending
p330
aVequals 700 years
p331
aVof the U.N. budget
p332
aVand equals 2,928 years
p333
aVof the U.N. budget allocated for women?
p334
aVIf we just reverse
p335
aVthat distribution of funds,
p336
aVperhaps we could have
p337
aVa better lasting peace in this world.
p338
aVAnd last, but not least,
p339
aVwe need to invest in peace and women,
p340
aVnot only because it is the right thing to do,
p341
aVnot only because it is the right thing to do,
p342
aVfor all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today,
p343
aVbut it is for the future.
p344
aa(lp345
VA Congolese woman,
p346
aVwho was telling me about
p347
aVhow her children saw their father killed in front of them
p348
aVand saw her raped in front of them
p349
aVand mutilated in front of them,
p350
aVand her children saw their nine-year-old sibling
p351
aVkilled in front of them,
p352
aVhow they're doing okay right now.
p353
aVShe got into Women for Women International's program.
p354
aVShe got a support network.
p355
aVShe learned about her rights.
p356
aVWe taught her vocational and business skills. We helped her get a job.
p357
aVShe was earning 450 dollars. She was doing okay.
p358
aVShe was sending them to school. Have a new home.
p359
aVShe said, "But what I worry about the most
p360
aVis not any of that.
p361
aVI worry that my children
p362
aVhave hate in their hearts,
p363
aVand when they want to grow up, they want to fight again
p364
aVthe killers of their father and their brother."
p365
aVWe need to invest in women,
p366
aVbecause that's our only chance
p367
aVto ensure that there is no more war
p368
aVin the future.
p369
aVThat mother has a better chance to heal her children
p370
aVthan any peace agreement can do.
p371
aa(lp372
VAre there good news? Of course, there are good news. There are lots of good news.
p373
aVTo start with, these women that I told you about
p374
aVare dancing and singing every single day,
p375
aVand if they can,
p376
aVwho are we not to dance?
p377
aVThat girl that I told you about
p378
aVended up starting Women for Women International Group
p379
aVthat impacted one million people, sent 80 million dollars,
p380
aVand I started this from zero,
p381
aVnothing, nada, [unclear].
p382
aa(lp383
V(Laughter)
p384
aa(lp385
VThey are women who are standing on their feet
p386
aVin spite of their circumstances,
p387
aVnot because of it.
p388
aVThink of how the world can be a much better place
p389
aVif, for a change,
p390
aVwe have a better equality,
p391
aVwe have equality,
p392
aVwe have a representation
p393
aVand we understand war,
p394
aVboth from the front-line
p395
aVand the back-line discussion.
p396
aa(lp397
VRumi, a 13th-century Sufi poet,
p398
aVsays, "Out beyond the worlds
p399
aVof right-doings and wrong-doings,
p400
aVthere is a field.
p401
aVI will meet you there.
p402
aVWhen the soul lies down in that grass,
p403
aVthe world is too full
p404
aVto talk about.
p405
aVIdeas, language,
p406
aVeven the phrase 'each other'
p407
aVno longer makes any sense."
p408
aVI humbly add \u2014 humbly add \u2014
p409
aVthat out beyond
p410
aVthe worlds of war and peace,
