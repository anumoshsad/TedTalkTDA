VCancer affects all of us \u2014
p4
aVespecially the ones that come back over and over again,
p5
aVthe highly invasive and drug-resistant ones,
p6
aVthe ones that defy medical treatment,
p7
aVeven when we throw our best drugs at them.
p8
aVEngineering at the molecular level,
p9
aVworking at the smallest of scales,
p10
aVcan provide exciting new ways
p11
aVto fight the most aggressive forms of cancer.
p12
aa(lp13
VCancer is a very clever disease.
p14
aVThere are some forms of cancer,
p15
aVwhich, fortunately, we've learned how to address relatively well
p16
aVwith known and established drugs and surgery.
p17
aVBut there are some forms of cancer
p18
aVthat don't respond to these approaches,
p19
aVand the tumor survives or comes back,
p20
aVeven after an onslaught of drugs.
p21
aa(lp22
VWe can think of these very aggressive forms of cancer
p23
aVas kind of supervillains in a comic book.
p24
aVThey're clever, they're adaptable,
p25
aVand they're very good at staying alive.
p26
aVAnd, like most supervillains these days,
p27
aVtheir superpowers come from a genetic mutation.
p28
aVThe genes that are modified inside these tumor cells
p29
aVcan enable and encode for new and unimagined modes of survival,
p30
aVallowing the cancer cell to live through
p31
aVeven our best chemotherapy treatments.
p32
aa(lp33
VOne example is a trick in which a gene allows a cell,
p34
aVeven as the drug approaches the cell,
p35
aVto push the drug out,
p36
aVbefore the drug can have any effect.
p37
aVImagine \u2014 the cell effectively spits out the drug.
p38
aVThis is just one example of the many genetic tricks
p39
aVin the bag of our supervillain, cancer.
p40
aVAll due to mutant genes.
p41
aa(lp42
VSo, we have a supervillain with incredible superpowers.
p43
aVAnd we need a new and powerful mode of attack.
p44
aVActually, we can turn off a gene.
p45
aVThe key is a set of molecules known as siRNA.
p46
aVsiRNA are short sequences of genetic code
p47
aVthat guide a cell to block a certain gene.
p48
aVEach siRNA molecule can turn off a specific gene
p49
aVinside the cell.
p50
aVFor many years since its discovery,
p51
aVscientists have been very excited
p52
aVabout how we can apply these gene blockers in medicine.
p53
aa(lp54
VBut, there is a problem.
p55
aVsiRNA works well inside the cell.
p56
aVBut if it gets exposed to the enzymes
p57
aVthat reside in our bloodstream or our tissues,
p58
aVit degrades within seconds.
p59
aVIt has to be packaged, protected through its journey through the body
p60
aVon its way to the final target inside the cancer cell.
p61
aa(lp62
VSo, here's our strategy.
p63
aVFirst, we'll dose the cancer cell with siRNA, the gene blocker,
p64
aVand silence those survival genes,
p65
aVand then we'll whop it with a chemo drug.
p66
aVBut how do we carry that out?
p67
aVUsing molecular engineering,
p68
aVwe can actually design a superweapon
p69
aVthat can travel through the bloodstream.
p70
aVIt has to be tiny enough to get through the bloodstream,
p71
aVit's got to be small enough to penetrate the tumor tissue,
p72
aVand it's got to be tiny enough to be taken up inside the cancer cell.
p73
aVTo do this job well,
p74
aVit has to be about one one-hundredth the size of a human hair.
p75
aa(lp76
VLet's take a closer look at how we can build this nanoparticle.
p77
aVFirst, let's start with the nanoparticle core.
p78
aVIt's a tiny capsule that contains the chemotherapy drug.
p79
aVThis is the poison that will actually end the tumor cell's life.
p80
aVAround this core, we'll wrap a very thin,
p81
aVnanometers-thin blanket of siRNA.
p82
aVThis is our gene blocker.
p83
aVBecause siRNA is strongly negatively charged,
p84
aVwe can protect it
p85
aVwith a nice, protective layer of positively charged polymer.
p86
aVThe two oppositely charged molecules stick together
p87
aVthrough charge attraction,
p88
aVand that provides us with a protective layer
p89
aVthat prevents the siRNA from degrading in the bloodstream.
p90
aVWe're almost done.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VBut there is one more big obstacle we have to think about.
p95
aVIn fact, it may be the biggest obstacle of all.
p96
aVHow do we deploy this superweapon?
p97
aVI mean, every good weapon needs to be targeted,
p98
aVwe have to target this superweapon to the supervillain cells
p99
aVthat reside in the tumor.
p100
aa(lp101
VBut our bodies have a natural immune-defense system:
p102
aVcells that reside in the bloodstream
p103
aVand pick out things that don't belong,
p104
aVso that it can destroy or eliminate them.
p105
aVAnd guess what? Our nanoparticle is considered a foreign object.
p106
aVWe have to sneak our nanoparticle past the tumor defense system.
p107
aVWe have to get it past this mechanism of getting rid of the foreign object
p108
aVby disguising it.
p109
aa(lp110
VSo we add one more negatively charged layer
p111
aVaround this nanoparticle,
p112
aVwhich serves two purposes.
p113
aVFirst, this outer layer is one of the naturally charged,
p114
aVhighly hydrated polysaccharides that resides in our body.
p115
aVIt creates a cloud of water molecules around the nanoparticle
p116
aVthat gives us an invisibility cloaking effect.
p117
aVThis invisibility cloak allows the nanoparticle
p118
aVto travel through the bloodstream
p119
aVlong and far enough to reach the tumor,
p120
aVwithout getting eliminated by the body.
p121
aa(lp122
VSecond, this layer contains molecules
p123
aVwhich bind specifically to our tumor cell.
p124
aVOnce bound, the cancer cell takes up the nanoparticle,
p125
aVand now we have our nanoparticle inside the cancer cell
p126
aVand ready to deploy.
p127
aa(lp128
VAlright! I feel the same way. Let's go!
p129
aa(lp130
V(Applause)
p131
aa(lp132
VThe siRNA is deployed first.
p133
aVIt acts for hours,
p134
aVgiving enough time to silence and block those survival genes.
p135
aVWe have now disabled those genetic superpowers.
p136
aVWhat remains is a cancer cell with no special defenses.
p137
aVThen, the chemotherapy drug comes out of the core
p138
aVand destroys the tumor cell cleanly and efficiently.
p139
aVWith sufficient gene blockers,
p140
aVwe can address many different kinds of mutations,
p141
aVallowing the chance to sweep out tumors,
p142
aVwithout leaving behind any bad guys.
p143
aa(lp144
VSo, how does our strategy work?
p145
aVWe've tested these nanostructure particles in animals
p146
aVusing a highly aggressive form of triple-negative breast cancer.
p147
aVThis triple-negative breast cancer exhibits the gene
p148
aVthat spits out cancer drug as soon as it is delivered.
p149
aa(lp150
VUsually, doxorubicin \u2014 let's call it "dox" \u2014 is the cancer drug
p151
aVthat is the first line of treatment for breast cancer.
p152
aVSo, we first treated our animals with a dox core, dox only.
p153
aVThe tumor slowed their rate of growth,
p154
aVbut they still grew rapidly,
p155
aVdoubling in size over a period of two weeks.
p156
aa(lp157
VThen, we tried our combination superweapon.
p158
aVA nanolayer particle with siRNA against the chemo pump,
p159
aVplus, we have the dox in the core.
p160
aVAnd look \u2014 we found that not only did the tumors stop growing,
p161
aVthey actually decreased in size
p162
aVand were eliminated in some cases.
p163
aVThe tumors were actually regressing.
p164
aa(lp165
V(Applause)
p166
aa(lp167
VWhat's great about this approach is that it can be personalized.
p168
aVWe can add many different layers of siRNA
p169
aVto address different mutations and tumor defense mechanisms.
p170
aVAnd we can put different drugs into the nanoparticle core.
p171
aVAs doctors learn how to test patients
p172
aVand understand certain tumor genetic types,
p173
aVthey can help us determine which patients can benefit from this strategy
p174
aVand which gene blockers we can use.
p175
aa(lp176
VOvarian cancer strikes a special chord with me.
p177
aVIt is a very aggressive cancer,
p178
aVin part because it's discovered at very late stages,
p179
aVwhen it's highly advanced
p180
aVand there are a number of genetic mutations.
p181
aVAfter the first round of chemotherapy,
p182
aVthis cancer comes back for 75 percent of patients.
p183
aVAnd it usually comes back in a drug-resistant form.
p184
aVHigh-grade ovarian cancer
p185
aVis one of the biggest supervillains out there.
p186
aVAnd we're now directing our superweapon
p187
aVtoward its defeat.
p188
aa(lp189
VAs a researcher,
p190
aVI usually don't get to work with patients.
p191
aVBut I recently met a mother
p192
aVwho is an ovarian cancer survivor, Mimi, and her daughter, Paige.
p193
aVI was deeply inspired by the optimism and strength
p194
aVthat both mother and daughter displayed
p195
aVand by their story of courage and support.
p196
aVAt this event, we spoke about the different technologies
p197
aVdirected at cancer.
p198
aVAnd Mimi was in tears
p199
aVas she explained how learning about these efforts
p200
aVgives her hope for future generations,
p201
aVincluding her own daughter.
p202
aVThis really touched me.
p203
aVIt's not just about building really elegant science.
p204
aVIt's about changing people's lives.
p205
aVIt's about understanding the power of engineering
p206
aVon the scale of molecules.
p207
aa(lp208
VI know that as students like Paige move forward in their careers,
p209
aVthey'll open new possibilities
p210
aVin addressing some of the big health problems in the world \u2014
p211
aVincluding ovarian cancer, neurological disorders, infectious disease \u2014
p212
aVjust as chemical engineering has found a way to open doors for me,
p213
aVand has provided a way of engineering
p214
aVon the tiniest scale, that of molecules,
p215
aVto heal on the human scale.
p216
