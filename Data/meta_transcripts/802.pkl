VIllegal wildlife trade in Brazil
p4
aVis one of the major threats against our fauna,
p5
aVespecially birds,
p6
aVand mainly to supply the pet market
p7
aVwith thousands of animals taken from nature every month,
p8
aVand transported far from their origins,
p9
aVto be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.
p10
aa(lp11
VIt is estimated that
p12
aVall kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil
p13
aVwithdraw from nature
p14
aValmost 38 million animals every year,
p15
aVa business worth almost two billion dollars.
p16
aVThe police intercepts
p17
aVthese huge cargos with live animals,
p18
aVintended to supply the pet market,
p19
aVor they seize the animals directly from the people's houses,
p20
aVand this is how we end up, every month,
p21
aVwith thousands of seized animals.
p22
aa(lp23
VAnd for us to understand what happens with them,
p24
aVwe're going to follow Brad.
p25
aVIn the eyes of many people,
p26
aVafter the animals are seized,
p27
aVthey say, "Yay, justice has been served.
p28
aVThe good guys arrived,
p29
aVtook the cute, mistreated animals
p30
aVfrom the hands of the evil traffickers,
p31
aVand everyone lived happily ever after."
p32
aVBut did they? Actually, no,
p33
aVand this is where many of our problems begin.
p34
aVBecause we have to figure out
p35
aVwhat to do with all these animals.
p36
aa(lp37
VIn Brazil, they are usually first sent
p38
aVto governmental triage facilities,
p39
aVin which most of the cases,
p40
aVthe conditions are as bad as
p41
aVwith the traffickers.
p42
aVIn 2002, these centers received
p43
aV45,000 animals,
p44
aVof which 37,000 were birds.
p45
aVAnd the police estimates that we seize
p46
aVonly five percent of what's being trafficked.
p47
aVSome lucky ones \u2014 and among them, Brad \u2014
p48
aVgo to serious rehabilitation centers after that.
p49
aVAnd in these places they are cared for.
p50
aVThey train their flying,
p51
aVthey learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature,
p52
aVand they are able to socialize
p53
aVwith others from the same species.
p54
aV(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VBut then what?
p57
aVThe Brazil Ornithological Society \u2014
p58
aVso now we're talking only birds \u2014
p59
aVclaims that we have too little knowledge
p60
aVabout the species in nature.
p61
aVTherefore, it would be too risky
p62
aVto release these animals,
p63
aVboth for the released and for the natural populations.
p64
aVThey also claim that we spend too many resources
p65
aVin their rehabilitation.
p66
aVFollowing this argument,
p67
aVthey suggest that all the birds
p68
aVseized from non-threatened species
p69
aVshould be euthanized.
p70
aVHowever, this would mean having killed
p71
aV26,267 birds,
p72
aVonly in the state of São Paulo, only in 2006.
p73
aa(lp74
VBut, some researchers, myself included \u2014
p75
aVsome NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government \u2014
p76
aVbelieve there is an alternative.
p77
aVWe think that if and when the animals meet
p78
aVcertain criteria concerning their health,
p79
aVbehavior, inferred origin
p80
aVand whatever we know about the natural populations,
p81
aVthen technically responsible releases are possible,
p82
aVboth for the well-being of the individual,
p83
aVand for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems,
p84
aVbecause we will be returning genes for these populations \u2014
p85
aVwhich could be important for them
p86
aVin facing environmental challenges \u2014
p87
aVand also we could be returning
p88
aVpotential seed dispersers, predators, preys, etc.
p89
aa(lp90
VAll of these were released by us.
p91
aVOn the top, the turtles are just enjoying freedom.
p92
aV(Laughter)
p93
aVOn the middle,
p94
aVthis guy nested a couple of weeks after the release.
p95
aVAnd on the bottom, my personal favorite,
p96
aVthe little male over there,
p97
aVfour hours after his release
p98
aVhe was together with a wild female.
p99
aVSo, this is not new, people have been
p100
aVdoing this around the world.
p101
aVBut it's still a big issue in Brazil.
p102
aVWe believe we have performed
p103
aVresponsible releases.
p104
aVWe've registered released animals mating in nature
p105
aVand having chicks.
p106
aVSo, these genes are indeed going back to the populations.
p107
aa(lp108
VHowever this is still a minority
p109
aVfor the very lack of knowledge.
p110
aVSo, I say, "Let's study more, let's shed light on this issue,
p111
aVlet's do whatever we can."
p112
aVI'm devoting my career to that.
p113
aVAnd I'm here to urge each and every one of you
p114
aVto do whatever is in your reach:
p115
aVTalk to your neighbor, teach your children,
p116
aVmake sure your pet is from a legal breeder.
p117
aVWe need to act, and act now,
p118
aVbefore these ones are the only ones left.
p119
aVThank you very much.
