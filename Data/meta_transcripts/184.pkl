VWell, as Chris pointed out, I study the human brain,
p4
aVthe functions and structure of the human brain.
p5
aVAnd I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails.
p6
aVHere is this mass of jelly, three-pound mass of jelly
p7
aVyou can hold in the palm of your hand,
p8
aVand it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.
p9
aVIt can contemplate the meaning of infinity
p10
aVand it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity.
p11
aVAnd this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness,
p12
aVwhich I think is the holy grail of neuroscience, of neurology,
p13
aVand hopefully, someday, we'll understand how that happens.
p14
aa(lp15
VOK, so how do you study this mysterious organ?
p16
aVI mean, you have 100 billion nerve cells,
p17
aVlittle wisps of protoplasm, interacting with each other,
p18
aVand from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities
p19
aVthat we call human nature and human consciousness.
p20
aVHow does this happen?
p21
aVWell, there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain.
p22
aVOne approach, the one we use mainly,
p23
aVis to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain,
p24
aVwhere there's been a genetic change in a small region of the brain.
p25
aVWhat then happens is not an across-the-board reduction
p26
aVin all your mental capacities,
p27
aVa sort of blunting of your cognitive ability.
p28
aVWhat you get is a highly selective loss of one function,
p29
aVwith other functions being preserved intact,
p30
aVand this gives you some confidence in asserting
p31
aVthat that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function.
p32
aVSo you can then map function onto structure,
p33
aVand then find out what the circuitry's doing
p34
aVto generate that particular function.
p35
aVSo that's what we're trying to do.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo let me give you a few striking examples of this.
p38
aVIn fact, I'm giving you three examples, six minutes each, during this talk.
p39
aVThe first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome.
p40
aVIf you look at the first slide there,
p41
aVthat's the temporal lobes, frontal lobes, parietal lobes, OK \u2014
p42
aVthe lobes that constitute the brain.
p43
aVAnd if you look, tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes \u2014
p44
aVyou can't see it there \u2014
p45
aVis a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.
p46
aVAnd that's been called the face area in the brain,
p47
aVbecause when it's damaged, you can no longer recognize people's faces.
p48
aVYou can still recognize them from their voice
p49
aVand say, "Oh yeah, that's Joe,"
p50
aVbut you can't look at their face and know who it is, right?
p51
aVYou can't even recognize yourself in the mirror.
p52
aVI mean, you know it's you because you wink and it winks,
p53
aVand you know it's a mirror,
p54
aVbut you don't really recognize yourself as yourself.
p55
aa(lp56
VOK. Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus.
p57
aVBut there's another rare syndrome, so rare, in fact,
p58
aVthat very few physicians have heard about it, not even neurologists.
p59
aVThis is called the Capgras delusion,
p60
aVand that is a patient, who's otherwise completely normal,
p61
aVhas had a head injury, comes out of coma,
p62
aVotherwise completely normal, he looks at his mother
p63
aVand says, "This looks exactly like my mother, this woman,
p64
aVbut she's an impostor.
p65
aVShe's some other woman pretending to be my mother."
p66
aVNow, why does this happen?
p67
aVWhy would somebody \u2014 and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent
p68
aVin all other respects, but when he sees his mother,
p69
aVhis delusion kicks in and says, it's not mother.
p70
aa(lp71
VNow, the most common interpretation of this,
p72
aVwhich you find in all the psychiatry textbooks,
p73
aVis a Freudian view, and that is that this chap \u2014
p74
aVand the same argument applies to women, by the way,
p75
aVbut I'll just talk about guys.
p76
aVWhen you're a little baby, a young baby,
p77
aVyou had a strong sexual attraction to your mother.
p78
aVThis is the so-called Oedipus complex of Freud.
p79
aVI'm not saying I believe this,
p80
aVbut this is the standard Freudian view.
p81
aVAnd then, as you grow up, the cortex develops,
p82
aVand inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother.
p83
aVThank God, or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother.
p84
aVAnd then what happens is,
p85
aVthere's a blow to your head, damaging the cortex,
p86
aVallowing these latent sexual urges to emerge,
p87
aVflaming to the surface, and suddenly and inexplicably
p88
aVyou find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother.
p89
aVAnd you say, "My God, if this is my mom,
p90
aVhow come I'm being sexually turned on?
p91
aVShe's some other woman. She's an impostor."
p92
aVIt's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain.
p93
aa(lp94
VThis has never made much sense to me, this argument.
p95
aVIt's very ingenious, as all Freudian arguments are \u2014
p96
aV(Laughter)
p97
aV\u2014 but didn't make much sense because I have seen the same delusion,
p98
aVa patient having the same delusion, about his pet poodle.
p99
aV(Laughter)
p100
aVHe'll say, "Doctor, this is not Fifi. It looks exactly like Fifi,
p101
aVbut it's some other dog." Right?
p102
aVNow, you try using the Freudian explanation there.
p103
aV(Laughter)
p104
aVYou'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans,
p105
aVor some such thing, which is quite absurd, of course.
p106
aa(lp107
VNow, what's really going on?
p108
aVSo, to explain this curious disorder,
p109
aVwe look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain.
p110
aVNormally, visual signals come in, into the eyeballs,
p111
aVgo to the visual areas in the brain.
p112
aVThere are, in fact, 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision,
p113
aVand after processing all that, the message goes to a small structure
p114
aVcalled the fusiform gyrus, where you perceive faces.
p115
aVThere are neurons there that are sensitive to faces.
p116
aVYou can call it the face area of the brain, right?
p117
aVI talked about that earlier.
p118
aVNow, when that area's damaged, you lose the ability to see faces, right?
p119
aa(lp120
VBut from that area, the message cascades
p121
aVinto a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system,
p122
aVthe emotional core of the brain,
p123
aVand that structure, called the amygdala,
p124
aVgauges the emotional significance of what you're looking at.
p125
aVIs it prey? Is it predator? Is it mate?
p126
aVOr is it something absolutely trivial, like a piece of lint,
p127
aVor a piece of chalk, or a \u2014 I don't want to point to that, but \u2014
p128
aVor a shoe, or something like that? OK?
p129
aVWhich you can completely ignore.
p130
aVSo if the amygdala is excited, and this is something important,
p131
aVthe messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system.
p132
aVYour heart starts beating faster.
p133
aVYou start sweating to dissipate the heat that you're going to
p134
aVcreate from muscular exertion.
p135
aVAnd that's fortunate, because we can put two electrodes on your palm
p136
aVand measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating.
p137
aVSo I can determine, when you're looking at something,
p138
aVwhether you're excited or whether you're aroused, or not, OK?
p139
aVAnd I'll get to that in a minute.
p140
aa(lp141
VSo my idea was, when this chap looks at an object, when he looks at his \u2014
p142
aVany object for that matter, it goes to the visual areas and,
p143
aVhowever, and it's processed in the fusiform gyrus,
p144
aVand you recognize it as a pea plant, or a table,
p145
aVor your mother, for that matter, OK?
p146
aVAnd then the message cascades into the amygdala,
p147
aVand then goes down the autonomic nervous system.
p148
aVBut maybe, in this chap, that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system,
p149
aVthe emotional core of the brain, is cut by the accident.
p150
aVSo because the fusiform is intact,
p151
aVthe chap can still recognize his mother,
p152
aVand says, "Oh yeah, this looks like my mother."
p153
aVBut because the wire is cut to the emotional centers,
p154
aVhe says, "But how come, if it's my mother, I don't experience a warmth?"
p155
aVOr terror, as the case may be? Right?
p156
aV(Laughter)
p157
aVAnd therefore, he says, "How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions?
p158
aVThis can't be my mother.
p159
aVIt's some strange woman pretending to be my mother."
p160
aa(lp161
VHow do you test this?
p162
aVWell, what you do is, if you take any one of you here, and put you in front of a screen,
p163
aVand measure your galvanic skin response,
p164
aVand show pictures on the screen,
p165
aVI can measure how you sweat when you see an object,
p166
aVlike a table or an umbrella. Of course, you don't sweat.
p167
aVIf I show you a picture of a lion, or a tiger, or a pinup, you start sweating, right?
p168
aVAnd, believe it or not, if I show you a picture of your mother \u2014
p169
aVI'm talking about normal people \u2014 you start sweating.
p170
aVYou don't even have to be Jewish.
p171
aV(Laughter)
p172
aa(lp173
VNow, what happens if you show this patient?
p174
aVYou take the patient and show him pictures on the screen
p175
aVand measure his galvanic skin response.
p176
aVTables and chairs and lint, nothing happens, as in normal people,
p177
aVbut when you show him a picture of his mother,
p178
aVthe galvanic skin response is flat.
p179
aVThere's no emotional reaction to his mother,
p180
aVbecause that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut.
p181
aVSo his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal,
p182
aVhis emotions are normal \u2014 he'll laugh, he'll cry, so on and so forth \u2014
p183
aVbut the wire from vision to emotions is cut
p184
aVand therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor.
p185
aVIt's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do:
p186
aVtake a bizarre, seemingly incomprehensible, neural psychiatric syndrome
p187
aVand say that the standard Freudian view is wrong,
p188
aVthat, in fact, you can come up with a precise explanation
p189
aVin terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain.
p190
aa(lp191
VBy the way, if this patient then goes,
p192
aVand mother phones from an adjacent room \u2014 phones him \u2014
p193
aVand he picks up the phone, and he says, "Wow, mom, how are you? Where are you?"
p194
aVThere's no delusion through the phone.
p195
aVThen, she approaches him after an hour, he says, "Who are you?
p196
aVYou look just like my mother." OK?
p197
aVThe reason is there's a separate pathway
p198
aVgoing from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers,
p199
aVand that's not been cut by the accident.
p200
aVSo this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother, no problem.
p201
aVWhen he sees her in person, he says it's an impostor.
p202
aa(lp203
VOK, how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain?
p204
aVIs it nature, genes, or is it nurture?
p205
aVAnd we approach this problem
p206
aVby considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb.
p207
aVAnd you all know what a phantom limb is.
p208
aVWhen an arm is amputated, or a leg is amputated, for gangrene,
p209
aVor you lose it in war \u2014 for example, in the Iraq war,
p210
aVit's now a serious problem \u2014
p211
aVyou continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm,
p212
aVand that's called a phantom arm or a phantom leg.
p213
aVIn fact, you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body.
p214
aVBelieve it or not, even with internal viscera.
p215
aVI've had patients with the uterus removed \u2014 hysterectomy \u2014
p216
aVwho have a phantom uterus, including phantom menstrual cramps
p217
aVat the appropriate time of the month.
p218
aVAnd in fact, one student asked me the other day,
p219
aV"Do they get phantom PMS?"
p220
aV(Laughter)
p221
aVA subject ripe for scientific enquiry, but we haven't pursued that.
p222
aa(lp223
VOK, now the next question is,
p224
aVwhat can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments?
p225
aVOne of the things we've found was,
p226
aVabout half the patients with phantom limbs
p227
aVclaim that they can move the phantom.
p228
aVIt'll pat his brother on the shoulder,
p229
aVit'll answer the phone when it rings, it'll wave goodbye.
p230
aVThese are very compelling, vivid sensations.
p231
aVThe patient's not delusional.
p232
aVHe knows that the arm is not there,
p233
aVbut, nevertheless, it's a compelling sensory experience for the patient.
p234
aVBut however, about half the patients, this doesn't happen.
p235
aVThe phantom limb \u2014 they'll say, "But doctor, the phantom limb is paralyzed.
p236
aVIt's fixed in a clenched spasm and it's excruciatingly painful.
p237
aVIf only I could move it, maybe the pain will be relieved."
p238
aa(lp239
VNow, why would a phantom limb be paralyzed?
p240
aVIt sounds like an oxymoron.
p241
aVBut when we were looking at the case sheets, what we found was,
p242
aVthese people with the paralyzed phantom limbs,
p243
aVthe original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury.
p244
aVThe actual nerve supplying the arm was severed,
p245
aVwas cut, by say, a motorcycle accident.
p246
aVSo the patient had an actual arm, which is painful,
p247
aVin a sling for a few months or a year, and then,
p248
aVin a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm,
p249
aVthe surgeon amputates the arm,
p250
aVand then you get a phantom arm with the same pains, right?
p251
aVAnd this is a serious clinical problem.
p252
aVPatients become depressed.
p253
aVSome of them are driven to suicide, OK?
p254
aa(lp255
VSo, how do you treat this syndrome?
p256
aVNow, why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb?
p257
aVWhen I looked at the case sheet, I found that they had an actual arm,
p258
aVand the nerves supplying the arm had been cut,
p259
aVand the actual arm had been paralyzed,
p260
aVand lying in a sling for several months before the amputation,
p261
aVand this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself.
p262
aa(lp263
VWhy does this happen?
p264
aVWhen the arm was intact, but paralyzed,
p265
aVthe brain sends commands to the arm, the front of the brain, saying, "Move,"
p266
aVbut it's getting visual feedback saying, "No."
p267
aVMove. No. Move. No. Move. No.
p268
aVAnd this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain,
p269
aVand we call this learned paralysis, OK?
p270
aVThe brain learns, because of this Hebbian, associative link,
p271
aVthat the mere command to move the arm
p272
aVcreates a sensation of a paralyzed arm.
p273
aVAnd then, when you've amputated the arm,
p274
aVthis learned paralysis carries over into your body image
p275
aVand into your phantom, OK?
p276
aa(lp277
VNow, how do you help these patients?
p278
aVHow do you unlearn the learned paralysis,
p279
aVso you can relieve him of this excruciating, clenching spasm
p280
aVof the phantom arm?
p281
aVWell, we said, what if you now send the command to the phantom,
p282
aVbut give him visual feedback that it's obeying his command, right?
p283
aVMaybe you can relieve the phantom pain, the phantom cramp.
p284
aVHow do you do that? Well, virtual reality.
p285
aVBut that costs millions of dollars.
p286
aVSo, I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars,
p287
aVbut don't tell my funding agencies.
p288
aV(Laughter)
p289
aa(lp290
VOK? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box.
p291
aVYou have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle,
p292
aVand then you put the phantom \u2014 so my first patient, Derek, came in.
p293
aVHe had his arm amputated 10 years ago.
p294
aVHe had a brachial avulsion, so the nerves were cut
p295
aVand the arm was paralyzed, lying in a sling for a year, and then the arm was amputated.
p296
aVHe had a phantom arm, excruciatingly painful, and he couldn't move it.
p297
aVIt was a paralyzed phantom arm.
p298
aa(lp299
VSo he came there, and I gave him a mirror like that, in a box,
p300
aVwhich I call a mirror box, right?
p301
aVAnd the patient puts his phantom left arm,
p302
aVwhich is clenched and in spasm, on the left side of the mirror,
p303
aVand the normal hand on the right side of the mirror,
p304
aVand makes the same posture, the clenched posture,
p305
aVand looks inside the mirror. And what does he experience?
p306
aVHe looks at the phantom being resurrected,
p307
aVbecause he's looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror,
p308
aVand it looks like this phantom has been resurrected.
p309
aV"Now," I said, "now, look, wiggle your phantom \u2014
p310
aVyour real fingers, or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror."
p311
aVHe's going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving, right?
p312
aVThat's obvious, but the astonishing thing is,
p313
aVthe patient then says, "Oh my God, my phantom is moving again,
p314
aVand the pain, the clenching spasm, is relieved."
p315
aa(lp316
VAnd remember, my first patient who came in \u2014
p317
aV(Applause)
p318
aV\u2014 thank you. (Applause)
p319
aVMy first patient came in, and he looked in the mirror,
p320
aVand I said, "Look at your reflection of your phantom."
p321
aVAnd he started giggling, he says, "I can see my phantom."
p322
aVBut he's not stupid. He knows it's not real.
p323
aVHe knows it's a mirror reflection,
p324
aVbut it's a vivid sensory experience.
p325
aVNow, I said, "Move your normal hand and phantom."
p326
aVHe said, "Oh, I can't move my phantom. You know that. It's painful."
p327
aVI said, "Move your normal hand."
p328
aVAnd he says, "Oh my God, my phantom is moving again. I don't believe this!
p329
aVAnd my pain is being relieved." OK?
p330
aVAnd then I said, "Close your eyes."
p331
aVHe closes his eyes.
p332
aV"And move your normal hand."
p333
aV"Oh, nothing. It's clenched again."
p334
aV"OK, open your eyes."
p335
aV"Oh my God, oh my God, it's moving again!"
p336
aVSo, he was like a kid in a candy store.
p337
aa(lp338
VSo, I said, OK, this proves my theory about learned paralysis
p339
aVand the critical role of visual input,
p340
aVbut I'm not going to get a Nobel Prize
p341
aVfor getting somebody to move his phantom limb.
p342
aV(Laughter)
p343
aV(Applause)
p344
aVIt's a completely useless ability, if you think about it.
p345
aV(Laughter)
p346
aVBut then I started realizing, maybe other kinds of paralysis
p347
aVthat you see in neurology, like stroke, focal dystonias \u2014
p348
aVthere may be a learned component to this,
p349
aVwhich you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror.
p350
aa(lp351
VSo, I said, "Look, Derek" \u2014
p352
aVwell, first of all, the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain \u2014
p353
aVI said, "Look, Derek, take it home and practice with it for a week or two.
p354
aVMaybe, after a period of practice,
p355
aVyou can dispense with the mirror, unlearn the paralysis,
p356
aVand start moving your paralyzed arm,
p357
aVand then, relieve yourself of pain."
p358
aVSo he said OK, and he took it home.
p359
aVI said, "Look, it's, after all, two dollars. Take it home."
p360
aa(lp361
VSo, he took it home, and after two weeks, he phones me,
p362
aVand he said, "Doctor, you're not going to believe this."
p363
aVI said, "What?"
p364
aVHe said, "It's gone."
p365
aVI said, "What's gone?"
p366
aVI thought maybe the mirror box was gone.
p367
aV(Laughter)
p368
aVHe said, "No, no, no, you know this phantom I've had for the last 10 years?
p369
aVIt's disappeared."
p370
aVAnd I said \u2014 I got worried, I said, my God,
p371
aVI mean I've changed this guy's body image,
p372
aVwhat about human subjects, ethics and all of that?
p373
aVAnd I said, "Derek, does this bother you?"
p374
aVHe said, "No, last three days, I've not had a phantom arm
p375
aVand therefore no phantom elbow pain, no clenching,
p376
aVno phantom forearm pain, all those pains are gone away.
p377
aVBut the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder,
p378
aVand your box doesn't reach."
p379
aV(Laughter)
p380
aV"So, can you change the design and put it on my forehead,
p381
aVso I can, you know, do this and eliminate my phantom fingers?"
p382
aVHe thought I was some kind of magician.
p383
aa(lp384
VNow, why does this happen?
p385
aVIt's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict.
p386
aVIt's getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back.
p387
aVOn the other hand, there's no proprioception,
p388
aVmuscle signals saying that there is no arm, right?
p389
aVAnd your motor command saying there is an arm,
p390
aVand, because of this conflict, the brain says, to hell with it,
p391
aVthere is no phantom, there is no arm, right?
p392
aVIt goes into a sort of denial \u2014 it gates the signals.
p393
aVAnd when the arm disappears, the bonus is, the pain disappears
p394
aVbecause you can't have disembodied pain floating out there, in space.
p395
aVSo, that's the bonus.
p396
aa(lp397
VNow, this technique has been tried on dozens of patients
p398
aVby other groups in Helsinki,
p399
aVso it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain,
p400
aVand indeed, people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation.
p401
aVStroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers,
p402
aVnothing you can do about it.
p403
aVBut, it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis,
p404
aVand maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors.
p405
aVThis has also gone through clinical trials,
p406
aVhelping lots and lots of patients.
p407
aa(lp408
VOK, let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk,
p409
aVwhich is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia.
p410
aVThis was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century.
p411
aVHe was a cousin of Charles Darwin.
p412
aVHe pointed out that certain people in the population,
p413
aVwho are otherwise completely normal, had the following peculiarity:
p414
aVevery time they see a number, it's colored.
p415
aVFive is blue, seven is yellow, eight is chartreuse,
p416
aVnine is indigo, OK?
p417
aVBear in mind, these people are completely normal in other respects.
p418
aVOr C sharp \u2014 sometimes, tones evoke color.
p419
aVC sharp is blue, F sharp is green,
p420
aVanother tone might be yellow, right?
p421
aa(lp422
VWhy does this happen?
p423
aVThis is called synesthesia. Galton called it synesthesia,
p424
aVa mingling of the senses.
p425
aVIn us, all the senses are distinct.
p426
aVThese people muddle up their senses.
p427
aVWhy does this happen?
p428
aVOne of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing.
p429
aVSynesthesia runs in families,
p430
aVso Galton said this is a hereditary basis, a genetic basis.
p431
aVSecondly, synesthesia is about \u2014 and this is what gets me to my point
p432
aVabout the main theme of this lecture, which is about creativity \u2014
p433
aVsynesthesia is eight times more common among artists, poets, novelists
p434
aVand other creative people than in the general population.
p435
aVWhy would that be?
p436
aVI'm going to answer that question.
p437
aVIt's never been answered before.
p438
aa(lp439
VOK, what is synesthesia? What causes it?
p440
aVWell, there are many theories.
p441
aVOne theory is they're just crazy.
p442
aVNow, that's not really a scientific theory, so we can forget about it.
p443
aVAnother theory is they are acid junkies and potheads, right?
p444
aVNow, there may be some truth to this,
p445
aVbecause it's much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego.
p446
aV(Laughter)
p447
aVOK. Now, the third theory is that \u2014
p448
aVwell, let's ask ourselves what's really going on in synesthesia. All right?
p449
aa(lp450
VSo, we found that the color area and the number area
p451
aVare right next to each other in the brain, in the fusiform gyrus.
p452
aVSo we said, there's some accidental cross wiring
p453
aVbetween color and numbers in the brain.
p454
aVSo, every time you see a number, you see a corresponding color,
p455
aVand that's why you get synesthesia.
p456
aVNow remember \u2014 why does this happen?
p457
aVWhy would there be crossed wires in some people?
p458
aVRemember I said it runs in families?
p459
aVThat gives you the clue.
p460
aVAnd that is, there is an abnormal gene,
p461
aVa mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring.
p462
aa(lp463
VIn all of us, it turns out
p464
aVwe are born with everything wired to everything else.
p465
aVSo, every brain region is wired to every other region,
p466
aVand these are trimmed down to create
p467
aVthe characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain.
p468
aVSo, if there's a gene causing this trimming
p469
aVand if that gene mutates,
p470
aVthen you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas.
p471
aVAnd if it's between number and color, you get number-color synesthesia.
p472
aVIf it's between tone and color, you get tone-color synesthesia.
p473
aVSo far, so good.
p474
aa(lp475
VNow, what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain,
p476
aVso everything is cross-connected?
p477
aVWell, think about what artists, novelists and poets have in common,
p478
aVthe ability to engage in metaphorical thinking,
p479
aVlinking seemingly unrelated ideas,
p480
aVsuch as, "It is the east, and Juliet is the Sun."
p481
aVWell, you don't say, Juliet is the sun,
p482
aVdoes that mean she's a glowing ball of fire?
p483
aVI mean, schizophrenics do that, but it's a different story, right?
p484
aVNormal people say, she's warm like the sun,
p485
aVshe's radiant like the sun, she's nurturing like the sun.
p486
aVInstantly, you've found the links.
p487
aa(lp488
VNow, if you assume that this greater cross wiring
p489
aVand concepts are also in different parts of the brain,
p490
aVthen it's going to create a greater propensity
p491
aVtowards metaphorical thinking and creativity
p492
aVin people with synesthesia.
p493
aVAnd, hence, the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia
p494
aVamong poets, artists and novelists.
p495
aVOK, it's a very phrenological view of synesthesia.
p496
aVThe last demonstration \u2014 can I take one minute?
p497
aV(Applause)
p498
aa(lp499
VOK. I'm going to show you that you're all synesthetes, but you're in denial about it.
p500
aVHere's what I call Martian alphabet. Just like your alphabet,
p501
aVA is A, B is B, C is C.
p502
aVDifferent shapes for different phonemes, right?
p503
aVHere, you've got Martian alphabet.
p504
aVOne of them is Kiki, one of them is Bouba.
p505
aVWhich one is Kiki and which one is Bouba?
p506
aVHow many of you think that's Kiki and that's Bouba? Raise your hands.
p507
aVWell, it's one or two mutants.
p508
aV(Laughter)
p509
aVHow many of you think that's Bouba, that's Kiki? Raise your hands.
p510
aVNinety-nine percent of you.
p511
aa(lp512
VNow, none of you is a Martian. How did you do that?
p513
aVIt's because you're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction,
p514
aVmeaning you're saying that that sharp inflection \u2014 ki-ki,
p515
aVin your auditory cortex, the hair cells being excited \u2014 Kiki,
p516
aVmimics the visual inflection, sudden inflection of that jagged shape.
p517
aVNow, this is very important, because what it's telling you
p518
aVis your brain is engaging in a primitive \u2014
p519
aVit's just \u2014 it looks like a silly illusion,
p520
aVbut these photons in your eye are doing this shape,
p521
aVand hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern,
p522
aVbut the brain is able to extract the common denominator.
p523
aVIt's a primitive form of abstraction,
p524
aVand we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain,
p525
aVbecause when that's damaged,
p526
aVthese people lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki,
p527
aVbut they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor.
p528
aa(lp529
VIf you ask this guy, what \u2014 "all that glitters is not gold,"
p530
aVwhat does that mean?"
p531
aVThe patient says, "Well, if it's metallic and shiny, it doesn't mean it's gold.
p532
aVYou have to measure its specific gravity, OK?"
p533
aVSo, they completely miss the metaphorical meaning.
p534
aVSo, this area is about eight times the size in higher \u2014
p535
aVespecially in humans \u2014 as in lower primates.
p536
aVSomething very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus,
p537
aVbecause it's the crossroads between hearing, vision and touch,
p538
aVand it became enormous in humans. And something very interesting is going on.
p539
aVAnd I think it's a basis of many uniquely human abilities
p540
aVlike abstraction, metaphor and creativity.
p541
aVAll of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia,
p542
aVwe scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging,
p543
aVand by studying patients and asking the right questions.
p544
aVThank you.
p545
aV(Applause)
p546
aVSorry about that.
