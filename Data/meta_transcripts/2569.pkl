VI once had this nightmare:
p4
aVI'm standing in the middle of a deserted field full of land mines.
p5
aVIn real life, I love to hike,
p6
aVbut every time I want to go on a hike, it makes me nervous.
p7
aVI have this thought in the back of my mind
p8
aVthat I might lose a limb.
p9
aa(lp10
VThis underlying fear started 10 years ago,
p11
aVafter I met Mohammed, a cluster bomb survivor
p12
aVof the summer 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War in Lebanon.
p13
aVMohammed, like so many other survivors all around the world,
p14
aVhad to live through the horrifying repercussions of cluster munitions
p15
aVon a daily basis.
p16
aa(lp17
VWhen the one-month conflict started in Lebanon,
p18
aVI was still working at Agence France-Presse in Paris.
p19
aVI remember how I was glued to the screens,
p20
aVanxiously following the news.
p21
aVI wanted to reassure myself
p22
aVthat the falling bombs missed my parents' home.
p23
aVWhen I arrived in Beirut on assignment to cover that war,
p24
aVI was relieved to be united with my family,
p25
aVafter they had finally managed to escape southern Lebanon.
p26
aVThe day the war was over,
p27
aVI remember seeing this image \u2014
p28
aVone of blocked roads,
p29
aVof displaced people eagerly rushing south, back to their homes,
p30
aVregardless of what they would find.
p31
aa(lp32
VAn estimated four million cluster submunitions
p33
aVwere spread in Lebanon during the 34-day conflict.
p34
aVMohammed lost both legs during the last week of the conflict.
p35
aVThe fact that he lives a five-minute drive from my parents' home
p36
aVmade it easier to follow him through the years.
p37
aVIt was now almost 10 years since we first met.
p38
aVI saw the young boy
p39
aVwho had to endure physical and emotional trauma.
p40
aVI saw the teenager who tried to offer his friends tattoos,
p41
aVin return for a set fee of five dollars.
p42
aVAnd I know the young, jobless man who spends hours surfing the Internet
p43
aVtrying to meet a girl who might become his girlfriend.
p44
aVHis fate and the effects of losing his legs
p45
aVare now his daily reality.
p46
aa(lp47
VSurvivors of bomb trauma like Mohammed
p48
aVhave to deal with so many details that never occur to us.
p49
aVWho would have imagined
p50
aVthat so many daily tasks we do or take for granted,
p51
aVsuch as going to the beach or even picking up something from the floor,
p52
aVwould become sources of stress and anxiety?
p53
aVWell, that's what eventually became of Mohammed,
p54
aVdue to his inflexible prosthetic legs.
p55
aa(lp56
VTen years ago, I had no clue what a cluster bomb was,
p57
aVnor its horrifying implications.
p58
aVI learned that this indiscriminate weapon was used
p59
aVin so many parts of the world
p60
aVand continues to kill on a regular basis,
p61
aVwithout distinguishing between a military target
p62
aVor a child.
p63
aVI naively asked myself,
p64
aV"But seriously, who made those weapons?
p65
aVAnd what for?"
p66
aa(lp67
VLet me explain to you what a cluster bomb is.
p68
aVIt's a large canister filled with bomblets.
p69
aVWhen it's dropped from the air,
p70
aVit opens up in midair to release hundreds of bomblets.
p71
aVThey scatter around wide areas
p72
aVand on impact,
p73
aVmany fail to explode.
p74
aVThose unexploded ones end up just like landmines \u2014
p75
aVsitting on the ground,
p76
aVwaiting for their next target.
p77
aVIf someone steps on them by accident
p78
aVor picks them up,
p79
aVthey can explode.
p80
aVThese weapons are extremely unpredictable,
p81
aVwhich makes the threat even bigger.
p82
aVOne day, a farmer can work his land without a problem.
p83
aVThe next day, he can make fire and burn some branches,
p84
aVand the submunitions close by could be set off because of the heat.
p85
aVThe problem is children mistake those bomblets for toys,
p86
aVbecause they can look like bouncy balls or soda cans.
p87
aa(lp88
VBeing a documentary photographer,
p89
aVI decided to go back to Lebanon a few months after the conflict ended
p90
aVto meet cluster bomb survivors.
p91
aVAnd I met a few \u2014
p92
aVHussein and Rasha,
p93
aVwho both lost a leg to submunitions.
p94
aVTheir stories are similar to so many other kids' stories across the world
p95
aVand are a testimony to the horrifying implications
p96
aVof the continuous use of such weapons.
p97
aa(lp98
VThat's when I met Mohammed, in January 2007.
p99
aVHe was 11 years old,
p100
aVand I met him exactly four months after his accident.
p101
aVWhen I first saw him,
p102
aVhe was going through painful physiotherapy
p103
aVto recover from his fresh wounds.
p104
aVStill in shock at such a young age,
p105
aVMohammed was struggling to get used to his new body.
p106
aVHe would even wake up sometimes at night wanting to scratch his lost feet.
p107
aVWhat drew me closer to his story was my instant realization
p108
aVof the difficulties Mohammed was likely to face in the future \u2014
p109
aVthat what he has been suffering while adjusting to his injury
p110
aVat the age of 11,
p111
aVwould increase manyfold.
p112
aa(lp113
VEven before his disability,
p114
aVMohammed's life wasn't easy.
p115
aVHe was born in the Rashidieh Camp for Palestinian refugees,
p116
aVand this is where he still lives.
p117
aVLebanon holds some 400,000 Palestinian refugees,
p118
aVand they suffer from discriminatory laws.
p119
aVThey're not allowed to work in the public sector
p120
aVor practice certain professions
p121
aVand are denied the right to own property.
p122
aVThis is one of the reasons
p123
aVwhy Mohammed doesn't really regret dropping out of school
p124
aVright after his injury.
p125
aVHe said, "What's the point of a university degree
p126
aVwhen I can't find a job to start with?"
p127
aa(lp128
VCluster bomb use creates a vicious circle of impact on communities,
p129
aVand not only the lives of their victims.
p130
aVMany who get injured by this weapon drop out of school,
p131
aVcan't find jobs or even lose their jobs,
p132
aVtherefore losing the ability to provide for their families.
p133
aVThis is not to mention the continuous physical pain
p134
aVand the experience of feeling isolated.
p135
aVThese weapons affect the poorest of the poor.
p136
aVThe high medical cost is a burden to the families.
p137
aVThey end up relying on humanitarian agencies,
p138
aVwhich is insufficient and unsustainable,
p139
aVespecially when injuries require lifelong support to the injured.
p140
aVTen years after Mohammed's injury,
p141
aVhe is still unable to afford proper prosthetic legs.
p142
aVHe's very cautious with his steps,
p143
aVas a couple of falls over the years
p144
aVbrought him embarrassment among his friends.
p145
aVHe joked that since he doesn't have legs,
p146
aVsome days he tries to walk on his hands.
p147
aa(lp148
VOne of the worst yet invisible impacts of the weapon
p149
aVis the psychological scars it leaves.
p150
aVIn one of Mohammed's early medical reports,
p151
aVhe was diagnosed with signs of PTSD.
p152
aVHe suffered from anxiety, poor appetite, sleep disturbance
p153
aVand showed signs of anger.
p154
aVThe reality is Mohammed never received proper help to fully recover.
p155
aVHis current obsession is to leave Lebanon at any cost \u2014
p156
aVeven if it meant embarking on a hazardous journey
p157
aValong with refugees drifting towards Europe today through the Mediterranean.
p158
aVKnowing how risky such a journey would be,
p159
aVhe said, "If I were to die on the way,
p160
aVit doesn't matter."
p161
aVTo Mohammed, he is dead here, anyway.
p162
aa(lp163
VCluster bombs are a world problem,
p164
aVas this munition keeps destroying and hurting whole communities
p165
aVfor generations to come.
p166
aVIn an online interview with the director of the Mines Advisory Group,
p167
aVJamie Franklin,
p168
aVhe said,
p169
aV"The US forces dropped over two million tons of munitions over Laos.
p170
aVIf they couldn't find their targets in Vietnam,
p171
aVthere were free-drop areas in Laos where planes would drop their loads
p172
aVbefore going back to base,
p173
aVbecause it's dangerous to land with loaded planes."
p174
aVAccording to the International Committee of the Red Cross,
p175
aVin Laos alone \u2014 one of the poorest countries in the world \u2014
p176
aVnine to 27 million unexploded submunitions remain.
p177
aVSome 11,000 people have been killed or injured since 1973.
p178
aVThis lethal weapon has been used by over 20 states during armed conflicts
p179
aVin over 35 countries,
p180
aVsuch as Ukraine, Iraq and Sudan.
p181
aa(lp182
VSo far, 119 states have joined an international treaty
p183
aVbanning cluster bombs,
p184
aVwhich is officially called the Convention on Cluster Munitions.
p185
aVBut some of the biggest producers of cluster munitions \u2014
p186
aVnamely, the United States, Russia and China \u2014
p187
aVremain outside of this lifesaving treaty
p188
aVand continue to produce them,
p189
aVreserve the right to produce them in the future,
p190
aVkeep those harmful weapons in their stockpiles
p191
aVand even possibly use them in the future.
p192
aa(lp193
VCluster bombs have reportedly been used most recently
p194
aVin the ongoing conflicts in Yemen and Syria.
p195
aVAccording to research on the worldwide investments
p196
aVin cluster munitions producers
p197
aVby Pax, a Dutch-based NGO,
p198
aVfinancial institutions invested billions of US dollars
p199
aVinto companies that make cluster munitions.
p200
aVThe majority of these institutions are based in countries
p201
aVthat have not yet signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions.
p202
aa(lp203
VGetting back to Mohammed,
p204
aVone of the few jobs he was able to find was picking lemons.
p205
aVWhen I ask him if it's safe to work in the field he said,
p206
aV"I'm not sure."
p207
aVResearch shows that cluster munitions often contaminate areas
p208
aVwhere agriculture is the main source of income.
p209
aVAccording to Handicap International's research,
p210
aV98 percent of those killed or injured by cluster munitions are civilians.
p211
aVEighty-four percent of casualties are males.
p212
aVIn countries where these people have no choice
p213
aVbut to work in those fields,
p214
aVthey simply do it
p215
aVand risk it.
p216
aa(lp217
VMohammed is the only male to three sisters.
p218
aVCulturally, he's expected to provide for his family,
p219
aVbut he simply can't.
p220
aVHe tried to have so many different jobs,
p221
aVbut he couldn't keep any due to his physical disability
p222
aVand the less-than-friendly environment to people with disabilities,
p223
aVto say the least.
p224
aVIt hurts him a lot when he goes out looking for a job,
p225
aVand he's turned away
p226
aVwith a small amount of money paid to him out of pity.
p227
aVHe said, "I'm not here to beg for money,
p228
aVI just want to earn it."
p229
aa(lp230
VMohammed today is 21 years old.
p231
aVHe's illiterate,
p232
aVand he communicates with voice messages.
p233
aVHere is one of his messages.
p234
aa(lp235
V(Audio) Mohammed: (Speaking in Arabic)
p236
aa(lp237
VLaura Boushnak: He said, "My dream is to run,
p238
aVand I'm pretty sure once I start running,
p239
aVI would never stop."
