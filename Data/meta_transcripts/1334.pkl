VIs there a real you?
p4
aVThis might seem to you  like a very odd question.
p5
aVBecause, you might ask,
p6
aVhow do we find the real you,
p7
aVhow do you know what the real you is?
p8
aVAnd so forth.
p9
aa(lp10
VBut the idea that there must be a real you,
p11
aVsurely that's obvious.
p12
aVIf there's anything real  in the world, it's you.
p13
aVWell, I'm not quite sure.
p14
aVAt least we have to understand  a bit better what that means.
p15
aVNow certainly, I think there are lots of things in our culture around us
p16
aVwhich sort of reinforce the idea
p17
aVthat for each one of us, we have a kind of a core, an essence.
p18
aVThere is something about what it means to be you which defines you,
p19
aVand it's kind of permanent and unchanging.
p20
aVThe most kind of crude way in which we have it,
p21
aVare things like horoscopes.
p22
aVYou know, people are very wedded to these, actually.
p23
aVPeople put them on their Facebook profile
p24
aVas though they are meaningul,
p25
aVyou even know  your Chinese horoscope as well.
p26
aVThere are also  more scientific versions of this,
p27
aVall sorts of ways of profiling personality type,
p28
aVsuch as the Myers-Briggs tests, for example.
p29
aVI don't know if you've done those.
p30
aVA lot of companies  use these for recruitment.
p31
aVYou answer a lot of questions,
p32
aVand this is supposed to reveal something about your core personality.
p33
aVAnd of course, the popular fascination  with this is enormous.
p34
aVIn magazines like this, you'll see,
p35
aVin the bottom left corner, they'll advertise in virtually every issue
p36
aVsome kind of personality thing.
p37
aVAnd if you pick up one of those magazines,
p38
aVit's hard to resist, isn't it?
p39
aVDoing the test to find what is your learning style,
p40
aVwhat is your loving style, or what is your working style?
p41
aVAre you this kind of person or that?
p42
aa(lp43
VSo I think that we have a common-sense idea
p44
aVthat there is a kind of core  or essence of ourselves
p45
aVto be discovered.
p46
aVAnd that this is kind of a permanent truth about ourselves,
p47
aVsomething that's the same throughout life.
p48
aVWell, that's the idea I want to challenge.
p49
aVAnd I have to say now, I'll say it a bit later,
p50
aVbut I'm not challenging this just because I'm weird,
p51
aVthe challenge actually has a very, very long and distinguished history.
p52
aVHere's the common-sense idea.
p53
aVThere is you.
p54
aVYou are the individuals you are, and you have this kind of core.
p55
aVNow in your life, what happens is that you, of course,
p56
aVaccumulate different experiences and so forth.
p57
aVSo you have memories,
p58
aVand these memories help  to create what you are.
p59
aVYou have desires, maybe for a cookie,
p60
aVmaybe for something that we don't want to talk about
p61
aVat 11 o'clock in the morning in a school.
p62
aVYou will have beliefs.
p63
aVThis is a number plate from someone in America.
p64
aVI don't know whether this number plate, which says "messiah 1,"
p65
aVindicates that the driver believes in the messiah,
p66
aVor that they are the messiah.
p67
aVEither way, they have beliefs  about messiahs.
p68
aVWe have knowledge.
p69
aVWe have sensations and experiences as well.
p70
aVIt's not just intellectual things.
p71
aVSo this is kind of  the common-sense model, I think,
p72
aVof what a person is.
p73
aVThere is a person who has all the things that make up our life experiences.
p74
aa(lp75
VBut the suggestion  I want to put to you today
p76
aVis that there's something  fundamentally wrong with this model.
p77
aVAnd I can show you what's wrong with one click.
p78
aVWhich is there isn't actually a "you" at the heart of all these experiences.
p79
aVStrange thought? Well, maybe not.
p80
aVWhat is there, then?
p81
aVWell, clearly there are memories, desires, intentions, sensations,
p82
aVand so forth.
p83
aVBut what happens is these things exist,
p84
aVand they're kind of all integrated,
p85
aVthey're overlapped, they're connected in various different ways.
p86
aVThey're connecting partly, and perhaps even mainly,
p87
aVbecause they all belong to one body and one brain.
p88
aVBut there's also a narrative,  a story we tell about ourselves,
p89
aVthe experiences we have when we remember past things.
p90
aVWe do things because of other things.
p91
aVSo what we desire is partly a result of what we believe,
p92
aVand what we remember is also informing us what we know.
p93
aVAnd so really, there are all these things,
p94
aVlike beliefs, desires,  sensations, experiences,
p95
aVthey're all related to each other,
p96
aVand that just is you.
p97
aVIn some ways, it's a small difference from the common-sense understanding.
p98
aVIn some ways, it's a massive one.
p99
aa(lp100
VIt's the shift between thinking of yourself
p101
aVas a thing which has  all the experiences of life,
p102
aVand thinking of yourself as simply that collection
p103
aVof all experiences in life.
p104
aVYou are the sum of your parts.
p105
aVNow those parts are also physical parts,  of course,
p106
aVbrains, bodies and legs and things,
p107
aVbut they aren't so important, actually.
p108
aVIf you have a heart transplant, you're still the same person.
p109
aVIf you have a memory transplant, are you the same person?
p110
aVIf you have a belief transplant,  would you be the same person?
p111
aVNow this idea, that what we are,  the way to understand ourselves,
p112
aVis as not of some permanent being, which has experiences,
p113
aVbut is kind of a collection of experiences,
p114
aVmight strike you as kind of weird.
p115
aa(lp116
VBut actually, I don't think  it should be weird.
p117
aVIn a way, it's common sense.
p118
aVBecause I just invite you  to think about, by comparison,
p119
aVthink about pretty much anything else in the universe,
p120
aVmaybe apart from the  very most fundamental forces or powers.
p121
aVLet's take something like water.
p122
aVNow my science isn't very good.
p123
aVWe might say something like  water has two parts hydrogen
p124
aVand one parts oxygen, right?
p125
aVWe all know that.
p126
aVI hope no one in this room thinks that what that means
p127
aVis there is a thing called water,  and attached to it
p128
aVare hydrogen and oxygen atoms,
p129
aVand that's what water is.
p130
aVOf course we don't.
p131
aVWe understand, very easily, very straightforwardly,
p132
aVthat water is nothing more
p133
aVthan the hydrogen and oxygen molecules suitably arranged.
p134
aVEverything else in the universe is the same.
p135
aVThere's no mystery about my watch, for example.
p136
aVWe say the watch has a face, and hands,
p137
aVand a mechanism and a battery,
p138
aVBut what we really mean is,
p139
aVwe don't think  there is a thing called the watch
p140
aVto which we then attach all these bits.
p141
aVWe understand very clearly  that you get the parts of the watch,
p142
aVyou put them together, and you create a watch.
p143
aVNow if everything else  in the universe is like this,
p144
aVwhy are we different?
p145
aa(lp146
VWhy think of ourselves
p147
aVas somehow not just being  a collection of all our parts,
p148
aVbut somehow being a separate, permanent entity which has those parts?
p149
aVNow this view is not particularly new,  actually.
p150
aVIt has quite a long lineage.
p151
aVYou find it in Buddhism,
p152
aVyou find it in 17th,  18th-century philosophy
p153
aVgoing through to the current day, people like Locke and Hume.
p154
aVBut interestingly, it's also a view
p155
aVincreasingly being heard reinforced by neuroscience.
p156
aVThis is Paul Broks,  he's a clinical neuropsychologist,
p157
aVand he says this:
p158
aV"We have a deep intuition that there is a core,
p159
aVan essence there,  and it's hard to shake off,
p160
aVprobably impossible to shake off,  I suspect.
p161
aVBut it's true that neuroscience shows that there is no centre in the brain
p162
aVwhere things do all come together."
p163
aVSo when you look at the brain,
p164
aVand you look at how the brain makes possible a sense of self,
p165
aVyou find that there isn't  a central control spot in the brain.
p166
aVThere is no kind of center where everything happens.
p167
aVThere are lots of different processes in the brain,
p168
aVall of which operate, in a way, quite independently.
p169
aVBut it's because of the way  that they relate
p170
aVthat we get this sense of self.
p171
aVThe term I use in the book,  I call it the ego trick.
p172
aVIt's like a mechanical trick.
p173
aVIt's not that we don't exist,
p174
aVit's just that the trick is  to make us feel that inside of us
p175
aVis something more unified than is really there.
p176
aa(lp177
VNow you might think this is a worrying idea.
p178
aVYou might think that if it's true,
p179
aVthat for each one of us there is no abiding core of self,
p180
aVno permanent essence,
p181
aVdoes that mean that really, the self is an illusion?
p182
aVDoes it mean that we really don't exist?
p183
aVThere is no real you.
p184
aVWell, a lot of people actually do use  this talk of illusion and so forth.
p185
aVThese are three psychologists, Thomas Metzinger, Bruce Hood,
p186
aVSusan Blackmore,
p187
aVa lot of these people do talk  the language of illusion,
p188
aVthe self is an illusion, it's a fiction.
p189
aVBut I don't think this is  a very helpful way of looking at it.
p190
aVGo back to the watch.
p191
aVThe watch isn't an illusion,  because there is nothing to the watch
p192
aVother than a collection of its parts.
p193
aVIn the same way,  we're not illusions either.
p194
aVThe fact that we are, in some ways, just this very, very complex collection,
p195
aVordered collection of things,
p196
aVdoes not mean we're not real.
p197
aVI can give you  a very sort of rough metaphor for this.
p198
aVLet's take something like a waterfall.
p199
aVThese are the Iguazu Falls, in Argentina.
p200
aVNow if you take something like this,
p201
aVyou can appreciate the fact  that in lots of ways,
p202
aVthere's nothing permanent about this.
p203
aVFor one thing, it's always changing.
p204
aVThe waters  are always carving new channels.
p205
aVwith changes and tides and the weather,
p206
aVsome things dry up,  new things are created.
p207
aVOf course the water that flows  through the waterfall
p208
aVis different every single instance.
p209
aVBut it doesn't mean that  the Iguazu Falls are an illusion.
p210
aVIt doesn't mean it's not real.
p211
aVWhat it means is we have  to understand what it is
p212
aVas something which has a history,
p213
aVhas certain things that keep it together,
p214
aVbut it's a process, it's fluid,  it's forever changing.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow that, I think, is a model for understanding ourselves,
p217
aVand I think it's a liberating model.
p218
aVBecause if you think that you have this fixed, permanent essence,
p219
aVwhich is always the same, throughout your life, no matter what,
p220
aVin a sense you're kind of trapped.
p221
aVYou're born with an essence,
p222
aVthat's what you are until you die,
p223
aVif you believe in an afterlife,  maybe you continue.
p224
aVBut if you think of yourself as being, in a way,
p225
aVnot a thing as such,  but a kind of a process,
p226
aVsomething that is changing,
p227
aVthen I think that's quite liberating.
p228
aVBecause unlike the the waterfalls,
p229
aVwe actually have the capacity to channel
p230
aVthe direction of our development for ourselves to a certain degree.
p231
aVNow we've got to be careful here, right?
p232
aVIf you watch the X-Factor too much, you might buy into this idea
p233
aVthat we can all be whatever we want to be.
p234
aVThat's not true.
p235
aVI've heard some fantastic musicians this morning,
p236
aVand I am very confident that I could in no way be as good as them.
p237
aVI could practice hard  and maybe be good,
p238
aVbut I don't have that really natural ability.
p239
aVThere are limits to what we can achieve.
p240
aVThere are limits to what  we can make of ourselves.
p241
aVBut nevertheless, we do have  this capacity
p242
aVto, in a sense, shape ourselves.
p243
aVThe true self, as it were then,
p244
aVis not something that is just there for you to discover,
p245
aVyou don't sort of look into your soul and find your true self,
p246
aVWhat you are partly doing, at least,
p247
aVis actually creating your true self.
p248
aVAnd this, I think, is very, very significant,
p249
aVparticularly at this stage of life you're at.
p250
aVYou'll be aware of the fact
p251
aVhow much of you changed over recent years.
p252
aVIf you have any videos of yourself,  three or four years ago,
p253
aVyou probably feel embarrassed  because you don't recognize yourself.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo I want to get that message over, that what we need to do
p256
aVis think about ourselves as things that we can shape,
p257
aVand channel and change.
p258
aVThis is the Buddha, again:
p259
aV"Well-makers lead the water,
p260
aVfletchers bend the arrow,
p261
aVcarpenters bend a log of wood,
p262
aVwise people fashion themselves."
p263
aVAnd that's the idea  I want to leave you with,
p264
aVthat your true self is not something  that you will have to go searching for,
p265
aVas a mystery, and maybe never ever find.
p266
aVTo the extent you have a true self,
p267
aVit's something that you in part discover,
p268
aVbut in part create.
p269
aVand that, I think,  is a liberating and exciting prospect.
p270
aVThank you very much.
