VAs an Indian, and now as a politician
p4
aVand a government minister,
p5
aVI've become rather concerned about
p6
aVthe hype we're hearing about our own country,
p7
aVall this talk about India becoming a world leader,
p8
aVeven the next superpower.
p9
aVIn fact, the American publishers of my book,
p10
aV"The Elephant, The Tiger and the Cell Phone,"
p11
aVadded a gratuitous subtitle saying,
p12
aV"India: The next 21st-century power."
p13
aVAnd I just don't think that's what India's all about,
p14
aVor should be all about.
p15
aa(lp16
VIndeed, what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership
p17
aVseems to me terribly archaic.
p18
aVIt's redolent of James Bond movies
p19
aVand Kipling ballads.
p20
aVAfter all, what constitutes a world leader?
p21
aVIf it's population, we're on course to top the charts.
p22
aVWe will overtake China by 2034.
p23
aVIs it military strength? Well, we have the world's fourth largest army.
p24
aVIs it nuclear capacity? We know we have that.
p25
aVThe Americans have even recognized it,
p26
aVin an agreement.
p27
aVIs it the economy? Well, we have now
p28
aVthe fifth-largest economy in the world
p29
aVin purchasing power parity terms.
p30
aVAnd we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year,
p31
aVwe grew at 6.7 percent.
p32
aa(lp33
VBut, somehow, none of that adds up to me,
p34
aVto what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world,
p35
aVin this part of the 21st century.
p36
aVAnd so I wondered, could
p37
aVwhat the future beckons for India to be all about
p38
aVbe a combination of these things allied to something else,
p39
aVthe power of example,
p40
aVthe attraction of India's culture,
p41
aVwhat, in other words, people like to call "soft power."
p42
aa(lp43
VSoft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic,
p44
aVJoseph Nye, a friend of mine.
p45
aVAnd, very simply, and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here,
p46
aVit's essentially the ability of a country to attract others
p47
aVbecause of its culture, its political values,
p48
aVits foreign policies.
p49
aVAnd, you know, lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States,
p50
aVbut we know the Alliance Francaise
p51
aVis all about French soft power, the British Council.
p52
aVThe Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power.
p53
aVAmericans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships.
p54
aVBut, the fact is, in fact,
p55
aVthat probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds
p56
aVhave done more for American soft power
p57
aVaround the world than any specifically government activity.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo soft power is something that really emerges
p60
aVpartly because of governments,
p61
aVbut partly despite governments.
p62
aVAnd in the information era we all live in today,
p63
aVwhat we might call the TED age,
p64
aVI'd say that countries are increasingly being judged
p65
aVby a global public that's been fed
p66
aVon an incessant diet of Internet news,
p67
aVof televised images,
p68
aVof cellphone videos, of email gossip.
p69
aVIn other words, all sorts of communication devices
p70
aVare telling us the stories of countries,
p71
aVwhether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, in this age, again, countries with access
p74
aVto multiple channels of communication
p75
aVand information have a particular advantage.
p76
aVAnd of course they have more influence, sometimes, about how they're seen.
p77
aVIndia has more all-news TV channels
p78
aVthan any country in the world,
p79
aVin fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together.
p80
aa(lp81
VBut, the fact still is that it's not just that.
p82
aVIn order to have soft power, you have to be connected.
p83
aVOne might argue that India has become
p84
aVan astonishingly connected country.
p85
aVI think you've already heard the figures.
p86
aVWe've been selling 15 million cellphones a month.
p87
aVCurrently there are 509 million cellphones
p88
aVin Indian hands, in India.
p89
aVAnd that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market.
p90
aVIn fact, those 15 million cellphones
p91
aVare the most connections that any country,
p92
aVincluding the U.S. and China,
p93
aVhas ever established in the history of telecommunications.
p94
aa(lp95
VBut, what perhaps some of you don't realize
p96
aVis how far we've come to get there.
p97
aVYou know, when I grew up in India,
p98
aVtelephones were a rarity.
p99
aVIn fact, they were so rare that elected members of Parliament
p100
aVhad the right to allocate 15 telephone lines
p101
aVas a favor to those they deemed worthy.
p102
aVIf you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman
p103
aVor an influential journalist, or a doctor or something, you might have a telephone.
p104
aVBut sometimes it just sat there.
p105
aa(lp106
VI went to high school in Calcutta.
p107
aVAnd we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer.
p108
aVBut half the time we would pick it up
p109
aVwith an expectant look on our faces,
p110
aVthere would be no dial tone.
p111
aVIf there was a dial tone and you dialed a number,
p112
aVthe odds were two in three you wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach.
p113
aVIn fact the words "wrong number" were more popular than the word "Hello."
p114
aV(Laughter)
p115
aVIf you then wanted to connect to another city,
p116
aVlet's say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi,
p117
aVyou'd have to book something called a trunk call,
p118
aVand then sit by the phone all day, waiting for it to come through.
p119
aVOr you could pay eight times the going rate
p120
aVfor something called a lightning call.
p121
aVBut, lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days,
p122
aVso, it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through.
p123
aa(lp124
VIn fact, so woeful was our telephone service
p125
aVthat a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this.
p126
aVAnd the Then-Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner
p127
aVthat in a developing country
p128
aVcommunications are a luxury, not a right,
p129
aVthat the government had no obligation to provide better service,
p130
aVand if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone,
p131
aVcould he please return it, since there was an eight-year-long waiting list
p132
aVfor telephones in India.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow, fast-forward to today and this is what you see:
p135
aVthe 15 million cell phones a month.
p136
aVBut what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones.
p137
aVYou know, if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi,
p138
aVon the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart
p139
aVthat looks like it was designed in the 16th century,
p140
aVwielding a coal-fired steam iron
p141
aVthat might have been invented in the 18th century.
p142
aVHe's called an isthri wala. But he's carrying a 21st-century instrument.
p143
aVHe's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free,
p144
aVand that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood,
p145
aVto know where to collect clothes to get them ironed.
p146
aa(lp147
VThe other day I was in Kerala, my home state,
p148
aVat the country farm of a friend,
p149
aVabout 20 kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban.
p150
aVAnd it was a hot day and he said, "Hey, would you like some fresh coconut water?"
p151
aVAnd it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink
p152
aVon a hot day in the tropics, so I said sure.
p153
aVAnd he whipped out his cellphone, dialed the number,
p154
aVand a voice said, "I'm up here."
p155
aVAnd right on top of the nearest coconut tree,
p156
aVwith a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other,
p157
aVwas a local toddy tapper,
p158
aVwho proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink.
p159
aa(lp160
VFishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones.
p161
aVWhen they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast
p162
aVto find out where they get the best possible prices.
p163
aVFarmers now, who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor
p164
aVto find out if the market town was open,
p165
aVif the market was on,
p166
aVwhether the product they'd harvested could be sold, what price they'd fetch.
p167
aVThey'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge
p168
aVto the market town to get that information and come back,
p169
aVthen they'd load the cart.
p170
aVToday they're saving half a day's labor with a two minute phone call.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo this empowerment of the underclass
p173
aVis the real result of India being connected.
p174
aVAnd that transformation is part of where India is heading today.
p175
aVBut, of course that's not the only thing about India that's spreading.
p176
aVYou've got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized
p177
aVin the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump \u2014
p178
aVMr. Shekhar Kapur, forgive me \u2014
p179
aVand they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio.
p180
aVAnd the first goat, chewing away, says, "You know, this film is not bad."
p181
aVAnd the second goat says, "No, the book was better."
p182
aV(Laughter)
p183
aa(lp184
VI usually tend to think that the book is usually better,
p185
aVbut, having said that,
p186
aVthe fact is that Bollywood is now
p187
aVtaking a certain aspect of Indian-ness and Indian culture around the globe,
p188
aVnot just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K.,
p189
aVbut to the screens of Arabs and Africans, of Senegalese and Syrians.
p190
aVI've met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother
p191
aVin a village in Senegal
p192
aVtakes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar,
p193
aVjust to watch a Bollywood movie.
p194
aVShe can't understand the dialogue.
p195
aVShe's illiterate, so she can't read the French subtitles.
p196
aVBut these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps,
p197
aVand she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action.
p198
aVShe goes away with stars in her eyes about India, as a result.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd this is happening more and more.
p201
aVAfghanistan, we know what a serious security problem
p202
aVAfghanistan is for so many of us in the world.
p203
aVIndia doesn't have a military mission there.
p204
aVYou know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years?
p205
aVOne simple fact:
p206
aVyou couldn't try to call an Afghan at 8:30 in the evening.
p207
aVWhy? Because that was the moment
p208
aVwhen the Indian television soap opera,
p209
aV"Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi," dubbed into Dari, was telecast on Tolo T.V.
p210
aVAnd it was the most popular television show in Afghan history.
p211
aVEvery Afghan family wanted to watch it.
p212
aVThey had to suspend functions at 8:30.
p213
aVWeddings were reported to be interrupted
p214
aVso guests could cluster around the T.V. set,
p215
aVand then turn their attention back to the bride and groom.
p216
aVCrime went up at 8:30. I have read a Reuters dispatch \u2014
p217
aVso this is not Indian propaganda, a British news agency \u2014
p218
aVabout how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif*
p219
aVstripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers,
p220
aVits hubcaps, its sideview mirrors,
p221
aVany moving part they could find, at 8:30,
p222
aVbecause the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store.
p223
aVAnd they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine,
p224
aV"Tulsi Zindabad": "Long live Tulsi."
p225
aV(Laughter)
p226
aa(lp227
VThat's soft power. And that is what India is developing
p228
aVthrough the "E" part of TED:
p229
aVits own entertainment industry.
p230
aVThe same is true, of course \u2014 we don't have time for too many more examples \u2014
p231
aVbut it's true of our music, of our dance,
p232
aVof our art, yoga, ayurveda, even Indian cuisine.
p233
aVI mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurants
p234
aVsince I first went abroad as a student, in the mid '70s,
p235
aVand what I see today, you can't go to a mid-size town in Europe or North America
p236
aVand not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one.
p237
aVBut, today in Britain, for example,
p238
aVIndian restaurants in Britain
p239
aVemploy more people than the coal mining,
p240
aVship building and iron and steel industries combined.
p241
aVSo the empire can strike back.
p242
aV(Applause)
p243
aa(lp244
VBut, with this increasing awareness of India,
p245
aVwith you and with I, and so on,
p246
aVwith tales like Afghanistan,
p247
aVcomes something vital in the information era,
p248
aVthe sense that in today's world
p249
aVit's not the side of the bigger army that wins,
p250
aVit's the country that tells a better story that prevails.
p251
aVAnd India is, and must remain, in my view, the land of the better story.
p252
aVStereotypes are changing. I mean, again, having gone to the U.S.
p253
aVas a student in the mid '70s,
p254
aVI knew what the image of India was then, if there was an image at all.
p255
aa(lp256
VToday, people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere
p257
aVspeak of the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Technology
p258
aVwith the same reverence they used to accord to MIT.
p259
aVThis can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK.
p260
aVI had a friend, a history major like me,
p261
aVwho was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam,
p262
aVby an anxiously perspiring European saying,
p263
aV"You're Indian, you're Indian! Can you help me fix my laptop?"
p264
aV(Laughter)
p265
aa(lp266
VWe've gone from the image of India as
p267
aVland of fakirs lying on beds of nails,
p268
aVand snake charmers with the Indian rope trick,
p269
aVto the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses,
p270
aVcomputer wizards, software gurus.
p271
aVBut that too is transforming the Indian story around the world.
p272
aVBut, there is something more substantive to that.
p273
aVThe story rests on a fundamental platform
p274
aVof political pluralism.
p275
aVIt's a civilizational story to begin with.
p276
aVBecause India has been an open society for millennia.
p277
aVIndia gave refuge to the Jews, fleeing the destruction of the first temple
p278
aVby the Babylonians, and said thereafter by the Romans.
p279
aa(lp280
VIn fact, legend has is that when Doubting Thomas, the Apostle, Saint Thomas,
p281
aVlanded on the shores of Kerala, my home state,
p282
aVsomewhere around 52 A.D.,
p283
aVhe was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing Jewish girl.
p284
aVAnd to this day remains the only Jewish diaspora
p285
aVin the history of the Jewish people, which has never encountered
p286
aVa single incident of anti-semitism.
p287
aV(Applause)
p288
aVThat's the Indian story.
p289
aVIslam came peacefully to the south,
p290
aVslightly more differently complicated history in the north.
p291
aVBut all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India.
p292
aa(lp293
VYou know, we just celebrated, this year, our general elections,
p294
aVthe biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history.
p295
aVAnd the next one will be even bigger, because our voting population
p296
aVkeeps growing by 20 million a year.
p297
aVBut, the fact is
p298
aVthat the last elections, five years ago,
p299
aVgave the world extraordinary phenomenon
p300
aVof an election being won by a woman political leader
p301
aVof Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith, Sonia Gandhi,
p302
aVwho then made way for a Sikh, Mohan Singh,
p303
aVto be sworn in as Prime Minister
p304
aVby a Muslim, President Abdul Kalam,
p305
aVin a country 81 percent Hindu.
p306
aV(Applause)
p307
aa(lp308
VThis is India, and of course it's all the more striking
p309
aVbecause it was four years later that we all applauded
p310
aVthe U.S., the oldest democracy in the modern world,
p311
aVmore than 220 years of free and fair elections,
p312
aVwhich took till last year to elect a president or a vice president
p313
aVwho wasn't white, male or Christian.
p314
aVSo, maybe \u2014 oh sorry, he is Christian, I beg your pardon \u2014
p315
aVand he is male, but he isn't white.
p316
aVAll the others have been all those three.
p317
aV(Laughter)
p318
aVAll his predecessors have been all those three,
p319
aVand that's the point I was trying to make.
p320
aV(Laughter)
p321
aa(lp322
VBut, the issue is
p323
aVthat when I talked about that example,
p324
aVit's not just about talking about India, it's not propaganda.
p325
aVBecause ultimately, that electoral outcome
p326
aVhad nothing to do with the rest of the world.
p327
aVIt was essentially India being itself.
p328
aVAnd ultimately, it seems to me,
p329
aVthat always works better than propaganda.
p330
aVGovernments aren't very good at telling stories.
p331
aVBut people see a society for what it is,
p332
aVand that, it seems to me, is what ultimately
p333
aVwill make a difference in today's information era,
p334
aVin today's TED age.
p335
aa(lp336
VSo India now is no longer
p337
aVthe nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion,
p338
aVbecause we have every ethnicity known to mankind, practically,
p339
aVwe've every religion know to mankind,
p340
aVwith the possible exception of Shintoism,
p341
aVthough that has some Hindu elements somewhere.
p342
aVWe have 23 official languages that are recognized in our Constitution.
p343
aVAnd those of you who cashed your money here
p344
aVmight be surprised to see how many scripts there are
p345
aVon the rupee note, spelling out the denominations.
p346
aVWe've got all of that.
p347
aVWe don't even have geography uniting us,
p348
aVbecause the natural geography of the subcontinent
p349
aVframed by the mountains and the sea was hacked
p350
aVby the partition with Pakistan in 1947.
p351
aVIn fact, you can't even take the name of the country for granted,
p352
aVbecause the name "India" comes from the river Indus,
p353
aVwhich flows in Pakistan.
p354
aa(lp355
VBut, the whole point is that India
p356
aVis the nationalism of an idea.
p357
aVIt's the idea of an ever-ever-land,
p358
aVemerging from an ancient civilization,
p359
aVunited by a shared history,
p360
aVbut sustained, above all, by pluralist democracy.
p361
aVThat is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one.
p362
aVAnd it's the nationalism of an idea that
p363
aVessentially says you can endure differences of caste, creed,
p364
aVcolor, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant, for that matter,
p365
aVand still rally around a consensus.
p366
aVAnd the consensus is of a very simple principle,
p367
aVthat in a diverse plural democracy like India
p368
aVyou don't really have to agree on everything all the time,
p369
aVso long as you agree on the ground rules
p370
aVof how you will disagree.
p371
aVThe great success story of India,
p372
aVa country that so many learned scholars and journalists
p373
aVassumed would disintegrate, in the '50s and '60s,
p374
aVis that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus.
p375
aa(lp376
VNow, that is the India that is emerging into the 21st century.
p377
aVAnd I do want to make the point
p378
aVthat if there is anything worth celebrating about India,
p379
aVit isn't military muscle, economic power.
p380
aVAll of that is necessary,
p381
aVbut we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome.
p382
aVSomebody said we are super poor, and we are also super power.
p383
aVWe can't really be both of those.
p384
aVWe have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the
p385
aVhardware of development,
p386
aVthe ports, the roads, the airports,
p387
aVall the infrastructural things we need to do,
p388
aVand the software of development,
p389
aVthe human capital, the need for the ordinary person in India
p390
aVto be able to have a couple of square meals a day,
p391
aVto be able to send his or her children
p392
aVto a decent school,
p393
aVand to aspire to work a job
p394
aVthat will give them opportunities in their lives
p395
aVthat can transform themselves.
p396
aa(lp397
VBut, it's all taking place, this great adventure of conquering those challenges,
p398
aVthose real challenges which none of us can pretend don't exist.
p399
aVBut, it's all taking place in an open society,
p400
aVin a rich and diverse and plural civilization,
p401
aVin one that is determined to liberate and fulfill
p402
aVthe creative energies of its people.
p403
aVThat's why India belongs at TED,
p404
aVand that's why TED belongs in India.
p405
aVThank you very much.
