VIn the 1980s, in communist Eastern Germany,
p4
aVif you owned a typewriter,
p5
aVyou had to register it with the government.
p6
aVYou had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter.
p7
aVAnd this was done so the government could track
p8
aVwhere the text was coming from.
p9
aVIf they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought,
p10
aVthey could track down who created that thought.
p11
aVAnd we in the West
p12
aVcouldn't understand how anybody would do this,
p13
aVhow much this would restrict freedom of speech.
p14
aVWe would never do that in our own countries.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut today, in 2011, if you go and buy a color laser printer
p17
aVfrom any major laser printer manufacturer
p18
aVand print a page,
p19
aVthat page will end up
p20
aVhaving slight yellow dots printed on every single page,
p21
aVin a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer.
p22
aVThis is happening to us today.
p23
aVAnd nobody seems to be making a fuss about it.
p24
aVAnd this is an example
p25
aVof the ways our own governments are using technology
p26
aVagainst us, the citizens.
p27
aVAnd this is one of the main three sources of online problems today.
p28
aa(lp29
VIf we look at what's really happening in the online world,
p30
aVwe can group the attacks based on the attackers.
p31
aVWe have three main groups.
p32
aVWe have online criminals.
p33
aVLike here, we have Mr. Dmitry Golubov,
p34
aVfrom the city of Kiev in Ukraine.
p35
aVAnd the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand.
p36
aVThese guys make money.
p37
aVThey use online attacks to make lots of money \u2014
p38
aVand lots and lots of it.
p39
aVWe actually have several cases of millionaires online, multimillionaires,
p40
aVwho made money with their attacks.
p41
aVHere's Vladimir Tsastsin, from Tartu in Estonia.
p42
aVThis is [Albert] Gonzalez.
p43
aVThis is Stephen Watt.
p44
aVThis is Bjorn Sundin.
p45
aVThis is Matthew Anderson, Tariq Al-Daour
p46
aVand so on and so on.
p47
aa(lp48
VThese guys make their fortunes online,
p49
aVbut they make it through the illegal means
p50
aVof using things like banking Trojans
p51
aVto steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking,
p52
aVor with keyloggers
p53
aVto collect our credit card information
p54
aVwhile we are doing online shopping from an infected computer.
p55
aVThe US Secret Service,
p56
aVtwo months ago, froze the Swiss bank account
p57
aVof Mr. Sam Jain right here,
p58
aVand that bank account had 14.9 million US dollars in it
p59
aVwhen it was frozen.
p60
aVMr. Jain himself is on the loose; nobody knows where he is.
p61
aVAnd I claim it's already today
p62
aVthat it's more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online
p63
aVthan here in the real world.
p64
aVAnd it's very obvious that this is only going to get worse.
p65
aVIn the future, the majority of crime will be happening online.
p66
aa(lp67
VThe second major group of attackers that we are watching today
p68
aVare not motivated by money.
p69
aVThey're motivated by something else \u2014
p70
aVmotivated by protests,
p71
aVmotivated by an opinion,
p72
aVmotivated by the laughs.
p73
aVGroups like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months
p74
aVand have become a major player in the field of online attacks.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo those are the three main attackers:
p77
aVcriminals who do it for the money,
p78
aVhacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest,
p79
aVbut then the last group are nation states \u2014
p80
aVgovernments doing the attacks.
p81
aVAnd then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar.
p82
aVThis is a prime example of what happens when governments attack
p83
aVagainst their own citizens.
p84
aVDigiNotar is a certificate authority from the Netherlands \u2014
p85
aVor actually, it was.
p86
aVIt was running into bankruptcy last fall,
p87
aVbecause they were hacked into.
p88
aVSomebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly.
p89
aVAnd I asked last week,
p90
aVin a meeting with Dutch government representatives,
p91
aVI asked one of the leaders of the team
p92
aVwhether he found plausible that people died
p93
aVbecause of the DigiNotar hack.
p94
aVAnd his answer was: yes.
p95
aa(lp96
VSo how do people die
p97
aVas the result of a hack like this?
p98
aVWell, DigiNotar is a CA.
p99
aVThey sell certificates.
p100
aVWhat do you do with certificates?
p101
aVWell, you need a certificate if you have a website
p102
aVthat has https, SSL encrypted services,
p103
aVservices like Gmail.
p104
aVNow we all, or a big part of us, use Gmail or one of their competitors,
p105
aVbut these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran,
p106
aVwhere dissidents use foreign services like Gmail
p107
aVbecause they know they are more trustworthy than the local services
p108
aVand they are encrypted over SSL connections,
p109
aVso the local government can't snoop on their discussions.
p110
aVExcept they can,
p111
aVif they hack into a foreign CA and issue rogue certificates.
p112
aVAnd this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar.
p113
aa(lp114
VWhat about Arab Spring
p115
aVand things that have been happening, for example, in Egypt?
p116
aVWell, in Egypt,
p117
aVthe rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police
p118
aVin April 2011,
p119
aVand when they were looting the building, they found lots of papers.
p120
aVAmong those papers was this binder entitled, "FinFisher."
p121
aVAnd within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany,
p122
aVwhich had sold to the Egyptian government
p123
aVa set of tools for intercepting, at a very large scale,
p124
aVall the communication of the citizens of the country.
p125
aVThey had sold this tool for 280,000 euros to the Egyptian government.
p126
aVThe company headquarters are right here.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools
p129
aVto do this against their own citizens.
p130
aVBut Western governments are doing it to themselves as well.
p131
aVFor example, in Germany,
p132
aVjust a couple of weeks ago, the so-called "State Trojan" was found,
p133
aVwhich was a Trojan used by German government officials
p134
aVto investigate their own citizens.
p135
aVIf you are a suspect in a criminal case,
p136
aVwell, it's pretty obvious, your phone will be tapped.
p137
aVBut today, it goes beyond that.
p138
aVThey will tap your Internet connection.
p139
aVThey will even use tools like State Trojan
p140
aVto infect your computer with a Trojan,
p141
aVwhich enables them to watch all your communication,
p142
aVto listen to your online discussions,
p143
aVto collect your passwords.
p144
aa(lp145
VNow, when we think deeper about things like these,
p146
aVthe obvious response from people should be,
p147
aV"OK, well, that sounds bad, but that doesn't really affect me,
p148
aVbecause I'm a legal citizen.
p149
aVWhy should I worry? Because I have nothing to hide."
p150
aVAnd this is an argument which doesn't make sense.
p151
aVPrivacy is implied.
p152
aVPrivacy is not up for discussion.
p153
aVThis is not a question
p154
aVbetween privacy
p155
aVagainst security.
p156
aVIt's a question of freedom
p157
aVagainst control.
p158
aVAnd while we might trust our governments right now, right here in 2011,
p159
aVany rights we give away will be given away for good.
p160
aVAnd do we trust, do we blindly trust, any future government,
p161
aVa government we might have 50 years from now?
p162
aVAnd these are the questions
p163
aVthat we have to worry about for the next 50 years.
