VSo I know TED is about a lot of things that are big,
p4
aVbut I want to talk to you about something very small.
p5
aVSo small, it's a single word.
p6
aVThe word is "misfit."
p7
aVIt's one of my favorite words, because it's so literal.
p8
aVI mean, it's a person who sort of missed fitting in.
p9
aVOr a person who fits in badly.
p10
aVOr this: "a person who is poorly adapted
p11
aVto new situations and environments."
p12
aVI'm a card-carrying misfit.
p13
aVAnd I'm here for the other misfits in the room,
p14
aVbecause I'm never the only one.
p15
aVI'm going to tell you a misfit story.
p16
aa(lp17
VSomewhere in my early 30s,
p18
aVthe dream of becoming a writer came right to my doorstep.
p19
aVActually, it came to my mailbox
p20
aVin the form of a letter that said I'd won a giant literary prize
p21
aVfor a short story I had written.
p22
aVThe short story was about my life as a competitive swimmer
p23
aVand about my crappy home life,
p24
aVand a little bit about how grief and loss can make you insane.
p25
aVThe prize was a trip to New York City to meet big-time editors and agents
p26
aVand other authors.
p27
aVSo kind of it was the wannabe writer's dream, right?
p28
aVYou know what I did the day the letter came to my house?
p29
aVBecause I'm me,
p30
aVI put the letter on my kitchen table,
p31
aVI poured myself a giant glass of vodka
p32
aVwith ice and lime,
p33
aVand I sat there in my underwear for an entire day,
p34
aVjust staring at the letter.
p35
aVI was thinking about all the ways I'd already screwed my life up.
p36
aVWho the hell was I to go to New York City
p37
aVand pretend to be a writer?
p38
aVWho was I?
p39
aa(lp40
VI'll tell you.
p41
aVI was a misfit.
p42
aVLike legions of other children,
p43
aVI came from an abusive household
p44
aVthat I narrowly escaped with my life.
p45
aVI already had two epically failed marriages underneath my belt.
p46
aVI'd flunked out of college not once but twice
p47
aVand maybe even a third time that I'm not going to tell you about.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VAnd I'd done an episode of rehab for drug use.
p52
aVAnd I'd had two lovely staycations in jail.
p53
aVSo I'm on the right stage.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VBut the real reason, I think, I was a misfit,
p58
aVis that my daughter died the day she was born,
p59
aVand I hadn't figured out how to live with that story yet.
p60
aVAfter my daughter died I also spent a long time homeless,
p61
aVliving under an overpass
p62
aVin a kind of profound state of zombie grief and loss
p63
aVthat some of us encounter along the way.
p64
aVMaybe all of us, if you live long enough.
p65
aVYou know, homeless people are some of our most heroic misfits,
p66
aVbecause they start out as us.
p67
aVSo you see, I'd missed fitting in to just about every category out there:
p68
aVdaughter, wife, mother, scholar.
p69
aVAnd the dream of being a writer
p70
aVwas really kind of like a small, sad stone in my throat.
p71
aa(lp72
VIt was pretty much in spite of myself that I got on that plane
p73
aVand flew to New York City,
p74
aVwhere the writers are.
p75
aVFellow misfits, I can almost see your heads glowing.
p76
aVI can pick you out of a room.
p77
aVAt first, you would've loved it.
p78
aVYou got to choose the three famous writers you wanted to meet,
p79
aVand these guys went and found them for you.
p80
aVYou got set up at the Gramercy Park Hotel,
p81
aVwhere you got to drink Scotch late in the night
p82
aVwith cool, smart, swank people.
p83
aVAnd you got to pretend you were cool and smart and swank, too.
p84
aVAnd you got to meet a bunch of editors and authors and agents
p85
aVat very, very fancy lunches and dinners.
p86
aVAsk me how fancy.
p87
aa(lp88
VAudience: How fancy?
p89
aa(lp90
VLidia Yuknavitch: I'm making a confession: I stole three linen napkins \u2014
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
Vfrom three different restaurants.
p95
aVAnd I shoved a menu down my pants.
p96
aa(lp97
V(Laughter)
p98
aa(lp99
VI just wanted some keepsakes so that when I got home,
p100
aVI could believe it had really happened to me.
p101
aVYou know?
p102
aa(lp103
VThe three writers I wanted to meet
p104
aVwere Carole Maso, Lynne Tillman and Peggy Phelan.
p105
aVThese were not famous, best-selling authors,
p106
aVbut to me, they were women-writer titans.
p107
aVCarole Maso wrote the book that later became my art bible.
p108
aVLynne Tillman gave me permission to believe
p109
aVthat there was a chance my stories could be part of the world.
p110
aVAnd Peggy Phelan reminded me
p111
aVthat maybe my brains could be more important than my boobs.
p112
aVThey weren't mainstream women writers,
p113
aVbut they were cutting a path through the mainstream
p114
aVwith their body stories,
p115
aVI like to think, kind of the way water cut the Grand Canyon.
p116
aa(lp117
VIt nearly killed me with joy
p118
aVto hang out with these three over-50-year-old women writers.
p119
aVAnd the reason it nearly killed me with joy
p120
aVis that I'd never known a joy like that.
p121
aVI'd never been in a room like that.
p122
aVMy mother never went to college.
p123
aVAnd my creative career to that point
p124
aVwas a sort of small, sad, stillborn thing.
p125
aVSo kind of in those first nights in New York I wanted to die there.
p126
aVI was just like, "Kill me now. I'm good. This is beautiful."
p127
aVSome of you in the room will understand what happened next.
p128
aa(lp129
VFirst, they took me to the offices of Farrar, Straus and Giroux.
p130
aVFarrar, Straus and Giroux was like my mega-dream press.
p131
aVI mean, T.S. Eliot and Flannery O'Connor were published there.
p132
aVThe main editor guy sat me down and talked to me for a long time,
p133
aVtrying to convince me I had a book in me
p134
aVabout my life as a swimmer.
p135
aVYou know, like a memoir.
p136
aVThe whole time he was talking to me,
p137
aVI sat there smiling and nodding like a numb idiot,
p138
aVwith my arms crossed over my chest,
p139
aVwhile nothing, nothing, nothing came out of my throat.
p140
aVSo in the end, he patted me on the shoulder
p141
aVlike a swim coach might.
p142
aVAnd he wished me luck
p143
aVand he gave me some free books
p144
aVand he showed me out the door.
p145
aa(lp146
VNext, they took me to the offices of W.W. Norton,
p147
aVwhere I was pretty sure I'd be escorted from the building
p148
aVjust for wearing Doc Martens.
p149
aVBut that didn't happen.
p150
aVBeing at the Norton offices
p151
aVfelt like reaching up into the night sky and touching the moon
p152
aVwhile the stars stitched your name across the cosmos.
p153
aVI mean, that's how big a deal it was to me.
p154
aVYou get it?
p155
aVTheir lead editor, Carol Houck Smith,
p156
aVleaned over right in my face with these beady, bright, fierce eyes
p157
aVand said, "Well, send me something then, immediately!"
p158
aVSee, now most people, especially TED people,
p159
aVwould have run to the mailbox, right?
p160
aVIt took me over a decade to even imagine
p161
aVputting something in an envelope and licking a stamp.
p162
aa(lp163
VOn the last night,
p164
aVI gave a big reading at the National Poetry Club.
p165
aVAnd at the end of the reading,
p166
aVKatharine Kidde of Kidde, Hoyt & Picard Literary Agency,
p167
aVwalked straight up to me and shook my hand
p168
aVand offered me representation, like, on the spot.
p169
aVI stood there and I kind of went deaf.
p170
aVHas this ever happened to you?
p171
aVAnd I almost started crying
p172
aVbecause all the people in the room were dressed so beautifully,
p173
aVand all that came out of my mouth was:
p174
aV"I don't know. I have to think about it."
p175
aVAnd she said, "OK, then," and walked away.
p176
aVAll those open hands out to me, that small, sad stone in my throat ...
p177
aa(lp178
VYou see, I'm trying to tell you something about people like me.
p179
aVMisfit people \u2014 we don't always know how to hope or say yes
p180
aVor choose the big thing,
p181
aVeven when it's right in front of us.
p182
aVIt's a shame we carry.
p183
aVIt's the shame of wanting something good.
p184
aVIt's the shame of feeling something good.
p185
aVIt's the shame of not really believing we deserve to be in the room
p186
aVwith the people we admire.
p187
aa(lp188
VIf I could, I'd go back and I'd coach myself.
p189
aVI'd be exactly like those over-50-year-old women who helped me.
p190
aVI'd teach myself how to want things,
p191
aVhow to stand up, how to ask for them.
p192
aVI'd say, "You! Yeah, you! You belong in the room, too."
p193
aVThe radiance falls on all of us,
p194
aVand we are nothing without each other.
p195
aVInstead, I flew back to Oregon,
p196
aVand as I watched the evergreens and rain come back into view,
p197
aVI just drank many tiny bottles of airplane "feel sorry for yourself."
p198
aVI thought about how, if I was a writer, I was some kind of misfit writer.
p199
aVWhat I'm saying is,
p200
aVI flew back to Oregon without a book deal,
p201
aVwithout an agent,
p202
aVand with only a headful and heart-ful of memories
p203
aVof having sat so near
p204
aVthe beautiful writers.
p205
aVMemory was the only prize I allowed myself.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd yet, at home in the dark,
p208
aVback in my underwear,
p209
aVI could still hear their voices.
p210
aVThey said, "Don't listen to anyone who tries to get you to shut up
p211
aVor change your story."
p212
aVThey said, "Give voice to the story only you know how to tell."
p213
aVThey said, "Sometimes telling the story
p214
aVis the thing that saves your life."
p215
aa(lp216
VNow I am, as you can see, the woman over 50.
p217
aVAnd I'm a writer.
p218
aVAnd I'm a mother.
p219
aVAnd I became a teacher.
p220
aVGuess who my favorite students are.
p221
aVAlthough it didn't happen the day
p222
aVthat dream letter came through my mailbox,
p223
aVI did write a memoir,
p224
aVcalled "The Chronology of Water."
p225
aVIn it are the stories of how many times I've had to reinvent a self
p226
aVfrom the ruins of my choices,
p227
aVthe stories of how my seeming failures were really just weird-ass portals
p228
aVto something beautiful.
p229
aVAll I had to do was give voice to the story.
p230
aa(lp231
VThere's a myth in most cultures about following your dreams.
p232
aVIt's called the hero's journey.
p233
aVBut I prefer a different myth,
p234
aVthat's slightly to the side of that
p235
aVor underneath it.
p236
aVIt's called the misfit's myth.
p237
aVAnd it goes like this:
p238
aVeven at the moment of your failure,
p239
aVright then, you are beautiful.
p240
aVYou don't know it yet,
p241
aVbut you have the ability to reinvent yourself
p242
aVendlessly.
p243
aVThat's your beauty.
p244
aa(lp245
VYou can be a drunk,
p246
aVyou can be a survivor of abuse,
p247
aVyou can be an ex-con,
p248
aVyou can be a homeless person,
p249
aVyou can lose all your money or your job or your husband
p250
aVor your wife, or the worst thing of all,
p251
aVa child.
p252
aVYou can even lose your marbles.
p253
aVYou can be standing dead center in the middle of your failure
p254
aVand still, I'm only here to tell you,
p255
aVyou are so beautiful.
p256
aVYour story deserves to be heard,
p257
aVbecause you, you rare and phenomenal misfit,
p258
aVyou new species,
p259
aVare the only one in the room
p260
aVwho can tell the story
p261
aVthe way only you would.
p262
aVAnd I'd be listening.
p263
aa(lp264
VThank you.
