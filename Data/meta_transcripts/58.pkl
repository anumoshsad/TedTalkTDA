VI'm the luckiest guy in the world.
p4
aVI got to see the last case of killer smallpox in the world.
p5
aVI was in India this past year,
p6
aVand I may have seen the last cases of polio in the world.
p7
aVThere's nothing that makes you feel more \u2014
p8
aVthe blessing and the honor of working in a program like that \u2014
p9
aVthan to know that something that horrible no longer exists.
p10
aVSo I'm going to tell you \u2014
p11
aV(Applause)
p12
aVso I'm going to show you some dirty pictures.
p13
aVThey are difficult to watch, but you should look at them with optimism,
p14
aVbecause the horror of these pictures will be matched
p15
aVby the uplifting quality of knowing that they no longer exist.
p16
aa(lp17
VBut first, I'm going to tell you a little bit about my own journey.
p18
aVMy background is not exactly the conventional medical education
p19
aVthat you might expect.
p20
aVWhen I was an intern in San Francisco,
p21
aVI heard about a group of Native Americans who had taken over Alcatraz Island,
p22
aVand a Native American who wanted to give birth on that island,
p23
aVand no other doctor wanted to go and help her give birth.
p24
aVI went out to Alcatraz, and I lived on the island for several weeks.
p25
aVShe gave birth; I caught the baby; I got off the island;
p26
aVI landed in San Francisco;
p27
aVand all the press wanted to talk to me,
p28
aVbecause my three weeks on the island made me an expert in Indian affairs.
p29
aV(Laughter)
p30
aa(lp31
VI wound up on every television show.
p32
aVSomeone saw me on television; they called me up; and they asked me
p33
aVif I'd like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor
p34
aVfor a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ride
p35
aVfrom San Francisco to England.
p36
aVAnd I said, yes, I would do that,
p37
aVso I became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie
p38
aVcalled "Medicine Ball Caravan."
p39
aV(Laughter)
p40
aVNow, you know from the '60s,
p41
aVyou're either on the bus or you're off the bus; I was on the bus.
p42
aVMy wife of 37 years and I joined the bus.
p43
aVOur bus ride took us from San Francisco to London,
p44
aVthen we switched buses at the big pond.
p45
aVWe then got on two more buses
p46
aVand we drove through Turkey and Iran, Afghanistan,
p47
aVover the Khyber Pass into Pakistan, like every other young doctor.
p48
aVThis is us at the Khyber Pass, and that's our bus.
p49
aVWe had some difficulty getting over the Khyber Pass.
p50
aVBut we wound up in India.
p51
aVAnd then, like everyone else in our generation,
p52
aVwe went to live in a Himalayan monastery.
p53
aa(lp54
V(Laughter)
p55
aa(lp56
VThis is just like a residency program,
p57
aVfor those of you that are in medical school.
p58
aV(Laughter)
p59
aVAnd we studied with a wise man, a guru named Karoli Baba,
p60
aVwho then told me to get rid of the dress,
p61
aVput on a three-piece suit,
p62
aVgo join the United Nations as a diplomat
p63
aVand work for the World Health Organization.
p64
aVAnd he made an outrageous prediction that smallpox would be eradicated,
p65
aVand that this was God's gift to humanity,
p66
aVbecause of the hard work of dedicated scientists.
p67
aVAnd that prediction came true.
p68
aVThis little girl is Rahima Banu,
p69
aVand she was the last case of killer smallpox in the world.
p70
aVAnd this document is the certificate that the global commission signed,
p71
aVcertifying the world to have eradicated the first disease in history.
p72
aa(lp73
VThe key to eradicating smallpox was early detection, early response.
p74
aVI'm going to ask you to repeat that: early detection, early response.
p75
aVCan you say that?
p76
aa(lp77
VAudience: Early detection, early response.
p78
aa(lp79
VLarry Brilliant: Smallpox was the worst disease in history.
p80
aVIt killed more people than all the wars in history.
p81
aVIn the last century, it killed 500 million people.
p82
aVYou're reading about Larry Page already.
p83
aVSomebody reads very fast.
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aVIn the year that Larry Page and Sergey Brin \u2014
p86
aVwith whom I have a certain affection and a new affiliation \u2014
p87
aVin the year in which they were born,
p88
aVtwo million people died of smallpox.
p89
aVWe declared smallpox eradicated in 1980.
p90
aVThis is the most important slide that I've ever seen in public health,
p91
aV[Sovereigns killed by smallpox] because it shows you
p92
aVto be the richest and the strongest,
p93
aVand to be kings and queens of the world,
p94
aVdid not protect you from dying of smallpox.
p95
aVNever can you doubt that we are all in this together.
p96
aa(lp97
VBut to see smallpox from the perspective of a sovereign
p98
aVis the wrong perspective.
p99
aVYou should see it from the perspective of a mother,
p100
aVwatching her child develop this disease and standing by helplessly.
p101
aVDay one, day two, day three,
p102
aVday four, day five, day six.
p103
aVYou're a mother and you're watching your child,
p104
aVand on day six, you see pustules that become hard.
p105
aVDay seven, they show the classic scars of smallpox umbilication.
p106
aVDay eight.
p107
aa(lp108
VAnd Al Gore said earlier
p109
aVthat the most photographed image in the world,
p110
aVthe most printed image in the world,
p111
aVwas that of the Earth.
p112
aVBut this was in 1974, and as of that moment,
p113
aVthis photograph was the photograph that was the most widely printed,
p114
aVbecause we printed two billion copies of this photograph,
p115
aVand we took them hand to hand, door to door,
p116
aVto show people and ask them if there was smallpox in their house,
p117
aVbecause that was our surveillance system.
p118
aVWe didn't have Google, we didn't have web crawlers,
p119
aVwe didn't have computers.
p120
aa(lp121
VBy day nine \u2014 you look at this picture and you're horrified;
p122
aVI look at this picture and I say, "Thank God,"
p123
aVbecause it's clear that this is only an ordinary case of smallpox,
p124
aVand I know this child will live.
p125
aVAnd by day 13, the lesions are scabbing, his eyelids are swollen,
p126
aVbut you know this child has no other secondary infection.
p127
aVAnd by day 20, while he will be scarred for life, he will live.
p128
aa(lp129
VThere are other kinds of smallpox that are not like that.
p130
aVThis is confluent smallpox,
p131
aVin which there isn't a single place on the body where you could put a finger
p132
aVand not be covered by lesions.
p133
aVFlat smallpox, which killed 100 percent of people who got it.
p134
aVAnd hemorrhagic smallpox, the most cruel of all,
p135
aVwhich had a predilection for pregnant women.
p136
aVI've probably had 50 women die.
p137
aVThey all had hemorrhagic smallpox.
p138
aVI've never seen anybody die from it who wasn't a pregnant woman.
p139
aa(lp140
VIn 1967, the WHO embarked on what was an outrageous program
p141
aVto eradicate a disease.
p142
aVIn that year, there were 34 countries affected with smallpox.
p143
aVBy 1970, we were down to 18 countries.
p144
aV1974, we were down to five countries.
p145
aVBut in that year, smallpox exploded throughout India.
p146
aVAnd India was the place where smallpox made its last stand.
p147
aVIn 1974, India had a population of 600 million.
p148
aVThere are 21 linguistic states in India,
p149
aVwhich is like saying 21 different countries.
p150
aVThere are 20 million people on the road at any time,
p151
aVin buses and trains, walking; 500,000 villages, 120 million households,
p152
aVand none of them wanted to report
p153
aVif they had a case of smallpox in their house,
p154
aVbecause they thought that smallpox was the visitation of a deity,
p155
aVShitala Mata, the cooling mother,
p156
aVand it was wrong to bring strangers into your house
p157
aVwhen the deity was in the house.
p158
aVNo incentive to report smallpox.
p159
aa(lp160
VIt wasn't just India that had smallpox deities;
p161
aVsmallpox deities were prevalent all over the world.
p162
aVSo, how we eradicated smallpox was \u2014
p163
aVmass vaccination wouldn't work.
p164
aVYou could vaccinate everybody in India,
p165
aVbut one year later there'd be 21 million new babies,
p166
aVwhich was then the population of Canada.
p167
aVIt wouldn't do just to vaccinate everyone.
p168
aVYou had to find every single case of smallpox in the world
p169
aVat the same time, and draw a circle of immunity around it.
p170
aVAnd that's what we did.
p171
aVIn India alone, my 150,000 best friends and I went door to door,
p172
aVwith that same picture,
p173
aVto every single house in India.
p174
aVWe made over one billion house calls.
p175
aa(lp176
VAnd in the process, I learned something very important.
p177
aVEvery time we did a house-to-house search,
p178
aVwe had a spike in the number of reports of smallpox.
p179
aVWhen we didn't search, we had the illusion that there was no disease.
p180
aVWhen we did search, we had the illusion that there was more disease.
p181
aVA surveillance system was necessary,
p182
aVbecause what we needed was early detection, early response.
p183
aVSo we searched and we searched,
p184
aVand we found every case of smallpox in India.
p185
aVWe had a reward. We raised the reward.
p186
aVWe continued to increase the reward.
p187
aVWe had a scorecard that we wrote on every house.
p188
aVAnd as we did that,
p189
aVthe number of reported cases in the world dropped to zero.
p190
aVAnd in 1980, we declared the globe free of smallpox.
p191
aa(lp192
VIt was the largest campaign in United Nations history,
p193
aVuntil the Iraq war.
p194
aV150,000 people from all over the world \u2014
p195
aVdoctors of every race, religion, culture and nation,
p196
aVwho fought side by side, brothers and sisters,
p197
aVwith each other, not against each other,
p198
aVin a common cause to make the world better.
p199
aVBut smallpox was the fourth disease that was intended for eradication.
p200
aVWe failed three other times.
p201
aVWe failed against malaria, yellow fever and yaws.
p202
aVBut soon we may see polio eradicated.
p203
aVBut the key to eradicating polio is early detection, early response.
p204
aVThis may be the year we eradicate polio.
p205
aVThat will make it the second disease in history.
p206
aVAnd David Heymann, who's watching this on the webcast \u2014
p207
aVDavid, keep on going. We're close!
p208
aVWe're down to four countries.
p209
aa(lp210
V(Applause)
p211
aa(lp212
VI feel like Hank Aaron.
p213
aVBarry Bonds can replace me any time.
p214
aa(lp215
VLet's get another disease off the list of terrible things to worry about.
p216
aVI was just in India working on the polio program.
p217
aVThe polio surveillance program is four million people going door to door.
p218
aVThat is the surveillance system.
p219
aVBut we need to have early detection, early response.
p220
aVBlindness, the same thing.
p221
aVThe key to discovering blindness is doing epidemiological surveys
p222
aVand finding out the causes of blindness,
p223
aVso you can mount the correct response.
p224
aa(lp225
VThe Seva Foundation was started by a group of alumni
p226
aVof the Smallpox Eradication Programme,
p227
aVwho, having climbed the highest mountain,
p228
aVtasted the elixir of the success of eradicating a disease,
p229
aVwanted to do it again.
p230
aVAnd over the last 27 years, Seva's programs in 15 countries
p231
aVhave given back sight to more than two million blind people.
p232
aVSeva got started because we wanted to apply these lessons
p233
aVof surveillance and epidemiology
p234
aVto something which nobody else was looking at as a public health issue:
p235
aVblindness, which heretofore had been thought of only as a clinical disease.
p236
aa(lp237
VIn 1980, Steve Jobs gave me that computer, which is Apple number 12,
p238
aVand it's still in Kathmandu, and it's still working,
p239
aVand we ought to go get it and auction it off and make more money for Seva.
p240
aVAnd we conducted the first Nepal survey ever done for health,
p241
aVand the first nationwide blindness survey ever done,
p242
aVand we had astonishing results.
p243
aVInstead of finding out what we thought was the case \u2014
p244
aVthat blindness was caused mostly by glaucoma and trachoma \u2014
p245
aVwe were astounded to find out
p246
aVthat blindness was caused instead by cataract.
p247
aVYou can't cure or prevent what you don't know is there.
p248
aa(lp249
VIn your TED packages there's a DVD, "Infinite Vision,"
p250
aVabout Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital.
p251
aVI hope that you will take a look at it.
p252
aVAravind, which started as a Seva project,
p253
aVis now the world's largest and best eye hospital.
p254
aVThis year, that one hospital will give back sight
p255
aVto more than 300,000 people in Tamil Nadu, India.
p256
aV(Applause)
p257
aVBird flu.
p258
aVI stand here as a representative of all terrible things \u2014
p259
aVthis might be the worst.
p260
aVThe key to preventing or mitigating pandemic bird flu
p261
aVis early detection and rapid response.
p262
aVWe will not have a vaccine or adequate supplies of an antiviral
p263
aVto combat bird flu if it occurs in the next three years.
p264
aVWHO stages the progress of a pandemic.
p265
aVWe are now at stage three on the pandemic alert stage,
p266
aVwith just a little bit of human-to-human transmission,
p267
aVbut no human-to-human-to-human sustained transmission.
p268
aa(lp269
VThe moment WHO says we've moved to category four \u2014
p270
aVthis will not be like Katrina.
p271
aVThe world as we know it will stop.
p272
aVThere'll be no airplanes flying.
p273
aVWould you get in an airplane with 250 people you didn't know,
p274
aVcoughing and sneezing,
p275
aVwhen you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you,
p276
aVfor which you had no antivirals or vaccine?
p277
aVI did a study of the top epidemiologists in the world in October.
p278
aVI asked them \u2014 these are all fluologists and specialists in influenza \u2014
p279
aVand I asked them the questions you'd like to ask them:
p280
aVWhat do you think the likelihood is that there'll be a pandemic?
p281
aVIf it happens, how bad do you think it will be?
p282
aa(lp283
VFifteen percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within three years.
p284
aVBut much worse than that,
p285
aV90 percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic
p286
aVwithin your children or your grandchildren's lifetime.
p287
aVAnd they thought that if there was a pandemic,
p288
aVa billion people would get sick.
p289
aVAs many as 165 million people would die.
p290
aVThere would be a global recession and depression
p291
aVas our just-in-time inventory system
p292
aVand the tight rubber band of globalization broke,
p293
aVand the cost to our economy of one to three trillion dollars
p294
aVwould be far worse for everyone than merely 100 million people dying,
p295
aVbecause so many more people would lose their job
p296
aVand their healthcare benefits,
p297
aVthat the consequences are almost unthinkable.
p298
aVAnd it's getting worse, because travel is getting so much better.
p299
aa(lp300
VLet me show you a simulation of what a pandemic looks like.
p301
aVSo we know what we're talking about.
p302
aVLet's assume, for example, that the first case occurs in South Asia.
p303
aVIt initially goes quite slowly.
p304
aVYou get two or three discrete locations.
p305
aVThen there'll be secondary outbreaks, and the disease will spread
p306
aVfrom country to country so fast that you won't know what hit you.
p307
aVWithin three weeks it will be everywhere in the world.
p308
aVNow, if we had an "undo" button, and we could go back and isolate it
p309
aVand grab it when it first started \u2014 if we could find it early,
p310
aVand we had early detection and early response,
p311
aVand we could put each one of those viruses in jail \u2014
p312
aVthat's the only way to deal with something like a pandemic.
p313
aVAnd let me show you why that is.
p314
aa(lp315
VWe have a joke.
p316
aVThis is an epidemic curve, and everyone in medicine,
p317
aVI think, ultimately gets to know what it is.
p318
aVBut the joke is,
p319
aVan epidemiologist likes to arrive at an epidemic right here
p320
aVand ride to glory on the downhill curve.
p321
aV(Laughter)
p322
aVBut you don't get to do that usually.
p323
aVYou usually arrive right about here.
p324
aVWhat we really want is to arrive right here, so we can stop the epidemic.
p325
aVBut you can't always do that.
p326
aVBut there's an organization that has been able to find a way
p327
aVto learn when the first cases occur,
p328
aVand that is called GPHIN;
p329
aVit's the Global Public Health Information Network.
p330
aVAnd that simulation that I showed you
p331
aVthat you thought was bird flu \u2014 that was SARS.
p332
aVAnd SARS is the pandemic that did not occur.
p333
aVAnd it didn't occur
p334
aVbecause GPHIN found the pandemic-to-be of SARS
p335
aVthree months before WHO actually announced it, and because of that,
p336
aVwe were able to stop the SARS pandemic.
p337
aVAnd I think we owe a great debt of gratitude
p338
aVto GPHIN and to Ron St. John,
p339
aVwho I hope is in the audience some place \u2014 over there \u2014
p340
aVwho's the founder of GPHIN.
p341
aa(lp342
V(Applause)
p343
aa(lp344
VHello, Ron!
p345
aa(lp346
V(Applause)
p347
aa(lp348
VAnd TED has flown Ron here from Ottawa, where GPHIN is located,
p349
aVbecause not only did GPHIN find SARS early,
p350
aVbut you may have seen last week
p351
aVthat Iran announced that they had bird flu in Iran,
p352
aVbut GPHIN found the bird flu in Iran not February 14 \u2014
p353
aVbut last September.
p354
aVWe need an early-warning system
p355
aVto protect us against the things that are humanity's worst nightmare.
p356
aVAnd so my TED wish is based on the common denominator
p357
aVof these experiences.
p358
aVSmallpox \u2014 early detection, early response.
p359
aVBlindness, polio \u2014 early detection, early response.
p360
aVPandemic bird flu \u2014 early detection, early response.
p361
aVIt is a litany.
p362
aVIt is so obvious that our only way of dealing with these new diseases
p363
aVis to find them early and to kill them before they spread.
p364
aa(lp365
VSo, my TED wish is for you to help build a global system \u2014
p366
aVan early-warning system \u2014
p367
aVto protect us against humanity's worst nightmares.
p368
aVAnd what I thought I would call it is "Early Detection,"
p369
aVBut it should really be called ...
p370
aV"Total Early Detection." [TED]
p371
aa(lp372
V(Laughter)
p373
aVWhat?
p374
aa(lp375
V(Applause)
p376
aVWhat?
p377
aV(Applause)
p378
aa(lp379
VBut in all seriousness,
p380
aVbecause this idea is birthed in TED,
p381
aVI would like it to be a legacy of TED, and I'd like to call it
p382
aVthe "International System for Total Early Disease Detection."
p383
aV[INSTEDD]
p384
aVAnd INSTEDD then becomes our mantra.
p385
aVSo instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu,
p386
aVwe find it and immediately contain it.
p387
aVInstead of a novel virus caused by bio-terror or bio-error,
p388
aVor shift or drift, we find it and we contain it.
p389
aVInstead of industrial accidents like oil spills
p390
aVor the catastrophe in Bhopal,
p391
aVwe find them, and we respond to them.
p392
aVInstead of famine, hidden until it is too late,
p393
aVwe detect it, and we respond.
p394
aVAnd instead of a system which is owned by a government,
p395
aVand hidden in the bowels of government,
p396
aVlet's build an early detection system
p397
aVthat's freely available to anyone in the world in their own language.
p398
aa(lp399
VLet's make it transparent, non-governmental,
p400
aVnot owned by any single country or company,
p401
aVhoused in a neutral country, with redundant backup
p402
aVin a different time zone and a different continent.
p403
aVAnd let's build it on GPHIN.
p404
aVLet's start with GPHIN.
p405
aVLet's increase the websites that they crawl
p406
aVfrom 20,000 to 20 million.
p407
aVLet's increase the languages they crawl
p408
aVfrom seven to 70, or more.
p409
aVLet's build in outbound confirmation messages,
p410
aVusing text messages or SMS or instant messaging
p411
aVto find out from people who are within 100 meters
p412
aVof the rumor that you hear,
p413
aVif it is, in fact, valid.
p414
aVAnd let's add satellite confirmation.
p415
aVAnd we'll add Gapminder's amazing graphics to the front end.
p416
aa(lp417
VAnd we'll grow it as a moral force in the world,
p418
aVfinding out those terrible things
p419
aVbefore anybody else knows about them,
p420
aVand sending our response to them,
p421
aVso that next year, instead of us meeting here,
p422
aVlamenting how many terrible things there are in the world,
p423
aVwe will have pulled together,
p424
aVused the unique skills and the magic of this community,
p425
aVand be proud that we have done everything we can to stop pandemics,
p426
aVother catastrophes, and change the world, beginning right now.
p427

VChris Anderson: An amazing presentation.
p431
aVFirst of all, just so everyone understands:
p432
aVyou're saying that by creating web crawlers,
p433
aVlooking on the Internet for patterns,
p434
aVthey can detect something suspicious
p435
aVbefore WHO, before anyone else can see it?
p436
aVGive an example of how that could possibly be true.

VLB: Well, as Ron St. John \u2014
p445
aVI hope you'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him.
p446
aVWhen he started GPHIN \u2014
p447
aVIn 1997, there was an outbreak of bird flu \u2014 H5N1.
p448
aVIt was in Hong Kong.
p449
aVAnd a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong responded immediately,
p450
aVby slaughtering 1.5 million chickens and birds,
p451
aVand they stopped that outbreak in its tracks.
p452
aVImmediate detection, immediate response.
p453
aVThen a number of years went by,
p454
aVand there were a lot of rumors about bird flu.
p455
aVRon and his team in Ottawa began to crawl the web \u2014
p456
aVonly crawling 20,000 different websites, mostly periodicals \u2014
p457
aVand they read about and heard about a concern,
p458
aVof a lot of children who had high fever and symptoms of bird flu.
p459
aa(lp460
VThey reported this to WHO.
p461
aa(lp462
VWHO took a little while taking action,
p463
aVbecause WHO will only receive a report from a government,
p464
aVbecause it's the United Nations.
p465
aVBut they were able to point to WHO and let them know
p466
aVthat there was this surprising and unexplained cluster of illnesses
p467
aVthat looked like bird flu.
p468
aVThat turned out to be SARS.
p469
aVThat's how the world found out about SARS.
p470
aVAnd because of that, we were able to stop SARS.
p471
aVNow, what's really important is that, before there was GPHIN,
p472
aV100 percent of all the world's reports of bad things \u2014
p473
aVwhether you're talking about famine
p474
aVor you're talking about bird flu or you're talking about Ebola \u2014
p475
aV100 percent of all those reports came from nations.
p476
aa(lp477
VThe moment these guys in Ottawa \u2014
p478
aVon a budget of 800,000 dollars a year \u2014 got cracking,
p479
aV75 percent of all the reports in the world came from GPHIN,
p480
aV25 percent of all the reports in the world
p481
aVcame from all the other 180 nations.
p482
aVNow, here's what's really interesting:
p483
aVafter they'd been working for a couple years,
p484
aVwhat do you think happened to those nations?
p485
aVThey felt pretty stupid.
p486
aVSo they started sending in their reports early.
p487
aVAnd now, their reporting percentage is down to 50 percent,
p488
aVbecause other nations have started to report.
p489
aVSo, can you find diseases early by crawling the web?
p490
aVOf course you can.
p491
aVCan you find it even earlier than GPHIN does now?
p492
aVOf course you can.
p493
aVYou saw that they found SARS using their Chinese web crawler
p494
aVa full six weeks before they found it using their English web crawler.
p495
aVWell, they're only crawling in seven languages.
p496
aVThese bad viruses really don't have any intention
p497
aVof showing up first in English or Spanish or French.
p498
aa(lp499
V(Laughter)
p500
aa(lp501
VSo yes, I want to take GPHIN, I want to build on it.
p502
aVI want to add all the languages of the world that we possibly can.
p503
aVI want to make this open to everybody,
p504
aVso that the health officer in Nairobi or in Patna, Bihar
p505
aVwill have as much access to it as the folks in Ottawa or in CDC.
p506
aVAnd I want to make it part of our culture
p507
aVthat there is a community of people who are watching out
p508
aVfor the worst nightmares of humanity,
p509
aVand that it's accessible to everyone.
