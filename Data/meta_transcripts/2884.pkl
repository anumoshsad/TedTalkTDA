VWe live in a time of fear,
p4
aVand our response to fear can either be to contract
p5
aVand attempt to guard ourselves
p6
aVor to extend ourselves, hold on to each other,
p7
aVand face our fears together.
p8
aVWhat is your instinct?
p9
aVWhat do you see more of in the world?
p10
aa(lp11
VThe problem with the first approach
p12
aVis that in our mounting isolation,
p13
aVwe divide ourselves from others.
p14
aVOur sense of isolation grows,
p15
aVbecause our imagination goes into overdrive
p16
aVabout the people and the spaces that we no longer engage with.
p17
aVOur sense of otherness grows, and we lose empathy.
p18
aVToday I'm going to tell you about a group of people
p19
aVthat took the global challenge of terrorism
p20
aVand began creating spaces where strangers connect in solidarity.
p21
aa(lp22
VMy own obsession with what I see as irrational divisions began as a child.
p23
aVAs a fourth-generation Kenyan Muslim of Indian origin,
p24
aVit bothered me that in four generations,
p25
aVthere wasn't a single marriage in my family
p26
aVoutside of my small religious community.
p27
aVAnd I wondered what that was about.
p28
aVWas it fear?
p29
aVWas it racism?
p30
aVWas it cultural preservation?
p31
aVDid it have something to do with colonialism?
p32
aVCertainly, we didn't share a lot of the same public spaces with others.
p33
aa(lp34
VThese divisions bothered me deeply, and they drove my career choices.
p35
aVWhen I was 20, the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed.
p36
aVA year later, I was on my way to the Middle East
p37
aVto study conflict resolution.
p38
aVAnd then from that point on,
p39
aVit wasn't very hard for me to find insecure environments to work in,
p40
aVbecause the world was quickly shifting
p41
aVin what we now know as the time of terrorism.
p42
aVI was in Washington, DC when 9/11 happened,
p43
aVand then I moved back home to Kenya to work with refugees
p44
aVand then later worked in Pakistan
p45
aVand in Afghanistan.
p46
aVIn all of these places, what I noticed
p47
aVwas how important physical spaces are
p48
aVto making us feel safe
p49
aVand well
p50
aVand like we belong.
p51
aa(lp52
VIn 2013, I came back home to Nairobi from Afghanistan.
p53
aVAl-Shabaab operatives had besieged Westgate shopping center,
p54
aVkilling 67 people in a day of utter horror.
p55
aVSoon after that,
p56
aVI could see how Nairobi was beginning to change,
p57
aVand it was beginning to feel more like the fear and terror-weary
p58
aVand war-torn cities that I had worked in.
p59
aVAnd Nairobi continues to grow in fear-driven ways.
p60
aVWe see more walls, more barriers,
p61
aVmore security.
p62
aVAnd like other parts of the world,
p63
aVwe are experiencing an erosion of human connection.
p64
aVDivisions along religious lines are deepening,
p65
aVand we're doubting more and more how much we have in common.
p66
aVWe are at a pivotal time
p67
aVwhen we need to restore our confidence in humanity
p68
aVand stand boldly and visibly together.
p69
aa(lp70
VSo in 2014, I brought together a group of people in Nairobi
p71
aVto figure out what to do:
p72
aVpublic intellectuals, diplomats, artists, development workers.
p73
aVAnd the group articulated our challenge as threefold:
p74
aVone, to reclaim the city from the narrative of terrorism
p75
aVand back into the hands of the people that live there;
p76
aVtwo, introduce a language beyond race, tribe or religion
p77
aVthat would help us transcend our differences;
p78
aVand three, provide a gesture that would help restore empathy
p79
aVand conversation and trust.
p80
aa(lp81
VOne of the people in this group was an artist and architect,
p82
aVYazmany Arboleda.
p83
aVHe and I have collaborated in other parts of the world
p84
aVover many years.
p85
aVHe has a history
p86
aVof disrupting urban environments
p87
aVand making strangers connect
p88
aVin incredible, beautiful and spectacular ways.
p89
aVHe had an idea.
p90
aVThe idea was to unite people of different faiths
p91
aVby getting them to paint each other's houses of worship,
p92
aVmosques, temples, synagogues, churches,
p93
aVpaint them yellow
p94
aVin the name of love.
p95
aa(lp96
VBy focusing on icons of faith,
p97
aVwe would get people to reexamine the true essence of their faith,
p98
aVthe common belief that we share in kindness, generosity and friendship.
p99
aVBy creating pathways between houses of worship
p100
aVwithin one neighborhood,
p101
aVwe would create islands of stability
p102
aVand networks of people
p103
aVthat could withstand threats.
p104
aVAnd neighbors, by picking up a paintbrush with other neighbors,
p105
aVwould engage not just with their heads
p106
aVbut with their hands and with their hearts.
p107
aVAnd the painted buildings would become sculptures in the landscape
p108
aVthat speak of people from very different backgrounds
p109
aVthat stand together.
p110
aa(lp111
VWe'd call the project "Colour in Faith."
p112
aVWe loved the idea and we immediately began approaching houses of worship:
p113
aVchurches, temples, mosques, synagogues.
p114
aVDoor to door, we went to more than 60 rabbis,
p115
aVimams, pastors and priests.
p116
aVAs you can imagine,
p117
aVbringing these communities together
p118
aVwhen prejudices are reinforced by a global pandemic of fear
p119
aVis not easy.
p120
aVIt was complicated.
p121
aVWe were confronted with the hierarchy of decision-making
p122
aVwithin religious establishments.
p123
aVFor example, with Catholic churches,
p124
aVwe were told that the archbishop would have to make the decision.
p125
aVAnd so we wrote a letter to the archbishop.
p126
aVWe wrote a letter to the Vatican.
p127
aVWe're still waiting to hear back.
p128
aa(lp129
V(Laughter)
p130
aa(lp131
VAnd with other houses of worship,
p132
aVwe were told that the patrons, the people that pay for the building
p133
aVand the construction and the painting of the buildings
p134
aVwould have to make a decision.
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd then we came head-to-head
p137
aVwith the long legacy of missionary and donor dependence
p138
aVthat so impedes unconditional civic action,
p139
aVand we learned this the hard way.
p140
aVThere was one community
p141
aVthat in our repeated conversations would keep asking us
p142
aVto appreciate them.
p143
aVAnd so we would keep going back
p144
aVand telling them that we appreciate them,
p145
aVand of course,
p146
aVif we didn't appreciate them, we wouldn't be here.
p147
aVAnd then we learned painfully late in the game
p148
aVthat the word "appreciation" is code for getting paid to participate.
p149
aVAnd so we challenged them
p150
aVand we asked the question,
p151
aV"So what will it cost?
p152
aVHow much could we pay you?
p153
aVAnd if we pay for your faith, is it really faith?"
p154
aVWe started the project asking the question,
p155
aV"Where does your faith live?"
p156
aVAnd here we found ourselves asking the question,
p157
aV"How much does your faith cost?"
p158
aa(lp159
VBut the most difficult issue was the perceived risk of standing apart.
p160
aVWe had one synagogue that flat-out refused to participate
p161
aVbecause it feared drawing attention to itself
p162
aVand becoming a target.
p163
aVSimilarly, we had a mosque that also feared becoming a target.
p164
aVAnd these fears are justified.
p165
aVAnd yet, there were 25 houses of worship that pledged to participate.
p166
aa(lp167
V(Applause)
p168
aa(lp169
VThese bold leaders took the gesture and reinforced it with their own meaning.
p170
aVFor some, it was to tell the world that they're not terrorists.
p171
aVFor others, it was to welcome people through their doors to ask questions.
p172
aVAnd for some, it was to bridge the gap
p173
aVbetween the older and the younger generation,
p174
aVwhich by the way is something that many faiths are grappling with right now.
p175
aVAnd for some it was simply to build neighborhood solidarity
p176
aVin advance of feared election violence.
p177
aVWhen asked why yellow,
p178
aVone imam beautifully said,
p179
aV"Yellow is the color of the sun.
p180
aVThe sun shines on us all equally.
p181
aVIt does not discriminate."
p182
aVHe and others spread the word through their congregations
p183
aVand over the radio.
p184
aVMunicipal government officials stepped forward and helped
p185
aVwith permits and with convening civil society organizations.
p186
aVA paint company donated a thousand liters of yellow paint
p187
aVmixed especially for us in what they now call "optimistic yellow."
p188
aa(lp189
V(Laughter)
p190
aa(lp191
V(Applause)
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd a poetry collective joined forces with a university
p194
aVand hosted a series of tweet chats
p195
aVthat challenged the nation on issues of faith,
p196
aVour faith not just in the context of religion,
p197
aVbut our faith in politicians and tribe and nation,
p198
aVour faith in the older generation and in the younger generation.
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd then Colour in Faith was launched at a gallery event
p201
aVthat invited an incredible mix of gallerygoers
p202
aVand religious leaders and artists and businesspeople.
p203
aVAlready, even before picking up a paintbrush,
p204
aVwe had accomplished so much of the conversation and connection
p205
aVthat we had hoped for.
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd then we began to paint.
p208
aVMuslims stood by Christians
p209
aVand atheists and agnostics and Hindus
p210
aVand painted a mosque yellow.
p211
aVAnd then they all came together again and painted a church yellow,
p212
aVand then another mosque,
p213
aVand then another church.
p214
aVPoets and musicians performed while we painted.
p215
aVWe painted in Nairobi,
p216
aVand then we painted in Mombasa.
p217
aVThe local and international press did features on Colour in Faith
p218
aVin English and French and Swahili
p219
aVand Spanish and Somali.
p220
aVCNN highlighted Colour in Faith as a way of bringing communities together.
p221
aVAnd our social media platforms lit up,
p222
aVconnecting more and more people.
p223
aVAnd these neighbors continued to stay in touch.
p224
aVThere are some that are pursuing politics with a platform of peace,
p225
aVand we have communities as far as Argentina and the US
p226
aVand as close as Mali and Rwanda
p227
aVthat are asking for our help.
p228
aVAnd we would love to help.
p229
aVIt's our dream that this project, this idea, spreads across the world,
p230
aVwith or without our support.
p231
aa(lp232
VColour in Faith is literally highlighting those who mean well in yellow.
p233
aVColour in Faith is binding neighborhoods together,
p234
aVand it's our hope that when threats come knocking,
p235
aVthey will collectively sift fact from rumor
p236
aVand stand in solidarity.
p237
aVWe've proven that the human family can come together and send a message
p238
aVfar brighter and more powerful
p239
aVthan the voices of those that wish to do us harm.
p240
aVThough fear is infectious,
p241
aVwe are showing that so is hope.
p242
aa(lp243
VThank you.
