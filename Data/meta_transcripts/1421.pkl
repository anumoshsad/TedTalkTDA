VI got my start
p4
aVin writing and research
p5
aVas a surgical trainee,
p6
aVas someone who was a long ways away
p7
aVfrom becoming any kind of an expert at anything.
p8
aVSo the natural question you ask then at that point
p9
aVis, how do I get good at what I'm trying to do?
p10
aVAnd it became a question of,
p11
aVhow do we all get good
p12
aVat what we're trying to do?
p13
aa(lp14
VIt's hard enough to learn to get the skills,
p15
aVtry to learn all the material you have to absorb
p16
aVat any task you're taking on.
p17
aVI had to think about how I sew and how I cut,
p18
aVbut then also how I pick the right person
p19
aVto come to an operating room.
p20
aVAnd then in the midst of all this
p21
aVcame this new context
p22
aVfor thinking about what it meant to be good.
p23
aa(lp24
VIn the last few years
p25
aVwe realized we were in the deepest crisis
p26
aVof medicine's existence
p27
aVdue to something you don't normally think about
p28
aVwhen you're a doctor
p29
aVconcerned with how you do good for people,
p30
aVwhich is the cost
p31
aVof health care.
p32
aVThere's not a country in the world
p33
aVthat now is not asking
p34
aVwhether we can afford what doctors do.
p35
aVThe political fight that we've developed
p36
aVhas become one around
p37
aVwhether it's the government that's the problem
p38
aVor is it insurance companies that are the problem.
p39
aVAnd the answer is yes and no;
p40
aVit's deeper than all of that.
p41
aa(lp42
VThe cause of our troubles
p43
aVis actually the complexity that science has given us.
p44
aVAnd in order to understand this,
p45
aVI'm going to take you back a couple of generations.
p46
aVI want to take you back
p47
aVto a time when Lewis Thomas was writing in his book, "The Youngest Science."
p48
aVLewis Thomas was a physician-writer,
p49
aVone of my favorite writers.
p50
aVAnd he wrote this book to explain, among other things,
p51
aVwhat it was like to be a medical intern
p52
aVat the Boston City Hospital
p53
aVin the pre-penicillin year
p54
aVof 1937.
p55
aVIt was a time when medicine was cheap
p56
aVand very ineffective.
p57
aVIf you were in a hospital, he said,
p58
aVit was going to do you good
p59
aVonly because it offered you
p60
aVsome warmth, some food, shelter,
p61
aVand maybe the caring attention
p62
aVof a nurse.
p63
aVDoctors and medicine
p64
aVmade no difference at all.
p65
aVThat didn't seem to prevent the doctors
p66
aVfrom being frantically busy in their days,
p67
aVas he explained.
p68
aa(lp69
VWhat they were trying to do
p70
aVwas figure out whether you might have one of the diagnoses
p71
aVfor which they could do something.
p72
aVAnd there were a few.
p73
aVYou might have a lobar pneumonia, for example,
p74
aVand they could give you an antiserum,
p75
aVan injection of rabid antibodies
p76
aVto the bacterium streptococcus,
p77
aVif the intern sub-typed it correctly.
p78
aVIf you had an acute congestive heart failure,
p79
aVthey could bleed a pint of blood from you
p80
aVby opening up an arm vein,
p81
aVgiving you a crude leaf preparation of digitalis
p82
aVand then giving you oxygen by tent.
p83
aVIf you had early signs of paralysis
p84
aVand you were really good at asking personal questions,
p85
aVyou might figure out
p86
aVthat this paralysis someone has is from syphilis,
p87
aVin which case you could give this nice concoction
p88
aVof mercury and arsenic \u2014
p89
aVas long as you didn't overdose them and kill them.
p90
aVBeyond these sorts of things,
p91
aVa medical doctor didn't have a lot that they could do.
p92
aa(lp93
VThis was when the core structure of medicine
p94
aVwas created \u2014
p95
aVwhat it meant to be good at what we did
p96
aVand how we wanted to build medicine to be.
p97
aVIt was at a time
p98
aVwhen what was known you could know,
p99
aVyou could hold it all in your head, and you could do it all.
p100
aVIf you had a prescription pad,
p101
aVif you had a nurse,
p102
aVif you had a hospital
p103
aVthat would give you a place to convalesce, maybe some basic tools,
p104
aVyou really could do it all.
p105
aVYou set the fracture, you drew the blood,
p106
aVyou spun the blood,
p107
aVlooked at it under the microscope,
p108
aVyou plated the culture, you injected the antiserum.
p109
aVThis was a life as a craftsman.
p110
aa(lp111
VAs a result, we built it around
p112
aVa culture and set of values
p113
aVthat said what you were good at
p114
aVwas being daring,
p115
aVat being courageous,
p116
aVat being independent and self-sufficient.
p117
aVAutonomy was our highest value.
p118
aVGo a couple generations forward
p119
aVto where we are, though,
p120
aVand it looks like a completely different world.
p121
aVWe have now found treatments
p122
aVfor nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions
p123
aVthat a human being can have.
p124
aVWe can't cure it all.
p125
aVWe can't guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life.
p126
aVBut we can make it possible
p127
aVfor most.
p128
aa(lp129
VBut what does it take?
p130
aVWell, we've now discovered
p131
aV4,000 medical and surgical procedures.
p132
aVWe've discovered 6,000 drugs
p133
aVthat I'm now licensed to prescribe.
p134
aVAnd we're trying to deploy this capability,
p135
aVtown by town,
p136
aVto every person alive \u2014
p137
aVin our own country,
p138
aVlet alone around the world.
p139
aVAnd we've reached the point where we've realized,
p140
aVas doctors,
p141
aVwe can't know it all.
p142
aVWe can't do it all
p143
aVby ourselves.
p144
aa(lp145
VThere was a study where they looked
p146
aVat how many clinicians it took to take care of you
p147
aVif you came into a hospital,
p148
aVas it changed over time.
p149
aVAnd in the year 1970,
p150
aVit took just over two full-time equivalents of clinicians.
p151
aVThat is to say,
p152
aVit took basically the nursing time
p153
aVand then just a little bit of time for a doctor
p154
aVwho more or less checked in on you
p155
aVonce a day.
p156
aVBy the end of the 20th century,
p157
aVit had become more than 15 clinicians
p158
aVfor the same typical hospital patient \u2014
p159
aVspecialists, physical therapists,
p160
aVthe nurses.
p161
aa(lp162
VWe're all specialists now,
p163
aVeven the primary care physicians.
p164
aVEveryone just has
p165
aVa piece of the care.
p166
aVBut holding onto that structure we built
p167
aVaround the daring, independence,
p168
aVself-sufficiency
p169
aVof each of those people
p170
aVhas become a disaster.
p171
aVWe have trained, hired and rewarded people
p172
aVto be cowboys.
p173
aVBut it's pit crews that we need,
p174
aVpit crews for patients.
p175
aa(lp176
VThere's evidence all around us:
p177
aV40 percent of our coronary artery disease patients
p178
aVin our communities
p179
aVreceive incomplete or inappropriate care.
p180
aV60 percent
p181
aVof our asthma, stroke patients
p182
aVreceive incomplete or inappropriate care.
p183
aVTwo million people come into hospitals
p184
aVand pick up an infection
p185
aVthey didn't have
p186
aVbecause someone failed to follow
p187
aVthe basic practices of hygiene.
p188
aVOur experience
p189
aVas people who get sick,
p190
aVneed help from other people,
p191
aVis that we have amazing clinicians
p192
aVthat we can turn to \u2014
p193
aVhardworking, incredibly well-trained and very smart \u2014
p194
aVthat we have access to incredible technologies
p195
aVthat give us great hope,
p196
aVbut little sense
p197
aVthat it consistently all comes together for you
p198
aVfrom start to finish
p199
aVin a successful way.
p200
aa(lp201
VThere's another sign
p202
aVthat we need pit crews,
p203
aVand that's the unmanageable cost
p204
aVof our care.
p205
aVNow we in medicine, I think,
p206
aVare baffled by this question of cost.
p207
aVWe want to say, "This is just the way it is.
p208
aVThis is just what medicine requires."
p209
aVWhen you go from a world
p210
aVwhere you treated arthritis with aspirin,
p211
aVthat mostly didn't do the job,
p212
aVto one where, if it gets bad enough,
p213
aVwe can do a hip replacement, a knee replacement
p214
aVthat gives you years, maybe decades,
p215
aVwithout disability,
p216
aVa dramatic change,
p217
aVwell is it any surprise
p218
aVthat that $40,000 hip replacement
p219
aVreplacing the 10-cent aspirin
p220
aVis more expensive?
p221
aVIt's just the way it is.
p222
aa(lp223
VBut I think we're ignoring certain facts
p224
aVthat tell us something about what we can do.
p225
aVAs we've looked at the data
p226
aVabout the results that have come
p227
aVas the complexity has increased,
p228
aVwe found
p229
aVthat the most expensive care
p230
aVis not necessarily the best care.
p231
aVAnd vice versa,
p232
aVthe best care
p233
aVoften turns out to be the least expensive \u2014
p234
aVhas fewer complications,
p235
aVthe people get more efficient at what they do.
p236
aVAnd what that means
p237
aVis there's hope.
p238
aVBecause [if] to have the best results,
p239
aVyou really needed the most expensive care
p240
aVin the country, or in the world,
p241
aVwell then we really would be talking about rationing
p242
aVwho we're going to cut off from Medicare.
p243
aVThat would be really our only choice.
p244
aa(lp245
VBut when we look at the positive deviants \u2014
p246
aVthe ones who are getting the best results
p247
aVat the lowest costs \u2014
p248
aVwe find the ones that look the most like systems
p249
aVare the most successful.
p250
aVThat is to say, they found ways
p251
aVto get all of the different pieces,
p252
aVall of the different components,
p253
aVto come together into a whole.
p254
aVHaving great components is not enough,
p255
aVand yet we've been obsessed in medicine with components.
p256
aVWe want the best drugs, the best technologies,
p257
aVthe best specialists,
p258
aVbut we don't think too much
p259
aVabout how it all comes together.
p260
aVIt's a terrible design strategy actually.
p261
aa(lp262
VThere's a famous thought experiment
p263
aVthat touches exactly on this
p264
aVthat said, what if you built a car
p265
aVfrom the very best car parts?
p266
aVWell it would lead you to put in Porsche brakes,
p267
aVa Ferrari engine,
p268
aVa Volvo body, a BMW chassis.
p269
aVAnd you put it all together and what do you get?
p270
aVA very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere.
p271
aVAnd that is what medicine can feel like sometimes.
p272
aVIt's not a system.
p273
aa(lp274
VNow a system, however,
p275
aVwhen things start to come together,
p276
aVyou realize it has certain skills
p277
aVfor acting and looking that way.
p278
aVSkill number one
p279
aVis the ability to recognize success
p280
aVand the ability to recognize failure.
p281
aVWhen you are a specialist,
p282
aVyou can't see the end result very well.
p283
aVYou have to become really interested in data,
p284
aVunsexy as that sounds.
p285
aa(lp286
VOne of my colleagues is a surgeon in Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
p287
aVand he got interested in the question of,
p288
aVwell how many CT scans did they do
p289
aVfor their community in Cedar Rapids?
p290
aVHe got interested in this
p291
aVbecause there had been government reports,
p292
aVnewspaper reports, journal articles
p293
aVsaying that there had been too many CT scans done.
p294
aVHe didn't see it in his own patients.
p295
aVAnd so he asked the question, "How many did we do?"
p296
aVand he wanted to get the data.
p297
aVIt took him three months.
p298
aVNo one had asked this question in his community before.
p299
aVAnd what he found was that,
p300
aVfor the 300,000 people in their community,
p301
aVin the previous year
p302
aVthey had done 52,000 CT scans.
p303
aVThey had found a problem.
p304
aa(lp305
VWhich brings us to skill number two a system has.
p306
aVSkill one, find where your failures are.
p307
aVSkill two is devise solutions.
p308
aVI got interested in this
p309
aVwhen the World Health Organization came to my team
p310
aVasking if we could help with a project
p311
aVto reduce deaths in surgery.
p312
aVThe volume of surgery had spread
p313
aVaround the world,
p314
aVbut the safety of surgery
p315
aVhad not.
p316
aVNow our usual tactics for tackling problems like these
p317
aVare to do more training,
p318
aVgive people more specialization
p319
aVor bring in more technology.
p320
aa(lp321
VWell in surgery, you couldn't have people who are more specialized
p322
aVand you couldn't have people who are better trained.
p323
aVAnd yet we see unconscionable levels
p324
aVof death, disability
p325
aVthat could be avoided.
p326
aVAnd so we looked at what other high-risk industries do.
p327
aVWe looked at skyscraper construction,
p328
aVwe looked at the aviation world,
p329
aVand we found
p330
aVthat they have technology, they have training,
p331
aVand then they have one other thing:
p332
aVThey have checklists.
p333
aVI did not expect
p334
aVto be spending a significant part
p335
aVof my time as a Harvard surgeon
p336
aVworrying about checklists.
p337
aVAnd yet, what we found
p338
aVwere that these were tools
p339
aVto help make experts better.
p340
aVWe got the lead safety engineer for Boeing to help us.
p341
aa(lp342
VCould we design a checklist for surgery?
p343
aVNot for the lowest people on the totem pole,
p344
aVbut for the folks
p345
aVwho were all the way around the chain,
p346
aVthe entire team including the surgeons.
p347
aVAnd what they taught us
p348
aVwas that designing a checklist
p349
aVto help people handle complexity
p350
aVactually involves more difficulty than I had understood.
p351
aVYou have to think about things
p352
aVlike pause points.
p353
aVYou need to identify the moments in a process
p354
aVwhen you can actually catch a problem before it's a danger
p355
aVand do something about it.
p356
aVYou have to identify
p357
aVthat this is a before-takeoff checklist.
p358
aVAnd then you need to focus on the killer items.
p359
aVAn aviation checklist,
p360
aVlike this one for a single-engine plane,
p361
aVisn't a recipe for how to fly a plane,
p362
aVit's a reminder of the key things
p363
aVthat get forgotten or missed
p364
aVif they're not checked.
p365
aa(lp366
VSo we did this.
p367
aVWe created a 19-item two-minute checklist
p368
aVfor surgical teams.
p369
aVWe had the pause points
p370
aVimmediately before anesthesia is given,
p371
aVimmediately before the knife hits the skin,
p372
aVimmediately before the patient leaves the room.
p373
aVAnd we had a mix of dumb stuff on there \u2014
p374
aVmaking sure an antibiotic is given in the right time frame
p375
aVbecause that cuts the infection rate by half \u2014
p376
aVand then interesting stuff,
p377
aVbecause you can't make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery.
p378
aVInstead, you can make a recipe
p379
aVfor how to have a team that's prepared for the unexpected.
p380
aVAnd we had items like making sure everyone in the room
p381
aVhad introduced themselves by name at the start of the day,
p382
aVbecause you get half a dozen people or more
p383
aVwho are sometimes coming together as a team
p384
aVfor the very first time that day that you're coming in.
p385
aa(lp386
VWe implemented this checklist
p387
aVin eight hospitals around the world,
p388
aVdeliberately in places from rural Tanzania
p389
aVto the University of Washington in Seattle.
p390
aVWe found that after they adopted it
p391
aVthe complication rates fell
p392
aV35 percent.
p393
aVIt fell in every hospital it went into.
p394
aVThe death rates fell
p395
aV47 percent.
p396
aVThis was bigger than a drug.
p397
aa(lp398
V(Applause)
p399
aa(lp400
VAnd that brings us
p401
aVto skill number three,
p402
aVthe ability to implement this,
p403
aVto get colleagues across the entire chain
p404
aVto actually do these things.
p405
aVAnd it's been slow to spread.
p406
aVThis is not yet our norm in surgery \u2014
p407
aVlet alone making checklists
p408
aVto go onto childbirth and other areas.
p409
aVThere's a deep resistance
p410
aVbecause using these tools
p411
aVforces us to confront
p412
aVthat we're not a system,
p413
aVforces us to behave with a different set of values.
p414
aVJust using a checklist
p415
aVrequires you to embrace different values from the ones we've had,
p416
aVlike humility,
p417
aVdiscipline,
p418
aVteamwork.
p419
aVThis is the opposite of what we were built on:
p420
aVindependence, self-sufficiency,
p421
aVautonomy.
p422
aa(lp423
VI met an actual cowboy, by the way.
p424
aVI asked him, what was it like
p425
aVto actually herd a thousand cattle
p426
aVacross hundreds of miles?
p427
aVHow did you do that?
p428
aVAnd he said, "We have the cowboys stationed at distinct places all around."
p429
aVThey communicate electronically constantly,
p430
aVand they have protocols and checklists
p431
aVfor how they handle everything \u2014
p432
aV(Laughter)
p433
aV\u2014 from bad weather
p434
aVto emergencies or inoculations for the cattle.
p435
aVEven the cowboys are pit crews now.
p436
aVAnd it seemed like time
p437
aVthat we become that way ourselves.
p438
aa(lp439
VMaking systems work
p440
aVis the great task of my generation
p441
aVof physicians and scientists.
p442
aVBut I would go further and say
p443
aVthat making systems work,
p444
aVwhether in health care, education,
p445
aVclimate change,
p446
aVmaking a pathway out of poverty,
p447
aVis the great task of our generation as a whole.
p448
aVIn every field, knowledge has exploded,
p449
aVbut it has brought complexity,
p450
aVit has brought specialization.
p451
aVAnd we've come to a place where we have no choice
p452
aVbut to recognize,
p453
aVas individualistic as we want to be,
p454
aVcomplexity requires
p455
aVgroup success.
p456
aVWe all need to be pit crews now.
