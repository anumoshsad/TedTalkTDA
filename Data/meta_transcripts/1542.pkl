VIn half a century of trying to help prevent wars,
p4
aVthere's one question that never leaves me:
p5
aVHow do we deal with extreme violence
p6
aVwithout using force in return?
p7
aVWhen you're faced with brutality,
p8
aVwhether it's a child facing a bully on a playground
p9
aVor domestic violence \u2014
p10
aVor, on the streets of Syria today,
p11
aVfacing tanks and shrapnel,
p12
aVwhat's the most effective thing to do?
p13
aVFight back? Give in?
p14
aVUse more force?
p15
aa(lp16
VThis question: "How do I deal with a bully
p17
aVwithout becoming a thug in return?"
p18
aVhas been with me ever since I was a child.
p19
aVI remember I was about 13,
p20
aVglued to a grainy black and white television in my parents' living room
p21
aVas Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest,
p22
aVand kids not much older than me
p23
aVwere throwing themselves at the tanks
p24
aVand getting mown down.
p25
aVAnd I rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd my mother came up and said, "What on Earth are you doing?"
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd I said, "I'm going to Budapest."
p30
aa(lp31
VAnd she said, "What on Earth for?"
p32
aa(lp33
VAnd I said, "Kids are getting killed there.
p34
aVThere's something terrible happening."
p35
aa(lp36
VAnd she said, "Don't be so silly."
p37
aVAnd I started to cry.
p38
aVAnd she got it, she said,
p39
aV"Okay, I see it's serious.
p40
aVYou're much too young to help.
p41
aVYou need training. I'll help you.
p42
aVBut just unpack your suitcase."
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd so I got some training
p45
aVand went and worked in Africa during most of my 20s.
p46
aVBut I realized that what I really needed to know
p47
aVI couldn't get from training courses.
p48
aVI wanted to understand
p49
aVhow violence, how oppression, works.
p50
aVAnd what I've discovered since is this:
p51
aVBullies use violence in three ways.
p52
aVThey use political violence to intimidate,
p53
aVphysical violence to terrorize
p54
aVand mental or emotional violence to undermine.
p55
aVAnd only very rarely in very few cases
p56
aVdoes it work to use more violence.
p57
aa(lp58
VNelson Mandela went to jail believing in violence,
p59
aVand 27 years later
p60
aVhe and his colleagues
p61
aVhad slowly and carefully
p62
aVhoned the skills, the incredible skills, that they needed
p63
aVto turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known
p64
aVinto a democracy.
p65
aVAnd they did it in a total devotion to non-violence.
p66
aVThey realized that using force against force
p67
aVdoesn't work.
p68
aa(lp69
VSo what does work?
p70
aVOver time I've collected about a half-dozen methods
p71
aVthat do work \u2014 of course there are many more \u2014
p72
aVthat do work and that are effective.
p73
aVAnd the first is
p74
aVthat the change that has to take place
p75
aVhas to take place here, inside me.
p76
aVIt's my response, my attitude, to oppression
p77
aVthat I've got control over,
p78
aVand that I can do something about.
p79
aa(lp80
VAnd what I need to develop is self-knowledge to do that.
p81
aVThat means I need to know how I tick,
p82
aVwhen I collapse,
p83
aVwhere my formidable points are,
p84
aVwhere my weaker points are.
p85
aVWhen do I give in?
p86
aVWhat will I stand up for?
p87
aVAnd meditation or self-inspection
p88
aVis one of the ways \u2014 again it's not the only one \u2014
p89
aVit's one of the ways
p90
aVof gaining this kind of inner power.
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd my heroine here \u2014 like Satish's \u2014
p93
aVis Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma.
p94
aVShe was leading a group of students
p95
aVon a protest in the streets of Rangoon.
p96
aVThey came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns.
p97
aVAnd she realized straight away
p98
aVthat the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers
p99
aVwere more scared than the student protesters behind her.
p100
aVBut she told the students to sit down.
p101
aVAnd she walked forward with such calm and such clarity
p102
aVand such total lack of fear
p103
aVthat she could walk right up to the first gun,
p104
aVput her hand on it and lower it.
p105
aVAnd no one got killed.
p106
aa(lp107
VSo that's what the mastery of fear can do \u2014
p108
aVnot only faced with machine guns,
p109
aVbut if you meet a knife fight in the street.
p110
aVBut we have to practice.
p111
aVSo what about our fear?
p112
aVI have a little mantra.
p113
aVMy fear grows fat
p114
aVon the energy I feed it.
p115
aVAnd if it grows very big
p116
aVit probably happens.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo we all know the three o'clock in the morning syndrome,
p119
aVwhen something you've been worrying about wakes you up \u2014
p120
aVI see a lot of people \u2014
p121
aVand for an hour you toss and turn,
p122
aVit gets worse and worse,
p123
aVand by four o'clock you're pinned to the pillow
p124
aVby a monster this big.
p125
aVThe only thing to do
p126
aVis to get up, make a cup of tea
p127
aVand sit down with the fear like a child beside you.
p128
aVYou're the adult.
p129
aVThe fear is the child.
p130
aVAnd you talk to the fear
p131
aVand you ask it what it wants, what it needs.
p132
aVHow can this be made better?
p133
aVHow can the child feel stronger?
p134
aVAnd you make a plan.
p135
aVAnd you say, "Okay, now we're going back to sleep.
p136
aVHalf-past seven, we're getting up and that's what we're going to do."
p137
aa(lp138
VI had one of these 3 a.m. episodes on Sunday \u2014
p139
aVparalyzed with fear at coming to talk to you.
p140
aV(Laughter)
p141
aVSo I did the thing.
p142
aVI got up, made the cup of tea, sat down with it, did it all
p143
aVand I'm here \u2014 still partly paralyzed, but I'm here.
p144
aa(lp145
V(Applause)
p146
aa(lp147
VSo that's fear. What about anger?
p148
aVWherever there is injustice there's anger.
p149
aVBut anger is like gasoline,
p150
aVand if you spray it around and somebody lights a match,
p151
aVyou've got an inferno.
p152
aVBut anger as an engine \u2014 in an engine \u2014 is powerful.
p153
aVIf we can put our anger inside an engine,
p154
aVit can drive us forward,
p155
aVit can get us through the dreadful moments
p156
aVand it can give us real inner power.
p157
aa(lp158
VAnd I learned this in my work
p159
aVwith nuclear weapon policy-makers.
p160
aVBecause at the beginning I was so outraged
p161
aVat the dangers they were exposing us to
p162
aVthat I just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong.
p163
aVTotally ineffective.
p164
aVIn order to develop a dialogue for change
p165
aVwe have to deal with our anger.
p166
aVIt's okay to be angry with the thing \u2014
p167
aVthe nuclear weapons in this case \u2014
p168
aVbut it is hopeless to be angry with the people.
p169
aVThey are human beings just like us.
p170
aVAnd they're doing what they think is best.
p171
aVAnd that's the basis on which we have to talk with them.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo that's the third one, anger.
p174
aVAnd it brings me to the crux
p175
aVof what's going on, or what I perceive as going on,
p176
aVin the world today,
p177
aVwhich is that last century was top-down power.
p178
aVIt was still governments telling people what to do.
p179
aVThis century there's a shift.
p180
aVIt's bottom-up or grassroots power.
p181
aVIt's like mushrooms coming through concrete.
p182
aVIt's people joining up with people, as Bundy just said, miles away
p183
aVto bring about change.
p184
aa(lp185
VAnd Peace Direct spotted quite early on
p186
aVthat local people in areas of very hot conflict
p187
aVknow what to do.
p188
aVThey know best what to do.
p189
aVSo Peace Direct gets behind them to do that.
p190
aVAnd the kind of thing they're doing
p191
aVis demobilizing militias,
p192
aVrebuilding economies,
p193
aVresettling refugees,
p194
aVeven liberating child soldiers.
p195
aVAnd they have to risk their lives almost every day
p196
aVto do this.
p197
aVAnd what they've realized
p198
aVis that using violence in the situations they operate in
p199
aVis not only less humane,
p200
aVbut it's less effective
p201
aVthan using methods that connect people with people, that rebuild.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd I think that the U.S. military
p204
aVis finally beginning to get this.
p205
aVUp to now their counter-terrorism policy
p206
aVhas been to kill insurgents at almost any cost,
p207
aVand if civilians get in the way,
p208
aVthat's written as "collateral damage."
p209
aVAnd this is so infuriating and humiliating
p210
aVfor the population of Afghanistan,
p211
aVthat it makes the recruitment for al-Qaeda very easy,
p212
aVwhen people are so disgusted by, for example,
p213
aVthe burning of the Koran.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo the training of the troops has to change.
p216
aVAnd I think there are signs that it is beginning to change.
p217
aVThe British military have always been much better at this.
p218
aVBut there is one magnificent example for them to take their cue from,
p219
aVand that's a brilliant U.S. lieutenant colonel
p220
aVcalled Chris Hughes.
p221
aVAnd he was leading his men down the streets of Najaf \u2014
p222
aVin Iraq actually \u2014
p223
aVand suddenly people were pouring out of the houses on either side of the road,
p224
aVscreaming, yelling, furiously angry,
p225
aVand surrounded these very young troops who were completely terrified,
p226
aVdidn't know what was going on, couldn't speak Arabic.
p227
aVAnd Chris Hughes strode into the middle of the throng
p228
aVwith his weapon above his head, pointing at the ground,
p229
aVand he said, "Kneel."
p230
aVAnd these huge soldiers
p231
aVwith their backpacks and their body armor,
p232
aVwobbled to the ground.
p233
aVAnd complete silence fell.
p234
aVAnd after about two minutes,
p235
aVeverybody moved aside and went home.
p236
aa(lp237
VNow that to me is wisdom in action.
p238
aVIn the moment, that's what he did.
p239
aVAnd it's happening everywhere now.
p240
aVYou don't believe me?
p241
aVHave you asked yourselves
p242
aVwhy and how so many dictatorships have collapsed
p243
aVover the last 30 years?
p244
aVDictatorships in Czechoslovakia, East Germany,
p245
aVEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
p246
aVMali, Madagascar,
p247
aVPoland, the Philippines,
p248
aVSerbia, Slovenia, I could go on,
p249
aVand now Tunisia and Egypt.
p250
aVAnd this hasn't just happened.
p251
aVA lot of it is due to a book
p252
aVwritten by an 80-year-old man in Boston, Gene Sharp.
p253
aVHe wrote a book called "From Dictatorship to Democracy"
p254
aVwith 81 methodologies for non-violent resistance.
p255
aVAnd it's been translated into 26 languages.
p256
aVIt's flown around the world.
p257
aVAnd it's being used by young people and older people everywhere,
p258
aVbecause it works and it's effective.
p259
aa(lp260
VSo this is what gives me hope \u2014
p261
aVnot just hope, this is what makes me feel very positive right now.
p262
aVBecause finally human beings are getting it.
p263
aVWe're getting practical, doable methodologies
p264
aVto answer my question:
p265
aVHow do we deal with a bully without becoming a thug?
p266
aVWe're using the kind of skills that I've outlined:
p267
aVinner power \u2014 the development of inner power \u2014 through self-knowledge,
p268
aVrecognizing and working with our fear,
p269
aVusing anger as a fuel,
p270
aVcooperating with others,
p271
aVbanding together with others,
p272
aVcourage,
p273
aVand most importantly, commitment to active non-violence.
p274
aa(lp275
VNow I don't just believe in non-violence.
p276
aVI don't have to believe in it.
p277
aVI see evidence everywhere of how it works.
p278
aVAnd I see that we, ordinary people,
p279
aVcan do what Aung San Suu Kyi and Ghandi and Mandela did.
p280
aVWe can bring to an end
p281
aVthe bloodiest century that humanity has ever known.
p282
aVAnd we can organize to overcome oppression
p283
aVby opening our hearts
p284
aVas well as strengthening this incredible resolve.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd this open-heartedness is exactly what I've experienced
p287
aVin the entire organization of this gathering since I got here yesterday.
p288
aVThank you.
