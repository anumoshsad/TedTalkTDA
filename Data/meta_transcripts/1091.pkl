VMark Zuckerberg,
p4
aVa journalist was asking him a question about the news feed.
p5
aVAnd the journalist was asking him,
p6
aV"Why is this so important?"
p7
aVAnd Zuckerberg said,
p8
aV"A squirrel dying in your front yard
p9
aVmay be more relevant to your interests right now
p10
aVthan people dying in Africa."
p11
aVAnd I want to talk about
p12
aVwhat a Web based on that idea of relevance might look like.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo when I was growing up
p15
aVin a really rural area in Maine,
p16
aVthe Internet meant something very different to me.
p17
aVIt meant a connection to the world.
p18
aVIt meant something that would connect us all together.
p19
aVAnd I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy
p20
aVand for our society.
p21
aVBut there's this shift
p22
aVin how information is flowing online,
p23
aVand it's invisible.
p24
aVAnd if we don't pay attention to it,
p25
aVit could be a real problem.
p26
aVSo I first noticed this in a place I spend a lot of time \u2014
p27
aVmy Facebook page.
p28
aVI'm progressive, politically \u2014 big surprise \u2014
p29
aVbut I've always gone out of my way to meet conservatives.
p30
aVI like hearing what they're thinking about;
p31
aVI like seeing what they link to;
p32
aVI like learning a thing or two.
p33
aVAnd so I was surprised when I noticed one day
p34
aVthat the conservatives had disappeared from my Facebook feed.
p35
aVAnd what it turned out was going on
p36
aVwas that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on,
p37
aVand it was noticing that, actually,
p38
aVI was clicking more on my liberal friends' links
p39
aVthan on my conservative friends' links.
p40
aVAnd without consulting me about it,
p41
aVit had edited them out.
p42
aVThey disappeared.
p43
aa(lp44
VSo Facebook isn't the only place
p45
aVthat's doing this kind of invisible, algorithmic
p46
aVediting of the Web.
p47
aVGoogle's doing it too.
p48
aVIf I search for something, and you search for something,
p49
aVeven right now at the very same time,
p50
aVwe may get very different search results.
p51
aVEven if you're logged out, one engineer told me,
p52
aVthere are 57 signals
p53
aVthat Google looks at \u2014
p54
aVeverything from what kind of computer you're on
p55
aVto what kind of browser you're using
p56
aVto where you're located \u2014
p57
aVthat it uses to personally tailor your query results.
p58
aVThink about it for a second:
p59
aVthere is no standard Google anymore.
p60
aVAnd you know, the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see.
p61
aVYou can't see how different your search results are
p62
aVfrom anyone else's.
p63
aa(lp64
VBut a couple of weeks ago,
p65
aVI asked a bunch of friends to Google "Egypt"
p66
aVand to send me screen shots of what they got.
p67
aVSo here's my friend Scott's screen shot.
p68
aVAnd here's my friend Daniel's screen shot.
p69
aVWhen you put them side-by-side,
p70
aVyou don't even have to read the links
p71
aVto see how different these two pages are.
p72
aVBut when you do read the links,
p73
aVit's really quite remarkable.
p74
aVDaniel didn't get anything about the protests in Egypt at all
p75
aVin his first page of Google results.
p76
aVScott's results were full of them.
p77
aVAnd this was the big story of the day at that time.
p78
aVThat's how different these results are becoming.
p79
aa(lp80
VSo it's not just Google and Facebook either.
p81
aVThis is something that's sweeping the Web.
p82
aVThere are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization.
p83
aVYahoo News, the biggest news site on the Internet,
p84
aVis now personalized \u2014 different people get different things.
p85
aVHuffington Post, the Washington Post, the New York Times \u2014
p86
aVall flirting with personalization in various ways.
p87
aVAnd this moves us very quickly
p88
aVtoward a world in which
p89
aVthe Internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see,
p90
aVbut not necessarily what we need to see.
p91
aVAs Eric Schmidt said,
p92
aV"It will be very hard for people to watch or consume something
p93
aVthat has not in some sense
p94
aVbeen tailored for them."
p95
aa(lp96
VSo I do think this is a problem.
p97
aVAnd I think, if you take all of these filters together,
p98
aVyou take all these algorithms,
p99
aVyou get what I call a filter bubble.
p100
aVAnd your filter bubble is your own personal,
p101
aVunique universe of information
p102
aVthat you live in online.
p103
aVAnd what's in your filter bubble
p104
aVdepends on who you are, and it depends on what you do.
p105
aVBut the thing is that you don't decide what gets in.
p106
aVAnd more importantly,
p107
aVyou don't actually see what gets edited out.
p108
aVSo one of the problems with the filter bubble
p109
aVwas discovered by some researchers at Netflix.
p110
aVAnd they were looking at the Netflix queues, and they noticed something kind of funny
p111
aVthat a lot of us probably have noticed,
p112
aVwhich is there are some movies
p113
aVthat just sort of zip right up and out to our houses.
p114
aVThey enter the queue, they just zip right out.
p115
aVSo "Iron Man" zips right out,
p116
aVand "Waiting for Superman"
p117
aVcan wait for a really long time.
p118
aa(lp119
VWhat they discovered
p120
aVwas that in our Netflix queues
p121
aVthere's this epic struggle going on
p122
aVbetween our future aspirational selves
p123
aVand our more impulsive present selves.
p124
aVYou know we all want to be someone
p125
aVwho has watched "Rashomon,"
p126
aVbut right now
p127
aVwe want to watch "Ace Ventura" for the fourth time.
p128
aV(Laughter)
p129
aVSo the best editing gives us a bit of both.
p130
aVIt gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber
p131
aVand a little bit of Afghanistan.
p132
aVIt gives us some information vegetables;
p133
aVit gives us some information dessert.
p134
aVAnd the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters,
p135
aVthese personalized filters,
p136
aVis that, because they're mainly looking
p137
aVat what you click on first,
p138
aVit can throw off that balance.
p139
aVAnd instead of a balanced information diet,
p140
aVyou can end up surrounded
p141
aVby information junk food.
p142
aa(lp143
VWhat this suggests
p144
aVis actually that we may have the story about the Internet wrong.
p145
aVIn a broadcast society \u2014
p146
aVthis is how the founding mythology goes \u2014
p147
aVin a broadcast society,
p148
aVthere were these gatekeepers, the editors,
p149
aVand they controlled the flows of information.
p150
aVAnd along came the Internet and it swept them out of the way,
p151
aVand it allowed all of us to connect together,
p152
aVand it was awesome.
p153
aVBut that's not actually what's happening right now.
p154
aVWhat we're seeing is more of a passing of the torch
p155
aVfrom human gatekeepers
p156
aVto algorithmic ones.
p157
aVAnd the thing is that the algorithms
p158
aVdon't yet have the kind of embedded ethics
p159
aVthat the editors did.
p160
aVSo if algorithms are going to curate the world for us,
p161
aVif they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see,
p162
aVthen we need to make sure
p163
aVthat they're not just keyed to relevance.
p164
aVWe need to make sure that they also show us things
p165
aVthat are uncomfortable or challenging or important \u2014
p166
aVthis is what TED does \u2014
p167
aVother points of view.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd the thing is, we've actually been here before
p170
aVas a society.
p171
aVIn 1915, it's not like newspapers were sweating a lot
p172
aVabout their civic responsibilities.
p173
aVThen people noticed
p174
aVthat they were doing something really important.
p175
aVThat, in fact, you couldn't have
p176
aVa functioning democracy
p177
aVif citizens didn't get a good flow of information,
p178
aVthat the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter,
p179
aVand then journalistic ethics developed.
p180
aVIt wasn't perfect,
p181
aVbut it got us through the last century.
p182
aVAnd so now,
p183
aVwe're kind of back in 1915 on the Web.
p184
aVAnd we need the new gatekeepers
p185
aVto encode that kind of responsibility
p186
aVinto the code that they're writing.
p187
aa(lp188
VI know that there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google \u2014
p189
aVLarry and Sergey \u2014
p190
aVpeople who have helped build the Web as it is,
p191
aVand I'm grateful for that.
p192
aVBut we really need you to make sure
p193
aVthat these algorithms have encoded in them
p194
aVa sense of the public life, a sense of civic responsibility.
p195
aVWe need you to make sure that they're transparent enough
p196
aVthat we can see what the rules are
p197
aVthat determine what gets through our filters.
p198
aVAnd we need you to give us some control
p199
aVso that we can decide
p200
aVwhat gets through and what doesn't.
p201
aVBecause I think
p202
aVwe really need the Internet to be that thing
p203
aVthat we all dreamed of it being.
p204
aVWe need it to connect us all together.
p205
aVWe need it to introduce us to new ideas
p206
aVand new people and different perspectives.
p207
aVAnd it's not going to do that
p208
aVif it leaves us all isolated in a Web of one.
