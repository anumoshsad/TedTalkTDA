VShe wrote:
p4
aV"When I become famous, I will tell everyone
p5
aVthat I know a hero named Marlon Peterson."
p6
aa(lp7
VHeroes rarely look like me.
p8
aVIn fact,
p9
aVI'm what garbage looks like.
p10
aVNo, not the most appealing way to open a talk
p11
aVor start a conversation,
p12
aVand perhaps you have some questions going through your head about that.
p13
aVWhy would this man say such a thing about himself?
p14
aVWhat does he mean?
p15
aVHow can someone view him as a hero when he sees himself as garbage?
p16
aa(lp17
VI believe we learn more from questions than we do from answers.
p18
aVBecause when we're questioning something,
p19
aVwe're invested in taking in some sort of new information,
p20
aVor grappling with some sort of ignorance that makes us feel uncomfortable.
p21
aVAnd that's why I'm here:
p22
aVto push us to question,
p23
aVeven when it makes us uncomfortable.
p24
aa(lp25
VMy parents are from Trinidad and Tobago,
p26
aVthe southernmost island in the Caribbean.
p27
aVTrinidad is also home to the only acoustic instrument
p28
aVinvented in the 20th century:
p29
aVthe steel pan.
p30
aVDeriving from the African drums
p31
aVand evolving from the genius of one of the ghettos in Trinidad,
p32
aVa city called Laventille,
p33
aVand the disregard of the American military ...
p34
aVWell, I should tell you,
p35
aVAmerica, during WWII, had military bases set up in Trinidad,
p36
aVand when the war ended,
p37
aVthey left the island littered with empty oil drums \u2014
p38
aVtheir trash.
p39
aVSo people from Laventille repurposed the old drums left behind
p40
aVinto the full chromatic scale:
p41
aVthe steel pan.
p42
aVPlaying music now from Beethoven to Bob Marley to 50 Cent,
p43
aVthose people literally made music out of garbage.
p44
aa(lp45
VTwelve days before my 20th birthday,
p46
aVI was arrested for my role in a violent robbery attempt
p47
aVin lower Manhattan.
p48
aVWhile people were sitting in a coffee shop,
p49
aVfour people were shot.
p50
aVTwo were killed.
p51
aVFive of us were arrested.
p52
aVWe were all the products of Trinidad and Tobago.
p53
aVWe were the "bad immigrants,"
p54
aVor the "anchor babies" that Trump and millions of Americans easily malign.
p55
aVI was discarded, like waste material \u2014
p56
aVand justifiably so to many.
p57
aVI eventually served 10 years, two months and seven days of a prison sentence.
p58
aVI was sentenced to a decade of punishment in a correctional institution.
p59
aVI was sentenced to irrelevance \u2014
p60
aVthe opposite of humanity.
p61
aa(lp62
VInterestingly,
p63
aVit was during those years in prison that a series of letters redeemed me,
p64
aVhelped me move beyond the darkness and the guilt
p65
aVassociated with the worst moment of my young life.
p66
aVIt gave me a sense that I was useful.
p67
aVShe was 13 years old.
p68
aVShe had wrote that she saw me as a hero.
p69
aVI remember reading that,
p70
aVand I remember crying when I read those words.
p71
aa(lp72
VShe was one of over 50 students
p73
aVand 150 letters that I wrote during a mentoring correspondence program
p74
aVthat I co-designed with a friend
p75
aVwho was a teacher at a middle school in Brooklyn,
p76
aVmy hometown.
p77
aVWe called it the Young Scholars Program.
p78
aVEvery time those young people shared their stories with me,
p79
aVtheir struggles,
p80
aVevery time they drew a picture of their favorite cartoon character
p81
aVand sent it to me,
p82
aVevery time they said they depended on my letters or my words of advice,
p83
aVit boosted my sense of worthiness.
p84
aVIt gave me a sense of what I could contribute to this planet.
p85
aVIt transformed my life.
p86
aa(lp87
VBecause of those letters and what they shared with me,
p88
aVtheir stories of teen life,
p89
aVthey gave me the permission,
p90
aVthey gave me the courage to admit to myself
p91
aVthat there were reasons \u2014 not excuses \u2014
p92
aVbut that there were reasons for that fateful day in October of 1999;
p93
aVthat the trauma associated with living in a community
p94
aVwhere guns are easier to get than sneakers;
p95
aVthat the trauma associated with being raped at gunpoint at the age of 14;
p96
aVthat those are reasons for me
p97
aVwhy making that decision,
p98
aVthat fatal decision,
p99
aVwas not an unlikely proposition.
p100
aa(lp101
VBecause those letters mattered so much to me,
p102
aVbecause writing and receiving
p103
aVand having that communication with those folks
p104
aVso hugely impacted my life,
p105
aVI decided to share the opportunity with some friends of mine
p106
aVwho were also inside with me.
p107
aVMy friends Bill and Cory and Arocks,
p108
aVall in prison for violent crimes also,
p109
aVshared their words of wisdom with the young people as well,
p110
aVand received the sense of relevancy in return.
p111
aVWe are now published writers and youth program innovators
p112
aVand trauma experts
p113
aVand gun violence prevention advocates,
p114
aVand TED talkers and \u2014
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
Vand good daddies.
p119
aVThat's what I call a positive return of investment.
p120
aa(lp121
VAbove all else,
p122
aVwhat building that program taught me was that when we sow,
p123
aVwhen we invest in the humanity of people no matter where they're at,
p124
aVwe can reap amazing rewards.
p125
aa(lp126
VIn this latest era of criminal justice reform,
p127
aVI often question and wonder why \u2014
p128
aVwhy is it that so many believe
p129
aVthat only those who have been convicted of nonviolent drug offenses
p130
aVmerit empathy and recognized humanity?
p131
aVCriminal justice reform is human justice.
p132
aVAm I not human?
p133
aVWhen we invest in resources that amplify the relevancy of people
p134
aVin communities like Laventille
p135
aVor parts of Brooklyn or a ghetto near you,
p136
aVwe can literally create the communities that we want.
p137
aa(lp138
VWe can do better.
p139
aVWe can do better than investing solely in law enforcement as a resource,
p140
aVbecause they don't give us a sense of relevancy
p141
aVthat is at the core of why so many of us do so many harmful things
p142
aVin the pursuit of mattering.
p143
aVSee, gun violence is just a visible display of a lot of underlying traumas.
p144
aVWhen we invest in the redemptive value of relevancy,
p145
aVwe can render a return of both personal responsibility and healing.
p146
aVThat's the people work I care about,
p147
aVbecause people work.
p148
aa(lp149
VFamily, I'm asking you to do the hard work,
p150
aVthe difficult work,
p151
aVthe churning work of bestowing undeserved kindness
p152
aVupon those who we can relegate as garbage,
p153
aVwho we can disregard and discard easily.
p154
aVI'm asking myself.
p155
aa(lp156
VOver the past two months,
p157
aVI've lost two friends to gun violence,
p158
aVboth innocent bystanders.
p159
aVOne was caught in a drive-by while walking home.
p160
aVThe other was sitting in a café while eating breakfast,
p161
aVwhile on vacation in Miami.
p162
aVI'm asking myself to see the redemptive value of relevancy
p163
aVin the people that murdered them,
p164
aVbecause of the hard work of seeing the value in me.
p165
aVI'm pushing us to challenge our own capacity
p166
aVto fully experience our humanity,
p167
aVby understanding the full biography
p168
aVof people who we can easily choose not to see,
p169
aVbecause heroes are waiting to be recognized,
p170
aVand music is waiting to be made.
p171
aa(lp172
VThank you.
