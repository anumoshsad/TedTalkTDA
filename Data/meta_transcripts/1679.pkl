VWell, I was introduced as
p4
aVthe former Governor of Michigan,
p5
aVbut actually I'm a scientist.
p6
aVAll right, a political scientist, it doesn't really count,
p7
aVbut my laboratory was the laboratory of democracy
p8
aVthat is Michigan, and, like any good scientist,
p9
aVI was experimenting with policy
p10
aVabout what would achieve the greatest good
p11
aVfor the greatest number.
p12
aVBut there were three problems, three enigmas
p13
aVthat I could not solve,
p14
aVand I want to share with you those problems,
p15
aVbut most importantly,
p16
aVI think I figured out a proposal for a solution.
p17
aa(lp18
VThe first problem
p19
aVthat not just Michigan, but every state, faces is,
p20
aVhow do you create good jobs in America
p21
aVin a global economy?
p22
aa(lp23
VSo let me share with you some empirical data from my lab.
p24
aVI was elected in 2002 and, at the end of my first year in office in 2003,
p25
aVI got a call from one of my staff members, who said,
p26
aV"Gov, we have a big problem.
p27
aVWe have a little tiny community called Greenville, Michigan,
p28
aVpopulation 8,000,
p29
aVand they are about to lose their major employer,
p30
aVwhich is a refrigerator factory that's operated by Electrolux."
p31
aa(lp32
VAnd I said, "Well, how many people work at Electrolux?"
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd he said, "3,000 of the 8,000 people in Greenville."
p35
aa(lp36
VSo it is a one-company town.
p37
aVAnd Electrolux was going to go to Mexico.
p38
aa(lp39
VSo I said, "Forget that. I'm the new Governor.
p40
aVWe can fix this. We're going to go to Greenville
p41
aVwith my whole cabinet and we will just
p42
aVmake Electrolux an offer they can't refuse."
p43
aa(lp44
VSo I brought my whole cabinet,
p45
aVand we met with all of the pooh-bahs of little Greenville \u2014
p46
aVthe mayor, the city manager, the head of the community college \u2014
p47
aVand we basically emptied our pockets
p48
aVand put all of our chips on the table,
p49
aVincentives, you name it, to convince Electrolux to stay,
p50
aVand as we made our pile of chips,
p51
aVwe slid them across the table to the management of Electrolux.
p52
aVAnd in the pile were things like zero taxes for 20 years,
p53
aVor that we'd help to build a new factory for the company,
p54
aVwe'd help to finance it. The UAW, who represented the workers,
p55
aVsaid they would offer unprecedented concessions,
p56
aVsacrifices to just keep those jobs in Greenville.
p57
aa(lp58
VSo the management of Electrolux took our pile,
p59
aVour list of incentives, and they went outside the room
p60
aVfor 17 minutes,
p61
aVand they came back in and they said,
p62
aV"Wow, this is the most generous
p63
aVany community has ever been to try to keep jobs here.
p64
aVBut there's nothing you can do
p65
aVto compensate for the fact that we can pay $1.57 an hour
p66
aVin Juarez, Mexico. So we're leaving."
p67
aa(lp68
VAnd they did. And when they did, it was like
p69
aVa nuclear bomb went off in little Greenville.
p70
aVIn fact, they did implode the factory.
p71
aVThat's a guy that is walking on his last day of work.
p72
aVAnd on the month that the last refrigerator rolled off the assembly line,
p73
aVthe employees of Electrolux in Greenville, Michigan,
p74
aVhad a gathering for themselves that they called the last supper.
p75
aVIt was in a big pavilion in Greenville, an indoor pavilion,
p76
aVand I went to it because I was so frustrated as Governor
p77
aVthat I couldn't stop the outflow of these jobs,
p78
aVand I wanted to grieve with them,
p79
aVand as I went into the room\u2014 there's thousands of people there.
p80
aVIt was a just big thing. People were eating boxed lunches
p81
aVon roundtop tables, and there was a sad band playing music,
p82
aVor a band playing sad music, probably both. (Laughter)
p83
aa(lp84
VAnd this guy comes up to me,
p85
aVand he's got tattoos and his ponytail and his baseball cap on,
p86
aVand he had his two daughters with him,
p87
aVand he said, "Gov, these are my two daughters."
p88
aVHe said, "I'm 48 years old,
p89
aVand I have worked at this factory for 30 years.
p90
aVI went from high school to factory.
p91
aVMy father worked at this factory," he said.
p92
aV"My grandfather worked at this factory.
p93
aVAll I know is how to make refrigerators."
p94
aVAnd he looked at his daughters,
p95
aVand he puts his hand on his chest,
p96
aVand he says, "So, Gov, tell me,
p97
aVwho is ever going to hire me?
p98
aVWho is ever going to hire me?"
p99
aVAnd that was asked not just by that guy
p100
aVbut by everyone in the pavilion,
p101
aVand frankly, by every worker at one of the 50,000 factories
p102
aVthat closed in the first decade of this century.
p103
aVEnigma number one: How do you create jobs
p104
aVin America in a global economy?
p105
aa(lp106
VNumber two, very quickly:
p107
aVHow do you solve global climate change
p108
aVwhen we don't even have a national energy policy in this country
p109
aVand when gridlock in Congress seems to be the norm?
p110
aVIn fact, there was a poll that was done recently
p111
aVand the pollster compared Congress's approval ratings
p112
aVto a number of other unpleasant things,
p113
aVand it was found, in fact, that Congress's approval rating
p114
aVis worse than cockroaches,
p115
aVlice, Nickelback the band, root canals and Donald Trump. (Laughter)
p116
aVBut wait, the good news is it's at least better
p117
aVthan meth labs and gonorrhea. (Laughter)
p118
aVWe got a problem, folks.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo it got me thinking, what is it?
p121
aVWhat in the laboratory that I see out there,
p122
aVthe laboratories of democracy, what has happened?
p123
aVWhat policy prescriptions have happened
p124
aVthat actually cause changes to occur
p125
aVand that have been accepted in a bipartisan way?
p126
aVSo if I asked you, for example,
p127
aVwhat was the Obama Administration policy
p128
aVthat caused massive changes across the country,
p129
aVwhat would you say?
p130
aVYou might say Obamacare, except for those were not voluntary changes.
p131
aVAs we know, only half the states have opted in.
p132
aVWe might say the Recovery Act, but those didn't require policy changes.
p133
aVThe thing that caused massive policy changes to occur
p134
aVwas Race to the Top for education.
p135
aVWhy? The government put a $4.5 billion pot
p136
aVand said to the governors across the country, compete for it.
p137
aVForty-eight governors competed,
p138
aVconvincing 48 state legislatures to essentially
p139
aVraise standards for high schoolers
p140
aVso that they all take a college prep curriculum.
p141
aVForty-eight states opted in, creating a national [education] policy from the bottom up.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo I thought, well, why can't we do something like that
p144
aVand create a clean energy jobs race to the top?
p145
aVBecause after all, if you look at the context,
p146
aV1.6 trillion dollars has been invested in the past eight years
p147
aVfrom the private sector globally,
p148
aVand every dollar represents a job,
p149
aVand where are those jobs going?
p150
aVWell, they're going to places that have policy, like China.
p151
aVIn fact, I was in China to see what they were doing,
p152
aVand they were putting on a dog-and-pony show for the group that I was with,
p153
aVand I was standing in the back of the room during one of the demonstrations
p154
aVand standing next to one of the Chinese officials,
p155
aVand we were watching, and he says,
p156
aV"So, Gov, when do you think the U.S. is going to get national energy policy?"
p157
aVAnd I said, "Oh my God \u2014 Congress, gridlock, who knows?"
p158
aa(lp159
VAnd this is what he did, he goes, he says,
p160
aV"Take your time."
p161
aVBecause they see our passivity as their opportunity.
p162
aa(lp163
VSo what if we decided to create
p164
aVa challenge to the governors of the country,
p165
aVand the price to entry into this competition
p166
aVused the same amount that the bipartisan group approved in Congress
p167
aVfor the Race to the Top for education, 4.5 billion,
p168
aVwhich sounds like a lot, but actually it's less than
p169
aVone tenth of one percent of federal spending.
p170
aVIt's a rounding error on the federal side.
p171
aVBut price to entry into that competition would be,
p172
aVyou could just, say, use the President's goal.
p173
aVHe wants Congress to adopt a clean energy standard
p174
aVof 80 percent by 2030,
p175
aVin other words, that you'd have to get 80 percent
p176
aVof your energy from clean sources by the year 2030.
p177
aVWhy not ask all of the states to do that instead?
p178
aVAnd imagine what might happen,
p179
aVbecause every region has something to offer.
p180
aVYou might take states like Iowa and Ohio \u2014
p181
aVtwo very important political states, by the way \u2014
p182
aVthose two governors, and they would say,
p183
aVwe're going to lead the nation in producing
p184
aVthe wind turbines and the wind energy.
p185
aVYou might say the solar states, the sun belt,
p186
aVwe're going to be the states that produce solar energy for the country,
p187
aVand maybe Jerry Brown says, "Well, I'm going to create
p188
aVan industry cluster in California
p189
aVto be able to produce the solar panels
p190
aVso that we're not buying them from China
p191
aVbut we're buying them from the U.S."
p192
aVIn fact, every region of the country could do this.
p193
aVYou see, you've got solar and wind opportunity all across the nation.
p194
aVIn fact, if you look just at the upper and northern states
p195
aVin the West, they could do geothermal,
p196
aVor you could look at Texas and say,
p197
aVwe could lead the nation in the solutions to smart grid.
p198
aVIn the middle eastern states which have access to forests
p199
aVand to agricultural waste, they might say,
p200
aVwe're going to lead the nation in biofuels.
p201
aVIn the upper northeast, we're going to lead the nation
p202
aVin energy efficiency solutions.
p203
aVAlong the eastern seaboard, we're going to lead the nation
p204
aVin offshore wind.
p205
aVYou might look at Michigan and say, we're going to lead the nation
p206
aVin producing the guts for the electric vehicle, like the lithium ion battery.
p207
aVEvery region has something to offer,
p208
aVand if you created a competition,
p209
aVit respects the states and it respects federalism.
p210
aVIt's opt-in. You might even get Texas and South Carolina,
p211
aVwho didn't opt into the education Race to the Top,
p212
aVyou might even get them to opt in. Why?
p213
aVBecause Republican and Democratic governors
p214
aVlove to cut ribbons.
p215
aVWe want to bring jobs. I'm just saying.
p216
aVAnd it fosters innovation at the state level
p217
aVin these laboratories of democracy.
p218
aa(lp219
VNow, any of you who are watching anything about politics lately
p220
aVmight say, "Okay, great idea, but really?
p221
aVCongress putting four and a half billion dollars on the table?
p222
aVThey can't agree to anything."
p223
aVSo you could wait and go through Congress,
p224
aValthough you should be very impatient.
p225
aVOr, you renegades, we could go around Congress.
p226
aVGo around Congress.
p227
aVWhat if we created a private sector challenge to the governors?
p228
aVWhat if several of the high-net worth companies
p229
aVand individuals who are here at TED decided
p230
aVthat they would create, band together, just a couple of them,
p231
aVand create a national competition to the governors
p232
aVto have a race to the top
p233
aVand see how the governors respond?
p234
aVWhat if it all started here at TED?
p235
aVWhat if you were here
p236
aVwhen we figured out how to crack the code
p237
aVto create good paying jobs in America \u2014 (Applause) \u2014
p238
aVand get national energy policy
p239
aVand we created a national energy strategy from the bottom up?
p240
aa(lp241
VBecause, dear TEDsters,
p242
aVif you are impatient like I am,
p243
aVyou know that our economic competitors,
p244
aVour other nations, are in the game
p245
aVand are eating us for lunch.
p246
aVAnd we can get in the game or not.
p247
aVWe can be at the table or we can be on the table.
p248
aVAnd I don't know about you,
p249
aVbut I prefer to dine.
p250
aa(lp251
VThank you all so much. (Applause)
