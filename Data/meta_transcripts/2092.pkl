VWhen, in 1960, still a student,
p4
aVI got a traveling fellowship
p5
aVto study housing in North America.
p6
aVWe traveled the country.
p7
aVWe saw public housing high-rise buildings
p8
aVin all major cities:
p9
aVNew York, Philadelphia.
p10
aVThose who have no choice lived there.
p11
aVAnd then we traveled from suburb to suburb,
p12
aVand I came back thinking,
p13
aVwe've got to reinvent the apartment building.
p14
aVThere has to be another way of doing this.
p15
aVWe can't sustain suburbs,
p16
aVso let's design a building
p17
aVwhich gives the qualities of a house
p18
aVto each unit.
p19
aa(lp20
VHabitat would be all about gardens,
p21
aVcontact with nature,
p22
aVstreets instead of corridors.
p23
aVWe prefabricated it so we would achieve economy,
p24
aVand there it is almost 50 years later.
p25
aVIt's a very desirable place to live in.
p26
aVIt's now a heritage building,
p27
aVbut it did not proliferate.
p28
aa(lp29
VIn 1973, I made my first trip to China.
p30
aVIt was the Cultural Revolution.
p31
aVWe traveled the country,
p32
aVmet with architects and planners.
p33
aVThis is Beijing then,
p34
aVnot a single high rise building
p35
aVin Beijing or Shanghai.
p36
aVShenzhen didn't even exist as a city.
p37
aVThere were hardly any cars.
p38
aVThirty years later,
p39
aVthis is Beijing today.
p40
aVThis is Hong Kong.
p41
aVIf you're wealthy, you live there,
p42
aVif you're poor, you live there,
p43
aVbut high density it is, and it's not just Asia.
p44
aVSão Paulo, you can travel
p45
aVin a helicopter 45 minutes
p46
aVseeing those high-rise buildings consume
p47
aVthe 19th-century low-rise environment.
p48
aVAnd with it, comes congestion,
p49
aVand we lose mobility, and so on and so forth.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo a few years ago, we decided to go back
p52
aVand rethink Habitat.
p53
aVCould we make it more affordable?
p54
aVCould we actually achieve this quality of life
p55
aVin the densities that are prevailing today?
p56
aVAnd we realized, it's basically about light,
p57
aVit's about sun, it's about nature,
p58
aVit's about fractalization.
p59
aVCan we open up the surface of the building
p60
aVso that it has more contact with the exterior?
p61
aa(lp62
VWe came up with a number of models:
p63
aVeconomy models, cheaper to build and more compact;
p64
aVmembranes of housing
p65
aVwhere people could design their own house
p66
aVand create their own gardens.
p67
aVAnd then we decided to take New York as a test case,
p68
aVand we looked at Lower Manhattan.
p69
aVAnd we mapped all the building area in Manhattan.
p70
aVOn the left is Manhattan today:
p71
aVblue for housing, red for office buildings, retail.
p72
aVOn the right, we reconfigured it:
p73
aVthe office buildings form the base,
p74
aVand then rising 75 stories above,
p75
aVare apartments.
p76
aVThere's a street in the air on the 25th level,
p77
aVa community street.
p78
aVIt's permeable.
p79
aVThere are gardens and open spaces
p80
aVfor the community,
p81
aValmost every unit with its own private garden,
p82
aVand community space all around.
p83
aVAnd most important, permeable, open.
p84
aVIt does not form a wall or an obstruction in the city,
p85
aVand light permeates everywhere.
p86
aa(lp87
VAnd in the last two or three years,
p88
aVwe've actually been, for the first time,
p89
aVrealizing the quality of life of Habitat
p90
aVin real-life projects across Asia.
p91
aVThis in Qinhuangdao in China:
p92
aVmiddle-income housing, where there is a bylaw
p93
aVthat every apartment must receive
p94
aVthree hours of sunlight.
p95
aVThat's measured in the winter solstice.
p96
aVAnd under construction in Singapore,
p97
aVagain middle-income housing, gardens,
p98
aVcommunity streets and parks and so on and so forth.
p99
aVAnd Colombo.
p100
aa(lp101
VAnd I want to touch on one more issue,
p102
aVwhich is the design of the public realm.
p103
aVA hundred years after we've begun building
p104
aVwith tall buildings,
p105
aVwe are yet to understand
p106
aVhow the tall high-rise building
p107
aVbecomes a building block in making a city,
p108
aVin creating the public realm.
p109
aVIn Singapore, we had an opportunity:
p110
aV10 million square feet, extremely high density.
p111
aVTaking the concept of outdoor and indoor,
p112
aVpromenades and parks integrated
p113
aVwith intense urban life.
p114
aVSo they are outdoor spaces and indoor spaces,
p115
aVand you move from one to the other,
p116
aVand there is contact with nature,
p117
aVand most relevantly, at every level of the structure,
p118
aVpublic gardens and open space:
p119
aVon the roof of the podium,
p120
aVclimbing up the towers,
p121
aVand finally on the roof, the sky park,
p122
aVtwo and a half acres, jogging paths, restaurants,
p123
aVand the world's longest swimming pool.
p124
aVAnd that's all I can tell you in five minutes.
p125
aa(lp126
VThank you.
