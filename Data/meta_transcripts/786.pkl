VI'm Jon M. Chu. And I'm not a dancer,
p8
aVI'm not a choreographer \u2014 I'm actually a filmmaker, a storyteller.
p9
aVI directed a movie two years ago
p10
aVcalled "Step Up 2: The Streets."
p11
aVAnybody? Anybody? Yeah!
p12
aVDuring that movie I got to meet a ton of hip-hop dancers \u2014
p13
aVamazing, the best in the world \u2014
p14
aVand they brought me into a society, the sort of underground
p15
aVstreet culture that blew my mind.
p16
aVI mean, this is literally human beings
p17
aVwith super-human strength and abilities.
p18
aVThey could fly in the air. They could bend their elbow all the way back.
p19
aVThey could spin on their heads for 80 times in a row.
p20
aVI'd never seen anything like that.
p21
aa(lp22
VWhen I was growing up, my heroes were people like
p23
aVFred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Michael Jackson.
p24
aVI grew up in a musical family.
p25
aV(Laughter)
p26
aVAnd those guys, those were like, ultimate heroes.
p27
aVBeing a shy, little, skinny Asian kid growing up in the Silicon Valley
p28
aVwith low self-esteem, those guys made me believe in something bigger.
p29
aVThose guys made me want to, like, "I'm going to do that
p30
aVmoonwalk at that bar mitzvah tonight for that girl."
p31
aa(lp32
V(Applause)
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd it seems like those dance heroes have disappeared,
p35
aVsort of relegated to the background of pop stars and music videos.
p36
aVBut after seeing what I've seen,
p37
aVthe truth is, they have not disappeared at all.
p38
aVThey're here, getting better and better every day.
p39
aVAnd dance has progressed.
p40
aVIt is insane what dance is right now.
p41
aVDance has never had a better friend than technology.
p42
aa(lp43
VOnline videos and social networking ...
p44
aVdancers have created a whole global laboratory online
p45
aVfor dance, where kids in Japan are taking moves
p46
aVfrom a YouTube video created in Detroit,
p47
aVbuilding on it within days and releasing a new video,
p48
aVwhile teenagers in California are taking the Japanese video and remixing it
p49
aVwith a Philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself.
p50
aVAnd this is happening every day.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages,
p53
aVwith cheap webcams,
p54
aVlies the world's great dancers of tomorrow.
p55
aVOur Fred Astaires, our Gene Kellys
p56
aVour Michael Jacksons are right at our fingertips,
p57
aVand may not have that opportunity, except for us.
p58
aa(lp59
VSo, we created the LXD,
p60
aVsort of a \u2014 the Legion of Extraordinary Dancers,
p61
aVa justice league of dancers that believe
p62
aVthat dance can have a transformative effect on the world.
p63
aVA living, breathing comic book series,
p64
aVbut unlike Spiderman and Iron Man,
p65
aVthese guys can actually do it.
p66
aVAnd we're going to show you some today. So, let me introduce to you,
p67
aVsome of our heroes right now.
p68
aVWe got Madd Chadd,
p69
aVLil' C, Kid David and J Smooth.
p70
aVPlease be excited, have fun, yell, scream.
p71
aVLadies and gentlemen: The LXD.

aa(lp75
V(Video): Madd Chadd: When people first see me,
p76
aVI get a lot of different reactions actually.
p77
aVSometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it,
p78
aVbut sometimes they get a little freaked out.
p79
aVAnd, I don't know, I kind of get a kick out of that a little bit.

VJ Smooth: When I'm in the zone \u2014 I'm dancing and free styling it \u2014
p86
aVI actually visually kind of picture
p87
aVlines, and moving them.
p88
aVI think of like, Transformers,
p89
aVlike how panels open and then they fold,
p90
aVthey fold in, and then you close that panel.
p91
aVAnd then another thing opens,
p92
aVyou close that.

VKid David: It's kind of like, honestly a lot of times
p99
aVI don't really know what's going on
p100
aVwhen I'm dancing.
p101
aVBecause at that point it's just really like, it's my body and the music.
p102
aVIt's not really a conscious decision,
p103
aV"I'm going to do this next, I'm going to do this."
p104
aVIt's kind of like this other level
p105
aVwhere you can't make choices anymore,
p106
aVand it's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music.
p107
aVI got my name just because I was so young.
p108
aVI was young when I started. I was younger than a lot of the people I was dancing with.
p109
aVSo, it was always like, they called me Kid David, because I was the kid.

VL'il C: I tell them to create a ball,
p116
aVand then you just use that ball of energy.
p117
aVAnd instead of throwing it out, people would think
p118
aVthat's a krump move, that's a krump move.
p119
aVThat's not a krump move. You're going to throw it out,
p120
aVyou throw it out, and you hold it.
p121
aVAnd you let it go, and then right when you see the tail,
p122
aVyou grab it by the tail, then you bring it back in.
p123
aVAnd you just got this piece of energy
p124
aVand you just, you're manipulating it.
p125
aVYou know, you create power, then you tame it.
