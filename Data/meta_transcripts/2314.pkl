VFor more than 100 years,
p4
aVthe telephone companies have provided wiretapping assistance to governments.
p5
aa(lp6
VFor much of this time, this assistance was manual.
p7
aVSurveillance took place manually and wires were connected by hand.
p8
aVCalls were recorded to tape.
p9
aVBut as in so many other industries,
p10
aVcomputing has changed everything.
p11
aVThe telephone companies built surveillance features
p12
aVinto the very core of their networks.
p13
aVI want that to sink in for a second:
p14
aVOur telephones and the networks that carry our calls
p15
aVwere wired for surveillance first.
p16
aVFirst and foremost.
p17
aa(lp18
VSo what that means is that when you're talking to your spouse,
p19
aVyour children, a colleague or your doctor on the telephone,
p20
aVsomeone could be listening.
p21
aVNow, that someone might be your own government;
p22
aVit could also be another government, a foreign intelligence service,
p23
aVor a hacker, or a criminal, or a stalker
p24
aVor any other party that breaks into the surveillance system,
p25
aVthat hacks into the surveillance system of the telephone companies.
p26
aa(lp27
VBut while the telephone companies have built surveillance as a priority,
p28
aVSilicon Valley companies have not.
p29
aVAnd increasingly, over the last couple years,
p30
aVSilicon Valley companies have built strong encryption technology
p31
aVinto their communications products
p32
aVthat makes surveillance extremely difficult.
p33
aa(lp34
VFor example, many of you might have an iPhone,
p35
aVand if you use an iPhone to send a text message
p36
aVto other people who have an iPhone,
p37
aVthose text messages cannot easily be wiretapped.
p38
aVAnd in fact, according to Apple,
p39
aVthey're not able to even see the text messages themselves.
p40
aVLikewise, if you use FaceTime to make an audio call
p41
aVor a video call with one of your friends or loved ones,
p42
aVthat, too, cannot be easily wiretapped.
p43
aa(lp44
VAnd it's not just Apple.
p45
aVWhatsApp, which is now owned by Facebook
p46
aVand used by hundreds of millions of people around the world,
p47
aValso has built strong encryption technology into its product,
p48
aVwhich means that people in the Global South can easily communicate
p49
aVwithout their governments, often authoritarian,
p50
aVwiretapping their text messages.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo, after 100 years of being able to listen to any telephone call \u2014
p53
aVanytime, anywhere \u2014
p54
aVyou might imagine that government officials are not very happy.
p55
aVAnd in fact, that's what's happening.
p56
aVGovernment officials are extremely mad.
p57
aVAnd they're not mad because these encryption tools are now available.
p58
aVWhat upsets them the most
p59
aVis that the tech companies have built encryption features into their products
p60
aVand turned them on by default.
p61
aVIt's the default piece that matters.
p62
aa(lp63
VIn short, the tech companies have democratized encryption.
p64
aVAnd so, government officials like British Prime Minister David Cameron,
p65
aVthey believe that all communications \u2014 emails, texts, voice calls \u2014
p66
aVall of these should be available to governments,
p67
aVand encryption is making that difficult.
p68
aa(lp69
VNow, look \u2014 I'm extremely sympathetic to their point of view.
p70
aVWe live in a dangerous time in a dangerous world,
p71
aVand there really are bad people out there.
p72
aVThere are terrorists and other serious national security threats
p73
aVthat I suspect we all want the FBI and the NSA to monitor.
p74
aa(lp75
VBut those surveillance features come at a cost.
p76
aVThe reason for that is
p77
aVthat there is no such thing as a terrorist laptop,
p78
aVor a drug dealer's cell phone.
p79
aVWe all use the same communications devices.
p80
aVWhat that means is that if the drug dealers' telephone calls
p81
aVor the terrorists' telephone calls can be intercepted,
p82
aVthen so can the rest of ours, too.
p83
aVAnd I think we really need to ask:
p84
aVShould a billion people around the world be using devices
p85
aVthat are wiretap friendly?
p86
aa(lp87
VSo the scenario of hacking of surveillance systems that I've described \u2014
p88
aVthis is not imaginary.
p89
aVIn 2009,
p90
aVthe surveillance systems that Google and Microsoft built into their networks \u2014
p91
aVthe systems that they use to respond to lawful surveillance requests
p92
aVfrom the police \u2014
p93
aVthose systems were compromised by the Chinese government,
p94
aVbecause the Chinese government wanted to figure out
p95
aVwhich of their own agents the US government was monitoring.
p96
aa(lp97
VBy the same token,
p98
aVin 2004, the surveillance system built into the network
p99
aVof Vodafone Greece \u2014 Greece's largest telephone company \u2014
p100
aVwas compromised by an unknown entity,
p101
aVand that feature, the surveillance feature,
p102
aVwas used to wiretap the Greek Prime Minister
p103
aVand members of the Greek cabinet.
p104
aVThe foreign government or hackers who did that were never caught.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd really, this gets to the very problem with these surveillance features,
p107
aVor backdoors.
p108
aVWhen you build a backdoor into a communications network
p109
aVor piece of technology,
p110
aVyou have no way of controlling who's going to go through it.
p111
aVYou have no way of controlling
p112
aVwhether it'll be used by your side or the other side,
p113
aVby good guys, or by bad guys.
p114
aa(lp115
VAnd so for that reason, I think that it's better
p116
aVto build networks to be as secure as possible.
p117
aVYes, this means that in the future,
p118
aVencryption is going to make wiretapping more difficult.
p119
aVIt means that the police are going to have a tougher time
p120
aVcatching bad guys.
p121
aVBut the alternative would mean to live in a world
p122
aVwhere anyone's calls or anyone's text messages could be surveilled
p123
aVby criminals, by stalkers and by foreign intelligence agencies.
p124
aVAnd I don't want to live in that kind of world.
p125
aa(lp126
VAnd so right now, you probably have the tools
p127
aVto thwart many kinds of government surveillance
p128
aValready on your phones and already in your pockets,
p129
aVyou just might not realize how strong and how secure those tools are,
p130
aVor how weak the other ways you've used to communicate really are.
p131
aa(lp132
VAnd so, my message to you is this:
p133
aVWe need to use these tools.
p134
aVWe need to secure our telephone calls.
p135
aVWe need to secure our text messages.
p136
aVI want you to use these tools.
p137
aVI want you to tell your loved ones, I want you to tell your colleagues:
p138
aVUse these encrypted communications tools.
p139
aVDon't just use them because they're cheap and easy,
p140
aVbut use them because they're secure.
p141
aa(lp142
VThank you.
