VWhen I was a kid,
p4
aVI experienced something so powerful,
p5
aVI spent the rest of my life searching for it,
p6
aVand in all the wrong places.
p7
aVWhat I experienced wasn't virtual reality.
p8
aVIt was music.
p9
aVAnd this is where the story begins.
p10
aa(lp11
VThat's me,
p12
aVlistening to the Beatles' "White Album."
p13
aVAnd the look on my face is the feeling
p14
aVthat I've been searching for ever since.
p15
aVMusic goes straight to the emotional vein,
p16
aVinto your bloodstream
p17
aVand right into your heart.
p18
aVIt deepens every experience.
p19
aVFellas?
p20
aa(lp21
V(Music)
p22
aa(lp23
VThis is the amazing McKenzie Stubbert
p24
aVand Joshua Roman.
p25
aVMusic \u2014
p26
aa(lp27
V(Applause)
p28
aa(lp29
VYeah.
p30
aa(lp31
VMusic makes everything have more emotional resonance.
p32
aVLet's see how it does for this talk.
p33
aVThe right piece of music at the right time fuses with us
p34
aVon a cellular level.
p35
aVWhen I hear that one song
p36
aVfrom that one summer
p37
aVwith that one girl,
p38
aVI'm instantly transported back there again.
p39
aVHey, Stacey.
p40
aa(lp41
VHere's a part of the story, though, where I got a little greedy.
p42
aVI thought if I added more layers on top of the music,
p43
aVI could make the feelings even more powerful.
p44
aVSo I got into directing music videos.
p45
aVThis is what they looked like.
p46
aVThat's my brother, Jeff.
p47
aVSorry about this, Jeff.
p48
aa(lp49
V(Laughter)
p50
aa(lp51
VHere's me, just so we're even.
p52
aVIncredible moves.
p53
aVShould've been a dancer.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VThese experiments grew,
p58
aVand in time, started to look more like this.
p59
aVIn both, I'm searching for the same thing, though,
p60
aVto capture that lightning in a bottle.
p61
aVExcept, I'm not.
p62
aVAdding moving pictures over the music added narrative dimension, yes,
p63
aVbut never quite equated the power
p64
aVthat just raw music had for me on its own.
p65
aVThis is not a great thing to realize when you've devoted your life
p66
aVand professional career to becoming a music video director.
p67
aVI kept asking myself, did I take the wrong path?
p68
aVSo I started thinking: if I could involve you, the audience, more,
p69
aVI might be able to make you feel something more as well.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo Aaron Koblin and I began auditioning new technologies
p72
aVthat could put more of you inside of the work,
p73
aVlike your childhood home in "The Wilderness Downtown,"
p74
aVyour hand-drawn portraits, in "The Johnny Cash Project,"
p75
aVand your interactive dreams
p76
aVin "3 Dreams of Black."
p77
aVWe were pushing beyond the screen,
p78
aVtrying to connect more deeply
p79
aVto people's hearts and imaginations.
p80
aVBut it wasn't quite enough.
p81
aVIt still didn't have the raw experiential power of pure music for me.
p82
aa(lp83
VSo I started chasing a new technology
p84
aVthat I only had read about in science fiction.
p85
aVAnd after years of searching, I found a prototype.
p86
aVIt was a project from Nonny de la Peña in Mark Bolas's lab in USC.
p87
aVAnd when I tried it, I knew I'd found it.
p88
aVI could taste the lightning.
p89
aVIt was called virtual reality.
p90
aVThis was it five years ago when I ran into it.
p91
aVThis is what it looks like now.
p92
aa(lp93
VI quickly started building things in this new medium,
p94
aVand through that process we realized something:
p95
aVthat VR is going to play an incredibly important role
p96
aVin the history of mediums.
p97
aVIn fact, it's going to be the last one.
p98
aVI mean this because it's the first medium that actually makes the jump
p99
aVfrom our internalization of an author's expression
p100
aVof an experience,
p101
aVto our experiencing it firsthand.
p102
aVYou look confused. I'll explain. Don't worry.
p103
aa(lp104
V(Laughter)
p105
aa(lp106
VIf we go back to the origins of mediums,
p107
aVby all best guesses,
p108
aVit starts around a fire, with a good story.
p109
aVOur clan leader is telling us
p110
aVabout how he hunted the woolly mammoth on the tundra that day.
p111
aVWe hear his words
p112
aVand translate them into our own internal truths.
p113
aVThe same thing happens
p114
aVwhen we look at the cave painting version of the story,
p115
aVthe book about the mammoth hunt,
p116
aVthe play,
p117
aVthe radio broadcast,
p118
aVthe television show
p119
aVor the movie.
p120
aVAll of these mediums require what we call "suspension of disbelief,"
p121
aVbecause there's a translation gap between the reality of the story
p122
aVand our consciousness interpreting the story
p123
aVinto our reality.
p124
aVI'm using the word "consciousness" as a feeling of reality that we get
p125
aVfrom our senses experiencing the world around us.
p126
aa(lp127
VVirtual reality bridges that gap.
p128
aVNow, you are on the tundra hunting with the clan leader.
p129
aVOr you are the clan leader.
p130
aVOr maybe you're even the woolly mammoth.
p131
aa(lp132
V(Laughter)
p133
aa(lp134
VSo here's what special about VR.
p135
aVIn all other mediums,
p136
aVyour consciousness interprets the medium.
p137
aVIn VR, your consciousness is the medium.
p138
aVSo the potential for VR is enormous.
p139
aVBut where are we now?
p140
aVWhat is the current state of the art?
p141
aVWell,
p142
aVwe are here.
p143
aVWe are the equivalent of year one of cinema.
p144
aVThis is the Lumière Brothers film
p145
aVthat allegedly sent a theater full of people running for their lives
p146
aVas they thought a train was coming toward them.
p147
aVSimilar to this early stage of this medium,
p148
aVin VR, we also have to move past the spectacle
p149
aVand into the storytelling.
p150
aVIt took this medium decades
p151
aVto figure out its preferred language of storytelling,
p152
aVin the form of a feature film.
p153
aVIn VR today, we're more learning grammar
p154
aVthan writing language.
p155
aa(lp156
VWe've made 15 films in the last year at our VR company, Vrse,
p157
aVand we've learned a few things.
p158
aVWe found that we have a unique, direct path into your senses,
p159
aVyour emotions, even your body.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo let me show you some things.
p162
aVFor the purpose of this demo,
p163
aVwe're going to take every direction that you could possibly look,
p164
aVand stretch it into this giant rectangle.
p165
aVOK, here we go.
p166
aa(lp167
VSo, first: camera movement is tricky in VR.
p168
aVDone wrong, it can actually make you sick.
p169
aVWe found if you move the camera at a constant speed in a straight line,
p170
aVyou can actually get away with it, though.
p171
aVThe first day in film school,
p172
aVthey told me you have to learn every single rule
p173
aVbefore you can break one.
p174
aVWe have not learned every single rule.
p175
aVWe've barely learned any at all,
p176
aVbut we're already trying to break them
p177
aVto see what kind of creative things we can accomplish.
p178
aVIn this shot here, where we're moving up off the ground, I added acceleration.
p179
aVI did that because I wanted to give you a physical sensation
p180
aVof moving up off the ground.
p181
aVIn VR, I can give that to you.
p182
aa(lp183
V(Music)
p184
aa(lp185
VNot surprisingly, music matters a lot in this medium as well.
p186
aVIt guides us how to feel.
p187
aVIn this project we made with the New York Times, Zach Richter
p188
aVand our friend, JR,
p189
aVwe take you up in a helicopter,
p190
aVand even though you're flying 2,000 feet above Manhattan,
p191
aVyou don't feel afraid.
p192
aVYou feel triumphant for JR's character.
p193
aVThe music guides you there.
p194
aa(lp195
V(Music)
p196
aa(lp197
VContrary to popular belief,
p198
aVthere is composition in virtual reality,
p199
aVbut it's completely different than in film,
p200
aVwhere you have a rectangular frame.
p201
aVComposition is now where your consciousness exists
p202
aVand how the world moves around you.
p203
aVIn this film, "Waves of Grace," which was a collaboration between Vrse,
p204
aVthe United Nations, Gabo Arora, and Imraan Ismail,
p205
aVwe also see the changing role of the close-up in virtual reality.
p206
aVA close-up in VR means you're actually close up to someone.
p207
aVIt brings that character inside of your personal space,
p208
aVa space that we'd usually reserve for the people that we love.
p209
aVAnd you feel an emotional closeness to the character
p210
aVbecause of what you feel to be a physical closeness.
p211
aa(lp212
VDirecting VR is not like directing for the rectangle.
p213
aVIt's more of a choreography of the viewer's attention.
p214
aVOne tool we can use to guide your attention
p215
aVis called "spatialized sound."
p216
aVI can put a sound anywhere in front of you, to left or right,
p217
aVeven behind you,
p218
aVand when you turn your head, the sound will rotate accordingly.
p219
aVSo I can use that to direct your attention to where I want you to see.
p220
aVNext time you hear someone singing over your shoulder,
p221
aVit might be Bono.
p222
aa(lp223
V(Laughter)
p224
aa(lp225
VVR makes us feel like we are part of something.
p226
aVFor most of human history, we lived in small family units.
p227
aVWe started in caves,
p228
aVthen moved to clans and tribes, then villages and towns,
p229
aVand now we're all global citizens.
p230
aVBut I believe that we are still hardwired to care the most
p231
aVabout the things that are local to us.
p232
aVAnd VR makes anywhere and anyone feel local.
p233
aVThat's why it works as an empathy machine.
p234
aVOur film "Clouds Over Sidra" takes you to a Syrian refugee camp,
p235
aVand instead of watching a story about people over there,
p236
aVit's now a story about us here.
p237
aa(lp238
VBut where do we go from here?
p239
aVThe tricky thing is that with all previous mediums,
p240
aVthe format is fixed at its birth.
p241
aVFilm has been a sequence of rectangles,
p242
aVfrom Muybridge and his horses to now.
p243
aVThe format has never changed.
p244
aVBut VR as a format, as a medium,
p245
aVisn't complete yet.
p246
aVIt's not using physical celluloid or paper or TV signals.
p247
aVIt actually employs what we use to make sense of the world.
p248
aVWe're using your senses as the paints on the canvas,
p249
aVbut only two right now.
p250
aVEventually, we can see if we will have all of our human senses employed,
p251
aVand we will have agency to live the story in any path we choose.
p252
aVAnd we call it virtual reality right now,
p253
aVbut what happens when we move past simulated realities?
p254
aVWhat do we call it then?
p255
aVWhat if instead of verbally telling you about a dream,
p256
aVI could let you live inside that dream?
p257
aVWhat if instead of just experiencing visiting some reality on Earth,
p258
aVyou could surf gravitational waves on the edge of a black hole,
p259
aVor create galaxies from scratch,
p260
aVor communicate with each other not using words
p261
aVbut using our raw thoughts?
p262
aVThat's not a virtual reality anymore.
p263
aVAnd honestly I don't know what that's called.
p264
aVBut I hope you see where we're going.
p265
aa(lp266
VBut here I am, intellectualizing a medium I'm saying is experiential.
p267
aVSo let's experience it.
p268
aVIn your hands, you hopefully hold a piece of cardboard.
p269
aVLet's open the flap.
p270
aVTap on the power button to unlock the phone.
p271
aVFor the people watching at home,
p272
aVwe're going to put up a card right now
p273
aVto show you how to download this experience on your phone yourself,
p274
aVand even get a Google cardboard of your own to try it with.
p275
aVWe played in cardboard boxes as kids,
p276
aVand as adults, I'm hoping we can all find a little bit of that lightning
p277
aVby sticking our head in one again.
p278
aVYou're about to participate
p279
aVin the largest collective VR viewing in history.
p280
aVAnd in that classic old-timey style of yesteryear,
p281
aVwe're all going to watch something
p282
aVat the exact same time, together.
p283
aVLet's hope it works.
p284
aVWhat's the countdown look like? I can't see.
p285

V(Video) JR: Let me tell you
p296
aVhow I shot the cover of the New York Times Magazine,
p297
aV"Walking New York."
p298
aVI just got strapped on outside the helicopter,
p299
aVand I had to be perfectly vertical so I could grab it.
p300
aVAnd when I was perfectly above \u2014
p301
aVyou know, with the wind, we had to redo it a few times \u2014
p302
aVthen I kept shooting.
p303
aa(lp304
V(Video) Woman's voice: Dear Lord,
p305
aVprotect us from evil,
p306
aVfor you are the Lord,
p307

p308
aVYou who gave us life took it away.
p309
aVLet your will be done.
p310
aVPlease bring peace to the many who have lost loved ones.
p311
aVHelp us to live again.

aVSometimes I think
p319
aVwe are the ones in charge.
p320
aa(lp321
VChris Milk: How was it?
p322
aa(lp323
V(Applause)
p324
aa(lp325
VThat was a cheap way of getting you to do a standing ovation.
p326
aVI just made you all stand. I knew you'd applaud at the end.
p327
aa(lp328
V(Applause)
p329
aa(lp330
VI believe that everyone on Earth needs to experience
p331
aVwhat you just experienced.
p332
aVThat way we can collectively start to shape this,
p333
aVnot as a tech platform
p334
aVbut as a humanity platform.
p335
aVAnd to that end, in November of last year,
p336
aVthe New York Times and Vrse made a VR project called "The Displaced."
p337
aVIt launched with one million Google Cardboards
p338
aVsent out to every Sunday subscriber with their newspaper.
p339
aVBut a funny thing happened that Sunday morning.
p340
aVA lot of people got them
p341
aVthat were not the intended recipients on the mailing label.
p342
aVAnd we started seeing this all over Instagram.
p343
aVLook familiar?
p344
aa(lp345
VMusic led me on a path
p346
aVof searching for what seemed like the unattainable
p347
aVfor a very long time.
p348
aVNow, millions of kids just had the same formative experience
p349
aVin their childhood
p350
aVthat I had in mine.
p351
aVOnly I think this one
p352
aVsurpasses it.
p353
aVLet's see
p354
aVwhere this
p355
aVleads them.
