VSilicon Valley is obsessed with disruption,
p4
aVbut these days, the biggest disruptor didn't come out of Silicon Valley.
p5
aVIt came out of steel towns in Ohio,
p6
aVrural communities in Pennsylvania,
p7
aVthe Panhandle in Florida.
p8
aVAnd this last US presidential election
p9
aVwas the mother of all disruptions.
p10
aVOnce again, politics is personal.
p11
aVMillions of Americans became activists overnight,
p12
aVpouring into the streets in record numbers
p13
aVin record time.
p14
aa(lp15
V(Laughter)
p16
aa(lp17
VThe election has done to family holiday dinners
p18
aVwhat Uber has done to New York City's taxi system.
p19
aVCouples have broken up and marriages disrupted.
p20
aVAnd the election is doing to my private life
p21
aVwhat Amazon is doing to shopping malls.
p22
aVThese days, the ACLU is on the front lines 24/7,
p23
aVand even if I manage to sneak away for a couple of miles on the treadmill,
p24
aVany cardio benefit I get is instantly obliterated
p25
aVwhen I read another presidential tweet on the headline scroll.
p26
aVEven my secret pleasure
p27
aVof studying the Italian painters
p28
aVhave been infected by politics.
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, I study, even stalk, the old masters.
p31
aVThis is my desk,
p32
aVwith a postcard exhibition
p33
aVof some famous and obscure paintings
p34
aVmostly from the Italian Renaissance.
p35
aVNow, art used to provide me with a necessary break
p36
aVfrom the hurly-burly of politics
p37
aVin my daily work at the ACLU,
p38
aVbut not anymore.
p39
aa(lp40
VI was at the Women's March in San Francisco
p41
aVthe day after inauguration,
p42
aVand the crowd was chanting, "This is what democracy looks like."
p43
aV"This is what democracy looks like."
p44
aVAnd there I was holding my sign and my umbrella in the rain,
p45
aVand I flashed on an old painting
p46
aVthat first captivated me many years ago.
p47
aVI struggled to remember the different pieces
p48
aVof an actual painting
p49
aVof good and bad government.
p50
aVIt was almost like the old master was taunting me.
p51
aVYou want to know what democracy looks like?
p52
aVGo back and look at my frescoes.
p53
aa(lp54
VAnd so I did.
p55
aVIn 1339, Ambrogio Lorenzetti finished a monumental commission
p56
aVin the governing council chamber of Siena's Palazzo Pubblico.
p57
aVIt's a painting that speaks to us, even screams to us, today.
p58
aV"Art is a lie that makes us realize truth,"
p59
aVPablo Picasso once said.
p60
aVAnd as we search for the truth about government,
p61
aVwe should keep Ambrogio's work,
p62
aVnot a lie but an allegory, in our collective mind's eye.
p63
aa(lp64
VDuring Lorenzetti's time,
p65
aVthe political legitimacy of Italian city-states
p66
aVwas often on very shaky ground.
p67
aVSiena was a republic,
p68
aVbut there had been enormous unrest
p69
aVin the two decades leading up to the commission.
p70
aVSiena's political leaders, who would literally govern
p71
aVunder the eyes of these allegorical figures,
p72
aVwere Lorenzetti's intended audience.
p73
aVHe was cataloging the obligations
p74
aVof the governing to the governed.
p75
aa(lp76
VNow, you can spend years studying these frescoes.
p77
aVSome scholars have.
p78
aVI'm hardly an art historian,
p79
aVbut I am passionate about art,
p80
aVand a work this massive can overwhelm me.
p81
aVSo first, I focus on the big stuff.
p82
aa(lp83
VThis is the allegory of good government.
p84
aVThe majestic figure here in the middle
p85
aVis dressed in Siena's colors
p86
aVand he personifies the republic itself.
p87
aVLorenzetti labels him "Commune,"
p88
aVand he's basically telling the Sienese
p89
aVthat they, and not a king or a tyrant, must rule themselves.
p90
aVNow, surrounding Commune are his advisors.
p91
aVJustice is enthroned.
p92
aVShe's looking up at the figure of wisdom,
p93
aVwho actually supports her scales of justice.
p94
aVConcord, or Harmony,
p95
aVholds a string that comes off the scales of justice
p96
aVthat binds her to the citizens,
p97
aVmaking them all compatriots in the republic.
p98
aVAnd finally we see Peace.
p99
aVShe looks chilled out,
p100
aVlike she's listening to Bob Marley.
p101
aVWhen good government rules,
p102
aVPeace doesn't break a sweat.
p103
aa(lp104
VNow, these are big images and big ideas,
p105
aVbut I really love the small stuff.
p106
aVAlong another wall,
p107
aVLorenzetti illustrates the effects of good government
p108
aVon the real and everyday lives of ordinary people
p109
aVwith a series of delicious little details.
p110
aVIn the countryside, the hills are landscaped and farmed.
p111
aVCrops are being sown, hoed, reaped, milled, plowed,
p112
aVall in one picture.
p113
aVCrops and livestock are being brought to market.
p114
aVIn the city, builders raise a tower.
p115
aVPeople attend a law lecture, a TED Talk of the 14th century.
p116
aa(lp117
V(Laughter)
p118
aa(lp119
VSchoolchildren play.
p120
aVTradesmen thrive.
p121
aVDancers larger than life dance with joy.
p122
aVAnd watching over the republic is the winged figure Security,
p123
aVwhose banner reads,
p124
aV"Everyone shall go forth freely without fear."
p125
aa(lp126
VNow, what's amazing about these images from 800 years ago
p127
aVis that they're familiar to us today.
p128
aVWe see what democracy looks like.
p129
aVWe experience the effects of good government in our lives,
p130
aVjust as Lorenzetti did in his life.
p131
aa(lp132
VBut it is the allegory of bad government
p133
aVthat has been haunting me since November 9.
p134
aVIt's badly damaged,
p135
aVbut it reads like today's newspapers.
p136
aVAnd ruling over bad government is not the Commune
p137
aVbut the Tyrant.
p138
aVHe has horns, tusks, crossed eyes,
p139
aVbraided hair.
p140
aVHe obviously spends a lot of time on that hair.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VJustice now lies helpless at his feet,
p145
aVshackled.
p146
aVHer scales have been severed.
p147
aVJustice is the key antagonist to the Tyrant,
p148
aVand she's been taken out.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow, surrounding the Tyrant,
p151
aVLorenzetti illustrates the vices that animate bad government.
p152
aVAvarice is the old woman clutching the strongbox
p153
aVand a fisherman's hook
p154
aVto pull in her fortune.
p155
aVVainglory carries a mirror,
p156
aVand Lorenzetti warns us against narcissistic leaders
p157
aVwho are guided by their own ego and vanity.
p158
aVOn the Tyrant's right is Cruelty.
p159
aVTreason, half lamb, half scorpion,
p160
aVlulls us into a false sense of security
p161
aVand then poisons a republic.
p162
aVFraud, with the flighty wings of a bat.
p163
aVOn the Tyrant's left, you see Division.
p164
aVShe's dressed in Siena's colors.
p165
aV"Si" and "No" are painted on her body.
p166
aVShe uses a carpenter's saw to chop her body in half.
p167
aVAnd Fury wields the weapons of the mob,
p168
aVthe stone and knife.
p169
aa(lp170
VIn the remainder of the fresco, Lorenzetti shows us
p171
aVthe inevitable effects of bad government.
p172
aVThe civic ideals celebrated elsewhere in this room have failed us,
p173
aVand we see it.
p174
aVThe once beautiful city has fallen to pieces,
p175
aVthe countryside barren,
p176
aVthe farms abandoned.
p177
aVMany are in flames.
p178
aVAnd in the sky above is not the winged figure Security,
p179
aVbut that of Fear, whose banner reads:
p180
aV"None shall pass along this road
p181
aVwithout fear of death."
p182
aa(lp183
VNow, the final image, the most important one, really,
p184
aVis one that Lorenzetti did not paint.
p185
aVIt is of the viewer.
p186
aVToday, the audience for Lorenzetti's frescoes
p187
aVis not the governing but the governed,
p188
aVthe individual who stands in front of his allegories
p189
aVand walks away with insight,
p190
aVwho heeds a call to action.
p191
aVLorenzetti warns us that we must recognize the shadows
p192
aVof Avarice, Fraud, Division, even Tyranny
p193
aVwhen they float across our political landscape,
p194
aVespecially when those shadows are cast
p195
aVby political leaders loudly claiming to be the voice of good government
p196
aVand promising to make America great again.
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd we must act.
p199
aVDemocracy must not be a spectator sport.
p200
aVThe right to protest, the right to assemble freely,
p201
aVthe right to petition one's government,
p202
aVthese are not just rights.
p203
aVIn the face of Avarice, Fraud and Division,
p204
aVthese are obligations.
p205
aVWe have to disrupt \u2014
p206
aa(lp207
V(Applause)
p208
aa(lp209
VWe have to disrupt our lives
p210
aVso that we can disrupt
p211
aVthe amoral accretion of power
p212
aVby those who would betray our values.
p213
aVWe and we the people
p214
aVmust raise justice up
p215
aVand must bring peace to our nation
p216
aVand must come together in concord,
p217
aVand we have a choice.
p218
aVWe could either paint ourselves
p219
aVinto the worst nightmare of Lorenzetti's bad government,
p220
aVor we can stay in the streets,
p221
aVdisruptive, messy, loud.
p222
aVThat is what democracy looks like.
p223
aa(lp224
VThank you.
p225
aa(lp226
V(Applause)
p227
aa(lp228
VChris Anderson: First of all, wow.
p229
aVObviously, many people passionately \u2014
p230
aVyou spoke to many people passionately here.
p231
aVI'm sure there are other people here
p232
aVwho'd say, look, Trump was elected by 63 million people.
p233
aVHe's far from perfect,
p234
aVbut he's trying to do what he was elected to do.
p235
aVShouldn't you give him a chance?
p236
aa(lp237
VAnthony Romero: I think we have to recognize
p238
aVthe legitimacy of him as president
p239
aVversus the legitimacy of his policies.
p240
aVAnd when so many of the policies are contrary to fundamental values,
p241
aVthat we're all equal under the law,
p242
aVthat we're not judged by the color of our skin or the religion we worship,
p243
aVwe have to contest those values
p244
aVeven as we recognize and honor the fact
p245
aVthat our democracy rendered us a president who is championing those values.
p246
aa(lp247
VCA: And the ACLU isn't just this force on the left, right?
p248
aVYou're making other arguments as well.
p249
aa(lp250
VAR: Well, you know,
p251
aVvery often we piss everyone off at one point.
p252
aVThat's what we do.
p253
aVAnd we recently were taking stands
p254
aVfor why Ann Coulter needs to be able to speak at Berkeley,
p255
aVand why Milo has free speech rights.
p256
aVAnd we even wrote a blog
p257
aVthat almost burnt the house down among some of our members,
p258
aVunfortunately, when we talked about the fact
p259
aVthat even Donald Trump has free speech rights as president,
p260
aVand an effort to hold him accountable
p261
aVfor incitement of violence at his marches or his rallies
p262
aVis unconstitutional and un-American.
p263
aVAnd when you put that statement out there
p264
aVto a very frothy base
p265
aVthat always is very excited for you to fight Donald Trump,
p266
aVand then you have a new one saying, "Wait, these rights are for everybody,
p267
aVeven the president that we don't like."
p268
aVAnd that's our job.
p269
aa(lp270
V(Applause)
p271
aa(lp272
VCA: Anthony, you spoke to so many of us so powerfully.
p273
aa(lp274
