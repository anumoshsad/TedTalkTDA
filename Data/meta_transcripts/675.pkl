VCompassion:
p4
aVwhat does it look like?
p5
aVCome with me to 915 South Bloodworth Street
p6
aVin Raleigh, North Carolina, where I grew up.
p7
aVIf you come in you will see us: evening time,
p8
aVat table \u2014 set for ten but not always all seats filled \u2014
p9
aVat the point when dinner is ready to be served.
p10
aVSince mom had eight kids,
p11
aVsometimes she said she couldn't tell who was who and where they were.
p12
aVBefore we could eat, she would ask,
p13
aV"Are all the children in?"
p14
aVAnd if someone happened to be missing,
p15
aVwe would have to, we say, "Fix a plate" for that person, put it in the oven,
p16
aVthen we could say grace, and we could eat.
p17
aa(lp18
VAlso, while we were at the table,
p19
aVthere was a ritual in our family:
p20
aVwhen something significant had happened for any one of us \u2014
p21
aVwhether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA,
p22
aVor whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination,
p23
aVor whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent \u2014
p24
aVthe ritual at the family was, once the announcement is made,
p25
aVwe must take five, ten minutes to do what we call "make over" that person \u2014
p26
aVthat is, to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way.
p27
aVFor when one is honored, all are honored.
p28
aa(lp29
VAlso, we had to make a report on our extended "visited" members,
p30
aVthat is, extended members of the family,
p31
aVsick and elderly, shut in.
p32
aVMy task was, at least once a week, to visit Mother Lassiter
p33
aVwho lived on East Street,
p34
aVMother Williamson who lived on Bledsoe Avenue,
p35
aVand Mother Lathers who lived on Oberlin Road.
p36
aVWhy? Because they were old and infirm,
p37
aVand we needed to go by to see if they needed anything.
p38
aVFor mom said, "To be family, is to care and share and to look out for one another.
p39
aVThey are our family."
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd, of course, sometimes there was a bonus for going.
p42
aVThey would offer sweets or money.
p43
aVMom says, "If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them,
p44
aVyou must always say, 'Nothing.'
p45
aVAnd if they insist, say, 'Whatever you mind to give me.'"
p46
aVThis was the nature of being at that table.
p47
aVIn fact, she indicated that if we would do that,
p48
aVnot only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude
p49
aVfrom the members of the extended family,
p50
aVbut she said, "Even God will smile, and when God smiles,
p51
aVthere is peace, and justice, and joy."
p52
aa(lp53
VSo, at the table at 915, I learned something about compassion.
p54
aVOf course, it was a minister's family,
p55
aVso we had to add God into it.
p56
aVAnd so, I came to think that mama eternal, mama eternal,
p57
aVis always wondering: Are all the children in?
p58
aVAnd if we had been faithful in caring and sharing,
p59
aVwe had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world.
p60
aa(lp61
VNow, it was not always wonderful at that table.
p62
aVLet me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion.
p63
aVIt was Christmas, and at our family, oh, what a morning.
p64
aVChristmas morning, where we open up our gifts,
p65
aVwhere we have special prayers, and where we get to the old upright piano
p66
aVand we would sing carols. It was a very intimate moment.
p67
aVIn fact, you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing,
p68
aVand then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed,
p69
aVexcept that daddy messed it up.
p70
aa(lp71
VThere was a member of his staff who did not have any place
p72
aVon that particular Christmas to celebrate.
p73
aVAnd daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration.
p74
aVWe thought he must be out of his mind.
p75
aVThis is our time. This is intimate time.
p76
aVThis is when we can just be who we are,
p77
aVand now we have this stuffy brother
p78
aVwith his shirt and tie on, while we are still in our PJs.
p79
aVWhy would daddy bring Elder Revels?
p80
aVAny other time, but not to the Christmas celebration.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd mom overheard us and said,
p83
aV"Well, you know what? If you really understand the nature of this celebration,
p84
aVit is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love.
p85
aVThat's what the celebration is all about.
p86
aVIt's time to make space, to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community."
p87
aVSo, we sucked up.
p88
aV(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VBut growing up at 915, compassion was not a word to be debated;
p91
aVit was a sensibility to how we are together.
p92
aVWe are sisters and brothers united together.
p93
aVAnd, like Chief Seattle said, "We did not spin the web of life.
p94
aVWe're all strands in it.
p95
aVAnd whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves."
p96
aVNow that's compassion.
p97
aa(lp98
VSo, let me tell you, I kind of look at the world this way.
p99
aVI see pictures, and something says, "Now, that's compassion."
p100
aVA harvested field of grain, with some grain in the corners,
p101
aVreminding me of the Hebrew tradition
p102
aVthat you may indeed harvest,
p103
aVbut you must always leave some on the edges,
p104
aVjust in case there's someone who has not
p105
aVhad the share necessary for good nurture.
p106
aVTalk about a picture of compassion.
p107
aa(lp108
VI see \u2014 always, it stirs my heart \u2014
p109
aVa picture of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
p110
aVwalking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel
p111
aVand maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saints assembled,
p112
aVwalking across the bridge and going into Selma.
p113
aVJust a photograph.
p114
aVArm in arm for struggle.
p115
aVSuffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters
p116
aVwithout the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity
p117
aVrobbing us of a sense of unity of being.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo, there's another picture. Here, this one. I really do like this picture.
p120
aVWhen Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated,
p121
aVthat day, everybody in my community was upset.
p122
aVYou heard about riots all across the land.
p123
aVBobby Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indianapolis.
p124
aVThis is the picture. They said,
p125
aV"It's going to be too volatile for you to go."
p126
aVHe insisted, "I must go."
p127
aa(lp128
VSo, sitting on a flatbed truck,
p129
aVthe elders of the community are there,
p130
aVand Bobby stands up and says to the people,
p131
aV"I have bad news for you.
p132
aVSome of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated.
p133
aVI know that you are angry,
p134
aVand I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity
p135
aVto enter now into activities of revenge. But,"
p136
aVhe said, "what I really want you to know is that I know how you feel.
p137
aVBecause I had someone dear to me snatched away.
p138
aVI know how you feel."
p139
aVAnd he said, "I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did.
p140
aVI allowed my anger, my bitterness, my grief to simmer a while,
p141
aVand then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world,
p142
aVand we can do that together."
p143
aVThat's a picture. Compassion? I think I see it.
p144
aa(lp145
VI saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor,
p146
aVand he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world.
p147
aVHe asked them to give a message,
p148
aVand they each read in their own language a central affirmation,
p149
aVand that was some version of the golden rule:
p150
aV"As you would that others would do unto you,
p151
aVdo also unto them."
p152
aVTwelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire
p153
aVaffirming one message.
p154
aVWe are so connected that we must treat each other
p155
aVas if an action toward you is an action toward myself.
p156
aa(lp157
VOne more picture while I'm stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church:
p158
aV9/11. Last night at Chagrin Fall,
p159
aVa newspaperman and a television guy said,
p160
aV"That evening, when a service was held at the Riverside Church,
p161
aVwe carried it on our station in this city.
p162
aVIt was," he said, "one of the most powerful moments of life together.
p163
aVWe were all suffering.
p164
aVBut you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come,
p165
aVand you invited them.
p166
aV'Find out what it is in your tradition
p167
aVthat tells us what to do when we have been humiliated,
p168
aVwhen we have been despised and rejected.'
p169
aVAnd they all spoke out of their own traditions,
p170
aVa word about the healing power of solidarity, one with the other."
p171
aa(lp172
VI developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature,
p173
aVbut I became a preacher.
p174
aVNow, as a preacher, I got a job. I got to preach the stuff,
p175
aVbut I got to do it too.
p176
aVOr, as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks,
p177
aV"Some people preach the Gospel.
p178
aVI have to tangibilitate the Gospel."
p179
aVSo, the real issue is: How do you tangibilitate compassion?
p180
aVHow do you make it real?
p181
aa(lp182
VMy faith has constantly lifted up the ideal,
p183
aVand challenged me when I fell beneath it.
p184
aVIn my tradition, there is a gift that we have made to other traditions \u2014
p185
aVto everybody around the world who knows the story of the "Good Samaritan."
p186
aVMany people think of it primarily in terms of charity,
p187
aVrandom acts of kindness.
p188
aVBut for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly,
p189
aVyou will discover that a question has been raised
p190
aVthat leads to this parable.
p191
aa(lp192
VThe question was: "What is the greatest commandment?"
p193
aVAnd, according to Jesus, the word comes forth,
p194
aV"You must love yourself,
p195
aVyou must love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul,
p196
aVand your neighbor as yourself."
p197
aa(lp198
VAnd then the person asked, "Well, what do you mean, 'neighbor?'"
p199
aa(lp200
VAnd he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves,
p201
aVand how religious authorities went the other way,
p202
aVand how their supporters in the congregation went the other way;
p203
aVbut an unsuspecting, despised person came along,
p204
aVsaw the man in need,
p205
aVprovided oil and wine for his wounds,
p206
aVput him on his own transportation,
p207
aVand took him to the inn
p208
aVand asked the innkeeper, "Take care of him."
p209
aVAnd he said, "Here, this is the initial investment,
p210
aVbut if needs continue, make sure that you provide them.
p211
aVAnd whatever else is needed, I will provide it and pay for it when I return."
p212
aa(lp213
VThis always seemed to me to be a deepening
p214
aVof the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan.
p215
aVA Good Samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched
p216
aVin an immediate act of care and charity,
p217
aVbut one who provides a system of sustained care \u2014 I like that,
p218
aV'a system of sustained care ' \u2014 in the inn, take care.
p219
aVI think maybe it's one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system
p220
aVand a commitment to do whatever is necessary \u2014
p221
aVthat all God's children would have their needs cared for,
p222
aVso that we could answer when mommy eternal asks, "In regards to health,
p223
aVare all the children in?" And we could say yes.
p224
aa(lp225
VOh, what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion.
p226
aVI recall that my work as a pastor
p227
aVhas always involved caring for their spiritual needs;
p228
aVbeing concerned for housing, for healthcare,
p229
aVfor the prisoners, for the infirm, for children \u2014
p230
aVeven the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record
p231
aVwhere they started off, where they are going.
p232
aVTo be a pastor is to care for these individual needs.
p233
aa(lp234
VBut now, to be a Good Samaritan \u2014 and I always say,
p235
aVand to be a good American \u2014 for me,
p236
aVis not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care.
p237
aVCompassion takes on a corporate dynamic.
p238
aVI believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street
p239
aVmust be done around tables and rituals of faith
p240
aVuntil we become that family, that family together
p241
aVthat understands the nature of our unity.
p242
aVWe are one people together.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo, let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion,
p245
aVand why I think it is so important that right at this point in history.
p246
aVWe would decide to establish this charter of compassion.
p247
aVThe reason it's important is because this is a very special time in history.
p248
aVIt is the time that, biblically, we would speak of as
p249
aVthe day, or the year, of God's favor.
p250
aVThis is a season of grace.
p251
aVUnusual things are beginning to happen.
p252
aVPlease pardon me, as a black man, for celebrating
p253
aVthat the election of Obama was an unusual sign
p254
aVof the fact that it is a year of favor.
p255
aVAnd yet, there is so much more that needs to be done.
p256
aVWe need to bring health and food and education
p257
aVand respect for all God's citizens, all God's children,
p258
aVremembering mama eternal.
p259
aa(lp260
VNow, let me close my comments by telling you
p261
aVthat whenever I feel something very deeply,
p262
aVit usually takes the form of verse.
p263
aVAnd so I want to close with a little song.
p264
aVI close with this song \u2014 it's a children's song \u2014
p265
aVbecause we are all children at the table of mama eternal.
p266
aVAnd if mama eternal has taught us correctly,
p267
aVthis song will make sense, not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering,
p268
aVbut to all who sign the charter for compassion.
p269
aVAnd this is why we do it.
p270
aa(lp271
VThe song says, \u266b "I made heaven so happy today, \u266b
p272
aV\u266b Receiving God's love and giving it away \u266b
p273
aV\u266b When I looked up, heaven smiled at me \u266b
p274
aV\u266b Now, I'm so happy. Can't you see? \u266b
p275
aV\u266b I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? \u266b
p276
aV\u266b Sharing makes me happy, makes heaven happy too \u266b
p277
aV\u266b I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? \u266b
p278
aV\u266b Let me share my happy loving smile with you. \u266b
p279
aa(lp280
VThat's compassion. (Applause)
