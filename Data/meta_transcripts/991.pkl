VThe big residual
p4
aVis always value for money.
p5
aVAll the time we are trying to get value for money.
p6
aVWhat we don't look for
p7
aVis value for many,
p8
aVwhile we are generating value for money.
p9
aVDo we care about those four billion people
p10
aVwhose income levels are less than two dollars a day,
p11
aVthe so-called bottom of the pyramid?
p12
aVWhat are the challenges in getting value for money
p13
aVas well as value for many?
p14
aVWe have described here
p15
aVin terms of the performance
p16
aVand the price.
p17
aVIf you have money, of course, you can get the value.
p18
aVYou can get a Mercedes
p19
aVfor a very high price,
p20
aVvery high performance.
p21
aVBut if you don't have money, what happens?
p22
aVWell, you are to ride a bicycle,
p23
aVcarrying your own weight and also some other weight,
p24
aVso that you can earn the bread for the day.
p25
aVWell, poor do not remain poor;
p26
aVthey become lower-middle-class.
p27
aVAnd if they do so,
p28
aVthen, of course, the conditions improve,
p29
aVand they start riding on scooters.
p30
aVBut the challenge is, again, they don't get much value,
p31
aVbecause they can't afford anything more than the scooter.
p32
aVThe issue is, at that price,
p33
aVcan you give them some extra value?
p34
aVA super value,
p35
aVin terms of their ability to ride in a car,
p36
aVto get that dignity, to get that safety,
p37
aVlooks practically impossible, isn't it.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow, this is something
p40
aVthat we see on Indian streets
p41
aVall the time.
p42
aVBut many people see the same thing
p43
aVand think things differently,
p44
aVand one of them is here, Ratan Tata.
p45
aVThe great thing about our leaders
p46
aVis that, should they not only have passion in their belly,
p47
aVwhich practically all of them have,
p48
aVthey're also very innovative.
p49
aVAn innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done.
p50
aVThey believe that things can be done.
p51
aVBut great leaders like Ratan
p52
aVhave compassion.
p53
aVAnd what you said, Lakshmi, is absolutely true:
p54
aVit's not just Ratan Tata,
p55
aVit's the house of Tatas over time.
p56
aVLet me confirm what she said.
p57
aVYes, I went barefoot
p58
aVuntil I was 12.
p59
aVI struggled to [unclear] day
p60
aVwas a huge issue.
p61
aVAnd when I finished my SSC, the eleventh standard,
p62
aVI stood eleventh among 125,000 students.
p63
aVBut I was about to leave the school,
p64
aVbecause my poor mother couldn't afford schooling.
p65
aVAnd it was [unclear] Tata Trust, which gave me six rupees per month,
p66
aValmost a dollar per month for six years.
p67
aVThat's how I'm standing before you.
p68
aVSo that is the House of Tata.
p69
aV(Applause)
p70
aVInnovation, compassion and passion.
p71
aVThey combine all that.
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd it was that compassion which bothered them,
p74
aVbecause when he saw \u2014 in fact, he told me about eight or nine years ago
p75
aVhow he was driving his own car \u2014
p76
aVhe drives his own car by the way \u2014
p77
aVand he saw in the rain,
p78
aVa family like the one that I showed to you
p79
aVgetting drenched with an infant.
p80
aVAnd then he said, "Well, I must give them a car that they can afford,
p81
aVone lakh car, $2,000 car."
p82
aVOf course, as soon as you say something like this
p83
aVpeople say it is impossible,
p84
aVand that's what was said by Suzuki.
p85
aVHe said, oh, probably he is going to build a three-wheeler
p86
aVwith stepney.
p87
aVAnd you can see the cartoon here.
p88
aVWell they didn't build that. They built a proper car. Nano.
p89
aVAnd mind you, I'm six feet half an inch,
p90
aVRatan is taller than me,
p91
aVand we have ample space in the front
p92
aVand ample space in the back in this particular car.
p93
aVAnd incredible car.
p94
aVAnd of course, nothing succeeds like success;
p95
aVthe cynics then turned around,
p96
aVand one after the other
p97
aVthey also started saying, "Yes, we also want to make a car in the Nano Segment.
p98
aVWe'll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment."
p99
aa(lp100
VHow did this great story unfold,
p101
aVthe making of Nano?
p102
aVLet me tell you a bit about it.
p103
aVFor example, how we started:
p104
aVRatan just began with a five-engineer team,
p105
aVyoung people in their mid-twenties.
p106
aVAnd he said,
p107
aV"Well, I won't define the vehicle for you,
p108
aVbut I will define the cost for you.
p109
aVIt is one lakh, 100,000 rupees,
p110
aVand you are to make it within that."
p111
aVAnd he told them,
p112
aV"Question the unquestionable.
p113
aVStretch the envelope."
p114
aVAnd at a point in time,
p115
aVhe got so engrossed in the whole challenge,
p116
aVthat he himself became a member of the team.
p117
aVCan you believe it?
p118
aVI still am told about this story
p119
aVof that single wiper design in which he participated.
p120
aVUntil midnight, he'd be thinking.
p121
aVEarly morning he'll be coming back with sort of solutions.
p122
aVBut who was the team leader?
p123
aVThe team leader was Girish Wagh,
p124
aVa 34 year-old boy in [unclear].
p125
aVAnd the Nano team average age
p126
aVwas just 27 years.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd they did innovation in design and beyond.
p129
aVBroke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time.
p130
aVFor example, that a two-cylinder gas engine
p131
aVwas used in a car with a single balancer shaft.
p132
aVAdhesives were replacing the rivets.
p133
aVThere was a co-creation, a huge co-creation,
p134
aVwith vendors and suppliers.
p135
aVAll ideas on board were welcome.
p136
aV100 vendors were co-located adjacent to the plant,
p137
aVand innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed.
p138
aVImagine that a fellow
p139
aVwho sells cloth, for example, will be selling Nano.
p140
aVI mean, it was incredible innovation.
p141
aVSeeking solutions for non-auto sectors.
p142
aVIt was an open innovation,
p143
aVideas from all over were welcome.
p144
aVThe mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used, by the way,
p145
aVas well as a dashboard
p146
aVthat was inspired by two-wheelers.
p147
aVThe fuel lines and lamps
p148
aVwere as in two-wheelers.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd the crux of the matter was, however,
p151
aVgetting more from less.
p152
aVAll the time, you have been given an envelope.
p153
aVYou can't cross that envelope,
p154
aVwhich is 100,000 rupees, 2,000 dollars.
p155
aVAnd therefore, each component
p156
aVhad to have a dual functionality.
p157
aVAnd the seat riser, for example,
p158
aVserving as a mounting for the seat
p159
aVas well as a structural part
p160
aVof the functional rigidity.
p161
aVHalf the number of parts
p162
aVare contained in Nano
p163
aVin comparison to a typical passenger car.
p164
aVThe length is smaller by eight percent by the way.
p165
aVBut the current entry-level cars
p166
aVin comparison to that is eight percent less,
p167
aVbut 21 percent more inside space.
p168
aa(lp169
VAnd what happened
p170
aVwas that \u2014 more from less \u2014
p171
aVyou can see how much more for how much less.
p172
aVWhen the Model T was launched \u2014
p173
aVand this is, by the way, all the figures
p174
aVthat are adjusted to 2007 dollar prices \u2014
p175
aVModel T was 19,700 by Ford.
p176
aVVolkswagon was 11,333.
p177
aVAnd British Motor was around 11,000.
p178
aVAnd Nano was, bang, 2,000 dollars.
p179
aVThis is why
p180
aVyou started
p181
aVactually a new paradigm shift,
p182
aVwhere the same people
p183
aVwho could not dream of sitting in a car,
p184
aVwho were carrying their entire family in a scooter,
p185
aVstarted dreaming of being in a car.
p186
aVAnd those dreams are getting fulfilled.
p187
aVThis is a photograph
p188
aVof a house and a driver and a car
p189
aVnear my own home.
p190
aVThe driver's name is Naran.
p191
aVHe has bought his own Nano.
p192
aVAnd you can see, there is a physical space
p193
aVthat has been created for him,
p194
aVparking that car, along with the owner's car,
p195
aVbut more importantly, they've created
p196
aVa space in their mind that
p197
aV"Yes, my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it."
p198
aVAnd that's why I call it a transformational innovation.
p199
aVIt is not just technological,
p200
aVit is social innovation that we talk about.
p201
aa(lp202
VAnd that is where, ladies and gentlemen,
p203
aVthis famous theme
p204
aVof getting more from less for more
p205
aVbecomes important.
p206
aVI remember talking about this for the first time in Australia,
p207
aVabout one and a half years ago,
p208
aVwhen their academy honored me with a fellowship.
p209
aVAnd unbelievably, in 40 years,
p210
aVI was the first Indian to be honored.
p211
aVAnd the title of my talk
p212
aVwas therefore "Indian innovation
p213
aVfrom Gandhi to Gandhian engineering."
p214
aVAnd I titled this more from less for more and more people
p215
aVas Gandhian engineering.
p216
aVAnd Gandhian engineering, in my judgment,
p217
aVis the one which is going to take the world forward,
p218
aVis going to make a difference,
p219
aVnot just for a few, but for everyone.
p220
aVLet me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility
p221
aVfor those unfortunates
p222
aVwho have lost their legs.
p223
aVHere is an American citizen and his son
p224
aVhaving an artificial foot.
p225
aVWhat is its price? 20,000 dollars.
p226
aVAnd of course, these feet are so designed
p227
aVthat they can walk only on
p228
aVsuch perfect pavement or roads.
p229
aa(lp230
VUnfortunately, that's not the case in India.
p231
aVYou can see him walk barefoot
p232
aVon an awkward land, sometimes in a marshy land,
p233
aVand so on and so forth.
p234
aVMore importantly,
p235
aVthey not only walk far to work,
p236
aVand not only do they cycle to work,
p237
aVbut they cycle for work, as you can see here.
p238
aVAnd they climb up for their work.
p239
aVYou have to design an artificial foot for such conditions.
p240
aVA challenge, of course.
p241
aVFour billion people, their incomes are less then two dollars a day.
p242
aVAnd if you talk about a 20,000-dollar shoe,
p243
aVyou're talking about 10,000 days of income.
p244
aVYou just don't have it.
p245
aVAnd therefore, you ought to look at alternatives.
p246
aa(lp247
VAnd that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India.
p248
aVIt had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system,
p249
aVa quick molding and modular components,
p250
aVenabling custom-made, on-the-spot limb fitments.
p251
aVYou could feel it actually in an hour, by the way,
p252
aVwhereas the equivalent other feet
p253
aVtook something like a day, as so on.
p254
aVOuter socket made by using heated high-density polyethylene pipes,
p255
aVrather than using heated sheets.
p256
aVAnd unique high-ankle design and human-like looks,
p257
aV[unclear] and functions.
p258
aVAnd I like to show how it looks
p259
aVand how it works.
p260
aV(Music)
p261
aVSee, he jumps. You can see what stress it must have.
p262
aa(lp263
V(Text: ... any person with a below the knee limb could do this.
p264
aV... above the limb, yes, it would be difficult ...
p265
aV"Did it hurt?"
p266
aV"No ... not at all."
p267
aV... he can run a kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds ...)
p268
aa(lp269
VOne kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds.
p270
aV(Applause)
p271
aVSo that's what it is all about.
p272
aVAnd therefore Time took notice
p273
aVof this 28-dollar foot, basically.
p274
aV(Applause)
p275
aVAn incredible story.
p276
aa(lp277
VLet's move on to something else.
p278
aVI've been talking about getting more from less for more.
p279
aVLet's move to health.
p280
aVWe've talked about mobility and the rest of it, let's talk about health.
p281
aVWhat's happening in the area of health?
p282
aVYou know, you have new diseases that require new drugs.
p283
aVAnd if you look at the drug development 10 years ago and now,
p284
aVwhat has happened?
p285
aV10 years ago, it used to cost about a quarter billion.
p286
aVToday it costs 1.5 billion dollars.
p287
aVTime taken for moving a molecule to marketplace,
p288
aVafter all the human and animal testing,
p289
aVwas 10 years, now it is 15 years.
p290
aVAre you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money?
p291
aVNo, I'm sorry.
p292
aVWe used to have 40, now they have come down to 30.
p293
aVSo actually we are getting less from more
p294
aVfor less and less people.
p295
aVWhy less and less people? Because it is so expensive,
p296
aVso very few will be able to basically afford that.
p297
aa(lp298
VLet us just take an example.
p299
aVPsoriasis is very dreadful
p300
aVdisease of the skin.
p301
aVThe cost of treatment, 20,000 dollars.
p302
aV1,000-dollar antibody injections under the skin, by the way,
p303
aVand 20 of them.
p304
aVTime for development \u2014 it took around 10 years
p305
aVand 700 million dollars.
p306
aVLet's start in the spirit
p307
aVof more from less and more for more
p308
aVand start putting some targets.
p309
aVFor example, we don't want 20,000 dollars; we don't have it.
p310
aVCan we do it [for] 100 dollars?
p311
aVTime for development, not 10 years.
p312
aVWe are in a hurry. Five years.
p313
aVCost of development \u2014 300 million dollars.
p314
aVSorry. I can't spend more than 10 million dollars.
p315
aVLooks absolutely audacious.
p316
aVLooks absolutely ridiculous.
p317
aa(lp318
VYou know something? This has been achieved in India.
p319
aVThese targets have been achieved in India.
p320
aVAnd how they have been achieved ...
p321
aVSir Francis Bacon once said,
p322
aV"When you wish to achieve results
p323
aVthat have not been achieved before,
p324
aVit is an unwise fancy to think
p325
aVthat they can be achieved by using methods
p326
aVthat have been used before."
p327
aVAnd therefore, the standard process,
p328
aVwhere you develop a molecule, put it into mice, into men,
p329
aVare not yielding those results \u2014
p330
aVthe billions of dollars that have been spent.
p331
aVThe Indian cleverness
p332
aVwas using its traditional knowledge,
p333
aVhowever, scientifically validating it
p334
aVand making that journey from men to mice to men,
p335
aVnot molecule to mice to men, you know.
p336
aVAnd that is how this difference has come.
p337
aVAnd you can see this blending
p338
aVof traditional medicine, modern medicine, modern science.
p339
aVI launched a big program
p340
aV[unclear] CSIR about nine years ago.
p341
aVHe is giving us not just for Psoriasis,
p342
aVfor cancer and a whole range of things, changing the whole paradigm.
p343
aVAnd you can see this Indian Psoriasis breakthrough
p344
aVobtained by this reverse form of [unclear]
p345
aVby doing things differently.
p346
aVYou can see before treatment and after treatment.
p347
aVThis is really getting more from less for more and more people,
p348
aVbecause these are all affordable treatments now.
p349
aa(lp350
VLet me just remind you
p351
aVof what Mahatma Gandhi had said.
p352
aVHe had said, "Earth provides enough
p353
aVto satisfy every man's need, but not every man's greed."
p354
aVSo the message he was giving us
p355
aVwas you must get more from less and less and less
p356
aVso that you can share it for more and more people,
p357
aVnot only the current generation,
p358
aVbut the future generations.
p359
aVAnd he also said, "I would prize every invention of science
p360
aVmade for the benefit for all."
p361
aVSo he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people,
p362
aVnot just a few people.
p363
aVAnd therefore, ladies and gentlemen,
p364
aVthis is the theme, getting more
p365
aVfrom less for more.
p366
aVAnd mind you,
p367
aVit is not getting just a little more for just a little less.
p368
aVIt's not about low cost.
p369
aVIt's about ultra-low cost.
p370
aVYou cannot say it's a mere treatment 10,000 dollars,
p371
aVbut because you are poor I'll give it for 9,000.
p372
aVSorry, it doesn't work. You have to give it for 100 dollars, 200 dollars.
p373
aVIs it possible? It has been made possible, by the way,
p374
aVfor certain other different reasons.
p375
aVSo you are not talking about low cost, you are talking about ultra-low cost.
p376
aVYou are not talking about affordability,
p377
aVyou are talking about extreme affordability.
p378
aVBecause of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day.
p379
aVYou're not talking exclusive innovation.
p380
aVYou're talking about inclusive innovation.
p381
aVAnd therefore, you're not talking about incremental innovation,
p382
aVyou're talking about disruptive innovation.
p383
aVThe ideas have to be such
p384
aVthat you think in completely different terms.
p385
aVAnd I would also add,
p386
aVit is not only getting more from less for more
p387
aVby more and more people, the whole world working for it.
p388
aa(lp389
VI was very touched when I saw a breakthrough the other day.
p390
aVYou know, incubators for infants, for example.
p391
aVThey're not available in Africa.
p392
aVThey're not available in Indian villages.
p393
aVAnd infants die.
p394
aVAnd incubator costs 2,000 dollars.
p395
aVAnd there's a 25-dollar incubator
p396
aVgiving that performance that had been created.
p397
aVAnd by whom?
p398
aVBy young students from Standford University
p399
aVon an extreme affordability project that they had, basically.
p400
aVTheir heart is in the right place, like Ratan Tata.
p401
aVIt's not just innovation, compassion and passion \u2014
p402
aVcompassion in the heart and passion in the belly.
p403
aVThat's the new world that we want to create.
p404
aVAnd that is why the message is that of Gandhian engineering.
p405
aa(lp406
VLadies and gentlemen, I'd like to end before time.
p407
aVI was also afraid of those 18 minutes.
p408
aVI've still one and a half to go.
p409
aVThe message, the final message, is this:
p410
aVIndia gave a great gift to the world.
p411
aVWhat was that?
p412
aV[In the] 20th century, we gave Gandhi to the world.
p413
aVThe 21st century gift,
p414
aVwhich is very, very important for the whole world,
p415
aVwhether it is global economic meltdown,
p416
aVwhether it is climate change \u2014
p417
aVany problem that you talk about
p418
aVis gaining more from less for more and more \u2014
p419
aVnot only the current generations,
p420
aVfor the future generations.
p421
aVAnd that can come only from Gandhian engineering.
p422
aVSo ladies and gentlemen, I'm very happy to announce,
p423
aVthis gift of the 21st century
p424
aVto the world from India,
p425
aVGandhian engineering.
p426
aa(lp427
V(Applause)
p428
aa(lp429
VLakshmi Pratury: Thank you, Dr. Mashelkar. (R.A. Mashelkar: Thank you very much.)
p430
aa(lp431
VLP: A quick question for you.
p432
aVNow, when you were a young boy in this school,
p433
aVwhat were your thoughts, like what did you think you could become?
p434
aVWhat do you think that drove you?
p435
aVWas there a vision you had? What is it that drove you?
p436
aa(lp437
VRAM: I'll tell you a story that drove me, that transformed my life.
p438
aVI remember, I went to a poor school,
p439
aVbecause my mother could not gather the 21 rupees,
p440
aVthat half a dollar that was required
p441
aVwithin the stipulated time.
p442
aVIt was [unclear] high school.
p443
aVBut it was a poor school with rich teachers, honestly.
p444
aVAnd one of them was [unclear] who taught us physics.
p445
aVOne day he took us out into the sun
p446
aVand tried to show us how to find
p447
aVthe focal length of a convex lens.
p448
aVThe lens was here. The piece of paper was there. He moved it up and down.
