VI made a film that was impossible to make,
p4
aVbut I didn't know it was impossible,
p5
aVand that's how I was able to do it.
p6
aa(lp7
V"Mars et Avril" is a science fiction film.
p8
aVIt's set in Montreal some 50 years in the future.
p9
aVNo one had done that kind of movie in Quebec before
p10
aVbecause it's expensive, it's set in the future,
p11
aVand it's got tons of visual effects,
p12
aVand it's shot on green screen.
p13
aVYet this is the kind of movie that I wanted to make
p14
aVever since I was a kid, really,
p15
aVback when I was reading some comic books
p16
aVand dreaming about what the future might be.
p17
aa(lp18
VWhen American producers see my film,
p19
aVthey think that I had a big budget to do it,
p20
aVlike 23 million.
p21
aVBut in fact I had 10 percent of that budget.
p22
aVI did "Mars et Avril" for only 2.3 million.
p23
aa(lp24
VSo you might wonder, what's the deal here?
p25
aVHow did I do this?
p26
aVWell, it's two things. First, it's time.
p27
aVWhen you don't have money, you must take time,
p28
aVand it took me seven years to do "Mars et Avril."
p29
aVThe second aspect is love.
p30
aVI got tons and tons of generosity from everyone involved.
p31
aVAnd it seems like every department had nothing,
p32
aVso they had to rely on our creativity
p33
aVand turn every problem into an opportunity.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd that brings me to the point of my talk, actually,
p36
aVhow constraints, big creative constraints, can boost creativity.
p37
aa(lp38
VBut let me go back in time a bit.
p39
aVIn my early 20s, I did some graphic novels,
p40
aVbut they weren't your usual graphic novels.
p41
aVThey were books telling a science fiction story
p42
aVthrough images and text,
p43
aVand most of the actors who are now starring
p44
aVin the movie adaptation, they were already involved
p45
aVin these books portraying characters
p46
aVinto a sort of experimental, theatrical, simplistic way.
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd one of these actors is the great stage director
p49
aVand actor Robert Lepage.
p50
aVAnd I just love this guy.
p51
aVI've been in love with this guy since I was a kid.
p52
aVHis career I admire a lot.
p53
aVAnd I wanted this guy to be involved in my crazy project,
p54
aVand he was kind enough to lend his image
p55
aVto the character of Eugène Spaak,
p56
aVwho is a cosmologist and artist who seeks relation
p57
aVin between time, space, love, music and women.
p58
aVAnd he was a perfect fit for the part,
p59
aVand Robert is actually the one who gave me my first chance.
p60
aVHe was the one who believed in me
p61
aVand encouraged me to do an adaptation of my books
p62
aVinto a film, and to write, direct,
p63
aVand produce the film myself.
p64
aa(lp65
VAnd Robert is actually the very first example
p66
aVof how constraints can boost creativity.
p67
aVBecause this guy is the busiest man on the planet.
p68
aVI mean, his agenda is booked until 2042,
p69
aVand he's really hard to get,
p70
aVand I wanted him to be in the movie,
p71
aVto reprise his role in the movie.
p72
aVBut the thing is, had I waited
p73
aVfor him until 2042, my film wouldn't be
p74
aVa futuristic film anymore, so I just couldn't do that. Right?
p75
aVBut that's kind of a big problem.
p76
aVHow do you get somebody who is too busy
p77
aVto star in a movie?
p78
aa(lp79
VWell, I said as a joke in a production meeting \u2014
p80
aVand this is a true story, by the way \u2014
p81
aVI said, "Why don't we turn this guy into a hologram?
p82
aVBecause, you know, he is everywhere
p83
aVand nowhere on the planet at the same time,
p84
aVand he's an illuminated being in my mind,
p85
aVand he's in between reality and virtual reality,
p86
aVso it would make perfect sense
p87
aVto turn this guy into a hologram."
p88
aa(lp89
VEverybody around the table laughed,
p90
aVbut the joke was kind of a good solution,
p91
aVso that's what we ended up doing.
p92
aa(lp93
VHere's how we did it. We shot Robert with six cameras.
p94
aVHe was dressed in green and he was like
p95
aVin a green aquarium.
p96
aVEach camera was covering 60 degrees of his head,
p97
aVso that in post-production we could use
p98
aVpretty much any angle we needed,
p99
aVand we shot only his head.
p100
aVSix months later there was a guy on set,
p101
aVa mime portraying the body,
p102
aVthe vehicle for the head.
p103
aVAnd he was wearing a green hood
p104
aVso that we could erase the green hood in postproduction
p105
aVand replace it with Robert Lepage's head.
p106
aVSo he became like a renaissance man,
p107
aVand here's what it looks like in the movie.
p108

aa(lp111
V(Video) Robert Lepage: [As usual, Arthur's drawing
p112
aVdidn't account for the technical challenges.
p113
aVI welded the breech, but the valve is still gaping.
p114
aVI tried to lift the pallets to lower the pressure in the sound box,
p115
aVbut I might have hit a heartstring.
p116
aVIt still sounds too low.]
p117
aVJacques Languirand: [That's normal.
p118
aVThe instrument always ends up resembling its model.]
p119
aV(Music)
p120
aa(lp121
VMartin Villeneuve: Now these musical instruments
p122
aVthat you see in this excerpt,
p123
aVthey're my second example of how
p124
aVconstraints can boost creativity,
p125
aVbecause I desperately needed these objects in my movie.
p126
aVThey are objects of desire.
p127
aVThey are imaginary musical instruments.
p128
aVAnd they carry a nice story with them.
p129
aVActually, I knew what these things would look like
p130
aVin my mind for many, many years.
p131
aVBut my problem was, I didn't have the money
p132
aVto pay for them. I couldn't afford them.
p133
aVSo that's kind of a big problem too.
p134
aVHow do you get something that you can't afford?
p135
aa(lp136
VAnd, you know, I woke up one morning with a pretty good idea.
p137
aVI said, "What if I have somebody else pay for them?"
p138
aV(Laughter)
p139
aa(lp140
VBut who on Earth would be interested
p141
aVby seven not-yet-built musical instruments
p142
aVinspired by women's bodies?
p143
aVAnd I thought of Cirque du Soleil in Montreal,
p144
aVbecause who better to understand the kind of
p145
aVcrazy poetry that I wanted to put on screen?
p146
aVSo I found my way to Guy Laliberté, Cirque du Soleil's CEO,
p147
aVand I presented my crazy idea to him
p148
aVwith sketches like this and visual references,
p149
aVand something pretty amazing happened.
p150
aVGuy was interested by this idea
p151
aVnot because I was asking for his money,
p152
aVbut because I came to him with a good idea
p153
aVin which everybody was happy.
p154
aVIt was kind of a perfect triangle
p155
aVin which the art buyer was happy
p156
aVbecause he got the instruments at a cheaper price,
p157
aVbecause they weren't even made.
p158
aVHe took a leap of faith.
p159
aVAnd the artist, Dominique Engel, brilliant guy,
p160
aVhe was happy too because he had a dream project
p161
aVto work on for a year.
p162
aVAnd obviously I was happy because I got the instruments
p163
aVin my film for free, which was kind of what I tried to do.
p164
aVSo here they are.
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd my last example of how constraints
p167
aVcan boost creativity
p168
aVcomes from the green,
p169
aVbecause this is a weird color, a crazy color,
p170
aVand you need to replace the green screens eventually
p171
aVand you must figure that out sooner rather than later.
p172
aVAnd I had, again, pretty much, ideas in my mind
p173
aVas to what the world would be,
p174
aVbut then again I turned to my childhood imagination
p175
aVand went to the work of Belgian comic book master
p176
aVFrançois Schuiten in Belgium.
p177
aVAnd this guy is another guy I admire a lot,
p178
aVand I wanted him to be involved in the movie
p179
aVas a production designer.
p180
aVBut people told me, you know, Martin, it's impossible,
p181
aVthe guy is too busy and he will say no.
p182
aVWell, I said, you know what, instead of mimicking his style,
p183
aVI might as well call the real guy and ask him,
p184
aVand I sent him my books,
p185
aVand he answered that he was interested
p186
aVin working on the film with me
p187
aVbecause he could be a big fish in a small aquarium.
p188
aVIn other words, there was space for him to dream with me.
p189
aVSo here I was with one of my childhood heroes,
p190
aVdrawing every single frame that's in the film
p191
aVto turn that into Montreal in the future.
p192
aVAnd it was an amazing collaboration
p193
aVto work with this great artist whom I admire.
p194
aa(lp195
VBut then, you know, eventually you have to turn
p196
aVall these drawings into reality.
p197
aVSo, again, my solution was to aim
p198
aVfor the best possible artist that I could think of.
p199
aVAnd there's this guy in Montreal, another Quebecois
p200
aVcalled Carlos Monzon, and he's a very good VFX artist.
p201
aVThis guy had been lead compositor on such films
p202
aVas "Avatar" and "Star Trek" and "Transformers,"
p203
aVand other unknown projects like this,
p204
aVand I knew he was the perfect fit for the job,
p205
aVand I had to convince him,
p206
aVand, instead of working on the next Spielberg movie,
p207
aVhe accepted to work on mine.
p208
aVWhy? Because I offered him a space to dream.
p209
aVSo if you don't have money to offer to people,
p210
aVyou must strike their imagination with something
p211
aVas nice as you can think of.
p212
aa(lp213
VSo this is what happened on this movie,
p214
aVand that's how it got made,
p215
aVand we went to this very nice postproduction company
p216
aVin Montreal called Vision Globale,
p217
aVand they lent their 60 artists to work full time
p218
aVfor six months to do this crazy film.
p219
aa(lp220
VSo I want to tell you that, if you have some crazy ideas
p221
aVin your mind, and that people tell you
p222
aVthat it's impossible to make,
p223
aVwell, that's an even better reason to want to do it,
p224
aVbecause people have a tendency
p225
aVto see the problems rather than the final result,
p226
aVwhereas if you start to deal with problems
p227
aVas being your allies rather than your opponents,
p228
aVlife will start to dance with you
p229
aVin the most amazing way.
p230
aVI have experienced it.
p231
aVAnd you might end up doing some crazy projects,
p232
aVand who knows, you might even end up
p233
aVgoing to Mars.
p234
aa(lp235
VThank you.
