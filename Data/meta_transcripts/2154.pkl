VHas anyone among you ever been exposed to tear gas?
p4
aVTear gas? Anyone?
p5
aVI'm sorry to hear that, so you might know that it's a very toxic substance,
p6
aVbut you might not know that it's a very simple molecule
p7
aVwith an unpronouncable name:
p8
aVit's called chlorobenzalmalononitrile.
p9
aVI made it.
p10
aVIt's decades old, but it's becoming very trendy among police forces
p11
aVaround the planet lately, it seems,
p12
aVand according to my experience as a non-voluntary breather of it,
p13
aVtear gas has two main but quite opposite effects.
p14
aVOne, it can really burn your eyes,
p15
aVand two, it can also help you to open them.
p16
aa(lp17
VTear gas definitely helped to open mine to something
p18
aVthat I want to share with you this afternoon:
p19
aVthat livestreaming the power of independent broadcasts through the web
p20
aVcan be a game-changer in journalism,
p21
aVin activism, and as I see it, in the political discourse as well.
p22
aa(lp23
VThat idea started  to dawn on me in early 2011
p24
aVwhen I was covering a protest in São Paulo.
p25
aVIt was the marijuana march,
p26
aVa gathering of people asking for the legalization of cannabis.
p27
aVWhen that group started to move,
p28
aVthe riot police came from the back with rubber bullets, bombs,
p29
aVand then the gas.
p30
aVBut to make a long story short,
p31
aVI had entered that protest as the editor-in-chief
p32
aVof a well-established printed magazine where I'd worked for 11 years,
p33
aVand thanks to this unsolicited effects of tear gas,
p34
aVI left it as a journalist that was now committed to new ways
p35
aVof sharing the raw experience of what it's like to be there, actually.
p36
aa(lp37
VSo in the following week, I was back in the streets,
p38
aVbut that time, I wasn't a member of any media outlet anymore.
p39
aVI was there as an independent livestreamer, and all I had with me
p40
aVwas basically borrowed equipment.
p41
aVI had a very simple camera and a backpack with 3G modems.
p42
aVAnd I had this weblink that could be shared through social media,
p43
aVcould be put in any website,
p44
aVand that time, the protest went along fine.
p45
aVThere was no violence.
p46
aVThere was no action scenes.
p47
aVBut there was something really exciting,
p48
aVbecause I could see at a distance the TV channels covering it,
p49
aVand they had these big vans and the teams and the cameras,
p50
aVand I was basically doing the same thing
p51
aVand all I had was a backpack.
p52
aVAnd that was really exciting to a journalist,
p53
aVbut the most interesting part was when I got back home, actually,
p54
aVbecause I learned that I had been watched
p55
aVby more than 90,000 people,
p56
aVand I got hundreds of emails and messages of people asking me, basically,
p57
aVhow did I do it,
p58
aVhow it was possible to do such a thing.
p59
aa(lp60
VAnd I learned something else, that that was actually the first time
p61
aVthat somebody had ever done a livestreaming in a street protest
p62
aVin the country.
p63
aVAnd that really shocked me,
p64
aVbecause I was no geek, I was no technology guy,
p65
aVand all the equipment needed was already there,
p66
aVwas easily available.
p67
aVAnd I realized that we had a frontier here,
p68
aVa very important one,
p69
aVthat it was just a matter of changing the perspective,
p70
aVand the web could be actually used,
p71
aValready used, as a colossal and uncontrollable
p72
aVand highly anarchical TV channel, TV network,
p73
aVand anyone with very basic skills and very basic equipment,
p74
aVeven someone like me who had this little stuttering issue,
p75
aVso if it happens, bear with me please,
p76
aVeven someone like me could become a broadcaster.
p77
aVAnd that sounded revolutionary in my mind.
p78
aa(lp79
VSo for the next couple of years,
p80
aVI started to experiment with livestreaming in different ways,
p81
aVnot only in the streets but mostly in studios and in homes,
p82
aVuntil the beginning of 2013, last year,
p83
aVwhen I became the cofounder of a group called Mídia NINJA.
p84
aVNINJA is an acronym
p85
aVthat stands for Narrativas Independentes  Jornalismo e Ação,
p86
aVor in English, independent narratives, journalism, and action.
p87
aVIt was a media group that had little media plan.
p88
aVWe didn't have any financial structure.
p89
aVWe were not planning to make money out of this,
p90
aVwhich was wise, because you shouldn't try to make money out of journalism now.
p91
aVBut we had a very solid and clear conviction,
p92
aVthat we knew that the hyperconnected environment of social media
p93
aVcould maybe allow us to consolidate
p94
aVa network of experimental journalists throughout the country.
p95
aVSo we launched a Facebook page first, and then a manifesto,
p96
aVand started to cover the streets in a very simple way.
p97
aa(lp98
VBut then something happened, something that wasn't predicted,
p99
aVthat no one could have anticipated.
p100
aVStreet protests started to erupt in São Paulo.
p101
aVThey began as very local and specific.
p102
aVThey were against the bus fare hike that had just happened in the city.
p103
aVThis is a bus.
p104
aVIt's written there, "Theft."
p105
aVBut those kind of manifestations started to grow,
p106
aVand they kept happening.
p107
aVSo the police violence against them started to grow as well.
p108
aVBut there was another conflict,
p109
aVthe one I believe that's more important here
p110
aVto make my point that it was a narrative conflict.
p111
aVThere was this mainstream media version of the facts
p112
aVthat anyone who was on the streets could easily challenge
p113
aVif they presented their own vision of what was actually happening there.
p114
aVAnd it was this clash of visions, this clash of narratives,
p115
aVthat I think turned those protests
p116
aVinto a long period in the country of political reckoning
p117
aVwhere hundreds of thousands of people,
p118
aVprobably more than a million people
p119
aVtook to the streets in the whole country.
p120
aa(lp121
VBut it wasn't about the bus fare hike anymore.
p122
aVIt was about everything.
p123
aVThe people's demands, their expectations,
p124
aVthe reasons why they were on the streets
p125
aVcould be as diverse as they could be contradictory in many cases.
p126
aVIf you could read it, you would understand me.
p127
aVBut it was in this environment of political catharsis
p128
aVthat the country was going through
p129
aVthat it had to do with politics, indeed,
p130
aVbut it had to do also with a new way of organizing,
p131
aVthrough a new way of communicating.
p132
aVIt was in that environment that Mídia NINJA emerged
p133
aVfrom almost anonymity to become a national phenomenon,
p134
aVbecause we did have the right equipment.
p135
aVWe are not using big cameras.
p136
aVWe are using basically this.
p137
aVWe are using smartphones.
p138
aVAnd that, actually, allowed us to become invisible in the middle of the protests,
p139
aVbut it allowed us to do something else:
p140
aVto show what it was like to be in the protests,
p141
aVto present to people at home a subjective perspective.
p142
aa(lp143
VBut there was something that is more important,
p144
aVI think, than the equipment.
p145
aVIt was our mindset,
p146
aVbecause we are not behaving as a media outlet.
p147
aVWe are not competing for news.
p148
aVWe are trying to encourage people,
p149
aVto invite people, and to actually teach people
p150
aVhow to do this, how they also could become broadcasters.
p151
aVAnd that was crucial to turn Mídia NINJA from a small group of people,
p152
aVand in a matter of weeks,
p153
aVwe multiplied and we grew exponentially throughout the country.
p154
aVSo in a matter of a week or two, as the protests kept happening,
p155
aVwe were hundreds of young people
p156
aVconnected in this network throughout the country.
p157
aVWe were covering more than 50 cities at the same time.
p158
aVThat's something that no TV channel could ever do.
p159
aVThat was responsible for turning us suddenly, actually,
p160
aVinto kind of the mainstream media of social media.
p161
aVSo we had a couple of thousands of followers on our Facebook page,
p162
aVand soon we had a quarter of a million followers.
p163
aVOur posts and our videos
p164
aVwere being seen by more than 11 million timelines a week.
p165
aVIt was way more than any newspaper or any magazine could ever do.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd that turned Mídia NINJA into something else,
p168
aVmore than a media outlet, than a media project.
p169
aVIt became almost like a public service
p170
aVto the citizen, to the protester,
p171
aVto the activist,
p172
aVbecause they had a very simple and efficient and peaceful tool
p173
aVto confront both police and media authority.
p174
aVMany of our images started  to be used in regular TV channels.
p175
aVOur livestreams started to be broadcast even in regular televisions
p176
aVwhen things got really rough.
p177
aVSome our images were responsible to take some people out of jail,
p178
aVpeople who were being arrested unfairly
p179
aVunder false accusations, and we could prove them innocent.
p180
aVAnd that also turned Mídia NINJA very soon
p181
aVto be seen as almost an enemy of cops, unfortunately,
p182
aVand we started to be severely beaten, and eventually arrested on the streets.
p183
aVIt happened in many cases.
p184
aVBut that was also useful, because we were still at the web,
p185
aVso that helped to trigger an important debate in the country
p186
aVon the role of the media itself
p187
aVand the state of the freedom of the press in the country.
p188
aa(lp189
VSo Mídia NINJA now evolved
p190
aVand finally consolidated itself in what we hoped it would become:
p191
aVa national network of hundreds of young people,
p192
aVself-organizing themselves locally
p193
aVto cover social, human rights issues,
p194
aVand expressing themselves not only politically
p195
aVbut journalistically.
p196
aa(lp197
VWhat I started to do in the beginning of this year,
p198
aVas Mídia NINJA is already a self-organizing network,
p199
aVI'm dedicating myself to another project.
p200
aVIt's called Fluxo, which is Portuguese for "stream."
p201
aVIt's a journalism studio in São Paulo downtown,
p202
aVwhere I used livestream to experiment
p203
aVwith what I call post-television formats.
p204
aVBut I'm also trying to come up with ways to finance independent journalism
p205
aVthrough a direct relationship with an audience,
p206
aVwith an active audience,
p207
aVbecause now I really want to try to make a living
p208
aVout of my tear gas resolution back then.
p209
aa(lp210
VBut there's something more significant here,
p211
aVsomething that I believe is more important and more crucial than my personal example.
p212
aVI said that livestream could turn the web into a colossal TV network,
p213
aVbut I believe it does something else,
p214
aVbecause after watching people using it,
p215
aVnot only to cover things but to express, to organize themselves politically,
p216
aVI believe livestream can turn cyberspace into a global political arena
p217
aVwhere everyone might have a voice,
p218
aVa proper voice,
p219
aVbecause livestream takes the monopoly of the broadcast political discourse,
p220
aVof the verbal aspect of the political dialogue
p221
aVout of the mouths of just politicians and political pundits alone,
p222
aVand it empowers the citizen through this direct and non-mediated power
p223
aVof exchanging experiences and dialogue,
p224
aVempowers them to question and to influence authorities
p225
aVin ways in which we are about to see.
p226
aa(lp227
VAnd I believe it does something else that might be even more important,
p228
aVthat the simplicity of the technology can merge objectivity and subjectivity
p229
aVin a very political way, as I see it,
p230
aVbecause it really helps the audience,
p231
aVthe citizen, to see the world through somebody else's eye,
p232
aVso it helps the citizen to put him- or herself
p233
aVin other people's place.
p234
aVAnd that idea, I think,  should be the intention,
p235
aVshould be the goal of any good journalism, any good activism,
p236
aVbut most of all, any good politics.
