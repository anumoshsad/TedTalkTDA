VApproximately 30 years ago,
p4
aVwhen I was in oncology at the Children's Hospital
p5
aVin Philadelphia,
p6
aVa father and a son walked into my office
p7
aVand they both had their right eye missing,
p8
aVand as I took the history, it became apparent
p9
aVthat the father and the son had a rare form
p10
aVof inherited eye tumor, retinoblastoma,
p11
aVand the father knew that he had passed that fate
p12
aVon to his son.
p13
aa(lp14
VThat moment changed my life.
p15
aVIt propelled me to go on
p16
aVand to co-lead a team that discovered
p17
aVthe first cancer susceptibility gene,
p18
aVand in the intervening decades since then,
p19
aVthere has been literally a seismic shift
p20
aVin our understanding of what goes on,
p21
aVwhat genetic variations are sitting behind
p22
aVvarious diseases.
p23
aVIn fact, for thousands of human traits,
p24
aVa molecular basis that's known for that,
p25
aVand for thousands of people, every day,
p26
aVthere's information that they gain
p27
aVabout the risk of going on to get this disease
p28
aVor that disease.
p29
aa(lp30
VAt the same time, if you ask,
p31
aV"Has that impacted the efficiency,
p32
aVhow we've been able to develop drugs?"
p33
aVthe answer is not really.
p34
aVIf you look at the cost of developing drugs,
p35
aVhow that's done, it basically hasn't budged that.
p36
aVAnd so it's as if we have the power to diagnose
p37
aVyet not the power to fully treat.
p38
aVAnd there are two commonly given reasons
p39
aVfor why that happens.
p40
aVOne of them is it's early days.
p41
aVWe're just learning the words, the fragments,
p42
aVthe letters in the genetic code.
p43
aVWe don't know how to read the sentences.
p44
aVWe don't know how to follow the narrative.
p45
aVThe other reason given is that
p46
aVmost of those changes are a loss of function,
p47
aVand it's actually really hard to develop drugs
p48
aVthat restore function.
p49
aa(lp50
VBut today, I want us to step back
p51
aVand ask a more fundamental question,
p52
aVand ask, "What happens if we're thinking
p53
aVabout this maybe in the wrong context?"
p54
aVWe do a lot of studying of those who are sick
p55
aVand building up long lists
p56
aVof altered components.
p57
aVBut maybe, if what we're trying to do
p58
aVis to develop therapies for prevention,
p59
aVmaybe what we should be doing
p60
aVis studying those who don't get sick.
p61
aVMaybe we should be studying those
p62
aVthat are well.
p63
aVA vast majority of those people
p64
aVare not necessarily carrying a particular
p65
aVgenetic load or risk factor.
p66
aVThey're not going to help us.
p67
aVThere are going to be those individuals
p68
aVwho are carrying a potential future risk,
p69
aVthey're going to go on to get some symptom.
p70
aVThat's not what we're looking for.
p71
aVWhat we're asking and looking for is,
p72
aVare there a very few set of individuals
p73
aVwho are actually walking around
p74
aVwith the risk that normally would cause a disease,
p75
aVbut something in them, something hidden in them
p76
aVis actually protective
p77
aVand keeping them from exhibiting those symptoms?
p78
aa(lp79
VIf you're going to do a study like that, you can imagine
p80
aVyou'd like to look at lots and lots of people.
p81
aVWe'd have to go and have a pretty wide study,
p82
aVand we realized that actually
p83
aVone way to think of this is,
p84
aVlet us look at adults who are over 40 years of age,
p85
aVand let's make sure that we look at those
p86
aVwho were healthy as kids.
p87
aVThey might have had individuals in their families
p88
aVwho had had a childhood disease,
p89
aVbut not necessarily.
p90
aVAnd let's go and then screen those
p91
aVto find those who are carrying genes
p92
aVfor childhood diseases.
p93
aa(lp94
VNow, some of you, I can see you
p95
aVputting your hands up going, "Uh, a little odd.
p96
aVWhat's your evidence
p97
aVthat this could be feasible?"
p98
aVI want to give you two examples.
p99
aa(lp100
VThe first comes from San Francisco.
p101
aVIt comes from the 1980s and the 1990s,
p102
aVand you may know the story where
p103
aVthere were individuals who had very high levels
p104
aVof the virus HIV.
p105
aVThey went on to get AIDS.
p106
aVBut there was a very small set of individuals
p107
aVwho also had very high levels of HIV.
p108
aVThey didn't get AIDS.
p109
aVAnd astute clinicians tracked that down,
p110
aVand what they found was they were carrying mutations.
p111
aVNotice, they were carrying mutations from birth
p112
aVthat were protective, that were protecting them
p113
aVfrom going on to get AIDS.
p114
aVYou may also know that actually a line of therapy
p115
aVhas been coming along based on that fact.
p116
aVSecond example, more recent, is elegant work
p117
aVdone by Helen Hobbs,
p118
aVwho said, "I'm going to look at individuals
p119
aVwho have very high lipid levels,
p120
aVand I'm going to try to find those people
p121
aVwith high lipid levels
p122
aVwho don't go on to get heart disease."
p123
aVAnd again, what she found was
p124
aVsome of those individuals had mutations
p125
aVthat were protective from birth that kept them,
p126
aVeven though they had high lipid levels,
p127
aVand you can see this is an interesting way
p128
aVof thinking about how you could develop
p129
aVpreventive therapies.
p130
aa(lp131
VThe project that we're working on
p132
aVis called "The Resilience Project:
p133
aVA Search for Unexpected Heroes,"
p134
aVbecause what we are interested in doing is saying,
p135
aVcan we find those rare individuals
p136
aVwho might have these hidden protective factors?
p137
aVAnd in some ways, think of it as a decoder ring,
p138
aVa sort of resilience decoder ring
p139
aVthat we're going to try to build.
p140
aVWe've realized that we should  do this in a systematic way,
p141
aVso we've said, let's take every single
p142
aVchildhood inherited disease.
p143
aVLet's take them all, and let's pull them back a little bit
p144
aVby those that are known to have severe symptoms,
p145
aVwhere the parents, the child,
p146
aVthose around them would know
p147
aVthat they'd gotten sick,
p148
aVand let's go ahead and then frame them again
p149
aVby those parts of the genes where we know
p150
aVthat there is a particular alteration
p151
aVthat is known to be highly penetrant
p152
aVto cause that disease.
p153
aa(lp154
VWhere are we going to look?
p155
aVWell, we could look locally. That makes sense.
p156
aVBut we began to think, maybe we should look
p157
aVall over the world.
p158
aVMaybe we should look not just here
p159
aVbut in remote places where their might be
p160
aVa distinct genetic context,
p161
aVthere might be environmental factors
p162
aVthat protect people.
p163
aVAnd let's look at a million individuals.
p164
aa(lp165
VNow the reason why we think it's a good time
p166
aVto do that now
p167
aVis, in the last couple of years,
p168
aVthere's been a remarkable plummeting in the cost
p169
aVto do this type of analysis,
p170
aVthis type of data generation,
p171
aVto where it actually costs less to do
p172
aVthe data generation and analysis
p173
aVthan it does to do the sample processing and the collection.
p174
aVThe other reason is that in the last five years,
p175
aVthere have been awesome tools,
p176
aVthings about network biology, systems biology,
p177
aVthat have come up that allow us to think
p178
aVthat maybe we could decipher
p179
aVthose positive outliers.
p180
aa(lp181
VAnd as we went around talking to researchers
p182
aVand institutions
p183
aVand telling them about our story,
p184
aVsomething happened.
p185
aVThey started saying, "This is interesting.
p186
aVI would be glad to join your effort.
p187
aVI would be willing to participate."
p188
aVAnd they didn't say, "Where's the MTA?"
p189
aVThey didn't say, "Where is my authorship?"
p190
aVThey didn't say, "Is this data going  to be mine? Am I going to own it?"
p191
aVThey basically said, "Let's work on this
p192
aVin an open, crowd-sourced, team way
p193
aVto do this decoding."
p194
aa(lp195
VSix months ago, we locked down
p196
aVthe screening key for this decoder.
p197
aVMy co-lead, a brilliant scientist, Eric Schadt
p198
aVat the Icahn Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York,
p199
aVand his team,
p200
aVlocked in that decoder key ring,
p201
aVand we began looking for samples,
p202
aVbecause what we realized is,
p203
aVmaybe we could just go and look
p204
aVat some existing samples to get some sense of feasibility.
p205
aVMaybe we could take two, three  percent of the project on,
p206
aVand see if it was there.
p207
aVAnd so we started asking people
p208
aVsuch as Hakon at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia.
p209
aVWe asked Leif up in Finland.
p210
aVWe talked to Anne Wojcicki at 23andMe,
p211
aVand Wang Jun at BGI,
p212
aVand again, something remarkable happened.
p213
aVThey said, "Huh,
p214
aVnot only do we have samples,
p215
aVbut often we've analyzed them,
p216
aVand we would be glad to go into
p217
aVour anonymized samples
p218
aVand see if we could find those
p219
aVthat you're looking for."
p220
aVAnd instead of being 20,000 or 30,000,
p221
aVlast month we passed one half million samples
p222
aVthat we've already analyzed.
p223
aa(lp224
VSo you must be going,
p225
aV"Huh, did you find any unexpected heroes?"
p226
aVAnd the answer is, we didn't find one or two.
p227
aVWe found dozens of these strong candidate
p228
aVunexpected heroes.
p229
aa(lp230
VSo we think that the time is now
p231
aVto launch the beta phase of this project
p232
aVand actually start getting prospective individuals.
p233
aVBasically all we need is information.
p234
aVWe need a swab of DNA
p235
aVand a willingness to say, "What's inside me?
p236
aVI'm willing to be re-contacted."
p237
aa(lp238
VMost of us spend our lives,
p239
aVwhen it comes to health and disease,
p240
aVacting as if we're voyeurs.
p241
aVWe delegate the responsibility
p242
aVfor the understanding of our disease,
p243
aVfor the treatment of our disease,
p244
aVto anointed experts.
p245
aVIn order for us to get this project to work,
p246
aVwe need individuals to step up
p247
aVin a different role and to be engaged,
p248
aVto realize this dream,
p249
aVthis open crowd-sourced project,
p250
aVto find those unexpected heroes,
p251
aVto evolve from the current concepts
p252
aVof resources and constraints,
p253
aVto design those preventive therapies,
p254
aVand to extend it beyond childhood diseases,
p255
aVto go all the way up to ways
p256
aVthat we could look at Alzheimer's or Parkinson's,
p257
aVwe're going to need us
p258
aVto be looking inside ourselves and asking,
p259
aV"What are our roles?
p260
aVWhat are our genes?"
p261
aVand looking within ourselves for information
p262
aVwe used to say we should go to the outside,
p263
aVto experts,
p264
aVand to be willing to share that with others.
p265
