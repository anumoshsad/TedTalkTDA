VHi. For those of you who haven't seen dancing bears,
p4
aVthese are the dancing bears.
p5
aVIn 1995, we started working on a two-year investigative research project
p6
aVto try and find out what was going on.
p7
aVBecause the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted
p8
aVbecause of this.
p9
aVThis is the Qalandar community. They are a marginalized Islamic community
p10
aVwho live across India,
p11
aVand have been in India since the 13th century.
p12
aa(lp13
VWe went about getting evidence of what was going on.
p14
aVAnd this is footage from a hidden camera in a button.
p15
aVAnd we went in, pretending to be buyers.
p16
aVAnd we found this right in this very state, in Karnataka.
p17
aVAnd the bear cubs were being harvested from across the country
p18
aVand being sold and traded.
p19
aVThese were being sold for about 2,000 dollars each,
p20
aVand they are used for bear paw soup,
p21
aVand also being trained, later on,
p22
aVto become dancing bears like the one you just saw.
p23
aa(lp24
VSadly, the family of Qalandars depended on this bear.
p25
aVThe couple are barely 18 years old.
p26
aVThey already have four children beside them. You can see them.
p27
aVAnd the economy of the family and their livelihood depended on those animals.
p28
aVSo, we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable manner.
p29
aa(lp30
VNow, when we started working deeper and digging deeper,
p31
aVwe found that it's an illegal act.
p32
aVThese guys could go to jail for up to seven years
p33
aVif they were caught by authorities.
p34
aVAnd what they were doing to the bears was really appalling.
p35
aVIt was unacceptable.
p36
aVThe mother bears are usually killed.
p37
aVThe cubs, which are taken, are separated.
p38
aVTheir teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod.
p39
aVAnd they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the muzzle.
p40
aVNow we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that
p41
aVfor a livelihood, to getting something else.
p42
aa(lp43
VSo, this is Bitu Qalandar, who was our first experiment.
p44
aVAnd we were so unsure that this would work.
p45
aVWe weren't sure at all. And we managed to convince him.
p46
aVAnd we said, "Okay, here is some seed fund.
p47
aVLet's see if you can get something else." And we got the bear surrendered
p48
aVto \u2014 we set up a sanctuary. We have four sanctuaries in India.
p49
aVAnd now he sells cool drinks, he's by the highway.
p50
aVHe has a telephone booth.
p51
aa(lp52
VAnd then it started, there was no turning back after that.
p53
aVThis is Sadua who came and surrendered his bear.
p54
aVAnd now he runs a cattle fodder store and a grain store
p55
aVnear Agra.
p56
aVThen there was no looking back at all for us.
p57
aVWe gave cycle rickshaws.
p58
aVWe set up carpet-weaving units,
p59
aVvocational training for the women.
p60
aVThe women were just not allowed to come out of the community
p61
aVand work with mainstream society. So, we were able to address that.
p62
aa(lp63
VEducation. The kids never went to school.
p64
aVThey only had Islamic education, very little of it.
p65
aVAnd they were never allowed to go to school
p66
aVbecause they were an extra earning hand at home. So we managed to get education.
p67
aVSo, we sponsor 600 children education programs today.
p68
aVWe were able to ensure brighter futures for these people.
p69
aa(lp70
VOf course we also had to get the bears in.
p71
aVThis is what happens to the bears when they come in.
p72
aVAnd this is what we turn them into.
p73
aVWe have a veterinary facility in our rescue centers.
p74
aVSo, basically in 2002 there were
p75
aV1,200 dancing bears.
p76
aVWe rescued over 550 dancing bears.
p77
aVWe've been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears.
p78
aa(lp79
VThe big news that I want to announce today
p80
aVis that next month we will be bringing in
p81
aVthe very last bear of India,
p82
aVinto our rescue center.
p83
aV(Applause)
p84
aVAnd India will no longer have to witness this cruel barbaric practice
p85
aVwhich has been here for centuries.
p86
aVAnd the people can hold their heads up high.
p87
aVAnd the Qalandar people will rise above all this cruel barbaric past
p88
aVthat they've lived all their lives.
p89
aVAnd the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again.
p90
aVAnd there will be no more removing of these bears.
p91
aVAnd the children, both humans and bear cubs
p92
aVcan live peacefully. Thank you.
