VOne year ago, I rented a car in Jerusalem
p4
aVto go find a man I'd never met
p5
aVbut who had changed my life.
p6
aVI didn't have a phone number to call to say I was coming.
p7
aVI didn't have an exact address,
p8
aVbut I knew his name, Abed,
p9
aVI knew that he lived in a town of 15,000, Kfar Kara,
p10
aVand I knew that, 21 years before, just outside this holy city,
p11
aVhe broke my neck.
p12
aVAnd so, on an overcast morning in January, I headed north
p13
aVoff in a silver Chevy to find a man and some peace.
p14
aa(lp15
VThe road dropped and I exited Jerusalem.
p16
aVI then rounded the very bend where his blue truck,
p17
aVheavy with four tons of floor tiles,
p18
aVhad borne down with great speed onto the back left corner
p19
aVof the minibus where I sat.
p20
aVI was then 19 years old.
p21
aVI'd grown five inches and done some 20,000 pushups
p22
aVin eight months, and the night before the crash,
p23
aVI delighted in my new body,
p24
aVplaying basketball with friends
p25
aVinto the wee hours of a May morning.
p26
aVI palmed the ball in my large right hand,
p27
aVand when that hand reached the rim, I felt invincible.
p28
aVI was off in the bus to get the pizza I'd won on the court.
p29
aa(lp30
VI didn't see Abed coming.
p31
aVFrom my seat, I was looking up at a stone town
p32
aVon a hilltop, bright in the noontime sun,
p33
aVwhen from behind there was a great bang,
p34
aVas loud and violent as a bomb.
p35
aVMy head snapped back over my red seat.
p36
aVMy eardrum blew. My shoes flew off.
p37
aVI flew too, my head bobbing on broken bones,
p38
aVand when I landed, I was a quadriplegic.
p39
aVOver the coming months, I learned to breathe on my own,
p40
aVthen to sit and to stand and to walk,
p41
aVbut my body was now divided vertically.
p42
aVI was a hemiplegic, and back home in New York,
p43
aVI used a wheelchair for four years, all through college.
p44
aa(lp45
VCollege ended and I returned to Jerusalem for a year.
p46
aVThere I rose from my chair for good,
p47
aVI leaned on my cane, and I looked back,
p48
aVfinding all from my fellow passengers in the bus
p49
aVto photographs of the crash,
p50
aVand when I saw this photograph,
p51
aVI didn't see a bloody and unmoving body.
p52
aVI saw the healthy bulk of a left deltoid,
p53
aVand I mourned that it was lost,
p54
aVmourned all I had not yet done,
p55
aVbut was now impossible.
p56
aa(lp57
VIt was then I read the testimony that Abed gave
p58
aVthe morning after the crash,
p59
aVof driving down the right lane of a highway toward Jerusalem.
p60
aVReading his words, I welled with anger.
p61
aVIt was the first time I'd felt anger toward this man,
p62
aVand it came from magical thinking.
p63
aVOn this xeroxed piece of paper,
p64
aVthe crash had not yet happened.
p65
aVAbed could still turn his wheel left
p66
aVso that I would see him whoosh by out my window
p67
aVand I would remain whole.
p68
aV"Be careful, Abed, look out. Slow down."
p69
aVBut Abed did not slow,
p70
aVand on that xeroxed piece of paper, my neck again broke,
p71
aVand again, I was left without anger.
p72
aa(lp73
VI decided to find Abed,
p74
aVand when I finally did,
p75
aVhe responded to my Hebrew hello which such nonchalance,
p76
aVit seemed he'd been awaiting my phone call.
p77
aVAnd maybe he had.
p78
aVI didn't mention to Abed his prior driving record \u2014
p79
aV27 violations by the age of 25,
p80
aVthe last, his not shifting his truck into a low gear on that May day \u2014
p81
aVand I didn't mention my prior record \u2014
p82
aVthe quadriplegia and the catheters,
p83
aVthe insecurity and the loss \u2014
p84
aVand when Abed went on about how hurt he was in the crash,
p85
aVI didn't say that I knew from the police report
p86
aVthat he'd escaped serious injury.
p87
aVI said I wanted to meet.
p88
aVAbed said that I should call back in a few weeks,
p89
aVand when I did, and a recording told me
p90
aVthat his number was disconnected,
p91
aVI let Abed and the crash go.
p92
aa(lp93
VMany years passed.
p94
aVI walked with my cane and my ankle brace and a backpack
p95
aVon trips in six continents.
p96
aVI pitched overhand in a weekly softball game
p97
aVthat I started in Central Park,
p98
aVand home in New York, I became a journalist and an author,
p99
aVtyping hundreds of thousands of words with one finger.
p100
aVA friend pointed out to me that all of my big stories
p101
aVmirrored my own, each centering on a life
p102
aVthat had changed in an instant,
p103
aVowing, if not to a crash, then to an inheritance,
p104
aVa swing of the bat, a click of the shutter, an arrest.
p105
aVEach of us had a before and an after.
p106
aVI'd been working through my lot after all.
p107
aa(lp108
VStill, Abed was far from my mind, when last year,
p109
aVI returned to Israel to write of the crash,
p110
aVand the book I then wrote, "Half-Life,"
p111
aVwas nearly complete when I recognized
p112
aVthat I still wanted to meet Abed,
p113
aVand finally I understood why:
p114
aVto hear this man say two words: "I'm sorry."
p115
aVPeople apologize for less.
p116
aVAnd so I got a cop to confirm that Abed still lived
p117
aVsomewhere in his same town,
p118
aVand I was now driving to it with a potted yellow rose in the back seat,
p119
aVwhen suddenly flowers seemed a ridiculous offering.
p120
aVBut what to get the man who broke your fucking neck?
p121
aV(Laughter)
p122
aVI pulled into the town of Abu Ghosh,
p123
aVand bought a brick of Turkish delight:
p124
aVpistachios glued in rosewater. Better.
p125
aa(lp126
VBack on Highway 1, I envisioned what awaited.
p127
aVAbed would hug me. Abed would spit at me.
p128
aVAbed would say, "I'm sorry."
p129
aVI then began to wonder, as I had many times before,
p130
aVhow my life would have been different
p131
aVhad this man not injured me,
p132
aVhad my genes been fed a different helping of experience.
p133
aVWho was I?
p134
aVWas I who I had been before the crash,
p135
aVbefore this road divided my life like the spine of an open book?
p136
aVWas I what had been done to me?
p137
aVWere all of us the results of things done to us, done for us,
p138
aVthe infidelity of a parent or spouse,
p139
aVmoney inherited?
p140
aVWere we instead our bodies, their inborn endowments and deficits?
p141
aVIt seemed that we could be nothing more than genes and experience,
p142
aVbut how to tease out the one from the other?
p143
aVAs Yeats put that same universal question,
p144
aV"O body swayed to music, o brightening glance,
p145
aVhow can we know the dancer from the dance?"
p146
aVI'd been driving for an hour
p147
aVwhen I looked in my rearview mirror and saw my own brightening glance.
p148
aVThe light my eyes had carried for as long as they had been blue.
p149
aVThe predispositions and impulses that had propelled me
p150
aVas a toddler to try and slip over a boat into a Chicago lake,
p151
aVthat had propelled me as a teen
p152
aVto jump into wild Cape Cod Bay after a hurricane.
p153
aVBut I also saw in my reflection
p154
aVthat, had Abed not injured me,
p155
aVI would now, in all likelihood, be a doctor
p156
aVand a husband and a father.
p157
aVI would be less mindful of time and of death,
p158
aVand, oh, I would not be disabled,
p159
aVwould not suffer the thousand slings and arrows of my fortune.
p160
aVThe frequent furl of five fingers, the chips in my teeth
p161
aVcome from biting at all the many things
p162
aVa solitary hand cannot open.
p163
aVThe dancer and the dance were hopelessly entwined.
p164
aa(lp165
VIt was approaching 11 when I exited right
p166
aVtoward Afula, and passed a large quarry
p167
aVand was soon in Kfar Kara.
p168
aVI felt a pang of nerves.
p169
aVBut Chopin was on the radio, seven beautiful mazurkas,
p170
aVand I pulled into a lot by a gas station
p171
aVto listen and to calm.
p172
aa(lp173
VI'd been told that in an Arab town,
p174
aVone need only mention the name of a local
p175
aVand it will be recognized.
p176
aVAnd I was mentioning Abed and myself,
p177
aVnoting deliberately that I was here in peace,
p178
aVto the people in this town,
p179
aVwhen I met Mohamed outside a post office at noon.
p180
aVHe listened to me.
p181
aa(lp182
VYou know, it was most often when speaking to people
p183
aVthat I wondered where I ended and my disability began,
p184
aVfor many people told me what they told no one else.
p185
aVMany cried.
p186
aVAnd one day, after a woman I met on the street did the same
p187
aVand I later asked her why,
p188
aVshe told me that, best she could tell, her tears
p189
aVhad had something to do with my being happy and strong,
p190
aVbut vulnerable too.
p191
aVI listened to her words. I suppose they were true.
p192
aVI was me,
p193
aVbut I was now me despite a limp,
p194
aVand that, I suppose, was what now made me, me.
p195
aa(lp196
VAnyway, Mohamed told me
p197
aVwhat perhaps he would not have told another stranger.
p198
aVHe led me to a house of cream stucco, then drove off.
p199
aVAnd as I sat contemplating what to say,
p200
aVa woman approached in a black shawl and black robe.
p201
aVI stepped from my car and said "Shalom,"
p202
aVand identified myself,
p203
aVand she told me that her husband Abed
p204
aVwould be home from work in four hours.
p205
aVHer Hebrew was not good, and she later confessed
p206
aVthat she thought that I had come to install the Internet.
p207
aV(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
VI drove off and returned at 4:30,
p210
aVthankful to the minaret up the road
p211
aVthat helped me find my way back.
p212
aVAnd as I approached the front door,
p213
aVAbed saw me, my jeans and flannel and cane,
p214
aVand I saw Abed, an average-looking man of average size.
p215
aVHe wore black and white: slippers over socks,
p216
aVpilling sweatpants, a piebald sweater,
p217
aVa striped ski cap pulled down to his forehead.
p218
aVHe'd been expecting me. Mohamed had phoned.
p219
aVAnd so at once, we shook hands, and smiled,
p220
aVand I gave him my gift,
p221
aVand he told me I was a guest in his home,
p222
aVand we sat beside one another on a fabric couch.
p223
aa(lp224
VIt was then that Abed resumed at once
p225
aVthe tale of woe he had begun over the phone
p226
aV16 years before.
p227
aVHe'd just had surgery on his eyes, he said.
p228
aVHe had problems with his side and his legs too,
p229
aVand, oh, he'd lost his teeth in the crash.
p230
aVDid I wish to see him remove them?
p231
aVAbed then rose and turned on the TV
p232
aVso that I wouldn't be alone when he left the room,
p233
aVand returned with polaroids of the crash
p234
aVand his old driver's license.
p235
aa(lp236
V"I was handsome," he said.
p237
aa(lp238
VWe looked down at his laminated mug.
p239
aVAbed had been less handsome than substantial,
p240
aVwith thick black hair and a full face and a wide neck.
p241
aVIt was this youth who on May 16, 1990,
p242
aVhad broken two necks including mine,
p243
aVand bruised one brain and taken one life.
p244
aVTwenty-one years later, he was now thinner than his wife,
p245
aVhis skin slack on his face,
p246
aVand looking at Abed looking at his young self,
p247
aVI remembered looking at that photograph of my young self
p248
aVafter the crash, and recognized his longing.
p249
aa(lp250
V"The crash changed both of our lives," I said.
p251
aa(lp252
VAbed then showed me a picture of his mashed truck,
p253
aVand said that the crash was the fault of a bus driver
p254
aVin the left lane who did not let him pass.
p255
aVI did not want to recap the crash with Abed.
p256
aVI'd hoped for something simpler:
p257
aVto exchange a Turkish dessert for two words and be on my way.
p258
aVAnd so I didn't point out that in his own testimony
p259
aVthe morning after the crash,
p260
aVAbed did not even mention the bus driver.
p261
aVNo, I was quiet. I was quiet because I had not come for truth.
p262
aVI had come for remorse.
p263
aVAnd so I now went looking for remorse
p264
aVand threw truth under the bus.
p265
aa(lp266
V"I understand," I said, "that the crash was not your fault,
p267
aVbut does it make you sad that others suffered?"
p268
aa(lp269
VAbed spoke three quick words.
p270
aV"Yes, I suffered."
p271
aa(lp272
VAbed then told me why he'd suffered.
p273
aVHe'd lived an unholy life before the crash,
p274
aVand so God had ordained the crash,
p275
aVbut now, he said, he was religious, and God was pleased.
p276
aa(lp277
VIt was then that God intervened:
p278
aVnews on the TV of a car wreck that hours before
p279
aVhad killed three people up north.
p280
aVWe looked up at the wreckage.
p281
aa(lp282
V"Strange," I said.
p283
aa(lp284
V"Strange," he agreed.
p285
aa(lp286
VI had the thought that there, on Route 804,
p287
aVthere were perpetrators and victims,
p288
aVdyads bound by a crash.
p289
aVSome, as had Abed, would forget the date.
p290
aVSome, as had I, would remember.
p291
aVThe report finished and Abed spoke.
p292
aa(lp293
V"It is a pity," he said, "that the police
p294
aVin this country are not tough enough on bad drivers."
p295
aa(lp296
VI was baffled.
p297
aVAbed had said something remarkable.
p298
aVDid it point up the degree to which he'd absolved himself of the crash?
p299
aVWas it evidence of guilt, an assertion
p300
aVthat he should have been put away longer?
p301
aVHe'd served six months in prison, lost his truck license for a decade.
p302
aVI forgot my discretion.
p303
aa(lp304
V"Um, Abed," I said,
p305
aV"I thought you had a few driving issues before the crash."
p306
aa(lp307
V"Well," he said, "I once went 60 in a 40."
p308
aVAnd so 27 violations \u2014
p309
aVdriving through a red light, driving at excessive speed,
p310
aVdriving on the wrong side of a barrier,
p311
aVand finally, riding his brakes down that hill \u2014
p312
aVreduced to one.
p313
aa(lp314
VAnd it was then I understood that no matter how stark the reality,
p315
aVthe human being fits it into a narrative that is palatable.
p316
aVThe goat becomes the hero. The perpetrator becomes the victim.
p317
aVIt was then I understood that Abed would never apologize.
p318
aa(lp319
VAbed and I sat with our coffee.
p320
aVWe'd spent 90 minutes together,
p321
aVand he was now known to me.
p322
aVHe was not a particularly bad man
p323
aVor a particularly good man.
p324
aVHe was a limited man
p325
aVwho'd found it within himself to be kind to me.
p326
aVWith a nod to Jewish custom,
p327
aVhe told me that I should live to be 120 years old.
p328
aVBut it was hard for me to relate to one who had
p329
aVso completely washed his hands of his own calamitous doing,
p330
aVto one whose life was so unexamined that he said
p331
aVhe thought two people had died in the crash.
p332
aa(lp333
VThere was much I wished to say to Abed.
p334
aVI wished to tell him that, were he to acknowledge my disability,
p335
aVit would be okay,
p336
aVfor people are wrong to marvel
p337
aVat those like me who smile as we limp.
p338
aVPeople don't know that they have lived through worse,
p339
aVthat problems of the heart hit with a force greater than a runaway truck,
p340
aVthat problems of the mind are greater still,
p341
aVmore injurious, than a hundred broken necks.
p342
aVI wished to tell him that what makes most of us who we are
p343
aVmost of all
p344
aVis not our minds and not our bodies
p345
aVand not what happens to us,
p346
aVbut how we respond to what happens to us.
p347
aV"This," wrote the psychiatrist Viktor Frankl,
p348
aV"is the last of the human freedoms:
p349
aVto choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances."
p350
aVI wished to tell him that not only paralyzers
p351
aVand paralyzees must evolve, reconcile to reality,
p352
aVbut we all must \u2014
p353
aVthe aging and the anxious and the divorced and the balding
p354
aVand the bankrupt and everyone.
p355
aVI wished to tell him that one does not have to say
p356
aVthat a bad thing is good,
p357
aVthat a crash is from God and so a crash is good,
p358
aVa broken neck is good.
p359
aVOne can say that a bad thing sucks,
p360
aVbut that this natural world still has many glories.
p361
aVI wished to tell him that, in the end, our mandate is clear:
p362
aVWe have to rise above bad fortune.
p363
aVWe have to be in the good and enjoy the good,
p364
aVstudy and work and adventure and friendship \u2014 oh, friendship \u2014
p365
aVand community and love.
p366
aa(lp367
VBut most of all, I wished to tell him
p368
aVwhat Herman Melville wrote,
p369
aVthat "truly to enjoy bodily warmth,
p370
aVsome small part of you must be cold,
p371
aVfor there is no quality in this world
p372
aVthat is not what it is merely by contrast."
p373
aVYes, contrast.
p374
aVIf you are mindful of what you do not have,
p375
aVyou may be truly mindful of what you do have,
p376
aVand if the gods are kind, you may truly enjoy what you have.
p377
aVThat is the one singular gift you may receive
p378
aVif you suffer in any existential way.
p379
aVYou know death, and so may wake each morning
p380
aVpulsing with ready life.
p381
aVSome part of you is cold,
p382
aVand so another part may truly enjoy what it is to be warm,
p383
aVor even to be cold.
p384
aVWhen one morning, years after the crash,
p385
aVI stepped onto stone and the underside of my left foot
p386
aVfelt the flash of cold, nerves at last awake,
p387
aVit was exhilarating, a gust of snow.
p388
aa(lp389
VBut I didn't say these things to Abed.
p390
aVI told him only that he had killed one man, not two.
p391
aVI told him the name of that man.
p392
aVAnd then I said, "Goodbye."
p393
aa(lp394
VThank you.
p395
aa(lp396
V(Applause)
p397
aVThanks a lot.
