VWhat was the most difficult job you ever did?
p4
aVWas it working in the sun?
p5
aVWas it working to provide food for a family or a community?
p6
aVWas it working days and nights trying to protect lives and property?
p7
aVWas it working alone
p8
aVor working on a project that wasn't guaranteed to succeed,
p9
aVbut that might improve human health or save a life?
p10
aVWas it working to build something, create something, make a work of art?
p11
aVWas it work for which you were never sure
p12
aVyou were fully understood or appreciated?
p13
aVThe people in our communities who do these jobs
p14
aVdeserve our attention, our love and our deepest support.
p15
aa(lp16
VBut people aren't the only ones in our communities
p17
aVwho do these difficult jobs.
p18
aVThese jobs are also done by the plants, the animals
p19
aVand the ecosystems on our planet,
p20
aVincluding the ecosystems I study: the tropical coral reefs.
p21
aVCoral reefs are farmers.
p22
aVThey provide food, income and food security
p23
aVfor hundreds of millions of people around the world.
p24
aVCoral reefs are security guards.
p25
aVThe structures that they build protect our shorelines
p26
aVfrom storm surge and waves,
p27
aVand the biological systems that they house filter the water
p28
aVand make it safer for us to work and play.
p29
aVCoral reefs are chemists.
p30
aVThe molecules that we're discovering on coral reefs are increasingly important
p31
aVin the search for new antibiotics and new cancer drugs.
p32
aVAnd coral reefs are artists.
p33
aVThe structures that they build
p34
aVare some of the most beautiful things on planet Earth.
p35
aVAnd this beauty is the foundation of the tourism industry
p36
aVin many countries with few or little other natural resources.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo for all of these reasons, all of these ecosystem services,
p39
aVeconomists estimate the value of the world's coral reefs
p40
aVin the hundreds of billions of dollars per year.
p41
aVAnd yet despite all that hard work being done for us
p42
aVand all that wealth that we gain,
p43
aVwe have done almost everything we possibly could to destroy that.
p44
aVWe have taken the fish out of the oceans
p45
aVand we have added in fertilizer, sewage,
p46
aVdiseases, oil, pollution, sediments.
p47
aVWe have trampled the reefs physically with our boats, our fins, our bulldozers,
p48
aVand we have changed the chemistry of the entire sea,
p49
aVwarmed the waters and made storms worse.
p50
aVAnd these would all be bad on their own,
p51
aVbut these threats magnify each other
p52
aVand compound one another and make each other worse.
p53
aa(lp54
VI'll give you an example.
p55
aVWhere I live and work, in Curaçao, a tropical storm went by a few years ago.
p56
aVAnd on the eastern end of the island,
p57
aVwhere the reefs are intact and thriving,
p58
aVyou could barely tell a tropical storm had passed.
p59
aVBut in town, where corals had died from overfishing, from pollution,
p60
aVthe tropical storm picked up the dead corals
p61
aVand used them as bludgeons to kill the corals that were left.
p62
aVThis is a coral that I studied during my PhD \u2014
p63
aVI got to know it quite well.
p64
aVAnd after this storm took off half of its tissue,
p65
aVit became infested with algae,
p66
aVthe algae overgrew the tissue and that coral died.
p67
aVThis magnification of threats, this compounding of factors
p68
aVis what Jeremy Jackson describes as the "slippery slope to slime."
p69
aVIt's hardly even a metaphor because many of our reefs now
p70
aVare literally bacteria and algae and slime.
p71
aa(lp72
VNow, this is the part of the talk
p73
aVwhere you may expect me to launch into my plea
p74
aVfor us to all save the coral reefs.
p75
aVBut I have a confession to make:
p76
aVthat phrase drives me nuts.
p77
aVWhether I see it in a tweet, in a news headline
p78
aVor the glossy pages of a conservation brochure,
p79
aVthat phrase bothers me,
p80
aVbecause we as conservationists have been sounding the alarms
p81
aVabout the death of coral reefs for decades.
p82
aVAnd yet, almost everyone I meet, no matter how educated,
p83
aVis not sure what a coral is or where they come from.
p84
aVHow would we get someone to care about the world's coral reefs
p85
aVwhen it's an abstract thing they can barely understand?
p86
aVIf they don't understand what a coral is or where it comes from,
p87
aVor how funny or interesting or beautiful it is,
p88
aVwhy would we expect them to care about saving them?
p89
aa(lp90
VSo let's change that.
p91
aVWhat is a coral and where does it come from?
p92
aVCorals are born in a number of different ways,
p93
aVbut most often by mass spawning: all of the individuals of a single species
p94
aVon one night a year,
p95
aVreleasing all the eggs they've made that year
p96
aVinto the water column,
p97
aVpackaged into bundles with sperm cells.
p98
aVAnd those bundles go to the surface of the ocean and break apart.
p99
aVAnd hopefully \u2014 hopefully \u2014 at the surface of the ocean,
p100
aVthey meet the eggs and sperm from other corals.
p101
aVAnd that is why you need lots of corals on a coral reef \u2014
p102
aVso that all of their eggs can meet their match at the surface.
p103
aVWhen they're fertilized, they do what any other animal egg does:
p104
aVdivides in half again and again and again.
p105
aVTaking these photos under the microscope every year
p106
aVis one of my favorite and most magical moments of the year.
p107
aVAt the end of all this cell division, they turn into a swimming larva \u2014
p108
aVa little tiny blob of fat the size of a poppy seed,
p109
aVbut with all of the sensory systems that we have.
p110
aVThey can sense color and light, textures, chemicals, pH.
p111
aVThey can even feel pressure waves; they can hear sound.
p112
aVAnd they use those talents
p113
aVto search the bottom of the reef for a place to attach
p114
aVand live the rest of their lives.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo imagine finding a place where you would live the rest of your life
p117
aVwhen you were just two days old.
p118
aVThey attach in the place they find most suitable,
p119
aVthey build a skeleton underneath themselves,
p120
aVthey build a mouth and tentacles,
p121
aVand then they begin the difficult work of building the world's coral reefs.
p122
aVOne coral polyp will divide itself again and again and again,
p123
aVleaving a limestone skeleton underneath itself
p124
aVand growing up toward the sun.
p125
aVGiven hundreds of years and many species,
p126
aVwhat you get is a massive limestone structure
p127
aVthat can be seen from space in many cases,
p128
aVcovered by a thin skin of these hardworking animals.
p129
aVNow, there are only a few hundred species of corals on the planet, maybe 1,000.
p130
aVBut these systems house millions and millions of other species,
p131
aVand that diversity is what stabilizes the systems,
p132
aVand it's where we're finding our new medicines.
p133
aVIt's how we find new sources of food.
p134
aVI'm lucky enough to work on the island of Curaçao,
p135
aVwhere we still have reefs that look like this.
p136
aVBut, indeed, much of the Caribbean and much of our world
p137
aVis much more like this.
p138
aa(lp139
VScientists have studied in increasing detail
p140
aVthe loss of the world's coral reefs,
p141
aVand they have documented with increasing certainty the causes.
p142
aVBut in my research, I'm not interested in looking backward.
p143
aVMy colleagues and I in Curaçao are interested in looking forward
p144
aVat what might be.
p145
aVAnd we have the tiniest reason to be optimistic.
p146
aVBecause even in some of these reefs
p147
aVthat we probably could have written off long ago,
p148
aVwe sometimes see baby corals arrive and survive anyway.
p149
aVAnd we're starting to think that baby corals may have the ability
p150
aVto adjust to some of the conditions that the adults couldn't.
p151
aVThey may be able to adjust
p152
aVever so slightly more readily to this human planet.
p153
aVSo in the research I do with my colleagues in Curaçao,
p154
aVwe try to figure out what a baby coral needs
p155
aVin that critical early stage,
p156
aVwhat it's looking for
p157
aVand how we can try to help it through that process.
p158
aVI'm going to show you three examples of the work we've done
p159
aVto try to answer those questions.
p160
aa(lp161
VA few years ago we took a 3D printer and we made coral choice surveys \u2014
p162
aVdifferent colors and different textures,
p163
aVand we simply asked the coral where they preferred to settle.
p164
aVAnd we found that corals, even without the biology involved,
p165
aVstill prefer white and pink, the colors of a healthy reef.
p166
aVAnd they prefer crevices and grooves and holes,
p167
aVwhere they will be safe from being trampled
p168
aVor eaten by a predator.
p169
aVSo we can use this knowledge,
p170
aVwe can go back and say we need to restore those factors \u2014
p171
aVthat pink, that white, those crevices, those hard surfaces \u2014
p172
aVin our conservation projects.
p173
aVWe can also use that knowledge
p174
aVif we're going to put something underwater, like a sea wall or a pier.
p175
aVWe can choose to use the materials and colors and textures
p176
aVthat might bias the system back toward those corals.
p177
aVNow in addition to the surfaces,
p178
aVwe also study the chemical and microbial signals
p179
aVthat attract corals to reefs.
p180
aVStarting about six years ago, I began culturing bacteria
p181
aVfrom surfaces where corals had settled.
p182
aVAnd I tried those one by one by one,
p183
aVlooking for the bacteria that would convince corals to settle and attach.
p184
aVAnd we now have many bacterial strains in our freezer
p185
aVthat will reliably cause corals
p186
aVto go through that settlement and attachment process.
p187
aVSo as we speak,
p188
aVmy colleagues in Curaçao are testing those bacteria
p189
aVto see if they'll help us raise more coral settlers in the lab,
p190
aVand to see if those coral settlers will survive better
p191
aVwhen we put them back underwater.
p192
aa(lp193
VNow in addition to these tools, we also try to uncover the mysteries
p194
aVof species that are under-studied.
p195
aVThis is one of my favorite corals, and always has been:
p196
aVdendrogyra cylindrus, the pillar coral.
p197
aVI love it because it makes this ridiculous shape,
p198
aVbecause its tentacles are fat and look fuzzy
p199
aVand because it's rare.
p200
aVFinding one of these on a reef is a treat.
p201
aVIn fact, it's so rare,
p202
aVthat last year it was listed as a threatened species
p203
aVon the endangered species list.
p204
aVAnd this was in part because in over 30 years of research surveys,
p205
aVscientists had never found a baby pillar coral.
p206
aVWe weren't even sure if they could still reproduce,
p207
aVor if they were still reproducing.
p208
aa(lp209
VSo four years ago, we started following these at night
p210
aVand watching to see if we could figure out when they spawn in Curaçao.
p211
aVWe got some good tips from our colleagues in Florida,
p212
aVwho had seen one in 2007, one in 2008,
p213
aVand eventually we figured out when they spawn in Curaçao
p214
aVand we caught it.
p215
aVHere's a female on the left with some eggs in her tissue,
p216
aVabout to release them into the seawater.
p217
aVAnd here's a male on the right, releasing sperm.
p218
aVWe collected this, we got it back to the lab, we got it to fertilize
p219
aVand we got baby pillar corals swimming in our lab.
p220
aVThanks to the work of our scientific aunts and uncles,
p221
aVand thanks to the 10 years of practice we've had in Curaçao
p222
aVat raising other coral species,
p223
aVwe got some of those larvae to go through the rest of the process
p224
aVand settle and attach,
p225
aVand turn into metamorphosed corals.
p226
aVSo this is the first pillar coral baby that anyone ever saw.
p227
aa(lp228
V(Applause)
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd I have to say \u2014 if you think baby pandas are cute,
p231
aVthis is cuter.
p232
aa(lp233
V(Laughter)
p234
aa(lp235
VSo we're starting to figure out the secrets to this process,
p236
aVthe secrets of coral reproduction and how we might help them.
p237
aVAnd this is true all around the world;
p238
aVscientists are figuring out new ways to handle their embryos,
p239
aVto get them to settle,
p240
aVmaybe even figuring out the methods to preserve them at low temperatures,
p241
aVso that we can preserve their genetic diversity
p242
aVand work with them more often.
p243
aVBut this is still so low-tech.
p244
aVWe are limited by the space on our bench, the number of hands in the lab
p245
aVand the number of coffees we can drink in any given hour.
p246
aa(lp247
VNow, compare that to our other crises
p248
aVand our other areas of concern as a society.
p249
aVWe have advanced medical technology, we have defense technology,
p250
aVwe have scientific technology,
p251
aVwe even have advanced technology for art.
p252
aVBut our technology for conservation is behind.
p253
aVThink back to the most difficult job you ever did.
p254
aVMany of you would say it was being a parent.
p255
aVMy mother described being a parent
p256
aVas something that makes your life far more amazing and far more difficult
p257
aVthan you could've ever possibly imagined.
p258
aVI've been trying to help corals become parents for over 10 years now.
p259
aVAnd watching the wonder of life
p260
aVhas certainly filled me with amazement to the core of my soul.
p261
aVBut I've also seen how difficult it is for them to become parents.
p262
aVThe pillar corals spawned again two weeks ago,
p263
aVand we collected their eggs and brought them back to the lab.
p264
aVAnd here you see one embryo dividing,
p265
aValongside 14 eggs that didn't fertilize
p266
aVand will blow up.
p267
aVThey'll be infected with bacteria, they will explode
p268
aVand those bacteria will threaten the life of this one embryo
p269
aVthat has a chance.
p270
aVWe don't know if it was our handling methods that went wrong
p271
aVand we don't know
p272
aVif it was just this coral on this reef, always suffering from low fertility.
p273
aVWhatever the cause,
p274
aVwe have much more work to do before we can use baby corals
p275
aVto grow or fix or, yes, maybe save coral reefs.
p276
aa(lp277
VSo never mind that they're worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
p278
aVCoral reefs are hardworking animals and plants and microbes and fungi.
p279
aVThey're providing us with art and food and medicine.
p280
aVAnd we almost took out an entire generation of corals.
p281
aVBut a few made it anyway, despite our best efforts,
p282
aVand now it's time for us to thank them for the work they did
p283
aVand give them every chance they have to raise the coral reefs of the future,
p284
aVtheir coral babies.
p285
aa(lp286
VThank you so much.
