VSo, I'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today
p4
aVimagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years.
p5
aVBut before I do that,
p6
aVI need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics,
p7
aVwhich require huge amounts of energy to create
p8
aVand, because of their disposal issues,
p9
aVare slowly poisoning our planet.
p10
aVI also want to tell you and share with you
p11
aVhow my team and I
p12
aVhave been using mushrooms over the last three years.
p13
aVNot like that. (Laughter)
p14
aVWe're using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials,
p15
aVwhich perform a lot like plastics during their use,
p16
aVbut are made from crop waste
p17
aVand are totally compostable at the end of their lives.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Cheering)
p20
aa(lp21
VBut first,
p22
aVI need to talk to you about what I consider one of the most egregious offenders
p23
aVin the disposable plastics category.
p24
aVThis is a material you all know is Styrofoam,
p25
aVbut I like to think of it as toxic white stuff.
p26
aVIn a single cubic foot of this material \u2014
p27
aVabout what would come around your computer or large television \u2014
p28
aVyou have the same energy content
p29
aVof about a liter and a half of petrol.
p30
aVYet, after just a few weeks of use,
p31
aVyou'll throw this material in the trash.
p32
aVAnd this isn't just found in packaging.
p33
aV20 billion dollars of this material is produced every year,
p34
aVin everything from building materials to surfboards
p35
aVto coffee cups to table tops.
p36
aVAnd that's not the only place it's found.
p37
aVThe EPA estimates, in the United States,
p38
aVby volume, this material occupies 25 percent of our landfills.
p39
aVEven worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment \u2014
p40
aVon the side of the road or next to a river.
p41
aVIf it's not picked up by a human, like me and you,
p42
aVit'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years.
p43
aVPerhaps even worse
p44
aVis when it finds its way into our oceans, like in the great plastic gyre,
p45
aVwhere these materials are being mechanically broken
p46
aVinto smaller and smaller bits,
p47
aVbut they're not really going away.
p48
aVThey're not biologically compatible.
p49
aVThey're basically fouling up
p50
aVEarth's respiratory and circulatory systems.
p51
aVAnd because these materials are so prolific,
p52
aVbecause they're found in so many places,
p53
aVthere's one other place you'll find this material, styrene,
p54
aVwhich is made from benzene, a known carcinogen.
p55
aVYou'll find it inside of you.
p56
aa(lp57
VSo, for all these reasons,
p58
aVI think we need better materials,
p59
aVand there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials.
p60
aVThe first is feedstocks.
p61
aVToday, we use a single feedstock, petroleum,
p62
aVto heat our homes, power our cars
p63
aVand make most of the materials you see around you.
p64
aVWe recognize this is a finite resource,
p65
aVand it's simply crazy to do this, to put a liter and a half of petrol in the trash
p66
aVevery time you get a package.
p67
aVSecond of all, we should really strive to use far less energy
p68
aVin creating these materials.
p69
aVI say far less, because 10 percent isn't going to cut it.
p70
aVWe should be talking about half, a quarter,
p71
aVone-tenth the energy content.
p72
aVAnd lastly, and I think perhaps most importantly,
p73
aVwe should be creating materials
p74
aVthat fit into what I call nature's recycling system.
p75
aVThis recycling system has been in place for the last billion years.
p76
aVI fit into it, you fit into it,
p77
aVand a hundred years tops, my body can return to the Earth with no preprocessing.
p78
aVYet that packaging I got in the mail yesterday
p79
aVis going to last for thousands of years.
p80
aVThis is crazy.
p81
aa(lp82
VBut nature provides us with a really good model here.
p83
aVWhen a tree's done using its leaves \u2014
p84
aVits solar collectors, these amazing molecular photon capturing devices \u2014
p85
aVat the end of a season,
p86
aVit doesn't pack them up, take them to the leaf reprocessing center
p87
aVand have them melted down to form new leaves.
p88
aVIt just drops them, the shortest distance possible,
p89
aVto the forest floor,
p90
aVwhere they're actually upcycled into next year's topsoil.
p91
aVAnd this gets us back to the mushrooms.
p92
aVBecause in nature,
p93
aVmushrooms are the recycling system.
p94
aVAnd what we've discovered
p95
aVis, by using a part of the mushroom you've probably never seen \u2014
p96
aVanalogous to its root structure; it's called mycelium \u2014
p97
aVwe can actually grow materials
p98
aVwith many of the same properties of conventional synthetics.
p99
aa(lp100
VNow, mycelium is an amazing material,
p101
aVbecause it's a self-assembling material.
p102
aVIt actually takes things we would consider waste \u2014
p103
aVthings like seed husks or woody biomass \u2014
p104
aVand can transform them into a chitinous polymer,
p105
aVwhich you can form into almost any shape.
p106
aVIn our process,
p107
aVwe basically use it as a glue.
p108
aVAnd by using mycelium as a glue,
p109
aVyou can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry,
p110
aVand you can create materials with many different properties,
p111
aVmaterials that are insulating, fire-resistant,
p112
aVmoisture-resistant, vapor-resistant \u2014
p113
aVmaterials that can absorb impacts, that can absorb acoustical impacts.
p114
aVBut these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts,
p115
aVnot petroleum.
p116
aVAnd because they're made of natural materials,
p117
aVthey are 100 percent compostable
p118
aVin you own backyard.
p119
aa(lp120
VSo I'd like to share with you the four basic steps
p121
aVrequired to make these materials.
p122
aVThe first is selecting a feedstock,
p123
aVpreferably something that's regional, that's in your area, right \u2014
p124
aVlocal manufacturing.
p125
aVThe next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool,
p126
aVphysically filling an enclosure, a mold,
p127
aVin whatever shape you want to get.
p128
aVThen you actually grow the mycelium through these particles,
p129
aVand that's where the magic happens,
p130
aVbecause the organism is doing the work in this process,
p131
aVnot the equipment.
p132
aVThe final step is, of course, the product,
p133
aVwhether it's a packaging material, a table top, or building block.
p134
aVOur vision is local manufacturing,
p135
aVlike the local food movement, for production.
p136
aVSo we've created formulations for all around the world
p137
aVusing regional byproducts.
p138
aVIf you're in China, you might use a rice husk
p139
aVor a cottonseed hull.
p140
aVIf you're in Northern Europe or North America,
p141
aVyou can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls.
p142
aVWe then process these husks with some basic equipment.
p143
aa(lp144
VAnd I want to share with you a quick video from our facility
p145
aVthat gives you a sense of how this looks at scale.
p146
aVSo what you're seeing here is actually cotton hulls from Texas, in this case.
p147
aVIt's a waste product.
p148
aVAnd what they're doing in our equipment
p149
aVis going through a continuous system,
p150
aVwhich cleans, cooks, cools
p151
aVand pasteurizes these materials,
p152
aVwhile also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium.
p153
aVThis gives us a continuous stream of material
p154
aVthat we can put into almost any shape,
p155
aVthough today we're making corner blocks.
p156
aVAnd it's when this lid goes on the part,
p157
aVthat the magic really starts.
p158
aVBecause the manufacturing process is our organism.
p159
aVIt'll actually begin to digest these wastes
p160
aVand, over the next five days,
p161
aVassemble them into biocomposites.
p162
aVOur entire facility
p163
aVis comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools
p164
aVsitting indoors in the dark, quietly self-assembling materials \u2014
p165
aVand everything from building materials
p166
aVto, in this case,
p167
aVa packaging corner block.
p168
aa(lp169
VSo I've said a number of times that we grow materials.
p170
aVAnd it's kind of hard to picture how that happens.
p171
aVSo my team has taken five days-worth of growth,
p172
aVa typical growth cycle for us,
p173
aVand condensed it into a 15-second time lapse.
p174
aVAnd I want you to really watch closely
p175
aVthese little white dots on the screen,
p176
aVbecause, over the five-day period,
p177
aVwhat they do is extend out and through this material,
p178
aVusing the energy that's contained in these seed husks
p179
aVto build this chitinous polymer matrix.
p180
aVThis matrix self-assembles,
p181
aVgrowing through and around the particles,
p182
aVmaking millions and millions of tiny fibers.
p183
aVAnd what parts of the seed husk we don't digest,
p184
aVactually become part of the final, physical composite.
p185
aVSo in front of your eyes, this part just self-assembled.
p186
aVIt actually takes a little longer. It takes five days.
p187
aVBut it's much faster than conventional farming.
p188
aa(lp189
VThe last step, of course, is application.
p190
aVIn this case, we've grown a corner block.
p191
aVA major Fortune 500 furniture maker
p192
aVuses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment.
p193
aVThey used to use a plastic packaging buffer,
p194
aVbut we were able to give them the exact same physical performance
p195
aVwith our grown material.
p196
aVBest of all, when it gets to the customer,
p197
aVit's not trash.
p198
aVThey can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing,
p199
aVand it's going to improve the local soil.
p200
aa(lp201
VSo, why mycelium?
p202
aVThe first reason is local open feedstocks.
p203
aVYou want to be able to do this anywhere in the world
p204
aVand not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls,
p205
aVbecause you have multiple choices.
p206
aVThe next is self-assembly,
p207
aVbecause the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process.
p208
aVYou don't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility.
p209
aVSo you can have lots of small facilities
p210
aVspread all across the world.
p211
aVBiological yield is really important.
p212
aVAnd because 100 percent of what we put in the tool become the final product,
p213
aVeven the parts that aren't digested
p214
aVbecome part of the structure,
p215
aVwe're getting incredible yield rates.
p216
aa(lp217
VNatural polymers, well ... I think that's what's most important,
p218
aVbecause these polymers have been tried and tested
p219
aVin our ecosystem for the last billion years,
p220
aVin everything from mushrooms to crustaceans.
p221
aVThey're not going to clog up Earth's ecosystems. They work great.
p222
aVAnd while, today,
p223
aVwe can practically guarantee that yesterday's packaging
p224
aVis going to be here in 10,000 years,
p225
aVwhat I want to guarantee
p226
aVis that in 10,000 years,
p227
aVour descendants, our children's children,
p228
aVwill be living happily and in harmony
p229
aVwith a healthy Earth.
p230
aVAnd I think that can be some really good news.
p231
