VEvery summer, my family and I travel across the world,
p4
aV3,000 miles away
p5
aVto the culturally diverse country of India.
p6
aVNow, India is a country infamous for its scorching heat and humidity.
p7
aVFor me, the only relief from this heat is to drink plenty of water.
p8
aVNow, while in India,
p9
aVmy parents always remind me to only drink boiled or bottled water,
p10
aVbecause unlike here in America,
p11
aVwhere I can just turn on a tap and easily get clean, potable water,
p12
aVin India, the water is often contaminated.
p13
aVSo my parents have to make sure
p14
aVthat the water we drink is safe.
p15
aa(lp16
VHowever, I soon realized
p17
aVthat not everyone is fortunate enough
p18
aVto enjoy the clean water we did.
p19
aVOutside my grandparents' house in the busy streets of India,
p20
aVI saw people standing in long lines
p21
aVunder the hot sun
p22
aVfilling buckets with water from a tap.
p23
aVI even saw children,
p24
aVwho looked the same age as me,
p25
aVfilling up these clear plastic bottles
p26
aVwith dirty water from streams on the roadside.
p27
aVWatching these kids
p28
aVforced to drink water
p29
aVthat I felt was too dirty to touch
p30
aVchanged my perspective on the world.
p31
aVThis unacceptable social injustice
p32
aVcompelled me to want to find a solution
p33
aVto our world's clean water problem.
p34
aVI wanted to know why these kids lacked water,
p35
aVa substance that is essential for life.
p36
aVAnd I learned that we are facing
p37
aVa global water crisis.
p38
aa(lp39
VNow, this may seem surprising,
p40
aVas 75 percent of our planet is covered in water,
p41
aVbut only 2.5 percent of that is freshwater,
p42
aVand less than one percent of Earth's freshwater supply
p43
aVis available for human consumption.
p44
aVWith rising populations,
p45
aVindustrial development and economic growth,
p46
aVour demand for clean water is increasing,
p47
aVyet our freshwater resources are rapidly depleting.
p48
aVAccording to the World Health Organization,
p49
aV660 million people in our world
p50
aVlack access to a clean water source.
p51
aVLack of access to clean water is a leading cause of death
p52
aVin children under the age of five in developing countries,
p53
aVand UNICEF estimates that 3,000 children
p54
aVdie every day from a water-related disease.
p55
aa(lp56
VSo after returning home one summer in eighth grade,
p57
aVI decided that I wanted to combine my passion
p58
aVfor solving the global water crisis
p59
aVwith my interest in science.
p60
aVSo I decided that the best thing to do
p61
aVwould be to convert my garage into a laboratory.
p62
aa(lp63
V(Laughter)
p64
aa(lp65
VActually, at first I converted my kitchen into a laboratory,
p66
aVbut my parents didn't really approve and kicked me out.
p67
aa(lp68
VI also read a lot of journal papers on water-related research,
p69
aVand I learned that currently in developing countries,
p70
aVsomething called solar disinfection,
p71
aVor SODIS, is used to purify water.
p72
aVIn SODIS, clear plastic bottles are filled with contaminated water
p73
aVand then exposed to sunlight for six to eight hours.
p74
aVThe UV radiation from the sun
p75
aVdestroys the DNA of these harmful pathogens
p76
aVand decontaminates the water.
p77
aVNow, while SODIS is really easy to use and energy-efficient,
p78
aVas it only uses solar energy,
p79
aVit's really slow,
p80
aVas it can take up to two days when it's cloudy.
p81
aVSo in order to make the SODIS process faster,
p82
aVthis new method called photocatalysis
p83
aVhas recently been used.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo what exactly is this photocatalysis?
p86
aVLet's break it down:
p87
aV"photo" means from the sun,
p88
aVand a catalyst is something that speeds up a reaction.
p89
aVSo what photocatalysis is doing
p90
aVis it's just speeding up this solar disinfection process.
p91
aVWhen sunlight comes in and strikes a photocatalyst,
p92
aVlike TiO2, or titanium dioxide,
p93
aVit creates these really reactive oxygen species,
p94
aVlike superoxides, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals.
p95
aVThese reactive oxygen species
p96
aVare able to remove bacteria and organics
p97
aVand a whole lot of contaminants from drinking water.
p98
aa(lp99
VBut unfortunately, there are several disadvantages
p100
aVto the way photocatalytic SODIS is currently deployed.
p101
aVSee, what they do is they take the clear plastic bottles
p102
aVand they coat the inside with this photocatalytic coating.
p103
aVBut photocatalysts like titanium dioxide
p104
aVare actually commonly used in sunscreens
p105
aVto block UV radiation.
p106
aVSo when they're coated on the inside of these bottles,
p107
aVthey're actually blocking some of the UV radiation
p108
aVand diminishing the efficiency of the process.
p109
aVAlso, these photocatalytic coatings
p110
aVare not tightly bound to the plastic bottle,
p111
aVwhich means they wash off, and people end up drinking the catalyst.
p112
aVWhile TiO2 is safe and inert,
p113
aVit's really inefficient if you keep drinking the catalyst,
p114
aVbecause then you have to continue to replenish it,
p115
aVeven after a few uses.
p116
aa(lp117
VSo my goal was to overcome the disadvantages
p118
aVof these current treatment methods
p119
aVand create a safe, sustainable,
p120
aVcost-effective and eco-friendly method of purifying water.
p121
aVWhat started off as an eighth grade science fair project
p122
aVis now my photocatalytic composite for water purification.
p123
aVThe composite combines titanium dioxide with cement.
p124
aVThe cement-like composite can be formed into several different shapes,
p125
aVwhich results in an extremely versatile range of deployment methods.
p126
aVFor example, you could create a rod
p127
aVthat can easily be placed inside water bottles for individual use
p128
aVor you could create a porous filter that can filter water for families.
p129
aVYou can even coat the inside of an existing water tank
p130
aVto purify larger amounts of water
p131
aVfor communities over a longer period of time.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow, over the course of this,
p134
aVmy journey hasn't really been easy.
p135
aVYou know, I didn't have access to a sophisticated laboratory.
p136
aVI was 14 years old when I started,
p137
aVbut I didn't let my age deter me
p138
aVin my interest in pursuing scientific research
p139
aVand wanting to solve the global water crisis.
p140
aa(lp141
VSee, water isn't just the universal solvent.
p142
aVWater is a universal human right.
p143
aVAnd for that reason,
p144
aVI'm continuing to work on this science fair project from 2012
p145
aVto bring it from the laboratory into the real world.
p146
aVAnd this summer, I founded Catalyst for World Water,
p147
aVa social enterprise aimed at catalyzing solutions to the global water crisis.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Applause)
p150
aa(lp151
VAlone, a single drop of water can't do much,
p152
aVbut when many drops come together,
p153
aVthey can sustain life on our planet.
p154
aVJust as water drops come together to form oceans,
p155
aVI believe that we all must come together
p156
aVwhen tackling this global problem.
p157
aa(lp158
VThank you.

p161
aa(lp162
