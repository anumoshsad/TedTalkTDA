VThe world is filled with incredible objects
p4
aVand rich cultural heritage.
p5
aVAnd when we get access to them,
p6
aVwe are blown away, we fall in love.
p7
aVBut most of the time,
p8
aVthe world's population is living without real access to arts and culture.
p9
aVWhat might the connections be when we start exploring our heritage,
p10
aVthe beautiful locations and the art in this world?
p11
aa(lp12
VBefore we get started in this presentation,
p13
aVI just want to take care of a few housekeeping points.
p14
aVFirst, I am no expert in art or culture.
p15
aVI fell into this by mistake, but I'm loving it.
p16
aVSecondly, all of what I'm going to show you
p17
aVbelongs to the amazing museums, archives and foundations
p18
aVthat we partner with.
p19
aVNone of this belongs to Google.
p20
aVAnd finally, what you see behind me
p21
aVis available right now on your mobile phones,
p22
aVon your laptops.
p23
aa(lp24
VThis is our current platform, where you can explore
p25
aVthousands of museums and objects at your fingertips,
p26
aVin extremely high-definition detail.
p27
aVThe diversity of the content is what's amazing.
p28
aVIf we just had European paintings,
p29
aVif we just had modern art,
p30
aVI think it gets a bit boring.
p31
aVFor example, this month, we launched the "Black History" channel
p32
aVwith 82 curated exhibitions,
p33
aVwhich talk about arts and culture in that community.
p34
aVWe also have some amazing objects from Japan,
p35
aVcentered around craftsmanship, called "Made in Japan."
p36
aVAnd one of my favorite exhibitions,
p37
aVwhich actually is the idea of my talk,
p38
aVis \u2014 I didn't expect to become a fan of Japanese dolls.
p39
aVBut I am, thanks to this exhibition,
p40
aVthat has really taught me about the craftsmanship
p41
aVbehind the soul of a Japanese doll.
p42
aVTrust me, it's very exciting.
p43
aVTake my word for it.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo, moving on swiftly.
p46
aVOne quick thing I wanted to showcase in this platform,
p47
aVwhich you can share with your kids and your friends right now,
p48
aVis you can travel to all these amazing institutions virtually, as well.
p49
aVOne of our recent ideas was with The Guggenheim Museum in New York,
p50
aVwhere you can get a taste of what it might feel like
p51
aVto actually be there.
p52
aVYou can go to the ground floor
p53
aVand obviously, most of you, I assume, have been there.
p54
aVAnd you can see the architectural masterpiece that it is.
p55
aVBut imagine this accessibility for a kid in Bombay
p56
aVwho's studying architecture,
p57
aVwho hasn't had a chance to go to The Guggenheim as yet.
p58
aVYou can obviously look at objects in the Guggenheim Museum,
p59
aVyou can obviously get into them and so on and so forth.
p60
aVThere's a lot of information here.
p61
aa(lp62
VBut this is not the purpose of my talk today.
p63
aVThis exists right now.
p64
aVWhat we now have are the building blocks to a very exciting future,
p65
aVwhen it comes to arts and culture
p66
aVand accessibility to arts and culture.
p67
aVSo I am joined today onstage by my good friend and artist in residence
p68
aVat our office in Paris, Cyril Diagne,
p69
aVwho is the professor of interactive design
p70
aVat ECAL University in Lausanne, Switzerland.
p71
aVWhat Cyril and our team of engineers have been doing
p72
aVis trying to find these connections and visualize a few of these.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo I'm going to go quite quick now.
p75
aVThis object you see behind me \u2014 oh, just clarification:
p76
aVAlways, seeing the real thing is better.
p77
aVIn case people think I'm trying to replicate the real thing.
p78
aVSo, moving on.
p79
aVThis object you see behind me is the Venus of Berekhat Ram.
p80
aVIt's one of the oldest objects in the world,
p81
aVfound in the Golan Heights around 233,000 years ago,
p82
aVand currently residing at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.
p83
aVIt is also one of the oldest objects on our platform.
p84
aa(lp85
VSo let's zoom.
p86
aVWe start from this one object.
p87
aVWhat if we zoomed out
p88
aVand actually tried to experience our own cultural big bang?
p89
aVWhat might that look like?
p90
aVThis is what we deal with on a daily basis at the Cultural Institute \u2014
p91
aVover six million cultural artifacts curated and given to us by institutions,
p92
aVto actually make these connections.
p93
aVYou can travel through time,
p94
aVyou can understand more about our society through these.
p95
aVYou can look at it from the perspective of our planet,
p96
aVand try to see how it might look without borders,
p97
aVif we just organized art and culture.
p98
aVWe can also then plot it by time,
p99
aVwhich obviously, for the data geek in me, is very fascinating.
p100
aVYou can spend hours looking at every decade
p101
aVand the contributions in that decade and in those years
p102
aVfor art, history and cultures.
p103
aVWe would love to spend hours showing you each and every decade,
p104
aVbut we don't have the time right now.
p105
aVSo you can go on your phone and actually do it yourself.
p106
aa(lp107
V(Applause)
p108
aa(lp109
VBut if you don't mind and can hold your applause till later,
p110
aVI don't want to run out of time,
p111
aVbecause I want to show you a lot of cool stuff.
p112
aa(lp113
VSo, just very quickly:
p114
aVyou can move on from here to another very interesting idea.
p115
aVBeyond the pretty picture,
p116
aVbeyond the nice visualization,
p117
aVwhat is the purpose, how is this useful?
p118
aVThis next idea comes from discussions with curators
p119
aVthat we've been having at museums,
p120
aVwho, by the way, I've fallen in love with,
p121
aVbecause they dedicate their whole life to try to tell these stories.
p122
aVOne of the curators told me, "Amit, what would it be like
p123
aVif you could create a virtual curator's table
p124
aVwhere all these six million objects
p125
aVare displayed in a way for us to look at the connections between them?"
p126
aVYou can spend a lot of time, trust me, looking at different objects
p127
aVand understanding where they come from.
p128
aVIt's a crazy Matrix experience.
p129
aa(lp130
V(Laughter)
p131
aa(lp132
VJust moving on,
p133
aVlet's take the world-famous Vincent Van Gogh,
p134
aVwho is very well-represented on this platform.
p135
aVThanks to the diversity of the institutions we have,
p136
aVwe have over 211 high-definition, amazing artworks by this artist,
p137
aVnow organized in one beautiful view.
p138
aVAnd as it resolves, and as Cyril goes deeper,
p139
aVyou can see all the self-portraits,
p140
aVyou can see still life.
p141
aVBut I just wanted to highlight one very quick example,
p142
aVwhich is very timely:
p143
aV"The Bedroom."
p144
aVThis is an artwork where three copies exist \u2014
p145
aVone at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam,
p146
aVone at the Orsay in Paris
p147
aVand one at the Art Institute of Chicago,
p148
aVwhich, actually, currently is hosting a reunion
p149
aVof all three artworks physically,
p150
aVI think only for the second time ever.
p151
aVBut, it is united digitally and virtually for anybody to look at
p152
aVin a very different way,
p153
aVand you won't get pushed in the line in the crowd.
p154
aVSo let's take you and let's travel through "The Bedroom" very quickly,
p155
aVso you can experience what we are doing for every single object.
p156
aVWe want the image to speak as much as it can
p157
aVon a digital platform.
p158
aVAnd all you need is an internet connection and a computer
p159
aa(lp160
V(Applause)
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd, Cyril, if you can go deeper, quickly.
p163
aVI'm sorry, this is all live,
p164
aVso you have to give Cyril a little bit of \u2014
p165
aVand this is available for every object:
p166
aVmodern art, contemporary art, Renaissance \u2014 you name it,
p167
aVeven sculpture.
p168
aa(lp169
VSometimes, you don't know what can attract you
p170
aVto an artwork or to a museum or to a cultural discovery.
p171
aVSo for me, personally, it was quite a challenge
p172
aVbecause when I decided to make this my full-time job at Google,
p173
aVmy mother was not very supportive.
p174
aVI love my mother,
p175
aVbut she thought I was wasting my life with this museum stuff.
p176
aVAnd for her, a museum is what you do when you go on vacation
p177
aVand you tick-mark and it's over, right?
p178
aVAnd it took around four and a half years
p179
aVfor me to convince my lovely Indian mother
p180
aVthat actually, this is worthwhile.
p181
aVAnd the way I did it was, I realized one day that she loves gold.
p182
aVSo I started showing her all objects that have the material gold in them.
p183
aVAnd the first thing my mom asks me is,
p184
aV"How can we buy these?"
p185
aa(lp186
V(Laughter)
p187
aa(lp188
VAnd obviously, my salary is not that high,
p189
aVso I was like, "We can't actually do that, mom.
p190
aVBut you can explore them virtually."
p191
aVAnd so now my mom \u2014 every time I meet her, she asks me,
p192
aV"Any more gold, any more silver in your project? Can you show me?"
p193
aVAnd that's the idea I'm trying to illustrate.
p194
aVIt does not matter how you get in,
p195
aVas long as you get in.
p196
aVOnce you get in, you're hooked.
p197
aa(lp198
VMoving on from here very quickly,
p199
aVthere is kind of a playful idea, actually,
p200
aVto illustrate the point of access,
p201
aVand I'm going to go quite quickly on this one.
p202
aVWe all know that seeing the artwork in person is amazing.
p203
aVBut we also know that most of us can't do it,
p204
aVand the ones that can afford to do it, it's complicated.
p205
aVSo \u2014 Cyril, can we load up our art trip, what do we call it?
p206
aVWe don't have a good name for this.
p207
aVBut essentially, we have around 1,000 amazing institutions,
p208
aV68 countries.
p209
aVBut let's start with Rembrandt.
p210
aVWe might have time for only one example.
p211
aVBut thanks to the diversity,
p212
aVwe've got around 500 amazing Rembrandt object artworks
p213
aVfrom 46 institutions and 17 countries.
p214
aVLet's say that on your next vacation,
p215
aVyou want to go see every single one of them.
p216
aVThat is your itinerary,
p217
aVyou will probably travel 53,000 kilometers,
p218
aVvisit around, I think, 46 institutions,
p219
aVand just FYI, you might release 10 tons of CO2 emissions.
p220
aa(lp221
V(Laughter)
p222
aa(lp223
VBut remember, it's art,
p224
aVso you can justify it, perhaps, in some way.
p225
aa(lp226
VMoving on swiftly from here,
p227
aVis something a little bit more technical and more interesting.
p228
aVAll that we've shown you so far uses metadata to make the connections.
p229
aVBut obviously we have something cool nowadays
p230
aVthat everyone likes to talk about, which is machine learning.
p231
aVSo what we thought is, let's strip out all the metadata,
p232
aVlet's look at what machine learning can do
p233
aVbased purely on visual recognition of this entire collection.
p234
aVWhat we ended up with is this very interesting map,
p235
aVthese clusters that have no reference point information,
p236
aVbut has just used visuals to cluster things together.
p237
aVEach cluster is an art to us by itself of discovery.
p238
aVBut one of the clusters we want to show you very quickly
p239
aVis this amazing cluster of portraits
p240
aVthat we found from museums around the world.
p241
aVIf you could zoom in a little bit more, Cyril.
p242
aVJust to show you, you can just travel through portraits.
p243
aVAnd essentially, you can do nature, you can do horses
p244
aVand clusters galore.
p245
aa(lp246
VWhen we saw all these portraits,
p247
aVwe were like, "Hey, can we do something fun for kids,
p248
aVor can we do something playful
p249
aVto get people interested in portraits?"
p250
aVBecause I haven't really seen
p251
aVyoung kids really excited to go to a portrait gallery.
p252
aVI wanted to try to figure something out.
p253
aVSo we created something called the portrait matcher.
p254
aVIt's quite self-explanatory,
p255
aVso I'm just going to let Cyril show his beautiful face.
p256
aVAnd essentially what's happening is, with the movement of his head,
p257
aVwe are matching different portraits around the world from museums.
p258
aa(lp259
V(Applause)
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd I don't know about you,
p262
aVbut I've shown it to my nephew and sister,
p263
aVand the reaction is just phenomenal.
p264
aVAll they ask me is, "When can we go see this?"
p265
aVAnd by the way, if we're nice,
p266
aVmaybe, Cyril, you can smile and find a happy one?
p267
aVOh, perfect.
p268
aVBy the way, this is not rehearsed.
p269
aVCongrats, Cyril. Great stuff. Oh wow.
p270
aVOK, let's move on; otherwise, this will just take the whole time.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Applause)
p273
aa(lp274
VSo, art and culture can be fun also, right?
p275
aVFor our last quick experiment \u2014
p276
aVwe call all of these "experiments" \u2014
p277
aVour last quick experiment comes back to machine learning.
p278
aVWe show you clusters, visual clusters,
p279
aVbut what if we could ask the machine to also name these clusters?
p280
aVWhat if it could automatically tag them, using no actual metadata?
p281
aVSo what we have is this kind of explorer,
p282
aVwhere we have managed to match, I think, around 4,000 labels.
p283
aVAnd we haven't really done anything special here,
p284
aVjust fed the collection.
p285
aVAnd we found interesting categories.
p286
aVWe can start with horses, a very straightforward category.
p287
aVYou would expect to see that the machine has put
p288
aVimages of horses, right?
p289
aVAnd it has, but you also notice, right over there,
p290
aVthat it has a very abstract image
p291
aVthat it has still managed to recognize and cluster as horses.
p292
aVWe also have an amazing head in terms of a horse.
p293
aVAnd each one has the tags as to why it got categorized in this.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo let's move to another one which I found very funny and interesting,
p296
aVbecause I don't understand how this category came up.
p297
aVIt's called "Lady in Waiting."
p298
aVIf, Cyril, you do it very quickly,
p299
aVyou will see that we have these amazing images
p300
aVof ladies, I guess, in waiting or posing.
p301
aVI don't really understand it.
p302
aVBut I've been trying to ask my museum contacts,
p303
aVyou know, "What is this? What's going on here?"
p304
aVAnd it's fascinating.
p305
aa(lp306
VComing back to gold very quickly,
p307
aVI wanted to search for gold
p308
aVand see how the machine tagged all the gold.
p309
aVBut, actually, it doesn't tag it as gold.
p310
aVWe are living in popular times.
p311
aVIt tags it as "bling-bling."
p312
aa(lp313
V(Laughter)
p314
aa(lp315
VI'm being hard on Cyril, because I'm moving too fast.
p316
aVEssentially, here you have all the bling-bling
p317
aVof the world's museums organized for you.
p318
aa(lp319
VAnd finally, to end this talk and these experiments,
p320
aVwhat I hope you feel after this talk is happiness and emotion.
p321
aVAnd what would we see when we see happiness?
p322
aVIf we actually look at all the objects
p323
aVthat have been tagged under "happiness,"
p324
aVyou would expect happiness, I guess.
p325
aVBut there was one that came up that was very fascinating and interesting,
p326
aVwhich was this artwork by Douglas Coupland,
p327
aVour friend and artist in residence as well,
p328
aVcalled, "I Miss My Pre-Internet Brain."
p329
aVI don't know why the machine feels like it misses its pre-Internet brain
p330
aVand it's been tagged here,
p331
aVbut it's a very interesting thought.
p332
aVI sometimes do miss my pre-Internet brain,
p333
aVbut not when it comes to exploring arts and culture online.
p334
aa(lp335
VSo take out your phones, take out your computers,
p336
aVgo visit museums.
p337
aVAnd just a quick call-out to all the amazing archivists,
p338
aVhistorians, curators,
p339
aVwho are sitting in museums, preserving all this culture.
p340
aVAnd the least we can do is get our daily dose of art and culture
p341
aVfor ourselves and our kids.
p342
aa(lp343
VThank you.
