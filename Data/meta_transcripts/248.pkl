VHow does the news shape the way we see the world?
p4
aVHere's the world based on the way it looks \u2014 based on landmass.
p5
aVAnd here's how news shapes what Americans see.
p6
aVThis map \u2014 (Applause) \u2014 this map shows the number of seconds
p7
aVthat American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories,
p8
aVby country, in February of 2007 \u2014 just one year ago.
p9
aVNow, this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities.
p10
aVThere was massive flooding in Indonesia.
p11
aVAnd in Paris, the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming.
p12
aVThe U.S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage.
p13
aVAnd when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining 21 percent,
p14
aVwe see a lot of Iraq \u2014 that's that big green thing there \u2014 and little else.
p15
aVThe combined coverage of Russia, China and India, for example, reached just one percent.
p16
aa(lp17
VWhen we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story,
p18
aVhere's how the world looked.
p19
aVWhat was that story? The death of Anna Nicole Smith.
p20
aVThis story eclipsed every country except Iraq,
p21
aVand received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report.
p22
aVAnd the cycle continues;
p23
aVas we all know, Britney has loomed pretty large lately.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo, why don't we hear more about the world?
p26
aVOne reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half.
p27
aVAside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi, New Delhi and Mumbai,
p28
aVthere are no network news bureaus in all of Africa, India or South America
p29
aV\u2014 places that are home to more than two billion people.
p30
aa(lp31
VThe reality is that covering Britney is cheaper.
p32
aVAnd this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing
p33
aVwhen we see where people go for news.
p34
aVLocal TV news looms large,
p35
aVand unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news.
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd what about the web?
p38
aVThe most popular news sites don't do much better.
p39
aVLast year, Pew and the Colombia J-School analyzed the 14,000 stories
p40
aVthat appeared on Google News' front page.
p41
aVAnd they, in fact, covered the same 24 news events.
p42
aVSimilarly, a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creators
p43
aVis recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters,
p44
aVand don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it.
p45
aa(lp46
VSo, if you put it all together, this could help explain why today's college graduates,
p47
aVas well as less educated Americans,
p48
aVknow less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago.
p49
aVAnd if you think it's simply because we are not interested,
p50
aVyou would be wrong.
p51
aVIn recent years, Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time
p52
aVgrew to over 50 percent.
p53
aa(lp54
VThe real question: is this distorted worldview what we want for Americans
p55
aVin our increasingly interconnected world?
p56
aVI know we can do better.
p57
aVAnd can we afford not to? Thank you.
