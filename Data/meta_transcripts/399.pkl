VI thought I'd start with telling you or showing you the people who started [Jet Propulsion Lab].
p4
aVWhen they were a bunch of kids,
p5
aVthey were kind of very imaginative, very adventurous,
p6
aVas they were trying at Caltech to mix chemicals
p7
aVand see which one blows up more.
p8
aVWell, I don't recommend that you try to do that now.
p9
aVNaturally, they blew up a shack, and Caltech, well, then,
p10
aVhey, you go to the Arroyo and really do all your tests in there.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo, that's what we call our first five employees
p13
aVduring the tea break, you know, in here.
p14
aVAs I said, they were adventurous people.
p15
aVAs a matter of fact, one of them, who was, kind of, part of a cult
p16
aVwhich was not too far from here on Orange Grove,
p17
aVand unfortunately he blew up himself because he kept mixing chemicals
p18
aVand trying to figure out which ones were the best chemicals.
p19
aVSo, that gives you a kind of flavor
p20
aVof the kind of people we have there.
p21
aVWe try to avoid blowing ourselves up.
p22
aa(lp23
VThis one I thought I'd show you.
p24
aVGuess which one is a JPL employee in the heart of this crowd.
p25
aVI tried to come like him this morning,
p26
aVbut as I walked out, then it was too cold,
p27
aVand I said, I'd better put my shirt back on.
p28
aVBut more importantly, the reason I wanted to show this picture:
p29
aVlook where the other people are looking,
p30
aVand look where he is looking.
p31
aVWherever anybody else looks, look somewhere else,
p32
aVand go do something different, you know, and doing that.
p33
aVAnd that's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd I want to tell you a quote from Ralph Emerson
p36
aVthat one of my colleagues, you know, put on my wall in my office,
p37
aVand it says, "Do not go where the path may lead.
p38
aVGo instead where there is no path, and leave a trail."
p39
aVAnd that's my recommendation to all of you:
p40
aVlook what everybody is doing, what they are doing;
p41
aVgo do something completely different.
p42
aVDon't try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing,
p43
aVbecause that doesn't get you very far.
p44
aa(lp45
VIn our early days we used to work a lot on rockets,
p46
aVbut we also used to have a lot of parties, you know.
p47
aVAs you can see, one of our parties, you know, a few years ago.
p48
aVBut then a big difference happened about 50 years ago,
p49
aVafter Sputnik was launched. We launched the first American satellite,
p50
aVand that's the one you see on the left in there.
p51
aVAnd here we made 180 degrees change:
p52
aVwe changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house.
p53
aVAnd that was done over a period of a couple of years,
p54
aVand now we are the leading organization, you know,
p55
aVexploring space on all of your behalf.
p56
aa(lp57
VBut even when we did that, we had to remind ourselves,
p58
aVsometimes there are setbacks.
p59
aVSo you see, on the bottom, that rocket was supposed to go upward;
p60
aVsomehow it ended going sideways.
p61
aVSo that's what we call the misguided missile.
p62
aVBut then also, just to celebrate that,
p63
aVwe started an event at JPL for "Miss Guided Missile."
p64
aa(lp65
VSo, we used to have a celebration every year and select \u2014
p66
aVthere used to be competition and parades and so on.
p67
aVIt's not very appropriate to do it now. Some people tell me to do it;
p68
aVI think, well, that's not really proper, you know, these days.
p69
aVSo, we do something a little bit more serious.
p70
aVAnd that's what you see in the last Rose Bowl, you know,
p71
aVwhen we entered one of the floats.
p72
aVThat's more on the play side. And on the right side,
p73
aVthat's the Rover just before we finished its testing
p74
aVto take it to the Cape to launch it.
p75
aVThese are the Rovers up here that you have on Mars now.
p76
aVSo that kind of tells you about, kind of, the fun things,
p77
aVyou know, and the serious things that we try to do.
p78
aVBut I said I'm going to show you a short clip
p79
aVof one of our employees to kind of give you an idea
p80
aVabout some of the talent that we have.
p81
aa(lp82
VVideo: Morgan Hendry: Beware of Safety is
p83
aVan instrumental rock band.
p84
aVIt branches on more the experimental side.
p85
aVThere's the improvisational side of jazz.
p86
aVThere's the heavy-hitting sound of rock.
p87
aVBeing able to treat sound as an instrument, and be able to dig
p88
aVfor more abstract sounds and things to play live,
p89
aVmixing electronics and acoustics.
p90
aVThe music's half of me, but the other half \u2014
p91
aVI landed probably the best gig of all.
p92
aVI work for the Jet Propulsion Lab. I'm building the next Mars Rover.
p93
aVSome of the most brilliant engineers I know
p94
aVare the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them.
p95
aVYou've got to do what you want to do.
p96
aVAnd anyone who tells you you can't, you don't listen to them.
p97
aVMaybe they're right - I doubt it.
p98
aVTell them where to put it, and then just do what you want to do.
p99
aVI'm Morgan Hendry. I am NASA.
p100
aa(lp101
VCharles Elachi: Now, moving from the play stuff to the serious stuff,
p102
aValways people ask, why do we explore?
p103
aVWhy are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them?
p104
aVWell, the way I think about it is fairly simple.
p105
aVSomehow, 13 billion years ago there was a Big Bang, and you've heard
p106
aVa little bit about, you know, the origin of the universe.
p107
aVBut somehow what strikes everybody's imagination \u2014
p108
aVor lots of people's imagination \u2014 somehow from that original Big Bang
p109
aVwe have this beautiful world that we live in today.
p110
aa(lp111
VYou look outside: you have all that beauty that you see,
p112
aVall that life that you see around you,
p113
aVand here we have intelligent people like you and I
p114
aVwho are having a conversation here.
p115
aVAll that started from that Big Bang. So, the question is:
p116
aVHow did that happen? How did that evolve? How did the universe form?
p117
aVHow did the galaxies form? How did the planets form?
p118
aVWhy is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved?
p119
aVIs that very common?
p120
aVIs there life on every planet that you can see around the stars?
p121
aVSo we literally are all made out of stardust.
p122
aVWe started from those stars; we are made of stardust.
p123
aVSo, next time you are really depressed, look in the mirror
p124
aVand you can look and say, hi, I'm looking at a star here.
p125
aVYou can skip the dust part.
p126
aVBut literally, we are all made of stardust.
p127
aa(lp128
VSo, what we are trying to do in our exploration is effectively
p129
aVwrite the book of how things have came about as they are today.
p130
aVAnd one of the first, or the easiest, places we can go
p131
aVand explore that is to go towards Mars.
p132
aVAnd the reason Mars takes particular attention:
p133
aVit's not very far from us.
p134
aVYou know, it'll take us only six months to get there.
p135
aVSix to nine months at the right time of the year.
p136
aVIt's a planet somewhat similar to Earth. It's a little bit smaller,
p137
aVbut the land mass on Mars is about the same
p138
aVas the land mass on Earth, you know,
p139
aVif you don't take the oceans into account.
p140
aVIt has polar caps. It has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours,
p141
aVso it has weather. So, it's very similar to some extent,
p142
aVand you can see some of the features on it,
p143
aVlike the Grand Canyon on Mars,
p144
aVor what we call the Grand Canyon on Mars.
p145
aVIt is like the Grand Canyon on Earth, except a hell of a lot larger.
p146
aa(lp147
VSo it's about the size, you know, of the United States.
p148
aVIt has volcanoes on it. And that's Mount Olympus on Mars,
p149
aVwhich is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet.
p150
aVAnd if you look at the height of it
p151
aVand you compare it to Mount Everest, you see, it'll give you
p152
aVan idea of how large that Mount Olympus, you know, is,
p153
aVrelative to Mount Everest.
p154
aVSo, it basically dwarfs, you know, Mount Everest here on Earth.
p155
aVSo, that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or volcanic events
p156
aVwhich have happened on that planet.
p157
aVRecently from one of our satellites, this shows that it's Earth-like \u2014
p158
aVwe caught a landslide occurring as it was happening.
p159
aVSo it is a dynamic planet,
p160
aVand activity is going on as we speak today.
p161
aa(lp162
VAnd these Rovers, people wonder now, what are they doing today,
p163
aVso I thought I would show you a little bit what they are doing.
p164
aVThis is one very large crater. Geologists love craters,
p165
aVbecause craters are like digging a big hole in the ground
p166
aVwithout really working at it,
p167
aVand you can see what's below the surface.
p168
aVSo, this is called Victoria Crater,
p169
aVwhich is about a few football fields in size.
p170
aVAnd if you look at the top left, you see a little teeny dark dot.
p171
aVThis picture was taken from an orbiting satellite.
p172
aVIf I zoom on it, you can see: that's the Rover on the surface.
p173
aVSo, that was taken from orbit; we had the camera zoom on the surface,
p174
aVand we actually saw the Rover on the surface.
p175
aVAnd we actually used the combination of the satellite images
p176
aVand the Rover to actually conduct science,
p177
aVbecause we can observe large areas
p178
aVand then you can get those Rovers to move around
p179
aVand basically go to a certain location.
p180
aa(lp181
VSo, specifically what we are doing now is
p182
aVthat Rover is going down in that crater.
p183
aVAs I told you, geologists love craters.
p184
aVAnd the reason is, many of you went to the Grand Canyon,
p185
aVand you see in the wall of the Grand Canyon, you see these layers.
p186
aVAnd what these layers \u2014 that's what the surface used to be
p187
aVa million years ago, 10 million years ago,
p188
aV100 million years ago, and you get deposits on top of them.
p189
aVSo if you can read the layers it's like reading your book,
p190
aVand you can learn the history of what happened in the past
p191
aVin that location.
p192
aa(lp193
VSo what you are seeing here are the layers on the wall
p194
aVof that crater, and the Rover is going down now, measuring, you know,
p195
aVthe properties and analyzing the rocks
p196
aVas it's going down, you know, that canyon.
p197
aVNow, it's kind of a little bit of a challenge driving
p198
aVdown a slope like this.
p199
aVIf you were there you wouldn't do it yourself.
p200
aVBut we really made sure we tested those Rovers
p201
aVbefore we got them down \u2014 or that Rover \u2014
p202
aVand made sure that it's all working well.
p203
aa(lp204
VNow, when I came last time, shortly after the landing \u2014
p205
aVI think it was, like, a hundred days after the landing \u2014
p206
aVI told you I was surprised that those Rovers
p207
aVare lasting even a hundred days.
p208
aVWell, here we are four years later, and they're still working.
p209
aVNow you say, Charles, you are really lying to us, and so on,
p210
aVbut that's not true. We really believed they were going to last
p211
aV90 days or 100 days, because they are solar powered,
p212
aVand Mars is a dusty planet, so we expected the dust
p213
aVwould start accumulating on the surface, and after a while
p214
aVwe wouldn't have enough power, you know, to keep them warm.
p215
aa(lp216
VWell, I always say it's important that you are smart,
p217
aVbut every once in a while it's good to be lucky.
p218
aVAnd that's what we found out. It turned out that every once in a while
p219
aVthere are dust devils which come by on Mars, as you are seeing here,
p220
aVand when the dust devil comes over the Rover, it just cleans it up.
p221
aVIt is like a brand new car that you have,
p222
aVand that's literally why they have lasted so long.
p223
aVAnd now we designed them reasonably well,
p224
aVbut that's exactly why they are lasting that long
p225
aVand still providing all the science data.
p226
aVNow, the two Rovers, each one of them is, kind of, getting old.
p227
aVYou know, one of them, one of the wheels is stuck, is not working,
p228
aVone of the front wheels, so what we are doing,
p229
aVwe are driving it backwards.
p230
aVAnd the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint, you know,
p231
aVit's not working very well, so it's walking like this,
p232
aVand we can move the arm, you know, that way.
p233
aVBut still they are producing a lot of scientific data.
p234
aVNow, during that whole period, a number of people got excited,
p235
aVyou know, outside the science community about these Rovers,
p236
aVso I thought I'd show you a video just to give you a reflection
p237
aVabout how these Rovers are being viewed by people
p238
aVother than the science community.
p239
aa(lp240
VSo let me go on the next short video.
p241
aVBy the way, this video is pretty accurate of how the landing took place, you know,
p242
aVabout four years ago.
p243
aVVideo: Okay, we have parachute aligned.
p244
aVOkay, deploy the airbags. Open.
p245
aVCamera. We have a picture right now.
p246
aVYeah!
p247
aVCE: That's about what happened in the Houston operation room. It's exactly like this.
p248
aVVideo: Now, if there is life, the Dutch will find it.
p249
aVWhat is he doing?
p250
aVWhat is that?
p251
aVCE: Not too bad.
p252
aa(lp253
VSo anyway, let me continue on showing you a little bit
p254
aVabout the beauty of that planet.
p255
aVAs I said earlier, it looked very much like Earth,
p256
aVso you see sand dunes.
p257
aVIt looks like I could have told you these are pictures taken
p258
aVfrom the Sahara Desert or somewhere, and you'd have believed me,
p259
aVbut these are pictures taken from Mars.
p260
aVBut one area which is particularly intriguing for us
p261
aVis the northern region, you know, of Mars, close to the North Pole,
p262
aVbecause we see ice caps, and we see the ice caps shrinking
p263
aVand expanding, so it's very much like you have in northern Canada.
p264
aVAnd we wanted to find out \u2014 and we see all kinds of glacial features on it.
p265
aVSo, we wanted to find out, actually,
p266
aVwhat is that ice made of, and could that have embedded in it
p267
aVsome organic, you know, material.
p268
aa(lp269
VSo we have a spacecraft which is heading towards Mars,
p270
aVcalled Phoenix, and that spacecraft will land
p271
aV17 days, seven hours and 20 seconds from now,
p272
aVso you can adjust your watch.
p273
aVSo it's on May 25 around just before five o'clock our time here
p274
aVon the West Coast, actually we will be landing on another planet.
p275
aVAnd as you can see, this is a picture of the spacecraft put on Mars,
p276
aVbut I thought that just in case you're going to miss that show, you know,
p277
aVin 17 days, I'll show you, kind of,
p278
aVa little bit of what's going to happen.
p279
aa(lp280
VVideo: That's what we call the seven minutes of terror.
p281
aVSo the plan is to dig in the soil and take samples
p282
aVthat we put them in an oven and actually heat them
p283
aVand look what gases will come from it.
p284
aVSo this was launched about nine months ago.
p285
aVWe'll be coming in at 12,000 miles per hour, and in seven minutes
p286
aVwe have to stop and touch the surface very softly
p287
aVso we don't break that lander.
p288
aa(lp289
VBen Cichy: Phoenix is the first Mars Scout mission.
p290
aVIt's the first mission that's going to try to land
p291
aVnear the North Pole of Mars, and it's the first mission
p292
aVthat's actually going to try and reach out and touch water
p293
aVon the surface of another planet.
p294
aa(lp295
VLynn Craig: Where there tends to be water, at least on Earth,
p296
aVthere tends to be life, and so it's potentially a place
p297
aVwhere life could have existed on the planet in the past.
p298
aa(lp299
VErik Bailey: The main purpose of EDL is to take a spacecraft that is traveling
p300
aVat 12,500 miles an hour and bring it to a screeching halt
p301
aVin a soft way in a very short amount of time.
p302
aVBC: We enter the Martian atmosphere.
p303
aVWe're 70 miles above the surface of Mars.
p304
aVAnd our lander is safely tucked inside what we call an aeroshell.
p305
aa(lp306
VEB: Looks kind of like an ice cream cone, more or less.
p307
aa(lp308
VBC: And on the front of it is this heat shield,
p309
aVthis saucer-looking thing that has about a half-inch
p310
aVof essentially what's cork on the front of it,
p311
aVwhich is our heat shield.
p312
aVNow, this is really special cork,
p313
aVand this cork is what's going to protect us
p314
aVfrom the violent atmospheric entry that we're about to experience.
p315
aa(lp316
VRob Grover: Friction really starts to build up on the spacecraft,
p317
aVand we use the friction when it's flying through the atmosphere
p318
aVto our advantage to slow us down.
p319
aVBC: From this point, we're going to decelerate from 12,500 miles an hour
p320
aVdown to 900 miles an hour.
p321
aa(lp322
VEB: The outside can get almost as hot as the surface of the Sun.
p323
aa(lp324
VRG: The temperature of the heat shield can reach 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit.
p325
aa(lp326
VEB: The inside doesn't get very hot.
p327
aVIt probably gets about room temperature.
p328
aVRichard Kornfeld: There is this window of opportunity
p329
aVwithin which we can deploy the parachute.
p330
aa(lp331
VEB: If you fire the 'chute too early, the parachute itself could fail.
p332
aVThe fabric and the stitching could just pull apart.
p333
aVAnd that would be bad.
p334
aa(lp335
VBC: In the first 15 seconds after we deploy the parachute,
p336
aVwe'll decelerate from 900 miles an hour
p337
aVto a relatively slow 250 miles an hour.
p338
aVWe no longer need the heat shield to protect us
p339
aVfrom the force of atmospheric entry, so we jettison the heat shield,
p340
aVexposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of Mars.
p341
aa(lp342
VLC: After the heat shield has been jettisoned and the legs are deployed,
p343
aVthe next step is to have the radar system begin to detect
p344
aVhow far Phoenix really is from the ground.
p345
aa(lp346
VBC: We've lost 99 percent of our entry velocity.
p347
aVSo, we're 99 percent of the way to where we want to be.
p348
aVBut that last one percent, as it always seems to be, is the tricky part.
p349
aa(lp350
VEB: Now the spacecraft actually has to decide
p351
aVwhen it's going to get rid of its parachute.
p352
aa(lp353
VBC: We separate from the lander going 125 miles an hour
p354
aVat roughly a kilometer above the surface of Mars: 3,200 feet.
p355
aVThat's like taking two Empire State Buildings
p356
aVand stacking them on top of one another.
p357
aa(lp358
VEB: That's when we separate from the back shell,
p359
aVand we're now in free-fall.
p360
aVIt's a very scary moment; a lot has to happen
p361
aVin a very short amount of time.
p362
aVLC: So it's in a free-fall,
p363
aVbut it's also trying to use all of its actuators
p364
aVto make sure that it's in the right position to land.
p365
aa(lp366
VEB: And then it has to light up its engines, right itself,
p367
aVand then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely.
p368
aa(lp369
VBC: Earth and Mars are so far apart that it takes over ten minutes
p370
aVfor a signal from Mars to get to Earth.
p371
aVAnd EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes.
p372
aVSo by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started
p373
aVit'll already be over.
p374
aa(lp375
VEB: We have to build large amounts of autonomy into the spacecraft
p376
aVso that it can land itself safely.
p377
aa(lp378
VBC: EDL is this immense, technically challenging problem.
p379
aVIt's about getting a spacecraft that's hurtling through deep space
p380
aVand using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out
p381
aVhow to get it down to the surface of Mars at zero miles an hour.
p382
aVIt's this immensely exciting and challenging problem.
p383
aa(lp384
VCE: Hopefully it all will happen the way you saw it in here.
p385
aVSo it will be a very tense moment, you know,
p386
aVas we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet.
p387
aa(lp388
VSo now let me talk about the next things that we are doing.
p389
aVSo we are in the process, as we speak, of actually designing
p390
aVthe next Rover that we are going to be sending to Mars.
p391
aVSo I thought I would go a little bit and tell you, kind of,
p392
aVthe steps we go through.
p393
aVIt's very similar to what you do when you design your product.
p394
aVAs you saw a little bit earlier,
p395
aVwhen we were doing the Phoenix one,
p396
aVwe have to take into account the heat that we are going to be facing.
p397
aVSo we have to study all kinds of different materials,
p398
aVthe shape that we want to do.
p399
aVIn general we don't try to please the customer here.
p400
aVWhat we want to do is to make sure we have an effective, you know,
p401
aVan efficient kind of machine.
p402
aa(lp403
VFirst we start by we want to have our employees
p404
aVto be as imaginative as they can.
p405
aVAnd we really love being close to the art center, because we have,
p406
aVas a matter of fact, one of the alumni from the art center,
p407
aVEric Nyquist, had put a series of displays,
p408
aVfar-out displays, you know,
p409
aVin our what we call mission design or spacecraft design room,
p410
aVjust to get people to think wildly about things.
p411
aVWe have a bunch of Legos. So, as I said,
p412
aVthis is a playground for adults, where they sit down and try to play
p413
aVwith different shapes and different designs.
p414
aa(lp415
VThen we get a little bit more serious, so we have
p416
aVwhat we call our CAD/CAMs and all the engineers who are involved,
p417
aVor scientists who are involved, who know about thermal properties,
p418
aVknow about design, know about atmospheric interaction, parachutes,
p419
aVall of these things, which they work in a team effort
p420
aVand actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent,
p421
aVso to see, does that meet the requirement that we need.
p422
aVOn the right, also, we have to take into account
p423
aVthe environment of the planet where we are going.
p424
aVIf you are going to Jupiter, you have a very high-radiation,
p425
aVyou know, environment. It's about the same radiation environment
p426
aVclose by Jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor.
p427
aa(lp428
VSo just imagine: you take your P.C. and throw it into a nuclear reactor
p429
aVand it still has to work.
p430
aVSo these are kind of some of the little challenges, you know,
p431
aVthat we have to face.
p432
aVIf we are doing entry, we have to do tests of parachutes.
p433
aVYou saw in the video a parachute breaking. That would be a bad day,
p434
aVyou know, if that happened, so we have to test,
p435
aVbecause we are deploying this parachute at supersonic speeds.
p436
aVWe are coming at extremely high speeds, and we are deploying them
p437
aVto slow us down. So we have to do all kinds of tests.
p438
aVTo give you an idea of the size, you know, of that parachute
p439
aVrelative to the people standing there.
p440
aa(lp441
VNext step, we go and actually build some kind of test models
p442
aVand actually test them, you know, in the lab at JPL,
p443
aVin what we call our Mars Yard.
p444
aVWe kick them, we hit them, we drop them,
p445
aVjust to make sure we understand how, where would they break.
p446
aVAnd then we back off, you know, from that point.
p447
aVAnd then we actually do the actual building and the flight.
p448
aVAnd this next Rover that we're flying is about the size of a car.
p449
aVThat big shield that you see outside,
p450
aVthat's a heat shield which is going to protect it.
p451
aVAnd that will be basically built over the next year,
p452
aVand it will be launched June a year from now.
p453
aVNow, in that case, because it was a very big Rover,
p454
aVwe couldn't use airbags.
p455
aVAnd I know many of you, kind of, last time afterwards said
p456
aVwell, that was a cool thing to have \u2014 those airbags.
p457
aVUnfortunately this Rover is, like, ten times the size of the, you know,
p458
aVmass-wise, of the other Rover, or three times the mass.
p459
aVSo we can't use airbags. So we have to come up with
p460
aVanother ingenious idea of how do we land it.
p461
aVAnd we didn't want to take it propulsively all the way to the surface
p462
aVbecause we didn't want to contaminate the surface;
p463
aVwe wanted the Rover to immediately land on its legs.
p464
aa(lp465
VSo we came up with this ingenious idea,
p466
aVwhich is used here on Earth for helicopters.
p467
aVActually, the lander will come down to about 100 feet and hover
p468
aVabove that surface for 100 feet, and then we have a sky crane
p469
aVwhich will take that Rover and land it down on the surface.
p470
aVHopefully it all will work, you know, it will work that way.
p471
aVAnd that Rover will be more kind of like a chemist.
p472
aVWhat we are going to be doing with that Rover as it drives around,
p473
aVit's going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks.
p474
aVSo it will have an arm which will take samples,
p475
aVput them in an oven, crush and analyze them.
p476
aVBut also, if there is something that we cannot reach
p477
aVbecause it is too high on a cliff, we have a little laser system
p478
aVwhich will actually zap the rock, evaporate some of it,
p479
aVand actually analyze what's coming from that rock.
p480
aVSo it's a little bit like "Star Wars," you know, but it's real.
p481
aVIt's real stuff.
p482
aVAnd also to help you, to help the community
p483
aVso you can do ads on that Rover, we are going to train that Rover
p484
aVto actually in addition to do this, to actually serve cocktails,
p485
aVyou know, also on Mars.
p486
aa(lp487
VSo that's kind of giving you an idea of the kind of, you know,
p488
aVfun things we are doing on Mars.
p489
aVI thought I'd go to "The Lord of the Rings" now
p490
aVand show you some of the things we have there.
p491
aVNow, "The Lord of the Rings" has two things played through it.
p492
aVOne, it's a very attractive planet \u2014
p493
aVit just has the beauty of the rings and so on.
p494
aVBut for scientists, also the rings have a special meaning,
p495
aVbecause we believe they represent, on a small scale,
p496
aVhow the Solar System actually formed.
p497
aVSome of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed,
p498
aVthat the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun,
p499
aVa lot of the dust around it created rings
p500
aVand then the particles in those rings accumulated together,
p501
aVand they formed bigger rocks, and then that's how the planets,
p502
aVyou know, were formed.
p503
aa(lp504
VSo, the idea is, by watching Saturn we're actually watching
p505
aVour solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale,
p506
aVso it's like a test bed for it.
p507
aVSo, let me show you a little bit
p508
aVon what that Saturnian system looks like.
p509
aVFirst, I'm going to fly you over the rings.
p510
aVBy the way, all of this is real stuff.
p511
aVThis is not animation or anything like this.
p512
aVThis is actually taken from the satellite
p513
aVthat we have in orbit around Saturn, the Cassini.
p514
aVAnd you see the amount of detail that is in those rings,
p515
aVwhich are the particles.
p516
aVSome of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles.
p517
aVSo that's why you have these gaps, is because a small satellite, you know,
p518
aVis being formed in that location.
p519
aVNow, you think that those rings are very large objects.
p520
aVYes, they are very large in one dimension;
p521
aVin the other dimension they are paper thin. Very, very thin.
p522
aVWhat you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on Saturn itself.
p523
aVAnd that's one of the satellites
p524
aVwhich was actually formed on that one.
p525
aVSo, think about it as a paper-thin,
p526
aVhuge area of many hundreds of thousands of miles, which is rotating.
p527
aa(lp528
VAnd we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form,
p529
aVeach one looking very different and very odd, and that keeps
p530
aVscientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this,
p531
aVand telling NASA we need more money so we can explain
p532
aVwhat these things look like, or why they formed that way.
p533
aVWell, there were two satellites which were particularly interesting.
p534
aVOne of them is called Enceladus.
p535
aVIt's a satellite which was all made of ice,
p536
aVand we measured it from orbit. Made of ice.
p537
aVBut there was something bizarre about it.
p538
aVIf you look at these stripes in here, what we call tiger stripes,
p539
aVwhen we flew over them, all of a sudden we saw
p540
aVan increase in the temperature, which said that those stripes
p541
aVare warmer than the rest of the planet.
p542
aa(lp543
VSo as we flew by away from it, we looked back. And guess what?
p544
aVWe saw geysers coming out.
p545
aVSo this is a Yellowstone, you know, of Saturn.
p546
aVWe are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet,
p547
aVwhich indicate that most likely there is an ocean, you know,
p548
aVbelow the surface.
p549
aVAnd somehow, through some dynamic effect, we're having these geysers
p550
aVwhich are being, you know, emitted from it.
p551
aVAnd the reason I showed the little arrow there,
p552
aVI think that should say 30 miles,
p553
aVwe decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft
p554
aVthrough the plume of that geyser
p555
aVso we can actually measure the material that it is made of.
p556
aVThat was [unclear] also \u2014 you know, because we were worried
p557
aVabout the risk of it, but it worked pretty well.
p558
aVWe flew at the top of it, and we found that there is a fair amount of
p559
aVorganic material which is being emitted in combination with the ice.
p560
aVAnd over the next few years, as we keep orbiting, you know, Saturn,
p561
aVwe are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface
p562
aVand make more accurate measurements.
p563
aa(lp564
VNow, another satellite also attracted a lot of attention,
p565
aVand that's Titan. And the reason Titan is particularly interesting,
p566
aVit's a satellite bigger than our moon, and it has an atmosphere.
p567
aVAnd that atmosphere is very \u2014 as dense as our own atmosphere.
p568
aVSo if you were on Titan, you would feel the same pressure
p569
aVthat you feel in here. Except it's a lot colder,
p570
aVand that atmosphere is heavily made of methane.
p571
aVNow, methane gets people all excited, because it's organic material,
p572
aVso immediately people start thinking,
p573
aVcould life have evolved in that location,
p574
aVwhen you have a lot of organic material.
p575
aVSo people believe now that Titan is most likely what we call
p576
aVa pre-biotic planet, because it's so cold organic material did not get
p577
aVto the stage of becoming biological material,
p578
aVand therefore life could have evolved on it.
p579
aa(lp580
VSo it could be Earth, frozen three billion years ago
p581
aVbefore life actually started on it.
p582
aVSo that's getting a lot of interest, and to show you some example
p583
aVof what we did in there, we actually dropped a probe,
p584
aVwhich was developed by our colleagues in Europe, we dropped a probe
p585
aVas we were orbiting Saturn.
p586
aVWe dropped a probe in the atmosphere of Titan.
p587
aVAnd this is a picture of an area as we were coming down.
p588
aVJust looked like the coast of California for me.
p589
aVYou see the rivers which are coming along the coast,
p590
aVand you see that white area which looks like Catalina Island,
p591
aVand that looks like an ocean.
p592
aVAnd then with an instrument we have on board, a radar instrument,
p593
aVwe found there are lakes like the Great Lakes in here,
p594
aVso it looks very much like Earth.
p595
aVIt looks like there are rivers on it, there are oceans or lakes,
p596
aVwe know there are clouds. We think it's raining also on it.
p597
aVSo it's very much like the cycle on Earth except
p598
aVbecause it's so cold, it could not be water, you know,
p599
aVbecause water would have frozen.
p600
aVWhat it turned out, that all that we are seeing, all this liquid,
p601
aV[is made of] hydrocarbon and ethane and methane,
p602
aVsimilar to what you put in your car.
p603
aa(lp604
VSo here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our Earth,
p605
aVbut is all made of ethane and methane and organic material.
p606
aVSo if you were on Mars \u2014 sorry, on Titan,
p607
aVyou don't have to worry about four-dollar gasoline.
p608
aVYou just drive to the nearest lake, stick your hose in it,
p609
aVand you've got your car filled up.
p610
aVOn the other hand, if you light a match
p611
aVthe whole planet will blow up.
p612
aVSo in closing, I said I want to close by a couple of pictures.
p613
aVAnd just to kind of put us in perspective,
p614
aVthis is a picture of Saturn taken with a spacecraft
p615
aVfrom behind Saturn, looking towards the Sun.
p616
aVThe Sun is behind Saturn, so we see what we call "forward scattering,"
p617
aVso it highlights all the rings. And I'm going to zoom.
p618
aVThere is a \u2014 I'm not sure you can see it very well,
p619
aVbut on the top left, around 10 o'clock,
p620
aVthere is a little teeny dot, and that's Earth.
p621
aVYou barely can see ourselves. So what I did, I thought I'd zoom on it.
p622
aVSo as you zoom in, you know, you can see Earth, you know,
p623
aVjust in the middle here. So we zoomed all the way on the art center.
p624
aa(lp625
VSo thank you very much.
