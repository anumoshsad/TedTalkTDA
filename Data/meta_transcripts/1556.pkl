VI'd like to tell you about two games of chess.
p4
aVThe first happened in 1997, in which Garry Kasparov,
p5
aVa human, lost to Deep Blue, a machine.
p6
aVTo many, this was the dawn of a new era,
p7
aVone where man would be dominated by machine.
p8
aVBut here we are, 20 years on, and the greatest change
p9
aVin how we relate to computers is the iPad,
p10
aVnot HAL.
p11
aa(lp12
VThe second game was a freestyle chess tournament
p13
aVin 2005, in which man and machine could enter together
p14
aVas partners, rather than adversaries, if they so chose.
p15
aVAt first, the results were predictable.
p16
aVEven a supercomputer was beaten by a grandmaster
p17
aVwith a relatively weak laptop.
p18
aVThe surprise came at the end. Who won?
p19
aVNot a grandmaster with a supercomputer,
p20
aVbut actually two American amateurs
p21
aVusing three relatively weak laptops.
p22
aVTheir ability to coach and manipulate their computers
p23
aVto deeply explore specific positions
p24
aVeffectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge
p25
aVof the grandmasters and the superior computational power
p26
aVof other adversaries.
p27
aVThis is an astonishing result: average men,
p28
aVaverage machines beating the best man, the best machine.
p29
aVAnd anyways, isn't it supposed to be man versus machine?
p30
aVInstead, it's about cooperation, and the right type of cooperation.
p31
aa(lp32
VWe've been paying a lot of attention to Marvin Minsky's
p33
aVvision for artificial intelligence over the last 50 years.
p34
aVIt's a sexy vision, for sure. Many have embraced it.
p35
aVIt's become the dominant school of thought in computer science.
p36
aVBut as we enter the era of big data, of network systems,
p37
aVof open platforms, and embedded technology,
p38
aVI'd like to suggest it's time to reevaluate an alternative vision
p39
aVthat was actually developed around the same time.
p40
aVI'm talking about J.C.R. Licklider's human-computer symbiosis,
p41
aVperhaps better termed "intelligence augmentation," I.A.
p42
aa(lp43
VLicklider was a computer science titan who had a profound
p44
aVeffect on the development of technology and the Internet.
p45
aVHis vision was to enable man and machine to cooperate
p46
aVin making decisions, controlling complex situations
p47
aVwithout the inflexible dependence
p48
aVon predetermined programs.
p49
aVNote that word "cooperate."
p50
aVLicklider encourages us not to take a toaster
p51
aVand make it Data from "Star Trek,"
p52
aVbut to take a human and make her more capable.
p53
aVHumans are so amazing \u2014 how we think,
p54
aVour non-linear approaches, our creativity,
p55
aViterative hypotheses, all very difficult if possible at all
p56
aVfor computers to do.
p57
aVLicklider intuitively realized this, contemplating humans
p58
aVsetting the goals, formulating the hypotheses,
p59
aVdetermining the criteria, and performing the evaluation.
p60
aVOf course, in other ways, humans are so limited.
p61
aVWe're terrible at scale, computation and volume.
p62
aVWe require high-end talent management
p63
aVto keep the rock band together and playing.
p64
aVLicklider foresaw computers doing all the routinizable work
p65
aVthat was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making.
p66
aa(lp67
VSilently, without much fanfare,
p68
aVthis approach has been compiling victories beyond chess.
p69
aVProtein folding, a topic that shares the incredible expansiveness of chess \u2014
p70
aVthere are more ways of folding a protein than there are atoms in the universe.
p71
aVThis is a world-changing problem with huge implications
p72
aVfor our ability to understand and treat disease.
p73
aVAnd for this task, supercomputer field brute force simply isn't enough.
p74
aVFoldit, a game created by computer scientists,
p75
aVillustrates the value of the approach.
p76
aVNon-technical, non-biologist amateurs play a video game
p77
aVin which they visually rearrange the structure of the protein,
p78
aVallowing the computer to manage the atomic forces
p79
aVand interactions and identify structural issues.
p80
aVThis approach beat supercomputers 50 percent of the time
p81
aVand tied 30 percent of the time.
p82
aVFoldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery
p83
aVby deciphering the structure of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus.
p84
aVA protease that had eluded determination for over 10 years
p85
aVwas solved was by three players in a matter of days,
p86
aVperhaps the first major scientific advance
p87
aVto come from playing a video game.
p88
aa(lp89
VLast year, on the site of the Twin Towers,
p90
aVthe 9/11 memorial opened.
p91
aVIt displays the names of the thousands of victims
p92
aVusing a beautiful concept called "meaningful adjacency."
p93
aVIt places the names next to each other based on their
p94
aVrelationships to one another: friends, families, coworkers.
p95
aVWhen you put it all together, it's quite a computational
p96
aVchallenge: 3,500 victims, 1,800 adjacency requests,
p97
aVthe importance of the overall physical specifications
p98
aVand the final aesthetics.
p99
aVWhen first reported by the media, full credit for such a feat
p100
aVwas given to an algorithm from the New York City
p101
aVdesign firm Local Projects. The truth is a bit more nuanced.
p102
aVWhile an algorithm was used to develop the underlying framework,
p103
aVhumans used that framework to design the final result.
p104
aVSo in this case, a computer had evaluated millions
p105
aVof possible layouts, managed a complex relational system,
p106
aVand kept track of a very large set of measurements
p107
aVand variables, allowing the humans to focus
p108
aVon design and compositional choices.
p109
aVSo the more you look around you,
p110
aVthe more you see Licklider's vision everywhere.
p111
aVWhether it's augmented reality in your iPhone or GPS in your car,
p112
aVhuman-computer symbiosis is making us more capable.
p113
aa(lp114
VSo if you want to improve human-computer symbiosis,
p115
aVwhat can you do?
p116
aVYou can start by designing the human into the process.
p117
aVInstead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem,
p118
aVdesign the solution around what the human will do as well.
p119
aVWhen you do this, you'll quickly realize that you spent
p120
aVall of your time on the interface between man and machine,
p121
aVspecifically on designing away the friction in the interaction.
p122
aVIn fact, this friction is more important than the power
p123
aVof the man or the power of the machine
p124
aVin determining overall capability.
p125
aVThat's why two amateurs with a few laptops
p126
aVhandily beat a supercomputer and a grandmaster.
p127
aVWhat Kasparov calls process is a byproduct of friction.
p128
aVThe better the process, the less the friction.
p129
aVAnd minimizing friction turns out to be the decisive variable.
p130
aa(lp131
VOr take another example: big data.
p132
aVEvery interaction we have in the world is recorded
p133
aVby an ever growing array of sensors: your phone,
p134
aVyour credit card, your computer. The result is big data,
p135
aVand it actually presents us with an opportunity
p136
aVto more deeply understand the human condition.
p137
aVThe major emphasis of most approaches to big data
p138
aVfocus on, "How do I store this data? How do I search
p139
aVthis data? How do I process this data?"
p140
aVThese are necessary but insufficient questions.
p141
aVThe imperative is not to figure out how to compute,
p142
aVbut what to compute. How do you impose human intuition
p143
aVon data at this scale?
p144
aa(lp145
VAgain, we start by designing the human into the process.
p146
aVWhen PayPal was first starting as a business, their biggest
p147
aVchallenge was not, "How do I send money back and forth online?"
p148
aVIt was, "How do I do that without being defrauded by organized crime?"
p149
aVWhy so challenging? Because while computers can learn
p150
aVto detect and identify fraud based on patterns,
p151
aVthey can't learn to do that based on patterns
p152
aVthey've never seen before, and organized crime
p153
aVhas a lot in common with this audience: brilliant people,
p154
aVrelentlessly resourceful, entrepreneurial spirit \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p155
aVand one huge and important difference: purpose.
p156
aVAnd so while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest
p157
aVfraudsters, catching the cleverest is the difference
p158
aVbetween success and failure.
p159
aa(lp160
VThere's a whole class of problems like this, ones with
p161
aVadaptive adversaries. They rarely if ever present with a
p162
aVrepeatable pattern that's discernable to computers.
p163
aVInstead, there's some inherent component of innovation or disruption,
p164
aVand increasingly these problems are buried in big data.
p165
aa(lp166
VFor example, terrorism. Terrorists are always adapting
p167
aVin minor and major ways to new circumstances, and despite
p168
aVwhat you might see on TV, these adaptations,
p169
aVand the detection of them, are fundamentally human.
p170
aVComputers don't detect novel patterns and new behaviors,
p171
aVbut humans do. Humans, using technology, testing hypotheses,
p172
aVsearching for insight by asking machines to do things for them.
p173
aVOsama bin Laden was not caught by artificial intelligence.
p174
aVHe was caught by dedicated, resourceful, brilliant people
p175
aVin partnerships with various technologies.
p176
aa(lp177
VAs appealing as it might sound, you cannot algorithmically
p178
aVdata mine your way to the answer.
p179
aVThere is no "Find Terrorist" button, and the more data
p180
aVwe integrate from a vast variety of sources
p181
aVacross a wide variety of data formats from very
p182
aVdisparate systems, the less effective data mining can be.
p183
aVInstead, people will have to look at data
p184
aVand search for insight, and as Licklider foresaw long ago,
p185
aVthe key to great results here is the right type of cooperation,
p186
aVand as Kasparov realized,
p187
aVthat means minimizing friction at the interface.
p188
aa(lp189
VNow this approach makes possible things like combing
p190
aVthrough all available data from very different sources,
p191
aVidentifying key relationships and putting them in one place,
p192
aVsomething that's been nearly impossible to do before.
p193
aVTo some, this has terrifying privacy and civil liberties
p194
aVimplications. To others it foretells of an era of greater
p195
aVprivacy and civil liberties protections,
p196
aVbut privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance.
p197
aVThat must be acknowledged, and they can't be swept aside,
p198
aVeven with the best of intents.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo let's explore, through a couple of examples, the impact
p201
aVthat technologies built to drive human-computer symbiosis
p202
aVhave had in recent time.
p203
aa(lp204
VIn October, 2007, U.S. and coalition forces raided
p205
aVan al Qaeda safe house in the city of Sinjar
p206
aVon the Syrian border of Iraq.
p207
aVThey found a treasure trove of documents:
p208
aV700 biographical sketches of foreign fighters.
p209
aVThese foreign fighters had left their families in the Gulf,
p210
aVthe Levant and North Africa to join al Qaeda in Iraq.
p211
aVThese records were human resource forms.
p212
aVThe foreign fighters filled them out as they joined the organization.
p213
aVIt turns out that al Qaeda, too,
p214
aVis not without its bureaucracy. (Laughter)
p215
aVThey answered questions like, "Who recruited you?"
p216
aV"What's your hometown?" "What occupation do you seek?"
p217
aa(lp218
VIn that last question, a surprising insight was revealed.
p219
aVThe vast majority of foreign fighters
p220
aVwere seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom \u2014
p221
aVhugely important, since between 2003 and 2007, Iraq
p222
aVhad 1,382 suicide bombings, a major source of instability.
p223
aVAnalyzing this data was hard. The originals were sheets
p224
aVof paper in Arabic that had to be scanned and translated.
p225
aVThe friction in the process did not allow for meaningful
p226
aVresults in an operational time frame using humans, PDFs
p227
aVand tenacity alone.
p228
aVThe researchers had to lever up their human minds
p229
aVwith technology to dive deeper, to explore non-obvious
p230
aVhypotheses, and in fact, insights emerged.
p231
aVTwenty percent of the foreign fighters were from Libya,
p232
aV50 percent of those from a single town in Libya,
p233
aVhugely important since prior statistics put that figure at
p234
aVthree percent. It also helped to hone in on a figure
p235
aVof rising importance in al Qaeda, Abu Yahya al-Libi,
p236
aVa senior cleric in the Libyan Islamic fighting group.
p237
aVIn March of 2007, he gave a speech, after which there was
p238
aVa surge in participation amongst Libyan foreign fighters.
p239
aa(lp240
VPerhaps most clever of all, though, and least obvious,
p241
aVby flipping the data on its head, the researchers were
p242
aVable to deeply explore the coordination networks in Syria
p243
aVthat were ultimately responsible for receiving and
p244
aVtransporting the foreign fighters to the border.
p245
aVThese were networks of mercenaries, not ideologues,
p246
aVwho were in the coordination business for profit.
p247
aVFor example, they charged Saudi foreign fighters
p248
aVsubstantially more than Libyans, money that would have
p249
aVotherwise gone to al Qaeda.
p250
aVPerhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network
p251
aVif they knew they cheating would-be jihadists.
p252
aa(lp253
VIn January, 2010, a devastating 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti,
p254
aVthird deadliest earthquake of all time, left one million people,
p255
aV10 percent of the population, homeless.
p256
aVOne seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort
p257
aVbecame increasingly important as the delivery of food
p258
aVand water started rolling.
p259
aVJanuary and February are the dry months in Haiti,
p260
aVyet many of the camps had developed standing water.
p261
aVThe only institution with detailed knowledge of Haiti's
p262
aVfloodplains had been leveled
p263
aVin the earthquake, leadership inside.
p264
aVSo the question is, which camps are at risk,
p265
aVhow many people are in these camps, what's the
p266
aVtimeline for flooding, and given very limited resources
p267
aVand infrastructure, how do we prioritize the relocation?
p268
aVThe data was incredibly disparate. The U.S. Army had
p269
aVdetailed knowledge for only a small section of the country.
p270
aVThere was data online from a 2006 environmental risk
p271
aVconference, other geospatial data, none of it integrated.
p272
aVThe human goal here was to identify camps for relocation
p273
aVbased on priority need.
p274
aVThe computer had to integrate a vast amount of geospacial
p275
aVinformation, social media data and relief organization
p276
aVinformation to answer this question.
p277
aVBy implementing a superior process, what was otherwise
p278
aVa task for 40 people over three months became
p279
aVa simple job for three people in 40 hours,
p280
aa(lp281
Vall victories for human-computer symbiosis.
p282
aa(lp283
VWe're more than 50 years into Licklider's vision
p284
aVfor the future, and the data suggests that we should be
p285
aVquite excited about tackling this century's hardest problems,
p286
aVman and machine in cooperation together.
p287
aVThank you. (Applause)
