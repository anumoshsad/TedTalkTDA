VTwo years ago, I was invited as an artist
p4
aVto participate in an exhibition commemorating
p5
aV100 years of Islamic art in Europe.
p6
aVThe curator had only one condition:
p7
aVI had to use the Arabic script for my artwork.
p8
aVNow, as an artist, a woman, an Arab,
p9
aVor a human being living in the world in 2010,
p10
aVI only had one thing to say:
p11
aVI wanted to say no.
p12
aVAnd in Arabic, to say "no," we say "no,
p13
aVand a thousand times no."
p14
aa(lp15
VSo I decided to look for a thousand different noes.
p16
aVon everything ever produced
p17
aVunder Islamic or Arab patronage in the past 1,400 years,
p18
aVfrom Spain to the borders of China.
p19
aVI collected my findings in a book,
p20
aVplaced them chronologically, stating the name,
p21
aVthe patron, the medium and the date.
p22
aVNow, the book sat on a small shelf next to the installation,
p23
aVwhich stood three by seven meters, in Munich, Germany,
p24
aVin September of 2010.
p25
aa(lp26
VNow, in January, 2011, the revolution started,
p27
aVand life stopped for 18 days,
p28
aVand on the 12th of February,
p29
aVwe naively celebrated on the streets of Cairo,
p30
aVbelieving that the revolution had succeeded.
p31
aa(lp32
VNine months later I found myself spraying messages
p33
aVin Tahrir Square. The reason for this act
p34
aVwas this image that I saw in my newsfeed.
p35
aVI did not feel that I could live in a city
p36
aVwhere people were being killed
p37
aVand thrown like garbage on the street.
p38
aVSo I took one "no" off a tombstone from
p39
aVthe Islamic Museum in Cairo, and I added a message to it:
p40
aV"no to military rule."
p41
aVAnd I started spraying that on the streets in Cairo.
p42
aVBut that led to a series of no, coming out of the book
p43
aVlike ammunition, and adding messages to them,
p44
aVand I started spraying them on the walls.
p45
aVSo I'll be sharing some of these noes with you.
p46
aa(lp47
VNo to a new Pharaoh, because whoever comes next
p48
aVshould understand that we will never be ruled by another dictator.
p49
aa(lp50
VNo to violence: Ramy Essam came to Tahrir
p51
aVon the second day of the revolution,
p52
aVand he sat there with this guitar, singing.
p53
aVOne month after Mubarak stepped down, this was his reward.
p54
aa(lp55
VNo to blinding heroes. Ahmed Harara lost his right eye
p56
aVon the 28th of January,
p57
aVand he lost his left eye on the 19th of November,
p58
aVby two different snipers.
p59
aa(lp60
VNo to killing, in this case no to killing men of religion,
p61
aVbecause Sheikh Ahmed Adina Refaat was shot
p62
aVon December 16th, during a demonstration,
p63
aVleaving behind three orphans and a widow.
p64
aa(lp65
VNo to burning books. The Institute of Egypt was burned
p66
aVon December 17th, a huge cultural loss.
p67
aa(lp68
VNo to stripping the people,
p69
aVand the blue bra is to remind us of our shame
p70
aVas a nation when we allow a veiled woman to be stripped
p71
aVand beaten on the street, and the footprint reads,
p72
aV"Long live a peaceful revolution,"
p73
aVbecause we will never retaliate with violence.
p74
aa(lp75
VNo to barrier walls. On February 5th,
p76
aVconcrete roadblocks were set up in Cairo
p77
aVto protect the Ministry of Defense from protesters.
p78
aa(lp79
VNow, speaking of walls, I want to share with you the story
p80
aVof one wall in Cairo.
p81
aVA group of artists decided to paint a life-size tank
p82
aVon a wall. It's one to one.
p83
aVIn front of this tank there's a man on a bicycle
p84
aVwith a breadbasket on his head. To any passerby,
p85
aVthere's no problem with this visual.
p86
aVAfter acts of violence, another artist came,
p87
aVpainted blood, protesters being run over by the tank,
p88
aVdemonstrators, and a message that read,
p89
aV"Starting tomorrow, I wear the new face,
p90
aVthe face of every martyr. I exist."
p91
aVAuthority comes, paints the wall white,
p92
aVleaves the tank and adds a message:
p93
aV"Army and people, one hand. Egypt for Egyptians."
p94
aVAnother artist comes, paints the head of the military
p95
aVas a monster eating a maiden in a river of blood
p96
aVin front of the tank.
p97
aVAuthority comes, paints the wall white, leaves the tank,
p98
aVleaves the suit, and throws a bucket of black paint
p99
aVjust to hide the face of the monster.
p100
aVSo I come with my stencils, and I spray them on the suit,
p101
aVon the tank, and on the whole wall,
p102
aVand this is how it stands today
p103
aVuntil further notice. (Laughter)
p104
aa(lp105
VNow, I want to leave you with a final no.
p106
aVI found Neruda scribbled on a piece of paper
p107
aVin a field hospital in Tahrir, and I decided to take a no of
p108
aVMamluk Mausoleum in Cairo.
p109
aVThe message reads,
p110
aV[Arabic]
p111
aV"You can crush the flowers, but you can't delay spring."
p112
aa(lp113
VThank you. (Applause)
p114
aV(Applause)
p115
aVThank you. Shukran. (Applause)
