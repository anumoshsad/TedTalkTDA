VI want to share with you something my father taught me:
p4
aVno condition is permanent.
p5
aVIt's a lesson he shared with me again and again,
p6
aVand I learned it to be true the hard way.
p7
aa(lp8
VHere I am in my fourth-grade class.
p9
aVThis is my yearbook picture taken in my class in school
p10
aVin Monrovia, Liberia.
p11
aVMy parents migrated from India to West Africa in the 1970s,
p12
aVand I had the privilege of growing up there.
p13
aVI was nine years old,
p14
aVI loved kicking around a soccer ball,
p15
aVand I was a total math and science geek.
p16
aVI was living the kind of life that, really, any child would dream of.
p17
aVBut no condition is permanent.
p18
aa(lp19
VOn Christmas Eve in 1989,
p20
aVcivil war erupted in Liberia.
p21
aVThe war started in the rural countryside,
p22
aVand within months, rebel armies had marched towards our hometown.
p23
aVMy school shut down,
p24
aVand when the rebel armies captured the only international airport,
p25
aVpeople started panicking and fleeing.
p26
aVMy mom came knocking one morning and said, "Raj, pack your things \u2014
p27
aVwe have to go."
p28
aVWe were rushed to the center of town,
p29
aVand there on a tarmac, we were split into two lines.
p30
aVI stood with my family in one line,
p31
aVand we were stuffed into the cargo hatch
p32
aVof a rescue plane.
p33
aVAnd there on a bench, I was sitting with my heart racing.
p34
aVAs I looked out the open hatch,
p35
aVI saw hundreds of Liberians in another line,
p36
aVchildren strapped to their backs.
p37
aVWhen they tried to jump in with us,
p38
aVI watched soldiers restrain them.
p39
aVThey were not allowed to flee.
p40
aa(lp41
VWe were the lucky ones.
p42
aVWe lost what we had,
p43
aVbut we resettled in America,
p44
aVand as immigrants, we benefitted from the community of supporters
p45
aVthat rallied around us.
p46
aVThey took my family into their home,
p47
aVthey mentored me.
p48
aVAnd they helped my dad start a clothing shop.
p49
aVI'd visit my father on weekends as a teenager
p50
aVto help him sell sneakers and jeans.
p51
aVAnd every time business would get bad,
p52
aVhe'd remind me of that mantra:
p53
aVno condition is permanent.
p54
aVThat mantra and my parents' persistence and that community of supporters
p55
aVmade it possible for me to go through college
p56
aVand eventually to medical school.
p57
aVI'd once had my hopes crushed in a war,
p58
aVbut because of them,
p59
aVI had a chance to pursue my dream to become a doctor.
p60
aVMy condition had changed.
p61
aa(lp62
VIt had been 15 years since I escaped that airfield,
p63
aVbut the memory of those two lines had not escaped my mind.
p64
aVI was a medical student in my mid-20s,
p65
aVand I wanted to go back
p66
aVto see if I could serve the people we'd left behind.
p67
aVBut when I got back,
p68
aVwhat I found was utter destruction.
p69
aVThe war had left us with just 51 doctors
p70
aVto serve a country of four million people.
p71
aVIt would be like the city of San Francisco having just 10 doctors.
p72
aVSo if you got sick in the city where those few doctors remain,
p73
aVyou might stand a chance.
p74
aVBut if you got sick in the remote, rural rainforest communities,
p75
aVwhere you could be days from the nearest clinic \u2014
p76
aVI was seeing my patients die from conditions no one should die from,
p77
aVall because they were getting to me too late.
p78
aVImagine you have a two-year-old who wakes up one morning with a fever,
p79
aVand you realize she could have malaria,
p80
aVand you know the only way to get her the medicine she needs
p81
aVwould be to take her to the riverbed,
p82
aVget in a canoe, paddle to the other side
p83
aVand then walk for up to two days through the forest
p84
aVjust to reach the nearest clinic.
p85
aa(lp86
VOne billion people live in the world's most remote communities,
p87
aVand despite the advances we've made in modern medicine and technology,
p88
aVour innovations are not reaching the last mile.
p89
aVThese communities have been left behind,
p90
aVbecause they've been thought too hard to reach
p91
aVand too difficult to serve.
p92
aVIllness is universal;
p93
aVaccess to care is not.
p94
aVAnd realizing this lit a fire in my soul.
p95
aVNo one should die because they live too far from a doctor or clinic.
p96
aVNo condition should be permanent.
p97
aVAnd help in this case didn't come from the outside,
p98
aVit actually came from within.
p99
aVIt came from the communities themselves.
p100
aa(lp101
VMeet Musu.
p102
aVWay out in rural Liberia,
p103
aVwhere most girls have not had a chance to finish primary school,
p104
aVMusu had been persistent.
p105
aVAt the age of 18, she completed high school,
p106
aVand she came back to her community.
p107
aVShe saw that none of the children were getting treatment
p108
aVfor the diseases they needed treatment for \u2014
p109
aVdeadly diseases, like malaria and pneumonia.
p110
aVSo she signed up to be a volunteer.
p111
aVThere are millions of volunteers like Musu in rural parts around our world,
p112
aVand we got to thinking \u2014
p113
aVcommunity members like Musu could actually help us solve a puzzle.
p114
aa(lp115
VOur health care system is structured in such a way
p116
aVthat the work of diagnosing disease and prescribing medicines
p117
aVis limited to a team of nurses and doctors like me.
p118
aVBut nurses and doctors are concentrated in cities,
p119
aVso rural communities like Musu's have been left behind.
p120
aa(lp121
VSo we started asking some questions:
p122
aVWhat if we could reorganize the medical care system?
p123
aVWhat if we could have community members like Musu
p124
aVbe a part or even be the center of our medical team?
p125
aVWhat if Musu could help us bring health care from clinics in cities
p126
aVto the doorsteps of her neighbors?
p127
aVMusu was 48 when I met her.
p128
aVAnd despite her amazing talent and grit,
p129
aVshe hadn't had a paying job in 30 years.
p130
aVSo what if technology could support her?
p131
aVWhat if we could invest in her with real training,
p132
aVequip her with real medicines,
p133
aVand have her have a real job?
p134
aa(lp135
VWell, in 2007, I was trying to answer these questions,
p136
aVand my wife and I were getting married that year.
p137
aVWe asked our relatives to forgo the wedding registry gifts
p138
aVand instead donate some money
p139
aVso we could have some start-up money to launch a nonprofit.
p140
aVI promise you, I'm a lot more romantic than that.
p141
aa(lp142
V(Laughter)
p143
aa(lp144
VWe ended up raising $6,000,
p145
aVteamed up with some Liberians and Americans
p146
aVand launched a nonprofit called Last Mile Health.
p147
aVOur goal is to bring a health worker within reach of everyone, everywhere.
p148
aVWe designed a three-step process \u2014
p149
aVtrain, equip and pay \u2014
p150
aVto invest more deeply in volunteers like Musu
p151
aVto become paraprofessionals,
p152
aVto become community health workers.
p153
aa(lp154
VFirst we trained Musu to prevent, diagnose and treat
p155
aVthe top 10 diseases afflicting families in her village.
p156
aVA nurse supervisor visited her every month to coach her.
p157
aVWe equipped her with modern medical technology,
p158
aVlike this $1 malaria rapid test,
p159
aVand put it in a backpack full of medicines like this
p160
aVto treat infections like pneumonia,
p161
aVand crucially,
p162
aVa smartphone, to help her track and report on epidemics.
p163
aVLast, we recognized the dignity in Musu's work.
p164
aVWith the Liberian government, we created a contract,
p165
aVpaid her
p166
aVand gave her the chance to have a real job.
p167
aVAnd she's amazing.
p168
aa(lp169
VMusu has learned over 30 medical skills,
p170
aVfrom screening children for malnutrition,
p171
aVto assessing the cause of a child's cough with a smartphone,
p172
aVto supporting people with HIV
p173
aVand providing follow-up care to patients who've lost their limbs.
p174
aVWorking as part of our team,
p175
aVworking as paraprofessionals,
p176
aVcommunity health workers can help ensure
p177
aVthat a lot of what your family doctor would do
p178
aVreaches the places that most family doctors could never go.
p179
aa(lp180
VOne of my favorite things to do is to care for patients
p181
aVwith community health workers.
p182
aVSo last year I was visiting A.B.,
p183
aVand like Musu, A.B. had had a chance to go to school.
p184
aVHe was in middle school, in the eighth grade,
p185
aVwhen his parents died.
p186
aVHe became an orphan and had to drop out.
p187
aVLast year, we hired and trained A.B. as a community health worker.
p188
aVAnd while he was making door to door house calls,
p189
aVhe met this young boy named Prince,
p190
aVwhose mother had had trouble breastfeeding him,
p191
aVand by the age of six months, Prince had started to waste away.
p192
aVA.B. had just been taught how to use this color-coded measuring tape
p193
aVthat wraps around the upper arm of a child to diagnose malnutrition.
p194
aVA.B. noticed that Prince was in the red zone,
p195
aVwhich meant he had to be hospitalized.
p196
aa(lp197
VSo A.B. took Prince and his mother to the river,
p198
aVgot in a canoe
p199
aVand paddled for four hours to get to the hospital.
p200
aVLater, after Prince was discharged,
p201
aVA.B. taught mom how to feed baby a food supplement.
p202
aVA few months ago,
p203
aVA.B. took me to visit Prince, and he's a chubby little guy.
p204
aa(lp205
V(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VHe's meeting his milestones, he's pulled himself up to a stand,
p208
aVand is even starting to say a few words.
p209
aVI'm so inspired by these community health workers.
p210
aVI often ask them why they do what they do,
p211
aVand when I asked A.B.,
p212
aVhe said, "Doc, since I dropped out of school, this is the first time
p213
aVI'm having a chance to hold a pen to write.
p214
aVMy brain is getting fresh."
p215
aa(lp216
VThe stories of A.B. and Musu have taught me something fundamental
p217
aVabout being human.
p218
aVOur will to serve others
p219
aVcan actually help us transform our own conditions.
p220
aVI was so moved by how powerful the will to serve our neighbors can be
p221
aVa few years ago,
p222
aVwhen we faced a global catastrophe.
p223
aa(lp224
VIn December 2013,
p225
aVsomething happened in the rainforests across the border from us in Guinea.
p226
aVA toddler named Emile fell sick with vomiting, fever and diarrhea.
p227
aVHe lived in an area where the roads were sparse
p228
aVand there had been massive shortages of health workers.
p229
aVEmile died,
p230
aVand a few weeks later his sister died,
p231
aVand a few weeks later his mother died.
p232
aVAnd this disease would spread from one community to another.
p233
aVAnd it wasn't until three months later
p234
aVthat the world recognized this as Ebola.
p235
aVWhen every minute counted, we had already lost months,
p236
aVand by then the virus had spread like wildfire all across West Africa,
p237
aVand eventually to other parts of the world.
p238
aVBusinesses shut down, airlines started canceling routes.
p239
aa(lp240
VAt the height of the crisis,
p241
aVwhen we were told that 1.4 million people could be infected,
p242
aVwhen we were told that most of them would die,
p243
aVwhen we had nearly lost all hope,
p244
aVI remember standing with a group of health workers
p245
aVin the rainforest where an outbreak had just happened.
p246
aVWe were helping train and equip them to put on the masks,
p247
aVthe gloves and the gowns that they needed
p248
aVto keep themselves safe from the virus
p249
aVwhile they were serving their patients.
p250
aVI remember the fear in their eyes.
p251
aVAnd I remember staying up at night, terrified if I'd made the right call
p252
aVto keep them in the field.
p253
aa(lp254
VWhen Ebola threatened to bring humanity to its knees,
p255
aVLiberia's community health workers didn't surrender to fear.
p256
aVThey did what they had always done:
p257
aVthey answered the call to serve their neighbors.
p258
aVCommunity members across Liberia learned the symptoms of Ebola,
p259
aVteamed up with nurses and doctors to go door-to-door to find the sick
p260
aVand get them into care.
p261
aVThey tracked thousands of people who had been exposed to the virus
p262
aVand helped break the chain of transmission.
p263
aVSome ten thousand community health workers risked their own lives
p264
aVto help hunt down this virus and stop it in its tracks.
p265
aa(lp266
V(Applause)
p267
aa(lp268
VToday, Ebola has come under control in West Africa,
p269
aVand we've learned a few things.
p270
aVWe've learned that blind spots in rural health care
p271
aVcan lead to hot spots of disease,
p272
aVand that places all of us at greater risk.
p273
aVWe've learned that the most efficient emergency system
p274
aVis actually an everyday system,
p275
aVand that system has to reach all communities,
p276
aVincluding rural communities like Emile's.
p277
aVAnd most of all,
p278
aVwe've learned from the courage of Liberia's community health workers
p279
aVthat we as people are not defined by the conditions we face,
p280
aVno matter how hopeless they seem.
p281
aVWe're defined by how we respond to them.
p282
aa(lp283
VFor the past 15 years,
p284
aVI've seen the power of this idea
p285
aVto transform everyday citizens into community health workers \u2014
p286
aVinto everyday heroes.
p287
aVAnd I've seen it play out everywhere,
p288
aVfrom the forest communities of West Africa,
p289
aVto the rural fishing villages of Alaska.
p290
aVIt's true,
p291
aVthese community health workers aren't doing neurosurgery,
p292
aVbut they're making it possible
p293
aVto bring health care within reach of everyone everywhere.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo now what?
p296
aVWell, we know that there are still millions of people dying
p297
aVfrom preventable causes
p298
aVin rural communities around the world.
p299
aVAnd we know that the great majority of these deaths are happening
p300
aVin these 75 blue-shaded countries.
p301
aVWhat we also know
p302
aVis that if we trained an army of community health workers
p303
aVto learn even just 30 lifesaving skills,
p304
aVwe could save the lives of nearly 30 million people by 2030.
p305
aVThirty services could save 30 million lives by 2030.
p306
aVThat's not just a blueprint \u2014
p307
aVwe're proving this can be done.
p308
aa(lp309
VIn Liberia,
p310
aVthe Liberian government is training thousands of workers like A.B. and Musu
p311
aVafter Ebola,
p312
aVto bring health care to every child and family in the country.
p313
aVAnd we've been honored to work with them,
p314
aVand are now teaming up with a number of organizations
p315
aVthat are working across other countries
p316
aVto try to help them do the same thing.
p317
aVIf we could help these countries scale,
p318
aVwe could save millions of lives,
p319
aVand at the same time,
p320
aVwe could create millions of jobs.
p321
aa(lp322
VWe simply can't do that, though, without technology.
p323
aVPeople are worried that technology is going to steal our jobs,
p324
aVbut when it comes to community health workers,
p325
aVtechnology has actually been vital for creating jobs.
p326
aVWithout technology \u2014 without this smartphone,
p327
aVwithout this rapid test \u2014
p328
aVit would have been impossible for us to be able to employ A.B. and Musu.
p329
aVAnd I think it's time for technology to help us train,
p330
aVto help us train people faster and better than ever before.
p331
aa(lp332
VAs a doctor,
p333
aVI use technology to stay up-to-date and keep certified.
p334
aVI use smartphones, I use apps, I use online courses.
p335
aVBut when A.B. wants to learn,
p336
aVhe's got to jump back in that canoe
p337
aVand get to the training center.
p338
aVAnd when Musu shows up for training,
p339
aVher instructors are stuck using flip charts and markers.
p340
aVWhy shouldn't they have the same access to learn as I do?
p341
aVIf we truly want community health workers to master those lifesaving skills
p342
aVand even more,
p343
aVwe've got to change this old-school model of education.
p344
aVTech can truly be a game changer here.
p345
aVI've been in awe of the digital education revolution
p346
aVthat the likes of Khan Academy and edX have been leading.
p347
aVAnd I've been thinking that it's time;
p348
aVit's time for a collision
p349
aVbetween the digital education revolution
p350
aVand the community health revolution.
p351
aa(lp352
VAnd so, this brings me to my TED Prize wish.
p353
aVI wish \u2014
p354
aVI wish that you would help us recruit
p355
aVthe largest army of community health workers the world has ever known
p356
aVby creating the Community Health Academy,
p357
aVa global platform to train, connect and empower.
p358
aa(lp359
V(Applause)
p360
aa(lp361
VThank you.
p362
aa(lp363
V(Applause)
p364
aa(lp365
VThank you.
p366
aa(lp367
VHere's the idea:
p368
aVwe'll create and curate
p369
aVthe best in digital education resources.
p370
aVWe will bring those to community health workers around the world,
p371
aVincluding A.B. and Musu.
p372
aVThey'll get video lessons on giving kids vaccines
p373
aVand have online courses on spotting the next outbreak,
p374
aVso they're not stuck using flip charts.
p375
aVWe'll help these countries accredit these workers,
p376
aVso that they're not stuck remaining an under-recognized, undervalued group,
p377
aVbut become a renowned, empowered profession,
p378
aVjust like nurses and doctors.
p379
aa(lp380
VAnd we'll create a network of companies and entrepreneurs
p381
aVwho've created innovations that can save lives
p382
aVand help them connect to workers like Musu,
p383
aVso she can help better serve her community.
p384
aVAnd we'll work tirelessly to persuade governments
p385
aVto make community health workers a cornerstone of their health care plans.
p386
aVWe plan to test and prototype the academy in Liberia
p387
aVand a few other partner countries,
p388
aVand then we plan to take it global,
p389
aVincluding to rural North America.
p390
aVWith the power of this platform,
p391
aVwe believe countries can be more persuaded
p392
aVthat a health care revolution really is possible.
p393
aa(lp394
VMy dream is that this academy will contribute to the training
p395
aVof hundreds of thousands of community members
p396
aVto help bring health care to their neighbors \u2014
p397
aVthe hundreds of millions of them
p398
aVthat live in the world's most remote communities,
p399
aVfrom the forest communities of West Africa,
p400
aVto the fishing villages of rural Alaska;
p401
aVfrom the hilltops of Appalachia, to the mountains of Afghanistan.
p402
aVIf this vision is aligned with yours,
p403
aVhead to communityhealthacademy.org,
p404
aVand join this revolution.
p405
aVLet us know if you or your organization or someone you know could help us
p406
aVas we try to build this academy over the next year.
p407
aa(lp408
VNow, as I look out into this room,
p409
aVI realize that our journeys are not self-made;
p410
aVthey're shaped by others.
p411
aVAnd there have been so many here that have been part of this cause.
p412
aVWe're so honored to be part of this community,
p413
aVand a community that's willing to take on a cause
p414
aVas audacious as this one,
p415
aVso I wanted to offer, as I end,
p416
aVa reflection.
p417
aa(lp418
VI think a lot more about what my father taught me.
p419
aVThese days, I too have become a dad.
p420
aVI have two sons,
p421
aVand my wife and I just learned that she's pregnant with our third child.
p422
aa(lp423
V(Applause)
p424
aa(lp425
VThank you.
p426
aa(lp427
V(Applause)
p428
aa(lp429
VI was recently caring for a woman in Liberia
p430
aVwho, like my wife, was in her third pregnancy.
p431
aVBut unlike my wife,
p432
aVhad had no prenatal care with her first two babies.
p433
aVShe lived in an isolated community in the forest that had gone for 100 years
p434
aVwithout any health care
p435
aVuntil ...
p436
aVuntil last year when a nurse trained her neighbors
p437
aVto become community health workers.
p438
aa(lp439
VSo here I was,
p440
aVseeing this patient who was in her second trimester,
p441
aVand I pulled out the ultrasound to check on the baby,
p442
aVand she started telling us stories about her first two kids,
p443
aVand I had the ultrasound probe on her belly,
p444
aVand she just stopped mid-sentence.
p445
aVShe turned to me and she said,
p446
aV"Doc, what's that sound?"
p447
aVIt was the first time she'd ever heard her baby's heartbeat.
p448
aVAnd her eyes lit up in the same way my wife's eyes and my own eyes lit up
p449
aVwhen we heard our baby's heartbeat.
p450
aa(lp451
VFor all of human history,
p452
aVillness has been universal and access to care has not.
p453
aVBut as a wise man once told me:
p454
aVno condition is permanent.
p455
aVIt's time.
p456
aVIt's time for us to go as far as it takes
p457
aVto change this condition together.
