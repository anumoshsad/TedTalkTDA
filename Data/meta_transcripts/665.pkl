VThe future, as we know it, is very unpredictable.
p4
aVThe best minds in the best institutions
p5
aVgenerally get it wrong.
p6
aVThis is in technology. This is in the area of politics,
p7
aVwhere pundits, the CIA, MI6 always get it wrong.
p8
aVAnd it's clearly in the area of finance.
p9
aVWith institutions established to think about the future,
p10
aVthe IMF, the BIS, the Financial Stability Forum, couldn't see what was coming.
p11
aVOver 20,000 economists
p12
aVwhose job it is, competitive entry to get there,
p13
aVcouldn't see what was happening.
p14
aa(lp15
VGlobalization is getting more complex.
p16
aVAnd this change is getting more rapid.
p17
aVThe future will be more unpredictable.
p18
aVUrbanization, integration,
p19
aVcoming together, leads to a new renaissance.
p20
aVIt did this a thousand years ago.
p21
aVThe last 40 years have been extraordinary times.
p22
aVLife expectancy has gone up by about 25 years.
p23
aVIt took from the Stone Age to achieve that.
p24
aVIncome has gone up for a majority of the world's population,
p25
aVdespite the population going up by about two billion people over this period.
p26
aVAnd illiteracy has gone down, from a half to about a quarter of the people on Earth.
p27
aVA huge opportunity, unleashing of new potential
p28
aVfor innovation, for development.
p29
aa(lp30
VBut there is an underbelly.
p31
aVThere are two Achilles' heels of globalization.
p32
aVThere is the Achilles' heel of growing inequality \u2014
p33
aVthose that are left out, those that feel angry,
p34
aVthose that are not participating. Globalization
p35
aVhas not been inclusive.
p36
aVThe second Achilles' heel is complexity \u2014
p37
aVa growing fragility, a growing brittleness.
p38
aVWhat happens in one place very quickly affects everything else.
p39
aVThis is a systemic risk, systemic shock.
p40
aVWe've seen it in the financial crisis. We've seen it in the pandemic flu.
p41
aVIt will become virulent and it's something we have to build resilience against.
p42
aa(lp43
VA lot of this is driven by what's happening in technology.
p44
aVThere have been huge leaps. There will be a million-fold improvement
p45
aVin what you can get for the same price
p46
aVin computing by 2030.
p47
aVThat's what the experience of the last 20 years has been.
p48
aVIt will continue.
p49
aVOur computers, our systems will be as primitive
p50
aVas the Apollo's are for today.
p51
aVOur mobile phones are more powerful than the total Apollo space engine.
p52
aVOur mobile phones are more powerful than
p53
aVsome of the strongest computers of 20 years ago.
p54
aVSo what will this do?
p55
aVIt will create huge opportunities in technology.
p56
aVMiniaturization as well.
p57
aVThere will be invisible capacity. Invisible capacity in our bodies,
p58
aVin our brains, and in the air.
p59
aVThis is a dust mite on a nanoreplica.
p60
aa(lp61
VThis sort of ability to do everything in new ways unleashes potential,
p62
aVnot least in the area of medicine.
p63
aVThis is a stem cell that we've developed here in Oxford,
p64
aVfrom an embryonic stem cell.
p65
aVWe can develop any part of the body.
p66
aVIncreasingly, over time, this will be possible from our own skin \u2014
p67
aVable to replicate parts of the body.
p68
aVFantastic potential for regenerative medicine.
p69
aVI don't think there will be a Special Olympics long after 2030,
p70
aVbecause of this capacity to regenerate parts of the body.
p71
aVBut the question is, "Who will have it?"
p72
aa(lp73
VThe other major development is going to be
p74
aVin the area of what can happen in genetics.
p75
aVThe capacity to create, as this mouse has been genetically modified,
p76
aVsomething which goes three times faster,
p77
aVlasts for three times longer, we could produce,
p78
aVas this mouse can, to the age of our equivalent of 80 years,
p79
aVusing about the same amount of food.
p80
aVBut will this only be available for the super rich,
p81
aVfor those that can afford it? Are we headed for a new eugenics?
p82
aVWill only those that are able to afford it
p83
aVbe able to be this super race of the future?
p84
aV(Laughter)
p85
aa(lp86
VSo the big question for us is,
p87
aV"How do we manage this technological change?"
p88
aVHow do we ensure that it creates
p89
aVa more inclusive technology,
p90
aVa technology which means
p91
aVthat not only as we grow older,
p92
aVthat we can also grow wiser, and that we're able to support
p93
aVthe populations of the future?
p94
aVOne of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements
p95
aVwill be moving from population pyramids
p96
aVto what we might term population coffins.
p97
aVThere is unlikely to be a pension
p98
aVor a retirement age in 2030.
p99
aVThese will be redundant concepts. And this isn't only something of the West.
p100
aa(lp101
VThe most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper
p102
aVtype of new pyramids
p103
aVthat will take place in China and in many other countries.
p104
aVSo forget about retirements if you're young.
p105
aVForget about pensions. Think about life and where it's going to be going.
p106
aVOf course, migration will become even more important.
p107
aVThe war on talent, the need to attract people
p108
aVat all skill ranges,
p109
aVto push us around in our wheelchairs,
p110
aVbut also to drive our economies. Our innovation will be vital.
p111
aa(lp112
VThe employment in the rich countries
p113
aVwill go down from about 800
p114
aVto about 700 million of these people.
p115
aVThis would imply a massive leap in migration.
p116
aVSo the concerns, the xenophobic concerns of today,
p117
aVof migration, will be turned on their head,
p118
aVas we search for people to help us sort out
p119
aVour pensions and our economies in the future.
p120
aVAnd then, the systemic risks.
p121
aVWe understand that these will become much more virulent,
p122
aVthat what we see today
p123
aVis this interweaving of societies, of systems,
p124
aVfastened by technologies and hastened by just-in-time management systems.
p125
aVSmall levels of stock push resilience into other people's responsibility.
p126
aa(lp127
VThe collapse in biodiversity,
p128
aVclimate change, pandemics, financial crises:
p129
aVthese will be the currency that we will think about.
p130
aVAnd so a new awareness will have to arise,
p131
aVof how we deal with these, how we mobilize ourselves,
p132
aVin a new way, and come together as a community
p133
aVto manage systemic risk.
p134
aVIt's going to require innovation.
p135
aVIt's going to require an understanding that the glory of globalization
p136
aVcould also be its downfall.
p137
aVThis could be our best century ever because of the achievements,
p138
aVor it could be our worst.
p139
aVAnd of course we need to worry about the individuals,
p140
aVparticularly the individuals that feel that they've
p141
aVbeen left out in one way or another.
p142
aa(lp143
VAn individual, for the first time in the history of humanity,
p144
aVwill have the capacity, by 2030,
p145
aVto destroy the planet, to wreck everything,
p146
aVthrough the creation, for example, of a biopathogen.
p147
aVHow do we begin to weave these tapestries together?
p148
aVHow do we think about complex systems in new ways?
p149
aVThat will be the challenge of the scholars,
p150
aVand of all of us engaged in thinking about the future.
p151
aVThe rest of our lives will be in the future. We need to prepare for it now.
p152
aVWe need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized.
p153
aVIt cannot begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring.
p154
aVWe have to develop a new way of managing the planet,
p155
aVcollectively, through collective wisdom.
p156
aa(lp157
VWe know, and I know from my own experience,
p158
aVthat amazing things can happen,
p159
aVwhen individuals and societies come together
p160
aVto change their future.
p161
aVI left South Africa, and 15 years later,
p162
aVafter thinking I would never go back,
p163
aVI had the privilege and the honor to work in the government of Nelson Mandela.
p164
aVThis was a miracle. We can create miracles,
p165
aVcollectively, in our lifetime.
p166
aVIt is vital that we do so.
p167
aVIt is vital that the ideas that are nurtured in TED,
p168
aVthat the ideas that we think about
p169
aVlook forward, and make sure that this will be the most glorious century,
p170
aVand not one of eco-disaster and eco-collapse.
p171
aVThank you. (Applause)
