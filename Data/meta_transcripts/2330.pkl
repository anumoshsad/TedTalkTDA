VI published this article
p4
aVin the New York Times Modern Love column in January of this year.
p5
aV"To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This."
p6
aVAnd the article is about a psychological study
p7
aVdesigned to create romantic love in the laboratory,
p8
aVand my own experience trying the study myself
p9
aVone night last summer.
p10
aa(lp11
VSo the procedure is fairly simple:
p12
aVtwo strangers take turns asking each other 36 increasingly personal questions
p13
aVand then they stare into each other's eyes
p14
aVwithout speaking for four minutes.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo here are a couple of sample questions.
p17
aa(lp18
VNumber 12: If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability,
p19
aVwhat would it be?
p20
aa(lp21
VNumber 28: When did you last cry in front of another person?
p22
aVBy yourself?
p23
aa(lp24
VAs you can see, they really do get more personal as they go along.
p25
aa(lp26
VNumber 30, I really like this one:
p27
aVTell your partner what you like about them;
p28
aVbe very honest this time,
p29
aVsaying things you might not say to someone you just met.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo when I first came across this study a few years earlier,
p32
aVone detail really stuck out to me,
p33
aVand that was the rumor that two of the participants
p34
aVhad gotten married six months later,
p35
aVand they'd invited the entire lab to the ceremony.
p36
aVSo I was of course very skeptical
p37
aVabout this process of just manufacturing romantic love,
p38
aVbut of course I was intrigued.
p39
aVAnd when I got the chance to try this study myself,
p40
aVwith someone I knew but not particularly well,
p41
aVI wasn't expecting to fall in love.
p42
aVBut then we did, and \u2014
p43
aa(lp44
V(Laughter)
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd I thought it made a good story, so I sent it to the Modern Love column
p47
aVa few months later.
p48
aa(lp49
VNow, this was published in January,
p50
aVand now it is August,
p51
aVso I'm guessing that some of you are probably wondering,
p52
aVare we still together?
p53
aVAnd the reason I think you might be wondering this
p54
aVis because I have been asked this question
p55
aVagain and again and again for the past seven months.
p56
aVAnd this question is really what I want to talk about today.
p57
aVBut let's come back to it.
p58
aa(lp59
V(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VSo the week before the article came out,
p62
aVI was very nervous.
p63
aVI had been working on a book about love stories
p64
aVfor the past few years,
p65
aVso I had gotten used to writing about my own experiences
p66
aVwith romantic love on my blog.
p67
aVBut a blog post might get a couple hundred views at the most,
p68
aVand those were usually just my Facebook friends,
p69
aVand I figured my article in the New York Times
p70
aVwould probably get a few thousand views.
p71
aVAnd that felt like a lot of attention
p72
aVon a relatively new relationship.
p73
aVBut as it turned out, I had no idea.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo the article was published online
p76
aVon a Friday evening,
p77
aVand by Saturday, this had happened to the traffic on my blog.
p78
aVAnd by Sunday, both the Today Show and Good Morning America had called.
p79
aVWithin a month, the article would receive over 8 million views,
p80
aVand I was, to say the least,
p81
aVunderprepared for this sort of attention.
p82
aVIt's one thing to work up the confidence to write honestly
p83
aVabout your experiences with love,
p84
aVbut it is another thing to discover
p85
aVthat your love life has made international news \u2014
p86
aa(lp87
V(Laughter)
p88
aa(lp89
Vand to realize that people across the world
p90
aVare genuinely invested in the status of your new relationship.
p91
aa(lp92
V(Laughter)
p93
aa(lp94
VAnd when people called or emailed, which they did every day for weeks,
p95
aVthey always asked the same question first:
p96
aVare you guys still together?
p97
aVIn fact, as I was preparing this talk,
p98
aVI did a quick search of my email inbox
p99
aVfor the phrase "Are you still together?"
p100
aVand several messages popped up immediately.
p101
aVThey were from students and journalists
p102
aVand friendly strangers like this one.
p103
aVI did radio interviews and they asked.
p104
aVI even gave a talk, and one woman shouted up to the stage,
p105
aV"Hey Mandy, where's your boyfriend?"
p106
aVAnd I promptly turned bright red.
p107
aa(lp108
VI understand that this is part of the deal.
p109
aVIf you write about your relationship in an international newspaper,
p110
aVyou should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
p111
aVBut I just wasn't prepared for the scope of the response.
p112
aVThe 36 questions seem to have taken on a life of their own.
p113
aVIn fact, the New York Times published a follow-up article
p114
aVfor Valentine's Day,
p115
aVwhich featured readers' experiences of trying the study themselves,
p116
aVwith varying degrees of success.
p117
aa(lp118
VSo my first impulse in the face of all of this attention
p119
aVwas to become very protective of my own relationship.
p120
aVI said no to every request for the two of us
p121
aVto do a media appearance together.
p122
aVI turned down TV interviews,
p123
aVand I said no to every request for photos of the two us.
p124
aVI think I was afraid that we would become
p125
aVinadvertent icons for the process of falling in love,
p126
aVa position I did not at all feel qualified for.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd I get it:
p129
aVpeople didn't just want to know if the study worked,
p130
aVthey wanted to know if it really worked:
p131
aVthat is, if it was capable of producing love that would last,
p132
aVnot just a fling, but real love, sustainable love.
p133
aa(lp134
VBut this was a question I didn't feel capable of answering.
p135
aVMy own relationship was only a few months old,
p136
aVand I felt like people were asking the wrong question in the first place.
p137
aVWhat would knowing whether or not we were still together really tell them?
p138
aVIf the answer was no,
p139
aVwould it make the experience of doing these 36 questions
p140
aVany less worthwhile?
p141
aVDr. Arthur Aron first wrote about these questions
p142
aVin this study here in 1997,
p143
aVand here, the researcher's goal was not to produce romantic love.
p144
aVInstead, they wanted to foster
p145
aVinterpersonal closeness among college students,
p146
aVby using what Aron called
p147
aV"sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personalistic self-disclosure."
p148
aVSounds romantic, doesn't it?
p149
aVBut the study did work.
p150
aVThe participants did feel closer after doing it,
p151
aVand several subsequent studies have also used Aron's fast friends protocol
p152
aVas a way to quickly create trust and intimacy between strangers.
p153
aVThey've used it between members of the police and members of community,
p154
aVand they've used it between people of opposing political ideologies.
p155
aVThe original version of the story,
p156
aVthe one that I tried last summer,
p157
aVthat pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contact,
p158
aVwas referenced in this article,
p159
aVbut unfortunately it was never published.
p160
aa(lp161
VSo a few months ago, I was giving a talk
p162
aVat a small liberal arts college,
p163
aVand a student came up to me afterwards
p164
aVand he said, kind of shyly,
p165
aV"So, I tried your study, and it didn't work."
p166
aVHe seemed a little mystified by this.
p167
aV"You mean, you didn't fall in love with the person you did it with?" I asked.
p168
aa(lp169
V"Well..." He paused.
p170
aV"I think she just wants to be friends."
p171
aa(lp172
V"But did you become better friends?" I asked.
p173
aV"Did you feel like you got to really know each other after doing the study?"
p174
aVHe nodded.
p175
aa(lp176
V"So, then it worked," I said.
p177
aa(lp178
VI don't think this is the answer he was looking for.
p179
aVIn fact, I don't think this is the answer that any of us are looking for
p180
aVwhen it comes to love.
p181
aa(lp182
VI first came across this study
p183
aVwhen I was 29
p184
aVand I was going through a really difficult breakup.
p185
aVI had been in the relationship since I was 20,
p186
aVwhich was basically my entire adult life,
p187
aVand he was my first real love,
p188
aVand I had no idea how or if I could make a life without him.
p189
aVSo I turned to science.
p190
aVI researched everything I could find about the science of romantic love,
p191
aVand I think I was hoping that it might somehow inoculate me from heartache.
p192
aVI don't know if I realized this at the time \u2014
p193
aVI thought I was just doing research for this book I was writing \u2014
p194
aVbut it seems really obvious in retrospect.
p195
aVI hoped that if I armed myself with the knowledge of romantic love,
p196
aVI might never have to feel as terrible and lonely as I did then.
p197
aVAnd all this knowledge has been useful in some ways.
p198
aVI am more patient with love. I am more relaxed.
p199
aVI am more confident about asking for what I want.
p200
aVBut I can also see myself more clearly,
p201
aVand I can see that what I want is sometimes more
p202
aVthan can reasonably be asked for.
p203
aVWhat I want from love is a guarantee,
p204
aVnot just that I am loved today
p205
aVand that I will be loved tomorrow,
p206
aVbut that I will continue to be loved by the person I love indefinitely.
p207
aVMaybe it's this possibility of a guarantee
p208
aVthat people were really asking about
p209
aVwhen they wanted to know if we were still together.
p210
aa(lp211
VSo the story that the media told about the 36 questions
p212
aVwas that there might be a shortcut to falling in love.
p213
aVThere might be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk involved,
p214
aVand this is a very appealing story,
p215
aVbecause falling in love feels amazing,
p216
aVbut it's also terrifying.
p217
aVThe moment you admit to loving someone,
p218
aVyou admit to having a lot to lose,
p219
aVand it's true that these questions do provide a mechanism
p220
aVfor getting to know someone quickly,
p221
aVwhich is also a mechanism for being known,
p222
aVand I think this is the thing that most of us really want from love:
p223
aVto be known, to be seen, to be understood.
p224
aVBut I think when it comes to love,
p225
aVwe are too willing to accept the short version of the story.
p226
aVThe version of the story that asks, "Are you still together?"
p227
aVand is content with a yes or no answer.
p228
aa(lp229
VSo rather than that question,
p230
aVI would propose we ask some more difficult questions,
p231
aVquestions like:
p232
aVHow do you decide who deserves your love
p233
aVand who does not?
p234
aVHow do you stay in love when things get difficult,
p235
aVand how do you know when to just cut and run?
p236
aVHow do you live with the doubt
p237
aVthat inevitably creeps into every relationship,
p238
aVor even harder,
p239
aVhow do you live with your partner's doubt?
p240
aVI don't necessarily know the answers to these questions,
p241
aVbut I think they're an important start at having a more thoughtful conversation
p242
aVabout what it means to love someone.
p243
aa(lp244
VSo, if you want it,
p245
aVthe short version of the story of my relationship is this:
p246
aVa year ago, an acquaintance and I did a study
p247
aVdesigned to create romantic love,
p248
aVand we fell in love,
p249
aVand we are still together,
p250
aVand I am so glad.
p251
aa(lp252
VBut falling in love is not the same thing as staying in love.
p253
aVFalling in love is the easy part.
p254
aVSo at the end of my article, I wrote, "Love didn't happen to us.
p255
aVWe're in love because we each made the choice to be."
p256
aVAnd I cringe a little when I read that now,
p257
aVnot because it isn't true,
p258
aVbut because at the time, I really hadn't considered
p259
aVeverything that was contained in that choice.
p260
aVI didn't consider how many times we would each have to make that choice,
p261
aVand how many times I will continue to have to make that choice
p262
aVwithout knowing whether or not he will always choose me.
p263
aVI want it to be enough to have asked and answered 36 questions,
p264
aVand to have chosen to love someone so generous and kind and fun
p265
aVand to have broadcast that choice in the biggest newspaper in America.
p266
aVBut what I have done instead is turn my relationship
p267
aVinto the kind of myth I don't quite believe in.
p268
aVAnd what I want, what perhaps I will spend my life wanting,
p269
aVis for that myth to be true.
p270
aa(lp271
VI want the happy ending implied by the title to my article,
p272
aVwhich is, incidentally,
p273
aVthe only part of the article that I didn't actually write.
p274
aa(lp275
V(Laughter)
p276
aa(lp277
VBut what I have instead is the chance to make the choice to love someone,
p278
aVand the hope that he will choose to love me back,
p279
aVand it is terrifying,
p280
aVbut that's the deal with love.
p281
aa(lp282
VThank you.
