VWhat you're doing,
p4
aVright now, at this very moment,
p5
aVis killing you.
p6
aVMore than cars or the Internet
p7
aVor even that little mobile device we keep talking about,
p8
aVthe technology you're using the most almost every day
p9
aVis this, your tush.
p10
aVNowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day,
p11
aVwhich is more than we're sleeping, at 7.7 hours.
p12
aVSitting is so incredibly prevalent,
p13
aVwe don't even question how much we're doing it,
p14
aVand because everyone else is doing it,
p15
aVit doesn't even occur to us that it's not okay.
p16
aVIn that way, sitting has become
p17
aVthe smoking of our generation.
p18
aa(lp19
VOf course there's health consequences to this,
p20
aVscary ones, besides the waist.
p21
aVThings like breast cancer and colon cancer
p22
aVare directly tied to our lack of physical [activity],
p23
aVTen percent in fact, on both of those.
p24
aVSix percent for heart disease,
p25
aVseven percent for type 2 diabetes,
p26
aVwhich is what my father died of.
p27
aVNow, any of those stats should convince each of us
p28
aVto get off our duff more,
p29
aVbut if you're anything like me, it won't.
p30
aa(lp31
VWhat did get me moving was a social interaction.
p32
aVSomeone invited me to a meeting,
p33
aVbut couldn't manage to fit me in
p34
aVto a regular sort of conference room meeting, and said,
p35
aV"I have to walk my dogs tomorrow. Could you come then?"
p36
aVIt seemed kind of odd to do,
p37
aVand actually, that first meeting, I remember thinking,
p38
aV"I have to be the one to ask the next question,"
p39
aVbecause I knew I was going to huff and puff
p40
aVduring this conversation.
p41
aVAnd yet, I've taken that idea and made it my own.
p42
aVSo instead of going to coffee meetings
p43
aVor fluorescent-lit conference room meetings,
p44
aVI ask people to go on a walking meeting,
p45
aVto the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week.
p46
aVIt's changed my life.
p47
aa(lp48
VBut before that, what actually happened was,
p49
aVI used to think about it as,
p50
aVyou could take care of your health,
p51
aVor you could take care of obligations,
p52
aVand one always came at the cost of the other.
p53
aVSo now, several hundred of these walking meetings later,
p54
aVI've learned a few things.
p55
aa(lp56
VFirst, there's this amazing thing
p57
aVabout actually getting out of the box
p58
aVthat leads to out-of-the-box thinking.
p59
aVWhether it's nature or the exercise itself, it certainly works.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd second, and probably the more reflective one,
p62
aVis just about how much each of us
p63
aVcan hold problems in opposition
p64
aVwhen they're really not that way.
p65
aVAnd if we're going to solve problems
p66
aVand look at the world really differently,
p67
aVwhether it's in governance or business
p68
aVor environmental issues, job creation,
p69
aVmaybe we can think about how to reframe those problems
p70
aVas having both things be true.
p71
aVBecause it was when that happened
p72
aVwith this walk-and-talk idea
p73
aVthat things became doable and sustainable and viable.
p74
aa(lp75
VSo I started this talk talking about the tush,
p76
aVso I'll end with the bottom line, which is,
p77
aVwalk and talk.
p78
aVWalk the talk.
p79
aVYou'll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking,
p80
aVand in the way that you do,
p81
aVyou'll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas.
p82
aa(lp83
VThank you.
