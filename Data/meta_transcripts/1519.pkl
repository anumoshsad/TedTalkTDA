VAs an architect, I often ask myself,
p4
aVwhat is the origin of the forms that we design?
p5
aVWhat kind of forms could we design
p6
aVif we wouldn't work with references anymore?
p7
aVIf we had no bias, if we had no preconceptions,
p8
aVwhat kind of forms could we design
p9
aVif we could free ourselves from
p10
aVour experience?
p11
aVIf we could free ourselves from our education?
p12
aVWhat would these unseen forms look like?
p13
aVWould they surprise us? Would they intrigue us?
p14
aVWould they delight us?
p15
aVIf so, then how can we go about creating something that is truly new?
p16
aa(lp17
VI propose we look to nature.
p18
aVNature has been called the greatest architect of forms.
p19
aVAnd I'm not saying that we should copy nature,
p20
aVI'm not saying we should mimic biology,
p21
aVinstead I propose that we can borrow nature's processes.
p22
aVWe can abstract them and to create something that is new.
p23
aVNature's main process of creation, morphogenesis,
p24
aVis the splitting of one cell into two cells.
p25
aVAnd these cells can either be identical,
p26
aVor they can be distinct from each other
p27
aVthrough asymmetric cell division.
p28
aa(lp29
VIf we abstract this process, and simplify it as much as possible,
p30
aVthen we could start with a single sheet of paper,
p31
aVone surface, and we could make a fold
p32
aVand divide the surface into two surfaces.
p33
aVWe're free to choose where we make the fold.
p34
aVAnd by doing so, we can differentiate the surfaces.
p35
aVThrough this very simple process,
p36
aVwe can create an astounding variety of forms.
p37
aa(lp38
VNow, we can take this form and use the same process
p39
aVto generate three-dimensional structures,
p40
aVbut rather than folding things by hand,
p41
aVwe'll bring the structure into the computer,
p42
aVand code it as an algorithm.
p43
aVAnd in doing so, we can suddenly fold anything.
p44
aVWe can fold a million times faster,
p45
aVwe can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations.
p46
aa(lp47
VAnd as we're seeking to make something three-dimensional,
p48
aVwe start not with a single surface, but with a volume.
p49
aVA simple volume, the cube.
p50
aVIf we take its surfaces and fold them
p51
aVagain and again and again and again,
p52
aVthen after 16 iterations, 16 steps,
p53
aVwe end up with 400,000 surfaces and a shape that looks,
p54
aVfor instance, like this.
p55
aVAnd if we change where we make the folds,
p56
aVif we change the folding ratio,
p57
aVthen this cube turns into this one.
p58
aVWe can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape,
p59
aVor this shape.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo we exert control over the form
p62
aVby specifying the position of where we're making the fold,
p63
aVbut essentially you're looking at a folded cube.
p64
aVAnd we can play with this.
p65
aVWe can apply different folding ratios to different parts
p66
aVof the form to create local conditions.
p67
aVWe can begin to sculpt the form.
p68
aa(lp69
VAnd because we're doing the folding on the computer,
p70
aVwe are completely free of any physical constraints.
p71
aVSo that means that surfaces can intersect themselves,
p72
aVthey can become impossibly small.
p73
aVWe can make folds that we otherwise could not make.
p74
aVSurfaces can become porous.
p75
aVThey can stretch. They can tear.
p76
aVAnd all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce.
p77
aa(lp78
VBut in each case, I didn't design the form.
p79
aVI designed the process that generated the form.
p80
aVIn general, if we make a small change to the folding ratio,
p81
aVwhich is what you're seeing here,
p82
aVthen the form changes correspondingly.
p83
aa(lp84
VBut that's only half of the story \u2014
p85
aV99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this,
p86
aVbut this, the geometric equivalent of noise.
p87
aVThe forms that I showed before were made actually
p88
aVthrough very long trial and error.
p89
aVA far more effective way to create forms, I have found,
p90
aVis to use information that is already contained in forms.
p91
aVA very simple form such as this one actually contains
p92
aVa lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye.
p93
aVSo, for instance, we can plot the length of the edges.
p94
aVWhite surfaces have long edges, black ones have short ones.
p95
aVWe can plot the planarity of the surfaces, their curvature,
p96
aVhow radial they are \u2014 all information that may not be
p97
aVinstantly visible to you,
p98
aVbut that we can bring out, that we can articulate,
p99
aVand that we can use to control the folding.
p100
aa(lp101
VSo now I'm not specifying a single
p102
aVratio anymore to fold it,
p103
aVbut instead I'm establishing a rule,
p104
aVI'm establishing a link between a property of a surface
p105
aVand how that surface is folded.
p106
aVAnd because I've designed the process and not the form,
p107
aVI can run the process again and again and again
p108
aVto produce a whole family of forms.
p109
aa(lp110
VThese forms look elaborate, but the process is a very minimal one.
p111
aVThere is a simple input,
p112
aVit's always a cube that I start with,
p113
aVand it's a very simple operation \u2014 it's making a fold,
p114
aVand doing this over and over again.
p115
aa(lp116
VSo let's bring this process to architecture.
p117
aVHow? And at what scale?
p118
aVI chose to design a column.
p119
aVColumns are architectural archetypes.
p120
aVThey've been used throughout history to express ideals
p121
aVabout beauty, about technology.
p122
aVA challenge to me was how we could express
p123
aVthis new algorithmic order in a column.
p124
aVI started using four cylinders.
p125
aVThrough a lot of experimentation, these cylinders
p126
aVeventually evolved into this.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd these columns, they have information at very many scales.
p129
aVWe can begin to zoom into them.
p130
aVThe closer one gets, the more new features one discovers.
p131
aVSome formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility.
p132
aVAnd unlike traditional architecture,
p133
aVit's a single process that creates both the overall form
p134
aVand the microscopic surface detail.
p135
aVThese forms are undrawable.
p136
aVAn architect who's drawing them with a pen and a paper
p137
aVwould probably take months,
p138
aVor it would take even a year to draw all the sections,
p139
aVall of the elevations, you can only create something like this
p140
aVthrough an algorithm.
p141
aa(lp142
VThe more interesting question, perhaps, is,
p143
aVare these forms imaginable?
p144
aVUsually, an architect can somehow envision the end state
p145
aVof what he is designing.
p146
aVIn this case, the process is deterministic.
p147
aVThere's no randomness involved at all,
p148
aVbut it's not entirely predictable.
p149
aVThere's too many surfaces,
p150
aVthere's too much detail, one can't see the end state.
p151
aa(lp152
VSo this leads to a new role for the architect.
p153
aVOne needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities
p154
aVthat are out there.
p155
aVFor one thing, one can design many variants of a form,
p156
aVin parallel, and one can cultivate them.
p157
aVAnd to go back to the analogy with nature,
p158
aVone can begin to think in terms of populations,
p159
aVone can talk about permutations, about generations,
p160
aVabout crossing and breeding to come up with a design.
p161
aVAnd the architect is really, he moves into the position
p162
aVof being an orchestrator of all of these processes.
p163
aa(lp164
VBut enough of the theory.
p165
aVAt one point I simply wanted to jump inside
p166
aVthis image, so to say, I bought these red and blue
p167
aV3D glasses, got up very close to the screen,
p168
aVbut still that wasn't the same as being able to
p169
aVwalk around and touch things.
p170
aVSo there was only one possibility \u2014
p171
aVto bring the column out of the computer.
p172
aa(lp173
VThere's been a lot of talk now about 3D printing.
p174
aVFor me, or for my purpose at this moment,
p175
aVthere's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff
p176
aVbetween scale, on the one hand, and resolution and speed, on the other.
p177
aVSo instead, we decided to take the column,
p178
aVand we decided to build it as a layered model,
p179
aVmade out of very many slices, thinly stacked over each other.
p180
aa(lp181
VWhat you're looking at here is an X-ray
p182
aVof the column that you just saw, viewed from the top.
p183
aVUnbeknownst to me at the time,
p184
aVbecause we had only seen the outside,
p185
aVthe surfaces were continuing to fold themselves,
p186
aVto grow on the inside of the column,
p187
aVwhich was quite a surprising discovery.
p188
aVFrom this shape, we calculated a cutting line,
p189
aVand then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter
p190
aVto produce \u2014 and you're seeing a segment of it here \u2014
p191
aVvery many thin slices, individually cut, on top of each other.
p192
aa(lp193
VAnd this is a photo now, it's not a rendering,
p194
aVand the column that we ended up with
p195
aVafter a lot of work, ended up looking remarkably like the one
p196
aVthat we had designed in the computer.
p197
aVAlmost all of the details, almost all of the
p198
aVsurface intricacies were preserved.
p199
aa(lp200
VBut it was very labor intensive.
p201
aVThere's a huge disconnect at the moment still
p202
aVbetween the virtual and the physical.
p203
aVIt took me several months to design the column,
p204
aVbut ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds
p205
aVto calculate all of the 16 million faces.
p206
aVThe physical model, on the other hand,
p207
aVis 2,700 layers, one millimeter thick,
p208
aVit weighs 700 kilos, it's made of sheet that can cover
p209
aVthis entire auditorium.
p210
aVAnd the cutting path that the laser followed
p211
aVgoes from here to the airport and back again.
p212
aa(lp213
VBut it is increasingly possible.
p214
aVMachines are getting faster, it's getting less expensive,
p215
aVand there's some promising technological developments
p216
aVjust on the horizon.
p217
aVThese are images from the Gwangju Biennale.
p218
aVAnd in this case, I used ABS plastic to produce the columns,
p219
aVwe used the bigger, faster machine,
p220
aVand they have a steel core inside, so they're structural,
p221
aVthey can bear loads for once.
p222
aVEach column is effectively a hybrid of two columns.
p223
aVYou can see a different column in the mirror,
p224
aVif there's a mirror behind the column
p225
aVthat creates a sort of an optical illusion.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo where does this leave us?
p228
aVI think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us
p229
aVif we as architects begin to think about designing not the object,
p230
aVbut a process to generate objects.
p231
aVI've shown one simple process that was inspired by nature;
p232
aVthere's countless other ones.
p233
aVIn short, we have no constraints.
p234
aVInstead, we have processes in our hands right now
p235
aVthat allow us to create structures at all scales
p236
aVthat we couldn't even have dreamt up.
p237
aVAnd, if I may add, at one point we will build them.
