VThe humanitarian model has barely changed
p4
aVsince the early 20th century.
p5
aVIts origins are firmly rooted
p6
aVin the analog age.
p7
aVAnd there is a major shift coming on the horizon.
p8
aVThe catalyst for this change
p9
aVwas the major earthquake that struck Haiti
p10
aVon the 12th of January in 2010.
p11
aVHaiti was a game changer.
p12
aVThe earthquake destroyed the capital of Port-au-Prince,
p13
aVclaiming the lives of some 320,000 people,
p14
aVrendering homeless
p15
aVabout 1.2 million people.
p16
aVGovernment institutions were completely decapitated,
p17
aVincluding the presidential palace.
p18
aVI remember standing
p19
aVon the roof of the Ministry of Justice
p20
aVin downtown Port-au-Prince.
p21
aVIt was about two meters high,
p22
aVcompletely squashed
p23
aVby the violence of the earthquake.
p24
aa(lp25
VFor those of us on the ground in those early days,
p26
aVit was clear for even the most disaster-hardened veterans
p27
aVthat Haiti was something different.
p28
aVHaiti was something we hadn't seen before.
p29
aVBut Haiti provided us with something else unprecedented.
p30
aVHaiti allowed us to glimpse into a future
p31
aVof what disaster response might look like
p32
aVin a hyper-connected world
p33
aVwhere people have access
p34
aVto mobile smart devices.
p35
aa(lp36
VBecause out of the urban devastation
p37
aVin Port-au-Prince
p38
aVcame a torrent of SMS texts \u2014
p39
aVpeople crying for help,
p40
aVbeseeching us for assistance,
p41
aVsharing data, offering support,
p42
aVlooking for their loved ones.
p43
aVThis was a situation
p44
aVthat traditional aid agencies had never before encountered.
p45
aVWe were in one of the poorest countries on the planet,
p46
aVbut 80 percent of the people
p47
aVhad mobile devices in their hands.
p48
aVAnd we were unprepared for this,
p49
aVand they were shaping the aid effort.
p50
aa(lp51
VOutside Haiti also, things were looking different.
p52
aVTens of thousands of so-called digital volunteers
p53
aVwere scouring the Internet,
p54
aVconverting tweets
p55
aVthat had already been converted from texts
p56
aVand putting these into open-source maps,
p57
aVlayering them with all sorts of important information \u2014
p58
aVpeople like Crisis Mappers and Open Street Map \u2014
p59
aVand putting these on the Web for everybody \u2014
p60
aVthe media, the aid organizations and the communities themselves \u2014
p61
aVto participate in and to use.
p62
aa(lp63
VBack in Haiti,
p64
aVpeople were increasingly turning
p65
aVto the medium of SMS.
p66
aVPeople that were hungry and hurting
p67
aVwere signaling their distress,
p68
aVwere signaling their need for help.
p69
aVOn street sides all over Port-au-Prince,
p70
aVentrepreneurs sprung up
p71
aVoffering mobile phone charging stations.
p72
aVThey understood more than we did
p73
aVpeople's innate need
p74
aVto be connected.
p75
aa(lp76
VNever having been confronted
p77
aVwith this type of situation before,
p78
aVwe wanted to try and understand
p79
aVhow we could tap into this incredible resource,
p80
aVhow we could really leverage
p81
aVthis incredible use of mobile technology
p82
aVand SMS technology.
p83
aVWe started talking with a local telecom provider called Voilà,
p84
aVwhich is a subsidiary of Trilogy International.
p85
aVWe had basically three requirements.
p86
aVWe wanted to communicate
p87
aVin a two-way form of communication.
p88
aVWe didn't want to shout; we needed to listen as well.
p89
aVWe wanted to be able to target
p90
aVspecific geographic communities.
p91
aVWe didn't need to talk to the whole country at the same time.
p92
aVAnd we wanted it to be easy to use.
p93
aa(lp94
VOut of this rubble of Haiti and from this devastation
p95
aVcame something that we call TERA \u2014
p96
aVthe Trilogy Emergency Response Application \u2014
p97
aVwhich has been used to support the aid effort
p98
aVever since.
p99
aVIt has been used to help communities prepare for disasters.
p100
aVIt has been used to signal early warning
p101
aVin advance of weather-related disasters.
p102
aVIt's used for public health awareness campaigns
p103
aVsuch as the prevention of cholera.
p104
aVAnd it is even used for sensitive issues
p105
aVsuch as building awareness
p106
aVaround gender-based violence.
p107
aa(lp108
VBut does it work?
p109
aVWe have just published
p110
aVan evaluation of this program,
p111
aVand the evidence that is there for all to see
p112
aVis quite remarkable.
p113
aVSome 74 percent of people
p114
aVreceived the data.
p115
aVThose who were intended to receive the data,
p116
aV74 percent of them received it.
p117
aV96 percent of them
p118
aVfound it useful.
p119
aV83 percent of them took action \u2014
p120
aVevidence that it is indeed empowering.
p121
aVAnd 73 percent of them shared it.
p122
aa(lp123
VThe TERA system
p124
aVwas developed from Haiti
p125
aVwith support of engineers in the region.
p126
aVIt is a user-appropriate technology
p127
aVthat has been used for humanitarian good to great effect.
p128
aVTechnology is transformational.
p129
aVRight across the developing world,
p130
aVcitizens and communities
p131
aVare using technology
p132
aVto enable them to bring about change, positive change,
p133
aVin their own communities.
p134
aVThe grassroots has been strengthened
p135
aVthrough the social power of sharing
p136
aVand they are challenging the old models,
p137
aVthe old analog models
p138
aVof control and command.
p139
aa(lp140
VOne illustration of the transformational power of technology
p141
aVis in Kibera.
p142
aVKibera is one of Africa's largest slums.
p143
aVIt's on the outskirts of Nairobi,
p144
aVthe capital city of Kenya.
p145
aVIt's home to an unknown number of people \u2014
p146
aVsome say between 250,000
p147
aVand 1.2 million.
p148
aVIf you were to arrive in Nairobi today
p149
aVand pick up a tourist map,
p150
aVKibera is represented
p151
aVas a lush, green national park
p152
aVdevoid of human settlement.
p153
aa(lp154
VYoung people living in Kibera
p155
aVin their community,
p156
aVwith simple handheld devices,
p157
aVGPS handheld devices and SMS-enabled mobile phones,
p158
aVhave literally put themselves on the map.
p159
aVThey have collated crowd-sourced data
p160
aVand rendered the invisible visible.
p161
aVPeople like Josh and Steve
p162
aVare continuing to layer information upon information,
p163
aVreal-time information, Tweet it and text it onto these maps
p164
aVfor all to use.
p165
aVYou can find out about the latest impromptu music session.
p166
aVYou can find out about the latest security incident.
p167
aVYou can find out about places of worship.
p168
aVYou can find out about the health centers.
p169
aVYou can feel the dynamism
p170
aVof this living, breathing community.
p171
aVThey also have their own news network on YouTube
p172
aVwith 36,000 viewers at the moment.
p173
aa(lp174
VThey're showing us what can be done
p175
aVwith mobile, digital technologies.
p176
aVThey're showing that the magic of technology
p177
aVcan bring the invisible visible.
p178
aVAnd they are giving a voice to themselves.
p179
aVThey are telling their own story,
p180
aVbypassing the official narrative.
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd we're seeing from all points on the globe similar stories.
p183
aVIn Mongolia for instance,
p184
aVwhere 30 percent of the people are nomadic,
p185
aVSMS information systems are being used
p186
aVto track migration and weather patterns.
p187
aVSMS is even used
p188
aVto hold herder summits
p189
aVfrom remote participation.
p190
aVAnd if people are migrating
p191
aVinto urban, unfamiliar, concrete environments,
p192
aVthey can also be helped in anticipation
p193
aVwith social supporters ready and waiting for them
p194
aVbased on SMS knowledge.
p195
aVIn Nigeria,
p196
aVopen-source SMS tools
p197
aVare being used by the Red Cross community workers
p198
aVto gather information from the local community
p199
aVin an attempt to better understand and mitigate
p200
aVthe prevalence of malaria.
p201
aVMy colleague, Jason Peat, who runs this program,
p202
aVtells me it's 10 times faster and 10 times cheaper
p203
aVthan the traditional way of doing things.
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd not only is it empowering to the communities,
p206
aVbut really importantly,
p207
aVthis information stays in the community
p208
aVwhere it is needed to formulate long-term health polices.
p209
aVWe are on a planet
p210
aVof seven billion people,
p211
aVfive billion mobile subscriptions.
p212
aVBy 2015,
p213
aVthere will be three billion smartphones in the world.
p214
aVThe U.N. broadband commission
p215
aVhas recently set targets
p216
aVto help broadband access
p217
aVin 50 percent of the Developing World,
p218
aVcompared to 20 percent today.
p219
aVWe are hurtling towards a hyper-connected world
p220
aVwhere citizens from all cultures and all social strata
p221
aVwill have access to smart, fast mobile devices.
p222
aa(lp223
VPeople are understanding,
p224
aVfrom Cairo to Oakland,
p225
aVthat there are new ways to come together,
p226
aVthere are new ways to mobilize,
p227
aVthere are new ways to influence.
p228
aVA transformation is coming which needs to be understood
p229
aVby the humanitarian structures and humanitarian models.
p230
aVThe collective voices of people
p231
aVneeds to be more integrated through new technologies
p232
aVinto the organizational strategies and plans of actions
p233
aVand not just recycled
p234
aVfor fundraising or marketing.
p235
aVWe need to, for example, embrace
p236
aVthe big data,
p237
aVthe knowledge that is there from market leaders
p238
aVwho understand what it means
p239
aVto use and leverage big data.
p240
aa(lp241
VOne idea that I'd like you to consider, for instance,
p242
aVis to take a look at our IT departments.
p243
aVThey're normally backroom or basement hardware service providers,
p244
aVbut they need to be elevated to software strategists.
p245
aVWe need people in our organizations
p246
aVwho know what it's like to work with big data.
p247
aVWe need technology
p248
aVas a core organizational principle.
p249
aVWe need technological strategists in the boardroom
p250
aVwho can ask and answer the question,
p251
aV"What would Amazon or Google
p252
aVdo with all of this data?"
p253
aVand convert it to humanitarian good.
p254
aa(lp255
VThe possibilities
p256
aVthat new digital technologies are bringing
p257
aVcan help humanitarian organizations,
p258
aVnot only ensure
p259
aVthat people's right to information is met,
p260
aVor that they have their right to communicate,
p261
aVbut I think in the future,
p262
aVhumanitarian organizations will also have to anticipate
p263
aVthe right for people to access
p264
aVcritical communication technologies
p265
aVin order to ensure
p266
aVthat their voices are heard,
p267
aVthat they're truly participating,
p268
aVthat they're truly empowered in the humanitarian world.
p269
aVIt has always been the elusive ideal
p270
aVto ensure full participation of people affected by disasters
p271
aVin the humanitarian effort.
p272
aVWe now have the tools. We now have the possibilities.
p273
aVThere are no more reasons not to do it.
p274
aVI believe we need to bring the humanitarian world
p275
aVfrom analog to digital.
p276
aa(lp277
