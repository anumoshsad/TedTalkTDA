VWhat I'm going to do is to just give a few notes,
p4
aVand this is from a book I'm preparing called
p5
aV"Letters to a Young Scientist."
p6
aVI'd thought it'd be appropriate to
p7
aVpresent it, on the basis that I have had extensive experience
p8
aVin teaching, counseling scientists across a broad array of fields.
p9
aVAnd you might like to hear some of the principles that I've developed in doing
p10
aVthat teaching and counseling.
p11
aa(lp12
VSo let me begin by urging you,
p13
aVparticularly you on the youngsters' side,
p14
aVon this path you've chosen,
p15
aVto go as far as you can.
p16
aVThe world needs you, badly.
p17
aVHumanity is now fully into the techno-scientific age.
p18
aVThere is going to be no turning back.
p19
aa(lp20
VAlthough varying among disciplines \u2014 say, astrophysics,
p21
aVmolecular genetics, the immunology, the microbiology, the public
p22
aVhealth, to the new area of the human body as a symbiont,
p23
aVto public health, environmental science.
p24
aVKnowledge in medical science and science overall
p25
aVis doubling every 15 to 20 years.
p26
aVTechnology is increasing at a comparable rate.
p27
aVBetween them, the two already pervade,
p28
aVas most of you here seated realize,
p29
aVevery dimension of human life.
p30
aa(lp31
VSo swift is the velocity of the techno-scientific revolution,
p32
aVso startling in its countless twists and turns, that no one can predict
p33
aVits outcome even a decade from the present moment.
p34
aa(lp35
VThere will come a time, of course,
p36
aVwhen the exponential growth of discovery and knowledge,
p37
aVwhich actually began in the 1600s,
p38
aVhas to peak and level off,
p39
aVbut that's not going to matter to you.
p40
aVThe revolution is going to continue
p41
aVfor at least several more decades.
p42
aVIt'll render the human condition
p43
aVradically different from what it is today.
p44
aVTraditional fields of study are going to continue to grow
p45
aVand in so doing, inevitably they will meet and create new disciplines.
p46
aa(lp47
VIn time, all of science will come to be
p48
aVa continuum of description, an explanation of networks, of principles and laws.
p49
aVThat's why you need not just be training
p50
aVin one specialty, but also acquire breadth in other fields,
p51
aVrelated to and even distant from your own initial choice.
p52
aa(lp53
VKeep your eyes lifted and your head turning.
p54
aVThe search for knowledge is in our genes.
p55
aVIt was put there by our distant ancestors
p56
aVwho spread across the world,
p57
aVand it's never going to be quenched.
p58
aVTo understand and use it sanely,
p59
aVas a part of the civilization yet to evolve
p60
aVrequires a vastly larger population of scientifically trained people like you.
p61
aVIn education, medicine, law, diplomacy,
p62
aVgovernment, business and the media that exist today.
p63
aa(lp64
VOur political leaders need at least a modest degree of scientific
p65
aVliteracy, which most badly lack today \u2014
p66
aVno applause, please.
p67
aVIt will be better for all
p68
aVif they prepare before entering office rather than learning on the job.
p69
aVTherefore you will do well to act on the side,
p70
aVno matter how far into the laboratory
p71
aVyou may go, to serve as teachers
p72
aVduring the span of your career.
p73
aa(lp74
VI'll now proceed quickly,
p75
aVand before else, to a subject that is both a vital asset
p76
aVand a potential barrier to a scientific career.
p77
aVIf you are a bit short in mathematical skills,
p78
aVdon't worry.
p79
aVMany of the most successful scientists
p80
aVat work today are mathematically semi-literate.
p81
aa(lp82
VA metaphor will serve here:
p83
aVWhere elite mathematicians and statisticians
p84
aVand theorists often serve as architects in the expanding realm
p85
aVof science, the remaining large majority of
p86
aVbasic applied scientists, including a large portion of those who could be
p87
aVsaid to be of the first rank, are the ones who map the terrain, they scout
p88
aVthe frontiers, they cut the pathways,
p89
aVthey raise the buildings along the way.
p90
aa(lp91
VSome may have considered me foolhardy,
p92
aVbut it's been my habit to brush aside the fear of mathematics
p93
aVwhen talking to candidate scientists.
p94
aVDuring 41 years of teaching biology at Harvard,
p95
aVI watched sadly as bright students turned away
p96
aVfrom the possibility of a scientific career
p97
aVor even from taking non-required courses in science
p98
aVbecause they were afraid of failure.
p99
aVThese math-phobes deprive science and medicine
p100
aVof immeasurable amounts of badly needed talent.
p101
aa(lp102
VHere's how to relax your anxieties, if you have them:
p103
aVUnderstand that mathematics is a language
p104
aVruled like other verbal languages,
p105
aVor like verbal language generally, by its own grammar
p106
aVand system of logic.
p107
aVAny person with average quantitative intelligence
p108
aVwho learns to read and write mathematics
p109
aVat an elementary level will, as in verbal language, have little difficulty
p110
aVpicking up most of the fundamentals
p111
aVif they choose to master the mathspeak of most disciplines of science.
p112
aa(lp113
VThe longer you wait to become at least semi-literate
p114
aVthe harder the language of mathematics will be to master, just as again in any verbal
p115
aVlanguage, but it can be done at any age.
p116
aVI speak as an authority
p117
aVon that subject, because I'm an extreme case.
p118
aVI didn't take algebra until my freshman year
p119
aVat the University of Alabama.
p120
aVThey didn't teach it before then.
p121
aa(lp122
VI finally got around to calculus as a 32-year-old tenured professor at Harvard,
p123
aVwhere I sat uncomfortably in classes with undergraduate students,
p124
aVlittle more than half my age.
p125
aVA couple of them were students
p126
aVin a course I was giving on evolutionary biology.
p127
aVI swallowed my pride, and I learned calculus.
p128
aa(lp129
VI found out that in science and all its applications,
p130
aVwhat is crucial is not that technical ability,
p131
aVbut it is imagination in all of its applications.
p132
aVThe ability to form concepts with images of entities and processes
p133
aVpictured by intuition.
p134
aVI found out that advances in science rarely come upstream
p135
aVfrom an ability to stand at a blackboard
p136
aVand conjure images from unfolding mathematical propositions
p137
aVand equations.
p138
aVThey are instead the products of downstream imagination leading to hard work,
p139
aVduring which mathematical reasoning may or may not prove to be relevant.
p140
aVIdeas emerge when a part of the real or imagined world is studied
p141
aVfor its own sake.
p142
aa(lp143
VOf foremost importance is a thorough, well-organized knowledge
p144
aVof all that is known of the relevant entities and processes that might be involved in that domain
p145
aVyou propose to enter.
p146
aVWhen something new is discovered,
p147
aVit's logical then that one of the follow-up steps is
p148
aVto find the mathematical and statistical methods to move its analysis forward.
p149
aVIf that step proves too difficult for
p150
aVthe person or team that made the discovery,
p151
aVa mathematician can then be added by them
p152
aVas a collaborator.
p153
aa(lp154
VConsider the following principle,
p155
aVwhich I will modestly call Wilson's Principle Number One:
p156
aVIt is far easier for scientists
p157
aVincluding medical researchers, to require needed collaboration
p158
aVin mathematics and statistics
p159
aVthan it is for mathematicians and statisticians
p160
aVto find scientists able to make use of their equations.
p161
aVIt is important in choosing the direction to take in science
p162
aVto find the subject at your level of competence that interests you deeply,
p163
aVand focus on that.
p164
aa(lp165
VKeep in mind, then, Wilson's Second Principle:
p166
aVFor every scientist, whether researcher, technician,
p167
aVteacher, manager or businessman,
p168
aVworking at any level of mathematical competence,
p169
aVthere exists a discipline in science or medicine
p170
aVfor which that level is enough to achieve excellence.
p171
aa(lp172
VNow I'm going to offer quickly
p173
aVseveral more principles that will be useful
p174
aVin organizing your education and career,
p175
aVor if you're teaching, how you might
p176
aVenhance your own teaching and counseling of young scientists.
p177
aVIn selecting a subject in which to conduct original research,
p178
aVor to develop world-class expertise,
p179
aVtake a part of the chosen discipline that is sparsely inhabited.
p180
aVJudge opportunity by how few other students and researchers
p181
aVare on hand.
p182
aa(lp183
VThis is not to de-emphasize the essential requirement
p184
aVof broad training, or the value of apprenticing yourself
p185
aVin ongoing research to programs of high quality.
p186
aVIt is important also to acquire older mentors within these successful
p187
aVprograms, and to make friends and colleagues of your age
p188
aVfor mutual support.
p189
aVBut through it all, look for a way to break out,
p190
aVto find a field and subject not yet popular.
p191
aa(lp192
VWe have seen this demonstrated already in the talks preceding mine.
p193
aVThere is the quickest way advances are likely to occur,
p194
aVas measured in discoveries per investigator per year.
p195
aVYou may have heard the
p196
aVmilitary dictum for the gathering of armies:
p197
aVMarch to the sound of the guns.
p198
aVIn science, the exact opposite is the case: March away from the sound of the guns.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo Wilson's Principle Number Three:
p201
aVMarch away from the sound of the guns.
p202
aVObserve from a distance,
p203
aVbut do not join the fray.
p204
aVMake a fray of your own.
p205
aVOnce you have settled on a specialty,
p206
aVand the profession you can love, and you've secured opportunity,
p207
aVyour potential to succeed will be greatly enhanced if you study it
p208
aVenough to become an expert.
p209
aa(lp210
VThere are thousands of professionally delimited
p211
aVsubjects sprinkled through physics and chemistry
p212
aVto biology and medicine.
p213
aVAnd on then into the social sciences,
p214
aVwhere it is possible in short time to acquire
p215
aVthe status of an authority.
p216
aVWhen the subject is still very thinly populated,
p217
aVyou can with diligence and hard work become
p218
aVthe world authority.
p219
aa(lp220
VThe world needs this kind of expertise,
p221
aVand it rewards the kind of people
p222
aVwilling to acquire it.
p223
aVThe existing information and what you self-discover
p224
aVmay at first seem skimpy and difficult to connect
p225
aVto other bodies of knowledge.
p226
aVWell, if that's the case,
p227
aVgood. Why hard instead of easy?
p228
aa(lp229
VThe answer deserves to be stated as Principle Number Four.
p230
aVIn the attempt to make scientific discoveries,
p231
aVevery problem is an opportunity,
p232
aVand the more difficult the problem,
p233
aVthe greater will be the importance of its solution.
p234
aa(lp235
VNow this brings me to a basic categorization
p236
aVin the way scientific discoveries are made.
p237
aVScientists, pure mathematicians among them,
p238
aVfollow one or the other of two pathways:
p239
aVFirst through early discoveries,
p240
aVa problem is identified
p241
aVand a solution is sought.
p242
aVThe problem may be relatively small;
p243
aVfor example, where exactly in a cruise ship does the norovirus begin to spread?
p244
aVOr larger, what's the role of dark matter in the expansion of the universe?
p245
aVAs the answer is sought, other phenomena are typically discovered
p246
aVand other questions are asked.
p247
aa(lp248
VThis first of the two strategies is like a hunter,
p249
aVexploring a forest in search of a particular quarry,
p250
aVwho finds other quarries along the way.
p251
aVThe second strategy of research
p252
aVis to study a subject broadly
p253
aVsearching for unknown phenomena or patterns of known phenomena
p254
aVlike a hunter in what we call "the naturalist's trance,"
p255
aVthe researcher of mind is open to anything interesting,
p256
aVany quarry worth taking.
p257
aVThe search is not for the solution of the problem,
p258
aVbut for problems themselves worth solving.
p259
aa(lp260
VThe two strategies of research,
p261
aVoriginal research, can be stated as follows,
p262
aVin the final principle I'm going to offer you:
p263
aVFor every problem in a given discipline of science,
p264
aVthere exists a species or entity or phenomenon
p265
aVideal for its solution.
p266
aVAnd conversely, for every species or other entity
p267
aVor phenomenon, there exist important problems
p268
aVfor the solution of which, those particular objects of research are ideally suited.
p269
aVFind out what they are.
p270
aVYou'll find your own way to discover,
p271
aVto learn, to teach.
p272
aa(lp273
VThe decades ahead will see dramatic advances
p274
aVin disease prevention, general health, the quality of life.
p275
aVAll of humanity depends on the knowledge and practice of the medicine and the science
p276
aVbehind it you will master.
p277
aVYou have chosen a calling that will come in steps
p278
aVto give you satisfaction, at its conclusion, of a life well lived.
p279
aVAnd I thank you for having me here tonight.
p280
aa(lp281
V(Applause)
p282
aa(lp283
VOh, thank you.
p284
aVThank you very much.
p285
aVI salute you.
