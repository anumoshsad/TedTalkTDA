VThese are grim economic times,
p4
aVfellow TEDsters, grim economic times indeed.
p5
aVAnd so, I would like to cheer you up
p6
aVwith one of the great, albeit largely unknown,
p7
aVcommercial success stories
p8
aVof the past 20 years.
p9
aVComparable, in its own very peculiar way,
p10
aVto the achievements of Microsoft or Google.
p11
aVAnd it's an industry which has bucked the current recession
p12
aVwith equanimity.
p13
aVI refer to organized crime.
p14
aa(lp15
VNow organized crime has been around
p16
aVfor a very long time, I hear you say,
p17
aVand these would be wise words, indeed.
p18
aVBut in the last two decades,
p19
aVit has experienced an unprecedented expansion,
p20
aVnow accounting for roughly 15 percent
p21
aVof the world's GDP.
p22
aVI like to call it the Global Shadow Economy,
p23
aVor McMafia, for short.
p24
aa(lp25
VSo what triggered this extraordinary growth
p26
aVin cross-border crime?
p27
aVWell, of course, there is globalization,
p28
aVtechnology, communications, all that stuff,
p29
aVwhich we'll talk about a little bit later.
p30
aVBut first, I would like to take you back
p31
aVto this event:
p32
aVthe collapse of communism.
p33
aVAll across Eastern Europe, a most momentous episode
p34
aVin our post-war history.
p35
aa(lp36
VNow it's time for full disclosure.
p37
aVThis event meant a great deal to me personally.
p38
aVI had started smuggling books across the Iron Curtain
p39
aVto Democratic opposition groups in Eastern Europe,
p40
aVlike Solidarity in Poland,
p41
aVwhen I was in my teens.
p42
aVI then started writing about Eastern Europe,
p43
aVand eventually I became the BBC's chief correspondent for the region,
p44
aVwhich is what I was doing in 1989.
p45
aVAnd so when 425 million people
p46
aVfinally won the right
p47
aVto choose their own governments,
p48
aVI was ecstatic,
p49
aVbut I was also a touch worried
p50
aVabout some of the nastier things
p51
aVlurking behind the wall.
p52
aa(lp53
VIt wasn't long, for example,
p54
aVbefore ethnic nationalism
p55
aVreared its bloody head
p56
aVin Yugoslavia.
p57
aVAnd amongst the chaos,
p58
aVamidst the euphoria,
p59
aVit took me a little while to understand
p60
aVthat some of the people who had wielded power
p61
aVbefore 1989, in Eastern Europe,
p62
aVcontinued to do so after the revolutions there.
p63
aVObviously there were characters like this.
p64
aVBut there were also some more unexpected people
p65
aVwho played a critical role in what was going on in Eastern Europe.
p66
aa(lp67
VLike this character. Remember these guys?
p68
aVThey used to win the gold medals in weightlifting
p69
aVand wrestling, every four years in the Olympics,
p70
aVand they were the great celebrities of communism,
p71
aVwith a fabulous lifestyle to go with it.
p72
aVThey used to get great apartments in the center of town,
p73
aVcasual sex on tap,
p74
aVand they could travel to the West very freely,
p75
aVwhich was a great luxury at the time.
p76
aVIt may come as a surprise, but they played a critical role
p77
aVin the emergence of the market economy
p78
aVin Eastern Europe.
p79
aVOr as I like to call them, they are
p80
aVthe midwives of capitalism.
p81
aVHere are some of those same weightlifters
p82
aVafter their 1989 makeover.
p83
aa(lp84
VNow in Bulgaria \u2014
p85
aVthis photograph was taken in Bulgaria \u2014
p86
aVwhen communism collapsed all over Eastern Europe,
p87
aVit wasn't just communism;
p88
aVit was the state that collapsed as well.
p89
aVThat means your police force wasn't working.
p90
aVThe court system wasn't functioning properly.
p91
aVSo what was a business man in the brave new world
p92
aVof East European capitalism going to do
p93
aVto make sure that his contracts would be honored?
p94
aVWell, he would turn to people who were called, rather prosaically
p95
aVby sociologists, privatized law enforcement agencies.
p96
aVWe prefer to know them as the mafia.
p97
aVAnd in Bulgaria, the mafia was soon joined
p98
aVwith 14,000 people
p99
aVwho were sacked from their jobs in the security services
p100
aVbetween 1989 and 1991.
p101
aa(lp102
VNow, when your state is collapsing,
p103
aVyour economy is heading south at a rate of knots,
p104
aVthe last people you want coming on to the labor market
p105
aVare 14,000 men and women whose chief skills
p106
aVare surveillance,
p107
aVare smuggling, building underground networks
p108
aVand killing people.
p109
aVBut that's what happened all over Eastern Europe.
p110
aVNow, when I was working in the 1990s,
p111
aVI spent most of the time covering
p112
aVthe appalling conflict in Yugoslavia.
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd I couldn't help notice
p115
aVthat the people who were perpetrating the appalling atrocities,
p116
aVthe paramilitary organizations,
p117
aVwere actually the same people running
p118
aVthe organized criminal syndicates.
p119
aVAnd I came to think that behind the violence
p120
aVlay a sinister criminal enterprise.
p121
aVAnd so I resolved to travel around the world
p122
aVexamining this global criminal underworld
p123
aVby talking to policemen,
p124
aVby talking to victims, by talking to consumers
p125
aVof illicit goods and services.
p126
aVBut above all else, by talking to the gangsters themselves.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd the Balkans was a fabulous place to start.
p129
aVWhy? Well of course
p130
aVthere was the issue of law and order collapsing,
p131
aVbut also, as they say in the retail trade,
p132
aVit's location, location, location.
p133
aVAnd what I noticed at the beginning of my research
p134
aVthat the Balkans had turned into a vast transit zone
p135
aVfor illicit goods and services coming from all over the world.
p136
aVHeroin, cocaine,
p137
aVwomen being trafficked into prostitution
p138
aVand precious minerals.
p139
aa(lp140
VAnd where were they heading?
p141
aVThe European Union, which by now
p142
aVwas beginning to reap the benefits of globalization,
p143
aVtransforming it into
p144
aVthe most affluent consumer market in history,
p145
aVeventually comprising some 500 million people.
p146
aVAnd a significant minority
p147
aVof those 500 million people
p148
aVlike to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash
p149
aVsleeping with prostitutes,
p150
aVsticking 50 Euro notes up their nose
p151
aVand employing illegal migrant laborers.
p152
aa(lp153
VNow, organized crime in a globalizing world
p154
aVoperates in the same way as any other business.
p155
aVIt has zones of production,
p156
aVlike Afghanistan and Columbia.
p157
aVIt has zones of distribution,
p158
aVlike Mexico and the Balkans.
p159
aVAnd then, of course, it has zones of consumption,
p160
aVlike the European Union, Japan
p161
aVand of course, the United States.
p162
aVThe zones of production and distribution
p163
aVtend to lie in the developing world,
p164
aVand they are often threatened by appalling violence
p165
aVand bloodshed.
p166
aa(lp167
VTake Mexico, for example.
p168
aVSix thousand people killed there in the last 18 months
p169
aVas a direct consequence of the cocaine trade.
p170
aVBut what about the Democratic Republic of Congo?
p171
aVSince 1998, five million people have died there.
p172
aVIt's not a conflict you read about much in the newspapers,
p173
aVbut it's the biggest conflict on this planet
p174
aVsince the Second World War.
p175
aVAnd why is it? Because mafias from all around the world
p176
aVcooperate with local paramilitaries
p177
aVin order to seize the supplies
p178
aVof the rich mineral resources
p179
aVof the region.
p180
aa(lp181
VIn the year 2000, 80 percent of the world's coltan
p182
aVwas sourced to the killing fields
p183
aVof the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
p184
aVNow, coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone,
p185
aVin almost every laptop
p186
aVand games console.
p187
aVThe Congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia
p188
aVin exchange for weapons,
p189
aVand the mafia would then sell it on to Western markets.
p190
aVAnd it is this Western desire
p191
aVto consume
p192
aVthat is the primary driver
p193
aVof international organized crime.
p194
aa(lp195
VNow, let me show you some of my friends in action,
p196
aVcaught conveniently on film by the Italian police,
p197
aVand smuggling duty-not-paid cigarettes.
p198
aVNow, cigarettes out the factory gate are very cheap.
p199
aVThe European Union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world.
p200
aVSo if you can smuggle them into the E.U.,
p201
aVthere are very handsome profits to be made,
p202
aVand I want to show you this to demonstrate
p203
aVthe type of resources available to these groups.
p204
aa(lp205
VThis boat is worth one million Euros when it's new.
p206
aVAnd it's the fastest thing on European waters.
p207
aVFrom 1994, for seven years,
p208
aV20 of these boats
p209
aVmade the trip across the Adriatic,
p210
aVfrom Montenegro to Italy, every single night.
p211
aVAnd as a consequence of this trade,
p212
aVBritain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue.
p213
aVAnd instead that money went to underwrite the wars in Yugoslavia
p214
aVand line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals.
p215
aa(lp216
VNow Italian police, when this trade started,
p217
aVhad just two boats which could go at the same speed.
p218
aVAnd this is very important, because the only way you can catch these guys
p219
aVis if they run out of gas.
p220
aVSometimes the gangsters would bring with them
p221
aVwomen being trafficked into prostitution,
p222
aVand if the police intervened, they would hurl
p223
aVthe women into the sea
p224
aVso that the police had to go and save them from drowning,
p225
aVrather than chasing the bad guys.
p226
aa(lp227
VSo I have shown you this to demonstrate
p228
aVhow many boats, how many vessels it takes
p229
aVto catch one of these guys.
p230
aVAnd the answer is six vessels.
p231
aVAnd remember, 20 of these speed boats
p232
aVwere coming across the Adriatic
p233
aVevery single night.
p234
aVSo what were these guys doing with all the money they were making?
p235
aa(lp236
VWell, this is where we come to globalization,
p237
aVbecause that was not just the deregulation of global trade.
p238
aVIt was the liberalization of international financial markets.
p239
aVAnd boy, did that make it easy
p240
aVfor the money launderers.
p241
aVThe last two decades have been the champagne era
p242
aVfor dirty lucre.
p243
aa(lp244
VIn the 1990s, we saw financial centers around the world
p245
aVcompeting for their business,
p246
aVand there was simply no effective mechanism
p247
aVto prevent money laundering.
p248
aVAnd a lot of licit banks were also happy
p249
aVto accept deposits
p250
aVfrom very dubious sources
p251
aVwithout questions being asked.
p252
aa(lp253
VBut at the heart of this, is the offshore banking network.
p254
aVNow these things
p255
aVare an essential part of the money laundering parade,
p256
aVand if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion
p257
aVand transnational organized crime, money laundering,
p258
aVyou have to get rid of them.
p259
aVOn a positive note, we at last have someone in the White House
p260
aVwho has consistently spoken out
p261
aVagainst these corrosive entities.
p262
aa(lp263
VAnd if anyone is concerned about what I believe
p264
aVis the necessity for
p265
aVnew legislation, regulation, effective regulation,
p266
aVI say, let's take a look at Bernie Madoff,
p267
aVwho is now going to be spending the rest of his life in jail.
p268
aVBernie Madoff stole 65 billion dollars.
p269
aVThat puts him up there on the Olympus of gangsters
p270
aVwith the Colombian cartels
p271
aVand the major Russian crime syndicates,
p272
aVbut he did this for decades
p273
aVin the very heart of Wall Street,
p274
aVand no regulator picked up on it.
p275
aVSo how many other Madoffs are there on Wall Street
p276
aVor in the city of London,
p277
aVfleecing ordinary folk
p278
aVand money laundering?
p279
aVWell I can tell you, it's quite a few of them.
p280
aa(lp281
VLet me go on to the 101 of international organized crime now.
p282
aVAnd that is narcotics. Our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning.
p283
aVThis one, however, is in central British Columbia
p284
aVwhere I photographed it.
p285
aVIt's one of the tens of thousands
p286
aVof mom-and-pop grow-ops in B.C.
p287
aVwhich ensure that over five percent
p288
aVof the province's GDP is accounted for by this trade.
p289
aa(lp290
VNow, I was taken by inspector Brian Cantera,
p291
aVof the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
p292
aVto a cavernous warehouse east of Vancouver
p293
aVto see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated
p294
aVby the RCMP
p295
aVfrom the smugglers who are sending it,
p296
aVof course, down south to the United States
p297
aVwhere there is an insatiable market
p298
aVfor B.C. Bud, as it's called,
p299
aVin part because it's marketed as organic,
p300
aVwhich of course goes down very well in California.
p301
aV(Laughter)
p302
aV(Applause)
p303
aa(lp304
VNow, even by the police's admission,
p305
aVthis makes not a dent in the profits, really,
p306
aVof the major exporters.
p307
aVSince the beginning of globalization,
p308
aVthe global narcotics market has expanded enormously.
p309
aVThere has, however, been no concomitant increase
p310
aVin the resources available
p311
aVto police forces.
p312
aa(lp313
VThis, however, may all be about to change,
p314
aVbecause something very strange is going on.
p315
aVThe United Nations recognized
p316
aVearlier this \u2014 it was last month actually \u2014
p317
aVthat Canada has become a key area of distribution and production
p318
aVof ecstasy and other synthetic drugs.
p319
aa(lp320
VInterestingly, the market share
p321
aVof heroin and cocaine is going down,
p322
aVbecause the pills are getting ever better at reproducing their highs.
p323
aVNow that is a game changer,
p324
aVbecause it shifts production away from the developing world
p325
aVand into the Western world.
p326
aVWhen that happens, it is a trend
p327
aVwhich is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the West.
p328
aVThe drugs policy which we've had in place for 40 years
p329
aVis long overdue for a very serious rethink,
p330
aVin my opinion.
p331
aa(lp332
VNow, the recession.
p333
aVWell, organized crime has already adapted
p334
aVvery well to the recession.
p335
aVNot surprising, the most opportunistic industry
p336
aVin the whole world.
p337
aVAnd it has no rules to its regulatory system.
p338
aVExcept, of course, it has two business risks:
p339
aVarrest by law enforcement,
p340
aVwhich is, frankly, the least of their worries,
p341
aVand competition from other groups,
p342
aVi.e. a bullet in the back of the head.
p343
aa(lp344
VWhat they've done is they've shifted their operations.
p345
aVPeople don't smoke as much dope, or visit prostitutes quite so frequently
p346
aVduring a recession.
p347
aVAnd so instead, they have invaded financial
p348
aVand corporate crime in a big way,
p349
aVbut above all, two sectors,
p350
aVand that is counterfeit goods
p351
aVand cybercrime.
p352
aVAnd it's been terribly successful.
p353
aVI would like to introduce you to Mr. Pringle.
p354
aVOr perhaps I should say, more accurately, Señor Pringle.
p355
aa(lp356
VI was introduced to this bit of kit by a Brazilian cybercriminal.
p357
aVWe sat in a car on the Avenue Paulista
p358
aVin São Paulo, together.
p359
aVHooked it up to my laptop,
p360
aVand within about five minutes he had penetrated
p361
aVthe computer security system
p362
aVof a major Brazilian bank.
p363
aVIt's really not that difficult.
p364
aVAnd it's actually much easier because
p365
aVthe fascinating thing about cybercrime
p366
aVis that it's not so much the technology.
p367
aa(lp368
VThe key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering.
p369
aVOr to use the technical term for it,
p370
aVthere's one born every minute.
p371
aVYou would not believe how easy it is
p372
aVto persuade people to do things with their computers
p373
aVwhich are objectively not in their interest.
p374
aVAnd it was very soon
p375
aVwhen the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this,
p376
aVof course, the quickest way to a person's wallet
p377
aVis through the promise of sex and love.
p378
aa(lp379
VI expect some of you remember the ILOVEYOU virus,
p380
aVone of the very great worldwide viruses that came.
p381
aVI was very fortunate when the ILOVEYOU virus came out,
p382
aVbecause the first person I received it from
p383
aVwas an ex-girlfriend of mine.
p384
aVNow, she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time,
p385
aVbut love was not amongst them.
p386
aV(Laughter)
p387
aVAnd so as soon as I saw this drop into my inbox,
p388
aVI dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin
p389
aVand spared myself a very nasty infection.
p390
aa(lp391
VSo, cybercrime, do watch out for it.
p392
aVOne thing that we do know that the Internet is doing
p393
aVis the Internet is assisting these guys.
p394
aVThese are mosquitos who carry the malarial parasite
p395
aVwhich infests our blood when the mosy has had a free meal
p396
aVat our expense.
p397
aa(lp398
VNow, Artesunate is a very effective drug
p399
aVat destroying the parasite in the early days
p400
aVof infection.
p401
aVBut over the past year or so,
p402
aVresearchers in Cambodia have discovered
p403
aVthat what's happening is
p404
aVthe malarial parasite is developing a resistance.
p405
aVAnd they fear that the reason why it's developing a resistance
p406
aVis because Cambodians can't afford the drugs on the commercial market,
p407
aVand so they buy it from the Internet.
p408
aVAnd these pills contain only low doses
p409
aVof the active ingredient.
p410
aVWhich is why
p411
aVthe parasite is beginning to develop a resistance.
p412
aa(lp413
VThe reason I say this
p414
aVis because we have to know
p415
aVthat organized crime
p416
aVimpacts all sorts of areas of our lives.
p417
aVYou don't have to sleep with prostitutes
p418
aVor take drugs
p419
aVin order to have a relationship with organized crime.
p420
aVThey affect our bank accounts.
p421
aVThey affect our communications, our pension funds.
p422
aVThey even affect the food that we eat
p423
aVand our governments.
p424
aa(lp425
VThis is no longer an issue
p426
aVof Sicilians from Palermo and New York.
p427
aVThere is no romance involved with gangsters
p428
aVin the 21st Century.
p429
aVThis is a mighty industry,
p430
aVand it creates instability and violence
p431
aVwherever it goes.
p432
aVIt is a major economic force
p433
aVand we need to take it very, very seriously.
p434
aVIt's been a privilege talking to you.
p435
aVThank you very much.
