VToday I wanted to \u2014 well, this morning \u2014
p4
aVI want to talk about the future of human-driven transportation;
p5
aVabout how we can cut congestion, pollution and parking
p6
aVby getting more people into fewer cars;
p7
aVand how we can do it with the technology that's in our pockets.
p8
aVAnd yes, I'm talking about smartphones ...
p9
aVnot self-driving cars.
p10
aa(lp11
VBut to get started we've got to go back over 100 years.
p12
aVBecause it turns out there was an Uber way before Uber.
p13
aVAnd if it had survived,
p14
aVthe future of transportation would probably already be here.
p15
aa(lp16
VSo let me introduce you to the jitney.
p17
aVIn 1914 it was created or invented by a guy named LP Draper.
p18
aVHe was a car salesman from LA, and he had an idea.
p19
aVWell, he was cruising around downtown Los Angeles,
p20
aVmy hometown,
p21
aVand he saw trolleys
p22
aVwith long lines of people trying to get to where they wanted to go.
p23
aVHe said, well, why don't I just put a sign on my car
p24
aVthat takes people wherever they want to go for a jitney \u2014
p25
aVthat was slang for a nickel.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd so people jumped on board,
p28
aVand not just in Los Angeles but across the country.
p29
aVAnd within one year,
p30
aVby 1915,
p31
aVthere were 50,000 rides per day in Seattle,
p32
aV45,000 rides per day in Kansas
p33
aVand 150,000 rides per day in Los Angeles.
p34
aVTo give you some perspective,
p35
aVUber in Los Angeles
p36
aVis doing 157,000 rides per day, today ...
p37
aV100 years later.
p38
aa(lp39
VAnd so these are the trolley guys,
p40
aVthe existing transportation monopoly at the time.
p41
aVThey were clearly not happy about the jitney juggernaut.
p42
aVAnd so they got to work
p43
aVand they went to cities across the country
p44
aVand got regulations put in place to slow down the growth of the jitney.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd there were all kinds of regulations.
p47
aVThere were licenses \u2014 often they were pricey.
p48
aVIn some cities,
p49
aVif you were a jitney driver,
p50
aVyou were required to be in the jitney for 16 hours a day.
p51
aVIn other cities,
p52
aVthey required two jitney drivers for one jitney.
p53
aVBut there was a really interesting regulation
p54
aVwhich was they had to put a backseat light \u2014
p55
aVinstall it in every Jitney \u2014
p56
aVto stop a new pernicious innovation which they called spooning.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VAll right. So what happened?
p61
aVWell, within a year this thing had taken off.
p62
aVBut the jitney, by 1919, was regulated completely out of existence.
p63
aa(lp64
VThat's unfortunate ...
p65
aVbecause, well, when you can't share a car, then you have to own one.
p66
aVAnd car ownership skyrocketed
p67
aVand it's no wonder that by 2007,
p68
aVthere was a car for every man, woman and child in the United States.
p69
aVAnd that phenomenon had gone global.
p70
aVIn China by 2011,
p71
aVthere were more car sales happening in China than in the US.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, all this private ownership of course had a public cost.
p74
aVIn the US, we spend 7 billion hours a year,
p75
aVwasted, sitting in traffic.
p76
aV160 billion dollars in lost productivity,
p77
aVof course also sitting in traffic,
p78
aVand one-fifth of all of our carbon footprint
p79
aVis spewed out in the air by those cars that we're sitting in.
p80
aa(lp81
VNow, that's only four percent of our problem though.
p82
aVBecause if you have to own a car
p83
aVthen that means 96 percent of the time your car is sitting idle.
p84
aVAnd so, up to 30 percent of our land and our space
p85
aVis used storing these hunks of steel.
p86
aVWe even have skyscrapers built for cars.
p87
aVThat's the world we live in today.
p88
aa(lp89
VNow, cities have been dealing with this problem for decades.
p90
aVIt's called mass transit.
p91
aVAnd even in a city like New York City,
p92
aVone of the most densely populated in the world
p93
aVand one of the most sophisticated mass transit systems in the world,
p94
aVthere are still 2.5 million cars that go over those bridges every day.
p95
aVWhy is that?
p96
aVWell, it's because mass transit hasn't yet figured out
p97
aVhow to get to everybody's doorstep.
p98
aVAnd so back in San Francisco, where I live,
p99
aVthe situation's much worse,
p100
aVin fact, much worse around the world.
p101
aa(lp102
VAnd so the beginning of Uber in 2010 was \u2014
p103
aVwell, we just wanted to push a button and get a ride.
p104
aVWe didn't have any grand ambitions.
p105
aVBut it just turned out
p106
aVthat lots of people wanted to push a button and get a ride,
p107
aVand ultimately what we started to see was a lot of duplicate rides.
p108
aVWe saw a lot of people
p109
aVpushing the same button at the same time
p110
aVgoing essentially to the same place.
p111
aa(lp112
VAnd so we started thinking about,
p113
aVwell, how do we make those two trips and turn them into one.
p114
aVBecause if we did, that ride would be a lot cheaper \u2014
p115
aVup to 50 percent cheaper \u2014
p116
aVand of course for the city
p117
aVyou've got a lot more people and a lot fewer cars.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnd so the big question for us was:
p120
aVwould it work?
p121
aVCould you have a cheaper ride
p122
aVcheap enough that people would be willing to share it?
p123
aVAnd the answer, fortunately, is a resounding yes.
p124
aa(lp125
VIn San Francisco,
p126
aVbefore uberPOOL, we had \u2014
p127
aVwell, everybody would take their car wherever the heck they wanted.
p128
aVAnd the bright colors is where we have the most cars.
p129
aVAnd once we introduced uberPOOL,
p130
aVwell, you see there's not as many bright colors.
p131
aVMore people getting around the city in fewer cars,
p132
aVtaking cars off the road.
p133
aVIt looks like uberPOOL is working.
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd so we rolled it out in Los Angeles
p136
aVeight months ago.
p137
aVAnd since then, we've taken 7.9 million miles off the roads
p138
aVand we've taken 1.4 thousand metric tons of CO2 out of the air.
p139
aVBut the part that I'm really \u2014
p140
aa(lp141
V(Applause)
p142
aa(lp143
VBut my favorite statistic \u2014
p144
aVremember, I'm from LA,
p145
aVI spent years of my life
p146
aVsitting behind the wheel, going, "How do we fix this?" \u2014
p147
aVmy favorite part is that eight months later,
p148
aVwe have added 100,000 new people that are carpooling every week.
p149
aa(lp150
VNow, in China everything is supersized,
p151
aVand so we're doing 15 million uberPOOL trips per month,
p152
aVthat's 500,000 per day.
p153
aVAnd of course we're seeing that exponential growth happen.
p154
aVIn fact, we're seeing it in LA, too.
p155
aVAnd when I talk to my team, we don't talk about,
p156
aV"Hey, well, 100,000 people carpooling every week and we're done."
p157
aVHow do we get that to a million?
p158
aVAnd in China, well, that could be several million.
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd so uberPOOL is a very great solution for urban carpooling.
p161
aVBut what about the suburbs?
p162
aa(lp163
VThis is the street where I grew up in Los Angeles,
p164
aVit's actually a suburb called Northridge, California,
p165
aVand, well \u2014
p166
aVlook, those mailboxes, they kind of just go on forever.
p167
aVAnd every morning at about the same time,
p168
aVcars roll of out their driveway,
p169
aVmost of them, one person in the car,
p170
aVand they go to work, they go to their place of work.
p171
aVSo the question for us is:
p172
aVwell, how do we turn
p173
aVall of these commuter cars \u2014
p174
aVand literally there's tens of millions of them \u2014
p175
aVhow do we turn all these commuter cars into shared cars?
p176
aa(lp177
VWell, we have something for this that we recently launched called uberCOMMUTE.
p178
aVYou get up in the morning, get ready for work, get your coffee,
p179
aVgo to your car
p180
aVand you light up the Uber app,
p181
aVand all of a sudden,
p182
aVyou become an Uber driver.
p183
aVAnd we'll match you up with one of your neighbors
p184
aVon your way to work
p185
aVand it's a really great thing.
p186
aa(lp187
VThere's just one hitch ...
p188
aVit's called regulation.
p189
aVSo 54 cents a mile, what is that?
p190
aVWell, that is what the US government
p191
aVhas determined that the cost of owning a car is per mile.
p192
aVYou can pick up anybody in the United States
p193
aVand take them wherever they want to go at a moment's notice,
p194
aVfor 54 cents a mile or less.
p195
aVBut if you charge 60 cents a mile, you're a criminal.
p196
aVBut what if for 60 cents a mile
p197
aVwe could get half a million more people carpooling in Los Angeles?
p198
aVAnd what if at 60 cents a mile
p199
aVwe could get 50 million people carpooling in the United States?
p200
aVIf we could,
p201
aVit's obviously something we should do.
p202
aa(lp203
VAnd so it goes back to the lesson of the jitney.
p204
aVIf by 1915 this thing was taking off,
p205
aVimagine without the regulations that happened,
p206
aVif that thing could just keep going.
p207
aVHow would our cities be different today?
p208
aVWould we have parks in the place of parking lots?
p209
aVWell, we lost that chance.
p210
aVBut technology has given us another opportunity.
p211
aa(lp212
VNow, I'm as excited as anybody else about self-driving cars
p213
aVbut do we have to really wait five, 10 or even 20 years
p214
aVto make our new cities a reality?
p215
aVWith the technology in our pockets today,
p216
aVand a little smart regulation,
p217
aVwe can turn every car into a shared car,
p218
aVand we can reclaim our cities starting today.
p219
aa(lp220
VThank you.
p221
aa(lp222
V(Applause)
p223
aa(lp224
VChris Anderson: Travis, thank you.
p225
aa(lp226
VTravis Kalanick: Thank you.
p227
aa(lp228
VCA: You know \u2014 I mean the company you've built is absolutely astounding.
p229
aVYou only just talked about a small part of it here \u2014
p230
aVa powerful part \u2014
p231
aVthe idea of turning cars into public transport like that,
p232
aVit's cool.
p233
aVBut I've got a couple other questions
p234
aVbecause I know they're out there on people's minds.
p235
aa(lp236
VSo first of all, last week I think it was,
p237
aVI switched on my phone and tried to book an Uber
p238
aVand I couldn't find the app.
p239
aVYou had this very radical, very bold, brave redesign.
p240
aa(lp241
VTK: Sure.
p242
aa(lp243
VCA: How did it go?
p244
aVDid you notice other people not finding the app that day?
p245
aVAre you going to win people over for this redesign?
p246
aa(lp247
VTK: Well, first I should probably just say,
p248
aVwell, what we were trying to accomplish.
p249
aVAnd I think if you know a little bit about our history,
p250
aVit makes a lot more sense.
p251
aVWhich is, when we first got started,
p252
aVit was just black cars.
p253
aVIt was literally you push a button and get an S-Class.
p254
aVAnd so what we did
p255
aVwas almost what I would call an immature version of a luxury brand
p256
aVthat looked like a badge on a luxury car.
p257
aa(lp258
VAnd as we've gone worldwide
p259
aVand gone from S-Classes to auto rickshaws in India,
p260
aVit became something that was important for us
p261
aVto be more accessible,
p262
aVto be more hyperlocal,
p263
aVto be about the cities we were in
p264
aVand that's what you see with the patterns and colors.
p265
aVAnd to be more iconic,
p266
aVbecause a U doesn't mean anything in Sanskrit,
p267
aVand a U doesn't mean anything in Mandarin.
p268
aVAnd so that was a little bit what it was about.
p269
aa(lp270
VNow, when you first roll out something like that,
p271
aVI mean, your hands are sweating,
p272
aVyou've got \u2014
p273
aVyou know, you're a little worried.
p274
aVWhat we saw is a lot of people \u2014
p275
aVactually, at the beginning, we saw a lot more people opening the app
p276
aVbecause they were curious what they would find when they opened it.
p277
aVAnd our numbers were slightly up from what we expected.
p278
aa(lp279
VCA: OK, that's cool.
p280
aa(lp281
VNow, so you, yourself, are something of an enigma, I would say.
p282
aVYour supporters and investors, who have been with you the whole way,
p283
aVbelieve that the only chance
p284
aVof sort of taking on the powerful, entrenched interests
p285
aVof taxi industry and so forth,
p286
aVis to have someone who is a fierce, relentless competitor,
p287
aVwhich you've certainly proved to be.
p288
aa(lp289
VSome people feel you've almost taken that culture too far,
p290
aVand you know \u2014 like a year or two ago
p291
aVthere was a huge controversy where a lot of women got upset.
p292
aVHow did it feel like inside the company during that period?
p293
aVDid you notice a loss of business?
p294
aVDid you learn anything from that?
p295
aa(lp296
VTK: Well, look, I think \u2014
p297
aVI've been an entrepreneur since I've been in high school
p298
aVand you have \u2014
p299
aVIn various different ways an entrepreneur will see hard times
p300
aVand for us,
p301
aVit was about a year and a half ago,
p302
aVand for us it was hard times, too.
p303
aa(lp304
VNow, inside, we felt like \u2014
p305
aVI guess at the end of the day
p306
aVwe felt like we were good people doing good work,
p307
aVbut on the outside that wasn't evident.
p308
aVAnd so there was a lot that we had to do
p309
aVto sort of \u2014
p310
aVWe'd gone from a very small company \u2014
p311
aVI mean if you go literally two and a half years ago,
p312
aVour company was 400 people,
p313
aVand today it's 6,500.
p314
aVAnd so when you go through that growth,
p315
aVyou have to sort of cement your cultural values
p316
aVand talk about them all of the time.
p317
aVAnd make sure that people are constantly checking
p318
aVto say, "Are we good people doing good work?"
p319
aVAnd if you check those boxes,
p320
aVthe next part of that is making sure you're telling your story.
p321
aVAnd I think we learned a lot of lessons
p322
aVbut I think at the end of it we came out stronger.
p323
aVBut it was certainly a difficult period.
p324
aa(lp325
VCA: It seems to me, everywhere you turn,
p326
aVyou're facing people who occasionally give you a hard time.
p327
aVSome Uber drivers in New York and elsewhere
p328
aVare mad as hell now because you changed the fees
p329
aVand they can barely \u2014 they claim \u2014 barely afford the deal anymore.
p330
aa(lp331
VHow \u2014
p332
aVYou know, you said that you started this originally \u2014
p333
aVjust the coolness of pressing a button and summoning a ride.
p334
aVThis thing's taken off,
p335
aVyou're affecting the whole global economy, basically, at this point.
p336
aVYou're being forced to be, whether you want it or not,
p337
aVa kind of global visionary who's changing the world.
p338
aVI mean \u2014 who are you?
p339
aVDo you want that?
p340
aVAre you ready to go with that and be what that takes?
p341
aa(lp342
VTK: Well, there's a few things packed in that question, so \u2014
p343
aa(lp344
V(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
VFirst is on the pricing side \u2014
p347
aVI mean, keep in mind, right?
p348
aVUberX, when we first started,
p349
aVwas literally 10 or 15 percent cheaper than our black car product.
p350
aVIt's now
p351
aVin many cities, half the price of a taxi.
p352
aVAnd we have all the data to show
p353
aVthat the divers are making more per hour than they would as taxi drivers.
p354
aa(lp355
VWhat happens is when the price goes down,
p356
aVpeople are more likely to take Uber
p357
aVat different times of the day than they otherwise would have,
p358
aVand they're more likely to use it in places they wouldn't have before.
p359
aVAnd what that means for a driver is wherever he or she drops somebody off,
p360
aVthey're much more likely to get a pickup and get back in.
p361
aVAnd so what that means is more trips per hour,
p362
aVmore minutes of the hour where they're productive
p363
aVand actually, earnings come up.
p364
aa(lp365
VAnd we have cities where we've done literally five or six price cuts
p366
aVand have seen those price cuts go up over time.
p367
aVSo even in New York \u2014
p368
aVWe have a blog post we call "4 Septembers" \u2014
p369
aVcompare the earnings
p370
aVSeptember after September after September.
p371
aVSame month every year.
p372
aVAnd we see the earnings going up over time
p373
aVas the price comes down.
p374
aVAnd there's a perfect price point \u2014 you can't go down forever.
p375
aVAnd in those places where we bring the price down
p376
aVbut we don't see those earnings pop,
p377
aVwe bring the prices back up.
p378
aa(lp379
VSo that addresses that first part.
p380
aVAnd then the enigma and all of this \u2014
p381
aVI mean, the kind of entrepreneur I am
p382
aVis one that gets really excited about solving hard problems.
p383
aVAnd the way I like to describe it is it's kind of like a math professor.
p384
aVYou know? If a math professor doesn't have hard problems to solve,
p385
aVthat's a really sad math professor.
p386
aVAnd so at Uber we like the hard problems
p387
aVand we like getting excited about those and solving them.
p388
aVBut we don't want just any math problem,
p389
aVwe want the hardest ones that we can possibly find,
p390
aVand we want the one that if you solve it,
p391
aVthere's a little bit of a wow factor.
p392
aa(lp393
VCA: In a couple years' time \u2014
p394
aVsay five years' time, I don't know when \u2014
p395
aVyou roll out your incredible self-driving cars,
p396
aVat probably a lower cost than you currently pay for an Uber ride.
p397
aVWhat do you say to your army of a million drivers plus at that time?
p398
aa(lp399
VTK: Explain that again \u2014 at which time?
p400
aa(lp401
VCA: At the time when self-driving cars are coming \u2014
p402
aa(lp403
VTK: Sure, sure, sure. Sorry, I missed that.
p404
aa(lp405
VCA: What do you say to a driver?
p406
aVTK: Well, look, I think the first part is it's going to take \u2014
p407
aVit's likely going to take a lot longer
p408
aVthan I think some of the hype or media might expect.
p409
aVThat's part one.
p410
aa(lp411
VPart two is it's going to also take \u2014
p412
aVthere's going to be a long transition.
p413
aVThese cars will work in certain places and not in others.
p414
aa(lp415
VFor us it's an interesting challenge, right?
p416
aVBecause, well \u2014
p417
aVGoogle's been investing in this since 2007,
p418
aVTesla's going to be doing it, Apple's going to be doing it,
p419
aVthe manufacturers are going to be doing it.
p420
aVThis is a world that's going to exist, and for good reason.
p421
aVA million people die a year in cars.
p422
aVAnd we already looked at the billions or even trillions of hours worldwide
p423
aVthat people are spending sitting in them, driving frustrated, anxious.
p424
aVAnd think about the quality of life that improves
p425
aVwhen you give people their time back
p426
aVand it's not so anxiety-ridden.
p427
aVSo I think there's a lot of good.
p428
aa(lp429
VAnd so the way we think about it is that it's a challenge,
p430
aVbut one for optimistic leadership,
p431
aVWhere instead of resisting \u2014
p432
aVresisting technology,
p433
aVmaybe like the taxi industry, or the trolley industry \u2014
p434
aVwe have to embrace it or be a part of the future.
p435
aa(lp436
VBut how do we optimistically lead through it?
p437
aVAre there ways to partner with cities?
p438
aVAre there ways to have education systems, vocational training, etc.,
p439
aVfor that transition period.
p440
aVIt will take a lot longer than I think we all expect,
p441
