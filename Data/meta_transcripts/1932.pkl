VI'm going to talk to you tonight
p4
aVabout coming out of the closet,
p5
aVand not in the traditional sense,
p6
aVnot just the gay closet.
p7
aVI think we all have closets.
p8
aVYour closet may be telling someone
p9
aVyou love her for the first time,
p10
aVor telling someone that you're pregnant,
p11
aVor telling someone you have cancer,
p12
aVor any of the other hard conversations
p13
aVwe have throughout our lives.
p14
aVAll a closet is is a hard conversation,
p15
aVand although our topics may vary tremendously,
p16
aVthe experience of being in
p17
aVand coming out of the closet is universal.
p18
aVIt is scary, and we hate it, and it needs to be done.
p19
aa(lp20
VSeveral years ago,
p21
aVI was working at the South Side Walnut Cafe,
p22
aVa local diner in town,
p23
aVand during my time there I would go through phases
p24
aVof militant lesbian intensity:
p25
aVnot shaving my armpits,
p26
aVquoting Ani DiFranco lyrics as gospel.
p27
aVAnd depending on the bagginess of my cargo shorts
p28
aVand how recently I had shaved my head,
p29
aVthe question would often be sprung on me,
p30
aVusually by a little kid:
p31
aa(lp32
V"Um, are you a boy or are you a girl?"
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd there would be an awkward silence at the table.
p35
aVI'd clench my jaw a little tighter,
p36
aVhold my coffee pot with a little more vengeance.
p37
aVThe dad would awkwardly shuffle his newspaper
p38
aVand the mom would shoot a chilling stare at her kid.
p39
aVBut I would say nothing,
p40
aVand I would seethe inside.
p41
aVAnd it got to the point where every time I walked up
p42
aVto a table that had a kid anywhere between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
p43
aV(Laughter)
p44
aVAnd that is a terrible feeling.
p45
aVSo I promised myself, the next time, I would say something.
p46
aVI would have that hard conversation.
p47
aa(lp48
VSo within a matter of weeks, it happens again.
p49
aa(lp50
V"Are you a boy or are you a girl?"
p51
aa(lp52
VFamiliar silence, but this time I'm ready,
p53
aVand I am about to go all Women's Studies 101
p54
aVon this table. (Laughter)
p55
aVI've got my Betty Friedan quotes.
p56
aVI've got my Gloria Steinem quotes.
p57
aVI've even got this little bit from "Vagina Monologues" I'm going to do.
p58
aVSo I take a deep breath and I look down
p59
aVand staring back at me is a four-year-old girl in a pink dress,
p60
aVnot a challenge to a feminist duel,
p61
aVjust a kid with a question:
p62
aV"Are you a boy or are you a girl?"
p63
aa(lp64
VSo I take another deep breath,
p65
aVsquat down to next to her, and say,
p66
aV"Hey, I know it's kind of confusing.
p67
aVMy hair is short like a boy's,
p68
aVand I wear boy's clothes, but I'm a girl,
p69
aVand you know how sometimes you like to wear a pink dress,
p70
aVand sometimes you like to wear your comfy jammies?
p71
aVWell, I'm more of a comfy jammies kind of girl."
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd this kid looks me dead in the eye,
p74
aVwithout missing a beat, and says,
p75
aV"My favorite pajamas are purple with fish.
p76
aVCan I get a pancake, please?"
p77
aV(Laughter)
p78
aVAnd that was it. Just, "Oh, okay. You're a girl.
p79
aVHow about that pancake?"
p80
aa(lp81
VIt was the easiest hard conversation
p82
aVI have ever had.
p83
aVAnd why? Because Pancake Girl and I,
p84
aVwe were both real with each other.
p85
aa(lp86
VSo like many of us,
p87
aVI've lived in a few closets in my life, and yeah,
p88
aVmost often, my walls happened to be rainbow.
p89
aVBut inside, in the dark,
p90
aVyou can't tell what color the walls are.
p91
aVYou just know what it feels like to live in a closet.
p92
aVSo really, my closet is no different than yours
p93
aVor yours or yours.
p94
aVSure, I'll give you 100 reasons
p95
aVwhy coming out of my closet was harder than coming out of yours,
p96
aVbut here's the thing: Hard is not relative.
p97
aVHard is hard.
p98
aVWho can tell me that explaining to someone you've just declared bankruptcy
p99
aVis harder than telling someone you just cheated on them?
p100
aVWho can tell me that his coming out story
p101
aVis harder than telling your five-year-old  you're getting a divorce?
p102
aVThere is no harder, there is just hard.
p103
aVWe need to stop ranking our hard against everyone else's hard
p104
aVto make us feel better or worse about our closets
p105
aVand just commiserate on the  fact that we all have hard.
p106
aVAt some point in our lives, we all live in closets,
p107
aVand they may feel safe,
p108
aVor at least safer than what lies on the other side of that door.
p109
aVBut I am here to tell you,
p110
aVno matter what your walls are made of,
p111
aVa closet is no place for a person to live.
p112
aa(lp113
VThanks. (Applause)
p114
aa(lp115
VSo imagine yourself 20 years ago.
p116
aVMe, I had a ponytail, a strapless dress,
p117
aVand high-heeled shoes.
p118
aVI was not the militant lesbian
p119
aVready to fight any four-year-old that walked into the cafe.
p120
aVI was frozen by fear, curled up in the corner
p121
aVof my pitch-black closet
p122
aVclutching my gay grenade,
p123
aVand moving one muscle is the scariest thing
p124
aVI have ever done.
p125
aVMy family, my friends, complete strangers \u2014
p126
aVI had spent my entire life
p127
aVtrying to not disappoint these people,
p128
aVand now I was turning the world upside down
p129
aVon purpose.
p130
aVI was burning the pages of the script
p131
aVwe had all followed for so long,
p132
aVbut if you do not throw that grenade, it will kill you.
p133
aa(lp134
VOne of my most memorable grenade tosses
p135
aVwas at my sister's wedding.
p136
aV(Laughter)
p137
aVIt was the first time that many in attendance
p138
aVknew I was gay, so in doing  my maid of honor duties,
p139
aVin my black dress and heels,
p140
aVI walked around to tables
p141
aVand finally landed on a table of my parents' friends,
p142
aVfolks that had known me for years.
p143
aVAnd after a little small talk, one of the women shouted out,
p144
aV"I love Nathan Lane!"
p145
aVAnd the battle of gay relatability had begun.
p146
aa(lp147
V"Ash, have you ever been to the Castro?"
p148
aa(lp149
V"Well, yeah, actually, we have friends in San Francisco."
p150
aa(lp151
V"Well, we've never been there but we've heard it's fabulous."
p152
aa(lp153
V"Ash, do you know my hairdresser Antonio?
p154
aVHe's really good and he has never talked about a girlfriend."
p155
aa(lp156
V"Ash, what's your favorite TV show?
p157
aVOur favorite TV show? Favorite: Will & Grace.
p158
aVAnd you know who we love? Jack.
p159
aVJack is our favorite."
p160
aa(lp161
VAnd then one woman, stumped
p162
aVbut wanting so desperately to show her support,
p163
aVto let me know she was on my side,
p164
aVshe finally blurted out,
p165
aV"Well, sometimes my husband wears pink shirts."
p166
aV(Laughter)
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd I had a choice in that moment,
p169
aVas all grenade throwers do.
p170
aVI could go back to my girlfriend and my gay-loving table
p171
aVand mock their responses,
p172
aVchastise their unworldliness and their inability
p173
aVto jump through the politically correct  gay hoops I had brought with me,
p174
aVor I could empathize with them
p175
aVand realize that that was maybe one of the hardest things they had ever done,
p176
aVthat starting and having that conversation
p177
aVwas them coming out of their closets.
p178
aVSure, it would have been easy to point out where they felt short.
p179
aVIt's a lot harder to meet them where they are
p180
aVand acknowledge the fact that they were trying.
p181
aVAnd what else can you ask someone to do but try?
p182
aVIf you're going to be real with someone,
p183
aVyou gotta be ready for real in return.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo hard conversations are still not my strong suit.
p186
aVAsk anybody I have ever dated.
p187
aVBut I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call
p188
aVthe three Pancake Girl principles.
p189
aVNow, please view this through gay-colored lenses,
p190
aVbut know what it takes to come out of any closet
p191
aVis essentially the same.
p192
aa(lp193
VNumber one: Be authentic.
p194
aVTake the armor off. Be yourself.
p195
aVThat kid in the cafe had no armor,
p196
aVbut I was ready for battle.
p197
aVIf you want someone to be real with you,
p198
aVthey need to know that you bleed too.
p199
aa(lp200
VNumber two: Be direct. Just say it. Rip the Band-Aid off.
p201
aVIf you know you are gay, just say it.
p202
aVIf you tell your parents you might be gay,
p203
aVthey will hold out hope that this will change.
p204
aVDo not give them that sense of false hope.
p205
aV(Laughter)
p206
aa(lp207
VAnd number three, and most important \u2014
p208
aV(Laughter)
p209
aVBe unapologetic.
p210
aVYou are speaking your truth.
p211
aVNever apologize for that.
p212
aVAnd some folks may have gotten hurt along the way,
p213
aVso sure, apologize for what you've done,
p214
aVbut never apologize for who you are.
p215
aVAnd yeah, some folks may be disappointed,
p216
aVbut that is on them, not on you.
p217
aVThose are their expectations of who you are, not yours.
p218
aVThat is their story, not yours.
p219
aVThe only story that matters
p220
aVis the one that you want to write.
p221
aVSo the next time you find yourself
p222
aVin a pitch-black closet clutching your grenade,
p223
aVknow we have all been there before.
p224
aVAnd you may feel so very alone, but you are not.
p225
aVAnd we know it's hard but we need you out here,
p226
aVno matter what your walls are made of,
p227
aVbecause I guarantee you there are others
p228
aVpeering through the keyholes of their closets
p229
aVlooking for the next brave soul to bust a door open, so be that person
p230
aVand show the world that we are bigger than our closets
p231
aVand that a closet is no place for a person
p232
aVto truly live.
p233
aa(lp234
VThank you, Boulder. Enjoy your night. (Applause)
