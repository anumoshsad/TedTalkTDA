VSpeaking up is hard to do.
p4
aVI understood the true meaning of this phrase exactly one month ago,
p5
aVwhen my wife and I became new parents.
p6
aVIt was an amazing moment.
p7
aVIt was exhilarating and elating,
p8
aVbut it was also scary and terrifying.
p9
aVAnd it got particularly terrifying when we got home from the hospital,
p10
aVand we were unsure
p11
aVwhether our little baby boy was getting enough nutrients from breastfeeding.
p12
aVAnd we wanted to call our pediatrician,
p13
aVbut we also didn't want to make a bad first impression
p14
aVor come across as a crazy, neurotic parent.
p15
aVSo we worried.
p16
aVAnd we waited.
p17
aVWhen we got to the doctor's office the next day,
p18
aVshe immediately gave him formula because he was pretty dehydrated.
p19
aVOur son is fine now,
p20
aVand our doctor has reassured us we can always contact her.
p21
aVBut in that moment,
p22
aVI should've spoken up, but I didn't.
p23
aa(lp24
VBut sometimes we speak up when we shouldn't,
p25
aVand I learned that over 10 years ago when I let my twin brother down.
p26
aVMy twin brother is a documentary filmmaker,
p27
aVand for one of his first films,
p28
aVhe got an offer from a distribution company.
p29
aVHe was excited,
p30
aVand he was inclined to accept the offer.
p31
aVBut as a negotiations researcher,
p32
aVI insisted he make a counteroffer,
p33
aVand I helped him craft the perfect one.
p34
aVAnd it was perfect \u2014
p35
aVit was perfectly insulting.
p36
aVThe company was so offended,
p37
aVthey literally withdrew the offer
p38
aVand my brother was left with nothing.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd I've asked people all over the world about this dilemma of speaking up:
p41
aVwhen they can assert themselves,
p42
aVwhen they can push their interests,
p43
aVwhen they can express an opinion,
p44
aVwhen they can make an ambitious ask.
p45
aa(lp46
VAnd the range of stories are varied and diverse,
p47
aVbut they also make up a universal tapestry.
p48
aVCan I correct my boss when they make a mistake?
p49
aVCan I confront my coworker who keeps stepping on my toes?
p50
aVCan I challenge my friend's insensitive joke?
p51
aVCan I tell the person I love the most my deepest insecurities?
p52
aa(lp53
VAnd through these experiences, I've come to recognize
p54
aVthat each of us have something called a range of acceptable behavior.
p55
aVNow, sometimes we're too strong; we push ourselves too much.
p56
aVThat's what happened with my brother.
p57
aVEven making an offer was outside his range of acceptable behavior.
p58
aVBut sometimes we're too weak.
p59
aVThat's what happened with my wife and I.
p60
aVAnd this range of acceptable behaviors \u2014
p61
aVwhen we stay within our range, we're rewarded.
p62
aVWhen we step outside that range, we get punished in a variety of ways.
p63
aVWe get dismissed or demeaned or even ostracized.
p64
aVOr we lose that raise or that promotion or that deal.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, the first thing we need to know is:
p67
aVWhat is my range?
p68
aVBut the key thing is, our range isn't fixed;
p69
aVit's actually pretty dynamic.
p70
aVIt expands and it narrows based on the context.
p71
aVAnd there's one thing that determines that range more than anything else,
p72
aVand that's your power.
p73
aVYour power determines your range.
p74
aVWhat is power?
p75
aVPower comes in lots of forms.
p76
aVIn negotiations, it comes in the form of alternatives.
p77
aVSo my brother had no alternatives;
p78
aVhe lacked power.
p79
aVThe company had lots of alternatives;
p80
aVthey had power.
p81
aVSometimes it's being new to a country, like an immigrant,
p82
aVor new to an organization
p83
aVor new to an experience,
p84
aVlike my wife and I as new parents.
p85
aVSometimes it's at work,
p86
aVwhere someone's the boss and someone's the subordinate.
p87
aVSometimes it's in relationships,
p88
aVwhere one person's more invested than the other person.
p89
aa(lp90
VAnd the key thing is that when we have lots of power,
p91
aVour range is very wide.
p92
aVWe have a lot of leeway in how to behave.
p93
aVBut when we lack power, our range narrows.
p94
aVWe have very little leeway.
p95
aVThe problem is that when our range narrows,
p96
aVthat produces something called the low-power double bind.
p97
aVThe low-power double bind happens
p98
aVwhen, if we don't speak up, we go unnoticed,
p99
aVbut if we do speak up, we get punished.
p100
aa(lp101
VNow, many of you have heard the phrase the "double bind"
p102
aVand connected it with one thing, and that's gender.
p103
aVThe gender double bind is women who don't speak up go unnoticed,
p104
aVand women who do speak up get punished.
p105
aVAnd the key thing is that women have the same need as men to speak up,
p106
aVbut they have barriers to doing so.
p107
aVBut what my research has shown over the last two decades
p108
aVis that what looks like a gender difference
p109
aVis not really a gender double bind,
p110
aVit's a really a low-power double bind.
p111
aVAnd what looks like a gender difference
p112
aVare really often just power differences in disguise.
p113
aVOftentimes we see a difference between a man and a woman
p114
aVor men and women,
p115
aVand think, "Biological cause. There's something fundamentally different
p116
aVabout the sexes."
p117
aVBut in study after study,
p118
aVI've found that a better explanation for many sex differences
p119
aVis really power.
p120
aVAnd so it's the low-power double bind.
p121
aVAnd the low-power double bind means that we have a narrow range,
p122
aVand we lack power.
p123
aVWe have a narrow range,
p124
aVand our double bind is very large.
p125
aa(lp126
VSo we need to find ways to expand our range.
p127
aVAnd over the last couple decades,
p128
aVmy colleagues and I have found two things really matter.
p129
aVThe first: you seem powerful in your own eyes.
p130
aVThe second: you seem powerful in the eyes of others.
p131
aVWhen I feel powerful,
p132
aVI feel confident, not fearful;
p133
aVI expand my own range.
p134
aVWhen other people see me as powerful,
p135
aVthey grant me a wider range.
p136
aVSo we need tools to expand our range of acceptable behavior.
p137
aVAnd I'm going to give you a set of tools today.
p138
aVSpeaking up is risky,
p139
aVbut these tools will lower your risk of speaking up.
p140
aa(lp141
VThe first tool I'm going to give you got discovered in negotiations
p142
aVin an important finding.
p143
aVOn average, women make less ambitious offers
p144
aVand get worse outcomes than men at the bargaining table.
p145
aVBut Hannah Riley Bowles and Emily Amanatullah have discovered
p146
aVthere's one situation where women get the same outcomes as men
p147
aVand are just as ambitious.
p148
aVThat's when they advocate for others.
p149
aVWhen they advocate for others,
p150
aVthey discover their own range and expand it in their own mind.
p151
aVThey become more assertive.
p152
aVThis is sometimes called "the mama bear effect."
p153
aVLike a mama bear defending her cubs,
p154
aVwhen we advocate for others, we can discover our own voice.
p155
aa(lp156
VBut sometimes, we have to advocate for ourselves.
p157
aVHow do we do that?
p158
aVOne of the most important tools we have to advocate for ourselves
p159
aVis something called perspective-taking.
p160
aVAnd perspective-taking is really simple:
p161
aVit's simply looking at the world through the eyes of another person.
p162
aVIt's one of the most important tools we have to expand our range.
p163
aVWhen I take your perspective,
p164
aVand I think about what you really want,
p165
aVyou're more likely to give me what I really want.
p166
aa(lp167
VBut here's the problem:
p168
aVperspective-taking is hard to do.
p169
aVSo let's do a little experiment.
p170
aVI want you all to hold your hand just like this:
p171
aVyour finger \u2014 put it up.
p172
aVAnd I want you to draw a capital letter E on your forehead
p173
aVas quickly as possible.
p174
aVOK, it turns out that we can draw this E in one of two ways,
p175
aVand this was originally designed as a test of perspective-taking.
p176
aVI'm going to show you two pictures
p177
aVof someone with an E on their forehead \u2014
p178
aVmy former student, Erika Hall.
p179
aVAnd you can see over here,
p180
aVthat's the correct E.
p181
aVI drew the E so it looks like an E to another person.
p182
aVThat's the perspective-taking E
p183
aVbecause it looks like an E from someone else's vantage point.
p184
aVBut this E over here is the self-focused E.
p185
aVWe often get self-focused.
p186
aVAnd we particularly get self-focused in a crisis.
p187
aa(lp188
VI want to tell you about a particular crisis.
p189
aVA man walks into a bank in Watsonville, California.
p190
aVAnd he says, "Give me $2,000,
p191
aVor I'm blowing the whole bank up with a bomb."
p192
aVNow, the bank manager didn't give him the money.
p193
aVShe took a step back.
p194
aVShe took his perspective,
p195
aVand she noticed something really important.
p196
aVHe asked for a specific amount of money.
p197
aa(lp198
VSo she said,
p199
aV"Why did you ask for $2,000?"
p200
aa(lp201
VAnd he said, "My friend is going to be evicted
p202
aVunless I get him $2,000 immediately."
p203
aa(lp204
VAnd she said, "Oh! You don't want to rob the bank \u2014
p205
aVyou want to take out a loan."
p206
aa(lp207
V(Laughter)
p208
aa(lp209
V"Why don't you come back to my office,
p210
aVand we can have you fill out the paperwork."
p211
aa(lp212
V(Laughter)
p213
aa(lp214
VNow, her quick perspective-taking defused a volatile situation.
p215
aVSo when we take someone's perspective,
p216
aVit allows us to be ambitious and assertive, but still be likable.
p217
aa(lp218
VHere's another way to be assertive but still be likable,
p219
aVand that is to signal flexibility.
p220
aVNow, imagine you're a car salesperson, and you want to sell someone a car.
p221
aVYou're going to more likely make the sale if you give them two options.
p222
aVLet's say option A:
p223
aV$24,000 for this car and a five-year warranty.
p224
aVOr option B:
p225
aV$23,000 and a three-year warranty.
p226
aVMy research shows that when you give people a choice among options,
p227
aVit lowers their defenses,
p228
aVand they're more likely to accept your offer.
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd this doesn't just work with salespeople;
p231
aVit works with parents.
p232
aVWhen my niece was four,
p233
aVshe resisted getting dressed and rejected everything.
p234
aVBut then my sister-in-law had a brilliant idea.
p235
aVWhat if I gave my daughter a choice?
p236
aVThis shirt or that shirt? OK, that shirt.
p237
aVThis pant or that pant? OK, that pant.
p238
aVAnd it worked brilliantly.
p239
aVShe got dressed quickly and without resistance.
p240
aa(lp241
VWhen I've asked the question around the world
p242
aVwhen people feel comfortable speaking up,
p243
aVthe number one answer is:
p244
aV"When I have social support in my audience; when I have allies."
p245
aVSo we want to get allies on our side.
p246
aVHow do we do that?
p247
aVWell, one of the ways is be a mama bear.
p248
aVWhen we advocate for others,
p249
aVwe expand our range in our own eyes and the eyes of others,
p250
aVbut we also earn strong allies.
p251
aa(lp252
VAnother way we can earn strong allies, especially in high places,
p253
aVis by asking other people for advice.
p254
aVWhen we ask others for advice, they like us because we flatter them,
p255
aVand we're expressing humility.
p256
aVAnd this really works to solve another double bind.
p257
aVAnd that's the self-promotion double bind.
p258
aVThe self-promotion double bind
p259
aVis that if we don't advertise our accomplishments,
p260
aVno one notices.
p261
aVAnd if we do, we're not likable.
p262
aa(lp263
VBut if we ask for advice about one of our accomplishments,
p264
aVwe are able to be competent in their eyes but also be likeable.
p265
aVAnd this is so powerful
p266
aVit even works when you see it coming.
p267
aVThere have been multiple times in life when I have been forewarned
p268
aVthat a low-power person has been given the advice to come ask me for advice.
p269
aVI want you to notice three things about this:
p270
aVFirst, I knew they were going to come ask me for advice.
p271
aVTwo, I've actually done research on the strategic benefits
p272
aVof asking for advice.
p273
aVAnd three, it still worked!
p274
aVI took their perspective,
p275
aVI became more invested in their cause,
p276
aVI became more committed to them because they asked for advice.
p277
aa(lp278
VNow, another time we feel more confident speaking up
p279
aVis when we have expertise.
p280
aVExpertise gives us credibility.
p281
aVWhen we have high power, we already have credibility.
p282
aVWe only need good evidence.
p283
aVWhen we lack power, we don't have the credibility.
p284
aVWe need excellent evidence.
p285
aa(lp286
VAnd one of the ways we can come across as an expert
p287
aVis by tapping into our passion.
p288
aVI want everyone in the next few days to go up to friend of theirs
p289
aVand just say to them,
p290
aV"I want you to describe a passion of yours to me."
p291
aVI've had people do this all over the world
p292
aVand I asked them,
p293
aV"What did you notice about the other person
p294
aVwhen they described their passion?"
p295
aVAnd the answers are always the same.
p296
aV"Their eyes lit up and got big."
p297
aV"They smiled a big beaming smile."
p298
aV"They used their hands all over \u2014
p299
aVI had to duck because their hands were coming at me."
p300
aV"They talk quickly with a little higher pitch."
p301
aa(lp302
V(Laughter)
p303
aa(lp304
V"They leaned in as if telling me a secret."
p305
aa(lp306
VAnd then I said to them,
p307
aV"What happened to you as you listened to their passion?"
p308
aa(lp309
VThey said, "My eyes lit up.
p310
aVI smiled.
p311
aVI leaned in."
p312
aa(lp313
VWhen we tap into our passion,
p314
aVwe give ourselves the courage, in our own eyes, to speak up,
p315
aVbut we also get the permission from others to speak up.
p316
aVTapping into our passion even works when we come across as too weak.
p317
aVBoth men and women get punished at work when they shed tears.
p318
aVBut Lizzie Wolf has shown that when we frame our strong emotions as passion,
p319
aVthe condemnation of our crying disappears for both men and women.
p320
aa(lp321
VI want to end with a few words from my late father
p322
aVthat he spoke at my twin brother's wedding.
p323
aVHere's a picture of us.
p324
aVMy dad was a psychologist like me,
p325
aVbut his real love and his real passion was cinema,
p326
aVlike my brother.
p327
aVAnd so he wrote a speech for my brother's wedding
p328
aVabout the roles we play in the human comedy.
p329
aa(lp330
VAnd he said, "The lighter your touch,
p331
aVthe better you become at improving and enriching your performance.
p332
aVThose who embrace their roles and work to improve their performance
p333
aVgrow, change and expand the self.
p334
aVPlay it well,
p335
aVand your days will be mostly joyful."
p336
aa(lp337
VWhat my dad was saying
p338
aVis that we've all been assigned ranges and roles in this world.
p339
aVBut he was also saying the essence of this talk:
p340
aVthose roles and ranges are constantly expanding and evolving.
p341
aa(lp342
VSo when a scene calls for it,
p343
aVbe a ferocious mama bear
p344
aVand a humble advice seeker.
p345
aVHave excellent evidence and strong allies.
p346
aVBe a passionate perspective taker.
p347
aVAnd if you use those tools \u2014
p348
aVand each and every one of you can use these tools \u2014
p349
aVyou will expand your range of acceptable behavior,
p350
aVand your days will be mostly joyful.
p351
aa(lp352
VThank you.
