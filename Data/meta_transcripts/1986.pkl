VThe Olympic motto is "Citius, Altius, Fortius."
p4
aVFaster, Higher, Stronger.
p5
aVAnd athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly.
p6
aVThe winner of the 2012 Olympic marathon
p7
aVran two hours and eight minutes.
p8
aVHad he been racing against the winner
p9
aVof the 1904 Olympic marathon,
p10
aVhe would have won by nearly an hour and a half.
p11
aVNow we all have this feeling
p12
aVthat we're somehow just getting better
p13
aVas a human race, inexorably progressing,
p14
aVbut it's not like we've evolved into a new species
p15
aVin a century.
p16
aVSo what's going on here?
p17
aVI want to take a look at what's really behind
p18
aVthis march of athletic progress.
p19
aa(lp20
VIn 1936, Jesse Owens
p21
aVheld the world record in the 100 meters.
p22
aVHad Jesse Owens been racing last year
p23
aVin the world championships of the 100 meters,
p24
aVwhen Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt finished,
p25
aVOwens would have still had 14 feet to go.
p26
aVThat's a lot in sprinter land.
p27
aVTo give you a sense of how much it is,
p28
aVI want to share with you a demonstration
p29
aVconceived by sports scientist Ross Tucker.
p30
aVNow picture the stadium last year
p31
aVat the world championships of the 100 meters:
p32
aVthousands of fans waiting with baited breath
p33
aVto see Usain Bolt, the fastest man in history;
p34
aVflashbulbs popping as the nine fastest men in the world
p35
aVcoil themselves into their blocks.
p36
aVAnd I want you to pretend
p37
aVthat Jesse Owens is in that race.
p38
aVNow close your eyes for a second and picture the race.
p39
aVBang! The gun goes off.
p40
aVAn American sprinter jumps out to the front.
p41
aVUsain Bolt starts to catch him.
p42
aVUsain Bolt passes him, and as the runners come to the finish,
p43
aVyou'll hear a beep as each man crosses the line.
p44
aV(Beeps)
p45
aVThat's the entire finish of the race.
p46
aVYou can open your eyes now.
p47
aVThat first beep was Usain Bolt.
p48
aVThat last beep was Jesse Owens.
p49
aVListen to it again.
p50
aV(Beeps)
p51
aVWhen you think of it like that,
p52
aVit's not that big a difference, is it?
p53
aVAnd then consider that Usain Bolt started
p54
aVby propelling himself out of blocks
p55
aVdown a specially fabricated carpet
p56
aVdesigned to allow him to travel
p57
aVas fast as humanly possible.
p58
aVJesse Owens, on the other hand,
p59
aVran on cinders, the ash from burnt wood,
p60
aVand that soft surface stole far more energy
p61
aVfrom his legs as he ran.
p62
aVRather than blocks, Jesse Owens had a gardening trowel
p63
aVthat he had to use to dig holes in the cinders to start from.
p64
aVBiomechanical analysis of the speed
p65
aVof Owens' joints shows that had been running
p66
aVon the same surface as Bolt,
p67
aVhe wouldn't have been 14 feet behind,
p68
aVhe would have been within one stride.
p69
aVRather than the last beep,
p70
aVOwens would have been the second beep.
p71
aVListen to it again.
p72
aV(Beeps)
p73
aVThat's the difference track surface technology has made,
p74
aVand it's done it throughout the running world.
p75
aa(lp76
VConsider a longer event.
p77
aVIn 1954, Sir Roger Bannister
p78
aVbecame the first man to run under four minutes in the mile.
p79
aVNowadays, college kids do that every year.
p80
aVOn rare occasions, a high school kid does it.
p81
aVAs of the end of last year,
p82
aV1,314 men
p83
aVhad run under four minutes in the mile,
p84
aVbut like Jesse Owens,
p85
aVSir Roger Bannister ran on soft cinders
p86
aVthat stole far more energy from his legs
p87
aVthan the synthetic tracks of today.
p88
aVSo I consulted biomechanics experts
p89
aVto find out how much slower it is to run on cinders
p90
aVthan synthetic tracks,
p91
aVand their consensus that it's one and a half percent slower.
p92
aVSo if you apply a one and a half percent slowdown conversion
p93
aVto every man who ran his sub-four mile
p94
aVon a synthetic track,
p95
aVthis is what happens.
p96
aVOnly 530 are left.
p97
aVIf you look at it from that perspective,
p98
aVfewer than ten new men per [year]
p99
aVhave joined the sub-four mile club
p100
aVsince Sir Roger Bannister.
p101
aVNow, 530 is a lot more than one,
p102
aVand that's partly because there are many more people
p103
aVtraining today and they're training more intelligently.
p104
aVEven college kids are professional in their training
p105
aVcompared to Sir Roger Bannister,
p106
aVwho trained for 45 minutes at a time
p107
aVwhile he ditched gynecology lectures in med school.
p108
aVAnd that guy who won the 1904 Olympic marathon
p109
aVin three in a half hours,
p110
aVthat guy was drinking rat poison and brandy
p111
aVwhile he ran along the course.
p112
aVThat was his idea of a performance-enhancing drug.
p113
aV(Laughter)
p114
aa(lp115
VClearly, athletes have gotten more savvy
p116
aVabout performance-enhancing drugs as well,
p117
aVand that's made a difference in some sports at some times,
p118
aVbut technology has made a difference in all sports,
p119
aVfrom faster skis to lighter shoes.
p120
aVTake a look at the record for the 100-meter freestyle swim.
p121
aVThe record is always trending downward,
p122
aVbut it's punctuated by these steep cliffs.
p123
aVThis first cliff, in 1956, is the introduction
p124
aVof the flip turn.
p125
aVRather than stopping and turning around,
p126
aVathletes could somersault under the water
p127
aVand get going right away in the opposite direction.
p128
aVThis second cliff, the introduction of gutters
p129
aVon the side of the pool
p130
aVthat allows water to splash off,
p131
aVrather than becoming turbulence
p132
aVthat impedes the swimmers as they race.
p133
aVThis final cliff,
p134
aVthe introduction of full-body
p135
aVand low-friction swimsuits.
p136
aa(lp137
VThroughout sports, technology has changed the face of performance.
p138
aVIn 1972, Eddy Merckx set the record
p139
aVfor the longest distance cycled in one hour
p140
aVat 30 miles, 3,774 feet.
p141
aVNow that record improved and improved
p142
aVas bicycles improved and became more aerodynamic
p143
aVall the way until 1996,
p144
aVwhen it was set at 35 miles, 1,531 feet,
p145
aVnearly five miles farther
p146
aVthan Eddy Merckx cycled in 1972.
p147
aVBut then in 2000, the International Cycling Union
p148
aVdecreed that anyone who wanted to hold that record
p149
aVhad to do so with essentially the same equipment
p150
aVthat Eddy Merckx used in 1972.
p151
aVWhere does the record stand today?
p152
aV30 miles, 4,657 feet,
p153
aVa grand total of 883 feet
p154
aVfarther than Eddy Merckx cycled
p155
aVmore than four decades ago.
p156
aVEssentially the entire improvement in this record
p157
aVwas due to technology.
p158
aa(lp159
VStill, technology isn't the only thing pushing athletes forward.
p160
aVWhile indeed we haven't evolved
p161
aVinto a new species in a century,
p162
aVthe gene pool within competitive sports
p163
aVmost certainly has changed.
p164
aVIn the early half of the 20th century,
p165
aVphysical education instructors and coaches
p166
aVhad the idea that the average body type
p167
aVwas the best for all athletic endeavors:
p168
aVmedium height, medium weight, no matter the sport.
p169
aVAnd this showed in athletes' bodies.
p170
aVIn the 1920s, the average elite high-jumper
p171
aVand average elite shot-putter were the same exact size.
p172
aVBut as that idea started to fade away,
p173
aVas sports scientists and coaches realized that
p174
aVrather than the average body type,
p175
aVyou want highly specialized bodies
p176
aVthat fit into certain athletic niches,
p177
aVa form of artificial selection took place,
p178
aVa self-sorting for bodies that fit certain sports,
p179
aVand athletes' bodies became more different from one another.
p180
aVToday, rather than the same size as the average elite high jumper,
p181
aVthe average elite shot-putter
p182
aVis two and a half inches taller
p183
aVand 130 pounds heavier.
p184
aVAnd this happened throughout the sports world.
p185
aa(lp186
VIn fact, if you plot on a height versus mass graph
p187
aVone data point for each of two dozen sports
p188
aVin the first half of the 20th century, it looks like this.
p189
aVThere's some dispersal,
p190
aVbut it's kind of grouped around that average body type.
p191
aVThen that idea started to go away,
p192
aVand at the same time, digital technology \u2014
p193
aVfirst radio, then television and the Internet \u2014
p194
aVgave millions, or in some cases billions, of people
p195
aVa ticket to consume elite sports performance.
p196
aVThe financial incentives and fame and glory afforded elite athletes skyrocketed,
p197
aVand it tipped toward the tiny upper echelon of performance.
p198
aVIt accelerated the artificial selection for specialized bodies.
p199
aVAnd if you plot a data point for these same
p200
aVtwo dozen sports today, it looks like this.
p201
aVThe athletes' bodies have gotten
p202
aVmuch more different from one another.
p203
aVAnd because this chart looks like the charts
p204
aVthat show the expanding universe,
p205
aVwith the galaxies flying away from one another,
p206
aVthe scientists who discovered it call it
p207
aV"The Big Bang of Body Types."
p208
aa(lp209
VIn sports where height is prized, like basketball,
p210
aVthe tall athletes got taller.
p211
aVIn 1983, the National Basketball Association
p212
aVsigned a groundbreaking agreement
p213
aVmaking players partners in the league,
p214
aVentitled to shares of ticket revenues
p215
aVand television contracts.
p216
aVSuddenly, anybody who could be an NBA player
p217
aVwanted to be,
p218
aVand teams started scouring the globe
p219
aVfor the bodies that could help them win championships.
p220
aVAlmost overnight,
p221
aVthe proportion of men in the NBA
p222
aVwho are at least seven feet tall doubled
p223
aVto 10 percent.
p224
aVToday, one in 10 men in the NBA
p225
aVis at least seven feet tall,
p226
aVbut a seven-foot-tall man is incredibly rare
p227
aVin the general population \u2014
p228
aVso rare that if you know an American man
p229
aVbetween the ages of 20 and 40
p230
aVwho is at least seven feet tall,
p231
aVthere's a 17 percent chance
p232
aVhe's in the NBA right now.
p233
aV(Laughter)
p234
aVThat is, find six honest seven footers,
p235
aVone is in the NBA right now.
p236
aVAnd that's not the only way that NBA players' bodies are unique.
p237
aVThis is Leonardo da Vinci's "Vitruvian Man,"
p238
aVthe ideal proportions,
p239
aVwith arm span equal to height.
p240
aVMy arm span is exactly equal to my height.
p241
aVYours is probably very nearly so.
p242
aVBut not the average NBA player.
p243
aVThe average NBA player is a shade under 6'7",
p244
aVwith arms that are seven feet long.
p245
aVNot only are NBA players ridiculously tall,
p246
aVthey are ludicrously long.
p247
aVHad Leonardo wanted to draw
p248
aVthe Vitruvian NBA Player,
p249
aVhe would have needed a rectangle and an ellipse,
p250
aVnot a circle and a square.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo in sports where large size is prized,
p253
aVthe large athletes have gotten larger.
p254
aVConversely, in sports where diminutive stature is an advantage,
p255
aVthe small athletes got smaller.
p256
aVThe average elite female gymnast
p257
aVshrunk from 5'3" to 4'9" on average
p258
aVover the last 30 years,
p259
aVall the better for their power-to-weight ratio
p260
aVand for spinning in the air.
p261
aVAnd while the large got larger
p262
aVand the small got smaller,
p263
aVthe weird got weirder.
p264
aVThe average length of the forearm
p265
aVof a water polo player in relation
p266
aVto their total arm got longer,
p267
aVall the better for a forceful throwing whip.
p268
aVAnd as the large got larger,
p269
aVsmall got smaller, and the weird weirder.
p270
aVIn swimming, the ideal body type
p271
aVis a long torso and short legs.
p272
aVIt's like the long hull of a canoe
p273
aVfor speed over the water.
p274
aVAnd the opposite is advantageous in running.
p275
aVYou want long legs and a short torso.
p276
aVAnd this shows in athletes' bodies today.
p277
aVHere you see Michael Phelps,
p278
aVthe greatest swimmer in history,
p279
aVstanding next to Hicham El Guerrouj,
p280
aVthe world record holder in the mile.
p281
aVThese men are seven inches different in height,
p282
aVbut because of the body types
p283
aVadvantaged in their sports,
p284
aVthey wear the same length pants.
p285
aVSeven inches difference in height,
p286
aVthese men have the same length legs.
p287
aa(lp288
VNow in some cases, the search for bodies
p289
aVthat could push athletic performance forward
p290
aVended up introducing into the competitive world
p291
aVpopulations of people that weren't previously competing at all,
p292
aVlike Kenyan distance runners.
p293
aVWe think of Kenyans as being great marathoners.
p294
aVKenyans think of the Kalenjin tribe
p295
aVas being great marathoners.
p296
aVThe Kalenjin make up just 12 percent
p297
aVof the Kenyan population
p298
aVbut the vast majority of elite runners.
p299
aVAnd they happen, on average,
p300
aVto have a certain unique physiology:
p301
aVlegs that are very long
p302
aVand very thin at their extremity,
p303
aVand this is because they have their ancestry
p304
aVat very low latitude
p305
aVin a very hot and dry climate,
p306
aVand an evolutionary adaptation to that
p307
aVis limbs that are very long
p308
aVand very thin at the extremity
p309
aVfor cooling purposes.
p310
aVIt's the same reason that a radiator has long coils,
p311
aVto increase surface area compared to volume
p312
aVto let heat out,
p313
aVand because the leg is like a pendulum,
p314
aVthe longer and thinner it is at the extremity,
p315
aVthe more energy-efficient it is to swing.
p316
aVTo put Kalenjin running success in perspective,
p317
aVconsider that 17 American men in history
p318
aVhave run faster than two hours and 10 minutes
p319
aVin the marathon.
p320
aVThat's a four-minute-and-58-second-per-mile pace.
p321
aVThirty-two Kalenjin men did that last October.
p322
aV(Laughter)
p323
aVThat's from a source population the size
p324
aVof metropolitan Atlanta.
p325
aa(lp326
VStill, even changing technology
p327
aVand the changing gene pool in sports
p328
aVdon't account for all of the changes in performance.
p329
aVAthletes have a different mindset than they once did.
p330
aVHave you ever seen in a movie when someone gets
p331
aVan electrical shock
p332
aVand they're thrown across a room?
p333
aVThere's no explosion there.
p334
aVWhat's happening when that happens is that
p335
aVthe electrical impulse is causing
p336
aVall their muscle fibers to twitch at once,
p337
aVand they're throwing themselves across the room.
p338
aVThey're essentially jumping.
p339
aVThat's the power
p340
aVthat's contained in the human body.
p341
aVBut normally we can't access nearly all of it.
p342
aVOur brain acts as a limiter,
p343
aVpreventing us from accessing all of our physical resources,
p344
aVbecause we might hurt ourselves,
p345
aVtearing tendons or ligaments.
p346
aVBut the more we learn about how that limiter functions,
p347
aVthe more we learn how we can push it back
p348
aVjust a bit,
p349
aVin some cases by convincing the brain
p350
aVthat the body won't be in mortal danger
p351
aVby pushing harder.
p352
aVEndurance and ultra-endurance sports
p353
aVserve as a great example.
p354
aVUltra-endurance was once thought to be harmful
p355
aVto human health,
p356
aVbut now we realize
p357
aVthat we have all these traits
p358
aVthat are perfect for ultra-endurance:
p359
aVno body fur and a glut of sweat glands
p360
aVthat keep us cool while running;
p361
aVnarrow waists and long legs compared to our frames;
p362
aVlarge surface area of joints for shock absorption.
p363
aVWe have an arch in our foot that acts like a spring,
p364
aVshort toes that are better for pushing off
p365
aVthan for grasping tree limbs,
p366
aVand when we run,
p367
aVwe can turn our torso and our shoulders
p368
aVlike this while keeping our heads straight.
p369
aVOur primate cousins can't do that.
p370
aVThey have to run like this.
p371
aVAnd we have big old butt muscles
p372
aVthat keep us upright while running.
p373
aVHave you ever looked at an ape's butt?
p374
aVThey have no buns because they don't run upright.
p375
aVAnd as athletes have realized
p376
aVthat we're perfectly suited for ultra-endurance,
p377
aVthey've taken on feats
p378
aVthat would have been unthinkable before,
p379
aVathletes like Spanish endurance racer Kílian Jornet.
p380
aVHere's Kílian running up the Matterhorn.
p381
aV(Laughter)
p382
aVWith a sweatshirt there tied around his waist.
p383
aVIt's so steep he can't even run here.
p384
aVHe's pulling up on a rope.
p385
aVThis is a vertical ascent
p386
aVof more than 8,000 feet,
p387
aVand Kílian went up and down
p388
aVin under three hours.
p389
aVAmazing.
p390
aVAnd talented though he is,
p391
aVKílian is not a physiological freak.
p392
aVNow that he has done this,
p393
aVother athletes will follow,
p394
aVjust as other athletes followed
p395
aVafter Sir Roger Bannister
p396
aVran under four minutes in the mile.
p397
