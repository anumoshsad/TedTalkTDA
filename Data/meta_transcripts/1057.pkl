VI will start by posing a little bit of a challenge:
p4
aVthe challenge of dealing with data,
p5
aVdata that we have to deal with
p6
aVin medical situations.
p7
aVIt's really a huge challenge for us.
p8
aVAnd this is our beast of burden \u2014
p9
aVthis is a Computer Tomography machine,
p10
aVa CT machine.
p11
aVIt's a fantastic device.
p12
aVIt uses X-rays, X-ray beams,
p13
aVthat are rotating very fast around the human body.
p14
aVIt takes about 30 seconds to go through the whole machine
p15
aVand is generating enormous amounts of information
p16
aVthat comes out of the machine.
p17
aVSo this is a fantastic machine
p18
aVthat we can use
p19
aVfor improving health care,
p20
aVbut as I said, it's also a challenge for us.
p21
aVAnd the challenge is really found in this picture here.
p22
aVIt's the medical data explosion
p23
aVthat we're having right now.
p24
aVWe're facing this problem.
p25
aVAnd let me step back in time.
p26
aa(lp27
VLet's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then.
p28
aVThese machines that came out \u2014
p29
aVthey started coming in the 1970s \u2014
p30
aVthey would scan human bodies,
p31
aVand they would generate about 100 images
p32
aVof the human body.
p33
aVAnd I've taken the liberty, just for clarity,
p34
aVto translate that to data slices.
p35
aVThat would correspond to about 50 megabytes of data,
p36
aVwhich is small
p37
aVwhen you think about the data we can handle today
p38
aVjust on normal mobile devices.
p39
aVIf you translate that to phone books,
p40
aVit's about one meter of phone books in the pile.
p41
aVLooking at what we're doing today
p42
aVwith these machines that we have,
p43
aVwe can, just in a few seconds,
p44
aVget 24,000 images out of a body,
p45
aVand that would correspond to about 20 gigabytes of data,
p46
aVor 800 phone books,
p47
aVand the pile would then be 200 meters of phone books.
p48
aVWhat's about to happen \u2014
p49
aVand we're seeing this; it's beginning \u2014
p50
aVa technology trend that's happening right now
p51
aVis that we're starting to look at time-resolved situations as well.
p52
aVSo we're getting the dynamics out of the body as well.
p53
aVAnd just assume
p54
aVthat we will be collecting data during five seconds,
p55
aVand that would correspond to one terabyte of data \u2014
p56
aVthat's 800,000 books
p57
aVand 16 kilometers of phone books.
p58
aVThat's one patient, one data set.
p59
aVAnd this is what we have to deal with.
p60
aa(lp61
VSo this is really the enormous challenge that we have.
p62
aVAnd already today \u2014 this is 25,000 images.
p63
aVImagine the days
p64
aVwhen we had radiologists doing this.
p65
aVThey would put up 25,000 images,
p66
aVthey would go like this, "25,0000, okay, okay.
p67
aVThere is the problem."
p68
aVThey can't do that anymore. That's impossible.
p69
aVSo we have to do something that's a little bit more intelligent than doing this.
p70
aVSo what we do is that we put all these slices together.
p71
aVImagine that you slice your body in all these directions,
p72
aVand then you try to put the slices back together again
p73
aVinto a pile of data, into a block of data.
p74
aVSo this is really what we're doing.
p75
aVSo this gigabyte or terabyte of data, we're putting it into this block.
p76
aVBut of course, the block of data
p77
aVjust contains the amount of X-ray
p78
aVthat's been absorbed in each point in the human body.
p79
aVSo what we need to do is to figure out a way
p80
aVof looking at the things we do want to look at
p81
aVand make things transparent that we don't want to look at.
p82
aVSo transforming the data set
p83
aVinto something that looks like this.
p84
aVAnd this is a challenge.
p85
aVThis is a huge challenge for us to do that.
p86
aa(lp87
VUsing computers, even though they're getting faster and better all the time,
p88
aVit's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data,
p89
aVterabytes of data
p90
aVand extracting the relevant information.
p91
aVI want to look at the heart.
p92
aVI want to look at the blood vessels. I want to look at the liver.
p93
aVMaybe even find a tumor,
p94
aVin some cases.
p95
aVSo this is where this little dear comes into play.
p96
aVThis is my daughter.
p97
aVThis is as of 9 a.m. this morning.
p98
aVShe's playing a computer game.
p99
aVShe's only two years old,
p100
aVand she's having a blast.
p101
aVSo she's really the driving force
p102
aVbehind the development of graphics-processing units.
p103
aVAs long as kids are playing computer games,
p104
aVgraphics is getting better and better and better.
p105
aVSo please go back home, tell your kids to play more games,
p106
aVbecause that's what I need.
p107
aa(lp108
VSo what's inside of this machine
p109
aVis what enables me to do the things that I'm doing
p110
aVwith the medical data.
p111
aVSo really what I'm doing is using these fantastic little devices.
p112
aVAnd you know, going back
p113
aVmaybe 10 years in time
p114
aVwhen I got the funding
p115
aVto buy my first graphics computer \u2014
p116
aVit was a huge machine.
p117
aVIt was cabinets of processors and storage and everything.
p118
aVI paid about one million dollars for that machine.
p119
aVThat machine is, today, about as fast as my iPhone.
p120
aVSo every month there are new graphics cards coming out,
p121
aVand here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors \u2014
p122
aVNVIDIA, ATI, Intel is out there as well.
p123
aVAnd you know, for a few hundred bucks
p124
aVyou can get these things and put them into your computer,
p125
aVand you can do fantastic things with these graphics cards.
p126
aVSo this is really what's enabling us
p127
aVto deal with the explosion of data in medicine,
p128
aVtogether with some really nifty work
p129
aVin terms of algorithms \u2014
p130
aVcompressing data,
p131
aVextracting the relevant information that people are doing research on.
p132
aa(lp133
VSo I'm going to show you a few examples of what we can do.
p134
aVThis is a data set that was captured using a CT scanner.
p135
aVYou can see that this is a full data [set].
p136
aVIt's a woman. You can see the hair.
p137
aVYou can see the individual structures of the woman.
p138
aVYou can see that there is [a] scattering of X-rays
p139
aVon the teeth, the metal in the teeth.
p140
aVThat's where those artifacts are coming from.
p141
aVBut fully interactively
p142
aVon standard graphics cards on a normal computer,
p143
aVI can just put in a clip plane.
p144
aVAnd of course all the data is inside,
p145
aVso I can start rotating, I can look at it from different angles,
p146
aVand I can see that this woman had a problem.
p147
aVShe had a bleeding up in the brain,
p148
aVand that's been fixed with a little stent,
p149
aVa metal clamp that's tightening up the vessel.
p150
aVAnd just by changing the functions,
p151
aVthen I can decide what's going to be transparent
p152
aVand what's going to be visible.
p153
aVI can look at the skull structure,
p154
aVand I can see that, okay, this is where they opened up the skull on this woman,
p155
aVand that's where they went in.
p156
aVSo these are fantastic images.
p157
aVThey're really high resolution,
p158
aVand they're really showing us what we can do
p159
aVwith standard graphics cards today.
p160
aa(lp161
VNow we have really made use of this,
p162
aVand we have tried to squeeze a lot of data
p163
aVinto the system.
p164
aVAnd one of the applications that we've been working on \u2014
p165
aVand this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide \u2014
p166
aVis the application of virtual autopsies.
p167
aVSo again, looking at very, very large data sets,
p168
aVand you saw those full-body scans that we can do.
p169
aVWe're just pushing the body through the whole CT scanner,
p170
aVand just in a few seconds we can get a full-body data set.
p171
aVSo this is from a virtual autopsy.
p172
aVAnd you can see how I'm gradually peeling off.
p173
aVFirst you saw the body bag that the body came in,
p174
aVthen I'm peeling off the skin \u2014 you can see the muscles \u2014
p175
aVand eventually you can see the bone structure of this woman.
p176
aa(lp177
VNow at this point, I would also like to emphasize
p178
aVthat, with the greatest respect
p179
aVfor the people that I'm now going to show \u2014
p180
aVI'm going to show you a few cases of virtual autopsies \u2014
p181
aVso it's with great respect for the people
p182
aVthat have died under violent circumstances
p183
aVthat I'm showing these pictures to you.
p184
aVIn the forensic case \u2014
p185
aVand this is something
p186
aVthat ... there's been approximately 400 cases so far
p187
aVjust in the part of Sweden that I come from
p188
aVthat has been undergoing virtual autopsies
p189
aVin the past four years.
p190
aVSo this will be the typical workflow situation.
p191
aVThe police will decide \u2014
p192
aVin the evening, when there's a case coming in \u2014
p193
aVthey will decide, okay, is this a case where we need to do an autopsy?
p194
aVSo in the morning, in between six and seven in the morning,
p195
aVthe body is then transported inside of the body bag
p196
aVto our center
p197
aVand is being scanned through one of the CT scanners.
p198
aVAnd then the radiologist, together with the pathologist
p199
aVand sometimes the forensic scientist,
p200
aVlooks at the data that's coming out,
p201
aVand they have a joint session.
p202
aVAnd then they decide what to do in the real physical autopsy after that.
p203
aa(lp204
VNow looking at a few cases,
p205
aVhere's one of the first cases that we had.
p206
aVYou can really see the details of the data set.
p207
aVIt's very high-resolution,
p208
aVand it's our algorithms that allow us
p209
aVto zoom in on all the details.
p210
aVAnd again, it's fully interactive,
p211
aVso you can rotate and you can look at things in real time
p212
aVon these systems here.
p213
aVWithout saying too much about this case,
p214
aVthis is a traffic accident,
p215
aVa drunk driver hit a woman.
p216
aVAnd it's very, very easy to see the damages on the bone structure.
p217
aVAnd the cause of death is the broken neck.
p218
aVAnd this women also ended up under the car,
p219
aVso she's quite badly beaten up
p220
aVby this injury.
p221
aa(lp222
VHere's another case, a knifing.
p223
aVAnd this is also again showing us what we can do.
p224
aVIt's very easy to look at metal artifacts
p225
aVthat we can show inside of the body.
p226
aVYou can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth \u2014
p227
aVthat's actually the filling of the teeth \u2014
p228
aVbut because I've set the functions to show me metal
p229
aVand make everything else transparent.
p230
aVHere's another violent case. This really didn't kill the person.
p231
aVThe person was killed by stabs in the heart,
p232
aVbut they just deposited the knife
p233
aVby putting it through one of the eyeballs.
p234
aVHere's another case.
p235
aVIt's very interesting for us
p236
aVto be able to look at things like knife stabbings.
p237
aVHere you can see that knife went through the heart.
p238
aVIt's very easy to see how air has been leaking
p239
aVfrom one part to another part,
p240
aVwhich is difficult to do in a normal, standard, physical autopsy.
p241
aVSo it really, really helps
p242
aVthe criminal investigation
p243
aVto establish the cause of death,
p244
aVand in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction
p245
aVto find out who the killer really was.
p246
aa(lp247
VHere's another case that I think is interesting.
p248
aVHere you can see a bullet
p249
aVthat has lodged just next to the spine on this person.
p250
aVAnd what we've done is that we've turned the bullet into a light source,
p251
aVso that bullet is actually shining,
p252
aVand it makes it really easy to find these fragments.
p253
aVDuring a physical autopsy,
p254
aVif you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments,
p255
aVthat's actually quite hard to do.
p256
aa(lp257
VOne of the things that I'm really, really happy
p258
aVto be able to show you here today
p259
aVis our virtual autopsy table.
p260
aVIt's a touch device that we have developed
p261
aVbased on these algorithms, using standard graphics GPUs.
p262
aVIt actually looks like this,
p263
aVjust to give you a feeling for what it looks like.
p264
aVIt really just works like a huge iPhone.
p265
aVSo we've implemented
p266
aVall the gestures you can do on the table,
p267
aVand you can think of it as an enormous touch interface.
p268
aVSo if you were thinking of buying an iPad,
p269
aVforget about it. This is what you want instead.
p270
aVSteve, I hope you're listening to this, all right.
p271
aVSo it's a very nice little device.
p272
aVSo if you have the opportunity, please try it out.
p273
aVIt's really a hands-on experience.
p274
aVSo it gained some traction, and we're trying to roll this out
p275
aVand trying to use it for educational purposes,
p276
aVbut also, perhaps in the future,
p277
aVin a more clinical situation.
p278
aVThere's a YouTube video that you can download and look at this,
p279
aVif you want to convey the information to other people
p280
aVabout virtual autopsies.
p281
aa(lp282
VOkay, now that we're talking about touch,
p283
aVlet me move on to really "touching" data.
p284
aVAnd this is a bit of science fiction now,
p285
aVso we're moving into really the future.
p286
aVThis is not really what the medical doctors are using right now,
p287
aVbut I hope they will in the future.
p288
aVSo what you're seeing on the left is a touch device.
p289
aVIt's a little mechanical pen
p290
aVthat has very, very fast step motors inside of the pen.
p291
aVAnd so I can generate a force feedback.
p292
aVSo when I virtually touch data,
p293
aVit will generate forces in the pen, so I get a feedback.
p294
aVSo in this particular situation,
p295
aVit's a scan of a living person.
p296
aVI have this pen, and I look at the data,
p297
aVand I move the pen towards the head,
p298
aVand all of a sudden I feel resistance.
p299
aVSo I can feel the skin.
p300
aVIf I push a little bit harder, I'll go through the skin,
p301
aVand I can feel the bone structure inside.
p302
aVIf I push even harder, I'll go through the bone structure,
p303
aVespecially close to the ear where the bone is very soft.
p304
aVAnd then I can feel the brain inside, and this will be the slushy like this.
p305
aa(lp306
VSo this is really nice.
p307
aVAnd to take that even further, this is a heart.
p308
aVAnd this is also due to these fantastic new scanners,
p309
aVthat just in 0.3 seconds,
p310
aVI can scan the whole heart,
p311
aVand I can do that with time resolution.
p312
aVSo just looking at this heart,
p313
aVI can play back a video here.
p314
aVAnd this is Karljohan, one of my graduate students
p315
aVwho's been working on this project.
p316
aVAnd he's sitting there in front of the Haptic device, the force feedback system,
p317
aVand he's moving his pen towards the heart,
p318
aVand the heart is now beating in front of him,
p319
aVso he can see how the heart is beating.
p320
aVHe's taken the pen, and he's moving it towards the heart,
p321
aVand he's putting it on the heart,
p322
aVand then he feels the heartbeats from the real living patient.
p323
aVThen he can examine how the heart is moving.
p324
aVHe can go inside, push inside of the heart,
p325
aVand really feel how the valves are moving.
p326
aVAnd this, I think, is really the future for heart surgeons.
p327
aVI mean it's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon
p328
aVto be able to go inside of the patient's heart
p329
aVbefore you actually do surgery,
p330
aVand do that with high-quality resolution data.
p331
aVSo this is really neat.
p332
aa(lp333
VNow we're going even further into science fiction.
p334
aVAnd we heard a little bit about functional MRI.
p335
aVNow this is really an interesting project.
p336
aVMRI is using magnetic fields
p337
aVand radio frequencies
p338
aVto scan the brain, or any part of the body.
p339
aVSo what we're really getting out of this
p340
aVis information of the structure of the brain,
p341
aVbut we can also measure the difference
p342
aVin magnetic properties of blood that's oxygenated
p343
aVand blood that's depleted of oxygen.
p344
aVThat means that it's possible
p345
aVto map out the activity of the brain.
p346
aVSo this is something that we've been working on.
p347
aVAnd you just saw Motts the research engineer, there,
p348
aVgoing into the MRI system,
p349
aVand he was wearing goggles.
p350
aVSo he could actually see things in the goggles.
p351
aVSo I could present things to him while he's in the scanner.
p352
aVAnd this is a little bit freaky,
p353
aVbecause what Motts is seeing is actually this.
p354
aVHe's seeing his own brain.
p355
aVSo Motts is doing something here,
p356
aVand probably he is going like this with his right hand,
p357
aVbecause the left side is activated
p358
aVon the motor cortex.
p359
aVAnd then he can see that at the same time.
p360
aVThese visualizations are brand new.
p361
aVAnd this is something that we've been researching for a little while.
p362
aa(lp363
VThis is another sequence of Motts' brain.
p364
aVAnd here we asked Motts to calculate backwards from 100.
p365
aVSo he's going "100, 97, 94."
p366
aVAnd then he's going backwards.
p367
aVAnd you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain
p368
aVand is lighting up the whole brain.
p369
aVWell this is fantastic. We can do this in real time.
p370
aVWe can investigate things. We can tell him to do things.
p371
aVYou can also see that his visual cortex
p372
aVis activated in the back of the head,
p373
aVbecause that's where he's seeing, he's seeing his own brain.
p374
aVAnd he's also hearing our instructions
p375
aVwhen we tell him to do things.
p376
aVThe signal is really deep inside of the brain as well,
p377
aVand it's shining through,
p378
aVbecause all of the data is inside this volume.
p379
aVAnd in just a second here you will see \u2014
p380
aVokay, here. Motts, now move your left foot.
p381
aVSo he's going like this.
p382
aVFor 20 seconds he's going like that,
p383
aVand all of a sudden it lights up up here.
p384
aVSo we've got motor cortex activation up there.
p385
aVSo this is really, really nice,
p386
aVand I think this is a great tool.
p387
aVAnd connecting also with the previous talk here,
p388
aVthis is something that we could use as a tool
p389
aVto really understand
p390
aVhow the neurons are working, how the brain is working,
p391
aVand we can do this with very, very high visual quality
p392
aVand very fast resolution.
p393
aa(lp394
VNow we're also having a bit of fun at the center.
p395
aVSo this is a CAT scan \u2014 Computer Aided Tomography.
p396
aVSo this is a lion from the local zoo
p397
aVoutside of Norrkoping in Kolmarden, Elsa.
p398
aVSo she came to the center,
p399
aVand they sedated her
p400
aVand then put her straight into the scanner.
p401
aVAnd then, of course, I get the whole data set from the lion.
p402
aVAnd I can do very nice images like this.
p403
aVI can peel off the layer of the lion.
p404
aVI can look inside of it.
p405
aVAnd we've been experimenting with this.
p406
aVAnd I think this is a great application
p407
aVfor the future of this technology,
p408
aVbecause there's very little known about the animal anatomy.
p409
aVWhat's known out there for veterinarians is kind of basic information.
p410
aVWe can scan all sorts of things,
p411
aVall sorts of animals.
p412
aVThe only problem is to fit it into the machine.
p413
aVSo here's a bear.
p414
aVIt was kind of hard to get it in.
p415
aVAnd the bear is a cuddly, friendly animal.
p416
aVAnd here it is. Here is the nose of the bear.
p417
aVAnd you might want to cuddle this one,
p418
aVuntil you change the functions and look at this.
p419
aVSo be aware of the bear.
p420
aa(lp421
VSo with that,
p422
aVI'd like to thank all the people
p423
aVwho have helped me to generate these images.
p424
aVIt's a huge effort that goes into doing this,
p425
aVgathering the data and developing the algorithms,
p426
aVwriting all the software.
p427
aVSo, some very talented people.
p428
aVMy motto is always, I only hire people that are smarter than I am
p429
aVand most of these are smarter than I am.
