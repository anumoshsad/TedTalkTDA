VI am a chef
p4
aVand a food policy guy,
p5
aVbut I come from a whole family of teachers.
p6
aVMy sister is a special ed teacher in Chicago.
p7
aVMy father just retired after 25 years teaching fifth grade.
p8
aVMy aunt and uncle were professors.
p9
aVMy cousins all teach.
p10
aVEverybody in my family, basically, teaches except for me.
p11
aVThey taught me that the only way to get the right answers
p12
aVis to ask the right questions.
p13
aVSo what are the right questions
p14
aVwhen it comes to improving the educational outcomes for our children?
p15
aVThere's obviously many important questions,
p16
aVbut I think the following is a good place to start:
p17
aVWhat do we think the connection is
p18
aVbetween a child's growing mind
p19
aVand their growing body?
p20
aVWhat can we expect our kids to learn
p21
aVif their diets are full of sugar and empty of nutrients?
p22
aVWhat can they possibly learn
p23
aVif their bodies are literally going hungry?
p24
aVAnd with all the resources that we are pouring into schools,
p25
aVwe should stop and ask ourselves:
p26
aVAre we really setting our kids up for success?
p27
aa(lp28
VNow, a few years ago,
p29
aVI was a judge on a cooking competition called "Chopped."
p30
aVFour chefs compete with mystery ingredients
p31
aVto see who can cook the best dishes.
p32
aVExcept for this episode \u2014 it was a very special one.
p33
aVInstead of four overzealous chefs trying to break into the limelight \u2014
p34
aVsomething that I would know nothing about \u2014
p35
aV(Laughter)
p36
aVthese chefs were school chefs;
p37
aVyou know, the women that you used to call "lunch ladies,"
p38
aVbut the ones I insist we call "school chefs."
p39
aVNow, these women \u2014 God bless these women \u2014
p40
aVspend their day cooking for thousands of kids,
p41
aVbreakfast and lunch, with only $2.68 per lunch,
p42
aVwith only about a dollar of that actually going to the food.
p43
aVIn this episode,
p44
aVthe main-course mystery ingredient was quinoa.
p45
aVNow, I know it's been a long time
p46
aVsince most of you have had a school lunch,
p47
aVand we've made a lot of progress on nutrition,
p48
aVbut quinoa still is not a staple in most school cafeterias.
p49
aa(lp50
V(Laughter)
p51
aa(lp52
VSo this was a challenge.
p53
aVBut the dish that I will never forget was cooked by a woman
p54
aVnamed Cheryl Barbara.
p55
aVCheryl was the nutrition director
p56
aVat High School in the Community in Connecticut.
p57
aVShe cooked this delicious pasta.
p58
aVIt was amazing.
p59
aVIt was a pappardelle with Italian sausage,
p60
aVkale, Parmesan cheese.
p61
aVIt was delicious, like, restaurant-quality good, except \u2014
p62
aVshe basically just threw the quinoa, pretty much uncooked,
p63
aVinto the dish.
p64
aVIt was a strange choice,
p65
aVand it was super crunchy.
p66
aV(Laughter)
p67
aVSo I took on the TV accusatory judge thing that you're supposed to do,
p68
aVand I asked her why she did that.
p69
aa(lp70
VCheryl responded, "Well, first, I don't know what quinoa is."
p71
aV(Laughter)
p72
aV"But I do know that it's a Monday,
p73
aVand that in my school, at High School in the Community,
p74
aVI always cook pasta."
p75
aa(lp76
VSee, Cheryl explained that for many of her kids,
p77
aVthere were no meals on the weekends.
p78
aVNo meals on Saturday.
p79
aVNo meals on Sunday, either.
p80
aVSo she cooked pasta because she wanted to make sure
p81
aVshe cooked something she knew her children would eat.
p82
aVSomething that would stick to their ribs, she said.
p83
aVSomething that would fill them up.
p84
aVCheryl talked about how, by the time Monday came,
p85
aVher kids' hunger pangs were so intense
p86
aVthat they couldn't even begin to think about learning.
p87
aVFood was the only thing on their mind.
p88
aVThe only thing.
p89
aVAnd unfortunately, the stats \u2014 they tell the same story.
p90
aa(lp91
VSo, let's put this into the context of a child.
p92
aa(lp93
VAnd we're going to focus on
p94
aVthe most important meal of the day, breakfast.
p95
aVMeet Allison.
p96
aVShe's 12 years old,
p97
aVshe's smart as a whip
p98
aVand she wants to be a physicist when she grows up.
p99
aVIf Allison goes to a school that serves a nutritious breakfast
p100
aVto all of their kids,
p101
aVhere's what's going to follow.
p102
aVHer chances of getting a nutritious meal,
p103
aVone with fruit and milk, one lower in sugar and salt,
p104
aVdramatically increase.
p105
aVAllison will have a lower rate of obesity than the average kid.
p106
aVShe'll have to visit the nurse less.
p107
aVShe'll have lower levels of anxiety and depression.
p108
aVShe'll have better behavior.
p109
aVShe'll have better attendance, and she'll show up on time more often.
p110
aVWhy?
p111
aVWell, because there's a good meal waiting for her at school.
p112
aVOverall, Allison is in much better health
p113
aVthan the average school kid.
p114
aa(lp115
VSo what about that kid
p116
aVwho doesn't have a nutritious breakfast waiting for him?
p117
aVWell, meet Tommy.
p118
aVHe's also 12. He's a wonderful kid.
p119
aVHe wants to be a doctor.
p120
aVBy the time Tommy is in kindergarten,
p121
aVhe's already underperforming in math.
p122
aVBy the time he's in third grade,
p123
aVhe's got lower math and reading scores.
p124
aVBy the time he's 11,
p125
aVit's more likely that Tommy will have to have repeated a grade.
p126
aVResearch shows that kids who do not have consistent nourishment,
p127
aVparticularly at breakfast,
p128
aVhave poor cognitive function overall.
p129
aa(lp130
VSo how widespread is this problem?
p131
aVWell, unfortunately, it's pervasive.
p132
aVLet me give you two stats
p133
aVthat seem like they're on opposite ends of the issue,
p134
aVbut are actually two sides of the same coin.
p135
aVOn the one hand,
p136
aVone in six Americans are food insecure,
p137
aVincluding 16 million children \u2014 almost 20 percent \u2014
p138
aVare food insecure.
p139
aVIn this city alone, in New York City,
p140
aV474,000 kids under the age of 18 face hunger every year.
p141
aVIt's crazy.
p142
aVOn the other hand,
p143
aVdiet and nutrition is the number one cause of preventable death and disease
p144
aVin this country, by far.
p145
aVAnd fully a third of the kids that we've been talking about tonight
p146
aVare on track to have diabetes in their lifetime.
p147
aVNow, what's hard to put together but is true
p148
aVis that, many times, these are the same children.
p149
aVSo they fill up on the unhealthy and cheap calories
p150
aVthat surround them in their communities and that their families can afford.
p151
aVBut then by the end of the month,
p152
aVfood stamps run out or hours get cut at work,
p153
aVand they don't have the money to cover the basic cost of food.
p154
aa(lp155
VBut we should be able to solve this problem, right?
p156
aVWe know what the answers are.
p157
aVAs part of my work at the White House, we instituted a program
p158
aVthat for all schools that had 40 percent more low-income kids,
p159
aVwe could serve breakfast and lunch to every kid in that school.
p160
aVFor free.
p161
aa(lp162
VThis program has been incredibly successful,
p163
aVbecause it helped us overcome a very difficult barrier
p164
aVwhen it came to getting kids a nutritious breakfast.
p165
aVAnd that was the barrier of stigma.
p166
aVSee, schools serve breakfast before school,
p167
aVand it was only available for the poor kids.
p168
aVSo everybody knew who was poor and who needed government help.
p169
aVNow, all kids, no matter how much or how little their parents make,
p170
aVhave a lot of pride.
p171
aVSo what happened?
p172
aVWell, the schools that have implemented this program
p173
aVsaw an increase in math and reading scores by 17.5 percent.
p174
aV17.5 percent.
p175
aVAnd research shows that when kids have a consistent, nutritious breakfast,
p176
aVtheir chances of graduating increase by 20 percent.
p177
aV20 percent.
p178
aVWhen we give our kids the nourishment they need,
p179
aVwe give them the chance to thrive,
p180
aVboth in the classroom and beyond.
p181
aa(lp182
VNow, you don't have to trust me on this,
p183
aVbut you should talk to Donna Martin.
p184
aVI love Donna Martin.
p185
aVDonna Martin is the school nutrition director at Burke County
p186
aVin Waynesboro, Georgia.
p187
aVBurke County is one of the poorest districts
p188
aVin the fifth-poorest state in the country,
p189
aVand about 100 percent of Donna's students live at or below the poverty line.
p190
aVA few years ago,
p191
aVDonna decided to get out ahead of the new standards that were coming,
p192
aVand overhaul her nutrition standards.
p193
aVShe improved and added fruit and vegetables and whole grains.
p194
aVShe served breakfast in the classroom to all of her kids.
p195
aVAnd she implemented a dinner program.
p196
aVWhy?
p197
aVWell, many of her kids didn't have dinner when they went home.
p198
aa(lp199
VSo how did they respond?
p200
aVWell, the kids loved the food.
p201
aVThey loved the better nutrition,
p202
aVand they loved not being hungry.
p203
aVBut Donna's biggest supporter came from an unexpected place.
p204
aVHis name from Eric Parker,
p205
aVand he was the head football coach for the Burke County Bears.
p206
aVNow, Coach Parker had coached mediocre teams for years.
p207
aVThe Bears often ended in the middle of the pack \u2014
p208
aVa big disappointment in one of the most passionate football states
p209
aVin the Union.
p210
aVBut the year Donna changed the menus,
p211
aVthe Bears not only won their division,
p212
aVthey went on to win the state championship,
p213
aVbeating the Peach County Trojans
p214
aV28-14.
p215
aa(lp216
V(Laughter)
p217
aa(lp218
VAnd Coach Parker,
p219
aVhe credited that championship to Donna Martin.
p220
aa(lp221
VWhen we give our kids the basic nourishment,
p222
aVthey're going to thrive.
p223
aVAnd it's not just up to the Cheryl Barbaras
p224
aVand the Donna Martins of the world.
p225
aVIt's on all of us.
p226
aVAnd feeding our kids the basic nutrition is just the starting point.
p227
aVWhat I've laid out is really a model
p228
aVfor so many of the most pressing issues that we face.
p229
aVIf we focus on the simple goal of properly nourishing ourselves,
p230
aVwe could see a world that is more stable and secure;
p231
aVwe could dramatically improve our economic productivity;
p232
aVwe could transform our health care
p233
aVand we could go a long way
p234
aVin ensuring that the Earth can provide for generations to come.
p235
aVFood is that place where our collective efforts
p236
aVcan have the greatest impact.
p237
aa(lp238
VSo we have to ask ourselves: What is the right question?
p239
aVWhat would happen
p240
aVif we fed ourselves more nutritious, more sustainably grown food?
p241
aVWhat would be the impact?
p242
aVCheryl Barbara,
p243
aVDonna Martin,
p244
aVCoach Parker and the Burke County Bears \u2014
p245
aVI think they know the answer.
p246
aa(lp247
VThank you guys so very much.
