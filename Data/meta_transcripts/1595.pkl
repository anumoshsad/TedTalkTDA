VSo little Billy goes to school,
p4
aVand he sits down and the teacher says,
p5
aV"What does your father do?"
p6
aVAnd little Billy says, "My father plays the piano
p7
aVin an opium den."
p8
aVSo the teacher rings up the parents, and says,
p9
aV"Very shocking story from little Billy today.
p10
aVJust heard that he claimed that you play the piano
p11
aVin an opium den."
p12
aVAnd the father says, "I'm very sorry. Yes, it's true, I lied.
p13
aVBut how can I tell an eight-year-old boy
p14
aVthat his father is a politician?" (Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VNow, as a politician myself, standing in front of you,
p17
aVor indeed, meeting any stranger anywhere in the world,
p18
aVwhen I eventually reveal the nature of my profession,
p19
aVthey look at me as though I'm somewhere between
p20
aVa snake, a monkey and an iguana,
p21
aVand through all of this, I feel, strongly,
p22
aVthat something is going wrong.
p23
aVFour hundred years of maturing democracy,
p24
aVcolleagues in Parliament who seem to me, as individuals,
p25
aVreasonably impressive, an increasingly educated,
p26
aVenergetic, informed population, and yet
p27
aVa deep, deep sense of disappointment.
p28
aVMy colleagues in Parliament include, in my new intake,
p29
aVfamily doctors, businesspeople, professors,
p30
aVdistinguished economists, historians, writers,
p31
aVarmy officers ranging from colonels down to regimental sergeant majors.
p32
aVAll of them, however, including myself, as we walk underneath
p33
aVthose strange stone gargoyles just down the road,
p34
aVfeel that we've become less than the sum of our parts,
p35
aVfeel as though we have become profoundly diminished.
p36
aa(lp37
VAnd this isn't just a problem in Britain.
p38
aVIt's a problem across the developing world,
p39
aVand in middle income countries too. In Jamaica,
p40
aVfor example \u2014 look at Jamaican members of Parliament,
p41
aVyou meet them, and they're often people who are
p42
aVRhodes Scholars, who've studied at Harvard or at Princeton,
p43
aVand yet, you go down to downtown Kingston,
p44
aVand you are looking at one of the most depressing sites
p45
aVthat you can see in any middle-income country in the world:
p46
aVa dismal, depressing landscape
p47
aVof burnt and half-abandoned buildings.
p48
aVAnd this has been true for 30 years, and the handover
p49
aVin 1979, 1980, between one Jamaican leader who was
p50
aVthe son of a Rhodes Scholar and a Q.C. to another
p51
aVwho'd done an economics doctorate at Harvard,
p52
aVover 800 people were killed in the streets
p53
aVin drug-related violence.
p54
aa(lp55
VTen years ago, however, the promise of democracy
p56
aVseemed to be extraordinary. George W. Bush stood up
p57
aVin his State of the Union address in 2003
p58
aVand said that democracy was the force that would beat
p59
aVmost of the ills of the world. He said,
p60
aVbecause democratic governments respect their own people
p61
aVand respect their neighbors, freedom will bring peace.
p62
aVDistinguished academics at the same time argued that
p63
aVdemocracies had this incredible range of side benefits.
p64
aVThey would bring prosperity, security,
p65
aVovercome sectarian violence,
p66
aVensure that states would never again harbor terrorists.
p67
aa(lp68
VSince then, what's happened?
p69
aVWell, what we've seen is the creation, in places like Iraq
p70
aVand Afghanistan, of democratic systems of government
p71
aVwhich haven't had any of those side benefits.
p72
aVIn Afghanistan, for example, we haven't just had one election
p73
aVor two elections. We've gone through three elections,
p74
aVpresidential and parliamentary. And what do we find?
p75
aVDo we find a flourishing civil society, a vigorous rule of law
p76
aVand good security? No. What we find in Afghanistan
p77
aVis a judiciary that is weak and corrupt,
p78
aVa very limited civil society which is largely ineffective,
p79
aVa media which is beginning to get onto its feet
p80
aVbut a government that's deeply unpopular,
p81
aVperceived as being deeply corrupt, and security
p82
aVthat is shocking, security that's terrible.
p83
aVIn Pakistan, in lots of sub-Saharan Africa,
p84
aVagain you can see democracy and elections are compatible
p85
aVwith corrupt governments, with states that are unstable
p86
aVand dangerous.
p87
aVAnd when I have conversations with people, I remember
p88
aVhaving a conversation, for example, in Iraq,
p89
aVwith a community that asked me
p90
aVwhether the riot we were seeing in front of us,
p91
aVthis was a huge mob ransacking a provincial council building,
p92
aVwas a sign of the new democracy.
p93
aVThe same, I felt, was true in almost every single one
p94
aVof the middle and developing countries that I went to,
p95
aVand to some extent the same is true of us.
p96
aa(lp97
VWell, what is the answer to this? Is the answer to just
p98
aVgive up on the idea of democracy?
p99
aVWell, obviously not. It would be absurd
p100
aVif we were to engage again in the kind of operations
p101
aVwe were engaged in, in Iraq and Afghanistan
p102
aVif we were to suddenly find ourselves in a situation
p103
aVin which we were imposing
p104
aVanything other than a democratic system.
p105
aVAnything else would run contrary to our values,
p106
aVit would run contrary to the wishes of the people
p107
aVon the ground, it would run contrary to our interests.
p108
aVI remember in Iraq, for example, that we went through
p109
aVa period of feeling that we should delay democracy.
p110
aVWe went through a period of feeling that the lesson learned
p111
aVfrom Bosnia was that elections held too early
p112
aVenshrined sectarian violence, enshrined extremist parties,
p113
aVso in Iraq in 2003 the decision was made,
p114
aVlet's not have elections for two years. Let's invest in
p115
aVvoter education. Let's invest in democratization.
p116
aVThe result was that I found stuck outside my office
p117
aVa huge crowd of people, this is actually a photograph
p118
aVtaken in Libya but I saw the same scene in Iraq
p119
aVof people standing outside screaming for the elections,
p120
aVand when I went out and said, "What is wrong
p121
aVwith the interim provincial council?
p122
aVWhat is wrong with the people that we have chosen?
p123
aVThere is a Sunni sheikh, there's a Shiite sheikh,
p124
aVthere's the seven \u2014 leaders of the seven major tribes,
p125
aVthere's a Christian, there's a Sabian,
p126
aVthere are female representatives, there's every political party in this council,
p127
aVwhat's wrong with the people that we chose?"
p128
aVThe answer came, "The problem isn't the people
p129
aVthat you chose. The problem is that you chose them."
p130
aVI have not met, in Afghanistan, in even the most
p131
aVremote community, anybody who does not want
p132
aVa say in who governs them.
p133
aVMost remote community, I have never met a villager
p134
aVwho does not want a vote.
p135
aa(lp136
VSo we need to acknowledge
p137
aVthat despite the dubious statistics, despite the fact that
p138
aV84 percent of people in Britain feel politics is broken,
p139
aVdespite the fact that when I was in Iraq, we did an opinion poll
p140
aVin 2003 and asked people what political systems they preferred,
p141
aVand the answer came back that
p142
aVseven percent wanted the United States,
p143
aVfive percent wanted France,
p144
aVthree percent wanted Britain,
p145
aVand nearly 40 percent wanted Dubai, which is, after all,
p146
aVnot a democratic state at all but a relatively prosperous
p147
aVminor monarchy, democracy is a thing of value
p148
aVfor which we should be fighting. But in order to do so
p149
aVwe need to get away from instrumental arguments.
p150
aVWe need to get away from saying democracy matters
p151
aVbecause of the other things it brings.
p152
aVWe need to get away from feeling, in the same way,
p153
aVhuman rights matters because of the other things it brings,
p154
aVor women's rights matters for the other things it brings.
p155
aVWhy should we get away from those arguments?
p156
aVBecause they're very dangerous. If we set about saying,
p157
aVfor example, torture is wrong because it doesn't extract
p158
aVgood information, or we say, you need women's rights
p159
aVbecause it stimulates economic growth by doubling the size of the work force,
p160
aVyou leave yourself open to the position where
p161
aVthe government of North Korea can turn around and say,
p162
aV"Well actually, we're having a lot of success extracting
p163
aVgood information with our torture at the moment,"
p164
aVor the government of Saudi Arabia to say, "Well,
p165
aVour economic growth's okay, thank you very much,
p166
aVconsiderably better than yours,
p167
aVso maybe we don't need to go ahead with this program on women's rights."
p168
aa(lp169
VThe point about democracy is not instrumental.
p170
aVIt's not about the things that it brings.
p171
aVThe point about democracy is not that it delivers
p172
aVlegitimate, effective, prosperous rule of law.
p173
aVIt's not that it guarantees peace with itself or with its neighbors.
p174
aVThe point about democracy is intrinsic.
p175
aVDemocracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality
p176
aVand an idea of liberty. It reflects an idea of dignity,
p177
aVthe dignity of the individual, the idea that each individual
p178
aVshould have an equal vote, an equal say,
p179
aVin the formation of their government.
p180
aa(lp181
VBut if we're really to make democracy vigorous again,
p182
aVif we're ready to revivify it, we need to get involved
p183
aVin a new project of the citizens and the politicians.
p184
aVDemocracy is not simply a question of structures.
p185
aVIt is a state of mind. It is an activity.
p186
aVAnd part of that activity is honesty.
p187
aVAfter I speak to you today, I'm going on a radio program
p188
aVcalled "Any Questions," and the thing you will have noticed
p189
aVabout politicians on these kinds of radio programs
p190
aVis that they never, ever say that they don't know the answer
p191
aVto a question. It doesn't matter what it is.
p192
aVIf you ask about child tax credits, the future of the penguins
p193
aVin the south Antarctic, asked to hold forth on whether or not
p194
aVthe developments in Chongqing contribute
p195
aVto sustainable development in carbon capture,
p196
aVand we will have an answer for you.
p197
aVWe need to stop that, to stop pretending to be
p198
aVomniscient beings.
p199
aVPoliticians also need to learn, occasionally, to say that
p200
aVcertain things that voters want, certain things that voters
p201
aVhave been promised, may be things
p202
aVthat we cannot deliver
p203
aVor perhaps that we feel we should not deliver.
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd the second thing we should do is understand
p206
aVthe genius of our societies.
p207
aVOur societies have never been so educated, have never
p208
aVbeen so energized, have never been so healthy,
p209
aVhave never known so much, cared so much,
p210
aVor wanted to do so much, and it is a genius of the local.
p211
aVOne of the reasons why we're moving away
p212
aVfrom banqueting halls such as the one in which we stand,
p213
aVbanqueting halls with extraordinary images on the ceiling
p214
aVof kings enthroned,
p215
aVthe entire drama played out here on this space,
p216
aVwhere the King of England had his head lopped off,
p217
aVwhy we've moved from spaces like this, thrones like that,
p218
aVtowards the town hall, is we're moving more and more
p219
aVtowards the energies of our people, and we need to tap that.
p220
aa(lp221
VThat can mean different things in different countries.
p222
aVIn Britain, it could mean looking to the French,
p223
aVlearning from the French,
p224
aVgetting directly elected mayors in place
p225
aVin a French commune system.
p226
aVIn Afghanistan, it could have meant instead of concentrating
p227
aVon the big presidential and parliamentary elections,
p228
aVwe should have done what was in the Afghan constitution
p229
aVfrom the very beginning, which is to get direct local elections going
p230
aVat a district level and elect people's provincial governors.
p231
aa(lp232
VBut for any of these things to work,
p233
aVthe honesty in language, the local democracy,
p234
aVit's not just a question of what politicians do.
p235
aVIt's a question of what the citizens do.
p236
aVFor politicians to be honest, the public needs to allow them to be honest,
p237
aVand the media, which mediates between the politicians
p238
aVand the public, needs to allow those politicians to be honest.
p239
aVIf local democracy is to flourish, it is about the active
p240
aVand informed engagement of every citizen.
p241
aa(lp242
VIn other words, if democracy is to be rebuilt,
p243
aVis to become again vigorous and vibrant,
p244
aVit is necessary not just for the public
p245
aVto learn to trust their politicians,
p246
aVbut for the politicians to learn to trust the public.
p247
aVThank you very much indeed. (Applause)
