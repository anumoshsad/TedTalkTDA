VWow, this is bright.
p4
aVIt must use a lot of power.
p5
aVWell, flying you all in here
p6
aVmust have cost a bit of energy too.
p7
aVSo the whole planet needs a lot of energy,
p8
aVand so far we've been running mostly on fossil fuel.
p9
aVWe've been burning gas.
p10
aVIt's been a good run.
p11
aVIt got us to where we are, but we have to stop.
p12
aVWe can't do that anymore.
p13
aa(lp14
VSo we are trying different types of energy now,
p15
aValternative energy,
p16
aVbut it proved quite difficult to find something
p17
aVthat's as convenient and as cost-effective
p18
aVas oil, gas and coal.
p19
aVMy personal favorite is nuclear energy.
p20
aVNow, it's very energy-dense,
p21
aVit produces solid, reliable power,
p22
aVand it doesn't make any CO2.
p23
aa(lp24
VNow we know of two ways
p25
aVof making nuclear energy: fission and fusion.
p26
aVNow in fission, you take a big nucleus,
p27
aVyou break it in part, in two,
p28
aVand it makes lots of energy,
p29
aVand this is how the nuclear reactor today works.
p30
aVIt works pretty good.
p31
aVAnd then there's fusion.
p32
aVNow, I like fusion. Fusion's much better.
p33
aVSo you take two small nuclei,
p34
aVyou put it together, and you make helium,
p35
aVand that's very nice.
p36
aVIt makes lots of energy.
p37
aVThis is nature's way of producing energy.
p38
aVThe sun and all the stars in the universe
p39
aVrun on fusion.
p40
aVNow, a fusion plant
p41
aVwould actually be quite cost-effective
p42
aVand it also would be quite safe.
p43
aVIt only produces short term radioactive waste,
p44
aVand it cannot melt down.
p45
aVNow, the fuel from fusion comes from the ocean.
p46
aVIn the ocean, you can extract the fuel
p47
aVfor about one thousandth of a cent
p48
aVper kilowatt-hour, so that's very, very cheap.
p49
aVAnd if the whole planet would run on fusion,
p50
aVwe could extract the fuel from the ocean.
p51
aVIt would run for billions and billions of years.
p52
aa(lp53
VNow, if fusion is so great, why don't we have it?
p54
aVWhere is it?
p55
aVWell, there's always a bit of a catch.
p56
aVFusion is really, really hard to do.
p57
aVSo the problem is, those two nuclei,
p58
aVthey are both positively charged,
p59
aVso they don't want to fuse.
p60
aVThey go like this. They go like that.
p61
aVSo in order to make them fuse,
p62
aVyou have to throw them at each other with great speed,
p63
aVand if they have enough speed,
p64
aVthey will go against the repulsion,
p65
aVthey will touch, and they will make energy.
p66
aVNow, the particle speed
p67
aVis a measure of the temperature.
p68
aVSo the temperature required for fusion
p69
aVis 150 billion degrees C.
p70
aVThis is rather warm,
p71
aVand this is why fusion is so hard to do.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow, I caught my little fusion bug
p74
aVwhen I did my Ph.D. here at the University of British Columbia,
p75
aVand then I got a big job in a laser printer place
p76
aVmaking printing for the printing industry.
p77
aVI worked there for 10 years,
p78
aVand I got a little bit bored,
p79
aVand then I was 40, and I got a mid-life crisis,
p80
aVyou know, the usual thing:
p81
aVWho am I? What should I do?
p82
aVWhat should I do? What can I do?
p83
aVAnd then I was looking at my good work,
p84
aVand what I was doing is I was cutting the forests
p85
aVaround here in B.C.
p86
aVand burying you, all of you,
p87
aVin millions of tons of junk mail.
p88
aVNow, that was not very satisfactory.
p89
aVSo some people buy a Porsche.
p90
aVOthers get a mistress.
p91
aVBut I've decided to get my bit
p92
aVto solve global warming and make fusion happen.
p93
aa(lp94
VNow, so the first thing I did
p95
aVis I looked into the literature and I see,
p96
aVhow does fusion work?
p97
aVSo the physicists have been working on fusion for a while,
p98
aVand one of the ways they do it
p99
aVis with something called a tokamak.
p100
aVIt's a big ring of magnetic coil,
p101
aVsuperconducting coil,
p102
aVand it makes a magnetic field
p103
aVin a ring like this,
p104
aVand the hot gas in the middle,
p105
aVwhich is called a plasma, is trapped.
p106
aVThe particles go round and round and round
p107
aVthe circle at the wall.
p108
aVThen they throw a huge amount of heat in there
p109
aVto try to cook that to fusion temperature.
p110
aVSo this is the inside of one of those donuts,
p111
aVand on the right side you can see
p112
aVthe fusion plasma in there.
p113
aa(lp114
VNow, a second way of doing this
p115
aVis by using laser fusion.
p116
aVNow in laser fusion, you have a little ping pong ball,
p117
aVyou put the fusion fuel in the center,
p118
aVand you zap that with a whole bunch of laser around it.
p119
aVThe lasers are very strong, and it squashes
p120
aVthe ping pong ball really, really quick.
p121
aVAnd if you squeeze something hard enough,
p122
aVit gets hotter,
p123
aVand if it gets really, really fast,
p124
aVand they do that in one billionth of a second,
p125
aVit makes enough energy and enough heat
p126
aVto make fusion.
p127
aVSo this is the inside of one such machine.
p128
aVYou see the laser beam and the pellet
p129
aVin the center.
p130
aa(lp131
VNow, most people think that fusion is going nowhere.
p132
aVThey always think that the physicists are in their lab
p133
aVand they're working hard, but nothing is happening.
p134
aVThat's actually not quite true.
p135
aVThis is a curve of the gain in fusion
p136
aVover the last 30 years or so,
p137
aVand you can see that we're making now
p138
aVabout 10,000 times more fusion than we used to
p139
aVwhen we started.
p140
aVThat's a pretty good gain.
p141
aVAs a matter of fact, it's as fast
p142
aVas the fabled Moore's Law
p143
aVthat defined the amount of transistors
p144
aVthey can put on a chip.
p145
aVNow, this dot here is called JET,
p146
aVthe Joint European Torus.
p147
aVIt's a big tokamak donut in Europe,
p148
aVand this machine in 1997
p149
aVproduced 16 megawatts of fusion power
p150
aVwith 17 megawatts of heat.
p151
aVNow, you say, that's not much use,
p152
aVbut it's actually pretty close,
p153
aVconsidering we can get
p154
aVabout 10,000 times more than we started.
p155
aVThe second dot here is the NIF.
p156
aVIt's the National Ignition Facility.
p157
aVIt's a big laser machine in the U.S.,
p158
aVand last month they announced
p159
aVwith quite a bit of noise
p160
aVthat they had managed to make more fusion energy
p161
aVfrom the fusion
p162
aVthan the energy that they put in  the center of the ping pong ball.
p163
aVNow, that's not quite good enough,
p164
aVbecause the laser to put that energy in
p165
aVwas more energy than that,
p166
aVbut it was pretty good.
p167
aa(lp168
VNow this is ITER,
p169
aVpronounced in French: EE-tairh.
p170
aVSo this is a big collaboration of different countries
p171
aVthat are building a huge magnetic donut
p172
aVin the south of France,
p173
aVand this machine, when it's finished,
p174
aVwill produce 500 megawatts of fusion power
p175
aVwith only 50 megawatts to make it.
p176
aVSo this one is the real one.
p177
aVIt's going to work.
p178
aVThat's the kind of machine that makes energy.
p179
aa(lp180
VNow if you look at the graph, you will notice
p181
aVthat those two dots are a little bit
p182
aVon the right of the curve.
p183
aVWe kind of have fallen off the progress.
p184
aVActually, the science to make those machines
p185
aVwas really in time
p186
aVto produce fusion during that curve.
p187
aVHowever, there has been a bit of politics going on,
p188
aVand the will to do it was not there,
p189
aVso it drifted to the right.
p190
aVITER, for example, could have been built
p191
aVin 2000 or 2005,
p192
aVbut because it's a big international collaboration,
p193
aVthe politics got in and it delayed it a bit.
p194
aVFor example, it took them about three years
p195
aVto decide where to put it.
p196
aa(lp197
VNow, fusion is often criticized
p198
aVfor being a little too expensive.
p199
aVYes, it did cost
p200
aVa billion dollars or two billion dollars a year
p201
aVto make this progress.
p202
aVBut you have to compare that to the cost
p203
aVof making Moore's Law.
p204
aVThat cost way more than that.
p205
aVThe result of Moore's Law
p206
aVis this cell phone here in my pocket.
p207
aVThis cell phone, and the Internet behind it,
p208
aVcost about one trillion dollars,
p209
aVjust so I can take a selfie
p210
aVand put it on Facebook.
p211
aVThen when my dad sees that,
p212
aVhe'll be very proud.
p213
aVWe also spend about 650 billion dollars a year
p214
aVin subsidies for oil and gas
p215
aVand renewable energy.
p216
aVNow, we spend one half of a percent of that on fusion.
p217
aVSo me, personally, I don't think it's too expensive.
p218
aVI think it's actually been shortchanged,
p219
aVconsidering it can solve all our energy problems
p220
aVcleanly for the next couple of billions of years.
p221
aa(lp222
VNow I can say that, but I'm a little bit biased,
p223
aVbecause I started a fusion company
p224
aVand I don't even have a Facebook account.
p225
aVSo when I started this fusion company in 2002,
p226
aVI knew I couldn't fight with the big lads.
p227
aVThey had much more resources than me.
p228
aVSo I decided I would need to find a solution
p229
aVthat is cheaper and faster.
p230
aa(lp231
VNow magnetic and laser fusion
p232
aVare pretty good machines.
p233
aVThey are awesome pieces of technology,
p234
aVwonderful machines, and they have shown
p235
aVthat fusion can be done.
p236
aVHowever, as a power plant,
p237
aVI don't think they're very good.
p238
aVThey're way too big, way too complicated,
p239
aVway too expensive,
p240
aVand also, they don't deal very much
p241
aVwith the fusion energy.
p242
aVWhen you make fusion, the energy comes out
p243
aVas neutrons, fast neutrons comes out of the plasma.
p244
aVThose neutrons hit the wall of the machine.
p245
aVIt damages it.
p246
aVAnd also, you have to catch the heat from those neutrons
p247
aVand run some steam to spin a turbine somewhere,
p248
aVand on those machines,
p249
aVit was all a bit of an afterthought.
p250
aVSo I decided that surely there is a better way of doing that.
p251
aa(lp252
VSo back to the literature,
p253
aVand I read about the fusion everywhere.
p254
aVOne way in particular attracted my attention,
p255
aVand it's called magnetized target fusion,
p256
aVor MTF for short.
p257
aVNow, in MTF, what you want to do
p258
aVis you take a big vat
p259
aVand you fill that with liquid metal,
p260
aVand you spin the liquid metal
p261
aVto open a vortex in the center,
p262
aVa bit like your sink.
p263
aVWhen you pull the plug on a sink, it makes a vortex.
p264
aVAnd then you have some pistons driven by pressure
p265
aVthat goes on the outside,
p266
aVand this compresses the liquid metal
p267
aVaround the plasma, and it compresses it,
p268
aVit gets hotter, like a laser,
p269
aVand then it makes fusion.
p270
aVSo it's a bit of a mix
p271
aVbetween a magnetized fusion
p272
aVand the laser fusion.
p273
aVSo those have a couple of very good advantages.
p274
aVThe liquid metal absorbs all the neutrons
p275
aVand no neutrons hit the wall,
p276
aVand therefore there's no damage to the machine.
p277
aVThe liquid metal gets hot,
p278
aVso you can pump that in a heat exchanger,
p279
aVmake some steam, spin a turbine.
p280
aVSo that's a very convenient way of doing
p281
aVthis part of the process.
p282
aVAnd finally, all the energy to make the fusion happen
p283
aVcomes from steam-powered pistons,
p284
aVwhich is way cheaper than lasers
p285
aVor superconducting coils.
p286
aa(lp287
VNow, this was all very good
p288
aVexcept for the problem that it didn't quite work.
p289
aV(Laughter)
p290
aVThere's always a catch.
p291
aVSo when you compress that,
p292
aVthe plasma cools down
p293
aVfaster than the compression speed,
p294
aVso you're trying to compress it,
p295
aVbut the plasma cooled down and cooled down and cooled down
p296
aVand then it did absolutely nothing.
p297
aa(lp298
VSo when I saw that, I said, well, this is such a shame,
p299
aVbecause it's a very, very good idea.
p300
aVSo hopefully I can improve on that.
p301
aVSo I thought about it for a minute,
p302
aVand I said, okay, how can we make that work better?
p303
aVSo then I thought about impact.
p304
aVWhat about if we use a big hammer
p305
aVand we swing it and we hit the nail like this,
p306
aVin the place of putting the hammer on the nail
p307
aVand pushing and try to put it in? That won't work.
p308
aVSo what the idea is
p309
aVis to use the idea of an impact.
p310
aVSo we accelerate the pistons with steam,
p311
aVthat takes a little bit of time,
p312
aVbut then, bang! you hit the piston,
p313
aVand, baff!, all the energy is done instantly,
p314
aVdown instantly to the liquid,
p315
aVand that compresses the plasma much faster.
p316
aVSo I decided, okay, this is good, let's make that.
p317
aa(lp318
VSo we built this machine in this garage here.
p319
aVWe made a small machine
p320
aVthat we managed to squeeze
p321
aVa little bit of neutrons out of that,
p322
aVand those are my marketing neutrons,
p323
aVand with those marketing neutrons,
p324
aVthen I raised about 50 million dollars,
p325
aVand I hired 65 people. That's my team here.
p326
aVAnd this is what we want to build.
p327
aVSo it's going to be a big machine,
p328
aVabout three meters in diameter,
p329
aVliquid lead spinning around,
p330
aVbig vortex in the center,
p331
aVput the plasma on the top and on the bottom,
p332
aVpiston hits on the side,
p333
aVbang!, it compresses it,
p334
aVand it will make some energy,
p335
aVand the neutron will come out in the liquid metal,
p336
aVgoing to go in a steam engine and make the turbine,
p337
aVand some of the steam will go back
p338
aVto fire the piston.
p339
aVWe're going to run that about one time per second,
p340
aVand it will produce 100 megawatts of electricity.
p341
aa(lp342
VOkay, we also built this injector,
p343
aVso this injector makes the plasma to start with.
p344
aVIt makes the plasma at about
p345
aVa lukewarm temperature of three million degrees C.
p346
aVUnfortunately, it doesn't last quite long enough,
p347
aVso we need to extend the life of the plasma a little bit,
p348
aVbut last month it got a lot better,
p349
aVso I think we have the plasma compressing now.
p350
aVThen we built a small sphere, about this big,
p351
aV14 pistons around it,
p352
aVand this will compress the liquid.
p353
aVHowever, plasma is difficult to compress.
p354
aVWhen you compress it,
p355
aVit tends to go a little bit crooked like that,
p356
aVso you need the timing of the piston
p357
aVto be very good,
p358
aVand for that we use several control systems,
p359
aVwhich was not possible in 1970,
p360
aVbut we now can do that
p361
aVwith nice, new electronics.
p362
aa(lp363
VSo finally, most people think that fusion
p364
aVis in the future and will never happen,
p365
aVbut as a matter of fact, fusion is getting very close.
p366
aVWe are almost there.
p367
aVThe big labs have shown that fusion is doable,
p368
aVand now there are small companies that are thinking about that,
p369
aVand they say, it's not that it cannot be done,
p370
aVbut it's how to make it cost-effectively.
p371
aVGeneral Fusion is one of those small companies,
p372
aVand hopefully, very soon, somebody, someone,
p373
aVwill crack that nut,
p374
aVand perhaps it will be General Fusion.
