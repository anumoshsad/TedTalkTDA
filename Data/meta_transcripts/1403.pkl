VMany times
p4
aVI go around the world to speak,
p5
aVand people ask me questions
p6
aVabout the challenges,
p7
aVmy moments,
p8
aVsome of my regrets.
p9
aV1998:
p10
aVA single mother of four,
p11
aVthree months after the birth of my fourth child,
p12
aVI went to do a job
p13
aVas a research assistant.
p14
aVI went to Northern Liberia.
p15
aVAnd as part of the work,
p16
aVthe village would give you lodgings.
p17
aVAnd they gave me lodging with a single mother
p18
aVand her daughter.
p19
aa(lp20
VThis girl happened to be
p21
aVthe only girl in the entire village
p22
aVwho had made it
p23
aVto the ninth grade.
p24
aVShe was the laughing stock of the community.
p25
aVHer mother was often told by other women,
p26
aV"You and your child
p27
aVwill die poor."
p28
aVAfter two weeks of working in that village,
p29
aVit was time to go back.
p30
aVThe mother came to me, knelt down,
p31
aVand said, "Leymah, take my daughter.
p32
aVI wish for her
p33
aVto be a nurse."
p34
aVDirt poor, living in the home with my parents,
p35
aVI couldn't afford to.
p36
aVWith tears in my eyes,
p37
aVI said, "No."
p38
aa(lp39
VTwo months later,
p40
aVI go to another village
p41
aVon the same assignment
p42
aVand they asked me to live with the village chief.
p43
aVThe women's chief of the village has this little girl,
p44
aVfair color like me,
p45
aVtotally dirty.
p46
aVAnd all day she walked around
p47
aVonly in her underwear.
p48
aVWhen I asked, "Who is that?"
p49
aVShe said, "That's Wei.
p50
aVThe meaning of her name is pig.
p51
aVHer mother died while giving birth to her,
p52
aVand no one had any idea who her father was."
p53
aVFor two weeks, she became my companion,
p54
aVslept with me.
p55
aVI bought her used clothes
p56
aVand bought her her first doll.
p57
aVThe night before I left,
p58
aVshe came to the room
p59
aVand said, "Leymah, don't leave me here.
p60
aVI wish to go with you.
p61
aVI wish to go to school."
p62
aVDirt poor, no money,
p63
aVliving with my parents,
p64
aVI again said, "No."
p65
aVTwo months later,
p66
aVboth of those villages fell into another war.
p67
aVTill today, I have no idea
p68
aVwhere those two girls are.
p69
aa(lp70
VFast-forward, 2004:
p71
aVIn the peak of our activism,
p72
aVthe minister of Gender Liberia called me
p73
aVand said, "Leymah, I have a nine-year-old for you.
p74
aVI want you to bring her home
p75
aVbecause we don't have safe homes."
p76
aVThe story of this little girl:
p77
aVShe had been raped
p78
aVby her paternal grandfather
p79
aVevery day for six months.
p80
aVShe came to me bloated,
p81
aVvery pale.
p82
aVEvery night I'd come from work and lie on the cold floor.
p83
aVShe'd lie beside me
p84
aVand say, "Auntie, I wish to be well.
p85
aVI wish to go to school."
p86
aa(lp87
V2010:
p88
aVA young woman stands before President Sirleaf
p89
aVand gives her testimony
p90
aVof how she and her siblings live together,
p91
aVtheir father and mother died during the war.
p92
aVShe's 19; her dream is to go to college
p93
aVto be able to support them.
p94
aVShe's highly athletic.
p95
aVOne of the things that happens
p96
aVis that she applies for a scholarship.
p97
aVFull scholarship. She gets it.
p98
aVHer dream of going to school,
p99
aVher wish of being educated,
p100
aVis finally here.
p101
aVShe goes to school on the first day.
p102
aVThe director of sports
p103
aVwho's responsible for getting her into the program
p104
aVasks her to come out of class.
p105
aVAnd for the next three years,
p106
aVher fate will be
p107
aVhaving sex with him every day,
p108
aVas a favor for getting her in school.
p109
aa(lp110
VGlobally, we have policies,
p111
aVinternational instruments,
p112
aVwork leaders.
p113
aVGreat people have made commitments \u2014
p114
aVwe will protect our children
p115
aVfrom want and from fear.
p116
aVThe U.N. has the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
p117
aVCountries like America, we've heard things like No Child Left Behind.
p118
aVOther countries come with different things.
p119
aVThere is a Millennium Development called Three
p120
aVthat focuses on girls.
p121
aVAll of these great works by great people
p122
aVaimed at getting young people
p123
aVto where we want to get them globally,
p124
aVI think, has failed.
p125
aa(lp126
VIn Liberia, for example,
p127
aVthe teenage pregnancy rate
p128
aVis three to every 10 girls.
p129
aVTeen prostitution is at its peak.
p130
aVIn one community, we're told,
p131
aVyou wake up in the morning
p132
aVand see used condoms like used chewing gum paper.
p133
aVGirls as young as 12 being prostituted
p134
aVfor less than a dollar a night.
p135
aVIt's disheartening, it's sad.
p136
aVAnd then someone asked me,
p137
aVjust before my TEDTalk, a few days ago,
p138
aV"So where is the hope?"
p139
aa(lp140
VSeveral years ago, a few friends of mine
p141
aVdecided we needed to bridge the disconnect
p142
aVbetween our generation
p143
aVand the generation of young women.
p144
aVIt's not enough to say
p145
aVyou have two Nobel laureates from the Republic of Liberia
p146
aVwhen your girls' kids are totally out there
p147
aVand no hope, or seemingly no hope.
p148
aVWe created a space
p149
aVcalled the Young Girls Transformative Project.
p150
aVWe go into rural communities
p151
aVand all we do, like has been done in this room,
p152
aVis create the space.
p153
aVWhen these girls sit,
p154
aVyou unlock intelligence,
p155
aVyou unlock passion,
p156
aVyou unlock commitment,
p157
aVyou unlock focus,
p158
aVyou unlock great leaders.
p159
aVToday, we've worked with over 300.
p160
aVAnd some of those girls
p161
aVwho walked in the room very shy
p162
aVhave taken bold steps, as young mothers,
p163
aVto go out there and advocate
p164
aVfor the rights of other young women.
p165
aa(lp166
VOne young woman I met,
p167
aVteen mother of four,
p168
aVnever thought about finishing high school,
p169
aVgraduated successfully;
p170
aVnever thought about going to college,
p171
aVenrolled in college.
p172
aVOne day she said to me,
p173
aV"My wish is to finish college
p174
aVand be able to support my children."
p175
aVShe's at a place where she can't find money
p176
aVto go to school.
p177
aVShe sells water, sells soft drinks
p178
aVand sells recharge cards for cellphones.
p179
aVAnd you would think she would take that money
p180
aVand put it back into her education.
p181
aVJuanita is her name.
p182
aVShe takes that money
p183
aVand finds single mothers in her community
p184
aVto send back to school.
p185
aVSays, "Leymah, my wish
p186
aVis to be educated.
p187
aVAnd if I can't be educated,
p188
aVwhen I see some of my sisters being educated,
p189
aVmy wish has been fulfilled.
p190
aVI wish for a better life.
p191
aVI wish for food for my children.
p192
aVI wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop."
p193
aVThis is the dream of the African girl.
p194
aa(lp195
VSeveral years ago,
p196
aVthere was one African girl.
p197
aVThis girl had a son
p198
aVwho wished for a piece of doughnut
p199
aVbecause he was extremely hungry.
p200
aVAngry, frustrated,
p201
aVreally upset
p202
aVabout the state of her society
p203
aVand the state of her children,
p204
aVthis young girl started a movement,
p205
aVa movement of ordinary women
p206
aVbanding together
p207
aVto build peace.
p208
aVI will fulfill the wish.
p209
aVThis is another African girl's wish.
p210
aVI failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls.
p211
aVI failed to do this.
p212
aVThese were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman \u2014
p213
aVI failed, I failed, I failed.
p214
aVSo I will do this.
p215
aVWomen came out,
p216
aVprotested a brutal dictator,
p217
aVfearlessly spoke.
p218
aVNot only did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true,
p219
aVthe wish of peace came true.
p220
aVThis young woman
p221
aVwished also to go to school.
p222
aVShe went to school.
p223
aVThis young woman wished for other things to happen,
p224
aVit happened for her.
p225
aa(lp226
VToday, this young woman is me,
p227
aVa Nobel laureate.
p228
aVI'm now on a journey
p229
aVto fulfill the wish,
p230
aVin my tiny capacity,
p231
aVof little African girls \u2014
p232
aVthe wish of being educated.
p233
aVWe set up a foundation.
p234
aVWe're giving full four-year scholarships
p235
aVto girls from villages that we see with potential.
p236
aa(lp237
VI don't have much to ask of you.
p238
aVI've also been to places in this U.S.,
p239
aVand I know that girls in this country
p240
aValso have wishes,
p241
aVa wish for a better life somewhere in the Bronx,
p242
aVa wish for a better life
p243
aVsomewhere in downtown L.A.,
p244
aVa wish for a better life somewhere in Texas,
p245
aVa wish for a better life somewhere in New York,
p246
aVa wish for a better life
p247
aVsomewhere in New Jersey.
p248
aa(lp249
VWill you journey with me
p250
aVto help that girl,
p251
aVbe it an African girl or an American girl
p252
aVor a Japanese girl,
p253
aVfulfill her wish,
p254
aVfulfill her dream,
p255
aVachieve that dream?
p256
aVBecause all of these
p257
aVgreat innovators and inventors
p258
aVthat we've talked to and seen
p259
aVover the last few days
p260
aVare also sitting in tiny corners
p261
aVin different parts of the world,
p262
aVand all they're asking us to do
p263
aVis create that space
p264
aVto unlock the intelligence,
p265
aVunlock the passion,
p266
aVunlock all of the great things
p267
aVthat they hold within themselves.
p268
aVLet's journey together. Let's journey together.
p269
aa(lp270
VThank you.
p271
aa(lp272
V(Applause)
p273
aa(lp274
VChris Anderson: Thank you so much.
p275
aVRight now in Liberia,
p276
aVwhat do you see
p277
aVas the main issue that troubles you?
p278
aa(lp279
VLG: I've been asked to lead
p280
aVthe Liberian Reconciliation Initiative.
p281
aVAs part of my work,
p282
aVI'm doing these tours
p283
aVin different villages and towns \u2014
p284
aV13, 15 hours on dirt roads \u2014
p285
aVand there is no community that I've gone into
p286
aVthat I haven't seen intelligent girls.
p287
aVBut sadly,
p288
aVthe vision of a great future,
p289
aVor the dream of a great future,
p290
aVis just a dream,
p291
aVbecause you have all of these vices.
p292
aVTeen pregnancy, like I said, is epidemic.
p293
aa(lp294
VSo what troubles me
p295
aVis that I was at that place
p296
aVand somehow I'm at this place,
p297
aVand I just don't want to be the only one
p298
aVat this place.
p299
aVI'm looking for ways
p300
aVfor other girls to be with me.
p301
aVI want to look back 20 years from now
p302
aVand see that there's another Liberian girl,
p303
aVGhanaian girl, Nigerian girl, Ethiopian girl
p304
aVstanding on this TED stage.
p305
aVAnd maybe, just maybe, saying,
p306
aV"Because of that Nobel laureate
p307
aVI'm here today."
p308
aVSo I'm troubled
p309
aVwhen I see them like there's no hope.
p310
aVBut I'm also not pessimistic,
p311
aVbecause I know it doesn't take a lot
p312
aVto get them charged up.
p313
aa(lp314
VCA: And in the last year,
p315
aVtell us one hopeful thing
p316
aVthat you've seen happening.
p317
aa(lp318
VLG: I can tell you many hopeful things that I've seen happening.
p319
aVBut in the last year,
p320
aVwhere President Sirleaf comes from, her village,
p321
aVwe went there to work with these girls.
p322
aVAnd we could not find 25 girls
p323
aVin high school.
p324
aVAll of these girls went to the gold mine,
p325
aVand they were predominantly prostitutes
p326
aVdoing other things.
p327
aVWe took 50 of those girls
p328
aVand we worked with them.
p329
aVAnd this was at the beginning of elections.
p330
aVThis is one place where women were never \u2014
p331
aVeven the older ones
p332
aVbarely sat in the circle with the men.
p333
aVThese girls banded together and formed a group
p334
aVand launched a campaign
p335
aVfor voter registration.
p336
aVThis is a real rural village.
p337
aVAnd the theme they used was:
p338
aV"Even pretty girls vote."
p339
aVThey were able to mobilize young women.
p340
aa(lp341
VBut not only did they do that,
p342
aVthey went to those who were running for seats
p343
aVto ask them, "What is it
p344
aVthat you will give the girls of this community
p345
aVwhen you win?"
p346
aVAnd one of the guys
p347
aVwho already had a seat was very \u2014
p348
aVbecause Liberia has one of the strongest rape laws,
p349
aVand he was one of those really fighting in parliament
p350
aVto overturn that law
p351
aVbecause he called it barbaric.
p352
aVRape is not barbaric, but the law, he said, was barbaric.
p353
aVAnd when the girls started engaging him,
p354
aVhe was very hostile towards them.
p355
aVThese little girls turned to him and said,
p356
aV"We will vote you out of office."
p357
aVHe's out of office today.
p358
aa(lp359

p360
