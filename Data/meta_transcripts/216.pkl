VI'm here to enlist you
p4
aVin helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things done.
p5
aVHere is the old story \u2014 we've already heard a little bit about it:
p6
aVbiology is war in which only the fiercest survive;
p7
aVbusinesses and nations succeed only by defeating,
p8
aVdestroying and dominating competition;
p9
aa(lp10
Vpolitics is about your side winning at all costs.
p11
aVBut I think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge.
p12
aVIt's a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines,
p13
aVin which cooperation, collective action and complex interdependencies
p14
aVplay a more important role.
p15
aVAnd the central, but not all-important, role of competition and survival of the fittest
p16
aVshrinks just a little bit to make room.
p17
aa(lp18
VI started thinking about the relationship between communication, media
p19
aVand collective action when I wrote "Smart Mobs,"
p20
aVand I found that when I finished the book, I kept thinking about it.
p21
aVIn fact, if you look back, human communication media
p22
aVand the ways in which we organize socially have been co-evolving for quite a long time.
p23
aVHumans have lived for much, much longer
p24
aVthan the approximately 10,000 years of settled agricultural civilization
p25
aa(lp26
Vin small family groups. Nomadic hunters bring down rabbits, gathering food.
p27
aVThe form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive.
p28
aVBut at some point, they banded together to hunt bigger game.
p29
aVAnd we don't know exactly how they did this,
p30
aValthough they must have solved some collective action problems;
p31
aVit only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons
p32
aVwhile you're fighting with the other groups.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd again, we have no way of knowing,
p35
aVbut it's clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged.
p36
aVMore protein than a hunter's family could eat before it rotted.
p37
aVSo that raised a social question
p38
aVthat I believe must have driven new social forms.
p39
aVDid the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something
p40
aVto the hunters and their families?
p41
aVAnd if so, how did they make arrangements?
p42
aVAgain, we can't know, but we can be pretty sure that some form of
p43
aVsymbolic communication must have been involved.
p44
aa(lp45
VOf course, with agriculture came the first big civilizations,
p46
aVthe first cities built of mud and brick, the first empires.
p47
aVAnd it was the administers of these empires
p48
aVwho began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed
p49
aVand the taxes that was owed on them
p50
aVby making marks; marks on clay in that time.
p51
aa(lp52
VNot too much longer after that, the alphabet was invented.
p53
aVAnd this powerful tool was really reserved, for thousands of years,
p54
aVfor the elite administrators (Laughter) who kept track of accounts for the empires.
p55
aVAnd then another communication technology enabled new media:
p56
aVthe printing press came along, and within decades,
p57
aVmillions of people became literate.
p58
aVAnd from literate populations,
p59
aVnew forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge,
p60
aVreligion and politics.
p61
aVWe saw scientific revolutions, the Protestant Reformation,
p62
aVconstitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before.
p63
aVNot created by the printing press,
p64
aVbut enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy.
p65
aVAnd again, new forms of wealth emerged.
p66
aa(lp67
VNow, commerce is ancient. Markets are as old as the crossroads.
p68
aVBut capitalism, as we know it, is only a few hundred years old,
p69
aVenabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies,
p70
aVsuch as the joint-stock ownership company,
p71
aVshared liability insurance, double-entry bookkeeping.
p72
aa(lp73
VNow of course, the enabling technologies are based on the Internet,
p74
aVand in the many-to-many era, every desktop is now a printing press,
p75
aVa broadcasting station, a community or a marketplace.
p76
aVEvolution is speeding up.
p77
aVMore recently, that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops,
p78
aVand very, very quickly, we're going to see a significant proportion, if not the majority of
p79
aVthe human race, walking around holding, carrying or wearing supercomputers
p80
aVlinked at speeds greater
p81
aVthan what we consider to be broadband today.
p82
aa(lp83
VNow, when I started looking into collective action,
p84
aVthe considerable literature on it is based on what sociologists call "social dilemmas."
p85
aVAnd there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas.
p86
aVI'm going to talk briefly about two of them:
p87
aVthe prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons.
p88
aa(lp89
VNow, when I talked about this with Kevin Kelly,
p90
aVhe assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details
p91
aVof the prisoner's dilemma,
p92
aVso I'm just going to go over that very, very quickly.
p93
aVIf you have more questions about it, ask Kevin Kelly later. (Laughter)
p94
aa(lp95
VThe prisoner's dilemma is actually a story that's overlaid
p96
aVon a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory
p97
aVin the early years of thinking about nuclear war:
p98
aVtwo players who couldn't trust each other.
p99
aVLet me just say that every unsecured transaction
p100
aVis a good example of a prisoner's dilemma.
p101
aVPerson with the goods, person with the money,
p102
aVbecause they can't trust each other, are not going to exchange.
p103
aVNeither one wants to be the first one
p104
aVor they're going to get the sucker's payoff,
p105
aVbut both lose, of course, because they don't get what they want.
p106
aVIf they could only agree, if they could only turn a prisoner's dilemma into
p107
aVa different payoff matrix called an assurance game, they could proceed.
p108
aa(lp109
VTwenty years ago, Robert Axelrod used the prisoner's dilemma
p110
aVas a probe of the biological question:
p111
aVif we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors,
p112
aVhow does cooperation exist at all?
p113
aVHe started a computer tournament for
p114
aVpeople to submit prisoner's dilemma strategies and discovered,
p115
aVmuch to his surprise, that a very, very simple strategy won \u2014
p116
aVit won the first tournament, and even after everyone knew it won,
p117
aVit won the second tournament \u2014 that's known as tit for tat.
p118
aa(lp119
VAnother economic game that may not be as well known as the prisoner's dilemma
p120
aVis the ultimatum game,
p121
aVand it's also a very interesting probe of
p122
aVour assumptions about the way people make economic transactions.
p123
aVHere's how the game is played: there are two players;
p124
aVthey've never played the game before,
p125
aVthey will not play the game again, they don't know each other,
p126
aVand they are, in fact, in separate rooms.
p127
aVFirst player is offered a hundred dollars
p128
aVand is asked to propose a split: 50/50, 90/10,
p129
aVwhatever that player wants to propose. The second player either accepts the split \u2014
p130
aVboth players are paid and the game is over \u2014
p131
aVor rejects the split \u2014 neither player is paid and the game is over.
p132
aa(lp133
VNow, the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics
p134
aVwould tell you it's irrational to reject a dollar
p135
aVbecause someone you don't know in another room is going to get 99.
p136
aVYet in thousands of trials with American and European and Japanese students,
p137
aVa significant percentage would reject any offer that's not close to 50/50.
p138
aVAnd although they were screened and didn't know about the game
p139
aVand had never played the game before,
p140
aVproposers seemed to innately know this
p141
aVbecause the average proposal was surprisingly close to 50/50.
p142
aa(lp143
VNow, the interesting part comes in more recently
p144
aVwhen anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures
p145
aVand discovered, to their surprise,
p146
aVthat slash-and-burn agriculturalists in the Amazon
p147
aVor nomadic pastoralists in Central Asia or a dozen different cultures \u2014
p148
aVeach had radically different ideas of what is fair.
p149
aVWhich suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness,
p150
aVthat somehow the basis of our economic
p151
aVtransactions can be influenced by our social institutions,
p152
aVwhether we know that or not.
p153
aa(lp154
VThe other major narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons.
p155
aVGarrett Hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s.
p156
aVHe used the example of a common grazing area in which each person
p157
aVby simply maximizing their own flock
p158
aVled to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource.
p159
aVHe had the rather gloomy conclusion that
p160
aVhumans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource
p161
aVin which people cannot be restrained from using it.
p162
aa(lp163
VNow, Elinor Ostrom, a political scientist, in
p164
aV1990 asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask,
p165
aVwhich is: is it really true that humans will always despoil commons?
p166
aVSo she went out and looked at what data she could find.
p167
aVShe looked at thousands of cases of humans sharing watersheds,
p168
aVforestry resources, fisheries, and discovered that yes, in case after case,
p169
aVhumans destroyed the commons that they depended on.
p170
aVBut she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner's dilemma;
p171
aVin fact, the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma.
p172
aVAnd she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be.
p173
aVThey escape by creating institutions for collective action.
p174
aVAnd she discovered, I think most interestingly,
p175
aVthat among those institutions that worked,
p176
aVthere were a number of common design
p177
aVprinciples, and those principles seem to be
p178
aVmissing from those institutions that don't work.
p179
aa(lp180
VI'm moving very quickly over a number of
p181
aVdisciplines. In biology, the notions of symbiosis,
p182
aVgroup selection, evolutionary psychology are contested, to be sure.
p183
aVBut there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that
p184
aVcooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role
p185
aVin biology, from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology.
p186
aVAnd again, our notions of individuals as economic beings
p187
aVhave been overturned.
p188
aVRational self-interest is not always the dominating factor.
p189
aVIn fact, people will act to punish cheaters, even at a cost to themselves.
p190
aa(lp191
VAnd most recently, neurophysiological measures
p192
aVhave shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games
p193
aVshow activity in the reward centers of their brain.
p194
aVWhich led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment
p195
aVmay be the glue that holds societies together.
p196
aa(lp197
VNow, I've been talking about how new forms of communication and new media
p198
aVin the past have helped create new economic forms.
p199
aVCommerce is ancient. Markets are very old. Capitalism is fairly recent;
p200
aVsocialism emerged as a reaction to that.
p201
aVAnd yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging.
p202
aVJim Surowiecki briefly mentioned Yochai Benkler's paper about open source,
p203
aVpointing to a new form of production: peer-to-peer production.
p204
aVI simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past, new forms of cooperation
p205
aVenabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth,
p206
aVwe may be moving into yet another economic form
p207
aVthat is significantly different from previous ones.
p208
aa(lp209
VVery briefly, let's look at some businesses. IBM, as you know, HP, Sun \u2014
p210
aVsome of the most fierce competitors in the IT world are open sourcing
p211
aVtheir software, are providing portfolios of patents for the commons.
p212
aVEli Lilly \u2014 in, again, the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world \u2014
p213
aVhas created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problems.
p214
aVToyota, instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace,
p215
aVtreats them as a network and trains them to produce better,
p216
aVeven though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors.
p217
aVNow none of these companies are doing this out of altruism;
p218
aVthey're doing it because they're learning that
p219
aVa certain kind of sharing is in their self-interest.
p220
aa(lp221
VOpen source production has shown us that world-class software, like Linux and Mozilla,
p222
aVcan be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm
p223
aVnor the incentives of the marketplace as we've known them.
p224
aVGoogle enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through AdSense.
p225
aVAmazon has opened its Application Programming Interface
p226
aVto 60,000 developers, countless Amazon shops.
p227
aVThey're enriching others, not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves.
p228
aVeBay solved the prisoner's dilemma and created a market
p229
aVwhere none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism
p230
aVthat turns a prisoner's dilemma game into an assurance game.
p231
aa(lp232
VInstead of, "Neither of us can trust each other, so we have to make suboptimal moves,"
p233
aVit's, "You prove to me that you are trustworthy and I will cooperate."
p234
aVWikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia
p235
aVwith a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of years.
p236
aa(lp237
VWe've seen that ThinkCycle has enabled NGOs in developing countries
p238
aVto put up problems to be solved by design students around the world,
p239
aVincluding something that's being used for tsunami relief right now:
p240
aVit's a mechanism for rehydrating
p241
aVcholera victims that's so simple to use it,
p242
aVilliterates can be trained to use it.
p243
aVBitTorrent turns every downloader into an uploader,
p244
aVmaking the system more efficient the more it is used.
p245
aa(lp246
VMillions of people have contributed their desktop computers
p247
aVwhen they're not using them to link together through the Internet
p248
aVinto supercomputing collectives
p249
aVthat help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers \u2014
p250
aVthat's Folding@home at Stanford \u2014
p251
aVto crack codes, to search for life in outer space.
p252
aa(lp253
VI don't think we know enough yet.
p254
aVI don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are,
p255
aVbut I think we can begin to think about them.
p256
aVAnd I don't have enough time to talk about all of them,
p257
aVbut think about self-interest.
p258
aVThis is all about self-interest that adds up to more.
p259
aVIn El Salvador, both sides that withdrew from their civil war
p260
aVtook moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner's dilemma strategy.
p261
aa(lp262
VIn the U.S., in the Philippines, in Kenya, around the world,
p263
aVcitizens have self-organized political protests and
p264
aVget out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and SMS.
p265
aVIs an Apollo Project of cooperation possible?
p266
aVA transdisciplinary study of cooperation?
p267
aVI believe that the payoff would be very big.
p268
aVI think we need to begin developing maps of this territory
p269
aVso that we can talk about it across disciplines.
p270
aVAnd I am not saying that understanding cooperation
p271
aVis going to cause us to be better people \u2014
p272
aVand sometimes people cooperate to do bad things \u2014
p273
aVbut I will remind you that a few hundred years ago,
p274
aVpeople saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought
p275
aVwere caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits.
p276
aa(lp277
VDescartes said we need an entire new way of thinking.
p278
aVWhen the scientific method provided that new way of thinking
p279
aVand biology showed that microorganisms caused disease,
p280
aVsuffering was alleviated.
p281
aVWhat forms of suffering could be alleviated,
p282
aVwhat forms of wealth could be created
p283
aVif we knew a little bit more about cooperation?
p284
aVI don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse
p285
aVis automatically going to happen;
p286
aVit's going to require effort.
p287
aVSo I enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started.
p288
aVThank you.
