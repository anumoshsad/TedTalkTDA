(lp3
VThank you so much everyone from TED, and Chris and Amy in particular.
p4
aVI cannot believe I'm here.
p5
aVI have not slept in weeks.
p6
aVNeil and I were sitting there comparing how little we've slept
p7
aVin anticipation for this. I've never been so nervous \u2014
p8
aVand I do this when I'm nervous, I just realized. (Laughter)
p9
aVSo, I'm going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization
p10
aVcalled 826 Valencia, and then I'm going to talk
p11
aVabout how we all might join in and do similar things.
p12
aa(lp13
VBack in about 2000, I was living in Brooklyn,
p14
aVI was trying to finish my first book,
p15
aVI was wandering around dazed every day
p16
aVbecause I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.
p17
aVSo I would walk around in a daze during the day.
p18
aVI had no mental acuity to speak of during the day, but I had flexible hours.
p19
aVIn the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in, Park Slope,
p20
aVthere are a lot of writers \u2014
p21
aVit's like a very high per capita ratio
p22
aVof writers to normal people.
p23
aVMeanwhile, I had grown up around a lot of teachers.
p24
aVMy mom was a teacher, my sister became a teacher
p25
aVand after college so many of my friends went into teaching.
p26
aVAnd so I was always hearing them talk about their lives
p27
aVand how inspiring they were,
p28
aVand they were really sort of the most hard-working
p29
aVand constantly inspiring people I knew.
p30
aa(lp31
VBut I knew so many of the things they were up against,
p32
aVso many of the struggles they were dealing with.
p33
aVAnd one of them was that so many of my friends
p34
aVthat were teaching in city schools were having trouble
p35
aVwith their students keeping up at grade level,
p36
aVin their reading and writing in particular.
p37
aVNow, so many of these students had come from households
p38
aVwhere English isn't spoken in the home,
p39
aVwhere a lot of them have different special needs,
p40
aVlearning disabilities. And of course they're working in schools
p41
aVwhich sometimes and very often are under-funded.
p42
aVAnd so they would talk to me about this and say,
p43
aV"You know, what we really need is just more people,
p44
aVmore bodies, more one-on-one attention,
p45
aVmore hours, more expertise from people
p46
aVthat have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one."
p47
aa(lp48
VNow, I would say, "Well, why don't you just work with them one-on-one?"
p49
aVAnd they would say, "Well, we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each.
p50
aVThis can lead up to 150, 180, 200 students a day.
p51
aVHow can we possibly give each student
p52
aVeven one hour a week of one-on-one attention?"
p53
aVYou'd have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers.
p54
aVAnd so we started talking about this.
p55
aVAnd at the same time,
p56
aVI thought about this massive group of people I knew:
p57
aVwriters, editors, journalists, graduate students,
p58
aVassistant professors, you name it.
p59
aVAll these people that had sort of flexible daily hours
p60
aVand an interest in the English word \u2014
p61
aVI hope to have an interest in the English language,
p62
aVbut I'm not speaking it well right now. (Laughter)
p63
aVI'm trying. That clock has got me.
p64
aVBut everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word
p65
aVin terms of nurturing a democracy, nurturing an enlightened life.
p66
aVAnd so they had, you know, their time
p67
aVand their interest, but at the same time
p68
aVthere wasn't a conduit that I knew of in my community
p69
aVto bring these two communities together.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo when I moved back to San Francisco, we rented this building.
p72
aVAnd the idea was to put McSweeney's \u2014
p73
aVMcSweeney's Quarterly, that we published twice or three times a year,
p74
aVand a few other magazines \u2014
p75
aVwe were going to move it into an office for the first time.
p76
aVIt used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn.
p77
aVWe were going to move it into an office,
p78
aVand we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center.
p79
aVSo we thought, "We'll have all these writers and editors and everybody \u2014
p80
aVsort of a writing community \u2014 coming into the office every day anyway,
p81
aVwhy don't we just open up
p82
aVthe front of the building for students to come in there after school,
p83
aVget extra help on their written homework,
p84
aVso you have basically no border between these two communities?"
p85
aVSo the idea was that we would be
p86
aVworking on whatever we're working on,
p87
aVat 2:30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you're doing,
p88
aVor you trade, or you work a little bit later or whatever it is.
p89
aVYou give those hours in the afternoon
p90
aVto the students in the neighborhood.
p91
aa(lp92
VSo, we had this place, we rented it,
p93
aVthe landlord was all for it. We did this mural,
p94
aVthat's a Chris Ware mural, that basically explains the entire history
p95
aVof the printed word, in mural form \u2014 it takes a long time
p96
aVto digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road.
p97
aVSo we rented this space.
p98
aVAnd everything was great except the landlord said,
p99
aV"Well, the space is zoned for retail; you have to come up with something.
p100
aVYou've gotta sell something.
p101
aVYou can't just have a tutoring center."
p102
aVSo we thought, "Ha ha! Really!"
p103
aVAnd we couldn't think of anything necessarily to sell,
p104
aVbut we did all the necessary research.
p105
aVIt used to be a weight room, so there were rubber floors below,
p106
aVacoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights.
p107
aVWe took all that down, and we found beautiful wooden floors,
p108
aVwhitewashed beams and it had the look \u2014
p109
aVwhile we were renovating this place, somebody said,
p110
aV"You know, it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship."
p111
aVAnd we looked around and somebody else said,
p112
aV"Well, you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer." (Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VAnd so this is what we did. So it made everybody laugh,
p115
aVand we said, "There's a point to that.
p116
aVLet's sell pirate supplies." This is the pirate supply store.
p117
aVYou see, this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin.
p118
aVA great carpenter built all this stuff and you see,
p119
aVwe made it look sort of pirate supply-like.
p120
aVHere you see planks sold by the foot
p121
aVand we have supplies to combat scurvy.
p122
aVWe have the peg legs there, that are all handmade and fitted to you.
p123
aVUp at the top, you see the eyepatch display,
p124
aVwhich is the black column there for everyday use
p125
aVfor your eyepatch, and then you have the pastel
p126
aVand other colors for stepping out at night \u2014
p127
aVspecial occasions, bar mitzvahs and whatever.
p128
aa(lp129
VSo we opened this place. And this is a vat
p130
aVthat we fill with treasures that students dig in.
p131
aVThis is replacement eyes in case you lose one.
p132
aVThese are some signs that we have all over the place:
p133
aV"Practical Joking with Pirates."
p134
aVWhile you're reading the sign, we pull a rope behind the counter
p135
aVand eight mop heads drop on your head.
p136
aVThat was just my one thing \u2014 I said we had to have something that drops on people's heads.
p137
aVIt became mop heads. And this is the fish theater,
p138
aVwhich is just a saltwater tank with three seats,
p139
aVand then right behind it we set up this space,
p140
aVwhich was the tutoring center.
p141
aVSo right there is the tutoring center,
p142
aVand then behind the curtain were the McSweeney's offices,
p143
aVwhere all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that.
p144
aa(lp145
VThe kids would come in \u2014
p146
aVor we thought they would come in. I should back up.
p147
aVWe set the place up, we opened up, we spent months and months
p148
aVrenovating this place.
p149
aVWe had tables, chairs, computers, everything.
p150
aVI went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto
p151
aVand I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle.
p152
aVAnyway, we bought 'em, we set everything up and then we waited.
p153
aVIt was started with about 12 of my friends,
p154
aVpeople that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood.
p155
aVAnd we sat. And at 2:30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk
p156
aVand it just said, "Free Tutoring for Your English-Related
p157
aVand Writing-Related Needs \u2014 Just Come In, It's All Free."
p158
aVAnd we thought, "Oh, they're going to storm the gates,
p159
aVthey're gonna love it." And they didn't.
p160
aVAnd so we waited, we sat at the tables, we waited and waited.
p161
aVAnd everybody was becoming very discouraged
p162
aVbecause it was weeks and weeks that we waited, really, where nobody came in.
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd then somebody alerted us to the fact
p165
aVthat maybe there was a trust gap,
p166
aVbecause we were operating behind a pirate supply store. (Laughter)
p167
aVWe never put it together, you know?
p168
aVAnd so then, around that time, I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari,
p169
aVa longtime San Francisco educator \u2014
p170
aVshe was teaching in Mexico City,
p171
aVshe had all the experience necessary,
p172
aVknew everything about education,
p173
aVwas connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood \u2014
p174
aVI convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching.
p175
aVShe took over as executive director.
p176
aVImmediately, she made the inroads with the teachers
p177
aVand the parents and the students and everything,
p178
aVand so suddenly it was actually full every day.
p179
aa(lp180
VAnd what we were trying to offer every day
p181
aVwas one-on-one attention.
p182
aVThe goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students.
p183
aVYou know, it's been proven
p184
aVthat 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention,
p185
aVa student can get one grade level higher.
p186
aVAnd so most of these students, English is not spoken in the home.
p187
aVThey come there, many times their parents \u2014
p188
aVyou can't see it, but there's a church pew
p189
aVthat I bought in a Berkeley auction right there \u2014
p190
aVthe parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored.
p191
aVSo that was the basis of it,
p192
aVwas one-on-one attention.
p193
aVAnd we found ourselves full every day with kids.
p194
aVIf you're on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m.,
p195
aV2:30 p.m., you will get run over, often,
p196
aVby the kids and their big backpacks, or whatever, actually running to this space,
p197
aa(lp198
Vwhich is very strange, because it's school, in a way.
p199
aVBut there was something psychological happening there
p200
aVthat was just a little bit different.
p201
aVAnd the other thing was, there was no stigma.
p202
aVKids weren't going into the "Center-for-Kids-That-Need-More-Help,"
p203
aVor something like that. It was 826 Valencia.
p204
aVFirst of all, it was a pirate supply store, which is insane.
p205
aVAnd then secondly, there's a publishing company in the back.
p206
aVAnd so our interns were actually working
p207
aVat the same tables very often,
p208
aVand shoulder-to-shoulder, computer-next-to-computer with the students.
p209
aa(lp210
VAnd so it became a tutoring center \u2014
p211
aVpublishing center, is what we called it \u2014
p212
aVand a writing center.
p213
aVThey go in, and they might be working with a high school student
p214
aVactually working on a novel \u2014 because we had very gifted kids, too.
p215
aVSo there's no stigma.
p216
aVThey're all working next to each other. It's all a creative endeavor.
p217
aVThey're seeing adults. They're modeling their behavior.
p218
aVThese adults, they're working in their field.
p219
aVThey can lean over, ask a question of one of these adults
p220
aVand it all sort of feeds on each other.
p221
aVThere's a lot of cross-pollination. The only problem,
p222
aVespecially for the adults working at McSweeney's
p223
aVwho hadn't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up,
p224
aVwas that there was just the one bathroom. (Laughter)
p225
aVWith like 60 kids a day, this is a problem.
p226
aa(lp227
VBut you know, there's something about the kids finishing their homework
p228
aVin a given day, working one-on-one, getting all this attention \u2014
p229
aVthey go home, they're finished. They don't stall.
p230
aVThey don't do their homework in front of the TV.
p231
aVThey're allowed to go home at 5:30 p.m., enjoy their family,
p232
aVenjoy other hobbies, get outside, play.
p233
aVAnd that makes a happy family.
p234
aVA bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community.
p235
aVA bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world.
p236
aVSo the key to it all is homework! (Laughter) (Applause)
p237
aVThere you have it, you know \u2014 one-on-one attention.
p238
aa(lp239
VSo we started off with about 12 volunteers,
p240
aVand then we had about 50,
p241
aVand then a couple hundred.
p242
aVAnd we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster.
p243
aVAnd we make it incredibly easy to volunteer.
p244
aVThe key thing is, even if you only have a couple of hours a month,
p245
aVthose two hours shoulder-to-shoulder,
p246
aVnext to one student, concentrated attention,
p247
aVshining this beam of light on their work,
p248
aVon their thoughts and their self-expression,
p249
aVis going to be absolutely transformative,
p250
aVbecause so many of the students have not had that ever before.
p251
aVSo we said, "Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months,
p252
aVit doesn't matter. That's going to be enough."
p253
aVSo that's partly why the tutor corps grew so fast.
p254
aa(lp255
VThen we said, "Well, what are we
p256
aVgoing to do with the space during the day,
p257
aVbecause it has to be used before 2:30 p.m.?"
p258
aVSo we started bringing in classes during the day.
p259
aVSo every day, there's a field trip where they together create a book \u2014
p260
aVyou can see it being typed up above.
p261
aVThis is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing.
p262
aVYou just point a camera at a class,
p263
aVand it always looks like this.
p264
aVSo this is one of the books that they do.
p265
aVNotice the title of the book,
p266
aV"The Book That Was Never Checked Out: Titanic."
p267
aVAnd the first line of that book is, "Once there was a book named Cindy
p268
aVthat was about the Titanic."
p269
aVSo, meanwhile, there's an adult in the back typing this up,
p270
aVtaking it completely seriously, which blows their mind.
p271
aa(lp272
VSo then we still had more tutors to use.
p273
aVThis is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events.
p274
aVThe teachers that we work with \u2014
p275
aVand everything is different to teachers \u2014 they tell us what to do.
p276
aVWe went in there thinking,
p277
aV"We're ultimately, completely malleable. You're going to tell us.
p278
aVThe neighborhood's going to tell us, the parents are going to tell us.
p279
aVThe teachers are going to tell us how we're most useful."
p280
aa(lp281
VSo then they said, "Why don't you come into the schools?
p282
aVBecause what about the students that wouldn't come to you,
p283
aVnecessarily, who don't have really active parents that are bringing them in,
p284
aVor aren't close enough?" So then we started saying,
p285
aV"Well, we've got 1,400 people on our tutor roster.
p286
aVLet's just put out the word." A teacher will say,
p287
aV"I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays.
p288
aVWe're working on our college essays. Send them in."
p289
aVSo we put that out on the wire: 1,400 tutors.
p290
aVWhoever can make it signs up. They go in about a half an hour before the class.
p291
aVThe teacher tells them what to do,
p292
aVhow to do it, what their training is, what their project is so far.
p293
aVThey work under the teacher's guide,
p294
aVand it's all in one big room.
p295
aVAnd that's actually the brunt of what we do is,
p296
aVpeople going straight from their workplace, straight from home,
p297
aVstraight into the classroom and
p298
aVworking directly with the students.
p299
aVSo then we're able to work with thousands and thousands of more students.
p300
aVThen another school said, "Well, what if we
p301
aVjust give you a classroom and you can staff it all day?"
p302
aa(lp303
VSo this is the Everett Middle School Writers' Room,
p304
aVwhere we decorated it in buccaneer style.
p305
aVIt's right off the library. And there we serve
p306
aVall 529 kids in this middle school.
p307
aVThis is their newspaper, the "Straight-Up News,"
p308
aVthat has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom
p309
aVin both languages \u2014 English and Spanish.
p310
aVSo then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said,
p311
aV"Hey, why don't you assign a book with high school students?
p312
aVI want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world."
p313
aVAnd so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School,
p314
aVwhich is a school that we had worked with on some other things,
p315
aVand we gave that assignment to the students.
p316
aVAnd we said, "Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end.
p317
aVShe's going to publish them in a book.
p318
aVShe's going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form.
p319
aVIt's going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area
p320
aVand throughout the world, on Amazon and you name it."
p321
aVSo these kids worked harder
p322
aVthan they've ever worked on anything in their lives,
p323
aVbecause there was that outside audience,
p324
aVthere was Isabel Allende on the other end.
p325
aVI think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them
p326
aVand so this worked out incredibly well.
p327
aVWe had a big party at the end.
p328
aVThis is a book that you can find anywhere. So that led to a series of these.
p329
aVYou can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one,
p330
aV"I Might Get Somewhere."
p331
aVAnd this became an ongoing thing. More and more books.
p332
aa(lp333
VNow we're sort of addicted to the book thing.
p334
aVThe kids will work harder than they've ever worked in their life
p335
aVif they know it's going to be permanent,
p336
aVknow it's going to be on a shelf,
p337
aVknow that nobody can diminish what they've thought and said,
p338
aVthat we've honored their words, honored their thoughts
p339
aVwith hundreds of hours of five drafts, six drafts \u2014
p340
aVall this attention that we give to their thoughts.
p341
aVAnd once they achieve that level, once they've written at that level,
p342
aVthey can never go back.
p343
aVIt's absolutely transformative.
p344
aVAnd so then they're all sold in the store. This is near the planks.
p345
aVWe sell all the student books.
p346
aVWhere else would you put them, right?
p347
aVSo we sell 'em, and then something weird had been happening
p348
aVwith the stores. The store, actually \u2014
p349
aVeven though we started out as just a gag \u2014 the store actually made money.
p350
aVSo it was paying the rent.
p351
aVAnd maybe this is just a San Francisco thing \u2014
p352
aVI don't know, I don't want to judge.
p353
aVBut people would come in \u2014
p354
aVand this was before the pirate movies and everything!
p355
aVIt was making a lot of money. Not a lot of money,
p356
aVbut it was paying the rent, paying a full-time staff member there.
p357
aVThere's the ocean maps you can see on the left.
p358
aa(lp359
VAnd it became a gateway to the community.
p360
aVPeople would come in and say, "What the \u2014?
p361
aVWhat is this?" I don't want to swear on the web. (Laughter)
p362
aVIs that a rule? I don't know.
p363
aVThey would say, "What is this?"
p364
aVAnd people would come in and learn more about it.
p365
aVAnd then right beyond \u2014 there's usually a little chain there \u2014
p366
aVright beyond, they would see the kids being tutored.
p367
aVThis is a field trip going on. And so they would be shopping,
p368
aVand they might be more likely to buy some lard,
p369
aVor millet for their parrot, or, you know, a hook,
p370
aVor hook protector for nighttime, all of these things we sell.
p371
aVSo the store actually did really well.
p372
aVBut it brought in so many people \u2014
p373
aVteachers, donors, volunteers, everybody \u2014
p374
aVbecause it was street level. It was open to the public.
p375
aVIt wasn't a non-profit buried, you know, on the 30th floor
p376
aVof some building downtown. It was right in the neighborhood
p377
aVthat it was serving, and it was open all the time to the public.
p378
aVSo, it became this sort of weird, happy accident.
p379
aa(lp380
VSo all the people I used to know in Brooklyn, they said,
p381
aV"Well, why don't we have a place like that here?"
p382
aVAnd a lot of them had been former educators
p383
aVor would-be educators, so they combined
p384
aVwith a lot of local designers, local writers,
p385
aVand they just took the idea independently
p386
aVand they did their own thing.
p387
aVThey didn't want to sell pirate supplies.
p388
aVThey didn't think that that was going to work there.
p389
aVSo, knowing the crime-fighting community in New York,
p390
aVthey opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company.
p391
aVThis is Sam Potts' great design that did this.
p392
aVAnd this was to make it look sort of like one of those
p393
aVkeysmith's shops that has to have every service
p394
aVthey've ever offered, you know, all over there.
p395
aVSo they opened this place. Inside, it's like a Costco
p396
aVfor superheroes \u2014 all the supplies in kind of basic form.
p397
aVThese are all handmade.
p398
aVThese are all sort of repurposed other products, or whatever.
p399
aVAll the packaging is done by Sam Potts.
p400
aa(lp401
VSo then you have the villain containment unit,
p402
aVwhere kids put their parents. You have the office.
p403
aVThis is a little vault \u2014 you have to put your product in there,
p404
aVit goes up an electric lift
p405
aVand then the guy behind the counter tells you
p406
aVthat you have to recite the vow of heroism,
p407
aVwhich you do, if you want to buy anything. And it limits, really, their sales.
p408
aVPersonally, I think it's a problem.
p409
aVBecause they have to do it hand on heart and everything.
p410
aVThese are some of the products. These are all handmade.
p411
aVThis is a secret identity kit.
p412
aVIf you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone,
p413
aVone American female marketing executive
p414
aVfrom Hoboken, New Jersey. It's a full dossier
p415
aVon everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone.
p416
aVSo, this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape,
p417
aVand then you walk up these three steel-graded steps
p418
aVand then we turn on three hydraulic fans
p419
aVfrom every side and then you can see the cape in action.
p420
aVThere's nothing worse than, you know,
p421
aVgetting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that.
p422
aVSo then, the secret door \u2014
p423
aVthis is one of the shelves you don't see
p424
aVwhen you walk in, but it slowly opens.
p425
aVYou can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks.
p426
aVIt opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back. (Applause)
p427
aVSo you can see the full effect!
p428
aa(lp429
VBut this is \u2014 I just want to emphasize \u2014
p430
aVlocally funded, locally built.
p431
aVAll the designers, all of the builders,
p432
aVeverybody was local, all the time was pro-bono.
p433
aVI just came and visited and said, "Yes, you guys are doing great,"
p434
aVor whatever. That was it. You can see the time
p435
aVin all five boroughs of New York in the back. (Laughter) (Applause)
p436
aVSo this is the space during tutoring hours.
p437
aVIt's very busy. Same principles: one-on-one attention,
p438
aVcomplete devotion to the students' work
p439
aVand a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility
p440
aVof creativity and ideas.
p441
aVAnd this switch is flicked in their heads
p442
aVwhen they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store, right?
p443
aVSo it's school, but it's not school.
p444
aVIt's clearly not school, even though
p445
aVthey're working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables, pencils and papers, whatever.
p446
aa(lp447
VThis is one of the students, Khaled Hamdan.
p448
aVYou can read this quote.
p449
aVAddicted to video games and TV. Couldn't concentrate at home.
p450
aVCame in. Got this concentrated attention.
p451
aVAnd he couldn't escape it.
p452
aVSo, soon enough, he was writing. He would finish his homework early \u2014
p453
aVgot really addicted to finishing his homework early.
p454
aVIt's an addictive thing to sort of be done with it,
p455
aVand to have it checked, and to know he's going to achieve
p456
aVthe next thing and be prepared for school the next day.
p457
aVSo he got hooked on that, and then he started doing other things.
p458
aVHe's now been published in five books.
p459
aVHe co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes
p460
aVcalled "Super-Has-Beens."
p461
aVHe wrote a series on "Penguin Balboa,"
p462
aVwhich is a fighting \u2014 a boxing \u2014 penguin.
p463
aVAnd then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space,
p464
aVat a benefit for 826 New York. So he's there every day.
p465
aVHe's evangelical about it. He brings his cousins in now.
p466
aVThere's four family members that come in every day.
p467
aa(lp468
VSo, I'll go through really quickly.
p469
aVThis is L.A., The Echo Park Time Travel Mart:
p470
aV"Whenever You Are, We're Already Then." (Laughter)
p471
aVThis is sort of a 7-Eleven for time travelers.
p472
aVSo you see everything: it's exactly as a 7-Eleven would be.
p473
aVLeeches. Mammoth chunks. They even have their own Slurpee machine:
p474
aV"Out of Order. Come Back Yesterday." (Laughter) (Applause)
p475
aa(lp476
VAnyway. So I'm going to jump ahead.
p477
aVThese are spaces that are only affiliated with us,
p478
aVdoing this same thing: Word St. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts;
p479
aVInk Spot in Cincinnati; Youth Speaks, San Francisco, California,
p480
aVwhich inspired us; Studio St. Louis in St. Louis;
p481
aVAustin Bat Cave in Austin;
p482
aVFighting Words in Dublin, Ireland, started by Roddy Doyle,
p483
aVthis will be open in April.
p484
aVNow I'm going to the TED Wish \u2014 is that okay?
p485
aa(lp486
VAll right, I've got a minute. So, the TED Wish:
p487
aVI wish that you \u2014 you personally and every creative individual
p488
aVand organization you know \u2014 will find a way
p489
aVto directly engage with a public school in your area
p490
aVand that you'll then tell the story of how you got involved,
p491
aVso that within a year we have a thousand examples \u2014
p492
aVa thousand! \u2014 of transformative partnerships.
p493
aVProfound leaps forward!
p494
aVAnd these can be things that maybe you're already doing.
p495
aVI know that so many people in this room
p496
aVare already doing really interesting things.
p497
aVI know that for a fact. So, tell us these stories and inspire others on the website.
p498
aa(lp499
VWe created a website.
p500
aVI'm going to switch to "we," and not "I," hope:
p501
aVWe hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in
p502
aVa new era of participation in our public schools.
p503
aVWe hope that you will take the lead
p504
aVin partnering your innovative spirit and expertise
p505
aVwith that of innovative educators in your community.
p506
aVAlways let the teachers lead the way.
p507
aVThey will tell you how to be useful. I hope that you'll step in and help out.
p508
aVThere are a million ways.
p509
aVYou can walk up to your local school
p510
aVand consult with the teachers. They'll always tell you how to help.
p511
aVSo, this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco,
p512
aVthey did this phenomenal job.
p513
aVThis website is already up, it's already got a bunch of stories,
p514
aVa lot of ideas. It's called "Once Upon a School,"
p515
aVwhich is a great title, I think.
p516
aVThis site will document every story, every project that comes
p517
aVout of this conference and around the world. So you go to the website,
p518
aVyou see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by
p519
aVand then you add your own projects once you get started.
p520
aVHot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline. So, visit the site.
p521
aVIf you have any questions, you can ask this guy,
p522
aVwho's our director of national programs. He'll be on the phone.
p523
aVYou email him, he'll answer any question you possibly want.
p524
aVAnd he'll get you inspired and get you going
p525
aVand guide you through the process so that you can affect change.
p526
aa(lp527
VAnd it can be fun! That's the point of this talk \u2014
p528
aVit needn't be sterile. It needn't be bureaucratically untenable.
p529
aVYou can do and use the skills that you have.
p530
aVThe schools need you. The teachers need you.
p531
aVStudents and parents need you. They need your actual person:
p532
aVyour physical personhood and your open minds
p533
aVand open ears and boundless compassion,
p534
aVsitting next to them, listening and nodding
p535
aVand asking questions for hours at a time.
p536
aVSome of these kids just don't plain know how good they are:
p537
aVhow smart and how much they have to say.
p538
aVYou can tell them. You can shine that light on them,
p539
aVone human interaction at a time. So we hope you'll join us.
p540
aVThank you so much.
