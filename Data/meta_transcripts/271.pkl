(lp3
VSo, I'm in Chile,
p4
aVin the Atacama desert, sitting in a hotel lobby,
p5
aVbecause that's the only place that I can get a Wi-Fi connection,
p6
aVand I have this picture up on my screen,
p7
aVand a woman comes up behind me.
p8
aVShe says, "Oh, that's beautiful.
p9
aVWhat is it? Is that Jackson Pollock?"
p10
aVAnd unfortunately, I can be a little too honest.
p11
aVI said, "No, it's \u2014 it's penguin shit."
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VAnd, you know, "Excuse me!"
p16
aVAnd I could sense
p17
aVthat she thought I was speaking synecdochically.
p18
aa(lp19
V(Laughter)
p20
aa(lp21
VSo, I said, "No, no, really \u2014 it's penguin shit."
p22
aa(lp23
V(Laughter)
p24
aa(lp25
VBecause I had just been in the Falkland Islands
p26
aVtaking pictures of penguins.
p27
aVThis is a Gentoo penguin. And she was still skeptical.
p28
aVSo, literally, a few minutes before that,
p29
aVI downloaded this scientific paper
p30
aVabout calculations on avian defecation,
p31
aVwhich is really quite interesting, because it turns out
p32
aVyou can model this as something called "Poiseuille flow,"
p33
aVand you can learn an awful lot
p34
aVabout the physics of the avian rectum.
p35
aVActually, technically, it's not a rectum. It's called a cloaca.
p36
aa(lp37
VAt this point, she stops me,
p38
aVand she says, "Who are you?
p39
aVWha \u2014 what do you do?"
p40
aVAnd I was stuck,
p41
aVbecause I didn't have any way to describe what I do.
p42
aVAnd so, in some sense,
p43
aVthis talk today
p44
aVis my answer to that.
p45
aVIt's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that I do.
p46
aVAnd it's very hard for me to make sense of it,
p47
aVso I'm not sure that you can.
p48
aVIt's the kind of thing that I sit up late at night thinking about sometimes \u2014
p49
aVoften at four in the morning.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo, some people are afraid of what I do.
p52
aVSome people think I am the nerd Tony Soprano,
p53
aVand in response, I have ordered
p54
aVa bulletproof pocket protector.
p55
aVI'm not sure what these people think,
p56
aVbecause I don't speak Norsk.
p57
aa(lp58
V(Laughter)
p59
aa(lp60
VBut I'm not thinking "monsteret" is a good thing.
p61
aVI don't know, you know?
p62
aVSo, one of the things that I love to do
p63
aVis travel around the world and look at archaeological sites.
p64
aVBecause archaeology gives us an opportunity
p65
aVto study past civilizations,
p66
aVand see where they succeeded
p67
aVand where they failed.
p68
aVUse science to, you know,
p69
aVwork backwards and say, "Well, really, what were they thinking?"
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd recently, I was in Easter Island,
p72
aVwhich is an incredibly beautiful place,
p73
aVand an incredibly mysterious place,
p74
aVbecause no matter where you go in Easter Island,
p75
aVyou're struck by these statues, called the moai.
p76
aVThe place is 64 square miles.
p77
aVThey made, so far as we can tell, 900 of them.
p78
aVWhy on Earth? And if you haven't read
p79
aVJared Diamond's book, "Collapse,"
p80
aVI totally recommend that you do.
p81
aVHe's got a great chapter about it.
p82
aVBasically, these people
p83
aVcommitted ecological suicide
p84
aVin order to make more of these.
p85
aVAnd somewhere along the line, somebody said,
p86
aV"I know! Let's cut down the last tree
p87
aVand commit suicide, because
p88
aVwe need more identical statues."
p89
aa(lp90
V(Laughter)
p91
aa(lp92
VAnd,
p93
aVone thing that isn't a mystery, actually,
p94
aVwas when I grew up \u2014 because when I was a little kid, I'd seen these pictures \u2014
p95
aVand I thought, "Well, why that look on the face?
p96
aVWhy that brow?" I mean, it's such a powerful thing.
p97
aVWhere did they get that inspiration?
p98
aVAnd then I met Yoyo,
p99
aVwho is the native Rapa Nui-an guide,
p100
aVand if you look at Yoyo's face,
p101
aVyou kind of figure out where they got it.
p102
aa(lp103
VThere's many mysteries, these statues.
p104
aVEveryone wants to know, how did they make them,
p105
aVhow did they transport them?
p106
aVThis woman in the foreground is Jo Anne Van Tilberg.
p107
aVShe's the leading archaeologist working Easter Island today.
p108
aVAnd she has studied the statues for 20-some years,
p109
aVand she has detailed records of every single statue.
p110
aVThe one on the page here is the same that's up there.
p111
aVOne interesting problem is the stone isn't very hard.
p112
aVSo, this used to be completely smooth.
p113
aVIn fact, in many of the statues, when you excavate them,
p114
aVthe backs are totally smooth \u2014 almost glass smooth.
p115
aVBut after 1,000 years out in the weather,
p116
aVthey look like this.
p117
aa(lp118
VJo Anne and I have just embarked on a project to digitize them all,
p119
aVand we're going to do a very high-res digitization,
p120
aVfirst because it's a way of preserving them.
p121
aVSecond, we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically, then,
p122
aVlearn a few of the mysteries about them.
p123
aVHow long have they been standing in what positions?
p124
aVAnd maybe, indirectly, get at some of the issues of
p125
aVwhat caused them to be the way they are.
p126
aVWhile I was in Easter Island, comet McNaught was there also,
p127
aVso you get a gratuitous picture
p128
aVof a moai with a comet.
p129
aa(lp130
VI also have an archaeological project going on
p131
aVin Egypt.
p132
aV"Going on" is perhaps a little bit strong.
p133
aVWe're trying to get all of the permissions
p134
aVto get everything all set, to get it going.
p135
aVSo, I'll talk about it at a future TED.
p136
aVBut there's some amazing opportunities in Egypt as well.
p137
aVAnother thing I do is I invent stuff.
p138
aVIn fact, I design nuclear reactors.
p139
aVNot a joke.
p140
aVThis is the conventional
p141
aVnuclear fuel cycle.
p142
aVThe red line is what is done in
p143
aVmost nuclear reactors. It's called the open fuel cycle.
p144
aVThe white lines are what's called an advance fuel cycle,
p145
aVwhere you reprocess.
p146
aa(lp147
VNow, this is the normal way it's done.
p148
aVIt's got the huge advantage that it
p149
aVdoes not create carbon pollution.
p150
aVIt has a lot of disadvantages:
p151
aVeach one of these steps is extremely expensive,
p152
aVit's potentially dangerous
p153
aVand they have the interesting property that the step
p154
aVcannot be performed in anyone's backyard,
p155
aVwhich is a problem.
p156
aVSo, our reactor eliminates these steps,
p157
aVwhich, if we can actually make it work, is a really cool thing.
p158
aVNow, it's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor.
p159
aVThere's \u2014 no reactor's been even built
p160
aVto an old design, much less a new one, in the United States
p161
aVfor 25 years.
p162
aVIt's the kind of very high-risk, but potentially very high-return
p163
aVthing that we do.
p164
aa(lp165
VChanging into a totally different field,
p166
aVwe do a lot of stuff in solid state physics,
p167
aVparticularly in an area called metamaterials.
p168
aVA metamaterial is an artificial material,
p169
aVwhich manipulates, in this case, electromagnetic radiation,
p170
aVin a way that you couldn't otherwise.
p171
aVSo, this device here is an invisibility cloak.
p172
aVIt may not seem that, but if you were a microwave,
p173
aVthis is how you would view it.
p174
aVRays of light \u2014 in this case, microwave light \u2014
p175
aVcome in, and they just squish around the cell,
p176
aVand they come back the other side.
p177
aVNow, you could do that with mirrors from one angle.
p178
aVThe cool thing is, this does it from all angles.
p179
aVMetamaterials, unfortunately \u2014
p180
aVA, it only works on microwave,
p181
aVand B, it doesn't work all that well yet.
p182
aVBut metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field.
p183
aVIt's \u2014 you know, today I'd like to say
p184
aVit's a zero billion dollar business, but,
p185
aVin fact, it's negative.
p186
aVBut some day, some day, maybe it's going to work.
p187
aa(lp188
VWe do a lot of work in biomedical fields.
p189
aVIn this case, we're working with a major medical foundation
p190
aVto develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing
p191
aVdiseases in developing countries.
p192
aVSo, they say the eyes are the windows of the soul \u2014
p193
aVturns out they're a window to a whole lot more stuff.
p194
aVAnd these happen to be my eyes, by the way.
p195
aa(lp196
VNow, I'm also very interested in cooking.
p197
aVWhile I was at Microsoft, I took a leave of absence
p198
aVand went to a chef school in France.
p199
aVI used to work, also while at Microsoft,
p200
aVat a leading restaurant in Seattle,
p201
aVso I do a lot of cooking.
p202
aVI've been on a team that won
p203
aVthe world championship of barbecue.
p204
aVBut barbecue's interesting, because it's one of these cult foods
p205
aVlike chili, or bouillabaisse.
p206
aVVarious parts of the world will have a cult food
p207
aVthat people get enormously attached to \u2014
p208
aVthere's tremendous traditions, there's secrecy.
p209
aVAnd I'm trying to use a very
p210
aVscientific approach.
p211
aVSo, this is my latest cooker,
p212
aVand if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor,
p213
aVthat's because it is.
p214
aVBut if you get to play with all those knobs and dials \u2014
p215
aVand of course, really the controller over there does it all on software \u2014
p216
aVyou can make some terrific ribs.
p217
aa(lp218
V(Laughter)
p219
aa(lp220
VThis is a high-speed centrifuge.
p221
aVYou should all have one in your kitchen,
p222
aVbeside your Turbochef.
p223
aVThis subjects food to a force about 50,000 times
p224
aVthat of normal gravity,
p225
aVand oh boy, does it clarify chicken stock.
p226
aVYou would not believe it!
p227
aVI perform a series of ghoulish experiments
p228
aVon food \u2014
p229
aVin this case, trying to calibrate a mathematical model
p230
aVso that one can predict exactly
p231
aVwhat the internal cooking times are.
p232
aVIt turns out, A, it's useful, and for a geek like me, it's fun.
p233
aVTheory is red,
p234
aVblack is experiment.
p235
aVSo, I'm either really good at faking it,
p236
aVor this particular model seems to work.
p237
aa(lp238
VSo, another random thing I do
p239
aVis the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,
p240
aVor SETI.
p241
aVAnd you may be familiar with the movie "Contact,"
p242
aVwhich sort of popularized that.
p243
aVIt turns out there are real people who go out
p244
aVand search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way.
p245
aVIn fact, almost everybody in the movie
p246
aVis based on a real character, a real person.
p247
aVSo, the Jodie Foster character here
p248
aVis actually this woman, Jill Tarter,
p249
aVand Jill has dedicated her life to this.
p250
aVYou know, a lot of people risk their lives
p251
aVin a brief act of heroism,
p252
aVwhich is kind of cool,
p253
aVbut Jill has
p254
aVwhat I call slow heroism.
p255
aVShe is risking her professional life on something
p256
aVthat her own calculations show
p257
aVmay not work for a thousand years \u2014 may not ever.
p258
aVSo, I like to support people that are risking their lives.
p259
aa(lp260
VAfter the movie came out, of course, there was a lot of interest in SETI.
p261
aVMy kids saw the movie,
p262
aVand afterwards they came to me and they said,
p263
aV"So, Dad, so \u2014 so \u2014
p264
aVthat character \u2014 that's Jill, right?"
p265
aVI said, "Oh, yeah, yeah \u2014 absolutely."
p266
aV"And that other person, that's someone \u2014 " I said, "Yes."
p267
aVThey said, "Well, you know that creepy rich guy in the movie?
p268
aVIs that you?"
p269
aVI said, "Well, you know, it's just a movie! Come on."
p270
aa(lp271
V(Laughter)
p272
aa(lp273
VSo, the SETI Institute,
p274
aVwith a little bit of help from me, and a lot of help from Paul Allen
p275
aVand a variety of other people,
p276
aVis building a dedicated radio telescope
p277
aVin Hat Creek, California,
p278
aVso they can do this SETI work.
p279
aVNow, I travel a lot, and I change cell phones a lot,
p280
aVand the one person who always gets updated
p281
aVon all my cell phones and pagers and everything else
p282
aVis Jill, because I really don't want to miss
p283
aV"the call."
p284
aa(lp285
V(Laughter)
p286
aa(lp287
VI mean, can you imagine? E.T.'s phoning home,
p288
aVand I'm not, like, there? You know, horrible!
p289
aVSo, I do a lot of work on dinosaurs.
p290
aVI'm known to TEDsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs.
p291
aVAnd I resemble that remark.
p292
aVI'm going to talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs,
p293
aVwhich is the finding of them.
p294
aVNow, to find dinosaurs, you hike around in horrible conditions
p295
aVlooking for a dinosaur.
p296
aVIt sounds really dumb, but that's what it is.
p297
aVIt's horrible conditions, because
p298
aVwherever you have nice weather,
p299
aVplants grow,
p300
aVand you don't get any erosion, and you don't see any dinosaurs.
p301
aVSo, you always find dinosaurs
p302
aVin deserts or badlands,
p303
aVareas that have very little plant growth
p304
aVand have flash floods in the spring.
p305
aVYou know, skiers pray for snow?
p306
aVPaleontologists pray for erosion.
p307
aa(lp308
VSo, you hike around
p309
aVand \u2014 this is after you dig them up, they look like this.
p310
aVYou hike around, you see something like this.
p311
aVNow, this is something I found, so look at it very closely here.
p312
aVYou've got this bentonite clay,
p313
aVwhich is \u2014 sort of swells up and expands.
p314
aVAnd there's some stuff poking out. So, you look at that,
p315
aVand you look up close, and you say,
p316
aV"Well, gee, that's kind of interesting. What are all of these pieces?"
p317
aVWell, if you look closely, you can recognize, actually,
p318
aVfrom the shape, that these are skull fragments.
p319
aVAnd then when you look at this,
p320
aVyou say, "That's a tooth.
p321
aVIt's a big tooth."
p322
aVIt's about the size of a banana.
p323
aVIt has a big serration on the edge.
p324
aVThis is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground.
p325
aVAnd this is what it's like to find a Tyrannosaurus rex,
p326
aVwhich I was lucky enough to do a few years ago.
p327
aa(lp328
VNow, this is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room.
p329
aVNot the same one, actually. This is a cast, which I had bought,
p330
aVand then, after buying the cast, I found my own,
p331
aVand I don't have room for two.
p332
aVYou know.
p333
aVSo, the thing that's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs
p334
aVis that it is both an intellectual thing,
p335
aVbecause you're trying to reconstruct the environment
p336
aVof millions of years ago.
p337
aVIt's something that can inform all sorts of science
p338
aVin unexpected ways.
p339
aVThe study of dinosaurs led to the realization
p340
aVthat there's a problem with asteroid impact,
p341
aVfor example.
p342
aVThe study of dinosaurs may, literally,
p343
aVone day save the planet.
p344
aa(lp345
VStudy of the ancient climate is very important.
p346
aVIn fact, the Mesozoic, when dinosaurs lived,
p347
aVhad much higher CO2 than today,
p348
aVwas much warmer than today, and is one of the interesting proof points
p349
aVfor the effects of CO2 on climate.
p350
aVBut, besides being intellectually
p351
aVand scientifically interesting, it's also very different
p352
aVthan the other things I do, because you get to hike around in the badlands.
p353
aVThis is actually what most dinosaur research looks like.
p354
aVThis is one of my papers: "A pygostyle from a non-avian theropod."
p355
aVIt's not as gripping as dinosaur sex,
p356
aVso we're not going to go into it further.
p357
aa(lp358
VNow, I'm also really big on photography.
p359
aVI travel all over the world taking pictures \u2014
p360
aVsome of them good, most of them not.
p361
aVThese days, bits are cheap. Unfortunately, that means
p362
aVyou've got to spend more time sorting through them.
p363
aVHere's a picture I took in the Falkland Islands
p364
aVof king penguins on a beach.
p365
aVHere's a picture I took in Alaska, a few years ago, of Orcas.
p366
aVI'd gone up to photograph Orcas,
p367
aVand we had looked for a week,
p368
aVand we hadn't seen a damn Orca.
p369
aVAnd the last day, the sun comes out,
p370
aVthe Orcas come, they're right by the boat. It's fantastic.
p371
aVAnd I get lots of pictures like this.
p372
aVThen, a little bit later,
p373
aVI start getting some pictures like this.
p374
aVNow, to a human audience, I need to explain that
p375
aVif Penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition,
p376
aVthis would be the centerfold.
p377
aVIt's true.
p378
aVSo, there's more and more activity near the boat,
p379
aVand all of a sudden somebody shouts,
p380
aV"What's that in the water?"
p381
aVI said, "Well, I think that's what you call a free willy."
p382
aa(lp383
V(Laughter)
p384
aa(lp385
VThere's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex.
p386
aa(lp387
V(Laughter)
p388
aVThe first thing you learn
p389
aVis the overwhelming importance of hands.
p390
aVThey don't have them.
p391
aa(lp392
V(Laughter)
p393
aa(lp394
VI think Paul Simon is in the audience,
p395
aVand he has \u2014
p396
aVhe may not realize it, but he wrote a song all about whale sex,
p397
aV"Slip-Slidin' Away."
p398
aVThat's kind of what it's like.
p399
aVThe other interesting thing that I learned about whale sex:
p400
aVthey curl their toes too.
p401
aa(lp402
V(Laughter)
p403
aa(lp404
VSo \u2014
p405
aVwhere do you go putting all of these disparate pieces together?
p406
aVYou know, there's a tremendous amount of wisdom
p407
aVin finding a great thing, passion in life,
p408
aVand focusing all your energy on it,
p409
aVand I've never been able to do that.
p410
aVI just \u2014 you know, because, yes,
p411
aVI'll focus passion on something,
p412
aVbut then there will be something else, and then there's something else again.
p413
aVAnd for a long time I fought this, and I thought,
p414
aV"Well, gee, I really ought to buckle down."
p415
aVAnd you know, when I was at Microsoft,
p416
aVthat was so engrossing,
p417
aVand the whole industry was expanding so much,
p418
aVthat it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life.
p419
aa(lp420
VBut ultimately,
p421
aVI decided
p422
aVthat what I really ought to do is not fight being who I am,
p423
aVbut embrace it.
p424
aVAnd say, "Yeah, you know, I \u2014
p425
aVthis whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep,
p426
aVbut that's really what works for me."
p427
aVAnd regardless of whether it's nuclear reactors
p428
aVor metamaterials or whale sex,
p429
aVthe common \u2014 or lowest common denominator \u2014 is me.
p430
aVThat's it, thank you.
