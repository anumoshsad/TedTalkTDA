VAfrica is booming.
p4
aVPer capita incomes since the year 2000
p5
aVhave doubled,
p6
aVand this boom is impacting on everyone.
p7
aVLife expectancy has increased by one year
p8
aVevery three years for the last decade.
p9
aVThat means if an African child is born today,
p10
aVrather than three days ago,
p11
aVthey will get an extra day of life
p12
aVat the end of their lifespan.
p13
aVIt's that quick.
p14
aVAnd HIV infection rates are down 27 percent:
p15
aV600,000 less people a year are getting HIV
p16
aVin sub-Saharan Africa.
p17
aVThe battle against malaria is being won,
p18
aVwith deaths from malaria down 27 percent,
p19
aVaccording to the latest World Bank data.
p20
aVAnd malaria nets actually are playing a role in that.
p21
aVThis shouldn't surprise us,
p22
aVbecause actually, everybody grows.
p23
aVIf you go back to Imperial Rome
p24
aVin the Year 1 A.D.,
p25
aVthere was admittedly about 1,800 years
p26
aVwhere there wasn't an awful lot of growth.
p27
aVBut then the people that the Romans
p28
aVwould have called Scottish barbarians, my ancestors,
p29
aVwere actually part of the Industrial Revolution,
p30
aVand in the 19th century, growth began to accelerate,
p31
aVand you saw that get quicker and quicker,
p32
aVand it's been impacting everyone.
p33
aVIt doesn't matter if this is the jungles of Singapore
p34
aVor the tundra of northern Finland.
p35
aVEverybody gets involved. It's just a matter of when
p36
aVthe inevitable happens.
p37
aa(lp38
VAmong the reasons I think it's happening right now
p39
aVis the quality of the leadership across Africa.
p40
aVI think most of us would agree that in the 1990s,
p41
aVthe greatest politician in the world was African,
p42
aVbut I'm meeting brilliant people
p43
aVacross the continent the entire time,
p44
aVand they're doing the reforms
p45
aVwhich have transformed the economic situation
p46
aVfor their countries.
p47
aa(lp48
VAnd the West is engaging with that.
p49
aVThe West has given debt forgiveness programs
p50
aVwhich have halved sub-Saharan debt
p51
aVfrom about 70 percent of GDP down to about 40.
p52
aVAt the same time, our debt level's gone up to 120
p53
aVand we're all feeling slightly miserable
p54
aVas a result.
p55
aVPolitics gets weaker when debt is high.
p56
aVWhen public sector debt is low,
p57
aVgovernments don't have to choose
p58
aVbetween investing in education and health
p59
aVand paying interest on that debt you owe.
p60
aVAnd it's not just the public sector which is looking so good.
p61
aVThe private sector as well.
p62
aVAgain, in the West, we have private sector debt
p63
aVof 200 percent of GDP in Spain,
p64
aVthe U.K., and the U.S.
p65
aVThat's an awful lot of debt.
p66
aVAfrica, many African countries,
p67
aVare sitting at 10 to 30 percent of GDP.
p68
aVIf there's any continent that can do what China has done \u2014
p69
aVChina's at about 130 percent of GDP on that chart \u2014
p70
aVif anyone can do what China has done
p71
aVin the last 30 years,
p72
aVit'll be Africa in the next 30.
p73
aa(lp74
VSo they've got great government finances, great private sector debt.
p75
aVDoes anyone recognize this? In fact, they do.
p76
aVForeign direct investment
p77
aVhas poured into Africa in the last 15 years.
p78
aVBack in the '70s,
p79
aVno one touched the continent with a barge pole.
p80
aVAnd this investment is actually Western-led.
p81
aVWe hear a lot about China,
p82
aVand they do lend a lot of money,
p83
aVbut 60 percent of the FDI in the last couple of years
p84
aVhas come from Europe, America, Australia, Canada.
p85
aVTen percent's come from India.
p86
aVAnd they're investing in energy.
p87
aVAfrica produces 10 million barrels a day of oil now.
p88
aVIt's the same as Saudi Arabia or Russia.
p89
aVAnd they're investing in telecoms,
p90
aVshopping malls.
p91
aVAnd this very encouraging story, I think,
p92
aVis partly demographic-led.
p93
aVAnd it's not just about African demographics.
p94
aVI'm showing you the number of 15- to 24-year-olds
p95
aVin various parts of the world,
p96
aVand the blue line is the one I want you to focus on for a second.
p97
aVTen years ago, say you're Foxconn
p98
aVsetting up an iPhone factory, by chance.
p99
aVYou might choose China,
p100
aVwhich is the bulk of that East Asian blue line,
p101
aVwhere there's 200 million young people,
p102
aVand every year until 2010 that's getting bigger.
p103
aVWhich means you're going to have new guys
p104
aVknocking on the door saying, "Give us a job,"
p105
aVand, "I don't need a big pay rise, just please give me a job."
p106
aVNow, that's completely changed now.
p107
aVThis decade, we're going to see a 20- to 30-percent
p108
aVfall in the number of 15- to 24-year-olds in China.
p109
aVSo where do you set up your new factory?
p110
aVYou look at South Asia, and people are.
p111
aVThey're looking at Pakistan and Bangladesh,
p112
aVand they're also looking at Africa.
p113
aVAnd they're looking at Africa
p114
aVbecause that yellow line is showing you
p115
aVthat the number of young Africans
p116
aVis going to continue to get bigger
p117
aVdecade after decade after decade out to 2050.
p118
aa(lp119
VNow, there's a problem with lots of young people
p120
aVcoming into any market,
p121
aVparticularly when they're young men.
p122
aVA bit dangerous, sometimes.
p123
aVI think one of the crucial factors
p124
aVis how educated is that demographic?
p125
aVIf you look at the red line here,
p126
aVwhat you're going to see is that in 1975,
p127
aVjust nine percent of kids
p128
aVwere in secondary school education
p129
aVin sub-Saharan Africa.
p130
aVWould you set up a factory
p131
aVin sub-Sahara in the mid-1970s?
p132
aVNobody else did.
p133
aVThey chose instead Turkey and Mexico
p134
aVto set up the textiles factories,
p135
aVbecause their education levels
p136
aVwere 25 to 30 percent.
p137
aVToday, sub-Sahara is at the levels
p138
aVthat Turkey and Mexico were at in 1975.
p139
aVThey will get the textiles jobs
p140
aVthat will take people out of rural poverty
p141
aVand put them on the road to industrialization and wealth.
p142
aa(lp143
VSo what's Africa looking like today?
p144
aVThis is how I look at Africa.
p145
aVIt's a bit odd, because I'm an economist.
p146
aVEach little box is about a billion dollars,
p147
aVand you see that I pay an awful lot of attention
p148
aVto Nigeria sitting there in the middle.
p149
aVSouth Africa is playing a role.
p150
aVBut when I'm thinking about the future,
p151
aVI'm actually most interested
p152
aVin Central, Western and Southern Africa.
p153
aVIf I look at Africa by population,
p154
aVEast Africa stands out
p155
aVas so much potential.
p156
aa(lp157
VAnd I'm showing you something else with these maps.
p158
aVI'm showing you democracy versus autocracy.
p159
aVFragile democracies is the beige color.
p160
aVStrong democracies are the orange color.
p161
aVAnd what you'll see here is that most Africans
p162
aVare now living in democracies.
p163
aVWhy does that matter?
p164
aVBecause what people want
p165
aVis what politicians try,
p166
aVthey don't always succeed, but they try and deliver.
p167
aVAnd what you've got is a reinforcing positive circle going on.
p168
aVIn Ghana in the elections, in December 2012,
p169
aVthe battle between the two candidates
p170
aVwas over education.
p171
aVOne guy offered free secondary school education
p172
aVto all, not just 30 percent.
p173
aVThe other guy had to say,
p174
aVI'm going to build 50 new schools.
p175
aVHe won by a margin.
p176
aVSo democracy is encouraging governments
p177
aVto invest in education.
p178
aVEducation is helping growth and investment,
p179
aVand that's giving budget revenues,
p180
aVwhich is giving governments more money,
p181
aVwhich is helping growth through education.
p182
aVIt's a positive, virtuous circle.
p183
aa(lp184
VBut I get asked this question,
p185
aVand this particular question makes me quite sad:
p186
aVIt's, "But what about corruption?
p187
aVHow can you invest in Africa when there's corruption?"
p188
aVAnd what makes me sad about it
p189
aVis that this graph here is showing you
p190
aVthat the biggest correlation with corruption is wealth.
p191
aVWhen you're poor, corruption is not your biggest priority.
p192
aVAnd the countries on the right hand side,
p193
aVyou'll see the per capita GDP,
p194
aVbasically every country
p195
aVwith a per capita GDP of, say, less than 5,000 dollars,
p196
aVhas got a corruption score
p197
aVof roughly, what's that, about three?
p198
aVThree out of 10. That's not good.
p199
aVEvery poor country is corrupt.
p200
aVEvery rich country is relatively uncorrupt.
p201
aVHow do you get from poverty and corruption
p202
aVto wealth and less corruption?
p203
aVYou see the middle class grow.
p204
aVAnd the way to do that is to invest,
p205
aVnot to say I'm not investing in that continent
p206
aVbecause there's too much corruption.
p207
aa(lp208
VNow, I don't want to be an apologist for corruption.
p209
aVI've been arrested because I refused to pay a bribe \u2014
p210
aVnot in Africa, actually.
p211
aVBut what I'm saying here is that
p212
aVwe can make a difference
p213
aVand we can do that by investing.
p214
aa(lp215
VNow I'm going to let you in on a little not-so-secret.
p216
aVEconomists aren't great at forecasting.
p217
aVBecause the question really is, what happens next?
p218
aVAnd if you go back to the year 2000,
p219
aVwhat you'll find is The Economist
p220
aVhad a very famous cover, "The Hopeless Continent,"
p221
aVand what they'd done is they'd looked at growth
p222
aVin Africa over the previous 10 years \u2014 two percent \u2014
p223
aVand they said,
p224
aVwhat's going to happen in the next 10 years?
p225
aVThey assumed two percent,
p226
aVand that made it a pretty hopeless story,
p227
aVbecause population growth was two and a half.
p228
aVPeople got poorer in Africa in the 1990s.
p229
aVNow 2012, The Economist has a new cover,
p230
aVand what does that new cover show?
p231
aVThat new cover shows, well, Africa rising,
p232
aVbecause the growth over the last 10 years
p233
aVhas been about five and a half percent.
p234
aa(lp235
VI would like to see if you can all now become economists,
p236
aVbecause if growth for the last 10 years
p237
aVhas been five and a half percent,
p238
aVwhat do you think the IMF is forecasting
p239
aVfor the next five years of growth in Africa?
p240
aVVery good. I think you're secretly saying
p241
aVto your head, probably five and a half percent.
p242
aVYou're all economists, and I think,
p243
aVlike most economists, wrong.
p244
aVNo offense.
p245
aa(lp246
VWhat I like to do is try and find the countries
p247
aVthat are doing exactly what Africa has already done,
p248
aVand it means that jump from 1,800 years of nothing
p249
aVto whoof, suddenly shooting through the roof.
p250
aVIndia is one of those examples.
p251
aVThis is Indian growth from 1960 to 2010.
p252
aVIgnore the scale on the bottom for a second.
p253
aVActually, for the first 20 years,
p254
aVthe '60s and '70s, India didn't really grow.
p255
aVIt grew at two percent
p256
aVwhen population growth was about two and a half.
p257
aVIf that's familiar, that's exactly what happened
p258
aVin sub-Sahara in the '80s and the '90s.
p259
aVAnd then something happened in 1980.
p260
aVBoom! India began to explode.
p261
aVIt wasn't a "Hindu rate of growth,"
p262
aV"democracies can't grow." Actually India could.
p263
aVAnd if I lay sub-Saharan growth
p264
aVon top of the Indian growth story,
p265
aVit's remarkably similar.
p266
aVTwenty years of not much growth
p267
aVand a trend line which is actually telling you
p268
aVthat sub-Saharan African growth is
p269
aVslightly better than India.
p270
aVAnd if I then lay developing Asia on top of this,
p271
aVI'm saying India is 20 years ahead of Africa,
p272
aVI'm saying developing Asia is 10 years ahead of India,
p273
aVI can draw out some forecasts
p274
aVfor the next 30 to 40 years
p275
aVwhich I think are better
p276
aVthan the ones where you're looking backwards.
p277
aVAnd that tells me this:
p278
aVthat Africa is going to go
p279
aVfrom a $2 trillion economy today
p280
aVto a $29 trillion economy by 2050.
p281
aVNow that's bigger than Europe and America
p282
aVput together in today's money.
p283
aVLife expectancy is going to go up by 13 years.
p284
aVThe population's going to double
p285
aVfrom one billion to two billion,
p286
aVso household incomes are going to go up sevenfold
p287
aVin the next 35 years.
p288
aVAnd when I present this in Africa \u2014
p289
aVNairobi, Lagos, Accra \u2014 I get one question.
p290
aV"Charlie, why are you so pessimistic?"
p291
aa(lp292
VAnd you know what?
p293
aVActually, I think they've got a point.
p294
aVAm I really saying that there can be nothing learned,
p295
aVyes from the positives in Asia and India,
p296
aVbut also the negatives?
p297
aVPerhaps Africa can avoid some of the mistakes that have been made.
p298
aVSurely, the technologies that we're talking about here
p299
aVthis last week,
p300
aVsurely some of these can perhaps
p301
aVhelp Africa grow even faster?
p302
aVAnd I think here we can play a role.
p303
aVBecause technology does let you help.
p304
aVYou can go and download
p305
aVsome of the great African literature
p306
aVfrom the Internet now.
p307
aVNo, not right now, just 30 seconds.
p308
aVYou can go and buy some of the great tunes.
p309
aVMy iPod's full of them.
p310
aVBuy African products.
p311
aVGo on holiday and see for yourself
p312
aVthe change that's happening.
p313
aVInvest.
p314
aVPerhaps hire people, give them the skills
p315
aVthat they can take back to Africa,
p316
aVand their companies will grow an awful lot faster
p317
aVthan most of ours here in the West.
p318
aVAnd then you and I can help make sure
p319
aVthat for Africa, the 21st century is their century.
p320
