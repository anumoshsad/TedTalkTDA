VLast year, I went on my first book tour.
p4
aVIn 13 months, I flew to 14 countries
p5
aVand gave some hundred talks.
p6
aVEvery talk in every country
p7
aVbegan with an introduction,
p8
aVand every introduction began, alas, with a lie:
p9
aV"Taiye Selasi comes from Ghana and Nigeria,"
p10
aVor "Taiye Selasi comes from England and the States."
p11
aVWhenever I heard this opening sentence,
p12
aVno matter the country that concluded it \u2014
p13
aVEngland, America, Ghana, Nigeria \u2014
p14
aVI thought, "But that's not true."
p15
aVYes, I was born in England and grew up in the United States.
p16
aVMy mum, born in England, and raised in Nigeria,
p17
aVcurrently lives in Ghana.
p18
aVMy father was born in Gold Coast, a British colony,
p19
aVraised in Ghana,
p20
aVand has lived for over 30 years in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
p21
aVFor this reason, my introducers also called me "multinational."
p22
aV"But Nike is multinational," I thought,
p23
aV"I'm a human being."
p24
aa(lp25
VThen, one fine day, mid-tour,
p26
aVI went to Louisiana, a museum in Denmark
p27
aVwhere I shared the stage with the writer Colum McCann.
p28
aVWe were discussing the role of locality in writing,
p29
aVwhen suddenly it hit me.
p30
aVI'm not multinational.
p31
aVI'm not a national at all.
p32
aVHow could I come from a nation?
p33
aVHow can a human being come from a concept?
p34
aVIt's a question that had been bothering me for going on two decades.
p35
aVFrom newspapers, textbooks, conversations,
p36
aVI had learned to speak of countries
p37
aVas if they were eternal, singular, naturally occurring things,
p38
aVbut I wondered:
p39
aVto say that I came from a country
p40
aVsuggested that the country was an absolute,
p41
aVsome fixed point in place in time,
p42
aVa constant thing, but was it?
p43
aVIn my lifetime, countries had disappeared \u2014 Czechoslovakia;
p44
aVappeared \u2014 Timor-Leste; failed \u2014 Somalia.
p45
aVMy parents came from countries that didn't exist when they were born.
p46
aVTo me, a country \u2014 this thing that could be born, die, expand, contract \u2014
p47
aVhardly seemed the basis for understanding a human being.
p48
aa(lp49
VAnd so it came as a huge relief to discover the sovereign state.
p50
aVWhat we call countries are actually
p51
aVvarious expressions of sovereign statehood,
p52
aVan idea that came into fashion only 400 years ago.
p53
aVWhen I learned this, beginning my masters degree in international relations,
p54
aVI felt a sort of surge of relief.
p55
aVIt was as I had suspected.
p56
aVHistory was real, cultures were real,
p57
aVbut countries were invented.
p58
aVFor the next 10 years, I sought to re- or un-define myself,
p59
aVmy world, my work, my experience,
p60
aVbeyond the logic of the state.
p61
aa(lp62
VIn 2005, I wrote an essay, "What is an Afropolitan,"
p63
aVsketching out an identity that privileged culture over country.
p64
aVIt was thrilling how many people could relate to my experience,
p65
aVand instructional how many others didn't buy my sense of self.
p66
aV"How can Selasi claim to come from Ghana," one such critic asked,
p67
aV"when she's never known the indignities
p68
aVof traveling abroad on a Ghanian passport?"
p69
aa(lp70
VNow, if I'm honest,
p71
aVI knew just what she meant.
p72
aVI've got a friend named Layla who was born and raised in Ghana.
p73
aVHer parents are third-generation Ghanians of Lebanese descent.
p74
aVLayla, who speaks fluent Twi, knows Accra like the back of her hand,
p75
aVbut when we first met years ago, I thought, "She's not from Ghana."
p76
aVIn my mind, she came from Lebanon,
p77
aVdespite the patent fact that all her formative experience
p78
aVtook place in suburban Accra.
p79
aVI, like my critics,
p80
aVwas imagining some Ghana where all Ghanaians had brown skin
p81
aVor none held U.K. passports.
p82
aVI'd fallen into the limiting trap
p83
aVthat the language of coming from countries sets \u2014
p84
aVthe privileging of a fiction, the singular country,
p85
aVover reality: human experience.
p86
aVSpeaking with Colum McCann that day, the penny finally dropped.
p87
aV"All experience is local," he said.
p88
aV"All identity is experience," I thought.
p89
aV"I'm not a national," I proclaimed onstage.
p90
aV"I'm a local. I'm multi-local."
p91
aa(lp92
VSee, "Taiye Selasi comes from the United States," isn't the truth.
p93
aVI have no relationship with the United States,
p94
aVall 50 of them, not really.
p95
aVMy relationship is with Brookline, the town where I grew up;
p96
aVwith New York City, where I started work;
p97
aVwith Lawrenceville, where I spend Thanksgiving.
p98
aVWhat makes America home for me is not my passport or accent,
p99
aVbut these very particular experiences
p100
aVand the places they occur.
p101
aVDespite my pride in Ewe culture,
p102
aVthe Black Stars, and my love of Ghanaian food,
p103
aVI've never had a relationship with the Republic of Ghana, writ large.
p104
aVMy relationship is with Accra, where my mother lives,
p105
aVwhere I go each year,
p106
aVwith the little garden in Dzorwulu where my father and I talk for hours.
p107
aVThese are the places that shape my experience.
p108
aVMy experience is where I'm from.
p109
aa(lp110
VWhat if we asked, instead of "Where are you from?" \u2014
p111
aV"Where are you a local?"
p112
aVThis would tell us so much more about who and how similar we are.
p113
aVTell me you're from France, and I see what, a set of clichés?
p114
aVAdichie's dangerous single story, the myth of the nation of France?
p115
aVTell me you're a local of Fez and Paris,
p116
aVbetter yet, Goutte d'Or, and I see a set of experiences.
p117
aVOur experience is where we're from.
p118
aa(lp119
VSo, where are you a local?
p120
aVI propose a three-step test.
p121
aVI call these the three "R\u2019s": rituals, relationships, restrictions.
p122
aa(lp123
VFirst, think of your daily rituals, whatever they may be:
p124
aVmaking your coffee, driving to work,
p125
aVharvesting your crops, saying your prayers.
p126
aVWhat kind of rituals are these?
p127
aVWhere do they occur?
p128
aVIn what city or cities in the world do shopkeepers know your face?
p129
aVAs a child, I carried out fairly standard suburban rituals in Boston,
p130
aVwith adjustments made for the rituals my mother brought from London and Lagos.
p131
aVWe took off our shoes in the house,
p132
aVwe were unfailingly polite with our elders,
p133
aVwe ate slow-cooked, spicy food.
p134
aVIn snowy North America, ours were rituals of the global South.
p135
aVThe first time I went to Delhi or to southern parts of Italy,
p136
aVI was shocked by how at home I felt.
p137
aVThe rituals were familiar.
p138
aV"R" number one, rituals.
p139
aa(lp140
VNow, think of your relationships, of the people who shape your days.
p141
aVTo whom do you speak at least once a week,
p142
aVbe it face to face or on FaceTime?
p143
aVBe reasonable in your assessment;
p144
aVI'm not talking about your Facebook friends.
p145
aVI'm speaking of the people who shape your weekly emotional experience.
p146
aVMy mother in Accra, my twin sister in Boston,
p147
aVmy best friends in New York:
p148
aVthese relationships are home for me.
p149
aV"R" number two, relationships.
p150
aa(lp151
VWe're local where we carry out our rituals and relationships,
p152
aVbut how we experience our locality
p153
aVdepends in part on our restrictions.
p154
aVBy restrictions, I mean, where are you able to live?
p155
aVWhat passport do you hold?
p156
aVAre you restricted by, say, racism, from feeling fully at home where you live?
p157
aVBy civil war, dysfunctional governance, economic inflation,
p158
aVfrom living in the locality where you had your rituals as a child?
p159
aVThis is the least sexy of the R\u2019s,
p160
aVless lyric than rituals and relationships,
p161
aVbut the question takes us past "Where are you now?"
p162
aVto "Why aren't you there, and why?"
p163
aVRituals, relationships, restrictions.
p164
aa(lp165
VTake a piece of paper
p166
aVand put those three words on top of three columns,
p167
aVthen try to fill those columns as honestly as you can.
p168
aVA very different picture of your life in local context,
p169
aVof your identity as a set of experiences,
p170
aVmay emerge.
p171
aa(lp172
VSo let's try it.
p173
aVI have a friend named Olu.
p174
aVHe's 35 years old.
p175
aVHis parents, born in Nigeria, came to Germany on scholarships.
p176
aVOlu was born in Nuremberg and lived there until age 10.
p177
aVWhen his family moved to Lagos, he studied in London,
p178
aVthen came to Berlin.
p179
aVHe loves going to Nigeria \u2014
p180
aVthe weather, the food, the friends \u2014
p181
aVbut hates the political corruption there.
p182
aVWhere is Olu from?
p183
aa(lp184
VI have another friend named Udo.
p185
aVHe's also 35 years old.
p186
aVUdo was born in Córdoba, in northwest Argentina,
p187
aVwhere his grandparents migrated from Germany, what is now Poland,
p188
aVafter the war.
p189
aVUdo studied in Buenos Aires, and nine years ago came to Berlin.
p190
aVHe loves going to Argentina \u2014  the weather, the food, the friends \u2014
p191
aVbut hates the economic corruption there.
p192
aVWhere is Udo from?
p193
aVWith his blonde hair and blue eyes, Udo could pass for German,
p194
aVbut holds an Argentinian passport, so needs a visa to live in Berlin.
p195
aVThat Udo is from Argentina has largely to do with history.
p196
aVThat he's a local of Buenos Aires and Berlin,
p197
aVthat has to do with life.
p198
aa(lp199
VOlu, who looks Nigerian, needs a visa to visit Nigeria.
p200
aVHe speaks Yoruba with an English accent,
p201
aVand English with a German one.
p202
aVTo claim that he's "not really Nigerian," though,
p203
aVdenies his experience in Lagos,
p204
aVthe rituals he practiced growing up,
p205
aVhis relationship with family and friends.
p206
aa(lp207
VMeanwhile, though Lagos is undoubtedly one of his homes,
p208
aVOlu always feels restricted there,
p209
aVnot least by the fact that he's gay.
p210
aa(lp211
VBoth he and Udo are restricted by the political conditions
p212
aVof their parents' countries,
p213
aVfrom living where some of their most meaningful rituals
p214
aVand relationships occur.
p215
aVTo say Olu is from Nigeria and Udo is from Argentina
p216
aVdistracts from their common experience.
p217
aVTheir rituals, their relationships, and their restrictions are the same.
p218
aa(lp219
VOf course, when we ask, "Where are you from?"
p220
aVwe're using a kind of shorthand.
p221
aVIt's quicker to say "Nigeria" than "Lagos and Berlin,"
p222
aVand as with Google Maps, we can always zoom in closer,
p223
aVfrom country to city to neighborhood.
p224
aVBut that's not quite the point.
p225
aVThe difference between "Where are you from?"
p226
aVand "Where are you a local?"
p227
aVisn't the specificity of the answer;
p228
aVit's the intention of the question.
p229
aVReplacing the language of nationality with the language of locality asks us
p230
aVto shift our focus to where real life occurs.
p231
aVEven that most glorious expression of countryhood, the World Cup,
p232
aVgives us national teams comprised mostly of multilocal players.
p233
aVAs a unit of measurement for human experience,
p234
aVthe country doesn't quite work.
p235
aVThat's why Olu says, "I'm German, but my parents come from Nigeria."
p236
aVThe "but" in that sentence belies the inflexibility of the units,
p237
aVone fixed and fictional entity bumping up against another.
p238
aV"I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin," suggests overlapping experiences,
p239
aVlayers that merge together, that can't be denied or removed.
p240
aVYou can take away my passport,
p241
aVbut you can't take away my experience.
p242
aVThat I carry within me.
p243
aVWhere I'm from comes wherever I go.
p244
aa(lp245
VTo be clear, I'm not suggesting that we do away with countries.
p246
aVThere's much to be said for national history,
p247
aVmore for the sovereign state.
p248
aVCulture exists in community, and community exists in context.
p249
aVGeography, tradition, collective memory: these things are important.
p250
aVWhat I'm questioning is primacy.
p251
aVAll of those introductions on tour began with reference to nation,
p252
aVas if knowing what country I came from would tell my audience who I was.
p253
aVWhat are we really seeking, though, when we ask where someone comes from?
p254
aVAnd what are we really seeing when we hear an answer?
p255
aa(lp256
VHere's one possibility:
p257
aVbasically, countries represent power.
p258
aV"Where are you from?" Mexico. Poland. Bangladesh. Less power.
p259
aVAmerica. Germany. Japan. More power.
p260
aVChina. Russia. Ambiguous.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Laughter)
p263
aa(lp264
VIt's possible that without realizing it, we're playing a power game,
p265
aVespecially in the context of multi-ethnic countries.
p266
aVAs any recent immigrant knows,
p267
aVthe question "Where are you from?" or "Where are you really from?"
p268
aVis often code for "Why are you here?"
p269
aa(lp270
VThen we have the scholar William Deresiewicz's writing
p271
aVof elite American colleges.
p272
aV"Students think that their environment is diverse
p273
aVif one comes from Missouri and another from Pakistan \u2014
p274
aVnever mind that all of their parents are doctors or bankers."
p275
aa(lp276
VI'm with him.
p277
aVTo call one student American, another Pakistani,
p278
aVthen triumphantly claim student body diversity
p279
aVignores the fact that these students are locals of the same milieu.
p280
aVThe same holds true on the other end of the economic spectrum.
p281
aVA Mexican gardener in Los Angeles and a Nepali housekeeper in Delhi
p282
aVhave more in common in terms of rituals and restrictions
p283
aVthan nationality implies.
p284
aa(lp285
VPerhaps my biggest problem with coming from countries
p286
aVis the myth of going back to them.
p287
aVI'm often asked if I plan to "go back" to Ghana.
p288
aVI go to Accra every year, but I can't "go back" to Ghana.
p289
aVIt's not because I wasn't born there.
p290
aVMy father can't go back, either.
p291
aVThe country in which he was born,
p292
aVthat country no longer exists.
p293
aVWe can never go back to a place and find it exactly where we left it.
p294
aVSomething, somewhere will always have changed,
p295
aVmost of all, ourselves.
p296
aVPeople.
p297
aa(lp298
VFinally, what we're talking about is human experience,
p299
aVthis notoriously and gloriously disorderly affair.
p300
aVIn creative writing, locality bespeaks humanity.
p301
aVThe more we know about where a story is set,
p302
aVthe more local color and texture,
p303
aVthe more human the characters start to feel,
p304
aVthe more relatable, not less.
p305
aVThe myth of national identity and the vocabulary of coming from
p306
aVconfuses us into placing ourselves into mutually exclusive categories.
p307
aVIn fact, all of us are multi \u2014 multi-local, multi-layered.
p308
aVTo begin our conversations with an acknowledgement of this complexity
p309
aVbrings us closer together, I think, not further apart.
p310
aVSo the next time that I'm introduced,
p311
aVI'd love to hear the truth:
p312
aV"Taiye Selasi is a human being, like everybody here.
p313
aVShe isn't a citizen of the world, but a citizen of worlds.
p314
aVShe is a local of New York, Rome and Accra."
p315
aa(lp316
VThank you.

aa(lp318
V(Applause)
