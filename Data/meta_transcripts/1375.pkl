VPeter Diamandis: So those are just a few of the clips
p16
aVI collected over the last six months \u2014
p17
aVcould have easily been the last six days
p18
aVor the last six years.
p19
aVThe point is that the news media
p20
aVpreferentially feeds us negative stories
p21
aVbecause that's what our minds pay attention to.
p22
aVAnd there's a very good reason for that.
p23
aVEvery second of every day,
p24
aVour senses bring in way too much data
p25
aVthan we can possibly process in our brains.
p26
aa(lp27
VAnd because nothing is more important to us
p28
aVthan survival,
p29
aVthe first stop of all of that data
p30
aVis an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe
p31
aVcalled the amygdala.
p32
aVNow the amygdala is our early warning detector,
p33
aVour danger detector.
p34
aVIt sorts and scours through all of the information
p35
aVlooking for anything in the environment that might harm us.
p36
aVSo given a dozen news stories,
p37
aVwe will preferentially look
p38
aVat the negative news.
p39
aVAnd that old newspaper saying,
p40
aV"If it bleeds it leads,"
p41
aVis very true.
p42
aVSo given all of our digital devices
p43
aVthat are bringing all the negative news to us
p44
aVseven days a week, 24 hours a day,
p45
aVit's no wonder that we're pessimistic.
p46
aVIt's no wonder that people think
p47
aVthat the world is getting worse.
p48
aa(lp49
VBut perhaps that's not the case.
p50
aVPerhaps instead,
p51
aVit's the distortions brought to us
p52
aVof what's really going on.
p53
aVPerhaps the tremendous progress we've made
p54
aVover the last century
p55
aVby a series of forces
p56
aVare, in fact, accelerating to a point
p57
aVthat we have the potential in the next three decades
p58
aVto create a world of abundance.
p59
aVNow I'm not saying
p60
aVwe don't have our set of problems \u2014
p61
aVclimate crisis, species extinction,
p62
aVwater and energy shortage \u2014 we surely do.
p63
aVAnd as humans, we are far better
p64
aVat seeing the problems way in advance,
p65
aVbut ultimately we knock them down.
p66
aa(lp67
VSo let's look
p68
aVat what this last century has been
p69
aVto see where we're going.
p70
aVOver the last hundred years,
p71
aVthe average human lifespan has more than doubled,
p72
aVaverage per capita income adjusted for inflation
p73
aVaround the world has tripled.
p74
aVChildhood mortality
p75
aVhas come down a factor of 10.
p76
aVAdd to that the cost of food, electricity,
p77
aVtransportation, communication
p78
aVhave dropped 10 to 1,000-fold.
p79
aVSteve Pinker has showed us
p80
aVthat, in fact, we're living during the most peaceful time ever
p81
aVin human history.
p82
aVAnd Charles Kenny
p83
aVthat global literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent
p84
aVin the last 130 years.
p85
aVWe truly are living in an extraordinary time.
p86
aVAnd many people forget this.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd we keep setting our expectations higher and higher.
p89
aVIn fact, we redefine what poverty means.
p90
aVThink of this, in America today,
p91
aVthe majority of people under the poverty line
p92
aVstill have electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators,
p93
aVtelevision, mobile phones,
p94
aVair conditioning and cars.
p95
aVThe wealthiest robber barons of the last century, the emperors on this planet,
p96
aVcould have never dreamed of such luxuries.
p97
aa(lp98
VUnderpinning much of this
p99
aVis technology,
p100
aVand of late,
p101
aVexponentially growing technologies.
p102
aVMy good friend Ray Kurzweil
p103
aVshowed that any tool that becomes an information technology
p104
aVjumps on this curve, on Moore's Law,
p105
aVand experiences price performance doubling
p106
aVevery 12 to 24 months.
p107
aVThat's why the cellphone in your pocket
p108
aVis literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster
p109
aVthan a supercomputer of the '70s.
p110
aVNow look at this curve.
p111
aVThis is Moore's Law over the last hundred years.
p112
aVI want you to notice two things from this curve.
p113
aVNumber one, how smooth it is \u2014
p114
aVthrough good time and bad time, war time and peace time,
p115
aVrecession, depression and boom time.
p116
aVThis is the result of faster computers
p117
aVbeing used to build faster computers.
p118
aVIt doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges.
p119
aVAnd also, even though it's plotted
p120
aVon a log curve on the left,
p121
aVit's curving upwards.
p122
aVThe rate at which the technology is getting faster
p123
aVis itself getting faster.
p124
aa(lp125
VAnd on this curve, riding on Moore's Law,
p126
aVare a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies
p127
aVavailable to all of us.
p128
aVCloud computing,
p129
aVwhat my friends at Autodesk call infinite computing;
p130
aVsensors and networks; robotics;
p131
aV3D printing, which is the ability to democratize and distribute
p132
aVpersonalized production around the planet;
p133
aVsynthetic biology;
p134
aVfuels, vaccines and foods;
p135
aVdigital medicine; nanomaterials; and A.I.
p136
aVI mean, how many of you saw the winning of Jeopardy
p137
aVby IBM's Watson?
p138
aVI mean, that was epic.
p139
aVIn fact, I scoured the headlines
p140
aVlooking for the best headline in a newspaper I could.
p141
aVAnd I love this: "Watson Vanquishes Human Opponents."
p142
aVJeopardy's not an easy game.
p143
aVIt's about the nuance of human language.
p144
aVAnd imagine if you would
p145
aVA.I.'s like this on the cloud
p146
aVavailable to every person with a cellphone.
p147
aa(lp148
VFour years ago here at TED,
p149
aVRay Kurzweil and I started a new university
p150
aVcalled Singularity University.
p151
aVAnd we teach our students all of these technologies,
p152
aVand particularly how they can be used
p153
aVto solve humanity's grand challenges.
p154
aVAnd every year we ask them
p155
aVto start a company or a product or a service
p156
aVthat can affect positively the lives of a billion people
p157
aVwithin a decade.
p158
aVThink about that, the fact that, literally, a group of students
p159
aVcan touch the lives of a billion people today.
p160
aV30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous.
p161
aVToday we can point at dozens of companies
p162
aVthat have done just that.
p163
aa(lp164
VWhen I think about creating abundance,
p165
aVit's not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet;
p166
aVit's about creating a life of possibility.
p167
aVIt is about taking that which was scarce
p168
aVand making it abundant.
p169
aVYou see, scarcity is contextual,
p170
aVand technology is a resource-liberating force.
p171
aVLet me give you an example.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo this is a story of Napoleon III
p174
aVin the mid-1800s.
p175
aVHe's the dude on the left.
p176
aVHe invited over to dinner
p177
aVthe king of Siam.
p178
aVAll of Napoleon's troops
p179
aVwere fed with silver utensils,
p180
aVNapoleon himself with gold utensils.
p181
aVBut the King of Siam,
p182
aVhe was fed with aluminum utensils.
p183
aVYou see, aluminum
p184
aVwas the most valuable metal on the planet,
p185
aVworth more than gold and platinum.
p186
aVIt's the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument
p187
aVis made of aluminum.
p188
aVYou see, even though aluminum
p189
aVis 8.3 percent of the Earth by mass,
p190
aVit doesn't come as a pure metal.
p191
aVIt's all bound by oxygen and silicates.
p192
aVBut then the technology of electrolysis came along
p193
aVand literally made aluminum so cheap
p194
aVthat we use it with throw-away mentality.
p195
aa(lp196
VSo let's project this analogy going forward.
p197
aVWe think about energy scarcity.
p198
aVLadies and gentlemen,
p199
aVwe are on a planet
p200
aVthat is bathed with 5,000 times more energy
p201
aVthan we use in a year.
p202
aV16 terawatts of energy hits the Earth's surface
p203
aVevery 88 minutes.
p204
aVIt's not about being scarce,
p205
aVit's about accessibility.
p206
aVAnd there's good news here.
p207
aVFor the first time, this year
p208
aVthe cost of solar-generated electricity
p209
aVis 50 percent that of diesel-generated electricity in India \u2014
p210
aV8.8 rupees versus 17 rupees.
p211
aVThe cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year.
p212
aVLast month, MIT put out a study
p213
aVshowing that by the end of this decade,
p214
aVin the sunny parts of the United States,
p215
aVsolar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour
p216
aVcompared to 15 cents
p217
aVas a national average.
p218
aa(lp219
VAnd if we have abundant energy,
p220
aVwe also have abundant water.
p221
aVNow we talk about water wars.
p222
aVDo you remember
p223
aVwhen Carl Sagan turned the Voyager spacecraft
p224
aVback towards the Earth,
p225
aVin 1990 after it just passed Saturn?
p226
aVHe took a famous photo. What was it called?
p227
aV"A Pale Blue Dot."
p228
aVBecause we live on a water planet.
p229
aVWe live on a planet 70 percent covered by water.
p230
aVYes, 97.5 percent is saltwater,
p231
aVtwo percent is ice,
p232
aVand we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet,
p233
aVbut here too there is hope.
p234
aVAnd there is technology coming online,
p235
aVnot 10, 20 years from now,
p236
aVright now.
p237
aVThere's nanotechnology coming on, nanomaterials.
p238
aa(lp239
VAnd the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning,
p240
aVone of the great DIY innovators,
p241
aVI'd like to share with you \u2014 he gave me permission to do so \u2014
p242
aVhis technology called Slingshot
p243
aVthat many of you may have heard of,
p244
aVit is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator.
p245
aVIt's able to generate
p246
aVa thousand liters of clean drinking water a day
p247
aVout of any source \u2014 saltwater, polluted water, latrine \u2014
p248
aVat less than two cents a liter.
p249
aVThe chairman of Coca-Cola has just agreed
p250
aVto do a major test
p251
aVof hundreds of units of this in the developing world.
p252
aVAnd if that pans out,
p253
aVwhich I have every confidence it will,
p254
aVCoca-Cola will deploy this globally
p255
aVto 206 countries
p256
aVaround the planet.
p257
aVThis is the kind of innovation, empowered by this technology,
p258
aVthat exists today.
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd we've seen this in cellphones.
p261
aVMy goodness, we're going to hit 70 percent penetration
p262
aVof cellphones in the developing world
p263
aVby the end of 2013.
p264
aVThink about it,
p265
aVthat a Masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of Kenya
p266
aVhas better mobile comm
p267
aVthan President Reagan did 25 years ago.
p268
aVAnd if they're on a smartphone on Google,
p269
aVthey've got access to more knowledge and information
p270
aVthan President Clinton did 15 years ago.
p271
aVThey're living in a world of information and communication abundance
p272
aVthat no one could have ever predicted.
p273
aVBetter than that,
p274
aVthe things that you and I
p275
aVspent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for \u2014
p276
aVGPS, HD video and still images,
p277
aVlibraries of books and music,
p278
aVmedical diagnostic technology \u2014
p279
aVare now literally dematerializing and demonetizing
p280
aVinto your cellphone.
p281
aa(lp282
VProbably the best part of it
p283
aVis what's coming down the pike in health.
p284
aVLast month, I had the pleasure of announcing with Qualcomm Foundation
p285
aVsomething called the $10 million Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize.
p286
aVWe're challenging teams around the world
p287
aVto basically combine these technologies
p288
aVinto a mobile device
p289
aVthat you can speak to, because it's got A.I.,
p290
aVyou can cough on it, you can do a finger blood prick.
p291
aVAnd to win, it needs to be able to diagnose you better
p292
aVthan a team of board-certified doctors.
p293
aVSo literally, imagine this device
p294
aVin the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors,
p295
aV25 percent of the disease burden
p296
aVand 1.3 percent of the health care workers.
p297
aVWhen this device sequences an RNA or DNA virus
p298
aVthat it doesn't recognize,
p299
aVit calls the CDC
p300
aVand prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place.
p301
aa(lp302
VBut here, here is the biggest force
p303
aVfor bringing about a world of abundance.
p304
aVI call it the rising billion.
p305
aVSo the white lines here are population.
p306
aVWe just passed the seven billion mark on Earth.
p307
aVAnd by the way,
p308
aVthe biggest protection against a population explosion
p309
aVis making the world educated
p310
aVand healthy.
p311
aVIn 2010,
p312
aVwe had just short of two billion people
p313
aVonline, connected.
p314
aVBy 2020,
p315
aVthat's going from two billion to five billion
p316
aVInternet users.
p317
aVThree billion new minds
p318
aVwho have never been heard from before
p319
aVare connecting to the global conversation.
p320
aVWhat will these people want?
p321
aVWhat will they consume? What will they desire?
p322
aVAnd rather than having economic shutdown,
p323
aVwe're about to have the biggest economic injection ever.
p324
aVThese people represent
p325
aVtens of trillions of dollars
p326
aVinjected into the global economy.
p327
aVAnd they will get healthier
p328
aVby using the Tricorder,
p329
aVand they'll become better educated by using the Khan Academy,
p330
aVand by literally being able to use
p331
aV3D printing and infinite computing
p332
aV[become] more productive than ever before.
p333
aa(lp334
VSo what could three billion rising,
p335
aVhealthy, educated, productive members of humanity
p336
aVbring to us?
p337
aVHow about a set of voices that have never been heard from before.
p338
aVWhat about giving the oppressed,
p339
aVwherever they might be,
p340
aVthe voice to be heard and the voice to act
p341
aVfor the first time ever?
p342
aVWhat will these three billion people bring?
p343
aVWhat about contributions we can't even predict?
p344
aVThe one thing I've learned at the X Prize
p345
aVis that small teams
p346
aVdriven by their passion with a clear focus
p347
aVcan do extraordinary things,
p348
aVthings that large corporations and governments
p349
aVcould only do in the past.
p350
aa(lp351
VLet me share and close with a story
p352
aVthat really got me excited.
p353
aVThere is a program that some of you might have heard of.
p354
aVIt's a game called Foldit.
p355
aVIt came out of the University of Washington in Seattle.
p356
aVAnd this is a game
p357
aVwhere individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids
p358
aVand figure out how the protein is going to fold.
p359
aVAnd how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality.
p360
aVAnd it's very important for research in medicine.
p361
aVAnd up until now, it's been a supercomputer problem.
p362
aa(lp363
VAnd this game has been played
p364
aVby university professors and so forth.
p365
aVAnd it's literally, hundreds of thousands of people
p366
aVcame online and started playing it.
p367
aVAnd it showed that, in fact, today,
p368
aVthe human pattern recognition machinery
p369
aVis better at folding proteins than the best computers.
p370
aVAnd when these individuals went and looked
p371
aVat who was the best protein folder in the world,
p372
aVit wasn't an MIT professor,
p373
aVit wasn't a CalTech student,
p374
aVit was a person from England, from Manchester,
p375
aVa woman who, during the day,
p376
aVwas an executive assistant at a rehab clinic
p377
aVand, at night, was the world's best protein folder.
p378
aa(lp379
VLadies and gentlemen,
p380
aVwhat gives me tremendous confidence
p381
aVin the future
p382
aVis the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals
p383
aVto take on the grand challenges of this planet.
p384
aVWe have the tools with this exponential technology.
p385
aVWe have the passion of the DIY innovator.
p386
aVWe have the capital of the techno-philanthropist.
p387
aVAnd we have three billion new minds
p388
aVcoming online to work with us
p389
aVto solve the grand challenges,
p390
aVto do that which we must do.
p391
aVWe are living into extraordinary decades ahead.
p392
