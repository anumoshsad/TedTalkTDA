VDo you know
p4
aVthat we have 1.4 million cellular radio masts
p5
aVdeployed worldwide?
p6
aVAnd these are base stations.
p7
aVAnd we also have
p8
aVmore than five billion
p9
aVof these devices here.
p10
aVThese are cellular mobile phones.
p11
aVAnd with these mobile phones,
p12
aVwe transmit more than 600 terabytes of data
p13
aVevery month.
p14
aVThis is a 6 with 14 zeroes \u2014
p15
aVa very large number.
p16
aVAnd wireless communications
p17
aVhas become a utility
p18
aVlike electricity and water.
p19
aVWe use it everyday. We use it in our everyday lives now \u2014
p20
aVin our private lives, in our business lives.
p21
aVAnd we even have to be asked sometimes, very kindly,
p22
aVto switch off the mobile phone at events like this
p23
aVfor good reasons.
p24
aVAnd it's this importance
p25
aVwhy I decided to look into the issues
p26
aVthat this technology has,
p27
aVbecause it's so fundamental to our lives.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd one of the issues is capacity.
p30
aVThe way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves \u2014
p31
aVin particular, radio waves.
p32
aVAnd radio waves are limited.
p33
aVThey are scarce; they are expensive;
p34
aVand we only have a certain range of it.
p35
aVAnd it's this limitation
p36
aVthat doesn't cope
p37
aVwith the demand of wireless data transmissions
p38
aVand the number of bytes and data which are transmitted every month.
p39
aVAnd we are simply running out of spectrum.
p40
aVThere's another problem.
p41
aVThat is efficiency.
p42
aVThese 1.4 million cellular radio masts, or base stations,
p43
aVconsume a lot of energy.
p44
aVAnd mind you, most of the energy
p45
aVis not used to transmit the radio waves,
p46
aVit is used to cool the base stations.
p47
aVThen the efficiency of such a base station
p48
aVis only at about five percent.
p49
aVAnd that creates a big problem.
p50
aVThen there's another issue that you're all aware of.
p51
aVYou have to switch off your mobile phone
p52
aVduring flights.
p53
aVIn hospitals, they are security issues.
p54
aVAnd security is another issue.
p55
aVThese radio waves penetrate through walls.
p56
aVThey can be intercepted,
p57
aVand somebody can make use of your network
p58
aVif he has bad intentions.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo these are the main four issues.
p61
aVBut on the other hand,
p62
aVwe have 14 billion of these:
p63
aVlight bulbs, light.
p64
aVAnd light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
p65
aVSo let's look at this in the context
p66
aVof the entire electromagnetic spectrum, where we have gamma rays.
p67
aVYou don't want to get close to gamma rays, it could be dangerous.
p68
aVX-rays, useful when you go to hospitals.
p69
aVThen there's ultraviolet light.
p70
aVit's good for a nice suntan,
p71
aVbut otherwise dangerous for the human body.
p72
aVInfrared \u2014
p73
aVdue to eye safety regulations,
p74
aVcan be only used with low power.
p75
aVAnd then we have the radio waves, they have the issues I've just mentioned.
p76
aVAnd in the middle there, we have this visible light spectrum.
p77
aVIt's light,
p78
aVand light has been around for many millions of years.
p79
aVAnd in fact, it has created us,
p80
aVhas created life,
p81
aVhas created all the stuff of life.
p82
aVSo it's inherently safe to use.
p83
aVAnd wouldn't it be great to use that for wireless communications?
p84
aa(lp85
VNot only that, I compared [it to] the entire spectrum.
p86
aVI compared the radio waves spectrum \u2014
p87
aVthe size of it \u2014
p88
aVwith the size of the visible light spectrum.
p89
aVAnd guess what?
p90
aVWe have 10,000 times more of that spectrum,
p91
aVwhich is there for us to use.
p92
aVSo not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum,
p93
aVlet's compare that with a number I've just mentioned.
p94
aVWe have 1.4 million
p95
aVexpensively deployed,
p96
aVinefficient radio cellular base stations.
p97
aVAnd multiply that by 10,000,
p98
aVthen you end up at 14 billion.
p99
aV14 billion is the number of light bulbs installed already.
p100
aVSo we have the infrastructure there.
p101
aVLook at the ceiling, you see all these light bulbs.
p102
aVGo to the main floor, you see these light bulbs.
p103
aa(lp104
VCan we use them for communications?
p105
aVYes.
p106
aVWhat do we need to do?
p107
aVThe one thing we need to do
p108
aVis we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs,
p109
aVflorescent lights,
p110
aVwith this new technology of LED,
p111
aVLED light bulbs.
p112
aVAn LED is a semiconductor. It's an electronic device.
p113
aVAnd it has a very nice acute property.
p114
aVIts intensity can be modulated
p115
aVat very high speeds,
p116
aVand it can be switched off at very high speeds.
p117
aVAnd this is a fundamental basic property
p118
aVthat we exploit
p119
aVwith our technology.
p120
aVSo let's show how we do that.
p121
aVLet's go to the closest neighbor to the visible light spectrum \u2014
p122
aVgo to remote controls.
p123
aVYou all know remote controls have an infrared LED \u2014
p124
aVbasically you switch on the LED, and if it's off, you switch it off.
p125
aVAnd it creates a simple, low-speed data stream
p126
aVin 10,000 bits per second,
p127
aV20,000 bits per second.
p128
aVNot usable for a YouTube video.
p129
aa(lp130
VWhat we have done
p131
aVis we have developed a technology
p132
aVwith which we can furthermore
p133
aVreplace the remote control of our light bulb.
p134
aVWe transmit with our technology,
p135
aVnot only a single data stream,
p136
aVwe transmit thousands of data streams
p137
aVin parallel,
p138
aVat even higher speeds.
p139
aVAnd the technology we have developed \u2014
p140
aVit's called SIM OFDM.
p141
aVAnd it's spacial modulation \u2014
p142
aVthese are the only technical terms, I'm not going into details \u2014
p143
aVbut this is how we enabled
p144
aVthat light source
p145
aVto transmit data.
p146
aa(lp147
VYou will say, "Okay, this is nice \u2014
p148
aVa slide created in 10 minutes."
p149
aVBut not only that.
p150
aVWhat we've done
p151
aVis we have also developed a demonstrator.
p152
aVAnd I'm showing for the first time in public
p153
aVthis visible light demonstrator.
p154
aVAnd what we have here
p155
aVis no ordinary desk lamp.
p156
aVWe fit in an LED light bulb,
p157
aVworth three U.S. dollars,
p158
aVput in our signal processing technology.
p159
aVAnd then what we have here is a little hole.
p160
aVAnd the light goes through that hole.
p161
aVThere's a receiver.
p162
aVThe receiver will convert these little, subtle changes in the amplitude
p163
aVthat we create there
p164
aVinto an electrical signal.
p165
aVAnd that signal is then converted back
p166
aVto a high-speed data stream.
p167
aVIn the future we hope
p168
aVthat we can integrate this little hole
p169
aVinto these smart phones.
p170
aVAnd not only integrate a photo detector here,
p171
aVbut maybe use the camera inside.
p172
aa(lp173
VSo what happens
p174
aVwhen I switch on that light?
p175
aVAs you would expect,
p176
aVit's a light, a desk lamp.
p177
aVPut your book beneath it and you can read.
p178
aVIt's illuminating the space.
p179
aVBut at the same time, you see this video coming up here.
p180
aVAnd that's a video, a high-definition video
p181
aVthat is transmitted through that light beam.
p182
aVYou're critical.
p183
aVYou think, "Ha, ha, ha.
p184
aVThis is a smart academic doing a little bit of tricks here."
p185
aVBut let me do this.
p186
aa(lp187
V(Applause)
p188
aa(lp189
VOnce again.
p190
aVStill don't believe?
p191
aVIt is this light
p192
aVthat transmits this high-definition video in a split stream.
p193
aVAnd if you look at the light,
p194
aVit is illuminating as you would expect.
p195
aVYou don't notice with your human eye.
p196
aVYou don't notice the subtle changes in the amplitude
p197
aVthat we impress onto this light bulb.
p198
aVIt's serving the purpose of illumination,
p199
aVbut at the same time, we are able to transmit this data.
p200
aVAnd you see,
p201
aVeven light from the ceiling comes down here to the receiver.
p202
aVIt can ignore that constant light,
p203
aVbecause all the receiver's interested in
p204
aVare subtle changes.
p205
aVYou also have a critical question now, and
p206
aVyou say, "Okay,
p207
aVdo I have to have the light on all the time
p208
aVto have this working?"
p209
aVAnd the answer is yes.
p210
aVBut, you can dim down the light
p211
aVto a level that it appears to be off.
p212
aVAnd you are still able to transmit data \u2014 that's possible.
p213
aa(lp214
VSo I've mentioned to you the four challenges.
p215
aVCapacity:
p216
aVWe have 10,000 times more spectrum,
p217
aV10,000 times more LEDs
p218
aVinstalled already in the infrastructure there.
p219
aVYou would agree with me, hopefully,
p220
aVthere's no issue of capacity anymore.
p221
aVEfficiency:
p222
aVThis is data through illumination \u2014
p223
aVit's first of all an illumination device.
p224
aVAnd if you do the energy budget,
p225
aVthe data transmission comes for free \u2014
p226
aVhighly energy efficient.
p227
aVI don't mention the high energy efficiency
p228
aVof these LED light bulbs.
p229
aVIf the whole world would deploy them,
p230
aVyou would save hundreds of power plants.
p231
aVThat's aside.
p232
aa(lp233
VAnd then I've mentioned the availability.
p234
aVYou will agree with me that we have lights in the hospital.
p235
aVYou need to see what to do.
p236
aVYou have lights in an aircraft.
p237
aVSo it's everywhere in a day there is light.
p238
aVLook around. Everywhere. Look at your smart phone.
p239
aVIt has a flashlight, an LED flashlight.
p240
aVThese are potential sources for high-speed data transmission.
p241
aa(lp242
VAnd then there's security.
p243
aVYou would agree with me
p244
aVthat light doesn't penetrate through walls.
p245
aVSo no one, if I have a light here,
p246
aVif I have secure data,
p247
aVno one on the other side of this room through that wall
p248
aVwould be able to read that data.
p249
aVAnd there's only data where there is light.
p250
aVSo if I don't want that receiver to receive the data,
p251
aVthen what I could do,
p252
aVturn it away.
p253
aVSo the data goes in that direction, not there anymore.
p254
aVNow we can in fact see where the data is going to.
p255
aa(lp256
VSo for me,
p257
aVthe applications of it,
p258
aVto me, are beyond imagination at the moment.
p259
aVWe have had a century of very nice, smart application developers.
p260
aVAnd you only have to notice, where we have light,
p261
aVthere is a potential way to transmit data.
p262
aVBut I can give you a few examples.
p263
aVWell you may see the impact already now.
p264
aVThis is a remote operated vehicle
p265
aVbeneath the ocean.
p266
aVAnd they use light to illuminate space down there.
p267
aVAnd this light can be used to transmit wireless data
p268
aVthat these things [use] to communicate with each other.
p269
aa(lp270
VIntrinsically safe environments
p271
aVlike this petrochemical plant \u2014
p272
aVyou can't use RF, it may generate antenna sparks,
p273
aVbut you can use light \u2014 you see plenty of light there.
p274
aVIn hospitals,
p275
aVfor new medical instruments;
p276
aVin streets for traffic control.
p277
aVCars have LED-based headlights, LED-based back lights,
p278
aVand cars can communicate with each other
p279
aVand prevent accidents
p280
aVin the way that they exchange information.
p281
aVTraffic lights can communicate to the car and so on.
p282
aVAnd then you have these millions of street lamps
p283
aVdeployed around the world.
p284
aVAnd every street lamp could be a free access point.
p285
aVWe call it, in fact, a Li-Fi,
p286
aVlight-fidelity.
p287
aVAnd then we have these aircraft cabins.
p288
aVThere are hundreds of lights in an aircraft cabin,
p289
aVand each of these lights
p290
aVcould be a potential transmitter of wireless data.
p291
aVSo you could enjoy your most favorite TED video
p292
aVon your long flight back home.
p293
aVOnline life. So that is a vision, I think, that is possible.
p294
aa(lp295
VSo, all we would need to do
p296
aVis to fit a small microchip
p297
aVto every potential illumination device.
p298
aVAnd this would then combine
p299
aVtwo basic functionalities:
p300
aVillumination and wireless data transmission.
p301
aVAnd it's this symbiosis that I personally believe
p302
aVcould solve the four essential problems
p303
aVthat face us in wireless communication these days.
p304
aVAnd in the future,
p305
aVyou would not only have 14 billion light bulbs,
p306
aVyou may have 14 billion Li-Fis
p307
aVdeployed worldwide \u2014
p308
aVfor a cleaner, a greener,
p309
aVand even a brighter future.
