VFirst, a video.
p4
aVYes, it is a scrambled egg.
p5
aVBut as you look at it,
p6
aVI hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy.
p7
aVBecause you may notice that what's actually happening
p8
aVis that the egg is unscrambling itself.
p9
aVAnd you'll now see the yolk and the white have separated.
p10
aVAnd now they're going to be poured back into the egg.
p11
aVAnd we all know in our heart of hearts
p12
aVthat this is not the way the universe works.
p13
aVA scrambled egg is mush \u2014 tasty mush \u2014 but it's mush.
p14
aVAn egg is a beautiful, sophisticated thing
p15
aVthat can create even more sophisticated things,
p16
aVsuch as chickens.
p17
aVAnd we know in our heart of hearts
p18
aVthat the universe does not travel from mush to complexity.
p19
aVIn fact, this gut instinct
p20
aVis reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics,
p21
aVthe second law of thermodynamics, or the law of entropy.
p22
aVWhat that says basically
p23
aVis that the general tendency of the universe
p24
aVis to move from order and structure
p25
aVto lack of order, lack of structure \u2014
p26
aVin fact, to mush.
p27
aVAnd that's why that video feels a bit strange.
p28
aa(lp29
VAnd yet, look around us.
p30
aVWhat we see around us is staggering complexity.
p31
aVEric Beinhocker estimates that in New York City alone,
p32
aVthere are some 10 billion SKUs, or distinct commodities, being traded.
p33
aVThat's hundreds of times as many species as there are on Earth.
p34
aVAnd they're being traded by a species of almost seven billion individuals,
p35
aVwho are linked by trade, travel, and the Internet
p36
aVinto a global system of stupendous complexity.
p37
aa(lp38
VSo here's a great puzzle:
p39
aVin a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics,
p40
aVhow is it possible
p41
aVto generate the sort of complexity I've described,
p42
aVthe sort of complexity represented by you and me
p43
aVand the convention center?
p44
aVWell, the answer seems to be,
p45
aVthe universe can create complexity,
p46
aVbut with great difficulty.
p47
aVIn pockets,
p48
aVthere appear what my colleague, Fred Spier,
p49
aVcalls "Goldilocks conditions" \u2014
p50
aVnot too hot, not too cold,
p51
aVjust right for the creation of complexity.
p52
aVAnd slightly more complex things appear.
p53
aVAnd where you have slightly more complex things,
p54
aVyou can get slightly more complex things.
p55
aVAnd in this way, complexity builds stage by stage.
p56
aVEach stage is magical
p57
aVbecause it creates the impression of something utterly new
p58
aVappearing almost out of nowhere in the universe.
p59
aVWe refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments.
p60
aVAnd at each threshold, the going gets tougher.
p61
aVThe complex things get more fragile,
p62
aVmore vulnerable;
p63
aVthe Goldilocks conditions get more stringent,
p64
aVand it's more difficult to create complexity.
p65
aa(lp66
VNow, we, as extremely complex creatures,
p67
aVdesperately need to know this story
p68
aVof how the universe creates complexity despite the second law,
p69
aVand why complexity means vulnerability and fragility.
p70
aVAnd that's the story that we tell in big history.
p71
aVBut to do it, you have do something
p72
aVthat may, at first sight, seem completely impossible.
p73
aVYou have to survey the whole history of the universe.
p74
aVSo let's do it.
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
VLet's begin by winding the timeline back
p79
aV13.7 billion years,
p80
aVto the beginning of time.
p81
aa(lp82
VAround us, there's nothing.
p83
aVThere's not even time or space.
p84
aVImagine the darkest, emptiest thing you can
p85
aVand cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are.
p86
aVAnd then suddenly,
p87
aVbang!
p88
aVA universe appears, an entire universe.
p89
aVAnd we've crossed our first threshold.
p90
aVThe universe is tiny; it's smaller than an atom.
p91
aVIt's incredibly hot.
p92
aVIt contains everything that's in today's universe,
p93
aVso you can imagine, it's busting.
p94
aVAnd it's expanding at incredible speed.
p95
aVAnd at first, it's just a blur,
p96
aVbut very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur.
p97
aVWithin the first second,
p98
aVenergy itself shatters into distinct forces
p99
aVincluding electromagnetism and gravity.
p100
aVAnd energy does something else quite magical:
p101
aVit congeals to form matter \u2014
p102
aVquarks that will create protons
p103
aVand leptons that include electrons.
p104
aVAnd all of that happens in the first second.
p105
aa(lp106
VNow we move forward 380,000 years.
p107
aVThat's twice as long as humans have been on this planet.
p108
aVAnd now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium.
p109
aVNow I want to pause for a moment,
p110
aV380,000 years after the origins of the universe,
p111
aVbecause we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage.
p112
aVWe know above all that it was extremely simple.
p113
aVIt consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms,
p114
aVand they have no structure.
p115
aVThey're really a sort of cosmic mush.
p116
aVBut that's not completely true.
p117
aVRecent studies
p118
aVby satellites such as the WMAP satellite
p119
aVhave shown that, in fact,
p120
aVthere are just tiny differences in that background.
p121
aVWhat you see here,
p122
aVthe blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler
p123
aVthan the red areas.
p124
aVThese are tiny differences,
p125
aVbut it was enough for the universe to move on
p126
aVto the next stage of building complexity.
p127
aa(lp128
VAnd this is how it works.
p129
aVGravity is more powerful where there's more stuff.
p130
aVSo where you get slightly denser areas,
p131
aVgravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms.
p132
aVSo we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds.
p133
aVAnd each cloud is compacted,
p134
aVgravity gets more powerful as density increases,
p135
aVthe temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud,
p136
aVand then, at the center,
p137
aVthe temperature crosses the threshold temperature
p138
aVof 10 million degrees,
p139
aVprotons start to fuse,
p140
aVthere's a huge release of energy,
p141
aVand \u2014
p142
aVbam!
p143
aVWe have our first stars.
p144
aVFrom about 200 million years after the Big Bang,
p145
aVstars begin to appear all through the universe,
p146
aVbillions of them.
p147
aVAnd the universe is now significantly more interesting
p148
aVand more complex.
p149
aa(lp150
VStars will create the Goldilocks conditions
p151
aVfor crossing two new thresholds.
p152
aVWhen very large stars die,
p153
aVthey create temperatures so high
p154
aVthat protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations,
p155
aVto form all the elements of the periodic table.
p156
aVIf, like me, you're wearing a gold ring,
p157
aVit was forged in a supernova explosion.
p158
aVSo now the universe is chemically more complex.
p159
aVAnd in a chemically more complex universe,
p160
aVit's possible to make more things.
p161
aVAnd what starts happening is that, around young suns,
p162
aVyoung stars,
p163
aVall these elements combine, they swirl around,
p164
aVthe energy of the star stirs them around,
p165
aVthey form particles, they form snowflakes, they form little dust motes,
p166
aVthey form rocks, they form asteroids,
p167
aVand eventually, they form planets and moons.
p168
aVAnd that is how our solar system was formed,
p169
aVfour and a half billion years ago.
p170
aVRocky planets like our Earth are significantly more complex than stars
p171
aVbecause they contain a much greater diversity of materials.
p172
aVSo we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity.
p173
aa(lp174
VNow, the going gets tougher.
p175
aVThe next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile,
p176
aVsignificantly more vulnerable,
p177
aVbut they're also much more creative
p178
aVand much more capable of generating further complexity.
p179
aVI'm talking, of course, about living organisms.
p180
aVLiving organisms are created by chemistry.
p181
aVWe are huge packages of chemicals.
p182
aVSo, chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force.
p183
aVThat operates over smaller scales than gravity,
p184
aVwhich explains why you and I are smaller than stars or planets.
p185
aVNow, what are the ideal conditions for chemistry?
p186
aVWhat are the Goldilocks conditions?
p187
aVWell, first, you need energy,
p188
aVbut not too much.
p189
aVIn the center of a star, there's so much energy
p190
aVthat any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again.
p191
aVBut not too little.
p192
aVIn intergalactic space,
p193
aVthere's so little energy that atoms can't combine.
p194
aVWhat you want is just the right amount,
p195
aVand planets, it turns out, are just right,
p196
aVbecause they're close to stars, but not too close.
p197
aa(lp198
VYou also need a great diversity of chemical elements,
p199
aVand you need liquids, such as water.
p200
aVWhy?
p201
aVWell, in gases, atoms move past each other so fast
p202
aVthat they can't hitch up.
p203
aVIn solids,
p204
aVatoms are stuck together, they can't move.
p205
aVIn liquids,
p206
aVthey can cruise and cuddle
p207
aVand link up to form molecules.
p208
aVNow, where do you find such Goldilocks conditions?
p209
aVWell, planets are great,
p210
aVand our early Earth was almost perfect.
p211
aVIt was just the right distance from its star
p212
aVto contain huge oceans of liquid water.
p213
aVAnd deep beneath those oceans,
p214
aVat cracks in the Earth's crust,
p215
aVyou've got heat seeping up from inside the Earth,
p216
aVand you've got a great diversity of elements.
p217
aVSo at those deep oceanic vents,
p218
aVfantastic chemistry began to happen,
p219
aVand atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations.
p220
aa(lp221
VBut of course, life is more than just exotic chemistry.
p222
aVHow do you stabilize those huge molecules
p223
aVthat seem to be viable?
p224
aVWell, it's here that life introduces an entirely new trick.
p225
aVYou don't stabilize the individual;
p226
aVyou stabilize the template,
p227
aVthe thing that carries information,
p228
aVand you allow the template to copy itself.
p229
aVAnd DNA, of course, is the beautiful molecule
p230
aVthat contains that information.
p231
aVYou'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA.
p232
aVEach rung contains information.
p233
aVSo, DNA contains information about how to make living organisms.
p234
aVAnd DNA also copies itself.
p235
aVSo, it copies itself
p236
aVand scatters the templates through the ocean.
p237
aVSo the information spreads.
p238
aVNotice that information has become part of our story.
p239
aVThe real beauty of DNA though is in its imperfections.
p240
aVAs it copies itself, once in every billion rungs,
p241
aVthere tends to be an error.
p242
aVAnd what that means is that DNA is, in effect, learning.
p243
aVIt's accumulating new ways of making living organisms
p244
aVbecause some of those errors work.
p245
aVSo DNA's learning
p246
aVand it's building greater diversity and greater complexity.
p247
aVAnd we can see this happening over the last four billion years.
p248
aa(lp249
VFor most of that time of life on Earth,
p250
aVliving organisms have been relatively simple \u2014
p251
aVsingle cells.
p252
aVBut they had great diversity, and, inside, great complexity.
p253
aVThen from about 600 to 800 million years ago,
p254
aVmulti-celled organisms appear.
p255
aVYou get fungi, you get fish,
p256
aVyou get plants,
p257
aVyou get amphibia, you get reptiles,
p258
aVand then, of course, you get the dinosaurs.
p259
aVAnd occasionally, there are disasters.
p260
aVSixty-five million years ago,
p261
aVan asteroid landed on Earth
p262
aVnear the Yucatan Peninsula,
p263
aVcreating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war,
p264
aVand the dinosaurs were wiped out.
p265
aVTerrible news for the dinosaurs,
p266
aVbut great news for our mammalian ancestors,
p267
aVwho flourished
p268
aVin the niches left empty by the dinosaurs.
p269
aVAnd we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse
p270
aVthat began 65 million years ago
p271
aVwith the landing of an asteroid.
p272
aa(lp273
VHumans appeared about 200,000 years ago.
p274
aVAnd I believe we count as a threshold in this great story.
p275
aVLet me explain why.
p276
aVWe've seen that DNA learns in a sense,
p277
aVit accumulates information.
p278
aVBut it is so slow.
p279
aVDNA accumulates information through random errors,
p280
aVsome of which just happen to work.
p281
aVBut DNA had actually generated a faster way of learning:
p282
aVit had produced organisms with brains,
p283
aVand those organisms can learn in real time.
p284
aVThey accumulate information, they learn.
p285
aVThe sad thing is, when they die,
p286
aVthe information dies with them.
p287
aVNow what makes humans different is human language.
p288
aVWe are blessed with a language, a system of communication,
p289
aVso powerful and so precise
p290
aVthat we can share what we've learned with such precision
p291
aVthat it can accumulate in the collective memory.
p292
aVAnd that means
p293
aVit can outlast the individuals who learned that information,
p294
aVand it can accumulate from generation to generation.
p295
aVAnd that's why, as a species, we're so creative and so powerful,
p296
aVand that's why we have a history.
p297
aVWe seem to be the only species in four billion years
p298
aVto have this gift.
p299
aa(lp300
VI call this ability collective learning.
p301
aVIt's what makes us different.
p302
aVWe can see it at work in the earliest stages of human history.
p303
aVWe evolved as a species in the savanna lands of Africa,
p304
aVbut then you see humans migrating into new environments,
p305
aVinto desert lands, into jungles,
p306
aVinto the Ice Age tundra of Siberia \u2014
p307
aVtough, tough environment \u2014
p308
aVinto the Americas, into Australasia.
p309
aVEach migration involved learning \u2014
p310
aVlearning new ways of exploiting the environment,
p311
aVnew ways of dealing with their surroundings.
p312
aa(lp313
VThen 10,000 years ago,
p314
aVexploiting a sudden change in global climate
p315
aVwith the end of the last ice age,
p316
aVhumans learned to farm.
p317
aVFarming was an energy bonanza.
p318
aVAnd exploiting that energy, human populations multiplied.
p319
aVHuman societies got larger, denser, more interconnected.
p320
aVAnd then from about 500 years ago,
p321
aVhumans began to link up globally
p322
aVthrough shipping, through trains,
p323
aVthrough telegraph, through the Internet,
p324
aVuntil now we seem to form a single global brain
p325
aVof almost seven billion individuals.
p326
aVAnd that brain is learning at warp speed.
p327
aVAnd in the last 200 years, something else has happened.
p328
aVWe've stumbled on another energy bonanza
p329
aVin fossil fuels.
p330
aVSo fossil fuels and collective learning together
p331
aVexplain the staggering complexity we see around us.
p332
aa(lp333
VSo \u2014
p334
aVHere we are,
p335
aVback at the convention center.
p336
aVWe've been on a journey, a return journey, of 13.7 billion years.
p337
aVI hope you agree this is a powerful story.
p338
aVAnd it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role.
p339
aVBut it also contains warnings.
p340
aVCollective learning is a very, very powerful force,
p341
aVand it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it.
p342
aVI remember very vividly as a child growing up in England,
p343
aVliving through the Cuban Missile Crisis.
p344
aVFor a few days, the entire biosphere
p345
aVseemed to be on the verge of destruction.
p346
aVAnd the same weapons are still here,
p347
aVand they are still armed.
p348
aVIf we avoid that trap, others are waiting for us.
p349
aVWe're burning fossil fuels at such a rate
p350
aVthat we seem to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions
p351
aVthat made it possible for human civilizations
p352
aVto flourish over the last 10,000 years.
p353
aVSo what big history can do
p354
aVis show us the nature of our complexity and fragility
p355
aVand the dangers that face us,
p356
aVbut it can also show us our power with collective learning.
p357
aa(lp358
VAnd now, finally \u2014
p359
aVthis is what I want.
p360
aVI want my grandson, Daniel,
p361
aVand his friends and his generation,
p362
aVthroughout the world,
p363
aVto know the story of big history,
p364
aVand to know it so well
p365
aVthat they understand both the challenges that face us
p366
aVand the opportunities that face us.
p367
aVAnd that's why a group of us
p368
aVare building a free, online syllabus
p369
aVin big history
p370
aVfor high-school students throughout the world.
p371
aVWe believe that big history
p372
aVwill be a vital intellectual tool for them,
p373
aVas Daniel and his generation
p374
aVface the huge challenges
p375
aVand also the huge opportunities
p376
aVahead of them at this threshold moment
