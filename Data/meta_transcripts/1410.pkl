VHi.
p4
aV(Laughter)
p5
aa(lp6
VI did that for two reasons.
p7
aVFirst of all, I wanted to give you
p8
aVa good visual first impression.
p9
aVBut the main reason I did it is that
p10
aVthat's what happens to me when I'm forced to wear
p11
aVa Lady Gaga skanky mic.
p12
aa(lp13
V(Laughter)
p14
aa(lp15
VI'm used to a stationary mic.
p16
aVIt's the sensible shoe of public address.
p17
aa(lp18
V(Laughter)
p19
aa(lp20
VBut you clamp this thing on my head, and something happens.
p21
aVI just become skanky.
p22
aV(Laughter) So I'm sorry about that.
p23
aVAnd I'm already off-message.
p24
aa(lp25
V(Laughter)
p26
aa(lp27
VLadies and gentlemen,
p28
aVI have devoted the past 25 years of my life
p29
aVto designing books.
p30
aV("Yes, BOOKS. You know, the bound volumes with ink on paper.
p31
aVYou cannot turn them off with a switch.
p32
aVTell your kids.")
p33
aVIt all sort of started as a benign mistake,
p34
aVlike penicillin. (Laughter)
p35
aa(lp36
VWhat I really wanted
p37
aVwas to be a graphic designer
p38
aVat one of the big design firms in New York City.
p39
aVBut upon arrival there,
p40
aVin the fall of 1986, and doing a lot of interviews,
p41
aVI found that the only thing I was offered
p42
aVwas to be Assistant to the Art Director at Alfred A. Knopf,
p43
aVa book publisher.
p44
aVNow I was stupid,
p45
aVbut not so stupid that I turned it down.
p46
aa(lp47
VI had absolutely no idea
p48
aVwhat I was about to become part of,
p49
aVand I was incredibly lucky.
p50
aVSoon, it had occurred to me what my job was.
p51
aVMy job was to ask this question:
p52
aV"What do the stories look like?"
p53
aVBecause that is what Knopf is.
p54
aVIt is the story factory, one of the very best in the world.
p55
aVWe bring stories to the public.
p56
aa(lp57
VThe stories can be anything,
p58
aVand some of them are actually true.
p59
aVBut they all have one thing in common:
p60
aVThey all need to look like something.
p61
aVThey all need a face.
p62
aVWhy? To give you a first impression
p63
aVof what you are about to get into.
p64
aVA book designer gives form to content,
p65
aVbut also
p66
aVmanages a very careful balance between the two.
p67
aa(lp68
VNow, the first day
p69
aVof my graphic design training at Penn State University,
p70
aVthe teacher, Lanny Sommese, came into the room
p71
aVand he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard,
p72
aVand wrote the word "Apple" underneath,
p73
aVand he said, "OK. Lesson one. Listen up."
p74
aVAnd he covered up the picture and he said,
p75
aV"You either say this," and then he covered up the word,
p76
aV"or you show this.
p77
aVBut you don't do this."
p78
aVBecause this is treating your audience like a moron.
p79
aV(Laughter)
p80
aVAnd they deserve better.
p81
aa(lp82
VAnd lo and behold, soon enough,
p83
aVI was able to put this theory to the test
p84
aVon two books that I was working on for Knopf.
p85
aVThe first was Katharine Hepburn's memoirs,
p86
aVand the second was a biography of Marlene Dietrich.
p87
aVNow the Hepburn book
p88
aVwas written in a very conversational style,
p89
aVit was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you.
p90
aVThe Dietrich book was an observation
p91
aVby her daughter; it was a biography.
p92
aVSo the Hepburn story is words
p93
aVand the Dietrich story is pictures, and so we did this.
p94
aVSo there you are.
p95
aVPure content and pure form, side by side.
p96
aVNo fighting, ladies.
p97
aa(lp98
V("What's a Jurassic Park?")
p99
aVNow, what is the story here?
p100
aVSomeone
p101
aVis re-engineering dinosaurs
p102
aVby extracting their DNA
p103
aVfrom prehistoric amber.
p104
aVGenius!
p105
aV(Laughter)
p106
aa(lp107
VNow, luckily for me,
p108
aVI live and work in New York City,
p109
aVwhere there are plenty of dinosaurs.
p110
aV(Laughter)
p111
aVSo,
p112
aVI went to the Museum of Natural History,
p113
aVand I checked out the bones, and I went to the gift shop,
p114
aVand I bought a book.
p115
aVAnd I was particularly taken with this page of the book,
p116
aVand more specifically the lower right-hand corner.
p117
aa(lp118
VNow I took this diagram,
p119
aVand I put it in a Photostat machine,
p120
aV(Laughter)
p121
aVand I took a piece of tracing paper,
p122
aVand I taped it over the Photostat
p123
aVwith a piece of Scotch tape \u2014 stop me if I'm going too fast \u2014
p124
aV(Laughter) \u2014
p125
aVand then I took a Rapidograph pen \u2014
p126
aVexplain it to the youngsters \u2014
p127
aV(Laughter)
p128
aVand I just started to reconstitute the dinosaur.
p129
aa(lp130
VI had no idea what I was doing,
p131
aVI had no idea where I was going,
p132
aVbut at some point, I stopped \u2014
p133
aVwhen to keep going would seem like I was going too far.
p134
aVAnd what I ended up with was a graphic representation
p135
aVof us seeing this animal coming into being.
p136
aVWe're in the middle of the process.
p137
aVAnd then I just threw some typography on it.
p138
aVVery basic stuff,
p139
aVslightly suggestive of public park signage.
p140
aV(Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VEverybody in house loved it,
p143
aVand so off it goes to the author.
p144
aVAnd even back then,
p145
aVMichael was on the cutting edge.
p146
aV("Michael Crichton responds by fax:")
p147
aV("Wow! Fucking Fantastic Jacket")
p148
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p149
aVThat was a relief to see that pour out of the machine.
p150
aV(Laughter)
p151
aVI miss Michael.
p152
aa(lp153
VAnd sure enough, somebody from MCA Universal
p154
aVcalls our legal department to see if they can
p155
aVmaybe look into buying the rights to the image,
p156
aVjust in case they might want to use it.
p157
aVWell, they used it.
p158
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p159
aa(lp160
VAnd I was thrilled.
p161
aVWe all know it was an amazing movie,
p162
aVand it was so interesting to see it
p163
aVgo out into the culture and become this phenomenon
p164
aVand to see all the different permutations of it.
p165
aVBut not too long ago,
p166
aVI came upon this on the Web.
p167
aVNo, that is not me.
p168
aVBut whoever it is,
p169
aVI can't help but thinking they woke up one day like,
p170
aV"Oh my God, that wasn't there last night. Ooooohh!
p171
aVI was so wasted."
p172
aV(Laughter)
p173
aa(lp174
VBut if you think about it, from my head
p175
aVto my hands to his leg.
p176
aV(Laughter)
p177
aVThat's a responsibility.
p178
aVAnd it's a responsibility that I don't take lightly.
p179
aVThe book designer's responsibility is threefold:
p180
aVto the reader, to the publisher and, most of all, to the author.
p181
aVI want you to look at the author's book
p182
aVand say, "Wow! I need to read that."
p183
aa(lp184
VDavid Sedaris is one of my favorite writers,
p185
aVand the title essay
p186
aVin this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony.
p187
aVAnd the reason he went is because
p188
aVhe had a fear of his body image,
p189
aVand he wanted to explore what was underlying that.
p190
aVFor me, it was simply an excuse to design a book
p191
aVthat you could literally take the pants off of.
p192
aVBut when you do,
p193
aVyou don't get what you expect.
p194
aVYou get something that goes much deeper than that.
p195
aVAnd David especially loved this design
p196
aVbecause at book signings, which he does a lot of,
p197
aVhe could take a magic marker and do this.
p198
aV(Laughter)
p199
aVHello!
p200
aV(Laughter)
p201
aa(lp202
VAugusten Burroughs wrote a memoir
p203
aVcalled ["Dry"], and it's about his time in rehab.
p204
aVIn his 20s, he was a hotshot ad executive,
p205
aVand as Mad Men has told us, a raging alcoholic.
p206
aVHe did not think so, however,
p207
aVbut his coworkers did an intervention and they said,
p208
aV"You are going to rehab, or you will be fired and you will die."
p209
aa(lp210
VNow to me, this was always going to be a typographic solution,
p211
aVwhat I would call the opposite of Type 101.
p212
aVWhat does that mean?
p213
aVUsually on the first day of Introduction to Typography,
p214
aVyou get the assignment of, select a word
p215
aVand make it look like what it says it is. So that's Type 101, right?
p216
aVVery simple stuff.
p217
aVThis is going to be the opposite of that.
p218
aVI want this book to look like it's lying to you,
p219
aVdesperately and hopelessly, the way an alcoholic would.
p220
aa(lp221
VThe answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine.
p222
aVI set up the type, I printed it out on an Epson printer
p223
aVwith water-soluble ink, taped it to the wall
p224
aVand threw a bucket of water at it. Presto!
p225
aVThen when we went to press,
p226
aVthe printer put a spot gloss on the ink
p227
aVand it really looked like it was running.
p228
aa(lp229
VNot long after it came out, Augusten was waylaid in an airport
p230
aVand he was hiding out in the bookstore
p231
aVspying on who was buying his books.
p232
aVAnd this woman came up to it,
p233
aVand she squinted, and she took it to the register,
p234
aVand she said to the man behind the counter, "This one's ruined."
p235
aV(Laughter)
p236
aVAnd the guy behind the counter said, "I know, lady. They all came in that way."
p237
aV(Laughter)
p238
aVNow, that's a good printing job.
p239
aa(lp240
VA book cover
p241
aVis a distillation.
p242
aVIt is a haiku,
p243
aVif you will, of the story.
p244
aVThis particular story
p245
aVby Osama Tezuka
p246
aVis his epic life of the Buddha,
p247
aVand it's eight volumes in all. But the best thing is
p248
aVwhen it's on your shelf, you get a shelf life
p249
aVof the Buddha, moving from one age to the next.
p250
aVAll of these solutions
p251
aVderive their origins from the text of the book,
p252
aVbut once the book designer has read the text,
p253
aVthen he has to be an interpreter
p254
aVand a translator.
p255
aa(lp256
VThis story was a real puzzle.
p257
aVThis is what it's about.
p258
aV("Intrigue and murder among 16th century Ottoman court painters.")
p259
aa(lp260
V(Laughter)
p261
aa(lp262
VAll right, so I got a collection of the paintings together
p263
aVand I looked at them and I deconstructed them
p264
aVand I put them back together.
p265
aVAnd so, here's the design, right?
p266
aVAnd so here's the front and the spine, and it's flat.
p267
aVBut the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf.
p268
aa(lp269
VAhh! We come upon them,
p270
aVthe clandestine lovers. Let's draw them out.
p271
aVHuhh! They've been discovered by the sultan.
p272
aVHe will not be pleased.
p273
aVHuhh! And now the sultan is in danger.
p274
aVAnd now, we have to open it up
p275
aVto find out what's going to happen next.
p276
aVTry experiencing that on a Kindle.
p277
aV(Laughter)
p278
aa(lp279
VDon't get me started.
p280
aVSeriously.
p281
aVMuch is to be gained by eBooks:
p282
aVease, convenience, portability.
p283
aVBut something is definitely lost: tradition,
p284
aVa sensual experience, the comfort of thingy-ness \u2014
p285
aVa little bit of humanity.
p286
aa(lp287
VDo you know what John Updike used to do
p288
aVthe first thing when he would get a copy
p289
aVof one of his new books from Alfred A. Knopf?
p290
aVHe'd smell it.
p291
aVThen he'd run his hand over the rag paper,
p292
aVand the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages.
p293
aVAll those years, all those books, he never got tired of it.
p294
aVNow, I am all for the iPad,
p295
aVbut trust me \u2014 smelling it will get you nowhere.
p296
aV(Laughter)
p297
aVNow the Apple guys are texting,
p298
aV"Develop odor emission plug-in."
p299
aV(Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
VAnd the last story I'm going to talk about is quite a story.
p302
aVA woman
p303
aVnamed Aomame in 1984 Japan finds herself
p304
aVnegotiating down a spiral staircase
p305
aVoff an elevated highway. When she gets to the bottom,
p306
aVshe can't help but feel that, all of a sudden,
p307
aVshe's entered a new reality
p308
aVthat's just slightly different from the one that she left,
p309
aVbut very similar, but different.
p310
aVAnd so, we're talking about parallel planes of existence,
p311
aVsort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers.
p312
aa(lp313
VSo how do we show this?
p314
aVWe go back to Hepburn and Dietrich, but now we merge them.
p315
aVSo we're talking about different planes, different pieces of paper.
p316
aVSo this is on a semi-transparent piece of velum.
p317
aVIt's one part of the form and content.
p318
aVWhen it's on top of the paper board,
p319
aVwhich is the opposite, it forms this.
p320
aVSo even if you don't know anything about this book,
p321
aVyou are forced to consider a single person
p322
aVstraddling two planes of existence.
p323
aVAnd the object itself invited exploration
p324
aVinteraction, consideration
p325
aVand touch.
p326
aa(lp327
VThis debuted at number two
p328
aVon the New York Times Best Seller list.
p329
aVThis is unheard of,
p330
aVboth for us the publisher, and the author.
p331
aVWe're talking a 900-page book
p332
aVthat is as weird as it is compelling,
p333
aVand featuring a climactic scene
p334
aVin which a horde of tiny people
p335
aVemerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl
p336
aVand cause a German Shepherd to explode.
p337
aV(Laughter)
p338
aVNot exactly Jackie Collins.
p339
aVFourteen weeks on the Best Seller list,
p340
aVeight printings, and still going strong.
p341
aa(lp342
VSo even though we love publishing as an art,
p343
aVwe very much know it's a business too,
p344
aVand that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky,
p345
aVthat great art can be great business.
p346
aa(lp347
VSo that's my story. To be continued.
p348
aVWhat does it look like?
p349
aVYes. It can, it does and it will,
p350
aVbut for this book designer,
p351
aVpage-turner,
p352
aVdog-eared place-holder,
p353
aVnotes in the margins-taker,
p354
aVink-sniffer,
p355
aVthe story looks like this.
p356
aa(lp357
