VSo I'm going to tell you a little bit
p4
aVabout reimagining food.
p5
aVI've been interested in food for a long time.
p6
aVI taught myself to cook
p7
aVwith a bunch of big books like this.
p8
aVI went to chef school in France.
p9
aVAnd there is a way
p10
aVthe world both envisions food,
p11
aVthe way the world writes about food and learns about food.
p12
aVAnd it's largely what you would find in these books.
p13
aVAnd it's a wonderful thing.
p14
aVBut there's some things that have been going on
p15
aVsince this idea of food was established.
p16
aa(lp17
VIn the last 20 years,
p18
aVpeople have realized that science
p19
aVhas a tremendous amount to do with food.
p20
aVIn fact, understanding why cooking works
p21
aVrequires knowing the science of cooking \u2014
p22
aVsome of the chemistry, some of the physics and so forth.
p23
aVBut that's not in any of those books.
p24
aVThere's also a tremendous number of techniques
p25
aVthat chefs have developed,
p26
aVsome about new aesthetics, new approaches to food.
p27
aVThere's a chef in Spain named Ferran Adria.
p28
aVHe's developed a very avant-garde cuisine.
p29
aVA guy in England called Heston Blumenthal,
p30
aVhe's developed his avant-garde cuisine.
p31
aVNone of the techniques that these people have developed
p32
aVover the course of the last 20 years
p33
aVis in any of those books.
p34
aVNone of them are taught in cooking schools.
p35
aVIn order to learn them, you have to go work in those restaurants.
p36
aVAnd finally,
p37
aVthere's the old way of viewing food
p38
aVis the old way.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd so a few years ago \u2014 fours years ago, actually \u2014
p41
aVI set out to say, is there a way
p42
aVwe can communicate science and technique and wonder?
p43
aVIs there a way we can show people food
p44
aVin a way they have not seen it before?
p45
aVSo we tried, and I'll show you what we came up with.
p46
aVThis is a picture called a cutaway.
p47
aVThis is actually the first picture I took in the book.
p48
aVThe idea here is to explain what happens
p49
aVwhen you steam broccoli.
p50
aVAnd this magic view allows you to see
p51
aVall of what's happening
p52
aVwhile the broccoli steams.
p53
aVThen each of the different little pieces around it
p54
aVexplain some fact.
p55
aa(lp56
VAnd the hope was two-fold.
p57
aVOne is you can actually explain what happens when you steam broccoli.
p58
aVBut the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people
p59
aVinto stuff that was a little more technical,
p60
aVmaybe a little bit more scientific, maybe a little bit more chef-y
p61
aVthan they otherwise would have.
p62
aVBecause with that beautiful photo,
p63
aVmaybe I can also package this little box here
p64
aVthat talks about how steaming and boiling
p65
aVactually take different amounts of time.
p66
aVSteaming ought to be faster.
p67
aVIt turns out it isn't because of something called film condensation,
p68
aVand this explains that.
p69
aa(lp70
VWell, that first cutaway picture worked,
p71
aVso we said, "Okay, let's do some more."
p72
aVSo here's another one.
p73
aVWe discovered why woks are the shape they are.
p74
aVThis shaped wok doesn't work very well;
p75
aVthis caught fire three times.
p76
aVBut we had a philosophy,
p77
aVwhich is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second.
p78
aa(lp79
V(Laughter)
p80
aa(lp81
VAnd one of our canning cutaways.
p82
aVOnce you start cutting things in half, you kind of get carried away,
p83
aVso you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan.
p84
aVAnd each of these text blocks
p85
aVexplains a key thing that's going on.
p86
aVIn this case, boiling water canning
p87
aVis for canning things that are already pretty acidic.
p88
aVYou don't have to heat them up as hot
p89
aVas you would something you do pressure canning
p90
aVbecause bacterial spores can't grow in the acid.
p91
aVSo this is great for pickled vegetables,
p92
aVwhich is what we're canning here.
p93
aa(lp94
VHere's our hamburger cutaway.
p95
aVOne of our philosophies in the book
p96
aVis that no dish
p97
aVis really intrinsically any better than any other dish.
p98
aVSo you can lavish
p99
aVall the same care, all the same technique,
p100
aVon a hamburger
p101
aVas you would on some much more fancy dish.
p102
aVAnd if you do lavish as much technique as possible,
p103
aVand you try to make the highest quality hamburger,
p104
aVit gets to be a little bit involved.
p105
aVThe New York Times ran a piece
p106
aVafter my book was delayed
p107
aVand it was called "The Wait for the 30-Hour Hamburger
p108
aVJust Got Longer."
p109
aVBecause our hamburger recipe, our ultimate hamburger recipe,
p110
aVif you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff,
p111
aVit does take about 30 hours.
p112
aVOf course, you're not actually working the whole time.
p113
aVMost of the time is kind of sitting there.
p114
aa(lp115
VThe point of this cutaway
p116
aVis to show people a view of hamburgers they haven't seen before
p117
aVand to explain the physics of hamburgers
p118
aVand the chemistry of hamburgers,
p119
aVbecause, believe it or not, there is something to the physics and chemistry \u2014
p120
aVin particular, those flames underneath the burger.
p121
aVMost of the characteristic char-grilled taste
p122
aVdoesn't come from the wood or the charcoal.
p123
aVBuying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference.
p124
aVMostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing, or burning.
p125
aVSo it's the fat that drips down and flares up
p126
aVthat causes the characteristic taste.
p127
aa(lp128
VNow you might wonder, how do we make these cutaways?
p129
aVMost people assume we use Photoshop.
p130
aVAnd the answer is: no, not really;
p131
aVwe use a machine shop.
p132
aVAnd it turns out, the best way to cut things in half
p133
aVis to actually cut them in half.
p134
aVSo we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world.
p135
aV(Laughter)
p136
aVWe cut a $5,000 restaurant oven in half.
p137
aVThe manufacturer said,
p138
aV"What would it take for you to cut one in half?"
p139
aVI said, "It would have to show up free."
p140
aVAnd so it showed up, we used it a little while,
p141
aVwe cut it in half.
p142
aa(lp143
VNow you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots.
p144
aVWe would glue a piece of Pyrex
p145
aVor heat-resistant glass in front.
p146
aVWe used a red, very high-temperature silicon to do that.
p147
aVThe great thing is, when you cut something in half,
p148
aVyou have another half.
p149
aVSo you photograph that in exactly the same position,
p150
aVand then you can substitute in \u2014
p151
aVand that part does use Photoshop \u2014 just the edges.
p152
aVSo it's very much like in a Hollywood movie
p153
aVwhere a guy flies through the air, supported by wires,
p154
aVand then they take the wires away digitally
p155
aVso you're flying through the air.
p156
aa(lp157
VIn most cases, though, there was no glass.
p158
aVLike for the hamburger, we just cut the damn barbecue.
p159
aVAnd so those coals that kept falling off the edge,
p160
aVwe kept having to put them back up.
p161
aVBut again, it only has to work for a thousandth of a second.
p162
aVThe wok shot caught fire three times.
p163
aVWhat happens when you have your wok cut in half
p164
aVis the oil goes down into the fire
p165
aVand whoosh!
p166
aVOne of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way.
p167
aVBut hey, they grow back.
p168
aa(lp169
VIn addition to cutaways,
p170
aVwe also explain physics.
p171
aVThis is Fourier's law of heat conduction.
p172
aVIt's a partial differential equation.
p173
aVWe have the only cookbook in the world
p174
aVthat has partial differential equations in it.
p175
aVBut to make them palatable,
p176
aVwe cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire
p177
aVand photographed it like this.
p178
aVWe've got lots of little tidbits in the book.
p179
aVEverybody knows that your various appliances
p180
aVhave wattage, right?
p181
aVBut you probably don't know that much about James Watt.
p182
aVBut now you will; we put a biography of James Watt in.
p183
aVIt's a little couple paragraphs
p184
aVto explain why we call that unit of heat the watt,
p185
aVand where he got his inspiration.
p186
aVIt turned out he was hired by a Scottish distillery
p187
aVto understand why they were burning so damn much peat
p188
aVto distill the whiskey.
p189
aa(lp190
VWe also did a lot of calculation.
p191
aVI personally wrote thousands of lines of code
p192
aVto write this cookbook.
p193
aVHere's a calculation
p194
aVthat shows how the intensity of a barbecue,
p195
aVor other radiant heat source, goes
p196
aVas you move away from it.
p197
aVSo as you move vertically away from this surface,
p198
aVthe heat falls off.
p199
aVAs you move side to side, it moves off.
p200
aVThat horn-shaped region
p201
aVis what we call the sweet spot.
p202
aVThat's the place where the heat is even to within 10 percent.
p203
aVSo that's the place where you really want to cook.
p204
aVAnd it's got this funny horn-shaped thing,
p205
aVwhich as far as I know, again,
p206
aVthe first cookbook to ever do this.
p207
aVNow it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it.
p208
aVYou know, there's two ways
p209
aVyou can make a product.
p210
aVYou can do lots of market research
p211
aVand do focus groups
p212
aVand figure out what people really want,
p213
aVor you can just kind of go for it
p214
aVand make the book you want and hope other people like it.
p215
aa(lp216
VHere's a step-by-step that shows grinding hamburger.
p217
aVIf you really want great hamburger,
p218
aVit turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain.
p219
aVAnd it's really simple, as you can see here.
p220
aVAs it comes out of the grinder, you just have a little tray,
p221
aVand you just take it off in little passes,
p222
aVbuild it up, slice it vertically.
p223
aVHere's the final hamburger.
p224
aVThis is the 30-hour hamburger.
p225
aVWe make every aspect of this burger.
p226
aVThe lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it.
p227
aVWe also have things about how to make the bun.
p228
aVThere's a mushroom, ketchup \u2014 it goes on and on.
p229
aa(lp230
VNow watch closely. This is popcorn. I'll explain it here.
p231
aVThe popcorn is illustrating
p232
aVa key thing in physics.
p233
aVIsn't that beautiful?
p234
aVWe have a very high-speed camera,
p235
aVwhich we had lots of fun with on the book.
p236
aVThe key physics principle here
p237
aVis when water boils to steam
p238
aVit expands by a factor of 1,600.
p239
aVThat's what's happening to the water inside that popcorn.
p240
aVSo it's a great illustration of that.
p241
aa(lp242
VNow I'm going to close with a video that is kind of unusual.
p243
aVWe have a chapter on gels.
p244
aVAnd because people watch Mythbusters and CSI,
p245
aVI thought, well, let's put in a recipe
p246
aVfor a ballistics gelatin.
p247
aVWell, if you have a high-speed camera,
p248
aVand you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around,
p249
aVpretty soon somebody does this.
p250
aV(Gasps)
p251
aVNow the amazing thing here
p252
aVis that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic
p253
aVwhat happens to human flesh when you get shot \u2014 that's why you shouldn't get shot.
p254
aVThe other amazing thing is, when this ballistics gelatin comes down,
p255
aVit falls back down as a nice block.
p256
aa(lp257
VAnyway, here's the book.
p258
aVHere it is.
p259
aV2,438 pages.
p260
aVAnd they're nice big pages too.
p261
aV(Applause)
p262
aVA friend of mine complained
p263
aVthat this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen,
p264
aVso there's a sixth volume
p265
aVthat has washable, waterproof paper.
