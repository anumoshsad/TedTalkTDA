VHey guys.
p4
aVIt's funny, someone just mentioned MacGyver,
p5
aVbecause that was, like, I loved it,
p6
aVand when I was seven, I taped a fork to a drill
p7
aVand I was like, "Hey, Mom, I'm going to Olive Garden."
p8
aVAnd \u2014 (Drilling noise) (Laughter)
p9
aVAnd it worked really well there.
p10
aVAnd you know, it had a profound effect on me.
p11
aVIt sounds silly, but I thought, okay,
p12
aVthe way the world works can be changed,
p13
aVand it can be changed by me in these small ways.
p14
aVAnd my relationship to
p15
aVespecially human-made objects
p16
aVwhich someone else said they work like this,
p17
aVwell, I can say they work a different way, a little bit.
p18
aa(lp19
VAnd so, about 20 years later,
p20
aVI didn't realize the full effect of this,
p21
aVbut I went to Costa Rica
p22
aVand I stayed with these Guaymí natives there,
p23
aVand they could pull leaves off of trees and make shingles out of them,
p24
aVand they could make beds out of trees,
p25
aVand they could \u2014 I watched this woman for three days.
p26
aVI was there. She was peeling this palm frond apart,
p27
aVthese little threads off of it, and she'd roll the threads together
p28
aVand make little thicker threads, like strings,
p29
aVand she would weave the strings together,
p30
aVand as the materiality of this exact very bag
p31
aVformed before my eyes over those three days,
p32
aVthe materiality of the way the world works,
p33
aVof reality, kind of started to unravel in my mind,
p34
aVbecause I realized that this bag and these clothes
p35
aVand the trampoline you have at home and the pencil sharpener,
p36
aVeverything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock
p37
aVor something we dug out of the ground and did some process to,
p38
aVmaybe a more complicated one, but still, everything was made that way.
p39
aa(lp40
VAnd so I had to start studying,
p41
aVwho is it that's making these decisions?
p42
aVWho's making these things? How did they make them?
p43
aVWhat stops us from making them?
p44
aVBecause this is how reality is created.
p45
aVSo I started right away. I was at MIT Media Lab,
p46
aVand I was studying the maker movement
p47
aVand makers and creativity.
p48
aVAnd I started in nature, because I saw these Guaymís
p49
aVdoing it in nature, and there just seems to be less barriers.
p50
aa(lp51
VSo I went to Vermont to Not Back to School Camp,
p52
aVwhere there's unschoolers who are just kind of hanging out
p53
aVand willing to try anything.
p54
aVSo I said, "Let's go into the woods near this stream
p55
aVand just put stuff together, you know, make something,
p56
aVI don't care, geometrical shapes, just grab some junk from around you.
p57
aVWe won't bring anything with us.
p58
aVAnd, like, within minutes, this is very easy for adults
p59
aVand teens to do.
p60
aVHere's a triangle that was being formed underneath a flowing stream,
p61
aVand the shape of an oak leaf being made
p62
aVby other small oak leaves being put together.
p63
aVA leaf tied to a stick with a blade of grass.
p64
aVThe materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom
p65
aVbeing explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it.
p66
aVAnd after about 45 minutes, you get really intricate projects
p67
aVlike leaves sorted by hue, so you get a color fade
p68
aVand put in a circle like a wreath.
p69
aa(lp70
VAnd the creator of this, he said,
p71
aV"This is fire. I call this fire."
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd someone asked him, "How do you get those sticks
p74
aVto stay on that tree?"
p75
aa(lp76
VAnd he's like, "I don't know, but I can show you."
p77
aa(lp78
VAnd I'm like, "Wow, that's really amazing.
p79
aVHe doesn't know, but he can show you."
p80
aVSo his hands know and his intuition knows,
p81
aVbut sometimes what we know gets in the way
p82
aVof what could be, especially
p83
aVwhen it comes to the human-made, human-built world.
p84
aVWe think we already know how something works,
p85
aVso we can't imagine how it could work.
p86
aVWe know how it's supposed to work,
p87
aVso we can't suppose all the things that could be possible.
p88
aa(lp89
VSo kids don't have as hard of a time with this,
p90
aVand I saw in my own son, I gave him this book.
p91
aVI'm a good hippie dad, so I'm like,
p92
aV"Okay, you're going to learn to love the moon.
p93
aVI'm going to give you some building blocks
p94
aVand they're nonrectilinear cactus building blocks,
p95
aVso it's totally legit."
p96
aVBut he doesn't really know what to do with these.
p97
aVI didn't show him.
p98
aVAnd so he's like, "Okay, I'll just mess around with this."
p99
aVThis is no different than the sticks are to the teens in the forest.
p100
aVJust going to try to put them in shapes
p101
aVand push on them and stuff.
p102
aVAnd before long, he's kind of got this mechanism
p103
aVwhere you can almost launch and catapult objects around,
p104
aVand he enlists us in helping him.
p105
aa(lp106
VAnd at this point, I'm starting to wonder,
p107
aVwhat kind of tools can we give people,
p108
aVespecially adults, who know too much,
p109
aVso that they can see the world as malleable,
p110
aVso they see themselves as agents of change
p111
aVin their everyday lives.
p112
aVBecause the most advanced scientists are really
p113
aVjust kind of pushing the way the world itself works,
p114
aVpushing what matter can do,
p115
aVthe most advanced artists are just pushing the medium,
p116
aVand any sufficiently complicated task,
p117
aVwhether you're a cook or a carpenter or you're raising a child \u2014
p118
aVanything that's complicated \u2014
p119
aVcomes up with problems that aren't solved in the middle of it,
p120
aVand you can't do a good job getting it done unless you can say,
p121
aV"Okay, well we're just going to have to refigure this.
p122
aVI don't care that pencils are supposed to be for writing.
p123
aVI'm going to use them a different way."
p124
aa(lp125
VSo let me show you a little demo.
p126
aVThis is a little piano circuit right in here,
p127
aVand this is an ordinary paintbrush
p128
aVthat I smashed it together with. (Beeping)
p129
aVAnd so, with some ketchup,
p130
aV\u2014 (musical notes) \u2014
p131
aVand then I can kind of
p132
aV\u2014 (musical notes) \u2014
p133
aV(Laughter) (Applause)
p134
aa(lp135
VAnd that's awesome, right?
p136
aVBut this is not what's awesome.
p137
aVWhat's awesome is what happens
p138
aVwhen you give the piano circuit to people.
p139
aVA pencil is not just a pencil.
p140
aVLook what it has in the middle of it.
p141
aVThat's a wire running down the middle,
p142
aVand not only is it a wire,
p143
aVif you take that piano circuit, you can thumbtack
p144
aVinto the middle of a pencil,
p145
aVand you can lay out wire on the page, too,
p146
aVand get electrical current to run through it.
p147
aVAnd so you can kind of hack a pencil,
p148
aVjust by thumbtacking into it with a little piano electrical circuit.
p149
aa(lp150
VAnd the electricity runs through your body too.
p151
aVAnd then you can take the little piano circuit off the pencil.
p152
aVYou can make one of these brushes just on the fly.
p153
aVAll you do is connect to the bristles,
p154
aVand the bristles are wet, so they conduct,
p155
aVand the person's body conducts,
p156
aVand leather is great to paint on,
p157
aVand then you can start hooking to everything,
p158
aVeven the kitchen sink.
p159
aVThe metal in the sink is conductive.
p160
aVFlowing water acts like a theremin or a violin.
p161
aa(lp162
V(Musical notes)
p163
aa(lp164
VAnd you can even hook to the trees.
p165
aVAnything in the world is either conductive or not conductive,
p166
aVand you can use those together.
p167
aa(lp168
VSo \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p169
aVI took this to those same teens, because those teens are
p170
aVreally awesome, and they'll try things that I won't try.
p171
aVI don't even have access to a facial piercing if I wanted to.
p172
aVAnd this young woman, she made what she called a hula-looper,
p173
aVand as the hula hoop traveled around her body,
p174
aVshe has a circuit taped to her shirt right there.
p175
aVYou can see her pointing to it in the picture.
p176
aVAnd every time the hula hoop would smush against her body,
p177
aVit would connect two little pieces of copper tape,
p178
aVand it would make a sound, and the next sound,
p179
aVand it would loop the same sounds over and over again.
p180
aa(lp181
VI ran these workshops everywhere.
p182
aVIn Taiwan, at an art museum, this 12-year-old girl
p183
aVmade a mushroom organ out of some mushrooms that were from Taiwan
p184
aVand some electrical tape and hot glue.
p185
aVAnd professional designers were making artifacts
p186
aVwith this thing strapped onto it.
p187
aVAnd big companies like Intel
p188
aVor smaller design firms like Ideo or startups like Bump,
p189
aVwere inviting me to give workshops,
p190
aVjust to practice this idea of smashing electronics
p191
aVand everyday objects together.
p192
aVAnd then we came up with this idea
p193
aVto not just use electronics,
p194
aVbut let's just smash computers with everyday objects
p195
aVand see how that goes over.
p196
aa(lp197
VAnd so I just want to do a quick demo.
p198
aVSo this is the MaKey MaKey circuit,
p199
aVand I'm just going to set it up from the beginning in front of you.
p200
aVSo I'll just plug it in, and now it's on by USB.
p201
aVAnd I'll just hook up the forward arrow.
p202
aVYou guys are facing that way, so I'll hook it to this one.
p203
aVAnd I'll just hook up a little ground wire to it.
p204
aVAnd now, if I touch this piece of pizza,
p205
aVthe slides that I showed you before should go forward.
p206
aVAnd now if I hook up this wire just by connecting it
p207
aVto the left arrow, I'm kind of programming it by where I hook it up,
p208
aVnow I have a left arrow and a right arrow,
p209
aVso I should be able to go forwards and backwards
p210
aVand forwards and backwards. Awesome.
p211
aa(lp212
VAnd so we're like, "We gotta put a video out about this."
p213
aVBecause no one really believed that this was important
p214
aVor meaningful except me and, like, one other guy.
p215
aa(lp216
VSo we made a video to prove that
p217
aVthere's lots of stuff you can do.
p218
aVYou can kind of sketch with Play-Doh
p219
aVand just Google for game controllers.
p220
aVJust ordinary Play-Doh, nothing special.
p221
aVAnd you can literally draw joysticks
p222
aVand just find Pacman on your computer and then just hook it up. (Video game noises)
p223
aVAnd you know the little plastic drawers you can get at Target?
p224
aVWell, if you take those out, they hold water great,
p225
aVbut you can totally cut your toes,
p226
aVso yeah, just be careful.
p227
aa(lp228
VYou know the Happiness Project, where the experts
p229
aVare setting up the piano stairs, and how cool that is?
p230
aVWell, I think it's cool,
p231
aVbut we should be doing that stuff ourselves.
p232
aVIt shouldn't be a set of experts engineering the way the world works.
p233
aVWe should all be participating
p234
aVin changing the way the world works together.
p235
aa(lp236
VAluminum foil. Everybody has a cat.
p237
aVGet a bowl of water. This is just Photo Booth on your Mac OS.
p238
aVHover the mouse over the "take a photo" button,
p239
aVand you've got a little cat photo booth.
p240
aa(lp241
VAnd so we needed hundreds of people to buy this.
p242
aVIf hundreds of people didn't buy this, we couldn't put it on the market.
p243
aVAnd so we put it up on Kickstarter,
p244
aVand hundreds of people bought it in the first day.
p245
aVAnd then 30 days later,
p246
aV11,000 people had backed the project.
p247
aa(lp248
VAnd then what the best part is, we started getting
p249
aVa flood of videos in of people doing crazy things with it.
p250
aVSo this is "The Star-Spangled Banner" by eating lunch,
p251
aVincluding drinking Listerine.
p252
aVAnd we actually sent this guy materials.
p253
aVWe're like, "We're sponsoring you, man.
p254
aVYou're, like, a pro maker."
p255
aa(lp256
VOkay, just wait for this one. This is good.
p257
aa(lp258
V(Laughter)
p259
aV(Applause)
p260
aa(lp261
VAnd these guys at the exploratorium are
p262
aVplaying house plants as if they were drums.
p263
aVAnd dads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways.
p264
aa(lp265
VAnd then this brother \u2014 look at this diagram.
p266
aVSee where it says "sister"?
p267
aVI love when people put humans on the diagram.
p268
aVI always add humans to any technical \u2014
p269
aVif you're drawing a technical diagram, put a human in it.
p270
aVAnd this kid is so sweet. He made this trampoline slideshow advancer for his sister
p271
aVso that on her birthday, she could be the star of the show,
p272
aVjumping on the trampoline to advance the slides.
p273
aVAnd this guy rounded up his dogs and he made a dog piano.
p274
aa(lp275
VAnd this is fun,
p276
aVand what could be more useful than feeling alive and fun?
p277
aVBut it's also very serious because
p278
aVall this accessibility stuff started coming up,
p279
aVwhere people can't use computers, necessarily.
p280
aVLike this dad who wrote us, his son has cerebral palsy
p281
aVand he can't use a normal keyboard.
p282
aVAnd so his dad couldn't necessarily afford
p283
aVto buy all these custom controllers.
p284
aVAnd so, with the MaKey MaKey, he planned to make
p285
aVthese gloves to allow him to navigate the web.
p286
aVAnd a huge eruption of discussion
p287
aVaround accessibility came, and we're really excited about that.
p288
aVWe didn't plan for that at all.
p289
aa(lp290
VAnd then all these professional musicians started using it,
p291
aVlike at Coachella, just this weekend
p292
aVJurassic 5 was using this onstage,
p293
aVand this D.J. is just from Brooklyn, right around here,
p294
aVand he put this up last month.
p295
aVAnd I love the carrot on the turntable.
p296
aa(lp297
V(Music: Massive Attack \u2014 "Teardrop")
p298
aa(lp299
VMost people cannot play them that way. (Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
VAnd when this started to get serious,
p302
aVI thought, I'd better put a really serious warning label on the box that this comes in,
p303
aVbecause otherwise people are going to be getting this
p304
aVand they're going to be turning into agents of creative change,
p305
aVand governments will be crumbling,
p306
aVand I wouldn't have told people, so I thought I'd better warn them.
p307
aVAnd I also put this little surprise. When you open the lid
p308
aVof the box, it says, "The world is a construction kit."
p309
aa(lp310
VAnd as you start to mess around this way,
p311
aVI think that, in some small ways, you do start to see
p312
aVthe landscape of your everyday life
p313
aVa little bit more like something you could express yourself with,
p314
aVand a little bit more like you could participate
p315
aVin designing the future of the way the world works.
p316
aa(lp317
VAnd so next time you're on an escalator
p318
aVand you drop an M&M by accident,
p319
aVyou know, maybe that's an M&M surfboard, not an escalator,
p320
aVso don't pick it up right away.
p321
aVMaybe take some more stuff out of your pockets
p322
aVand throw it down, and maybe some chapstick, whatever.
p323
aa(lp324
VI used to want to design a utopian society
p325
aVor a perfect world or something like that.
p326
aVBut as I'm kind of getting older
p327
aVand kind of messing with all this stuff,
p328
aVI'm realizing that my idea of a perfect world
p329
aVreally can't be designed by one person
p330
aVor even by a million experts.
p331
aVIt's really going to be seven billion pairs of hands,
p332
aVeach following their own passions,
p333
aVand each kind of like a mosaic coming up
p334
aVand creating this world in their backyards
p335
aVand in their kitchens.
p336
aVAnd that's the world I really want to live in.
p337
aa(lp338
VThank you.
