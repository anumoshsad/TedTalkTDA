VOne of my favorite words in the whole of the Oxford English Dictionary
p4
aVis "snollygoster,"
p5
aVjust because it sounds so good.
p6
aVAnd what snollygoster means is "a dishonest politician."
p7
aVAlthough there was a 19th-century newspaper editor
p8
aVwho defined it rather better when he said,
p9
aV"A snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office
p10
aVregardless of party, platform or principle,
p11
aVand who, when he wins,
p12
aVgets there by the sheer force of monumental talknophical assumnancy."
p13
aa(lp14
V(Laughter)
p15
aa(lp16
VNow, I have no idea what "talknophical" is.
p17
aVSomething to do with words, I assume.
p18
aVBut it's very important that words are at the center of politics,
p19
aVand all politicians know they have to try and control language.
p20
aa(lp21
VIt wasn't until, for example, 1771
p22
aVthat the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report
p23
aVthe exact words that were said in the debating chamber.
p24
aVAnd this was actually all down to the bravery
p25
aVof a guy with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby,
p26
aVwho took on Parliament.
p27
aVAnd he was thrown into the Tower of London
p28
aVand imprisoned,
p29
aVbut he was brave enough,
p30
aVhe was brave enough to take them on, and in the end,
p31
aVhe had such popular support in London that he won.
p32
aVAnd it was only a few years later
p33
aVthat we have the first recorded use of the phrase "as bold as brass."
p34
aVMost people think that's down to the metal.
p35
aVIt's not; it's down to a campaigner for the freedom of the press.
p36
aa(lp37
VBut to really show you how words and politics interact,
p38
aVI want to take you back to the United States of America,
p39
aVjust after they'd achieved independence.
p40
aVAnd they had to face the question
p41
aVof what to call George Washington, their leader.
p42
aVThey didn't know.
p43
aVWhat do you call the leader of a republican country?
p44
aa(lp45
VAnd this was debated in Congress for ages and ages.
p46
aVAnd there were all sorts of suggestions on the table,
p47
aVwhich might have made it.
p48
aVI mean, some people wanted him to be called
p49
aV"Chief Magistrate Washington,"
p50
aVand other people, "His Highness, George Washington,"
p51
aVand other people,
p52
aV"Protector of the Liberties
p53
aVof the People of the United States of America Washington."
p54
aVNot that catchy.
p55
aVSome people just wanted to call him king \u2014
p56
aVit was tried and tested.
p57
aVThey weren't even being monarchical,
p58
aVthey had the idea that you could be elected king for a fixed term.
p59
aVAnd, you know, it could have worked.
p60
aa(lp61
VAnd everybody got insanely bored,
p62
aVbecause this debate went on for three weeks.
p63
aVI read a diary of this poor senator who just keeps coming back,
p64
aV"Still on this subject."
p65
aVAnd the reason for the delay and the boredom
p66
aVwas that the House of Representatives were against the Senate.
p67
aVThe House of Representatives didn't want Washington to get drunk on power.
p68
aVThey didn't want to call him "king," in case that gave him ideas,
p69
aVor his successor ideas.
p70
aa(lp71
VSo they wanted to give him the humblest, meagerest,
p72
aVmost pathetic title that they could think of.
p73
aVAnd that title ...
p74
aVwas "President."
p75
aa(lp76
V(Laughter)
p77
aa(lp78
V"President." They didn't invent the title.
p79
aVI mean, it existed before,
p80
aVbut it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting.
p81
aVIt was like the foreman of the jury.
p82
aVAnd it didn't have much more grandeur
p83
aVthan the term "foreman" or "overseer."
p84
aVThere were occasional presidents of little colonial councils
p85
aVand bits of government,
p86
aVbut it was really a nothing title.
p87
aa(lp88
VAnd that's why the Senate objected to it.
p89
aVThey said, "That's ridiculous! You can't call him 'President.'
p90
aVThis guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries.
p91
aVWho's going to take him seriously if he's got a silly little title
p92
aVlike 'President of the United States of America'?"
p93
aa(lp94
V(Laughter)
p95
aa(lp96
VAnd after three weeks of debate, in the end,
p97
aVthe Senate did not cave in.
p98
aVInstead, they agreed to use the title "President" for now.
p99
aVBut they also wanted it absolutely set down
p100
aVthat they didn't agree with it,
p101
aVfrom a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civilized nations,
p102
aVwhether under republican or monarchical forms of government,
p103
aVwhose custom it is to annex,
p104
aVthrough the office of the Chief Magistrate,
p105
aVtitles of respectability \u2014
p106
aVnot bloody "President."
p107
aVAnd that, in the intercourse with foreign nations,
p108
aVthe majesty of the people of the United States
p109
aVmay not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity \u2014
p110
aVi.e., we don't want to look like bloody weirdos.
p111
aa(lp112
VNow, you can learn three interesting things from this.
p113
aVFirst of all \u2014 and this is my favorite \u2014
p114
aVis that, so far as I've ever been able to find out,
p115
aVthe Senate has never formally endorsed the title of President.
p116
aVBarack Obama, President Obama, is there on borrowed time,
p117
aVjust waiting for the Senate to spring into action.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VThe second thing you can learn
p122
aVis that, when a government says that this is a temporary measure \u2014
p123
aa(lp124
V(Laughter)
p125
aa(lp126
Vyou can still be waiting 223 years later.
p127
aa(lp128
VBut the third thing you can learn \u2014 and this is the really important one,
p129
aVthe point I want to leave you on \u2014
p130
aVis that the title, "President of the United States of America,"
p131
aVdoesn't sound that humble at all these days, does it?
p132
aVSomething to do with the slightly over 5,000
p133
aVnuclear warheads he has at his disposal
p134
aVand the largest economy in the world
p135
aVand a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff.
p136
aVReality and history have endowed that title with grandeur.
p137
aVAnd so the Senate won in the end.
p138
aVThey got their title of respectability.
p139
aVAnd also, the Senate's other worry, the appearance of singularity \u2014
p140
aVwell, it was a singularity back then.
p141
aVBut now, do you know how many nations have a president?
p142
aVA hundred and forty-seven.
p143
aVAll because they want to sound like the guy
p144
aVwho's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads, etc.
p145
aa(lp146
VAnd so, in the end, the Senate won
p147
aVand the House of Representatives lost ...
p148
aVbecause nobody's going to feel that humble
p149
aVwhen they're told that they are now
p150
aVthe President of the United States of America.
p151
aVAnd that's the important lesson I think you can take away,
p152
aVand the one I want to leave you with.
p153
aVPoliticians try to pick and use words to shape and control reality,
p154
aVbut in fact,
p155
aVreality changes words far more than words can ever change reality.
p156
