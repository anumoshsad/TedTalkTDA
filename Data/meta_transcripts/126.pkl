VI'd like to start tonight by something completely different,
p4
aVasking you to join me by stepping off the land
p5
aVand jumping into the open ocean for a moment.
p6
aV90 percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean,
p7
aVand it's where life \u2014 the title of our seminar tonight \u2014 it's where life began.
p8
aVAnd it's a lively and a lovely place,
p9
aVbut we're rapidly changing the oceans with our \u2014
p10
aVnot only with our overfishing, our irresponsible fishing,
p11
aVour adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland,
p12
aVbut also, most recently, with climate change,
p13
aVand Steve Schneider, I'm sure, will be going into greater detail on this.
p14
aVNow, as we continue to tinker with the oceans,
p15
aVmore and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating
p16
aVwill be conducive to low-energy type of animals, like jellyfish and bacteria.
p17
aVAnd this might be the kind of seas we're headed for.
p18
aa(lp19
VNow jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful,
p20
aVand you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday,
p21
aVbut they sting like hell, and jellyfish sushi and sashimi
p22
aVis just not going to fill you up.
p23
aVAbout 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories.
p24
aVSo it may be good for the waistline,
p25
aVbut it probably won't keep you satiated for very long.
p26
aVAnd a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish
p27
aVisn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans,
p28
aVthat is, unless you eat jellyfish.
p29
aVAnd this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack
p30
aVon this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there, a by-the-wind sailor.
p31
aVAnd that predator is the giant ocean sunfish, the Mola mola,
p32
aVwhose primary prey are jellyfish.
p33
aa(lp34
VThis animal is in "The Guinness World Book of Records"
p35
aVfor being the world's heaviest bony fish.
p36
aVIt reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds \u2014 on a diet of jellyfish, primarily.
p37
aVAnd I think it's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here
p38
aVthat the Mola mola \u2014 its common name is sunfish \u2014
p39
aVthat its favorite food is the moon jelly.
p40
aVSo it's kind of nice, the sun and the moon getting together this way,
p41
aVeven if one is eating the other.
p42
aVNow this is typically how you see sunfish,
p43
aVthis is where they get their common name.
p44
aVThey like to sunbathe, can't blame them.
p45
aVThey just lay out on the surface of the sea
p46
aVand most people think they're sick or lazy, but that's a typical behavior,
p47
aVthey lie out and bask on the surface.
p48
aa(lp49
VTheir other name, Mola mola, is \u2014 it sounds Hawaiian,
p50
aVbut it's actually Latin for millstone,
p51
aVand that's attributable to their roundish, very bizarre, cut-off shape.
p52
aVIt's as if, as they were growing, they just forgot the tail part.
p53
aVAnd that's actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place,
p54
aVwas this terribly bizarre shape.
p55
aVYou know, you look at sharks, and they're streamlined, and they're sleek,
p56
aVand you look at tuna, and they're like torpedoes \u2014
p57
aVthey just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength,
p58
aVand then you look at the sunfish.
p59
aa(lp60
V(Laughter)
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd this is just so elegantly mysterious, it's just \u2014
p63
aVit really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say, a tuna.
p64
aVSo I was just intrigued with what \u2014 you know, what is this animal's story?
p65
aVWell, as with anything in biology, nothing really makes sense
p66
aVexcept in the light of evolution.
p67
aVThe Mola's no exception.
p68
aVThey appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared,
p69
aV65 million years ago, at a time when whales still had legs,
p70
aVand they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction \u2014
p71
aVoblige me a little Kipling-esque storytelling here.
p72
aVOf course evolution is somewhat random, and you know,
p73
aVabout 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction
p74
aVthat said, oh, the heck with the coral reefs \u2014
p75
aVwe're going to head to the high seas.
p76
aVAnd lots of generations, lots of tweaking and torquing,
p77
aVand we turn our puffer into the Mola.
p78
aVYou know, if you give Mother Nature enough time, that is what she will produce.
p79
aa(lp80
VThey look \u2014 maybe they look
p81
aVkind of prehistoric and unfinished, abridged perhaps,
p82
aVbut in fact, in fact they are the \u2014
p83
aVthey vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea,
p84
aVright up there with flat fish.
p85
aVThey're \u2014 every single thing about that fish has been changed.
p86
aVAnd in terms of fishes \u2014
p87
aVfishes appeared 500 million years ago, and they're pretty modern,
p88
aVjust 50 million years ago, so \u2014
p89
aVso interestingly, they give away their ancestry as they develop.
p90
aVThey start as little eggs,
p91
aVand they're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again
p92
aVfor having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet.
p93
aVA single four-foot female had 300 million eggs,
p94
aVcan carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries \u2014 imagine \u2014
p95
aVand they get to be over 10 feet long. Imagine what a 10 foot one has.
p96
aVAnd from that little egg,
p97
aVthey pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage, reminiscent of their ancestry,
p98
aVand develop \u2014 this is their little adolescent stage.
p99
aVThey school as adolescents, and become behemoth loners as adults.
p100
aVThat's a little diver up there in the corner.
p101
aa(lp102
VThey're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again
p103
aVfor being the vertebrate growth champion of the world.
p104
aVFrom their little hatching size of their egg, into their little larval stage
p105
aVtill they reach adulthood, they put on 600 million times an increase in weight.
p106
aV600 million. Now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby,
p107
aVand you had to feed this thing.
p108
aVThat would mean that your child, you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics.
p109
aVNow I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but \u2014
p110
aVwe don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild,
p111
aVbut captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium \u2014
p112
aVone of the first places to have them in captivity \u2014
p113
aVthey had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months.
p114
aVI said, now, that's a true American.
p115
aa(lp116
V(Laughter)
p117
aa(lp118
V(Applause)
p119
aa(lp120
VSo being a loner is a great thing, especially in today's seas,
p121
aVbecause schooling used to be salvation for fishes,
p122
aVbut it's suicide for fishes now.
p123
aVBut unfortunately Molas, even though they don't school,
p124
aVthey still get caught in nets as by-catch.
p125
aVIf we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination,
p126
aVthen we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators \u2014
p127
aVhow they live their lives, like the Mola.
p128
aVAnd unfortunately, they make up a large portion of the California by-catch \u2014
p129
aVup to 26 percent of the drift net.
p130
aVAnd in the Mediterranean, in the swordfish net fisheries,
p131
aVthey make up up to 90 percent.
p132
aVSo we've got to figure out how they're living their lives.
p133
aVAnd how do you do that?
p134
aVHow do you do that with an animal \u2014 very few places in the world.
p135
aVThis is an open ocean creature. It knows no boundaries \u2014 it doesn't go to land.
p136
aa(lp137
VHow do you get insight?
p138
aVHow do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets?
p139
aVWell, there's some great new technology
p140
aVthat has just recently become available,
p141
aVand it's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals.
p142
aVAnd it's pictured right here, that little tag up there.
p143
aVThat little tag can record temperature, depth and light intensity,
p144
aVwhich is correlated with time, and from that we can get locations.
p145
aVAnd it can record this data for up to two years,
p146
aVand keep it in that tag, release at a pre-programmed time,
p147
aVfloat to the surface, upload all that data, that whole travelogue,
p148
aVto satellite, which relays it directly to our computers,
p149
aVand we've got that whole dataset. And we didn't even have \u2014
p150
aVwe just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know, sat at our desks.
p151
aVSo the great thing about the Mola
p152
aVis that when we put the tag on them \u2014 if you look up here \u2014
p153
aVthat's streaming off, that's right where we put the tag.
p154
aVAnd it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola.
p155
aa(lp156
VMolas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites.
p157
aVThey're just parasite hotels; even their parasites have parasites.
p158
aVI think Donne wrote a poem about that.
p159
aVBut they have 40 genera of parasites,
p160
aVand so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem.
p161
aVAnd they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment.
p162
aVThey don't seem to mind, so far.
p163
aVSo what are we trying to find out? We're focusing on the Pacific.
p164
aVWe're tagging on the California coast, and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan.
p165
aVAnd we're interested in how these animals are using the currents,
p166
aVusing temperature, using the open ocean, to live their lives.
p167
aVWe'd love to tag in Monterey.
p168
aVMonterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers.
p169
aVNot this time of year \u2014 it's more around October.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd we'd love to tag here \u2014 this is an aerial shot of Monterey \u2014
p172
aVbut unfortunately, the Molas here end up looking like this
p173
aVbecause another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way.
p174
aVThe California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay,
p175
aVrips off their fins, fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee, Mola style,
p176
aVand then tosses them back and forth.
p177
aVAnd I'm not exaggerating, it is just \u2014
p178
aVand sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful.
p179
aVAnd you know, the locals think it's terrible behavior,
p180
aVit's just horrible watching this happen, day after day.
p181
aVThe poor little Molas coming in, getting ripped to shreds,
p182
aVso we head down south, to San Diego.
p183
aVNot so many California sea lions down there.
p184
aVAnd the Molas there, you can find them with a spotter plane very easily,
p185
aVand they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp.
p186
aVAnd under those kelps \u2014 this is why the Molas come there
p187
aVbecause it's spa time for the Molas there.
p188
aVAs soon as they get under those rafts of kelp, the exfoliating cleaner fish come.
p189
aVAnd they come and give the Molas \u2014
p190
aVyou can see they strike this funny little position that says,
p191
aV"I'm not threatening, but I need a massage."
p192
aa(lp193
V(Laughter)
p194
aa(lp195
VAnd they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head,
p196
aVand the fish come up and they just clean, clean, clean \u2014
p197
aVbecause the Molas, you know, there's just a smorgasbord of parasites.
p198
aVAnd it's also a great place to go down south
p199
aVbecause the water's warmer, and the Molas are kind of friendly down there.
p200
aVI mean what other kind of fish, if you approach it right,
p201
aVwill say, "Okay, scratch me right there."
p202
aVYou truly can swim up to a Mola \u2014 they're very gentle \u2014
p203
aVand if you approach them right, you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it.
p204
aVSo we've also tagged one part of the Pacific;
p205
aVwe've gone over to another part of the Pacific,
p206
aVand we've tagged in Taiwan, and we tagged in Japan.
p207
aVAnd over in these places, the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries.
p208
aVAnd they're not thrown back as by-catch, they're eaten.
p209
aVWe were served a nine-course meal of Mola after we tagged.
p210
aVWell, not the one we tagged!
p211
aVAnd everything from the kidney, to the testes, to the back bone,
p212
aVto the fin muscle to \u2014 I think that ís pretty much the whole fish \u2014 is eaten.
p213
aa(lp214
VSo the hardest part of tagging, now, is
p215
aVafter you put that tag on, you have to wait, months.
p216
aVAnd you're just wondering, oh, I hope the fish is safe,
p217
aVI hope, I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out
p218
aVduring the course that the tag is recording.
p219
aVThe tags cost 3500 dollars each, and then satellite time is another 500 dollars,
p220
aVso you're like, oh, I hope the tag is okay.
p221
aVAnd so the waiting is really the hardest part.
p222
aVI'm going to show you our latest dataset.
p223
aVAnd it hasn't been published, so it's totally privy information just for TED.
p224
aVAnd in showing you this, you know, when we're looking at this data,
p225
aVwe're thinking, oh do these animals, do they cross the equator?
p226
aVDo they go from one side of the Pacific to the other?
p227
aVAnd we found that they kind of are homebodies.
p228
aVThey're not big migrators. This is their track:
p229
aVwe deployed the tag off of Tokyo, and the Mola in one month
p230
aVkind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there.
p231
aVAnd after four months, went up, you know, off of the north part of Japan.
p232
aVAnd that's kind of their home range.
p233
aVNow that's important, though, because if there's a lot of fishing pressure,
p234
aVthat population doesn't get replenished.
p235
aVSo that's a very important piece of data.
p236
aa(lp237
VBut also what's important is that they're not slacker, lazy fish.
p238
aVThey're super industrious.
p239
aVAnd this is a day in the life of a Mola, and if we \u2014
p240
aVthey're up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up
p241
aVand up and down, up to 40 times a day.
p242
aVAs the sun comes up, you see in the blue, they start their dive.
p243
aVDown \u2014 and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper, little deeper.
p244
aVThey plumb the depths down to 600 meters, in temperatures to one degree centigrade,
p245
aVand this is why you see them on the surface \u2014 it's so cold down there.
p246
aVThey've got to come up, warm, get that solar power,
p247
aVand then plunge back into the depths, and go up and down and up and down.
p248
aVAnd they're hitting a layer down there; it's called the deep scattering layer \u2014
p249
aVwhich a whole variety of food's in that layer.
p250
aVSo rather than just being some sunbathing slacker,
p251
aVthey're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance
p252
aVbetween the surface and the bottom and through temperature.
p253
aa(lp254
VWe see the same pattern \u2014 now with these tags
p255
aVwe're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes, manta rays, tunas,
p256
aVa real three-dimensional play.
p257
aVThis is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life,
p258
aVwhere they're going to be tagging all over the world
p259
aVand the Mola's going to enter into that.
p260
aVAnd what's exciting \u2014 you all travel, and you know
p261
aVthe best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals,
p262
aVand to find the great places by getting the local knowledge.
p263
aVWell now with the Census of Marine Life, we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals
p264
aVand explore 90 percent of our living space, with local knowledge.
p265
aVIt's never \u2014 it's really never been a more exciting, or a vital time, to be a biologist.
p266
aa(lp267
VWhich brings me to my last point, and what I think is kind of the most fun.
p268
aVI set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish.
p269
aVAnd so I just figured I'd have the questions answered,
p270
aVand I'd be able to thank my funders, like National Geographic and Lindbergh.
p271
aVBut people would write into the site with all sorts of,
p272
aVall sorts of stories about these animals
p273
aVand wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis.
p274
aVAnd what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared \u2014
p275
aVa shared love and an interest in the oceans.
p276
aVI was getting reports from Catholic nuns,
p277
aVJewish Rabbis, Muslims, Christians \u2014 everybody writing in,
p278
aVunited by their love of life.
p279
aVAnd to me that \u2014 I don't think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself:
p280
aV"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin."
p281
aVAnd sure, it may be just one big old silly fish, but it's helping.
p282
aVIf it's helping to unite the world, I think it's definitely the fish of the future.
