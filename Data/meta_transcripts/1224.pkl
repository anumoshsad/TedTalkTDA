VI want to say that really and truly,
p4
aVafter these incredible speeches
p5
aVand ideas that are being spread,
p6
aVI am in the awkward position
p7
aVof being here to talk to you today
p8
aVabout television.
p9
aVSo most everyone watches TV.
p10
aVWe like it. We like some parts of it.
p11
aVHere in America, people actually love TV.
p12
aVThe average American watches TV
p13
aVfor almost 5 hours a day.
p14
aVOkay?
p15
aVNow I happen to make my living these days in television,
p16
aVso for me, that's a good thing.
p17
aVBut a lot of people don't love it so much.
p18
aVThey, in fact, berate it.
p19
aVThey call it stupid,
p20
aVand worse, believe me.
p21
aVMy mother, growing up,
p22
aVshe called it the "idiot box."
p23
aa(lp24
VBut my idea today is not to debate
p25
aVwhether there's such a thing as good TV or bad TV;
p26
aVmy idea today
p27
aVis to tell you that I believe
p28
aVtelevision has a conscience.
p29
aVSo why I believe that television has a conscience
p30
aVis that I actually believe
p31
aVthat television directly reflects
p32
aVthe moral, political,
p33
aVsocial and emotional need states of our nation \u2014
p34
aVthat television is how we actually disseminate
p35
aVour entire value system.
p36
aVSo all these things are uniquely human,
p37
aVand they all add up
p38
aVto our idea of conscience.
p39
aa(lp40
VNow today, we're not talking about good and bad TV.
p41
aVWe're talking about popular TV.
p42
aVWe're talking about top-10 Nielsen-rated shows
p43
aVover the course of 50 years.
p44
aVHow do these Nielsen ratings
p45
aVreflect not just what you've heard about,
p46
aVwhich is the idea of our social, collective unconscious,
p47
aVbut how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated shows
p48
aVover 50 years
p49
aVreflect the idea
p50
aVof our social conscience?
p51
aVHow does television evolve over time,
p52
aVand what does this say about our society?
p53
aa(lp54
VNow speaking of evolution,
p55
aVfrom basic biology, you probably remember
p56
aVthat the animal kingdom, including humans,
p57
aVhave four basic primal instincts.
p58
aVYou have hunger; you have sex; you have power;
p59
aVand you have the urge for acquisitiveness.
p60
aVAs humans, what's important to remember
p61
aVis that we've developed, we've evolved over time
p62
aVto temper, or tame,
p63
aVthese basic animal instincts.
p64
aVWe have the capacity to laugh and cry.
p65
aVWe feel awe, we feel pity.
p66
aVThat is separate and apart
p67
aVfrom the animal kingdom.
p68
aVThe other thing about human beings
p69
aVis that we love to be entertained.
p70
aVWe love to watch TV.
p71
aVThis is something that clearly separates us
p72
aVfrom the animal kingdom.
p73
aVAnimals might love to play,
p74
aVbut they don't love to watch.
p75
aa(lp76
VSo I had an ambition
p77
aVto discover what could be understood
p78
aVfrom this uniquely human relationship
p79
aVbetween television programs
p80
aVand the human conscious.
p81
aVWhy has television entertainment evolved the way it has?
p82
aVI kind of think of it
p83
aVas this cartoon devil or angel
p84
aVsitting on our shoulders.
p85
aVIs television literally functioning
p86
aVas our conscience,
p87
aVtempting us and rewarding us at the same time?
p88
aa(lp89
VSo to begin to answer these questions,
p90
aVwe did a research study.
p91
aVWe went back 50 years
p92
aVto the 1959/1960 television season.
p93
aVWe surveyed the top-20 Nielsen shows
p94
aVevery year for 50 years \u2014
p95
aVa thousand shows.
p96
aVWe talked to over 3,000 individuals \u2014
p97
aValmost 3,600 \u2014
p98
aVaged 18 to 70,
p99
aVand we asked them how they felt emotionally.
p100
aVHow did you feel
p101
aVwatching every single one of these shows?
p102
aVDid you feel a sense of moral ambiguity?
p103
aVDid you feel outrage? Did you laugh?
p104
aVWhat did this mean for you?
p105
aVSo to our global TED audiences,
p106
aVI want to say that this was a U.S. sample.
p107
aVBut as you can see,
p108
aVthese emotional need states are truly universal.
p109
aVAnd on a factual basis,
p110
aVover 80 percent of the U.S.'s most popular shows
p111
aVare exported around the world.
p112
aVSo I really hope our global audiences
p113
aVcan relate.
p114
aa(lp115
VTwo acknowledgments
p116
aVbefore our first data slide:
p117
aVFor inspiring me
p118
aVto even think about the idea of conscience
p119
aVand the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis,
p120
aVI thank legendary rabbi, Jack Stern.
p121
aVAnd for the way in which I'm going to present the data,
p122
aVI want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling,
p123
aVwho you may have just seen.
p124
aa(lp125
VOkay, here we go.
p126
aVSo here you see,
p127
aVfrom 1960 to 2010,
p128
aVthe 50 years of our study.
p129
aVTwo things we're going to start with \u2014
p130
aVthe inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state,
p131
aVwhich, for this purpose,
p132
aVwe defined inspiration
p133
aVas television shows that uplift me,
p134
aVthat make me feel much more positive about the world.
p135
aVMoral ambiguity are televisions shows
p136
aVin which I don't understand
p137
aVthe difference between right and wrong.
p138
aVAs we start, you see in 1960
p139
aVinspiration is holding steady.
p140
aVThat's what we're watching TV for.
p141
aVMoral ambiguity starts to climb.
p142
aVRight at the end of the 60s,
p143
aVmoral ambiguity is going up,
p144
aVinspiration is kind of on the wane.
p145
aVWhy?
p146
aVThe Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK is shot,
p147
aVthe Civil Rights movement,
p148
aVrace riots, the Vietnam War,
p149
aVMLK is shot, Bobby Kennedy is shot,
p150
aVWatergate.
p151
aVLook what happens.
p152
aVIn 1970, inspiration plummets.
p153
aVMoral ambiguity takes off.
p154
aVThey cross,
p155
aVbut Ronald Reagan, a telegenic president, is in office.
p156
aVIt's trying to recover.
p157
aVBut look, it can't:
p158
aVAIDS, Iran-Contra,
p159
aVthe Challenger disaster, Chernobyl.
p160
aVMoral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television
p161
aVfrom 1990 for the next 20 years.
p162
aa(lp163
VTake a look at this.
p164
aVThis chart is going to document a very similar trend.
p165
aVBut in this case, we have comfort \u2014 the bubble in red \u2014
p166
aVsocial commentary and irreverence
p167
aVin blue and green.
p168
aVNow this time on TV
p169
aVyou have "Bonanza," don't forget, you have "Gunsmoke,"
p170
aVyou have "Andy Griffith,"
p171
aVyou have domestic shows all about comfort.
p172
aVThis is rising. Comfort stays whole.
p173
aVIrreverence starts to rise.
p174
aVSocial commentary is all of a sudden spiking up.
p175
aVYou get to 1969, and look what happens.
p176
aVYou have comfort, irreverence, and social commentary,
p177
aVnot only battling it out in our society,
p178
aVbut you literally have two establishment shows \u2014
p179
aV"Gunsmoke" and "Gomer Pyle" \u2014
p180
aVin 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows.
p181
aVWhat's number one?
p182
aVThe socially irreverent hippie show,
p183
aV"Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In."
p184
aVThey're all living together, right.
p185
aVViewers had responded dramatically.
p186
aa(lp187
VLook at this green spike in 1966
p188
aVto a bellwether show.
p189
aVWhen you guys hear this industry term, a breakout hit,
p190
aVwhat does that mean?
p191
aVIt means in the 1966 television season,
p192
aVThe "Smothers Brothers" came out of nowhere.
p193
aVThis was the first show
p194
aVthat allowed viewers to say,
p195
aV"My God,
p196
aVI can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War,
p197
aVabout the presidency, through television?"
p198
aVThat's what we mean by a breakout show.
p199
aa(lp200
VSo then, just like the last chart, look what happens.
p201
aVIn 1970,
p202
aVthe dam bursts. The dam bursts.
p203
aVComfort is no longer why we watch television.
p204
aVSocial commentary and irreverence
p205
aVrise throughout the 70s.
p206
aVNow look at this.
p207
aVThe 70s means who? Norman Lear.
p208
aVYou have "All in the Family," "Sanford and Son,"
p209
aVand the dominant show \u2014
p210
aVin the top-10 for the entire 70s \u2014
p211
aV"MAS*H."
p212
aVIn the entire 50 years
p213
aVof television that we studied,
p214
aVseven of 10 shows
p215
aVranked most highly for irreverence
p216
aVappeared on air during the Vietnam War,
p217
aVfive of the top-10 during the Nixon administration.
p218
aVOnly one generation, 20 years in,
p219
aVand we discovered,
p220
aVWow! TV can do that?
p221
aVIt can make me feel this?
p222
aVIt can change us?
p223
aVSo to this very, very savvy crowd,
p224
aVI also want to note
p225
aVthe digital folks did not invent disruptive.
p226
aVArchie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair
p227
aValong with the rest of us
p228
aV40 years ago.
p229
aa(lp230
VThis is a quick chart. Here's another attribute:
p231
aVfantasy and imagination,
p232
aVwhich are shows defined as,
p233
aV"takes me out of my everyday realm"
p234
aVand "makes me feel better."
p235
aVThat's mapped against the red dot, unemployment,
p236
aVwhich is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic.
p237
aVYou'll see
p238
aVthat every time fantasy and imagination shows rise,
p239
aVit maps to a spike in unemployment.
p240
aVDo we want to see shows
p241
aVabout people saving money and being unemployed?
p242
aVNo. In the 70s
p243
aVyou have the bellwether show "The Bionic Woman"
p244
aVthat rocketed into the top-10 in 1973,
p245
aVfollowed by the "Six Million-Dollar Man" and "Charlie's Angels."
p246
aVAnother spike in the 1980s \u2014
p247
aVanother spike in shows about control and power.
p248
aVWhat were those shows?
p249
aVGlamorous and rich.
p250
aV"Dallas," "Fantasy Island."
p251
aVIncredible mapping of our national psyche
p252
aVwith some hard and fast facts:
p253
aVunemployment.
p254
aa(lp255
VSo here you are, in my favorite chart,
p256
aVbecause this is our last 20 years.
p257
aVWhether or not you're in my business,
p258
aVyou have surely heard or read
p259
aVof the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom
p260
aVand the rise of reality TV.
p261
aVWell, as we say in the business,
p262
aVX marks the spot.
p263
aVThe 90s \u2014 the big bubbles of humor \u2014
p264
aVwe're watching "Friends," "Frasier," "Cheers" and "Seinfeld."
p265
aVEverything's good, low unemployment.
p266
aVBut look: X marks the spot.
p267
aVIn 2001,
p268
aVthe September 2001 television season,
p269
aVhumor succumbs to judgment once and for all.
p270
aVWhy not?
p271
aVWe had a 2000 presidential election
p272
aVdecided by the Supreme Court.
p273
aVWe had the bursting of the tech bubble.
p274
aVWe had 9/11.
p275
aVAnthrax becomes part of the social lexicon.
p276
aVLook what happens when we keep going.
p277
aVAt the turn of the century, the Internet takes off,
p278
aVreality television has taken hold.
p279
aVWhat do people want in their TV then?
p280
aVI would have thought revenge
p281
aVor nostalgia.
p282
aVGive me some comfort; my world is falling apart.
p283
aVNo, they want judgment.
p284
aVI can vote you off the island.
p285
aVI can keep Sarah Palin's daughter dancing.
p286
aVI can choose the next American Idol. You're fired.
p287
aVThat's all great, right?
p288
aa(lp289
VSo as dramatically different as these television shows,
p290
aVpure entertainment, have been over the last 50 years \u2014
p291
aVwhat did I start with? \u2014
p292
aVone basic instinct remains.
p293
aVWe're animals, we need our moms.
p294
aVThere has not been a decade of television
p295
aVwithout a definitive, dominant TV mom.
p296
aVThe 1950s:
p297
aVJune Cleever in the original comfort show, "Leave it to Beaver."
p298
aVLucille Ball kept us laughing
p299
aVthrough the rise of social consciousness in the 60s.
p300
aVMaude Findlay,
p301
aVthe epitome of the irreverent 1970s,
p302
aVwho tackled abortion, divorce,
p303
aVeven menopause on TV.
p304
aVThe 1980s,
p305
aVour first cougar was given to us
p306
aVin the form of Alexis Carrington.
p307
aVMurphy Brown took on a vice president
p308
aVwhen she took on the idea of single parenthood.
p309
aVThis era's mom,
p310
aVBree Van de Kamp.
p311
aVNow I don't know if this is the devil or the angel
p312
aVsitting on our conscience,
p313
aVsitting on television's shoulders,
p314
aVbut I do know that I absolutely love this image.
p315
aa(lp316
VSo to you all,
p317
aVthe women of TEDWomen, the men of TEDWomen,
p318
aVthe global audiences of TEDWomen,
p319
aVthank you for letting me present my idea
p320
aVabout the conscience of television.
p321
aVBut let me also thank the incredible creators
p322
aVwho get up everyday
p323
aVto put their ideas on our television screens
p324
aVthroughout all these ages of television.
p325
aVThey give it life on television, for sure,
p326
aVbut it's you as viewers,
p327
aVthrough your collective social consciences,
p328
aVthat give it life, longevity,
p329
aVpower or not.
p330
aa(lp331
