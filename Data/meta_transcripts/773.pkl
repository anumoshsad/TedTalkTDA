VI think I'll start out and just talk a little bit
p4
aVabout what exactly autism is.
p5
aVAutism is a very big continuum
p6
aVthat goes from very severe \u2014 the child remains nonverbal \u2014
p7
aVall the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers.
p8
aVAnd I actually feel at home here,
p9
aVbecause there's a lot of autism genetics here.
p10
aa(lp11
V(Laughter)
p12
aa(lp13
VYou wouldn't have any \u2014
p14
aa(lp15
V(Applause)
p16
aa(lp17
VIt's a continuum of traits.
p18
aVWhen does a nerd turn into Asperger, which is just mild autism?
p19
aVI mean, Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed
p20
aVas autistic spectrum today.
p21
aVAnd one of the things that is really going to concern me
p22
aVis getting these kids to be the ones
p23
aVthat are going to invent the next energy things
p24
aVthat Bill Gates talked about this morning.
p25
aa(lp26
VOK, now, if you want to understand autism: animals.
p27
aVI want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking.
p28
aVYou have to get away from verbal language.
p29
aVI think in pictures. I don't think in language.
p30
aVNow, the thing about the autistic mind is it attends to details.
p31
aVThis is a test where you either have to pick out the big letters
p32
aVor the little letters,
p33
aVand the autistic mind picks out the little letters more quickly.
p34
aa(lp35
VAnd the thing is, the normal brain ignores the details.
p36
aVWell, if you're building a bridge, details are pretty important
p37
aVbecause it'll fall down if you ignore the details.
p38
aVAnd one of my big concerns with a lot of policy things today
p39
aVis things are getting too abstract.
p40
aVPeople are getting away from doing hands-on stuff.
p41
aVI'm really concerned that a lot of the schools
p42
aVhave taken out the hands-on classes, because art, and classes like that \u2014
p43
aVthose are the classes where I excelled.
p44
aa(lp45
VIn my work with cattle,
p46
aVI noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice
p47
aVwould make the cattle balk.
p48
aVFor example, this flag waving right in front of the veterinary facility.
p49
aVThis feed yard was going to tear down their whole veterinary facility;
p50
aVall they needed to do was move the flag.
p51
aVRapid movement, contrast.
p52
aVIn the early '70s when I started, I got right down in the chutes
p53
aVto see what cattle were seeing.
p54
aVPeople thought that was crazy.
p55
aVA coat on a fence would make them balk, shadows would make them balk,
p56
aVa hose on the floor \u2014 people weren't noticing these things.
p57
aVA chain hanging down ...
p58
aVAnd that's shown very, very nicely in the movie.
p59
aa(lp60
VIn fact, I loved the movie, how they duplicated all my projects.
p61
aVThat's the geek side.
p62
aVMy drawings got to star in the movie, too.
p63
aVAnd, actually, it's called "Temple Grandin,"
p64
aVnot "Thinking in Pictures."
p65
aa(lp66
VSo what is thinking in pictures?
p67
aVIt's literally movies in your head.
p68
aVMy mind works like Google for images.
p69
aVWhen I was a young kid, I didn't know my thinking was different.
p70
aVI thought everybody thought in pictures.
p71
aVThen when I did my book, "Thinking in Pictures,"
p72
aVI started interviewing people about how they think.
p73
aVAnd I was shocked to find out that my thinking was quite different.
p74
aVLike if I say, "Think about a church steeple,"
p75
aVmost people get this sort of generalized generic one.
p76
aVNow, maybe that's not true in this room,
p77
aVbut it's going to be true in a lot of different places.
p78
aVI see only specific pictures.
p79
aVThey flash up into my memory, just like Google for pictures.
p80
aVAnd in the movie, they've got a great scene in there,
p81
aVwhere the word "shoe" is said, and a whole bunch of '50s and '60s shoes
p82
aVpop into my imagination.
p83
aa(lp84
VOK, there's my childhood church; that's specific.
p85
aVThere's some more, Fort Collins.
p86
aVOK, how about famous ones?
p87
aVAnd they just kind of come up, kind of like this.
p88
aVJust really quickly, like Google for pictures.
p89
aVAnd they come up one at a time,
p90
aVand then I think, "OK, well, maybe we can have it snow,
p91
aVor we can have a thunderstorm,"
p92
aVand I can hold it there and turn them into videos.
p93
aa(lp94
VNow, visual thinking was a tremendous asset
p95
aVin my work designing cattle-handling facilities.
p96
aVAnd I've worked really hard on improving how cattle are treated
p97
aVat the slaughter plant.
p98
aVI'm not going to go into any gucky slaughter slides.
p99
aVI've got that stuff up on YouTube, if you want to look at it.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Laughter)
p102
aa(lp103
VBut one of the things that I was able to do in my design work
p104
aVis I could test-run a piece of equipment in my mind,
p105
aVjust like a virtual reality computer system.
p106
aVAnd this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects
p107
aVthat was used in the movie.
p108
aVThat was like just so super cool.
p109
aVAnd there were a lot of, kind of, Asperger types and autism types
p110
aVworking out there on the movie set, too.
p111
aa(lp112
V(Laughter)
p113
aa(lp114
VBut one of the things that really worries me is:
p115
aVWhere's the younger version of those kids going today?
p116
aVThey're not ending up in Silicon Valley,
p117
aVwhere they belong.
p118
aa(lp119
V(Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
V(Applause)
p122
aa(lp123
VOne of the things I learned very early on because I wasn't that social,
p124
aVis I had to sell my work, and not myself.
p125
aVAnd the way I sold livestock jobs is I showed off my drawings,
p126
aVI showed off pictures of things.
p127
aVAnother thing that helped me as a little kid
p128
aVis, boy, in the '50s, you were taught manners.
p129
aVYou were taught you can't pull the merchandise off the shelves
p130
aVin the store and throw it around.
p131
aa(lp132
VWhen kids get to be in third or fourth grade,
p133
aVyou might see that this kid's going to be a visual thinker,
p134
aVdrawing in perspective.
p135
aVNow, I want to emphasize
p136
aVthat not every autistic kid is going to be a visual thinker.
p137
aVNow, I had this brain scan done several years ago,
p138
aVand I used to joke around about having a gigantic Internet trunk line
p139
aVgoing deep into my visual cortex.
p140
aVThis is tensor imaging.
p141
aVAnd my great big Internet trunk line is twice as big as the control's.
p142
aVThe red lines there are me,
p143
aVand the blue lines are the sex and age-matched control.
p144
aVAnd there I got a gigantic one,
p145
aVand the control over there, the blue one, has got a really small one.
p146
aa(lp147
VAnd some of the research now is showing
p148
aVthat people on the spectrum actually think with the primary visual cortex.
p149
aVNow, the thing is, the visual thinker is just one kind of mind.
p150
aVYou see, the autistic mind tends to be a specialist mind \u2014
p151
aVgood at one thing, bad at something else.
p152
aVAnd where I was bad was algebra.
p153
aVAnd I was never allowed to take geometry or trig.
p154
aVGigantic mistake.
p155
aVI'm finding a lot of kids who need to skip algebra,
p156
aVgo right to geometry and trig.
p157
aa(lp158
VNow, another kind of mind is the pattern thinker.
p159
aVMore abstract.
p160
aVThese are your engineers, your computer programmers.
p161
aVThis is pattern thinking.
p162
aVThat praying mantis is made from a single sheet of paper \u2014
p163
aVno scotch tape, no cuts.
p164
aVAnd there in the background is the pattern for folding it.
p165
aVHere are the types of thinking:
p166
aVphoto-realistic visual thinkers, like me;
p167
aVpattern thinkers, music and math minds.
p168
aVSome of these oftentimes have problems with reading.
p169
aVYou also will see these kind of problems with kids that are dyslexic.
p170
aVYou'll see these different kinds of minds.
p171
aVAnd then there's a verbal mind, they know every fact about everything.
p172
aa(lp173
VNow, another thing is the sensory issues.
p174
aVI was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face.
p175
aVAnd I came in half an hour beforehand
p176
aVso I could have it put on and kind of get used to it,
p177
aVand they got it bent so it's not hitting my chin.
p178
aVBut sensory is an issue.
p179
aVSome kids are bothered by fluorescent lights;
p180
aVothers have problems with sound sensitivity.
p181
aVYou know, it's going to be variable.
p182
aa(lp183
VNow, visual thinking gave me a whole lot of insight
p184
aVinto the animal mind.
p185
aVBecause think about it: an animal is a sensory-based thinker,
p186
aVnot verbal \u2014 thinks in pictures, thinks in sounds, thinks in smells.
p187
aVThink about how much information there is on the local fire hydrant.
p188
aVHe knows who's been there \u2014
p189
aa(lp190
V(Laughter)
p191
aa(lp192
VWhen they were there.
p193
aVAre they friend or foe? Is there anybody he can go mate with?
p194
aVThere's a ton of information on that fire hydrant.
p195
aVIt's all very detailed information.
p196
aVAnd looking at these kind of details gave me a lot of insight into animals.
p197
aa(lp198
VNow, the animal mind, and also my mind,
p199
aVputs sensory-based information into categories.
p200
aVMan on a horse,
p201
aVand a man on the ground \u2014
p202
aVthat is viewed as two totally different things.
p203
aVYou could have a horse that's been abused by a rider.
p204
aVThey'll be absolutely fine with the veterinarian
p205
aVand with the horseshoer, but you can't ride him.
p206
aVYou have another horse, where maybe the horseshoer beat him up,
p207
aVand he'll be terrible for anything on the ground with the veterinarian,
p208
aVbut a person can ride him.
p209
aVCattle are the same way.
p210
aVMan on a horse, a man on foot \u2014 they're two different things.
p211
aVYou see, it's a different picture.
p212
aVSee, I want you to think about just how specific this is.
p213
aa(lp214
VNow, this ability to put information into categories,
p215
aVI find a lot of people are not very good at this.
p216
aVWhen I'm out troubleshooting equipment
p217
aVor problems with something in a plant,
p218
aVthey don't seem to be able to figure out:
p219
aV"Do I have a training-people issue?
p220
aVOr do I have something wrong with the equipment?"
p221
aVIn other words, categorize equipment problem from a people problem.
p222
aVI find a lot of people have difficulty doing that.
p223
aVNow, let's say I figure out it's an equipment problem.
p224
aVIs it a minor problem, with something simple I can fix?
p225
aVOr is the whole design of the system wrong?
p226
aVPeople have a hard time figuring that out.
p227
aa(lp228
VLet's just look at something like, you know,
p229
aVsolving problems with making airlines safer.
p230
aVYeah, I'm a million-mile flier.
p231
aVI do lots and lots of flying,
p232
aVand if I was at the FAA,
p233
aVwhat would I be doing a lot of direct observation of?
p234
aVIt would be their airplane tails.
p235
aVYou know, five fatal wrecks in the last 20 years,
p236
aVthe tail either came off,
p237
aVor steering stuff inside the tail broke in some way.
p238
aVIt's tails, pure and simple.
p239
aVAnd when the pilots walk around the plane, guess what?
p240
aVThey can't see that stuff inside the tail.
p241
aVNow as I think about that,
p242
aVI'm pulling up all of that specific information.
p243
aVIt's specific.
p244
aVSee, my thinking's bottom-up.
p245
aVI take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle.
p246
aa(lp247
VNow, here is a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats.
p248
aVHe'd been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat.
p249
aVWhite cowboy hats, that was absolutely fine.
p250
aVNow, the thing is, the world is going to need
p251
aVall of the different kinds of minds to work together.
p252
aVWe've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds.
p253
aVAnd one of the things that is driving me really crazy
p254
aVas I travel around and I do autism meetings,
p255
aVis I'm seeing a lot of smart, geeky, nerdy kids,
p256
aVand they just aren't very social,
p257
aVand nobody's working on developing their interest
p258
aVin something like science.
p259
aa(lp260
VAnd this brings up the whole thing of my science teacher.
p261
aVMy science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie.
p262
aVI was a goofball student when I was in high school.
p263
aVI just didn't care at all about studying,
p264
aVuntil I had Mr. Carlock's science class.
p265
aVHe was now Dr. Carlock in the movie.
p266
aVAnd he got me challenged to figure out an optical illusion room.
p267
aVThis brings up the whole thing of you've got to show kids
p268
aVinteresting stuff.
p269
aVYou know, one of the things that I think maybe TED ought to do
p270
aVis tell all the schools about all the great lectures that are on TED,
p271
aVand there's all kinds of great stuff on the Internet
p272
aVto get these kids turned on.
p273
aVBecause I'm seeing a lot of these geeky, nerdy kids,
p274
aVand the teachers out in the Midwest and other parts of the country
p275
aVwhen you get away from these tech areas,
p276
aVthey don't know what to do with these kids.
p277
aVAnd they're not going down the right path.
p278
aa(lp279
VThe thing is, you can make a mind
p280
aVto be more of a thinking and cognitive mind,
p281
aVor your mind can be wired to be more social.
p282
aVAnd what some of the research now has shown in autism
p283
aVis there may by extra wiring back here in the really brilliant mind,
p284
aVand we lose a few social circuits here.
p285
aVIt's kind of a trade-off between thinking and social.
p286
aVAnd then you can get to the point where it's so severe,
p287
aVyou're going to have a person that's going to be non-verbal.
p288
aVIn the normal human mind,
p289
aVlanguage covers up the visual thinking we share with animals.
p290
aa(lp291
VThis is the work of Dr. Bruce Miller.
p292
aVHe studied Alzheimer's patients that had frontal temporal lobe dementia.
p293
aVAnd the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain.
p294
aVAnd then this artwork came out of somebody
p295
aVwho used to install stereos in cars.
p296
aVNow, Van Gogh doesn't know anything about physics,
p297
aVbut I think it's very interesting that there was some work done
p298
aVto show that this eddy pattern in this painting
p299
aVfollowed a statistical model of turbulence,
p300
aVwhich brings up the whole interesting idea
p301
aVof maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head.
p302
aa(lp303
VAnd the Wolfram stuff \u2014
p304
aVI was taking notes and writing down all the search words I could use,
p305
aVbecause I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures.
p306
aVWe've got to show these kids interesting stuff.
p307
aVAnd they've taken out the auto-shop class
p308
aVand the drafting class and the art class.
p309
aVI mean, art was my best subject in school.
p310
aa(lp311
VWe've got to think about all these different kinds of minds,
p312
aVand we've got to absolutely work with these kind of minds,
p313
aVbecause we absolutely are going to need
p314
aVthese kinds of people in the future.
p315
aVAnd let's talk about jobs.
p316
aVOK, my science teacher got me studying,
p317
aVbecause I was a goofball that didn't want to study.
p318
aVBut you know what? I was getting work experience.
p319
aVI'm seeing too many of these smart kids who haven't learned basic things,
p320
aVlike how to be on time \u2014 I was taught that when I was eight years old.
p321
aVHow to have table manners at granny's Sunday party.
p322
aVI was taught that when I was very, very young.
p323
aVAnd when I was 13, I had a job at a dressmaker's shop sewing clothes.
p324
aVI did internships in college,
p325
aVI was building things,
p326
aVand I also had to learn how to do assignments.
p327
aa(lp328
VYou know, all I wanted to do was draw pictures of horses when I was little.
p329
aVMy mother said, "Well let's do a picture of something else."
p330
aVThey've got to learn how to do something else.
p331
aVLet's say the kid is fixated on Legos.
p332
aVLet's get him working on building different things.
p333
aVThe thing about the autistic mind is it tends to be fixated.
p334
aVLike if the kid loves race cars, let's use race cars for math.
p335
aVLet's figure out how long it takes a race car to go a certain distance.
p336
aVIn other words, use that fixation
p337
aVin order to motivate that kid, that's one of the things we need to do.
p338
aVI really get fed up when the teachers,
p339
aVespecially when you get away from this part of the country,
p340
aVthey don't know what to do with these smart kids.
p341
aVIt just drives me crazy.
p342
aa(lp343
VWhat can visual thinkers do when they grow up?
p344
aVThey can do graphic design, all kinds of stuff with computers,
p345
aVphotography, industrial design.
p346
aVThe pattern thinkers \u2014 they're the ones that are going to be your mathematicians,
p347
aVyour software engineers, your computer programmers,
p348
aVall of those kinds of jobs.
p349
aVAnd then you've got the word minds; they make great journalists,
p350
aVand they also make really, really good stage actors.
p351
aVBecause the thing about being autistic is,
p352
aVI had to learn social skills like being in a play.
p353
aVYou just kind of ... you just have to learn it.
p354
aa(lp355
VAnd we need to be working with these students.
p356
aVAnd this brings up mentors.
p357
aVYou know, my science teacher was not an accredited teacher.
p358
aVHe was a NASA space scientist.
p359
aVSome states now are getting it to where, if you have a degree in biology
p360
aVor in chemistry,
p361
aVyou can come into the school and teach biology or chemistry.
p362
aVWe need to be doing that.
p363
aVBecause what I'm observing is,
p364
aVthe good teachers, for a lot of these kids,
p365
aVare out in the community colleges.
p366
aVBut we need to be getting some of these good teachers
p367
aVinto the high schools.
p368
aa(lp369
VAnother thing that can be very, very, very successful is:
p370
aVthere's a lot of people that may have retired
p371
aVfrom working in the software industry,
p372
aVand they can teach your kid.
p373
aVAnd it doesn't matter if what they teach them is old,
p374
aVbecause what you're doing is you're lighting the spark.
p375
aVYou're getting that kid turned on.
p376
aVAnd you get him turned on, then you'll learn all the new stuff.
p377
aVMentors are just essential.
p378
aVI cannot emphasize enough what my science teacher did for me.
p379
aVAnd we've got to mentor them, hire them.
p380
aa(lp381
VAnd if you bring them in for internships in your companies,
p382
aVthe thing about the autism, Asperger-y kind of mind,
p383
aVyou've got to give them a specific task.
p384
aVDon't just say, "Design new software."
p385
aVYou've got to tell them something more specific:
p386
aV"We're designing software for a phone
p387
aVand it has to do some specific thing,
p388
aVand it can only use so much memory."
p389
aVThat's the kind of specificity you need.
p390
aa(lp391
VWell, that's the end of my talk.
p392
aVAnd I just want to thank everybody for coming.
p393
aVIt was great to be here.
p394
aa(lp395
V(Applause)
p396
aV(Applause ends)
p397
aa(lp398
VOh \u2014 you have a question for me? OK.
p399
aa(lp400
V(Applause)
p401
aa(lp402
VChris Anderson: Thank you so much for that.
p403
aVYou know, you once wrote \u2014 I like this quote:
p404
aV"If by some magic, autism had been eradicated from the face of the Earth,
p405
aVthen men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire
p406
aVat the entrance to a cave."
p407
aa(lp408
V(Laughter)
p409
aa(lp410
VTemple Grandin: Because who do you think made the first stone spear?
p411
aVIt was the Asperger guy,
p412
aVand if you were to get rid of all the autism genetics,
p413
aVthere'd be no more Silicon Valley, and the energy crisis would not be solved.
p414
aa(lp415
V(Applause)
p416
aa(lp417
VCA: I want to ask you a couple other questions,
p418
aVand if any of these feel inappropriate, it's OK just to say, "Next question."
p419
aVBut if there is someone here who has an autistic child,
p420
aVor knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them,
p421
aVwhat advice would you give them?
p422
aa(lp423
VTG: Well, first of all, we've got to look at age.
p424
aVIf you have a two, three or four-year-old, no speech, no social interaction,
p425
aVI can't emphasize enough: Don't wait.
p426
aVYou need at least 20 hours a week of one-to-one teaching.
p427
aVThe thing is, autism comes in different degrees.
p428
aVAbout half of the people on the spectrum are not going to learn to talk,
p429
aVand they won't be working in Silicon Valley.
p430
aVThat would not be a reasonable thing for them to do.
p431
aa(lp432
VBut then you get these smart, geeky kids with a touch of autism,
p433
aVand that's where you've got to get them turned on

aVI got social interaction through shared interests \u2014
p436
aVI rode horses with other kids, I made model rockets with other kids,
p437
aVdid electronics lab with other kids.
p438
aVAnd in the '60s, it was gluing mirrors onto a rubber membrane on a speaker
p439
aVto make a light show.
p440
aVThat was, like, we considered that super cool.

VCA: Is it unrealistic for them
p445
aVto hope or think that that child loves them, as some might, as most, wish?
p446
aa(lp447
VTG: Well, I tell you, that child will be loyal,
p448
aVand if your house is burning down, they're going to get you out of it.
p449
aa(lp450
VCA: Wow. So most people, if you ask them what they're most passionate about,
p451
aVthey'd say things like, "My kids" or "My lover."
p452
aVWhat are you most passionate about?
p453
aa(lp454
VTG: I'm passionate about that the things I do
p455
aVare going to make the world a better place.
p456
aVWhen I have a mother of an autistic child say,
p457
aV"My kid went to college because of your book
p458
aVor one of your lectures,"
p459
aVthat makes me happy.
p460
aa(lp461
VYou know, the slaughter plants I worked with in the '80s;
p462
aVthey were absolutely awful.
p463
aVI developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants,
p464
aVwhere you just measure outcomes:
p465
aVHow many cattle fell down?
p466
aVHow many got poked with the prodder?
p467
aVHow many cattle are mooing their heads off?
p468
aVAnd it's very, very simple.
p469
aVYou directly observe a few simple things.
p470
aVIt's worked really well.
p471
aVI get satisfaction out of seeing stuff
p472
aVthat makes real change in the real world.
p473
aVWe need a lot more of that, and a lot less abstract stuff.
p474
aa(lp475
VCA: Totally.

VCA: When we were talking on the phone, one of the things you said
p480
aVthat really astonished me
p481
aVwas that one thing you were passionate about was server farms.
p482
aVTell me about that.
p483
aa(lp484
VTG: Well, the reason why I got really excited when I read about that,
p485
aVit contains knowledge.
p486
aVIt's libraries.
p487
aVAnd to me, knowledge is something that is extremely valuable.
p488
aVSo, maybe over 10 years ago now, our library got flooded.
p489
aVThis is before the Internet got really big.
p490
aVAnd I was really upset about all the books being wrecked,
p491
aVbecause it was knowledge being destroyed.
p492
aVAnd server farms, or data centers, are great libraries of knowledge.
p493
aa(lp494
VCA: Temple, can I just say,
p495
aVit's an absolute delight to have you at TED.
p496
aVThank you so much.
