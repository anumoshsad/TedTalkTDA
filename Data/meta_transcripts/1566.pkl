VYou know, we wake up in the morning,
p4
aVyou get dressed, put on your shoes,
p5
aVyou head out into the world.
p6
aVYou plan on coming back, getting undressed,
p7
aVgoing to bed,
p8
aVwaking up, doing it again,
p9
aVand that anticipation, that rhythm,
p10
aVhelps give us a structure
p11
aVto how we organize ourselves and our lives,
p12
aVand gives it a measure of predictability.
p13
aVLiving in New York City, as I do,
p14
aVit's almost as if, with so many people doing so many things
p15
aVat the same time in such close quarters,
p16
aVit's almost like life is dealing you extra hands
p17
aVout of that deck.
p18
aVYou're never, there's just, juxtapositions are possible
p19
aVthat just aren't, you don't think they're going to happen.
p20
aVAnd you never think you're going to be the guy
p21
aVwho's walking down the street
p22
aVand, because you choose to go down one side or the other,
p23
aVthe rest of your life is changed forever.
p24
aa(lp25
VAnd one night, I'm riding the uptown local train.
p26
aVI get on. I tend to be a little bit vigilant
p27
aVwhen I get on the subway.
p28
aVI'm not one of the people zoning out with headphones
p29
aVor a book.
p30
aVAnd I get on the car, and I look, and I
p31
aVnotice this couple,
p32
aVcollege-aged, student-looking kids,
p33
aVa guy and a girl, and they're sitting next to each other,
p34
aVand she's got her leg draped over his knee,
p35
aVand they're doing \u2014 they have this little contraption,
p36
aVand they're tying these knots,
p37
aVand they're doing it with one hand,
p38
aVthey're doing it left-handed and right-handed very quickly,
p39
aVand then she'll hand the thing to him and he'll do it.
p40
aVI've never seen anything like this.
p41
aVIt's almost like they're practicing magic tricks.
p42
aa(lp43
VAnd at the next stop, a guy gets on the car,
p44
aVand he has this sort of visiting professor look to him.
p45
aVHe's got the overstuffed leather satchel
p46
aVand the rectangular file case and a laptop bag
p47
aVand the tweed jacket with the leather patches,
p48
aVand \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p49
aVhe looks at them, and then
p50
aVin a blink of an eye, he kneels down in front of them,
p51
aVand he starts to say,
p52
aV"You know, listen, here's how you can do it. Look,
p53
aVif you do this \u2014 " and he takes the laces out of their hand,
p54
aVand instantly, he starts tying these knots,
p55
aVand even better than they were doing it, remarkably.
p56
aVAnd it turns out they are medical students
p57
aVon their way to a lecture about the latest
p58
aVsuturing techniques, and he's the guy giving the lecture.
p59
aV(Laughter)
p60
aa(lp61
VSo he starts to tell them, and he's like,
p62
aV"No, this is very important here. You know,
p63
aVwhen you're needing these knots,
p64
aVit's going to be, you know, everything's
p65
aVgoing to be happening at the same time, it's going to be \u2014
p66
aVyou're going to have all this information coming at you,
p67
aVthere's going to be organs getting in the way,
p68
aVit's going to be slippery,
p69
aVand
p70
aVit's just very important that you be able to do these
p71
aVbeyond second nature, each hand, left hand, right hand,
p72
aVyou have to be able to do them without seeing your fingers."
p73
aVAnd at that moment, when I heard that,
p74
aVI just got catapulted out of the subway car into a night
p75
aVwhen I had been getting a ride in an ambulance
p76
aVfrom the sidewalk where I had been stabbed
p77
aVto the trauma room of St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan,
p78
aVand what had happened was
p79
aVa gang had come in from Brooklyn.
p80
aVAs part of an initiation for three of their members,
p81
aVthey had to kill somebody,
p82
aVand I happened to be the guy walking down Bleecker Street
p83
aVthat night,
p84
aVand they jumped on me without a word.
p85
aVOne of the very lucky things,
p86
aVwhen I was at Notre Dame, I was on the boxing team,
p87
aVso I put my hands up right away, instinctively.
p88
aVThe guy on the right had a knife with a 10-inch blade,
p89
aVand he went in under my elbow,
p90
aVand it went up and cut my inferior vena cava.
p91
aVIf you know anything about anatomy,
p92
aVthat's not a good thing to get cut,
p93
aVand everything, of course, on the way up,
p94
aVand then \u2014 I still had my hands up \u2014
p95
aVhe pulled it out and went for my neck,
p96
aVand sunk it in up to the hilt in my neck,
p97
aVand I got one straight right punch
p98
aVand knocked the middle guy out.
p99
aVThe other guy was still working on me,
p100
aVcollapsing my other lung,
p101
aVand I managed to, by hitting that guy, to get a minute.
p102
aVI ran down the street and collapsed,
p103
aVand the ambulance guys intubated me on the sidewalk
p104
aVand let the trauma room know
p105
aVthey had an incoming.
p106
aa(lp107
VAnd one of the
p108
aVside effects of having major massive blood loss
p109
aVis you get tunnel vision,
p110
aVso I remember being on the stretcher
p111
aVand having a little nickel-sized cone of vision,
p112
aVand I was moving my head around
p113
aVand we got to St. Vincent's,
p114
aVand we're racing down this hallway,
p115
aVand I see the lights going,
p116
aVand it's a peculiar effect of memories like that.
p117
aVThey don't really go to the usual place that memories go.
p118
aVThey kind of have this vault where they're stored in high-def,
p119
aVand George Lucas did all the sound effects. (Laughter)
p120
aVSo sometimes, remembering them, it's like,
p121
aVit's not like any other kind of memories.
p122
aa(lp123
VAnd I get into the trauma room,
p124
aVand they're waiting for me, and the lights are there,
p125
aVand I'd been able to breathe a little more now,
p126
aVbecause the blood has left, had been filling up my lungs
p127
aVand I was having a very hard time breathing,
p128
aVbut now it's kind of gone into the stretcher.
p129
aVAnd I said, "Is there anything I can do to help?"
p130
aVand \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p131
aVthe nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh, and
p132
aVI'm turning my head trying to see everybody,
p133
aVand I had this weird memory of being in college
p134
aVand raising,
p135
aVraising money for the flood victims of Bangladesh,
p136
aVand then I look over and my anesthesiologist
p137
aVis clamping the mask on me, and I think,
p138
aV"He looks Bangladeshi," \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p139
aVand I just have those two facts, and I just think,
p140
aV"This could work somehow." (Laughter)
p141
aa(lp142
VAnd then I go out, and
p143
aVthey work on me for the rest of the night,
p144
aVand I needed about 40 units of blood to keep me there
p145
aVwhile they did their work,
p146
aVand the surgeon took out about a third of my intestines,
p147
aVmy cecum, organs I didn't know that I had,
p148
aVand he later told me one of the last things he did
p149
aVwhile he was in there was to remove my appendix for me,
p150
aVwhich I thought was great, you know,
p151
aVjust a little tidy thing there at the end. (Laughter)
p152
aVAnd I came to in the morning.
p153
aVOut of anesthetic, he had let them know
p154
aVthat he wanted to be there, and he had given me
p155
aVabout a two percent chance of living.
p156
aa(lp157
VSo he was there when I woke up,
p158
aVand it was, waking up was like
p159
aVbreaking through the ice into a frozen lake of pain.
p160
aVIt was that enveloping,
p161
aVand there was only one spot that didn't hurt
p162
aVworse than anything I'd ever felt,
p163
aVand it was my instep,
p164
aVand he was holding the arch of my foot
p165
aVand rubbing the instep with his thumb.
p166
aa(lp167
VAnd I looked up, and he's like,
p168
aV"Good to see you,"
p169
aVand I was trying to remember what had happened
p170
aVand trying to get my head around everything,
p171
aVand the pain was just overwhelming, and he said,
p172
aV"You know, we didn't cut your hair. I thought
p173
aVyou might have gotten strength from your hair like Samson,
p174
aVand you're going to need all the strength you can get."
p175
aVAnd in those days, my hair was down to my waist,
p176
aVI drove a motorcycle, I was unmarried,
p177
aVI owned a bar, so those were different times. (Laughter)
p178
aa(lp179
VBut
p180
aVI had three days of life support,
p181
aVand everybody was expecting,
p182
aVdue to just the massive amount of what they had had to do
p183
aVthat I wasn't going to make it,
p184
aVso it was three days of
p185
aVeverybody was either waiting for me to die or poop,
p186
aVand \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p187
aVwhen I finally pooped, then that somehow,
p188
aVsurgically speaking, that's like you crossed some good line,
p189
aVand, um \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p190
aVon that day, the surgeon came in
p191
aVand whipped the sheet off of me.
p192
aVHe had three or four friends with him,
p193
aVand he does that, and they all look,
p194
aVand there was no infection,
p195
aVand they bend over me and they're poking and prodding,
p196
aVand they're like, "There's no hematomas, blah blah,
p197
aVlook at the color," and they're talking amongst themselves
p198
aVand I'm, like, this restored automobile
p199
aVthat he's just going, "Yeah, I did that." (Laughter)
p200
aVAnd it was just,
p201
aVit was amazing, because these guys are high-fiving him
p202
aVover how good I turned out, you know? (Laughter)
p203
aVAnd it's my zipper, and I've still got the staples in
p204
aVand everything.
p205
aa(lp206
VAnd
p207
aVlater on, when I got out
p208
aVand the flashbacks and the
p209
aVnightmares were giving me a hard time,
p210
aVI went back to him
p211
aVand I was sort of asking him,
p212
aVyou know, what am I gonna do?
p213
aVAnd I think, kind of, as a surgeon, he basically said,
p214
aV"Kid, I saved your life.
p215
aVLike, now you can do whatever you want, like,
p216
aVyou gotta get on with that.
p217
aVIt's like I gave you a new car
p218
aVand you're complaining about not finding parking.
p219
aVLike, just, go out, and, you know, do your best.
p220
aVBut you're alive. That's what it's about."
p221
aa(lp222
VAnd then I hear, "Bing-bong," and the subway doors
p223
aVare closing, and my stop is next, and I look at these kids,
p224
aVand I go, I think to myself,
p225
aV"I'm going to lift my shirt up
p226
aVand show them," \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014
p227
aVand then I think, "No, this is the New York City subway,
p228
aVthat's going to lead to other things." (Laughter)
p229
aa(lp230
VAnd so I just think, they got their lecture to go to.
p231
aVI step off, I'm standing on the platform,
p232
aVand I feel my index finger
p233
aVin
p234
aVthe first scar that I ever got,
p235
aVfrom my umbilical cord,
p236
aVand then around that, is traced
p237
aVthe last scar that I got
p238
aVfrom my surgeon,
p239
aVand I think that, that chance encounter
p240
aVwith those kids on the street with their knives
p241
aVled me
p242
aVto my surgical team,
p243
aVand their training
p244
aVand their skill
p245
aVand, always, a little bit of luck
p246
aVpushed back against chaos.
p247
aa(lp248
VThank you. (Applause)
p249
aV(Applause)
p250
aVThank you. Very lucky to be here. Thank you. (Applause)
