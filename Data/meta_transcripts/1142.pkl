VThank you.
p4
aVI'm thrilled to be here.
p5
aVI'm going to talk about a new, old material
p6
aVthat still continues to amaze us,
p7
aVand that might impact the way we think
p8
aVabout material science, high technology \u2014
p9
aVand maybe, along the way,
p10
aValso do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation.
p11
aVSo that's kind of a bold statement.
p12
aVI'll tell you a little bit more.
p13
aVThis material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true.
p14
aVIt's sustainable; it's a sustainable material
p15
aVthat is processed all in water and at room temperature \u2014
p16
aVand is biodegradable with a clock,
p17
aVso you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water
p18
aVor have it stable for years.
p19
aVIt's edible; it's implantable in the human body
p20
aVwithout causing any immune response.
p21
aVIt actually gets reintegrated in the body.
p22
aVAnd it's technological,
p23
aVso it can do things like microelectronics,
p24
aVand maybe photonics do.
p25
aVAnd the material
p26
aVlooks something like this.
p27
aVIn fact, this material you see is clear and transparent.
p28
aVThe components of this material are just water and protein.
p29
aa(lp30
VSo this material is silk.
p31
aVSo it's kind of different
p32
aVfrom what we're used to thinking about silk.
p33
aVSo the question is, how do you reinvent something
p34
aVthat has been around for five millennia?
p35
aVThe process of discovery, generally, is inspired by nature.
p36
aVAnd so we marvel at silk worms \u2014
p37
aVthe silk worm you see here spinning its fiber.
p38
aVThe silk worm does a remarkable thing:
p39
aVit uses these two ingredients, protein and water,
p40
aVthat are in its gland,
p41
aVto make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection \u2014
p42
aVso comparable to technical fibers
p43
aVlike Kevlar.
p44
aVAnd so in the reverse engineering process
p45
aVthat we know about,
p46
aVand that we're familiar with,
p47
aVfor the textile industry,
p48
aVthe textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon
p49
aVand then weaves glamorous things.
p50
aVWe want to know how you go from water and protein
p51
aVto this liquid Kevlar, to this natural Kevlar.
p52
aa(lp53
VSo the insight
p54
aVis how do you actually reverse engineer this
p55
aVand go from cocoon to gland
p56
aVand get water and protein that is your starting material.
p57
aVAnd this is an insight
p58
aVthat came, about two decades ago,
p59
aVfrom a person that I'm very fortunate to work with,
p60
aVDavid Kaplan.
p61
aVAnd so we get this starting material.
p62
aVAnd so this starting material is back to the basic building block.
p63
aVAnd then we use this to do a variety of things \u2014
p64
aVlike, for example, this film.
p65
aVAnd we take advantage of something that is very simple.
p66
aVThe recipe to make those films
p67
aVis to take advantage of the fact
p68
aVthat proteins are extremely smart at what they do.
p69
aVThey find their way to self-assemble.
p70
aVSo the recipe is simple: you take the silk solution, you pour it,
p71
aVand you wait for the protein to self-assemble.
p72
aVAnd then you detach the protein and you get this film,
p73
aVas the proteins find each other as the water evaporates.
p74
aa(lp75
VBut I mentioned that the film is also technological.
p76
aVAnd so what does that mean?
p77
aVIt means that you can interface it
p78
aVwith some of the things that are typical of technology,
p79
aVlike microelectronics and nanoscale technology.
p80
aVAnd the image of the DVD here
p81
aVis just to illustrate a point
p82
aVthat silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface,
p83
aVwhich means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale.
p84
aVSo it would be able to replicate the information
p85
aVthat is on the DVD.
p86
aVAnd we can store information that's film with water and protein.
p87
aVSo we tried something out, and we wrote a message in a piece of silk,
p88
aVwhich is right here, and the message is over there.
p89
aVAnd much like in the DVD, you can read it out optically.
p90
aVAnd this requires a stable hand,
p91
aVso this is why I decided to do it onstage in front of a thousand people.
p92
aVSo let me see.
p93
aVSo as you see the film go in transparently through there,
p94
aVand then ...
p95
aV(Applause)
p96
aVAnd the most remarkable feat
p97
aVis that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that.
p98
aa(lp99
VSo once you have these attributes
p100
aVof this material,
p101
aVthen you can do a lot of things.
p102
aVIt's actually not limited to films.
p103
aVAnd so the material can assume a lot of formats.
p104
aVAnd then you go a little crazy, and so you do various optical components
p105
aVor you do microprism arrays,
p106
aVlike the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes.
p107
aVOr you can do beautiful things
p108
aVthat, if the camera can capture, you can make.
p109
aVYou can add a third dimensionality to the film.
p110
aVAnd if the angle is right,
p111
aVyou can actually see a hologram appear in this film of silk.
p112
aVBut you can do other things.
p113
aVYou can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light,
p114
aVand so we've made optical fibers.
p115
aa(lp116
VBut silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics.
p117
aVAnd you can think of different formats.
p118
aVSo for instance, if you're afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle,
p119
aVwe do microneedle arrays.
p120
aVWhat you see there on the screen is a human hair
p121
aVsuperimposed on the needle that's made of silk \u2014
p122
aVjust to give you a sense of size.
p123
aVYou can do bigger things.
p124
aVYou can do gears and nuts and bolts \u2014
p125
aVthat you can buy at Whole Foods.
p126
aVAnd the gears work in water as well.
p127
aVSo you think of alternative mechanical parts.
p128
aVAnd maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong
p129
aVto replace peripheral veins, for example,
p130
aVor maybe an entire bone.
p131
aVAnd so you have here a little example
p132
aVof a small skull \u2014
p133
aVwhat we call mini Yorick.
p134
aV(Laughter)
p135
aVBut you can do things like cups, for example,
p136
aVand so, if you add a little bit of gold, if you add a little bit of semiconductors
p137
aVyou could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods.
p138
aVYou can do electronic pieces
p139
aVthat fold and wrap.
p140
aVOr if you're fashion forward, some silk LED tattoos.
p141
aa(lp142
VSo there's versatility, as you see,
p143
aVin the material formats,
p144
aVthat you can do with silk.
p145
aVBut there are still some unique traits.
p146
aVI mean, why would you want to do all these things for real?
p147
aVI mentioned it briefly at the beginning;
p148
aVthe protein is biodegradable and biocompatible.
p149
aVAnd you see here a picture of a tissue section.
p150
aVAnd so what does that mean, that it's biodegradable and biocompatible?
p151
aVYou can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted.
p152
aVWhich means that all the devices that you've seen before and all the formats,
p153
aVin principle, can be implanted and disappear.
p154
aVAnd what you see there in that tissue section,
p155
aVin fact, is you see that reflector tape.
p156
aVSo, much like you're seen at night by a car,
p157
aVthen the idea is that you can see, if you illuminate tissue,
p158
aVyou can see deeper parts of tissue
p159
aVbecause there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk.
p160
aVAnd you see there, it gets reintegrated in tissue.
p161
aVAnd reintegration in the human body
p162
aVis not the only thing,
p163
aVbut reintegration in the environment is important.
p164
aVSo you have a clock, you have protein,
p165
aVand now a silk cup like this
p166
aVcan be thrown away without guilt \u2014
p167
aV(Applause)
p168
aVunlike the polystyrene cups
p169
aVthat unfortunately fill our landfills everyday.
p170
aVIt's edible,
p171
aVso you can do smart packaging around food
p172
aVthat you can cook with the food.
p173
aVIt doesn't taste good,
p174
aVso I'm going to need some help with that.
p175
aa(lp176
VBut probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle.
p177
aVSilk, during its self-assembly process,
p178
aVacts like a cocoon for biological matter.
p179
aVAnd so if you change the recipe,
p180
aVand you add things when you pour \u2014
p181
aVso you add things to your liquid silk solution \u2014
p182
aVwhere these things are enzymes
p183
aVor antibodies or vaccines,
p184
aVthe self-assembly process
p185
aVpreserves the biological function of these dopants.
p186
aVSo it makes the materials environmentally active
p187
aVand interactive.
p188
aVSo that screw that you thought about beforehand
p189
aVcan actually be used
p190
aVto screw a bone together \u2014 a fractured bone together \u2014
p191
aVand deliver drugs at the same,
p192
aVwhile your bone is healing, for example.
p193
aVOr you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge.
p194
aVSo we've made a silk card
p195
aVwith penicillin in it.
p196
aVAnd we stored penicillin at 60 degrees C,
p197
aVso 140 degrees Fahrenheit,
p198
aVfor two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin.
p199
aVAnd so that could be \u2014-
p200
aV(Applause)
p201
aVthat could be potentially a good alternative
p202
aVto solar powered refrigerated camels. (Laughter)
p203
aVAnd of course, there's no use in storage if you can't use [it].
p204
aa(lp205
VAnd so there is this other unique material trait
p206
aVthat these materials have, that they're programmably degradable.
p207
aVAnd so what you see there is the difference.
p208
aVIn the top, you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade,
p209
aVand in the bottom, a film that has been programmed to degrade in water.
p210
aVAnd what you see is that the film on the bottom
p211
aVreleases what is inside it.
p212
aVSo it allows for the recovery of what we've stored before.
p213
aVAnd so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs
p214
aVand for reintegration in the environment
p215
aVin all of these formats that you've seen.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo the thread of discovery that we have really is a thread.
p218
aVWe're impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do,
p219
aVwhether you want to replace a vein or a bone,
p220
aVor maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics,
p221
aVperhaps drink a coffee in a cup
p222
aVand throw it away without guilt,
p223
aVmaybe carry your drugs in your pocket,
p224
aVdeliver them inside your body
p225
aVor deliver them across the desert,
p226
aVthe answer may be in a thread of silk.
p227
aa(lp228
VThank you.
