VLooking deeply inside nature,
p4
aVthrough the magnifying glass of science,
p5
aVdesigners extract principles, processes and materials
p6
aVthat are forming the very basis of design methodology.
p7
aVFrom synthetic constructs that resemble biological materials,
p8
aVto computational methods that emulate neural processes,
p9
aVnature is driving design.
p10
aVDesign is also driving nature.
p11
aVIn realms of genetics, regenerative medicine and synthetic biology,
p12
aVdesigners are growing novel technologies,
p13
aVnot foreseen or anticipated by nature.
p14
aa(lp15
VBionics explores the interplay between biology and design.
p16
aVAs you can see, my legs are bionic.
p17
aVToday, I will tell human stories of bionic integration;
p18
aVhow electromechanics attached to the body, and implanted inside the body
p19
aVare beginning to bridge the gap between disability and ability,
p20
aVbetween human limitation and human potential.
p21
aa(lp22
VBionics has defined my physicality.
p23
aVIn 1982, both of my legs were amputated
p24
aVdue to tissue damage from frostbite,
p25
aVincurred during a mountain-climbing accident.
p26
aVAt that time, I didn't view my body as broken.
p27
aVI reasoned that a human being can never be "broken."
p28
aVTechnology is broken.
p29
aVTechnology is inadequate.
p30
aVThis simple but powerful idea was a call to arms,
p31
aVto advance technology for the elimination of my own disability,
p32
aVand ultimately, the disability of others.
p33
aVI began by developing specialized limbs
p34
aVthat allowed me to return to the vertical world
p35
aVof rock and ice climbing.
p36
aVI quickly realized that the artificial part of my body is malleable;
p37
aVable to take on any form, any function \u2014
p38
aVa blank slate for which to create,
p39
aVperhaps, structures that could extend beyond biological capability.
p40
aVI made my height adjustable.
p41
aVI could be as short as five feet or as tall as I'd like.
p42
aa(lp43
V(Laughter)
p44
aa(lp45
VSo when I was feeling bad about myself,
p46
aVinsecure, I would jack my height up.
p47
aa(lp48
V(Laughter)
p49
aa(lp50
VBut when I was feeling confident and suave,
p51
aVI would knock my height down a notch, just to give the competition a chance.
p52
aa(lp53
V(Laughter)
p54
aa(lp55
V(Applause)
p56
aa(lp57
VNarrow-edged feet allowed me to climb steep rock fissures,
p58
aVwhere the human foot cannot penetrate,
p59
aVand spiked feet enabled me to climb vertical ice walls,
p60
aVwithout ever experiencing muscle leg fatigue.
p61
aVThrough technological innovation,
p62
aVI returned to my sport, stronger and better.
p63
aVTechnology had eliminated my disability,
p64
aVand allowed me a new climbing prowess.
p65
aVAs a young man, I imagined a future world where technology so advanced
p66
aVcould rid the world of disability,
p67
aVa world in which neural implants would allow
p68
aVthe visually impaired to see.
p69
aVA world in which the paralyzed could walk, via body exoskeletons.
p70
aa(lp71
VSadly, because of deficiencies in technology,
p72
aVdisability is rampant in the world.
p73
aVThis gentleman is missing three limbs.
p74
aVAs a testimony to current technology, he is out of the wheelchair,
p75
aVbut we need to do a better job in bionics, to allow, one day, full rehabilitation
p76
aVfor a person with this level of injury.
p77
aVAt the MIT Media Lab, we've established the Center for Extreme Bionics.
p78
aVThe mission of the center is to put forth fundamental science
p79
aVand technological capability
p80
aVthat will allow the biomechatronic and regenerative repair of humans,
p81
aVacross a broad range of brain and body disabilities.
p82
aa(lp83
VToday, I'm going to tell you how my legs function, how they work,
p84
aVas a case in point for this center.
p85
aVNow, I made sure to shave my legs last night,
p86
aVbecause I knew I'd be showing them off.
p87
aa(lp88
V(Laughter)
p89
aa(lp90
VBionics entails the engineering of extreme interfaces.
p91
aVThere's three extreme interfaces in my bionic limbs:
p92
aVmechanical, how my limbs are attached to my biological body;
p93
aVdynamic, how they move like flesh and bone;
p94
aVand electrical, how they communicate with my nervous system.
p95
aa(lp96
VI'll begin with mechanical interface.
p97
aVIn the area of design, we still do not understand
p98
aVhow to attach devices to the body mechanically.
p99
aVIt's extraordinary to me that in this day and age,
p100
aVone of the most mature, oldest technologies
p101
aVin the human timeline, the shoe, still gives us blisters.
p102
aVHow can this be?
p103
aVWe have no idea how to attach things to our bodies.
p104
aVThis is the beautifully lyrical design work
p105
aVof Professor Neri Oxman at the MIT Media Lab,
p106
aVshowing spatially varying exoskeletal impedances,
p107
aVshown here by color variation in this 3D-printed model.
p108
aVImagine a future where clothing is stiff and soft where you need it,
p109
aVwhen you need it, for optimal support and flexibility,
p110
aVwithout ever causing discomfort.
p111
aa(lp112
VMy bionic limbs are attached to my biological body
p113
aVvia synthetic skins with stiffness variations,
p114
aVthat mirror my underlying tissue biomechanics.
p115
aVTo achieve that mirroring, we first developed a mathematical model
p116
aVof my biological limb.
p117
aVTo that end, we used imaging tools such as MRI,
p118
aVto look inside my body,
p119
aVto figure out the geometries and locations of various tissues.
p120
aVWe also took robotic tools \u2014
p121
aVhere's a 14-actuator circle that goes around the biological limb.
p122
aVThe actuators come in, find the surface of the limb,
p123
aVmeasure its unloaded shape,
p124
aVand then they push on the tissues
p125
aVto measure tissue compliances at each anatomical point.
p126
aa(lp127
VWe combine these imaging and robotic data
p128
aVto build a mathematical description of my biological limb, shown on the left.
p129
aVYou see a bunch of points, or nodes?
p130
aVAt each node, there's a color that represents tissue compliance.
p131
aVWe then do a mathematical transformation to the design of the synthetic skin,
p132
aVshown on the right.
p133
aVAnd we've discovered optimality is:
p134
aVwhere the body is stiff, the synthetic skin should be soft,
p135
aVwhere the body is soft, the synthetic skin is stiff,
p136
aVand this mirroring occurs across all tissue compliances.
p137
aVWith this framework, we've produced bionic limbs
p138
aVthat are the most comfortable limbs I've ever worn.
p139
aVClearly, in the future, our clothing, our shoes, our braces, our prostheses,
p140
aVwill no longer be designed and manufactured using artisan strategies,
p141
aVbut rather, data-driven quantitative frameworks.
p142
aVIn that future, our shoes will no longer give us blisters.
p143
aa(lp144
VWe're also embedding sensing and smart materials
p145
aVinto the synthetic skins.
p146
aVThis is a material developed by SRI International, California.
p147
aVUnder electrostatic effect, it changes stiffness.
p148
aVSo under zero voltage, the material is compliant,
p149
aVit's floppy like paper.
p150
aVThen the button's pushed, a voltage is applied,
p151
aVand it becomes stiff as a board.
p152
aa(lp153
V(Tapping sounds)
p154
aa(lp155
VWe embed this material into the synthetic skin
p156
aVthat attaches my bionic limb to my biological body.
p157
aVWhen I walk here, it's no voltage.
p158
aVMy interface is soft and compliant.
p159
aVThe button's pushed, voltage is applied, and it stiffens,
p160
aVoffering me a greater maneuverability over the bionic limb.
p161
aa(lp162
VWe're also building exoskeletons.
p163
aVThis exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft
p164
aVin just the right areas of the running cycle,
p165
aVto protect the biological joints from high impacts and degradation.
p166
aVIn the future, we'll all be wearing exoskeletons
p167
aVin common activities, such as running.
p168
aa(lp169
VNext, dynamic interface.
p170
aVHow do my bionic limbs move like flesh and bone?
p171
aVAt my MIT lab, we study how humans with normal physiologies
p172
aVstand, walk and run.
p173
aVWhat are the muscles doing,
p174
aVand how are they controlled by the spinal cord?
p175
aVThis basic science motivates what we build.
p176
aVWe're building bionic ankles, knees and hips.
p177
aVWe're building body parts from the ground up.
p178
aVThe bionic limbs that I'm wearing are called BiOMs.
p179
aVThey've been fitted to nearly 1,000 patients,
p180
aV400 of which have been wounded U.S. soldiers.
p181
aa(lp182
VHow does it work?
p183
aa(lp184
VAt heel strike, under computer control,
p185
aVthe system controls stiffness,
p186
aVto attenuate the shock of the limb hitting the ground.
p187
aVThen at mid-stance, the bionic limb outputs high torques and powers
p188
aVto lift the person into the walking stride,
p189
aVcomparable to how muscles work in the calf region.
p190
aVThis bionic propulsion is very important clinically to patients.
p191
aVSo on the left, you see the bionic device worn by a lady,
p192
aVon the right, a passive device worn by the same lady,
p193
aVthat fails to emulate normal muscle function,
p194
aVenabling her to do something everyone should be able to do:
p195
aVgo up and down their steps at home.
p196
aVBionics also allows for extraordinary athletic feats.
p197
aVHere's a gentleman running up a rocky pathway.
p198
aVThis is Steve Martin \u2014 not the comedian \u2014
p199
aVwho lost his legs in a bomb blast in Afghanistan.
p200
aa(lp201
VWe're also building exoskeletal structures using these same principles,
p202
aVthat wrap around the biological limb.
p203
aVThis gentleman does not have any leg condition, any disability.
p204
aVHe has a normal physiology,
p205
aVso these exoskeletons are applying muscle-like torques and powers,
p206
aVso that his own muscles need not apply those torques and powers.
p207
aVThis is the first exoskeleton in history that actually augments human walking.
p208
aVIt significantly reduces metabolic cost.
p209
aVIt's so profound in its augmentation,
p210
aVthat when a normal, healthy person wears the device for 40 minutes
p211
aVand then takes it off,
p212
aVtheir own biological legs feel ridiculously heavy and awkward.
p213
aVWe're beginning the age in which machines attached to our bodies
p214
aVwill make us stronger and faster and more efficient.
p215
aa(lp216
VMoving on to electrical interface:
p217
aVHow do my bionic limbs communicate with my nervous system?
p218
aVAcross my residual limb are electrodes
p219
aVthat measure the electrical pulse of my muscles.
p220
aVThat's communicated to the bionic limb,
p221
aVso when I think about moving my phantom limb,
p222
aVthe robot tracks those movement desires.
p223
aVThis diagram shows fundamentally how the bionic limb is controlled.
p224
aVSo we model the missing biological limb,
p225
aVand we've discovered what reflexes occurred,
p226
aVhow the reflexes of the spinal cord are controlling the muscles.
p227
aVAnd that capability is embedded in the chips of the bionic limb.
p228
aVWhat we've done, then, is we modulate the sensitivity of the reflex,
p229
aVthe modeled spinal reflex, with the neural signal,
p230
aVso when I relax my muscles in my residual limb,
p231
aVI get very little torque and power,
p232
aVbut the more I fire my muscles, the more torque I get,
p233
aVand I can even run.
p234
aVAnd that was the first demonstration of a running gait under neural command.
p235
aVFeels great.
p236
aa(lp237
V(Applause)
p238
aa(lp239
VWe want to go a step further.
p240
aVWe want to actually close the loop
p241
aVbetween the human and the bionic external limb.
p242
aVWe're doing experiments
p243
aVwhere we're growing nerves, transected nerves,
p244
aVthrough channels, or micro-channel arrays.
p245
aVOn the other side of the channel,
p246
aVthe nerve then attaches to cells,
p247
aVskin cells and muscle cells.
p248
aVIn the motor channels, we can sense how the person wishes to move.
p249
aVThat can be sent out wirelessly to the bionic limb,
p250
aVthen [sensory information] on the bionic limb
p251
aVcan be converted to stimulations in adjacent channels,
p252
aVsensory channels.
p253
aVSo when this is fully developed and for human use,
p254
aVpersons like myself will not only have
p255
aVsynthetic limbs that move like flesh and bone,
p256
aVbut actually feel like flesh and bone.
p257
aa(lp258
VThis video shows Lisa Mallette,
p259
aVshortly after being fitted with two bionic limbs.
p260
aVIndeed, bionics is making a profound difference in people's lives.
p261
aa(lp262
V(Video) Lisa Mallette: Oh my God.
p263
aVLM: Oh my God, I can't believe it!
p264

VWoman: Now, don't start running.
p270
aa(lp271
VMan: Now turn around, and do the same thing walking up,
p272
aVbut get on your heel to toe, like you would normally just walk on level ground.
p273
aVTry to walk right up the hill.
p274
aa(lp275
VLM: Oh my God.
p276
aa(lp277
VMan: Is it pushing you up?
p278
aa(lp279
VLM: Yes! I'm not even \u2014 I can't even describe it.
p280
aa(lp281
VMan: It's pushing you right up.

aa(lp283
VHugh Herr: Next week, I'm visiting the Center \u2014
p284
aa(lp285
VThank you. Thank you.
p286
aa(lp287
V(Applause)
p288
aa(lp289
VThank you.
p290
aa(lp291
VNext week I'm visiting the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
p292
aVand I'm going to try to convince CMS
p293
aVto grant appropriate code language and pricing,
p294
aVso this technology can be made available to the patients that need it.
p295
aa(lp296
V(Applause)
p297
aa(lp298
VThank you.
p299
aa(lp300
V(Applause)
p301
aa(lp302
VIt's not well appreciated, but over half of the world's population
p303
aVsuffers from some form of cognitive, emotional, sensory or motor condition,
p304
aVand because of poor technology, too often, conditions result in disability
p305
aVand a poorer quality of life.
p306
aVBasic levels of physiological function should be a part of our human rights.
p307
aVEvery person should have the right to live life without disability
p308
aVif they so choose \u2014
p309
aVthe right to live life without severe depression;
p310
aVthe right to see a loved one, in the case of seeing-impaired;
p311
aVor the right to walk or to dance,
p312
aVin the case of limb paralysis or limb amputation.
p313
aVAs a society, we can achieve these human rights,
p314
aVif we accept the proposition that humans are not disabled.
p315
aVA person can never be broken.
p316
aVOur built environment, our technologies,
p317
aVare broken and disabled.
p318
aVWe the people need not accept our limitations,
p319
aVbut can transcend disability through technological innovation.
p320
aVIndeed, through fundamental advances in bionics in this century,
p321
aVwe will set the technological foundation for an enhanced human experience,
p322
aVand we will end disability.
p323
aa(lp324
VI'd like to finish up with one more story, a beautiful story.
p325
aVThe story of Adrianne Haslet-Davis.
p326
aVAdrianne lost her left leg in the Boston terrorist attack.
p327
aVI met Adrianne when this photo was taken, at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.
p328
aVAdrianne is a dancer, a ballroom dancer.
p329
aa(lp330
VAdrianne breathes and lives dance.
p331
aVIt is her expression. It is her art form.
p332
aVNaturally, when she lost her limb in the Boston terrorist attack,
p333
aVshe wanted to return to the dance floor.
p334
aa(lp335
VAfter meeting her and driving home in my car,
p336
aVI thought, I'm an MIT professor. I have resources.
p337
aVLet's build her a bionic limb,
p338
aVto enable her to go back to her life of dance.
p339
aVI brought in MIT scientists with expertise in prosthetics,
p340
aVrobotics, machine learning and biomechanics,
p341
aVand over a 200-day research period, we studied dance.
p342
aVWe brought in dancers with biological limbs,
p343
aVand we studied how they move,
p344
aVwhat forces they apply on the dance floor,
p345
aVand we took those data,
p346
aVand we put forth fundamental principles of dance,
p347
aVreflexive dance capability,
p348
aVand we embedded that intelligence into the bionic limb.
p349
aVBionics is not only about making people stronger and faster.
p350
aVOur expression, our humanity can be embedded into electromechanics.
p351
aa(lp352
VIt was 3.5 seconds between the bomb blasts in the Boston terrorist attack.
p353
aVIn 3.5 seconds, the criminals and cowards took Adrianne off the dance floor.
p354
aVIn 200 days, we put her back.
p355
aVWe will not be intimidated, brought down, diminished, conquered or stopped
p356
aVby acts of violence.
