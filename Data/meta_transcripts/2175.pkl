VHi.
p4
aVToday I'm going to share my personal journey
p5
aVwith female genital mutilation, FGM.
p6
aVFeel free to cry, laugh, cross your legs,
p7
aVor do anything your body feels like doing.
p8
aVI'm not going to name the things your body does.
p9
aa(lp10
VI was born in Sierra Leone.
p11
aVDid anybody watch "Blood Diamond"?
p12
aVIf you have any thoughts \u2014
p13
aVI don't have any diamonds  on me, by the way.
p14
aVIf you have heard of Ebola, well, that's in Sierra Leone as well.
p15
aVI don't have Ebola. You're all safe.
p16
aVDon't rush to the door.
p17
aVBe seated. You're fine. I was checked before I got here.
p18
aa(lp19
VMy grandfather had three wives.
p20
aVDon't ask me why a man needs more than one wife.
p21
aVMen, do you need more than one wife?
p22
aVI don't think so. There you go.
p23
aVHe was looking for a heart attack, that's what I say.
p24
aVOh yeah, he was.
p25
aa(lp26
VWhen I was three, war broke out in Sierra Leone in 1991.
p27
aVI remember literally going to bed one night, everything was good.
p28
aVThe next day, I woke up,
p29
aVbombs were dropping everywhere,
p30
aVand people were trying to kill me and my family.
p31
aVWe escaped the war and ended up in Gambia, in West Africa.
p32
aVEbola is there as well. Stay away from it.
p33
aVWhile we were there as refugees,
p34
aVwe didn't know what was going to become of us.
p35
aVMy mom applied for refugee status.
p36
aVShe's a wonderful, smart woman, that one,
p37
aVand we were lucky.
p38
aVAustralia said, we will take you in.
p39
aVGood job, Aussies.
p40
aa(lp41
VBefore we were meant to travel,
p42
aVmy mom came home one day, and said,
p43
aV"We're going on  a little holiday, a little trip."
p44
aVShe put us in a car,
p45
aVand we drove for hours and ended up in a bush
p46
aVin a remote area in Gambia.
p47
aVIn this bush, we found two huts.
p48
aVAn old lady came towards us.
p49
aVShe was ethnic-looking, very old.
p50
aVShe had a chat with my mom, and went back.
p51
aVThen she came back and walked away from us into a second hut.
p52
aVI'm standing there thinking,
p53
aV"This is very confusing. I don't know what's going on."
p54
aVThe next thing I knew,
p55
aVmy mom took me into this hut.
p56
aVShe took my clothes off,
p57
aVand then she pinned me down on the floor.
p58
aVI struggled and tried to get her off me, but I couldn't.
p59
aVThen the old lady came towards me with a rusty-looking knife,
p60
aVone of the sharp knives,
p61
aVorange-looking, has never seen water or sunlight before.
p62
aVI thought she was going to slaughter me,
p63
aVbut she didn't.
p64
aVShe slowly slid down my body
p65
aVand ended up where my vagina is.
p66
aVShe took hold of what I now know to be my clitoris,
p67
aVshe took that rusty knife, and started cutting away, inch by inch.
p68
aVI screamed, I cried,
p69
aVand asked my mom to get off me so this pain will stop,
p70
aVbut all she did was say, "Be quiet."
p71
aVThis old lady sawed away at my flesh for what felt like forever,
p72
aVand then when she was done,
p73
aVshe threw that piece of flesh across the floor
p74
aVas if it was the most disgusting thing she's ever touched.
p75
aVThey both got off me, and left me there bleeding,
p76
aVcrying, and confused as to what just happened.
p77
aa(lp78
VWe never talked about this again.
p79
aVVery soon, we found that we were coming to Australia,
p80
aVand this is when you had the Sydney Olympics at the time,
p81
aVand people said we were going to the end of the world,
p82
aVthere was nowhere else to go after Australia.
p83
aVYeah, that comforted us a bit.
p84
aVIt took us three days to get here.
p85
aVWe went to Senegal, then France, and then Singapore.
p86
aVWe went to the bathroom to wash our hands.
p87
aVWe spent 15 minutes opening the tap like this.
p88
aVThen somebody came in,
p89
aVslid their hand under and water came out,
p90
aVand we thought, is this what we're in for?
p91
aVLike, seriously.
p92
aa(lp93
VWe got to Adelaide, small place,
p94
aVwhere literally they dumped us in Adelaide, that's what I would say.
p95
aVThey dumped us there.
p96
aVWe were very grateful.
p97
aVWe settled and we liked it.
p98
aVWe were like, "We're home, we're here."
p99
aVThen somebody took us to Rundle Mall.
p100
aVAdelaide has only one mall.
p101
aVIt's this small place.
p102
aVAnd we saw a lot of Asian people.
p103
aVMy mom said all of a sudden, panicking,
p104
aV"You brought us to the wrong place. You must take us back to Australia."
p105
aVYeah. It had to be explained to her that  there were a lot of Asians in Australia
p106
aVand we were in the right place.
p107
aVSo fine, it's all good.
p108
aa(lp109
VMy mom then had this brilliant idea
p110
aVthat I should go to a girls school because they were less racist.
p111
aVI don't know where she read  that publication. (Laughter)
p112
aVNever found evidence of it to this day.
p113
aVSix hundred white kids,  and I was the only black child there.
p114
aVNo, I was the only person with a bit of a color on me.
p115
aVLet me say that. Chocolate color.
p116
aVThere were no Asians, no indigenous.
p117
aVAll we had was some tan girls,
p118
aVgirls who felt the need to be under the sun.
p119
aVIt wasn't the same as my chocolate, though. Not the same.
p120
aVSettling in Australia was quite hard,
p121
aVbut it became harder when I started volunteering for an organization
p122
aVcalled Women's Health Statewide,
p123
aVand I joined their female genital mutilation program
p124
aVwithout any awareness of what this program was actually about,
p125
aVor that it related to me in any way.
p126
aVI spent months educating nurses and doctors
p127
aVabout what female genital mutilation was
p128
aVand where it was practiced:
p129
aVAfrica, the Middle East, Asia, and now, Australia and London and America,
p130
aVbecause, as we all know, we live in a multicultural society,
p131
aVand people who come from those backgrounds come with their culture,
p132
aVand sometimes they have cultural practices that we may not agree with,
p133
aVbut they continue to practice them.
p134
aa(lp135
VOne day, I was looking at the chart
p136
aVof the different types of female genital mutilation,
p137
aVFGM, I will just say FGM for short.
p138
aVType I is when they cut off the hood.
p139
aVType II is when they cut off the whole clitoris
p140
aVand some of your labia majora, or your outer lips,
p141
aVand Type III is when they  cut off the whole clitoris
p142
aVand then they sew you up
p143
aVso you only have a little hole to pee and have your period.
p144
aVMy eyes went onto Type II.
p145
aVBefore all of this, I pretty much had amnesia.
p146
aVI was in so much shock  and traumatized by what had happened,
p147
aVI didn't remember any of it.
p148
aVYes, I was aware something bad happened to me,
p149
aVbut I had no recollection of what had happened.
p150
aVI knew I had a scar down there,
p151
aVbut I thought everybody had a scar down there.
p152
aVThis had happened to everybody else.
p153
aVBut when I looked at Type II, it all came back to me.
p154
aVI remembered what was done to me.
p155
aVI remembered being in that hut
p156
aVwith that old lady and my mom holding me down.
p157
aa(lp158
VWords cannot express the pain I felt,
p159
aVthe confusion that I felt,
p160
aVbecause now I realized that  what was done to me was a terrible thing
p161
aVthat in this society was called barbaric,
p162
aVit was called mutilation.
p163
aVMy mother had said it was called circumcision,
p164
aVbut here it was mutilation.
p165
aVI was thinking, I'm mutilated? I'm a mutilated person.
p166
aVOh my God.
p167
aa(lp168
VAnd then the anger came.
p169
aVI was a black angry woman. (Laughter)
p170
aVOh yeah.
p171
aVA little one, but angry nevertheless.
p172
aVI went home and said to my mom,
p173
aV"You did something."
p174
aVThis is not the African thing to do, pointing at your mother,
p175
aVbut hey, I was ready for any consequences.
p176
aV"You did something to me."
p177
aVShe's like, "What are you talking about, Khadija?"
p178
aVShe's used to me mouthing off.
p179
aVI'm like, "Those years ago, You circumcised me.
p180
aVYou cut away something that belonged to me."
p181
aVShe said, "Yes, I did.
p182
aVI did it for your own good.
p183
aVIt was in your best interest.
p184
aVYour grandmother did it to me, and I did it to you.
p185
aVIt's made you a woman."
p186
aVI'm like, "How?"
p187
aVShe said, "You're empowered, Khadija.
p188
aVDo you get itchy down there?"
p189
aVI'm like, "No, why would I get itchy down there?"
p190
aVShe said, "Well, if you were not circumcised,
p191
aVyou would get itchy down there.
p192
aVWomen who are not circumcised get itchy all the time.
p193
aVThen they sleep around with everybody.
p194
aVYou are not going to sleep around with anybody."
p195
aVAnd I thought,
p196
aVher definition of empowerment was very strange. (Laughter)
p197
aVThat was the end of our first conversation.
p198
aVI went back to school.
p199
aVThese were the days when we had  Dolly and Girlfriend magazines.
p200
aVThere was always the sealed section. Anybody remember those sealed sections?
p201
aVThe naughty bits, you know?
p202
aVOh yeah, I love those. (Laughter)
p203
aVAnyway, there was always an article about pleasure
p204
aVand relationships and, of course, sex.
p205
aVBut it always assumed that you had a clitoris, though,
p206
aVand I thought, this doesn't fit me.
p207
aVThis doesn't talk about people like me.
p208
aVI don't have a clitoris.
p209
aVI watched TV and those women would moan like, "Oh! Oh!"
p210
aVI was like, these people and their damned clitoris.
p211
aV(Laughter)
p212
aVWhat is a woman without a clitoris supposed to do with her life?
p213
aVThat's what I want to know.
p214
aVI want to do that too \u2014 "Oh! Oh!" and all of that.
p215
aVDidn't happen.
p216
aa(lp217
VSo I came home once again and said to my mom,
p218
aV"Dolly and Girlfriend said I deserve pleasure,
p219
aVthat I should be having orgasms,
p220
aVand that white men should figure out how to find the clitoris."
p221
aVApparently, white men have a problem finding the clitoris.
p222
aV(Laughter)
p223
aVJust saying, it wasn't me. It was Dolly that said that.
p224
aVAnd I thought to myself, I had an inner joke in my head
p225
aVthat said, "I will marry a white man.
p226
aVHe won't have that problem with me." (Laughter)
p227
aVSo I said to my mom,
p228
aV"Dolly and Girlfriend said I deserve pleasure, and do you know
p229
aVwhat you have taken away from me, what you have denied me?
p230
aVYou have invaded me in the most sacred way.
p231
aVI want pleasure.
p232
aVI want to get horny, dammit, as well."
p233
aVAnd she said to me, "Who is Dolly and Girlfriend?
p234
aVAre they your new friends, Khadija?"
p235
aVI was like, "No, they're not. That's a magazine, mom, a magazine."
p236
aa(lp237
VShe didn't get it.
p238
aVWe came from two different worlds.
p239
aVWhen she was growing up, not having a clitoris was the norm.
p240
aVIt was celebrated.
p241
aVI was an African Australian girl.
p242
aVI lived in a society that was very clitoris-centric.
p243
aVIt was all about the damn clitoris!
p244
aVAnd I didn't have one!
p245
aVThat pissed me off.
p246
aa(lp247
VSo once I went through this strange phase of anger
p248
aVand pain and confusion,
p249
aVI remember booking an appointment with my therapist.
p250
aVYes, I'm an African  who has a therapist. There you go.
p251
aVAnd I said to her,
p252
aV"I was 13. I was a child.
p253
aVI was settling in a new country,
p254
aVI was dealing with racism and discrimination,
p255
aVEnglish is my third language, and then there it was."
p256
aVI said to her, "I feel like I'm not a woman
p257
aVbecause of what was done to me.
p258
aVI feel incomplete.
p259
aVAm I going to be asexual?"
p260
aVBecause from what I knew about FGM,
p261
aVthe whole aim of it was to control the sexuality of women.
p262
aVIt's so that we don't have any sexual desire.
p263
aVAnd I said, "Am I asexual now?
p264
aVWill I just live the rest of my life not feeling like having sex,
p265
aVnot enjoying sex?"
p266
aVShe couldn't answer my questions,
p267
aVso they went unanswered.
p268
aa(lp269
VWhen I started having my period around the age of 14,
p270
aVI realized I didn't have  normal periods because of FGM.
p271
aVMy periods were heavy, they were long, and they were very painful.
p272
aVThen they told me I had fibroids.
p273
aVThey're like these little balls sitting there.
p274
aVOne was covering one of my ovaries.
p275
aa(lp276
VAnd there came then the big news.
p277
aV"We don't think you can have children, Khadija."
p278
aVAnd once again, I was an angry black woman.
p279
aa(lp280
VI went home and I said to my mom,
p281
aV"Your act, your action, no matter what your may defense may be" \u2014
p282
aVbecause she thought she did it out love \u2014
p283
aV"what you did out of love  is harming me, and it's hurting me.
p284
aVWhat do you have to say for that?"
p285
aVShe said, "I did what I had to do as a mother."
p286
aVI'm still waiting for an apology, by the way.
p287
aa(lp288
VThen I got married.
p289
aVAnd once again \u2014
p290
aVFGM is like the gift that keeps giving.
p291
aVYou figure that out very soon.
p292
aVSex was very painful.
p293
aVIt hurt all the time.
p294
aVAnd of course I realized, they said, "You can't have kids."
p295
aVI thought, "Wow, is this my existence? Is this what life is all about?"
p296
aVI'm proud to tell you,
p297
aVfive months ago,
p298
aVI was told I was pregnant.
p299
aV(Applause)
p300
aa(lp301
VI am the lucky girl.
p302
aVThere are so many women out there who have gone through FGM
p303
aVwho have infertility.
p304
aVI know a nine-year-old girl who has incontinence, constant infections, pain.
p305
aVIt's that gift. It doesn't stop giving.
p306
aVIt affects every area of your life,
p307
aVand this happened to me because I was born a girl
p308
aVin the wrong place.
p309
aVThat's why it happened to me.
p310
aa(lp311
VI channel all that anger,  all that pain, into advocacy
p312
aVbecause I needed my pain to be worth something.
p313
aVSo I'm the director of an organization called No FGM Australia.
p314
aVYou heard me right.
p315
aVWhy No FGM Australia?
p316
aVFGM is in Australia.
p317
aVTwo days ago, I had to call Child Protective Services,
p318
aVbecause somewhere in Australia,
p319
aVthere's a four-year old
p320
aVthere's a four-year-old whose mom  is planning on performing FGM on her.
p321
aVThat child is in kindy. I'll let that sink in: four years old.
p322
aVA couple of months ago, I met a lady who is married to a Malaysian man.
p323
aVHer husband came home one day and said he was going to take their daughters
p324
aVback to Malaysia to cut off their clitoris.
p325
aVAnd she said, "Why?" He said they were dirty.
p326
aVAnd she said, "Well, you married me."
p327
aVHe said, "Oh, this is my cultural belief."
p328
aVThey then went into a whole discussion where she said to him,
p329
aV"Over my dead body will you do that to my daughters."
p330
aVBut imagine if this woman wasn't aware of what FGM was,
p331
aVif they never had that conversation?
p332
aVHer children would have been flown over to Malaysia
p333
aVand they would have come back changed for the rest of their lives.
p334
aVDo you know the millions of dollars
p335
aVit would take us to deal with an issue like that?
p336
aV[Three children per day] in Australia
p337
aVare at risk of having FGM performed on them.
p338
aVThis is an Australian problem, people.
p339
aVIt's not an African problem. It's not a Middle Eastern problem.
p340
aVIt's not white, it's not black, it has no color, it's everybody's problem.
p341
aVFGM is child abuse.
p342
aVIt's violence against women.
p343
aVIt's saying that women don't have a right to sexual pleasure.
p344
aVIt says we don't have a right to our bodies.
p345
aVWell, I say no to that, and you know what? Bullshit.
p346
aVThat's what I have to say to that.
p347
aV(Applause)
p348
aa(lp349
VI am proud to say that I'm doing my part in ending FGM.
p350
aVWhat are you going to do?
p351
aVThere may be a child in your classroom who is at risk of FGM.
p352
aVThere may be a patient who comes to your hospital
p353
aVwho is at risk of FGM.
p354
aVBut this is the reality,
p355
aVthat even in our beloved Australia,
p356
aVthe most wonderful place in the world,
p357
aVchildren are being abused because of a culture.
p358
aVCulture should not be a defense for child abuse.
p359
aVI want ever single one of you to see FGM as an issue for you.
p360
aVMake it personal.
p361
aVIt could be your daughter, your sister, your cousin.
p362
aa(lp363
VI can't fight FGM alone.
p364
aVI could try, but I can't.
p365
aVSo my appeal to you is, please join me.
p366
aVSign my petition on Change.org
p367
aVand type in Khadija, my name, and it'll come up, and sign it.
p368
aVThe aim of that is to get support for FGM victims in Australia
p369
aVand to protect little girls growing up here
p370
aVto not have this evil done to them,
p371
aVbecause every child has a right to pleasure.
p372
aVEvery child has a right to their bodies being left intact,
p373
aVand dammit, ever child has a right to a clitoris.
p374
aVSo please join me in ending this act.
p375
aa(lp376
VMy favorite quote is,
p377
aV"All it takes for evil to prevail
p378
aVis for a few good men and women to do nothing."
p379
aVAre you going to let this evil of female genital mutilation
p380
aVto prevail in Australia?
p381
aVI don't think so,
p382
aVso please join me in ensuring that it ends in my generation.
p383
aa(lp384
VThank you.
