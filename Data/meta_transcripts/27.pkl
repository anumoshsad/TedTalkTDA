VMy name is Lovegrove.
p4
aVI only know nine Lovegroves, two of which are my parents.
p5
aVThey are first cousins, and you know what happens when, you know \u2014
p6
aa(lp7
V(Laughter)
p8
aa(lp9
VSo there's a terribly weird freaky side to me,
p10
aVwhich I'm fighting with all the time.
p11
aVSo to try and get through today,
p12
aVI've kind of disciplined myself with an 18-minute talk.
p13
aVI was hanging on to have a pee.
p14
aVI thought perhaps if I was hanging on long enough,
p15
aVthat would guide me through the 18 minutes.
p16
aa(lp17
V(Laughter)
p18
aa(lp19
VOK. I am known as Captain Organic
p20
aVand that's a philosophical position as well as an aesthetic position.
p21
aVBut today what I'd like to talk to you about is that love of form
p22
aVand how form can touch people's soul and emotion.
p23
aVNot very long ago, not many thousands of years ago,
p24
aVwe actually lived in caves,
p25
aVand I don't think we've lost that coding system.
p26
aVWe respond so well to form.
p27
aVBut I'm interested in creating intelligent form.
p28
aVI'm not interested at all in blobism
p29
aVor any of that superficial rubbish that you see coming out as design.
p30
aVThis artificially induced consumerism \u2014 I think it's atrocious.
p31
aa(lp32
VMy world is the world of people like Amory Lovins,
p33
aVJanine Benyus, James Watson.
p34
aVI'm in that world, but I work purely instinctively.
p35
aVI'm not a scientist. I could have been, perhaps,
p36
aVbut I work in this world where I trust my instincts.
p37
aVSo I am a 21st-century translator of technology
p38
aVinto products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with.
p39
aVAnd we should be developing things \u2014 we should be developing packaging
p40
aVfor ideas which elevate people's perceptions
p41
aVand respect for the things that we dig out of the earth
p42
aVand translate into products for everyday use.
p43
aVSo, the water bottle.
p44
aa(lp45
VI'll begin with this concept of what I call DNA.
p46
aVDNA: Design, Nature, Art.
p47
aVThese are the three things that condition my world.
p48
aVHere is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci, 500 years ago, before photography.
p49
aVIt shows how observation, curiosity and instinct
p50
aVwork to create amazing art.
p51
aVIndustrial design is the art form of the 21st century.
p52
aVPeople like Leonardo \u2014 there have not been many \u2014
p53
aVhad this amazingly instinctive curiosity.
p54
aVI work from a similar position.
p55
aVI don't want to sound pretentious saying that,
p56
aVbut this is my drawing made on a digital pad a couple of years ago \u2014
p57
aVwell into the 21st century, 500 years later.
p58
aVIt's my impression of water.
p59
aVImpressionism being the most valuable art form on the planet as we know it:
p60
aV100 million dollars, easily, for a Monet.
p61
aa(lp62
VI use, now, a whole new process.
p63
aVA few years ago I reinvented my process
p64
aVto keep up with people like Greg Lynn, Thom Mayne, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas \u2014
p65
aVall these people that I think are persevering and pioneering
p66
aVwith fantastic new ideas of how to create form.
p67
aVThis is all created digitally.
p68
aVHere you see the machining, the milling of a block of acrylic.
p69
aVThis is what I show to the client to say, "That's what I want to do."
p70
aVAt that point, I don't know if that's possible at all.
p71
aVIt's a seductor, but I just feel in my bones that that's possible.
p72
aa(lp73
VSo we go, we look at the tooling.
p74
aVWe look at how that is produced.
p75
aVThese are the invisible things that you never see in your life.
p76
aVThis is the background noise of industrial design.
p77
aVThat is like an Anish Kapoor flowing through a Richard Serra.
p78
aVIt is more valuable than the product in my eyes.
p79
aVI don't have one.
p80
aVWhen I do make some money, I'll have one machined for myself.
p81
aVThis is the final product.
p82
aVWhen they sent it to me, I thought I'd failed.
p83
aVIt felt like nothing. It has to feel like nothing.
p84
aVIt was when I put the water in
p85
aVthat I realized that I'd put a skin on water itself.
p86
aVIt's an icon of water itself,
p87
aVand it elevates people's perception of contemporary design.
p88
aVEach bottle is different,
p89
aVmeaning the water level will give you a different shape.
p90
aVIt's mass individualism from a single product.
p91
aVIt fits the hand.
p92
aVIt fits arthritic hands. It fits children's hands.
p93
aVIt makes the product strong, the tessellation.
p94
aVIt's a millefiori of ideas.
p95
aVIn the future, they will look like that,
p96
aVbecause we need to move away from those type of polymers
p97
aVand use that for medical equipment
p98
aVand more important things, perhaps, in life.
p99
aVBiopolymers, these new ideas for materials,
p100
aVwill come into play in probably a decade.
p101
aVIt doesn't look as cool, does it?
p102
aVBut I can live up to that. I don't have a problem with that.
p103
aVI design for that condition, biopolymers. It's the future.
p104
aa(lp105
VI took this video in Cape Town last year.
p106
aVThis is the freaky side coming out.
p107
aVI have this special interest in things like this, which blow my mind.
p108
aVI don't know whether to, you know, drop to my knees, cry;
p109
aVI don't know what I think.
p110
aVBut I just know that nature \u2014
p111
aVnature improves with ever-greater purpose
p112
aVthat which once existed,
p113
aVand that strangeness is a consequence of innovative thinking.
p114
aVWhen I look at these things, they look pretty normal to me.
p115
aVBut these things evolved over many years, and what we're trying to do \u2014
p116
aVI get three weeks to design a telephone. How the hell do I do that,
p117
aVwhen you get these things that take hundreds of millions of years to evolve?
p118
aVHow do you condense that?
p119
aa(lp120
VIt comes back to instinct.
p121
aVI'm not talking about designing telephones that look like that
p122
aVand I'm not looking at designing architecture like that.
p123
aVI'm just interested in natural growth patterns
p124
aVand the beautiful forms that only nature really creates.
p125
aVHow that flows through me and how that comes out
p126
aVis what I'm trying to understand.
p127
aa(lp128
VThis is a scan through the human forearm.
p129
aVIt's then blown up through rapid prototyping
p130
aVto reveal its cellular structure.
p131
aVI have these in my office.
p132
aVMy office is a mixture of the Natural History Museum
p133
aVand a NASA space lab.
p134
aVIt's a weird, kind of freaky place.
p135
aVThis is one of my specimens.
p136
aa(lp137
VThis is made \u2014
p138
aVbone is made from a mixture of inorganic minerals and polymers.
p139
aVI studied cooking in school for four years, and in that experience,
p140
aVwhich was called "domestic science,"
p141
aVit was a bit of a cheap trick for me to try and get a science qualification.
p142
aa(lp143
V(Laughter)
p144
aa(lp145
VActually, I put marijuana in everything I cooked \u2014
p146
aa(lp147
V(Laughter)
p148
aa(lp149
VAnd I had access to all the best girls. It was fabulous.
p150
aVAll the guys in the rugby team couldn't understand.
p151
aVAnyway \u2014 this is a meringue.
p152
aVThis is another sample I have.
p153
aVA meringue is made exactly the same way, in my estimation, as a bone.
p154
aVIt's made from polysaccharides and proteins.
p155
aVIf you pour water on that, it dissolves.
p156
aVCould we be manufacturing from foodstuffs in the future?
p157
aVNot a bad idea. I don't know.
p158
aVI need to talk to Janine and a few other people about that,
p159
aVbut I believe instinctively that that meringue can become something,
p160
aVa car \u2014 I don't know.
p161
aa(lp162
VI'm also interested in growth patterns:
p163
aVthe unbridled way that nature grows things
p164
aVso you're not restricted by form at all.
p165
aVThese interrelated forms, they do inspire everything I do,
p166
aValthough I might end up making something incredibly simple.
p167
aVThis is a detail of a chair that I've designed in magnesium.
p168
aVIt shows this interlocution of elements and the beauty of, kind of, engineering
p169
aVand biological thinking,
p170
aVshown pretty much as a bone structure.
p171
aVAny one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall
p172
aVas some kind of art object.
p173
aa(lp174
VIt's the world's first chair made in magnesium.
p175
aVIt cost 1.7 million dollars to develop.
p176
aVIt's called "Go," by Bernhardt, USA.
p177
aVIt went into Time magazine in 2001 as the new language of the 21st century.
p178
aVBoy. For somebody growing up in Wales in a little village, that's enough.
p179
aVIt shows how you make one holistic form, like the car industry,
p180
aVand then you break up what you need.
p181
aVThis is an absolutely beautiful way of working.
p182
aVIt's a godly way of working.
p183
aVIt's organic and it's essential.
p184
aVIt's an absolutely fat-free design,
p185
aVand when you look at it, you see human beings.
p186
aa(lp187
VWhen that moves into polymers,
p188
aVyou can change the elasticity, the fluidity of the form.
p189
aVThis is an idea for a gas-injected, one-piece polymer chair.
p190
aVWhat nature does is it drills holes in things.
p191
aVIt liberates form.
p192
aVIt takes away anything extraneous.
p193
aVThat's what I do.
p194
aVI make organic things which are essential.
p195
aVAnd they look funky, too \u2014 but I don't set out to make funky things
p196
aVbecause I think that's an absolute disgrace.
p197
aa(lp198
VI set out to look at natural forms.
p199
aVIf you took the idea of fractal technology further, take a membrane,
p200
aVshrinking it down constantly like nature does \u2014
p201
aVthat could be a seat for a chair.
p202
aVIt could be a sole for a sports shoe.
p203
aVIt could be a car blending into seats.
p204
aVWow. Let's go for it. That's the kind of stuff.
p205
aVThis is what exists in nature.
p206
aVObservation now allows us to bring that natural process
p207
aVinto the design process every day.
p208
aVThat's what I do.
p209
aa(lp210
VThis is a show that's currently on in Tokyo.
p211
aVIt's called "Superliquidity." It's my sculptural investigation.
p212
aVIt's like 21st-century Henry Moore.
p213
aVWhen you see a Henry Moore, still, your hair stands up.
p214
aVThere's some amazing spiritual connect.
p215
aVIf he was a car designer, phew, we'd all be driving one.
p216
aVIn his day, he was the highest taxpayer in Britain.
p217
aa(lp218
VThat is the power of organic design.
p219
aVIt contributes immensely to our \u2014
p220
aVsense of being,
p221
aVour sense of relationships with things,
p222
aVour sensuality and, you know, the sort of \u2014
p223
aVeven the sort of socio-erotic side, which is very important.
p224
aVThis is my artwork. This is all my process.
p225
aVThese actually are sold as artwork. They're very big prints.
p226
aVBut this is how I get to that object.
p227
aa(lp228
VIronically, that object was made by the Killarney process,
p229
aVwhich is a brand-new process here for the 21st century,
p230
aVand I can hear Greg Lynn laughing his socks off as I say that.
p231
aVI'll tell you about that later.
p232
aa(lp233
VWhen I look into these data images,
p234
aVI see new things.
p235
aVIt's self-inspired.
p236
aVDiatomic structures, radiolaria,
p237
aVthe things that we couldn't see but we can do now \u2014
p238
aVthese, again, are cored out.
p239
aVThey're made virtually from nothing. They're made from silica.
p240
aVWhy not structures from cars like that?
p241
aVCoral, all these natural forces,
p242
aVtake away what they don't need and they deliver maximum beauty.
p243
aVWe need to be in that realm.
p244
aVI want to do stuff like that.
p245
aa(lp246
VThis is a new chair which should come on the market in September.
p247
aVIt's for a company called Moroso in Italy. It's a gas-injected polymer chair.
p248
aVThose holes you see there are very filtered-down,
p249
aVwatered-down versions of the extremity of the diatomic structures.
p250
aVIt goes with the flow of the polymer and you'll see \u2014
p251
aVthere's an image coming up right now that shows the full thing.
p252
aVIt's great to have companies in Italy who support this way of dreaming.
p253
aVIf you see the shadows that come through that,
p254
aVthey're actually probably more important than the product,
p255
aVbut it's the minimum it takes.
p256
aVThe coring out of the back lets you breathe.
p257
aVIt takes away any material you don't need
p258
aVand it actually garners flexure too.
p259
aa(lp260
VI was going to break into a dance then.
p261
aa(lp262
VThis is some current work I'm doing.
p263
aVI'm looking at single-surface structures
p264
aVand how they stretch and flow.
p265
aVIt's based on furniture typologies, but that's not the end motivation.
p266
aVIt's made from aluminum ...
p267
aVas opposed to aluminium, and it's grown.
p268
aVIt's grown in my mind,
p269
aVand then it's grown in terms of the whole process that I go through.
p270
aa(lp271
VThis is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry, who build parts for Bentleys and so on.
p272
aVIt's being built as we speak
p273
aVand it will be on show in Phillips next year in New York.
p274
aVI have a big show with Phillips Auctioneers.
p275
aVWhen I see these animations, oh Jesus, I'm blown away.
p276
aVThis is what goes on in my studio everyday.
p277
aVI walk \u2014 I'm traveling. I come back.
p278
aVSome guy's got that on a computer \u2014 there's this like, oh my goodness.
p279
aVSo I try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio.
p280
aVThis kind of effervescent \u2014
p281
aVfully charged sense of soup that delivers ideas.
p282
aa(lp283
VSingle-surface products.
p284
aVFurniture's a good one.
p285
aVHow you grow legs out of a surface.
p286
aVI would love to build this one day
p287
aVand perhaps I'd like to build it also out of flour, sugar,
p288
aVpolymer, wood chips \u2014 I don't know, human hair.
p289
aVI don't know. I'd love a go at that. I don't know. If I just got some time.
p290
aVThat's the weird side coming out again. A lot of companies don't understand that.
p291
aa(lp292
VThree weeks ago I was with Sony in Tokyo.
p293
aVThey said, "Give us the dream. What is our dream? How do we beat Apple?"
p294
aVI said, "You don't copy Apple, that's for sure.
p295
aVYou get into biopolymers."
p296
aVThey looked straight through me.
p297
aVWhat a waste. Anyway.
p298
aa(lp299
V(Laughter)
p300
aa(lp301
VNo, it's true. Fuck them. You know, I mean \u2014
p302
aa(lp303
V(Laughter)
p304
aa(lp305
VI'm delivering; they're not taking.
p306
aVI've had this image 20 years.
p307
aVI've had this image of a water droplet for 20 years, sitting on a hot bed.
p308
aVThat is an image of a car for me.
p309
aVThat's the car of the future. It's a water droplet.
p310
aVI've been banging on about this like I can't believe.
p311
aVCars are all wrong.
p312
aa(lp313
VI'm going to show you something a bit weird now.
p314
aVThey laughed everywhere over the world I showed this.
p315
aVThe only place that didn't laugh was Moscow.
p316
aVCars are made from 30,000 components.
p317
aVHow ridiculous is that? Couldn't you make that from 300?
p318
aVIt's got a vacuum-formed, carbon-nylon pan.
p319
aVEverything's holistically integrated. It opens and closes like a bread bin.
p320
aVThere is no engine. There's a solar panel on the back
p321
aVand there are batteries in the wheels; they're fitted like Formula 1.
p322
aVYou take them off your wall, you plug them in. Off you go.
p323
aVA three-wheeled car: slow, feminine,
p324
aVtransparent, so you can see the people in there.
p325
aVYou drive different.
p326
aVYou see that thing. You do. You do.
p327
aVAnd not anesthetized, separated from life.
p328
aVThere's a hole at the front and there's a reason for that.
p329
aVIt's a city car. You drive along. You get out.
p330
aVYou drive on to a proboscis. You get out.
p331
aVIt lifts you up.
p332
aVIt presents the solar panel to the sun, and at night, it's a street lamp.
p333
aa(lp334
V(Applause)
p335
aa(lp336
VThat's what happens if you get inspired by the street lamp first,
p337
aVand do the car second.
p338
aVI can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages,
p339
aVfloating around on the ground, driven by AI.
p340
aVWhen I showed this in South Africa,
p341
aVeverybody afterwards was going, "Hey, car on a stick. Like this."
p342
aVCan you imagine? A car on a stick.
p343
aa(lp344
V(Laughter)
p345
aa(lp346
VIf you put it next to contemporary architecture,
p347
aVit feels totally natural to me.
p348
aVAnd that's what I do with my furniture.
p349
aVI'm not putting Charles Eames' furniture in buildings anymore.
p350
aVI'm trying to build furniture which fits architecture.
p351
aVI'm trying to build transportation systems.
p352
aVI work on aircraft for Airbus,
p353
aVI do all this sort of stuff
p354
aVtrying to force these natural, inspired-by-nature dreams home.
p355
aa(lp356
VI'm going to finish on two things.
p357
aVThis is the stereolithography of a staircase.
p358
aVIt's a little bit of a dedication to James, James Watson.
p359
aVI built this thing for my studio.
p360
aVIt cost me 250,000 dollars to build this.
p361
aVMost people go and buy the Aston Martin.
p362
aVI built this.
p363
aVThis is the data that goes with that. Incredibly complex.
p364
aVTook about two years, because I'm looking for fat-free design.
p365
aVLean, efficient things. Healthy products.
p366
aVThis is built by composites.
p367
aVIt's a single element which rotates around to create a holistic element,
p368
aVand this is a carbon-fiber handrail which is only supported in two places.
p369
aVModern materials allow us to do modern things.
p370
aa(lp371
VThis is a shot in the studio.
p372
aVThis is how it looks pretty much every day.
p373
aVYou wouldn't want to have a fear of heights coming down it.
p374
aVThere is virtually no handrail. It doesn't pass any standards.
p375
aa(lp376
V(Laughter)
p377
aa(lp378
VWho cares?
p379
aa(lp380
V(Laughter)
p381
aa(lp382
VAnd it has an internal handrail which gives it its strength.
p383
aVIt's this holistic integration. That's my studio. It's subterranean.
p384
aVIt's in Notting Hill, next to all the crap \u2014
p385
aVthe prostitutes and all that stuff.
p386
aVIt's next to David Hockney's original studio.
p387
aVIt has a lighting system that changes throughout the day.
p388
aVMy guys go out for lunch. The door's open. They come back in,
p389
aVbecause it's normally raining and they prefer to stay in.
p390
aa(lp391
VThis is my studio.
p392
aVElephant skull from Oxford University, 1988.
p393
aVI bought that last year. They're very difficult to find.
p394
aVIf anybody's got a whale skeleton they want to sell me,
p395
aVI'll put it in the studio.
p396
aa(lp397
VSo I'm just going to interject a little bit
p398
aVwith some of the things that you'll see in the video.
p399
aVIt's a homemade video, made it myself at three o'clock in the morning
p400
aVjust to show you how my real world is.
p401
aVYou never see that.
p402
aVYou never see architects or designers showing you their real world.
p403
aa(lp404
VThis is called a "Plasnet."
p405
aVIt's a new bio-polycarbonate chair I'm doing in Italy.
p406
aa(lp407
VWorld's first bamboo bike with folding handlebars.
p408
aVWe should all be riding one of these.
p409
aVAs China buys all these crappy cars, we should be riding things like this.
p410
aVCounterbalance.
p411
aa(lp412
VLike I say, it's a cross
p413
aVbetween Natural History Museum and a NASA laboratory.
p414
aVIt's full of prototypes and objects.
p415
aVIt's self-inspirational, again.
p416
aVI mean, the rare times when I'm there,
p417
aVI do enjoy it.
p418
aVAnd I get lots and lots of kids coming.
p419
aVI'm a contaminator for all those children of investment bankers \u2014 wankers.
p420
aVSorry.
p421
aa(lp422
V(Laughter)
p423
aa(lp424
VThat's a solar seed. It's a concept for new architecture.
p425
aVThat thing on the top is the world's first solar-powered garden lamp \u2014
p426
aVthe first produced.
p427
aVGiles Revell should be talking here today \u2014
