VI wanted to talk to you today about creative confidence.
p4
aVI'm going to start way back in the third grade
p5
aVat Oakdale School in Barberton, Ohio.
p6
aa(lp7
VI remember one day my best friend Brian was working on a project.
p8
aVHe was making a horse out of the clay our teacher kept under the sink.
p9
aVAnd at one point, one of the girls that was sitting at his table,
p10
aVseeing what he was doing, leaned over and said to him,
p11
aV"That's terrible. That doesn't look anything like a horse."
p12
aVAnd Brian's shoulders sank.
p13
aVAnd he wadded up the clay horse and he threw it back in the bin.
p14
aVI never saw Brian do a project like that ever again.
p15
aa(lp16
VAnd I wonder how often that happens, you know?
p17
aVIt seems like when I tell that story of Brian to my class,
p18
aVa lot of them want to come up after class
p19
aVand tell me about their similar experience,
p20
aVhow a teacher shut them down,
p21
aVor how a student was particularly cruel to them.
p22
aVAnd then some kind of opt out of thinking of themselves as creative
p23
aVat that point.
p24
aVAnd I see that opting out that happens in childhood,
p25
aVand it moves in and becomes more ingrained, even,
p26
aVby the time you get to adult life.
p27
aa(lp28
VSo we see a lot of this.
p29
aVWhen we have a workshop
p30
aVor when we have clients in to work with us side by side,
p31
aVeventually we get to the point in the process
p32
aVthat's kind of fuzzy or unconventional.
p33
aVAnd eventually, these big-shot executives whip out their BlackBerrys
p34
aVand they say they have to make really important phone calls,
p35
aVand they head for the exits.
p36
aVAnd they're just so uncomfortable.
p37
aVWhen we track them down and ask them what's going on,
p38
aVthey say something like, "I'm just not the creative type."
p39
aVBut we know that's not true.
p40
aVIf they stick with the process, if they stick with it,
p41
aVthey end up doing amazing things.
p42
aVAnd they surprise themselves at just how innovative
p43
aVthey and their teams really are.
p44
aa(lp45
VSo I've been looking at this fear of judgment that we have,
p46
aVthat you don't do things, you're afraid you're going to be judged;
p47
aVif you don't say the right creative thing, you're going to be judged.
p48
aVAnd I had a major breakthrough,
p49
aVwhen I met the psychologist Albert Bandura.
p50
aa(lp51
VI don't know if you know Albert Bandura, but if you go to Wikipedia,
p52
aVit says that he's the fourth most important psychologist in history \u2014
p53
aVyou know, like Freud, Skinner, somebody and Bandura.
p54
aa(lp55
V(Laughter)
p56
aa(lp57
VBandura is 86 and he still works at Stanford.
p58
aVAnd he's just a lovely guy.
p59
aa(lp60
VSo I went to see him,
p61
aVbecause he's just worked on phobias for a long time,
p62
aVwhich I'm very interested in.
p63
aVHe had developed this way,
p64
aVthis, kind of, methodology,
p65
aVthat ended up curing people in a very short amount of time,
p66
aVlike, in four hours.
p67
aVHe had a huge cure rate of people who had phobias.
p68
aVAnd we talked about snakes \u2014 I don't know why \u2014
p69
aVwe talked about snakes and fear of snakes as a phobia.
p70
aa(lp71
VAnd it was really enjoyable, really interesting.
p72
aVHe told me that he'd invite the test subject in,
p73
aVand he'd say, "You know, there's a snake in the next room
p74
aVand we're going to go in there."
p75
aVTo which, he reported, most of them replied,
p76
aV"Hell no! I'm not going in there, certainly if there's a snake in there."
p77
aa(lp78
VBut Bandura has a step-by-step process that was super successful.
p79
aVSo he'd take people to this two-way mirror
p80
aVlooking into the room where the snake was.
p81
aVAnd he'd get them comfortable with that.
p82
aVThen through a series of steps,
p83
aVhe'd move them and they'd be standing in the doorway with the door open,
p84
aVand they'd be looking in there.
p85
aVAnd he'd get them comfortable with that.
p86
aVAnd then many more steps later, baby steps,
p87
aVthey'd be in the room, they'd have a leather glove like a welder's glove on,
p88
aVand they'd eventually touch the snake.
p89
aVAnd when they touched the snake, everything was fine. They were cured.
p90
aVIn fact, everything was better than fine.
p91
aVThese people who had lifelong fears of snakes
p92
aVwere saying things like,
p93
aV"Look how beautiful that snake is."
p94
aVAnd they were holding it in their laps.
p95
aa(lp96
VBandura calls this process "guided mastery."
p97
aVI love that term: guided mastery.
p98
aVAnd something else happened.
p99
aVThese people who went through the process and touched the snake
p100
aVended up having less anxiety about other things in their lives.
p101
aVThey tried harder, they persevered longer,
p102
aVand they were more resilient in the face of failure.
p103
aVThey just gained a new confidence.
p104
aVAnd Bandura calls that confidence "self-efficacy,"
p105
aVthe sense that you can change the world
p106
aVand that you can attain what you set out to do.
p107
aa(lp108
VWell, meeting Bandura was really cathartic for me,
p109
aVbecause I realized that this famous scientist
p110
aVhad documented and scientifically validated
p111
aVsomething that we've seen happen for the last 30 years:
p112
aVthat we could take people who had the fear that they weren't creative,
p113
aVand we could take them through a series of steps,
p114
aVkind of like a series of small successes,
p115
aVand they turn fear into familiarity.
p116
aVAnd they surprise themselves.
p117
aVThat transformation is amazing.
p118
aa(lp119
VWe see it at the d.school all the time.
p120
aVPeople from all different kinds of disciplines,
p121
aVthey think of themselves as only analytical.
p122
aVAnd they come in and they go through the process, our process,
p123
aVthey build confidence and now they think of themselves differently.
p124
aVAnd they're totally emotionally excited about the fact that they walk around
p125
aVthinking of themselves as a creative person.
p126
aa(lp127
VSo I thought one of the things I'd do today
p128
aVis take you through and show you what this journey looks like.
p129
aVTo me, that journey looks like Doug Dietz.
p130
aVDoug Dietz is a technical person.
p131
aVHe designs large medical imaging equipment.
p132
aVHe's worked for GE, and he's had a fantastic career.
p133
aVBut at one point, he had a moment of crisis.
p134
aa(lp135
VHe was in the hospital looking at one of his MRI machines in use,
p136
aVwhen he saw a young family, and this little girl.
p137
aVAnd that little girl was crying and was terrified.
p138
aVAnd Doug was really disappointed to learn
p139
aVthat nearly 80 percent of the pediatric patients in this hospital
p140
aVhad to be sedated in order to deal with his MRI machine.
p141
aVAnd this was really disappointing to Doug,
p142
aVbecause before this time, he was proud of what he did.
p143
aVHe was saving lives with this machine.
p144
aVBut it really hurt him to see the fear that this machine caused in kids.
p145
aa(lp146
VAbout that time, he was at the d.school at Stanford taking classes.
p147
aVHe was learning about our process, about design thinking, about empathy,
p148
aVabout iterative prototyping.
p149
aVAnd he would take this new knowledge and do something quite extraordinary.
p150
aVHe would redesign the entire experience
p151
aVof being scanned.
p152
aVAnd this is what he came up with.
p153
aa(lp154
V(Laughter)
p155
aa(lp156
VHe turned it into an adventure for the kids.
p157
aVHe painted the walls and he painted the machine,
p158
aVand he got the operators retrained by people who know kids,
p159
aVlike children's museum people.
p160
aVAnd now when the kid comes, it's an experience.
p161
aVAnd they talk to them about the noise and the movement of the ship.
p162
aVAnd when they come, they say,
p163
aV"OK, you're going to go into the pirate ship,
p164
aVbut be very still, because we don't want the pirates to find you."
p165
aa(lp166
VAnd the results were super dramatic:
p167
aVfrom something like 80 percent of the kids needing to be sedated,
p168
aVto something like 10 percent of the kids needing to be sedated.
p169
aVAnd the hospital and GE were happy, too,
p170
aVbecause you didn't have to call the anesthesiologist all the time,
p171
aVand they could put more kids through the machine in a day.
p172
aVSo the quantitative results were great.
p173
aVBut Doug's results that he cared about were much more qualitative.
p174
aVHe was with one of the mothers
p175
aVwaiting for her child to come out of the scan.
p176
aVAnd when the little girl came out of her scan,
p177
aVshe ran up to her mother and said,
p178
aV"Mommy, can we come back tomorrow?"
p179
aa(lp180
V(Laughter)
p181
aa(lp182
VAnd so, I've heard Doug tell the story many times
p183
aVof his personal transformation
p184
aVand the breakthrough design that happened from it,
p185
aVbut I've never really seen him tell the story of the little girl
p186
aVwithout a tear in his eye.
p187
aa(lp188
VDoug's story takes place in a hospital.
p189
aVI know a thing or two about hospitals.
p190
aVA few years ago, I felt a lump on the side of my neck.
p191
aVIt was my turn in the MRI machine.
p192
aVIt was cancer, it was the bad kind.
p193
aVI was told I had a 40 percent chance of survival.
p194
aa(lp195
VSo while you're sitting around with the other patients,
p196
aVin your pajamas,
p197
aVand everybody's pale and thin \u2014
p198
aa(lp199
V(Laughter)
p200
aa(lp201
Vyou know? \u2014 and you're waiting for your turn to get the gamma rays,
p202
aVyou think of a lot of things.
p203
aVMostly, you think about: Am I going to survive?
p204
aVAnd I thought a lot about:
p205
aVWhat was my daughter's life going to be like without me?
p206
aVBut you think about other things.
p207
aVI thought a lot about: What was I put on Earth to do?
p208
aVWhat was my calling? What should I do?
p209
aVI was lucky because I had lots of options.
p210
aVWe'd been working in health and wellness,
p211
aVand K-12, and the developing world.
p212
aVso there were lots of projects that I could work on.
p213
aVBut then I decided and committed at this point,
p214
aVto the thing I most wanted to do,
p215
aVwhich was to help as many people as possible
p216
aVregain the creative confidence they lost along their way.
p217
aVAnd if I was going to survive, that's what I wanted to do.
p218
aVI survived, just so you know.
p219
aa(lp220
V(Laughter)
p221
aa(lp222
V(Applause)
p223
aa(lp224
VI really believe that when people gain this confidence \u2014
p225
aVand we see it all the time at the d.school and at IDEO \u2014
p226
aVthat they actually start working on the things
p227
aVthat are really important in their lives.
p228
aVWe see people quit what they're doing and go in new directions.
p229
aVWe see them come up with more interesting \u2014 and just more \u2014 ideas,
p230
aVso they can choose from better ideas.
p231
aVAnd they just make better decisions.
p232
aa(lp233
VI know at TED, you're supposed to have a change-the-world kind of thing,
p234
aVisn't that \u2014 everybody has a change-the-world thing?
p235
aVIf there is one for me, this is it, to help this happen.
p236
aVSo I hope you'll join me on my quest,
p237
aVyou as, kind of, thought leaders.
p238
aVIt would be really great if you didn't let people divide the world
p239
aVinto the creatives and the non-creatives, like it's some God-given thing,
p240
aVand to have people realize that they're naturally creative,
p241
aVand that those natural people should let their ideas fly;
p242
aVthat they should achieve what Bandura calls self-efficacy,
p243
aVthat you can do what you set out to do,
p244
aVand that you can reach a place of creative confidence
p245
aVand touch the snake.
p246
aa(lp247
VThank you.
