VI'll never forget that day
p4
aVback in the spring of 2006.
p5
aVI was a surgical resident
p6
aVat The Johns Hopkins Hospital,
p7
aVtaking emergency call.
p8
aVI got paged by the E.R. around 2 in the morning
p9
aVto come and see a woman with a diabetic ulcer
p10
aVon her foot.
p11
aVI can still remember sort of that smell of rotting flesh
p12
aVas I pulled the curtain back to see her.
p13
aVAnd everybody there agreed this woman was very sick
p14
aVand she needed to be in the hospital.
p15
aVThat wasn't being asked.
p16
aVThe question that was being asked of me was a different one,
p17
aVwhich was, did she also need an amputation?
p18
aa(lp19
VNow, looking back on that night,
p20
aVI'd love so desperately to believe that I treated that woman
p21
aVon that night with the same empathy and compassion
p22
aVI'd shown the 27-year-old newlywed
p23
aVwho came to the E.R. three nights earlier
p24
aVwith lower back pain
p25
aVthat turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer.
p26
aVIn her case, I knew there was nothing I could do
p27
aVthat was actually going to save her life.
p28
aVThe cancer was too advanced.
p29
aVBut I was committed to making sure that
p30
aVI could do anything possible to make her stay
p31
aVmore comfortable. I brought her a warm blanket
p32
aVand a cup of a coffee.
p33
aVI brought some for her parents.
p34
aVBut more importantly, see, I passed no judgment on her,
p35
aVbecause obviously she had done nothing
p36
aVto bring this on herself.
p37
aVSo why was it that, just a few nights later,
p38
aVas I stood in that same E.R. and determined
p39
aVthat my diabetic patient did indeed need an amputation,
p40
aVwhy did I hold her in such bitter contempt?
p41
aa(lp42
VYou see, unlike the woman the night before,
p43
aVthis woman had type 2 diabetes.
p44
aVShe was fat.
p45
aVAnd we all know that's from eating too much
p46
aVand not exercising enough, right?
p47
aVI mean, how hard can it be?
p48
aVAs I looked down at her in the bed, I thought to myself,
p49
aVif you just tried caring even a little bit,
p50
aVyou wouldn't be in this situation at this moment
p51
aVwith some doctor you've never met
p52
aVabout to amputate your foot.
p53
aa(lp54
VWhy did I feel justified in judging her?
p55
aVI'd like to say I don't know.
p56
aVBut I actually do.
p57
aVYou see, in the hubris of my youth,
p58
aVI thought I had her all figured out.
p59
aVShe ate too much. She got unlucky.
p60
aVShe got diabetes. Case closed.
p61
aa(lp62
VIronically, at that time in my life,
p63
aVI was also doing cancer research,
p64
aVimmune-based therapies for melanoma, to be specific,
p65
aVand in that world I was actually taught to question everything,
p66
aVto challenge all assumptions
p67
aVand hold them to the highest possible scientific standards.
p68
aVYet when it came to a disease like diabetes
p69
aVthat kills Americans eight times more frequently than melanoma,
p70
aVI never once questioned the conventional wisdom.
p71
aVI actually just assumed the pathologic sequence of events
p72
aVwas settled science.
p73
aa(lp74
VThree years later, I found out how wrong I was.
p75
aVBut this time, I was the patient.
p76
aVDespite exercising three or four hours every single day,
p77
aVand following the food pyramid to the letter,
p78
aVI'd gained a lot of weight and developed something
p79
aVcalled metabolic syndrome.
p80
aVSome of you may have heard of this.
p81
aVI had become insulin-resistant.
p82
aa(lp83
VYou can think of insulin as this master hormone
p84
aVthat controls what our body does with the foods we eat,
p85
aVwhether we burn it or store it.
p86
aVThis is called fuel partitioning in the lingo.
p87
aVNow failure to produce enough insulin is incompatible with life.
p88
aVAnd insulin resistance, as its name suggests,
p89
aVis when your cells get increasingly resistant
p90
aVto the effect of insulin trying to do its job.
p91
aVOnce you're insulin-resistant,
p92
aVyou're on your way to getting diabetes,
p93
aVwhich is what happens when your pancreas
p94
aVcan't keep up with the resistance and make enough insulin.
p95
aVNow your blood sugar levels start to rise,
p96
aVand an entire cascade of pathologic events
p97
aVsort of spirals out of control that can lead to heart disease,
p98
aVcancer, even Alzheimer's disease,
p99
aVand amputations, just like that woman a few years earlier.
p100
aa(lp101
VWith that scare, I got busy changing my diet radically,
p102
aVadding and subtracting things most of you would find
p103
aValmost assuredly shocking.
p104
aVI did this and lost 40 pounds, weirdly while exercising less.
p105
aVI, as you can see, I guess I'm not overweight anymore.
p106
aVMore importantly, I don't have insulin resistance.
p107
aa(lp108
VBut most important, I was left
p109
aVwith these three burning questions that wouldn't go away:
p110
aVHow did this happen to me if I was supposedly
p111
aVdoing everything right?
p112
aVIf the conventional wisdom about nutrition had failed me,
p113
aVwas it possible it was failing someone else?
p114
aVAnd underlying these questions,
p115
aVI became almost maniacally obsessed
p116
aVin trying to understand the real relationship
p117
aVbetween obesity and insulin resistance.
p118
aa(lp119
VNow, most researchers believe obesity
p120
aVis the cause of insulin resistance.
p121
aVLogically, then, if you want to treat insulin resistance,
p122
aVyou get people to lose weight, right?
p123
aVYou treat the obesity.
p124
aVBut what if we have it backwards?
p125
aVWhat if obesity isn't the cause of insulin resistance at all?
p126
aVIn fact, what if it's a symptom of a much deeper problem,
p127
aVthe tip of a proverbial iceberg?
p128
aVI know it sounds crazy because we're obviously in the midst
p129
aVof an obesity epidemic, but hear me out.
p130
aVWhat if obesity is a coping mechanism
p131
aVfor a far more sinister problem going on
p132
aVunderneath the cell?
p133
aVI'm not suggesting that obesity is benign,
p134
aVbut what I am suggesting is it may be the lesser
p135
aVof two metabolic evils.
p136
aa(lp137
VYou can think of insulin resistance as the reduced capacity
p138
aVof our cells to partition fuel,
p139
aVas I alluded to a moment ago,
p140
aVtaking those calories that we take in
p141
aVand burning some appropriately and storing some appropriately.
p142
aVWhen we become insulin-resistant,
p143
aVthe homeostasis in that balance deviates from this state.
p144
aVSo now, when insulin says to a cell,
p145
aVI want you to burn more energy
p146
aVthan the cell considers safe, the cell, in effect, says,
p147
aV"No thanks, I'd actually rather store this energy."
p148
aVAnd because fat cells are actually missing most of
p149
aVthe complex cellular machinery found in other cells,
p150
aVit's probably the safest place to store it.
p151
aVSo for many of us, about 75 million Americans,
p152
aVthe appropriate response to insulin resistance
p153
aVmay actually be to store it as fat, not the reverse,
p154
aVgetting insulin resistance in response to getting fat.
p155
aa(lp156
VThis is a really subtle distinction,
p157
aVbut the implication could be profound.
p158
aVConsider the following analogy:
p159
aVThink of the bruise you get on your shin
p160
aVwhen you inadvertently bang your leg into the coffee table.
p161
aVSure, the bruise hurts like hell, and you almost certainly
p162
aVdon't like the discolored look, but we all know
p163
aVthe bruise per Se is not the problem.
p164
aVIn fact, it's the opposite. It's a healthy response to the trauma,
p165
aVall of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury
p166
aVto salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread
p167
aVof infection to elsewhere in the body.
p168
aVNow, imagine we thought bruises were the problem,
p169
aVand we evolved a giant medical establishment
p170
aVand a culture around treating bruises:
p171
aVmasking creams, painkillers, you name it,
p172
aVall the while ignoring the fact that people
p173
aVare still banging their shins into coffee tables.
p174
aVHow much better would we be if we treated the cause \u2014
p175
aVtelling people to pay attention
p176
aVwhen they walk through the living room \u2014
p177
aVrather than the effect?
p178
aVGetting the cause and the effect right
p179
aVmakes all the difference in the world.
p180
aVGetting it wrong, and the pharmaceutical industry
p181
aVcan still do very well for its shareholders
p182
aVbut nothing improves for the people with bruised shins.
p183
aVCause and effect.
p184
aa(lp185
VSo what I'm suggesting is
p186
aVmaybe we have the cause and effect wrong
p187
aVon obesity and insulin resistance.
p188
aVMaybe we should be asking ourselves,
p189
aVis it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain
p190
aVand the diseases associated with obesity,
p191
aVat least in most people?
p192
aVWhat if being obese is just a metabolic response
p193
aVto something much more threatening,
p194
aVan underlying epidemic,
p195
aVthe one we ought to be worried about?
p196
aa(lp197
VLet's look at some suggestive facts.
p198
aVWe know that 30 million obese Americans
p199
aVin the United States don't have insulin resistance.
p200
aVAnd by the way, they don't appear to be at any
p201
aVgreater risk of disease than lean people.
p202
aVConversely, we know that six million lean people
p203
aVin the United States are insulin-resistant,
p204
aVand by the way, they appear to be at even greater risk
p205
aVfor those metabolic diseases I mentioned a moment ago
p206
aVthan their obese counterparts.
p207
aVNow I don't know why, but it might be because,
p208
aVin their case, their cells haven't actually figured out
p209
aVthe right thing to do with that excess energy.
p210
aVSo if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance,
p211
aVand you can be lean and have it,
p212
aVthis suggests that obesity may just be a proxy
p213
aVfor what's going on.
p214
aa(lp215
VSo what if we're fighting the wrong war,
p216
aVfighting obesity rather than insulin resistance?
p217
aVEven worse, what if blaming the obese
p218
aVmeans we're blaming the victims?
p219
aVWhat if some of our fundamental ideas about obesity
p220
aVare just wrong?
p221
aa(lp222
VPersonally, I can't afford the luxury of arrogance anymore,
p223
aVlet alone the luxury of certainty.
p224
aVI have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this,
p225
aVbut I'm wide open to others.
p226
aVNow, my hypothesis, because everybody always asks me,
p227
aVis this.
p228
aVIf you ask yourself, what's a cell trying to protect itself from
p229
aVwhen it becomes insulin resistant,
p230
aVthe answer probably isn't too much food.
p231
aVIt's more likely too much glucose: blood sugar.
p232
aVNow, we know that refined grains and starches
p233
aVelevate your blood sugar in the short run,
p234
aVand there's even reason to believe that sugar
p235
aVmay lead to insulin resistance directly.
p236
aVSo if you put these physiological processes to work,
p237
aVI'd hypothesize that it might be our increased intake
p238
aVof refined grains, sugars and starches that's driving
p239
aVthis epidemic of obesity and diabetes,
p240
aVbut through insulin resistance,
p241
aVyou see, and not necessarily through just overeating and under-exercising.
p242
aa(lp243
VWhen I lost my 40 pounds a few years ago,
p244
aVI did it simply by restricting those things,
p245
aVwhich admittedly suggests I have a bias
p246
aVbased on my personal experience.
p247
aVBut that doesn't mean my bias is wrong,
p248
aVand most important, all of this can be tested scientifically.
p249
aVBut step one is accepting the possibility
p250
aVthat our current beliefs about obesity,
p251
aVdiabetes and insulin resistance could be wrong
p252
aVand therefore must be tested.
p253
aVI'm betting my career on this.
p254
aVToday, I devote all of my time to working on this problem,
p255
aVand I'll go wherever the science takes me.
p256
aVI've decided that what I can't and won't do anymore
p257
aVis pretend I have the answers when I don't.
p258
aVI've been humbled enough by all I don't know.
p259
aa(lp260
VFor the past year, I've been fortunate enough
p261
aVto work on this problem with the most amazing team
p262
aVof diabetes and obesity researchers in the country,
p263
aVand the best part is,
p264
aVjust like Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals,
p265
aVwe've done the same thing.
p266
aVWe've recruited a team of scientific rivals,
p267
aVthe best and brightest who all have different hypotheses
p268
aVfor what's at the heart of this epidemic.
p269
aVSome think it's too many calories consumed.
p270
aVOthers think it's too much dietary fat.
p271
aVOthers think it's too many refined grains and starches.
p272
aVBut this team of multi-disciplinary,
p273
aVhighly skeptical and exceedingly talented researchers
p274
aVdo agree on two things.
p275
aVFirst, this problem is just simply too important
p276
aVto continue ignoring because we think we know the answer.
p277
aVAnd two, if we're willing to be wrong,
p278
aVif we're willing to challenge the conventional wisdom
p279
aVwith the best experiments science can offer,
p280
aVwe can solve this problem.
p281
aa(lp282
VI know it's tempting to want an answer right now,
p283
aVsome form of action or policy, some dietary prescription \u2014
p284
aVeat this, not that \u2014
p285
aVbut if we want to get it right,
p286
aVwe're going to have to do much more rigorous science
p287
aVbefore we can write that prescription.
p288
aa(lp289
VBriefly, to address this, our research program
p290
aVis focused around three meta-themes, or questions.
p291
aVFirst, how do the various foods we consume
p292
aVimpact our metabolism, hormones and enzymes,
p293
aVand through what nuanced molecular mechanisms?
p294
aVSecond, based on these insights,
p295
aVcan people make the necessary changes in their diets
p296
aVin a way that's safe and practical to implement?
p297
aVAnd finally, once we identify what safe
p298
aVand practical changes people can make to their diet,
p299
aVhow can we move their behavior in that direction
p300
aVso that it becomes more the default
p301
aVrather than the exception?
p302
aVJust because you know what to do doesn't mean
p303
aVyou're always going to do it.
p304
aVSometimes we have to put cues around people
p305
aVto make it easier, and believe it or not,
p306
aVthat can be studied scientifically.
p307
aa(lp308
VI don't know how this journey is going to end,
p309
aVbut this much seems clear to me, at least:
p310
aVWe can't keep blaming our overweight and diabetic patients
p311
aVlike I did.
p312
aVMost of them actually want to do the right thing,
p313
aVbut they have to know what that is,
p314
aVand it's got to work.
p315
aVI dream of a day when our patients can
p316
aVshed their excess pounds
p317
aVand cure themselves of insulin resistance,
p318
aVbecause as medical professionals,
p319
aVwe've shed our excess mental baggage
p320
aVand cured ourselves of new idea resistance sufficiently
p321
aVto go back to our original ideals:
p322
aVopen minds, the courage to throw out yesterday's ideas
p323
aVwhen they don't appear to be working,
p324
aVand the understanding that scientific truth isn't final,
p325
aVbut constantly evolving.
p326
aVStaying true to that path will be better for our patients
p327
aVand better for science.
p328
aVIf obesity is nothing more than a proxy
p329
aVfor metabolic illness,
p330
aVwhat good does it do us to punish those with the proxy?
p331
aa(lp332
VSometimes I think back to that night in the E.R.
p333
aVseven years ago.
p334
aVI wish I could speak with that woman again.
p335
aVI'd like to tell her how sorry I am.
p336
aVI'd say, as a doctor, I delivered
p337
aVthe best clinical care I could,
p338
aVbut as a human being,
p339
aVI let you down.
p340
aVYou didn't need my judgment and my contempt.
p341
aVYou needed my empathy and compassion,
p342
aVand above all else, you needed a doctor
p343
aVwho was willing to consider
p344
aVmaybe you didn't let the system down.
p345
aVMaybe the system, of which I was a part,
p346
aVwas letting you down.
p347
aVIf you're watching this now,
p348
aVI hope you can forgive me.
