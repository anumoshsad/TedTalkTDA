VI'd like for you to take a moment to imagine this with me.
p4
aVYou're a little girl of five years old.
p5
aVSitting in front of a mirror,
p6
aVyou ask yourself,
p7
aV"Do I exist?"
p8
aVIn this space, there is very little context,
p9
aVand so you move into a different one,
p10
aVone filled with people.
p11
aVSurely, now you know you're not a figment of your own imagination.
p12
aVYou breathe their air.
p13
aVYou see them,
p14
aVso they must see you.
p15
aVAnd yet, you still can't help but wonder:
p16
aVDo I only exist when people speak to me?
p17
aa(lp18
VPretty heavy thoughts for a child, right?
p19
aVBut through various artworks that reflect upon our society,
p20
aVI came to understand how a young black girl can grow up
p21
aVfeeling as if she's not seen, and perhaps she doesn't exist.
p22
aVYou see, if young people don't have positive images of themselves
p23
aVand all that remains are negative stereotypes,
p24
aVthis affects their self-image.
p25
aVBut it also affects the way that the rest of society treats them.
p26
aa(lp27
VI discovered this
p28
aVhaving lived in Cape Town for about five years at the time.
p29
aVI felt a deep sense of dislocation and invisibility.
p30
aVI couldn't see myself represented.
p31
aVI couldn't see the women who've raised me,
p32
aVthe ones who've influenced me,
p33
aVand the ones that have made South Africa what it is today.
p34
aVI decided to do something about it.
p35
aa(lp36
VWhat do you think when you see this?
p37
aVIf you were a black girl,
p38
aVhow would it make you feel?
p39
aVWalking down the street,
p40
aVwhat does the city you live in say to you?
p41
aVWhat symbols are present?
p42
aVWhich histories are celebrated?
p43
aVAnd on the other hand,
p44
aVwhich ones are omitted?
p45
aa(lp46
VYou see, public spaces are hardly ever as neutral as they may seem.
p47
aVI discovered this when I made this performance in 2013 on Heritage Day.
p48
aVCape Town is teeming with masculine architecture,
p49
aVmonuments and statues,
p50
aVsuch as Louis Botha in that photograph.
p51
aVThis overt presence of white colonial and Afrikaner nationalist men
p52
aVnot only echoes a social, gender and racial divide,
p53
aVbut it also continues to affect the way that women \u2014
p54
aVand the way, particularly, black women \u2014
p55
aVsee themselves in relation to dominant male figures
p56
aVin public spaces.
p57
aVFor this reason, among others,
p58
aVI don't believe that we need statues.
p59
aVThe preservation of history and the act of remembering
p60
aVcan be achieved in more memorable and effective ways.
p61
aa(lp62
VAs part of a year-long public holiday series,
p63
aVI use performance art as a form of social commentary
p64
aVto draw people's attention to certain issues,
p65
aVas well as addressing the absence of the black female body
p66
aVin memorialized public spaces,
p67
aVespecially on public holidays.
p68
aVWomen's Day was coming up.
p69
aVI looked at what the day means \u2014
p70
aVthe Women's March to the union buildings in 1956,
p71
aVpetitioning against the pass laws.
p72
aVJuxtaposed with the hypocrisy of how women are treated,
p73
aVespecially in public spaces today,
p74
aVI decided to do something about it.
p75
aa(lp76
VHeadline:
p77
aa(lp78
V[Women in miniskirt attacked at taxi rank]
p79
aa(lp80
VHow do I comment on such polar opposites?
p81
aVIn the guise of my great-grandmother,
p82
aVI performed bare-breasted,
p83
aVclose to the taxi rank in KwaLanga.
p84
aVThis space is also called Freedom Square,
p85
aVwhere women were a part of demonstrations against apartheid laws.
p86
aVI was not comfortable with women being seen as only victims in society.
p87
aVYou might wonder how people reacted to this.
p88
aa(lp89
V(Video) Woman: (Cheering)
p90
aa(lp91
VWoman 2 (offscreen): Yes!
p92
aa(lp93
VSethembile Msezane: Pretty cool, huh?
p94
aa(lp95
V(Applause)
p96
aa(lp97
VSo I realized that through my performances,
p98
aVI've been able to make regular people reflect upon their society,
p99
aVlooking at the past as well as the current democracy.
p100
aa(lp101
V(Video) Man (offscreen): She's been there since three o'clock.
p102
aa(lp103
VMan 2 (offscreen): Just before three. About an hour still?
p104
aa(lp105
VMan 1: Yeah. It's just a really hot day.
p106
aa(lp107
VMan 1: It's very interesting.
p108
aVIt's very powerful.
p109
aVI think it's cool.
p110
aVI think a lot of people are quick to join a group
p111
aVthat's a movement towards something,
p112
aVbut not many people are ready to do something as an individual.
p113
aa(lp114
VMan 2: So it's the individual versus the collective.
p115
aa(lp116
VMan 1: Yeah.
p117
aVSo I think her pushing her own individual message in performance ...
p118
aVit's powerful.
p119
aVYeah, I think it's quite powerful that she's doing it on her own.
p120
aVI'd be interested to know why she's using hair extensions as wings,
p121
aVor whatever those things are meant to be.
p122
aVThey are wings, yes?
p123
aa(lp124
VWoman 3: With her standing there right now,
p125
aVI think it's just my interpretation
p126
aVthat we are bringing the statue down
p127
aVand bringing up something
p128
aVthat's supposed to represent African pride, I think.
p129
aVOr something like that.
p130
aVSomething should stand while Rhodes falls,
p131
aVI think that's what it's saying. Yeah.
p132
aVYes. Thank you.
p133
aa(lp134
VMan 3: What is behind me represents the African culture.
p135
aVWe can't have the colonialist law,
p136
aVso we need to remove all these colonial statues.
p137
aVWe have have our own statues now,
p138
aVour African leaders \u2014 Bhambatha, Moshoeshoe, Kwame Nkrumah \u2014
p139
aVall those who paid their lives for our liberation.
p140
aVWe can't continue in the 21st century,
p141
aVand after 21 years of democracy,
p142
aVhave the colonizers in our own country.
p143
aVThey belong somewhere. Maybe in a museum; not here.
p144
aVI mean learning institutions, places where young people,
p145
aVyoung minds are being shaped.
p146
aVSo we cannot continue to have Louis Botha, Rhodes, all these people,
p147
aVbecause they're representing the colonialism.
p148
aa(lp149
V(Applause)
p150
aa(lp151
VSethembile Msezane: On April 9, 2015,
p152
aVthe Cecil John Rhodes statue was scheduled to be removed
p153
aVafter a month of debates for and against its removal
p154
aVby various stakeholders.
p155
aVThis caused a widespread interest in statues in South Africa.
p156
aVOpinions varied, but the media focused on problematizing
p157
aVthe removal of statues.
p158
aVOn that \u2014 well, that year, I had just begun my master's
p159
aVat the University of Cape Town.
p160
aVDuring the time of the debate of the statue,
p161
aVI had been having reoccurring dreams
p162
aVabout a bird.
p163
aVAnd so I started conjuring her
p164
aVmentally, spiritually and through dress.
p165
aVOn that day,
p166
aVI happened to be having a meeting with my supervisors,
p167
aVand they told me that the statue was going to fall on that day.
p168
aVI told them that I'd explain later,
p169
aVbut we had to postpone the meeting
p170
aVbecause I was going to perform her as the statue came down.
p171
aa(lp172
VHer name was Chapungu.
p173
aVShe was a soapstone bird that was looted from Great Zimbabwe
p174
aVin the late 1800s,
p175
aVand is still currently housed in Cecil John Rhodes's estate
p176
aVin Cape Town.
p177
aVOn that day,
p178
aVI embodied her existence using my body,
p179
aVwhile standing in the blazing sun for nearly four hours.
p180
aVAs the time came,
p181
aVthe crane came alive.
p182
aVThe people did, too \u2014
p183
aVshouting,
p184
aVscreaming,
p185
aVclenching their fists
p186
aVand taking pictures of the moment on their phones and cameras.
p187
aVChapungu's wings,
p188
aValong with the crane,
p189
aVrose to declare the fall of Cecil John Rhodes.
p190
aa(lp191
V(Applause)
p192
aa(lp193
VEuphoria filled the air as he became absent from his base,
p194
aVwhile she remained still,
p195
aVvery present,
p196
aVhalf an hour after his removal.
p197
aa(lp198
VTwenty-three years after apartheid,
p199
aVa new generation of radicals has arisen in South Africa.
p200
aVThe story of Chapungu and Rhodes in the same space and time
p201
aVasks important questions
p202
aVrelated to gender,
p203
aVpower,
p204
aVself-representation,
p205
aVhistory making
p206
aVand repatriation.
p207
aVFrom then on,
p208
aVI realized that my spiritual beliefs and dreams
p209
aVtexture my material reality.
p210
aVBut for me, Chapungu's story felt incomplete.
p211
aVThis soapstone bird,
p212
aVa spiritual medium and messenger of God and the ancestors,
p213
aVneeded me to continue her story.
p214
aVAnd so I dabbled in the dream space a little bit more,
p215
aVand this is how "Falling" was born.

VIn the film,
p226
aVZimbabwe, South Africa and Germany share a common story
p227
aVabout the soapstone birds that were looted from Great Zimbabwe.
p228
aVAfter Zimbabwe gained its independence,
p229
aVall the birds except for one were returned to the monument.
p230
aV"Falling" explores the mythological belief that there will be unrest
p231
aVuntil the final bird is returned.
p232
aa(lp233
VThrough my work,
p234
aVI have realized a lot about the world around me:
p235
aVhow we move through spaces,
p236
aVwho we choose to celebrate
p237
aVand who we remember.
p238
aVNow I look in the mirror and not only see an image of myself,
p239
aVbut of the women who have made me who I am today.
p240
aVI stand tall in my work,
p241
aVcelebrating women's histories,
p242
aVin the hope that perhaps one day,
p243
aVno little black girl has to ever feel
p244
aVlike she doesn't exist.
