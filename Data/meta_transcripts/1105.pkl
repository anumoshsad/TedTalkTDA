VClaron McFadden: The human voice:
p22
aVmysterious, spontaneous, primal.
p23
aVFor me, the human voice is the vessel on which all emotions travel \u2014
p24
aVexcept, perhaps, jealousy.
p25
aVAnd the breath,
p26
aVthe breath is the captain of that vessel.
p27
aVA child is born,
p28
aVtakes its first breath \u2014
p29

VWhah!
p33
aVAnd we behold the wondrous beauty
p34
aVof vocal expression \u2014
p35
aVmysterious, spontaneous
p36
aVand primal.
p37
aa(lp38
VA few years ago, I did a meditation retreat in Thailand.
p39
aVI wanted a place
p40
aVwhere I would have total silence and total solitude.
p41
aVI spent two weeks at this retreat
p42
aVin my own little hut \u2014
p43
aVno music, no nothing \u2014 sounds of nature,
p44
aVtrying to find the essence of concentration,
p45
aVbeing in the moment.
p46
aa(lp47
VOn my last day,
p48
aVthe woman who looked after the place,
p49
aVshe came and we spoke for a minute,
p50
aVand then she said to me,
p51
aV"Would you sing something for me?"
p52
aVAnd I thought, but this is a place of total quiet and silence.
p53
aVI can't make noise.
p54
aVShe said, "Please, sing for me."
p55
aVSo I closed my eyes,
p56
aVI took breath
p57
aVand the first thing that came up and out
p58
aVwas "Summertime,"
p59
aVPorgy and Bess.
p60
aa(lp61
V(Singing) Summertime and the livin' is easy.
p62
aVFish are jumpin' and the cotton is high.
p63
aVOh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'.
p64
aVSo hush little baby,
p65
aVdon't you cry.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd I opened my eyes,
p68
aVand I saw that she had her eyes closed.
p69
aVAnd after a moment, she opened her eyes
p70
aVand she looked at me and she said,
p71
aV"It's like meditation."
p72
aa(lp73
VAnd in that moment I understood
p74
aVthat everything I had gone to Thailand to look for,
p75
aVto search for,
p76
aVI had it already in my singing \u2014
p77
aVthe calm, but alertness,
p78
aVthe focus, but awareness,
p79
aVand being totally in the moment.
p80
aVWhen you're totally in the moment \u2014
p81
aVwhen I'm totally in the moment,
p82
aVthe vessel of expression is open.
p83
aVThe emotions can flow from me
p84
aVto you
p85
aVand back.
p86
aVIt's an extremely profound experience.
p87
aa(lp88
VThere's a piece by a composer,
p89
aVan American composer called John Cage.
p90
aVIt's called "Aria."
p91
aVIt was written for an amazing singer called Cathy Berberian.
p92
aVAnd the thing about this piece that's so special \u2014
p93
aVif you see it behind me \u2014
p94
aVit's not notated in any way.
p95
aVNo notes, no flats, no sharps.
p96
aVBut it's a kind of structure.
p97
aVAnd the singer, within this structure,
p98
aVhas total freedom to be creative, spontaneous.
p99
aa(lp100
VFor example,
p101
aVthere are different colors
p102
aVand each color gets a different type of singing \u2014
p103
aVpop, country and western, opera, jazz \u2014
p104
aVand you just have to be consistent with that color.
p105
aVYou see there are different lines.
p106
aVYou choose in your own tempo in your own way
p107
aVto follow the line,
p108
aVbut you must respect it,
p109
aVmore or less.
p110
aVAnd these little dots,
p111
aVthese represent a sort of sound
p112
aVthat's not a vocal, not a lyrical way
p113
aVof expressing the voice.
p114
aVUsing the body \u2014 it could be sneezing,
p115
aVit could be coughing, animals \u2014
p116
aa(lp117
V(Audience member coughs)
p118
aa(lp119
VExactly. (Laughter)
p120
aa(lp121
VClapping, whatever.
p122
aVAnd there's different text.
p123
aVThere's Armenian, Russian, French, English, Italian.
p124
aVSo within this structure, one is free.
p125
aVTo me, this piece is an ode to the voice,
p126
aVbecause it's mysterious, as we can see.
p127
aVIt's quite spontaneous.
p128
aVAnd it's primal.
p129
aVSo I would like to share this piece with you,
p130
aVIt's "Aria," of John Cage.
