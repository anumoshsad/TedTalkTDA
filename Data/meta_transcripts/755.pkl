VSo, imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in America
p4
aVand a Japanese man comes up to you and says,
p5
aa(lp6
V"Excuse me, what is the name of this block?"
p7
aa(lp8
VAnd you say, "I'm sorry, well, this is Oak Street, that's Elm Street.
p9
aVThis is 26th, that's 27th."
p10
aa(lp11
VHe says, "OK, but what is the name of that block?"
p12
aa(lp13
VYou say, "Well, blocks don't have names.
p14
aVStreets have names; blocks are just the
p15
aVunnamed spaces in between streets."
p16
aa(lp17
VHe leaves, a little confused and disappointed.
p18
aa(lp19
VSo, now imagine you're standing on a street, anywhere in Japan,
p20
aVyou turn to a person next to you and say,
p21
aa(lp22
V"Excuse me, what is the name of this street?"
p23
aa(lp24
VThey say, "Oh, well that's Block 17 and this is Block 16."
p25
aa(lp26
VAnd you say, "OK, but what is the name of this street?"
p27
aa(lp28
VAnd they say, "Well, streets don't have names.
p29
aVBlocks have names.
p30
aVJust look at Google Maps here. There's Block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
p31
aVAll of these blocks have names,
p32
aVand the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks.
p33
aa(lp34
VAnd you say then, "OK, then how do you know your home address?"
p35
aa(lp36
VHe said, "Well, easy, this is District Eight.
p37
aVThere's Block 17, house number one."
p38
aa(lp39
VYou say, "OK, but walking around the neighborhood,
p40
aVI noticed that the house numbers don't go in order."
p41
aa(lp42
VHe says, "Of course they do. They go in the order in which they were built.
p43
aVThe first house ever built on a block is house number one.
p44
aVThe second house ever built is house number two.
p45
aVThird is house number three. It's easy. It's obvious."
p46
aa(lp47
VSo, I love that sometimes we need to
p48
aVgo to the opposite side of the world
p49
aVto realize assumptions we didn't even know we had,
p50
aVand realize that the opposite of them may also be true.
p51
aa(lp52
VSo, for example, there are doctors in China
p53
aVwho believe that it's their job to keep you healthy.
p54
aVSo, any month you are healthy you pay them,
p55
aVand when you're sick you don't have to pay them because they failed
p56
aVat their job. They get rich when you're healthy, not sick.
p57
aV(Applause)

aa(lp59
VIn most music, we think of the "one"
p60
aVas the downbeat, the beginning of the musical phrase: one, two, three, four.
p61
aVBut in West African music, the "one"
p62
aVis thought of as the end of the phrase,
p63
aVlike the period at the end of a sentence.
p64
aVSo, you can hear it not just in the phrasing, but the way they count off their music:
p65
aVtwo, three, four, one.
p66
aa(lp67
VAnd this map is also accurate.
p68
aV(Laughter)
p69
aa(lp70
VThere's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India,
p71
aVthe opposite is also true.
p72
aVSo, let's never forget, whether at TED, or anywhere else,
p73
aVthat whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear,
p74
aVthat the opposite may also be true.
p75
aVDomo arigato gozaimashita.
