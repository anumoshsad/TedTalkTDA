VHi. I'm here to talk about congestion,
p4
aVnamely road congestion.
p5
aVRoad congestion is a pervasive phenomenon.
p6
aVIt exists in basically all of the cities all around the world,
p7
aVwhich is a little bit surprising when you think about it.
p8
aVI mean, think about how different cities are, actually.
p9
aVI mean, you have the typical European cities,
p10
aVwith a dense urban core, good public transportation
p11
aVmostly, not a lot of road capacity.
p12
aVBut then, on the other hand, you have the American cities.
p13
aVIt's moving by itself, okay.
p14
aVAnyway, the American cities:
p15
aVlots of roads dispersed over large areas,
p16
aValmost no public transportation.
p17
aVAnd then you have the emerging world cities,
p18
aVwith a mixed variety of vehicles,
p19
aVmixed land-use patterns, also rather dispersed
p20
aVbut often with a very dense urban core.
p21
aVAnd traffic planners all around the world have tried
p22
aVlots of different measures: dense cities or dispersed cities,
p23
aVlots of roads or lots of public transport
p24
aVor lots of bike lanes or more information,
p25
aVor lots of different things, but nothing seems to work.
p26
aa(lp27
VBut all of these attempts have one thing in common.
p28
aVThey're basically attempts at figuring out
p29
aVwhat people should do instead of rush hour car driving.
p30
aVThey're essentially, to a point, attempts at planning
p31
aVwhat other people should do, planning their life for them.
p32
aa(lp33
VNow, planning a complex social system
p34
aVis a very hard thing to do, and let me tell you a story.
p35
aVBack in 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell,
p36
aVan urban planner in London got a phone call
p37
aVfrom a colleague in Moscow saying, basically,
p38
aV"Hi, this is Vladimir. I'd like to know,
p39
aVwho's in charge of London's bread supply?"
p40
aa(lp41
VAnd the urban planner in London goes,
p42
aV"What do you mean, who's in charge of London's \u2014
p43
aVI mean, no one is in charge."
p44
aV"Oh, but surely someone must be in charge.
p45
aVI mean, it's a very complicated system. Someone must control all of this."
p46
aa(lp47
V"No. No. No one is in charge.
p48
aVI mean, it basically \u2014 I haven't really thought of it.
p49
aVIt basically organizes itself."
p50
aa(lp51
VIt organizes itself.
p52
aVThat's an example of a complex social system
p53
aVwhich has the ability of self-organizing,
p54
aVand this is a very deep insight.
p55
aVWhen you try to solve really complex social problems,
p56
aVthe right thing to do is most of the time
p57
aVto create the incentives.
p58
aVYou don't plan the details,
p59
aVand people will figure out what to do,
p60
aVhow to adapt to this new framework.
p61
aa(lp62
VAnd let's now look at how we can use this insight
p63
aVto combat road congestion.
p64
aa(lp65
VThis is a map of Stockholm, my hometown.
p66
aVNow, Stockholm is a medium-sized city, roughly two million people,
p67
aVbut Stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water
p68
aVmeans lots of bridges \u2014 narrow bridges, old bridges \u2014
p69
aVwhich means lots of road congestion.
p70
aVAnd these red dots show the most congested parts,
p71
aVwhich are the bridges that lead into the inner city.
p72
aVAnd then someone came up with the idea that,
p73
aVapart from good public transport,
p74
aVapart from spending money on roads,
p75
aVlet's try to charge drivers one or two euros at these bottlenecks.
p76
aa(lp77
VNow, one or two euros, that isn't really a lot of money,
p78
aVI mean compared to parking charges and running costs, etc.,
p79
aVso you would probably expect that car drivers
p80
aVwouldn't really react to this fairly small charge.
p81
aVYou would be wrong.
p82
aVOne or two euros was enough to make 20 percent of cars
p83
aVdisappear from rush hours.
p84
aVNow, 20 percent, well, that's a fairly huge figure, you might think,
p85
aVbut you've still got 80 percent left of the problem, right?
p86
aVBecause you still have 80 percent of the traffic.
p87
aVNow, that's also wrong, because traffic happens to be
p88
aVa nonlinear phenomenon, meaning that
p89
aVonce you reach above a certain capacity threshold
p90
aVthen congestion starts to increase really, really rapidly.
p91
aVBut fortunately, it also works the other way around.
p92
aVIf you can reduce traffic even somewhat, then congestion
p93
aVwill go down much faster than you might think.
p94
aVNow, congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm
p95
aVon January 3, 2006, and the first picture here is a picture
p96
aVof Stockholm, one of the typical streets, January 2.
p97
aVThe first day with the congestion charges looked like this.
p98
aVThis is what happens when you take away
p99
aV20 percent of the cars from the streets.
p100
aVYou really reduce congestion quite substantially.
p101
aa(lp102
VBut, well, as I said, I mean, car drivers adapt, right?
p103
aVSo after a while they would all come back because they
p104
aVhave sort of gotten used to charges.
p105
aVWrong again. It's now six and a half years ago
p106
aVsince the congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm,
p107
aVand we basically have the same low traffic levels still.
p108
aa(lp109
VBut you see, there's an interesting gap here in the time series
p110
aVin 2007.
p111
aVWell, the thing is that, the congestion charges,
p112
aVthey were introduced first as a trial, so they were introduced
p113
aVin January and then abolished again at the end of July,
p114
aVfollowed by a referendum, and then they were reintroduced
p115
aVagain in 2007, which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity.
p116
aVI mean, this was a really fun experiment to start with,
p117
aVand we actually got to do it twice.
p118
aVAnd personally, I would like to do this every once a year or so,
p119
aVbut they won't let me do that.
p120
aVBut it was fun anyway.
p121
aa(lp122
VSo, we followed up. What happened?
p123
aVThis is the last day with the congestion charges, July 31,
p124
aVand you see the same street but now it's summer,
p125
aVand summer in Stockholm is a very nice
p126
aVand light time of the year,
p127
aVand the first day without the congestion charges
p128
aVlooked like this.
p129
aVAll the cars were back again, and you even have to admire
p130
aVthe car drivers. They adapt so extremely quickly.
p131
aVThe first day they all came back.
p132
aVAnd this effect hanged on. So 2007 figures looked like this.
p133
aa(lp134
VNow these traffic figures are really exciting
p135
aVand a little bit surprising and very useful to know,
p136
aVbut I would say that the most surprising slide here
p137
aVI'm going to show you today is not this one. It's this one.
p138
aVThis shows public support for congestion pricing of Stockholm,
p139
aVand you see that when congestion pricing were introduced
p140
aVin the beginning of Spring 2006, people were fiercely against it.
p141
aVSeventy percent of the population didn't want this.
p142
aVBut what happened when the congestion charges
p143
aVwere there is not what you would expect, that people hated it more and more.
p144
aVNo, on the contrary, they changed, up to a point
p145
aVwhere we now have 70 percent support for keeping the charges,
p146
aVmeaning that \u2014 I mean, let me repeat that:
p147
aV70 percent of the population in Stockholm
p148
aVwant to keep a price for something that used to be free.
p149
aa(lp150
VOkay. So why can that be? Why is that?
p151
aVWell, think about it this way. Who changed?
p152
aVI mean, the 20 percent of the car drivers that disappeared,
p153
aVsurely they must be discontent in a way.
p154
aVAnd where did they go? If we can understand this,
p155
aVthen maybe we can figure out how people can be so happy with this.
p156
aVWell, so we did this huge interview survey
p157
aVwith lots of travel services, and tried to figure out
p158
aVwho changed, and where did they go?
p159
aVAnd it turned out that they don't know themselves. (Laughter)
p160
aVFor some reason, the car drivers are \u2014
p161
aVthey are confident they actually drive the same way that they used to do.
p162
aVAnd why is that? It's because that travel patterns
p163
aVare much less stable than you might think.
p164
aVEach day, people make new decisions, and people change
p165
aVand the world changes around them, and each day
p166
aVall of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly
p167
aVaway from rush hour car driving
p168
aVin a way that people don't even notice.
p169
aVThey're not even aware of this themselves.
p170
aa(lp171
VAnd the other question, who changed their mind?
p172
aVWho changed their opinion, and why?
p173
aVSo we did another interview survey, tried to figure out
p174
aVwhy people changed their mind, and what type of group changed their minds?
p175
aVAnd after analyzing the answers, it turned out that
p176
aVmore than half of them believe that they haven't changed their minds.
p177
aVThey're actually confident that they have
p178
aVliked congestion pricing all along.
p179
aVWhich means that we are now in a position
p180
aVwhere we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon
p181
aVwith 20 percent, and reduced congestion by enormous numbers,
p182
aVand people aren't even aware that they have changed,
p183
aVand they honestly believe that they have liked this all along.
p184
aa(lp185
VThis is the power of nudges when trying to solve
p186
aVcomplex social problems, and when you do that,
p187
aVyou shouldn't try to tell people how to adapt.
p188
aVYou should just nudge them in the right direction.
p189
aVAnd if you do it right,
p190
aVpeople will actually embrace the change,
p191
aVand if you do it right, people will actually even like it.
p192
aVThank you. (Applause)
